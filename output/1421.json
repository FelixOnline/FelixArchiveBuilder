I was\ntrying to find an image of a\nmental, old lady modelling\nthese hats, but alas, I couldn\u2019t\nfind one. Why are these so\npopular with crazy, elderly\nwomen? I saw one the other\nday wearing these hats, she\nwas thrashing a bin in a vain\nattempt to \u2018rid the Nazis from\nbins because that\u2019s where\nthey belong.\u2019 A long message\nshort, I reckon these could\nlook hot on someone that is\nnot crazy and not collecting\ntheir pension. Girls only. Guys\nwill just look like knobs.\nLookbook.nu\nA site where people post their\nown \u2018individual\u2019 style. You can\ncatch out the very few with a\nreal sense of dress but most\nare just self-indulgent, emo\nkids not satisfied with the\ncoverage their \u2018angles\u2019 get on\nmyspace. For the egomaniac\nthat wanks in the mirror.\nPatent Trainers\nA strong prevalence of Italian\nand Japanese tourists are\nwandering around London\nadorning shiny shoes. A plain\n\u2018no\u2019 in the aesthetics depart-ment. Your shoes need to be\nstylishly understated. Not \u2018I\ncan see my own ugly face in\nmy upper\u2019. I don\u2019t dig them,\nand no one should. If I see you\nin them around College, beware of STAMP-STAMP TIME.\nSHIT\nIf you\u2019re like me, you\u2019ll grab a basketful of stuff in Urban Outfitters and Topshop, head to the till\nand tell the cashier that \u201cmy mum just died, so can you pity me by putting these in a bag and let\nme walk away casually with it please\u2026?\u201d Of course the next thing you know you\u2019re being escorted\nout of the shop.\nRemember that the Oxford Street Topshop has a \u201cvintage\u201d section but bollocks to that, because\ncharity shops exist for a reason. There are two areas near to Imperial with a high number of these\nshops, these are; a) North End Road (last time I checked there were at least 3 within 50m of each\nother) and b) Clapham Junction \u2013 at least 10 within a mile radius. Fish out stuff from discount bas-kets, fish out stuff in the over 50\u2019s section. To prove my point, check out the photo to the left. This\nbag cost \u00a37 but is worth a million to me.\nThe areas of Notting Hill and South Kensington have plenty of charity shops dotted around also\nand they even sell unwanted designer clothes. However allow me to patronise your clever brains\nby stating the obvious; 1) the risk you run by visiting these charity shops near the homes of bankers and rich French/Americans, is that the price tags are outrageously marked up to match the fat\npurses of the aforementioned and 2) If you feel so compelled to visit a charity shop around you\nnow, enter \u201cCharity Shop\u201d on Google Map and enjoy a good day of bargain hunting! Oh last but\nnot least, you should visit a charity shop on a Tuesday or Wednesday, as people clear their houses\nover the weekend and so the nice, charity-shop volunteers spend the Monday sorting the donations out ready for selling.\nThe Art of Cheapskating. Stylishly.\nThe rule with H&M and Zara is to never buy\nanything full price. (Yes, you eager cheapskates \u2013 I\nknow H&M is pretty cheap already but it won\u2019t hurt if\nour wallets weigh a little more, will it?) The appeal of\nH&M is its trendiness, for Zara it is its tale on chic-clas-sic; and for both, their \u2018unique\u2019 fashion pieces. During\nJanuary sales, shops usually dig out stuff they didn\u2019t\nmanage to sell last or last-last season and plunge the\nprice through the floor to around 10% of its original.\nOn the right is a military poncho coat I got from Zara\nlast January (for \u00a32.75!) and a crazy, frilly, chiffon shirt\nfrom H&M (\u00a35!), that never fails to turn heads and\ntransform its owner from Reese Wetherspoon to Gwen\nStefani (OK, not quite\u2026 but you get the idea).\nThe coat comes from TRF, the youth line of Zara but\nthe poor thing was buried under piles of boring Zara\nbasic t-shirts. Part of the reason it was cheap was because a button on the front had snapped in half but the\ncrown badge is enough of a focal point to distract from\nthe little flaw.\nfashion.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFashion\nFashion Editor \u2013 Dan Wan\nSICK\nThe ultimate mode of cheapskating is befriending your nan or your grandad. Sit through\nanother one of their Second World War stories\nand casually drop in \u201cUm, I wonder what you\nwore in your glorious youthful days?\u201d and offer a ladder to climb up to their attics and raid\ntheir unwanted items. There\u2019s nothing wrong\nwith topping your boyfriend jeans with a 40\nyear-old piece of knit wear. My nan used to be\na tailor so I am a proud owner of this 30 year-old coat pictured above. Of course it is always\nnice to pay a visit to your grans anyway, no\ndoubt.\nThe credit crunch, the recession, the Gaza\nConflict and exams. All the gloom in the universe seems to have jam-packed itself in to\nan angry Jack-in-the-box and punched hard\nin our innocent and unsuspecting faces.\nBut before we all become Prozac addicts,\nwhy don\u2019t we up our endorphin levels by\ntreating ourselves to a little retail therapy? A\ntherapy that this time, isn\u2019t going to affect the\nsize of our grocery baskets. A therapy that\nwill remove the drabness of your wardrobe,\nreinstalling it with rays and rays of golden\nlight.\nI have to boast about the godlike status of TKMaxx but I will\nkeep my thrill contained in two sen-tences. Here is what I got last week from\nthe \u201cSALE\u201d section for \u00a320. Wait, no \u2013 2D\njust doesn\u2019t do justice to this item\u2019s mag-nificence. You will have to open your little\neyes and look for a person milling around\ncampus wearing a short, fur coat. All I can\nadvise is for you to abandon your newspaper and visit a TKMaxx near you now.\nKawai Wong realises that everyone is down in the dumps, but reckons you can still look hot on the cheap.\n19\nFriday 23 January 2009 felix\n\n"

Although an improvement from\nlast year\u2019s figure of 61.5%, the results\nreleased on the 6th January 2009 are\nstill below the national average of 90%.\nThe fears raised by many students and\nprofessionals alike is still whether or\nnot the new system, known as UKFPO\nVersion 2.0 which is the 3rd reincarnation of the process since it started in\n2005, is a fair process.\nThe national application process is\nthe method by which medical students\nare assigned a hospital where they will\ndo their foundation course. In previous years, as part of their Pre-Registration House Officer [PRHO] year\n(i.e. the final year of medical training\nas and employee), medical students\nwere matched with a position in the\nhospital(s) linked to their individual\nmedical school, however this was technically illegal as it was not consistent\nwith employment laws. The system\nalso meant that medical students could\nnot apply to hospitals that were not\nlinked to their \u2018home\u2019 school, unless\nthey had received permission from\nthe Dean of their medical school. This\nparticular method of job assignment\nhad not been legally challenged; how-ever, when the new national selection\nsystem came into effect, and where\nthe PRHO year changed into foundation programme, it was inevitable that\nsome people would challenge the selection method on a legal basis, which\nthe medical schools would have lost as\nthe law was being broken.\nThe General Medical Council\n[GMC] had in the past recommended\nthat students \u201cundertake a PRHO post\nassociated with [their] medical school\u201d,\nthough since the new system came into\nfruition, this particular line of text has\nsince disappeared from their literature.\nIn the past, it was felt by the GMC that\nwith students remaining with effectively the same institution there would be\nan educational and pastoral continuity.\nIn light of the fact that the \u2018old system\u2019\nwas illegal, it is safe to assume that the\nGMC didn\u2019t want to be endorsing an illegal practise.\nWith the introduction of a national\napplication, it was immediately clear\nto the medical students in London that\nthey would suffer, since there were\nmore medical students in London than\nactual places in hospitals. ICSM, in\nthe past, had links with hospitals outside the London area to cope with the\nexcess number of students, however\nthese places have now gone with more\nand more medical schools opening.\nThe fact that there are more medical\nschools opening is another fact that\nhas caused concern, due to the lack\nof uniformity between the medical\nschools.\nWhen the new national application\nsystem was introduced in 2005, known\nas the Multi-Deanery Application\nProcess [MDAP], students applied directly for posts but a maximum of 40.\nThe MDAP was still not \u2018national\u2019 as it\nwasn\u2019t open to all posts in the country,\ninstead students could apply to one\nof two \u2018Units of Application\u2019 that had\na number of schools within them. After one year, the system was deemed\nto have been a disaster. Each student\nthat applied to a particular post was\nranked in order to allocate the posi-tion, yet there was no national guidelines for scoring, no academic ranking and poor consultation with senior\nmedical professionals. There was effectively no process in which all the\nstudents across the country could be\ncompared to. 20% of medical graduates\nin the country come from London, and\nin 2005, 250 London medical students\nwithout posts, 44% of the total number\nof unplaced posts. Of these 250, 39\nwere Imperial students and after clearing 11 were still without a post; the 11\nincluded prize-winners.\nThe fear that London students would\nbe displaced seemed to be true, and\nsince it was clear that the MDAP system was not working, a new system\nwas devised in 2006. The Medical\nTraining Application Service [MTAS]\ngave students the opportunity to apply\nto anywhere in the country, however\nthey would have to apply to a foundation school fist before they could apply\nto an individual post. Academic ranking was introduced for the first time,\nwith the results from that contributing\nto 45% of the overall score, something\nthat was felt would benefit Imperial\ngraduates. The problem that now occurred was that many of the Imperial graduates who were already in the\nbottom 50% of their year, didn\u2019t see\nthe point in applying to a North West\nThames Foundation School [NWTFS]\nwhere all their hospitals are located.\nThis resulted in fewer people applying\nto a post at a NWTFS, with the lower\nranked students opting to apply to a\nfoundation school outside London. As\na result 92% of Imperial graduates were\nallocated to their first choice of foundation schools.\nIn 2007, the MTAS was renamed\nthe United Kingdom Foundation Programmes Office [UKFPO]. The previous year saw only 352 applicants for\n321 posts in NWTFS, which gave the\nimpression to many students across\nthe country that it was relatively easy\nto get into a NWTFS. Back in 2007,\nNWTFS saw 552 applicants for a similar number of places, a figure that far\nsurpassed that of any other foundations school. As a result, only 61.5% of\nImperial finalists got their first choice\nfoundation school.\nWith a new year and a new round\nof medical students applying for posts\nat foundation schools, it is time for\na change to the application process.\nPoints allocated from academic merit decrease from 45% to 40% which\nmeans more of an emphasis is made\non the written part. This is of great\nbenefit to Imperial candidates as they\nhave scored higher on average than\nanyone else in this sector over the past\nfew years. On the academic front, the\nscoring for Q1 has increased, giving 4\npoints for a 2.1 BSc, something which\nmost Imperial candidates have.\nThere is no doubt that with the increased support from the ICSM Students\u2019 Union in the form of lectures on\nfilling out the application form, as well\nas tactical choices made by the students themselves, Imperial was able to\nobtain a higher proportion of students\ngetting their first choice. What is of\nmain concern still, even after 4 years,\nis the method by which these positions\nare allocated. There is no distinction\nbetween the qualities of students coming out from the various medical stu-dents. Effectively, people ranked in the\ntop quartile at Imperial are considered\nexactly the same as people from an\ninstitution that is lower in the league\ntables for medicine, who are also in the\ntop quartile at their school. The method of teaching various from school to\nschool, which again means that there\nwill be a difference in the quality of\nstudents graduating.\nAlthough the results this year are\nencouraging, the general consensus\nacross the Imperial board is that things\nneed to change, whether or not that is\ngoing to happen, only time will tell.\nNow in its third reincarnation, the selection process for final\nyear medical students has started to produce favourable results\nfor Imperial, but is it fair? felix Editor in Chief, Jovan Nedi\u0107,\ninvestigates the history and what the results say this year.\nWhat the college thinks\nWhat ICSMSU thinks\nWhat the students think\nProfessor Lord Robert Winston got the\n2009 RCSU Imperial College Science\nChallenge, supported by Shell, off to\na flying start last night, as he spoke at\nits launch. The event was attended by\nover 150 Imperial students and even\nthe Rector, Sir Roy Anderson, was\namongst the audience, with students\nand teachers from schools across the\nUnited Kingdom also logging in to\nwatch the event live online. Some even\nmade the journey to South Kensington to attend the event itself! Either\nthe free cakes and drinks on offer, or\nperhaps this year\u2019s prizes, must have\ncaught their attention \u2013 with the overall winner standing to pocket \u00a35,000\nfor only 800 words!\nFull details of this year\u2019s competition\nwere announced at the launch by the\nChair, Jad Marrouche, PhD student and\nformer President of the RCSU, who is\nrunning the event for the second time\nafter his many successes in 2006-2007.\nThe competition will follow a similar format to previous years, with the\naim being to write an 800-word essay\nin answer to one of four questions, set\nby a panel of judges, based on a scientific topic and its effects on the wider\nworld. There will once again be two\ncategories: one for students at Imperial\nCollege, and another, run in conjunction with Imperial Outreach, for school\nstudents across the United Kingdom.\n2009 Science Challenge\nLaunched!!\nProfessor Armand Leroi\nProfessor of Evolutionary Developmental\nBiology at Imperial College\n\u201cWill Homo sapiens\ncontinue to evolve,\nand, if so, how?\u201d\nThe Small-Print\nAll entries must be submitted online\nat http://sciencechallenge.org, and received by 23.59 on the 2nd March.

We need to help our\nstudents create the strongest\npossible applications to increase their chance of securing their preferred Foundation\nplacement.\u201d\nProf. J. Higham\nHead of Undergraduate\nMedicine\nguided tours of the National Physical\nLaboratory, the facilities at CERN in\nGeneva and a Shell alternative energy\nlaboratory.\nAnd just when you thought that was\nall, John Sanderson of the RCSA has\nonce again given generously to the\ncause, donating once-in-a-lifetime\n(non-scientific!) prizes to the winners\n\u2013 two tandem flights on a paraglider\nfor the winning school student and two\ntrial lessons on a light aircraft for the\nwinning Imperial student\u2026who said\nscience couldn\u2019t be fun\u2026?\npassing onto each judge the top ten\nessays based on their question. Each\njudge will then select the winning essay for each of the two categories and\nthen all four judges will decide upon\nthe overall winners, who will be announced at the Grand Final event, to\nbe held on the 13th March at an as-yet\nundisclosed location. With previous\nGrand Finals including sell-out events\nat The Ritz Hotel and The Science Museum, you can bet this will be one not\nto miss!\nThe Science Challenge website has\nalso had an extensive re-development\nand is now available, complete with full\ndetails of the competition, previous\nwinning essays and information about\nhow to enter, all of which can be found\nat the conveniently named http://sci-encechallenge.org.\n\u201cNot being a huge supporter of the UKFPO application system, I applied feeling apprehensive and\nunsure of how things would turn out especially\nafter last years statistics for ICSM. I received\nmy first choice deanery but there are still a lot\nof problems in the system that need to be ad-dressed. The computer system this year worked\nand did not crash but the system for selecting\njobs seemed clumsy and once the jobs were\nselected in preferences it was impossible to click\na link to observe the job details for refining your\nselection. Maybe this could be reviewed for next\nyear.\u201d\nAubery Smith\n6th Year Medic\nImperial medical students doing their thing\n\u201cImperial College School of Medicine Students\u2019\nUnion is extremely happy that our final year\nstudents fared better this year compared to\nprevious years. North West Thames Foundation School is still a particularly hard school to\nget into, and we, in collaboration with the other\nLondon medical schools, are in the process of investigating how heavily skewed\nthe results are considering so\nmany final years did not apply\nto our home school as a consequence of last years results.\nWhilst we are pleased with the\nresult, we will still be pushing\nfor educational continuity in reform to the allocation process.\u201d\nMark Chamberlain\nICSMSU President\nPast RCSU President Jad Marrouche at the launch yesterday\nPHoto by Tom Roberts\n\n"

1st\nICBC Winter Training Camp: On\nJanuary 2, 2009 Imperial College Boat\nClub established an elite school for the\ntop one percent of its rowers. Its purpose was to teach the lost art of erging\ncombat and to insure that the handful\nof men who graduated were the best\nrowers in the world. They succeeded.\nToday, ICBC calls it Fighter Weapons\nSchool. The rowers call it: TOP GUN.\nThe Long Defeat took place at ICBC\nbase camp with over 210 kilometres\ncovered and thousands of weight repetitions endured over 8 gruelling days.\nThe erg plinking began before light\neach morning and continued past\ndarkness. As the splits decreased the\ninjured list increased. Gareth \u2018Gungho\u2019 Brown had a permanent change\nof station to the bikes suffering from\na torn ligament in his finger. Bom\nMeyrick-Cole was struck with tendonitis in both wrists, Alex Gillies had to\nforgo the ergo due to back pain while\nWinny took his slashed hands to the\nbike: mentally and physically defeated.\nThe million dollar wound went to Will\nTodd and his great balls of fire who had\nto keep a low heart rate after a brief\nflirtation with a hospital drip earlier\nin the year. The women\u2019s squad were\nnot impervious to injury either with\nChewy complaining of severe bum\npain throughout the week.\nAnyone not holding formation or\noverrating in the erg zone was immediately fragged by fellow comrades.\nTower Trapmore assumed control\nof the observation post and cries of\n\u201cHooyah\u201d echoed throughout the gym.\nPosture calls in the final leg of the 18\nkm pieces were efficient morale boost-ers. The promise of bacon butties for\nthe biggest improvement of splits in\nthe 20 minute pieces became the force\nmultiplier with Louise Hart and AFP\nsmelling the pan the strongest.\nBetween sessions in the mess hall\npasta was shovelled into battle-weary\ntroops who displayed early signs of the\nthousand yard stare, oblivious to the\nWorld\u2019s Strongest Man being shown\non the TV screen behind.\nCrews had been pre-selected for water outings, consequently Trapmore\nhad no patience for anyone wishing to\nleave ground-zero early: \u201cTower, this is\nGhost rider requesting a flyby.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s\na negative Ghost rider, the pattern is\nfull.\u201d\nMeanwhile, Whitelaw the Outlaw\nwas overseeing core stability operations and was responsible for calling\nstation changes. Roll-outs proved to\nbe the catastrophic kill for exhausted\nbodies. In the weights room it was\ntoo close for missiles and all squads\nswitched to guns for the 4 x 25 sets.\nThe B-hut in the flat upstairs became\na safe haven from the constant grinding of spirit below. Rowers, now a mere\nshadow of their former selves could be\nfound sprawled in rooms and hallways\nwith offerings of tea providing brief\nglimpses of hope to crushed souls. At\nthe End of Day, crews yomped home\ntrying to blank out thoughts of the impending torture of yet another day at\ncamp.\nMemos of nights out from non-row-ing friends were placed securely in file\n13.\nThe Awkward squad who couldn\u2019t\nmake daytime sessions could be heard\nerging late into the night desperately\nrecording splits to offer up to and\nplease the Tower. Sweat, blood and\ntears: he shows no emotion.\nA week of pain and what have we\nlearned?

St George\u2019s proved\nto be extremely efficient in the scrum\nwinning all of their own and many IC\nput-ins too.\nIC were, however, able to capitalise\non their poor body positions at the\nbreakdown and were competitive at\nbreakdowns which ordinarily should\nhave been considered safe-balls.\nThe added possession that IC gained\nthrough this lead to progressive play,\nmore territory and eventually superb\nbreakaway try by the previously shames\nscrum-half Louie lead to a converted\ntry \u2013 12-0.\nCredit should be given to St George\u2019s\nwho never gave up and spent the last\n10 minutes of the game camped inside\nthe IC 22-line. The IC 4ths, however,\nwere determined to achieve their first\nclean sheet of the season and held firm\nto remain undefeated in 2009.\nFinian McCann\nRugby success!\nIt was an under strength men\u2019s 2nd\nfencing team that made the arduous\ntrek out to Uxbridge to fence Brunel.\nWith regular sabreur Charlie Hennings feverishly occupied with exams\nit fell upon 2nd team regulars Nathan\n\u201cBicycle\u201d Blundell and Nathan \u201cBadger\u201d Harmston to join team captain\nMaurice \u201cBerk\u201d Berk in fencing sabre.\nTheir lack of experience with fencing\nthis unfamiliar weapon seemed to have\nlittle effect as both Bicycle and Badger\nwon their first matches 5-2 and Berk\nmade it a hat trick with a 5-3 victory.\nBicycle and Berk struggled against\ntheir second opponents, going down\nto 5-7 and 5-6 losses respectively but\nBadger ensured IC remained in the lead\nwith a fine 5-4 win. With both Bicycle\nand Badger brushing aside their final\nopponents, even Berk\u2019s disappointing\n5-9 capitulation in the final match was\nenough to secure a win for Imperial in\nsabre, with the final scores at 45 \u2013 35.\nNext was foil and Badger and Bicycle\nwere back in their element, joined by\n2nd team stalwart Alex \u201cLeukaemia\u201d\nBishop. With no absent foilists, IC\nwere bullish but Badger\u2019s woeful 5-1\nloss in the first match required a swift\nrescue from on-form Blundell who\nslaughtered his first opponent 9-4.\nHaving narrowly snatched back the\nlead, IC threw it away in the next round\nof matches, with Leukaemia in particular struggling against the opposing anchor in a match that ended 3-9. However, some fine fencing in the final foil\nmatches, capped by a stunning display\nBrunel get a battering\nby Bicycle in the final contest, gave IC\na narrow margin of victory, final foil\nscores standing at 45-40.\nWith IC fifteen points in the lead\ngoing in to epee and having won the\nfirst two weapons, thirty points would\nbe enough to ensure a victory for IC.\nHowever, with the usual epeeists ab-sent, victory was hardly assured.\nBerk, fencing competitive epee for\nthe first time in years, settled IC\u2019s\nnerves with a 5-3 win in the opening\nmatch, before new man Guillaume\nDrieu La Rochelle floundered his way\nto a 2-7 loss. Leukaemia also struggled,\nlosing 3-5 in his first match and clearly\nconfused by the nuances of epee fenc-ing. However with Berk continually\nturning out passable performances and\nLeukaemia and Guillaume doing a decent job of damage limitation, a final\nepee score of 37-45 in Brunel\u2019s favour\nwas more than enough to give Imperial\nthe win.\nIC pair to represent England\nBarely a year old but already Imperial\nCollege Union Gaelic Athletics Association (GAA) have their first international representatives. Finian McCann\nand Stephen Gallagher were recently\nannounced as members of the England\nUniversities hurling team to face their\nScottish counterparts on 31 January in\nLeeds. While the club primarily plays\nGaelic football, as members of the\nGAA we also participate in hurling.\nThis is a sport not unlike hockey in\nthat players use a specially shaped stick\ncalled a cam\u00e1n to hit a small ball called\na sliothar. However, the scoring is a bit\ndifferent, you can lift the ball into your\nhand and hit it in the air, and is quite a\nbit more physical.\nThis is a massive boost for the\nclub which has progressed leaps and\nbounds from that dreary February\nmorning last year up in Oxford. New\nkits, our own Gaelic football pitch in\nHarlington and our first wins against\nCambridge and the University of East\nAnglia in November are all signs that\nthe club is healthy and prospering.\nThe next big event for the club is our\nfirst ever entry into the BUCS Gaelic\nFootball Championship, taking place\nthis year in Birmingham on 7-8 February, which we have all intentions of\nwinning.

Frankly, the city is only\nworth visiting for the show (which is\nnot open to the public), or if you\u2019re into\ngambling and staring at fake tits.\nApparently there were significantly\nfewer visitors this year; probably only\n60%oflastyear\u2019sfigure,andweallknow\nthe reason. Nevertheless, new gadgets\nwere still pouring out over the four-day\nevent, which took up large floor areas\nof several convention centres and ho-tels. Here\u2019s an idea of the event\u2019s scale:\nas a favour for a Hong Kong audiophile\nmagazine, I took photos of every single\nroom at the High Performance Audio\n& Home Theatre area, which occupied\nabout 300 suites that took up five floors\nat The Venetian, and that alone took\nme two and a half days (bear in mind\nI literally only snapped a few shots in\neach room and didn\u2019t sit down to listen\nto the systems)! If that wasn\u2019t enough,\nI still had the Las Vegas Convention\nCenter (LVCC), Sands Expo, Renaissance and Hilton Hotel to explore!\nIn the remaining days I only managed\nto cover some parts of the LVCC \u2013 the\nmain venue of the show \u2013 and Sands\nExpo. As many CES regulars suggested,\nI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if it took an entire month to see absolutely everything\non show. Not only were my legs knack-ered, but my chapped lips (the harsh\nwinds of San Francisco didn\u2019t play nice-ly) and insufficient sleep also challenged\nmy temper. Fortunately, the sight of fun\nand rare gadgets overcame my darker\nthoughts, otherwise I may have made\nthe Vegas headlines following some sort\nof mental-breakdown behaviour.\nAnyway, enough moaning. Enjoy the\nrest of the article!\nHighlights of CES 2009, Las Vegas\nRichard Lai heads to the US, gains weight and picks out some of the best gadgets in the international show\nTelevisions\nHave a strong\nopinion on a\ngadget?\nWant to share\na review?\nSend in your article and high-resolution pictures or links\nto felix@imperial.ac.uk, and\ninclude \u201cTechnology section\u201d\nin the e-mail subject.\nThis year there were four distinct\ncategories of TVs: the large, the\nthin, the eco-friendly and the 3D\ndisplays. While TV sizes had always been the main driving force of\nthe competition, many companies\nsee that eco-awareness is opening\na new market. Companies such as\nSony, Panasonic and Toshiba had\ngreen booths comparing live power\nconsumption of current TV models\nand new eco-friendly ones, as well\nas posters pointing out the recyclable materials used.\nThe electronic companies also\nbelieve that 3D display is the future.\nSony was displaying their 3D models that require viewers to wear\nspecial glasses \u2013 quite an inconvenience for four-eyed peeps like\nmyself \u2013 but apparently Samsung\ncame up with a TV that displays\n3D right out of the box. Sadly Samsung was the only large booth that\nI failed to get to, so I\u2019ll make sure I\ncheck them out next time.\nLG\u2019s extremely thin and colourful OLED TVs, only 0.85mm thick!\nPanasonic\u2019s 1/3 inch plasma TV\nStorage Media\nSDXC \u2013 the next-gen SD that gives you 32GB to 2TB capacity\nNow that the HD format war is\nover, the spotlight is returning to\nsolid-state memory. As you can\nsee above, the SD Association announced the SDXC specification,\ngiving you massive storage capacities of 32GB up to 2TB on the\ntiny cards, and transfer speed of\n104MB/sec (up to 300MB/sec in\nthe future). The final specification\nwill be released to manufacturers\nnext month, so expect to see SDXC\ncards and compatible devices in\nstores in about three months\u2019\ntime.\nSanDisk made a big presence at\nthe show too, actively promoting\ntheir SSD products for laptops,\nnotably the high-speed 240GB 2.5\u201d\nSATA-II SSD, which will be available directly from their website for\n$499 by mid-2009.\nSanDisk claims their latest SSDs are 5 times faster than HDDs\n\u201cNext-gen\u201d Gaming\nI came across a couple of very cool\ngaming products, both of which\ncan be categorised as \u201cnext-gen\u201d\ngaming, since they don\u2019t require\nconventional controllers.\nFor example, Mattel\u2019s Mindflex\n(pictured left) consists of a small\nobstacle course platform, on which\nhovers a small purple ball supported by air blown from below, and the\nplayer controls the strength of the\nfan with his/her mind (theta-wave\nactivity detected by a head band),\nand the X-Y coordination controlled by hand. Not bad for $80, huh?\nAnother cool technology that the\ngame industry should look into is\nGestureTek\u2019s 3D gesture recogni-tion. As pictured on the right, a\ncamera captures live 3D images\nand translates gestures into instructions \u2013 in this case, steering and acceleration of a virtual car (moving\nthe fists apart accelerates, and vice\nversa). As far as I could see, the videogame\u2019s responded very well.\nGestureTek has also collaborated\nwith Hitachi and 3D sensor maker,\nCanesta, to create a gesture-con-trolled TV. A lazy man\u2019s dream? Driving game sans steering wheel\nMindflex \u2013 a mind control game\nComputers\nThis year\u2019s CES saw the birth of\nSony\u2019s first Intel Atom powered\nlaptop, but the Japanese company\ninsists the P Series is not a netbook.\nSony\u2019s Vice President, Mike Abary,\nwas quoted saying the P Series is\ntargeted at the premium market,\nof which the \u201ccustomer probably\ndoesn\u2019t even know what a netbook\nis\u201d. Frankly, we think this is just an\nexcuse to justify the \u00a3849-or-higher\npricetag. Nevertheless, the \u201claptop\u201d\nfelt good on hand, especially with\nthe generously-sized keyboard, but\nyou\u2019re stuck with a nipple instead\nof a trackpad sadly. The small high-resolution screen (8\u201d, 1600x768) is\ngreat for moies on the go, yet the\ndevice is crippled by a shabby 2hr\n45min battery life.\nElsewhere,whatdidexcitemewas\nthe ASUS Eee PC T101H prototype\n(pictured top, right hand column) \u2013\nthe first Eee-branded tablet PC.

It\u2019s rumoured to\nbe priced at a mere $600, and will\ncome out in Q1 this year.\nA quick browse around MSI\u2019s\nbooth found a MacBook-Air-lookalike X320 (pictured bottom right).\nWeighing just 1.3kg with a 4-cell\nbattery (60g lighter than Air!),\nsporting two USB ports instead of\none, and coming in three colour\noptions (black, silver and white).\nThe X320 might do slightly better\nthan the Air.

The idea is that unlike traditional Bluetooth speak-ers, products developed using this\nSDK do not require a hardwire-link\nbetween the left speaker and right\nspeaker. To make this possible, one\nof the speakers acts as the master,\nwhich buffers the data stream from\nthe audio source, and then relays\nthe appropriate data to the slave\nspeaker. The developed products\nwill work with any existing A2DP\n(Advanced Audio Distribution\nProfile, for streaming high quality\nstereo audio) devices. CSR\u2019s TrueWireless Stereo SDK kills another wire\nIf you\u2019ve been at Imperial long\nenough then you might recognise\nthis guy on the left: Mr. Haider Bahrani was an M.Sc. student with the\nControl & Power Research Group\nin the EEE department, and before\nthat he studied electronic engineer-ingatKingstonUniversity,wherehe\nmet his close friend and later business partner, Remo Casadei. After\nfinishing his M.Sc. in 1994, Haider\njoined Remo to launch Sonneteer\nand their first product shown at\nCES \u2013 the Campion amplifier \u2013\nwas actually Haider\u2019s improved final year project from Kingston!\nAt the showroom, Haider proudly showed me the freshly-launched\nMorpheus \u2013 a slick, hand-made\n\u00a32200 high-end music centre that\nplays \u201cmusic from all your home\ncomputers, the Internet, memory\nsticks and your mobile phone\u201d and\nmany more. Really impressive!\nMr. Haider Bahrani, an Imperial alumnus, next to the Morpheus\nLast but not least: you may recall in\nmy Stuff Live coverage last term, I\nmentioned the much-hyped portable\nDJ device, the Pacemaker by Tonium\nof Sweden. Well, on Day 0 of CES I\ncaught sight of fellow Brit DJ Tristan\nda Cunha (left), who demonstrated the\nPacemaker for me at Stuff Live, and\nthen we bumped into each other again\non the train after the London show. I\ndidn\u2019t manage to catch him then, but as\nI was out night-sightseeing on Day 2, I\nbumped into Tristan outside a casino!\nWhat a small, small world.\nAnyway, it turned out Tristan was the\nlone Brit in the Swedish group \u2013 that\u2019s\nhow good of a DJ he is! I then went to\nhis booth on Day 4 to check out Pacemaker\u2019s software update, and boy I was\npleased: the UI \u201chas been completely\nreworked\u201d for user-friendliness, and\nit now has auto beat match \u2013 a crucial\nfeature that was greatly missed in the\nfirst generation software. When the\n60GB version comes out in Spring for\n\u00a3300, I might actually have to get one.\nTonium\u2019s DJ Tristan da Cunha Tonium Pacemaker DJ device\nThe ugly stuff...\nMore cool stuff...\nWowWee Joebot can beatbox! Fujitsu PalmSecure system\nI take back all my comments regarding how silly it is to keep robotic pets. WowWee\u2019s Joebot has\nconvinced me that I should get one:\nnot only can you fight it with any IR\nremotes, but the comic robot can\nalso beatbox and dance! I\u2019m sold!\nAs for the PalmSecure, this authentication system reads your palm\nvein pattern, requiring no physical\ncontact, making it an ideal system\nfor hospital security. The actual\nsensor is only slightly bigger than\nthe average water bottle cap.\nI had a proper \u201cWTF\u201d moment\nwhen I saw these head-swinging\n(and no doubt head-shaking for us)\niPod speakers.\nMore hilarious still was that sat at\nthe top of the animal kingdom was\n\u201cHappy Obama\u201d (congratulations,\nby the way).

Write for us.\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n17\nFriday 23 January 2009 felix\nArts\nCaz Knight\nArts Editor\nT\nhe second term\u2019s, second\ninstallment of the new,\nconcise felix arts. In this\nbusy term, we are opting\nfor quality over quantity:\nyou may see fewer pages but what you\ndo read will be great stuff.\nFirst, and most importantly, I would\nlike to apologise profusely to my good\nfriend and arts connoisseur, Rosie Milton for a mistake in last week\u2019s issue.\nThe Magnificence of the Tsars review\nwas advertised as being written by me\nhowever, the article was written by Rosie (people familiar with my articles\nmay have noticed a marked difference\nin style and perception concerning\nart!). We are very sorry, Rosie.\nMy recent trip to the National Theatre to see Every Good Boy Deserves\nFavour, reinforced some conclusions I\nhave made concerning how we, as hu-mans/biological entities, enjoy art (be\nit theatre, concerts and anything else\nthat falls under the category).\nThe brain, our processing organ, is\nlike any muscle in our body \u2013 it gets\ntired. After extended periods of use\nand a dip in its only source of fuel,\nglucose, its ability to concentrate or\nengage enthusiastically in tasks is im-paired. At least in my case. No wonder\nthen that tiredness will kill any enjoyment and appreciation of the culture\nthat surrounds us.\nOnce tiredness sets in, I turn from\nart lover to art despiser. Therefore, it is\nworth considering whether one is suitably refreshed before visiting a gallery\nor production.\nThe size of an exhibition or length of\na play will also try our patience if it is\nunending.\nOf course, one cannot reduce Shakespeare\u2019s great works to one hour summaries just for the sake of this generation\u2019s attention-deficient personalities,\nused to everything fast- from food to\nInternet connections.\nI went to see the Francis Bacon exhibition at the beginning of the academic\nyear and found that ten large rooms of\nhis work is just too much to take in and\nenjoy in one sitting. Especially as one\nis not permitted to re-enter the gallery space after a coffee break, as is the\nnorm in all exhibitions where a ticket\nis required.\nEvery Good Boy Deserves Favour is\none of the shortest plays I have seen.\nAt one hour five minutes it flies by, yet\npacks in just as much as a longer play\nwithout seeming rushed. I left feeling\nuplifted with energy, left to go and pursue the rest of the evening.\nA relatively recent play to appear at\nthe West End, Ivanov, also adapted by\nTom Stoppard from Chekov, is three\nhours of beauty but leaves one emotionally drained and ready for bed.\nIn my experience, the smaller exhibitions have always been the more enjoyable for myself (content permitting), as\nI leave not resenting them for sapping\nall my mental energy in trying to digest\na large amount.\nReviewed here are two pieces from\ntheatreland; my review of Tom Stoppard\u2019s previously mentioned EGBDF\nand stand-up comedy from Bill Bailey.\nHopefully, this \u2018abridged\u2019 version of\narts will satisfy your hunger and leave\nyou wanting more next week. Expect\nphotography from Annie Leibowitz\nand a sneak peak into dance institution\nSadler\u2019s Wells.\nShort but sweet\nHe\u2019s got soul but he\u2019s not a soldier\nBill Bailey makes squeal even the most stony-faced at his intimate show, Tinseltown, says Jessica Bland\nB\nill Bailey says he has been\nunemployed for twenty\n-three years; I say that Bill\nBailey has been one of the\nmost intelligent comics on\nstage for the last twenty three years\nand it is this intellect that has made\nhis show at the Gielgud Theatre such\na success.\nOften accused of gimmickry and unnecessary diversion by critics, Bailey\u2019s\nstand-up shows sell out large arenas on\nthe back of his TV persona rather than\ngood reviews.\nBut as Tinselworm nears the end of\nits West End run, this reviewer cannot\nsee anything other than a well-honed,\nwell-balanced, couple of hours awaiting the final few audiences.\nPerhaps this is just because practice\nmakes perfect. After a couple of years\nof touring, Bailey has had enough\nsense to cull the stuff that is not getting\nlaughs. But there is more to it than that.\nThe Gielgud is more intimate than the\nbig venues Bailey has often performed\nat previously and it is in only in this\nkind of space that he shines. It is here\nthat the comic who made us squeal\nat the television in Black Books (stage\nversion rumoured to be coming soon)\nor as team captain in Never Mind the\nBuzzcocks, comes to life.\nBailey has an unassuming, almost\nnervous demeanour. This insecurity\ndraws you in; it makes you feel like you\nare listening to the old-rocker guy behind the bar at your local. That is, until\nhe suddenly drops in a comedy gold\nnugget, so bright that your eyes start\nto water.\nWhether its the hoodie in a \u201csolipsistic trance \u201d or a rant about song lyrics that \u201cwrangled like an unreplaced\nGlade plug-in\u201d, Bailey cracked even the\nmost stoney-faced audience members\nNever mind the Buzzzzzcocks. Tinseltown, move over for Tinselworm\nsat near me (including my father, who\napparently hasn\u2019t laughed so hard since\nseeing Mr Izzard circa. 1997).\nEven the musical interludes were\nimproved since his stadium tour. Demonstrating the nonsense of The Killers\u2019\nchorus \u201cI got soul, but I\u2019m not a soldier\u201d\nby replacing it with \u201cI got Ham, but I\u2019m\nnot Hamster\u201d has been a stalwart of his\nact for sometime.\nBut it was the other ludicrous suggestions he threw out this time that really made the joke: \u201cI got May, but I\u2019m\nnot a Major\u201d being my favourite.\nThere is only just over a week left to\nsee Bailey at his best, so if you can get\ntickets (and I recommend seatwave.\ncom if you want to try)\nGo, giggle and be thankful that London still has somewhere other than\narena venues \u2013 somewhere just right\nfor bringing out what makes Bill Bailey\nso truly great.\nJoseph Millsom, as political dissident Alexander Ivanov in Every Boy Deserves Good Favour, looking\nuncannily like John Malkovich\nNotes on a schizophrenic society\nTom Stoppard mixes side-clutching humour with poignant ethical dilemmas in his play Every Good Boy\nDeserves Favour at the National Theatre. Caz Knight is very impressed.\nA\ntriangle-player worth\nmillions with his own or-chestra? No. A triangle-player worth millions\nwith his own imaginary\norchestra? Still, no. A lunatic triangle\n-player with his own orchestra sharing\na room in a psychiatric hospital with a\npolitical dissident? Now, that\u2019s something to write about.\nTom Stoppard and Andre Previn\u2019s\ncollaboration is a play, performed in\nconjunction with and bound up by a\nsymphony orchestra. First performed\nin 1977 starring Ian Mackellen as political dissident, Alexander Ivanov, and\nPatrick Stewart as a Soviet Union employed \u2018psychiatrist\u2019, this production\nis a union of exceptional creative talent with the ever sharp, hilarious, and\nfast-paced writing of Stoppard, teamed\nwith the score composition of multi-talented, Oscar-winning composer\nand conductor Andre Previn.\nAfter months of reading about Russian political dissidents and the group\narrested in Red Square in August 1968,\nfollowing protests against the Warsaw\npact invasion of Czechoslovakia, Stoppard met Victor Fainberg who had\nsurvived years in the prison-hospital\nsystem after being pronounced insane on account of his protests. Once\nfree, Fainberg doubled his efforts for\nhis colleagues still under abuse in this\nsystem. One of them, Victor Bukovsky,\nhad served consecutive hard labour\nand prison terms for his revelations\nabout the abuse in A Manual on Psychiatry for Dissidents, co-written with\na fellow prisoner (also a psychiatrist).\nThe play is dedicated to both Fainberg\nand Bukovsky.\nAlexander Ivanov is a political dissident imprisoned, released and then\nre-imprisoned in a psychiatric hospital for his own political protests. He\nis deemed mentally ill on account of\nhis opinions which, according to his\ndoctor, are his symptoms. He will be\nreleased on the condition that he accepts being mentally ill and that his\ntreatment in the facility was satisfactory and effective. Refusing to do this,\ngiven his barbaric treatment by USSRemployed wardens, the hospital get Alexander\u2019s son, Sacha, to persuade him\notherwise.\nPerformed at the National Theatre,\nthe Olivier\u2019s revolving stage is made\nexcellent use of in rotating the entire\norchestra over the course of the one\nhour play, amid which the action en-sues. This creates a gloriously eerie\nand surreal effect enhanced by dry ice\naplenty and the trance-like dancing of\nAlexander\u2019s cell/ward-mate (also Alexander Ivanov) to his imaginary symphony orchestra, played with endearing conviction by Toby Jones.\nThe surrealism is enhanced by the\nobscure image of seeing a sublime sinfonia in the middle of a grim, East-bloc\nprison-cum-loony bin.\nThe Southbank Sinfonia, led by Simon Over, have made a stunning effort to entwine dialogue in with the\nbeautiful music that brings the play to\nlife from within the first few seconds,\nafter an introduction of a few bashed\nout notes on the triangle from the\n\u2018conductor\u2019, Ivanov. The Sinfonia are\nsuccessful in their aim of discovering\nnew possibilities for the way in which\nclassical music can be performed, yet\nnever compromising their quality or\nseriousness.\nThe presence of the orchestra in\nthe play does more than delight our\nears. When it was first performed, it\nwould have been a potent comment\non a highly orchestrated society which\ndid its best not to upset the West and\nmaintain an image of control and or-der: they had no political prisoners,\nonly those unfortunate enough to suffer mental illness.\nThe notion of an orchestra quickly\nbecomes associated with the insane.\nWhen it is brought to light that the\nhospital\u2019s doctor plays the violin in\none, the orchestra\u2019s connotation is reinforced with one of corruption as well\nas of madness, with dissidents the discordant notes that must be eliminated\nto allow smooth play.\nThe play evokes arguments regarding the age-old debate of freedom of\nspeech but Every Good Boy Deserves\nFavour is as much a comment on today\u2019s Russia as it would have been in\n1977. The \u2018bad old days\u2019 referred to by\nSacha\u2019s teacher regarding those of Stalin, are also now \u2013 according to Bukovsky, it was, and still is, a schizophrenic\nsociety where one thing is thought, another said, a third one done.\nThe hilarity of Stoppard\u2019s writing\ndoes sometimes leave the gravity of\nwhat prisoners of conscience like Bukovsky and Fainberg would have experienced forgotten. Yet, Joseph Millson\u2019s\nunwavering seriousness and intensity\nas the dissident Ivanov brings these\nhorrors back every time he speaks, giving us a production that has us giggling\nand grinning one minute and ready to\nbring down unjust political systems in\nanother.\nToby Jones as Alexander Ivanov, conductor of his imaginary orchestra: \u201cI\u2019ve always had an orchestra!!\u201d\nPolitical dissident, Alexander Ivanov: a discordant note in an orchestrated society\n\n"

    "content": "sport.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n36 Friday 23 January 2009\nfelix\nSport\n37\nfelix\nFriday 23 January 2009\nGood afternoon Ben, first things\nfirst how have you found this\nyear in the Medics 1st team?\nIt has been a good year. It has been a\nchallenging first half of the season for\nthe first team, but the hockey club is\ngoing well both on and off the pitch.\nWhat are your main challenges\nyou have come across this year?\nThe first thing we have had trouble\nwith is numbers this year as we have\nquite an old team. So we have quite a\nlot of them away on placements. A few\nof the games last year we had almost\nhalf the team away. We had to make\nthe best of what we had.\nI don\u2019t think the results are reflective of our play this year. We have lost\nmost of our games by only one goal\nin the last five minutes which points\nto a lack of concentration. I hope the\nnext half of the season will be a bit of\na turn around. Almost all our games in\nthe first half of the season were away\ngames, so hopefully we will do better\nthis half.\nMore on personal issue, how\nhave you advanced from first year\nmedical student to your current\nposition as 1st XI captain?\nI actually started with rowing in my\nfirst year but I played a lot of hockey\nat school and I decided to start rowing as a break. I always had quite close\ncontact with the hockey guys and really just progressed from there. Again,\nit was quite an old team when I started\nin second year but it soon became a\nyoung team when they all left. In my\nthird year I played a quite a big role\nplaying centre midfield and this year I\nwent one better.\nWhy did you leave the rowing\nclub?\nThe rowing was good. I had a lot of\nfun rowing but it was too cold and the\nearly mornings were too much for me.\nEven though the Medics rowing is a bit\nmore relaxed than the IC rowing, there\nare still some early mornings and I\u2019m\nnot a morning person.\nOK. With the medical students\nhaving six years worth of students how have you found that\nin developing your team. Or do\nyou think it has had a negligible\neffect in comparison to IC teams\nwho only have three maybe four\nyears?\nYeah\u2026 although they only have three\nor four years the IC team have a wider\nselection to choose from. Six years is\ngood because you get a lot of experience and knowledge from the older\nyears and that\u2019s really good for both the\nhockey and social side. It is almost like\na family base as a club.\nIf you are there for six years then\nyou get to see the club develop and\nprogress. We are still an up and coming club and we have a committee for\nthe first time this year so we are making tracks now towards a tour hopefully coming up in September.\nHow long the club has been in\nexistence?\nMy club captain will tell you it was\nestablished in 1909, the actual date is\nunsure. This is our centenary year.\nAny celebrations lined up?\nWe are always celebrating! The tour\nwill be a good start so September is\ngoing to be to Barcelona with about\n30 guys to a student camp with four\ngames in a week so it should be good.\nMoving on to the big day \u2013 Varsity. How do you realistically see\nyour chances against College?\nGood. I know Jack doesn\u2019t see it as a\nproblem at the moment. They did, last\nyear, take us apart really in the first half\nbut I take full responsibility for that\nwith a poor formation choice. But we\nchanged it in the second half and we\ncoped with them very well and the second half score was 2-1 to us.\nWe have got a coach in now which\nwe have had for a few sessions and I\nthink realistically we are going to get\nbetter and better. We have got a full\nstrength side for the match at Varsity \u2013\nI am excited. I think we could do well,\nbut as far as I know we have never won\nVarsity. Last year we did come close\nhowever as it was tied with the ULU\nCup Final and we only lost on flicks.\nNow to the flagship event, how\ndo you think the Medical rugby\nteam are going to get on?\nI know a lot of the medics rugby guys\nand I think they are going to do another good job. It was close last year.\nToo close but great to watch. I\u2019ve been\nthere every year and it gets closer and\ncloser. I think the medics have still got\nan edge.\nWhere do you see the hockey club\nprogressing before you graduate?\nAny hopes of promotion or are\nyou aiming to stay in your BUCS\nleague?\nBefore the start of the season, we\nwere quite keen on moving up the\nBUCS league but because of our difficult first half of the season, we\u2019re looking to survive in our BUCS division\nwhich I think is a reachable goal.\nNext season we want to solidify ourselves in the league and then move up\nto the top. I think we could push for\npromotion depending on the intake.\nWe only tend to get one or two outstanding freshers that can make it onto\nthe first team. As a medical school, I\nthink the league we\u2019re in is very good\n\u2013 making a first division league is chal-lenging, especially with the likes of\nICHC who are very good, and Canterbury who are also very good.\nHow much have Sport Imperial\nand the union supported you?\nThey\u2019ve been really good. If you\never need to get hold of them, you\ncan email, phone, anyway you need to.\nThey\u2019re always available to help with\nhockey matches and they\u2019ve provided\nus with our kit for the last season, and\nthis year\u2019s 1st team shirts.\nWhat are the unenjoyable aspects\nof being 1st XI captain?\nI actually don\u2019t like two aspects -Taking training I find quite stressful\nand I miss playing my own game. Also\nI do find it difficult to pick the team especially as we\u2019ve got a very strong 2nd\nWith a little over a month until Varsity, the Medical Schools hockey 1st XI captain Ben Saunders is\ninterviewed by the unbiased, non-hockey playing sports editor Mustapher Botchway.\nteam. They\u2019re doing well this year so its\nhard to not be able to include some of\ntheir better players.\nOn a lighter note, what are the\nmain hockey social events of the\nyear?\nIn October we go on a tour to Oxford where we play a mixed team but\nwe spend a couple of nights there and\nthat\u2019s an awesome weekend. We had a\nChristmas curry which was very good.\nThe big one is the AGM in April/\nMay time and is always very good.\nWe\u2019ve actually secured presidents who\nwe invite along. We also join up with\nthe girls club and have speeches at the\nend of the year.\nWhere do you see ICSMHC in\nrelation to the other Medic sports\nteams? On both a social and\nsporty side?\nThe best!. We\u2019re doing well actu-ally, we\u2019ve made ourselves much more\nknown in recent times and on the\nsocial side of things we very promi-nent. And we\u2019re pushing on the sports\ndepartment.\nWhy is it that the Medics have\ntwo separate clubs for men and\nwomen as opposed to ICHC\nwhere they are joint? Are there\nany plans in joining them up?\nI don\u2019t actually know why that is but\nwe do have a close relationship with\nthe girls team. They come with us to\nOxford. But I guess one of the benefits\nis that if you\u2019re going for a night out, as\nenjoyable as it is to have girls there, you\ndon\u2019t necessarily need them to go out\ndrinking (Ed - Controversial!). I think\nwe have a close enough relationship\nwith the girls team that I don\u2019t think\nthere\u2019s any need for us to join together\ninto one club no.\nIn felix recently there was a debate on sporting excellence and\ninclusion. What are your opin-ions? Should College concentrate\non being the best at sport or on\nbeing as inclusive as they can?\nAsk the captain -Ben Saunders\nI think it is really important to be really inclusive actually. It is always good\nto promote Imperial as a team going\nout no matter who you are - IC, ICSM\nor RSM. Having such teams will only\npromote Imperial and I think realistically if you are going to go for pure\nsporting excellence then you need to\ncombine ICSM and IC. But I don\u2019t\nthink that is necessarily the way for-ward. Because as much as you would\nget a super team you would have a lot\nmore people left out and you couldn\u2019t\nhave six hockey teams going out every\nweek I wouldn\u2019t have thought. It would\nmake Varsity less special if we were\ncombined.\nBetween IC and the Medical\nBen, a former ICSM rower, has been in the 1st team\nsince his second year when he decided that rowing in a\nboat along a river in the early morning didn\u2019t satisfy him\nsufficiently .

We knew that the Red Hawks were\nunbeaten this season and were leading\nour Division by two points. We knew\nthe game would be a tough one, with\nsome of us still remembering our only\nother trip to Cardiff- a physical encounter that we lost by an impressive\n24-0 score line.\nDespite a long trip that saw us arrive\nlate and having to get straight on the\nice Imperial started strong. We spent\nlong periods in the Cardiff zone- pulling off cycling moves that would have\nbought a tear to the eye of Vince. However we failed to create many scoring\nchances until Freddie fed Virya on the\nblue line with a cross ice pass from\nthe behind the goal where Virya unleashed a great slapshot which passed\nthe helpless Cardiff goalie. We took\nthis lead to the first intermission with\nmixed feelings- we were playing some\nof our best hockey of the season and\nkeeping Cardiff caged back but were\nstill just the one goal to the good.\nThe second period started well with\nFreddie picking up a superb goal of his\nown to settle Imperial nerves, however on the very next shift a drop in\nconcentration saw Cardiff pull back\nwithin one with a simple rebound after\nRuth made the initial save. Cardiff had\nobviously not been happy with their\nperformance and decided to try and\nplay a more physical game in this pe-riod. However this soon turned against\nthem when they quickly racked up\nthe penalties. Imperial knew they had\nto utilize these opportunities, particularly with two long 5 on 3 advantages,\nbut the pressure was too much. Simple\npasses weren\u2019t being made and plays\nwere easily broken down. The best\nchance fell to Freddie on a breakaway,\nbut his early shot came off the inside\nof the post.\nCardiff had worked hard to kill the\npenalties and were back at full strength\nbut shot themselves in the foot when\nsome confusion behind the net saw the\npuck fall to Chris Pinnick in front of\nthe goal who took his time and made\nno mistake to score his first goal to\nmake it 3-1 to Imperial.\nMany of the team thought this was\nthe bit of luck we needed but it was\nnot to be. Cardiff soon had their first\npowerplay of the game and scored\nquickly to stay within touching dis-tance. This seemed to bring Cardiff,\nand the small crowd, to life and the rest\nof the period saw Imperial come under\nintense pressure that saw Cardiff draw\nlevel on a shot through traffic.\nThe second intermission could not\ncome soon enough for Imperial that\nfaced a stark choice: play like we did\nin the first period and go home with\nthe win or play as we did in the second\nand face the remarkably foggy roads of\nCardiff pointless.\nWe made the first choice and came\nout playing hard, keeping the pressure\non Cardiff and reducing them to long\nshots from the point. The home crowd\nwere finally silenced when Freddie\ndeked the goalie out of his pants and\nrolled the puck into the net. He then\ncompleted his hat-trick and a four-point debut with a beautiful finish in\noff the bar under heavy pressure. Despite the two goal lead we knew that\nCardiff had the potential to get back\ninto it and we had to play strong until\nthe final whistle.\nThe team played some great posses-sionalhockeyintheoppositionendthat\nsaw the time fall away. Cardiff managed a few decent chances but Ruth\nand the defence held strong. With less\nthan two minutes on the clock and a\nface-off in our end, Cardiff pulled the\ngoalie but after a couple of attempts\nImperial killed the game off with Tom\nscoring the empty-netter to make the\nfinal score a convincing 6-3.\nWhile this was performance was cer-tainlynotperfect,itwasagreatteamef-fort after a long road trip, with every\nplayer really digging deep. Ruth once\nagain earned (wo)man-of-the-match,\nafter making 33 out of 36 saves despite\ncarrying an injury.\nThis was the last game of an excellent term for the Imperial Devils who\nhave now played each team once (with\nthree of these four games played away).\nWe finished with a 3-1 record that sees\nus heading Division 2, ahead of Cardiff\non goal difference by virtue of Tom\u2019s\nempty-netter. Hopefully we can continue this form into 2009, a year that\nwill also see us entering a Division 3\nteam for the first time!\nA couple of ice hockey reports to digest\nIce Hockey\nImperial Devils A 6\nCardiff Red Hawks 3\nChris Beardsell\nIce Hockey\nImperial Devils B 6\nStreatham Night Wolves 11\nPaul Gilmartin\nnomenon unknown to them this sea-son, and concede again. However, they\ncontinued to go for it and had chances\nto win the game, with the Lapin going\nclose from a corner and Marvin\u2019s set\npieces causing problems.\nThe game ended 2-2 with the 4s by\nfar the happier team and both squads\nroll into 2009 looking to build on a\nmixed start to the season.\nCredit must go also to the subs -Tom, Jose and Raam seeing that the\n5s were amply supported throughout,\neven though they were denied a run-out.\nULUs flagship teams battle it out...\nContinued from back page\nAfter the success of the A team earlier in the week the B team set off to\nwhat was for many their very first ice\nhockey match with hopes high. While\nonly a friendly match, the game would\nprovide a great indicator of what to expect from the team for their upcoming\nseason. As soon as we saw the Night\nWolves on the ice we knew this game\nwould be much tougher than anticipated with many large players with known\nexperience and other players displaying good skating ability.\nAfter a short and somewhat disorganised warm-up the game got underway and proceeded to provide the\ncrowd with plenty of action as one of\nthe worst starts to a hockey match in\nhistory took place. 2 and a half minutes of running clock time gave Imperial a modest 4-0 deficit courtesy of\nsome skilled solo efforts by the Night\nWolves, some weak defending and an\ninadequate warm up for our goalie.\nThis could also be put down to a certain amount of intimidation felt by\nsome of our players in their first competitive experience. Once some of the\nmore experienced players gained some\ncomposure Imperial started to give a\nmuch better display, involving some\ngood passing and getting the puck in\ntheir end. Despite a lack of clear cut\nchances this was a great improvement\non the opening few minutes. Some\nsolid defending and great saves by Richard meant we only conceded 1 more\ngoal before the end of the period.\nThe team came off for the break\nwith much more confidence and it began to feel like we may be able to save\nsome pride from the game with a solid\nperformance required in the second\nperiod. Unfortunately an early lapse\nin concentration meant they scored\nquickly from the face off and this period looked to be going the same way\nas the previous.\nHowever nothing could prepare the\nscreaming crowd for the slick, smooth\nandaccomplisheddisplayofhockeyIm-perial showed after this. Many chances\nwent begging in front of goal until a\nmove involving most of the team falling over at some point led to Ales passing the puck from behind their goal, a\ncheeky flick from Sophie\u2019s skate saw it\nland on Punil\u2019s stick and he punished\nthe defence for leaving him open by\nslotting it low into the far corner. Filled\nwith confidence the whole team pulled\ntogether and created chance after\nchance but it fell to Rich B. to punish\nthe Night Wolves with a superb solo\neffort, darting from our end, through\ntheir defence and finishing high in the\ncorner past a bewildered goalie. The\ngame had really started to get going\nbut the Night wolves managed to get\none back in the last 20 seconds to finish off the period all square with the\nmatch at 6-2.\nAnticipation was high for what we\ncould achieve from the third period\nwith us getting better the longer the\ngame went on. Night Wolves scored\nanother after a few minutes with a\nrebound from some good saves from\nRichard. Next it was the turn of another defender to get on the Imperial\nscore sheet as Andres took advantage\nof a poor line change by the opposition\nto storm up the ice with great intent\nand only the goal on his mind, showing great composure to deke the goalie\nand finish smoothly for another Imperial goal. In the next quarter of an hour\nit was clear both teams were starting\nto tire, with them scoring 2 more but\na scramble in their zone dropped the\npuck onto James Freedman\u2019s stick and\nhe put another one in the net for Imperial. Then in the last few minutes they\nscored again, but not long after Chris\nPinnick got hold of the puck hunting\nfor the goal he seemed to have been\nchasing all game after his success with\nthe A team. Getting into their zone he\nlooked threatening but made the smart\npass to Toby only to receive it back in\na great position and didn\u2019t need a second chance to fire it home with a great\nshot.\nThe final score was 11-6 but this\nscore line did not reflect the way Imperial had got themselves into the game\nand begun to dominate a vastly more\nexperienced team. Man of the match\nwent to Richard for keeping us in the\ngame on many occasions with some\ngreat goaltending in his first match,\ncredit also goes to the defenders who\ndid a superb job of keeping them at bay\nbut it was a team effort and everyone\nrose to the occasion showing great\npromise for the new season starting\nthis term.\nSchool there is always a divide\nbetween them. Rugby and netball\nare better on the Medics side, yet\nwhy is it not the same for hockey\nand football?\nI don\u2019t know actually. Football and\nhockey are quite similar games in\na way apart from the size of the ball.\nThe running lines and how the play\ngoes are very similar. It might be due\nto the wide selection choice available at\nImperial. I believe it is a big thing that\nwhen you come to the medical school\nand you play rugby they do look out for\nyou.\nIt is not particularly known for hockey and football and I guess because\nthere is a smaller spread of people we\ndon\u2019t get such a range.\nBen Saunders is definitely in this picture.\nICUAFC 4th XI.

A decent-looking guy\nwith a no-brand sweat-shirt and\nno-brand sneakers. We could say he\nwas normal. He even looked young,\nno more than 30. As I went past him,\nI didn\u2019t even turn back or act suprised\nsince this was no surprise to me at all.\nI realised that I had seen lonely slow-walking normal-looking alone-talking\npeople almost everyday during this\npast week. I couldn\u2019t help but wonder:\nare we all freaks or is there something\nto freak about?\nWe all know that the world is currently in a difficult financial position,\nwe all know that the climate change is\nspeeding up the end of our dear planet,\nbut are these the reasons for the high\nlevel of freaks I encountered this week?\nY\nou understand, I am only\nhuman. And humans cannot resist a little bargain.\nMy dollar-sign eyes glisten as this appears on my\ncomputer screen - \u201cyour flight status is\nconfirmed\u201d. I punch my fists in the air\nand swing my t-shirt above my head.\nHa, a \u00a340 return flight to Milan.\nBlood drains from my face when\nthe adrenalin of slashing a good deal\nebbs away. I realise what I have done.\nYet again. 100 years on from Jack and\nRose, technological advances have put\nan end to epic travelling. Unfortunately not with a budget airline. They send\nyou 3 centuries back to the Z-deck on\na transatlantic steamboat. On the eve\nof departure, I toss and turn in my\nbed, soak my linen with cold sweat as\nMichael O\u2019Leary opens my suitcase\nand toss my shower gel, t-shirts, tow-els, nighties, underpants, sunglasses,\nflip-flops and bikini into an open fire.\n\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you pay for checked lug-gage? Why didn\u2019t you pay for speedy\nboarding? Why didn\u2019t you\u2026\u201d. He puts\na numbered stamp on my forehead\nand a fearsome looking witch pushes\nme onto the aircraft. I have never been\nmore cheerful to wake up to a 4am\nalarm clock. What a nightmare. Wait,\nor is it the actualisation of truth?\nWhy am I such a fool? Knowing full\nwell in advance that ground travel will\nprobably cost me an extra \u00a340 if not\nmore. Yes, booking with BA will cost\nme \u00a3100 one off. But I will fly out at\nmore humane hours, and I can march\non to the aircraft with dignity. The\nairhostess to welcome you on board\nat least has the decency to tie up their\nhair and look presentable. I get to\nbooze on the house, I get to have a little sandwich, I get a few glittery points\non my AirMiles portfolio. And if I am\nthick enough I can even ask for toys or\nregister myself as an \u201cunaccompanied\nminor\u201d and suckle on the stewardess\u2019s\nbreast.\nBut the damage has been done, I have\nto physically trawl my 0kg bag through\nthe door to catch the next tube, bus,\ntrain, coach, plane, coach again and\nthen bus. I always, always angrily\npunch the passenger seat in front of\nme just to vent my frustration on how\nimpossible I am. How many mistakes\ndo I need to make before I ban myself\nfrom the Ryanair website? I lie on my\nhotel bed in Citta Alta thinking about\nBush. \u201cFool me once, shame on\u2026\u201d. I am\ntoo exhausted to admire the scenery\noutside my hotel window. I have wasted another \u00a340 for sleeping through\nthe day in a hotel room.\nI am no business person. But I happen to know that in 2006, Ryanair\nlaunched a hostile take over for Aerlingus. Aerlingus had a close shave\nthen, the decision rejected only by\nEuropean Commission reasoning that\nRyanair will attain Irish air monopoly.\nThe Irish Government dumped three\nquarters of the previously government owned company\u2019s shares onto\nthe stock market in 2006. Since then\nRyanair has become the largest shareholder of Aerlingus at 29.5%. Allow\nme to reiterate my sheer ignorance in\nhow the financial market works, but it\nwould be an utter nightmare for passengers if the budget airline ideology\ncontinue to dominate our air traffic. I\nprefer to check in how ever many bags\nas I see fit, without a hush-puppy looking clerk pulling another \u00a320 off my\nplastic. I prefer the lovely snacks and\ndrinks and toys. I prefer the \u2018Catch Me\nIf You Can\u2019 airhostesses. I prefer to pay\nfor a ticket with an honest price tag\nwith no hidden costs.\nAnd for you stripey suit wearing kids\nout there jumping up and down in protest to what I have said above, yes, I\nacknowledge the fact that Ryanair has\nits beautiful side too. Ryanair has created tourist destinations in rural parts\nof Europe that no one has envisioned\nany form of business would be able to\nflourish at all. But stripey suit wearing\nkids probably never have to travel in\nEconomy Class, let alone with a budget\nairline. You don\u2019t understand us commoner\u2019s pain if Ryanair manages to eat\nits way up the food chain and degrade\nthe service our sons of the world so\nrightly deserve.\nAerlingus is no Alitalia. It continues\nto trade favourably on the stock mar-ket. I fail to see why it needs a blue\nand yellow smiley with two devil horns\nstuck up their rear exit.\nA\npretty ubiquitous thing,\nthe wall. Surrounded by\nthem for most of our daily lives, whether walking\ndown wall-lined streets\nor sitting in the enclosure of them, how\nmany of us consider the significance\nof walls on our well-being, psyche, or\neven world history? With great walls,\nwailing walls, and wonderwalls; there\nmust be more to them than first meets\nthe eye.\nPaleolithic man rebelled against nature by constructing walls where he\nwanted to stay; one of his first technological advances. From the days of\nhigh-tech protection measures, walls\nhave evolved to now have many rai-sons d\u2019\u00eatre: surprising maybe, but\nconsider\u2026\nThe most prominent of modern day\nare those around territories, a mark\nof ownership on the land. A really\nbig barrier keeping out the undesirables and protecting those within. Like\nyour neighbour growing big pine trees\naround their garden to stop you from\npeeking in, it says a lot.\nStay with me now \u2013 there\u2019s a point.\nLike children in an argument that find\nWonder walls \u2013 more than just a catchy\ntune for Quick Nic\nthey\u2019re getting nowhere turning their\nbacks to each other, walls in difficult\nsituations rarely solve a lot. My example being the days I\u2019ve gone not talking\nto my sister. With closed doors there\u2019s\nno need for communication; therefore\nit doesn\u2019t happen. We\u2019ve lost our communities for the same reason and have\nreplaced them with virtual ones where\nease of communication is the name of\nthe game. I personally like to hear the\nlol, see the :@ and feel the (}), it lets me\nfeel real, un-virtual if you will. Walls\nare letting us live our separate lives\nwithout any need for real face to face\ninteraction.\nWithout this communication nothing gets solved; because unlike children\nforgetting the stolen Pok\u00e9mon card;\nwhole populations rarely forget their\nproblems and it\u2019s even harder to attain the forgiveness of those wronged.\nWalling the problem up as Emperor\nAkbar did to legendary dancer Anarkali (Mughal-E-Azam, a must-watch\nHindi film) only serves to exacerbate\nthe problem, creating the ideal breeding ground for extreme feelings to take\nhold. Who knows what could happen\nthen?\nImagine around you, the walls crumbling down. Your magnolia stained,\nflower printed bedrooms disintegrat-ing. The faces of your favourite girls\nand boys (or your revision notes as the\ncase may be) crumpling. You may get\ncaught in the debris of what was once\nyour home. The cold streaming in, taking hold. Nowhere to sleep and escape\nthe harshness that our ancestors long\nago faced. As the adage goes, you don\u2019t\nknow what you\u2019ve got till it\u2019s gone.\nI\u2019m saying this so that I\u2019m not too\nharsh to walls. Perhaps it\u2019s not walls\nthat are to blame, but people. When\nthe giants fight it\u2019s the civilians who\nlose what\u2019s dearest to them. Walls may\nhave evolved but only as mankind has\ndictated; whether to impose themselves or for the safety and warmth of\nour homes. Some walls are worth fighting for; God knows I love mine.\nThe writing on the wall doesn\u2019t have\nto be so ominous. We should appreciate our homes and good lives; realise that everyone has the right to live\nfree of fear, to have a roof over their\nheads and walls to love, not hate. Well\ndone then to the group of people who\nran the peace wall, \u201cPeace by pieces\u201d,\nwhere people could express their feelings on the recent tragedies and others could be made aware, then go on to\ndo something about it. Rather cleverly\nthese people chose to use their wall as\na means of breaking down the ones\nin our minds. It was very successful\nand hopefully has driven the students\nto stand and say we at Imperial want\nnothing but peace.\nOur first show of solidarity will be\ntonight on Queen\u2019s Lawn where there\nwill be a Vigil from 5 till 6.\nMaybe being another brick in the\nwall isn\u2019t so bad after all.\nDoes the political and social situation\nof a country reflect on the amount of\nfreaks running free on the streets? In\norder to find an answer I had to look\nfor examples extracted from my life.\nBack home, I used to have a neighbour,\na good-looking 30-something woman\nwith child, who used to get drunk and\nstart singing songs in an unknown language in her garden until late at night.\nThen one of my English teachers at\nschool had such sudden mood changes\nthat some days she would praise you\nas her best pupil and other days she\nwould forget your name in the middle\nof the year. And these were only a few\nexamples from my past. The fact that\nthey happened when everything was\npeaceful and not altered by any credit\ncrunch means that there might not be\na close relation to the stability status\nof the world and the number of crazy\npeople out there.\nI decided to investigate my present\nand see if I could see a difference. Unfortunately, I have to say that it has\ngotten even worse. I have met some\nserious freaks at Imperial during my 3\nyears here. Even though I have to admit that most of them are harmless,\nit makes me very sad when I discover\na freak among the people I call my\nfriends. There was a person whom I\nconsidered a close friend last year and\nwho suddenly stopped talking to me.\nAt this point I obviously didn\u2019t know\nabout her freak identity, I thought that\nsomething had happened or that I had\nmade some mistake. But later on, some\npeople told me that she had stopped\ntalking to them too. And then I discovered that half Imperial had been\nrejected by her. I instantenously felt a\nfeeling of relief \u201cit\u2019s not me!\u201c but then\nmany new questions came to my mind.\nHow do you handle such mood-swing-ing freaks? Can they be friends with\nnormal people?\nIn order to find answers, I went and\ndid some research in the literature.\nFor those who watch Friends, you will\nimmediately think of Phoebe. Yes, she\nwould come into the harmless freak\ncategory, but she is also a funny, creative and very caring person. And thus\nshe had friends. In \u2018Friends\u2019 I trust and\nthus I decided to fight for those freaks\nwho might come up a bit strong the\nfirst day but then have lovely person-alities. Being freak doesn\u2019t have to play\nagainst you, it can also be a charming\nasset you can use, and create some kind\nof lovely unpredictability around you.\nUnfortunately this is not always the\ncase. It is not even usually the case. But\nit happens, and you have to give people\na chance. And besides, the amount of\nfreaks having gone up at the same time\nthat the credit crunch has been introduced into our lives, who is to say that\nthese are not directly correlated? It is\npossible that it is not even their fault\nif they have been infected by this crazy\nvirus, it is clearly the subprimes\u2019!\nAre we all freaks or is there something to\nfreak about? - Slutty Pumpkin\n\u201cHow many\nmistakes do I\nneed to make\nbefore I ban\nmyself from\nthe Ryanair\nwebsite?\u201d\nKawai Wong: Ryanair, fool\nme once, shame on...\nscience.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nScience\nScience Editors \u2013 Daniel Burrows & Mi\u0107o Tatalovi\u0107\nIdle computer power can now be put\nto good use, thanks to a novel scheme\nset up by scientists at Harvard University investigating new solar-panel\ntechnology.\nWilling volunteers can download a\nsimple program to their PC or Mac,\nso during screen-saver mode it runs\ncalculations used for research into organic solar cells. Some of the energy\notherwise wasted in the home can actually contribute towards developing\nrenewable energy sources.\nThe Clean Energy Project went live\non 5th December 2008, and is part\nof IBM\u2019s World Community Grid\n(WCG), which aims to \u2018advance research of humanitarian projects\u2019. Other\nWCG projects include aids and cancer\nresearch and disease-resistant crop de-velopment. So far the grid has attracted over a million volunteers, notching\nup an estimated 203,000 years of otherwise unused computing time. IBM\nranks the grid in the top 5 supercomputers in the world.\nOrganic solar cells are a lighter and\nmore flexible alternative to conventional silicon cells.

Bush, who has\nbeen accused of allowing U.S research\nto stagnate and of stubbornly ignoring\nthe evidence on climate change.\nAnnouncing his choices in a radio\naddress, Obama said, \u201cIt is time we\nonce again put science at the top of our\nagenda and worked to restore America\u2019s place as the world leader in science\nand technology\u201d.\nThe incoming president also stressed\nthe importance of respecting scientific\nevidence in the process of making\npolitical decisions. \u201cThe truth is that\npromoting science isn\u2019t just about providing resources \u2013 it\u2019s about protecting free and open inquiry. It\u2019s about\nensuring that facts and evidence are\nnever twisted or obscured by politics\nor ideology. It\u2019s about listening to what\nour scientists have to say, even when\nit\u2019s inconvenient \u2013 especially when it\u2019s\ninconvenient. Because the highest purpose of science is the search for knowl-edge, truth and a greater understanding of the world around us. That will\nbe my goal as President of the United\nStates\u201d.\nChief among Obama\u2019s appointments\nwas the selection of Harvard physicist John Holdren as Assistant to the\nPresident for Science and Technology\nand Director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy.\nHoldren is a world-renowned expert\non climate change who has been an\noutspoken proponent of the need to\ntake action. In an article for Scientific\nAmerican last October, Holdren wrote\n\u201cthe Bush administration has wasted\nthe last eight years. It should have been\ntaking decisive action but engaged instead in systematic understatement\nof the danger: it has made ridiculous\nassertions that the U.S should not do\nanything that China does not agree to\ndo and has stubbornly insisted that no\naction should be taken to improve climate change \u2018if it hurts the economy\u2019.\u201d\nFor his lobbying work on environmental issues, Holdren was awarded the\nTyler Prize in Environmental Achievement in 2000.\nIn addition to his work on climate\nchange, Prof. Holdren has also taken a\nkeen interest in science policy, as well\nas being an active opponent of nuclear\nproliferation. In 1995, he accepted the\nNobel Peace Prize on behalf of the\nPugwash Conferences, an organisation\nthat brings together influential scholars with the aim of reducing the danger\nof armed conflict.\nAlong with two other distinguished\nscientists, Harold Varmus and Eric\nLander, Holdren will co-chair the President\u2019s Council of Advisors on Science\nand Technology (PCAST). Varmus received the Nobel Prize for Medicine in\n1989 for his work in cancer research\nand has also served as Director of the\nNational Institutes of Health (NIH).\nLander, a professor of biology who was\ninvolved with the Human Genome\nProject, is the Director of the Broad\nInstitute, a centre for genome research\nset up as a joint venture between Harvard University and the Massachusetts\nInstitute of Technology (MIT).\nAs his Energy Secretary, Obama\nhas chosen another Nobel laureate,\nStephen Chu. Chu, Professor of physics and molecular and cell biology at\nthe University of California, Berkeley\n(UCB), is Director of the Lawrence\nBerkeley National Laboratory. He has\nbeen an outspoken advocate for finding scientific solutions to tackle climate change and has enthusiastically\nsupported research into alternative\nfuels. It is the first time that a career\nscientist has been selected to run the\nDepartment of Energy.\n\u201cPresident\u00ad\n\u2013elect Obama has set the\ntone and pace for moving our country forward with optimism and calm\ndetermination,\u201d Chu said. \u201cWith these\nvirtues, the United States and the\nworld can and will prevail over our\neconomic, energy and climate change\nchallenges.\u201d\nIn addition, Obama has created the\nnew position of Assistant to the President for Energy and Climate Change, a\npost in which he has appointed Carol\nBrowner, a former Administrator of\nthe Environmental Protection Agency\nwho has also served as Al Gore\u2019s Legislative Director. Meanwhile, environmental scientist Jane Lubchenco\nwill take control of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\n(NOAA). In the past, Lubchenco has\nopenly criticised the NOAA for not\ndoing enough to prevent over-fishing.\nMembers of the science community\nwere quick to welcome Obama\u2019s choic-es. \u201cJohn Holdren, Jane Lubchenco and\nSteven Chu are, by any measure, a science dream team for the new administration,\u201d said Peter Frumhoff from the\nlobby group Union of Concerned Scientists. \u201cThey all are among the top in\ntheir fields and understand the critical\nrole that science must play in informing policy decisions.\u201d\nOthers are eager to ensure that\nObama backs up his talk of action on\nclimate change with policies that will\ngenuinely lead to significant reductions in America\u2019s carbon emissions.\nJames Hansen, a climatologist who\nheads NASA\u2019s Goddard Institute for\nSpace Studies, has written an open\nletter to the President and First Lady\noutlining proposals that he believes are\nnecessary to bring down atmospheric\ncarbon dioxide levels. Hansen insists\nthat \u201ccap and trade\u201d measures are insufficient and that much tougher action must be taken. He recommends\nphasing out coal power stations that do\nnot have carbon capture and imposing\na carbon tax at the source of the fuel\nto reduce demand. In addition, he argues that the President must support\nthe development of safe nuclear power\nplants.\nThe letter can be read in full on the\nwebsite of Columbia University, where\nHansen is a Professor of Earth and\nEnvironmental Studies. Prefacing the\nletter, Hansen wrote \u201c(Michelle and\nBarack Obama) are equally smart lawyers and if we can get either of them\nto really focus on the actions that are\nneeded, the planet has a chance\u201d.\nSam Wong\nThe 44th President of the USA, Barack Obama\nI, science\nOUT NEXT WEEK\n\n"

Nothing\nbeats singing in a Geordie accent, except perhaps several Geordie accents\nsinging harmonies on top of layered\nguitar riffs and drumming that never\nsits still. Take all that, blend thoroughly and cram it in your ears at 600mph\nand you\u2019ve got the recipe for the rump\nsteak of live music. But forget 28 days\nmatured, I\u2019d been waiting 4 years to\nsink my teeth into these sumptuous,\nSunderland song-smiths.\nThe Futureheads\u2019 frontman Barry Hyde performing live at the Astoria\nAlistair Garner\nTheir name has an uncertain pronunciation but on the 27th of November,\nMGMT (debate rages between myself and Arts Editor David Paw about\nwhether you say \u2018M.G.M.T\u2019 or Management) delivered a flawless set to an\nuncommonly civilized crowd.\nTheir warm-up act \u2018Strangers\u2019 failed\nto do anything of the sort at the Kentish Town Forum. Their generic and unimaginative beat-driven rock was out\nof touch with the electronic sounds of\nMGMT and the boredom on the faces\nof skinny-jean wearing fashion students was painfully apparent. The lead\nguitarist couldn\u2019t even destroy his guitar properly, opting instead to rip off a\nfew strings and then throttle/rape it.\nAudible sighs rippled throughout the\nvenue when they finally finished their\nset and MGMT\u2019s stage props were un-veiled. A surreal landscape of cacti,\nspiky grass and black and white stripes,\nwhich was complemented by MGMT\nwho were dressed as Native Americans\n(except for the lead singer Ben Goldwasser who was dressed as a Pilgrim)\nin celebration of Thanksgiving).\nHits like \u201cTime to Pretend\u201d, \u201cElectric Feel\u201d and \u201cPieces of What\u201d were\nspaced throughout the set, forcing a\nmostly clueless audience to listen to\ntheir more musically interesting songs.\n\u201cWeekend Wars\u201d was an electronic joy\nwhile even though those who had never heard \u201cThe Youth\u201d before received\nits inhibition-destroying message loud\nand clear and spontaneously started\nhugging their friends.\nNeedless to say, \u2018Time to Pretend\u2019\nwent down well. By the look of their\nfrantic jumping, they couldn\u2019t express\ntheir excitement in an appropriately\nintense fashion. Multiply that feeling\nby 100 and you will get some idea of the\natmosphere in the venue when MGMT\nfinished their set with \u2018Kids\u2019.\nWith all their most popular songs\nused up, it wasn\u2019t immediately obvious what they would play as an encore.\nForget their mainstream \u2018indie\u2019 hits,\nMGMT used the encore to indulge in\nback to basics synth rock. For over 15\nminutes they consumed themselves in\nthe music and for the same 15 minutes\nalmost nobody in the audience had\na clue what was going on. Cue fresh-faced indie kids with their frowns con-veying, \u201cI thought they were going to\nplay \u201cKids\u201d again\u201d.\nSoon after Andrew Van Wyngarden\n(the second member of MGMT) fell\nonto his knees in front of his synth the\ngig ended. MGMT are unlikely to become infamous for their live sets but\nKadhim Shubber\nMGMT is in Control\nthey showed that they are a live band\nthat demands respect for both sheer\ndelivery and the courage to throw a\nmiddle finger to their fans and return\nto their synth roots.\nIt\u2019s a mystery to me as to why Asobi\nSeksu remain fairly unknown. True,\ntheir debut didn\u2019t really deserve a second glance, but their second album\n\u2018Citrus\u2019 was a hyper-melodic explosion\nof colourful dream-pop that went way\nbeyond my expectations to become\none of my favourite albums released\nin 2007. From what they demonstrated in Hoxton\u2019s Bar & Kitchen, it turns\nout that they also put on one helluva\nshow.\nFirst up on the night (and to somewhat balance an otherwise gushy re-view), were Manhattan Love Suicides\nwho aren\u2019t actually from Manhattan\nand are instead from Leeds, but what-ever. Theirs was a loud and relentless\nset, a continuous barrage of inconsiderately bland shoegaze rock that wouldn\u2019t\nbreak between songs. If that was done\nto make their time on stage shorter,\nthen it still went on for too long. Or\nat least it felt that way and it wasn\u2019t\nhelped by the lead singer\u2019s seemingly\ncontemptuous attitude towards the au-dience. Not once acknowledging that\nthere were people standing before her,\nshe spent the entire gig singing with\na bored expression, either staring at a\ncorner of the ceiling or with her back\nto us. Maybe it was supposed to give\nthe impression of cool nonchalance, it\ninstead made the band look arrogant\nand it smacked of the worst kind of\nphoney, indie-posturing.\nBut anyway, we weren\u2019t here for them,\nand like those Egg credit card adverts,\nAsobi Seksu were soon on stage to restore the natural order of the universe.\nWith sets of fairy lights sitting on top\nof amplifiers and wrapped around\nmics, their stage hasn\u2019t changed since\nthey last headlined ULU back in February. What has changed, however, is\ntheir set and by wisely excising nearly\nevery song from their dreary debut, the\nband were able to focus more on the\nsongs dependent on that little gizmo\nsynonymous with the shoegaze and\ndream-pop genres: the effects peddle.\nTonnes of delay effects were served\nupon extravagant helpings of reverb\nthreatening to push nearly all other\nelements of the band\u2019s performance\naside. James Hanna tore, plucked and\nscratched at his guitar strings until a\nhuge fuck-off torrent of guitar fuzz\n(usually accompanied by blasts of\nstrobe lighting), had filled every corner\nof the tiny venue. It added impressive\nvolume and muscularity to songs like\n\u2018New Years\u2019 and the epic \u2018Thursday\u2019,\nbut the other three band members fleshed out all the subtleties and nuances.\nYuki Chikudate stood front and centre\non vocals and despite having Hanna\nspinning about next to her (as well as\nbeing small enough to fit in your pock-et), she managed to remain the centre\nof attention as she thrashed about on\nher synths. Though her vocals may be\nslightly too thin to be angelic, they\u2019re\nsweet enough and singing in Japanese,\nshe virtually took off on the soaring\nchorus of \u2018Strings\u2019.\nJorge Costa\nMGMT is pronounced \u201cmuh-guh-mut-tuh\u201d, the french word for \u2018music\u2019\nFilling the slots that those first album\ntracks left vacant were previews from\ntheir upcoming release, \u2018Hush\u2019. Unlike\nthe sonically dense \u2018Citrus\u2019, these new\nsongs sound more spacious, with Hanna\u2019s guitar effects scaled back to instead\nfavour the drum beats and Chikudate\u2019s\nvocals. Catchy and retaining \u2018Citrus\u2019s\nenergy, they\u2019re a good indicator of\nwhat\u2019s to come when that album is\nreleased in February \u201909. But before\nwe could start missing the effects, the\nband finished off their main set with\nthe double-whammy of \u2018Strawberries\u2019\nand \u2018Red Sea\u2019, the latter\u2019s roaring five\nminute climax seeing Chikudate uprooting her drummer and thrashing\nabout until she looked like she could\nno longer lift the drumsticks.\nLeaving the strobes and fuzz on, the\nband eventually came back for a two\nsong encore which including their debut\u2019s best song, the bouncy \u2018I\u2019m Happy,\nBut You Don\u2019t Like Me\u2019. Don\u2019t worry\nAsobi Seksu, we like you. We like you\na lot.\n\u201cJames Hanna\ntore, plucked\nand scratched at\nhis guitar strings\nuntil a fuck-off\ntorrent of guitar\nfuzz had filled\nevery corner of\nthe tiny venue\u201d\nI arrived at the venue with an unhealthy appetite for northern post-punk, but before that came the first\ncourse. We were served the familiar\nflavours (to my palate anyway) of\nclassic Midlands-core, in the form of\nBirmingham-based three piece Johnny\nForeigner. Their super-fast, overdriven\nchords and the constant exchange of\nsoft crooning for incomprehensible\nscreaming by both male and female\nvocalists was unmistakably reminiscent of the sound of bands like One\nToy Soldier and TANAOU from my\nhome town (Northampton), and I\u2019m\nsure of hundreds of bands playing in\nthe back rooms of pubs from Gloucester to Great Yarmouth. All credit to\nJohnny Foreigner for landing a spot on\ntour with the Futureheads though, and\nthey certainly earned their place at this\nshow with an enjoyable, snappy set that\nhad their fans going crazy at the front,\nand made every audience member at\nthe very least tap their feet.\nWhilst their songs were fun to listen\nto, punchy and fast-paced, the music\nitself was largely forgettable, the band\nrelying on lyrical hooks to make their\nsongs catchy, but this was achieved\nwith great success. I found myself singing their songs on the way home after\njust one listen, instead of the Futureheads hits I\u2019d heard hundreds of times.\nJohnny\u2019s lyrics were classic teen po-etry, and the lead vocals of Alexei Berrow were suitably pained to do them\njustice, but he sang with that whiney,\nimplacable accent that seems to afflict\nso many frontmen of bands of this type.\nMaybe they all came from the same\nfar-away planet to sing to the youth\nof Great Britain. But still, you can sing\nhow you like when your bassist looks\nlike she does; you\u2019ll still fill every venue\nwith teenage boys.\nThen came the main event. The Futureheads entered, beaming at their\nriotous reception and set about giving\nthe crowd what they were expecting.\nThey started the set rattling through\nsome of the best tracks from their first\ntwo albums. \u2018Decent Days And Nights\u2019,\n\u2018Robot\u2019 and \u2018Meantime\u2019 from their self-titled debut, and \u2018Skip To The End\u2019\nand \u2018Worry About It Later\u2019 from News\nand Tributes were all massive crowd\npleasers, played with an enthusiasm\nand energy that didn\u2019t diminish for the\nwhole show. It was hugely enjoyable to\nsee four maniacs vigorously thrashing\ntheir respective instruments in their\nindividual areas of the stage, and yet\nto hear the togetherness of four musicians perfectly synchronised, dropping\nin and out seamlessly to create their\nunique, restless sound.\nLater they broke out their most recent singles, \u2018Beginning of the Twist\u2019\nand \u2018Radio Heart\u2019, and some non-al-bum tracks like \u2018Area\u2019, but the crowd\nstill sang every word. The audience\nsoaked up the band\u2019s energy like their\njeans soaked up the spilt beer and\nsweat from the floor, and went absolutely mental on it. Their calf muscles\nwere tested by \u2018First Day\u2019, the band going so fast by the end that the crowd\nbarely had time to touch the floor in\nbetween jumps, but they didn\u2019t reach\na peak until they heard the familiar vocal horseplay of \u2018Hounds of Love\u2019, the\nFutureheads\u2019 biggest single and closing number. Modestly, they hadn\u2019t\nwithheld any of their big hits from\nthe main set, so when they came back\non stage, they played a proper encore\nof new songs and a couple of covers,\nand closed with a massive rendition of\n\u2018Man Ray, strobe lights a plenty.\nThe Futureheads are an accomplished band but they showed us at the\nAstoria that they\u2019re still all about fun.\nThey had fun with the songs, fun with\neach other and fun with the audience,\nand whilst I can\u2019t imagine it was as fun\nfor us as it was for them, I still had a\nbloody good time that was well worth\nthe wait. Delicious.\n\u201cThe audience\nsoaked up the\nband\u2019s energy\nlike their jeans\nsoaked up the\nspilt beer and\nsweat from the\nfloor\u201d\nHaving just crawled back into the\ncountry from ten hellish night shifts in\na bunker at the ESRF in Grenoble, the\nlast thing I wanted to encounter on my\nreturn to civilisation was a French rock\nband. Or a French anything. Or anything that smelt even faintly of cheese.\nThink French music and the first thing\nthat springs to mind is likely to be the\nelectronic weirdness of Air or Daft\nPunk \u2013 neither of which is a bad band,\nbut I thought I was going to a rock gig.\nStill, in One Way Mirror it seems I\u2019d\nstumbled onto something of a gem.\nFormed as the side-project of Soilwork\u2019s drummer, Dirk Verbeuren, who\nheroically drummed straight through\ntwo back-to-back sets, the band gave\none of the tightest sets I\u2019ve seen in\na while, playing an industrial brand\nof dirty heavy metal. Impressively\nthough, especially for a band singing\nin their second language, they never\nstrayed down the path of screaming incoherently and their superb front man,\nGuillaume Bideau, was clearly loving\nthe spotlight. And it\u2019s not every day\nyou get to hear a rock cover of Frankie\nGoes To Hollywood\u2019s \u2018Relax\u2019 sung in\nthe style of James Hetfield.\nAs it turned out, the main event\nwasn\u2019t bad either. Soilwork come\nacross like a more polished, Swedish\nKillswitch Engage (anyone who\u2019s ever\nsat through that celluloid epic, Resident Evil, will know who I mean): a bit\nshoutier than the support act, but better lyrically and with a much stronger\nback-catalogue. Brilliantly, despite the\nband sporting the obligatory long hair,\ntats and black clothing, their shaven-headed vocalist came on wearing a\nstriped shirt and waistcoat, looking\nlike somewhere between Al Murray\nand Buster Bloodvessel. Now there\u2019s\nan analogy that makes me look old...\nSoilwork live\nat Islington\nAcademy\nDuncan Casey\nThe technical skill of the band was\nsomething to be marvelled at: time\nsignatures were chopped and changed\nseamlessly, the guitarists would occasionally swap roles during solos and\nthe drummer still had all his limbs\nfunctioning at the end of the encore,\nwhich was a feat in itself. However,\nthey weren\u2019t helped out much by the\nsound levels \u2013 although One Way Mirror had been crystal clear throughout,\nSoilwork\u2019s sound man clearly decided\nit was much more \u2018rock\u2019 to mash everything up to 11, meaning that the\nguitarists were often inaudible above\nthe drums and vocals and that all too\noften the whole affair descended into\na kind of metal distortion fuzz. Still,\nthey gave a good show and you can\u2019t\nhelp but feel that this band should be\nrocking out 3,000 people at Brixton\nAcademy rather than the paltry 300-odd you can fit into Islington.

We seem to have recruited an\narmy of gastronauts to our cause here\non the food pages. If you fancy writing\nabout a restaurant, or sending in some\nrecipes please get in touch. We love to\nhear from our readers and we won\u2019t eat\nyou if you do get in touch. However I\ndo like offal, so any spare kidneys..?\nBy the way, have you noticed the nice\ndecor at the base of this column? Our\nfriendly neighbourhood burger vendors have offered Imperial\u2019s students a\nwhopping 20% off the bill for the next\nterm! (I can\u2019t believe I just said whop-ping.) Anyway, please take the opportunity to use your student ID. We don\u2019t\nget the opportunity very often!\nFeeb a Colb, Starb a Feber\nsalad, to potted duck and a pint of\nprawns, the starters are varied and en-ticing. But don\u2019t be fooled \u2013 the starter\ncould well be a main course. We went\nfor the \u2018hot buttered Arbroath smokie\u2019and thank god we chose to share. It\u2019s a\nfish you don\u2019t get often, full of flavour,\nand though the melted butter was visibly present it felt amazingly healthy.\nPerhaps it\u2019s worth to note here that\nservice was fabulous, our waitress was\nexceptionally sweet and more than\nwilling to offer her personal prefer-ences. Timing was balanced between\nwaiting a little and arriving before we\nnoticed the absence of plates.\nThe day roasts, fish and chips, and\npork belly are renowned at Canteen,\nbut we ventured for the salt beef with\nvegetables and haddock with spinach\nand mashed potatoes. All delicious,\nbut none of us could finish them- the\nplates were simply too plentiful. The\nquality of their meat, the freshness of\nthe vegetables, meant that no fancy\nsauces were required to enjoy the fla-Canteen HHH\n55 Baker Street, W1U 8EW\n0845 686 1122\nwww.canteen.co.uk\nBest: The tremendous treacle\ntart\nWorst: The mash\nPrice: \u00a320 per head\nvours. However, it is often the simplest\nthings restaurants get wrong. Potatoes are wholesome and easy to cook\nbut somehow the mash didn\u2019t get the\n\u2018yum\u2019 reaction. It was slightly salty and\na bit too mashed if you know what I\nmean- that sort of suspicious synthetic\ntexture you get if it\u2019s perfectly smooth.\nThe sauce came on the side- and left\nwith the plate untouched. The haddock didn\u2019t need it.\nBy the end we were seriously debating about what to choose for dessert.\nGuinness cake, bakewell tart, brownie\nsundae or a Neals Yard cheese platter.\nWith our bellies rumbling, we opted\nfor treacle tart- and never turned back.\nServed with a small dollop of jersey\ncream, it was lemony enough and not\ntoo sweet. Sublime.\nThey say feed a fever, starve a cold.\nI reckon that I had a fever coming \u2013\nbecause, unlike yesterday, I now feel\non top form. Sometimes high quality\ncomfort food does so much more than\nelaborate cuisine.\nL\nike most of us, I\u2019m fighting\noff the coming of a flu, a\ncold, bronchitis, and other\nhorrible winter illnesses. So\nTuesday night, after walking\nin the blistering cold and feeling my\norgans freeze, I wasn\u2019t exactly keen on\ntrekking all the way to Baker Street \u2013\neven if it was for a warm meal. It\u2019s the\nlatest sibling of the original Canteen\nof Southbank. But although it does attempt to keep the simple, clean d\u00e9cor\nand the \u2018chic\u2019 canteen format of the\nfirst \u2013 something is not quite right. It\u2019s\ndifficult to place the finger on what\u2019s\nwrong \u2013 but the lighting could have\nbeen softer, and the counter in the middle seemed a bit distasteful. The idea is\nto display all their delicious treats in it,\nbut as a centre-piece of the restaurant it\ncan be quite off-putting. We reserved,\nbut there was no need to. It was a quiet\nnight, but then again it was a weekday\nand it\u2019s only just opened.\nThe menu is printed on paper table mats, and in a red leather menu a\nvenerable wine list is displayed. Being\nstudents, house red was the pick of\nthe day \u2013 and it beats most expensive\npub bottles. Sinking comfortably into\nour seats, we took a look at the menu.\nAt first glance the list looks so long it\nseems impossible to ensure quality of\nthe dishes \u2013 but many are actually repeated as starters. I urge anyone who\nstill believes England only offers foreign or creative fusion food, to go to\nCanteen ASAP. It goes back to British basics. From mackerel and potato\nSurvive the Winter? I need a Mirepoix\u2026 Onion,\ncarrot and celery, when finely chopped with some\ngarlic and thrown into a hot casserole, already sizzling with slithers of bacon, spluttering away in a\nmixture of butter and their own piggy fat... there\ncan surely be few more salivatory stimuli. Mirepoix\nto the French, Soffrito to Italians, this combination\nof the humblest of veg represents the holy trinity of\nhearty, earthy, warming winter sustenance and onto\nof its sturdy foundations can be crafted some seriously life-affirming monuments to deliciousness.\nFrom slow-cooked meaty stews, to stocks, soups\nand sauces, the possibilities are as varied as they\nare tasty. The recipe below is but a simple yet unbelievably effective example of what you can do\nrelatively cheaply. However, when you find yourself\ndeep in the throes of Seasonal Affective Disorder,\nand are in serious need of some new year cheer,\nthen fewer things could seem more valuable.\nServes 4\n3 fat cloves of garlic, finely chopped\n1 Onion, finely chopped\n2 carrots halved lengthways and sliced\n2-3 sticks celery, finely chopped\n1 leek halved lengthways and sliced\n1 potato peeled and cut into 2-3cm cubes (soak in\ncold water for 5 mins before cooking and drain.\nThis stops the soup from being too starchy).\nFresh Herbs \u2013 good sprig of rosemary, 2/3 sprigs\nthyme, handful chopped sage leaves, 2-3 bay\nleaves\n2 tbs olive oil plus a good knob of butter\nGlass of red wine\n1.5 litres vegetable stock (cubes are fine)\n1 x 400g can of borlotti beans, drained and rinsed\nA good handful of fusilli pasta (or macaroni, bits of\nbroken spaghetti or other small pasta)\nMirepoix\n5-6 good handfuls of chopped kale (or you could\nuse chopped cabbage, chard or covollo nero. You\ncould also chuck in a few handfuls of spinach too)\nLots of freshly grated parmesan cheese\nSalt and freshly ground black pepper plus extra virgin olive oil for drizzling\nHeat the oil and butter in a large deep frying pan over\na medium \u2013 high heat and add the chopped bacon.\nStir occasionally making sure it doesn\u2019t stick.\nWhen the bacon starts to crisp up and the fat has developed a nice golden hue, add all the chopped veg\nand the herbs. Stir occasionally to prevent sticking\nand to ensure even cooking. Season with a little salt\nand several turns of the pepper grinder.\nOnce the veg has started to soften, but not colour,\nadd the wine and allow to cook-off for a few minutes.\nNow add the stock.\nOnce simmering, add the drained beans. Leave to\ncook uncovered for five minutes before adding the\npasta and kale (or whatever). Allow to simmer, for 10-15 minutes (You can check that it\u2019s cooked by tasting\na bit of potato which should be soft and crumbly to\nthe bite but not sloppy and dissolving).\nRemove the bay leaves, rosemary and thyme stalks\nwhere practical and adjust the seasoning if it needs\nit (I\u2019d suggest another good few turns of the pepper\nmill) before serving into warmed bowls.\nSprinkle with as much Parmesan as you fancy and\nfinish with a nice swirl of extra virgin olive oil. Make\nsure you have lots of crusty bread to hand and a\nglass of the same wine that you cooked with.\nWritten and Created by David Wallis\nfood.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n27\nFriday 23 January 2009 felix\nFood\nNatalia Jardon-King takes a prescription of Pie and Mash\nWho wouldn\u2019t feel instantly better after a plateload of that?

Pour the\nstodge into a grill-proof bowl or dish.\nBash together a packet of ready salted\ncrisps and mix with another handful\nof grated cheese. Sprinkle this mixture on top of the tuna/beany combo\nand grill until top, bubble and golden.\nServe with bread and a bit of salad, if\nyou like.\n2. Beany Beefy Nachos \u2013 TV food\nfor a night in. Fry 1 onion, 1 pack of\nmince, 1 cubed carrot, 1 clove of garlic\nand a pinch of paprika. When the meat\nis browned and the veg is softened, add\na tin of beans and a tin of chopped to-matoes. Cook with stirring for 10 minutes then add 200ml water and a stock\ncube. Simmer for a further 10 minutes\nthen season to taste. Pile the mixture\n\n"

Maybe all those people who\ngave money to the \u00a3136,000 campaign\nfunding the adverts did so because they\nNo more on the\nmatter\nThere\u2019s probably no God so\nstop worrying and enjoy life\nwith Nathan Sherwood\nweren\u2019t worried? I\u2019m told there are a lot\nof people with no worries and a lot of\nspare cash around these days, right?\nAnd surely the people who worked\non the advert must have realised that\nsomeone from the population of London was going to try and sue them for\nit. If they really weren\u2019t worried would\nthey really go to all this trouble to tell\nus \u2018Stop Worrying\u2019?\nAnd as for enjoying my life, I want\nto know whether the men and women\nwho spent hours working to produce\nan advertisement about a God they\ndon\u2019t believe is real had a lot of fun doing it.\nSeriously though, it strikes me that\nthe people who are most worried\nabout the existence of a God are the\npeople working hardest to tell us not\nto worry because there isn\u2019t one. And I\ncan sort of understand why they might.\nIf there is a god you wouldn\u2019t want to\nbe the one responsible for denying that\nhe or she exists; that would be like going home at Christmas and not just not\nbuying either of your parents anything\nto go under the tree because you don\u2019t\nthink they\u2019re there but actually putting\nposters up around their house denying\nthat either of them was real; you can\nsee how they\u2019d be annoyed.\nIf there really is no God then I guess\nwe\u2019re not really left with any other\nchoice than getting on with life, but\nif there\u2019s probably no God surely it\u2019s\nworth making sure that \u2018There is a\nGod. But don\u2019t worry, he offers eternal\nlife.\u2019 isn\u2019t a more accurate slogan?\nDuring the first week of February the\nChristian Union has organised a week\ncalled \u2018FREE\u2019 on campus because this\nguy called Jesus convinced well over a\nbillion people he is God. I suspect he\nmay have had slightly more impact\nthan all the adverts on all the sides of\nall the busses have ever achieved. Maybe it\u2019s worth finding out what he was\nreally about.\nThe Links Club would like to announce their award for any student within the City and\nGuilds College who is an active member within the Guilds or who has excelled on the\nsporting front.\nThe award is a bursary of \u00a3250 and will be presented to the eventual winner at The Links\nClub annual dinner in June 2009.\nCandidates must submit an application no longer than 250 words, either by email to\nhonsec@linksclub.org or hand it in to the CGCU office in a sealed envelope by 1st May\n2009. Entrants must outline why they believe they deserve the award.\nThe Links Club\nImperial College London\nW\nhat shocked me\nthe most about the\npost-US election\nmediacoveragewas\nnot so much that a\ndisproportionately large number of\nblack people were interviewed but that\nthe majority gave reaction of such jubilation and fervour at having \u201cone of us\u201d\nin the white house, that finally people\nare going to realise, as one AfricanAmerican lady put it, \u201cblack people\nain\u2019t just criminals and drug dealers,\nwe are smart and we do deserve to be\ntreated better\u201d.\nIt is true that people cross to the\nother side of the street when it\u2019s dark\nand they see a six-foot plus black man\nwalking towards their general direction\nand a black man working as a lawyer or\nfound reading a book that had nothing\nto do with sport or rap could be ribbed\nfor \u201cacting white\u201d. The question is:\nAmin Elmubarak believes\nyou can be anything!\nTrying to ascertain a behavioural set\nfor a white society seems futile when\nwe all know that the French, Swedish,\nEnglish and Irish are all different in\ntheir own way. So why is it acceptable\nto try to define a way of \u201cacting black\u201d?\nIs this racism or just the rest of society\ntaking their queue from black people?\nFor this, I\u2019m afraid we have to take\na quick trip through history. Black\npeople came from Africa, where they\nbelonged to different tribes. Each with\nits own history, culture and tradition\nand therefore its own identity and own\nway of acting. Although the concept of\nslavery existed for thousands of years,\nit tended to be the product of captured\nlosers in battle and the Arab trade\nroutes through the present-day Middle\nEast saw a thriving trade in slaves just\nas it did in spices and cattle. However,\nthe migration of Africans from the west\nof Africa to Bristol and then present-day America saw slaves being captured\nnot only by the \u201cWhite man\u201d but also\nby more powerful African tribes that\nsold them to white slave masters in return for harder-to-find resources such\nas weapons and other products.\nBack across the Atlantic, the new\nowners cared not from which part of\nAfrica their slaves originated or what\ndialect they spoke. As far as they were\nconcerned, they didn\u2019t speak English\nand that was that. Some just got on\nwith their new roles, as they felt helpless whilst others tried to resist and\nwere subsequently broken down. The\nresult was generation after generation\nthat were neither allowed access to\ntheir heritage nor accepted into this\nworld that they found themselves in.\nHistory saw the slow transition from\nslavery, to the freedom of slaves to the\ncivil rights movement then\u2026.. noth-ing. Not because there were any rules\nthat prevented black people from progressing but because black people in\nAmerica suddenly found themselves\nsharing a country with their white\ncounter-parts, where they are sharing\nthe same law, the same land, services\nand hopes for the future but when they\nlooked back, they did not a similar history nor could they find an identity\nthat they could relate to as it was an\nexistence without any freedom, neither\nof thought, ideas or traditions.\nThough Obama\u2019s victory was in the\npolitical arena, the hope for change\nthat he embodies goes beyond the\ncredit crunch, international terrorism\nand global warming. It would be na\u00efve\nto think that Obama will completely\nchange American foreign, environmental or economic policy over one\nfour-year term.\nHowever, the immediate change\nthat he has instilled is a new sense of\nbelief:\nThe young generation\u2019s belief in the\npower of the vote; the world\u2019s nostalgic belief in America as a vanguard for\njustice; But most of all, African American\u2019s belief in their abilities.\nTo borrow the words of Jay-Z:\n\u201cThese are oppressed people, what\nit represents is that we as a people\nare now part of the American dream.\nIt\u2019s not \u201cOh the black man is hot!\u201d \u2013 I\nhate it when people on T.V. say that.\nFor a kid in the Marcy Projects right\nnow can say, you know, maybe I can\nbe the President because for a part we\nwere left out of the American Dream\nat a certain point. Because for a part\nit was lawyers and doctors\u2026. Wow,\nthat\u2019s a black lawyer or a doctor, I can\ndo that too. Now the dream is you can\nbe ANYTHING and it\u2019s not clich\u00e9. You\ncan be anything you want to be in the\nworld, you\u2019re not left out of the American Dream. I think it\u2019s more important\nthan anything. The Hope of that.\u201d\nHistory, as well as recent events such\nas the credit crunch, have shown that\nthe world is like a pond: when a stone\nis dropped in the middle, the ripples\nwill spread and affect every leaf on its\nsurface. The American president may\nnot write the budget for the UK, Germany or France, but the ripples of any\nevent in America will filter towards us\nsooner or later.\nOn the 20th of January 2009, \u201cthe\nson of a man who would not have\nbeen served in a restaurant\u201d stood on\nthe steps of the same Capitol Hill that\nwas built by the whipped and bloodied\nhands of black slaves \u201cto take a most\nsacred oath\u201d. Who knows when those\nripples of hope will spread worldwide.\n\u201cObama has\ninstilled a new\nsense of belief\nin the young\ngeneration\u201d\nT\nhis is a story about love\nand hate. About two\nplayers in a game, linked\nonly by the deep bond of\na chemical dependency.\nAbout a crime that breaks no law only\nthe spirit of honest men. About one\nman\u2019s journey to the brink of despair.\nThis is a story about right and wrong.\u0003\t\nFor a long time now there has been\nan issue that has troubled most of us.\nThat has niggled just below the surface,\nsufficiently out of sight to not warrant\na cure. Something that we can all relate to but are equally powerless to do\nanything about. The problem I want to\nraise is the state of the union. \u0003\t\nThere are those among us who believe there is no problem. That the union has its faults but it is like a doddery\ngrandparent who we still love, despite\ntheir rampant racism and funny smell\n(the grand-parent and not the union of\ncourse). But in truth things are worse\nthan that. The line was crossed for me\nlast term. We all know too well of the\nstress a degree at this institution entails and some deal with this stress in\ndifferent ways. My way, and I\u2019m fairly\ncertain I\u2019m not alone on this one, is al-cohol. So how is it that at a time when\nwe are all penny-less from buying\nChristmas and teetering on the edge\nof insanity due to enormous workloads\nthat the union feels it necessary to pe-nalise us further by charging \u00a311 to get\nthrough the door. The fact I could have\na mince pie and mulled wine for my\n\u00a311 will not dig me out of debt or end\nmy stress-induced depression. This exploitation needs to end; we should not\nbe mugged by a group who apparently\nhave our best interests at heart.\u0003\t\nNow you may hear the supporters of\nthe union claim that the money goes\ntowardsthecostofpaying\u201cperformers\u201d\non ticketed nights. Published accounts\nshow that \u201centertainments\u201d cost the\nunion over \u00a394,000 in the year up July\n07, receiving only \u00a346,000 back in in-come. I\u2019m no accountant but that looks\nlike a bad piece of business to me and a\nnew strategy is needed. You need only\nto remember what the union booked\nthat totalled this large amount to see\nwhere things went wrong. I refuse to\nbelieve how someone with such little\nmusical ability as \u201cAlexa Chung\u201d was let\nnear a set of decks let alone paid for it.\nWhat made it worse for her, and even\nmore apparent of her complete lack of\ntalent, was that she was followed up by\nWill Kay, who I am assured was not being paid \u00a34000+to play a CD contain-ing, among other hits the \u201cRaw-hide\u201d\ntheme (\u00a34000 is the fee reported in the\nLondon Paper for Ms. Chung\u2019s service\nat an alternative venue). Maybe if the\nunion focussed on the abundant in-house talent like Will and DJ Abyss\namong so many others, it could reduce\nticket prices by dropping musical nobodies like Ms Chung. I\u2019m not trying\nto dictate union policy here, I for one\nam partial to a bit of Colin Murray on a\nFriday night, but we shouldn\u2019t be made\nto pay through the nose for people who\nare not really entertaining.\t\u0003\t\nYou may think that this article has descended into a mindless rant but I am\nnot of the angry-geek mould. I do want\nthis solved and need not write into to\ntheses hallowed pages again. My solution is obvious, lower the price of end\nof term events, by employing more\nIC talent and dropping the gimmicks.\nThe union must learn that rotating\nmechanical animals, be they bulls or\nreindeer or Easter bunnies, do not get\npeople through the door. Neither will\nthe talent vacuum that encompasses\nmost radio 1 DJs. The potential of\ncheap night out with mates will inevitably draw people in. It is a simple case\nof priorities; the union should be serving us not us serving them as we spunk\nour student loans on outrageous entry\nprices. \u0003\t\nWe begrudgingly accepted the increase in this year\u2019s alcohol prices and\nthe move from Carlsberg to Fosters as\na sign of the times and I for one think\nthe unions drink pricing is great. If only\nI could get through the door without\npissing away my money on the ticket\ncost. The trouble is there is not much\nwe can do. If we boycott, as I did this\nChristmas, we achieve nothing. I plodded round to the Queens Arms, gasped\nat the price of a pint and skulked home\nin a huff. The powers that be in the\nunion will see boycotting as student\napathy and continue on in there mindless ways. And so this is my question to\nyou. What can we do? I have raised the\nissue, given it a platform, now we need\nto push on and sort this mess out. Is\nit really reasonable to expect a student\nthat reaches the end of the year, when\nthe cupboard is at its most empty, to\npay \u00a335 for a ticket for the last night at\nthe union? I refuse to believe that that\namount of money could ever come\nclose to offering value and that the current state of affairs is criminal. I think\nit is a robbery in the making and since\nwe know the criminal and know the\ncrime it is time we had our justice.\nDifferent Class: four grand don\u2019t come for\nfree...\n\u201cMy solution is\nlower the price\nof events by\nemploying more\nIC talent and\ndropping the\ngimmicks\u201c\n\u201cThere is a God.\nBut don\u2019t worry,\nhe offers eternal\nlife.\u201d\nT\nhe following are extracts\nfrom the recently-trans-lated Book of Obama, a\nreligious text dating from\nthe early 21st Century.\nPossible errors in translation are not to\nbe attributed to this publication.\n1:1. And lo, on the forty-third day,\nthe Saviour of Men came unto his\npeople. And the praise and exultation poured forth as the mighty ocean\nwaves pound against the shore, or as\nthe cold winds of January bite shrewdly\nat those for whom no earmuffs have\nbeen provided.\n1:2. \u201cWe are your people,\u201d shouted\nthe multitude, \u201cfor yours is the power,\nand the glory, and the life everlasting.\u201d\n\u201cWoohoo\u201d, came the cry from the back\nof the crowd and from isolated pockets\nnear the front. And the throats of the\npeople went hoarse with the intensity\nof their delight, and they were reduced\nto waving small oblong pieces of cloth\non sticks to indicate their jubilation.\n1:3. And the Saviour emerged onto\nthe balcony of the temple, where but\nlately he had stood waging battle with\nnonbelievers from both sides of the\naisle. His gait was purposeful and his\nframe was elegant, and as he walked\ntall at the side of his wife the thoughts\nof the masses remembered how much\nmore attractive she was than those\nwho had come before her, and how\npretty she looked in that golden dress\nwith the fabulous matching coat and\nthe divine dark green gloves which\nso many women thought were daring\nand yet so becoming at the same time,\nweren\u2019t they just?\n1:4. And as the chosen couple advanced to their seats, there was much\nwaving and flashing of teeth, and the\nraucous joy of the people was transmitted to television sets all over the\nworld, in the attempt to make the\nAscension of our Lord a truly family-friendly event.\n...\n3:8. \u201cWhat is your name, old man?\u201d\nasked the Saviour of Men of the man\nto his left.\n\u201cI am George, son of George; for ten\ngenerations in this land of the house of\nBush.\u201d\n\u201cAh,\u201d quoth the Chosen One: \u201ctruly,\nfor I have seen your effigies - there is\nindeed great wonder to be found in the\nsight of a burning Bush.\u201d\nAnd the people did groan loudly as\nones affected by pain, and yet laughed\nin spite of themselves with the laughter\nof the faithful. \u201cTruly,\u201d shouted a lone\nvoice from the congregation, through\ntears of mirth and of suffering, \u201cHis\nwisecracks are as cheap oil over troubled waters, and his puns sparkle like\nthe stars in a sky free of excess carbon\ndioxide, acidic pollutants or smog.\u201d\n\u201cYea,\u201d chanted the masses, \u201cwe are\nindeed blessed.\u201d\n...\n4:3. And He regaled them with his\nexploits among the Pharisees and the\nmoneylenders in their golden temples\non Wall Street. How he made them\noverturn their own trading tables and\nrun, panicked, out of their houses of\nsin and extravagance.\n\u201cTell us, O great one,\u201d the people\ncried in astonishment, \u201chow did one\nman accomplish such a feat?\u201d\n\u201cI stood among them, and in front of\ntheir eyes transformed a live bull into\nthe stuffed carcass of a bear.\u201d And the\npeople saw in him the innocence of a\nchild, but not in a racist way, of course,\nthat goes without saying.\n...\n5:6. At the Capitol did he deliver\nthe Sermon on the Hill, which poured\nforth with words both soothing and\ninvigorating, both calm and watchful,\nboth peaceful and redolent with power.\nAlbert. \u201cBlessed are the meek, for they\nwill be too timid to enter the long and\ntiring legal procedure needed to establish that they are the ones next in line\nto inherit the Earth.\nBlessed are the peacemakers, for they\nwill be called sons of God.\u201d\n5:7. At this, a great wind roared over\nthe assembly, which sent forth chills\ninto the hearts of men, whatever their\nskin colour, gender and sexual orientation might have been. And the Saviour\nof Men looked over at George, son of\nGeorge, and delivered unto the people\nhis well-worn message:\n\u201cChange we needeth. Can we accomplish such a feat?\u201d And the voice of the\npeople returned as one:\n\u201cVerily we may!\u201d\n...\n7:5 And the Messiah turned unto his\nfriend Joseph, and did purge him of\nthe Vice which was to have been fixed\nto his name forever more, and looked\nupon him with devotion.\n...\n7:8: \u201cAnd what say you unto Hillary?\u201d\nAsked Joseph. \u201cCome forth, Hillary.\u201d\nAnd Hillary stepped forward and was\nembraced by the Messiah as having\nseen the light and renounced the ways\nof darkness she had hitherto followed.\n\u201cAnd what words have you for Rahm?\u201d\nEnquired Joseph. \u201cStep forward,\nRahm.\u201d And Rahm advanced unto his\nMaster and was accepted as among the\nchosen, to stay at the right arm of the\nSaviour until disaster, old age, or bad\npublicity brought on by his uncontrollable temper would drive them apart.\n...\n9:11: And the voice of the Saviour of\nMen rang out loud and clear in the icy\nstillness of the morning. \u201cThe reign of\nSatan is ended. Get thee behind me,\nSatan.\u201d\n9.12: And the people did cheer him\nwith the name he had taken as a mor-tal, and repeated the name of Obama\nas the Saviour of Men ascended to the\nGreat White House.\nGilead Amit engages in some light archaeology\nT\nhe subject of Israel and\nGaza is always going to be\na controversial one. The\nconflict in the Middle East\nhas raged for decades,\nwith roots going back millenia, and the\ntopic\u2019s lengthy history makes any concise coverage impossible.\nEmotions are also easily aroused on\nall sides, and with debates on the topic\nflaring up so easily, I made the decision\nlast week that the conflict currently occurring in Gaza will only be covered in\none week\u2019s issue. My decision to limit\nto one week meant that I ensured all\nthe comment pieces selected were ones\nI deemed to be very well written and\ncovered all the points considered nec-essary. Effectively we had both sides of\nthe story, and to add to the neutrality\nof the page as a whole, I included the\npiece by Amin Elmubarak which maintained a fairly neutral tone. As a news-paper, I didn\u2019t want it to seem that we\nwere coming down unequivocally on\none side, and I believe that we were\nable to achieve this.\nMy feelings about the page were cemented when I received several letters,\ncomments and opinions about them\nthroughout the week. As expected,\nboth sides were claiming inaccuracies\nin what the other had to say with not a\nsingle one claiming any errors or problems with the one by Amin. In fact, so\nmany e-mails were sent to me that if I\nwere to print them all, it would take up\n6 pages.\nAs you can see, and as already men-tioned, there are no comment pieces\nabout the conflict this week. To those\nof you who did write in, a big thank you,\nand it is a big thank you for two main\nreasons; firstly you are all reading the\npaper which makes me feel happy, and\nsecondly you all feel strongly enough\nin what you believe that you speak out.\nThe problem is that I don\u2019t want the\npaper to be over-run by this one top-ic, which it easily can as the topic has\nbeen fiercely argued for years.\nSo apologies once again to those\nof you who did submit something\nthis week, and I hope you can understand why I have put an end to the\ndiscussion.\nAs one eagle-eyed reader pointed\nout, the newspaper needs to point out\nwhen it makes a mistake. Apart from\nthe various spelling and grammar mistakes that creep through (which we\ndon\u2019t really apologise for since they\u2019re\nalways going to happen \u2013 as a side note,\nwe are working on a new system which\nshould reduce the number of these!)\nSo apologies for last week. Firstly the\nerror in the Politics section regarding the tank. The caption under the\npicture of the tank on page 11 of last\nweeks issue (1,420) read \u201cIsraeli tanks\npreparing for an increase in hostilities\nwith Palestine\u201d. We apologise for the\nmistake made as the tank in the picture\nwas actually a tank from the Indian\nmilitary. So to all of you who wrote in\nto point this out, apologies.\nSecondly there was the comment\nmade by Politics editor James Goldsack referring to the Jewish community as \u201cour big-nosed friends\u201d. He has issued an apology in his Politics section,\nwhich can be found on page 12.\nThirdly, on the story entitled \u201cHeathrowexpansionplansaffectICsports\u201dby\nCharles Murdoch, he wrote that Sport\nImperial were planning on moving the\nsports ground to the London Borough\nof Ealing in a place called Norwood\nGreen not Northwood Green.\nAs I said, to all of you who have emailed in pointing out these errors, I\nam, as ever, grateful for your help.\nTo finish off my column, I thought I\nmight use this opportunity to tell you\nall of the big events coming up this\nterm, the main two being ArtsFest\nWeek (16th-20th February) and Varsity (25th February). These two events\nshowcase two of the biggest things at\nImperial; it\u2019s every growing creative\nside, and the sporting rivalry between\nthe medical school and Imperial. Keep\nan eye out for posters in the coming\nweeks.\n\n"

Catherine Jones reviews a very eclectic bar with a message\ncultural fusion. Samples of Congolese\nand Western hospitality are mixed to-gether, and we get to enjoy the results.\nThe club is the brainchild of The\nCarsten Holler Project by Fondazione\nPrada. It does indeed look very de-signer. The three areas of the venue\nare divided equally between Congolese\nand Western spaces but we spent most\nof the night in the spacious courtyard\narea. An eclectic mix of plastic furni-ture, cobbles, tiles, murals and posters\ndemarketed the two spaces.\nAt 9pm the bar was half full, and we\nwere quickly served by the friendly\nstaff. The drinks menu contained a\nvariety of cocktails, wines and a few\nbeers. They were a tad on the expensive side, but after all, it is in London.\nDrinks in hand we headed straight to\nthe empty area, perching on the edge\nof a swimming pool-like tiled corner.\nIn the background, a sound track of\nCongolese music. Well, mostly Congolese. I was shocked to hear \u201cI Want\nto Know What Love Is\u201d by Foreigner at\nThe Double Club HHHHH\n7 Torrens Street, EC1 Angel\nBest: Laid back vibe and\nfriendly staff.\nWorst: Expensive drinks.\nLondon rather than Kimbasa\nprices\nFree entry and free cloakroom\nA\nfew weeks ago, I paid a\nvisit to a cultural furore\n(!) of a new bar. I love\nbars, especially the Union. Sometimes though,\nyou have to try something new. So why\nnot a bar-club-restaurant-and-art in-stallation, with a unique fusion of Congolese and Western culture?\nAs per usual, the night started in\nconfusion, with a total failure to meet\nat the right place on time. This is not\nexactly surprising. The Double Club\nis tucked away at the end of Torrens\nStreet, near Angel tube station. The\ninconspicuous warehouse doors hide\nbehind a gazebo. Upon arrival though,\nthe welcome made up for it. The staff\nsmiled and took our coats to the free\ncloakroom. We made our way through\nthe white arty entrance rooms, into the\ncourtyard bar and it just goes to show,\nyou never know what may be lurking\nbehind a door.\nThe Double Club concept is one of\none point during the night.\nAs the bar became busier at 11pm, we\nchecked out the discotheque room next\ndoor. It was modestly sized, but still\nvery impressive. Revellers crammed\nonto the rotating dance floor, while\nflashing lights and mirrored disco balls\norbited above their heads.\nAs for music, The Double Club operates an \u201call inclusive\u201d music policy.\nContemporary Congolese band Sound\nAfrica performed earlier that night.\nDJs packed out the place, alternating\nsounds across cultures. The crowd embraced the fusion vibe, and the fusion\ncontinued on to the dance floor. I\u2019m\nnot a great dancer at the best of times,\nbut there were some slightly embarrassing blends of bad drunken dancing\nto be seen that night.\nThe Double Club seems the ideal\nkind of venue to come and chat with\nfriends, simply because of the relax-ing, harmonious vibe. This may sound\ncheesy, but I had an inspirational mo-ment, turning my gaze upwards, finding a full moon shining through the\nglass roof. At that beautiful moment I\ndecided to award The Double Club 5\nstars out of 5, and will consider visiting\nagain and again.\nThe Double Club is donating half\nof its profits to the City of Joy\ncharity, supporting projects to\nhelp abused women and children\nin the Congo. So you can party\nguilt free, but there is no guarantee you will avoid the hangover .\n\u201cI was shocked\nto hear \u2018I want to\nknow what love\nis\u2019 by Foreigner\nat one point!\u201d\n\n"

Write to us.\nclubsandsocs.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nClubs & Socs Editor - Alice Rowlands\nDuring the holiday season, we are\nbombarded by appeals from charities \u2013 often, each as worthy as the last.\nSo what makes Medecins Sans Frontieres special? Its purpose is, according to Secretary General Chris Stokes,\nto \u201c[concentrate] on saving lives now\nuntil they can be rebuilt tomorrow.\u201d\nMSF provides medical and humanitarian relief in an emergency situation,\nwhich is phased out as need declines.\nIts credo specifies that intervention\nis based on human need, irrespective\nof political or religious boundaries, in\nterms of donor, geographical area (it is\ncurrently active in over 60 countries)\nand recipients.\nThe scale and diversity of MSF\u2019s\nprojects sets them apart from other\nNGOs in the field, as does their commitment to raising awareness about\nthe situations in which MSF volunteers\nwork.\nField missions, composed of medical\nand non-medical volunteers, are tailored to the situation according to the\nfindings of a reconnaissance team. The\nmedical staff are national healthcare\nprofessionals, who provide the framework for continued support, and international volunteers.\nThe international volunteers take\nsabbaticals from 6 weeks up to several\nyears to provide medical aid in some\nof the world\u2019s most acutely affected\nregions. The non-medical logisticians\nmake the medical volunteers work pos-sible. Their remit includes establishing\nand co-ordinating a supply chain (in-corporating medical equipment, food\nand safe water), training long-term\nstaff to ensure the sustainability of\nmissions and educating the population\nat risk. This is as challenging than providing medical aid, given the nature of\nthe situations that MSF tackles: a limited or damaged infrastructure, such\nas after the 2005 Pakistani earthquake;\nfrontlines in armed conflict, for exam-ple, during Lebanon, where MSF experienced hostile fire whilst providing\nmedical aid to Christians and Muslims\nfrom 1976-1984; and active hostility from local groups, like in Somalia,\nwhere the deliberate killing of 3 MSF\noperatives forced them to withdraw\ninternational operatives last August.\nHere, although MSF continues to provide primary health care, treatment for\nthe malnourished and displaced as well\nas water and supply relief, thanks to the\ncourageofnationalstaff,theheadofthe\nmission there, Kenneth Lavelle, decries\nthe political situation that limits them\nto \u201cimmediate life-saving needs\u2026most\ncertainly inadequate when taking into\naccount the gravity of the situation\u201d.\nThe scale and diversity of MSF\u2019s\nprojects is astounding: in 2007, they\ncarried out 8,447,106 outpatient consultants and dealt with 340,689 in-As fighting intensified in the Democratic Republic of Congo during 2008,\nan estimated 250,000 civilians fled\ntheir homes adding to the million already displaced. Fuelled by the country\u2019s rich mineral resources and lack\nof cross country communications,\narmed groups led by General Nkunda\nhave clashed in eastern DRC in North\nKivu. The reasons for this new uprising are unclear, at least partially based\non an attempt to rid Congo of its Hutu\nrebels; however, its effects are all too\nevident. As well as the war wounded,\nmany are suffering under the atrocities\nof both sides including mass rape. Not\nto mention the malnutrition endured\nby countless civilians across the coun-try, increasing the spread of diseases\nsuch as cholera.\nMSF has been in the DRC since 1987.\nThe resurgence of fighting has made it\nvery difficult to ensure aid is reaching those who need it most as they are\noften in hiding or constantly on the\nmove. MSF has strengthened its established projects (such as HIV and sexual\nhealth service) and opened a new one\nin Masisi in North Kivu. MSF staffed\nbegan to work at the Masisi hospital\nin which had to more than double its\nmaximum bed capacity. Mobile teams\nare also sent out to treat people when\nthey are deemed to be relatively safe.\nM\nSF, like many charitable organisations, have numerous projects \u2018on the go\u2019 at once. Their projects are in\ncountries across the world, from places as close as\nFrance to war torn countries in Africa.\nHere are some of the cases from what MSF consider\nto be the worst humanitarian crises:\nIn Somalia, some of the worst violence in over a decade was seen\nin 2008. There is a lack of basic healthcare and a prolonged drought\nhas exacerbated problems. Many have been left susceptible to malnutrition and disease. To tackle this health centres have been set up\nin residential areas which provide a source of healthcare to those\nwho need it most, as well as providing a source of clean water for\nmany.\nWar in Iraq has displaced four million people and there are big\ngaps in healthcare provision in certain areas. MSF runs surgical programs for war wounded patients, numerous burns units in both Iraq\nand Kurdistan and is supplying hospitals throughout the region.\nCyclone Nargis in 2008 left Myanmar in a terrible state. MSF has\nworked to probide food, shelter, water, healthcare and support. HIV/\nAIDS is also a big problem here which MSF is attempting to tackle\nthrough education and support.\nNorthwest Pakistan has seen some terrible fighting over the last\nyear and many of the residents have been displaced elsewhere.\nMSF has been treating the war wounded, providing clean water and\nopening mobile health clinics.\nThere was a devastating earthquake in Balochistan recently, leaving 40,000 homeless. As a charity, MSF has been working to provide\nemergency medical support and relief supplies.\nThese examples represent a mere fraction of the work that MSF\ndoes worldwide. Continued support of their work is vital to provide\nsome relief for the people who are suffering.\nImperial\u2019s Friends of Medecins Sans Frontieres (FoMSF), which\nformed in 2006, is an ICU society that provides a platform for Imperial students to contribute to the work of MSF through various activities such as fundraising events, guest speakers, and film screenings.\nWe are part of the wider National FoMSF.\nThe individual FoMSF societies at different universities across the\nUK & Ireland share the same two aims: Firstly, raising awareness\nabout MSF\u2019s work and to encourage students to consider working\nwith MSF and similar NGOs (non-government organisations) in the\nfuture; and secondly, raising funds for MSF\u2019s general work and their\ncampaigns.\nImperial FoMSF have a number of events planned for this year\nincluding: A fundraising roller-disco, sales of Krispy Kremes on the\nSouth Kensington Campus, \u2018Who wants to save a million lives\u2019 raffle \u2013 the best prizes that you\u2019ll ever see \u2013 a screening of the award-winning documentary \u2018Invisibles\u2019, produced by Javier Bardem.\nSaki Onda writes about Imperial\u2019s Friends\nof Medicins Sans Frontiers\nFriends of Medicins Sans Frontiers\nImperial\u2019s Friends of Medicins Sans Frontiers discuss activities on campus and MSF\u2019s role in the wider world\npatient admissions, encompassing\npreventative and curative responses.\nThis is illustrated by MSF\u2019s cohesive\nmeningitis programme in Sub-Saharan\nAfrica, where they vaccinate, treat outbreaks (preventing epidemics from\ndeveloping) and collect statistics (ena-bling epidemiological tracking).\nMSF manage complex chronic disease such as HIV/AIDS patients co-infected with tuberculosis, working in\nsituations with otherwise inadequate\nhealthcare access, such as in refugee\naid camps.\nMSF also provides emergency humanitarian assistance, like blankets,\nhygiene kits, safe water (which may require new wells and treatment plants\nto be set up) and the establishment of\ntherapeutic feeding and rehydration\ncentres. Their Campaign for Access\nto Essential Medications pressurises\npharmaceutical companies to fund the\ncontinued production of existing drugs\nand the development of new drugs targeting diseases that primarily afflict\ndeveloping countries.\nMSF\u2019s establishment in 1971 was\nlargely due to doctors\u2019 frustrations with\nthe International Red Cross (IRC) during the 1967-1970 Nigerian civil war.\nThe Nigerian government enforced\na blockade of the secessionist Biafran\nregion, resulting in appalling human\nsuffering. The IRC can only maintain\nits impartiality \u2013 and hence access to\ncertain locations or individuals in need\n\u2013 through a refusal to comment on\nthe situation. These doctors, however,\nbelieved that their silence made them\ncomplicit in their patients\u2019 plight. Ever\nsince, raising awareness of humanitarian crises is central to MSF\u2019s activities,\nthrough presentations by volunteers,\npublications and lobbying the diplomatic community.\nAn excellent example is southern\nSudan, where MSF has maintained\nmissions since 1979, decrying civilian\ntorture an executions whilst providing\nrelief for disease (including TB, ebola,\ncholera) and famine against a backdrop of government interference and\nfighting.\nAlthough MSF may work alongside\na Ministry of Health, to maintain full\ncontrol of its projects and the ability to\nspeak out, it cannot be affiliated with\nany political, religious or economic\nentity. 80% of MSF\u2019s funds come from\nprivate donations: their activities collectively consume \u20ac600m per year.\nThis explains why the work of fundraising groups, like the IC FoMSF,\nare so important to the organisation\u2019s\ncontinued success. It is also a source\nof hope: newspapers are full of reports\nre-enforcing the perception of humankind as being \u201ctribally\u201d divided \u2013 by\nnation, race and religion, the situation\nin Gaza being the latest example.\nThe fact that individuals donate to\nsave the lives of others with no connection to them selves is proof of the\nunderlying brotherhood of man.\nKaushali Trivedi\nOn the evening of Friday 14th November, the Imperial College Iraqi Society made history \u2013 it conducted the\nfirst ever Iraqi Cultural Exhibition on\ncampus.\nThe ten-man committee managed\nto organise probably the largest, most\nvaried interface of London-wide contemporary Iraqi organisations in the\nspace of a few hours. With the presence of over 17 different organisations,\nthe IC Iraqi Society gathered crowds\nof Iraqis and non-Iraqis from all major universities in London, as well as\nfamilies and businessmen, and nearly\n200 people attended to hear it from the\nhorse\u2019s mouth \u2013 how to get involved in\nmajor projects on Iraq today, as well as\nIraqi culture and heritage.\nRepresentatives from the British\nMuseum gave first hand information\non the current Babylonian Exhibition,\nwhich aims to run until March 2009.\nThe British Institute for the Study of\nIraq (BISI) gave an insight into archaeological heritage and contemporary\nissues surrounding the preservation of\nartefacts. This contrasted with student\nbased organisations, such as the Student Iraqi Medical Association (SIMA)\nand Kurdish Studies and Student Organisation (KSSO), who represented\nstudent networking organizations in\ntheir respective fields. Other UK networking organizations included Iraqi\nAcademics Association and Iraqi Professionals, and Iraqi culture was covered by Zipang and Culture for All, as\nwell as calligraphy and textiles (by Aziz\nal-Naib and Najlaa Khalil respectively),\nproducing an enticing amalgamation\nof talents. We were also delighted to\nwelcome Al-Iraqiya TV Station, one of\nthe largest Iraqi international broadcasters \u2013 who filmed the event and\nMore recently, more than thirty people are suspected to have contracted\nthe deadly Ebola virus. An MSF team\nof nine Ebola specialists from Kinshasa\nand Brussels is currently working in\nWestern Kasai. An isolation ward in\nthe village of Kampungu is being built\nand the medical team is also providing\ncare to all people suspected of having\nthe disease.

With\ncontrasting fortunes so far in ULU Division 1, Imperial 4s and 5s took to the\nastroturf of Fortress H on an inclement\nDecember Saturday.\nThe build up to the match had been\ntinged with gamesmanship, with the 4s\nclamouring to rearrange. Possibly running scared of a highly motivated and\ncapable 5th team, possibly demanding extra time to find their way to the\nvenue. Even with the postponement, 4s\ncaptain Jeremy didn\u2019t take to the pitch,\nhis underwear still brown after the\nshanking from his 5s counterpart Ron\nin the reverse fixture.\nThe 5s started well, Lobster setting\nthe tone with an outrageous flick over\nInty in the first minute.

Mike Turrell\u2019s relentless running\non the left wing was causing problems\nand Tom Adams was a proving handful for Dyke Allen and Marqueef. The\n5s dominance was particularly evident\nin the centre where Matty Smith and\nJonny Hill were being bossed by Ron,\nMarvin from JLS and Jam Jam. They\nwere however finding it hard to break\ndown the two banks of four and test\nrugby fan Skeen in the 4s goal.\nThe pressure soon paid off though\nwhen a clearance from the Lapin was\ninexplicably left by both Dyke and the\nQueef and Tom Adams was in like a\nflash to slot past the schoolboy. The\n4s were shaken and their centre halves\nthen contrived to gift the 5s another\ngoal. Ron chased a lost cause on the\nright and managed to pull the ball back\nto the edge of the six yard box. Calls of\n\u201cClear it!\u201d from Skeen were ignored by\nMarqueef who smashed the ball into\nhis own top corner. 2-0.\nAt half-time Jeremy made his last\ntwo substitutions and a tactical reshuf-fle, trying to find some penetration on\ntheir left, where Winehands and X-factor winner Dan Abooby were solid in\nboth defence and attack.

Additionally, half a million Palestinians are without\nwater, electricity supplies are\nalso patchy and humanitarian\naid supplies from donor countries are trickling through the\nRafah crossing with Egypt.\nMeanwhile Amnesty International has accused Israel of war\ncrimes by indiscriminately using\nwhite phosphorus munitions in\ndensely populated areas, something which the Israeli Defence\nForce is already investigating,\nand in Kuwait City, a meeting of\nthe Arab League to discuss how\nto help rebuild Gaza ended in\ndiscord as its 22 members failed\nto agree on a plan.\nPalestine\nEdited by Hassan Joudi\nNone of the doctors responsible for the\nMedical Training Application Service\n(MTAS) fiasco will face disciplinary action from the General Medical Council\n(GMC) because their bad decisions\nweren\u2019t made in a clinical setting, junior doctors have been told.\nThe useless MTAS system, which\nwas meant to match junior doctors to\ntraining posts, left thousands of qualified doctors jobless. It was condemned\nas unfair and inefficient, suffered\ntechnical failures and serious security\nbreaches which left applicants\u2019 personal details exposed on the MTAS\nwebsite.\nThe junior doctors\u2019 pressure group\nRemedy spearheaded the campaign\nfor an investigation in to what was the\nmost called-for professional referral to\nthe GMC in medical history.\nHowever, the GMC rejected the demand for an enquiry into the role and\nperformance of the doctors who were\ninvolved in developing the system, telling Remedy:\n\u201cThe allegations of misconduct must\nbe concerned with poor performance\nin a clinical setting.\u201d\nDina Ismail\nNews Correspondent\nThe meeting of Union Council last\nnight voted overwhelmingly in favour\nof creating a new Sabbatical position\nto divide the role of Deputy President\n(Education & Welfare). The paper, presented for the second time in as many\nmeetings, was passed with 36 votes to\n2, with one of these votes being made\nvia proxy and therefore not privy to the\ndebate during the meeting.\nAt the previous meeting in December\nsome members of Council felt that the\npaper was rushed and ill thought-out\nand, despite winning over a simple majority vote, it did not receive the two-thirds required to pass. Current DPEW,\nHannah Theodorou, said that it was\n\u201ctough to make a decision on whether\nto bring the paper back to Council\u201d,\nstating that her reason was not because\nshe thought that the Council had made\nthe wrong decision, but because young\nundergraduates who \u201cdon\u2019t understand\nthe ins-and-outs of Union politics\u201d felt\nupset that the paper had been rejected,\nand wanted it to be re-submitted.\nCouncil Chair, Afonso Campos, relinquished the Chair during the discussion and vote on this paper as he\ndid not feel that he could be un-biased\nin his role. felix Editor in Chief, Jovan\nNedic, stepped up to the position to the\nobjection of Deputy President (Finance\n& Services), Christian Carter. Mr Carter claimed that the Felix Editor was\nsimilarly unable to claim neutrality due\nto his comments at previous meetings\nand the Sabbatical Review Working\nGroup. Mr Nedic quickly defended his\nposition, stating that he had to remain\nneutral as the editor of felix, and only\nstepped in with opinions previously in\norder to speed up the meeting.\nThe revised paper addressed many\nof the issues that had been neglected\nat the previous meeting. Most impor-tantly, ICU President Jenny Morgan\nhas confirmed that \u201cif we don\u2019t have\nassurance that we\u2019re going to have the\nmoney from the NUS pot then we will\nnot create these new positions\u201d. The\ncouncil requested that this assurance\ncome in the form of written confirmation from a senior member of college\nstaff by February 9th - before nominations for the position open. The paper\nwill be circulated to the Trustee Board\nvia email for their approval to allow a\ndecision to be made at College Council in time for the upcoming Sabbatical\nElections.\nThe original papers to Council called\nfor one of the new positions to be the\nDeputy President (Education and Development), however it was proposed\nto change it to Deputy President (Edu-cation) just before the final vote took\nplace. After a bit of a discussion it be-New Sabbaticals for\nEducation and Welfare\nLawrence Weetman\nLive! News Reporter\ncame clear that it didn\u2019t really matter,\nwith a vote of 15-14 making the positions Deputy President (Education)\nand Deputy President (Welfare).\nThe issue of the NUS affiliation\nmoney was also raised. Many students\nbased their decision on NUS disaffilia-tion on the fact that the money could\nbe used for other Union matters. Deputy President (Clubs and Societies),\nLily Topham, asked whether the rest\nof the NUS affiliation money would be\navailable to the Union after the DPE\nand DPW roles had been funded. Miss\nMorgan confirmed that the Union\nwould fight for the full amount, however ruled out an increased budget for\nthe Union building re-development, as\nthis does not fall within the scope of\nthe Union\u2019s subvention.\nDeputy President Education and Welfare Hannah Theodorou passing\nround papers showing the hectic schedule that the previous role has\nPHoto by Sami Michaels\nThe British government has shelved plans to exempt MPs (Member of\nParliament) from certain parts of the Freedom of Information Act.\nAfter losing a case in the High Court last year, the House of Commons\n(lower house) was on the brink of publishing receipts for every expense claim\nmade by an MP since 2005, putting them on the same level as other paid\nBritish public officials like civil servants and MSPs (Member of the Scottish\nParliament). Initially assuming all-party support, the government\u2019s proposed\nchange to the law would have blocked pending requests for more information under the Freedom of Information Act. But in the weekly Prime Minister\u2019s Questions on Wednesday 21st January, Gordon Brown said he would\nnot press ahead with the proposal, citing the withdrawal of support from the\nopposition Conservative and Lib Dem parties.\nCritics were sceptical of the government\u2019s proposed changes, saying they\nwere deliberately announced this week, when the news headlines were filled\nwith Obama\u2019s inauguration and Heathrow\u2019s third runway plans, in order to\n\u201cbury bad news.\u201d\nUnited Kingdom\nNetherlands\nA Dutch court has ruled that Geert Wilders, a right-wing politician,\nshould be prosecuted for inciting racial hatred.\nThree judges from the Amsterdam Appeals Court weighed Wilders\u2019 anti-Islamic rhetoric against his right to free speech with regards to his 17-minute\nfilm \u201cFitna\u201d, which was released in\nMarch 2008. The film showed verses\nof the Muslim holy book the Quran\ninterspersed with images of terror-ism; the judges reversed a decision\nfrom last year, and this time ruled\nthat Wilders\u2019 had broken the law, thus\nsetting the stage for what is likely to\nbe a highly charged trial.\nWilders, who is the leader of the\nFreedom Party which has 9 out of\n120 seats in the Dutch Parliament, is\nan outspoken critic of Islam. He has\nmade controversial statements about\nMuslims before, calling for a ban on\nthe Quran in the same way that Hitler\u2019s \u201cMein Kampf\u201d is banned, and\nsaying \u201cI\u2019ve had enough of Islam in\nthe Netherlands; let not one more\nMuslim immigrate.\u201d\nGMC rejects call for enquiry into MTAS\nMany have found this stance to be\na baffling duplicity of standards in\naccountability.\nEarlier last year TV psychiatrist Raj\nPersaud was suspended from practice\nover plagiarism in a book and various\narticles he had written for medical\njournals and newspapers, which was\nhardly a \u2018clinical setting.\u2019 Many recent\ncases that the GMC has handled relate\nto doctors\u2019 conduct entirely unrelated\nto patients. Cases from 2008 include\nseveral doctors suspended for motoring offences, financial misconduct and\nanother who looked at porn via hospital computers.\nThese were clearly cases of wrong\ndoing, but the cost to the health service\nhas been negligible compared to the\nharmful impact of the failed MTAS.\nDemonstrators against the enquiry into the MTAS fiasco\nThe Beauty Of Democracy\nObama\u2019s Inauguration\nThe biting cold meant that at 3am, 9\nhours before the swearing in, I was\nhuddled with a group of students\nfrom Michigan who had driven down\nto Washington that evening. We joked\nthat the first black President of the\nUnited States might have a lot in his\nin-tray, but at least he had a warm bed\nto sleep in that night. Hours before\nwe had met in a Ghanaian live music\nbar where a 53-year-old black D.C.\nresident grabbed the singer\u2019s microphone and emotionally declared that\nthe mistakes of the past didn\u2019t matter\nanymore because \u201csomething beautiful is going to happen tomorrow\u201d.\nAmerica has a guilty past and\nObama\u2019s election is an answer to the\nquestions that this guilty past invites.\nHas equality been achieved? Is there\nstill discrimination? Where is there a\nceiling? Something that I heard over\nand over in Washington is that people never thought it would happen.\nObama had asked them to hope, but\nmost of all they had been scared of\npast racial and political demons coming back to haunt them again; scared\nof being let down.\nFor my generation, the generation\nthat used new information technology to help put Obama in office, this\nwas always a peculiar idea. Without\nthe memory of segregation and the\nexperience of discrimination the notion of skin colour being a barrier to\noffice had been frightening but alien.\nFor the 70 year old grandmother from\nthe South who stood her own in sub-zero temperatures amongst a group of\nteenagers the end of racial discrimination had never been powerfully prov-en. Her generation had dreamt of that\none day when their children might be\njudged solely on their character but\nthat day had never been symbolically\ndemonstrated. For as long as Martin\nLuther King Jr\u2019s dream remained just\nthat both in reality and in the AfricanAmerican consciousness, the proud\nAmerican ideals of freedom and\nequality would be tainted with the\nsweat and blood of black slaves. The\nelection of Barack Obama is not liberal America\u2019s apology for slavery but\nit is, in the words of VicePresident Al Gore, \u201cthe redemption of the revolutionary promise that all men are\nborn equal\u201d.\nBut this inauguration was\nmore than the realisation of\na dream. It was the vindication of American democ-racy. Americans have over\nthe last 8 years been forced\nto ask questions about the\npurity and the future of\ntheir democracy. The 2000\nelection increased political cynicism. 9/11 brought\nwith it the spectres of\ntorture, increased security and lost\nrights. Hurricane Katrina exposed a\ndivided America and made a mockery\nof the government\u2019s ability to uphold\nits duties to its citizens; \u2018were black\nAmericans still treated as second-class citizens?\u2019 we asked. For the past\n8 years Americans have been asked to\ncontemplate their decline to an undemocratic and totalitarian state.\nAt the inauguration, we witnessed a\npeaceful and stable transition of pow-er. Something that seems simple but\nthat still in this day and age remains\nspecial. The success of democracy in\nAmerica and its ability to deliver the\nwill of the people was proven and with\nthe strong commandments of the new\nPresident, \u201cStarting today, we must\npick ourselves up, dust ourselves off,\nand begin again the work of remaking\nAmerica,\u201d the mistakes of the past did\nseem less important than the bountiful promise of the future.\nLess important too were the divisions between Republican and Democrat, Conservative and Liberal, or\nObama and McCain supporters. Of\ncourse, these distinctions did exist\nbut they were not public. Democrats\ndid not boast to me that they now\ncontrolled the American executive\nand legislative power and Republicans were not begrudging in their\ncelebrations. On inauguration eve, a\nMcCain supporter was being verbally\nabused by an over-zealous Democrat\nas a \u201credneck\u201d. A baying liberal mob\ndid not spring up, instead onlookers\njumped to his defence. Here was the\ntruth of Obama\u2019s 2004 convention speech, the material evidence of the fact that\nthere is not a liberal America\nand a conservative America\n\u2014 there is the United States\nof America. Obama has appealed to the best in Americans, he has called on them\nto work hard, to believe, to\nhope, to remember the ideals on which the country was\nfounded. And Americans of\nall colours have responded\nby uniting with pride in their\nnation.\nThis inauguration, howev-er, was momentous not only because\nObama is the first black President and\nnot only because of the unifying rhetoric and actions of the Commanderin-Chief. The inauguration was truly\nhistoric because it marks an era of\nstruggle for the American people that\nthreatens their way of life but also\nholds infinite potential.\nThis is the struggle to renew America\u2019s place at the forefront of the world\nculturally, politically and economical-ly. It will require the upgrade of infra-structure, increased quality of learn-ing, the creation of a green economy\nand the healing of America\u2019s cultural\nand political divisions. This is the\nstruggle to preserve America\u2019s moral\nleadership and its government\u2019s credibility both at home and abroad.\nIn front of a 1.8 million strong crowd,\nObama laid out the means by which\nAmerica would engage in this struggle and he left us in no doubt of the\noutcome. This generation has a duty\nto carry forth the great gift of freedom\nto future generations, Obama told us,\nand that neither terrorists, nor cyn-ics, nor the stale political arguments\nof right versus left would prevent\nAmerica from rising to the challenge\nwith pride, tolerance and strength.

The\ninternational community is worried,\nagain. People are arguing, again. And\nall the while, innocent people are getting killed. Again.\nUsually the things you see or read\nabout the conflict are full of emotionally tainted depictions of the politics or\nthe history behind the war, but luckily for you, this isn\u2019t one of them. This\nsection is not concerned with the correctness of any side or who has a right\nto the land or any of the politics; this\nsection is concerned with the economic context of the conflict and nothing\nmore. So without further ado, it\u2019s time\nto start following the money.\nThe US\nOne of the largest and most documented financial streams into the conflict\ncomes from the U.S. and thanks to the\ntransparency of their government you\ncan just look up how much it spends\non the USAID website.\nU.S. to Israel\nOf the $8.9bn the US deployed in international AID about $2.4bn was\ndirectly given to Israel [USAID 2008\nfinancial reports] with \u201cvirtually all\u201d\nof the money to be spent on weapons\n(up to 75% of which are U.S. produced)\n[Parade, December 14th 2008]. And\nover the next 10 years the U.S. government plans to donate $30bn to Israel,\npresumably mostly for weapons.\nOn top of the direct funding, the U.S.\ngovernment has guaranteed almost\n$12.5bn of Israeli loans, meaning that\nit will contribute $12.5bn to help Israel\npay off pay off loans to third parties\nshould it need to.\nU.S. to Egypt\nIn 2008 the U.S. gave $1.7bn of aid to\nEgypt, $1.3bn of which was earmarked\nto military budgets. It is not clear how\nmuch of this money has to be spent on\nU.S. produced weapons but USAID\nhas definitely led to Egypt being the\nonly military power in the region that\nis comparable to Israel. The budget is\nsupposed to allow Egypt to combat\nweapons smuggling to the Gaza strip\nbut considering that Egypt ranks 115th\nof 180 in the 2008 Corruption Index\nit\u2019s conceivable that a residual amount\nof the U.S. aid to go into arming Palestinian fighters.\nU.S. to Jordan\nJordan receives $688 million of U.S.\nAid, $326m of which goes to \u201cfighting\nterrorism\u201d and $163m goes to unspecified causes. It is unlikely that any large\namount of this money gets to Gaza, especially given that Jordan is a relatively\nuncorrupt country (ranking 47) and it\u2019s\nideological differences with Hamas.\nIsrael, Jordan and Egypt to the\nU.S.\nSo why is the US pouring so much into\nthe conflict? Usually people assume it\u2019s\nfor political gain, but America benefits\nfiscally too. If we look at the Aid figures it\u2019s pretty clear that a lot of \u201cforeign\u201d aid money never actually leaves\nthe U.S and the vast majority of it goes\nstraight to private American companies that produce weapons or aid\nproducts, which get sent to unstable\nregions. An absurd amount of USAID\nis turned into government subsidies\nfor the U.S. weapons and agricultural\nindustries. For these corporations it is\nbeneficial for the conflict in the Middle\nEast to continue for as long as possible.\nThere are entire weapons ranges based\naround the conflict with tanks specifically designed for fighting in the 139 sq\nmiles strip and guns like the Uzi being\ncrafted for no other purpose than to\nfight in the Palestinian territories.\nOther flows into the region\nFrom hereonin cash flows are much\nsmaller and much more difficult to pin\ndown. European governments do donate to the region but are scrutinized\nfar less by the press making reporting\ndifficult. Even less transparent are governments like China and Russia who\nare also suspected of adding funds to\nthe conflict but are almost impossible to trace accurately. Nevertheless\nit is widely accepted that official non-U.S. bodies provide relatively small\namounts to the region.\nArab states to Hamas\nIt is estimated that Hamas has an annual budget of about $70m [The Council of Foreign Relations] with about half\ncoming from Saudi Arabia. The US\nState department has claimed that Iran\nand Syria provide the rest of the groups\nfunding and The Graduate Institute of\nGeneva has also identified Bahrain,\nKuwait, Oman, Qatar, and the United\nArab Emirates to be donors.\nPrivate Benefactors to Hamas\nHamas\u2019 provision of social welfare and\neducation has enabled it to market\nitself as a charity to private benefactors across the globe and it receives\nconsiderable funding from Palestinian expatriates and others around the\nglobe, with notable cash streams flowing from Europe. Several sources have\nstated that donations from individuals\nare not used as part of the war effort\nbut these reports are of course difficult\nto verify.\nHamas to Arms Traders\nSeveral groups have stated that Hamas\u2019\nwar budget is about least $3m, but possibly runs slightly higher. While this\nmay not seem much, because of the nature of the way Hamas fights, relatively\nlow funds can still be devastating. This\nmoney is spent on cheap weapons, ammunition and other militaristic materials to support its campaign against\nIsrael\u2019s sovereignty. Because it is considered a terrorist group by most of\nthe international community it does\nnot purchase supplies openly and must\nresort to private arms traders. This\nhas led to Hamas using Chinese made\nrockets in attacks and a mixture of\nsmall arms from around the world.\nAid\nAid is almost invariably sent to the civilian population of Gaza after a conflict where civilians have been involved.\nThe UK has responded to the crisis\nwith $37m of aid to Gaza and the international community has stepped up\nto help the civilian population recover,\nincluding Israel. It is a curious fundamental of the relationship between the\ntwo countries that (out of necessity)\nGazan casualties are received in Israeli\nhospitals.\nBut as is the case with weapons, aid\nis also often used as a means of laundering money from governments to\nprivate companies. The difference,\nhowever, is that aid usually has a stabilizing effect on troubled regions.\nSo what does it all mean?\nHopefully, this article will not have\nchanged your political views on the\nconflict, but will have underlined that\nthe conflict goes far beyond Gaza.\nAs with all wars in today\u2019s globalized\nworld, Gaza creates economic ripples\nthat reach people all over the planet\nand implicate us all. Money flows\nthrough this conflict and washes it\u2019s\nway back to us. It\u2019s important not to\nforget that the UK is one of the largest\narms dealers in the world and that the\nweapons we produce are being used in\nthe Middle East to kill civilians.\nGaza (like all conflicts) has ben-efactors. There are large numbers of\npeople all over the world that depend\non the Gazan conflict for their livelihoods and will take any news of peace\nand progress as bad news; People who\nprofit from the continued pain of innocents in the Israel-Palestine arena.\nAnd if these people happen to be in\npositions of power over the conflict,\nthen the troubles of the Middle East\nwill continue far beyond their political lifetime. Perhaps they already have.\nAnd if that\u2019s the case, then perhaps we\nshould stop trying to look for wrongful parties on either side of lines in the\nsand, where people have done terrible\nthings for their beliefs, but in boardrooms and offices, where people have\ndone terrible things for a profit.\nI\nn the current economic situa-tion, people are going to have\nto learn to cut back and keep an\neye on their cash flows. As a student you have to do this anyway,\nbut to help you on your way felix has\nput together a little guide to set you off\nin the right direction.\n1. Budget.\nBudgeting is the most effective way\nof keeping on top of things. Just sit\ndown, and work out exactly how much\nmoney you will have to spend each\nmonth (take all you incoming cash for\nthe year and split it evenly between all\nthe months of term). Then for each\nmonth, deduct rent, tuition fees and\nother essentials bills. Then deduct 10%\nof the remainder to give you a rainy\nday cushion \u2013 do not touch this money\nunless you have to. What you have left\nover is how much you can spend per\nmonth on variable expenses like food,\nclothes and going out. Once you know\nthis figure, you\u2019ve pretty much fought\nhalf the battle \u2013 the other half is sticking to it.\n2. Second Accounts.\nA good way to make sure you stick\nto your budget is to set up a second\nbank account and have your \u201cbudget\u201d\ntransferred to that account at the start\nof each month.\nSo you have two accounts, one with\nthe bulk of your cash that gets spent\non core expenditure, like fees, bills,\nrent and the like and that your loan\ngets paid into. Then you have a second\naccount that all your food, going out\nand other random expenses get paid\nfrom each month. To do that just set\nup a \u201cstanding order\u201d for the amount\nyou budgeted to be sent to your second\naccount.\nSo when you get cash out of the machine you know exactly how much you\nhave to last the end of the month and\nhow close you are to keeping on top of\nthings. If you\u2019re spending too quickly,\njust cut back on luxuries till the end of\nthe month.\n3. Exploit your student status.\nAlways, always, always ask for a student discount. Don\u2019t be embarrassed\nor weird about it, just do it. The worst\nthat can happen is you pay the same\nprice you were about to pay anyway.\nWe don\u2019t count as NUS students so\nyou\u2019ll have to turn on the charm with\nstaff at McDonalds if you want your\nfree hamburger.\nMake sure you register for student\nsites like studentbeans.com and check\nthem for student deals. You\u2019d be surprised at how much you can get.\n4. Flirt with barstaff.\nBarstaff at clubs often charge you\nwhatever they think you\u2019ll pay for a\ndrink, or whatever the hell they feel\nlike charging you. If you flirt (without\ncoming across as creepy) you\u2019ll get\ncharged less. If you\u2019re particularly good\nat it you can get all kinds of discounts.\nI once went rock climbing for free off\nthe back of some expert flirting with\nthe receptionist.\n5. Freecycle.\nThere are lots of ways to freecycle,\nand almost all of them start with a\ngoogle search. You never know what\npeople are giving away till you look.\n6. Buy pre-loved stuff.\nGumtree.com and Craigslist.co.uk\nare the bread and butter of pre-owned\nstuff. You can get all kids of stuff here\n\u2013 cheap. And as an added bonus both\nsites have \u201cfor free\u201d sections where\npeople just give things away.\n7. Live like a real Londoner.\nLondon is one of the most expensive\ncities in the world and average Londoners don\u2019t go to all the expensive places.\nFind cheaper things to do. Better yet\nfind free stuff to do. Just google \u201cfree in\nLondon\u201d and you\u2019re away.\n8. Recycle properly.\nFact: Everything has more than one\nuse. If you cannot find an alternative\nuse, you aren\u2019t thinking hard enough.\nGet creative. I once fixed my shower\nusing pieces from my old guitar and no\none has ever noticed. I know a guy who\nbuilt a table out of old phonebooks and\nsome plywood \u2013 and it\u2019s the greatest\ntable ever. I once found a guitar in the\nstreet lying on a pile of rubbish and\nafter a clean and some new strings it\nsounds gorgeous. Keep your eyes open\nand your brain in gear and the world\u2019s\nyour oyster, as well as the rest of the\nseafood platter.\n8 Tips for getting\nthrough the\nCredit Crunch\n15\nFriday 23 January 2009 felix\nfilm.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFilm\nFilm Editors \u2013 Zuzanna Blaszczak and Jonathan Dakin\nPure optimism and buoyancy captured on film\nSlumdog Millionaire HHHHH\nDirector: Danny Boyle\nWriter: Simon Beaufoy\nCast: Dev Patel\nFreida Pinto,\nAnil Kapoor\nPriya Garg\nI absolutely love this film. From the\nfirst minutes to the last seconds, it was\nbreathtakingly beautiful and heartbreaking atthesametime.DannyBoyle\nmanages to capture the hectic chaos,\nnoise, dirt, colour, vibrancy, dark and\nlight of a Mumbai slum alongside the\nscenic beauty of modern India.\nJamal\u2019s colourful story is shadowed\nby poverty and the grimy underbelly\nof gangsters and guns which accompany him from a very early age. But\nthe director makes sure that positivity\nalways manages to shine through the\nunspeakably terrible things portrayed.\nThroughout his life Jamal\u2019s love for\nLatika, the slum girl we see huddled\nin a puddle during a thunderstorm,\nbrings him through whatever happens,\ndriving him to seek her out and draw\nthem back together.\nThe Millionaire premise, although it\nsounds ridiculous, is what opens and\ncloses the film so like a book, the film\nis open and shut with the same feelings\nand thoughts \u2013 that happiness and love\ncan push you through any despair. In\nwatching this, any day-to-day sadness\nyou may feel is infinitely superseded\nby the misery that Jamal and his companions have to go through. It is their\nyouthful outlook to never let anything\nget them upset which makes them so\namazing and reminds you that in the\nWestern world, we are incredibly self-centred and over-concerned with what\nis trivial, always greedy for more when\npeople with nothing have the ability to\nlive each day content with the small\nthings.\nDev Patel does a great job as the\nolder Jamal, the \u2018chai\u2013walla\u2019 reflecting\non his life from a toddler to a teenager in hardship and struggle, to being\nthe richest slum-dog in India. Truly\nthough, it is the performances by the\nreal-life street-kids, young Jamal, Salim\nand Latika, who really steal the show.\nThey are outstandingly believable and\nit simply feels like you are an outside\nobserver dropping in on their lives in\nthe middle of a crowded dusty street in\nIndia, rather than viewing a polished\nfilm script.\nIcannotrecommendthisfilmenough.\nThe soundtrack gives me goosebumps\nand the trailer brings tears to my eyes.\nIf you enjoyed City of God, you will love\nSlumdog Millionaire. A secret venture\ninto the lives of people that we don\u2019t\nhear about enough, portrayed by those\nwho seem more real than any of the\nother actors and actresses in the Hollywood blockbusters around. Worthy of\nall the hype and nominations, this film\nwill exceed your expectations, leaving\nyou touched and in awe.\nIf you want a true taste of India,\nmake sure you catch this outstanding piece of cinematography before it\nleaves the screens to be replaced by the\nusual blockbuster drivel.\nDev Patel as Jamal and Freida Pinto as Latika give solid performances; is this the beginning of new careers?\nThe director who brought us Trainspotting and 28 Days Later ups his game by a notch to deliver a\nmovie that has achieved the impossible \u2013 it has got the critics and the audience raving simultaneously.\nIt\u2019s been a bittersweet time for comebacks in the last few years, with two\ntough guy legends putting their careers\nback in front of the camera for nostalgically redemptive efforts in Rocky\nBalboa and JCVD. However, both Sylvester Stallone and Jean Claude Van\nDamme have always had a healthy\nfollowing and their movies generally\nboasted an unhealthy number of sequels or clones. The same cannot be\nsaid of Mickey Rourke, a genuine has-been, whose career just might have\nreignited following his performance\nin Darren Aronofsky\u2019s film. Moreover,\nthe load of awards garnered in the last\nfew months, including a Golden Globe\nfor Best Actor in a Motion Picture Drama, have put Rourke in pole-position\nfor an Academy Award in next month\u2019s\nHollywood showdown.\nThe Wrestler tells the story of \u201can\nold, broken down piece of meat of\na man\u201d, Randy \u201cThe Ram\u201d Robinson\n(Rourke), a fighter past his prime who\nlives alone in a trailer, estranged from\nhis daughter and works part-time in a\ngrocery store during the week whilst\nspending his weekends wrestling and\nsigning autographs. Ironically, most of\nthe money he earns goes on all sorts of\nmedications which allow him to keep\nwrestling, leaving him little time for\nanything else. His only social contact is\nan exotic dancer in her forties, Cassidy\n(Marisa Tomei), a character in a similar\npredicament to Randy\u2019s, which brings\nthe two together. After summarily\npainting this background to the film,\nan offer for a rematch with his former\n\u201carch-enemy\u201d puts things into motion\nand Randy\u2019s life seems to be finally going somewhere as the film begins to\nunfold into a gritty tale of sorrow.\nWhilst Rourke\u2019s performance is the\nunrivalled centre-piece in the pic-ture, the fairly bleak atmosphere and\nrollercoaster-like ride of emotions are\ntrademarks of Aronofsky, as showcased in Pi (1998) and Requiem for a\nDream (2000). The themes of solitude\nThe Wrestler HHHKK\nDirector: Darren Aronofsky\nWriter: Robert D. Siegel\nCast: Mickey Rourke\nMarisa Tomei\nEvan Rachel Wood\nStefan Carpanu\nIn accordance with new EU fishing\nquotas, this week we take a short peak\ninto the exotic jungle of World Cinema. Will it be a plethora of rare and\nendangered species, driven to extinction by the Hollywood bulldozer? Or\nsimply another collection of contrived\nmetaphors and personification? Let\nthe planets decide!\nAccording to Wackipedia, the term\n\u201cWorld Cinema\u201d generally refers to\nnon\u2013English speaking films, those\noutside \u201cthe anglosphere\u201d. That\u2019s Anglosphere, not to be confused with Anglersphere \u2013 which is essentially a giant\nhamster ball for fishermen. It\u2019s always a\npleasure to see how the English-speaking community can set itself apart, as\nthough there is something amazingly\ndifferent between it and everyone else.\nIn Germany for example, they don\u2019t refer to South Park: The Movie as World\nCinema, simply because it wasn\u2019t originally in German.\nBut that aside, what does World Cinema actually mean? Some interpret it\nto be simply \u201carty-farty foreign films\u201d,\nothers as a masterclass in martial arts,\nand some see it as an excuse to watch\nblood drenched shockers \u2013 think Battle Royal. Whilst this unfairly excludes\nthe majority of cinema, there is some\ntruth in these examples with each displaying some tell-tell traits. If you\u2019ve\never sat down to watch a film and wondered why the director decided to tape\na Quality Street wrapper over the camera lens, then you may well be watching an arty-farty film. Presumably this\nstyle adds a certain \u201cdynamic quality\u201d\nthat can\u2019t be achieved with those silly\nplain glass lenses.\nIf the film excessively uses wire-work and complex choreographed se-quences, then you are almost certainly\nwatching Crouching House of Hidden\nFlying Dragon Tigers. If the character\u2019s\nhead is missing, then it\u2019s definitely Battle Royal. If all of the main characters\u2019\nperformances are lacking in dimension\nand the actors only have four fingers,\nthen you\u2019re probably watching The\nSimpsons Movie again. Not that The\nSimpsons Movie could possibly be considered World Cinema \u2013 it is far too\npopular for a specialist label.\nFor an English-speaker, unexposed\nand fresh to the concept of subtitles,\nforeign cinema could be the antidote to\nsome Hollywood\u2019s not-so-great works,\nshowing us that films don\u2019t have to be\nlike Dumb and Dumberer. Of course\nthere\u2019s a lot of crap out there as well,\neven the film industry isn\u2019t immune to\nstatistical fluctuations but occasionally\nyou come across those Crunchy Nutflakes of wholesome goodness that satisfy the aching hole left by Hollywood\nHappy Meals (although in this metaphor\n\u2018Supersize Me\u2019 becomes an intractable\nparadox...).\nI would recommend if you haven\u2019t already seen it and you don\u2019t mind insensitive gore, watching Battle Royal. It\u2019s a\nsurreal film based upon a very surreal\npremise. Who knows, it might lead you\nto a ground-breaking epiphany about\nhumanity and the world. Even if it\u2019s\njust realising that there are people out\nthere who are dreaming this stuff up.\nWeird.\nAnyone got any comments? Ah who\nam I kidding, no one has bothered\nwriting in yet.\nFinally a drama for real men\nStuart Higgins\nand loss, which are also central in his\nprevious works, transform the world of\nThe Wrestler into familiar turf for the\nNew York-born director but the question which permeates the film asks\nwhat is real and what confers purpose\nto one\u2019s life? Wrestling, as a mix of illusion and glory, represents an ideal\nscene for such a question and Randy\nan appropriately fleshed-out character\nto draw the lines.\nThe film ultimately builds up to an\nimpressive finale which is poised to\ngive birth to mixed feelings and a sense\nof reflection to its merits and its mean-ings. Whichever the case maybe, as the\nlights came back on, I felt a moment of\nsatisfaction pass fleetingly by me, just\nlike a subtle nudge to better endings.\nFilm Cynic Clinic\nMickey Rourke, as Randy \u201cThe Ram\u201d Robinson, goes airborne.\n\n"

My racial stereotype\nwas not intended as derogatory.\nI am descended from one of the\n12 tribes myself and my column was\nwritten in defence of Israel. I assumed\nthat in context and with the use of the\nterm \u201cfriends\u201d, it would be obvious that\nit was meant as a joke; in bad taste,\nperhaps, but still inoffensive.\nI am now aware that for such a tricky\ntopic I should not have used such hu-mour, but if you can\u2019t laugh at times\nlike this, what can you do? When I next\nuse a stereotype I shall ensure it is obviously tongue-in-cheek.\nHowever, this is only a student news-paper, no matter how good or how\nprofessionally we take it.\nA couple of errors were also pointed\nout from last week\u2019s issue and I apologise for these as well. The photograph\nof a \u2018tank heading into Gaza\u2019 was not in\nfact Israeli \u2013 which any self-respecting\ntank expert would know. Imagine a different tank rolling into Gaza and there\nyou have it.\nNow that I have grovelled enough, I\nshall turn my attention to the Inauguration of Barack Obama. Almost 2 million people flocked to see the Founding\nFathers spinning in their graves.\nI am all for change, progress, democracy (despite its problems, a topic\nfor another day perhaps) and Obama.\nIf he had not won I would have been\ndevastated.\nHowever, my problem is more with\nKatya-yani Vyas\nPolitics Editor\nGaza\u2019s skyline illuminated by fire and smoke from Israeli bombs\nJames Goldsack\nPolitics Editor\nthe nature of presidency in the US.\nThe Founding Fathers, whose names\nare always brought up at occasions\nsuch as these had struggled to create\na nation not under God but of secular\ngovernance with faith separated from\nstate.\nAt the inauguration, what did Obama\nhave to swear the oath upon? Yes, a\nBible. What was the most common\nphrase to be spoken during the whole\naddress? \u201cGod bless the United States\nof America\u201d.\nIt made me cringe.\nThe original vision of secularity is a\nfar cry from today where the presidential candidates have to be Christian to\nget any support, and where dollar bills\nhave religious slogans plastered over\nthem.\nWhat has happened to the principles\nof the fathers of democracy and the\nland of the free?\nThis is not the only problem I have\nwith the presidency as a concept.\nPresidents now have too much\npower, far more than allowed by their\nmuch-loved constitution. The checks\nand balances originally found in the\nsystem are no longer there. A president was supposed to be for use in\nsituations where rapid response is nec-essary, when a parliament could not\nmove fast enough.\nThis is one of the reasons why the US\nsystem is a corruption. They fight corruption elsewhere in the world but fail\nto look in their own administration to\nfind the real criminals.\nI am very\nsorry...\nIsrael withdraws\nObama\u2019s inauguration and the media frenzy\nThe inauguration of Obama paves the way for the glorifcation of freedom of speech\n\u201cA sporadic peace\u201d was the phrase\nbeing thrown around by commentators after Israel declared a complete\nwithdrawal of its troops from Gaza.\nThis comes after a three-week assault\nagainst Hamas militants and could be\na stepping-stone towards some kind of\nresolution. Israeli troops will remain\nnear the border as a strategic measure\nin order to prevent any further attacks,\nspy planes continue to fly over the area\nand the navy have not ceased the random bombing of Gaza\u2019s beaches.\nThe withdrawal happened early on\nWednesday, with an Israeli military\nspokesman telling the media; \"The last\nof the Israel Defence Force\u2019s soldiers\nhave left the Gaza Strip, forces have\nbeen deployed outside of Gaza and are\nprepared for any occurrences.\" A statement that was a reaction to reports that\nthe Israeli navy has continued to fire\nshells at Gaza from the Mediterranean,\nin what the military has described as a\ndeterrent measure. The last armoured\nunits and foot patrols left three days\nafter Israel and Hamas separately declared ceasefires on Sunday. Officials\nhad promised that they would have\nvacated the area before the inauguration of the new US president, Barack\nObama.\nThe reasons for this are no doubt\ncentred around Israel\u2019s desire to avoid\npossible tension at the start of a new\nera of diplomacy with its closest military ally. George Bush, Obama\u2019s pred-ecessor, endorsed Israel's right to enter\nthe Gaza Strip in its efforts to defend\nitself against rocket fire from Hamas\nmilitants, providing Israel with the\nconfidence to carry out military meas-ures. The pressing question is, how\nwill the new president act to resolve\nthe situation? It expected that Obama\nwill move quickly to appoint a Middle\nEast envoy, possibly the former senator\nGeorge Mitchell, who, on behalf of the\nClinton and Bush administrations, was\na key figure in trying to bring about an\nend to Israeli-Palestinian violence.\nAround 1,300 Palestinians have\nkilled and thousands made homeless\nsince the 22-day long offensive be-gan. Medical officials in Gaza stated\nthat the Palestinian dead includes at\nleast 700 civilians. Ten Israeli soldiers\nand three civilians hit by cross-border\nrocket fire were killed in the conflict.\nIt is this contrast in the numbers of\ncasualties on either side that has provoked an upsurge in outrage against\nIsrael\u2019s military actions. Recently there\nhave been protests around the Israeli\nembassy in Kensington, and a 24 hour\nvigil was held on High Street Kensington to remember those that had died\nin Gaza.\nDuring the 24 hour vigil, a smaller\nprotest was also underway nearby.\nHaving attended the event myself as an\nobserver, it was difficult to make out\nmuch of what was being said amongst\nthe sea of frantically swaying placards\nand aggressive chanting. I did however\nnotice a sign that appealed to us to\n\u201cStop the Holocaust in Gaza\u201d, showing\na distinct lack of taste, in addition a car\ndrove by bearing the phrase \u201cKill all the\nJews\u201d. It became increasingly evident\nthat this particular protest had become\nless about politics and more about cultural fanaticism. Whilst attempting to\ngain some sort of coherent perspective\nfrom one protester I was subjected to a\ntorrent of aggression and rogue saliva,\nI was called \u2018an imperialist warmonger\u2019\nand most amusingly, accused of being\nin league with \u2018the Zionists\u2019, a response\nto my asking what the main reasons for\ntheir protest were: a slight over-reac-tion, perhaps.\nIt seems that the situation is moving forward, Hamas having stated that\nprogress is being made with continuing\ntalks in Cairo over Egypt's proposal for\na deal that would guarantee that Gaza\u2019s\nborder crossings be re-opened, including a terminal on the Egyptian frontier\nthat had served as the main exit from\nthe territory. So is peace on the hori-zon? I sincerely hope so.\nRaz Jabary\nWith Barack Obama\u2019s inauguration\nas America\u2019s 44th President let us all\nbriefly think back to the modern democratic developments in the Western\nworld in the past century, those that\nhave now resulted in the election of\na citizen from a minority race to the\nhighest office of the most powerful\ncountry in the world.\nWhen having lived in this country\nfor a while, one occasionally tends to\nforget how blessed we are to live in\nsuch advanced economic, political and\ncultural circumstances.\nIt was the media that changed people\u2019s perceptions in the past about major issues and that gave a substantial\nstimulus to the power of public opin-ion. It is the media today that delivers\nevents around the world straight to our\nliving rooms and it will be the media in\nthe future that will prevent people such\nas the recently re-sentenced Chemical\nAli to get away with the cruellest acts\nagainst humanity.\nLike the freedom of expression, one\ndoes not tend to respect the role of the\nmedia unless one looks back at what\nwas going on in a time of insufficient\nreport coverage. Would the American\npublic have fully supported America\u2019s\nprevious wars if they had been televised like the conflict in Vietnam?\nWould the Holocaust have been such\ndisastrous if people in every corner of\nthe world were able to follow live coverage on the suffering that the Jewish\ncommunity had to go through in Nazi\nGermany?\nUnfortunately, the media has often\nbeen victimized in widespread acts of\npropaganda in various former and ongoing conflicts around the world. This\nemphasizes the necessity for us here in\nBritain to optimally utilize the opportunity to say what we think, to be critical of what we are told and mostly to\nset the example to regimes that harshly\nredeem lobbying opportunities for\ntheir own populations.\nLet us all spare a brief moment to\nthink about the many means of written\ncommunication that exist today and\nthat have at some stage been a benefit\nto each one of us, from the university\nprospectuses that you consulted when\nyou were in sixth form to that crucial\nBBC report that changed your view of\nthe world in which we live.\nThe development of the media as a\ntool of indirect communication has\nincreased lateral understanding and\nbrought humans from different ethnicity and religions, different traces and\nnationalities all closer together. Let us\nbe thankful for that.\npolitics.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n13\nFriday 23 January 2009 felix\nPolitics\nObama\u2019s inauguration and first days in office\nBarack Obama opened his inaugural\naddress by telling the country of the crisis it has fallen into, that of \u201cgathering\nclouds and raging storms.\u201d President\nObama said that the economic crisis\nwas not only a result of \u201cgreed and irresponsibility on the part of some,\u201d but\ninstead a consequence of \u201cour collective failure to make hard choices and\nprepare the nation for a new age.\u201d\nThose in the United States have been\nhankering for lower taxes yet greater\nservices, an impossible task. Obama\nis showing a new side, a break from\nthis politics: \u201cOur time of standing\npat, or protecting narrow interests and\nputting off unpleasant decisions - that\ntime has surely passed\u201d.\nObama\u2019s first speech as president\nshowed that he is determined to attempt to create a new kind of politics\nfor a \u201cpost-partisan\u201d America. This\nidea is not necessarily going to sit well\nwith those in the Democratic party\nwho wish for a cleaner break from the\nBush presidency and the painful times\nthat came with it.\n\u201cOn this day, we come to proclaim\nan end to the petty grievances and\nfalse promises, the recriminations and\nworn-out dogmas, that for far too long\nhave strangled our politics.\u201d\nThe speech also contained a similarly blunt message to the world. \u201cTo\nthe Muslim world, we seek a new way\nforward, based on mutual interest and\nmutual respect,\u201d he said.\nObama challenged the regimes of the\nMiddle East to a new test: \u201cKnow that\nyour people will judge you on what you\ncan build, not what you destroy.\u201d He\nalso offered a path out of corruption\nfor those nations or oligarchs willing to\nchange: \u201cWe will extend a hand if you\nare willing to unclench your fist.\u201d However, unlike the Bush administration\u2019s\ninsistent promotion of democracy,\nPresident Obama has a hard term ahead with the financial crisis and the war on terror to contend with\nThe Capitol building, where Obama was sworn in as the 44th President of the United States of America in front of 2 million spectators\npresident Obama appears to be taking\na gentler approach.\nAlso in the inauguration speech,\nObama said that \u201cFor those who seek\nto advance their aims by inducing terror and slaughtering innocents, we say\nto you now that our spirit is stronger\nand cannot be broken; you cannot outlast us, and we will defeat you\u201d, helping\nto evade fears that America will now\nappear weak in the face of terrorism.\nObamahasbeenlikenedtomanyprevious presidents, such as Kennedy and\nLincoln. His speech was akin to those\nof early American presidents, plain\nbut bold. \u201cWhat the cynics fail to understand is that the ground has shifted\nbeneath them - that the stale political\narguments that have consumed us for\nso long no longer apply.\u201d\nAfter the celebrations of inauguration night, President Obama was\nlaunched immediately into the reality\nof his new job. His first task was to call\nthe leaders of Middle Eastern countries including Egypt, Israel and the\nPalestinian Authority.\nThe president has pledged \u201cactive\nengagement\u201d for a fragile cease-fire\nbetween Israel and the Palestinians in\nGaza.\n\u201cIn the aftermath of the Gaza con-flict, he emphasized his determination to work to help consolidate the\ncease-fire by establishing an effective\nanti-smuggling regime to prevent Hamas from re-arming, and facilitating in\npartnership with the Palestinian Authority a major reconstruction effort\nfor Palestinians in Gaza,\u201d press secretary Robert Gibbs said in a statement.\nObama\u2019s first presidential meetings\nconcerned the economy and Iraq and\nlater signed a series of executive orders\nand directives to implement new ethical rules for his administration, keeping\nhis campaign promise to bring greater\ntransparency to the White House and\ndeclaring \u201ca new era of openness\u201d in\ngovernment.\nThe Senate voted 94 to 2 to confirm\nObama\u2019s nominee for secretary of\nstate, Hillary Clinton, allowing her to\nbegin work on foreign policy issues including the conflict in Gaza. Presidential aides are preparing an executive\norder to begin the process of shutting\ndown the Guantanamo Bay detention\nfacility in Cuba. The Obama administration has instructed military prosecutors to seek a 120 day suspension\nof legal proceedings including those\nagainst Khalid Sheik Mohammed, the\navowed mastermind of the September\n11th attacks. In an appearance at the\nEisenhower Executive Office Building,\nObama signed further executive orders\nto tighten rules on lobbyists, freeze the\npay of senior White House staff and\nexpand release of documents under\nthe Freedom of Information Act.\n\u201cTransparency and the rule of law\nwill be the touchstones of this presidency,\u201d Obama told senior staff mem-bers. The orders \u201cwill not by themselves make government as honest and\ntransparent as it needs to be,\u201d he said.\n\u201cAnd they do not go as far as we need\nto go towards restoring accountability\nand fiscal restraint in Washington. But\nthese historic measures do mark the\nbeginning of a new era of openness in\nour country.\u201d\n\u201cWhat a moment we\u2019re in. What an\nopportunity we have to change this\ncountry,\u201d Obama told members of his\nsenior executive staff.\nLawmakers grilled Obama\u2019s nominee for Treasury secretary, Timothy\nGeithner, who came under criticism\nwhen it was revealed that he had\nfailed to pay some taxes for four years.\nGeithner acknowledged making the\nerrors and apologized to lawmakers\nfor making them spend time discussing his taxes. However, he spent the\nbulk of his confirmation hearing warning about the need to act boldly to confront the country\u2019s enormous financial\ncrisis.\n\u201cIf our policy response is tentative and incrementalist... then we risk\ngreater damage to living standards, to\nthe economy\u2019s productive potential,\nand to the fabric of our financial system,\u201d he said.\nObama is planning a major address\nto a joint session of Congress within\nthe next few weeks in order to lay out\nhis plans for reviving the economy and\njump-starting the financial system.\nUpon entering the White House,\nPresident Obama read a note that\nformer president George W. Bush had\nleft for him in the left desk drawer, a\ntradition dating back several presi-dents. The note was in an envelope\nmarked \u201cTo: #44, From: #43,\u201d according to a statement from the President\u2019s\npress secretary. The White House did\nnot disclose the contents of the note.\nJames Goldsack\nPolitics Editor\n\n"
