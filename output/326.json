Today sees the start of I.C.'s buildup to the big London demonstration on February21. The next week must be one of great activity in preparation for our own I.C.d emoto the DES on February7 to deliver the masses of letters which should be flooding in from today. Every student should be contacted and asked to contribute to the write in. If your Departmental Representative isn't doing the job then take the letters round your class or lab yourself and get them involved. Explain the issues \u2014 the constant drop in value of the grant, the unfairness of the means test, the miserable grant which PG' s get. . . .\nIf you have any questions or suggestions come into the Union Office or ask someone on the Action Committee. Remember the mass write in/ demo suggestion came from the rank and file of this union \u2014 it's up to YOU to make it a success. REFECTORY BOYCOTTS After last Thursday's EG Mit looks very much as if the union will be launching a refectory boycott campaign from the U GM this Thursday as part of the national campaign for higher grants. We must ensure the quo racy of Thursday's meeting to get a decision taken. H.M. Government received the original NUS claim a year ago, and again last September. A fortnight ago with42 rent strikes on its hands, it finally got around to telling Digby Jacks\" informally\" that they would begetting around to\nsome preliminary discussions\" soon\". Our claim is just, as the Times Educational Supplement said aye arago:'N US case for higher grants is good. Certainly everyone else can moan about the effects of inflation, and the education system has been as hard hit as any; but there are not many who need a25 percent pay rise merely to bring them up to their1962 level'. The Vice Chancellors and Principals say we need more, but the Government has n't budged. We must bring every possible pressure to bear on them. They won't like\" trouble on the campus\" or constant nagging from Principals with rent strikes and refectory boycotts to deal with, or being faced with pickets and demonstrations wherever they go. Remember it is your decision at Thursday's U GM. MARTIN'S BIT on W ttt kt i It appears tome that cars, like elephants, when nearing the end of their days, go to the carpark behind L instead where it can end them in peace( pieces?). This area is not the motorcars' graveyard \u2014 it is somewhere where students can park their cars. Unless the owners of those wrecks, which are taking up valuable space, move them in the very near future, the Union will take steps to have them removed. on &WL\u00a7!>\nThe time is drawing night for the close of nominations for the next NUS conference in Exeter from2 nd6 th April \u2014 5 p.m. today is the closing time. on population The United Nations Office\nat Geneva will again be conducting a Graduate Study Programme this year, to beheld in Geneva from Tuesday, July17 until Friday, August3.I have a small supply of application forms which should be endorsed by the graduate's supervisor. Neither the College nor the Union have funds to \u2022 meet the travel costs or residential expenses of the participants. U. G.M.

Mr. Phillips proposed an amendment( Ion Paper B filed in the Minute Book). The President accepted this amendment. M r.A.E. Smith proposed an amendment( II on Paper B) which the President accepted.

After discussion the amendment was put to the vote in parts. The second part was rejected and the third retained. Mr. D. Brown proposed an amendment: Delete all and insert:\" ICU recognises and backs the campaign for higher grants. ICU also recognises that arent strike in this College would not achieve any useful purpose and only aggravate public opinion and therefore abandons any proposals for the same\". The Chairman invited Mr. Brown to speak in favour of his amendment. A member, on a point of order, submitted that the amendment was not a valid one and should not betaken at that time. The Chairman ruled that the amendment would be considered and Mr. Gibbons Tutorials Investigation\nOne of the topics discussed at this year's meetings of the Rector's Special Committee on Student Welfare has been the personal tutorial system. The committee has obtained( or is in the process of obtaining) statements from each department on departmental policy, and would like to supplement this information with comments and statements from students. We have therefore drawn up a brief questionnaire which will, we hope, be circulated to all third year undergraduates during the next few weeks. A copy of the questions appears below. Only if there is a good response to the questionnaire will we be able to conclude anything about the students' view of the personal tutorial system. I hope, therefore, that all third year undergraduates will fill in the questionnaires and return them to the relevant person in their dept., or tome in the Union Office.\nJENNY ROGERS I.C.U. Welfare Officer.\nSee also Page 3, Col.1 challenged the Chair. The Chairman immediately passed the Chair to Mr. Jo witt, who invited Mr. Gibbons to state his challenge. Mr. Black then replied and on a vote the Challenge was upheld. The Chairman returned the Chair to Mr. Black. Miss Hoch f elder asked if it was in order for a Chairman' who had been successfully challenged to continue. Mr. Jo witt explained that the Chairman' s ruling had been reversed by the meeting and that it was in order for Mr. Black to remain in the Chair. Mr. Everett proposed that Paragraph C of the Motion be replaced by:\" This Union demands an immediate increase of \u00a3100 p.a.in the Postgraduate grant, the restoration of the London Allowance and theN US Executive to give these two points equal priority with the four points in clause B\". Mr. Bann agha n proposed an amendment calling for a London Weighting but withdrew it in favour of Mr. Everett' s amendment which was adopted. Mr. Schm ett erling proposed an amendment deleting clause E and all references to a refusal to pay the NewHall Levy. After considerable discussion the amendment was carried. The Chairman adjourned the meeting to the following day, at2.30 p.m. \u2014\u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2014\nThe Chairman reopened the meeting at1.02 on Friday12 th January,1973. Approximately350 members were present. The Chairman explained that the motion as\namended had been reprinted and was being distributed. Mr. Gillett proposed an amendment: After\" the full grant for all who study\" line2, add\" further demands Supplementary Grants to be paid in cash each time the cost of living rises1 percent\". Delete all after\" ICU resolves on a two pronged campaign aiming,1.... living standards in these two points and add:2 That since the Tory Government does not respond to pressure this campaign must demand the immediate resignation of the Tory Government and the return of a Labour Government pledged to Socialist Policies as the only way of winning any increases\". After Mr. Gillett had spoken in favour of his amendment, the President spoke against. Mr. Gillett summed up and the amendment was defeated on a vote.

MINUTES OF AN EXTRAORDINARY GENERAL MEETING OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE UNION HELD IN THE GREAT HALL OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE ON THURSDAY, JANUARY28,1973 The President, who was in the Chair, opened the meeting at1.18 p.m.; about150 members were present.1. The President passed the Chair to the Deputy President and presented his report. President's Report The President reported that significant developments on the Grants claim by NUS had taken place.1. the claim would be increased to account for this year's inflation2. a \u00a3100 claim for postgraduates has been submitted3. an NUS DES working party on the means test has been set up. The campaign was proceeding very well with42 unions on rent strike throughout the country. The next stage was the buildup to regional demonstrations on February21 which must be a massive show of strength. Departmental meetings had been held in Chemistry, Che m.Eng., and Botany/ Zoology. The meeting in Physics was arranged. AP.G. group had met twice. The President said that the other dept. reps had not even bothered to contact him. The President asked for a grants action committee often to be setup and suggested: Mess rs. David Finn, Keith Nixon, Malcolm Newman, Miss Rosemary Park er, Miss Sonia Hoch fielder, Rob Armitage, Mike Silver leaf, John Porter, Alf Perry and T rev Phillips. President, Hon. Secretary, Deputy President will be member sex officio. This was accepted with Pete Gillett and Pete Lambert added to the list.\nPete Gillett reported that he was organising a Civil Engineering Dept. Meeting. It was agreed that if Dept Reps were doing nothing students should attempt to organise meetings themselves.2. Hon Secretary' s Business( i) The Secretary announced that theN US were organising a conference on\" Women in Employment\" on February15 at North London Polytechnic. He asked any interested people \u2014\nboth male and female \u2014 to see him after the meeting.( ii) As Returning Officer, Mr. Black declared Mr.T. Phillips elected unopposed as NUS Secretary, there being no other candidate.( iii) Mr. Black then read a letter from the two candidates for the post of PostGraduate Affairs Officer, in which they explained that Mr. John Porter had retired from the election as he had taken up a post on the Campaign Committee for Grants on the behalf of P.G.' s. The Returning Officer then declared Mr. R.M ounce elected unopposed.3. Motions Mr. Gillett proposed: Supplementary Grants\" In recent months prices of essentials such as food, rents and transport have risen faster than ever before. In the last two months alone prices rose by6 percent which is an annual rate of36 percent. This Union therefore demands Supplementary Grants as cash payments each time the cost of living rises. The rapid rate of inflation makes it essential for students to have more money now. September will be too late, many students will be faced with the choice of looking for jobs in exam time or going without proper food. Further, Heath's White Paper taken away any bargaining rights for grants as with wages. What is the purpose of a student union which cannot bargain or take any action for grant increases without facing stiff\npenalties and fines. This makes a grants campaign absolutely urgent and makes it clear that it must be linked to the demand to clear this reactionary Tory Government out of office.\nThis Union therefore resolves to:1. Campaign for Supplementary Grants linked to the demand to clear the Tory Government from office.\n2. Immediately elect from the Union Meeting an8 member action commit tee to organise the following campaign: A one day strike on Thursday, February8 and a demonstration in preparation for the day of action on February21. That in order to ensure the maximum possible support for the campaign the action committee must contact and work with London Region NUS and all student bodies, arrange speakers at meetings and organize meetings where student unions are weak or nonexistent. Further, contact local Trades Councils, Union Branches and shop stewards committees for support for the campaign.\" Mess rs. M ounce and Woo sey gave information and Miss Hoch f elder spoke against. There was a move to the vote which was carried. Mr. Gillett summed up and the motion was defeated overwhelmingly. Miss Hoch f elder proposed: The Union notes: i its decision to support the campaign for higher grants ii its support for any College on rent strike iii its lack of actions of ar in the grants campaign iv the various statements of the Vice Chancellors in support of higher grants. This Union considers: i that the best way of giving support to the Colleges on rent strike is to take action ourselves for the same aim... that the Vice Chancellors will press the Government even more firmly for higher grants if pressure is put on them by the students in the colleges. iii that putting pressure on the Vice Chancellors is the most important tactic we can use in conducting our campaign since we cannot put direct pressure on the Government but must fight where we are. iv that lightning boycotts of one canteen at a time is a method of putting such pressure on the College Authorities without inconveniencing the students. This Union therefore:1. Instructs its members to take part in one or more canteen boycotts starting next week( on Tue s., Jan.30) \u2014 the days to be decided by the campaign committee. The canteen to be boycotted will be decided by the commit tee at11.45 a.m.on the day of the boycott.\" Mr. Foot spoke against and Mr. Finn spoke for, Mr. Black gave information in a speech against, Mr. Corby n gave information. Mr. Smith proposed an amendment to alter the motion to read:\" This Union considers...2. That the Vice Chancellors and the Government will be pressed even more firmly for higher grants if action is taken in colleges.3. That taking action in the Colleges is the most important tactic we can use in conducting our campaign since we cannot put direct pressure on the Government but must fight where we are\". and to add at the end:\" Our relation with the College workers involved to be as for the rent strike motion.\" There was a move to the vote which was passed. A member challenged the quorum. The President closed the meeting at2.10. The President opened a\" Meeting of I.C. Students at2.10\". The Motion was put to the meeting and passed. The President closed the meeting of I.C. Students at2.15. "

    "content": "IMPERIAL COLLEGE\nSouth Kensington,\nLondon, S.W.I. Norman St-John Stevas, M.P. Under-Secretary of State,\nDepartment of Education and Science.\nDear\"Sir,\nAs a student of Imperial College, I wish to complain strongly about the\nfinancial situation that I and my fell aw students find ourselves in at the\nmoment.\nThe recent rapid rise in costs that students have to bear has not been matched\nby increases in grant levels, nor will they unless the Government decides to act.\nThis problem is worsened further by the fact that part of the grant is composed of\na parental contribution. Our parents because of financial and other reasons are\nunwilling to pay us the full contribution. This means test element has increased\nsharply in recent years and accordingly the amount most of us receive from our\nparents has gone down in real terms.\nThis is not the end of the matter. It is often assumed that all students receive\ngrants and at the full rate. Apart from the means test problem many students receive\nlower level grants because they are not on degree level courses. This is the worst\npart of all. We think that all students should receive a grant as a right.\nIf the Government wishes to expand higher and further education there can be no\nshort cuts. In particular the value of our grants must be maintained and\ndiscriminatory practices within the grants system removed. If this is not done not\nonly will we suffer, so will future generations of students and with them the\nwidening of access to higher and further education we wish to see.\nThe NUS is at present organising a campaign to pressure the Government into action.\nWe support the Union's claim for an end to discretionary awards: a raising of the\nmain rates of grant to counteract the erosion of value that inflation has caused;\na raising of the grants that married women students are at present eligible for and\nthe institution of a student cost index with an annual review of grants.\nStudents at I.C. feel particularly strongly that the parental contribution should\nend. This has led to an increasing proportion of the grant coming from our parents,\nmany of whom cannot afford it. We feel that the only just system is to pay the full grant to all who study.\nMany of my fellow students are post-graduates. They cannot work during the holidays\nand so cannot afford to get into debt. We are totally opposed to the introduction of\nloans for Post-Graduates and feel that the cost of living in London warrants the\nre-introduction of the London allowance.\nI am deeply disturbed that your Government has delayed for a whole year before\nreplying to the N.U.S. claim. I urge you to recognise that the widespread rent-strikes and refectory boycotts show deep feeling among students that the N.U.S. claim is just.\nI strongly urge you to concede it immediately.\nYours faithfully,\nDate\n\n"

Thoughts, Hopes\nand Dreams\nDo you think about your girlfriend over a cold Mooney, or when you're\nsitting shiny-trouser ed on your wooden laboratory stool like some quir rel who\nhas been disturbed long before his hibernation was due to end! Or later when\nyou're sipping a glass of distilled River Liffey in a quiet corner do you think\nof World Peace or your lost Freedom and how you'd like to be in California\nsipping orange juice-?\nOr do you wish that all this time you have to spend doing your job and what's required of you could be spent just dreaming instead of dreaming of that day\nwhen dreaming will come true and then the regrets that all good dreamers will\npass away'? And do you wish all day could be spent painting or singing or just\nreading someone else's poetry that expresses all you ever wanted to say but\nnever found the time; and that you wish you may get the wish you wish\ntonight....\nOr do you hope? Hope maybe that the wars will end, that Northern Ireland\nand Vienatn and Biafra and Guernica will never happen again, will never be\nable to happen again because we all hope the same as you? Or maybe just that\ntomorrow will be a good day, with the frightened eyes of a laboratory rat or\nthe alienation of a prisoner.\nAnd do you, if you think, hope, wish or pray, find the barriers to these longings too great to bear without some outlet? Then let the paper be your sym-path y, and preserve your desires in print . . . . write something for PHOENIX.\nIf you're not good with words, then maybe you are with pictures, even photos.\nTry it and let us see (before March 1 st).\nWe would also like some help editorially, especially in making a 'Review of\nthe (I.C.)

Luigi Rabbit pouted at the three adventurers.\" What are we going to do with you?\" he asked, rhetorically,\" something frightfully nasty, I think. Large snakes, and buckets of acid perhaps. Oh what a troubled world it is\nfor us decision makers.\" Ferocious had thought of a plan. It all depended on George, who was still making the tea, unaware that the number of guests had increased. It also depended on the Strikingly Offensive Cloak which Ferocious still wore draped around his shoulders. He prayed it was still working. Luigi was still musing on a suitable fate for the adventurers, when Ferocious noticed the door to the front room slowly opening. George appeared in the doorway, at ray with four cups of tea, and some digestive biscuits, in hand.\" Ah,\" he said,\" some friends of yours dropped in? I 'll get some more cups.\" The Luigi Rabbit Organisation swung round as\none man.\" Who' sd is guy?\" inquired Dino. This was the moment that the ever alert D in had been waiting for. Throwing the Strikingly Offensive Cloak hood over his head, he leapt to his feet. It was George who spotted the new look Ferocious first.\n\" E er ch!\" he went, and dropped the tea tray. Hotte a shot down Luigi' s immaculate furry front.\" Ooo oh!\" he shrieked and bounced around the room.\" Run for it!\" shouted the Skull faced Ferocious.\" Donna nobody.... or gh ft!\" commented Dino as a fleeing Tiny Twig worm tried to escape through the wall direct ely behind him.\" Bang! Bang!\" piped Whiskers, waving his trusty carrot at noone in particular. Chaos reigned in the little room, as seven creatures rushed hither and thither.\" Mind the....\" but it was too late, George's warning could not stop the Twig worm reducing his s of a to match wood.\" This way,\" bellowed Ferocious, who had found the door. The others followed the sound of his voice.\" Down the stairs,\" he shouted,\" it's our only hope.\"\" But my house,\" protested George.\" Come with us,\" said Ferocious,\" Those objectionable s will be after us any minute, and they won't be very charitably disposed towards you either.\" Not waiting for ah answer Ferocious pushed George ahead of him down the stairs. Phosphorous and the Twig worm were already thundering along ahead. Above them a shrill voice was shouting.\" Fools, incompetents. I'm surrounded by idiot s.O ooo h,I could scratch your eyes out.\" The four escapees had reached the foot of the tower, and could hear the Luigi Rabbit Organisation tumbling down the stairs in pursuit.\" Back into the stinking jungle, I suppose,\" said Ferocious.\" Yes and no,\" said George,\" Fi do will take us to the beach where my boat is kept, and we can get away in that.\"\" Good thinking, dear old leafy bureaucrat,\" said Ferocious,\" Let's go.\" George whistled in a strange ear tingling way and the jungle moved closer.\" Quick,\" said the Jungle Controller,\" up a tree, and off we go.\" They each selected a tree, and shinned up it. The Twig worm crushed several small saplings before it found one that would bear its huge weight. George whistled again and the section of the jungle from which their trees grew beg an to move slowly into the undergrowth. It was a weird sensation indeed, to be carried along in a tree at a steady fifteen miles an hour, through nature in turmoil. On either side of the oozing Fi do plants and animals were battling for possession of some square yard of jungle floor. From above the heaving carpe i of vegetation waved the occasional anguished branch, twigs clasping at the air, before sinking back into the foe tid undergrowth. A botanical battleground ebbed and flower about the slow moving Fi do. The great forest creature flung back attackers with a flurry of raging tentacles, smaller plant creatures disappearing under it stumbling forward fronds. The hoots and wails of ivy in torment, oaks embattled and fungi funereal, stung the ears of the travellers. How had they got so far on foot before? wondered Ferocious. Perhaps it was thanks to Fi do again \u2014 his presence behind them might have scared off lesser predators. The jungle was beginning to thin out. It\nwas not really the huge area it appeared from outside George's house. The writhing flora turned slowly to more conventional bushes and trees, patches of bare ground appeared underfoot. Fi do slid to a halt.\" We can walk from here,\" said George,\" we are nearly on the beach. I 'll send Fi do back the way we came to discourage those unpleasant chaps from following us.\" The four of them climbed down out of their trees. George talked quietly to Fi do in a mixture of whistles and words.\" He should stop them,\" he said,\" but I 've told him not to harm them, just discourage them from following us.\"\"A true humanitarian,\" said the callous Ferocious D in,\" with a bit of luck something less friendly than Fi do will get to them first.\nHo,h o.\" Slowly their tame piece of jungle swung round and oozed off back the way it had come.\" This way\" said George, and led the adventurers out of the jungle and on to the beach. It looked very much like the beach they had left earlier, except that there, on her moorings, lay George's boat. She was an old Gaff-riR s ced ket rh, with along varnished bowsprit, and black, heavy timbered topsides.\" Gosh!\" said Phosphorous, much imp res sed.\nFELIX No.326; Tuesday,30 th January,1973.

To some it may seem a remote possibility,\nto others, something to be thinking about now. But whichever category we're in, it's odds on that we have very little idea of how to go about it.\nHow do you buy a house? Where do you get the\nmoney? What is a mortgage? Who do you ask? How much can you borrow? And \u2014 for the sc ep tics \u2014 why buy a house at all? Well these are the kind of questions which FELIX FINANCIALLY' s own expert, DEREK E. CUMMINGS will be talking about when he delivers the\nsecond of his General Studies Lectures at Imperial\nCollege next week\u2014-February 6.\nHe will be delighted to answer your questions \u2014\nand even more delighted to relay them to the man he will be bringing to the lecture, Mr. L.R. Pask,\nBranch Manager of one of the biggest building societies in the land.\nThose of you who have been reading FELIX\nFINANCIALLY since the start of the academic year\nwill know that Derek Cummings usually has some fairly stringent and provocative things to say about\nthe financial world and the way it touches us, the consumers. And his second lecture promises to be\nno less contentious.\nFurthermore, he is providing you with the opportunity to throw questions at one of the men whose\njob it is to lend money to prospective house pur-chasers.\nYou will perhaps have read an interview with\nMr. Pask which we published last term in which he\ndescribed the attitudes of his company towards\nlending money to young people. Of necessity, it\nwas a brief resume of the situation. Perhaps there\nare other questions you would like to put.\nHow does a building society decide when to lend\nmoney? Does it have to be tied to your income at\nthe time of application, or does it take account of prospects? Are there ways of graduating repayments to suit improving income? Will the escalation of house prices ever slowdown? If not, why not.\nThose are the kind of things you might like to\nhave answers to. You have questions of your own to ask? Fine. Ask them.\nYou never know. The right answer now might\nsave you a hell of a lot of problems later.\nSo there's a lovely red-brick semi to the north of\nFinchley Road . . . Like the legendary yellow idol\nof Khat mandu, getting possession of it can be a tricky process. It involves building societies, banks,\nsolicitors, the Land Registry, search fees, deposits,\ncontracts, etc., etc.\nIf the prospect of going through with it boggles\nyour mind, then please read on. For this week, we thought it would be useful to describe the sue FEE IX FINANCIALLY cession of events through which the prospective\nhouse-buyer has to go in order to buy his dream\nhouse.\nSo here goes.\nFirst, as Mrs. Beeton would say, find your house.\nIt has to be something you can afford and something\nyou like. Given that, the process is as follows:\nThe estate agent handling the property will want\nsome concrete proof that you are talking with\nserious intent. In other words, he'll want money. He may want a hundred pounds. I suggest you give him twenty-five quid. He'll very likely accept it.\nNext, find a building society with a manager who appears sympathetic and he'll give you an application form for a mortgage.\nThis is a pretty comprehensive questionnaire. It\nwill want to know where you work and what your\nincome is and where your figure can be verified. It\nwill also require you to say if you have any other\ndebts, such as an overdraft or hire purchase commitments. It will want full details of the house you want to\nbuy: the address, the asking price, the rate able value, the type of construction and the date it was built. At the same time, the building society will\nwant their survey fee \u2014 usually about twenty-five\npounds.\nYou will also have to supply the name of your\nsolicitor, since from this moment, all communications will go to him. Therefore, find yourself a lawyer who looks and sounds as if he knows what he is doing and is able\nto do it with some dispatch. As s bon as you have\nsent your application back to the building society,\nfire the gun and get the solicitor moving. The next\nfew pieces of the puzzle are going to depend on him. While the building society is checking out your\npersonal standing and making their survey of the\nhouse, your solicitor should be busy checking on the legal state of your new home.\nThis is called The Search. And it is literally that.\nYour solicitor must find out from the local authority\nwhether, for example, a motorway is due to be built\nacross the spot where your house stands. He must\nascertain what planning proposals there are in the\nvicinity \u2014 a multi-storey car park or a block of flats\nat the end of your garden, for example.\nAt the same time, he must check with the Land\nRegistry what covenants there are attached to the\nSTAPHYLOCOCCUS\nAUREOUS\nIf like me, you' ve been looking up your own arse a lot recently then, wherever your particular fetish lies, you' ve got my sympathies. What prompts me into these reflective cc Mort ions is to inspect the scars and incursions of a medical history of strap hy lo coccus aure o us \u2014 abscesses on the bum. Each time they recur, it's off to the doctor for a second opinion and a course of penicillin. Once I went to see a specialist at St. George's Hospital. Now, some iT iy have seen my rick er since I had a Kaolin poultice slapped on it at age six that even all those students eagerly staring up me bum caused little discomfort. True, I 've never really hit on to the humour of medical students and so didn't spot what they were laughing at but when he stuck this sort of bicycle pump with a torch on the end, up it the rn'ii d did flip a Httle. \" Give' ema bit of cold steel, sir.\" Anyway, I'm sorry, doc.I'd got the tickets for the Ents all night er and the bottle of whisky before me bum trouble started so I had togo. Now, maybe, Sam Apple Pie area very good band but what came out of those speakers was more... a real mind bender. Next time, kids, just leave the dope at home and push through three Am pic ill in capsules and a few swigs of Scotch and relax and enjoy the sounds. Mind you, it\nmust have worn off by the time J. Gei ls came on. Was this really the same J. Gei ls band whose albums I had told all my friends about? Was this bumbling Ros ko, gushing forth verbal diarrhoea( reminding me of my ailing anus), presenting this slick, sick show the same lead s'inger? We soon warm to your talent, mate, in this hothouse of a great hall without this contrived, ultra timed Osmond packaged frenzy. No, mate. It wasn't me stood outside the Churchill Hotel in the rain. Maybe I was feeling down before going to the concert, Ents., but there did seem to be a lot of us there and a lot of gatecrashers a in d no bar and noone knew what was going on. Nipped over to the Union bar during the two hours between ev mts \u2014 Wales had been playing England \u2014 faces at the door checking Union cards, faces that left college years ago. Nice guys, though \u2014 Brendan said his usual\" Pint of Lager, Martin.\" \u2014 never drink the stuff \u2014 had a pint of Guinness and expressed sympathy for inferior races. The Tuesday before I'd dashed home to see the Warhol film on the box. Instead found out how the British legal system works. Marvellous showpiece for the World. Works incredibly fast. None of your bureaucratic nonsense in courts. Good, instant justice. Well, said the judges to the plaintiff, you have n't seen the film, we have n't seen the film and the IBA board have n't seen the film so we'll stop anyone else from seeing it. Someone had seen the film. The News of the World had seen the film, and true to their peculiar brand of perverted altruism, explained in lurid detail how it\nwould shock and disgust us. The Sunday Mirror had seen the film. The Daily Express had n't seen the film but felt sure it would be disgusting and the judges took note of what they thought it would be Jike if\nthey had. The News of the World even quoted the worst bit of dialogue in the film. Woman:\" Have you slept with a man?\" Man:\"Y es.\" Woman:\" Would you like to sleep with my husband?\"( Man:\" No,I 've got my Guinness Book of Records to keep me warm.\") Must br Vig out an injunction against the Guinness Book for failing to mention New Mills Prize Band as the oldest brass band in the country. My old grand daddy used to play double B for them. Ents... a word in you rear about these overcrowded concerts you keep holding... MARTIN DOUGHTY site \u2014 such things as your not being allowed to keep\na dog or build a shed or paint the house blue. It's better to find these things out before you move in, for obvious reasons.\nThere is quite a lot of investigation involved in\nall this so it is as well to get the solicitor away to\na good start and, if necessary, prompt him to complete the search quickly. It will take the building\nsociety about two or three weeks to complete their\ninvestigations and to make an offer, and by then\nyou need to know the legal score.\nSo, to The Offer. The most crucial bit of the\nwhole operation.\nIf the building society offers to lend you what you asked for, then you are home and dry. But they may\nnot necessarily do so.\nThe crux of the matter is the building society's valuation of the property. It could easily be less\nthan the asking price, for a number of reasons. In\nthe first place, the vendor might just be greedy and over D rice the house. On the other hand, there may be hidden structural faults in the building. That does\nnot mean that the roof is about to cave in: it may be something as simple as faulty floorboards. In any\ncase, the building society isn't bound to tell you about it. Their opinion of the house will be reflected\nin their offer.\nThe difference is that although they may give you the percentage of mortgage you asked for \u2014 say ninety per cent \u2014 it will be a percentage of a lower\nfigure.\nAll of which leaves you with two alternatives.\nEither go and beat the vendor until he reduces his\nprice to the building society's valuation \u2014 or borrow\nthe difference.\nOne thing is certain. The building society will\nnot budge, and you can either lump it or leave it.\nBut let's leave aside complications like that for\nthe moment. Let's assume the building society fulfils your hopes and offers you the money you need.\nIn accepting their offer, you enter into a legal\ncontract with them to begin repayments as set out\nby them, from the moment they hand over the cash\nto the vendor.\nIn the meant'me, having got the promise of the\nmoney, your solicitor is in a position to exchange\ncontracts with the vendors' solicitors. And this involves the most painful part of it all. For it is then\nyou have to hand over your money. That is, ten per\ncent of the agreed price. And it is important that\nyou do have ten per cent in your pocket, even\nthough you may be getting a ninety-five per cent\nmortgage. You will get the other five per cent back,\nof course, but you have to be in a position to put\ndown the full ten.\nHaving done all that, you await completion day \u2014\nnormally twenty-eight days after the exchange of\ncontracts. And that, finally, is the day the building\nsociety pays the vendor his money, you move in land start paying.\nAt that time, too, you are also liable to pay your\nsolicitor' his search fees, stamp duties and his own convey anc ing fee \u2014 which will depend on the price\nof the property.\nIn reality, the system works reasonably well \u2014\nafter all hundreds do it every day \u2014 and the whole\nthing should take no more than six to e;g ht weeks.\nProviding, that is, that there are no delays.\nAvoiding the irritation of delay is really a matter\nof organising your affairs properly. Make sure you fill out the application form properly \u2014 and sign it.\nMake certain that the solicitor you choose really\ndoes get moving on the first day and keep your eye\non him to make sure he is doing what he ought to be\ndoing on your behalf. Be sure you have the money\nfor the deposit when it is required. Inform whoever\nis going to verify your income that the building\nsociety is going to contact him, and check that he\nreplies immediately.\nSmall things, all of them, but important.\nRemember, it's a seller's market. If you waste\ntoo much time, someone else could easily come along and snatch the house from over your head. So it'swo't h tak:\nng the trouble to see there are no un necessary hold-ups. After all, buying a house is\nprobably going to be the biggest single financial\ndeal you'll ever get involved in. Derek Cummings will be speaking today\nin Physics Lecture Theatre 1 at 1.30\np.m. Come along and find out what he's like in the flesh (Revelations Guaranteed).\n\n"

    "content": "Page 4 FELIX30 th January, 1973\nLetters\nMarxist\nMisconceptions\nSir, \u2014 A letter in last\nweek's Felix created some\nmisconceptions about t ne Marxist analysis of society\u2014\nmisconceptions fostered by\nthose who wish to artificially\ndivide students from the rest\nof the working class.\nKarl Marx realised that\nthe social and political fabric of society is determined\nby the economic structure\nand therefore correctly analysed that there are only\nclasses in advanced capitalist society (i.e. that in\nBritain today) \u2014 those who\nown the means of production\nand exploit the labour of\nothers (capitalists or bourgeoisie) and those who are\nexploited (the proletariat).\nExploitation comes about because the workers are paid\nless than the value of the\ncommodities they produce.\nThe difference is called surplus value and is divided up\namong various sections of\nthe bourgeoisie (employers,\nland owners, government,\netc.).\nIt is easy to see these relations in production in the\ncase of a worker in a factory\nbut they are equally in existence in the case of all other\npeople who are employed by\nthe capitalist system. For ex-ample: it is not obvious what\ncommodity a shop assistant\nproduces, however such a person still produces surplus\nvalue in that the value produced by her labour 'i.e. the\npart she plays in producing\nthe profit made by the shop\nas a whole) is less than the\nwages she receives. Such a relationship exists in all\nforms of employment. The\naim of the capitalist class is\nto make a profit out of employing workers (this is the\nonly way profit can be made)\nand so no worker is employed unless a profit is\nmade from his labour.\nStudents are in no way\nseparate from society and so\nmust enter into the same\neconomic relationship. Students do not exploit the\nlabour of others and are\ntherefore not capitalists. In\ntraining a student, value is\nproduced for the capitalist\nclass in the form of greater\nskills given to the student in\norder that the student may\nproduce a greater amount of\nsurplus value in future em-ploy ment. The amount of the\nsurplus value produced directly due to this extra training received is greater than\nthe amount it costs for the\nbourgeoisie to train the student (including the grant\npaid to the student) or it\nwould not be profitable for\nthe capitalist class to give\nsuch training. Therefore the\nstudent is exploited as a stu dent, however the surplus\nvalue produced during his\nperiod as a student is only\nrealised later during employ-ment.\nThere can be no sections\nof society that are classless, such people could not exist\nin a capitalist society without taking part in the capitalist production relations as\nthere are no other stable\nforms of existence. The misconception put forward in the\nletter arises from not understanding how workers other\nthan industrial workers do in\nfact produce surplus value\nand from confusing subjective ideas of class with the objective definition. This gives\nrise to a fictitious middle\nclass (including teachers,\ndoctors, \"intellectuals\",\nhigher paid workers, etc. the\nlist being subjective in origin can be extended indefinitely) who have however no\nseparate relation with the\nmeans of production and\ntherefore cannot form a class.\nIf in fact one limits the\nproletariat to those who work\nin factories one arrives at a situation where the \"working\nclass\" is very small and decreasing steadily in number\n(with mechanization) which\nis in contradiction to Marx's analysis. If this were true\nhow could the situation arise\nwhere the proletariat becomes strong enough to\nseize power and overthrow\ncapitalism?\nSections of society that\npreviously regarded them\nselves as middle class are\nbeginning to realise that their\nposition is no different to that\nof industrial workers and\ntherefore are beginning to\nfight exploitation in the same\nway as industrial workers\n(e.g. civil servants, teachers,\nnurses, etc.). This is a great\npolitical advance for our\nclass. One of the main hindrances to struggle among\nsuch sections of the proletariat as students is the notion\nthat we are middle class and\nsomehow privileged. Students are increasingly beginning to realise that this is\nnot so. Revolutionaries\nshould aim at destroying illusions not reinforcing them\nwith false analysis.\nYours sincerely,\nSONIA HOCHFELDER\nBroadsheet\nInaccurate\nMein Herr, \u2014 / must protest at the space wasted in\nyour fine newspaper by being filled by Mr. Appleby,\nthe perpetrator of a certain\nobscene publication. Obviously the circulation of his\ntabloid is so bad that he has\nto seek further outlets for\nhis filth. What particularly\nstruck me about his at ric le was the complete distortion\nof the truth. As the first sentence implied, this article\nwas aimed at those who\nhave no knowledge of the\nday to day events of College\nlife with the obvious intention of persuading them that\nr.c.s. is worth knowing\nabout. It is therefore for the\nbenefit of these ignorant\npeasants that I, as the champion of truth, liberty, and all\nthat crap, without dwelling\ntoo long on this sordid ar-tic le, would like to put the\nrecord straight on a couple\nof points.\nFirstly, it was stated that\non two occasions, the supposed cream of this scientific college were unable to\nfind the sign that they\nmissed in the room that they\nentered so rudely to look for\nit. Had they in fact approached the C.&G. Union\nOffice in a more appropriate\nmanner, they would no doubt\nhave been invited to gaze upon their sign, which is today\nwhere it was then, tastefully\ndisplayed in a glass case together with a similar sign\nfrom the mining school and\nother trophies.\nSecondly, in addition to\nthe objects stated to have\nbeen removed from the C.&G. Union Office, the r.c.s. \"revenge squad\" saw fit to\ntake with them records, pap-ers, files, collecting-cans,\nand personal property, articles which are not mascots\nand are properly considered\ninviolate, into which category\nmust fall the shields referred\nto, which any fool could remove anyway. In addition, an\nash-tray removed by the\n\"squad\", if such a rabble\ncan be so called, was immediately and deliberately\nsmashed. If such vandalism\nis Mr. Appleby's idea of in-ter-union rivalry, then I suggest that he encourages his\nfellow louts to carry it on\nwith the school of mines, the\nwell-known float saboteurs.\nYours spherically\nAdolph von Weasel grope President, C&G Mudslinging Society.\nRoom\nBookings\nSir, \u2014 I refer to the article on the back page of the last Felix, in order to correct a number of errors in it.\nIt was said that\" Mr. Mooney could not in any case supply it, on his own admission\". This is not correct, as he was not asked to. Further discussion rev ea led that the Chinese Society required the Dining Room, College Block, although their representatives informed me that it was the S CR Southside. Finally, the article stated that\" S CC met urgently on Thursday, to discuss the matter.\" This is not true, as the meeting had been scheduled for sometime, and although this item was by far the longest, it was brought up under A. O.B. The Clarification of the situation as regards the book' ng of rooms in College Following discussion with Dr. Levy and Mr. Mooney, Iam able to give the full story behind the\" rooms flare up\" mentioned in the last edition of Felix, and also give some views of mine on the general question of charging for rooms. In considering the reason for raising a charge for the hire of a refectory area, the following points should be borne in mind:( i) Mr. Mooney is mandated to make a marginal 'profit', sufficient to\ncover refurbishing.( ii) No loss on the refectory facilities will be paid for by the University Grants Committee.( iii) Mr. Mooney has to\npay for all outgoing sc fi the refectory areas, although he receives them rate and rent free. Consequently, whenever an application is made for the use of a refectory area, without any refectory ser-vices:\" The bookings shall be considered individually, and if granted maybe subject to\na charge.\"( Principles for the booking of College Refectory Areas and Facilities.) The rates which maybe charged are the College rates of hire, less331 percent for Imperial College Clubs. In the case of the Chinese Society there seemed to be a large number of people who were not members of the Imperial College Chinese Society coming to the event. For the S.E. Asia Society( SEA SOC), they were bringing in\" box meals\"; Mr. Mooney' s point about this was that inevitably a profit\nmargin was made by the cate rer s, and it seemed\" silly\" when this was not being put back into College. If the Societies consulted him first, he could give a quotation, and try and obtain an outside specialist chef if\nnecessary. The club could then go out and ob ta'n additional quotations, but could then be expected to pay the hire charge, if Mr. Mooney felt that he could handle the catering. My chief areas of concern cover the' grey regions' in the booking of rooms:( i) Does the clause that\n'a charge maybe made' imply that the rate\nwould automatically be the full one?( ii) What would a hire charge cover? Plates, crockery, etc.? Would these be separate items, or would this beam a tter for negotiation?( iii) Are the rates too high for College Functions?( iv) Would a per capita basis for charging be fairer, but more difficult\nto implement? It certainly appears that Iam not the only one concerned about these points, and I hope to report back to Felix about the clarified position in the very near future. I will endeavour to produce an information sheet about char ges for hire of glasses, etc., to\ntry and clear up some of the grey ness. It will in effect be a guide to obtaining the best out of the refectory services. If you have any ideas about the problems of charging/ not charging please feel free to let me know about them. Yours faithfully, G. D.D. JACKSON, Chairman, S CC TEACHING WEEK\nIf you have seen a black and yellow poster in College advertising\" The West London Chaplaincies' Teaching Week\" you probably thought it was either connected with schools or that\nit was some kind of mission to convert the whole of I.C. to\nChristianity. It is, of course, neither of these things. Teaching Week is the highlight of the year for the Christian Community in I.C.. and its main feature is that this year a dozen or so monks will be living in the College( in halls and student houses) and taking an active part in the life of the\nChaplaincies. The groups of students who meet regularly in every hall and department will meet nearly everyday during the week, and there will be special events most evenings at MoreHouse, as\nwell as two General Studies meetings.\nThe main purpose of the week is to enrich the life of Christians in Imperial College and to buildup the sense of community. This year, for the first time, Teaching Week has been organised on a completely ecumenical basis, and thus we hope it will benefit even more students than in previous years.\nThe events of Teaching Week are. of course, open to every one. If you have not yet seen a poster, this is what you are in danger of missing: MAIN EVENTS OF THE WEEK: ( Saturday3 rd February to Sunday,11 th February) SUNDAY, 4th FEBRUARY\n10.0 a.m. Eucharist in the anteroom, College Block in I.C.

Folk\nSir, \u2014 On reading this\nweek's Felix Diary, I was\nvery disturbed to find that\nyou are now giving free publicity to outside organisations while stabbing IC societies in the back. Specifically\nyou advertised the Holy\nGround Folk Club on the\nsame night as IC Folk Club.\nWhilst you may be within\nyour rights to do this it is\nclear that IC societies will\nsuffer as a result of your ac-t ions. IC Folk Club is in financial difficulties this year anyway and any efforts to re\nverse this situation will be\nruined if this irresponsible\nsabotage by the organ of the\nUnion continues.\nM.J. SIMMONS\nPresident IC Folk Club\nInquorate\nmeetings\nSir, \u2014 / am continually\nshocked and disappointed at\nthe methods used by IC\nUnion Executive to prolong\nin quo rate Union General\nMeetings.\nThe habit of opening a \"Meeting of IC Students\"\nimmediately after closing a UGM is repugnant to all\nthose members of the Union\nwith a trace of democracy in\ntheir souls.\nAs I understand the s ys tem, in order to ensure that\nUnion Meetings are representative, a quorum of members is fixed, below which\nbusiness is not conducted.\nStanding orders incorporate\nthe provision that \"the meeting is deemed in quo rate until\nchallenged\" so that non contentious matters such as announcements may be made.\nAt last Thursday's meeting the Exec openly flouted\nthese principles and took a vote on a very contentious\nsubject \u2014 a refectory boycott \u2014 when only about 1S0 members were present.\nI find it very difficult to believe that we really need\nunion meetings every week\n\u2014 be they General or Extraordinary -\u2014- as this will only\nserve to bore and alienate\nthe average \"moderate\"\nmember and result in only\npolitical activists attending\nmeetings.\nI remain, in hope of a return to visible democracy.\nYours faithfully,\nCHARLES RUSS DEN Physics P.G.

No. 326\nGRANTS CAMPAIGN\nIN FULL SWING\nThe NUS Grants Campaign went into full swing\nyesterday, starting with six regional press conferences.\n(Full coverage of the London one in next week's FELIX). Digby Jacks, in a speech launching the cam-pa ign, said that it would not be an easy or quick cam-pa ign.\" But I know that students feel angry enough\nover the ms an ness and hypocrisy of this Government\non this issue to sustain a campaign in top gear for as\nlong as necessary,\" he continued.\nEffect of boycotts? \"WE'LL CLOSE\nREFECTORIES\nSays Mooney\n\" Nil\" is Mr. Mooney's opinion of the immediate\neffect that catering boycotts would have on the college.\nMr. Mooney, the college's catering manager, was interviewed by FELIX on Thursday following the overwhelming decision of a \"meeting of IC students\" (the\nE.G. M. having just been declared in qu or atc) to use\nthis means of press u rising the college authorities to\npress our case for higher grants to the DE S.He told FELIX that the Mr. Mooney criticised\ncost of the wasted food in the union for picking on\nThe first major national action, apart from rent strikes and refectory boy-cot ts, will be a set of demonstrations in seven major regional centres \u2014 London, Edinburgh, Newcastle, Sheffield, Manchester, Cardiff and Bristol \u2014 on Wednesday, February21. There will also be\na National Day of Action on March14. There are now42 rent strikes underway in Britain. London colleges involved are Brunei University, City University, Queen Elizabeth College, LSE, Westfield College, City Poly, and Central London Poly. At Westfield, where hall fees include meals, the authorities threatened to cut off meals. The union is thus to handover the cost of these from the rent strike fund. Central Poly has now switched to a policy of rent strikes fol-lowing successful refectory boycotts last term. Most areas also have plans for their own demonstrations in addition to those planned for February21 and March14. Imperial College's one is planned for February7. any one refectory would\nbe of the order of \u00a380 per\nmeal boycotted. He\nthought that no effect\nwould be felt by the college before the end of the\nacademic year, \"but if it\ncontinues beyond then the\nposition would have to be\nreviewed\". He considers\nthe likely effects would be\nthe same as those at Canterbury: the college would\nstart to close down re fec tories, starting with the\nUnion. If the Action Committee picks on the Union\nfor boycotts, \"the closure\nof it will be precipitated\".\nNext to go would be the\nbreakfast and weekend\nservices in Southside.\n\"the weakest area\" of the\ncollege administration. He told FELIX that, whereas\nevery other sector received\na grant, the refectories\nwere meant to pay their\nway.\nHe pointed out that the\neffect of boycotts on the\nrefectory staff had been\ndisregarded, and said that\nthe effect when the union\norganised such boycotts\ntwo years ago was con-side r able. \"The staff can't believe that boycotts aren't directed against them,\" he\nsaid. He wanted to know\nwhat the union and its\nmembers would think if\nthe staff organised a boy-c ott, and went home in\nHOKHO.X REEVE\n\" Of course, with Vietnam over, there won't be so\nmuch scope for you younger chaps.\"\nSRC TO BE\n'DEMOCRATISED'\nThe University of London Union Students' Representative Council( UL US RC) set up a working party at its meeting last Monday to find ways of democrat ising its structure by means of constitutional chan ges. Much criticism has been levelled at the S RC and its\ndegree of representation over the past year, and this is the first concrete move it\nhas made to \" put its house in order.\" The working party will present such changes as it\nthinks necessary to the Statutory Meeting to be held at\nChelsea College on February17. Monday's meeting also carried a motion supporting the students at Non in gt on College of Physical Education in their fight for a sabbatical president, and agreed to send a special envoy to the college to give\" physical as well as\nmoral'' support.S RC was reminded of the existence of its working party on the Murray Report. Paul Goddard, Chelsea President, told the meeting that only one response had so far been forthcoming to the\nworking party' s request for reaction from individual union s.IC is one of those not to have yet replied. the middle of a major\nevening function.\nIf Mr. Mooney is right,\nthe college will close all\nthe refectories before they\nnegotiate with the Government on our behalf as\na result of operating refectory boycotts.\nONLY 150 AT E.G. M Last Thursday's Extraordinary General Meeting was\ndeclared in quo rate a few moments before the vote on\nrefectory boycotts, and so the overwhelming vote in\nfavour by the \"Meeting of I.C. students\" which, pre-dicta bly, immediately followed the closure of the EG M, can only be taken as an indication of students' feelings.\nThe meeting, only about sent his motion on Supplementary Grants. Although he obtained the necessary130 signatures to call a meeting he failed to get that number of votes \u2014 his motion was overwhelmingly defeated.150 strong the quorum is\n300) was opened18 minutes late at 1.18, following the inevitable late arrival of the Executive \u2014 President at 1.06,\nSecretary at 1.10, Deputy President at 1.12. ( \" Felix\" reporter at 12.57!)\nThe impatient audience became progressively more so until the motions came to\nbe discussed at about1.45. The Extraordinary Meeting was petitioned for by Pete Gillett so that he could pre DEPARTMENT REPS CRITICISED Astir was caused at the meeting when all the Departmental Representatives present were asked to stand up \u2014 revealing there to be\nonly one present from a tot al of more than ten. The request followed John Lane's condemnation of the fact that only three Dept Reps had held the meetings they had been mandated to on the Grants issue, and that the others had not even bothered to contact him. Pete Gillett told the meeting that the Civil Engineering representative had not only not arranged a meeting, but actually did not believe in students getting higher grants. Mr. Gillett said he had taken it upon himself to\norganise a meeting. The EG M agreed that similar action by individuals should be taken in other inactive departments.( Minutes \u2014 Page2) ARE YOU A PATHETIC\nThere are over four thousand students at Imperial College. The quorum for a union meeting is, however, only three hundred. One would have thought that such a small quorum, only7}% of coll ge, would be relatively easy to obtain. Nevertheless, union meetings are regularly in quo rate, or very nearly so. Last Thursday, for example, an extraordinary general meeting on what one would have thought was a subject vital to every student, that of grants, was attended, according to the minutes, by only one hundred and fifty people. In other words, less than4% of the students here were sufficiently interested to go along and see what was being said about their main source of income. At nearly every meeting important issues are discussed, motions are passed and then published as the decisions of I.C. union. These pronouncements are put out ii YOUR name, for you are all members of the union. I have f re que i/ it ly heard people complain that they never go to union meetings because they are boring and uninteresting. They often couple this with the argument that meetings are unrepresentative so that there is no reason why they should abide by their decisions. The union is only unrepresentative because such people are too lazy to attend union meetings and put\nforward their views. It cannot function effectively unless the mass of students are prepared to participate in its discussion said decisions. It exists for your benefit. It\nis there for you to have the opportunity to voice your opinions. Most people at Imperial College appear to ignore their union until it says something with which they totally disagree. Then, and only then, when a meeting has already decided on a certain course of action, do they protest. And how do they protest? They ignore the union ruling' because it's unrepresentative'. Noc ne has the right to do this. A union is only a union when its members implement its decisions. If they feel that, unless they participate, a wrong decision maybe made, it is their duty to speak out beforehand. It is only when you take part that the decisions of Imperial College union are the decisions of the majority of Imperial College students. There is a union meeting on Thursday at which the motions that ICU may submit to theN US confer e ice in April will be discussed. Anybody has the right to submit a motion before the union meeting. Motions already tabled by the External Affairs committee and various individuals appear on page7. Read the mo tien s.Unless you agree with every sentiment of every motion you must attend the meeting on Thursday. You don't have to speak \u2014 but you must vote. If you don't, views with which you have no sympathy may well go forward to theN US conference as your views. MICHAEL SILVER LEAF "

Foreign Stud ents visiting the Continent have to have rc cn try visas if they want to continue studying in Britain.

Accordingly, the R.A.T.T. has\nnot been designed to be a medium for publicity or\ninstant communication.\nThat is a job for Felix\nand S.T.O.I.C.

This\nis not intended in any way\nto replace the fuller selection over in the Careers\nLibrary in the College\nBlock, but is aimed at\nthose students who do not\nhave any specific career\naims, but want to browse\naround in an informal at-mo sphere, and only go to\nthe Careers Library when\nthey have a specific re-quest.

The Registry is always overcrowded in the\nfirst 3 days of an academic\nyear, with the twofold\nproblem of registration\nplus associated enquiries\nand the issue of grant\ncheques.\nI have arranged for the\nRegistry to give out grant\ncheques via the counter\nfacilities in the R.A.T.T.

There are enormous advantages to be gained by using this service. End sleigh Insurances( Brok ers) Ltd, offer special terms on all classes of personal insurances to members of NUS. Schemes such as\" Student plan\" motor insurance and\" Study plan\" property insurance have been negotiated with leading insurance companies. Life, Motor, Travel, Property and other policies are all available at exclusive terms.\nThe Insurance Assistant for this College is Monica Small and will be available daily during term time from11.302.30 to answer all your insurance queries.

Travel Bureau is now in its4 th year of operation and we hope to operate a more comprehensive programme during1973 than in previous years. Due to extensive re housing during the first term the bureau was unable too pe rate and for any inconvenience caused to students we apologise. However, with the opening of the' room at the top' we will now be open every Tue s. and Thur s. lunchtime1 pm2 pm.\" This year not only will the bureau be concerned with flights, boats and trains to most major destinations Paul Jowitt, the man who made\nit all possible.\nin the northern hemisphere but we have information on Safari holidays, ski weekends and numerous other holiday pursuits. It is hoped as enquiries increase towards the end of term that the bu c rau will be open daily. That briefly is the aim of I.C.

Geoff Tate Counselling\nThe Student Counsellor, Bonne y Hart net t,will also be involved in\" Room at the Top\", She will spend Tuesday and Friday lunchtimes between1.30 p.m. and2.30 p.m.( probably with sandwich in hand) in her corner of Room at the Top. Bonne y spends her time counselling students mostly by appointment in her room at the Health Centre. Although students with any sort of problem are welcome to consult her there, she is find-ing that most of her time these days is spent on counselling students with personal and academic problems. Her involvement with Room at the Top will complement the counselling role here. She feels that she will be able to offer help, information and advice with problems. Room at the Top is in many ways a service and information centre and Bonne y sees her role there partly in the light of this. She hopes to offer advice and help, for example with special accommodation or financial problems, legal and any other matters and to provide information as requested. Bonne y is at present in the process of compiling a comprehensive self help syst em the form of which is as\nyet undecided. This will in time also be available in Room at the Top. The other important aspect of her participation in this scheme is to be more accessible and there by to facilitate more informal contact. Bonne y is hoping that students will feel free to come along and say hello, chat, exchange ideas, discuss her work, put forward suggestions etc.\n\n"

In the second half things started to look better with I.C. gaining control of the midfield and snuffing out all of Chalfont St. Peter's attacks. However, during this time the attack failed to get a clean shot at the Chalfont goal. Obviously this could not continue and didn't \u2014 ire ten min u tes towards the end of the game, Chalfont easily put another four into the back of the net.\nDespite the size of the' defeat, the I.C. defence had a fairly good. game1 \u2014 they were in a different class. Graham Pop ple played exceedingly well at centre half and debut boy Colin Dyer, after a shaky start, made his presence felt at left-half.\nThe second XI also played at Chalfont on Saturday. They played nine against eleven, lost 1-0 and Mick Downs did not write this report. A rare event occurred at H arlington last Saturday \u2014 I.C.3 rd XI won their second match of the season. For this match I.C. tried their new secret weapon \u2014 they only had seven players. Not to be outdone, Chalfont countered by only having eight\nGUILDSHEET\nIn Felix last week Mr. R. Appleby (or is it Miss?)\nstarted his (or her) article;\n\"It seems that a large proportion of RCS enthusiasts\nand Guildstwats are unaware of the active rivalry that\ntook place, more or less continuously, throughout last\nterm between the unions of these two constituent col-leg es.\" It would seem to me, however, that the person knowing least of what went on was Mr. Appleby himself.\nIn the last paragraph of his article he refers to the\nabduction of the Guilds' Fruit, collected for Morphy Day, from Guilds' Union Office. This both mystifies\nand surprises me. Does Mr. Appleby really think\nGuilds would store rotten fruit in their lovely clean\nunion office? Surely not. The fruit was stored nowhere\nnear the Union Office \u2014 in fact it was in one of the\nlock-up sheds under Exhibition Road, in front of Mech.\nEng. It was from here that RCS forcibly broke the lock\nand stole the fruit. This stupid and useless sortie\nachieved nothing \u2014 except for making RCS smell even\nmore than usual.\nReference was also made to the relieving of Guilds\nof some yellow shields. Once again Mr. Appleby is far\nfrom the complete truth. The occasion he refers to, Iam sure, is when Guilds were busy finishing their float\nfor the Lord Mayor's Show. A bunch of supposed responsible citizens then rushed into the union office and\njust picked up everything in sight, including students'\nfolders, and most important some polystyrene letters\nwhich had been prepared for Guilds' float. They then\nrushed out again, d roping litter all over Mech. Eng.\nand breaking half the letters. After some time these\nletters were regained by Guilds, but a large number had\nto be remade. This complete irresponsibility of RCS nearly sabotaged Guilds' noble act of holding high\nthe hand of Imperial College at the Lord Mayor's Show. I wonder why Mr. Appleby left this information out of his article?\nAnd now for an earth-shattering disclosure. Three\nattempts by RCS have failed to locate their beloved\nUnion Office Sign, but Guilds will now tell them where\nit is. Yes folks, only RCS could fail to look in the\nmost obvious place. Ever since Guilds have had possession of this sign it has been ON SHOW for all to\nsee in the GUILDS' TROPHY CABINET. RCS must\nall be blind, I suppose.\nPerhaps in future Mr. Appleby will get his facts\nright.

Faced with such overwhelming supremacy Chalfont resorted to dirty tactics \u2014 their fullback cum umpire bent the rules with considerable skill to disallow nearly all of I.C.'s goal attempts. However, midway through the first half I.C. eventually managed to score thanks to Dave Neal( or was it Beat?)(a third team joke?). The I.C. defence was never seriously troubled( the goalkeeper got frozen to the goalpost) and we ran out easy win nets 1-0.

MIXED HOCKEY Despite only having ten players last Sunday, I.C. comfortably defeated City University by the only goal of the game. I.C. were on top for most of the match and the miracle was that only one goal was scored. This inability to score was partially due to some unusual play by the City goalkeeper, but mainly to the chronic shooting of the I.C. forwards. The goal, scored in the first half, was atypical(?)

These are the motions coming to Thursday's U GM, and thence( if you approve) to theN US Conference. Contact lenses maybe bought at a discount through theN US... DRAMA\n1. Drama Colleges Motion\nPre-amble\ni. ICU Notes: that changes are required in the\npresent nature of training students for work in\nthe Dramatjc Arts \u2014 a profession which has\nhigh unemployment and restricted entry.\nii. that clarification is needed into the definition\nof the term Drama College.\niii. that an enquiry is about to take place into the\ntraining of students at Drama Colleges at which\nstudent opinion is not directly repressed.\niv. that students at Drama Colleges are not organised into effective student unions for the protection of their interests.\nv. that students of Drama are only eligible for\ndiscretionary awards.\nAction\nICU calls upon the NUS Executive to:\ni. ensure that student opinion is represented at\nany enquiry into the training of students at\nDrama Colleges.\nii. work towards the establishment of effective\nstudent unions in colleges of Drama to ensure\nthat the interests of students are represented\nat a local level and encourage the establishment of a National Association of Drama Colleges Student Unions' along the lines of the\nNational Association of Music Colleges Student\nUnions for the full discussion of and action\non common problems.\niii. make special note in the campaign against\ndiscretionary awards to the problems of Drama\nStudents, and to fight for the right of students\nto train for a profession in the Dramatic Arts.\nGRANTS\nBackground\nNUS recognises that:\n(1) Grants are part of the cost of higher e duca tion.\n(2) Higher education is being re-orientated and\nthe costs restructured to meet the changing needs\nof British industry. Intensified international competition and falling rates of profit are forcing the\ngovernment to increase the pace of technological\ninnovation and hence to reorganise and re-strUcture\nthe costs of higher education.\n{3} The problem therefore is not simply the\nstudent grant \u2014 the value of which has fallen as\npart of the cutback in costs of higher education \u2014\nbut also of the way the government is attempting to\n-force students and college workers to pay for its\n'rational is ation' and re-orientation by:\n(a)DES instructions that catering must be self-financing \u2014 leading to price increases and\nworker redundancies (e.g. in Kent).\n(b)UG C attempts to institute loan-financed and\nself-financed halls, whereby students are\nforced to pay for building, and workers laid\noff.\n(4) Although the Vice-Chanceilors want to increase student grants \u2014 to avoid trouble, \u2014 they\nare united with the government on their mutual\nneed to re-structure the costs of higher education.\nPolicy\nThe central aims of the NUS grants campaign\nmust be as follows:\n(1) To explain that the government must take\nfull responsibility for the financing of higher education \u2014 neither students nor workers are responsible for this. The state must pay for its\nproblems here as elsewhere \u2014 students and workers are not responsible for these problems.\n(2) Struggles against price rises, rent increases,\ncut-backs in workers' jobs and the like in such a manner as to upset the smooth running of institutions of higher education so as to force the government to take heed and to raise the possibility\nof groups of workers supporting our struggles.\nThis approach is incompatible with a perspective\nof seeking 'support' from Vice-Chancellors and\nMP's, etc., who are opposed to students taking\neffective action. Therefore NUS must not have any\nperspective of forming alliances with MP's or ViceChancellors in the fight for student needs. We\nexpect, rather, that any MP's and Vice-Chancellors,\netc., who seriously support our demands will support our campaign.\n(3) That to reflect the true wishes of students\nas a whole the main demands of the present campaign should be\n(a) Full grants for all students (that is an end\nto discretionary awards, discrimination\nagainst married women students and all\nparental contributions to the grants i.e. the\nmeans test).\n(b)An increase in the grant to counter the\neffects of inflation since 1962 since when\nthe value of the grant has been falling (i.e. at least \u00a3100).\n(4) That the introduction of cash grants in colleges of education should be a further aim of this\ncampaign. Prepayment of hall and catering fees is\ninconsistent with the right of students to spend\ntheir grant as they wish and furthermore to withhold such payments. No increases in 'costs are to\nbe tolerated as a result of this.\n(5) That priority in the campaign should also\nbe given to an increase of \u00a3100 in the post-g radu ate grant, and the restoration of the London allowance for post-graduates.\n(6) That the fight for a decent standard of living\nwill not cease with the present campaign.\n(7) That the introduction of a so-called student\nwage system will do nothing to improve the standard of living of students and is therefore totally\nirrelevant to our needs. NUS should concentrate\non trying to improve the level of the grant not its\nname and drop this demand.\n-(8) To totally reject the freeze and all other anti\nworking class legislation. We shall continue the\nfight for higher grants no matter what legal measures the state may put in our way.\n(9) That it is unproductive to seek promises\nfrom the Labour Party. Repeated commitments from\nthe Labour Party have proved worthless, so\nattempts to channel the campaign into parliamentary\nmethods must be opposed. Our greater strength\nlies in mass a,ction not in the influence of student\nvotes. NUS should concentrate its efforts on mobil-ising students and not waste time on MP's.(10) That any decision on the acceptance or\nrejection of a government offer must be taken\ndemocratically by all students and not by the NUS Executive alone.\nCampaign\nThe rent strike is not the only tactic we can use\nin this or subsequent campaigns. One day strikes,\noccupations, boycotts of lectures, a temporary halt\nto research and other such tactics on alo caf basis\nare also effective in putting pressure on the college\nauthorities.\nInstructions\n1. To Exec & CO's To change the demands of the present campaign in accordance with Policy 1, 2 and 3.\n2. To Exec\nTo support all colleges taking action over any\nof the demands of the campaign.\n3 . To Exec & CO's Not to waste time and effort in trying to get the\nsupport of the Labour Party or MPs.4. To Exec\nTo Call a one day Emergency Conference as\nsoon as an offer by the government is made\nknown to decide acceptance or rejection of such\nan offer on the basis of the decisions of union\nmeetings in CO's. This Emergency Conference\nwould also discuss further action if necessary.\nTo ensure the minimum of absences through the\nfinancial situation of small unions, arrangements\nshould be made for the registration fee to be\nwaived in cases of financial hardship.\nWHITE PAPER\nTopic: White Paper\nPreamble\nICU notes the Government White Paper ( Cm d5174), misleading ly titled \"Education: A Framework for Expansion\".\nICU states its total rejection of the educational\nphilosophy on which the White Paper is based,\nspawned as it is by the need of capitalism to cut\ncosts; ICU rejects in particular the misleading\nconcept that \"the total resources available will\nalways be limited\"( para 7), for the educational\nsystem, which it feels should be a foremost priority\nin Government funding; and believes that one sector of education should not have to suffer so that\nanother may be improved.\nPolicy\n1. Nursery Education (Section 3).\nICU welcomes the advances to be made in the\nprovision of nursery education, but considers it\nessential that a commitment is made to providing\nfull-time places for children of two-income families,\nrather than simply catering for the needs of the\nnon-working mother (para. 25),\n2. Sejcondary Education (Section 4).\nICU applauds the proposed improvement and\nexpansion of special schools for handicapped children and the special building programme to\nimplement these aims (paras. 41-43), but is disappointed that no mention is made of welfare and\ncounselling in secondary schools particularly in\nview of the raising of the school leaving age,\n3. Teacher Education (Section 8, etc.).\nICU welcomes the provisos for \"help and sup-port\" during the period of probation and for release for in-service training in at least one-fifth of\nthis period; ICU also regards the suggestion of\nlightened time-tables and use of trained, professional tutors during this period as good ideas\n(para. 68).\nHowever, ICU regards as unsatisfactory the White\nPaper's vague and anomalous muttering s about\nteacher supply and the projected cutback in college\nof education places available, by at least 50 per\ncent (para. 150), which would almost certainly\nindicate a vast increase in the numbers of inappropriately and inadequately trained post-graduate\ncertificate teachers and married women return ers teaching in nursery and primary schools. The undesirable implications of this are clear.\n4. Further and Adult Education (Section 12).\nICU realises the White Paper's failure to outline\na comprehensive scheme of post-achoo l education,\nand notes the inadequacy of the few skimpy references to adult education. ICU notes the implied\nestablishment of the A level exam as a suitable\ncriterion for predicting future performance in edu-cation. These considerations make nonsense of the\nWhite Paper's claim to recognition of the need \"to\nmake good for individuals the absence or loss of\nearlier opportunities and to encourage the renewal\nof knowledge and skills made obsolete by the\nexplosion of knowledge and the impact of technology on a rapidly changing environment\" (para.\nICU regards the Dip. H.E. as an ill-con!ce i ved and unwelcome corruption of past plans for two-year degrees, and particularly rejects the implication in the White Paper that the Dip. H.E. should\nbe a terminal qualification (para. 112) and that\nthere shou id be a2' A' level entrance requirement.\nICU believes that the Dip. H.E. should only be\naccepted for entry into teacher education when it\nhas included units of the theory and practice of\neducation.\n6. Universities.\nICU notes with alarm the proposed cut-back in\nthe projected number of university places and in\nthe annual growth rate of funding on the higher\neducation sector from 61 per cent (1961-72) to\n5 per cent (1972-1982) (para 168).\nICU condemns the Government for not only refusing to end the waste and inequity of the binary\nsystem, but instead retaining it and sharpening and\nintensifying the binary division. In this context ICU\nopposes the attempt to isolate the Universities and\nestablish them as an elitist minority, by defining\nthe university sector as the \"world of scholarship,\nresearch and invention\" (para. 1 0 7 ) ; and the implications of increasing the exclusiveness of the\nuniversity sector by reducing numbers, making\nentry more difficult and by trying to fob off working-class children with diversions and lowered expectations, e.g. the Dip. H.E. rather than a degree.\nICU notes, with disappointment, the refusal of\nthe Government to accept its responsibility to provide a higher proportion of residential places, and\nregards the White Paper as vague and inconclusive\nin its few references to student accommodation.\nICU welcomes the intention to provide, if pos-sib le, courses \"within reasonable reach\" of their\nhomes for part-time students, but notes, with grave\nmisgivings, the White Paper's view that there is\n\" a need for a higher proportion of full-time students to be based at home\", and rejects entirely\nthe concept of the regional is ation of intake.\nICU condemns the proposed cut-back in the proportion of post-graduate students from 19 per cent\nin 1971-72 to 17 per cent in (1976-77) (para.\n134).\n7. ICU notes the absence of any reference to\nprogress in methods of assessment or involvement\nof students in determination of -curricula at any\nlevel of education.\nConclusion\nICU feels that change in the education system\nshould be directed towards establishing an overall\ncomprehensive system of higher education. ICU\nconsiders the White Paper inconclusive, vague, and\ninherently non-progressive, and entirely directed\ntowards cutting costs, rather than expanding and\nimproving education.\nOn these grounds and those outlined above ICU\nrejects the vast majority of the White Paper.\nInstructions to NUS Exec.\n(1) To inform the mass of students about the\nWhite Paper and its implications to er v courage feedback from students on the whole question of educational philosophy.\n(2) To trace the developments on this question\nand to keep CO's fully informed.\n(3) To investigate alternatives to present and\nproposed qualifications, e.g. A fe vel s and Dip, H.E. and methods of assessment. (Report?).\n(4) To liaise with NUS in investigating and\npressing for, improvement of welfare and counselling systems in secondary schools.\nTo CO's.(1) To discuss with College Authorities, and as\nfar as possible, gain their agreement, on policy,\nparticularly with reference to\n(a) Accommodation,\n(b) Rejection of the Dip. H.E.,( c) Rejection of the regional is ation of intake,\nand\n(d) Resistance to cut-bj(ck s in post-graduate\nnumbers.\nWAGE FREEZE\nWage Freeze\nConference (ICU)\nDeplores the system of wage restraint (Phase 2)\nthat has been introduced by the Tories with the\nsupport of Labour, and the significant silence of\nthe Union leadership, to coincide with the price\nrestraint that allows the price of all food, all\nforeign goods, all goods with international fixed\nprices and any goods that the manufacturers claim\nhave had cost increases, to rise without hindrance.\nNotes the struggles of some sections of the low\npaid, for instance, the hospital workers and the\ngas workers, to gain higher wages. (Even at a time when Heath is trying to persuade them that\nPhase 2 is in their own interest). Also the important efforts of students to obtain higher grants.\nBelieves (1} That this is an attempt by the ruling\nclass to solve one of its major problems, the decline\nin profit margins, at the expense of the working\nclass. That is to eat into the income of workers\nwith rising prices while making it illegal for them\nto attempt to get larger incomes.\n(2) That such struggles for higher wages and\ngrants are the main forces acting against the legislation at the moment, and that these struggles\nmust be actively supported, and broadened where\npossible, in order to break through this legislation.\nMandates \u2014 the Executive (1) To give support\nin the form of nationally co-ordinated publicity to\nthe struggle of such locally based groups, particularly when their own unions are failing to do this,\nwith a view to general ising the struggle from\nsimply the economic necessities of higher wages\nto the more far reaching e ffe pt of breaking and\nthus making inoperable this wage restraint.\n(2) To co-ordinate activities with the NUS, to\nattempt to show to school kids the effects of their\nactions in the specific struggle of the hospital\nworkers this winter.\n(3) To do everything possible to influence such\norganisations as the LCD TU, and rank and file\nshop stewards committees to get a basis for mass\nunited class action.\n\u2014 all CO's(1) To liaise with such local groups\nand to use both union facilities and union finance\nto support their struggle,\n(2) To use NUS as focal point for information\nboth by sending them details of the local situation\nand distributing suf ch information as comes from\nNUS about other areas.\nAUTONOMY\nPolicy\n1. Conference considers that complete constitutional, financial and political autonomy of student\nunions is a fundamental right and is therefore not\nnegotiable.\n2. That student unions can only be controlled by\nthe students and therefore no interference by college authorities, government or any other outside\nbodies is to be tolerated.\n3. That democratic control by the student membership alone ot~each union is the only acceptable\nform of control of the union. This also applies to\namendment or replacement of the .constitution of\nthe union and its financial affairs.\n4. That autonomy by its nature is reflected in\nthe activity of the relevant CO.5. That the achievement of autonomy of student\nunions is not an end in itself but is a necessary\nbasis for further action in defence of our standard\nof living and interests to ensure freedom of organisation and action,\n6. We must be prepared to repel any government attack when it comes.\n7. That the achievement of autonomy by individual CO's will put us in a much stronger position\nto meet any renewed government attack on our\nautonomy.\n8. That the struggle for autonomy is a local and\nnational action. Therefore the declaration of autonomy by a student union can only take place\naccording to the situation of the union and the\ndegree of understanding among its members of the\nneed for autonomy as a step towards an even\nstronger union.\n9. That it is a waste of time trying to secure\npromises from the Labour Party or MP's to support Student Union autonomy as such promises are\nworthless. Autonomy will only be achieved through\naction by students.\n10. That no negotiations with the government\ncan take place without the democratic mandate of\nan Emergency Conference.\nCampaign\nIn accordance with Policy 5 and 8 the campaign for full autonomy of individual CO's cannot\nbe separated from other actions taken by unions\nand the need for autonomy will manifest itself in\nthe course of other campaigns. Therefore action for autonomy will be taken on a local level when\nthe situation demands the need and makes such\naction possible. The form such action should take\nmust of necessity be determined by the local con-ditions.\nThe best way to fight for autonomy is to exercise\nit, that means Student Unions should take any\npolitical actions they wish, such as making political payments, the student body nationally has to\nact in solidarity against any resulting attacks or\nvictim is at ions on the Unions concerned.\nInstructions\n1. To Exec\nTo give full and unconditional support to all\njn ions taking any action to declare themselves\nautonomous or struggle against their CA's on any\nissue.\n2. To Exec\nTo urge and encourage all CO's to take action\nto fight for autonomy as soon as possible,\n3. To Exec & CA G Not to enter into negotiations with the government on the subject of autonomy without the democratic mandate of an Emergency Conference.\nVIETNAM\nConference (ICU)\nNotes (1) The signing of a peace/cease fire\nagreement between Nixon and representatives of\nthe PR G.(2) US'continuing aid to the puppet regime; US fleet remaining in Indochinese waters and US bases remaining in Thailand (both constant\nthreats to resume hostilities); continuing rearmament of the puppet army; transformation of US\ntroops into \"civilian advisers\"; the increase in\nSaigon's police terror.\n(3) The proposal to send in \" police\" forces\nfrom capitalist countries to ensure that the communists get a \"fair deal\". Believes (1) That a step forward has been made\nfor the Indochinese people in this agreement which\nremoves the American military presence.\n(2) The features in Note (2) illustrate that a lasting peace has not been agreed upon, merely a change in the distribution of forces in the area.\n(3) That such military supervision Jcannot be\nrelied upon, to preserve anything but the status\nquo.\n(4) That in such a situation all possible international support for the final victory of the people\nin Indochina achieving self-determination, is still\nessential.\nCensures the Executive \u2014\u2022 for actively opposing\nthe development of the ISC (the only movement\nin this country based on a lasting solidarity pos i tion) in its first major public action after the\nfounding conference which the Exec supported,\nbacked by the NUS conference in Margate.\nInstructs the Executive to a/ctively support the\nright of the Vietnamese people to decide their own\nfuture by participating in the building of the ISC\nand consistently campaign with the ISC for solidarity with the Vietnamese people until final victory\nover the forces of Imperialism.\nAll CO's(1) to support the ongoing solidarity\nactivities of the ISC.\n(2) To attempt to set up local ISC groups in\ntheir own areas.\nYOU'RE\nALL\nINVITED!\nOn Saturday, 3 rd February, there is to be a meeting of London students\non the Murray Report. Any student is welcome to go, and each has equal\nvoting status.\nThe decision to hold such a meeting was taken by UL US RC at its\nmeeting on December 4 th, where there was a heated discussion on the rights of all students attending to\nfull speaking and voting rights.\nShould you wish to go, but in the\nmonths since November have completely forgotten what the Murray Report is or said, copies maybe bought from Dillon' s price \u00a31.00, or\ncopies of the special issue of \" Sen net\" which contains all the relevant\ninformation are again available, free\nof charge, from the Union or Felix office.\nThe meeting will be held at the\nUL U building in Male t Street.\nPAPERBACK\nBOOKS\nREVIEW\nBiggies: Foreign Legionnaire\nby Captain W.E. Johns (Armada 20p)I'm told that once you've read one\nBiggies thrill-packed adventure you've\nread the lot, and you know all there is\nto know about Biggies, Ginger, Bertie\nand Al gy \u2014 this I can believe. How ever, I must admit that I thoroughly\nenjoyed this book. The plot was simple\nand straightforward and certainly didn't hang about. At20p for 160 pages, excellent entertainment.\nThe Modern Crossword Dictionary\nby Norman G. Pulsford (Pan, 50p) If \" doing\" crosswords is your pen-chant, this is the book for you. You will\nfind films, novels, plays and fictional\nand historical characters in it as well as\nsong titles, pop groups, animals, birds,\ninsects ad nausea m...in fact,\neverything required to reduce to a fraction of the time the effort necessary to\ncomplete a puzzle.\nThe Red Towers of Granada\nby Geoffry Trease (Puffin 25p)A boy is turned away from his home\nas a leper, is saved by the outlawed Jews\nand goes questing through Spain for a mysterious Golden Essence that will\nsave England's Queen Eleanor from\ndeath. Hot stuff with a really excellent\nbeginning where our hero experiences\na strange and terrible thing \u2014 his own funeral service!\nThe Red Steer\nby Wade Smith (Fontana, 20p) John Wayne and his devotees, this is\nwhat you've been waiting for \u2014 if, like\nmyself, all those revised westerns on the\nTV have put you off the ranch for ever,\nsteer well clear, for Wade Smith has\nnothing for you. The story is slow and\ntired, very much like the characters it\nattempts to portray, and this is not\nalleviated by the hackneyed plot and\npredictable ending.\nThe 8th Fontana Book of Great Ghost\nStories (Fontana, 25p) Exactly what it says \u2014 ghost stories\nby some excellent writers. The book is\nworth reviewing for the first story alone,\n\"The Haunted Haven\". Ghostly figures\nrowing wrecked boats through the\npounding surf, returning in the early\nhours of the morning leaving only footprints in the sand \u2014 terrifyingly real.\nDAVID HOB MAN "
