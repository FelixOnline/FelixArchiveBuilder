These characteristics describe probably the most elusive member of the Mines Union. Where is Jane s? \u2014 this is a familiar cry at boat\nclub outings, morning lectures and even coffee sessions, Dick is an unassuming third year Mining Geologist with an unruffled manner, who\nBahss a hobby of arriving a little after time \u2022 very time. Richard Hat tel Jane s came in xo being on 26'h May, 1929, at Barnet. He began his education in a convent) where he kept them guessing for three years before he left and recommenced his education at St. Michael College, Hito hen. Hie main interest while at college was cricket and he\ngained a place on the1 st. XI at the early ape of fifteen. He left to go to Battersea Polytechnic and - started' another of his hobbies.^ . cross oo un tr.s running, which led him to a. distinguished\" career with Hearne Hill Harriers. It is interesting to: i ote that Dick still enjoys a runaround Hyde\npp w tr in the evening s.Dio k did his National Service in the ranks of' the i5ng in e ers; stationed* mainly at Salisbury. Unlike most soldiers his sparetime was sp tint climbing in Scotland, though on one auspicious occasion he found time to turnout for an fi'e my' Seven aside competition. On. release from the Army Dick spent three months tree planting with the Forestry Commission, and it was while working here that Dick realized his career, the advent u rous outdoor life of a Mining Geologist I To a oh i eve this ambition he returned to Battersea where he took Inter B. So. and in1951 o a me as a freshman to the Mines In his first year he boxed in the inevitably victorious Mines team, but he was soon to discover that the energies were best spent on the' rive.1 Iri his first year he rowed7 in I.e. First iKi gh t and last year wielded a trusty blade at3. this year Presidency of the Mines placed him on the horns of a dilemma \u2014 no work or no rowing. Reg r etta bly he chose the latter, and now his little sparetime is spent mountaineering with girlfriends, the odd trot in the Park to keep fit and, on rare occasions, on the Squash, court. His only regret is that although he has rowed in three Morphy eights, victory has so far eluded film. Dick takes his job as President of the Mines with all seriousness and that worried look frequently seen on his face, half hidden behind his huge ' American executive' spectacles, often means something is being planned for the Union. His use of these spectacles and the well practised eh ange of intonation when he is about to aska question are well known to those who meet him on\ncommittee. Pew people know of his chivalrous behaviour to tue first la cv miner. On the af tei noon of her arrival he bought a large bouquet of roses. Having found her, he made one of his best speeches and with a flourish presented the bouquet This was followed by ah invitation to tea in that len of iniquity, room 54 of the New Hostel. Dick's cultural interests include music, poetry( especially Rupert Brooke), mountain literature and also a keen interest in South Africa. He likes other people's cigarettes, late night outings, a vagrant life, a pint in the\nbar, suede creepers,, wine and song. He dislikes his own oi gare j ites, secretaries, early morning outings and' turnips. THE DRAMATIC SOCIETY THE HOLLOW After a first night of disturbance, the Christmas\nproduction be.ca;:.e quite a successful affair. It is difficult to bel.ii-.-ve in Agatha Christie for a moment:\nnevertheless it wu s entertaining to watch the killer being singled out from amongst the suspects. It may\nbe said that for a light production this play was not\ncompletely exploited in its humorous passages, which\nji oba bly led to the tendency of the audience to laugh\n::ut cf place.\nThe Lobster.? fa\u00ab s*t was excellently contrived, and the stage\nmanagement good: but a gremlin must have ere\u00bbtinto the make-up box when the time came to prepare the\nelder characters. On the whole the standard oi acting was high, and\nthe complete absence of prompting most satisfactory. Ian Duff and Shirley Holman acted convincingly-and\nclearly, the latter giving a rather clever Impression\n>H neurosis. The elder couple were not quite so con-v iq eing. Tony Peacock who also produced the piece,?>.* i. red to have occasional difficulty in interpreting the part of a retired Sahib, and Jean Osborne, who was\ndelightfully amusing, appeared at times to be on the\n\u2022a jr j 'nk of joining in with the general laughter Fat\n\u2022jJ El Jt/ on and Barbara Harris played sympathetically pa j^ ta\n,'vt j f 'ch in some respects were complementary': pitying boredom on one hand, and desire on the other. The\nfocus of these emotions was Edward Ao kate ii r this awkward, countrified personality was well put across\nby Alan Daves, though it is well perhaps not to enquire\nho\u00bb he managed this. John Harding and Sheila Taylor were restricted to\nbrief but well applied appearances; and Martin Jacob\nand Malcolm Amos is a de adequate police detectives. The joy of the evening was the film star, played\nby Ruth Barrett. Her appearances had a rather startling effect at times, for which her transformation from\nthe garb of a nun was no doubt responsible. One\nwonders what I. C.W. A. will manage next-B..a. MUSICAL SOCIETY CONCERT\nThis year the Choir Concert began with some\nsuperb playing by the Jacques String Orchestra in the Concerto Grosso in E Minor by Vivaldi. this was followed by \"Rejoice in the Lamb\" by\n-Benjamin Britten. The words are taken from a poem\nby Christopher Smai-w, and reading through them makes\none wonder what inspired Britten to set them to music.\nThat it is an inspired setting there is no doubt.\nThe choir had obviously worked very hard on this piece and was able to give some of its finest and\nnost well-controlled singing. Although this was\nby no means a first performance, many in the audience\nwere hearing it for the first time; modern music\nmight be more popular if all first performances wire\ntip to this standard.\ni The Carols were attacked with usual vigour,\nthe last one by the audience as well as the choir,\nand the concert was continued with the Adagio for Strings by Samuel Barber. A good peri\"orman ce, but not as masterly as the earlier items, of Faure'i Reluiem,concluded the concert.\nThe conductor, Dr. E.H. F^ own, proved himself\nmore than capable in exercising control over the\nchoir and orchestra. Of the soloists the baritone.\nRftnlrine BusHby, deserves special mention for his noble\\tone and fine control. The soprano, Pauline\nBrockless, had a powerful Toioe and sang clearly through a difficult part, but at times the audience\nwere left in doubt as to whether her intonation was\ncorrect.\nFor those who missed, this concert an opportunity\nwill be given, in one of the Thursday Recitals, Feb.\n11 th., of hearing a repeat performance.\n\n"

    "content": "PLUMP UD D/ NG EIGHTS\nOn Saturday,19 th Deoember, the first three I. C.B.C. eights joined with six from Thames, one\nfrom Midland Bank and one from Kings in the annual Christmas handicap rao e organised by Thames R.C. The rao e was rowed from Chl s wick Steps to the Thames R.C. flagstaff, and the handicaps so devised that the eleven crews were nicely bunched together at Hammersmith. This is a fine sight to spectators on the bank, but an absolute nightmare for cox es of faster boats trying to pass through the congestion ahead. The 1 st VIII, as has become almost traditional in this event, were taking their sweaters off when\nthe order was given to start, and so were a little delayed in getting off the mark. Onoe away, they had quite an adventurous row, on one occasion mount ing the stern canvas of one of the slower Thames\nboats and coming within inches of impaling the cox on their prow. Nevertheless In between' incidents' they had a very good row, and were only a few seconds slower than the Thames I in spite of It all. I. C.B.C. II also had their adventures, though doubtless their cox' s vocabulary proved equal to the occasion. It was left to I. C.B.C. Ill with a good handicap, one crew to pass, and a plot of beer waiting for them at the boat house to eschew all hindrances and make sure of finishing in front of the flotilla. The rest of the proceedings are hidden in a mist of beer, turkey, plum pudding and the traditional flying rolls, but it was observed that a major shape of the third VII I's trophy was consumed by the other or ews to the benefit of row-ing in general and the Thames R.C. Plum Pudding Dinner in particular. ANNOUNCEMENT1.0. Choir is now rehearsing for the next\nConcert,' which, will be on March 18 th.

All enquiries will be published\nin the strictest confidence.\nHOCKEY\nI.C. beat Leeds University. I.C.:5; Leeds:1. On the last day of the term, I.C. and Leeds University teams faced each other on a foggy afternoon, with full stomachs. The I.C. team was a mixture of regular players and some U.L. players, though this time the yoo mbi ned better than on other well remembered occasions. The game had an even start and picked up speed in next to no time. Leeds right side attacked strongly on many occasions but Gillett and Taylor combined well at fullback and held them at bay. Our forwards soon found their feet, and Ta\u00bbler; and\nPower scored before halftime; Leeds did not. The second half opened with four Umpires to b over the foggy field not that this made much difference. Leeds managed to get a goal quickly, out could not score again. The play was now characterised by the brilliant attack of Power and Hayes, the brilliant midfield play of Cox and Hayes, and the constant verbal encouragement and advice from T^yler and Hayes\nPower scored twice, and H eppard got in a quick one\njust to make sure. The score was not a really accurate indication, for we did not deserve to win by so large a margin. Still, having lost to Kingston Grammar School a couple of dey s before, the game\ndid mu oh to revive the spirit of the team.\nSTEPHENSON CUP: R.S. M.:0;R. C.S.:0.A cold but fast game. Much midfield play due to weak forward lines and stronger half lines. Nobody ever really looked like scoring. RUGGER\nThe Rufc&Br Club resumed its normal activities after the tour with four matches against Kings College. The first three KVs won and the fourth lost, Hy kin returned to the first team after his long absence through injury, and showed that he has lost none of his skill in making openings. During the first half, playing with a strong win d,I.C.3 cored one try by Arthur s, which was converted by lewis, this w \u00abs the only score of the game.\n. In the afternoon the Club adjourned to Twi cken ham.

Hyd.\nHeitd of the Dept. of Os cula to logy and Animal Behaviour, Imperial College. Introduction. The material which constitutes the body of this Report has been gathered over a number of Terms during which the male approach to the Hop\nhas been closely studied. Part1. Classification of Hp po types in Oo relation to Attendance Motivation. Exhaustive investigation has revealed that there is a close co relation between the different classes of Hopo type and the Attendance Motivation Factors to which they are subject: Motivation can be broadly classified under the following headings:-a. Dancing. b. Fernino-se quan ce.c. Innate Athletic is m.d. Psychopathic. a. Dancing. The Dancing Motivation Factor, though frequently of importance in the evolution of a Hopot y pe, is never of lasting endurance., This is readily understood when the Floor Density Factor is considered in relation to the Female Dancing Comp e ten ce Index. These tend to turn the Embryo\nHopo type either into a Hopophobe (whose consequent absence from all Hops removes him from the scope\nof this Report), or aH bp ophile of another Type\nclassification. Time ( Proportional to no. of Hops)\nTypical graph of Hopophobe behaviour. This graph moves in a cycle, the commencement being coincident with the first h \u00b0P of each term. b.F eml nose ou ance. This is the most common and most easily understood Attendance Motivation Factor. The\nvarious degrees of Intention Intensity are simply a personal factor response to the First Law of Sex Dynamics( which states:\" Life without a Woman\nis Impossible\"), and also an Incredulity Factor response to the Second Law ( which states:\" Life with a Woman is Intolerable\"). o. Innate Athletic is m., This motivation Factor is divisible into two\nI subclasses static and mobile. The Stato type is invariably to be found clustered round the doors, being wholly concerned: w l th a feat of endurance which consists of standing J solidly throughout the Hop. Great care, however,\nshould betaken to distinguish this Type from recon no it ring Selective Fe mino types who not infrequently lurk amid them.\nThe Moto type is the exact opposite in that he\nnever rests from the moment of hie arrival to the termination of proceedings. Characteristic feature* are his low Fe mino Selective capability, exe crats la dancing, and profuse perspiration. d. Psychopathic. The Types included under this heading area heterogeneous assortment whose only common factor is Suffering. This may be in a Generative or a Passive Phase. The latter will be considered first. It is exhibited by the Sad is to type whose whole enjoyment\ncentres round observing the sufferings of other Hop frequenter s. This ol as s probably overlaps the Stato type to some extent. The Generative Phase shows two facets, Intro punitive and Ex tro pun it l ve. Types motivated by the former factor continue to frequent Hops though detesting the records played, the Ladies invited, etc. Types motivated by the latter appear to be\nsuffering under grievances. They vent their spite upon their unfortunate partners via their dancing and conversation. These Types are not infrequently sufferers from inherent sex inferiority complexes. V/e have no hesitation in printing this Abstract of a weighty and learned Report. A second Report is to follow in a short time\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX LETTERS TO THE EDITOR\nDear Sir,I read with interest the article, in the Christmas\nedition of \" Felix\" on the new dance - The Trudge. I was d is a p]om ted, however, at the omission of the\n\"Divergent , - steps which prove very useful on a crowd-ej dance floor, as in these steps one does not move\nbaCK Wu ras or forwards. The steps, which are extremely\nsimile, are as follows CONKENCE, FEET TOGETHER, FACING PARTNER\nBAR ONE Put right foot 6\" straight forward\nr. AR T.'.G Put left foot 6\" straight backward\nBAR THREE Put right foot a further6\" forward\nBAR FCIR Put left foot a further6\" backward\nCONTINUE AD. LIB. LADY CONTRA.\nCne further comment I should like to make, is that\nthe Trudge still suffers from one complexity : one must\nbe able to differentiate between one's left foot and\none's right. I should be glad if someone could inform\nme of any dance, where this is not necessary, as this seems to be the basic trouble of many aspiring dancers\nat this college. Yours faithfully, G. Rudge..\nDear Sir, re proposed constitutional amendment\nV.e,m common with many others, were shocked by the\ncontempt for democracy and for Union opinion demonstrated by your correspondent '..'.P. Goss, afc rmer Union Secr et ary in this letter(27:11:53) \u00ab We respectfully submit the following points for the Union's consideration. Firstly, Mr. Goss professes to adduce new evidence\nin support of the proposal, but his letter presents no\nfacts or arguments which were not - less laboriously offered and rejected at the U. G.M. Secondly, it is fundamental to a democratic system\nthat the power to vote on Council be subject to election. Retiring officers are entitled to stand for reelection to Council; failure to secure it indicates not\nthat they are regarded as unsuitable, but that others\nare considered more suitable. The suggestion that\nthey are not usually prepared to stand speaks for itself. Thirdly, Council members are elected not for their professed support for a particular scheme ( vi de: \"butter\nration\") but because their record indicates that they\nwill act in the interests of the Union member*\u2022 In\nthis sense Council must be representative. It should\nbe emphasized that, whereas during their term of office the Executive represent 2/3 of the electorate, in the\nfollowing year this proportion would be reduced to 1/3 -i.e.a minority. Fourthly, under the present Constitution, Council has power to avail itself of the experience of former\nofficers by inviting them to attend its meetings as nonvoting observers. Furthermore, it is very unlikely that, in any one year, there will be no member of Counc il who has not already served on it for a year.\nFinally sir, Mr. Goss's concluding paragraph in di cates that neither he nor the Joint Council had given\nthe proposal much thought before submitting it to the\nUnion. He trust that the Union will persist in its refusal to act as a rubber stamp and will reject overwhelmingly any further attempt to subvert our (admit-ted ly imperfect, democracy of administration. Yours etc . ,\nN. F.E.B. S. S. Dear Sir, The financial stability of the average student today is conspicuous, as they say, by its absence. Too often, alas, it is a case of \"can I touch you for five bob, old sock?\" and \"Might manage half a crown, Jack.\" This fluid state of affairs, with a string of people borrowing from each' other, often going in circles, is too unstable. May I suggest that we bring order and some sort of i security to this financial exchange?\nThe ideal thing would be a small fund, with a cubbyhole and pay-window somewhere in the Union. This will receive contributions from all members\nat beginning of Term when the grants are coming\nin, and later on if conditions permit. The deposits will be entered up, and when the time come3 paid out in predetermined amounts, say in fortnightly instalments. Overdrafts,( inevitable) will be given at the discretion of the Fund or against some sort of security.9 If the idea receives support, and the Union can find some space, I am willing to offer my services as Hon. Treasurer for the Fund. Yours sincerely, Delta Chi Kappa.\nHI C/ Higher Education in Montreal find Loudon.\nPerhaps it would be wiser to start with account ing the en vi rome nt that the student finds himself in in both cities, and then proceed into a ore det ailed analysis. In London, the student is thrown off on his own at10:30 p.m. or thereabouts, THUS i \u00a3 he would successfully waste the evening, he must at an\nearly age learn how to lend for i.i..o eli and find spiritual an joy ment so as to complete the 'lay;\nwhereas in Montreal the student leads a more s nel te red existence, he does not find himself unceremoniously ejected into+ he streets until2 s30a.m.1 by which time he is generally in a properly aesthetic state of mind and being.3 ut, and this is most important, he develops endurance and ability to face the elements. He must, or freeze ignobly in some lonely gutter. To take an average situation: the student has staggered forth from the closing club with its homey atmosphere of stale beer and cigarette smoke into the cold winter's night. There is. a chill wind blowing, the snow is whirled this way and that in quick swirls along the streets. It is below zero, and not ning except many people staggering ou* of o lub s is \u2022o be seen. Instinctively he is able to face the situation, and he staggers off to a combination restaurant club, where he drinks for a few more hour still'. be transport system resumes operation. Tn us he\narrives home at a nearly hour, and after a brief sleep is refreshed and ready fort ne day's toil. The general staple of the student is the same\non both sides of the Atlantic; beer( or ale).3ut\" over there\" the student also has affinity for Hye, w nic his a Canadian speciality. However,\nbeer A is not t..e same as beer3 which is not the same as beer. Trie Canadian beer is served cold. It is much gassier than \"he Sng li sh beer, though not so much as the Danish or German lager. It is stronger in taste, and two or three ti:i es as alcoholic. It is served in bottles of 11 and 22 oz\ncapacity, known respectively as pints and quart s,t 'hus it is difficult to ma Ice any comparison bet we en the Canadian and he 3 rit isn product; they are different by\" nature, and each requires its own app roa cu and s'ate of mind for proper app re cia ion. To the south of Canada lies the States. American beer is not wort u considering, being weak in taste, flavour and variety., Vhen extremely o old it makes a mild and thirst quenching beverage, trio ug n some people prefer water. At tn is point it. ill oe well to state that' student' the present article refers to the\nstudent engineer. Common to both sid as of the* l antic it is t ne engineer who is rul yet ou ed wit ii the' e amp us so it it', and it is the engineers acting in concert that are responsible for tue\nstudent body \u2022being generally re^ar do v,it:i suspicion oy all respectable and law abiding citizens. At both places, trie life or t..e student engineer is not all beer and laughter. It aa'sits serious mba ents.

We appreciated part i cula rly the \"Oo-oo game\", in which Peacocke made a hit. Kykin excelled at the cycle races, but we are confident\nthat the articles of furniture concerned have since been\nrepaired.. The remaining two Rugger matches had to be\ncancelled owing to hard ground, but we played the other\ngame instead. In the first match we were losing 1-0\nat half-time when our hosts passed round a bottle of\nliquid. This electrified our team and Spooner scored\ntwice in the next five minutes, but the final score\nwas 3-2 against I.C. 'tie gained our revenge in the second\ngame. The score stood at 1-1 for a long time, but after a ding-dong struggle Kitchener clinched the issue with a35 yards piledriver from a difficult angle, after a passing movement in which\n_ HtM WHO e< Mt\u00bb*Mr aw** , T \u2022TAICTT \u2014\nwe view r to THC\nHAS06, A \u00bbtt\u00bb\nIS MUDS. twit* *fiM Pi. es)\nHykin and iVe ale indulged in same skilful inter-passing.\nOn the fifth day\nPeacocke went to bed,\nit was rumoured, for the first time, and\nthus missed the visit to the Oranjebocm\nBrewery in Rotterdam.\nThis was an unqualified success and\neveryone was given a cigarette lighter and\na warm feeling of bon-homie to commemorate\nit. The Delft students gave magnificent entertainment\nwhich included, an\nofficial dinner at\nwhich Hykin and Kitchener upheld, the cult ural standard of I.C. with delightful speeches in evidently\nunderstandable Dutch.\nA feature of this dinner was that the\nserviettes were set\nalight and thrown into\nthe air.

    "content": "FELIX Felix3 Mil; NEWSPAPER OF IMPI'RIAl COLLECT\nEditor: G.H. Starmer Circulation: 1200.\nHarding over the 3 d lt or ship, I would like to thank the Editorial Board for their ready and\nwilling help. Though all but one of them were\nnew to\" their jobs, they picked up the strings in j no time at all and brought speed and order to I the u any complexities that go to make FELIX. It only remains for me to wish the new 3 d it or, G.H. Star mer of Guilds, and the 3o ard the beaU\nof everything in their peculiar, enjoyable task. D.C. Kale.\nafter taking over as editor of FELIX in the middle\nof last summer term, Mr. D. Kale found himself with a staff of only three at the beginning of the new session.\nBut FELIX appeared on the second Friday of the autumn\nterm and by Christmas he had gathered together almost\na full board. This is no mean achievement, especially\nwhen one discovers that Mr. Kale turned his pen to\nrecording such diverse activities as debates and\ncarnivals -\u2022 and then found time for verse. Our thanks\ngo to him for all the time he has given to FELIX and\nwe look forward to receiving contributions from him as\neditor em^rit i1^; A new editor; a new term, i. nd whereas the\nautumn term is regarded by some a time of settling down to work, the spring term is thought by some to\nbe the time when all and sundry should play an active\npart in whatever goes on in the union. At the same time,\nthose who have managed to get through the autumn term\nwithout bothering about the union, resolve to work even\nharder to avoid getting involved in union activities. Their lack of interest is bemoaned by their more\nactive fellows,but is there not cause for rejoicing in their non-participation ?\nAt present, anyone belonging to a few of the\ncollege clubs and societies gets far more value from\nthe union than his five pound subscription. The\ndifference between value received and money given, is entirely due to the generosity of the less active amongst\nas in not using the whole ( if any) of their subscription.\nIf the membership of each club were to increase,\nit would be much more difficult to get a place in a team\n(since, because of the very large number of non-participants at present, there must be quite a few who\nwould turn out to bi more than average players at the\nsport they chose to play.) Gone will be the opportunity\nof travelling on a union subsidy, of enjoying an\nafternoon of playing the game.\nThe same applies to an increase in spectators\n\u2022atoning the various college teams do battle. We could\nno longer travel to Harlington and be certain of our\nparticular vantage point for some of the best free\nentertainment available. Kren in the General Studies\nlectures, it would be impossible to obtain the same\npleasure if60% of the college went along. And imagine\nthe queue for tickets if everyone decided to o \u00bb to the\nhops.\nSo instead of a e or ying the lack of enthusiasm ox\nMaae benefactors of the 'union-man' , let us wish\nthem luck in their hard work so that, unlike many ox\ntheir predecessors, they do not go stale before thai* testing time.\nPB LIX congratulates two of it sex Sdl tors on\n\u2022 their engagement :\nJohn Midgley to Cinders Freeman (ex-R.C.M.)

Spooner.\nCLOSED FOR CLEANING\nThe Union Lounge, it has been announced, will be\nclosed every alternate Friday for cleaning and polishing\nthe floor. This causes slight inconvenience to members,\nbut it is unavoidable. Complaints about this resulted,\ntwo years ago, in the Executive adopting the policy\" If they v. ant it dirty they can have it dirty\", which is not\nfavoured by the present Executive. The choice of Friday\nis inevitable after a little thought. The polishing proCess takes a certain amount of time, and as the men knock\noff at 4\n- p.m., the time is also fixed. After repeated\nwaxing and polishing it is hoped that, a presentable floor would result in a short while. New lamps in the Dining\nHall are part of the same brightening-up policy.\nVIEWPOINT Those of you with eyes must have noticed that the\nUnion has undergone a considerable face i lift i':g. Its walls and ceilings are brighter, its floor cleaner - and\ngoing to be kept clean, and the lamps in the Lower Dining\nHall are far more useful than they have ever been. Now\nthe Entrance Halls are more inviting, the lounge more lounge-able, and you can see what you are eating 3\" the Refectory.\nSo far, so good. Now for the criticism. The Lounge is a mute creature that suffers in silence.\nFew will deny that it has a life and personality all its own; even fewer that it is mute. It is nice, warm and\nquiet (except during lunchtime and Hop nights) '.v here one\ncan s it, read or Ju3t lounge in casual comfort. But this casualness, I feel, has gone a bit too far recently, amounting to downright slovenliness. Nothing is ever in place,\nclasses and teacups we find on the floor. Ashtrays slip below the settees, while the ash and matches they 8 \"\u2022 supposed to contain are strewn all over the floor ar,;\n~ \u2022!\ntables. Newspapers sprawl carelessly on the seat j,\\. hi le people are perched uncomfortably on tables. The newspapers\nand periodicals come in for really heartless treatment, and\nit is rare to find a magazine more than a few days old with\nits cover on. Why, WHT, do we have to drop our paper when\nwe get up? Is it too much effort to val ka few extra\npaces an r\" put them on the side tables? No sight is more\nfamiliar in the Lounge than the student who wanders round\nlooking for a piece of unclaimed printed paper to read.\nReturning the papers to their proper place would reduce the\nnumber of these wanderers, and increase the life-expectancy\nof the magazines as they would not then be sat on so much.\nThe rest of the Union comes in for much the same\ntreatment. Muddy feet ignore the door-mats as completely\nas if they were not there. And dripping coats wander round\nlooking at notices, chatting to people, going to the letter rack and even to the Dining Hall before turning to the clo al room. This sort of treatment is not deserving of the\nUnion. It might be all right in one's own digs, visited perhaps by a maid once a week and by the land-lady once a month, or when she smells kipper oil. But please, not in the Union, -which is used by hundreds of others.\nIs it too much to ask that we clean our shoes as we\ncome in; or that we use the ash-trays; or that vre treat\nthe papers civilly? Especially the papers. This is NOT\nregimentation. It is not even discipline. It is merely\ncan mon sense and tidiness to be exhibited in a place that we\nfrequent so often. Let us be casual, by all means. But\nlet us also be tidy. It makes life far more pleasant.\nMagnus.\nJ \u00ab\n'but it was YOUR turn J[ REFECTORY NEWS\n, The Ref eo tory has had another change of manage-ment. It had been running at a loss for almost as\nlong as anybody could remember, and three years ago\nsuccessively large annual losses \u00a35,000 and more -brought John Gardner& Co. to cut them down. This they managed to a certain extent, cutting the losses\nabout 40$. The cut was brought about partly no\ndoubt by improved efficiency and economy, but partly too by a reduction in the total number of meals served. The contrast with Mess rs. Gardner was terminated on Deo. 2 3 rd, and Mr. Mooney is the new Manag er.A great improvement was noticed last term in the quality and value of the food being served, and it is to be hoped that the new manager will continue the Improvement. An Increase in prices at this time would be disastrous, and can only result in a further drop in the number of meals\nserved. As the overheads will remain the same,\nit will mean a definite increase in percentage losses, though the absolute loss may be less. We notice that the Suggestions Book has been abs ent for along time from its normal perch. Surely this is the time to ask for, and study, more\nsuggestions from the consumers? The possibility of supplies to the Ref eo tory from Sil wood Park has been studied in great det ail by the Refectory Committee. The primary-aim was to provide vegetables, hut it is found1 that by itself this will not be very lucrative. Coupled with livestock, however, the scheme can\nbe worked very profitably, and would supply, bes ides vegetables, eggs, pork, bacon and chicken. The difficulty lias in the large initial outlay that will be Involved in getting45 acres under cultivation. The matter is being further studied. Plans for the expansion of the kitchen and the Refec tory as a whole are going ahead, with the Architect and\nMr. Mooney producing ideas. More details will be published\nlater, when finalised and approved.\n\n"
