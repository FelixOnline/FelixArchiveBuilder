There are\nenough pockets to carry a few peripherals and\npens with you, as well as enough space for a small\nsheaf of papers. That said, the bag is quite small;\ndon\u2019t expect it to carry anything more than a small\nrefill pad in addition to your laptop. In terms of\nstyle, the bag looks quite attractive when shut\n\u2013 I\u2019m not so sure about the gaudy \u2018raspberry\u2019 interior of the review piece we received, but that\u2019s\npossibly a question of personal taste. The inner\nsleeve is well cushioned and should protect your\nlaptop well. Overall, the Black Addict is very good\nat keeping your laptop safe \u2013 the combination of\nthe no-nonsense bag and memory foam sleeve\nmean you won\u2019t have to handle your notebook too\ncarefully. A very dependable option that doesn\u2019t\nlook too shabby either.\nCan you imagine a day without the internet?\nToday communication touches every aspect of\nour lives from social networking to business.\nWe exploit information technology to enhance\nthe learning experience through the use of the\ninternet, supported by online initiatives such as\npodcasts and Virtual Learning Environments.\nHowever in countries such as Morocco, Thailand, India and Nepal, social and economic\ndevelopment is restricted by a lack of communications infrastructure.\nThe Aurora project aims to provide internet\naccess to communities in rural areas, bringing\nkey social benefits and enhancing learning.\nRun by a team of students from the Electrical\n& Electronic Engineering Department, we aim\nto achieve this objective by creating wireless\nnetworks, coupling long range transmitters\nwith an existing electricity grid. The key is\nWi-Max technology \u2013 offering a range of up to\n10 km from a single router. By connecting WiMax routers in relays, we can get information\nto very remote locations.\nFounded in October 2011, the progress has\nbeen remarkable. One of our team members\nwent to Morocco last December and conducted\na location feasibility study \u2013 which proved WiMax was viable to implement in the region. We\nhave fostered excellent links in industry with\nInternet Service Providers, energy companies\nand RuggedCom \u2013 a specialist Canadian based\ncompany manufacturing Wi-Max products\nwho are one of our close industrial partners.\nThanks to fantastic support from our department (in particular Dr Kristel Fobelets) and\nsupervisor, Prof Kin Leung, a few of our team\nhad the chance to visit the RuggedCom office\nin Lancaster and see Wi-max technology in ac-tion. We successfully managed to get a transmitter on loan which will enable us test the\ntechnical feasibility of the project right here in\nLondon. Therefore, our next step is to conduct\na live field test by creating a Wi-Max network\nin Imperial College; we are in the process of\ncompleting licensing agreements for this.\nWith this and our remaining location feasibility studies just on the horizon, we believe we\nwill soon achieve our ultimate goal of enabling\nschools in communities to use our WiMax network to enhance education in the near future.\nAfter seeing this project developed so much,\njust from an idea put forward by a few stu-dents, we are sure that every one of us can\nmake a difference in this world.

Create the future.\nA new \u2018best\u2019 method for creating passwords?\n\u201cYour password will expire in 10 days. Would\nyou like to change it now?\u201d This is the message\nthat greets me when I log on to Outlook Web\nAccess. I was first told my password was going to expire at the end of January, so why have\nI not yet done so? The act itself of changing the\npassword is by no means a complex task \u2013 but\ninstead it\u2019s the creation of its replacement that\ntakes time and effort.\nThe problem is, of course, security. While\nI don\u2019t think my accounts are going to be the\ntargets of everyday hacking, I still wouldn\u2019t\nfeel comfortable leaving my emails open to\nanyone who tried \u201c123456\u201d in the password\nfield. We have all been encouraged to conjure\nup complex combinations of upper and lowercase letters, numbers and symbols, but these\ntend to be less than easily memorable. This has\nled people to possibly not bother with anything\ncomplicated, or leaving a note of their password lying around.\nNew discussion in the area, however, hopes\nto alleviate these issues greatly. Many of you\nwill be familiar with the xkcd comic about\npassword entropy, I\u2019m sure, but it seems this\nalso isn\u2019t the answer. The problem lies in finding a good balance between memorability and\nsecurity. Unfortunately, many hackers aren\u2019t\nstupid, so \u201cPa55w0rd\u201d isn\u2019t going to fit the bill\n\u2013 that and its variations would be tried in most\ndictionary attacks. \u201cP@s5w()r1}\u201d is considered much stronger, but is far less memorable.\nInstead, the solution relies on \u2018padded passwords\u2019. The concept is simple \u2013 take a fairly\nmemorable password (let\u2019s use Lond0n as an\nexample), and add a small \u2018pad\u2019 to it, increasing both the length and complexity of the finished product. In our example, we could pad\nwith \u201c.**\u201d and end up with \u201c.**Lond0n.**\u201d.\nOf course, the padding doesn\u2019t need to be the\nsame everywhere, nor does it need to be at either end. This is the key to the system \u2013 you\ncould give away the base password to anyone,\nbut as long as they don\u2019t know your pad(s) and\nwhere padding exists in the password, they still\nwouldn\u2019t be able to access your account.\nIn technical terms, there are a few factors at\nplay here. It is still highly recommended to use\na combination of alphanumeric characters and\nsymbols, as this massively increases the search\nspace that a hacker would need to test every\ncombination of. However, a hacker would only\nresort to this brute forcing when simpler measures \u2013 such as dictionary attacks \u2013 have been\nexhausted, but the padding essentially forces\nany hacking attempt into that huge domain.\nOnce this technique is being used, the biggest\nfactor in the security of your password is its\nlength, which of course the padding only helps.\nThe memorability of the password is also not\ntoo bad \u2013 \u201cLond0n\u201d by itself isn\u2019t too taxing\nfor example, and it\u2019s easy to pick a pad that\nsuits you \u2013 \u201c&*(\u201c are neighbours on the key-board, but still an effective pad. Additionally,\nthose without a great memory for passwords\ncould write down either the pad or the base\npassword without fear, as discussed before.\nIn essence, these passwords are not too different from a random, strong password with\nall the right elements. However, being easier\nto think up and remember brings them to more\npeople. Given their security, this can only be a\ngood thing.\nChris Bowers\nRelease windows hurt box office\nA joint study by researchers from Wellesley College\nand the University of Missouri has found that US\nbox office takings are largely unaffected by piracy,\nand instead point to large international release\nwindows (the time from American national releases to releases across the globe) as a significant\nfactor in decreased overall revenue for movie fran-chises. Factors identified as contributing to this\nlarge window include the need to support legacy\ntheatre systems that still depend on expensive\n35mm reels and the cost of promotional jaunts\nacross the globe for the leading cast members.\nThis probably has some relevance towards television programming as well, with top American TV\nshows often airing for the first time internationally\na few seasons after their national success. While\ninternational television operators are naturally\nwary of betting on shows that haven\u2019t been previously tested, it is only a matter of time before it\nbecomes unprofitable to even bet on successes,\ngiven the ease with which pirated versions can be\naccessed online. As the endless battles between\ncopyright owners and pirates continue, it might be\ntime for the movie industry to focus their energies\non something they can actually control.\nThe Aurora Team consists of Mehvesh\nTariq, Sriram Kannan, Giri Kesavan,\nSonal Rashmi, Jegadeesh Sithamparathas, Wayne Yeang, Minoru\nNanayakkara, Sumedha Kodamanchali and Sathesh Elangovan.\nwww.aurorawimax.co.uk\nSturdy and dependable\n\n"

    "content": "MUSIC\nAs promised, this week I will be beginning my rampage of digging up dead, old UK post-hardcore\nbands. The first band to be mentioned is, obvi-ously, Reuben. Despite their ten-year lifetime and\nnumerous outstanding releases, they failed to\ngain any mainstream success (as is the story for\nmost bands in this series). For some reason, the\ngood post-hardcore bands from the UK seem to\nall come from Surrey and Reuben are no different.\nThey formed in 1998 and their intense live\nshows made them a household name in the underground music scene, gaining a lot of fans and admiration from other bands. This continued despite\nnot releasing their first full-length until 2004. The\nthree albums they released in the following three-year period were all incredible and it\u2019s a shame\nthey didn\u2019t achieve higher levels of popularity, especially within the UK. However, I personally think\ntheir final album, In Nothing We Trust, was their\nbest. From listening to any selection of Reuben\u2019s\nsongs, you will realise that their style is incredibly\ndiverse. There are some songs you could listen to\nand not notice it\u2019s the same band at all. Some of\ntheir tracks are mellow and some (quite a lot in\nfact) are heavily pop-infused, unreconcilable with\npost-hardcore even a little bit.\nThis brings me to the reason why I prefer the\nmost recent album: because it\u2019s the rawest. Despite their diverse sound, I have to say that for\nme, I like the heavier tracks and In Nothing We\nTrust delivers forceful riffs and ridiculous drum\nsmashing by the truckload. Their widely varied\nsetlist saw them attract all different types of people to their live shows. Perhaps the most engaging\nthing about them though was their unique sense\nof humour always present in their videos and gigs\n(watch their \u2018Michael Jackson\u2019 video on YouTube).\nFor these reasons, Reuben were one of the gems\nof UK alternative rock music and all we can do\nis hope that one day they will return, but for now\ncheck out the recommendation below and come\nback next time for more UK post-hardcore thrills!\nWriter\u2019s Recommendation\nA test of what we\u2019ve learnt so far: listen to the song\n\u2018Crushed Under the Weight of the Enormous Bullshit\u2019\nand you should recognise some of the bands and albums mentioned in the song from previous lessons.\nGeorge Jeffery\u2019s\nA beginner\u2019s guide to\npost-hardcore\nLesson 6: Reuben\nFELIX Friday 17 February 2012 17\nCafe Oto\nWednesday 22 Feburary\nBe sure not to miss...\nBody/Heat\nSonic Youth bassist Kim Gordon\ngoes solo, alongside \u201cconstant in\nthe free rock universe\u201d Bill Nace,\nfollowing their collaborative tape on\nEcstatic Peace.\n\u00cd\u00f1igo Mart\u00ednez de Rituerto\nis that Bonnie \u2018Prince\u2019 Billy embodies the\nDIY approach that I cherish, and combines\nit with lyrics so distressingly fragile that one\ncannot help but connect with him. So, I urge\nall the wannabe Mumfords out there to put to\ndown their accordion and pick up a copy of\nBeware to listen to the master at work.\npresents an eerie warning to \u201cwatch out for\nmy silent thoughts\u201d. The track \u2018You Don\u2019t\nLove Me\u2019 stands out as a heart wrenching\naccount of a man who sings to his lover\n\u201cyou wouldn\u2019t pass the time with me, except\nyou\u2019re tired of all your friends\u201d. The brutal\nhonesty of Oldham\u2019s words are sometimes\ndisconcerting but, sang against a beautiful setting of lilting guitars and a choir of\nswooning backing singers, one can find a\ntheme of hope lining the album. Throughout\nthis collection of anti-love songs, he never\ngives up that his perfect woman is \u201clying\ncurled somewhere lonely\u201d waiting for him.\nI find it refreshing that Will Oldham is\na man who refuses to play the media and\npromotion game. There is little or no build\nup to an album release and this means that\neach record feels unexpected when it does\narrive. His latest album, Wolfroy Goes To\nTown, may have passed many by but it deserves to be listened to by a large audience.\nIt successfully continues his style of mixing\nhauntingly beautiful melodies with dark subjects although does not reach the heights of\nprevious releases.\nSome of my friends cannot understand why,\nas an avid listener of lo-fi New York punk, I\nwould recommend something which arguably verges on country music. My response\nB\nonnie \u2018Prince\u2019 Billy, aka Will\nOldham, is a name who should\nbe on everyone\u2019s lips. Instead,\nin the current landscape of in-die-folk/Americana he has been\noverlooked for the watered-down beige-athon\nthat is Mumford and Sons.

In an album with a general tone of moody introspective aggression,\n\u2018Hands on the Wheel\u2019 is a relatively upbeat\naffair with tight production courtesy of Best\nKept Secret.\nThe song is one of the most accessible on\nthe album and is a good introduction to the\nversatility of Schoolboy Q\u2019s rapping.

    "content": "COMMENT\nFELIX Friday 17 february 2012 15\nRCSU IS BETTER\nPaul Beaumont RCSU Vice President (Operations)\nICSM IS BETTER\nSuzie Rayner ICSMSU President\nI\nrun the inherent risk of making myself\nunpopular in writing this: and so I shall\nendeavour to explain why \u2013 as uncontro-versially as possible, but without question\n\u2013 the RCSU is better than the ICSMSU.\nFor my argument to hold, one must first accept\nthat this is a rather fucked up playing field. The\nFaculty of Medicine donate large sums of money\nto the ICSMSU. They have a paid-for-by-College\nPresident working on \u2018stuff\u2019 full-time (or, more\ncommonly, curled up on the sofa in her office\nwishing she\u2019d stuck at playing doctors and nurses\ninstead of taking a year out). If this whole \u2018Faculty Union\u2019 thing was golf, the Medics have the\nmaximum handicap of 36 whilst the RCSU are\nplaying as pros at 0. Not fair.\nAnd so, it is on this basis that I will build my\nargument. I quite happily smile and nod when a\nMedic tells me how amazing their Union is over\nRCSU. Inside, I\u2019m dying \u2013 yearning \u2013 to scream\n\u201cBUT LOOK AT THE PLAYING FIELD\u201d. I\nsomehow think they may think me mad for doing\nso, though.\nReaders of this publication will no doubt however have spotted the numerous successes of the\nRCSU this year. Autumn Ball. Oktoberfest. Made\nIn Chelsea Pub Crawl. Book Sale. Welfare Week.\nCharity Cakes Sales. Careers Talks. Alumni Dinner. Winter Ball. Science Challenge. RAG Ball.\nAll of these have been on the back of a team of\ncrack-pot scientists, working hard behind the\nscenes. No full-time staff \u2013 no labour costs. No\nthousands of pounds, flooding our accounts like\nthe torrent of vomit flowing through Reynolds.\nWhat have \u2013 with all these extra resources \u2013\nthe Medics\u2019 Union achieved then? Erm. Oh, this\nis awkward. Their social calendar is, like, \u201cpadded\u201d with the RCSU events (read: that woman in\ncharge is piggybacking the RCSU). The events\nthat the Medic Union cook up themselves \u2013 under the, may I stress, direction of paid-sabbatical\nMiss Rayner \u2013 are only as good as the RCSU\u2019s,\nand only marginally more frequent.\nAs Faculty Unions, we also handle welfare\nweeks and the rep system on behalf of the DPE.\nMany would argue that this is where the medics\nshine, with an enviable buddy scheme \u2013 something I won\u2019t deny them. I would ask though,\nif this cannot be attributed more to the fact the\nmedics have more time to be social than us hardworking scientists? Having lived with medics\nfor two years, the number of nights they stumble\nhome as opposed to walk suggests they had too\nmuch time to kill. Yes \u2013 I guess I am just jealous.\nBut then, the RCSU serves a greater purpose\nthan just this social lark the medics thrive on.\nUnlike their students, ours now have a wealth of\nopportunities open to them on graduating. Virtually any job is at your fingertips with the letters\nARCS after your name (Associateship of the\nRoyal College of Science). To this end the\nRCSU takes it upon itself to organise careers talks that will benefit our members\u2019\nfutures; we don\u2019t just act as a drain on their\nmembers\u2019 student loan by holding fancy\nbops, etc.\nAnd so \u2013 for fear of wittering on too\nmuch, I conclude as thus: ICSMSU,\nas a union, is good \u2013 but given\nits resources should be so\nmany times more brilliant\nthan the RCSU. But it\njust isn\u2019t. To return\nto the analogy\nof me screaming \u201cPLAYING\nFIELD\u201d at some\npoor medic \u2013\ncaught up in this\nfierce inter-faculty\nrivalry \u2013 I would\nlike to make a suggestion to the medics.\nDitch your sabbatical President and refuse\n(most of) College\u2019s mon-ey. At least that way, our\nplaying field would then\nbe levelled. If then you\nare still better than us, I\nmay consider accepting\ndefeat...\nT\nhankfully, as someone who will\nnow never run for an ICU posi-tion, I don\u2019t have to people please.\nBut I\u2019d like to think I\u2019m fair. So\nwhy am I here? I think that because Imperial has made it so.\nFrom Day 1, I\u2019ve been disliked for my sub-ject. As a fresher, many IC students walked\naway once they found out my career ambitions.\nBut not ICSM. That is where you are protect-ed. And therefore, why would any\nstudent ask advice from ICU\nwhen they can ask it from\nICSMSU? This advice, our\nclubs and societies, the\nexcellent welfare (kind-ly recognised) and endless meetings are my\ndaily routine. I haven\u2019t\norganised a single event.\nSo it probably isn\u2019t a fair\ncomparison.\nAnd as for my wages,\nyou\u2019re just jealous. To be\nhonest, the torrent\nof unnecessarily targeted\nabuse\nhas been written by a gentleman who moonlights as the \u2018System Administrator\u2019 for ICU.\nDoesn\u2019t sound half as cool as Medic President.\nIf \u201cI did nothing all day\u201d, the students and\nthe faculty would have cut the funding a long\ntime ago. In fact, the Presidential salary is the\nmost protected funding. So more importantly,\nwhy have RCSU not been offered the money\nto enhance their services to students and provide a full time RCSU officer? Because they\nare clearly not offering enough.\nI didn\u2019t know what RCSU stood for when I\ngot this job. I live and breathe medicine, the\nmedical school and every person in it. And\nbecause ICSM is such a fantastic place and\nMedicine a fascinating career, that is more than\nenough for me.\nI wish I knew more about RCSU to be able\nto tell you what we do better, but I don\u2019t. Nor\ndo I really want to; any list of events that a\nunion has offered that includes a Cake Sale has\na lot to answer for. Giving credit where due,\nICSMSU did get branded condoms following\nthe RCSU example. But we got more.\nThe sad thing is we need you as much as you\nneed us. Without scientists we don\u2019t have the\nmedicine to make people better. But without\nthe medics, who has skills to understand what\nwas wrong in the first place?\nSpeaking as the offspring of two mathematicians and a once student of Further Maths,\nI have nothing against scientists. In fact I\nvery nearly studied it in its purest form.\nBut the limiting factor was the lifestyle,\nand ultimately the purpose. At least when\nmy parents studied maths you could get a\njob with it.\nAccording to the Guardian\u2019s League Tables for 2012, 100% of Medical Students\nfrom Imperial College have a career after 6 months. Not that I expected to find\nanything less. Mathematics, for want of an\nRCSU example, has 77%.\nSo, as I get back to my Sunday afternoon\nof ICSMSU work, I ask can you blame us?\nScientists, which % would you prefer?\nICSM VS RCSU\nThe RCSU is challenging ICSMSU at the Tuesday Quiz Night on February 28 in FiveSixEight. Ahead of this, the Comment pages of\nFelix are taken over to see which is better.\nDisclaimer: If you read this as anything other than a bit of banterous free advertising for our joint event, then you read too hard.\nSU IS BETTER\nl Beaumont RCSU Vi\nun the inh\nay\nFelix a\nICSM IS BETTE\nSuzie Rayner ICSMSU Preside\nwritten by a gentleman who\nystem Administrator\u2019 f\nool as Medic P\nthe stu\n\n"

So it was\na risk adapting this sepulchral, haunting\ntale to the screen, where popcorn tends\nto distract from the terror.\nBut adapted it was. Central Television made a television production of The\nWoman In Black, which was broadcast\non Christmas Eve 1989 and repeated just\nonce since in 1994. This version was\nvery successful, and is often described\nas one of the most creepy, paralysingly\nscary screen adaptations of a ghost story\never made.\nSo, having worked wonders with this\nversion, why take the risk and make it\nagain? Well, aside from the fact that the\nrights to the version made by Central\nTelevision are M.I.A. (which is pretty\ncreepy), Daniel Radcliffe will certainly\nbring in a wide audience as the self-con-fessed ex-alkie graduates from Hogwarts\nAnyone who has seen Susan Hill\u2019s eery\ntale The Woman in Black on stage will\nknow that the performance is terrify-ing. Even people who say they don\u2019t get\nscared got scared in the theatre at this\none. But that\u2019s just it \u2013 in the theatre, it\u2019s\ndark\u2026the woman is creepy as hell\u2026oh\ngod, why is the rocking chair rocking\non its own\u2026oh my god why have the\nlights gone out\u2026.OH MY GOD THE\nWOMAN IN BLACK IS SCREAMING\nRIGHT BEHIND ME!!!!! I mean \u2013 you\nreally get into it when there are sev-and makes him associate more with the\ncreepy past of the mansion\u2019s stories. A\nnearby landowner (Hinds) tells Kipps\nabout a mysterious, cloaked old woman\nwho has been seen at the window of the\nold house from time to time. Even learning this, Kipps (foolishly) decides to\nspend the night at the old house to finish his paperwork, and learns a lot more\nabout the old woman, who pays him a\nvisit or two\u2026\nDirector Watkins is a true expert in creating a permeating sense of dread, and he\nkeeps you holding your breath with suspense for as long as possible before the\nshock actually makes you jump. Don\u2019t\nbe mistaken by the 12A certificate \u2013 true,\nthere\u2019s no blood or gore, hardly any monsters and ghosts in this film, but that\u2019s exactly what makes it so terrifying. Like all\nof the best ghost stories, The Woman In\nBlack only gets better in the retelling.\nDirector James Watkins\nScreenwriters Susan Hill (novel),\nJane Goldman (screenplay)\nCast Daniel Radcliffe, Ciar\u00e1n Hinds,\nJanet McTeer\nThe Woman in Black\nLucy Wiles\nHarry Potter and the Deadly Woman\nto something new.\nLet\u2019s be honest \u2013 when you heard\nabout this film you were pretty sure it\nwasn\u2019t going to be worth seeing. However, thanks to its well-styled, very Edwardian setting and some clever story\nchanges by screenwriter Jane Goldman,\nthis version actually feels less like a re-make, and more like you\u2019re rereading an\nold story with new eyes, realising things\nyou didn\u2019t get before, and the whole film\ntrembles with freshly scary resonances.\nRadcliffe actually gives a pretty convincing and mature performance as Arthur Kipps (extraordinary considering\nhe still looks like he\u2019s twelve years old,\nbless him), who is a lawyer summoned\nto a slightly dilapidated, remote mansion\nto settle the recently-deceased owner\u2019s\nestate. In one of the major twists from\nHill\u2019s original story, Kipps is a young\nwidower, which perhaps affects him, You\u2019re on your own this time...\nThe Human Centipede 2:\nFull Sequence\nIf you\u2019ve seen the first Human Centipede film, you\nmay well have been pretty disgusted. It wasn\u2019t nice,\nwas it? But this one is worse. This story follows Martin Lomax, a depraved maniac obsessed with the first\nfilm, and his insane urge to create a twelve-person\n\u2018centipede\u2019. You can imagine how it goes. This movie\nhas not been released into any UK viewing format:\nthe British Board of Film Classification deemed it \u201cundoubtedly tasteless and disgusting\u201d.\nIrreversible\nDirected by Gaspar No\u00e9, this French film was released in UK cinemas without much question, although admittedly with an 18 certificate. This is\nsurprisingly lenient considering a hugely graphic\nrape scene which goes on for what seems like many\nuncomfortable hours, not to mention some spectacularly extreme and gory death-by-fire-extinguisher-bludgeoning. Certainly not the best date film by any\nmeans.\nThe Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn\nPart 1\nVampires, werewolves, vampires having a minor disagreement with werewolves, a bit of running, a bit of\nslow motion vampire-y jumping, a girl pregnant with a\nvampire-human hybrid monster, said girl\u2019s pregnancy\ncraving being a nice cup of blood... yep, this is a spectacular film. Not only will the love interests (and I use\nthe term \u2018interests\u2019 lightly) bore the pants of all par-ties, but the strobe lighting and reasonably graphic\nbirth scene are likely to make some feel dizzy.\nLa Belle Noiseuse\nSeriously \u2013 any film in which we can see the fantastically gorgeous Emmanuelle B\u00e9art standing totally\nstarkers for two hours while modeling for a painting,\nshould not be a boring film. Unfortunately, the film is\nfour hours long... and the other two consist of close-ups of the painter at work. So not only are you parading naked lady in front of your date, you are also\nboring her rigid. I mean, at least have B\u00e9art do star-jumps, or something.\nHonourable mentions: Fatal Attraction, Titanic, Pink Flamingos, Precious: Based on the Novel \u201cPush\u201d by Sapphire, I Spit on your Grave, The Last House on the Left, Misery, Requiem for a Dream,\nRevolutionary Road, American Psycho, Showgirls, Striptease, xXx, The Fast and the Furious series, and any film by Lars von Trier\nWhether it\u2019s extreme violence, naked ladies, or weird psychos, there are films that are simply big no-nos\nFILM\nFELIX Friday 17 February 2012 23\nfilm.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFilm Editors: John Park\nLucy Wiles\n\n"

If you\u2019re me, the answer is\ntoo many to count. A lot of people\nout there have trouble keeping their\nsleeping pattern in check. It can be\nvery detrimental to your life (and\nreally annoying). It seems my body\nclock just wants to troll me con-stantly, smugly making me stumble\nbleary eyed out of bed after too little\nsleep. The recent freezing weather\ndoesn\u2019t help. It makes the warm confines of the covers look incredibly\nappealing.\nA new study led by Imperial scientists has found a link between diabetes and a person\u2019s body clock. To\nbe less cryptically vague, the study\nfound a link between the gene MTNR1B and type 2 diabetes. MTNR1B\ncodes for MT2, a receptor for the\nhormone melatonin. Melatonin regulates the sleeping cycle and also the\nrelease of insulin, which is what regulates the level of sugar in the blood.\nThe postulation is that mutations in\nthe MT2 gene could disrupt both the\nsleeping cycle and the release of in-sulin. Thus, people with the mutations will not be able to control their\nblood sugar level correctly. Therein\nlies the link between the MT2 gene\nand diabetes and explains the connection between two seemingly unconnected things. A person carrying\nthese mutations will not definitely\ndevelop type 2 diabetes, but the risk\nthat they do, compared to someone\nwithout said mutations, is increased.\nThe study looked at 7,632 Europeans and included 2,186 individuals with type 2 diabetes. In total, the\nMT2 gene can have forty mutations;\nall were tested to see what the effect would be. Four of these, which\nare, luckily, very rare, were found\nto completely stop the melatonin\nfrom binding to MT2. These highly\nincreased the risk of type 2 diabetes\ndeveloping.\nThe hope is that this discovery\nand mechanistic link can be used to\ngauge the diabetes risk of an individual and tailor medical treatments\nto their needs, a small step towards\npersonalised medicine.\nWikipedia\nA\nt the start of this month,\na statistical analysis\npublished in The Lancet claimed that deaths\ndue to malaria worldwide are almost twice as high as was\nthought \u2013 1.24 million in 2010 rather\nthan 655,000, as estimated by the World\nHealth Organisation (WHO). While\nthere is controversy over the study\u2019s\nmethodology, its implications for the\ninternational malaria eradication drive\nare troubling \u2013 the WHO also estimated\nthat 216 million people became ill with\nmalaria in 2010. Fortunately, these are\nnot the only large numbers associated\nwith the disease: annually, US$2 billion\nis contributed for malaria control mea-sures, and over US$600m for research\nand development to fight it. Progress\nis being made, and funnily enough, it\ntends to involve much smaller things.\nTwo recent advances have illustrated\nhow the tiniest things can make the\ngreatest difference.\nAround 50 antimalarial drugs are in\ndevelopment right now. The pace is\nhigh because researchers are trying to\nfind replacements for artemisinin, the\nprinciple malaria treatment worldwide,\nbefore it is rendered useless by spreading resistance. In January, an American group at Washington University\nin Missouri solved the structure of an\nenzyme, a protein which catalyses a re-action, that is needed by every parasitic\ncell to grow. It provides an example of\nhow exploiting the subtle differences\nbetween our cells and malaria parasites\nmay allow us to cure the disease.\nPlasmodium, the microbe that causes\nmalaria, is a protozoan and therefore\npart of a separate kingdom of life to\nanimals and plants. However, its biochemistry shares some peculiar features\nwith plants due to an ancient evolutionary event in which it took on an alga as\nan \u201cendosymbiont\u201d, a permanent resident of its cells, similarly to the way in\nwhich plant cells acquired their photosynthetic chloroplasts. The relic of this\nalga, known as the apicoplast, performs\ncertain chemical reactions for the parasite very unlike those done by our cells.\nCell membranes are made of molecules called phospholipids such as\nphosphatidylcholine, which the parasite\nmust synthesise to grow and divide. It\ndoes this in the apicoplast via a plant-like chemical pathway subtly different\nfrom our own, which includes a step\nthat never happens in our cells. The\nWashington group\u2019s protein is responsible for this reaction. The team has\nworked out its exact structure and is trying to explain its activity at the atomic\nlevel. If someone can use this information to develop a drug that blocks it,\nmalaria parasites could be killed with\nno harm to patients \u2013 the most difficult\nchallenge to overcome in development\nof new treatments.\nDrugs are essential to cure people infected with malaria, but eradication is a\nfantasy unless a vaccine to prevent infection is developed. A vaccine called\nRTS,S has shown promise, as reported\nin Felix on November 4 last year. However, RTS,S is not very effective compared to other vaccines and its protection may not last long. It will save the\nlives of many children under five, who\nsuffer over 80% of deaths from malaria,\nbut better vaccines will be needed to\nstop the disease spreading entirely.\nIn December, a team based at Oxford\nUniversity demonstrated a new vaccine\ntarget in rabbits. They exploited a weakness in the parasite\u2019s infective strategy\nrevealed only in November by a group\nat the Sanger Institute in Cambridge.\nMalaria parasites multiply by invading\nand parasitising red blood cells (RBCs),\nand until recently it was thought that\nthey used such numerous ways of gaining entry that no one method was used\nby every strain. The Sanger group tested several strains and discovered that\nevery one needed a particular RBC protein to get its foot in the door, a protein\ncalled basigin.\nBasigin\u2019s exact function remains un-known, and scientists originally recognised it only as the determinant of a\nrare blood group, Ok-, found in a handful of Japanese families. Nonetheless,\na parasite protein called PfRh5 binds\nto basigin and is somehow crucial for\ninvasion. The Oxford group produced\na vaccine by incorporating PfRh5 into\na virus and used it on rabbits, who developed immunity. The antibodies in\ntheir blood prevented all parasite strains\nfrom infecting blood cells.\nThis leap forward was unexpected.\nMalaria is a successful disease precisely\nbecause it works so hard to avoid being recognised by our adaptive immune\nsystem. PfEMP1 protein, the main protein to which we do become immune,\ncomes in 60 different versions so that\nthe parasite can repeatedly change between them before the body can eliminate it. People who live where malaria\nis common become infected many\ntimes during their lives, never developing full immunity, because Plasmodium\nis so adept at evading our defences.\nHowever, in rabbits, a vaccine granted immunity to PfRh5, of which there\nis only one copy. Why? PfRh5 seems to\nhave escaped natural selection for variation because the immune system does\nnot normally \u2018see\u2019 it. The reason why\nremains unknown, though it may be because it is only released by the parasite\nat the moment of invasion, straight into\nthe unlucky RBC. This is important because it may mean that all Plasmodium\nstrains rely wholly on PfRh5 to infect\nour blood. By \u2018showing\u2019 it to the immune system with a vaccination, protection far greater than that from RTS,S\ncould be achieved \u2013 perhaps enough to\nthwart malaria for good.\nA very high magnification micrograph of maternal malaria\nSleeping like a log...\n\n"

    "content": "NEWS\nFELIX\nFriday 17 FEBRUARY 2012\n6\nThinking of running? It could be you...\nAs nominations open, Matthew Colvin speaks to two of this year\u2019s Sabbatical Officers about their time in office\nW\nhat have you enjoyed most?\nI think it\u2019s working in the\nUnion and being part of a\nteam. It\u2019s a very good atmosphere to work in and it really\nhelps you do your role and also to see that you\nhelp other people do theirs as well \u2013 everyone\u2019s\ngot something to contribute and build on. Specifically within my role, I\u2019ve enjoyed getting stuck\ninto policy and operational matters, and making\ndecisions on how we run commercial services.\nI\u2019ve also really enjoyed seeing online finances really develop and be rolled out in a big way \u2013 obviously I\u2019m building on the work of my predecessors\nbut it\u2019s good to see that finally come to fruition.\nWhat have you enjoyed least?\nAt the beginning it was hard to manage my time.\nI found that the admin was taking up a lot of my\ntime and that was hard because it meant that I\ncouldn\u2019t focus on what I came into the role to do.\nAlso, I think it\u2019s fair to say that I didn\u2019t enjoy the\nbacklash from the Responsible Retailing Policy\nand the new bar nights procedure. I understand\nthe backlash, but it\u2019s never a nice thing to receive\ncriticism and it\u2019s quite stressful. I was able to respond to criticisms and of course I\u2019m glad for the\nexperience, but at the time it was very difficult.\nWhat has been your biggest challenge in the\nrole?\nThe biggest challenge has been trying to communicate to the student body that, while we are\nhere to represent them over their time at Imperial\nand their student experience, there has to be an\nimplicit acceptance that the Union is also a busi-ness. There are times when the Union does have\nto make money and that may not go down well\nwith some of the traditions of the clubs but we do\nneed to make sure that the Union sticks around for\nyears to come.\nHow far have you delivered on your manifesto\npoints?\nNot yet, but we\u2019re just over halfway through the\nyear. One of my manifesto points was about the\nSummer Ball so that\u2019s only just ramping up now.\nAnother of my points (which is a regular appearance on DPFS manifestos) was about cashless\npayments. We are looking into our suppliers of\npayment systems and we\u2019re also looking to work\nwith college to see if they are willing to help us\nwith that. However, because we need to look at\nall the options available to us it\u2019s not happening\nas quickly as I had thought. I\u2019m confident that\nsome move can be made, though. The other main\nmanifesto points included an improvement in the\nstandard of bar service; things have improved\ngradually for the past few months but with the experience and knowledge of our new management\nthe standard will increase at a much regular rate.\nI\u2019m also very satisfied with the progress of online\nfinances.\nIs there such a thing as an average day?\nThere is such a thing, as a lot of my time is taken\nup by admin! There are also various little tasks\n\u2013 almost housekeeping \u2013 such as responding to\nqueries on financial matters. When that\u2019s all done\nI take the chance to look at how we provide functions and dinners at the Union, at what we\u2019re doing for the Summer Ball, at new ways of clubs\nsaving money or how better to streamline our online financial systems.\nWhat have you gained from being DPFS?\nI have learned about how to manage my time,\nhow to prioritise my tasks and how to generally be\nmore effective. I\u2019ve also learned to do what will\nhave the most impact and to accept that there are\nsome smaller things that I can\u2019t resolve as quickly\nas I would like \u2013 that\u2019s been difficult to do because\nevery club is important, every club has its own\nproblems and similarly different parts of commercial services have their own problems, but there\nare some bigger issues that need to take priority\nat the expense of others. Further, I think I\u2019ve also\nlearnt the importance of not just making decisions\nbut also communicating them effectively and in\ngood time, and the rationale behind them.\nWhat advice would you give to those considering running for DPFS?\nIf you\u2019re concerned that you don\u2019t have the ex-perience, then that\u2019s a non-issue, we have very\ngood training. We can bring you up to speed\nvery quickly and there is an extensive handover\nperiod so you can learn the ropes very quickly. I\nwould also say that if you are passionate about finance and commercial services, and you see a lot\nof things that you have ideas to change and you\nthink could be much better, then you\u2019ll always\nhave something to contribute. There will be a staff\nteam around you who have got the experience to\nhelp you implement your ideas and you certainly\nwon\u2019t be isolated. You\u2019ll find it quite a satisfying\nexperience to try and make a difference in the way\nfinance and services are run.\nW\nhat have you enjoyed most?\nFreshers\u2019 Fair! It was a lot of\nwork and was very stressful,\nbut it was definitely the most\nrewarding experience of the\nyear so far; it was such a huge event and it\u2019s something that you know you have to get right because\nit\u2019s going to be the new students\u2019 first experience\nof Student Activities. The reason it\u2019s so rewarding and why I enjoyed it so much was because you\nhave to rely on the fact that volunteers are going be\nthere \u2013 that\u2019s not just the club members, but also\nthe Management Groups who come there on the\nday at 7 in the morning to help you set everything\nup. It\u2019s stressful because you know you are relying\non people who aren\u2019t necessarily paid to do the job\nthey\u2019re doing, but one of the things that makes it\nso great is that everyone pulls together to make it a\nfantastic event on the day!\nWhat have you enjoyed least?\nThe times when people come to you with something that they\u2019ve left right until the last minute:\nmaybe it\u2019s an event that they\u2019re having that evening or in a week and they\u2019ve not sorted something\nout. You just have to be prepared to drop everything to help them with their problem, because\nalthough you could try and tell them afterwards\n\u201cnext time, don\u2019t leave it so late,\u201d at this point they\nwant to have the event. You do get the satisfaction\nin knowing that, afterwards, they are grateful for\nyour help.\nWhat has been your biggest challenge in the\nrole?\nLearning how to manage your time. As I\u2019ve said,\npeople come in at the last minute with things that\nneed doing but at the same time you get a lot of\nenquiries from people, a lot of clubs that ask you\nfor help, and you also want to achieve the bigger\ngoals that you set for yourself that year. Learning\nhow to manage all of those and learning how to fit\nthem all into your day can sometimes mean working very long days, or it can sometimes mean being\nprepared to shift everything in your calendar at the\ndrop of a hat.\nHow far have you delivered on your manifesto\npoints?\nI\u2019d say I\u2019m just over halfway through. Some of\nthem are a lot more long term than Freshers\u2019 Fair,\nparticularly looking at storage. Ultimately, you\ncome into this job thinking you\u2019re going to achieve\neverything on your manifesto, but once you start\nand you realise the scale of some of the things that\nyou\u2019ve got to do, and also as other things keep getting added onto your project list, it becomes a little\nbit harder to achieve them all in the time frame\nyou imagined.\nIs there such a thing as an average day?\nWhile there is some answering of emails and club\nquestions, you could also be mediating between\nclub committees. You could have a meeting with\ncollege, talking, for example, about Sport Imperial\nor Arts Imperial or about trying to get some more\nmoney from the IC Trust for Tour Funding. On the\nother hand, you could have meetings with externals like BUCS or National Governing Bodies \u2013 so\nthere\u2019s never really a typical day.\nWhat have you gained from being DPCS?\nDefinitely being calm under pressure \u2013 there\u2019s a\nlot going on, and you have to be able to juggle all\nof that. I\u2019ve really enjoyed all the different things\nthat you get to do in one year that you probably\nwouldn\u2019t get to do in any other job. I\u2019ve sat on\nrecruiting interview panels, which have been really great fun but on a personal level the thing I\u2019ve\ngained the most is that the people you work with\nbecome your friends. In particular this includes the\nManagement Groups and Club Chairs who come\nand see you and who work with you on an almost\nday-to-day basis. It\u2019s incredible the amount of time\nthey put in and they do become really good friends.\nWhat advice would you give to those considering running for DPCS?\nThe first thing to say is that you don\u2019t have to have\nbeen the chair of a club or been involved in the\nUnion before. Even if you were the chair of one\nclub, there are 300 at Imperial and the variety of\nstuff that we do is huge \u2013 there\u2019s no way you\u2019d\nknow all the answers to the questions anyway. You\ndon\u2019t have to have any prior experience, but what\ndo you have to have is a passion for Student Activities. You have to have lot of energy to dedicate\nto the role, because sometimes you\u2019ll be working\nlong hours and sometimes you\u2019ll have to do things\nthat aren\u2019t really the most fun jobs in the world, but\nhopefully this year we\u2019ve managed to eliminate a\nlot of those. Actually, one of the things we\u2019ve been\nworking on is making the role less admin-based\nand more \u2018get out there and make actual changes\u2019.\nThe things you\u2019ll learn in handover will cover\nwhat you have to know and no-one knows all the\nanswers \u2013 even now in February I\u2019m still looking\nup the answers to questions!\nMonya Zard\nDeputy President\n(Clubs & Societies)\nMichael Foster\nDeputy President\n(Finance & Services)\nThe DPFS is responsible for the\nfinances of the Union; the bars,\nMetric, shops and Clubs & Societies all fall under his remit\nImperial has over 300 Clubs, Societies & Projects. The DPCS is in\ncharge of overseeing all of them \u2013\nfrom Freshers\u2019 Fair onwards\nnews.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nNews Editors: Sophia David\nAlex Nowbar\n\n"

Since I have met him he has shown a great desire to offer\ncheaper lessons to Imperial students and with the backing of other students\nI am more than happy to support him\u201d\n- Alex Kendall, IC Union President 2010-11\n5 Driving Lessons\nfor \u00a395\nNEWS\nFELIX Friday 17 february 2012 5\nNominations for the Union\u2019s \u2018Big Elections\u2019 opened on Monday 13 February\nwith students able to put themselves forward as candidates for departmental and\nsabbatical positions. The site\u2019s look and\nfeel has been radically changed from\nprevious elections, and the voting statistics have reportedly been revamped.\nThe decision to make the elections\ndifferent came from the central services\nmanager and marketing departments in\nthe union, who believe the change will\nincrease turnout even more. The new\nlogo and redesign was used to improve\nusability and rid the elections website\nof the previously used grey and green\ncolour scheme, bringing the site in line\nwith imperialcollegeunion.org and eAc-tivities. Union Systems Administrator\nand RCSU Vice President (Operations)\nPaul Beaumont worked with Jonathan\nKim, responsible for many web projects\nincluding FelixOnline, to produce the\nnew website\u2019s features.\nWhen the 2011 Sabbatical and Student Trustee elections opened, the site\ncrashed due to high demand, causing all\nother resources on the server to become\ntemporarily unavailable. This was due\nto the marketing and elections systems\nbeing on the same server which hosts\nclubs\u2019 and societies\u2019 webpages, Dougal. The union has four servers: Pinky,\nPerky, Dougal and Heeps, of which\nBeaumont is in charge of the latter two.\nSteps have been taken to ensure such\na crash does not happen this time, with\nthe voting website being moved to the\nPerky server in order to restrict access\nto union staff only and prevent high demand taking down other vital resources.\nThe Big Elections include faculty\nand departmental positions all under\none system. As a result, all positions\nare shown in one list and can be hard to\nnavigate. Beaumont told Felix that this\nwas due to \u201cthere being one overseeing\nreturning officer\u201d and that \u201cthings will\nchange once nominations close\u201d. It is a\nconstitutional requirement that the list of\nall positions is shown, and Union President Scott Heath\u2019s interpretation of the\nconstitution has resulted in the display\nof the number of seconders a candidate\nhas being capped at the maximum of 20.\nThe statistics website will go live\naround the weekend before voting\nopens, and a number of technical (as\nwell as aesthetic) improvements have\nbeen made. For instance, the stats will\nnow be pushed to clients from the server\nrather than the browser frequently pulling data, reducing load and the potential of crashing. When the nominations\nwebsite went live and the Union advertised that they were open, the site was\nstill not accepting logins to the elections\nsystem. Beaumont explained that \u201cthe\nserver was tested for a fortnight and its\ntime had gone out of sync by twenty\nminutes in that period\u201d, adding that \u201cit\u2019s\nfine now since the server is safe and secure in one of the College\u2019s datacenters,\nand the server has been set to autosync\ntime\u201d, assuring it will never go wrong\nagain.\nThe official Twitter hashtag for the\nelections is #voteicu, which started to\nreceive use around the same time as\nDeputy President (Education) Jason\nParmar tweeted that the hashtag of the\nweek should be #loveyourrep for Rep\nWeek. On the suggestion of a hashtag\nwar, Beaumont explained that he believes \u201cthe Union\u2019s tweeting as much\nfor the elections as it is for rep week,\nand the reps have had more of a physical presence across campus\u201d. He added\nthat the \u201celections will get physical in a\ncouple of weeks\u201d.\nThe electronic ballot box for voting\nhas also been improved, with candidates\u2019 manifestos and pictures being\ndisplayed on the voting screen, shuffled\nfor fairness. A brief explanation of the\nSingle Transferable Vote (STV) system\nis also provided, and the list of sec-onders (constitutionally made public)\nmay be used in the marketing website.\nBeaumont told Felix that he is \u201chappy\nwith how the system\u2019s been received\u201d\nand that he thinks \u201ceveryone\u2019s taken it\nwell\u201d.\nAlexander Karapetian\nNominations open for Union Big Elections\n\u201cElections will get\nphysical in a couple\nof weeks\u201d\nPhilip Kent\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX\nFriday 17 february 2012\n12\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nComment Editors: Tim Arbabzadah\nSam Horti\nCOMMENT\nFELIX\nO\nur front page story this\nweek uncovered a method students from the Department of Computing\nfound to be able to mass\nimpersonate final year students in the National Student Survey (NSS), effectively\nskewing the results in favour of Imperial.\nOf course, the aforementioned technique\nof programmatically scraping an internal\ndatabase for the names and CID numbers\nof final year students may be easy, but is\nrigging the NSS really that simple?\nLet\u2019s look at the information required\nto fill it in. We need the first letter of the\nstudent\u2019s first name, the first four letters\nof their last name, their CID number and\ntheir day and month of birth. Everything\nbut the latter is trivially found in the internal databases described, so a program\ncould theoretically automate scraping\nthis data and autofill the survey to pose\nas the students. The problem lies with\nthe date of birth, however. If the NSS\nrequired the student\u2019s year of birth too,\nit would be more complex to determine,\nbut not impossible. The TeachDB database from the Department of Computing\ngives us the year the student started their\ncourse, and we can make a few assumptions to determine their probable age, and\nas a result, their year of birth.\nOf course, this isn\u2019t perfect, and there\u2019s\na good chance we\u2019d lose more than half\nof the dataset of students to impersonate because of it, but that still means a\nfair number of students are still vulner-able. The crux in our method is that the\nNSS requires the day and month too,\nsomething that isn\u2019t available in (at least)\nthis database. One may trivialise the difficulty of obtaining this information at\nfirst, thinking it wouldn\u2019t be too hard to\ncross reference with Facebook, especially since students leave more information\nopen unwillingly to the Imperial net-work. I take issue with this suggestion. If\nyou take a look at facebook.com/events/\nbirthdays you\u2019ll notice it\u2019s actually quite\nchallenging to obtain birthday informa-tion.\nEven if one created a fake Facebook ac-count, added a few people from Imperial\nas friends until they had enough mutual\nfriends to confidently auto-add most Imperial people, they still wouldn\u2019t get full\naccess to as much birthday information\nas they\u2019d expect. The problems which\nmay arise here are that cross referencing the Imperial student database against\nFacebook will not match those who go\nby nicknames or have different names\nthan the ones they use with friends.\nAlthough the Facebook privacy settings work in the malicious person\u2019s fa-vour, it\u2019s likely this gives a lot of problems and increases the amount of effort\nrequired to execute a successful cross\nreference by an order of magnitude. People think they are being more private if\nthey do not show their age (and therefore\ntheir year of birth), but what they do not\nknow is that it is the day and month they\nneed to protect for the case of personally\nidentifiable information for use within\nthe NSS.\nAn additional barrier is the problem\nof scraping this data programmatically.\nOne used to be able to see a breakdown\nof friends\u2019 birthdays by month, but now\nwe get the data categorised as \u201cToday\u201d,\n\u201cTomorrow\u201d, \u201cLater This Week\u201d and so\non. By making it relative to the current\nday, Facebook\u2019s made it harder to scrape\nbirthday information, questioning how\neasy this last nugget really is to obtain.\nA further flaw in the NSS system was\nexposed in the article, showing that regardless of the amount of times a student fills in the survey, only their first\nresponse is counted and they are not\nwarned in certain cases that they have\nalready completed it. If this were the other way around, it would be much more\ndevastating. Should the NSS take your\nlast response only and we had a correct\nautomatic program to mass impersonate\nstudents, we could run the code on the\nvery last day (if not hour) of the survey,\noverwriting all previous responses. The\nfact that it\u2019s the first response, however,\nprovides a workaround by making use of\nthe phone call one receives upon forgetting to do the survey.\nOn rigging the NSS\nIf you\u2019ve not completed it and you\ndon\u2019t receive a phone call, it is possible\nyou have been impersonated. If a program can use a database to do it, don\u2019t\nhesitate to think your friends can\u2019t. Yes,\nI\u2019m looking at those of you who\u2019ve\nposted pictures of your ID cards online\non Facebook or Twitter, exposing your\nCID numbers on potentially the same\npage your date of birth resides. Don\u2019t\nhelp usher in an era of NSS trolling.\nSo even if we get around all this,\nthere\u2019s one more obstacle. Not everything in the survey is multiple choice,\nthere are some boxes which require text\ninput. Unless we define unique responses for each student, there\u2019s a fair chance\nthe NSS engine will detect patterns and\nbe alerted to suspicious activity. For a\nmalicious programmer with enough\nmotivation, it\u2019s not too infeasible, how-ever.\nI contacted the Deputy President\n(Education) Jason Parmar, who told me\nthat even so, it\u2019s \u201cwidely accepted as\nthe \u201ccurrent\u201d measure for student satisfaction\u201d, and that \u201cthis may change in\nthe next decade\u201d. Tom Wilshere, Computing Department Representative,\nbelieves \u201cthis discovery completely\nundermines the NSS as a reliable and\ntrustworthy source of information for\nranking satisfaction in universities\u201d,\nand that \u201cit seems ridiculous that students (or indeed universities) could\neasily spam the system to improve the\nresults for their departments\u201d.\nWith the commonplace nature of automated spam e-mailing systems with\nintelligent text generators that can pass\nthe Turing test and deceive humans into\nthinking they are human too, it\u2019s not\nfarfetched to wonder whether students\nat this university or elsewhere have\ntaken advantage of the exploits defined\nabove. If executed right, they\u2019d potentially go undetected and possibly get\naway scot-free\u2026\nNSS called\nyou up and\ntold you to do\nthe survey?\nVent at the\nannoyance by\ncommenting\nonline at:\nfelixonline.\nco.uk\nAlexander\nKarapetian\nNot sure if meme or caption. Oh, wait, caption. Oh well...\nIn last week\u2019s Felix, an article was\npublished in the Hangman section\nwhich many readers felt incited sexual\nviolence, trivialised rape and generally\ncontributed to the idea of a rape cul-ture. I would like to take the opportunity to assure readers that this was in\nno way our intention, and we all agree\nthat a piece of content which does this\nis wholly unacceptable.\nFollowing complaints addressed personally to me, or otherwise, I have taken the decision to end the Hangman\nsection for the foreseeable future. The\noffending article, quite simply, failed\nin its ill-judged attempt at humour and\ndid not warrant publication. We are\nnow taking the time to carefully consider how any section designed with\nthe sole intention of being humourous\ncan feature and simultaneously exist to\nthe same standard as the rest of this\npublication. The level of offence that\nHangman caused is not something that\nshould be admired or actively sought\nafter.\nThis incident has highlighted several\nmajor flaws in our quality control pro-cess, for which I take full responsibil-ity. As a result, I am taking concrete\nsteps to ensure that this does not happen again. Alongside the removal of the\nHangman section, any future section\nwith the intention of comedy or satire will be held to more stringent content guidelines and I will ensure that\nthe consequences of every article we\npublish are considered fully. I am also\nmaking certain that our writing team is\nfully educated on and sensitive to topics that could cause offence if handled\nimproperly.\nOf course, humour does have a place\nin Felix, but now is the time to take a\nserious step back from the events of\nlast week and refocus our attention\ninto something that actually deserves\na place in this publication. We need\nsomething that sits comfortably alongside such reasoned debate and content such as that I have had the privilege of editing, and not something that\npushes the boundaries of offence for\nthe sake of an article that barely provides a modicum of humour.\nI do deeply regret my own personal\nfailure in not having taken action to prevent this happening in the first place,\nand I would like to reassure readers\nthat after this incident the content that\ngoes into any section will be radically\nrethought before publication.\nA note on last week\u2019s\nHangman\n\n"

The\nfact that the series is entitled Quantum Gravity gives some hint that\nthere may be more to things than instantly meet the eye, and this is definitely the case.\nThough Lila Black is a massively\nenhanced superhuman spy, there are a\nnumber of departures from the sort of\nself-sufficient, badass feminist character whom you would expect here.\nLila comes with flaws aplenty, which\ninitially crop up as just this. Later the\ndetails of the accident that left her at\ndeath\u2019s door become more and more\nclear and what looks like an irrational\nhatred and fear of certain aspects of\nwhat proves to be a very interesting\nworld are actually completely justified\u2026 just in time for them to be\ncompletely transformed.\nI mention that the world is interest-ing, but what I should probably say\nis the \u2018worlds\u2019 plural are interesting.\nKeeping it Real is set in a hemorrhaging mash up of the realms of men,\nelves, demons, fey and elementals,\nall bleeding into one another to some\ndegree. In contrast to Robson\u2019s earlier works this is not, at least in the\nfirst book, particularly science heavy,\nand if you\u2019re the kind of person that\nneeds a logical explanation as to why\na supercollider would explode and\ncreate passages into magical realms\nthen perhaps this series isn\u2019t for you.\nOverall the science is reasonably\nbelievable if not always explicable and this leaves time free in the\nshort novel to flesh out what I (and\nI assume Ms Robson) think to be the\nmore important issues of Lila herself,\nas well as the colorful and disparate\nworlds that she walks the character\nthrough throughout the series. Perhaps more importantly for a science-fantasy fusion the magical system is\nconsistent, interesting and logical. It\ncontains interesting elements such as\nthe \u201cgames\u201d that are essentially magically enforced wagers that can have\nextreme consequences and are often\nentered into unknowingly by humans\nunable to play them out as confidently\nas the elves and other magically endowed beings from the other realms.\nBook One focuses primarily on the\nelves and the Elvish realm and culture\nthat Lila is unwillingly dragged into\ndespite a hatred and revulsion for this\nsecretive and different race \u2013 and the\nmagic that comes with them. In her\nundercover mission to protect perhaps the oddest elf in all the realms\n\u2013 Zal, lead singer of a rock band rising rapidly to superstardom despite\nthe fact that \u201celves don\u2019t rock\u201d \u2013 Lila\nhas to try to ascertain the validity of\ndeath threats that lead into a much\nbigger and more complex plot than\nshe or her superiors ever imagined.\nAdd to this the identity issues inherent in a 21 year old who\u2019s been rebuilt\nwith largely prosthetic, or in fact ro-botic, body parts, unable to return to\nher home or her family and friends. A\n21-year-old who has, of course, made\nthe mistake of getting into a romantic game with Zal along the way (this\nis perhaps a little predictable\u2026 but\nwho really cares so long as it\u2019s hot,\nright?).\nKeeping it Real has all the elements\nneeded for an enthralling read and\ndelivered in a humorous and effortless manner I\u2019d really recommend it.\n\u201ca hemorrhaging mash up of the\nrealms of men, elves,\ndemons, fey and el-ementals all bleeding\ninto one another\u201d\nThe series, now onto its fifth book,\nhas been extremely successful and I\nlook forwards to finding some time to\nconsume those that I haven\u2019t gotten\nround to.\nAlex Savell\nAnjuli O\u2019Connor is having a tough\ntime \u2013 her oldest friend has just died\nafter trying to upload his consciousness to the internet. She is being\nSilver Screen\nby Justina Robson\nEmpire in Black\nand Gold\nby Adrian Tchaikovsky\nDouble Vision\nby Tricia Sullivan\nforced by her company to testify at\na court case that will determine the\nlegal rights of artificial intelligences\nand various extremist groups would\nlike nothing better than to see her\ndead. Welcome to the world of Silver\nScreen \u2013 Justina Robson\u2019s cyberpunk\nmasterpiece.\nAt its core this book is a fascinating\njourney of discovery as both Anjuli\nand 901, the AI she works with, struggle to find their place in the world.\nThis naturally leads on to the compelling theme of what is consciousness\nas the book asks: how do we define a\nhuman being?\nIt\u2019s also refreshing that, instead of\nthe default cyberpunk setting of a\nsprawling megacity, much of the action in Silver Screen takes place in an\nEngland that is not to unrecognisable\nfrom the country today. It took a bit\nof getting used to high stakes intrigue\nplaying out in places like Manchester,\nan unusual setting for this kind of lit-erature, but it certainly added a sense\nof intimacy to the story, and a feeling\nthat the situations it described could\nreally happen.\nMaciej Matuszewski\nEmpire in Black and Gold is the first\nbook in Adrian Tchaikovsky\u2019s long\nrunning Shadows of the Apt series.\nThe series is set in an intriguing universe populated by a number of different humanoid races \u2013 each named af-ter, and sharing certain characteristic\n(such as wings) with, a specific insect\nor arachnid species. This is a world\nwere magic and relatively advanced\ntechnology, such as ornithopters and\nsteam power, coexist \u2013 an interesting idea that gives a very attractive,\nalmost steampunk-like, feel to the\nnovels.\nThis first book in the series deals\nwith the beginning of the war of\nconquest waged by the Wasp Empire\nagainst the Beetle city-states of the\nLowlands. The opening chapter grabs\nyou instantly with its vividly described battle scene. The book rarely\nlets up the pace afterwards as it follows the desperate attempts, spurred\non by his being present at the brutal\ncapture of the city of Myna seventeen\nyears previously, of Stenwold Maker\nto prepare his people for the deadly\nonslaught of the Wasp armies. In\nshort, a perfect book for anyone who\nlikes well written action and intrigue.\nMaciej Matuszewski\nDouble Vision follows Karen \u2018Cookie\u2019\nOrbach, a self proclaimed psychic,\nwho, whenever she looks at a television screen, sees visions of a war\nfought by humans and their machines\nagainst a truly alien extraterrestrial\nspecies on a distant planet. Employed\nby the Dataplex Corporation to record\nwhatever she sees, Cookie also has to\ndeal with her ordinary life as an in-secure, overweight person. However,\nnot all is as it seems with her visions,\nand soon she begins suspect that her\nemployers aren\u2019t telling her the whole\ntruth as to why they require her ser-vices.\nThe best word that could be used to\ndescribe this book is \u201cweird\u201d, but in\na good way. Little clues, and the use\nof the second person narration in the\nvision chapters, help to unnerve the\nreaders and gradually point them to\nthe surprising, but very satisfying,\nconclusion. Another big plus for this\nnovel are its likeable, well developed\ncharacters; especially Cookie herself \u2013 a massive science fiction fan\nwith whom the target audience will\nhave no trouble empathising with. If\nyou like the general feel of Philip K.\nDick\u2019s work but want something that\nis ultimately a bit more comprehen-sible, this is the book for you.\nMaciej Matuszewski\nPicocon 29 will be held\nat the Union on Saturday 18 February from\n10am.\nSee icsf.org.uk/picocon\nfor more information\n\n"

Off the back of a mediocre performance in deepest, darkest and dirtiest Portsmouth last Wednesday, we were completely\nready to spring back to winning ways.\nA completely new-look Medic side from\nthe one we played last term, along with several\nringers from their 1st XI intrigued us somewhat\nas the Medics 2nd XI have failed to win any of\ntheir games this season and languish at the bottom of our BUCS league.\nThe match started with a flourish. Some excellent passing littered the first portion of the\nfirst half, with the seemingly frequent distribution channel of B. Man Briggs, Boris, Meatspin, Soggy Biscuit, GTG and Strap-on completely ripping apart the Medic midfield. The\npreliminary symptoms of an impending defeat\nobviously didn\u2019t settle well with our Medic\nfriends and they fought back with a couple of\ncrafty attacks down both flanks. If it wasn\u2019t for\nthe heroics and diving tackles of B. Man Briggs\nat right back it may well have been first blood\nto the Medics.\nHalfway through the first half came the\nbreakthrough for IC. A scuffed undercut was\nplucked by a Medic midfielder above shoulder height and this led to the umpire giving a\nfree hit to us. While the Medics were protesting against the decision, the quick thinking of\nFresher Ed to self-pass and set up a breakaway\nattack paid dividends, with a lovely through-ball to Captain Slow who swept the ball into\nthe goal for IC.\nNeedless to say, the Medics were furious at\nwhat they saw as an unfair advantage gained\nafter the self pass. After a prolonged consultation between the umpires it was decided the\ngoal should stand, prompting one of the Medics to agriculturally hurl his stick in anger about\nthirty feet. Ironically, C. Bell decided to ask the\numpire to send him off which didn\u2019t happen.\nIt reached half time with the score at 1-0,\nand some choice words from B. Man Briggs\nsuch as \u201cno more beef\u201d were taken on board by\ncertain members of the team.\nOnce the second half got underway it became increasingly clear that the Medics\u2019 keeper and defenders were actually in a league of\ntheir own. There were possibly five or six opportunities where we could have scored from\nSPORT\nFELIX\nFriday 17 february 2012\n38\nWeb: www3.imperial.ac.uk/sports\nFacebook: Search \u2018Sport Imperial\u2019\nTwitter: @SportImperial\nsport.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nSport Editor: Indy Leclercq\nclose range, having either rounded the last defender or the goalkeeper, only to have our shot\nblocked by the last man\u2019s stick on the goal line.\nIt was clear that we were going to need more\nthan just hitting the ball in the general direction\nof the goal to succeed in securing the win in\nthis match.\nUnfortunately halfway through the second\nhalf the Medics prevailed in getting an equal-izer. A mixup in central midfield as to which\nplayers they were marking led to a 4 on 3 overload in our 22, leading the Medics to sail the\nball past Glory Hole\u2019s outstretched left hand\nfrom the top of the circle.\nThe rest of the game saw both sides push for\nthe win. Some last ditch defending by the stirling back four ensured that the Medics stayed\nout. Unfortunately our short corner routines\nwere once again woeful, something that should\nbe changed. The indecisiveness of the short\ncorner striker led to the Medics poaching the\nball from unnecessarily on multiple occasions,\nand this led to many of our chances simply\nsquandered.\nWith the final score 1-1, it was probably a\nfair result for both teams. However, with IC\nMens\u20192s having the only team to not have won\nor drawn their Varsity Match at least once in\nthe last two years, the hunger to conquer on the\n21st March is now stronger than ever.\nIC Men\u2019s 2s 1\nImperial Medics 2s 1\nAnother one bites the astroturf\nInterested in Sport?\nWant to contribute to Felix?\nHelp us to edit this\nsection!\nEmail sport.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nor drop by the Felix office\nin Beit West Basement\nNo prior experience necessary!\n\n"

    "content": "Vintage bar night for hockey club\nThe Imperial College Hockey Club\n(ICHC) hosted a bar night at Vintage,\nformerly Chateau 6, on Thursday last\nweek. The event was open to all students and served as a way for both\nstudents involved in sports and others\nto blow off some steam before the all-important Varsity games this March.\nThe event was organised by ICHC\nClub Captain Jason Ye and Social Secretaries Guy Khosla and Gilles Stassen,\nwith tickets costing \u00a35 and including a\nfree shot when bought online. Tickets\nwere also available on the door and\nthe venue filled up rapidly as the evening progressed. The organisers had\nsecured drinks deals with Vintage that\nkept their attendees\u2019 drinks flowing,\nwith beer and Jagerbombs at \u00a32, vodka\nmixers at \u00a33 and a surprise addition\nof Sex On The Beach cocktails at \u00a33\nfollowing the generosity of the venue\u2019s\nstaff hours before the event kicked off.\nTwo ICHC members, Joe Andrews\nand Josh Freemont, (Jolt DJs) provided\nthe music and served as the DJs for the\ndancefloor. Their exhilarating mashups\nfilled Vintage with avid students who\nbraved the snow to come out and experience an invigorating clubbing at-mosphere. Coupled with the fair drinks\nprices, the barrage of over 150 students\nhad an overall air of positivity about\nthe event.\nWe asked Jason Ye why he chose\nVintage for the venue rather than Metric or the Union, and he explained that\n\u201cby holding it at Vintage, [they] were\nnot exposed to any financial risk or\ncosts\u201d, what with there being no minimum bar spend, minimum attendance,\nstewarding costs and other limitations.\nWhile hosting a \u201cWe Are Metric\u201d night\nin the Union would require the event to\nend at 11pm, Vintage stayed open three\nhours later, and the ICHC were able\nto negotiate \u201cvery favourable drinks\ndeals\u201d because they supplied their own\nDJs.\n\u201cThe fact that it was an event open\nto everyone and not just the Hockey\nClub made it a great night\u201d, Jason con-tinued, adding that Vintage \u201cseemed\npretty receptive to holding more events\nin the future\u201d and that \u201cthe club is an\nextremely nice venue\u201d.\nThis was the first event of its kind for\nthis year\u2019s ICHC committee, and the\nweather conditions on the night raised\nconcern for turnout, but Jason told Felix they were \u201cextremely pleased with\nhow it went and would probably look to\nhold [an event] there again some point\nin the future\u201d. ICHC found it particularly interesting that \u201cthere were quite\na few people who bought their tickets\non the door, including members of the\npublic who were just looking to get out\nof the snow\u201d. This, in turn, worked in\ntheir favour, as \u201cthe mix of ICHC mem-bers, Imperial students and the public\ncontributed to an amazing atmosphere\ninside\u201d.\nVintage has previously been used by\nmany Imperial Clubs & Societies for\nvarious events as Chateau 6 before its\nrebranding. With an extensive range of\ncocktails, its prime location opposite\nFulham Broadway station and numerous rooms for gathering or dancing,\nthe ICHC executed a fun filled event\nfor all.\nQueen\u2019s Tower Rooms\n18.00 Thursday 15 March\nFIND A FLATMATE\nFREE MINGLE EVENT\n\u00bb .FFU\u0003QPUFOUJBM\u0003lBUNBUFT\n\u00bb 4BGF \u0003TPDJBM\u0003FOWJSPONFOU\u0003\n\u00bb '3&&\u0003QJ[[B\u0003BOE\u0003TPGU\u0003ESJOL\u00d0\n\u00bb $BTI\u0003CBS\u0003BWBJMBCMF\n\u00bb /P\u0003BXLXBSE\u0003lBUNBUF\u0003AJOUFSWJFXT\b\n&NBJM\u001b\u0003kOEBlBUNBUF!JNQFSJBM\u000fBD\u000fVL\u0003UP\u0003TJHO\u0003VQ\nSFHJTUFS\u0003CZ\u0003\u001a\u0003.BSDI\nwww.imperial.ac.uk/accommodation\nAlexander Karapetian\nAlexander Karapetian\nWhen they break out the pens, it\u2019s time to get out\nCLUBS & SOCIETIES\nFELIX Friday 17 february 2012 35\n\n"

    "content": "BOOKS\nFELIX Friday 17 February 2012 29\nJim has clearly had better days\nBetter read than Dead\nD\neath is a real nuisance.\nYou can\u2019t move, you\ncan\u2019t see, you can\u2019t \u2013\nwell, let\u2019s be honest\nhere, you can\u2019t do much\nat all. The best you can manage is a bit\nof basic decomposition, but it\u2019s not really something to brag about (not that\nyou can talk anyway). On the plus side\nthough, you do get some well-deserved\nshuteye. That is, unless you\u2019re awakened by a rogue necromancer who runs\nmonthly entertainment nights for his\nundead minions.\nThis is Mogworld, the debut novel by\nBen \u201cYahtzee\u201d Croshaw, most famous\nfor his scathing online video game reviews and opinion pieces for The Escapist. Regular viewers will be able\nto pick up on his style of humour very\nquickly, though those unfamiliar with\nthe Australian-based British-born game\nreviewer may need to take a chapter or\ntwo to adjust.\nMogworld has been described as what\nTerry Pratchett would have written had\nhe been addicted to video games in his\nyouth. In his book Yahtzee takes the\nmagical fantasy genre and tips it on its\nhead, blending fantasy elements with\nhis knowledge and passion for gaming.\nNot to spoil too much, but the world the\ncharacters inhabit isn\u2019t quite all that it\nseems. Maybe you can work it out if I\ntell you that the \u201cMog\u201d of Mogworld\nis actually an acronym for something\nelse\u2026\nThe choice to write from a first person perspective was a wise decision.\nYahtzee is able to transpose both his\nthoughts and his feelings into the protagonist Jim, an undead low-level mage,\nresulting in a character that\u2019s more like\nVictor Meldrew than Frodo Baggins.\nJim is an unheroic and irritable character driven only by a strong desire to\nbe dead again, constantly irked by his\ncompanions; his mundane thoughts\nare at constant odds with the fantasti-cal world he is forced to inhabit and the\nreality shifts he has to face during the\nstory\u2019s progression.\nAnd yet he still remains a lovable\ncharacter. Despite his flaws you can\nsympathise with his plight, the only\nsane man in a world full of blood-crazed suicidal barbarians, corrupt\nguild officials and terminally depressed\ncitizens. He\u2019s the straight man, one\nyou can sympathise with despite his\nterminal undead status. He hasn\u2019t got\nsuperpowers, he\u2019s not special, and he\u2019s\nas flawed as the next man (or zombie,\nif you\u2019d prefer); yet by the end of the\nbook you find yourself rooting for him\nto succeed in his desire to finally \u201crequiescat in pace\u201d.\nJuxtaposing Jim is a range of colourful characters that serve to work up his\n(congealed) blood pressure, including\nSlippery John the inept thief and Barry\nthe Vicar. By the end of the story most\nof the supporting characters\u2019 paths have\nintertwined but at no point does it ever\nfeel forced \u2013 they interact with one another seamlessly, despite how utterly\nridiculous everything gets towards the\nclosing chapters.\nOne word of advice before picking up\nMogworld: if you can\u2019t tell me what an\nMMO is, or what WoW is all about, you\nmay want to think twice before reading.\nYahtzee has done an excellent job of\nbalancing general humour against video\ngame humour, but ultimately many of\nthe subtler jokes will be missed, and the\noverall story, whilst far from complex,\nwill be better appreciated by those readers who know how to tell their FPSs\napart from their RTSs.\nAll in all, Mogworld remains one of\nmy favourite books, funny and somewhat fresh despite some minor repetition of jokes I\u2019ve already heard from his\nonline review series. A fun, immersive\nread all round.\nA moving reminder of simpler times\nI know what you\u2019re thinking \u2013 surely this can\u2019t be a review of a series of children\u2019s stories in Felix.\nWell, if the television section can\nreview My Little Pony I can review\nthe Nicholas books. Indeed, while\nit can classified as children\u2019s lit-erature, I for one think that the main\nappeal of the series is for adults.\nLe Petit Nicolas, as the eponymous\nprotagonist and narrator of the stories is known in the original French,\nwas created in 50s by Ren\u00e9 Goscinny,\nbest known for his work on the Ast\u00e9rix comics. Goscinny wrote over two\nhundred short stories about the red\nsweatered seven year old \u2013- first in\nthe Belgian paper Le Moustique and\nlater in the highly respected Sud Ouest\nDimanche. It was not long before\nthese were collected in book form.\nNicholas is an ordinary boy living\nin an unspecified city in 50s France.\nEach story focuses on a specific episode in his life \u2013 from a school photograph to his parents buying him a\nbike. The humour is derived mainly\nfrom his understandably childlike\nfirst person narration. While\nyounger readers will certainly find Nicholas\u2019 ex-periences, and how he\ndescribes them, funny\nit is clear that the stories are also cleverly\ndesigned to evoke nostalgia in older audiences.\nNicholas\u2019 short attention\nspan, constant falling out with\nhis friends only to get back\ntogether as if nothing had\nhappened later the same day\nand his general immaturity\nserve to pleasantly remind\nus of our own childhood.\nAnother common element\nof the stories is commentary\non the absurdities of the adult\nworld from Nicholas\u2019 young\nviewpoint. Descriptions of the\nGames editor Laurence Pope reviews Yahtzee Croshaw\u2019s epic MMORPG parody\n\u201cMogworld has been\ndescribed as what\nTerry Pratchett would\nhave written had he\nbeen addicted to\nvideo games\u201d\nMaciej Matuszewski constant rivalry between\nthe Nicholas\u2019 father and\nhis neighbour, Mr Bl\u00e9durt, who are nevertheless described by the\nboy as \u201cfriends\u201d, the\noccasional petty quarrels between his parents,\nand his mother\u2019s empty\nthreats to move back with\nher mother, never fail to\nraise a smile. There is\na childlike innocence\nand charm to this all\nthat is very appealing.\nAny review of these\nbooks wouldn\u2019t be\ncomplete without a mention of the illustrations.\nThe name of the illustrator,\nJean-Jacques Semp\u00e9, quite\nrightly appears on the\n\u201cwhile it can classified as children\u2019s\nliterature, I for one\nthink that the main\nappeal of the series\nis for adults\u201d\nA look back at Le Petit Nicolas \u2013 Goscinny and Semp\u00e9\u2019s nostalgic masterpiece\nbooks\u2019 covers with equal prominence\nto that of Goscinny. His drawings are\na vital addition and complement the\nstories perfectly. They are simple, reminding you of childlike sketches, but\nfull of joy and youthful energy. I can\u2019t\nimagine how they could capture the\nfeel of Goscinny\u2019s writing any better.\nThe stories are very short \u2013 most\ncan be finished in under ten min-utes, so you can get through them\neven if you don\u2019t have a lot of free\ntime. Indeed, they\u2019re the perfect way\nto relax and remind yourself of your\nmore carefree days. It\u2019s a shame\nthat the Nicholas stories aren\u2019t as\npopular as they should be in England but you\u2019ll probably be able to\nfind them in any bookstore, such as\nthe excellent Daunt Books, that has\na good children\u2019s and foreign literature sections. Pleasant reading!\nJim has had better days\n\n"

    "content": "By the time I hit Kerala I was more than ready\nfor it: with Rajasthan\u2019s dusty forts a distant\nmemory I was ready to hit up something a\nlittle more tropical. That\u2019s the incredible thing\nabout Kerala: after a short and breezy (read:\nforty hour and mosquito-infested) coastal\ntrain down from the north, you find yourself\nin paradise. Of course, to the rational mind\nthat doesn\u2019t doubt the existence of continental\ndrift, this shouldn\u2019t really come as much of a\nshock.

Watch instead the divine,\nmajestic Greta Garbo\u2019s Queen Christina,\nin which she plays a Swedish queen, torn\nbetween her loyalty for her people and\nher love for a Spanish nobleman which\nis much criticised by her country. Garbo,\nthe talented Swedish beauty who was\nthe Queen of MGM (the film production\ncompany that \u201cowned\u201d her) in the 30s\nhad a string of films that were released\nand proved to be instant hits. Her piercing gaze, large and clear eyes, and thick\nbut comprehensible accent, make her\nthe perfect heroine in a tragic love story.\nClosing with one of the most unfogettable\nclose-ups of Garbo\u2019s strikingly beautiful\nface, Queen Christina is an emotional,\nheart-breaking love story.\nOther worthy nominees: Dark Victory, It\nHappened One Night, Gone with the Wind\nThe 1940s: Casablanca\nIt was an easy one to decide, this. With\nendlessly quotable dialogue from its\nmagnificently nostalgic script, along\nwith a high-profile Hollywood pairing between two actors that has subsquently\nbeen copied but never defeated, this\nstory of unfulfilled love, regret and sacrifice is simply irresistible. The sudden\nappearance of an old flame (Ingrid Bergman) is bad news for a local bar owner\n(Humphrey Bogart) living in Morocco,\naway from all the violence sweeping\nthrough Europe during the early years of\nthe Second World War. They both have\na chance to escape to America but his\nlove seems to have turned up with a\nnew man of her own. Ending with one\nof the bravest, most heart-wrenching\nscenes of all time without a hint of any\nover the top sugary sweetness, Casablanca is the one essential black and\nwhite film that must be watched even\nfor those who aren\u2019t so keen on old-fashioned style.\nOther worthy nominees: Now, Voyager,\nIt\u2019s a Wonderful Life, The Lady Eve, Gilda\nThe 1980s:\nOn Golden Pond\nNot all love stories need to be about\nyoung, immature, attractive couples\ndiscovering the ups and downs of com-mittment with many tragic events along\nthe way. What is more deeply touching\nis the bond shared for decades, which is\nwhat is shown On Golden Pond between\nNorman (Henry Fonda) and Ethel (Katha-rine Hepburn.) The film is as much about\ntheir long-lasting love as well as the uneasy relationship shared by Norman and\nhis daughter, played by Jane Fonda (no\nprizes for guessing how she\u2019s related to\nHenry Fonda). It\u2019s a calm and collected\nfilm of many similarly styled performanc-es, with a careful, close perception of a\ntypical family life. An absolute must for\nanyone looking to be blown away by the\nsuperb portrayal of everlasting affection\nand dedication, and even for the coldest\ncynics who always struggle to sit through\na number of corny romantic films.\nOther worthy nominees: Out of Africa,\nMoonstruck, When Harry Met Sally, Reds\nThe 1970s: Love Story\nLove stories and tragic, tear-jerking dramas don\u2019t come much thicker than this.\nThe famous \u201clove means never having to\nsay you\u2019re sorry\u201d line was coined here,\nas two awfully pretty star-crossed lovers\nRyan O\u2019Neal and Ali MacGraw are separated and put through hardship by their\ndifferences in wealth, class and eventually poor health. This may have more\nmanipulative emotional pit falls than\nany other film you may experience in the\nfuture, but it remains a firm favourite\namongst the most romance-loving audience members. Based on a phenomenally popular book, the film turned out\nto be a massive hit too, raking in over\na hundred million dollars back in the\n70s States alone, on a modest budget\nof $2.2m. The Oscar winning score also\nplays a huge part in creating a sombre,\nrich, melancholy atmosphere, another\nsomething to break your heart in the\nfilm\u2019s most tender moments.\nOther worthy nominees: Harold and\nMaude, Annie Hall, The Way We Were,\nComing Home\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX\nFriday 17 february 2012\n14\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nComment Editors: Tim Arbabzadah\nSam Horti\nCOMMENT\nI\nnequality irritates me, particularly as it is so prevalent within our\nsociety. Women are oppressed\non many different levels; here\nat Imperial the most recent evidence for this is the refusal by the NCC\n(New Clubs Committee) of a Gender\nEquality Society. The reasoning of the\nUnion is as follows: we don\u2019t need\nanother women\u2019s society as we have\nWSET and a Gender Equality Officer.\nOur attempts to set up this society were\ninstead relegated to \u2018campaign\u2019 status\nwithin the Union, which, although no\none seems to know what this is, seems\nfair enough on the face of it all. The\nproblem is that this comes at a time\nwhen Felix is in trouble with the Telegraph for joking about Rohypnol and\nothers have pointed out how anti-fem-inist the only Women\u2019s society at Imperial is (see last week\u2019s Felix). There\nseems to be no time like the present for\na feminist or women\u2019s rights group at\nthe Union. Pity those in power disagree.\nWSET\u2019s goals, as outlined on its\nwebsite, are: \u201cPromoting SET careers\namongst women in College\u201d and \u201cEnhancing the flow of girls in SET departments at University\u201d. We aimed to set\nup a group to tackle more traditional\nfeminist issues, such as the prevalence\nof rape in today\u2019s society, domestic\nabuse, or the objectification of women in\nthe media. Upon speaking to the WSET\ncommittee they admitted they are not\nkeen for extra groups underneath them,\nas this would further divide their hard-This week\u2019s potential scandal\nEvidence for sexism in the Union?\nearned corporate sponsorship. However,\nthis means that the NCC\u2019s suggestion\nthat we form a subgroup under WSET\nwould be a little difficult as we have different aims; they don\u2019t want us, and we\nwant autonomy.\nWhen we mentioned that we would\nwant to run campaigns to tackle the\nwidespread sexual violence women experience in our society, the NCC were\nquick to ask what we would be doing\nto stop male rape or support male rape\nvictims. There\u2019s a meme for this line\nof questioning in feminist circles; it\u2019s\ncalled \u2018what about teh menz?\u2019 Now, this\nmight seem a bit dismissive as, after\nall, men do get raped too and it is every bit as awful as when a woman gets\nraped. However, until 50, 000 men get\nraped every year in the UK and until\n1 in 3 men can expect to get raped in\ntheir lifetimes (admittedly impossible to\nget truly accurate figures as up to 90%\nof rapes remain unreported), it isn\u2019t an\nissue of gender equality. Rape is a gendered issue because the overwhelming\nmajority of perpetrators are men and the\noverwhelming majority of victims are\nwomen, suggesting that our society has\na problem with violence against women.\nAsking that men take the lion\u2019s share of\nresponsibility for this issue isn\u2019t suggesting men can never be raped or that\nwomen can never be rapists; the same\nway that asking white people to take the\nlion\u2019s share of responsibility for institutional racism isn\u2019t saying white people\ncan never be discriminated against or\nD\neep breaths everyone.\nLet\u2019s open with the statement that no-one finds\nrape funny. So let\u2019s do\nthat: it\u2019s not funny. Noone likes to see or hear about anyone\nbeing abused in such a way. I\u2019m not\nparticularly interested if you think male\nrape is under-represented, or if rape law\nonly protects women, or anything like\nthat. This is not Reddit. Rape isn\u2019t ha-ha funny, plain and simple. I\u2019ve never\nseen an episode of Friends about someone getting jovially drugged, abused and\ndumped somewhere.\nSimilarly, I\u2019m not one for making comedy sacred. Free speech is excellent, with\nthe exception of television about video-games, and if you want to loudly announce to everyone on the 93 from Wimbledon how much of a bigoted twunt you\nare by telling an offensive joke to your\nfriend then by all means please go ahead.\nBut once we get above the nattering-in-a-pub level of joke-telling I feel we have\nsome baselines set down, and at an institution that is so fundamentally racked by\nissues of gender divide, Hangman probably stumbled too far last week.\nIt\u2019s gone downhill. While the Telegraph article that announced this story to\nthe world was about as well-constructed\nas the drunken, rambling tweets that\ncited it (one proclaimed \u201cRape is hilari-ous, right? Imperial College thinks so!\u201d)\nit was hard to summon the effort to laugh\nat the article. Hangman could hardly be\ndefended.\nSo in the week between me writing\nthis and it being published (editors will-ing) there\u2019ll be various things happening\n\u2013 lots of people will have Opinions and\nViews and these may or may not involve\nthe phrase \u2018PC-crazy\u2019 in a context other\nthan a Starcraft convention. Let\u2019s be\nclear, though \u2013 before we start having a\ndebate on the topic of women, men and\nImperial \u2013 that we exist in a man\u2019s world,\nstill. There are pockets of exemplary be-haviour, and the department I\u2019m in, in\nparticular, has some great people who do\neverything they can to combat inequality and bad examples being set. But let\u2019s\nnot pretend, as many commenters online\ntried to, that men are in any way hard\ndone by.\nAt the same time, jumping to the conclusion that we need an armed feminist\nsociety ready to kick ass, chew gum\nand live their lives in an independent,\nthoughtful and personally satisfying way\nseems like a knee jerk in the opposite di-rection. We shouldn\u2019t need to do this. We\nshouldn\u2019t need to get to the point where\nwe have to have a fucking Union society\nto remind people that women are a group\nthat needs representation. It is, to me, utterly unacceptable that Imperial would\nneed to drop to this level.\nOn Twitter, from time to time, Mrs.\nGeek\u2019s name pops up in relation to various things. She is a student at Imperial\nlike myself, and through her eyes I occasionally get glimpses of how bizarre our\ncommunity is. Oftentimes it feels like\nthat people of other races can\u2019t be rac-ist; it\u2019s simply saying that the two sides\naren\u2019t equal. The NCC asking what a\nfeminist group will do for male equality\nis every bit as ridiculous and bigoted as,\nsay, asking what an LGBT group will do\nfor the well known problem of heterosexual discrimination.\nConsidering we go to a university\nthat\u2019s 70% male and has 3 separate all-male drinking societies, is asking for a\nseparate, independent women\u2019s group\nreally that unreasonable? After all, there\nare a whole host of issues that female\nstudents are subject to, even when they\ndon\u2019t attend such a male-dominated\nuniversity: a recent survey by the NUS\nfound that 1 in 7 female students are\nvictims of \u201cserious sexual assault or violence\u201d while at university; eating disorders are at their highest ever prevalence\nin our age group, and women are chronically underrepresented in student unions\n(with only 22% of university presidents\nbeing female). What is Imperial actually doing to ensure the welfare of female students? And, more importantly,\nwhy was a society that aimed to allow\nstudents to discuss these issues and campaign on behalf of our female students\ndeemed to lack \u2018substance\u2019and rejected?\nThe clubs that successfully passed\nour NCC were a new App development society and a Harry Potter society\n(Pottersoc). Although we would like to\npoint out we have nothing against apps\nor Harry Potter in principle, it is a little\ninsulting that the NCC views either of\nThe iconic photo of Emily Davidson\nEmily Davison did\nnot throw herself\nunder the King\u2019s\nhorse for the right\nto play Angry Birds\n\u201d\ne right\ne right\nry Birds\ny Birds\n\u201c\nEmily D\nEmily D\nnot thro\nnot thro\nthese things more important than the\nquest for women\u2019s rights. After all, Emily Davison did not throw herself under\nthe King\u2019s horse for the right to play Angry Birds.\nAdding final insult to injury, the Clubs\nand Societies Officer seemed to suggest\nthat somehow our petition of 20 names\n(the requirement to start a new society\nat Imperial) was invalid as 6 signatures\nwere from people who worked at the\nUnion. This was because both of the authors work at the union and took our petition into work, which people were keen\nto sign. However the Deputy President\n(Clubs & Societies) claimed these people \u201cdid not care\u201d; last time we checked\nit was not a requirement to be a misogynist to work at the Union but apparently\nit helps according to the NCC.\nthere are only two ways to pass through\nImperial as a woman \u2013 either you get by\nbeing what Imperial\u2019s male contingent\nexpect you to be, or you shut yourself off\nfrom that world entirely and only communicate with other female students.\nNeither outcome seems favourable, and\nall the shouting and commenting I\u2019ve\nseen since the article went live seems to\nonly push towards these two outcomes.\n(Incidentally, Mrs. Geek appears to\nhave gotten through by doing neither of\nthese things, one of many attributes I find\nadmirable and worthy of great respect.\nYes, this is your Valentine\u2019s Day present.\nYes it does count. Love you.)\nSo let\u2019s bear something in mind, as we\nscrabble for what can be done at Imperial\n\u2013 we\u2019re trying to build a community in\nwhich everyone is happy, treated equally,\nand in which jokes can be made if they\nare appropriate. Don\u2019t be heavy-handed\nin our search for a solution, and don\u2019t let\npersonal prejudice against a minority affect how we treat the majority.\nAngry Geek\n... we\u2019re trying to\nbuild a community\nin which everyone\nis... treated equally\n\u201c\n... we\u2019re\n... we\u2019re\nbuild a\nbuild a\nMarissa Lewis\nKelly Osborne\n\n"

You\nwill see that they\u2019re pretty easy to cook and\nenjoy.\nLobsters are very expensive though, and\nthat is not only because they are very popular,\nbut because it\u2019s very difficult to find them.\nThey live in holes and caves in deep waters\nand don\u2019t get out of them very often.\nThere are two kinds of lobsters; the first one\nlives in warm waters and has no callipers and\nthe second one lives in cold waters and has\ntwo enormous ones. Keep in mind that a lobster should be alive to have a good taste when\nyou will cook it, as the lobster\u2019s meat quality\nis altered very, very quickly. If you feel guilty\nboiling them alive (although some people believe that the nervous system of a lobster is\ntoo simple for it to feel any pain at all), put\nthem in the freezer for 20 minutes to let them\nbecome numb and then boil them.\nFemale lobsters are more tasty than male\nones and here is the way to distinguish between the two; if you compare a male and\na female lobster of approximately the same\nsize, the female one has a wider tail to allow\nsome space for its eggs.\nIn order to boil your lobster, you will need\nsalty water, enough to cover the lobster com-pletely. Grasp the live lobster behind the\nclaws and drop it head-first into the boiling\nwater. Boil the lobster for 10 minutes for the\nfirst lb of weight and then three more minutes\nfor each extra pound. Once cooked, drain the\nlobster immediately and serve hot.\nYou shouldn\u2019t serve the lobster as it is, try\nto make your guests\u2019 lives easier. You can either use lobster crackers to crack the shell in\norder to reach the meat or cut the claws and\nthe lobster in half with a sturdy knife.\nWhichever your choice, make sure you enjoy it with the right person!\nThe Imperial Food Awards\nare back again for the\nSpring Term.\nThis time we\u2019re going\nFairtrade in association with ICU\nFairtrade Society.\nWe can\u2019t wait to receive your\nrecipes at food.felix@imperial.\nac.uk.

The committee then decides whether to accept or\nreject the application. However, often\nthe Committee must make decisions\nleading to the acceptance of clubs\nwhich subsequently become unsuc-cessful, or the rejection of proposed\nclubs whose applicants are told to reapply once certain issues have been\naddressed.\nIf implemented, the proposals\nwould not change the submission process but allow the committee a third\nchoice rather than accepting or rejecting the application immediately. If\nthey feel the club is viable but would\nbenefit from a test run, they could decide to put it into the New Club Incubator (NCI). The NCI would provide\nthe prospective club with facilities to\nbook a room for a test event, put up\nposters using the Union logo, create\na Facebook group using the Union\u2019s\nname and provide direct support from\nthe Deputy President (Clubs & Societies) and relevant Union Staff to run\nthe test event.

    "content": "CLUBS & SOCIETIES\nFELIX\nFriday 17 february 2012\n34\nfelix@imperial.ac.uk\nSpirit of Adventure with Mick Fowler\nEver sat in the Library, staring out of the\nwindow and wondering what else you\ncould be doing? On the last day in January, Exploration Society helped fuel the\nimagination of adventure by hosting a\ntalk by Mick Fowler.\nMick Fowler is a British mountaineer\nbut not your ordinary mountaineer. He,\nas voted in a poll by the Observer, is\n\u201cthe Mountaineer\u2019s Mountaineer\u201d and\nhas been described by Sir Chris Bonington as \u201cone of the greatest mountaineers\u201d. What does this mean? Well,\nhe\u2019s not just another climber who talks\nabout nothing but climbing routes and\nmakes a conversation about Physics\nseem more interesting. He is someone\nwho takes adventure to new heights and\ninspires you to try something other than\nthe latest console game during your free\ntime.\nI arrived at the talk to find a near-full Physics Lecture Theatre (LT1) and\nMick standing at the front waiting to\nstart. Mick began by informing the audience that he works for HM Revenue\nand Customs and enjoys exploratory\nclimbing in his spare time. If you think\nwe have already climbed all there is to\nclimb, you couldn\u2019t be more wrong.\nYou just need to look around and see\nwhat is interesting.\nDuring the talk, Mick relayed many\nstories of previous climbs and the experiences that surrounded them. In the\n70s, when flares were in, Mick and two\nclimbing partners pioneered the ascent\nof the White Cliffs of Dover by using\nice climbing gear. This adventure was\nmet by a small audience upon completion and was reported in the local media.\nMy favourite tale involved Mick ascending the finest ice climb in London.\nYou wouldn\u2019t think London was great\nfor its ice features, but on this occasion\nthere was a 65 ft ice stack on the outside\nof St Pancras station. While \u201cbelayed\nto a handy parking meter\u201d he ascended\nto find the ice stack had formed from a\nleaking toilet outflow. This landed Mick\nsome attention by the media and police\nservice. The ice flow was then axed by\nthe fire service to prevent Mick damaging the building. Ironically, the fire\nservice caused more damage than Mick\nhad when climbing it.\nApart from the unusual, Mick has also\nobtained many first ascents of Himalayan Mountains. His last ascent was the\nKajaqiao in China with Chris Watts. His\nprevious ascent, of Siguniang in China\nwith Paul Ramsden, won Mick the prestigious Piolet d\u2019Or (France) and Golden\nPiton (USA) awards for his route. To\ndate, Mick has achieved the first ascents\nof five conventional rock climbs, five\nsea cliffs, nine sea stacks, six ice climbs\nand eleven mountains. If you want to\nknow more about Mick\u2019s adventures, he\nhas published four books.\nSince 2010 Mick is also the Alpine\nClub President and is always enthusiastically encouraging all young active\nalpinists to join it! The AC is a great\nsource of help and advice when planning your next (or first!) alpine ad-venture. (More information on www.\nalpine-club.org.uk.)\nMick comes across as a modest guy\nwho just likes an adventure. I\u2019d recommend his talk to anyone. So it turns out\nExploration Society invite \u201cthe Mountaineer\u2019s Mountaineer\u201d to Imperial College\nNathaniel Bottrell\n\u00a9 Ernst &Young 2012.

The capacity\nfor this will be 350 people. Menus and\nprices have yet to be confirmed. In order to make the dinner viable, there will\nbe a minimum attendance figure. If this\nfigure is not reached by a yet-to-be confirmed date, the dinner will be cancelled\nand refunds will be provided to those af-fected.\nThough entertainment is also yet to be\nconfirmed, it is expected that acts will be\nspread across the Queen\u2019s Lawn Stage\nand the Great Hall, with one headline\nact performing on each, accompanied by\nsupport from bands and DJs. Entertainment will run from 8pm until midnight\nand tickets will be priced between \u00a325\nand \u00a330 pending further budget analysis.\nSit-down formal dinner back on the menu for this year\u2019s event\nIt is currently planned for one cash bar\nto be located in each venue, but should\nthe number of tickets sold approach\n1,500, a cashless system will be consid-ered.\nThe fairground also makes a return,\nalongside fireworks and the after-party\n(priced between \u00a35 and \u00a37), which will\nbegin at 11pm in the Union building, finishing at 5am.\nIn the passed paper (calling for Council to agree to the general plan for the\nevent) Foster writes that the goal for\nthis year\u2019s event is to be \u201cfun and affordable\u201d. The preliminary budget has\nbeen approved by the Union\u2019s Executive\nCommittee and a \u201cSummer Ball Forum\u201d\nwill be organised to receive feedback\nfrom the student body.\nSpeaking at the Council meeting,\nFoster confirmed that this year\u2019s Ball\nwould see \u201ca return to the style of 2010\nand earlier\u201d while maintaining a \u201cvery\nconservative and low-risk budget\u201d.

    "content": "COMMENT\nFELIX Friday 17 february 2012 13\nCOMMENT\nFELIX\nD\near Sir \u2013 The word\n\u201cfeminism\u201d is meant to\nbe on opposite ends of\nthe spectrum with \u201csexism\u201d. Arguably it is the\nonly means to combating sexism, but\nI hear this word being misused on a\ndaily basis. If even the most forward-thinking students often disregard the\ntrue meaning of the word, how can it\nbe used to combat sexism effectively?\nIn order for this to happen, we must\nfirst ensure that we have a true understanding of what \u201cfeminism\u201d entails.\nModern feminism is nothing like the\nbra burning activism that took to the\nstreets in the 60s, and it is certainly not\nthat crap that Sarah Palin claims to sup-port. Modern feminism is much more\nintricate and subtle; it\u2019s not because\nwe have lost our spirit, it\u2019s because it\ncan be. This type of feminism is led by\nstrong women all over the world that\nare demonstrating with ease that their\ncontribution to our advancement is just\nas important as any of their male counterparts (and no, I do not mean just in a\nreproductive sense\u2026). Good examples\nof modern day feminists include the\nlikes of Natasha Walter, who fully embodies this new, passive form of activ-ism, and Facebook COO, Sheryl Sandberg, living proof that we are more than\ncapable of playing in the \u201cbig leagues\u201d\nwith all of the boys.\nThe article on sexism in last week\u2019s\nissue of Felix convincingly presented a\ngeneral critique of the lack of feminist\nefforts at Imperial, pointing out that we\nare doing more to promote sexism than\nto discourage it. The author condemned\nWomen in Science, Engineering, and\nTechnology (the only society on campus to carry out feminist activity) for\nthe promotional material used for a\nclub night. The material in fact aimed\nto challenge the stereotype of women\nin SET and to say that any woman can\nbe \u2018sexy\u2019 and be in SET, but was unfortunately (and quite understandably\u2026)\ninterpreted as \u2018objectifying women\u2019.\nThis can rather rightfully be taken for\na misguided approach to try and reap\nthe benefits of the constructed gender\ndifferences that we encounter daily\nin university life, but the bottom line\nis: how is marveling over a couple of\nbeautiful belly dancers any different to\nthe way the varsity rugby players flaunt\ntheir masculinity? Men do the same\nthing, auctioning off themselves, and\njust because it is WOMEN auctioning\noff WOMEN, it has caught your atten-Keep up: this is the new feminism\ntion and this is a problem in itself. It\u2019s a\nsocietal problem.\nThe author may well be correct in\ndeeming WSET\u2019s angle inappropriate\nconsidering their platform, but I also\nbelieve that we should not live in fear of\nthese stereotypes. Whether you believe\nthat gender is entirely a social construct\nor not, social conditioning has led us to\nthis current state of mind that unfortunately has resulted in a disproportional\npraising of a woman\u2019s achievements\nand a likewise higher than normal \u201cunderstanding\u201d of the lack thereof. Any\nsensible human being would agree that\nthis is unfair. So, the question remains:\nhow can we change this? Accountably,\nthere are multiple ways of going about\nthis, but which is the most effective?\nWhat we are trying to fight in WSET\nis the root cause of the problem: getting\nmore women into SET careers. In a way,\n\u201ctoying\u201d with the current disputes does\nlittle to add to or remove from the root\ncause because it is an attempt at changing people\u2019s mentality without any real\nexperience. It is a broadly accepted\nview in philosophy that we only learn\nand develop through tangible change in\nthe form of experience, and although\nthe author raises some excellent points,\nwhat he fails to do is provide tangible\nsolutions to the highlighted issues. Get\nangry? Is that really the answer?\nMost of the time, when sexist comments are made, they tend to be just\nto get a reaction out of the target audi-ence, and I think the majority of us are\nintuitive enough to judge whether each\ncase is malicious or not. Of course, in\nthe former, \u2018get angry\u2019 is certainly the\nway to go, but in that regard I\u2019d like\nto think that that is what the majority\nof us are doing anyway; and if it isn\u2019t,\nthen it\u2019s what we all should be doing.\nIn WSET we try to stick to the post-positivist approach to feminism: TOO\nMUCH CRITICISM, NOT ENOUGH\nSOLUTIONS.\nThere are so many types of femi-nisms: Marxists who are critical of the\nstatus quo, linking women\u2019s oppression to the exploitive nature of capital-ism, liberals who value individuality\nand privacy, egalitarians who believe\nin no differences between men and\nwomen, existentialists who celebrate\nour natural differences, and also different waves (first, second, third) etc. At\nWSET we fight to maintain the \u2018status\nquo\u2019 by getting women into science,\nempowering women within science,\nand encouraging diversity through a\nvariety of means that include providing visible role models for younger\nwomen: proven to be the most effective\nmethod to combat sexism. We believe\nthat fighting for specific causes is more\neffective because realistically, what is\nfighting for ALL feminist causes going\nto do? Fighting for a cause is always\nbetter when the aims and objectives are\nclearly stated, and not broad and un-achievable.\nAlthough in legal terms men and\nwomen are now equal, there are traces\nof old-fashioned sexism that are inevitable due to countless reasons includ-ing, but not exclusive to, the fact that\nit was as recent as 1965 that women in\nFrance required their husband\u2019s permission to work abroad. This roughly\ncoincides with the time that the parents of current 20-40 year olds began\nwork. The unfortunate outcome: a\ntrickle down effect and remnants of\nthat mentality haunting us till this day.\nI am not trying to say that the issues\nwe currently face will disappear along\nwith that generation; they may or they\nmay not. What I can say is that as we\nmove towards a society relying more\nand more heavily on mental strength\nand moral fiber, the biological differences become obsolete with regards to\nprogression. Yes, there is still sexism.\nYes, as a woman you will be looked at\nand treated slightly differently than as a\nman at Imperial (and let\u2019s be honest\u2026\ngenerally in the positive sense), but this\nshould no longer be something to fear.\nThe war is over, now it\u2019s time for us to\npick up the pieces and put them back\ntogether with a new vision in mind.\nWe need to focus on what we as individuals can do. Turning this back into\na conflict will not resolve the remains\nof the battle, and the recent proposal to\ninaugurate a feminist society at Imperial falls directly in the eye of the storm.\nAlthough sexual violence is a major\nissue that deserves all of our attentions\nand efforts at Imperial, perhaps a feminist society is not the most progressive\nway to tackle such issues, especially\nsince these issues are at the heart of\nour social responsibilities and should\nbe targeted by all regardless. Instating\nsuch a society may possibly be coun-ter-productive in terms of truly achieving common ground. Not that they\nwouldn\u2019t have just cause for their plat-form. They would have plenty of just\ncause, and we would be happy to support all of their motions as I am sure the\nmajority of you reading this would also\nagree, the debate is whether this would\nbe the best platform to do so? Such a\nsociety should have been instated many\nyears ago; which makes me question\nwhether doing so now would simply\nadd to the divide? For those who think\nthat such a platform would provide legitimate ground for progressive work\nthen please sign the petition at http://\nwww.ipetitions.com/petition/icwrs/\nand help make this happen.\nIn the words of Isabel Allende,\n\u201cThe time is right to make fundamental changes in our civilization, but for\nreal change we need feminine energy\nin the management of the world. We\nneed a critical number of women in\npositions of power and we need to nurture the feminine energy in men. I\u2019m\ntalking about men with young minds\nof course\u2026 old guys are hopeless, we\nhave to wait for them to die off!\u201d \u2013\ncouldn\u2019t have put it any better.\nIn WSET we try to\nstick to the post-positivist approach\nto feminism: TOO\nMUCH CRITICISM,\nNOT ENOUGH\nSOLUTIONS\n\u201c\nIn WSET\nIn WSE\nstick to\nstick to\n\u201d\nH\nH\nNatasha Walter, author of Living Dolls: The Return of Sexism\nVeronica Gouvea\nWe\u2019re always looking for people to get involved and join the discussion in Comment. How do I do this you say?\nExcellent question, well done for asking, you\u2019ll be Jeremy Paxman in no time.\nIt\u2019s simple, you just email comment.felix@imperial.ac.uk with an article, or even just an idea!\n\n"

How I know you well! Last\nterm, just as we were heading off for Christmas,\nI wrote in a throwaway comment, which I\u2019d now\nlike to dispose of properly, that the Black Keys\u2019\nlatest album El Camino is a \u2018dud\u2019. Well, it is time\nto make amends. Using all the powers of apology\nthat I acquired as Felix Editor last year, let me now\nsay, \u201cI was wrong\u201d.\nThis change-of-heart occurred on the road from\nAlexandra Palace last week. We all know how difficult it is to admit changes of musical taste \u2013\nGod, forbid I should ever start enjoying Lana Del\nRey \u2013 so do not view this Damascene conversion\nlightly. I was returning from the Black Keys gig\nat the aforementioned venue, through a blizzard\nof snow that sadly didn\u2019t stay until the morning,\nwhen I realised my coolness towards El Camino\nwas misplaced.\nMy first taste of the Black Keys came from the\nsuperb mash-up of their album Brother with Big\nBoi\u2019s debut, Sir Lucious Left Foot: The Son of\nChico Dusty. It has jazz, style, and an unquantifi-able something that gets you moving in your chair.\nWhen I finally listened to the original, Brother, I\nfound myself standing from my chair, leaping on\nthe table, and dancing like I imagine I would if my\nlife was a movie...\nI should say that all of this happened about a\nyear after everyone else had listened to Brother.\n\u201cHey man, have you heard this sweet-ass album?\u201d\n\u2013 \u201cYeah, Kadhim, like a year ago; why are we still\nfriends?\u201d But then, a new album appeared on the\nhorizon. I could love the Black Keys and get down\nand jive, at the same time as everyone else. Holy\nfucking hallelujah! The first single, \u2018Lonely Boy\u2019,\nseemed to live up to my dreams \u2013 a ragged chainsaw guitar riff and an impeccably cool music video.\nBut when the album came out, I felt let down. It\nwasn\u2019t the hell-raising party I had expected. There\nwas a change of tone; it was less bombastic and\nmore introspective. Instead of screaming, \u201cMY\nNEXT GIRL [bumb bumb bumb] WILL BE NOTHING\nLIKE MY EX-GIRL!\u201d here they were singing woefully,\n\u201cOperayyytor please, put me back on the line \u2026 \u2026\ntold my girl I\u2019d be back, Operayyytor please, this is\nwrecking my mind.\u201d\nIt was only when I saw them live that I began\nto appreciate El Camino\u2019s softer touch (and upset-tingly realised that much of its energy had been\nstripped out by my laptop\u2019s tinny speakers). Brother and El Camino felt much less in opposition and\nmore like a complementary yinw and yang.\nIf you feel the need to point out that @theblackkeys\nhave five other albums, then tweet, \u201cyou don\u2019t know\nshit!\u201d, @kadhimshubber. Otherwise, tweet @Imperi-alLibrary complaining about their Inceptrance.\nMusic Editors: \u00cd\u00f1igo Mart\u00ednez de Rituerto\nAlex Ramadan\nOsama Bin Laden was a big fan of ales from\nthe Isle of Wight... Moving swiftly along, the\ntheme this year is Wildlife, which is a guarantee\nthat someone will completely ignore the theme\nand \u2018dress up\u2019 in a full-body spandex suit. Nondouchebags, take note: your costume is key \u2013 get\nit right and you\u2019ll be a muthafuckin\u2019BAWWS.\nAlas, I\u2019ve used up all my space. Tickets are\n\u00a3179.95 [inc. booking fee], which considering\nthat most gigs cost between \u00a315-20 nowadays\nand you\u2019re going to see far more than 10 artists,\nis still pretty good. I\u2019ve got mine \u2013 student loan,\nthank you \u2013 don\u2019t forget yours.\nBollywood Tent \u2013 you\u2019ll see. But if I\u2019m honest,\nBestival is a bit... errr, middle-class. In fairness,\nthe music is a good few floors away from main-stream, but I\u2019m afraid there\u2019s no way I\u2019ll be able\nto argue that a festival with luxury teepees and,\nnew this year, \u201cwood-burning Scandinavian hot\ntubs and a sauna area\u201d is anything like the rough-and-tumble of Reading & Leeds festival; there\u2019s\nno ritual tent burning for one thing. I don\u2019t know\nabout you, but I can\u2019t help but look back at my\n17-year-old self at Reading and think that\u2019s not\nnecessarily a bad thing...\nOk, next reason to hate the Isle of Wight:\nD\nressing up: probably the reason I\nlove going to Bestival every year.\nIn 2010, a pair of twins I know\ndressed as colonial-era hunters\nand chased the other festival-goers who had so foolishly dressed as characters\nfrom The Fantastic Mr Fox. (Last year, well, a\npicture speaks a 1000 words [see right].) There\u2019s\nno greater pleasure than writing about a topic\nthat you enjoy, so I will do my best to add some\nIsle of Wight hate into the next 300 or so words,\njust to balance things out.\nLet\u2019s get started. In 2009, Duncan Thomson\nand Sammi Gardiner, residents of the Isle of\nWight, had a Star Wars-themed wedding. Worst\nstill, they had the wedding on the 4th of May so\nthey could say, \u201cMay the 4th be with you\u201d. On\nthe other hand: De La Soul, New Order, Justice, and pretty much the whole freakin\u2019 Brainfeeder crew are playing Bestival this year. On a\npersonal note, Gold Panda, whose Lucky Shiner\ntour I missed, and whose Lucky Shiner album is\nprobably the best electronic album since Alexander Bell patented the first electric loudspeaker,\nis on the roster. (I hope you\u2019ll excuse me a little,\n\u2018HOLY FREAKIN\u2019YEAAAAH\u2019).\nAsidefromthemusic,Bestivalalwaysimpresses with the amount of alternative activities there\nare. Last year I \u2018starred\u2019 as the hotel receptionist\nin Ghostbusters; the year before I ran across tubs\nof cornstarch goo (as I believe is the scientific\nterm for it). There\u2019s a fantastically eclectic mix\nof stuff to do when you\u2019re not skanking out in the\nSimply the Bestival?\nKadhim Shubber on the festival that rounds off the summer with a bang\nroom to see warm-up act Band of Skulls, one\nthing became glaringly apparent: the crowd,\ngenerally speaking, were pretty short. It turned\nout that the gig was a 14+ event, something I\u2019m\nnot sure even existed when I was a young \u2018un.\nThe depressing feeling that I was potentially almost a decade older than some of them was balanced by the fact that I was guaranteed a cracking view.\nBand of Skulls delivered a solid performance,\noccasionally coaxing the crowd into movement\nbeyond default head-nodding. Not being hugely\naware of Band of Skulls myself, their brand\nof ballsy rock was tight and produced several\nstand-out numbers.\nAs the clock approached half nine, Dan Auerbach and Patrick Carney a.k.a. The Black Keys\nled the band onto the stage, their unconventional\nsetup belying where the strengths of the band\nlay. Usually, the drummer is hidden away at the\nback; here, Patrick assumed his raised position,\ncentre stage behind his kit, Dan to the right with\nbassist Gus Seyffert and keyboardist John Wood\nbehind. The band delivered the kick of a donkey\nas they started with songs from 2010\u2019s album,\nBrothers. Unfortunately it took a while for the\ncrowd to respond and I began to worry that this\nyounger generation of rock fans had lost the art\nof \u2018losing your shit\u2019. Thankfully, all it took was\nthe rendition of an effort from The Black Keys\u2019\nSimon Hunter\nBlacks Keys rock a heart at the Ally Pally\nLike most people who spent the better half of\ntheir teenage years during the mid-noughties,\nmy music tastes were fairly rigidly constrained\nto the world of indie rock. My iTunes library\nwas full of guitar bands and the ideal school\nnight involved necking a few tins, getting on the\ntrain and sweating copious amounts in the poorly ventilated gig venues of Leeds. These days\nthere are maybe three guitar bands that I pay any\nreal attention to, with the rest of my attention\nfalling on the world of electronic and hip hop\nmusic. Thinking about it, I\u2019ve probably been to\ntwo gigs featuring bands playing \u2018actual instruments\u2019 in the past year. Perhaps this makes me\nless qualified to comment on this whole thing,\nperhaps it makes me more so, perhaps I couldn\u2019t\ngive a tuppeny fuck either way.\nRegardless, there I was last Saturday being\npresented with a ticket to see the current kings\nof blues rock \u2013 The Black Keys. It was a gig\nI\u2019d been meaning to get tickets to for ages, yet\nnever followed through. Luckily though, my\ngirlfriend decided to excel herself and mop up\nmy incompetence, purchasing a couple of tickets\nand surprising me.\nWe rocked up to Alexandra Palace and, winc-ing, I immediately sunk fifteen quid on a couple\nof drinks. As we made our way into the main\nmost recent album, El Camino, to whip the kids\nup into a fury. I would like to note at this point\nthat we hadn\u2019t just gatecrashed some underage\ngig, but as at most gigs there was an (in this case\nsignificant) age gradient away from the stage,\nand we\u2019d managed to get quite close to the front.\nThe next hour was crammed with driving\nblues-rock rhythms, interspersed with some of\nthe gentler efforts from El Camino and others\nfrom their earlier albums including decade-old\ndebut The Big Come Up. As they left the stage\nto play the \u2018How long can we keep the audience\nwaiting while we sip Champagne?\u2019 game, I was\nleft hoping that when they inevitably returned\nthe encore would just keep going. As it was,\ntheir following rendition of \u2018Everlasting Light\u2019\nleft me in awe as beams of white light exploded\nout from the enormous mirror ball suddenly suspended above the stage. They finished the gig\nwith a couple more songs as the words \u201cTHE\nBLACK KEYS\u201d lit up in incandescent bulbs\nabove the band\u2019s heads.\nTo say this was the most fun I\u2019d had at a rock\ngig for a long time wouldn\u2019t really mean much.\nTo say this was the most fun I\u2019ve had at any gig\nfor a long time might mean more. Either way it\nwas great to remember how much fun I used to\nhave in those grimy venues in Leeds and that\nI\u2019m not too old to get stuck into a \u2018pit\u2019 every\nonce in a while.\nMark England\nSimon Hunter\nOooh-errr!\nBestival\nWhere: Isle of Wight\nWhen: 6\u201310 September\nHow much?: \u00a3179.95 [inc.\nbooking fee]\nWho: New Order, the xx, Sigur\nR\u00f3s, Friendly Fires, Justice, Hot\nChip, Soulwax, De La Soul,\nTeebs, Azealia Banks, Four\nTet B2B Caribou, Gold Panda,\nBuraka Som Sistema, and more\nJames Mossahebi\n\n"

It\u2019s amazing\nhow everything about the\nfilms \u2013 from their genre to the charac-terisation \u2013 has evolved and changed\nover time. This gradual change in genre\nis interesting because it sort of parallels the general changes in society, not\nto mention in values. The original film,\nDr. No, as well as the first few, were definitely much slower paced. They built\nup much more gradually, and there was\nmuch less action. The plot didn\u2019t play\nout too quickly; I guess some may say\nit was too slow to move on the story,\nbut that\u2019s all a matter of taste. I would\npersonally say that the later Bond films\nhave evolved into being almost an action film. At times, they basically are\njust a big gunfight. The point I\u2019m terribly making is this: life is lived today\nat a much quicker pace, back when (the\nexcellent, well, in terms of playing the\npart, not in terms of some of his more\nabhorrent personal views) Sean Connery was 007, everyone was in less of\na rush \u2013 yes, I sound incredibly old...\nEach Bond film, in many way, reflects\nthe era it was made in. It even fell into\nthe trap of the Blaxploitation era in Live\nand Let Die.\nEach actor who played Bond brought\nsomething different to the table. Each\nBond was different. Some fundamental constants remained, but the exact\nmix of traits differs wildly from actor\nto actor. I may not really have time to\nproperly dissect each one individually,\nso if I leave out your favourite, then it\u2019s\nprobably due to space restraints.\nIn the first films Bond was much more\nbrutal. He was coldly detached, but you\ncould always sense a hint of moral fibre\nin there that the job hadn\u2019t managed to\nknock out of him yet. He still retained\nthe charm and raw attractiveness.\nThen you have Roger Moore, who\nbrought out the super suave side. Although, it must be said, it did get a bit\nridiculous during his tenure. Proof:\na space battle with LASER guns in\nMoonraker. A bunch of good and bad\nguys have a firefight in spacesuits.\nHuh? Is the reaction you\u2019re looking for.\nThen it comes to the man that I think\nhas been unfairly forgotten to a large\nextent, Timothy Dalton. His two offerings are two of my favourites. He was\nthe macho, angry, ruthless spy who had\na job to do and wanted to do the right\nthing. His films definitely took the films\nin a much darker direction. They were\ndefinitely \u2018grittier\u2019, to use the current\nbuzzword. They still had Q and some\none-liners, however they were more \u2018realistic\u2019, as it were. By that I mean relatively \u2013 of course the action sequences\nweren\u2019t exactly 100% plausible.\nWhy do I think these films are over-looked? Maybe it\u2019s because there are\nonly two of them. Perhaps it\u2019s due to\nthe massive gap between the second\nDalton film and the first Brosnan film?\nMaybe they\u2019re just not good and I just\nthink they are. It\u2019s hard to tell. I think\nit\u2019s more a fact that, in a way, they\nwere almost ahead of their time. Had\nthey been made today, everyone would\npraise the harder edged, deeper Bond\nand the great balance between realistic\nand fantastical in the suspended disbelief world of Bond. Licence to Kill\nwas certainly not a fluff action film.\nTo start with, Felix Leiter, James\u2019 best\nfriend, has his wife killed and is later\nbrutally mutilated, with his legs bitten\noff by a shark. That\u2019s pretty damn in-tense. James Bond then goes on a solo\nrevenge mission against the drug dealer\nresponsible. He\u2019s angry. Sounds a bit\nfamiliar? In my view, it\u2019s the film that\nthe terribly titled Quantum of Solace\nshould have, and could have, been.\nIt must be said that in my mind Pierce\nBrosnan is what James Bond looks like.\nI did like his wry humour and that he\ninjected a lot of levity into the role.\nHis character was at ease and detached\nenough to almost find it all quite fun.\nIt\u2019s just because he is the one that I have\ngrown up with. I remember watching\nDie Another Day in cinemas. At the\ntime, to a 12-year-old boy, it was fucking amazing. Hindsight, and re-watch-ing it, tells me that maybe I was a bit\nhasty in that conclusion. I also didn\u2019t\nrealize Rocky 3 was ridiculous until seeing it again recently; my judgment as a\nchild was all over the place.\nDaniel Craig hasn\u2019t fully proven himself to me yet. Casino Royale was great\nand a refreshing change in direction. I\nfeel a bit harsh to dismiss him on the\nbasis of QOS. It wasn\u2019t his fault that\nthe script wasn\u2019t good and when asked\nwhat the plot was, most people can\u2019t\ngive a satisfactory answer.\nThe take home message, if there is\none, is that each film represents the era\nit was made in to some degree. It is a\nquite interesting point (yeah I would\nsay that wouldn\u2019t I? I wrote this after\nall) that something as seemingly non-consequential as films about a badass\nspy can throw up a point about how\ntimes have changed. It seems like the\ntwo Timothy Dalton films were a bit\nahead of their time and therefore aren\u2019t\nthought of too kindly, but time will\njudge them well. Watch The Living\nDaylights and Licence to Kill and make\nup your mind. You must at least like\nthe title song to The Living Daylights, I\nmean come on, it\u2019s by a-ha.\nLook at those blue eyes... swoon...\n\n"

Sadly, Imperial lost.

Imperial were not hopeful, but were given\na better game by Durham who recognised that we weren\u2019t the strongest\nteam there though we still managed\nto get a couple wickets against them \u2013\nan amazing catch by Natasha, bowled\nby Priya, and a run-out by our quick\nthinking wicket-keeper, Mithila.

The\nteam needed a win to defend their current ranking of 3rd place in the league,\nand to boost team morale as the two\nprevious matches had both been loss-es.The situation initially looked dire,\nas one fencer was clearly ill, and two\npeople were injured from the week be-fore.\nThe foil team, composed of Jenifer\nMizen (Jenny), Sarah Chakera, and anchored by Stephanie Martinez (Steph),\ndominated the piste, taking the lead in\nthe first match and holding onto it to\nwin 45-35. After foil, the team fenced\nsabre, during which Helen Pennington,\nSlavina Georgieva and Jing Quek won\nCricket\nNatasha Coral\nby an even greater margin, with a final score of 45-13.

The\nNSS is a survey for final year students\nconducted by Ipsos MORI, the second\nlargest market research organisation\nin the UK, on behalf of the Higher Education Funding Council for England\n(HEFCE). The results from the NSS\nhave been used heavily to determine\nstudent satisfaction levels and affect\nuniversity rankings.\nEntering the NSS via thestudent-survey.com requires the responder to\nenter the institution they are currently\nenrolled at, their student number (CID\nin Imperial\u2019s case), the first letter of\ntheir first name and the first four characters of their last name. Along with\nmerely the day and month (not year)\nof birth, this information is all that\nis necessary to undertake the survey.\nUpon entering these details, the NSS\nclaims to \u201ccheck [them] against the\nNational Student Survey 2012 target\npopulation\u201d for eligibility.\nLittle do they know many universities and their departments provide databases of students with their associated information to enrolled members.\nTake our Department of Computing\u2019s\n(DoC) TeachDB database for instance.\nStudents from this department can log\nin using their basic credentials and are\nfaced with a full search engine for stu-dents, staff, degrees, courses, UTAs,\nGTAs and books. Think in terms of\nthe database Mark Zuckerberg used to\ngrab students\u2019 pictures and start Facebook back in Harvard.\nFelix logged into the DoC TeachDB\nnetwork and performed a search for\nall students in their fourth year. No\nother details were required and we\ncan confirm wildcard searches such\nas these are allowed. What resulted\nwas a list of 160 students. We ran the\nsearch again for third year and got a\nlist of 200. Since we can\u2019t be sure all\nthird years are in their final year, we\u2019ll\ngo with the dataset of fourth years.\nThe information we got? Students\u2019 pictures, their login, their full\nfirst name and last name, the degree\nthey\u2019re on, their CID number and year\nof entry. All in a neat, tabular and machine readable format. With this in-formation, it would be a piece of cake\nto produce a proof of concept application that can automatically harvest\nfinal year student data from this data-base, cross reference it with another\nservice like Facebook (made even easier using their new social graph programming interface) for their day and\nmonth of birth (never mind privacy\nsettings, some profiles show more to\nthe Imperial network by default) and\nfill in the NSS as all of them by itself.\nAnd this is just one database in one\ndepartment \u2013 if such a thing exists in\nDoC, could other departments within\nImperial provide such accessible re-cords? In fact, taking other universities\u2019 engines and similarly readily\navailable information into account,\nsuddenly the results of the NSS don\u2019t\nseem so trustworthy anymore.\nWhat if some students have already\nfilled in the survey, however? Funnily\nenough, the exposure of a second flaw\nmakes our automated rigging process\neven more tempting. A student can\nfill in the NSS as many times as they\nwant, with their first response taking\nprecedence over all others. Simply\nput, one can write code to automate\nfilling in the survey by impersonating many students on the first day (or\neven the first few hours) of the survey\nopening, and overwrite all their future\nresponses with 100% satisfaction for\neverything eligible without the system\n\u201cAnything less than\ntotal veracity is a\ndisastrous breach of\nreputation\u201d\nUnion to lobby council\nover Exhibition Road\nTim Arbabzadah\nIn a paper brought to Union Council on\nMonday 13 February by Deputy President (Welfare) Nicolas Massie, the\nUnion proposed to lobby Westminster\nCity Council about multiple concerns\nwith the new Exhibition Road layout.\nThe paper pointed out the \u201cuncertainty\nabout the boundaries of the road on the\nwest side, particularly the tactile borders\u201d.\nIt went on to point out that the \u201cuse of\nthe \u2018roundabout\u2019 (Prince Consort Road\nand Exhibition Road) is unclear and\nhas increased the risk to cyclists\u201d.\nWhen even the Union begins to use\nquotation marks, everyone can rest assured it\u2019s absurd.\nThe \u2018roundabout\u2019 in question is located outside the Business School. This\nis, unlike every other roundabout, just\na crossroads with a circle painted on it.\nThe paper also raised concerns over the\n\u201c800 metres [of Exhibition Road] without assisted crossing\u201d.\nThe paper was ultimately passed,\nand it was decided that the Union\nshould lobby Westminster City Council to clarify several points, including\n\u201cwhether it is a shared space\u201d. Another\nissue to be lobbied for is to put up signs\ninforming people of the rules of the\nroad.\nStudent survey data could be skewed\n(or the student) batting an eyelid for\nsuspicious activity.\nFelix contacted Jason Parmar, Deputy President (Education), about the\nability to fill in the NSS many times,\nsince students were confused as to\nwhat happened to their responses. In\nan inconsistent manner, accessing the\nNSS using the introductory email and\nattempting to complete it subsequently causes it to fail with the response:\n\u201cThank you for your interest in participating in this survey. You have\nalready completed the survey\u201d. Accessing it via their website and clicking through to \u201ccomplete the survey\u201d,\nhowever, allows students to redo it an\nunbounded number of times, leaving it\nunclear what the impact is on results.\nJason Parmar contacted Senior Assistant Registrar (Quality Assurance\n& Data) Rebecca Penny, who spoke\nwith Ipsos MORI and confirmed that\n\u201cstudents can complete the survey\nmore than once, however only the first\nresponse they submit will be counted\nin the results\u201d.\nJames Greenhalgh, a DoC student,\nand Tom Wilshere, Computing Department Representative, told Felix\ntheir feelings on the matter, saying:\n\u201cfor a survey so important in informing the immediate future decisions of\nthousands of school leavers, anything\nless that total veracity is a disastrous\nbreach of reputation\u201d.\nJames raised his concerns and said\nthat \u201cif these bugs have existed in previous years then newspapers are not\nonly foolish to provide such heavy\nweighting to the results, but also damaging\u201d, adding that this \u201ccavalier approach to the futures of school leav-ers, especially given the increased\nfinancial burden they face, and to the\nfuture of already embattled academics\nshows yet another fundamental flaw\nin our country\u2019s obsessive need to\narbitrarily order all public establishments\u201d.\nThe questions which remain are\nhow long these problems have existed\nand whether other universities have\nbeen exploiting the issues described.\nCould Imperial\u2019s drop below UCL be\nexplained by us simply being more\nhonest?\nAlexander Karapetian\nRigging away?

With\nno less than four books under her name\nas well as a range of charitable commitments including Fashion Targets Breast\nCancer, and the recently launched All\nWalks Beyond The Catwalk campaign,\nCaryn Franklin is an activist, not just\nin fashion but in regard to the general\nracial, size and age discrimination that\nexists in the modern world.\nHer latest project, All Walks, founded alongside model Erin O\u2019Connor\nand former PR guru/fashion journalist\nDebra Bourne\n\u201cis an initiative to broaden the body and\nbeauty ideals we currently see in our\nfashion media\u201d. It promotes inclusivity\nin the industry \u201ccreating a message to all\nwomen\u201d.\nAlthough at first to some, it may seem\nlike an initiative against the thin ideals\ncurrent fashion modelling holds, Ms\nFranklin assures us that All Walks was\nnot designed to discriminate any group\nof people:\n\u201cWe never say \u2018real\u2019 women because\nvery thin models are real too, they\u2019re a\nprojection of femininity and beauty our\nindustry prioritises. But they\u2019re not the\nonly body ideal, which is why we\u2019re\ntrying to broaden it. We\u2019re not trying\nto stamp these women out or get rid\nof them, as some seem to think!\u201d\nAfter such a distinguished career in\nthe industry, Ms Franklin recognises that\nthere is a lack of ethnic diversity within\nfashion. \u201cIt\u2019s always been institutionally\nracist. Brands will justify it as it\u2019s what\nsells. Magazines will be reluctant to\nfeature black cover girls, because they\nfeel they don\u2019t equal the magazine sales\nof white women. Advertising wants to\nreach as many customers as possible\nand feels that it is the Caucasian beauty\nB\norn in Hertfordshire in\n1996, John Rankin Waddell has come much further than most ex-account-ing students, inspiring\nmillions of people worldwide with his\nrenowned collection of portraits. From\ntop models and famous celebrities to the\nQueen, all the way to the less glamorous Mugunga refugee camp in Congo,\nhis hefty Mamiya camera has seen it all.\nYet perhaps Rankin is best known\nfor the runaway success of Dazed &\nConfused, the original cool rebellious\nmagazine that broke boundaries and introduced unconventional new talent to\nthe creative industry. Having started out\nas a black and white fold-out poster, this\nexperimental brainchild of Rankin and\nJefferson Hack now sits on the shelves\nalongside the industry giants Vogue and\nHarper\u2019s Bazaar, becoming a stimulus\nfor the evolution of newer cult magazines such as i-D and Vice.\n20 years on and Rankin\u2019s team have\nreunited to bring us the journey of \u2018the\nmagazine that broke all the rules\u2019 in\nDazed & Confused: Making It Up As\nWe Go Along. Although labelled as a\nvisual history, this book is far from just\na collection of its controversial covers and iconic photographs. Rather, its\ninterviews documenting conversations\nbetween the magazine\u2019s\nfounders, and its snippets of insight into\nthe scenes behind the\npublication\u2019s glossy\npages, makes this\nbook so much more\nthan just an exhibition\nof pictures. Such\nwise words\nfrom these giants of the\nnew generation of\nf a s h i o n\njournalism\nand photography\nm a k e s\nthe text\nin this\np i c t u r e -centred book as\nvaluable as the stark ingenuity the photographs themselves provide, and that\nalone is more than enough to provide a\nlifetime\u2019s worth of feverish encouragement to venture upon one\u2019s own mission\nto contrive the ravishing imagery which\nlives inside each and every one of us.\nIn fact, it is this blazing need to\ncontinuously express himself, as well\nas the realisation that he will forever hold a craving to be inspired\nby those around him, that has led\nRankin to his most recent project\nHunger. A darker portrayal\nof the visions that eat at\nthose blessed with\ntalent, the bi-annual\nmagazine that is\nHunger is still\nin its early days.\nBut of course,\nbeing Rankin,\nthe engraved\ngold names on\nits consuming\ndebut cover is\nalready covered\nin stars; Dominic\nCooper, Alice Dellal, Cheryl Cole and\nHeidi Klum to name just a few. If any-thing, this is 500 pages affirming that\ntime has not made Rankin more afraid\nAlice Yang embraces her inner rebel as she investigates the quintessential rule-breaking magazine\nideal that sells more for them.\u201d\nIn fact, Ms Franklin feels that the industry has shrunk in terms of diversity\nand individuality since she entered it in\nthe 80s when she swapped a life in the\narmy for art college, in part because the\nshoes were \u201cugly\u201d. As a result of this,\nCaryn Franklin\u2019s All Walks models features women who would not otherwise\nbe commonly seen in the industry. From\nher current favourite Naomi Shimada,\ngenerally considered a plus-size model\nat a UK size 14 that Caryn describes as\na \u201ccurvy, sassy, clever model who sees\nbeyond modelling\u201d; to the 82-year-old Daphne Selfe and Sheila Atim, an\n18-year-old with a \u201cvery obvious African heritage\u201d, Caryn\u2019s pick of models\nfor All Walks define diversity.\nIn the name of promoting such ide-als, All Walks has merged politics with\nfashion, from sparking debates in parlia-ment, putting on live shows during London Fashion Week and creating exhibitions at the National Portrait Gallery, to\ntouring the country in order to educate\ncollege students. Caryn\u2019s message is\nspreading.\n\u201cFashion is full of possibilities and\nopportunities. I love the industry. I\u2019ve\nearned my living from it, but I can see\nits faults and that is why I am vocal.\u201d\nOf course to assist with such cam-paigns, All Walks has pulled in the\nprecious voluntary time of fashion\u2019s\ncr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me; from world famous\nphotographers such as Rankin and Nick\nKnight, to the eccentric Vivienne Westwood \u2013 the voice of All Walks Beyond\nThe Catwalk is most definitely not a silent one.\nLEFT: Dazed & Confused: Making It Up As We Go Along Written by Jefferson Hack, Edited by Jo-Ann Furniss.

    "content": "Scientists from the University of California,\nBerkley, have been able to successfully determine fragments of people\u2019s thoughts by decoding brain activity caused by words they hear.\nThe study has given researchers further insight into how the brain processes language\nand paves the way for devices that may be\nable to help those without the power of speech.\nResearchers believe this may be the first step\nto primitive brain implants that can monitor\npeople\u2019s thoughts and speak on behalf of them.\nThe study held in the US showed that a computer could play back words that the patients\nheard by analysing their thoughts, though the\nwords played back were sometimes not clear.\nSpeaking to The Guardian, Robert Knight,\ndirector of the Helen Wills Neuroscience Institute, said \u201cthis is exciting in terms of the basic science of how the brain decodes what we\nhear. Potentially, the technique could be used\nto develop an implantable prosthetic device to\naid speaking, and for some patients that would\nbe wonderful.\u201d\n\u201cThe next step\u201d, he continued, \u201cis to test\nwhether we can decode a word when a person\nimagines it. That might sound spooky, but this\ncould really help patients. Perhaps in 10 years\nit will be as common as grandmother getting\na new hip.\u201d\nThe study involved playing a series of words\nto the patients for up to ten minutes while recording their brain activity from electrodes\nplaced across the surface of their brain. The top\nof the patients\u2019 skulls had been removed previously in an operation to treat intractable epi-lepsy, allowing this procedure to be carried out.\nThe activity from the electrodes showed that the\nbrain broke down sound into their constituent\nfrequencies and the program kept track of this.\nAnother collection of words was then played\nto the patients to see whether the program could\ndifferentiate between words that were repeated\nfrom before and those that were new. The list\nof words included \u201cWaldo\u201d, \u201cstructure\u201d, and\n\u201cproperty\u201d. The scientists got their best results\nwhen activity was recorded in the superior temporal gyrus, above the ear. Brian Pasley, a scientist on the team, compared the technique to a\nmusician who could hear a piece in their mind\njust by knowing which notes are played.\nThe study raises implications for potential\nmind reading programs, though the scientists\npoint out that it would require the skull of the\nparticipant being opened up. Even if a device\nwere to exist without such intrusive measures,\nMind reading programs?\nNeural networks are used to simulate brain activity, but cannot interpret thoughts\nit would be difficult to differentiate between\nan inner monologue and words intended to be\nsaid aloud, therefore impacting any ability to\naid the speechless.\nThough the scientists\u2019 work must not be un-derestimated, Guardian blogger Mo Costandi\nwrote that \u201cwe are nowhere near being able to\ndecode and reconstruct such complex neural\nactivity [as our extremely rich stream of consciousness]\u201d, and that \u201cit may, in fact, never be\npossible\u201d. It is likely that \u201cyour thoughts will\nremain private for a very long time.\u201d\nDOI:10.1371/journal.pbio.1001251\nA paper in 1932 by William Holder Zachariasen hinted at the atomic structure of glass,\nwhich at the time was unexplored. This deduction was based purely on the properties of\nglass known at the time. For example, the fact\nit does not have a crystalline structure indicated that molecules within it are not symmetric.\nThis work now appears to be vindicated following new research reported in Nano Letters,\nwhich shows that a 2D layer of glass imaged\nusing Transmission Electron Microscopy\n(TEM) has an extremely similar structure to\nthat deduced in the 1932 work.\nAs with many scientific discoveries, this one\nwas partially accidental. The team intended to\nmake graphene for an experiment; however,\nunintended consequences actually resulted in\ngraphene with a layer of glass forming instead.\nThe researchers suspect that this is due to air\nleaking into the process.\nConventional glass (as found in windows) is\nmade of silicon dioxide \u2013 also known as sil-ica. The process used to create the graphene,\nin this instance, involved a quartz substrate\non carbon. When air leaked into the process,\nthis caused the carbon to be oxidised (and the\nquartz subsequently reduced). This forms silica in the same structure of glass \u2013 yet just three\natoms thick, making it effectively 2D.\nThis research is important for two reasons.\nThe first of these is to allow direct imaging of\nmolecules, some of which may not occur natu-rally.\nThe other reason is that it opens the door to\nsynthesising a wide variety of other 2D molecules through the use of a graphene substrate:\nit may be possible to produce a glass from aluminium oxide with this technique. Additionally the graphene support removes the need\nfor the variety of conditions that 2D materials\nneed to form, such as unreactivity.\nThis provided an opportunity to investigate\nthe properties of the rings within glass. One\nof the properties discovered was that the glass\nwas not covalently bonded to the graphene \u2013\nthis would cause an unacceptable amount of\nstrain within the molecule. This can be seen\nin graphical models, which show a large mismatch between the lattice of graphene and the\nglass.\nInstead, the van der Waals interactions cause\nthe attraction to occur, resulting in a stabilisa-tion effect within the glass. This shows that\ngraphene could be a core component of production of new 2D substances.\nAs for the 2D silica-based glass, this could\nhave a use in electronics, namely semicon-ductors, or as gate insulators in semiconduc-tors. This is thanks to the ease of which the\ngraphene and glass can be stripped from the\nstarting copper.\nPhilip Kent\nFELIX\nFriday 17 February 2012\n8\nscience.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nScience Editors: Kelly Oakes\nAlexander Karapetian\nSCIENCE\nIn brief\nAlexander Karapetian\nSwearing for Scientists\nby Maria Veiga\nNasa\u2019s New Horizons probe has entered the final\nstage of its journey to Pluto.

Despite its second\nhalf drifting more towards the tragic side of\nlove, there is plenty of sassy, quick-witted\nbanter between the two that allows sparks\nto fly. Add to that the sensational original\nsong written by Harry Warren, Harold Adamson and Leo McCarey, and you get one of\nthe most iconic love stories of all time. The\nEmpire State Building became more popular due to the romantic setting of this film,\nand although rather poorly adapted by Nora\nEphron in her Sleepless in Seattle, An Affair\nto Remember thankfully has its reputation\nintact.\nOther worthy nominees: Roman Holiday,\nFrom Here to Eternity, A Star is Born, The\nCountry Girl, The African Queen, Singin\u2019 in\nthe Rain\nThe 1960s: Bonnie and\nClyde\nThe strong word-of-mouth success of this\nwas the prime reason Warren Beatty, the\nstar and producer, walked away with a large\nsum of cash and Faye Dunaway was propelled into stardom in her debut role. In the\ntricky roles of a couple of bank-robbers and\neventual killers, Beatty and Dunaway make\none heck of a duo and their team, consisting of Gene Hackman, Estelle Parsons and,\nis one worth rooting for \u2013 which is why the\ntragic final scene, shot with such effective\nspeed, accuracy and sudden close-ups,\nhas more impact. Even through the tough-est, potentially life-threatening situations,\nthis brave couple copes by relying on and\nhaving faith in each other. They commit\ncrimes, and Bonnie even goes so far as\nto cheerfully exclaim \u201cwe rob banks!\u201d but\ntheir convincing passion and committment\nhave a thing or two to teach us all.\nOther worthy nominees: The Umbrellas of\nCherbourg, Splendour in the Grass, West\nSide Story, Doctor Zhivago, Breakfast at Tiffany\u2019s\nThe 1990s: Ghost\nThe late Patrick Swayze was always asked\nby fans to utter the word \u201cditto\u201d to them\nand if you\u2019re unsure as to why that is,\nwatch Ghost and find out that sometimes,\nthe words \u201cI love you\u201d are often overrat-ed. Even in death, Sam\u2019s (Swayze) soul\nlingers on Earth in order to complete his\none final task: keep his girlfriend Molly\n(Demi Moore) safe from those who had\nhim killed. Molly struggles to move on\nof course (especially after that pottery\nscene, no-one would) but not everything\nis a complete downer. With a killer comic\nrelief performance from Whoopi Goldberg\nas the sole person who can communicate\nwith the dead soul of Sam, it achieves\na nice balance between tragic romance\nand hysterical comedy, never undermining or sacrificing one another. Another\nwell-played chart-topper came from this\n\u2013 The Righteous Brothers\u2019 \u201cUnchained\nMelody.\u201d\nOther worthy nominees: The Bridges of\nMadison County, Jerry Maguire, One True\nThing, Beauty and the Beast, The English\nPatient\nThe 2000s: Atonement\nWar drives a lot of unfortunate lovers\napart, and nothing is more heart-breaking\nto see than two people who could have\nand should have been able to spend\nmore time together. Due to a little girl\u2019s\nmisguided imagination, Robbie (James\nMcAvoy) is separated from his true love\nCecilia (Keira Knightley); first being escorted to prison, then to the front line\nof the First World War. Will they ever re-unite? It\u2019s unclear throughout the course\nof the film but what is apparent is the two\nlovers\u2019 painful longing for the years and\nyears they remain apart. The final moments of the film, handled so well in their\nsheer modesty and sincerity with acting\nveteran Vanessa Redgrave shining in her\nbrief scene, are devastating yet incredibly satisfying. Although it covers a long\nduration, it is a neatly condensed, highly\nwatchable affair, immaculately presented\nby a truly talented English director, Joe\nWright.\nOther worthy nominees: Away From Her,\nOnce, Brokeback Mountain, The Notebook,\nAmelie\n\n"

We came to\nthe conclusion that the reason we weren\u2019t\nhigh on inspiration was because all the\ntalks had been focusing on the problems,\nbut none of them provided any solutions.\nLuckily, the afternoon sessions served\nup plenty of what we wanted. \u201cThe\nGreenest Government Ever?\u201d session\nkicked off the afternoon.

On energy politics of the\nfuture, he urged us to take collective ac-tion, to get involved in politics, and boldly\nsummed up the session by saying \u201cIf\nyou\u2019re under 40, you\u2019d better start doing\nsomething!\u201d\nMark Lynas kept mid-afternoon sleepiness at bay by conducting a fun and interactive session called \u201cFuture visions\u201d.\nUsing the DECC 2050 energy pathways\ncalculator, he managed to get an audience of 200 to predict the UK\u2019s energy\nsupply and demand in 2050. The good\nnews is that, with current technology, we\ncan make it to a zero carbon economy\nby 2050 (just)! The bad news is that using our demand predictions, we need to\nbe wildly ambitious about the number of\noffshore wind-farms, solar panelled roofs\nand biomass power stations we can install\nin under 40 years...\nBut unsurprisingly, like any true Imperialite, my absolute favourite session of\nthe day was called \u201cCan Technology Beat\nClimate Change?\u201d Dr. Ralph Clague of\nGordon Murray Design Limited, a world\nleader in automotive design, showed us\nhow the vision of electric powered cars\ncould become a reality. He showed us\nprototype low carbon city cars (which\nare thankfully much prettier than the Gwizz) and talked us through their new\nefficient production process called iS-tream (commendably admitting that it\nwas indeed named iStream as \u201canything\nsounds cool if you put an \u2018i\u2019 in front of\nit\u201d). In my view, the most visionary, most\nV\nery early on Saturday\nmorning, whilst Freshers\nwere making their way\nhome from Fabric, I was\nventuring across London\nfor an entirely different reason. I was battling my way through the bitterly cold\nmorning air so that I could catch a train\nfrom London Paddington to Oxford in order to attend the annual Oxford Climate\nForum. The Oxford Climate Forum is\nthe country\u2019s highest-profile conference\non climate change organised entirely by\nstudents bringing leading thinkers and\ndoers under one roof to discuss the key\nenvironmental concerns facing the global\ncommunity.As a sustainability enthusiast,\nnot even the malfunctioning heating systems on Great Western trains could deter\nmy excitement about this event. It was\n7am on a Saturday morning, I was sat on\na (literally) freezing cold train and I was\nraring to go!\nUnfortunately, things weren\u2019t entirely\nthat idyllic. I\u2019d managed to persuade a\nfriend from UCL to come with me, and\nwhilst I was feeling gleeful and inspired\nas we trundled past frost-covered fields\nglittering in the morning sun, she was\nfeeling tired, cold and in desperate need\nof caffeine. I sure hoped that this event\nwould be worth the journey.\nThe first talk of the morning was from\nlawyer Polly Higgins, who pledged that\nwe need to govern the planet\u2019s right to\nlife as we do for humans. In order to do\nthis she believes that Ecocide is the missing 5th Crime Against Peace and that it\nshould sit alongside genocide as an international crime throughout the world.\nShe made a convincing argument and\nmanaged to express what can sometimes\nsound like hippy-speak in an authoritative manner. However, I was not blown\naway. Imposing laws and trying to change\nsocial attitudes is not, in my view, the best\npathway to a sustainable future.\nOther morning sessions threw up difficult questions such as \u201cdo developing nations have a right to rapid development or\na responsibility to develop sustainably?\u201d\nand \u201chow can we equitably share the burden of climate change?\u201d The issues raised\nwere tackled with vigour, intellect, and\nenthusiasm, with speakers from a broad\nrange of backgrounds, including aca-demia, business, and charity offering a\nfar-reaching and deep range of expertise.\nEven seemingly impenetrable questions\nsuch as \u201chow can you ask people in pov-Gate crashing the Oxford Climate Forum\nCaroline Wood escapes London for a sustainable future\nambitious and most exciting solution was\ncalled DESTERTEC. DESERTEC\u2019s vision is to harness solar energy from de-serts, and transport the energy generated\nvia international grids. Yes, that\u2019s deserts\n(meaning Africa and the Middle East)\nand international grids (meaning political negotiations). I told you it was ambi-tious. However, given the fact that in just\n6 hours deserts receive more energy from\nthe sun than human-kind consumes in a\nyear, it seems the idea is worth pursuing\nin spite of political and funding issues.\nJeremy Leggett, described by the Observer as \u201cBritain\u2019s most respected green\nenergy boss\u201d, a social entrepreneur, and\nauthor of The Carbon War and Half Gone\ngave a compelling closing speech. Pragmatic and persuasive, Jeremy left us with\nsome motivating closing thoughts: we can\nuse existing technologies to get where we\nwant to be. If we mix and match existing technologies, we can domestically\nprovide enough energy for the UK. But\n\u201cHow can we\nequitably share the\nburden of climate\nchange?\u201d\npeople are scared to listen to warnings\nabout peak oil. There is a deeply rooted\ndefence of the status quo, and we need\nseismic change that can make green ideas\ngo viral and go global.\nSo there you have it. A great day came\nto an end. 200 people ventured out of\nOxford\u2019s town hall, into the freshly fallen snow, feeling motivated and inspired\nto keep working towards a sustainable\nfuture \u2013 my sceptical friend from UCL\nincluded.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re under 40,\nyou\u2019d better start\ndoing something!\u201d\nFEATURE\nFELIX Friday 17 february 2012 7\n\n"
