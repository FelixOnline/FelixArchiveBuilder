    "content": "^ELIX\nPROFILE ALISON\nENTWISTLE\nThe President of Imperial College Women's Association\nlikes to consider herself a Londoner, for although born in\nSt. Helens, Lancashire she could not stand the northern\naccents for more than the first year of her life. She finds\nmuch to her annoyance, that her family takes her scholastic\nsuccesses for granted, for her sister is a chemist and her\nbrother a physicist, which explains why Alison is a Mathematician. Her father was a minister of religion, but we\nhave too little space to explain Alison's own complex views\non religion here.\nAlison's education was Li a normal girls' school,\nwhere they thought her brilliant. They gave her no choice\nas to which college to attend, bringing her streak of\nobstinacy to the fore by telling her she would never get a place at I.C. Alison triumphed with a State Scholarship\nand is now vre ll installed in her final year.\nApart from organising the affairs of ICY/A, Alison\nremains one of :\nhe few members \"^w rtl& ve represented I.C. in all the possible wc ra en's te>ms - although she admits she\nonly really enjoys playing tennis.\nIn spite of her size, Alison is a keen mountaineer and\nin past years has been a cyclist over large areas of England\nand Ireland. This summer however she found a more exciting\nform of transport in Sweden. She spent several weeks\ntaking the tops off strawberries and picking bad peas off a conveyor beit,'in order to earn enough money BO hitchhike to Stockholm, although this necessitated sitting on\nlorry driver's knees. One of the few words Alison learned\nwas the Swedish for 'no'.\nAlison's artistic gifts range from the care of one ivy\nplant which she is training along a crack in her hostel room\nwall, to a love of music, particularly piano music. She\nhas had seven years tuition in piano playing and can occasionally be heard in the early hours of the morning bashing\nduets on the gym piano.\nWhen asked for some likes and dislikes our President\ntold us that when young the way to gain her attention was\nto sit on a plate and make a noise like a chocolate biscuit.\nThough this delicacy is still a favourite we find that she\n.also likes collecting things, the most notable being a collection of teaspoons gathered, honestly, from many parts\nof Britain and the Continent. These are stock equipment\nfor all ICVfA coffee parties. Among her other likes we have\ncrumpets, corncobs, astronomy (looking at stars - alone),\nbridge (in an amateur fashion) and some men. We found she\nha3in differences including politics, mathematics and some\nmen. Her dislikes are chiefly intolerance and pro pog and a, marmalade, people who smoke in buses, and some other men.\nThe President of the most select group in the college is\nan interesting and amusing person, though always funniest\nwhen she does not mean to be. We can also proudly say that\nAlison is respectable - at least we thought so until we\ndiscovered her knitting a baby's cardigan and the presence\nof a pram in' the corridor outside her room. However this\nwas satisfactorily explained by the pram belonging to the\nDramatic Society and the cardigan was for Alison's niece.\nWe heaved a sigh of relief - or was it disappointment?\nHEIGH HO!\nWhat would you do\nIf you were me?\nI can't remember\nMy A.B.C. Just keep an smoking the whole day long.\nFluid flow's bad,\nHeat transfer's worse,\nIda ren't write down\nWhat I think in verse\nLooks like I'll fail my exams again.\nI'm fed up with life. And scared of death,\nI 've run out of paper\nAnd run out of breath.\nReckon I'll go and have another drink.\nTEAPOT.\nHOW TO GET RICH QUICK\"\nby\nrt Blank Squiggle\nPerhaps, you may say, money grows on gooseberry\nbushes. Well, let me assure you, it most certainly does not.\nHowever, there are one or two ways in wh i oh le lucre (as the French say) may be obtained at as light discount. These ways fall into two cl as ses :-1. Class F. Methods by which money is actual-ly made,\n2. Class S. Methods by which one's petty cash\nrises by not spending what one already has. It is possible to prove, however, that if one has an amount of money x, and Class S. is employed, the tot-al resultant cash stock being TL,\nx4x, whereas the desired result is x \u00bb> x We shall, therefore, discount Class S. as\nu.f. f.u., or \"useless for further use\".\nClass F. may be divided into (a) Manufacturing processes, and (b) Recovery processes.\nP.(a)(1) The direct manufacture process:\nFor this you will need a couple of pan teo hn icons, an island in the Atlantic, a private army,\na motor cruiser, a paper mill or silver mine, (we\ndiscount copper as not lucrative enough) and a few\nother odds and ends which you can pick up in Woolworth's or Leslie' s. The idea is to borrow the\ncoin presses in the Royal Mint, ship them to your\nisland and get to work. A small bribe should fix\nit with the of fi oi als concerned.\nP.(a)(11) Expansion process :\nThe essence of this method is to cut each coin\nneat xy in two edgeways. Now cut away the centre\nand fill the gap with glue to hold the coin together again. Apply method (1) to the coin-metal gain-ed, or sell to other dealers for a small fee.\nNow we come to the recovery processes. These\nfall into two o lasses: F.(b)(1) Dishonest methods :\nThese are by far the most moneymaking, but are\nfrowned upon by the constable;\nF.(b)(11) Slightly honest methods ;\nThese include\nF.(b)(11)A. Horse-race betting. For this you\nwill need ( i) a horse-race, ( ii) some capital,( iii) no sense, ( iv) a pin. There are several\ntext books on the subject, so Is hall not enter\ninto great detail. Suffice it to say that, pro-vi ded you use the'pin sensibly, you cannot lose.\nP.(b)( ii) B,. Football \"pools\". A clever idea.\nYou cannot lose (see MoGugglebreck: \"The Luck of\nthe Pools, Waddle & Turnback, Is.). One thing,\nthough \u2014 you will have to join the Football Pool\nPromoter's Association. P.(b)( ii) C. Crown & Anchor. This is another good\nway if you can afford t ne bits and pieces. Making 14s. per hour is not hard, provided you are the\nbanker. Be careful! Keep your cash in your pocket\nand wear a belt and braces, otherwise the weight of\nyour winnings may be given away to the other play-ers. Alternatively, you may take a wheelbarrow.\nThat completes the list. It rust that you\nnow have no fears about what will happen when you\nget thrown out of I.C.( copyright reserved)\nPYTHAGORAM\nE6t*4t \u00bb\nt Across: ( l)4a+ a(3) a+ b(5)6a(7)2c/3+2(8)5 b,+c/3(9) b3 Downs (1) (c+10)2b/6(2)7a b(4)b2+3(6)2c2+( a1) "

    "content": "6 FELIX\nf Pil TU.L. RUGBY CUP 2nd ROUND\nWestminster College 6 pts. Imperial College 9 pts.\nThis time the College XV really began like cup-holders. The Westminster defence was severely\ntested when Ferris made a well-judged diagonal punt\nahead, and again when Spooner ran strongly on the\nright wing. There was no early score, but after\ntwenty minutes some fast, accurate passing by the\nback line brought the ball to Palmer with room to\nrun, and be crossed in the corner for an excellent\ntry. Further attacks included a passing movement\nby the forwards from a line out, completed by a kick\nto the corner flag; but this effort was stopped by\nthe half-time whistle. Soon after tbe interval,\nfrom a heel on the Westminster '25' Holnan cut\nthrough in splendid style and handed on to Jones\nand Palmer for the latter to score again. Then\nLewis, who had been just short with the two conversions, kicked a penalty goal to make it90. At\nthis stage a thick mist began to blot out the field and the play became only intermittently visible. The touch-line theory that I.C. were coasting comfortably home was rudely shaken by two penalty goals\nto Westminster fro a quite unnecessary infringements.\nWith ten minutes left anything could have happened\nin such strange conditions, but fortunately the\nforwards mono polis ed the ball from a series of line-outs, and regained control of the proceedings.\nThis was a greatly improved performance,\nalthough the team is still slow to seize on defensive\nfumbles, and more variety in attack would turn scoring potential into points. Tha backs were well-served by Pontin and handled efficiently. The\nforwards, though sometimes ragged in the loose scrum s, generally held the upper hand and won a satisfactory\nshare of the ball. SQUASH CLUB CUP RUN ENDED After a record breaking season last year, most of the\nstalwarts of the Squash Club disbursed to far corners of\nthe globe; leaving the Club practically devoid of experienced players. Although a number of good cl as3 freshmen\nJoined iur ranks there were no\"windfalls\" oom parable to\n\u2022that of last year and aa a result, it was realised that\nthe role of the club would be to maintain the fixtures and\nbuild up a fresh team in the hope of another record season\nlater on.\nSo far this term both teams have won several matches\nand lost rather more, but all have been well fought and\nthoroughly enjoyed. Unfortunately, in common with a number\nof other I.C. clubs, our hold on the U.L. Cup was relinquished in the first round.\nThe club is evidently as popular as ever this year;\nthis being shown by the very large entry of 46 for the\nWhiteley Cup tournament and the fact that all coaching\ndates for the term had been fully booked within the first\nweek.\nFinally, the Club would like to pat its tribute to\nthat 'Grand Old Man* of squash, Jeff Kenyon, who left I.C. for Africa earlier this month. Jeff, had captained the Club\ntwi oe, won the Whiteley cup six years running, played as the\nCollege first string for the same number of years and added greatly to the prestige of the Club and College by his\nsportsmanship. Thank you, Jeff.\nCross-Country Club\nThe bad start to the season is gradually being rectified. We have now beaten Keble College, Oxon.,Queen Mary\nCollege and Exeter University in first team matches,\nalthough we have lost to Walton A.C., IJ.II.A. Sandhurst,\nand Reading and Southampton Universities.\nThe 'A* and second teams ha vu done better having\na60 j \u00a3 record of .success.\nIndividually, Pain and Bailey have been U.L. first\nteam regulars. Norman Huxford, our captain has been running\nwell all season, but special mention must be made of\nAllnatt, whose improvement of form over last year has\namazed us all. We must await the U.L. Championships next Saturday12th December.\nSHOOTING\nAgain this season, despite strong efforts to\navoid it, none of the I.C. teams shot well at\nfirst. But the Lady Fortune has been on our side,\nand despite low scores, 8 of the 9 matches whose\nresults are published have been won, and the other\ntied.\nIn the Inter-Varsity League, I.C.\"A\" heads the\ntable with 2 wins in2 matches, although not\nleading on aggregate score. This may be put right\nwith the next score-sheet, however, for in its3 rd. match the \"A\" team obtained the record score of 790\nout of a possible 800; a great credit to all con-cern ed. Without detracting from personal glory,\nthis score is a gratifying result of the recent\npurchase of 2 first class target rifles for the u ee of the more skilled shots.\nThe \"B\" team beat Birmingham \"B\", but tied with\nDurham \"B\" and so must look to their laurels in the\n2nd. Division. All three I.C. teams in the U.L. League have won their first round matches.\nOn Wednesday 25th November, I.C.R.C. was at\nhome to the Metropolitan Police 1st. Ten, who were\nnarrowly beaten after an excellent match. Later,\nover beer and sandwiches, the visiting Captain\npresented a silver spoon to 1.11. Abbott, who had\nmade the highest score (a \"possible\") on the I.C. side. The evening eventually came to a reluctant\nclose amid arrangements for a return match in May.\nAmid the spate of matches, club competitions\ncontinue as usual, and It bodes well for future\nyears that a number of new members are showing\npromise. The Club Championship, Freshers' Handicap, Pistol Championship, and other annual competitions will be shot next term; the Annual Dinner\nwill be held on Thursday 25th. Maroh.\nIAE.S. EE\nYour announcement last week about two new\nSocial Clubs to be set up in I.C. have inspired a group of Miners to set up an organisation which,\nthough it cannot by any stretch of the imagination\nbe included under the Social Clubs, dv'je per fo. rn a function very similar to, and in fact much more\nfundamental than that performed by any of the others.\nThis is provisionally named the Inter-Collegiate\nAssociation for the Exchange of Students for Social\nFunctions. It is not yet known if any of the other\nColleges would co-operate, but there ie no reason\nwhy they should. In that event, it will be renamed\nthe I.C. Association . . . etc. As readers will no\ndoubt have guessed by now, this exchange is limited\nto female students only. It ie modelled on tha\nexcellent International Association for the Exchange\nof Students for Technical Experience, which has been\nof so much use to I.C. students. Run along the\nsame lines, it will have similar regulations and a comparable standard of efficiency, which means it will be very efficient.\nStudents need partners for various reasons:\none which is excellent for a Bridge party might not\nbe quite the type to be invited to a21 st birthday\ncelebration. One to whom you might enjoy reading\nKeats' (or for that matter your own) poetry would\nnot be very suitable a partner for a Carnival, and\nso on. What we propose to do is to set up a Register of names and details of several people.\nJust the same as the Vacation Work scheme, one will\nhave to pay a small registration fee. After a while, both of the parties concerned will make\nreports on each other, and these will be added to\nthe files. This of course is only the germ of the idea,\nand considerable research and organisation will have to be done before anything definite can happen.\nWe need helpers to take this plan a stage further,\nand would invite any of your readers to contact us\nfor details. All information, of course, remains\nsecret.\nPlease address all letters to the Eon. Sec, I. A. E.F.F. S., via the Union Rack. All letters will\nnot be promptly dealt with, though some might be.\nThe President's decision will be final in all cases.\nEditor's Note: We found this in the Rack, with no\nsignature or any indication of the identity of the\nauthor. Even if it was indicated, though, he (we\npresume that I. C.W. A. members will not do anything\nof this nature, the sweet little souls!) would wish to\nremain anonymous in any case. FELIX Kill'welcome any\nmore information on the progress of this scheme.\nPublished by the fU LIx Board. Imperial College Union. London. S.W.7. Printed by i\" II Vous Phil lid., 1. E shi bit ion Rd..

    "content": "FELIX\ns NOW?DANCE ~ THE TRUDGE Many of us who have attended recent social functions in the University have noticed a growing\ndissatisfaction with dancing in its present for iu. Pleasure is our tailed by the possession of\nlarge, ungainly feet or the inability to oom pre he nd complex dance patterns; and, too, the tempo of many\nmodern dances is such as to rapidly induce a state\nof acute fatigue. It is with this in mind that we\nbring to the notice of Imperial College this new and\nenthralling social pastime, The Trudge.\nThe Trudge is, essentially, pure dancing in which the restrictions of physiology and anatomy\nare eliminated, and the pleasures of free, rhythm io movement can be enjoyed to the full. Pre-existing forms of da no ing are disregarded\nto achieve the supreme object of any art, simplicity. Now that the Trudge is here, there can be no\nexcuse for the person who \"can't dance this one\".\nThe Trudge is dan oed in strict time to any tune and\nany rhythm, at q ne step per bar.\nIn contrast to that extremist offshoot, the\n\"Creep\", no uniform is neo ess ary j but for those who\nwish to dress for the occasion, cloth caps and muff ler s are to be recommended and, for the ladies, gypsy soar ves or turbans.\nThose of us who are old enough to recall the\ndays of the \"old soft shoe\" will find a nostalgia in its elegant promenade, whereas the more youthful\nelement o an \"go to town\" in such variations as the\n\" All aboard\" and the \"Burly\". In fact, all mood B and caprices o an find expression in this unique\nrecreation. Here is ada no e which lends itself to\ninnumerable spontaneous innovations but, for the\nbenefit of the beginner, we set forth below some of\nthe more important steps in detail. The average\nperson should encounter no difficulty once the fundamental step is mastered.\nBASIC TRUDGE :\nCommence: feet together, facing partner.\n1. On any beat of bar place right foot12 inches in front of left foot, transfer-ring weight to right foot.\n2. On corresponding beat of next bar place\nleft foot 12 inches in front of right foot\nbringing weight onto left foot. Repeat \"ad lib\". Lady contra.\nFor advanced dancers, we recommend\nTHE \"LOGRYTHMI01:\nCommence:\nBar one.\nBar two.\nBar three. Bar four. Bar five. from the Basic Trudge. Put right foot4 inches in front of left foot. Put left foot8 inches in front of right foot. Put right foot16 inches in front \"of left foot. Put left foot32 inches in front of right foot. Put right foot64 inches in front of left foot. Repeat to the'n' th. To conclude, let us( the authors) say that we\nenvisage the advance of Trudging on a nationwide basis. We see the institution of Trudge Hops,\nTrudge Balls, Square Trudges and Barn Trudges, and\nyes, even the annual election of many aMiss Trudge\nWe invite you to the Trudge in the words from\nthe Trudge Hoe-down (to be presented shortly) :\nIntroductory Chord)\nCaller: Dishonour your partners!( Crashing Chord)\nCaller: Rosin on the bow\nAnd away we go j( Jolly tune) Take your partner by the hand, Trudge down the room to war gg^ J he When you get there, don't remain, Butv Trudge around and back again.

Dear Sir,\nThe R.C.S. has made up its mind. We do not intend to\nparticipate in a Morphy Day Rag. In the past few years the\nRags have developed into vulgar brawls, as witnessed in the\nR.C.S. building this year after the mobs had returned to\nSouth Ken., and it is felt that if a Rag is desirable a more\nsuitable day could be chosen.\nThis year the R.C.S. assembled on the towpath to support\nthe Morphy and Lowry crews and for no other reason. You,\nSir, obviously regard the races of minor importance and\nsuggest that it is only the Rags on which the success or\nfailure of Morphy Day depends. The R.C.S. Boat Club captain appealed to a Union Meeting for support of his crews\nand this he got with very pleasing results which made it a very successful Morphy Day as far as the R.C.S. was con-cern ed. Unfortunately your Editorial attacked me personally\nand I should like to point out how unfair you were in your\ncomments. Because of my association with the Soccer Club\nmy loyalties on that day were regret ably divided. As\nPresident of R.C.S. I should have liked to have given vocal\nsupport to the R.C.S. crews but as Captain of the R.C.S. A. F.C.I honestly thought that my presence on the Soccer field was\nmore urgently required. The results proved my case. Many\nother R.C.S. Union officials were in the same predicament as\nmyself and they too decided to support their respective Clubs.\nThe attitude of the R.C.S. on the question of the Morphy\nDay Rag must not be misconstrued as a general attack on all forms of Rags. This is definitely not so. We hope to take\npart in some, well conducted, good humour ed, Rags in the\nfuture and, indeed, correspondence to this effect has been\nexchanged between the President of Guilds and myself.\nTours Sincerely,\nJ. Anderson.\nWhisky Song\nThe Lecturer stood in the theatre,\nBut the benches were barren and cold,\nFor Christmas had came to the college,\nAnd students had left for the fold.\nThe Lecturer went to the Staff room.\nIt also was chilly and bare.\nBut there was a bottle of whisky.'\n- Having a nap in a chair.\nThe Lecturer woke up the whisky,\nHe'd never drunk any before.\nHe quaffed this fortified spirit\nAnd tumbled inert to the floor.\nThey found his corpse next half session,\nThe moon was then at the full.

Hudge of the R.C.S. The bar extension upstairs was kept very busy all the time, though we suspect that the barmen themselves had something to\ndo with it. On the stage, leaning against the mike, was\na yellow enamelled sign that had been mocking\nsome members of the FELIX Board for a considers\u2014,\nble time, and they finally managed to get It at\nan almost nominal price(34 pints of beer ) for the big night. The price, one must add, was not\npaid to the owners, a respectable book-shop near\nSth. Ken station but to the procurers who showed\ngreat energy and ingenuity. This sign may in the\nfuture become our mascot, replacing the paper head\nthat we lost to 1 Northampton, an year ago.\nThe Dance itself was remarkable for. he number\nof prizes:108; the continuous interruptions; the film show; and the utter chaos that threatened our I.C.

Circulation: 1200.\nThe success_ of the Birthday Dance was due\nentirely to the hard work put in by several pe o ple. The Editor wishes to thank in particular Messrs. Piggott, Bray (the M.C.), Seeley, Grimshaw, Starmer, Thomas, Deacon and Grasham; Misses\nHamilton and McKenzie; Stan Wardle and the Entertainments Committee; Dave Cox and Paul Harding\nfor serving behind the Bar; and the several others who offered help and suggestions.\nCOMPETITION RESULTS\nNobody - but nobody - submitted an entry for the Ideal Dinner competition announced in the\nlast issue of FELIX, and naturally there are\nno results to announce. The Editor considers it av indie ation of n is views, expressed last year in an unpublished viewpoint, that people in I.C. do not care a hit for their palates, and\ntherefore deserve the tasteless food they used\nto get in the Refectory. Perhaps you cannot afford very good food in restaurants; but at least dreaming up a good meal should not be too difficult for intelligent people who boast of a University education, developed tastes, and all the rest of it. Be that as it may, let us go on to\nthe next Competition.\nThis was the Limerick Competiibion announced\non the Dance ticket, where two lines of a lime rio k were given and you were asked to finish it. The preliminary sorting out was done while the\"\nDance people were busy looking at the film show.\nThe reduced entry was then further scrutinised by a panel under as light mental fog, and a very much reduced number - 5 to be exact - was then\nread out by the respective poets to the audience.( Tn is was necessary because the Editor refused to read out two of them, and also because it was\nbetter from the competitors' point of view.) Audience applause was made the basis for the final decision, and it unmistakably selected one by Ray Bonnet t, our Theatre critic: An amorous student from France Who went to the last FELIX dance, Because of the fog Made love to a dog Whioh accounts for the poodles of France. The difficulty encountered in rhyming 'dance'\nwas well expressed by another: I 've tried day and night To get this b verse right Damn FELIX damn the student damn romance.\nA large number of ladies also submitted quite strong entries, one from Bedford going: Thought love in a mist Meant more than just kissed And went home with a kick in his pan*e.A Westfield student produced this one:\nTo the gay life unused, Became quite, quite bemused,\nAnd returned to his home in a trance. These show almost all the rhymes for 'dance'\nthat were offered, the others being glance and\nadvance, of which the latter was exploited in many subtle ones.\nMany good rhymes were spoilt by not having a good enough situation. Mess rs. D. and V. Atkinson, McChesney, Berenbaum and Stuart submit ted good vere e, but were not i ju it e up to the mark.\nFinally, thanks to the man who started all this: Watt A Wordsworth, who composed the first two lines and refused to do any more.\n\"wr.TT\" Editorial Board:\nEditor Emeritus: A. E. Bray; News: G.H. Stermer;\nFeatures: D.A. Deacon; Sports: L. P.R. Harding;\nPhotography: J. Kosky; Coming Events: G. Grimshaw.\nProduction: J.S. Seeley; Circulation: W. J. Hudson;\nPublicity: D.

(Preferably\none from R.C.S. and one from Guilds.)\nLast Tuesday evening a party of a dozen\nGuildsmen found themselves in the Bar of Univers it y College with the intention of enjoying what\nhad been billed as a\" Joint Smoking Concert\".\nThis was the first venture of its kind and was an\nattempt by the Engineering Societies of Kings,\nQ.M. C.,U. C. and Guilds to bring about closer cont act ber we en their members. U.C. offered to be\nthe hosts at the first of what is hoped will turn out to he an annual event. Unhappily, as a Smoking Concert, the event was a failure since nothing\nhad been done to organise any form of entertainment\nother than a supply of beer (not free, but much\ncheaper than at I.C.) and a piano. The evening\ndegenerated into a beer y sing-song whose only merit\nlay in the large repertoire that is forthcoming\nwhen the experts of four colleges get together.\nThe highlight of the evening was a spirited rendering of the escapades of D.E. Dick, and Othersa rare enough event these days. Five minutes\nbefore closing time the handful of Guildsmen left showed the others how a College Yell should be\ndone and the evening came to a close. It is hoped that next year, Guilds will be\nthe hosts and perhaps then we will have a Smoking\nConcert.\nTHE GREAT QUESTICN(With apologies to the Bard.)\nHAMLET. Act III. Scene I.

EXPERIENCE\nI was enjoying my daily aperitif of Harpic and Orange\nin the little Comer seat that I usually occupy at Sarspar ella's Spaghetti Emporium, my thoughts were else v here, winging away in the great beyond, in the lofty plane of the\nupper mind, the imagination.\nThen Lola came into my life. No words can describe Lola. She was just magnificent,\nas she slunk seductively towards me, her hips swinging with\nthat smooth, sophisticated, rhythmic motion, I knew that I was experiencing sc me thing new, something daringly different.\nMy hand trembled, my mouth went dry, my heart ceased to beat;\nI was her slave completely and there was nothing I could do\nabout it. She was not blonde, or raven haired, or even a brunette; she was a dazzling, vivacious, enchanting red-head. Her eyes were large and limpid, intelligent eyes\nset as a pair of jewels in the heart shaped frame of her\nface. She was slim; and she was sleek; her legs were\nlong and well proportioned, and v/ ith every movement you\nexperienced virility virility virility Her whole\ndemean our gave you a sense of the jungle, a sense of primitive force which at a moments notice would buis st out to\nthrow aside the cloak of civilized respectability wh i oh now\nconcealed her character. And yet you felt you wanted to\ntake her into your arms and caress her, and to whisper\nsweet nothings into her ear whilst she stroked up against\nyour cheek.\nI have since bought Lola and I intend exhibiting her\nat next year's Crystal Cat Show.\nDead Eyed Dick\nSolution to Py th ago ram:a=9; b=12;c=15;222&+ b=o The Sir Arthur Ackland\nENGLISH ES3AX PRIZE.\nThis Competition, Ttiich is restricted to under-graduates, has the 15th of January, 1954, as the final\ndate of entry.
