    "content": "2 FELIX\neditorial Michael Williams\nAT THE time of going to press, a decision has not yet been reached by the\nExecutive as to which Sine they are\ngoing to per sue at next Monday's Council concerning the future of the FELIX sabbatical. The matter has to rest\nultimately' with Council since it is\nresponsible for and has overall control\nof the Union's finances. The need for a fourth sabbatical has yet to be justified\nto Council. The President has outlined\nthe need for a fourth sabbatical to me\npersonally but I am unable to say that I was overwhelmingly convinced. I am\nalso very grateful to the Executive for\nallowing me to sit and discuss the matter\nwith them. But the most disturbing\naspect of this whole affair as far as I can see is that whilst there has been\nmuch discussion on the possibility of a non-sabbatical FELIX Editor, there has\nbeen very little discussion on the\npossibility of non-sabbatical Junior\nTreasurer.\nMy own view on the subject remains\nadamant: Without a sabbatical Editor, even a fortnightly FELIX will be imp ossi ble and vacation issues for PCs will be non-starters. So as a means of\ncommunication, FELIX will be of no use\nand there are many technical points\nwhich support this view.\nDo you want a weekly FELIX, a communications facility? Or do you want\na dead Cat? The choice is Council's. The reason for FELIX being only six pages long this week is due,in part, to\nthe fact that Catherine, our very hard\nworking var i typist, was away sick on\nMonday, which is the most important\nvar i typing day. The var it y per itself has\nnot been behaving as well as it should\nthis week either. The decision to make\nit a six-page issue was taken on Monday\nand we have stuck to it rather than take\nthe risk of re-designing the issue and\nfinding ourselves pushed for time (rather\nmore than usual on Thursday.\nAlso, due to the limited space ava il able, it was decided to defer John\nRandall' s letter until next week. Is that\nOK, Vaughn Phillips?\nThe winner of the Prize Crossword\nlast week is Andrew Walker of Physics 2.\nN.F. Speaks\nDept. of Zoology,\n19th Jan., 1975.\nDear Sir,\nAs a black 'lefty', Trev\nPhillips is, no doubt quite\nimpartial about the National\nFront, but in his latest outburst ( FELIX No.374, 'Preci-Pice') he has shown both an\napparent ignorance of the aims\nand ideas of the N.F. and, also, the basically totalitarian attitude of all lefties' to opinions\nwhich they do not happen to\nshare.\nThe National Front has\nalways believed that British( i.e. 'white') people should be\nput first in what is, after all, their own country, and that the\nappointment of foreign im-migrants, such as 'Lord' David Pitt, chairman of the G.L.C., to positions of power over\nBritish people is fundamentally\nwrong, and, therefore, anyone\nvoting for the N.F. has always\nbeen voting for a100% British 'establishment', so, in that\nsense, the N.F. is, and always\nhas been, '100% racialist' \u2014 but\nthe Afr ici an and Indian\nnationalist movements, which\nTrev Phillips presumably\nadmires, take exactly the same\nattitude to foreigners in their\ncountries: we the National\nFront are simply a British\nnationalist movement Despite\nthe opinions of our President,\nthere is nothing new or\n'presumably' about any of this,\nit is common knowledge to\nanyone who has bothered to\nread any N. F.bu mph, as\nopposed to reading what people\nsay about the N.F. Mr. Phillips' comments about\nthe 'Hitler was right' brigade\nbeing in the ascendancy in the\nN.F. are utter rubbish, and\nshow, once again, how little he\nknows about our party. Hitler was, in the opinion of most, if\nnot all, N.F. members, a thoroughly evil man, as was\nStalin, the only difference\nbetween them being that Nazi tyranny died in1945, whereas\nCommunist tyranny is still very\nmuch around. Far from the N.F. being Nazi, the wife of our\nchairman, Mr.John Kingsley Read, lived in Nazi occupied Europe and suffered considerably at the hands of the\nGermans; Mr.Read himself was\nawarded a medal for services\nrendered to the Polish people\nduring the last war, and the\nN.F. today has many Jewish members (just as we have many\nMethodists, C of E, Roman\nCatholics and agnostic members). We do not admit black people to\nour Party because we believe that, if a black person really\nbelieved in our policies, he or\nshe would see that the best\nthing they could do to help\nBritian is to go back where\nthey came from rather than\nhanging around depriving\nBritish people of jobs, houses,\netc.\nFinally, Mr. Phillips lets\nhis real opinion of British democracy show by demanding\nthat the N.F. be prosecuted as\ntheir policies and activities are\n'unlawful' \u2014 presumably under\nthe anti-democratic Race Relations 'Act'. The National Front is a party of democracy,\nand under an N.F. government\nanyone will be perfectly free to\nput forward his point of view\nwithout let or hindrance,\nprovided only he does not use\nviolence (or advocate the use\nof violence - IS, IMG, CPE( ML) etc. beware!) to gain his FELIX\nMichael J.

Straight from\nthe bully, I.C. launched into the\nattack.

    "content": "FitlX S ft RC Of tDS Roger Wilkins\nDavid Rose: The Special Magic of\nDavid Rose (Polydor).\nAH! OF COURSE! David Rose. Who's David Rose? Well, he seems to be an\nageing American arranger who has a talent for turning popular songs into the\nmost unbearable kind of Radio 2 type\nslush. What he has done to Bob Dylan' s 'Mr. Tambourine Man' on this LP is\nunspeakable, and he shows his complete\nlack of understanding of the song.\nAccording to the Polydor blurb, in the\nlate thirties, when Rose was employed by\nthe Mutual Broadcasting organisation in\nthe States, he was not allowed a full\norchestra, but only a string section: it\nshows. Whilst one is vaguely aware that\nthe rest of the orchestra is there, the\nstrings screech their way to the surface.\nFor a person such as myself, brought up on\nrock, and classical music, it is an\nunpleasant noise.\nThe most bearable tracks to listen to\nare the four written by Rose himself, as\nyou can avoid having to cringe at what is\ndone to recognisable material.\nThis type of music belongs to a past\ngeneration. 'The Special Magic of David\nRose' is a record to avoid.\nDad's Army (BBC)\nCONSIDERING THE BBC'S current\nfinancial problem, with associated\nprogramme cutbacks, it is not surprising\nthat they are trying to make maximum\nprofit from their popular TV series.\nSo, Dad's Army went from TV to radio,\nand two of the radio tapes are now available on th fs LP. I doubt that someone who has\nnot seen the TV version- would find this\nrecord funny, as a lot of-the buffoon ing of Captain Mainwaring's Home Guard\nplatoon is very visual. Nevertheless.the\ncharacters are strong enough to rise a smile even in radio format; especially, of course, that mainstay of Dad's Army,\nCorporal ('They don't* like it up 'em')\nJones, alias Clive Dunn.\n'Sergeant Wilson's Little Secret', the\nCONCR ft T first side, is built around a misunderstanding by Mainwaring of Sgt. Wilson's relationship with Mr s.Pike. He believes\nthat Mr s.Pike is to have Wilson's baby\n(Private Pike, 'Do / have to call you\n'daddy' now, Uncle Arthur') with predictable consequences. Although the main\nlaughs come elsewhere, when the platoon\ndemonstrates its incompetence and\nimpotence during a talk on Mainwaring on\ncamouflage; to be able to get a camouflage\nscene across on radio is an achievement\nindeed.\n'Something nasty in the vault', creates\nthe ludicrous situation of Capt. Mainwaring and Sgt.Wilson sitting in the bank\nvault beneath a hole in the manager's office floor, holding an unexploded German\nbomb on their laps, unable to move. The\nensuring drama is again predictable, but\nthen, the humour is not in the plot.\nIf you find Dad's Army boring, you wii l find this LP pathetic; however, the\nrecord is evidently for addicts, and if you\nhave read this far, you had better buy it\nbefore the withdrawal symptoms start.\nRichard War ing Paul Ekpenyong\nLindisfame and Sundance.\nAfter the usual half hour\ndelay in starting, the support\nband 'Sundance' began their set\nwith 'Meet You In My Dreams'.\nThey were one of the better\nsupport bands starting of well and producing a fairly reasonable noise with odd patches of\ngood guitar. But Inevitably,\nthey soon slid into a dreary\nrepetitive sound Incorporating\nthe most monotonous drumming\nthat did less than justice to a tangible evidence of the\nexistence of Rag. The .above\narguments are false because\nRag is a social as well as a fund-raising event and also it is perfectly possible to sell all of\nthem. Rag is\" social in the sense\nthat through it a great number of\npeople get to know each other\nin the first few weeks of term\nand it provides harmless fun for\nmost of the 'first 2 terms. The\nmain reason for large numbers\nof Rag Mag being unsold is\nunwillingness by the people at\nthe top to take on the extra\nvery good attempt at ^integrated'\norgan/guitar playing.\" The main attraction i of the\nevening, 'Llndisfarne', came on\nafter an intermission of approximately fifteen minutes. They\nkicked off with a song entitled\n\u2022Stephen Wolf from the 'Roll\nOn Ruby' album followed by\n'North Country Boy' from the\nsame album. They then performed two songs 'You Put The\nLaff On Me', 'a comedy song',\nand 'In Your Head' both taken\nfrom their new album 'Happy\nDaze'.\nwork involved in accounting\nfor them.\niI think that the general\nfeeling in college is that we\nwant aRag Mag, so please tell\nyour VP and we will try to get\nthis decision changed.\nYours sincerely,\nM.F.

The request for one\nmonth's rent in advance and a deposit of not less than one\nmonth's rent is usually required\nand is accepted in view of the\nroom and facilities and seems\nmore than fair.\nAfter a few weeks niggling\nincidents occur and in many\ncases major h arras s ment which\neither drives the student out or\na direct notice to quit is issued.

These\nsharks know that very few\nstudents can take expensive\nlegal action and after a long\ncorrespondence the matter is dropped and the people letting\ncan start all over again, if they\nhave not already done so.

However, a few\nweeks later there was an\nalmighty violent altercation \u2014\nSHARKS\nbeen taken for a 'ride' when\nlarge flat already occupied by\nbeating up, glasses and furniture\nbeing smashed; if murder had taken place it would not have\nbeen surprising. Next day I moved out and resided with a friend.\nNumerous letters were sent\nrequesting the return of the\n\u00a320.00 deposit, this they then\nreferred to as 'key money' and\nthis I am given to understand is illegal. In any case they held one week's money for which I received nothing. I asked a 'Local Advice Centre' to write\non my behalf and he agreed that\ntheir action constituted h arras s ment.

Two days\nCont'd on back page\nPRESSURE\n'SENNET IS substantially diverting advertising revenue\nfrom most of the London Student Newspapers by claiming the\nludicrously high figure of 100,000 as its readership'.\nThat was the message that\ncame over loud and clear from\nthe third meeting of the London Student Newspaper Executives held at Imperial College last Saturday. Nearly all the representatives at the meeting\ntold of how the vast majority of\nthe Sennets arriving at their\nUnions are never read.\nSome quoted instances where\nSennet had been asked to send\nfewer copies but the request\nhad been ignored. The consequent suggestion was that\nSennet might be trying to\npreserve its circulation claim. Replying to that particular\ncriticism, Jeremy Clift, the\nExecutive Editor of , Sennat\nstated that this was purely a misunderstanding based on a lack of lias on. On the\u00bb point of\nthe circulation figure, he stated\nthat 40,000 copies of Sennet\nwere printed each week and that it is estimated that an average of 2.5 people read each\ncopy. The figure of2.5 is used\nby national newspapers to\nFELIX wishes to point out that it in no way intended to\nprejudice the second reading of the proposed constitutional\nchange that the PG Affairs Officer should be a member of\nthe Union Executive. We therefore wish to clarify the\nfollowing points: Firstly all constitutional changes require\nto be passed by two UGMs. These two UGMs must be held\nmore than 28 and less than 40 college days apart. Thus for\nthe PGA O to join the Exec, requires the motion to be passed\nat a second UGM.\nSecondly, whilst the gathering at the meeting did not\nconstitute a quorum, the meeting was quo rate until the quorum\nwas challenged.\nThe actual motion has been proposed by the PGA O himself\non a mandate from the PG group in IC.\nestimate their circulation. Further discussion on advertising brought forth from\nSennet's assistant advertising\nmanager remarks such as 'you're being too honest' and 'you are approaching advertising\ntoo fairly and squarely'. This did not appear to go down very\nwell with the rest of the\nmeeting, several of whom fall\nunder a mandate from their\nunion and act on their union's behalf.\nThe meeting, which lasted about five hours also criticised the NUS Press Office for the\nseemingly abysmal service that\nit gives. Francis Beckett, the\nNUS Press Officer, explained to\nthe meeting the difficulties and\nproblems associated with\nrunning the press office. It\nappears that one of the biggest\nproblems is the inflexibility of\nthe NUS administration when it comes to sending out press\nreleases at short notice.\nMr. Beckett outlined some\nideas which he intends to\npropose to NUS which, in his view, would improve the Press Service.\nThe final item on the agenda\nwas the idea of an advertising\nagency which could be run by\nstudents on behalf of the\nLondon student newspapers.\nThe idea has been through a successful pilot scheme for\nhandbooks and the natural\nextension is that it could work\nfor newspapers. It was felt that\nsuch an agency might prove to\nbe the solution to the Sennet\nproblem.\n\n"
