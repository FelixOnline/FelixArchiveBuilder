    "content": "LETTERS Dear Colin\nYou may be interested to\nhear about an incident which\noccurred at about 1:20pm on\nMonday 25th February when\nMartin Symonds a first year\nstudent in the department of\ncomputing saw two youths\nloitering at the rear of the\nHuxley Building where a large\nnumber of pedal cycles are\nkept. Having had his own cycle\nstolen from there only a few\ndays previously he was naturally\nsuspicious and reported the\nmatter to us.\nTogether with Martin I spoke\nto the youths and brought\nthem back to my office for\nquestioning. Being diss a st is fie d with their answers I sent for\nthe police and whilst awaiting\ntheir arrival one of the youths\nattempted to escape through\nmy office window but was\nprevented from doing so by\nMartin who hung on to the\nyouth's legs as he hung head\nfirst through the window about\nten feet above ground level.\nIt subsequently transpires\nthat the youths intended to\nsteal a motor cycle and were in\npossession of implements for this\npurpose.\nI am passing this information\nto you for publication because\nthis is a classic example of the\nprompt passing of information\ncan prevent a crime being\ncommitted. We hope Martin's example will be followed by\nothers and we urge students and\nstaff to contact us as quickly as\npossible whenever they see\nanything suspicious.\nThere is a sequel to this\nincident. Two days afterwards\nMartin was walking down Gloucester Road, when he saw a pedal cycle chained to the\nrailings which he recognised as\nbeing one which was stolen some\ndays earlier from one of his\ncolleagues. A telephone message\nto Kensington Police and the\nstolen machine was restored to\nits rightful owner.\nCrime prevention is every-body's business.\nYours sincerely\nAD Dawson\nChief Security Officer\nDear Sir\nI see that two hundred sheets\nof A4 paper is now 99p in the IC\nBookshop. Since it only costs\n69p in Unimart, this means that\neither Unimart are making a loss\nor the IC Bookshop is profiteering. Any comments?\nYours faithfully\nMichael Hartz\nElec Eng 3\nDear Colin/Roger\nCan you kindly correct the\nerror in my last article (issue\n546): the word is ALLAH not\nALI TAH and I inserted the dash\nas a pause exists there.\nYours\nY El-s a ie' Islamic Soc\nDear Roger\nMonday's Finniston events\nrepresented an unusual opportunity for everyone here at\nImperial College to discuss the\nfuture of engineering with those\nwho endeavour to change it. Sir\nMonty himself defended the\n\u2022 relevance and importance of his\ncommittee's report to students\nhere. It is this point that merits\nlaboring: the Finniston Report is\nrelevant to everyone who hopes\nto work in British industry and no\none can afford to ignore it now.\nThe future of every IC student\nhangs in balance \u2014 the accelerating economic decline of\nthe last fifteen years rests\nprecariously by the point of no\nreturn. Sir Monty is campaigning\nto swing the balance back in\nBritain's and, thus your, favour.\nHis grim forecasts ;and complex\nsolution is of vital importance to\nevery reader of this letter \u2014\nYOU are the future leaders of\n\"Britis h Industry \u2014 his dire\nprophecy is YOUR dire prophecy. It is thus your responsibility to turn your attention Jo what Sir Monty is telling you.\nThe Finniston Report proposes\nto change engineering, industry,\nand engineering education in\nBritain today \u2014 all these affect-you and the significance of these\nchanges leave you no alternative\nbut to explore them. Heed the\nadvice of the Rector at Monday\nnight's panel discussion and take\nthe time to read the report. Find\nout about its indirect and direct\"\neffects on you (your department\nmay have already begun exploring a course of change) and\nformulate a knowledgeable\nopinion.\nBritain today is at a crossroads\nand Finniston is pointing the way\nahead. Don't let Sir Monty be a modern day Cassandra \u2014 listen,\nthink, and ACT \u2014 before it's too\nlate.\nSincerely\nRick Woldenberg\nChem Eng 2\nDear Sir\nI have noticed my name\nappearing along the walkway in\nconnection with the sabbatical\nelections. I am not, to my\nknowledge, standing for election.\nYours faithfully\nRavel\nDear FELIX Editor\nWe would like it to be known\nthat Henry Curwen (ME3) is the\nPedal Car Manager for City and\nGuilds College Union. Not only\nis he the manager, he is also the\nmechanic and has done all the\nmaintenance work on our pedal\ncars. Without his enthusiasm\nand help, we would not now have\nso many people interested in\npedalling and in the Bristol\nTwenty-four Hour Pedal Car\nRace. We had a great achievement at Bristol this year and this\nwould not have been possible\nwithout Henry being available at\nall times to complete repairs.\nTherefore we would like to\nexpress our gratitude to Henry\nfor all his work and encourage-ment. Thanks.\nSigned by the whole of the\nC& GU pedal car team.\nDear Colin\nIn amongst all the argument\nconcerning the apartheid issue,\nmany people are missing the\nlesson of the EG M, ie, why\nwasn't it possible to obtain a quorum, despite such important\nmotions( issues which the\nsignatories of the petition, myself\nincluded, obviously thought\nimportant enough to require the\nEG M in the first place). Are there\njust not three hundred or so\npeople in the college who think*\nJhar Apartheid, NUS, etc, are\nimportant, I think not. Are the\nmeetings badly publicised, or are\nthey%ta bad time? I think that\nthe answer to the first question\nmust be an emphatic \" no!\", you'd have togo around IC blind,\nand deaf not to hear about it.\nHowever, I think that it is\nunfortunate that the meetings\nclash with Associated Studies\nactivities (which are deemed\nimportant enough to attempt to\nmake sure that tutorials could\nbe arranged for other times).\nWouldn't Monday lunchtime be\nbetter? Also, perhaps Exec News could be released on Friday, so that would-be participants would be aware of what\nthey were going to discuss in\nmore detail (or even have it\nincluded in FELTX). I sincerely\nhope that another opportunity\nwill arise to discuss the Boat\nClub tour to South Africa. I feel\nthat every opportunity should be\ntaken to put pressure on that\ngovernment, even if to some\npeople the Boat Club might seem\npretty small fry. Perhaps these\npeople might feel differently if\nthey had to work in cities miles\naway from their families, seeing\nthem perhaps once a month, and\ncouldn't use many of the 'Whites\nOnly' amenities in the cities built\nby their own sweated labour.\nThere have been recent reforms,\nbut these have been mere\nwindow dressing, and pressure\nmust be continued to bring about\nreal reform and end apartheid.\nYours sincerely\nLee Paddon\nPhysics 1\nDear Sir\nTwo items in last week's FELIX (no 546) have aroused\nmy wrath. Firstly, isn't it about,\ntime someone somewhere in\nthe Union actually decided on\na policy regarding sport and\nthen stuck to it. At the moment,\nat the slightest hint of a boycott\nof the Olympics there is a cry of\n\" keep sport out of politics\",\nwhilst mention South Africa and\nthere is horror at the thought of\nlinks. Come on, play fair. If you\nboycott South Africa for its\noppression of the blacks, then\nyou must also boycott Russia for\nits oppression of just about\neveryone it can lay its hands on. Or is it a case that the people\nmaking the noise know which\nside their bread is buttered on?\nSecondly, how the hell can\nFELTX criticise London Student\nfor missing out one word, a mistake that, I am told, was\nmade at the printers when we get\n. . . \"advising the rowing eight to\ngo under a different dame.\" and\n\"Last week he came face to face\nwith a moral dilemma; he talked\nto Roger Stotesbury...\" both on\nthe front page and, referring to\nthe Soccer Sixes \". . . eighteen\nteams entered for the tournament (a total of one hundred and\neighty players).\" on the back\npage.\nYours faithfully\nRJ Glass\nME2\nPS: I notice that Paul Segal of\nLondon Student wished to\ncommit suicide at IC. Since\nsuicide is the termination of life\nsurely everyone at Stalag Imperial is somewhat suicidal?\nThere certainly isn't much 'life'\nhere.\nACTING ED'S COMMENT: Motions to a Union General\nMeeting are prepared and\nsubmitted by individuals. Is it\ntherefore not surprising that\nmotions, tabled, such as you\ndescribe above, conflict in\nopinion and attitude? On this\nissue, however, Union policy is\nquite clear and was printed in\nFELIX last week.\nHaving invited letters on the\nsubject of 'Sport And South\nAfrica' I was surprised by the\ntotal lack of response.\n2\n\n"

The Editor is responsible\nfor the production and printing of FELIX. Only Lars has worked on FELIX throughout\nthe year; he fully understands each stage of\nthe production and can work to a tight\nschedule.\nThe Editor must keep people interested and\ninvolved and must organise the day-to-day\nrunning of the print unit; Lars has beer\nchairman of the FELIX committee and ICL Publicity Officer as well as being on\nPublications Board and Iam sure will do this\nextremely well.

That way every copy of FELIX can be folded and collated on Thursday\nevening.\nSecondly, I 'll introduce the variety to FELIX to make it a newspaper you'll want to read\nfrom beginning to end. That includes a concise, relevant and regular editorial which\nI firmly believe is essential to the paper.\nIf you want printing work done by the Union print unit, you will know exactly what is\navailable and get reasonable deadlines \u2014 if\nyou're not satisfied, it won't be for lack of\ntrying. The future of FELIX depends on the\nelection of a responsible, imaginative and\nefficient editor and that is what I shall be.\nLars Wernberg-Moller\nCANDIDATE: Paul Williams\nPROPOSER: Harvey Nadin\nimproved his skills by hard work and dedication, and has now attained the\nstandards that professions als seek.\nPaul has the in it it at ive and flair, plus dedication and skill to turn FELIX Into an\nattractive and award-winning paper.

At the end of this\nyear he produced a cartoon book.\nAs a second year he still contributed to\nFELIX and also took on the editorship of\nthe Rag Mag and the RCS Handbook.

    "content": "RAG CABER TOSSING\nIf you read the Kensington News And\nPost last Friday, you may have seen a letter\nfrom the National Deaf Children's Society,\nwhich said, \" We have been very thrilled by\nthe enthusiasm and hard work of the students at Imperial College, in their efforts\nto help deaf children.\"\nThe rest of the letter went on to ask for\nsponsorship for the children taking part in\nour C ABER TOSSING CONTEST, which\ntakes place tomorrow, Saturday8 th March in Prince's Gardens. If you've been one of the ones contributing the \"enthusiasm and hard work\" mentioned, the nIas sure you from experience, that it makes it all worthwhile\nwhen' you meet the children you are helping. If you haven't been involved in\nRag yet, then I urge you to come along\nand really see what we are doing \u2014\ntomorrow we are having about fifty deaf\nchildren from schools which we will be\nbuying equipment for, plus their parents,\nteachers and officers of the National Deaf\nChildren's Society, if you want to ask any\nquestions 'about deafness, the equipment\nwe're buying, etc.\nThis event is designed to be a great day\nout for the kids, and for YOU to get\ninvolved. There' slots of highland demonstrations, games, fun, jelly and ice-cream, and the national press should be\nthere too. So please come along \u2014 either\nto the event itself at 2:00pm or if you\nwant to help we'll be around Prince's Gardens/Southside Lower Dining Room from 10:00am. BE THERE \u2014 it'll be great\nfun and give you immense satisfaction if\nyou've done anything for Rag this year.\nRae PG TIPS\nOf the various matters discussed at\nmeeting of the Graduate Committee on\n3rd March, I should like to bring the\nfollowing to the attention of PG students.\nOVERSEAS RESEARCH STUDENTS FEES SUPPORT SCHEME\nThis is a scheme that would be\napplicable only from the coming academic year and has been set up by\nthe Secretary of State for Education\nand Science to provide awards for\npartial remission of tuition fees (to the\nextent of the difference between overseas and home students' fees) to\noverseas research students of \" out standing merit and research potential\".\nThere will be a total of about five\nhundred such awards of which IC is\nexpected to get a share of about sixty.\nAt present the rate of in take of\noverseas research students at IC is\nabout one hundred and twenty per year\non average. Since this trend is likely to\ndecline over time, it would seem that\nmore than half the overseas research\nstudents joining IC In 1980-81 would\nbe able to take advantage of this\nscheme. The awards would initially be\nmade for a. period of one academic\nyear, but are ext eni ble for the full\ncourse of study of the student.\nSUPERVISION OF RESEARCH\nSTUDENTS\nThe committee also discussed some\nquestions relating to protracted periods of research in the case of PhD students.\nIt was generally agreed that while\nthree to four years was the 'normal'\ntime to finish a PhD, if students were\ntaking more time then there wer^e reasons to look deeper into this phenomenon. The Registrar has agreed to collect some information\nrelating to PhD students who have\nbeen registered as full-time students\nfor more than four years.\nOne often hears complaints about\nresearch students not getting adequate\nsupervision either because of some personal problems with their supervisors or because the supervisor has\nfar too many students to supervise or\nbecause some supervisors take up so\nmuch consultancy work that they have\nvirtually no time left for their research\nstudents. In this connection, Richard\nEarl, my predecessor, had tried to\nconduct a survey which among other\nthings, asked the PG s whether they\nthought they were getting adequate\nsupervision. Unfortunately, the response rate of this survey was so low\nthat the only thing that came out\nunequivocally was the general apathy\nof the PG s to such efforts.\nHowever, even if this problem affects only a very small proportion of\nresearch students, it still needs to be\nJooked into in detail. The Chairman of\nIthe Graduate Studies Committee has\nkindly agreed to write a letter to heads\nof departments to find out about research students in their departments\nwho are taking more than four years\nfor their PhD and also to find out the\npossibility of allot ing an additional staff advisor/alternate supervisor or\nhaving aPG tutor/an advisory body in\neach department to whom the research\nstudents could go and talk about problems of supervision. Some departments already have such a provision. In\nany case, I think this is a positive step\nand must be commended. If you have\nany other ideas that could help, come\nand see me or drop a line and I will come\nand see you.\nNEW MSc COURSE IN NUCLEAR\nFUEL TECHNOLOGY\nThe department of Chemical Engineering is going to run this PG course from October1980. It is a substitute for an earlier course and\nhas been approved by the Graduate\nStudies Committee. It would be put\nbefore the Engineering Board on 5th March and in all probability would be\ngiven a go ahead.\nThe reason why I bring this to your\nnotice is because after having looked\nat the proposed syllabus of the course, I, personally, think that the\nsafety and environmental impact aspects of nuclear fuel technology have not got sufficient attention. At\npresent less than about ten percent of\nthe lectures seem to be devoted to\nthese aspects.\nMost of the graduates from this course, according to the notes before\nthe Graduate Studies Committee, would be employed by British Nuclear\nFuels Ltd (BNFL) and other nuclear\npower companies like NPC, GEC, etc.\nThe B NFL also hope to send some of\ntheir staff members for this course.\nThis course at IC must give a balanced\npicture of the hazardous aspects of\nnuclear energy \u2014 particularly when\ninstitutions like the B NFL do not have\na clean record of matters relating to\nsafety (see for example, (i) Science for\nPeople, page five, Autumn 1978, and\n(ii) Counter Information Service AntiReport Number 22, pages twenty-one\nto twenty-nine).\nWhile individuals should perhaps be\nfree to choose whether they want\nnuclear energy or not, students such\nas those who would graduate from\nthis course must have a fair picture of\nall aspects of nuclear energy. Their\nresponsibility becomes all the more\ncrucial considering that people who\nare most susceptible to nuclear hazards are those who are also the\nmost vulnerable sections of the\npopulation and have had no direct sav\nin choosing nuclear energy, ie the\ncommon man/woman and more import ant ly, the industrial workers in\nnuclear plants.\nLastly, those of you who would like\nany Union help in solving any of your\nspecific problems are welcome to get\nin touch with me.\nBharat Bhushan\nPG Affairs Officer\n11\n\n"

SORRY. Many people have expressed their concern at my standing for this post. They seem to think that Iam somehow\nnot suited to the job. Well, Iam telling\nyou now that I have the experience, the\nenthusiasm, the conviction, the A levels,\nand everything else which the winning\ncandidate will need if he is to run a successful and fruitful Union next year.\nWhen I say I have the experience Iam referring to the fact that for one a half a years now I have sat on the R CSU general\ncommittee, gaining a very thorough knowledge of how committees function, and\nindeed how presidents function.\nBoth Chris Fox and Mary Attenborough\n(last year's ICU President) I consider to be\nideal people on whom to model myself, and I have spent many hours delving into what,\nmade a truly great President. I have not yet\nmanaged to cultivate a beer gut, nor have I managed to cultivate breasts, but I feel that\nwith my dynamic enthusiasm these will\ncome, with time. Indeed what sort of a President is he without something standing\nout. Iam no exception. There you have it: you don't get a chance\nvote for King, President, Rector, etc, so use\nthis opportunity wisely. Choose the sort of\nperson you want to be up there, representing your views.

CANDIDATE: John Passmore\nPROPOSER: Pat Leggett\nThe next two years will be two of the \u2022\nmost important years for both the Union and College. The budget will be cut by\none million pounds each year for the next\nthree years and facilities like refectories\nand accommodation must become cost\neffective. The Union next year will be\nfin an aced on a per capita basis, but in the\nfollowing year will return to sub vent ion thus reducing the grant.\nSo that the Union may maintain its\npresent facilities and equipment, next year's President must be a person who is\nexperienced in Union and College related\nmatters and must have the ability to lead\nand coordinate the Union so that the\nfacilities are used to the utmost.\nI have been involved in ICU since my first\nyear and am at present External Affairs\nOfficer and sit on UL US CR Executive. Iam also active on various commit tess: Refectories,' Overseas Student, Vacation\nTraining and University of London Accommodation Committee. These show\nthat I have the experience in Union and\nCollege matters to do the job effectively.\nHave I the ability? On External Affairs\nCommittee, I have led, motivated and coordinated the activities of External Affairs to produce motions on many issues, attend conferences and report on\nthem, and to produce an excellent grants\npaper being studied by Rhodes Boys on. Also, this year has proved to be the best\nyear for many for ICU within UL U. Next year, I aim to campaign mainly on\nrefectories, welfare( including ac como dati on) and lecturer training. I will not\nmake rash election promises to become\nPresident, but I have the ability and the\nexperience to work for the students of\nthis Union, to maintain its present active\nstatus in clubs and societies and academic\nmatters and to set a standard which can be maintained in future years.\nJohn Passmore CANDIDATE: Mick Berry\nPROPOSER: Mo Misra\nWho is Mick Berry?

    "content": "SPORT HOCKEY\nTwo major surprises awaited the\nsecond eleven players as we turned up\non Saturday lunchtime. The first was\nthat twelve of us had actually turned\nup so we could field a full team and\nan umpire. The second was the unbelievably dazzling whiteness of\nGordon Baxter' s shoes which left\nseveral team members groping for\nsri ow goggles and could well explain\nthe apparent blindness of our opposition's umpire!\nWhen Dave Cornwell volunteered to\numpire the first half, the outlook seemed\nvery bleak indeed. This was confirmed\nas our opponents dominated the first\npart of the match. Despite good defensive work by Steve Rampton, and\nSteve Leinster, Uxbridge finally managed to score about twenty minutes\ninto the half. Soon after this, Martin\n'Banks' Cooper demonstrated a revolutionary new goal keeping tactic when\nhe somehow managed to get his pads\nbetween an attacker's stick and the ball,\n^preventing a certain goal.\nThe second half saw persistent College pressure inspired by Mike Chew\nin midfield, strong forward running and\nPete Smith's constant shouts of 'Keep it\ntight'. We managed to stretch the\nUxbridge defence but unfortunately\ncould not find the final shot. In attack,\nUxbridge were frustrated by the close\nattention and sharp tackles of Gordon\nBaxter and Andy Stroomer and apart\nfrom several moments of blind panic\nwere unable to cause Martin Cooper any\ntrouble.\nAfter the game, we got revenge for' our defeat by directing Pete Smith's rendition of 'Puppy Love' towards the\nvisitors' changing rooms! Obviously\ndistressed by this horrible torture, our\nopponents left without accepting their\njug. This left us with little alternative\nbut to take up the spoils of victory!\nAndy Stroomer\nRUGBY On Sunday 2nd March, IC took part in\na XV a side tournament held at the\nCivil Service ground in Chiswick. Four\nteams took part, Civil Service, IC\nWageningen (from Holland) and the\nLemmings a team from South Kensington Museums.\nThe competition was organised on a league basis with each team playing\nthree games. The first rounds saw the\nCivil Service convincingly beat Wage ning en204 while IC took on the\nLemmings, and labour ed in getting on\ntop of this motley crew and at half-time\nthe score was still 0-0 despite great vocal\nsupport from a merry band of sup-porters. Second half points from a Dunleavy penalty and Price-Stevens\ntry gave the crowd something to cheer\nabout, enthusiasts cheering after IC's second try was soon muted, when it\nwas realised that Goring was the\nscorer, giving a final score of 11-0.\nIn the second round the luckless Dutch were beaten 12-4 by the Lemmings, and IC encountered their hardest game agin st Civil Service. The Government representatives were obviously taking things very seriously\nand after several fracas during the first\nhalf the referee saw it necessary to\nsend both teams off the field to lecture\nthe captains. On the resumption, the\nCivil Service potted three penalties to\ncome out 9-0 victors, may I add that\nour behaviour was exe mpl or y, and. being civil servants our opponents hit\nout in triplicate.( Robin Ringer Moorgate-Davies is innocent \u2014 maybe).\nIn the final round the Civil Service\nwere held to 4-0 by the Lemmings but\nstill took the tournament, and IC took\non Wage ning en. It soon became apparent that no matter how we tried\nit was going to be difficult to let our\nDutch friends score, so we went on to\ngive them a veritable drab bing of 34-0,\ntries coming from Will Burgoyne (2),\nPhil Ratcliffe (2), Pat Dunleavy and\nSteve Townsend. This game was played in a friendly spirit and everyone who was there, is looking forward\nto the IC RFC tour to Holland when\nWageningen will be our hosts.\nP Goring\nSOCCER IC were again to make changes to\ntheir regular line up for Saturday's game against St Thomas'. Que nt Merritt continued in place of Graham\nRick ard with Andy Hartland joining him in the forward line. For the absent\nDean the defence had been pruned of\nboth full backs so that Jim Beer was\nbrought in at left back. At right back\nwe had Dennis Cook, who must have\nbeen inspired by Seb Coe's appearance in the Hyde Park Relay, as he\nspent most of the game at speed approaching MACH2! IC were just getting into their stride\nwhen St Thomas' s were presented with a goal. However, IC fought back\nwell, so well that Chris He nd y got\nbooked and equalise d, just, from boof ted and~equal is Bd7~ ju\u00abtr~f Tom Stevenson's penalty. After Hendy was'\nfouled. St Thomas's began to flag and\nwhen Rowley's cannon ball shot was\ndropped by the keeper, Hartland was\non hand to hit two shots at defenders\nbefore Merritt arrived to finish the job\nproperly! At 2-1, their heads were\n- down and a superb goal at the start of\nthe second half sealed it. Hartland made a superb run past three defenders\nto the goal line and, as the keeper came\nto him, he crossed so precisely that even\nthe horizontal Rowley couldn't miss!\nTen minutes from the end, Hendy was\ninvolved in a collision that led to. concussion, but soldiered on for all of\ntwo minutes before* being led off not\nknowing where he was! After this St\nThomas's revived but IC clung to their\nguns to finish up 3-1 winners.\nHendy survived the dreaded St John's ambulance man and arrived in the\nshowers. He declined an offer to write\nthe match report, as he was suffering\nfrom amnesia! He found it hard to\nbelieve he had been booked and refused\nto believe Haralampous had got a hat\ntrick r Chris was last seen in the capable .\nhands of his nurse, Jill, who will no\ndoubt jog his memory about the important things in life!\nTeam: S Veats, D Cook, J Beer, M Kenrick, K Reeve, C Hendy, A Haral am po us,I Stevenson, J Rowley, A Hartland and Q Merritt.\nIC took the field against Chelsea determined to wipe out their two\nprevious dismal displays. This seemed a likely event as Chelsea had got a single\npoint so far this season! IC's flagging\nmorale was further boosted when Chelsea's captain suggested playing for\nthe points from a previously postponed\nfixture to make the match worth four\npoints.\nThe side showed two changes from\ni the regular side, Hendy being moved to\nfull back with third team star Mart\nArmstrong taking his midfield place and\nQuent Merritt de put ising for superstar\nRickard.\nThe game itself memorable for being\nforgettable! The result was 6-0. Only two\nincidents stand out in the match. In the\nfirst half the never dependable Reeve\nproduced such a perfectly weighted\nback pass that the ball, a Chelsea forward and Steve Vf fats r arrived simultaneously at the edge of the box!\nThe result was Veats going for the ball,\nthe forward getting Veats in the rib cage\n(nothing like Chris Hendy's cage!) and\nthe ball shooting off vaguely goal wards. Kenrick cleaned up the ball while Reeve\ntried to clear up the pile of arms and legs\nthat once passed for IC's goalkeeper!\nFortunately Veats was able to continue,\nthus saving ICfrom having their'reserve'\ngoalkeeper, Reeve, in goal again!\nThe second incident began in the\nsecond half when Haralampous took a throw-in to Dean, who controlled and\nturned beautifully. On looking up he\nsaw a red streak burning down the\ncentre of the pitch and couldn't help\nhimself from hitting the ball towards it.\nThe ball rich o ce ted off the 'object' for a very good goal. Just as Dave was\nclaiming it, we noticed a multitude of\nnoise and arm waving from the now\ndecelerating flash and realised that it\nwas, in fact, 'kinky' Kenrick, who had\nactually achieved his season long ambition to score . . . a goal! This was\ngoal six, the other five coming from\nStevenson, Rowley, and Dean.\nTeam: S Veats, C Hendy, M Curran, M Ken rick,K Reeve, M Armstrong, A Haralampous, I Stevenson, J Rowley, D Dean, Q Merritt.\n15\n\n"

    "content": "REVIEW SINO CRISPS, NO FUN The fact that IC students are generally\napathetic toward live entertainment at the\ncollege has been apparent for sometime.\nThis, couple with the fact that Sunday\nnights gig was not advertised outside\nCollege, paved the way for yet another\ncalculated flop.\nAbout two hundred paying punters\nbraved the clinical confines of the Great\nHall in order to wat cn The Smirks and\nThe Charlie Parkas. The Smirks made a legitimate attempt to rouse the small but\nenthusiastic attendance with a set that\nowed more to youthful enthusiasm than\nto startling musical prowess. Still, they\nwere well received, and considering the\nsterile atmosphere of their platform,\nmanaged to evoke a warm response.\nThe Charlie Parkas, (aka the Albertos)\nas if ffe c ted by their surroundings, gave\nwhat, by their standards, was a lack\nlustre performance. 'Going through the\nmotions' I think you could have called it.\nNot bothering with the theatrical props\nthat are usually such a feature of their\nact, instead they meandered lamely\nthrough a bunch of limp songs, the only\nreal humour coming in the preambles.\nAfter about forty minutes, this writer,\nsuffering from acute boredom decided to\nlook for edible refreshment. On my return\nsome five minutes later, I was refused\nread mission, by a self-styled security man\n(bouncer to you), my crime being that I was armed with two packets of potato\ncrisps (for the interested reader one was\nready salted and the other was beef 'n' onion) crisps I was told, were not allowed\nin the auditorium. I faced a dilemma: was\nI to sacrifice the crisps in the name of\nrock ' n' roll, or reach B unter esque proportions and scoff the lot? I ate the\ncrisps, the band played on.\n\"P... off photographer - I'm gonna hide.\nSmirks pic by Nigel Tooby.\nWE CANT PAY? WE WONT PAY! \u2014 a satirical farce.\n\"We Can't Pay? We Won't Pay!\"\nwill be performed in the Union\nConcert Hall each night from\nTuesday 11th March to Saturday\n15th. Each performance will begin\nat 7:30pm, and tickets are priced\nat \u00a31.00.\nHow would you react if, on your next\ntrip to Waitrose, you discovered that all\ntheir prices had doubled overnight?\nWould you simply accept the situation, or\nwould the rise be just too much?\nDario Fo, in this much acclaimed farce,\ngives his own opinion of how two\"\neveryday Italian couples might have acted\nin the Communist Party era of the\nseventies. The country gripped by raging\ninflation, our characters' emotions run\nhigh, to the point where they feel they\ncan justify what they once thought to be\ncriminal acts.*.\nThe play is certainly a comedy, but\nasks many serious questions about the\nmorals of capitalists, communists, the\ntrade unions, police farces, and indeed sill\nwho wield power. Apparently, the only\nway in which the individual can fiqh t rights is to take the law into his own\nhands\n\"We Can't Pay? We Won't Pay!\" was\nfirst performed in this country at the Half\nMoon Theatre in 1978, and the Imperial\nCollege Dramatic Society's production\nwill be its second revival. Dario Fo's work\nis not well known in Britian, although he\nis highly successful in his own country.\nAnother of his farces \" The Accidental\nDeath Of An Anarchist\" is currently\nplaying at Wyndhams in the West End.\nMark Wiszowaty\n9\n\n"

THURSDAY 20th MARCH HANG GLIDING CLUB MEETING at\n12:45pm in Mech Eng 342.\nHE A THAT IMPERIAL\nTuesday saw the return of a packed\nLecture Theatre, with Edward Heath\nspeaking to an audience of about three\nhundred and fifty in Physics Lecture\nTheatre One. This was a great follow up\nto the Finniston lecture on the day\nbefore. Mr Heath is a Conservative ex-Prime Minister, and is at present MP for'\nBexley and Sidcup. Mr Heath spoke at\ngreat length on the future economic\npolicy of the world, and directly tied up\nthe problems facing Third World developing\ncountries and the developed countries.\nThe audience was first informed of the\npast global economic policy which led to\nthirty yu ears of prosperity following the\nSedond World War. The policy of the US lending money to European countries so\nthat these countries could rebuild their\nindustries, knowing that Europe would have\nto use US industries and technical knowledge if technology was to return to\nEurope.\nThe future of Britain relies on us helping\nto extend this principle in the next twenty\nyears. However, the role that we must play\nhas changed. Europe has to rely on OPEC countries investing their oil profits in other\nThird World countries. Investment in these\ncountries would result in a demand for\ntechnical expertise from countries in the\nNorth (ie, America, Canada, Australasia,\nand European countries). This would help\nto ease the problems of unemployment\nwhich we presently face.\nWe can no longer rely on our traditional\nindustries, eg, motor industry to support\nour economy. Instead we must fully develop\nnew industries and new technology, eg, the\nsilicon chip industry. Thus we cannot\nremain stationary in terms of technological\nadvance, but must be constantly breaking\nnew technological barriers. However this\nrelies on developed countries being able to\ncome to some agreement with OPEC countries as to the future of oil supplies and\noil prices, as without this agreement future\ninvestment will be difficult if not impossible.\nAfter his speech, Mr Heath then\nanswered questions from the floor. Most of\nthe questions were on the subject of\noverseas development. The first was raised\non the position and status of Iron\nCurtain countries in this global strategy.\nThe principle of industrial cooperation\nwithout political guarantees was accepted\nwhilst noting that we have alot to answer for\nin this held. We must no longer consider the\nsituation as being one of 'aid', but as one of\n\u2022 'mutual cooperation'. In conclusion most\npeople came away feeling that they had\nlearnt a great deal on future global policy,\nfrom a man who must be recognised as an\nexpert in this field.\nBernard Smith\n\n"

I would ensure that our capita tion fee is\nlarge enough to take advantage of this\nchange.\nThe Union owns, through RC C and ACC, four vans and two land rovers which currently are a shameful drain on\nour resources. The answer is to have a Union transport service, with a committee\nand the ability to do what is needed.\nThe safety of women, when there are unwanted, uninvited people around is\ndesperately important and I would do all I could to prevent any nasty incidents.\nCANDIDATE: Rac Sncc\nPROPOSER: Pete Bamford\nThe Deputy President's job involves all\nthe services affecting students.

His view was\nthat Plaid Cymru will become a more\nsocialist party.\nQuestioners from the audience asked\nmainly why he did not think an all-British\ncampaign for socialism would be\nfavourable to a Welsh socialist state,\nwhich he answered by saying that he did\nnot think any London based party or\nstate could ever be truly socialist, and\nthat there was a widespread and deeply\nfelt sense of national identity in Wales,\nalthough he did not see why an\nindependent Wales should weaken\nBritish trade union solidarity.\nThe outlook for Wales, he said, was\nbleak, with a possible fifty percent\nincrease in the jobless total ahead. He\nspoke of recent political developments\nincluding the formation of a Welsh Socialist Republican Movement in the\nwake of the Devolution fiasco, drawing\nits members from most Welsh political\nparties. He also spoke of a labour\nparty/ trade union attempt tore float the issue of Welsh home rule.\nPhWp\nICCA G Well, I think it must be mentioned\nthat last Friday we had a very enjoyable\ntime with the Birkenhead school children and though there was no real\nneed for volunteers to help out as we\nhad enough there is a need for you to\nsuggest other groups of kids we can\ntake out! Again Monday dinner times or Tuesdays at 5:30pm, third floor\nUnion Building.\nAs thoughts of summer enter our\nlittle heads we smile( before we\nremember exams) and if you know\ndefinitely that a sixteen week long\nholiday is going to bore you stiff then\nget away from it all. If like me you\nhave difficulty getting 'ordinary' jobs\nthen try voluntary work because everyone wants someone to help out\nfor little pay. Meanwhile you spend,\nsay, long hours in the gentle British\nsummer countryside at an old or\nyoung people's home, and if you are\nthe sort that gets worried easily by\nworld events these homes are mostly\nout of the major fallout zones so you\nonly get a natural suntan. Attracted?\nThe work, I say 'cos I know, is very\nvery easy.\nMeanwhile, back in the big gritty.\nWe still would like you to volunteer for\njust about anything you've spare time\nand inclination for. if you' re into stirring soup and chatting in Falmouth\nkitchens for an hour or so on Tuesday\nand Friday evenings then Sun ila' Nimalasuriya will show you how it's done and later at 10:30pm you may\neven feel like doing the soup run. PATA This term saw the birth of the Union's newest society, Imperial College Positive Alternatives To Abortion Society (PATA), following a long gestation and despite attempts by\nopponents to bring about a premature\nend to it.\nPATA exists to bring together students who believe that the 1967\nAbortion Act takes away the rights of\nthe unborn child. It intends to use all\nthe democratic means available to\ncampaign against the 1967 Act and\nthe Union's present policy on abortion.\nPATA is not just fighting abortion is m. It aims to persuade the Union to actively\nsupport the provision of better maternity\n- rights, to join campaign against cuts\nin nursery places and to support the\nprovision of facilities to allow more\nhandicapped people to have the\nopportunity of higher education.\nMembership of PATA is open to all\nstudents whatever their polit cal or\nreligious beliefs. If you are interested\nthen come to the next meeting on Wednesday 12th March at 1:00pm in\nChemistry Lecture Theatre E or contact\nSean Kelly, Chemistry 2.\n\n"

In race two, IC started\nwell and held on to finish first, second\nand sixth.\nThe third and deciding race proved\nto be the closest. On the penultimate\nleg of the course the positions were\nsecond, fourth and fifth, with IC\nneeding second, third and fourth to\nwin.\nCambridge made the mistake of\ncrossing the line in first position,\nleaving a three against two situation\non the final approach to the finish.\nClose covering resulted in the two\nremaining Cambridge boats being\ndropped to fifth and sixth, and so IC\nwon the race and the match.\nTeam: John Williams (Captain), Gil'\nButler, Nick Ajderian, Kevin Andrews,\nColin Murray, Caolan Patterson.\n15\n\n"

It was a In the evening, the Union staged an open discussion of\nspeech of authority, charm and wit, but through it showed his 'Educating Engineers Following Finniston'. Taking part were\nfears that the report would collect dust on some minister's Sir James Menter, FRS, Lord Flowers, Mr L Heard and Prof\nshelf. Brown.\nIC AND FINNISTON\nARE YOU FIT TO LEAD A DUSTMEN'S STRIKE?\nThe City and Guilds College Dean is\nchairing the College committee which will\nbe responding to the Finniston Report.\nOn Monday night he revealed his personal\nviews. Professor Brown said:\n\"I have sat down for ten hours with ten\nhighly intelligent colleagues to try to\nconsider how we reacted to the Finniston\nReport and we have agreed on six words\nwhich are \"We welcome the Finniston\nReport, but . . .\". There, roughly speaking,\nwe stick, because the things that we all fuss\nabout are quite different.\nWhat is the impact of all this on IC?\nFinniston proposes that there should be\nthree streams of engineers. At IC we are\nnot set up to educate the technicians, those\non the proposed R Eng (Assoc) courses. So\none of Finniston's stream is not our direct\neducation business. The other two streams\nare the graduate streams, the three year B Eng lot and the four year M Eng. Finniston\nproposes that twenty-five percent ought to\nbe the M Eng lot who are going to be the elite\nand the leaders of industry. One has to\npause and think about this twenty-five\npercent. About fifty percent of the\nengineering undergraduates are in poly s and it seems likely . . . that if this system is.\nset up M Eng courses will occur in a limited\nnumber of institut fons and pray to God they\nare universities, they may not be.\nMaking the simplifying assumption that\nthey are, fifty percent of the universities\nSir Monry Finniston\ngraduates now become M Eng fodder. In all\nmodesty . . . our students are among the\nbest in the country, we are able in all our\ndepartments to set a very high level of A level entry requirements and on the face of\nit, you would think, the whole of our intake\nought to be in the top fifty percent of the\nuniversity undergraduates in the country\nand so we ought to be able to say IC is an M Eng place.\nWhen we came to talk about this,\ndepartments reacted in different ways to it.\nCiv Eng has little hesitation to this . . . but\nother people were modest and said it's all\nvery well, but this twenty-five percent of the\ntotal . . . are supposed to be destined to be\nthe leaders of industry and XYZ in our\nsecond years are not fit to lead a dustman's strike. So we are not happy that all our\nintake . . . are really suited to be the leaders\nof industry.\nPeople then guessed as to the proportion\nof their students who were qualified.\"\nHe then explained the consequences of\nremoving students after the first year and\nreplacing them with new students who had\ninferior A level qualifications. He stated\n\"Maybe academic superiority is not the right\nkind of requirement for leadership in\nindustry.\" \"If so, an M Eng set up at IC\nstarts to look a little sick. Perhaps what we\nare looking for is personal qualities, and if so\nquite a lot of our intake hasn't got it! As\nessentially we choose them on an academic\nbasis even though all departments now\ninterview (we look for some spark of being\nalive) Finniston says it can't be done at that\nstage.\"\nHe went on to speak against the system\nby which both streams worked side by side.\nThe committee had agreed that entry\nrequirements would not be lowered at IC \u2014\ncontinuing at 3B's. He though there were no\nguidelines to the splitting of the first year\ninto two streams and felt it was a socially bad\nthing to create second class citizens.\" There\nare economic and terrible personal problems of this system\" he said.\nIMPORTANT NOTICE If you will be away from College on\nMonday and Tuesday you may vote in\nthe sabbatical elections TODAY, by\ngoing up to the Union Office.\nThe IC organised Hyde Park Relay was held last Saturday.

    "content": "AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL\nNEW DIRECTIONS?\nA number of IC students recently\nentered the world of economics, or at\nleast the London school of such to\nattend a meeting organised by Amnesty International. The meeting's purpose was to inform us of the latest\ndevelopments in Al's campaigns, and\nto give notice of short talks by people\nfrom Al, followed by discussion groups\non various topics.\nA speaker from the International\nsecretariat of Al talked about the\nchanging nature of Amnesty's cam-pai g ning, whereby it is now interested\nin the large scale abuse of human rights by a country, as well as the\ndetention of a given individual. This\nchange was brought about because in\nsome countries( Eth opi a, A min's Uganda) the adoption of a prisoner by\nAl was regarded as a death sentence.\nAn example of this new style is the\ncurrent campaign on Guatemala which\nis focused on the links between multinational companies and the government. For instance, it has been\nnoticed that there is a 'very high degree of correlation between a rise in\ndeath/disappearance rate of the local\npeasantry and the desire of International Nickel to start mining in that\nregion. Also for Guatemalan employees of Coca Cola, things just\ndon't go better with Coke.\nOn the USSR it was emphasised that Al has no policy on either the\nSoviet occupation of Afghanistan or\nthe holding of the Olympics in Moscow.\nHowever, it is still very concerned about\nthe continued regard for human rights\ndisplayed by the Soviet government.\nFuture campaigns will include action\non Zaire, Pakistan, export of 'repressive'\ntechnology, USSR, death penalty . . .\nWINDSURFING\nImagine skipping over an azure sea, a warm wind in your hair, the\nsun beating down on your back. This is windsurfing. In Britain, it isn't quite like that\nbut if you are interested in wind surfing, either forming a club or\nsharing petrol money to noted windsurfing venues, please contact Nick A j der ian, Me chEng1 letter-racks or the lounge above Stan's today. We can arrange instructors\ncourses as well as cheap beginners courses. DOUBLE TRIUMPH FOR\nHAMSOC\nLast weekend, members of IC\nAmateur Radio Society took part in two\n\u2022international contests simultaneously,\nand exceeded their expectations in\nboth.\nThe VHF station, G8EY C, was entered\nin the Radio Society of Great Britain\nVHF/ U HG contest. Only the Thursday\nbefore the event, the decision was taken\nto enter the 'single operator' category of\nthis event, with David Hardy (Chemistry\n1) in the 'hot seat'. VHF conditions were\nexcellent, and so David concentrated on\nquality (or rather, distance), rather than\nquantity of contacts. His furthest\ncontact was a new club record: five\nhundred miles to the Austria-Switzerland border. With close to two hundred\ncontacts in the twenty-four hours, his\nefforts should put the club into the top\nfew placings: quite an improvement on\nlast year's last place!\nMeanwhile the HF stations, G5Y C, was taking part in the forty-eight hour\nAmerican Radio Relay League contest,\nattempting to contact as many stations\nas possible world-wide. Progress was\nslow throughout Saturday, and it\nseemed as though the final score would\nonly equal last year's1,222 contacts.\nHowever, several 'rare' countries were\ncontacted, including a few society\n'firsts'. These included several remote\ntropical islands, some of which members of Hamsoc had never heard ofI\nEight hours from the end of the\ncontest, Greg Kaye (Elec Eng 2) took\nover as operator, and amassed an\namazing1,017 contacts. This final\nmarathon sprint was spectacular and\nexciting to watch, with Greg contacting\nfour or more stations per minute at\ntimes. This suddenly elevated the\nsociety's hopes from being an 'also\nran', to that of a top placing. The final\nresult depends on how the opposition\nfared, which will not be known for some\nmonths yet.\nThe final total was 1,831 contacts,\nmade up as follows:\nGreg Kaye (G4DKA) \u2014 1,017 contacts\nRussell Whitworth ( G4 GQ A) \u2014 477\ncontacts\nJan Ch mie lewski( G4 GQ A) \u2014 134\ncontacts\nJohn Savage (G8RRD) \u2014 82 contacts\nPeter Mead (G4DOA) \u2014 81 contacts\nKevin Foster (G8TYO) \u2014 40 contacts\nFinally, credit must go to the team of\nhelpers (better known as Insomniacs\nAnonymous), who gave up their weekend to keep things running. Their\nvital support role Included log keeping,\nduplicate contact checking, on the spot\nequipment repairs, and, of course, making the all important gallons of\ncoffee!\nRussell Whitworth\nPHOTSOC\n\u2022 The Photsoc AGM will be on Tuesday\n11th March at 7:00pm in the Senior\nCommon Room, Sherfield Building. At\nthis meeting the new committee will be\nelected (papers are still up on Photsoc\nNoticeboard next to gents' loo in Union\nBuilding). Also, anyone wishing to enter\nthe annual competition should hand in\ntheir entries.\nThe vacant committee posts are\nchairman, secretary, treasurer, publicity\nofficer, darkroom officer, colour group\nleader, ordinary committee member and\nshop officer.\nThe annual competition will have\nprizes, and there are six categories:\nBlack and White prints (open); Black\nand White Prints (portraits); Black and\nWhite Prints; Colour Prints (open);\nSlides (open); Slides (landscapes).\nEach person may enter up to five\nphotos in each category( they may\nhave been entered in our other com petitions before, but not in a previous\nannual competition). Prints should be\ngreater than sixty square inches in\narea, and not bigger than sixteen by\ntwenty inches.

    "content": "Gravel at Harlington might\nwell provide a golden opportunity for IC to have a sports centre.\nGIVE US\nOUR\nSPORTS\nCENTRE\nThe rather low, flat topped sports\ncentre in Princes Gardens was originally\ndesigned to be a multi storey sports\ncomplex. The foundation for this building\nunder ly the present building, however,\nfinancial restraints at the time of construction prevented the upper stories\nfrom being completed.\nThe college has the resources to\ncomplete the complex if it desires. These\nresources are not held by any financial\nhouse but rest three meters below the\ngreen turf of Harlington, in the form of\nsome twelve meters of very high grade\ngravel. Money for old stone? (Just cast\nyour eyes 500m west of Harlington to the\nvery profitable mining operation.) Certainly these gravels were deposited in\nthe underground bank approximately one\nmillion years ago and their value has\ndefinitely increased.\nExploitation of these gravels would\nprovide the college with more than\nenough capital to build and equip a sports\ncentre extension.\nThe college can not be seen to be a profit making organisation, however, a major aggregate producer could be\ncontracted and the college would receive\nroyalties with no capital outlay. The following facts have been verified by\neconomic and mining consultants.\nThe gravel which underlies Harlington\nsells at \u00a33.50 per tonne. If a contractor\nwas employed to remove it the college\nmay expect 35-60p per tonne royalties.\nOne of the most valuable commodities in\nGreater London at present is a big hole in\nthe ground. Building and civil engineering\nfirms pay heavy duties to dump their\nINERT waste close to London. Harlington's position close to inner London, and its\nproximity to the M4 make it ideal for the\ndumping of inert refuse and transport of\nexcavated gravels.\nThe only inconvenience to college and\nstudents would be the loss of some\npitches (no more than 25% would be out\nat any one time). However, this effect\ncould be minimise d by careful management\nof the type and position of pitches, IC teams\nplaying more away fixtures (some colleges\ndo not have any pitches and play all their\nmatches away). It is rare that all the\nHarlington pitches are used simultaneously.\nMany aggregate contracts possess land for\nsome time after reclamation; if there was the\ndemand for more pitches it would be\npossible to use this on a temporary basis.\nCompletion of the work would take three\nor four years and would raise at least\n\u00a3500,000. As the land is considered to be\ngrade one agricultural land, there would be\nno problem in returning the land to its\n{original state.\nHOW TO VOTE On Monday and Tuesday you will have\na chance to vote; a vote to choose the\nPresident, Deputy President, Honorary\nSecretary and FELIX Editor of your\nchoice.\nThese four posts are full-time \u2014 each\nholder is entitled to a sabbatical year \u2014\nand so the holders largely shape the work\nand role of the Union for twelve months.\nThese people represent you, not\nthemselves, so I urge you to vote.\nHopefully you have met the candidates or\nlistened to them at yesterday's Hustings\nand hence will be able to vote with first\nhand knowledge.

    "content": "Hon. Sec.\nCANDIDATE. Chris Vcalc\nPROPOSER: John Kotrc\nHon. Sec.\nWhy should you read this manifesto?\nQuite simply the answer is that I'm the\nbest candidate for the job, and it's more\ninteresting than the rest of FELIX anyway!\nI'mt all, slim, handsome, come from Colchester and have spent the past four\nyears studying in the Physics department\nat Imperial, where I have a distinguished\nacademic record. Although I 've not been\nseriously involved in the main stream of\nUnion affairs before now I have taken an\nactive role in the running of a number of\nsocieties. I have helped start up the\nIndustrial Society and think it is important\nto foster links between students and industry. AsH on Sec I would try and\ncollaborate with the society to arrange\ntalks on important current affairs, such as\nthe Finniston report. Another society that\nI have helped form is the Hang-Gliding\nClub and would in the future encourage\nthe formation of clubs to cater for new\ninterests.\nI think the Union should be more concerned with issues that concern ordinary students, such as refectories, the\nBookshop, and accommodation. Over the\npast year the effective inactivity of the\nUnion in dealing with the problem of the\nrefectories has been quite noticeable. I think that the Union should be more prepared to deal with those issues effectively. The seeming preoccupation of\nthe Union in passing motions unconnected\nwith College life, and absurd in general, is\none facet which should be curtailed if more\nstudents are to be involved in Union affairs.\n\" Chris Veale amazes me\" \u2014 P Davey\n\"Chris WHO?\" \u2014 Lord F Vote for me in the election for Hon Sec\nChris Veale\nCANDIDATE: Elizabeth Lindsay\nPROPOSER: Nab Kalsi\nLast year I was elected Honour ary Secretary of R CSU and during the year\ngained enormous experience in the organisation of large scale events and in\nthe everyday affairs of the Union. This year Iam Academic Affairs Officer\nof R CSU and have succeeded in forming\nand chairing a very active and worthwhile\ncommittee. As RCS A AOI sit on Council and have been elected to act as YOUR representative on:\nRefectory Committee\nVacation Training Committee IC Health Services Committee I automatically sit on:\nBoard of Studies\nEducational Technology Committee\nLyon Playfair Library Committee and each staff/student committee within\nRCS. Next year issues such as the educational\ncuts and refectories must be pursued and\nI intend to back these up with prompt\nand informative publicity. UG Ms must be\nbrought to the students' attention by\nmeans of Exec News which I hope will\nurge more people to participate in Union\naffairs. Easter 1981 is the date set for the\nIN COST conference to be hosted by IC\nUnion. This will require a large amount of\nwork, but Iam prepared to put in the\ntim e needed to make this prestigious event for the College a success.\nFor a knowledgable, enthusiastic and experienced Hon Sec you have only one\nchoice.\nVote Liz.\nElizabeth Lindsay\nCANDIDATE: Frank James\nProposer: Chris Webb\nThe job of Hon Sec of ICU is essentially\napolitical in that the main function of its\nholder is to ensure that the administration\nof the Union works as smoothly as\npossible; the same function, writ large,\nthat a chairman of a major sub-committee\nperforms. Having chaired the Social Club performs. Having chaired the Social Clubs committee ( S CC) for the past two\nyears with some efficiency, I feel well able\nto tackle the job of Hon Sec.\nNaturally there is also a policy making\nside to the job of Hon Sec; but he can do\nno more than follow Union policy. Therfore there can be no question of an\nHon See's view predominating against the\nwishes of the Union; and I, as a democrat, if\nelected would have no wish to do so.\nOn the issues which certainly face the Union next year there are three of utmost importance which the Hon Sec must deal\nwith. Firstly Union finance will go through a difficult phase needing sensible handling to\nensure that the Union is not adversely\naffected( my two years on finance committee give me considerable knowledge\nof the problems involved). Secondly, the\nInternal Services Committee, if accepted,\nwill require an efficient secretary during its\nfirst year of operation to ensure that it\nsettles in as part of the Union structure as\nsmoothly as possible. Thirdly, responsibility\nof the IN COST conference will ultimately\nfall to the Hon Sec to ensure its success. I have been connected with all these problems since their initiation and therefore\nfeel I have the necessary knowledge to\nperform the duties required to reach successful conclusions on these issues.\nFinally, no union can be effective in representing its members if it has an inefficient secretary. Therefore for a capable Union vote for me for Hon Sec.\nFrank James\n\n"

    "content": "NEWS IN BRIEF\nKIDS TOUR LONDON On Friday 29th February, Imperial\nCollege played host to a group of j thirty school children and teachers\nfrom Laird Street Primary School\nwhich is in a dock land area of\nBirkenhead on Merseyside. The plight of these child reh, being\nbrought up in a back of high unemployment and conditions resembling those of the depression\nwere featured in an article in the\nSunday Times on 1st March.\nTheir day trip to London, or\ngan is ed by IC Community Action!\nGroup was an enjoyable affair for al'\nin v ov led. Seven volunteers, some!\nwould say with masochistic tendencies, went to meet the kids at Euston\nStation. Everyone was then loaded\non to a coach which was hired for the\nday to tour the sights. The coach\ndriver, Sam, was an immediate hit\nwith the children greeting them with\n\"Kids, I don't mind, it's the students,\nI'm worried about\". Those vol-un te ers from the South soon mastered the Merseyside accent ano\nthe coach set off on a magical\nmystery tour of London, with San\nthe driver pouring forth his know\nledge of London over the loud\nspeakers, to a response of loud\npraises of Liverpool Football Club.\nA call was made to the Old Curiosity\nShop, something it was never\ndesigned for. The proprietor thrust\nwads of postcards in the children's' hands in an effort to get rid of\nthem.\nThe kids were then taken on a boat trip on the Thames and though they enjoyed this, they\nwere bitterly disappointed not to\nspot any sharks.\nThe first match was played last Wednesday in the Sparkes Cup\nbetween Guilds and RCS. Guilds won 17-7.\nThe sights soon exhausted, even\nSam' s birthplace, the Tower of\nLondon (true!), the kids were then\ntaken round the Science Museum.\nEach volunteer was assigned four\nchildren, which in most cases proved too many. One volunteer\nreturned with only two, the remaining two being found, after about\nfifteen minutes panic, hiding in an\nold London train.\nTo end the day a tea party was\nprovided in the I CW A Lounge and\nafter a dash back to Euston they\nwere waved goodbye, by a small\ngroup of formerly innocent young\nIC students who were by then just\nshells of their former selves.\nAs for the kids, they thoroughly\nenjoyed themselves and they\ncordially invite us up to Birkenhead.\nAny takers? No? I thought not.\nTHE GREAT IMPERIAL RAG RACE.\nAt 2.00pm last Friday, the Bot/Zoo\ntea room witnessed the start of the\nGreat I.C. Rag race. Encouraged by\npromises of fame fortune and cases\nof Swan, about twenty people set off\nby various methods, all hoping to sell\nthe most, go furthest or travel by the\nweirdest method possible. Having found a likely looking partner\nin the form of Steve Hutchings, the\nfirst task was to get to Staples Corner\nto try to hitch a lift North. Weighed\ndown by Rucksacks, Rag-Mags and\nbottles of Scotch, we arrived at the\nMl at 3.30, after losing our way\nbetween it and Brent Cross Underground Station (Good start!).\nTwo lifts and a Watford Gap coffee\nlater we arrived in Sheffield.\nSomehow Steve has 301bs more in his\nrucksack than I have, although we\ncan't find it. Once at the University,\nthe Raq Maqs sold fairly well, helped\nalong by a friendly Rag committee.\nSaturday1.00 am found us\nwandering around Sheffield looking\nfor the station (lost again h The overnight train took us to\nDundee.Dawn over the Firth.of\nForth saw us struggle awake to face a breakfast of BR. coffee.crisps and a liberal measure of Scotch. 9.00am saw us arrive in Dundee to find\nalmost everybody sleeping off a monster party. Undeterred we\npressed on, finally to be invited for a cup of tea oy an attractive young\nlady. Encouraged by this, every\nsleeping person in her hall was\noffered a chance to buy an I.C. RagMag.Having roused the whole Hall,\nwe departed for Newcastle. Breakfast\n5:50pm and we were lost again.\nAfter passing a purple Town Hall\nwe finally arrived at Newcastle\nUniversity. Their own Rag Mag was\nbanned from being sold in the\nUnion but that didn't stop us from\nselling our one. A friendly reception\nand a great evening, disturbed only\nby a minor panic where we thought\nour rucksacks had been locked\naway overnight in a cloakroom.\n10:45pm, and we departed from\nNewcastle bound for Leicester.\nSunday1:10 am, three miles\ngone, hundreds to go. Hitching at\none o 'clock on a Sunday morning\nis definitely not recommended. Hitching was abandoned and we\nwalked back to the city centre in\nsearch of a coach. 3:00am, we\nwere freezing and the coach still\ndidn't depart for another four\nhours. The bus station was shut up\nso there was nothing else to do but\nsleep on the pavement, becoming\nhypo the r mic in the process, the\nwaiting room opened at 5:00am giving us a chance to start thawing\nout. No coaches to Leicester so we\ndecided to get a coach home.\n10:25am Woohall services somewhere near Sheffield again. Our\nfirst hot meal since Thursday. More fitful sleep on the coach and\nlast we were back in London. Sunday night in the bar sees the\nreturn of other intrepid travellers\neach with their own tales of\nuniversities conquered and Rag\nMags sold.\nMost Sold: Matthew Smith (LSI)\n\u00a360.42 collected.\nMost Sold per hour: Frank Rowsell (BE1) \u00a3 1 2 2 per hour.\nFurthest Distance: Steve Hutchings (Chem 1) to Dundee.\nMost Unsual Method of Travel:\nPhil Greenstreet (Physics 1) who flew\nfrom Gatwick to Exeter.\nCommiserations to all other\nparticipants, who took part, but\ndidn't quite make it, especially the\nnameless Guildsman who got to\nPerth.\nMatthew Smith\nCounting the loot: a total of\n\u00a3540 was raised for Rag.\n3\n\n"

    "content": "MINES Last weekend was yet another storm er for Mines. At the Nottingham Rugby\nSevens the first team beat Newcastle firsts by 22 to 4 in the final to win the\nUnion Corp silver salver. (We are in fact\nthe only holders of it.)\nCongratulations to the seconds on reaching the semi-final, the thirds who scored seven points and conceded 100\nand to T Rev and Helicopters Newman for clearing up their Ralph and Hughies.\nIn the Soccer Sixes RS M won21 in the\nfinal after extra time.\nWell done Dave Rhodes and Stevie Hinde, the rug g er(2g's Trev) and soccer\ncaptains.\nOn Sunday Andy NOrman and the boys were unlucky to lose 8-7 to Arsey\nEss, but they still won the overall competition to pickup the Whitbread Trophy.\nOn Wednesday 12th March it is the\nMINES REVIEW in the J CR. Tickets \u00a31.00 from R SMU and ICU Offices and bars.

This definitely illustrates the overall trend for the election.\nA very high quality of candidates for\nthe five posts means that some must fail.\nBut the fact that the elections were well\ncontested shows that there is a great\nstrength in depth within the Union. Many congratulations must go to the successful\ncandidates, along with very strong commiseration to the unsuccessful ones\nwho we must hope will persevere and provide the nucleus of union members\nwho are so important to the continuing\nsuccess and strength of the Royal College\nof Science Union. Let's hope that the relatively good support for the Hustings and Results UG Ms continues and increases up to the\nAGM when the rest of the officers are\nelected.\nThere was a high RCS entry to the Great\nImperial Rag Race. In all Rag managed to sell\nanother 2,000 Rag Mags and they seem to\nbe heading towards making a profit. At last\nthe indifferent attitude is going and one\nhundred and fifty people came to the Hustings U GM. Keep your eyes open for all\nthe end of term events, such as the Deaf\nKiddies party tomorrow with lost s of jelly\nand ice-cream for all. The Black And White\nMinstrel Rag on Saturday 15th March \u2014\nblack your face and sing the blues to help\nthe deaf.\nFinally remember the IC elections on Monday and Tuesday. Use your vote.\nCITY AND GUILDS The Swimming Gala held on Monday was yet another resounding victory for\nGuilds.

During\nthe weekend there is the run up to the\nelections, which are held on Tuesday.\nFORTHCOMING EVENTS\nSaturday 8th March: Election Rag.
