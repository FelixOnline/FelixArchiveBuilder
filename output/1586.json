    "content": "10 THE STUDENT PAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON FELIX\n31.10.2014\nComment Comment Editor Tessa Davey\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFor most people the thought\nof attending Union Council\nis not good \u2013 to be honest,\nmost people don\u2019t even know what\nCouncil is \u2013 but for those who do it\nis often thought of as a chore and is\nan evening that they would rather\nspend elsewhere. Personally I rather\nenjoy the process of locking people\nin a room until they come to an\nagreement on some important issues.\nTuesday\u2019s Council Meeting (the\nsecond one this year) was true to\nform; it had the usual mix of papers,\nreports, lots of arguing and generally\ngetting a numb bottom from sitting\naround for some time on hard seats;\nbut it also had the delightfully\namusing spectacle of members\nhaving to get up and walk to opposing\nsides of the room to vote \u2013 left for\nyes, right for no, and standing in\nthe middle for an abstention. To\nadd to the confusion, the matter\nunder discussion was about how\nCouncil votes and whether the votes\nof individual members should be\nrecorded, with the number of sub-points to be voted upon constantly\nchanging. As a candidate that ran\nagainst Paul Beaumont (Chair of the\nmeeting) for the job of shepherding\nCouncil, I am not sure if I\u2019m glad I\ndidn\u2019t have the job of trying to deal\nwith the chaos or not.\nAnother wonderful product of the\nmeeting is that the Union\u2019s Executive\nCommittee now has no members,\ndoes not meet and does not have\nany remit whatsoever \u2013 this is to get\naround the rule that Council can\u2019t get\nrid of the Exec but has decided that it\nhas no function.\nI reckon that this has been one of\nthe most fun-filled Council meetings\nwith yet more prime examples of\nhow Council is bad at its job, and that\nsadly is why I am upset. Don\u2019t get me\nwrong, I do think Council can be fun,\nand it doesn\u2019t need to take forever;\nbut when people bemoan the fact\nthat they have to attend a two hour\nmeeting as an elected representative\n(which they chose to run for) which\nhas massive power over how our\nUnion is run, I get quite worked up.\nCouncil is an important part of\nthe Union\u2019s structure, regardless of\nwhether you know or care about it.\nIf you are on Council then you have\ndecided to run for a position that\nmeans you have to be at Council, so\nturn up, and express opinions.\nI do not consider that a two hour\nmeeting is that long, and when even\nthe Chair of the meeting complains\nabout the length or apologises for\nthe same, then all that happens is\nyou reinforce the image that Council\nis too long and is boring. Read the\npapers, engage with the debate, and\naccept that there will be some items\nof business that don\u2019t necessarily\ndirectly impact on you.\nWhilst the spectacle of some of\nthe brightest minds in the Country\nhaving to resort to walking to\nopposing sides of the wrong to add\nup who votes yes (or doesn\u2019t vote)\nis fun to watch, the general farce\nthat surrounded the debate and the\nfinal decision of sending a group\naway to research something that was\nresearched last year and to come back\nand report on whether something\nis feasible despite a general lack of\ninterest in adopting the new approach\nis ridiculous and sad. Surely we can\nactually produce a series of decisions\nthat makes coherent and logical\nsense, with a final outcome which\nactually achieves something.\nWhat Council needs is a change of\nattitude \u2013 especially amongst some\nof its members. It needs to recognise\nthat it has a big role, that spending\n40 minutes debating something is\nproductive (assuming good chairing)\nand that for the amount of power\nand responsibility it has, taking\nthe time to do things properly with\nclear resolutions to vote on is the\nway things should be done, and\nthat means that the meetings may\nbe longer than people may be used\nto. The real test will be whether the\nattendance of members of Council\ncontinues to be high over the course\nof the year, and whether it once again\nwill struggle to achieve the level\nof attendance to it needs to make\ndecisions (something it struggles with\nevery year).\nWhat we as members of the Union\nneed to do is discuss the topics that\nare coming to Council, engage with\nthem and tell them what the issues\nare for us, what we think the cost of\nUniversity degrees should be, and\nask them whether they had fun at the\nlast Council meeting. You could even\ncome along yourself and contribute,\nyou may find it fun \u2013 I do.\nIs this way of voting just an excuse to stretch legs?

We carved that\npumpkin during the late hours of\nTuesday night, and we then took it to\nACC Sports Night to photograph it on\nWednesday. After chasing down some\ndrunk fresher who tried to steal it\nfrom us when our backs were turned,\nwe managed to get a great shot that\nwould have made an eye-catching, if\nnews-less front page cover.\nUnfortunately, The Evening\nStandard went to print before we\ndid, and published the story about\nmisbehaving rugby players, that we\ncover more extensively on page 4.\nFelix was already investigating the\nstory concerning some of the Medic\nRugby players streaking on camera\nwhen this story hit the headlines, so\nwe have merged them together to\nshow that in reality, what may have\nbeen an isolated incident may, in\nfact, link into a larger subculture of\ndrinking through sports clubs.\nIt is debatable whether or not such\na subculture is damaging to those it\ninvolves (or excludes as it may be),\nand those it inadvertently involves\ntoo. People were annoyed when their\ntube was delayed by eights minutes,\nand they probably didn\u2019t enjoy seeing\na student strip to his boxers on a tube\nplatform.\nBut the damage such behaviour\nfrom such a small subset of students\ndoes to the reputation of students on\na whole is far worse.\nSports clubs will always drink\nduring their socials; they always have\ndone. Students will drink themselves\nsilly too, regardless of being in a team\nor not; we only have to look back to\nthree issues ago when we covered\nthe drama surrounding the drunken\nmedic student on the boat, another\nstory picked up by The Evening\nStandard.\nUnfortunately, outside of the\nImperial bubble, and outside\nof socials, drunken students\nmisbehaving carry with them the\nconnotations of all students being\na public menace, a waste of tuition\nfees, louts and idiots. It is the people\noutside of this bubble that know that\nthese connotations translate into\nclicks on an article, hits on a website,\nand, eventually, money in their\npockets.\nHowever, after speaking to the boys\non the team today once the story\nbroke, many do not seem to be any of\nthese things at all, and were keen to\npoint out that it was the case of a few\npeople misbehaving and tarnishing\nthe reputation of the rest of the team.\nConsider this an example of how\nthe press regards students, and\nperhaps be wary in the future about\nhow you conduct yourself once you\nleave the Union walls. The isolated\nactions of a few have stopped the fun\nof their team members, and can harm\nthe reputation of students as a whole\nin the long run, something we are all,\nno doubt, keen to avoid.\nSKETT\u2019S BOX OF SHAME\nApologies for some mistakes in\nIssue 1585. These were:\n- Mis-spelling Conall O\u2019Neill\u2019s name\nat the top of his article in Music\nIn issue 1584, in our article on\nthe amenitites fund, we printed\nthe wrong igures for Gabor and\nLinstead in our graph, confusing\nthem with igures for the entirity\nof Eastside and Southside.\nThanks to Vasa Curin for correcting\nus.

All over the\nUS, cries from the big names on the\nAmerican Right (Jindal, Paul, Christie\net al) have called for: the closure of\nborders, the grounding of flights, and\nthe implementation of draconian\nquarantine procedures. Their calls\nstand in stark contrast to the opinions\nof much of the scientific community,\nwho say that the greatest defence\nagainst Ebola is a good offence; that\nwe must smother the outbreak before\nit becomes too widespread to handle\neffectively. This means allowing the\nfree movement of manpower and\nmaterial so as to equip aid workers\nwith the tools necessary to fight new\noutbreaks, and suppress existing ones.\nTheir opinions have fallen on deaf\nears. A few days ago, Mr Christie took\nmatters into his own hands, forcing a\nyoung healthcare worker into a badly\nventilated, poorly sanitised tent in\nNewark; the first example of his oft\ntalked about \u2018quarantine measure\u2019.\nWith the likelihood of the GOP (or\nthe Republican party) making large\ngains in the senate in November,\nfurther such cases are almost an\ninevitability.\nOf course, Christie and his ilk\nare easy targets. Theirs is a cry of \u2018a\ncommon-sense perspective\u2019, where\nnuance and subtlety give way to\nsimplicity and facility. Their cries are\npart wilful ignorance, part midterm\nelectoral pandering. However, they\nare wholly damaging and harmful.\nThey are not the only culprits.\nThe disproportionate levels of\nalarm in the states - and in many\nother countries around the world\n\u2013 is propagated by a trifecta of\nuninformed policy making, shoddy\nreporting, and a muted scientific\ncommunity. The last point is perhaps\nthe most important of the three:\njournalists will report poorly, and\npolicy makers will act ignorantly so\nlong as they are able to do so with\nlittle opposition. The scientific\ncommunity must be that opposition.\nOf course, the scientific community\nchooses not to. After all, we have\nbetter things to occupy ourselves\nwith, right?\nThe truth is that we must assert\nourselves. We should be looking\nIn Signatures of the Visible, Fredric\nJameson states that \u201cthe visual\nis essentially pornographic\u201d\n\u2013 that is, its end is in \u201cmindless\nrapture\u201d. That being said, as any\nreader of Orwell knows, there\nare degrees of equality; that is to\nsay, while all \u2018visuals\u2019 (forgive the\nclumsy expression) are essentially\npornographic, some are more\nessentially pornographic than\nothers. The trial of Oscar Pistorius,\nso widely broadcast this summer,\nwas one of these paradoxical beasts\n\u2013 the Napoleons and Squealers, the\ngenerally \u2018more equal\u2019. The obscene\nspectacle of a sordid celebrity tragedy\nwas seized upon by the major news\nchannels as not only a worthy news\npiece but further as so important as\nto merit global coverage. It seems\nthis turgid carnival with a faceless\nprotagonist succeeded in trumping\nGeorge Alagiah and Adam Boulton\nalike. The trial even inspired some\nprogram titles \u2013 my favourite:\n\u2018Oscar Pistorius: The Sentencing\u2019 \u2013\nreminiscent of the cheap thrillers\npurchased in airport lobbies,\nhalf-read before swiftly falling into\ndesuetude.\nI must confess that I did not follow\nthe trial. I don\u2019t know the ins and\nouts of the case, the arguments or\nthe technicalities. I didn\u2019t actually\nknow the verdict until I googled\nthe trial for this article. I was, to\nbe frank, mostly indifferent to an\nessentially private affair and slightly\nrepulsed by the vulgarity of the\ncoverage. I am dubious about the\npropriety of broadcasting a trial from\na country which constitutionally\npresumes innocence and I suspect\nmedia coverage does not a little\nto undermine formal equality\nbefore the law. These are, however,\nsubjective impressions and the proper\nsociological studies would have to\nbe made before asserting them with\nany confidence. I was disgraced by\na media which can dissect like a\nvulture the offcuts of a domestic legal\naffair while refusing to broadcast the\ndevastation of Israeli bombs on the\ngrounds of \u2018respect for the dead\u2019.\nThe worst of it, however, becomes\napparent if we compare it to\nthe media response to the state-sanctioned murder of 34 South\nAfrican miners at the Marikana\nplatinum mine in 2012. A further\n78 were injured. If I Google the\nwords \u201cMarikana platinum mine\u201d\nthere are 274 thousand hits in\ncomparison to the 13 million for\n\u201cOscar Pistorius trial\u201d. This though\nthe Marikana strikes kicked off the\nyear of greatest protest in South\nAfrica since Apartheid. This though\ntwo years on no policeman has faced\njail for the use of live ammunition on\nfleeing crowds. This though the strike\nmarked South Africa\u2019s \u201cfirst post-apartheid massacre\u201d.\nIt appears that the mass murder\nof black workers in South Africa\nand the most important event in the\ncountry\u2019s recent history deserves\na week of coverage \u2013 as much\ncondemnation of the strikers as\nsensible analysis \u2013 while the violent\n\u201cindiscretion\u201d of one of the country\u2019s\nex-\u2018darlings\u2019 several months. Sadly\nthis balance will not be redressed\nthrough the major media channels.\nThere are, however, other ways; next\nWednesday the documentary film\n\u2018Miners Shot Down\u2019 which follows the\nevents at Marikana is showing at the\nHackney Picturehouse. It would be an\nirenic fantasy to expect this to bring\nabout greater parity, but the more\npeople who are aware, the more can\nbe made aware. Book a ticket.\nShould we accept reporting of factual errors?\nRelections on Oscar Pistorius, Marikana and\nthe Media\nCHRISTY KELLY\nCOMMENT WRITER\n\"I was, to\nbe frank,\n[...] slightly\nrepulsed by the\nvulgarity of the\ncoverage.\"\n\"The cost to\nhuman life will\nonly increase;\nwe cannot\nafford to be\nsilent on this\nissue.\"\n\"The obscene\nspectacle\nof a sordid\ncelebrity\ntragedy\"\n\"It would\nbe an irenic\nfantasy to\nexpect this\nto bring\nabout\ngreater\nparity\"\nNATHANIEL GALLOP\nCOMMENT WRITER\nat Christie with the contempt we\nreserve for homeopaths, or anti-vaccination advocates.

I\u2019m Osama Awara,the editor who last\nyear brought you the technology murder list series\nwith his partner in crime Maximillian Eggl.For my\nsecond year as tech editor,get ready for more reviews\non the latest tech products and top ten tech lists that\nwill leave you questioning whether that iPhone 6 you\nbought was a bent idea.\nIf you are interested in writing an article for tech,as\na one off or on a regular basis,just send your articles\nto me or Jamie via technology.felix@imperial.ac.uk.\nWe will make sure your articles are up and running\nfor the next issue; any positive reviews on Apple\nproducts will be marked as\u2018junk\u2019.\nAll jokes aside,please do not hesitate to contact us\nabout any ideas you have for an upcoming article.\n\"Expect\nframe rates\nthat would\nleave you\nfeeling like\nyou're\ngaming on\na flipbook.\"\nThe third generation of\nWindows tablets, or Lablets\nas I like to call them, have\nbeen released by Microsoft. They\nclaim that the Surface Pro 3 is not\nonly a tablet, but a laptop as well,\npotentially replacing both of those\ndevices in your home. After owning\none for several weeks, I can honestly\nback Microsoft on this one. I have\nnot touched my old laptop since the\npurchase; it is currently sitting in a\nbedroom drawer collecting dust.\nThe beautiful thing about this\ndevice is how seamlessly you can\ninterchange between using it as a\ntablet and a laptop. For instance, as\nI write this article I am in desktop\nmode tapping away at the keyboard,\nwhilst being able to touch anywhere\non the screen to select anything from\nthe Word 2013 and Google Chrome\nicons to the volume adjustment icon.\nHowever, by selling the attachable\nkeyboard separately Microsoft has,\nin my opinion, shot itself in the foot,\nappearing to be like the [video games\ndeveloper] EA of the tech world. I\npurchased my Surface Pro 3 with the\ncore i5 processor and a 256 GB solid\nstate drive for a relatively hefty price\nin Canada. The keyboard sold for\n$150 (Canadian dollars that is) which\nis around \u00a380 \u2013 an unreasonable\nextra charge considering the initial\nprice of the system (around \u00a3830).\nHowever, in terms of ergonomics the\nkeyboard works well and is backlit.\nMost of the Surface Pro 3s come\nwith 256GB of memory which is not\na lot if you are planning to properly\nuse your device as a laptop. It is\ncompensated by the fact that this\ndevice is solid state (free of moving\nmechanical parts), meaning that\nyour Surface Pro will have much\nfaster loading speeds compared to\ntraditional hard drives which run\non rotating magnetic discs. Also,\nif you\u2019re planning to game on this\ndevice, you will certainly fill up your\nmemory quickly.\nOn the topic of gaming, the Surface\nPro is very decent for a tablet but if\nyou are planning to run hardcore\ngames such as Battlefield, expect\nframe rates that would leave you\nfeeling like you\u2019re gaming on a\nflipbook; the integrated graphics card\njust won\u2019t be able to handle it.\nThe tablet has multiple degrees of\npositioning due to the flap on the rear\nof the device; this gives the Surface\nPro 3 several different modes of use.\nIf you want the device to work as\na laptop you would position the flap\nso that the screen is vertical with a\nslight slant. If you are in a lecture and\nwant to take notes with the Surface\nPro stylus, you can position the flap\nsuch that the screen is positioned\nhorizontally with a slight vertical\nslant \u2013 the perfect position to write.\nThe stylus does a good job at writing\nand although your handwriting with\na pen won\u2019t be mimicked, you will\nstill get reasonable results.\nOverall, am I satisfied with the\nSurface Pro 3? It definitely checks\nboth the boxes that a tablet and\nlaptop should, running everything\nTech-companies want to expand\ntheir product portfolio outside\nof smartphones, and with iPad\nand tablet sales falling quarter after\nquarter and all the variety in screen\nsizes pretty much exhausted, where\ndo they go from here?\nFor some, the answer to that\nquestion seems to be wearable\ntechnology. The market is still in its\ninfancy, but sales have tripled in the\nlast year and are predicted to rise\nto 250 million devices sold in 2018.\nApple Watch is certainly next year\u2019s\ndevice to have but with a market as\nbig as this it\u2019s anyone\u2019s game.\nCompanies like Samsung and\nPebble have been rushing to lead the\npack; even Google entered the game\njust 3 months ago, but with the Apple\nWatch imminent for the start of 2015\nand Microsoft rumoured to release\nits own wearable this holiday season,\nthings are certainly heating up.\nJust 3 million smart-bands and\nsmartwatches have sold all over\nthe world up until now \u2013 while\ncompanies are still struggling to hit\nthe right combination of usability,\n\u2018comfortability\u2019, longevity and\nmost importantly design. With our\nlives already surrounded by and so\ndependent on our devices, the most\ndifficult hurdle manufacturers\nare facing is actually convincing\nconsumers that we need another one.\nOne company who seem to have\nfound the recipe for success is Pebble.\nBefore any of the big boys were even\nthinking about making a smartwatch,\nPebble was already breaking\ncrowdfunding records with its own\nextremely simplified smartwatch.\nIt managed to raise 10 million\ndollars and take 85,000 orders on\nKickstarter with just a low resolution\nblack and white LCD display, a simple\nplastic design and a price tag of \u00a379.\nThe company has reported that\nmore than 400,000 units have been\nmoved since January 2013, which is\nimpressive considering how young\nthe company is.\nThe Pebble was successful but not\nrevolutionary, its sensible features\nand low price tag appealing mostly to\nthe tech-savvy niche market without\nit ever really going mainstream.\nShortly after, Samsung came along\nwith the Galaxy Gear, a smartwatch\nwhich tried to do too much without\nreally getting any of it right.\nSamsung\u2019s first smartwatch cost a\nridiculous \u00a3299 and it left behind a\nlot of displeased tech-reviewers.

Sales numbers are not\nvery clear but Samsung seems to be\nheading up the wearables market\nwith more than 800,000 total units\nsold, a minuscule number when put\nin perspective with Samsung\u2019s other\ndevice sales.

His recovery was hailed as\n\u2018more impressive than man walking\non the moon\u2019 by Geoffrey Raisman,\nwhose research at University College\nLondon almost 30 years ago made\nFidyka\u2019s recovery possible.\nMany decades of research and trials\nhave gone into spinal cell repair\ntechniques, but few have yielded\nsuccessful results. Until now it was\ncommonly thought that paralysed\npatients would unlikely to ever walk\nagain. This is because the nerve\ncell axons that connect the rest\nof the body to the brain, allowing\nmovement and sensation, are\nnotoriously difficult to repair once\ndamaged. The body\u2019s natural healing\nprocess forms a thick glial scar over\nthe injured region that inhibits\nthe regeneration of nerve axons,\npermanently severing connection\nto the brain, and so sensation and\nmovement are lost.\nProfessor Raisman\u2019s research\nin 1985 showed that the nerve\nconnection to the brain following\nspinal injury could be regained in\nmice following transplantation of\nolfactory ensheathing cells (OECs)\ninto the injured spinal cord.\nOECs are support cells in the body\u2019s\ncomplex circuitry for the sense of\nsmell. This neural circuitry is the\nonly part of the human nervous\nsystem that regenerates throughout\nadult life. This is because each odour\nwe encounter is transmitted back to\nthe olfactory bulbs at the top of the\nnasal cavity by nerves in the nose.\nThese nerves are constantly being\ndamaged and need to be replaced.\nOECs facilitate this regeneration\nprocess.\nA research team led by Dr Pawel\nTabakow, a consultant neurosurgeon\nat Wroclaw University Hospital, has\nbuilt on this concept by transplanting\nOECs to the site of injury on Mr\nFidyka\u2019s spinal cord. The team\nremoved one of the patient\u2019s\nolfactory bulbs and used it to derive a\nculture containing OECs.\nThe cultured OECs were then\ntransplanted into the spinal cord\nstumps above and below the injury\nin 100 micro injections, and the\neight millimeter gap created by the\nknife wound was bridged by four\nstrips of nerve from Mr Fidyka\u2019s leg.\nThe transplanted nerve acted as a\nscaffold and the OECs allowed the\nnerve axons in the spine to regrow. As\nall the cells came from the patient\u2019s\nbody, there was no risk of rejection.\nFollowing the surgery, Mr Fidyka\nhas undergone intense physiotherapy\nalmost every day. After just three\nmonths his doctors noticed that\nhe had gained muscle mass in his\nleft thigh. Six months later, he was\nable to begin to take his first steps\nusing parallel bars and the help of a\nphysiotherapist.\nNow, 19 months later, he is able to\nwalk outside the rehabilitation centre\nusing a frame. He has regained some\nsensation in his left leg, and his bowel\nfunction has improved.\nImaging has shown that the grafts\nhad bridged the left side of the spinal\ncord, where the majority of the nerve\ngrafts were implanted.\nNone of the researchers want to\nprofit from the discovery. Professor\nRaisman has said \u201cit would be my\nproudest boast if I could say that no\npatient had had to pay one penny\nfor any of the information we have\nfound.\u201d\nIt is to be noted that the two\npatients treated previously with\nthis technique by Dr Tabakow did\nnot regain function. The scientists\nare hoping to recreate Mr Fidyka\u2019s\nsuccess in another ten patients in\nPoland and Britain over the coming\nyears, research grants permitting.\nIt could take many years for the\ntechnique to become mainstream, but\nuntil now there has been little hope\nfor paralysis patients to regain their\nindependence. What is doubtless is\nthat Mr Fidyka\u2019s tentative steps have\nmeant a giant leap for mankind.\nDOI: 10.3727/096368914X685131\nThe Ebola outbreak has claimed\nabout 4,900 lives to date,\nmostly in the poverty-stricken\ncountries in West Africa \u2014 Sierra\nLeone, Liberia and Guinea. As the\ndeath toll and number of cases rise ex-ponentially, scientists are scrambling\nto develop treatments that would stop\nthis epidemic, which Oxfam describes\nas a \u201chumanitarian disaster\u201d. Until\nthere are vaccines approved by the\nFDA, standard public health containment measures will be used to control\nthe situation.\nThe Ebola virus is particularly\nadept at evading our immune system,\nand among the proteins which play a\nrole in it are VP35 and VP24. VP35\nassembles into a dimer and then\ncoats the RNA backbone of the virus\nto prevent detection by the immune\nsystem. VP24 blocks the cellular\nproduction of interferons, molecules\nwhich signal the presence of the virus.\nThe receptor site of the virus remain\nhidden beneath its glycoprotein\nbranches, also to avoid recognition,\nuntil the branches attach to the host\ncell and allow the virus\u2019 penetration\nand entry. Another characteristic\nin its favour is the filament-like structure of Ebola virus particles which\ngives it a large surface area to attack\nmany cells.\nThe virus starts by infecting the\nleukocytes, then nearly all other cell\ntypes, which leads to death less than\n16 days after the onset of the disease.\nThe first symptoms include fever and\nheadache, followed by severe stomach\npains, sore throats and bloody diarrhoea as the virus multiplies. The\ninfected cells then attach to the vessels and arteries, weakening them and\nresulting in haemorrhage.\nIn hopes of sparing more Africans\nfrom this unbearable pain, a massive\nresearch effort has begun to discover\nways to defeat the Ebola virus. A vaccine known as ChAd3 is a chimpanzee\ncold virus vector incorporated with\nebolavirus gene segments. Along with\nanother vaccine called VSV, it was observed to give durable immunity and\nboth vaccines are currently undergoing clinical trials.\nRecently, the Wyss Institute of\nHarvard University announced their\nongoing work on a biospleen device\nwhich may (or may not) obviate the\nneed for vaccines. The device acts\nrather like a spleen, filtering viruses\nfrom the blood using a magnet. This\nhas brought hope for the treatment of\nEbola, but its development and testing would take months or years.\nThere is also the possibility of the\nEbola virus mutating to become more\nvirulent or infective, in which case it\nwould outrace the current efforts of\ntargeting the current virus strain.\nNow we can only hope that treatments will be available soon, and that\nthe Ebola virus will not become too\nprolific until the situation gets out\nof control. All this shows us the paradoxical nature of viruses, which are\nsuch simple organisms yet so difficult\nto control. The Ebola virus causes uncontrollable internal bleeding\nPhoto: Wikimedia Commons\nAfter 19\nmonths, he\nis now able\nto walk\noutside\nusing a\nframe\n\n"

Taking\nthe District Line down from South\nKensington, I get off at Mansion\nHouse; twisting through the streets of\nthe Golden Mile, dodging city slickers\nand corporate lawyers, a cluster of\nbuildings soon come into view - the\nlabyrinthine, awe-inspiring Barbican\nCentre.\nDesigned by Chamberlin, Powell &\nBon, and built between 1965-76, the\nBarbican is cut from a different cloth\nthan the buildings surrounding it;\nwhile they are made of shimmering\nglass, temples to high-tech finance,\nthe Barbican is formed from raw\nconcrete, relentlessly carving out its\nown space within the city.\nThe term Barbican comes from\nthe old French word Barbacane,\nmeaning the outer defence of a walled\ncity or castle. While the name was\nchosen millennia before the complex\nwas built, it is serendipitous how\nwell the name matches up to the\nbuildings. With miles of walkways,\nwhich tunnel through buildings, it is\nworryingly easy to get lost; cement\narches loom over you, while concrete\nbalustrades form outposts from\nthe main structures. In essence, the\nBarbican reclaims the original ethos\nof the area \u2013 it is a brutalist dragon,\njealously guarding the treasure at its\ncentre: the glittering gem of London\u2019s\ncultural crown, the Barbican Centre\nitself.\nWith a concert hall, two theatres,\na music school, three restaurants,\ntwo art galleries, and a greenhouse,\nthe Barbican Centre is the closest\nthe artistically-inclined have to a\nMecca. It is a cathedral of culture,\nlike a wondrous mirage in the middle\nof a corporate desert. From film to\ntheatre, music to dance, everything\nyou could ask for can be found here,\neclipsing any other venues in London.\nHowever, even if you\u2019re not that\nmuch of a culture vulture \u2013 and to\nbe honest, it can be difficult to find\nthe time \u2013 you can still enjoy the\nBarbican. As you peel away the layers\nof cement, penetrating the outer walls\nof this fortress, you come across a\nlush, verdant centre. Vines trail down\nfrom balcony apartments; fountains\nspring up, the dappling water creating\na melodic soundtrack to a lazy day;\nand little niches form areas where\nyou can easily wile away an entire\nafternoon.\nOn hot summer days, when Hyde\nPark is full to bursting, and The\nHampstead Ponds are at full capacity,\nyou can always rely on the Barbican\nCentre to provide a calm clearing\nwithin the city\u2019s concrete jungle. Take\nyour friends, take a picnic, take a\nbottle of good wine, and see how easy\nit is to spend an entire day soaking up\nthe sun\u2019s rays at this magnificently\nbrutal tribute to modern culture.\nDARA RASASINGAM\n3RD YEAR MED STUDENT\nThe Barbican Centre is open MonSat, 9am-11pm; Sun, 10am-11pm. Their\nprogramme includes Theatre, Cinema,\nDance, Music, and Arts, as well as\nspecial events and talks.\nCurrent highlights include the City\nVisions programme of films and art\nexhibits.

Hopefully, her article\nwill help convert some to the way of 60\u2019s\narchitecture.\nNext, we have Lizzie\u2019s look at the world\nof Giovanni Battista Moroni, an artist\nthat history seems to have forgotten. As\nRenaissance portraiture goes, there really\nis no one better! I mean, just look at the\nway he captures the sitter\u2019s emotion. But\nwe\u2019ll let Lizzie tell you more about that.\nWith any luck, this exhibition will bring\nhim back onto people\u2019s radars after much\ntoo long.\nNow looking more at the modern day,\nFred talks about The National Videogame\nArcarde opening in Nottingham, which\nlooks to throw the art world into chaos\nas it redefines what art is in the digital\nage, where people\u2019s greatest exposure to\ndesign and creativity is often through the\nmedium of video games. We\u2019ll see how it\nall pans out.\nThe Anatomy of Melancholy is part of a\nrare breed, a contemporary opera. Such is\nthe skill and expense required to create an\nopera that you hardly ever see a new one\ncome on the seen. We sent Elizaveta to go\nand see whether the production lived up to\nthis expectation and whether it was able to\ntackle the gargantuan issue of depression\nwith any new insight.\nWell there you go, from Brutalist\narchitecture to Renaissance painting,\nvideo games and finally contemporary\nopera, London (and Nottingham) has it all!\nWhat more could you want?\n\n"

For comparison, in August\n2013, it raised just $2.8 million. ALS\nis a terrible condition and the money\ndonated by ice bucket challengers\nis already beginning to be put to\nuse helping find cures for it. Other\ninternational funds such as ALS\nAustralia and MND here in the UK\nhave received orders-of-magnitude\nincreases in donations, and are also\nfunding research, both domestic and\ninternational.\nMost medical research relies\nheavily on the use of animal models\nto characterise how diseases affect\nsufferers, and how they can be\ncontrolled and cured. Research\ninto ALS is no exception. Public\nopinion of animal testing for medical\npurposes remains largely in favour,\nbut is dropping. 10 years ago, support\nfor medical research on animals stood\nat 75%; it\u2019s now down to 68%.\nAs well as this drop in support,\npollsters Ipsos MORI found that if\nyou phrase the question differently,\nyou get different results. Asking\nthe public if \u2018Animal Research\u2019 was\nacceptable, 68% of people replied that\nit was. If this is changed to the more\ngrizzly \u2018Animal Experimentation\u2019 the\nnumber in favour drop to 64%.\n64% is still a large majority of\npublic opinion in favour of animal\ntesting. However the most interesting\nfinding of Ipsos MORI\u2019s poll was that\nonly 30% of Brits feel they are \u201cwell\ninformed\u201d about animal research in\nthe UK. 1 in 3 respondents thought\nthat animals could be used for\ncosmetics research, even though this\nhas been illegal for 15 years.\nThe ALS foundation is not secretive\nabout how its money goes to animal\nexperiments; you can click straight\nthrough to a press statement about\nmouse model research from the\nALS homepage. However it has been\ncareful to spend most of its new cash\non stem cell research to avoid any\npotential public outcry from people\nwho donated without realising they\nwould be supporting animal testing\nthey could be opposed to. The sheer\nvolume of donations it received\ncombined with the fact that up to\n36% of the population are opposed to\nanimal testing \u2014 and 70% don\u2019t really\nget what it entails \u2014 suggest that a\nlarge spending spree on pulling rats\napart would almost certainly result in\na negative backlash.\nALS charities now sit on pots of\ngold larger than some countries\u2019\neconomies. They may be able to hold\noff funding vivisection in the short\nterm whilst the public eye is still\non them, but they\u2019re going to have\nOld movie or new? Photo: The Artist; Studio 37, Warner Bros.; wonderlandmagazine.com\nMATT ALLINSON\nCOMMENT WRITER\nto spend it on animal experiments\neventually. And rightly so: diseases\naren\u2019t cured by pouring buckets of\nwater over celebrities.\nInstead of posing a dilemma to\nthese charities, this is now the perfect\ntime to engage with the public over\nanimal testing. The charities should\npublicly promote all their different\ntypes of research \u2014 including their\nanimal models \u2014 and describe how\nthese tie in to other human based\nstudies. More effort could be made to\ndiscuss the strict ethical frameworks\nthat surround animal testing with the\npublic, as well as the efforts made to\nprevent unnecessary suffering, and\nthe current research that\u2019s taking\nplace to do away with animal models\nentirely.\nThe goodwill that ALS research\nis currently experiencing is\nunprecedented and could prove the\nperfect backdrop to increase the\nunderstanding of animal research\nthat the public both wants, and is\nowed.\nIt was the sort of sunny afternoon\nwhen girls put on floral skirts\nand pin their hair up. As I\nfloppily moved my mouse to click\non a link someone had just shared,\nmy eyes widened. It was a list called\n\u201cUpcoming Movies 2015\u201d, and\nthere were many names that made\nmy heart leap in familiarity. I saw\nSpongeBob, Cinderella, Peanutws,\nStar Wars, and loads of other old\nfriends who suddenly look back at\nme from the foreseeable future. My\nfirst thought: 2015 is going to be a\nfun year. Second thought: are people\nstarting to appreciate old movies\nmore and more?\nAccording to my observation, the\nanswer is yes. From the current\nHalloween hit movie, Annabelle, to\nlast year\u2019s Hitchcockian production\nTwo Faces of January, a retro wind is\nobviously blowing strong. Besides\nthe cinematic retro trend, people\nare trying to watch old movies by\nthemselves, though these are less\nhandy than the new ones in cinemas.\nImperial\u2019s Filmsoc is also dedicated to\nshowing some \u201cOldies but Goodies\u201d.\nI myself could not believe it when I\nwatched 12 Angry Men, a black-and-white movie, the whole way through\nwithout looking at my watch, but I\ndid it. And I still remember bumping\ninto a stranger who suddenly started\ntalking, all excited, about an ancient\nChinese action movie in which people\nstill yell \u201cyoooohoooo\u201d before making\nany move.\nWhy do modern people start paying\nattention to movies of the past, or\nof distant cultures? An escape from\nreality fueled by availability of\nresources, I first thought. The word\nretro, as explained in Wikipedia,\nmeans not just nostalgia, but\nnostalgia with a hint of cynicism.\nPeople are trying to get away from\nthe reality of films, The satisfaction\nfrom all the fancy special effects has\nreached its peak, and more often\neffects just bore the audience out of\ntheir mind. Also, there are claims\nthat developing film technology\nis rendering actors lazy and\nincompetent. People have come to a\ndead end; they have nowhere to go.\nIt\u2019s hard to technologically bring the\ncinematic experience to a new level.\nThat was all I thought, until a recent\nconversation changed my mind.\nThe growing retro taste in film does\nnot only reflect disappointment\ntowards modern filmmaking. It is a\ngood thing too. It is an indication of\nhow people think of films. People\nare refusing to just accept what the\ncinema has to offer and becoming the\nselectors of what they watch. They\nare striving to make different films,\nto uproot themselves and plunge\nthemselves into another generation\nor culture, because they expect more\nthan fun from the movies they\nwatch. People are asking the popcorn\nentertainment to bite back at them,\nand leave a mark. This is another\nway of showing what matters most\nin films is always the story. A good\nstory wins and the victory lasts.\nResearch Ethics at the Bottom of the Ice Bucket\nAre people starting to enjoy old movies more?\nCharity fads raise money for animal testing, but should the public\nshould be better informed?\nBearing this in mind, the next time I\nsee a retro movie in cinema, instead\nof yearning and mocking, \u201cgahh\nthey\u2019ve run out of ideas\u201d, I would\ngive a thumbs up to everyone. We\nare still seeking good stories, and the\nfilmmakers, are trying hard to give us\nwhat we seek.\nMuni Wen ponders the revival of retro in modern cinema\n\n"

I\u2019m worried about\nletting everyone down. What\nshould I do?\nOverwhelmed in Oxford Street\nFirst, let\u2019s have a look at what\nhappens if you don\u2019t stop. The\npressure from all sides will keep piling\nup, and something is going to have\nto give. You might manage to keep\non going, not doing a satisfactory job\nfor anything, and just about scrape\nthrough your exams. You might\nconcentrate too much on clubs and\nfail your exams. Or you might crack,\ndecide to curl up in a ball for a week\nor two and ignore everything. None of\nthese options are great, so you need to\nchange something.\nThough you may not like the\nidea, the best thing for you, and\nprobably everyone in general would\nbe to give up one, or some, of your\ncommitments. Try and figure out\nwhich one would be the best equipped\nwithout you. Did someone run\nagainst you in the election who could\ntake over and give you a break? And\ndon\u2019t worry about delegating some\nof your tasks. Everyone finds it a bit\noverwhelming at times, and there\nwill be people around who can take\nsome of the work, you just need to\nremember to ask.\nJust make sure to keep going to your\nlectures, and don\u2019t forget to revise.\nClubs can be some of the best parts\nof uni life, but you\u2019re here for the\ndegree and sometimes you need to\nremember that.\nHelp! My girlfriend has just told\nme that she is going to apply for\na PhD in America. We\u2019ve been\ntogether for over a year, and\neverything has been going great,\nbut I\u2019m really worried about what\ngoing long distance is going to do\nfor our relationship. I don\u2019t want\nto stop her from doing what she\nwants to do, but surely a bit of\nconsultation wouldn\u2019t have gone\namiss?\nWorried in Westminster\nThe very short answer to this is\nsimple: talk.\nIt\u2019s not hard to talk to someone,\nespecially when you spend a\nlot of time with them. Good\ncommunication is one of the most\nimportant things for a healthy\nrelationship, and it seems like maybe\nneither of you have been doing this as\nmuch as you might need to.\nGoing abroad for a few years is a big\nstep to take, and can have a massive\nimpact on a relationship. Should\nshe have told you about this before\nnow? Probably. But there might be a\nreason that she hasn\u2019t. Perhaps she\nwas worried about your reaction? If\nso, strangely enough, the solution is\nprobably to talk to her. Let her know\nif you\u2019re okay with her going; letting\nher know that she has your support\nwill make things much easier. Let her\nknow what you worried about, and\nAgony Aunt Annie Whiteley is the woman who fought for women\u2019s cloakroom facilities at Imperial,\nand thus is qualiied to solve all your problems.\nHello all, Aunt Annie is back to help.

We\u2019ve also\nbrought back lonely hearts this week to see if we can help some of you lonely Imperialites ind love.\nmake sure that you discuss where you\nstand.\nLong distance is a big commitment\nthat can be pretty difficult to deal\nwith, and you need to make sure that\nit\u2019s what you both want to do. Just\ndon\u2019t worry, talk about it, and things\nmight work out much better than you\nthink.\nHelp! I\u2019ve been hanging out with\nthis guy on the floor below me in\nhalls. We\u2019ve been texting all the\ntime, and I want to take things\nfurther, but he just doesn\u2019t seem\nto get the hint. How do get him to\nmake a move?\nWaiting in Wilkinson\nThis is not the first time that I\u2019ve\ndealt with this problem, and I\nreally doubt that it will be the last.\nHopefully you, and everyone reading\nthis, will get the message. It\u2019s quite\nsimple. Just because you are a girl,\ndoesn\u2019t mean that you can\u2019t make\nthe first move. I continue to find it\namazing that so many people just\ndon\u2019t seem to realise this. You think\nyou\u2019re scared? You know what, so is\nhe.\nIt might be traditional for the male\nto make the first move, but this is\njust stupid. Everyone can go up to\nsomeone and say \u2018Hey, I like you, let\u2019s\ngo for a drink\u2019. If you are too much\nof a wimp to do it in person, send the\nsame thing in a text. It won\u2019t look\nquite as good as doing it in person,\nbut at least you\u2019ve done something,\nwhich is better than sitting and\naround and waiting.\nOr maybe there is a reason that\nLonely Hearts\nhe hasn\u2019t made a move yet, and he\njust isn\u2019t interested in being more\nthat friends. In that case, you get\nrejected, get a bit upset, and move\non. And hopefully you\u2019ll have learnt\nsomething. Don\u2019t let men be the only\nones to be rejected, that just isn\u2019t fair.\nHelp! My roommate is gay, and\nwhile I\u2019m happy to be friends with\nsomeone gay, I feel uncomfortable\nwith sharing a room with him. I\nfeel really vulnerable when I\u2019m\ngetting changed in the same room\nas him, like he\u2019s eyeing me up as a\npiece of meat. I know I\u2019m probably\nbeing paranoid, but it really\nbothers me. What should I do?\nParanoid in Park Royal\nThe truth is, you probably are just\nbeing paranoid. You don\u2019t fancy every\ngirl you see, and he feels the same way\nabout most guys.\nHowever you do have a point. There\nis a reason that we don\u2019t have co-ed\nrooms, and it\u2019s not because boys are\nicky. Many females wouldn\u2019t feel\ncomfortable getting changed in front\nof a male, roommate or not, and it\u2019s\nsort of the same situation for you.\nWhat you probably shouldn\u2019t do it\nbring it up. He\u2019ll feel like you are\naccusing him of being a bit of a perve,\nand that ain\u2019t great for roommate\nbliss. If it\u2019s really bothering you, try\nand get changed in the room when\nhe\u2019s not there. Or you could get\nchanged in the shower rather than\ncoming back to your room in a towel.\nOf course, if he actually eyeing you\nup, you might want to have a chat\nwith someone in your halls, because\nthat isn\u2019t really okay.\nHelp! We got assigned our lab\npartners for this year last week,\nand though we get on pretty well,\nhe just isn\u2019t pulling his weight.\nHe\u2019ll ask me to meet up with him\nto discuss lab reports but I feel like\nI\u2019m the only one contributing to\nthe conversation, and he just uses\nmy hard work to make his own life\neasier. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair, but\nI don\u2019t want to bring it up in case\nit makes things awkward, as we do\nhave to work together for the rest\nof the year. What should I do?\nAnnoyed in Acton\nThere isn\u2019t much point in not\nbringing it up. If you don\u2019t, there is a\ngood chance that you might just start\nresenting him for not doing enough\nwork. Resentment will lead to snarky\ncomments and before you know it\nyou won\u2019t be able to do anything\nwithout making a comment about it.\nIt\u2019s better to get it all out in the open\nnow before the resentment has time\nto build.\nIf you don\u2019t want to mention it\nto him, try a different approach.\nWhy not control the direction of\nthe conversation, ask him questions\nabout the work you\u2019ve been doing\nrather than offering him answers\non a plate? If he can\u2019t answer, he\u2019ll\nprobably feel awkward, and hopefully\ndo more next week. Or discuss\nwhat you\u2019re both going to research\nbeforehand. That way you can both\ncontribute, and if he hasn\u2019t done the\nwork you have more reason to be\nupset.\nDesperate Deputy\nPresident seeks\nexotic beauty, to\nshare noodles,\nsake and UKIP\nbanter.

Ben proposed that\nthe Council should \u201cpublish\nvoting records in order to be truly\ndemocratic,\u201d which proved to be\na contentious issue with those in\nattendance.\nWith the Council Chair unable to\nreach a definitive conclusion of how\nmany people were for or against the\nmotion, it was suggested that students\nstand to either side of the room to\nphysically show just exactly where\nthey \u201cstood.\u201d\nThe motion to introduce\npublication of the voting records was\nfinally rejected, although a working\ngroup has now been organised\nto investigate the feasibility of\nintroducing electronic systems to\nrecord voting anyway.\nSaid Ben Fernando, the man\nbehind the movement (literally and\nfiguratively), \u201cIt\u2019s nice to see that the\nissue of how the Council votes is being\npublicised, even if you\u2019re making fun\nof us. Hopefully people read this and\nwonder why they can\u2019t go online and\nfind out how their representatives\nhave voted!\u201d\nOne Union representative present\ntold Felix \u201cIt was a farce; I attend\ncouncil to sit and nod off, not to have\nto physically move from one side of\nthe room to another.\u201d\nThe council also decided to strip\nthe Executive Committee of its\npowers. Although the functions of\nthe committee are yet to be formally\nreviewed, since a lot of what is\ndecided by the committee is also\nwithin the remit of the day-to-day\nroles of Sabbaticals and paid union\nstaff members, it was decided to have\nno members, have no function and no\nlonger meet.\nThe Executive Committee was\npreviously made up of the Sabbaticals,\nConstituent Union representatives,\nand four members of council. They\ncould previously oversee the financial\nchanges, but this was stripped from\ntheir remit when Paul Beaumont,\nthen Union President, revised the\nConstitution.\nPhilippa Skett describes the \u201caction\u201d as recorded votes motion is debated\nWhat is council?\nConsidered the\u201chackiest\u201dmeeting\nin the Union calendar,Union\nCouncil meets roughly once a\nmonth.Council is open to all\nstudents to attend,but only those\nelected with a seat in Council\ncan stand and be counted when\nmaking decisions.\nStudents can take papers that\nthose in council then vote on,and\nthe changes are put into practice as\na result.\nAny student can take a paper\nto council,but most of those\nsubmitted are by the Sabbaticals\nor other members of Council.\nThe Sabbatical Oficers also\nproduce reports that people can\nquestion,and have to vote to\naccept.\nThose who can vote include\nFaculty representatives,\nConstituent Union representatives,\nand those elected in the council\nelections that took place last week.\nThe Council is run entirely by\nstudents,and no members of\nstaff from the Union are allowed\nto attend except those that take\nthe minutes.The current Council\nChair,Paul Beaumont,was Union\nPresident two years ago.\nThe Union Council describes itself\nas\u201cin effect the democratic voice\nof the student body,\u201dalthough\nthis should not be confused with\nFelix,the\u201cstudent voice of Imperial\nCollege London.\u201d\nThe Singaporean President\nTony Tan Keng Yam came\nto visit Imperial College\nLondon last Friday. Singapore forms\none the College\u2019s largest groups of\ninternational students. Recently\nImperial launched joint medical\nschool with Singapore and a new\nPhenome research centre. This\nweek a new cybersecurity research\nagreement has been signed.\nPresident Tan visited the\nCarbon Capture Pilot Plant, where\nacademics, students and industrial\npartners test and develop new ways\nof capturing and harnessing CO2\nemissions before they can harm the\nplanet.\nSpeaking at a State Banquet\nfor President Tan, the Queen\nsaid, \u201cToday Imperial College is\nhelping to train a new generation\nof Singaporean doctors, just one of\nmany important partnerships that\nit and other UK universities are\nbuilding with Singapore.\u201d\nThe practical aspects of the\nSingaporean President\u2019s visit\ncame apparent when the Sherfield\nWalkway and Dalby Court were\nsealed off. Confused students had\nto wait patiently whilst a large\ncontingent of Metropolitan Police\nOfficers searched the courtyard for\nany signs of explosives of weapons.\nSniffer dogs were also out in force,\nwith at least two seen checking the\ncampus. Frustrations grew as the\nminutes ticked by with students\nand staff alike forced to wait for the\nPresident to arrive, shake hands with\nstudents, and leave so Imperial could\ncontinue with their routines.\nA momentary lapse in security\ncaused a panic when the President\nwas meeting students on Dalby\nCourt. A student managed to walk\nthrough the Bessemer entrance and\nthrough to the ramp down to the\nQueen\u2019s Tower Lawn. At this point,\nCollege Security chased after him\nand secured him. Whilst they were\ntelling him off, the lack of security\nat other door entrances meant other\nmembers of the College patiently\nwaiting decided to try their luck\nand walk through. Chaos ensued\nas Security then tried to stop more\nstudents from entering Dalby Court.\nImperial\u2019s student body has 400\nfull-time Singaporean students in\naddition to many more exchange\nstudents.\nProfessor Alice Gast, President of\nImperial College London, serves on\nthe Academic Research Council of\nSingapore.\nProfessor Gast said, \u201cWe are\nhonoured to welcome President\nTan to Imperial, as we celebrate the\nCollege\u2019s rich history of collaboration\nwith Singapore. President Tan\u2019s\nfirm commitment to excellence in\nresearch and higher education is\nhelping us to build on these strong\nfoundations as our relationship\ndevelops.\u201d\nThis is the second time that a Head\nof State has visited the College in the\nlast twelve months. In November\n2013 the President of South Korea,\nPark Geun-hye, visited the College.\nPresident Tan greets students in Dalby Court Photo: Benjamin Lester from Through Ben's Lens\n\n"

    "content": "26 THE STUDENT PAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON FELIX\n31.10.2014\nFilm\nilm.felix@imperial.ac.uk Film Editors Ellen Mathieson, John Park & Jack Steadman\nCreatures of the Night\nJack Steadman goes on a nightly stroll with Jake Gyllenhaal\nPhoto: nerdist\nNightcrawler starts off\ninnocently enough, with\nclassic shots of the LA skyline\nat night, millions of lights fending\noff the darkness, before crashing\ndown to a man cutting through a\nwire fence. A police car pulls up,\nrevealing the face of Lou Bloom (Jake\nGyllenhaal). Gaunt \u2013 unnervingly so\n\u2013 Gyllenhaal is an instantly magnetic\nscreen presence. A twitching bundle\nof nervous energy, speaking in a\nhigh-pitched, nasal patter, his Bloom\nis the vehicle for Nightcrawler\u2019s story,\nthe tale of a man driven to succeed,\na man who uses the vapid, bland\nlanguage of \u2018management speak\u2019 to\njustify his every action, regardless of\nthe morality \u2013 or otherwise \u2013 of the\nsituation.\nIt\u2019s that absurd contrast \u2013 the use\nof everyday, borderline meaningless\nterminology in the fact of actions\nfar beyond ordinary situations \u2013\nthat lends the film a large swathe of\nits dark humour, as well as the key\nthrust of its satire. The rest of the\nhumour is found in Bloom\u2019s bluntless\nin romantic matters, as he avoids\nany sense of tact when dealing with\nRene Russo\u2019s TV producer Nina. This\nisn\u2019t a comedy, by any stretch of the\nimagination \u2013 it\u2019s quite the opposite\n\u2013 but laughter still slips through the\ncracks.\nNightcrawler is most definitely a\nsatire, however, albeit not the one\nyou\u2019d expect. Dealing as it does with\nthe freelance \u2018journalists\u2019 running\naround with video cameras in L.A.\nat night (the titular \u2018nightcrawlers\u2019),\nfilming the results of crimes and\naccidents and selling the tapes to\nthe news, there\u2019s a lot of room to\nmaneouvre when it comes to taking\npotshots at the press. To the film\u2019s\ncredit, while it takes its fair share\nof swipes in that general direction,\nit also opens fire on the culture of\nbusiness. Bloom\u2019s sole aim \u2013 his\nentire purpose \u2013 is to be in charge\nof his own, successful business.\nEverything he does, everything he\nsays, all is in the name of achieving\nthat goal, morality be damned; which\nNIGHTCRAWLER\nDirector: Dan Gilroy\nScreenplay: Dan Gilroy\nCast: Jake Gyllenhaal, Rene\nRusso, Bill Paxton\nis partially why he\u2019s so terrifying.\nDespite the sheer amoral\nmalevolence that Bloom radiates,\nthe film manages what should be\nimpossible, twisting the audience\u2019s\nsympathies until you actively want\nBloom to succeed. The score by\nJames Newton Howard is among\nthe main culprits for this successful\nmanipulation \u2013 never too intrusive,\nalways simmering in the background,\nit subtly toys with traditionally\nheroic themes as Bloom succeeds,\nquietly suggesting something more\nthan the obvious scorn and fear the\ncharacter deserves.\nThe sheer number of times Bloom\u2019s\nname has already appeared should be\nsome indication as to how vital he is\nto the film \u2013 and through that, how\nessential Gyllenhaal\u2019s performance is.\nIt is an utterly transcendent showing,\neasily the best performance of his\ncareer so far. It is a Robert de Niro in\nTaxi Driver for the modern day, with\nstrands of de Niro\u2019s performance\nin King of Comedy, and it deserves\nall of the praise and Oscar buzz it\u2019s\ngetting. It is not an obvious contender\n\u2013 very much the dark horse of the\ncontest \u2013 but don\u2019t be surprised to see\nGyllenhaal\u2019s name on more than a\nfew shortlists come awards season.\nWhen it comes to bringing up\nthe de Niro/Scorcese films and\nNightcrawler\u2019s obvious heritage in that\ndepartment, it\u2019s worth noting that the\nfilm can\u2019t escape other comparisons\nto the past, not least to fellow L.A.based Drive (it certainly shares a love\nof the grimy, the claustrophobic, the\ndark, seedy side of the city), but it\nstill manages to rise above the risk of\nappearing solely derivative, instead\nbecoming something so much more.\nCredit for this must almost\ncertainly go in no small part to writer/\nfirst-time director Dan Gilroy, a\nman previously responsible for the\nscreenplay/story for the likes of\nThe Bourne Legacy and Real Steel:\nnothing particularly terrible, but\nnothing \u2013 nothing \u2013 quite like this.\nIt\u2019s a confident debut, utilising all the\ntricks of the trade, and still finding\nroom for minor innovations to ensure\nthe film never slows down or feels\nold. There\u2019s a vast array of glorious\nshots, occasional flashes of symbolism\nthat demand this film be rewatched,\nstudied, dissected. Not something you\ncould say about Real Steel.\nThere\u2019s a lot more to be said about\nNightcrawler. The supporting cast\nare universally excellent, but all\nso overshadowed by Gyllenhaal\nthat it\u2019s hard to pick one out. The\ncinematography is perfect, oozing\nsleaze and grime in every shot, but\nit all comes back to the leading\nperformance, and the writer/\ndirector behind it. This is Gilroy and\nGyllenhaal\u2019s moment. And if this\nshould prove to be another Scorcese/\nde Niro style partnership, long may it\ncontinue.\nANNABELLE\nDirector: John R. Leonetti\nScreenplay: Gary Dauberman\nCast: Annabelle Wallis, Ward\nHorton, Alfre Woodard\nJOHN PARK\nSECTION EDITOR\nWhy someone in their right\nmind would want to take\nhome a doll that looks\nlike Annabelle is anyone\u2019s guess.\nBut Mia (Annabelle Wallis) cannot\nseem to contain her joy when her\ndoctor husband John (Ward Horton)\nsurprises her with this new addition\nto her doll collection. But one night,\nthe couple is attacked in a home\ninvasion attempt by a pair of violent\nlunatic cult members. The police get\nthere on time, a remarkable rarity\nin horror films \u2013 or in any film\nfor that matter, the intruders are\nkilled, after which the doll ends up\npossessed by an evil demonic spirit\n(even the demon knows which sinister\nlooking toy to go for when it decides\nto hang around) of the female cult\nmember named Annabelle, and it is\nall downhill from there for the once\nhappy couple.\nAs is usually the case with\ndemons, there is a whole host of\nweird and wonderful things that\nstart happening. As the young\nmother begins to struggle with\nthe supernatural haunting of her\nhouse, the doctor husband who is\nsupportive but hardly ever home and\nmisses much of the action, thinks\nshe is unwell, and advises rest and a\nprofessional to speak with.\nGranted, there are some spooky\nmoments that work well. It helps that\nthe doll itself is quite the disturbing\nlooking creation, and especially when\nit starts doing its own evil things the\nterror that mounts up momentarily is\neffective.\nIt is a shame, however, that\nAnnabelle herself does not take the\ninitiative to start killing everyone\naround her like Chuky did in Child\u2019s\nPlay.\nA young girl and an older woman,\nboth dressed in ragged, bloody sheets\njust will not leave Mia alone. There\nappears to be something rising from\nthe darkness, a powerful force of\ndarkness whose strength is getting\nbigger every day. It is all familiar\nstuff, but the scares do remain the\nhighlight of The Conjuring prequel.\nThe trouble is that there simply\nare not enough for it to sustain\nthe running time, even though the\nfilm only runs for 99 minutes. It is\nparticularly disappointing to see such\nan uneventful finale using appalling\nsupporting characters who randomly\ngo in and out of the protagonists\u2019\nlives.\nThe worst written role here is\nEvelyn\u2019s (Alfre Woodard). As a wiser,\nolder lady, she gives useful advice,\nonly to throw it all away in the end by\nbeing literally tossed aside. Woodard\ngives the film its much needed\nemotional core, but her scenes never\nfollow through to amount to anything\nspecial.\nVery little makes sense in the end,\nnot that you would expect a horror\nfilm to have much logic running\nthrough in its script, but with\nAnnabelle, the sheer lack of coherence\nis too significant to ignore.\nPhoto: flickeringmyth Photo: ign\nPhoto: yellmagazine\n\n"

For example,\nNSS (National Student Survey)\nresult (2014) for \"assessment and\nfeedback\" was 124th in the HE\nsector.\nP: That was one of my manifesto\npoints. However, with improving\nfeedback, you can\u2019t definitively\npinpoint when feedback improves,\nthe outcome may only be seen in\na few years\u2019 time, when student\nsatisfaction results improve.\nB: I've heard that different\nacademic departments at Imperial\nmake different kinds of mistakes\nevery year. But the mistakes\nseem to be consistent for each\ndepartment.\nWould it not be better to\nintegrate the faculties so that all\nthe problems are solved?\nP: We can\u2019t do that because every\ndepartment is autonomous. It has\nbenefits, because every department\ngenerally finds what works best for\nitself. One of the issues of integrating\nall faculties would be to do with\nstandardising.\nB: What other manifesto points did\nyou have?\nP: One was to improve e-learning,\nto provide lecture recordings (the\ncompletion of this aim is more\ntangible) and maybe extend it to\nMassive Open Online Courses\n(MOOCs).\nThe other manifesto point was\nto integrate with the postgrad\npopulation of Imperial, because of\nImperial\u2019s large postgrad population\n(55%undergrads, 45%postgrads).\nB: Why do you not think the\npostgrads are as engaged?\nP: Extracurricular activities are less\nimportant for postgrads, their main\npriority is their research. They tend\nto view being involved in the student\nUnion as extra workload and tend to\nsee their CV benefits less.\n\n"

Now was this a clever hint\ndropped by Ryan Murphy and Brad\nFalchuk, the creators of the American\nHorror Story anthology, subtly\ndirecting us all to the next season, or\nwas this nothing more than a freakish\ncoincidence? We will never truly\nknow, but the American Horror Story\nseries, now in its fourth season, aptly\nnamed Freak Show, is as twisted and\ndeliriously entertaining packed full of\nover the top characters and storylines\nthat open themselves up for all sorts\nof shocks and reveals.\nAs the title suggests, the fourth\nseason takes place in Elsa Mars\u2019\n(Jessica Lange) very own freak\nshow, a rundown circus that\nattracts locals who basically come\nto laugh and marvel at the circus\ncast of individuals with all sorts of\ndeformities. Her latest headlining act\nis a pair of conjoined twins Bette and\nDot (both played by Sarah Paulson),\nthe kind of attraction no one has\never seen before. Of the existing\nmembers, we have Ethel (Kathy\nBates) the bearded lady, her son\nJimmy (Evan Peters) with syndactyly,\nas well as some new entries to the\ncircus tent, including strong man\nDell Toledo (Michael Chiklis), his\nnew wife Desiree (Angela Bassett)\nwho has three breasts instead of the\nmore traditional two, and the newest\nmember to the group, fortune-teller\nMaggie Esmeralda (Emma Roberts)\nwho is actually a fraud with ulterior\nmotives, as is the case with most\npeople around this place.\nWhat happens during one of\ntheir performances is the least of\nthe show\u2019s most troubling aspect.\nIn fact the big singing numbers,\nmasterfully done by Lange and\nPaulson are really quite something.\nWhat takes place outside the freak\nshow is more sickening. There is\na serial killer clown on the loose,\nplayed chillingly by John Carroll\nLynch, who goes around terrorising\nthe town of Jupiter, Florida. Dandy\nMott (Finn Wittrock) is a grown man\nwho acts like a spoiled child, with his\nrich mother Gloria (Frances Conroy)\ncondoning even the worst aspects\nof his psychotic behaviour. Stanley\n(Denis O\u2019Hare) possesses a 13-inch\npenis;what he plans on doing with it\nhas not been answered yet.\nIt certainly boasts an impressive\ncast, and the award-winning\nindividuals are once again on\ntop form. Lange sports a tough\nGerman accent to play the owner,\ncreating another fascinating, unique\ncharacter, which shows that this\nseries has been one of the best things\nto happen to her career. Paulson is\nparticularly strong this season, and\nshe is an early serious contender for\nthe Best Actress Emmy. The creation\nof the conjoined twins too marks one\nhell of a technical achievement for\nthe anthology. The different camera\nangles, and splitting of camera\nscreens at the right time show the\naudience the different fields of vision\nfor both Bette and Dot.\nGet ready for blood: lots of it. The\nshow has never been known for\nsubtlety, nor does it ever hold back\non gruesome images or body counts,\nand this season is no different. In fact,\nit has the opportunity to become the\nmost shocking yet.\nSet in 1952, the bigotry and hate\ntowards the circus people are alive\nand well, and it would appear the\nshow has a stance on that. \u2018Freaks\u2019,\nor so the townspeople call them,\nmuch to the circus performers\u2019 anger\nand annoyance, are people too, and\ndeserve the same level of respect and\nrights as anyone else. Sound familiar?\nThat message was embedded into the\nplots of Asylum and Coven, the show\u2019s\nprevious two seasons. It is clearly\nan issue that is close to Murphy\u2019s\nheart. This incessant repetition may\nbe an eye-rolling factor for some,\nbut when there are so many other\nthings going on, delivered in such\nan unpredictable setting, even the\nslowest scenes become bearable.\nThere is still plenty left for the\nremaining episodes to explore, with\nmore famous names joining the cast.\nLet the show commence.\nPhoto: huffingtonpost\nPhoto: fansided\nPhoto: decider\nPhoto: vixenvarsity\nPhoto: nydailynews\n\n"

The competing\nteams were the Atlanta Falcons,\nwho sacrificed a game at their home\nstadium to travel over here, and\nthe Detroit Lions. The first half of\nthe game was a great start for the\nFalcons, who finished the half with\na 21 point lead, however the game\nturned in the second half and came\ndown to the last 4 seconds when the\nLions kicked a field goal to win by a\nscore of 22-21. This was the second\nof three NFL games being played\nat Wembley this year \u2013 the most\nAmerican Football games to be\nplayed in the UK during one season.\nThe possibility of having a Londonbased NFL team has beenmootedby\nvarious people sincetheNFL\u2019s\nfirstforay into Wembley in 2007,but\nthe idea has been revived recently\nafter George Osborne told NFL\nofficials that the UK government\nwouldsupport any plans tostart\nanNFL London franchise. This is an\nincredibly excitingprospectfor the\n2 million plusNFLfans who live in\nthe UK. But American Football teams\nare not cheap to run when based on\nUS soil, never mind the added cost of\nbeing located across the Atlantic.\nIn order to explore the likelihood\nof permanent NFL success in\nLondon,itisworthconsideringthe\nattendance statistics for the games.\nThe past fivegames at Wembley\nhave reached attendances ofmore\nthan83,000,with the number set\nto increase for the final game of\nthis year,on 9 November, whenthe\nJacksonville Jaguars take on the\nDallas Cowboys,arguably the most\ninternationally well-known team in\nthe league.\nClearly there is a strong enough\nfollowing for a team on this side of\nthe pond but whether the attendance\nwould remain this highifAmerican\nFootball at Wembley became a\nregular occurrencefor a full seasonis\nadifficultquestion to answer. Having\nbeen to games myself, my bet would\nbe that it would continue to attract a\nlarge crowd,since UK NFL fans are\ndedicated to the game asawhole, not\njust oneparticularteam.\nFurthermore,the enthusiasm\nand interaction with the crowd\nat American Football games (and\nindeed all American sports games\nI have attended) createstheoverall\nexperience of acompleteday out\nwith entertainment from gymnasts,\nmascots, cheerleaders and acts during\nhalf-time,not just watching the\nplayersand the game itself.\nIncentives like free flags and\nt-shirts give even those who have no\nidea about the game the opportunity\nto feel involved and get the sense of\nbelonging to a team.\nThe financial side oftheNFL\nwill no doubt be the driving force\nin whether plans foraLondon-based team will come to fruition.\nThe broadcasterESPN pays$1.9\nbillionper yearfor the right to show\nNFL games whilst BSkyB signed\nanewfive-year deal in September\nto ensure theyretainthe major\nbroadcasting rights in the UK. The\nfact that this contract was signed\nproves that businesses also see the\npotential for the NFL UK market.\nIndeed, this could help shorten the\npredicted wait times for American\nfootball in the UK. Arthur Blank,\nowner oftheAtlanta Falcons, has\nsuggestedthe NFL London franchise\nis only six or seven years away from\nbecoming a reality,but with major\ncompanies pushingtheNFL in the\nright direction for UK audiences,it\ncould be sooner\nMany people have suggested that\nan NFL team in London would create\ntoo much of problem in terms of\nlogistics. According to the Falcons,\nthey flew 221 people over4210 miles\nacross the globe and we can assume a\nsimilar number of people for Detroit\nIf an NFL team were to be based\nin London,the equipment would\nremain in the team base but transport\nfor team and staff would still be a\nnecessity.When asked about this,\nArthur Blanklooked to teams from\nSan Diego and Seattle as examples\nof long distance travel not being too\nmuch ofan issue for NFL teams at\npresent. Admittedly,the east coast\nof the US is closer to the west coast\nthanit isto the UK,but there are still\nsignificant amounts of travel and\ntime zone changesrequired as it is.\nIt was also suggested that games\nwould be played in blocks similar to\nthose in baseball matches, where the\nLondon-based team would play three\ngames at home and then three games\nin theUS, reducing the expense.\nUltimately, it appears that the\nfoundations for an NFL London\nteam are rock solid. The fan base\nexists and is substantial enough to\nsell an adequate amount of tickets\nfor it to work. There is support\nfrom influential sources like the\nUKgovernment,and NFL teams are\nwilling to travel to London to play\ngames. NFL officials are hoping\nfor another surge in fans to boost\nattendances even more,so it is likely\nthere will be many more games at\nWembley over the next few years.\nCheck it out if you get the chance \u2013\nit\u2019s an experience you won\u2019t forget!\nPhoebe Hunter discusses of the possibility of a permanent team at Wembley\nThe Jaguars return to Wembley next week Photo: Neil Barnes\n\n"

    "content": "THE STUDENT PAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON 29\n31.10.2014\nFELIX\nTelevision Television Editors Guila Gabrielli & John Park\ntelevision.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nWhere the hell did this come from?\nDan Harmon\u2019s beloved sitcom\nCommunity has long been\nknown to fans as a \u2018genre\u2019\nshow smuggled onto our screens\nunder the disguise of a regular\ncomedy about a community college.\nIn Adult Swim cartoon Rick and\nMorty, co-creator Dan Harmon has\ndone the opposite \u2013 he\u2019s managed\nto smuggle an earnest, real family\ndrama out to us under the disguise\nof a wacky, high-concept sci-fi\nadventure series.\nI\u2019ll prove it. Here\u2019s two versions of\nthe premise:\n1. Rick is a genius scientist who\ngoes on exciting, dimension-hopping\nadventures with his reluctant teenage\ngrandson Morty.\n2. Beth is a woman with an on-the-rocks marriage to the guy who\nknocked her up at prom. One day, her\nestranged, deadbeat dad (who happens\nto be a genius scientist) shows up at\nher door asking to live with her. After\nshe agrees he becomes somewhat of\na surrogate father to her teenage son,\nMorty, much to the chagrin of his\nactual dad.\nIf \u201cRick the scientist, Morty\nthe teenager\u201d sounds familiar, it\nshould. The show began its life as an\n(incredibly lewd) internet cartoon\nshort called Doc and Marty, in yet\nanother parody of the famous Back to\nthe Future duo. Knowing that helps to\nput the show in its context, and shed\nlight on the exact conversation it\u2019s\nhaving with nerd culture.\nThe brilliance of Rick and Morty is\nin how it seems to exist in a quantum\nsuperposition of the two premises.\nObviously \u2018using sci-fi adventures to\ntalk about real relationships\u2019 is some\nWriting 101 stuff \u2013 of course your scifi show should be grounded in human\ndrama! But the magic is in how\nnaturally it all flows. It strikes the\nperfect balance between sly winking,\nlampshading itself/various genre\ntropes, and playing those tropes just\nstraight enough to wring the human\ndrama out of it. It\u2019s never cheap. It\u2019s\nnever obvious. Every episode keeps\nyou guessing. And yet here\u2019s that\nword again, it\u2019s just so earnest.\nBut that\u2019s not to belittle the sci-fi\nelements. The show may delight\nin parodying sci-fi concepts to hell\nand back (\u201cmy grandpa\u2019s a magic\nscientist!\u201d would be the end of the\nstory in a kids\u2019 show, but being on\nAdult Swim the show has a healthy\ndose of cynicism to temper it), but\nit\u2019s clearly done from a place of love,\nand you end up with some pretty\ninteresting stuff like a Jurassic Park\nparody in the form of a theme park\nof various diseases, but miniaturised\nand inside a hobo\u2019s body.\nAll of this culminates in what is\nwithout doubt the best episode, Rixty\nMinutes. To a cynic, the premise of the\nepisode is just \u2018Rick and co. watch TV\u2019.\nAnd the fact that it\u2019s more than that\nis a testament to the strength of the\nshow. The setup is that Rick upgrades\nthe family\u2019s cable box to get channels\nfrom \u2018every dimension\u2019, and yes,\nmuch of the episode is the content of\nthose channels in the form of short\nvignettes\u2026 yet the whole escapade\nis just setup for the \u2018real\u2019 story: one\nchannel is from a dimension where\nthe parents, Beth and Jerry, aborted\nthe elder daughter, Summer, never\ngot married, and Jerry became a\nmovie star (and they see a movie he\u2019s\nin). Ouch.\nThis leads the parents to explore\nvarious dimensions where their\nlives seem to be a lot better by never\ngetting married, and leads to Summer\nlearning for the first time that they\neven considered aborting her.\nPart of the resolution is an out-of-nowhere moment of profundity\nfrom Morty, which involves him\nunexpectedly calling back to the\ntraumatic events of a previous\nepisode which involved him burying\na dead duplicate of himself, finally\nremarking: \u201cNobody exists on\npurpose; nobody belongs anywhere;\neverybody\u2019s gonna die. Come watch\nTV.\u201d\nThis is all to say nothing of the\nvignettes themselves, all of which\nwere ad-libbed in their entirety by\nthe writers. This is rare in animation.\nUsually by the time voice recording\nTom Rivlin looks at Rick and Morty in the Cartoon Corner\n\"Nobody\nbelongs\nanywhwere;\neverybody's\ngonna\ndie. Come\nwatch TV. \"\n\"My\ngrandpa's\na magic\nscientist!\"\nstarts the storyboards are finalised\nand animation has begun, leaving\nlittle \u2018wiggle room\u2019 for improv.\nHere, clearly the storyboards\nwere drawn around the improv\nsessions, a difficult feat. The results\nspeak for themselves. Each vignette\nis weird, free-flowing, creative\nand totally hilarious. Some are\ndownright Lovecraftian, or perhaps\nCronenbergian, as Rick would put it.\nThe incredible thing about Rick and\nMorty is that this is all done in only\neleven 22-minute episodes in the\nfirst season. Already (but really, from\nthe start) the show has found a clear\nvoice/tone, has a message to say and\nknows just how to say it.\nIt\u2019s returning for a second season\nthis year. Hopefully, like Community,\nit will last six seasons and a movie.\nPhoto: screenrant\nPhoto: awn Photo: watchcartoononline\n\n"

I have\nstruggled with anxiety for as long as I\ncan remember. It is no secret that I\u2019m\nknown as the stressy, anxious, over\nplanner of my circle of friends, and\nI\u2019ve been known to literally worry\nmyself sick over small disagreements\nand arguments (once in 7th\ngrade, I\nspent an entire weekend in bed with\na fever because I had had a falling out\nwith my best friend). Now, I never\nthought I had a problem,\nI just thought I took things a little\ntoo seriously, but that it was completely normal to burst into tears\nevery time someone shouted at you.\nI felt like I was just weak, that it was\na personality flaw, and that I just\nneeded to \u2018man up\u2019 (don\u2019t get me\nstarted on that phrase, that\u2019s reserved\nfor a whole different article) or grow\nout of it, but it never even occurred to\nme to ask for help or talk to someone,\nbecause I was afraid I would just get\nlaughed at, or worse, chastised for\nseeking attention or whining when\nthere was nothing really wrong. It\ndidn\u2019t even matter that much, I was\nliving at home with my parents, I was\ncoasting through school and despite\na few hiccups, I was mostly getting by\nalright.\nIt wasn\u2019t until I came to university\nthat things started getting noticeably worse. I was suddenly thrown in\nan environment where I was finally\nbeing challenged academically, and\nI\u2019m not going to lie, I was struggling\nfor the first time in my academic\ncareer. The perfectionist tendencies\nthat I\u2019d, you know, perfected, over the\npast twelve years of my academic life\nmeant that I would become paralyzed\nevery time I made a mistake or was\ngiven feedback that showed I was\nanything less than perfect (which was,\nunsurprisingly, very often).\nI had my first panic attack during\nmy 2nd\nyear programming exam. One\nmoment I was trying to code a struct\nand the next I was gripped with fear,\nwith my heart attempting to make\na hurried escape from my chest.\nNow, for those of you who\u2019ve never\nexperienced panic attacks (and I hope\nthat\u2019s most of you), it legitimately\nfeels like you\u2019re about to die.\nBreathing became difficult, I couldn\u2019t\nhear anything over the buzzing in\nmy head, there was a metallic taste in\nmy mouth, and most strangely, I felt\nlike I was watching all this happen to\nme. Nothing felt real. I would later\nfind out that this depersonalisation\nis a normal symptom of a panic\nattack but at the time, it was the most\nterrified I had ever been. I sat there\ngripping the mouse for a good twenty\nminutes, trying my hardest to just\nbreathe, before the fear started to\nsubside. By the time I could finally\nthink clearly again, there was only\nhalf an hour left to the end of the\nexam, and I rushed to finish all that\nI could, trying to hold back my tears\nenough to see what I was doing. The\nmoment we were allowed to leave, I\nbolted for the bathroom, had a good\ncry, and then went on with the rest of\nmy day, still frazzled but not saying a\nword to anyone.\nMy biggest mistake that day was\nnot going straight to my academic\ntutor and telling him what had\nhappened, but I just didn\u2019t think that\nI could. What would I say? That I had\nsuddenly gone into some trance and\ncouldn\u2019t do my exam? I had no idea\nwhat a panic attack was, I had never\nheard of anyone having one, or what\nit was like, so I had nothing to go on.\nI didn\u2019t think anyone would believe\nme, or worse, that they\u2019d tell me to\ngrow up and stop making excuses.\nThings only got worse after that\nfirst incident. Every time I was in a\nsimilar, stress-filled situation, I would\nfeel the familiar fear tighten its grip\non me, and I would be back to the\nwhimpering mess I was in that stuffy\ncomputer lab. It wasn\u2019t long before I\nwas dreading even going to small tests\nbecause just the thought of having a\npanic attack would send me reeling\noff the edge.\nI had trouble sleeping, I was lucky if\nI could get three hours of rest a night,\nI would snap at everyone around me,\nlie to my friends and family about\nwhat was wrong, and constantly\ntalk down to myself because I\nthought I was just being a wimp and\noverreacting to things.\nIt took almost a year before my\nboyfriend finally convinced me to\nsee a college counsellor, and when\nthat didn\u2019t work, to contact my GP,\nand that was only after I confided\nin him about just how many times\nI\u2019d considered ending my life. After\nthat first GP appointment, and the\ndiagnosis of saying I had anxiety\ndisorder that everything started\nmaking sense. I finally knew what\nwas wrong with me! There was a name\nfor what I was going through, and\nit turned out to, unfortunately, be a\nmuch more common condition than\nI could have ever imagined. Although\nthere was still a long way to go to\nrecovery, just the fact that I knew\nwhat was wrong came as a huge relief.\nI was put on a waiting list for\nCognitive Behavioral Therapy, was\nprescribed antidepressants, finally\ntold my department about everything\nthat had been happening and started\ngetting the support I so desperately\nneeded. I won\u2019t lie and say that\neverything suddenly got better, and\nthat I stopped feeling terrible and\neverything was instantaneously\ndandy; almost a year later and I still\nsometimes have to leave lectures\nin a hurry because I\u2019ve started\nhyperventilating, but now I know that\nit passes. I know that it gets better,\nno matter how permanent it feels at\nthe time, and that\u2019s enough to get me\nthrough another day.\nSo if there is anything you take\naway from this, it is that you\u2019re not\nalone, and as clich\u00e9 as this sounds, it\ndoes get better. Maybe not right away,\nmaybe not completely, and certainly\nnot linearly, but eventually, you\u2019ll\nlearn to deal and you will start to feel\nbetter.\nSo please, if you\u2019re reading this\nand think that you\u2019re going through\nsomething similar, don\u2019t make the\nsame mistake I did and wait until\nthings get catastrophic before seeking\nout help. Your well-being is the most\nimportant thing, and no one who\nmatters is going to judge you for\nasking for help. There are measures\nput in place to try and make sure we\nall get the support we need, so don\u2019t\nbe afraid to use them, and remember,\nyou\u2019re not alone!\nPhoto Credit: Sean Clark\n\n"

Have you ever\nwondered how the great masters\nlike Caravaggio and Velasquez\nwere inspired? The answers lie\nin the Royal Academy\u2019s latest\nexhibition, where you are faced\nwith works from throughout the\nlife of Giovanni Battista Moroni, a\nrelatively unknown Italian painter\nwho was able to capture the likeness\nand personality of his sitters with\napparent ease. The portraits are\ndone with such skill that they seem\nto capture precise moments in time;\nrather than simply standing in the\nroom, you are transported back to\nlate Renaissance Italy.\nThe rooms are grouped with the\ntype of sitters Moroni painted, one\nof the best being the full-length\nportraits of the aristocrats. The\nclothes worn by Italy\u2019s top class\nare beautifully portrayed, with\nextraordinary details such as lace and\npearl beads. As light reflects off the\ntaffeta skirts or velvet trousers of the\nmen and women that surround you,\nsomehow you know exactly how the\nmaterial would have felt\nOne of the brightest pieces \u2013 which\nhappens to be my personal favourite\n\u2013 is a portrait of Gian Gerolamo\nGrumelli. Aptly titled \u2018The Man in\nPink\u2019, Grumelli is shown wearing a\nSpanish-style tight-fitting jacket with\npuffed pantaloons, both beautifully\nembroidered with silver, paired with\npink stockings and shoes of the same\nvibrant shade. As your eyes adjust\nto the colour and detail, you soon\nrealize that a lot of thought had gone\nbehind his costume of choice: the\nGrumelli\u2019s coat of arms was a coral\nbranch with the motto \u201cFar from my\ntears it reddens and turns to stone\u201d; the\ncenter of the portrait culminates in a\njet-black sword resting in Grumelli\u2019s\nhand, depicting him to be a man of\naction. Next to him hangs a picture of\nhis wife at the time \u2013 Isotta Brembati\n\u2013 also dressed in a stunningly\nintricate gown. Although being\npositioned next to each other, Moroni\nillustrates how important each of\nthe characters were individually, and\nkeeps the viewers concentrated on\nthe individual figures through use of\nsimple grey stone backgrounds, each\ntailored specifically to the person\u2019s\nidentity.\nEach character has a different\ntitle and story, drawing you into\nthe politics and connections each\nperson had \u2013 sometimes with other\nindividuals hanging just across the\nroom. As you progress you find\nyourself amongst Moroni\u2019s later\nworks, which are different from the\naristocrats; rather than creating an\nelegant air they capture the real life\nof the person. The use of tone differs\nwith a limited palette of colours\nused, offset with only a small vibrant\nportion of bright hue. As the portraits\nstare mysteriously out at you, we\nare compelled to know more about\nthem, with the context adding to the\nexperience.\nThis well-crafted exhibition shows\nAmong the cultural highlights on\nthe calender for next year, one sticks\nout as a particular oddity: March\n2015 will see the grand opening of\nThe National Videogame Arcade\nin Nottingham. The \u00a32.5 million\nproject, which aims to become a draw\nfor tourists visiting Nottingham,\nwill be the first of its kind, aining\nto become a \u201chub for videogame\nculture\u201d.\nThe Arcade, which will take\nup residence in a 33,000 sq foot\nbuilding, will spread its permanent\ncollection across five entire floors.\nA vast majority of the pieces in the\ngallery will come from the National\nVideogame Archive, a vast collection\nnumbering 20,000 objects, currently\nheld by the Science Museum, London.\nThis will be the first time that\nmany pieces in the collection will\nhave been exhibited to the public, a\nprospect that excites Ian Livingstone,\na member of the museum\u2019s advisory\nboard; \u201cfor the millions of people who\nlove them,\u201d said Mr Livingstone, \u201cit is\nonly natural that videogames should\nhave their own permanent, cultural\nhome\u201d.\nThe announcement comes at a\ntime of heightened debate about\nwhether exactly videogames can be\ncalled \u2018art\u2019, an issue that has increased\nin prominence over the last few\nyears. Once thought of as only the\npreserve of snotty teenage boys, it\nhas become increasingly apparent\nthat videogames can present an\nexciting artistic medium, with games\nsuch as Flower (2009) and Journey\n(2012) showing how developers can\ntranscend the traditional tropes\nthat have formed the core of many\nvideogames, and create something\nboth beautiful and meaningful.\nThe argument is not just\nconstrained to artistic theory either;\neconomically, games represent a\nmajor force. The UK video game\nmarket is the largest in Europe, and\nGrand Theft Auto V (2013), the latest\nin the popular series, grossed more\nthan $1 billion within three days of\nits release.\nWith games representing such\na large presence in the UK, both\nculturally and economically, it\nseems that the National Videogame\nArcade is the logical next step, and\nshould help the industry shake off the\nlong-running stereotypes that have\nfollowed it around for the last three\ndecades.\nGian Gerolamo Grumelli c.1560, Moroni.

It not only\ndisplays the works in their full glory,\nbut also explains details of the sitters\u2019\nlives, allowing us the rare chance to\nimmerse ourselves fully in Moroni\u2019s\nwonderful world.\nGiovanni Battista Moroni is on at The\nSackler Wing of The Royal Academy,\nuntil 25th January 2015.\nTickets are \u00a312 for adults; \u00a310 for\nstudents; members and under-16s go free.\n\n"

It\u2019s no state secret that a majority of the people who are reading\nthis have encountered it \u2013 whether\nthat be through occasional to regular\nrecreational use or simply knowing\nsomeone who has taken it.\nIn the 2013 Felix drug survey,\nMDMA was revealed as the second\nmost regularly used illegal drug\namongst students at Imperial College,\nclosely following cannabis. Furthermore, according to a recent drug\nsurvey by The Guardian, 31% of the\nUK population aged 16-24 have taken\nillegal drugs and 25%of this subsam-ple admitted to having taken MDMA\nat least once in their lives. It is safe\nto say that it is a promiscuous drug,\nwhose usage has been shown to span\nacross all ages and social classes.\nRegarded among scientists as an\n\u2018empathogen\u2019 encouraging social\ninteraction and openness, but better\nknown by clubbers for its ability to\nmake you feel like you\u2019ve just eaten\na golden mushroom in Super Mario,\nMDMA makes your heart race, booty\nshake and sweat pour as it fuels an all-night dance workout of the like you\nwould never see at Ethos.\nResearchers at Imperial are taking\na different perspective on MDMA\nand shifting attitudes away from its\nwidely renown clubbing reputation\nand moving them towards its medical\npotential. Dr Robin Carhart-Harris\n(you may have read our article a few\nweeks ago about his research with\nLSD), alongside other researchers at\nImperial College and University College London including the infamous\nProfessor David Nutt, are utilising\nMDMA\u2019s empathy-inducing and\npositive emotion-enhancing qualities.\nThere is potential for use amongst patients in therapy, to help sufferers of\npost-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).\nThis team of scientists screened 19\nvolunteers on fMRI scanners after\ntaking small doses of the drug (100mg\nMDMA-HCl) to detect changes in cerebral blood flow (which has been causally linked to neurological activity).\nThey also conducted tests involving\nmemory cues describing participants\u2019\nbest and worst autobiographic memories to see their reaction on MDMA\ncompared with controls.\nVolunteers rated their favourite\nmemories as significantly more\nvivid, emotionally intense and positive after MDMA than placebo and\nexperienced worst autobiographical\nmemories as significantly less nega-tive, alongside a reported reduced\nfear-response. One participant of\nthe study described their experience:\n\u201cWhen I reached back for the bad\nmemories [under MDMA] they did\nnot seem as bad; in fact, I saw them as\nfatalistic necessities for the occurrence of later good events.\u201d\nWith a marked positive shift in\nemotional perception of both good\nand bad autobiographical memories\nthe results of this particular study\nindicate that MDMA holds potential\nfor use in conjunction with psycho-therapy. After looking over scans of\nthe volunteers\u2019 brains, they also saw\nthat in participants that had taken\nMDMA there was increased blood\nflow to an area of the brain known to\nbe involved in processing complex\nvisual stimuli, such as faces. They\ntherefore hypothesised that this increased activity related to the reports\nof heightened vividness of memory\nrecollection while on the drug.\nExposure therapy is the current\ntreatment for PTSD and is very\neffective. It requires patients to\nremember traumatic memories in\norder to re-engage and overcome\nthem (similar to treatments for pho-bias). One theory for using MDMA\nalongside exposure therapy is that it\ncould allow the patient to more easily\nengage with traumatic memories,\nmaking psychotherapy more effective\nand also shortening the length of the\ncostly treatment procedure.\nAs with almost everything in\nscience, the results from this study\nshould be taken with a pinch of\nsalt and with the limitations of the\nmethodology in mind. Despite an\nimproved sample size compared with\nprevious research, it is still small and\nthere is always room for expansion\nwith these studies, which is partly\nthe reason why they are carried out\nin the first place. Dr Carhart-Harris\nalso stressed the need for more\nresearch into further understanding\nexactly how MDMA has such potent\nand influential effects on emotional\nprocessing.\nLast week I conducted an interview\nwith Dr Carhart-Harris about his\ncareer and ongoing research into LSD.\nHe is a charming man and interesting\nspeaker \u2013 keep your eyes peeled for\nhis feature article in a future edition\nof Felix.\nDoi:10.1017/S1461145713001405\nEcstacy pills have been closely linked with the clubbing scene since the 80s and beginnings of house music Photo: Lauren Ratcliffe\n\"[MDMA]\ncould\nallow the\npatient to\nmore easily\nengage\nwith\ntraumatic\nmemories\"\n\n"

All\npassengers were then told to leave the\ntrain, and the police were called to the\nstation.\nThe team, under the impression\nthat the train was terminated due to a\nsignal failure, left the station unaware\nof the unwanted attention they had\nattracted.\nThe reports, made in the Evening\nStandard, described how the tube\ntrain was taken out of service after\nplaying the Rugby players started\na \u201cbooze-fuelled stripping game on\nboard.\u201d\nMembers of the team were seen\nstripping on Richmond station,\nengaging in a game where they run\nonto the platform, strip to their\nboxers, then re-dress before the train\ndoors close and the train pulls out\nagain.\nThe group were identified due to\ntheir kit, which bore the Imperial\nCollege Rugby emblem. Team\nmembers were also seen to be\nswigging wine whilst on the tube.\nA TfL spokeswoman said: \u201cAt\naround 5.30pm yesterday a train\nwas held for about eight minutes\nat Stamford Brook station due to a\ncustomer incident.\u201d\n\u201cIt was then emptied of passengers\nand de-trained. The British Transport\nPolice were called.\u201d\nA British Transport Police\nspokeswoman said: \u201cOur officers were\ncalled to Stamford Brook London\nUnderground station shortly after\n17.30 on Wednesday, 29th\nOctober,\nto reports of a group of naked men\non a District Line train between\nRichmond and Upminster.\u201d\nJames Cox, the first XV Captain,\nspoke to Felix. Cox said, \u201c We would\nlike to clarify that this was an\nindependent occurrence, it did not\nhappen as a group. It was purely\npeople acting out independent of the\nrugby team.\n\u201cThis behaviour is completely out\nof nature, and steps will be taken to\nensure it doesn\u2019t happen again. Those\ninvolved will be disciplined, and I\napologise on behalf of the club for\nany upset caused.\u201d\nImperial College Union has\nsuspended the team until an\ninvestigation takes place to establish\nexactly what happened.\nThe team in question has already\nmet with the Union to start the\nprocess, although it could be a\nwhile before the team plays again.\nThe Sabbatical team will lead the\ninvestigation, although there is no\ndefinitive answer as to when the\ninvestigation will be completed.\nThis follows from an incident last\nweek, when an anonymous source\nrevealed to Felix that the Medics 3rd\nRugby Team were caught on camera\nThis photo is from The JPR WIlliams Cup Match in March. Teams from both Imperial College and Imperial Medics are under intense scrutiny following this week's events Photo: Ian Gillett\nrunning around naked, and urinating\nand vomiting at Heston.\nThe footage was released to the\nUnion, who are now investigating the\nmatter, although it is uncertain as to\nwhat the consequences maybe for the\nteam at this time.\nThe cameras, installed for security\nreasons around the Heston ground,\ncaught the footage. On screen,\nmembers of the team were identified,\nand as a result, are under a self-imposed ban to not drink at the venue\nfor the next two months.\nAbi de Bruin, Deputy President\n(Clubs and Societies) said that\nthe Union will be launching an\ninvestigation next week into the\nHeston incident too.\nThe event occurred after the\nteam were drinking at the Heston\nbar, named the Teddington Bar,\nor \u201cTeddy\u2019s\u201d, in a nod towards the\nformer medic sports ground that\nclosed earlier this year. The team\nmembers then proceeded to run\naround the grounds naked.\nTom Wheeler, President of\nImperial College Union, said to Felix:\n\u201cDariush [Medic\u2019s Student Union\nPresident] and I are engaging with\nthe Club Captain and Team Captain\nto ensure that a decent standard of\nbehaviour is abided by when students\nare participating in Club-related\nsocial events.\u201d\n\u201cPotential sanctions have not yet\nbeen decided, however continued\npoor behaviour such as this could\nresult in punitive measures, such\nas reduction in or expulsion from\nBUCS.\u201d\nRepresentatives from Sport\nImperial were unavailable for\ncomment.\n\n"

Being able\nto live in a fairy-tale castle, enjoy the\nprivileges and most of all, the dresses\nand beautiful outfits that come with\nit. Look at Cinderella; she got a dress\nfrom her fairy god mother and the\nnext thing you know, she fell in love\nwith a prince and they lived happily\never after.\nBut princesses and royals don\u2019t\njust exist in fairy tales, and nor do\ntheir beautiful dresses. Kensington\nPalace has put on the Fashion Rules\nexhibition showcasing HM Queen\nElizabeth, Princess Margaret and\nPrincess Diana\u2019s dresses and outfits\nranging from the 50s to the 80s.\nThe exhibition is separated into\nthree sections, of outfits worn by the\nQueen Elizabeth II in the 50s and\n60s, Princess Margaret in the 60s and\n70s and Princes Diana in the 80s.\nVideos and covers of Vogue from the\nrespective eras are also on display.\nThe collection showcases many\ndesigns; notably those by Norman\nHartnell, one of the Queen\u2019s favorite\nand designed many of her 50s ball\ngowns. The young queen is more\nconservative in her fashion but the\nstyle still contains the essence of the\n50s such as the full skirt.\nDuring her tour in the 50s\ncommonwealth tour the queen had\ncommissioned many beautiful gowns\nwith design related to the national\nflag colours and flowers of the visiting\ncountry, for example the beautiful\nHardy Amies gown the young queen\nwore to a banquet in Halifax was\nincorporated with embroideries of\nmayflowers (the official symbol of\nNova Scotia). The royal gowns she\nwore are mostly full-skirted with\nfitted bodices in light, pastel colours\nthat befit a queen. Fabrics were\nmainly in silk with heavy beading\nand embroidery.\nPrincess Margaret was considered\nto be a fashion icon in the 60s\nthrough to the 70s. The princess is\nless conservative in style compared\nto the queen, often at the forefront of\nfashion with her choices. Collections\nof her dresses and coats include\nearly works from Christian Dior.\nThe collection shows the transition\nof fashion into the modern era. One\nof her more modern choices is the\nturban and kaftan made of exquisite\nIndian sari silk.\nMoving onto Princess Diana in the\n80s; as one of the most photographed\nwoman in the world, her fashion\nchoices included a wide range of\ndesigners from Catherine Walker to\nBruce Oldfield. Padded shoulders,\nasymmetrical sleeves as well as a\ndropped waistline were all in style\nduring the 80s.\nIf you are a true lover of fashion\nor curious about the glamour of the\nroyals, this exhibition is a must-see.\nNot to mention, the exhibition do not\nrequire any extra fees apart from the\nentrance fee to Kensington Palace,\nwhich is magnificent to see in itself,\nand this with the added fashion bonus\nof seeing a range of styes, including\nthe Victorian era style and Queen\nVictoria\u2019s wedding dress.\nTop right: Dress worn by Princess Margaret.

Is the standard of\npostgrad teaching better than for\nundergrads?\nP: I\u2019m not in a position to say yet,\nI\u2019ve only had this job a month and a\nhalf. There are concerns, involving\nleague tables, just like with undergrad\nleague tables, so there is an interest in\nwanting to get postgrad students to be\ninvolved with feedback on education.\nB: How do you think Nat did last\nyear?\nP: I think she did a great job. I wasn\u2019t\nas heavily involved in the Union\nbefore I got the role as Nat was, so I\ncan only really judge now how she\ndid. Her involvement with the year\nand dep reps was outstanding.\nB: It has been suggested that the\nstudents who complete the NSS\nperhaps give an unrepresentative\nview because of the amount of\nsurveys students get sent to\ncomplete.\nP: Yeah, the Union recognises that\nstudents may be getting over-surveyed.\nB: But is there a better way than\nconducting surveys to find out the\nstudent opinion?\nP: Maybe better use of year reps?\nRegular student engagement is useful.\nB: Why did you run for a\nsabbatical position?\nP: A friend of mine recommended\nto Nat that I should run for the DPE\nposition. I gave it some thought.\nB: Why did your friend\nrecommend to Nat that she talk to\nyou?\nP: I was a year rep before, and I was a\ntreasurer for another society before\nwith my friend, so I guess he thought\nI did a good job!\nB: What are you doing after this\nyear?\nP: I have just finished my 3rd\nyear of\nEEE, so I\u2019m going back to complete\nmy degree. It\u2019s going to be interesting\nchanging back going from a working\nenvironment back to student life.\nB: Why did you run for a sabb\nposition now rather than later on\nin your degree?\nP: The chances of winning were good!\nB: What do you think about\nChris saying that the DPE and\nDPW should be combined? Or do\nyou think you two are doing two\nseparate jobs, the roles worthy of\ntwo full-time employees?\nP: Yeah, I think there should be two\nseparate roles.\nB: What do you think about him\ndonating a third of his salary?\nP: I think it\u2019s very admirable.\nB: Is there anything you like or\ndislike about the Union from a\nstudent perspective?\nP: Good question, when I was a\nstudent, I never really knew what\nthe Union was or what the Union\nprovides. But now I realise that\nthe Union has some great schemes\nrunning the representation network\nand also having all the clubs and\nsocieties. I think some students take\nthe Union for granted, and I think\nthat the Union should maybe address\nthis, by better communication.\nB: What do you think about having\nhot desk sessions?\nP: No. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s very\napproachable. Open office policy is\nbetter; it\u2019s more private and would be\nmore successful.\nB: What manifesto points did you\nhave for this year?\nP: Feedback, E-Learning, Postgrad\ninvolvement.\nB: What about the issue of\nchanging the deadline policy?\nSo students don't get zero marks\nfor being a minute late for the\ndeadline?\nP: That\u2019s a welfare point.\nB: Why is it primarily welfare?\nP: Because it was Chris\u2019 manifesto\npoint! It\u2019s his project, but we\u2019re all\nbehind it. It brings back the issue of\nDPE and DPW. The line is blurred\nbetween them, because Imperial is an\neducational institution, but student\nwelfare is obviously an issue.\nB: Did you go out a lot in\nyour Freshers week? Can you\nrecommend any places or any\nplaces to avoid?\nP: I didn\u2019t go out a lot. East London\u2019s\nquite exciting! I used to live in East\nLondon, so just go out in the area and\nsee what\u2019s there.\nB: If you were trapped on a desert\nisland with the other Sabbs, who do\nyou think you would collectively\ndecide to eat first?\nP: Whoever would provide the most\nnutrition. Don\u2019t know who that is!\nB: Who do you think would be the\nlast person to survive?\nP: Probably Tom, he can climb over\nrocks and everything!\nB: If you had to have tinder, what\nbio would you have?\nP: Normally, I would leave those\nprofiles blank. With regards to\nonline dating, I think it\u2019s interesting\nto provide as little information\nas possible, so then when you get\nchatting, you have things to talk\nabout, like \u201cWhat do you do?\u201d and\n\u201cWhere are you from?\u201d\nB: Okay, say your tinder profile\nearns you a date but because you\nare so busy with all your Sabb\nduties, you don't have time to\nleave campus, and have to have\nyour first date at an Imperial\nestablishment. Where do you go?\nP: Either the Union Bar or Eastside.\nDepends which one\u2019s quieter.\nB: If you had to eat one meal from\nFiveSixEight for the rest of your\nlife, what would it be?\nP: Chicken burger with cheese and\nbacon with curly fries!\nB: Didn't even have to think about\nthat one!\n\n"

It\ndefinitely\ndoesn't\ntake\nitself too\nseriously.\"\nAre you alright? The guy next\nto me leans over and asks, a\nworried look on his face. Crap.\nHe\u2019s on to me. I\u2019m playing Lords of\nthe Fallen, a Hack \u2018n\u2019 slash heavily\ninfluenced by Dark Souls. When I\nplay games of this intensity, I start\nmouth breathing pretty heavily (think\ncombination of Darth Vader and\nnervous stoat), eventually graduating\ninto continuous angry muttering. I\nwould feel bad for my neighbour, but\nI\u2019m too busy getting killed for the 33rd\ntime, and saying unprintable things\nabout the mother of the First Boss.\nLords of the Fallen is a blast.\nYou are Harkyn, a criminal in a\nworld where no sins are forgotten\n(literally tattooed on your face, in fact).\nThe rulers of the world are apparently\nclose to banishing evil from humans\n(which sounds like it might involve\nlots of brainwashing and murder, but\nwhatever). However, an ancient enemy,\na broken God, has decided to attack the\nhuman realm with his army of demons.\nHarkyn has been offered a chance at\nredemption. He must use his sins and\nbeat back the army. I can tell you from\nthe 2+ hours I played, that this involves\nlittle diplomacy but lots of murdering\neverything you see with a hammer.\nThis is the story from the official\nwebsite. It\u2019s is revealed slowly, and I\nspent most of the time being brutalised\nby the sword of the second boss, so I\ncan\u2019t really comment on how accurate\nit is. What I can tell you about is the\ngameplay. It would be difficult to talk\nabout any part of Lords of the Fallen\nwithout mentioning Dark Souls (a\nHack \u2018n\u2019 Slash notorious for its brutal\ndifficulty). If you\u2019ve already played it,\nthen the game will seem very familiar\nto you. The mechanics, the storytelling,\nthe art style and the general feel of\nthe game are all pretty similar. You\ndo get a real sense however, that\nwhile the developers have been quite\nconservative with their core design,\nthey really have tried to embellish the\nold formula. It also looks very, very\npretty running on a PS4.\nThe most notable difference is the\nfact that the difficulty is slightly less\nintense. This doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s easy. I\nwas allowed to record my game session,\nand I died a total of 72 times (this is\npartly due to the fact that I had to use\na controller, which I suck ass at using.\nI think at one point I was just doing\nforward rolls for about 3 minutes).\nWhen you die, your experience from\nyour previous life is slowly depleted,\nunless you find your \u201cghost\u201d, upon\nwhich the remaining XP is restored.\nXP can be banked at checkpoints to\nupgrade your attributes and skills.\nHowever, If you choose to play balls-to-the-wall you can keep the XP,\nincreasing your multiplier, but with\nthe risk of losing all of it if you die and\ncan\u2019t find your ghost.\nThere are six potential classes,\nranging from the lumbering tank of\nthe warrior, to the extremely quick\nand fragile rogue. There are also\nthe usual multitude of weapon and\narmour options, allowing for a lot of\ncustomisation. The core mechanic of\nYour name is Giorgio Manos.\nSporting red hair, a light blue\nsuit and white gloves, your\nprofession: limousine driver. You\npick up passengers and deliver them\nto their respective destinations for\ncash, but there\u2019s a twist\u2026 literally. You\ndon\u2019t just drive the way your wheels\nare pointing (what would be the point\nin that?), your limousine is constantly\nspinning while you attempt to navigate around the town \u2018Roundabout\u2019.\nThereareplentyofbothstaticand\ndynamicobstaclestonegotiatewheneveryou\u2019rebehindthewheel.These\ninclude:trees,roundabouts,buildings,\nothercars,people\u2026yes,itisoneof\nthosegameswherenotonlyisrunning\noverpeoplenotdiscouraged,thereisa\nfinancialincentive\u2013earningcentsata\ntimeandbuildingamultiplierupfor\nchainsofhitandruns.\nSowhatmakesthisgamedifferent\ntoclassicgameslikeCarmageddon\norDriver?Surprisingly,itisthestory\nandthewayitisportrayed.Setin1977\nAmerica,anddeliberatelyinthestyle\nofacheesyB-movie,Roundaboutisnot\nforthoselookingforaseriousgaming\nexperience(ifthatwasn\u2019tclearenough\nalready).Cutscenesareshotinreal-life\nanddeliberatelypoorlyacted,contrib-utingtothehumorousplotdevelop-mentsthatunravelasyoucomplete\nmoremissions.\nYourcustomersincludeschoolkids\nlookingforarampagingjoyride,a\nshadymechanictryingtohelpyou\nbecomethebestrotatinglimodriverin\nRoundabout, acorruptbusinessman\nandmyfavourite,askeletonnamed\nJeffrey\u2013whoofcoursetakespartin\ntriathlons\u2013\u201cbecauseit\u2019sthetakingpart\nthatcounts\u201d (oneofyourtasksistorun\novertheentirecompetitionbecausehe\nislosing).\nIfthemainstorymissionsbecome\ntoorepetitive,youcanparticipatein\noptionalchallengessuchasBaseball\u2013a\ntime-trialaroundtown,runningover\nasmanypeopleaspossibleandavoid-ingweaponisedcarsfallingoutthesky\nforaslongaspossible.Alongwiththe\nmainmissions,yourscoreisposted\ntoanonlineleaderboard\u2013givingyou\nsomeincentivetorepeatandbecome\ntheworld\u2019sbestat\u201crotatinglimousine\nkeepie-uppies\u201d.\nHowever,thisgameisnotwithout\nthe game appears to be thus: Die, try a\ndifferent strategy and combination of\ngear, rinse and repeat until you find\none that works. This sounds dull. It\u2019s\nnot. The balance on the game is very\nwell done-at the start it\u2019s all absurdly\nfrustrating, but this evaporates fairly\nquickly, and you start feeling like an\nunconquerable badass. Naturally, the\ngame punishes your hubris, and kills\nyou again. But importantly, when you\ndie, it usually feels like it was because\nyou did something stupid, rather than\nthe game.\nThere are a couple of weaknesses.\nI only played for a couple of hours,\nso I couldn\u2019t really get into the story.\nHowever, from first glance it does seem\na bit derivative, and the gameplay is\nvery linear. Harkyn is gruff white male\nwith dirty past/beard combo #3712,\nbut that\u2019s not specific to Lords of the\nFallen. In addition, considering the\nnumber of control options, the PC port\nis almost certainly going time, and\nsaying unprintable things about the to\nbe horrendous, but you can always play\nwith a controller.\nThere are problems certainly \u2013 it\nfeels a bit too close to Dark Souls,\nthe learning curve is initially very\nsteep and profoundly frustrating.\nBut there are moments when, after a\nchange in strategy, you hit the sweet\nspot, get the perfect combo and crush\nsome demonic\u2019 warlords face in with\na huge hammer, that I guarantee you\nfeel like the most powerful guy on\nthe planet. And when you inevitably\ndie a minute later, instead of rage\nquitting you just mutter \u201cI\u2019ll piss on\nyour corpse, fucker\u201d then jump back\nin. The feeling of success after intense\neffort is profoundly satisfying, and\nunbelievably fun. In the end, that\u2019s all I\nwant from a game.\n\"When you\ndie, it usually feels\nlike it was\nbecause\nyou did\nsomething\nstupid,\nrather than\nthe game. \"\n\"Saying\nunprintable things\nabout the\nmother of\nthe First\nBoss; Lords\nof the\nFallen is a\nblast.\nitsnegatives.Themainissueisthe\nrespawningelement.Thelimousine\nyoudriveisfragile,andwhilethegame\ngivesyouachangeableupgradeto\nimproveyourdrivingabilityincertain\nsituations,itcanonlyendureahandful\nofhitsbeforeexploding.Whennot\nonamission,thistakesyoubackto\nthenearestgaragewhichcanmake\ntravellingtothenextmissionquite\nfrustrating.\nTosummarise,thisgameisgood\nfun.Itdefinitelydoesn\u2019ttakeitself\ntooseriouslyandthemainmechanic\nisveryuniqueandquitechallenging.\nThestoryisdefinitelyentertaining\nbutsomeofthesubplotsaredifficult\ntofollowconsideringthesimilarities\nbetweentasks\u2013takingpersonXfrom\nAtoB.Butmyadvice?Giveitawhirl.\n\"Your name\nis Giorgio\nManos.\nSporting\nred hair,\nlight blue\nsuit and\nwhite\ngloves, your\nprofession:\nlimousine\ndriver\"\nPhoto: lordsofthefallen.pl\n\n"

Big\nnames like Justin Timberlake and\nTaylor Swift have only managed to\nsustain their popularity by mixing up\ntheir music with different genres and\nstyles in their new albums.\nPop music is slowly being redefined\nfrom where it got to in the mid to\nlate 2000\u2019s to a new amalgamation\nof indie, soul and electronic tunes.\nPeople are finally starting to\nappreciate real music and meaningful\nlyrics as opposed to changing their\nFacebook statuses to \u201cWhich seat can\nI take?\u201d\nAlthough it was finally time to\ngraduate from that mindset, you\nwould be surprised at how hard it\nis to get basic redundant melodies\nout of your head, no matter how\nhorrible the lyrics. Essentially, this\nmetamorphosis is not because we\nopened our eyes, but a result of a\ncombination of things.\nFirstly, the recent rise of new radio-based music apps (which obviously\ncomes with an increase in people that\ndownload and use them because of\nthe booming smartphone and tablet\nobsession. There are over 40 million\nactive Spotify users). Established\nmusic apps like SoundCloud and\nSpotify now have automatic playlist\ngeneration and recommendation\noptions where you can jump\nfrom genre to genre and listen to\nsimilar artists. YouTube recently\nlaunched a feature where streaming\na song automatically directs you\nto another video playlist which\nconsists of 50+ songs that you might\nlike based on your current choice.\nTherefore, people\u2019s options are being\nexponentially multiplied giving them\na chance to experience and appreciate\nnew genres and all in all improve\ntheir music taste.\nSecondly, the \u2018Deep house\u2019\nobsession. Although deadmau5 was\nconsidered cool in 2010, electronic\nmusic wasn\u2019t really appreciated as\nmuch as it is now. It is obvious by the\namount of upcoming and aspiring\nDJs. Sales of mixing equipment have\ngone up by around 30% in the last\ntwo years, with people focusing on\nmixing chart music with their own\ntwist, rather than creating endlessly\nlong instrumental samples. Famous\nclubs and bars have slowly started\nto play and focus on \u2018chilled\u2019 beats\nrather than Sean Kingston and Chris\nBrown. Pretty much everyone is just\nwaiting for \u2018the drop\u2019 these days.\nAlso, the antiquation of album\nsales With the rise of torrents and\nstreaming, most artists today make\ntheir money from live performances\nrather than album sales. This\nautomatically filters out the ones that\nbased their fortune of auto-tune and\nnot actual talent.\nFinally, general globalisation\nand an increasing appreciation of\ndifferent cultures. Fusion has always\nbeen around, but has, thankfully,\nslowly crept into chart music; a case\nin point is the loop in \u2018La La La\u2019 by\nNaughty Boy ft. Sam Smith: an\nexcerpt from a classical Indian folk\nsong.\nSo hurray for pop music not being\nsynonymous with trashy lyrics and\nauto-tune anymore! Let\u2019s hope that\nthe music industry continues to\nevolve and appreciate talent from all\nacross the world.\nPhoto: Andy Ford/NME\n\n"

    "content": "Sport Editor: Kunal Wagle\nsport.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nIssue 1586\nTaking the Plunge \u2013 the story of skydiving\nThere\u2019s a long-standing myth\nthat states that anyone who\ngoes skydiving is either\nmad, has no concept of death or is\nemotionally-blackmailed into doing\nit because their mum bought them\na voucher for their birthday. What I\ndiscovered was a group of inspiring,\nfriendly people who engage in an\nactivity with one of the best safety\nrecords of any extreme sport.\nI did my ground training in October\n2013, having just started my first\nyear at Imperial. Around that time\nI kind of happened upon the idea of\nlearning to skydive. I hadn\u2019t really\never thought about it before. In fact,\nI don\u2019t think I ever really thought\nanyone learned to skydive.\nOf course, I had the odd friend\nwho had taken the plunge and done\na charity skydive or gone just one\ntime, but they were always tandem\nskydives \u2013 that is, they were strapped\nto an instructor and didn\u2019t have to\ndo anything except look like they\nwere having a good time and resist\nthe urge to maul the person who was\nDRAGGING THEM OUT OF AN\nAIRPLANE.\nSo anyway, having never really\nconsidered myself a daredevil or\nadrenaline-junkie, I found myself\nstanding at the \u2018Imperial College\nSkydiving\u2019 stall at Freshers\u2019 Fair.\nThere I was, talking to someone with\nmore than a hundred solo jumps\nunder their belt, an Imperial student\njust like me \u2013 but I could never do\nthat, right? I mean, this guy must\nsecretly jump motorbikes over buses\nand set himself on fire and fight\nsharks with his bare hands.\nBut he looks normal, and I overhear\nhim complaining about how he hates\nhis landlord and how his lab report\nis overdue, at which point I realise\nthat not only is he normal, he is in\nfact completely unremarkable. Oh\nright, yeah, apart from the hundred\nplus skydives. Ok, well I guess I\u2019ll\nsign up to the mailing list, I thought.\nWho knows, maybe I could try it, and\nimpress people in the future.\nThe next thing I know, it\u2019s 09:00 on\na cold but sunny October morning,\nand I\u2019m standing in a field in Kent.\nSuch is the glamorous lifestyle of\na skydiver, I suppose. The week\nbefore, I had signed myself up for an\nImperial trip to a ground-training\nday, and now here I was.\nThis training was all that I needed\nto do my first solo skydive, as per\nthe British Parachuting Association\nregulations. I must say, to the\ninstructor\u2019s credit, it was during this\n10-hour, intensive training, that I\nrealised that I really, really wanted to\nskydive. Call it Stockholm syndrome\nif you want to, but if you find\nyourself doing nothing but exit drills,\nlanding practice and canopy-control\ntechnique for an entire day, it starts\nto grow on you.\nI started to realise that what sets a\nskydiver apart from a non-skydiver\nhas nothing to do with genetics, or\npersonality, or a reckless disregard\nfor personal safety. Nope, it\u2019s much\nsimpler than that. A skydiver is \u2013\nwait for it \u2013 someone who has jumped\nout of a plane. Yep. Nothing gets past\nme. But what I mean when I say that\nis that the only reason anyone ever\nbecame a skydiver, whether solo or\ntandem, is that they told themselves\nthat they had it in them to do it, and\nthen actually did it!\nAnyone that can do these two steps\nis a skydiver. Easy, right? Well, by\nenrolling in the ground training, I\nhad done the first step. I owed it to\nmyself to prove to everyone that I\ncould manage the second step.\nOnly a couple of days after my\nground training, I did it, my first\njump. I can\u2019t tell you much about it,\nas it was all a bit of a blur. What I can\nsay though, is that it wasn\u2019t scary.\nIt was surreal, like an out of body\nexperience, but the whole situation\nwas so foreign to my hyper-reacting\nbrain that I didn\u2019t even get a chance\nto be scared. My training had\nprepared me more than adequately\nfor what was about to happen, and I\nwas sitting opposite my instructor on\nthe plane, which was very reassuring.\nI would say the oddest thing I\nremember was the sensation of\nhaving nothing but 3,500 feet of\nempty air between your feet and the\nground when sitting at the door of\nthe plane, ready to perform your\nexit \u2013 that is to say, to fling yourself\ndesperately at the ground.\nFor my first jump the parachute\ndeployed itself via an attachment to\nthe airplane so, aside from the initial\ncouple of seconds shock, it mainly\nconsisted of a parachute ride. There\naren\u2019t many things in life that I would\nsay are breathtaking, but given that\nthis article is so far lacking in clich\u00e9s,\nI feel that it is a very appropriate\ndescription. It\u2019s not a long ride \u2013\nmaybe 5 minutes \u2013 but it was long\nenough for me to realise that I was\nnow a skydiver.\nI also realised that this sport would\nbecome a big part of my life. I\u2019ve since\ngained my skydiving A-licence after a\nyear of training and done more than\n20 solo jumps from 12000 feet, with\nup to a minute of freefall each time\n\u2013 but I still have a lot to learn! Along\nwith 3 other members of the Imperial\nSkydiving club, I\u2019m hoping to set up\na formation skydiving team for the\nfirst time in the club\u2019s history, later\nthis academic year.\nImperial College Parachute and\nSkydiving Club organises training\ntrips throughout the year for anyone\nwishing to experience solo skydiving.\nThey also run frequent tandem and\nwindtunnel trips for those who want\nto try things out before being left to\ntheir own devices in the sky. For more\ninformation visit their website at\nhttps://union.ic.ac.uk/rcc/parachute/\nor email parachute1@ic.ac.uk.\nJonny Jackson describes the thrill of jumping out of a plane...\nPhoto: IC Skydiving\nPhoto: IC Skydiving\n\n"

    "content": "THE STUDENT PAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON 39\nFELIX\nSport Editor: Kunal Wagle\n31.10.2014\nIt was cold and windy last\nWednesday afternoon when 25\nmembers of the Imperial Cross\nCountry and Athletics Club arrived\nat Hampstead Heath to take on the\nother London Colleges in the first\nCross Country race of the season:\nParliament Hill.\nWith their shiny new red & blue\nImperial vests in hand, the newest\nmembers of the club were ready\nto represent their Uni against the\nmasses of UCL, Kings, Brunel and St.\nMary\u2019s to name but a few.\nThe London College League (LCL)\nis a series of six cross country races\nwhich take place throughout first\nand second term all over London,\nincluding Richmond (Coming this\nWednesday) and Bushy Park.\nParliament Hill is the first race;\n8km for guys and 4km for girls,\nand containing some of the most\nnotorious climbs, it is often muddy,\nthough the new members of the club\nwere blissfully unaware of this.\nArriving at 2:45, there was time\nfor the team to have a short warm\nup, apply some imaginative red &\nblue face (war) paint and snap a quick\nteam photo before the race started\nat 3:15. At this point a long-standing\ntradition known as King-of-the-Hill\ntook place, when several runners\nraced to the top of the steep climb\nwhich makes up the first few hundred\nmeters of the course.\nImperial\u2019s nominated contender,\nJames \u2018I run 101km mountain races\nfor breakfast\u2019 Ellis, surely had a\nfine chance, but alas, St. Mary\u2019s had\nanticipated this threat and were quick\nout of the blocks to just steal the\ncrown by a few metres, adding more\nevidence to the case that they are in\nfact running cyborgs.\nThe race continued on over the\nscenic hills of Hampstead Heath,\nwith a number of Imperialites setting\nout well to the support of Women\u2019s\nCaptain Cloudy Carnegie, who had\nbeen forced to sit it out. The course\nwas complicated by limited marking,\nand there were several cases of\nrunners going the wrong way.\nThankfully after a couple of laps,\nall made it back without adding too\nmuch distance to their race. After\nsome hard-fought battles against\nfellow students, mud, dogs and \u2018The\nFlash\u2019, team Imperial came home\nstrong. Returning member Kimberly\nMason was first woman back for\nImperial, and debutants Jess Prior\nand Anna Lawson brought home the\ntop three girls team after their lap.\nThey then turned their attention\nto an incredible sight; fresher Chris\nOlley coming home in first place!\nAn impressive victory considering\nthe many good runners from St.\nMary\u2019s and Kings. Not far behind was\nanother newcomer, Mike Ridley, and\nold timer Liam Smith.\nGreat displays were also shown by\nRupert Hepton and Johnny Bosch,\nwhile newcomers Tom Stokes and\nChloe Mason had navigational issues\nand Will Jones gallantly dropped\nout of the race to help a runner from\nanother college who\u2019d sprained\ntheir ankle. All in all this was a great\nperformance in tough conditions and\na brilliant start to the year for team\nImperial.\nA well-earned club meal in GBK\nfollowed. Feel free to join us next\nweek for a far flatter run amongst the\ndeer in Richmond Park or one of our\nmany other scenic Training sessions.\nFor more info find us on facebook\nor email us on run@imperial.ac.uk.\nRugby 2nd XV lose close game\nImperial\u2019s 2nd team made the\nlong journey to Kent to play\nChristchurch Canterbury,looking\nto rectify last week\u2019s game which\nby all rights should have been won.\nImperial clearly coped better\nwith the delayed start as they\nhad the upper hand in the early\nexchanges,which resulted in Tom\nMavin making an inspired run\ninvolving steps and fends going\nover to score a seven pointer.\nThis seemed to ire up the\nopposition and their large hoard\nof supporters thus allowing them\nto gain some front football,using\ntheir big runners unimaginatively\nyet effectively.A combination of\nthis and some poor defending from\nImperial allowed Christchurch into\nthe lead to with two tries.\nChristchurch kept the pressure\non but improved defence from\nImperial limited them to a\ncouple of long range penalty\nefforts which they were unable to\nconvert. Eventually Imperial,with\nTom Mavin setting the example,\nswitched on again and worked\ntheir way up the ield and after\nsome nice back interplay Ruairi\nDunne was able to score in the\ncorner.\nThis was backed up by a nice\nconversion by Anthony Cheuk to\nput Imperial back in the lead just\nbefore half time.The second half\nwas not quite as entertaining as\nthe irst,with neither side really\nable to gain a foot hold.\nA lack of match practice\nshowed for Imperial as we\nspent vast amounts of the half\ntrying to play rugby in our own\nred zone.Ultimately this cost\nus as Christchurch were able to\ncapitalise on an Imperial mistake\nand score again.\nImperial tried to ight back but\nunfortunately time was against\nthem and the match ended in a\n17-14 defeat.\nJOSEPH BOWDEN\nMATT DOUTHWAITE\nICXC CHAIR\nEarly victory for Imperial\nPhoto: IC Cross Country\nIt's never too late to join IC Rugby Photo: IC Cross Country\nThe unbeaten ICURFC boys\nproudly journeyed all the\nway out to North London\nto challenge the medics of UCL \u2013\nofficially the RUMS rugby club \u2013 in\nwhat was sure to be a crucial, possibly\ntitle-deciding fixture.\nAll was faring well on the Imperial\nboys\u2019 quest to become men as Coach\nRich was seen to have found his\nway to the correct ground for a\nWednesday fixture.\nConfidence was high as Ed\n\u201cPaper Plane\u201d Durkin (Captain of\nMorale, season 14-15) cheered on\nhis housemate and on-field captain,\nJames Cocks, to kick over the first\nthree points of the game in favour of\nImperial.\nThe early lead was well deserved but\nunfortunately short-lived as RUMS\nran in two tries in quick succession to\ntake a cushioned lead.\nThe Imperial reply was powerful\nwith Tom Hedley scoring close to the\nposts to allow easy addition of the\nfollowing two points.\nA double interchange of scores\nbetween the two sides saw Hedley\ntally again and the board begin to\nlook like a village cricket total.\n26-22 to RUMS. The Imperial boys\nspent the first 20 minutes of the\nsecond half retaining the ball and\nplaying the best rugby of the game\nbut were held out by a gritty defense.\nThe forwards worked their way up\nthe field with powerful breaks from\nAdam Postlethwaite and Joe Bowden.\nFinally the ball was released to the\nbacks to be spread wide and Fred\nBrown used his pace to evade his\nopposite number and touch down in\nthe corner, granting the away side the\nlead again.\nUnfortunately a two-footed\nchallenge from the opposition landed\nnear Freddie\u2019s, formerly untouched\nand innocent, sphincter as he dived in\nto score resulted in a substitution of\nwingers to see young Carlos Sheppard\ntake the field, all the way from British\nColumbia.\nLadies of Imperial you have\nnothing to worry about as I\u2019m sure\nMr. White, one of the founding\nfaces of RigSoc, will not be deterred\nfrom attending ACC this coming\nWednesday.\nIC\u2019s defense appeared to become\nmore and more flimsy as RUMS put\nin another thirteen points to take a\ncomfy lead.\nWith only minutes to go Olisa\nUfodiama (certified BNOC) brushed\noff numerous tackles to charge up\ncenterfield and score between the\nposts to narrow the margin.\nUnfortunately the boys\u2019 hopes were\ncrushed as RUMS relentlessly scored\nanother ten points and sealed their\nvictory late on.\nThe despondent Imperial lads\ntrudged back to South Kensington\nwithout Sylvia to drown their sorrows\nand begin preparations for the fixture\nagainst St. Mary\u2019s. This game is sure\nto result with a victory.\nBe sure to make your way through\nthe hot gate on Wednesday 29th\nOctober to attend ACC and observe\nthe might of the disciplined and\nuniform ICURFC.\nJOE BOWDEN\nICU RUGBY PRESS OFFICER\nImperial Rugby 1st\nXV can\u2019t prevent\ndefeat to RUMS\n\n"

He\nrecalled when she \u201cmade the first live\nChristmas broadcast in 1957\u201d and was\n\u201cthe first monarch to send an email,\nduring a visit to the Royal Signals and\nRadar Establishment\u201d on 26 March\n1976.\nThe tweet was retweeted over\n41,000 times and favourited over\n44,000 times. It wasn\u2019t the first tweet\nfrom the account (\n@BritishMonarchy) but it was the\nfirst tweet that she personally had\nsent.\nThe early days of the exhibition\nhave been extremely well received,\nwith Baroness Lane Fox saying,\n\u201cthis gallery reminds me of the\nextraordinary ambition of so much\nof the UK\u2019s past - from laying the\ntransatlantic telegraph cable, to the\ninvention of the World Wide Web. It\ntherefore throws down the gauntlet\nfor the future and provides fabulous\ninspiration.\u201d\nSimon Segars, who is Chief\nExecutive of ARM, added: \u201cThe future\nis always nurtured in the minds of\nour children and a gallery such as\nthe Science Museum\u2019sInformation\nAgecan inspire them to unleash their\nideas.

It was so exciting\nthat our esteemed Monarch came so\nclose to Imperial College. It reminds\nme of a quote she made in 1947: \u2018I\ndeclare before you all that my whole\nlife, whether it be long or short, shall\nbe devoted to your service and the\nservice of our great Imperial family\nto which we all belong.\u2019\u201d When it\nwas pointed out that this might not\nbe about the College, he said that the\nquote was \u201copen to interpretation\u201d.\nHowever, the tweet did not escape\ncontroversy. When the BBC reported\non the momentous tweet, they\ninadvertently showed a reply by\nsomeone called WolfgangDikface (\n@WolfgangDikface), who said \u201cfuck\noff\u201d. Dikface then tweeted \u201cLook\nmum, I\u2019m famous\u201d, and followed it\nup with \u201cNew followers: Have a look\nround, make yourself comfortable\nbut telling an 88 year old woman to\nf*** off on the BBC is about as good\nas i get (sic).\u201d In response to this\nChris Kaye said, \u201cI feel that the only\nconsequence for people who befoul\nSECTION EDITOR\nHer Majesty on social media should\nbe to have their heads on spikes.

One of you takes a wrong\nturning and somehow you suddenly\nlost in a part of London you don\u2019t\nknow. You stop and ask for directions,\nbut no-one is being helpful. And even\nthough there are only five of you,\nfor some reason you can hear a sixth\nset of footsteps. Is there someone\nfollowing you?\nOops, it seems like you\u2019ve\ninadvertently walked into the scenes\nof a horror film. If you\u2019re going to\nsurvive the night, you\u2019d better follow\nmy advice.\nBe the right person\nFirst off, to survive you need to make\nsure that you\u2019re the right character.\nEveryone knows that it\u2019s the blonde\nbimbo in eight-inch heels, and an\ninappropriately small amount of\nclothing for the time of year, that goes\nfirst. So make sure you have a pair of\nsensible shoes for running on, and\ntry to care more about your life than\nbreaking a nail.\nNext up as a victim, it\u2019s probably\neither the jock or the outsider \u2013 the\nalpha male is a pretty easy target for\nany self-respecting murderer, for\nmultiple reasons. One: they probably\nstand the best chance of stopping you.\nTwo: I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s just the rules.\nI don\u2019t write the rules. I don\u2019t even\nknow who writes the rules. As for the\noutsider, they\u2019re just easy pickings,\nright? I mean, nobody really talks\nto them, they\u2019re always off being\nintellectual \u2013 no-one will notice if\nsomeone casually sneaks up and\nviolently and noisily murders them.\nIf you\u2019re a girl, your best bet for\nsurvival is to be the meekly pretty\nvirgin with a bit of backbone that will\ntell the guy chasing you that they\u2019re\nevil, or crazy, or a murderer, then run\nfor the hills. If you\u2019re a guy, being the\nromantic interest is probably your\nbest bet. Even evil, crazy murderers\nare romantics at heart.\nGo to the right place\nCongratulations, you\u2019ve managed to\nbe the right person and survive the\nfirst couple of killings, but you\u2019ve got\na while to go before you\u2019re safe. You\nneed to find a good space to hide and\nwait until morning. Unfortunately\nit\u2019s fast approaching three in the\nmorning and anyone in there right\nmind is going to asleep, or at the very\nleast ignoring the crazy sounding\nperson banging on their door\nscreaming about a killer.\nThe first place you should probably\navoid is anywhere obviously\nabandoned. Creepy old factories, or\ntrain stations, or office blocks are\neasily the sort of place that a dastardly\nvillain could set a trap. You don\u2019t\nwant to nip to the loo in the middle of\nthe night only to be impaled by old,\nrusty equipment.\nTry not to go anywhere that is\nimbued with history either. Though\nyou may manage to avoid the guy\nchasing you for a bit, you\u2019re bound\nto bump into some nasty ghoul\nthat doesn\u2019t like the fact that you\u2019re\ninvading his territory, and come after\nyou.\nI hear that hotels are quite nice\nplaces to spend the night, why not see\nif you can find one?\nThings you shouldn\u2019t do\nDon\u2019t have sex. If you do, you will\ndie almost immediatly, if not during.\nEveryone knows that the couple who\nhave sex are always the next ones\nto die. Why not fill your time with\nuseful things like trying to escape\ninstead?\nDon\u2019t split up. For some reason in\nevery horror film someone decides\nthat it is a great idea to split up. Don\u2019t\nbe the idiot who suggests it. Splitting\nup is the one of the stupidest ideas\nyou can have. You\u2019re not Scooby Doo\nand his friends, you don\u2019t need to\nsearch for clues. Just stay together.\nDon\u2019t lose your phone. Don\u2019t put\nit down. Don\u2019t drop it and break\nit. It\u2019s one of the most important\npossessions you have for getting out\nof trouble. If you lose it, or lose your\nphone signal, you\u2019re probably already\ndead.\nFinally, don\u2019t be an idiot. And\nmaybe, if you\u2019re very lucky, you\nmight escape. Good luck!\nSeriously, don\u2019t be this girl Photo: Joss Whedon/Lionsgate\n\"your best\nbet for\nsurvival is\nto be the\nmeekly\npretty\nvirgin with\na bit of\nbackbone\"\n\n"

    "content": "8 THE STUDENT PAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON FELIX\n31.10.2014\nComment Comment Editor Tessa Davey\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nShould non-participants be forced\nto subsidise events?\nOh how trendy it is to decry\nthe College for their financial\ndecisions! Mind you, short of\nstating parallels with \u2018Butcher of the\nSomme\u2019, we can settle for glorifying\nan ambiguous term such as \u2018student\nexperience\u2019 \u2013 nails in the coffin, I\ntell you! But do we try to view this\ntopic from a rational perspective?\nI\u2019m afraid the morality fever has\npermeated the campus a little too far\nfor that - let\u2019s hope I\u2019m mistaken.\nA few clarifications I require with\nregards to the article. What\u2019s the\npoint of saying 220k budget is 0.22%\nof the College\u2019s endowment fund? Do\nyou think that it should be 0.23% or\nmaybe 0.26%? Your argument only\ndecries a loss of money from the fund\nfor social events of halls, on the basis\nthat otherwise, it would go to achieve\nsome \u2018common good\u2019, aka student\nexperience \u2013 and promptly say that\nthat 220k is \u2018fully affordable\u2019 for the\nCollege. You put forward arguments\nfor the existence of the fund, not\nits degree of financial resources;\njustifying affordability of the fund\nbased on a statistic of 0.22% looking\nmeagre, getting the gullible to agree\nwith your alarmist approach. Not to\nmention that endowment actually\nconcerns partly the investment of\nthe principal the College cannot use\nto fund on-going expenditures, only\nthe interest return it brings. So one\nactually needs to fiddle with the\ndefinition of endowment to arrive at\n0.22%.\nYour view of budgets, that if an\nactivity in isolation is deemed as\naffordable because it represents\nsome small part of the budget hence\njustified, is somewhat of a ridiculous\npremise. We need to consider 1)\nwhether given activity is in the\nremit of the College, 2) the costs\nand benefits of activity 3) compare\nthe activity to the host of other\npossibilities. That\u2019s a complex task,\nbut tackling step 1 will be sufficient to\nabsolve us of any need to proceed to\nsteps 2 and 3.\nDo social events by halls have 100%\nattendance rate? No. Whatever it\nis, it implies that non-participants\nare subsidising the participants \u2013\nthe money ultimately comes from\nstudents paying for halls. What\nright do people attending the events,\nincluding the hall seniors, have to\njustify forcing non-participants\nto subsidise these events? Student\nexperience? First, money\u2019s taken off\nme, then I find out it goes to pay for\nsome piss-up, and finally I\u2019m told I\ncan attend whether I like it or not \u2013\nsome experience, eh? (Before you say\nI don\u2019t have to live in halls: isn\u2019t that\na bit rich when we have a system of\npublic universities, receiving proceeds\nfrom general taxation? College is not a\nprivate entity.)\nThis is the pretence of knowledge \u2013\nalleging that hall seniors know better\nhow to provide student experience,\nrather than each individual student\ndeciding what events to pay for\nand engage to boost their \u2018student\nexperience\u2019. Value is subjective,\neach individual is valuing trade-offs\ndifferently and by denying me choice\nof spending my own money (that\nI had to chip in for the fund in the\nfirst place) on other events that will\nimprove my \u2018student experience\u2019, I\nam denied the \u2018student experience\nsurplus\u2019. Let\u2019s say that I decide to go\nto a student event to socialise, and\nhence boost my \u2018student experience\u2019,\nfor which I pay \u00a3x; I will pay for it\nif I personally value the \u2018student\nexperience\u2019 I get to be above \u00a3x; that\ndifference is the surplus that oh,\nmakes me happy! A one-size fits all\napproach of redistribution cannot\nachieve this.\nAlas, the answer is nearly provided\nin your article. You say, that with\nthe loss to the fund, there will be\nfewer events by halls. If the events\nare in demand by residents of halls,\nseniors can put them up, charge for\nthem, and see how it goes. Let them\ncompete with what this \u2018unfriendly\ncity\u2019 has to offer.\nNow, I assume you could say,\nbecause I benefit from social\ncooperation of students, I am\nobliged to give back to boost their\nstudent experience. Sorry, but social\ncooperation is a result of human\naction, not a perquisite \u2013 no subset\nof the student body provides it for\nmy enjoyment which would justify\ncharging me for utilising it and\nneither do I. It is a spontaneous result\nActual halls events may not be this classy, but they try. Photo: thamesluxurycharters\nANONYMOUS\nCOMMENT WRITER\n\"... don't let me\nkeep this small\nargument that\nwould favour\nthe idea of\nprivatising\nImperial.\"\nwith no ownership; one can withdraw\nto their own detriment. But what\nabout students who benefit less from\nthat social cooperation? It\u2019s their\nchoice how much they act to benefit\nfrom it \u2013 we have an equal right to\nsocial cooperation, but no right to\nequal outcomes from it.\nNow what do I think of the\nCollege\u2019s action? We pay them fees\nand in return we expect education\nin an environment conducive to it.\nThey should strive to provide, this\nbut that doesn\u2019t justify engaging in\nredistribution of \u2018student experience\u2019.\nScrap the fund and lower the fees for\nhalls. Don\u2019t give into wailing about\nstudent experience \u2013 otherwise, you\nsupport their conclusions that you\nknow better how to provide \u2018student\nexperience\u2019 then students themselves.\nAnd I am holding the College to this\nstandard because at the end of the\nday, they are a public university \u2013\ndon\u2019t let me keep this small argument\nthat would favour the idea of\nprivatising Imperial.\nGeorge Butcher\u2019s response...\nIt\u2019s nice to get a response from a\ncomment article\u2013it means at least\none person read it.\nSadly I don\u2019t see the parallels\nbetween the\u2018Butcher of the\nSomme\u2019(presumably referencing\nField Marshal Douglas Haig who\nlead British soldiers to 2 million\ncasualties in the irst world war)\nand the halls amenities fund,but\nthat may just be me.\nHalls are more than just\naccommodation,they are about\nbuilding a community.I know I\nwouldn\u2019t have met many of my\ngood friends without the strong\ncommunity that the hall seniors and\nwardens built up around my halls;\nfriends at other universities don\u2019t\nknow anyone outside their corridor\u2013\ndon\u2019t underestimate how important\norganised social events are in your\nirst year.\nWe expect more than just a\nlecture course from College,that\u2019s\nwhy it also funds our student union,\nemploys counsellors,has a doctor\u2019s\nsurgery and yes,provides irst years\nwith accommodation.It\u2019s a dificult\nbalance from College to make,but I\nbelieve it has failed to recognise the\nsigniicance of the amenities fund\nto many students.\nIn response to \u2018Yet another nail in the coin of the student\nexperience\u2019 by George Butcher\n\n"

Let\u2019s Sing About It.\nWhy am I depressed?\nWhat is the cause of my\ndepression?\u201d aren\u2019t exactly\nquestions easily remedied by ringing\nup NHS Direct and asking. This\nopera, though, strives to find answers.\nThis contemporary opera takes\ninspiration from Robert Burton\u2019s\n1621 textbook The Anatomy of\nMelancholy, which was the first\nserious discussion of depression and\nrenaissance medicine for melancholy.\nThe sole feat of transforming\nthis archaic text into a modern\nperformance deserves credit, and\ninspires hope that opera is not a dying\nbreed, but one that may find its own\nrenaissance through taking on a\ncontemporary form.\nEntering through heavy wooden\ndoors, the audience is led down a\ndimly lit warehouse-like hall into\na cavernous space more fit for an\nunderground nightclub than a\nconventional opera stage. Cracked\ntiles on the wall and cement pillars\nenhance the unorthodox setting,\nwhose raw, urban-decay \u2018vibes\u2019\nnaturally compliment and resonate\nwith the tone of the opera, rather\nthan appearing forced and out of\ncontext.\nThe opera \u2013 performed by a total\nof seven \u2013 weaves a fragmented\nexploration of the central figure\u2019s\n\u2013 the Son\u2019s \u2013 melancholy. The\nSon\u2019s depression is analyzed by\nthe Grandmother, the Father, and\na peculiar addition of the four\nhumours, each personified. Certain\nother stylistically distinct additions\nsuch as multiple large screens and\nan assembly of a hundred terra\ncotta warriors visually enhance the\nexperience, but a lack of plot and\ncharacter development is ultimately\na drawback.\nWhat makes this opera\nworth seeing are the vocals and\naccompanying score, both of which\ncontrast alluringly against the\ndimly lit underground setting. Six\nperformers provide a solid mix of\ntenor, countertenor, soprano, mezzo\nsoprano, and bass. The rich vocals are\nbel canto in the most traditional sense\nand \u2013 if not necessarily flawless \u2013 lack\nany painfully apparent weakness. The\neclectic range of instruments adds\ntexture to Benjamin Tassie\u2019s score,\nresulting in a surprisingly pure sound\nfrom the haunting accompanying\norchestra. Moreover, an expressive\nGran with a megaphone proclaiming\ndeep space metaphors will surely\nprovide enough comic relief to get\none through the opera\u2019s frequent\nobscure musings.\nIn terms of thematic\naccomplishment, however, the\nopera is not nearly as impressive.\nLike many contemporary art forms\nwhich aim to tackle a complex\nand somewhat abstract topic, The\nAnatomy of Melancholy orbits the\ncentral idea like an electron around\na nucleus, but never manages to\nstrike its core. Somewhat loosely\nwoven phrases and aforementioned\npseudo-poetic musings seem try-hard without accomplishing any\nElizaveta Tchebaniouk dissects The Anatomy of Melancholy\n\"The\necclectic\nrange on\ninstruments\nresult in a\nsurprisingly\npure sound\"\n\"The vocals\n& score\ncontrast\nalluringly to\nthe dimly lit\nunderground\nsetting\"\npurpose \u2013 aside from being crowd-pleasing due to their superficially\nconfusing nature. Though at times\naspects such as philosophical Goethe\ntexts and enlightening metaphors\nprovide the ability to penetrate the\ndynamic theme of depression, the\nopera remains, ultimately, grazing\nits surface. The ending is abrupt. The\nbaffled audience leaves with no more\nunderstanding of depression than it\nhad upon entering the theatre.\nPerhaps, though,in not providing\nthe audience with any concrete\nconclusions regarding the causes or\ncures for depression, the opera does\nindirectly and subtly accomplish its\ntask. In not defining the nature of\ndepression it does define the nature\nof depression for just what it is \u2013\nundefined, abstract, confusing, and\nuncertain.\nAnatomy of Melancholy ran from 22-25th\nOctober at Testbed 1, Battersea.\nThe Anatomy of Melancholy.

However,\nunless Orbital is shown to have really\nscrewed up somewhere, this shouldn\u2019t\nmaterially affect their future\ncontracts with NASA \u2013 rocketry is\nhard and \u201cvehicle anomalies\u201d like\nthese are an accepted feature of\nspaceflight.\nApart from Orbital, NASA, and\nthe human race in general, one of the\nbiggest losers in all this is Planetary\nResources, Inc., a start-up which\nultimately aims to mine near-Earth\nasteroids for valuable resources.\nThe Cygnus was carrying a\nminiature satellite (to be launched\nfrom the ISS) which would have\ntested systems for a new generation\nof asteroid-prospecting telescopes.\nPlanetary Resources remains\nresilient: in a recent statement, they\nassert: \u201cour development schedule has\nnot been affected\u201d.\nThe site of the explosion is still\nbeing surveyed by NASA and others,\nand it will be a while before we see\nany official description of what went\nwrong. Whatever happens, Orbital\nshould expect a lot of scrutiny to fall\non their use of (modified) old Russian\nNK-33 rocket engines.\nThese were designed in the late\n1960s and manufactured in large\nquantities for the Soviet Union\u2019s\nmanned moon programme which was\ncancelled after the USSR definitively\nlost the Space Race. The engines\nsat in a warehouse until the mid1990\u2019s when Aerojet (now Aerojet\nRocketdyne), an American aerospace\ncompany, bought the surplus (i.e.\ncheap) engines and reconditioned\nthem. These forty year-old engines\neventually found their way onto the\nAntares, prompting Elon Musk, CEO\nof SpaceX (which is Orbital\u2019s direct\ncompetitor in the private spaceflight\nindustry), to say in a 2012 interview,\n\u201ctheir rocket honestly sounds like the\npunchline to a joke\u201d.\nRight now, nobody\u2019s laughing.\nAntares Rocket taking off Photo: Associated Press\n\n"
