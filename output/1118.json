I 've had a terrible lab course, a lot of write-ups to fake and whole\namount of revision to plough\nthrough, as well as the day job, and\nso I decided to practise Critical\nPath Analysis by reviewing this\nalbum in my sleep. I started listening to it at eleven o 'clock on Friday\nnight, and by four am Saturday 1\nwas hooked on the electronic,\nsummery, sort-of sexy music produced by the strong female fronted\nband Peach. With her slightly flat\nvoice, Lisa Lamb is the perfect\naccompaniment to revision and lab\nTricky with his\nnew Marilyn\nMonroe wig.\nAfter listening to this, 1 was\nastonished by both the level\nof brilliance and of the sheer\ncrap ness that this album managed\nto achieve. I 've never been a fan of\nthe man, but his albums have\nalways provided me with two or\nthree choice cuts. This time\naround the said choice cuts are of\nreal quality but the rest are not\nreally worth the listening time.\nUnless you are a real fan, of\ncourse.\nAfter such a long time away (so\nlong that his own uncle is probably\na bigger star now) I didn't know what to expect. After listening to\nAngels With Dirty Faces, I'm still\nunsure about its actual content. As an album, it somehow manages to\ngo from one end of the spectrum\nto the other - with most of it at the\ndreadful end.\nMellow kicks the album off with\na wicked backing but it is ruined by\nTricky singing in a strange high-pitched voice; once he returns to\nhis usual whispering/rapping per-son a, the track salvages some respectability. The next track,\nSingin' The Blues is my favourite.\nIt, quite literally, sings the blues.\nTricky's female singing partner,\nMartina, features over a funky\nbacking and it is superb - it has to\nbe heard to be believed. Broken\nHomes features the talents of P.J. Harvey on vocals. The result is\neerie but works quite well. On the\nMoment I Feared, Tricky covers\nSlick Rick and the question is, sim-ply, why? This is awful and should\nhave been left well alone. Carriage\nFor Two pops up half way through\nthe the album and is very odd. It is\nvery slow and has those great\nwhispered vocals that create a feeling of real darkness in the song.\nThroughout the song, Martina sings the verse from Billie\nHolliday' s God Bless The Child\nand, this may sound strange, it\ncomes off well.\n1 was indifferent to this as an\nalbum. If you are a fan then you've\nprobably already got it but if you\naren't, then just buy the singles.\nLeave this album alone. H Milen\nreports, and I 've had the CD on loop all day. The music is extremely poppy and makes me want to\nput on my six-inch platform shoes\nand start dancing. I know that this\nis a bad idea, as I will fall and break\nmy leg, but there's something in the\nmusic that just makes me smile like\nan idiot. It must be that all the\nsongs are extremely un challenging, without any real meaning or deep\nfeeling. At heart, this album is hol-low. But, who cares? It's summer,\nthe sun is shining and I'm tired of\nangst-ridden, male-orientated, gui-tar-led music for naval gazers. This\nalbum has a light, frothy lemon-mousse, summery, sugary flavour,\nand I think it's great, in a slightly\nna ff and tacky way.\nI really, really wanted to slate\nthis CD. The cover shouts post-modern, pre-millennium pseudo-art at you, with its tasteful orange\nand cream photographs. The\nsongs are very sub-St Etienne EuroPop but without the satirical edge.\nThe single, On my Own, sounds\nlike Gina G covered by a bunch of\nhalf-witted schoolchildren... and yet, as a whole, the album is good. Like the Spice Girls and Bananarama, Peach grows on you. Sorry. E] Jessica Rabbit\nFat Boy Slim - The Rockefeller Skunk\nAlthough this song is a tad repetitive, it breaks up the\nmonotony by simply slowing it right down and then\nbringing back the tempo. This pretty wicked track is let\ndown by its continuous repetitions.\nAudioweb - Personal Feeling\nIt sounds like Audio web have decided to release a half\nhearted attempt at a strings-backed epic. This is a massive disappointment after the blistering assault of\nPoliceman Skank.\nArnold - Fishsounds\nThis is a feeble , boring and bland guitar strumming\njoke. The single cover just about sums the song up,\nwith a pathetically drawn phone. Why?\nQuest - Initiate the Creative\nIt started off with a promising latin beat but ended up\nturning into a hybrid of pop and soul that just grates\nafter a couple of listens.\nCartoon - Fade Away\nIsn't this such a clich ed title for an indie song? Well\ndon't be surprised because it is an indie song but a pretty mediocre one at that. 'Drift on the ocean and\nfade away ' Yeah, fade right out of my stereo.\nInsane Clown Posse - Hokus Pokus\nAre this lot meant to be a comedy version of Cypress\nHill. 'Hokus Pokus j oku s' is what you get for the chorus plus a cringe wor h ty fairground sample. Save it for\nHalloween guys.\nTHE ESSENTIAL CHOON Gomez - Get Myself Arrested\nThis is bluesy and laid back which is basically the recipe\nfor the perfect summer song. What is it with bands\nnowadays, glorifying criminal behaviour. What will be\nnext?\nEther - Best Friend\nPop is the only word to describe this. You get carried\nalong with the cheerfulness of it all as much as you try\nto resist. Sounding like a mutation between Squeeze\nand Wham can't be a good thing, but it won't stop you\nsinging along to it.\nPulp - A Little Soul\nThis is Back For Good isn't it? Are Pulp turning into\nTake That wannabes? d "

    "content": "NEWS 5 June 1998\nCollege Cash Bungs\nfor BMS Builders\nJEREMY THOMSON\nIC Estates Department is giving\nout cash bonuses to construction\nteam supervisors in a bid to get\nthe Bio-medical Building completed in time.\nA weekly prize of \u00a3 2 0 0 is being\nhanded over to the best foreman,\nas judged by a panel consisting of\nrepresentatives from Estates and\nSchal, the main contractors. A further \u00a3 1 0 0 0 a week is being set\naside toward a gigantic party on 15\nJune, subject to workers attaining\nweekly progress targets.\nNow in its fifth week, the\nscheme is intended to motivate\nsubcontractors whose work has\nbeen repeatedly undone as more\nand more changes to the original\ndesign have become necessary. So\nfar, \u00a34m has been spent on alter-at ions, often forcing work to be\nripped out and replaced. \"There's been an inordinate amount of fit-out adaptions - 60 or 70 rooms\nhave been affected\", explained Phil\nHilton, the project manager, \"it is\nde moral ising and frustrating [for the\nbuilders] so see finished, painted\nand plastered rooms being ripped\nout.\"\nThese alterations are pushing\nthe com pet ion date of the recently-named Fleming building back, leaving less and less time for the\nBiology and Medical departments\nto move in before term starts in\nOctober. The planned hand-over\ndate has moved from 13 April to\n\"early August\". Although unable to\ngive a defina te date, Mr Hilton told\nus that \"we are contracted to have\nthe building ready for undergraduate teaching on 1 October, and we\nwill\", although he did c once ed that\nit was getting \"close\".\nMore controversial is the funding for the scheme. According to a source close to the Estates\nDepartment, the bonuses were\noriginally intended to be \u00a3 1500\ncash, rather than \u00a3 2 0 0 . However,\nthere was \"deep concern\" over\nreal easing this money, and the college auditors had to be contacted.\nMike Hansen, however,\nappeared to be unaware of the\nspending. \"I know that it was dis-cussed\", he said, \"but 1 don't know\nany details. It's up to [lan] Caldwell\nand his team to build the building,\nand we'll just let him get on with it.\"\ni Imperial College Union\nANNUAL GENERAL MEETING\nToday, 1 2 . 3 0 pm. dBs. Your chance to:\nVote in officers for next year\nQuiz your sabbatical officers\n\u2022\n\u2022 \u2022 Preview the Annual Report.\nEverybody can turn up and vote, so BE THERE!\nStudents Dry in US\nUNCLE SAM\nStudents across the USA have\nbeen staging protests and riots\nlast month over alcohol bans.\nTear gas was used against a3000 strong group in Mitchigan, who pelted police after alcohol was\nbanned at a football match.\nThe legal drinking age in\nAmerica is 21 - a rule which is being\nenforced with increasing vigilance\nby campus police. Some universities have even banned drinking\naltogether.\nStudents caught offending are\nlikely to be arrested, not by the\nState Police, but by officers on\ncampus. These security guards are\nsworn-in police officers, and routinely carry 9 mm pistols. The\nUniversity of California (Los Angeles\nCampus) has 75 such officers, but\nSan Diego University goes further;\nofficers carry back-up handguns,\nand two patrol cars are fitted with\nprominent shotgun-racks.\nIC's own Chief Security Officer,\nKen Weir, when asked about the\npossibility of supplying weapons to\nofficers, said \"we considered\nbatons and handcuffs, but realised\nthat there'd be nowhere left on the\nbelts to put the Magnums.\" News in Brief...\nGOVENMENT\nDECLARE PARTY\nChris Smith, Secretary for Culture,\nhas announced an extra day's national holiday on 31 December\n1998. This means that there are\nnow four straight days across the\nmillennium in which to celebrate\nand recover, as Monday3 January\n2 0 0 0 is also a bank holiday.\nMANAGING\nMENINGITUS\nA new strata gy on managing\nmen ing it us outbreaks was\nreleased today by the Committee\nof Vice-Chancellors and Principles\n(CVCP). It encourages all universities to devise a strategy to deal\nwith the disease, which is two-and-a half times more common in\n15-19 year olds than the rest of\nthe populations.\nIts release follows the decision by Southampton University\nto vaccinate all fresher s this year,\nafter three students died there\nlast year.\nTUITION FEES\nREVOLT\nThe Prime Minster faces a potentially damaging back bench revolt\nnext week over the plans to\nimpose \u00a3 1,000 tuition fees on\nstudents. Labour MPs have held\nmeetings to encourage support\nfor what some fear could be a protest equal in size to the last\nyear's rebellion over cuts in benefit to single mothers, where one\nminister and four parliamentary\nprivate secretaries resigned and\n47 Labour MPs voted against the\nGovernment.\nSenior Government sources\nare anxious to avoid a repeat per-form ance, and, until now, believed that the Education\nSecretary David Blunkett had\ndone enough with a series of con-cessions. Opposition, however, is\nhardening against his Teaching\nand Higher Education Bill before\nits final Commons stages early\nnext week.\nRebels claim that the move\nflies in the face of Labour's support for free university education\nfor all.\nWhen added to plans to\nwiden the system of student\nloans, they fear students will face\ndebts of more than \u00a3 1 3 , 0 0 0 after\nthey finish their degrees.\nYou can read the bill in full at:\nwww.su. ic.ac.uk/Felix/1 118/bill.html\nTUBE STRIKE\nCHAOS FEARS\nFollowing an \"overwhelming\" vote\nby Tube members of the Rail\nMaritime and Transport Union,\nUnion leaders are to decide\nwhether to order industrial action\nacross London Underground. They are protesting over the\nGovernment's intention to part-privat is e the Underground system\nto raise billions of pounds in\ninvestment money. The leaders\nannounced their decision last\nnight, after emergency sessions\nall day yesterday.\nSome staff will be transferred\nto the private companies and\nwidespread job losses are feared.\nFeelings are running high among union officials, with some pressing for 4 8 - hour stoppages.\nIndustrial action was backed by\n2,471 members, with 462 against\nbut only 4 9 per cent of more than\n6,000 eligible staff returned their\nballot papers. Despite London Underground claims that Deputy\nPrime Minister John Prescott has\ngiven assurances on issues such\nas pay and working hours, RMT\nassistant general secretary Bob\nCrow said: \" We have been trying\nfor months to get the company to\ndiscuss these issues but they have\nrefused to do so.\" Industrial\naction by staff would seriously\ndisrupt rail services, and potentially cause chaos.\nNO FELIX FOR\nTWO WEEKS\nPlease note that the next issue,\nthe last of the term, will be issued\non Wednesday 24 June.

The 2-v1 bouts were\nfierce with Mike moving so fast\naround his two opponents that he left a trail of\nflames burning in the ring and Paul\ntaking a bit of a bruising from two\ntrained thugs. Next came the group\nsparring with opposition from Manchester and Wales. This event\nsaw Paul trying his best not to accidentally knock, people out with his\nlethal turning kick (unsuccessfully).\nAs bout after bout was fought and\nwon, the IC boys began to show\nthat it wasn't just big IQ's that they\nwere packing.

For a start, it is played by\nmixed teams. The baskets are\nmoved towards the centre of\neach half so that when you miss a shot, play continues. This happens very frequently as the baskets are higher than in either of\nthe other two games.\nBefore we knew what was\nhappening, we were in to the final\nagainst our old rivals Cambridge\nUniversity. The game went into\nextra time. After two minutes we had managed to creep into the\nlead 3-4, winning the club's third\npiece of silverware in 18 years.\nAnybody interested in taking\nup ko rfb all, contact the club pre s ident, Marcus( m. scott i@ ic.ac.uk) or see our\nweb page at:\nwww.ucl.ac.uk/~dmc brit/ ULKC/.\nCricket\nIC 1st were playing in the semi-final.

We then attempted England\n(cricket) style suicide as we lost\nseven wickets for about fifty runs\nbefore Graham rescued the team\nwith a sparkling 42 not out. Our\nfinal score of 158 - 8 looked\nrespectable but the gold was yet to\ncome. Raj started with a superb over\ninto the wind.

This man is a household\nname all over South East Asia and like Bruce and Jackie before him, Chow Yun-Fat is making that\nimportant leap into Hollywood.\nThe Replacement Killers is an\naction thriller with a simple plot,\nbut spiced up with high action.\nChow Yun-Fat (keeping dialogue to\na minimum in his first English language role) is an assassin who finally takes heed of his conscience\nwhen powerful underworld figure\nMr Wei requests Yun-Fat to be an\ninstrument of vengeance. Realising\nthat his defiance is worse than\nsmoking fifty a day, Chow Yun-Fat\nplans to return to China.\nNow requiring a passport, he\nmeets up with master document\nforger Mira Sorvino (surprisingly\nplausible portraying a tough cook-ie), and the whole film then goes\nballistic as Mr Wei sends a small\nd'.: army of men to tie up loose ends.\nAbove the guns and explosions\nthere are some good scenes, with\ndirector Fuqua, whose previous\nexperience lies in directing music\nvideos, has added an MTV flavour\nto the action sequences, using a car wash and a dance floor in key\nmoments. This Hollywood production tries desperately to have the same\nessence as Hong Kong action films.\nHowever its attempt to emulate\nJohn Woo's uniqueness, the sheer\nChow Yun-Fat: Cool or what?\nstyle and flair that Hard Boiled and more recently Face/Off have established, is way off. Towards the end of the film, The Replacement Killers\nlacks suspense in its action scenes\nand relies on cat and mouse sequences and heavy pyrotechnics\nto mask over an implausible con-clu sion. The Replacement Killers is like\nmaking popcorn - heat in a well\noiled pan, add the kernels and then\nwatch them explode. Dl\nMagpie\nTickets prizes galore courtesy of\nKENSINGTON\nT his week, five pairs of tickets\nfor US smash hit The\nWedding Singer are up for\ngrabs. Starring Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore, it's a trip through\nthe early eighties, complete with\nbandanas, mullets, and non stop\nnew romantics soundtrack. Get ready to relieve styles which I'm sure ew all want to forget.\nSo, without more a do here's this week's fiendishly hard ques-tion:\nWhich film links the stars of\nGood Will Hunting, Sphere,\nMichael Collins and Nixon?\nTo enter simply email your answer to film.felix@ic.ac.uk\nbefore Monday evening. Entries to\nany other email address will not be\naccepted.\nThe answers to last week's poser was: Renne Zellweger (Liar),\nI Maxwell Caulfield (The Real\nBlonde), Liv Tyler (That Thing You\nDo) and Robin Tunney (The Craft)\nall starred in Empire Records.\nThe first five correct entries out\nof my hat were:\nArosha Bandara\nEdwin Chang\nAdam Bettinson\n(.A. De Los Rios Medina\nBen Hedley\nPlease drop into the Felix office\n(in the NW corner of Beit Quad) to\npick up your prizes.\n15\n\u2022\nSTAR PROFILE:\nCHOW\nYUN-FAT\nC how Yun-Fat is one of the\nbiggest film stars on the\nplanet - yet unless you're a fan of the kind of destruction fest\nthat is the hallmark of Hong Kong\ncinema, you probably haven't heard of him.\nThis week, however, he aims\nto change all that, by emulating\nJackie Chan and hitting the\nHollywood big time. Quite why is\nanyone's guess, but the promise\nof mega pay days presumably has\nsomething to do with it. In his own words \" in Hong Kong the stunt is\nvery expensive and the star is very\ncheap\"\nHis fame owes a lot to a long\nterm collaboration with God-like\ndirector John Woo, with whom he\nhas made international hits such\nas Hard Target, The Killer and the\nA Better Tomorrow trilogy, and\nperfected his trademark \"tooth-pick chewing\". However, even\nwith such a high profile collaborator he has yet to make a real break\nin the English language market,\nwith his fan base primarily concentrated in South East Asia.\nHopefully, this week's release\nof The Replacement Killers will\nchange all that, showing Hollywood how to make action\nfilms properly - ridiculous body-count, idiotic cops, ultra violence,\nhideously scarred villains, and, most importantly, bucket loads of\nstyle.\nPrinciple Filmography:\nThe Replacement Killers (1998)\nPeace Hotel, The (1995)\nGod of Gamblers' Return (1994)\nTreasure Hunt (1994)\nAll for the Winner (1992)\nHard-Boiled (1992)\nFull Contact (1992)\nPrison on Fire II (1991)\nBlack Vengeance (1990)\nOnce a Thief (1990)\nThe Killer (1989)\nGod of Gamblers (1989)\nTriads: The Inside Story (1989)\nCode of Honour(1989) A Better Tomorrow111(1989) Fractured Follies (1988)\nChasing Girls (1987)\nPrison on Fire (1987)\nDragon and Tiger Fight (1987)\nCity on Fire (1987)\nA Better Tomorrow II (1987)\nDream Lovers (1986)\nBetter Tomorrow, A(1986) The Seventh Curse (1986)\nThe Phantom Bride (1985)\n\n"

Trying to work out this\n'dancing' lark, throwing myself into\nshapes that cause a concerned\npasser-by to enquire if I'm having a seizure. Decide to turn in my recently acquired dancing shoes\nand take up knitting instead. And then, and then.... The Only Rhyme\nThat Bites. Cheesy western sample\n(dunno which one, don't care)\npulling a ric tus grin around my face, feet finally achieving some level of synchro ny, the boy becomes a god. At least, that's how I remember it.\nWithout wallowing in nostalgia\ntoo much,808:98 is a timely\nreminder of just how bloody good808 State were. While sweeping\nthrough musical boundaries like\nthey were Swiss border check-points, they still managed to produce a succession of floor-fillers\nthat everyone loved. Cubik, with its\nangular melody and clipped beats\nis pure techno class while Olympic\neases your head open and smothers the synapses in Golden Syrup.\nOf course, their point is not that\nthey're back to rehash the old hits,\nbut to prove that they never really\nwent away, as the latter half of the\nalbum confirms.\nA plethora of collaborations are\npresent, from the laid-back Lopez\n(with james Dean Bradfield) to the\npredictably daft Bjork outing,\nOoops. Particularly good is Azura,\nwhich features the swoon some vocal talents of Louise Rhodes\nfrom Lamb, although it's not quite\nup to the standard of her regular\noutfit. One does get the impression of them cashing in on the\ncachet associated with being pioneers of a genre which has ultimately moved on sufficiently to\nrender 8 0 8 State somewhat obsolete.\nBut this matters little when presented with In Yer Face (which is),\nand Pacific State, featuring the\nmost memorable oboe riff ever.\nWho cares if they're still 'relevant'\nwhen they've got a string of such\nun arguably brilliant tunes to their\nname.\nNow, where didI put those\nwhite gloves? Aaaah, sorted. CI\nNorm\nHEADSWIM\nDespite Yourself \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nA little known fact about\nHead swim is that they started life as a dod gy metal outfit complete with long hair and tight\ntrousers. What happened, then, to initiate such a drastic change of\nmusic and style? Well in the words\nof vocalist Daniel Glendining ' we wrote some songs'. The songs in\nquestion are all packed with a raw\nemotion not heard of since the\nlikes of Radiohead, who are obvious influences. The two singles so\nfar, Tourniquet and Better Made,\nwere strangely ignored by the singles buying public, both only briefly\ngracing the bottom end of the top forty. This album definitely\ndeserves to do better.\nHead swim are amongst the\nnew set of bands touting misery as\nthe mood of the late nineties, a wonderful refreshing feeling for\nthose of us who occasionally feel\nlike punching lan Broudie in the\nface.\nThe power in the music comes from a combination of the extraordinary voice of Daniel Glendining\n(sounding similar to Sting, only bet-ter) and the harsh but ultimately\nbeautiful, melodious guitar ing courtesy of Daniel and the strangely\nmoniker ed Clovis Taylor.\nThe album is populated by a series of dark haunting songs each\none reflecting various aspects of\ndepression; Wishing I was Naive an\nemotion I think we all have some-times; Clinging to the Wreckage\nand the aching ly brilliant finale\nBrother as well as the aforementioned singles are definite stand\nout tracks, each one dripping with\npassion. Interestingly it is the more\nupbeat tracks which fail to strike a chord, namely Holy Ghost. This is\nthe only bad track on the album\nwhich flies by and leaves little\nimpression.\nThis really is an absolutely\nsuperb debut album which will\nhopefully cause Joe public to wake\nup, smell the roses and send Head swim to the stardom they\ndeserve. Head swim are the perfect\nantidote for those who have tired\nof OK Computer and desperately\nneed another dose of depression\nto remind them of just how bad this\nterm can get.\nFinally I'd like to thank Dave\nHellard for consistently handing his\nreviews in late and therefore forfeiting this album. Cheers Dave. CI\nAlex\nFirst there was Ash, then\nSymposium and now Midget.\nHere we have another typically cheeky and chirp y indie\nband, following the footsteps of\nmany before them. Midget, a band made up of three pre-pub es cent teenagers have brought forth\ntheir debut album, but have you heard of them? Surprising if not,\nas during the last year they've\nmanaged to put out around seven\nsingles.\nTheir latest single, The Day Of\nYour Life is set to hit the charts\nwith the force of a marshmallow,\nbut it's not bad. It's just that\nMidget are fighting for a hole in\nthe market that is barely visible.\nLike their peers, Midget seem to\nhave two modes. Loud and pace y or acoustic and cheeky. This contrast can clearly be seen in the two best songs of the album, The One\nWho Could Save Me and Canada.\nCanada rips through the verses\ncoming to a climax before slowing\ndown to a chorus delivered with\nthe softness of the lead singer of\nCatch. They try to tell you that\nthey're young and out for a laugh,\ntheir lyrics talking of unimportant\nthings such as alcopops and invisible balloons.\nYou can't really fault the album\nfor musical content, except for\nlack of originality. They have the\n'we're young and want to mosh' moods of Symposium, combined\nwith the quirky and youthful\napproach of Catch. Had they\nemerged two years ago, they\nwould have been seen as fresh,\nbut unfortunately they haven't, so\nall they can rely upon is that the\nyouth of today have the money\nand time to follow one more band\nlike this. CI David H Reviews are given a mark out of\nfive as follows...\nDrinking Beer\nBBQ s Sunshine\nHolidays\nLazing around\nNo Stars Exams\n\n"

    "content": "COLUMNS oV STARS 5 June 1998\nTom Smith's letter, on\nbehalf of Third World First,\ncannot go unanswered. For\nthose of you that skipped\nthe letters page in a frantic effort to\nget straight to my humble prose, the\nAssociation of University Teachers\nhave passed a motion to promote\n'ethical' investment by the\nUniversity Superannuation Scheme,\nthe lecturers' pension fund. This, as\nTom pointed out, was first raised a few months ago, and I had my\ndoubts. I still do. These objections\nwere principally practically, suggesting that the fund's investment\nreturns may fall, a view that was\ncountered with 'it doesn't matter\nbecause the pension is guaranteed.'\nTrue, insofar as the pay out s are\nfixed at a fixed proportion for every\nyear of service, but if the returns dip,\nsomeone will have to pick up the\ntab. This is most likely to be the\nemployers or the government, but\neither way the shortfall cannot simply be met by magic. In the end, we\nall pay. Tom is right in saying that\nthe pension funds wield considerable influence, but the USS's \u00a313.5\nbillion is relatively insignificant in the\ngrand scheme of things. Pension\nfunds do exert influence, but this is\nprincipally used to maximise shareholder value, not political trouble-making. The notion that the USS can\nchange the world is nonsense.\nIn order to invest 'ethically',\nTom suggests that it will be necessary to invest in smaller companies.\nIgnoring for the\nmoment the imp lii cation that all large Qj\ncorporations are \\y tyrannical mon j^> \u00bb\n00\nmonsters determined\nto destroy the\nworld, it may be\ntrue that small,\nniche companies\nmay be more likely to satisfy the\npolitical agenda of jc o00H the AUT. However, his suggestion that such investment can\nlead to higher returns is very mis-leading. 1 agree that if you manage\nto pick the next minnow about to\nturn into a whale, the profits will be\nspectacular, but the chances of getting one's fingers burnt increase\nexponentially. This is not the way\nthat a responsible pension fund\nbehaves. Following Tom's advice,\nethical investment soon becomes as\nprudent as five card stud.\nMoreover, smaller companies have\nsignificantly under performed the\ntop 100 companies over the last\nfew years. Given the choice\nbetween shares in Glaxo or at in pot mac ram e outfit, Ir \u2122n| know where I'd put my cash. In\n^ (\"^ his quest to save\n' ty^ the world from\ncapitalist r**j* exploitation by\n) the West (social-ism and environmentalism are\n\u2022\nnever far apart),\nTom forgets the\nS* \u2014^\" ethical question\nf\"+ of playing fast\nand loose with\nthe pensions of Britain's lecturers. If\nthings went spectacularly wrong, we\nwould all suffer. It is not acceptable\nto engage in gesture politics in this\nmanner, and 1 hope that the USS\ntrustees see sense.\n[The editor would like it to be\nknown that he doesn't agree in the\nslightest - see editorial]\nElsewhere, we have had the first\nConservative reshuffle since the\nelection, and it seems to have been\nvery sensible. Peter Lilley is more\nsuited to the deputy leadership,\nwhere his policy-making skills will be\nused to greatest effect. The promotion of Anne Widdecombe to\nShadow Health spokesman is\ninspired. At the risk of stating the\nobvious, the woman is terrifying.\nFrank Dobson must be praying for\nBlair to reshuffle, because she will\nwipe the floor with him. Frank, bless\nhim, is not the sharpest tool in the\nbox, and any reluctance to change\njobs must have instantly evaporated.\nFinally, not one week after I sang\nthe praises of the recent Ante Room\nexhibition Now it appears that\nsomething very wrong is occurring.\nThe windows have been covered\nwith Bacofoil and flashing lights\nhave been observed inside. I fear\nthat some poor soul feels this is art,\nbut there are other explanations.\nEither Sherfield are beginning a programme of mass hypnosis or we've\ngot the builders in.

There are, and always will\nbe, people so deeply selfish and mercenary that they don't care\nwhether they are personally funding and hence supporting torture,\nmurder and war. These people are\nthankfully in the minority, and were\ntheir actions to be seen directly,\nthey would probably be branded as\n'evil' by society. Yet, oppressive\nregimes thrive, millions are exploited to the point of death and the\nplanet is being sacked beyond possibility of recovery, all in the name\nof profit for the average investor\n(ie. all of you reading this article).\nSo why do we, fair-minded and conscientious people, continue to actively promote such atrocities?\nSimple - ignorance. None of us\nknow what our money is being\ninvested in, and further more we have no way of finding out.\nTake, as an example, the night-banking system operated by virtually all British banks. After the close\nof business at the stock exchange\nand the closure of the banks for the\nevening, the colossal sums of\nmoney contained in ordinary current accounts is amassed and invested overnight in Eastern\nexchanges. It is then returned (with\nprofit) the next day, with no-body\nany the wiser. You may find it surprising that even the shiny new 'ethical' banks such as The Co operative bank indulge in this dubious practice.\nWhat, then, can be done to\nprevent our money being used to\nsupport causes with which we'd rather drill holes in our head than\nbe associated? Notice that at the\nbeginning of this article I did not\nsay that money itself was causing\nthese problems. Money is a tool,\nand a powerful one at that. If ordinary investors wish to change the\nfruits of their investments for the\nbetter, then it is the money itself\nthat should be used as the lever. If\ninvestments trend towards ethical\nschemes and away from those\nproven to be immoral, then you\ncan be damn sure that the banks\nand investment agencies will be\nfalling over each other to provide\nsuch opportunities.\nTrue, most of us invest comparatively little, and hence our\nleverage is small (but NOT neglig i ble). This is why the success of the\n'Ethical investment for the USS'\nscheme (see page four) is such\ngood news. Not only, does it have\nthe extra credence of being a state\ninvestment scheme, but it also\npacks a \u00a3 1 3.5 billion punch. This is\nmore than a start - it is part of the\nsolution.\n[Simon Baker would like it to be\nknown that he doesn't agree in the\nslightest - see column]\nSmall Ads\nTasha Newton, ICU ac com mod ation officer, wants to hear from\nanyone who has ever had problems with an intercollegiate hall.\nContact Tasha for any accommodation problems on 0 9 5 8 7 0 7 41 5\nor n. newton@ic.ac.uk.\nCitroen AX 14 TZS For Sale\nE Reg, e/w, lots of history, new exhaust and front shocks, full dealer service and MOT last\nNovember, \u00a3 1 0 0 0 ono a.bet tin son@ic.ac.uk or phone Adam on X57121.\n2 x RAM BDX80 Decks\n+ 1 Soundlab DSM15 mixer.

    "content": "12 MUSIC 5 June 1998\nCLUBSCENE - COMPETITIONS\nICARUS - Kamikaze\nRelease Date : 1st June *\nW hen handed this CD to\nreview, I was worried -very worried. What with\na weird alien-cum-human on the\nfront cover and an artist by the\nname of Icarus, I expected some hour-long assault of Drum & Bass\nthat was the soundtrack to the Xfiles movie.\nThe press release told me to listen in darkness, but shit-scared I listened to it in the blazing sunlight\nsurrounded by numerous implements - ready to repel the devil if\nhe came.\nThankfully, he never did, and an\nhour after starting, I was glad to say\nthat all had changed was my perception of what D'n'B is.\nIcarus are cousins Ollie Brown\nSam Britton, and this is without a doubt as fierce as a debut album\ncomes.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nThe first tune, Moon Palace is a dark and mysterious affair.\nThroughout the CD Drum 'n' Bass\nnormality is suspended, and the\nduo's shared love of mathematics -p hew there's still hope for me yet\n(But sadly not those on Joint Maths fk Computing!) - architecture and\nindustrial development sites leaves\nnothing to the imagination. Okay,\nso pythagorean identities don't come flying at cha in tune 3, Agua\nPara Mis Abuelos but the influences\nof the ruff bassline and melodic\ntones lead to seven minutes of\nseductive ness. Xenotransplantation is as weird\nas it sounds - a laid back, spooky\nintro giving way to twisted beats\nbefore submerging into a tirade of\nelectronic sounds. Yum! Baggage Claim, the last track,\ntakes musical styles far beyond the\nusual D'n'B parameters - having an\nalmost techno feel to it, and all\ntracks link in superbly - highlighting\nthe skill in this duo's soundtrack\ncomposition.\nMoth exhibits a haunting, dou ble bass cityscape feel, and the\ncrashing, hypnotic Gordon Detail\nmerge to add yet another more\nthan worthwhile dimension to the\nRecordings of Substance label.\nChris\nSimply Electric.\nMixed by Force &. Styles iri rir This is not a cheesy mixed compilation of 4-beat / happy hardcore\nanthems as you may think, but consists entirely of Force fk Styles own work, quite incredible. I didn't realise how many of the biggest\ntracks over the past years where\ndown to these two. Although it gets\na bit too cheesy for my taste buds\ntowards the end, it starts out in fine\nstyle with some of the duo's earlier\nwork that even I 've got from a few\nyears back. So if you like your\ndance music fast and sometimes\nhectic - uplifting with plenty of\npiano action and stomping basslines in a hardcore fashion this\nshould be right up your street and\nbring back plenty of memories.\nMogwai. Kicking A Dead Pig\n(Eye Q) Nice title, this album is a collection\nof remixes of Mo gwa i's work by the\nlikes of Hood, Max Tundra, Klute,\nDJ Q and even Mo gwa i himself.\nPlenty of originality all pretty much\non the experimental side of things.\nPacked full of novel ideas and\nclever little touches - but of limited\nappeal due to this experimental\noften dark and sometimes plain\ninsane. Tracks like Helicon 2 starts\nout with a minute of mind bending\nnoise that isn't at all pleasant.\nApart from the odd harsh crazy\ntrack this album is quite dreamy\nand trip py but a little too minimal\nfor most. If your interested in making electronic music of any sort this\nis well worth checking as some very\ninnovative ideas on display.\nAnion Tobin. Permutations\n(Ninja Rec) * * l/2 You won't find this one under easy\nlistening - quite the opposite in\nfact. The reason for this is that the\nwhole album borders on the side of\nexperimentation, trying new idea\nsome that work and others that\ndon't. Some of the tracks are challenging to listen to even sounding\nabrasive and distorted. I feel this is\nwhere the problems lie.\nWith Amon trying too hard to\nbe different, the majority of listeners would simply not bother\nfighting through the first few\nstrange tracks to the more, dare I say, normal tracks further into the\nalbum. Like Sordid &. Nightlife a clever little DfkB number that I couldn't really see working in a club\nset but fits perfectly with the\nalbum, Escape is a track that is crying out for a full on DfkB mix if you ask me, loads of clever samples\nand fx just too minimal on the beat\nfront.\nInfluences from Jazz, Blues,\nhip-hop, samba DfkB and even\nBatucada are pretty obvious with\ntracks like Switch which is a jazz\npiano intro with whaling trumpet\netc joining in with computer fx over\nthe top I Overall I was disappointed with\nthis album there are some good tracks here and plenty of clever\nideas but sad ley they are in the\nminority.\nJo Public\nWhere We Check What's In The Front Of Top DJs* Record Boxes.\nr What's In The BoxDJ Scott Garcia (Garage)- Top 20\n1.

    "content": "14 FILM 5 June 1998\nTHE GENERAL\nStarring: Brendan Gleeson, )on Voight, Adrian Dunbar\nDirector: John Boorman*** Vi\nThe Irish - a very peaceful people. No, honestly.\nC all me a cynic, but after John\nBoorman won Best Director\nfor this film at Cannes, 1 was\nsomewhat sceptical about going to\nsee it. You see, the views of those\nwonderful people at Cannes don't usually agree with mine. This time,\nhowever, I was pleasantly sur-pri sed... The General was produced for\nan absurdly small budget (even by\nBritish standards), secured almost\nentirely on the basis of Boorman's reputation, and is shot entirely in\nblack and white. In a not wholly\nunoriginal format, the film begins\nwith the final scene and then retrospectively chronicles the life and\nworks of the infamous Irish criminal\nMartin Carhill, aka. The General.\nPlayed by Brendan Gleeson,\nCarhill's story begins with his childhood on one of the poorest estates\nin Dublin, where he spends his days\nstealing food and escaping the Irish\npolice (the Garda). Coupled with\nthe nostalgic black &. white filming,\nthis generates a sympathy for the\ncharacter which, as the story\nunfolds, appears undeserved.\nEndless conflicts with the\nGarda, time in a Catholic borst al with the inevitable molestation,\nand then time in jail fuel Carhill's growing animosity towards author-it y. Indeed, at times his whole life\nappears to be a non-stop battle to\ninsult, harass and embarrass the\nGarda.\nIt is here that the only fault with\nthe film appears. It combines a portrait of a gangland criminal, with\nacha rica ture of a loveable rogue,\ntesting the audience's loyalty to\nsomeone who was after all a bad\nand dangerous man. This is easily\nforgivable though, as the dark\nscenes are suitably dark and the\ncomedy suitably funny. The odd loose end here and there doesn't detract from the film either.\nStrong performances by\nGleeson and Jon Voight, as the\nGarda Inspector always one step\nbehind Carhill, along with great\nsupport in the form of Carhill's( rather intriguing) family and gang,\nkeep the audience engrossed.\nGreat cinematography just puts the\nicing on what is already an\nadmirable cake.\nMy only advice to anyone going\nto see this film (and I recommend that you do) would be not to\nexpect a big climax. This is after all\na true story - the life of a man who,\nas a criminal (albeit a legendary\none), had too much faith that he\nwould never be caught. D Reuben\nAFTERGLOW\nStarring: Julie Christie, Nick Nolte, Jonny Lee Miller, Lara Flynn Boyle\nDirector: Alan Rudolph\nRepair men eh? When they're\nnot charging you a hundred-and-fifty quid to replace a washer on a bank holiday, they\nenjoy nothing more than seducing\nlonely housewives with the subtle\ncombination of a cocky grin and a little plumbing related innuendo -or so we have been led to believe\nby thirty years of British situation\ncomedy. However, on the evidence\nof Afterglow things aren't so different in Montreal.\nNick Nolte plays Lucky Mann,a repair contractor whose easy going\ncharm presents him with ample\nopportunity to break his wedding vows. His improprieties become understandable when we are introduced to his wife Phyllis, played by\nJulie Christie. She is a former Bmovie actress who spends her time\nreminiscing about her past with the\naid of tapes of her old films and the\nodd gin.\nDespite Nolte' s good humour ed attempts to heal the\nobvious rift in their marriage, Phyllis\nseems to derive some sort of\nmasochistic pleasure from her\nwoeful situation.\nConversely, Jonny Lee Miller\nhas all the outward trappings of\nsuccess - a salary large enough to\nlive in a ridiculously flash apart-ment, and to keep his beautiful\nwife, Lara Flynn Boyle, in all the\ndesigner frocks her heart desires.\nHowever, Miller is too wound up in\nhimself to spare any time for his\nslightly neurotic wife who has little\nchance of fulfil ing her wish to have\na baby.\nFour clich ed characters languishing in two dysfunctional marriages isn't the most lively of open-in gs, and the entirely expected\naffair of Nolte and the attention\nstarved Boyle lends little freshness\nto the proceedings. An unlikely\nsymmetry is completed when the\npursuit of the unfaithful pair brings\nMiller and Chrisstie together.\nCaptivated by the older woman, Miller offers her an indulgent ear,\nand eventually we learn of the\npainful episode on which she is\ndwelling.\nThe film goes on to relate the\nconflicting and often ill-defined\ndesires of the principle characters.\nUnfortunately, Afterglow frequently\nends up as confused as they are.\nChrisite's self-absorbed melancholy\nbecomes too irritating before we\nlearn of it's cause, and Miller's executive boredom is exceptionally\ngrating. His assertions that he is\nonly 'excited by the impossible'\nmerely succeed in making him\nsound even more juvenile. In fact,\nthe characters are so unsympathetic that any interest in them dwindles to mild curiosity pretty rapidly.\nPerhaps the only saving grace\nis Nick Nolte's assured perform ance. His portrayal of Lucky,\nbeing forced to question his easy\ngoing outlook is far more convincing than Julie Christie's overacting.\nAfterglow is an unusual film, but its\npurported insights into human\nnature are far too vague to constitute anything other than hollow\npretension.

    "content": "5 June 1998\nCb? 4 LETTERS\nLetters to Felix,\nUSS SUCCESS\nDear Jeremy,\nI would like to remind everybody about the 'Ethics for USS' campaign that Imperial got a taste\nof at the beginning of the year.\n'Ethics for USS' has received\nwide support from lecturers across\nthe country. The national\nAssociation of University Teachers\n(the largest lecturers union) has\nnow, almost unanimously passed a motion in support of 'Ethics for\nUSS' and individual lecturer support\nis growing all the time.\nThe largest single investors on the stock exchange are the pension\nfunds. USS, the 'University\nSuperannuation Scheme' invests\nabout 13.5 billion pounds a year in\nindustries around the world. This\ngives the pension fund investors\nvast amounts of power and influence in the way that public companies and multinationals are run.\nEthics for USS is a campaign\ncalling on the University\nSuperannuation Scheme to adopt\nan 'Ethical investment Policy'. It\nwould currently be impossible to invest that much money using any\ntrustworthy ethical investment cri-teri a, so the campaign calls on the\nSuperannuation Scheme to use their in flue nci al power to change\nthe operations of unscrupulous companies in which they invest.\nThe greatest irony in the pension system is that the pension of\nevery individual is invested on the\nstock exchange for maximum return. In order to ache ive maximum return for their shareholders\n(ie. Pension funds), companies are\nmore likely to disregard the Environment, and anything that\ncosts them money such as their\nown employees. Currently we are\nseeing the 'Corporatisation' of\nUniversities which gives us less\nchoice over what we research and\nlittle say over what is done with our\nwork. This 'cyclic' chain of events\nmeans that unless employees( public and private) take a stance to\nbreak the chain by investing their\npensions ethically, they are their\nown victims.\nAlthough investing 'Ethically'\ninevitably means investing in smaller companies, there is evidence to\nsuggest that spreading money in\nthis way gives better return, apart\nfrom which, USS pensions are guaranteed anyway, which means that\nyou can't do yourself ANY harm by\nsupporting this vital campaign.\nFor more information, Iam available at t.c. smith@ic.ac.uk or\nalternatively contact 'Third World\nFirst' (contact details below) to\npledge your support. At least twenty five IC lecturers already have.\nCheers\nTom Smith (Physics UG2)\nHOUSE OF HELL IV\nDear Felix\nFollowing a rather nasty flood\non Tuesday, I have compiled a list\nof anti-flood precautions:\n1. If you live in the top of a Victorian\nterraced house, make sure the\nlandlord has the gutters cleaned\nout regularly.\n2. Notify your landlord if you see\nwet patches in the ceiling after\nheavy rain. Unless it is a hole in\nthe roof, then the gutters need\ncleaning immediately.\n3. If you are unlucky and water\ndoes come in, you MUST turn\nthe power off at the main fuse\nSTRAIGHT AWAY as the water\nwill come through the light\nfixings first.\n4. If the water is really pouring in,\nyou need to make holes in the\nceiling (with knife or a screw-driver) everywhere that is wet.\nWater will gush out of these\nholes and make a dreadful\nmess, but if you don't then the\nceiling will collapse and make a much worse mess.\n5. Move coursework and notes first\nbecause everything else is covered by insurance.\n6. Make sure everything is dry\n(including the inside of sockets)\nbefore turning the power on.\nIf you are considering renting a top floor flat, look at the ceiling very\ncarefully. Ask about any staining or\nloose wallpaper near to outside\nwalls.\nOther clues are different types\nof wallpaper in the same room or\nonly rooms along one wall being\nfreshly painted. Don't be fobbed off\nby the landlord saying that it has\nbeen sorted out. It needs doing\nseveral times a year.\nI know this seems like overkill\nbut had I not been in on Tuesday\nmorning, I would have returned to\nfind my books, notes and computer\nruined and wet plaster over every-thing. Even so, I still jump out of my\nskin at the sound of running water!\nAbigail Hops on, Chem2 FELIX HASN'TA CLUE\nSir,\nWhy has ISIHAC (I'm sorry, I haven'ta clue) been placed as the\nbottom mark in last weeks music\nsection? ISIHAC has been a popular\nradio panel game for almost 2 5\nyears. I would like to say it is as\nfunny today as it was 2 5 years ago,\nbut since I'm only 20, I can't really\ncomment. It does however have a large lise ner ship, who regularly tune\nin to hear the manic and often surreal games played by the panellist s. ISIHAC regularly hosts talents\nsuch as Tim Brook Taylor, Paul\nMerton and Samantha.

FINAL ISSUE - 24 JUNE\nBack at Last\nTricky's Latest\nAlbum Reviewed\nColour\nExtravaganza\nUnion AGM Ends in\nFarce\nMARK BAKER\nLast Friday, the Annual General\nMeeting of Imperial College\nUnion was was dramatically\ninterrupted by student Andy\nSouthern, who halted the meeting as less than 200 students\nwere present. The normally sedate\naffair at which the annual report is\napproved, officers are elected for\nthe next academic year and the\nstudent body is given an opportunity to quiz their elected\nSabbaticals was dogged with problems from the start. Due to a major\nevent in Beit Quad the Andersen\nConsulting Pit Stop Challenge - the\nvenue had to be changed to the\nUnion Dining Hall at the last\nminute, leaving some attendees\nconfused.\nThe meeting initially proceeded normally, with Natasha Newton\nre-elected unopposed of accommodation officer. The position of\ncouncil chair, also chair of the\npowerful executive committee, went to Andy King after ex-ICU\nPresident Eric Allsop withdrew his\ncandidacy. After much discussion\non tuition fees, Simon Lewis was\nelected as Equal Opportunities\nOfficer. There were no candidates\nfor the posts of RAG Chair and\nTransport Officer, and so these\ncould not be elected at the\nmeeting.\nRene Frank, a Biochemistry\nPostgraduate, was the only candidate for Welfare Officer and fielded a barrage of questions. Before\nthe meeting could move to a vote,\nAndy Southern, a Mechanical Engineering student, shouted\n\" Quorum!\" and so forced the closure of the meeting, as around 6 0\nstudents were in attendance rather\nthan the required 2 0 0 . Mr Southern's actions were evidently\nunpopular with those who had\nmade the effort to attend, as a cry\nof \"You tw at!\" and similar comments were voiced.\nIn a letter to Felix explaining\nthe reasoning behind his actions,\nMr Southern stated that he did not\nhalt the meeting out of spite,\nclaiming \"Ido not hate the union,\nor resent it.\" Instead he insisted\nthat the meeting had to close \"in\nthe interests of the student body\"\nas there were not enough people\npresent. Mr Southern cited insufficient publicity as being the chief\ncause of the lack of student inter-est, laying the blame squarely at\nthe feet of the members of Council.\n\"They don't want students to\nattend the AGM,\" he wrote, before\ngoing on to suggest that sabbat i cal's performance would be\nimproved if their actions were\nquestioned more often.\nIn response, ICU President\nAndrew Heeps said \"publicity for\nthe AGM was put up around the\nwalkway and the Union on the\nMonday; however members of\nCouncil have had the date since\nNovember, therefore having the\ninformation to pass to their con-st it u enc ies.\" To the claim that he\nhad not done enough to publicise\nthe AGM, Mr Heeps commented that \"it is impossible for us to go into every lecture theatre, and the\nJCR to remind people about the\nAGM.\" However he did not think\nthat it was a total failure, as \"8\ntimes as many more people turned\nup this year than last.\" Indicating\nthat the months in office have not\nyet stripped him of his humour, to\npublicise the next AGM he said\n\"perhaps I should go to the top of\nthe Queen's Tower, and shout\nabout it.\"\nThe rescheduled AGM takes\nplace today at 12:30 in dBs. The\nfollowing posts will be elected;\nWelfare Officer, Transport Officer\nand RAG Chair. Anyone interested\nin standing for these positions\nshould sign up opposite the Union\nOffice in Beit Quad. The presentation and approval of the ICU Annual Report will also occur at the\nAGM this Friday lunchtime. All are\nvery welcome to attend.\nThe full letter from Andy Southern can be read at the Felix\nweb site - www.su.ic.ac.uk/Felix/\nLast Friday afternoon,\nBeit Quad was livened up\nby the appearence of a Williams-Renault Formula\nOne car. Students were\nchallenged to perform the\nfastest wheel change. It\nwas won jointly, at 14.22\nseconds.\nPhotos: David Roberts\n\n"

    "content": "16\nHELD IN SUSPENSE\nARTS 5 June 1998\nA CHORUS OF DISAPPROVAL\nAlan Ayckbourn\nIt's that time of year again. As Spring slowly grinds it's way into\nSummer, and most people's heads are full of differential equations, nematodes and quantum mechanics, the motley crew that is\nDramSoc take it upon themselves\nto relieve of us our misery, if only\nfor a few hours, by performing a beautifully acted and wonderfully\nset play. This year, they've chosen\nan excellent play, A Chorus of\nDisapproval, an eighties Alan\nAyckbourn, about the trials and torments of an amateur operatic soci-e ty. It is eye-water ingly funny and\nincredibly moving when read as\ntext, and with the support of a powerful cast, should spring into\nlife and become a masterpiece.\nThe plot centres around a production of the Beggars Opera by\nJohn Gay, and features such memorable characters as Dafydd, the\nWelsh producer, Hannah, his long-suffering wife, Linda, the petulant\nadolescent, Ian and Fay Hubbard,\nthe swinging couple into wife-swapping parties and a little blackmail on the side, the seemingly inebriated Rebecca Huntley-Pike and\nthe slightly bemused Guy, the newcomer whose presence seems to\njar all the protagonists into action,\nalmost without his knowledge or\nconsent. Messageless, this play\ntakes stock characters that we will\nall instantly recognise, places them\ninto a situation where their behaviour becomes inevitable, and sits\nback and watches them work. The\nplay seems effortlessly written, the\ncharacters exist, they do not appear\nto be the product of someone's imagination. This is a play almost\ntailor-made for a student company,\nand as such cannot go wrong. The\nwriting is faultless and as the majority of the characters are typecast, it\nshould be exec ellen t. Do go and see this, it will cheer\nyou up if you've had a bad exam,\nand will relax you after all the stress\nof this term. As John Gay wrote in\nthe final song of the operetta, \"The\nWretch of To-day, will be Happy\nTo-morrow\".\nJulia\nAn Arts Editor Writes....\nDespite this college being at the\nforefront of scientific, medical and\ntechnological research, people here are woefully narrow-minded\nwhen it comes to the more avant-garde forms of art. Certain people\nhave eloquently criticised the exhibitions in the Ante Room Gallery,\nin particular the 22 club over\nChristmas, and some people are\nunaware of the presence of such a gallery in college at all. Yet despite\nthis, despite the apathy towards\nart, I never expected such a conservative attitude from some of\nthe most forward thinking people I know.\nWhen the last exhibition\nappeared, I popped in to see it,\nand was struck by the soulless ness and the sterility of the paintings.\nThey were extremely well-exe cut ed, but surely to be a successful\nartist, you need to express something of yourself in your work; it\nseems pointless otherwise. People\ndon't become artists because they\nfeel like it, they have to do it, their\nwork is their driving force and\ngood painters express this be a uti fully. The list of genuine, spiritual\npainters is endless. Even some of\nthe artists in our own gallery have\nbeen good, those who exhibited\nOffice Party, a series of paintings,\ndrawings and sculpture, which I found extremely enjoyable.\nPerhaps Mr. Baker missed that\none.\nTo write \"I never thought I would have a good word for the\nAnte Room exhibitions,\" indicates\nan astonishing level of arrogance\nand narrow-mindedness. Admittedly, some of the work has not\nbeen good, some of it has been\ntruly dreadful, not \"the work of an\neducationally subnormal gorilla\",\nbut not great art either. The \"paint-in gs[ of] obvious form and artistic\ninsight\" so praised by Mr. Baker\nwere soulless, sterile, puerile and\nbanal. They gave nothing even to\nthe casual viewer, and would not\nhave stood up to intense scrutiny.\nTo be a good draftsman does not\nmake you a good artist. To be able\nto reproduce a tree or a vase or a scene with a hill and a cow does\nnot indicate talent or innovation.\nMr Baker is entitled to his own\nopinion, of course, but I personally would rather see an exhibition\nwhich showed even a hint of\ninsight than that sort of tacky\ngreetings card art.\nTHE POWER OF POSTER\nV&AT he Power of Poster exhibition\nhas been on for quite a while\nat the V&A.1 visited it about\nfive weeks ago for the first time\nand liked it so much that I went\nagain last weekend. It is really\nsuperb.\nThe exhibition is divided up into\ndifferent themes. First one strolls\nthrough the theatre posters with\nsome of Toulouse-Lautrec's designs for Paris at the beginning\nof the century. There are also some gorgeous Japanese pieces. The\nnext room has lots of music related\nposters and covers ranging from\nHerb Ritts's photo of Madonna for\nTrue Blue to David Hockney's beautiful poster for Parade, an opera-ballet in New York, The film section\nshows again a lot of diversity:\nChaplin's early films stand next to\nthe poster of The Bodyguard. One then moves onto the more political\nside of posters. Propaganda is the\nkey word; pro-army (mainly the\nUS), anti-war, Mai68 in France,\nRussia....\nIn this section there are some\namazing works: Keith Haring's painting for a apartheid free South\nAfrica, Saatchi and Saatchi's pregnant man promoting cont race p tion, the posters about women's right of vote. This is particularly fascinating since it is the illustration of\nprogress and man's preoccupations over these past 100 years: all\nthe big themes are present.\nOne then moves on to the\nproper commercial side of posters:\nadverts for p to ducts like Guinness,\nBisto and Bovril and a few works by\nMuch a the Czech artist.The last\nroom hosts a few more recent\nposters including the hilarious\nSmirnoff ones and the controversial Benetton advertisements.\nThis exhibition shows lots of\ndifferent functions posters have\nhad over the years. In a way it is a brilliant picture of our times and\nsays a lot about our fears, our ideas\nand our dreams. It wouldn't be surprising if these posters have influenced History. They certainly help\nto shape our everyday tastes, what\nwe buy, what is cool, .where we\ngo, perhaps even who we talk\nto...These things do have incredible power as the name of the exhibition suggests. The key to it is the\nposter the V&A have designed for\nits promotion. I had a great time\nwalking through it and enjoyed it\nimmensely the second time round\ntoo. I definitely recommend it.\nD. CORNELIA PARKER\nThe Serpentine Gallery\nT his is the first major retrospective of Cornelia Parker's career. As one of Britain's best contemporary artists, al j her\nexhibits have a feeling of matter\nheld in suspense. So, for example,\nshe has a large work consisting of\nsilverware, run over by a steamroller and suspended a foot from\nthe ground, entitled thirty pieces of\nsilver. This might not sound that\nimpressive, but it is. The work that\nhas gone into producing this piece,\nthe dedication it shows is quite\nbreathtaking. Everything seems to\nsuggest that if you had been here\nyesterday, you would have seen\nthe bullet go through the dress,\nseen the lion savage the bowl, seen\nthe wholeness that has been\nreplaced by the incompleteness.\nShe presents us with a fait ac com pli, and we must fill in the deed\nwith our imaginations. My favourite\nexhibit were the figures made from\ncoins run over by a train, hung from\nthe ceiling in the shapes of people,\nmoving slightly in the breeze, as if\nthey were breathing. This is a remarkable exhibition, and will\nmake you think deeply about the\nway we view objects. It is worth\nseeing, it's free, it's up the road and\nit's very, very good. What more can\nyou ask for?\nJulia\n\n"

It is a venue which allows for rather more\naudience involvement than most\ntheatres. It was rather unfortunate\ntherefore that I never quite\nengaged with the characters and\ndid not feel the need to shout\nabuse/encouragement at them. There was, nonetheless, some audience participation but it felt\nrather fake.\nBeing a' ground ling' has its dangers (and not only severe backache\nfrom standing up for three hours),\nthere was fighting in and through\nthe audience as well as various\nactors making entrances through\nthe pit - in one case sending an\nelderly member of the audience flying backwards into the crowd. In\nthe Sixteenth Century the\nground ling s were liable throw rotten fruit at the actors; modern\naudiences tend to be slightly more\nrestrained, though they may have\nto duck flying vegetation coming from the direction of the stage.\nThe Globe runs the risk of\nbecoming a tourist attraction rather\nthan a serious theatre space if people go there for the sake of the\ngoing to The Globe instead of going\nthere to see plays. I was therefore\ndelighted that this production was\nof such high quality. The humour of\nthe piece was really brought out\nand depth and subtlety were\napparent in many of the characters,\nI felt I knew what they were thinking all the time - even when they\nsaid nothing.\nThe only problem I really had\nwith the play was the ending,\nwhich is very hurried and contrived,\nbut it didn't really matter. Mind you, I could have done without the\nseventy year old God of Marriage\ncoming on at the end in just a beard, antlers and a pair of birds\nnest pants!\nTom Dane\nITS COMING HOME, ITS COMING HOME...\nEA SPORTS : WORLD CUP '98\nElectronic Arts - PC / Playstation / N64 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nsSH MB gB Maw it e as B W MM BMi j BiB riR i Was*- l gfr Hurrah, the World Cup is about to\ninterrupt what would be otherwise\nan appallingly empty summer.

The ISS\nrelease has yet to make it out for\ntraining but FIFA WorldCup'98 is\nout on the pitch warming up. The\nPC version demonstrated on a top\nPentium 2 system with a Diamond Monster II card stormed out like a world cup winner. The graphics\nwere superb, most of the England\ncrew actually looked like their\nnamesakes, and t jie rather fluid\nmotion capture system has been\ndesigned to mimic specific moves\nfor certain players - though my complete lack of knowledge of the\nBrazilian team did prevent me checking this out. The expected\nfootball sounds cape as found on\nTV is all there, from crowd roar to\ncommentary from such experts as\nDes Lynham and Chris Waddle( obviously for penalties). As for the\ngameplay, well should you grow\nbored of England winning the final\nfor the twentieth time there is\nalways the option of playing as an\nhistorical team such as the England\n1966 team, Brazil 1970 or\nGermany 1990's teams.\nAs football games go it is the\nbest yet, not quite the \"pissing into\nthe eyes' of the opposition\" that\nPC Zone said it would be, but a step above the previous titles.\nWould I buy it?

Using\nthe glove is actually easier than\nexpected. Flexing the wrist controls\nthe directions, while the buttons\nare on the tips of your fingers.\nThere is as you would expect a slight weirdness with this but the\ndesigner says that it soon becomes\nalmost pleasurable.

We do not even have\nthe comfort of knowing that insurance companies will be paying the\nbills... Where do you reckon this\npiece of literally ground-shaking\nnews should end up in any self-respecting newspaper? Front page\nheadline, perchance? Well, the\ntabloids didn't think so. In fact,\nMonday's edition of a certain popular tabloid ran as follows: pages\none to five - Hoddle's expulsion of\nPaul Gascoigne (bring on Owen, I say); two full-page promotions; a page 3 girl generously showing her\nrear to the world; a full-page ad; then stuck between an article about\na man who wanted to get married\nin prison and a banal piece about\nsomeone who managed to get free\nentrance to see Scream 2 were\nthree column inches about a certain minor earthquake somewhere\nin some poor country. And three\npages about Ginger Spice.\nWhen you consider the much publicised bickering of rock\ndinosaurs Oasis, who are still largely intact, and then compare it to\nthe relatively strife-free career of\nPosh, Ginger, Scary, Baby, Sporty\nand Turmeric, you would be forgiven for thinking that Girl Power\nwould live forever. This was almost\nbelievable, given that the Fab Five\nwere one of the few manufactured\nbands to actually work their socks\noff. Since their chart-topping beginning with Wannabe, their faces\nhave been everywhere, whether\nyou like it or not: sponsorship\ndeals; two albums; television\nappearances. They put the split\ndown to artistic differences, but\nperhaps after all this time in each\nother's company, Geri is as sick of\nthe sight of the rest of them as a lot\nof us seem to be.\nHaving said all that, credit must\ngo to them for going for broke.\nHistory suggests that the lifetime of\nsuch a canned pop delight is not\nlong, and they seemed to realise\nthat getting as much money as\npossible in as short a space of time\nas possible was the way forward.\nLook at laughable teen legends\nBros: probably just as much of a phenomenon as the Spices. The\ndifference lay in their attitude to\nthe media. Bros didn't bother much with it, although sponsorship deals\nwith second-hand clothes shops\nflogging ripped jeans, contracts\nwith Grolsch, or, more likely, agreements with hydrogen peroxide\nmanufacturers, would all have been\nvaguely possible. Conversely, the\nnumber of Spice-sponsored products expanded seemingly without\nlimit, as more and more greedy\ncorporations longed for a grinning\ncheeky face on the front of their\nlatest line of toenail clippers. When Bros split up, they found themselves in serious trouble with\nAmerican Express: when Geri left\nthe Spice Girls, they were worth\ntens of millions of pounds each.\nIncidentally, Craig Logan, ex-Bros\nbassist, made the sensible move;\nlast I heard he was managing\nNeneh Cherry, while the other two\nare still desperately trying to make\ntheir fantastic comeback records.\nThey will probably make more\nmoney by signing on. So if the next big teen thing are\nreading this (admittedly not likely,\nunless the Calculus Boys are signing as we speak), remember that\nyour fans will be distressingly fickle.\nOne day, probably sooner than you\nthink, they will grow up.\nAli Campbell\nWoter\nSalads\nDespite the usual post May monsoon season\nI'm carrying on with my summer theme. This\ntime I'm looking at the delicate and often controversial topic of salads. Now salads can be\nbased on may things: lettuce, tomato, rice,\npotato, couscous( see Felix 1115) etc.\nHowever, they must be fresh and the ingredients MUST be of top quality because that's where the taste comes from.\nSo, experiment, mix and match and re mem ber that lettuce does not just mean iceberg\n(which in my humble opinion has to be the most\nuninteresting sorry excuse for a vegetable that\nI 've ever come across). There are dozens if not\nhundreds of different lettuces even if you can't get them all in the supermarket. Cos, chicory,\nround, fri see, oak leaf, red oak leaf,s carol le, cress and I could go on. They're all available\nover here and they're all excellent.\nTo help ali this greenery go down and also\nto complement the simple uncooked vegetable\ntastes, it's usual to add some sort of dressing to\na salad. I 'll go through the instructions for the\ntwo most common and then a short bit on\npotato salad which is far too simple and tasty to\nmiss out.\nFrench Dressing\nPut 1 level tablespoonful of smooth french\nmustard, preferably from Dijon, and the same\namount of wine vinegar into your salad bowl.\nAdd some freshly ground pepper and a pinch of\nsalt. Mix these up thoroughly crushing the salt\nso it dissolves. There's a lot of blah about only\nusing a wooden bowl and spoon but I 've always\ngot good results with any old bowl and a metal\ntablespoon. Next, drizzle a small amount of oil\n(say about 1 cc for the scientific amongst you)\nand stir this into the mustard until it is completely incorporated. Then add a little more oil,\nstir, more oil, stir, more oil etc. It is essential\nthat the oil is fully emulsified each time before\nTypical IC student, meet lettuce. Lettuce,\nyou are no longer safe.\nyou add any more or it will just separate out\nlater. Once you have used the equivalent of 2\nt bl oil you can pour the rest of it in more rapidly but keep stirring vigorously. You'll need to use\na total of around 6 tablespoons of oil (i.e.6 parts oil to 1 part mustard to 1 part vinegar) but\ntaste the dressing when you've finished and\nadjust the seasoning as they say.\nMayonnaise\nFor this one the state of the bowl IS imp or tant. I like using a ceramic one because there is\na lot of stirring to be done and a good thick\nbowl won't move around too much. It must be\nspotlessly clean and dry. A possibly useful trick\nis to make sure all the ingredients and the bowl\nare at the same (room) temperature. Gently\ncrack an egg and separate the yolk, removing as\nmuch of the white as possible. Plonk the yolk\ninto the bowl, add a small tablespoon of mustard and mix together well. The process is basically the same as for french dressing, mixing in\nthe oil drop by drop and making sure it is completely mixed in before adding any more until\nyou have a fairly substantial amount of mayonnaise at which point you can start adding the oil\nin more rapidly. One egg yolk is enough for\naround 2 0 0 ml of oil so don't be shy. You know\nthe mayonnaise is ready when you can make it\ninto sharp peaks by pulling the spoon out. Stop\nadding oil and mixing at this point. It's usually a good idea to add something acidic to a mayonnaise just to counterbalance all that grease. A couple of t bl of vinegar or lemon juice should\ndo the trick\nPotato Salad\nWash but do not peal 2 lb new potatoes.\nCut them into bite size pieces and cook in simmering water until just tender. Finely chop a shallot and slice a stick of celery. Put all the\nabove in a large bowl, sprinkle generously with\nsalt and ground pepper, a dd45t bl of olive oil\nand mix well.\nDear me, the stress of these recipes!\nAntoine\n\n"
