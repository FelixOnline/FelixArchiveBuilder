    "content": "President's report\nWelfare\nThe house hunting information pack is now ready and\navailable to all those students about to look for\naccommodation. The information pack contains\nadvice on where to look for accommodation, how to\ndeal with landlords, what to look for in a contract and\nhow to protect your tenants rights.\nMyself and Yve Posner, the Union Welfare Adviser\nand author of the pack, will be holding two housing\nadvice clinics where the pack can be picked up and\nquestions answered on housing issues. The first of\nthese will be held in Linstead Hall Dining Hall at 7pm on Wednesday May 30. The second will be held in the\nBasement of Southwell House, Evelyn Gardens at\n7pm on Wednesday June 6.\nThe pack is also available from the accommodation\noffice and the welfare office.\nMy thanks go to the following people who helped\nin the production of the pack:\nYve Posner-for researching and writing the whole\nthing.\nRose Atkins-for typesetting the pack.\nAndrew Thompson-for printing the pack.\nDavid Smedley-for coordinating the above efforts.\nEverybody from Council of 14.5.90 for hand\ncollating the 4000 packs.\nNightline\nWith continued pressure on the University of London\nUnion it now looks likely that Nightline will be\naccommodated in the ULU Building. This solution,\nalthough better than being booted out on the street,\ndoes not solve what I see as the more important\nproblem: that of the operation of Nightline. College\noriginally took the decision to evict Nightline on two\ngrounds:\n1. The College wanted the space and felt that it was\ntime for the other colleges who benefitted from\nNightline to shoulder the burden of housing the\nservice.\n2. Because one of its staff, Mr Malcolm Aldridge,\nwas acting as the Treasurer of Nightline and because\nthe Nightline Steering Committee met infrequently it\nwas felt that College was picking up too much of the\nadministrative burden.\nIn taking the decision to evict Nightline the College\nappears to put more thought into the colour of toilet\nroll it uses than into the effects of the eviction. Certain\nkey personnel instrumental in executing the eviction\norder have done less than bugger all to help Nightline\nin their operations. In this comment I am principally\nreferring to the Rector who has, instead of using his\nown influence upon Senate and neighbouring\nprincipals, asked me to do his dirty work by asking\nme to force the issue at ULU. This I had no intention\nof doing. It is about time College learnt a little about\npublic relations.\nThere are several advantages to Nightline in moving\nto ULU. The premises are secure and it is centrally\nlocated which makes it easier to recruit volunteers\nfrom the many colleges around that area. It does not\nhowever solve the problem of how to run Nightline\nand the persistent problem of ensuring that the\ncolleges receive the service pay for its upkeep.\nNightline was originally set up at Imperial College\nafter a spate of suicides by IC students. Since then\nit has grown to become a counselling service to many\ncolleges many of whom pay a contribution to help run\nthe service. In some ways I had hoped that alternative\npremises would not be found and thus force the issue\nwith a Rector that has been totally thoughtless,\nunconstructive to the extent of being almost\ndestructive, and totally ignorant of the welfare of his\nstudents.\nHaving said all that, thanks must go to the more\ncaring members of various colleges: Mr Bob\nWestaway, IC Registry; Mr David Goodgame, IC\nSenior Tutor; Mr Eran Gill, Nightline Coorindator and\nMrs Anne Conlon, Chair of Nightline Steering\nCommittee.\nTransport\nThe deadline for van applications for the summer\nvacation is today (24.5.90). Allocations should be\ncompleted by Tuesday (29.5.90). Seeing as we have\nhad several problems this year with people booking\nvans and then not having eligible drivers to drive them;\nlet me explain a couple of things:\n1. All drivers must be over 21.\n2. All drivers must hold a full-clean driving licence.\n3. All drivers must have passed a mini-bus test.\nTests can be booked with the Union van testers all\nof whom are full-time students so don't expect a test\nat two hours notice!! Indeed at this time of year they\ntend to have exams so please leave yourself plenty\nof time to arrange a test.\nParking and traffic\nOver the last week I have received several complaints\nabout the developments taking place under the Huxley\nBuilding. The complaints emanate from owners of\nvehicles that were parked in the area previously set\naside for cars, motorcycles and push-bikes. I first\nheard of these developments only a few days ago\nwhen I received minutes of Parking and Traffic\nCommittee, held in March, that I unfortunately could\nnot attend. I have several comments to make:\n1. Notice of the works and the necessity to remove\nvehicles from the area was only posted one week prior\nto the works commencing and took the form of a single poster displayed at the entrance to the area.\nFor a college management structure that is trying to\nimprove communications around College this is\npathetic. What about the person who happens to be\naway doing research for a couple of weeks and\nchooses to leave their bike under cover in a secure\nplace, how are they likely to find out about the\nproposal to 'skip' their valuable possession? Only\nthanks to some members of RCSU have several bikes\nbeen rescued from the College's intentions to scrap\nthem!!\n2. The minutes of Parking & Traffic Committee\n20.3.90 assures me that the 50 motorcycles to be\npermanently displaced from the area could be\naccommodated in the covered motorcycle shed\noutside the RCSI building. This certainly doesn't appear to be the case since the metropolitan police\nhave informed several owners of bikes that they are\nnot allowed to park their bike there.\n3. Proposals to relocate the pedal cycles also appear\nin the minutes; yet how have the powers to be\ninformed the users of cycles?\nHouse Hunting\nInformation & Advice\nLinstead Hall Dining Hall\n7pm Wednesday May 30\nAND\nBasement of Southwell House\nEvelyn Gardens\n7pm Wednesday June 6\n\n"

    "content": "More\ncoming out\nDear FELIX,\nI have finally gained the courage to admit a secret\nI have been carrying around bottled up inside of me\nfor 21 years, and I have you to thank for it. In recent\nissues of FELIX, the courage of other members of IC\nin 'Coming Out' has given me the strength to do so\nmyself. So here it is, I am a loony, raving, flaming,\nflamboyant, 100% heterosexual. I love women, their\nsmells, kisses, legs, bums, boobs, voices and minds.\nWomen, I love you all!\nPhew! What a relief off my mind, I always felt I may\nbe unnatural or perverted, but I feel better about\nmyself already. I just hope all my friends in Imperial\nCollege will respect me in the morning and that I won't come to any bodily harm for admitting what I actually\nam. Do you think my parents will be understanding\nin this matter?\nWell, thank you again FELIX for giving me the\nstrength to be straight with myself.\nYours faithfully,\nAndrew Collins, MREII.\nNo more!\nOpen closet\nDear Dave,\nI view the airing of details of people's sex-lives in\nyour pages with mixed feelings. Take Jason\nFitztightly's declaration that he is gay for instance. My\nfirst reaction is 'good' because that's one, maybe\ntwo, out of the race (why anyone should want to beat\nhim up for it is beyond me); but then I wonder why\nhe is telling us. Does he get a kick from advertising\nhimself? What's wrong with the Personal column?\nThe slight vicarious pleasure at the news that\ngorgeous pouting Norma Snockers was bon king on\nthe roof is overshadowed by regret that it wasn't with\nme; furthermore, the FELIX revelations mean that she,\nor her like, probably won't do it again. Discretion is\nthe better part of valour, Dave.\nHowever, since the precedent has been set, I should\nlike to announce my own fetish...I get off on seeing\nmy letters published in your organ...\nyours auto-erotically,\nAdrian Redgers, PG Neural Systems, Elec Eng.\nP.S. whoever it was that said that \u00a310-15 was very\ncheap for a prostitute obviously doesn't live on a grant.\nPlease direct any correspondence, hate mail, or dirty\nphone-calls to Mr Adrian Redgers, 52 Wrottesley\nRoad, London NW10 5YG. Telephone: 071-589 5111\next 5215 (work) or 081-965 7375 (home).\nDave,\nMy article contained nothing but pure fact, with\nnothing added and guaranteed 100% in\u00b0'curacy free.\nAlthough it outlined only the more up seung effects\nof the bill, it was not subject to any embellishment,\nemotive, irrational, ridiculous or otherwise. Harelip and\nclubfoot were common grounds for abortion under the\nold law, and this is unlikely to change now.\nI was pleased to see the considered, reasonable\nresponse from Ian and Amy. It is a shame Ms Hardy\ncould not have been similarly rational in her reply, in\nwhich, ironically, she accused me of being unduly\nemotive.\nAnyone wishing to question any aspect of the\narticle can contact me via Elec Eng I pigeonholes, as\nI understand you would prefer further debate on this\nmatter to take place outside the pages of FELIX.\nIrrationally yours,\nRob Crompton, IC Pro-Life.\nMamby Pamby\nDear Dave,\nI was thinking about ways in which recent crowd\nviolence at football matches could be curbed and\nwondered if most students agreed with my remedies:\n1. Instead of the 'Namby Pamby' community service\n(which is so often dished out to these thugs) let's give\nthese hooligans hard labour. Let them break up rocks\nrather than peoples' heads!\n2. National Service for all those over 18 for eighteen\nmonths. This would inject badly needed discipline into\na large number of 'soccer scum'.\n3. Removal of passports for a limited amount of time\nif involved in crowd trouble, home or abroad.\n4. Reintroduction of corporal punishment. The idea of\na16 stone PC wielding a birch would certainly deter\nme!\nThese 'people' are not real football fans. They are\nusing football as a vehicle for violence which they are\ntransporting across the country and abroad.\nIt is only with severe measures, like points 1. to 4.,\nthat we will ever be allowed back into Europe again.\nI do however criticise the Europeans for closing their\neyes to soccer violence in countries like Italy, Holland\nand Germany. One reason may be that they know, if\nallowed back in, that England would show itself to be\nthe best footballing nation in Europe as it obviously is.\nI'd be interested to hear the views of my fellow\nstudents.\nYours sincerely,\nAlan Bailey, Chem Ian ardent Chelsea fan).\nBATSMEN\n&\nBOWLERS\nthe IC B2's need both!!\nSocial cricketers for friendly\nfixtures throughout the summer\nContact:\nJohn Herrick: ext 5985\nAndy Clapham: 081 543 4494 (eves)\nMick Sumra: 071 228 1292 (eves)\nSmall Ads ADVERTISE IN THE FELIX SMALL ADS SECTION\nFREE IF YOU ARE A MEMBER OF IMPERIAL\nCOLLEGE UNION\nANNOUNCMENTS\n\u2022 Kensington Committee for Overseas Students\nwill be holding a Grand Raffle Dance on Saturday\nJune 2nd.

    "content": "Heat of the city\n'Industry is losing graduates to accountancy and the\nCity' we are told. One only has to glance into the\ncareers fair to realise that there is some truth in this.\nMost of the big accountancy firms are present, but\nwith little representation from the City, most people\nare left in the dark as to what 'the City' might be. This\napparent reluctance to advertise itself is curious when\nthe accountancy firms are delighted to explain the\nsublime pleasures of auditing...\nThe reason is that the international banks in the City\ntypically receive 50-100 applications per job. This is\na big headache for personnel departments, and\nadvertising only serves to make things worse.\nThis still leaves a problem for undergraduates\nwishing to obtain information about careers in finance.\nThe popular media presents archetypal yuppies as\neither Oxbridge graduates or barrow boys who have\nhit the big time. They are paid a stack to shout 'buy'\nor 'sell' at random intervals and insider deal\nthroughout the day. They then drive at high speed in\na Porsche to the wine bar and spend the evening\nbowling, whilst smashed on champagne.\nThis is a very amusing image, but totally useless.\nTo obtain a realistic picture, the careers centres here\nat Imperial and ULU are good places to start. They\nstock pamphlets, career profiles and company\nbrochures, although these go missing quickly because\nnot many are sent out. Even the reference copies\noccasionally 'disappear'. ULU also has cuttings from\nthe financial press.\nHowever this is still an outsider's view. The only\ntime one can obtain a real insight into what actually\ngoes on, without being under pressure of interview,\nis on a special course run by the University of London\nCareers Advisory Service, called the 'City Course'.\nThe course costs \u00a315, and lasts from Monday to\nFriday in the week immediately prior to the start of\nthe autumn term. This is cheap compared to a similar\ncourse run by the Financial Times which lasts three\ndays and costs \u00a3700!\nThe course consists of a series of informal\npresentations in the offices of different financial\ninstitutions, such as international banks,\nstockbrokers, management consultants and various\nfinancial exchanges. This year's programme is listed\nbelow.\nThe presentations begin with an outline of what the\norganisation does, current areas of recruitment,\nfollowed by what each job entails and any special\nskills or requirements for that role. Then there is some\ntime to speak to recent graduates. It is not a formal\ncareers presentation, so they can tell you the way it\nactually is, and you can ask them awkward questions\nlike 'Do you enjoy your job enough to compensate for\nhaving to wake up at 5.00am, be under pressure all\nday, and have practically no social life except at the\nweekend'.\nApart from all this careers information, the course\nI attended was interesting in itself, with visits to the\nfloors of various exchanges during trading hours,\nincluding the Foreign Exchange money market dealing\nroom of an international bank. Also in the programme\nwas a discussion with a financial journalist and, for\nsome reason, a speech by the Lord Mayor of London\nin the Mansion House.\nAt the end of the course, everybody had a greatly\nimproved knowledge of what the various careers in\nthe City were, and whether they were actually\nattracted to them. The companies who attended were\nkeen to interview students, having hired similar people\nin the past.\nFor anyone who might be interested in a career in\nfinance, the 'City Course' offers an invaluable insight\ninto what really happens, giving you ahead start over\nother applicants and enabling you to make a rational\ncareer decision, based on fact.\nApplication forms are available in the careers library\nnow.\nPeter Miller, Physics 3.\nw Monday 24 September 11.45 Peter Tudball\u2014Shipping Thursday 27th September\nLocation ICA 12.15 All to view Baltic Floor Location--Guildhall Library\n1.15 Group A Lunch at Baltic/Group B9.30 Register Lunch at Lloyds 9.45 Lord Mayor\n10.00 Working in the City in the 1990s2.30 LIFFE/Panel 10.00 Town Clerk\n10.45 Coffee 4.15 Tea 10.30 Coffee\n11.00 Andersen Consultancy-IT 4.30 Broker/analyst and Stock Exchange 10.50 Bank of England\n12.30 Lunch Speaker 11.00 The role of the Bank in the City\n1.30 Lawyers & Solicitors 11.45 Panel of Graduates\n2.15 Building Society Wednesday 26th September 12.30 Lunch\n3.15 Accountants Location -Hong Kong Bank 2.00 Merchant Banking\n4.00 Move to Touche Ross? 3.00 Leave for Lloyds Bank\n4.30 Trapper Game 8.30 Register 3.30 Tea\n6.00 Reception 1.00 Lunch at Hong Kong Bank/American 3.45 David Wydenbach\nBank 4.30 Lloyds Business Game\nTuesday 25 September 2.15 American Bank 6.00 Reception\nLocation -Baltic Exchange 3.00 Midland Bank International\n9.00 Video 'One Lime Street' and 4.30 Move to Nomura Friday 28th September\nCharles Flaxman 5.15 Nomura Location -Chartered Insurance Institute\n10.00 Depart for Lloyds of London 6.30 Reception\n10.15 Visit Exhibition and Gallery 9.30 Catherine Sweet, Charthouse Bank\n11.00 Coffee at Baltic Exchange 10.30 Ernst & Young Consultancy Game\n11.15 To be arranged Livery Hall Lunch\nPage 9\n\n"

    "content": "Tense, nervous headache ? Drinking too much ? Exams looming upon the horizon ? With help\nfrom Sez Wilkinson and Rhydian Hapgood, Union Welfare Officer, Jackie Scott, explains that\nyou 're probably suffering from...\nStress at Imperial\nAt this time of the year, stress is at its peak, but what\nis stress, and how do we keep it under control to\nprevent it affecting our work?\nStress is experienced when external demands meet\ninternal resources. These demands can be physical-six flights of stairs to your hall room, when the lift is\nout of order, that leave you panting for breath, with\nlegs like jelly!! But we are also subject to emotional\ndemands, which must be met by emotional\nresources-the exam-time being the most obvious.\nThese demands lead to stress.\nStress is not always bad. It goads us into activity,\nand gives us the impetus to meet the challenge to\ncomplete a given task on time. But, if the deadline is\ntoo close, or the challenge too great, the stress levels\nrise until they become disabling and the task does not\nget done.\nAny task has an optimum level of stress arousal\nwhich creates the impetus for doing the job but when\nthe stress goes beyond the optimum level, the task\nsuffers.\nWe cannot avoid stress (most certainly not during\nexams at Imperial!!. In fact, to be under-stressed\ncreates its own problems. We must find the optimum\nstress level, to ensure we work efficiently and also\nsafeguard our health. Too much stress not only\nprevents us from working effectively, but it brings\nwith it stress-related illnesses.\nStress claims to be one of the biggest twentieth\ncentury killers, directly linked to heart disease and\ncancer, responsible for 75% of all illness in Britain\ntoday. It costs about 40 million working days each\nyear, and accounts for 50% of deaths in men over 40\nin Britain. Stress-related disease is now so prevalent\nit is estimated to cost the medical and social services\nan average of \u00a355 million a year-two or three per\ncent of the gross national product.\nThe problem however is not so much stress, as a lack of effective stress control.\nThe Chinese have two characters in their alphabet\nwhich together depict the concept of crisis. They link\nthe symbol of danger with the symbol of opportunity.\nIn every crisis there is the danger of breakdown, but\nthere is also opportunity for stimulation and growth.\nStress and examination performance are linked\nthrough the effects of stress on study habits. There\nare three basic approaches to study:\n1. Surface learning\nThis emphasises note-learning of facts, motivated\nprincipally by fear of failure.\n2. Deep learning\nThis involves an understanding of the underlying\nconcepts, motivated by interest and a personal need\nto know.\n3. Strategic learning\nThis selectively applies surface and deep strategies,\nmotivated by a desire for success.\nPage 6\n\n"

If we don't get this sign wired in soon,\nthis man's going to collapse,' shouted Beandick.\n'There's a Birthday Party in the Citizen's Office.

    "content": "Theatre Theatre\nAbsurd Person Singular\nA few years ago my uncle was mayor of Tewkesbury,\nGloucestershire. Conservative naturally. He'd go to\nsee an Alan Ayckbourn play because he'd think it was\n'Right Wing Theatre'-ie there'd be no lesbians,\nsuppressed ethnic minorities or inner city deprivation\nthrust down his throat. But he'd be wrong because\nAyckbourn is a playwright with a social conscience-Okay, he hasn't set any of his plays in an Earls Court\nbeds it, but at least the middle-class scenarios he\ninvents are not without a distinct moral message-Ayckbourn is 'Left Wing Theatre' par excellence.\nAbsurd Person Singular is a tale Of social mobility.\nIn the first act we see Sydney and Jane Hopcroft's clinical fitted kitchen where no cup or saucer dare\nventure out of place. It's Christmas Eve and Sydney,\nwho could only be described as a social climbing o ik, masterminds the perfect drinks party during which he\nbrown-noses his socially superior guests-Geoff (an\narchitect) and neurotic wife Eva, Ronald (his bank\nmanager) and alcoholic wife Marion and Dick and\nLottie Potter, two tremendously jolly friends who we\nnever see but whose presence we can always sense.\nNeedless to say the evening does not run absolutely\nsmoothly and there are several laughs to be had on\nthe way, but this is nothing compared to the second\nact which perhaps is one of the most memorable\npieces of Ayckbourn you'll ever see.\nThis is set a year later in Geoff and Eva's homespun-look kitchen. Prompted by the adulterous Geoff's decision to shack-up with his girlfriend, Eva spends\nthe entire act in silence devising an astonishing variety\nof ways to commit suicide. Ayckbourn skillfully\nmanipulates the audience so that instead of\ncontemplating the horrors of taking one's own life\nthey are rolling in the aisles as the other characters\nunwittingly thwart Eva's suicide attempt with\nhilarious consequences.\nThe third and final act is set another year later in\nRon and Marion's Victorian kitchen. Marion has finally\nsuccumbed to her alcoholism and has taken to her bed\nwith several gallons of gin while Ronald is sitting in\nthe kitchen, reading dirty books and wondering where\nit all went wrong. Geoff and Eva arrive, marriage\nrestored but career ruined when one of Geoff's Clarissa\nThe second of seven new operas by British composers\nat the English National Opera (ENO) had its world\npremiere at the Coliseum last Friday.\nClarissa is originally an eighteenth-century novel by\nSamuel Richardson, one of the longest in English.\nRobin Holloway composed his operatic version of\nClarissa fourteen years ago 'in a storm of passionate\nexcitement with the subject' (ENO producer David\nPoutney). Although the novel is complex and full of\npsychological insight its very story is as simple as\n'man wants girl; she resists; he rapes her; she dies'\nas Holloway tells it.\nClarissa Harlowe is confronted with her family's wish for her to marry the unworthy and ridiculous\nScrewtape. Although a dutiful daughter she resists as\nbest she can and desires to be left single ('Who\nindeed, (...) would marry, that can live single?'). Her\nfamily tries to persuade her to marry, and as she\ncontinues to refuse, her father finally curses her.\nClarissa flees with the help of the libertine and rake\nLovelace.\nSoon she discovers that she is trapped again, this\nPage 4\nprojects goes disastrously wrong, for a quick\nphilanthropic Christmas drink. But when Sydney and\nJane arrive uninvited and full of Christmas cheer, due\nto the success of Sydney's building business, the\nother characters are compelled to literally dance at his\nfeet, the outcome reaching an almost nightmarish\nlevel. At this stage of the performance the distinctly\nHome Counties audience, who had been laughing\nsolidly all the way through, were jolted back again into\nsocial reality.\nBut Ayckbourn also focusses on the three different\nmarriages and how they are far from ideal, in fact\ntaking his plays as a whole (all 35 of them) you can\ncount the number of perfect nuptials on one hand.\nWhile Sydney bullies Jane into despair, Geoff and\nRonald both neglect their wives either through\ninfidelity or just a plain lack of communication. He also\nshows how people throw metaphorical swords at\neach other. Just like kids in a playground who exploit\nevery chink in their class-mates' armour, grown-ups\nare not that much different, they just disguise their\nblows with words and social etiquette.\nAbsurd Person Singular is definitely one of Alan\nAyckbourn's best plays in so much that the script is\nnever flabby and that even if the worst theatrical\ncompany on earth played it you'd still get a loads'o 'laughs. Ayckbourn himself directs this\nproduction and un surprisingly brings out all the comic\nnuances mainly because he wrote them. So one would\nexpect a fine production with a maximum laugh rating.\nAnd yes, at times, its excruciatingly hilarious but\nthere's no excuse for having the actors ham it up bit\njust for a few cheap laughs. For example he has made\nsocial climbing Sydney so repugnant that you just feel\nlike getting up on stage and putting the poor blok e out\nof his misery. That said, Moira Redmond's portrayal\nof the drunken Marion was quite side-splitting and\nalthough the T.V. production a few years ago was\nsuperior, if you've never seen this play GO SEE.\nIncidentally, my uncle would like it as well, but don't let that put you off.\nThe Whitehall Theatre Box Office is on\n071-867-1111 and student standby's are \u00a36.50.\nAdrian Pagan.\ntime in a brothel where Lovelace has put her up. By\nstaging a fake fire out of Clarissa's locked room (fire-breather Toby Davies almost sets the Coliseum on\nfire!) Lovelace intends to appear once again as the\nselfless rescuer. But Clarissa escapes.\nThe frustrated Lovelace awaits her recapture.\nMy Sister\nNext Door\nOpportunity. We all need one to give us a start in our\nlives. What if someone sacrifices theirs to give you\nyours-and you blow it? Take two sisters. The elder\nworks in a building society, a steady reliable type,\nalways aware of the duty she owes to her family. She\npasses up opportunities to further her career, to help\nher father and send her younger sister to a dancing\nschool-an extremely tacky and exploitative school.\nHow does she feel as she approaches middle-age,\nunmarried and un promoted? The younger sister goes through dance school and\nthen lives a life of performing in seedy nightclubs,\nearning jobs and money in a way that verges on\nprostitution. Her sole sense of duty revolves around\noverblown and mainly fantastic al accounts of her nonexistent success she sends home. Eventually she\nreturns to the family home, containing only her sister\nnow, penniless.\nThis is the premise of the second in the Latchmere\nTheatre's season of plays by Michael Burrell. It\nconsists of two monologues, the first by Anthea, the\nyounger, and the second by Gwen, the elder. They\nare both played with considerable aplomb by AnnaBarry. Her task is not easy. The sisters are vastly\ndifferent, and these differences have to be brought\nout while still retaining the essential similarities of any\nsiblings. This she does. Gwen is a starchy meticulous\npseudo-middle class Tory voter, who tries not to be\nbitter that her self-sacrificing attitude has led to the\nslow demise of a promising career. Anthea is a distinctly lower-class slob, who doesn't let much\nworry her, -she, while not as grateful to her sister as\nshe should be, is basically happy.\nFunny in the watching, it is only once you have left\nthe theatre that the echoes of the futility of the human\ncondition hit you. Splendid stuff.\nVisit My Sister Next Door at the Latchmere Theatre,\n303 Battersea Park Road, SW11. Leap on a45 or a49 bus from South Kensington station, and you will\nbe transported to this theatre. The box office is on\n071-228 2620.\nAdam T. Opera.\nClarissa returns exhausted and begins half dreaming\na duet with Lovelace. But finally she rejects him, and\nin a fury Lovelace rapes her. In the aftermath of rape,\nClarissa seeks only death. Lovelace is banished and\ndefeated.\nThe premiere audience saw a lively performance\nwith a wonderful and remarkable Vivien Tierney in the\nrole of the heroine and a passionate Graeme\nMatheson-Bruce as Lovelace. They were multiplied by\nfive and four respectively by members of the dance\ntheatre company Second Stride who featured some\nballet ic elements. The music, which had Wagnerian,\nromantic and tonal qualities, was conducted by Oliver\nKnussen. At the end of a very respectable\nperformance the audience cheered eagerly. However,\nthere were also some rare and not surprising 'boos'.\nIf you wish to see contemporary and controversial\nopera, try this one. It is off the mainstream.\nLondon Coliseum, May 25 (tonight) 6, 29, June 1\nat 7.30pm. Cheapest tickets at \u00a32.50 from 10am on\nthe day of the performance.\nMichael H Wappelhorst.\n\n"

That was\nthe verdict of the debate held last Tuesday\non the motion 'This house believes that\nImperial College is a threat to liberal\neducation as fought for by Professor TH Huxley and should be razed to the\nground'. This was a similar motion to that\nproposed by Professor Huxley and his\nstudent HG Wells 100 years ago in the\nthen Royal College of Science.\nThe debate was chaired by Mr Eric\nStables, head of the Humanities\ndepartment and the motion was proposed\nby two ex-IC students, Nina Temple, the\npresent secretary of Britain's Communist\nParty, and Trevor Phillips, Editor-in Chief\nof London Weekend Television. It was\nopposed by Professor Brian Coles, ProRector of IC, and Neil McCluskey, IC\nUnion President.\nThe arguments called for a less\nspecialist form of teaching and pointed to\nthe large number of IC graduates who\nleave the country as proof that the college\nis a waste of national resources. They said\nthat a metaphorical razing to the ground\nof the college would mean a radical rethink\nof the institution's purpose.\nArguments against the proposal pointed\nto the respect that industry and government\nhas for the College. They said that any\nchanges that are needed ought to be made\nfrom inside IC and that liberal education\nwas a problem at the grass roots of British\nEducation.\nThe motion was passed by 30 votes to\n26. Michael Newman, an ex- IC student\nwho organised the debate, said afterwards\n'it went very well and I was very glad that\nthe motion was passed.'\nTaste of success\nImperial College Wine Tasting Society\nwon first prize in the 'University Wine\nChallenge 1990'.

Eng.\nPG), Paul Barford (Chem. Eng. PG),\nSteven Gargett (Physics UG), Kevin\nMcKoen (Physics PG) and Ian Speirs\n(Chem. Eng. UG). The competition was\nsponsored by Mercier an Wizard Wines.\nAll the teams complained that the event\nhad been arranged at short notice because\na sponsor had pulled out, and the Oxford\nteam said that 'the competition was biased\ntowards IC as only IC had tasted 'Wizard\nWines' before. They added that the\nproximity to exams had been a handicap,\nand had prevented them fielding some of\ntheir best tasters.\nThe Bath team commented that\nspi too ning was not very much in evidence,\nmost of the participants prefer ed to drink\nwhat they tasted.

    "content": "Film\nThe Witches\nWhat's bald, has purple eyes, a highly developed\nsense of smell and wears sensible shoes? Would you\nbelieve, a witch?\nSo we are led to believe by a cigar smoking granny\nrecounting her experiences to her grandson in The\nWitches, a new film by cult director Nicholas Roeg.\nThe film begins with Luke (Jasen Fisher-Steve\nMartin's deadpan son in Parenthood) and his\ngrandmother (Mai Zetterling) coming to England after\nthe death of Luke's parents. They decide to get away\nfrom it all and go on holiday to Torquay. As luck would\nhave it, the witch-busting granny and her witch-fearing grandson stumble upon an evil coven of\nwitches, led by the Grand High Witch (Angelica\nHuston). The witches are staying at the hotel as\nmembers of a convention of the RSPCC. This is an\ninteresting cover considering they detest children\n(they think children smell like dog shit) and they plan\nto turn them all into tiny mice. When Luke becomes\na 'guinea pig' for their potion the film kicks into gear.\nThis plot twist allows Jim Henson (he of Muppet\nfame), and his team from the Creature Shop to\nproduce some very neat prosthetic make-up for the\nwitches and very realistic duo of talking mice.\nThe story, adapted from na book by Roald Dahl,\ncomes across as a sinister childrens' fairly story made,\nprimarily, for a young audience. The film also has a fair quota of comic moments provided by Rowan\nAtkinson, who, as the hotel manager does a very close\nimpersonation of Basil Fawlty, minus the walk, and\nBill Paterson playing an OTT nouveau ric he businessman.\nAt times the acting degenerates into som thing resembling a Childrens Film Foundation effort and\nsome more scary effects, such as Angelica Huston\ntransforming into a crusty old witch, telescopic nose\nand all, are toned down to suit a younger audience.\nIf you can stand Willy Wonka and the Chocolate\nFactory then you are likely to find the film bearable,\nif only due to the comic touches and diminutive rodent\ndouble act.\nThe Witches opens on May 25.\nPete Collins.\nFilm\nAn Innocent Man\nTom Selleck plays an all American aircraft mechanic,\nwho is an all round good egg. Just imagine his surprise\nwhen one day after he's had a shower and is drying\nhis hair, two nasty policemen break into his house,\nmistake his hair dryer for a gun and shoot him. The\npolicemen check Tom's flat for drugs but of course\nfind none-then they realise there was some\nconfusion over their tip off and they have shot an\ninnocent man. Realising they might get their kun ck les rapped over this blunder they frame poor Tommy with\nsome dope and a gun. For those of you for whom the\nfilm was written, Tom is the good guy and the cops\nare the bad guys.\nNow we have the first dilemma for Tom; should he\nplead guilty to reduce his sent ance even though he\nis an innocent man? No, he says he's innocent and\nis banged up for six years. Things are tough inside:\nThe common stereotype of opera is overdressed,\nover endowed German women shrieking\nincomprehensibly. This is not entirely true. The English\nNational Opera (ENO) are presenting the ideal\nproduction to dispel this myth: an English translation\nof Mozart's le Nozze di Figaro' which is based on the\nplay by Beaumarchais.\nSet in the French provincial chateau of Count\nAlmaviva, four couples play dangerous games of love\nand deceit. The Count has a passion for his wife's maid, Susanna, who is the fiancee of his valet, Figaro.\nSusanna's cousin, Barbarina, is in love with the\nCountess' page Cherubino who is in turn in love with\nhis mistress. Also embroiled are Dr Bartolo and his\nhousekeeper Marcellina who believes that Figaro has\ncontracted to marry her in lieu of repayment of a debt.\nAll the action takes place on the day of Figaro and\nSusanna's marriage. As can be imagined, high farce\nrival gangs, dirty loos, uncomfortable beds, terrible\nfood-ah how it brings back memories of boarding\nschool. But Tom has a big problem, Jingles who baits\nand hits him. The second dilemma of Tom cometh\nforward: should he kill Jingles to gain respect or put\nup with him? After three years Tom is released,\nlooking remarkably similar to when he went in.\nNow the third dilemma of Tom looms up: should he\nget revenge on those bent cops? Revenge, good lord\nhow could our hero even consider it. Well don't worry\nfolks, to justify revenge and make a reasonably good\nending the writers have the cops pay Tom a visit and\nbe rather unpleasant. After a small shoot-out Tom\ncatches the nasty policemen and explains the plot to\nhis wife for those in the audience who are stupid or\nwere asleep. Suffice to say everyone lives happily ever\nafter.\nensues, with much hiding in closets and behind chairs,\njumping out of windows, overhearing others' secrets\nand the revealing of strawberry birthmarks. The\nconfusions are finally resolved in the garden at night\nwhen everybody is either hiding from each other or\npretending to be someone else.\nThis production is excellent. The cast have a strong\ngrip on the comic scenes and the farce is well timed.\nGregory Yurisich's Figaro was* disappointing. He\nseemed ill at ease with the role throughout most of\nthe middle acts. Lesley Garrett sang a pleasingly\neffervescent Susanna, while Valerie Masterson was\nsuperb as the spurned Countess. She was particularly\npowerful during the aria in which she laments the loss\nof her husband's love. Steven Page as the Count was\nworkmanlike, whilst Ethna Robinson as the page\nCherubino turned in a sparkling performance. The\nmain drawback was the chorus, who seemed\nThis film has a 'made for television' script peppered\nwith a few naughty words which do not make this a movie. To dismiss Tom as made for television is\nunfair, but after this performance one feels his best\nis yet to come. The film really isn'ta patch on Three\nMen and a Baby, I hope his next epic Quigley Down\nUnder will be better. The audience laughed a lot, but\nthere were not many jokes-they laughed at the film,\nat Tom in particular. Some of his facial expressions\nwere so unsuitable, one wonders how bad those on\nthe cutting room floor were.\nThe film is trivial but should please Selleck fans and\nall those who want to laugh at Selleck. I hope it is a success for Tom deserves good fortune after bravely\nquitting from Magnum.\nCharles Tomkins.\nOpera\nlacklustre and awkward when representing the local\nvillagers. The staging was, on the whole,\nconventional, with few risks taken in either costumes\nor set. However the lighting, by David Hersey, was\nof a far higher standard, both in the scenes where light\nappeared to stream through the chateau windows and\nin the difficult moonlit scene.\nThis is an admirable production sung in English\nwhich would be a suitable introduction to opera for\nthose who have never quite dared to take the plunge.\nIt is quite possible to follow the tortuous plot and the\nsinging gives a good approximation of Mozart's musical brilliance (even if hardened purists think it\nshould be sung in the original Italian).\nThe current ENO season continues until 2nd June.\nToby and Liz.\nThe Marriage of Figaro\n\n"

(It will probably refuse to print this page\nnow.)\nSabbatical life\nSabbaticals do not have a fixed number of hours in\ntheir work. You just have to work 'until the job is\ndone.' I am finding it more and more difficult to accept\nthis as I see Dave Williams and Fiona Nicholas working\n9 to 5 and then pissing off. I hope this year's sabbatical reports will contain some indication of how\nthe workload will be more evenly spread between the\nthree sabbaticals in the Union Office next year. At\npresent, the Honorary Secretary's Job Description\nleaves a great deal of scope for increasing the\nworkload. Maybe the work assigned to the post of\nConstitutional Policy Officer should be placed into the\nHon See's Job Description.

Her report to council, however,\nwas too much for me to overlook as FELIX Editor. Last\nyear's FELIX editor warned Fiona not to concentrate\ntoo greatly upon the social side of her job as Hon Sec\n(Events). I believe she has spent a large part of her\ntime concentrating, and relaxing, on just this aspect.\nIt is easy to complain that sabbaticals have a right to\na private life, but I cannot accept this argument when\nit impinges upon their job.\nOne of Fiona's most annoying sides this year is her\nthreats to resign as soon as her judgment is\nquestioned. The last meeting of the Union's council\nsaw her making a resigning point of a very petty issue\nconcerning elections. I can see her telling me that I should no-confidence her at UGM if I have these\ncriticisms, but that is not the answer. Where are the\nbar promotions, organised by the Hon-Sec and the\nUnion Bar Manager, which we saw last year? Why\nwasn't Fiona at the first barbeque organised by the\nUnion last week-it was a social event, supposedly?\nAll this has come far too late in the year to make much\ndifference. I hope Murray Williamson will bear it mind\nfor next year, however. I'm sorry Fiona; I'm sure you\nhate doing your job as much as I hate doing mine, but\nmy job is to let people know of this.\nPeople may complain that I have not attacked Neil\nMcCluskey. He was the sabbatical working in the\nUnion Office for most of the Easter vacation, for\nwhich he has my praise, not criticism.\nFELIX is published by the editor for and on be ha if of Imperial College Union\nPublications Board and is printed by the Imperial College Union Print Unit,\nPrince Consort Road, London, SW7 2BB( Tel. 071-589 5111 ext 3515).\nEditor: Dave Smedley.

    "content": "A study at St Mary's Hospital Medical School showed\nthat poor results in previous examinations not only\ncaused increased anxiety levels, but also the adoption\nof surface learning techniques-the strategy\nassociated with poor examination performance.\nSo stress can directly affect your exam\nperformance, by inducing you to work in an ineffective\nmanner. The bad results this produces result in higher\nstress levels in the following examinations and the\nproblem worsens. Awareness of the stress you are\nunder and a knowledge of the effects it can have\nshould enable you to cope with the situation and avoid\nadopting bad learning techniques.\nThe best ways of controlling the harmful effects of\nstress are to eat properly, exercise and possibly utilise\none of the many relaxation techniques, such as yoga,\nTai Chi, aromatherapy and meditation.\nExercise has several useful effects. Firstly, if you\nexercise regularly you will build up your fitness, and\nyour body will look healthy. The improvements in your\nappearance will give you feelings of self-esteem,\nwhich in turn helps you to deal with problems\neffectively. Exercise also keeps your circulatory\nsystem working well, so that you have lower blood\npressure and higher adrenal in levels. The adrenal in keeps you alert, and aids concentration. Exercise also\nproduces higher levels of Endomorphins-morphine like substances which make you feel good, and reduce\ndepression.\nBe careful, however; you should build your fitness\nslowly. Regular exercise will reduce the tension\ncaused by stress, allowing you to 'let off steam' and\nwill also encourage deep, refreshing sleep.\nA healthy diet is also essential. The table shows you\nthe major food groups, and how often you should eat\nthem. Apart from maintaining a balanced diet you\nshould cut down on coffee, tea, salt, sugar and animal\nfats. Appetite is linked to anxiety. Increased anxiety\ncan increase or reduce your appetite, or cause an\nirregular appetite. None of these will help you to deal\nwith stress. Watch what you eat and eat regularly.\nWhen we become stressed we are also inclined to\nsmoke and drink more. This is not good, as although\nboth will make you feel better for a short while, they\nwill not solve the problem, and can tend to magnify\nit by the changes in mood they can cause (or by the\ntime lost due to a drinking bout, that leaves you\nhungover for a week ll. There are two simple rules by which you can control\nstress levels so that it does not affect your work or\nsocial life to any great extent:\n1. Be aware of the cause, and make sure you continue\nto deal with it in an effective manner.\n2. Keep your body healthy, and able to deal with the\nstress, by eating properly, and exercising regularly.\nIt has been shown that the student under the greatest\namount of stress are University students. This stress\nis even greater at universities falling into just one of\nthe following categories:\n1. Those in the centre of large cities.\n2. Those containing an uneven male to female ratio.\n3. Those situated in 'expensive living cost' areas.\n4. Those with high academic entrance requirements.\n5. Those specialising in medicine, veterinary medicine,\nscience or engineering.\nEvery one of these categories applies to Imperial\nCollege. Most of us are under a great deal of stress\nwhether we realise it or not!\nSigns of Stress Food to combat stress\n\u2022 Do you feel guilty when relaxing-uneasy if GROUP FREQUENCY\nnot 'on the go'?\n\u2022 Do you lie awake worrying about tomorrow?
