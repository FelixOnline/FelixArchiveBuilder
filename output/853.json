All\ntheir short corners were blocked well by Diana Hill and\nJane Bunch, and an excellent penalty flick save by\nAlison Franklin denied them the lead, until a scrap in\nthe 'D' allowed them to tap the ball in to make it 1 -0\nto Bristol.\nIn the half-time interval, coach Syd motivated the\ntired and sweated bodies, and some good\nperseverance from flu-ridden Diana and Oana Carlin\nwith a cut knee allowed us to start the second half.\nSome excellent wobbling by Jackie Scott came to\nnothing as our attack came into contact with their star\n1st XI player at the back.\nBristol's three fresh pairs of legs were too much for\nour defence and not even Hazel King and Anna Gray\nwith their decisive tackling could keep them from\nscoring a second goal. We were unlucky up front not\nto have got more decisions our way as the umpire was\noutrageously crap! He did redeem himself though, by\nawarding us a short-corner, but it was sadly\nsquandered.\nA good all-round team performance shocked their\nteam and coach into thinking that IC ladies now have\na team to be reckoned with.

    "content": "Carl Kent-Smith and Susan Appleby interviewed the Prims in November. Stick with them, says Car\ngot even more to give us in the 90's. Interview\u2014The Primitives\nThe coldest day I can remember since the hot summer\nerased my cold day memory cells. Inside the Town\n& Country Club it's nearly as cold, with a harsh sound\ncheck doing little to warm the atmosphere. Our wit\nis tempered by a debate into everything; sex, drugs\nand the Prims worth. I feel like a minority amongst my\ncompany, still starry eyed about the whole thing,\nexcited, overawed and wanting to be here. Wanting\nto be cool, but faced with meeting and talking to a band I 've admired for so long. You could say I was\na little nervous. Would they be difficult, doing the big\nstart thing? I was desperate not to be disappointed,\nand....I wasn't.T= Tracy (vocals)\nP= Paul (guitar, vocals)\nA= Andy (bass)\nDo you all still live in Coventry?\nT: Paul and I do, and Tig, the drummer also, but\nAndy's still in Sheffield.\nWhat's the nucleus of the Prims, these days, who\nare the original members?\nP: Well, there was Pete Tweeder, he plays drums in\nthe band third on the bill tonight, See See Rider.\nStever, Stever Dulahugn, he's doing various things\naround the Midlands. He's working with a guy called\nMartin Baker.\nAfter Crush, and you got a lot of exposure on Top\nof the Pops, was it worse then?\nT: Yeah, there was a bit more then, with posters\nplastered around every corner, on every street, so\npeople were quite aware of us...they'd stop and stare\nand stuff.\nAre you still getting lots of comments about your\nhair, you must be pretty sick of it by now?\nT: It's a bit of a pain in the arse really.\nSo what were you up to between Lovely and Sick\nof it All coming out?\nP: We did loads of tours abroad. We did go to America\nfor two weeks, but we did mostly Europe. We were\nrecording the album over that period of time, when\nwe weren't in the public eye or whatever. It wasn't like a solid recording session, but a week here and a week there. That's the way we work, we don't like\ndoing it all the time.\nThe second album wasn't difficult to produce in\nany way?\nP: Not really. We had a lot more say in it, and we knew\nwhat we wanted when we went and started it.\nT: We had a more relaxed atmosphere as well. Just\nthe producer and the band, and we weren't being\ninterfered with by other people.\nWhat was it like pulling all the material together?\nThe first album seemed more like you had\neverything ready, a collection of singles and the\nB sides. Pure seems a bit different, did you write\nit in one go, or while you were in the studio...?\nP: No, we never write songs in the studio, that's when\nyou're desperate. They just happened as they always\nhave done, sometimes two songs in a week. It just\nall came together.\nPaul, you seem to do most of the writing, do you\nwrite the lyrics as well?\nP: Yeah, I just sit down with a guitar at home and write\na song, and give the rest of the band a cassette. But\nthe actual finished product is like a band effort,\neveryone puts input into it.\nI 've noticed that Pure seems a lot deeper subject-wise and in the song structures. Are we ever\ngoing to see a return to the good time thrash stuff\nof Stop Killing Me and Really Stupid?\nT: We want to get away from that 2 minute sickly sort\nof pop song.\nP: We probably like bits of that still, but we want to\nbury that a bit now. Although Stop Killing Me is alright.\nSpacehead, you're not too keen on that I gather?\nP: Yeah, the newer stuff, we wanna kick all the sugar\nout basically.\nIs this going to be your approach to the 90's? A lot of people would say that you're rooted in the\n80s, specifically all the bands that came out in\n1986.\nT:I think we're constantly changing really. Most of\nthe new material isn't commercial, but then again it\ncould be. We're just sort of moving on really.\nAre you not ever forced to take a more\ncommercial part? Possibly if the singles aren't doing so well, do you not get outside suggestions,\nespecially major label suggestions?\nT: In the beginning yes. Obviously with the success\nof Crash they thought that everything else would\nfollow like that. But there's so much variety within\nthe Primitives that it just didn't happen. They're more\naware now that they might get a single that does\nreally well, and the next one might not.'\nSo, do you think you've got the stamina and the\nnecessary longevity to go on for a few years, and\ncarry on right into the 90s.P: We're not struggling at the moment. We've got\nloads of new songs happening and things.\nHow do you feel about the way the music press\nis treating you at the moment? Ever since you\nmade it into the charts they've completely turned\nagainst you.\nP: Well, not completely, but we've always had our\nenemies and suffered backlashes all along the line\nWhat bands are you listening to at the moment,\nI would've though they'd be slightly different to\nwhat you listened to before you recorded Lovely?\nAre these band influences?\nP: Not really. We're not really influenced by anyone\nthese days. You listen to stuff, but when you start\nout you tend to copy bands more because you're\nfinding your feet. But the stuff we listen to doesn't really influence us anymore.\nWhat about for your own enjoyment, what do you\nlisten to at home?\nT:A lot of old stuff really. I still listen to T Rex,\nTeardrop Explodes, it's really varied. I like some acid\nhouse music as well.\nAll your record sleeves, and most of the Lazy\nreleases have a pretty definite image, and you can\nalways identify them as Prims releases. The\ndesigners. Flat Earth, who are they?\nP:I think Wayne, our manager, found the guy who\nis Flat Earth.\nT: He's been with us from the beginning really. We\nsort of work with him to get what we want.\nWas the transition from indie label to major pretty\nseamless, or did you encounter any problems?\nP: there was a lot of confusion at the start really. A lot of people trying to have their say in things. It see on got sorted out though.\nDid it hold up what you wanted to do at any stage?\nP: Not really, no.\nDrugs seem to be portrayed as fairly trendy in the\nmedia at the moment, and I noticed that in\nMelody Maker it seemed to suggest you were out\nof your heads on ec stacy in the last video...\nT: Was it true?\nP: Yes, I'm afraid so.\nT: Tut, tut, smack our wrists.\nDid you ever expect to be this successful?\nP: Not really. Not at the start. Everything went up in\nlittle steps. TOTP and all that lot was just like the next\nstep. When it got to that point.\nT: We've got a lot of determination and a lot of new\nstuff and we're happy and we're going to carry on into\nthe 90s. What about future plans, is it going to be another\nlong wait until we see you play again?\nP: We want to record an EP in January. If we do do\nthat, then we'l do like a really quick tour of the UK.\nIt'll be like small clubs, just a really buzz y kind of tour.\nT; Intimate little holes.\nP: No, no (laughs).\nAre the Primitives sexy?\nT: Yes. Would you say we were (to Paul)\nFairly erotic\nT: Everybody's sexy aren't they? If you're a band I think you can be extra sexy.\nHow do you make yourselves extra sexy then?\nT: It's hard to say really.\nA: I wear black stockings.\nWhat, all the time?\nA: Well, yeah.\nP:I don't wear anything when I'm in the bath.\nHave you done your Christmas shopping yet?\nT: No. No, we're not going to have time to either, 'cos\nnext weekend we go to Spain and then we go to\nAmerica for a couple of weeks, so we won't really\nhave time.\nWell, with no more burning questions to ask,\nthanks also for the interview. Hope the gig's good\ntonight.\nT&P; Thankyou.\nPage 11\n\n"

    "content": "IC Union President 'hacked off with student apathy\nEducational suicide\nStudents will be deterred from taking up higher\neducation if the Governments Student Loans proposal\ngoes through, according to a survey published by the\nNational Union of Students (NUS) this week. Ms\nMaeve Sherlock, NUS president, pointed out that the\nscheme was unpopular and would be no cheaper to\nthe Treasury than the present grant system.\nThe report claims that 24% of pupils with semiskilled parents would drop their plans for higher\neducation if the loans were introduced, compared with\nan overall average of 16% for all 18 year olds. 5.5%\nof students with semi-skilled parents said that their\nparents could finance a college education, compared\nwith 22% of the professional groups.\nThe NUS stressed that these results indicate that\nthe Government's scheme would have a strongly\ndeterrent effect on higher education, and a marked\nclass bias. Ms Diana Warwick, general secretary of\nthe Association of University Teachers, commented\nthat the loans scheme would be 'making universities\nmore middle class than they already are.' Statistics\nshow that despite that 56% of 18 year olds come from\nmanual or semi-skilled backgrounds only 18% of\nhigher education students come from the same group.\nThe boycotting of banks involved in the loans\nproposal is going ahead, with the full approval of the\nNUS. Already 100 students from Loughborough have\ntransferred their accounts to LLoyds bank, who are\nnot involved in the scheme. In addition, thousands\nof students have written to the colluding banks to warn\nthem that they will withdraw their accounts if the\nbanks continue to co- operate with the government\nin the matter.\nQualifications\nquestioned\nAnxiety in the City and Guilds reached new heights\nthis week after the City and Guild London Institute\n(C& GLI) announced its intention to award the letters\n'ACGI' (Associate of the City and Guilds Institute)\nto students not of Imperial College.\nAt the moment only those students who are taking\nCity and Guilds courses in I.C. are eligible to have\nthese letters on graduation, which is comparable to\nthe letters 'ARCS' (Associate of the Royal College\nof Science) for those student graduating in courses\nin the Royal College of Science. Students fear that\nthe uniqueness and value of the qualification will be\nlost.\nProfessor Patrick Holmes, Dean of the City and\nGuilds at I.C. expressed worries that there would be\nno way of knowing if the value of the qualification\nwas the same through the different routes that non-I.C. students would take. He cited the recent report\nin which I.C.'s Engineering Department was voted\nthe best in Europe, and graduates from this department\nwould apparently have the same qualification as\nstudents from elsewhere if the C& GLI's proposals\ngo through.\nHe finished by saying 'Of course, there is\nconsiderable concern'.\nThe Union General Meeting (UGM) held in the\nJunior Common Room last Thursday debated a number of motions a pertaining to student loans. Mr Neil McCluskey I.C. Union president proposed a motion that IC Union should support the governments\nproposals on student loans and also their proposals\nto remove students from the welfare benefit system\nas from this September. He explained that the motion\nwas put forward because he was 'totally hacked-off\nwith the apathy of I.C. students. The motion was\noverwhelmingly defeated, with the consensus of\nopinion that the point had been taken.\nA further motion was passed asking the National\nWestminster bank to remove their name from their\ndeclaration of co-operation with the loans proposal.\nIt also asked the ICU president to implement a scheme\nto facilitate the switching of bank accounts to another\nThe Physics Department at Imperial College has been\nunder attack in a report in the 'Times Higher\nEducation Supplement' as too unproductive in relation\nto its size. The paper claims that a recent report by\nthe Science Policy Research Unit (SPRU) shows that\nbigger departments do not necessarily produce more\nresults, and the IC Physics Department is the biggest\nin the country.\nThe report claims that the size of the department\nis no index of its productivity, though the SPRU\nadmits that they as esse d 'productivity' only as the\nnumber of research papers published by members of\nthat department, and is not concerned with teaching\nor any other factors.\nProfessor J.B. Pendry, Associate head of the\nPhysics Department, countered by saying T disagree\nwith it of course ... it's quality that counts; our claim\nto being a good department is not that we are the\nlargest.... its the quality of people we have'. He\nstressed that though it was important to write papers,\nthe report probably did not weight papers according\nto their importance. He claimed that his department\nwas amongst the best; 'Our productivity is high. -we dont need to be the highest'. He added that Oxford\nUniversity's Physics Department was the largest in\nthe country, not Imperial College's, and that his\ndepartment has both experimental and theoretical\nphysicists. Theorists tend to publish more papers -bank, to inform the college authorities of their\nopposition and to remove all signs with the word\n'NatWest' on them from the campus.\nA late motion was passed enabling the Publications\nBoard chairman, Mr Doug King, to 'look into' the\nfunding of a scheme whereby stickers with the logo\n'GnatWest - No Money? No Job? Then Fuck off,\ncreated by the comic 'Viz', could be used to cover\nup the NatWest advertisement on the back of IC Union\ncards.\nThe loans will be phased in from next September,\nand will eventually make up half the maintenance\ngrant. The second reading of the Student loans bill\ntook place last Tuesday. The government has used\na one line clause to enable the implementation of the\nloans, so it is unlikely that it will be amended in any\nway.\nbut this does not mean that they are more 'productive'.\nDr B.L. Morgan, Associate director of planning\ncommented that SPR U figures are always\ncontroversial, and that their aspersions were 'not true\non a number of levels'. He cited the Sunday Times\nemployer's poll in which IC Physics Department,\ncame out as being popular with employers looking\nfor graduates.\nHealing old\nwounds\nDr \u2022 Charles Phelps, Pro-rector of International\nRelations at Imperial College, was one of a number\nof representatives from the first British business\nmission to Argentina for seven years.\nThe mission was arranged by the 'Latin American\nTrade Advisory Group' under the auspices of the\nDepartment of Trade and Industry and the Foreign\nOffice. It was completed earlier this month and it is\nhoped that trade links between the two countries will\nbecome stronger.\nPage 3\nPhysics department slurred\n\n"

It was\nsent to us with some very interesting contents. The\ncassette tape left in the machine contained\nconfidential details of a bar-brawl in late October. The\ntape goes on to name the offenders and\nrecommendations for their punishment. Being an\nupstanding organ, FELIX will not print any of the\ndetails contained thereon. Furthermore, we have\nreturned the tape to its supplier, Mr Dave Williams.\nMost frightening of all was the B side of the\ncassette-this had last year's Hon Sec, Ian Morris\nsinging a collection g of songs from his latest album!\n\u2022 Time to reveal the vodka scam. Seasoned drinkers\nhave been rushed into Southside in recent weeks to\nsample a promotion of Poznozce. This column can\nnow reveal that all the glasses used were left sitting\non a tray of vodka to give a slight flavour of vodka.\nWhy? Because Poznozce is the same stuff that the\nGovernment has been trying to flog you-London Tap,\nwith a hint of filtered Tobasco sauce for the burn. The\ncunning plan, at 50p per shot, is estimated to have\nraised \u00a380 for Rag.\n\u2022 How long will Linstead Warden Jan Bradley last?\nRumous are flying around that Ms Bradley will be\nresigning from her post in the very near future. A case\nof did she jump or was she pushed.\n\u2022 Union Academic Affairs Officer, Athos Ritzbiscuit\nis said to be deep in the sticky brown stuff following\nthe issue of FELIX a fortnight ago. A letter written by\nthe Christian Union was apparently signed by ten of\nits members. It now transpires that nine of the\nsignatures were false. So crafty was Mr Ritzbiscuit\nin the letter, that he signed himself halfway through\nthe list of names. The hapless AAO is being reminded\nthat he has broken the eleventh commandment-'Thou shalt not forge other people's names and then\ntell pork ies about it'. Beware of any low-flying\nthunderbolts, folks.\nPage 12\n\u2022 Last year's Editor Bill Goodwin, has been involved\nin some heavy legal wrangling at the high court lately.\nMr Goodwin, answering a charge of contempt of court\nfor his part in the leaking of sensitive company\ninformation, is lucky to have such a loyal bunch of\nfriends. So concerned about Bill's well-being are they,\nthat a sweepstake has been organised in the FELIX Office. The pot currently stands at \u00a340, most of\nwhich came from present staff. So far, the Guilds\nOffice have been the cruelest, hoping Bill gets sent\ndown for 2 years or more.'\n\u2022 The Union Internal Services Officer was\npropositioned recently. Walking home to his\nfashionable Archway flat, Christ Stapleton (for it is\nhe) was stopped by a handsome young gentleman.\nSeeing Chris's leather clad body, the youth stated,\n'Excuse me, I find you very attractive, can I come\nhome with you?' Mr Stapleton's reply has not been\nrecorded but he was sighted running at top speed\nthrough Highgate Cemetery.\n\u2022 A complaint was made to Union Deputy President,\nDave Williams, by self-made woman Nicky Fox on a matter of security. La Fox complained about the lack\n(i.e. none) of rape alarms in the ladies changing rooms.\nIt is three weeks since Mr Williams was approached,\nbut so far nothing has been done. Doubtless Mr\nWilliams is considering the matter with his usual\nefficiency.\n\u2022 Scandal reaches my ears of one Bharterdu Vyas. He\nresigned from India Society when they wouldn't elect\nhim as Chairman and formed Asian Society. Despite\nprotestations from his previous club, due to an overlap\nin membership, Asian Society is now thriving with\nsome 150 members. It is a pity that the same can't be said for the club's finances. Asian Soc's first event\nof the year involved hiring a band for \u00a3300 and\nhanding out a large number of free tickets. Asian\nSociety is now in debt to the tune of...\u00a3300.\n\u2022 My good friend Peter Leeson, Superintendent of\nEvelyn Gardens has been mentioned lately. Mr Leeson\nhas been under mounting pressure to leave from the\nGardens wardens. Now I hear he may be involved in\nthe maintenance services forthcoming Easter\nreshuffle.\n\u2022 Beit Quad was evacuated on Wednesday when a fire alarm refused to be silenced. Despite hunting high\nand low, both Deputy President Dave Williams and the\nextremely competent body of College security,\ncouldn't locate the switch to disable the alarm. The\ncontrol panel was eventually found, hidden under the\nbags and coats of the ladies football team. Nice to\nknow that if a real fire breaks out, we'll all be in safe\nhands.\n\n"

    "content": "Every bloody year it's the same, a time to dread as the family reappears.\nWhy I hate Christmas\nChristmas is a time when we rejoice in the birth of\nlittle baby Jesus and exchange gifts in memory of this\ngreat event, or so we are told. I say rubbish!\nChristmas is a time when we all try our damnedest\nto get as drunk as possible in an attempt to ignore the\nwhole sordid affair.\nWhat makes the whole thing so unbearable? Old\npeople, that's what. Every year they traps e round in\nthose shoes that 'will last them out,' and those\ndentures which will clatter throughout Christmas\ndinner. Even before the great day they will waddle in\nfront of you down Oxford Street, like some\namorphous je i ly, intent on buying their bath salts and\nsocks before you get there. And why are you slaving\nthrough the cold in the first place? To buy their bloody\npen and paper set (again). It should be added at this\npoint that the one good thing about old people is that\nthey always forget what you have bought them\npreviously. My grandmother usually forgets by the\nQueen's Message.\nThis leads on to the great day itself. Having reached\na suitably inebriated state, it is usual to be greeted by\nan old person's kiss. It is a little known fact that\ngrandparents take 60 years or more to perfect the wet\nkipper effect required, and you really shouldn't be too\nungrateful for this gesture of goodwill. Instead you\nshould casually stroll to the bathroom at a suitable\nopportunity, or attempt to persuade the dog to lick\nthe offending area, the dog, after all, has more sense\nof etiquette and a full set of teeth. Do not, however,\nexpect the worst to be over. Dinner is only around the\ncorner.\nThis raises a lot of unanswered questions. Do you\nattempt to get the grandparents drunk at this stage?\nThere are dangers in both directions. If you slip them\nan extra sherry they will probably babble on for hours\nabout the cost of bread, oranges in stockings and how\nthe winters were always much colder. If you don't, they will babble on for hours about how nice it was\nto see Charlie and Fergie back together again and how\nthe Sun says it won't last. Either way, you cannot\nwin. The only sound advice is if in doubt, get them\nplastered. A granny in the armchair is worth two in\nfull vent.\nNow we reach that tenuous subject of hot air. It is\na well known fact that Brussell sprouts are an\nessential part of Christmas dinner. It is a very sad fact,\ntherefore, that they are packed full of pump worthy\nvictuals. Yes, one mouth-full and the Grandparents\nwill probably be able to accompany the National\nAnthem at the end of the Queen's Message. The\nanswer to this problem is simple. Old people always\nhave badly fitting dentures. They spend long evenings\ngrinding away at them ready for this great day, to give\nthe most ill-fitting effect. The end result of their\nendeavours is invariably a sound akin to the machine\nwhich steam cleans the tracks on the underground.\nThey do this to annoy you. They know this will be the\nlast time you invite them round for a long while and\nthey want to make the most of it. The ploy is double-edged, however. Few people know that old people\nCANNOT EAT NUTS OR ANYTHING WITH SEEDS IN.\nThey get under their plate. To avoid the\naforementioned sprout problem, simply sprinkle nuts\nonto the offending items on their plate. This should\nwork. It carries the danger of THE WORST THING\nTHAT CAN HAPPEN AT CHRISTMAS DINNER,\nhowever.\nPage 16\nThe worst thing that can happen at Christmas\ndinner, is that an old person discovers a seed or piece\nof nut under the denture plate. They will initially\nsquirm, as you can look on in g lea, and raise the\ndenture sound level by a few dec ib les. If this does not\nwork, you should leave the table instantly. If you do\nnot you will be treated to the sight of granny getting\nher dentures out. With a sound like the birth of a small\nwhale from a common field mouse a lump of pink and\nwhite matter will emerge, dripping saliva everywhere.\nAny hopes of saving the rest of the turkey for Boxing\nDay will drift away forever.\nNow is your chance to rush away from the table,\nraid the drinks cabinet and look back at what you have\nreceived this year. Amongst the bottles of Brut and\nOld Spice for the blok es and Marks and Spencers Gift\nSets/Cheap Boots Perfume (especially Charlie) for the\nwomen, there lie the endless streams of socks and\nhandkerchiefs. However much you stress to people\nthat you do not need any more of these offending\narticles, they still find their way in. Very few people\nknow that once you go beyond the age of 60 you lose\nthe ability to purchase anything other than socks, ties,\nhandkerchiefs and of course gift tokens. Old people\nonly live next to crap shops. That is why they always\nsend record vouchers for WH Smiths and\nWoolworths, and gift tokens for Marks and Spencers\n(because they sell socks and....) If your Grandparents\ncould make the trip, they would probably get vouchers\nfor the Mother Gradenski's Polish reject shop in\nGdansk, just for the sheer inconvenience.\nTry it, it's true. Work in a shop over Christmas and\nsee if you can refuse to sell an old person a pair of\nsocks. Soon you will find yourself approaching the old\ndears and asking 'What size socks would madam like\nto purchase?' This is why socks come in such large\nsize ranges. When granny can hardly remember what\nday it is, she hardly has much hope of remembering\nyour shoe size, does she? One last point. Old people,\nif at all possible, will always go for the terry socks,\nwhich you have avoided and grown out of so long ago.\n('But they're very warm and sensible, deary.')\nThe only hope you have of salvation is to cancel the\nwhole event. This is actually very easy. When you go\nto collect the grandparents say something like 'What\na lovely speech the Queen made this year, and what\na nice pair of socks you bought me.' With their\ninherent bad memory, they will instantly assume they\nhave forgotten the whole day. If this fails, say, 'And\ndidn't you drink a lot this year? We had to carry you\nhome.' As they gaze forlornly at their offerings of\nsocks and handkerchiefs, simply add 'and you haven't even opened your presents yet,' and hastily rip the\ngift tags off. No more will your Christmas be one of\ngeriatric doom. Go home and get drunk and enjoy\nyourself instead.\n\n"

We fought back\nwell with several chances but it was Mark who finally\nbroke through with a good run, out pacing the\nunmarked police car behind him, and lobbing the ball\n30ft in the air, just over the Bart's keeper, to make\nit 1-1.\nThe second half started with the switching of\npeople to their more natural roles-Steve Burton to\ncentre-forward and Dave Millard to umpire! We fought\nwell and, despite a goal from Dom Howard being\ndisallowed and Andrew Talby having a case of PE only\nto find he'd hit the post, we couldn't break through.\nAnd nor could Barts as the 7 short corners in a row,\ngiven to them by umpire Dave were wasted.\nA11 draw was a good result for IC 2nds and IC\n1 sts who will have to play them for the UL title at the\nend of the season.\nSailing\nA quick summary of the last few results:\nThe conditions at Queen Mary Reservoir were\nalmost ideal for IC's match against Kent, the team put\nin a strong performance, beating the mediocre team\n4-nil.\nA trip to Cardiff at the end of November saw the\nfledgling second team in (unsuccessful) action again,\nbut the first team managed .to pull off a fine win\nagainst Bristol ladies, though Cardiff University proved\ntoo strong for us.\nThe beginning of December found the team stopped\nby the police less than a hundred yards of their journey\nto Southampton, which spurred them on to a21 win\nover the University of London team, followed by an\nex hi le rating match against Southampton, in which IC\ndeserved to do better than their 2-0 loss.\nFootball\nIC II-I2) 2 RFH-(O)1 IC 2nds bounced back to winning ways after having\nlost their two previous games. A determined first half\nperformance was rewarded with goals from N Leonard\nand A Anwar, who was making his return from injury.\nIC could have gone in with a goal or two more, but\nshots from J Fordham and at hund rous effort from E Coates were well saved.\nIC found themselves under more pressure after the\ninterval, but soaked it up well and still managed\nseveral efforts at the opponents goal, the most\nnotable being an overhead kick from R Martinez, who\nPage 26\nshowed all the agility of a very agile thing to create\nthe chance.\nIncidentally, Royal Free Hospital scored midway\nthrough the second half from their only clear cut\nattempt at goal.\nCross\nCountry\nThe latest adventure for the intrepid members of the\nCross-Country Club took place on the all too familiar,\nbattle scared Parliament Hill. This time it was under\nthe auspices of the University of London with the IC\nteam determined to show that they were true Harriers\nand carry off the team prize. All the stalwarts of the\nLondon Colleges League were entered and there was\nlittle to fear. It was widely hoped that the fresh faced\nAlex Gaskill would follow up several striking efforts\nby flying into the top three but he crash-landed to 6th with the out stan id ng Paul Northrop taking the\nindividual first prize with another savage\ndemonstration of pain acceptance. David Ngugi loped\nthrough to 8th place in a typical fashion and Stefan\nLedu made his way to 11th, Lol stormed to 12th and\nJimmy rounded out the team in 19th position. Perhaps\nthe most surprising performance was the placing of\nSteve Berry in 29th; what an athlete. IC thus rescued\ntheir ULU team title and would also have had a2nd place if a better attendance had completed the 2nd team. With the next race after Christmas there is\nplenty of time for the injury interrupted careers to be\nrestarted and for the strict dominance of the London\nscene to continue.\nTable\ntennis\nThree events to report on this term:\n1. In the IC Closed Table Tennis Championships, Ng\nKeng beat Kjell Rosvoll 21-10, 21-16 in the final; Ian\nMatthews and Francois Decobert were the beaten\nsemi-finalists. An exhibition match was played\nbetween Mohammed Uneeb and an England\nInternational player before this event which resulted\nin a11 draw.\n2. Mohammed Uneeb distinguished himself and the\nclub by coming third in the UAU individual\nchampionships held in Manchester 25-26 November.\nHe narrowly lost his semi-final to a loughborough\ncompetitor 21-18, 22-20, after winning seven other\nmatches to reach this stage.\nThe total entry was 150 players, including several\nEngland ranked players.\n3.

    "content": "Various\nElectronic and\nNew music\nSome Music is Private Music is a sampler of 'new\nmusic'. It is not exactly New Age, (i.e. random\narpeggios and birdsong) but sophisticated ethereal\nbackground mu zak for the frustrated thirty\nsomethings and young fogeys who have outgrown the\nvenerable (or should that be venereal) rockers\ncurrently feathering their retirement nests in\nAmerica's stadia. FM rock it isn't but with the\nexception of Shankar's psychedelic curry house music\nParambh, the 13 pieces have sufficient similarity to\nmake this a pleasurable 70 minutes.\nTangerine Dream, Andy Summers and Eddie Jobson\nprovide mainstream credibility and their contributions\nare much as one would expect, although Summers the\nsoloist lacks the inventiveness of his Police days.\nElsewhere, sax symbols Michael Brecker and David\nSanborn guest on Michael Colina's Joy Dancing.\nAs a sampler it is cheap and good value and\nalthough little here will make you rush out and buy\nthe entire back catalogue of this label it is still a cut\nabove the techno pap that Jean Michel Jarre churns\nout. It also works much better than the new sampler\nby Virgin Music's Venture label, Music Without\nFrontiers Vol 2.\nAgain long and exceptionally low price (the artists\napparently donated songs and waived royalties to\nkeep the cost down), it is such a diverse mixture of\nstyles that it is difficult to listen to in a single sitting.\nJazzy fusion, Adult Orientated Chanteuses (this\nmeans that they are trying to be sophisticated, not\nthat there are nude photos of them or that they sing\nabout sex) tend to clash with the more avant garde\nmusical pieces by such composers as Michael Nyman\nand Ennio Morricone.\nOne of the principal problems of this compilation is\nthat the standard is not as high as included on the first\nsampler. Few of the tracks are good enough to make\nyou want to listen to the whole on their strengths\nalone. Contributions by Mike Gibbs and Itchy Fingers\nare pleasant enough but there is no natural flow\nthrough into the downright strange Llano by Cassell\nWebb. Of the middle seven tracks only the ambient\nSnow by Electric Circus stands out but the final side\npicks up with New Age folk by Michael O 'Suilleabhain\nand the peice s by Nyman and Morricone showing the\ndifference between serious composition and\nexperiment.\nIt would be nice to recommend this but in all\nhonesty Music Without Frontiers 1 or Private Music\nare better samplers. A for effort but only C for\nattainment.\nCDL.\nPage 10\nVarious\nSingles\nApparently the script for Roadhouse required a Blues\nband with a blind guitarist. In the wildly eclectic world\nof Rock 'n' Roll these are not exactly ten a penny. You\ncan get fat black, Mississippi bluesmen called King in\ntwelve packs from any record emporium but young\nwhite Canadian guitarists deficient in the sight area\nare a rare commodity, this year at least. This leads\nme to believe that Jeff Healey's uncle or some other\nclose relation wrote the script for Roadhouse.\nWhen the Night Comes Falling from the Sky is a Bob\nDylan song covered by the Jeff Healey Group for the\nfilm. It is a cut above standard twelve bar Blues. Tight\nand full of balls it has more energy than Dylan's shuffling original and Healey treats us to some wicked\nsixth string tickling. This should keep Healey's fans\ncontent until he records the follow up to See the Light,\nwhich has now gone double platinum in his native land\n(probably 250 copies sold).\nIn a completely different groove (good Rockspeak\nthere), Sydney Youngblood has a new 12\" out, (not\nhis wanger) called Sit and Wait. Were I in the disco\nlooking to pull; dressed in my white suit with my chest\nwig neatly stuck on and my medallion gleaming, I would probably do exactly what the title says until\nScratch 'n' Sniff Megamixer Pete Waterman put on\nsome decent music. I'd rather squeeze my blackheads\nthan dance to this mindless tosh. Bobby Brown must\nbe laughing his cock off if this is the best that the\nopposition can come up with.\nCDL.\nRush\nPresto\nFor years Rush have been something of an enigma.\nLargely ignored by the popular media (TV & Radio)\nthey have been happy to ignore the attentions of\nmusic journalists after countless misquotes and poor\npress. Despite this they have endeared themselves to\na large part of our generation and retained the staunch\nsupport of this audience whilst growing from science\nfiction and mythological hippies into elder statesmen\nof adult orientated rock. They have been called the\nworld's biggest underground band partly because of\ntheir refusal, or inability to tailor their music to the\nsingles market.\nPresto is their thirteenth studio LP in 15 years and\nmarks no great departure from their style of late.\nKeyboards are used less as a focus and more as a backdrop to the guitar-bass-drums arrangements but\nthey are still evident throughout. Neil Peart's writing\ntheme seems to be deception and hidden things be\nthey magical as in the title track, political [Red Tide),\nor emotional [Scars) but his lyrics are typically cryptic\nand either incredibly intelligent or to ally pretentious\naccording to your degree of cynicism.\nThe album opens with Show Don't Tell and Chain\nLightning which are both typical classy Rush songs.\nThe music is nervous, never settling into a mundane\nverse-chorus-solo sequence but darting between\nrhythms and tempos as Lee and Lifeson pass the lead.\nWhen the style does relax on The Pass and the\nstrangely titled Anagram (For Mongol it does so\nmelodically but never approaches the an the mic stadia\nrock of Bon Jovi. Producer Rupert Hines adds backing\nvocals on the obvious single Superconductor but the\nbest is saved to the end of each side. Both Presto and\nAvailable Light are songs of the highest cal libre that\nhave a timeless quality which will make them instant\nfavourites for the faithful.\nPresto is unlikely to win Rush new fame and fortune\nbut it will not lose them any old fans for whom the\nproblem is now having to wait at least twelve months\nbefore there is any possibility of a tour.\nCDL.\n\n"

    "content": "The Dream Team\nTake four inmates of a mental hospital. Abandon them\nin the city. Put their doctor in hospital with two bent\ncops attempting to kill him. You've got the Dream\nTeam.\nPutting an out-of-place person/group in a city and\n'see how they cope' is a theme that has been used\nin many movies, from Crocodile Dundee to Star Trek\nIV. In this case, it works particularly well. Each of the\nfour 'lunatics' is well defined, the characters\nenhanced by some delightful acting. Michael Batman\nKeaton as Caulfield, uncontrollably violent author and\nChristoper Lloyd as Sikorsky, who's not sure what\nside of the Doctor/Patient relationship he is on, to a certain degree carry the film, but the supporting acting\nis well above average.\nThe plot is a bit wooly, but then that's not what the\nfilm is about. Instead, watch the relationship between\nthe inmates change, as they come to terms with their\nown, and their companions' problems, and start the\nlong climb back to sanity.\nThere is also a liberal sprinkling of humour and\naction throughout the film, but it always seems\nperfectly natural. The one worry that this film does\nprovoke in me though, is that much of the time we\nare being encouraged to laugh at people with a serious\nmental disability.\nThis is partially off-set by the sympathy with which\nthey are treated the rest of the time, and some\nmoral ising about the use of drugs in psychiatric\ntreatment, and the establishment's attitude to\nsufferers trying to re integrate themselves into society.\nOverall, a good comedy, well worth seeing, and\ncertainly the best thing Keaton's done so far.\nAdam T. The cook, the\nthief, his wife\n& her lover\nSuperficially this film can be seen as a simple tale of\nlove, lust and revenge: The Cook heads a high-flying\nrestaurant, 'Le Hollandais' famous for its innovative\ncuisine. It is taken over by gangland boss, The Thief,\nwhose spouse, His Wife, falls in lust with a reclusive\nin tell ecu tal, Her Lover. Lust leads to love, and from\nlove to jealousy, to revenge and counter-revenge.\nFrom another viewpoint it could be seen as a clash\nof cultures, Philistine vs Athenian. One typified by the\nvulgar Englishman who aspires after style and class,\nbut who cannot possess either. The other by the\nFrench cook, for whom desire is the source of life.\nHunger and lust are the foundation of all that is\nbeautiful and glorious. But The Thief is blind to this\nworld of sensual pleasure, and he despises the base\nimpulses which ensnare him. To one the delights of\nsex resemble those of eating, to the other they are\nmore like shitting.\nHowever the strength of this film does not lie either\nin the story or any particular moral that one might like\nto draw from it, but rather in the way that it is told.\nGreenaway, who both wrote and directed, masterfully\nexploits his medium, perhaps even surpassing it, he\nstimulates all five senses, rather than the mere two\nwhich fate has allowed him. The smells of the food\n(and other things) seem to pervade the film. His\ntheatrical use of colour is also important. Each setting\nis characterised by a tint, whose change often signals\na transition of mood in the characters.\nThe acting is also of a very high standard, Michael\nGambon, and Helen Mirren as Thief and Wife, are\nparticularly notable. It is pleasant to see a beautifully\nsensual role going to a more mature actress than\nperhaps Hollywood would have considered. She is\ncertainly no disappointment. Costumes by Jean-Paul\nGaultier and music by Michael Nyman, add the final\ntouches to this already beautiful work.\nThe Cook, The Thief, His Wife & Her Lover is a sensual extravaganza. I should however point out that\nit does contain some rather gory moments that some\npeople might find disturbing. But with that aside, I can\nthoroughly recommend it. Its images will remain with\nyou for years.\nMatthew G Johnson.\nHow to analyse handwriting\nMy first reaction on seeing this book and reading the\nfirst few pages was that it seemed very simplistic,\nmuch more so than any other book of this type I have\nread before. Having done a little graphology before,\nI expected quite a detailed book such that anyone with\nthe time and patience could perform a detailed\nanalysis of a sample of handwriting. Instead the book\nis very basic, concentrating on the letters 'i','t' and\nthe personal pronoun T with a passing mention to the\nstyle spacing size and pressure of the sample.\nOnce you begin to use the book the simplistic nature\nof the contents reveal themselves by the fact that\nvery few personality traits are revealed except the all\nimportant SEX characteristics. A whole chapter is\ngiven over to sexuality and lust, perhaps this shows\nher priorities?\nThere are some summary tables through the book\nallowing a hasty analysis of a sample, although it is\nbest not to do it to friends or family for not only do\nyou think you know them too well but also any bad\nsigns in the sample will make you feel awkward as\nto whether or not to tell them.\nUnusually for a book on this subject she does\ninclude a couple of chapters of doodles and in\nparticular trees. This is a novel and interesting idea,\nand is perhaps one of the book's better parts. It does\nseem strange, almost contrived that the roots of the\ntree mean the past, and conversely the foliage the\npresent. This, along with other obvious points (such\nas fast, hurried writing means a fast active\npersonality) often lead to scepticism.\nFinally, there are the chapters that are devoted to\nself glorification, 'oh look what famous people I have\nmet', with character analysis that anyone in the street\ncould make from the way the people act and talk.\nAfter saying this, as a general introduction into a subject that you must take seriously it is quite good\nin places (after all many employees use graphology\nwith other methods for interview pre-selection). It is\na bit expensive and, at only one 150 pages, not\nparticularly good value for money.\nIf you feel that you would like to find out more about\nan interesting subject then try the library first and later\non if you want to, find a good book and perhaps start\nclimbing the ladder of Wl meetings to the heady\nheights that Ms O 'Hara has.\nIan Hodge.\nPage 7\n\n"

    "content": "THE\nBARON of\n'Ho ho ho, Derek!' said Mad Dash festively, as she\npinned up another length of tinsel. Her husband, Derek\nDash, sighed. It was hard enough being Baron of\nCheapskate without having to be jolly as well. Now\nhe was going to have to dress up in a silly red and\nwhite suit and a glued-on, curly beard. All the tiny\ncitizens would tug at it and spill jelly over him. It was\nmost unpleasant.\n'I'm going for a walk,' he said gloomily, shaking off\nthe piles of baubles and crackers which had fallen on\nhim. 'But Derek, you've got so much to do for the\nChristmas Party!' cried Mad Dash in an anguished\nvoice. She couldn't understand why Derek wasn't as\nenthusiastic as she was about the party. After all, he\nalways seemed to have so much fun with the tiny\ncitizens...\nMeanwhile, in the PHALLIX Office in a dingy corner\nof Bite Polygon, Rave Smuggly was opening his post.\nThe biggest item was a huge box of orange paper\nchains. '\nI didn't order a huge box of orange paper\nchains,' he said, sounding puzzled. 'In fact, I didn't order any paper chains at all.'\n'Just a minute, there's a note', said Rose Petal, the\nPHALLIX typesetter operator. 'Dear Rave, thought\nyou might like some decorations for your office. Merry\nChristmas, love Prof Dicks, Head of the Doctor and\nNurse citizens,' she read. '\nI recognise that shade of\norange,' said Inky Thompson, the PHALLIX printer.\n'Oh look, if you look really closely you can see naughty\npictures on the chains!'\nBut before they could discuss the paper chains any\nfurther, a tiny citizen came hurtling through the\nPHALLIX office door on its tricycle. 'It might have\nopened it first,' thought Rave sourly, surveying the\nwreckage. But without saying a word, the tiny citizen\nhanded Rose a small piece of paper and pedalled away\nvery quickly.\n'Come to the Mad Dash Christmas Bash,' said the\nmessage on the paper. 'Come one, come all-come\nyoung, come old-if you like jelly and screaming,\nsticky-fingered tiny citizens you'll have a whale of a time!' Rave, Rose and Inky looked at each other in\nhorror. 'I'd better put it in PHALLIX,' said Rave, 'or\nwe'll all get dragged along.'\nJohn Secretary took a final, sad look around his office\nin Surefield Castle and switched out the light for the\nlast time. On his way down the corridor he passed the\noffice of House of Frazer, the new Manager of\nCheapskate, who was taking over Secretary's job.\nThrough the cracks around Frazer's door, John\nSecretary could just make out the glow of the flashing\nneon sign which had been installed in the window.\n'Cheapskate-probably the best school in the\nworld-unbeatable value,' it said. Suddenly a pounding disco beat started up. 'La la la...Cheapskate,\nCheapskate, Cheapskate, the one for m eee! Now I'm happy as can be ee! Derek the Baron is number one!\nWe're all having lots of fun!' crooned the singers.\n'Oh hello Secretary are you off, then?' asked Derek,\nwho had just stepped out of the lift. 'That's the new\nSong for Cheapskate-good isn't it?' He said, shaking\noff a piece of tinsel which was stubbornly ent an lge d in his hair. 'Houseof had it mixed by Stock, Aitken &\nThingybob I think. It's going quite well in the charts,\ntoo. Anyway, I was just off to talk to him about the\nnew Cheapskate theme park we're planning. Houseof\nthinks it'll be terribly profitable.' He stopped, and his\nvoice took on a softer tone. 'Well, we will miss you,'\nhe said insincerely. 'Keep in touch, eh?' Then he\nwalked off, humming the 'Song for Cheapskate\".\nSecretary sighed and shook his head, then he turned\nand left Cheapskate forever.\n\u2022 Will anyone survive the Christmas Bash?\n\u2022 Will John Secretary buy any shares in Cheapskate\npic?\ntWill there ever be another episode of....\nTHE BARON OF CHEAPSKATE!\nThe Christmas Caper\nSo, you think it's all over on December 15th?

What would\ndo if somebody told you, you 'd won a Christmas hamper in a raffle you didn't know about, and what w you want in it? Of course there was also the question of the Christmas Caper... (All the 'lucky' winners\nactually won a bottle of wine courtesy of FELIX.)\nRob Northey\u2014Refectories\nFelix. Hello is that Mr R Northey?\nRob Northey: Speaking\nFelix: I 've got some rather good news for you. You've\nwon a Christmas hamper worth \u00a335 via the HUB\nOffice.\nRob: Oh God! what do I have t q do for it?\nFelix: It's been done through the payroll slips and your\nnumber was the lucky number.\nRob: Jolly good.\nFelix: The thing is we actually need a list to submit\nto Harrods to tell them what you actually require, so...\nRob: Oh, I tell you what, if you send a list down to\nmy secretary and she'll sort it out.\nFelix: OK we might have to phone you back on that.\nWe haven't got an actual list, it's just a matter of\ntaking down what you would prefer. I mean Harrods\nis quite a big shop. Have you got any particular, for\nexample, favourite champagne? We could stretch to\nthat in the \u00a335.\nRob: I don't want any food because I'm away. I'm out\nof the country for Christmas.\nFelix: Right so wine and spirits would probably be best\nfor you.\nRob: Wine and spirits would be the nicest thing.\nFelix: Anything in particular?\nRob: No I 'll leave it all to you.\nFelix: OK. It makes it rather difficult actually because\nI'm just a temp and I need to...\nRob: Chortle, chortle.\nFelix: ...get a list from you. So what shall we say then?\nMoet and Chandon champagne? Do you drink\nchampagne for example?\nRob: Yes, yes we drink champagne.\nFelix: OK champagne, and, for example, whisky, err...\nRob: Whisky or brandy don't mind which.\nPage 22\nFelix: OK, I suppose if you're away you won't want\nany kind of relishes.\nRob: No thank you (laughs).\nRelix: Cigarettes for example?\nRob: No, no I'm going to buy duty frees on those.\nMake it up with some wine.\nFelix: Right OK.\nRob: But don't buy the Liebfraumilch.\nFelix: err....\nRob: Don't buy me Liebfraumilch or something like\nthat.\nFelix: No Liebfraumilch, OK.\nRob: Dry whites or nice reds.\nFelix: Preferably French I suppose.\nRob: Yes. Yes.\nFelix: We'll have to stick to that then.\nRob: How did they do this then, sort of...\nFelix: I'm not sure, as I say I'm just a temp for a couple\nof days...\nRob: How many people have won?\nFelix: We've got three. The hampers are worth\ndifferent amounts. Yours happens to be the medium\none.\nRob: Oh, well. Thank you very much indeed.\nFelix: The thing is that you might have to collect this\nfrom the Christmas Caper. Because it's being run in\nconjunction with HUB.\nRob: Chortle, chortle. I'm not here then. I'm away that\nweekend.\nFelix: Oh that's quite fortunate, ha ha.\nRob: Unfortunately I 've got to go to my parents for\nChristmas before I go away, so...\nFelix: Oh never mind.\nRob: So I shan't be here unfortunately.\nGeoff Reeves\nChief Security\nOfficer\nGeoff: Security.\nFelix: Hello yes, could I speak to Mr G Reeves please?\nGeoff: That's me.\nFelix: Hello, I 've got some rather good news for you\nactually. You have won...via the HUB office...a Christmas hamper.\nGeoff: I have?\nFelix: Yes, I'm phoning from personnel. We are\nrunning a special payroll raffle in conjunction with the\nHUB office. And you've won a Christmas hamper\nworth \u00a335 which is the 2nd prize.\nGeoff: Good grief! How did I do that? I didn't go in\nfor a raffle.\nFelix: No it's actually just done through the payroll\nnumbers apparently, so I 've been told.\nGeoff: Hee! Heel Ha! Ho! Ho!\nFelix: And I 've been given the job to phone you up and\nask you what you would like in the hamper. Have you\ngot any preferences? It's actually being ordered\nthrough Harrods.\nGeoff: From Harrods?!?\nFelix: Yes, so I mean you've probably got quite a broad\nrange of things. Other people seem to have gone for\nwines and spirits. I don't know if you have any\npreferences there at all.\nGeoff: Yes, yes a jolly good idea, ha ha, ho ho.\nFelix: Brandy, scotch, whatever?\nGeoff: Port.\nFelix: Port?\nGeoff: Port, yes and brandy, erm....crystallised\nfruits...\nFelix: (controlled laughter and long pause) Yes.\nGeoff: All the things I never normally get like\nhomemade chocolates?\nFelix: Homemade chocolates, yes I think they do quite\na nice range.\nGeoff: And then if there's anything left...wine.\nFelix: OK, so wine made up with the remainder?\nGeoff: Well that will probably take care of it I would\nthink.\nFelix: I would think so at Harrods, yes.\nGeoff: Yes, I 'll probably get two chocolates!! Ho! Ho!\nFelix: I don't know. For \u00a3351 would think you'd have\nquite a range.\nGeoff: Yes quite extraordinary. How did this idea\ncome about?\nFelix: I'm not really sure actually. To be honest I'm a temp and I 've just been given the job to phone\npeople.\nThe thing is the arrangement for collecting the\nhamper might be from the Christmas Caper. Will you\nbe there?\nGeoff: Er, I can't come along I'm afraid, but it can be\nleft in my room, no problem.\nFelix: Well we can come to some other arrangement\non that. OK? Thanks, bye.\nGeoff: Bye.\n\n"

    "content": "In Country\nAfter the glut of Vietnam films a few years ago\n[Platoon, Full Metal Jacket et al), In Country takes a somewhat different approach.\nSamantha Hughes (Emily Lloyd, with an American\naccent l has just graduated from High School in\nHopewell, Kentucky. She lives with her uncle Emmet\n(Bruce Willis),'. ,er father having been killed in Vietnam.\nHer mother has since remarried and moved to\nLexington. While searching through the things her\nmother left behind, she finds some letters written by\nher father, while he was in Vietnam. Her need to\ndiscover more about her father will touch three\ngenerations of her family, herself, her uncle and her\ngrandmother, and leads to them eventually coming to\nterms with the legacy of the war, at the Vietnam\nveterans' memorial.\nThe small town American backdrop is beautiful\nrecreated, with many incidental characters, who\ncontribute little to the plot, greatly enhancing it. Emily\nLloyd overplays things a little at first, but soon settles\ndown into a very competent performance. Bruce Willis\nis the big surprise, giving a very sympathetic portrayal,\nwith a character that has a remarkably small screen\npresence.\nThe photography is often superb. The Vietnam\nflashbacks are all shot at night, with present day\nscenes in bright daylight. Occasionally as characters\nmentally move back to Vietnam we do have present\nday shots in the dark-a clever and dramatically\neffective device.\nThe pace is always slow, suiting the mood of the\nfilm perfectly. Thoughtful and intelligent, it carefully\ninterweaves moments of tragedy, drama and humour,\nto provide a thought-provoking and moving whole. It\nis always totally convincing, and the final scene at the\nVietnam veteran's memorial is very emotional, while\nsteering well clear of corny sentimentality.\nA superb film, well worth the asking price and which\nI can genuinely recommend. It opens on Jan 12.\nIf 1990s releases continue like this, we're in for a good year.\nAdam T. Silent Thunder Loren D Estlman\nSet in Detroit, a city de sci bed by the author as 'the\ncity that the American dream stalled in and sat down\nto rust', it is a story of murder and gun smuggling that\nat points becomes hard to believe but is always\ngripping and compelling. Constance Thayer is accused\nof murdering her husband while he lay drunk and\nasleep on the floor. She is claiming it was self-defence\nas there had been a history of abuse, both physical\nand sexual such to drive anyone to commit justifiable\nhomicide. Unfortunately she does not have the most\npure of backgrounds, having been involved in both\npornographic films and drugs.\nAdded to this, the fact that the dead man was the\nson of one of the city's wealthiest man and you can\nsee that the lawyer, one of the best in the country\nis in for a hard time.\nHis job seems to have been made very much easier\nwhen the police discover a stash of arms in the\nbasement of the couple's house, but to make sure a private investigator is called in to dig as much dirt as\nhe can.\nAmos Walker is a man with a thousand friends but\na thousand and one enemies. He is a detective of the\nold school,dark raincoat pulled tight against the chill,\nhat dipped to cover mysterious eyes with sinister\nPage 6\nhappenings in dark dank allies. Sent out to find as\nmany skeletons in the cupboard as he can, he soon\nbecomes entangled in a net of shady figures who for\nsome unknown reason become resentful and try to\nkill him.\nThe book then details events until the timely\nintervention of the police saves the day and everybody\nlives happily ever after, (except all the unfortunates\nthat get killed on the way).\nOverall the book is well written and as, I have said,\nas believable as a book of this sort can be, things do\nbecome a little stretched when a Polaris missile\nbecomes involved!\nThe narrative is well done with the typical PI\nobservations faithfully used, but without the\nfashionable puns and jokes. It keeps the story\ninteresting even through the inevitable slow parts,\nmeaning that there is always something worth reading\nthrough the whole of the book.\nCharacter development is a little shaky but the main\ncharacters are detailed enough for you to understand\ntheir actions in relation with the rest of the book.\nAmos himself is actually quite well described although\nmuch of what you discover about his character is from\nhis actions rather than the narrative. He is the sort of\nThe Chocolate\nWar\nThe Chocolate War takes place in a Catholic school\nfor boys called St Trinity's and concerns the annual\nfund raising chocolate sale. But do not be misled by\nthe apparent innocence of the setting, this is a tale\nof power, avarice and sheer malevolence. The acting\nheadmaster, Brother Leon, in a bid to further his\ncareer, decides to double both the price and sale\nquotas. In order to ensure success, he enlists the help\nof the local syndicate of bullies, named 'the Vigils',\nwhose leader, Archie, readily accepts the challenge,\nas a means to increase his own power and\nrecognition. At first the sale goes badly, hindered\nespecially by the refusal of a particular boy (Jerry) to\nsell any chocolates. But Archie exploits his\nindividuality, and identifying Jerry as s symbol of hate,\nunites the school against him.\nThe film is an intricate study of dictatorship in\nminiature, containing all the principal elements of its\nlarger brothers: quotas, secret police, idealists, witch\nhunts etc. But present in this abstract, allegorical\nform, it perhaps allows us to see the issues with\ngreater clarity. Brother Leon, driven blindly toward his\ngoal, will stop at nothing to achieve it. His is a so lips is tic world, inhabited only by him and his dream,\npeople are mere counters on the board. Archie, the\nleader of the Vigils, is more conscious of others, but\nthis realisation serves only as a means to a greater\nevil, in his cruel manipulation of Jerry. What is\nparticularly chilling is the frank admission of evil, and\ntotal lack of compunction in releasing it. Both John\nGlover as Brother Leon, and Wally Ward as Archie give\ncommendable menacing performances. Unfortunately\ntheir victim, Jerry (played by Lian Mitchell-Smith) is\nnot quite so convincing. His is a role that demands\na great deal of pathos, and what sympathy we feel\nfor him, comes more from the malice of his\ntormentors, than from his own efforts.\nThis is a very emotive film, and one which is likely\nto make you sit and reflect. The music which\naccompanies it is excellent, but with names like Kate\nBush, Peter Gabriel, and JS Bach (who he?), that is\nnot particularly surprising. If the subject matter is of\ninterest then this is undoubtedly a film to see.\nMatthew G Johnson.\nperson that won't let sleeping dogs lie and so even\nwhen he is fired he continues to search for clues that\nbecome vital to the case.\nThe rest of the characters, from the gun dealers to\nthe police and the other incidental people, are\nreasonably well done although, with about three\ndifferent types of police, it is hard to know who\nbelongs to what.\nThe book is well structured although the ending I feel was slightly rushed and overall the book felt rather\ncramped being only just over 200 pages long. Perhaps\nan extra 50 pages would have given the book a more\nrounded end and tied off some of the loose ends that\nwere left dangling.\nOne glaring example of this is the fact that the\noutcome of the trial is never given, in fact the trial\ndoes not even begin, perhaps another book is on the\nway?\nLoren D Estlman has written eight other Amos\nSalker books with much critical a claim, much of which\nI am sure he deserves, but as far as this book goes\nit is fairly good but not brilliant, wait for the paperback.\nIan Hodge.\n\n"

    "content": "Charlie English went to Berlin two weeks ago to see the new Berlin...\nTear down the wall!\nSaturday; an early morning snowfall and below-zero\ntemperatures don't deter people in their thousands\nfrom chipping away at the Berlin Wall. Freezing hands\nwield hammers, chisels, screwdrivers and even\numbrellas against The Wall in an attempt to get hold\nof what must be amongst the most prized souvenirs\nin Europe.\nThe authorities on both sides seem uncertain as to\nwhat to do. East German border guards patrol on top\nof the Wall at the Brandenberg Gate, unarmed,\nwatching perplexed ly as people as far as they can see\nare gradually destroying the thing on which they\nstand. West German police, after clamping down on\nwall-chipping last week, now only half-hearted ly try\nto stop it. The result is a now gap-toothed barrier as\npeople scrape and tap away the poor quality cement\nand concrete removing slivers from the joints between\nthe prefabricated blocks. The little flakes that are\nremoved are rumoured to be worth up to $5000 in\nthe States, so for many in Berlin what two weeks ago\nmug ht have been a statement for freedom has now\nbecome a lucrative business.\nMeanwhile the East Germans themselves wander\naround cautiously tasting capitalism like a first sip of\nbeer after a long period without-'l don't really need\nit but...'. Temptation often wins in the end. A queue\nfor a 'Sex Show' stretches into the street; easterners\nwalk past parked cars reading out brand names\n'Volvo...Mercedes...BMW...' and clutching stereo\nradio cassettes. Cigarette manufacturers haven't been\nslow to spot the opportunity, revelling in the vast new\npotential market of denim clad Marlboro men. Girls are\nemployed to hand out cigarettes and leaflets to\namazed East Germans as if they were at a sponsored\nevent; 'Come together-learn to live as friends-Peter\nStuyvesant.' 'The West is Best' proclaims a huge\nMarlboro banner over a railway bridge.\nBut the glory of the moment is not lost by the\ncynicism of advertising. Walking alongside The Wall\npeople peer through the ever widening cracks as if\nthey will see something monstrous on the other side,\nas if the wooden watch towers to look over into the\nEast do not exist. A group huddle round a tiny gap,\nstraining to see an East German border guard,\nexchanging addresses, even buying pieces of wall for\nDeutschmarks. The intermittent flow of 'Trabbies' is\ninterrupted for a moment by a breakdown: at once ten\nWest Germans gather round to help sort out the\nproblem, anxious to see the engine.\nIn the American sector, near Checkpoint Charlie, a couple of guys are breaking off large slabs with a sledge-hammer and handing it away to people. Here\nGermans are almost outnumbered by American forces\npersonnel, some still in uniform, come for their bit; '\nI been here two and half years, I'd like a piece'. Some\nspeculate how much longer they will be in West\nGermany: graffiti proclaims 'Checkpoint Charlie, made\nredundant 9 Nov 1989'. Untrue, but typically\noptimistic.\nIt has to be appropriate for this embodiment of the\nCold War to be eaten away slowly by thousands of\nhands each taking away their own little fragments.\nThis probably isn't the end of the East-West divide,\nperhaps not even the end of the divided Berlin, and\nmaybe these people's motives are not entirely\nunselfish; yet there cannot be a more telling symbol\nof popular opinion than the image of thousands of\npeople, from all over the free world, spontaneously\nand simultaneously tapping away at The Wall.

    "content": "There go your job prospects...\nDear Editor,\nHaving not had the opportunity to read the original\narticle on Pornography (I am one of those Mary's medics seen by Professor Richards as being incapable\nof deciding for myself what is or isn't suitable reading\nmaterial) I found MG Johnson's letter (issue 851)\nanything but well reasoned. Ignoring his somewhat\npedantic argument on the definition and aims of\npornography, I quote the def in in it ion given by CAP\n(Campaign Against Pornography). Pornography is 'any\ndepiction of women or parts of women's bodies which\nobject if ies them, de human is es them, portrays them\nin a sexually humiliating and degrading manner and\nsubjects them to sexual violence with the message\nthat women enjoy this'.\nYou may hold that 'models' have a choice: Firstly\nit is to be questioned how much of a real choice they\nactually have-if you are faced with the alternatives\nof a poorly paid job and the chance of earning vast\nsums (MGJ says \u00a3200 as a one off payment) the\npressures to become involved in the 'meat market' are\nenormous. Secondly, if the women involved are seen\nto have a choice, and taken that they do, then that\nchoice is exercised by them on behalf of all women.\nThey define the way society per cie ves women and\nwomen's bodies making it impossible to 'ignore it if\nyou don't like it' as he suggests.\nIf MGJ really believes pornography portrays women\nas 'sensual beings' then I suggest he has never been\nsubjected to pornographic material. One is left with\nan impression of women as passive sexual objects,\nwilling participants in sexual violence, enjoying rape,\nsaying 'no' when they mean 'yes', as bodies without\nminds, feelings or personality. In short 'tits & bums'.\nLiz Warren has not conducted sufficient research;\nthe links between pornography and sexual violence\nagainst women and children cannot easily be\ndismissed. Recent studies show this more\nconclusively than those linking smoking and cancer.\nIf my letter is beginning to sound like feminist\npro pog and a then let me redress the balance.\nPornography is not solely a degrading treatment of\nwomen. Surely men too are exploited by the porn\nindustry. To suggest that men are controlled and\nmotivated by their sexuality and are subject to\nuncontrollable sexual drives is to say that men are little\nbetter than animals. Some argue pornography\nprovides some men with a release which would\notherwise be turned against women. I argue that\nsexual violence should not be 'treated' with\npornographic material which encourages the very\nattitudes towards women which result in the problem\nin the first place.\nA stand against pornography is not an example of\n'Anglo-Saxon prudery', and does not deny women\nand men their sexuality; it is saying that people should\nbe able to define their own sexuality and not be\nsubjected to images in magazines which define how\nthey will be seen and how they should act.\nJC Woodhouse.\n|\"\"\"MACINTOSH \"Ifustrators\" \" \"\njj wanted jj \u2022 Are you fully familiar with the A||)|| Macintosh?\n\u2022 \u2022 Could you produce high quality Illustrations for text\nbooks and journals?\n| \u2022 Do you want to:earn money from \\li>ur Mac in your\n| spare time?\n\u2014Then we may have some work for you.

    "content": "Liz Warren gives an account on what to do when the parents get too much.\nLondon over Christmas\nIf you are in London over Christmas or you have to\nescape from the parents by new year, why not try\nsome of the ideas below.\nFor the strong willed there is the old traditional\nfavorite of going to Trafalgar Square to see the new\nyear (and indeed the new decade) in. Although this\nis probably worth doing once in your life it can be very\nunpleasant. You will almost certainly find yourself in\nthe middle of a large, mostly good-natured crowd, but\ncrowds have a mind of their own and can be extremely\ndangerous when, after all the excitement of midnight\nhas gone, the surge to leave the square begins. It's best to go in a big group, but you have to link arms\nvery firmly to avoid getting split up. Watch out for\ngroups of 'steamers' who attempt to break groups up\nand pick pocket them. As the end of the decade, this\nis probably not the year to try Trafalgar Square.\nfairground rides, and in Carnaby Street, where there\nwill be shows, music and carols until December 22nd. Carnaby Street also promises an alternative Christmas\nGrotto.\nFor more leisurely entertainment indoors, BBC\nseems to have the pick of the films, with Crocodile\nDundee on Christmas Day and the Name of the Rose\non Boxing Day. The latter is not to be missed if you\nhaven't seen it yet. Videos which have just been\nreleased which are worth getting out are Who Framed\nRoger Rabbit (the animation is very clever), Rainman\nand Twins. Venturing out to the cinema, the best bets\nare Back to the Future II,, a sequel which is as good\nas the original, Wilt, Dead Poets' Society (a real\nwee pie) and the Dream Team (see reviews). If you\nhaven't seen Batman yet, go and see it. Jack\nNicholson steals the film, but it's also a good no-cost you two pounds to get in.\nFor taking in some culture, most of the museums\nare open around Christmas, although not on Bank\nHolidays. The Museum of the Moving Image at the\nSouth Bank is a 'fun' museum with lots of interesting\nthings for anyone who has even a passing interest in\nfilms. At the Royal Academy on Picadilly, The Art of\nPhotography 1839-1989 is highly recommended and\ncontinues until December 23rd. An alternative to Trafalgar Square is to find a nice\npub and see through midnight: you'll end up hugging\nand kissing people you've never seen before and will\nnever see again! Recommended, if crowded, pubs are\nthe Punch and Judy in Covent Garden, any of the pubs\non the river near Hammersmith Bridge, especially The\nDove (although it's very small), downstairs at The\nKing's Head on Wardour Street and any Firkin Pub.\nkit \u2022 MBA more civilised alternative is to go to a pantomime\nand prove that you're still a kid at heart and like booing\nand hissing with the six year olds. There are traditional\npan to s, such as Cinderella (Duchess Theatre \u00a39),\nBabes in the Wood (Beck Theatre) or Dick Whittington\nand His Cat (Shaw Theatre \u00a35.5-\u00a38 with Bill Oddie).\nThere is a ballet version of Cinderella at the Royal\nOpera House if you fancy a cultured version. For the\nalternative pan to, try the Drill Hall Arts Centre's lesbian version of The Snow Queen, the Latchmere\nTheatre's adaptation of The Rose and The Ring (see\nReviews for both) or the cult version of Return to the\nForbidden Planet at the Cambridge Theatre.\nThere will be street events at Covent Garden on the\nEast Piazza until December 24th, which should include\nPage 32\nnonsense adventure film that doesn't strain the brain\ntoo much. Whether you think it's worth all the hype\nis up to you.\nAfter you've overindulged in the turkey and\nChristmas pudding, why not go for a walk in one of\nthe parks. You can feed the remains of dinner to the\nducks in St James Park, wander along the Grand\nUnion Canal which runs from Little Venice to Camden\nthrough Regents Park or visit Richmond Park and\nmake believe that you're not in the city at all. While\nyou're in Regents Park, you might like to visit London\nZoo, although there aren't any bears there at the\nmoment. Another fun day out is to go to the races\nat Kempton Park on Boxing Day. You can catch a train\nfrom Waterloo to Kempton Park BR Station, and it will\nYou could try a day trip to France to stock up on\nthe Christmas booze. It's about ten pounds return by\nSealink from Folkstone to Boulogne, and you'll have\nto get to Folkstone first. Or why not go the whole hog,\nforget Christmas altogether and book yourself a nice\nholiday to a sunny Caribbean paradise.\nBEANS CLUB\nIntimate dinners for four\narranged personally\nContact P.

    "content": "Daytime TV twaddle I 've been video inga lot of daytime television lately.\nThe programmers who claim standards will decline\nwhen de-regulation comes into force need look no\nfurther than their own back yard.\nThe day usually gets off to a start with a game\nshow. The ITV regions ex cell at this sort of\nprogramming. From the channel that brought you\nAVame that Tune and That's My Dog comes Keynotes.\nPresented by a redundant DJ as nearly all these\nshows are-our first glimpse is of the contestants.\nFrom then on, it's downhill all the way.\nThe idea of Keynotes appears to be to guess the\nnext word in a song. The contestants are clearly hand\npicked from Mensa's finest judging by the challenging\nquestions. (7 want to be a part of it, New York, New\n****'!. Last week's programme featured Jim, looking\nremarkably like the token 'lovable cockney character'\none sees in every sitcom Thames produces. Jim was\nclearly getting carried away with it all. So much so,\nin fact, that he kept clapping his hands throughout the\nwhole show-even when he got an answer wrong.\nThis pales into insignificance, however, on flipping\nchannels. Every morning, that guardian of morals, is\nthere to promote everything that is good -Kilroy!\nRobert Kilroy-Silk interviewing technique has\napparently been gleaned from the Daily Mirror School\nof Journalism. In comes the camera for the close-up\nof the victim's face, dim the house lights, speak in\na soft melancholy tone-watch those tears start\nflooding. The main feature of Kilroy! that sets it apart\nfrom the other crap talk shows is the resident n utter. It is a little-known fact that a researcher is employed\nto scour the tube for head cases in order to reach a quota of five per week.\nDuring remembrance week, Kilroy-Silk interviewed\na studio full of war widows demanding a higher\npension. With the whole audience in agreement, our\nRobert must have been thinking of ways to pad the\nprogramme out to an hour. To his rescue, up jumped\na fruitcake.\n'I wouldn't give any of you a penny. Your husbands\nknew they might die\u2014it's your own fault'. A verbal\nmelee promptly broke out. One old dear, fighting back\nthe tears, wished Mr Fruitcake was dead.\nThe same n utter appeared a week later disguised\nas an 80 year-old army vet. The subject was\nvandalism. The old boy told a moving story of how\nhis garden was continually ruined by 'young thugs of\nsubnormal intelligence'. His story started to go sour\non telling of how he'd frightened them off with his\nshotgun.\n'And they got away did they?' asked Kilroy through\nfeigned concern. 'Well, one of them did', replied the\nn utter, 'but I blew the other one away'.\nWhat sort of producer would allow this form of\nentertainment? Yes, you've guessed. The producer of\nKilroy! is one Mrs Kilroy-Silk.\nWarnings of na ff television will doubtless go\nunheeded. Sky and BSB may bring programming\nbudgets down to pocket money; deregulation will\nprobably bring standards plummet ting. But in terms\nof really good, bad television, BBC and ITV will be\nscooping the awards for years to come.\nGiveaway\nCalculating\nThere has been a lot of talk lately of the national\ncurriculum. This catch-all syllabus, which is being\nintroduced into all state-funded schools, is subject to\nmuch debate.\nMany aspects of it are worrying. The need for\nteachers to be good administrators instead of able\ntutors is one that springs to mind.\nHaving read the maths section of the curriculum,\nI have to say that one tiny detail horrified me. Children\nfrom the age of six upwards are being taught how to\nuse calculators.\nCalculators and computers work very well. They\nallow complex sums to be carried out quickly and with\nease. What they were not designed for was replacing\ntraditional mental arithmetic.\nThe rot started four or five years ago when some\nbright spark realised that Britain had gone metric. As\nthe base of this new system is ten, it was no longer\nnecessary to continue with duodecimal practises.\nTimes tables only went up to ten. If you wanted to\nwork out 11 x11 or 12 x12, you had to write it down.\nPresumably the same high flyer at the DES is\nresponsible for this new situation. Mental arithmetic\nis not an asset or a useful tool-it is essential. Children\nmust, of course, be taught how to use calculators and\nthe like, but it should be a second priority. The\noverriding one is to learn the methods of how sums\nare computed.\nOne day the batteries will run dry. Unfortunately,\nso will the brain power of this generation's kids.\nRoll up, roll up! Join in with the latest Government\ngiveaway!\nFrom the party that brought you:\n\u2022 Japanese nee British Gas pic (name changed in aid\nof foreign investors; tell Syd).\n\u2022 H20( the only share offer guaranteed to be floated,\nbecause everything floats in British water, even the\nfish), and\n\u2022 British Telecom ('Melvyn?

This fine band play\na mixture of hard-rocking songs and slow lilting tunes\ntelling stories of love, hate and Belfast. Playing North\nLondon pubs two years ago, Energy Orchard were\nrecognised for the talents they have and soon had gigs\nat major London venues, including The Marquee and\nImperial College.\nAfter much media interest and attention from record\nRCC bonanza\nLadies and Gentlemen, I would like to introduce the\ngreat Recreational Clubs Committee bonanza. The\nfailure of anyone to admit their existence means that\nI am able to announce vacancies for Chairpeople of\nthe following clubs:\nAir Cooled Volkswagen; Bridge, Chess; Waterski.\nThese clubs have Union grants and assets available\nto support their operation. If you wish to take on the\nduties of caretaker Chairperson contact me. I can give\nyou details of what is on offer. The best time to find\nme is at the RCC Treasurer's Meeting, in the Union\nOffice, 12.30 to 1.00pm every Wednesday.\nAll I will ask is that you write an article for Felix to\ncompany spies, they finally signed a huge deal with\nMCA and are on the brink of releasing their debut\nalbum. After the New Year the band are off to\nAmerica for a tour of just about every corner of every\nstate. Watch out for the lead singer's death defying\nspeaker stack jump. Be there!

The Jazz class has been\ncancelled as there was not enough interest. The\nsecond beginners' Rock 'n' Roll class, started due to\npopular demand, has been brought forward to 2.15pm on Wednesday. A new 'Total Beginner's Ballroom\nClass' will start next term for those of you who want\na crash course for your balls! This is being held at\n6.00pm on Tuesdays in the JCR. PLease note that the\nRock 'n' Roll and Latin American classes will not start\nuntil week three (Jan 22nd) as our instructor, Vicki\nCunniffe, is taking two teams to compete in America.\nThe Ballroom lessons, however, will run as from\nJanuary 8th.

Projects vary nationwide-everything from dry stone walling, to building\nfootpaths and bridges-there is a very successful\nurban conservation scheme.

    "content": "The Delator Column\nGoing underground\nBy Paul Shanley\nIn my first column, 10 weeks ago, I expressed my\nangst over automatic ticket barriers on the\nunderground. The feedback was good-most people\nseem to share my view that these gates should be\nscrapped. The whole issue of 'progress' by London\nRegional Transport is a much wider one.\nAction is being taken to improve facilities for\npassengers. I can't help feeling that London\nUnderground have got their priorities wrong. There are\ntwo areas they are concentrating on. The first is in\nmarketing. New style trains are coming into operation,\nmore aesthetically pleasing than their predecessors.\nStations, mainly central ones, are being given new\nlicks of paint. This is obviously necessary to financially\nsecure LRT in the long term and to create an\nenvironment for travellers that is, at worst, tolerable.\nBut it is by no means a priority.\nIn terms of change, there are numerous tasks that\nmust be placed above cosmetic refurbishment on the\nlist of priorities. This leads me to the second area that\nLRT are ploughing money into; the closure of certain\nstations that require essential maintenance. Mansion\nHouse has just been closed for an estimated 15\nmonths. The escalators are being refurbished and the\nsafety level of the station as a whole is being brought\nup to scratch.\nThe changes taking place at Mansion House are\nwelcome. LRT, in a bid not to inconvenience its\ncustomers (they are no longer passengers) only closes\na number of stations at any one time. If such\nalterations are necessary, for safety reasons, it seems\nsilly to close down some unsafe stations and leave\nothers open. The real solution is to close down all\ndangerous stops so that the Underground will pass\nsafety checks in a few years time. The worst stations\nappear to be those on the older lines such as the\nBakerloo and the Northern ('Misery') line.\nA TV programme recently highlighted this. A day\nin the life of... went to Angel station (Yes, it's The\nMisery Line again, folks). Angel remains open, despite\nfrequent breakdowns of the lift. The programme saw\na couple being told that the lift was broken and that\nthey would have to use the stairs-all of them. The\nwoman was 81. Her husband was 85. It is stations\nlike Angel that have to remain closed until lifts can\nbe in operation 100% of the time.\nIn the interim, London Underground must liaise with\nits other arm, London Buses and provide shuttle buses\nto cope. This will inconvenience passengers\nconsiderably. But if a station is unsafe, isn't it better\nto close and repair it than to leave the station open\nand wait for an accident to happen?\nLast month Transport Secretary Cecil Parkinson\nunveiled plans for an extension to the Jubilee line\nrunning into Docklands. This is analogous to a small\nbusiness expanding too rapidly. By diversifying, one\nends up with a sub-standard operation. The solution\nis to consolidate one's resources first, before\nexpansion. LRT is being hasty in branching out\nwithout bringing its existing service up to an\nacceptable level, as I shall demonstrate. There are\nsolid political reasons for this argument. More party\npoints can be scored by moving into yuppie-infested\nDocklands than less well off areas such as Vauxhall\nand Lambeth.\nPage 14\nThere are other areas which LRT must improve. Not\nat the expense of safety-this must be the highest\npriority-but before cosmetic considerations are\nlooked at.\nFire equipment must be renewed and maintained.\nAdjacent to this is the need to familiaris e all staff with\nfire-fighting procedure. Recent reports suggest that\nthis area has been neglected. Again, the worst\noffenders appear to be the oldest stations such as\nthose on the extremities of the Northern line.\nMore tubes must be put into passenger service. This\nis because of the wider problem of an increase in\nunderground usage. The system has now reached a ceiling. One of the good policies that the late GLC\nimplemented was promoting public transport. The\nproblem now is that at peak hours demand has\noutstripped supply.\nPart of the problem here is the increase in\ncongestion on the roads. My belief is that this is partly\ndue to the introduction of one-man operated buses.\nOne need look no further for evidence to support this\nthan the tube and bus strikes over the summer. On\nthe days where a tube-only strike was in effect, the\nroads were bedlam. Conversely, when the buses were\nnon-operational, driving into work was a breeze.\nWhen commuters are questioned on what part of\nthe system concerns them most, the majority mention\ntheir own personal safety. Easy access to emergency\nstop buttons may help. Extra staff vigilance,\nparticularly late at night would be an asset. The\nanswer, though, has to be an extra police presence\non the tubes. The London Transport police needs to\nundergo a massive expansion. Its current staffing level\nis 400 officers, 32 of whom have been seconded from\nthe Met represents only a token presence. Londoners\nwill only feel safe on their public transport system if,\nfor exam ble, lines such as the Northern have a minimum of three officers per train.\nOne often hears of how rough the New York\nSubway is. Having travelled on it, I have to say I felt\nmore at ease than coming home on the Northern Line\nin my native South London.\nOf course minor refurbishments are needed. We\nneed better PA systems, cleaner train indicators, less\nlitter, brighter ticket halls but these can wait.\nOkay, but who's going to pay for all this? Well LRT\nspent a total of E206M last year on investment. It also\nreceived a Government subsidy of \u00a3212M. This could\nsub sid is e some of the cost. There is also the question\nof their advertisement budget-do we really need\nadverts telling us to use the tube-when we have to\nanyway? Realistically the public coffers are going to\nhave to bear a significant brunt of the cost. London\nhas the oldest underground railway in the world. In\norder for it to be the best, either the Exchequer or the\nLondon boroughs will have to delve into their pockets.\nIn conclusion, the overriding aim has be for a safe\npublic transport system. Once this is achieved, the\nmechanics of the system should be honed. Only then\nshOu d cosmetics be looked at. At present LRT is\noperating the Stock, Aitken and Waterman principle:\nThe packaging may be great but the contents are crap.\n\n"

    "content": "The story continues.\nChristmas Carol II\n'God rest ye merry gentlemen,\nLet nothing thee dismay,\nRemember Christ our Saviour\nWas born on Christmas Day...'\n'Ah...Christmas,' said Scrooge to the world in general,\n'a time of peace and goodwill to all men. Happiness\nand Joy'. He waved cheerily to the ensemble of carol\nsingers in the street below and, his heart light with\nthe thought of what was to come, he closed the\nwindow and began to change for bed.\nIt had been exactly a year since that fateful night.\nThe night when his old colleague Marley and the three\nspirits of Christmas had opened his eyes to the evil\nof his ways. He was a changed man.\nWell did he remember the horrors of that night and\nwaking the following morning with a new joy. He\nrecalled giving a whole shilling to a passing urchin,\nurging him to buy the biggest turkey he could find as\na present for dear Bob Cratchit. The fact that the\nurchin had promptly run off with the money and not\nreturned did not seem to matter.\nCratchit, loyal Bob Cratchit: Scrooge had given him\nChristmas Eve off. Thinking about it, Cratchit had also\nbeen off the week before. Indeed, Scrooge had not\nseen him in the office since mid November, apart from\nwhen he collected his now generous pay. Perhaps it\nis as well that I no longer crave money, he thought,\nfor I have very little money left to crave.\nScrooge wrapped himself in his nightgown, fitted\nhis nightcap upon his head and clambered into his\nwarm welcoming bed. He settled down amid his\nsheets and blankets and closed his eyes. Within the\ntwinkling of an eye, he was asleep.\n'Ebeneezer... Ebeneezer Scrooge.' The voice was\ncold and musty, like old books. Its very sound chilled\nthe bones. Scrooge awoke, shivering.\n'Who.. Who is it?'\n'It is I, your partner Jacob Marley'. The spectre\nfloated into view. A smile crossed his deathly white\nlips. His chains clanked as he moved. 'I am back,\nEbeneezer'\n'Marley! Gracious! What brings you here? Am I not\na transformed man?'\n'I am here upon a second, more important mission.\nYou recall that three hundred and sixty five days yore,\nthe spirits of Christmas and I visited you.'\n'Yes, vividly, and I will be forever grateful.'\n\"Tis Good. But, now we have had a little time to\nthink upon it... We were wondering... if you would...,'\nthe shade seemed momentarily lost for words, 'if you\nwould... return to your old ways.'\nScrooge was flabbergasted. 'My old ways!,' he\nexclaimed, 'Pah! Never! Never in a million years!'\nMarley shrugged his transparent shoulders. 'I was\nafraid this might happen, I knew they should have\nbeen more careful,' he mumbled and with an\nexpansive gesture and a rattle of ironmongery, he was\ngone.\nScrooge hid his head beneath his blankets. What\nwas to become of him? He mused. Why had Jacob\nchanged his ethereal mind? Why were the spirits so\ndamned inconsistent? Why? He lay back and slowly\nclosed his eyes, around him the room filled with a shimmering fog.\nHis eyes snapped open. A crowd had gathered at\nthe end of his bed. Scrooge looked from figure to\nfigure. Several of the apparitions had strangely familiar\nfaces. Two had no faces at all. There was a stirring\nand from the centre of the gathering stepped a large,\njovial man. He cleared his throat.\n'Remember us,' he said, 'Spirit of Christmas Present\nat your service. My acquaintances Past and Yet-ToCome, I believe you have already met.' He pointed to\ntwo of the shadows moving behind him. 'The Others?\nWell, the fellow with the blood stained axe and the\ndead virgin is the Spirit of Christmas Prehistoric. Poor\nsoul. He doesn't get out much these days. Oh, and\nthe little fellow with the hood, that's Yet-To-Come's younger brother, A Little-Bit-After-That.'\nOn cue, A Little-Bit slowly mano eu ve red his way\nthrough the assembled ghouls, then in a single\nsmooth, sudden motion he grabbed Scrooge by his\nbony wrists and dragged him through his own\nbedroom wall...\nScrooge fell and fell, his body turning and twisting\nas he felt the decades fly past. He screwed up his eyes\nin terror just before he landed with a thump on cold,\nhard ground.\nToo fearful to open his eyes, too terrified to breathe,\nEbeneezer Scrooge listened. He heard a screeching.\n'Jingle Bells, Jingle Bells, JJ J Jingle Bells\nJingle all the way\nOh what fun it is to ride\nIn a one-one-one horse open sleigh...'\nA nauseatingly cheerful voice interrupted 'and that\nwas Kylie and Jason in Stock, Aitken and Waterman's Jingle Bells-The Remix. Welcome to Safefare\nSupermarket during this, the last Christmas of 1989.\nPlease buy everything you can...'\nScrooge shook his head and reluctantly opened his\neyes. All around him he saw gold, shining streamers\nof gold, and, in among them, crowds of people,\nwandering aimlessly in all directions, their eyes blank\nand staring. Above him he saw, inscribed in letters\nhalf the height of a man, the words 'MERRY\nCHRISTMAS TO ALL OUR CUSTOMERS.'\nThere was a rustle and, from behind needle clad\nbows of one of a dozen dead pine trees, popped ALittle-Bit. He beckoned Scrooge towards him. From\nthe depths of his cowl he spoke, in a voice from the\nedge of time. ' 'Ere we are then, son. Christmas\nNineteen Hundred and Eighty Nine. This, me old mate,\nis what Christmas will become.'\nWith that, he grabbed Scrooge's wizened arm and\ndragged him into the lumbering mass of humanity.\nThey travelled swiftly, Scrooge had seldom more than\na glimpse of what was happening around him. But\nwhat a glimpse it was..\nHe saw scantily dressed young women, selling\nbottles of scent to balding, sweating middle aged\nmen. He saw children fighting over tiny mauve toy\nhorses. He saw a dozen fat white- bearded men, all\nclothed in red and all shouting 'Ho! Ho! Ho!'\nAnd the sounds, the shouted conversations: 'Your\nmother would hate it... It'll never last 'till New Year...\nI WANT a Barbie Doll.'\nScrooge stared blankly at the milling crowds. Never\nhad he seen so many people suffering together. This\nwas Christmas... Christmas...\nHe awoke with the daylight streaming in on him\nthrough the bedroom window. It was Christmas Day.\nIn the nearby houses, people were already awake,\ncelebrating the birth of Christ. Scrooge threw off his\nbedclothes and, storming to the window, slammed it\nopen. He took a deep breath, and at the top of his\nvoice bawled 'Christmas! HUMBUG!'.\nPage 17\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX investigates the semiconductor IRC at Imperial\nInterdisciplinary res ej It is a sort of Government ministerial mantra that\nindustry and academia should work more closely\ntogether and it was at least partially with this in mind\nthat the Interdisciplinary Research Centres (IRCsl\nwere formed. These are large, university- based\n'centres of excellence' where researchers from a wide\nrange of backgrounds can work together on\ncommercially viable projects. They will do no\nfundamental 'blue-sky s' research.\nThe Government hopes that these centres will be\nable to make more efficient use of the available public\nmoney and attract industrial sponsorship. Ministers\neven claim that the centres could become self\nsupporting.\nIn the two years since the IRCs were first mooted\nseventeen have been set up, three of them at Imperial\nCollege. IC's IRCs specialise in process control,\npopulation biology, and semiconductor materials.\nThey have even been deemed important enough to\nwarrant a visit from the Prime Minister. The largest\nof the three, and the oldest, is the IRC for\nSemiconductor Materials. Its director is Professor\nBruce Joyce.\nProfessor Joyce's group is based in Imperial's Physics and Chemistry departments although it\nincludes researchers working at University College,\nQueen Mary College and at what has been described\nas 'a small outpost' in Oxford. It has a budget of \u00a313\nmillion and a staff of around thirty academics.\nThe IRC proudly claims to be truly interdisciplinary\ninvolving physicists, chemists, material scientists and\nelectronic engineers in both theoretical and\nexperimental work. Their aim is to produce\ncommercially viable semiconductor devices a few\natoms wide, accurately and with the lowest possible\nlevel of impurities.\nSemiconductor materials such as Silicon |Si| and\nGallium Arsenide (GaAs) have been used for decades\nin everything from the simplest transistor to the most\ncomplicated 'silicon chip'. Semiconductor research is\nsell able and, the IRC hopes, an attractive investment.\nThe most important technique used by Professor\nJoyce's Group is Molecular Beam Epitaxy (MBE), a method for growing layers of material as little as one\natom in thickness on the surface of a slice of\nsemiconductor crystal. It relies for its effectiveness\non the volatility of single atoms of semiconductor.\nUnless tightly held in place, such as in a crystal\nlattice, these atoms can easily be dislodged. So when\nsuch an atom strikes the target it will normally\nrebound. It will only stick if it lands in exactly the right\nplace to form part of a crystal.\nIf there is a steady stream of atoms.hitting the\ntarget many will rebound but a few will stick and a layer of new material will slowly form. By changing\nthe source of atoms, layers of different materials can\nbe built up, one on top of another.\nIn reality MBE is much more complicated. The\nprocess can only work under very clean conditions at\nvery low pressures, so all the essential apparatus must\nbe contained within an ultra- high vacuum chamber.\nThe beams of atoms are produced by heating samples\nof material in small ovens and allowing atoms to\ndiffuse out. Under such low pressures, an individual\nPage 20\natom can easily travel the half metre or so from the\noven to the target without colliding with another\nparticle.\nUsually, a number of separate ovens are used, each\nproviding a beam of different material and with\nmechanical shutters to control the flow. In the midst\nof all this, the target is heated and steadily rotated to\nensure an even coating.\nAtoms which miss or rebound have to be caught.\nThis is achieved by cooling the walls of the chamber\nwith liquid nitrogen: at these temperatures, atoms\nwhich strike the walls stick.\nProducing a thin, even layer of atoms is a delicate\nbalancing act. A beam of electrons reflected off the\nsample's surface can be used to examine its structure\nand the temperatures of the ovens and the sample\nadjusted to give the best results. Typically, a single\nMBE machine costs between \u00a30.5 million and \u00a31\nmillion to build and can lay down material at a rate\nof one new atomic layer a second. The IRC\nresearchers plan to install two or three new MBE\nmachines.\nMuch IRC research will revolve around achieving the\nbest performance from MBE and the alternative gas-based Metallo Organic Chemical Vapour Deposition\n(MOCVD). The IRC staff will have a wide range of\ndetailed and sophisticated techniques at their disposal\nranging from high definition scanning tunnelling\nmicroscopy to computer modelling.\nIn a normal semiconductor most electrons are\ntightly bound to the atoms; however, due to impurities\nin the material or excess energy from the\nsurroundings, a few will always escape. If the\nsemiconductor is large enough, these can travel freely\nin all directions, allowing a current to flow. In effect,\nthe solid contains a three-dimensional 'gas' of\nelectrons.\nThis gas is not a perfect conductor: impurities and\nflaws in the crystal and atomic vibrations can deflect\nand slow the electrons. Devices made from impure\nsemiconductor are intrinsic ly slower than those made\nfrom purer material.\nMBE has enabled researchers to build slices of pure\nsemiconductor just a few atoms wide. Under these\nconditions the electrons are constrained to move in\na plane. This too is an electron gas, a two dimensional\nelectron gas (2DEG) with its own special properties.\nBy building a layer of a pure semiconductor on top\nof impure electron-rich material, it is possible to\nconfine the 2DEG to the cleaner region where the\nelectrons can move more freely. A2 DEG based\ndevice, such as the High Electron Mobility Transistor\n(HEMT), will respond faster than its simpler\ncounterpart but at a price. There is a limit on the\namount of excess energy the electrons can have and,\nas energy is heavily dependant on temperature, a maximum temperature beyond which the device will\nnot work. Practical HEMTs have a working\ntemperature near 4 Kelvin.\nSemiconductor sandwiches can be used to produce\nminiature tuned lasers. There is a comparatively large\ndifference between the energies of bound electrons\nch centres at IC\nstand those of the free electrons so when an electron\nis 'captured' energy will be released in the form of a photon. For a large slab of material, this energy\ndifference is fixed and, as the frequency of light is\nrelated to the photon energy, the released photons will\nhave a certain energy.\nAs the thickness of the slab decreases, a number\nof distinct discrete energy 'levels' form. Electrons\njumping between different levels can produce photons\nof different but constant frequencies. The slab will\nbecome a tuned laser almost too narrow to be seen\nby an electron microscope.\nUsing other techniques it is possible to further\nconstrict the electron gas to make the electrons flow\nrapidly along one dimensional 'Quantum Wires' or hold\nthem fixed in 'Quantum Dots' to build up complicated\nmulti-layered circuits on the scale of atoms.\nMost IRC research will have an eventual commercial\nend product but Professor Joyce does not believe that\nfinding applications is its primary aim. He argues that\nonly the sponsoring companies have the experience\nnecessary for this. He sees the IRC as collaborating\nwith rather than working for industry. Government\npressure to make the work more immediately\ncommercial will be strongly resisted.\nNo-one is claiming that the \u00a313 million provided will\nsupport all the IRC's work and the group will have to\nlook for other sources of funding. British Industry may\nhelp, the electronics company Phillips is already\ndonating an MBE machine. Some cash may come\nfrom the various European Community projects but\nthe area of most interest must be Japan.\nUnlike the UK, the Japanese have invested\nenormously in research in recent years. Everyone in\nJapan who can do research is already doing so and\ncompanies who want more work are looking outside.\nProfessor Joyce hopes that they will look to the IRC.\nThe Japanese may not need too much\nencouragement. In 1992, the much vaunted European\nsingle market will become an economic reality and it\nwill become more difficult for companies outside\nEurope to compete. Of course, if Japan becomes a major investor in British research, it will not be outside\nany more.\nThe concept of an IRC is only about two years old\nand it has already come in for some criticism. The\nrecent 'Flemming Report' was critical of the way the\ncentres were set up although, according to Professor\nJoyce, it was 'quite favourably disposed' to the IRCs\nthemselves. Nobel laureate Dennis Noble of the Save\nBritish Science campaign is openly hostile. He believes\nthat IRC research is over-controlled and that extending\nthe idea further could damage British Science.\nThe Semiconductor IRC is under a year old and has\nat least another three years before it is due to be\nassessed. If it survives the assessment it will receive\nGovernment funding for another four years but from\nthen on it will have to be self supporting or fade away.\nIt may not be until the mid 1990s that we finally\ndiscover whether or not the IRC experiment has been\na success.\nThis\nYfeek\n\u2022 The major industrialised countries will have to\nreduce carbon dioxide emissions by three-quarters by\nthe year 2030 according to a recent report. The\nreport, from the California-based International Project\nfor Sustainable Earth Paths, proposes a system of\ncarbon dioxide 'budgets'-limits on the amount of the\ngas which any one country is allowed to produce.\nThe researchers propose a global budget of 300\nbillion tonnes, split equally between industrialised and\ndeveloping countries. Each country will have a quota\nbased on its population. The scheme deliberately hits\nthe wealthier industrialised countries hard while\nallowing the developing world 25 years before it has\nto make serious reductions.\nIt is estimated that the industrialised nations will\nhave to reduce their emissions by 20% by 2005, 50%\nby 2015 and 75% by 2030. The figures assume that\nthe tropical rain forests can only survive an increase\nof 0.1 \u00b0C per decade, if the rise is any higher the\nforests, responsible for recycling and removing much\nof the World's carbon dioxide, will start to die out.\n\u2022 Like the infamous watched pot, a Quantum\nMechanical system will do absolutely nothing if\nexamined closely enough. This apparent\ncontradiction, known as the Quantum Zeno Paradox,\nhas been known of in theory for decades. Now\nresearchers at the National Institute of Standards and\nTechnology (NIST) in Boulder, Colorado claim to have\nexperimental evidence.\nThe NIST team examined several thousand beri lli um ions held in a magnetic trap and subjected them to\na256 millisecond burst of a radio frequency field. This\nshould have raised all the ions from their lowest\npossible energy to the second lowest. The number of\nions in the lower level was counted by subjecting them\nto a brief flash of precisely tuned la set light. This\nexcited all the atoms in the lowest state up into the\nthird lowest. This third energy level is very unstable\nand the ions rapidly release the extra energy as flashes\nof light. The number of lowest energy state ions could\nthen be found by simply counting the flashes.\nThe researchers found that if they looked only after\nthe full 256 ms, all the ions were at energy level 2.\nBut when they 'sneek ed agli mse' at 128 ms, then\nafter the full time only half the ions had made it to level\n2. The single look had effectively reset the system.\nIn classical physics the experiment and the\nexperimenter are completely seperate but in QM there\nis no such thing as an impartial observer.\n\u2022 An international team of geneticists have found\nthe defective gene that causes Hypertropic\nCardiomyopathy, the thickening of one wall of the\nheart. The team has also found an associated genetic\nmarker inherited with the gene which can be used to\nwarn potential sufferers.\n\u2022 Artifical seeding of clouds may account for up to\n15% of rainfall in the USSR, Soviet meteorologists\nhave claimed. Seeding, the technique of spraying\nclouds with a chemical reagent around which water\ncan condense, has been known about for years and\nthere are a number of current research programmes.\nSome experts are sceptical about the Soviet claims\nsaying that the increase could only be around 5%.\n\u2022 Job Offer. Anyone who fancies writing this column\nnext term should contact Dave Smedley at the FELIX\nOffice.\nPage 21\n\n"

Collins managed to reach\nthe stage where six were left, out of the original 4000\napplicants.\nDr Collins said that his near success in the mission\nwas probably because his area of research was in the\nspace industry and that he could speak some Russian.\n'Basically I'm well qualified', he said.\nHe added that the personality tests came to the\nconclusion that he was a 'stable extrovert with below\naverage tough-mindedness and emotional it y' and\napparently good at abstract and mechanical reasoning.\nHe said the fact that he was fit was helpful too.\nHe said he realised the mission was more of a public\nrelations exercise he added 'NASA's greatest success\nhas been to make space boring - Juno has made it\ninteresting'. He saw no reason why cosmonauts\nshu old n't be the target of high-finance advertising any\nmore than Boris Becker is.\nHe went on to say that a 'Juno Mission Control\nCentre' may be built in the near future next to the\nentrance to Mechanical Engineering on Exhibition\nroad.

This\nconfirms that he is well on the way towards winning\nthe 'Howgate - Harbourbridge Megaprize for\nUnashamed Self-Publicity 1989'(HHMUSP).\nThere were more important matters, generally\nrevolving around that hardy perennial of student\nmatters, money. Our beloved Union President, Neil\nMcCluskey, is going to expound and explain rents\nin the next Alternative Prospectus, with the\nexpectation that recruitment for the year who read\nit will plummet below the 20% drop that occured this\nyear. This will display the truth in the old add age that\ncrime doesnt pay - the truth will surely turn the\nUniversity of London into a fusty old corporation\nentirely devoted to milking Alumni to fund obscure\nresearch projects, removing the minor irritant of\nstudents altogether.\nThe great and good Big Mac also said that students\nliving in college ac como dati on cannot expect a fall\nin their rent when the poll tax (occasionally known\nas the 'Community Charge') is introduced. This is\nobviously because it would be sensible and ethical\nto do so. Unlike most establishments, Imperial doesn't pay rates, so cannot deduct rates from the rent. This\nmakes sense; though why rents in College\nac como dati on are so exorbitant even when rates are\nnot passed onto the tenants can only be explained with\na lot of arm waving and unintelligible statistics.\nThe Harlington Gravel saga continued with the\nannouncement that the proceeds of converting a nice\ngreen rugby pitch into a life- like representation of\nthe surface of the moon would probably be about \u00a31.6\nmillion. It was not said that this was because MetroGoldwyn-Mayer had bought it to film a remake of\nJules Verne's 'From the Earth to the Moon'.\nNext year's president, Mr Paul Shanley,\nHHMUSP, forwarded a motion in which all ICU\npolicy that is more than three years old should be\nabandoned, and motions that need to live any longer\nshould be r escu c it a ted at three year intervals at UGMs\nin the normal way. The great and good ICU president\nwas instructed to list all the motions that would be\nexecuted in this way. As the resulting list would make\neven a hardened Nazi jew-killer feel faint due to its\nlength, the Big Mac consented on the condition he\nwouldn't have to do it. Which seems rather strange\nreally.\nA vote was taken to decide whether a paper ballot\nshould be held on the subject whether there should\nbe a two-thirds majority of voting students ac cee ding to affiliation to the NUS before affiliation becomes\na bye-law as a two-thirds majority is needed for\nd is affiliation and as a two-thirds majority is virtually\nimpossible to obtain at aUG M this would make it\nimpossible to join the NUS, or to leave it if already\njoined. Or something like that. The paper ballot failed\nto give the two-thirds majority needed to allow to\nmake the change to the union bye-law so that the vote\non affiliation needed a two-thirds majority to be\npassed. The idea behind these extraordinary\ncontortions is that if the bye-law was changed (so a two-thirds majority is needed to join the NUS, not\nthe simple 51 % as presently needed) it would become\nmuch more difficult to join the NUS. As it now stands,\nat the next vote for NUS affiliation, it only takes 51 %\nof voters to hand over IC Union's cherished\nindependence to the NUS. That the paper ballot failed\nwas not particularly surprising, as it had already been\nsaid that it was virtually impossible to obtain a two-thirds majority at aUG M. Ours is not to reason why.\nJolly old loans, that whoop y do initiative from our\nwise and beloved overlords, caused a number of\nmotions. The most unusual was probably the one in\nwhich Neil McCluskey appeared to throw in the\ntowel, along with the Felix editor, Dave Smedley.\nThere were piteous cries and tearing of hair amongst\nthe assembled children, which apparently were piteous\nenough to melt their stony resolve, and amidst\njubilation and reconciliation the two custodians of our\nbank balances admitted that they had only done\nbecause they were sulking.\nAn attack of righteous indignation fuelled the\nmotion in which all icons to the pagan god 'Natwest',\nthe son of Mammon according to ancient mythology,\nwere to be removed from the temple. This was\nprophesied by the scriptures in which it said 'and so\nit shall come to pass that the Guardians of Pelf,\nNatwest and all his brothers will be consumed by their\nparent Mammon. And the scurrying masses of\nstudents will call on their champion Nemesis to calm\ntheir teeth-grinding indignation. And Nemesis will\nhave no bloody effect at all so the scurrying masses\nwho are held in thrall to Natwest and his brothers will\nrun away to other countries'.\nA close second to Paul Shanley in the self-publicity\nstakes, Doug King, thought it would be a jolly good\nidea to cover up the adverts for the unmentionable\nbank on the back of our Union cards with a' Viz' sticker. I am so stunned by the scale and grandeur\nof this silliness I cannot s at i rise it further.\nPage 4\n\n"

In\norder to explain and justify actions that have taken\nplace and to prevent similar problems occur ing in the\nfuture, you must have more information from us about\nMary's and you should communicate this information\nto the student body through FELIX.\nInformation\nThe Medical School is very conscious of its role within\nthe hospital and always bears in mind the image it\nportrays to the general public. Concern for this image\nis exhibited by staff and students, particularly clinical\nstudents who are an integral part of the health care\nsystem. Being part of a team is therefore important\nto patient welfare, and the attitude of the students\nis one of being part of the institution, as opposed to\nworking against it. This attitude continues beyond the\nconfines of the ward and, in issues concerning the\npublic image of the Medical School, the Union and the\nMedical School administration work together.\nApplying this to the events surrounding FELIX issue\n850, displaying pornographic material in a hospital\nenvironment would have caused public offence, and\nwould have damaged the relationship between St\nMary's and the community that it serves. We\ntherefore fully support the Dean's efforts in trying to\nuphold public respect for the Medical School.\nCommunication\nClearly many things are done differently in Paddington\nas opposed to South Kensington we should not miss\nthe opportunity to inform people about how St Mary's is run, and what it is doing. We talked some time ago\nabout having a regular contribution to FELIX from St\nMary's. We feel that this would do much to prevent\nproblems occurring in the future. Also, by having\nsomething relevant to Mary's life in FELIX, more\npeople at Paddington would start reading the\npublication. This would help people at St Mary's to\nstart to understand the way of life at South\nKensington.\nWith best wishes,\nRhydian Hapgood, President SMHMS SU.\nAndrew Klava, Vice President lEx t). Simon Smith, Vice President (Int).\nUp yours\nAlumnus\nOffice\nDear Dave,\nDo you think that the 'Welcome Back' Alumnus\nposter is supposed to look like a two fingered salute\nfrom a distance?\nYours sincerely,\nRalph Greenwell.\nPage 30\nDear FELIX,\nAs I am not a member of IC Christian Union, I cannot\nargue from exactly their standpoint, but as a Christian,\ni feel sure they will agree with at least some of what\nI have to say.\nIt seems to me that Rupert Sheldon (the 'Satanist'\nFELIX 1st Dec) is the one that does not understand\nwhat sex or sexuality is. I believe that since God\ncreated us all, our sexuality is an integral part of our\neveryday lives, and no one can really live without it.\nHowever, I am talking about sex as an expression\nof love and affection, and not the act of sexual\nintercourse. Sexual intercourse is a 'uniting of flesh',\nand as such should only be indulged in when the two\npeople concerned are totally committed to each other,\nie, have taken the vows of marriage. Sexual\nintercourse outside of marriage can be a very\ndamaging experience emotionally, aside from the risks\nof pregnancy, STDs etc.\nAs for God not loving him because he doesn't know\nGod, try this example: if a rich Japanese businessman\n(whom Rupert had never seen before l decided that he\nwould pay off every IC student's bank overdraft,\nwould that not be a sign of the businessman's love\nand care for IC students, even though none of us\nknew him? I think the parallels are obvious.\n'Men and women concerned about their personal\nrights should stand up and say' YES to God's forgiveness, and His promise of eternal life, by\nadmitting their mistakes and turning to Christ.\nYours sincerely,\nNeil Dinmore, Mech Eng 2.\nPS. My opinion on the 'offending' issue of FELIX,\nis that the article was very good, but that the pictures\non the cover were completely unnecessary.\nFisher's fucking\nfreezing\nDear Sweetie-pie,\nHow's things with you? 'Cos it's bloody freezing\ndown here in flat 18 Fisher Hall. Regarding the articles\nin last week's FELIX on living standards in the\nsalubrious residences of Evelyn Gardens! Having\novercome the initial problem of entering the flat,\nfighting our way through a jungle of rubbish, (which\nwas eventually removed after complaining for several\ndays), the fun begins:- .\nThe one and only .j di at or does not work, leaving\nthe whole flat to be heated, by two mini convection\nheaters situated so high up that levitation seems to\nbe the only answer!\nMeals cooked in open pans on the cooker hobs have\nthe occasional added ingredient of plaster falling from\nthe hole in the ceiling above the cooker. Fortunately\nthe shower water that also .fell from the\naforementioned hole has ceased; a result of the\nshower above being locked, not fixed, thus limiting\nthe number of showers in operation even further for\nthe residents of Fisher Hall.\nThe fan, the only possible source of ventilation in\nthe bathroom, has been broken since we arrived,\ncontravening health laws.\nLikewise, fire regulations are not being enforced, as\nthe fire alarm failing to operate during a fire test at\nleast four weeks ago is still out of order.\nWe have repeatedly complained about each\nproblem as it occurred; which in each case was at\nleast three weeks ago. We have been informed by the\nsub-wardens that these faults have been reported to\nhouse 44, but nothing has been repaired.\nYours shivering ly, The occupants of flat 18 Fisher Hall.\nPS. Many thanks to the workmen, who, today did\nnothing, but left a wooden ladder suitable for\nfirewood-we considered burning it to gain warmth,\nbut realised that this was potentially dangerous,\nespecially since the fire alarm does not work.\nApathy\nrules OK?\nDear Dave\nI am writing this letter sitting in Tuesday's Council\non which I am an Ordinary member as elected at a UGM last year. It is the middle of Neil McCluskey's report. It seems to me that Neil, amongst other\nofficers, is getting pissed off with the attitude of the\nnormal IC student.\nBy writing this letter I am pre-empting the UGM on\nThursday. I think that the UGM will be not be quo rate, and even if it is, it will only be because of a contentious motion. Perhaps to get people to attend,\na UGM might have to decide on its future in each\nUGM?\nAs you are a student you are entitled to join any ICU\nclub or society. Most of these clubs rely on other\nofficers of the Union to promote their interests. It is\ntherefore in the interest of any club or society member\nto turn up at UGMs and question the officers and\nsabbaticals. Even if you are not a club or society\nmember, the Union is acting on your behalf when\nrepresenting you to College and external bodies. The\nfact that you are reading this letter means you have\na FELIX and are therefore using some ICU facility.\nIt is about time that some of the ordinary students\nof IC bothered to get interested, to show up at UGMs\nand to ask their representatives what is going on.\nWithout the officers of the Union, and therefore\nwithout your representation, clubs, societies, bars,\nbookshops etc. your time as a student at IC will be\ncrap to say the least.\nEither turn up, get interested or let apathy rule IC\nand lose your club and your rights.\nYours,\nJoe Fernley\nElec Eng 2\n\n"

    "content": "'I don't sing them I destroy them!' is what Jalacy\nHawkins said of his stage performances. He started\nout in 1953, singing ballads and blues in a small way\nuntil he hit the headlines in '56 with / Put a Spell on\nYou, the song that made him famous as Screamin'\nJay Hawkins. He grunts, screams and bubbles his way\nthrough this heavily rhythmic, nec romantic track. The\nwords, sung in a gravelly baritone, are all about\nthreatening his girl with voodoo spells to prevent her\nleaving him. The song created an uproar at the time\nand was kept off the charts, despite sales of over a million copies.\nThe following years showed a drift towards highly\ntheatrical horror rock and songs such as Alligator Wine\nand Frenzy. The stage acts became increasingly\nanimated with coffins and halloween-style rubber\nspiders and snakes, garish and fake, strewed all over\nthe stage, and a pet skull called Henry who smoked\nHusker Du were a widely acclaimed American noise\nband and Bob Mould used to play electric guitar with\nHusker Du . He's begun his first tour of Britain as a solo act-he's all on his own apart from the backing\nband.\nMould arrives on stage to confront a slightly\nbemused audience who are ty ring to come to terms\nwith a strange set from the support band. Said\nsupport, House of Freaks seemed to have lost some\nof their members on the way to the gig being bereft\nof everything except a singer who owned a guitar and\na drummer. These two contrived to perform for over\nhalf an hour leaving no impression other than\nconfusion.\nAt first sight Bob Mould certainly doesn't look as\nthough he will reassure the audience, he looks even\nmore awkward than they do. He plays guitar like a man being electrocuted by a fly mo, spasmodically\ncigars and set off sheets of flame from pieces of flash-paper in the Screamer's palm.\nWith the sixties came hard times, and Hawkins\nspent the best part of fifteen years out in the\nwilderness before re-emerging in a film in 78 which\nset him off on a tour of America, Australia and Europe,\nwith performances only marginally more restrained\nthan in the past. 1979 and '83 saw two new albums.\nScreamin' the Blues was a smooth collection of old\nsongs, and Real Life showed characteristically original\nlyrics with a return to blues ballads in a gentler, almost\nnost ali gic style betraying some hints of age and\nreason.\nThe more recent years have seen Jay Hawkins\ninvolved with director Jim Jarmusch. Stranger than\nParadise, Jarmusch's bleakly funny tale of wandering\nHungarian immigrants looking for paradise in America\nfeatures / Put a Spell on You as the title song. Tom\njerking this way and that. However, the material itself\nshows a remarkable breadth of vision. It is rather like\nwatching an artist splashing paint on a canvas in an\napparently haphazard manner, yet managing to create\na rich and coherent whole.\nThere are rough edges: some of the songs aren't quite there, they either harp on a particular riff for too\nlong or, alternatively, seem to have little structure. All\nthe same, the main impression is one of highly\ncharged creativity which builds towards a climax that\nis Whichever Way the Wind Blows the searing last\nsong of the main set. We think the concert is over as\nMould lies on his back at the end of this song, a cascade of feedback reverberating around him. But\nno! After the smoke has cleared he returns to play a short, but very sweet, acoustic set. Again the\naudience is confused.\nJoseph Andrews.\nWaits' similar whiskey-soaked voice provided the\nmusic for Down By Law, the next Jarmusch film, but\nHawkins returns in Mystery Train, the third major\nJarmusch film, which opened in London in November.\nThe soundtrack is again due to Tom Waits, and\nHawkins plays the receptionist of a seedy hotel in\nMemphis where two young Japanese tourists in\nsearch of paradise and a good time are shipwrecked.\nScreamin' Jay is now touring with the full weight\nof his sixty years behind him. He was at the Town &\nCountry Club on Halloween (photo), with the usual\nmechanical spiders crawling around on his piano, the\nskull Henry producing clouds of smoke and flashes of\nflame and ear-splitting shrieks rending the air around\nhis spellbound audience. He will probably be back:\ndon't miss him.\nJames Connolly.\nXmas mix\nThose wacky people at Food Recordings have decided\nto give us all a really zany Xmas present this year. Not\na Jive Bunny mega mix of the labels premier hit singles\nbut three bands covering each other.\nSo we get current media darlings Jesus Jones\ntaking the axe to the Crazyhead song / Don't Want\nThat Kind of Love with surprisingly sophisticated\nresults. Jones is obviously starting to take this music\nbusiness thing a little bit seriously. Crazyhead get the\nchance to do a real demolition job on the Diesel Park\nWest track Like Princes Do. It works so well they\nshould consider adopting it in their live set. Diesel Park\nWest meanwhile can only prettify the classic Jesus\nJones single Info Freako and in doing so they lose its\nbrutal sarcastic wit which provides the only\ndisappointment of this festive free for all.\nCDL.\nPage 9\nBob Mould\n\n"

So every time I send a letter I get sweet FA. I get the strong feeling that it would get binned\nanyway. As for the people on Council who are feeling\nso righteous about writing their letters-wouldn't it\nhave been more personal if you had written your own\nletter instead of copying Joe Fernley's letter word for\nword?\nI agree with the sentiment of changing bank\naccounts as well.

Admit it, the banks are bound to\nconspire with the Government w lien they are being\noffered \u00a312 a time to ad minster overdrafts which they\nalready run. The hope of defeating the bill is failing\nas people realise that a one line bill cannot be easily\namended.

The\nlast time that such regulatory legislation was thrown\nout was in 1968, when the House of Lords caused\nsuch a fur ore they have not dared to repeat the action\nsince.

    "content": "The Rose\nand the\nGlad Rag Dolls\nThe (theatre) is a newly formed touring company\ncommitted to 'exploring the fantastic in literature'.\nTheir production of an adaptation of Thackeray's The\nRose and the Ring was a stylish debut.\nBest described as an adult fairy tale, The Rose and\nthe Ring centres on two imaginary kingdoms, where\ntwo evil kings, Valoroso and Padella, have usurped the\nthrones from their rightful owners, Giglio and Rosalba.\nRosalba, a destitute waif, turns up at Valoroso's court\nand becomes a chambermaid to Angelica, Valoroso's spoilt daughter who is adored by all. All is smooth until\nthe arrival of Padella's son, Bulbo to woo Angelica.\nThen the magic ring and the magic rose, which make\ntheir bearers ir resist able, fall into others' hands...\nNeedless to say everything comes right in the end.\nGiglio and Rosalba gain their kingdoms and the\nspoilt Angelica and Bulbo learn valuable lessons in\nhumility. But this is not a morality play. The (theatre)\napproach the play robustly. In a banquet scene, we\nsee the cast miming the advancing drunken ess of the\ncourt. In Giglio's speech to the troops who have come\nto drag him away, he apes Shakespeare and Churchill\nto win them onto his side.\nThe cast are uniform ally strong and have a good\nsense of comic timing. Billie Reynolds is especially\ngood as the horrendous Countess Gruffanuff, who\ntricks Giglio into agreeing to marry her, aided by a great deal of strategic padding. Allie Burns as the Fairy\nBlackstick carries out the difficult job of maintaining\nthe thread of the story.\nDuncan Watt's set is elegant and sparse (and needs\nto be in the confined spaces of this theatre) and is\nused to good effect, three pieces of furniture\nmasquerading in a multiplicity of roles. The costumes\nalso complement the style of the production in their\nsimplicity. While it is apparent that this show has been\nmounted on a limited budget, this seems to have\nspurred the inventiveness of the design and is a source\nof pleasure rather than dismay.\nThe Rose and the Ring is suitable for children, but\nwould be wasted on them: the satire and sublet y of\nmany of the lines will entertain even the most\nembittered adult. If you're sad that you can't go along\nand boo and hiss at a traditional pantomime, then go\nand see this play, a real Christmas treat.\nThe Rose and the Ring is on at the Latchmere\nTheatre until 23rd December at 8pm Monday to\nSaturday. The Latchmere Theatre is on the corner of\nLatchmere Road and Battersea Park Road and can be\nreached by Clapham Junction BR or buses 44 or 170\nfrom Vauxhall tube. Tickets cost \u00a34.50, plus \u00a31\nmembership of the theatre club (although they have\nreciprocal membership with other fringe theatres).\nLiz W. Page 8\nOpening the programme for this production, by\nRobideez and transferred from the Edinburgh festival,\nis a frightening experience. Over twenty songs in one\nplay? Are they actually going to have time to say\nanything? Thankfully, they do. The musical interludes\nare short, but well integrated into the structure of the\nplay. The mixture of old pieces, and specially\ncomposed pieces works, and help enhance the\natmosphere.\nThe cast of three make good use of the limited\nspace available, tricking our imagination into seeing\nanything from a flat in soho to a seedy nightclub\nstage.\nAgainst this backdrop a story involving a transvestite, and tr an sexual, and a bag lady unfolds.\nWe learn of their past and future. Two have risen from\nthe gutter, one has fallen into it.\nThe unusual nature of the characters is handled\nwell. They never come across as stereotypes, except\nwhen they are mocking themselves. The spoken\ndialogue is naturalistic, and the scenes in which\ncharacters, unseen and unheard, converse with the\nactors are surprisingly effective. Remarkably, the play\nis never judgemental, but merely presents us with a situation, and lets us judge. It is rare to be both\nentertained and left thinking by a play.\nThe end of the play is optimistic, without being a corny 'happy ending'. Well worth a visit.\nGlad Rag Dolls is playing at The Man in the Moon\ntheatre club on the Kings Road, about 20 minutes to\nhalf an hours walk from College and runs until\nDecember 23. A concessionary ticket is \u00a34.\nAdam T.A note about theatre clubs\nThere are many theatre clubs in London, which\nface an uncertain future, as the laws relating to\nthem are ambiguous. To see a play in one you\nmust be a member, and membership may have to\nbe taken out sometime in advance in some cases.\nCheck with the theatre in question. The Bush\n(FELIX Issue 851) is also a theatre club.\nThe Snow Queen\nAhh, Christmas. The pan to season is on us once more.\nThe pantomime dance, the principle boy, the ugly\nsisters, that's what you expect isn't it? Not in this one.\nThe Snow Queen has an all-female cast and crew,\nand only two, briefly appearing, male characters. This\npan to has always been female dominated, and it has\nonly taken a minor bit of tweaking to make it\ncompletely female. The dame (Bryony Lavery) is now\na somewhat bol shi e actress who complains about 'the\nmanagement' and discusses her motivation playing a rose. Believe me, it's funnier than it sounds. Indeed,\nthe entire play is done firmly tongue-in-cheek and is\nclearly target ted towards the adult audience. This is\nmade abundantly obvious by the lesbian theme that\nthreads its way through the play. Gerda goes to\nsearch for Kay because of her 'love' for her. The Snow\nQueen's reward is a kiss. Even the robber girl wants\nto 'play' and 'sleep' with Gerda. It's never overt,\nthough, and will only offend the most fanatical\nhomo ph obe. The stage design is effective, and mixes well with\nthe lighting, which transforms it from a snowy waste,\nto a riverside garden. There is a sprinkling of music\nwhich adds little to the play. Nicola Kathrens (Gerda)\ndoes a fine job of prot raying the mannerisms of a young girl, and Sarah Kerney is splendidly evil as Wolf,\neclipsing even the Snow Queen (Donna Champion)\nherself. The simultaneous dialogue of the\ngrandmothers is beautifully executed and very funny,\nas is the dame's Scandinavian accent as the Reindeer.\nThere are one or two throwaway political lines, but\nthankfully no male bashing.\nDefinitely one of the better Christmas shows, from\nwhich the lesbian overtones fit naturally, and one\nwhich is well worth a visit.\nYou can see The Snow Queen at the Drill Hall Arts\nCentre, 16 Chenie St, WC1. Performances Tue-Sat\nat 8pm. It runs until Jan 6 and a concessionary ticket\ncosts \u00a34.\nAdam T. "
