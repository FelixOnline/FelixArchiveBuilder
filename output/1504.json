    "content": "TECHNOLOGY\nTips & Hacks\nTechnology Editors: Chris Bowers\nFeroz Salam\ntechnology.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nAMD pulls out of \u2018two-horse race\u2019\nSchool ICT to finally be revamped\nLost focus? Try the Lytro\nHave you ever taken a picture, only to be disappointed when you later find it to be out of\nfocus? You\u2019re certainly not alone. Enter Lytro,\nthe world\u2019s first consumer-targeted light-field\ncamera.\nSo what does that mean? In your everyday\ncamera, what the sensor captures when you\npress the button is what you\u2019re stuck with. It\ndoesn\u2019t matter how many millions of pixels\nyou can capture at once if the light information you gather results in a blurry image. The\nlight-field technology used in the Lytro takes\na completely different approach to avoid this.\nInstead of focusing on a point and capturing\nthe light information for that perspective, the\ncamera captures up to 11 million rays of light\ngoing in every direction.\nThe main (and cool) advantage of this? You\nget to focus and refocus your photos after\nthey\u2019ve been taken. Not only that, but there\u2019s\nno auto-focus motor working in the time between you pressing the button and the picture\nbeing taken. That results in the picture you end\nup with being much closer to the one that you\nsaw with your eyes when you pressed the button \u2013 essential for fast moving objects and the\nlike.\nSo what about the actual camera itself? It\u2019s\nsurprisingly small \u2013 a cuboid-shaped device\njust over 11cm long and 4cm wide and high.\nWith that you get a small (3.3cm) touchscreen,\nshutter and power buttons, either 8 or 16GB\nof storage and a very decent 8x optical zoom.\nIt\u2019s light too, weighing in at just over 200g,\nbut it\u2019s strong aluminium shell means that it\ndoesn\u2019t have to skimp on durability to achieve\nthat figure.\nThe pictures come in at about 20-25MB each,\nand Lytro quote that the 8GB models (\u201cGraphite\u201d and \u201cElectric Blue\u201d) will hold about 350\npictures, with the 16GB model (\u201cRed Hot\u201d)\nholding up to 750. The different models are\npriced at $399 and $499 respectively, which\nisn\u2019t cheap, but isn\u2019t too expensive either when\nyou consider how new this technology is.\nIf you often find you\u2019ve missed out on\ncapturing those unmissable moments due to\nshoddy focusing, or perhaps you like to take\npictures of fast-moving objects, then the Lytro\nmay be the camera for you. Even if you don\u2019t\nbuy this camera, I reckon we\u2019ll be seeing a lot\nmore of this technology in the years to come.\nA company spokesman for AMD recently stated that\nthe company is going to \u201clet go of the old \u2018AMD versus Intel\u2019 mindset\u201d, a rivalry that has been ongoing for decades. It\u2019s hardly surprising that they\u2019ve\ndecided on a shift in strategy, as they just haven\u2019t\nbeen able to compete in the last few years. Even\nthe latest Bulldozer chips \u2013 which were meant to\nbe the pinnacle of desktop power \u2013 flopped. Meanwhile, Intel are going from strength to strength, with\ntheir Sandy Bridge line trouncing anything and everything that gets in the way. So what can we expect\nfrom AMD in the coming years? They have never expressed interest in building chips for smartphones\nand other handhelds before \u2013 and that\u2019s a market\nalready dominated by ARM. But they could have\nsomething in their sleeve. Or perhaps they\u2019re looking at the emerging ultrabook market: one without a\nclear chip leader. Only time will tell, but with nothing\nto lose, it was probably the right decision for them.\nA major initiative has been launched to drag Britain\u2019s\ncomputer science curriculum into the 21st century,\nwith one major goal being the reform of an ICT curriculum that has aged considerably since its introduction in the 90s. The Next Gen Skills campaign,\nwhich was coincidentally launched just before the\nrelease of a government report on the state of the\nnational IT education system, aims to modernise a\nsyllabus which at the moment focuses heavily on\nusing software rather than making it. There does\nappear to be some confusion over what constitutes\n\u2018computer science\u2019 and \u2018ICT\u2019, perhaps emblematic\nof the dire need for a revision of some sort. With the\ngovernment agreeing on the need for intervention,\nthe only question is whether and where funding is to\nbe found for it. The hope is that the new curriculum\nwill focus on creative coding rather than repetitious\nExcel tasks; creating inventive programmers (think\nMinecraft) rather than earnest number-crunchers.\nThe revision is merely in its first steps at the mo-ment, but the coming year should see some clearer\ndetails emerge on the nature of the changes to be\nmade. Hopefully, the legacy of the BBC Micro can be\nrepeated in a modern context; it\u2019s the only thing that\nwill keep Britain competitive in an hugely technology\ndependent world.\nFELIX\n10 Friday 02 december 2011\nChris Bowers\nI expect most of you have noticed the new\nitems that have started appearing in your Facebook feeds: Spotify playlists of music that your\nfriends are listening to, and news articles from\na whole host of national and international pa-pers. They are part of the \u2018OpenGraph\u2019scheme\nthat Facebook has been pushing in earnest over\nthe last few months: adding a few tags to your\nwebsite means that any links to your website\nfrom within Facebook makes it a Facebook\npage.\nFacebook\u2019s been selling this feature hard: it\ndescribes the feature as enabling you to \u2018integrate your Web pages into the social graph\u2019,\nwhatever that means. Yet how much control\ndoes the average user have on articles that appear in your profile, and how intrusive is the\nnew service? As anyone trying to use any of\nthe new links will have noticed, you can\u2019t click\non news articles on Facebook without signing\nup for \u2018a new social reading experience\u2019. Before agreeing to use the service you can choose\nwhich of your friends get to see what articles\nyou read, a feature which I suspect few people\nare using. On getting through to the article,\nyou are delivered to a Facebook themed version of the news website, with an option to\nvisit the actual website if you wish.\nIt\u2019s all fairly straightfoward and has been\nembraced with some enthusiasm by downturn-stricken publishers as a way of driving hits and\nadvertising revenue. Yet despite the new me-dia/social media feeding frenzy, of how much\nbenefit is this to the average user? The new interface adds nothing of value to the reader, unless you find comfort in reading reams of PR\nwaffle about the power of social sharing. The\nbiggest change that you have probably noticed\nis that your feed is now cluttered with the titles\nof articles your friends have read. If you have\nanywhere near the average number of friends,\nthe articles are bound to be from a wide selection and not really catered to anything you\nare interested in. As far as new and interesting reading material goes, I\u2019ve seen little. The\nsame applies to Spotify in my opinion. I don\u2019t\nmake friends solely on the basic of music taste,\nand in many cases would rather not know\nabout what my friends have been listening to.\nOne might argue that the responsibility of\nchoosing which feeds end up in your timeline\nlies with your friends, as they are in control\nof what you see after all. Yet I would have to\ndisagree - the sharing system in Facebook is\nvery cleverly organised to make limiting sharing a few orders of difficulty more complex\nto organise than expanding sharing. In a system geared towards drastically increasing the\namount of information you push out to the\nworld, it\u2019s not surprising we\u2019re hit with much\nmore than we can possibly care about.\nIt wouldn\u2019t be wise to underestimate the way\nmedia sharing has changed our communica-tion. Yet sharing is only effective when it is\norganic, not when it is forced. Whole hordes\nof PR representatives shouting about the value\nof \u2018next generation creative synergy\u2019 will not\nget me to read an article about something that\ndoesn\u2019t interest me, no matter how hard they\npush it into my feed.\nSocial media is in essence about finding information that interests you that you wouldn\u2019t\nhave found before, but it doesn\u2019t mean that\ninformation can be thrown at you from every context. When I log onto Facebook, it is\nto share things with all my friends, a diverse\nbunch of people from different countries, with\ndiverse political and cultural tastes. Shoehorning views that are of no interest to them into\nmy feed doesn\u2019t interest me. Sharing has been\ngreat, but as with everything, the point of \u2018too\nmuch\u2019 has been reached.\nFeroz Salam\nFacebook: all shared out?\n\n"

Thousands\nhave taken to the streets, forcibly occupying major landmarks in protest against\nfinancial injustices inflicted on them by\nthe capitalist system. But amidst all of the\nruckus, hidden deep in the background, is\nthe persistent call for help of a people who\nare so often forgotten and largely ignored\nby the mass media of the Western World. I\nam talking about the atrocious statistic reporting the 92% of young Tanzanians who\ncannot afford to pay for secondary school.\nWhile the noisy protest aims of the \u201coccupy\u201d group are often sympathised with\nby Westerners, the silent cry of millions\nof Tanzanians who are denied an essential\nhuman right often falls upon deaf ears. It\nis to change this gruelling reality that a\ngroup of Imperial students has chosen to\nspeak out and take concrete action. Rather\nthan forcibly occupying town squares and\npointing fingers at potential culprits, we\nhave decided to adopt a different approach by reaching out to local businesses in search for potential fundraising\nopportunities. The target of all our efforts\nis an inspirational education establishment in north eastern Tanzania, called the\nTEKUA project.\nTEKUA is an acronym that stands for\nthe five Swahili words: empowerment,\neducation, initiative, health and poverty.\nThe centre effectively uses education as\na weapon to break the crippling chain of\npoverty which reduces the lives of many\nyoung Tanzanian\u2019s to a mere fight for sur-vival. With education comes the empowerment of women in a society whose patriarchal traditions contribute emphatically\nto the spreading of HIV/AIDS. With edu-cation, the centre takes a concrete stand\nagainst poverty by equipping the youths\nof Tanzania with the skills necessary to\nfind decent jobs. Most importantly, with\neducation comes the possibility for young\nstudents to realise their dreams and make\npositive contributions to the development\nof their society. These are goals worth\nfighting for. These are statistics worth\nprotesting against. There are 92% of Tanzanians who deserve a voice in our world,\nand we are determined to finally give them\none.\nNow how do we Imperial students fit\ninto this context and how can we actually make a difference to the lives of these\nyoung Tanzanians? The answer is by doing\nenough work to make the TEKUA centre\nfinancially self-sufficient. Unfortunately\nthis is much easier said than done. It would\nbe far easier to ask people for their spare\nchange on street corners and donate all\nthe proceeds to the centre. This approach\nhowever, would make the centre entirely\nreliant on the generosity of foreigners, thus\npreventing it from growing and flourishing\nindependently.

    "content": "POLITICS\nFELIX 11\nFRIDAY 02 december 2011\nLooking at The Bottom Billion\nA review of the book and a glance at the main problem in international development\nRory Fenton\nPolitics Editors: Rajat Jain\nJoseph Letts\nThe world of international development is more often than not more\ncomplex than the image the rock concerts and heart-strings-tugging TV\nads might project. Often riddled with\nscandalous corruption and heated\ndebate, a heavy dose of evidence is\nclearly needed. Oxford Professor Paul\nCollier aims to provide just this in his\n2007 book The Bottom Billion. Billed\nas an explanation as to \u2018Why the poorest countries are failing and what can\nbe done about it\u2019, the book injects a\ngenerous helping of evidence and statistical analysis in the aid debate, like\nsmashing LSE and Imperial together\nin a particle accelerator.\nA real strength of this book is that it\nmanages to be utterly devoid of ideol-ogy. It doesn\u2019t even argue that fighting poverty is a moral issue, rather\npointing out that the practical benefits more than pay for themselves.\nThis absence of ideology is achieved\nthrough a technique after my own\nscientific heart: statistical evidence.\nDebate around development tends to\nbe focussed on \u2018poverty traps\u2019. The\nLeft believe that being poor to start\nwith keeps you poor; you can\u2019t afford\nanti-malaria medicine so you get sick\nwhich means you can\u2019t work which\nkeeps you poor which means you\ncan\u2019t afford the malaria medicine next\ntime either. All the poor need, say the\nLeft, is one Big Push to get them onto\ntheir feet, to buy medicine for them, to\neducate their children etc. The Right,\non the other hand, deny the very existence of such traps with all the passion\nof Dawkins and his New Atheists. It is\naid, they say, which keeps people poor\nby making them dependent on handouts and putting money in the hands\nof unpleasant politicians.\nCollier, on the other hand, sits betwixt these positions, shaking his\nscarily educated head. Just look at\nthe evidence, he implores. The Bottom Billion is just that; the evidence.\nAnd having been head of development\nresearch at the World Bank and now\ndirector of the Centre for the Study\nof African Economies at Oxford, he\u2019s\naccrued quite a bit of evidence in\nhis time, all of which has led him to\nbelieve that yes there are some poverty traps. But they come in different\nforms and may be affecting a given\ncountry in different ways. These traps\nare: conflict, natural resources, being\nlandlocked and poor governance.\nIt\u2019s pretty obvious that a country in\nthe midst of a civil war is not going\nto develop very well economically but\nwhat Collier does is to quantify this\ntruism. From the stats, a given failing\nstate has about a 14% chance of civil\nwar within a 5 year period. He finds\nthat each percentage point knocks a\npercentage point off that risk. So a\npoor country growing at 2% will have\nthe risk of civil war reduced to 12%\nwhereas a country declining at 2%\neach year will have the risk increase to\n16%. Of course, you might think that\nthe prospect of peace leads to greater\nspending and so peace causes growth\nand not the other way around, but\neven when growth is caused by a rain\nshock (a flood, drought of very good\nrainy season), the same effect is found\non the risk of conflict.\nThis might be hard for many to ac-cept, as it is tempting to believe that\nrebels are fighting for some kind of\ncause, not simply because of a low\ngrowth rate, and besides, isn\u2019t much\nof Africa\u2019s civil strife simply a result\nof the horrors of colonialism? But\nwhen Collier compared countries with\nvarying levels of economic inequality\nand oppression of minorities as well\nas whether or not they had been colo-nised, he could find no clear evidence\nthat these made countries any more\nconflict prone.\nOther than the human misery caused\nby civil war, the impact is economically devastating. Collier puts the\neconomic damage due to civil war at\n$64bn to both the country itself and its\nneighbours. Given that two civil wars\non average start every year, that\u2019s\nabout $100bn lost \u2013 more than the entire global aid budget.\nSo the poorer a country is, the more\nlikely it is the fall into the very conflict that keeps it poor.\nNatural resources should be an easy\nroute out of poverty and yet some of\nthe world\u2019s poorest countries have an\nabundance of the stuff, just think of\nAngola and the Democratic Republic\nof Congo. Natural resources feed into\nthe conflict trap since they provide\nsomething clearly worth fighting over,\nas seen in the movie Blood Diamond\nset in Sierra Leone. But natural resources can damage any country because they reduce the treasury\u2019s reliance on individual taxes, thus making\npoliticians less accountable to their\npeople. It is also much easier for politicians to embezzle money from natural resources and spend the money on\nsimply bribing community leaders for\ntheir people\u2019s votes.\nSimply giving poor countries money\nis the obvious answer. But when used\nunwisely, aid can be counterproduc-tive. When money flows into a country\nin the form of foreign currency (such\nas with aid) it needs to be converted\ninto local currency to be useful. However, aid isn\u2019t the only foreign currency that needs to become local; money\ngenerated from exporting goods also\nneeds to be converted into local cash.\nSo aid money actively competes with\nexports, reducing the value of engaging in the kind of trade which could\npull the country out of poverty. Added\nto this, many poor countries place\nhigh tariffs on imported goods, which\nmakes it even less likely that citizens\nwill want to purchase foreign cur-rency; they have nothing to buy with\nit, reducing the exchange value of the\naid.\nIt also isn\u2019t clear that aid necessarily brings growth (as argued most\nstrongly by NYU\u2019s William Easterly).\nCollier points out that a good natural\nexperiment for an increase in aid money can be seen by the increases in the\nNigerian governments revenues due to\nrecord oil prices; no additional growth\nfollowed. Not only can direct financial\naid have this effect, so can the debt relief so loudly trumpeted by the Live 8\nconcerts. This doesn\u2019t mean that aid is\ndoomed to failure; rather that it can\u2019t\nbe seen as a magic bullet.\nAnd aid money doesn\u2019t necessarily\ngo where the West might want it to go.\nCollier estimates that about 11% of\naid is actually spent on the country\u2019s\narmy, representing 40% of military\nspending. Interestingly, Collier finds\nthat the influx of aid increases the\nprobability of a coup; to the victors,\nthe spoils. Aid also reduces the need\nfor economic reform, as it removes its\nurgency.\nGiven this, Collier\u2019s conclusion\nis not that we should give up on aid,\nrather that it should be given when\nthe time is right. Corrupt governments\nwill only waste the stuff, but once a\ngenuine reformer gets in they should\nreceive all the help they can get.\nThis is undoubtedly the most controversial section in The Bottom Billion.\nRemember the $64bn lost by each civil\nwar? Collier argues that military intervention can prove to be one of the most\nsuccessful forms of aid, provided intervening forces are prepared to take real\nrisks, unlike the infamous peacekeepers\nin Rwanda, who would only fire when\nfired upon, not when civilians were at\nrisk. The economic arguments make a\nnovel addition to the tired (but compel-ling) moral ones.\nCollier, in all, seems convinced that we\ncan chip in. International regulation is his\nweapon of choice to tackle companies\nthat pay bribes and to provide a bench\nmark for reform minded politicians. His\ncase for military intervention is definitely\nthe most daring of his proposals and in a\npost Iraq world, the least likely to take\nplace. Aid can make a difference when\ndirected at the right time and at the right\nkind of investment (like infrastructure).\nThe book is certainly very \u2018big picture\u2019\nand a proper review of how aid works at\nthe local level will have to wait for my\nrereading of Poor Economics. All in all,\na worthwhile, interesting read.\nAnd the title of the book? Perhaps the\nmost successful criticism contained within the book is contained within that title.\nIt is time, Collier argues, to move away\nfrom seeing a world of 1 billion rich people and 5 billion poor when so many of\nthose poor are pulling themselves out of\npoverty. The Millennium Development\nGoals make this mistake by bunching the\nworld\u2019s poor together. A new development strategy focussed less on booming\nChina, India and Brazil could achieve a\nlot more for the poorest billion who, so\nfar, seem stuck at the bottom rung.\nThe world\nbeyond College\nwalls\npolitics.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nNatural Resources\nWhat Can Be Done?\nIran Mexico/US Egypt\nMilitary Intervention\nConclusion\nConflict\nAfter Tuesday\u2019s storming of the British Embassy in Iran by angry protes-tors, tensions have risen between\nIran and several European coun-tries. British diplomatic staff have\nbeen evacuated from the country\nand on Wednesday Germany and\nFrance announced they were also\nwithdrawing their embassy staff in\nTehran.\nWednesday saw a further breakdown in relations between London\nand Tehran as Foreign Secreary William Hague gave Iranian diplomats\n48 hours to leave the UK.\nUS police have found an impressive\ndrug tunnel, which links warehouses\nin Tijuana and San Diego. The tunnel\nis approximately 4.5 metres deep\nand contains lighting and transport\ncarts for efficient drug movement.\nMexican security forces seized\nthree tonnes of marijuana at the\ntunnel entrance shortly after discovering the tunnel in a warehouse in\nTijuana.\nA US police spokeswoman speaking during a press conference said it\nwas the most impressive drug tunnel they have found in 5 years.\nLast week protests in Tahrir Square\nwere restarted as the population\nshows its dissatisfaction with the\nrule of the military council that took\nover the governance of Egypt after\nthe deposition of former President\nHosni Mubarak. Since they started\nto lead the country, public safety\nhas decreased and economic investment in the country has de-clined. After increased pressure,\nthe Supreme Council of the Armed\nForces promised to hold a presidential election in June, as well as\nreleasing political prisoners.\nby Joseph Letts and Rajat Jain\n\n"

Then\nthey started arguing about if they were even really there or not. Luckily, they got round to debating\nGreece as well. Here it is...\nG\nreece has serious problems. Essentially they have run out of\nmoney, and lending any to them\nis seen as a very risky business.\nAs such, the lenders are only willing to offer high interest loans; this worsens the\nproblem as Greece\u2019s interest repayments increase\nand their budget deficit gets ever bigger.\nHow did they get into this mess? It\u2019s this sim-ple: the Greek government spent too much mon-ey. \u201cBut we\u2019re in a recession,\u201d you say. \u201cKeynes\nsays that we need to spend our way out! Increase\ngovernment spending \u2013 boost aggregate demand\u201d\nyou cry. Keynes does say this, but he also says\nthat you must save during the good times, during\nthe boom, so that you can afford to spend your\nway out of the bust.\nGreece didn\u2019t do this \u2013 they even managed to\nlose money during the boom years. And thus,\nthe seeds of disaster were planted. Because they\ndidn\u2019t save when they had the money, and because they have been borrowing too much for too\nlong, Greece simply can\u2019t just borrow and spend\ntheir way out of this mess.\nWhat normally happens in this situation? Well,\nusually governments have another trick up their\nsleeve. They print more money; they devalue\ntheir currency, and their debts are worth less. It\ndoesn\u2019t do the country much good, but it helps\nget rid of the debt. But Greece can\u2019t do this because they are part of the Euro.\nThey don\u2019t get to choose when their own currency is devalued. Political problems arise, because the rest of Europe, who still have money\nand are still trusted to borrow (mainly Germany\nand France) have to bail them out. These countries promise that they will guarantee the Greek\ndebt. And of course, Greece has to cut its spending to ensure they don\u2019t get into the same mess\ntwice. There will be years and years of harsh\nausterity as future Greek taxpayers are forced to\nbear the burdens of older generations who earned\ntoo little and spent too much. And what of the\nnext in line: Italy? Too big to fail, but also too big\nto bail. Italy\u2019s debts would swallow up the entire\nbailout fund, and maybe more. Not to mention\nthe fact that Italy is supposed to be one of the\nthree countries who are guaranteeing the bailout\nfund. We can\u2019t afford to bail out big-spenders\nforever.\nThere is another way, though. Let Greece fail\nand let the Greeks accept that the Euro has failed\nthem. Having one currency for multiple governments has meant that they could not fully control their own financial system and deal with the\ncrisis. Getting help from Germany means surrendering political freedom: Greece will have to do\nwhatever its masters tell it.\nIf they leave the Euro and return to their old\ncurrency, the Drachma, they can recover. Yes, it\nwill lose a lot of its value at first. Many Greek\ncivil servants, once part of a bloated bureaucra-cy, will have to get private sector jobs. But weak\ncurrencies can be the catalyst for future growth.\nGreeks will struggle to afford the import of foreign goods, but they will be able to sell products\nfor lower prices. Imports fall but exports rise.\nMoney will flow back into the country. Slowly\nbut surely the tide will turn and Greece can experience true growth, unlike the dangerous debt-filled bubble they resided in before.\nLet Greece have its own currency, let them devalue it, and let them sort out their problems. It\nis the only way to save Greece and save Europe.\nBailing out the countries which spend all of their\nmoney may seem like a good idea now, but one\nday Germany will run out of money to help with\nthese bailouts, or its voters will just say no. And\nwhen that happens, this crisis will look very, very\nsmall in comparison.\nW\nhen, in 2001, Greece joined the\nEurozone, it signed a treaty that\ncertified its membership of this\ngroup indefinitely. There was no\nclause that permitted the secession or expulsion of a state from this particular com-munity. This would make it very difficult for Greece\nto decide to leave or, equally likely, to be thrown\nout. Granted, it would not be impossible to create a\npathway by which states may leave the Eurozone,\nbut this would become problematic in the future.\nThe same problems would form that drove Abraham\nLincoln to declare war with, and reunite, the confederacy of the United States in 1860. If members of a\ngroup are free to come and go whenever they please,\nthe authority of the community is undermined; without unanimity, it is very difficult to achieve anything.\nIf a state feels that a policy is not in their interest,\nthey can simply leave. This makes it impossible for\nstrong community-based governance to occur and\nmakes the community indecisive, stagnant and slow\nto implement change. It also adds an internal political element to the decision, where leaders of member\ncountries can gain political capital by threatening to\nexit the Eurozone unless their state\u2019s demands are\nsatisfied. This would be in nobody\u2019s interests, since\nit makes it very difficult for the community to fulfil\nits goals and aid co-operation of member states.\nThe main danger with Greece is that of disorderly\ndefault. This would occur if Greece could not meet\nits financial obligations and so decided to simply\ngive up. In this instance, there would be huge losses\nfor investors, not just within Greece but across the\nworld. Many French banks would be heavily hit,\nas they hold large numbers of Greek Government\nbonds. This would generate a wave of instability\nthat would threaten to shatter both fragile and more\nsecure economies in Europe. Even if it wasn\u2019t possible to prevent a default in Greece and the levels of\nbailout were not sufficient for Greece to meet all of\nits obligations, a public attempt is important. If other\nEuropean nations make a clear and public demonstration to Greece that they are supporting it in its\nhour of need and attempting to shore-up its fragile\neconomy, Greece will be much less likely to turn\naround and give up on Europe and its payments. A\nstrong partnership between Greece with the rest of\nEurope is likely to mean that Greece can be kept on\ntrack and any default, should it occur, can be rigidly controlled to minimize the damage and risk of\nspread.\nThis element of contagion is also important with\nrespect to global investor confidence. Many foreign\ninvestors have been wary of investing in Southern\nEuropean economies \u2013 as well as Western European\neconomies to some extent \u2013 since Greek financial\nwoes came to the fore. If Europe is seen as being\ndecisive and clear in its support of Greece, investor confidence in other European countries will be\nsounder. This is important as it has consequences in\nterms of borrowing for government bonds, such as\ninterest rates.An amputation of Greece from Europe\nwould mean a long period of instability in Greece\n(see Argentina from 1999 onwards) and likely a disastrous return for foreign investors: who, if they feel\nthat countries will be allowed to fail and then jettisoned from the community, will be much more wary\nof Europe as a whole.\nTo conclude, it is practically important that Greece\nbe bailed out and allowed to continue as a function-ing, participating member of the Eurozone. Precedent for secession would cripple any executive fiscal\npower of the Eurozone, reducing it to a meaningless association. Unmanageable debts would also\nincrease the likelihood of disorderly default, a catastrophic global economic event. More importantly,\nhowever, is the need for Europe to be seen to publicly support Greece for reasons of global confidence\nand internal feelings of security and community by\nEurozone nations.\n\u201cShould the Greek Economy be allowed\nto fail?\u201d\n\u201c \u201d \u201c \u201d\nit is practically important\nthat Greece... continue\nas a functioning,\nparticipating member of\nthe Eurozone\nLet Greece have its\nown currency, let them\ndevalue it, and let\nthem sort out their\nproblems\n\n"

    "content": "COMMENT\nFELIX Friday 02 december 2011 15\nSave us from loneliness, send in your articles. Just remember the mantra below.\nThe views and opinions expressed here are those of the author, and not Felix.\n\u201d\nR\neading that title, you can\nprobably roughly guess\nwhat this article is going\nto be about. It\u2019s the trains\nin Britain. I used to think\nthe trains being often delayed, expensive and not running much on the weekend was an Essex thing, innit. It appears\nthat I was wrong in that assumption,\nand Mock The Week panellists must be\npleased that it\u2019s widespread enough for\neveryone to appreciate their jokes. I\u2019m\njust going to go straight for the jugular\nhere: the trains in Britain need to be re-nationalised\nI can\u2019t pretend to know much about what\nthe trains were like in the past. I also can\u2019t\nreally reliably ask anyone: if I ask my mum\n(who, if she\u2019s reading, I\u2019m eating loads of\nfruit and working so hard that I could technically take Imperial to some sort of criminal tribunal) she runs out of the room to\ngrab her most rose-tinted of spectacles and\ntell me everything was perfect. So, what I\nknow is what is here at the moment. Obviously, it wasn\u2019t always perfect then, it\u2019s not\nperfect now, and it will never be perfect.\nWe should look to improve what we have\nnow. Saying \u201cyeah, well, if you look at it\nobjectively it used to suck so why does it\nmatter if it\u2019s awful now\u201d is a bit defeatist.\nWe constantly should be trying to find a\nway to improve a service.\nYou may, at this moment, be shouting,\n\u201chey look you massive arsehole, we\u2019re\nover two paragraphs in and you haven\u2019t\nmade an argument yet\u201d.To this I would say\nthat calling me an arsehole is a bit strong,\nwhat are you \u2013 a YouTube commenter?\nPadraic Calpin\nTim Arbabzadah\nThe Occupy Protests are succeeding.\nJust look at this paper\nThis title has been delayed\nNever fear, the \u2018well thought out\u2019argument\nis coming up now.\nAs mentioned above, I live in Essex.\nI used to get the train to and from school\nevery day. They were average at best, very\nexpensive, and they were not either large\nenough or frequent enough to have the\nroom for everyone to sit. The trains are privatised and are run by a private company.\nThe idea is that this causes competition\nand the companies have to improve their\nservice to gain customers. Sounds fine in\ntheory, but there is one massive gaping\nproblem: only one company runs all of\nthe trains on the line. This is where, like\na cricketer who was thinking about Scarlett Johansson just as he\u2019s about to make a\ncatch, privatisation drops the ball. Even if\nI wanted to choose a different train com-pany, as the current one wasn\u2019t giving me\nwhat I wanted, I couldn\u2019t. In fact, even if\nI drove (slightly defeating the point of a\nconvenient train station) to another nearby\nstation it would still be the same company.\nWhen you fly from, say, Heathrow, you\ncan choose what airline you use (e.g Virgin\nor BA).You can get to the same destination\nusing either airline. They have to compete\nin terms of quality, price, or the best compromise of the two for your custom. This\ngives them an incentive to keep prices low\nand quality high. How can this be applied\nto a service where I only have one option?\nHow does the idea of competition meaning better service apply when a company\nhas a monopoly? I concede, perhaps, you\ncould argue that they had to compete for a\nGovernment contract, but that\u2019s not every\nyear and once they have it they have the\nT\nhe Occupy movement, inspired by protest in Spain,\nmade famous in New York\nand now a global phenom-enon, is succeeding. On the\nface of it, this might seems to be an audacious claim. Indeed, some of you will be\nreading this and audibly scoffing; \u201cThey\nhave no clear goals; what are they succeeding at?\u201d\nActually (though I would firmly suggest\nyou read their statement at occupylsx.org),\nthat question is surprisingly valid. There is\nno single event that will definitively cause\nthe protesters to say \u201cright, job done\u201d, and\nhead home. Though the movement advocates some specific policies, such as the\nabolition of Tax Havens, the main focus is\nsomething more fundamental.\nWhat these protests aim to do is to encourage public thought, discussion and\ndebate over the social, economic and political issues that affect all of us each day.\nIn short, they are trying to effect the end of\nsocietal apathy.\nWhat the occupiers have recognised is\nthat a movement will fail without wider\nsupport, especially when you seek to\nerode the concentration of power held by\nthe 1%. As such, they have sought to include as many people as possible from day\none. For example, the London protesters\nhave set up Tent City University and the\nnewly opened Bank of Ideas, holding daily\nfree talks and discussions. Even the camps\nthemselves welcome anyone, whether\nyou\u2019re a purposeful visitor or a curious\npasser-by.\nFor another example, consider the\nmovement\u2019s General Assemblies used\nto decide everything from appropriation\nof food to writing their political agenda.\nTotally \u2018horizontal\u2019 and once again open\nto anyone, the GA reaches decisions via\ncollective agreement, and under the rules\nany spectator can vocalise their particular\nopinion or reservations.\nWhen the protests began, many sceptics\nmay have glibly remarked that for \u201cthe\n99%\u201d, the number of people demonstrating seemed somewhat small. But, through\nthis focus on public awareness, it has taken\nless than three months for a single camp to\nswell into a global phenomenon.\nIt is with this in mind that I declare the\nOccupy movement is succeeding. You\nneed only look to this, the student paper of\nmonopoly.\nThe operator on your line can basically\nhold you to ransom. They know that you\nneed them and can therefore mess you\nabout as much as they like.An opportunity\nthey didn\u2019t need a second invite to take.\nTicket prices constantly soaring, less staff\naround, more delays, and don\u2019t even try to\nget a train on Sunday or you will be banished to hell (replacement bus service \u2013 at\nthe same price as a train, of course). Why\nshouldn\u2019t they? They have no incentive\nto be anything better than the minimum\nrequired guidelines. They know any improvement will be wasted, as people have\nto use them anyway. What can I do? I can\u2019t\nforce them to improve by taking a different operator\u2019s trains; I have to forgo trains\nentirely to protest. For many people (not to\nmention the congestion it would cause on\nthe roads) this just isn\u2019t a practical solution.\nAnother argument, often used for privati-sation, is that it takes the burden of the cost\nof running the train service away from the\ntax payer and places it onto a company that\nwill use ticket prices to recoup the money\nspent and make a profit. The trouble being that this hands the operator a no win\nno fee situation. If the train company goes\nbust they have to be bailed out, as the trains\ncan\u2019t just be allowed to stop running. They\nwon\u2019t try to go bust, but they don\u2019t have\nto be that careful as they have a safety net.\nWhat I don\u2019t understand is why the Government just lets a company reap all the\nrewards of privatisation and have no con-sequences. Why don\u2019t they just do all the\nrunning of the trains in house?\nThe train service is a public service; it is\na reputably apolitical institution, to see that\nit has managed to provoke a public debate.\nIn the past month we\u2019ve seen no fewer\nthan three comment pieces on the Occupations and two features on public protest.\nHowever, this success marks only the\nbeginning. These protests have become\nmore than simply clumps of tents; they\nhave become an ideology, merging seam-lessly with the wider public outcry that\nsaw 61% of British people support the November 30 strike.\nAs @OccupyWallStreetNYC tweeted,\n\u201cYou Can\u2019t Evict An Ideal\u201d. Cheesy? Yes.\nBut, in fact, already vindicated: two weeks\nago, after 200 people were forced from\nZucotti Park, more than 1000 took to the\nstreets of New York, and the demonstrations show no sign of stopping.\nThe train service\nis a public service\n... it just makes no\nsense for it to be\nprivatised\n\u201c\nThe tra\nThe tra\nis a pu\nis a pu\nthere to provide you with a cheap, readily\navailable means of transportation. It just\nmakes no sense for it to be privatised. It\nshould be in the public domain, so it can be\nrunintheinterestofthepublic.I\u2019mnotsaying suddenly everything would be perfect,\nbut it would be a start. I also understand\nthat it can\u2019t have a bottomless pit of money\nto use, but it would be there to run the best\nservice with the available resources, not to\nmake the most money from it.\nPrivate companies are there to make\nmoney, but there are just some things\nwhere making money isn\u2019t the overall objective and they therefore shouldn\u2019t play a\npart. The NHS is another example where a\nservice must be kept as a public service. If\nyou disagree with that, then the other main\npoint is that you don\u2019t even get the benefits\nof competition.\nThe reward for reading this article\nis a picture of Scarlett Johansson\n\n"

This\nweek, we have one of the quirkier Imperial sports on display: Dodgeball. Alan\nSoltani, a 3rd year physicist and Dodgeball club captain, is the man of the hour.\nWe meet up in Beit quad to talk about\nballs, wrenches and more.\nI\u2019m not quite sure what to expect coming into the interview \u2013 what would the\n\u2018dodgeball type\u2019 be? Very friendly, as\nit turns out. I kick things off by asking\na bit about the structure and organisation of the club, and where Alan fits in.\n\u201cI\u2019m club captain, as well as being first\nteam captain \u2013 we also have a president\nthough. My role involves organising\nthe competitive side of the club, the\nmatches, coaching and training.\u201d How\nmany teams do Dodgeball have? \u201cThis\nyear, we\u2019ve got three teams, which is the\nmost we\u2019ve ever had. Teams are mixed,\nwith the game played six-a-side. We\ntook twenty-one people to the university\nchampionships a few weeks ago.\u201d\nAs I don\u2019t remember anyone from\ndodgeball sending in a report about that,\nI ask him to tell me more: \u201cThere were\nthirty teams competing at Cranfield uni-versity, in the \u2018experienced\u2019 teams cat-egory. The first team did pretty well,\ngetting to the quarter finals and losing\nto eventual winners Warwick \u2013 who are\none of the strongest teams in the country.\u201d Promising stuff, I think.\nSo what is the competition structure\nfor the sport? \u201c The UK dodgeball teams\nare divided into leagues of eight teams,\nwith the Premiership being the top one.\nWe\u2019re in the league below that, but we\nhaven\u2019t played any of our matches yet,\nour first fixtures are this Saturday. One\nthing to point out is that the leagues\naren\u2019t run by BUCS: there is a mix of\nuniversity and non-university teams.\u201d\nWhat are the team\u2019s objectives for the\nseason, I ask. After your result at the\nchampionships, are you the favourites to\nget promoted? \u201cWe weren\u2019t at the start\nof the season, but we have beaten some\npremier league teams in warm-up open\ntournaments and people have started to\ntake notice. Hopefully we can keep playing like this and go up.\u201d\nI\u2019m curious about the club\u2019s history \u2013\nsurely it was founded pretty recently?\n\u201cWhen I joined as a fresher, in 2009,\nthe club was in its second year of ex-istence. As far as I know it was formed\nby a group of medics who aren\u2019t here\nany more\u2026but the club has continued.\u201d\nHow was the fresher intake for this year?\n\u201cReally solid. We started having training\nsessions in Ethos just this year, before\nthat we would use the Union concert hall\n\u2013 which is surprisingly good for dodge-ball. Training at Ethos makes it easier to\ndraw in newcomers or people who want\nto give it a go, though, and I\u2019d say we\nhave about 35-40 people per training\nsession.\u201d\nDo they have official dodgeball balls\nand everything? \u201cYeah, of course! It\u2019s\nnot rubber, actually, but inflatable with\na soft outside layer.\u201d He shows me one,\nand what immediately comes to mind is\na Volleyball, but a bit lighter and slightly\npadded. Alan tells me it\u2019s soft enough\nthat head shots are allowed\u2026perhaps\nwith a bit too much of a grin on his face.\nNow for the serious stuff: how did he\nget into Dodgeball? \u201cactually, when I\nwas at school, I used to watch this programme called Extreme Dodgeball that\nwas on Sky. It just followed a bunch\nof American players around, and introduced the world of dodgeball, but it was\nawesome! When I got to uni and saw\nthe dodgeball stand at fresher\u2019s fair, I\nthought \u2018I\u2019ll give it a go\u2019, and then just\nended up loving it.\u201d\nIt seems to be a recurring theme, this,\nof people picking up a sport at university and becoming the captain a few\nyears down the line\u2026So how easy is it\nto progress at dodgeball? What skills are\nneeded? \u201cIt\u2019s essentially a throwing and\ncatching game, and those are the things\nyou need to work on \u2013 along with speed,\nreflexes, that sort of thing. It\u2019s pretty\neasy to progress rapidly, if you\u2019re shown\nwhat to do. We [the people who joined at\nthe same time as Alan - Ed.] took ages to\nprogress, though, because at first we had\nno idea what we were doing, and no-one\nwas really there to show us the ropes.\nThe new lot are picking it up really\nquickly as they have us to teach them.\u201d\nFinally, the question I have to ask:\nwas DodgeBall, the film a blessing or a\ncurse for the sport? \u201c Definitely a bless-ing. UK dodgeball didn\u2019t kick off until\nthe film came out \u2013 there was a guy in\nLeicester who saw the film, thought \u2018this\nis wicked\u2019 and started the UK dodgeball\nassociation\u201d.\nTo be very honest, most people had a\nbit of a laugh when I told them I\u2019d be\ninterviewing the dodgeball captain. I\ntell Alan this, and he concurs. It\u2019s not\nalways the easiest sport to admit to\nplaying seriously. \u201c I\u2019ve had quite a bit\nof stick over the years, especially when\nyou say you play dodgeball competitively\u2026but I\u2019m used to it!\u201d As the great\nPatches O\u2019Houlihan once said, \u201cIf you\ncan dodge a wrench, you can dodge a\nball.\u201d You just have to be prepared to\ntake some stick for it.\nCaptains\u2019 Interviews:\nDodgeball Club Captain\nEssential info:\nAlan Soltani, 20, Physics 3rd year\n1m83, 76kg, throws with right arm\n3 years\u2019 dodgeball experience\nLikes: toe-snapping shots, wrenches\nDislikes: Minotaur dodgeball, wrenches\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8\n9 10 10\n11 12 13\n13 14 15 15 16\n17 18 18 19 19 20\n21\n20 21 22 23 24\n24 26 25 27\n26 29\n11 12 15\n16 17 18 19 20\n21\n22 23 24 25\n26 23\n25\n28\n22\n17\n17\n14\n16\n\n"

While we know much\nabout how this section of our planet affects us in terms of magnetism, energy\ngeneration and planetary dynamics,\nits precise makeup has remained hazy.\nUntil recently all we knew was that the\ncore is composed of predominantly liquid iron, along with small amounts of\nnickel, and 10% (by weight) of light\nelements.\nResearchers have now used a mix of\nseismic and geophysical data, in conjunction with laboratory models, to\ndetermine the relative proportions of\nthese light elements present at the centre of our rocky planet. New research\nby Haijun Huang and colleagues,\npublished in Nature, examines their\nrespective abundances and comes to\na surprising conclusion \u2013 the Earth\u2019s\ncore is oxygen-poor.\nThe composition of the Earth\u2019s core\nis vital; differing elemental proportions\nwould result in different rates of cool-ing, rate of core growth, and evolution\nof our internal geodynamo \u2013 something that results in the generation of\nand variation shown in our magnetic\nfield. By examining our core, it is also\npossible to gain remarkable insight into\nthe conditions present when the Earth\nformed, and its subsequent geochemi-cal evolution.\nThe Earth\u2019s core is known to be composed of a large, liquid outer core that\nhouses a smaller, solid inner core \u2013 this\nis shown well on the accompanying\nimage. The extreme temperature and\npressure conditions make it difficult\nto investigate how seismic isotropy,\nvelocity and density would differ with\nthe presence of varying light elements.\nPossible suspects for this light element\nquota include sulphur, oxygen, silicon,\ncarbon and hydrogen, due to their solubility at the temperature and pressure\nranges required.\nHuang and the research team performed shock-compression experi-ments, where samples are subjected\nto core-like conditions through high-velocity impacts. Experiments such as\nthese have played a major role in unveiling current knowledge about core\ncomposition; when iron-rich samples\nare used the results are extremely close\nto those we expect to occur in our core.\nThe researchers used liquid samples in\norder to increase the accuracy of their\nfindings as far as possible, and measured the sound velocity of the shocked\nsamples along with the density and\ntemperature states achieved through\nthe impact.\nComparing these sound velocities and densities with the geophysical seismic data known for the core,\nHuang and colleagues were able to\nrule out certain compositions. They\nexperimented by splitting the 10%\nby weight between oxygen, sulphur\nand iron, and found that samples with\nmore than 2.5% oxygen by weight\nwere unable to match the required\ndataset for density, temperature and\nsound velocity. \u201cThe results show that\nwe can rule out oxygen as a major\nlight element in the liquid outer core,\u201d\nsay the researchers.\nWhile sulphur is able to match the\ndataset required, previous accretion\nmodels have limited the proportion of\nthis element to only a small amount.\nHuang and colleagues have significantly advanced our understanding of\nthe Earth\u2019s geochemical origins and\nelemental structure, but further ex-Nicola Guttridge\nEarth\u2019s core deprived of oxygen\nFacebook is making the world even smaller\nFacebook has conducted a joint study\nwhich suggests that there are, on\naverage, 3.74 degrees of separation\nbetween users on the popular social\nnetworking website. The study, joint\nbetween Facebook\u2019s data scientist\nLars Backstrom and four researchers\nfrom the University of Milan, found\nthat the number of people that link\ntwo others on average is approximately four. That is, as the authors of\nthe study explain, \u201cwhen considering\nanother person in the world, a friend\nof your friend knows a friend of their\nfriend.\u201d\nThe study was carried out in May\nbefore the \u2018Subscriptions\u2019 feature\nwas added to Facebook and celebrity\nfan \u2018Pages\u2019 were not taken into account in the data. All active members\nof the site were included in the study,\nand users were deemed to be such if\nthey had logged on at least once over\na 28 day period. This marks the largest test regarding Hungarian author\nFrigyes Karinthy\u2019s idea that there\nwere six degrees of separation between any two people on Earth. The\nhypothesis has long since been tested\nwith various samples, including a notable effort by psychologist Stanley\nMilgram in the 1960s involving delivering a letter to an arbitrary person\nby passing through acquaintances.\nFacebook\u2019s social graph data had\n721 million members at the time of\nthe experiment, with a total of 69\nbillion friendships. The researchers\nwere able to analyse the data using\nrules from graph theory within discrete mathematics and by performing\ncombinatorical analysis. They used a\n24-core computer with a 1 terabyte\n(TB) hard disk to crunch the num-bers, costing them \u201cno more than a\ncouple of thousand pounds\u201d.\nFacebook typically limits users to a\nmaximum cap of 5,000 friends. The\nAlexander Karapetian\nSir Paul Nurse spoke at the dinner\n\u201d\nThere are on average\n3.74 degrees of\nseparation between\nusers on Facebook\n\u201c\nThere ar\nThere ar\nNovember 26 saw the first of what is\nhoped to be an annual convening of the\nscience societies of universities in the UK\nat a dinner, attended by some of the most\nprestigious names in the discipline.\nGuests of honour included HRH The\nDuke of Kent; Nobel laureate Sir Paul\nNurse, who received his prize for his research into cell duplication; Sir Roland\nJackson from the British Science Association; and Professor Kevin Warwick,\ndescribed as the \u201cworld\u2019s first cyborg\u201d for\nimplanting a RFID chip in his body.\nDinner was followed by an amusing\nand inspiring speech by Sir Nurse, who\ndescribed his path into science (beginning\nwith the sight of Sputnik 2 over the skies\nof Neasden), his work that led on to his\nNobel Prize, and where he sees science in\nthe future.\nOf special note is the Frances Crick Institute, opening in 2015. Nurse described\nthe Institute as being \u201canarchic,\u201d with\n1,500 staff being organized in no departmental structure. It is hoped this way of\nstructuring the Institute will lead to increased freedom, with no senior managers causing roadblocks to new research\nproposals. When asked if there are any\nexamples of this arrangement in practice,\nNurse did, however, reply \u201cin my head\u201d.\nNurse also urged the attendees to use\ntheir scientific skills for the good of the\nnation. While he stressed that only those\nwith a deep passion for science should\ngo on to do research, it was important,\nhe said, that we ensure that public are of\na sound scientific knowledge, especially\nas the future becomes even more scientifically advanced. He used an example of\nthe lack of scientists in Parliament as an\nexample of where we fail at the moment,\nespecially considering the ill-informed\ndebate in the past, such as over GM crops.\nScience\nSocieties\nperimentation is required using different mixes of light elements in order to\nfully determine the composition of our\ncore.\nDOI: 10.1038/nature10621\nmedian amount from the sample size\nrepresentative of 10% of the global\npopulation was only 100 friends,\naccounting for 0.000014% of Facebook\u2019s total membership.

But let\u2019s face it: we\u2019re\nImperial students. Inevitably, the moment does come when normal discourse\ncollapses into a frenzied exposition on\nGraph Automorphisms and the implications of Zorn\u2019s Lemma.\nIn the heat of the moment, having everyone jostling around the puny Pukka\nPad on the kitchen table can be pretty\nfrustrating. It disrupts the flow, forcing\neveryone to be louder and more violent\nas they try to get their point across.\nThe solution to all this? A whiteboard\nstation. The equations are up there on the\nwall in nice, big letters that everyone can\nread, there\u2019s enough space for everyone\nto stand around, and, with multiple pens,\npeople don\u2019t have to fight each other\nfor scribbling rights. On top of all this,\nthere\u2019s the added bonus that anything\nyou write will seem instantly important\n\u2013 simply by virtue of being scrawled up\non a board.\nAnd the boards can be put to a lot more\nuse than you first might think. Ours have\nbeen used for games of Pictionary; language lessons; even just leaving messages for each other (\u201cpay rent\u201d being\nthe most common). It functions as a nice\nlittle communal place for people to gather around. You might never have thought\nof making one, yet once you have it it\nsomehow seems indispensable.\nThe size of your station will depend on a few things: the number\nof people living in your flat, the\nlength of uninterrupted wall space\nyou have, and what your budget\nis. We have three whiteboards\nside-by-side, spanning about\nthree metres in total.\nWhile this guide will be for a\nthree-board set-up, you can easily tailor it for more or less boards\nas you see fit. (Do be warned,\nthough, that while the boards\nmight look big in the shop, once\nthey\u2019re up on the wall you\u2019ll quickly\nfind yourself running out of writing\nspace.) Here\u2019s what you\u2019ll need:\n\u2022 Whiteboard: 30\u201d x 90\u201d (x3)\n\u2022 Pack of sticky fixers\n\u2022 Board markers (x3)\n\u2022 Cloths for wiping (x3)\n\u2022 String\n\u2022 Nails (x3)\nMost of these can be picked up at\nan ordinary stationery shop. The bulk\nof the cost will, of course, come from\nthe boards. They\u2019re usually around\n\u00a315 a pop, but if you\u2019re lucky enough\nto catch a sale at Ryman\u2019s you can\nget them for half that.\nOnce you have all of the above, it\u2019s\ntime to get down to business. First\nthing to do is hammer a nail into the\ntop-right corner of each board. We\u2019ll\nbe using this later to hang the markers and wiping cloths.\nWe\u2019re going to use the sticky fixers\nto attach the boards to the wall. You\ncould use nails, but your landlord\nmight not be best pleased about\nthis; in fact, on the subject of pissing\nHow to do it off landlords, if you cheap out on the\nsticky fixers there\u2019s a chance they\ncould leave some nasty marks on\nthe wall when you eventually remove\nthe boards.\nNow that I\u2019ve cleared myself of any\nlegal trouble: apply the sticky fixers\nliberally to the back of each board\n(i.e. use at least 15), and attach the\nboards to the wall in a line (if you\u2019re\nreally anal about this, you could use\na spirit level to make sure they\u2019re\nperfectly straight).\nWith the main task done, you\u2019re\ngoing to need something for writing and erasing. Tie each of the\nboard markers and wiping cloths\nto a piece of string, ensuring the\nstring is long enough to fully cross\nthe diagonal of each board. Put a\nloop in the other end, and hang\none board marker and one wiping\ncloth on the nail in the corner of\neach board.\nAnd voila! You\u2019re done. Months\nof merriment await you and your\nflatmates. If the board gets too\ndirty, give it a spray with some\ncleaning fluid and it\u2019ll be good as\nnew. Enjoy!\nNext week is the last issue before Christmas! Please, please, send in your Home & Garden stories. If you do, Navid can stop writing the kind of nonsense you see above. If we don\u2019t get any submissions, next time he\u2019ll be teaching you how to make a scale\nmodel of Santa\u2019s sleigh. I\u2019m not joking.

The day of the game was incredibly fog-gy; almost causing the game to be called off.\nThankfully, it cleared enough for it to continue,\nbut visibility remained low. This was lucky for\nImperial as the Knights famously relied on\ntheir passing game; which was difficult in the\nheavy fog.\nThe first half was an eventful one; the Immortals almost scoring on their first drive but\nwere stopped just ten yards from the Knights\nend-zone. On the second drive the Immortals\nline began barging through the Knights defence\nand leading Tino Millar in to the Knight\u2019s endzone for the first score of the game; which with\nthe conversion took Imperial into a 7-0 lead.\nReading retaliated; using an incredibly quick\nquarter-back they were able to run the ball\nagainst the Imperial defence. The ball in Imperial possession was forced up the field straight\ninto the Knights end-zone, with Quarterback\nRob Wolstenholme carrying a QB sneak in for\na touchdown to make the score 14-0 (after the\nsuccessful conversion) at the half.\nThe start of the second half saw Reading\nhave to start their offensive drive on their own\n20 yard line as the Immortals kick-off and\nkick return teams had absolutely outstanding\nperformances all day. The Imperial defence\nforced a number of mistakes and got a few\nsacks and big tackles; forcing Reading to punt\nyet again. The immortals offense again carried\nthe ball almost to the Reading end-zone; but\nlost momentum and were stopped by powerful defence by the Knights. Reading adapted\nto the Imperial defence and changed their offensive formation; suddenly finding they could\nrun the ball.\nOn a 4th down, the Immortals had the\nchance to stop the drive but made more mistakes which allowed the Knights to score. After a failed pass for the two point conversion;\nthe score was 14-6 with the Immortals suddenly having a game on their hands.\nThe ball was traded back and forth, the defences of each team containing the struggling\noffenses. However, the Immortals, on a 3rd\ndown decided to go for the same play which\nworked so well against the Bears the week be-fore. The Reading defence allowed the ball to\nbe thrown a solid 40 yards to hit the free receiver Max Stubenvoll who managed, despite\ntripping over his own feet, to keep hold of the\nball for an Immortals touchdown at the end of\nthe third quarter, making the score 20-6.\nReading were forced into their original formation in an attempt to successfully pass the\nball up the field as they needed to score repeat-edly. A fine defensive performance by Arjav\nTrivedi meant that the Reading run-game had\nno chance as he made a number of essential\ntackles, forcing the Knights into desperate\npasses.\nOne of these desperate passes was thrown\ninto the chest of an oblivious and unattractive Rob Wolstenholme (who had stepped in\nas a Defensive safety) who barely managed to\ndrunkenly stumble into the Knights end-zone\nfor the final score of the game; finishing 27-6.\nThis was known to be the hardest game of\nthe season for the Immortals. Portsmouth were\nthe defending National champions and were\nnotorious for their size and cheap tactics so Imperial would have to fight hard but were hampered by a number of injuries. However, both\nteams were coming into the game with a 3-0\nwin streak so there was everything to play for.\nThe first half was a wake-up call for the Immortals; Portsmouth had a team full of heavy\nguys who were powerful and fast. Imperial\nwere used to having a strong kick-off The Destroyers are known to have the best defence in\nthe country and the Imperial offence struggled\nto move the ball at all; a theme that continued\nthroughout the day. With Portsmouth in possession the defence started making the big hits\nthat have been a theme for the season so far.\nUnfortunately, over commitment to particular blocks meant on Portsmouth\u2019s second play\na Running back was able to break free of a\ntackle and run the 40 yards into the Immortals\nend-zone, but failed to convert. The next offensive passage of play ended abruptly, and the\ndefence were soon back on the field. But this\ntime no mistakes were made and on 4th down\na Portsmouth punt went awry after some heavy\npressure; the Immortal\u2019s offence took the field\nwith the ball 1-yard away from the Portsmouth\nend-zone.\nRob Wolstenholme easily carried the ball\nfor a touchdown with a QB sneak as the Portsmouth players were unable to approach someone with such an overpowering body odour;\nmeaning the first quarter finished with the Immortals leading 7-6.\nThe second quarter was where the Immortals\nfell apart. First with the Portsmouth defence\nsacking the Immortals in their own touchdown\narea for a safety; and then the Destroyer offence\nscoring two long yard running touchdown\nthrough a shambling Immortals defence. Imperial looked as if it couldn\u2019t wait for the end of\nthe half, as a team wracked with injuries from\nearlier games hobbled off the field to a score\nof 24-7. With their heads down, the Immortals\nwere in real trouble, but thankfully Mike Peacock was able to bring life back to a suffering\nteam with his inspirational words\nThe second half was not particularly event-ful; the Destroyers clearly assuming they were\ngoing to score a lot more points had their offence destroyed thanks to some powerful play\nby Temi Ladega and Jordan Douglas.\nThe Immortals defence failed to capitalise\non the struggling Portsmouth offence, how-ever, barely managing to move the ball against\nthe best Defence in the country. Instead the\nImmortals had to console themselves with a\nscoreless half against the reigning national\nchamps; finishing the game with their first loss\nof the season so far.\nStarting the second half of the season at 3-1\nwith the only loss being to the national champions is something the Immortals, barely 4\nyears old, can be incredibly proud of. Hopefully, with hard work and time for injuries to heal,\na full Immortals team can take the rest of the\nseason head-on, maybe even fighting their way\nto the playoffs. Good luck Imperial Immortals.\nKill it! Kill it with fire! Or with a brutal tackle\nImperial Immortals 27\nReading Knights 6\nImpeial Immortals 7\nPortsmouth Destroyers 24\n\n"

The first term revue of late has\nprogressively developed into something more elaborate. While still based\naround a collection of well-known\nshow tunes, the plot element and staging of these performances has become\never more ambitious. The sheer scale\nof this term\u2019s production meant that,\nattending my preview, I was terrified\nthat perhaps in an attempt to outdo last\nyear\u2019s exquisite Imperial Collage, the\nwell-meaning folk of one of Imperial\u2019s\nmost vibrant and active societies had\ncompletely over-reached themselves.\nThe script, written by Shamini Bundell for this performance, sounded\ncompletely mental and the cast was\nhuge. Settling down with apprehen-sion, what I saw unfurl before me was\nbeyond what I could have possibly\nimagined. The animated anarchic explosion of drama and pure, unbridled,\nand not-a-little-bit camp fun that followed had me either in stiches or semi-rapturous joy.\nThe general concept of the story line\nis a pastiche of several of Grimms\u2019\nFairy Tales, similar, in a way, to Shrek.\nHowever, like that perennially re-com-missioned children\u2019s classic, the use of\nwell-known characters is not overbearing on the plot itself; rather it allows for\na familiar background on which the ac-tion, concerning a few intertwined love\nstories and a traveling band of lesbian\ncat bandits, can take place.\nI can\u2019t begin to think of where to\nstart chucking the praise in terms of\nwho deserves it most. Ms Bundell has\ncrafted a fantastic script that manages\nto keep you laughing without wallowing in trying to be funny for the sake\nof it. Any weaker gags are carried by\nthe strength of the cast, who with such\nIt\u2019s been nearly eight years to the day\nsince the final installment of the Lord\nof the Rings trilogy hit our screens\n- eight long years with little but oversexed vampires and undersexed boy\nwizards to fill the void. Clearly spotting\nan audience starved of orcs and elves,\nDramsoc\u2019s latest productions takes the\nDungeons and Dragons out of Beit\nbasements and brings them to the stage.\nWritten and directed by Al Norman,\nOf Dice and Men takes a tongue-in-cheek look at role playing fantasy\ngames. It centres on five friends, each\nof varying enthusiasm, and their in-game characters as they quest their way\na game of Witches and Wyverns. With\nastute observations of life in both the\nreal world and in fantasy, the play is\nsuited to novices and level 3 Paladins\nalike. Encounters with a princess, who\nis more Miami than Mordor, and a frank\nchat with Phil the Wraith are the kind of\nthing that would probably have Tolkien\nturning in his grave. Equally, I imagine\nrepresentatives of Deutsche Bank \u2013 the\nshow\u2019s sponsors \u2013 may find themselves\nsquirming in their seats as the goblins\nbicker over maximizing teamwork and\nleadership skills.\nDespite its two-hour duration, ODAM\nmaintains its freshness by hopping\nbetween Terramundus and the Bowmans\u2019 house. Brothers Evan and Drake\n(played with aplomb by Luke Bullard\nand Ranulf Kinloch-Jones) clash as the\nformer tries to introduce his girlfriend\nKate (the tireless Camilla Nicholson)\nto the game, much to the disgust of\ncharacter-hat-wearing die-hard player\nDrake. Sarah Brand brings a deadpan\ntone to her role as lesbian witch Ivy and\nHassan Choudhury completes the band\nwith a modicum of sanity, playing game\nmaster Simon.\nOver in the Western Realm, things\nare more farcical still. James Goodchild\nstruts the stage scantily-clad as Conanlookalike Teflon, combining dopey delivery with deft comic timing. In the\nmond for his stellar performance as the\nPrince, but also to Rebecca Miller as\nthe villainous Mayor; Chris Witham\u2019s\ndebut performance for MT Soc as Buttons was particularly impressive.\nI really can\u2019t stress enough how much\nof a great time I had at this show. Fortune favours the brave and this production has levels of bravery akin to someone trying to revise for an end of year\nA Fairytale Shredding\nWill Prince\nWraith the roof with DramSoc\nMatt Allinson\na short amount of time for rehearsing\nhave between them managed to build\nup a spectacular ensemble perfor-mance. What is most obviously recognisable to an audience member is that\neveryone on stage is having an absolute\nblast. The energy they positively throw\ninto the crowd whips you along in the\nshow\u2019s tidal wave. Special mention of\ncourse always has to go to Phil Ray\u201cI can\u2019t begin to think\nof where to start\nchucking the praise\u201d\nclosest thing I could find to a similarity\nwith the Steinbeck novel from which\nthe play takes its name, Omar Fahmy\nbrings shades of Lenny to his role of the\norc poet, Urg, contrasted by the flesh-hungry energy of Zoe Pierre as Gaboosa. Miztli Cardena Neville, as Areya,\nadds the finishing touch, maintaining a\ngrave voice of reason in the face of the\nhapless fellowship.\nThe specials effects are innovative to\nsay the least and give ODAM an unpretentious charm, best exemplified when a\nclimactic fight scene is paused as Mrs.\nBowman hands out Ribenas. The script,\nwhilst a little long, is well written, with\nechoes of Monty Python\u2019s Holy Grail as\nwell as moments of real original com-edy. DramSoc is clearly alive and w ell\nat Imperial, and most important of all,\nit\u2019s got a good sense of humour.\nOf Dice and Men plays tonight and\ntomorrow, Union Concert Hall, \u00a35\nin advance for students, \u00a37 otherwise\nexam the night before.

The new\nAcademic Health Science Partnership\n(AHSP), to be launched in April 2012,\naims to improve the health and care\nof the local population of 1.9 million\npeople.\nThe AHSP will facilitate collaborative approaches between primary, sec-ondary, tertiary, community and mental healthcare providers as well as the\nacademic community at Imperial. For\nexample, there will be greater opportunities to conduct clinical trials at a\nlarge and meaningful scale and to apply research findings to benefit a greater number of patients. The AHSP could\nalso take a leading role in training and\neducating healthcare professionals.\nThe idea of developing the AHSP\nhas been formulated by Professor Lord\nAra Darzi, Head of the Division of\nSurgery at Imperial, and formerly Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State at\nthe Department of Health.\nHe said, \u201cThe partners involved in\ndeveloping the AHSP face many common challenges but have one unifying\ngoal: to bring the highest quality care to\nthe people of North West London. By\nfocusing on our strengths and systematically implementing what is known\nacross the partnership about providing\nthe best clinical care through innova-tion, we should achieve much more\nthan we could apart. Our simple ambition is to use all of our academic and\nclinical expertise to improve the quality of care for our North West London\npopulation as a whole.\u201d\nLord Darzi is to lead a Transitional\nPartnership Board that will confirm the\nmembership of a number of healthcare\nproviders and establish the organisational and legal structure of the AHSP.\nThe Board will also include members\nsuch as Sir Keith O\u2019Nions, Rector of\nImperial, Chief Executives of the NHS\nTrusts and a GP representative.\nO\u2019Nions said, \u201cLord Darzi has developed a convincing vision for achieving\nhigher quality care for patients through\ninnovation, and for strengthening Imperial\u2019s links with healthcare providers across North West London, opening new doors for all. He has achieved\nwidespread support for his proposals\nand I look forward to working with the\nother partners to shape the AHSP.\u201d\nSophia David\nDrop in UCAS applications\nstatements made after initial forecasts in October, saying: \u201cAlthough\nmarginally down on last year, applications to the College look very\nhealthy.

    "content": "BUSINESS\nFELIX\nBusiness Editors: Be\u00f1at Gurrutxaga-Lerma\nNina Kearsey\nbusiness.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFriday 02 december 2011\nAs a result of the so-called \u201cEuro debt crisis\u201d\n\u2013 whose solution seems to be too distant\nstill to be clear \u2013 several of the euro club\ncountries have been bailed out. Starting with\nGreece (2009), Ireland (2010) and Portugal\n(2010) have also been rescued, and in all the\ncases, the process followed a similar pattern.\nAt some point, financial analysts and the\n\u201cmarkets\u201d \u2013 that abstraction which so conveniently hides the fact that they are made up of\npeople \u2013 start questioning the capacity of those\ncountries to honour their debts. How so? Enter the credit rating agencies, whose credibil-ity, severely harmed by the credit crunch, does\nnot prevent them from offering their educated\nopinion on the subject, in the form of the rather\nvulgar recitation: \u201cpublic debt is too high; current deficit is not being adequately tackled;\nhence, we are cutting their credit rating from\nAA\u2013 to BB+ with negative outlook\u2026\u201d\nThis brings in to question the ability of those\ncountries to pay their debt, and panic ensues.\nTheir public debt bonds, which are exchanged\nin secondary markets, become far less attractive than before, and the interest rates investors ask for buying new emissions surge. In no\ntime, these rates have reached such high levels\n(about 7% interest for 10 years bonds is usually thought to be the limit) that it becomes\nunsustainable for those countries to sell their\nbonds on those terms. As a result, the credit rating agencies cut their rating further, and in no\ntime those countries have to be bailed out by\nthe IMF and the European Union.\nAs a spectator, the process seems quite dra-matic. The attention of the media focuses on\npublic finances \u2013 self-styled financial experts\nstart pontificating about their problems, their\neconomies scrutinised and questioned as a\nwhole. A media circus begins, that only precipitates the outcome, and, upon being bailed\nout, they are forced to undertake severe budget\ncuts, which inevitably depress the economy\nfurther, thus forcing them to take even more\nradical measures that necessarily produce further recession: the tragedy has just begun.\nThe arguments analysts and experts usually\noffer are always the same. They will point out\nthe unsustainable amount of public debt with\nrespect to the GDP; then that their governments\nhave failed or have not done enough to reduce\ntheir deficits; that the ongoing economic crisis\nmeans that they are less likely to grow enough\nto pay off their debts; that their economies have\nsevere structural problems that make the long\nterm sustainability of their finances impossible\nunless dramatic reforms are implemented.\nThey will suggest liberalising the labour mar-ket, increasing the retirement age, VAT and\nother taxes, and slashing government spend-ing: \u201cprivatisation, deregulation and liberalisation\u201d, economists\u2019 universal panacea.\nThese arguments seem sensible: offered from\nan expert\u2019s perspective they are by all means\ngood ones. However, the fallacy is that the\nsame arguments offered to question the public\nfinances of Greece, Portugal, Italy, Spain or\nIreland can equally be used to question those of\nmore economically fortunate countries such as\nthe UK, Germany, France, or the USA.\nConsider, for instance, the UK, where public\ndebt amounts to 81% of the GDP. If the total\ndebt is accounted for, i.e. if the foreign debt\ndue to private individuals and companies is in-cluded, the UK\u2019s debt is of 436% of its GDP.\nThat is amongst the highest in the developed\nworld: each UK citizens owes \u20ac117,580 to\nforeigners. Now, compare these figures with\nthose of, say, Spain: public debt, 67% GDP;\ntotal (public+private) debt, 284% GDP; each\nSpaniard owing \u20ac41,366 to foreign investors.\nThe prudent finances of Germany (83% GDP\npublic debt; 176% GDP total debt; each German owes \u20ac50,659 abroad) seem no better than\nthose of the often questioned Italy: 121% GDP\npublic debt; but 163% of total foreign debt, so\nthat each Italian would owe \u20ac32,875 to foreign\ninvestors. France has an 87% GDP public debt,\na 235% GDP total debt, and each French citoyen owes \u20ac66,508 abroad. Among the already\nbailed out countries, Ireland seems by far the\nworst case: 109% GDP public debt, and a staggering 1,093% GDP total debt, with \u20ac390,969\nper capita debt: the Republic of Ireland, with\n4.5 million population, owes as much money as\nthe Kingdom of Spain, with 47 million popula-tion. Greece has 166% GDP public debt, and\n252% GDP total debt, each Greek citizen owing \u20ac38,073 abroad.\nOf course, the economies of Spain, Italy,\nGermany and the UK are not the same, which\nroughly explains why some are so severely\nquestioned and others so mildly treated: it is,\nafter all, a matter of confidence, of whether\ninvestors believe you will be able to honour\nyour debts or not. And that confidence is more\nor less based on the strengths investors may\nsee in each country\u2019s economy. For instance,\nthe UK has a huge financial sector and attracts\nand moves a great deal of capital, which accounts for much of the private debt; as long\nas it does not have to be bailed out by the UK\ngovernment (an impossible deed, looking at\nthe amount it owes), the UK seems to have a\nstrong enough economy to be able to honour its\ndebts. The huge Irish debt is also explained by\nthe amount of foreign companies that, thanks\nto the Irish fiscal dumping system, have their\nEuropean headquarters in the emerald isle; but\nas the housing bubble burst, Irish indebtedness\nwas judged too large. In turn, Spain has suffered a devastating burst of its construction\nand housing bubbles, so although its public\nfinances are by far the best of all the countries\nconsidered, its overall economic situation, with\n20% unemployment rate, doesn\u2019t seem very at-tractive. And Germany\u2019s economy has fared\nso well during the recession, and its fame as a\ncountry that always pays its debts is so well es-tablished, that despite its public finances being\nno better than any others\u2019, it is still regarded as\na safe haven.\nBut, all in all, reasons to fear the long-term\nsustainability of public debt are not that well\nfounded. Consider, for instance, Germany. It\nis quite true that its economy is the strongest\n12\n\u201cI have no more patience for this Europe where Autumn wears the face of Spring and Spring reeks of\nmisery.\u201d So spake Martha in Le Malentendu, Albert\nCamus\u2019s 20th century take on the Greek tragedy,\nOedipus. As the European countries that constitute the Eurozone struggle through their sovereign\ndebt crisis, Martha\u2019s bleak outlook resounds true\nwith the public zeitgeist now, in the 21st century.\nIn the late spring of 2010 Greece became the\nfirst country in the Eurozone to receive a bailout\nfrom the EU and IMF; in the autumn of that year\nIreland too was bailed out; this spring came Portugal, next in cycle of seasons and bailouts. At\nhome a spring marked by freezes to public sector\npay for the next two years has now been followed\nby the announcment in the Chancellor\u2019s Autumn\nStatement that increases after this period will be\ncapped at one per cent, indicating continuing unhappiness for those who have taken to the streets\nin strike this Wednesday.\nWith cuts coming quickly and signs of improvement slowly, predicting the end of this age of\nausterity felt in both the UK and the EU is diffi-cult. Changes to the way things have been done\nup until now will have to take place though; the\nEurozone\u2019s crisis is reaching breaking point. Italian bond yields are beyond the levels that drove\nGreece, Ireland and Portugal to their bailouts, and\nas Italy is simply too big to rescue, the pattern\nof the last few seasons cannot be repeated. The\nsolution favoured by the markets would be to allow\nthe ECB to buy up the bonds of struggling nations\nand issue \u201ceurobonds\u201d, backed by all the Eurozone countries. But with German Chancellor Angela Merkel refusing to move from her stance that\nsolution should come instead from reform and a\ncloser fiscal union, we must try and call on more\npatience, as we wait for the rest of this tragedy to\nplay out.\n\u2013 The Business Editors\nLetter from the Editors\nA Western tragedy\nA seismic map of Europe produced as part of the Global Seismic Hazard Assessment\nProject achieved huge impact in benchmarking the risks of seismic activity across\nborders against a global standard.

A few light\nbeers to get over the journey on the Friday night were followed by an early\nstart on the Saturday where the club\nkitted up into their tight smelly wetsuits\nfor some surfing action.\nThe waves on the Saturday weren\u2019t as\nhuge as the 50ft waves which battered\nthe Devon coast a fortnight before;\nhowever, they did still provide enough\nforce to keep the beginners and (self-claimed) pros happy.\nThe night following the Saturday surf\nsession was arguably one of surfsocs\nfinest to date. Following the initiations\nwhich saw newbies consuming beverages through the surfsoc boot of grief, the\nclub continued to play the usual surfsoc\nmarathon of games. The usual victims\nof the boot never failed to entertain the\ncrowd, with certain committee members\nprowling on innocent newbies in search\nof some early swell white wash for the\nSunday session.\nThe Sunday saw the final surf session\nof the weekend. The waves improved\nin quality becoming less choppy than\nthe previous day, allowing everyone\nto improve on their skills/ faceplant-ing. Some members decided to sit out\nthis session feeling a bit dodge from the\nnight before. After a Sunday roast overlooking the beach, the surfers loaded the\nminibuses and hit the road.\nThe journey back to the grindstone\nwas considerably better with the travel\ntime halved\u2026for the one minibus. The\nsecond bus decided to re-join some\ntraffic, and are due to come back next\nweek\u2026\nThe continued success of surfsoc over\nthe last year has allowed the club to up\nattendances on trips to 28 per trip. With\nsponsorship, and a larger committee the\nclub is continuing to grow and are open\nto any Imperial students joining the\nclub\u2026provided you can swim!\nInterested in surfing?\nSurfsoc welcomes beginner/interme-diate/Kelly slater quality surfers.\nTo be put on the mailing list and learn\nmore about surfsoc simply email:\nsurfsoc@imperial.ac.uk\nAlexander Karvelas\nSurfing\nImperial Surfers\ngo to Devon:\nWestward ho!\nA fine afternoon in Fulham yielded a\nimpressive 4-0 away victory for the Imperial football 7th team against a strong\nHeythrop side whose Kensington location made it as close to a derby game as\nany possible outside Varsity week.\nEquipped with armfuls of food from\nsome of Gloucester Road\u2019s most reputable food outlets, the ever-professional\n7s proceeded to the tube, soon arriving\nat Putney Bridge to meet the rest of the\nplayers. After an accidental and brief\ndetour via the private Hurlingdon Club,\nwhich was met with stern and disdainful looks from the gatekeepers, the pitch\nwas found in nearby Hurlingdon Park.\nThe team quickly found the changing\nroom (whose size suggested it had actually been designed for 18-a-side Aussie\nRules Football) and pulled on the (liter-ally) hole-filled rags which were masquerading as the 7s\u2019 kit for the season.\nThe rare presence of a referee for the\nfirst time in the season was a welcome\none, and he quickly got the game underway with Heythrop losing the toss,\nleaving the 7s to kick off. Talismanic\nleft-winger Ed Lambourn had been\nself-diagnosed with a severe pulmonary\nembolism, and was therefore unavailable to play for the first time this season\n\u2013 a game in which his devastating pace\nwould surely have been useful, against a\ndefence which exhibited about as much\nspeed as a paralysed snail. His placed\nwas filled by Mikkel Kranker, who had\nan excellent match in his first game for\nImperial. The lack of a natural goalkeeper in the squad prompted tough-tackling midfielder James Davies to offer his services between the sticks.\nAfter a largely even start, both teams\nwere pressing and it was Heythrop\nwho came closest with a shot powerfully struck against the post in the first\n10 minutes. Imperial\u2019s three in central\nmidfield seemed to be working, with\nBen Ganesh, Chris Gunasekara and\nSergei Palmer passing with precision\nand tackling with vigour. The referee\u2019s\ndecision not to use linesmen was a poor\none, and lone striker Mo Alsagoff was\ncalled offside a couple of times when\nthe spectators\u2019 opinions suggested oth-erwise.\nThe deadlock was broken on the twenty minute mark, with winger Ephraim\nHaffner-Staton, who had looked dangerous on the right, cutting inside past\ntwo defenders and hitting a powerful\nshot into the bottom left corner past\nthe keeper. Shortly after, an accidental\nkick in the head forced solid centre back\nSteffan Schulz to be substituted for Ross\nMaske, making his first appearance for\nImperial. The injured German had been\none of the team\u2019s most consistent performers so far in the season, with his\ncommanding defensive play alongside\nDom Wood combining smartly with\nsurprising attacking ability in front of\ngoal \u2013 he went into the game with two\ngoals already to his name.\nIt took just a few more minutes for the\nsecond goal to come, with Ben releasing\nEphraim on the right hand edge of the\nbox who took a few touches before finishing coolly with a Robin-van-Persieversus-Norwich-esque chip, his second\nof the game. As the first half came to\nan end, there was time for yet another\ngoal to give Imperial a 3-0 lead into the\nbreak. A through ball from the midfield released Mo who easily outpaced\nthe static Heythrop back line only to be\nmet with the onrushing keeper. A smart\nsidestep to the right and a few subsequent touches left the keeper stranded\nand the delightful chipped cross that\nfollowed allowed Mikkel to fire home\nfrom virtually on the goal-line \u2013 a debut\ngoal for the stand-in left midfielder.\nThe only other incident of the first\nhalf was a rare yellow card for right\nback Duncan, as he committed an excellent foul on a Heythrop midfielder\non the edge of his own box to prevent\nan incisive counter-attack. The two full-backs, captain Alex Meyer-Forsting\n(a.k.a. Major Foreskin) alongside Duncan himself had both been excellent all\ngame, preventing any kind of threat\nfrom materialising down the flanks.\nAny fighting spirit from Heythrop\nwhich had seemed to be absent for most\nof the first half seemed to return at the\nbeginning of the second half, as the\ngame took a more even stance. Winger\nBhavik Bhatt replaced Chris and took up\na left midfield role, with Mikkel moving into the centre. The fourth and final\ngoal came midway through the second\nhalf, as another punishing through ball\ndown the right flank released Mo on\nthe halfway line, who promptly outran\nthe haggard Heythrop defence and fired\nconfidently across the body of the keeper low into the corner of the net \u2013 his\nthird of the season.\nFor the final ten minutes, Sergei took\nup position in goal, allowing James to\ninject some of his tough-tackling and\nenthusiasm into the centre of midfield.\nAfter being unsure of his own ability\nin goal, James had looked every bit the\nprofessional keeper, with a confident\nperformance. The only incident in the\nlast few minutes was a penalty for Imperial being waved away by the referee\nafter talking to Ben, who proved the 7s\u2019\nsportsmanship, even though a penalty\nwould surely have led to a fifth goal.\nSoon after, the final whistle blew, signalling celebrations from Imperial to\naccompany their most convincing result\nof the season. Ephraim was given man\nof match after his sterling performance,\nwhich had resulted in two goals for the\nright winger. With performances like\nthis, the 7s are sure to quickly rise up\nthe table \u2013 form which could not have\ncome at a better time, as more challenging matches lie in the weeks to come.\nEd Lambourn\nFootball\nMen\u2019s 3rd 2\nSussex 2nd 1\nDarren Ambrose, eat your heart out\nEverybody goes surfin\u2019, surfin\u2019 Devonshire (set to the tune of the Beach\nBoys song.

Simple question; it\u2019s a\n\u2018yes or no\u2019 question. To make it through the iCU Cinema All-Nighter, you\u2019re going to need to sit back and\nenjoy over 12 hours of the latest films. Does that\nsound like something you can do, Imperial?\nSimply put, the All-Nighter is six of the latest films\nback-to-back on one spectacular night of cinema,\ncaffeine, and tub after tub of Pot Noodle. It\u2019s a cinematic journey that begins with Johnny English Reborn. Don\u2019t scoff, a friend of mine works at Vertigo,\nthe production company that makes Johnny English;\nit\u2019s basically one of the most profitable truly-British\nfilms in recent history.\nThen we have Drive, the stylish action/thriller starring \u201cOH MY GOD HE\u2019S SO HOT\u201d Ryan Gosling (don\u2019t\ntell my mother I wrote that\u2026)\nAfter this? Real Steel. Hugh Jackman acts alongside some robots. Or something.\nThen we have Paul. Like all Edgar Wright & Co\nfilms, Paul is hilarious and intelligent, unlike oh so\nmany Hollywood stoner flicks. It\u2019s a true tribute to\nthe science fiction genre and you\u2019d be mad to miss\nit. To run down the night we\u2019ve got style, action and\ngood old troll whacking.\nFirst we\u2019re straight into Contagion, a film about\na global pandemic that\u2019s genuinely described as\na \u201cmedical thriller\u201d. You can imagine the pitch for\nthis film: \u201cWhat if, like, fear\u2026 yeah? Spreads faster,\nyeah? Than the, like, virus?\u201d I\u2019m probably being too\ncynical, Rotten Tomatoes gives this film 84%. Then\nfinally ending the night we have Troll Hunter.

However, the story for The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn \u2013 Part 1 is getting slightly ridiculous\n\u2013 Bella gets pregnant with a vampire-human\nhybrid that rips its way out dramatically \u2013 and\neven director Bill Condon and his ace team\ncan\u2019t make it perfect.\nHaving said that, while the filmmakers\nhave taken a lot of flack about their choice to\ntake what has been dubbed the \u2018Harry Potter\ngameplan\u2019 and splitting the final novel into\ntwo films, when it comes to profits the decision was a definite win for the backers. The\nthree-day opening here in the UK bagged a\nrather impressive \u00a313.91m, and is expected to\ngo straight to the top of the UK Box Office\nchart, having shot to the top of the USA\u2019s with\na whopping first weekend take of $138m.\nThe story follows on from the previous Twilight Saga films; after a beautiful wedding,\nEdward Cullen (Robert Pattinson) and Bella\nSwan (Kristen Stewart) set off on a romantic\nhoneymoon to Brazil. However, the trip is cut\nshort when Bella discovers she is pregnant with\na half-vampire half-human baby, which is fast\nmutating and crushing her weak human body.\nTo add to the problem, when they get home\nthere are a few pretty angry werewolves who\nare really not keen on the arrival of this mutant\nchild waiting on their doorstep. Can Bella\u2019s\nwerewolf friend Jacob (Taylor Lautner) help\nsort things out? And how will Bella and Edward cope with their new species of child?\nThe acting is as it always has been \u2013 fine, but\nhampered by a rather miserable script. A reasonable supporting cast is held up by Pattinson\nstill credibly portraying hurt soul Edward, but\nwhile the intensity between him and Stewart\nis genuinely convincing, for a teen flick there\nare very moody faces all round. Even in the\nrare moments of attempted humour, the actors can\u2019t seem to get it across. Lautner does\na good job with angry, angsty Jacob, but even\nhe has his moments of childish tantrums and\nstorming off. Nevertheless, the whole cast do\na good job, and it is clear that a lot of effort\nhas gone into pushing the mood of the film towards \u2018dark and disturbing\u2019 in the set-up for\nthe final part.\nIf you watch Breaking Dawn Part 1 as a prequel to the total hell that is about to break loose\nin part two (you know what I mean if you\u2019ve\nread the book, Twihards) then it\u2019s ok. But if it\nis viewed as a stand-alone film, the unnecessarily slow pace and extended length of the film\ncan make it a bit dull. There\u2019s enough to keep it\nall moving along, especially in the second half,\nand there is a lot of tension created by heartbroken Jacob\u2019s doubts, torn desperately as he\nis between love and vengeance. But there is a\nserious lack of fight scenes and action, other\nthan the threatening pack of werewolves who\nreally only remain on the periphery. The only\nminor action shows the wolves leaping a bit as\nthe vampires move really fast, which gets a bit\ntedious after a while.\nPossibly the best thing about this film is the\neffect it\u2019s having on men across the world. As\nmentioned, the film portrays Bella\u2019s difficult\npregnancy as she carries the child of her vampire husband, culminating in a graphic scene\nof the baby\u2019s birth. Viewer Brandon Gephart,\nfrom Roseville, California, was reportedly\ntaken to hospital after suffering what seemed\nto be a panic attack during the birthing cli-max. \u201cHe was convulsing, snorting, trying to\nbreathe,\u201d said his girlfriend Kelly Bauman.\nThat particular screening had to end early\nwhen the paramedics arrived. Other cases of\nmen freaking out have been recorded, such as\nan unnamed man from Utah (as reported by\nABC4) who also had some sort of seizure during the same scene. \u201cI didn\u2019t really remember\nwhat happened,\u201d the man told the news crew.\n\u201cI think I blacked out. According to [my wife]\nI was shaking and mumbling different noises.\u201d\nThe ending naturally gears us up for the final part of the Twilight Saga, and \u2013 alongside a\nsneaky mid-credits teaser \u2013 sets the stage for a\nvery different Bella and the battle for her new\nfamily\u2019s safety in 2012\u2019s concluding install-ment. All in all, despite the Rotten Tomatoes\nrating of just 28%, this is a reasonably enjoy-able, easy film to watch \u2013 one to drag your\nboyfriend to\u2026 unless he\u2019s squeamish about\npregnancy.\nCure for teen pregnancy\nLucy Wiles\nDirector Bill Condon\nScreenwriters Melissa Rosenberg,\nStephanie Meyers (novel)\nCast Robert Pattinson, Kristen Stewart,\nTaylor Lautner\nThe Twilight Saga - Breaking\nDawn Part 1\n\u201cEdward, I\u2019m pregnant...\u201d \u201cBella, I\u2019m leaving you...\u201d\n\n"

Unfortunately no one on\ncampus can tell you where RAG is based,\nand very few have even heard of them.You\nregroup in the JCR to plan strategy.\nAries\nThis week you snort a line of coke,\npick up your son from his father\u2019s\nhouse and get on a tram in Croydon.\nYou decide to start airing your\nconcerns about demographic changes\nin South London. Turns out your\nviews are unpopular.\nTaurus\nYou\u2019re a medical student. After watching\na morbidly obese patient die of a heart\nattack: surrounded by strangers and\nshitting themselves; you realise that you\nhate humanity. Upon expressing this belief,\nall the qualified doctors burst into applause\nand you\u2019re handed your degree on the spot.\nGemini\nThis week you are required to write\na circular email to the Imperial College RAG committee, as an opening\ngambit you decide to start airing your\nviews on the comedic merit of a university publication. Turns out your\nviews are unpopular.\nCancer\nThis week you go on strike. Your pension is being sold down the river, which\nis completely outrageous because it\u2019s not\nyour fault that the world economy is down\nthe shitter. Unfortunately, but unsurpris-ingly, the strike achieves nothing. Politicians inexplicably call you Greedy.\nLeo\nThis week you\u2019re doing bong hits with Eliza Manningham-Buller outside of Queen\u2019s\ntower when Keith O\u2019nions rocks up and\nstarts getting all whingy about respectability and bullshit like that. Just when you\nthought your high had been crushed for-ever, Prof. Nutt turns up with his special\ncookies and everyone mellows back out.\nVirgo\nThis week you decided to write for Felix. Tentatively opening the office door\nyou can\u2019t help but scream at the sight\nof skin-blanched malnourished urchins\nslumped at computer desks. \u201cNews?!\nFrom the Outside?!\u201d croaks what looks\nlike the ring leader, blinking in the unfamiliar light. They make you their king.\nLibra\nThis week you\u2019re a blade of grass in the\nunion quad, gently photosynthesising in\nthe crisp, winter sunlight when BOOM:\nan investment bank put up a massive\ninflatable portable recruitment bouncy\ncastle on you. Still, better than what\nthose dicks at sports night pour on you.\nSagittarius\nThisweekyourgirlfrienddoesn\u2019tloveyou\nanymore. Unfortunately, girlfriend is the\nname you gave the programme you made\nfor your computing coursework, designed\nto send you banal, cute small-talk filled\ntext messages at 2 hourly intervals. To add\nto your broken heart, you get a 2:2.\nCapricorn\nThis week you decide to lead your Felix\nArmy on a campaign to conquer IC Radio.\nHowever, when you get there, you find\nthe station manager being bundled into a\npolice van and the Union President in what\nappears to be a Stasi uniform setting alight\nto their server. FoiledAgain!\nAquarius\nThis week, in a fit of loneliness you buy a\nhamster. You very quickly realise that the\ncompanionship derived from a creature\nthat primarily just eats and shits a lot isn\u2019t\nhuge. You decide to name him Virginity\nand deliberately lose him.

The\nperfect antidote to ignorance for the lazy.\nThis book concisely addresses the existential crisis of the main\ncharacter \u2013 a dog that has had to live and cope with a congenital\nskin defect that has ended up defining him. The story starts with\nrebellion against his oppressors, who force his \u201cdinner\u201d upon\nhim. In response, Spot goes into hiding, fearing for his life. Eric\nHill\u2019s portrayal of this one dog\u2019s struggle is powerful in its graphic\ndetail of the various places his owners seach for him in, keeping\nthe reader on edge whenever a cupboard is opened. How long will\nSpot stay one step ahead? What is Spot willing to do in order to\nescape? And if he gets caught, what will he have for dinner?\nDespite the gripping narrative, at 24 pages there is little room for\nplot development, leaving many plot holes unanswered \u2013 such as\nthe cover: the protagonist is clearly looking for something despite\nthe story hinging around the search for Spot.\nStuff Imperial students hate\nMen\nGod, you are all so unattractive. None of you seem\nto give a damn about your appearance. Your wardrobe consists of two hoodies, two pairs of jeans/\ntrousers, four t-shirts and maybe one long-sleeved\nshirt for when you want to impress the ladies at the\nUnion. Except, once you get there, you just stare\ncreepily at them because you\u2019re too damn scared\nto say anything to them. You\u2019ve made it through\nschool scoring straight A\u2019s, so you\u2019re so bloody\nscared of failure that you will go out of your way to\navoid eye contact with the girl you like at the bar.\nThat time you got rejected from Oxford was almost\ntoo much to handle \u2013 if you ever fail again you will\nprobably die.\nWomen\n\u201cOoh, look at me!

My Week with\nMarilyn, as its title may suggest, only\nexplores a brief section of the icon\u2019s\nlife, but since she has accomplished\nso much, even the smallest slice in her\nshowbiz-surrounded life is full of fun,\nromance and charm which is exactly\nwhat the film offers.\nThe Prince and the Showgirl, shot in\nEngland, (in)famously united Monroe\n(Michelle Williams) and Sir Laurence\nOlivier (Kenneth Branagh), where the\nproduction was plagued with delays,\nmiscommunication, and great discontent from Olivier, as he was far from\nimpressed with Monroe\u2019s notoriously\nerratic behaviour on set that included\ntardiness, alcoholism and drug use.\nWhilst My Week with Marilyn does\nfocus on the filming aspect, caught in\nthe middle of this is in fact Colin Clark\n(Eddie Redmayne), the third assistant\ndirector, whose job is to do all the grunt\nwork. Captivated by Monroe even before her arrival in London, Clark\u2019s boyish enthusiasm and warm personality\nbring the two close together. Trapped\nin a less than satisfactory marriage to\nArthur Miller (Dougray Scott), Monroe finds comfort and solace in Clark\u2019s\narms.\nMilton Greene (Dominic Cooper),\nMarilyn\u2019s business partner, warns Clark\nto not get involved: \u201cShe breaks hearts,\nshe will break yours too.\u201d But what\nthey share has very little to do with sex\nor lust. It\u2019s a strong friendship built on\ntrust, with the occasional moments of\npassion that build up from spending so\nmuch time together. Although there is\nunavoidable tragedy lurking around the\ncorner, director Simon Curtis makes\nsure the atmosphere is always light\nenough and the breezy script supports\nthis. As the infatuated Colin, Redmayne\nis a wholly likable central character,\nwith his wide-eyed, somewhat childish\nfascination towards everything that is\ngoing on around him. He is a tall, handsome actor with immense appeal, with\nenough cheek and confidence that he\nconvincingly adds to his initially clueless character.\nSuccess brings luxury, fame and infinite love from crowds, but for a price.\nThe pressure she faces in Pinewood\nStudios starts to build up. Despite her\nacting coach Paula Strasberg\u2019s (Zo\u00eb\nWanamaker) supportive words, Marilyn finds her confidence shaken every\ntime she stumbles on a line, further\ninfuriating the already heated Olivier.\nDame Sybil Thorndike (Judi Dench), is\nmore understanding, and as a woman of\nprinciple and disciplined manner, she\nexudes warmth as well as firm maternal\npresence to anyone who unreasonably\ncrosses the line.\nNo words can describe just how superb Williams is in the role of Monroe. She has the looks, the voice, the\nswagger, and the sassiness, but there\nis something so much more to her portrayal than what is visible on the sur-face. The behind-the-scenes Marilyn,\nthe insecure, vulnerable and troubled\nsuperstar longing to be taken seriously,\nto be loved, and not quite ready to cope\nwith all the uncomfortable sides the\nglitzy Hollywood life brings with it,\nWilliams makes sure that Monroe is a\nhuman being after all, and that she is\nsomeone worth caring about. But she\u2019s\nnot all about the depressed Marilyn, as\nwhen her character gets her vibrant en-ergy, she is delightfully glamorous.\nAs for the invaluable supporting play-ers, Cooper\u2019s wonky American accent\naside, everyone stands strong in their\nroles, with two of the greatest English\nactors, Branagh and Dench, living up to\ntheir usual high standards. Wanamaker,\nas Marilyn\u2019s coach who wants what\nis best for her most talented student,\nis stubborn and relentless, clashing\nwith Olivier regarding Marilyn\u2019s acting style. She believes in method act-ing, he doesn\u2019t. Emma Watson, in her\nfirst post-Potter role, has an interesting\nrole of Colin\u2019s could-be girlfriend, and\nthe two share a warm enough chemistry to show the audience a glimpse of\npossibility that Colin may be better\noff settling down for someone more to\nhis standard. Although looking nothing like the wife of Laurence Olivier,\nJulia Ormond does an admirable job as\nVivien Leigh, in a crucial scene that she\nhints at her jealousy towards the much\nyounger, sought-after Marilyn.\nIt\u2019s a light trek that gives us plenty\nof insight into the complicated life of\nMarilyn Monroe. We will never know\nthe full extent of just how frightened\nshe was of failing those around her,\nand just how lonely and isolated she\nmust have felt. The film tries to show as\nmany variations as possible, which can\nlead to quite a few repetitions. Marilyn\nis troubled, she calls for Colin\u2019s help,\nhe comes, calms her down, and she\nfeels better. It\u2019s a routine that is both\npredictable and slightly tiresome after\na while, but it\u2019s a film to watch simply\nfor the flawless performances. Nominations should be flooding in towards\nthe end of this year for Williams, and\nrightly so.\nJohn Park\nDirector Simon Curtis\nScreenwriters Adrian Hodges, Colin\nClark (novel)\nCast Michelle Williams, Eddie\nRedmayne, Kenneth Branagh, Judi\nDench, Dominic Cooper, Emma\nWatson\nMy Week with Marilyn\n\n"

What does Cathedral City Cheese have\ndifferent from other cheese brands?\nM: All of the cheese used for Cathedral City is\nmade at the award winning Davidstow Creamery on the north Cornish coast. The meadows\nare lush and the milk is creamy. All these factors combine to deliver a highly consistent\nproduct with a wonderful flavour profile.\nA: I\u2019ve read that you often grade 500 cheese\nsamples a day. If I ask you to choose the best\ncheese product that you have ever tasted,\nwhich one would it be?\nM: It is correct that on a busy day I can grade\nin the region of 500 samples. Davidstow is a\nlarge producer by any measure and there are a\nlot of cheese to be assessed. My two favourite\ncheeses are Cathedral City Vintage-20 and a\nnice gooey, cabbage smelling Brie.\nA: What knowledge and skills are needed to\nbe a cheese grader?\nM: First the ability to taste accurately and con-sistently, secondly a good understanding of the\nmanufacturing process, thirdly focus and con-centration, and finally a thick skin if you need\nto reject product.\nA: Do you enjoy your job?

When it\ncomes in a re-closeable pack then keep it in that\npack, If not ideal tightly wrap in grease proof\npaper rather than cling film (it can go sweaty)\nand finally take out of the fridge approx 15\nmins before use if not for cooking.\nA: Is Cathedral City currently in the process\nof producing a new product?\nM: We have just launched the kids snacks\n\u2018Chedds\u2019which was a big project launch for us.\nIn recent years there has been our Mild, Lighter\nand Vintage-20 cheeses and, yes, there will be\nmore to come.

    "content": "MUSIC\nKadhim\u2019s totally hot\nalbum of the week\nYouth Lagoon\nThe Year of\nHibernation\nLefse Records\n2011\nOn Sunday, I was at a friend-of-a-friend\u2019s flat; it\nwas almost completely burnt out. The TV had\ncaught fire and the ensuing blaze had torn up the\nwalls and slithered around the rooms, turning\nhome into hell. Some things had survived: a coating of soot was all the happy family photos had to\nendure. Other things had been less lucky: a grand\nfull-length mirror had been warped to destruction by the heat and the once-intricate frame was\ncharred and black. I said to him, rather stupidly, \u201cit\nfeels like it was a really nice place\u201d. He was kind\nenough to be patient with me and replied, simply,\n\u201cyeah, it was\u2026\u201d\nWhen I returned home that evening, to my conspicuously uncharred flat, I listened to Youth Lagoon\u2019s debut album, The Year of Hibernation, and\nfelt transported back to those dark, ash-ridden\nrooms. I imagined sitting on the miraculously undamaged green leather sofa and thought about\nthe destruction brought into his home; the place\nwhere we find solace and warmth eaten up by\nflames and smoke.\nBut, more striking than that was the sense of\noptimism. Youth Lagoon (a.k.a. Trevor Powers,\nof Idaho disposition) doesn\u2019t paint a story of de-spair. The wistful guitar melodies, ghostly vocals,\nmisty piano keys, and discreet beats (file next to\nWashed Out and Wild Nothing) speak of a rebirth,\nof a phoenix rising from the ashes. Which brings\nme nicely to why I spent my Sunday in a burnt-out flat: the friend-of-a-friend had decided to do a\nphoto-shoot in the charred remains of his life, and\nneeded some extra hands. There can be no doubt\nthat if life is going to hand you heartache, there\u2019s\nno truer response than to try to make something\nbeautiful from it.\nMy reputation as \u201can extra pair of hands\u201d is unim-peachable. If you want to make use of my hands,\ntweet @kadhimshubber and give me a time, place,\nand bag of Haribo Starmix. Better still, tweet @\nYouthLagoon and tell him his music is \u201ctoo obscure\nand pretentious\u201d, and probably \u201ctoo underground to\nbe of use to anyone\u201d.\nAn essential classic for any music lover, says Clare Cheng\nOrigin of Symmetry\nB\nack in 2001; the year iTunes was\nborn, J-Lo got her first UK number 1 single and George Bush\nbegan his war on terror, Muse\nreleased the amazingly beautiful\nalbum that is Origin of Symmetry. Although\nthis was the Devonshire band\u2019s second album\nafter Showbiz, it was the collection of songs\nthat marked the greatness that was to come.\nTo celebrate this momentous occasion the\nband played the album in full at this year\u2019s\nReading and Leeds Festival. The stage was\ndecked out with colossal forks as seen on the\nalbum artwork, with Matt Bellamy\u2019s glass piano taking pride of place.\nTheir set was the best, hands down, all week-end; the opening song \u2018New Born\u2019 being accompanied by flying saucers hurtling across\nthe screen, launching huge inflatable eyeballs\ninto the crowd that burst to release confetti, and\nshooting fireworks that exploded high above\nthe stage\u2026 oh and not to mention the songs\nwere pretty spectacular too.\nWhat makes Origin of Symmetry so different,\ntimeless even, is that it appeals to every music\nlistener. Even my Dad, who loves his classical and jazz, likes listening to Muse rocking it\nout. The strong bass chords allow the guitar to\nexpand and explore, but still remain restrained\nenough so as not to scare away the not-so-die-hard rock fans.\nMatt\u2019s voice somehow manages to infiltrate every cell of the body, being familiar and\nwarming, but at the same time sending a tingle\ndown the spine that leaves us wanting more.\nHis voice makes him the David Attenborough\nof music.\nMatt and his fellow band members even manage to pull off a cover of Nina Simone\u2019s \u2018Feeling Good\u2019 in this album \u2013 such a classic made\npushing up the heart rate one minute, but then\nmellowing it down the next. Each song has\nsuch feeling and emotion woven into it.\nWhen I listen to the album I am taken on a\nrollercoaster ride of different emotions. \u2018Bliss\u2019\nfills me with such warmth, it makes me smile;\n\u2018Space Dementia\u2019 and \u2018Plug In Baby\u2019 bring up\ndeep feelings \u2013 sadness, passion, joy. These\nsongs make me want to sing my heart out. They\nare able to spell out my emotions when I have\nno words to explain them.\nSome critics consider the songs \u2018Dark Shines\u2019\nand \u2018Screenager\u2019to be downsides of the album,\nperhaps reflections of the early stage in Muse\u2019s\ncareer. However, as a die-hard Muse fan I could\ntell them to sod off. But I\u2019ll show some restraint\nand argue that these tracks still reflect the complexities in their repertoire. Although really\nquite different from earlier songs in the album,\nthey still have the same punch of emotion and\nmusical brilliance: the trademark of Muse.\nThis is what makes not only the album but the\nband themselves an essential for any music lover\u2019s collection. I mean, this is what they were\nproducing when they first started out \u2013 imagine\nhow amazing they are now.\neven better.\nTo be honest, if I need to remind/convince\nyou anymore of how amazing Muse is then\nthere is no point in you having ears to hear with.\nThe album begins with \u2018New Born\u2019 \u2013 the\ngentle building of the piano, the low hum of the\nbass and Matt\u2019s gentle voice all lull the listener\ninto a false sense of security. But then the real\nfun begins as the guitar chords let rip, after a\npause for anticipation. It\u2019s a fantastic opener,\nsetting the tone for the ambitious tunes to come.\nHowever, do not be deceived; this is not all\nthey do.

    "content": "COMMENT\nComment Editors: Tim Arbabzadah\nSam Horti\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nI\nf you\u2019ve been paying attention\nto the goings on in America in\nthe lead up to next year\u2019s presidential elections, you will no\ndoubt have heard many political commentators expressing the view\nthat Ron Paul is the man that everyone\nhas been waiting for. The hero that\nAmerica needs. What is especially impressive is that this type of praise is\nhappening across the board, regardless\nof political loyalties or emotional ties.\nNow, I\u2019m not going to tell you\nRon Paul is a bad presidential can-didate. He, in contrast with many in\nthe American political system, is very\nhonest, consistent and forthright with\nhis views. I would whole-heartedly\nagree with him on many of his political positions, such as his desire\nto abolish the income tax (and lower\ntaxes in general), and to end the \u201cWar\non Drugs\u201d.\nBest of all, he is a Libertarian who\nwants to reduce the size of the government and decentralise power, something that seems to me, at least in prin-ciple, a very good thing. Although not\nmuch of an achievement, he is by far\nand away the best Republican candi-date, and seems to be the most viable\nalternative to another 4 years of Mr\nObama. However, as you can probably\ntell from the title of this article, I find\nthat Ron Paul\u2019s ideas are fraught with\npractical problems to their very core.\nSome of his more ludicrous views,\nsuch as his non-belief in both evolution and the separation in Church and\nState, are regrettable for a man of his\nintelligence, but their importance is\nnegated by the fact that Mr Paul won\u2019t\nimpose his beliefs on the American\npeople. This, somewhat ironically, is\nwhere the main problem lies.\nEssentially, Ron Paul wants decisions to be increasingly made at a\nstate level. Whilst this means, thank-fully, that his more ridiculous opinions\nwill not translate themselves into law,\nit worryingly puts power in the hands\nof the American people. \u201cBut surely,\u201d\nI hear you cry, \u201cmore power to the\npeople is a good thing, right?\u201d This is\nthe point at which the problems of democracy rear their ugly heads.\nAnyone who advocates individual\nliberty (as Ron Paul does) must immediately sense a problem when\nconfronted with a democratic sys-tem. Democracy and Libertarianism,\nin my mind, are complete polar op-posites, which are incompatible with\none another. Libertarianism, admira-bly, wants power to be given to the\nindividual, whereas democracy wants\npower to be given to the majority. The\nlatter establishes a mob-rule mental-ity, where 51% of the people can completely abolish the rights of the other\n49%.\nThis is the reason that Ron Paul\u2019s\nAmerica is doomed to fail. In an attempt to liberate individual Americans, Ron Paul will no doubt suppress\nthe freedom of minorities in many\nparts the United States. In more reasonable areas, where the voters are\nwell educated and have developed a\ngood understanding of the purpose of\nsociety, there will not be many major\nproblems. I cannot imagine, for exam-ple, there being any problem with the\nissue gay rights in the state of Massachusetts. However, it is when you\nexamine some of the more bigoted\nstates, particularly those inhabited by\nswathes of evangelical Christians, that\nyou recognise the social problems that\nRon Paul\u2019s policies (or, to be more\nprecise, his non-policies) may cause.\nWhat hope, for example, is there\nfor the individual liberty of a Texan\nwoman wishing to have an abortion,\nliving in a state where the governor,\nRick Perry, is allowed to use tax payers money to fund mass prayer events,\nlike one he organised to pray for a halt\nAmerica\u2019s national decline (whatever\nhappened to the First Amendment?).\nWhat hope is there for the liberty of\nLet\u2019s talk about Ron Paul\nSamuel Horti\nWould you have known if we had just put a picture of a random guy that wasn\u2019t Ron Paul?\nDon\u2019t worry, this is Ron Paul. Honestly. Or is it? It is\nFollowing the sudden impact of the first\nwave of student protests last year, this\nweek\u2019s pension protests almost seem\npart of a natural occurrence, but one,\nnonetheless, that continues to demonstrate the ever-changing nature of political activism. Imperial, however, remains\nan anomaly amongst institutions as protests continue on (as demonstrated by\nlimited campus action on Wednesday).\nThis is by no means a negative aspect.\nIf there is one area of life at Imperial\nCollege that separates us from a number\nof other universities, it is the neutrality\nof our Student Union. The refusal of the\nsabbatical officers to break ultra vires\nmeans that, at least for the immediate\nfuture, we will not see them protesting\nin central London alongside their counterparts from other universities, such as\nUniversity College London. If anything,\nofficers would be representing only a\nportion of students\u2019 views should they at-tend. They are, in a way, politicians rather\nactivists.\nAs a scientific institution, Imperial\nprides itself on the search for answers\nto difficult questions through considered\nevidence and an avoidance, where pos-sible, of bias. If our Union actively followed one particular political viewpoint,\nit would provide an opposing message to\nthe aims of the College.\nFor those who believe that a more\npolitically active Union would lead to a\nmore politically active student body, they\nwould be mistaken. As the student body\nis largely inactive when it comes to activism of their own accord, suggestions\nfrom student representatives would be\nequally likely to fall on deaf ears.\nThe fact that our Union does not, for\nthe most part, take a particular political standpoint is something that should\nbe praised rather than ridiculed. If any-thing, a far greater number of students\nare likely to stand behind a Union that is\nneutral and caters to as large a group of\nstudents as possible. Such a situation,\nas it stands at the moment, in no way\nhinders the potential for the individual\nstudent to organise a group to protest for\ntheir own political view.\nSome may argue that they do not represent the student viewpoint, but the neutrality instead provides a blank slate that\ncan be written on by the individual, rather\nthan the result of dictation by a higher\nauthority. We should not decry our apoliti-cism, but instead embrace the measured\nthinking and opinion that we are open to.\na homosexual couple living in the\nstate of Tennessee, where a recent bill,\nwhich has passed Senate clearance,\nwill \u201cprohibit teachers from discussing\nhomosexuality in kindergarten through\neighth-grade classrooms?\u201d These instances of asinine stupidity are by no\nmeans isolated, as those of you who\nkeep up with American politics will\nno doubt know. The emergence of discriminatory pieces of legislature seems\nto happen all too regularly.\nWhen Democracy and stupidity\ncome together, nothing positive ever\ngets done. It is an unfortunate fact that\nRon Paul wishes to divulge powers to\npeople that are far more bigoted than\nhe is. As a man who has garnered respect from all corners of his country,\nRon Paul could do so much for the\nfreedom of individual Americans. As\nit is, his ideas are trapped inside a\ndemocratic system which, when combined with inevitably self-centred vot-ers, gives us a situation in which the\nmajority are encouraged to do as they\nplease, no matter what the effects on\nothers might be. Libertarianism can\nnever prevail in a Democratic system.\nFELIX\nImperial is unique\nrather than active\nFELIX\n14 Friday 02 december 2011\nWhy Liberty and Democracy don\u2019t mix\n\u201d\nAnyone who\nadvocates individual\nliberty... must\nimmediately sense\na problem when\nconfronted with a\ndemocratic system\n\u201c\nAnyone w\nAnyone w\nadvocate\nadvocate\nIs shouting\nat people in\nreal life too\nmuch social\ninteraction\nfor you?\nWell, you\ncan shout in\nword form\non:\nfelixonline.\nco.uk\n\n"

    "content": "GAMES\nGames Editor: Laurence Pope\ngames.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFriday 02 december 2011 FELIX\n30 FELIX\nSmack it down to the\nground, WWE style\nEdward Bals tackles THQ\u2019s latest professional wrestling game, WWE \u201812\n\u201cThe vast customisation\noptions in WWE \u201812\nreally give the game\na unique touch; you\ncan create your own\ncharacter from scratch\u201d\nI took him, and threw him on the GROUND\n\u201cTo mimic real life pre-wrestling this game\nhas backstage fights,\npromos and even\nscripted events in the\nmiddle of matches\u201d\nT\nHQ promised that WWE \u201812\nwould be the game to reinvent\ntheir tired series, and it seems that\nwith this new entry they have suc-ceeded, at least in part. This is a\ngame which recreates the almost absurd dramatics and stage-play that wrestling is famous\nfor: from The Undertaker\u2019s chilling entrance\nto some of the, sometimes hilarious, match\nmodes.\nThe \u2018campaign\u2019 within WWE \u201812 is the\n\u2018Road to Wrestlemania\u2019 which puts you in the\nshoes of three different characters: Sheamus\n(the villain); Triple H (the outsider) and Jacob\nCass (the player-created rookie wrestler). The\nRoad to Wrestlemania occupies a fairly sizable\nchunk of the game (roughly twelve hours) but\nit is at times frustrating. To mimic real life pro-wrestling this game mode has backstage fights,\npromos and even scripted events in the middle\nof matches. These scripted events can often be\nthe most frustrating element of this mode as\nquite often I found myself fruitlessly trying to\npin an opponent, when all that was required\nwas a contextual button press.\nGripes about Road to Wrestlemania aside,\nthe other single player mode, WWE universe,\nshould provide many hours of enjoyment. This\nmode provides a section of the game without\na story, allowing the matches to be shown in\na calendar format allowing almost complete\ncustomisation and allowing for what the game\nshould be mainly about (the wrestling) to\ncome to the fore. Feuds and alliances will be\nformed in this mode and should keep you coming back for more.\nThe multiplayer mode is great fun as playing against a human opponent is much more\nenjoyable than competing against the AI opponents in WWE \u201812. When against the AI the\ndifficulty occasionally spikes with the only\nreason seemingly being to punish the player\nfor having become better at the game. However, the AI can be easily tweaked using a\nlarge range of customisation options. Competing against a human opponent is still the best\nexperience for a match in WWE \u201812, and the\nalmost lag-free online multiplayer makes it\neven easier to enjoy this.\nIn terms of controls the game is very easy\nto pick up with its intuitive control system.\nThe A button is used to grapple, B is used for\npunches, kicks, Irish whips and pins, whilst\nthe Y button controls the wrestler\u2019s signature\nand finishing moves. The game also supplies\nbutton prompts for countering moves but these\nflitter onto and off the screen at such a speed\nthat the countering system is somewhat down\nto chance, unless you have lightning-fast re-flexes. The ability to target specific limbs is\nalso a welcome addition as it adds an almost\ntactical and strategic feel to the gameplay.\nThe customisation options in WWE \u201812 are\nvast. You can create your own character from\nscratch, altering their appearance, entrance,\nmove set and finishing move. There is also\nan option for creating your own arena for use\nin the game. These customisation options really give the game a unique touch when you\nwatch your wrestler come on using their own\nentrance rather than a stock one.\nAs a complete package WWE \u201812 is worth\nyour time. The impressive customisation op-tions, the large roster of over 60 characters\nand the solid core gameplay make this game a\ntempting package for anyone with the slightest\ninterest in wrestling.\n(A return) to Web Games\nYou call it stealing, I call it a tribute. This week, and\nthis week only (maybe...) we\u2019re going to offer you\nup two totally awesome web games that you can\nplay right now in your web browser. In order to enjoy\nthese you\u2019re going to need the Adobe Flash Player\nplug-in which can be installed from\nhttp://get.adobe.com/flashplayer/\nTop Defense\nhttp://www.newgrounds.com/portal/\nview/573681\nDon\u2019t you just hate it when you awaken from artificial\nhibernation to find yourself as the only survivor on a\nmilitary starship, immediately tasked with defending\nan entire planet?\nTop Defence is a tower-defence game, only without\nthe towers. You have a variety of upgradable weapons to manually attack the invading forces with,\nincluding your basic missile strike, a slowdown effect thingy and an armour-eating nano-cloud. Choosing what to upgrade with your limited \u2018energy\u2019 (the\ngame\u2019s upgrade points) is a challenge, and will certainly keep you from that piece of coursework due in\nat 2pm today.\nOh yeah, and the music\u2019s pretty boss as well.\nCulmination\nhttp://www.newgrounds.com/portal/\nview/584398\nCulmination is more an art-piece than a game. The\nmusic is both beautiful and calming, the art design\npure and simple. You play as the double-jumping\nfallen Hero of the Earth, seeking revenge against his\nKing.\nThe combat is sword-based, easy to pick up and\nfun to use. As you rack up more strikes on enemies\nyou temporarily gain more advanced strikes, culminating in an attack that demolishes all on screen. Go\nplay it now, you won\u2019t be disappointed.\n\n"

A mammoth US$905 million (\u00a3523 mil-lion) was raised by the university\u2019s colleges and\nUS$1.1 billion (\u00a3649 million) was raised by the\nuniversity itself. This 10 year campaign to raise\nmoney had its most successful year between\n2010-2011 when they raised US$215 million\n(\u00a3135 million).\nVice-Chancellor Professor Sir Leszek Borysiewicz said that the university and colleges were\n\u201cimmensely grateful\u201d to their donors, out of which\na massive 54,000 are alumni who have contributed to colleges and 8000 of them to the university.\nThe US$640 million (\u00a3390 million) of legacy\npledges mean that more benefactions will have\nbeen created in the future. Bill Janeway, CoChairman of the Campaign Board and Senior Advisor to Warburg Pincus said \u201cthe case for philanthropy and fundraising to support Britain\u2019s great\nuniversities has never been stronger\u201d. Fellow CoChairman and Senior Advisor to Morgan Stanley\nInternational, Sir David Walker acknowledged that\nthe donors \u201cunderstand the need for sustained\ninvestment\u201d for teaching and research to maintain Cambridge\u2019s excellence.\nIn the year 2010-2011, Imperial College raised\n\u00a39.9 million; 19% more than the previous financial year. Imperial\u2019s alumni have doubled the participation rates and, as a result, more Rector\u2019s\nScholarships have been handed out this year\nthan in 2010-2011. The college aims to award\nRector\u2019s Scholarships to students who meet the\nrequirements to attend the university, but are unable to because of financial reasons. Undergraduate scholarships have increased by three times,\nMasters by five times and PhD scholarships have\ndoubled.\nNiki Kesharaju An annual walkathon to promote healthy\nliving, jointly hosted by the Imperial College London Diabetes Centre (ICLDC) in\nAbu Dhabi and The National Health Insurance Company Daman, took place at the Yas\nMarina Circuit (the venue for the Abu Dhabi\nGrand Prix) on November 25. Walk For Life,\nwhich is now in its fifth year, saw a turnout\nof up to 16,000, with over 45,000 having\ntaken part in it since it began in 2007.\nThe event saw participants immersed in an\nafternoon of family entertainment that included a mix of musical acts as well as fun\nfitness activities, which culminated in a 5km\nwalk undertaken by the participants.\nHosted under the patronage of Her Highness Sheikha Fatima bint Mubarak, Walk\nFor Life is part of ICLDC\u2019s award-winning\npublic health awareness campaign, \u201cDiabetes-Knowledge-Action\u201d, encouraging the\npublic to take charge of their lifestyles. According to Dr Michael Bitzer, Daman\u2019s Chief\nExecutive Officer, Walk For Life \u201cdraws the\nattention of the nation to the importance of\nregular exercise as part of a healthy lifestyle\npractice\u201d, alongside a healthy and balanced\ndiet.\nMeanwhile, ICLDC\u2019s Medical and Research Director and Consultant Endocrinologist, Dr Maha Taysir, Barakat, spoke about\nthe enormous health benefits of exercise. \u201cA\nsedentary lifestyle and a poorly-balanced\ndiet are likely to lead to excess body weight,\nwhich in turn can eventually manifest as\nType 2 Diabetes,\u201d she said.\nThe ICLDC is a state-of-the-art outpatient\nfacility that specializes in diabetes treatment,\nresearch, training and public health aware-ness. Launched in August 2006, the centre\nwas built by Mubadala Healthcare in partnership with Imperial College London. It has\nsince offered diabetes prevention, education\nand treatment to more than 100,000 people.\nCarol Ann Cheah\nAbu Dhabi Diabetes Centre walk on\nPublic sector protests\nWorkers took to the streets on Wednesday over Government pension plans\nThis Wednesday, public sector workers up and\ndown the country went on strike, in what was\ndescribed by some as the \u201cbiggest walkout for a\ngeneration.\u201d The action was directed against the\nGovernment\u2019s planned reforms of public sector pensions, which comprise part of its wide-reaching deficit reduction plan.\nThe most contentious aspects of the changes\nare plans to alter the method of calculating the\npension rate from the current system \u2013 which\nis based on the worker\u2019s final salary \u2013 to one\nwhich is based on his or her career average earn-ings. Accompanying this are plans to raise the\nretirement age to 66 by the year 2020, with the\nintention for it to eventually reach 68.\nThe Government argues that these reforms are\nnecessary, since people are now living longer\nand contributions to pension plans are no longer\nkeeping step with the costs of those pensions.\nThe Unions counter that the proposed changes\nwill unfairly and disproportionately impact\npublic sector workers, with employees having\nto work longer and contribute more towards an\nultimately smaller pension.\nA number of public services have been closed\nor partially closed as a result of the action. Well\nover half of all schools in the country shut their\ndoors, while in hospitals thousands of non-emergency operations and appointments were\ncancelled. Accompanying the strike were large\nmarches in London, as well as other major cities\nsuch as Birmingham, Leeds and Exeter.\nHowever, in spite of the scale of the action,\nproblems at the country\u2019s busy airports were\nkept to a minimum, with very few flight can-cellations. Imperial College was also little af-fected, with very few lectures or tutorials being\ncancelled.\nThe Government has branded the strike \u201cirresponsible\u201d: they claim that it is damaging to the\neconomy and a hindrance to negotiations currently on-going with the Unions. The Unions,\nhowever, say that the Government has not properly engaged in negotiations for some time:\n\u201cthis idea that negotiations are continuing is just\nnot true.\u201d In recent weeks, the Government has\nhinted that its current offer to the Unions could\nbe retracted if an agreement is not reached soon.\nPhotos: Pages 6 and 7\nNavid Nabijou\nAndrew Fok\nImperial College London\nProfessor Lord Ara Darzi is a key figure in the partnership\u2019s development\nCambridge celebrated its 800th year in 2009\n\n"

    "content": "FASHION\nFASHION\nInterview Dressing: Womenswear\nDress code etiquette is key for formal events. Saskia Verhagen shows us how to make the best first impression\nAccesories\nYour shoes and handbag should be good-quality, clean and tasteful, leather (not pat-ent) or suede, in a co-ordinating shade to the rest of your outfit. Shoes and handbag\nneedn\u2019t match; indeed, it can look rather contrived and frumpy if they do. Avoid any\ndesigner-emblazoned anything, and worse than that, any designer knock-offs \u2013 beyond\nterrible.\nShoes should be kept to a modest (less than 3\u201d) height and your handbag should be\nappropriately sized and smart. Jewellery ought to be kept to a bare minimum (sleeper\nearrings, delicate necklace, inconspicuous watch) and colour-appropriate tights or\nstockings are an absolute must: going bare-legged with a skirt on to an interview is a\ntotal faux-pas.\nInformal Interviews\nHere we\u2019re talking about a company dinner\nwith a few executives, or perhaps a casual\ninterview for a cool media post somewhere\nyou\u2019ll find yourself fetching everyone\u2019s tea\norder for your first six months of employ-ment. This type of interview means deciphering the impossible oxymoronic \u2018smart/\ncasual\u2019 dress code \u2013 but fear not: this is\nnot the Everest climbing mission that it\nmight seem.\nAn easy ensemble that never goes out\nof style is the simple pairing of a high-waisted trouser, belted over a silk shirt\n(Equipment is the perennial classic, but\nMiss Selfridge does the job too), keeping\nyour colours muted and neutral: navy, cam-el, taupe, black, white, maybe maroon or\nforest green if you\u2019re feeling adventurous.\nTop this with a tailored brass-buttoned\nblazer which nips in at the waist, a smallish square handbag over the shoulder and\na pair of modest-height heels to complete\nthe look.\nFor these pieces on the high street, Zara\ncuts a wicked jacket and their handbags\nare excellent too. Think Grace Kelly during\nthe day, or classic Katharine Hepburn. The\nlook graces runways season after season\n(see last season\u2019s Paul Smith and Michael\nKors shows for well-styled examples) and\nalways looks elegant and effortless, yet\nfabulously stylish.\nGrooming\nIt is not quite clear why some girls find it so difficult to look properly put-together at\ninterview, the simplest things make the biggest of differences. Make-up should be kept\nas natural as possible: after a proper cleanse, go for a tinted moisturiser and a touch of\nconcealer with the lightest flush of blusher on the cheeks. Take note: no bronzer, no fake\ntan and no full-thickness foundation. Beyond anything else, it looks like you\u2019ve tried too\nhard and with all that effort, all you\u2019ve managed is to look entirely ridiculous. A neutral\neye shadow with a touch of eyeliner and a lick of mascara is all you should need.\nAs for hair, wearing it up or down is a matter of how you feel most confident. It should\nlook neat and you should not feel the need to fiddle with it. Perfume, if you usually wear\nit, should be fresh and never overpowering.\nFormal Interviews\nThere are a few directions a girl can go here:\nfull on skirt suit, coordinating skirt and sepa-rates, or a dress. The choice obviously depends on your personal taste and the company you\u2019re interviewing with, but most often,\ntrousers are not the right choice here.\nIf you are, indeed, a woman entering a\nman\u2019s world, the best thing is to own up to\nit: look feminine and beautifully put-together,\nwith a CV as enviable as your innate sense of\nstyle. The safest and most perennially stylish dress is the wrap dress, made famous by\nDiane von Furstenburg but which you can find\ngood copies up and down the high street. If\nyou\u2019re going for separates, keep the colour\npalette edited down to a maximum of three\nshades, and never monochromatic \u2013 the funeral rule applies to women too. Try white,\ncamel and navy; cream, black and maroon;\npale blue, mustard and navy blue.\nAs mentioned before, fabric choice counts:\nlook for cashmere blends for your sweaters,\nlight wool blends for skirts and jackets and\ncrisp cotton for shirts. Avoid anything too\nstretchy or acrylic like the plague: it feels\ncheap, looks cheap and fits badly.\nSkirts should hit just below the knee and\nsweaters, shirts and jackets should be tailored but not tight. If you\u2019re going to go for\na pattern (a subtle check, houndstooth or\nstripe is acceptable), keep it to one item only,\nincluding accessories.\nG\netting dressed for your interview needn\u2019t be the looming and perilous task that it may seem. As for men, the main principal for a good interview outfit is simple: the keyword is\nsubtlety. Appropriate but not boring, chic but not trendy, classic but not frumpy, feminine but not girly, and most of all, memorable \u2013 but never quirky. This is an exercise in that which\nto women, comes as second nature: subliminal manipulation. We do it all the time, with a turn of phrase, a certain look \u2013 it\u2019s all in the touches which aren\u2019t obvious, but get the\njob done. Each piece, each accessory is clearly well-chosen, sublimely chic and perfectly appropriate. The most crucial thing to remember is to buy the best quality you can afford,\nlook for great cuts and fabrics that fall well on you (Lord knows poly-blend doesn\u2019t fall well on anyone) and quietly sophisticated detailing.\nSo don\u2019t fret; whether you\u2019re gunning up to meet the head honchos at a slick media firm or battening down the hatches in preparation for the endless rounds of interviews at the corporate\nfinance firms, the below guide should sort you out for whatever Careers Services throws your way. And by the way, looking stylish is never about what you wear, but always about how you\nwear it: confidence is key.\n31\nFELIX Friday 02 december 2011\nFashion Editors: Saskia Verhagen\nAlice Yang\nfashion.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n\n"

    "content": "BUSINESS\nFELIX Friday 02 december 2011 13\nin the eurozone, but its public debt is\nstill an 82% GDP; its 10 public banks\nare close to bankruptcy, and many of its\nmunicipalities and lands are broke. A\nlarge proportion (37% and increasing)\nof its energy imports are Russian gas;\nand, most worryingly, its demographics are catastrophic: with an average\nretirement age of 62, in 2060, 44% of\nthe German population will be over 65\nyears old. There is already a huge shortage of qualified labour, and Germany\nhas been forced to attract engineers\nfrom all over Europe to (roughly) sustain its huge industrial sector.\nThe UK is no better: apart from its\nhuge external debt, it heavily relies on\nan oversized financial sector that has already been bailed out by the taxpayers\nand it is not, nonetheless, faring much\nbetter. Its industry having dwarfed in\nthe last 30 years, many of its northern\nregions have been depopulated and un-derdeveloped, as the traditional industries were not replaced. There exists the\nincreasing possibility of secession of\nsome of its regions; and its isolationist tendencies continuously harm its\nnational interests, as it keeps questioning the EU (while at the same time its\neconomy heavily depends on being a\nmember), to the point of being excluded\nfrom many negotiations where financial taxes and other decisions directly\naffecting the City are taken. There are\nno natural resources left, most of them\nbeing imported. By 2050, 25% percent\nof the population will be over 65, and\nalthough the UK is expected to become\nthe most populated country in Western\nEurope, its social inequality, already\namong the highest in the developed\nworld is, too, expected to grow.\nThus, with some countries bailed out,\nsome others at the edge of being so, and\neven the most prosperous nations being\nobjectively in not much better position,\none can conclude that, in general, the\neconomic perspectives of Europe and\nthe Western World do not seem buoy-ant. Recent analyses suggest that by\n2050, Europe (and that includes the\nUK) will have lost 50% of its wealth in\nrelative terms. The USA\u2019s preponderance seems to be waning, its political\nelites having lost their inner consensus\nin a situation that strikingly resembles\nthat of the British Empire during the\nfirst half of the 20th century. The shift\ntowards eastern Asia seems inevitable,\nand the current debt crisis appears to\nbe but signalling that shift. The sad\nthing is that, obnubilated by our neighbour\u2019s problems, no country in the West\nseems to have realised that some long-term thinking beyond the \u201causterity\nmeasures\u201d might be necessary, if only\nso that our future can be tackled with\nsomething other than hopes of bringing\nthe long-absent confidence fairy back.\nO\nn Tuesday, George Osborne, Chancellor of\nthe Exchequer, updated\nParliament on the current economic situation\nof our nation, and what the government\nplans to do about it. The Autumn Statement is seen as an important event in\ngovernment, as it offers an opportunity\nto reflect on pledges made in the main\nbudget, and adjust policy depending on\nrecent events. The Chancellor and his\nteam take the Office of Budget Responsibility\u2019s published report on growth\nand borrowing forecasts and use these\nto adjust the official government position accordingly.\nOne of the pivotal moments of Osborne\u2019s address to Parliament was\nwhen he admitted the Government\u2019s\nfailure to eliminate the budget deficit\nby the end of this Parliament. This was\none of the tories\u2019 main pledges during\nthe election campaign of 2010, and signals a major blow to the Conservatives.\nThe general economic outlook is far\nbleaker now than it was 24 months ago;\nit seems that the austerity measures and\nthe weakness of our public finances,\ncombined with the international economic situations have lead our economy back to recession. Whether or not\nOsborne\u2019s policies are the main responsible is a question of opinion. On\nthe one side, the government is arguing that the stagnation is mainly due\nto external factors such as commodity\nprices and the Eurozone crisis; on the\nother hand, Labour argues that it is the\nway the extensive spending cuts were\nimplemented \u2013 without giving time for\nthe economy to recover, and relying\ntoo much on the private sector \u2013 that is\nthe problem.\nIn any case, the economic situation\nis bleak, and it is going to be so for\nfar longer than expected. This has led\nthe opposition and many international\ncommentators to consider Osborne\u2019s\nplans as doomed. However, the Conservatives do not appear to be ready\nto acknowledge failure. Thus, during\nhis address, the Chancellor pointed out\nthat the cost of our debt had become\nextraordinary low cost. Indeed, this\nweek British bond prices dropped below the price of German debt. That is\nvery significant; German debt is seen\nas extremely safe, and is usually used\nas a benchmark to measure your debt\nagainst. Although Osborne\u2019s failure to\ntackle budget deficit within this Parliament will mean that the UK will have\nto borrow more, this will cost less than\nexpected. Whether or not this is due\nto the austerity measures is not clear;\nanalysts such as David Blanchflower\nbelieve that the only reason for this\nis that, our economic growth being so\nlow, investors think the Bank of England will not dare to increase the interest rates in the next few years. Conservatives claim it is due to the success of\nthe austerity measures.\nTalking about state pensions and\npublic sector pay could lead to novels worth of material, but once again\nOsborne\u2019s message seems to be that\nwe are going to have to start contributing more (especially if you work in\nthe public sector) for our welfare. But\nthe increase in the basic state pension should help alleviate issues such\nas dropping many into poverty at the\nsame time. The fuel duty increase that\nwas planned for January has been postponed till August, but lobbyists would\nprefer it to be scrapped altogether,\nunder the claim that energy and petrol companies will just increase their\nprices and make consumers duty.\nFinally, Osborne made pledges concerning spending on infrastructure,\nbuilding and community projects.\nHowever, he also acknowledged that\nthe extra expenditure in those sectors\nwould be compensated by further cuts\nin other areas, probably firing more\ncivil servants and freezing their pay\nfurther. Credit easing is planned to start\nsoon, helping SMEs borrow at lower\ninterest rates. We will also see a large\ninvestment in infrastructure, with rail\nand motorway upgrades amongst many\nothers and \u00a3400m to be spent on new\nbuilding projects. The 6-month work\nplacement idea looks good on the sur-face, but looks remarkably similar to\nthe Future Jobs Fund that was scrapped\nwhen the coalition came into office.\nBut at the same time, any scheme that\ntries to help youth unemployment cannot be too harshly criticised.\nThe main message from the Autumn\nStatement is that everything is worse\nthan before.

    "content": "COMMENT\nComment Editors: Tim Arbabzadah\nSam Horti\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nA\nfter 12 hours of protest,\nbeginning at 7 in the\nmorning at Liverpool\nStreet, the idea of protesters as lazy hippies\nhas simply dissolved. They believe the\nmantra that the early anarchist gets the\nworm. We saw electricians, librarians,\nteachers, council workers and children\nline the pickets and march in protest\nagainst the changes to public sector\npensions. However, following on from\nthe November 9 student protest where\n4,000 police, 3 helicopters, steel barriers and numerous surveillance techniques were used against 5,000-10,000\nprotestors, the strike day in London was\nmarked by unprovoked heavy handed\npolicing.\nThis has now been termed \u201ctotal policing\u201d and has been created to save\nface for the Government after last year\u2019s\nstudent protests and the summer\u2019s riots.\nAlthough people champion this as what\nthe police should be doing to control vi-olence, the knock on effect is that peaceful protest is being squashed. In the\nmorning, police, with dogs, descended\non 30 picketers in Hackney arresting\nthem for \u201cblocking a road\u201d. Whilst\nthis occurred I took part in the Occupy\nLondon tour of the city raising awareness about the strike during the morning\nrush hour. The police outnumbered us,\ngetting quickly physical, aggressive and\nfrequently kettling us; they obviously\nhad the idea that nothing would happen\ntoday.\nLuke Sheldon\nWe need a new kind of giving\n\u201cTotal policing\u201d not like total football\nBefore heading out on the main London march to Victoria Embankment, I\njoined the public service picket in Brixton. Here people felt angry about bailing out the banks whilst public service\nworkers have greater pressure on their\nalready low pay. They chanted \u201cWhat\ndo we want?\u201d, \u201cA pension\u201d, \u201cWhen do\nwe want it?\u201d, \u201cBefore we die!\u201d This en-ergy, also present on the march, quickly\nfizzled out as people were shepherded\nby lines of police in to almost motionless crowds to allow traffic to continue.\nThe police\u2019s presence flattened nearly\nall emotion.After 3 hours of constrained\nmarching, we arrived at Victoria Embankment exhausted, and like the people around us, feeling like nothing had\nbeen achieved.\nAs the 2 million workers refused to\nwork today, 92% of London schools\nclosed, and thousands flooded the streets\nacross the country. David Cameron remarked in the House of Commons that\nthe day was a \u201cdamp squib\u201d and Boris\nJohnson asserted that it \u201cwon\u2019t make\na bean of difference\u201d. The lack of recognition of the protest, its support, and\nthe nearly successful attempts to quash\nit with the force of police, meant that I\nleft at the end of the march completely\ndisillusioned. Our collective effort has\nachieved nothing due to the arrogance\nof the Government, which believes it\ncan ignore the population and its interests without sparking further riots. As if\nthings could not get worse, we witnessed\nthe baseless arrest of people leaving the\nI\nf you are a science student at Imperial there\u2019s very little you can do to get\ninvolved in international aid. The\nmedics can use their skills to deliver\nlife-saving vaccinations in Mozambique. The engineers can use their skills to\nbuilddrought-fightingdamsinElSalvador.\nAnd us scientists? We get to teach English\nin a random school somewhere.\nOf all the skills I\u2019ve gained from my edu-cation, being able to teach English isn\u2019t one\nthat ever made it to my CV. And yet for so\nmany of us this is the only way to get involved with charities. This feels like a terrible waste of ability. Fortunately it doesn\u2019t\nhave to be this way.\nYou see for all Imperial\u2019s students that\nare involved in charities, there are questions that ought to be answered: just how\ndo we know we\u2019re actually making a dif-ference? How do we measure and improve\noutcomes? This is where the scientists\ncome in.\nI would argue that the state of international development today is much like the\nstate of medicine two hundred years ago.\nThe patient\u2019s problem may be clear but\nshe finds herself surrounded by various\nconflicting quack doctors, each offering\nhis own particular brand of tonic to cure-all-ills. It took the rigour of the scientific\nmethod with its ruthless reliance on ran-domisation and evidence to break through\nthe quackery and create what we now call\nmedicine. To be poor in 2011 is much the\nsame. The problems may be clear but solutions are offered from so many different\ngroups, each peddling their own particular\ncure-all-ills ideology, that any correct answer is likely to be lost among the crowd.\nThe case for a new, rigorous, evidence-based approach to aid couldn\u2019t be clearer.\nAyear ago I had the chance to see how this\ncould work in practice.\nLake Turkana, the largest body of water\nin Kenya, has been the site of so many important archaeological discoveries that it is\ntermed \u201cthe cradle of civilisation\u201d; a title\nthat will strike any foreign visitor as ironic\non seeing an area with miniscule literacy,\nincreasing and devastating drought and a\nHIV prevalence of up to 25%. It was here\nthat a friend and I had the chance to investigate a fishing program, interviewing fishermen who had received subsidies to help\nthem buy boats and nets. After speaking to\naround 200 of these fishermen and going\nfishing ourselves, we took the data back\nhome and ran it through our machines with\na statistician. The results were surprising.\nIt seemed that boats were bad, expensive investments compared to nets. Boats\nserved more as a status symbol than an\neconomic investment. But this was good\nnews. It meant that the charity funding the\nsubsidies could shift their focus onto nets,\nsaving them money while increasing the\nnumber of fish caught. They are currently\nworking on how best to implement this\nstrategy.\nThe power of what was essentially a lab\nreport level analysis was surprising and\nexciting. But the role that the scientific\nmethod can play gets so much more sexy\nwith Randomised Control Trials, or RCTs.\nprotests in Trafalgar Square; and when\nwe gave them legal advice, as the police were ignoring the legal process, we\nwere threatened with arrest ourselves.\nDemocracy is being burned to ashes.\nHowever, a surprise Phoenix of civil\ndisobedience managed to escape from\nthe heavily policed flames. On the authority of Occupy London we gathered\nin Piccadilly Circus along with considerable riot police, though, as if by magic,\nhundreds of Greek football fans entered\nthe square celebrating a victory. The\npolice got distracted, the samba band\nkicked into action and a flare led crowd\ncharged around the corner into Xtrata,\nthe company with the highest paid CEO\nin the FTSE100. Noam Chomsky criticises football for distracting the masses\nfrom political action, though here the\ndistraction served a much-needed pur-pose.\nToday would have passed with no\nmention of the bankers that have caused\nthis crisis, as the city was heavily\nblocked. The politicians safely lay behind 12 foot steel fences and the Tory\nheadquarters, ransacked in last year\u2019s\nstudent protests, were guarded, even\nthough they lay miles from the crowds.\nHowever, by shear chance, the startling\ninequality of this country \u2013 where the\nCEO of Xtrata is paid \u00a318million a year\nas 60% of children in the nearby Tower\nHamlets lie in poverty \u2013 could be shone\nin all its disgusting glory. The protesters who peacefully entered the building\nwill now expect up to a year of legal\nproceedings to be prosecuted with aggravated trespass \u2013 a charge purely created for policing peaceful protest. The\nnight of arrest was also be filled with\npolice harassment; the people caught in\nthe vicinity are being placed on police\nrecords (hopefully including the suit-wearing man who kicked me), police\ndogs were brought in to an already contained crowd and I have heard reports of\npolice violence in isolated pens.\nEven with the disproportionate scale\nof police reactions, people still felt it\nnecessary to highlight the issues with\nthe Government\u2019s austerity measures,\nwhere the poor are punished as CEOs\nsee their pay constantly rising. And for\nthe moments where the orange glare of\nthe flare guided people into the bastion\nof inequality that is Deloitte, it was truly\nbeautiful.\nTo overuse a metaphor, they work just like\nmedical trials \u2013 properly randomised with\ncontrol groups receiving no aid and a test\ngroup receiving \u2018treatment\u2019 such as a particular microfinance program or school\nsystem. Carrying out this kind of trial takes\nexactly the skills required in a science de-gree.\nThe ability of the scientific method to\nshine a light on a hitherto murky world of\nguesswork and quackery has been proved\nover the centuries, but its role in aid is just\nstarting to be recognised. Some at Imperial\nhave taken a lead in this \u2013 Sir Alan Fenwick will be talking about his experience\nin just this work today at 6 in SAF. It will\nlikely be today\u2019s graduates who will help\nshape an aid debate in which evidence truly\ntriumphs over ideology. For this to happen\nthe aid world needs more scientists getting\ninvolved. Looking to make a difference?\nA career in development may be an unexpected use for your degree, but it\u2019s much\nmore effective than teaching damned English. Who\u2019s with me?\nSome people just can\u2019t do anything\nright...\nRory Fenton\nEven with the\ndisproportionate\nscale of police\nreactions, people\nstill felt it necessary\nto highlight the\nissues with the\nGovernment\u2019s\nausterity measures\n\u201d\n...the aid world\nneeds more\nscientists getting\ninvolved\n\u201c\n...the a\n...the a\nneeds\nneeds\nFELIX\n16 Friday 02 december 2011\n\u201d\ns\ns\nasures\nasures\n\u201c\nEven w\nEven w\ndisprop\ndisprop\nAndrew Fok\n\n"

    "content": "ARTS\nArts Editor: Eva Rosenthal\nWill Prince\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nThe first poetry evening I attended left me with\nthe somewhat sour taste of disappointment, en-hanced, no doubt, by the dashed hopes I\u2019d been\nharbouring all week. Instead of great poetry, I\nwas faced by something resembling slapstick\nstand-up comedy.\nFor that reason, I turned up to Fluent on Paper with no hopes at all \u2013 and was very pleasantly surprised. Hosted in one of South Kensington\u2019s nicest pubs, The Builders Arms, the\natmosphere was warming, perfect for a freezing November night. In front of a dark banner,\naspiring poets read their work to an audience of\nfriendly faces; no doubt welcoming in the face\nof spilling your emotions to complete strang-ers.\nMost of those reading their poetry had never\ndone so in public before. They managed in spite\nof shaking hands and voices; their courage was\ninspiring. Ed Spencer in particular, who was\nthe last of the invited poets, established the necessity of \u2018acting\u2019 one\u2019s readings. Perhaps his\npoetry was not what one would call \u2018first-rate\u2019,\nbut no-one noticed or even cared because he\nproved to be such a fantastic actor; his poems\nlived and breathed in his interpretation of them.\nThere were even several poems written on\nthe spot, as people found themselves inspired\nby the creativity of the evening. MattAllinson\u2019s\nhilarious poem on the organiser of the event,\nKadhim Shubber, certainly had the laughter\nflowing. Dylan Lowe ended the night with a\npoem written in ten minutes on the beauty of\nBulgaria.\nOne was never meant to enjoy poetry alone\nand in silence. Instead, poetry readings were\ncommonplace in homes, public spaces and at\nthe glittering literary salons of the past. It is impossible to translate the nature of these events\nto our hurried times, but Fluent on Paper certainly tries. From January onwards, it will be a\nmonthly event and I encourage both poets and\nlovers of poetry to attend.

They were botoxed and dyed blonde\nand high-heeled. It was then that I became\nengulfed in a peculiar Hemingwayesque\nmalaise. It was then that I realised just how\ndepressing desperate housewives are. It was\nthen that I noticed there are too many cheerless people busy gold digging and lust searching at the same time when the two appear to\nbe incompatible. They demonstrate that romance is dead in all too many marriages.\nIt was therefore appropriate that I stumbled\nupon Woody Allen\u2019s latest cinematic oeuvre\nMidnight in Paris on Wednesday. In what has\nbeen rightfully hailed as a cinematic tour of\na golden age of art and literature, the film\nprominently features Ernest Hemingway\nthroughout. His bold, poignant sentences in\nstark contrast to Owen Wilson\u2019s lead character\u2019s somewhat clumsy Californian chat.\nThe film explores, by means of sharp wit\nand a stunning Parisian back-drop, that a\nlife without art is a life not worth living. As\nGertrude Stein (yes, she\u2019s in the film too) ob-serves: \u201cThe artist\u2019s job is not to succumb to\ndespair but to find an antidote for the emptiness of existence.\u201d It is around this theme that\nwe meet Picasso, Matisse, Dal\u00ed, Man Ray,\nScott Fitzgerald, and many more; each with\ntheir own delightfully attributed clich\u00e9s. Not\nleast Hemingway, parodied with such gems as\n\u201cno subject is terrible if the story is true and if\nthe prose is clean and honest.\u201d\nA couple of years ago I saw Woody Allen\nplay the clarinet with his New Orleans Jazz\nBand in Paris. While his rendition of \u2018If I Had\nYou\u2019 sounded more asthmatic wheezing fox\nthan Benny Goodman, his passion for jazz\nshone through. His films have consistently\nplayed themselves out to the tune of jazz\nstandards and provided the uninitiated with a\nglut of great melodies. Midnight in Paris is no\ndifferent, with Cole Porter making an appearance as he strokes the ivories to the sound of\n\u2018Let\u2019s Do\u2019 It at a characteristic 1920\u2019s hedonistic party.\nThe movie also argues that lasting relationships are built neither on lust nor love at first\nsight. Unlike the pseudo-romantic marriages\nof the aforementioned desperate housewives,\nthey are built on understanding founded on\nshared tastes. Woody Allen has his critics.\nThey proclaim that the gags are cheap and\nthat the sets are clich\u00e9d and that the plots\nare thin. But I have always loved his films\n(although best to avoid Scoop). Perhaps this\nlove too stems from shared tastes. Affection\nfor jazz, hearty quips, and a belief that life\nshouldn\u2019t be taken too seriously.\nCharles Betts\nTo those who read Felix for the witty picture captions, I\u2019m sorry\n\u201cThe artist\u2019s job is not to\nsuccumb to despair but\nto find an antidote for\nthe emptiness of existence\u201d\nI see why Hugh Grant likes Brinkley\u2019s\n\n"

With relegation a shocking possibility, the team\nknew that they needed to register a win\nsoon, which is exactly what they did\nagainst a shell-shocked Sussex 2nd XI.\nPlaying 4-4-2 with a diamond had\nnot been working for IC who have been\nlacking an attacking edge all season.\nSo with drastic times calling for drastic\nmeasures, the team changed to a 4-3-3 and within minutes of the push back\nthis change almost reaped immediate\nrewards with SCID almost knocking in\na loose ball but for good work by the\nSussex keeper.\nIC kept up this pressure throughout\nthe first 10 minutes of the half, but after\nthis period, the game started to turn. A\nbreak by Sussex into our D saw goalkeeper Sifter run out to make a fine\ngoal-saving tackle, but severely injure\nhis neck in the process.\nAfter a lengthy injury time out, IC\ntook too long to get back into the game\nand found themselves a goal down\nwhen the Sussex forward snuck in behind the otherwise excellent Eager Beaver and Fritzl to slot coolly past a helpless Sifter. Some more poor play from\nIC offered Sussex plenty of opportuni-ties, but thankfully poor finishing kept\nthe score at just 1-0 when going into\nhalf time.\nAn inspiring half-time team talk from\nSifter rallied the troops, reminding the\nteam to play simple hockey and show\nthat they were better than their Sussex\nopposition. This, combined with the\nthought of losing all of the first five\ngames of the season and the exuberant\nsupport of the Ladies 2s, saw IC push\nhard from the off in the second half.\nEverything just seemed the click after half time. The midfield dynamo of\nFresher Hemal, Designer V, and Aquaman dominated the opposition, leaving\nCockerel, Fresher Ed, Pappity-BoopityPopitty and Munter Gatherer to exploit\nthe spaces behind the defence and provide golden opportunities for SCID.\nIt didn\u2019t take IC long to draw level,\nwhen a surging run down the right by\nCockerel found the stick of Designer V\nwho laid the ball on a plate for SCID to\nfinish off. With that equaliser going in,\nIC were very much on top, and had Sussex reeling. Wave after wave of IC attack failed to produce a goal until Bum\nTablet caught one of Sussex forwards\nnapping while on the ball, and produced\na scintillating run, fluking his way past\ntwo defenders before getting barged\noff the ball and winning a short corner.\nFrom the resulting short, Fresher Hemal\nsmashed the ball into the goal putting IC\nahead.\nSussex were stunned and try as they\ncould, they failed to muster much of a\nresponse with the IC defence pushing\nup high and snuffing out attacks before\nthey could develop. It was a nervy end\nto the match though, as Sussex were\nawarded a short at the death but Gingypops stood up to the test and pressured\nthe Sussex forward into a mistake.\n2-1 the final score and a thoroughly\ndeserved win for the Men\u2019s 3s who hope\nto extend this one match winning streak\nagainst the RSM next week.\nThe medal-winning Imperial judokas pose for the camera, with smiles all around. Of course, they could kill you\nin the blink of an eye\nSport Editors: Indy Leclercq\nDavid Wilson\nsport.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n\n"

    "content": "An online petition calling for ex-Imperial\nCollege staff member Babar Ahmad to\nbe put on trial in the United Kingdom\nreached 141,000 signatures by its closing date of November 11, passing the requirement of 100,000 for a discussion in\nParliament. This has led to a parliamentary debate being held next week on the\nissue of extradition.\nBabar Ahmad is the longest impris-oned-without-charge UK citizen, having\nbeen imprisoned for over 7 years. He is\nfighting extradition to the US and the\nonline petition was set up by his family\nto grant him a UK trial before he is ex-tradited.\nInstead of the case being raised in\nWestminster Hall as an individual dis-cussion, Babar Ahmad\u2019s case was included as a part of a bigger debate on\nextradition on November 24. The debate\nwas only attended by 35 MPs but the\nconclusion was that the Babar Ahmad\nonline petition should be discussed in the\nmain chamber of the Commons.\nGreen Party MP Caroline Lucas specifically mentioned the case during the\ndebate. She acknowledged that the case\nwas unique and the amount of support\nbehind it was substantial enough for its\nown discussion. She said: \u201cthe family\nand the 140,000 plus people who signed\n3\nFELIX Friday 02 december 2011\nNEWS\nMore student cuts\nMore student cuts for Imperial\nstudents at South Kensington\u2019s\nFRESH Hairdressers.\nMen\u2019s cuts \u00a322\nWomen\u2019s shampoo and cut and\nshake dry \u00a328\nWomen\u2019s shampoo, cut and\nblow-dry \u00a338\nAll of our cuts are done by highly\nexperienced stylists.\nTuesday to Fridays 9.30 to\n4.30 (sorry no discounts on\nSaturdays).\nWe are only 70 metres from\nSouth Kensington tube station\nTo book an appointment, call\nSponsored Editorial\nDiscount haircuts for Imperial\nstudents at Fresh Hairdressers\n0207 823 8968.

This\ncomes as news, as they had previously\nstated that there was insufficient evidence to prosecute him in the UK, hence\nhis extradition to the US.\nBabar Ahmad\u2019s father, Ashfaq Ahmad\ncommented on this revelation saying that\n\u201cIt is quite shocking to learn that the CPS\nmade no effort to examine the evidence\nseized from Babar\u2019s home but instead\nsimply outsourced our criminal justice\nVotable parliamentary discussion on extradition to take place on Monday\nNews Editors: Sophia David\nAlex Nowbar\nnews.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nAemun Reza\nsystem to the US.

They are\nconfident that, even though the case is\nnot mentioned in the final text of the mo-tion, it will be the milestone they need.\nAshfaq Ahmad said: \u201cIt is essential\nthat any reforms to the extradition laws\nthat are voted for apply to pending cases\nsuch as Babar\u2019s as it would be absolutely\nimmoral to extradite British citizens under a Treaty that has been found by Parliament to be unfair.\u201d\nThe full text of the motion calls upon\nthe House of Commons to \u201creform the\nUK\u2019s extradition arrangements as a matter of urgency to strengthen the protection of British citizens\u201d through the\nintroduction of a Bill in Parliament to\n\u201cenact the safeguards recommended by\nthe Joint Committee on Human Rights in\nits Fifteenth Report of 2010-12, and by\npursuing such amendments to the UKUS Extradition Treaty 2003 and the EU\nCouncil Framework Decision 2002 on\nthe European Arrest Warrant\u201d.\nThis is a significant step for the Free\nBabar Ahmad campaign. The organisers have expressed their gratitude for the\noverwhelming public support of 141,000\nsignatures that brought Babar Ahmad\u2019s\ncase to the government\u2019s attention. They\nare now awaiting the outcome of the debate on December 5 and how it will affect Babar Ahmad\u2019s case.\ne-petitions\nAny British citizen or UK resident can create an e-petition,\nwith the aim of the service\nas an \u201ceasy way for the public to engage with politics\u201d.\nEven if an e-petition reaches\n100,000 signatures, it does\nnot guarantee a debate in the\nHouse of Commons.

    "content": "Tim Arbabzadah tries to not look like a hipster as he reviews a slightly obscure show\nTELEVISION\nFELIX Friday 02 December 2011 27\nLouie: like Seinfeld, but with swearing\nL\nouie is directed, written, edited by, and\nstarring Louis C.K. The show is basically him; in fact, I\u2019ve heard an interview that says he helps with the cinematography as well. I\u2019m not exactly\nsure how to describe the look of the show, but I\u2019ll\ngive it a go. It\u2019s shot as a single camera show in the\nsame way as The Thick of It is. That should give\nyou an idea of the sort of visual style to expect,\nhopefully.\nLouie centres around a fictionalised version of\nLouis C.K (don\u2019t ask about the discrepancy in\nname spelling, as I have no idea either). Louis C.K\nis, in real life, a comedian\u2019s comedian, who is very\nwell respected in the comedy world. He\u2019s also got\na style that is very funny and accessible. It\u2019s not\nall pretentious \u2018clever\u2019 humour of deconstructing\nthe joke style comedy. I say that because I fear the\nother sentence made it sound like he was, like, so\nunderground and non-mainstream, man. He really\ndoes have jokes that many people will appreciate.\nIn case you haven\u2019t noticed, I\u2019m trying hard to not\nsound a bit douchey. I\u2019m probably failing. Anyway, in the show, Louie is a comedian who is well\nrespected and doing okay, but not exactly thriving.\nHe has two daughters and is divorced. It\u2019s difficult\nto say what the overall plot of the show is, as there\nisn\u2019t one in the traditional sense. One of the reasons for this lack of a central theme is that Louie\nis basically the only main character.All other characters make appearances every now and then, but\ncouldn\u2019t really be described as main characters.\nThere is a woman that he likes that doesn\u2019t like him\nback, but it\u2019s not your traditional sitcom will-they\nwon\u2019t-they although they-obviously-will-eventu-ally vibe. It\u2019s a bit more tragic as he tries a couple\nof times to go for it and gets batted away each time.\nIf you can pretend that this is a seamless segue;\nI want to point out that way too many shows have\na fairly predictable basic premise and central plot\nline: the main character has feelings that are not\nreciprocated. That\u2019s fine, it\u2019s a common life occurrence that is relatable and can be used to derive\nhumour or drama from. My problem is that most\nshows play that ultimate they-get-together card too\nearly. The guy gets the girl, then, the show thinks\n\u201coh, fuck, hang on, that was our main plot and\nwe\u2019ve been renewed and need to stretch this out\ninto another season. Right, let\u2019s now have something happen and it goes badly, then we can get\nthem back together later on. Oh, here\u2019s a good\nidea, she gets back together with her jerk, jock\nboyfriend\u201d. If the guy has got the girl once, the\nwhole \u2018she\u2019s so out of his league and is his dream\ngirl\u2019 aspect is like David Cameron\u2019s social con-science: lost.\nEvery episode of Louie is split into two parts,\neach being fairly self-contained (absolutely seamless segue back into review mode, right? No, yeah,\nfair point). This is interspersed with scenes of him\ndoing stand-up in a comedy club (think Seinfeld,\nbut with swearing). Actually, Seinfeld isn\u2019t too\nbad a comparison, it\u2019s \u2018mundane\u2019 in the fact that\nit\u2019s just about a guy\u2019s life and \u2018stuff\u2019 happening. It\ndiffers in that it\u2019s occasionally a bit odd. At times\nit can be bleak, but sometimes the show is, surpris-ingly, heart-warming. There was an episode where\nhe goes to perform to troops and that has a very\nuplifting ending. I don\u2019t want to give it away, but it\nreally did make you feel good afterwards.\nLouie is also littered with guest stars. Considering the low budget, the quality of guest stars is\namazing. I think this shows just how popular Louis\nC.K is with comedians. Everyone from Amir of\nJake and Amir fame to Chris Rock, Dane Cook\nand Joan Rivers has made an appearance. These\nguests are always used well, and aren\u2019t just there to\nshow off that he knows famous people.\nBasically, Louie is funny, well written, and worth\na watch. It may not be everyone\u2019s cup of tea, but I\nthink the stand-up routines are something that we\ncan all enjoy, even if you don\u2019t like the rest of the\nshow.\ntv.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nPick of the week\nWell, he\u2019s only human\nTelevision Editors: George Barnett\nJames Simpson\nSaturday | 1700 - 1800 | Quest\nHitler\u2019s Henchmen\nThe life of Hermann Goering \u2013 founder of the\nGestapo and a man of extravagant tastes \u2013 is\nexamined in this documentary.\nMonday | 2030 - 2100 | BBC1\nPanorama\nSophie Raworth explores whether or not supermarket money-saving offers actually save\nyou money.\nMonday | 2200 - 2300 | E4\nDesperate Scousewives\nScouse based semi-reality show.

So when I\nheard about Modern Family, I didn\u2019t think much\nof it. The advert on TV just made me cringe. That\nwas until I watched an episode.

Right from\nthe start, the stereotypes come rolling out: old\nguy with a younger wife who says \u201cdjes\u201d (\u201cyes\u201d\nwith the cutest Colombian accent) and it keeps on\ngoing. Manny is a grand romantic, writes songs\nand poetry, wears silk shirts and cologne. He\u2019s an\n(and performing them in front of his girlfriend\u2019s\nparents).\nThroughout the series two characters gain in\nimportance and screen time.

Well, researchers at the\nUniversity of California, Berkeley, have discovered a way to take the edge off those painful memories \u2014 all you have to do is nod off\nlong enough to dream.\nMatthew Walker, lead author on the study\npublished last week in the journal Current\nBiology, and his colleagues showed that rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, the phase of\nsleep in which we dream, is associated with a\ndecrease in activity in a part of the brain that\nprocesses emotions. This decrease in activity\nallows a more \u2018rational\u2019 part of the brain to\ntake over the processing of memories, decreasing their \u201cemotional intensity\u201d.\nThirty-five people, split into two groups,\nparticipated in the study. Both groups viewed\n150 images, chosen to elicit certain emotions,\ntwice, with 12 hours between the two view-ings. The only difference was that one group\nsaw the images in the morning and then again\nin the evening in the same day, having remained awake in between, whereas the other\ngroup saw the images in the evening and then\nagain the next morning, after a night\u2019s sleep.\nThose that slept in between the two viewings\nreported a significant decrease in their emotional\nreaction to the images. MRI scans also showed a\nsignificant reduction in activity in the amygdala,\na part of the brain that processes emotions. Walker and his colleagues noticed that when activity\nin the amygdala decreased, the more \u2018rational\u2019\nprefrontal cortex became more active.\nREM sleep is also associated with changes\nin neurotransmitters. Walker and colleagues\nmeasured electrical brain activity and used this\nto show that levels of neurotransmitters associated with stress decreased during REM sleep.\nWalker thinks that reprocessing emotional experiences during this period will soften those\nmemories and allow us to wake up feeling better than when we went to sleep.\nUnfortunately, dreaming won\u2019t stop other\npeople remembering your drunken escapades,\nbut at least your own memories of the event\nwill be a bit blurry around the edges.\nMore seriously, the findings point to an explanation of why people with post-traumatic\nstress disorder find it difficult to recover from\ntheir experiences. Walker thinks that perhaps\nthis dreaming therapy does not work the way it\nshould in people with post-traumatic stress dis-order, so they relive the full painful experience\nDreaming of another world\nScience Editors: Kelly Oakes\nAlexander Karapetian\nYou should have seen this guy last night... he\u2019s going to have to nap for a very long time\nScientists discover hidden channels under nanofolds and wrinkles\nWrinkles and folds are important in nature as they\nallow a large surface area to be fitted into a small\nvolume. Studying these features could lead to the\ndevelopment of smaller electronic devices or even\nflexible computer tablets. Recent research from a\ngroup of scientists from the USA and South Korea\nhas bought these technologies a step closer to re-ality.\nKyung-Suk Kim, professor of engineering at Brown\nUniversity, says that \u201cwrinkles are everywhere in\nscience but they hold certain secrets.\u201d Writing last\nweek in the Proceedings of the Royal Society A, Kim\nand his team describe how they created wrinkles in\n20 to 80 nanometre thick gold films by depositing\nthem on a stretched layer of polydimethylsiloxane\n(PDMS), a rubber-like substrate commonly used in\nthe electronics industry. When the tension on the\nPDMS was released the gold sheet buckled to form\nwrinkles. The surface of these wrinkles was then\nexamined using atomic force microscopy while cut\nsections of the film were studied by a scanning electron microscope.\nThe team discovered that when the gold film buck-les, difficult-to-see secondary wrinkles are formed\nat large separations from each other in addition to\nthe far more closely spaced primary wrinkles. When\nthe gold film is compressed to a greater degree the\nspacing between these secondary wrinkles was unexpectedly found to increase, rather than decrease,\nas is the case for the main primary wrinkles.\nThe team also found that if the gold was compressed asymmetrically it followed the so-called\nOgden model and the wrinkles began to touch, forming fully-fledged folds. Upon closer examination, the\nteam found that previously undiscovered nanochan-nels were buried below the films. Professor Kim\nsaid, \u201cThey were hidden \u2013 we were the first ones\nto cut [the film] and see that there are channels\nunderneath.\u201d\nThe discoveries improve our theoretical understanding of folds and wrinkles, but could also have\nsignificant implications for fluid transport and be\nused in anything from microscopic pumps to water\npurification systems.\nDOI: 10.1098/rspa.2011.0567\nMaciej Matuszewski\nevery time the memory is triggered.\nBut hope is not lost for patients with posttraumatic stress disorder. A physician at a US\nDepartment of Veteran Affairs hospital noticed\nthat post-traumatic stress disorder patients who\nwere taking a generic blood pressure drug had\nfewer reoccurring nightmares. It turned out\nthat the drug has the side effect of suppressing the stress neurotransmitters that are usually\nreduced during REM sleep.\nThis observation was what prompted Walker\nto investigate the link between REM sleep and\npost-traumatic stress disorder in the first place.\nThis study helps to explain how the drug helps\nthose with post-traumatic stress disorder and\nmay even open doors to new treatments that\nrelate sleep and mental illness.\nDOI: 10.1016/j.cub.2011.10.052\nFELIX\n8 Friday 02 December 2011\nKelly Oakes on what to do if you need to take the edge off painful memories\nMoulds are perhaps the least celebrated of or-ganisms, with the notable exception of the one\nthat led to Alexander Fleming\u2019s discovery of\npenicillin in 1928. The story is well-known:\nthe fungal spores were accidentally allowed\nto contaminate a petri dish, Fleming observed\nthat the mould was killing the culture of bacteria on the plate, and on further investigation it\nwas found to be secreting an anti-bacterial substance which we now know as the first antibi-otic: penicillin. It\u2019s surprising, then, that we\u2019ve\nnever known exactly what it was.\nAt least, that was the conclusion of recent\nresearch from Imperial\u2019s School of Public\nHealth, published in Molecular Ecology. The\nspecies has usually been identified as Penicillium chrysogenum, a commonly occurring\nmicroscopic fungus found in air and household dust and on some foods. And indeed P.\nchrysogenum, originally derived from mould\non a cantaloupe melon, has been the culture of\nchoice for industrial penicillin production over\nthe years. However when preserved samples\nof Fleming\u2019s culture were subjected to modern\ngenetic analysis techniques, they turned out\nto contain a separate species, as yet unnamed.\nIn fact, what we\u2019ve previously considered to\nbe simply P. chrysogenum actually appears to\ncover four distinct species.\nThis finding is of more than historical in-terest, however. Subtle differences between\nspecies of fungus mean they secrete slightly\ndifferent versions of the antibiotic, or yield\ngreater or lesser amounts. Understanding the\ndifferences and accurately identifying distinct\nstrains gives us the ability to select for particular pharmaceutical properties, and discover\nentirely new compounds. As antibiotic resistance becomes an increasingly serious prob-lem, innovation and clearer understanding in\nthis field are essential.\nAlso this work offers a fascinating insight\ninto the complex and debate-filled world of\nfungal species identification. Distinguishing\nbetween species is not always straightforward,\nleast of all when dealing with microscopic\nasexual organisms where it is difficult to even\ndefine exactly what \u2018species\u2019 means. Indeed\nFleming himself originally identified his fungus as P. rubrum, before P. chrysogenum was\naccepted as the correct diagnosis.\nEarlier this year, other prominent researchers in the field published their claim that Fleming\u2019s species is in fact P. rubens. We may well\nexpect a response from them soon, and the outcome is by no means certain. It would seem a\nfitting tribute, however, if Imperial scientists\ncould honour their famous predecessor by giving his species their proposed name of Penicillium flemingii.\nDOI: 10.1111/j.1365-294X.2011.05244.x\nFleming\u2019s fungus finally identified\nSarah Byrne\nLike us on Facebook\nFollow the latest science\nnews from Imperial and\naround the world on our\nFacebook Page:\nfacebook.com/FelixScience\n\n"

    "content": "MUSIC\nThe best of Heaven\nArgentine punk had a troubled upbringing.\nThough inspired by the notoriety of the Sex Pistols, Argentina\u2019s pioneers couldn\u2019t afford to play\nthe same kind of media-baiting games. The year\nthat brought us punk rock brought Argentina a vicious military dictatorship, and all evidence suggests dictators don\u2019t like punk.\nOne of the most important scene-setting bands\nwas Los Violadores (1981-) \u2013 the violators, or lawbreakers \u2013 who despite the heavy-handed censorship established an underground movement of\ndissent and released an album a year. One way\nthey survived their dangerous early period was by\nadopting the name Los Voladores \u2013 the flying ones\n\u2013 whenever things looked especially dicey. They\u2019re\nstill going strong, chastising slightly younger upstarts 2 Minutos (1987-) for writing unpunk songs\nabout beer and football.\nJust as Argentine punk was escaping its oppressed childhood and coming of age, the Falklands War made eveything associated with the\nUK, well, let\u2019s just say uncool. Sumo (1981-1987),\none of the most influential scene-setters, never\nwanted to be a punk band in the first place, and\npeppered its sound with everything from reggae\nto tango. Luca Prodan, Sumo\u2019s frontman, was\nborn in Rome but grew up in Scotland, where he\nwent to Gordonstoun \u2013 the famously cold and\ncharacter-building boarding school that counts\nboth the Queen\u2019s husband and eldest son among\nits alumni. But unlike our heir to the throne, Prodan then befriended Joy Division\u2019s Ian Curtis in\nManchester, suffered from heroin addiction, and\nmoved to a friend\u2019s farm in Argentina\u2019s backwoods\nto kick the habit. There he recorded a few songs\nin a small studio, eventually moved to the big city,\nand ended up fronting one of the biggest bands in\nArgentina. As heritage stories go, Sumo\u2019s beats\nthe usual Peter-meets-Jane-at-art-school.\nBut let\u2019s end with the fine example of Fun\nPeople (1989-2000), a converse-wearing, pogo-jumping punk band in the same bouncy vein as\nBad Brains. Originally called Anesthesia after a\nfamous Metallica song, they eventually wisely\npromoted their music as antifascist gay hardcore\nto distance themselves from the moshing boneheads they were attracting.\nAll these bands want you to visit their websites,\nexcept Sumo who might not have one. Los Violadores: www.violadores.com, 2 Minutos:\nwww.2minutosweb.com.ar, Fun People: www.\nfunpeople.com.ar.\nE\nMA stands for Erika M. Anderson, but she performs with a full\nband. Her debut album Past Life\nMartyred Saints has been gathering positive reviews from across\nthe music press spectrum, and for good rea-son. The live performance is something else,\nthough. The whole gig switches between\nhaunting vulnerability and rip-your-face-off\nintensity. Her lyrics are rarely positive and she\ndoesn\u2019t betray that with her stage demeanour.\nThe main highlight is \u2018Butterfly Knife\u2019,\nwhich climaxes in heavy strobing, a monstrous\nwall of sound, a guitar being smashed apart\nand its neck being launched into the crowd at\nconcerning velocity. This is followed by the\nmost beautiful section of the set, as she quietly\nstrums through \u2018Marked\u2019, with its slightly disarming refrain of \u201cI wish that every time you\ntouched me left a mark\u201d. \u2018Closer California\u2019\nis sublimely apathetic and ends with another\nguitar being thrown to the ground.\nShe\u2019s certainly somebody I\u2019d recommend\neverybody to go and see, although I\u2019d also\nrecommend taking a hard hat.\nZola Jesus is another female \u2018solo artist\u2019,\nalthough she at least has the decency to keep\nthe rest of her band shrouded in darkness and\nsmoke for the majority of the set. Her influences range from industrial bands Throbbing\nGristle and Swans to avant-garde composer\nStockhausen all the way through to Tina\nTurner. The result is a unique blend of grimy\nlo-fi noise, ethereal dream pop and a big voice.\nThere are relatively few older tracks but those\nrelatively few are great. The swelling build-up\nof \u2018Run Me Out\u2019 is particularly pleasing.\nThe new album tracks also deliver. \u2018Hikikomori\u2019 is a beautiful swirl of synths and wailing vocals and on \u2018In Your Nature\u2019 she gives\na performance to match anything I\u2019ve heard.\nIt\u2019s a fantastic show and not one you\u2019re likely\nto get elsewhere. One of the best gigs of my\nyear.\nDespite the insistence of a delightful lady\nbehind me, there is nobody that can match her\nvoice. It is massive. She forced her parents\ninto giving her opera lessons as a child, and\nI\u2019m glad they relented. As a frontwoman, she\nexceeds all expectations as well, switching\nbetween statuesque-princess mode and bent-double-over-her-microphone-flailing-limbs\nmode. There were even two forays into the\ncrowd and a strobe-lit headbanging sequence.\nFELIX Friday 02 December 2011 25\nPunk Planet by\nDouglas Heaven\nThis week: Argentinian punk\nCMYK Vibrations\nStuart Masson is impressed by EMA and Zola Jesus\nIf you squint, the bricks behind Zola Jesus almost look like forks\nJames Blake. The face of a dazed little boy,\npresumably innocent and so melancholic at the\nsame time, with a voice, or should I say voices\n(oh the beauty of transpositions) so poignant it\nmakes you want to bury your face in your hands\nand cry \u2013 it\u2019s OK, don\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t tell any-one. So finally, I managed to witness the contained and cleanly crafted songs come to life at\nthe HMV Forum for the last show of his tour,\nand here\u2019s the impression I got to carry around\nsince then.\nThe young prodigies Vondelpark opened\nthe show, a one-man act who lately adopted a\nfew other kids. With the looks of one of those\nscruffy-haired rock bands followed constantly\nby their horde of screeching groupies, their\nsound was unexpected in the best possible way,\nsounding much more electronic and bearing\nproof of their musical maturity. Coherent with\nthe main act, they were a very pleasant discov-ery, and less pretentious and \u2018widespread\u2019 (to\navoid using that other ugly m-word\u2026) in several\nways for the harsher critics out there.\nThen James Blake came on, alone, with his\ntraditional highly buttoned-up collared shirt and\nimmaculate hair. A peaceful look on his face,\ncollected and confident, he managed nevertheless to bring an imposing and nearly intimidating charisma on stage with him. The lighting\nwas clearly studied, the stage setting was mini-mal, and the sound system tremendous. The\nmagnificence of seeing James Blake live in such\na context lied in how the music which usually\nseems to appear so contained manages to gain\nso much intensity and power, offering a perspective on his music I could have never imagined.\nThe way objects and liquids vibrate in the\nvideo of \u2018Limit to Your Love\u2019 seemed to gain a\nwhole new meaning when, this time, it was my\nentire body experiencing it. I gave up on keeping my gaze on James Blake. I just let it all carry\nme away. Eyes closed, every single organ in my\nbody felt the music. The show wasn\u2019t meant to\nappeal exclusively to hearing or sight anymore.\nIt was something transcending what was expected from a gig. A journey through some emotionally charged music, like some of Antony and\nthe Johnsons\u2019 concentrate of musicality and\nclassical immoderation blended with the bluntness of post-dubstep beats.\nFrom a faithful take on \u2018I Never Learnt to\nShare\u2019 to an incredible improvisational dub of\n\u2018CMYK\u2019 or other sparkling renditions of some\nmore recent songs like \u2018A Case of You,\u2019he managed to take the last breath away from every one\nof us standing in that fully packed venue, making us only scream for more.\nUnder the sea, where the octopuses live\nKatherine Chimenes\n\n"
