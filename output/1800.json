Did you even know that\nSocial Care visas were introduced in\nAugust 2020 to address this problem?\nI didn\u2019t know either, and it\u2019s part of\nmy job to read the news. Such progress\ncan be described as \u2018moderately good\u2019;\nthere\u2019s no attention-grabbing\nheadline that can be written\nabout a slightly different\ntype of post-Brexit visa,\nand a steady uptick in the\nmovement of Filipino\nand Nigerian migrants\ninto the UK on these\nvisas is hardly headline\nmaterial. 65,000 more care\nworkers later and the NHS\nand care system still have a plethora\nof problems. But this is still really\ngood, and I think it should be touted\nmore. 65,000 more people are now in\nemployment in the UK, earning more\nthan it\u2019s likely they could in their home\ncountry, filling some of the record\nnumber of job vacancies, caring for\npeople who can\u2019t care for themselves.\nIt should be celebrated by liberals\nas a triumph of immigration, and by\nconservatives as an economic win-win-win of Brexit.

The Musical, often heralded\nas the jewel in the crown of the golden age of American\nmusicals, is on the surface a jovial affair. Toe tapping\nbarn dances, cowboys, and little houses on the prairie,\non paper it commemorates the founding of the state\nof Oklahoma. It is therefore a declaration of American\nidentity, something that would have struck a chord in\na world war ravaged world in 1943 when it first premiered on Broadway.\nBut here the horrific underbelly of the musical is\nripped open. Out spill its guts, the violence, blood,\nand terror coiled at the heart of America like a maggot\nfeasting on decay.A transfer from America where the\nTony award winning production premiered, directors\nJordan Fish and Jordan Fein do away with the garlanded end stages of West End or Broadway theatres. Instead, the chameleonic Young Vic stage has been transformed into a wood panelled barn with audiences sat\neither side of the unraised stage. The whole production\nhas a stripped back aesthetic with even the orchestration reduced to an on stage eight-piece band. The horror pregnant within the musical, ignored in traditional\nproductions, is laid bare as a consequence.\nArthur Davrill\u2019s Curley starts as a boot strapping\neveryman in pursuit of the love of Anoushka Lucas\u2019\nwitty Laurey, serenading her and the audience with\ntypically heartfelt rendition of \u2018Oh, What a Beautiful\nMorning\u2019. In every other production he is the American hero, unquestionably good, handsome, and elo-quent.Butpeelingbacktheveneerlayerbylayerreveals\na predator who manipulates and pollutes the room\nwith his toxicity.\nIt is all there in the original; the unnerving relationship between Curly and Jud, a farm hand who is also in\nlove with Laurie, is usually glossed over with pageantry.\n\u2018PoreJudisDead\u2019isheremarkedbyadevastatinguseof\nlighting on behalf of lighting designer Scott Zielinski.\nThe room is plunged into total darkness. There is nothing but the language, the horror and cruelty of a bully,\nthe trembling fear of his victim. Patrick Vaill\u2019s Jud is\nan alienated loner. Whilst other productions celebrate\nhis ostracism from the community, this one deep dives\ninto his despair and his tragedy.\nThe creative team balance the tonal shifts perfect-ly. The dialectics of darkness and frivolity coexist in\nall their terrible beauty. Laurey\u2019s astoundingly chore-graphed dream sequence is a Lynchian nightmare with\ndancer Marie-Astrid Mence navigating a labyrinth\nof absurdist images. A lone electric guitar wails over\nher like a banshee, distorting the musical leitmotifs.\nEvoking Jimi Hendrix\u2019s Woodstock rendition of the\n\u2018Star-Spangled Banner\u2019, it is not just the music that is\ndistorted, but the ideology the music stands for.\nThe second the sequence is over, the cast spring\ninto an uncannily upbeat hoe-down. The shock lin-gers, painfully juxtaposed with the merriment. Daniel\nKluger must be applauded for injecting the score with\ndevastating electricity; his music is brought to life by a\npowerful cast of singers. Marisha Wallace particularly\nshines with her astute take on Ado Annie, her \u2018I Can\u2019t\nSay No\u2019 receiving a rapturous applause from the audi-ence.\nThis production a far cry from the Oklahoma! that\nonce was.

The Safer oil tanker\nhas sat stationary off the west coast of Yemen since 1987, when it was converted\nfrom oil tanker to stationary storage facility, with a capacity of around three\nmillion barrels. The war in Yemen has led the Houthi rebels, who consider the\ntanker their property, to neglect to keep the ship in good condition, and many\nnow fear that an oil spill, or an explosion, is imminent. The UN aim to use the\nfunds raised to offload over 1.14 million barrels of oil that have sat on the ship\nfor years. A spill could rank as one of the worst oil disasters of all time.\nEleven journalist killed in Mexico in 2022\nThe total number of journalists killed this year in Mexico continues to rise,\nas two more were gunned down in the town of Cosoleacaque on Monday.\nMexico, the most dangerous country for journalists outside of a war zone,\nhas experienced a monumental surge in the murder of journalists since the\nincumbent president Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador took office three years ago,\nand many critics condemn his handling of what has become a catastrophic and\nsustained attack on the press. L\u00f3pez Obrador has on multiple occasions publicly\nattacked journalists who he sees to be against his nationalist regime. Many cite\nthese attacks as partially responsible for the upsurge in the murder of journalists.\nUS moves to back Taiwan\nWith no announcement, the US State Department has removed a line from its\nwebsite stating that it does not support Taiwan\u2019s independence from China, in a\nmove described by Beijing as \u2018political manipulation\u2019. The CCP has long claimed\nTaiwan as part of China under its \u2018one China\u2019 vision, with many countries around\nthe world intentionally occupying a grey area where they neither support nor\ncondemn this claim.

Making shoes out of taxidermied\npigeons isn\u2019t one of them. Whilst the panel of judges\nadmitted that there probably were too many pigeons\nin central London, they firmly rejected the idea that\nexcess pigeons could be described as \u2018spare\u2019 and the\nentrant\u2019s reasoning that developing the shoes would\ncount as \u2018utilising otherwise wasted material\u2019. PETA\ncaught wind of the idea before it was announced to\nthe public and made a public statement against the\ndesign, stating that leaving the wings protruding from\neither side of the shoe was \u2018abhorrent, and impractical\nanyway\u2019 and that making each shoe into the shape of a\ngiant pigeon foot was \u2018science going too far\u2019.\nExcrement Powered eBikes\nThe contestant was not wrong when stating in their\ndesign plan that thermal energy is wasted when\nhuman excrement is simply flushed away. The judging\npanel reached an impasse, however, when considering\nStanley Jones\u2019s plan for eBikes powered by the heat\nof human excrement. Judges turned their heads away\nfrom the paper in disgust as they were shown a crudely drawn diagram of a portly man sitting naked atop a\nregular bike frame, with both of his outflows securely\nfastened to a modified seat. Chief judge Simon Heather\nsaid that the look of pleasure intricately drawn on the\nman\u2019s face \u2018took away from any sincerity in the design\u2019\nand that it was \u2018clearly what this contestant has put\nmost of his energy into\u2019, rather than the sustainability\nof the design. Others shown the design pointed out\nthat the 0.7 tonne biowaste reactor necessarily attached to the rear of the bike presented both ergonomic and financial issues.\nLandmark-to-landmark Human\nCannons\nFor centuries circuses across the globe have made\nuse of the human cannon as a feature of intrigue and\nhuman capability, drawing crowds from miles around.\nThe reaction to Lesley Aldern\u2019s Shard-to-Primrose\nHill carronade could not have been further from the\nstatus quo. Lesley, who achieved a D and F in GCSE\nmaths and physics respectively, submitted plans for\na cannon to be installed on the top floor of the shard\nand at the highest point of Primrose Hill to provide\n\u2018quick and easy transport across London at just the\ncost of a pound of gunpowder\u2019. Asking Lesley about the\nplans, judges quickly found that a safe landing was not\nsomething that had been considered pre-submission,\nwhen questions about a net to land in were met with\nrepeated shrugs.\nTrans-Thames Trebuchet\nHot off the back of laying waste to the human cannon\nidea, the judges came down on the similar, yet markedly worse, idea of a trebuchet to launch people across\nthe Thames. \u201cAside from the blatant health and safety\nissues, we already have bridges for this. There\u2019s, like,\nten bridges across the Thames through London that\nallow pedestrians to walk across. This idea would save\npeople about a one minute walk. The only idea more\nstupid than this would be a private company investing\nmillions in a cable car that carried people back and\nforth across the Thames with no purpose\u201d.\n\n"

They have since\nbeen trying to retrieve their records\nand sort out the system.\nThe report by Management\nConsultants Deloitte, Hoskins and\nSells states that there are 'serious\ninadequacies' in the accounting\npackage which the College installed\nin the Summer of 1986. It says that\nthe operating procedures had been\ntackled by 'extensive ad-hoc in house\ndevelopment' and the users had\nmodified the original package so\nmuch that it placed undue reliance on\nthe College resources. It is no longer\npossible to use the supplier's\nknowledge to fix any problems that\nnow occur with the package.\nThe problems with this system have\nresulted in bills going unpaid for\nnearly six months and suppliers\nrefusing to carry on delivering to the\nCollege.\nOne source told FELIX that the\nRefectories Section had to send out\n'runners' with manually-drawn\ncheques in order to secure deliveries\neach day.\nThe report suggests that the College\nrevert to a manual system for the rest\nof the financial year until the\nconfusion has been sorted out. It also\nsuggests that the present computing\nsystem should only be used for basic\naccounting functions until a totally\nnew accounting package, more suited\nto the College's needs, is installed for\nthe 1989/90 academic year.\nOne of its other recommendations\nis that 'outside assistance' might be\nrequired in order to have the end of\nyear accounts ready in time, which\nwill cost the College even more\nmoney.\nIt says that the departments should\ntake on more of the administration\nside of the finance system and\nrecommends that a pilot scheme on\nResearch Contract approval and\nOrder Production should be initiated.\nThe report indicates that this could be\ndone by de-centralising part of the\nFinance Section: 'a complement of 80\nstaff appears large to operate a\ncomputerised finance function in an\norganisation of Imperial's size'. It\nsuggests that some of the staff could\nbe transferred out to departments once\nthe current problems have been sorted\nout.\nIt is unknown, however, how much\nthe recent events have cost the\nCollege. As well as paying for the\noriginal accounting package and the\nextensive Management Consultants\nreport, a great deal of staff time has\nbeen spent trying to work the new\ncomputer system. Academics and\nadministrators have also had to spend\ntime chasing unpaid invoices through\nthe Finance Section, and explaining\nto suppliers about the problems.\nIt is also unclear as to how much\na new computer system that could\nfulfil the College's requirements\nwould cost.\nF\nFi\nir\nre\ne i\nin\nn L\nLi\nin\nns\nst\nte\nea\nad\nd\nPhew, what a scorcher!\nLinstead Hall in Princes Gardens was\nevacuated early on Wednesday\nmorning after a resident's room was\nset alight.\nWarren Duffin, a first year\nMathematics student, raised the alarm\nwhen his coffee maker caughtfireand\nspread to his curtains.

The biotechnological\nindustry surged at the beginning of\nthe 1970s as a result of the movement\nof highly qualified researchers from\nthe academic field to the corporate\nworld. The industry is international and\ndepends mostly on networks involving\nuniversities and financial companies.\nUniversities are responsible for\ncarrying out field research and creating\nknowledge that can then be used for the\ndevelopment of new technologies by\nbiotechnologicalcompanies.Meanwhile,\nhedge funds, private investors or any\nother financial organisation provide\nthem with the capital necessary\nto operate. The companies usually\ncombine research, manufacturing\nand distribution. However, a new\ntype of company has appeared\u2013 the\ndedicated biotechnological firm (DBF)\n\u2013 which acts as a bridge between\nresearchers and the \u2018economic part\u2019\n(investors. Retailers, etc.) That is to\nsay, DBF focuses on manufacturing.\nThe strategies that current\nbiotechnological companies apply are\nmanifold in such a competitive industry.\nJohnson & Johnson (who you might\nhave heard of from their COVID-19\nvaccine)isatitaninthebiotechnological\nindustry, with revenue of slightly over\n$91bn in 2021. This corporation follows\na decentralised model, giving great\nautonomy to the different branches\nthey have distributed across the globe.\nThis allows them to take fast decisions\nand tailor their products to the local\npopulation. Also, Johnson & Johnson\noffers a wide variety of products from\ndaily-use shampoos to innovative cancer\ntherapies. However, the diversification\nof both products and authority can\ndevolve into a lack of recognition for,\nand specialization within, the company.\nOn the other hand, we have the Chinese\ncompany Shanghai Pharmaceuticals,\nwhich earned over $25bn in 2021.\nShanghai Pharmaceuticals is the second\nbiggest pharmaceutical company and\nthe number one distributor of imported\ndrugs in China. In contrast to Johnson\n& Johnson, Shanghai Pharmaceuticals\nfollow a centralised and vertically-integrated model. This is seen as more\ntraditional, which is not necessarily bad.\nAclearandsolidhierarchymayhelpcreate\nbetter specialisation and organisation,\nas everyone knows their position in the\ncompany. This has allowed Shanghai\nPharmaceuticals to take over a great\nportion of the Chinese pharmaceutical\nindustry. However, there are also issues\nwith lack of autonomy and alienation,\ndeterring innovation and discouraging\ngame-changing people from joining the\ncompany. Also, a key difference between\nShanghai Pharmaceuticals and Western\nbiotechnological companies is that the\nformer also sells Traditional Chinese\nMedicine (TCM). This approach allows\nthemtoforgeastrongidentityamongthe\nChinese population and distinguishes\nthem from Western companies in the\nChinese pharmaceutical industry.\nThese two companies were founded\nbefore the 21st century, but many\nbiotechnological companies have\nemerged recently. Many are established\nwith the guidance of venture capitalists\ncompanies that provide them with\nresources and guidance. One of the\nmost outstanding examples of this\nis Moderna, founded in 2010 under\nthe hand of Flagship Pioneering. The\nobjective of Moderna from the very\nbeginning was to develop innovative\ndrugs using messenger RNA, which\nis a molecule essential to synthesis\nof proteins in the cell. This focus\non just one area of research allowed\nthem to out-perform their generic\ncompetitors and forge a reputation.\nHowever, it also narrowed their\nconsumer range, and this was reflected\nin their numbers. In 2018 and 2019,\nModerna was billing $113 and $60\nmillion, respectively. Then, with the\nboost of the COVID-19 vaccine, its\nrevenues rose dramatically to $803\nmillion in 2020. Moderna is an\nexception to the many cases of relatively\nnew biotechnological companies that\nstarted, exploded and then plummeted\nin a short time. We are living in an era\nwhen the biotechnological industry is\nmore volatile than ever before, because\nthe research is rapid, adding new areas of\ninvestments but also eliminating others.\nSome companies do not have the capital\nor infrastructure necessary to adapt to\nthesechangesandfail.Thevolatilityofthe\nbiotechnological industry is the perfect\nplayground for experienced speculative\ninvestors, but not for beginners. Even if\nthe novice investor wants to be involved\nin the biotechnological industry,\nthey should focus on well-established\nbrands like Johnson & Johnson\ninstead of predicting the next \u2018unicorn\u2019.\nThere are two main tendencies\ncurrently in the biotechnological\nindustry. First, traditional drug\ndevelopment targets medicines that\nare more effective for the majority of\nthe population. This will change in\nthe future due to the improvement of\ngenetic sequencing and engineering\ndrugs. Biotech companies will start\nfocusing on providing drugs tailored to\nthe genome of the individual, increasing\nexponentially the effectiveness of the\ntreatments. However, this will also mean\nthe halt of mass drug production and a\nradical change in research methodology.\nAlso,itwillbeamustforbiotechnological\ncompanies to accept and finish orders\nquickly, so decentralised models will\nprobably be more suitable. Secondly,\nthe world is facing a global food scarcity\nproblem because of the strengthening\nof crop pests and the depletion of the\ninternational reserves of phosphorus,\nessential to make fertilisers. Therefore,\nwe have to create more resistant and\nefficient crops to satisfy the demand of\na growing population. Biotechnological\ncompanies know this and they are\ninvesting more and more resources in\ngenetically modified crops and other\nsolutions.Thus,thefarmingindustrywill\nbe more related to, and dependant on,\nbiotechnology,whosevolatilitymightbe\nspreadtothefarmingindustrytoo.These\nare not more than suppositions though.\nThe evolution of the biotechnology industry\nWang Guo Staff Writer\nStaff Writer Wang Guo reflects on the growing sector that has rapidly evolved, and ponders its future\nPhoto credit: Up;padWizard., CC-BY-SA-4.0\n\n"

Often\nenough others were a little too interested what the dictator had on his mind, so\nthe Caesar cipher was born (ABCDE\u2026\nbecomes e.g., CDEFG\u2026). It has since\nfallen out of favour due to the ease with\nwhich it can be cracked, but was used as\nrecently as 1915 by the Russian army,\nwhose soldiers struggled to use more\nadvanced ciphers. Nonetheless, the Caesar cipher is still a particularly famous\nexample of an encryption technique.\nToday, encryption is more relevant\nthan ever \u2013 most of us use it daily without ever realising it. This article is the\nfirst in a three-part series examining its\nuses in digital communication. It will\nshow how encryption in digital communication works. The second article\nwill address why we should care about\nencryption, and the last one will provide\na how-to guide on securing your digital\nlife.\nTo understand different encryption\ntypes,imaginestandingwithmanyother\nstrangers at a river. You want to tell your\nfriendwhoisstandingontheontheoth-er side of the river something confidential \u2013 you have failed your last exam. In\nall scenarios we must look at two things:\nWho can access the information (let us\ncall this content data), and who can see\nthat a communication takes place (let us\ncall that meta data).\nMetadataisveryvaluableforanalytics\noperations in companies. It can be used\nto identify close contacts and offer personalised advertisements (your friend\nbought a MacBook so you may also be\ninterested). Governments and security\nagencies can use meta data to identify\ncontacts of criminals and other persons\nof interest.\n1) No encryption\nYour first option is to simply shout the\nmessage across the river. Other people\ncan see that you have communicated\nwith your friend (meta data) and can\neasily understand what you say (content\ndata).\n2) Transport encryption\nSecond scenario: You whisper to a\nfisherman on your side of the river that\nyou failed the last exam. He rows to the\nother side of the river, and passes the\nmessage to your friend by whispering in\nhis ear. This is already more secure, but\ntwo problems arise: You must trust the\nfishermanthatheisnottellinganyoneelse(hehasaccesstothecontentdata),andotherpeoplestillseethatyouhavetransferred\na message (meta data). This is most commonly used to encrypt emails.\n3) Symmetric encryption and End-to-End encryption (E2EE)\nThird scenario: as you and your friend\nare both nerds, you have developed a\nunique language. You either shout over\nthe river or use the fisherman \u2013 in both\nways only people who know the language\ncan understand you. This means your\nmessage itself is secured (content data).\nPeople still see that you send a message\nto your friend on the other river side (meta data), but you do not have to trust the fisherman anymore. This form of encryption\nis called symmetric encryption, where both sides use the same key (here the secret language) to transfer information. The new\nrisk is now that someone cracks the code and can understand the message, so let us look at the next level of encryption.\n4) Asymmetric encryption and End-to-End encryption (E2EE)\nFourth scenario, you both have created\ntwo mathematical keys, one public, one\nprivate key. Everyone shares their public\nkey openly, while keeping their private\nkey to themselves. When you have the\npublickeyofyourfriend,youcanencrypt\na message, shout it over (or send it with\nthe fisherman), and only your friend can\nopen the message with their private key. Your friend\u2019s public key and private key are mathematical connected, but it is virtually\nimpossible to guess the private key from knowing the public key.\nAsymmetric encryption is a standard in encryption, symmetric encryption is not considered secure anymore. Asymmetric\nencryption is used by WhatsApp, https websites, and bitcoin.\n5) Zero-Knowledge Principle (ZKP)\nFifth scenario, you do as in scenario four,\nbut this time you and your friend wear\nmasks so nobody knows who you are. In\nthis way, the information (content data)\nis secure, and one can see that a message\ngets transferred from the one river side\nto the other one, but it is impossible to\ntell who communicates with who (meta\ndata). This form of digital communication encryption is considered a gold standard. The most prominent communication\nservice that offers ZKP in addition to E2EE is Signal (messaging app like WhatsApp).\nSo, why should we care about\nencrypting our digital lives? Look\nout for my second article next week\nto find out!

Laurie O\u2019Garro, a string artist\nand teacher at the stall, described how she runs string art workshops for\nboth children and adults to escape the distractions of daily life.

However, the\n167th Boat Race may\nbe one of the last on\nits traditional course,\naccording to new\nplans by Fulham FC\nto build an 80m pier as\npart of their Riverside\nDevelopment.\nThe pier idea was first\nput forward in August\n2021 and a post on their\nwebsite details \u201cit is intended that a pier\nis created\u201d to \u201cconnect the Riverside\nStand development to central London.\u201d\n\u201cThe proposal is that the river bus\nservice from the Riverside Stand will\nform part of the existing network of\nriver bus services operating along the\nThames,providingriveraccessforleisure\nand commuter use to other parts of\nLondon as an alternative to road and rail\nservices.\u201d\nHowever, this has been met with\nextreme backlash from the local\ncommunity, on the basis this would\ncompletely prevent any water sports\non this stretch of river \u2013 threatening\nmany schools and clubs, including our\nown Imperial Boat Club. On race day,\nmany of the boat clubs and pubs along\nthe river encouraged people to sign a\npetition to \u201ckeep this stretch of water\nfocused on recreation, not commercial\nexploitation\u201d.\nPutney\u2019sMP,FleurAnderson,hasalso\nbeen strongly against\nthe development\nsaying it would make it\n\u201cimpossible and unsafe\nfor schools and clubs to\ncontinue sport on that\nstretch of the river\u201d.\nThis is not the first\ntime some of these boat\nclubs have been forced\nto move from the river.\nWestminster School\nBoat Club, reportedly\nthe oldest boat club\nin the world, with official records\nbeginning in 1813 with the names of\nthe boys who manned a six-oared boat\ncalled\u2018TheFly\u2019,wasoriginallybasednear\nthe school in Westminster but is now a\nneighbour of our boat club. Since then\nPutney has become a thriving centre for\nwater sports on the river and has over a\ncentury of its own traditions. Imperial\nCollege Boat Club itself was founded on\ntheembankmentin1919andisnowone\nof Imperial\u2019s biggest and most successful\nsport societies, with the top Women\u2019s 4\nwinning the Henley Women\u2019s Regatta\nlast year.\nThat\u2019s not to say the football club\nhasn\u2019t had a long history in the area.\nOriginally bought by Fulham in 1894,\nCraven Cottage held its first match in\nOctober 1896. The grounds themselves\nhave been upgraded many times since\nthen, but both the club and grounds\nhave never had any involvement with the\nriver.\nThe first part of their current\nredevelopment received planning\npermissionfromthecouncilaswellasthe\nPortofLondonAuthorityandtheMarine\nManagementOrganisationin2017.This\nsaw the reconstruction and extension of\nriverside stands by nine meters into the\nThames. They paid handsomely to do so,\nand so apparently,\nthe short answer to\nthe question, \u201ccan\nyou buy part of the\nriver Thames?\u201d, is\nyes. Original plans\nsaw many people\nand local clubs\nconcerned about\ntheprecedentbeing\nset of allowing\ncorporationstobuy\npart of the Thames and fears over the\nclub\u2019s encroachment into the river being\na slippery slope.\nThus, many people were unsurprised\nwhen plans, pictures and a website for\na new pier and pontoon service were\nreleased via Fulham FC\u2019s website,\ndespite the original report referring to\n\u2018minimising encroachment\u2019 no less than\nfour times in their Planning Application\nPlanning Summary.\nIn response to an article by the Daily\nMail, a Fulham FC spokesperson, said\nin contradiction to their website, \u2018\u2019For\nclarity, there is no proposal to extend a\npontoon 80 metres across the Thames\n(nor has there ever been) and there is\nabsolutelynoriskwhatsoevertotheboat\nrace.\u2019\u2019\n\u2018\u2019Fulham\u2019s design would, in addition\nto creating substantial and obvious\nbenefits to the local community, focus\non providing a wonderful viewing\nplatform which would enhance the\nboat race atmosphere, experience and\naccessibility.\u2019\u2019\nHowever, in order for the race to go\nahead this year safety buoys surrounding\nthe construction of the first part of the\nriverside development (the nine-metre\nextension) had to be removed so there\nwould be enough space on this already\nnarrow part of the river.\nThere is an existing pier within sight\nof the football club, that is currently\nserviced by Uber Boats. The benefit of a\nnew pier to ferry the fans of a single club\nseemsminimalandunrealistic,especially\ngiven the price difference in fares.\nSingle Adult Fare on Uber Boat:\n\u00a313.50 for all zones; \u00a38.70 for Central\nto West\nSingle Adult Tube\nFare zone 1-6: Peak\n\u00a35.10, Off Peak \u00a33.10\nWhat is certain is\nthe incompatibility of\nrowing and Thames\nClippers, especially\non a stretch of river\nused to introduce a\nlot of children to the\nsport.\nThe use of their\nengines while arriving and leaving causes\nwash severe enough to force experienced\nrowers to stop or risk serious damage to\ntheir equipment, which demonstrates\nthe problems the launches can cause\neven when stationary.

    "content": "KEEP THE CAT FREE\nArts.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\n12\nARTS\nAfter writing and directing an Oscar winning adaption of his play The Father, Florian Zeller returns\nto his theatrical roots with a new play premiering at\nthe Hampstead Theatre. As with his other offerings,\nThe Forest is a compelling psychodrama exploring the\nbreakdown of a family dynamic. In The Son it was di-vorce, in The Father it was dementia, now it is infidelity\nthat drives a nameless doctor further into a web of lies\nas he becomes entangled in an increasingly fraught affair behind his wife\u2019s back.\nPerhaps more so than his other plays, The Forest pushes the medium of theatre to its limit. Zeller\nand director Jonathan Kent pepper surreal elements\nthroughout the play that could have been lifted from a\nDavid Lynch film. Some scenes are mirrored, repeating\nthemselves but making slight adjustmentsin dialogue\nor character to make the audience question what is\nreal. Images and symbols double, again repeating with\nslight adjustments to add to the eeriness. The appearanceofanameless\u2018maninblack\u2019ispureLynchianmenace. Played by Finbar Lynch (probably of no relation\nto David Lynch), he appears as a manifestation of the\nprotagonist\u2019s unspeakable guilt, constantly haunting\nand terrorising his psyche. He even retroactively inserts\nhimself into past scenes through the play\u2019s brilliantly\njumbled chronology. Zeller treats his audience as psy-choanalysts; the play is sitting on our couch in need\nof analysis. We are not passively watching, but rather\nactively joining the dots to map out the tragedy and\nthe subtle terror as the play unravels. Only theatre can\nachieve this, when you are in the room face to face with\nthe drama. What results is a lingering sense of menace\ncreeping in the background of each scene that slowly\nculminates in a grisly finale.\nZeller and Kent play with theatricality by also splitting the nameless protagonist into two parts played by\nToby Stephens and Paul McCann. The decision keeps\nthe audience on its toes and makes their descent into a\ncerebral abyss more captivating. But it is Gina McKee\nas the nameless protagonist\u2019s wife who steals the show.\nHer performance is deeply layer with Pinteresque ten-sion, never revealing whether her character knows\nabout her husband\u2019s infidelity. Talking of Pinter, there\nisnobetterplacetopayhomagetotheNobelprizewin-ning playwright with her elongated silence (a \u2018Pinter\npause\u2019) in the final scene than the Hampstead Theatre\nwhere many of his plays premiered.
