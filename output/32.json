The American Debate on Thursday31 st January was astonishingly well advertised, and it is assumed that everybody knew about it. The150 who attended know it was eminently enjoyable, and the1500 who\ndidn't don't. We a retired of describing debates to people who don't attend them. EAST& WEST In the second very good talk of this series, Dr. Doreen Warr in er examined the dilemma of the West arising out of the tension between the apparent needs of strategic defence and our sense of basic values. There was one half of the world that wanted only to remain neutral to the East West conflict, while developing their social and economic standards. Yet while the Soviet Union could appeal to these people with calls of national independence, land reform, and social and economic progress( not always inline with Communist doctrine), the West was regarded as symbolising domination and main ten an oe of the status quo.It was essential to establish a firm belief in our Ideals, and to find a strete g lo policy consistent with them. In trying to impose freedom there is a danger of destroying it. The discussion was an improvement on the previous one, and even more lively, but still lacked penetration \u20220n \u00aband a half hours is hardly sufficient to pass the preliminary stage where people let off their pet ideas Perseverance to the third and fourth hours might be productive'. Still, practice makes perfect. On Wednesday Feb.20 th, Mr Geoffrey Goodwin( L.S.E.) while considering also the ideas of various philosophers, will discuss\" Idealism arad Reality in International Politics\". We look forward to a third helpful meeting and hope that all Interested will make\nan effort to be present despite its being aWed nes dav( Zoology Lect. Th.)w rik Sammy N.L. Samways is ih cone name nearest to the hearts of all members of this college that is, of course, assuming that we all carry our Union membership cards in our breast pockets. The only other word on many\nof those cards is FULL an a that in its turn describes precisely his contribution to the life of this college. FEUX n*t \u201e\nNorman\" Sammy\" Sam way s,Wam says or Sam wort for so his numerous foreign correspondents have addressed him was born at the end of1927 in Bath not many miles from the birthplace of his predecessor to the chair of the A.C.C., Spud Hayter. His school life was spent at. Bath, Enfield and Peterborough and he now resides at Reading.\" BeI Berkshire?\" No, sir, Somerset his native county still finds in him a loyal supporter. He came to the Mines in1946 and took a second in Metallurgy in1949. This year he writes his thesis on the solidification of metals, at the end of a course of research described as\" building sandcastles, mostly in the air, and measuring their temperatures\". He has had three girlfriends. To print a completelist of the off ic e she has held in his six years a tI.C. would require a supplement to Felix. He was captain of the R.S. M. Athletic Club which won the Sports Day in1949, he captained the I.C. Athletic Club in194950, was Chairman of. the A.C.C. in the following year and is the present Hon. Secretary of I.C. Union. He has served on twenty committees. Undergraduate vacation work was enjoyed in Ipswich where her an and played cricket, in Sweden where he toiled in a steel milland in Norway where he worked with David Evans in a whaling factory ship. Correction; he has had four girlfriends His command of the Scandinavian languages, usually sound, becomes startling as the night progresses and he claims that his stock phrase,\" Kan de for st a?\" has carried him through Denmark and France on his recent visits. Denmark sorry, Norman has had eight girlfriends. His sporting interests are not confined to athletics. When I. C.had two rug ger team she played in the second; when they had three he played in the third; last year he was captain of the fifth XV. His best game ever was against the R.S. M. XV when he hooked for Saracens' Nomads and had complete possession in the tight. His second row consisted of J.R. C. Mathews and David Brookes'. In1949 he lived in the old hostel. In195.0 he moved to a room overlooking Q.A.( nine girlfriends, that is) and is now raising the standard of culture by loaning out many of his fine collection of literara ry works to the first floor of the new hostel. Mozart and Beethoven rank high among his favourite composers; the\" modern s'' rank low. He dislikes tried tomatoes and sea voyages. Politically Liberal, he holds liberal views on Union policy. He has done everything from supervising an athletic tour to Denmark and representing England in the400 metres in Norway to falling forty feet down a quarry and landing in a bush. He has even burned holes in the evening dress of the President of I. C.W. A. by throwing white hot metal at her. Of such is Sammy. His somewhat retiring manner his gift of putting others before himself and his air of quiet efficiency make him indeed near to the hearts of all who play, run or work with him.

Parks ran his best race this season, running second until the last half mile, when he dropped back to fifth; Gar rod was\nfirst man home for I.e., moving up from sixth to third near the finish.

SOCCER C.& G.4R.C. S.g. The2 nd. game of the technology Cup series was played on Wed.30 th. Jan. between Guilds and R.C.S. The match was watched by two cripples and a President, who went off to play some other game. The ground had been frozen very hard but as light thawing of the top surface made it more of a skating rink than a football pitch. These conditions did not encourage good football but the Guilds \u2022\nteam, who adapted themselves to the conditions better, won the match. At the kickoff the R.C'S. to Q k the ad Marr te ge and were unlucky not to have an a a rly goal. The Guilds team settled down and a nicely taken goal by Brody put them in the lead. This was Quickly followed by goals from Hodge and Jewitt and it looked as if rout would follow. However the R.C.S. defence, which had been very panicky up till then, was rallied by the captain Buck roy d, and the R.C.S. struck back with goals by Jackson and C len shaw. It was still anybody' s game and this was the score at halftime. After halftime both teams were now used to the conditions and the play ranged frome 'Ld to end without either side looking like scoring. \u00ab . f ter27 minutes of the second' half Wheeler Cut in from from the rightwing and, with an amazing lob beat the R;C.S. goalkeeper to give the Guilds a two\ngoal lead.

The cup will be presented at the dinner the same evening. IC WSC It is hoped, through this article to put Imperial College Women's SportsClub on the man. This year, we are struggling manfully( I) to maintain a niche in the University sporting world. There are,as you probably know, very few\nwomen in imperial College, only25 out of40 being in the sportsclub.( There are only19 undergraduate women at this College.) From this pool, we fia ld netball, squash, hockey, badminton, table tennis and tennis teams. To help pull us through, we usually depend on a few really good players, but this year,s ad to tell, we merge very much on the mediocrity. Hence the results are not as good as we could wish. However, we have one attribute which counts high. We always play as a unit. This arises partly because\" everybody knows everybody\" and partly because of our precarious position. Finally, I wan,t to say that I am sure we in no\nway discredit the famous initial sI.C. Wish us Luck. E. Rae Turnbull.( Pre s.I.C. W.S.C.19512) TABLE TENNIS The Table Tennis Club have had a reasonably successful season up to the present time. The l st team is at present top of the Premier division of the University League and the2 nd team are3 rd in Division I. In Division II th.e3rd team occupy a rather low position owing to the fact that as many players as possible have been given league experience. The membership th ds year is approximately60 and out of these16 have entered for the University Championships being held this month. One of the l st team members has represented the University on six occasions during the current season. After an extremely long delay one of the tables has at last been collected for resurfacing and should be back in about six weeks. Throughout the year a ladder tournament has been held, many of the games being played off in the dinner hour. The annual club championships will be held in the near future and members wishing to enter should see the noticeboard for further particulars.

    "content": "FELIX\nYifiiupoijit- Sf TOENT\nCONVERSATION Preface T\" feel It is only fair to state here and now\nthat if yon read this article and find it to he nothing more than a chain of platitudes labour ed into a fabric of pseudo sophisticated hypocrisy, Iha reproved my case. Moreover if having read the last dying epithet you are still unaware af the case I am presenting, then I am afraid your defeat is irrevocable. This renders the whole affair singularly unsatisfactory, since I remain the only person to be convinced of my victory, and you who are defeated will,i nyc far ignorance, subject me to endless humiliation. Here am I, trying to write about student conversation in I.C. and all I can think of is a joke about a wheelbarrow,\nwhich if reproduced would cause considerable pain and anxiety as to my future. How can I, moulded according to Imperial Preference, my own ideas a product of other people' sido as, hope to bring an interesting viewpoint on the conversation which causes the viewpoint, when the conversation does'nt take place. Let me try to summarise the subjects which one could talk about. First of all there is Scientific theory. One would\nimagine that students who are required to have a knowledge of both theory and fact would discuss the theory and learn the facts at home. But for some obscure reason - probably sheer\ncus aed ness they never mention theory in public, and conversations on scientific topics seem to be concerned largely with isolated facts which are all exhaustively described into xt books and could ri't provide an interesting conversation of more than two sentences even if Oscar Wilds' s life depended\non it. Politics almost the same state of affairs. Either you are part of an infinitesimal minority which takes its minority view to extremes of seriousness, or you allow yourself en occasional remark about how loathsome the Egyptians are, which nobody contradicts for fear of being a \"Union Bore\".As for art, well nobody has any facts, let' alone theory. Since\n\"Wozzeek\" was first produced a few weeks ago I have heard just two comments (a)\" Monstrous\",( b)a sort of apologetics mile with a cynical twist which could mean anything and nothing. I'm no fan of \"Jozzeok so lets try Jazz, symphony music, point fc if i, sculpture, poetry.\" Yes, I liked it\".' Ho,I didn't like it\".\" Pleasant\"}\" nice\",\" shocking\",\" monstrous\",\" fantastic\",\" i vibo li sv able\" and on, and on. \" o wonder the English language\nhas ru oha wealth of adjectives, you can talk for minutes with out thinking end still avoiding repeating yourself. It would be easy to an cri be this doting on self evident fact to the scientific lack of imagination, but that is sheer\nwishful thinking of a suicidal nature. Its something in the Imperial Air. V.'ela d; the contrast which stimulates conversation, every body becomes stamped villi a decree of sameness, and a uniform\ngrc y.i ess seems to steal over everything. My mind thinks in term3 of col pur when faced with this problem. I see other\ncolleges as a mass of contrasting colours, lurid in cases, nay be even hysterical, but we a tI.C. seem to have run together into n misty grey. Other colleges assimilate their surroundings; but we seem to have assumed the Character of the land scape.\nL'y own feeling is that the resolution of this mess rests largely with the academic staff,, and the college authorities, but our own awareness of the problem as students will help to force the pace. So even if we never have any conversation about anything else, let's try to discuss the reason. Who\nImows? Somebody might even change the subject.

    "content": "4\nFEL1X\nT/V01 NOT T/V The quin qu age nary meeting of the Association of I Crystal Set Designers was held in the bar of\" The Crown and Diode\", Dr. Kat swi sker being in the chair. He opened by stating that since the last meeting in19 o2 the number of programmes now being transmitted over the air was far greater than the number of cats' I whiskers available to receive them.:: Professor Pr iggy commented that this shortage of cats was deplorable and was no doubt due to the Ministry of Housing's strict control of tiles and other building material. Mr. Macaroni the famous Italian member then stated that although ordinary wireless was still very popular a new craze had developed called T./V. The chairman asked if it would be a good idea if the meeting should discuss this new medium. Mr. Turn it off the Russian representative said that although none of the members had a clear view of what actually happened he was sure that an interesting discussion would take place. The first question was asked by Mr. Macaroni who said\" if light travels faster than sound, how\ndo they both arrive at the T./V. set at the same\ntime?\" Mr. Ferr m anti suggested that this difficulty was overcome by saying the thing first and then doing the appropriate actions at a calculated delayed time afterwards. Miss Ke6. Ohm state u that this was impracticable due to the distances of transmitter and receivers, needing different time delays. She believed that it was overcome by the use of a rather unusual' H' shaped aerial where one vertical bar caught th ie light and the other caught the sound, the horizontal bar serving to hold the two apart and also to catch anything else that happened to be passing. She had also noted that one bar was always nearer to the transmitter than the other and thus the light which arrived fir it would have further to go\nthan the sound and it was a simple matter to adjust for the different times of arrival of the light and sound by alter iii g the distance between the two aerial s.ir. Ferr m anti then said that although some very good points had been raised nobody had tried to explain how a clear picture was transmitted on a foggy day. Professor Pr iggy suggested that it was sent by underground but he was quickly answered by Miss Dina Moe who stated that although it was very easy in the London area it could not be done in her home town as the underground system was a disgrace especially at rush hours. Dr. Kat swi sker asked whether T./V. could be picked upon the normal crystal set and if not how could this Mr. Far a night said he saw no reason why this should not be done using a shorter whisker to compensate for the shorter waves used. This he said was in keeping with Fleming s\" two finger\" rule which states: Waves per unit area of whisker \u2022 k, ke X a \u00a3 Sin tot * IO *\n4 5 Cos p,/ \u00bb '\nwhere Ic,, ( r,, \u00a3 are known as Kaiser s constants and depend on the colour of the whisker and the age of the cat. Miss Meg. Ohm said she had carried out several tests with different apparatuses and obtained the best ve sul ts when her resistance was low. Professor Pr iggy could not see how questions of ethics could affect the issue, but he found the theory most suggestive, and would be delighted to test it at some later date. Continued at foot of next col unn R.C.S. SCIENTIFIC JOURNAL In1915, Volume I of the Journal of the Royal College of Science Chemical Society was published. Volume2 appeared in1923, and the Journal thereafter appeared annually, the title being changed in1925to the Journal of the Imperial College Chemical Society. In1931, Volume10 of this Journal was incorporated into Volume I of the Scientific Journal of the Royal College of Science, which included lectures delivered before the Natural History Society and the Mathematical and Physical Society. Since then, this Journal has appeared annually, even throughout the difficult war years. It has always been a student publication, financed by the R.C.S. Union. The reason for its appearance was stated in Volume It obe due to a conviction\" that the best lectures of the session before the societies are worthy of permanent record and wide distribution\", and this has remained the guiding principle of subsequent Publication Boards. Moreover, the Editorial to Volume I ends with these words:' The boundaries of the sciences are but vaguely defined, and it is in keeping with the trend of modern science that we make this effort to satisfy the widening outlook of students.' Despite this, however, it is unfortunately true to say that the Journal has in the past suffered because of the specialized nature of most of the lectures published. The outlook of students is possibly wider than it was In1931, and in recent years a number of lectures of very general interest have appeared; for instance' A Scientific Approach to European< V itch craft1,' Non Euclidean Geometry and Scientific Thought', and' The Impact of Modern Physics on Christian Faith' from Volume19. The lectures by Professor Pol any i( The Nature of Scientific Convictions) and the Rector( The Giessen Spirit) from Volume2 c, and' The Age of Newton' from Volume21( the 1951\nEdition, which will be appearing shortly) ail fall into the same category and should be of great interest to all scientists. It is hoped that the other, more specialized, lectures are also of interest to a large mri ber of students. vj hil st the Journal is published primarily for the benefit of students of the College, it has a considerable external sale. It is purchased by\nindividual subscribers and by Libraries( academic., industrial and public) throughout the Commonwealth. Most of our foreign orders come, of course, from America, but copies are also sent to France, Germany, Sweden, Russia etc. It is evident that the\nJournal has a very high standing amongst publications of its kind and it cannot fail to enhance the Worldwide pre3 t lge of the College. LEARNING AND LAUGHING\nThe Film Society are holding their first lecture of the session on February19 th. The speaker will be Mr. R.F. Privet t, of the Halas Batch el or Company; his subject the making of cartoon films; and the place the Mining Lecture Theatre, at5.05 p.m. Everybody will be welcome to come and hear Mr. Privet t, whose talk will be illustrated by several cartoons intended to amuse and instruct at the same time. This talk should be of particular interest as Halas Batch el or are, now England' s sole cartoon producers, since J. Arthur Rank's economy cuts felled David Hand's productions. Moreover they are engaged on their first feature length cartoon, which is reported to be George Or well's delightful satire\" Animal Farm\". Back numbers of FELIX once more iVe have now completed the set of FELIX' for the University Goldsmith'3 Library, and would like to thank those who contributed to this gift. For the Union Library we still lack Nos.25. \"The University: where they teach tradition and sub-traction\" \"Jake It Prom Here.' Continued from previous column Mr. Macaroni said that in order to compensate for the higher frequency waves he used a whisker with a variable/*< in order to keep the\" whisk o city\" factor high. He had also used a black and white striped whisker but this tended to slow things down somewhat\nowing to the fact that it resembled a zebra crossing. Time being up the meeting was then adjourned for50 years. A.L. tt. G.A;K.3\"., C&3U. "

CUP CHANCE\nRUG GER CLUB IN SEMIFINAL I.G. defeated C.E.M. by J pts( one try) to nil in the\nreplay a tR arlington and so advance to the semifinal, in wh i oh they will meet L.S.E. The game was closely contested but the College had much the better of it territorial ly, and\ndeserved to win. The only try was soo red wide out on the left by Crossley after a period of heavy pressure by the I.C. forwards in the\nmiddle of the first half. The treacherous surface prevented\neither set of backs from developing dangerous attacks in the\nopen.and the issue was decided by I.C.'s superiority in the\npack. The forwards were not always as well supported by\nto u oh finding kicks as they should have been;and on three\noccasions defensive lapses by halves and three quarters cost fifty yards of ground through foot rushes, which were\nstopped with difficulty. If the semifinal is played in s iai lar conditions more\nuse should be made of kicking to get the forwards into the\nopponents ' 2 5 ' \u2022 Then,with quicker heeling from the loose and a tightened defence,we should reach the final for the\nfirst time since the war.\nU.L JJ. COUNCIL The third meeting of this year' sU.L.U. Cou nci J spent most of its energies on the final stages of adopting a new constitution, which will probably come into operation for next year to merge the two present separate bodies, the University of London Union, and the U.L. Athletic Union, under the former title. At present 29 colleges subscribe to both unions, but a further14( L.S.E., find \"the Hospitals\") belong toU.L. A.U. only, w hio his divided into Men's and Women's Branches. It is interesting to note that the U.L. U. Diary lists the University as composed of:5 University Departments; 2 In corp o rated Colleges, U.C. and K.O.:33 Schools of the University, including I.C.; and 22 \" Institutions Having Recognised\nTeachers\", i.e. the Polytechnics, Training Colleges, etc.; a total of 62,\nU. L.A.U. was founded in1906, fifteen years before the beginnings of U.L. U. They receive their incomes separately from the Colleges Unions. The Athletic Union is at present\ncontrolled by committees composed of Club Captains, College Representatives, and officers elected by the two Branches. U.L.U.i s governed by a Council of College Representatives, the number from each varying with the size of the college from two to four. These two bodies are linked by an inter change of Officers. The new Union would be run by a single Council composed\nof College Presidents and the Officers of the Athletic Branches\nThe greatest amount of attention to framing the new constitution has been spent on financial arrangements: the temporary\nProposition is that the allocations of the future Council between the athletic end social sides shall be supervised by\na Union Court for atrial period of five years. This Court\nwould be composed of three members appointed by the Senate,\nthe Warden (the Union's adviser on University affairs), the U.L. U. Officers and the Junior Treasurers of both sections of the Union. The income would be collected by the University Authorities, The Athletic Union, no longer to have complete control of their own income, feel that this arrangement will give the new Council' a chance to prove their competence to spend fairly. Nobody doubts that they will. The Council had earlier received a number of reports which are summarised as below:\nThe Entertainments Committee stated that only one third of the colleges supported the then imminent Jamaica Relief Ball; the Publicity C tte. presented designs for aU.L. U. badge\nbut the idea wa B then rejected on principle. The Council agreed to have the new scarf vetted by more colleges. The decision on it was left to the next meeting. It was also.. reported that the Evening Standard had appointed the writer of its recent feature on the University, as University Correspondent. Continued. Mr. Morris pulled out all the stops in winding up for the proposition. War cannot achieve anything good, let us try something new before it is too late. On the division the motion was carried by64 vote s,*o36 with3 abstentions.64 WONT FIGHT U.L. DEBATE RESULT The motion that' This house will not fight in any war' drew a surprisingly small crowd of150 to the U.L. U. debate on February1 st. This may have been because the motion did not appeal to any organised body in the University, or because Pacifism does not arouse any strong feeling, one way or another, in the average student. The motion was proposed by Mr. Stuart Morris, the secretary of the Peace Pledge Union, in an impassioned speech.' Before the Peace Treaty of the last war has been signed,' he said,' we are rearming Germany and Japan in preparation for a new worldwar, while even now four local wars are in progress! War, as a solution to the world's problems, has been judged by its results and found wanting. Communism, our latest enemy, is an idea and can be defeated only by other ideas and not by war. The real force against which fighting is now going on is that of subjugated peoples struggling for fx-e edom from hunger and disease. Instead of spending money on arms we should be\nproviding more food and medicine for the needy peoples of the world. To break the vicious circle of fear in which every government in the world is caught Britain should disarm and point the way to ax alternative to war constructive instead of destructive. In a much more subdued, not to say pedestrian speech, Lord, Strabo lg i opposed the motion. After remarking that we had heard the arguments for the proposition many times before in the past forty years he went on to divide wars into categories. Some types such as dynastic wars are outmoded, aggressive wars are to be condemned but wars of liberation and of self defence are certainly justified. War as a method for settling international differences is out of date but the new\nmethods such as U.N.O. can only succeed if they are given full support. Just as on a personal level self defence is sometimes necessary soon a national level resistance to aggression is also sometimes necessary. Even an international court would have to have military power behind it to be\neffective. Seconding the proposition, Mr. Eric So bins on, of Birk beck College, differentiated between nonviolence and non resistance. Pacifists advocated the former but not the latter. It is a fallacy that war ennoble saman, it is part of the false glamor is ation of war that glosses over its miseries and suffering. If we accept war we must also accept responsibility for all the deaths caused by war. Mr. David Mitchell, President of King's College Union, seconded the opposition. If we\nrefuse to fight we must accept the responsibility of the resultant slavery. People' side as cannot be changed merely by disarming and our way of life is good enough to be encouraged and defended, by\nforce of arms if necessary. Finally, Christianity is a militant religion and encourages resistance against aggression by the anti christian. From the floor of the House the speeches were mostly in support of the motion. The support for Pacifism ranged from the practical that our preparation for war is itself threatening the economic stability of our civilization and that everybody is always worse off after a war, to the idealistic the only way to answer violence is with unremitting Love. The power of nonviolent resistance was illustrated by the way in which the German troops were de moral is ed by the civilian population of Norway who used this technique during the occupation. Opposers of the motion suggested that pacifism was misguided courage. In the summing up Lord Strabo lg i reminded the House that if Pacifism had won the day in1939 they would not have been able to hold the present debate. Pacifism is utterly impracticable. We\nall want world peace but Pacifism is not the way. Continued in adjoining column.\n\n"

Students collected early in the lunch hour, where notices of postponed and cancelled events were already beginning to appear, and a large, silent crowd assembled in the lounge to hear the B.B.C. Hews a to neo' clock. All sports activities for Wednesday, and social items for the week were cancelled or postponed. At the weekend the sportsclub s followed the examples of their national associations, and social events ceased until the end of the week of. the Funeral. The University Union decided to cancel their programmes likewise. The R.C.S. Carnival and the L.U.D. S. One Act Play Festival were abandoned, and the U.L. Jamaica Relief Ball was postponed until March14 th. The King was Visitor to the College, having been present on October25 th.,1946,at the Centenary celebrations held in the Albert Hall; and this occasion is now remembered each year at Commemoration Day. A message of sympathy and loyalty was sent to the new Queen by Viscount Falmouth, Chairman of the Governing Body, on behalf of the Governors, the Staff, and the Students. We hope to be able to publish the text of this message together with the reply in a later issue. LIVING LOCALLY\nOne of the most general problems of universities today\nis the acute shortage of hostel space, and many people consider a student uh olives away from his fellows is not a full member of the university. I.G. is luckier than the most central colleges King's and the Bloomsbury group -in that we are on the borders of the mass residential areas, and It is our opinion that more students could live near\ncollege if they spent some time looking for rooms. When\nwe argued this last year, examples were cited of two members\nof the Editorial Board who had independently obtained rooms\nat 30/- per week within a stone's throw of the college and\nof my taking up the26/ share of a flat in the.same road.\nThis vacancy had been advertised for a month in FELIX before\nI woke up; there is justification for stirring you. Since then two more people have found places as near, and in all these cases of semi residents, feeding is made easy by the\nnearness of the college refectory, and virtually all travelling time and money is saved. But cheap rooms are not advertised, and few good diggings are easily available below\n40/-, even with the help of the University Lodgings Bureau. This auxiliary hostel comprises two rooms, one enormity\n29 ft. square, and a large kitchen dining room. Ths3e are the first and second floor arrangements of most of the ter race houses around I.C. white elephants as flats until partitioned into four rooms; except for use by three or four students. A set of built in cupboards occupies one\nentire wall of the large room, there is a pair of beds along\neach sidewall, remote from the sitting room in the middle\ncentred around the excellent gas fire. The kitchen houses\nstove, cupboards and sink, table and s of a; and ten eaters\nif forced. My share of meal costs, gas and other running expenses is16/ per week during atypical period when I took all my weekday lunches and half my suppers out. The\nrent and electricity bill comes to25/ per week. Minor capital purchases occur, but they remain our property,( whose,\nin particular, has not yet arisen). The degree of furnishing depends upon one's landlord, but it can be improved by\ncondemned carpets from home etc. As regards shopping and\nsweeping - one makes one's own bed and lives in it. PURSUED0NAHE3\nDear Sir,I have noticed a distressing tendency on the part of your subscribers to the\" Letters\" column, to sign themselves with a miscellaneous collection of pen names. This revolting habit i3 barely excusable, even if the contributor has a horrid appellation he is secretly ashamed of. Shall we\nsoon degrade ourselves a little more, and emulate the style of a certain daily newspaper, which regularly refers to its readers as\" ducks\" and its editors( if any) as\"us old codgers\"?( on behalf of\" VOX POP UL I\")T \u00b0 UrS.. Mg gu3t ed.. LETTERS TO THE EDITOR COLLEGE MUSICAL ACTIVITIES Dear Sir, Let me firstly applaud your action of having found a Music Critic who will,I hope, give us unbiased views of all the varied musical activities in the College. But it is unfortunate that in his first article he should have made a deplorable error. The Musical Society do in fact again hold Gramophone Recitals on Tuesdays at1.15 p.m. The lending library of over2 oo records is open at the same time. The Society has also planned several lecture meetings, among which we hope to have one by Dobson and Young who were so popular both on the B.B.C. and with the Forces. Your set c.,D.B. t f.I.C. Musical Society. Reply by FELIX' S Music Correspondent. While thanking Miss Will rich for drawing attention to the error in my article last week 1 must however point out that the recitals she refers to are carried out in the lunch hour when many persons who\nare interested are unable to attend. Moreover the recitals are held in one of the Committee rooms which cannot in any way be termed Ideal surroundings, either aesthetically, acoustically, or comfortably. Those members of I.C. who heard Mr. Leak's demonstration to the Radio Society will know that a large room or lecture theatre is capable of being turned into a concert hall, and the reproduction obtained on suitable apparatus is such as to render the sound absolutely indistinguishable from alive performance.1 am pleased to hear that Dob so u and Kou ng sire\nto lecture here but as they always use a battered acoustic gramophone, even when on the B.B.C.,I am\ninclined to treat them as exceptional. Other lecturers who do not have this i dio sync racy may not be so easy to accommodate. SPORT! TRUMPET BLOWING. Sir, As can be seen from the last issue of\" Felix\", I.C. have the two best Trumpeters in the whole of U.I. Unfortunately this week's efforts must remain muted, because playing away at For tT is simo on loaned instruments it was found that they can only blow their own Trumpets. Yours etc., A. SUCKER. REFECTORY FACILITIES Dear Sir, We are glad to learn of the Refectory Committee's recent investigation into the catering standards a tI.C. It is our opinion that not only is the food substandard but that the seating ac como dati on in the New\nLounge is, to say the least, inadequate. At those restricted hours of the daywhen the New Lounge is functioning, as many as half its occupants are obliged to stand. We feel that some of the Committee's energies could Usefully be directed to the solution of this problem. We are, Yours faithfully, K.N. BROWH\nJ. H. STEVENSON\n( Eds. Note: The question of the use of the New\nLounge is to be brought up at a Union meeting.) FELIX Sir, Felix is intended to be a reflection of our life a tI.e., but need this continue further? Is it true that even this member of our fraternity( meaning no disrespect to I. C.W. A.) has to graduate? The history of Felix is, so far, a very close parallel to undergraduate life. The first year at college saw afresh frivolous Felix making new acquaintances quickly, and enlarging his outlook to cover as near every Union activity as possible. During the second year our feline undergraduate lost his immature frivolity and developed a ripe( even if smelly at times) humour, which turned mere acquaintance into friendship, so that even the staff turned a friendly eye. Now comes the third year, and I note with dismay that sobering down, and that anxiety not to offend which makes some 3 rd year people so uninteresting. Still walking, it is true,( just) but I wonder whether Felix will pass the coming test, to stay, as so many postgraduates do, forever. Yours correspondingly, J. W. Saunders. "
