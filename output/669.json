    "content": "Fight for\nBetter Pay!\nDear Sir\nThe letter from NUPE in\nyour last issue reflects their\nconcern for their members who\nare in a low pay sector of the\nUniversities. We hope you will\npress the College to answer it.\n\u00bb Students will know that the\nprocess of drawing conclusions\n\u2022 from data has to be carried out\nwith care. Thus despite the\n\u2022''higher average costs for staff\nother than NUPE members,\nmany of the ASTMS members\nin the technical staff qualify for\nsocial security benefits; for\nexample, free milk for their\nchildren. Members of the\nCollege staff with a son or\ndaughter at University\nprobably suffer the worst\nfinancially since the student's income to the family is so low.\nThus an immediate consequence of the figures which\nrelate to staff costs but tend to.\nsuggest salary is that the plight\nof students is far worse. The\nlogic of the NUPE letter leads to\nthe conclusion that all the\nCollege staff should supplement student grants, since\nstudents are the lowest paid\nsector of the Universities.\nThe truth of the matter is that\nthe premise of the NUPE letter\nregarding the fixed percentage\nof the College Income being\ntaken by wages and salary is\nfalse. For most College staff\ntheir salaries are determined on\na national basis and therefore\ncannot be constrained by a College policy. Also it is\ncommon justice that those who\nhave a long training period\nshould have higher salaries\nwhen at work so as to\ncompensate them for the long\nperiod when they earned so\nlittle.\nWe welcome the initiative of\nNUPE in entering the generality\nof the matter. The financial\nstrategy of the College1\nregarding its staff is a general\narea for debate. Consequent\nupon this is the financial\nstrategy of HM Government\ntowards Universities, their staff\nand their students. This is of\ngreater importance.\nIt is our opinion that\nUniversities should be in the\n'investment' sector of the\neconomy and not in the\n'charity' sector as they now are.\nOnly if such steps are taken by\nPage 2 WMWkWkWMBMMMM\nthe Government will it be\npossible to deal adequately with\nthe question of low pay within\nthe University sector.\nYours sincerely\nHarry Fairbrother\nPresident, ICASTMS\nNo Ransom\nfor 'Smelly\nBeaver'\nDear FELIX\nHaving read your article on\nthe capture of Bruce the Beaver\nI am writing to correct your\ninaccuracies. LSE Students'\nUnion will not pay any ransom\nin the near future until\neverything is verified. In the\npast Bruce has been kidnapped\nby other colleges, most recently\nby King's, but usually has been\nreturned without a ransom\nbeing paid. One reason for this\nis that the Beaver smells (not as\nmuch now).\nIncidently FELIX seems to\nbe suffering from an overdose\nof student politics\u2014a common\ninfliction. Every issue the letters\ncolumn is used by seasoned\nhacks to slag off their\nopponents. This should be\navoided if FELIX wants to be a good student newspaper (unlike\nLondon Student).\nYours sincerely\nMann Kee Li\nOverseas Students Executive\nOfficer, LSE Student Union\nPeace\nthrough\nsubmission\nto God\nDear Pallab\nI read your article 'God\nExists\u2014Official' in last week's FELIX. Having also attended a part of the Debsoc lecture in\nwhich there was complete\ndiscord between speakers and\nthe audience as to the question\nof the existance of God, I thought I must point out to all\nthose who are earnestly seeking\nTruth that the Qur'an, the last\nrevealed Book (which unlike\nthe Old Testament and Gospel,\nis still intact in its original\npristine form), answers the\nquestion posed in the debate,\nand goes on to give a complete\ncode of life for those who wish\nto achieve peace through\nsubmission to God both in this\nworld and the Hereafter. The\nQur'an is freely available and its\nmeaning has been translated\ninto English.\nYours sincerely\nT Sheriff\nChem PG 1\nWhy I Quit-Neild\nDear Pallab\nAt yesterday's Hustings\nUG M,I announced my\ndecision to stand down from the\nelections for Deputy President.\nThis leaves the post to be filled\nunopposed, by Dave Parry, the\npresent Vice President of RCS.\nMy reasons for standing, what I hoped to achieve, and my\neventual reasons for withdrawal were amply put in my\nhustings speech yesterday, but\nfor those either absent or asleep\nat the time I would like to\nreiterate them here.\nMuch has been written and\nsaid criticising the basic\nfacilities College provides for\nthe use of Imperial College\nstuden s. However, this\nsituation is unlikely to improve\nso long as College holds a monopoly on the provision of\nsuch services as refectories and\nbars. It must be the aim of any\ngood student union to work to\nprovide the students,that they\npurport to represent, with a viable and accountable\nalternative. In the past little has\nbeen done to promote either the\nfurtherance of student union\naccountability or the setting up\nof an alternative to the Mooney\nmonopoly.\nThe temptation for all union\nofficials has been to seek their\nanswers to burning questions\nthrough the College hack\nFriday, March 2, 19841\ni network, a network requiring acq ns cio us effort of opting in\nand hence a concept of\nexcluding the vast majority of\nstudents at Imperial. Little has\nbeen done to try to break out of\nthis restrictive circle. Few dep\nreps show any willingness to\nfully represent their respective\ndepartments on Union Council,\nand no Union officials appear\nto want to do anything to\nchange this, content to sit in\ntheir office avoiding the trouble\nof speaking to 'ordinary\nstudents'.\nIn previous years when faced\nwith the clearly unsatisfactory\nresults producing by the\n'Mooney monopoly' successive\nadministrations have either\nproposed refectory boycotts\nwhich never came to fruition or\nhave simply settle for\ncondemnation of Mooney\neither in FELIX or in\nconversation. Unsatisfactory\nthough the refectories are, they\ndo provide a convenient place\nto have a meal, and to many\npeople the convenience more\nthan compensates for the poor\nvalue and quality. It is surely\nnow time for the students' union to make a positive move\ntowards greater independance\nfrom College; it must look forward to providing and running\nits own independant refectory\nand bar system, providing what\nstudents want and making the\nresultant system accountable to\nthe students themselves.\nTo campaign for and implement such radical changes to\nthe conventional view of IC\nUnion demands a committed\nenthusiastic and determined\nDeputy President. While I am\nin little doubt about my enthusiasm and determination to\nwork towards the intro duct ion of such changes, Dave Parry's decision to stand for D.P. gave\nme second thoughts about\nstanding.\nIn retrospect I believe that\nDave Parry would probably\nmake the better Deputy\nPresident, his experience and\nability more than compensating\nfor my enthusiasm and\nidealism. If however anybody\nagrees with the points that I have outlined above, I urge you\nto fight to ensure that the\nexecutive takes them up next\nyear, and that they take\nImperial College Union\nforward to become a union\ntruly representing the interests\nof its students.\nYours sincerely\nSimon Neild\nI FELIX\n\n"

The real reason was that for the 36th year the Cross-Country Club were staging the\nHyde Park Relays. The semi-arctic conditions, with snow flurries, were only held at\nbay by the free Nike thermal T shirts given to\ncompetitors. After a mornings labour ing, at a time when most sensible students are still in\nbed, the Union Building and three-mile\ncourse around the Serpentine had been made\nready by club members, old boys and\nhangers-on.\nWhen the race started at 2:30pm it proved\nto hold no obstacles for the Loughborough\nteam who clocked another victory in 84min03 sec ahead of the w hinging Birmingham\nUniv squad who seemed to think that they\nwere the only team composed of bone-fide\nstudents, a fact which is undoubtedly true.\nThird place went to the West London\nInstitute of Higher Education. The\nLoughborough team lead the way among the\nafternoon's victors by not returning the\ntrophy they won last year\u2014rumour has it that\nit was melted down to buy matching\ntrack suits and 'wet-look' satin shorts. Fastest\n. lap went to Dave Clarke of W LI HE with a by Nigel Fenwick time of 13min19 sec. Clarke in his late\ntwenties and running for about the tenth time\nhas allegedly become a 'student' again after a few years on the staff team.\nThe ladies race was won by W LI HE, who\nalso didn't return the trophy they won last\nyear having pawned it to buy matching Nora\nBatty tights, in a new course record time of\n46min57 secs. It was thus surprising that the\nfastest lap went to Crewe & Alsager's Kay\nBarringham, who was neither man nor ex-student and so received the prize uncontested.\nHer team finished nearly 3mins behind\nW LI HE and in second place due to a very\nneat vanishing act performed by Kent ladies.\nIn amongst all this you may ask was there\nan IC team and where did it finish? The awful\ntruth is that they were roundly hammered by\nan aging old boys team more noted for their\nre cee ding hairlines, faded vests and alcoholic\ntremors than ay athletic ability. All the same\nthey finished in 34th place.\nNo report last week for those of you who\nwondered as not much happened. This week,\nhowever, a bumper edition.\nTeam 1 lost despite maintaining that they\nreally are trying to avoid relegation. They lost\nto Dept of Employment who in the last table\nwere bottom! Perhaps you should play with\nyour snooker cue Chris.\nTeam 3 played twice. Tuesday saw Exiles\ncome and go. We lost but successfully took\nthe piss after one piece of 'gamesmanship'\nwhen one of our team had fought back from\n3-12 down to 19-20. On making a noise on a net cord for deuce the opponent 'demanded' a let, whence the game was lost to us.\nSubsequently there was no initiative among\nus to play so we extracted the Michael.\nWednesday, however, saw a different team.\nWe all travelled to Barbican (long way for us)\nto play. City University and thanks to\nWladek playing like a hero (yet again) we\nwon!\nAll this dwindles into significance s, however, when reporting Team 4's game. In\nthe continuation of their remarkable recovery\nthey BEAT Lyndhurst III who are currently\nlying 4th in the division. Thanks to Mike\nSmith and especially to Brian Norminton\nwho won all his.\nTeam 5 have actually now submitted\nreports for their last three games which\nPage 12 IHM HH HH LM Hf fN ff iH apparently they won. Their most convincing\nmargin being 9-0 against LSE. I have been\nasked to say thanks to Phillip Milne for his\nMega style bat work in winning virtually\neverything and to give condolences to shiny\nHing Man who has been very unlucky\nrecently not to realise any results.\nNext week's report will contain the AGM election results, and if you missed the meeting\nTough!\nI couldn't think of anything to write about in\nthis report, until Pallab mentioned SEX. I thought that this was such a good idea to\nwrite about that now there will be no\nBadminton this Friday. Instead, at 7:30pm in\nSouthside, Chris Bean will give a talk on\n'other uses for badminton racquets'.\nMonday Badminton will take the form of a Roman style orgy in Southside for the rest of\nthis term. However, on all the other\nremaining Fridays, 'suppose we'd better play\nsome badminton and not start the 'beating'\nsessions until about 10:00pm. The last report of the term will hopefully\ncontain as many items of scandal as possible.\nAnyone who wants to embarrass other\nmembers of the club please contact me with\ndetails.

I just went on court and put in ten points in\na row and they never recovered. The rest of\nthe guys played reasonable defence\u2014we\nstopped the guy with the bun on his head\nfrom scoring as freely as in previous matches,\neven their 7'2\" guy couldn't save them.\nOffence the guys would give the ball so as I could pull some superb baseline drives etc.\nIf was a good match but I had it sown up\nthat I rest most of the first half!\nGotta go the freak show man.\nLove Robert.\n\n"

    "content": "Elections\nNext Monday and Tuesday elections will be held for the posts of President,\nDeputy President, Honorary Secretary and FELIX Editor. Next year's sabbatical officers will be representing student interests on College committees, manage\nthe clubs, societies and entertainment the Union provides. The FELIX Editor\nmust be able to campaign on relevant issues and keep you informed in a lively\nand entertaining manner. This weekend you are going to have to sift through the\nmass of election bump h thrust upon you and decide who the right people for the\nvarious jobs are.\nDetailed information about the candidates and their policies can be found in\ntheir manifestos in FELIX and their handouts. These should be taken with a pinch of salt. Candidates often exaggerate their qualifications and make\npromises they can't fulfill. You should weigh up their promises and consider\nwhether they are realistic. Some candidates visit the halls and houses canvassing\nfor votes. Although to some people this is very irritating it is an ideal\nopportunity to find out what sort of person they are and whether they can do the\njob if elected. The Hustings U GM is by far the best way of deciding who the best\npeople are. Despite nerves it's amazing how the true qualities of a candidate\nshine through, especially when they have to answer questions from the floor. If\nyou weren't there then ask a friend who was there about how each of the\ncandidates fared.\nThe temptation to assume that the Union will continue to run whichever\ncandidate is elected, is a strong one. However, a poor sabbatical can have a disastrous effect on the services the Union enjoy. When you vote make sure your\nvote next week is an informed one.\nAccommodation\nThe deadline for applications for College accommodation is 9 March, if you\nhaven't been to the Student Services Office to pick up the application forms then\ndo so today before it is too late. The accommodation guide on page 5 is designed\nto complement the fact sheet available from the Student Services Office. The fact\nsheet attempts to 'sell' these places to you, our accommodation guide presents,\nhopefully, more of a student's eye view of the options open to you. We have\nattempted to be as objective and accurate as possible. We hope it is useful. If you\nhave any comments about the guide or want to make any corrections please do\nsend them to me via the FELIX Office.\nUGC\nThe University Grants Committee has sent out a questionnaire to all universities\nasking them how higher education should be managed in fu g ture. The document\nitself is very wide ranging, investigating anything from the length of degree\ncourses to the balance between the numbers of arts and science students. Most\nimportantly, the questionnaire asks universities to estimate the effects of\ncutbacks in government funding. Professor Alan Swanson, Pro Rector, will be\nspeaking about Imperial College's reply to the questionnaire next Tuesday in\nMech Eng 220 at 1:00pm. Anyone concerned about the future of higher\neducation should be there.\nCredits\nMatt Fawcett, Pete Hobbis, Malcom Gray, Andy Gray, Tony Atkins, Diane Love,\nRich Archer, Jon Jones, Lynne James, Sean Davis, J Martin Taylor, Tim Noyce,\nPeter Rodgers, David Rowe and Maz.

It does not require any specialist\nknowledge of bridge to solve it. Forthose of you who\ndon't play bridge, all you need to know is that North\nand South play together against East and West; that\nyou must follow suit if possible; that a trump beats\nany non-trump, that each player lays one card in\neach trick; that the winner of one trick leads in the\nnext; that even though North and South play to-get her, if North wins the trick North leads in the next\ntrick, South cannot, and that North is dummy, so all\nhis cards are laid face up on the table for all to see.\nSouth plays all North's cards.\nThe problem is for North-South take all thirteen\ntricks with hearts as trumps. The king of clubs was\nled by West, and was beaten in South's hand by the\nace. How do North-South play out the remaining\ntricks, in such a way that they will succeed no matter\nhow the remaining cards are distributed.\nGood luck, everyone.\nNorth\nSouth\n10 9 8\nAK76547632A QA K Q JA2Q J1098 Solutions, comments, criticisms to me at the\nFELIX Office by 1:00pm on Wednesday, please. \u00a35\nfrom Mend-a Bike and a pack of cards from Omar\nfor the randomly selected winner.\nLast week's solution\nCombining statements (1), (2), (5) and (7), the\nscore lines are 1-0, 1-0, 1-1, 2-0, 2-1, 2-2. Knowing\nthat four of the matches were better teams from the\nsame area, then because Arsenal played Everton,\ntwo of the matches were Tottenham v Chelsea and\nLiverpool v Manchester United. From statement (6),\nTottenham beat Chelsea 2-0. Statement 9 may have\nconfused you if you misread it, as some people did.\nLosing 2-1 is not achieving the same result as\nwinning 2-1, so Newcastle won 2-1, Liverpool los tO1 and Arsenal drew 1-1. From (3) and (4) Sunderland\nbeat Wolves 1-0, so keeping the rule of four local\nmatches, Newcastle must have won 2-1 against\nMiddlesbrough, so Birmingham drew 2-2 with\nCoventry. Hence the solution reads\nTottenham 2 Chelsea 0\nNewcastle 2 Middlesbrough 1\nManchester United 1 Liverpool 0\nArsenal 1 Everton 1\nSunderland 1 Wolves 0\nBirmingham 2 Coventry 2\nAfter a few difficult puzzles, I thought it time for a fairly straightforward one. Accordingly there were\nthirty-eight correct solutions, and Alex Wilson of\nElec Eng 1 was the randomly selected winner. He\ncan collect his \u00a35 prize, courtesy of Mend-a Bike\nfrom the FELIX Office after 1:30pm on Monday.\nThanks, Sharpshooter.\nFFl IX is ou blis he db v the Editor for and on behalf of Imperial College Union Publications Board and is printed bythe UnioniPrinlUnit Prince Consort Rd^Sm\nTel 01 -589 51ll ext n1048 or internal 2881.

    "content": "Ladies Sport\nAt last the long awaited report. All this really\nhas to say is about the new exercise bicycle in\nthe multi gym in the sports centre. The bike\nhas been bought to en cou arge ladies to use\nthe multi gym, so do please give it a go. The\nonly catch is would all users of the bike enter\ntheir names in the book provided. This is so\nwe can tell whether the bike was worth the\nmoney or not. Your cooperation in this\nmatter would be appreciated.\nFinally if there's anything concerning\nladies sports, or even anything scandalous or\nlibelous that I might be vaguely interested in,\nlet me know.\nIC Ladies XV8 QM C Ladies XV4 To complete the full set of rugby features\nagainst QM C the ladies played on a cold but\ndry day at Harlington. There was much for\nthe few spectators, including ITV film crew,\nto cheer about as the game was played with all\nthe fer v our and commit t ment that befalls all\ngrudge matches against QM C. The forward\ngame was frequently scrappy, neither sides\nbeing able to gain control and tidy up the\nloose ball, too give the platform which was\nrequired. In the set pieces honours were fairly\nevenly shared. QM C dominating the line out and IC the scrum s, the latter often being\nproblematical due to the over keene s s of the\nIC front row to lower the service, leading to\nmany collapses. The both sets of\nthree quarters exhibited good positional\nsense, and some good straight running was\nseen. Hardee's disease was apparent with too\nmany passes being fumbled, though the\npassing was of good quality in the main. IC\nopened the scoring after about 10 minutes of\nthe first half through Vanessa Yates, the ball\nwas passed down the line to the wing; she then\nran past her opponents number and the full\nback to score from the half way line. In the\nprocess she left the referee struggling to keep\nup, and all were grateful for the delay caused\nby the IC kicker building a mound of not\ninsignificant proportions. With the conversion\nnarrowly being missed the game restarted\nwith QM C tightening up their game and\nincreasing their resolve. A period of sustained\npressure followed, with all the play in IC's half, however this was not converted with\nplants. In the second half QM C were starting\nto get on top and a firm handling move, the\nball again going down' the line to the wing\nresulted in a try. Perhaps the men's three quarters could learn something here.\nThe game then reverted to its previous\nscrappy opening, and it looked like a draw\nuntil th g' IC scrum half, Leah Wallbank,\nbroke form the base of the scrum, and in a \u00ab solo effort ran f he try in from forty yards,\nbarely out pacing the cover. The final score\nwas 8-4 in favour of IC. Today a report on\nLadies Rugby including excerpts of the match\nwill be shown on the 'Six O 'clock Show' on\nITV at, wait for it, six o 'clock.\nCastaways Cup\nIC 11st IC II equal 3rd This is the inter-London team-racing trophy\nand was competed for by six teams from\nLondon colleges and visiting teams from City\nUniversity and UEA. The teams were\norganised in to two leagues, with the top two\nof each league going through to semi-finals.\nIC I won all their races in their league. IC II\nhowever, managed to actually lose a race to\nQM C, but gained a place in the semi-finals as\nrunners-up in their league.\nThe semi-finals brought the two IC teams\ntogether on the Sunday. A great deal of\npsychological warfare was attempted before\nthe match with IC II trying to put good old j 'Skip' Jones (can't have a report without\nmentioning him!) off his stride by promising\nto sink him. His minder/crew, Kate BC however, countered this by threatening to hit\non the nose anyone who tried this!\nIn the first race the author's boat shot into\nthe lead with some expert role-tacking by his\ncrew, Richard Tostevin. However this was\nnot enough for IC II to win and IC I finished\nwith a winning 2, 3, 4 combination. The\nsecond race was yet another victory for IC I. The final was then IC I against QM C, who\nhad won the other semi. This was won by IC,\ntwo races to one. The defeat of last year, when\nQM C won the trophy in the event which is\ntraditionally won by IC, was therefore\navenged.\nIcarus\nOrienteering On Saturday the Orienteering Club entered a team in the Hyde Park Relay, striking fear\ninto the cross-country team as we used to beat\nthem in this race! However, with a big event\nthe following day a type of running\nunfamiliar to oriente ers, we were obliged to\nrelinquish an early lead and let them beat us\nthis year.\nThe main event of the weekend was the\nMidland Championships, a premier event\noffering demanding navigation and quality\nterrain. Simon 'Captain Coke' Errington\namazed us by finishing third in one of the top\nclasses, while Bruce Bricknell justified his\nseeding in the elite A class with a fine run. The\nothers had less amazing runs, but doubtless\nlearned much from the demanding courses.\n'Wally of the Week' award goes to me, for a new low in performance after the mega Hyde\nPark Relay piss-up on Saturday night!\nNow that the cross country season is over,\nmaybe some of their team may like to try\nsome really hard running: navigation over\nwild terrain at speed\u2014that's orienteering.\nPunchdrunk\nTwo uniformed f?) teams caused a sensation\nin the recent RCS six aside soccer competition\nby reaching the final in the face of strong\nopposition.\nIn a tense semi-final miniscule student\nhouse team, Rayleigh House Academicals,\ndefeated holders Mining House two-nil with\ngoals from Meeres and Bradley and a string of\nsaves from keeper Slater. In the other semifinal Neil's Neds, allegedly a team of\nundergraduate chemists, had an easy win\nover the rugged Purples.\nThe final was a closely fought affair with\nNeil's Neds opening their account with a fine\nshot on the turn from Van den Begin\nRayleigh equalise d with a neat header from\nReynolds only for Neil's Neds to clinch it in\nthe final minute.\nFELIXl\n\\Frlday, March 2, 1984\\\nDear Member or Potential Member\nA short note to keep you up to date with\nevents so far.\nAbout two weeks ago we became an official\nclub within the Imperial College Union. Last\nweek was the first week of 'real action'. Like\nmost weeks it started on a Monday, though I suppose that depends on your particular view\nof the world. Nevertheless this particular\nMonday we had a meeting at lunchtime, and\nelected a committee to run the club. A list\nwent around the nine brave souls volunteered,\nfor a skiing trip on Wednesday.\nOn Tuesday the committee met. Basically\nall that was discussed was how to get some\nmoney from the Union and how, once it was\nacquired, to spend it best. We agreed that the\npriority should be to sub sid is e the cost of\nbeing towed, as we felt that with a bit of good\nwill and tolerance, we could manage being a few wetsuits short. Apparently the sailboard\npeople manage with about three between\neighty of them The question of the\n'edge bar' came up, and the chairman looks'\nlike having a busy weekend* botching one up!\nOnce fitted it should be a great help to those\n(principally me, it seems) who* aren't already\nproficient.\nWednesday was very windy, even so all\nseven that actually came had a tow. The wind\nmeant that spray was a problem, and the only\nreal cold bits were exposed hands and feet.\nThere may be a case for getting some gloves\nand socks. That said, we still survived pretty\nwell, and I for one am looking forward to\nmore afternoons in the docks, especially as\nthe weather improves.\nThe good news saved until last; simply that\nif all goes to plan, skiing will be sub sidi sed down to \u00a32.90 as opposed to the present \u00a34 a shot. It's not final yet. (We're still working on\nit)...so keep your fingers crossed!\nAll the best until Monday, i Trevor\n1\n(Secretary)\nmm UW k^k^k^ MUWUWMWMUUUM\\ P^ ge\n\n"

    "content": "Same Old Story\nU GM Sketch\nThe excessive number of candidates for sabbatical posts\nhas gradually been whittled down\nthis week but that didn't prevent\nyesterday's hustings reaching\nepic proportions. The meeting's length was matched only by its\nboredom and necessitates the\nawarding of the second annual\nAgatha Christie This Meeting\nWill Run and Run Award to\nChairman Passmore who unfortunately asked seven or\neight questions to each of the\ncandidates when lesser men\nwould have settled for one. The\nsituation was much exacerbated\nby Hon Sec Se^n Davis' burning\ndesire to disqualify a candidate\nwhich he succeeded in doing\nwhen the meeting upheld the\ndecision of both Executive and\nElections Committee in disqualifying Mark Cottle,\npreviously a candidate for\nFELIX Editor. Indeed it seemed\nto take longer to disqualify a candidate from an election than it\ndid to actually hear them speak.\nThis took about thirty minutes\nand then the meeting quickly\nmoved through minutes and\nofficers reports\u2014not even\nstopping to point out that the\nmuch feared Managing Surveyor\n(Residences) has already been\nappointed\u2014the aptly named Mr P Hallworth will take up his\nappointment on MayDay. They're a witty lot over in\nSherfield.\nOnly five of the six Presidential\ncandidates turned up on time and\nbroadly seemed to present the\nsame policy\u2014a reduction in rape\nalarm prices bought from the bar\nat Harlington during rent\nstrikes\u2014or something equally\nridiculous.

Mr Neild's decision means that Dave Parry, presently RCS Vice President, is elected\nunopposed as DP. Also at the meeting an appeal against disqualification\nby Mark Cottle, who was standing for FELIX Editor, was quashed by 197\nvotes to 143 on a paper ballot. Mr Cottle was disqualified because a manifesto which was considered to be in support of his campaign\nappeared in Guildsheet, a direct contravention of the election rules.\nThe meeting started with Mr noises to punctuate his\nCottle's appeal. Jim Boucher of\nthe Elections Committee explained the decision and Mr Cottle spoke in reply. The ballot\nwas counted during the following\nofficers' reports and was announced before the hustings\nbegan.\nAfter the reports the meeting\nheard speeches from five of the\nsix candidates for President. Jon\nBarnett was not present, but a speech was made by his proposer\nJon Taylor who urged candidates\nto vote for Mr Barnett or abstain.\nIan Bull spoke of his experience\nand proven ability to be President, whilst Gareth Fish made an\noutspoken attack on College, the\nUnion and bar prices, sentiments\nwhich were echoed by David\nLarrington. Aidon Jennery made\nproposer's speech, and Paul\nSimion promised to get tough\nwith College over important\nissues.\nThe DP hustings took place\nnext. Srmon Neild spoke first,\nand at the end of his speech he\ndropped his bombshell and\nannounced he was withdrawing.\nMr Neild said that there were\nmany things he would like to see\ndone to improve the Union, and\nthat in talking to his opponent he\nhad found they had a broad area\nof agreement on this. He was\nstanding down because he felt\nthat Mr Parry' s greater\nexperience would enable him to\nbe a better DP. Dave Parry then made his\nspeech despite being now\nunopposed. This was followed by\nthe Hon Sec candidates. Eric\nDerbyshire spoke first, again\nstressing his experience for the\npost. Ian House spoke of the need\nfor the Union to support direct\nstudent action much more.\nThe FELIX Editor candidates\nmade speeches last. Adrian\nJames attacked this year's FELIX as being a poor copy of\nPrivate Eye and Tim Noyce\nthought FELIX needed to be\nbigger and to cater for more\ntastes. Peter Rodgers committed\nhimself to improving the written\ncontent of the paper, whilst Dave\nRowe promised to brighten up\nthe appearance of FELIX which\nhad stayed much the same for\nfour years.\nThe remaining chance to hear\nthe candidates in action if you\nmissed the Hustings U GM is on\nIC Radio on Friday evening.\nVoting is next Monday and\nTuesday at ballot boxes in all\ndepartments. You will need your\nUnioncard to vote.\nBINGO!\nIt seemed like an ordinary day for Peter Gwee of Physics\n1\u2014until he saw last week's FELIX Bingo number that is!\nLucky Peter could hardly contain himself w fieri he found\nout that he had won the weekend for two in Amsterdam.\nAs yet Peter hasn't decided who to take with him hence\nthe presence of top Union freebie hunters, Teller and\nDavis attempting to muscle in on the act at the present a Aidon Jennery and his proposer, La la trou bringing the House ifl tion ceremony-Pictured above Peter Gwee receiving\ndown with their entertaining speech.

Joint collections had to be organised because\nIC Rag had left it too late to apply\nfor their o wi. collection licenses.\nThere will also be a Hypnosis\nLecture and Demonstration by\nMartin S Taylor on Tuesday at\n7:00pm in ME220. For this there\nwill be a \u00a32 entrance charge, with\nproceeds to Rag. And on Tuesday lunchtime there will be Silly\nGames in the JCR. See your C CU for further details. However, a word of warning\u2014it is rumoured\nthat Guilds Custare Pie Brigade\nwill be active during the week.\nMore\nFascist\nTory Cuts\nThe College is to receive \u00a328.08m from the University Grants Committee as its recurrent grant for\n1984/5 it was announced\nrecently. This compares with\n\u00a327.29m for this year and represents a2'/2% cut in real terms.\nThe effect on College spending\nin areas other than salaries is\nlikely to be greater than a2'/2% cut, however. A senior academic\nin College has estimated the\nresult will be a10% cut in\nexpenditure on teaching.\nThe College is presently formulating all its response to the\nUGC's questionnaire on the\nfuture of higher education. A draft reply was considered at a Board of Studies meeting on\nWednesday and was approved\nwith minor alterations. It will\nnow be considered by the Governors at their meeting on 16\nMarch. Professor Swanson, ProRector, who is co-ordinating the\nresponse will be speaking about\nthe College's reply next Tuesday\nat 1:00pm in ME220. FELIX will\nbe bringing you more details of\nthe College's reply in a forthcoming issue.\nFELIX ^Kumukwnmm\nNot in Public Sean!\nNext year's RCS Exec can't wait to get started! They\nwere ratified at the Results UGM last Tuesday and\nthey're just raring to go. Ann Collins was elected RCS\nPresident with a majority of 256 votes and Sean Davis\nwas elected Vice President with a majority of 114 votes.\nPaul Bloomfield (Hon Sec), Jane Ryder (AAO) and Paul\nRichardson (HJT) were unopposed.\nLaundry behind Schedule\nThe Southside Central Launderette will not be completed by the scheduled date, next\nMonday. Don Clark, Estates\nSecretary, said that the work was\n'3 to 4 weeks' behind, and the\nlaunder et te will not now open\nuntil next term. The new gym in\nSouthside will also not be ready\nuntil next term.\nThe management of the launder et te will be undertaken by the\nnew Managing Surveyor (Resi-den ces), and the finances of the\nservice will be under the Residence Account. The charges for\nwashing and drying have not yet\nbeen fixed, but they will take into\naccount the cost of providing the\nfacilities and for depreciation of\nequipment.\nMews\nNUS Debate\nThe motion 'This house believes\nthat ICU does not need the NUS' I was narrowly carried on Tuesday\nat a meeting jointly organised by\nthe Conservative and Liberal\nsocieties.\nProposing the motion, Federation of Conservative Students\ni Vice-Chairman, Marc Glenden! ning spoke of his main objection\n! to the NUS, that many students\nwere forced against their wishes\nto become members of an organisation with whose policies they\ndid not agree. NUS Secretary\nJane Taylor opposing said that\nall students could vote to determine whether their student union\nwas in the NUS. She claimed the\nNUS was an effective voice\nrepresenting students.\nSeconding the motion J Martin\nTaylor, former ICU External\nAffairs Officer, spoke of the\nexpense of NUS membership,\nwhich would cost ICU over\n\u00a3 15,000. He said this would result\nin severe cuts in Union spending\non student activities. Seconding\nthe opposition Philip Nathan (ex-IC Liberal Club chairman)\nclaimed that NUS's work resulted in large benefits to individual students and student unions\nwhich far outweighed the cost of\nmembership.\nAfter speeches from the floor\nthe proposer s made summing-up\nspeeches and on the vote the\nmotion was carried by a one-vote\nmargin.\nSouthside Halls to close?\nThe consequences of the recent\ninspection of the Southside Halls\nby GLC Fire Inspectors could be\nfar more serious than previously\nreported. The College is to\nreceive a report from the inspectors in about eight weeks time\nwhich it is expected will call for a major re-appraisal of fire precautions in the halls and may\ninclude structural changes.\nThe inspectors are understood\nto be worried by the staircase\nlayout of the halls since fire could\nquickly spread up the stair-wells.\nThe layout of the gallery levels is\nalso a cause for concern and may\nhave to be altered by the\ninstallation of extra partitions to\nact as fire screens.\nMr Don Clarke, College\nEstates Secretary, would not\ncomment on the likely findings of\nthe report, saying he would wait\nuntil the report was delivered to\nCollege before making any state-ment. He said that the inspectors\nhad asked at the time of their visit\nfor certain action to be taken\nimmediately, including the removal of fridges, dustbins and\nbicycles from the staircases. It is\nthought they also made clear\ntheir concern over the structural\nlayout of the building, but the\nCollege is not required to take\naction until the report is com-ple te. The inspection was originally\nrequested by the College in view\nof the increased use of the halls as\na hotel in summer. It is difficult to\nsee what steps could be taken to\nalter the basic structure of the\nhalls, but it seems likely that the\nCollege will at least be required to\nbreak each stair-well up into\nsmall units by the installation of\nfire doors and screens to prevent\nfire spreading. Another possibility would be the installation of\nmore sophisticated fire detection\nand control equipment. Whatever steps are taken considerable\nexpense would be involved,\nwhich raises the question of how\nthe College would pay for the\nextra precautions.\nMeanwhile on most hall landings the fridges have been moved\nto on of the side lobbies after the\ninspectors' visit. However this is\nonly seen as a temporary so lu tion, since it is thought unlikely\nsuch a move would satisfy the\ninspectors. A permanent solution\nhas still to be formed.\nI Friday, March 2, 1984* \\Page3\n\n"

John Peel has gone for\nthe odd tipple of Serious Drinking on\nseveral occasions, but otherwise they\nremain one of the more popular of the\nlesser known bands.\nAt the Hammersmith Palais last\nDecember they had already downed six\nor seven pints but still managed to amble\non stage with all the ceremony of guests\nlining up for a wedding photograph.\nSerious Drinking have been described\nas 'a proper punk band forthe 80s'; ie not\na band decked out in studs and leather,\nbut still with (light hearted) anarchistic\nideas. Their 13-track LP is called The\nRevolution Starts at Closing Time and\nincludes such punk y classics as TV Song\nand 12XU/ Bobby Moore is Innocent. Also\non the album is a mixed bag of songs\nabout football and Sgt Ernie Bilko who is\nalso (quite-rightly) featured on the label\nand sleeve. A lot of the second side\nresembles early Madness/Specials so if\nyou've had several drinks you might find\nyourself bopping along to such goodies\nas Baby I'm Dying a Death.

Serious\nDrinking aren't to be taken too seriously,\nbut it might be an idea to get to the bar in\nadvance tonight.\nJulian Reynolds\nFAMILY ENTERTAINMENTnALL NIGHTLONG\nALL'S WELLE WITH\nNEW MODEL ARMY\nFriday's Carnival is a rare opportunity to catch New Model Army in a London\nappearance. The band play rock music, in the broadest sense of the word, with a cathartic edge of commitment reminiscent of The Alarm but their appeal stems\nfrom strong songs with incisive lyrics rather than two foot high hair-dos. In fact,\nas they say in journalese, the band have an image problem which to you and I means that the lead singer is an ugly bastard. Although he is short of teeth, that\nis certainly not true of the music.\nMany of NMA's lyrics deal with life in their home town of Bradford; songs of a dead-end city absorbed in its own self-perpetuating rituals. Fellow locals JB Priestley and Keith Waterhouse wrote of warmth and intimacy but NMA confront\nlethargy, frustrated dreams and Tetley Bittermen.\nDon't get the impression that NMA wallow in misery\u2014they are a tonic,\nsomething that won't go amiss at IC with its own brand of apathy to contend\nwith.\nJ M Cottom\nMARCHING ON!\nTHE ORSONS\nFor those who like to categorise music the Orson Family\noffer quite a few choices. They've been termed rockabilly,\npunk a billy. psychobilly and now lately cramp a billy. This is\nfurther evidence of the shift towards old, traditional values\nand away from the despair of a few years ago when\neverything was suffixed with ism\u2014rock is m, minimalism and\nso on. The Orson Family aren't alone in this rediscovery of\npre-rock'n 'roll styles\u2014two bands who played college last\nterm, the Chevalier Brothers and Helen and the Horns, are\ndoing well with their furious jump-jive and melodic country\nand western respectively\u2014but the Orsons are certainly well\nahead of the field having released a six-track mini-LP The\nRiver of Desire (new Rose).\nMost songs feature the chunky, abrasive guitars of Ruby\nand Vernon over the backing beat supplied by Brewster\nwhich is precise on the title track, pummelling on Monster of\nBriarly Wood and ever-so-slightly derivative of the shifting\nrhythms of the Ruts' Babylon Burning on Breakout. All of\nthis is overlaid by manic singer Skully who frequently sounds\nlike the highly eccentric Captain Beefheart but shows his\nrange on the plaintive Ball and Chain and Buddy Hollyisms\non the quirky Heartbeat.\nThe NME liked them live last week, I like their record this week\nand you should like them tonight.\nPeter Rodgers\nCOOK DA BOOKS - HOT OFF THE PRESSES\nCook da Books have come a long way in\ngeographical if not musical terms since\ntheir formation as the not quite so snappy\nCook the Books in Liverpool's Fazackerly\ndistrict about three years ago.\nTheir debut single\u2014 Piggie in the\nMiddle Eight-was a catchy reggae-dub\ncrossover produced by Dennis Bovell\nand reminiscent of the Police with\nwonderfully resonant bass and coarse\nStingy vocal The B side was a medley of\nwell-known television theme tunes\n(including The Sweeney and Hawaii FiveO) played in the same dub style.\nNeither this nor follow-ups Low Profile\nand / Wouldn't Want to Knock /^'achieved\nany chart success although the latter\nmarked a distinct change in direction.\nPage 8 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nThe reggae influences were abandoned\nand the bass which previously defined\nthe distinctive shape of the melody was\nreplaced with a leaden thud which totally\nundermined their move to what may well\nhave been some very fine fleet-footed\nelectro-pop.\nHowever by now these were only minor\nirritations as by a stroke of luck the band\nhad become big in France\u2014courtesy of\nthe single Your Eyes taken from a film\nsoundtrack. The single charted all over\nEurope and even resulted in an\nappearance on one of the Top of the Pops\noccasional Eurochart rundowns.\nWhilst this was happening they were\nalso given the support slot on what was to\nbe the last Undertones tour. Unfortunately they seem to have learned little\nfrom the masters as their soon-to-be-released single Caress Me on Virgin\nsub sid ary10, marks the final stage in the\ntransition from a quirky independent\nband to conformist corporation chart-fodder via lavish production, female\nbacking singers, lyrics like you're\nnothing more than a viper' (shades of\nragged tigers?) and endless refrains of\n'yea a h,ye a ah wo wow o'. Unfortunately\nthis seems to be what the people want:\nLive however they may be a different\nproposition as they are still hip enough to\ndo John Peel sessions.\nPeter Rodgers\nTonight's Carnival marks a speedy\nreturn to IC for Yorkshire-based\ngoth/punk outfit the Skeletal Family.\nTheir Lounge Lizards gig of a month\nago was enthusiastically received (by\nme) and they definitely warrant arriving\non time to see.

    "content": "Feature\nTHE PIMLICO CONNECTION The Pimlico Connection started eight years ago, when twelve electrical\nengineering students began 'tutoring' at nearby Pimlico Comprehensive\n(hence the name of the society). Since then the project has steadily\ndeveloped until now around eighty students are involved each year, tutoring six local schools. Outside recognition of 'Pimlico's' educational value\nhas come from the Royal Society of Arts, with an Education for Capability\naward last year.\nTutoring\nTutoring involves students working with\nsmall groups of schoolchildren within normal\nclasses, usually during practical lessons. The\naim is to give the pupils more help and attention than a teacher alone could provide. Because students are often closer to the pupils\nin both age ard attitude than the teacher, the\nkids find it easier to ask questions and seek\nhelp. Tutoring is not at all like formal\nteaching\u2014the atmosphere is usually friendly,\nwith the tutors in a role similar to that of postgraduates helping out in practicals here at\n\u00a3 ^plm peri al. The teachers still retain overall res-wp on sibi lit y and co-ordinate and supervise the\nlessons.\nWhy do people do it?\nSome students are interested in becoming\nteachers, and so try tutoring to decide if\nteaching is likely to be right for them. Others\nhave no intention to become teachers, but\n- . . . try tutoring because they think it will be fun. It\nusually is, because the work is not taxing, the\nkids are enjoyable to be with and tutoring\nmakes a pleasant change from the abstraction and day-to-day slog of university life.\nMany students find that tutoring is of value\nacademically because it gives practice in\ncommunicating scientific ideas simply and\neffectively. People on the scheme often say\nthat it helps them realise that one of the major\nproblems J or scientists is their inability to' communicate properly with people outside\ntheir particular discipline.\nWhat involved?\nTutoring is usually for a couple of hours on\nWednesday afternoons from October to mid-February. Most of the kids are first and\nsecond years at the four comprehensives,\nbecause they are at the age when interest in\nscience, especially amongst girls, needs most\nencouragement. Older age groups are also\ntutored, up to an Electronics Workshop for\nSixth Formers. The youngest pupils are\nthose aged 10/11 in their final year at the two\nprimary schools. Fox and St Clement and St\nJames'. Thus tutors can have some choice\nover the sort of age-group they would like to\ntutor.\nThe same choice applies to the subjects\ntutored. General Science and Maths are the\nmost common, at all age groups. Students\nwith workshop experience help out with\nmetalwork, woodwork and engineering\ndrawing. The work isn't difficult\u2014the main\nthing is to sort out problems and get across\nideas in a simple and easily understood way.\nAll tutors stay with the same class\nthroughout the tutoring period, so you get to\nknow the kids well. The idea of teaching\nhordes of unruly thirteen-year-olds seems to\nput many people off. But tutoring isn't like\nteaching at all. You work with small groups,\nand once the kids realise you're not a despised 'teacher', they become friendly and\nenthusiastic. In fact they're often far more\ninterested in you than the work, so you're\ncontinually being asked about your private\nlife: 'Have you got a boy/girl-friend?', 'How's your sex life?' and so on. It's hopeless to\nparry this sort of question with 'Oh, look at\nthis equation\u2014isn't the proof interesting!' All\none can do is ask them how their sex life is\ngoing, which embarrasses them in turn.\nA Typical Lesson\nA tutor wrote the following account of a typical lesson for this article.\n'I 've been tutoring 10/11 year olds at Fox\nPrimary this year. The mixed-ability group I work with each week consists of four girls\nand two boys.\n'Imagine you're running along carrying a ball and you drop it as you cross a line on the\nplayground. WiD the ball land on the line, in\nfront of it or behind it?'\nThe boys tend to say the first thing that\noccurs to them, and get it wrong. They,\nhowever, learn quickly as they try it out. The\nli r je ii end to think harder and their initial\nanswers are often right, but they are\nreluctant to speak up or show it in practice\nfor fear of being wrong. One girl, Trixie, said\n'It will land on the line, because when you\ndrop something, it goes straight down. Like\nwe showed last week.' Another girl, Emily\nbelieved 'The ball will land in front of the line\nwhen you drop it, it sort oL.carY ies on.'\nEveryone writes down what they think will\nhappen. We then troop out to test it in\npractice. The kids work in twos\u2014one\nrunning at different speeds and with different objects to drop, another taking measurements and writing them down as they occur\nWhen enough people have fallen over and\nhurt themselves and enough results tables\nhave blown away in'the wind, we all go back\nindoors to write the lesson up and discuss the\nresults. Hopefully conservation of momentum will have been shown, if not proved. The\nscience is at a simple level, but as it's so basic\nit's important the kids understand it properly,\nor at least have a qualitative feel for the ideas\ninvolved.' _ . . . .\nTony At/cms\nIn Tuesday 6 March there will be a Recruiting Lunch from 12:30 in Elec\nEng 606. This will give anyone who is interested a chance to meet students\nwho have tutored this year, and receive more information about how the\nscheme is run.\n! If you are interested in 'Pimlico' but unable to come to the introductory\nmeeting, please just contact Dr J SR Goodlad, Elec Eng 501 (int 3080) or\nZygmund Lozinski, DoC3. \u2022\n/\ni* Wr\n0 5 ? -FELIX \\ 1Friday, March 2, 19841 Page 7\n\n"
