    "content": "PROFILE\nD. HUGHES\nF, EI..IX\nThis year as secretary of the University Rugby\nClub and vice president of the R.S. M. Derek Hughes is co ning to the end of a most colourful university life. Derek comes from Lytham near Blackpool and was\neducated at King Edward VII School where he distinguished\nhimself both in the scrum and in the 3wim ming bath. The\nAdmiralty then entertained hi r ru for the next three .years\nwhere he spent most of his time flaying, rugby aS fe: gramophone records. He came to I.C. in1949 in the inter\nyear with the idea of taking up physics.but at the end of\ntwo years he reconsidered his ideas. The R.C.S.' s loss ^\nwas the R. S.M.'s gain, for he decided that he. was more\nsuited to the hurl y burly life of a mining engineer than\nthat of a physicist, needless to say a decision about\nwhich he has no regrets. His interest in the pure\nsciences is by no means dead; indeed his enthusiasm for assaying is remarkable. Nowadays a wealth of other\nactivities have forced him to choose the lectures he\nattends with care, but when he is present he is so\nengrossed that he is seldom seen to stir for the space of\nan hour.\nHis main interest at college is still rugby, in his first year at I.C. he played for the U.L.1 st XV; the\nfollowing year he was dropped but now he is back playing\nfor his third year in the University side. His popularity is always high on a rug ger tour for during his stay at college he has acquired an unlimited rep e to ire of songs and Jokes.\nThree years of hostel life left him with a reputation\nat carnivals of always being able to produce a really stimulating cocktail for his friends, although he prefers\na pint of bitter. At I.C. he is a member of Council\nand has sat on many committees. He has also helped run\nthe sail iry, film and jazz clubs.\nDuring the last few years he has turned his hand to a \u2022variety of other jobs. As a painter, bath attendant,\ncellar man and of course miner he has shown versatility, le has travelled over much of Iranc*, Holland and Sweden\nand incidents during his visit to Norway made headlines\nin the Daily Telegraph. His recent visit to Canada and\nthe States this summer caused a number of Canadians to\nreview their ideas of the British. He has decided views\non religion and is not at all hesitant in airing them in any company. His taste in music is rather wider than most\nhe collects records of serious music and also enjoys jazz.\nWhen asked for any further tastes, he declined, finding hims elf rather embarrassed by the whole affair. Among his present ambitions are to sail round the\nworld, play golf and breed dogs. We shall watch his future with interest.\nA New Low\nAvon engines . . . are more than 20 per cent, less\nthan other types of engines of slightly lower power.\nSunday Times, Nov: 22\nAero.

CHOIR CONCERT4 THE JACQUES ORCHESTRA CONDUCTED BY\nDR. E.H. BROWN\nTickets2/63/6 B3R Tliis review was written for the last Felix, but\nwas not printed because of space shortage. As it was\ncomposed in the Exhibition, under the influence and\nimpact of the paintings, it has been decided not to\nalter it by removing passages now out of date.\nI imagine that the first reaction of most people,\nseeing the appeals for paintings by members of the college\nfor an exhibition, was to suppose that the -whole thing\nwould be a complete flop. That was^how I felt, but I am\nhappy to be able to write that a preview of the exhibition 'lias converted me to such an extent that I shall rush\nto the shop tomorrow and buy a palette.-One hears a lot about the recreational properties\nof painting, and how Churchill and many other celebrities\n\u2022turn to it. The same effect is found in Imperial\nCollege, for this exhibition includes work by the Rector,\nhj j Mr. McDowall (General Studies Organiser), Mr. Tombs\n(who works very liard to make the Musical Society a success), and several professors.\nThe pictures are in the I. C.W. A. lounge and Committee\nRoom B, and one feels that a little more space would do\nthem no harm. Most of the works shown could have been\nexecuted before 1900, but a few, notably by Rex Dadd, are\nmuch more daring. Dr. H. Vfilman of Chem. Tech. has\nproduced some fine studies of flowers and C.C. Mills... shows a good etching\" of-Bruges, but if I was to award\np rises I should give them to exhibits 18, 39 and 41.\nThe standard of the wo asks is variable, and one feels\nthat composition does not\nreceive the consideration\nit deserves. The artist,\nunlike the camera, can be\nselective in his choice\nof subject and can form\nhis work into a united\nwhole, replacing in harm JL on io us details by others.\nIFW This is missing by many\n' q j f of the works in the\n\u2022 exhibition.\nIn conclusion, this exhi/bition which closes Jroday,\n,.m' should not be missed by any-jj * one in I.C. It is a brilliant v india ation of- those who\n\" claim that we b w \u2022\n=\n*\n-'\n.\n\u00ab\n\"\n>\n' claim that we belong to some-* thing more than a technical\ncollege.

    "content": "FELIX\nMORPHY-DAY\nMorphy Day, under pleasant conditions of as light following wind, and caj m water, saw Guilds retain the\nKorphy Cup and the R.C.S. gain their first success in the Lowry Cup since 1948. The racing was good and\nkeen and the standard of oarsman ship augers well for some really good I. C.r a wing in the coming year.\nThe marshalling and start of the Morphy Cup was an\nobject lesson in the starter's art and all three crews\ngot away well, C. AKG. in centre station striking54 in the first minute to the R.C.S. on Middx. 55 with R.S. M. on Surrey a point or two lower. C.&C. took as light lead at once with R.S. M. taking advantage of their posit ion in the faster water to lead R.C.S. At Harrods, C.&G.( striking30) were \\ length ahead of R.S. M.( striking28) with R.C.S.( at 31) z length behind. At this point R.C.S. began to pull up, and at the Crabtree C.&G. led by \u00a3\nlength from R.C.S. with R. S.M.a \u00a3 length behind. C.&G. as befitted their experience well coupled up throughout\nthe stroke, but looking somewhat ponderous about their blade entry were indistinct contrast to R.C.S. whose\n\" life\" on the beginning enabled them to maintain a higher\nrate of striking and race hard and this covered up deficiencies in time and timing. R.S. M. with two novice\noarsmen in the boat very wisely allowed themselves to row\nat their optimum rating and so get the best out of each\nman. By the mile C.&G. were clear of the other two\ncrews but along the wall R.C.S. began to go up and were\noverlapping the leaders by the Boathouses. Prom here to the finish C.&G. replied to the challenge and won a very\ngood race by l \u00a3 lengths from R.C.S., with R. S.M.a further\nlj lengths away, i a the good time of 7 mins. 44 sees.\nThe Lowry Cup proved to be a win for a hard working\nR.C.S. crew who had plenty of life on the beginning and\nkept their blades well covered throughout the stroke.\nStriking9,17,25 and 33 in the first quarter, half, three-quarter and full minute they were clear of the other two\ncrews at the end of the first minute and went on to win by\n2g lengths from C.&G. with R. S.M.a further 4 lengths\naway in4 mins. 22 sees. A very good time under the con-ditions.\nMalcolm Campbell the R.C.S. non-rowing Captain is to be congratulated on producing and coaching two good boats,\nand the two newcomers to the river in the R.S. M. boat deserve\nhigh praise for racing so well six weeks after the start\nof their rowing careers.\nThe starter was C.A. Bristow and the umpire R.C. Morris.\nMORPHY CREWS\nR.C.S.( Middx)\nBow ii.B.

Bentley A.K.G ill Fencing Those of I.C. who peer into the gym on Monday or\nThursday evenings are usually either shocked or enthralled\nby the display of energy and skill which is sometimes\nbeing demonstrated. The complexity of fencing is bewildering to the novice, and even more so to the\nPresident who interprets \"beat out\" for \"parry-riposte\".\nDespite these difficulties, I.C. has fenced reasonably successfully this term. Our first match against\nSalle Paul, with two-thirds an Olympic team, was lost\n15-5. The next two matches, versus King's and Poly were\nalso lost, both by 16-11; mainly due to the poor standard\nof the e pee fencing. In the latest match, against tJ.C, we lost the foil and e pee both 4-5, but by dint of some\nhard sabre play won that weapon 7-2, and so won the match\n15-12.\nSwimming_ \u201e . \u201e . .\n* I.C.S wi milling Club After a doubtful start, we are now settling down and looking forward to a sue ees s ful season.; as usual our first fixture was with U.C., the present holders of the U.L. Championship, who beatus quite soundly in the swimming and by a closer margin it water polo. Shortly after this however, we defeated N.B.C. at swimming and polo on two separate ooo as ions without much difficulty, and at an enjoyable match last Thursday we also defeated Q. JI.C. We have welcomed several fresher s this year, who have strengthened our ranks considerably, three of them now swimming for the first team, last week we had an extremely pleasant surprise when we met a gentleman looking at our noticeboard, he turned out to be last year's U.L. Swimming Club President, a swimmer of great repute, and the like of whom I. C.S.C. has not seen for many years. His presence in the Club is going to make no little difference, and we are very glad to have him with us. Results;,. \u201e .\nvs. Swimming\nU.C. U.C. Lost2411 NVE.C. Won 2 8 - 1 1\nN.E.C.

F.C. played against\nAachen University at Motspur Park, The weather was\ntypical of a foreigner's conception of the English\nclimate, cold and damp, with the now inevitable traces\nof smog. However, these phenomena in no way affected\nthe German' play and they won by four goals to one.\nPlay began at an extremely fast pace and but for\nsome atrocious marksmanship the I.C. team would have\nhad a comfortable lead after the first fifteen minutes.\nAfter this period Aachen settled down and began to play\nsoccer peculiar to the Continent, keeping the ball cm\nthe ground and moving it quickly from man to man without\nattempting to dribble. On occasions these tactics\nsplit the I.C. defence wide open and Aachen built up a two goal lead by half-time. The first half had\nproduced some first class football with the German team\ngradually gaining the ascendancy.\nIn the second half the I.C. team attacked vigorously but could make no impression on a defence which\ncleared its lines in the most acrobatic fashions. It\nappeared that the German centre half had modelled his\nstyle of play on that of Parola, the Italian player\nfamous for his overhead kicks. I.C. did manage to get\na consolation goal but if there had been a forward\ncapable of scoring goals it might have been a different\nstory.\nA Dinner was given in the Union after the match,\nwhere it was learned that Aachen were the present\nEuropean Universities Champions and that most of their\nplayers were semiprofessionals with German clubs. On\ntheir tour they had beaten Birmingham University 2-1\nand drawn with Loughborough 2\n-2\n_\nThe Germans presented the I.C. club with a pennant,\nwhich now adorns one of the trophy cases, as a remember-ance of their visit and as a token of their appreciation\nfor the enjoyable time they had at I.C. Hockey were beaten in \u2022\nAlthough unexpected, On the11 th of November I the1 st. Round by3 at terse a. Battersea must be given due praise for the irwin. They played good fast Hockey and fully deserved to win. The I.C. Team, strengthened by four U.L. players, took some time to settle down, particularly_ the defence, who were completely at a loss when Battersea swept through them to score twice in the first three minutes. After this initial shock, I.C. gradually settled down, and changed\nover only one goal down. By now the play was\nfairly even with I.C. perhaps doing a little more of the attacking. The forwards, however,\ntended to be a little slow against a hard tackling defence. Battersea scored again, but I.C. quickly' got two more and in the last few minutes almost scored again. The final whistle went with\nthe score three all. Extra time was played and Battersea scored twice more to win53. In other fixtures the1 st. Team., has had a very successful season so far. The 2nd. seem\" to be hitting winning form also. The3 rd. had their first win last Saturday, when all three teams won.\ngoals:?. w.D.L.\"51 D.1st.961222112 nd.620415i203 rd.5104823 Published by the FELIX Board\", Lmpcrki CoIJcge Uaioa, London.

It is rather less noisy and blatant than its predecessor 'South\nPacific' there is nothing equivalent to the\ngasps of interest at the antics of Bloody Mary.\nBut it is, unfortunately, somewhat less virile. Set in the palace of the King of Siam,\nthe story, which is based on the life of Anna\nLeonowens, demonstrates the effect of introducing an English schoolmistress into the Court. Anna\nis effectively played (and, surprisingly enough,\nsung) by Valerie Hobson, who moves charmingly\nthroughout. Roy Grant, as her son, has a voice\nnot full enough for the part, especially when\ncontrasted with the bold singing of Timothy\nBrooking playing the Heir Apparent. Herbert Lorn\nplays the King, to whom everything Western is. scientific, and who wants to be, but not be known\nas, a barbarian. His efforts at Western formal it., are amusing (or pitiful, depending on your out-look): and his chant \"A Puzzlement\" a pleasant\nspeculation on the mysteries of ethics, power,\n\"at cetera, et cetera\". Muriel Smith, as his chief wife, is as fine as ever, and her song\n\"Something Wonderful\" produced a great deal of\napplause.\nThe ballet within the play was an American\nconception of the manner in which the Orient\ninterprets Western tradition. Delightfully called \"The Small House of Uncle Thomas\" and\nbased, one must believe, on \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\",\nthe ballet was danced in a style we seldom see,\nwith a great deal of subs i du ary stage craft tinsel streamers for snow, stage hands setting 'waves running along a white cloth strip to\nrepresent a river, and so on.\nOf the many songs, \" I Whistle a Happy Tune\"\nand \"Hello, Young Lovers\" should penetrate the\nnext few years with ease. And one expects the\n.show, in company with its forerunners, to become\nvery popular and enjoy a long run.\nit. Bonnett\nL.U.D. S. Festival of One Act Plays:\n'The Man Who Wouldn't Go To Heaven' by Sladen Smith\nThis was an ambitious effort on the part of the I.C. Dramatic Society, and Beryl Walker is to be congratulated on\na stimulating production of a difficult play. Perhaps a 'play with a smaller cast would have been more suitable.\nOnthe other hand, the aspiration of this piece is an\nexcellent _ sign.\nFrom'amongst the players G. Duff deserves special\nmention. He had the title role, which required a sincere\nportrayal, and this he managed well. After a rather\nshabby start he was in full voice and vigour, and his long\nspeech was passionately delivered while he made good use\nof the stage to give it stress and added meaning. R. Mel]01\nlooked every inch an angel, but though his manner was convincing his voice was not always so. Sheila Taylor,\nthough embarrassed occasionally by her hands a fairly\ngeneral fault - acted beautifully, and indeed was con-:gra tula ted by the adjudicator on the evening's best perform-ance. A fine, if somewhat formal, portrait of a gentleman\nof too many leisure s was given by Neil Blackmore, while\nRuth Barratt made a beautifully effective nun. There\nappeared to be one poorly oas t part - that of the lunatic.\nThis was pure character play and could have been delightful to watch, but R, Eycott, though dressed admirably, was\nevidently not adapted to this particular role, and could\nnot develop^ts_ potentialities. The dress was imaginative and resourceful; and the\nlighting, a feat of manipulation it seemed, well done.\nIn all, a very worthwhile performance - but why don't more\ncome along and see for themselves?\nMPERIAL COLLEGE DRAMATIC\nSOCIETY\nPRESENTS\n\"THE HOLLOW\nBY AGATHA CHRISTIE\nDECEMBER 9th.12 th.7.30 RM.; "

    "content": "FF1% X ETTERS TO THE EDITOR\nDear Sir,I feel I cannot let Samuel Peep's \"Viewpoint\"\nin your issue of November l> th pass without comment.\nSamuel Peep's complains that I.C, was once again\nsplit into two groups on the subject of November 5th. Kr. Feeps even goes as far as to try and find someone\nto blame for this state of affairs. I feel that it is high time that Mr. Peeps and\nalso certain members of the Bag Committee realised that I.C. is a large college and that not everyone in it has the same views, ideas or tastes; and that it is only\nnatural that some people will want to have a rag and some\nwill want to go to H arlington. I remember, last year, members of the rag committee\ngetting up at' the Union Meeting when the arrangements\nfor November 5th were being discussed and saying that\nthere would be no support for a hop at H arlington. I was not able to attend the Union Meeting this year\nbut I understand a similar opinion was expressed. I went to the Hop at H arlington last year and again this year and thought it very enjoyable; and judging by the\nnumber of people who went, a fairly large proportion of\nthe Union thought so too.\nIn view of these facts I hope that in future members\nof the union will be a little more careful before getting up at union meetings or writing to FELIX and claiming to\nrepresent the opinion of the College. Yours faithfully, D.J. Pain\nDear Sir, It has become obvious that the I.C.U. Council is now\ncompletely out of touch with the feeling among the rank and\nfile of the College.\nIt has therefore been decided by the Literary and\nDebating Society to hold a series of lunch-time debates\nto air matters -which are of interest to all members of\nthe Union.\nThe motion for10th December is \"that this House\ndeplores the attitude of I.C.U. Council towards Rags\nespecially those on November 5th.\" The President of the\nUnion has been invited to Oppose this motion.\nWe sincerely hope that a large and representative\nbody of students will attend to let Council know their views on this subject.\nYours truly, E.J. Just (President)\nS. Ruhemann (Vice President)\nN. F.E. Blackmore (Hon.Jun.Ires.)\nD.A. Langley(Hon.Sec.)\nB.H. Wyatt\nDear Sir, So brief was the mention of the Commemoration ball in your previous issue that I am urged to enter your correspondence. This, the major social event of the Imperial\nCollege year is, I think, an occ as sion when we should become\neminent members of society able to demand, and get, the best.\nFor most of us, with a students traditional financial, resources\nsuch occassions come seldom enough.\nI would like to put the question therefore, was the\nuninformed phalanx that seemed to look upon any deviation\nfrom the immediate vicinity of the dance-floor as a threat\nto the safety of the building, quite in keeping with the\ndignity of the occ as sion? And was it necessary for the\nstaff to push crates of empty bottles between the tables an\nhour before the ball ended, in an apparent attempt to clean up\naround us before we left? That these incidents, which I feel shouldn't have happen-ed, were relatively insignificant was I think due to the\nspirit of all those present and to Ccraldo who entered into\nthat spirit as well. I'm sure that everyone who went will look back on this year's Commemoration ball as a great social success, and as\nan event to which they must go again next year. Personally\nI would like to see the ball return to Grosvenor House.\nAlternatively perhaps Council can inform the management\nof the Royal Festival Hall of what it should already know:\nthat I.C. men, practiced in the art of Nov. 5th rags are\nnot long to be deterred by barriers on the stairs or locked\ndoors leading to the riverside gardens.\nl ours faithfully, D.V.

Would knobs for the controls be -too much\nto suggest? We do not all carry pairs of pliers in our pockets. -'\n\u00ab\n\u2022 >\n\"\n\u2022\n-\u2022 iy v Yours faithfully, K.J. Davis,\n3rd year Aeronautical Eng.\nDear Sir,I respectfully suggest that the issue of t ne proposed changes in the Union byelaws was decided upon rather hastily at the recent Union Cene ral Meeting.Somewhat scanty evidence was offered in favour of the proposed change\nand I submit tha'. some red ner rings successfully created suspicion and swayed the Union against su cn a change.\nThe proposed change was to permit members\nof the I.C. Union Executive Committee, who are still at College in the year following that in which they held office, to be full members of\nCouncil if they have not been elected already. For. the benefit of those who seem to be unaware\nof the composition of the Executive Committee, it comprises the President and Secretary of I.C.U., and the Presidents of the three College Unions, five in all. During their year of office they amass a wealth of information and, often, influence, and ha ve always sincerely devoted tn eir knowledge, and power such as it is, to wa rds the welfare of the student body.The proposed change means that these five may continue to serve the Union, if they wish, after they have relinquished office. Opposition to this change was in my opinion offered on fallacious grounds, as Is hall seek\nto show. It was suggested that any of these five persons who are not elected to Council by\nj l the existing machinery are rejected by their electorate as unsuitable. This I believe to be\nnonsense} elections for most offices in the Union are contested ones, and merely because the. electorate chooses instead of to rate chooses B instead of A they do not question A's integrity or suitability, they express \u2022Ja preference. Further, Presidents and Secretaries of Unions are not usually prepared to stand for, a second term of office, It being a case of once\n\u2022 bitten twice shy, not that their electorate rejects them. Finally, to clinch this matter, regard the facts. Of the fifteen executives of the last tii ree years, only two have 'not been nominated for succeeding Councils, and then for good reasons but they have not all been elected, and this ch ange is designed to obviate this. A second charge which was made against the change was that persons who were not elected to Council could not be representing their electorate. Again nonsense, for many decisions have\nto be made without Council members having the chance to consult the body which tiu eyre present, ma ny which are far too complex to offer for the consideration of their electorate \u2014 a Government\ndoes not consult the electorate before it reduces the butter ration! Hence I see .10 reason to ar gue that these special members of Council would be super flu os or undesirable. At the most the add it on s would be five in number, more than three would be rare, but at worst Council can outvote tii em by 23 to5 \u2014 I presume this would be when\nall the honourable members were representing their electorate, and the five rebels were up to\nsome ' . rick e ry of their own lln return for this Council would have the benefit of atleast one\nyears guaranteed experience of Union affairs, a sum total of which could not be passed on to any represent a. ive however photographic his memory.\nFinally, Sir, may I add that I did not present these views at the Union meeting, because I was not prepared for Ihe Union to reject are oom n end ation of its Joint Council. I consider the question of such import that I preferred to\nwrite this considered opinion rather than hurriedly gather a few t noughts in the seconds available for debate. I propose to ask the President if he will submit the same motion at the next UGM w. ien I hope that in the lig fl t of facts the\nUnion will reverse its last nasty decision., vf* Yours sincerely,7.

'Bo' arrived at Putney\ncarrying unknown objects beneath a blue shroud. On arrival of\nabout 200 loyal Guilcismen the shroud was removed to reveal\n\u2022two coffins, one bearing the inscription R.C.S. and the\ni other R.S. M. These were carried on the shoulders of none-too\n-soberly dressed Guildsmen who lead the procession to the I.C. boat house. A debate with the gentlemen in blue as to whether\nthe procession should proceed or not resulted in a decision\nto go forward - and carried by an overwhelming majority.\nMeanwhile, E.C. S. had gathered at the boat house. Their\narrival in twos and threes seemed to indicate that they did nc\n[\nnot take advantage of the very greatly reduced rates that can\nbe obtained from London Transport for very large party travel. B.C.S. welcomed the Guilds procession with a shower of flour\nbag\u00ae and explosives but by sheer weight of numbers, Guilds\ntook \"The Corner\". Here the coffins were placed for safe\nkeeping and remained there despite several attacks by both\nMines and B.C.S. The lack of success was due to lack of\nnumbers with the Miners (who, after all, should be congratulate^\non having some supporters even after mustering two crews) and\nfor want of the presidents lead for theE.C.S. After some activities of a secondary nature on the river Guilds, with due ceremony and Boomalackas, consigned the ,\ncoffins to the river and without being molested. Things\nlivened up as 'Bo' tried to depart. One despicable character\nviolated tradition by attempting to throw something in 'Bo\nHe was m& de'to realise his mistake by an involuntary\nassociation with the river. On the departure of 'Bo' some made their way bask to\nI.C. but it was too late in the day for a 'party'. A few\nGuilds men did'try to demonstrate a method of bringing-down\nthe ceiling in R.C.S. but were discouraged by a demonstration\nof firehose s with hot and cold running water.\ni The Say was rounded off by a \"free\" hop in the\niG jn, which was well filled, but not overcrowded, probably \u2022\n\"because it was on-published. So while the Boat Club\nwere enjoying themselves in style, their supporters I ware doing so on a slightly lower level; altogether an\nexcellent Morphy Day.\nTHE LORD MAYOR'S SHOW\nRain greatly reduced the number of Guilds men present at this year's Lord Mayor's Show. Vhat\nthe gathering lacked in numbers, it made up for in wit. This was much appreciated by the general public, who gave every indication of thinking( that the newspapers' report of students' activities on Guy Pawkes day were grossly exaggerated. Unfortunately some irresponsible individuals chose\nthe passing of the Lord Mayor's coach as the time\n:o. et off a Catherine wheel \u2014 which was too big; tn lei, off safely on the 5 th. The result was a sharp fallin tue public' s estimation of Guilds in particular, and students in general. It was\ngratifying to see from the behaviour of the rest 'of those present that the majority of students do\nnot approve of such activities. With the finish of the Lord Mayor's procession, Guilds staged a show of their own \u2014 in the opposite\ndirection to that taken by the rival show. But\n3o refused to travel at so low a speed as a Guilds man on foot and so at St. Pauls, after are sounding Boo malak a, Bo went back to S.

Due to lack of. coordination be twa en the architect responsible for Guilds\nand the designer of 3 wheel cars, the main entrance into\nGuilds was insufficient to allow the passage of the\ndriving mirror. A large notice advertised that this\nmarvellous specimen of automobile engineering was for\nsale - much to the surprise of its owner. It is\nrumoured that his audible expression of astonishment\nprompted the prominent member of the Guilds staff\naccompanying him, to suggest that in future he should\npark his means of transport elsewhere. This advice\nwas evidently taken to heart and by 5.00 the yellow\nthree-wheeler was again standing outside.

Large crowds in high spirits used to be the rule, and an atmosphere of lighthearted rivalry prevailed on those occasions. What\nhappened last Wednesday was a complete flop in the way of rags. The Guilds turned up with Bo,\nthe Spanner, and a bright idea in the^ way of coffins. The Kin es, reduced these day|s in total number, were playing a rug ger game and a hockey game ( so were the Guilds, but two teams out of150 and tw o teams out of800 ought not to be\nconsidered on the same basis.) The R.C.S., we feel, are principally to blame\nfor this failure. Two years ago they decided to boycott Morphy Day rags. Last year they marched across Putney Bridge and to the Boat house in traditional manner. This year they numbered\nroughly two thirds of the Guilds crowd , were in a group, and could have had a lot of fun had they any spirit. But lack of initiative and, even\nmore, of leader snip, prevented anything better than a halfhearted barrage of tomatoes coming\nout. The R.C.S. should make up its mind. Either they should entirely refrain from taking pant in the proceedings, allowing their members to do\nnothing beyond cheering and chairing their crews. Or they may fully back the rag spirited members.\nHalfhearted activity is worse than no activity in these matters. While we are about it, it might be as well to remind Miners how important it is that they back\ntheir college one very possible occasion. Their small number makes it imperative that they do.\nHOPALONG FELIX IS FOUR\nIt is a hard thing to have a reputation to maintain.\nThe FELIX Birthday Dance over the last two years has\nbuilt up one of such a high order that, when faced with\norganising it again this year, we felt quite nervous.\nAnother trouble with memorable occasions is tb* fact that\nnobody remembers what went on last year. After consider*!s train on brains and memories the FELIX Board has at last got something which we think will be quite as a a Being and\ninteresting an affair as last year's.( We can't count on\nthe fog coming down again, of course, but we're hoping.)\nHot\u00ae tha data - December 5th, and keep your eyes open for the sale oi tickets, as they are liable to disappear before j you can say ' Felix Dance' backwards. One indiscreet hint if the crack poets of I.C.c all for tickets, they will he arf something TO THEIR ADVANTAGE.\nCHRISTMAS COMPETITION\nleaders are invited to submit a menu for the most\nperfect dinner they think anyone can have. Wines to accompany each course may or may not be included. Results to be\nannounced in our Christmas number coming out on Dec . 11th so entries should be handed in this week. No prizes, as\nusual, except honour.\nREGIONAL LAPSE\nIt has been pointed out that Malaya and Sxam were\nomitted from our list of countries represented at I.C., published last week. _ _ _ _ \u201e . \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014\nKECOND-HAKD BOOK WEEK\nHave you any textbooks which you wish to sell? If so, sand your name and department, the name of the text-bo q fc and the price you are asking into 'FELIX' by next\nm Say. A classified list of second-hand books will appear\nii> the Christmas issue of Felix. The price of each insert will be Id. wh i oh should accompany your letter. You have to look pretty closely before you realise that there's a pun in that word. Perhaps I should\nexplain that it's going to be the name of the new univers it y newspaper. Can you see it now? Well, never mind\nAt long last the U.L. U. has regained enough courage\nto launch yet another weekly newspaper. Two dismal\nfailures take al on^ time before they are forgotten. The\npoint is, this time it is all DIFFERENT. It is a more\nambitious undertaking than the last two were, and like a large tackle in Rugby, hopes to achieve success by bull dozing. Well begun is half won, and they are going to go\nall out right from the beginning. Very well, you say,\nwhat about it? There, as Hamlet said, is the rub.\nIt requires considerable organisation. It needs\npeople in all Colleges and people from all Colleges. I.C. being one of the Big Four is expected to .come forward with\nhelp in all fields. If you like to help from here, help\nto sell it, or write about I.C. activities in it, or send\nsports results on to them. Or if you want to help 'over\nthere' (U.L. D., that is), they need sub-editors, artists, photographers, and just helping hands. It shouldn't take\nmuch of your time if you are good at parceling it and even\nif you are not, you can leave when you want to. \"The Sennet\" will start publishing next term - January\nEnquiries or offers of help should be sent in as soon as\npossible either to the Editor, FiiLIX, or to the Hon. Sec.\nI.C. Union.\n5S* An Anthology of poetry taken from college\nmagazines and newspapers of London University\nwill be published in January under .the title of 'Thames'.\nOnly a limited number of copies are' available, and can\nbe obtained through \"PHOENIX\". 'Thames' is essentially\na new venture, and if the first issue receives encouraging support the magazine will appear at regular intervals.\nThe price of the magazine will be one shilling. If you\n|. are interested will you please send your name and department to \"HKEMIX\", and a copy will be reserved in your\nname.\nTWO NEW SOCIAL CLUBS\nContribution time for all prospective writers: by w hio hI mean prose, poetry, cartoons, quips, and what have you.\nThe combined Christmas Birthday issue of FELIX\noom es out on Deo.11, and lighthearted contributions are invited. If we get enough material, we propose\nto publish an 8-page FELIX at the same price. PHOENIX, spring term, needs contributions too. These should be handed in by Dec. 4th at\nthe latest. Good news for those that like more social activities. \"\nThere is a new Social Club that has come into being last\nfortnight and another one will probably be formed in the\nnext few days. The Social Clubs require a minimum of\n20 members for each new club and both have fulfilled this\ncondition.\nThe Billiards Club was in embryonic form at the end\nof last session and has now been fully organised. It\nhas an \u00bb\"\"\"\u00bb' subscription or 5/-, and will operate\nthroughout the year in the Staff Common Room, Beit Building. Ladders for billiards and snooker will be hung up\nthere, to be operated in the normal fashion.\nOlnb Officers:\nCaptain: Dr. R.T. Severn\nHon. Sec: V. Barnes (Room 97, I.C. Hostel)\nCommittee Members: Dr. L.T. Owen\nM. Abbott\nB.P. Hitchen\nUNESCO sponsor a chain of Clubs called International\nRelations Clubs, are for the very general purpose of\ndeveloping and increasing mutual understanding amongst\ndifferent peoples; in most cases, they also help prospective travellers by way of first-hand information on\nvarious countries. This aspect should especially appeal\nto members of I.C. who go all over the world in pursuit\nof pleasure and profession. The list on the general\nInternal notice-board already exceeds 20, but many more,\nespecially from this country, would want to join the Club\nand make it a success. This Club would probably be\nstarted from Dec. 2, when the Social Clubs Cccmittee meets.\nI OMISSION\nImperial College Christian Union, in cooperation with the University Christian Union, rana Mission in I.C. during the week 1 5 th22 nd Nov.\nThe great thing about tn is activity seemed to\nme to be the extremely practical way in wh i ah things were organised. To take just one instance, publicity. It is hard in1.3.to get the student body as a whole interested in anything but the most frivolous of plans.3 ut ICCU's neat,\ntasteful and quiet placards, displayed at strategic points th rou gn out the College did this with\nthe minimum of fuss. Lectures were arranged with an eye to the students' time restrictions, and more important, they stuck to those schedules.' Sandwiches on\nsale' during the lunchtime lectures was also well received. What the Mission achieved during its course is nard to say, and indeed the effects will not be\nseen immediately. It is a fact, however, that t ke Resident Mission er, Mr. Metcalfe Collier, made a deep impression on all i hat he met during t ne week.Was it Sy impression, or was it just another\ncase of student reticence, that there were very few questions asked of the speakers? Where there\nare no eu est ion after a meeting, it is hard to est i mate the extent to wh i cn the lecture has 'sunk\nin'. The only way t of indo/ fit now will be to wat cn th s student body for some time, and I hope the( ICC U. will not be disappoint ed*ith the results. "
