    "content": "FELIX PROFILE THE BAND When organising da noes, the main worry of club secretaries used to be the band. Now,\nthanks to the excellence of the band known\nvariously as The Band, Bryan Spooner' s Boys, or the I.C. Band, they worry no more. Quite apart from their high standard of playing, the antics of. some members has given the Band a very secure place in the hearts of hop goers. The band plays willingly and heartily, joins in the dancing now and again, and not infrequently carries on in the Hostel after the public festivities are over. Nobody can say\" the band was formed. It just happened. Bryan Spooner was practising his alto a a x in Room B when Tull is Sutherland walk ed in and said,\" I play piano.\" A week later Roy\nFerris saw Bryan reading the Melody Maker, and\nsaid he played trumpet. This was the nucleus.. During '52-53 the band played regularly at Northern Poly, under Bob ( the drummer) Adrian' s name. This session, Bernard Dodds arrived a tI.e. and took over lead alto from Ron Baker. Bob Adr ian and Tony Tolhurst( bass) left, and Jimmy\nBarker took their places. here are brief sketches of the members of the band. The members wrote about each other, so\nthat we can safely assume the accounts to be faithful a in d unbiased.~ John Bryan Spooner\". The \" Paul Adam\" of the Band, hopes that nobody remembers the first band he played in at College, the Imperialists. Fortunately, that was four years ago, and most\npeople who heard it have left. It wasn't until the beginning, of the present session that Bryan relented and ran the band under his own name, but \" after each Carnival he has threatened to chuck away his alto and give it all up.\n.His musical career started5 years ago,\nas a member of the\". er by shire Youth Orchestra, and he also had interests in the c noir's female Beotion. On entering College, he\njoined the I.C.O rc nest ra, but soon found that \"going straight\" was not his me tier. Bryan is in his first year as a.P.G. in the Aero dept., where he is studying fatigue(?) \u2022\u2022 He\nplays rug ger for Guilds and I.e., and was on oe Been performing cartwheels down the main street at Cambridge.\nNELSONS COLUMN James Tull is McLean Sutherland. Never mention the Guilds Carnival to Tull is surely the best entertainment in the Cabaret. Claims it was due to the whisky being Irish( not to mention the half pint of rum.)\nTull is was born many years ago, and has played the accordion, and piano for most of them.\nDuring his childhood( can't remember it) he was\na Junior tap dancing Champion of Scotland. Tull is graduated at Edinburgh in Physics and is now doing aP.G. course in Geophysics. His arrival in the hostel has coincided with many noisy parties, the strains of the\" Saints\" having reached as far as Miss Pry and the sorting staff of the G.P.O. in Exhibition Road.\nInterests are music, liquor and women,\nbut likes them alltogether he must surely be the champion whisky drinker in I.e. Roy Aug as te Ferris, another founder member, plays the trumpet. He came to Guilds in1952 with the intention of becoming a civil engineer. In the two preceding years he had toured Europe with the London Schools athletics team and the L.S. Symphony Orchestra. Rug ger is one of his major interests, and he\nhas appeared in the U.L. rug ger team. Roy\nalso claims to have appeared as an extra in about 2 5 films, among them Ivanhoe and Doctor in the House.\nRoy's interest, most of them apparent by\nnow, are rug ger, music, travelling round Europe and a very special girlfriend. The\n' last two he sometimes combines in the form of\nweekends in Paris. Bernard j jo a a arrived at College this year,\nand is1 st year Aero. He played oboe in the London schools Symphony Orchestra, where he met Roy\nFerris. In the land he pla j salto sax.\nBernard' s interests, apart from the usual three,, are in flying* he holds a pilot' so ert if io ate. Tony Pea roe is20, and has been playing double bass for5 years. He now works in Debenham and Free body' s as a furrier. Tony is an ardent fan of modern jazz and has played in places as famous as the51 \u00bb Flamingo, and Robin's Most,\nfie caused much consternation Dy mentioning that\nhis. father is vicePresident of the Musician's Union. George \"Ginge\" Sherwood played the'., tem or sa>\nsince the Band'sino ep tion. During the night he\nworks on the newspaper trade during t ne.. day he\nsleeps,. He admires the styles of Flip Phillips and Tommy Whittle, and turns green at the ment ion of t ne Mines Carnival. Noel \"Jlmm.v\" Barker. The old man of t ne band - 3 2 . Has been playing drums for years, mainly in R.a.F. Command Bands,\" from which he\nwas de mobbed IS months ago. Is now an inspector in Vickers Armstrong s Experimental Department.

Cross-oo un try Club sent three\nteams down South to run in an invitation point-to-point\norganised by the Brighton and Storrington Foot Beatles.\n1.0. first team, oom posed of Pain (3rd), Huxford (4th) Bowler (6th) and Dearden (7th) took the team trophy, but\nthe most interesting performance from the point of view\nof this paper was that of a team oom posed entirely of\n\"Felix\" men. This new Journalistic venture as conceived\nby the Sdltor himself, who distinguished hi a self by being\nthe only member of this team to train at all seriously for the event. However, of the four team members, Mr\nStarmer was lying fourth at the half-way mark. Previously\nat the first water-jump, Geoff Grimshaw, Coming Events\nfidit or, who had led the four up to that point, entered\nthe mid, and came out minus a shoe. At this juncture,\nhe was heard by Doug. Inmen, R.C.S. Salesman, just over-taking, to remark: \"xxxx xxx.1\". Meanwhile, Bill Hudson,\nCirculation manager, and Geoff. Starmer were having a tussle between themselves and a Brighton A.C. runner.\nThis was eventually won by Bill, whose indignantly bris t ling face-foliage must have thoroughly cowed the opposition.\nFelix came fourth, there being only one other team\nrunning besides the I.C. three. We are looking forward\nto further such progressive journalistic enterprises, and\na Felix XT may shortly be seen at Lords.\nAND NOW THE U.L. SWIMMING CUP In the University championships held last Friday and\nSaturday I.C. shared first place -Jith University College\nand Battersea, each gaining 20 points. This is the\nfirst time I.C. has been in the first place in this competition and the first time there has been a triple tie. It was acre di+ Vble performance by the team of\neight entered.\nI.C.s principal hope in the individual event was-Brian Manley, swimming in the 100 yd s. backstroke.\nBe was narrowly beaten into second place by Mike Clark,\nthe U.L. president, the two being old rivals. Our only\nother place wan gained by Gordon Stewart in the 100\nyd s. Butterfly. Points were, however, well divided\nbetween a number of the clubs competing, as is usual in the U.L. championships with so many colleges, and it remained for the two team races, which counted doable\npoints, to decide the competition. I.C.\"s team,of\nMaaley, Stewart, Lampard, and MoChesney, gained first place in the Medley 1\"slay, and in the Freestyle team race\nthe same teas w4t8 \u00bb Hay for Lampard surprised U.C. and\nBattersea by beating both and gaining first place.\nROW IN GHammers\u21221\nt>iga g atta,0 a Saturday May 8th, the I.C. second Till raced at\nTT KII HII ml Mi Regatta, winning their first heat against\nBarclay's Bank and Thames Tradesman comfortably by over\na length.

Containing two\nnew men, the second eight met London, their opponents ofthe previous week, in the first heat. Holding London very\nwell off at the start by striking40, they kept level with them until over half-way, when London drew away to\nwin.by nearly half a length.\nWith a substitute rowing in the or ew, the first eight\nmet Gladstone R.C. and University College & Hospital B.C. in the first heat of the Thames Cup. After a fast start\n1.0. did not settle down, and were not getting a solid finish. Half-way the three crews were level, but near the\nfinish Gladstone drew away to win by half a length.\nIn the U.L.

W.S.C. excelled itself, by beating L.S.E. in the\nfirst round of the University championship on Saturday,\nMay 15th. The score was 6-3 despite the fact that thi* team had had little practice and that it was the morning\nafter the Silwood dance,\nCRICKET The first XI have started the season rather poorly.\nHowever, the team contains a wealth of potential talent\nand it is to be hoped that this will soon reveal itself In the first match against Reading University, I.C. batted first on a perfect wicket, but were dismissed for\n142. Only Hanmaton, Heam and Kitchener scored more\nthan 20, and Reading duly won in a canter.\nI.C. dismissed Hillingdon for158 but again batted\npoorly and could amass a mere 110. Against Old Sinjuns\nsome excellent bowling by Jordinson (6 fr r23), well supported by Brown and Ault, put I.C. in a dominating\nposition, require ing only 100 to win. But the batting \u2022\nreached a new minimum. Finally wanting three to win in the last two overs with the last man in, I.C. could only\nmanage a pathetic draw at 98 for9.\" it chen made 31 but\nreceived only spasmodic support.\nBy far the best performance was against a good\nWembliy team who were dismissed for158 by some fin, aggressive bowling by Brown (7 for57) and good fielding. Rain then put an end to proceedings.\nWhen the batsmen show more confidence and aggression\nthis team is capable oi' great things.\nThe Sunday XI scored a win over Baygreen, thanks\nmainly to a fine fifty by Dr. R.T. Severn, who thus endangered his pla oe in the side as it is well known that\nhe performs this feat only once annually. The all-Welsh\nfast opening attack of Brown and Weale proved very effective and Weale hit the stumps at least once. In the\nnext match some new blood is being introduced in the shape\nof D.K.

    "content": "4 FELIX LETTERS TO THE EDITOR Sir,\nAs the re pr sent at ive of I.C. Union on the U.L. U. President's Council, I feel I should make se me comment\non the recent action of U.C. Union, reported in the\n\"Sennet\".\nThe reasons given for their action appear to he\nbased on three misinterpretations of the Principal at\ntalk with President's Council on May 3rd., plus diss at is faction at not being able to get their own way over the\ncard vote.\nThese thr-e mistakes are:\na) The Principal did not state that \"no amendments\nto the present U.L. U. constitution would be allowed for an indefinite period\". In fact he said that in view of\nthe youth of the new U.L. U. constitution (draw i up in1952), it did not seem advisable to pass major amendments at present.\nb) With regard to the new Union building, the\nPrincipal felt that the responsibility for the \u00a320,000\np.a. needed to run it was too great for an all student\nbody, but that the use made by students of the facilities provided by the new building would be controlled entirely\nby students. This is exactly the system in operation\nat I.C. which seems to work admirably.\no)U. C. Union Council seems to feel that the new\nU.L. Union building is being erected at the expense of\na do it i cn to U.C. Union's admittedly inadequate premises.\nIn fact, the money allocated by the U.C.C. to University\nCollege for building purposes has not been a ffe cr ed. Use\nmade of this money is a matter for the U.C. authorities,\n'j The I.C. Union Council rejected the idea of a card\n\u2022 vote on President's Council as they believed that the\nrole of a president on this Council is that of an\nexpert representative rather than that of a mandated\ndelegate. He has a duty to preserve the interests of\nhis own Union but an equal duty to help the University,\nof which the small-r colleges are in general the more\nactive members.\nThe new building in lla let Street is intended to\nbe complementary to the facilities of the individual\nUnions.\nWe, as one of the larger and more fortunate\ncolleges, may not appear to gain much from the University\nUnion except on the athletic side, but I am convinced\nthat I.C. Union has a great deal to offer U.L. U. and in so doing will derive the benefits to be obtained from\nbeing a member of a great and flourishing University\nUnion.\nTours etc.,\nJ.S. Harding.\nPHOTOGRAPHIC SOCIETY Last week, the I.C. Photographic Soo iet jr held their annual exhibition. Mrs. Mary Allen A. R.P.S was invited to judge the photographs submitted, me general standard of photography waa better than last year, although, individually, the best prints seemed in far i or to the work of previous prize winners. In the pictorial section,*' there was a tendency towards getting too much detail in one picture; as Mrs. Allen pointed out, some entries contained3 or4 studies all of which would have made good photographs. The subjects portrayed were both varied and interesting, with Coronation deo orations being the subject of more photographs than any other individual subject. The college activities section was disappointing. To judge from the number of entries,; I.C. would be thought to be on its last legs. 'The athletic clubs were especially poorly represented but a photograph of across country run definitely captured the spirit of the sport, although spoilt by the poor mounting. One of the sections which showed great improvement from other years, was that for technical photographs. The subjects chosen, such as\ncompression waves in wind tunnels and various phenomena connected with liquids, were of far more interest to the technical viewer than the collection of old and dilapidated locomotives& traction engines exhibited in this section In the past. Such questions as town at is the correct tax-ance of pictorial merit and composition, the extent of originality and the best way to mount\na photograph( which appears to be held almost as\nimportant as the photograph Itself) all of which influence the ultimate decision. Since the answers to these questions are largely a matter< \u00a3\n: opinion, it is surprising to find that Mrs.' Aliens' judging met with general agreement, as\nt ne comments heard during the exhibition seem to indicate. Dear Sir, During the last few days we, in London, have v dt ness ed some magnificent and very moving pageantry; it is not\njust a traditional show-off: it is not just an extravagant\nexpenditure of government taxes: it is neither conceit\nnor any other of our human vices; it is.something very\nmuch deeper, which although we have tried we have been\nunable to put into words.\nAlthough dwarfed by the majestic homecoming of our\ngracious Queen we witnessed two other events at the Albert\nHall la at week - the Boys' Brigade Meeting with the uniforms and bands - the University Presentation Ceremony\nwith the traditional mortar boards and academic gowns.\nAcademic gowns hm.m.m. m.' When as freshmen we arrived at I.C. as it is at\npresent, we noticed very little characteristic change\nfrom school life except perhaps that we are all somewhat\nolder. When as freshmen we arrive at I.C. as it will be, Just one of 3,000 other students, we shall find it still more difficult to take full advantage of anything\nthat a University has to offer, except those precious\nletters after our names.\nLet's attempt a Walter M itty for a while.' Imagine\narriving on that first day at college to he welcomed by\nstudents clad in academic gowns - the centuries old trademark of scholars and students; when we in turn eventually complete our first year we too would spend some six or seven shillings and proudly wear our own gowns. We\ncould distinguish the freshmen by their \"academic naked-ness\" ; we could distinguish scholars, post graduates and\nstaff by the type of gown; we should even be able to recognise guilds men, miners or scientists. A large number of students wear college scarves\nwhich indicates that some of us' at least are proud to be\nrecognised as students; pride is no s in within reason\nit is a very excellent characteristic. Academic gowns\nare more individual than scarves or blazers and would\nprevent us simulating a crumb in a tiered wedding cake\n(for such v/e hope will be the elegance of the new \"exp an sion\" buildings); gowns are dignified, traditional, inexpensive and very practical at one school it was recently\nsuggested that masters should no longer wear gowns; the\nidea was promptly dismissed on the grounds that the\nabsence of the gown would inc\\i rr too much expense on clothes\ntailoring and valeting.\" We would be expected to wear\ngowns within the college but not necessarily outside its precincts; gowns would be worn at mealtimes (which would undoubtedly improve the dubious table manners we so often\nhave to abide), at meetings and we could always hang them\nup whilst labour ing over files and drills in the work-shop.\nPerhaps, sir, we have imposed on your column too a neh, with these our wistful hopes; but why should we NOT wear\nacademic gowns?\nYours sincerely,\nDear Sir,.E Jp* \u00bb\u2022\u2022.\u00ab\u2022'_\nAre we to, believe' that^ our frontpage article \"Wine, Women and song\" is a true report of the visit of six responsible members\nof I.C.

Union Meeting was of more\ninterest for the informed, than for the average undergraduate. There were few verbal fireworks, but plenty of good plain speaking wh i oh was heard by the200 members present with great patience and restraint. The main business was taken up with re voting on two motions dealt with at the last Meeting of last term. It had come to the President's notice that these motions had been passed and rejected by\nunconstitutional majorities, that is majorities of less than100, For along time now no exact voting numbers\nhave been taken at Union meetings, and the President has used his discretion in deciding whether\nmotions have, been constitutionally carried through. This practice has obvious disadvantages, and for the time being the letter of the Constitution will be strictly adhered to, until such time as the matter is discussed in full and recommendations made to the Union. There is no wording in the Constitution about a neo ess ary Quorum for an I.C. Union Keeting, but in eff eot the ruling that all motions must be passed by a majority\nlarger than 100, if adhered to, will act in this way.\nAt this Union meeting several motions were blocked Toy\ntheir not possessing a \"Constitutional Majority\", and\nmost of these were about clear-cut issues where the Union\nhad obviously made up.Jts mind, although unfortunately\nnot in the right proportions to give the right voting\nfigures.\n\u2022The two motions in question. caused some stir last term, but the, discussion this time showed\nthat the weight of opinion had not shifted. The setting of a minimum price for hop tickets was again approved by a comfortable( constitutional) majority; although this time the minimum prices were 2/- single,3/6 double. The second motion to be re discussed was the attendance of I.C. Students at the Youth Festival this summer. In spite of much plausiBle arguing and quite a lot of filibustering, the Union was\nadamant against any recognition of such a politically coloured gathering by I.C. The feeling was that neither\" i delegates i\"n or\" observers\", nor\" unofficial observers\"\" were to be\nsent, in fact the Union wanted no one there who\ncould be given the official label of\" I.C.\" It is to be hoped that both these topics have\nnow been given sufficient airing at Union Meetings. Amongst the other business, the President informed the Union that details about the forth coming reconstruction of the Union Buildings would be made public as soon as possible. The President assured the Chairman of the Rag\nCommittee that the possibility of aU.L. Rag next November 5 th would be discussed this term. I.C.

Y/ear ne,27\"c c lent on Square, S.W.I, WORLD UNIVERSITY SERVICE\nAt are o on t meeting of I.C. Union, it was decided that\n, the Union should support W.U. S. Members who attended the\nmeeting will remember the explanation of the purpose of\nIV/.U.S. given by its British Secretary. However, for the\n(benefit of other members of the Union, I would like to explain something of the nature of W.U. S, and some of the\n'Ways in wh i oh wo can help.\nIn the aftermath of World War I, one English woman\nwas helping in relief work among students and lecturers in Vienna} she found that these were the only class for whom\nnothing was being done by the various relief missions.\nShe learned of professors of European reputation who were\nkeeping themselves alive by selling matches in the street.\nHer appeal for help came to the Universities of Europe,\nwho responded so greatly that it was decided to help\nStudents and staff in need all over Europe, So European Student Belief came into being, one of its principles being de ola red as follows: \"Relief will bo administered\nimpartially without regard to rao e, nationality, or creed,\nor any other eri teri on than proven need\", Despite\nseveral changes of name and structure of the organisation,\nthis, and all the other originally declared principles\nhave, bean faithfully kept throughout the past 34 y oars. Aa the aid of W.U. S, is concentrated where it is needed most, British and American stu a. on ts and staff hava\nbeen, in the main, contributors to, rather than rec ip i ents of, relief aid. Hence I would like to draw the\n'attention of readers to sara o posters on College boards\ndescribing conditions of students in other countries,\nparticularly in Asia, and givin\", some details as to how\nW.U. S. is helping them; I am sure that no-one can read\nthese posters without realising their debt to fellow-members of the world-wide university community.\nAlthough the W.U. S. Committee at I.C, has only Just\ncome into being, and has not yet taken any direct action,\nthe International Halations Club recently held a very\ngood concert of Music and Dancing from many parts of tha\nWorld, in aid of '.7,U.S. Funds. We are v< \u00bbry grateful for their help in this exo ellen t way, and hope that other\nClubs and Sooietles will boar this example in mind vi hen planning fu notions. We hope to arrange several efforts\nnext Session, including a Flag Pay during the Christmas\nTerm. We ask your support in the worthwhile cause of\nW.U. S.J.

So for the fifth time in two years I must begin an\nunrewarding( apart from a free copy) task\nw n ich usually results in several old. friends. failing to recognise me in t ne Union.\nIt is at rut n universally acknowledged that nobody taxes any notice of reviews of P no enix, and so the tc vio et ney invariably contain goes beg.in g.As a result, the main\narticle( that is, main according to leng tn) in this edition, \"Tne Ul tim ste Effect of Mechani s ation on Human Effort1' is an ungainly, disorderly gaggle of argument, the few points which are brought safely to the surface serving only to increase one's impression of ingeniously submerged scholarship. The\narticle may, even so, serve as an introduction to the fascinating field of num an relations nips so Beldom entered by the scientist. Amu oh worse mess, from a literary paint\nof view, is found in\" Criminal Responsibility\" as norte ned version of Dr. J. Gould' stalk at a recent Touchstone weekend. As pe oi men sent en ce may give some idea of my meaning.. i \"The social legal view of be navi our is prescriptive or restrictive, not descriptive, and ,\n,\n'\nenforcement is a necessary o ono omit ant.\", It.\\ is t ne duty of t neEd it or of Phoenix to ensure\nthat his material is readable.
