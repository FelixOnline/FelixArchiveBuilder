Yes, this news\nbrings a hearty,\njolly, honest laugh\nfrom the deepest\nregions of my heart.\nThe man himself, the\nwondrous Donald Trump has taken\non yet another pitiful \u2018progressive\u2019\nlaw and crushed it in his mighty,\nmassive, and muscular hands.\nJeff Sessions is one of the most\nhonest to God men that I have ever\nknown. He was a delight to have\nas a dinner guest just last week at\nthe Dasters\u2019 Mansion, and truly\na saint as the Attorney General.\nWith his expert guidance and\nability, I have no doubt that the\nUnited States will return to its roots\nof being an institution made for the\nAmerican people, by the American\npeople.\nHis decision to roll back the\ndevil\u2019s schemes to pollute our\nchildren\u2019s minds with sick \u2018choices\u2019\nand \u2018freedoms\u2019 is true progres-sion. Yet another huge victory for\nthose who will remain in the right\nof history. Finally, my daughters\nwill not have to fear a \u2018self-identified woman\u2019 man from staring at\nher body in the restroom. Those\npoisoned freaks will be taught\nthe true meaning of freedom.\nRemember, there is no freedom\nwithout restriction. True American\nfreedom is, and has always been,\ngrounded in the Christian values of\npurity. This refers to purity in our\nhearts and minds, and the ignorant\nand delusional \u2018progressives\u2019\nhave spent most of the 21st\ncentury\ncorrupting our youth with sexual\nimmoralities. Such hypocrites, as\nthey seek liberation with the devil,\nthey lobby to take away our God\ngiven rights to bear arms and freedom of speech. Pushing their toxic\nnarrative through fake news outlets\nsuch as CNN and Huffington Post,\nand taking away the voices of\ngood, honest Americans.\nYes, their motives are clear: by\npoisoning our young ones, they\ngain power over the future of our\nwealth. But we, the 0.01%, didn\u2019t\nget to our socioeconomic standings\nby being stupid. No, it was through\nour fathers\u2019 hard work and diligence and our continued hoarding\nof the country\u2019s wealth. So we will\nfight back, as we always have, by\nmaintaining our purity. Purity of\nheart and mind, as well as of the\nbody. That is correct, Demarco,\nyou will not be taking my daughter\nto prom this year, and you will\nonly refer to myself as Sir and my\ndaughter as Miss.\nDonald Trump, keep up the\nfantastic work. I continue to look\nforward to tomorrow, to see what\nthis magical man has to offer\nhumanity.\nI\ndidn\u2019t want to mention this\nscum again. I didn\u2019t want\nhis Cheeto flavoured name\nappearing anywhere near\nmy mouth, violating it with its\norange, rancid, artificial taste.\nI wanted to focus on the beauty\nof this world from my safe space\n(in my mum\u2019s bed) and just enjoy\nmy Matcha green tea latte (made\nfrom real Matcha, unlike those that\ntouch the tongues of uncultured\nswine who visit oppressive chain\ncoffee stores like Starbucks\n*literally vomiting right now*) and\nexplore my sexuality and emotions\nthrough Instagram comics.\nBut here we are. The oversized\noompa loompa has finally gone\nand done it. He\u2019s done the one\nthing that ensures that the age of\nself-determination and self-respect\nare far behind us. He has endangered our children in the most\ndisgusting and vile way possible.\nYes, this pussy-grabbing cislord has\ndoomed us all. He has rolled back\nthe guidelines for the protection\nof transgender students, citing\n\u201ca need to consider further legal\nissues\u201d.\nNow transgender students\nwill no longer be able to use\nrestrooms and facilities associated\nwith their gender identity. This is\nrape. There is no other way of\nputting this. These sick bastards\nare forcing innocent, curious children to adhere to expired social\nconstructs, and continue to cram\nsexual misinformation down their\nunprepared throats.\nMake no mistake, this is a\ndirect assault on the freedoms\nof all people: young, old, black,\nAsian, trans, gay, female\u2026 What\nis stopping these dictators from\n\u201crolling back\u201d on other discrimination laws? Perhaps they don\u2019t\nwant black people voting or else\nin 2020 they would get another\nBarack Hussein Obama Bin Laden\nat the helm of the \u201cgreatest country\nin the world\u201d (except it\u2019s not,\nbecause the USA is literally under\noppression at the moment). Or,\nmay the spirits forbid, they take\naway women\u2019s rights. Well alright,\nwomen barely have rights to begin\nwith, since men continue to deny\ntheir institutionalised, societal, and\ninternalised misogyny. IT\u2019S NOT\nTHAT HARD TO ADMIT YOU\u2019RE\nA SEXIST. What is stopping them\nfrom taking away the liberties\nthat women deserve? Of course\nI am not a woman myself, but I\npersonally believe that women are\ndefinitely the leaders of today and\ntomorrow. Watch as it will be a\nfemale scientist who will discover\nthe cure for cancer, not a man. We\nare of the past.\nWe have truly entered the darkest timeline, may the spirits have\nmercy on us all.\nExcept for you, white cis males,\nyou will be just fine. Oh and that\norange pile of dung as well.\nWOMEN WILL INHERIT\nTHE EARTH!\nDon Ma has had it with this\nregressive policy bullshit\nOur fathers worked\nhard for all our\ninherited wealth\nMon Da just wants to be held by\nDonald Trump\u2019s strong, manly,\nyuuuuge hands\nS\nV\n* Sponsored by\nPurity Rings LTD\n\n"

Both\nfeature characters conveying their inner struggles in\nhushed tones, and also revel\nin the sheer sensual beauty of\ncinema \u2013 in Moonlight\u2019s case\nthis is achieved with James\nLaxton\u2019s incredible cine-matography, which explores\nthe bewitching effect of\nlights: moonlight, neon lights,\nstreetlights. In Moonlight, like\nIn the Mood for Love, key\nscenes take place in a diner\n\u2013 this time soundtracked by\nBarbara Lewis\u2019 haunting Hello\nStranger rather than Nat\nKing Cole\u2019s Quizas, Quizas,\nQuizas \u2013 which acts as a third\nspace, between private and\npublic, in which connections\nare tentatively tested.\nTo call Moonlight a \u2018universal film\u2019 is to do it a disservice,\nto downplay its ensconcement\nin particular cultural contexts,\nto sand it down to a bland\nmessage on \u2018masculinity\u2019, as\nif a single word can contain\nthe film\u2019s multitudes. It is a film\nabout pain and love, yes \u2013\nalthough perhaps intimacy is\na better term than love \u2013 but\nit explores these emotions\nthrough the specific lenses\nof growing up gay, black,\nand poor. Flattening this out\nin pursuit of universality is to\nignore the particular features\nof the film\u2019s conception:\nJenkins and McCraney both\ngrew up in the Liberty Square\nhousing project; both had\nmothers addicted to crack;\nboth carry the weight of this\nexperience in their life and\nwork. Moonlight does not\ncontain any universal truth\nabout the nature of life, but\nrather particular truths, about\nparticular lives \u2013 it is all the\nmore powerful for it.\nFred Fyles\narmour for Chiron, one that\nleaves him invulnerable, yet\nconstrained. Just as in the\nsecond act, in which violence\nbegets violence, Chiron seems\nunable to escape the societal\nand familial influences that\nshape him.\nWhat is striking about\nJenkins\u2019 and McCroney\u2019s\nscript is the volume of silence\ncontained delicately within it,\nlike a delicate skein of words\nsurrounding a core of emp-tiness; at times, Moonlight\nplays like a silent film, a point\nunderscored by the scenes in\nwhich the sound cuts out, in\nfavour of Nichola Britwell\u2019s\nhaunting, string-heavy score.\nThe compelling performances\nof the three actors playing\nthe young, teenage, and\nadult Chirons \u2013 Alex Hibbert,\nAshton Sanders, and Trevonte\nRhodes, respectively \u2013 underscore this idea, all simmering\nwith intense, quiet physical-ity. All seem to be judging\neach line carefully, deciding\nwhether breaking through the\nisolation is worth the vulnerability it will bring; all too often\nthey choose to remain silent,\nmaking certain lines all the\nmore powerful, such as teenage Chiron\u2019s heart-breaking\nconfession that \u201cI cry so much\nsometimes I think one day I\u2019m\ngonna just turn into drops\u201d.\nHibbot\u2019s performance, which\nis the most mute of the three,\nis the most compelling; his\npresence on the screen is\nhypnotic, and his unflinching\ngaze completely magnetic.\nThis wordless performance directly contrasts\nwith Naomi Harris\u2019 role as\nChiron\u2019s mother. We follow\nher too, through a journey\nfrom crack-addict to tentative\nrehab inpatient, in a narrative\nthat runs parallel to Chiron\u2019s;\nthe two are tied together\nwith shared trauma. By turns\ncomforting and intimidating,\nHarris is able to effortlessly\nricochet between moods in\nthe blink of an eye; in one\nterrifying scene she asks teenage Chiron to let her into their\napartment, staring straight\ndown Jenkins\u2019 lens like a\nwoman possessed. The fact\nthat she filmed the entirety\nof her scene over only three\ndays just adds to the tremendous achievement.\nJenkins has spoken about\nAlex Hibbert and Mahershala Ali are\nphenomenal in Moonlight \\\\ Alamy\nMoonlight |\nAmiraculous\nmasterpiece\nus to examine the patterns\nthat establish themselves in\npeople\u2019s lives, and the cycles\nthat the characters seem\nunable to escape.\nWe first see Little, as he is\nknown, running from a group\nof bullies, Jenkins\u2019 camera\ntrailing him in a tight, anxie-ty-inducing close-up. Taking\nrefuge in an abandoned\nflop den, Little comes across\na used syringe \u2013 the full\nimpact of the discovery is\nonly revealed later, when we\nlearn that his mother is a drug\naddict \u2013 and is eventually\nfound by Juan (Mahershala\nAli), a local drug dealer.\nWe were first introduced to\nJuan at the start of the film,\nin a dizzying tracking shot\nthat immediately establishes\nhim as a known figure in the\nneighbourhood \u2013 Liberty City,\nMiami \u2013 keeping its inhabitants supplied with crack\ncocaine.\nFrom the off, Jenkins is\ninterested in challenging our\nconventional ideas about how\na drug dealer should act:\nJuan and girlfriend Theresa\n(Janelle Mona\u00e9) take Chiron\nunder their wings; when\nChiron asks if he is a \u2018faggot\u2019,\nJuan replies \u201cyou can be\ngay\u2026but you don\u2019t have to\nlet anyone call you a faggot\u201d.\nJuan takes Little to the beach,\nteaching him how to swim in a\nscene that is more-than-remi-niscent of a baptism; Jenkins\u2019\ncamera bobs up and down\nbeautifully in the warm Pacific\nwaters. Chiron will return to\nthis beach in the next two\nacts, first literally, when he\nruns into Kevin and desire\nspills over into action; and\nlater only figuratively, as the\ntwo men re-explore that night\nin their memories.\nBut while Juan may want to\nprovide some kind of father\nfigure to Chiron, the fact that\nhe supplies the drugs that\nturn Chiron\u2019s mother into a\nmonster means he will never\nbe able to \u2013 a fact revealed\nin a crushing scene at the end\nof Act I. This sees the end of\nJuan\u2019s role in the film, but he\nechoes throughout Moonlight,\nwith the older Chiron modelling himself on Juan, right\ndown to the small crown on\nhis car\u2019s dashboard.\nPutting on Juan\u2019s appearance is like a mantle of\nBarry Jenkins\u2019 tale of the coming-of-age of a gay black man is\njust as good as you\u2019ve heard:\nMoonlight is a miraculous piece of\ncinema, one that tells the stories\nso often untold by Hollywood\nI\nn Barry Jenkins\u2019 masterful\nfilm Moonlight, the\ncoming of age of a gay,\nblack man is compressed\ndown into a mere 111\nminutes, distilled for your\nviewing pleasure.\nNearly split into three sections \u2013 revealing the structure\nof the play upon which it is\nbased, Tarell McCrary\u2019s In\nMoonlight Black Boys Look\nBlue \u2013 we follow Chiron, first\nas a child taken under the\nwing of a drug dealer, then as\na teenager mercilessly bullied\nat school, and finally as a\nyoung man revisiting figures\nfrom his past.

Sure you can use fancy lingo, such\nas pleasure, satisfaction, gratification, joy, and\neven gusto if you\u2019re that kind of person, but at\nthe end of the day, fun does the trick just fine.\nThe reason we make babies is because sex\nis fun. The reason we keep ourselves fed is because\neating good food is fun. The reason we push for social\njustice, is because being fairly and justly is fun. Printing\n2,000 copies of this self-indulgent paper every week\nis FUN.\nI guess in a way it\u2019s appropriate that this is the fun\nissue \u2013 we always had great timing. It\u2019s our last issue\nbefore nominations close and campaigning for the\nLeadership Elections begins. It\u2019s appropriate because\nif you\u2019re thinking of running, you should be thinking\nabout fun. The sabbatical roles (the officer trustee\npositions, the ICSM pres and the felix editor roles) can\nbe surprisingly hard, especially if you are even going\nto attempt doing a good job. Sure they can be easy,\nbecause you could just sit around all day doing fuck\nall and no one would bat an eyelid (with the exception\nof the felix editor \u2013 people would very quickly notice\nif the paper stopped coming out, or if instead of a\ncentrefold you just got a scan of my butt\u2026 though now\nthat I think about it...), but if you\u2019re planning on doing\nthat you really shouldn\u2019t be running in the first place.\nIf you\u2019re going to be running you need to think about\nthe enjoyment you\u2019ll be getting out of your work.\nWhether that\u2019s through problem solving, or caring\nfor people or publishing a pretty kick-ass paper\nevery week (with \u201cnew age centrefolds\u201d and snazzy\ngraphics). If you don\u2019t get a high from carrying out the\nduties of the role, then you\u2019ll either not care enough\nto do your job properly, or give it your best and crash\nand burn.\nThe sabbatical roles are a great opportunity for\nstudents to get their hands dirty and bring about some\nmuch needed change. And with the right people filling\nthese roles they can be and should be fun.\nSo if you\u2019re running, good luck and if you\u2019re not, you\nhave till Sunday to change your mind!\nT H E\nT E A M\nAddress | felix, Beit Quad, Prince Consort Road, London, SW7 2BB || Telephone | 02075948072 || Printed by | Mortons Media\nGroup Ltd Media Centre, Morton Way, Horncastle, Lincolnshire, LN9 6JR || Registered Newspaper | ISSN 1040-0711 || Copyright\n\u00a9 felix 2016\nEditor-in-Chief | Lef Apostolakis || Deputy Editor | Mattin Mir-Tahmasebi || News Editor | Matt Johnston, Joanna Wormald || Comment\nEditors | Vivien Hadlow, Tessa Davey, Jonathan Masters || Culture Ringmaster | Fred Fyles || Culture Editors | Indira Mallik, Meryl Anil,\nAnurag Deshpande, Theo Farah, Simran Kukran || Puzzles Editor | Hamish Beck || Clubs & Societies Editor | Abigail de Bruin || Science\nEditor | Lizzie Riach, Ipsita Herlekar || Millennials Queen | Tessa Davey || Millennials Editors | Saad Ahmed, Sanjay Battacharaya, Matt\nJohnston || Sports Editor | Sam Smith || Illustrator | Nathan Macabuag || Copy Chief | Mattin Mir-Tahmasebi || Copy Editors | Ipsita\nHerlekar, Selin Olenik, Vivien Hadlow, Alex Adler, Aishwarya Pattar, Anna Shukla || Cover & Centrefold | Joe O\u2019Connell-Danes\nfun\n\n"

What about that oh\nso easy to make soup recipe\nyou stumbled upon the other\nday? I mean, I know you want\nto eat them all, but you don\u2019t\nwant to waste all your life\ncooking \u2013 a.k.a. becoming\na chef \u2013 and you promised\nyourself that you are going to\nlose a few pounds so you\u2019re\nmoney to spend on a nice\ncut of meat, I will be writing\nabout something that is not\na cake \u2013 my weak point. For\nme, this recipe has a nice\nstory because this is the first\ntime my friend (read it as that\nspecial someone) told me\nthat normally they hate pork\nbut they have no problem\neating mine because it\u2019s just\nso good \u2013 and there\u2019s nothing\nsexual in that statement.

All signs point to\nLinus Sandgren winning, for his technicolour dream La La\nLand \u2013 the cinematography was the best part of the film.\nHowever, nothing is set in stone: the American Society of\nCinematographers presented their award to Greig Fraser,\nfor Lion, so don\u2019t be surprised of an upset on the night.\nShould win: James Laxton (Moonlight) | Will win: Linus Sandgren (La La Land)\nBest Original Screenplay\nAdapting the works of another is a daunting enough pros-pect, but equally intimidating, if not more so, is creating\na world completely from scratch. In this respect, my allegiances for Best Original Screenplay are split: on the one\nhand, we have Yorgos Lanthimos\u2019 and Efthimis Filippou\u2019s\nscript for The Lobster \u2013 a masterful black comedy, which\nmanaged to invent an uncanny Earth-like world; on the\nother, we\u2019ve got Mike Mills\u2019 equally-astonishing script for\n20th\nCentury Women \u2013 a masterful work, combining witty\ndialogue with a multitude of visual images and film clips.\nMills\u2019 screenplay is worth reading as a stand-alone piece\nof art, and for that it\u2019s my top choice for the award. In all\nlikelihood, however, the prize will go to Kenneth Lonergan\nfor his drama Manchester by the Sea, and to be fair to\nLonergan, it would be well-deserved.\nShould win: Mike Mills (20th\nCentury Women) | Will win: Kenneth Lonergan (Man-chester by the Sea)\nBest Original Score\nAt this point, it seems pointless to debate the winner of\nthis award. It will be Justin Hurwitz, whose score for La La\nLand has been picking up plaudits all season. Hurwitz\u2019s\nmusic is certainly good, although I would argue that little\nof it is memorable \u2013 a cardinal sin in the musical theatre\nworld. On leaving the cinema after seeing La La Land, I\ncould remember one song \u2013 two at most \u2013 and the rest I\nhad to listen to online. This contrasts unfavourably with my\nexperience of Mica Levi\u2019s score for Jackie, which wormed\nits way into my brain. Like in Under the Skin, the score\nis filled with haunting strings, sliding between notes until\nthey find a place to land. Levi should really be the winner,\nfor a score that accentuates the haunting nature of Jackie\nwithout ever detracting from the on-screen drama.\nShould win: Mica Levi (Jackie) | Will win: Justin Hurwitz (La La Land)\nBest Adapted Screenplay\nThis year\u2019s nominees are marked by the fact that none\nof them were based on a straight-forward novel: instead\nwe\u2019ve got films based on plays, short stories, and\nnon-fiction books. Fences marks an unusual posthumous\nnomination for August Wilson, whose play formed the\nbasis of the script. Eric Heisserer does well to adapt the\ncomplex short story Story of Your Life into Arrival; similarly\nAllison Schroeder and Theodore Melfi manage to make a\nbalance between true life and drama in Hidden Figures.\nIn my opinion \u2013 and it seems likely that the Academy will\nagree with me \u2013 Barry Jenkins and Tarell Alvin McCraney\nshould win for their screenplay Moonlight, based off the\nplay written by McCraney; it manages to retain the original play\u2019s structure, but bring it wholly into the world of\nfilm, and for that, they should be rewarded.\nShould win | Will win: Barry Jenkins and Tarell Alvin McCraney (Moonlight)\nbetween La La Land and Moonlight, and what a contrast\nthose two films are: Moonlight is a film that is political to its\nbones, while La La Land is the very opposite, almost anathema to politics, light and fluffy to the core. In a year like\nthis, where the political arena is dominated with hatred\nand division, it would seem remiss for the Academy to not\nplace a film about a gay, black, poor man at its heart,\nshowing that these stories are needed now more than ever.\nMoonlight is also, in my opinion, a far superior piece of\nwork to La La Land, which doesn\u2019t have much to say.\nAt the end of the day, however, it seems most likely\nthat the Academy will choose to award La La Land the\ntop prize, since it\u2019s a celebration of everything those in\nHollywood hold dear: themselves. While I would love for\nMoonlight to take home Best Picture, I\u2019d put my money on\nLa La Land \u2013 above all, a safe choice.\nBest Picture\nS\nince 2009, the Best Picture nomination list has\nswollen from five to a maximum of ten, and\nas a result the category tends to feel bloated.\nThis is definitely the case this year, when a\nnumber of the nominees provoke little more\nthan a surprised \u2018huh?\u2019 Hacksaw Ridge and\nHell or High Water both seem completely unlikely to come\nanywhere near the top prize. Similar could be said for\nLion, Fences, and Arrival, which \u2013 despite being good\nfilms \u2013 don\u2019t seem to have a chance of reaching the top.\nManchester by the Sea could get a late-in-the-day burst of\nsupport, but it seems more likely to pick up the acting and\nscreenwriting awards; similarly Hidden Figures, while one\nof the most popular films nominated in terms of box office\nrevenue, seems unlikely to make it.\nSo, at the moment, it seems to be a two-horse race\nShould win: Moonlight | Will win: La La Land\n\\\\ Alamy\n\\\\ Alamy\n\\\\ Alamy\n\\\\ Allstar\n\\\\ Film Society of\nLicoln Centre\n\\\\ Fox\nAcademy Awards 2017 | Our predictions of\nBest Supporting Actor\nA rare category in which La La Land isn\u2019t nominated, the\nBest Supporting Actor award is also noticeable in having\nthe only nomination for Nocturnal Animals, which was\nwidely seen to be one of the main snubs of this year\u2019s\nawards. Lucas Hedges is a welcome addition to the shortlist for his explosive performance in Manchester by the\nSea, and Dev Patel could provide some competition for\nthis category, for his role in Lion, in which he was able to\ndisplay great emotional control. The award is most likely\nto go, deservedly, to Mahershala Ali for his role of Juan in\nMoonlight. Juan is only present in a few scenes in the film\n\u2013 he\u2019s a neighbourhood gang member and drug dealer\nwho becomes a father figure for the young Chiron \u2013 but\nhe makes a powerful impact, leaving an impression on the\nremainder of the film.\nShould win / Will win: Mahershala Ali (Moonlight)\nBest Actor\nA short time ago, it seemed that Casey Affleck had this\naward locked down for his performance as an emotion-ally-repressed, grief-stricken janitor in Manchester by the\nSea \u2013 and so he should, his performance is great. But\nnothing is certain in Oscar-world (except my judgments on\nwhat should win; those are infallible). With the increased\nattention on Affleck, sexual harassment lawsuits have\ncome to light, which could put a dent in his chances. And\nwho\u2019s that coming up on the horizon? Why, it\u2019s Denzel\nWashington, whose performance in Fences, which he\nalso directed, has been in second place behind Affleck\nall awards season. He could prove to be a challenger to\nAffleck, especially since Hollywood would never rehabilitate or celebrate anyone who\u2019s been accused of sexual\nharassment\u2026 oh wait. It\u2019s probably Affleck\u2019s year then.\nShould win / Will win: Casey Affleck (Manchester by the Sea)\nBest Supporting Actress\nViola Davis is widely predicted to take home this award\nfor her role as Rose Lee Maxson in Fences. Michelle\nWilliams\u2019 performance, also up, in Manchester by the Sea\nwas a complete stand-out of the film for me, a deeply powerful performance born out of a chasm of grief. Octavia\nSpencer and Nicole Kidman were good in Hidden Figures\nand Lion, respectively, but at this point the nods seem\nlike\u2026 well, little more than just nods. For me, it would be\nfantastic if Naomie Harris were to take home the top prize\nfor her astonishing performance in Moonlight: in a film\nbursting at the seams with incredible actors, Harris left the\nstrongest impression as a crack-addicted mother, whose\nnarrative arc never quite reaches redemption, but comes\ndamn close. Plus she filmed it in three days \u2013 girl\u2019s got skill.\nShould win: Naomie Harris (Moonlight) | Will win: Viola Davis (Fences)\nBest Actress\nJust one gripe before I get on with the predictions: it is a\ncomplete travesty that Rebecca Hall has not been nominated for her central turn in Christine. Anyway, moving\non\u2026 Meryl Streep has her customary annual nomination\nfor Florence Foster Jenkins, but she has no chance of\nwinning. Similarly Ruth Negga doesn\u2019t seem to stand much\nof a chance, but it\u2019s great to see her break through. This\nleaves us with a three-horse race. Emma Stone has been\ngarnering a number of awards for her turn in La La Land,\nbut I think (or hope) the role is too light to stand up to the\nAcademy. As such, the award will likely go to Natalie Portman for her portentously campy performance in Jackie,\nand she would be a worthy winner; but for me, Isbelle\nHuppert\u2019s powerhouse performance as rape-victim-turned-avenger in Elle deserves to take home the top prize.\nShould win: Isabelle Huppert (Elle) | Will win: Natalie Portman (Jackie)\nBest Director\nIt seems likely that Damien Chazelle will snatch this award\nfor La La Land, but it would be a pyrrhic victory, given\nthat his far-superior breakout feature Whiplash didn\u2019t even\nearn him a nomination. Chazelle manages to mine the\nclassic trope box of old-fashioned Hollywood musicals, but\ndoesn\u2019t add anything new to the equation. Kenneth Lonergan similarly takes cues from emotionally bleak, realist\ndramas, but seems to be able to draw out better performances from his cast. In an ideal world, however, the prize\nwould go to Barry Jenkins for his even-handed portrayal\nof a gay black man growing up in poverty, Moonlight.\nMoonlight\u2019s plot is never overshadowed by Jenkins\u2019 mastery with the camera, despite the numerous awe-inspiring\nshots. The fact that this is only Jenkins\u2019 second feature \u2013\nand his first on a major budget \u2013 makes his achievement\nall the more astounding.\nShould win: Barry Jenkins (Moonlight) | Will win: Damien Chazelle (La La Land)\n\\\\ Alamy\n\\\\ Wikimedia\n\\\\ Alamy\n\\\\ SBS\nProduction\n\\\\ Allstar\nHeadingtoanOscarspartyandunsureofwho\ntorootfor?NotseenFences,butwanttopretend\nyou have?

An impactful cold\nopen shows us the beginnings\nof the concert as the energy\nand life seen juxtaposes\nwith the foregone conclusion\nalready simmering in the\nviewer\u2019s mind. But the footage\nends abruptly, long before\nthe tragedy would occur. The\nspectre of dread this evokes,\nhowever, hangs over the rest\nof the feature.\nThe piece is measured with\nits pacing, spending the first\nthird of its runtime laying\nthe building up our central\nsubjects. At its core, this is a\nstory about two best friends,\nand their almost extraordinarily clich\u00e9d friendship. We\nfocus, initially, on the shared\nadolescence of Queens of\nthe Stone Age frontman\nJosh Homme, and Eagles of\nDeath Metal frontman Jesse\nHughes. We hear about the\nbeginnings of their friendship\nand the \u2018fucking John Hughes\nclich\u00e9\u2019 that was the first time\nthey really got to know each\nother. In their own words,\nJesse and Josh share this\nstory with us. Jesse, a stereotypical square is being bullied\nat a high school party; forced\ninto the pool and not allowed\nto come out. Josh, lumbering\nViking that he is, walks into\nthe party and comes to his\nrescue. Exploration of the\nincident sets up the major\nthemes of the documentary:\nguilt and responsibility. In this\ncase, Jesse\u2019s feeling of guilt\nfor not standing up for himself\nand fighting back, and Josh\u2019s\ngrowing feelings of responsibility towards Jesse.\nIn fact, these frank, honest,\nand intimate interviews with\nthe pair form the emotional\nbackbone of the piece and\nreally help keep the audience\u2019s interest. For obvious\nreasons, more focus is given\nto Jesse, with his retelling\nof his childhood and early\nadulthood painting a picture\nof a man who has always\nstruggled to fit in, frequently\nbroken by circumstance.\nMany observers, myself\nincluded, have expressed\ndiscomfort with some of Jesse\u2019s statements. But for a man\nthat\u2019s already so haphazardly\nput together to take such a\nshattering blow?\nWell, it\u2019s incredibly hard\nnot to give him a free pass.\nIt doesn\u2019t help that, as with\nmany outspoken artists these\nNote: Not actually death metal\\\\\nHBO\ndays who are aren\u2019t the best\nat expressing themselves,\ndetractors are ready to\nbastardise and amplify certain statements over others.\nHanks, at least, goes to great\npains to portray Hughes\nsympathetically whilst still not\nshying away from addressing\nJesse\u2019s more controversial\nstatements. Homme too\nshows a vulnerability here\nthat, outside of his music, we\ndon\u2019t see much of.\nFollowing the story of the\nformation of the Eagles of\nDeath Metal, which again\nhighlights the responsibility\nHomme takes for Hughes, we\nmove onto the events of the\nBataclan. These are the documentary\u2019s most harrowing\nand tense moments,\nas we hear\nretellings\nof the\nNot quite the Beach Boys\\\\ Steve Agee\\HBO\nnight from those who were\nthere. Spliced in with interviews from the band are\ninterviews from members\nof the concert\u2019s audience,\ntogether with actual footage\nfrom it. The result is a frantic\nand sobering immersion in\nthe brutality of the attack.\nThis equalisation of performer\nand patron ties into the\npiece\u2019s title of \u2018nos amis\u2019; \u2018our\nfriends\u2019.\nIt codifies what Jesse talks\nabout throughout, the fact\nthat they were all in this\ntogether and consequently\nhow he feels responsibility for\nit. We also alternate between\nJosh\u2019s and Jesse\u2019s stories of\nthe night; Jesse as he struggles to escape, and Josh as\nhe finds out about the incident\nand tries desperately to do\nsomething about it. As these\nparallel odysseys unfold,\neach party\u2019s feelings of guilt\nover the night become clear.\nWhilst Hughes experiences\nsurvivor\u2019s guilt, Homme feels\nguilt over not having been\nthere to watch over Jesse, as\nhe always has before. That\nthis man and this band, who\nhave made fun and simplicity\ntheir vocation, must know\nfind themselves in the midst of\nsuch complexity and tragedy,\nis unfortunate.\nThere\u2019s plenty of star power\nto be found here, as the\ndocumentary even manages\nto get an appearance from\nBono. It goes without saying\nthat the feature has a kick-ass\nsoundtrack, sampling not\nonly EoDM\u2019s three albums,\nbut also QotSA\u2019s extensive discography. This is,\nundoubtedly one of the\nmost poignant and\nwell-crafted documentaries of the\nyear. While fans\nwill of course\nenjoy it, the\nwider audience may\nactually gain\nmore out of it;\ngetting to see\nfor themselves\nthe larger-than-life people we\nalready know Josh\nand Jesse to be.\n\\\\ At its core, this is\na story about two\nordinary friends and\ntheir extraordinarily\ncliched friendship.\\\\\n\n"

This year, she\nheadlined and curated a\nvaried line-up of emerging\ntalent. An art installation\naccompanied the show,\nwith the Wonderland theme\nin focus throughout. An\nanimation introduced her\nperformance, with a cartoon\nLittle Simz asking Cheshire\n\u201cWhy am I here?\u201d His\nresponse: \u201cSimply, you\u2019re\nhere to fuck up the balance\u201d.\nAjikawo\u2019s energy is on full\npelt from the start. The set list\nis based heavily off her latest\nLP, Stillness in Wonderland.\nThe tracks take on a new\noptimistic life with the live\nband. On the album, the\nvibe is hazy \u2013 it seems the\nwonderland is an escape\nSimz uses to cope with her\nstruggles. We\u2019re invited along\nto follow her in her journey\nthough the rabbit hole, and\nthe experience is immersive.\nEven when the lyrics are\ndark, her dynamism onstage\nmeans the mood is liberating\nrather than wallowing. On\nTrust Issues, she raps Nobody\nis an angel these days/if you\ndisagree please speak up\nplease say. It is clear Little\nSimz is at her most comfortable rapping and singing,\nis God Bless Mary, a song\ndedicated to her neighbour for never complaining\nabout the loud music next\ndoor. The audience gains\nperspective: Simbi is only 22\nand was working from her\nhome not long ago. Despite\nher success and critical\nacclaim worldwide, Little\nSimz has remained defiantly\nindependent and true to\nherself. Kendrick Lamar said\nshe \u201cmight be the illest doing\nit right now\u201d. Her style is\nmore hip-hop than grime,\nbut she is no stranger to the\nscene, having worked with\nan impressive set of artists\non the album. Ghetts and\nChip join her onstage for an\nelectric performance of King\nof Hearts, and for the finale\nof the show she is joined by\nStormzy and Kano for Dead\nBody.\nBy Simran Kukran\n\\\\ She might be the\nillest doing it right\nnow \\\\\nand she commands the stage\neffortlessly. Between tracks,\nthe atmosphere falters slightly\n\u2013 there is little introduction to\neach song and the fact that\nthis is her biggest show to\ndate starts to show. Despite\nher nerves, she never ceases\nto be lively and charming.\nA highlight of the show\nDo you like music?\nGet free music\nGet free tickets\nDid I mention FREE stuff\nGet in touch with music.felix@ic.ac.uk\nCome write about it!?\nJ\nust last week,\nCamden\u2019s very\nown Roundhouse\nopened its doors to\nartists and industry\nprofessionals as\npart of their Artist Toolkit Day.\nThe event included a series\nof performances, clinics, talks\nand collaborations during the\nweeklong Roundhouse Rising\nFestival.\nI made my way to the iconic\nvenue on Sunday morning,\ncollected my wristband and\nnestled into a seat amongst\nroughly forty others, pen and\nnotebook in hand, starry-eyed\nand eager to learn something\nI didn\u2019t know about the world\nof music. Around me, others\neyed up their peers. Some\nmade a daring effort to stand\nout with 90s inspired bowl\ncuts, snake skin knee high\nboots and in one instance,\na Hello Kitty bomber jacket.\nOthers were social butterflies,\nfloating from one guitar slinging twenty-something year\nold to the next with the oddly\nfamiliar: \u201cwhat kinda music\ndo you make?\u201d, or \u201cwhat\ngenre do you listen to?\u201d More\noften than not people smiled\nand shrugged: \u201cA bit of\neverything y\u2019know?\u201d\nSoon after, lights were\ndimmed, and the talks began\nwith the familiar squeal of\nmic feedback and a unanimous wince. We were taken\nthrough the various gears and\ncogs of the music industry.\nFirst with an introduction to\nthe world of PR, then licens-ing, management, publishing,\nbooking agents and finally\nthe label industry. The panel\nincluded speakers from Coda,\nImagem, BBC Extra and Universal Music each with their\nown set of tips, insider secrets\nand almost always a story\nof struggle, opportunity and\neventually success.\nThroughout the day we\nwere reminded that though\nthere was no fixed recipe for\nsuccess, you could only go so\nfar without a manager, label,\nPR agent and yada yada\nyada.\n\u201cCan I send in an application to a PR company or\npublisher?\u201d Someone asked.\n\u201cNot really\u201d replied the\nspeaker, \u201cwe don\u2019t accept\nunsolicited mail.\u201d\n\u201cCan I apply in hopes of\nunsolicited mail.\u201d\nSoon enough, there\nappeared to be a trend and\nwe were left baffled by the\ncatch-22.\nWith the means to make\nmusic becoming far more\naccessible and with music\nitself becoming far more avail-able, industry professionals\nhave had to shield themselves\nright in the middle of a web\nof industry professionals, they\ncurate their roster, represent\ntheir artists, but most of all\nthey deliver consistent talent\nto their peers. A manager\nwith a solid reputation are\nyour keys to the industry.\nThis way, PR representation,\nlicensing, and booking gurus\nare simply an email away. So\ninstead of trying to win over\nyour allies one by one, simply\nget yourself a well-respected\nmanager.\n\u201cCan I email a management\ncompany and ask to join their\nroster?\u201d\nIronically, management\ncompanies too do not accept\nunsolicited mail. However\nunlike their industry coun-terparts, these guys can be\nfound floating around the\nlive music scene keeping\ntheir eyes peeled for the\nnext big thing. And that\u2019s\nnot all. In fact, behind the\nscenes industry professionals\nwill frequently share hotly\ntipped artists to one another,\ntrying to gauge the interest\nof their peers. With their ears\npressed up against closed\ndoors, managers will listen\nout for chatter. The louder the\nchatter, the more appealing\nit becomes to add the artist in\nquestion to their roster.\nSo where does all this chatter come from?\nLets say you play a gig,\nor you upload a track to a\nstreaming website, or you collaborate with an established\nartist and somehow word gets\naround. More likely than not,\nthe news will be picked up\nby the safety net we called\nA&R scouts. Scouts dwell in\nthe corners of dingy clubs\nand gig venues and will often\nlook unassuming, sipping on\na pint of lager. The difference\nis, once they\u2019ve finished that\npint, they report straight back\nto HQ. Good, bad, or simply\nweird, the message gets back\nand nothing goes unmissed.\nWhy? Because nothing is\nworse than missing the next\nbig act.\nSo what does that mean\nfor you? Not much really. But\nunderstanding what goes on\nbehind the curtain is a nice\nlittle reminder that you and\nyour music do the talking.\nWith a couple of solid tracks\nunder your belt and a stirring\nlive performance, you too\ncould be the next big thing.\nJust remember, \u201cWe do not\naccept unsolicited mail\u201d.\nfrom the resulting fall out.\nIt appeared as though\ncompanies across the board\ngradually started relying on\nstamps of approval from their\ncontemporaries as a means of\ntime and resource management as they sifted through\nthe heaps of emerging new\nmusic.\nSurely this makes it more\ndifficult to land a deal with\nanyone in the industry?\nNope. In fact, this couldn\u2019t be\nfurther from the truth.\nInstead of having to impress\nmultiple members the industry\nwith your singer or songwriter\nskills, now you merely need to\nimpress one.

Why? WHY?\nCAPRICORN\nCRISIS\nChris\nDear Chris,\nI\u2019m writing to you because I\u2019m bored. Nothing in my life\nbrings me joy anymore. Not my Playstation, nor my Playstation 2, neither 3, nor 4 and I\u2019m pretty sure that even when\nthe Playstation 5 comes out and I eventually buy it, it will too\nfail to bring me joy. Even my work in Quantum Mechanics\nhas stopped bringing me joy. Even my afternoon pot noodle\ntastes like ashes in my mouth.\nOK that last part is a lie. I mean how can a pot of chicken\nand mushroom noodles taste like anything other than sweet\nsweet ambrosia?\nAs you might have noticed, I have a flare for the dramatic.\nBut the fact remains: nothing brings me joy anymore (except\npot noodles). What do I do?\nBest,\nBombay Bad Boy\nDear Bombay (if that\u2019s even your real name),\nYou\u2019ve listed a very particular set of things that\nbring you joy. Then again you are a physicist\nso what else can one expect.\nThe way I see it, your \u2018love\u2019 for pot noodles has\novershadowed every other pleasure in your\nlife. I\u2019d like you to try a mental experiment to\nassess whether your relationship with pot noodles is healthy or not. Whenever you have to\nmake a decision, for example choosing x over\ny, I want you to also throw into the mix option\npot noodle.\nFor example, let\u2019s say you\u2019re on a flight and\nthe flight attendant asks you whether you\u2019d like\nthe meat or the vegetarian option, I want you\nto mentally add the option pot noodle. Likewise if you\u2019re going to the cinema and your\nfriend asks you whether you\u2019d\u2019 like to watch\nHOROSCOPES\nArrival or Beauty and the Beast, you add the\nthird option pot noodle. Or in bed when your\npartner asks missionary or doggy style, I want\nyou to think \u2018but what about pot noodle?\u2019\nIf you find that you\u2019re always going for the pot\nnoodle option regardless of the scenario, you\nmight have a problem. Your only option might\nbe filling an inflatable pool with pot noodle\nand submerging yourself in it in an attempt\nto oversaturate your brain and get over your\nobsession with pot noodle.\nThis is my professional opinion as a florist.\nBig luv,\nChris xxxx\n\n"

Hopefully\nnot. But if you\nhave, maybe\nmake sure you\nare not infected with any\nof the near fatal diseases\nthat ticks sometimes carry.\nTicks, like mosquitoes can\nbe vectors of diseases like\nKyasanur Forest disease and\nthe more widely spread Lyme\ndisease which affects nearly\n3,00,000 people in USA and\n65,000 in Europe each year.\nApart from causing extreme\ndiscomfort in the form of\nitchiness that sometimes\nborders on agony, people\nsuffering from Lyme disease\nexperience severe muscle\naches, fatigue and high fever.\nHow is it that the bacterium\nBorrelia burgdorferi\nresponsible for Lyme disease\naffects humans to such a\nlarge extent, without harming\nthe ticks themselves? Scientists\nfrom University of Maryland\u2019s\nSchool of Medicine have\nnow found out how ticks\nmanage not to succumb to the\ninfection of the bacteria they\nso generously harbour.\nThough ticks appear\nsimilar to most insects, the\nfunctioning of their immune\nsystem has been found out\nto be very different. They\nseem to be missing the genes\nthat are pivotal in directing\nimmune response. Through\na process called RNA inter-ference, where RNA is used\nto obstruct the expression of\na gene, a gene named IMD\nwas identified that contains\nthe key codes required to\ntrigger an immune system\nresponse in mosquitoes. This\ngene was however missing\nin ticks. Several other crucial\ngenes were also found to\nbe missing. For example,\nPGRP, a crucial molecular\ncomponent required for\nimmune responses in mosqui-toes, helps identify invading\nmicrobes by the presence of\nsugar in their cell walls and\nthereby triggers the immune\nsystem response. Though this\nmolecular component was\nalso found to be present in\nticks, it did not seem to affect\nBorrelia burgdorferi in any\nway.\nThe pathways that link the\nimmune system, the IMD and\nPGRP are the same in both\nmosquitoes and ticks, however the mechanism in which\nthey work are entirely differ-ent. In mosquitoes and other\ninsects, the immune system\nresponses are triggered\non the detection of sugar\nmolecules in the cell wall of\nthe invading bacterium. But\nthe tick immune system is\ntriggered upon detection of\nfat molecules instead.\nFurther examination of\nBorrelia burgdorferi revealed\nthat it does not have a sugary\ncell wall that mosquitoes and\nother insects respond to, but\nthat it has one composed of\nfat molecules instead. Ticks,\ntherefore, appear to have an\nimmune system that is specifically adapted to handle\nthis. It is also believed that\nBorrelia burgdorferi may also\ncontain an anti-freeze protein\nthat helps ticks to thrive in\nfreezing temperatures.\nThe differences in the\nmechanisms and workings of the immune system\nbetween insects and ticks are\nan indication that the two\nevolved separately. Scientists\ntherefore believe that ticks\nand other insects have an\nevolutionary distance of\nnearly 500 million years, similar to that between humans\nand fish.\nIncrease in the deer population is believed to be the\nreason why more people\nare being infected by Lyme\nF\nact: Dogs can smell\ncancer.\nA charity called\n\u201cMedical Detection\nDogs\u201d is undertaking the first clinical\ntrial looking at using sniffer\ndogs to do something a little\nmore holistic than seeking\nout drugs and sausages at\nManchester Airport.\nThe procedure is simple \u2013\nwee in a pot, pooch gives it\na sniff and if they sit down\nyou have over a 90% chance\nof having prostate cancer.\nMen everywhere should be\nrejoicing: current detection\nof prostate cancers relies on\ntests with high false positive\nrates. This can lead to men\nundergoing unnecessary\nexploratory surgery (which\ncarries complication risks\nof erectile dysfunction and\nincontinence), but the use of\ndetection dogs as a second\nline of testing before surgery\ncould help to reduce the\ndamage caused by unneeded\nprocedures. It\u2019s not just for\nmen though \u2013 early reports\nsuggest that the dogs may\ndetect other types of cancers,\nincluding breast and lung.\nTheir secret is a highly\ntuned sense of smell (about\n100,000 times more sensitive\nthan humans). Cancer cells\nshow altered metabolism to\nnormal cells, and so produce\ndifferent waste products.\nThese waste products are\nthen released in the patient\u2019s\nurine, breath or blood and\ndogs can be trained to pick\nup their characteristic odour\nto help diagnose early and\nelusive cancers. Yet more\nproof that dogs > cats.\nAnother one of Mr. Aran\nShaunak\u2019s Little Bites of\nScience\nMan\u2019sBest\nFriend\n\\\\ Nearly 3,00,000\npeople in USA and\n65,000 in Europe\nare affected by\nLyme disease each\nyear \\\\\ndisease in the recent years.\nExtended periods of warm\nweather further help the ticks\nnot just to survive and persist,\nbut also to spread. Ticks are\nmost likely to catch the Borrelia \u2018bug\u2019 during their lymph\nstage from smaller animals\nlike rodents and birds which\nthey cling on to. As they grow\nbigger, they transfer onto\nlarger hosts like deer. The\ndeer however are not infected\nor affected by Borrelia\nburgdorferi, even though they\nplay hosts to the ticks.\nScientists are now exploring\nways in which the immune\nsystem of the ticks can\nbe tweaked in order to\nstrengthen it and make the\nticks less vulnerable to a bacterial invasion. They hope this\nhelps prevent transmission of\nbacterial infections like Lyme\ndisease from ticks to humans.\n\\\\ Tweaking the\ntick immune system\nto make them\nless vulnerable to\nbacterial invasions\ncan help reduce\nthe transmission of\ninfections like Lyme\ndisease from ticks to\nhumans \\\\\nIpsita Herlekar looks at how the immune system of ticks is adapted to host\ndisease causing bacteria without being affected themselves\n\\\\ Borrelia\nburgdorferi may\nalso contain an\nanti-freeze protein\nthat helps ticks to\nthrive in freezing\ntemperatures \\\\\n\n"

I was continuously getting\ncomments from random\n\\\\ For the first time\nin ages, I listened\nto my body. I ate\ntill satisfaction and\nI ate what I wanted\nwihout having to\nthink about the\n\"consequences\" \\\\\npeople about my body and in\nall honsesty, feeling objectified\nis quite disgusting.\nAfter the Christmas break\nof my second year and as\na new year\u2019s resolution, I\nmade the decision to get\nfit for once. I started doing\nweight training and tracking\nevery single bite of food that\nwent into my mouth. Was that\nthe solution to my problem?\nNope, that is when my eating\ndisorder properly started.\nI remember checking online\nhow many calories I was\nsupposed to eat a day and\nbelieved that just by following\nthat approach I would get\nmy dream body, I would feel\ngreat and happiness would\nimmediately appear in my life.\nI was definitely wrong.\nAt the beginning, I managed\nto follow a crazy diet while\nexcessively exercising but on\nthe third week I remember\nbeing completely starved. I felt\nquite disappointed at myself\nand thought I was just lacking\nwillpower. That weekend I\ndecided to have the famous\n'cheat meal' which turned into\na 'cheat weekend' and then\ninto binge eating.\nThis cycle of starvation\nMonday to Friday followed\nby binging on the weekends,\ncontinued happening all the\nway through my third year \u2013\nnot to forget the hours in the\ngym with a calorie-burning\nmentality.\nMy hair was falling out, I\nstopped having my period and\nthat \u2013 together with Imperial\u2019s\nworkload \u2013 made third year a\ncomplete nightmare. Another\nfactor that contributed to the\ndevelopment of my eating\ndisorder was the external\npressure I felt to look a certain\nway due to all the exercise I\nwas doing.\nOnce third year finished, I\ndecided to start dieting strictly\nfor the summer season while\nsimultaneously attending\ncounselling. I remember going\nto my counselling sessions and\nalways wondering how I got\nto that point \u2013 I used to be so\nhappy and full of energy all\nthe time.\nWe used to talk about my\ndegree, my friendships, my\nplans for the future and my\nfamily, but exercise and food\nwere topics that I barely\nmentioned even though they\nwere something that was\ntaking a lot of space in my life.\nOn the fourth session and after\na lot of thought I decided to\nbe open about my relationship\nwith food and the stress that\nthis was causing.\nAfter saying that out loud\nfor the first time, I felt like\nsomething finally clicked\nin me, I was ready to stop\nmaking food and exercise\ncontrolling mechanisms in my\nlife. I started searching online\nfor articles about binge eating\ndisorder, spent hours on\n\\\\ I remember going\nto my counselling\nsessions and\nwondering how I got\nto that point \\\\\nYoutube watching videos but I\nwas still quite confused. Some\nsaid binging was just a way\nto cope with emotions, others\nthat it was part of our survival\ninstinct.\nBy that time I was six weeks\nbinge-free, till that Sunday:\nanother binging episode. That\nupcoming week I was meeting\nthe counsellor again and that\nThursday was honestly one of\nthe most meaningful days of\nmy life. I realised in the session\nthat I forgot what being\nsatisfied and most importantly\nhaving a balanced life meant.\nI remember him mentioning\nthe expression 'intuitive\neating' and I felt completely\nscared about it. For me at\nthe time there was only black\nand white, moderation did not\nexist. Suddenly, I realised that\nmy problem was that I was not\neating enough.\nThe following morning when\nI woke up, for the first time in\nages, I listened to my body.\nI ate till satisfaction and I\nate what I wanted to have\nwithout thinking about the\n'consequences'. I remember\nhaving for breakfast some\nscrambled eggs on toast and\nan apple dipped in Nutella.\nSomething as simple as\nhaving Nutella without binging\nthe rest of the day or feeling\nguilty and embarrassed about\nit was a huge step for me, and\never since the 15th\nof August I\nhave been binge-free. I found\nthat being open about my\nunhealthy relationship with\nfood was the most important\nthing I did and even writing\nthis has been liberating and\nhelpful to remind myself how\nfar I have come.\nI can finally say that eating\nis not a stressful activity\nanymore, that I have found my\npassion for lifting again and\nthat I truly love myself and my\nbody \u2013 including every stretch\nmark and every bit of fat and\ncellulite.\n\\\\ I started tracking every\nsingle bite of food that went\ninto my mouth. That is when\nmy eating disorder properly\nstarted \\\\\n\n"

Over in\nthe women\u2019s race, Hamdorff\nhanded over to Amy Davila\nwho finished with an impressive 19.25.

It\u2019s kind of like\nsome BDSM relationship\nwhere feeling the pain is all\npart of the pleasure. Instead\nof a safe word, you bash your\nkeyboard and pull out your\nhair in frustration.\nSo what\u2019s the real issue?\nWhy isn\u2019t everyone enjoying\nO\nnce upon a\ntime, games\nused to be\nhard. Like\nreally, really\nfucking\nhard. You had to spend hours\ngrinding and levelling up,\nlooking for the right items or\nNPCs and learn the technique\nneeded to progress.\nBy comparison, the majority\nof games these days are relatively easy to play and get\ninto. Not much skill is required\nto play a game of Angry\nfun. However, in this large\nmarket of games, there are\nthose that retread the style of\nthe early games and are hard\nfor the sake of fun. Ask any\nnumber of veteran gamers\nfor a frustrating and difficult\ngame and you should be\nhearing the name Dark Souls\ncrop up several times.\nDark Souls has earned\nitself a reputation due to the\nnature of the gameplay. It\u2019s\na game where you can\u2019t just\nbutton mash, where you\u2019ll\ndie multiple times, not just\nbecause you don\u2019t know how\nto best the enemy but also\nbecause killing them depends\non you dying multiple times.\nBut dying is not forgiving, and\ndeath comes with the loss of a\nfew items from your inventory.\nDark Souls is a game where\nyou really need to learn the\nright combos and strategies\nand have incredible patience\nto make it through.\nSeveral other games aside\nfrom Dark Souls share this\ncomplex playstyle. Even a\ncute looking indie game like\nStory Meat Boy requires\npressing the keyboard at\nprecisely the right moment\n(easier said than done). Does\nthis difficulty spike diminish\nthe game\u2019s appeal? Far\nfrom it. Executing the right\ncommands, finally getting\nthrough an obstacle and\nadvancing to the next stage:\nthe awesomeness of dark\nsouls? It\u2019s because the kind\nof playstyle and techniques\nneeded to really enjoy these\nhard games just isn\u2019t compatible with most people, or even\ncasual gamers.\nI\u2019d love to invest over a\nhundred hours into a game,\nearn the best weapons and\nbuild the muscle memory to\nexecute the right combos.\nBut frankly, I have other shit\nI need to do. Looking after\nmyself, attempting to go to\nlectures as well as catching up\non anim\u00e9 or the latest marvel\nmovies. Sometimes people\nwant to relax and have fun,\nas opposed to be punished\nfor their incompetence, lack\nof cat-like reflexes as well\nas painstakingly earning\nachievements.\nAs hard and as tiresome as\nthese games may be, some\npeople are still able to play\nthem. And once you really\nget to experience their depth\nand precision, you realise that\nthey are damn awesome. The\nreason why so many people\nlove these games is because\nthey get better each time they\nplay them, so they\u2019ll progress\nfurther and further. Yeah,\nyou die a lot. But you\u2019ll know\nStressing out to chill out\nwhy you died, and you learn\nfrom that. And you\u2019ll improve.\nMaybe one day, when I have\nmore time on my hands, I can\nsee for myself what makes\nDark Souls so captivating for\nothers. Until then I\u2019ll bang my\nhead over problem sheets\nwhile daydreaming of the\ndays when I can bang my\nhead over the final boss fight.\n\\\\ Sometimes\npeople want to\nrelax and have fun,\nas opposed to be\npunished for their\nincompetence \\\\\nBirds for example. Given\nour limited leisure time, busy\nlifestyles and acknowledged\nlimitations, developers have\ndesigned games to be more\nuser-friendly and provide a\nquick and casual way to have\nOh No! That\u2019s like, the 37th\ntime I\u2019ve died! \\\\ Allan Rotgers\nPok\u00e9mon Go on a bike\n\\\\ As an adult, I\nhave managed to\ncombine these two\npassions \\\\\nspawning evolution objects\nat random, covering distance\nand hitting as many places as\npossible becomes the name\nof the game. So I got out my\nphone mount for my bike,\nand started hunting on my\ncommute. At first I was a bit\nwobbly, nearly swerving into\nparked cars as I threw my\nPok\u00e9 Balls or spun Pok\u00e9Stops,\nbut after a few minutes I\nD\no you remember\nthat blissful\nmoment in\nPok\u00e9mon Red\nwhen, after\nwalking around\nat a snail\u2019s pace for so\nlong, you could finally get\nyour bike in Cerulean City\nbike, whether it was when I\nwas immersed in my Game\nBoy, or actually outside in the\nreal world (where, thanks to\ngrowing up in the country,\na wild animal really did\noccasionally appear). Now,\nas an adult, I have managed\nto combine these two pas-sions, and finally, more than\nseven months after this was\nnothing more than an exciting\nconcept, I have perfected the\nPok\u00e9mon Go bicycle rig.\nI know that our esteemed\nGames Editor thinks Pok\u00e9mon\nGo is over (and is lacking a\nlot of the bits that made the\noriginal RPGs fun), but the\nGen 2 Pok\u00e9mon dropped\nlast week, bringing 80 new\nPok\u00e9mon and huge changes\n(OK, small additions) to the\nmechanics of the game (more\nberries and evolution items).\nAlong with the holiday events\nthat made everyone bored of\nnovelties like Pikachus wearing Christmas hats (but not six\nhour lures, they\u2019re still great),\nthis has caused a small resur-gence. Not enough to get\neveryone playing again, but\nit\u2019s stirred the completionists\nlike me \u2013 who sometimes likes\nto catch a few Pidgeys on the\nbus while hoping I\u2019ll run into\nthat Aerodactyl I\u2019m still missing \u2013 back into full catching\nmode.\nBack in July, I hunted a lot on\nmy bike, holding my phone in\none hand and steering with\nthe other, while cycling slow\nenough to hatch eggs along\nthe residential streets of West\nLondon. As well as getting\na very sore steering arm, I\nfell off (or more accurately,\nfell into stationary objects)\na couple of times before I\ngot the hang of it, but it did\nup my game. Now, with\na nearly full Pok\u00e9dex and\nthe existence of an actually\nfunctioning tracker, I can be\nmore selective about what\nI catch, and with Pok\u00e9stops\ncaught three Pikachus while\ncycling along Shepherd\u2019s\nBush Green without leaving\nthe middle lane of traffic\n(don\u2019t do that, it\u2019s stupid and\nyou will get hit by a truck and\nkilled). You don\u2019t get as much\ndistance as if you walk or\ntake the bus (a quarter of the\ndistance if you\u2019re lucky), you\u2019ll\nget to your destination slower\nthan if you cycle full pelt, but\nit is really very fun. Hunting\nPok\u00e9mon on a bike captures\nthe essence of the game,\nwhere you can excitedly dash\nbetween locations to get the\nPok\u00e9mon you need. There\u2019s\nnothing like the unbridled\njoy of finally hatching that\nTogepi while free-wheeling\ndown High Street Ken, and\ngetting all of the evolution\nsets for common Pok\u00e9mon is a\nbreeze.\nSafety warning: it is a huge\ndistraction when cycling, and\nyou need to keep your wits\nabout you. You need to be\nprepared to cycle past that\nTyranitar that spawned on\nHammersmith roundabout\nwhen you can\u2019t stop safely\n(you can always go back\nfor it!) or leave a Pok\u00e9mon\nhovering uncaught on your\nscreen for five minutes while\nyou navigate through a traffic\njam. On balance, I don\u2019t think\nit reduces your awareness\nmuch more than listening to\nmusic when you\u2019re cycling\n(no matter how leaky those\nearphones are, it\u2019s just not\nsafe), which I do not condone\nat all, but if you aren\u2019t very\nconfident in your ability to not\nget too sucked into the game\nthen you definitely shouldn\u2019t\ndo it at all.\nIf you do want to reignite\nyour love for Pok\u00e9mon\nGo, now is the time. Buy\na handlebar phone mount\n(they\u2019re only about a fiver on\nAmazon), and embrace your\ninner nine-year-old me, excitedly speeding down Route 17\npicking up all those delicious\nhidden items. But maybe don\u2019t\ndo it at rush hour, drivers in\nLondon are crazy.\n\\\\ There is nothing\nlike the unbridled joy\nof finally hatching\nthat Togepi while\nfreewheeling down\nHigh Street Ken \\\\\nand glide effortlessly down\nCycling Road to Fuchsia City\n(or indeed, to anywhere)?\nNo, you probably don\u2019t\nbecause now it\u2019s been a long\ntime and you were probably\nbarely born when they were\nreleased. Well, I do, because\nI was nine years old when\nthey came out (in the UK)\nand along with all the boys\nin my class, was immediately\nobsessed.\nFor me, there was almost\nno greater pleasure than\nwhizzing along the routes of\nKanto on my bike. Maybe it\nwas the jaunty MIDI keeping\nmy spirits up, or maybe it was\njust the increased efficiency\nof starting fights with Bikers,\nbut it was a wonderful time.\nAs a child I was always on a\nTessaDaveydetailsherthrilling\nand dangerous adventures of\nplaying Pok\u00e9mon Go while\nbiking through London\nTo catch a Pikachu \\\\ Jill Carlson\n\n"

From the rise of the far-right in Europe, to an American president trying to\nblock Muslims from entering the country, it\u2019s been a political atmosphere dominated by fear and hatred of others, and a\ncentralisation of voices that would previously be marginalised. Into this environment therefore, the success of Hidden\nFigures is something to be celebrated. Based on the true-life stories of the African-American women who calculated\nthe trajectories for NASA astronauts during the space race, Hidden Figures acts as a call for unity, reminding us that\nthe \u2018greatness\u2019 that Trump supporters want to bring America back to wasn\u2019t that great at all.\nTaraji P. Henson, Octavia Spencer, and Janelle Mona\u00e9 star in the film, which mainly centres around the \u2018computers\u2019 \u2013 groups of women who performed complex calculations at top speeds to help rockets get off the ground. The\nfilm highlights the vital importance these women played and the challenges they faced, in an era when high-tech\ncomputers were a distant vision. Henson plays Katherine Goble, whose skill with analytic geometry saw her calculating space flights, breaking down racial barriers placed in her way with a single-minded strength of will.\nHidden Figures is celebratory and unashamedly so; it is \u2018feel good\u2019 viewing at its most pure and wonderful. It celebrates the legacy of these black women, which has been largely unnoticed by historians, but also asks us to remember\nthat all individuals have worth; not just those who can help NASA. It\u2019s a lesson many leaders could learn, and the Academy would be sending out a strong message to the world by selecting a film that is so inherently political as Best Picture.\n...Manchester by the Sea\nW\nhich of these films will matter a year from now? What about five years? What about a decade? Too often,\nthe Academy has made the decision to give the Best Picture award to a film that, realistically, won\u2019t stand\nthe test of time. How many times have you watched Argo? What about The Artist? What about Crash?!\nIt\u2019s time that the Academy bucks the current trend, and goes for a winner that will really hold up down\nthe line. That winner is Kenneth Lonergan\u2019s Manchester by the Sea, a heart-breaking tale of loss and\ngrief, which eschews happy endings in favour of real drama.\nWhile the tale might seem simple on the surface \u2013 Casey Affleck plays Lee, a janitor who must return to his hometown after the death of his brother, to look after his teenage nephew \u2013 Lonergan\u2019s script and the excellent acting\nfrom the cast help plumb hidden depths. As the film unfolds, we begin to realise what Lee has been running from\nall these years and old emotional scars are reopened in violently emotional scenes. While Affleck does well with\nhis character \u2013 all downcast eyes and low voice \u2013 the real beating heart of the film can be found in Lucas Hedges\u2019\nperformance as Lee\u2019s nephew, whose adolescent angst plays off against Lee\u2019s repressed calm. Michelle Williams, simi-larly, puts on a barnstormer of a performance as Lee\u2019s estranged ex-wife.\nAt its heart, Manchester by the Sea is an emotional drama, comparable to works by Ibsen or Chekhov in its nuance\nand power. A reasonably simple story, well-told, with direction that gets the very best out of the actors: Manchester by\nthe Sea is a classic, and deserves to win the Best Picture award.\nW\nhat a year it is for Best Picture nominees. There really is something for everyone on the list this time\naround: family drama in Manchester By The Sea, Fences and Lion; sci-fi in Arrival; war drama in\nHacksaw Ridge; intelligent thriller Hell or High Water; and even a classic \u201cbased-on-a-true-story\u201d\nunsung heroes (or in this case, heroines) tale in Hidden Figures. It\u2019s one of the most all-round\nacclaimed collection of nominees in years \u2013 none of the films have an approval rating on Rotten\nTomatoes lower than 85% \u2013 but despite this there have only been two films dubbed to win at any\npoint in the process: Moonlight, which began picking up speed as a possible Oscar winner when it won the Golden Globe\nfor best drama earlier this year, and La La Land.\nI\u2019ll confess now; I haven\u2019t seen Moonlight, and I feel ashamed about it \u2013 not just because by all accounts it\u2019s one\nof the most moving portrayals of a man coming of age that has been put to the screen this decade, but because I\ncan\u2019t make a fully informed judgement about which film truly deserves the golden statue this year.\nBut I will say this: La La Land, frontrunner for the award from the get-go and darling of critics and crowds alike, has\nreceived all that hype for a reason. The main reason, aside from its cinematic beauty, the perfection of its direction and\nwriting, the power of its two central performances, and its utterly lush musical score: it is a film that dares to dream. In the era\nthat we\u2019re living in, where the entire world seems to have taken a turn towards the dark, it takes a hell of a lot of heart to make\na film this powerfully uplifting, that reminds all who watch it of the power of self-belief without miring itself in clich\u00e9.\nLa La Land...\nIndira Mallik\nTom Stephens\nFred Fyles \\\\ Allstar\n\\\\ Allstar\n\\\\ 20th\nCentury Fox\nMoonlight...\nE\nvery so often a film comes along on the big screen and,\nfor a brief moment, thaws out the iciness of our hearts,\nreminding us of what it means to be human \u2013 profoundly\nvulnerable and emotional \u2013 before we return to our\nseemingly robust and apathetic fa\u00e7ade. Moonlight happens\nto be such a film. The centrepiece of this cinematic triptych\nis Chiron, a boy whom we all know from school \u2013 that boy who was\ncalled \u2018faggot\u2019 before he even understood what it meant.\nSome of us may have had to endure the unfortunate affair of\nbeing mercilessly bullied, taunted, and humiliated while growing up\nfor being born a certain way, and the lucky ones are blessed with\nabundant care and love from people they can depend upon, enabling\nthem to bounce back up relatively unscarred. But that isn\u2019t the case\nfor young Chiron, who lives in an impoverished neighbourhood and\nwhose mother is a drug addict. Recovering from such a terrible ordeal\nis akin to finding the way out of a tunnel without a flashlight \u2013 it seems\nhopeless. But the ending of Moonlight suggests that he has found\nhope and has attained his yearning for love, with a concluding scene\nopen to interpretation if one isn\u2019t optimistic enough \u2013 and it\u2019s hard to\nbe optimistic in the current climate.\nIt is refreshing to watch a film portray a black man as a quiet, sensitive protagonist as opposed to the aggressive criminal stereotype\nall-too-often used in mainstream Hollywood films. Moonlight, in its\nentirety, is a film about love and its capacity to alleviate painful past\nexperiences \u2013 and that is something we can all relate to, regardless of\nour differences.\n\\\\ Alamay\nA selection of our writers let us know which film they think should take home the top prize of Best\nPicture at this Sunday\u2019s Academy Awards Ceremony\nAnd the Best Picture Award goes to...\nHafiz Zainal\n...Arrival\n\\\\ Paramount Pictures\nW\nith Arrival, Denis Villeneuve has turned a tedious\nand uninteresting topic \u2013 the translation of an alien\nlanguage \u2013 into science-fiction spectacle. From its\nmeticulous sound design to its subdued lighting,\nthe whole film looks and sounds otherworldly.\nCinematographer Bradford Young showcases his\ntalent, with sweeping shots of rolling clouds and the cavernous inside of an\nalien spaceship, while J\u00f3hann J\u00f3hannsson\u2019s score is filled with strange and\nerratic noise, complementing the harsh clicking of the heptapods\u2019 speech.\nOf this year\u2019s Best Picture nominations it is easily the most technically\nimpressive (despite picking up less nominations in technical categories than\nLa La Land), and even with its interesting alien \u2018antagonists\u2019 it feels far more\nrooted in reality compared to most modern science-fiction.\nReflecting on how language shapes our world and interactions, the film\u2019s\nprotagonist Dr. Banks (Amy Adams) asserts that \u201clanguage is the foundation of civilization. It is the glue that holds a people together. It is the first\nweapon drawn in a conflict.\u201d The unfamiliar language of the heptapods\nreplaces the wonder and excitement usually provided by explosive alien\nweapons; the creatures emit an ink-like substance which flows through\nthe air \u2018spelling\u2019 out calligraphic-style messages which Dr. Banks and Ian\nDonnelly (Jeremy Renner) , a mathematician, must decipher. Amy Adams\u2019\nperformance as Dr. Banks, the foremost expert in her field, is equally\nimpressive: we see her struggle with her past as she tries to save the\nplanet from destroying itself, and international rivalries escalate. Arrival\u2019s\npromotion of communication over conflict, and cooperation over military\nintervention, is timely given the world in which we currently find ourselves.\nCale Tilford\n\n"

An eclectic array\nof children\u2019s toys, many of\nwhich you\u2019ll recall fondly,\nis on display. And although\n\u2018display\u2019 is ostensibly the right\nword, many of the items in\nthe space are not just meant\nto be looked at, but to be\npicked up and played with,\nenjoyed in precisely the way\nthey were originally intended.\nThere\u2019s no ironic element\nintended; this exhibition is\nto be enjoyed simply and\nsincerely. There is a cardboard box tunnel/fort, but\nnot just any; the epic kind that\nyour six-year-old self would\nhave dreamed of building.\nThere\u2019s a ball pit, and a\ngigantic crayon doodle on\nthe floor. Slightly disjointed\nwith the rest of the display,\nbut nonetheless effective, is\na collection of hanging guns,\ncrafted from plastic bottles\nand other domestic items.\nTheir silhouettes are cast on\nthe wall opposite, creating an\ninteresting illusion. Smattering the walls is a selection\nof tasteful, and sometimes\nthought-provoking, imagery\ncontributed by PhotoSoc.\nI heard one guy announce\nthat he didn\u2019t \u2018get it\u2019, which\nhighlighted for me the fact\nthat this is not the form of art\nyou will find in the Tate or\nTate Modern, for example:\nunlike other exhibitions, that\ntry their hardest to appear\nproper and fit expectations,\nthis one isn\u2019t trying to imitate\nthe archetypal Art Gallery.\nThis is its greatest strength.\nIt\u2019s not about standing for\nten minutes, reverent and\nsolemn, while you try and\nunravel some impenetrable\nmonstrosity made by an artist\nwho cares more about being\navant-garde than making\nsomething you\u2019ll be able to\nappreciate. In fact, reverent\nand solemn are two words\nthat have nothing to do with\nthis exhibition. The joy that\nit contains is immediately\napparent, and there is no\nneed to think too hard about\nwhat any deeper, darker\nmeaning could be.\nMore interesting than the\nspace was doodled upon\nwith great velocity and aban-don. There was face painting.\nNo one appeared to embody\nthe spirit of the exhibition as\nmuch as LeoSoc committee\nmember Jack Campbell, who,\nwearing an animal onesie,\njuice box in one hand, crayon\nin the other \u2013 but somehow\nwith dignity \u2013 strolled around\nthe place, just enjoying the\nwhole thing.\nThe evening was punctuated\nwith bursting balloons which,\nlike at a childhood birthday\nparty, are an unavoidable\nside-effect, one that strangely\nbrought the whole room\ntogether for a moment in\nshocked gasps, while we figured out that none of us had\nin fact died. It only reinforced\nthe best qualities of this\nunique exhibition: inclusivity,\nauthenticity, and fun. Those\nqualities LeoSoc Dev Sec\nSophie Inman imbued so\neffortlessly into this defiantly\ncheerful installation, behind\nwhich she was the creative\nand organisational driving\nforce.\nThe \u2018Confused Nursery\u2019\nruns until 23rd\nFebruary, free\nof charge, and is in the Blyth\nGallery, level 5 Sherfield\nbuilding.\n\\\\ I heard one guy\nannounce that he\ndidn\u2019t \u2018get it\u2019, which\nhighlighted for me\nthe fact that this is\nnot the form of art\nyou will find in the\nTate or Tate Modern\n\\\\\nexhibition in and of itself\nwas how it came alive on\nthe opening night: wine and\nsnacks were laid out, which\nfor a typical Blyth exhibition\nis intended to provide a\nsense of sophistication and\ndecorum. But the exciting\natmosphere of the room\nswiftly did away with formal-ity, and within minutes shoes\ncame off and people could\nbe seen crawling like toddlers\nas they disappeared and\nemerged at various points\nin the tunnel.

Were there difficulties\nprogramming the sweet potato\nfries into the new tills? Have\nthere been significant training\ncosts to prepare staff for the\nonslaught of sweet potato fry\norders? How are kitchen staff\ncoping with trying to balance\nthree types of fries?\nJohnston tells us everything\nis fine and that the tills are\nbeing reprogrammed and fine\ntuned constantly anyway. She\ndid point out the existence of\nthe new pulled pork pizza\nthough. \u201cApparently it\u2019s not\nvery nice. I watched someone\neat it and they were not\nenjoying it.\u201d Good to know.\nT\nhe Union has\nlaunched a new\nmenu and is now\na proud server\nof sweet potato\nfries. The new dish\nis another addition to the\nUnion\u2019s growing vegetarian\nand vegan options in support\nof Go Green Week (yes, sweet\npotato fries are vegan, we\nasked).\nA side of dem sweet potato\nfries will set you back \u00a32.50,\n70p more than student\nfavourite curly fries and 20p\nmore than curly fries WITH\ncheese. But is it worth it?\n\u201cThey\u2019re so good\u2026\u201d, says\nvegan Francesca Aras, \u201cbut\nthey\u2019re so expensive.\u201d\nWe sent in a felix reporter\nto evaluate the new menu\naddition. We selected Theresa\nDavey, who\u2019s been at Imperial\nfor almost a decade and\nknows what\u2019s up. \u201cI\u2019m super\nbasic, so obviously if sweet\npotato fries are an option, I\nhave to have them. I haven\u2019t\neven tried them yet, but I just\nknow they\u2019re going to be even\nbetter than the curly fries!\u201d\nUpon entering FiveSixEight\nand looking at the menu,\nDavey spots the sweet potato\nfries and the pricing. \u201cThey\u2019re\nslightly more expensive than\ncurly fries with cheese so I\u2019d\nexpect them to be better than\nthe staple option\u201d Davey says.\n\u201cOn the other hand the price\ndoesn\u2019t seem to be deterring\nanyone because everyone is\nordering them.\u201d\nBut let\u2019s talk fries.\n\u201cThey were hot and crispy\nwhich is pleasant. Sweet\npotato was well cooked\nthroughout. Good consistent\nlayer of batter on all fries.\nThey definitely need salt\nthough. They\u2019re very bland.\u201d\nJust like the sweet potato\nfries, this review should also\nbe taken with a pinch of salt,\nas Davey is not a food critic\nand we\u2019ve been informed that\nthe sweet potato fries aren\u2019t\nactually fried in batter.\n\u201cThey\u2019re almost nicer when\nthey\u2019ve cooled down a bit and\nthe batter has solidified into\na separable layer.\u201d To each\ntheir own.\nWhat does the staff think\nof the new fries though? We\ntalked to Sophie Johnston.\n\u201cThey\u2019re pretty good, but\npretty expensive\u201d says\nJohnston. \u201cI feel like we\u2019re\ntrying to be too fancy. We\u2019re\nnot h-bar, we\u2019re not a gastropub.\u201d Fact.\nBut what about logistical\n\\\\ I feel like we\u2019re\ntrying to be too\nfancy.

Since then, several\nmembers of the Green Party\nhave written to King\u2019s to show\ntheir support for the students.\nAfter hearing about the\nprotests online, Si\u00e2n Berry\nAM, a London Assembly\nMember for the Green Party,\nwas approached on Facebook\nby one of the students involved.\nIn response to our email\ninquiry, Ms Berry said she\nhad been \u201cmore than happy\nto do something\u201d and wrote\nto Professor Edward Byrne\nAC, the current President and\nPrincipal of King\u2019s. The letter\n(which was also posted on\nsocialmedia)wasco-signedby\nelected Green Party members\nCaroline Russell AM (and\nIslington Councillor), Jean\nLambert MEP, and Councillor\nScott Ainslie. It is hardly\nsurprising that the Greens\nsupport divestment, which Ms\nBerry has advocated for in her\ncapacity as both Assembly\nMember and Councillor for\nCamden.\nThe letter begins by\nsuggesting the students\ninvolved in the protest merely\nwanted a \u201cproper discussion\u201d\nregarding the future of fossil\nfuels at KCL and that calling the\npolice was a \u201cvery unusual\u201d\nstep. The letter goes on to\nexplain that divesting from\nJoanna Wormald\nHopefully students won\u2019t be put off by the higher cost \\\\ ICU\nfossil fuels (a move reportedly\nsupported by 96% of KCL\nstudents) would not only help\nto reduce climate change, but\ncould be financially beneficial\nfor the university as well.\nReferring to previous\nexamples of divestment, the\nletter explains that fossil fuels\nare fast becoming stranded\nassets and investing in\ncompanies reliant on their use\nis increasingly risky. Ms Berry\ntold us that she thought it was\na good idea to put forward\nthe financial case because this\nissue is \u201cnot just about ethics\nbut investing in things that\nactually have a future, such\nas renewable energy, rather\nthan fossil fuels\u201d.\nThe letter concludes by\nurging KCL to reconsider their\nactions against the students,\nimploring them to talk to the\ncampaigners rather than\npunishing them for their part\nin an \u201centirely non-violent and\npeaceful protest\u201d on an issue\n\u201cof great concern to us all\u201d.\nKing\u2019s has not yet issued\na response but Ms Berry is\nhopeful that they will pursue a\ndialoguewiththecampaigners\nrather than imposing these\n\u201charsh sanctions\u201d. Academic\ncareers may depend on it.\n\\\\ This is not just\nabout ethics but\ninvesting in things\nthat actually have a\nfuture \\\\\n\\\\ Just like the sweet\npotato fries, this\nreview should also\nbe taken with a\npinch of salt \\\\\nstaff.\u201d\nWhat if you\u2019re only a casual\nsmoker that just partakes in a\nlittle bit of chain smoking after\nyou\u2019ve had a few? Fear not,\nas smoking will be permitted\nin Beit Quad on Wednesday\nand Friday evenings during\nterm-time when you have to\npay to get in.\nImperial\u2019s smoking ban has\nbeen branded as an attempt\nto fulfil its \u201dduty of care\nto staff and students\u201d. The\ndriver behind the ban is the\nrecognition of smoking (and\nits passive counterpart) as the\nImperial to go smoke-free*\n*Some exceptions apply\nLef Apostolakis\nI\nt\u2019s official: Imperial will\nimplement a smoking ban\non all College campuses\nand properties starting\nthe 1st\nof August.\nThe move which has\nbeen in the making for quite\nsome time now, is a result of\nvarious lengthy consultations\nincluding a \u2018referendum\u2019 that\ntook place earlier last term.\nThe referendum was meant\nto gauge the feelings of the\nstudent body and asked the\nquestion \u201cShould smoking\nbe allowed on campus?\u201d A\ntotal of 748 students (or 4.5%\nof the student population)\nparticipated, with 219 voting\n\u201cYes\u201d, 421 students voting\n\u201cNo\u201d and a further 108 voting\n\u201cNo, except for Beit Quad\u201d\nThe referendum results were\ntaken to a College Working\nGroup, which has been\ndiscussing the issue since\nJanuary 2016.\nThe Working Group\u2019s\ndecision was finalised and\nmade public earlier this positions\u201d. If confronted with\n\\\\ The driver\nbehind the ban is\nthe recognition of\nsmoking (and its\npassive counterpart)\nas the leading\npreventable cause of\ndisease and death in\nthe UK \\\\\nweek, with an announcement\ndeclaring that starting\nnext August, \u201call Imperial\ncampuses and properties will\nbe smoke-free. This means that\nsmoking by staff and students\nwill not be permitted on or\nwithin 20 metres of College\nland.\u201d\nThe ban is expected to be\nimplemented through the\ncooperation of staff and\nstudents \u201cbut particularly\nstaff in management\nindividuals who refuse to\ntake their smoking elsewhere,\nImperial students and staff\nare encouraged to contact\nCollege. It is unclear what\nthe role of security will be in\nmonitoring smoking not only\non campus, but especially\noff campus, given that the\nSouth Kensington campus\nneighbours extremely busy\npublic venues such as The\nRoyal Albert Hall and the\nScience Museum. A college\nspokesperson however did tell\nfelix \u201cit will not be principally\nthe responsibility of security\nleading preventable cause of\ndisease and death in the UK.\nAlthough vaping is already\nprohibited inside College\nbuildings, a gap in health and\ntobacco related legislation\nmeans vaping is not included\nin the ban, and students and\nstaff will be allowed to vape\non College Land as long as it\ndoes not break existing rules.\nWith Imperial trying to fulfil\nits \u201dduty of care to staff and\nstudents\u201d the question arises,\nwhat about its duty to society?\nA felix investigation last year\n(Issue 1636) uncovered that\n\u00a32.3 million was invested\ninto tobacco companies via\nintermediate funds, which is\nin direct contradiction with the\nsmoking ban and \u201cbenefit of\nsociety\u201d sentiment prevalent\nin the institution\u2019s mission\nstatement.\nIt remains unlikely that we\nwill soon see a divestment\nfrom the tobacco industry in\nconjunction to the smoking\nban.\nSmoking may be banned but vaping isn\u2019t (sort of) \\\\ Vaping360\nEating Disorder Awareness Week hits IC\nLef Apostolakis\nlobby for better services.\nFor Cramphorn this campaign is particularly special \u201cI\nwas diagnosed with anorexia\nnervosa when I was eleven\nand repeatedly refused entry into specialist services because I wasn\u2019t \u2018thin\u2019 enough.\u201d\nshe says. \u201cI\u2019ve been hospitalised five times and nearly lost\nmy life as a consequence of\ninadequate services.

The characters\nare expressive: Macbeth\n(Nana Amoo-Gottfried)\ndelivers animated soliloquies,\nwhich were fairly terrifying;\nLady Macbeth (Madeline\nAppiah) is as tragic as you\ncould hope for \u2013 the cold\nghosts of her terrible deeds\nhaunting the Dorfman Theatre as she attempts to wash\na perennial smear of\nnon-existent blood\noff her hands as\nshe stares blankly\nthrough the\naudience,\npupils the size\nof pinholes.\nFrom the\noff, there\nwas the\nimmediate\nevocation\nof a tribal\natmosphere.\nA thunder-ous, rhythmic\npercussion complements much\nof the action, with\nwar drums banging in\na regular rhythm: sound\nis evidently a major part of\nthis performance \u2013 a part of\nthe attempt, it seems, to keep\nyounger viewers of the play\ninterested \u2013 and it seems\nto work. Actors in ragged\nclothes run round chanting\nand bashing sticks together,\nwith the odd haunting\nGaelic chant giving a nod\nto the play\u2019s original Scottish\nsetting.\nWhat I found particularly\nodd, were the strange\nanachronisms that introduced\nthemselves now and again\n\u2013 notably Macbeth dons a\nWW1-era gas-mask at several points. While my initial\nthoughts were that they were\nshort on props, it became\nclear that this was a deliberate theme, with jerry cans\nand metal flasks popping up\neverywhere. It was refreshing\nto see Macbeth performed in\nsuch a different way, but I felt\nthe mix of tribe-like culture\nand post-apocalyptic society\nwere too much with too little\nexplanation and were potentially confusing.\nAlthough the fast pace of\nthe play, combined with the\narchaic language, did make it\nslightly difficult to understand\nthe finer points at times, this\nwas compensated for by\nother methods of exposition:\nthere is much movement in\nthe play, and many thrilling\nWaleed El-Geresy\nMacbeth was on at the\nNational Theatre from the 6th\n\u2013 20th\nFebruary\nMacbeth \\\\ National Theatre\nfight scenes to keep the\nstory moving, all different\nin their own way \u2013 eerie\nnecromancy being practiced\nin one mad scrum turns into\na rough knife-fight to the\ndeath in the next. Despite\nan arguably docile scene at\nthe end, where a gas mask is\nraised into the air in triumph,\nas opposed to a real head,\nin general they don\u2019t skimp\non the gruesome details: in\none particularly horrifying\nmoment Lady Macbeth\u2019s\nthroat is slit in a frankly horrifying display which would\nsatisfy the hunger for gore of\nthe greediest viewers.\nIt seems as though Audibert\nwished the characters to stay\ntrue to much of the original\ndialogue \u2013 Shakespearean\nlanguage is, of course, part\nof the experience \u2013 with the\noccasional addition, and\nfrequent omission to cut\nthe performance to a more\nmanageable length, allowing\nfor scenes to focus on other\naspects such as physical\nmovement. The abridgement\nof the script was done well:\nthe story didn\u2019t really feel\nas if it was missing anything\nand flowed throughout. Most\nimportantly, the production\naccomplished its goal of\nadapting Macbeth to enthuse\nyounger audiences about\nthe works of the literary\nbehemoth, whose plays are\noften unfairly stereotyped\nas difficult or outdated. The\ncreative way in which the\nstory of Macbeth was\ntold throws a new\nlight on Shakespeare and begs\nthe question of\nwhy \u2013 given the\nsuccess of a TV\nshow like Game\nof Thrones,\nwhich is similar\nin terms of\nthe combination of kingly\npower-struggles,\nviolence, and\nbetrayal \u2013 tales\nlike Macbeth don\u2019t\nhave just as much of\na passionate following\namong the youth of\ntoday. Perhaps the old tales\nsimply need new voices.\nMadeline Appiah in rehearsal as Lady\nMacbeth \\\\ Ellie Kurtz\nT\nhomas Ostermeier\u2019s\nproduction of\nRichard III is a\ncelebration of the\nwicked, the tragic,\nand the profane.\nThe play is on tour from\nSchaub\u00fchne Berlin and is\nperformed entirely in German\nwith English surtitles on the\nstage.\nNot only is this a departure\nfrom the original Shakespeare in terms of language,\nbut also in setting and style.\nThanks to a soundtrack of\nloud industrial music, a live\non-stage drummer, pyrotech-nics, and shouted German,\nthe play at times feels like\na concert by heavy-metal\nband Rammstein. Fittingly\nRichard is portrayed by\nLars Eidinger \u2013 a renowned\nGerman theatre and television actor \u2013 like a depraved\nrock star. This portrayal is\nno doubt greatly influenced\nby Rammstein\u2019s frontman\nTill Lindemann... Edinger\nflourishes in a role where he\ncan be lewd and shocking:\nhis comedy is deeply cynical,\nand he delights in breaking\nthe fourth wall. At one point\nHe is a hunchback with a\ndeformed foot, deeply bitter\nand cynical: \u201cI am determined to prove a villain /\nAnd hate the idle pleasures of\nthese days\u201d.

The setting is\nself-consciously anachronistic,\nthe opening scene begins\nwith the cast in tuxedos\nand designer dresses as the\nroyalty sip from champagne\nflutes. This works well \u2013 Richard III is full of references to\nthe debauchery of the house\nof York, at a time when leisure meant banquets, masked\nballs, and waltzing. Making\nthis apparent to a modern\naudience means updating\ncostumes, locations, and\nreferences.\nRichard III\u2019s corpse was\nidentified and exhumed\nfrom a city council car park\nin Leicester, by a team of\narchaeologists and scientists\nat Leicester University in 2012\nwho then restored the remains\nto Leicester Cathedral. He\nwas the last English monarch\nto be killed in battle and his\ndeath marked the end of the\nhouse Plantagenet and rise of\nthe Tudors. Over generations\nhis physical whereabouts may\nhave been forgotten, but his\ncharacter was not, and thanks\nto Shakespeare\u2019s pro-Tu-dor agenda he has been\n\\\\ For all its\nabsurdity,\nSchaub\u00fchne Berlin\u2019s\nproduction touches\nthe heart of Richard\nIII\u2019s character \u2013 a\nshocking depiction\nof the face of\ntyranny \\\\\nimmortalised as a monster in\nEnglish culture.\nWhether his infamy is\ndeserved or not is still an\narea of debate. Either way,\nRichard III is not a great play\ndue to its historical accuracy,\nbut instead because it tells a\ntimeless story of the creation\nof an anti-hero through the\npolitics of rejection. For all its\nabsurdity, Schaub\u00fchne Berlin\u2019s production touches the\nheart of Richard III\u2019s character \u2013 it is a shocking depiction\nof the face of tyranny at such\nan apposite moment in global\npolitics.\nRichard III\n| The Bard\ngiven Teutonic\novertones\n\\\\ The production\ndoes not\nsurrender any of\nits idiosyncrasy to\nthe English theatre\ntradition, and retains\nthe clear marks of\nGerman absurdity \\\\\nin the penultimate scene, a\nbeeping noise disrupts Lars\nin mid-speech and he stands,\non top of a table in his crown\ndemanding that the audience\nidentify and stop this sound\nas he will only continue when\nit has disappeared. The show\nis filled with similar interrup-tions, such as Edinger reading\naloud the English surtitles,\ninterrogating members of\nthe audience going to the\nbathroom, or at one point\nrapping the script out loud to\nrock music.\nDespite these alterations the\ninner character of Richard\nis kept close to the original.\n\\\\ The progression\nof Richard from\nanti-hero, whose\nactions appall but\nwhose rhetoric\nenamours, to pure\nvillain is eloquently\nportrayed \\\\\nmarry Warwick's youngest\ndaughter. What, though I\nkill'd her husband and her\nfather?\u201d \u2013 Edinger is certainly\nthe right casting choice to\ncarry these traits forward.\nThe progression of Richard\nfrom anti-hero, whose actions\nappal but whose rhetoric\nenamours, to pure villain is\neloquently portrayed. By the\ntime the two princes have\nbeen murdered in the tower\nwe very much empathise with\nQueen Elizabeth and Margaret, despite earlier their being\nthe butt of Richard\u2019s jokes and\nscorn. One striking alteration\nis that the battle at the end is\nreplaced by a short physical\nmonologue where Richard\nis murdered and suspended\nprecariously from the theatre\nceiling by his foot.\nThe production does not\nsurrender any of its idiosyncrasy to the English theatre\ntradition, and retains the clear\nmarks of German absurd-ity: Richard strips nude and\nremoves his hunchback and\nclub-foot when courting Lady\nAnne; similarly the murder\nof Clarence is made darkly\nhumorous but also excessively\ngory, and the effect is one\nof cognitive dissonance \u2013\nmost of the audience don\u2019t\n\n"

Thankfully Jamell Samuels and Le Osikomaiya have\nlinked up for the 2nd Annual NeighbourHOOD Grammys 2017, bringing through two\nnew bruddas onto the committee: Andy Djaba and Jamill Wallace. Last year was mad for\nHip-Hop with many of the biggest names producing phenomenal work, its only right we\nacknowledge those who are really out here for the culture. The Grammys tried to play us,\nbut they played themselves, so we\u2019re about to tell you what was really played on the streets\nand recognise the mandem that have held it down and done bits.\nNeighbourHOOD Grammys 2017\nAlbum of the year\nThe Life of Pablo, Kanye West [aka Yeezus] \u201cWe on an Ultralight Beam\u2026 This is a God dream\u2026 This is everything.\u201d\nDespite the unprecedented commercial success of Views, the committee came to the decision that Drizzy simply has to\ncome harder than he did on this album to be deserving of Album of the Year. Travis and Schoolboy both came through\nwith impressive sophomore efforts and both albums have very few skippable tracks. The committee was in agreement\nthat 4 Your Eyez Only was stunning, however its brevity, although leaving fans wanting more, actually worked against\nit in this case (the whole album is only 45 minutes long). The Life of Pablo saw Kanye return to his crazy, experimental and creative best. The heavy gospel influences throughout the album are apparent, with the hauntingly beautiful\nUltralight Beam a particular committee favourite. It\u2019s safe to say this is one of Kanye\u2019s best bodies of work to date.\nNominations | Views, Drake [aka Drizzy, Champange Papi, 6ixGOD] | Birds in the Trap Sing McKnight, Travis\nScott [aka La Flame] | 4 Your Eyez Only, J. Cole | Blank Face LP, ScHoolboy Q [aka Quincy, Groovy Tony]\nHonourable shoutouts | The Sun\u2019s Tirade, Isaiah Rashad [aka Zaywob] | The Divine Feminine, Mac Miller\nThe Divine Feminine has to be the best rap love album of all time, hands down. Dude used 10 tracks to speak about\none woman. If Mac Miller\u2019s grandma don\u2019t move your heart, you cold.\nSong of the year\nPick Up the Phone ft. Quavo [Young Thug & Travis Scott, Jeffery & Birds in the Trap Sing McKnight]\nDespite Drake\u2019s undeniable success for Kyla\u2019s Do You Mind, the committee agreed that the lack of originality meant it could not be\ncrowned the winner. Kanye West\u2019s soulful use of T. L. Barrett\u2019s gospel track also named Father Stretch My Hands is another gem off\nthe album. The Metro Boomin production merges almost perfectly with the voices of Ye, his former pupil Kid Cudi and the backing\nchoir. A latecomer to the 2016 party, Bad & Boujee could easily be called the song of a generation. The term \u2018Boujee\u2019 comes\nfrom the word \u2018bourgeois\u2019 used to describe the middle class; but to be honest, nobody could care less because the track is flames.\nName another song to get a shout-out at the Golden Globes! Panda is simply an undeniable hit. You hear the song and you can\u2019t\nhelp but get excited. It has been heard everywhere from fashion shows to the grimiest shubs. However, all these come second\nto Pick Up the Phone. The tropical vibes and melodic tones from Thugger Thugger and La Flame make the song irresistible. It has\nsomething for everyone and Quavo brings one of the best verses of his life to seal the win.\nNominations | One Dance [Drake, Views] | Father Stretch My Hands Pt. 1 [Kanye West, Life of Pablo] | Bad & Boujee [Migos,\nSingle] | Panda [Desiigner, New English]\nHonorable shoutouts | Ultralight Beam [Kanye West, Life of Pablo] | Nas Album Done [DJ Khaled, Major Key] |\nNas goes in with one of the most fire verses of the year, with a powerful message to go alongside it. All just to remind us that his album\nis done and that we should be looking out for it. If his album is anything like this track it\u2019s definitely on our most anticipated list.\nMixtape of the year\nColouring Book, Chance the Rapper [aka Lil Chano from 79th] \u201cAm I the only nigga still care about mixtapes?\u201d\nAfter taking one of the biggest Ls in recent rap history in his beef with Drake, Meek Mill\u2019s career was hanging in the balance this\nyear. DC4 served as a reminder that he is still capable of producing some pure heat. Slime Season 3, the highly anticipated third\nand final instalment of Young Thug\u2019s Slime Season projects provided us with near perfect hype music. Noname impressively came\nthrough with a very outstanding debut mixtape in Telefone, displaying her melodic raps and \u2018happy go luckily\u2019 musical style with\na full body of work. On Project E.T., DJ Esco and Future linked up to do what they do best, releasing yet another fire mixtape.\nColouring Book is a blend of gospel and hip-hop; all credit is given to Lil Chano for creating such a consistent and concise piece of\nwork.\nNominations | DC4, Meek Mill [aka Meek Milly] Slime Season 3, Young Thug [aka Thugger Thugger, Young Slime, YSL Lord, Jeffery] | Telefone, Noname | Project E.T, DJ Esco\nHonorable shoutouts | Purple Reign, Future [aka Future Hendrix, Plato, Astronaut Kid]\n/\n/\nA\nt\nl\na\nn\nt\ni\nc\nR\ne\nc\no\nr\nd\ns\n/\n/\n/\n/\nB\nl\ne\na\nc\nh\ne\nr\nReport//\n/\n/\nC\no\nl\nu\nm\nb\ni\na\nR\ne\nc\no\nr\nd\ni\nn\ng\ns\n/\n/\nBest featured verse\nChance the Rapper - Ultralight Beam [Kanye West, Life of Pablo] \u201cI made Sunday Candy, I\u2019m never going to hell\u201d\nAs usual, Kendrick came in with the fire feature verses. His verse on Goosebumps deserves a special mention for his unexpected falsetto\nbars- nobody else in the game is brave enough or versatile enough to even attempt this. Quavo\u2019s verse just reminds us all that we will\nnever have as much sauce as him - the man is just effortlessly cool. Jay Electronica stole the show with his verse, dropping arguably\nthe best verse on Chance\u2019s whole album. Chance uses the gospel backdrop, to give listeners a personal insight into his relationship\nwith God in the standout verse of the album. Fault is almost impossible to find in what he crafted.\nNominations | Quavo - Pick Up the Phone [Young Thug & Travis Scott, Jeffery & Birds in the Trap Sing McKnight] | Kendrick LamarGoosebumps [Travis Scott, Birds in the Trap Sing McKnight] | Kendrick Lamar - Wat\u2019s Wrong [ Isaiah Rashad, The Sun\u2019s Tirade] | Jay\nElectronica - How Great [Chance the Rapper, Colouring Book]\nHonourable shoutouts | Kanye West - Pop Style [Drake, Single] Kanye\u2019s verse needs this shoutout because it was flames to the point at\nwhich Drake removed him from the track | J. Cole - Jermaine\u2019s Interlude [DJ Khaled, Major Key]\nThe committee came to an agreement that essentially this track was essentially a J. Cole \u2018song\u2019 therefore couldn\u2019t count as a featured\nverse since no one else was on it..\nLyricist of the year\nChance the Rapper \u201cBruh, I\u2019m at your head like Craig did Deebo\u201d\nOne thing that the Drake vs. Meek Mill beef showed us is that, more than for any other genre, in hip-hop, an artist\u2019s\ncredibility and legacy is ultimately dependent on the strength of their pen. Lyrical ability can make or break an\nartist in this game and perhaps this is why Drake came so hard at Meek after the ghostwriting allegations. We\nincluded this category to acknowledge the artists with the kind of bars that force listeners to stop and really\nthink. Not traditionally known for his lyrical ability, Chance elevated his game this year and his verse on Ultralight Beam alone is enough to make him deserving of this category.\nNominations | Mick Jenkins, Isaiah Rashad, Ab Soul, Mac Miller\nHonourable shoutouts | Meek Mill, Kendrick Lamar\nBest UK album\nKonnichiwa, Skepta\nWe had to include this category to recognise the work that the homegrown UK mandem have been putting in.\nThe grime and urban scene has had a recent renaissance and continued to flourish last year, with BBK headlining\nWireless Festival and Skepta selling out Alexandra Palace for his stunning homecoming concert. Skepta held it down\nfor us, representing London and the UK on a global stage. Skeppy has been the UK artist of the year and it\u2019s only right\nthat his album Konnichiwa should win this category.\nNominations | Made in the Manor, Kano | Landlord, Giggs | Growing over life, Wretch 32\nR&B album of the year\nA Seat at the Table, Solange\nThe Weeknd proclaims \u201cLegend of the Fall, took the year like a bandit\u201d, on Starboy and, although that\u2019s very difficult to argue\nwith, after much deliberation, we decided that he fell slightly short of having R&B Album of the Year. After a brief hiatus\nfrom dropping albums, RiRi returned to remind us all why she\u2019s one of the best pop artists of our generation. Frank Ocean\nalso returned after a not-so-brief hiatus from releasing anything and proved he really is deserving of all the hype. A lot\nhas been made of the Grammys overlooking Beyonc\u00e9 for album of the year. Well, she\u2019s getting overlooked here again\nbecause, at the Hood Grammys, we believe her little sister Solange had the R&B Album of the Year.\nNominations | Anti, Rihanna | Blonde, Frank Ocean | Campaign, Ty Dollar Sign | Starboy, The Weeknd\nHonourable shoutouts | PartyNextDoor 3, Partynextdoor| Sept. 5th, dvsn\nBest collab track\nFuture & The Weeknd - Low Life [Future , EVOL] \u201cI turn the Ritz into a poor house / It\u2019s like eviction number four now\u201d\nWe felt it was important to include this category for the culture. This category recognises those tracks for which you can just tell the\nartists really collaborated together to craft something special. The distinction between this category and the \u201cSong of the Year\u201d category is that, to be eligible for this category, the track requires more than just artists dropping feature verses on each other\u2019s beats.\nWe have to hear that the artists spent time together grinding in the studio to refine their collective art. Having said that, Low Life is a\nworthy winner, with the similarities in The Weeknd\u2019s flow on this track and on Six Feet Under from his Starboy album further testament to the hours spent in Future\u2019s company producing heat (the two tracks were likely made in the same recording sessions).\nNominations | Kanye West, The-Dream, Kelly Price, Kirk Franklin & Chance the Rapper \u2013 Ultralight Beam | Young Thug & Wyclef\nJean \u2013 Kanye West [Young Thug, Jeffery] | 21 Savage, Metro Boomin, Future \u2013 X [21 Savage & Metro Boomin, Savage Mode] |\nKanye West, Life of Pablo] |YG, Drake & Kamaiyah - Why you Always Hatin?

He won for the\nsimple fact that, once you hear \u201cIf Young Metro don\u2019t trust you I\u2019m gon\u2019 shoot you\u201d or \u201cMetro Boomin wants some more nigga\u201d on a\ntrack\u2019s intro, you just know the track is going to bang.\nNominations | Zaytoven, London on da Track, Travis Scott Southside\nHonourable shoutouts | Nineteen85\n\\\n\\\nR\ne\np\nu\nb\nl\ni\nc\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\nD\ne\nf\nJ\na\nm\nRecordings\\\\\n\n"

Maile\nHave you ever looked at a balloon and thought \u201cI would\u201d? Well you know what they say. You\nhaven\u2019t really played until you\u2019ve played with a 16-inch balloon. And by they I mean looners.\nD\nan got into\nthe shower,\nwashing himself.\nHolly said she\nwould clear up\nthe mess they\nhad made after the pump-to-pop in the sleeping bag.\nHe still couldn't believe what\nHolly did for his birthday.\nThey had had a few sessions\nwith balloons before but\nnothing like this. Last time\nthey had a blow-to-pop race\nwith twelve inches, it was fun\nbut Dan didn't know Holly\nwould get into it, she must\nhave been practicing. After\na few minutes Holly enters\nthe bathroom, completely\nnaked, holding a red balloon.\nIt\u2019s deflated but looks like a\n16-inch.\n\"Ready for a bit more fun?\"\nShe says in a sexy voice.\nDan feels his heart starting\nto race. Holly steps into the\nshower with him and takes the\nshower head off.\n\"What are you doing?\" Asks\nDan.\n\"You'll see.\" She places the\nneck over the balloon, it starts\nto fill with water.\n\"Sit down, you're going to\nenjoy this.\" She says.\nThat was an excerpt from a\nstory written by Wildheart, a\nsenior member of a \u2018looner\u2019\nforum called blow2pop.\nLooners are people who\nhave a sexual attraction to\ninflatable objects or the act\nof inflation, deflation or burst-ing. Looking online I found\nvast quantities of YouTube\nand XTube videos exhibiting\nthis exotic fetish, and forums\nfor like-minded people to\nshare experiences. Like most\nwell-established fetishes,\nlooning comes with a nice set\nof terms to describe specific\nactivities or subgroups.\nobject for popping.\nFrom reading popping\nstories, it looks like a lot\nof the sexiness lies in the\nanticipation. For the B2Pers,\nthe uncertainty of when\nthe balloon will pop plays\na big role, so it\u2019s sort of an\nabstracted form of sexual\nteasing. Like a lot of kinks and\nfetishes, there seems to be an\nelement of catharsis involved\ntoo. The sudden change of\nstate from order to disorder\nseems to bring with it a sense\nof release, which fits into the\nsexual dynamic.\nNon-poppers are inflatable\nsome custom-made to include\na \u2018love hole\u2019, although this is\nan uncommon feature.\nI saw a lot of fantasies\nabout being in collapsing\nbouncy castles, or involving the \u2018riding down\u2019 of an\ninflatable, which is basically\nsitting on it until it\u2019s out of air.\nThe sound of the air rushing\nout of the object is apparently\nquite a turn on. There were\nalso those who liked the idea\nof sitting on something as it\nwas pumped up, with some\nof like butts, legs and boobs\nso that\u2019s probably part of it.\nAs for the smell and sound,\npast experiences can shape\npeople in extremely complex\nways. Most people on these\nforums believe that their interest started very early on, with\nsome remembering specific\nchildhood experiences. One\nuser wrote about a balloon\nbeing popped in his face\nat a birthday party, which\nled to a life long phobia of\nballoon popping, but a strong\nsexual affinity for balloons\nand inflatables. This type of\nstory is far from uncommon in\nthe looning community. They\neven endearingly describe\npeople with this relationship\nto inflatables as \u2018Phobics\u2019.\nIt seems that, whatever the\nreason, looning runs deep.\nFor one man, it ran deep\nenough to destroy his mar-riage. Sharing these feelings\ndoesn\u2019t always end up going\nwell, but for the vast majority\nof cases, the partners tend to\nbe at most indifferent. In some\ncases they\u2019re even willing to\nindulge, so it doesn\u2019t always\nend in tears.\nWhilst I\u2019d be lying if I said\nthis isn\u2019t bizarre for my stand-ards, I know for sure that it\u2019s\nnot hurting anyone (beyond\nmaybe causing a slight ringing in the ears). So if you\u2019re a\nlooner, popper or phobic, just\nknow that you\u2019re not alone.\nBe yourself and loon on, you\ncrazy diamond.\nfetishists who don\u2019t have any\ninterest in the bursting of\ninflatables. Whilst having a\nlot in common with poppers,\ntheir interest lies solely in the\nobjects. A common theme\nis the rubbing of inflatable\nobjects on the body or\ngenitals, inflating them with\na pump, or deflating them.\nInflatable pool toys, love dolls\nor airbeds are often ridden\nor sat on for satisfaction, with\nhaving preferences for types\nof valves, with Boston valves\nbeing a common favourite.\nThe derivation of pleasure\nseems to stem from a wide\nrange of stimuli, but for most\nlooners it is about the feel,\nsmell and sound. It\u2019s hard to\npin down exactly what is sexy\nabout a fetish. If you could,\nit probably wouldn\u2019t be a\nfetish. I guess inflated things\nhave curves and shapes kind\n\\\\ A popper is\nan individual who\nderives satisfaction\nfrom bursting inflatable objects \\\\\nLooners are separated into\ntwo main groups, \u2018Poppers\u2019\nand \u2018non-poppers\u2019.\nA popper is an individual\nwho derives satisfaction from\nbursting inflatable objects.\nThis can be achieved in a\nvariety of ways and enjoyed\nfor a multitude of reasons.\nPoppers enjoy activities such\nas popping balloons under-foot, hugging and squeezing\nballoons tight until they burst.\nAnother popular one is B2P\nor blow-to-pop; this is inflating\nthe balloon, usually by mouth\nuntil it pops. This is generally\ndone with ear plugs so not to\ndamage hearing as the noise\ncan be loud, especially when\nplaying with larger balloons.\nOthers are aroused by the\nidea of popping balloons with\npens, pencils, pins or knives,\nand often have a preferred\n\n"

This will\nmean that some of the most\n\\\\ The Imperial\nHealth Centre\nwill now send text\nmessages to those\nbeing treated for\nmental health\nproblems \\\\\nvulnerable of our members\nare less likely to fall through\nthe cracks or run out of their\nmedicines. EJ has also worked\nclosely with College on a grant\nbid for bystander intervention\ntraining and Sexual Violence\nLiaison Officers, who will coordinate College\u2019s response to\nsexual violence and act as a\npoint of contact for students\nand staff. EJ has also reinvig-orated the Union\u2019s approach\nto tackling study stress with\nthe Under Pressure campaign.\nAs well as constitutionally\nchanging the role of Deputy\nPresident (Finance & Services)\nto be less administrative and\nmore strategic, Rachel has\ndirectly overseen the introduction of the new Electronic\nPoints Of Sale (EPOS), which\nwill mean faster service for\nyou at our bars and shops.\nFurthermore, in order to make\nthe Union\u2019s accounts more\naccessible, in line with Our\nStrategy, Rachel has started\na series of account infograph-ics to allow students to have\na more direct say in how the\nUnion is run. Rachel has also\ntaken the student lead on pushing for College, and the Union,\nto become leaders in environmental sustainability. Let\u2019s not\nforget to mention that by working with the Islamic Society and\nCollege we managed to refurbish the Brothers\u2019 Prayer Room\nin Princes Gardens this year.\nFinally, we have also launched\nOur Strategy 2017-20, which\nsets out how Imperial College\nUnion intends to deliver a\nworld-leading student expe-rience. This, like many of the\naccomplishments above, could\nnot have been achieved by just\nthe OT team, but relied on the\nvaluable contributions from\npermanent members of Union\n& College staff, members of\nCouncil and a huge number\nof student volunteers \u2013 and I\nwould be remiss to not thank\nthem for their efforts to improve\nthe lives of students at Imperial.\nHowever, there is still a lot for\nthe team to do in order to give\nyou \u2013 our members \u2013 the experience you deserve. In the next\nsix months we will be relaunch-ing our new and improved Life\nMembership, supporting the\nroll-out of the College\u2019s Rent\nGuarantor Scheme, improving\nthe student sport experience,\nconsulting on the new Well-being Reps roles, extending the\n\\\\ Rachel has\ndirectly overseen the\nintroduction of the\nnew Electronic Points\nOf Sale, which will\nmean faster service\nfor you at our bars\nand shops \\\\\nacademic Feedback Traffic\nLight system, conducting a\nreview of our democratic\nstructures, ensuring Our Strategy 2017-20 is embedded into\neverything we do and much,\nmuch more.\nSo as nominations close on\nSunday, you may be thinking\n\"why should I run to be an\nOfficer Trustee?\" Run to effect\nsignificant change, and run to\nimprove the student experience for years to come.\n\\\\ Run to effect\nsignificant change,\nand run to improve\nthe student\nexperience for years\nto come \\\\\nAlso I hear you went to the\nhouse of Lords ;)\nDoes this statement hold given\nour plummeting economy?\nHow many working groups\ndid it take?

Kudos.\nE\nlections are fast-approaching and\ncampus will soon\nbe overwhelmed by\ncandidates eager for\nyour votes, but it may\nsurprise you that February\nonly marked the halfway\nperiod for the current Officer\nTrustees\u2019 (OTs') term of office.\nIt\u2019s normally around this\ntime of year that the well-worn criticism, \u201cthe sabbs\ndon\u2019t do anything\u201d, is trotted\nout to play down the coming\nelections. Pleasingly, I haven\u2019t heard that phrase very\noften this year, either because\nI am completely out of touch\nor perhaps because this\nyear\u2019s Officer Trustees have\nbeen getting on with things.\nSo, what have Emily-Jane\n(EJ), Luke, Rachel, James\nand I been up to? Well, here\nis our highlights reel for the\nfirst half of our term in office.\nAfter years of blood, sweat\nand tears (and that was just\nme during revision time) the\nCollege have agreed (and\nfinal authorisation has now\nhappened, whoop) to install\nair-conditioning in the Central\nLibrary! This is a huge win for\nus students, costing millions of\npounds, which follows years of\nlobbying by Officer Trustees\non students\u2019 behalf, and shows\nthat the College are listening to\nus and willing to invest in our\nstudent experience. Whilst on\nthe subject of infrastructure,\nworking with College we have\ninvested \u00a3180,000 to soundproof and remodel the Jazz\n& Rock studio (opening again\nnext term) so student bands\ncan rehearse and record\nin a purpose-built facility.\nIn education, Luke has led our\nwork with Vice-Provost (Edu-cation) Prof. Simone Buitendijk\nto develop a new Learning &\nTeaching Strategy that, when\ncompleted, will underpin an\nactive, technologically-en-hanced teaching revolution\nto future-proof Imperial education for the 21st\nCentury.\nFurthermore, heading up the\nAcademic Rep Network, Luke\nhas led our response to College\u2019s worst National Student\nSurvey scores in ten years,\ncoordinating and encouraging\nchange across departments,\nfaculties and College. We\u2019ve\ndone all this to a backdrop\nof huge legislative change in\nthe Higher Education sector,\ncaused by the introduction of\nthe Teaching Excellence Framework and the Higher Education\n& Research Bill, which has triggered the Union to develop a\nnew Higher Education Funding\nstance. Oh! And we also\nscrapped the zero-tolerance\npolicy for late submission.\nMeanwhile, James completed\na major manifesto pledge\nwhen we announced that\nfunding for Clubs, Societies\nand Projects would increase\nnext year by over \u00a335,000\nto \u00a3390,000 \u2013 the highest\nincrease in our history. He has\nalso delivered a CSP Management Group restructure,\nsomething that has been painfully overdue, which will make\nadministrating clubs more\nMaybe because student\napathy is at its highest point\never. This is probably not true.\nWe just felt like we\n\\\\ Luke has led our\nresponse to College's\nworst National\nStudent Survey\nscores in ten years \\\\\n\\\\ Oh! And we also\nscrapped the zero-tolerance policy for\nlate submission \\\\\nI hear frosted tips is also a\ngood look.\nFeels like it's been years.\nDon't know how much the\nUnion had to do with this. The\nlibrary went rogue.\nYay?\nAnd a felix petition \u2013 don't\nforget the felix petition.\nWhat does that even mean? Is\nthis a toothpaste commercial?\nWhat students actually wanted didn't\nhappen, College shot them down. Students\nwanted a 10% penalty for every day of\nbeing late.\nFrom the Union website: \"The Union stood by\nthis as the preferred alternative to zero-toler-ance in favour of the views of students.\" \"The\nnew policy will mean that work that is submitted up to 24 hours after the deadline will be\ncapped at the pass mark, anything submitted\nbeyond 24 hours will then be zeroed.\" \"The\nUnion are delighted in achieving one of its\npre-existing objectives by lobbying College\nwith our most powerful mechanism: the student voice!\"\nSuch stunning innovations include the\nrebranding of Biomedical Science\nto Medical Biosciences. Can't wait\nfor the rebranding of DPFS to DPSF.\n#thefutureisnow\nI don't really understand it. I'm\nnever late. I either do the work or\nI don't.\nAh the Jazz and rock saga which started three years ago. When the Union\nspent hundreds of thousands in the West Basement redevelopments. But\nthe construction company completely fucked up and ripped the Union off,\nmaking a practice room which lacked appropriate insulation, which led\nto noise complaints from students living above it in Beit, which has led to\nanother \u00a3180,000 going into it. Originally the Jazz and Rock re-redevel-opment was meant to have been completed by the end of the winter break.\nThen it got pushed back to February, then March, now it's not expected to\nbe complete until next term. Our guess is the Jazz and Rock room will not\nbe done until 2020.\n\n"

Blah.Blah.Blah\nfelixonline.co. uk /comment comment.felix@ic.ac.uk\nC O M M E N T\nIs the Union\nfixing the\nleadership\nelections?\nAn anonymous writer discusses the\nUnion's interference in the democratic\nprocess\nI\nt's a well known fact\nthat if you\u2019re one of\nthe beautiful people,\nyou\u2019re more likely to\nbe successful in the\nUnion elections. But\nas well as having beauty\nbe a requirement, there is\nalso a culture of successful\ncandidates being chosen from\nabove.\nTo say that the Union (and by\nthat I mean the staff and student trustees) have no say on\nwho wins the elections would\nbe to deny them credit for\ntheir hard work in obscuring\nthe democratic process. While\ntechnically, yes, the student\nbody does vote and elect the\nwinners, who chooses to run\nand the nature of their campaigns is incredibly dependent\non the advice they\u2019ve been\ngiven, which makes a huge\ndifference to who we elect.\nSuitable candidates are often\nheadhunted, vetted, and persuaded to run. Year on year,\nI\u2019ve seen offhand comments\nfrom a Sabb at a bar night\n\u2013 \u201cYou\u2019d be great at DPFS,\nyou should run!\u201d \u2013 that were\nnot so offhand: they\u2019d been\ndiscussed extensively in the\nUnion offices before. Of\ncourse, it is sometimes just\nfriendly encouragement to do\nsomething you\u2019re obviously\npassionate about \u2013 they\u2019re\n\\\\ Whatever the Leadership\nElections are, they're definitely\nnot democratic, so let's not\npretend that they are \\\\\nnot all terrible people. But\nthese conversations about\nthe role and what\u2019s best for\nit going forward can subtly\nbrainwash candidates into\ntrusting the current policies,\nnot questioning and improving\nthem as would be their role.\nChosen candidates might\nbe told historically successful\ncampaigning strategies, and\ninformally prepped for the\nrole through friendly chats \u2013\nnothing technically against\nthe rules, but not everyone is\nreceiving this information, and\nit lends a huge advantage.\nThose who\u2019ve won know that\ncampaigning often comes\ndown to a simple formula of\nwho gets their name out there\nmost and who does the most\nlecture shout-outs (name recognition and a trustworthy face\nis key), and being backed by\nsomeone in a position you\nrespect does a lot to help you\npower through the exhausting\nweeks of campaigning.\nThe Union (and by that I mean\nthe staff and student trustees)\nhave been known to help their\nchosen candidates write manifesto points that they know are\nachievable and in line with\ntheir current aims: they fulfil\ntheir bigger picture. In other\nwords, these candidates aren\u2019t\nbringing anything new to the\nrole in terms of ideas and student representation.\nIt\u2019s in the Union\u2019s interest to\nhave docile, obedient officer\ntrustees. They want sabbs who\nwon\u2019t make waves, who won\u2019t\npush a strong agenda. They\nwill work hard at the tasks\nthey\u2019re given, sure, but their\nmanifesto points are just reiterations of what was in the works\nanyway. In other words, they\nkeep their mouths shut and let\nthe staff do their job: running\nthis multimillion pound charity\nin the way that they see fit,\naway from the interference of\nannoying students who dare\nto have opinions on what it\nshould be doing.\nThe students who do this\nbest are the ones who are in\nit for the CV points \u2013 they care\na bit, but not enough to protest too much at only being a\nfigurehead. Undeniably, this\nis efficient. Nothing prevents\nan idea being realised like a\nclash between Union staff and\nan officer trustee, where butting of heads can lead to deep\nunpleasantness and a stalling\nof any progress whatsoever.\nFrom the perspective of those\nwho have worked hard on poli-cies, either for a year or longer,\nyou don\u2019t want someone with\ndifferent ideas to come in and\ntrash all your work. There\u2019s\nnothing like the illusion of\npower to make people think\nthat what they\u2019re doing is the\nbest, and it\u2019s easy to lose track\nof that and become incredibly\nprotective of your (sometimes\nmisguided) policies.\nIn many ways, the current\nsabbs are the most qualified\nto choose their replacements.\nThey know the ins and outs of\nthe role, and they should be\nable to recognise what traits\nwill make a good candidate.\nIt\u2019s great that the Union are\nthinking about the students in\nthe many volunteering roles\nand considering how they\ncould progress to bigger\nthings. When the Union hits\nthe mark, and wants to do\nthings that really are best for\nImperial students, this can be\n\\\\ To say that the\nUnion have no say\non who wins the\nelections would be\nto deny them credit\nfor their hard work\nin obscuring the\ndemocratic process \\\\\nreally good. Our Union staff\nhave largely come to Imperial after working in student\nunions all over the country, and\nbetween them have a wealth\nof experience. Unfortunately,\nthe nature of Imperial as an\nelite, science and engineering university means that the\nneeds of our students are a bit\ndifferent to those of students at\nother British universities, and\ntoo frequently the staff don\u2019t\ntailor their ideas to this. They\ndon\u2019t always realise that what\nworked well in Leeds may not\nwork at Imperial.\nThe policies and strategies\nare being guided by the staff at\nthe Union and those who have\nspent a year in the belly of the\nbeast and can\u2019t remember the\nreal struggles that affect students most. Bringing in more\npeople who are on the same\npage can be a huge waste\nof money that\u2019s supposed to\nbe spent on representing the\nactual voice of students. It isn\u2019t\nthe students who stick to the\nUnion agenda who make a big\ndifference \u2013 it\u2019s the ones who\ncall for radical change.\nWhatever the Leadership\nElections are, they\u2019re definitely\nnot democratic, so let\u2019s not pretend that they are.\n\\\\ It's in the Union's\ninterest to have docile,\nobedient officer\ntrustees \\\\\n404 - FILE NOT FOUND\n404\n- FILE\nN\nO\nT\nFO\nUN\nD\n404 - FILE NOT FOUND\nAn ode to my\nroommate,\nwhom I love\n\\\\ Sometimes I just wish\nthat everyone coud be\nat least as lucky as I\nam and have such an\nawesome roommate \\\\\nAn anonymous writer shares their love\nletter to their room- (and soul-) mate\nI\nlove my roommate.

I would reaaaally\nlike to be able to say \u2018yo\u2019 and\n\u2019bruv\u2019 the way she does. But I\nknow that she thinks about me\nall the time because she says\nthese words only when we are\nin public \u2013 when we are in our\nroom, she doesn\u2019t say a thing.\nI love the way she waits in\nfront of the door whenever\nI go into the bathroom in the\nmorning and invades the\nbathroom as soon as I am\nout, even if I am just out just\nbecause I forgot my lipstick\nin the room. I guess that I just\nhave to wait or skip lipstick\nbecause she ain\u2019t gonna finish\nin time for me. See, I actually\ncan speak street, I\u2019m just not\nvery good at the 'yo' part. But\nI\u2019ll learn, no worries!\nI love how she never gets\nher hair out of the shower\nand it regularly gets stuck in\nthe drain and how regularly\nthe bathroom gets flooded;\nand how afterwards, she\njust pretends that nothing\nhappened, no matter how\nmany times you ask her;\nand after a while, the room\nfloods too and then she can\nno longer pretend nothing\nhappened but she still audibly\nwonders how this happened!\nAnd I don\u2019t say that my hair is\nnot in there, too \u2013 but it is not!\nI dare you to DNA test it and\nsee if you can find more than\none hair that\u2019s mine.\nI like how her half of the room\nis just a mess.

Oh wait, I know \u2013\nbecause normally, my half is\nthe one that gets flooded first.\nI love how she loves the\nenvironment so much that\nshe never uses the washing\nmachines and always hand\nwashes her clothes in the sink\n\u2013 don\u2019t ask me how it works!
