    "content": "Centrepoint sleep out If you walk past Electrical Engineering next\nWednesday morning and wonder why there is a cardboard city there rather than the usual mass of\nbicycles here's the reason why:\nThe problem of youth homelessness is apparent to\nanyone walking around central London. Many young\npeople experience serious difficulties in finding a home\nof their own. These difficulties are accentuated in\nLondon where housing costs are high and where there\nhas been a decline in availability of both public and\nprivately owned rented property. In the capital it is\nestimated that there are now over 50,000 people\naged 16 to 19 in temporary accommodation such as\nsquats, hostels and bed and breakfast hotels.\nThe ma'Pnty of homeless young people in London\nhave come from areas of high unemployment in\nsearch of work. Many have been compelled to leave\ntheir previous accommodation or parental home and\nsince then have slept rough at some stage. Few are\nable to return to their last settled base. Young\nhomeless people come at the bottom of allocations\nof housing to homeless people by local authorities.\nWith no address it is difficult to obtain either a job or\nbenefit.\nSo what's to be done? Government action to deal\nwith the situation has been limited. Many voluntary\norganisations and charities exist to try to alleviate the\nproblems faced by homeless young people. The\nsleep out that will occur in College is in aid of one such\norganisation-Centrepoint Soho. Centrepoint provides\nVino!\nThose of you who attended Tuesday's tasting will\nhave, like me, tasted some of their favourite Spanish\nwines to date during the evening.\nPenny Drinkwater presented us with a personal\nselection of the best wines from the Spanish Wine\nimporters: Moreno which are easy to find in local\nsupermarkets and wine merchants. The wines were\nall modestly priced but the general quality was very\nhigh.\nThe cheapest wine on tasting was also my personal\nfavourite: the red Vega de Torro '84 costing \u00a33.35.\nThe favourite wines of the evening were both red and\ncame from Rioja: the rich claret-like Marques de\nCaceres '85 (\u00a34.39) and the more burgundy-style\nFanstino V'85( \u00a34.99). We tasted an astonishing\n'love it or hate it' old-style white Rioja: The Marques\nde Murneta '85 for \u00a36.65 which reeked of oak and\nblack current leaves and was more powerful than\nmany reds I 've tried. The tasting ended (sadly) with\na fifteen year-old red Rioja: the 1975 Gran Reserva\n(meaning oak aged for two years followed by at least\nthree years in the bottle before being sold) from\nBodegas Berbevaua.\nThroughout the tasting Penny relentlessly regaled\nus with interesting facts on the wines, favourite\naccompanying dishes and even a recipe or two!\nThe next tasting s on the agenda is an Australian\nwine tasting by Orlando (a company to watch out\nfor i), the Sherry Tasting on March 6 and the tasting\ngiven by our new Honorary President Dave Rowe, an\nex-IC 'FELIX' Editor and presently editor of Decanter,\non white wines from Bordeaux. Events mostly take\nplace in the Senior Common Room (SCR) on Tuesdays\nat 6pm, entrance fee for members is \u00a32 (\u00a31 extra for\nnon-members) and everyone including students, staff\nand guests are welcome.\nSalut!\nan emergency shelter for young homeless people who\nhave nowhere else to go. It also provides help and\nadvice for people to re-establish themselves.\nCentrepoint provides long term supportive hostels for\nyoung homeless people who need a supportive\nenvironment.\nCentrepoint also manages flats and beds its which\nWellsoc\n'Then a spout of yellow flame licked up its length from\nthe stern engine, and swift, swifter, swifter, and\nflaring like a rocket, it rushed down upon the solid\nmass of mas one ry which was formerly the Royal\nCollege of Science...'\nHG Wells, Argonauts of the Air\nThe student's club is crushed and turned into an\ninferno by the flaming para fin that explodes from the\naeroplane engines. This is how HG Wells portrays the\nconclusion of man's first attempt at motorised flight,\na disaster that destroys his old college!\nHow does the history of Imeprial College help us to\nunderstand the present education debate? Why did\nWells feel so strongly about the Normal School of\nScience, as it was called when he was a student?\nOur College was at the forefront of the great\neducation debates of the past, especially during the\nimplementation of teacher training and compulsory\nschooling. This history involved such great men as\nProfessor TH Huxley, Lord Haldane, Professor\nBlackett and Sir Linstead.\nThere will be an exhibition in the Haldane Library,\na book display in the bookshop, a talk, and a debate.\nSo keep your eyes open for the forthcoming Great\nImperial Debate.\n'Why did HG Wells blow-up Imperial College?'

It will increase\nawareness in Imperial College of the problem of\nLondon's youth homelessness.\nTrainspotter\nLast week saw the annual general meeting of the\nImperial College Union Trainspotters Society. Miss\nMichelle Bigun was unanimously elected once more\nas Chairman of the society. Simon Bradshaw's post\nof Honorary Secretary fell to Emmanuel Saridakis,\nwho now hopes to see a new form of regalia in the\nsociety. Anyone with designs and ideas for our anorak\nemblem should contact Miss Bigun on extension 3500\nas soon as possible. There is a \u00a3 3 0 prize for the\nwinning design. Entry forms are available from Jen\nHardy-Smith in the Union Office.\nShooting\nFollowing last week's horrifying result the ICR&PC\nteam stormed to victory against both Cambridge and\nLeeds Universities. The match was shot at Cambridge,\nwho again refrigerated their range, so in an attempt\nto stay warm we humour ed them by indulging in their\nstrange ritual of standing in a3ft deep hole whilst\nshooting.\nThe match was won convincingly (IC 1,988,\nCambridge 1,925, Leeds 1,826, all out of 2,400)\ndespite the captain (Tony Menzies) shooting an\nabysmal 482/600 (our worst score, lower even than\nRob who only made the team a couple of days before\nthe match) which is odd as he can shoot 525/600\nquite happily when not in competition (some people\njust can't take the pressure you know). When\nquestioned about this later he was heard to exclaim\n'Bollox, I think I 'll take up rifle!'. (Note: this is a pretty\ndesperate thing for a pistol shooter to say.)\nP.S. for anyone who is interested there are actually\nwomen in Cambridge, though Tim seems to have a monopoly on these (as well as the top scores).\nPage 10\n\n"

    "content": "Athletics\nWell, some order is beginning to emerge after the\nsurprise hold- up in the development of the Harlington\nastroturf. It is clear that the astroturf should not be\nlaid down at excessive cost, and therefore the\nreappraisal of the proposal because of the high tenders\nreturned from contractors has proved to be wise.\nHowever, we should never have reached this situation\nin the first place. It emerged after a meeting of the\nGoverning Body last week that none of the relevant\npersonnel within College administration had actually\nseen the tender before it was submitted to the\npotential contractors. The tender was drawn up by\na consultant, who will no doubt expect a hefty\nconsultancy fee, and was hopelessly over-specified.\nOther companies have described this consultant's speciality as being the production of Olympic standard\npitches. I hope that someone in College administration\nwill be made accountable for such poor work,\nespecially as students in the hockey club were able\nto produce cheaper quotes for astro pitches simply by\nringing around contacts in companies (including\ncompanies which had tendered for the contract as\nspecified by College). A copy of the tender has now\nbeen obtained through other sources and is being\nexamined by Neil McCluskey and hockey club\nrepresentatives. Next week, a meeting will take place\nof the Trustees to determine exactly how much say\nthey will have in deciding the expenditure of monies\nfrom the Trust. It is obvious that various people within\nCollege are unhappy with the power that has been\nentrusted in the three Trustees, and with their decision\nto expend solely on capital ventures which will benefit\nthe sporting activities of IC Union. It is in the students'\ninterests to maintain the Trustees' present position\nas one is the present Union President and one an ex-President. There are plans in the pipeline for a Sports\nHall (not the rather over-ambitious Sports Centre\nproposed a couple of years ago) on the hard tennis\ncourts next to Linstead Hall, and a Health Suite to go\ninto Southside Gym. It is therefore also essential that\nthe Trust funds be set aside for use on sporting\nfacilities only and are not diverted to other projects.\nThe building of a Sports Hall next to Linstead will be\nof advantage to many students who at present are\nforced to use the unsatisfactory Volleyball Court in\nthe Chemistry building. Planning details for the\nastroturf must be submitted to the local council in mid-March, so I hope that all these issues will be resolved\nsoon.\nBen Turner, ACC Chairman.\nVijay Thakur, SCAB Treasurer, is also standing for\nthe sabbatical post of IC Union Deputy President.\nALL\nSabbatical Candidates\nYOU MUST PAY FOR\nYOUR PUBLICITY BY\n5.00pm TODAY OR\nYOU WILL NOT\nRECEIVE IT AT 5.30pm International\nThe party's over, the mess cleaned up and so now\ncomes the time to thank all those people who\nparticipated in the International Night.

    "content": "system in the third dimension, all previous missions\nhaving been confined to the ecliptic plane. This feat\nis possible through the clever use of Jupiter's immense gravitational pull which will catapult Ulysses\nout of the ecliptic and arc it back and over the Sun.\nImperial College is contributing two of the nine\ninstruments flying on Ulysses. These instruments will\nprovide the first ever measurements of the three\ndimensional structure of the solar wind, the steam of\ncharged particles leaving the Sun, and its embedded\ninterplanetary magnetic field. These measurements\nwhich are vital for our understanding of how the solar\nwind originates. They will also give rich data on the\npropagation and acceleration of solar energetic\nparticles which are important for the prediction of\n'space weather' at Earth.\nGalileo will flyby two aster io ds on its long\ninterplanetary voyage to Jupiter. These encounters\nsignal a growing interest in primitive bodies (comets\nand asteroids) during the coming decade; an interest\nwhich arises because these bodies are believed to\ncontain pristine material from the origin of the solar\nsystem. Three missions have already been approved\ndedicated solely to primitive body studies: GEM, CRAF\nand Rosetta (see table). Imperial has experimental and\ntheoretical expertise in this area having flown the first\ninstrument ever to detect a comet in space (the\nenergetic particle experiment on the International\nCometary Explorer encounter with comet GiacobiniZinner in September 1985) and provided much of the\nsubsequent theoretical development on how the solar\nwind interacts with comets. GEM stands for 'Giotto\nextended mission' and involves the reactivation of the\nGiotto spacecraft (which brought us such spectacular\npictures of the nucleus of Halley's comet in 1986) and\nits tar getting to comet Grigg-Skjellerup which it will\nreach in July 1992. NASA's comet rendezvous and\nas teri oid flyby mission (CRAF) will send the first\nMariner Mark II spacecraft to rendezvous with comet\nKopff near the orbit of Jupiter and then track it at\ndistances between 20 and 5000 km during its\npassage around the Sun. Imperial are contributing to\nthe CRAF m agent ic field experiment; an instrument\ncrucial for studying the comet/solar wind interaction.\nWhile en route to comet Kopff, CRAF will also flyby\nasteroid 449 (Hamburga). CRAF will be followed by\nthe ESA/NASA Rosetta mission whose purpose is to\nreturn a refrigerated comet nucleus sample to Earth.\nOf all the planets, Mars must surely evoke the\nMission Objective Space Agency Launch Date Imperial Involvement\nMagellan Venus orbiter NASA May 1989\nGalileo Asteroid flyby, Jupiter\norbiter and atmosphere\nprobe\nNASA October Contributing to the\nmagnetic field\ninvestigations\nUlysses Solar wind exploration ESA/NASA October 1990 Leadership of the\nmagnetic field\ninvestigation and\ncontributing to the\nenergetic particles\ninvestigation\nMars Observer Mars orbiter NASA 1992\nGEM Comet flyby ESA 1992\nMARS 94 Mars orbiter and\nsurface stations\nSoviet 1994 Contributing to the\nmagnetic field and\nparticle investigation\nSOHO Sun's interior and\natmosphere\nESA/NASA 1995\nCluster 4-satellite Earth\nmagnetosphere mission\nESA/NASA 1995 Leadership of the\nmagnetic field\ninvestigation\nCRAF Comet rendezvous\nand asteroid flyby\nNASA 1995/96 Contributing to the\nmagnetic field\ninvestigation\nCassini Saturn orbiter and\nTitan probe\nESA/NASA 1996 Proposal submitted\nfor leadership of\nthe magnetic field\ninvestigation\nRosetta Comet nucleus\nsample return\nESA/NASA 7\ngreatest sense of mystery and fascination. Excitement\nwas high last year when the Soviet Phobos 2\nspacecraft became the first probe since NASA's twin\nViking landers in 1976 to reach the red planet. Despite\nits premature failure, Phobos did return new and\nimportant scientific data especially concerning the\nsolar wind interaction (see Science feature by\nProfessor Southwood in FELIX issue 855). Now\nseveral further Mars missions are under development,\ntwo of which are approved: NASA's Mars Observer\nand the Soviet MARS 94 missions (see table). Of\nthese, MARS 94 is the more ambitious consisting of\ntwo spacecraft which will deploy surface stations and\nlaunch balloons, with TV cameras and surface-contacting 'snakes' (Figure 2). The search for possible\nlife is a primary objective and these missions, if\nsuccessful, will be followed by a Rover Sample Return\nMission around 2001.\nFig. 2. Dual balloon concept for probing the Martian surface. Courtesy of Michael Carroll.\nThe first cornerstone missions of ESA's long term\nspace plan, the so-called 'Horizon 2000' project, are\nthe solar terrestrial science missions SOHO and\nCluster. Their objective is to attack the key\noutstanding problems in solar and Earth space plasma\nphysics. SOHO (Solar and Heliospheric Observatory)\nwill be stationed about 1.5 million kilometres sun ward of the Earth and will study the Sun, both its interior\nand outer corona where intense heating occurs\nthrough an unknown process, to generate the solar\nwind. The Cluster mission, which complements\nSOHO, consists of four identical space probes orbiting\nat various separations through the magnetic field\nsurrounding the Earth (magnetosphere). Cluster will\nstudy how the magnetospheric plasmas react to\nvarying solar conditions and permit the first ever three\ndimensional point measurements of magnetised space\nplasmas, thereby allowing important quantities such\nas electric currents and the swirling of these plasmas\nto be measured directly for the first time. Imperial is\nproviding leadership on the four magneto meters flying\non Cluster.\nThe detailed exploration of Saturn and its planet-sized moon Titan form a recent additional planetary\nobjective for the '90s. This advanced joint ESA/NASA\nmission, called Cassini, comprises an orbiter to\ninvestigate Saturn's elaborate and interacting system\nof rings, icy satellites and complex magnetosphere,\nand an atmosphere probe which will slowly descend\nthrough Titan's organically rich atmosphere to land,\npossibly, in its hydrocarbon ocean. The chemistry\ntaking place in Titan's atmosphere may resemble\nreactions which occurred on the primitive Earth.\nCassini's scientific return will be enhanced by flybys\nof Jupiter and at least one asteroid. Experimental\nproposals for Cassini are under review and Imperial\nis bidding to provide leadership on the magnetic field\ninvestigation.\nIn conclusion, I hope this short article has provided\na flavour for the exciting future facing solar system\nexploration in the '90s. A fleet of sophisticated robotic\nprobes will undertake ambitious missions to several\nof the planets, moons, as teri oid s and comets, thereby\npaving the way for human exploration and possible\nsettlement early in the 21 st century. Imperial College\nscientists are set to play leading roles in this\nendeavour where small steps may well lead to giant\nleaps for humankind.\nDr Mark Saunders, Blackett Laboratory.\nPage 9\n\n"

    "content": "Harlington's history\nOver the past five or six years there has been a lot\nsaid about the ownership of Harlington. The argument\nstarted as a result of a proposed gravel extraction from\nthe sports ground. This extraction is presently in\noperation and is worth in the region of \u00a3 3 million, but\nthe argument goes deeper than this. Very recently it\nhas become apparent that the College will do almost\nanything to make money or put existing money to their\ndesired purpose. Many London colleges have seen\nsections of their sports grounds sold off, St Mary's is the most recent but many have lost theirs\naltogether. Surely this puts the future of their sporting\nactivities in doubt; IC sports clubs are expanding we\ndo not want to see a reduction in the facilities. The\nCollege has shown no incentive for the improvement\nof the generally limited quality of sports facilities\navailable to students at IC whilst the student have\nbeen fruitlessly battling for facilities for years.\nSo who does own Harlington and have rights to the\nnew gravel fund? Up until now the whole argument\nhas revolved around statements made at the time of\npurchase of Harlington in September 1936. There is\nno doubt that the College bought the ground and\nacted as the legal purchaser, but whose money were\nthey spending and on what authority and advice did\nthey act? The answer to this lies further back in\nhistory in 1919 when the ground was very young.\nIn 1919 the College had four student organisations;\nthe three Constituent College Unions (CCUs) which\nran in a similar but more active manner to today's CCUs and the Imperial College Union. The Union of\nthe day was very different to our current one. It had\na President who was one of the three CCU Presidents,\neach CCU taking rotating turns at the post, a treasurer\nwho was a College Governor and an ex-student of the\nRCS, and a Secretary who was a Professor and also\na Governor. Whether the Treasurer and Secretary\nwere Governors as a result of their posts in the Union\nor vice versa is not clear. The Imperial College Union\nhad one committee, the Management Committee,\nwhich took responsibility for all of the Unions'\nactivities, ie the running of the bar and catering outlets\nalong with laying on entertainment. The Imperial\nCollege Union was often called the Imperial College\nClub (ICC).\nThe ICC had been running for around eight years,\nof which four had been during the Great War, it was\nfunded in very much the same way as the CCUs in\nthat each student paid a yearly membership fee of \u00a32\n10s which was split between the respective CCU and\nICC by 3/5 to 2/5.\nThere is little doubt that the money that bought\nHarlington was originally derived from the purchase\nand development of the War Memorial Ground in\n1920. Funded by the War Memorial Executive\nCommittee (WMEC) and student annual subscriptions,\nthe ground cost \u00a38000. It was this committee of\nUnion officers that asked in Feb 1920 'in the event\nof a suitable ground being ultimately acquired whether\nthe Governing Body would consent to the property\nbeing vested in their name as trustees?'. They did not\ngive the ground to the College but had no one else\nto place their trust in as IC Union was simply not well\nenough established.\nThe establishment of the Imperial College Students'\nCommittee almost immediately after the purchase of\nthe ground produced the nearest equivalent to the\npresent day UGM, which ultimately grew into such\na body whilst also developing a series of clubs and\nsocieties available to all IC students. This was the birth\nof the res presentation al, social and athletic side of IC\nUnion today and it was precipitated by the purchase\nof the Ground in Wembley.\nPage 6\nClearly realising that the ground did not belong to\nthem, the Governing Body opted not to show the\nWMG sports field on the College accounts. In 1922\nwhen discussing its disclosure on the accounts, Mr\nHobert Wright, Governor, explained 'that the ground\nwas vested in the College as trustees, the Committee\nagreed that it ought not to be included in the accounts\nof the College in any way.'\nThe development and running of the WMG was paid\nfor through student union subscriptions, until 1922,\nwhen the College agreed to collect a considerably\nlarger subscription to cover this and other new\nactivities that had developed as a result. The\ncollection of these fees by the College was merely an\nadministrative convenience; throughout the life of the\nMemorial Ground, expenditure and liability for its\nConsidering the solicitor's predicament, the choice\nof the title 'The Students' was a fair one. The Union\nwas fragmented and undergoing a transformation of\nits own as it took full responsibility for its own and\nthe CCU funds in a vastly expanded organs i ation. To\nexpect it to take control of a rapidly expanding and\ndeveloping group of athletics facilities was simply\nunreasonable. Hence the College set up what would\nnow be known as an Athletics Union to run the\nfacilities.\nAs the Athletic Union dissolved, the sports clubs\nwere placed in the hands of IC Union and the grounds\nfell to the College's Athletic Committee.\nThe sports facilities precipitated the formation of IC\nUnion as we know it and their purchase, development\nand administration was performed by students up until\nThe relaid hockey pitches have not improved since this picture was taken last y running were accounted for under the title Union\nAccounts.\nThe turning point for the Ground came in 1937,\nwhen the sports facilities were transferred to a College\naccount, held in trust to the students, a body with no\nlegal identity separate from the College.\nThe College had seen a chance to generate\nconsiderable revenue by selling the ground. By placing\nthe money in such a trust they could account for it\nlegally; the College's solicitor quite rightly noted that\nit could not be placed under any College account, even\nthe Union account could not be used as there was no\nindependent legal identity to separate it from College.\nHis only option was to show it as a bare trust,\nmeaning a trust upon which they held no rights of\nownership.\nthe College took control of them. Starting with an\noutright majority of students, College Athletic\nCommittee, which watched over the funds for sports\nactivities has seen its student membership fall by two.\nHarlington and the boat house are the Union's birthright held in trust for over seventy years. IC Union\nhas now grown up and should be given back control\nof its property for it to run as in the 1920s with the\nstudents having the right of decision and the College\nclaiming no rights to interfere. The first thing to be\ndone is to rename Harlington the War Memorial\nGround and erect plaques to the dead of the Great\nWar.\nby Sydney Harbour-Bridge\n\n"

Just\nlearn how to tune your guitars girls.\nThings got heavier with Horse (London!, Sweat,\ngrease and distortion flew. 'We won't take no shit',\nthey screeched, but they gave us enough. There'll be\na lot of people with whiplash in the morning.\nAt last Balaam entered to a moody Intro of lights\nand mist. '0' ya wanna party? Yeah!', restoring sanity\nwith pure, unashamed, traditional rock from the long\nhaired lads. They never flagged, playing from all three\nalbums and some covers in a set which ended at\n11.20 and still wasn't enough.\nI am still amazed at the six-second guitar change\nby Ian McKean during the latest single, Little Bit of\nLove, and the two foot blond dred s of guitarist Jim\nMorris were equally agile. They also included frenzied\nTwo Days of Madness and the favourite / Love the\nThings you do to Me and a lot of 'oo-yeahs'.\nSo what if they sound like The Cult (Electric) or Bon\nJovi, but who cares? They don't, and it was great.\nSJH.\nThe Mission\n\u2014Kilburn National 20.2.90\nThis was a show for video, with Wayne Hussey\n(frontman) resplendent in red and shades (yuk). The\nintro tape into Amelia was beautifully planned (double\nyuk) and the song links perfect, too perfect. Wayne\nsurvived as far as the first line of the third song,\nButterfly on a Wheel before throwing down his guitar\nand shouting; 'this is fuckin' crap. What do you\nwant?'.\nThis was a show for the fans. We got all the greats:\nLike a Hurricane, Tower of Strength, Wasteland and\nMr Pleasant. They may have changed their image on\nvinyl, but live they're still mega. They play along with\nthe audience, not to it.\nThe only danger came from the mounted camera\nplaying nine-pins with moshi ng missionaries.

For the first time the Ebb use a strong melodic element over their own characteristic\nelectronic juggernaut. Much of the album appears to\nbe based around traditional music-hall patterns.\nNobody Knows is the duo's own idiosyncratic effort\nat soft-shoe shuffle, My Heart is a violent ballad and\nLightning Man is a bluesy wail. Most of the other\ntracks can be forced into this pattern with the standout exception of Fun to be Had, the final track, which\nis pure Nitzer Ebb of old.\nShowtime is as energetic as ever and possesses a momentum which builds up from the accelerating\nopening strains of Getting Closer to crash to a halt two\nsides later with Fun to be Had. In this it more\nresembles the early New Beat thundering s of That\nTotal Age than its more sophisticated sibling Belief.\nWhile Hold On and One Man's Burden would fit easily\non the first LP, tracks such as Lightening Man are a logical and welcome progression of the foil's work.\nOnce again Nitzer Ebb steamroller the opposition\nand mine the seam they were the first to open.\nShowtime, an album of blood and cabaret, is released\non March 5.\nStone.\nESSENTIAL GUIDE TO\nGOOD GIGGING\nFriday 23rd February\nThe Meteors +\nThe Rattlers Opera on the Green\nTanita Tikaram Hammersmith Odeon\nSaturday 24th February\nThe Stranglers Brixton Academy\nMonday 26th February\nBlow-Up Camden Dingwalls\nTuesday 27th February\nThe Cramps Brixton Academy\nWednesday 28th February\nThe Cramps Brixton Academy\nThe Men They Couldn't Hang..Subterrannia\nThursday 1st March\nThe Creatures Town & Country Club\nIcicle Works Marquee\nEnergy Orchard Mean Fiddler\nFriday 2nd March\nThe Creatures Twon & Country Club\nEssential Gig of the Week\nSenseless Things + Carter the\nUnstoppable Sex Machine + Nutmeg...ULU\nSRI LANKAN\nSOCIETY\nThere will be a meeting of the\nSociety on February 28 at\n12.30pm in room 311, Huxley\nBuilding.

    "content": "FeliX The Ambulance Posters\nI don't care what political views the Conservative\nSociety hold, they were wrong to put up posters with\nthe slogan 'Support the ambulance men let the\npatients die.' People have died during the ambulance\ndispute; to attempt to make political gain from their\ndeaths is not only sick it is immoral. Fiona Nicholas\nwas right to ban the posters and remove them.\nFreedom of speech is one thing, sick-headed drivel like\nthis is another.\nElections\nThose irritating sabbatical candidates will be pestering\nyou for your vote from 5.30pm today. Many of them\nwill present you with schemes for the Union, few of\nwhich will be feasible. The best advice I can give is\nto vote on the basis of who you feel you can trust to\nstick with the job and do their best at it. Make sure\nthe candidate at least knows what they are taking on.\nAll four posts demand a great deal of their occupant;\nfew people realise just how much work is done by the\nsabbaticals. I feel a number of this year's candidates\nare likely to just collapse under the pressure of a commitment whose extent they did not realise.\nOn another note, I have heard a great deal about\ndirty dealings concerning the elections. I fully intend\nto reveal all the filth which has surrounded the\nelections after the results are announced. Much of it\nmakes pretty grim reading for certain individuals.\nThose candidates who pay for their posters and\nhandouts by 5.00pm today will be able to collect them\nfrom the FELIX Office at 5.30pm today. Manifestos\nmust reach the FELIX Office by 9.30am Monday 26th February. They should be no more than 300 words\nlong and will be cut at the 300th word if necessary.\nSpelling mistakes etc. will be reproduced exactly from\nthe candidate's manifesto. Candidates should also\nsubmit a photograph of themself. I am looking forward\nto a small bonfire at 9.35am if necessary. Manifestos\nmay be slipped under the FELIX Office door over the\nweekend, although FELIX accepts no liability for their\nsafety on this basis.\nAccommodation\nThe proposed 16% rent increases for Hamlet Gardens\nare frightening. With a possible 7% increase in the\nstudent grant for next year, this surely spells the doom\nof Imperial College. Students will not be able to afford\nto live in IC accommodation or any of the private\nsector housing without housing benefit next year. The\nlast meeting of Imperial College Union's Council\ndecided to take action over rent increases and inform\nfuture students of the costs they will have to face.\nThe final decision was, however, very woolly. Council\nleft it up to Neil McCluskey to decide on a course of\naction.\nAfter these rent increases I feel the Union is obliged\nas a potential welfare se vice to inform future students\nof housing costs. Information should be posted to\nschools and sixth form colleges. Students have to be\ntold NOW, while they still have a chance to delete\nImperial from their UCCA choices. Imperial College\nUnion would be weakened by a reduction in the\nCollege's undergraduate intake, but it should seriously\nconsider its moral obligation to potential students. If\nfuture students at IC are forced to live a life of poverty,\nPage 12\na large part of the blame will rest upon the Union's head for not warning them.\nAwards\nI am afraid I have to apologise to Sir Eric. I have not\nhad time to purchase the conniving g it award this\nweek, it will be arriving soon. Meanwhile, a book for\nManaging Surveyor of Residences, Peter Hallworth.\nI have thought a great deal about this week's title.\nSuggestions have ranged from Bleak House to\nWithering heights. I have finally decided upon Great\nExpectations. The theme and era of the titles goes\nwell with the College's housing, I feel.\nNext Issue\nLitho permitting, next week's issue will be a travel\nspecial. Could anyone who has promised an article\nplease hand it in on Monday please. There will be a staff meeting at 12.45pm on Tuesday lunchtime to\ndiscuss the issue.\nCredits\nMany thanks to last week's colla tors Ian Hodge,\nAdrian Butt, Wouter Van Hulten, Sitham Periasamy,\nSunny Ghaie, Richard Eyers, Ben Turner (Vijay Thakur\nis also running for the post of ICU Deputy President,\nand did not help collate), Anjali Saini, Chris Stapleton\n(Thomas Wyatt is also standing for the post of FELIX\nEditor and did not help collate), Sydney HarbourBridge and Jackie Scott (Doug King, Mark OrrowWhiting, Athos Ritsperis and Paul Shanley are also\nstanding for the post president and did not help\ncollate.).

    "content": "Out of context\nDear Dave,\nI am a great believer in freedom of choice, and so\nI feel compelled to comment on the article 'The RSMU\nare the Pits' and its accompanying letter 'Miners are\nChauvinists' in last week's FELIX.\nBoth features centred around criticism of the last\nissue of the RSMU newsletter. Both authors\nprincipally complained about the photo of the woman\non page 3. Although only one was correct in stating\nthat she was topless rather than fully naked, both took\nthe caption 'She's waiting for it' out of context. This\nwas not an isolated picture but was an integral part\nof an article, a feature previewing the Bottle Match\nat Camborne. As such the caption was a mere pun,\nadmittedly of a sexual nature, but most readers (men\nand women) treated it as it was meant-a bit of\nharmless fun. If this makes Peter want to 'head off\nto Brighton right now and rape a few women' then\nhe's got a problem.\nThe level of so called pornography in the Pit is no\nworse than that found in the Sun br Sunday Sporthugely popular publications freely available outside\n'the male chauvinist atmosphere within the RSM'. The\nPit is a newsletter read only by adults who want to\nread it. Neither Anna nor Peter have to pick it up next\ntime, no more than they are forced to buy those\nnewspapers.\nIn his letter Peter has the audacity to accuse most\nof the women in the RSM of being ignorant. He even\nadmits that the vast majority of them are not bothered\nby what he finds offensive. Who is he to tell them\nwhat they should think.\nThis issue is wider than the Pit, wider than RSM or\neven the College. It's about a tiny bunch of puritans\ntelling the rest of us what's good for us. Small minded\nMary Whitehouse types like these two should stop\ntrying to force their prudish values on other people.\nI suspect that they just feel too inhibited to have fun\nthemselves and therefore don't see why anyone else\nshould have any.\nIf the Pit makes you feel sick then don't read it-but while you're about it let the rest of us decide for\nourselves, instead of telling us what we should or\nshouldn't want.\nSteffan Fay, Geology 3.\nCommon as\nmuck\nDear Felix Editor,\nAs a reader of your magazine for many years I wish\nto complain about the Calumny Column and its\nabrasive comments. I believe that magazines are\nwritten for all people to read, not just a selected few.\nWhy has Ms Toynbee felt the need to use slang words\nreferring to genitalia and anus when she is talking\nabout people?\nWhy do you use a word associated with bowel\nmotions when you are writing to the general\npopulation of the College?\nNormal conversation is not punctuated with such\nwords and if your aspirations are to move into middle-class society then you will have to stop using them.\nWhy not start practising in this paper you edit and give\nan example to others.\nYours sincerely,\nMay Symers.\nSick, perverted\nDear Dave,\nMy God! I'm sorry! It appears that I have offended\ntwo very 'sensitive members' of the RSM (re 'RSMU\nare the Pits' by A Teeman and 'Miners are\nChauvinists' by P Sharp).\nI'm afraid that I am responsible for the pornographic\nDLB posters displayed in the RSM. Since reading the\nletters I have had many sleepless nights worrying\nabout the insensitive way I have portrayed the fe mate form (amongst other things!).\nI must be a sick, perverted, potential rapist (or at\nleast guilty of driving others into frenzied attacks\nbecause, let's face it, we're all rapists at the RSM!).\nI am disgusted with myself and have already\nconsulted a specialist about having a frontal lobotomy,\nin order to curb my rampant libido.\nThe only thing I have in my defence is that I'm a publicity officer and I seem to have accomplished my\ntask. I just hope the two saintly forms, who were\nobviously given my share of morals, will be able to\nstand living the rest of their days at RSM with the rest\nof us and accept my most sincere apologies.\nYours,\nMs Matthew Jupe (Feminist).\nP.S.I resign.\nP. P.S.I hope one of you will take up my 'post'. It's 'hard' but 'full-filling'.\nMore\nblatant\nDear Dave,\nI have noticed that over the past few weeks a certain Presidential candidate has managed to get his\nname in FELIX every week by dint of writing lots of\nletters. I thought that it was about time I got myself\nsome of this free publicity.\nYours sincerely,\nName withheld due to election publicity rules.\nThe ugly side of London\nDear Sir,\nAs an American College student studying in London\nfor five months, I have been trying to adapt and fit\ninto this culture. At the same time i have been making\nevery attempt to visit all the sights. Unfortunately, I have recently encountered something that I will never\nbe able to adjust to or accept: anti-semitism.\nI was browsing through Portobello Market a few\ndays ago when suddenly, without warning, I was\ndealt a severe blow to the head and an overwhelming\npunch to the stomach. My initial reaction was one of\nshock and horror; however, as tears glazed over my\neyes, those feelings quickly dissipated and I was left\nstanding on the street corner in sheer pain. Perhaps\nmy agony could have been appeased had witnesses\nto this terrible act helped capture the perpetrator of\nthe crime. Unfortunately, this case did not allow for\nsuch a perfect ending.\nThe crime to which I am making reference was not\none of physical battery; it was far more hurtful than\nthat. The cause of my pain came directly from the\nproud display of swastika arm bands hanging in the\nfourth stall from the corner of Portobello Road and\nLonglands Court (next to the Earl of Lonsdale pub).\nIt would seem that this insensitive act could only be\ncaused by ignorance, since I simply do not understand\nPage 14\nhow anyone in good consciousness would be able to\nsell, or buy for that matter, the infamous symbol of\nNazi Germany. The swastika was a symbol associated\nwith the barbaric slaughter of over six million Jewish,\nas well as non-Jewish, men, women and children\nduring World War Two.\nThe holocaust must never be forgotten or allowed\nto recur; therefore, it is imperative to understand the'\nhistory and madness that led up to it. When Adolf\nHitler made himself dictator of Germany in March\n1933, his narrowly nationalistic slogans, such as the\ninjustices of the Versailles Treaty of World War One,\nthe need for strong leadership, the ineffectiveness of\ndemocracy, and most of all the 'inequity' of the Jews,\nappealed to the vast major ty of the population living\nin the midst of widespread economic discontent.\nHitler's notion of a superior race, a perfect, highly\nintellectual, blond haired, blued eyed, Aryan race, was\nquickly absorbed and accepted without much debate.\nHitler rebuilt pride and nationalism throughout the\ncountry, and mended the egos of his German\ncom rad s. Next he went to work on national\nreunification as well as the destruction of the\nscapegoats that he had effectively developed-the\nJewish race. As German troops marched through\nEurope, Jews were rounded up and transported to\nghettos and concentration camps by the Nazis.\nIt was in these camps, of which adjectives to\ndescribe the horrors encountered do not exist, that\nJews were tortured and eventually killed. People were\ndissected while still alive. Lives were sacrificed during\n'scientific' experiments. Human skin was peeled off\nand manufactured into lampshades. Human beings\nwere forced to dig their own graves. Some were\nburied alive. Lucky ones simply died of hunger,\noverwork or overexposure. Families were separated,\nmost were destroyed. Those that miraculously\nsurvived suffer from their memories of the past to this\nday.\nCan it be possible that such unjustified hatred is still\nbeing perpetuated? The very notion that there is a market for swastikas is a painfully sharp indication\nthat prejudices are somehow being kept alive. The\nchildren of the world must not be exposed to this\ncriminal disregard for humanity. This era of change\nhas brought about a deep rooted desire for\ndemocracy. The campaign for freedom has become\na world wide effort. It is in this spirit that we must\nunite and put an end to prejudices once and for all.\nYours,\nAharyn M Ftootenberg.\n\n"

    "content": "A Clockwork Orange 2004\nTheatre\nThe novelist Anthony Burgess published his book A Clockwork Orange in 1962 and it caused quite a stir.\nCritics claimed then, as they do now, that violence\nin art causes violence in society especially amongst\nthe impressionable and less well educated-conveniently forgetting that the two orgies of violence\nin the first part of this century were not started by\nbooks, but by well educated politicians.\nStanley Kubrick made a film of the book, and the\nself-same critics slammed this on the same grounds.\nAs Kubrick was threatened with violence if he dared\nto show the film this shows an amusing degree of self-fulfilling prophecy.\nWell now we have the play of the old story of moral\nchoice versus the amoral white-coated scientist who\ndoesn't understand Beethoven.\nThe protagonist is 'little Alex', a fifteen year-old\nwho leads his 'd roo gs' on expeditions of rape and\nextreme violence. The teenagers speak an almost\ntotally incomprehensible dialect called 'nadsat' (from\nthe Russian 'teen' as in teenager) set in a framework\nof archaic and un syntactical English. They dress\nstrangely and are quite the separate little tribe. The\nviolence is arbitrary and purely for its own enjoyment.\nIndeed Alex gets churlish when one of his d roo gs suggests they steal some money. The choreography\nof the violence is excellent, although it avoids danger\nas the violence is more suggestive than graphic.\nThe most important part of the plot is the mental\nviolence inflicted on Alex by the authorities in their\nattempts to cure him. They succeed, so that the mere\nthought of violence makes Alex want to vomit. They\nalso make Alex unable to hear Beethoven without\nscreaming in agony as the treatment (a sort of\nPavlovian association technique) used Beethoven's9 th Symphony as backing. This leads Alex to attempt\nsuicide, with severe political repercussions for the\ngovernment who was responsible for implementing\nthe technique in the prisons.\nThe part of the play that had me transfixed by terror\nwas an exceptionally noisy part in which riot police\nbang plastic shields, dressed in nylon combat gear\nwith visors and crash helmets, invade the stage and\nbeat up a couple of revolutionaries preaching against\nthe government's increasingly authoritarian attempts\nto control violence with violence.\nThe sheer style of the production is overwhelmingly\ntwentieth century. The set looks like the inside of aga so meter painted bright red with sliding panels out\nof which props emerge and disappear.\nExept for the occasional pieces of Beethoven and\nBach, the music is based on the low, regular throb\noverlaid with intertwining synthesized chords [U2,\nThe Edge and Bono). This gives a very modern and\ndoom-laden atmosphere. There are also some rather\nMonkey Shines\nAlan Mann (Jason Beque), a student, gets up each\nmorning, leaving his beautiful leggy girlfriend in bed,\nputs several bricks in his rucksack and goes for a run,\nas one does.

This is no ordinary laboratory monkey, however,\nthis is one which Geof has been injecting with serum\nfrom human brain tissue to try and improve its\nintelligence, without much apparent success.

They\nwere demonstrating for the return of Australian artefacts now being held in the museum.

'Sometimes you wonder whether\nfinancial people's salaries should be better spent on college accommodation'\u2014Hamlet\nWarden, Matthew Bridgwater.\nNice one Malcolm!\nA recommended rent rise of 20% in\nHamlet Gardens has been strongly\ncontested by Mr Matthew Bridgwater,\nwarden of Hamlet Gardens. The increase\nwas suggested by Mr Malcolm Aldridge,\nSenior Assistant Finance Officer at IC,\nwho claimed that it was 'to balance the\nbooks' as last year's rent was set before\nthe recent rise in inflation. It was pointed\nout that Mr Aldridge failed to renegotiate\nrents in December as he was continually\nasked to.\nAccording to Mr Aldridge the rise was\nsuggested at 16%, and was based on an\naverage of the housing component of the\nretail price index (i.e. inflation values) and\nhousing costs in the country. The college\nnow have to recoup the losses of last year's failure to increase rents as much as\ninflation as well as increasing next year's rent according to inflation forecasts. Mr Aldridge stressed that the rise had yet to\nbe ratified by himself or Mr Tom Stevens,\nBusiness Manager of Residences, Mr John\nSmith, formerly College Secretary, or the\nRector.\nMr Bridgwater said that he had been\ncalled to see Mr Aldridge last Friday when\nhe had been informed of the proposed rent\nincreases for 1991, which he said were at\n20%. Mr Bridgwater said that he was\n'rather shocked at how big they were' and\nhad taken the figures to Neil McCluskey,\nIC Union President, who was 'equally\ndismayed'.\nMr Bridgwater said that on working\nthough Mr Aldridge's figures he\ndiscovered some forecasting errors that\namounted to several thousand pounds.\nThese invalidated the estimate of a20% rise. Mr Bridgwater said that the college\nwas charging, on average, \u00a352 per bed per\nweek, while the landlords who rent out the\nproperty to the college were charging the\ncollege an average of \u00a339 per bed per\nweek. This amounted to the students in\nHamlet Gardens paying the college\n\u00a380,000 per academic year.\nThe warden estimates that of this\nmoney, half will go towards covering the\nlosses of the summer letting scheme, a quarter will sub sid is e unoccupied rooms\nduring the year and a quarter will go\ntowards the 'dilapidation s account' which\nis a contingency against the landlords\ncharging the college for damage done to\nthe building during its head tenancy. In\neffect this means each student would be\npaying \u00a32.50 per week into this.account.\nThis follows the Lexham Gardens affair\nwhen the college had to pay \u00a38000 to the\nlandlords on returning the property to\nthem. Hamlet Gardens will be returned in\nthe next few years. Mr Bridgwater\nexpressed surprise that the college\n'suddenly thought to charge students' and\nsaid that he st on gly doubted whether the\nlandlords would charge the college as no\ndamage had been done.\nIn the Student Residence Committee\n(SRC) last Wednesday both Mr Bridgwater and Mr McCluskey challenged\nMr Aldridge, who was 'shot to bits' over\nhis figures.\nThe warden admits that Hamlet Gardens\nmust cut costs, by reducing the number\nof sub wardens by one and running a more\nefficient summer letting scheme. He said\nthat the increase should not to be above\n10%. He added that in his view the rents\nwere 'not unreasonable, but un competitive with no housing benefit and the poll tax\ncoming in.'\nHe ended by saying that 'sometimes you\nwonder whether financial people's salaries\nshould be better spent on college\naccommodation'.\n\n"

    "content": "Blatant Obscure Saving II\nDear Dave,\nI was distressed to read in last week's FELIX that\nthe Union's Postgraduate Affairs Officer (PGAO)\nMartin Gans has resigned. I am sure Martin cannot be\nblamed for the lack of interest in the Union by\npostgraduates, but I do not think the Academic\ninterests of 40% of the College should be left\nunrepresented. Until a new PGAO is elected I am\nwilling to make myself available to any postgraduate\nwishing to see me on academic matters. Admittedly\nthe problems faced by postgraduates are different to\nthe mainly undergraduate issues dealt with at\nAcademic Affairs Committee (AAC), but nevertheless\nthere is some overlap (and indeed the PGAO sits on\nthe AAC). I can be contacted through the pigeonholes\nin the Union Office or, from March 5th, in my office\n(Huxley room 654, ext 5780).\nAthos Ritsperis, Academic Affairs Officer.\nP.S. On the subject of the 'forged' Rachel Stone\nletter mentioned in last week's editorial \u2014I'm afraid\nit's happened again. With reference to the letter\nentitled 'Mr Zeebub replies' in last week's letters\nsection, if you check in Physics 1 you will find no\nlisting of aBL Zeebub.\nOther candidates standing for the sabbatical post of\nICU President at the time of going to press are:\nMr Doug King, Publications Board Chairman\nMark Orrow-Whiting, Physics 2.\nMs Jackie Scott, Welfare Officer\nMr Paul Shanley, UGM Chairman\nNot fair!\nDear Dave,\nIt is a sad fact that free speech is most definitely\nNOT alive and well at Imperial College.\nAt Monday lunchtimes, I put up several\nConservative Society posters along the walkway. The\nposters expressed an opinion on the ambulance\ndispute and advertised a forthcoming ConSoc meeting\nat which the topic is due to be discussed.\nWithin an hour, all but one of the posters had either\nbeen removed or had been ripped in two so that the\ncomplete message could not be read. Imagine my\nsurprise when I discovered that one of the posters had\nfound its way to Fiona Nicholas's desk in the Union\nOffice.\nWhilst the ConSoc posters were removed with\nremarkable speed, there have recently been many\nposters around College supporting the ambulance\nworkers which have not been taken down, although\nthey openly break ICU publicity rules because they are\nproduced externally and do not feature the name of\nan ICU society. Perhaps someone realised that the\nConSoc posters displayed a message which was too\nclose to the truth for comfort, so they were taken\ndown to prevent other people reading them.\nNow I don't object to other students producing\nlegitimate posters opposing Government policy\u2014\nindeed, I welcome the expression of an alternative\npoint of view. But I am against the blatant disobeying\nof Union rules-after all, what is the point of having\nrules if they are not enforced equitably?\nYours,\nMJ Hoskin, ICU Conservative Society Publicity\nOfficer.\nDear Dave,\nWith election time now upon us, and promises of\nworld-shattering changes to come, how does one find\nthe truth amongst the vain statements? It's a shame\nthat some people don't seem to remember what they\nsay in 'the heat of the moment', or even in the\nreasoned 'light of day'.\nEarly last term, a current ICU sabbatical made\ncertain statements about a person's behaviour at a CCU event. This comment was made, not in the heat\nof the moment, but approximately one week later, and\nsurely after reasoned thought. It would now seem that\nthis sabbatical would rather not be associated with\nthis statement, but would prefer to see it forgotten\nabout.\nNo one really expects candidates to keep all their\ncampaign promises, but a total change of heart does\nseem a little strange, especially as the comment was\nnot a rash one, at the time.\nLet's hope that this year's candidates and winners\ndon't suffer such turn around s, or perhaps give more\nthought to statements they make.\nName withheld on request\nSaving I Dear Dave,\nFirst may I congratulate you on printing Yve\nPosner's article last week on the Community Charge.\nI hope all this publicity and information will encourage\nstudents to register.\nIt is interesting to note that as the facts come out\nour opponents' accusations are proved false. Students\nwill actually gain from the Poll Tax.\nThe Welfare Office tells us that a typical student\npays \u00a35.25 in rates on \u00a350 rent per week, for a38 week yearly bill of \u00a3199.50. But under the Poll Tax,\nstudents in London will only pay about \u00a3100 (or \u00a339\nas the recently released figure for Westminster). How\ncan anyone complain that students are losing out?\nInstead of wasting time fighting the Poll Tax, ICU\nshould be informing students of how the laws enable\nthem to deduct the amount they pay in rates from\ntheir rent to their landlords. It's a disgrace that instead\nICU is telling students how to break the law and not\npay.\nLet's all thank Mrs T for saving us money!\nYours sincerely,\nDylan James, Maths 2.\nDylan James is proposing Thomas Wyatt for the\nsabbatical post of FELIX Editor.\nJackie Scott is proposing Chris Stapleton for the\nsabbatical post of FELIX Editor.\nDear Dave,\nI am writing in response to Ian McGovern's letter\nwhich appeared in last week's FELIX on the subject\nof students' fees.\nThe letter raises two very important issues:\n1. On what basis does the Imperial College Registry\ndecide the rate of fees payable by each student?\n2. Is Imperial College giving its students value for\nmoney?\nI was particularly c once rend about lan's experience\nin relation to the first question as it seems very\npossible that the College has made a mistake\nregarding the amount of fees he has been charged.\nI therefore feel that it is important to point out how\nthe decisions regarding fees are made and how they\ncan be challenged.\nIn deciding whether to charge a student the 'home'\nor 'overseas' rate of fees the College has to follow\nthe provisions of the Education (Fees and Awards)\nRegulations 1983. These provide that an educational\ninstitution must look at what a student has been doing\nduring the three years prior to the start of their course\nand decide whether they have a 'relevant connection'\nwith Britain. In order to have a 'relevant connection'\na person must have been 'ordinarily resident' in the\nUK for a full three years prior to the start of their\ncourse and secondly must show that at no time during\nthe three years they were here wholly or mainly for\nthe purpose of full-time education. It therefore follows\nfor example that if a student came to the UK primarily\nto study for ' A' Levels they would have to pay the\noverseas rate of fees.\nThese conditions seem very rigid but the\nRegulations do provide some important exceptions to\nthe three year rule and therefore it is well worth\nchecking out whether there is one that applies to you.\nIf so you would be in the position to request Registry\nto review the decision regarding the amount of fees\nyou have to pay.\nIn many cases Registry is not aware of the true\nfacts regarding a particular student and consequently\ncharge them incorrectly. I have advised several\nstudents on the question of fees and as a result they\nwere able to request a review of the a mont of fees\ncharged. So if you think you have been charged the\nhigher rate of fees in error then please come and see\nme. The Welfare Office is open Monday-Thursday\n12.30pm5.30 pm. The second issue is far less easily dealt with as it\ninvolves a very large number of complex factors upon\nwhich I do not feel it is appropriate for me to\ncomment. I do however hope that this will be the\nsubject of a future FELIX feature article.\nYve Posner, Welfare Adviser.\nMore Ash Poseur Dear Dave,\nA brand new topic for discussion in your paper can\nnow be opened: smoking. I would just like to ask why\nthere are no 'No smoking' signs in the refreshment\nareas of College\u2014especially the JCR and Main Dining\nHall. I know there are many smokers in the above\nplaces since I, like many others, prefer not to eat my\nmeals in a cloud of smoke.\nYours,\nSimon Reid, Mat Sci 1 (on behalf of the silent\nmajority).\nThe Editor,\nContrary to your article 16.2.90, last page, Vote\nVote Vote, the only candidate for the RCSU Academic\nAffairs Officer has the name Kevin Tilbrook, LSD 1,\notherwise known as 'Shades'.\nI am the candidate in question and was ratified for\nthe post at the hustings on Thursday 18 Feb.\nI would appreciate some rectification of this\nmistake, as this may lead to the misdirection of\ninternal mail.\nThanking you in anticipation,\nShades.\nPage 13\n\n"

The increase has not been\nconfirmed but is believed to be likely, following\ndiscussions between the Union and Mr Peter Mee,\nthe College Registrar, Students will receive 100%\nrefunds for travel within the London area and 60%\nrefunds for UK travel outside London.\nThe motion was passed without opposition after it\nwas amended to confirm that the refunds would not\nbe available if the Union's funding was not increased.\nElections were held for several posts. Ian Hodge\ndefeated Dave Bevan for the post of ICU Handbook\nEditor. The following were all elected unopposed:\nChris Tamdjidi as Phoenix Editor, Cathy Squires as\nICU Women's Officer, Jeremy Burnell as FELIX\nBusiness Manager and Suzanne Ahmet as ICU\nExternal Affairs Officer.\nThe next Union General Meeting will be the\nSabbatical Election Hustings on March 1st in the JCR\nat IC.\nPea-brained\nAn article in the Times Higher Education Supplement\n(THES) has highlighted Britain's brain drain by citing\nthe case of Professor Peter Bradshaw who left\nImperial College claiming that his department,\nAeronautics, was being run entirely for the benefit\nof other countries.\nProfessor Bradshaw is now working at Stanford,\nUniversity of California. He said that apart from the\nincrease in salary, his reasons for leaving the country\nwere the falling standards of PhD students and that\nthe government was gaining no economic benefit from\nthe department at all.\nProfessor Bradshaw is one of the 1600 signatories\nof a petition to the British Government from British\nscientists living abroad complaining of the\ngovernment's dismissal of the problem.\nThe Rector, Sir Eric Ash, said that in his view the\narticle was as critical of the college as of the\ngovernment. He said, in response to the article's claim\nthat the department was entirely made up of overseas\nstudents, that 'no Britons\u2014absolute nonsense'. He\nsaid that the tripling in salary that co-in cide s with\nworking in the United States probably played a part\nin academics' decisions.\nOn the subject of falling PhD standards Sir Eric\nsaid 'rubbish in my view....my PhD students were\nevery bit as good at the end of my time as the\nbeginning. Academics get the PhD students they\ndeserve.'\nProfessor P. Bearman, the present head of the\nAeronautics department, said that he considered the\narticle contained 'the personal views of Professor\nBradshaw ... I agree with the Rector\u2014if you don't get interesting topics or rush ahead in your field you\nwon't get interested students'.\nIn a letter to the THES, Professor Bearman\nexpressed surprise at Professor Bradshaw's belief that\nvirtually all PhD students were foreigners. He added\nthat the general tone of xenophobia in the article was\nunhelpful.\nImperial College Conservative society have\ncomplained to IC Union concerning the removal of\ntheir posters from around the college.\nThe A3 size posters sported the maxim 'Support\nthe ambulance workers let the patients die'. Four\nseparate groups of people registered their offence at\nthe posters to Ms Fiona Nicholas of ICU, who then\nallowed the posters to be removed. She said that the\nsociety should have checked with her beforehand, as\nshe would have expected that they would cause\noffence. 'If I had checked them, they wouldn't have\ngone up,' she said.\nConSoc have written a letter to Felix this week\nexplaining their position.\nUnion picket\nThe Imperial College Manufacturing, Science and\nFinance (MSF) Trade Union are to step up action in\ntheir protest over the potential redundancies of seven\nCollege staff.\nNext Thursday, they will be picketing outside a meeting of the College Management and Planning\nGroup, the highest policy making body in the college\nadministration which is chaired by the Rector, Sir Eric\nAsh. The IC MSF are calling on support from other\nLondon branches of the MSF for the picket and may\nalso be picketing outside the Sherfield building.\nMr Chris Stringer, chairman of IC MSF, said that\nthe decisions taken by emergency meetings of the\nMSF had been unanimously endorsed by an ordinary\nbranch meeting of the union on Wednesday. He added\nthat job offers had been made to some of the staff,\nbut that none of them had yet been accepted. He said\nthat the MSF 'cannot accept that any member should\nbe press uri sed into an unsuitable job or into taking\nearly retirement on unacceptable terms.'\nBroken trust?\nThe position of the Harlington Gravel Fund trustees\nis in doubt, following last Friday's meeting of the\nFinance and Executive Committee (F&E), College's highest financial decision making body.\nThe trustees, who are responsible for administering\nthe fund, were appointed prior to the terms of the trust\nbeing finalised and it is now unclear whether the brief\nfor the trust's expenditure is to be decided by the\ntrustees or by F&E. The difficulties in the trustees' position were\nhighlighted when the Rector, Sir Eric Ash, suggested\nthat the trust should contribute \u00a3% million to a residences appeal. This contradicts the terms of the\ntrust agreed by the trustees in December which have\nnot yet been approved by F&E. The trust is also in difficulties over the money to\nbe spent on an Astroturf pitch at Harlington, The\nscheme is being delayed because senior College\nofficials and the trustees feel that the quotes for the\npitch are unacceptable. Mr Neil McCluskey, IC Union\nPresident, is trying to obtain a specification for the\npitch so that new quotes can be sought.\nMr McCluskey said that he was 'committed to\ntrying to get it (the pitch) through this year' and that\nhe wanted to have it 'guaranteed that the pitch would\nbe ready by next October'. If the pitch is not available\nnext season, the ICU Hockey Club will be left without\na home ground. They are already unable to obtain\nexternal pitches for next season.\nThe papers for the sabbatical elections were stolen\nfrom the noticeboard on the staircase to the Union\nOffice last weekend. It is believed they were removed\nby students taking part in either the Hyde Park Relay\nor the Rag Monopoly event. The candidates who were\nstanding at the time have agreed that the theft does\nnot invalidate the elections.\nAll the sabbatical elections are now contested. At\n5.30pm yesterday, there were five candidates for the\npost of Union President: Doug King, proposed by Hal\nCalamvokis; Mark Orrow- Whiting, proposed by\nEdgar Denny; Athos Ritsperis, proposed by Alistair\nGoodall; Jackie Scott, proposed by Wendy Kite; and\nPaul Shanley, proposed by Andy Bannister.\nThere are two candidates for each of the other three\nposts. The candidates for Deputy President are Vijay\nThakur, proposed by Doug King, and Ben Turner,\nproposed by Dave Osborne. Ian Thomas, proposed\nby Paul McNaught, and Murray Williamson,\nproposed by Ralph Greenwell are standing for\nHonorary Secretary. The candidates for FELIX Editor\nare Chris Stapleton, proposed by Jackie Scott and\nThomas Wyatt, proposed by Dylan James.\nPapers will remain up until 5.30pm today.

Voting will be on Monday 5th and\nTuesday 6th March between 10am and 5pm in all\ndepartments. Students wishing to vote must produce\ntheir union card at the ballot box.\nCrackers!\nOver the weekend two students broke into the Union\nbuilding. Though no damage was done and nothing\nwas stolen, the burgle rs left a message stating that\n'You have been visited by the 'Pink Panther Soc' and\nhighlighting the lack of security in areas of supposedly\nhigh security.\nMr Terry Briley, security officer at I.C., said that\nhe considered the intentions of the two students\ninvolved, who are known and have been reprimanded,\nwere good but added that their actions were\n'thoughtless and irresponsible' considering the recent\nbreak-ins at the Union office. He said that their\nbehaviour had highlighted security faults and had\nfrightened Union staff.\nMr Briley said that steps will be taken to improve\nsecurity in the Union office but he was unable to\ndisclose details for security reasons.\nGreen party\nMr Neil McCluskey, IC Union President, was\nkidnapped by the Corleone faction of the Mafia last\nFriday. They cruelly tortured Mr McCluskey\nmistaking him for Alfonso Ambrosio, Brother-in-law\nof the last Pope, John Paul I. Mr McCluskey pleaded that he was not Italian, and\nhadn't even read 'The Godfather'. The sadists\ncontented themselves by covering Mr McCluskey in\nmedieval creme-de-men the after stealing his clothes.\nThey were stopped from stringing up Mr McCluskey\nfrom the Queen's Tower by the selfless action of the\nUnion Office staff who gave all their life savings to\nthe bala clave red bandits.\nThe Metropolitan police dismissed the episode as\n'utter stupidity'.\n\n"

    "content": "Film\nLeningrad Cowboys go America\nA frozen body lies on barren tundra. The body has a qui ff that stands out of foot from his head and pointed\nboots at least two foot long. In his hand he still\nclutches a bass guitar. He is a member of The\nLeningrad Cowboys. When their manager is informed\nthat the band should 'go America' where they will\n'swallow any kind of shit', the band set out at once,\nclutching only their instruments and a very little\nmoney. Once there they buy a huge old Cadillac and\nset off for Mexico (the only gig they can get), with\ntwo members in the boot and the bass player strapped\non the roof.\nLeningrad Cowboys Go America is the new film\nfrom Finnish filmmaker Aki Kaurismaki, starring real-life Finnish band The Leningrad Cowboys. Initially the\ndia lou ge is in Finnish, but as the Cowboys fly to\nAmerica they learn English allowing us to dispense\nwith the subtitles. Somewhat contrived perhaps, but\namusingly integrated into the film.\nThe plot itself is rather minimal. After the band\narrive in America, the film becomes a road movie as\nthey travel down America playing the occasional gig\nat various clubs and bars along the way. The action\nis interspersed with captions effect iv ly dividing the\nfilms into separate sections with titles like Beer\nQuestion and All You Need Is Love.\nThe humour is very deadpan and extremely off-beat, reminiscent of the films of Jim Jarmusch (who\nactually appears in a cameo role as a car salesman).\nVisual humour is used nicely throughout the film, from\nthe appearance of the cowboys themselves to scenes\nof them 'sunbathing' to make themselves more\nacceptable to the Americarl Public. Running gags also\nfeature, especially concerning tractors.\nMusic, not surprisingly, features heavily throughout\nthe film starting off with what is presumably fairly\ntraditional finnish music and then moving through a whole variety of styles, including heavy(ish) metal and\ncountry and western (The Ballad of Leningrad\nCowboys). I can't really comment on the musical\nquality of the film, but I don't see a Blues Brothers type\nsoundtrack emerging somehow.\nThis is certainly an unusual film, but probably one\nthat will only appeal to people with a certain (weird)\nsense of humour. Those who have it will find the film\nvery funny. Probably destined to become a cult film.\nLeningrad Cowboys go America is showing at The\nRenoir, Brunswick Sqr., nearest tube Russell Sqr. As\never with The Renoir if you go to the first (2.35)\nshowing and show your Union card you will get in for\n\u00a31.70 instead of \u00a34.00.\nAdam T. The Price\nTheatre\nIt is impossible to know what is important. But if you\ndo not decide what is important, or if your choice is\nwrong, time will not permit you another chance to\nchoose-you will have paid The Price-you will have\npaid or perhaps you will have been robbed.\nOn the verge of retirement from a stultifying job\nwith the city police, Victor is forced to confront his\npast in an uneasy auction, bidding to place av laue on\nhis stunted life. An easy-going procrastinator Victor\nis forced to return to the apartment where he lived\nin the shadow of a father impoverished and\npsychologically wrecked by the 1929 Stock Market\ncrash. The apartment block is being torn down. Victor\nhas invited a furniture dealer to quote him a price for\nthe contents, hoping to dispose of the lot before\ntaking adi satisfied wife to the movies for a rare treat.\nThe dealer Solomon has a wit and wisdom that\nentertains but his wiles begin to grate as he waffles\nhis way to a price that is more of a steal. The deal\nproves troublesome to close and the tension grows.\nAs finally the price seems set the past resurfaces\nagain as Victor's brother Walter arrives.\nWalter is not a man who undervalues himself.\nAlthough he insists that he doesn't want to interfere\nwith his brother's deal he soon asserts his own\nopinions on the worth of the goods. The differences\nin valuation soon uncover the the difference in values\nwhich underlie the brothers' estranging conflicts. The\npast is haemorrhaging out, its price is soon to be\ndiscovered.\nMiller's intention in The Price is to offer us a self-sacrificing idealist in Victor to contrast with the\ncynical but vital self-interest of his successful brother\nWalter. The play is of such mature construction\nthough that such simple judgements of character\nshould never be prompted by a faithful and skillful\nrealisation. Under David Thacker's direction just such\na skillful production is delivered.\nDriving Miss Daisy\n72 year-old Daisy crashes her new 1948 Packhard\ninto her neighbour's garden. Her son Boolie (Dan\nAkroydi, naturally concerned, imposes Hoke, a black\nchauffeur on her whom she bitterly resents. But as\ntime wears on, un surprisingly Daisy falls into a need-driven acceptance of Hoke and slowly an unusual\nfriendship develops between them. If you're waiting\nfor something momentous to happen then you may\njust as well be waiting for Godot; Daisy crashing her\ncar (and emerging unscathed) is about as action\npacked as it gets. But who needs Sylvester Stalone\nto make a good movie?\nDriving Miss Daisy is a gentle and delightfully funny\namble through 25 years of social change in the\nSouthern United States. This encompasses the period\nof the emerging Black Civil Rights Movement; Daisy's and Hoke's rel a tian ship developing in parallel with that\nof the southern white and Mack cultures. We hear the\nDavid Calder captures the nobility of the 'weaker'\nman in a great performance as Victor that gives him\nboth sympathy and strength. Playing to this strong\nlead Bob Peck's Walter manages a degree of sy meter y sufficient to smooth the stereotypical edge of the all-American brother. Alan MacNaughton finds a nice key\nfor Solomon, letting the dry Jewish humour tickle\naway in the first act and Marjorie Yates inhabits her\nrole as Victor's wife with professional measure.\nThanks to Joan Washington's coaching the Stateside\naccents seem to have stuck convincingly. (Just as\nwell when playing to a house of more than half\nAmericans.)\nA measured production of a mature play destined\nfor growing stature. Best suited to the humanly rash\nand the seriously sentimental.\nMAC.\nFilm\nvoice of Martin Luther King but never run into any\nnigger-lynching prejudice as shown in such films as\nMississippi Burning. But it's also a visual study of that\nera with clever period touches ranging from wide\nlapels (very forties) through a rich selection of vintage\ncars to a token jogger at the end of the film in 1873.\nJessica Tandy gives a sterling performance as Miss\nDaisy, ably supported by Morgan Freeman as Hoke.\nAnd it makes a change to see Dan Akroyd (of\nGhostbusters notoriety) looking like Helmut Kohl.\nA pleasing if emotionally stagnant film which didn't quite drive me to my wo d ge of kleene x.

The Japanese\ntelecommunication company Nippon Telegraph and\nTelephone (NTT) sent digital data a distance of\n2,223km without using electrical repeaters.\nThe attenuation of optic fibre means that amplifiers\nare required periodically along the length of the cable\nto boost the signal. Previously these have been\nelectrical, that is, the light pulses are converted to an\nelectrical signal, amplified then transformed back to\nlight. Such repeaters are prone to failure and costly,\nparticularly for lines in awkward environments, for\ninstance, on the sea bed.\nDifferent means of building repeaters are being\ninvestigated. One method uses the rare earth element,\nerbium, and keeps the signal in the optical domain\nthroughout. The NTT record was set using 25 of these\nrepeaters which each form a section of the line 160km long being separated by 80km. \u2022 Orthopaedic surgeons may soon be able to install\nbetter fitting replacement knee and hip joints with the\nhope that they will function for many years longer\nthan present renewals. A new computer system will\nenable the surgeon to view the joint from all angles\nallowing rehearsal of the operation and joints to be\ntailor-made. Today's replacement hips for example,\nrarely last for more than a decade due to joint\nloosening or the implant breaking as loads on the body\nalter; bone can gradually grow and adjust. The present\nfitting system involves choosing a standard size\nreplacement joint after comparing the X rays of the\nbones with different sized templates.\n\u2022 Genetically engineered mice that have a human\nimmune system are now being used to test new AIDS\ndrugs. HIV, the virus responsible for the disease, does\nnot effect many species and chimpanzees have had\nto be used for experiments which are rare and\nexpensive. The virus only affects those parts of the\nmice which are of human origin but it is hoped to\nprovide new insight into the disease, if only for\nensuring that a new drug has no anti-viral effects\nbefore further tests are carried out.\n\u2022 Mute swans in Britain have been dying more than\never in recent years after having been poisoned by\nlead. This is due to the swan swallowing shotgun lead\npellets or lead weights discarded by anglers, which\nare now banned. The lead accumulates in the body\nand causes weight loss, muscular paralysis and a reduced resistance to disease leading to the inevitable\ndeath of the swan.\nA recent report suggests that results from 'chal ation therapy' are encouraging with 49% of poisoned\nswans being apparently successfully treated although\nonly 22% survived for more than two years. The\ntreatment involves injecting the swan two or three\ntimes a day with sodium calcium ede tate for at least\na week, this combines with the lead rendering it\nharmless. Side effects such as mineral deficiencies\nthough are not well quantified yet, however.\n\u2022 Plug 'Food Irradiation'.

Artist's impression of the Ulysses launch from\nOf all human exploits space exploration must surely\nrank in the forefront for firing our imagination and\nsense of adventure. Now as we enter the '90s a new\nera of solar system exploration is dawning where,\ncompared with the lean times of the '80s in which\nmissions were few, the future once again looks bright\nwith a flotilla of sophisticated space probes set to\nembark upon exciting voyages to different reaches of\nthe solar system. Indeed there is every prospect that,\nto paraphrase Neil Armstrong's famous words when\nsetting foot on the moon, these 'small steps' will lead\nto 'giant leaps' in knowledge and human achievement.\nIn this article I describe the solar system space\nmissions already approved for the '90s, highlighting\nthe important role which Imperial College scientists\nare set to play. Imperial involvement centres on\ninvestigating the behaviour of plasmas and magnetic\nfields in solar system space, especially those\nprocesses which are relevant to the universe.\nFirst, though, it is right to question the.reasons for\nconducting expensive space exploration when there\nare so many pressing human problems here on Earth.\nTo my mind, such highly technological scientific\npursuits are vital for intellectual and national vigour;\nif worthwhile intellectual challenges are absent\nstagnation soon sets in. What greater intellectual\nchallenge can exist than to understand the region of\nspace in which we live and which we may eventually\ncolonise? The analogy with Columbus is allied to this\nargument for if he had not sailed, progress would\ncertainly have been delayed. There is every reason to\nbelieve that practical benefits for humankind will also\ncome from exploring the solar system. Last but\ncertainly not least, solar system exploration offers\nperhaps the best opportunity for forwarding\ninternational collaboration and detente.\nDuring the '90s new exploratory missions are\nconfirmed or planned to every planet in the solar\nsystem and to several asteroids and comets. This\nexciting programme includes fly-by s, orbiters,\natmosphere probes, balloons, landers, rovers and\nthe Space Shuttle later this year. Courtesy of ESA sample return missions. The table lists those missions\nalready approved.\nThe new era of solar system exploration began last\nyear with the successful launches of the Magellan and\nGalileo spacecraft (the first NASA planetary missions\nin over a decade). Magellan is targeted to Venus,\nEarth's hostile sister planet, which it will reach on\nAugust 10, 1990. It will perform detailed scanning at\nvarious wavelengths of the Venusian atmosphere and\nsurface, looking for deep cloud patterns, lightning,\nvolcanoes and evidence of plate tectonics. Later this\nmonth Venus will also be visited by the Galileo\nspacecraft, probably the most sophisticated robotic\nprobe yet flown. This encounter will be followed by\ntwo Earth flybys to speed Galileo's passage to Jupiter\nwhich it will reach in December 1995. There it will\nrelease an atmosphere probe, undertake detailed\nmeasurements of the swirling atmosphere, giant\nmagnetosphere (ten times the Sun's diameter) and\nenergetic radiation belts, and perform a complex tour\nlasting twenty months, of the numerous moons of\nJupiter. Many will recall the stunning Voyager\nphotographs of the Jupiter system; but these could\npale into insignificance when compared with the\ndefinition achievable on Galileo which will rival that\nof Landsat pictures of cloud cover over the Earth's surface. Without question many significant\ndiscoveries will follow. Of special interest to Imperial\nworkers is Jupiter's volcanic moon, lo. Intense electric\ncurrents flow between lo and Jupiter's outer\natmosphere which cause fluctuation in the intensity\nof radio waves emitted from Jupiter's vicinity. Imperial\nhas been in the forefront for proposing models for the\norigin and structure of these currents and radio\nemissions, and Galileo will provide unique data for\ntesting these theories when it flybys lo at about 1000\nkm.\nIn October this year the pioneering Ulysses mission\nwill be launched (figure 1) to fly over the poles of the\nSun in a unique journey lasting over four years.\nUlysses will be the first probe to explore our solar\nPage 8\n\n"

The foi lists then\nhad an uphill struggle against a stony Southampton\nteam-notable exceptions being a50 victory each for\nPeter and Simon. Two narrow 5-4 victories in the foil\nmeant that IC were 13-5 going into the e pee, needing\njust one more fight to secure an overall win.\nUnfortunately, the Epeeists were rather lacking in the\nspirit and style which made them so successful last\nyear, and a27 defeat in the e pee meant that IC won\nthe match overall by 15-12.\nTeam\nSabre: Marucie Ricou, Nick Hills, Dave Matthews\n(Capt).\nFoil: Gully Burns, Nick Hills, Simon Laight (Res.

The foi lists were also under\npressure, with Bradford performing to their highest\nstandard, and again IC narrowly won 5-4. After\nIP* winning the first two e pee fights, IC were 13-7 and\nthe result sem ed certain; however, severe equipment\nproblems meant that Peter and Nick faced the virtually\nimpossible task of fencing left-handed with right-handed orthopaedic grip weapons. Gully Burns was\nunlucky to be narrowly defeated in two fights, and the\nnightmare slowly unfolded as Bradford, gaining in\nconfidence all the time crept back to draw level at\n13-13.

The lads dominated the\nfirst half, and when one of Mary's defenders decided\nthat they needed two goalkeepers (nicely punching\nthe ball away), we expected to take the deserved lead\nfrom the following penalty. But, up stepped twinkle\ntoes Sanga to limply paddle the ball towards the goal,\nensuring a spectacular save from the keeper (although\nno motion was necessary on his part).\nNot deterred by this, the 6th s kept up the pressure\nand, after a good run down the right, Nick managed\nto hit the far post with one of his 'better' crosses. The\nsecond half began tamely but after ten minutes the\nopposition broke through to score a scrappy goal. The\n6th s responded well with some good play up front,\nalthough this was not reflected in the defence who,\nafter mis-controlling the ball several times conceded\na second goal.\nIC struck back almost immediately as super sub\nSmith scored superbly after a good run from a midfielder. Phil, anxious to restart, decided to pretend\nthat he was one of the opposition and take the kickoff himself, without success. This diffused the\nsituation as the game ended without further incident,\nalthough a mass of opposition supporters invaded the\npitch at full-time whilst ours were already in the ale\nhouse drowning their miseries.\nGoldsmiths 2 IC Dribblers 2\nLast week saw our valiant heroines battling in wet and\nwindy Chingford where we held London Hospitals to\na30 defeat. It was so cold, miserable and unexciting,\nI didn't bother writing about it.\nIt was quite a relief this week when we saw the sun\nshining over Albany Park. Somehow we'd managed\nto arrive over an hour early for the match and whilst\ndeciding how best to occupy our time, one bright-eyed\nDribbler spotted a nearby hostelry. The debate over,\nwe de scene d on the Sunday lunchtime drinkers at Ye\nOlde White Crosse Inne for a wee dram or two of the\namber nectar (purely for medicinal reasons-the hair\nof the dog I think it's called!).\nThe first half of the game saw a rather shocked pack\nof Dribblers concede two goals after spending far\nmore time than usual in the opposition's half. We\nmanaged to draw even in the second half thanks to\ntwo stunning goals (modesty forbids me from saying\nwho scored) and were unlucky not to win with several\nother shots either being saved or going wide. The real\nheroine of the day though, must be Lucy who flung\nher right breast and throat in the way of a last ditch\nattempt by Goldies. Suffice to say, the game over,\nthe Dribblers then got down to the serious business\nof the day and had a few drinks and sang a few\nsongs-oh! and annoyed a few BR passengers as well!\nThe British University Sports Federation (BUSF) Judo\nChampionships were held in Glasgow on February 10\nand 11.
