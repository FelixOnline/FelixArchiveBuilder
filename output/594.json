    "content": "CLUBS AND SOCIETIES\nSF Soc\nThis is the SF Soc bulletin, mark 2. Mark 1 was\nread over my shoulder by the Soc Sec, who\ndidn't like it so here's the new improved, nice\nin off esn ive meally mouthed soft version with\nno integrity whatever. I'm not proud. It's a hard life being a script droid. Droid. There's a word. Droid. Can't say I like it. Droid. No, it\ndoesn't grow on me. I prefer replica nt myself.\nOh d rok. The only things I have to say I'm not\nallowed to. So, if any readers feel the influence\nof some strange psychic force, it's me trying to\nget in touch. My goodness those burst arteries\nhurt.\nNewsflash: Arthur C. Clarke in movie-stardom bid. Yes folks in the new film Village\nin the Jungle, the well-known author plays the\npart of (a?) judge. SF meets Bloomsbury.\nWhat can we expect to follow this? Thomas\nDisch in Saturday Night Fever \u2014II? Ian\nWatson in the remake of Fame is the Spur?\nHarlan Ellison in Annie? That joke died quickly\ndidn't it? Is there some st ange significance to\nthe fact that Blakes 7 the Scorpios transporter\nwill only transmit people into clay pits and their\nguns make people jump into puddles? That\nAvon is always shot against a white background when he says \"yes\"? That he also\ngets struck on the back of the head three times\nin every episode? Those last two sentences\nweren't actually sentences by the way, unless\nof course you're American.\nNow, a message for all our readers who\nhappen to be tr if fids. Tok tok tok thump pok\npok tok clatter thump. Oh I forgot, tr if fids can't read- (at least, not without moving their\nstamens). Ah well, time to turn, can't write any\nmore for personal reasons which I'd rather go\ninto right now. Life's like that. So long and\nleave it to George.\nThe Cat, the Rat, the Dog and the medium-sized Bear who lives in the woods.\nTM\nWhat's all this then? Some mystical mum bo jumbo? Some Eastern religion?

During our two hour\nvisit we saw part of the new serial Tenco being\nrehearsed: Dr Who was also in operation, but\nTop of the Pops seemed to be having a permanent tea-break (we tried to see that\ntwice!).\nWe saw the view a newscaster has whilst\nreading the news, and also visited one of the\ninfamous BBC restaurants for a very welcome\ncup of tea.\nAltogether we had a very interesting and\ninformative visit, coming away with information\non jobs, tele text, ways of obtaining tickets to see\nproductions being filmed, and how to work out\nwhich radio channel plays what.\nTrampoline\nIC Trampo Club is alive and well, in spite of\nbeing cut out of last week's FELIX. We meet\nevery Wednesday from 5:30pm at Queen Elizabeth's College, Campden Hill Rd (just off\nKensington High Street).\nBeginners are always welcome\u2014meet at\nBeit Arch at 5:00pm if you want to be shown\nthe way there, or contact Kristen Hansen,\nChem2 or Fiona Sinclair, Aero PG.

See\nyou then!\nCaynor\nCypriots unite!\nThis article has two main objectives: to remind\nIC students of the Cyprus problem and to\ngenerate interest in formation of a Cyprus\nSociety in the IC Union.\nThe invasion of our 'island of love' is now\nover seven years old. Time, said to be a healer,\nhas in our case merely increased the\ninter communal mistrust and deepened the\nwounds of the displaced people, the relatives\nof the missing persons and generally of all\npeace loving Cypriots Greek, Turkish, Maronit, Armenian and Latin.\nSince antiquity, our homeland has been\ndominated by different influences; this has\nenabled a rich cross-fertilization of cultures\nand a Cypriot identity and character has\ndeveloped. However, recent history is\nthreatening our culture and society.\nWe, as students and young citizens can help\nto promote our culture and identity by forming\na national society to cater for our social,\ncultural and national needs.\nAll interested students and staff, come to\nSouthside Refectory on Tuesday, November 3\nbetween 12:30 and 2:00pm, or sign name and\naddress on poster in Junior Common Room.\nPlease come to discuss, suggest or\nparticipate.\nCommunity\nAction Group\nAs usual the soup run is on Tuesday and\nFriday,10:30 pm, Falmouth Kitchens, transport available back to Evelyn G dns.

Also St\nPancras Hospital are asking for volunteers to\nhelp with elderly patients in various activities,\nwatch out for details in FELIX and posters\nround College.\nFirstly a correction to my last article. OK, I admit it, I cocked it up. The\nGeneral Committee Meeting is on Tuesday not Monday because (wait\nfor it) I'm going to a dinner on the Monday.\nAnyway, General Committee is the policy making body of RCSU and\nconsists of all officers and reps. Anybody, however, can attend. So please\ncome along (ask your reps where and when).\nOn Saturday last, fifty-seven people from RCS turned out to play\nMonopoly around London. Congratulations to the 'Chemcoats' team,\noverall winners, and to the 'Mug and Glass' learn who were runners-up.\nOur final total was about \u00a3200, which may not seem much, but if you\nwent out lo enjoy yourself rather than to collect, which is the best\nmethod, gaining \u00a34 each and having fun is a good result.\nAnyway, this brings our overall Rag total to about \u00a31,150 for this year\nThere is no Rag stunt this weekend, but instead we have the draw of the\nfirst RCS Rag Raffle, at noon on Saturday in the RCSU Office. So today\nis the last day of ticket sales, except from me. Nex! week however,\nNovember 7, there will be the next stunt, so look out for details.\nThe next Broadsheet will be produced on Wednesday, if you want to\nsee it out before Christmas Steve probably needs help that afternoon.\nOn Thursday. November 5, Guy Fawkes, etc., Simon is organising a trip to the Lewes Carnival to watch the barrel races and fireworks\ndisplay.

    "content": "Dear Mr Smith\nI feel it necessary to correct\nyou on a few facts about the\nMontpelier Street situation mentioned in your editorial last week.\n\u2022 The Exec did take steps to\ninvestigate the situation. It\nwould seem that FELIX is\nguilty of lack ol investigation since nobody asked us if we\nhad done anything about it. It\nalso seems that FELIX had taken something of a sensationalist in its reporting. The problems with the Hall seem\nto comedown to a lack of\nelectricity sockets in many rooms and a lack of hot water in the bathrooms. The balance ol the problems reported existed only for a day or two,\nif at all. The lack of electricity and hot water has meant the residents of Montpelier have indeed asked for a rent rebate.\nI will attempt to keep you more informed of how this\nrequest is progressing. It is not true that the position in Montpelier would not have come to the attention of the Exec if it had not been\nin FELIX. It would and it\nhas, as is shown by the fact\nIam mote aware of the real situation than yourself. Furthermore, an inaccurate article in FELIX has prejudged the issue as the College immediately has a basis for\ndefence.\nFinally, my thanks to the\nEstates Section who performed miracles; with an old shell of a house in a period of only six\nweeks. There were bound to\nbe teething problems and the\nFLxec will naturally offer residents all the help they\nneed during this initial period. \u00bb\nTours sincerely\nXi ck Morton Dear Sir\nI wholeheartedly agree with your comment in FELIX regarding the tardiness ol our Executive Officers in doing something about the new Hall in Monte peli er Street. Unfortunately this isn't the only example of their apathy. Why were n't any of them on the\nC ND march on Saturday? Credit is due to the 150 or\nso students who marched under the Imperial College Union banner but can they\nreally be expected to continue their indubitably sensible cause without the support ol\nthe Executive? Leaving aside\nthe fact that the Union passed\na motion last session strongly\nsupporting C ND and the argument that because of that\nmotion they should be at least\nmorally bound to partake inC ND activities, surely at least\none of them has credence in the aims of the organisation and the conviction to do something about them. Or perhaps the Executive just\nthink sCN Dan unfortunate accident that happened to the\nUnion, something to be swept\nunder the mat.I hope not!\nTours sincerely\nMichael J. Mac Clancy Dear Mark\nIn the li rst issue of Forward\nthis session, the Chairman of IC Liberal Club advocated that ICU should rejoin NUS. Here I would like to answer a few of his points.\nThe first is the e pies tion of\nlegal, welfare, and financial advice which MrNa than supposes NUS provides; sadly, they seldom provide much advice which is not readily publicly available; personal enquiries to End sleigh Star c likely to be\npushed around from one extension to another, a query from a college (or \" constituent member\" to use the jargon) even if backed up by a motion at conference, will probably be \" looked into\", or\nput less vaguely, shelved until the Exec member has moved on, and it's someone else's problem.\nFurther to all this \u2014 with the \u00a315,000 or so we save, we\nare in a position to take on people like Michael Arthur( admittedly now employed by\nCollege) and finance some legal work, for example the\n\" ordinary residence\" problem two years ago.\nPlacing touched on the \u00a3 1 5 , 0 0 0 or so it would cost us\nto join, I ask MrNa than where he proposes to lind the\nmoney? College, faced with a shrinking budget of their own are likely to deny us the money as a supplement to our present budget, and will back their arguments by asking\" If you' ve managed without NUS for the past four years,\nwhy do you need it now?\" So: the money would need\nto come straight from the Union's present budget. This\nwould not mean a10% drop in clubs' budgets, as is cosi ly hinted, but taking lix ed costs\ninto account( sabbaticals, stall\nsalaries, etc.) would result in a2025% drop in the finances of\neach and every Union club or\nsociety, a proposal few of their treasurers would relish.\nWhether one believes in changing NUS from inside\nor out, the simple truths are\nthat we have managed pretty well so far without NL IS' s services, we can'tal lord NUS, we aren't big enough to change its politics, and it is\nthe best interests of all IC students for us to campaign to\nkeep ICU out of NUS. Chris Webb\nSir\nUpon reading Monsieur Gharb age's review of the ENTS gig, we wonder whether he will be turning his attention to even more important over sights at Imperial College. These induce Porsche924 s and Rolls Royce s for ICU transport, rooms in the more impressive London hotels for\nall IC students, a FELIX video package to replace the\noutmoded concept of news-print and even( with all the\nmoney remaining) a1 ew mercury artesian BORES for\nthe Hg Wells Soc (ha ha!).\nToms\nB v ll Waterson Paul Beli'ord\nP S:Now we know from where the NME get their inimitable style!!\nDear Mark\nIam writing to in form your readers of an odious little man who' s trying to blackmail Guilds Union. I shall refer to\nhim as Mr X as he does not\nwant his name associated with I CRag. Mr X is threatening not to organise Guilds Carnival in Rag Week because he\nobjects to the \" anti IRA\" jokes in this year's Rag Mag:I think he' s worried about possible IRA retribution because of these jokes. This is\nperhaps surprising because,\nI've heard, he' san IRA sympathiser himself!! It is my opinion, and I hope your readers agree with me, that\nshould Mr X not want his\nname associated with the charitable cause of I CRag, then he should cease to promote his own name. Iam fully prepared to help him in this. If he still wants to organise Guilds Carnival, then let him do it anonymously. II this mean thinks his views are so important then let'shear him speak to IC Union. I hope Guilds Union won't sit\nby and let Mr X get away with this sneaky, self promoting conceited act. Someone else can organise Carnival, but they must take it over now, not wait till Mr X has\ngot them by the Balls (so to\nspeak) and it's too late.\nTours, extremely pissed off\nBarney McCabe Dear Mark\nIn FELIX593 FVa nk James claims that the implications of the statement by Robert Kelsey( FELIX592) that\" the majority of socialists are\nnot power crazed dictators in the making\" is that a minority arc. This is useful to realise\nthat a majority ol all politicians are power crazed dictators in the making, it's by no means necessary to be socialist.\nWe agree with James advice that \" one must exercise\nindependent critical judge-ment of the motives of people such as ( Tony) Benn.\"Y et wear c puzzled as to why he has\nfailed to follow his advice. We ask James to justify\n( with facts) the assertion that\nTony Benn would like to see\nthis country run by the Russians. Continued on fri ge fi no. Page 2 FELIX, October 30, 1981\n\n"

If you\nhave any interesting snippets for me, then\ndrop a note into the FELIX Office or see\nthe Editor. He'll pass anything on\n(complete anonymity assured, of course!).\nKnickers to the DP!\nEverybody in the Union seems to have souvenirs left behind by their predecessors.\nMr Smith tells me that the great South\nAmerican explorer left behind a lovely cassette\ntape entitled Sounds of Sex, presumably to\nkeep the incoming editor interested during\nlong nights alone in the office.\nBut devi an cy seems to have reached greater\nheights in the IC Union Office. Deputy President Barney McCabe discovered a charming colour brochure in his bottom drawer entitled \"Fantasy Fashions from East\nof Eden\" which Rachel Snee had (carelessly?)\nforgotten about. From the amount of time Mr McCabe has spent thumbing the glossy\ncatalogue it is not certain whether he is-shocked or expecting his lure x stockings! to\narrive at any moment!\nLiving off the cream ; \u2022 *\nThe legacy of last year seems to have affected\nthe residents of 1 Wharfedale Street too.\nIt seems that the current residents were\nrudely awoken one morning by an irate\nmilkman, who wanted to discover the present\naddresses of the previous occupants of the\nEarl's Court flat.

There could be no better\nexample than Senior Warden Don( Kermit)\nMonro.\nOn discovering that one of the new inmates'\nof Weeks Hall listed \"Rock music, motorbikes\nand playing guitar\" as his interests, he was\nkeen to meet the hapless fresher. As the new\nresident climbed off his machine, wiped the\ngrease from his hands and removed his helmet\nDon leapt forward with a welcoming gesture:\n\" Hi,I 've been dying to meet you. You're\ninterested in everything I'm not!\" he quipped.\nUnderneath the arches\nThe Deputy President has discovered a new\nmethod for controlling the rowdy masses who\nroll out of the Union Bar late at night. His room\nis positioned directly above Beit Archway and\non a recent occasion he tested his brilliant\nidea. By becoming brainless ly drunk himself\nand leaning over the balcony he found he\ncould empty the contents of his stomach onto\nthe unsuspecting masses below with surprising\naccuracy.\nThe only fault is that, more often than not,\nhe is at the head of such crowds himself.\nQ Sailing\nThe IC team sailed over last weekend for the\n\"Foot Team. Racing Trophy\" at the Welsh\nHarp. This event is organized annually by\n\"Castaways\" and attracts a number of very\nstrong teams from around the country.\nAs racing started it soon became clear that\nIC was lacking the experience ol some ol the\nclub teams and lost to very good teams from\nHollingworth Lake SC and Laleham SC, eventual winners and runners up in the\ngroup IC were sailing in.\nTo their credit the team beat all university\nstyle teams.

    "content": "A case for disarmament\nin United Nations disarmament week\nwe invited the IC CND Group to state\ntheir views\nSaturday, October 24 saw upwards of 200,000 people gather in London\nto demonstrate their concern for the escalating arms race and the\ndeployment of vast numbers of nuclear weapons in Europe by both\nNATO and Warsaw Pact countries. This occured in the wake of a demonstration of 300,000 in Bonn, and in parallel with one of 300,000 in\nRome. The following day marked the beginning of the United Nations\ndisarmament week, and saw further record-breaking demonstrations in\nParis and Brussels. So, why this dramatic European-wide movement of\npublic opinion against the defence policies of both superpowers and the\ncountries of NATO? Since World War II, world politics has been increasingly dominated by\nthe power struggle between the USA and the USSR. This conflict of interests has\" generated an unrelenting Cold War and arms race which have\ngained renewed momentum. \"Overkill\" has been possessed by both sides\nsince the early 1960s, thus invalidating the concept of deference as an\nexplanation for the arms race. The Reagan administration has reiterated\nthe condition of US military superiority prior to any negotiation on\nmultilateral arms reduction. A condition which, when paralleled by the\nUSSR, produces an absurd paradox resulting in nothing more than the\nescalation of nuclear weapons, and a situation where nuclear war is now\na probability. A probability further enhanced by the likelihood of a computer or systems failure firing a weapon by accident. In 1980 alone\nthere were three reported cases of serious faults in the computers that\ncontrol the launch of NATO nuclear weapons.\nReagan has chosen to adopt the tactics of confrontation, involving\nmassive increases in defence expenditure and the death of detente. His\ncontroversial statement to New York editors was only a blunt\nre affirmation of the present willingness of both superpowers to envisage a\" limited\" nuclear war fought in the European\" theatre\". Further willingness is illustrated by the adoption of Presidential Directive 59, and\nthe plans for installing Pershing II and Cruise missiles in Europe, both\ninitiated by the Carter administration. Reagan's stamp of approval was\nadded by the endorsement of the MX missile program, and the\ninsensitive announcement of the revived neutron bomb program on\nHiroshima day. The British government has played its part by agreeing to\nsite one hundred and sixty Cruise missiles on its soil, in full knowledge\nthat they will be entirely under US control. Furthermore the government\nhas chosen to update our own \"independent deterrent\" by the purchase\nof four Trident submarines at a cost of \u00a36,000m.A policy which, if\ncontinued, might result in a further cost of \u00a317.000m for the newer\nTrident II system.\nPresent NATO policy allows for a nuclear war to be fought in the\nEuropean \"theatre\"\u2014but whatever the level of such a war, Britain's concentration of military targets makes its destruction certain. The UK government is clearly prepared to persuade people that a nuclear war is\nnot only think able but sur viv able. The civil defence measures outlined in\n'Protect and Survive' are farcical, and must not be allowed to placate a worried population.\nThis situation has been reached despite \" multilateral\" arms negotiations dating from the 1950s. The culmination of these, SALT2, still allows a5070% rise in the number of deliverable strategic warheads\nbefore 1985 (SIPRI), and SALT2 has not been ratified in the US. Multilateral negotiations so far have not been a waste of effort. Any\nagreement is useful, but their effect on the arms race has been marginal.\nThis does not mean that we should despair and await the holocaust. We\nmust analyse why they failed and then find an alternative approach.\nC ND propose that Britain should work within Europe to bring about a European Nuclear Free Zone, the first steps which would be the decision\nto ban Cruise and stop the Trident programme, followed by the ;em oval of all US military bases. It is important to regard C ND's proposals as a process of disarmament, and not a naive step into the unknown.\nThe belief that the Communists are poised to overrun the \"Free\nWorld\" has been repeated time and again throughout the past thirty-five\nyears until it is now widely accepted. Similar statements, with the roles\nreversed, are being fed to the people in the Communis! countries. The\nUSSR would be unable to (and why should they particularly want to?)\nsweep across a defenceless Europe. The Warsaw Pact's supposed\nsuperiority in conventional forces is aqa in something which doesn't bear\nscrutiny. The numbers game which is played here is misleading,\nparticularly in view of the deliberate decision of NATO countries to opt\nfor efficient, highly sophisticated hardware, as opposed to the (larger\namount of) comparatively basic weapons of the Warsaw Pact. People\nmust now start to think for themselves. The history of the arms race has\nbeen a history of lost (or often, carefully avoided) opportunities.\nSomeone must take the first step. Britain has one of the largest\nconcentrations of nuclear bases, missiles, and weapon support establishments in the world. It must scrap ALL nuclear weapons and\nbases, and refuse to co-operate with any NATO nuclear strategy. The\nDutch and Belgians have already refused Cruise. Canada has refused all\nnuclear weapons.\nThere is a large movement building up in Britain supporting unilateral\ndisarmament: church organisations, trade unions, the Labour Party,\nlarge sections of the Liberal Party, the Ecology Party, and a mushrooming of C ND and END local groups. The movement is\nattracting large numbers of individuals of different backgrounds and\nbeliefs, all of whom share the conviction that the present trend must be\nreversed. In time of unemployment, cuts, low investment, and terrible\nneed in the Third World (see the Brandt Report), it is appalling that\nresources are devoted to nuclear weapons. It is essential to start the\nsteps to survival now. Time is running out.\nIC CND Group\nFELIX, October 30, 1981 Page 9\n\n"

Anyone wishing to stand for any\nof these posts should put their names up on\nthe papers in the Union Lower Lounge and\ngain the requisite number of second ers to be\neligible for election.\nPublicity Officer\nThe Union Publicity Officer's most important\nduty is designing, producing and distributing\nposters for ICU General Meetings. Secondary\nto that is the advertising of other Union activites such as marches, demonstrations,\nparties. Southside Shoo, etc. Apart from\nproducing posters the UP O will also be\nexpected to produce adverts for FELIX and fly\nsheets occasionally.\nThere are three meetings per term on\naverage so the work involved is not excessive\nbut the job is very important in that it a meeting is not advertised then people will not\nturn up to it, plain and simple. The job is not\ntechnically difficult because all the UP O has to\ndo is produce the artwork and hand it in to\nFELIX and they do the rest. So all that is\nrequired is a bit of imagination and the ability\nto get ideas down on paper.\nUnion Finance Committee\nThere are two vacant posts on Union Finance\nCommittee.\nThe objects of the committee shall be:\nThe committee shall investigate and give\nadvice on the finances of Imperial College\nUnion( consideration, drawing up, and recommendation of estimates to Council), and\nshall administer a fund, contributed to\nannually by the Council, for capital expenditure\non equipment.\nAll clubs and societies grants have to be put\nto Finance Committee for approval and throughout the year all claims for equipment to\nbe bought or extra money needed for societies\nhas to be applied for through the Union Finance Committee. This is a chance for\nanyone with a bent towards money and financial matters to get involved with the\nallocation of the Union grant to the areas they\nthink most deserving this year.\nImperial College Community Action Group\nThere are two vacancies for ordinary members\nof ICCA G. \"The group shall have for its objects the\npromotion ot student awareness and involvement in programmes of community\nservice and action of all kinds\". ICCA G help in\nmany areas such as evening soup runs to\nCharing Cross to feed the homeless, helping\nout on Saturday mornings in clubs for mentally\nhandicapped children, taking part in shows at\nlocal hospitals and building adventure playgrounds on council estates. Only a few\nhours of work need be put in each week but\nthis is greatly appreciated by the recipients and\ngives a great sense of satisfaction and fulfillment.\nEntertainments Officer\nThis is a new post which will for the first time:\nbe elected at aUG M whereas previously there\nhas been an Entertainments Chairman who\nwas elected from the Ents Committee. The\nEnts Officer will chair the Entertainments\nCommittee who will be responsible for\norganising concerts, film shows, discos, and\nany other events as they deem necessary.\nThe Entertainments Officer will sit on\nCouncil and so will take a far more active part\nin the governing of the Union than previously\nand will also be directly accountable to Council\nfor the organisation of entertainments in\nCollege.\nPermanent Working Party\nThere are four vacancies on P WP two of which\nmust be occupied by first year students..\nThe objects of the party shall be:\na) To investigate any topics referred to it by\nUnion Council (the managing body of the\nUnion) or the Executive (President, Deputy\nPresident and Hon Sec of IC Union, plus the\nPresident of C&G Union, President of RCS Union and President of Royal School of Mines\nUnion) and shall report back to the next\nCouncil meeting.\nb) To investigate any other areas that it\nconsiders relevant to IC students and to\nreport, firstly, to a Council meeting and then, if\nnecessary, to aUG M either in the form of a report or as a motion.\nAs can be seen from the objects of the party\nthe post of P WP member can encompass any\narea of Union life. The P WP has to have a working knowledge of all parts of the Union\nand thus be able to tackle any specific problem\nthat may arise.\nP WP members sit on Internal Services\nCommittee which has as its objects the\norganisation and development of the services,\nboth College run and Union run, that are\navailable to IC students. This year this includes\nthe Southside Shop which is now a jointly run\nUnion/ College venture and being a new\nproject needs careful monitoring and adjustment over the forthcoming year.\nAll P WP members also sit on Council and\nare thus involved in the makin q of imo or tant policy decisions that affect all students at IC\nThe time involved is minimal compared to the\nknowledge of the working of the Union gained\nand the impact that can be made therein.\nAP Editor\nThe Alternative Prospectus is a student\npublication the aim of which is \"to provide, for\nthe benefit of the potential IC student, an\naccurate and balanced view of the advantages\nand disadvantages of IC\". The AP has articles\non all the departments within IC, written by\nthe Departmental Representatives, who try to\ngive an unbiased view of the courses as they\nsee them. There are also general articles on\nthe various clubs and societies, facilities\navail a able, welfare, accommodation, overseas\nstudents and life in general at IC.\nThe Editor's job is first to extract these\narticles from the people concerned and then to\nbring them together to form the final product.\nThe AP Editor sits as a permanent observer on\nCouncil and is a member of IC Publications\nBoard which includes the Editor of FELIX,\nEditor ICU Handbook, STOIC Chairman, IC\nRadio Manager, and The Phoenix Editor.\nAcademic Affairs\nThere are two posts vacant for ordinary members of the Academic Affairs Committee\nand the post of Academic Affairs Secretary.\nThe objects of the Committee shall be:\na) The investigation of the purpose and\nstructure of the degree system, together with\nits means of assessment.\nb) The co-ordination of all the Academic\nAffairs subcommittees and staff/student\ncommittees within Imperial College.\nSubjects discussed vary from the perennial\nproblem of unsatisfactory maths lecturing for\nnon-maths specialist students, to the Sir Peter\nS winner ton Dyer Report on Academic Organisation. The post of secretary merely\ninvolves a little more work in the writing of\nminutes and posting of notifications for\nmeetings.\nBelow is the list of successful parking permit\nappeals. Window stickers will be allocated to\nthese applicants to identify their cars and the\nparking space to be used. Stickers are\navailable from the Union Office on production\nof the Vehicle Registration Certificate and a Unioncard.\nI must stress that with joint applications only\none of the cars must be in College at any time\notherwise other people who have been\nallocated a space will be unable to park. If\nmore than one car of a joint application is\nfound parked in College then the permits will\nbe removed and reallocated.\nAny permit not collected before 5:30pm on\nFriday, November 13 will be reallocated.\nAl-Nakeeb, H.J Y T36W Atkinson, N.

    "content": "Is Industry Boring?\nWe, the IC Industrial Society, think not.\nA large proportion of a university' s ex-inmates enter industry\neach year, many with no idea of\na how a business is run.\nThe first student industrial society was set up in 1974, with\nhelp from the national Industrial\nSociety, with the aim of improving\nthis situation. There are now over\nthirty such groups of which we are\nthe most active in the country!!\n(Fanfare, applause, etc.)\nThe ICIS arranges visits to\ndifferent concerns, where we meet\nmanagers and workers; we also\ninvite prominent figures to College\nto outline their organisation and\nanswer any questions from the\naudience.\nSocial events play a part this\nyear. For instance, more cheese\nand wine evenings and a dinner.\nThe Gas Rig-last year's most\nambitious event.\nThe society holds a regular meeting every Friday at 12:30 in Chem Eng\nConcourse (near the Bookshop); anybody is welcome to come along,\npick up a programme of events, join the society (only 50pa year) or just\noffer your thoughts.\nFinally, our next trip is on Wednesday, November 4, to British Steel,\nSheffield. The next speaker is from British Gas, on Friday, November 6\nat 1:00pm in Chem Eng LT1 dealing with Energy Policy up to the year\n2000.\nChairman Chris Wilshaw Chem Eng 4\nVice Chairman H Johnstone Min ResEng2\nVisits Manager Mark Skeater DoC2\nPresentations Paul Harrison Chem Eng 2\nSecretary Alistair Kirk Physics 2\nPublicity Officer Andrew LaytonPhysics 2\nSecretary M Nakamura DoC 3\nLADY FLOWERS and the IC Wives Club invite you to a FREE BEER AND B ANGERS in the Rector's Pad(170 Queens gate). Starts at 5 : 3 0 pm on Wednesday, November4. All Fresher s particularly welcome. Anyone wishing to attend should give their name to Jen in the IC Union Office by 12:00 noon on Monday, November2. YES!!\nAn alternative view of\nIndustrial Society\nOne of the more active and apparently well funded societies in this\nCollege is the student Industrial Society. It presents itself in the form of a glossy, well produced twenty-four page booklet used in other colleges as\nwell as Imperial, and a single page insert produced by the local college\nbranch. The booklet contains numerous photographs, twelve articles of\nabout a page each, and enough full and half-page advertisements to fill\nabout a third of the space. The stated purpose of this expensive looking\npublicity is to try to make students better disposed towards industry.\nOddly enough the insert is much more strident, almost militant, in tone\nthan the glossy booklet.' The industrial base of Britain is\ndisappearing...Industry is important...the driving force behind our\nsociety...Get involved in the dynamic world of industry...\" the leaflet says.\nThere seems to be something like missionary zeal in the determination of\nthe student Industrial Society that we should all be keen on industry.\nWhat exactly motivates people like Christopher Wilshaw. ICIS\nChairman and author of the leaflet, to get involved in the 'industry is\nwonderful' propaganda? One of the articles in the booklet gives us a clue.\nUnder the heading ' What employers look for', Geoffrey Prior, Wandesforde Senior Recruitment Manager for Unilever PLC, writes \"It is\nperhaps not a coincidence that in the last few years we have recruited a number of local committee members of a( student industrial) society.\"\nGot the job fixed up yet, Chris?\nAs far as Mr Prior W andes for de and the other industrialist contributors to the booklet are concerned there isn't any need for a clue.\nIn the same article as before we read \"...we find quite frequently that\nmembership of the Industrial Society can be of great assistance in\nproviding opportunities for developing self-confidence in speaking to an\naudience, of (sic) meeting with a range of people outside the university, of\nmotivating people and running an organisation.\" In other words, 'these\nstudent industrial society johnnie s make good recruits'. \u00bb\nIn another article, some incautious remarks made by Karen Wood,\nleader of the Industrial Society Student Campaign, gave some insight into\nthe real attitudes of industry propagandists. Life outside the university is\nreferred to as the Rat Race (surely not if you're working in industry,*\nKaren?) and she tells us to prepare for the \"gruesome reality\" of earning a living. Sir Adrian Cadbury, Director of Cadbury-Schweppes Ltd, includes '\na passage in his article which seems calculated to make people flinch with\nhorror: \"The field which is developing fastest...is the harnessing of.,\nremarkable productivity and versatility of bugs to produce protein from*\nabundant or waste materials (shit?). Ranks Hovis MacDougall already\nhave a pilot plant producing micro protein of this kind...\" so watch out.\nAs far as the public aims of the Industrial Society are concerned they\nare obviously doomed to failure. The fact that thousands of recruitment\nbooklets are being produced is an admission that most people don't find\nindustry particularly interesting or dynamic. Necessary yes, but so are\npublic lavatories and they aren't very inspiring either. Industry is\nconcerned with the dull task of keeping us supplied with food, clothing,*\nshelter and transport, and making money. A scientist might be involved\nwith the secrets of the universe, a lawyer or doctor with dramatic, even\nlife-or-death issues, but a factory manager has to find a way of making\ncheaper tractor tyres. Cheap tractor tyres are very useful (more useful\nthan lawyers or scientists) but they don't have any moral, emotional or\nintellectual appeal, the sort of appeal which attracts students to industry\nwants to employ. The unfortunate fact is that usefulness is not regarded\nas a great virtue, and few people feel much urge to be useful to humanity.\nThey want some status and some glamour, which they might get in the\nForeign Office but not in the hotel or catering trade. Only a flimsy\npretence of usefulness is enough to make a sinecure respectable and\nsought after\u2014look at the competition for academic posts.\nThe Industrial Society might succeed in getting a few more students to\nconsider work in industry but they cannot make much impact given the;\ngeneral attitude towards industry which is partly due to snobbery and\npartly to a natural feeling that there can be more to a working life than\nmaking washing machines and financial audits.\nN. Wilson .\nFELIX, October 30, 1981 Page 5\n\n"

However all was made clear on\nSaturday when the UCL Captain said that\nthey had arrived at 1:45pm. three quarters of\nan hour later than invited.\nThe Southampton Invitation on Saturday\nwas also very enjoyable with the rain holding\noil'just until the end ol the race, which was\nrun along tracks through some beautiful\nF'orestry Commission Land. A strong performance was again given by\nT. Asteriades and C. Wall. Thanks also to R. Weston. P. Holds worth. A.B rilton. R. Morrison, D. Goodman and A.

John Rigby opened the\nscoring, after good work by Mc Xi cholas. and\nheaded a second following a corner. A dipping shot from Dave Hardy inc leased tin-lead, but London penetrated the IC del en ce to\nscore just before hall-time.\nIn the second half, a cross from the lt-f\"t wing enabled Gladman to score from close\nrange and, after a similar well-worked move.\nMcMahon made no mistake.\nThe charitable nature of Dave Hardy and\nJohn Rigby was evident when both missed\npenalties, obviously to save London the misery\nof a defeat b v double figures, as further goals\nfrom Gladman.

There was only one bad\nfeature of the game, thai was a static back-division. Often, poor, slow handling caused\nthe ball to end up yards behind il s starting\npoint, against IC's favour.

    "content": "rl diki tid Wardens Places Two\nSenior Warden Don Mon ro has been uncharacteristically quiet since last week's editorial. What's up\u2014cat got your tongue, eh?\nAnyway, a further thought has occurred to\nme on this subject. The two Southside Wardens, Dr Paul Jowitt (Fatmouth/Keogh)\nand Dr Henry Hutchinson (Tizard/Selkirk)\nhave recently taken on added responsibility\nwhen their various halls combined.\nHowever, as well as taking on the\nwarden ships I believe (please correct me if I'm wrong!) that the two wardens have inherited\nthe warden's places of their predecessors.\nNow this means that they now each have six\nrather than three places at their disposal.\nAdmitted they have not exactly taken out new\ncontracts\u2014merely modified their previous\nones\u2014 but the spirit of the Student Residence\nCommittee directive against warden's places\nwas quite clear and perhaps the wardens\nshould be asked to hand these extra places\nover.\nThis situation provides one explanation for\nDon Monro's ridiculous desire to have three\nwarden's places in Montpelier Street. Together with his Weeks Hall places this\nwould give him six places too! Keeping up with\nthe Joneses? Or is it the Jowitts?\nMontpelier Street \u2022\nOh really! Does Nick Morton seriously think\nthat anyone will be taken in by his letter on\npage two? However I 'll try to hold back the\nlaughter and thank Nick for his wonderful hard\nwork for the Montpelier Street residents that\nhas resulted in the overwhelming probability of\na rent rebate. Good idea sir!\nIn fact his actions were so dynamic that I mm wu cm General Reisenschein has decided to give his\nsupport to disarmament week by getting rid of all\nhis ground-to-ground missiles: already he's making plans to launch them...\nYou may remember that in this column last\nyear I described the town of Quadratsburg\nwhich is divided by its eighteen roads into\nsixty-four blocks, arranged in a square. One of\nthese contained the military headquarters, and\nin the four blocks orthogonal ly(i. e. not\ndiagonally) adjacent were four ammunitions\ndumps.\nI say were because this Greek cross shape\nwas rather vulnerable, and on the advice of\nFELIX readers General Reisenschein bombed\nout the ten blocks shown in the diagram,\nconfident that he must hit the headquarters or\none of the ammunitions dumps.\nQuadratsburg has now been rebuilt, and the\nheadquarters and three of the dumps are in the\nsame places as before. The fourth dump,\nhowever, has been moved to a new site in a block\nadjacent to its old position, and is now next to\none of the other three dumps.\nAlas, military intelligence (a contradiction in\nterms if ever there was one) has revealed all the\nabove information to Reisenschein, who once\nagain is appealing to FELIX readers to show him\nhow few missiles he needs in order to be\ncertain of hitting his target, and which blocks\nhe should aim for.\nhave christened our glorious leader Action\nMan. That seems appropriate.\nWhilst on that note, are there any\nsuggestions for suitable names for other Union\nOfficers or College personalities \u2014 send suggestions to me by Monday, 1:30pm and I 'll\ngive a list of the most popular and appropriate\nnames (rude or otherwise).\nStaff Meeting\nDespite the extensive credits we still need\nregular contributors (mainly news reporters).\nMore staff means larger issues and hence\nmore room for those extra items like reviews\nand cartoons which have been sadly lacking.\nCome into the FELIX Office (on the right\nunderneath Beit Archway) at 12:30pm today if\nyou are interested in finding out more. Weekly\nstaff meetings are held at this time.\nBusiness Manager\nMarco has outlined the various Union posts\nleft unfilled on page six, but has left FELIX\nBusiness Manager up to me.\nBasically this post involves keeping the\nFELIX account books up-to-date, administering the payment and receipt of money and\npreparing financial estimates for next year. It\ndoesn't involve an enormous amount of time,\nbut you must be able to see the Senior\nTreasurer on Monday lunchtimes and attend\nPublications Board. Papers go up in the Union\nLower Lounge this week. It would be wise to\nsee me if you are interested as I can give you\nfurther details.\nHalloween Party\nTonight is the C CU Halloween Party which\nincludes the sensation Mari Wilson and the\nImaginations\u2014an extremely dance able band\nwith a \"sixties\" sound fronted by Miss Beehive\nherself. Please try and turn up in fancy dress.\nThis is the best way to make the party extra-special, so make the effort (even if it's only a little mask!).\nCredits\nThe following people deserve to have their\npraises sung from the highest towers: Lesley\nHorrocks, Steve Groves (for last week's cover\nphoto), Eddie, Jane, Peter, Dave, Chrissie,\nDebbie, Shams, Mike( x2), Martin, Phil,\nRichard Archer (no relation), Alistair, Steve\nBrown, Danuta, Maz and Ian.\nooo ooo0 o0o Last Week's Puzzle\nNo answers received to last week's puzzle;\njust several letters begging for another week to\nwork on it. So be it, but let me amplify the hint.\nThe word normally is deliberately ambiguous. I mean it in the sense of correctly, properly, in the\nnecessary manner, and not in the sense of\nperpendicular. You may feel that a hint which\nsays 'write it out so that it makes sense' is\nunhelpful to the point of churlishness, and\nperhaps you're right. Nevertheless, the hint\ndoes contain useful information, and every\nword was carefully chosen when 1 wrote\nwhat I now repeat: try rewriting it all normally.\nGood luck everyone!\nSolutions, comments, criticisms to me at the\nFELIX Office, please.

Marching under the ICU and ICC ND banners the group joined the London student\nsection of the C ND protest at Victoria Embankment. After an\nhour, the group began to move, at which time the marchers had been entering Hyde Park for about tw o hours.\nThe C ND estimated a total ol 250,000 people, ranging Irom\nwhite haired nuns to pram confined children crowded into\nHyde Park, where a wide range of specially composed antin ucla r songs and slogans added atmosphere. The crowd were\nentertained by steel bands, theatre groups and a consortium of\nspeakers. Among the speakers were historian E.P. Thompson, Leader of the Opposition Michael Foot, Tony Benn, church representatives and a moving Japanese speaker who witnessed\nthe nuclear explosion at Hiroshima. The London rally coincided with a similar protest ol 300,000\npeople in Rome and was followed by protests of 50,000 in Paris,\n200,000 in Brussels and50.000 in East Germany on Sunday. This is all part of the rapidly growing European opposition to\npresent LS defence policy, NATO strategy and the escalating\narms race in Europe. ICC ND contributed to the organisation of the London rally\nby providing a contingent of ten stewards and a group to help\nwith the making of about 50,000 placards.\n\u2022II-.. \u2022\u201e.\u201e,;\nTony Benn addresses the crowd in Hyde Park after the march\nfrom Victoria (Photo: Steve Brown)\nNUS man at IC\nNUS President Dave Aaron ov itch will be coming to speak\nto the IC Liberal Club next\nWednesday, November4 at\n1:00pm in Huxley213.

Instead I hey intend that 100% of the\nprofits will be donated directly to a charity of their choice.\nThe move was started by\nC&GI' Entertainments Chairman, Simon Shaw, who is organising the carnival and is the primary opponent of the\nRag Mag. He approached the\nC& GU Executive, expressed\nhis desire to have nothing to\ndo with IG Rag and was given\ntheir full support.\nAt the I CRag Committee held last Wednesday evening, C& GU President Andy Rush ton announced their intentions. The suggestion that somebody else could organise the event was made and disquiet expressed that an individual could seemingly\naffect the passage of money in\nthis way.

Fortunately,\nthe psychology worked in favour of IC. The conditions were certainly the best one could\nhave hoped for and the final result was 9-6.\nAlthough IC played a fast game, often\nkeeping the opposition under pressure, the\ngame displayed too many blatant inadequacies. The backs had an unbelievable\ninability to finish-off from many good breaks\nand often caught out in defence due to some\npoor positional thinking. This needs working\non bel bre the cup game. Line philosophy is\nessential but quite simple, if only IC's backs\nwould believe it.\nIC's try was scored by Aston, alter a controlled push over, the other five points\ncoming from the conversion of the try and a simple penalty.\nSeconds\nThis was another good win lor the Second\nXV, who are beginning to look and play\nmore like a proper side now.\nThe match started oil on a low note, with\nthe opposition intent at beating the team in\nevery aspect except rugby, and there were a number of un savoury moments. Turning this\nto our advantage, wc took the game from them,\nand with the forwards winning most of the\nball, the backs had plenty of chances to run\nat them. This showed, with the half-time\nIn the second half, we continued to\npressurize them, and it was inevitable that\nthe team would score more, against what was\nnow a disheartened side.\nIt was thus a goodall round team performance, with tries from J. Davies (3), A. Ralph(1), M. Winsor (1), N. Brummell(2). G. Pike (2), R. Flynn(2), and J. Syrrtes\nmanaged to kick four conversions.\nTeam: J. Symes, R. Flynn, .V. Brummell, J. Weir, (\u2022'.

That\nfirst half saw Phil Niccol ls' remarkable shooting ability displayed to the full. His\ntwenty-live yard el fort actually hitting the\ncorner Hag and an el fort from the edge of the\nbox that he ended up nearly trapping.\nThe second half saw Dave Dean finally\nfinding the net with two goals. Niccolls was\nonce more in action as he \" rose like a pilchard\" at the far post for a cross but was a good two feet below the ball and then hit a screaming volley that travelled all of two\nyards before being blocked. Ward did an\naction replay of Mul hall last year, neatly\nplacing the ball over the bar. Niccolls finally\nreaped the fruits of his random shooting\nscoring oil the inside of the keeper' leap. At the other end, Reeve was keeping Williams busy with one of his 'special' back passes.\nFinally, Andy Page capped a much improved\nsecond half performance with a goal from as uber b glanced header to give us a 'close' 6-0\nwin!\nTeam: A. Williams, M. Curran, S. Dunhill, S. Ward, K. Reeve, J. Lay, P. Xiccolls, A. Pane, D. Dean, M. Carr, G. Richard.\nThirds\nAfter being defeated 4-0 by the hands of UC Seconds on Wednesday, IC Thirds stepped\nout of the clouds of gloom and laced Kings College Seconds away. The early pace was\nvery last with shooting chances to either side\nin the fu st half. IC played with the wind in\nthe second half and came very close with\nAndy Hartland just failing to convert several\nchances. Xlick Flanagan, promoted from the\nSeconds combined well up front and guest\nappearances from Phil Lakin and John Burns\nwere very much appreciated.

Bails attacked strongly, but the\nIC defence, with Steve V eats and Dave Kindred outstanding, did well to prevent an\nimmediate equalise r. The fourths found more space in the\nsecond hall and Mc Nicholas and Rigby persistently unsettled the Baits defence while,\nat the other end, keeper Andy Slater dealt\ncapably when under pressure.\nAn unlucky deflection from your correspondent's jaw enabled a Barts striker tc\nequalise, but the determined character of the\nfourths emerged as the IC side battled on.\nThe midi ie ld men grew in confidence and\nbegan to take control, but there was one tense\nmoment when Baits had a goal disallowed for\noffside.\nHowever, despite creating several good\nchances the Fourths could not overcome the\nstubborn Barts resistance and ultimately had\nto be content with a draw.\nTeam: Slater, Maddy, Heath, Veals, Kindred,\n(Madman, McMahon, Dolan, McPhnil, Rigby,\nMcNicholas.\nSevenths\nA tH arlington IC beat St Thomas' Hospital Seconds 2-1 but should have won by more.\nAfter a scoreless first half Peter Rodgers\ngave IC the lead following a coin er although\nthe goalkeeper was at fault.\nMark Lenczner then made one of many\nruns deep into St Thomas' penalty area\nbefore being brought down Julian Norley\nscored from the penalty.\nAfter this Lenczner, Norley and Fishwick\nall went close to scoring before St Thomas'\nbroke away to score their only goal.\nTeam: R.

The opposition having provided a substitute, IC played the\nfirst half under a considerable amount of\npressure and Birkbeck were duly rewarded\nwith a one goal advantage at half-time. After\nthe restart, we came increasingly into the\ngame, and there were Hashes of the team's true potential. Our spirits were lifted further\nby a coolly taken equalise r shortly before the\nend of the game. This was the cue for some\nspirited attacking from the home side, who\nwere awarded a controversial short corner\nwhich they converted well.\nThe scorer was Bansal.\nTeam: Bullet, Riley, Coatesworlh, Parker,\nFranklin, Clarke, Bansal, Rao, Bell, Avers, Cray.\nThirds\nDespite the help of several Second XI players, the Third XI still managed to put up\na good performance against Uxbridge. With the score at 1-1 just before hall-time, Captain Andy Purdy had the good sense to dislocate\nhis shoulder before Pete Hughes could get\nanywhere near him! Hughes, it must be said,\nsporting ly agreed to play for the opposition\nbut then rather un sporting ly proceeded to\nscore twice for them!

    "content": "Monro gives in\nProbable rebate for Montpelier St\nOn Tuesday, October27, the acting Warden of Montpelier Street Hall of Residence, Dr Don Mon ro, held a meeting with the Hall committees and the majority of residents. Although the\nmeeting was primarily organised, so that the warden could discuss the important matter of a rent rebate, with the Hall Committee it seems that the weight attached to this issue by the\nresidents drew them to the gathering of large numbers. A week before this meeting a petition summa rising the feeling\nof the majority of the residents had been handed in to the sub-warden. The petition read:\n\"lie Ihe undersigned wish lo express our dissatisfaction with\nl/ ie prevailing conditions in 14 Montpelier .Street. U'e wish to\npoint out that many of the facilities as promise e/ in the\naccommodation literature are either inadequate or absent. In view\nof this state of affairs ice feel that the present rent of \u00a323pw is\nunreasonable and that some form of compensation should be\nforthcoming.\"\nThis document was signed by a considerable number ol the\nresidents. As well as this petition a letter was also delivered which had been draught ed by the Hall Committee, listing what were considered as the main def ici en ces and, in the light ol\nthese, a rent ol \u00a318.50 (the rent for a single room in Beit Hall) was suggested.\nAfter DrM on ro had run through the points raised by the\nresidents in the letters, a general discussion took place in which all present took part.\nAlthough DrM on ro seemed to agree with many of the points\nit Ix'came clear through the meeting that a rent rebate was\nhighly unlikely this term,an tl that it might be possible for\nresidents to attain this rebate next term. It was also made quite\nclear that unless the support of IC Union was gained the\nresidents would not realistically have a chance of obtaining their rebate.\nA meeting took place at Montpelier just after lunch on Thursday with Nick Morton. From the meeting it seems that\nthe Hall Committee have managed to gain his support.\nLaithwaite\nback on top\n\"Bomb\" goes\noff well\nThe ICU and ICCND banners\nAs part of their events for\nUnited Nations Disarmament Week, ICC ND screened Jonathan Dimbleby' s The\nBomb twice on Tuesday ol this\nweek.\nThe documentary was originally shown on Yorkshire Television last year and was\nan investigation into the current nuclear de Ien ce policy of the United States\nand Britain. It was suggested that modern warning systems themselves and a massive buildup of nuclear arms could eventually lead to a disastrous nuclear war. Three times in1980 American computer systems indicated at Saturday's march.\nan attack and bombers were\nat the end ol the runway before being recalled. A brief interview with Francis Py m( then British Defence Secretary) was included. He defended Britain' s policy of accepting Cruise missiles and pointed out that\nmillions had died in WorldWar2 fighting for a democracy which he wanted to maintain.7 he Bomb showed the horror ol nuclear holocaust quite graphically, particularly by\nan interview with two of the\nsurvivors of Hiroshima. However, it was not comprehensive in its treatment and was not completely impartial in its presentation.\nProfessor Eric Lai thwaite has recovered from his recent bout of\nflu, and will be lecturing to the Astronomical Society on Tuesday, November3, at 0 : 3 0 pm in Physics Lecture Theatre1. his topic will be ' Gravity, Mass and Inertia'. Do you eat here often?\nOver seven hundred questionnaires on the College refectories were handed out this\nweek. The questionnaire, designed by the ICU Executive, is aimed at providing information which will in di cate improvements needed to\nthe refectory service.\nMembers of ICU Council handed out the questionnaires\nin refectories starting on last\nMonday. The results are not\nyet known and the President\nis currently attempting the\nmassive task of compiling the information himself. The results will be taken to the\nCollege authorities and a summary will app car in FELIX. Questions ranged from the\nabsurd( Do you eat here often?) to the obvious( Is there\nsomething wrong with the food itself.'). A section on the\nuse of the Southside Shop may prove useful.\nThe major problem with the questionnaire was that it\ntook along time to till in and was only distributed to refectory users, not the masses\nwho avoid them completely.

The second and\nmore important point is: IC Bookshop is\nowned by the College unions and its profits are\nreturned annually to the unions to assist the\nfinancing of students' activities.

Wells and the\nAetherius Society\nThe society was founded in 1955 by George King, then a Fulham taxi\ndriver. It is a quasi-religious society with the aim of spreading the\nteachings of godlike interplanetary beings for 'the good of all mankind'.\nThis is the society's history of how the interplanetary rapport developed.\n\"One Saturday morning in 1954 Dr George King was addressed by a mysterious voice, which gave him the following instruction 'Prepare\nyourself! You are to become the voice of interplanetary parliament!'\nThe voice made this pronouncement in perfect English and held a peculiar musical quality, not possessed by an ordinary earth voice.\nDr King did not fully understand the command at the time but believed\nit to be of vital significance. Eight years later Dr King who was sitting\nalone in his West End flat was visited by a great master of yoga from\nIndia, who gave Dr King instructions in advanced yoga, which enabled\nhim to gain telepathic rapport with a Being from the planet Venus. The\nbeing was given the pseudonym Aetherius.\nAs time went on the messages from space intelligence s increased in\nlength, regularity and urgency giving Dr King messages of wisdom and\nadvice to mankind.\nOn July 27, 1958 Dr King gained contact from the Master Jesus, also\nfrom Venus. The great Cosmic Master of love gave the twelve blessings,\nand the first chapter of his aquaria n age bible, teachings which were\npublished by the society and adopted as a doctrine.\"\nThe main function of the society is to propagate vital transmissions\nfrom the Master Aetherius, the Master Jesus, Mars Sector 6 (also a cosmic master) and other highly evolved cosmic intelligence s.' The society organises prayer-circles during a 'spiritual push' or\n'Magnetization Period'. (The Magnetization Period is when a giant interplanetary spacecraft called Satellite No 3 is brought into orbit around\nEarth by the Cosmic masters). The prayer circles are held around holy\nmountains in Europe, America, Africa and Australasia, where 'pilgrims\nradiate dynamical power to help all mankind'.\nCurrently the Aetherius Society is involved in two main operations\nOperation Sunbeam is a means of using prayer power to repay some of\nman's collective debt to earth\u2014the goddess Terra. Operation Prayer\nPower is a a means of storing prayer in a special battery, which is\ndischarged during major disasters, such as earthquakes and floods, to\nhelp the stricken areas.\nSir Richard Lawrence from the Aetherius Society will be addressing the\nH.G. Wells Society on Monday in Elec Eng 408 at 7:30pm. Page 8 FELIX, October 30, 1981\n\n"
