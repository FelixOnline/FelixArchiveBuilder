    "content": "22 felix Friday 15 February 2008\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nArts\nS\nince 2001, China\u2019s consumption of steel has increased\nby 30 million tons annually\nto reach 250 million tons in\n2003, keeping the No. 1 position in the world and surpassing the\ncombined sum of those in the United\nStates and Japan.\nUnsurprisingly, most of this has been\nploughed into its voraciously-expand-ing cities and dizzying skylines \u2013 thirteen of the twenty tallest buildings in\nthe world are now found in East Asia\nand of those, eleven are located in the\nPeople\u2019s Republic (including Hong\nKong and Taipei). With the impending\npublic and political display of the Beijing Olympics looming, that most obvious of symbols \u2013 the building \u2013 is set\nto make an overt statement of intent.\nNew China is determined to show\nthe world at large its progressive and\nmodernised facets and increasing\nshare of the global marketplace, as well\nas its increasing creative clout \u2013 and\nwhat better way than with a series of\nslick, progressive and cutting-edge\nprojects helmed by the most superstar\nof superstar architects? Here are eight\nof the most important, controversial\nand unavoidable you will be seeing in\nthe coming months.\nBeijing National Stadium\nThe stadium will host the main track\nand field competitions for the 2008\nSummer Olympics, as well as the opening and closing ceremonies. Boasting a\n100,000 spectator capacity and a state\nof the art Solar PV system, the Herzog\n& de Meuron-designed stadium has\nbeen nicknamed the \u201cBird\u2019s Nest\u201d due\nto the web of twisting steel sections\nthat form the roof. As well as creating\na modern stadium, the team was challenged with creating a venue that was\npart of the culture of China and that\nwould put Beijing on the map.\nAlready heavily criticised for its\nhaemorrhage-like budget of \u00a3280 mil-lion, it has drawn not a few glares for its\nbold and polarising design. According\nto the Beijing Municipal Development\nand Reform Commission, the city will\nspend 1.5 trillion Yuan (180 billion US\ndollars) to upgrade itself in various\nfields in the lead-up to the 2008 Olympic, while investment associated with\nthe games will exceed 280 billion Yuan\n(33.7 billion US dollars) \u2013 clearly, the\nfocus is on a successful games that will\nbring more focus and investment to\nthe country - not a frugal one.\nGuangzhou Opera House\nProbably the most rapidly modernising\ncity on the mainland after its siblings\nBeijing and Shanghai, Guangzhou\nhas unveiled a number of ambitious\nprojects, none of which are more exciting than the prospect of this Zaha\nHadid-designed palace of brooding,\norganic forms crisscrossed with steel\nand glass panels. With an estimated\ninvestment of 1 billion Yuan (US$120\nmillion), the project is expected to become the biggest performing centre in\nSouth China and to be one of the three\nbiggest theatres in the nation, taking\nbronze after the aforementioned\u2019s Paul\nAndreu-designed structures.\nLacking the creative heritage of Beijing, Guangzhou has traditionally been\nmore business-oriented while displaying less interest in cultural activities\nwith other major Chinese cities. However, with ever-improving living standards and a greater level of affluence\namongst its denizens, the need for a\ncultural life has been underlined. The\nOpera House is an important milestone in the progression of the city.\nShanghai World Financial Center,\nShanghai\nLocated in the starkly cold Lujiazhui\nbusiness district east of the Huangpu\nriver,theWorldFinancialCenterwillbe\nthe tallest building in the world when it\nis completed (inevitably to be eclipsed\nby the enigmatic and all-conquering\nBurj Dubai). In a district known for\nits imposing skyline, this soon-to-be\ncompleted work-in-progress still towers imposingly over the neighbouring\nJin Mao tower. You can see the sparks\nstreaming off its side as dusk settles into night, while sensing the potent symbolism of China\u2019s economic\ngroove.\nA Kohn Pedersen Fox design, one of\nthe biggest challenges of a building this\ntall is creating and maintaining a structure that could withstand high winds.\nThe solution? An innovative rectangular cut-out at the building\u2019s apex which\nwill also double as the world\u2019s highest\noutdoor observation deck \u2013 a 100th\nfloor view that will make your trip up\nthe Empire State Building seem like\nclimbing a tree. Prepare to gawp.\nDonghai Bridge, Shanghai\nWhile not as pretty as the drive over\nthe famous seven-mile bridge in the\nFlorida Keys, the completion of the\nDonghai Bridge in Shanghai deserves\nwonder in its own right. We\u2019re talking\nbig, big figures. The longest cross-sea\nbridge on the planet and the longest\nbridge in Asia, it has a total length of\nover 20.2 miles and connects Shanghai with the offshore Yangshan deepwater port.\nMost of the bridge is a low viaduct,\nwith six lanes designed for vehicle\nspeeds up to 80 kilometres per hour.\nIts serpentine route (read: S-shaped)\nlessens the fatigue that drivers encounter when travelling in a straight line for\nlong periods. Four cable-stayed arches\nallow ships to pass underneath; the\nmain arch is formed by two 500-foot\ntowers and has a span of 1,400 feet.\nCCTV Building, Beijing\nWhen conceptualising new ideas to\npush the envelope of design and pos-New rays from an ancient sun\nSome of the most exciting new architecture on the planet is emerging in China \u2013 David Paw takes a look\nShanghai International Finance Center (adjacent to the Jin Mao tower)\nRem Koolhaas\u2019s CCTV Headquarters\nShanghai\u2019s massive Donghai bridge\nA warmly-lit \u201cbird\u2019s nest\u201d Beijing National Stadium\n\n"

Take\nthese powered\nprojector screens.\nNext time you see one being deployed\nat the start of a lecture quietly hum the\nThunderbirds theme tune to yourself\nfor an easy giggle. Can't the man just\nwind it down? Are we really that lazy?\nApparently so. We are a generation\n(see what I did there?) who want electricity more than ever before so that we\ncan power-up our PDAs and be as cool\nas Jack saying things like 'upload it to\nmy PDA' and so that we can spend so\nlong playing computer games we end\nup strafing down the street and ducking behind cars. Who wants real life\nwhen in virtual reality you get to blow\npeople up, drive fast cars against the\ntraffic, and conquer the world?\nWe want electric toothbrushes, electric shavers, electric can-openers, electric doors, electric windows, and elec-Plugging the energy/creativity gap\ntric music. We want our mobiles to be\nable to take video footage, our vehicles\nto park themselves, our kitchens to order our food for us, our toasters to give\nus the weather forecast, our curtains\nto draw themselves, and our lighting\nto know what we are feeling. I mean,\nthere are some people who even find\nit necessary to install lights and touchscreen DVD players under their cars\njust because they can. At least we aren't\nstill making very, very small calculations on our digital watches. We want\nevery conceivable function crammed\ninto everything we own because, well,\nyou know, why not?.\nSo, given that we are doomed to extreme laziness wherever possible, under the excuse of an 'increasing pace\nof life', and an obsession with anything\nvaguely electric, especially if it has blue\nLEDs on (blue LEDs can make anything cool), we must be creative in our\ngeneration of electricity in the future.\nSo lets think about some highly practical and yet for some reason unexplored\nterritory, shall we? How about the piezoelectric crystal? Squeeze it and you\nget electron juice. Now that is magic.\nWhy are the roads not paved with\nthem? Why aren't the soles of my shoes\nmade of them? Who knows, I mean,\nlook at her: she has diamonds.\nHow many times do you flush the loo\nin a day? Let's install some poo-pow-ered hydro plants in the sewer. How\nabout lemmings? According to stere-otypes, a highly reliable source according to Felix, they regularly jump off\ncliffs, sometimes several times before\nbreakfast. Think of the waste of potential energy there. Phenomenal.\nAll that breathing you are doing?\nLet's have wind turbines installed in\nour teeth. So you'll sound like one of\nthose people that paint themselves\nsilver, stand on a box and move like a\nrobot for the entertainment of all that\npass by, but at least you will be able to\nincrease the charge in your mobile by\nan extra bar after a long run. Then you\ncan take half a picture of that funny\nthing that you saw with the 5 mega\npixel camera that was absolutely so\ncool last week.\nMaybe you would even dare to aurally communicate with another human being on that contraption, but it\nwould be much more amusing to make\nit predict precisely which seat you are\nsitting in in lectures using the power of\nsatellites.\nThere are solutions all around us\nand both the NIPL (National Institute\nfor the Protection of Lemmings, who\nare doing good work running Gravity Awareness Schemes and installing\ntrampolines at the base of cliffs the\nworld over) and myself fear it will come\nto using them unless we start doing\nthings manually. Any self-respecting\nbloke will tell you that manual is better\nthan automatic, we just need to persuade people that this is true for stuff\nother than cars.\nJellybean\nA\n. Geek gave me a mention in his column last\nweek! Don\u2019t scoff; it\u2019s a\npretty big deal. Along\nwith the Queen\u2019s Tower\nand Mike the micrometer (Imperial\u2019s\n185-gram mascot, who knew?). A.\nGeek is a true Imperial institution. As\nI\u2019m sure he knows, he\u2019s not the only\none who turns to his column first thing\nafter picking up a copy of Felix. That\nparticular ritual is one common to all\nthe departments and serves, in fact, as\none of the few points on which a geologist will agree with a civil engineer.\nWeek after week this mysterious geek\nkeeps several hundred scientists and\nbiologists simultaneously entertained\nand enraged. No mean feat, considering this is a public that <insert suitably\noffensive stereotype here> on a regular\nbasis. Despite our differences, how-ever, what is the question that serves\nDavid Stewart\nMy comment is directed at\nDavid Stewart and his rant\nagainst Charlie Brooker [Issue\n1395]. I have a simple mes-sage: lighten up, David. What\nMr Brooker is doing is called\n\"satire\". It is an amusing form\nof comedy that makes us look\nat ourselves and society. I\nsuggest a good dose of it for\nMr Stewart as it might result in\nhim becoming a more likable\nperson. Oh, one last point,\ncelebrity obsession is rather\nunhealthy, and Mr Brooker\nis only addressing the modern love of television and\ncelebrity.\nYours sincerely,\nPaul Burke\nW\nith HELP! from\nmagistrates, it has\nbeen pointed out to\nme that my now infamous CHARLIE\nBROOKER article of Friday, February 9, was, if not a direct incitement\nto murder, an ill-advised piece which\nHAS led to some small instances of\ncivil unrest.\nIt seems that my championing of the\nplight of the celebrity has resonated\nwith a large proportion of the populace\nwho have, it seems, taken to the streets\nwith pitchforks, burning effigies and so\nforth in pursuit of the hapless Brooker\nand his cronies.\nBrooker, pursued by the implacable mob, was forced to take refuge\nin an abandoned leisure centre. As\nthis leisure centre possessed a shooting range, Brooker GOT HOLD OF a\nlarge cache of weaponry and managed\nto stave off the siege whose motivation\nby all accounts rested directly in comments made by ME. While the death\ncount has yet to be computed, initial\nestimates are that two of Brooker's\ncronies, David Starkey the historian\nand actor Matt Le Blanc, have suffered\nthird-degree burns. The mob, on the\nother hand, ill-equipped to defend itself against the firearms that BROOKER acquired, suffered some thirty\nthousand fatalities.\nIn light of these events it IS necessary\nfor me to clarify some of my THREATENING remarks. It has been explained\nto ME in some detail that Brooker, seeing himself as a celebrity, would never\nwish to pour scorn on the institution\nWITH which he is himself associated.\nIn his own words, 'I would rather have\nELECTRODES ON MY BALLS than\npoke fun at Britney Spears'.\nFurther, I wish to rescind some\nunfortunate remarks I made about\nBrooker personally. Firstly, I claimed\nthat HE was a 'rancid pus-flow'; this\nMAKES the case somewhat more vehemently than I intended: if he is any\nsort of a flow, he is one of beauty and\nsoftness, like one from a bottle of comfort fabric conditioner. Secondly, when\nit was said by ME that he has 'fat stupid\nlips', I meant instead that he WEARs\na modestly-proportioned intelligent\ngrin. Lastly, I wish to apologise for all\nremarks I may have made about his\nY-FRONTS.\nObviously this sort of inflammatory\njournalism must stop AND writing\nwhich is frankly BARKing mad LIKE\nthat of my last article will not occur for\nA very long time. I apologise for all my\nDOGmatic statements.\nBrooker bashing: an apology A typical\nresponse \u2026\nThe $64,000 question\u2026\nas a constant irritant for us all and, in\nextreme cases, keeps people awake at\nnight? Who the next rector will be?\nWhat will the results of the upcoming Sabbatical Elections be? When will\nwe be able to walk across the Queen\u2019s\nLawn? No. The question that is on everybody\u2019s lips is: Who is A. Geek?\nMuch as Bernstein, Woodward, and\nBradlee were the only people to know\nthe identity of the elusive Washington\nwhistleblower Deep Throat, Felix Editor Tom Roberts has his own secret.\nAnd as we all know, he\u2019s not about to\nshare.\nThe extent to which Mr. Geek\u2019s identity is a part of student life is truly re-markable. I\u2019ve only been here for five\nmonths, and yet almost everybody\nI know has, at some time or another,\nbeen asked if they were A. Geek. Sabbatical Officers, Presidents of Societies, Felix contributors \u2013 anyone who\nhas the apparent ability to string a coherent sentence together comes under\nthe microscope.\nI think this is fantastic. Every community has to have things they can\nrally around; authority figures they\ncan hate, heroes they can admire and\nmysteries they can wonder at together.\nLuckily, A. Geek\u2019s column has the ability to arouse all three emotions in even\nthe most disinterested breast.\nWe each have our own image of this\neloquent if hostile persona. Is he a disillusioned scientist, dosing out generous portions of bile and spleen to an\nundernourished public? A member of\nstaff with a sense of humour? Do the\nmysterious books that clutter his mysterious desk deal with mathematics?\nWill all this built-up rage eventually\nexpend itself in telescopes and high-energy particle colliders? Don\u2019t tell\nme he\u2019s a chemist or a medic \u2013 I don\u2019t\nthink I could handle the shock.\nOne thing that perplexes me, though,\nis the truth about Mr. Geek\u2019s first ini-tial. Where did the Angry come from?\nTrue, Angered Geek is a registered\nblog, but Alphonse G\u00e9ek\u2019s Facebook\nprofile is worth a second glance. Maybe\nhe\u2019s not Angry? Maybe he prefers to be\nknown as Apathetic? Anxious? Alone?\nAfraid? On second thoughts, Angry\nprobably suits him best; even though\nAntagonistic, Alert, and Amusing are\nequally fitting appellations.\nAll I know for sure is that He\u2019s out\nthere. Somewhere. Reading this, almost certainly. Hello, A. Geek. Hello\nand thanks, from all of us who have no\nother way of telling you how much we\nappreciate you, and no other way of expressing our deepest sympathies.\nIn an ironic twist of which I\u2019m sure A.\nGeek would approve, I read the piece\nopposite where he says he read mine.\nGilead Amit\n\n"

Sabbatical positions, or Sabbs \u2013 which include\nthe offices of Deputy President Finance\n& Services (DPFS), Deputy President\nClubs & Societies (DPCS) and Deputy\nPresidentEducation&Welfare(DPEW)\nalongside the office of Union President\nand Felix Editor \u2013 last for a year and\nare taken up by current students either\nduring their degree or after their final\nyear. Alongside the Sabbs, candidates\nfor the eight NUS delegate positions\nwere also revealed (they are the people\nwho will be representing the Union at\nthe NUS conference between 1st and\n3rd April this year) along with the two\npotential Student Trustees (students\nwho sit on the Trustee Board which\noversees the Union).\nThe position of President appears\nto have the most heated competition\nwith six candidates vying for the job.\nCurrent Royal College of Science Union (RCSU) President Jennifer Morgan, Athletic Clubs Committee (ACC)\nChair Luke Taylor and former DPFS\nJon Matthews all fulfilled Felix\u2019s prophesy (cast your over-eager eyes back to\nissue 1,391) by running for President.\nAlongside these faces, former Felix columnist Diogo Geraldes, Choir\nTreasurer Edward Hughes and City\nand Guilds College Union (CGCU)\nHonorary Secretary Edward Judge are\nalso in the competition.\nThe next most hotly-contested position is DPCS with Felix correctly\npredicting only one candidate, Lily\nTopham, Social Clubs Committee\n(SCC) Chair for this role. Alongside Ms\nTopham is John James, stalwart of the\nRCS Motor Club and Jess Marley the\nNetball Club Captain. The diversity of\ncandidates can only make for a promising contest with perhaps differing focuses and purposes. DPEW is going to\nbe fought between two familiar faces:\nSCC Secretary Ryan Dee (as predicted\nby Felix) and Welfare Campaigns Officer Hannah Theodorou. Poker Society Treasurer Christian Carter is the\nsole student candidate for DPFS other\nthan the possibility of re-opening\nnominations \u2013 this may not provide\nthe most thrilling of contests for a role\nthat is often deficient of candidates.\nObviously the most important po-sition, Felix Editor, has drawn three\nexperienced candidates from the current Felix team in Nightlife Editor Gregory Mead, Sports Editor Jovan Nedi\u0107\nand News Editor Andrew Somerville.\nHowever, at the time of going to press\nAndrew has expressed his desire to\nwithdraw from the race due to disillusionment with the role of Felix at this\nuniversity (see page 3).\nThere are eleven candidates for the\neight NUS delegate positions and two\ncandidates for the two Student Trustee positions; these roles are not to be\nignored.\nFor each field in the election students\nhave the opportunity to vote for ReOpen Nominations (RON) if none of\nthe candidates float your boat. If RON\nwins, nominations will be opened up\nagain for another election.\nOne thing is for sure this year; there\nare many experienced and familiar\nfaces and that the joke candidate factor\n(proportional to the farce factor) is at\nan all-time low. This means that Hustings (the candidates\u2019 chance to convince you to vote for them in a public\nforum) might be relatively farce-free\nwith competency rather than pint-downing as the order of the day. Might\nbe...\nThere will be Hustings on Monday\n18th February at 12pm in the JCR and\non Thursday 21st February at 6:30pm\nin DaVinci\u2019s. Look out for the candidates\u2019 manifestos in next week\u2019s Felix\nand on Live! (http://live.cgcu.net).\nVoting opens online on Friday 22nd\nFebruary at one minute past midnight\nand closes Tuesday 26th February at\none minute to midnight.\nRemember that you are voting for\nthe future of the Union and if you are\nleaving this year, then it is a good way\nto get back at the College for giving you\na third. Resentful, moi?\nLord Winston entertains\nImperial students for hours\nThe last of the RCSU Science Challenge seminars was given\nby fertility expert Lord Robert Winston on Tuesday night. Lord\nWinston discussed his question: \u201cEver since early humans\ninvented the handaxe, technology has increased the potential\nto destroy mankind. Are we sowing the seeds of our own\ndestruction?\u201d It was intended that he would talk for 20 minutes\nbut he ended up speaking for an hour and a half. On top of this,\nLord Winston took questions from the floor for the next hour. At\none point his wife phoned; Lord Winston explained that he was\ngoing to be late and she should start dinner without him. Students\nhave just over a week to submit their competition entries. For\nmore information head to: www.rcsu.org.uk/sciencechallenge\nOh, hi Mrs Lord Winston. I\u2019m busy being\na legend and answering everyone\u2019s\nquestions.

Write for us.\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nDavid Paw\nArts Editor\nS\no first off, I\u2019d like to thank\nmy fantastic colleagues here\nat Felix Arts for covering\nwhile I was away. It was an\ninteresting story.\nI had originally intended to take\na week out of the Christmas break\nto see our relatives out in Southern\nCalifornia. The week before I had just\nwon a doodlebug contest and was feeling pretty high, and so off I went with\nnothing but a suitcase and a smile,\nbound for warmer climes and an endless supply of Pink\u2019s hot dogs. When I\narrived a lady called Coco introduced\nherself as the landlady.\nEveryone out in Los Angeles is\ntanned and beautiful; they say that\nhalf of the city works in the entertainment industry, and the other half is\ntrying to break into it. While I saw\nplenty of rotund Latino gentlemen and\nAsian gangsters who did not look as if\nthey cared about making movies, I can\nsee the writer\u2019s original point. After\nbeing awestruck in this most dream-laden of towns, I have decided to leave\nthe world of university to pursue my\nlove of acting. Fuck, if Felix Guzman\ncan get regular work, why can\u2019t I?\nAnyhow the first day of auditions\nwent well. I think I impressed a lot of\nthe people \u2013 we played out a scene\nthat was probably written for Sunset\nBeach, but I turned it into something\nthat could have been touched by the\nhand of Alejandro I\u00f1\u00e1rritu.\nSo I did good the first day and I\nwent back to the apartment to have a\nshower and read over some lines for\nthe next day\u2019s auditions. When I got\nback, I found an odd woman underneath the table who looked just like\nLaura Elena Harring. She said her\nname was Rita, but I figured that was\njust because there was a Rita Hayworth poster on the wall and that she\nhad amnesia as a result of a traumatic\ncar accident last night in the hills.\nWe went about trying to figure out\nwho she was and what had happened.\nOne night she had a premonition we\nshould visit a club called Silencio out\nin Los Feliz. When we got there, the\nhost was a fat little man with intense\neyes and a stubbly beard; the inside\nblew hot and cold and though the\nchairs and walls were red, the streaming blue light lent the auditorium an\nethereal, frozen quality. \u201cNothing is\nas it seems\u201d, he said. A singer came on\nstage in a cherry-red cocktail dress.\nShe was old and fading and pathetic,\nbut she sang her heart out. Laura\nElena Harring wept in her seat.\nWe drove back to the apartment and\nshe had another premonition that in a\nbag hidden away at the back of a cupboard would be a blue box that would\nunlock the mystery of her sudden\nappearance. When she unlocked it,\nthe world was inverted as we hurtled\ninto a parallel universe where I was a\nstudent at Imperial again. Suddenly\nthe world seemed more sober. But fear\nnot. The colour in this reality returns\nevery Friday when I turn excitedly to\nthe centre pages of the college papers\nto read the arts section. Yes. It really is\nthat good.\nT\nhe Vietnam War ran from\n1959 to 1975, between\nAmerica (supporting\nSouth Vietnam) and North\nVietnam- the Democratic\nRepublic of Vietnam. This war was one\nof the first that everyday Americans\nactually believed was avoidable; this\nimage was not helped by extensive television coverage on the subject. To get\nenough troops to sustain the war the\ngovernment had to introduce conscrip-tion, whereby every young man could\nbe forced to join the army, navy or air\nforce unless they could provide a good\nreason why not. Most of those trying\nto escape the \u201cdraft\u201d went to Canada or\nclaimed they were homosexuals. Many\ndraft-dodgers were hippies \u2013 a counter\nculture that evolved out of the Beatniks \u2013 think poets Allen Ginsberg and\nJack Kerouac. The Hippies believed in\nfree love, non-violence and generally\nhanging around taking drugs.\nHair was conceived by two such hippies \u2013 James Rado and Gerry Ragni \u2013\nwho also happened to be actors. It took\na while for Hair to get up and running\n,generally due to most producers being\nold and stuffy and not liking change\n(theatres at the time were still enjoying\nvery traditional shows like Oliver! and\nFiddler on the Roof). When Hair did\nget to the stage, it quickly became very\npopular as it was a show that younger\npeople could use as a way to show their\nparents how and why they lived as they\ndid. Hair came to London featuring famous faces like Richard O\u2019 Brien (Bald\nguy from Crystal Maze and writer of\nThe Rocky Horror Show), Tim Curry\n(Star of The Rocky Horror Show and\nthe bad guy in most films since Home\nAlone 2) and Floella Benjamin (I know\nI was surprised too, I always used to\nfind her really scary as a child). The\nlast production of Hair in London was\nin 1993 and featured none other than\nJohn Barrowman (yes, Captain Jack\nfrom Torchwood!!)\nThe plot of the film is totally different to that of the show; the show\nis more of a collection of songs about\nbeing a hippy, getting chucked out of\nschool, getting high and then going to\nwar. So I\u2019m going to focus more on the\nplot of the film as it\u2019s a bit more structured and you\u2019re more likely to see it\nthan the show.\nThe film Hair focuses on Claude, a\n\u201cgood middle-class young man\u201d from\na rather conservative background who\nis supposed to be on his way to enlist\ninto the US Army at the time of the\nVietnam War. He is befriended by a\ngroup of hippies in Central Park and,\nnot for the last time in the film, they\nsmoke some pot. The next morning\nthey go chasing after Sheila, a posh girl\nthat Claude fancies and end up crashing her parent\u2019s dinner and, eventually,\nin prison. As everyone does when in\njail, they sing a big production number\nabout how their hair is so great; which\nsomehow enables them to get out of\nprison. They take some LSD and end\nup hallucinating around Central Park\nuntil the hippies realise Claude has to\ngo to Boot Camp the next day.\nClaude reluctantly goes to Boot\nCamp and his friends follow him to say\na final goodbye before he goes to war.\nUnfortunately this doesn\u2019t really go according to plan. I won\u2019t say how, as that\nwould ruin the story, but it is really sad\nand provides one of the most atmospheric moments of the show and really\nhelps to brings the message home.\nMain Characters:\nClaude: The all-American conservative ready to join the army; he fancies\nSheila\nBerger: The \u201cfree spirit of the group\u201d,\nhe also fancies Sheila (are there any\nmusicals that don\u2019t contain love\ntriangles?)\nSheila: The \u201cpretty one\u201d who also\nhappens to be rather rich\nHud, Woof, Jeanie, Crissy, Dionne:\nVarious hippy friends of Sheila and\nBerger.\nSongs to look out for:\nFlesh Failures (Let the Sunshine In):\nWithout ruining the plot, I can tell you\nthat this is a really tragic song with so\nmuch emotion; especially if you watch\nit in the film.\nGoing Down: Not the greatest mel-ody, but the YouTube clip I found had\na guy just wearing his trousers and a\nbunch of ties\u2026\nI Got Life: It\u2019s a classic song that\u2019s\nbeen covered by the likes of Nina Simone and can now be found in the\nMuller yogurt adverts.\nWhere can I can get it?\nThe DVD\u2019s still hanging around, but\ndon\u2019t watch it when you\u2019re ill; I did that\nand it felt like I was on a 2 hour trip.\nIf not, there are usually clips of some\nsort on YouTube.\nIf you liked this, try:\nRent \u2013 Same Bohemian ideals centred around the 1980s and the AIDs\ncrisis instead.\nMiss Saigon \u2013 if Hair is the musical\nabout not going to war, Miss Saigon is\nthe flipside of what happened to those\nwho did fight in the Vietnam War.\nThere\u2019s a copy of the original cast recordings of both these musicals in the\nlibrary which I now expect to be completely unobtainable because all you\nlovely people have got them out.\nLove, peace and all that jazz\nSo basically no photos of this musical exist on the internet. So here\nare some hippie-ish pictures. We like reinforcing stereotypes!\nLucy Harrold takes a look at that most iconic Vietnam musical: Hair\n\n"

    "content": "comment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n11\nFriday 15 February 2008 felix\nComment\nOur right to decide on abortion\nO\nn 6th February Ann\nWiddecombe spoke\nin London as part of a\n\u201cpassion for life\u201d speaking tour, reopening the\ndebate about what the time limit for\nabortion should be.\nRight now, women in Britain can request an abortion any time during the\nfirst 24 weeks of pregnancy as long as it\nis approved by two doctors. A minority of women also get an abortion after\nthis time due to very extreme circumstances such as risk to the mother\u2019s life,\naccounting for less than 1% of the total\nabortions carried out.\nThe human fertilisation and embryology bill soon to go through parliament is being used by anti-abortion\ncampaigners in an attempt to lower the\ntime limit to 20 or even 13 weeks. They\nalso seek to introduce more measures\nsuch as a \u201ccooling-off period\u201d of two\nweeks after a woman asks for an abor-tion. Pro-choice MPs are arguing to\nincrease the availability of abortions,\ncutting restrictions (such as the need\nfor two doctor\u2019s signatures) and giving nurses qualifications to carry out\nthe simpler and less-traumatising early\nabortions.\nStudies in countries where abortion\nis outlawed (reported in New Scientist in October 2007) have shown no\ndifference in the number of abortions\ncarried out. Instead, the richest women\nfrom those countries can always hop\non a plane and go somewhere where\nit is allowed. However, the majority\nof women are driven to get backstreet\nabortions or attempt the procedure\nthemselves. This was the case in Britain before the 1967 abortion act; prior\nto this around 100,000 illegal abortions\nwere carried out per year and an estimated 35,000 of them resulted in hos-pitalization. Some women even died as\na result of their injuries.\nUnsurprisingly, people going in to\nWiddecombe\u2019s meeting were met by\nhundreds of angry protestors. It is fundamentally about the rights of women\nto make their own decisions. If someone doesn\u2019t want to have an abortion\nfor religious or moral reasons that\u2019s\nfine, but why should they try to force\ntheir views on everyone else? Antiabortionists have argued that as a foetus can survive outside a woman\u2019s body\nafter a certain point it should be given\nsome of the same rights as an adult. Of\ncourse, adults have the right not to be\nmurdered but no adult has the right to\nuse a woman\u2019s body against that woman\u2019s will in order to sustain their own\nlife. If someone needed a kidney trans-plant, for example, a relative could voluntarily donate a kidney but no one is\narguing that they should be forced to\nby law.\nThere are a couple of other arguments against the anti-abortion lobby.\nFirstly, if a foetus becomes a person at\na certain point during pregnancy, laws\nintended to prevent some abortions\nsuch as the \u201ccooling-off period\u201d will\nmerely introduce more bureaucracy\nmaking it more likely that an abortion\nwill occur after this point. Women do\nnot take the decision to have an abortion lightly; a woman going to the clinic and asking for one will have already\nspent hours deliberating, so it seems\nunlikely that they will change their\nmind in a further two weeks. It just\nmakes the abortion that little bit later.\nSecondly, judging by the reactions of\npeople at Widdecombe\u2019s meeting it is\na joke that they refer to themselves as\npro-life. I got called a \u201cNazi\u201d; they even\nshouted \u201cyou should have been aborted\u201d at one pro-choice campaigner! The\ntactics used by some of these groups\nshow no respect for the lives of some of\nthe most vulnerable people in society,\nincluding the teenage girls and victims\nof rape that often feel that they need an\nabortion. Often they are also the same\npeople that argue against contracep-tion, despite the fact that decent sex\neducation and availability of contraception reduces the number of abortions carried out as well as protecting\nagainst deadly diseases.\nStudents are well placed to fight\nagainst anti-abortion amendments.\nWe not only have the youth and enthusiasm needed but will be uniquely\naffected if the time limits are reduced.\nWe are the least able, both financially\nand in terms of commitments to education and careers, to have children\nand the most able to bring rational arguments based on scientific fact to the\nargument.

Geek\n\u201c\nAs they say,\n\u201cAny idiot can\nsurvive a crisis.\nIt is day-to-day\nliving that wears\nyou out.\u201d\nWarning: Contains emotion\nCamilla Royle\nA\nclose family member was\ndiagnosed with cancer\nlast week. That will be\nthe second diagnosis\nI\u2019ve seen in my family in\neighteen months. Sympathies aside,\nit\u2019s become pretty mundane now. It\u2019s\nsurprising how quickly such things\nbecome trivial. Tears. Fear of the tel-ephone. Hospital wards. Unassuming\nsmiles. I travelled home, as all good\nfamily members do. A couple of hours\non the train, and you\u2019re on holiday\nagain.\nThe train ride I take back is important to every journey home. The route\nI take melts London slowly out, like a\nboiled sweet, instead of amputating\nit with a thick swathe of countryside.\nSlowly, the greenery that I\u2019m more accustomed to blends through like an\nAir Wick made of grass. But once you\nnear the urban centres dotted around\nmy hometown, that feeling of bland\nemotional deadness sets in. It\u2019s that\nscene in every independent film where\nthe protagonist returns to the site of\ntheir childhood. It is grey. That\u2019s the\nproblem with illness. It\u2019s just so bloody\ndepressing.\nThe journey home is never nearly as\nbad as home itself, of course. Eighteen\nmonths of cancer has the same effect\non the house as it does on the sufferer.\nThings become greyer, the signs of life\nunder the surface begin to fade and go\ncold. You look for successes on a daily\nbasis, rather than measuring things in\n\u201cten-kays\u201d or percentages. Things become more real.\nWe were feeling lucky, in fact. Our\nfirst sufferer in the family is doing well,\nallowing that taste of happiness to return to food, television and shopping.\nEven though there were still gloomy\nconversations to be had, fewer and\nfewer people bore witness to them over\nthe four months past. A second case in\nthe family, though, was something of a\nmood breaker.\nThe man in question is my mother\u2019s\nfather, an eighty-four year-old chap\nwho worked three days a week full\ntime at a metalworker\u2019s, cooked roast\nbeef every Sunday, and last Thursday\ncollapsed at his home and was rushed\nto hospital. He was found to have a tumour the size of a tennis ball attached\nto his kidney. They had no idea what\nto do.\nStatistically, something like one in\nthree people have their lives affected\nby cancer, either directly or indirectly.\nAs we all know, though, statistics rarely work out. I\u2019ve been affected three\ntimes, and given that both sides of my\nfamily are now sporting tumours, I\nmay face an even more direct experience of the illness in the future.\nAnd so the weekend left some interesting questions cluttering up my\ntravel bag on the journey home. Will\nmy wife have to watch me die? Will\nmy children carry the same chance\nwith them, too? Yet, there\u2019s the mundane feel I mentioned. Just as the lush\ngreenery began to repeat itself after\na few identical fields, so too do these\nquestions and ideas.\nI\u2019m sure we all feel the same. It\u2019s February at Imperial \u2013 and, indeed, everywhere else. The sun is unusual and\nall too strong, making the days feel\nextremely long. Added to that, coursework has become so dull and predictable that it begins to feel like a Nike\nproduction line, shuffling linear systems problems past lines of low-paid\nchildren who are just looking to survive to the next term.\nThe trick is to do the clich\u00e9d thing,\nand keep that head above water, those\neyes on the horizon, and so on. As I\u2019ve\nbeen told by so many family members,\nin their situation it is only possible to\nlive one day at a time. But that\u2019s generally the best way to be anyway. Whether you\u2019re battling a terminal illness or\nfighting to scrape a third-class degree.\nToday is all you can live at the moment.\nSod the interviews for that City job.\nForget planning your entrepreneurial\nsummer of innovation. It\u2019s the worst\ntime of the year, right now, and there\u2019s\nonly one way through it.\nMuch like my secret love of Avril\nLavigne, and the fact that I have a pseudonym in Felix, few people at Imperial\nknow that my family has such trouble.\nThose that do, say that we are \u201cstrong\u201d\nto go through it, but there aren\u2019t really\nmany other options open. What can be\nharder is to keep going to four years of\nexams and study, with debts piling up\nand no certainty of what you want to\nspend the future doing anyway.\nAs they say: \u201cAny idiot can survive a\ncrisis. It is day-to-day living that wears\nyou out.\u201d Chin up this February, and\nMarch will seem that much sweeter\nfor it.\nFelix stalwart Gilead Amit tells me\nhe is writing about me this week. I read\nthe piece (sorry, Gilead) ahead of time\nthanks to my contacts. What he wrote\ninitially made me think twice about\nputting this out to you. But then, after\nsome thought, made me even more\nsure that it is the right thing to do. Not\nbecause I want you to see a vulnerable\nside of me \u2013 you\u2019re still all jackasses,\ndon\u2019t worry \u2013 but because I want you\nto know that even the coldest bastard\nholds a burden somewhere in their\npack. If any of you out there are affected by cancer, and fancy chatting to\nsomeone in confidence; indeed, if any\nof you have anything to say about my\ncolumns at all, I have an email address\nthat was until now reserved for sending things to the Editor. I would like to\nopen it to you all: anangrygeek@goog-lemail.com.\nThomas Lofthouse died in the early\nhours of the 12th February 2008. He\nwas a Second World War veteran, a\ntaxi driver, a metalworker, and an in-spiration. He will not be forgotten.\nYou have been warned... ;_:\n\n"

Scotland, yet again, relied on the boot to get their points, and\nfor some reason haven\u2019t really realised\nthat tries get them more points. Wales\nwere very lucky to get Shane Williams\u2019\ntry allowed since his left foot was clearly in-touch, but it did prove to be the\ncatalyst for Wales and they pulled away\nwith the win.\nLater on in the day, hot favourites\nFrance had an amazing start against\nIreland, with Vincent Clerc getting\na hat-trick within the first half that\nseemed to leave Ireland stunned. After\nlast week\u2019s poor performance, Ireland\nhad to show signs of improvement and\nthis was evident with their second-half performance where they were extremely unlucky not to win the game. It\njust went to show that if France are put\nunder pressure, they will crumble.\nThe last of the Six Nations matches\nwas between Italy and England. England were expected to win this game\nand dramatically improve their second -half performance against Wales\nlast week. The game got off to a great\nstart with some glamorous play between Wilkinson and Sackey for the\nopening try, and then again with Flood\nwhere Wilkinson got his 1,000th point.\nYet the second-half was the let down\nonce more for England, and Italy\nwere allowed to get within 4 points of\nEngland.\nThe Football Association are considering the thought of having Premiership games played overseas, in order to\nbring the \u2018Beautiful Game\u2019 to a wider\naudience. For now, it seems that the\nMiddle East, Far East and America\nhave shown the most amount of interest in hosting some games. This week\nalso saw the commemoration of the\nMunich Air Crash where 23 lives were\nclaimed in 1958, when Manchester\nUnited were returning from a European Cup match against Red Star Belgrade. To add to the United fan\u2019s horror this week, the team went on to lose\nthe Manchester Derby, blaming their\nloss on \u2018fatigue\u2019. Man up!\nProblems have already begun with\nthe Olympics with athletes having to\nsign a contract preventing them from\nmaking any political statements whilst\nin Beijing. The British Olympic Association has said that they would look\ninto the wording of the contract, since\nthey believe this to be against the nature of the Olympic Games. Sticking\nwith athletics, Dwain Chambers the\nGreat Britain selectors have received a\nlot of criticism for selecting Chambers\nfor the Indoor Championships. Chambers was convicted of doping in 2003\nand has served his two-year ban. However the athletics community is still\nunhappy with allowing him back since\nit goes against the ethics of the sport.\nImperial\u2019s cl-ass\nThe Hockey Club work their way through to the ULU Semi-finals.\nSee page 44\nHockey\nBUSA\nBucks Women\u2019s 1st 0\nImperial Women\u2019s 2nd 2\nOne cold Wednesday, a team of intrepid hockey players set out along the\nMetropolitan line on the long, arduous\njourney to Zone C, otherwise known\nas No Man\u2019s Land. Upon arrival at the\ntiny train station of Chalfont and Latimer, we all walked positively out of the\nstation towards a likely place for a bus\nstop\u2026 except there wasn\u2019t one. Slowly\nthe team began to disperse in search of\nthe elusive stopping point, very much\naware our game was due to start in\nunder half an hour. This led to Easyjet\nremarking, \u2018I\u2019ve seen that film\u2026. They\nall die.\u2019 After much searching and Ho\nHa offering her services to an old lady\nin the station, the bus stop was discovered and a bus arrived.\nSadly it only had space for eight people and three courageous individuals\nremained behind to wait for the bus to\ncome back, namely Spandex, Easyjet\nand FreeWheeler. Their dedication to\ntheir sport became evident when they\nelected to change into their hockey kit\nat the bus stop on a busy road! MeanArabella Walker\nwhile, the rest of the team arrived at\nthe pitch and got the bus driver very\nexcited with talk of a pitch-side clothes\nchange. The other three arrived just in\ntime for the game to start.\nThe first half saw us settling into the\ngame with a few stretched passes and\na general lack of enthusiasm on both\nsides. A more defensive tact taken by\neach team meant there were a lot of\nnear misses, mainly by us, with no re-sult. The half time score showed this\nby remaining at a rather pathetic goalless draw.\nA rousing half time chat saw aggression mount and the game began to get\ninteresting. Passes were more accurate\nand there was more action in the D.\nFinally, a well-aimed hit from the right\nby Unicycle was finished with style by\nFreeWheeler into the goal. This was\nfollowed a few minutes later with another free hit on the left aimed at AA\non the right post who deflected it deftly to give us a two- nil lead. Throughout the game, the defence consisting of\nThombelina, Three Times a Lady and\nSpandex kept the number attempts on\nour goal to a minimum. Defence was\nso good, goalie Spanner got very excited when the ball came remotely near\nher feet and decided it would be great\nfun to lie on the ground in front of an\nattacking player and give the other\nteam a short corner. Hilarity continued\noff the pitch with a naughty comment\nabout Thombelina\u2019s shampoo mess in\nthe changing room by Three Times a\nLady.\nFines were carried out on the long\njourney back into the Big Smoke.\n\u2018Twat of the Match\u2019 was awarded to\nFreeWheeler for trying to be clever in\nchanging out of her skorts into trousers and forgetting about the whole\nshorts part.\n\u2018Man of the Match\u2019 was awarded to\nUnicycle for God-knows what reason\nand Ducky was put into her care for the\nnight. Probably a bad idea considering\nthe amount the \u2018Man of the Match\u2019 had\nto drink!\nTwo of the hockey ladies after getting changed at the bus stop\n\n"

Fearing the Anglican Church may be put\nthrough more trouble and internal\nstrife, Dr. Williams clarified his comments by stating that he \u201ccertainly did\nnot call for [sharia law\u2019s] introduction\nas some kind of parallel jurisdiction\nto the civil law\u201d. Many have rallied to\nsupport Dr. Williams; Bishop Lowe\nclaimed him to be \u201cprobably one of the\ngreatest and the brightest Archbishops\nof Canterbury\u201d.\nHowever, calls for Dr. William\u2019s resignation have been coming from all\nsides, including many from within the\nAnglican Church. Branded a \u201cdisaster\u201d\nby one synod member and with 150\ntraditionalist members of the General\nSynod ready to sign an open letter\ndistancing themselves from the comments of Dr. Williams, the Archbishop\nwas under some pressure when he addressed the General Synod on Monday. In this address he apologised for\ncausing confusion but stood behind\nthe original comments, adding: \u201cI believe quite strongly that it is not inappropriate for a pastor of the Church\nof England to address issues about the\nperceived concerns of other religious\ncommunities, and to try and bring\nthem into better public focus\u201d. This\nstatement should be praised as it can\nonly help keep all faiths and cultures\nincluded in society. Part of the \u201cburden\nand the privilege of being the Church\u201d\nin the UK meant, Dr Williams said, the\nChurch needed \u201csome coherent voice\non behalf of all the faith communities\nliving here\u201d. Without this it is possible\nthat social integration will break down\nand there will be no-go areas for people of differing faiths, as the Bishop\nof Rochester, the Right Reverend Dr.\nMichael Nazir-Ali, has already suggested exist. Dr. Williams stressed the\nimportance of different faiths working together so that all can live in this\ncountry peacefully and legally, sharing\ncommon ideals. These sentiments are\nechoed amongst many groups and the\ngeneral public, but unfortunately not\nin the traditionalist camp within the\nAnglican Church. Despite two synod\nmembers calling for Dr. Williams\u2019\nresignation, the Archbishop still has a\nmajority of support within the council and the support of some revered\nfigures \u2013 Lord Carey, Dr. Williams\u2019s\npredecessor, being one; it is unlikely at\ntime of writing that Dr. Williams will\nbe forced to resign.\nSome politicians, who have been\nriled before by Dr. Williams\u2019s calls for\nthe religious to get involved in political debate, have spoken out against the\nArchbishop getting involved; Geoff\n\u201cThere are\nalready religious\ncourts in this\ncountry\u201d\n\u201c40% of British\nMuslims\nwelcome Sharia\nLaw\u201d\nHoon, chief whip for the government,\nsuggesting he should not comment on\nsuch \u201ccomplicated legal matters\u201d. However, the Prime Minister has called Dr.\nWilliams a man of \u201cgreat integrity\u201d\nand believes religious law should be\nsubservient to UK law. This can be the\nonly way any inclusion of religious law\ncan work in the British legal system as,\ndespite the links between the Church\nand State, any persons who wish to impose their own laws into this country\nhave to do so through the progressively\nsecularised parliament, including the\nintroduction of any type of religious\nlaw. Without this safeguard, parallel\njudiciaries will be created, removing\nthe one body of law with possible disastrous consequences\nIn a Church divided by other issues,\nthe damage has already been done,\nforcing the Anglican Church into more\nturmoil. The debate will no doubt con-tinueandwhilesomeclaimtheonlyway\nto preserve a multicultural Britain is to\nbow to the pressure of religious groups\nfor integration of their laws, many see\nthis route as dangerous for the legal\nrights of the UK\u2019s citizens.

The\nRepublican race is over in all but name,\nwith John McCain the clear winner. Although Mike Huckabee remains in the\nrace as a credible conservative, there is\nsimply no question of him winning the\nnomination. This isn\u2019t to say that the\nrace has become dull and uninterest-ing, quite the opposite.\nAs bizarre and strange as it might\nsound, John McCain is not actually\nliked by many Republicans. Conservatives within the Republican Party, remembering that the Republican Party\nis a conservative party, are either suspicious of him or even despise John\nMcCain.\nWhether or not the party can force\nthemselves to unite, and be seen as\nconvincing to the U.S. electorate, in\ntime for the presidential elections is\nuncertain and will create controversy\nin the near future. However, discussing\nthe Republican Party is not the object\nof this article: it is to chew over a much\nmore interesting question.

Imagine Hillary Clinton\nwinning the nomination and then\nchoosing Barack Obama as her running mate, her vice president. Or of\ncourse, vice-versa; somebody\u2019s got to\nwin, but in this terribly close race to secure the democratic nomination, does\nthere necessarily have to be a loser?\nThe idea of these Democrat heavyweights joining in political matrimony\nhas been floating almost sinfully in\nthe minds of Democratic activists and\nmembers for some time now, but has\nnot been formally aired as a possibil-Senator Barack Obama has a large base of support amongst students.\nity.

    "content": "arts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n23\nFriday 15 February 2008 felix\nArts\nsibility, most architects draw and don\u2019t\ndo much else. There must be countless ideas for expanding the traditional\nnotion of a high-rise \u2013 from phalluses\nand intertwining twin-towers to reverse \u201cunderground skyscrapers\u201d \u2013 but\nthe CCTV Building has actually gone\nahead.\nDesigned by Rem Koolhaas \u2013 the\nmaster himself \u2013 and the Office of\nMetropolitan Architecture (OMA),\nthe new headquarters will combine administration with news, broadcasting,\nstudios and program production in a\nsequence of interconnected activities,\nforming an integrated site for the entire process of production. Although\nthe building is 230 metres tall, it is not\na traditional tower but a continuous\nloop of horizontal and vertical sections\nthat establish a site rather than a typical leap for the stars.\nBeijing International Airport\nThe venerable Sir Norman Foster continues his legacy with this, possibly his\nmost jaw-dropping project to date, at\nleast in terms of scale. The figures: US\n$2 billion. 60 million passengers. One\nsingle terminal, yet larger than all the\nterminals in Heathrow. Combined.\nWorking with structural engineering firm Arup, the terminal will be\nbuilt to accommodate the massive influx of traffic from China\u2019s joining of\nA more muted shade of spectacular \u2013 the Beijing National Stadium\nNo, it\u2019s not the world\u2019s largest electric guitar, it\u2019s Foster & Partners\u2019 new Beijing International Airport\nthe World Trade Organisation (WTO)\nand the Olympics.\nBesides looking supremely menac-ing, the terminal will be the world\u2019s\nmost sustainable, incorporating design\nconcepts such as skylights orientated\nto maximise heat in the early morning sun and integrated environmental\ncontrol systems minimising energy\nconsumption and carbon emissions.\nIf that sounds a bit airy fairy \u2013 considering the massive amount of resources and capital being poured into\nthe project \u2013 at least take solace in\nthe prospect that such technology will\ntrickle down to an equivalent domestic\nsetting eventually, even if we\u2019re all under water by then\u2026\nNational Theatre, Beijing\nThe Beiijing National Theatre was\nconceptualised by the French architect\nPaul Andreu as a huge dome of glass\nand titanium rising imposingly from\nthe still of an artificial lake. In a central part of town with a high density of\nlandmarks, the clash of the modernised\nwith the traditional can feel incongruous at times, but there is no doubting\nAndreu\u2019s ambition in rivalling nearby\nTiananmen Square and the Forbidden\nCity.\nThe project has been criticised as being about as Chinese as rarebit and excessively costly. In his defence, Andreu\nlikened the situation to the initial outrage at I.M.Pei\u2019s glass pyramid at the\nLouvre, which is now celebrated and\ninternationally recognised \u2013 it is only\na matter of time and familiarity, he ar-gues. Communist leaders wanted the\ntheatre to symbolise China\u2019s arrival as\na modern, advanced nation, and they\nhave something to that effect.\nBut both sides of the argument have\nhuge weight. Though it is no doubt\ndaring and innovative, perhaps it is too\ndaring for a part of the city that has\nalways wielded the power of the entire nation. As with many of the other\ndesigns, it has brought up questions of\nidentity - how much can you sacrifice\nto move forward? What does it truly\nmeans to be Chinese? Time will tell.\n\n"

    "content": "sport.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n44 Friday 15 February 2008\nfelix\nSport\nIt has been another amazing couple\nof matches for the Imperial Women\u2019s\nVolleyball team. The team confidently\ndominated their league, remaining un-beaten. This means promotion to the\nfirstdivisionnextyearandqualification\nto the Trophy knockouts held in mid-February. Making the most of trainings and with strong determination all\nthe girls have succeeded in becoming,\nfrom a bunch of strangers, a tight team\nenjoying their performances on court\nwhile also having a blast.\nThe second term started with a victory against LSE on 23/01, who ended\nup Second in the League. The match\nallowed excellent practice against a\ntough team. The final league game was\nthat against ULU\u2019s second team which\ntook place on Wednesday 30th January. The first two sets went by smoothly with no difficulty in securing the\nrequired 25 points with some amazing\nhits. Notwithstanding ULU\u2019s efforts\nto come back up and some amazing\nreception and digs on their side, our\nattack proved superior in a tight 3rd\nset \u2013 which went all the way up to 28-26 for IC! Players match report cards\nfollow:\nAlana: Silver service. Pivotal in opening up ULU\u2019s defences through middle\nattacks. One of her hits is so fast that 3\ndifferent opposition players near-miss\nit. She gets blocked once, shrugs it off,\ngets the next ball faster from setter and\nhits it in. She appears somewhat overheated at the end of match \u2013 possibly\nas a way of trying to be comforted by\nTim.\nAshly: Lazy but deadly. Asked by the\ncoach to set closer to the net, immediately adjusts and keeps on feeding\ngreat sets to the whole team. She then\nproceeds to strike fear of God into the\nother team with nifty unexpected tips.\nAnd all of this without even running or\ntalking that much...\nCecile: Strong debut on the outside.\nReady to serve the first ball of the\nmatch and from then on it\u2019s a set of\nbombs \u2013 very valuable in gaining leads\nover the opposition. She settles in nice\nwith the rotations and hits with precision and power.\nEmily: The hand of god. Reliable left-handed hits from middle and very confident passes. When back-court she\nleads the defence and makes sure the\nsetter does not have to run much (see\nabove).\nKarin: Flying girl. She delivers the\nfirst mighty hit spot on the line. And\nseveral more \u2013 contributing to crushing ULU\u2019s hopes. Then makes way\nfor others in team and supports team\nfrom the bench, while enjoying a well-deserved rest. One to watch.\nKat: Captain courageous. Good performance throughout. I think I even\nsaw her dive. She supplies plenty of\nsmooth passes and exudes the usual\nconfidence to the team. In the third set\nshe is returned to family& friends.\nNadia: Most elegant player. Sweet attacks from the outside. You can tell by\nthe way she warms up jumping while\nwaiting on the sidelines it\u2019s going to be\na blast. Comes in for the second set,\nimmediately ready to hit.\nRebecca: Found in translation. She\nplays in two different positions in the\nlast two sets \u2013 very tricky task \u2013 and\ndelivers well. She starts as outside hitter and leaves a mark. Then moved to\nopposite, where she works well covering the setter. Great dives throughout\nLadies Volleyball finish the season on a high\nKaterina Tsangaris\nVolleyball\nBUSA\nImperial Women\u2019s 1st 3\nLSE Women\u2019s 1st 0\nVolleyball\nBUSA\nImperial Women\u2019s 1st 3\nULU Women\u2019s 2nd 0\nthe final heated exchanges.\nValentina: Safe pair of hands. Patiently snoozing on the sidelines for a while.\nThen she is in and off to serve. A series\nof masterly accurate short serves digs\na hole in ULU\u2019s reception and sweeps\naway any hopes of catching up. And I\nthink I saw her dive too\u2026\nIC setting up another point\nHaving been gifted a Bye in the first\nround, a win in this match would see\nIC safely through to the semi-finals in\na fortnight\u2019s time. With a number of\nplayers out through injury and other\ncommitments, it was a somewhat reshuffled team which took the field,\nbut that didn\u2019t stop us from playing\nour usual style of expansive, attacking hockey. Shipman suffered a suspected broken thumb playing for UL\non Sunday but he manned up for the\nteam and despite not really being able\nto hold a stick properly offered to play\ngoal-hanger role. This was seen by all\nother players as a ploy to force Captain\nCrusty to play him up front, it worked.\nIt soon became apparent that IC were\nby far the better team and Holloway\nwere continually being reprimanded\nfor stick-tackles, dangerous play and\nno-end of foot-fouls. Eventually the\nHolloway number 10 saw yellow after\nattempting to mount Date Rape from\nbehind. DR seemed to make himself a\nmagnet for swinging Holloway sticks\nand before long more cards had to be\nshown the dirty-tricks Holloway mid-field. Not happy with petty fouls, the\nopposition went one step too far. Skull\nF**k, having a top game in midfield\nwas impaled from close range by an attempted aerial and had to be patched\nup and sent off for a couple of hours\nwait in A&E. IC played on with just\n10 men, but refused to let the deficit\nHockey men scrape through\nto semi-finals on penalties\nHockey\nULU Cup\nImperial Men\u2019s 1st 2\nRoyal Holloway Men\u2019s 1st 1\nQwen Connick\nshow with every man working hard for\neach other. At half time the score was\nstill locked at 0-0 and we knew that we\nshould have been 3 or 4 and comfortably away but there was a lot of work\nstill to do.\nHolloway started positively and produced some of their best counter-at-tacking play as IC (still outnumbered)\npushed forward in search of a goal\nand became increasingly frustrated\nwith their inability to finish an attack\noff. And then they scored. Now a goal\ndown and a man down, IC had to find\nsomething special to get back into the\ngame- and that something special is\nDr. Harold Shipman. IC broke from\ndefence with Mountie bringing the ball\nout wide on the right and firing a long\npass to Shipman who\u2019d made good\nspace for himself on the left of the Opposition 25. With some silky magic he\nwaltzed past his marker, into the D and\nhit an absolute rocket reverse stick\nshot into the top right corner, leaving\nthe Holloway keeper for dead.\nThat levelled the score at 1-1 but IC\ncontinued to push forward in search\nof the winner, leaving inevitable gaps\nat the back. Plug pulled off some top-drawer saves in the IC goal, helped by\nMountie with a goal-line clearance and\nfirst-class work rate from every member of the team. After 70 minutes, the\nteams were still even and it had to be\ndecided by penalty flicks.\nAfter five flicks from each side the\nscores were still even and it went to\nsudden death. Blondie from Holloway\nbottled it and so, cometh the hour,\ncometh the man, Diana stepped up to\nthe spot. Calmly, casually collecting\nthe ball placing it carefully on the spot\nand then fiercely firing it past the flailing keeper, Diana sealed the match for\nIC and secured our place in the Semi\nfinals.\nDiana with the winning P-flick\nHockey girls easily\nthrough to semi\u2019s\nDespite the IC Ladies\u2019 impressive\nrecord in the ULU Cup, it proved difficult to get a team together for what\nwould be a windy and exciting day at\nFortress Harlington - Myra was una-vailable, having joined the DeIViants\non tour in Amsterdam, and Preying\nMantis was occupied with family busi-ness. Kebab was dragged back from a\ndirty weekend in Bristol to play and\nLeper had to play, despite having a\nyounger sister visiting from across the\nIrish Sea \u2013 what does she mean there\nare better things to see in London than\nIC Ladies 1s play hockey?! Meanwhile,\nDominator helped out the defence for\nthe second time in a week.\nIt was already a nerve-wracking day\nbefore the match even started \u2013 the\nMen\u2019s 1st XI were also playing Royal\nHolloway in their quarter final at Harlington, so there was lots of shouting,\ne.g. \u201c Give me an I! Give me a C! What\ndoes it spell? IC!\u201d JD attempted to start\na team talk during the last few minutes\nof what was already a tense game \u2013 this\nwas a mistake, as nobody listened, but\nthe adrenalin and support were good\npreparation.\nIC were the stronger team from the\nbeginning and were soon 1-0 up. The\nLadies showed their class, and continued to dominate the game, although,\ndespite their form, seemed to have difficulty converting chances into goals.\nHalf-time was upbeat, and the second\nhalf started off with the same intensity\nas the first. Unluckily, Royal Holloway\nequalised, but this was short-lived, as\nIC put another two in the back of the\nnet \u2013 a hat-trick for T*tw*nk.\nWith five minutes to go, MJ\u2019s shoulder became dislocated and she had to\ngo off \u2013 IC were left without a goalie!\nThe remaining few minutes were\nplayed with 11 outfield and IC managed to hold the scoreline despite some\nthreats. Their form in the ULU Cup\ncontinues and they are ready for UCL\nin the Semis next week!\nSiobhan Kohli-lynch\nHockey\nULU Cup\nImperial Women\u2019s 1st 3\nRoyal Holloway Women\u2019s 1st 1\nMore ass! P\n.S. Deborah has a great ass (She told me to say that!)\n\n"

    "content": "34 felix Friday 15 February 2008\nfashion.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFashion\nCall the engines, Camden\u2019s burning\nWell, not anymore, but the smell of singed Goths is still in the air. Daniel Wan loves their smelly ways\nA\ns news broke of the blaze\nthat adorned Camden\nHigh Street, a very stark\nsense of disbelief came\nover me. Described as a\n\u201csevere fire\u201d that spanned over a large\narea, from the Canal Market to just\neast of Chalk Farm Road, this wasn\u2019t a\ncase of just one or two buildingsbeing\nset alight but a good 300-metre stretch\nof one of the busiest marketplaces in\nLondon.\nAnyone who has visited Camden can\nadmitthemarketstallswereonebigfire\nhazard, but the locals and visitors had\nbigger problems to think about. However, now it has actually happened, the\nfuture of Camden market holds an element of uncertainty about it; and this\nis where the real worries lie.\nCamden Market is not only a major\nhotspot for tourism in London, but\nalso an icon of subculture and all fashion that falls beneath the definition\nof \u2018alternative\u2019. Since its birth in 1974,\nCamden Market has grown to attract\nover 300,000 visitors each weekend\nfrom every part of the world. Londoners and tourists alike flock to the five\ndifferent markets in Camden to shop\nfor that special one-off item; something they weren\u2019t really looking for\nwhen they arrived but merely stumbled upon during ferocious furrowing\ninto the eclectic mass of second-hand\nclothing.\nIt is exactly in this that Camden exhibits its very own magic; inspiring\ncreativity and originality in millions\nacross the globe. Thrift, army-surplus,\nand handmade stalls littered Camden\nMarket, providing no guarantee of a\ngood find on any day, but anyone that\nloves the Market loves it because they\nhave found something special there.\nThat something that no one else has.\nDespite such self-built success, in\n2006 Camden Council decided to cash\nin on the already money-spinning\ntourism trade. The Stables market was\nredeveloped into a more commercial\nand modern setting for stalls. Despite\nstrong opposition from local residents,\nwho argued it would tarnish Camden\u2019s\nquaint character, plans went ahead and\nthe death of Camden Market began\nwith an upscale restaurant placed slap-bang in the middle of The Stables.\nHowever, the spirit of Camden\nprevailed and for the past two years\nCamden has managed to retain its\never-popular grotty-but-you-love-it\natmosphere. On closer inspection,\nstalls have become almost identical;\nthe same sunglasses and bags for sale\nand only a different bloke desperately\nyelling \u201cI give you good price\u201d.\nThings are now doubling in price,\nand stall owners have become more\nlike shopkeepers. Long gone are the\ndays when a rather questionable fellow\nwould run through the market with\nthe shirt you had a quick poke at in his\nstall, trying to endear you further into\nbuying it.\nOn Saturday the 9th of February, the\nfires hit Camden Town at around 7pm.\nAt the time of writing, the cause is still\nunknown and there have been no casu-alties. This is starting to sound like a\nworld-changing atrocity, and in your\neyes it may not seem anywhere near\nas serious, but for the 300-odd market and shop traders, their livelihood\nhas been taken away for an indefinite\namount of time.\nWill Camden Council use the recent\nevents as a good excuse to regenerate the affected area, if not the whole\nmarket, into a fresh and contemporary\nhigh street? If these suspicions are\ntrue, Fashion has lost its rebel son.\nSome are already speculating wild\nbut almost-believable conspiracy the-ories. Looking at what has occurred\nobjectively, there were further plans\nto regenerate the whole of Camden\nHigh Street and its markets despite\nextremely strong local disapproval. A\nwidespread fire causes damage to a\nlarge portion of the market area, but\nevades the recently Council-renovated\nStables Market, as well as avoiding a\nsingle casualty. Put the facts together\nand you can see why some people are\npeeved.\nDespite living a one and a half hour\ntube journey away from Camden, I still\nspent my weekends growing up there.\nMy teenage years have been set upon\nthegrimystreetsofCamden,andifIdid\nnot have those wonderful hours wasting away on the Lock watching Punks,\nMetalheads and others go by, I reckon\nI would be dressing like any other Tom,\nDick and Harry on the streets. There\nwere no Topshops or River Islands,\nand that was the best thing about it all.\nCamden inspired a sense of rebellious\nimagination in me, and if the Council\nhas its savage way with Camden, I will\nbe of the last generation to be inspired\nby the true Camden Market.\nLondon Fashion Week\nSarah\u2019s the envy of everyone\nand wangled her way into the\nLondon Fashion Week\u2019s exhibitions this week. Free champagne appaprently. Hmph.\nBoots No.7 Men\u2019s Range\nSkin and face creams for the\nmore metrosexual of men.\nAnti Fatigue Eye Stick?

The Sex Pistols are all\non zimmer frames, whilst the\nRamones are collecting their\npensions.

    "content": "6 felix Friday 15 February 2008\nI\nn Tottenham Court Road the barrier enclosure that has now been\nerected for the protesters is already full. Some of the masks I recognise from Blackfriars, some I do not. Outside the Scientology building\nthere stand two tables stacked with \u201cDianetics\u201d books (the \u201cscientific\u201d\nbasis for Scientology that L. Ron Hubbard published in 1950 on \u201cThe\nModern Science of Mental Health\u201d. A book which rejects psychology and accepted science) and offering the infamous \u201cfree stress tests.\u201d\nOne of our reporters quickly asks for a stress test. He is asked some questions by another man in a black suit/red tie combination, who wears a per-ma-smile and strangely glazed eyes, whilst he grips the \u201cE-meter\u201d probes. He\nis then taken inside the building for a chat, after which he buys the \u201cDianetics\u201d book. Our reporter is curious as to what is really contained in this \u2018bible\u2019\nof Scientology.\nAnother member of our reporting team asks for a stress test. The nice man\nwith the glazed eyes welcomes her, but immediately after she is taken into\nthe building, she is stopped by a woman who appears to be in charge of the\n\u201cLife Improvement Centre\u201d. The woman labels her a \u201ctroublemaker,\u201d and tells\nthe man with glazed eyes to keep her at the front of the shop. He duly gives\nher the stress test, but after some hushed words between him and the woman in charge, she is asked to leave by the woman. \u201cI can tell you for certain\nthat these people are criminals and terrorists and are here to incite violence\nagainst Scientology,\u201d she tells our reporter.\nThe \u201cLife Improvement Centre\u201d is next door to a casino and KFC (Leading\nto chants of \u201cChicken, Cult, Chicken, Cult\u201d with comic pointing) on one side,\nand a Ryman\u2019s on the other. The police are here in force, this time from the\nMetropolitan Police. I count at least 25-30 officers and 3 police vans. They\nherd the protesters into the barrier enclosure to prevent blocking the street,\nkeeping them all on the opposite side of the street. We stand near the other\npress: Sky News, BBC London, ARTE (a French television company), and\nvarious freelance photographers. An older man with red hair issues a press\nrelease to the media. \u201cWe are working with police to minimise the negative\nimpact of the terrorist activity,\u201d he says. This is the second time that members of the church have referred to the protesters as terrorists in under ten\nminutes.\nTwo scientologists stand opposite the protesters, handing out pro-Dian-etics and anti-psychiatry leaflets to passers-by. Leaflets that they call a \u201cfree\nnewspaper.\u201d The building is now locked down. Only members are allowed\nin, the public are barred after a few protesters were accidentally allowed in-side. Mark has arrived, and stands on the outskirts, watching. He seems less\ncheerful than in our previous encounter.\nThe scientologists glance at the protesters with carefully unconcerned\ndisdain. The protesters continue their chanting. They wave and dance and\nshout. They hold signs that say \u201cHonk if you hate the Church of Scientology\n(sorry if we made you late!)\u201d and cheer loudly when motorists beep, which\nthey frequently do. They do not look like terrorists. The protestors chant\n\u201cRip it up!\u201d to the passers-by who are handed leaflets. There are loud cheers\nwhen, as several pedestrians follow the request, the leaflets are torn up.\nBefore I leave, over five hours after the protest started, I speak to the man\nwith the glazed eyes and explain that I\u2019m student press covering the protests,\nand would like a tour inside the building. He asks for my name and phone\nnumber so that someone can call me later in the week to arrange it. As I go\nover to Tom to get a piece of paper, the man with glazed eyes is called over\nby the woman in charge, who speaks quietly to him. I go back and hand him\nthe paper with my first name and the Felix office phone number. He tells me\nhis name is Felix, I tell him that that\u2019s the name of the student paper that I\nwork for.\n\u201cThat\u2019s funny,\u201d he said, with a still glazed and smiling expression, \u201cI googled\nmy name recently and read something that Felix published on Scientology a\nfew weeks ago.\u201d\nB\ny now it\u2019s about 12:30pm and the protest in Queen Victoria\nStreet is at its peak. At least 500 people (both by police count\nand my own approximations) stand in a wall of masks and\nsigns, chattering and cracking jokes at Scientology\u2019s expense.\nA small conflict breaks out between two protesters and the police who are trying to move them away from the main entrance. The police\npush them, and they push back. The crowd sides with the police, shouting\nas one peaceful entity for the rogue members to fall back into the Anonymous crowd. \u201cFall Back!\u201d they cry, \u201cNo loss of hit points!\u201d \u201cCalm down!\nStay calm, stay cool!\u201d and my personal favourite: \u201cLet\u2019s all have a nice cup\nof tea!\u201d This was the resolute character of the protests: peaceful, with the\nsmiling knife of humour as their weapon.\nThe two men return to the protest side of the road. They talked to me\nbriefly about an encounter that they had at the rear of the building. They\nspoke of walking to the door of the rear entrance and protesting by that.\nOf security guards telling them that the alley was private property, then\nchanging their minds when challenged, of being threatened until the police arrived, and then being filmed by police.\nThe protesters continue for the next half an hour, until someone makes\nan announcement that the protest will reconvene at 2pm outside the Tottenham Court Road branch of the CoS, its \u201cLife Improvement Centre.\u201d\nAs I leave to follow the rapidly dispersing crowd to the final stop, I see\nprotesters wandering around, picking up dropped flyers. \u201cWe don\u2019t want\nto get done for littering,\u201d they say. The last thing I see in Queen Victoria\nStreet is a police officer taking down the flyers stuck to the windows of the\nbuilding as he said that they were here to \u201cprotect a commercial business.\u201d\nA statement of fact after the failure of Scientology to gain \u2018charity\u2019 status\nhere in the UK.\nA scientology spokesman speaks to Franco-German television station ARTE about the \u201cterrorist activity\u201d\nThe Dianetics & Scientology Life Improvement Centre on Tottenham Court Road, next door to a casino\n\n"

His performance consisted\nof playing songs from his album \u201cAlong\nthe Dusty Road\u201d, with an acoustic gui-tar, keyboard and singer.\nThe grand finale, The Time Has\nCome, started with the well known\nsinging of the Circle of Life, and told\nthe story of a journey from the Savannah to the Street through a variety of\ndance and music styles, including Fat\nBoy Slim. It ended with the entire cast\non stage, including the committee and\nartistic team. A great end to an absolutely spectacular show. It was a truly\nmesmerizing show, and I couldn\u2019t believe the level of talent that I had seen.\nNot only was the evening an extremely successful showcase of talent,\nbut it raised over \u00a311,000 to be split\nequally between the three charities\nsupported by the Indian Society. The\ntheme of the East Meets West 2008\ncharities was supporting youth and\nchildren around the world. The chosen\nthree causes look to aid not only those\nin India and UK, but the whole world,\nand are: Plan India, Save the Children\nand Friends of Michael Sobell House.\nThe Indian Society have collaborated\nwith the IC Save the Children Society\nand the Raising and Giving (RAG) program to raise even more money across\nthe campus.\nPlan India was set up in 1996 as a\nprogram-driven, independent, child-centred Indian organisation. Its main\nobjective is to ensure the basic rights\nof children living in difficult circumstances through various programs, and\nto enable all children to realize their\nfull potential. Plan India believe that\nthrough working together, everyone involved in the development process can\ncontribute to building a better world.\nThis includes involving children and\nproviding them with opportunities to\nhave their say on issues affecting their\nlives, as well as education, workshops\nand medical attention.\nSave the Children are leaders in\ntransforming attitudes toward chil-dren. They aspire to producing breakthroughs for children through their\npolicies, focussed on campaigning,\nprogrammatic and emergency response work. They work to eradicate\nchild exploitation, neglect and suffer-ing, demanding justice for the world\u2019s\npoorest and most vulnerable children.\nThey aim to achieve dramatic change\nfor children through their work.\nMichael Sobell House, situated in\nNorthwood, Middlesex, opened in\n1977, focussing on improving quality\nof life for patients by providing relief\nfrom pain and distressing symptoms\nand illnesses such as cancer. Patients\nmay be admitted to the 16 bed in-pa-tient unit to help with symptom man-agement, rehabilitation, respite care,\nor care in the last few days of their life.\nThe Friends of Michael Sobell House\nsupport the House in providing a centre of excellence for specialist palliative\ncare services enhancing the care of patients with life limiting illness and support for their families and carers.\nThe three Vice-Presidents who run\nthe Indian Society, Parvandeep Kaur,\nShifa Perran and Khushboo Sinha wish\nto thank the whole committee, the per-formers, backstage crew, DramSoc, the\nLondon Palladium, the Union, PhotoSoc, Will Turner and all the other\nsocieties involved in the show.

Groundshaker Bhangra is\nrenowned for its passion, enthusiasm\nand spirit, which were definitely reflected in the performance. It was full\nof energy, enthusiasm and bounce,\nwhich left me breathless just from\nwatching!\nThe next act was a performance by\nNirag Chag, an up and coming produc-er. He was awarded \u201cBest Underground\nAct\u201d at the Asian Music Awards in November 2006. He is a performer, artist\nand composer, having been spotted\nwhilst working for the Outcaste label.\nHe mixes modern production with\nwestern and eastern classical styles,\nthus very much in keeping with the\nspirit of the evening. He has also written songs and soundtracks for both TV\nlar acrobatics and gymnastics. The\ndisplay left me breathless as the blades\nglittered just inches from the perform-ers, all perfectly set to music. The\nperformers were obviously incredibly\ntalented!\nEastside Story was the story of growing up with Eastern roots, whilst living with Western influences and the\nproblems with finding one\u2019s place.\nThe dancers were split into two, half\nwith modern clothes and dance styles,\nand half traditional. Each danced as if\nshowing off to the other, whilst a girl\nfrom the traditional dancers fell for a\nmodern boy. It ended explosively, in a\nRomeo-and-Juliet tragedy with the boy\nbeing shot and the girl appealing to her\ndaddy. It was well-choreographed and\nportrayed the narrative well.\nAccoustic Awaazein...

The dances were modernised by\nthe inclusion of dance music, an exciting and exhilarating update of a religious festival of music and dance.\nAfter a short break for the interval,\nAct Two was started by Glorious Gospel, performed by the Gospel Choir.\nThis is a recently-started venture at\nIC, and they performed a piece called\nGlorious, which was originally sung\nby Martha Munizzi, the famous gospel\nsinger. The Gospel Choir arranged the\nsong with a Latin American salsa twist,\nand it sounded, well, glorious!\nNext up was an act called A Woman\u2019s\nWorth which told the story of women\nempowered to battle their inner emotions and rise up.

    "content": "film.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n27\nFriday 15 February 2008 felix\nFilm\nMemories of Tomorrow, today\nValerio Chang\nWhat would you do if your mind was slowly decaying? One day, it\u2019s simply a business lunch you forgot to go\nto. The next day, it\u2019s the people you\u2019ve known for years. Memories of Tomorrow will break your heart\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, is everything alright?\u201d\nWho thought those words can be the\nmost heartbreaking line of a movie?\nAnd what kind of plot would make\nsuch a friendly concern the trigger for\na flood of tears and emotions from\nthe audience? Allow me to introduce\nMemories of Tomorrow.\nMost people will not have heard of\nMemories of Tomorrow, despite it being released two years ago. Filmed in\nJapanese and lacking in western dis-tributors, sadly saw people\u2019s ability to\ndiscover this gem of the portrayal of\nhuman emotions hampered.\nThe movie follows the reaction of\na middle-aged couple to the onset\nof Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Medics who\naware of the disease would know that\nthis movie will not have a happy ending as Alzheimer\u2019s cannot be cured,\nonly delayed, and it drastically affects\none\u2019s memory and ability to lead a normal life.\nThe protagonist, played by Ken Watanabe (The Last Samurai), is a successful director of a major advertising\nagency, who notices early on that he is\nforgetting business meetings. However\nit is only his wife who wonders why he\nbuys the same mouthwash each day for\na week.\nHis reaction to the doctor\u2019s diagnosis\nis a poignant reminder of how sensitive\nit is for practising doctors to tell terminal patients about their conditions.\nAs conditions worsen, we see the forgetfulness and self-pity consume the\ncharacter.\nExternal pressure mounts from his\nemployer to retire due to the condi-tion, while the internal struggle of being the provider of the family and his\nheadstrong machismo which prevents\nhim relying on others, take their toll.\nThe movie progresses as he is forced\nto retire and stay at home while his\nwife goes to work in a pottery gallery,\nleaving the tone of the film altered to\nbecome one that celebrates the love\nthat caring partners sacrifice for their\nloved ones, loved in the past tense now\nthat they don\u2019t behave as they used to.\nThe detailed notes that she leaves him\neveryday before she goes to work, the\npretence of happiness, the commitment to taking care of a husband who\nno longer remembers to drink water,\nthe tears dropped in solitude and the\nrefusal to let a care home take him all\ngo to show the strength of either her\nlove for him, or perhaps the social expectation of this behaviour. Either way,\nthe unconditional commitment moves\nthe heart and pokes those tear glands.\nThe twist in the otherwise rather\npredictable story takes the guy alone to\na forest as his wife tries to search for\nhim frantically. As day dawns, his wife\nfinds him and walks up to him, looking\nrelieved. The man walks towards her,\nand after a night without her presence\nmakes the heart wrenching statement\nquoted. The scenery in the latter part\nof the movie features green landscapes\nNo hidden costs\npromotional code IMP/0208\nAt UNITE, we wrap up all your bills and Internet\naccess* within the price of your rent.

Images and photography are indicative of accommodation only.\nwww.unite-students.com/london\nMuji decided to diversify its catalogue by introducing shades of red to complement its stone/beige pallet\nand views of nature that sharply contrast with the former part of the busy\ncity centres. The joy of rediscovering\nsmall rivers, snow, and the time to\nspend with children and grandchildren\ngreatly emphasise the sacrifices a man\nhas made to live the urban Japanese\nsalary-driven life.\nThe helplessness of facing the inevi-table, the resignation, the appreciation\nof the simplest things, the realisation\nof hurting someone you love, the understanding of being betrayed. This is\ndefinitely a noteworthy film for those\nnights that you want to let out some\nemotions, or are wanting to feel how\nprecious it is to simply be able to know\nand be who you are.\n\n"

Without an official home pitch\nfor IC, and only one training session\nso far, the team made the journey up\nthe M40 fully confident in our abilities\nand looking forward to what would be\na hard hitting encounter.\nDespite the strong breeze which kept\nscoring low throughout the game, the\npitch was in good shape and allowed for\nplenty of open play. Oxford started the\ngame brightly, if very arrogantly, trying\ntheir luck with at least four pot shots\nat goal from close range, all expertly\nkept out by keeper Mus Botchway and\naided by some frenetic defending by\nthe full and half back lines marshalled\nby Eddie O\u2019Hare. Inspired by our defence and long kick-outs into the wind,\nthe IC team began to take the game to\nOxford. Midfield duo, Finian McCann\nand Gaelic football debutant Danny\nWilson were outstanding in midfield,\ncompeting for possession and feeding\nthe Forwards with some quality ball,\ndespite the rough and high tackles\ncoming in from all sides by the dirty\nOxford old boys frustrated at the lack\nof time afforded them on the ball \u2013 or\nmaybe just the dig to the mouth Finain\ngave to his marker. Half time came and\nIC left the field only four points down,\nby no means an insurmountable task.\nAfter passionate words from Club\nCaptain Frank O\u2019Neill, we retook the\nfield with every intention of grabbing\nthe next score. Several attempts and\nsome scoreable free-kicks later, hampered by the breeze, IC were unlucky\nnot to be on even terms. Oxford made\nfull use of the wind and pressed their\nadvantage by moving their target man\ndirectly in front of the goals to get the\nbetter of full-back Andrew Lavery by\nGaelic Football comes to IC\nGaelic Football\nFriendly\nImperial College 0-0 (0)\nOxford University 3-04 (13)\nAndrew Lavery\ncontinually sending high balls in over\nthe top. Despite several saves and solid\ndefending IC made some silly mistakes and conceded some soft goals,\nthe score line not reflecting the match\nbeing played at all. The second half\nplayed out with some neat play from\nforwards Doyle, Phelan and Carville\nalways threatening to score but IC\neventually came off the field, defeated\nbut still proud of a very respectable\nperformance.\nSpecial mention must be made to\nskilful performance of \u2018Man of the\nMatch\u2019, Pat McMullen playing like a\nnatural despite only learning the rules\nof Gaelic watching a match down at the\nUnion on Saturday night and reading\nWikipedia the next morning.

    "content": "5\nFriday 15 February 2008 felix\nI\nwander around to the rear of the CoS bulding. It\u2019s deserted, but on my\nway up the alley staircase that runs between the church and the CoS,\nI\u2019m noticed by two large men in dark blue suits and coats. The building is large, and I\u2019m trying to work out how many rooms it must have,\nand looking at the windows, most of which are coated on the inside\nwith an opaque material, even on the top floors. One of the two men has\nfollowed me round, and slowly approaches me as I stand at the mouth of an\nopen (wide enough to fit a truck) dead-end that houses the rear entrance to\nthe CoS behind a row of tidy bins. He asks me what I\u2019m doing.\n\u201cI\u2019m looking at the building,\u201d I reply, \u201cI\u2019m covering the protest for student\npress.\u201d\n\u201cWhere\u2019s your I.D?\u201d he asks.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t issue student press I.D, all I have is my college I.D.\u201d\n\u201cCan I see it?\u201d he says, staring at me in a none-too friendly manner. At\nthis point I lie and tell him that I don\u2019t carry it with me if I\u2019m not going to\ncollege. It\u2019s in my wallet, but I\u2019m worried. The protestors at the front have\nmasks because they\u2019re frightened of the Church of Scientology\u2019s reputation\nin the U.S., and over here to some extent. Accusations abound that they hire\ndetectives to investigate people that protest their events. That they follow\npeople home, photograph them to identify and intimidate them, picket them,\nharass them, stalk them and file frivolous litigation to silence dissent and in-vestigation. I\u2019ve seen the John Sweeney investigation, some XenuTV footage,\nand enough documentation to worry me, but today I have come without a\nmask. Journalists don\u2019t wear masks. My intention is to cover this event in an\nunbiased manner because it\u2019s newsworthy. I\u2019m not attacking them, so why\nshould I hide? I have nothing to hide. There is a woman in front of the building filming the protestors and taking their pictures. My picture has already\nbeen taken. Still I refuse to show my I.D. I stand my ground, holding onto my\nnotebook and pen, and ask this man if he\u2019s a member of the CoS.\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m not a member,\u201d he replies.\n\u201cAre you part of the security team?\u201d I ask.\n\u201cI\u2019m not security.\u201d\nSo I ask him why he wants to see my I.D.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been monitoring you,\u201d he says. At this point in the conversation, my\nadrenaline kicks in. This is a dialogue that is both sinister and sounds like a\nbad novel.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve been monitoring me? Why?\u201d I ask. He does not answer. I press\nfurther: \u201cWho asks random people in the street for their I.D?\u201d\nHe shrugs. \u201cI do,\u201d he says with a smile.\nA\nwoman in her late fifties passes us and breaks some of the\ntension. She walks down to the back door and tries the\nhandle. Finding it locked, she starts looking into the win-dows. The man who is not security walks towards her. \u201cI\u2019m\na parishioner,\u201d she calls to him in an American accent. I\nsuspect that he nods at her, but I can\u2019t be sure. I spot my editor rounding\nthe corner about 20 metres away. Someone opens the door from the inside and lets the woman into the building, and the security guard is back\nby my side. Tom reaches us just as we resume our conversation.\n\u201cAre you sure you\u2019re not security? That woman seemed to think you\nwere.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not security,\u201d he repeats. I ask him for his I.D. but he refuses. He\nevades my questions for a while, during which I ask him a few more times\nwhether he\u2019s a member of security, or in any way affiliated with the CoS.\nHe denies everything, remains silent, says \u2018No Comment\u2019, or changes the\nsubject.\nI ask why he is here, monitoring me.\n\u201cWe\u2019re here for peace,\u201d he says.\nI introduce him to the Felix editor, and ask Tom to verify that we don\u2019t\nissue press identification. He does, but the man who is not security does\nnot seem impressed. I apologise if we\u2019ve caused him offence, but that I\nunderstand if he has a job to guard the building that he has to be watch-ful, but that we\u2019re on a public right of way. He doubts whether we have a\nright to be there. I take a few steps towards the alley that leads to the back\ndoor. He stands beside me, and tells me that the alley is not public prop-erty. He slowly takes a few steps towards me, standing to his full height\n(a few inches more than mine and about twice as wide), and stares at me.\nIntimidation is clearly his intent. I meet his gaze for a number of seconds.\nAgain, the tension is broken by the approach of a neatly-presented man\nin a black suit, white shirt, and red tie. He rounds the corner and approaches us. At the same time, a few people exit the rear door. The man\nwho is not security walks towards them and begins talking to another\nlarge man in a dark blue suit and coat.\n\u201cCan I help you?\u201d asks the man in the red tie. I explain that I\u2019m covering the protest for student press and ask if he\u2019s a member of the church.\nHe nods. I say that I\u2019d like to talk to a member of the CoS about their\nthoughts on the protests, both here and around the world. He gives me\na phone number and tells me to call back later in the week. I ask for his\nname so that I can tell the person that answers the phone who gave me\nthe number. \u201cMark,\u201d he replies, \u201cJust ask for Mark.\u201d I later find out that\nMark is the head of Scientology PR in the UK. Before he goes to meet the\npeople who have exited the building I pose a last question:\n\u201cIs that man a member of your security team?\u201d I quickly ask, indicating\nthe man who is not security.\nMark looks confused, but replies: \u201cYes.\u201d\nTom and I walk back around to the front of the building, the chanting\nand chatter breaking the quiet of the back alley. A few minutes later, as we\nstand next to the police, the man who is not security walks swiftly around\nto the front of the CoS. He extracts an I.D. card from his pocket, shows\nit to the guarding police officer, then walks through the door and stands\nthere, hands behind his back, behind a layer of plexiglass as a woman\npoints a camera at the nearest protesters, recording their every action.\n\n"

    "content": "12 felix Friday 15 February 2008\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nComment\nThe PPS, A. Geek, Imperial, and myself\nW\nhen I came to Imperial for an inter-view, I remember\ngetting off at South\nKen and ambling\ndown the subway, passing museums\nand whatnot. There was a jazz flautist\nbusking, my interview was a few hours\naway and the morning air was crisp. I\ninstantly fell in love with the place and\nwith London, and I knew that this is\nwhere I was going to be if I did not get\ninto Oxford.\nWhen Medicine Year 1 finally start-ed, I had just finished two gap years of\ntravel, business, and jobs where I had\ndone much and caught up fully with\nmy other life-enriching hobbies such\nas books, politics, guitar, drums, art,\netc. But coming from an erratic, almost lonely education in a state school\nwhere no-one understood me, coupled\nwith the detached gap years, I arrived\nat university expecting something\nlarger than life itself. I made it a goal\nto utilise every opportunity and pursue\nall my interests with a will to progress\non all fronts from journalism to clubs/\nsocieties, from photography to sport,\nand from culture to current affairs! I\nwas ready to take London on.\nYet, a bit into my first year, and although I started to achieve many\nthings, I could not help but feel a little\ndisappointed. Firstly, being an Asian, I\nhad never encountered the rude-boy\nculture either back home or anywhere\nelse, so instantly felt sidelined from\nvast swathes of people of my own race\nand culture at Imperial. I really had\nnothing to say to them or anything\nin common with them to talk about.\nSecondly, I felt completely alienated\nfrom another majority on my course,\nthe public school boys, for whom I felt\nthe concept of friendship meant something different to mine.\nMoreover, medicine itself was a real\nbore in the initial years, grinding me\ndown with pointless lectures and facts\nthat needed to be swallowed and regurgitated solely to pass exams. The icing\non this bitter cake was the unnecessarily competitive nature of fellow medics\nwhich I found unbearably annoying.\nAll of these feelings slowly turned\ninto contempt for Imperial and the\npeople around me. However, it was not\nall doom and gloom as in good time I\nalso found some people who were very\nmuch like me. People who did not\ncare about what others thought about\nthem and had enough self respect and\nguts to see beyond the obvious and say\nor do what they felt was right. These\nhave become my amazing friends and\nones that I enjoy making compromises\nfor, but still I could not shake the dislike that I had for the majority and the\ninstitution.\nYou should know that this was not all\nin bitter response to an Oxford rejection as I actually had managed to get\nin to study PPE there and rejected it to\npursue medicine, and I now also much\npreferred the less scientific medical\ncourse at IC. So why this disdain for\nImperial? I did not know. I just knew\nthat it existed.\nThings slowly changed, though, in\nthird year. I met a person or two that\ngot me thinking with my heart and I\nalso got to enjoy my first year as the\nleader of an organisation, The Pakistan\nSociety, going on to win the President\u2019s\nAward from the Union. Furthermore,\nmedicine finally became clinical and\na golden opportunity presented itself\nfor me to follow that year with a trip to\nKenya to practice medicine there, cementing my love for medicine proper.\nBut none of these were responsible\nfor changing my attitude towards Imperial. It was, in fact, the gradual realisation that no matter where you go\nand what you do, ultimately it does not\nmatter.\nThis is a bit weighty, be warned, but\nafter much thought I felt that if life\nis to eventually come to an end, then\nwhat does anything matter? Existence\nseemed suddenly very short and all\nthings temporary, and I pinpointed my\ndislike for my situation stemming from\nan inability to accept the temporary\nnature of life as you and I know it.\nI realised then that no matter where\nI went or what I did, I would not find\npeace and happiness, unless I can\nlearn to be thankful for whatever God\nhas given me. And then when I took a\ngood look at myself, I had so much to\nbe thankful for.\nSo I think I was not actually unhappy\nwith Imperial but with life itself, and I\ncame to realise that if I was looking for\npermanence, I would find it nowhere\nbut with God, the one who is infinitely\nwise, most merciful, and above everything else the one who we come from\nand everything comes from and the\none to whom we must return. This realisation happened in early June and I\ndon\u2019t care how cheesy that sounds!\nSo, after such heavy-duty philoso-phy, I come to the crunch of this arti-cle. Over time, I have realised that I am\nvery happy to be at Imperial and very\ngrateful for all the opportunities I have\nbeen able to pursue here. I have realised that actually there are a lot of like-minded people here but we are just not\nthe majority, being dispersed across\nvarious concentrations and years. And\nI have realised that no other university\nwould have provided the same feeling\nof belonging as Imperial or such an excellent city to live in.\nNevertheless, I have recently made\nsome mistakes in the way I have handled my privileged responsibilities here\nand I have learnt a lot from them, and\nnow I want to make some statements\nregarding them.\nBeing the chair of the Political Philosophy Society as one of the most buzzing societies on campus is a real honour and I have the following to say. Mr.\nSamuel Black, the reason I felt that the\nJerusalem Post was trying to malign us,\nour university, and our speakers is because it reported inaccurate facts. Over\na day before it went to print, we had\nchanged the speakers and Prof. Newman had never pulled out. They used\nan old private email that Prof. Newman sent to us to go to print, without\nconsulting the Prof. or ourselves first\nand he was as angry as we were. Furthermore, they did not want to print a\nfollow-up with the correct facts as they\nwere happy to try and portray us as\nhaving invited Tamimi just because of\nhis views. In hindsight, the right thing\nto have done would have been to say\ngoodbye to Newman since he was the\none not willing to share the platform;\nbut we acted to save the event. Maybe\nwe did so at the expense of principle.,\nbut in any case the PPS sincerely apolo-gises to Mr. Tamimi.\nAlso, regarding our study on Kashmir\non Thursday, I would like to apologise\nto those who attended expecting the\nsame quality discussion as the Israel/\nPalestine and Somalia/Ethiopia events.\nI thought that inviting a Kashmiri\nspeaker to address both sides would\nsuffice, but did not expect that it would\nbe a one-sided rally-like address. It is\nnot the speaker\u2019s fault but ours as we\ndid not do sufficient research when inviting him. Trust me, a lot of important\nlessons have been learnt here!\nNext, I want to thank the good folks\nat Felix for their help with managing the\nfurore and inadvertently giving the PPS\nsome excellent publicity through their\nbalanced reporting. And I also want to\nthank Union President Stephen Brown\nfor understanding our situation, the\nmistakes we made as a newbie soc, and\nsupporting us (also sorry that the one\nPPS event you came to sample was not\nof the same quality as the rest).\nFinally, a warm thanks to Mr. A. Geek\nfor his kind words. I am really glad\nthat you enjoyed my work so much,\nsir! Reading your comment piece last\nweek was quite an experience! When I\ncame to the Felix office to lay that issue\nout, I remember reading it and thinking that it was utter trash, similarly to\nyou, but your compliments have given\nme renewed initiative as I continue to\ntackle other themes in my two-month\ntrip. When you put a lot of hard work\ninto your writing and find it buried at\nthe back of the issue, it can be a bit disheartening to think that people may\nnot even get to it.\nAnyway, please find an article on the\nCongo in the travel section soon and\nfor anyone looking for the piece Mr.\nGeek refers to, I have put it up on my\nFacebook profile with a corresponding\nphoto album.\nAmmar Waraich\n\u201c\nmedicine\nitself was a real\nbore in the initial\nyears, grinding\nme down\nwith pointless\nlectures and\nfacts\n\u201d\n\u201c\nOver time,\nI have realised\nthat I am very\nhappy to be at\nImperial and very\ngrateful for all\nthe opportunities\nI have Anyone else sick of pictures of Ammar yet? No? Oh ok, here\u2019s another\nThe speakers at Political Philosophy Society\u2019s controversial Israel/Palestine Conflict Case Study last week\n\n"

    "content": "42 felix Friday 15 February 2008\nEast Meets West: Mesmerizing\nE\nast Meets West is an annual\ncharity show, organised and\nperformed by the Indian Society. It is the largest show\nat Imperial and celebrates\nthe vibrant diversity of both Imperial\nCollege and London. The theme of the\nevening is to raise money by enjoying a\nshow highlighting a fusion of Eastern\nand Western cultures, by music, dance\nand performance. This year\u2019s performance was billed as \u201ca passionate embrace of culture\u201d, the seamless fusion\nof fierce hip-hop, Hindi and orient tra-ditions. All profits from the show are\ndonated to charities and similar worthwhile causes.\nEast Meets West started 16 years\nago as a simple idea to demonstrate\nclassical Eastern acts alongside more\ncontemporary Western performances.\nFrom performances in the Great Hall\nin front of 400 people, it has grown\ninto a very diverse production. Previous venues have included the Shaftesbury Theatre, Hammersmith Carling\nApollo, Barbican Hall and the Shepherd\u2019s Bush Empire. To accommodate\nthe show\u2019s immense growth, it has\nmoved in the past years to the prestigious London Palladium, which has a\ncapacity of 2200.\nOn Sunday 10th February, East\nMeets West 2008 took place. The theatre buzzed with the excitement of over\n1800 friends and families of the performers and students of IC. The lights\nwere gradually dimmed and a countdown appeared, projected onto the\nstage. It got larger and larger, vibrating\nwith the beat of the music, until everyone counted down to the start of the\nshow. As I was sitting there I was so\nIndian Society\u2019s East Meets West 2008 was a spectacular blaze of sultry sounds, dazzling dress, fiery beats\nand a mosaic of colour. Sally Longstaff attended and reports on this passionate embrace of world cultures\nexcited: a brilliant, inspired start!\nThe show started with Lacrimosa,\nan unexpected, emotional, powerful\nand intense fusion of modern and traditional dance, including break danc-ing. After this, the comedy duo hosts\nbounded onstage, exuding energy.\nThey were Eddie Nestor, who featured\nin Trainspotting, and Robbie Gee from\nSnatch and Pirates of the Caribbean.\nReminisce and Remember was the\nnext act, a musical journey through\nsong encompassing the \u201clyrical melodies of Western musical/operatic styles\nwith the ethereal sounds of days bygone in the Byzantine East\u201d. The two\nsingers were spectacular, and the whole\nact displayed a high level of talent. The\nsongs and voices were both haunting\nand melodic.\nA real highlight for me was the Elements of Fashion act, a very well-staged\nfashion extravaganza. Air, Earth, Water\nand Fire, the elements of fashion, were\ndisplayed in an explosive fusion of\nWestern and Eastern dress. The work\non display was from such prestigious\ninstitutions as the London College of\nFashion. The hair and make-up was\nspectacular, complementing the outfits\ncompletely. The models were amazing\nand moved like true professionals.\nNext was a medley of songs from\nDestiny\u2019s Child, performed by four\ngirls with incredible voices: Ishan\nMehta, Shifa Peeran, Ramyah Rajakulasingam and Khushboo Sinha. They\nwere followed by The Freestylin\u2019 Bols\nof Bollywood, an eclectic mix of table\nbols (beats) and Kathak with some Bollywood craziness set to modern dance\nand pop tracks, such as Amy Winehouse\u2019s Valerie. Kathak is a classical\ndance form from North India, and it\nis a narrative dance characterized by\nfast footwork and spins. Ghunghru or\nsmall bells were tied around the dancers\u2019 ankles, tinkling and ringing as they\nmoved.\nMy personal favourite of the night\nwas The Good, the Bad and Funkology, an epic adventure to the days of\nbandits and lawless gun-fighting on\nthe untamed frontier of the Wild, Wild\nWest. A truly impressive routine of\nacting and dance in which the choreography was fast-paced, intricate and\nfunny!! I loved it, especially the shootout scene! It was performed by the\nFunkology Team and members of the\nUrban Dance Company.\nBollywood Blossom was next, with\nfour singers performing a light-heart-ed, delightful song from the popular\nHindi movie, Parineeta. The sweet-sounding melodies of the four voices in\nHindi soared into the theatre, beautifully captivating in their elegance and.\neven though I didn\u2019t understand the\nwords, the sentiment was translated\nperfectly.\nDefinitely a great hit with the audience was the Jewels of Arabia, from the\nBelly Dancing Club. The girls shim-mied, shook and swirled their way\naround stage, memorising the male audience and making the girls jealous of\ntheir flat stomachs and gyrating hips!!\nFusion Fever! was a unique all-girl fusion of pop and bharatnatyam dancing,\nwhich was fun, feisty and full of energy.\nBharatnatyam is a classical dance form\noriginating from Tamil Nadu, a state in\nSouthern India. It is traditionally performed by women and the hand shapes\nare meaningful gestures, with each\nmeaning something different. Some\nof these can be seen in the photos of\nthe event, performed by the dancers\nin blue. The combination of modern\nand traditional dance and costumes\nwas really breathtaking, and the contrasting pink and blue costumes were\nspectacular.\n\u201cseamless fusion\nof fierce hip-hop,\nHindi and orient\ntraditions\u201d\nC/w from top left: Elements of Fashion, Freestylin\u2019 Bols of Bollywood, The Good, the Bad & Funkology, Groundshaker Bhangra, Madhuri ki Masti, Elements of Fashion, Eastside Story\n\n"

Front man James \u2013 who, inciden-tally, hasn\u2019t even bothered to remove\nhis coat and hat \u2013 was clearly not lying\nwhen he told us he doesn\u2019t get nervous\n\u2013 and it shows! and it shows!\nDrums blast away (accompanied by\nsome impressive keyboards) opening\ntheir best-known single 'So Hard', instantly recognised by a few keen fans. It\nisn't long before the freshly-galvanised\ngathering finally breaks into a sweat.\nThe technical crew's incompetence\nunfortunately means the vocals are almost inaudible for the first few tracks,\nbut nobody seems overly phased. Indeed, the first impression we get is how\nmuch better these guys sound live than\non their studio-produced album.\nEach of the band members has his\nchance to shine. The bassist is strong\nand consistent and good fun to watch\n\u2013 constantly moving to the rhythm of\nhis sound. The keyboardist is steady,\nconcentrated and absorbed in his play-ing, which can be said to almost form\nArt Brut actually makes sense. The\ndefinition of \u201cArt Brut\u201d is, according to a very reliable Internet source,\n\u201cRaw art, \u2018raw\u2019 in that it has not been\nthrough the \u2018cooking\u2019 process: the art\nworld of art schools, galleries, muse-ums. Originally art by psychotic individuals who existed almost completely\noutside culture and society.\u201d This seems\na fitting description for a band that indubitably deserve the indie descriptor,\nwhose lyrics and demeanour embody a\nband that will inevitably never achieve\nmainstream success.\nOf course, this is what indie is all\nabout: being unpopular with the main-stream, going against convention.\nThere is, of course, nothing wrong\nwith this, but I had yet to hear an indie-branded band that I actually liked. The\nlyrics were nonsensical, the guitars\nwere practically insane and unstruc-tured, and everything had to move at\nan incomprehensibly fast pace for no\njustifiable reason.\nThe most I had heard from Art Brut\nprior to the gig was at places like Koko,\nwherein the opening riffs to \u201cBad\nWeekend\u201d was enough to send the indie boys and girls into a euphoric orbit.\nPerhaps it wasn\u2019t the best place to discover an indie band that went against\nthe indie convention, as at the time I\ndidn\u2019t really understand why the line\n\u201cPopular Culture no longer applies to\nme\u201d was so absolutely essential to a\nnight out in London.\nSo zip forwards to a cold night at\nULU, with me was queuing up to\nsee the band in person. Who\u2019d have\nthought it possible that a Muse fan\nwould want to see something that\nmany people would designate as indie?\nI may have been one of three people\nthere that knew barely any of the lyrics,\nbut to be honest, I don\u2019t think it really\nmattered. What I presumed to be a gig\nrapidly transformed into an excitable\nband and a jumpy frontman regaling\nus with tales of how he embarrassed\nhimself time and time again, and how\nhe made up for it in later life, all set to\na thundering, memorable instrumental\nbackdrop.\nI was in shock. Where were the silly\nfast-paced guitars? What about the ridiculous lyrics? Why couldn\u2019t I see the\nfrontman blaring complete and utter\nrubbish into his microphone? Well, it\nturns out that Art Brut are not what I\nthought they might be.\nEddie Argos, the frontman, was positively magnanimous. He was hyperactive and overexcited, and he doesn\u2019t so\nmuch sing as he reads aloud. His lyrics\nare honest, precise, and simply genius.\nThey tell simple stories of past relationships in such a down-to-Earth, realistic and believable way that everyone\non this tiny little planet can relate to\nthem. There are no unnecessary soaring vocals nor are there any slippery,\nsaccharine-sweet ballads \u2013 Art Brut\nare all about the here and now, and it\nmakes so much sense it\u2019s ridiculous.\nThere is something quite endearing about everything he says. Past\nchildhood sweethearts are dedicated\nto and immortalised in songs such as\n\u201cEmily Kane\u201d, (I hope this song finds\nyou fame/I want school kids on buses\nsinging your name). Traditional Rock\nand Roll is thrown to the side in \u201cBang\nBang Rock and Roll\u201d, (No more songs\nabout sex, drugs, and rock and roll/It\u2019s\nboring!), and contemporary artwork\nis given an enthusiastic thumbs-up in\n\u201cModern Art\u201d, (Modern Art makes me\nwant to rock out!).\nInterlaced throughout all the songs\nare random inserts from other bands,\nall of which are given a pleasing belit-tling. This is indie and how it should\nbe done \u2013 whereas Alternative Rock\nwas left alone (indeed, We Are Scientists are known to be big fans of Art\nBrut), power pop and pop in general\nwas destroyed by Art Brut\u2019s undeniable\nenergy. Finally, a band that is willing to\nremind the world that a song informing the listener how to spell \u201cBananas\u201d\nover and over again is not a song \u2013 it\u2019s\nrubbish.\nHalfway through songs, Mr. Argos\nbegan to skip using the microphone\nleads, watched as his two guitarists\nknighted each other, and changed some\nof the lyrics to include what he got up\nto last night after too much alcohol.\nAll the while, his four band members\nuplifted even the most nostalgic, melancholy lyric into the stratosphere of\nand sax-a-ma-phones could be heard,\nand it added more to an already pleas-ingly-overloaded gig.\nWe were all reminded \u2013 or educated\n\u2013 on their performance overseas, with\nthe song \u201cGood Weekend\u201d achieving\nchart-topping success in practically\nevery country that didn\u2019t have Top of\nthe Pops. Still, that didn\u2019t stop them\nor the crowd chanting \u201cArt Brut \u2013 Top\nof the Pops!\u201d which was soon replaced\nwith a similar dedication to their Big\nBand backing group.\nBy the time they had left the stage I\neuphoria. No matter how sad the songs\ncould be, Art Brut\u2019s rising, ecstatic nature meant they were, and always will\nbe, about having fun remembering the\npast and looking to the future. A band\nyou could relate to in both imagination\nand reality is a rare thing.\nLet us not forget that on this particular night, the five indie rockers had assembled a Brass Section \u2013 the Big Band\n\u2013 who provided a noticeable, welcome\nlayer to the gig. Somehow, above the\nabsorbing lyrics and the searing-hot\nguitar play, the trumpets, trombones\nLevy let loose at the Islington Bar Academy\nArt Brut art-rocking out at ULU\nFor a five-piece group from New York\nthat had only just replenished several\nband members to return so promptly\nwith such a solid album, \u201cGlorious\u201d, is\nquite a feat. The undersold gathering\nat the Islington Bar Academy, London\nmay feel a bit like make-or-break time\nfor a band that has consistently garnered more acclaim here for their alternative rock style and borderline depressing lyrics than in their homeland.\nLevy are the third of three acts to\nplay, but apparently the previous two\nhave done little to thaw the January\nchill from the frigid crowd, which is\nstaring, completely expressionless, at\nthe empty stage. Lights go dark, and\nmay have been almost completely deaf\n(that will teach me to stand inches away\nfrom the speakers) but their lyrics were\nechoing through my mind long after\nthe trombones had fallen silent and\nwere replaced with the murmurs of the\nsatisfied and the inebriated.\nAnd so you have it: an indie band that\nactually makes sense. They will always\nremain outsider artists, and as such, to\nthe initiated, will always remain a hidden joy in the deep, dark ocean of the\nmusic industry.\nRobin Andrews\nLive Review\nLive Review\nthe backbone of most tracks. Oddly\nenough, James is probably the least\nexpressive, compared to his mates.\nThe only hint to his emotion is his facial expressions \u2013 but what he delivers sounds great. Finally, both guitar\nand drums amaze \u2013 giving life to each\nsong. It's unfortunate that they're less\nnoticeable on the CD, because they\nsound incredible \u2013 every note they\nplay appears to echo off their body.\nThe award for most electrifying goes\nto the guitarist, though, and during his\nextended solo on the closing track, 'On\nthe Dancefloor', he goes insane, ending\nthe evening on a definite high.\nOnce the last song finishes, there is\nmuch well-deserved cheering, but no\n'encore', which is a shame. The band\ngraciously bows and leaves.\nIt is no wonder that their fans are\nmainly those who have seen them play\nlive. The show makes a pleasant change\nfrom the admittedly less interesting\nstudio music. If you enjoy their mate-rial, do not miss out on an opportunity\nto see them live!\nChris Birkett & Kate Agathos\nArt Brut doing their thing, rock and roll all the way!\nLevy strutting their stuff\nArt Brut\nULU\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2729\nLevy\nIslington Bar Academy\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2729\n\n"

    "content": "45\nfelix\nFriday 15 February 2008\nsport.felix@imperial.ac.uk Sport\nInjury can be a painful experience for\nanyone, both physically and emotion-ally, but for a competitive athlete it can\nopen up a whole other can of worms.\nThis is because you are a competitor\nnot only against others but with yourself and to suddenly be stopped in your\ntracks is very unnerving, it can disrupt\nyour season in terms of being ready to\ncompete, and you may even have to\nmiss out on some competitions. This is\nall very difficult to digest and on top of\nthis you hurt, some times a little, some\ntimes a lot. This doesn\u2019t always stop\nyou from participating, but the majority of the time by doing this you end\nup putting yourself at greater risk of a\nmore serious injury or perhaps even\nworse- in team sports you could put\nothers\u2019 safety at risk.\nAs boring as it may sound, an injured athlete needs to act responsibly.\nThis is difficult when you have a mixture of emotions battling against each\nother but can be made easier by writing down how you feel or chatting to\na friend. Bruised self esteem, anger,\ndenial, helplessness, disbelief, uncer-tainty, and sadness are just some of the\nfeelings an injured athlete will encounter on the road to recovery so having\nan outlet can be really beneficial during this time.\nFrom the following extracts taken\nfrom the diary of one of my injured\nclients - a competitive runner - you\ncan gain an insight into the obstacles\nshe has had to overcome, and is still\ndealing with. I hope this will act as a\nway for other injured persons to realise\nthat they are not alone, help is at hand,\nbut also that you will make progress\nand can take some positives from the\nexperience.\nExtracts from an injured athlete\u2019s\ndiary:\nAny serious athlete has goals. Usually the goal is to improve their body\nthrough lifestyle changes to accomplish a task. These aims are present\nconstantly: the details of the training\nprogram, the purpose of each workout,\nreflecting on previous training to find\nways to improve, what type of food and\nhow much one consumes, when and\nhow much one sleeps, and researching\nways to become better. Sport is my an-chor: it gets me out of bed, it makes me\ntired so I can fall asleep, I eat healthy\nafter a hard workout, I love seeing my\nbody\u2019s limits. And when everything\nelse in life is falling apart (i.e. academ-ics, relationships, other activities),\nsport gets me through the day. When I\ninjured my foot three months ago, I realised how addicted and high I am after\na good and satisfying training session.\nIt\u2019s been three months - 12 weeks.\nTwo of them I couldn\u2019t walk, four of\nthem I was ill with flu/head colds,\nsix of them I couldn\u2019t go on any type\nof cardio machines. Nearly all twelve\nhave robbed me of the athlete high. Injury is a domino effect. If life is split up\ninto academics, work, athletics, non-athletic activities, eating, and sleeping:\nathletics affects it all. My studies have\nsuffered, my sleep is restless, eating is\nnot as enjoyable and often the sugary\ndelights are more tempting.\nEveryday I go to the gym to do\nmy \u201cexercises\u201d which is just a list of\nstretches (ie squats, lunges, foot exer-cises, abdominal crunches and other\ncore stability holds). I can see the improvements on a week-to-week basis\nand this positive attitude is what gets\nme to the gym to do the Physio\u2019s recommended routine. It is frustrating\nmost days; I often cannot complete a\ncertain exercise since I\u2019ll have pain or\ncramping which cripples me mentally.\nI log all my workouts- maybe it\u2019s a bit\nOCD, but I don\u2019t know anyone that\ndoesn\u2019t enjoy seeing progress or not\nseeing progress and addressing why.\nMy emotional state also suffers.\nOther than work, I had nothing to look\nforward to in the week- I couldn\u2019t go\non the long Sunday run or the certain\nworkout class. I don\u2019t have anything in\nthe diary at present that I\u2019m training\nfor, just to recover. This is motivation\nenough for me to continue because\nthree months later- I am walking and\nslowly reintroducing exercises into my\nnew training schedule.\nSo until I can run again, I\u2019ll keep up\nthe sport massages, physio, \u201cweightless\u201d training sessions and a training\nlog to track progress. I can\u2019t give up on\nmyself. This type of drive made me a\nsuccessful athlete so now I just need to\nkeep my mind on the goal to recover\nand gently fight through the tough\ntimes so that in the future I can attain\nthe runner\u2019s high again. Eventually I\u2019ll\nbe back to my old self- happy to have\na training goal rather than the present\none: maintaining baseline fitness and\nnurturing myself back to health.\nIf you are suffering from an injury\nwhich prevents you from taking part\nin your chosen activity, please do come\nand see us in Energia.\nCoping with injury\nHannah Barr\nEnergia Fitness Instructor\nThe curse of the Valentine\u2019s Day match\nImperial secure promotion!\nRugby\nBUSA\nImperial Men\u2019s 1st XV 69\nMiddlesex Men\u2019s 1st XV 5\nJovan Nedi\u0107\nSports Editor\nInjury can always be an emotional struggle for athletes\nIt must have been a rather daunting\nthought for bottom of the table Middlesex as they arrived at Fortress Harlington this Wednesday. Middlesex\nhad only won one game so far and were\ndefinitely getting relegated, Imperial on\nthe other hand were top, raring to improve their performance and gunning\nfor promotion into the Premiership.\nThe line-up for the match was a bold\nmove by the coaches, resting up to 9\nregular 1st XV starters. Although there\nwas a fear that the team may struggle\nas a consequence, the fear quickly disappeared within the first 5 minutes.\nImperial showed great strength, running some very attacking lines. The\nfirst points didn\u2019t come from a try\nhowever, but from a penalty kicked by\ncentre Dan Godfrey. This was just the\nbeginning of the tidal wave of scores\nthat Imperial were going to unleash on\nMiddlesex, and the newly formed batch\nof 1st XV players began to work like a\nfinely tuned, well oiled juggernaut.\nThe back three of Rob Phillipps,\nMax Joachim and Michael Okoigun\nopened up their legs and were flying\ndown the wing, making several darting runs. Imperials\u2019 opening try came\nfrom a scrum in Middlesex\u2019s 22, with\nscrum-half Remi Williams off loading\nthe ball to Rob Phillipps who simply\nsailed over the line in the corner. Dan\nGodfrey easily converted to get the extra two points.\nWith the forwards dominating in the\nscrum and giving very clean ball, the\nbacks were able to sparkle and simply\ndance around the Middlesex backs,\nwho were bemused by centre Joe Harris\u2019 run straight through them to get\nthe second try again in the corner. Dan\nGodfrey, not phased by the fact he was\nall the way out on the touchline, sailed\nthe ball over the posts to the dismay of\nAlexander Johnstone on the sideline.\nThe back three again showed their\nutter domination with winger Mike\nOkoigun breaking a couple tackles and\npowered his way over the try-line. This\ntime the kick was in the opposite corner to the previous two, yet this was no\nproblem for Godfrey as he just kept tallying up the points. Phillipps finished\noff an astounding first half scoring a\ntry from what can only be attributed to\nshear pace, leaving the half-time score\nat 29 - 0 to Imperial.\nThe half-time talk was very straight\nforward - more of the same. The Imperial pack were by far the superior\none, turning over scrums and rucks,\nleaving the fly-half James Fletcher with\nplenty of time to set up attacks and allowed Okougun to get his second try.\nKicking duties had now passed onto\nMan of the Match Joachim who con-verted. Support play was the key to the\nvictory with every player doing their\npart, even prop forward Joseph Sanders who was ready and waiting in support to Fletcher, thus scoring his first\ntry of the season.\nSome changes were made during\nthe half, yet even these changes didn\u2019t\ndiminish the performance of the side.\nReplacement winger James Aulford\nshowed great power and awareness\nas he broke through the line and off\nloaded the ball Sanders. Having made\na good 30 meters, the pack set up the\nball and then simple hands down the\nline allowed Joachim to score his first\ntry, which he converted. The flood\ngates were well and truly open now,\nand Imperial were ever vigilant to how\nthey were going to score their next try.\nThe backs were on fire, and only\nsupposed errors denied Phillips three\nmore tries. Yet this didn\u2019t stop him\ngetting his hat-trick of tries, nor did\nit stop Joachim getting his second try.\nThe excitement of tries and dazzling\nperformance was too much for fly-half\nJames Fletcher, who at one point decided to have a fight with the posts and\nlost, thus earning himself the Twat of\nthe Match title.\nBut it was the last try of the game\nthat summed up the entire day. The\nImperial forwards managed to turn\nover a Middlesex scrum inside the Imperial half, and with a quick re-adjust-ment and simple scissor, replacement\ncentre John Goulding waltzed through\nthe Middlesex defenders to score a 50\nmetre try.\nWith the game ending after that try,\nthe score stood at 69 - 5 to Imperial\n(Imperial gave away a consolation try!)\n, their biggest win of the season. Big\nhits were going on all over the pitch,\nnon more so than the one from flanker\nFlannan O\u2019Mahony. Captain Andrew\nJasudasen was at his peak, as was James\nPetit, both of who worked hard.\nOverall, despite the large number of\nchanges, Imperial performed superbly,\nhave secured the league win and what\nis sure to be promotion to the Premiership next year.\nFlannan O\u2019Mahony putting in a bit hit, with the pack ready to support\nJovan Nedi\u0107\nSports Editor\nWith many of Imperials\u2019 clubs having\nfinished their league seasons, BUSA\ncup and shield matches could get un-derway. Wednesday was no exception,\nwith 8 teams playing this week, and\na further 5 to start their first round\ngames next week.\nAs a quick round up, Imperial did\nfairly well with 4 of the teams winning and 4 losing. Men\u2019s Hockey got\nup extremely early to travel all the way\nto Plymouth to play the College of St.\nMark & St. John. Thankfully the epic\njourney was not worth it in the end\nwith Imperial winning 4 - 1 and now\nface either Gloucestershire or Chichester in the quarter-finals.\nWomen\u2019s Volleyball played Team\nBath winning 3 - 1, and now they face\nthe epic journey to Plymouth to play\nthe College of St. Mark & St. John.\nMen\u2019s Squash have been the dominant\nforce this season, beating every team 5\n- 0. Exeter were no exception as Imperial brushed them aside with another\n5 - 0 win.\nAnd now we come to the main point\nof the headline. This Thursday, Imperials netball team, who have also been\nundefeated this season, were scheduled\nto play Westminster in the BUSA Cup\ngame. Unfortunately the game had to\nbe cancelled because the Westminster\ngirls all had dates organised for Thursday, and as such they were unable to\nput a team out. There are several problems with this, firstly there was the\ninitial confusion of who Imperial were\nmeant to be playing, and after this was\nsorted out, both side agreed on Thursday to play the match since Wednesday was too short notice. Westminster\nthen turn round and said that the girls\ndidn\u2019t really want to play because it was\nValentine\u2019s Day and so BUSA handed\nImperial the walkover.\nJust goes to show the determination of Imperial teams, whether it be a\n5 hour journey down to Plymouth or\nre-arranging your plans for Valentine\u2019s\nDay, to play a cup game so that the club\ncan improve.\nGeneric Valentine\u2019s Day crap\n\n"

It won\u2019t happen again.\nGood luck with this one.\nHow to play:\nCrudely speaking, Slitherlink is similar to Minesweeper mixed with a\ndash of Sudoku.\nThe object of the game is to draw\nlines between the dots to create one\nlong, and most importantly, looping\nline. It should have no start or finish;\njust like an elastic band.\nEach number indicates how many\nlines should be drawn around it, for\nexample:\nCells which don\u2019t contain a number\ncan be surrounded by any number of\nlines.\nRemember, the line must form a\nloop, so the line cannot branch. The\nfollowing situations are not allowed:\nSquares are not allowed either. There\nare never cells containing the number\n4 in Slitherlink.\nSo, where do you start?

Dr.\nRowan Williams spoke out to encourage the introduction of some aspects\nof sharia law into England\u2019s judiciary\nsystem, provoking much debate from\nMuslim, Christian, and other parties.\nIn a BBC Radio 4 interview, the Archbishop disclosed his ideas on \u201chow the\nlaw and religious community, religious\nprinciples are best accommodated\u201d,\nincluding how it is \u201cunavoidable\u201d that\nvarious elements of the Muslim sharia\nlaw be introduced into English law.\nThe Archbishop believes this would\nhelp maintain social cohesion in this\ncountry, which is a very important part\nof maintaining our impressive degree\nof multiculturalism. Dr. Williams\u2019s ideas for integration of sharia law would\nonly extend as far as allowing courts\nto be held in cases to do with marital\ndisputes or financial matters. The religious should not have to choose between \u201cthe stark alternatives of cultural\nloyalty or state loyalty\u201d, he added.\nSharia law is a social and legal code\ndeveloped over many years by Islamic\nscholars, designed to guide Muslims\nin their life. The European Court of\nHuman Rights regards sharia law as\nincompatible with democracy, largely\nbased upon some of the penalties required including public executions\nand stoning. However, even within the\nMuslim community there is debate;\none of the most influential Muslim\nthinkers in Europe, Tariq Ramadan,\nhas called for a moratorium on these\npenalties as they are almost impossible to re-introduce in today\u2019s society.\nDr. Williams stressed he was not call-James Goldsack ing for a parallel judiciary for Muslims\nbut to allow Muslims, and those of all\nfaiths, to be able to act in a lawful manner according to their own religious\nconscience. The Archbishop added\nthat it relies upon sharia law being\nbetter-understood by the general public and there is no way he is advocating\nthe inhumanity commonly associated\nwith it.\nMany members of both the Anglican\nChurch and the law have condemned\nsuch ideas, as one \u201cimportant pillar\u201d of\nEnglish law is the system of one law for\neveryone. There are exceptions to this,\nsuch as the Orthodox Jewish Beth Din\ncourts. These courts are legally recognised in English law as a means for\nwarring parties to agree to arbitration.\nNo one can be forced into these courts\nas English law still governs above all.\nAn equivalent system to the Beth Din\nalready exists to implement sharia law\nto a limited extent in this country and\nboth can only deal with civil matters.\nAny introduction of parallel law for\ncriminal matters will be disastrous\nfor the legal system of England. Many\nscholars and members of the general\npublic agree. There are reservations\namongst women and other \u201cvulnerable\u201d groups that allowing expansion\nof sharia law would infringe their human or legal rights. Many women have\nalready found that despite getting a divorce legally in English law, their husbands or communities do not accept\nthis unless it is done according to Muslim law. This evidently shows how in\nmany areas of the English community\nEnglish law is not considered highly;\nthis cannot be allowed to slip away any\nfurther. There are cases springing up\nof cultural \u201ccourts\u201d being set up, such\nas an unofficial Somali court in southeast London. These act as courts for\nthose who believe that the laws of their\nplace of birth or cultural identity are\nmore relevant and more important\nthan those of the country they live in.\nIn the case of sharia law, a survey of\n500 British Muslims in February 2006\nshowed that only 40% would welcome\nthe introduction of sharia law into the\nlegal system of those areas of England\nthat are predominantly Muslim.\nThe Archbishop\u2019s comments were\nunhelpful not only because there are\nalready arbitration laws and religious\ncourts in this country, but also because the word \u201csharia\u201d is emotive as\nit is most commonly associated with\nthe brutal penalties required. When\nreligious arbitration was introduced in\nCanada as late as 2005 there were ri-ots, showing how unpopular even this\ninitial step was. The Muslim Council\nof Britain opposes the idea of a parallel legal system for Muslims or any\nperson, though thanked Dr. Williams\nfor attempting to bridge the gap between Christians and Muslims in Britain and his \u201cthoughtful intervention\u201d.\nThough no stranger to controversy \u2013\none need only look to the appointing\nof homosexual priests as one example\n\u201cHe was not\ncalling for a\nparallel judiciary\u201d\nThe Archbishop, Dr. Rowan Williams, has faced calls to resign\nKadhim Shubber\nPolitics Editor\nGreetings, my minions! Uh, sorry,\nwrong document, I mean, hello read-ers, welcome to my first and hopefully\nnot last editorial column. All I have to\ndo is avoid skewing the elections and I\nshould manage to get to the end of Friday with my head attached.\nLast week\u2019s politics section contained\nan error. I\u2019m really, really sorry, and\nhopefully if you forgive me then we can\ncontinue together learning about the\npolitical world. The article about Super Tuesday implied that Mitt Romney\nwas still in the race for the Republican\npresidential nomination. However,\nwhen Felix was published on Friday\nmorning this was no longer true.\nLet me explain why this isn\u2019t my fault\nand is in fact the result of the evil machinations of the Republican party. Felix\nis sent to print on Thursday at 5 p.m.\nThe news was true on Wedneday when\nI wrote it, and before Felix was sent to\nprint. After it was sent to print, Mitt\nRomney, hereby renamed That Prick\nWho Had To Pull Out Of The Race After Felix Was Sent To Print... oh sorry,\nI kind of ruined that sentence, didn\u2019t I?\nLast week\u2019s politics section would have\nbeen a celebratory page congratulating\nJohn McCain on his victory and thanking him for being not less crazy than\nMike Huckabee.\nSo thats all cleared up, ok? Well, I\u2019m\ngoing to stop talking about it even if\nit does leave you emotionally scarred\nand unable to interact socially for\nthe rest of your life. On to important\nthings: Sabbatical, NUS, and Student\nTrustee elections! No doubt you will\nsoon be inundated with invitations to\nFacebook groups, have posters stuck\nto your face and have uber-keen candidates trying to convince you that they\nare less crazy than the other guy. One\nmight be sympathetic if you become a\nlittle fed up with the elections, and the\nfreedom from criticism that it grants\nits candidates.\nI, however, will not be sympathetic.\nStudent elections are important because the people who are elected will be\nmaking decisions on your behalf, and\nthese decisions will directly affect you.\nFor example, Stephen Brown favours\na \u2018realistic\u2019 policy on student fees, but\na different student president might be\nin the streets protesting against them\ninstead. By getting involved in the\nelections, campaigning for the candidate you prefer, and most importantly\nVOTING, you make it significantly\nless likely that your Sabbatical team for\nnext year will offend you so greatly that\nyou leave Imperial and eke out a living\non the Serengeti.\nOn a secondary (and desperate) note,\nI\u2019d like to make an appeal to the readers\nof the politics section (who obviously\nnumber in the millions). Please read\nall the content that\u2019s out there about\nworld issues, then write about them,\nthen email them to me! To summarise,\napologies about Mitt Romney, get out\nthere and find out about the elections\nand VOTE, and write for the politics\nsection. If you\u2019ve gotten this far, congratulations and please email in so that\nI know at least one person other than\nTeck and myself cares about politics.\nIslam Awareness\nWeek 2008\nAlthough this Sharia law hullabaloo could have bad consequences\nfor the poor Imam/Archbishop\nof Canterbury, ICU Islamic Society is glad about the timing. Next\nweek it will host the annual Islam\nAwareness Week at Imperial. It is\nthe age-old opportunity for those\namong us whose thirst for knowledge isn\u2019t quite quenched by The\nSun and GCSE RE. Students can\ncome along to lunchtime exhibitions on arguably \u2018the most culturally rich era of human civilisation\u2019,\nor enjoy misconception-busting\ntalks on things like the oppression/\nliberation of women by Islam.\nSo, no matter what your religious preference, come and see\nfor yourself why Islam is the fastest growing \u2018religion\u2019 in the world\n\u2013 with the majority of new muslims being western women.\nIgnorance is sometimes not\nbliss.\n\n"

    "content": "I\nreach 146 Queen Victoria Street at a few minutes past the 11am start\nbilled all over the internet, already late since I had intended to get\nthere before it all officially kicked off. As I round the corner of the\nbuilding I am handed a flyer entitled \u201cWho Is Xenu?\u201d which I don\u2019t\nhave time to read before being deafened by a 500-strong chant of \u201cWe\nAre Anonymous. We Are Legion,\u201d followed immediately by a dreadful Rick\nAstley song [Editor \u2013 how dare you blaspheme against the 80\u2019s King!] blasted\nfrom a portable hi-fi. At this point I realised that this would be a protest unlike any I have ever witnessed.\nAfter penning an article covering the initiation and announcement of the\nglobally infamous \u201cAnonymous\u201d protests a few weeks ago, my curiosity was\naroused enough to ensure that my Sunday would be spent outside the two\nmajor scientology buildings in London. Primarily to cover it for Felix, but\nalso because I was personally intrigued by the bile-filled debate and rhetoric\nfrom both sides that abounds on the internet, and by the potential that the\nprotest had to demonstrate \u201cthe power of the internet.\u201d\nFor those who have managed to avoid the controversy, it can be summed\nup in a single, simple statement: \u201cThe internet has declared war on the\n\u2018Church of Scientology;\u2019\u201d exaggerated, but not inaccurate (see box for full\nexplanation).\nI had no idea what to expect from February 10th. It was an event that could\nsignify the beginning of a global movement, a popular movement that began\nand was sustained virtually, pouring out into the real world in a manner that\nhas never been seen before; without a leader, without a clear plan. The headless body politic, ejecting a parasite. Or it could be three geeks and a sign exhibiting ignorance and irrationality, showing that virtual momentum still has\nno real bearing on the outside, another failed movement of hate. I expected\nthe latter. I expected it to be about 20 people (maximum) standing outside a\nbuilding, embarrassing themselves.\nI\u2019m confronted with 500 protesters: clad in masks to protect their identity from the perceived threat, handing out flyers, holding signs, acting as a\nsingle, outraged entity. Yet there is an inherent humour in the event. Anonymous don\u2019t take themselves very seriously, breaking into bad dancing every\nso often as someone plays a song that they all know from various \u2018memes\u2019\nthat constantly circulate (such as the \u201cFresh Prince of Bel Air\u201d theme song\nthat was played throughout the day). Their protest signs contain in-jokes and\nshamelessly geeky comedy, but also carry the message of the day. \u201cLove Scientology, Hate the CoS [\u2018Church of Scientology\u2019]\u201d says one sign. \u201cScientology\nmakes me a sad panda,\u201d says another, \u201cKnowledge is Free, Scientology\u2019s not.\u201d\nM\nost of the protestors are lined up on the pavement and\nraised walkway, wearing their masks (mostly V For Vendetta Guy Fawkes masks) on the opposite side of the road\nfrom the headquarters of the CoS\u2019 UK organisation near\nBlackfriars tube station.\nAt this early stage of the day, there are 2 police officers mounted on horse-back, approximately 7 foot-patrol police, and 1 squad van \u2013 all City of London\nPolice \u2013 guarding the main doors of the building and surrounding the main\nbody of protestors. This number increases steadily throughout the morn-ing, finally peaking at approximately 20 officers, 4 mounted police, 2 police\nvans, and a dog unit. They seem to be there mainly to make the Scientology\nstaff feel safe, and keep the protestors from blocking Queen Victoria Street.\n\u201cWe\u2019re just policing the event,\u201d said one police officer as he asked protestors\nto move away from the entrance,\u201d It\u2019s fairly quiet\u2026 simply a peaceful protest.\u201d\nThe police don\u2019t seem worried, even though they have had little information\nabout the planned protest and no leadership to meet with.\nThe \u2018Church of Scientology of London\u2019 was opened in 2006 in the very\nbuilding where L. Ron Hubbard ran the embryonic Church of Scientology in\nthe 1950s. At the gala opening, the fourth most senior City of London Police\nofficer, Chief Superintendent Kevin Hurley, gave a speech in praise of the organisation \u2013 the largest in a series of interactions between the City of London\nPolice force and the CoS in London that was investigated by the Guardian\nand other major newspapers at the time (which a man with a megaphone\nreminded the assembled protestors).\nThe building itself sits between the Anglican church of Saint Andrew by-the-Wardrobe and the BT Wholesale headquarters. Its proximity to an Anglican church is an irony not lost on Anonymous, who took relish in the\nchant of: \u201cThat\u2019s a church, that\u2019s a cult,\u201d as they point respectively at the spire\nand the CoS. My fellow reporters and I visit the rector of the church, the Reverend Alan Griffin, to ask him his opinion of the protestors and of his neighbours themselves. He said that the protestors \u201call seemed quite young, similar\nin age to most of the Scientologists that they are protesting.\u201d On Scientology,\nhis philosophy was relaxed: \u201cIt\u2019s a free world, isn\u2019t it?\u201d He\u2019d been invited into\nthe building, and some of the members had come to speak to him, but he\nwas certain that \u201cthey shouldn\u2019t call themselves a church.\u201d I ask him whether\nhe thought Scientology was a religion, and he responded without hesitation:\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s a cult. And it\u2019s definitely not Christian. They shouldn\u2019t use the cross\nin their logo.\u201d I look again at the symbol on the front of the building. It has a\ncrucifix in the centre of it; what that signifies, I\u2019m not sure.\n4 felix Friday 15 February 2008\nAn Anonymous Protest\nOn 16th January global newspapers and media reported on the internet leak of a video showing Tom\nCruise talking about his Scientology beliefs, coinciding with the publishing of an unauthorised biography\nof Mr Cruise by renowned biographer Andrew Morton. The embarrassing video, set to the \u201cMission:\nImpossible\u201d theme tune and full of controversial quotes, was posted on many news sites, but rapidly\nremoved from most after threats from the feared Scientology legal team.\nThese events and legal threats were seen as the \u2018final straw\u2019 for a community on 711Chan, one of the\ninternet\u2019s most notorious social forums, which interpreted the move as an attempt at censorship, and the\nmost recent in a series of alleged \u201cunethical practices\u201d practised by the Church. They launched a massive\nunderground campaign \u201cdeclaring war\u201d on Scientology under the moniker of \u201cAnonymous,\u201d (\u201cWe are\nAnonymous, e are Legion\u201d), issuing several Youtube messages to the world news services. Many Scientology websites have subsequently come under attack, either with Denial of Service attacks, or having the\npages themselves defaced with mocking images and sound files. One hacker even managed to replace\nthe Scientology Headquarters answerphone message to play the \u201cFresh Prince of Bel Air\u201d theme song in\nreference to Will Smith\u2019s apparent conversion to the Church of Scientology.\nOriginally intended as a news piece,\nAndrew Somerville gives a full account\nof what he saw on the day the Felix team\nspent sandwiched between Anonymous\nand the Church of Scientology\nOutside the Church of Scientology on Queen Victoria Street, 11 minutes past 11am on 11th February\nHistory of the Anonymous Protests\nAnonymous\u2019 anti-scientology stance is based on widespread allegations that the CoS is an exploitive,\nprofiteering enterprise that destroys lives and harms society.

    "content": "Update: Yahoo! rejects M$\nFelix brings readers up to speed on this gigantic corporate game of ping pong\nW\nhat breaking news\nhas come out of the\nTech companies\nthat span the surface of the world\nthis week?\nWell, to add to Microsoft\u2019s hobby of\nbuying other companies, they placed\na bid for Danger Inc, a company that\ndesigns mobile phones and produces\nsoftware for them. Looks a bit like MS\nmight be going down the phone market after Apple, but will they release\nanything that can compete with the\niPhone in terms of pure popularity?\nConversely, Apple have updated their\ntrademark to cover the Apple brand\nin the video game sector so they may\nbe going after the Xbox, trying to plug\nthe hole that will be produced when no\nPS4 is released.\nThe government has changed its regulations on who is to blame for illegal\ndownloads. They have decided to place\nthe blame in the hands of ISPs unless\nthey block the users responsible. This\nis intended to force the providers to\ntake action instead of various copyright infringement bodies.\nIntel is in more trouble as it has been\naccused of abusing its monopoly on\nthe processor market. Great news for\nAMD fans as these claims, if founded,\ncan lead to the EU confiscating 10% of\nIntel\u2019s turnover: which is an even bigger chunk of their final profit.\nThe European space program\u2019s Columbus ISS module was successfully\nattached this week after years of delays\nto its original launch and a a few minor\ndelays to the actual attachment. One of\nthe crew members was taken ill, meaning the new guy on the shuttle team\nhad to take over.\nThe kid who cracked the iPhone\nfirmware first time round has done it\nagain with the newest \u201cmost secure\u201d\nversion. Keeping in line with his previous work the recent hack is not exactly\nuser-friendly, requiring a lot of talent\nto actually take advantage of it. A simpler version will probably appear in the\nnext few weeks, prompting Apple to\nkick out yet another update. When this\ngame of back and forth is complete,\nthe iPhone will probably be the most\nsecure device on the planet.\nThere has been public debate about\nthe use of high-pitched sirens audible\nonly to youth. The intended use is to\nannoy kids so that they stay away from\nplaces they are not wanted. Some of\nyou may be familiar with the siren that\nis installed outside one of the hotels\nbetween Kensington High Street and\nImperial College. The sides of the argument are that this is a breach of human rights, but there are plenty of people who feel this is acceptable.\nThe first Google Android-enabled\nphones have been displayed by their\nmanufacturers. To those unfamiliar\nwith Android it is Google\u2019s attempt at\na operating system for phones to directly compete with Windows Mobile\nand Symbian products. The platform\nallows developers full access to the\nsource code as it uses standard Linux\ncomponents. This is in stark contrast\nwith competitors and is a million miles\naway from Apple\u2019s infamously closed\narchitecture.\nfelix@imperial.ac.uk\nTechnology\nTechnology Editor \u2013 James Finnerty\n35\nFriday 15 February 2008 felix\nJames Finnerty\nTechnology Editor\nThey think they are onto a winner with all the investment interests but are they pricing themselves out of the market?\nW\nell, to follow up on\nthe big article last\nweek, the two partners in this shotgun\nmarriage have been\nhaving a bit of a lover's tiff. First, Yahoo\nrejected Microsoft's very generous offer due to it \u201cnot being good enough\u201d\nand now Microsoft's Steve Ballmer has\noutdone himself with the statement\nthat he rejects Yahoo's rejection. A\nvery creative way to dodge the bullet\nthat will be fired from the hip of Microsoft's very loyal shareholders.\nMicrosoft's \u00a322 billion offer topped\nYahoo's share price by 60% so it is possible for M$ to go down the hostile\ntakeover route as this would also save\nthem a substantial amount of cash but\nreduce the potency of the resultant\ncompany due to resentment between\nthe corporate bodies. Yahoo have said\nthey won't accept less than $40 billion on the share which would require\nan offer in the \u00a325-30 billion region;\nhighly unlikely as Microsoft's share\nprice has fallen since the original bid,\nreducing the original offer to around\n\u00a320 billion. It's been a long time since\nYahoo has been worth the money it's\nasking for and it may never be worth\nit; maybe Yahoo's management are\ngrabbing at pennies in an attempt to\ncut their losses before Yahoo lose any\nmore of the market.\nAnalysts feel the only reason Yahoo\nhave rejected the initial offer is in a\npoor attempt to drive up the price Microsoft is offering. Another possibility\nis the fact that since the announcement\nof the bid last week, Yahoo's share price\nhas been on the up as people want to\nget in on the action that will be MicroHoo. This is likely to go down again\nthough people are unlikely to want\nanything to do with Yahoo if it decides\nto continue as a lone entity.\nTo add more fuel to the fire of Yahoo's money-grabbing (admittedly this\nis business) it has emerged that they\nare planning to begin talks with AOL\nover a possible merger. Now it appears\nthat Yahoo thinks they are a bit of a\ngoldmine due to MS's advances; but as\nwe all know, this move is out of necessity so Yahoo going after other people\nseems a little bit off the mark. On the\nother hand, it would be quite interesting if something actually came of\nthis. The thing is that AOL's subscribers have been dropping like flies so a\nmerge would correspond to two stones\nclinging together for life in the online\nadvertisement ocean.\nThis merger needs to happen fast,\nthough, as Google currently holds a\n60% stake in the online advertisement\nbusiness and even if MS and Y join they\nwill only hold 30% between; meaning\nthey're still going to have to play catch-up.Microsoftislikelytoupthepressure\nconstantly until Yahoo submit because\nthey know as well as everyone else it's\none of their best chances of regaining\ncontrol of the market. The ridiculous\nrumours of Google taking on Yahoo\nare still being fuelled from somewhere\nas well. Monopoly, anyone?\nWell I'm sure you'll get to hear more\nabout this from me next week when\nsome other weird news develops from\nthis but hopefully they can just resolve\nthis quickly as they are only minimizing the actual effect of the merger.\nNokia has a new flagship\nFelix covers Nokia\u2019s follow up to its successful N95 model \u2013 will it be good enough?\nSuperphone \u2013 Nokia N96\nN\nokia have announced\nanother follow-up to\nthe widely popular N95\nand N95 8Gb phones.\nTypical business plan we\nhave here. Wait till everyone buys your\ntop-range phone and then release one\nto take its place. At least it's got some\ncool new features, but it really doesn't\noffer enough to justify the bother of an\nupgrade. Right. That\u2019s my opinion out\nof the way. Let\u2019s cover the handset with\na tad more objectivity, just for fun.\nThe N96 contains everything its predecessors had to offer and a handful\nmore. It has a whopping 16Gb built-in\nstorage as well as a MicroSD card read-er. The N95 only had the card reader\nand the N95 8Gb had, you guessed it,\n8Gb built-in and no card reader. So\nwith this potent combination when\nthe SDHC standard is maxed out, this\nphone will be able to store 48Gb of data\non flash. I will let you do the math on\nhow many hours of media that equates\nto.\nThe 5 Megapixel camera has nothing\nnew but sees a slight tweak in the addition of a dual LED flash instead of\na single. It will satisfy those who hold\nthat the N95's flash was a little bit of a\nweakling.\nThe big step is that this phone is going\nto be the first to come with a TV tuner\nbuilt in. Amazing. If we didn't already\nhave enough ways to procrastinate,\nthen daytime TV\u2019s offering of Jeremy\nKyle and Judge July are sure to top us\nup.\nThe handset also contains what has\nbeen dubbed \u2018Assisted GPS\u2019. What was\nwrong with regular GPS, dare I hear\nyou say? Well, it was plagued with poor\n\u201cfind\u201d times but once it knew where\nyou were it could track you pretty well.\nSo how have they fixed this flaw? Basically a server figures out roughly where\nyou are in the world using the mobile\nphone masts through which you are\nconnected. This info is used to help the\nsatellite find you faster.\nThe N96 is also confirmed to contain\nNokia's now slightly aged N-Gage plat-form. With some tweaks and updates\nthis could provide a very promising\nselling point if the Nintendo DS' record\nsales are anything to go by. So with a\ngames console, internet , GPS , TV and\nall the other endless feature sets available across the broad market of hand-sets, I wonder if and when we will say\nthe creatives get stuck for ideas.\nA nifty little feature that goes hand\nin hand with the ever growing video-playing nature of phones is a small\nkickstand located on the back allowing\nyou to place it on any flat surface, sit\nback and enjoy your film. Similar to the\nlittle stands provided with Apple iPod's\nand iTouch's but with the practicality\nof being attached to the device.\nA small flaw that some sources have\nmentioned is that this device may not\nsupport full-on 3G, reducing the speed\nof its mobile Internet and removing\nvideo calls. A bit of a downer for the\nUK market; for the people over the\npond 3G won't work anyway so it won't\nmake a difference. Nokia also released\nthe N96's sister device in the same an-nouncement. The N78 contains a very\nsimilar feature set to its sibling but is a\nmore traditional soap-bar style handset rather than a slide model. This guy\nhas some cool but slightly gimmicky\nfeatures as well. Using its A-GPS it can\ngeo-tag any photos you take; in other\nwords it remembers where you took all\nyour photos and allows you to view a\nmap with photos marked out as loca-tions. Also it contains an FM transmitter allowing you to play your music\nthrough your car radio without wires,\nnothing new to media players but new\nto phones.\nSo, in conclusion, this doesn't really appear to be a true flagship successor but\nit is pushing the envelope forward towards a device that will be as popular.\n\n"

I know I\u2019ll be ordering the crocheted deer head. (Although\nI\u2019ll recraft it into a unicorns head).\nNicole Miller\u2019s gimmick was Joan of\nArc, a teenage warrior, with a collection of urban yet girly pieces.

It was a doll-like yet gothic\ncollection, with dark colours mixing with girly pastels and splashes of\nbrights. There were plenty of crino-lined dresses and skirts, mixed with\nsheer frilled blouses.\nThakoon looked like something a\nslightly deranged english rose would\nwear in the \u201820s.

I\nparticularly enjoy the lateral thinking\nthat is involved in solving such a puz-zle, and, despite me being in the computing department, have not yet felt\nthe need to create my own automated\ncomputer solver for the puzzle.\nRecently I have noticed that the techniques required to solve slitherlink are\nbecoming more and more lateral. This\nweek, the step was particularly lateral,\nin the literal sense. Just as I got stuck, I\nrealised the solution was staring me in\nthe face \u2026 slightly to the right of where\nmy pen was currently placed.\nI am also faced with a feeling of deja-vu, being sure that I have actually seen\nthis puzzle before, last week perhaps?\nHowever, on closer inspection the solution which was horizontally offset is\nnot identical to the problem I currently\nface (and have faced before). A mystery\n2 seems to have appeared thatmakes\nthings seem less ambiguous.\nAnd now I will get to the thrust of\nthis email: Have I spent so long staring\nat the dots and lines that madness has\nensued or has this happened to yourself or your good staff?\nKindest regards,\nTristan Allwood\nPh.D. Student\nThanks to everyone who pointed this\nout. Honestly. Every last one of you. It\nwon\u2019t happen again!\nLateral thinking:\nSlitherlink woes\nFun with\napostrophe\u2019s and\nswear words\nSir,\nI read with much enjoyment the article\nentitled \"Got more cash than sense?\"\nuntil I reached paragraph five, sentence one in which the writer states:\n\"... and 8Gb's of flash storage built-in\".\nI do believe that according to the Oxford Dictionary of Style (Oxford being\na University, much like ours) the an\napostrophe before an 's' is the sole domain of the Greengrocer.\nFurthermore I wish to issue a fresh\ncomplaint over the character immei-dately preceding the one about which\nI have just complained. The unit 'gi-gabyte' is abbreviated thus: 'Gb'. An\nabbreviation of 'Gb' would signify one\ngigabit which is a significantly smaller quantity than the one I might be\nso bold as to presume the writer had\nintended.\nI suspect that the oversights I mention have been faithfully reproduced in\nevery single copy of felix printed this\nweek, and therefore that my copy is not\nan anomaly, however, since I have not\npaid for the copy of Felix about which I\nam writing I shall not expect any monetary recompense from yourselves.\nIn addition to the above complaints\n(whichIbelievetobesufficientgrounds\nfor a full and frank appology issued\nby yourselves to your perfectly well-intended readers) I would like to issue\none further complaint about the use of\nthe common vernacular in a published\nmedium. On page 35 the headline of\nan otherwise very enjoyable article\nreads \"Oh sweet, sweet CNUT\". If we\nare to believe that these letters might\n(by some series of random experiments constituting a stochastic proc-ess) become rearranged then there is\nsignificant chance that the headline\ncould display something ultimately of-fensive. As shown recently in a study\nby Cambridge University which you\nyourselves mentioned in an issue last\nyear, the order of the intermediary letters in a word is not important to the\noverall cognition - a fact about which I\ndoubt, Sir, you are ignorant. Therefore\nI believe it to be an act of wilful sin that\n\"Oh sweet, sweet CNUT\" was printed\nwith full knowledge that it will be interpreted as common slang for an area\nof the female undercarriage.\nYours,\nJames Dicken\nElectrical Engineering\nSCR letter\nclarification\nDear Felix,\nFollowing up from the letter I submitted to Felix last month concerning the\nSenior Common Room, I would like to\ngive some feedback from a meeting I\nhad with Jane Neary, Head of Catering\nand Conferencing in the SCR; Chileya\nKasuba, Faculty and Postgraduate co-ordinator; and several other MSc stu-dents. My letter questioned the current rule that taught masters students\nare not allowed to buy or eat food in\nthe SCR, and thus do not have a designated area to have lunch or coffee. It\nalso highlighted the shocking behaviour of a member of Imperial academic\nstaff.\nI would like to clarify that my complaint was not directed at any members of the catering staff. As far as I am\naware, the catering staff have always\nbeen polite and amenable to all cus-tomers, and they try hard to balance\nthe demands of both the academics\nand students. I apologise if the letter\ncaused any misunderstanding or upset\nto anyone within the catering team.\nThe meeting covered both short-term and long-term solutions to the\nSCR rules issue, and a proposal will\nbe submitted to the SCR committee\nin due course. It is this committee that\nmakes the decisions about who is allowed into the SCR. In the mean time,\nI would like to emphasise the fact that\nMSc students do not currently have\na designated place to eat and meet,\nwhether it be to discuss work over a\ncoffee or to catch up over lunch.\nDavid Stacey\nTom Roberts responds:\nAh, the annual pedantry letter. I\u2019ve\nbeen expecting you, albeit with not\nquite such an amusing tone.\nMr. Dicken: Thank you for bringing a\nsmile to my face on such inane topics.\nYou are of course correct on both counts\nand my frank apology is forthcoming:\nSorry.\nI have brutally beaten the editors\nresponsible for the apostrophe calamity and burned the pages of the Oxford\nDictionary of Style onto their retinas.\nUnfortunately I have run out of soap.\nNot only am I an incredibly pungent\nindividual, the Felix staffers\u2019 mouths\nremain as obscene as ever.\n\n"

    "content": "16 felix Friday 15 February 2008\npolitics.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nPolitics\nDry Wit & Tonic\nvent any agreement between the two\ntitans.\nThe job of vice president would almost be humiliating to Hillary Clinton,\nnot to mention the problem of where\nher entourage would fit into the White\nHouse. The role of vice president\ndoesn\u2019t allow enough space for Hillary\u2019s political hangers-on, specifically\nher husband Bill.\nA greater issue lies with Obama\u2019s\nsupport base. The bottom would fall\nout almost immediately. By accepting\nHillary into the fold, Obama would\ninstantly betray his supporters and\nhis campaign angle. He is the candidate of change, a convincing candidate\nof change. He excites young people\nabout politics, brings the voters out in\ndroves, and convinces them that there\nis hope for America\u2019s political system,\nthat he is going to breathe fresh air into\nCapitol Hill. A Clinton vice presidency\nwould essentially be a large amount of\nold baggage that is completely at odds\nwith Obama\u2019s message of change. He\nhas attacked Hillary\u2019s record on Iraq,\nwhile boasting of his clean one. Inviting Hillary as his running mate would\nonly stain his record on Iraq and would\nbe seen by his idealistic support as a\nbetrayal of his principles.\nTo be more simplistic, many of\nObama\u2019s supporters do not like Hillary.\nThere are a large number of young vot-ers, who Obama has inspired, who simply despise Hillary. One anti-Hillary\ngroup on Facebook has over 800,000\nmembers. For these voters, a Hillary\nvice presidency will poison them into\napathy and deny Obama the support\nof young people that he needs to fight\nJohn McCain.\nSwitching the roles does not offer\nany reason to be optimistic. There is\nno question of Obama entertaining\nthe thought of submitting to be Hillary\u2019s vice president for a number of\nvery good reasons. He is not out of\nthe race; in fact, since Super Tuesday\nObama has been doing very well for\nhimself. Last weekend he had a clean\nsweep, winning Washington state, Nebraska, Louisiana, Maine, and the US\nVirgin Islands. The Clinton campaign\nwas clearly rattled by Obama\u2019s ability\nto regain momentum so quickly after\nSuper Tuesday, so much in fact that\nher campaign manager has resigned\nand been replaced by Maggie Williams, known as the ultimate loyalist,\nunwavering in her devotion to Hillary\nfor nearly a quarter of a century. The\nClinton campaign is obviously rattled\nenough to bring out the big guns. Any\nindication that Obama is considering\na deal with Hillary will see his support\ngo out the door; they will believe that\nby voting for Hillary they\u2019ll get all the\nstuff they liked in Obama too. A large\nproportion will probably jump out the\nwindow at the thought that their man\nof change was selling himself to the\nClinton establishment. The Obama\ncampaign is very clear on this issue.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not running for vice president,\u201d\nsaid Obama spokesman Robert Gibbs.\nBut even if Obama were to essentially admit defeat and begin to consider being vice president, he would\nfind only that the wool had been pulled\nover his eyes and that the reality of\nbeing vice president to Hillary hardly\nallowed him to push his solutions and\nideas. Whoever finds him or herself as\nvice president to Hillary will quickly\nfind that the White House is Clinton\nterritory. There is little doubt that Bill\nintends to play a major role during\nhis wife\u2019s presidency. The No. 2, the\nvice president, will really be the No. 3\nto husband Bill, who has said, \u201cI\u2019ll be\nthere, talking her through everything;\nlike she did with me\u201d.\nAmongst Hillary Clinton\u2019s supporters and campaigners also, there isn\u2019t\nvery much desire for an Obama vice\npresidency. The Clinton campaign is\ninstitutional; it draws its support from\npolitical veterans stretching deep into\nthe 80s and 90s. Their contact book\nhas over 25 years of political allies,\nadministrators, and campaign loyal-ists. Senator Obama is certainly not on\ntheir contact list; he is a relative newcomer and not part of the Democratic\nestablishment, and many of Clinton\u2019s\nsupporters question Obama\u2019s loyalty.\nThe Clinton\u2019s define loyalty in terms of\nstaying power; if you\u2019re fired you simply wait for your next opportunity to\nhelp the Clintons. The very fact that\nObama ran against Hillary is counter\nto this interpretation of loyalty, and\nsome zealots in the Clinton campaign\neven consider the existence of his campaign offensive.\nThings are looking pretty grim, I\nthink you\u2019ll agree. However, these pre\u201cThe job of vicePresident would\nbe humiliating\nfor Hillary\u201d\n\u201cSince SuperTuesday Obama\nhas been doing\nvery well\u201d\n\u201cThere isn\u2019t\nmuch desire for\nan Obama vicePresidency\u201d\ndictions and arguments are only valid\nin the present, at a time when these\ntwo candidates are toe-to-toe, neck\nand neck, both with a real chance of\nwinning. Come the Democratic Party\nNational Convention a winner will\nbe chosen. It will be a close and nail-biting event, and a huge proportion of\nthe party will have to swallow a candidate that they didn\u2019t even vote for. It\nis in these conditions that we can see\nan agreement being made. The Democratic Party must be unified in support\nof its candidate in order to prevent\nJohn McCain stealing independents\nand moderates away from them. By\nreconciling Hillary and Obama, in a\nformidable team, the Democratic party could sincerely say that they were\n100% behind their candidate. Hillary\nmight accept a vice president position\nas a springboard for future presidential\nelections. Of course the same applies\nfor Obama, although he is guaranteed\na dazzling political future regardless of\nthe outcome. A successful Democratic\npresidency with both Obama and Hillary onboard could set the stage for the\ndomination of U.S. politics by the democrats for years to come. By the end of\n2008, we could see posters of Hillary\nand Obama side-by-side, saying, \u201cGet\non board!\u201d The Democratic Party will\nbe, touch wood, unstoppable.\nHillary Clinton is certain to keep this look on her face throughout her hypothetical vice-presidency\n\n"

Picture-taking is\ncompulsory when you are straddling\nthe Greenwich Mean Time line. Violence with tourists may be necessary if\nyou do not have a good spot.\nOne website to check out before you\ngallivant off is www.greenwichwhs.org.\nuk. This is a good site detailing all the\nthings to do.\nSo, without further ado, here are The\nThings One is Expected to do when\nOne finds Oneself in the tranquil surI\nf you\u2019ve had enough of central\nLondon, I have the solution.\nWandering along the river in\nan easterly direction you will\neventually stumble across the\nvillage of Greenwich on the south side\nof the Thames. It is a funny place, being green and quiet yet still urban and\nquirky. If you start to miss the corporate whoreage of Central London,\nyou can quite clearly see the Great\nGrey Towers of Canary Wharf directly\nacross the river which will make you\nfeel better again.\nGreenwich is an area of great historical and scientific significance. It is best\nknown for its naval history, and for being the site of a Royal Palace. The Palace of Placentia, as it was named, was\nironically the birthplace of many famous royals including Henry VIII and\nElizabeth the 1st.\nThe palace was then neglected for\nseveral years as the Cavaliers and\nRoundheads battled it out, before being adopted by Sir Christopher Wren\nand turned into a naval college for\nyoung sea-loving types. Nowadays, the\npalace houses the National Maritime\nMuseum, Trinity College of Music and\nGreenwich University\u2026 a long way\nfrom its Royal Placenta days.\nThe town itself has grown up around\nthe central nucleus of the palace and\nits splendid observatory. As naval officers moved in circa 1830, lots of\ngrand houses popped up around the\nRoyal Park. These are now populated\nwith Canary Wharf\u2019s CEOs who work\nacross the water. How convenient.\nHow to get there: A stopping train\nfrom Waterloo to Greenwich is the\nmost convenient way to get there, I\nreckon. And it only costs \u00a32 return and\ntrains are quite frequent too! Check\ntimes before you go on www.national-rail.co.uk. When you arrive at Greenwich station follow the nice black\ntouristy signs to Greenwich Village. It\u2019s\nabout a 10 minute walk.\nroundings of Greenwich:\n1. National Maritime Museum\nThis museum is lovely. It is new and\nspangley, set inside part of the Royal\nPalace. It mostly showcases our Naval\nhistory and the past, present and future of our oceans. I approve. (www.\nnmm.ac.uk, admission free)\n2. Royal Observatory\nThis historic building is actually part\nof the NMM. Places like this make me\nsmile. The buildings of the Observatory have splendid classical architecture\nmade with warming red bricks and\nelegant domes. It is the site of great\nscientific advancement, so obviously\nthey have put lots of hands-on exhibitions up there to advance your 12-year\nold knowledge of space, time and the\nuniverse.\n3. The Planetarium\nThe Planetarium is terribly dramatic.\nIt is well worth paying \u00a33 to see one\nof the shows there, although if you are\ndoing a Physics degree you may not\nappreciate the basic science of Black\nHoles thrown at you. Even so, it\u2019s pretty cool having a 3D red giant coming\nout of the screen towards you, or seeing the entire Milky Way above your\nhead. Seats are reclining, of course, so\nyou can relax under the stars!\nOn another note, the hill that spirals\nup to the Observatory is very steep and\ncarries a health warning.\n4. Greenwich Royal Park\nWhat\u2019s big, green and has lots of hills?\n(Insert Shrek gag here.) With wonderful views over London from the park it\nis definitely worth the climbs!\n5. The Old Naval College\nOn the site of the Tudor palace where\nHenry VIII and Elizabeth I were born,\nthese buildings form the centrepiece of\none of this country's finest examples of\nBaroque landscape. They were planned\nand designed by some of the greatest\narchitects of the day. The magnificent\nPainted Hall is where Nelson's body lay\nin state after his death at the Battle of\nTrafalgar. Admission is free (yippee!).\n6. Cutty Sark\nThe fastest sailing ship of her day, the\nCutty Sark was launched in Scotland\nin 1869 and initially sailed on the tea\nroute to China. Later, she brought back\nwool from Australia. She has been in\ndry dock in Greenwich since 1954.\nHowever, some chavs burnt this\nbeautiful tea clipper down last year.\nThe Cutty Sark Foundation is desperately trying to put the pieces back\ntogether. You cannot access the ship\nanymore. Despair not: there is a small\nvisitor centre next to it on Greenwich\nmarina where they tell us about the\nrestoration effort. (www.cuttysark.org.\nuk)\n7. Greenwich Village\nThe usual suspects line the high street\nbut there are still plenty of independent shops down the quaint alleyways\nthat scurry around the old town.\nGreenwich market is the largest of the\nmarkets in Greenwich and is definitely\nworth poking around for a while.\nWith the weather we\u2019ve been having recently, Greenwich should really\nbe at the top of your agenda. It has a\nreal buzz and it is hard to believe how\nclose you are to Central London when\nyou see all the green. It\u2019s a real breath\nof fresh air.\nRosie Grayburn takes you away from the chaotic city to the calm and tranquillity of Greenwich\nThe Old Naval College; offering the finest degrees in belly-button studies this side of the GMT divide\nThe Cutty Sark back in its hay-day The National Maritime Museum sprouting an onion bulb\n\n"

    "content": "Recently I was intrigued by a police\ncordon set up in Hyde Park not far across\nthe road from the Union Building. These\nscenes spark illusions of crime and\nintrigue and exciting ideas of CSI-style\npolice dramas. I was horrified to learn\nlater that a young girl had been sexually\nassaulted right on our very doorstep and\nthis suddenly brought the whole thing\ninto stark contrast.\nUnfortunately crimes are not uncommon\nin Hyde Park. Thefts and mugging are\na regular occurrence and approximately\nonce a month a CID officer is called in\nto investigate a more serious crime. And\nit doesn\u2019t stop there, absent mindedly\nholding the door open into the Sherfield\nBuilding a few weeks back I was\nsurprised to meet two extremely polite\npolice officers walking in the opposite\ndirection with a rather more sullen\nlooking guy in handcuffs between them.\nI know first hand that crime can occur\neven when you feel safe on campus.\nDuring a spate of thefts last year I lost\nmy favourite handbag with my brand\nnew phone, my lecture notes, a really\nnice pair of earrings and all my bank\ncards.

I\u2019m also never hungry and I am\neating all the time because I snack on\nthings like fruit or nuts or dried fruit or\nlow-calorie things and still manage to\nlose weight and speed up my metabolism as well. I\u2019m more active now and\ntry to make it to the gym 3-4 times a\nweek even if it is for half an hour. If I\nhave more time I\u2019ll do my weight training routine and I spend an hour to an\nhour-and-a-half on one of the cardio\nmachines. Sometimes I go to classes\nand will do half-an-hour cardio after\nthe class if I have time. I\u2019ve also realised\nthat I get bored with cardio really easily but it\u2019s the best way to beat fat, so\nI make a point of changing machines\nand doing interval training so it doesn\u2019t\nget too mundane. By doing cardio and\nweight training, I am getting rid of\nbody fat by burning it off and developing muscle, so it\u2019s kind of like a two-way attack on fat!\n47\nfelix\nFriday 15 February 2008\nsport.felix@imperial.ac.uk Sport\nOnly one more mouthful\u2026?\nLinda Hagg\nEnergia Fitness Instructor\nSports league\nOne of the participants of Ethos\u2019\nweight management programme has\nbeen willing to share her experiences\nof the programme and tell us how she\nis getting on. She kept a food diary for\nthree days and recorded how physically active she was.\nKeeping a food diary is a good way\nto monitor what and how much you\neat in order to improve your diet. You\nwill also be able to ensure you have a\nbalanced diet, eating food from all\nfood groups. It can help you create an\nawareness of unnecessary food and\nsnacks you eat or it can stop you from\neating that extra biscuit. Sometimes\nyou eat more than you think without\neven realising it\u2026.\nMy food diary:\nI have lost roughly half a stone in\nthe past 4 weeks although last week I\nended up gaining a bit of weight, due to\nbeing extremely busy and having to attend two parties during the week. Previously I\u2019ve lost weight through a combination of cardio and weight training\nwhich did work but then after a blip of\ncouple of weeks and not going to the\ngym, it just ended up in me putting the\nweight back on. Not being aware of\n\u2018hidden calories\u2019 for example in lattes\netc. and going for things like cakes to\navoid having a chocolate bar ( I didn\u2019t\nrealise I was going for the higher fat,\nsugar and calorie option!) has been one\nof the reasons for me not being able to\nstay at my desired weight.\nSunday, 03 February 2008:\nBreakfast: 2 pieces of Weetabix with\napproximately 150 ml of milk and a\ncup of tea with semi-skimmed milk\nand two teaspoons of sugar\nSnack: A Cadbury cake bar, a pear\nand a banana and a 2-slices Go-ahead\nyoghurt breaks\nLunch: A chickpea salad (handful),\nwith a small baked potato, quarter of\na cucumber, a little onion and 2 carrots topped off with lemon and chat\nmasala.\nDinner: Very late. 2 chapattis and a\nlow fat homemade chicken curry approximately 150 ml of curry with a\npiece of chicken.\nActivity: General house chores, as it\nwas a rest day.\nReview: The day could\u2019ve gone better\nbut mistimed meals and did not have\nenough healthy snacks in the house\nwhich meant that I overindulged.

    "content": "\u201cFelix shall be editorially free to operate and report on events as the Editor sees fit, as long as he or she is not acting\nagainst the wider student interest... \u201d \u2013 Union Policy on Felix\nThis week Felix News has three major stories that we are unable to publish due to prohibitive regulations that govern the\nUnion in general. Rather than fill these pages will second-rate material, we feel it is our duty to inform our readership that\nwe are not able to discuss certain important student issues, despite the official policy (stated above) that is supposed to\ngovern this publication.\nFelix is not able to report on matters concerning Election candidates\u2019 past or present during the election period, no\nmatter how factual.\nIf one of the election candidates came down into the Felix office and set fire to the computers whilst chanting racist hate slogans and kicking a granny, we would not be able to report or publish evidence on it, without being immediately impounded\nas soon as the candidate complained that we had influenced the election. This is due to interpretation of the \u2018Elections\u2019\nsection of the constitution, viewing Felix as holding a privileged position as the only student newspaper of Imperial College\nUnion.\nThe argument stems from a part of the Union constitution which states in (Regulation 4 part G43 for the hacks) that: \u201cAll\nmedia or newsletter reports, or comments, must mention the names of all candidates standing for a post within the body of\nthe report, in the case of elections.\u201d This is the only reference to the news media coverage of candidates in the constitution\nregulations. It is intrepreted by the Union as not allowing Felix or any other Union media to publish an article during an\nelection that concerns one candidate alone, even if it gave a token mention to the other candidates as an aside.\nFelix was given the official Union position on this matter after one of the major stories this week concerns a presidential\ncandidate and their actions over the past six months. Felix cannot publish these events without risking censorship and exposing the editor to disciplinary action. However, Felix believes that these events are both newsworthy, and in the interests\nof the voting students.\nFelix is not able to report on matters concerning, or related in any way, to Union staff, no matter how factual.\nFelix, along with the rest of the Union, is governed by a prohibitive \u201cCode of Practice (CoP),\u201d an agreement between the Union and College, that is designed to protect both the Union and College from legal action stemming from the breach of HR\nlaw. However this CoP prevents students in any public forum (be that Council, Court or Felix) from discussing the actions,\nopinions or details of any Union Staff, or even publishing details or comment on a department of the Union itself. Felix can\npublish any material discussing members of College staff, so long as it does not breach civil or criminal law, but not even\nmention members of Union staff.\nFelix was given the official Union position on this matter after two of our stories this week were deemed to have possibly\nreflected badly on certain departments of the Union, and hence Union staff members. Felix understands that it is necessary\nfor the Union to protect itself from legal action over HR law, but believes that publication of these news stories is certainly\nin the interest of the student body, but again we cannot publish without exposing Felix to harm.\nBoth of these issues illustrate a major conflict between the intended operation of Felix (as stated in the Union Felix Policy),\nand the rules that govern many areas of Union activity that also extend over Felix, overruling the intended operation of this\nstudent newspaper.\nFelix suggests that either the Union policy governing Felix should be changed to reflect the reality of the situation \u2013 a\ngagged publication that cannot report on issues that matter most to student of this college, or the Constitution should be\nchanged to allow a truly democratic student newspaper \u2013 bound only by the public interest and UK defamation law.\nUntil then, Felix informs the students of Imperial College that it cannot publish the whole truth.\nThe cat is not free.\nThe Felix Editor and News team\n\n"

Hot Chip certainly likes dwelling in the dark... don\u2019t we all?\nOne night only at the Metro vs. Goldfrapp\nThis month, romantic, raucous, Gaelic\nrockers, Sons and Daughters release\ntheir third long player, This Gift. The\nBernard Butler (Suede, The Tears,\nMcAlmont & Butler) produced album\nis a welcome return to their roaring,\nbluesy guitars and Adele Bethel\u2019s cutting Highland tongue.\nBy their singer\u2019s own admission, the\nband wanted to create an album embracing their love for Blondie and The\nSmiths and it doesn\u2019t fall short of giving those bands a respectful nod. They\neven bring in the old Gibson guitar\nwhich Johnny Marr used to record\nStrangeways, Here We Come. Bernard\nButler is enticed away from arguing\nwith Brett Anderson and is able to add\nsparkle to the bands\u2019 own hand-crafted\nsound that has been developed over\nthe past five years. This is not without numerous artistic clashes between\nproducer and band, only resolved by a\nmutual love for Fleetwood Mac .\nThe lead single, Gilt Complex, is a\nscathing attack on the hollow celebrity culture of the 2000s. Its malevolent guitar riff cuts as sharp as Bethel\u2019s\nlyrics with her vitriol spitting out in a\nghostly harmony. \u201cHe\u2019s not sure of all\nhe has but avarice is all that he\u2019s made\nof. Everybody knows.\u201d As soon as her\ntirade dies down you\u2019re thrown into an\nill-fated story of loss backed by the violin of Cajun Dance Party.\nButler\u2019s influence seems most prominent on Rebel With A Ghost where\nSons and Daughters find a lost pop\nhook that only serves to widen their\nfolk-punk starts. At times the album is\nSusan Yu\nMusic Editor\nH\ney, I\u2019m Susan, one of\nthe new music editors,\nas Peter would have\nmentioned last week.\nMy mugshot is very\nbad. Don\u2019t laugh. Back to business,\nMUSIC is what makes my life worth\nliving, what makes me tick. I\u2019m sure\nmany of you intelligent people would\nagree. Music gets me through thick\nand thin, through times of trouble,\ngrief, anger, you name it. I have to say,\nit\u2019s one of those rare perennial sources\nof comfort that is a must when everything seems to go to pot. Who needs\necstasy or heroin when you can inherently get high from music without\nobtaining a mutilated nose and having\nyour brains messed up big time.\nMusicwise, the Grammys this year,\nwe have to give it up for Amy Winehouse. The troubled singer, currently\nin rehab, has been showered with five\ngongs. Her awards encompass the\n\u2018Song of the Year\u2019 and \u2018Record of the\nYear,\u2019 both for her signature hit \u2018Rehab,\u2019\nand as best new artist. Other notable winners were Kanye West who\nscooped four Grammys while Bruce\nSpringsteen won three. The White\nStripes, Justin Timberlake, Carrie\nUnderwood and Mary J Blige were\nfurther among the artists who picked\nup two awards.\nLook forward to an interview with\na young Scottish lady. No telling, you\njust have to wait. Tough. This week\nwe\u2019ve been flooded with reviews, hope\nthis continues, guys. Music is truly\nback on form. I digress.\nIf you fancy reviewing some\nmusic or gigs, send us an email\nat music.felix@imperial.ac.uk and\nget yourself on the mailing list.\nFree music giveaway soon, stay\ntuned!\nreminiscent of fellow Scots, Idlewild,\nduring their 100 Broken Windows de-velopment, which is no bad thing at\nall.\nThis Gift dances on and continues\nto delight the listener with references\nto iconic British cinema and literature.\nFrom Ken Loach to Billy Liar to Julie\nChristie, Adele\u2019s love for her home nations shines through. Their trademark\nCeltic oohing and aahing also finds a\ncomfortable place to reside here; most\nnotably on the title track, which begins\nwith a duel between our feisty singer\nand the imposing guitarist Scott Patterson, with his burly yet wounded\nmoans. The only winner is our aural\npleasure while the lyrics delve into\nthe stories of Ted Hughes\u2019 tragic lov-ers. The sparring vocals continue\nwith second single Darling, a product\nof the bands\u2019 love for 60s girl groups\nand shines through with its lustrous\npop glory, made ever more prominent\nwith Bernard Butler\u2019s smoothed-out\nproduction.\nThe album marches forward until\nclosing with a lament of an ending rela-tionship; Goodbye Service wails \u201cSaid\nthat you\u2019d call / Scream when you\u2019re\nleaving / At least I\u2019m heartless so you\nsparked some feeling,\u201d and leaves you\ncontemplating your recent auditory\ninvasion of the melded cacophony of\nstomping guitars, haunting vocals and\ncultured lyrics that have comprised the\npast 40 minutes.\nSoumen Sen\nJust For Tonight is the second single\nfrom Yorkshire-based urchins One\nNight Only, and is likely to make them\nbig; or at least modestly large judging\nby the amount of airplay it\u2019s getting\non Radio 1. The lead singer, George\nCraig, has mild notoriety as being the\nbrother of the drummer from the ter-ribly-named but promising, shiny, new\nNME darlings, Joe Lean And The Jing\nJang Jong. Unfortunately, they don\u2019t\nseem to borrow from The Jing Jang\nJong\u2019s jing-jangly guitars or artistic\nflair. Instead, One Night Only seem\nto have stolen Keane\u2019s piano and Embrace\u2019s way with words. This is, by no\nmeans, a good thing. This is middle-of-the-road, coffee-table rock with no\ndesire to be diverse or intriguing. The\nlyrics are mind-numbingly dull: \u201cWay\nacross the plains the lights spill out of\ncode/No one knows where they take us\nbut we\u2019ll search till we grow old\u201d and\nthe tune is so bland that it makes James\nBlunt seem cutting-edge.\nOne Night Only will probably get\na top twenty hit with this. They will\nprobably sell out a medium-sized London venue. They will probably even\nget a number one debut album. Chris\nMartin may even give them a B-side to\nrecord. The only thing that\u2019s certain is\nthat Jo Whiley will love them. That\u2019s\nguaranteed.\nSoumen Sen\nacoustic strum and simple piano riffs\ntie in well with the synthesisers, giving\nit a rich texture, greatly complementing the singing.The melody meanders\nslowly whilst Goldfrapp conveys tender longing with her beguiling purring\nlush vocals-\u2018I\u2019m in a backless dress on\na pastel ward that\u2019s shining. Think I\nwant you still.\u2019\n\u2018And I was feeling lonely, feeling blue\nFeeling like I needed you\u2019\nIt\u2019sValentine\u2019sDaythisFriday.Therelease of this melodic, ambient number\ncoincidentally will appeal to many singletons yearning for love. (Damn those\nsmug, have-it-all couples smooching in\nthe corner). With a memorable melody,\nquaint intonations and beautiful synthesisers holding everything together,\n\u2018A&E\u2019 works wonders. Just about.\nSusan Yu\nfourth album \u2018Seventh Tree\u2019 comes as\na pleasant surprise. Highly different\nfrom their previous upbeat glam-disco\nhits such as \u2018Oh La La,\u2019 \u2018Strict Machine\u2019\nand \u2018Ride A White Horse.\u2019 \u2018Seventh\nTree\u2019 offers a new change of scene\nfrom the dancefloor belters prevalent\nin their last two albums \u2018Supernature\u2019\nand \u2018Black Cherry. Instead, it sees\nGoldfrapp diverging in another direc-tion, a new sound for the band, having\ntoned down the electronics in favour of\na more organic, acoustic sound, maybe\nreverting back to nature. Who knows.\nFirst impressions of this track: considerably mellow and somewhat folky,\ntakes a while to get used to, but trust\nme, this number is indeed one of those\ntracks that takes time to grow on you.\nBoy, the more you play this, the better\nit gets. The fresh soundscape produced\nevokes a surreal dreaminess. What is\nmore, this new arrangement certainly\nallows Alison Goldfrapp to show off\nmore of her gorgeous voice. Both the\nFollowing the relatively huge success\nof \u2018The Warning\u2019, anticipation was\nlet a 5-year old go insane with an 808.\nIt all sounds deliciously lush (\u2018Don\u2019t\nDance\u2019) and crunchy (\u2018Ready For The\nFloor\u2019), but they sometimes get ahead\nof themselves. For example, there\u2019s so\nmuch going on in \u2018Touch Too Much\u2019,\nthat the cacophony of live drum machines and programmed beats renders\nthe track virtually un-danceable.\nThat\u2019s one nitpick among a handful.\nAn album ultimately reliant on its arsenal of digitised bloops and clicks may\ngive the impression of a record that is,\non initial listens, rather cold and su-perficial. However, unlike their mildly\ndistracting but clinically joyless second\nalbum, \u2018Made In The Dark\u2019 grows to\nshow a rather warm centre underneath\nall of the mechanical sequencing. Unfortunately, the album remains rather\nshallow which cuts away any chances\nof this being 2008\u2019s \u2018Sound Of Silver\u2019. But perhaps you\u2019re not supposed\nto think too much about it and as it\nstands, there are enough head-bang-ing, bouncy tunes to distract you away\nfrom any lack of depth.\nJorge Costa\nEducation Pt.2 is the debut single from\nPeckham band The Metros.\nThe song generates a strong sense of\ndeja vu from a variety of guitar bands\n\u2013 comparisons with \u2018Ian Dury and the\nBlockheads\u2019 are particularly striking\n(the record is even produced by Baxter\nDury , the son of the aforementioned).\nWhilst the track isn\u2019t going to change\nthe musical world, it boasts an interestingly loose structure. This is backed\nup by solid guitar and drum sections,\nand sprawled with a self-styled \u2018lippy\nupstarts\u2019 take on education, making an\nentertaining, if forgettable, three minutes and thirty seconds of music.\nNat\nA little different from Nick Cave\u2019s\nprevious material. One tends to be\ncautious and concerned with such\ncomebacks but it is unnecessary in\nthis case. This first whiff of the new\nalbum is refreshing, oozing with energy and a catchy tune. The sound is\nstill signature of Nick Cave & the Bad\nSeeds, with almost sermonising vocals\nover a sharp guitar riff. Lyrics are both\ninteresting and troubling. The chorus,\nhowever, is not as good as the verses.\nAll in all, though, excellent material.\nKate\nHot Chip\nMade In The Dark\n(EMI)\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2729\nAlbum Reviews high for Hot Chip\u2019s third long player.\nPromising to be rockier than their previous albums (though that\u2019s like saying\n\u2018Blackout\u2019 was slightly more avant-garde than \u2018Oops! ...I Did It Again\u2019),\n\u2018Made In The Dark\u2019 instead builds on\nHot Chip\u2019s reputation of creating ludicrously intricate indie-dance grooves\nvia bolder, brasher sounds. To paraphrase Daft Punk, this album is harder,\nbetter, faster and stronger than anything they have previously released.\nWas that a rather cheesy sentence?\nMaybe, but the comparison is warranted considering that Hot Chip takes the\nFrench duo\u2019s brand of driving synths,\nand then beats them at their own\ngame. Nowhere is this more apparent\nthan the nuclear blow-out of \u2018Shake A\nFist\u2019. As the album\u2019s first single, \u2018Fist\u2019\nstarts off with what sounds like some\ntrippy, spaced-out tablas gurgling under buzz-saw synths before a Todd\nRundgren sample informs us that a\npair of headphones \u201care really gonna\nhelp you\u201d. It\u2019s sage advice because what\nfollows sounds like a recording studio\nerupting into the stratosphere with the\nmost shit-crazy, galvanising sound effects I\u2019ve heard since I saw Justice live.\nThis is a boldness that is refreshing\nfor a band with such a geeky-cool disposition and when Taylor\u2019s monotone\nannounces \u201cSir, I have a good mind to\ntake you outside\u201d on the funky and methodical \u2018Hold On\u2019, he actually sounds\nlike he means it. The lyrics of \u2018The\nWarning\u2019s title track just sound like\nempty threats in comparison.\n\u2018Made In The Dark\u2019, however, retains the band\u2019s sense of humour. From\nequating love to getting beaten up by\nchair-bashing wrestlers in the cleverly\ntitled \u2018Wrestlers\u2019, to name-checking the\nMacarena in \u2018One Pure Thought\u2019 and\nGoddard\u2019s tongue-in-cheek delivery\nof \u201cTime-delay! Bend-away!\u201d in \u2018Bendable Poseable\u2019, there\u2019s a gleefully manic\napproach to the album which extends\ndown to the anything-goes arrange-ments. Time-signatures are messed\naround with, elements bounce in and\nare dropped again, melodies wobble\nand implode, and it\u2019s almost like they\nSingle Review\nSingle released on 18th February\nThe lead single \u2018A&E\u2019 taken from their\nSingle Reviews\nLook for \u2018Seventh Tree\u2019 to hit\nstores February 25th, \u2018A&E\u2019\nreleased 11th February\nNick Cave\nDig Lazarus Dig\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2729\nThe Metros\nEducation Pt. 2\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2729\u2729\nOne Night Only\nJust For Tonight\n\u2605\u2729\u2729\u2729\u2729\nGoldfrapp\nA&E\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2729\u2729\n\n"

    "content": "film.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n26 felix Friday 15 February 2008\nFilm\nFilm Editor \u2013 Alex Casey\nBlood, sweat, tears and oil\nDuring the London Film Festival in\nOctober, whilst promoting his latest\nfilm Into The Wild, Sean Penn was\nasked how it felt to be greatest actor of\nhis generation. His response? \u201cWell, I\nthink we all know that\u2019s not true, you\u2019ve\njust got to look at Daniel Day Lewis to\nsee that.\u201d As endorsements go, this one\nisn\u2019t to be taken lightly.\nFrom the point of view of Paul Thomas Anderson however, the coup of\ngetting the notoriously work-shy Lewis\nonto the screen at all must have been\nslightly tainted by the fact that the film\nhas been snatched right out from under the director\u2019s nose. That is at least\nwhat the hype would have you believe,\nbut the good news for Anderson is\nthat Blood is far more than a one-trick\npony.\nBlood is a 21st century Citizen Kane,\nmade for a new generation who don\u2019t\nunderstand the appeal of the original.\nCharting the rise of Lewis\u2019 oil baron,\nDaniel Plainview, it seems to draw numerous parallels with Welles\u2019 Kane but\nwith a modern-day edge. A new angle\nof religious opposition is present, with\nopposition to Plainview\u2019s takeover of\na small Texas community built on an\nFilm Felix takes a look at the latest from Paul Thomas Anderson to gauge the Daniel\nDay Lewis hype, but finds much more \u2013 There Will Be Blood strikes cinematic\nAlex Casey\nN\never in recent memo-ry, has public opinion\ncaused me to lose faith\nin the nature of taste so\nmuch as it has this week.\nLast Sunday\u2019s BAFTA awards provided\nthe perfect talking point for the week,\nan opportunity that was seized upon to\ngripe and open the age-old questions\nof British bias, Keira\u2019s inadequacies\nand Jonathan Ross\u2019 pay-cheque, whilst\ncongratulations for the great Tilda\nSwinton and Marion Cotillard faded\ninto the background.\nStarting with the nature of bias \u2013\nwho cares? I don\u2019t remember the Spanish Goyas showering awards on The\nEnglish Patient, nor the Oscars introducing Almodovar\u2019s pictures to a Best\nPicture award. The best award of the\nnight is always Best British Film, yet\nthis again got overlooked as people\nscratched their heads and said \u201cBut if\nThis Is England won the British one,\nhow did Atonement win Best Film?\u201d. If\nanything, it just shows how arbitrary\nthis load of toss is. Also, if you think\nMarion Cotillard is somehow more\nBritish than Julie Christie and Knightley then you\u2019re not keeping up.\nAs for Keira, it\u2019s time to lay off. Not\nfire her, but stop criticising the poor\ngirl. Yeah, she\u2019s no Dame Dench, but\nshe\u2019s 22 and it\u2019s not her fault people keep on offering her great roles.\nWould you have turned down Pride\nand Prejudice or Atonement? Didn\u2019t\nthink so. She was nice enough on the\nred carpet as well, heaping praise on\nMarion Cotillard (before she won) and\nbeing very self-deprecating, so I doubt\nshe went home crying into her gown. It\nwas more a result of press hype making it seem like she was going to win\nany of these awards which caused the\nbacklash, poor girl.\nI\u2019m not going to waste valuable column space discussing Wossie\u2019s pay-cheque, but you get the picture. The\nother big surprise was the way people\nhave completely railed on Atonement. I\nwill by no means fight its corner, but its\nnot as hideously self-aware as people\nseem to be criticising it for. It would\ncertainly have been my second choice\nbehind Blood, although that says more\nabout the competition really.\nThe biggest surprise of the night \u2013\neven bigger than a French lady scooping Best Actress \u2013 has to have been\nthe pretty poor turnout though. Given\nall the buzz about the biggest BAFTAs yet, there\u2019s trouble on the horizon when Kate Hudson is called on\nto present and Kevin Spacey and Jeff\nGoldblum get to award Best Picture\ndespite clearly having seen zero of the\nfilms for competition. If only the writers\u2019 strike could have held out for a\ncouple more days...\nIt hasn\u2019t been a poor year for film at\nall, despite my initial leanings to that\nkind of judgement in the run up to\nawards season. Juno, The Diving Bell\nand the Butterfly and There Will Be\nBlood were all released on the same\nday last week (albeit only a London\nrelease for Blood) which makes for a\npretty interesting weekend. If you really want a rundown of the best of the\nyear though, wait for Felix Film\u2019s own\nawards. Coming soon.\noilfield coming from Eli Sunday (Paul\nDano), a preacher intent on using the\nmoney generated from the village\noil to develop his parish, leading to a\nsimmering dynamic that underscores\nPlainview\u2019s otherwise unstoppable\nsuccess.\nAs Lewis has been commended from\nall corners for his outstanding lead per-formance, it would make more sense to\nhighlight the otherwise excellent talent\non show from Anderson and Dano,\nwho bring just as much to the table.\nAnderson fantastically evokes the feel,\nsmell and intrinsic wealth of oil, not to\nmention his superb creation of a figure\ninfinitely more terrifying in his resemblance to reality than Javier Bardem\u2019s\nkiller in No Country for Old Men. Dano\nseems to have grown up a lot since Little Miss Sunshine but his youth is still\nhis greatest foil in his struggle here,\nleading to a pretty unfair battle against\nthe might of Lewis.\nThe film itself is nothing short of\nepic. It\u2019s old Hollywood with new life\nand has been criminally overlooked by\ncritics simply falling over themselves to\npraise Lewis. A beautifully brutal story,\nmany will see this remembered as a\ngreat injustice if it walks away without\na Best Picture Oscar. It may not be the\nmost interesting film of the year, but\nit\u2019s certainly the best constructed of\nthose in the running. At least it would\nhave won 50 years ago.\nAlex Casey\nFilm Editor\nJumper \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u272b\nDirector: Doug Liman\nWriter: Doug Liman\nCast: Hayden Christiansen\nSamuel L. Jackson\nJamie Bell\nGiven the ability that Doug Liman had\nfor transforming Mr. and Mrs. Smith\nfrom the crap-sounding story it was,\ninto a pretty decent tongue-in-cheek\naction flick that seemed to win over\nmost people apart from Jennifer Aniston, it should come as little surprise\nthat he has managed to perform similar miracles with this teleportation ad-venture, Jumper.\nThe tendency for films about superpowers would generally seem to\ninvolve thinking up something cool\nthat the writer wished he could do at\nage 8 and then concocting ridiculous\ncoincidences in which that power can\nbe used. Jumper, however, surpasses\nthese expectations to provide a globe-trotting, supraliminal paced adventure\nthat proves much more exciting than\nrecently over-hyped releases such as I\nAm Legend and Cloverfield.\nThe story that sees Hayden Christensen\u2019s David learn he has the ability to teleport around the world, away\nfrom his typically strained home life,\nsoon heats up as he finds he is one of\na number of \u2018Jumpers\u2019 who are sadly\nhunted by a team of Paladins. Why\nis there always a downside to these\nthings?\nThe cast here are all very likeable but\nthe main draw is the action that maintains a level of excitement normally\nonly trailers can incite. Especially\nimpressive is the way that Liman has\nmanaged to conceive and execute the\nfinal continent-hopping battle-royale\nas well as persuade the Italians to let\nhim film inside the Colosseum.\nAbove all Jumper proves to be a great\nadvert for round-the-world trips. Sadly\nthe long-haul journey will do little to\nrecreate the exhilaration seen here.\nDaniel Day Lewis toking on a bifta\nThere Will Be Blood \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u272b\nDirector: Paul Thomas\nAnderson\nWriter: Paul Thomas\nAnderson\nCast: Daniel Day Lewis\nPaul Dano\nButterfly soars above the rest Liman makes Jumper a Joy\nThe Diving Bell \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u272b\nand the Butterfly\nDirector: Julian Schnabel\nWriter: Ronald Harwood\nCast: Mathieu Amalric\nEmmanuelle Seigner\nA memoir about quadriplegia isn\u2019t\nexactly light subject matter, so Diving\nBell isn\u2019t a story for everyone. However, Julian Schnabel\u2019s vision of a true-life\nwriter coming to terms with paralysis\nis much more than just another lachrymose weepy, successfully managing to\nblend the simple pleasures of life with\nthe horror of having them taken away.\nFormer Elle editor, Jean-Dominique\nBauby, suffered a crippling stroke in\n1996, writing his book of the same\nname by communicating his words to\na scribe via blinks. A tragic story, but\nnot one that transfers easily to screen.\nIt is only because of the beautiful direction here that the film works at all,\nand Schnabel\u2019s inclusion of random\nbut beautiful imagery \u2013 a collapsing\nice-sheet, an insect on a flower \u2013 to\ncapture the breadth of Bauby\u2019s imagination is a refreshing reminder of the\nbeauty of life juxtaposed against the\nhorror of illness.\nWhat makes Diving Bell stand out\nmost against other \u201csick flicks\u201d is its\nhumour. Bauby\u2019s internal monologue\nis full of sharp wit that shows extreme\nresilience in the face of adversity, and\nMathieu Amalric conveys great pathos\nthrough his singular expression. In one\nscene, a group of workmen fitting his\nphone mock his condition and cause\nhis nurse to retaliate while he imply\nthinks to himself \u201cHenriette, you have\nno sense of humour\u201d. Bliss.\nAs though to console a petrified audience from the thought of paralysis,\nthe emphasis is put on the rarity of\nthe condition. No matter how rare it is\nthough, it would be harder to find another film as respectful, touching and\nlife-affirming. That is Schnabel\u2019s tal-ent, and a testament to Bauby\u2019s book.\n\n"
