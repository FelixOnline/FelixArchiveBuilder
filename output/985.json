    "content": "2 News\nNational Science Week\nBY LYNN BRAVEY\n\"Science is fun!\" is the message\nbeing promoted by Science\nMinister William Waldegrave in a new Government campaign. The\ncampaign is designed to increase\npublic awareness on science,\nengineering and technology with\nthe primary aim to encourage more\nchildren to participate in science-based activities at school.\nOne of the main public\ninitiatives for this year is the\nNational Week of Science,\nEngineering and Technology,\ncalled Set 7, which begins on 18th March 1994. Events are being held\nnationwide and according to\nMr.Waldegrave the week is\ntargeting \"teachers, media, scientists, engineers and above all young\npeople\". Over 250 events have\nalready been planned with a wide\nrange of activities taking place such\nas talks, exhibitions, 'hands on'\ndisplays and the Science Museum\nare holding asleep over. Commenting on the huge\ninterest in the National Science\nWeek, Mr. Waldegrave said:\n\"Everyone will have the opportunity to see something of the\nexcitement and importance of\nWilliam Waldegrave, Science Minister\nscience, engineering and technology during the week.\nThe Set 7 programme will show\nhow vital science, engineering and\ntechnology is to our culture and\neconomy.\nThe campaign follows national\nconcern over school children\ndropping science subjects in\npreference to the Arts.\nAppeal For Witnesses Police are appealing for\nwitnesses to help find a group of six to nine men who\nsubjected a21 year old\nwoman to a serious sex\nassault in a Watford night\nclub in the early hours of 29th December 1993.\nThe offence took place at\nabout 2am during a Bhangra\nevent at Kudos Nightclub in\nThe Parade, Watford. Tickets\nfor this event were sold at\nuniversities around the\ncountry and in particular in\nLondon, Coventry, Reading,\nBirmingham and Leicester.\nPolice at Watford Central\nPolice Station are appealing\nfor information which will\nlead to the identification of\nthose involved.\nAnyone with information\nshould contact the incident\nroom at Watford Central\nPolice Station on 0923\n244444 or Crimestoppers on\n0800 555111.\nWANTED!\nReviewers Photographers News Reporters Feature Writers Illustrators Drop in to the Felix Office,\nGround Floor, Union Building to\nfind out more\nGETSET!\nBY LYNN BRAVEY\n340 thirteen year old girls are set to\ndescend upon Imperial College as\npart of National Science Week. The\nevent, entitled GET SET( Girls\nEntering Tomorrow's Science,\nEngineering and Technology), is a residential experience for girls\ntaking place on the 21st and 22nd March.\nDuring the two days they will be\ngiven a series of science challenges\nsupported by female mentors who\nare either scientists and engineers.\nThe projects have been designed\nby CREST (Creativity in Science\nand Technology) in conjunction\nwith Johnny Ball, the popular\nchildren's television presenter of\nscience and technology programmes who has been asked to\nattend the event.\nResearch has shown that year 9\n(13 year olds) is a critical time since\nit is when girls are most likely to\nlose interest in the physical\nsciences.\nGETSET aims to change this.\nSchools Liaison Officer, Melanie\nThody, said the event would be\n\"fun and exciting with activities\ntaking place largely in the Great\nHall\". The event should also attract\na good positive image for Imperial\nCollege which already has a world\nfamous reputation for its work in\nscience, technology, engineering\nand medicine along with its\ndisproportionate number of women\nstudents.\nImperial College is also\ninvolved in the BAYS( British\nAssociation of Young Scientists)\ndays. These days will have a packed\nprogramme of events including\ndisplays, exhibitions and presentations. It is hoped that Science\nMinister, William Waldegrave, will\nbe present to open the event, though\ncurrently the organising committee\nare still in the planning stages.\nDeadline for submission of letters is 6pm, Monday\n\n"

    "content": "18 Opinion\nEditorial\nDoes anyone seriously make new year resolutions any more? I gave up years ago because I could never keep them. No matter how hard I tried, things like keeping my room tidy or doing\nall my homework before I sat down and watched\nTV never lasted more than a week or two. There\nmust be some people out there who make new\nyear resolutions and actually stick to them for\nthe whole year. Surely we can't all be that weak-willed?! I 've yet to come across anyone who\nhas, though.\nSo why do we make such a big deal about\nmaking resolutions? We make them all the time.\nStarting anything new means we try to do it the\nbest we can or at least a bit better than before. I can remember every time I started a new\nexercise book at school, I would always vow to\nkeep my writing neat all the way through. But\nthe further I got through the book the worse the\nwriting it got. Every now and again it would\nbecome neater again, but it never lasted.\nArts Magazine\nEditor Wanted\nDear Beccy,\nEvery year, Phoenix (the Arts magazine of\nICU) is published and an editor is elected to\nproduce it at the start of this term. The job\ninvolves editing any suitable material (stories,\npictures, photographs etc) by the students of IC,\nputting it together into a magazine and getting it\nprinted (ICU provides a budget).\nIf this appeals to you, sign your name on the\npapers opposite the Union Office and get a proposer and five second ers to do the same, then\nturn up to the Publications Board meeting on\nFriday 21st January at 6.08pm in the Brown\nCommittee Room (top floor of the Union\nbuilding) for the elections.\nIf you want to know more, pop into IC Radio\nand talk to Greg lies or see Beccy Land in the\nFelix Office.\nThe Publications Board Members\nCredits\nPrinter: Photography:\nAndy Thompson Diana Harrison\nTypesetter: Books:\nRose Atkins Juliette Decock\nBusiness Manager: Music:\nSimon Govier Jon Jordan\nAdvertising Manager: Arts:\nSteve Newhouse Marcus Alexander\nScanned Graphics: Cinema:\nSam Michel Joe McFadden\nI 've tried to change things at other times, like\nat the start of a new college year or a new term\nor a new lecture course (back to the neat writing\nagain), but I 've failed every time. My problem\nsheets would never get done and my lab reports\nwould be left to the last possible moment. I always have such good intentions to start off\nwith, but other things are more tempting and\nthey become even more so the more important\nthe work is. I 've lost count of the number of\ntimes I 've tidied my room or done the washing\nup instead of revising for an exam and they are\nalways things I would avoid doing like the\nplague under normal circumstances.\nThat was sort of how I got so heavily\ninvolved in Felix. I don't mean that I would\nnormally have avoided the Felix Office, but I did\nspend a large amount of time there when I should have been studying. But Felix had much\nmore appeal than Quantum Mechanics or\nParticle Physics, surprisingly enough.\nSee Sting In\nConcert For\nFree Tonight\nDear Beccy,\nHappy New Year!!!\nIn case you thought that Rag dies a death\nafter Christmas we would like to an ounce this\nweek's events:\nWe have a collection at the Royal Albert\nHall on Friday night (tonight) at the Sting\nconcert and collectors will get in to see the show\nfor free!!\nAnyone interested should come to the Rag\nmeeting in the Union Lounge at 1pm today.\nMore great Rag events will be in next week's issue of Felix.\nLove from Rag\nTheatre: Layout & Proofing:\nRekha Nayak Kin Wei Lee\nKin Wei Lee\nPuzzles:\nNews: Penguin\nAndrew Tseng (Ed) Sphinx\nJoe McFadden\nLynn Bravey Thanks to everyone who\nMichael Ingram collated the final issue\nMark Simmons last term. I made a note\nof your names but Vve\nFeatures: temporarily misplaced\nOwain Bennallack (Ed) the bit of paper. I 'll try\nKin Wei Lee to find it for next week.\nI got so used to spending so much time in\nFelix that it was almost impossible to break the\nhabit. But I did learn a lot about how the issues\nwere put together which has proved invaluable\nthis year. I also saw the mistakes that were made\nand hopefully I 've managed to avoid making the\nsame ones this year.\nWhen I started as Editor, I made some\nresolutions. I wanted to make Felix better than\nbefore, not just the content, but the running of\nthe office as well. I found that some of the ideas\nI had were impractical, some I haven't got round\nto implementing yet and some I failed to keep.\nBut at least I can pass some of it on to whoever\nis voted in as next year's Editor.\nThat reminds me - elections for all the\nsabbatical posts (President, DP (Finance and\nServices), DP (Clubs and Societies) and Felix\nEd), as well as a few other Union posts, are\ntaking place later this term.

    "content": "16 Reviews\nCowboy\nJunkies\nPale Sun,\nCrescent Moon\nThey said that the title of their debut album,\n'Whites Off The Earth, Now!!' was a joke;\nwhite men could never sing the blues. Yet even\nthen the Cowboy Junkies updated and twisted\nsongs from delta bluesmen like John Lee\nHooker for a1986 audience. And despite the\nmore traditional country-folk road they've travelled since, the crossroads at midnight have\nalways exerted a fatal pull. Now, four albums\nlater, the Junkies get to play their own games.\nInitially it appears as if little has changed.\nMargo Timmins' voice still strips the bone and\nMichael Timmins' lyrics remain polished as he\nwrites standing in either gender's footsteps. But,\nas a whole, there's more range in the content,\nmore emotional variation. It's a hard listen at\nfirst, but in time, it could be their classic.\nThe early triptych of love warms. That 'Ring\nOn The Sill' is about the joys of marriage rather\nthan D.I.V.O.R.C.E. is as surprising as the fact\nAfrican\nHeadcharge\nIn Search of\nSmashamane Land\nthat it also embraces the fear of having nothing\nto give, of being empty for the one you love.\nThen the middling spreads. It feels the icy\nbreath of Robert Johnson's devils all over, memories become \"dead men making trouble\", things\nget dark.\nThe end hits a climax of unplayed bleakness.\nPenultimate, 'Hunted' comes from the fear of\nwomen alone in a city, alone in relationships,\nalone in a man's world. \"Do you know what it's like to be hunted?\" Maybe you do. Only the last\nline of the following track, 'Floorboard Blues',\nsave us from despair.\nStarting creepy as the figure described in his\npiggy fingers and belt cinched too tight, it's a specific hunting in progress. Whatever's under\nthose floorboards it could well be as blue and\ndecayed as hinted. Margo end whispering...\n\"it's af*** ed ole world, but this ole girl,\nwell she ain't giving in\"\n...and a harmonica wails out into the dusk.\nFrom the spirits of long dead negroes in the\nSouthern States to the still kicking hearts of four\nwhite North Americans, more than just music\npasses. If we lose that thread we may as well\nwish the whole shooting show into the vein of a junkie, getting salvation through the eye of a needle. (8)\nTintin\nReleased on RCA\nUnfolding lush jungle greenery, they weave layers and layers of tribal chanting and drumming.\nWith all this supported by a steady dub beat,\nthey add extra spatial dimension to your bed-room.\nThe key to African spirituality, their sensuous roots and primal sounds stretch forever,\nevoking vast lands on the way, and leaves you\nwith an earthy vibe that encircles your head. The\ncall-and-response form often found in blues is\nAnd what do we have for those greedy little fingers in this wonderful new year? Well not much\nat present, but alas ye not, there are good things\nin store just for you, so said the spider to the fat\nfly, anon, oh yes, anon...\n...first up after the sparkly tinsel: Terrorvision\nwith 'My House' {Total Vegas). Take it away\nCamille: \"Cheesy riffs, crunchy chords, an\namusing cover of Men At Work's 'Down Under'\nbut ultimately it's only trivial. And what is the\n'3D' stereoscopic cover supposed to be any-way?\" Well he's not too impressed.\nLet us hasten on to that sultry young Tasmin\nArcher. Her 'Shipbuilding e.p.'( EMi) is a tribute to that well loved pop ster Elvis Costello.\nUnfortunately his presence hangs too brightly\nover all as frankly it's rather difficult to cover\nCostello without, well, being the man himself. I suppose it's pleasantly tasteful an' all, smooth\nas a baby etc but only 'Deep, Dark, Truthful,\nMirror' really breaks out from the atmosphere\nof respect. As our own dear Inky was heard to\nmoan: \"She's massacred them songs. Now that\nRobert Wyatt he could handle himself...\" But\nthat's just Inky, addicted to his 'Teenage Kicks'\nand XTC.\nNow to a very different beast. She was on\nJools Holland over the hol s, so she can sing, but\ndoes it have to be Andrew Lloyd Webber? Of\ncourse I refer to Dina Carroll and the passing of\nwhat was for her, at least, 'The Perfect Year'\n(A&M). Penguin, renowned for his idol is ation of the lady, said, and I quote: \"Stunning voice\nand her album was the best of 1993. I was sceptical about this song at first but it grew on me\nand is now a firm favourite.\"\nNot content with that, the birdman continued\non a cinematic theme to review the title song\nfrom 'The Three Musketeers', 'All For Love'\n(A&M), sung by that triple bill of stardom: Bryan\nAdams, Rod Stewart and Sting. \"Although early\nreviews of the film are not good, this strong ballad has the potential of soaring to the heights of\n'Everything I Do', hopefully for not as long.\"\nIt's surely a bad sign that Adams, Kamen and\nLange, writers of 'Everything...' also wrote this\none. Seems like we could end up wishing for the\nnext Meatbread single.\nAnd so dear reader we must end. Suffice to\nsay next week we will have the likes of Kristin\nHersh, Drugstore and Therapy? to warm the\ncockles of your han dies. Ahh. Tintin\npresent here, mimicking the in flex ions of speech\nand laying out the complexities of the African\nlanguages in one of the richest of poly rhythmic cacophonies. An amorphous album, incorporating the occasional jazzy uplift, they make you\nwant to drop everything and run. Meanwhile,\nthough, African Headcharge will continue their\nsearch for the spiritual El Dorado. (8)\nCamille\nA bear, however hard he tries, grows tubby without exercise..\n\n"

    "content": "Reviews\n11\nAll\nMorse's Greatest Mystery\n(and other stories)\nby Colin Dexter\nI wouldn't class myself as much of a reader nor-m ally, but when the chance came to review the\nlatest book by Colin Dexter, the author of the\nInspector Morse stories, I jumped at it. It is a collection of ten short stories, five involving\nMorse and Lewis, and five others.\nThe thing that sets Dexter's work apart from\nthe rest of the market is not only the high level\nof readability, with his simple yet captivating\nstyle, but that each story has its own cunning\ntwists in much the same way as those of\nGeoffery Archer's' A Twist in the Tail'. The\ntales are rivetting and the character is at ions within them deep enough to make them absorbing,\nbut not too deep as to retract from the free flowing style of each piece.\nIn those stories involving Morse and Lewis,\nit is hard to tear your mind from Thaw and\nWhately in the TV series, which in truth does\nmuch for Central TV's adaptation of the original\nnovels. Often you still can't quite figure what\nhas been happening by the end of a story, but the\nfact that it almost seems to make sense is\nenough, especially when, as usual, the final outcome is quite different from anything that you\nthought at any other point during the story.\nOne of the stories that doesn't concern Morse\nis a short but rivetting Sherlock Holmes story. It\nis obvious from the piece that Dexter has great\nrespect for Arthur 'Conan' Doyle as the style he\nhas used within the story so closely matches that\nof Doyle, that apart from the subtle plot twists, it\ncould have been written by the great literati st himself.\nI thought that the other short stories wouldn't grip me as much, not being used to the characters, but again I was pleasantly surprised.\nThis book is highly recommended to anyone\nwho enjoys a good think during a book to catch\nthe twist before it happens. The style is great and\nthe book highly enjoyable.\nLittle Blue\nPublished by: MacMillan\nPrice: \u00a314.99\nAccomplice of\nLove\nby Titia Sutherland\nAccomplice Of Love, compared to other books\nI 've read, is worth every penny.\nThe purchase of a painting sparks off a chain\nof events culminating in an odd love triangle\ninvolving art dealer Leo, the painter and his\nwife and when tragedy strikes Leo's life, it\naffects all those around him.\nAll the action takes place over one weekend\nduring which the characters' tolerances for\nwhiskey outdo that of any student.\nThe storyline is quite credible and the characters are interesting and well-drawn, giving a tale that is quite difficult to put down once\nbegun.\nBrought to a timely and fitting end, when the\npainter's revenge becomes his salvation, the\nreader is left satisfied and most likely a little\nthoughtful. Not a heavyweight or classic novel\nby any means, but certainly good holiday read-ing.\nBeachball\nPublished by: Black Swan\nPrice: \u00a35.99\nThe Union Advice office provides free\nconfidential advice to all Imperial College\nstudents on a wide range of issues.

    "content": "Clubs and Societies 5\nSubterranean Campsite Blues\nThree Imperial men in a soggy sleeping bag and porridge shocker!\nAnd so it came down to weight...or rather lack of\nit. The plan - devised by the largest and heaviest\nmember of the club - was to spend the night at\nan underground camp in a pleasant cave in the\nFrench Vercors.\n\"The volunteers for this experience will be\nthe first members of IC Caving Club to complete\nsuch an exercise and in doing so will command\nthe awe and respect of the rest of the club,\" said\nJim, followed by a chorus of \"Crap!\",\n\"Bullsh*t!!\"... etc. This method of recruiting\nvolunteers was clearly not going to succeed. So\nthe selection reverted to choosing those who'd suffer most in the humid 4-8\u00b0C temperatures of\nthese caves. I was chosen for my lack of body\nfat, Richard Moon for the same reason and Mark\nEvans was picked because he'd lived in Hong\nKong all year and so he wouldn't be accustomed\nto the cold.\nAll three of us had ventured down the Gour\nFumant on the first day of the summer tour and\nhad left it rigged since then. The plan was to\ntake our sleeping gear and dump it at the camp,\nat the foot of the fourth pitch - sufficiently far\ninto the cave to dispel any ideas of an escape to\nthe comfort and delights of the Girl Guide Camp\nsituated just three miles down the road from the\ncave entrance. Once we had decided on the\nunderground campsite, we were to venture\nthrough a meandering passage and enter, via a series of short climbs, The Chinese Dragon - a most impressive chamber filled with turquoise\npools and excellent formations.\nEach of us had one tackle bag in which to\ncarry our gear, which\nwas typically one\nKarrimat, one very thin\nsleeping bag, one spare\nfurry suit, socks and\na survival bag (the\nthick polythene type).\nBetween the three of us\nwe carried two stoves:\na Trangia and an\nunknown brand of\nunknown quality (both\nwere fuelled by meth s). The food was de-hydrated: three dried\nmeals and enough\nporridge to feed an\narmy.\nApproaching 10pm on the chosen evening,\nDave Mountain completed the drive to the\ncave in record time.\nThen, with the tail\nlights of the van\ndisappearing into the gloom of dusk and the\nthought of the rest of the team becoming drunk\nback at the campsite, we got into our kit. We\nreached the entrance to the Gour Fumant just as\nthe stars began to shine in the clear night sky.\nThis was my third venture into this cave in as\nmany days and, as always, confidence builds\nwith acquaintance of one's surroundings. So\nmuch so that the fourth pitch was nearly\ndescended without using any rope. It was at the\nfoot of this pitch that we left our sleeping gear.\nTo reach the meander\nthat led to the Chinese\nDragon we descended a further pitch. At the\nbottom of this we met\nour friendly double\nrig gers: two men and a woman, quite local\n(from about 50 miles\naway) who had come\ndown for the evening.\nAll had to go to work\nthe next day and since\nit was now approaching\nmidnight, the prospect\nof a night at our\nunderground camp\nseemed not to appeal to\nthem. By the time we\nreappeared from the\nmeander they were\ngone. We had the cave\nto ourselves.\nof collisions ensued which left us in a pile\nuncomfortably close to the 16m final pitch we'd de-rigged earlier.\nThe hours passed slowly. Sleep, after the first\nhour, proved elusive. While my under suit was\nmerely damp, the survival bag proved to be such\na barrier to moisture\nthat the condensation\nthat had formed now\nsoaked my thin sleeping bag, rendering it\nalmost useless. By 6amI'd had enough and\ndecided to light a candle.\n\"Are you wet?\"\nasked Mark, making it\nperfectly clear that he\ntoo had suffered an\nuncomfortable night in\na wet sleeping bag.\nEven with a dry furry\nsuit, the body produced\nenough moisture to\nsoak a sleeping bag\nwithin a polythene one.\nRichard, on the other\nhand, had had a comfortably dry night\nGOV* FUMANT\nFood was the first priority and was prepared\nin no time. The shepherd's pie was okay, the\nchilli cone carne passable, but, with too much\nwater added, the beef bourg in on had to be\nthrown away. It wasn't even a substitute for\nsoup. Mark's tiny\nstove worked well but\ntook 2-3 minutes to\nwarm up. After a brew\nit was time to find\nsomewhere to sleep.\nUnfortunately there\nwas no flat ground on\nthe boulder strewn\nfloor, so we made do\nwith a bedding plane\nleading off the chamber via a rift in the\nceiling. Once in a horizontal position\nthere was barely twelve\ninches between one's nose and the roof, so\nmovement was severely hampered.\n\"What happens if I awake with aston ker?\", Mark asked\npoignantly, \"I could be\nstuck here indefinitely.\" \"Don't flatter yourself,\" came the reply\nin unison.\nOnce inside both sleeping bag and survival\nbag, it was impossibly difficult to stop slipping\ndown the slope and, as I was at the top, a series\nhaving removed his survival bag almost\nimmediately. The lesson was clear. Find\nsomewhere dry to bi vi or, if that is impossible,\nuse a breathable bi vi bag.\nThroughout the night, the thought of warm\nporridge was what kept me going. This porridge\nwas to be one of James Evans' inventions. The\noats, dried milk and sugar were all mixed in the\ncorrect proportions in the same bag and\ninstructions, simple enough even for cooks down\na cave were inscribed on a sticky label on the\nside: \"Add five cups of water,\" it said, \"then\nheat.\" We did so, but unfortunately didn't take\ninto account the expanding nature of the stuff as\nit soaked up the water. With too much to eat, we\ntried to dispose of the stuff in the trickle that was\na stream, but it soon blocked the flow and was of\nsuch consistency that I'm sure it will still be\nsomewhere in that cave to this day.\nNone of us had previously noted the laxative\neffect of a good bowl of porridge, but all were\nsuffering now with no toilet roll (but who needs\nthat anyway?) and a great desire to leave the\ncave as we'd found it, at least until we reached\nthe woods by the entrance.\nAs we lay in the sun absorbing the warmth,\nthe van arrived; its occupants were sporting a fair hangover, which is a normal state of affairs\nat 10am, whether in Yorkshire, Derbyshire, the\nMendips or the Vercors. Unless, of course,\nyou'd spent the night underground.\nIain McKenna\n1\nW j \u00bb\n4 m*m mm ji mm m So Tms is v my rr'su uedA BEDDJNG PLANE..\n\n"

    "content": "Reviews 15\nImagine You Are . . .\nImagine you are visiting an art gallery. You\nshuffle amongst the looming concrete abutments\nand staircases of the complex, weighed down by\na leaden autumn sky and the alienating power of\nthe architecture. You step through the doorway,\nlooking for the paintings, but you do not find\nthem. Instead you experience an overpowering\nsense of deja vu. Everywhere you look the\nimages seem strangely familiar, you've seen\nthem before somewhere. No, not somewhere,\nbut everywhere...\nJulian Opie's art is modern in the truest, most\nexciting sense of the word. He draws his inspiration from familiar topics: motorways, video\ngames, architecture. He doesn't paint, sculpt or\ndraw, but all three, and more. Everything\nbecomes part of his work, even the viewer. It\ndemands to be 'used, abused, and taken apart'.\nHe paints motorways with the sterilised purity of\na computer, then recreates them on the screen\nof a PC in the corner. He\nbuilds concrete racetracks which sprawl\nacross the floor, then\ninstructs you to 'Imagine\nyou are driving'. He\ncovers the walls with\ngiant images of arcade\ngame mazes and builds\nmodel houses and cas-t les. On the terrace you\nstep over his fortified\nwalls, dwarfed by the\nvastness of the South\nBank centre. A series of coloured boxes stand\ntogether and the entire view merges with it to\nbecome part of the work. His titles either edify\nor instruct - 'The average speed of a car in\nLondon is slower than\nthat of equestrian traffic\nat the turn of the cent u ry' reminds you of the\ncongestion which clots\nthe city's roads but is\nseemingly unrelated to\nthe sculpture. 'Imagine\nyou can order these'\ninvites you to play with\nthe work, rearrange it to\nyour own desires. He\nhas done so himself, and\nhas recreated the images on canvas with obsessive purity.\nOpie's work is there for YOU, and it\ndemands your participation. Don't go to look,\nbut go to toy with it, to mess about with your\nown sense of reality. It's not to be taken seriously (spot the air conditioning vents) but to be\ntaken to pieces. Experience the irony, simulate\nthe simulation and above all, take part - you'll\nnever see a road in the same way again.\nJulian Opie is showing at the Hayward, along\nwith Roger 'looks like it was painted by a five\nyear old' Hilton. See them both and remember\none.\nMA\nHayward Gallery, South Bank Cnetre, SE1. 071\n928 3144. Tube: Waterloo. Open 10am6 pm. Cones \u00a33.50.\nTo See The Unseen\nOK, so I have to admit I was sceptical. In the\npast, 'video art' has always implied the tedious\nfilms that used to be thrown up late at night on\nChannel Four before it became popular, the sort\nof film where 'home video quality' is equated\nwith arty ness. With this in mind, I was expecting\nBill Viola's 'Unseen Images' at the Whitechapel\nGallery to be pretty disappointing (In fact I'd pretty much written my review before I arrived,\nbut being a smug self satisfied bastard I would\ndo that). Imagine my shock when I arrived, and\nwitnessed the horror within.\nI knew something was up the moment I entered the door. The people going in were\nlaughing, joking. Those who left drifted past like\npale, deathly ghosts. The whole gallery has been\nfilled with a dark, throbbing menace. Machinery\nreminiscent of the film 'Brazil' protrudes from\nwalls or hangs in omniscient clusters from the\nceiling. Viola has combined the media of film\nwith space, sound and hulking pieces of mechanical hardware to create four dimensional sculptures of a horrifying intensity. In 'Slowly\nRevolving Narrative', two projectors shine from\nopposite ends of the chamber towards a giant\ncentral screen, which rotates slowly to stretch\nand distort each projector's image in turn. The\nother side is mirrored to reflect the viewers, their\nfaces scarred by the pixel late d projector light.\nAbove a deep rumble of under sound a voice\nchants endlessly, 'the one who educates...the one\nwho packages...'\nIn 'Threshold' you witness the intense brightness of a scrolling display which brings the latest\nnews items direct from Reuters. Through the\ndoor in the centre and disorientation hits - the\nbrightness of the information outside has blinded\nyou, and the darkness of the passage is cl austro phobic. If you walk on, instant calmness overtakes as you enter a darkened room where each\nwall shows the image of a sleeping person, the\nsound of snoring permeating the room.\nSomehow, Viola has managed to capture the\nmoment of falling asleep in the threshold. Other\ndisplays are more tranquil. By far the most beautiful is 'Heaven and Earth', in which two screens\nface each other intimately closely, one depicting\nbirth and the other death. Each screen is reflected in the other, the two layers floating in space.\nUnfortunately, Viola's most touted piece,\n'Nantes Triptytch', is disappointing. The theme\nof birth and death which is explored so intensely\nin 'Heaven and Earth' here just seems tacky and\nobvious. Another room worth missing shows\nsome of Viola's early films, which really are of\nthe Channel 4 type. When Viola made these\nfilms he somehow forgot to include a plot, and\nten minutes of random imagery is just not worth\nsitting down for. A few arty p seu ds stayed for\nthe entire showing, either to pretend that they\nenjoy it or because they were waiting for something to happen (it didn't, not while I was there\nat least).\nSo for those who want to spend an afternoon\nwith some of the more exciting modern art, or\njust those into 'weird shit, man', the Whitechapel gallery is well worth a trip out to the East\nEnd.\nMA\nBill Viola - Unseen Images. Until 13th Feb.\nWhitechapel Art Gallery, Whitechapel High\nStreet, El. 071 377 0107. Tube: Aldgate East.\nOpen Tue-Sun ll am Spm. Admission FREE!\nKevin Costner plays a bad die!

    "content": "14 Reviews\nMacbeth\nWeirding sisters ascend the misty stage. Three\nhags, starting a tale of Doom. They call Macbeth\nto be Thane of Cawdor and King thereafter.\nQuickly proved true on the first count, what\nabout the way to Royalty? The scene is set of an\ninfamous tale. How a man is driven by his ambi-tion, by circumstance, by his wife, surely by the\nsupernatural powers themselves, to commit mur-der, gory ever increasing murder. Kill the King,\nkill your best friend, dash out the brains of\nbabies, turn all Scotland red. So what can the\nRSC, with the principles of Derek Jacobi and\nCheryl Campbell, bring out of the play in 1993,\na year full of Bosnian genocide and decomposing morals?\nThe leads are conservative, even pedestrian,\nduring the first half and only come alive during\nthe downwards slope of the second. Jacobi is\nsolid, rather an awful way to play Macbeth.\nFire, hell and damnation crouch at his feet and\nthey are not polite. He should be a sane man,\nlosing but fighting for his morality, not an\nobserver. Cheryl Campbell frankly struggles as\nLady Macbeth. Although her character is problematic in that she appears to be of steel only to\ncollapse in vigour towards suicide, there's nothing of either world on show.\nTo shine brighter, Malcolm (Jason Durr) and\nMacduff (Michael Siberry) play the most heartfelt scene after the interval. Unfortunately this is\nusually called 'the boring scene'. Christopher\nRavenscroft (Banquo) is also a cut above even as\nLady Macbeth wanders lonely as a cloud. Tut. tut, looks like she could get some spots (of rain)\na ghost. Its appearing is the strongest part of the\nplay and also show something of how the direction could have been. This subplot revolves\naround a bumbling ly jolly Duncan, who gets cast\nas Christ in a last supper, eating with his Judas.\nThis is continued as Macbeth has twelve guests\nfor the ghost banquet. The twist comes as the\nwitches use the same table and vest ib les for a pseudo black mass which Macbeth has to\nreceive to get his final three visions. OK, it's subtle but it has so much rich symbolism which\ncould be infused throughout. But it just remains\na clever subplot from a director who we already\nknow is clever.\nTo end, in the dying minutes Macduff has\nMacbeth at his mercy, the final blow is to be\nlaid, but Macbeth pushes himself onto the point\nof the sword. It's the kind of suicide a man fighting for this life would not even want to live for.\nMacbeth is so far dyed in blood he must go on.\nThe implication of suicide is only workable if\nthe entire play points towards it. That it doesn't damns the whole.\nMaybe this is a play to introduce you to\nMacbeth, but for an understanding of its textual\nconsistency or an idea of what it has to say at the\nstart of 1994, look elsewhere.\nTintin\nRSC Barbican, Barbican, EC2. 071 638 8891.\nTube: Moorgate/Barbican. Standby \u00a38, \u00a36.50.\nStupid Cupid Buddy\nThis is one of the best shows I have seen in a long time. A fifties musical with singing, dancing and plenty of merriment. Stupid Cupid\ninvites you to step back into the twilight world\nof fifties cinema where the Hollywood dream\nbecomes reality; romance in the back row and\nmovie star worship.\nThis is the story of Sid, a cinema usher in his\nsearch for true love, and Frankie, a tough butch,\nout to get his girl, Cupid, back from the glitzy\nworld of Holly-wood.\nAction alternates between the Peckham cinema and the off-screen activities of the movie\nstars themselves in Hollywood. Moving, sensitive, humorous and high-spirited. May I recommend that, if you only see one piece of theatre\nin 1994, you make it this one. But, be quick, it\ncloses on January 16th. Well worth seeing\ntwice.\nRachel\nBatter sea Arts Centre, 176 Lavender Hill,\nSW11. 071 223 2223. Train: Clapham Junction.\nTue-Sat 8pm, Sun 6pm. \u00a37.50, \u00a36 cones, pay\nwhat you can on Tue. Until 16th Jan.\nLike any West End show in its '5th Fantastic\nYear' there must be something special that\nkeeps the appeal going. However, I was very\nambivalent as to my views on this by the end.\nThe first half, before the interval, mainly centres around the life story of Buddy Holly & The\nCrickets. It traces the guys from their early\nbeginnings, signing first to a Country and\nWestern label until disillusioned by being forced\nto make music that wasn't their own. The swift\nrise to stardom, their first gig at the Apollo in\nHarlem due to the country assuming that by their\nstyle they must be a black group. Up to this\npoint the music is in short snippets so as not to\nget you hacked off with the same tunes time and\nagain. It is smoothly done with suitably simplistic sets and easy to lose yourself in the era.\nThe second half in contrast is predominantly\ntaken over with a concert performance at a significant point in their career. Along the same\nlines as other musical plays such as 'Return To\nThe Forbidden Planet' there is a live feel with\ndancing encouraged in both the central aisles\nand front row. So if you're into that sort of exhibitionist participation take note when booking\nseats. I was quite happy at this point to be stuck\nin my safe seat in the middle of a row a few\nback from the front. However as the tempo\nincreased I found my feet tapping and wanting\nto participate, but of course I was now stuck in\nthe middle of an inaccessible row with no room\nbetween the seats for dancing.\nIf they're putting on a whole show of the calibre of the first half I'd quite happily sit for the\nentire performance. On the other hand if they're\ngoing to put on an amazing gig of the calibre of\nthe second half, then it is a crying shame that\nthey supplied seats at all. Lastly I must profess\nto being a fan of the music from that era and I believe that helped with my enjoyment consider-ably. So as a cautionary note, people who are\nnot bee-bop-a lula fans should maybe think\ntwice.\nBonnie (& Clyde)\nVictoria Palace. Victoria St, Wl.

But the sabbaticals\nwould be delighted if you decided to spend more\ntime making use of other ICU facilities - and not\nonly by propping up the bar!\nPersonal Transferable Skills\nIn a survey of employers a few years ago, to\nwhich over 80 responded, the following emerged\nas the main personal transferable skills most\nsought after in graduates:\n- Identify problems\n- Pose solutions\n- Work in teams\n- Communicate\n- Speech\n- Writing\n- Numerical skills\n- Adaptation to change\n- Creative thinking\n- Good appearance\n- Leadership skills\n- Selfmanagement\nLooking Good\nGood appearance may strike you as the odd one\nout. What it means is that you have taken the\ntrouble to make the most of yourself and dressed\nappropriately for the occasion - such as an inter-view.\nOther skills mentioned by employers include:\n- Planning and organising\n- Decision making\n- Motivation\n- Personal strength\n- Analytical reasoning\nPersonal strength is nothing to do with your\nphysical ability; it refers to self-confidence, realism and coping with pressure.\nTaking Part\nSo if these are the qualities that employers are\nseeking, how do you set out to acquire them?\nAlthough some abilities may be innate, many\nskills can be developed through practice and\nexperience. This is where you can benefit by\ntaking part in one or more of the many activities\norganised by ICU. This does not mean that you\nalways have to aim to be the president, chair or\ncaptain of the society or club; any position of\nresponsibility will help you to gain useful experience. And even just taking part will develop\nyour skills of working with people.\nKnowing Yourself\n\"I don't need a shrink\", I hear you say. Of\ncourse not! But it does help to understand what\nyou are good at, what you enjoy and what skills,\nabilities, interests and values you have because\nthese are the starting points for choosing a career. The Careers Service has work books and\na computer aided careers guidance system -PROSPECT (HE) - to enable you to match your\nprofile with those of a large number of different\noccupations. You can always arrange to see a Careers Adviser for a quick query between 1pm and 2pm or book a longer discussion. So you\nhave no excuse for saying that you haven'ta clue what you want to do next.\nSkills to Develop\nYour course should encourage you to develop\nmany of the important skills, such as analysing,\ncalculating, drawing, investigating, evaluating,\ndesigning and diagnosing.\nICU societies and clubs can also help you to\ndevelop some of the other important skills such\nas writing, editing, decision-making, planning,\nsynthesising ideas and lateral thinking.\nCommunication\nIf you can't communicate, you are at a severe\ndisadvantage in life. You really do need to be\nable to express yourself adequately, both in writing and in speech. Contributing to committee\nmeetings will give you the self-confidence to\nspeak up and to express your views in a group.\nMaking a presentation is another important skill.\nIn business and industry you may spend more\ntime communicating to people than in calculating equations, so practice now is well worth-while.\nStart Today\nSo make a New Year Resolution, start planning\ntoday how you are going to acquire a complete\neducation - before you have completed your\neducation.\nJohn Simpson\nDirector, IC Careers Service\nEnts Lounge1 pm28 th January(2 weeks from today)\nDeadline for motions: Friday 21st January\n(1 week from today)\niCU IMPERIAL COLLEGE UNION\n\n"

Since we are an IC\npublication and having had many IC and non-IC\nentries so far, we have decided that, in the event\nof a tie, any IC entries will take precedence.\nAlso, any members of FELiX staff are\nautomatically disqualified as they couldn't have\nfailed to hear our crossword team yelling phrases\nsuch as \"I need a clue for ...\" and \"Does ... have\none or two f's?\" towards the end of last term.\nAlthough we have already had many IC\nentries (by no means were all of them correct), to\nencourage a few more people to take part we are\nextending the deadline for completed solutions\nto:\n6pm on Monday 17th Jan '94\nComplete entries should be placed in the\nCompetition pigeonhole in the FELiX office\n(bottom left corner of the Union Building, Beit\nQuad), with a note of your name, department,\naddress and a contact telephone number.\nAt the end of the day, these rules are at the\ndiscretion of the judging panel which consists of:\nthe Designer, the Clues Editor and the FELiX\nEditor whose decisions are final. The interpretation of these conditions is also at the\ndiscretion of the judging panel.\nSo, if you have not tried it yet, there is still\ntime to attempt it this weekend; copies of the\nChristmas FELiX, 3D Crossword included, are\nstill available from the FELiX office.\nDon't forget the great prizes: 1st Prize worth\nover \u00a335! & 5 Runners Up Prizes worth over \u00a325\neach. Each prize consists of a top dictionary and\ntop crossword manuals.\nIn the box above is a full and final list of\nerrata. Don't worry if you've already handed in\nyour solutions, this list is just to correct a few\ninaccuracies and it will not count against you.\nSolutions and a list of winners will be printed\nin next week's issue of FELiX.\nLastly, look out for the next FELiX 3-D crossword. It will be a15 x15x15 and should\nappear in the Easter edition which will be\navailable in all departments on the last day of\nthis term.\nAlso, to help those of you who are not\ncompletely familiar with cryptic crosswords, we\nwill be running a weekly guide on how to go\nabout solving them in the weeks running up to\nthe Easter edition. So, keep an eye out for them.\nWe will still be running a weekly puzzle, either a crossword or an elimination, to keep you\noccupied in those Friday morning lectures.\nUntil Easter, happy puzzling.\nThe Munster Road Kitchen\nby Samin Ishtiaq\nThere were only five of use when we moved into\nthis Munster Road place. There was supposed to\nbe a sixth person. Or a non-person: this guy\nwasn't really part of our household (i.e., he\nwasn't an IC student) but used to live in a( separate) beds it right in the middle of our house\n(these landladies will do anything for more\nmoney, won't they?). Apparently he used to be a dustman but got made redundant (yep, even\nHammersmith and Fulham 'Quality Promise'\nCouncil are making people redundant) and\nbefore the academic year started told our\nlandlady that he would be moving out.\nWhich means that he wasn't there when the\nfive of us moved in. Which was a real pity -especially for Paul and Nils (okay, okay, and\nme) - 'cause we had this brilliant plan to kill\nhim.\nWe had nothing against him personally, you\nunderstand. I mean, it didn't really matter that he\nwas only a dustman. Or that he was unemployed.\nOr that he was white. No, no, there was much\nbetter reasons than that. Firstly, he was\noccupying a large room that could conveniently\nbe turned into a sitting room for us lot. How\ncivilised it would be, a sitting room [What, to\ntake tea in? How pon cy! Ed] and it would be\nan ideal place to put Nils' TV in as well. And\nsecondly Paul had these theories about the\nperfect murder. Could we pull it off?\nI would have thought not. Especially since\none of the ideas was to take him down to the\nlocal barbers (conveniently sited just opposite\nour house) in the dead of Sunday night and use a cut-throat razor to finish him off. After that we'd haul his body back and feed it to the dog. (Of\ncourse, one of the problems was that we didn't have a dog; in fact, our tenancy agreement\nspecifically ruled out pets, but anyway...)\nGetting rid of the tooth and hairs (theoretically\nconsidered to be the most difficult) would be\ndone by weighing them down and throwing the\nwhole bundle into the Thames (conveniently\nsited just a block or so away).\nI never actually thought we could have pulled\nit off, but went along with the whole idea\nanyway. Now we'll never know.\nCrossword competition deadline extended to Monday 6pm "

    "content": "News 3\nCollege Slams ICU President\nCollege rejects Imperial College Union's constitution as\nPresident misleads students\nBY MARK SIMMONS\nAND ANDREW TSENG\nA letter leaked to Felix has\nconfirmed fears that Andrew\nWensley, ICU President, has\nmisled students at Imperial.\nThe letter from Peter Mee, the\nCollege Registrar, to Mr Wensley\ndetails his neglect to present the\nICU constitution to Imperial\nCollege's Governing Body. Dated,\n22nd November, the letter fuels\nallegations of deceit by the ICU President.\nSources close to Mr Wensley\nare concerned that he did not see fit\nto discuss the letter with anyone.\nFurthermore, he neglected to\ninform students that the constitution would not be going before\nthe Governing Body. (It is a requirement that changes to the\nconstitution are approved by\nGoverning Body before it is put\ninto opera it ion.) When quizzed by\nFelix on his motives, Mr Wensley\nexcused himself, saying: \"I want to\nbe aware of the implications to\nmyself first, so that I can inform all\nstudent members of the imp li cations\".\nAfter the Union General\nMeeting ( U GM) in October,\nAndrew Wensley presented the\nU GM ratified constitution to Peter\nMee. Mr Wensley expected the\nconstitution to be approved at the\nnext Governing Body meeting on\n12th November. From the agenda it\nwould have been apparent from a week before the meeting that this\nwas not to be the case.\nInterviewed by Felix, Peter Mee\nexpressed regret at the way in\nwhich the ICU constitution has\nbeen handled. Mr Mee showed\nsome surprise that Mr Wensley had\nclaimed, in early December, that\nthe constitution had gone to the\nGoverning Body. He made it clear\nthat Mr Wensley would have\nknown this was not true. After two\nmonths of silence, Mr Wensley\npresented these problems to the\nExecutive Committee for the first\ntime in a meeting held yesterday\nevening.\nMr Mee went on to announce\nthat he had spoken to the Chairman\nof the Governing Body. As a result,\nthe Governing Body would accept\nthe constitution as a 'working\ndocument'. While nobody disagreed with the aims of the\nconstitution, he said that it could\nnot be considered complete.\nPeter Mee also suggested that\nstaff advice might have been wise.\nThe College is currently setting up\na committee to formulate a final\nconst it ui on in the light of the\ncurrent dilemma and the new\nGovernment legislation regarding\nstudent unions. The committee will\nconsist of the ICU President, the\nfour Constituent College Union\nPresidents and several staff\nmembers, including Mr Mee.\nDiscussing the changes and\npeople's reactions within the\nCollege Mr Mee regretfully said:\n\"One has to know from past\nexperience that of our 7,000\nstudents there's not more than a handful [who are concerned] about\nthe operation of [their] union.\"\nUnion Minibus in Hit and Run\nSome of the Union's fleet of minibuses earlier this week\nBY MICHAEL INGRAM\nInvestigations are being made into\nthe possibility of a Union minibus\nbeing involved in a 'hit and run'\nincident over the Christmas\nholiday.\nThe incident, which took place\nin the early hours of New Year's Day, resulted in one person being\nseriously injured.\nPolice in Kent who were called\nto the scene found a vehicle\nbearing the number plates of a minibus registered as belonging to\nImperial College Union.\nThe vehicle registration number\ncorresponds with that of a minibus\ninvolved in an accident over the\nsummer holiday {Felix 974) in\nwhich the only part of the minibus\nleft undamaged was apparently the\nfoot plate at the back.\nUnion Officials said it was\n'unlikely' that the minibus was\nrepairable and classed it as a write-off.\nAlthough the minibus was still\nregistered to ICU, Dave Goddard,\nDeputy President (Finance and\nServices) said that there was no\nrisk of liability to the Union\nregarding the accident.\nThe minibus has since been\nfound abandoned and burnt out and\nit is unclear at present if the vehicle\nwas in fact the minibus or whether\nthe number plates had been used on\na different vehicle. Police are\nconducting a detailed examination\nto determine if the vehicle is the\nUnion's minibus. The engine and\nchassis serial numbers have been\nsupplied for this purpose.\nDeadline for submission of articles is 6pm, Friday\n\n"

    "content": "Reviews 7\nA Perfect World: See that Kevin Costner? That's your dad, that is.\nA Perfect\nWorld\nStarring: Kevin Costner, Clint Eastwood, TJ\nLowther, Laura Dern\nDirector: Clint Eastwood\nProbably the best film to be released over the\nChristmas period was A Perfect World. It's a road movie set in 1963 Texas, following the\nrelationship between an escaped convict, Butch\nHaynes (Costner) and the boy, Philip (Lowther)\nhe takes hostage. It is directed by the now experienced hand of Clint Eastwood, who also stars\nas the Texas Ranger sent to catch Haynes. He's accompanied in this task by a young criminologist (Laura Dern).\nThe film's strongest point is the relationship\nbetween Butch and Philip. Philip, a fatherless\nJehovah's Witness who has been denied many of\nthe joys of life, strikes a chord in Butch who had\nalso been denied both a caring father and the\njoys of youth. As a result Butch becomes a father figure to his captive.\nEven if you're not a Costner fan you have to\nbe impressed with his performance in this film.\nPlaying the bad guy, you assume that the acting\nwill naturally be bad as it's so unlike his other\nroles, but Costner fits so easily into the role that\nMalice\nStarring: Alec Baldwin, Nicole Kidman\nDirector: Harold Becker\nThe director of Sea of Love is back with a new\nsuspense thriller, set in a town called Malice.\nAndy and Tracy Safian (Pullman and\nKidman) are a recently married couple. Andy is\na college dean while his wife works in the local\nhospital. Enter Dr Jed Hill (Baldwin), an arrogant, self-assured surgeon recently transferred to\nthe hospital, who just happens to be an old high\nschool buddy of Andy. Needing the money, the\ncouple reluctantly take him in as a lodger.\nThe plot apparently begins with the hunt for\na murderer who is praying on the female students at Andy's college; Andy is implicated\nwhen one of his own students is murdered. At\nfirst this seems to be an unoriginal and simplistic story, however a subplot complements an\neven more intriguing storyline where the relationship between the three can only lead to\nmoney, betrayal and deception.\nThis film is well worth seeing as it has many\nunexpected twists as the main plot gathers\nmomentum.\nKin\nit's no longer Kev, but Butch you're watching.\nWe learn more of Butch's unhappy youth, especially his hatred of child abusers, leading to\nsome scary moments later on when he witnesses\nsituations too close to home.\nIf the film has a down side it is the seemingly\ninconsequential roles of Eastwood and Dern.\nThey are mostly there to highlight the problems\nof punishing juvenile offenders. Eastwood's character, Red Garnett, was Butch's arresting\nofficer 20 years earlier, and decided that Butch\nwould benefit more from a jail spell than the\ncustody of his broken home. The decision\nWliSMBBI\nStarring: Kathleen Turner, Dennis Quaid\nDirector: Herbert Ross\nNew Orleans, the home of Jazz and Cajun\nChicken, makes a delightfully relaxed setting for\nthis new laid-back comedy by director Herbert\nRoss.\nThe story concerns the spies for the nineties,\nthe loving caring parents of a little baby, Mr\nand Mrs Blue (Dennis Quaid and Kathleen\nTurner). As the film starts, they are on maternity\nleave from the FBI but are soon convinced back\ninto work. Being good parents and not wanting\nto leave the baby, they naturally take her along.\nAlong with the main plot are the side characters consisting of the stupid cops sent to trail the\nBlues, and a street thug called Muerte (meaning\ndeath), who has it in for the Blues and is constantly trying to kill them. These characters are\nperhaps not as rich as the Blues but do much as\na sounding board for the Blues own characters.\nIn the end what makes the film enjoyable is\nthe whole relaxed nature of the piece, as with\nJeff Blue's casual smugness as far as the local\nlaw is concerned.\nAlthough it could have been a smash action\ncomedy, the relaxed direction taken makes it a proved bad with Butch becoming a career cri mi nal, a fact which adds a black irony to the chase.\nThis point is unfortunately underplayed; the pursuers merely provide the director with a break\nfrom the tale of Butch and Philip.\nThe real star of the film is TJ Lowther, who\nalmost upstages Costner and blows the socks off\nEastwood and Dern in their smaller roles. His\nrepertoire of expressions is endless and his\npuppy dog stare would melt even the toughest\nhearts. The ending is superbly emotional and\nguaranteed to bring a lump to the throat.\nSphen\ngood film to see if you're looking for something\nto do one afternoon.\nSphen\nUndercover Blues\nNext week: Kurt Russel in Tombstone\n\n"
