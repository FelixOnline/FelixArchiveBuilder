They will have a wider range of opportunities. They will also face\nproblems calling for new solutions. Today's children need the most imaginative and creative\nteaching. Teaching by men and women who are\namong the ablest of their generation... graduates\nwho are among the most outstanding of their\nyear. Teachers have greater influence on future\ngenerations than any other profession.\nWhat does Teaching offer you in return ?\nNew opportunities\nTeaching is a vigorous and growing profession. It offers\nthe graduate greater opportunities than ever before,\nboth in developing professional skills and in achieving\nposts of influence and responsibility \u2014 often far earlier\nthan in many other careers. For example, nearly half of the men graduate teachers between 25 and 29 hold such\nposts and receive salaries well above the basic scale.\nAbout half of those in their 30's are heads of depart-ment s, earning up to \u00a32,330, or hold even higher posts.\nOnefifthofthose now in their 40's are headmasters who\nmay earn salaries up to \u00a33,850. The prospects are even\nbetter for graduates with first or second class honours, or\na higher degree.\nNew ideas - new initiative\nThe mastery of teaching skills and the evolution of new\nmethods are a stimulating challenge. New discoveries\nand new knowledge present teachers with problems for\nwhich there are no precedents. New communication\ntechniques and aids must be developed.\nTraining: an extension of your knowledge\nSome graduates feel uncertain whether they are\ntemperamentally suited to teaching. The one-year\npost-graduate training course equips you to start your\ncareer confidently on a basis of practical experience\nas well as theory.\nWhy not find out more?\nTalk things over with your Appointments Board, and\nask for the new booklet, 'Careers in Education for\nGraduates', or write for a copy to Room 114 ( )\nDepartment of Education and Science, Curzon Street,\nLondon, W.I. It describes the schools of today and the\nkind of teachers they need; their salaries and special\nallowances.\nHe needs trained minds like yours\nto fit him for tomorrow's world\nIisued by th* Department of Education and Sei enc t TIPS FOR\nT0TTIES\nT PRESUME that most of you\nare either living in or flat-sharing and so managing on a budget and, therefore, in this edi-tion, I will quote some \" with-it\"\nclothes, obtainable within reasonably easy reach of S.W.7, with\nprice very much in mind. I shall\nalso find time in the article to\nquote you a budget tinned meal\nfor your gas-rings.\nBlack-and-white Op Art is \"way-in\"\nand if you buy felt, you will be clever,\nbecause it's warm, as well as \" with-it.\" I 'tain in Knightsbridge have one\nlittle dress which I noticed, at about\n50s. in pinafore style, so you could\nwear a pretty b'. ouse or sweater during\nthe day, but the round neckline, edged\nwith white daisy muffs, makes it -oil\nenough alone, for informal evenings.\nIf you want to keep up with the\nnew Monsieur Courreges length\u20143 in.\nabove the knee\u2014you just cut the bot-tom, for there's no hem! ! or to look\nwildly gone, cut scallops\u2014this could\nbe fun if you have ideas! !\nYou can stitch or stick with glue,\nextra cut outs on to your felt dresses\nlittle flowers, 3s. from Fenwicks. But,\nif you are good with your scissors and\nneedle, then why not make the whole\ndress yourself. Remember, no hems,\nwhat bliss! !\nBlack-and-white, abstract mod hand V bags to match in felt are quite inexpensive or in leather, a little more, of\ncourse, from Top Gear in King's RT'.\nThese shops also have pretty little\nblack crepe dresses, with a hip level\ns trio e of white, which are very smart.\nWarm and practical as well as \"in\"\nare thick stockings for winter. Woollands have a good selection, one I liked particularly was an unusual\ndogs tooth checked stretch in black\nand white at about 30s. There are\nalso paisley patterns too, and this\npaisley influence is getting carried as\nfar as Bermuda type pants\u2014would\nyou believe it? Under \u00a31 at Harrods\nand D.H. Evans, these could make\na fun gift for a fellow girl-friend\u2014\ndon't you think ?!!\nStill on the warm theme, (though\nwe shall probably have a heat wave\nnow) slacks are back in force this,\nseason;, particularly tweeds and trouser suits in coy w col worsted or\nchecks. Look out for the turn-up,\nsometimes with the front slit and almost never the under foot elastic\nthese days. Emcar stock is ts have\ngood ideas at keen prices, then higher\nup and more classic, come Jaeger,\nSloane Street. I like C. and A. for\nthis sort of outfit and it may be that\nthey are doing th tir three-piece again\nthis year. A straight skirt, trousers\nand a jacket to mix and match, was\nunder 10 guineas; see Oxford Circus\nBranch. I still like culottes too,\nslightly \" hippy,\" with a skinny\nsweater, narrow belt and school knee-high socks.\nNow, to food. If you like rice,\nthen I am sure a favourite of mine\ncould be yours too. It is Plumrose\nRisotto, savoury rice of Italian origin,\nof course, but made in Denmark and\ncontains chopped ham, mushrooms\nand onions. A large tin at 3s.3d. makes two average helpings, but you\ncan add to it with some crispy bacon\nor vegetables, such as pre-cooked\nfrozen peas, sweet corn, tomatoes or\na can of red Spanish pimento es. Or\nuse it with fresh cooked patna rice\nas a basis for your own risotto. It's easy to heat slowly anyway, with a knob of butter and a little water, but\ntake care not to burn.\n\n"

I:, half-backs being quick\nto get to grips with the I.C. forwards, so much so that I.C. saw little or nothing\nof the I...S. I., goal. Slack covering gave I..S. I. their first goal when a through\nball towards the left hand post was allowed to be deflected to the ins'.de-left\nwho promptly lashed it past Wojtoiwicz, giving him no chance.\nAfter this early setback I.C. pulled\nthemselves together and the exchanges\nwere about equal, in particular Hunt\nand Moreland strove manfully in\nmidfield, but the forwards still failed\nto capital is e on this and did not look\nlike scoring.\nThe L.S.E. second goal came as a surprise when a cross from the right\nto the far post was turned into the\nnet from close range.\nrevival\nAfter the interval I.C. came more\ninto the game. Against a tiring L.S.E. defence the forwards, in particular\nEastell and Luxton, started to shine,\nand it came as no surprise when I.C. reduced the arrears. An Eastell shot\nwas desperately pushed out by the\nkeeper to Widelski who miraculously\nscrewed in the ball from an almost\nimpossible angle. Although I.C. tried\nevery trick they knew, they could\nnot equalise and L.S.E. ran out win-ner s.

All the more the pity then that we have no badminton\ncourts.\nThere is the gym, of course, but with fifty fresher s signing on this year one\ncourt is not much use. The position will be better from next week as\nthey have obtained the use of Nine Elms public baths but that is only\nonce a week and no substitute for our own courts near college. Badminton\ncourts are planned in the new Sports Centre but that seems remoter\nevery term.\n|\nfight for it\nDOWN by the Union Cloakroom there is a notice board headed Boxing and\nGymnastics. It is a forgotten notice board ; the pictures on it never\nchange and you will see no sportsmen meeting by it. Ever since the\ndays of the Rectors Cup we have failed, with rare exceptions, to produce\nany keen pugilists.\nSo bad is the situation that Harry May, postgraduate fresher and welter-weight\nboxer has joined Bermondsey Boxing Club to find fellow enthusiasts. This\nsituation, Harry tells me, extends to U.L. where almost anyone willing to\nenter the ring can make the team.

    "content": "FELIX9 SATISFACTION ?\nBy CHRIS LAMPARD\n\" JJKE A CROWDED, sweaty\ncattle-market,\" was how one\nfreshman described the\nFreshers' Hop of Saturday, 9\nOctober.\nPerhaps a more accurate comparison would be a Turkish slave market,\nas bloodshot male eyes scanned the\nvaried ranks of females (all shapes\nand sizes) for fresh innocent talent.\nFor most of the evening the concert hall was so crowded that all\nmovement, save an occasional ecstatic\ntwitch, was impossible. Meanwhile\nin the upper refectory another group\npounded out their souls to a small\naudience which was at times down to\na disinterested dozen.\nAs at nearly all college dances the\nbar was the cause of more frustration\nthan anything else. Despite sterling\nwork by those serving, it required vast\nreserves of patience, tenacity, brute\nforce and ignorance to eventually get\na drink (which was, towards the end\nof the evening, almost bound to be\nserved in an unwashed glass).\nThe evening did have its spots of\nlight relief such as the I.C. man, rather\nthe worse for drink, who staggered\ninto the Concert Hall clutching his\nsagging trousers, and proclaimed \"My\nkingdom for a woman or a safety\npin.\" The group playing in the Concert Hall, had to be recalled by a slow\nhand clap after an inordinately long\nbreak of over an hour.\nSurely, it would be better to follow the lead of Q.M. C., Chelsea and\nBattersea and go for quality not\nquantity. A top recording group and\nmore expensive tickets prove far more\nenjoyable and popular. Other colleges do this for their fresher s' hops\nand the result is far superior to ours.\nNADIR OF TASTE\nTHE NEW CROP OF EATING-HOUSES here in London, the Chicken Inns, the\nGolden Eggs and Wimpeys contain examples of contemporary\nculture which epi to mise the\nnadir of taste.\nIt is not so much that the food represents the lowest common denominator in mass-eating habits but more\nthat the decoration, the poster reds\nand greens which disfigure your fellow\neaters into HAMMER film extras,\nbetray a nonchalance towards the\nsensibilities of people which is almost\ninsulting.\nI remember reading about an\nemerging non-culture which includes\nfor example, non-books by Ian Fleming for people who don't like books\nand non-music by MUSAK for people\nwho don't like music, ana so on. ine\nessence of this non-culture is not that\nthey are bad examples of an art form,\nbut no examples at all.\nThe garish quality of some of the\nnew eating-houses fits in this non-culture as a non-decor, a style of\ndecoration that will never offend anybody because of its lack of reference\nto any existing decorative values and\njudgements. The polythene age. in\ndecor, as in haute couture, seems bent\non announcing itself in the brightest\npossible colours.\nIt is with some misgivings that I notice the new lower lounge furniture\nhas echoes of this non-decor. Its\njuxtaposition of 4 distinct and fairly\nstrident chair colours seems to have\ntaken the usual relaxation out of the\nlounge, even though the comfort may\nwell have been increased.\nCLIVE HEATH\nStartatthe\nheart of British\nIndustry\nwith\nEach year Turner & Newall, one of the\nbig groups at the heart of British\nIndustry, offers a few outstanding\ngraduates in science, engineering or the\narts, a career keyed from the start to\nthe areas in which expansion is at its\nfastest . . . opportunity at its best.\nThis is T&N The T4N group is a major supplier of basic\nmaterials to Britain's manufacturing and\nexport industries.

Everyone in the house joins in\nthese festivities, and there is no landlord to complain about excessive noise.\nUnlike their earlier digs they could\nbath when they liked\u2014though only at\ntimes mutually convenient with their\nbath-mates. Here, too, they can cook\ntheir own meals, and though partaking at Mr. Mooney's emporia at\nlunchtimes, they resort to their own\n\" poisoning \" for breakfast, and evenings and weekend meals.\nAmong the disadvantages, however,\nwere the \u00a310 deposits for \" breakage\nand \" electricity \" and having to buy\nbedclothes, cutlery, crockery and\ncooking utensils.

The\nroom is heated by a gas fire which\nwith the gas ring, operates off a slot-meter.\nThe room has been recently redecorated and is well furnished. A reasonable number of bookcases and\ntables are in the room and the land-lady, who fancies herself as an interior decorator, has drawn up\nschemes for additional elaborate fur-nishi ngs. They may hold parties if they want\nto, provided that they are infrequent\nand that their \" broad-minded \" landlady is given adequate warning. Normally, however, their guests have to\nbe out by eleven.\nAs they are living so close to college they will be able to lake a reasonable part in Union life unlike\nthe others that we have interviewed.\nIf one fails to get into hall, as\nJames did, it is difficult to see how\none could live much closer to college\n\u2014and this place has the added\nadvantage of a system of emergency\nlighting.

    "content": "FELIX5 KANT A POLL Optimistic Ubbelohde\nby PETE WALLUM\n* BLINKERS ARE NOT PROVIDED WITH AB. Sc.\" sums up\nthe opinion of Professor Ubbelohde, head of the Chemical Engineering Dept., in his General Studies talk to a near capacity\naudience on Thursday, 7th October. His discussion of the problems of Universities was particularly relevant to colleges such as\nOur own.\nAlthough, in the Victorian era it\nwas possible for the Master of a famous college to say, \" I am the\nMaster of this College, and what I do not know is not knowledge,\" this\nis now inconceivable ; it is essential\nfor courses to-day to be highly specialised to enable us to approach the\nvery frontiers of human knowledge.\nNevertheless, one must fight against\nbecoming an \" intellectual serf. It\nis not the job of the University to\nprovide courses of these essential subjects that of necessity are excluded\nfrom our curriculum, but entirely\nup to the individual to indulge in\nthese studies in his free time.\nDespite the huge amount of work\nnecessary on a students degree course\nit is essential that some time is spent\non these subjects, for judgement of\nhuman beings and the power of communicating information to others will\nonly be acquired if one carried out a suitable private course of reading and\nstudy.\nThe Professor feels that in every\nstudent's busy social life some time\nshould be allocated to this aim. Professor Ubbelohde was optimistic\nabout the courses given at I.C., feeling them to be as useful as any course\ngiven anywhere. But forget not that\nTN THEIR FIRST survey KANTA\n' pol U asked a random sample of\n100 members of Imperial College\nUnion two questions regarding this\nyear's IC Carnival. The first arose\nfrom last week's Felix editorial comment in which it was suggested that\nthe best time for Carnival w ou'.d be\nnot May but the end of the spring\nterm.\nWhat would be the best month of\nthe year in which to hold the Carnival Charity Week ?\nConsidering that the organisation\nof a Carnival Week needs to be done\nduring term-time the histogram indicates that the most popular month\nwould be March. An April Carnival\nWeek would require that the Carnival\norganisers must give up much of their\nEaster Vacation.\n// these charities were proposed at\nthe next Union Meeting (21 October),\nwhich one would you vote to be the\nCarnival Charity ?\nNotting Hill Housing Trust 8\nDr. Barnardo's Homes 3\nOxfam 29\nLady Hoare's Thalidomide Appeal 9\nCancer Research 39\nFrom these results it seems certain\nthat a large charity\u2014as opposed to a small national or a local one\u2014will\nget ICU's support, with the odds in\nfavour of one relating to health rather\nthan to famine. Will Mr. David\nReich, past President of Debates, try\nfor a third time to advocate the Imperial Cancer Research Fund ?\nHowever, a little-known charity\u2014such as Multiple Sclerosis Research\u2014\nspoken of enthusiastically and convincingly may well sway the masses.\nPROSPECTUS REVIEWED\nBy PETER COMBES\nTTIE NEW PROSPECTUS, now available, is an improvement\non last year's. The basic format has been radically changed,\nthanks probably to the new Publications Officer, Miss A.B. Nolan.\nThe only obvious mistake in this\nnew version is the college map. Why\ncouldn't it have been left as before\ncovering two sides, instead of cutting\nit down to one side and making it\nface the wrong way?\nThe whole quality of the printing\nhas been improved, the paper is better\nand the choice of photographs is more\nstriking. The staff list is much more\naccessible than before and it has been\npersonalised by the inclusion of some\nChristian names. But why did only a few staff members give their Christian\nnames? Can the others be worried\nabout beine respected?\nThe admission procedure has been\nmade a special section at the end.\nHere it cannot be missed owing to the\ninclusion of a blue index sheet. At\nfirst glance this looks like a mistaken\ninclusion of another cover but in fact\nit is a clever way of drawing one's attention. Since these prospectuses are\nsent to tentative I.C. students this part\nof the volume is the most important.\nThe actual written matter is the\nsame as that which has appeared in\nprevious editions but the change of\nlayout and type has given it a new\nlook which is admirable.\nIMPERIAL COLLEGE\nCOMMEMORATION\nDAY\nThursday 28 October\nRoyalAlbert Hall 3pm RCS on show\nTickets FREE\nCommemoration Day celebrates the visit to the College in 1945\nof the late King George VI, accompanied by Queen Elizabeth the\nQueen Mother\u2014now Chancellor of the University of London\u2014at the\ncentenary of the Royal College of Chemistry, the oldest forerunner\nof the Imperial College.\nThis year's celebration will be held on Thursday, 28th October,\nin the Royal Albert Hall at 3 p.m. The special visitor will be the\nRt. Hon. Lord Florey, O.M., President of the Royal Society.\nBefore the ceremony an interdenominational church service will\nbe held in Holy Trinity Church, Prince Consort Road ; the preacher\nwill be the Rt. Rev. W.P. F. Chadwick, Bishop of Barking.\nAfter the ceremony the work and buildings of the Royal College\nof Science will be on view to visitors.\nTea for present students will be in the main Refectory, South\nSide, and tickets can be obtained free from the Union Office.\n\n"

The system employed was to\nshake every locker on the first three\no or s, noting the one which made the\nloudest noise ; this was locker 129.\nAt 11.07 on Saturday the a pd lock on the locker was cut, and there followed a period of silent worship,\nwhile it was found that the Spanner\nas really inside, and not some students\nhoard of nickel-lead. At 11.10. the\nraiding party left Civils, carrying the\nSpanner openly for all to see\u2014a few\nlads looked on, but no action wa;\ntaken, and the getaway van, complete\nwith two bubble car outriders, disappeared in the direction of South\nLondon.\nSN0WD0NIA\n\u2022\"THE MOUNTAINEERING CLUB\nI is inviting everybody who longs\nto get out of London for a couple\nof days to come on the Meet to\nLlanberis Pass, North Wales, next\nweekend.\nThe coach starts from the Union at\n6 p.m. Friday returning Sunday night.\nIf you want to try a little rock-climb-ing, our experts will be willing to\nteach.\nSurprisingly little equipment will be\nneeded as most will be provided.

For, in spite of the 33 per\ncent, rise in price\u2014far in excess of Brother George Brown's wishes!\u2014Mr.\nFaville's share of the sales has dropped fr qm one-third to one-quarter.\nEach time you buy a copy of the University of London Union newspaper, you\ngive the local ULU agent a penny. In this way last year's ULU agent in\nIC accumulated over \u00a360\u2014not bad for once a week picking up a pile\nof papers (delivered to the door), distributing them to sales points in\nthe college, and collecting the proceeds.\nAs in so many other things ULU seems to have a false sense of values, for\nthose other amateurs who do the \" real work \" on Sennet, writing and\nediting, do not get as ou \u2014past Sennet editors have even bought stories\nand been dismissed!

Now ever, the newspapers\nare beginning to make tentative links.\nIs ULU to survive? Malet Street provides little that the London college\nunions cannot themselves offer\u2014the excellent swimming pool is a notable\nexception. I think that it will survive, but it will never attain more than\na vestige of London student life.\nIs survival enough? ULU may only improve with a thorough spring-clean\u2014\nand what better place to start than to reduce the price of Sennet again to\n3d. and so removing that source of income to ULU agents. Alternately\nif Sennet is so keen to give away pennies\u2014why does not the Sennet BoarH\napproach college newspapers with a view to distribution through their\nbetter organised channels?\nis looking now for\n900 GRADUATES& PROFESSIONALLY QUALIFIED\nVOLUNTEERS to serve in the developing\ncountries in 1966/67\nConsult your Appointments Board or write to\nVOLUNTARY SERVICE OVERSEAS\n3 HANOVER STREET LONDON W1\nAS CHAIRMAN OF THE CARNIVAL BOARD, I would like to\nreply to the rather uninformed and\nillogical part of you f last (record\nlength?) leading article headed \"Why\ntwo Carnivals?\"\nThe point, sir, that you failed to\ngrasp is that there aren't \u2014two, I mean. There is a Rag Week this\nNovember and a Carnival Week next\nMay and the two are, intentionally,\ndissimilar. The whole emphasis of the\nRag Week will be on outside collections (i.e. not from students). While\nthe Carnival Week will concentrate on\nbig events in the Union every night\nwith little or no \" commando work.\"\nIn this way, we hope that, during\nthe Rag Week people use other talents\nand energies to collect far more from\nthe general public than has ever been\nrealized by the ill-attended pre-exam i nation foray in May.

The\nnew furniture has turned the whole\nroom into little more than a waiting\nroom. The sharp lines and right angles made by the furniture leave it\ndevoid of any charm.\nAbout the only welcome innovation is the cocktail bar in the far\ncorner.

In fact, the first few\nweeks of the session are the only ones\nwhen work burdens are not heavy for\nanyone, and of these the week of\nNov. 6th13 th is the only real \"blank\"\none\u2014hence we show it for the Rag\nWeek.\nYou reach other questionable state-ment s, and I have .other retaliating\narguments, but this is long enough.\nI would be a fool, sir, to claim that\neither the system or timing is perfect,\nbut I think that they are just about\nthe best that we can get.\nAnyway, we have got them for this\nsc s ion and Chris Hocking and his\nhelpers are hoping to have a record\nyear.

It\nappears to me that, like locking inter-hall doors, it is a rather unnecessary\nrestriction on people's movements.\"\nTheir purpose would be to locate\noffending rooms, especially between\n1\n1 p.m. and 1 a.m., and seek to quell\nany disturbance.\nLast November Southside was\nthreatened with the possibility of\nbeing served with a court injunction\nby Westminster City Council at the\nrequest of the mews residents which\ncould have led to its closure.\nTechnicians stake their claims\n'THE STRIKE of Graded\nTechnicians on Tuesday, 12\nOctober, was. Imperial ColMAX SAYS \"GLAD RAG\nBALL WILL MAKE \u00a34.000\"\nAT A PRESS Conference organised by Beaver, the newspaper of\ntin' London School of Economics, on Saturday, 9 October, Max\nWilliams\u2014this year's Chairman of London Students' Carnival\u2014\nannounced that he expected this\nyear's Glad Rag Ball to effect a profit of at least \u00a34,000.\nThe whole Carnival\u2014due to take\nplace in 4J necks time\u2014will, he\nhopes, give over \u00a35,000 to charity.\nThis would be in complete contrast to\nlast year's debacle when LSC made a \u00a3916 loss.\nThese high hop;s he expressed in\nspite of his ow'. p: vio us unfortunate experiences in a ii, of charity. A dance he organised at Battersea last\nyear turned his expected \u00a3300 profit\ninto a \u00a3314 loss.\n! l his defence il s:io ul d,z pointed\nout that 300 of the ticket^ were stolen.\nOnly half were recovered. 1.500\npeople had b::n expected to turn up.\nOnly 450 appeared.\nTom McNally, President of University Co'leg e Union, taunted Max.\n\" You i; ill expect the students of London to take ;i in> hi'- gamble on this\nyear's Carnival.\"\nHowever, last year's Glad Rag Ball\nmade a profit of \u00a32.500. But this was.\nthe sole organised event not to appear\nin the red.\nIC and King's College have been\njoined in their official boycott of\nLSC by UC, Westfield College. Goldsmith's College, Avery Hill Training\nCollege and LSE. It is rumoured\nthat Battersea and Chelsea Colleges\nalso will not support it this year.\nMeanwhile, it remains in doubt\nwhether the London Carnival will be\nallowed to take place. For latest\nnews see back page.\nleg e's first experience of an \"in-dust rial dispute.\"\nThe stoppage\u2014called by the Association of Scientific Workers, in conjunction with other Trade Unions\naffected, in support of a national wage\nclaim and an increased London allowance\u2014was claimed by the Union to\nbe 90 per cent, complete.\nSalary scales for the technicians\nare the responsibility of the Universities' Committee on Technical Staffs.\n\" It was this body which proposed that\nthe claim for an increased basic rate,\n\"to bring the technicians into line with\ntheir fellows in the Scientific Civil\nService, should be referred to arbitration. This the Unions rejected, on the\ngrounds that \" it did not amount to\na serious attempt at negotiation.\"\nHowever. Londoft allowances are the\nconcern of the University, and the\ntechnicians are pressing for a temporary London weighting pending the outcome of the national negotiations, over and above the permanent \u00a340\u2014\u00a360 p.a. weighting, back r dated to August, already offered.\nThere were 90 pickets at main entrances to the College until 10.15\nwhen they went by bus to the Senate\nHouse to join a protest march by 400\ntechnicians from other colleges.\nThe strike was said to be practically\ncomplete in Mines, Botany, Zoology,\nPhyUlct, and Civil and .Mechanical\nEngineering. Least support was found\nin Electrical Engineering and Inorganic Chemistry.\nSupport was also given by experimental officers in Civil, maintenance\nelectricians working for a contracting\nfirm who refused to enter the prem-is es, and a lorry driver who refused\nto make a delivery. A professor\nsent the technicians a telegram of en-courage ment. \u2022Many strikers apparently made\nefforts to avoid inconveniencing the\nstudents and teaching staff of the Col!\ne ge by leaving work prepared the day\ni>e fore. Together with the fact that\nexperimental officers and technical\nassistants were not affected, this explains why most departments functioned normally on Tuesday, without\nthe 320 technicians.\nProfessor Rogers of Birkbeck College ha* (j io pose a that his students of\nindustrial psychology should, as one\nof many exercises, investigate this\ngentlemanly strike during the coming\nyear. The A. Sc.W. ask us to point\nout that Dr. Rogers wants to investigate the dispute, and not the parties\nto it!\n\n"

IMPRESSES\nAACHEN STUDENTS\nFirst Company in the world\nto market a micro-integrated\nrange of computers\nOpenings for graduates\nEnglish Electric Leo Marconi is in the forefront of the\nBritish Computer industry. With the recent announcement of the new micro-integrated System 4 range,\nEELM now market the most advanced range of\ncomputers in the world.\nA breakthrough like this is the result of years of\nwork, involving first-class brains and abilities from a vast range of specialist skills. EELM are at the head of\ntheir field only because the best people work for them.\nWhy?\nFirst of all, of course, salaries and fringe benefits are.\ngood throughout the computer industry. But it is the\nenvironment that really counts. At EELM career planning ensures that promotion and responsibility come\nquickly to those wr th ability. The activities of the\nCompany are so varied that, whatever your particular\ncareer interest, EELM have a job for you which will\nchallenge your ability to the utmost.\nRight now EELM are expanding. They need graduates from every academic field now and at the end of\nthis academic year. Opportunities exist in London,\nKidsgrove (North Staffs.) and various provincial\ncities.\nA booklet \"Careers in Computers\", which gives a detailed description of all the types of openings that\nexist in the Organisation, will be sent on request.\nCompany representatives will be visiting the University\nearly in the New Year and arrangements to meet them\nshould be made through the Appointments Board.\nIf any further information is required please write\nto:-I.V. Pugh, University Liaison Officer,\nEnglish Electric-Leo-Marconi Computers Ltd.,\nKidsgrove, Stoke-on-Trent, Staffs.\nThey talk to Dick Waterman\nQ N SATURDAY, 9 October, four students from Aachen Technische Hokesdiute arrived in London to visit I.C. This is in an\nexchange for four I.C. men who visited Aachen last July.\nI met and interviewed them in\nSouthside bar under the benevolent\n. eye of President Fletcher. The four\nstudents\u2014Joseph Gerard (electrical\nengineering), Nick Nauwahl (architecture) Ernst Singelmann (civil en-g in ee ring, and President of Aachen)\nand Gerd Schmaht (mineral techno-logy) have been entertained by Union\nofficials and have visited departments\nof I.C. relevant to their studies.\nTheir general impression of the\nCollege is that I.C. is an excellent college at which to attend a course in\nscience or technology, but they prefer Aachen as its courses cover a wider range of subjects\u2014Architecture,\nPhilosophy and Theology are included\n?nd in fact Aachen will soon achieve\null University status, including arts\ncourses in its curriculum.\nOn the subject of grants, Mr. Nan. wahl told me that about 40 per cent,\nof the students receive awards at\nAachen, 20 per cent, of these coming\nfrom the State and the rest from industry or religious and other or-gan is at ions. Another interesting point\nis that students whose parents earn\nover \u00a31,200 p.a. cannot receive grants\nfrom the Government.\nIt is also difficult at Aachen, as here\nat I.C., to get a hall place. There\nare 10,000 students and only 1,100\nhall places. Add to this the fact that\np nee a Student is in hall he is not removed except in cases of discipline\nand the situation at I.C. becomes\ncomparatively good.\nMr. Nauwahl, whose English was\nthe best of the four visitors, was most\nimpressed by the facilities for relaxation provided, particularly in Southside, and in the college generally,\nstudents in Aachen not having such\nluxuries except those in hall.\nJudging by the reactions of the students they have enjoyed their short\nstay here and share my feelings that\nmore exchange, visits should be arranged with foreign students.\nTactful remark of the evening re.\nArthur's beer, \" In two or three\nweeks we might get used to it\"\n(good mornings begin with Gilliatt)\nEvery Sunday morning you can enjoy the razor-sharp theatre reviews of Penelope Gilliatt. She\nbrings a fresh, astringent intelligence to the\njob. You may disagree violently with what she\nsays but you will relish the style with which\nshe says it. If you are tired of the jaded, predictable opinions of the establishment critics,\nbegin next Sunday morning with Gilliatt. You'll\nfind it a refreshing change.\nIn The Observer every Sunday\n\n"

The\njourney takes them about three\nquarters of an hour but parking is no\nproblem in East Sheen\u2014there is\nalways room to park in the dark alley\nway that serves as a street.\nThey hope that they will be able\nto find a better place in the next\nmonth that will enable them to move\naway from this flat where they even\nhave to wait to midnight to do their\nwashing up in freedom.\nKen James Stuart Trevor\nRent . 3 -10 - 0 4 - 10 - 0 3 - 5 - 0 4 - 4 - 0\nSen/ices extra (water,\ngas, oil, electricity) 5 - o70500 Laundry extra 3 - 0 3 - 0 3 - 0 5 - 0\nFood extra 2 - 10 - 0 3 - 10 - 0 2 - 10 - 0 15 - 0\nTOTAL per week 6 -38 - 0 8 - 10 - 0 6 - 3 - 0 5 - 4 - 0\nTravel time (mins) Bus 15 Walk 5 Gar 40 Tube 40\nTravel cost 6 - 0 0 8 - 0 18 - 0\nTOTAL (inc travel) 6 - 1 4 - 0 8 - 1 0 - 0 6 - 1 1 - 0 6 - 2 - 0\nLittle room for work \u2022\u2014\nTrevor must study in\nthe dining room\nIn the table we have attempted to draw some comparisons, with\nregard especially to costs, of the respective forms of living. For\nlaundry we have assessed 3/- as an approximate Launderette charge\nfor a week's washing. Travel costs are listed separately as, in most\ncases, these may be reclaimed from the students award-giving body.\nTea But\nNot Bed\nM\\y E DON'T MIND lady\nfriends in to tea, but not up\nto bed,\" is the attitude of\nTrevor's landlord to a boys' favourite subject Trevor is a first-year Mineral Technologist sharing digs in Ealing with first-year Maths and General Science\nstudents from Queen Elizabeth\nCollege.\nThis was the second address supplied by the U.L. Lodgings Bureau\nthat Trevor viewed before coming to\nI.C. Here he has bed and breakfast,\nevening and extra weekend meals for\nfour guineas plus a sizeable travel\nburden\u2014to be reimbursed next sum-mer.\nThey work in the dining room and\nuse one of the two bedrooms as\nlounge space. Shelf-space in their\nwork-room is meagre but is, they say,\nmore than compensated for in the\nbedroom.\nAlthough the landlord is on night-work, they feel obliged not to hold\nparties, which might upset the rest of\nthe family. As it is it seems that the\nlandlord does most of the cooking\nand housework; but perhaps hi* wife\nwill chip in more later.\nMany extra services are provided.\nTrevor does not even have to make\nhis bed. But laundry costs an extra\n5s. per week. Of the four, this is,\nperhaps, best for those who are lazy\nabout eating and domestic chores, or\nproduce disastrous effects in horn c cooking.\nBut, echoing the thoughts of so\nmany suburban-based students, Trevor\nsays, \" stuck out here, I don't think\nI 'll get the chance to do much in the\nUnion \" The last tube leaves South\nKensington about 12.30 and the all-night buses ai\u00a3 infrequent. Their own\nentertainment is on tap, however, for\none can play the piano, and that very\ninstrument stands proudly by the\ndining room door.\n\n"
