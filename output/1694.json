    "content": "ISSUE 1694\nFELIX\nBOOKS books.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n13\nPure Hollywood: a long-anticipated UK debut proves\nto be worth the wait\nChristineSchutt\u2019sshortstorycollectionisunsettlingandhaunting,withhermasteryoflanguageusedtoperfectly\nportray her lonely, isolated subjects.\nC\na l i f o r n i a ,\ndespite its\nassociations in\npopular culture\nwith dreaming and love\nand soul, can be an inhospitable place; the beauty\nof the sunshine that gives\nthe state its nickname is\ntempered by its power \u2013\nto dessicate, oppress, and\ncrack open, like asphalt\nrutted open by an eternal\nsummer. In her seminal\nessay \u2018Some Dreamers of\nthe Golden Dream\u2019, Joan\nDidion, whose acuity in\nportraying the hollowness\nof the everyday is deeply\nunsettling, writes of a\nCalifornia buffeted by the\nSanta Ana wind, which\n\u201ccomes down through\nthe passes at 100 miles an\nhour and whines through\nthe eucalyptus windbreaks\nand works on the nerves.\u201d\nIt\u2019s a land where \u201cevery\nvoice seems a scream\u201d,\ncaught in \u201cthe season of\nsuicide and divorce and\nprickly dread, wherever\nthe wind blows.\u201d\nThese words by Didion\nare what come to mind\nwhen reading the pieces\ncontained within Pure\nHollywood, the latest\ncollection of short stories\nby American writer\nChristine Schutt. Despite\nthe fact that Schutt\u2019s tales\nzip all over the American\nlandscape, they remind\nme, at their heart, of the\nemptiness commonly\nassociated with cities like\nLos Angeles, of ripeness\ncurdled into rot, of the\nunsettling power of the\nSanta Ana wind.\n\u201cChristine\nSchutt\u2019s stories\nmake me think\nof ripeness\nturned to rot,\nand the Santa\nAna wind\u201d\n\u201cSchutt\nwrites with\na detached\nprose style,\nand body\nhorror to rival\nCronenberg\u201d\nThe stories, which\nrange greatly in length,\nfrom several dozen pages\nthrough to a couple of\nparagraphs, are concerned\nwith lonely, maladjusted\nindividuals, struggling to\nmake their way through\nlife. A horse trek through\nmountainous terrain sees\na woman plagued with un-certainty; a young actress\ngoes to the stage lot while\nher older husband has\na cardiac arrest in the\nswimming pool; a widow\nsinks into a slumber of\nanger and fear and drink.\nSchutt writes with a\ndetached prose style,\nkeeping her subjects at\narm\u2019s length, making use\nof this distance to create\na sense of the uncanny.\nIt\u2019s a deeply unsettling\ntechnique, one aided and\nabetted by her skill in\ncreating a sense of bodily\nhorror to rival Cronenberg.\nIn \u2018Species of Special\nConcern\u2019, for example, an\nunanticipated TSA search\ntakes a couple by surprise\n\u2013 \u201cThey hadn\u2019t expected a\npat-down at security, and\ntried to explain what was\ninside Nancy that made\nthe machines beep\u201d. Or\nin the two-page \u2018Where\nDo You Live? When You\nNeed Me\u2019, which takes\nplace one hot New York\nsummer in the 1980s, a\nseason \u201cwhen little parts\nof little bodies turned up\nin KFC buckets in dump-sters in the city\u2026weeks\nof record heat and brown\nair\u201d.\nThis neutral horror is\nperhaps most brilliantly\nexplored in \u2018The Hedges\u2019,\nin which a wealthy couple\ntake their two-year old\nchild to a holiday resort.\nFrom the start, Schutt sets\nup a delicious tension:\nwith the child suffering\nfrom an unspecified\nillness, she describes the\n\u201cclotted, green-sound of\nher little boy\u2019s breathing,\nan unwell honk that did\nnot blend in with the\nsashaying pants and\nbeachy-wet breeze of the\nisland.\u201d The family drift\naround the resort under\na cloud of frustration\nand resentment, with\nthe mother Lolly, only\ninterested in the answer\nto the question \u201chow long\ndid motherhood last?\u201d.\nThe son is described in a\nway that makes the gorge\nrise in the throat: \u201ccereal\nstuck to him, as it would\nto anything that oozed.\u201d\nAnd, of course, things\ninevitably come crashing\ndown on the family, and\n\u2013 likewise \u2013 on the reader.\nThere is an existential\nthreat lurking in the corner\nof all of Schutt\u2019s stories,\na sense of inevitable\ntragedy, slick with cold\nsweat, that inhabits her\npages. Planned picnics are\nsuffused with a migraine\naura of resentment \u2013 \u201cthe\nfood they ate was too\nsalty or too dry: no tastes\nto speak of\u201d \u2013 while\ncharacters are assailed\nby the world outside\nthe bubbles they have\nconstructed: \u201cmuted new\nflickers on the flat screen:\ngaudy mayhem.\u201d And\nwhile Schutt\u2019s characters\nmay have \u201cpooh-poohed\nthe ominous signs\u201d, the\nreaders cannot.\nSchutt\u2019s prose style\nis a thing of wonder and\nfrustration: she constructs\nher sentences full of interjections and meanderings,\ndrawing the reader in a\ncircuitous route towards\ntheir destination. Frequently dry and curt,\nSchutt will sucker punch\nthe reader with a series\nof barbs, before delivering sentences of lyrical\nbeauty and grace, which\nstand out like sharp cacti\nin a flat desert. The end\nsentence to her story \u2018The\nLady from Connecticut\u2019,\nfor example:\n\u201cCars pass, several in a\nrow, from a party, perhaps,\nfollowing each other\nhome \u2013 sober drivers, she\nhopes, soberer than she,\nyet she moves back in the\nditch, which isn\u2019t a ditch\nso much as a broad rut\nfilled with fallen leaves\nand broken branches,\nfieldstone and mist rising\nover a landscape pierced\nas quaintly as a quilt, and\nthe lady from Connecticut,\na loose stitch in it.\u201d\nThe stories in Pure Hollywood are prickly things\nindeed. Schutt\u2019s vision is\nflat and unflinching and\nunforgiving, like a photo\ntaken with too much flash.\nLike a flash, however, the\ncollection lingers in the\nmind, imprinting itself\nupon my closed eyelids\nlong after I put it down.\nThe Santa Ana wind runs\nthrough Shutt\u2019s pages,\nrattling skeletons, kicking\nup dust, and, always,\nturning the page.\nSchutt\u2019s stories are dry and ironic, keeping a distance between reader and subject // Wikimedia\nBOOKS\nFred Fyles\nEditor-in-Chief\nAnd Other Stories. 120 pp.\nPURE HOLLYWOOD\nby Christine Schutt\n\n"

The actual very\nmuch larger redistribution\nto the highest paid was not\nmentioned.\n\u201cAffordability has\nnot been an issue as far\nas the highest paid are\nconcerned,\u201d the unions\ncontinue.\nClaims over affordabil-ity fuelled anger over proposed changes to pension\nschemes and led to strikes\nat universities across the\ncountry earlier this year.\nTom Pike, vice president of Imperial UCU,\ntold Felix: \u201cThe strike\nover pensions shouldn\u2019t\nbe seen as a one-off\ngrumble by staff at Imperial. There has been a\nlong-term erosion of pay,\nspecifically seen against\nthe increase in living costs\nin London, that has outstripped national figures.\n\u201cIt\u2019s both the squeeze\non the value of current\nsalaries and the threats\nto future pensions that\nhave made staff so upset,\nespecially when we\u2019ve recently seen a burgeoning\nsalary bill for the highest\npaid.\ninternal surpluses.\n\u201cClearly, the College\nhas chosen to devote its\nsurplus to buildings rather\nthan to staff,\u201d the unions\nwrite.\nWorking Hours\nA survey carried out\nby UCU in 2016 found\nImperial staff work an\naverage of 50 hours each\nweek. The legal maximum\nworking week is 48 hours.\nAccording to the\nunions\u2019 pay claim:\n\u201cOverall, academics gave\nnearly two days of work\nper week to Imperial for\nfree.\u201d It continues: \u201cEvery\nyear members of staff\nare donating thousands\nof pounds to Imperial\nCollege and risking their\nhealth as they do so.\u201d\nThe UCU survey\nreports the workloads of\nalmost three quarters of\nImperial staff increased\nin pace and intensity over\nthe previous three years.\nAlmost a quarter of staff\nsaid their workload was\nunmanageable most or all\nof the time.\nThe unions have also\ncriticised Imperial for\nemploying more academics on \u201cunnecessary\u201d\nfixed-term contracts,\nwhich are \u201cout of line\u201d\nwith similar universities,\nwhich employ staff on\nopen-ended contracts. In\nthe pay claim they state:\n\u201cFixed-term contracts are\nparticularly difficult for\nmembers of staff, making\nit difficult to obtain decent\nhousing, plan ahead or\ndevelop careers.\u201d Fixedterm contracts also make\nit harder for the College to\n\u201cbuild successful, stable\nteams of researchers and\nteachers\u201d.\nData provided by the\nunions show in 2015/16\nover 55% of academic\nstaff were on fixed-term\ncontracts, compared to 4%\nat neighbouring Russell\nGroup university UCL.\nTo improve working\nconditions, the unions\nhave called for action to\nprevent Imperial staff\nroutinely working beyond\ntheir contractual working\nhours and \u201cto harmonise\ncontractual hours at 35\n[hours per] week\u201d. The\nunions are also asking for\nan \u201cagreement\u201d to reduce\nthe number of staff hired\non fixed-term contracts\nand to convert existing\nfixed-term contracts into\nopen-ended contracts.\nhighest salary quartile are\nmen (the highest proportion among Russell Group\nuniversities); 56% of\nthose in the second-high-est salary quartile are also\nmen. Women at Imperial\nare also less likely to be\nawarded a bonus and\nreceive half the value of\nthe median bonus granted\nto men. The College\nstates that this discrepancy because there are\n\u201cfewer women in senior\npositions, and bonus payments are proportional to\nindividuals\u2019 salaries\u201d.\nAt the time, Provost\nJames Stirling said: \u201cWe\ndo not consider [the\ngender pay gap] accept-able. We are committed\nto addressing this imbalance by tackling barriers\nto progression.\u201d The\njoint trade unions have\ndescribed the College\u2019s\nresponse as \u201ccomplacent\u201d\nand note that \u201cCollege has\npublished no plans to take\nnew action\u201d.

I know it\u2019s\ndifficult \u2013 you\u2019re\njust reading this as an\nexcuse to avoid revising\nfor another soul-crushing\nhour \u2013 but try. You might\nremember there was a\nperiod of four weeks\nwhere our academic and\nsupport staff \u2013 along\nwith colleagues up and\ndown the country \u2013 went\non strike in opposition to\nthe proposed changes to\ntheir pension plans. The\nstrike came to an end,\nUniversities UK agreed to\ngo back to the negotiating\ntable, and the changes\nwere postponed, at least\nfor the immediate future.\nSome may believe the\nproblems highlighted in\nthe pensions dispute have\nnow been solved. They\nhave not. The debate,\nalthough on the surface\nabout pension pay, was,\nfor many, about something\nmuch deeper: the ongoing\nprivatisation of the higher\neducation sector. And,\nas this week\u2019s lead story\nshows, the effects this\nmove is having on our\nlecturers and support staff\nis immense.\nSince 2005, Imperial\nstaff have seen their pay\ncut in real terms by 1.1%\neach and every year; at\nthe same time, many of\nthem are facing increased\nworkloads, a blurring of\nthe work/life boundary,\nincreasingly metric-based\nassessment of their work,\nand casualisation of their\nemployment. Staff at\nImperial are being made\nworse off, year on year,\nand \u2013 realistically \u2013 this\nis a situation that cannot\nlast. Universities are institutions that run, at their\ncore, on a sense of good\nwill. Staff will regularly\nwork beyond their allotted\nhours, or complete tasks\nthat aren\u2019t included within\ntheir workflow, because\nthey genuinely love\nteaching and research;\nthey make a choice to,\noften, be paid much less\nthan they might do if\nthey went into the private\nsector, in order to follow\ntheir passions for science\nand education.\nWhen speaking about\nuniversity jobs, many\npeople will view them\nas similar to those in the\npublic sector; and they\nshould \u2013 Imperial gets\nvast amounts of money\neach year from the public\npurse to fund research that\ncan have a massive impact\non the world. But if we\nare to view Imperial jobs\nas public sector ones, and\nuse this to justify a lower\nsalary than in the private\nsector, then certain tradeoffs need to be made.\nPublic sector jobs should\nhave good pensions. That\nhasn\u2019t been the case.\nPublic sector jobs should\noffer security. That hasn\u2019t\nbeen the case. Public\nsector jobs shouldn\u2019t\ndemand hellish hours.\nThat has not been the case.\nMeanshile, in senior\nmanagement, salaries\nhave continued to soar\nin recent years: 130 staff\nnow earn more than the\nPrime Minister, with the\nmost senior members of\nmanagement earning on\naverage \u00a3280,000 each.\nThese figures, combined\nwith the fact Imperial\nmade nearly \u00a3120 million\nin surplus last year, are a\nslap in the face for staff\nwho have been facing\nreal-term pay cuts over\nthe past decade.\nThis article is the culmination of a trend that\nis having an impact, not\nonly at Imperial (although\nthe effects are arguably\nmore pronounced here),\nbut across the entire UK.\nThe fight for the future of\nour education didn\u2019t begin\nand end with the industrial\naction. It is not resolved. It\nis ongoing.

For\nthe uninitiated, Ramadan\nis one of the biggest\nevents in the Islamic\ncalendar, as Muslims\nfast daily from dawn till\nsunset. Whilst fasting is\ncommonly perceived as\nsimply giving up food\nand drink, it extends far\nfurther \u2013 Muslims are encouraged to abstain from\nbad thoughts and actions,\nand instead focus on inner\nreflection and spirituality.\nAbove all else, the\nRamadan experience is\nunique to every believer.\nBelow, we\u2019ve collected\nsome insights and tips\nfrom Muslims across\ncampus on what Ramadan\nmeans to them and how\nthey balance fasting with\nstudent life.\nWhat is Ramadan?\nWhilst avoiding food\nand drink between sunrise\nand sunset is partly to\nempathise with the poor\nthe main purpose of the\nmonth is about spiritual-ity: becoming closer to\nGod, giving up bad habits\nfor the entire month,\nand more. Ramadan is\na time filled with big\nget-togethers and family\nreunions. Repairing old\nrelationships and forming\nnew ones all for the\nblessings of Allah.

Get into a routine.\nRevision benefits from\nconsistency.

Author\nHwang Jungeun affords\nus a small glimpse into\nthe lives of Eungyo and\nMujae, two friends working at electronic stores.\nDuring a day out,\nEungyo is inexplicably\nfollowing a shadow in the\nwoods, and the temptation\nis too great to turn back\nuntil her friend Mujae\nasks her what she is doing.\nOnly in describing the\nshadow she is following\ndoes she realise it was\nher own. Mujae warns\nher, that no matter what\nhappens, she should never\nfollow her shadow again\nif it rises.\nMujae and Eungyo\nwork in two different\nelectronic stores, in the\nstores are housed in are to\nbe demolished, following\nthe ever-growing trend\nof gentrification. The\nrise of Eungyo\u2019s shadow\ndraws the attention of her\nemployer and Mujae, each\nsharing their experiences\nwith the physical manifestation of shadows, almost\nalways leading to tragedy.\nThe relationship\nbetween Mujae and\nEungyo develops, as the\nhardships they experience\nbring them closer to each\nother. This culminates\nin the final scene of the\nnovel, in which Mujae\nimpulsively buys what\nhe deems to be a car, and\ndrives with Eungyo to an\nisland for the day. Taking\nin what the island has\nto offer in scenery and\nculinarily, they miss the\nlast ferry off the island. As\nthe sun sets, and darkness\noverwhelms the island\u2019s\ninadequate streetlights,\nMujae\u2019s shadow begins\nto rise. Eungyo wakes\nMujae from his trance\nand they walk into the\nnight with the shadow\ntrailing, fearless of what\nits presence foreshadows.\nThe nature and significance of these shadows are\nambiguous: they appear\nto draw their strength\nas their owner weakens,\nslowly overcoming them\nand their lives. Why\ndo these shadows rise?\nDo they only afflict the\npoor or are they simply\na metaphor? These are\nquestions left unanswered.\nFrankly, that confused me\nrather than piqued my\ncuriosity. I confess that it\nwas difficult to put down\nthe novel as I sought to\nglean more knowledge\nof the shadows, but was\nleft disappointed when\nit was not forthcoming.\nThe novel does touch on\nthe least advertised aspect\nof the South Korean\nmiracle economic revo-lution: those left behind\nby its inequality. It was\nthis element that drew\nme most upon reading\nthe synopsis. However,\nthese were not explored\nto any substantial depth,\nwhich was unfortunate as\nI believe it would have\nadded a greater dimension to the novel.

You\u2019re looking for\ntrouble. Sometimes in\nthe beginning uncertainty\narises not because the\nwriting is difficult, but\nbecause it isn\u2019t difficult\nenough.\u201d\nThese words were\nspoken by the late\nAmerican author Philip\nRoth, who died earlier\nthis week, at the age of\n85, in an interview for the\nliterary magazine Paris\nReview. The interview\ntook place in the mid-1980s, well into his long\ncareer, but before he published some of his most\ncritically-acclaimed work.\nBorn in Newark, New\nJersey, in 1933, Roth grew\nup in the neighbourhood\nof Weequahic, at a time\nof great change. The son\nof first generation Jewish\nimmigrants, he came of\nage during the Second\nWorld War, and later\nsaw the incredible demographic shifts occurring\nin New Jersey, as \u2018white\nflight\u2019 from Newark to the\nsuburbs accelerated.\nAfter graduating from\nthe University of Chicago,\nRoth served for two years\nin the US Army, before\nbeginning his writing\ncareer with the publication\nof Goodbye, Columbus in\n1959. Between then and\ntoday, Roth published\n27 novels and novellas,\nspanning the range of the\n20th\n-century American\nexperience.\nRoth\u2019s most celebrated work was perhaps\nhis \u2018Newark Trilogy\u2019,\nwhich was comprised\nof American Pastoral\n(1997), I Married a\nCommunist (1998), and\nThe Human Stain (2000).\nThe historian Michael\nKimmage said the trilogy\nshowed Newark\u2019s \u201ctwentieth-century decline from\nimmigrant metropolis to\npost-industrial disaster\n[completing] the motif of\nhistory and its terrifying\npower over individual\ndestiny.\u201d\nAmerican Pastoral,\nwhich was the first of\nRoth\u2019s books I read,\ndetails the life and times of\nSeymour \u2018Swede\u2019 Levov,\na Jewish-American\nbusinessman, living a successful life in mid-century\nNewark, a lifestyle that\nis upended by the social\nand political turmoil of\nthe 1960s and \u201870s, with\nhis daughter rejecting her\nfather\u2019s middle-class lifestyle in favour of political\nradicalism.\nIt was one of the books\nI took with me when I\nwent interrailing with\nfriends, in the endless\nsummer before universi-ty; we took turns to read\nit, passing it between us,\nand marvelling at the way\nRoth managed to capture\na whole generation of the\nAmerican experience.\nWithin his work, Roth\nwas unusually prescient\nabout what was going on\naround him, and, indeed,\nwhat might happen in the\nfuture. His 2004 work,\nThe Plot Against America,\ndetails an alternative\nhistory, in which the\nisolationist Charles Lindbergh beats Roosevelt in\nthe 1940 election, leading\nto a rise in antisemitism,\nand a refusal to intervene\nagainst Hitler. Lindbergh,\nas many have pointed out,\nserves as a sort of pro-to-Trump, supporting the\nAmerica First Committee.\nIn The Human Stain,\ntoo, in which the protagonist \u2013 a white-passing\nmixed race academic \u2013 is\naccused of racism, Roth\nmanages to eerily predict\nhow identity would\nbecome a defining feature\nof modern politics.\nRoth remains one\nof the titans of modern\nAmerican literature, up\nthere with Saul Bellow\nor Toni Morrison.

They met\nwhen she was 12; her\ndebut album was released\nat 14; they were illegally\nmarried when she was 15.\nThe marriage was in 1994.\nKnowledge of this\nmarriage was widespread\nin the music industry.\nKelly\u2019s been quoted \u2013 \u201cI\ncan tell you I loved her, I\ncan tell you she loved me,\nwe was very close.\u201d Other\nthan this, neither have\nspoken about the marriage\npublicly (besides her court\nmotions).\nFor the record, the\nmarriage was annulled\nwhen Aaliyah\u2019s family\nfound out in 1995. She\nattempted to have the\nrecords expunged in 1997\n(these motions being the\nsmoking gun proving the\nmarriage happened). At\nthe time, another woman\nwas suing Kelly for having\nsex with her when she was\n15; he was 24. The case\nwas settled for $250,000.\nAaliyah tragically passed\nin a plane crash in 2001.\nShe was 22.\nThat\u2019s not all, folks. In\n2002, a tape surfaced of R.\nKelly having sex with and\nurinating on yet another\nteenager. Police seized his\ncamera and found twelve\npornographic pictures of\nunderage women. He was\nindicted on 21 counts of\nchild pornography; the\ncase was dismissed over a\ntechnicality relating to the\nsearch warrant \u2013 \u201clack of\nprobable cause.\u201d The trial\nrelated to the tape was\npostponed over and over\nagain by R. Kelly\u2019s legal\nteam, citing whatever\nwould push the date over\nthe horizon; eventually,\nin 2008, a jury cleared R.\nKelly, The Human Delay\nof Trial, of all counts.\nAnd now, the new\nallegations. Three sets\nof parents have come\nforward, alleging that R.\nKelly is holding women,\ntheir childre, in a \u201csex\ncult\u201d. One has come\nforward accusing him of\npurposefully infecting her\nwith an incurable sexu-ally-transmitted disease\nand refers to her case as\n\u201csexual enslavement.\u201d\nHorrid? Yes. Shocking?\nNo. The man\u2019s 51 \u2013 this is\na well-established pattern\nof behavior, whispered\nin the media, and legible\non his fucking Wikipedia\npage. These are Weinstein-esque patterns of\nturning a blind eye to the\nkinds of toxic behavior\nthat keep capable women\nout of music. Thank\nChrist for #MeToo \u2013 it\u2019s\nonly too easy to imagine\nthis behavior continuing\ninto perpetuity. Hopefully\nthe winds of change will\nblow R Kelley right into\nprison \u2013 or wherever else\nhis miserable ass will get\nsome comeuppance.\nFrom the Felix Music\nstaff, from deep within all\nour hearts \u2013 R.

For Fans Of: Kurt\nVile; Angel Olsen; Parquet\nCourts. 37 minutes\nTELL ME HOW YOU\nREALLY FEEL\nO\nn first listen,\nTell Me How\nYou Really Feel,\nthe long-antic-ipated new album from\nAustralian slacker-rock\nqueen Courtney Barnett\ncouldn\u2019t seem more different from her breakthrough\nSometimes I Sit and\nThink, and Sometimes I\nJust Sit. \u2018Hopefulessness\u2019,\nthe opening track, is a\nguitar-led dirge, with\nBarnett\u2019s flat vocals\npeering out from behind\nwaves of distorted strumming that reaches an apex\nin the song\u2019s conclusion.\nIt\u2019s a sharp contrast from\nher last album\u2019s opener\n\u2013 \u2018Elevator Operator\u2019, a\nsparky, upbeat tune that\ndisplayed all the usual\nqualities we\u2019ve come\nto expect from Barnett:\nsmart, witty lyrics;\nintricate guitar riffs; and a\nknack for catchy melody.\nWith the next track,\n\u2018City Looks Pretty\u2019,\nhowever, we\u2019re back into\nfamiliar Barnett territory,\nas she sings-speaks about\nday to day mundanities.\nThis classic formula is\nrepeated several times\nduringthealbum,although\nthere is definitely a sense\nthat, with this album,\nBarnett released all the\nbest tracks as singles,\nmeaning the remainder\nof the songs simply don\u2019t\nmeasure up. The bouncy\nrhythms of tracks like\n\u2018City Looks Pretty\u2019 and\n\u2018Charity\u2019 are intercut with\nheavier tracks, such as\nthe down-tempo \u2018Need a\nLittle Time\u2019, in an album\nthat is more introspective.\nThe album in general\nhas a much darker, more\nlayered sound than her\nprevious work: the guitars\nare scuzzier, the riffs\nmeatier, with a heightened\nfocus on melody over\nlyrics. This marks an important development for\nBarnett, but does seem to\ndetract from the qualities\nthat attracted so many\nof us to her in the first\nplace: her wicked sense\nof wordplay, and ability to\ncraft a slick lyric.\nTo be sure, there are\nsome classic lines to\nbe found on the album:\nBarnett is particularly\nadept at ironic juxtaposition (\u201cMeditation just\nmakes you more upset\u201d\non \u2018Charity\u2019) or canny\nmetaphors (indecision\n\u201crots like a bag of last\nweek\u2019s meat\u201d on the\npunchy \u2018Crippling Self\nDoubt and a General Lack\nof Confidence\u2019). And,\ndespite a general sense\nof vulnerability on the\nalbum, she\u2019s not afraid\nto deliver a kiss-off line,\nlike \u201cHe said \u2018I could eat\na bowl of alphabet soup/\nand spit out better words\nthan you\u2019/but you didn\u2019t\u201d\non the incredibly boppy\n\u2018Nameless Faceless\u2019.\n\u2018I\u2019m Not Your Mother,\nI\u2019m Not Your Bitch\u2019,\nwhich marks the midpoint of the album, is a\nsignificant sonic departure\nfor Barnett, her trademark\ndrawl replaced with something more akin to a sneer.\nIt also marks a turning\npoint for the album,\nwhich is front-loaded with\ncatchy tunes. From the\nmid-point onwards, the\ntracks become increasingly forgettable, closing\nout with a bizarre fade-out\non \u2018Sunday Roast\u2019, which\nsuddenly segues midway\nthrough from a rambling\ntrack to a sing-along\nchorus. It\u2019s a choice that\ndoesn\u2019t quite work, but\nstill leaves us looking\nforward to what Barnett\nwill bring next.\nYeah, but how do you really feel though? // Milk!\n\n"

Owen Rathbone,\nthe hastily-appointed Vice\nProvost (Do You Still\nWant To Hear From Us?),\ntold Hangman the move\nwas the right action to\ntake: \u201cwe were erring on\nthe side of caution, but it\ngot to Thursday morning,\nless than 24 hours before\nthe regulations came into\neffect, and we realised we\nstill don\u2019t really have any\nidea of what the fuck any\nof the new rules mean for\nus. Instead of running the\nrisk of being hit with the\nnew fines, we just decided\nto delete all data we hold.\u201d\nWhile the new regulations mainly cover\npersonal data, the College\ndecided to enact \u2018Project\nScorched Earth\u2019, deleting all email addresses,\nstudent and staff registry\ndata, and financial in-formation. The College\nsay they will now \u201cbegin\nagain from scratch,\ncreating a new institution\nin the mold of these regulations.\u201d\nThe move has had\na number of knock-on\neffects, however: earlier\nthis week, students were\ninformed their previous\nexam records had been\ndeleted, and they would\nneed to retake all their\nexaminations again.\nFlorence Mayhugh, a\nthird year physicist, told\nHangman how it had affected her: \u201cI really didn\u2019t\ndo that well in my first\nfew sets of exams, and I\nalways said I\u2019d love the\nchance to redo them, but\nthat was a load of bullshit.\nLet\u2019s be honest: I didn\u2019t\nknow the topics then, and\nI don\u2019t know them now.\u201d\nThe College Archive\nhas also been hit by the\ndestruction of data. Poppy\nEstby, the College\u2019s\narchivist, had her office\nransacked in the early\nhours of Friday morning:\n\u201cI kept getting these\nYou can\u2019t breach data protection laws if you\u2019ve for no data // CC\nemails asking whether\nmy archive was GDPR\ncompliant,\u201d Estby told\nHangman, \u201cand I just presumed they were spam, so\nI ignored them. But then\nI came in on Friday, and\nthe archive was just gone.\nCompletely empty.\u201d\nRathbone confirmed\nthe archive had been\ndestroyed, but was unable\nto tell Hangman what\nthe space would be used\nfor: \u201cThere are currently\na number of options for\nwhat we do with the\nspace; we\u2019re aware that\nthe counselling service is\nin need of more rooms,\nbut re-generating the College\u2019s data from scratch\nis going to be a big job.\nWe\u2019ll probably just move\nsome faculty staff there.\u201d\n\u201cStudents\nwere informed\ntheir previous\nexam records\nhas been\ndeleted, and\nthey would\nneed to retake\nthem\u201d\nARIES TAURUS GEMINI CANCER LEO VIRGO\nLIBRA SCORPIO SAGITTARIUS CAPRICORN AQUARIUS PISCES\nThis week you\u2019re the\nFelix Editor, and your\nHoroscopes Writer has\ntoo many exams to write\nfor the paper.

I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll\never get rid of the smell of\nchicken katsu curry from\nthe main entrance.\u201d\nThe move has shocked\nand dismayed some\nstudents.

    "content": "ARTS\nFRIDAY, 25TH\nMAY, 2018 FELIX\n12\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nA night of wicked cabaret takes us back in time\nT\nhis new collaboration between\nthe English\nNational Opera\nand Gate Theatre brings\ntogether a collection\nof songs from Weimar\nera Germany, banned\nby the Nazis for being\n\u2018un-German\u2019. The title\nitself is taken from a\nNazi document produced\nfor propagandist Hans\nZiegler\u2019s 1938 exhibition\nof these banned songs,\nintended to highlight their\ndegeneracy and justify\ntheir banning. Many of the\nsongs were by Jewish and\nblack musicians, as well\nas containing themes that\nran counter to Nazi ideals.\nEffigies of Wickedness features a selection of these\nsongs, performed in order\nof chronology, effectively\ncreating a journey through\ntime, starting in 1920 with\nsongs celebrating Weimar\nsubversion, through to\n1938 and the advent of\nthe Second World War.\nIt combines elements of\nopera, musical theatre,\nand cabaret in an ambitious effort to combine the\ngenres.\nThe production stars\nopera singers Peter\nBrathwaite and Katie\nBray, alongside actor/\nperformer Lucy McCormick, and cabaret star\nand drag performer Le\nGateau Chocolat. Whilst\nthey all deliver excellent\nperformances, their\ndifferent backgrounds\nare clear from the begin-ning. Whilst Bray and\nBrathwaite are clearly\namazing singers, their\nlack of cabaret experience\nis clear in their audience\ninteractions. Bray is brilliant in her duet of \u2018Best\nGirlfriends\u2019, a 1928 ode\nto lesbian love by Misha\nSpoliansky, but fades into\nthe background outside of\nher song performances.\nLisa McCormick is\nalmost the very opposite:\nshe starts out uneven \u2013\nthere is even a remark\nfollowing her duet with\nBray in \u2018Best Girlfriends\u2019\nthat this \u2018isn\u2019t her strongest number\u2019 \u2013 but as the\nwe progress further in\ntime, towards the 1930s\nand darker subject matter,\nshe really comes into her\nown. Her performance\nof the song \u2018Paragraph\n218 (Abortion is Illegal)\u2019\nabout a young woman\nbeing denied an abortion\ndespite being almost des-titute, is one of the most\nhaunting and powerful\nperformances of the night.\nThe clear star of the show,\nhowever, is Le Gateau\nChocolat, who stands\nout in almost every per-formance, transitioning\neffortlessly from comic\nto saucy, and, towards the\nend of the night, to tragic\nfigure. Its almost impossible to focus on any of the\nother performers when Le\nGateau Chocolat is dominating the stage.\nThe staging of the\nshow is in some ways the\nweakest link in this pro-duction. The Gate Theatre\nis an unusual location,\nnotable mainly for its\nsmall size and somewhat\nclaustrophobic seating\narrangement. This is\nreferenced by the stars on\nmore than one occasion,\nwith remarks comparing\nit to a \u2018cupboard\u2019 and Lisa\nMcCormick\u2019s joke on it\nbeing a far cry from the\nENO\u2019s usual home at The\nColiseum.\nWhat the jokes say are\ntrue though, and the production really is rather let\ndown by its venue \u2013 the\nstage is small, and limits\nwhat the cast can do, especially as they are joined\nby their musicians on the\nstage.\nIts shiny black design,\nand the jumble of props\nat centre stage, are a\nbrave choice, but one that\ndoesn\u2019t pay off. If the aim\nwas to capture the air of a\nlocation in 1920s Berlin,\nit fails miserably and\ncomes across more like\nthe stage of an amateur\nperformance. It has one\nadvantage though: it\ncreates a sense of intimacy\nwith the performers,\nenhanced by the performers\u2019 interactions with the\naudience. The interactions\nwith the musicians does\nalso go towards capturing\nwhat might have been the\natmosphere of a 1920s\nBerlin bar. Even so, you\ncan\u2019t help but think that\nsuch an ambitious collaboration is worthy of a\nlarger venue.\nOverall, I wasn\u2019t sure\nwhat to make of this\nproduction. It combines\nopera, cabaret, and\ndramatic theatre together\nto create something\nalmost wholly new. This\nfeels like a mishmash, but\nan intentional one, and\nthe combination of genres\nand artforms perhaps adds\nto the spirit of subversion\nit is trying to capture. It\u2019s\na bold endeavour and one\nthat pays off: it succeeds in\ncombining the genres into\none enjoyable evening. If\nyou\u2019re a fan of cabaret,\nopera, or just fancy something different, then a trip\nto this production at Gate\nTheatre is definitely one\nworth taking.\nThe collaboration between ENO and the Gate Theatre brings together a set of songs banned by the Nazis for\nbeing \u2018un-German\u2019 \u2013 it\u2019s a fantastical evening, which deserves a bigger setting.\nENO and the Gate Theatre: Effigies of Wickedness, Le Gateau Chocolat // Helen Murray\nARTS\nVaishnavi\nGnanananthan\nArts Writer\nWhere?

This\ncommences from the earliest of ages \u2013 from when\nwe learn to brush our teeth\nin the morning, to sleeping at a particular time\nat night. With the advent\nof modern technology,\nchecking our phones has\nalso become embedded in\nour everyday lives. Many\nsay this is an example of\nhow anti-social we are all\nbecoming. Never is this\nmore evident than on the\ntube in London, as many\ntravellers stare intently at\ntheir phones, as opposed\nto engaging in conversa-tion. This phenomenon\nhas been described as\npuzzling by many for-eigners, so-much-so that\none American man took\nmatters into his own\nhands and created a badge\nlabelled, \u201cTube chat?,\u201d to\nget us talking! As expect-ed, this was not received\nwell at all, with a counter\nbadge marked, \u201cNo chat\nplease, we\u2019re British,\u201d\nbeing created.\nhaviour, many would say\nsome action needs to be\ntaken. Controversially, it\nhas also been argued that\nphones have made humans\nmore social, as we are able\nto communicate with individuals on the other side\nof the globe \u2013 an option\npreviously unavailable to\nour ancestors. Although\nthe population spends a\ngreat deal of time on their\nphones, this phenomenon\nmay just be an example\nof how addicted we are to\nsocial interactions, further\nexemplifying the fundamental desire of humans\nwishing to connect with\none another. This can be\ntraced back through evo-lution: we have developed\nto become a distinctively\nsocial species that requires\nconstant input, not only\nfrom our surroundings,\nbut from other humans,\nto guide appropriate\nlanguage and behaviour.\nConsequently, this enables\nhumans to find a sense of\nidentity and meaning, as\nwell as creating a specific\ngoal!\nFollowing a review\nof literature on the dysfunctional use of smart\ntechnology, using an\nevolutionary perspective,\nMoriah Stendel and\nProfessor Veissi\u00e8re from\nMcGill University concluded the following: a\nmutual theme shared by\nthe most addictive smartphone functions was the\nabilityto tap into the desire\nof humans to connect with\nother humans!

Thus,\nSolar cells absorb 20% more light with nanoscale\ncoating\nThe efficiency of solar cells has received a big boost from a tiny source.\nSCIENCE\nLara Bailey\nScience Writer\nR\nesearchers at\nthe National\nInstitute of\nStandards and\nTechnology (NIST) have\ndeveloped a nanoscale\ncoating for solar cells.\nThese are made of thousands of glass beads of\nsulphur dioxide, each no\nlarger than one-hundredth\nof the width of a human\nhair.\nThe coating creates\nan optical \u2018whispering\ngallery\u2019 effect around\neach solar cell. Acoustic\nwhispering galleries\nare curved structures,\nwhereby a person at one\nend of a wall can hear\na faint noise from any\npart of the wall. When\nlight hits the beads, the\nwaves travel around its\nentire shape, in the same\nway that sound waves\ntravel around a curved\nwall. This traps the light,\nand so creates a more\nconcentrated light source.\nThe light then seeps out\nto be absorbed by a solar\ncell composed of gallium\nResults indicated\nthat coated solar cells\nabsorbed 20% more light\nand produced 20% more\ncurrent than uncoated\ncells. As a laser was used\nas a light source, it is still\nyet to be seen whether\nthe same results can be\nproduced outside of the\nlab in solar panels. Nevertheless, this is a crucial\nstep for renewable energy\ntechnology.\nThe development is\neven more impressive\nconsidering that the researchers have prepared\nthe technology for mass\nproduction. Previous\nmethods of applying\ncoating to solar cells\ninvolved incredibly high\ntemperatures, making\nthe process expensive.\nTypical methods are also\ntime-consuming as both\nsides of the solar cell are\ncoated when only one\nis necessary. The new\nmethod involves applying\nthe nanoscale coating to\nonly one side of the cell.\nA wire-wound metal rod\nis then pulled across the\ncell, so that the coating\nbecomes spread out, and\nso the tiny glass beads are\nmore tightly packed. This\ncan take place at room\ntemperature, lowering\nproduction costs consid-erably.\nThis development\nhelps pave the way for\nhigh-efficiency and\nlow-cost solar cells.\n\u201cResults\nindicated that\ncoated solar\ncells absorbed\n20% more\nlight and\nproduced 20%\nmore current\u201d\narsenide.\nThe breakthrough could pave the way for higher-efficiency cells // CC\n\n"

Boiling\nwater in the kettle saves lots of time!\n5. Wait until only half of the tofu is submerged in water. Pour in half of the starch\nwater. You can do this by slowly pouring\nthe starch water along the circumference of\nthe pan. Wait for another five minutes and\nadd the remaining starch water.\n6. Taste the tofu and sprinkle over the\ngreen onions. It\u2019s up to you when you want\nto stop heating.

It\nis also a perfect vegetarian\nor vegan choice if you add\nno mince into it. There\nare several variations of\nMapo Tofu, including a\nJapanese version, which is\nwell known as one of the\nspiciest meals there.\n\u2018Mapo Tofu\u2019 is named\nafter an old lady, nicknamed \u2018Mapo\u2019 (\u2018an old\nwoman with pockmarked\nface\u2019 in Chinese) in\nSzechuan who owned a\nsmall and inconspicuous\nrestaurant.

There is\na number of reasons for\ntheir decline in recent\ntimes, such as the loss\nof habitats and the use of\npesticides, which has reduced the amount of prey\navailable in an area. One\nfactor which you may\nnot be aware of, however,\nis that of hunting. Every\nspring and autumn on the\nislands of Malta there is a\nhunt, in which thousands\nof migrating birds are shot\nover the Mediterranean\nislands. This is not the\nonly place where songbirds are at risk: a large\nnumber of species have\ndisappeared from the wild\nin south-east Asia, where\nbirds have been collected\nto supply the pet trade.\nBetween spring and\nautumn, thousands of\nbirds migrate between\nEurope and their wintering grounds in Africa.\nThe Maltese Islands are a\nvital point in each bird\u2019s\njourney, acting as a stopover point, where they can\ngather food and water; as\nwell as the chance to rest,\nbefore or after facing the\nseemingly impossible task\nof crossing the Sahara\nDesert. Malta opens a\nhunting season targeting\nbirds en route to (or from)\ntheir breeding grounds, at\na time when they are most\nvulnerable. Among the\nbirds that are targeted are\nspecies rapidly disappearing in the UK \u2013 such as\nthe Turtle Dove \u2013 but also\nbirds of prey such as the\nMarsh Harrier. Despite the\nfact that rare species are\nprotected in the Maltese\nIslands, many are illegally\nshot each year during the\nhunting seasons.\nRecently, Springwatch\npresenter and avid naturalist Chris Packham\nwas detained by police\nfor trying to learn more\nabout the hunts whilst\nfilming a documentary on\nthe subject. After an altercation whilst filming an\ninterview, Packham was\ndetained for more than\nthree hours at a police\nstation, before being later\ncharged. Despite the fact\nthat the aggressors in the\nscenario were breaking\nthe law by keeping caged\nbirds, the police sided\nwith them. This obviously\nhighlights a significant\nunderlying issue, one\nthat will be a tough to\ndeal with, as this requires\nchanging the behaviour\nand lifestyles of not only\nthe hunters, but also the\nlocal police to ensure\nwildlife protection laws\nare enforced properly. The\nonly way to help prevent\nthis in the future is to\nput our foot down and\nlet the Maltese government know that it is\nunacceptable to carry on\nlike this, both as a nation\nand as an international\ncommunity.\nThe Marsh Harrier is one of the species at risk from hunting // CC\nConnect with Conservation: Malta bird massacre\nGetting down with the kids\nW\nho doesn\u2019t\nlove choco-late? While\nyou and\nI might enjoy its taste\nfreely, there are 80,000\nchildren each year who\nare unable to do so. The\nreason: they suffer from\ntype 1 diabetes, which\nmanifests itself at an early\nage. Unlike type 2 dia-betes, which comes into\neffect at an old age, due to\nthe pancreas slowly losing\nits ability to produce\nenough insulin, type 1 diabetes has genetic origins\nleaving patients needing\nto constantly monitoring\ntheir food habits from\nchildhood.\nThe presence of\ndiabetes within an individual can be attributed\nto a combination of both\nnature and nurture.\nHowever, the genetic\ncauses (nature) far trumps\npersonal habits (nurture)\nas the leading cause of\ntype 1 diabetes. This\nmakes the dangers of type\n1 diabetes particularly\ndifficult: since its onset\noccurs in childhood, there\ncan be a high risk of a\nreduction in life expectan-cy; and since the pancreas\nmalfunctions, and is\nunable to make insulin,\nthere is far less tolerance\nfor hyperglycaemic\nattacks compared to type\n2 patients.\nDue to its high incidence and mortality risk,\nit is important to have an\nearly diagnosis, ensuring\ncorrect interventions\nare provided in a timely\nfashion. The presence of a\nfamily history of diabetes\nis considered a \u201cred\nflag,\u201d and puts children at\nhigher risk of developing\nthe condition. However,\nit is neither a perfect\nindicator nor a necessary\ncondition for diabetes to\ndevelop. Therefore, to\ntackle this issue, scientists\nfrom Helmholtz Zentrum\nM\u00fcnchen developed a\nSCIENCE\nVarshit Dusad\nScience Writer\n\u201cgenetic score\u201d to identify\nif an infant possess the\nrisk of type 1 diabetes\nwith no family history of\nthe condition. The study\nwas conducted over ten\nyears, with more than\n3000 children monitored\nsince their infancy, that\nwere followed up every\nthree to six months.\nThe researchers used\ngenetic information from\nmultiple sequences of\nDNA associated with\ndiabetes risks to create a\nmore reliable metric to\npredict the risk of developing the condition. By\nusing this score, it will be\npossible to sort infants for\nearly-stage interventions,\nwhich could enhance both\nthe quality of life and\nlife expectancy of these\nchildren. The scientists\nare confident in the re-al-world applicability of\ntheir research and have\nfiled a patent based on this\ngenetic score.\nThe life of a diabetic\npatient can be a difficult\none, with the slightest\nnegligence having the\npotential to turn into a\nlife-threatening accident.\nThe lack of a direct causal\nunderstanding of the\norigin of type 1 diabetes\nmakes the matter even\ntrickier. Hopefully, using\nthis advanced genetic\nscoring, further improvements along this line can\nforge the way for individ-ualised medicine \u2013 where\npatients can be treated\naccording to their specific\nneeds based on their\nunique genetic footprint.\nType I Diabetes can be a life-threatening condition that strikes the young. New scientific developments suggest\nwe might be able to look to genetics to see who is most at risk.\nRegular tests can be needed in diabetes // Flickr/Alisha\nVargas\n\n"

We encounter\nnewly-weds Florence\n(Saoirse Ronan) and\nEdward (Billy Howle)\nright at the beginning of\nDominic Cooke\u2019s film,\nand \u2013 shortly after sitting\nthrough the post-wedding\ndinner from hotel hell \u2013\nthey start to get it on. Or,\nat least they try. Things\ndon\u2019t reach a climax\n\u2013 both physically and\nemotionally \u2013 until about\neighty minutes later, by\nwhich time the film, and\nthe audience, has lost any\nsense of excitement.\nInterspersed between\nthis fumbling and tugging\nand stalling is the story\nof two lives, slowly but\nsurely coming together;\nthrough flashbacks, we\nfollow Florence and\nEdward as they make their\nway towards each other\nfrom radically different\nbackgrounds. Florence is\nthe upper-class daughter\nof an academic (played\nwith haughty excellence\nby Emily Watson, who\nmanages to deliver lines\nlike \u201cI heard her on the\nphone to Iris Murdoch\u201d as\nif it were the most natural\nthing in the world) and a\nfactory-owner; she\u2019s just\ngraduated from the Royal\nCollege of Music, wants\nto make it big with her\nstring quintet, and \u2013 for\nthe standards of the time\nand milieu \u2013 is a bit of a\nradical, attending CND\nmeetings in her spare\ntime.\nIt is at one of these\nmeetings that she meets\nEdward, a bright man from\nless well-off backgrounds,\nwho has just finished at\nUCL (\u201cBut that\u2019s London.\nFor sons of tradesmen,\u201d\nFlorence\u2019s mother cries).\nHis mother, played by\nthe brilliant Anne-Marie\nDuff, is an artistic, eccentric woman, whose life is\nupended when she\u2019s hit\nby a moving train door,\nleaving her \u2018brain-damaged\u2019. It\u2019s a moment of\nshocking violence that has\nrepercussions throughout\nthe film, although Cooke\ndoesn\u2019t go far enough in\nexploring the impact it\u2019s\nhad on Edward.\n\u201cThe\nscreenplay\ncreates a\nthree-part\nstructure\nout of a film\nthat can only\nsustain a\nsingle act\u201d\nThe two meet, fall in\nlove, get married, and\nthen\u2026 an inability for\nFlorence to have sex\ndrives a wedge between\nthem, leading to a shouting\nmatch on the shingles of\nChesil Beach. The reasons\nbehind this refusal, which\nEdward terms frigidity,\nare hinted at throughout\nthe film, although in the\nprocess it seems to insist\nthe behaviour necessitates\nan explanation, and that\nthis explanation must be\ntraumatic.\nThe film sticks closely\nto the original book, with\nIan McEwan even serving\nas the film\u2019s screenwriter.\nIt\u2019s understandable, but\na pity, since it creates a\nthree-part structure out of\na film that realistically can\nonly sustain a single act.\nWhilethefilmhasanatural\ncut-off point, leaving the\ncouple alone and isolated\non the beachfront, it\ninstead follows them up\nthrough the decades, as\nEdward and Florence\nlose their youthful joie\nde vivre, and gain heavy\nageing prosthetics. The\nresult is a film which falls\napart in the last half-hour,\nundermining the careful\nsense of time and place\ncreated at the beginning\nof the film. It also serves\nto dampen down the\nemotional poignancy\ngenerated in the beach\nscenes, instead replacing\nit with something much\nmore close-ended and\nhackneyed.\nThe cast give it their\nall, however. Ronan is,\nas usual, excellent in the\nfilm, perfectly capturing\nthe mid-century British\naccent of the upper crust,\nall clipped vowels and\nrestraint. Her Florence\nis hesitant and unsure of\nherself, particularly in the\nexcruciating sex scene,\nwhich reportedly took a\nweek to film, but Ronan\nis able to turn on a dime,\nswitching from emotional\nvulnerability to hard steel.\nIt\u2019s difficult, however,\nwhen comparing it to\nher last performance, in\nGreta Gerwig\u2019s majestic\nLady Bird, to not miss\nthe impressive naturalism\nof the film\u2019s screenplay;\nOn Chesil Beach, in\ncomparison, seems stilted\nand disjointed. Howle\nmanages to hold his own\nagainst Ronan, although\nhe on occasion oversells\nthe blustery, impulsive\nnature of his character.\nCooke\u2019s main experience is in directing for the\nstage, and it shows here:\nthe action is frequently\nstilted, with numerous\nsection appearing more\nlike a televised play than\nan actual film. While\ncinematographer Sean\nBobbitt, who is best\nknown for his work with\nSteve McQueen, manages\nto capture the majestic\nbeauty of the English\nlandscape, things all too\noften veer away from\nnaturalism and into a\nmore formalist style of\nfilm-making.\nIt seems apropos that,\nfrom a book all about\nfrustrated desires and\ncontainment, we get a film\nthat is itself frustrating\nand contained. On Chesil\nBeach seems to waste its\nbrilliant cast on a drama\nthat is lacking in emotional power, and weighted\ndown by a turgid ending;\nwhile there are moments\nwhere it manages to hit\nthe mark, they\u2019re few and\nfar between in the overlong film.\nA stock photo of every family beach holiday ever // Lionsgate\nFILM\nFred Fyles\nEditor-in-Chief\nDir:DominicCooke.Script:\nIan McEwan.

Felix sport\u2019s guide to little known high-In early February 2018 Sports Editor Imraj Singh went to try out Futsal with Imperial\u2019s own squad.\nSPORTS\nImraj Singh\nSports Editor\nHarry Lanz\nFutsal correspondent\nF\nutsal is a bit of\na rogue sport:\none of the rare\nbeauties with a\ncult following. Relatively\nunknown in the UK, it\nhas larger audiences in\nArgentina, Brazil, Spain,\nand Portugal \u2013 countries\nwhich have spawned\nsome of the best football\nplayers in the world. That\nis no coincidence. The\nlikes of Pel\u00e9, Neymar,\nRonaldinho, Messi,\nCristiano Ronaldo, Xavi,\nences. For a start the ball\nis different: it\u2019s smaller,\nwith a size 4 ball used as\nopposed to the size 5 used\nin football. Additionally,\na Futsal ball has about\n30% less bounce than\nits counterpart, and is\nalso heavier. This means\nthat it\u2019s both harder to\nkick and to control, and\nplayers must exhibit more\nskill. In addition, teams\nare five a side, the pitches\nand goals are smaller, the\nplaying surface is solid \u2013\na basketball court rather\nthan a football field \u2013 and\nthe rules are designed\nto speed up game play.\nLike a condensed version\nof football, where things\nhappen faster, with\nfutsal you are constantly\nmoving, and must shift,\nflow, and ebb with your\nteammates synchronously\nand at high speed. At least\nthat was my experience\u2026\nFor a heavy-footed,\nunder-exercised Sports\nEditor the prospect\nof Futsal was rather\ndaunting. I knew I would\nbe bad, it was just a matter\nof how bad. I played\nfootball through primary\nschool, and, with coaching\nfrom my brother, even\nmanaged to score a hattrick whilst playing for\nour school\u2019s third team.\n\u201cThe likes of\nPele, Neymar,\nRonaldinho,\nMessi,\nCristiano\nRonaldo, Xavi,\nand Ronaldo\nall have their\nroots entwined\nwith futsal\u201d\n\u201cYou are\nconstantly\nmoving, and\nmust shift,\nflow, and ebb\nwith your\nteammates\nsynchronously\nand at high\nspeed\u201d\nThese experiences left me\nill prepared for my time\nwith Imperial futsal. The\ncaptain kindly allowed\nme to give the sport a go,\ndespite the fact one of\ntheir most hotly anticipated games was just around\nthe corner. IC futsal were\ntop-of-their-league and in\ncontention for promotion;\ntheir players were at the\nheight of their season,\nplaying better than ever.\nIf there was ever a time\nto be publicly humiliated\nthis was it. Sheepishly\nmoving through Ethos\nat the heels of my Aero\nhusband (Harry Lanz, the\nmost uncoordinated man\nalive, who has played\nFutsal throughout his time\nat Imperial), I joined the\nsquad in the changing\nrooms. Quickly my\nnerves relaxed. The casual\nchat, friendly faces, and\nwelcoming demeanour of\nall the bois was lovely,\nActually that\u2019s a bit wet:\nit was just normal. Just\nthe bois looking forward\nto kicking a ball about\nfor the next two hours.\nI began to realize I was\nunnecessarily stressing.\nAround 25 people\ncame along to the training\nsession, which was held\nin the Ethos sports hall\n\u2013 about average for the\nteam. Prior to warm-up\nwe took some shots at goal\nand I entered a circle of\nfolk playing a keepy-upie\ngame. Naturally I was\nthe liability and allowed\nthe ball to touch the floor\nwhenever it was given to\nme bar once... The few\n\u2018fans\u2019 looked down from\nEthos\u2019 gym in disappoint-ment. I was ready.\nAfter warm-up, the\nteam would normally go\ninto a skill-based training,\nshooting, passing, and\nball control drills, but\nthis time it was decided\nthat we would all split off\ninto teams and go straight\ninto games. Terrified, I\nwas handed a yellow bib\nand Harry was put in the\nunfortunate situation of\nbeing my teammate. Prior\nto the game, all players\nwere given a demonstration of some tactics.\nAs there are only four\noutfield players (and one\ngoalkeeper) these are different from football, with\nthe team loosely divided\ninto two offensive and\ntwo defensive players.\nI say \u201cloosely\u201d: after\nwatching other teams play\nI noticed the fluidity of the\ngame, a side-effect of the\nsmall pitch. The ability to\nhave very fast counterattacks means that there is\nconstant running for the\nduration of the five-minute\ngames we played. Players\nhad to be very well-round-ed; defenders were found\nshooting, and offensive\nplayer defended. When\nI did play I found I fully\nappreciated the pace of\nthe game. It\u2019s the sort of\nblink-and-you\u2019ll-miss-it\nof attack, counter-attack,\nAND hat-trick speed of\nplay. But those who play\naren\u2019t super human. I was\ngiven advice by my peers\nthroughout the matches.\nI felt I was getting better\nfrom game to game.

To\nspeak of television as\n\u2018neutral\u2019 and therefore\nsubject to change is as\nabsurd as speaking of the\nreform of a technology\nsuch as guns.\u201d\nI would like to propose\na fifth argument for the\nelimination of television:\nthe existence of the TV\nshow Nailed It! The series\n\u2013 which must be the first\nexample of a television\nseries being inspired\nsolely by a meme \u2013 sees\nthree amateur bakers\nattempt to construct complicated culinary creations\nwhile host Amanda Byer\nprovides gently sarcastic commentary. The\nemphasis is on \u2018amateur\u2019,\nrather than \u2018baker\u2019: unlike\nThe Great British Bake\nOff, where contestants can\nknock up a dozen perfect\nmacarons in their sleep,\nthe people brought on in\nNailed It! are home cooks\nthrough and through.\nCakes are iced warm, tiers\ncollapse, and the sugar\nsculptures look like something from House of Wax.\nNailed It! is, as you\nmay have guessed, a\nNetflix original \u2013 one of\nthe roughly 700 films\nand TV programmes the\nstreaming giant plans\nto release this year. The\ncost of bringing this\nsheer amount of content\nto the provider\u2019s 104\nmillion global subscribers\nis no small feat: their\ncontent budget for this\nyear currently stands at\naround $8 billion, roughly\nequivalent to the GDP of\nHaiti. A large proportion\nof this money will go\non the service\u2019s flagship\nproductions, such as\nmonarchy-based drama\nThe Crown, whose first\nseason cost a reported\n$130 million to make.\nThis growth has\nanother cost, however,\nand that is the deluge of\ntrite, dull, trashy shows\nthat are currently flooding\nour screens. Series like\nBojack Horseman and\nfilms like Alex Garland\u2019s\nAnnihilation are like\npieces of flotsam amid a\ntidal wave of mediocrity,\nand, as Netflix is increasingly aggressive in its\npursuit of original content,\nit seems likely things will\nonly worsen.\nHow did we get to this\nposition? Just a few short\nyears ago, Netflix seemed\nto be the salvation for\nTV in the modern age,\na platform that could\nfund and promote high\nquality content to fill our\nscreens. Netflix\u2019s first\nbreakthrough \u2013 six years\nafter they began offering\nstreamed content \u2013 was\nwith the release of the\nfirst series of House of\nCards, which was their\nfirst original piece of\nprogramming. While they\nhad previously been satisfied with merely being\na platform for the work\nof others, with House of\nCards they began to shape\ntheir image as major television producers.\nThey swiftly followed\nthis up with Orange is the\nNew Black, an ensemble\ndrama about incarcerated\nwomen that married\nshowrunner Jenji Kohan\u2019s\nbold, colourful vision with\nintersectional feminism.\nThose two shows, alone,\ngarnered eleven Emmy\nawards, and two Golden\nGlobes for Netflix.\nAt the time, these\nshows seemed to mark a\nturning point for the television industry coming\nalong just as we were\nbeginning to reach the\nend of the golden age of\nTV. The series of tragic\nprestige dramas, most\nnotably embodied in\nThe Sopranos, had their\nfinal hurrah with AMC\u2019s\nmasterpiece Mad Men,\nwhich remains a reference\npoint for high-quality,\nslow-burn television.\nAs we bid farewell to\nDonald Draper and Peggy\nOlsen, however, there was\nconcern over what might\ncome next, and streaming\nservices stepped in to fill\nthe void. Indeed, going\nback to a little under a\ndecade ago, we seemed\nto be on the precipice of\na new cultural landscape:\nwater cooler discussions\nwere being replaced with\nbinge-watching, Twitter\nprovided a new platform\nfor real-time critiquing,\nand the phrase \u2018Netflix\nand chill\u2019 entered into our\nshared lexicon. In 2015\nand 2016, the Pulitzer\nPrize for Criticism was\nawarded to TV critics,\nseemingly cementing\nthe central role TV was\nhaving on the entertainment landscape.\nThere is no doubt that\nthis second wind can be\nattributed to streaming\nservices; while Netflix\nplanted the flag, becoming\nmost closely associated\nwith the new generation of\nprestige dramas, Amazon\nStudios and Hulu were\nquick on its heels, with\nseries like Transparent\nand The Handmaid\u2019s Tale\npicking up accolades left,\nright, and centre.\nWhat Nailed It!\nshows, however, is how\nthis relationship has\nsoured, and the promised\ngolden age has become\nan ever-receding dream.\nHow did we get from Mad Men and The Sopranos\u2026 // AMC/HBO\n\u201cThe main\nquestion\nNailed It!\nprompts is\nwhy does such\na show exist\nin the first\nplace?\u201d\n\u201cStreaming\nservices are\nchanneling\ntheir resources\ninto making\nsure every click\nis directed\ntowards self-produced\ncontent\u201d\nAs Netflix increasingly\npivot to self-produced\ncontent, works of true\nquality are becoming\nharder to make out: in\nreturn for The Crown,\nwe have to have The Get\nDown (cancelled after a\nsingle drawn-out season);\nfor every Unbreakable\nKimmy Schmidt there is a\nGirlboss (described as \u2018so\nunrelentingly tone-deaf\nto the human condition\nit\u2019s hard to know where\nto start\u2019); and meanwhile\ngood quality shows like\nMidnight Diner: Tokyo\nStories get pushed off the\nlanding page.\nAnd this isn\u2019t even\nbeginning to consider the\nimpact streaming services\nare having on the film\nindustry. In particular, the\nCannes Film Festival has\nbeen waging a war against\nNetflix, last year announcing all films screening in\nthe festival would need to\nhave a theatrical distribution in French cinemas; in\nresponse, Netflix pulled\nall their entries from this\nyear\u2019s festival, including\nthose that didn\u2019t fall under\nthe distribution rules.\nDavid Sims, staff writer\nfor The Atlantic, has\ncalled Netflix\u2019s corporate\nstrategy \u201caggressive\nand unusual even for a\nstreaming company\u201d,\nbut has predicted Cannes\nwill soon cave in, facing\nthe sheer glut of Netflix\nreleases, which is consistently growing.\nThis mania isn\u2019t helped\nby the lack of comprehensive data on what exactly\npeople are watching,\nwhich can make it increasingly difficult to decide\nwhat to watch. Netflix has\nbeen notoriously secretive\nabout what exactly its\ncustomers are watching\n\u2013 Nielsen previously\nannounced a new service\nto measure how many\npeople were watching\nepisodes of individual\nTV shows on streaming\nservices, but Netflix were\nquick to point out the\ndata were \u201cnot accurate,\nnot even close, and do\nnot reflect the viewing of\nthese shows on Netflix.\u201d\nIt is unclear whether\nNetflix wants to hide these\nviewing figures in order to\ngain a competitive edge\nover the competition, to\nhelp hide which shows are\nperforming poorly, or for\nany other reason. Earlier\nthis year, a report was\nreleased by 7Park Data,\nwhich claimed Netflix\noriginals only made up\nabout 20% of viewing\nfigures on the platform,\nwith the remainder being\npeople watching licensed\ncontent, which Netflix\nhas purchased from other\nproducers. Netflix refused\nto comment.\nWhat this secrecy does\nmean, is that it\u2019s increasingly difficult for the\naverage viewer to decide\nwhat to watch. Previously,\nTV addicts could look to\nthe ratings to see which\nshows were getting the\nlargest audiences, and\nwould be worth their time\n\u2013 of course, popularity\ndoesn\u2019t directly correlate\nto quality, but it can be a\ngood proxy, allowing us\nto know what we should\nsee to keep up with the\nchanging cultural land-scape. Today, viewers\nneed to rely on positive\nwrite-ups in papers or on\nwebsites, or on recommendations through social\nmedia, to know what they\nshould be tuning into.\nThis, combined with\nthe sheer quantity of\nprogrammes now avail-able, puts the viewer in a\nvulnerable position, with\never-increasing choice\nand an ever-diminishing\nability to tell the wheat\nfrom the chaff.\nNetflix has exploited\nthat gulf: as soon as you\nnavigate to the Netflix\nwebsite, you\u2019re greeted\nwith an advert for\nwhatever Netflix Original\nthey\u2019re currently plugging\n(at the time of writing it\u2019s\nDear White People, the\nsatirical college series,\nbased off the slight-ly-shaky film of the same\nname by Justin Simien).\nScroll down, and you\u2019re\npresented with another\nraft of Netflix Originals\nto pick from; as you keep\non scrolling down, and\nthe categories get more\ncomplex, you\u2019re almost\nalways guarenteed to\nsee the little red \u2018Netflix\u2019\ndenoting original content\nat multiple points on the\nscreen.\nThe question that this\nbrings us back to, then,\nespecially when considering that quality of shows\nlike Nailed It! is whether\nor not the programmes\nNetflix are pushing are\nbecause they\u2019re suited\nto us, or simply because\nthey\u2019re made by Netflix.\nIn an effort to stay ahead\nof the tough competition,\nthe streaming services are\nchanneling their resources\ninto making sure every\nclick, hit, or view is\ndirected towards content\nthey produce and own.\nAnd the result is diminishing returns for us \u2013 the\nconsumers.\nNetflix needs to take\na break, and decide what\nkind of platform it wants\nto be, rather than trying to\nbe all things at once. But,\nwith Barack Obama currently in talks to produce\nshows for Netflix, it\nseems unlikely the stream\nof content will ever stop.\n\u2026to Girlboss and Nailed It!? // Netflix\nNailed It! isn\u2019t a particularly bad show. It\u2019s\nwell-meaning and warm,\nwearing its game show\nformat lightly. But as a\npiece of programming, the\nmain question it prompts\nis why? Why does such a\nshow exist? Who pitched\nit to Netflix, and why was\nit funded? Buoyed on by\nthe success of their early\nshows, Netflix seems\ndesperate to replicate\nthe success of its early\ndays, but rather than\nchanneling their ever-in-creasing reserves into a\nfew choice projects, they\nare spreading it among as\nmany things as possible,\nhoping some will make it\nbig on the off chance. The\nresult is chaotic. With new\nshows and films being\nreleased every week, it\u2019s\nparadoxically more and\nmore difficult for the\nviewer to find stuff worth\nwatching; we\u2019re like\nBuridan\u2019s ass, trapped in\nfront of an endless sea of\nchoice, but paralysed into\nindecision.\n\n"

This is due\nto all the reviews we\nsee, hear, or read about\nbefore or straight after\na product\u2019s release. Our\nbrains are more likely to\nthink something is good if\nwe\u2019re told that it is good\nbeforehand. This is something that\u2019s been called\nthe anchoring effect.\nIn a study done after\nthe release of Plants vs.\nZombies, different groups\nof people were told that\nthe game was either\nreviewed well or poorly\nby critics. After playing\nthe game themselves, the\nvolunteers who were told\nit got good reviews gave\nit a higher score than\nthose who were told it got\n\u201cWe want to\nmake sure\nwe get our\nmoney\u2019s\nworth\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a good\ndeal to buy a\ngame on sale\nif you\u2019re not\ngoing to play\nit \u201d\nthey hear so many good\nthings about.\ngame is worth buying and\nplaying.\nWith the reviews, we\nalready form a notion of\nwhat the game is going\nto be like and use it to\nshape our actions forward.\nHowever, this behaviour\ndoesn\u2019t just apply to\nreviews but also to things\nlike Steam sales and game\nbundle deals. If a game is\non sale for a price between\n\u00a340-60, we\u2019re only likely\nto buy it if we\u2019re massive\nfans of the series or if we\nknow for sure that this is a\ngame we\u2019re going to play\nand don\u2019t want to wait for.\nHowever, if a \u00a350 game\nwas on sale for \u00a310, a lot\nof people would see this\nas a good deal and buy the\ngame, even if they might\nnot have had a very strong\ninterest in it beforehand.\nThe original price forms\na preconceived notion of\nthe game\u2019s value in our\nheads. So when we see the\nreduced price and statements such as \u201c75% off!\u201d,\nwe rationalise buying the\ngame as us making good\non a deal, on a price that\nwas already formed in our\nhead.\nBut was buying the\nreduced price game\nreally a good deal? A lot\nof games we buy from\nSteam sales usually just\nlie around in our games\nlibrary. In the same way\nthat it\u2019s not a good deal to\nbuy a fully priced game\nand not play it, it\u2019s not a\ngood deal to buy a game\non sale if you\u2019re not going\nto play it or experience it\nyourself. It\u2019s like buying\na movie ticket but never\ngoing to see the movie.\nIt\u2019s a trap so many of us\nfall into time and time\nagain.\nGame developers\nuse these preconceived\nnotions to their advantage.\nJust like how they\u2019re strategic about which reviewers they let play the game\nfirst hand, they\u2019re also\nusually strategic about\nhow they price the game.\nSometimes they price a\ngame or its bundles and\nDLC higher than it should\nbe, so more people buy it\nduring a sale. They also\nmake a point of showing\nhow much you save by\nbuying different or larger\nbundles of the game;\nthat\u2019s them setting a preconceived notion in your\nhead for how things are.\nThis phenomenon is\neverywhere, it affects\nyour gaming experience,\nit may drain your wallet\nand it helps form review\nscores. Knowing it exists\nmight not be enough for\nyou to be immune to it,\nbut if you keep your eye\nopen, you just might be\nable to spot it in action.\nSteam sales drain gamers\u2019wallets faster than Imperial drains happiness // Valve\nSaad Ahmed\nGames Editor\nGAMES\nA good review makes all the difference // Mr Seb\nnegative reviews.\nAccording to the anchoring effect, we base\nall our opinions on the\nfirst piece of data we hear\nabout something. If we\nplay a critically acclaimed\ngame, we\u2019re more likely\nto ignore its flaws and\nglitches and focus on its\nmore positive aspects.\nConsequently, we\u2019re more\nlikely to recommend it\nto friends or write good\nreviews about it. The\nsame is true in the exact\nreverse, if we play a critically panned game, every\nfault and error serves to\nadd to our view of it as a\n\u2018bad\u2019 game.\nThis is why game developers are selective about\nwho they get to review the\ngame before release. They\ntry to make sure that their\ngame gets played by the\nmore \u2018friendly\u2019 reviewers\nof the community so that\nearly opinions will be\nmore favourable. This\ncauses a ripple effect\nwhere the later reviewers\nwill also be favourable\nand positive, and, by ex-tension, more people will\nend up buying the game\nSometimes it might\nnot always be like this. A\nreally critical review of\na game from a long-run-ning franchise may be\ndismissed by its fans as\nbeing biased or unfair.\nFor the most part though,\nreviews do have a role to\nplay to how we go about\ndeciding which game to\nplay or buy. And it makes\nsense. Games aren\u2019t\nexactly the cheapest form\nof entertainment there\nis, so we want to make\nsure we get our money\u2019s\nworth. What\u2019s the point\nin investing in a product\nthat we know is going\nto disappoint us? So we\nread reviews to find out\nfor ourselves whether a\n\n"

On board we\nhad our Arduino powered\ntracker transmitting its\nGPS coordinates to us\non the ground packed in\na livid orange box, and a\n360\u00b0 camera sticking out\nfrom the bottom on the\nend of a metre-long selfie\nstick. The weather was\nexcellent for a high-alti-tude balloon launch, with\nonly somewhat mild wind\n(anything stronger would\nhave carried our precious\nballoon into the middle\nof the North Sea). The\nsky could not have been\nclearer, letting us capture\nsome clear shots and\nkeeping us warm as we\nprepped the payload for\nlaunch.\nAfter filling the balloon\nwith helium up to a\npre-calculated weight,\ntesting our tracker a\nfew times, and double\nchecking the camera was\nrecording, we let go of the\nballoon, and it drifted off\ninto the blue sky. We set\noff in a van, following the\nballoon across the English\ncountryside. Soon, as the\nballoon rose to a few kilometres in altitude, amateur\nradio stations in the area\nstarted also picking up our\nbeacon, helping map out\nthe balloon\u2019s trajectory as\nit sped off at 18m/s to the\nnorth east.\nThen, in an unexpected\nturn, at an altitude of\nabout 15 km, we started\nlosing telemetry. The\nradio signals from our\ntwo independent trackers\nremained strong, but the\ndata we received was\nall 0s. There seemed to\nbe some fault with the\nonboard GPS equipment.\nDetermined not to lose\ntrack of our balloon, we\ndrove to the point on the\nmap above which we had\nearlier predicted it would\nreach the apex of its trajec-tory. Since the atmosphere\nthins out rapidly with\naltitude, the air currents\nabove ~20 km are far\ntoo weak and the balloon\nwent directly up above\nus. Using a metre-long\ndirectional radio antenna\nwe determined the rough\nangle between us and the\nballoon, and were able to\nconfirm that it was indeed\nabove us. At that point we\nhad about half an hour to\nwait, during which time\nthe balloon would rise\nto its peak altitude, the\nballoon itself would burst,\nand the payload would\nfall rapidly towards the\nground with a small para-chute. As the payload falls\nbelow around 15 km, the\nair gets thick enough for\nthe parachute to slow it\ndown, and for atmospheric\ncurrents to start carrying\nit laterally. At this point,\nwe would need to chase it\nonce more in our van, and\ntrack where the payload\ntouches down.\nWe got lucky, however,\nand one of our GPS\ntrackers resumed transmitting accurate data\nbefore our payload passed\nback below the 15km\nline. As we later found\nout, the malfunction was\nlikely due to the oscillator\ncrystal getting too cold\non the GPS chips, as temperature dropped sharply\nwith altitude, causing their\ninternal clocks to be too\ninaccurate to make sense\nof the GPS signal. As the\npayload fell back down\ninto warmer atmosphere,\nand the oscillator warmed\nback up, the chip returned\nto its intended function\nwith no ill effects. (You\nmay have heard that GPS\nchips are designed to\nstop functioning above a\ncertain altitude, but ours\nwere designed to not have\nthis limitation so they\ncould be used in a high\naltitude flight.)\nWith our telemetry\nsignal restored, first on\none, then on both trackers,\nwe could easily follow\nthe payload\u2019s descent as it\nwas getting traced out automatically on a map, and\nfollowed it to its landing\nspot on the Great Massingham Airfield, Norfolk.\nWe called up the airfield\nowner, who helped us\nrecover our orange box.\nThe trip back to London\nwas spent looking over\nthe footage from the\ncamera, and hoping not\nto get stuck in Saturday\nevening traffic (which we\ndid).\nOverall, the balloon\ndrifted for over two hours\nbefore bursting as we had\nplanned, at an altitude\nof around 30 km. The\nall-important payload descended on our parachute,\nwhich proved to have been\nthe right size for the job.\nOur tracking had worked\nduring the most crucial\npart (descent and after\nlanding), and arguably the\nmost fragile part of our\npayload (the 360 camera\nwith its two exposed\nfisheye lenses) had been\nprotected sufficiently to\nsurvive a landing at over 4\nm/s. All valuable data for\nour future launches, which\nwill involve more serious\nscientific experiments.\nWe would love to\ncollaborate in future\nlaunches with those interested in sending a payload\nup to an altitude of 30km.\nWith most of the atmosphere below, we can get\nexcellent views of space,\naccurate atmospheric\ndata, and, depending on\nthe weather, a clear view\nof the ground below.\nWe are always looking\nfor new collaborators to\nexpand the size of our\nprojects. Do not hesitate\nto get in touch!\n\u2013 Ignaty RomanovChernigovsky\nThe High Altitude Balloon group with the recovered payload.

It\u2019s a separate\ncity with lively streets,\nfull of shops and diners to\nchoose from. The beach\nis enormously wide and\nseparated from the streets\nby tall cliffs. The Santa\nMonica pier offers a\nbreath-taking view of the\nPacific Ocean and is the\nend point of Route 66, the\nfamous road going all the\nway from Chicago across\neight states. We also took\na bus to Malibu, but the\nbeach there wasn\u2019t as nice\nas we\u2019d hoped \u2013 not really\nsuitable for swimming and\nmostly used by surfers.\nBack in Santa Monica,\nwe managed to catch a\nfiery sunset behind the\ncliffs, and then walked\nalong the ocean to Venice\nBeach, where we visited\ncanals similar to the ones\nin Venice, Italy. Unfortunately, it was already dark,\nso we couldn\u2019t appreciate\nthe area in all its beauty,\nand it felt a bit dodgy.\nAlso, despite the weather\nbeing very hot in LA, it\nwas at least 10o\nC colder at\nthe beach, and got really\nchilly in the evening. So\nmy advice is to arrive at\nthe beaches earlier to see\neverything before sunset.\nDay Two\nWe began this day by\nhiking to the Hollywood\nSign. We started from\nthe Griffith Observatory\nand took a path which\nwas meant to lead us to\nthe sign in around 90\nminutes. On our way, we\nnoticed signs warning\nhikers about rattlesnakes.\nBeing mesmerised by the\nviews of LA around us,\nwe somehow managed to\ntake the wrong turn which\nsteered us away from the\nmain path. We realised\nthat a bit too late so the\nonly option was hiking\nup and down every hill\non the way to the sign,\nusing narrow mountain\npaths, and holding onto\nstones in the ground to\navoid falling over. There\nwere no tourists \u2013 just a\ncouple of fit locals who\nclearly used this route for\ntraining. Only then did we\nrealised what we\u2019d got\nourselves into \u2013 but it was\nwell worth it when we\nfinally reached the sign!\nThe highest spot is just\nabove the letters, guarded\nby a tall fence \u2013 don\u2019t even\nthink about climbing over\nand sitting on them as it\nwill result in a fine and\npossibly imprisonment!\nWe opted for finishing\nour difficult hike with\nyet another challenge \u2013\nclimbing the last hill to\nreach the Wisdom Tree,\nwhere you can enjoy the\npanorama of LA for the\nlast time and appreciate\nthe greatness of the city.\nYou have the Hollywood\nHills around you with\nLake Hollywood and the\ncityscape at the bottom\n\u2013 a perfect interplay\nbetween natural and urban\nenvironments. Overall,\nour unexpected detour\ntook us around three and\na half hours (all in 35o\nC)\n\u2013 the struggle was real,\nbut this was one of the\nmost amazing things I\u2019ve\ndone in my life. Finally,\nwe finished the day by\nheading to Hollywood\nBoulevard to see the Walk\nof Fame.\nDay Three\nDay three was spent\nat the Universal Studios\nHollywood theme park.\nThe ticket includes\nnot only rides and live\nshows but also a tour of\nmovie sets.

However, we\nspent the rest of our day\non Hollywood Boulevard\nagain since we had won\ntickets to the filming of the\nJimmy Kimmel Live show.\nMany famous talk shows\ngive away free tickets,\nyou just need to enter a\ncompetition a few days in\nadvance \u2013 this will give\nyou a taste of how such\nshows work behind the\nscreen, and will definitely\nbe a memorable part of\nyour LA visit.\nDay Five\nOur last day was spent\nin Downtown LA, with\n\u201cYou have the\nHollywood\nHills around\nyou with Lake\nHollywood and\nthe cityscape\nat the bottom\n\u2013 a perfect\ninterplay\nbetween\nnatural\nand urban\nenvironments\u201d\nmajestic skyscrapers and\nthe beautifully-designed\nWalt Disney Concert Hall.\nWe also visited City Hall,\na high security institution\noffering panoramic views\nof the surrounding area\n(doesn\u2019t top the Hollywood Hills though!),\nand Little Tokyo, home\nto Japanese shops,\nmuseums, and gardens.\nFinally, before departing\nto our next destination, we\nexplored the area around\nthe bus station, where LA\nwas founded in 1781.\nLast points\nEven in mid-Septem-ber, the weather is very hot\n(~35o\nC) so make sure to\nbring something to cover\nyour head, and plenty of\nwater. Also, whilst LA is\ninfamous for trafic, we\ndidn\u2019t have any problems\nwith using public transport \u2013 going places took\ntime because it\u2019s a huge\ncity but it wasn\u2019t nearly\nas bad as we expected.\nFinally, if you have even\nmore time and run out of\nthings to do, you can drive\nto San Diego, a city south\nof LA, or visit Disneyland\nin Anaheim.\n\n"

Jean\nHonor\u00e9 Fragonard\u2019s chalk\nand ink image showing\nan artist, head bent in\ncreative crisis, as ideas\nand fantasies swirl around\nhim, is similarly po-faced,\nand teeters on the edge of\nironic camp.\nemotions, which belie the\ninner state of the artists,\nwho has been forced to\nflee his home country in\nthe advent of war.\nA similar conflict\nbetween beauty and terror\ncan be seen in the Egon\nSchiele work on display; a\nrare still-life, it depicts the\nbleached interior of the\nPOW camps in M\u00fchling,\nwhere Schiele was conscripted in WWI. While\nthere are none of Schiele\u2019s\ntortuous, fleshy bodies\non display, the absence\nof people manages to\nmake the image all the\nmore startling, with the\nunsettling lines instantly\nrecognisable as his. The\ndrawing highlights the\nbrutal tension at play;\nhis studio doubled as his\noffice, becoming simultaneously a source of artistic\nexpression and part of the\nvast machinations of war.\nThe exhibition is at its\nbest when invoking this\nkind of austere naturalism,\nwhich still manages to\ncontain emotional charge.\nMany of the drawings\nlack this, instead favouring a constructed, care-fully-curated reality: an\nartist dwarfed by a giant\nstatue of Jupiter in a set of\nnon-existent Roman ruins;\na deer leaping across the\npainter as he works en\nplein air, both amazing\nand shocking him; an\nempty studio where\nclutter still manages to be\nartfully arranged. If the\nexhibition shows anything\nabout how artists work, it\nshows they sure can be\ncontrolling.\nThe stand out drawing\nin the collection more\nthan makes up for some\nof this treacly fair: Horst\nTamsen\u2019s 1972 drawing of\nthe atelier of the sculptor\nReno Rossi, in Locarno,\nshows a squalid, rotting\nstudio, less sky-lit than\nsky-assaulted, with a thin\nbeam all that seems to\nbe keeping the decaying\nRomantic Europe.\nSculptures are picked out\nagainst the gloom and the\ncollapsing ceiling: a large\nfigure in rusty-red on one\nside; a glowering bust described in glowing pastels\nabove a dark beam; and, at\nthe centre, a ghostly blue\napparition draws the eye.\nIt\u2019s unclear what exactly is\nleaking out from the murk\nto meet us \u2013 the artist, or\nhis work?\nAnd so, while Artists\nat Work may tell us something about how artists do\nindeed work \u2013 drawing\nimplements abound, with\nmahl sticks aplenty \u2013 it\nshows us much more\nabout how they think,\nboth about themselves\nand the world.\nThis new display of drawings at the Courtauld Gallery highlights some technical aspects of how artists work, but\nreveals much more about how artists really view themselves.\nOffice at the M\u00fchling Prisoner-of-war Camp, Egon\nSchiele // Private Collection\nARTS\nFred Fyles\nEditor-in-Chief\nWhere? Courtauld Gallery\nWhen? Until 15th\nJuly\nHow Much?

George Grosz\u2019s\nself-portrait-cum-carica-ture similarly subverts the\nnotion of the artist at work,\nbalancing on the knife-edge of the grotesque:\nsitting at his desk, Grosz\nseems oblivious to the\ndestructive nature around\nhim, as an eagle clutches\nat a rat and beetles majestically scuttle across his\ndrawing tools. The 1940\ndrawing evokes confusing\n\u201cSchiele\nhighlights the\nbrutal tension\nat play, as he\ncompletes\nhis work in a\nprisoner of war\ncamp\u201d\nroof up. It\u2019s as majestic\nand melancholic as any\nworks from the period of\n\u2018ruin lust\u2019 that captured\nStudies of a man painting, Adolph von Menzel // Private\nCollection\n\n"
