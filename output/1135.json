It's a weird and wonderful album, and is the\nculmination of a world tour of live\nshows ( none of this pre-recorded on DAT bollocks) in cities such as\nBarcelona and Tokyo. So what's the\nalbum about? Well basically, it's loads\nof progressive house tunes all on one CD; but Coldcut have had an influence\nwith each track in some form or a not her (e.g. remixing). All the tunes are\ngreat and are by well-respected artists\nsuch as Carl Craig. There are chilled\nout tracks, vocal tracks e.g. the acoustic\nwarbling s of Miss Selena Saliva and the Sycophants on 'the Tale of Vig in i a Epitome' and' Noah's Toilet) - don't ask\nme what that's all about! There are two CDs on the album. The first features a dozen or so superb prog, house tracks,\nwhilst the second features another six\nor so which you can play on your PC or\non a normal CD player. Both CDs feature some tracks recorded live from some point of Coldcut's tour. Don't let\nthe packaging put you off either - it\nmay appear to be a happy hardcore\ntype album, but it's not. It is great and any progressive house fans out there\nshould get their hands on a copy of this\nalbum. Out now on Ninja Records.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nIblza Compilation Albums\nCafe Del Mar\nVolumes 1-3\nEvery summer, when thousands of us\nhead off on our holidays, the record\ncompanies' rub their collective hands together, and fill the shops up with the\n'produced-in-ten-minutes-to-make-a fast-buck1 CDs. These CD's( and there\nare loads of them) are the current hits\nthat have been on the dance floors in\nGreece, Spain etc. Basically, they have\nbeen chucked together and 'mixed' (?)\nby DJ Turntables (or whatever their\nnames are) in less time than it takes for\nyou to pull on your holiday, in the hope that as a 'reminder' of your hol s, you'll\nbuy the CD. Obviously if you want to\nbut them then fine, but there are lots\nof them and choosing the right one can often be a pain in the arse since\nthey're going to have tracks on them which you will hate.\nThe biggest group of CD's that come out are the ones that mention Iblza in\ntheir names, but one group of CDs that\nare definitely worth checking out, is the\nCafe Del Mar series. There are three of\nthem in this particular series, and Jose\nAlbums + Singles\nPadilla himself (the famous DJ of the\nCafe Del Mar) has chosen the tracks.\nAll the music on the CDs are taken from\nthe 1992-1996 period and the classic\nbalearic tunes that have shaped Ibiza\ninto what it is today. In short, these are\ntunes that have made Ibiza. All Ihe\noriginals are here, including Smoke belch II by the Sabres of\nParadise, Agua, and Jose Padilla the list\ngoes on and on. The tunes span the\nspectrum of the classic Ibizan hits. The\nmelodies, soft-vocal and instrumental\ntunes are on, as well as those tunes\nwith a slight beat and the sound of\nwaves crashing onto the beach, for\nthose of you who loved Ibiza a few, years ago, then you could do a lot\nworse than to check out this collection.\nAlright, it is a few years old now, but if\nyou want a trip down memory lane,\nthen check out these.\nOut on React Records\n(www.music-network.com/react)\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nSingle of the Week\nMonica\n'Inside' (Masters at Work remixes)\nOur single of the week and what at unc it is - is a superb track by Monica which features the MAW doing the remixing.\nIt's a cross between R& Band garage,\nsince it doesn't seem to be in either\ngenre, and it's the kind of tune you could smooch the night away to. A soft\nbass line and Monica's sweet voice make\nthe vocal mix arguably the best mix, but\nthere is a stack of mixes to choose from,\nincluding dubs, and a house mix. Mon ica's voice is great and the MAW do a superb job of giving us about half a dozen versions thanks to their mixes, giving plenty of variations. Great vocals,\ngreat tune - superb. Out in March. \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nFaith Evans\nAll night long'\nThe queen of R&B once again demonstrates why she is just that. All night long\nis a wonderful track1, which features the\nawesome voice of Faith, as well as tune\nwhich has a great rhythm to it. But you are simply lost in Evans' wonderful vocals\nand that's what really makes the track.\nThe single comes with three mixes, the\nalbum version (which is the best mix), an\nInstrumental (alright if you like the soft\ntune) and an ace ppell a( great if you just\nwant to hear Faith!). The tune features\nPuff Daddy and the train spotters might\npick up on the fact that the track takes\nexcerpts from' I hear music in the street'.\nOut soon through BMG. \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nDonna Dee\n'Hooked'\nA close runner for single of the week, it's a garage tune by one of the hottest\nproducers about on the garage scene at\nthe moment.1998 saw the release of\nDonna's superb\" Spellbound\" album, and in March of this year, she'll release\nthe Hooked cut (from the album). The\ntune features a very simple, catchy beat\nand soft vocals, making it an ideal\ngarage tune. Since it's kick up a storm\non the dancefloor s, a lot of people seem\nto agree. The CD comes with three\nmixes, the best of which is by the Ruff\nDriverz.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nGrant Nelson Feat. Jean McClaln\n'Step 2 Me'\nA good soulful, garage tune featuring\nthe vocal talents of Jean McClain. Again,\nit's a good, simple track - no fancy break-downs or anything. Good vocals, sim-ple, catchy tune. The track comes with\nfour mixes, but unfortunately they all\nsound exactly the same, with minimal\nchange leaving the variation a bit thin.\nOut in March. \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nBlackout\n'Gotta have hope'\nMultiply is a record label with a history\nof producing great tracks - apart from\nthis one. This has to be one of the worst\ntunes I have ever heard, and what's more plenty of people agree (ask the\nChemistry students in the Evans lab!).\nThe track is simply crap. It kicks off with\na beat that is fine enough, but which is\nthen murdered as a woman starts to rand om ly scream \"gotta have hope\". Not\ncontent with that, the producers then\nintroduce the theme from '2001 A Space\nOdyssey', again, completely randomly,\n! before the woman, once again, starts\n| screaming again. The CD comes with\nj three mixes, one allegedly by Judge I Jules, though tragically your ears are\n! subjected to exactly the same tune as\nthe other two mixes. An awful track,\nwhich you should avoid. It's only use is\nas a present for someone you really\nhate.\nGurm\n\n"

    "content": "10 Columns 8 February 1999\nNothing tastes good unless it contains fat or sugar. I know this is not very politically cor-rect, but I honestly can't think of a single exception. You may have noticed that most of the recipes I 've featured In this column have contained a generous helping of cream, oil, butter, or all three. I'm one of those annoying people who can eat enormous quantities of food, without putting on weight. My cooking tends towards maximum flavour,\nwhatever the damage. If you' re more calorie conscious than I a m,I'm afraid this week's recipes are particularly fattening. Fruit Cake\nCake is the ultimate example of the Joy that is fat and sugar combined. This is the nicest\nfruit cake recipe I 've found. It's really K^r* \u00a7m^> moist, but not unpleasantly sweet. Even if you' re not normally keen on fruit cake, you might find you like\nthis one. If you already have the spices etc, you could make this for only a few pounds, well within even the tightest budget.8 oz Butter\n8 oz Soft brown sugar2 tbs Treacle\n4 Eggs\n12 oz Flour\n1 tsp Baking powder1 tsp Ground cloves1 tsp Cinnamon1 tsp Nutmeg4 oz Ground Almonds8 oz Currents8 oz Raisins\n8 oz Sultanas\n2.5 fl oz Milk Juice of an orange Grease a20cm round cake tin, and line with grease proof paper. Cream the butter (I always soften\nit by heating in the microwave for10 seconds), then beat in the sugar. Stir in the treacle, then give every-thing a good mix. Add the eggs one at a time. Mushroom Sauce\nCooks\nCorner\ndJ\nBreak each egg into a cup and beat with a fork, then fold into the mixture with a tablespoon of flour. Fold\nin the remaining flour, combined with the spices and baking powder. Finally, add the fruit, milk and orange juice.\nBake at 160\u00b0Cor gas mark3 for two-and-a half\nhours. Rest a piece of foil over the tin for the last\nhour, to prevent a thick crust. Make sure that the cake is left to cool completely before cutting. Warm cake is really crumbly, and not nearly as good. \u2022Mk <-Sk\nHr*\nII P^^w Mushrooms are one of my favourite ingredients. They' re best cooked in\nsome kind of sauce. The best thing about mushrooms is that they soak uploads of butter, taking on a fantastic mellow flavour that goes well with pretty much anything. I rarely buy mushrooms from the market. The supermarket stock is always much better quality, well worth the extra expense. To make a basic sauce, start by melting a generous knob of butter ( about50 g) slowly in a small\npan. Slice 5 medium mushrooms thinly. Heat gently for about5 minutes until they turn a medium brown colour, losing the softness of raw mushrooms. Add a couple of tablespoons of double cream, mix well then turn up the heat. Cook until the mushrooms start togo a little brown and crispy.\nThe sauce is great as part of a breakfast fry-up.\nI normally chop a big sprig of parsley and add it at\nthe end. It also makes a good accompaniment to a steak, and is just fantastic with a pork chop. When served with meat, I often stick in a couple of teas po on s of peppercorn mustard to add some body.\nA very different sauce can be made with the addition of olive oil, thyme, garlic, and balsam ic vinegar. Fry a couple of cloves of crushed garlic gently with a teaspoon of thyme, in the olive oil. Add the\nmushrooms and cook as before. Ahead of adding the cream, chuck in a tablespoon of balsam ic vine-gar, and bubble for a minute. Next week: Bangers and Mash\nPresidential Talk-Back\nAn issue always on student's minds is\nmoney and that's why I'm devoting my column to it for a second time. The Access fund is reopened again for applications. 246 awards have already been made totalling \u00a3144 300 that'san average of around \u00a3590 per student. There is still \u00a3150 0 0 0 left in the kitty\nfor the rest of the year, though by my calculation that's enough for another254 students to gain equivalent awards. If you' re in a desperate financial situation at the moment, why not let the Government help you out, it's money for the taking the College and the Union has nothing to gain by not dishing out every penny. All you need to do is pickup a form from room334 in the Sherfield Building and have them filled out by the22 nd March. The other financial side of being a student that has hit the first years is\ntuition fees. Two students in Oxford have hit the headlines recently by David Hellard,\nrefusing to pay their\ntuition fees on principle. Since then they\nhave backed down, being threatened with everything the jj j College could throw JJJ\nat them. In Imperial \u2022\nthe situation is \u2022\nsomewhat different; \u2022\nwe too have various \u2022\nstudents that \u2022\nhaven't paid yet, but H the way the students H have acted and the \u2022\nresponse from the H College has been^ comparatively relaxed. I was in the Coll e ge Welfare Committee today and the whole issue was brought up. The College stated the current situation and asked what the response was on the student side, something which I could not give, not having spoken to a sin-ICU President\ng le first year about it. There has been no feedback on the way the collecting has been administered or whether being able to pay by\ninstalment has sufficiently eased the burden, so one can only assume that it\nhas run as smoothly as I hoped. As ever if you have any feedback on this issue:.. email mei pre sl: dent@ic.ac.uk).\nNext week the second instalment of tuition fees are to be paid in. I'm sure by now some students would have spent all of their\nmoney for the year including that they\nowe in tuition fees. If you're in this situ ation, it might be worth thinking about applying to the above, that's what it's there for.\nTo end with I have a personal plea\nto every student out there. As you're\nprobably all aware, the14 th is Valent in es day, where every single person has to put up with being publicly told\nthat no-one loves them or finds out that that mystery admirer is the person\nyou thought it was and never liked\nanyway. Each year I have a com pet i tion with my sister to see who receives\nthe most cards, the loser being subject\nto weeks of patronising phone calls,\nthe winner the love of my mum. Last\nyear I had to face the humiliation of being thrashed40; after four years of victory this hit hard and I have to make a good comeback this year or risk\nemotional damage. Basically if you have any spare cards, please donate them to such a worthy cause as my own, either through the internal mail,\nor just drop them into the Union. Many Thanks. "

A large crowd of approximately100 were in attendance to witness a great night of entertainment. The evening started when members of the third year treated the audience to a sketch entitled \"Alan Jones Beat this for puns per minute\". This was a delightfully well-written sketch with the\ninnuendos flowing thick and fast. Next\nup were the first year blok es in drag, or\nthe Vice Girls, as they prefer to be called.\nThe group did two songs; Wannabe and2 become1. However the lyrics were slightly doctored to suit their filthy\nminds. Well done to Akira Kirton( ming er spice), Trev Dhruphalshah (hairy\nspice), Barry Edmond stone( wolf ie spice), Howard Buckley (to ff spice) and Nick Holt ( camp spice). The next act\ncame from the second years, who did a rendition of Blind Date, where three\nblok es revelled in the opportunity to parody their lecturers.\nChris Wood roof e produced a real\ntreat for the next sketch;\" Professor Wood roof e's Hierarchy of Love\". Apparently this is based on a design tech-By Padraig McCluskey\nni que the third years use. Helped by his\nable assistant he proceeded to describe\nthe five levels of love, from choosing which type of relationship is best for you through to how to separate from your\nloved one. This sketch was my personal favourite, and indeed had every-body in the audience in stitches.\nReuben Connolly (President) and Sanella\nHod zi c( DSO) from the City and Guilds\nExecutive arrived on stage next to illustrate a light-hearted approach to squeezing money out of the City and Guilds. This was followed by a short\nspeech by Mr Connolly, praising the Chemical Engineering Society for their\nhard work over the past 50 years which has lead them to their current strong position.\nAfter the interval the old hacks (4th years) made their appearance stage left,\npresenting\" Whose degree is it any-way?\" This sketch took the format of the\nsimilarly titled Channel4 programme. The last sketch of the evening was written and performed by two new members of staff; Claire Ad jiman and Omar Matar. Professor Stephen Richards on and the Head of Department, Professor John Perkins, ably assisted them. This sketch also centred on a selection\nprocess. This interview was based on the selection of research candidates.\nAlthough this was not as side splitting\nas some of the other sketches, the general consensus was that it was at least\ngood to see the staff making an effort.\nThe evening was a great success,\nespecially as so many people made the effort to come and support it. Special\nthanks must go to those who wrote and performed the sketches and all the members of staff who took the trouble\nto attend.\nDebt Decreases Your Health: Official\nDisturbing new research to be published\nin The Psychologist shows that students\nare twice as likely to suffer from ill health\nand reduced mental well-being as their\ncontemporaries who are not at university.\nThe study by Dr Ron Roberts, a psychologist at the University of Westminster, has\nconfirmed what most students'already\nfeel - that there is a clear link between rising levels of debt among students and the comparatively lower levels of health.\nIn 'Student Finance and Mental Health',\na paper co-authored with colleagues Dr\nJohn Golding and Dr Tony Towell, Dr\nRoberts presents the results of the study\ncarried out at two London universities\n(one old and the other new).\nUnsurprisingly, Dr Roberts found that\nstudents' general health, assessed on the basis of physical vitality and psychological and social functioning, was \"sub-st anti ally worse than that of young people\nof the equivalent age and sex in the general population\". He linked this to stu-dents' working for longer hours in order\nto make ends. meet. It was found that\nthose students surveyed considering the abandonment of their studies were generally likely to suffer from poorer health,\nboth physically and mentally.\nThe study also revealed that students\nBy Sunil Rao\nin debt were more likely than others to\nknow other students who were involved\nin prostitution, drug dealing and criminal\nactivities in order to bolster their financial\nstate. Dr Roberts concludes that \"stu-dents were on average twice as likely to\nbe in poor health when compared to\n[sic] non-students of the same sex and age\".\nThis study comes as the Government\nannounced on29 January that tuition\nfees would go up in line with inflation to\na maximum of \u00a31,025 for the academic year 1999/2000. Figures from the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service (UCAS) also reveal that the number of applications from mature students has\nfallen sharply for the second year running\nfollowing the introduction of tuition fees.\nBaroness Blackstone, the Education\nand Employment Minister, has\nannounced a new scheme designed to\nhelp part-time students. From the autumn\nof next year, part-time students in higher\neducation on a low income will be entitled to loans of at least \u00a3500. With over\n2 8 % of current students being part-time,\n30 million pounds have been allocated to\nsupport the new loan scheme over its first\ntwo years.\nAlarming levels of student poverty\nwere highlighted in a Times Higher Education Supplement poll revealing that\nthree-quarters of non-first year students\nhave cut back on buying clothes, shoes or food. Almost a quarter have cut back\non book-buying, more than four in ten students work during term-time (more\nthan half of these work in bars); what's worrying is that over 3 0 % of these work more than the official recommendation of a maximum of fifteen hours a week. Research previously published by Glasg ow Caledonian and Paisley Universities\nand the Scottish Low Pay Unit had demonstrated that the long hours and low pay were having a serious impact on the academic performance of students.\nThis has also been confirmed in research\nby Lindsey Bowes and Sue Moon of the University of Central England.\nA spokeswoman for the Committee of Vice-Chancellors and Principals commented that it was \"each student's personal responsibility\" to strike the right\nbalance between part-time work and studies. \"Harship funds are available. Students in financial difficulties should seek\nadvice from the support services\".\nissue 1135\n8 February 1999\nEditor: Ed Sexton\nAssistant Editor & Films: David Roberts\nNews Editor: Andrew Oforl\nMusic Editors: Dennis Patrickson\n& Jason Ramanathan\nArts Editor: Helena Co che me Games Editor: Gary Smith\nClub scene: Gur minder Mur wah a& Joel Lewis\nSports Editor: Gus Paul\nPhotographic Editor: William Lorenz\nIn brief...\nElection Update\nThe Union breathed a sigh of relief this\nweek as all nominations were filled.

    "content": "8 February 1999 Arts 21\nPATRICK CAULFIELD\nHayward Gallery\nCaulfield' s still-lives are a contra dic tion. His planar and graphic images are reminiscent of comic strip cells, swamped in bright, uniform and intense colours. Each form is defined\nby pronounced black contours, much like the leading of stained\nglass windows( incidentally, also\nthe subject of a picture). Yet this\nradical simplification is aptly compensated for by prominent perspective guidelines, which expand\nthe dimensions of perception.\n\" My subject matter has no specific geographical situation, it could\nbe anywhere in the world. That's why I use certain imagery rather\nrepetitive ly, such as pots. Greek pots picked up from the seabed could have been made last week, they are of a similar form, retain the\nsame function and are equally\ncompelling but without a date -this is the antithesis of the PepsiCola bottle.\"\nHis pictures are light-hearted and decorative, often depicting interiors and landscapes. He also injects insight and humour into his work, parodying Stubbs\nwith a horse profile and interpreting a Delacroix composition. He also juxtaposes contrasting techniques to great\neffect, clashing the almost abstract with\nexcessive photographic realism. A finely\ndetailed rose or wineglass is the focus of the composition amidst a geometric backdrop.\nThis major retrospective highlights Caulfield's distinctive style,\nhowever the format of his work remains, perhaps disappointingly,\nstatic throughout his distinguished\ncareer, although in more recent\npaintings he admittedly introduces\nthe concept of texture to otherwise\nrigorously smooth canvases. Cauldfield enjoys teasing the viewer with\ntrompe I 'oeil representations of matter - an invitation to an obscure\nworld of fantasy issued from the quotidian.\nNearest tube: Waterloo/Embankment\nAdmission: \u00a36, concessions \u00a34\nOpening hours: daily 10am6 pm( Tues-day and Wednesday until 8 pm) Helena\nUntil 11th April\nPICASSO AND PHOTOGRAPHY: THE DARK MIRROR\nBarbican Art Gallery\nT his exciting exhibition - a condensed version of shows from the Mu see Picasso in Paris - explores Pablo\nPicasso's relationship with photography.\nThe display opens with a few classical\nSpanish painters; the influence of El\nGreco is highly noticeable, from then on, we follow Picasso's work, beginning with\nhis preparation and research for the revolutionary Les Demoiselles d 'Avignon.\nHe prepared sketches from photos of West African women taken at the beginning of the century. This section is very beautiful - it's fas-c in a ting to discover the making of such an influential\npainting. His time at the5| Bateau-Lavoir studio in MontX mart re during19051909 is\nthen depicted, including many pictures of his friends.\nThe next collection takes us to Horta de Ebro in Spain\nwhere he painted the Houses\non the Hill. Again, we witness\nthe step by step creation of the piece, as he uses photography as his main influence and help. The following\nroom shows a few images of his own art, with an installation of papier s colle s. Picasso captures the mood and spirit of his time\nthrough photography. He took great portraits of some of the most\nprominent artists of the 1910s: the poets\nMax Jacob and Apollinaire (in hospital\nwith his war injuries) as well as the painters feD ou ani er Rousseau and Marie Laurencin (a rare contemporary\nfemale artists). He even managed to record his collaboration with Stravinsky\non the ballet Parade in 1917, for which he painted the decor. The exhibition\nthen focuses more on other photographers' take on his art and his partnership\nwith some of them. First, we seeD or a Maar's series depicting the creation of Guernica in 1937. Each photo is taken at\na different stage and therefore constitutes a precious documentation of Picasso's artistic technique. Other famous\nphotographers include Do isn eau and Brassai. Both observed him in the intimacy of his art. Brassai's pictures show his inventive paper sculptures of the 1940s. The final\nrooms concentrate on the last 20 years of the artist's creative life. First, we explore\nhis collaboration with Andre Villers. Picasso used his paper cut-outs approach on Villers' photographs, giving\nrise to some tremendously innovative pieces. Particularly memorable was the cleverly superimposed presentation of palm and mask\nsilhouettes. The last room is\nyet another original creation\n- light or space images using\nlight bulbs, with Picasso\ndrawing and the photographer Gjon Mill capturing the movements. Photography was always\na major element in Picasso's artistic career and personal\nlife. We get a delightful\ninsight into his captivating\nworld, so I strongly recommend this to all\nPicasso lovers.\nUntil 28th March Nearest tube: Barbican\nAdmission: \u00a36, concessions \u00a34\n\n"

Very soon, you'll\nbe wearing clothes that do the same.\nEmma Freeman tells all...\nbiology and physics\"\n\u2022 can think of few things worse than\nI being surrounded by flying insects in\nI an enclosed space. This is where my vegetarian views come unstuck as I have\nfew qualms about delivering\nall manner of death by drown- \"A fare COlla b Oing, swiping, crushing or\nspraying any insect who dares ration De iWO Sn to roam uninvited in my home. I was however per-sua ded to look upon butter-flies, and dare I say it, moths,\nin a slightly more favourable\nlight due to some work going on down in Exeter.\nTwo physicists at Exeter University\nhave reason to believe that butterflies\nmay one day be responsible for anti-counterfeiting devices in credit cards and bank notes, wide-angle liquid crystal displays or, if it takes your fancy, a new trend\nfor iridescent clothing. Peter Vukusic and Professor Roy Sambles have Initiated a rare collaboration between biology and physics, two sections of the scientific\ncommunity who are scarcely seen in the same vicinity together, let alone poring over the same lab book.\nThe pair are looking at butterflies and moths, whose wings prod u ce the most striking, intense iridescent colours found anywhere else in nature. In studying this iridescent property Vukusic and Sambles hope to discover the secrets\nthat lie behind their ability to produce such striking colours. They then \u2022\nhope to be able to reproduce these\neffects artificially under UV, infrared |j and radar wavelengths of light.\nThe iridescent nature of moths and butterflies has much the same effect as car headlights have when they shine onto a patch of engine oil\non a wet road. In the same way that\nthe colours in the oil change as you cross the road, a butterfly can appear J M jiL in different colours, depending on I the angle from which you look at it.\nThe iridescence that we see is jP\na product of the light rays reflected\nwhen light hits a film that has a mirror-like surface. When the incoming light\nhits the top surface of the film, some of it is reflected. The rest carries on travelling through the material\nuntil it reaches the lower\nsurface, where more light\nrays are reflected. The colours themselves depend on how far the light has had to travel\nwithin the film and to what\nextent the density of the film affects the light's speed and dire c tion. The colours change as the object or\nobserver changes position in relation to\nthe light.\nThis indicates that the iridescent\ncolours produced by butterflies are a consequence of the physical structure of\ntheir wings. Vukusic and Sambles have\ntherefore been looking at wing structure using electron microscopy. They\n\"Christmas tree\" structures on the\nMorpho butterfly\nbegan by looking at\nmoths, whose \u2022wings, like butterflies', are aft mosaic of * \\\nscales, ; %\narranged in a I roof-tile pattern. It arose that inside each\nscale lay a complex geometric frame-work. Cuticles of chitin were arranged in\nlayers, concertinaed with layers of air. This\nmeans that when sunlight strikes a scale,\nit becomes filtered through a whole series of chitin layers, each acting as a mirror-like film. They produce a multitude of reflections. The layers differ in\nthickness and distance away from one another and so varies the series of colours we see on the moths wings.\nOn discovering this, Peter Vukusic\nwent on to look at the wings of butter-flies. Out of all of those he has studied,\nit is the Morph o species of butterfly\nwhich has captured his interest the most.\nMorph o is a tropical species with electric\nI blue wings. When Peter looked at\n\\ individual scales from this butterfly, he\n\u2022 found that they were made up of a| series of longitudinal ridges, foo king at the ridges more closely he saw that each was made up of multiple\nreflective surfaces. More specifically,\nthey were in the form of what he now calls \"Christmas tree\"\nstructures. \"The overall\nThe \"Christmas\ntrees\" sit on the surface effect is a stun\nof a scale, arranged in\nrows. Each of their tiny\nbranches interferes with\nincoming light from the\ntop and bottom surfaces,\nreflecting a series of coloured rays.\nThe scatter of these rays is considerably increased by the overlapping nature of the scales on the butterfly'swing which diffract the light rays. The\noverall effect is a stunning metallic\nblue butterfly which is visible from as\nmany positions as possible.\nVukusic\n*m and Sambles have gone on to investigate the optical properties of butterfly scales using lasers. The\nlasers determine exactly how much light\nis reflected by a single scale and how this\nis dispersed. So far they have found that\nsome scales are capable of reflecting as\nmuch as 7 5 % of the light they receive in\nthe visible blue spectrum. This is an amazing amount considering that each\n2j V.II Mllllli\nning metallic\nblue \"\nScales of the Morph o butterfly\nwing scale is made up of a simple carbohydrate material which has arisen from\na single cell. This work is progressing\nfurther by investigating the optical properties of structures in butterfly wings in\nspectrums of light which include the\ninfrared and ultraviolet wavelengths.\nThe team in Exeter have already\ndeveloped a theory so that they can mathematically model the \"Christmas\ntree\" architecture found on the Morph o butterfly. As\nthey gather more information they plan to develop a com pul er model which can\npredict the optical response\nof various physical structures\nacross abroad range of wavelengths.\nWith this kind of information, it\nshould be possible to establish some rules for mimicking butterfly reflectors in\na variety of ways. So when you find yourself paying with your iridescent credit\ncard for some iridescent hair spray, to go\nwith your iridescent clubbing top, remember where you saw it first.\n\n"

This\nff HB week I'm bring in you a Blackstreet special, with their third album soon to drop\nwe ha\\ea look at their classic second album. Quick piece of news regarding the funky foursome...they are\nonly three. Vtark Middleton has left the crew to pursue\na solo career, joining old meme be rs David Hollister and Levi Little w 'ho are seeking op port unties elsewhere.\nWhat is it with this group? Group members seem to be dropping like flies, theres no news on whether a replacement is going to be brought in... we'll keep you updated on the situation.\nMilen\nCLASSIGxlbum\nBLACKSTREET: ANOTHER LEVEL\nTeddy \"Street\" Riley, heralded composer/ producer/\nsinger and leader of platinum soul super group Blackstreet, power crooner and group co-founder Cha unc ey \"Black\" Hannibal, and the talented new members Eric\nWilliams and Mark Middleton, took R&B to another\nlevel in 96 and far beyond. Introduced by the funk d afi ed, feel good lead single No\nDiggity, produced by Riley and William Stewart, and featuring a phat rap intro by Dr. Drc, this impressive new album elevated the so called urban music scene, expanding the soulful parameters in the process. \"Another Level is a reflection of where Blackstreet has OK OK, I'm sure there are a number of you out\nthere who are wondering where the hell in\nthe thriving vast expanse of urban faeces\nknown as London is the Hackney Warehouse. The\nmore street wise amongst you, the ones with one ear\nsurgically attached to the ground, will be fretting your\nbrows for not having heard of this venue. Well the truth is, it's not a permanent venue and has only just\nopened for this night. It is in fact a teal warehouse and also the home to Billy Mahon ie's guitarist/bassist\nHywell. To be accurate there is no traditional front\nman as Billy Mahon ie have no singer, but more of that\nlater.\nThe gig was the most underground one I 've ever\nbeen to, firstly it was invite only and secondly the\nvenue was a freezing warehouse with no bar and one feeble portable heater on the constant verge of col-lapse. The crowd was mainly indie types from all parts,\npredominantly France and Japan and the atmosphere soon started to liven.\nBilly Mahon ie take their name from one of the characters out of 'Flatliners', you know the movie where a bunch of college students experiment with near-death by going' flat line'. They are a four piece, with\nGavin on guitar, Kev on bass Howard on drums and Hywell alternating between guitar and bass.They formed\nat end of '97 and have released two singles since then, Hoon and Whistling Sam. None of Billy Mahon ie's material has had a wide distribution because they've only\nreleased it through small indie labels. If you can't get\nbeen, where we're at and where we're going,\" explained Teddy, acclaimed architect of the historic 80s R&B/ hip-hop revolution still globally revered as ' New Jack\nSwing.'\nBuilding on the certified platinum foundation forged by\nBlackstreet's debut 1994 self-titled, million seller CD, which spawned the top charted hits Bootie Call, Before\nI Let Co, Joy, and Tonight's Ihe Night, the power of\nAnother Level is undeniable. The jeep ready and radio\nfriendly No Diggitywas the perfect funky beginning for\nthe red hot quartets cold chl ll in' album. Primarily\nrecorded at Teddy's state of the art future Recording\nstudio in Virginia Beach, Virginia (where he and his family also reside).\n\"We worked hard to give the album depth, substance\nand maximum Blackstreet flavor,\" assures Riley, whose inspired musicianship, production and overall creative\ngenius is indelibly imprinted throughout the sizzling\nhold of them you should checkout Moonlight Madness\non Ride's Carnival of Light LP where the psychedelic\nsemi-instrumental mimics Billy Mahon ie's guitar cr a zi ness. Billy Mahon ie are totally instrumental and this\naspect reinforces the interplay between the guitars.\nThere influences vary broadly from dEUS and early\nMo gwa i to Miles Davis and DJ Shadow. There was a mixture of styles to the sounds they\nproduced, ranging from mellow jan gly indie to mashed\nup psychedelic meandering through a sea of thrashed\nout discordant guitar chopping. The tendency towards\nthe latter was on the agenda. Hywell was the most energetic, thrashing himself around while thrashing his guitar around and at the sametime dropped his pick and retrieved it from the tangled mess of wires on the floor\nin the blink of an eye.\nFor the future Billy Mahon ie have a debut album lined up and will be in the studio during February\nrecording with producer Head for Too Pure. They were deservedly mentioned in the NME' stop20 bands to\nwatch for in 1999 and they will be playing again from the end of February. Check out future issues of Felix for\ndates and venues. H Jason\nalbum. Outstanding tracks from the album\nincluded: Good Lovin', a scintillating slow-jam seductively delivered by Chauncey,\nwho equally excels on the R&B Beautiful\nLet's Stay In Love, Never Gonna Let You\nGo, a tour-de-force romantic anthem, sparked by Marks\nexplosive, scale defying tenor; The Fix,\" a totally addictive, head kn odd in' Blackstreet butte track; / Can't Get\nYou Out Of My Mind, unforgettably powered by Eric's lush leads and Blackstreet's multi-layered harmony;\nand Can't Buy Me Love, a serious soul remake of the\nBeatles '60s classic.\nThe departure of Levi (Little) and David (Hollister) was unexpected and looked as if could be a little unsettling.\nWhen Mark and Eric stepped in everyone out there\nimmediately realized the change was just a blessing in\ndisguise. Their sound became stronger, tighter and more diverse, Eric and Mark both sang incredible lead\nvocals and harmonies.\nIts no accident that Blackstreet's second long player was titled Another Level. Teddy illuminates: \"from stronger\nleads, to hyper harmony, to more live instruments, to\nending the album on a spiritual high note ( \" God Is\nReal\"), \" he concludes, \"this is the off-the-hook album we wanted the first one to be.\" There's no doubt that\nthis album is a pure classic skill z.

Most of you will have heard of them thanks to their recent Top 20 hit\nand breakthrough single Beautiful Day\nHowever, this song is unrepresentative\nof the album, whose tracks are far\nremoved from the string-laden rock bal-lad.\nthey formed in 1995, based on the\nsongwriting partnership of singer and bassist Pete Vuckovic and guitarist Chris\nMcCormack. The pair used to write songs\ntogether via post before they had even\nmet and they happily boast that they\nhad formed a prolific partnership before\neven setting eyes on each other. On realising their songwriting potential they\nenlisted guitarist Ben Harding and dr u mmer Keith Baxter to form a band. They\ncalled themselves 3 Colours Red after the\ncritically acclaimed French film. They\nreleased This Is My Hollywood independently in 1996 and soon attracted record\nlabel attention, eventually signing to Creation by the end of the year.\nNever-ending tours and the release\nof four singles and an album soon made them known across the country but their\nmusic was never accessible or original\nenough for mainstream success. They\ntried harder for their next album, realising that some slower, more melodic songs would make a welcome break\nfrom the non-stop hurricane of rock and punk. They gave us the single Paralyse\nlast October which the band describes as\n'like nothing we' ve done before, think\nPantera and The Pixies with a George Harrison melody.' Quite an accurate\ndescription, except for the Harrison bit.\nOh, and the melody bit as well. Unfortunately, the track is the same as all their\nprevious songs - loud guitars and drums,\ngrunge voice just with different words.\nWhich is what can be said for the majority of songs on this album, one terrible song seamless ly rolling into another.\nHowever, there area couple that\ndemand a second listen.\nfirst off is Back To The City which\nmixes Johnny Rotten vocals with comical\nearly '80's electric rock, not as bad as if\nseems actually. Then we have a rare\nslow song in This is My Time which is a standard orchestral ly enhanced rock\nanthem, despite it starting like Spandau\nBallet.\nThat leaves us finally with current single Beautiful Day. It's hard to tell whether\nthis song will help or hinder them. Whilst\nit will open them up to a mainstream\naudience, it could ruin their image as the\nhard boys of rock. 3 Colours Red are\nthat rarest of things, a band that manages to occasionally create powerful uplifting songs but equally as many crap\nones, unable to separate the good from the bad. A bit like their record company Creation, who for every Oasis they also\nsign a3 Colours Red. H EdJ\nDESERT EAGLE DISCS\nThe Eagle Has Landed\nI was handed this CD, complete with\nthe now obligatory Parental Advisory\nsticker with a rough outline of the sound: 'Well, it's sort of R'n' B.' Right-oh\nthen... I'm probably not the best ambassador for the new R'n' B( because didn't there used to bean old one? Y 'know,\nlike Jools Holland and his Rhythm and Blues Orchestra play), considering that\nmy music collection is what most pe ople would term 'guitar music' with the odd splash of01' Blue Eyes and a helping of Korn.\nWell, here we go. The main musicians in the group are Syze-Up and Shari\nJ. Jules (okay so far) and you might have\nheard of Syze-Up before if you're familiar with Puff Daddy's Bad Boy label. He has released a few remixes on it and has\nalso worked with several stateside artists.\nRight, that's enough of who they are - on\nto the shiny CD. That's why I like CDsy ou can make pretty patterns on the ceiling with them using a simple desk\nlamp and your hand. The chief thing that I( a novice to the\nworlds of R'n' B, rap and hip-hop, of which Iam reliably Informed that this is\nan amalgam) noticed is that all the songs\ncome from the same formula. They start\nwith a rock-steady rhythm section (no fills\nif possible, please), followed by an enema inducing bass, a sample or two\nand lyrics with plenty of not so vague sexual references and metaphors. While this is not necessarily a bad thing, I expect something a little more varied\nfrom my music. Having said that, the album as a whole is a very mellow affair\nlaced with the aforementioned elements\nto good effect.\nThis is a special type of music and I shall attempt to set the scene in which it may be listened to. You come home after being out (a club, the pub, what-ever) and It's late. You might be with\nsome friends or a lay dee or a blok e, but\nI have experience with the former so we'll stick with that. You go to the stereo\nand put some tunes on. That's the style,\nit's background, incidental music or, for\nwant of a better phrase, it's shagging music. Thai's what D.E.D. is a first class\nchoice for but it doesn't flick my switch,\nfloat my boat, y 'know. And The Lovers is\nthe same song as Would You kill For Me?\nbut without the naughty swearing. You\ncan't fool me1 know. El Christian\n\n"

    "content": "24 Games 8 February 1999\nThe x Wing Collector SeriesX-Wing, Tie Fighter, X Wing Vs Tie Fighter (PC)\nLucasArts\nOur beloved Games Editor likes to dress\nup as Darth Vader - in fact he's rarely happier than when clad in tight black leather,\nwith an enclosing black mask covering his visage, whilst manhandling an enormous throbbing weapon. But enough of that...\nAnyone who' s been in a computer games shop in the last five years (in fact\nalmost anyone 'of a certain age' who hasn't actually been dead for the last\nfive years) will be familiar with the X Wing series. In fact there maybe those of you out there thinking\" Hang on, these games have been out for at least\nthree years - why the hell are they being reviewed now?\" Not to put too fine a point on it, the last couple of weeks have been rather fallow for PC gamers .\nMost of the major releases have been saved for the spring schedules, which means that we have to fill in with compilations and a certain amount of gossip,\nfortunately, a couple of the games pub!kh\u00a3>rs im der stand this and have released\nsome rather good compilations to help\nus poor PC Gamers survive. Blizzard are\none( see last issue), and Lucasarts (bless\n(heft cotton socks) are another.\nLucasarts have re-packaged and rei ei eased all of their Star Wars games in\nthe last month or so. This may not be\nit i rely unconnected with the flood of interest being generated by the trailer for Episode 1 which was showing at selected cinemas recently. Most of the games have\nbeen released at budget (or at\nleast cheaper) prices, and in one or two cases re-jigged to take\nadvantage of minor innovations\nsuch as 3D cards and DirectX. In\none case some additional (and\nexclusive) missions have been put\ntogether solely for this release.\nAt this point I'd better declare an\ninterest -1 ama Star Wars fan. As a kid I had the figures and many of the ships.\nI'd have them still had my mother not\nsold them for a measly five quid. While\nI'm not totally blind to the faults in the\nfilms (the unnecessarily long dialogue y bits, Leia's haircuts, Luke Skywalker full-stop), I shall be amongst those queuing round the block In the summer, ate nner in my damp, sweaty palm. I'm looking\nforward to it, and I'm not ashamed. Oh yes, the games. Right, the flight sims, X wing, Tie fighter and X Wing vs Tie\nfighter, collectively known as the X Wing\nTrilogy.\nX Wing has been knocking about for quite\nsometime now. It has the\ndistinction of being the first\ngame I actually\nwent out and bought with my own money. It's best\nsummed up as the best bits from the films - namely the fights. You are (nat u rally) a rebel starfighter pilot, and get to fly all the ships from the films - X Wing, Y Wing, A Wing\nand B Wing. Broadly speaking the\nmissions follow the films, and yes, you do get the chance to fly\nalong the equatorial trench of the Death Star - if you're good enough. For this release it's been cleaned up a bit, the graphics in\nparticular being upgraded to take advantage of current technology. It also\nincludes the two expansion packs, and may well be your only chance of getting\nthem. However, despite the upgrade, it'snow definitely showing its age. Tie fighter was X Wing's sequel, although it's more of a companion piece.\nOne of the biggest criticisms levelled at\nX Wing was that, particularly on the final\nmissions, it became well nigh impossible.\nTie Fighter addressed this by having three\ndifficulty settings, ensuring that even non-entities like me could see the closing cutscenes. It was in every way better than X Wing, plus you get the added bonus of flying\nfor the empire. The storyline has\nalso been improved, with\nan intriguing subplot dealing with\na fifth column within the empire. This has\nalso been upgraded( although not as\nmuch as X Wing)\nand includes the expansion pack. It is the\nmost enjoyable of the games in this\npack, although not by much. One feature that both X Wing and Tie\nFighter lacked was the ability to blow your friends into a thousand pieces in a decent multiplayer environment. X Wing\nvs Tie Fighter was Lucasarts attempt to\naddress this problem. You can fly as\neither Imperial or Rebel pilots and in\neither co-operative or head-to-head play.\nThe graphics are the best of the three\ngames, and the flight control is excellent.\nHowever, the game lacked a coherent\nset of missions, and so fuca s arts released\nBalance of Power, a series of pre-planned\nsingle player missions. It was only partly\nsuccessful, and overall, X wing vs Tie\nFighter was not quite as good as Tie\nFighter. For some reason, Lucasarts\nhaven't included Balance of Power in\nthis pack (or if they have, they've hidden it well), instead plumping for some extra\n\"exclusive\" missions.\nAll in all, this is pretty much an essential purchase if you haven't already got\nthe games. If you have, then you have\nto make the choice as to whether or not\nthe additional upgrades are worth splashing out even more money. The games are still a joy to play of course, and these\nupgrades will help fill out the wait for X Wing: Alliance. They'll also run on lower\nspec machines than Rogue Squadron,\nand are (I think) generally better games.\nDanny\nOh No Not More Previews - LucasArts' X Wing Alliance\nIf X Wing and Tie fighter set the standards\nfor the space fighter simulator scene, X Wing Vs Tie Fighter dropped the bat ton, fell over, and then wandered off for a kip\nbehind the high jump pit. LucasArts tried\nto sort out their problem child with a new pair of running shoes (Balance of Power),\nbut in a classic case of too little too late,\nthe Decent - Freespace team sneaked into the lead.\nLucasArts has not given up that easily and their plans to sprint back into the lead with the latest release X Wing\nAlliance are almost complete. Rather\nthan starting off a fully fledged Rebel\npilot, you start as a lowly character from the family's Transport business. Here you start by flying transport and escort missions to protect the transports from rivals\nand their friends in the empire. The path\nto greatness progresses to the secret\nAlliance training grounds before you finally make it just in time for the battle\nagainst the second death star. You might have realised that this path\ninvolves flying some new craft. Transports\nsuch as the Correllian\ntransports and the famous Millenium Falc on( Yes for once you too can be Harrison\nFord).\nThe graphics and sound since X Vs Tie\nhave been slightly\ncharged up, but what will decide whether it manages to blast\nthe opposition into the cold vacuum of space is the single player game play. X vs Tie was a delight to play over a net-work with a group of friends but was a complete pain to play in single person\nmode. The story and fifty missions will\nhelp, and so we wait...and wait..and wait.\n\n"

    "content": "8 February 1999 Columns 9\nMalaysian Focus\nAll Eyes Turn to Kuala Lumpur As Celebration Ends\nO ne of the major events during the Eid-u Fitr celebration which was widely highlighted by the Malaysian local media was that 40,000 visitors turned up at the Prime Minister's official residence, Sri Perdana, for the annual open house feast. The PM, Dr.\nMahathir himself was quoted to have\nbeen \"rather surprised\" at the kind of reception received and stated that it was a show of support for the present gov-ern ment, despite months of economic uncertainty and political unrest. Interestingly enough, about a mile away from Sri Perdana, thousands of Malaysians also gathered for a similar occasion hosted by Dr. Wa nAzi zah, the wife of incarcerated opposition and so-called\nreform movement leader, Anwar Ibrahim.\nFollowing a week's break due to the Muslim celebration, Dr. Maha thir resumed work by meeting European and American fund managers in Kuala Lumpur. It was speculated beforehand that the Malaysian premier would NlkBHafiz\nannounce the lifting of the capital control measures Implem en ted last Sept em ber due to pressures\nby foreign investors.\nThe Implementation of such controls\nmeant that these investors were unable\nto withdraw their money or capital from the Malaysian markets for one year. However, the PM did not heed to these pressure s and instead only declared the possibility of imposing an exit tax in order\nto ensure a moderate outflow of capital\ncome September1999. The announcement of a raise in toll\nrates by the government after the Chinese New Year was, understandably, not\nwarmly accepted by Malaysians in general. During these hard times of eco-no mic downturn and inflation at 5.3\npercent, frequent highway users had to\nendure an increase of almost 40 per-cent. The opposition parties and non-gov-ern ment organisations\n(NGOs) quickly formed\nii m inn iii mii an alliance, the Coali\u2022 M^ \u2014 tion for Anti-Toll (CAT)\n\u2122 to protest over this\nuntimely act. This was succeeded with sporadic demonstrations\nbeing he ld at toll plazas all over the country. As a result, the government backed down and reduced the rates.\nThe PM also decided that 20 highway\nprojects are to be deferred as the same thing shall happen again and again, \"once a highway is built and tolls are\nimposed, then there are protests and people do not want to pay\".\nIn the latest development of the Anwar Ibrahim saga, the accused was ordered by the High Court Judge, Aug u stine Paul to defend himself after ruling\nthat the state prosecution did have a case over the corruption of power charges. The trial will resume on8 February allowing one week for the defense lawyers to prepare for what must be the\nmost anticipated segment of the trial.\nAnwar himself chose to be in the witness\nbox while his defense team disclosed\nthat Dr. Maha thir and a few other\nMalaysian VIPs will also be summoned to\ntestify. Amid this decision by the court,\nfresh demonstrations calling for reforms\nbroke out in the centre of the Malaysian\ncapital after almost 3 months of relative\npeace and quiet. The week before, the Cabinet revealed that an independent commission consisting of a former Attorney-General, 2 retired judges and an orthopaedic surgeon was to be established to probe into the beatings endured by Anwar Ibrahim while in\npolice custody. This followed a report by\na police investigating body that concluded some of the injuries sustained by\nthe ex-deputy premier while in detention\nwas the result of being beaten by the police. Mysteriously, the identities of the policeman or policemen involved were unknown until now. Fifty Years On\nThis year Felix celebrates its golden anniversary. In the first of a series of articles, Ed Sexton looks at how it all began.\nT he first issue of Felix appeared in\nthe corridors of Imperial College on the morning of Friday 9\nDecember,1949. Costing3 old pence( about the same as the cakes on sale\nin the New Lounge, according to a letter featured in that issue), it appears to have been well received by the college, with all 600 copies being sold before10 am. Some copies were even sold on the black market, for4 pence, prompting the editors to increase the copy number to1000 for the second issue in 1950.\nThe first issue consisted of thir-teen typed pages and a hand drawn cover page. The reason for founding Felix was summed up by the first edi tor, one EM Hughes, as follows: \"The need has been felt for sometime for a frequently published journal to comment upon the affairs of the College whilst they are still topical, and to bring to the attention of its members the activities of Clubs and Societies of which people at present know little, and knowing little, tend to care\neven less.\"\nNo change there, then. At the time Imperial already had one student publication Phoenix. Founded by HG Wells in\n1886, Phoenix was intended to be a magazine for clubs\nand societies. Its\nsomewhat ephemeral appearance, however, was one of the reasons for the formation of Felix:\n\"This is a function which clearly\ncannot be performed by THE PHOENIX, particularly since that\nestimable bird is\nnow to appear only twice a year, and so\nFelix has come to BVgMY FORTNIGHT\nmeet the need. We do not intend to encroach upon the literary field covered by THE PHOENIX; rather do we intend to be complementary to that journal, even if\nnot always complimentary.\" Oh, the wit.\nFelix rapidly took much of Phoenix' s raison d'e tre, but Phoenix still continues under the guise of Imperial's arts magazine, now produced on an annual basis (in\nfact, the editors are looking for contributions now: phoenix@ ic.a c.uk). As always, finances were high on the Union's agenda, and cash flow problems for club activities were not unheard of. The altruistic Hughes decided that \"any profits made by the paper are to be devoted to Sports Day,\nsince it appears that the Union is now so impecunious that it maybe unable to sub sid is e coaches and teas on that\nimportant occasion.\" ICU's beverages also came in for criticism on the letters\npage; \"Sir, In a mild sort of way I would like to register a bitter protest about the Union beer. Perhaps one of our own tame entomologists could rec-om mend to our so called Brewers a more virile type of Gnat.\" Full to the brim with ailing puns, the letter was signed\" Ulcerated\". Finally, what of the name, now half a century old? The only reference to its origin is contained in a somewhat cryptic remark in the editorial; \"A debt of gratitude is owed to FC Ewels for his\nsuggestion of a title. He shall be rewarded with a saucer of milk.\" More likely, I suspect, he received a pint of beer.\n\n"

My girlfriend and I immediately acted by trying to alert the people in the neighbouring rooms, turning the oven off and telephoning Southside Security. The Security Officer suggested that the fire\ndoors should be opened so to clear the smoke, despite them constantly reminding us not to prop open fire doors. On realising that this would set off the alarms he eventually said that he would come over to deal with this dangerous situation. After waiting for 20 minutes\nSecurity had not turned up.\nI have subsequently found out that\nanother student was responsible for leaving the oven on after he had finished\ncooking and had left the building. This\nhad caused a fat filled grill tray, inside the\noven, to generate the smoke and potentially produce a fire.\nI believe that this was a potentially\nserious incident that was seconds away\nfrom developing into something seri-o us.I would therefore very much like a response from Southside Security as to\nwhat they feel is a serious threat to our\nwell being in Halls and an answer as to\nwhy they did not respond to a serious fire\nwarning.\nYours faithfully,\nA concerned resident.\nWell, security, we are waiting...\nA concerned Ed\nOwning Up, Are We?\nI would like to write to claim resp on sibi l ty for the letter (Who's Afraid of the QT) last\nweek about the Estates Department.

    "content": "8 February 1999 Sport & Diversions 27\nFOOTBALL RUGBY\nIC IV 3 - 0 UCL V( Sat 23rd Jan)\nWell, what can we say? Reduced to ten men following a horrendous challenge on one of our stars, Stephen Dewar, this\ngame was perhaps the crowning point\nof our UL U season so far. Brave Stephen was rushed to hospital, and thankfully as\nnothing was broken, he should be back\nplaying in a few weeks time.\nOur jungle skills flowered under the\ngrim sky as our fourth win on the trot\naccelerated us into third place, just one spot off automatic promotion. Specifically, the touch of the elephant/ last a don was not in our ranks today. Nick, Bola,\nDave, John and Elliot had all been blessed with the skill of the racoon, and our ever-solid defence with the consistency of a yak. The first goal was born- a vivid, joyful combination terminated with\na clinical finish.\nThe stamina of the mountain billy-goat then set well in, replaced at times with the stealth of the leopard and the low cunning of the fox. Our team surged\nforward like a herd of buffalo and overcame the Shenley Scum. And then the second goal was created...and also a third...From there we held fast like a baboon colony and waited patiently for\nthe final whistle, with unshakeable confidence. For the record, two of the goals\nwere scored by Aiden, and the other by\nJohn, and thus the spirit of Pha ed on, the mighty mongoose, lives on. Thanks\nchief.\nKCL III 2 -1 IC IV\n(Wed 27th Jan)\nWhen these two teams met last term Kings won by three goals to one, I wrote,\nalbeit through gritted teeth, that \"they\nwere just that little bit too strong for us\".\nHowever in this rematch we more than\nmatched the King's dogger s in every\ntrue aspect of football, apart from those\nlittle necessities of luck, good fortunate,\nand of course, a\" home\" student referee\nwho gave every important decision to his\nteam. Man for man, every single one of our players was more skilful, more deter-mined and more committed that their\ncounterparts. Kings are comfortably at\nthe top of the division, so we can see no reason why we can't go the rest of the season undefeated, and thus finish the season promoted as either runners-up,\nor perhaps, Champions. And also theres\nBUSA; lets beat Reading, and pray we get\ndrawn away to Bath- how I'd laugh, how the old boys would love it! -1 wonder if\ntheir Union is as sh*te as it used to be...\nBack to the game, IC dominated, we had loads of chances, some badly\nmissed, others well saved. Kings scored\nafter one of their players handled and we all stopped. Again we dominated deserved getting a equalise r with five\nminutes to go( Fred crossing to the back-peg and their defender bungling the ball home under much pressure). But\nthen in the last minute a streaky cross\nfound its way to an unmarked striker 20\nyards out. He smashed it on to the cross\nbar, down to our star defender Elliot,\nwho, in trying to make a full clearance\nwas so unlucky to see the ball rebound off the bemused striker's chest into the\ngoal. Laugh?, we nearly cried.\nOn separate note, it was interesting\nto see three union sabbaticals on that\nWednesday afternoon, two playing football and one watching. One rule for one,\none for another? -nice, ICU.\nIC I520 Aberystwyth\nThe Welsh people came to Harlington\nand they were very fat. Aberystwyth is\nthe biggest pie factory in Wales and sheep are the main ingredient. The\nWelsh had two secret weapons. As kickoff approached, 2 members of the team removed their hats to reveal their ginger\nhair. Luckily it didn't rain. As the game progressed, it became clear that the entire team were related and had a sheepish look to them. Despite their\nobvious deformities, their defence contained no \"leeks\" (Ok, now you pushing it - Sports Ed). Perhaps the highlight of the game was Matt \"these shorts can't contain my arse\" Cockay stamping on Welshman' s\" rare bit\", and then proc ee ding to flop over for a try. Unfortunately whilst we were trying to work out\nthe family tree, the Cymru supporters\nscored a few tries. Bring on devolution,\nwe don't want them anyway.\nIC II 5 - 29 Chichester II\nWe faced an unknown challenge but it\nwas quite a pleasant day. Pete brought\nhis videocamera to film some hardcore action, but unfortunately we were on the receiving end. We got a severe\nbr using instead, yet we held our ends for\nthe first half. Their national standard and immense size made us red, raw and sore. Our rear guard action held dignity\nfor most of the first half. However, after\nsome playful behaviour and punishing penetration by the opposition we gave\nway and yielded to their advances. Score at this time50. After half time refreshment, we pounded ahead eventhough we were constantly aching. Thanks to Bully's technique we had our balls constantly at\ntheir feet.\nMeanwhile Good Old Jim \"super-speed\"\nSopper scored a try that was the highlight of the match.\nIC III 4 -2 Nothampton Exiles\nThere are some certainties in life - the creation, Birth, Death and a3 XV team forming5 mins before the match! What\nwas unusual was that the pull of this first\nBUSA cup knockout match had attracted\nreserves and lots of them! Our opposition were, frankly, Herculean!\nNot one was under 6'2\" or 17 stone. We,\non the other hand, to a man, lithe, slight\nand smart. The match started and after\nsome clumsy play by the op posit on, we had a scrum - we had little chance and were driven back. We soon worked to\nthe we ak ne sse s of these steroid monsters, damage broke through eventually,\nand then with characteristic co-ordination, linked with the entire back\nline...leading to Gut mound diving over\nfor ur only4 points. The rest of the game was simple to-ing and fro-ing,\nuntil, just before the final whistle, the exiles scored their two points.\nThe result was a testament to intelligent\nplay outwitting fat-bags with football\nIQ's!

    "content": "20 Arts 8 February 1999\nAFRICA BY AFRICA: A PHOTOGRAPHIC VIEW\nBarbican Art Gallery\nT his show explores the work of African photographers from the past\n70 years. The first display dates back\nto the 1930s, portraying numerous families. Most of the images represent traditional aspects of African life; the inside\nof houses, women in typical costumes and couples dressed up for special occasions. The next section presents an incredible amount of portraits by Mama Casset, A zag lo and Keita. A zag lo places\nhis models outdoors, using men and women alike. Keita, on the other hand, comes up with a brilliant self-portrait, always\npicturing groups or subjects lying down. His funniest piece has to be\nthe two babies (pic-tu red left). These photos are touching and very moving. The next\nbig room focuses on work from South Africa.\nMost of them are taken\nfrom Drum magazine which had an immense Impact and influence on life in the country.\nWe get to see a young and charismatic Nelson Mandela, lots of\ndancing and singing in jazz clubs as well\nas a rare, early photograph of the greatest African singer, Miriam Makeba. The\n70s are typified as glamorous partying,\nrevealing the influence of Pop culture on Africa. Samuel Fosso's series captures\nthe spirit of this turbulent decade. He has\ntaken several tremendously intense,\nhumorous and original self-portraits. He is dressed differently in every single picture - it looks like a fashion shoot really.\nThe exhibition seems to skip the 80s and we land instead in the modernism and wildness of the90 s. Both sections are\noutstanding. First, Apa gya creates a set\nof studio portraits against different back-drops, even providing the gallery with\none. We therefore get an idea of the effects created by photography from a very basic piece of equipment. The last\npart of the exhibition is dedicated to contemporary South African photographers, with a tremendous variety of work\non display. Mofo keng' s series has a very\nmystic and haunting feeling to it. Tshabangu shows the harder\nside of life in the town ships. Finally, M the thw a injects a lot of colour into his photos, resulting in a splendidly happy\nand optimistic outlook.\nThis show is very\ninspiring. It discloses\nmany facets of Africathe contrasting hardship\nand enjoyment. We also\ndiscover that some artists are pushing boundaries, producing very original and creative work. It is a great\nshame that these artists don't get more\nattention in our Western culture. The\nexhibition is definitely worth seeing, especially if you don't know much about\nAfrican artists. You will discover a world\nfull of poetry.\nD. Until 28th March Nearest tube; Barbican\nAdmission: \u00a36, concessions \u00a34\nCINDERELLA\nWimbledon Theatre\nAs a mature, serious and ultra-sophisticated theatre goer, I was more than slightly apprehensive about seeing the glittery children's spectacle that is Cinderella. Well, okay, there\nwas one attraction - one of my all-time\nheroes Kriss Aka bus i was in it, which more than made up for the sad lack of cx-Neighbours characters in the cast.\nI seriously doubted the entertainment value of shouting at grown men and women to look behind them, and while trying to fend off inquisitive prods\nand several attempts at conversation by\na horde of small children, I squeezed myself into the pint-sized chair. I was however determined to keep an open mind, even after the melodramatic drum roll and stylised introductory song boasting the merits of Cadbury's, and how well\na bar of Cadbury's would go with the per-form ance, and would we like to go to the\nfoyer and get - you guessed it - some Cadbury's. Once the play got started though, I was captivated. The sets were consistently breathtaking, and perfectly fantastic al, while the costumes were extravagant, inventive and, in the case of the two ugly sisters, often ridiculous and hilarious.\nAs a person with what could be described as a somewhat juvenile sense\nscene about cats. There were in fact perhaps a few too many 'adult' jokes that\nwould have passed over the kids' heads,\nbut still served to entertain.\nof humour, I found myself creasing up at\nthe gags (although don't expect even a hint of subtlety). An excellent ventriloquist, woven into the plot on a very\nvague pretext, earned his presence if\nonly on the strength of a single, funny\nAs with all pantomimes, the children\nin the audience were an important part\nof the show, giving us all an excuse to indulge ourselves as well as them. And they didn't let us down. They responded with expertise at all the right moments, and chirped up with endearing comments at all the wrong moments. They\nthemselves provided a rich source of entertainment when Bradley Walsh as\nButtons enticed some young' vol unt eet s' to perform a variety of embarrassing activities on stage.\nIncidentally, Kriss didn't let me down either - he was witty, and of course very\nenthusiastic. His complete lack of any\nsinging ability was cleverly masked, and his role in 'Record Breakers' was milked\nto the full, providing the subject for a range of jokes.\nOn the whole, the music was a little\ncorny and not very original, using songs\nlifted from several well-known musicals.\nThere were however some memorable tunes as well as some excellent dances.\nThe hunting scene in particular stands\nout as a lively, well choreographed and feverishly dramatic piece of work.\nOverall, the perfect pantomime, wonderfully capturing the fantasy of the\nfairy tale and also of Christmas (if a little\nbelatedly). A great laugh. But you'll have\nto wait until next year to see It... Sorry!\nJudy\n\n"

    "content": "12\nReviews\nFilm 8 February 1999\nVery Bad Things * * * *\nStarring : Cameron Diaz, Christian Slater, Jon Favreau, Leland Orser, Jeremy Piven, Daniel Stern\nDirector: Peter Berg\nDespite the fact that they' ve never been in anything that\ncould actually be branded with\nthe adjective ' good', both of Very Bad\nThings stars have managed to build\nthemselves extraordinary fanbase s around the globe. Cameron Diaz has become a major\nHollywood player thanks to amazing looks combined with an astute choice of roles ( eschewing the traditional line\nof blonde bimbos and rom-com hero ines), plus an unexpected level of talent.\nChristian Slater, however, has taken a more off-beat route to stardom. In the late-eighties he was a teenage pin-up,\nbut in the nineties he has stormed through an eclectic mix of movies, followed by increasingly outrageous stories\nof drug abuse somehow managing to\nkeep that trademark roguish grin intact.\nThus, whilst Diaz maybe on less\nfamiliar territory in the movies he' s just too nice to play a convincing rich-bitch - Slater is in his element. He leads\na group of five late-twenties blok es to Las Vegas, where they plan to stage the greatest bachelor party ever, to celebrate. It turns wild, and amidst a massive\nA bunch of pissed, leering good for no th lng blok es. It's all strangely familiar.\ndrink and drug fuelled binge a prostitute\nis accidentally murdered. Slater moves into gear, spouting pop-psychology and rising to every (increasingly brutal) act\nwhich his escape plan requires. Mean while, of course, his friends are falling\nto pieces. Hysteria and full-on nervous\nbreakdown coupled with guilt and panic\nsoon lead to lethal wrangles, and, of course, an hilarious finale. Juxtaposed\nagainst these horrific actions arc Diaz's sublimely screwy attempts to ensure the wedding goes to plan. Which it\ndoes. Sort of.\nIn essence, Very Bad Things is Shallow Crave with laughs. If that sounds like a pretty sick concept then that's because it is. Remember the scene in\nShallow Crave where Ewan McGregor and Christopher Ecclestone goto the DIY shop to buy a spade, a saw and a hammer? That scene is mirrored here,\nonly this time they buy chainsaws, breathing apparatus and a lot of suit-cases. Which they put the dismembered torsos in. Yet it's hilarious - somehow writer/director Berg manages to create\na world detached from reality, where you know that these events aren't real\n- and thus someone standing in a bath\ncutting up a corpse with a chainsaw is\nfunny. Odd. To enjoy Very Bad Things you'll have\nto be of a certain disposition, with the\nability to laugh at undeniably nasty acts.\nYet if you can you'll find yourself heavily rewarded, with fine performances from two of Hollywood' s most likable\nstars, some great ensemble moments and a series of brilliant twists in the last\nten minutes, in which nearly every character receives their comeuppance. D Dave\nShakespeare in Love * * * * *\nStarring : Gwyneth Paltrow, Joseph Fiennes, Geoffrey Rush, Ben Affleck, Judi Dench, Colin Firth, Simon Callow\nDirector: John Madden\nGolden Globe Award already In the bag. Oscar to come?\nYou' ve probably heard all the hype about Shakespeare in Love\nalready, so it needs no intro duc tion - except to say it's brilliant and go and see it now! There simply isn't anything bad to say about this film at\nall.\nThe film has been so well thought out and the script cleverly put together, with the same blend of in-jokes, period detail and wit that made writer Tom Stoppard' s other Shakespearean parodies( Rosencrantz and\nGuildenstern Are Dead and The Fifteen Minute Hamlet) so successful on both stage and screen. If you have a working knowledge of' Romeo and Juliet' by the bard himself then most of the puns will work for you, but even if you have n't it doesn't matter.\nSet in London in1593, Joseph Fiennes is believable as Shakespeare. He seems to possess all the wit and intelligence present in Shakespeare' s work. And as for Gwyneth Paltrow as\nthe lovely Viola De Lesseps, well, you'll\nhave to makeup your own mind. Don't go thinking this actress can't do an English accent because she has\nshown the whole world in this film she is a brilliant performer and the ultimate 'Eng li sh Rose'. Shakespeare and Viola meet when she auditions for a part in his new play ' Romeo and Ethel the Pirate's Daughter'. The only snag is women aren't allowed to perform on the stage. He discovers her true identity\nand quickly take s her to be his new Muse who inspires him to turn his play into a tragic love story called' Romeo and Juliet'. As always, the course of true love is n eve r easy. Viola\nis betrothed to someone else and the rest you will have to find out for\nyourself. Almost every five minutes a recognisable face turns up including members of the 'Fast Show', Martin Clunes,\nand Geoffrey Rush (star of Shine and Elizabeth). Making a star appearance is Dame Judi Dench as Queen Elizabeth. The resemblance between these\ntwo women is so startling that Dench could have been Elizabeth in a former life.\nAlthough this film is dreadfully romantic, it isn'ta 'chick flick' - just the\nbest film of1999 so far.D Helen\n\n"

My first one and a half years were\nessentially training posts, allowing me to finish my\nMPDS and gain Chartered Status with the IMechE.\nJobs ranged from project engineer in a refinery\n(edible oil), to Quality Engineer in a margarine factory\nin Germany, to Commissioning Engineer installing a \u00a32.2m packing line in the main factory.\nMy first management position was in Worksop, as\nthe Project Support Manager for setting up the\nChicken Tonight factory. This was a \u00a34m project which\nwe had 7 months to install and commission a brand\nnew factory, recruit and train a workforce to run the\nfactory and get the product to the shelves. My next\npost was as Process Development Manager - a natural\nprogression from the previous job, enabling me to\nhelp sort out any problems incurred on the Chicken\nTonight Line.\nI am now the Internal Logistics Manager for the\nMargarine factory (where I started out). I control all\ngoods leaving and entering the site and the pallet ising of the cases of margarine onto pallets. I have 30\npeople who work for me, dispatch approximately\n1,000,000 tubs of margarine a day, and receive the\nmaterials to make that each day. I am responsible\nfor ongoing improvements within my area including\nmany large projects such as Automatic Guided Vehicle\nimplementation and installation of computer systems\nsuch as SAP. The factory where I work was voted the\nbest factory in the UK last year - not bad for a food\nfactory.\nSo, I have been with Unilever for 5 years, had 6\ndifferent jobs, worked on 3 different sites and have\ndoubled my starting salary.

As part of my training, I also\nattended Hazard and Operability studies of toothpaste\nplants, and visited fabric a tors.I then moved to Birds Eye Wall's in Lowestoft, East\nAnglia. I spent 6 months in their technical support\ncentre, doing glamorous site projects including\ndesigning a new leading edge effluent treatment\nplant, utilities targeting and monitoring, and pea\nfreezer development. I moved into the beefburger\nfactory for 4 months and was a Shift Manager,\nresponsible for 3 operating lines and 40 people,\ndoing 12 hour day and night shifts. It was a change\nof lifestyle but great fun and I learnt loads.\nI then spent a4 month placement working as the\nAssistant Brand Manager for Vaseline Intensive Care\nand Dove deodorant at Elida Faberge in Kingston,\nLondon. I looked at multilingual packs for Europe,\nwas responsible for the promotion of Vaseline deo,\nand was involved in advert production which included\ngoing to the shoot at Pinewood studios! This was my\nfirst taste of a non-technical role and it was very\ndifferent to what I was used to, great fun and lots of\nshowbiz parties. At the end of last year I returned to\nthe Unilever Corporate Manufacturing and Supply\nChain Technolgy (MAST) Group in Port Sunlight in\nmy first management position, working on shampoo\nand ice-cream projects for Unilever's emerging\nmarkets all over the world and value engineering\nstudies in many operating companies.\nThe variety of experiences that Unilever has offered\nme have been very enjoyable as well as challenging.\nAll the people I have met along the way have\nbeen very supportive and I think the company\noffers exciting future opportunities.\nGrads do...\nSl/ lOt i CsAgTER. KARL X> Wki\\\u00a3\nChemical Engineering 1979 -1983\nMy \"gut feel\" was that I would fit in with Unilever's culture: so I accepted their offer of a place on the Wirral,\nwith Van den Bergh Foods, on their management trainee\nscheme which I undertook for 1 year. After a further 2\nyears as a Shift Manufacturing Manager responsible for\n98 employees operating 20 production lines in the\nMargarine factory, I was transferred to a sister factory at\nPurfleet, near London. Here my initial responsibilities\nincluded being a member of the project team that\nreconfigured the edible fat spreads manufacturing\ncapabilities to meet the changing needs of the business.\nThe task took 3.5 years and \u00a316m to complete and\nconsisted of the specification, design, and commissioning\nof new plant and equipment together with the\nassociated PLC and Management Information systems.\nOn completion the site was (and remains) Unilever's largest edible fats factory in the world. Then I became\none of the two Plant Managers running the day to day\noperation of the factory which was operating 7 days per\nweek, throughout the year, with 220 people in their area\nof responsibility.\nIn 19921 transferred to The Netherlands to work in a group responsible for the identification of Best Practice in\nedible fats manufacture and the transfer of this\nknowledge world-wide to all relevant Unilever operating\ncompanies. In 19961 returned to Port Sunlight in the UK\nand now run the Supply Chain Strategy Team within\nUnilever's corporate supply chain group. The group's mission is to transfer Leading Practice in Manufacturing\nand Supply Chain to Unilever's businesses.\nGraduates joining Unilever to work within the supply\nchain will have a key role to play in realising the\nsignificant potential for value creation that exists within\nthis area. Efficient design and operation of the supply\nchain has a major impact on the meeting of customer\nand consumer needs and therefore\non business performance. The ^^^^^^^^^^\nMechanical Engineering 1991 -1995\nI had never thought that 'company culture'\nmattered that much to me until I really had to make\na decision. That was how I came to join Unilever\nthrough the Milk Round and started working for\nBirds Eye Wall's in 1995 as a technical trainee.\nMy first job was as a Project Manager in a Beefburger factory, and this role soon progressed\nto Shift Manager. At this point, the BSE scare\ndestroyed the Beefburger market and\nmanagement of the factory became a very day-to-day role. Some of my focus was to commission\nthe 'Birds Eye Meatfree' production line which I continued to run - operationally co-ordinating a team of 5 Shift Managers.\nAfter 1 year, I moved to a Sales role in Head Office,\nfollowed by a Logistics job, re-engineering a business process and developing a materials\nrequirement planning tool for Ice Cream\npackaging. After 4 months I moved to my current\nrole in Ice Cream Manufacturing at Gloucester,\nwhere I am the Operations Projects Manager for\nEurope's largest Ice Cream factory. I have mostly\nbeen involved with implementing an annual is ed hours system, engineering improvement work and\nTotal Productivity Management. I am now\nresponsible for the installation and commissioning\nof \u00a36 million worth of new production line.\nOne of the best things I find about Unilever is the\npeople, at all levels. The people I work with in the\nfactory are all excellent, and a complete cross\nsection of society. The senior members of the\nbusiness are very genuine and great to work for.\nMy peer group are all great friends stretching\nacross all the Unilever companies, which facilitates\nan excellent social life. I spent my summer holiday\nthis year visiting a friend who works\nfor Unilever Vietnam, which was\nfantastic! . ^\n\n"

He believes he has switched the focus on to the day-to-day issues\nwhich really affect students - like Lond on Transport, the library and health-centre, and discounts. Consequently, he' d like\nhis year in office to be remembered as \" the year the Union came back to the students\".\nAlongside this, he' d also like to be remembered for setting\nsome longer term projects in motion like the expansion into Beit Quad and the proposed Union Job Shop (both due to begin in Summer2000). Dave has also\nput a lot of emphasis on Student Develo p ment, and hopes to set up a \"Student\nDevelopment Week\" for next year.\nNonetheless, he admits that he has\nmanaged to achieve far less this year\nthan he had initially hoped,\" problems with clubs, the CC U's and UL Use em to eat up my time\". The workload has also\ncome as something of a shock to the system, \"the level of administration is\nhuge, and, for the most part, thank-less\".\n\"the year the\nUnion came back\nto the students\"\nOn the other hand, Dave sees one of the biggest plus points of the job as\nthe opportunity for lots of public speak-ing and meeting people. Indeed this\nmay prove to be only the first step on the road to power although Dave has\ndecided that he hates \"Politics with a big\nP\",he is looking to work in the Foreign\nOffice or with the UN\" and I wouldn't mind being an Ambassador\". So what makes a good President? According to Dave, you simply\ncan't tell who would do the job well,\" you just have to listen to what they promise to do, and hope they focus on the issues\". He admits\nthat he is far from perfect \"you need someone who' s more responsible than\nme in the way they administer the Union, but who won't let constitutional\njargon get in the way of doing the job properly\".\nAnd would he do the job again?\nDave is a fervent believer in the bene fits of allowing sabbaticals to run for a second term, but wouldn't want to do it himself. \"I wouldn't be fully involved,\nan dI'd get even more egotistic than Iam now. I 've had my chance its time\nto let someone else have their go.\" Marie Nicholaou\nDeputy President\n(Clubs & Societies)\nOnly a month into her (shortened) sabbatical term, ti is difficult to gauge the performance of ICU's newest s abb, Marie Ni chola ou. Nonetheless, she claims her time has been in high demand, dealing with the Health& Safety\nissues which she views as incredibly important. Key to this has been the potential dangers of the\nWeights Gym and problems of noise In\nSouthside basements both of which she hopes will soon reach satisfactory\noutcomes. Marie, however, readily admits that\nshe has no grand plan for her seven months in office. \"If I'd had some good ideas I would have run for the full\ntwelve months... l haven't had enough time to formulate a grand plan\". Thus,\nshe is concerned more with dealing\" I haven't had\ntime to formulate\na grand plan\"\nwith the next crisis than leaving any lasting impression on the Union. In\nyears to comes he simply hopes that\nshe is remembered for \"trying to help all sports - and trying not\nto be too biased towards\nmy own... But I 've\nfailed\". Like Dave, Marie sees the opportunity to meet new people every\nday as one of the biggest plus points\nof the job. On the other hand, the worst part lies in the admin which run-ning150 clubs required, \"I haven't written anything for four years, and now I 've got to write all these reports...I 've\nforgotten how.\" So what makes an ideal DP(C& S)? \"You need someone patient and tolerant who has an open mind on every\nissue\". time.

Despite the\nfact that problems continue to stream in,\nChris believes that the training was very\nworthwhile, \"it was worth giving training to the medics, even if they ignored it. I just wish I'd taken a list of who was there\".\nThe really big issues\nthis year, as far as Chris is concerned, have been the Beit Expansion and minibuses. Both of these issues have\n\u2022 seen a great deal of progress (with the\nUnion doing surprisingly well In Beit),\nbut it will take along time for the results\nto filter through. \"That's one of the big\nproblems with this job1 know I won't be here to see the outcome of my actions\".\nChris also has to accept that a big\npart of his job involves damage limit a tion. Moreover, everything below \u00a3500\nis basically delegated down, soho wever conscientious he is, \" there will\nalways be a big mess\". Indeed Chris\nsees this as the worst part of his job, \"the\n\"if I could do\nthe job again\nwould do\"\nMed School is a complete mess...l can't be expected to perform miracles for\nthose who don't play by the rules.\nNonetheless, he is still pleased with how things have gone this year - particularly his working relationship with\nPresident Hellard, \"At the beginning of the year I was concerned that someone who wasn't involved with the Union had the potential to make huge mistakes.\nBut he' s actually done really well\". So would Chris stand\nfor election again, given the chance? \"If I could stand again I would do. When the new rector is\nappointed we should push really hard\nfor the right for two year sabbaticals\".\nMoreover there is one important less on which Chris has learnt, \" if I was starting the year over, I wouldn't rely on a detailed chain of command I'd get detailed information to everyone per-son ally\". Asked what makes a good DP (F&S), the answer is simple, \"It's the one role\nwhere you need someone really cap a ble, yet tolerant, who can say more than\njust ' No'.\" And what' s the best thing about the job? \"That pseudo sense of power\". Ed Sexton\nFelix Editor\nEd Sexton's manifesto promised three\nthings: greater publicity, a higher standard\nof writing and reps at every campus. Whilst\nhe has had great success with the first\ntwo, Ed admits to having\nhad more trouble with the\nlatter, \"I made half an effort,\nbut there didn't seem to be\nany interest\". However, Ed\nis very happy with the improvements made in the\nreviews sections this year, particularly in arts\nand games. Above all else, he'd like to be remembered for being \"relaxed, approachable and considerate of both sides of the\nargument\".\nAlongside this, Ed also believes that the\nrelationship with the Union has changed\nthis year. \"Felix has become much more pro-Union - we'll still attack them when necessary, but in general we're both on the\nsame side\".\nSo would he do the job again? \"No, but\nnot because I'm not enjoying it - it's just not\nsomething you want to do for more than\n\"relaxed,\napproachable\nand considerate\"\nthirteen months\". There are things he'd like\nto do differently If he started the year over.\nAn important lesson is that people will only\ndo things if you speak to them personally,\nface-to-face, \"so I'd spend\nmore time out of the office,\nrather than constantly emaiL\ning and phoning people\".\nMoreover, given the opportunity Ed believes he would\nhave tried far harder to keep\nFelix coming out on Friday's. One thing the year has taught Ed is the\nmyriad of abilities which the ideal Felix editor needs to embody. \"You need to have\nthe technical knowledge; a genuine like of\nstudent interests,- the ability to see the difference between what someone writes\nand who they are; and you have to be able\nto write 400 words at six in the morning,\nhaving been awake for 24 hours\".\nAnd what's the best thing about the\njob? \"Walking around on Monday after-noon s and seeing thousands of students\nleafing through their copy of Felix.\"\nJRjT \u00b0 r Felix\nMfr dt-pr tdi ji\nW<r he tdi to t but on\nih s ud rs who vol-their time to\nmake it the professional\npublication it is.

    "content": "News 8 February 1999\nMachines that conceive of blue bananas\nThe City & Guilds Centenary Lecture\nseries got off to a highly successful start last week, thanks to a talk from one of IC's foremost research engineers, Igor Alexander. The lecture series is designed to commemorate the centenary of C&G Union, and will\nhighlight some of the major engineering achievements of the last 100\nyears.\nProfessor Alexander is one of the foremost world authorities on artificial\nintelligence, frequently quoted both on TV and radio, and combines this\nwith the role of Pro-Rector. His talk,\nentitled ' Engineering in Nature( and those who cracked it)' focused on the development of Al over the last forty\nyears, and his changing relationship with his subject. He went to university\nin South Africa before the days of computers and even transistors, and thus,\non graduation, he envisioned a life-time spent designing valve amps. This all changed after he heard a lecture on communication given by IC\nProfessor Glen Cherry, \" which taught me that engineering principles could be applied to the study of society\". From this - seemingly innocuous beginning, he started to\" examine By David Roberts\n:\ny:':\"/'L:'.>'::: Photo: Courtesy of Imperial College\nwhat is meant by emotions and experience\", and how, on a more practical\nlevel, this can be applied to robot and android design. In the early sixties, he followed closely in the footsteps of MIT expert\nWarren McCulloch, who first developed the concept of cybernetics. But\nthese early concepts were not followed through, thanks to the \"cult of the omnipotent programmer\" young designers who believed that the prog ram mer could overcome every ob st a cle (rather than the machine having to\n' learn' how to deal with them). Thus,\nit was not until twenty years after\nMcCulloch, in 1 9 6 3 , that Alexander designed the first digital neurone, which had the ability to general is e results and turn them into learning. By\nadding such neurone s together he developed systems of pattern recognition, which, when embedded in\ncomplex feedback loops, generates a simple neural network. These systems have now developed into a programme with the ability to identify shapes and colours, which allows an amazing perceptive ability. Prof Alexander demonstrated this with a picture of a Martian land-scape; given some basic knowledge of features on Earth, it can detect rocks\nand hillside, and can track down more interesting features. More impressively\nstill, it has the ability to' visualise' objects it hasn eve r seen which he demonstrated by asking the computer to imagine a blue banana with red\nspots. This, he believes, is the first step\non the road to a' conscious' computer which, if his book is to be believed, he has done, in the shape of a machine called' Magnus'. Thus there was one message which Professor Alexander wanted to\nImpart on his audience, \"to bean engineer is to understand things even those that happen in nature\".

From the outset he warned the receptive audience that\nhis public speaking was so soporific that it\nhad been known to send him to sleep\nwhile he was making the speeches. Maintaining this light-hearted tone he quoted\nhow one national paper had characterised\nhis in congruence with the re-vamped\nLabour Party: \"He is to New Labour what\nthe Norweigian entry is the Furovision\nsong contest.\"\nMr Dobson used his time to focus on the current stability and future prospects of the NHS, introducing the topic by describing the values underpinning \"the most\npopular institution in Britain by a very considerable distance\". Describing its \"quality\nand equality\", he contended that its success\nand incomparable convenience were derived from it being purely tax-funded,\nand went on to state the Government's responsibility to the system \"is to try to\nmake sure the things that are wrong with\nthe Health Service - and there are things\nBy Andrew Ofori\nwrong with it - are put\nrig hl and it is placed\nin a position where it\ncan cope with the\nvarious challenges\nand changes of the\ncoming century.\"\nThe Health Secretary then launched\nan attack on how|\" pointy headed\" economists temper his best intentions\nwith considerations\nsuch as the pop ul a tion's increasing 1\nlongevity, new pharmaceuticals, and|| innovation in treat- I ment; factors which j they view as sources \u2022\nof excess pressure on Photo: Jonas Dobson deep In thought\nthe NHS of the future. He insisted that the demographics\nof the population indicated there can only\nbe an ease in the current strain on the s ys tem.\n\"To put the NHS in a position where it\ncan cope with admittedly new challenges,\"\nwas how Mr Dobson assessed his current\nrole. To this end there\nwould need to be more money invested\nin the system, and a consequent improve-ment in equipment and the working environment. Above all\nDobson called for a vast development in\nworking practice,\nfinding the news media too often\nengrossed in the punitive measures meted\nto those who are at\nfault, he expounded the virtues of ensuring a high quality service from the outset.\nThe required standard of education and training could be achieved \"by the systematic spread of best practice and the\nmonitoring of that best practice.\"\nThe Cabinet Minister ended his speech\nby opening the floor to questions, where-upon he was subjected to a forthright and\nsalient session of questioning. In answer\nto the claim that the NHS survives on a vast\namount of overtime put in by doctors, Mr Dobson agreed that the system is maintained by the hard work of all NHS staff. He remarked that he in fact had an appointment with the Prime Minister later that\nday where he would discuss a pay increase\nfor medical staff next week. He also presented the opposing view, claiming he often spoke to members of the medical fraternity who complained that there colleagues did not work hard enough, to\nwhich he would reply \"you know who they\nare, you do something about it.\"\nThe Secretary of State later found it\nnecessary to qualify his stance on the\nselective administration of drugs, in particular the controversial Viagra. He reminded people that \"it's the National\nHealth Service not the National Recreational Service.\"\nChelsea Lose at Harlington\nChelsea suffered a de moral ising loss\nrecently, but on this occasion it was not\nat the hands of Arsenal. While the Premiership team was training at Harlington\non28 January, their changing rooms were raided and six unfortunate members of the team lost valuable posses-s ions. Harlington, the Imperial College Union Sports Ground, houses Imperial\nCollege and Chelsea FC changing rooms in a single building, with Chelsea's facilities being cordoned off from the col-leg e's section. The parties also run these\nfacilities separately; Chelsea provide their\nown security in the form of two guards,\nbut as stated by Mick Reynolds, Harlington's Head Groundsman, the thieves\nclearly \"got past them easily.\" Uni m pressed with such inept security he continued:\" someone just walked in and By Andrew Ofori\nChelsea's Glanfranco Zola Is far from pleased with the loss\nhelped themselves.\"\nThe discovery was made when the\nplayers were changing after showers -and various members of the team noticed some of their personal a effects\nhad disappeared. I our watches with a total value of \u00a318,000, a wrist bracelet\nworth \u00a31,000 and a significant amount of\ncash were missing. The thieves' haul was believed to total around \u00a320,000.\nThe Police have mounted an extensive investigation involving the CID. A Scotland Yard spokesman refused to identify the specific victims, and merely\ncommented \"It appears to have been a fairly straight forward theft while the players were out training.\" Chelsea have\nupgraded security measures at Harlingt on, with staff locking all doors and patrolling corridors, but as Mr Reynolds\nput it \"unfortunately it's a little bit too late.\"\nInside..m Letters 6\nColumns 8\nFilm 12\nSabb Interviews 14\nMusic 16\nArts 20\nClubscene 22\nGames 24\nSport 26\nCrossword 28\n\n"

Disney came up with the idea of a computer gene rated flick about ants and Dreamworks stole the idea and made it bigger and better. It's very difficult not to com pare these two films, as they are so similar.\ntor those of you who haven't seen AntzXhis film will be spectacular with its\nbrilliant animation and cute story line.\nMind you, as with all Disney films the trailers exposed all the best bits. If you listen carefully you will hear the voices of Kevin Spacey, David Hyde Pierce\n(a.k.a. Niles from Frasier), Phyllis Diller\nand John Ratzenberger( from Cheers).\nThe story line is the same as with Antz. Flik (Foley) is an individual with fantastic ideas about how to improve the colony on Ant Island but having ideas is not ' normal' when you' re an ant. He is considered a little odd by almost everyone and his ideas get him into trouble. So much trouble in fact\nthat he is sent away for help to save the tr^ b^aEN Jr^ if if ifr \u00abr CGI ten times more powerful than that used on Toy Story. Wow.\ncolony from the grasshoppers. After\nseeing this film you will never look at\na grasshopper in the same light again. He finds what he thinks is a troop of warriors but they turn out to be a circus\ngroup. However, don't worry, as in all\ngood Disney films the good guy wins and gets the girl.\nWhereas Antz was full of 'adult'\njokes this has a sense of humour aimed at children. It's definitely not a film for\nall age groups to enjoy but go and see it anyway. Q Helen\nYour Friends & Neighbours * * *\nStarring : Amy Brenneman, Nastassja Kinski, Jason Patric, Ben Stiller\nDirector: Neil LaBute\nT here are certain directors who clearly aren't too happy with their\nlot in life, filling every movie they\nmake with death, depression and suffering - and Neil LaBute is one such\nman.\nHis debut movie. In the Company of Men, saw two heartless office workers\ndating, then dumping a frail deaf girl just\nbecause they wanted to hurt someone, and Your Friends & Neighbours presents\nmore of the same. Consequently, the cast consists of Patric's social evil in car nate; a wife who won't be touched( Brennerman); a quarrelling couple who are cheating on each other (Stiller and Keener); a husband who practices his\nown brand of self-loving (Aaron Eckhart);\nand a drip py lesbian (Kinski).\nAmerican indie movies of this kind -deliberately low budget and lo-fi - live and die on the strength of their cast, and it's here that Your Friends shows its depth. All\nCGI ten times more powerful than that used on Toy Story. Wow.\nof the six principle actors are on top form, but its Patric who storms through\nwith a grandstanding performance, filled\nwith tales of date-rape and 'revenge' sex.\nLike I said, LaBute is not a happy man.\nFilled with gags which you'll feel\nuncomfortable laughing at, endlessly\nquotable dialogue and a warped sense of\nfun, your take on the movie will ultimately depend on your own views (and\nexperience) of sex. [ J Dave\nCompetition winners will be announced next week.\nThe X Files\nIn the face of a barrage of TV to movie\nadaptations that have proved just how easy it is to make a bad film, The X Files\nMovie is a refreshing change which stays very true to its roots. Consequently\nthe film plays very much in the style of an extended episode of the hit s cries. The increased budget is obvious, but\nsensibly utilised, and the much vaunted\nplot exposes simply leave even more\nunanswered questions. Most importantly, Mulder and Scully don't 'get it on'( as Barry White would say).\nThe difficult bit of any TV to movie\ntransition is how to cater for both the\nlong-term fan and the newcomer, and its here that The X Files really succeeds.\nA couple of entertaining 'hello, this is\nwho we are' scenes get that out of the\nway early on, and from there on it's plain sailing into a truly breath-taking\nfinale.\nThe Avengers\nTo be honest, I didn't actually think The\nAvengerswas that bad. There arc some nice ideas on show; the cast aren't at all\nbad; and( surprisingly) it struggles to\nretain the spirit of the original. However,\nI'm not one to walk in the face of public opinion on such matters, and it's undeniably true that The Avengers is a mess. Edited to bits, it simply makes no\nsense in places, and is utter indulgence\nin others (Eddie Izzard and Shaun Ryder\nin a mini, chasing Lima Thurman and\nRalph Fiennes with radio-control wasps).\nIt's only redeeming feature is the sight\nof Sean Connery in a giant teddy-bear\ncostume. Species 2\nSometime back in July I went to the cine ma with a group of friends to see The\nWedding Singer. One of the trailers was\nfor Species 2. If was so bad we started\nto laugh. We were still laughing after\nthree more trailers. We still couldn't stop\nlaughing when the movie itself began\nto roll. We only stopped laughing when a very well-built usher told us that if we didn't shut up he' d throw us out. As far\nas I'm concerned, that's not a good sign. Even my blind-desperate friends -the ones who liked Showgirls - didn't like Species 2. Be warned. D Dave\n\n"

    "content": "8 February 1999 Music\nAlbums\nDREAM CITY FILM CLUB\nIn The Cold Light Of Morning,\nDespite the fluffy name, one\nband member still Insists on\nlooking like a menace.\nT his album is depressing. If\nyou're looking for something to\nperk you up in the morning, to lift you up when you're feeling low,\ndon't look here. This is more likely to send you scuttling to a dark corner\nwhere you will want to wallow in a pit of your own despair and insecurities. The music in general has Goth stamped all\nover it. It's dark, per vy and morose. Having said that, Dream City film\nClub have let up a little since their eponymous first album. That was a harsh and depraved look at modern life, described\nin the press as ' a discordant blob of sonic grease' and' a filthy sore of a record,' as well as 'pretty fucking horr i ble, all told,' by the NME. For this, their\nsecond album, there is less emphasis on grating rawness and more of their\nmelodies and sensitivities can shine through. The album opens with the beautifully poignant Killer Blow. It's quiet and thoughtful, and hence totally uncharacteristic of the rest of the album. Most of the songs are loud and raucous, with an\nemphasis on sounding like a live record-ing. Bizarrely, Track 9 Country Paranoia\nhas exactly the same intro as Killer Blow.\nMaybe they could only think up one quiet bit and so had to use it again.\nKerrang! Magazine voted Billy Chic\nsingle of the week and it's easy to see why with its punchy power chords and hard rhythm drumming. Singer Michael J. Sheehy's voice is\nsurprisingly dynamic and aptly suited for\nthis style of music. He often sails from a pathetic whine to a full on croon. Some times it can- sound leering and contemptuous, at other times frail. Guest\nvocalist Victoria Benjamin adds a pleasantly contrasting tone on several tracks.\nThere are some great songs here,\nbut not enough. D CfC could be a great\nband if they just stopped trying to be so\ndamn grim the whole time. EJ\nTom\nSLY AND ROBBIE\nDrum And Bass Strip To The Bone By Howie B Sly and Robbie - back again.\nApparently, Sly and Robbie have\nreleased a ridiculously large\nnumber of albums over the last\nfew years and apart from their classic\nsingle Fire, all this progress seems to\nhave passed me by. However, prior to the release of their latest offering Strip\nto the Bone, I was eagerly awaiting the tunes to be offered. The reason for this\ncan be guessed from the title, for it was supposed to be a drum and bass remix\nalbum of the duo's work by music man extra ordinaire Howie B. The sound of Strip to the Bone is,\nhowever, far from what I expected to hear. Rather than the scripted drum and bass, Strip to the Bone has a definite\ndub sound to it. Still, this was probably\nthe most likely outcome when it is considered that the album was made In\nJamaica, with Sly and Robbie supplying\ntheir remix chief with, as Howie himself\nput it, 'extra strong weed.' The bass Is\nnot entirely missing but the pace is slow\n- one could say it's perfect for sitting back\nand chilling out with a joint to. No surprises there, then.\nAs for my favourite tracks, the tunes\non the album work to compliment each\nother and as such, track titles are mere\nformalities as the music washes through\nthe atmosphere. The album also turns\nout to be great music to go to sleep to,\n- more proof that this is far from drum and bass.\nSo, all In all, the sound of Strip to the\nBone isn't really Sly and Robbie and it\nisn't really Howie B. But I suppose that's what should be expected when transatlantic music giants with such contrasting\nstyles meet. Not brilliant, but definitely\nworth a listen.

    "content": "22 Clubscene 8 February 1999\nn Specimen A Review + Competition Winners!\nReview: Specimen A@ IC Union\nLast Friday saw the second gig by Specimen A at our union, and what a success\nit was. Their unique brand of aggressive\npunk, and Prodigy-sounding tunes had the 'floor packed out (it had to be really,\nsince it was a sell out).\nBut although IC has seen Specimen A play twice, not many people know who they are. Club scene managed to\nget an interview with them before the gig.\nSo who are they? Well, Specimen A are a couple of likely lads (brothers act u ally) who write, produce and play the\nkind of music that they want to. Pretty\ngood when you take into account that\nthey are only 18 and20 years old. Their debut album, called Pulse, was\nwritten in a year and fuses together several genres of music: hip hop, drum and bass, heavy techno, and trance - a rather\nsimple system of producing tracks that\nthey like the sound of. AI the moment, they are just building up their reputation,\nso by playing a few gigs (a tour is due soon), and a bit of radio play will set\nthem on the road to stardom. Although the comparisons to the Prodigy will be\nmade, the guys are looking to get away\nfrom that type of music - they want to be\nknown for their own brand of \"aggressive\npunk\" and not as rip-offs of Flint et al.\nThis year, they would love to do Glastonbury, or some other festival and perhaps even support someone( Cypress Hill\nwas a name mentioned a few times) on tour, thus building up their profile and getting some much needed publicity.\nAnd with their great live shows, including drummers, guitarists, dancers (their\nroadie!), Specimen A are going for a \"visually active, live sound with plenty of\nvocals and lots of synths\". Ideal for a festival such as Glastonbury.\nThey are also getting lots of support\nfrom family and friends. Their dad has\nbeen on several world tours before( Specimen A did not mention who with\nor what he did), but the experience counts. Their dad also happens to man age them, whilst mum is a music teacher\n(runs in the family?) and helps on the cost ume front. For each show, Specimen A bring a huge amount of equipment, and it's all theirs, so bank loans and all that\nrubbish is really a problem, all they have\nto do is produce the goods. Recently,\nthey signed to the record giants BMG, who will release Pulse and the first single in the next couple of months, sho wing that Specimen A arc a band to be\ntaken seriously.\nObviously this year will be crucial,\nthey need publicity, and they can't afford\nto let the album flop - not that it should,\ngiven the backing of BMG. If everything\ngoes to plan, Specimen A will be around for some time - and we saw them first!\nJohn '00' Fleming Competition Winners\nCongratulations to the following, who correctly answered last week's com pet ion question. Winners will be receiving a copy of John's new mix album in\nthe post very soon: L. Watson\nE. Newsome\nJ. Lewis\nC. Tzineris\nA. Gibson\nMany thanks also to Jodie and Mark at\nPhuture Trax for all their help, and giving\nus CDs to give away.\nGur m Return to the Source\nThe Rocket, Holloway Road, N7.\nSaturdays, \u00a38/\u00a39/\u00a312,\n10pm6 am, capacity -1,200.\nDress code - none.\n\"It's all a load of tree-hugging hippy crap\",\nas Cartman from South Park would say.\nThat is Return to the Source for you. You\nseriously have to be into this sort of thing to enjoy this night. And I wasn't, and probably never have been, even in\nmy more open minded travelling days.\nThat's 'cos (and I 'll be blunt) the music\nwas absolutely shit. Where was the swirling, dreamy, psychedelic trance usually associated with RTFS (just check out\nsome of their albums for this)? That's what RTFS really is about. Or maybe they've moved on to new and s hitter pas-ture s. The only way to desc tl be the music\nin the main arena is as mind numbing. This stuff really made your brain hurt - the\ndance music equivalent of thrash metal.\nTo derive any enjoyment from this, let\nalone being able to dance to it, you would have to have taken enough speed to kill a horse. There was just nothing to\nit - no melody to speak of, nothing to\nlatch on to. Just deafening kick drums and a lot of swaying bodies. I think this\nmusic would have pissed me off even on a paradise beach in Go a. And what makes this even more of a shame is\nthat the venue, The Rocket, is quite good and to be fair to RTFS they did decorate\nit well. I think it's a student union by day,\nso it's a bit angular and functional in\nplaces, but it does the job as a major club\nvenue. The RTTS people are also great.\nVery chilled-out, friendly, happy, and most certainly not scary. But clubbing is\nnot just about these things - it's primarily about the music, and on this fundamental criterion RTTS failed miserably\nlast Saturday. But I'm not going to say\nnever go there, because maybe I caught\nRTTS on a bad night. It was a drumming festival on the night, so every fucker and\nhis wife had a bongo drum on them. And\nI mean even/one. I actually felt quite\nnaked without I should have taken\nmine along with me. Then maybe I'd have got more into it. But I doubt it. You\nsee bongo drums are great when there\nis only a few of them being played by\nhighly skilled performers, as an accompaniment to the music. That's when they\nadd an extra dimension to a club night.\nBut this was bongo drum hell. One room was even wholly dedicated to the little\ncylindrical fell as. Imagine well over a hundred tone-deaf, un talented, and uncoordinated crust ies trying to play (!)\ntheir drums in time with each other.\nObviously they failed, but more importantly they drove anyone foolish enough to stay in the room, completely mad. And what's more they used up a whole room which could have been filled with\nthe hypnotic Goa-tra ncc that RTTS is\nfamous for.\nHowever, don't just take my word for\nall of this. Listen to one of their albums and if you like what you hear then give\nthe club night a go. But remember not\nto take your bongo drum with you. After\nall, clubs arc for dancing in, not for\npounding away incessantly on annoying instruments.\nDog on a String\nRoobarb\n\n"

And a good presenter of course.\nWhat regular features have you got then?\nThere's' Name that Crisp' my fantastic exciting and patented game show with\nstunning prizes to be won. There's also a weather bulletin with Albert Hall. Eh,\nI usually resurrect some clich ed 'guess the link between these three records'\ntype of thing as well. Cutting-edge broadcasting you know.

It's good to have a laugh once in a while.\nAny ambitions for your show?\nYeah I'd like to broadcast it to more than three hung-over students and a cou ple of pigeons one day, just to see how it'd go down. One of the down sides\nof being at IC is the social apathy. I'd love to knowhow it'd feel to broadcast\non Radio 1, knowing that 3 million people are listening to what you're doing.\nAny final messages for the readers of Felix and even the odd 1C Radio listener?\nYeah there's lots of funk in css and social fibre to be found on IC Radio which I think most IC students could do with.

    "content": "8 February 1999 News 3\nRag Pulls Out All The Stops\nRag Week'99 has proved to be one of\nthe most successful in ICU Rag history. A total of nearly \u00a35000 has been raised for\nthis year's charities, thanks to a plethora\nof events which took place over the last\ntwo weeks.\nHaving kicked off with the Sponsored Nude kamikaze Parachute Jump and Variety Show earlier In the week( see Felix 1134), the fund ra is lng really\nmoved into gear with Wednesday's Street\nCollection. In excess of \u00a3800 was collected during the day, thanks to the manic efforts of the Canoe and Mountaineering Clubs. A further \u00a3200 was added to the total via Thursday's hypnotism show, given by former Felix Editor\nturned professional hypnotist Martin Taylor - the highlight of which was when one poor girl was convinced that she had to\nkiss a random man in the audience every\ntime she heard the word \"peanuts\".\nOne of the most successful events,\nhowever, was the field Cup, which took place on Saturday 30 January. Organised by City & Guilds Union, the Cup is basically a pub-crawl around the local area.\nTeams of four slowly worked their way\naround the gruelling thirteen stop\ncourse, winning points for tasks completed in each pub, with bonus points for\nfancy dress, mascots and 'treasure' col-lect ed, fortunately, amidst the large-scale\ncollection of South Ken memorabilia( road signs, traffic cones, police equip ment and C CU mascots), the teams did-n't forget the real reason of Rag - raising\nmoney for charity - and nearly \u00a31000 was\nmade on the day.\nNonetheless, competition for the main prizes was very fierce, with several\nteams haranguing the marshals well\ninto the night. Eventually, however, the\nwinners were announced by C& GU President Reuben Connolly. The 'best\nmascot' prize went to the 'Fridgefella's' who, for bizarre reasons which they\nrefused to make clear, decided to carry\na fridge around for the entire day -even bringing it into the Union bar to\nreceive its prize. The 'best fancy dress'\naward went to 'Drink.Feck.Arse&Girls'\nwho came dressed as the cast of Father\nTed (complete with pet brick and dog-collars). The day's two biggest prizes -the most money raised, and the Cup itself-went to 'Coconuts don't migrate',\nwho raised an Impressive \u00a3166.51 during the day.\nRag Week culminated last Monday with another C&G organised event, the\nSlave Auction. Approximately twenty 'lots' were on offer (mostly Union officers of some sort), selling 24 hours of\ntheir time in return for donations to\ncharity. Although the show started off\nslowly, with the first few slaves being sold for \u00a310 - \u00a320, things hotte dup after ICU Deputy President Marie By David Roberts Ni chola ou was dragged on to the stage,\nto face a stiff bidding war between her\nboyfriend and her football team. The\nfootballers eventually won through, bid-ding \u00a352.50 for Marie to spend her 24\nhours cleaning their boots. Bidding then\ngot into gear, with Felix Editor Ed Sexton,\nC& GUD SO Sanella Hodzic, ICU Accommodation Officer Natasha Newton, and C& GU Treasurer Ian Clifford all going for\nIn excess of \u00a350.\nThe star item, however, was a 'job\nlot' which included ICU President Dave\nHellard, C& GU President Reuben Connolly, Phil Buck man and Matt Tibber. A large group of students formed a consortium and offered in excess of \u00a3200 for\na performance of the Full Monty bringing the grand total raised by the Auction\nup to nearly \u00a3900. On Monday evening,\nthe group duly obliged, and their show was received with a mixture of laughter\nand applause from the assembled audie n ce. Added together, these events have\nproduced a grand total of approximately\n\u00a35000 for the four Rag charities - Shelter,\nImperial Cancer Research, Avert and Trinity Hospice. Although this figure pales in\ncomparison with that raised by other\nuniversities and even the IC Medics, it\nrepresents the first step towards these\nlevels, and more than trebles the amount\nraised last year. A great deal of praise has\nbeen given to Rag Chair Sarah Coburn for\nher efforts in ensuring that Rag Week was\na success, who adds her own note of\nappreciation, \"A big thank you to every-body who took part in, or helped with,\nany rag event\".\nHAIR SALON\nCUT tic.

Until\nWednesday that was when they came across the mighty IC first XI.\nLed by our captain Jamie, playing in odd boots, IC put together a performance that will be talked about for years to\ncome. Regardless of the fact that the keeper, Eric, was urinating in the goal\nand various team members were clearly\nunprepared five mins before kick-off. IC\ncame through with a heroic effort.\nIn the first half Brunei enjoyed some good possession but lacked ideas of few to break down the IC back line of Phil, So-so, chris and Rich.\nIn the second half IC were beginning to\nget a lot more of the ball and came close to taking the lead through Nak and Warren. We finally broke the dead lock, Dave latched on to a loose ball in\nmidfield and exploded through the back\nfour to smash the ball home. Clearly annoyed by this, Brunei started to\nthrow caution to the wind and this gave\nIC an opportunity to break \" ManU td\" style.\nAlex doubled our lead with about 15\nminutes left. Jamie slotted a ball through\nto him and Alex finished it off Spanish\nstyle.\nBrunei, who were now livid with the\nwhole situation, threw forward everything they had but IC were determined not to crumble and held out for a well\ndeserved victory.\nSCOREBOARD\nIC I61 QMW I( ULU CUP)\nWe started off in a sporting ly bad style\ngifting them( with the help of the umpires) an early 1 - 0 lead. This generous habit of giving them the ball regularly continued for the next 20 mins\nuntil 11 + decided to humiliate the opposition keeper by scoring from an obscure\nangle.

Consequently I find myself stranded on the slopes of some Colorado ski resort, but I'm gritting my teeth and making the best of it. I shall not bore you with the details, but\nobviously this column will concentrate on our chums on the wrong side of the pond. Having never been this far\nwest before, a few things have struck\nme. Firstly, you, as I did, may think that\nall this \" Have a nice day\" malarkey is\na tad disingenuous. Not true, they really do mean it.\nMuch as it pains me to admit it,\nthe level of customer service received over here would not be found in\nBlighty. It is almost embarrassing when people move Heaven and Earth to rectify problems for which they are in noway whatsoever responsible. God bless ' em!A trip to the States would not be complete without a perusal of their phenomenal plethora of TV channels. Never in the field of light entertainment has so much been produced by so many for so little so badly. It is\nt tue to say that all the good US tele vision is already over here, and If the remainder offers a vision of our own brave new world of digital television, include me out. Minor niggles aside, it a mighty fine country( had to say\nthat, because a huge blok e has just\nentered the cable car...)\nOf course, as you would imagine, it is impossible to avoid the Impeachment trial. Though its global coverage of news has traditionally been on a par with Exchange& Mart, CNN is\ncovering absolutely nothing but, and consequently it can begin to become a trifle tedious. Rarely are such protracted wars of attrition riveting television, but this\nis setting new standards in tedium, a point which seems to be being acknowledged by\nmany commentators; the nuts and bolts of the Senate trial are so dull, it\nbecomes necessary to talk up any new revelation, however nebulous, to a point of frenzy. By comparison, Mur ray Walker and Peter Snow are models of restraint.\nAt the end of the day, this is hardly\nsurprising, since everyone already knows the outcome. Do you get excited by a by-elect lon in Barnsley or Kensington and Chelsea? Precisely.\nClinton will not be impeached unless111\"... Clinton will not be\nimpeached unless\nsome new revelation\nemerges about him\nengaging in sexual\ncongress with farmyard\nanimals...\"\nsome new revelation emerges about him engaging in sexual congress with farmyard animals( though with the pul chr it udi nous Ms Lewinsky already\nimplicated, it cannot be ruled out completely). The Republicans can dictate\nevery aspect of the trial,\nbecause of their Senate majority,\nthus affording the opportunity to heap the maximum amount of embarrassment on the President. But, when all\nthe mud has\nbeen slung, they will not\nbe able to secure the two-thirds\nmajority necessary to boot him out. They are\nplaying a risky game: the more they attack, the more the American people stand behind their President in an act of amazing loyalty.\nIf that were not dangerous enough, Dan 'Potatoe' Quayle is making noises about seeking the Republican Presidential nomination. The Conservatives have been accused of losing elements of their political savvy,\nbut such unfortunate slips pale into\ninsignificance against what could be one of the most\ndisastrous moves in Western political\nhistory. Despite all\nthis, as long as\nClinton continues to wear the teflon overcoat, both he\nand the Democrats are safe. As for\nCNN, I will be forced to watch QV C at this rate.\netc.), such actions are perfectly legal\nand are carried out in accordance with\nall the relevant guidelines.

Thankfully, fraud is fairly rare at\nImperial: though money is misappropriated on a grand scale ( flowerbeds way employees are handled by\nCollege, it is\na very legitimate question. It has long been said the only way IC would dismiss a member of staff is if they burnt downS her field and massacred the Governing body. Most people at\nImperial,\nwho have been here for a few years,\ncould rattle off a list of people whose continuing employment is source of great mystery. Why should this be?\nClearly, the occupation of positions by incompetent staff does nobody any\nfavours, aside from the individuals themselves. Do we have fearsome ly powerful trade unions? Not really. The cause of the problem is the Personnel division. Though the\ndirector, Marion Kimberly, is highly regarded, this heavily staffed department seems determined to frustrate the activities of\nevery department when dealing with problem employ ees. This often leads\none to suspect that\nImperial is running a charity, providing gainful employment for people the rest of the world would not touch with a barge pole. Quite why anyone would join a trade union here is a mystery: save those union subs and let Personnel people keep you in a job for life.\nThis may seem lo be an irrelevance to students, but we all suffer\nfrom the continued presence of tenth-rate staff. Needless to say, they'll befalling out their pram s in S her field having read what I have just written, saying that it is monstrously unfair of me to decry our hardworking staff in\nthis manner. I should not have to tack\non that most of our staff are good and some are truly outstanding, be they\nacademic or otherwise, but the inevitable hysterical response v in di cates my point. They acknowledge the\nproblem but have no desire to rectify\nthe situation. Now Iam back on this sceptre d isle, I couldn't help noticing the letter\nin last week's felix from' An on'. Normally Ido not bother to comment on letters written by people so gutless to\nattach their name to the views, but I 'll\nmake an exception here. That someone should write a letter about unacceptable staff behaviour just as I have\ntackled the same issue almost implies a put-up job, but I can assure you that\nI didn't write it - I can spell. None of\nus, of course, are always sweetness personified in our dealings with our\nfellow man, but the answer An on received to a perfectly civil response beggars belief. It is astounding that we have such a rude, obstructive person on the payroll, and it is surely only a matter of time before this person really puts his or her foot in it and annoys someone really important; stu-dents, naturally, are the lowest form of\nlife and as such can be treated like\ndirt, or so it says here in the staff manual. While I'm not holding my breath,\nsome previous incidents of staff\nbehaving badly have been investigated by the director responsible after\nthey have been mentioned in this\nhumble column,s owe shall have to\nwait and see.

    "content": "26 Sport 8 February 1999\nAMERICAN FOOTBALL\nNFL SEASON REVIEW 1998-9\nby Chiron Mukherjee\nThe Superbowl, the largest annual sporting event in the world, capped off one of the most exciting seasons of NFL football in recent years. As is so often the case,\nSuperbowl 33, played in Miami, was a disappointing anti-climax. The Denver Broncos, the retaining cham pions and strong favourites, comfortably defeated the surprise NFC Champions, the Atlanta Falcons.\nDenver started the season in tremendous form. They just kept winning and Terrell Davis, the running back, just kept rushing. For most of the season the talk\nwas about whether Denver could match the72 Miami Dolphins as the only teams to win every match of the season. They became only the third team in the history\nof the NFL to go130(13 wins, 0 losses) and a thrilling\nmatch was in anticipation on the penultimate week of the regular season at... Miami. However, in the match before this (the 14th game) Denver surprisingly lost to the New York Giants. They did lose to Miami as well,\nand for a while Denver lost their time in the spotlight.\nBut, they destroyed all opposition in the playoffs, beating the New York Jets in the AFC Championship match,\nand winning their second successive Super bowl. The main factor for their success was the form of Terrell\nDavis. Many believe he could become the greatest running back ever, and he confirmed this by winning the league MVP award (basically Player of the Year). For\nalmost the whole season Davis was in sight of the record for yards rushed in one season (held by Eric Dickerson ). Although he missed this, he did become only\nthe fourth player to rush for 2000 yards in one season( the others are Dickers on,O. J. Simpson and Barry\nSanders (last year)), with an incredible average of five\nDenver QB John Elway shows off the Superbowl trophy\nyards per carry. The other big story relating Denver was their veteran quarterback john Elway, one of the all-time\ngreats. Although he was injured for parts of the season,\nand was not in his best form when fit, his presence as\na talisman was important. His display in the Superbowl\nearned him the MVP award with over 300 yards pass-ing, one thrown touchdown and one personal touchdown. It was felt that he was going to retire at the end of this season (as it appeared last season too) but after\nhis match winning performance, it is increasingly likely\nthat he will\nThe Atlanta Falcons, could not have been a more unlikely choice as Super bowl contenders two seasons\nago, and even this season noone could have predicted their success. This season sounds like a typical\ncorny Hollywood sports movie. A team that has been the joke team in the league since their formation, with\na team full of plucky rejects (Chris 'chandelier' Chandler,\ntheir pro-bowl quarterback has played for 6 NFL teams;\nJamal Anderson, the2 nd best running back in the league was a7 th round draft pick) and underrated professionals defied the odds to beat the San Franciso\n49ers twice. They also beat the Minnesota Vikings, the best team in the league with only one previous defeat,\nin Minnesota, from behind. Their head coach (Dan\nReeves) undergoes a quadruple heart bypass operation after a game and comes back only a few weeks later. Dan Reeves coached the Denver Broncos to\nthree Super bowl defeats in the1980 s, and fired Mike Shanahan( the current Denver coach) for in sub or dina tion, before being sacked himself helped by pressure\nfrom John Elway. The charismatic 'Dirty Birds', as the Falc on s call themselves, looked set to a 'surprise' victory\nin this story. However, the plot took an18 rated twist\nwhen the night before Super Sunday, Eugene 'the\nProphet' Robinson, the Atlanta safety, upstanding family Christian man and the winner of an award for the most moral football player only a few hours earlier, was arrested for soliciting an undercover policewoman for\noral sex (D 'ohl). On the Super bowl, the Falcons per-formed well below their capability and Robinson made the error which gave Denver an 80-yard touchdown that\neffectively sealed the match before half-time.\nFENCING\nGO ON MO, SHOW US YOUR ARSE\nThe saga of the splitting breeches\nOur first match in over two months and a low turnout led to a worrying travel to\nSouthampton. Our sabre and e pee teams only consisted of Mo\"M r Animal\" Manso ori and Rob\" Big Daddy\" Nu er nberg respectively, thus meaning that we would require two non-specialists battling it out in these weapons and a stunning performance in the foil. And they\ndelivered.\nWe started with the sabre, with the opening fight witnessing some of the worst sabre refereeing seen for along time (well done Dave) - fortunately Mr. Animal still won, and went on to win all\nhis fights in his usual fashion! Dave \"Cap'n Fyll\" Hughes and Henry \" Mad Do g\"Mc Morton did well for the foi lists they were both winning two out of three\nfights. Sabre score: IC 7 - 2 South amp ton.\nNext was the foil, with our talents of Dave \"Karaoke APK\" Davidge, along with\nCap'n Fyll and Mad Dog. All in all, they\ndidn't do too badly, utterly destroying\ntheir opposition and not dropping a fight. The only meriting thing was that\nMad Dog didn't even get a point\nawarded against him not bad for No.4 in the country. Foil score: IC 9 - 0\nSouthampton. By this point the match was already\nwon, so we decided that the talents of Mr Animal were NEEDED in the e pee to\nadd to our skill there. He started off fencing against their best e pee is t Frenchboy (close friend of Jailba.it). Frenchboy\nwon( his only fight - Mr. Animal was obviously giving an old international\nteam-mate a chance), but the nMr. Animal was slightly beaten quite by all their\ne pee team. Big Daddy and Cap' n Fyll\nfared much better, winning all their fights\nwith consummate ease. Good show boys. Epee score: IC 6 - 3 Southampton. I hope the ladies will be inspired by this\nglorious ICU victory, and emulate this\nsuccess. Many thanks to Tim for driving\n(we all love you!), Karaoke APK for pro-vi ding the post-match in-flight enter-tain ment, and Mr Animals' breeches for\nholding out for the whole match.\nICUFC 22-5 Southampton OFVA\nRED ROSE\nGORILLAS,\n1\nRDS,\nLY BEARS,\n& MICE\n\n"
