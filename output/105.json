    "content": "FELIX I EW POINT: A WOMAN LOOKS AT I.C.A recent article in Sennet indicated that the\nyoung ladies of Bedford and Westfield on th air own admission worked harder than their counterparts at U.C. and King's. If this, as would seem\nto he the case, is directly related to the ratio\nof men to women in the college, I. C.W. A. theoretically do no work at all. Fortunately this is not\nthe case, and in fact they have to study hard in order to \"keep their end up V against not inconsiderable competition.\nIn the words of a well-known quotation,hove ver,|\" it all depends on what you mean by\" - work. The\nodd jobs they are called upon to do is out of all proportion to their members, and they are, as a rule, very willing to turn their hands to any\nsort of work which the men in their wisdom think\ncould be done better by the ladies. Thay provide\nan active female element in all the clubs which\nrequire a mixed membership (not to mention soma\nthat do not), and in addition run teams for most\nsports, not to mention organising their own exclusive social functions.\nMuch of the social life of the College depends\ntherefore on the support of the women and aach\none has to bear an active part in several different social and athletic societies. Unfortunately, out of the sixty or more members of\nI. C.W. A. only about half do take an active part\nin extra-academic life, and pressure falls even\nmore heavily on the willing shoulders of the\nother half. Surely every ICWArlan realised before\nshe arrived that she would be well in the minority'\nat I.C. and and should have been prepared to take!\na full part in the social life of the College wit b{ out which no university education is complete.\nThis criticism has often been levelled at the men\nas well as the women, but in a college the size\nof I.C. the male contingent can afford to carry\na few passengers, but I. C.W. A. CANNOT and it should be the privilege as well as the duty of\nevery member of I. C.W. A. to take advantage of her\nunique position in the College.\nIn this way the Women's Association could\nbecome a force to be reckoned with in the Union\nwhich would be disproportionate to its size, and\nthose who complain that women'a interests in the\nCollege are neglected would, by their support of\nmeetings and other activities, be instrumental in rectifying this situation.\nIris Dickinson.\nAmarUflHN\nT JAZZ HOP STAG PARTY STOMP\nSo far as I was concerned this function was\na great success, if only because I had the gratification of seeing men being the wallflowers\nfor once i Biased as I am, I can only give a personal\naccount of the evening. I am no connoisseur of\njazz, but I thought the playing of both the I.C. Jazz Band and Bobby Mlckleburgh and his Bobcats\nexcellent. For the men who had to s it out because\nof the lack of girls it seemed no great hardship\nfor them to have to s it and listen, indeed many\nof them seemed to prefer it that way.\nIt was unfortunate that the hop coincided\nwith the combined performance of the Musical\nand Dramatic Societies, and this probably\naccounted for the absence of I. C.W. A. Being\ntheir only representative present, I can\nassure them that it was a function well worth\nattending - if one is prepared to pay the price\nof being a physical wreck fo the next few days.\nR.K. PIPER AT HOP\nA Scottish piper complete with kilt and bottle of whisky turned up at the Rugby Club dance on Saturday having piped on the field at Twickenham du ring the afternoon. When persuaded to play during the Interval he asked the\ndrummer, who had agreed to accompany\nhim, how long the interval was.On\nbeing told he said'/Qood I'll play an\neight some reel that lasts twenty min-ute s.\" Judging by the shrieks and antics of the dancers this novelty was much\nappreciated. ANY SUGGESTIONS?\nOn January 9th. or thir year the first informal dance was held in the Concert Hall by\nthe I.C.U. Entertainments Committee, and since\nthat date a further seven dances have been\nheld there.\nTne hop -re qu enters in the College will have realized that none of these have followed\nthe old style of the \"Bob-hops\" with dancing to\nrecords only. Instead, dancing has alway a been\nto a band, and the price of admission has been\n2/-. Even so the I.C. dances are still an on gst the cheapest in the University.\nAlthough the attendance at the Saturday\nnight hops has increased ire at ly over the past\nfew months, the Entertainments Committee is the\nfirst to realize that there is always plenty of\nroom for improvement. However, without your\nhelp we cannot make these improvements for It\nis upon your criticism and advice that we must\nbase our hop policy. We are here to give you,\nthe members of I.C., the kind of hops that you\nwant, so I am asking you today to put yourself\nin our shoes for five minutes and decide what,\nif any, alterations you would make to the hops.\nWrite your suggestions down on paper and post\nthem to Richard H.T. Garnett through the Union,\nHostel, of the Mines letter rack, R. H.T.C.

Miss Pipe is to be congratulated on her goal scored after a break through na if was down the field. In their last squash match ICWSC\nconvincingly beat Heading University by 4 ties to one.\nATHLETICS On Wed. March 13th.in bright warm\nsunshine, the Athletic Club took part in the opening match of the season,\na four sided match against Guy's Hp tl, L.S.E. and Q.M. C., held at Parliament Hill Track, Hampstead.\nThe team was sadly weakened due to athletes being involved in certain Cup matches, and some had to participate in three events.\nThe first was the 100 yd s. which\nCurtis ran brilliantly to win in10.8 sees., he also won the 220 yd s in23.9, both performances against a moderate breeze and on a lumpy track. Hy slop won the i mile easily in an\nexcellent51.7. However in the middle distances we were dominated by Parrott of Guy's who won the mile from Wall in4 m32s and then shortly afterwards pipped Rayment on the post in the \u00a7\nmile in2 m3 s.I.C. were rather weak in the heavier throwing events but Smith gained2 nd. place in the javelin with142'2\". Hurdle rHys lop was 3 rd. in the high Jump with5'8\" whilst Smith lost the hop step and jump by barely6\" with a jump of42'0. In the sprint relay the I.C. team of Hobson, Hy slop, Bell and Curtis came 2nd. The meeting closed with an exciting tussle in the long jump with John Hobson finally emerging the victor with19'8\"In the total points system I.C. came first followed by Guy's and Q.M. C. who tied for second place. L.S.E. came third. INCIDENTAL RUGBY INTELLIGENCE\nId. Sanderson claims that the Zoology Dept. defeated the Botany Dept. by 6pts to 3, in their annual match in Hyde\nPark. The ref. says the score was 6 pts. all. RIDING CLUB I.G. Riding Club had little success\nIn their annual competition against Bedford and Q.E. C., The Royal Vet. and\nL.S.E. on March 13th. The only rosettes] won were a3rd. in the Fair Class and a1st.in the Musical Sacks, won by\nPaul Mathews.\nThe team consisted of P. Mathews,\nS.Potter, I. Qu az ll bash and D. Bullock, They all had to struggle with varying degrees of success with not very\ncooperative horses. The I.C. team\nwere not last however, being beaten into this position by Bedford College and our congratulations must go to L.S.E. on their well deserved win.\nRUGBY\" REVENGE ON SPRINGBOK S As reported in the late news of last week i Felix, a Sunday XV strengthened by the inclusion of Whitmore and\nMulholland of last year's team, had their revenge on the London Springbok s when\nthey won by 12 pts to3. The forwards\nplayed especially well and in the first half Whitmore scored a try after a fine dribble. A penalty goal for the South\nAfricans equalled the score in the second half. A further try for I.C. after a five yard scrum and a dropped\ngoal by Stone completed the scoring. Their defeat did not restrain the Springbok s activities in the bar after wards and Har ll ngt on responded to African songs and Zulu war cries late into the night. Against Military College of Science on the morning of the International, I.C. won by 3 pts to nil. This was a most undistinguished match and both forwards and backs played in a somewhat lethargic manner, due no doubt\nto the previous night's party. Stone\nlk\u00b1oke da penalty goal in the first half from 35 yd s. Unfortunately no\nreally constructive moves were seen\nfrom either side. The A XV. have preserved the unbeaten\nrecord dating from the advent of S.A.K.. at outside half. A somewhat futile attempt at a drop goal by S.A.K.. against Streatham marred a performance of otherwise selfless football by the A XV\non Sat. March 16th. which they won 9-3.\nWith only one match to play to complete the season before the Cornish Tour the team records are as follows. It can be seen that only one team has\nlost more matches than it has won and\nperhaps the Ex. A have had rather stronger fixtures than a college4 th. team should expect.\np.W.

M.V CAMBORNE.\nThe game which was marred by a strong wind, was fought out at a furious pace\nand the final result was a triumph for the R.S. B. pack. The Sacks although they kicked and handled well on secession s rarely looked capable of breaking through, u amb or ne,w no scored, first, we#i \u00bb-held In their half for most of the game. Their scores, a try and a penalty goal, cb m lng from occasional breakaway s. Fitz pat rlc k kicked two penalty goals for R.S. M. The 6-6 draw means that R.S. M. hold the bottle for another year.\nASSOCIATION FOOTBALL Technology Cup Final. Wed. 13th. March.\nI a a fast open game R.C.S. won the Technology Cup for the third successive year by defeating C&G by 6-1. The goalscorers for R.C.S. were Wank ( 3 )\nPaddle, Co dling and Leach. Hol gate replied for C&G. The Cup and a six aside Tournament Trophy were presented to R.C.S. at the Annual Dinner following the match.\nU.L. Si*>a Side\"Tournament.\nI.C. who entered five teams in the competition were gratified to find four teams reach the last sixteen. However our hopes finally rested on\nthe A team who reached the semifinal only to loose \u00a38 V.C., the eventual w**a \u00abrs of i&m petition. CROSSCOUNTRY In the past few weeks the Club has\nhad rather mixed fortunes, ana once\nmore would have done much better if injuries, exams etc. had not greatly da\u00bbp let \u00bbci our team*.\nOn Wed. March 6th. the 1 st. team beat\nBoro' Rd. College on our course rather more easily than had been expected.\nRain the night before had made th v course muddy and the winning time 1 '\nDave Briggs,29 m3s was about 45sec.. slower than had previously been hoped\nfor. The next week an A team ventured to the wilds of Lincolnshire for a match\nagainst R.A.F. Cranw'ell and Milo cari an sA.C. The fast flat grass course mostly\nover the aerodrome did not suit the team and the result was R.A.F.47 pts I.C.66 pts and M.A.G.72 pts. On Wed. March 13th. the 2nd. team\nwon an exciting close match against Goldsmith's on the latter' s course.\nWith four men for each team home, the scores were equal but then Wronskl\nand( Smith( both I.C.) appeared on the horizon giving us a narrow victory. On the same day, four first team men\ntook part in the gruelling West Ham\nCollege8 mile road race from Stratford to Chi g well. The team came third to L.S.E. and Reading University. Last Saturday another close match\nwas held v. Romford A.C. on their course. I.C. won 27-29 and although our opponents had the first man home\nhe had to set a new course record to do so.\nRIFLE CLUB After one year away a tU.C. the Engineers Cup for intercollegiate shooting,has returned to I.C. The A team defeated Battersea last \u00bbeek. Thus the record for the season becomes:- 8 matches won,\none tied and one lost. This give sI.C.17 points, one higher than U.C. The B team have won all their matches and so finish top of the second division with a comfortable lead over Q.M. C.B team.\nAn innovation this year has been\nthe introduction of an intercollegiate standing and kneeling league, and again I.C. has been successful finishing2 nd to^. M.C. Teams: A. A.H.

We went down the shaft there in a cage to the tunnel, where work was\nbeing done on the brick work and permanent way r and walked about two miles in the tunnel itself, getting sprayed\nen route with wet cement,and,where the roof was being washed,with detergent. Returning to the surface, tea was\nlaid on in the District Engineer's saloon, to the detriment of the carpets. The tour finished with an Inspection of the ancient beam engines\nwhich drive the pumps preventing the tunnel from flooding, With their ten foot stroke, neo Doric steam pipes and\nmahogany-encased cylinders with polished copper hoops( reminiscent of a rather superior sort of beer cask), these engines take one back about a hundred years.

The meeting began with Italian wine\ndrunk to the a xs ccm pani ment of songs of It a lian origin. The programme included the\nshowing of two films, one a historical documentary on the life of a Roman baker, the\nother a travel film with an Italian commentary showing the beauty of the countryside,\nthis was unfortunately marred by the poor\nquality of the print. These were followed\nby an interesting talk by Signer Donini of\nthe Italian Institute of Culture on the\neconomic and political problems of Italyhousing, overpopulation and emigration. A choir of Italian ladies in regional costumes .\nably assisted by Eric Warwicker on the piano,\nthen sang a few gay songs giving the feeling\nof Italian vitality and joy of life.

Green of the Air Squadron, observed this, and\nmoved from centre three quarter to second row forward. Thereafter play became even more scrappy.\nThe play was witnessed by B. Hearn,\nwhose Insolent and destructive critic ism, in the opinion of the writer, of players contending with difficult conditions In aside that had never\nbefore played together, was received with the contempt it deserved.\nPlay then adjourned to the Squadron\nBar.

She prefers men with\na good sense of humour and some intelligence\n(especially if they are tall and good\nlooking).\nShe dislikes 52 buses that hide behind\n75 buses and then whizz past the Albert\nHall, people who don't let her read their\npapers in the Tube during rush hours(or at\nany time), peroxide, and having her feet\nsprayed with water from plastic wash bottles.\nAlthough most of her time is taken\nup with soo i al and athletic activities her\nacademic achievements are quite con-side r able.

Students wishing\nto follow this route are advised to start\nfrom the Institute basement, best approached from the back exit of the tea-bar.\nOnce in the; basement, head in the direction of R.C.S., but take care not to turn\nsharp left, otherwise one will enter a long pul-de-sao, ohara ot eris tio ally terminated by a jumbo-s is e gas meter.\nProceeding southwards under Imperial\nInstitute Road, one arrives under the\nR.C.S. in a maze of steam pipes\nwhere the air temperature is rather high\n(120F). From here one may turn left, and after negotiating a seo on d passage,\no an climb {exhausted into the college\nbasement.

This route may be useful for students b^ red by postal work in the\nvacation.\nThe ventilation machinery is matched\nby a similar contraption at the other end\nof the College. A long tiled tunnel connects the two, and also provides MI escape route from many rooms and laboratories in th<\" R.C.S. basement.\nReturni.-0 to the Institute, mention\nmust be made of the wat ohm an proof\nroute from its basement to the central\ntower, and thence to the rest of this gem of the golden age of Architecture.\nAn indoor track, via the Warburg Institute, permits ascent of one of the\nsmaller towers, from wh i oha good view\nof Imperiania may be obtained, although,\nthis panorama is surpassed by the superb\nview from the top of the Coloutt Tower.\nFrom the Institute basement one is advised to return to the Union at\nground level, owing to the hazards of\nencountering attendants in the Institute\nboiler house, although fellow Miners\nmay minimize travel at this level by a deviation under the Chemical Engineering\nDepartment. Owing to the heat this latter portion is suitable only for thin explorers clad in their oldest clothes.\nFormerly a tunnel led from the Chem \u2022\nEng.boiler house- to the Albert Hall. We\nregret that this is no longer usable on\nChelsea Arts Ball nights, as the tunnel\nis b looked by a wall under the road.\nThis prevented investigation of the \"Un-exploded-bomb-under-the-Albert -Hall-steps\" myth, but Botanists can note a means of returning surreptitiously to\ntheir department by this route.

Interest in these burrows is liable to wane, as for the most part\nthese passageways are only about 2 j ft. high, and tend to become unpleasant as\nthe kitchens are approached. Only\nMooney o an explain this.\nWe have been as je ed to with old information on the route providing an\na oo ess to the Bar during closed hours.\nMany exhibits of interest to the\nprofessional taxidermist exist under\nthe Hideous History Museum.

OCTOBER THIS SESSION, LARGE QUANTITIES OF CROCKERY AND CUTLERY HAVE\nDISAPPEARED FROM THE REFECTORY: 250 LARGE KNIVES, 1L0 SMALL KNIVES, 180 DESSERT SPOONS,\n130 teaspoons, 80 large forks and 570 o ups. Mr.\nHenry, the Seourity Officer, was of the opinion,'\nthat by far the majority of the missing\narticles would be accounted for by people\nborrowing., but forgetting to return them.\nHe suggested that a search in the Hostel\nmight bring to light vast quantities of\nMooney merchandise a3 hap x^e ned when the\nHostel was redecorated last summer. The\nRefectory Committee think that the figures\nare far too high to be accounted for completely inti riis way, and think that new locks\nfitted to the doors will lower the incidence\nof pilfering. Already many of the reserve\nsupply intended for the third floor ref eo tory has had to be used.\nElsewhere around the College petty la rc en cy ha3 been apparent. Favourite haunts\nof thieves seem to be the cloakroom\nand dressing rooms. One person recently\nhast a watch, a wallet, and two pens stolen\nfrom his coat which war. left in the changing rooms whilst he was training) in the Park,\n/mother had his watch taken from the pocket\nof a coat left in a cloakroom during a hop.\nSeveral cases of theft have been known from\nthe squash courts. All suo h thefts should\nbe reported to Mr. Henry.\nMore serious thefts have oc our red about\nthe College of late. Arrests have been\nmade im a number of cases. The culprit who, posing as a Ministry of Works workman,\nstole copper cables from Dr. Latham's laboratory in the Physics Dept., was apprehended; three weeks ago, a thief was\ncaught red-handed stealing lead at the\nback of R.0.S, by Mr-. Henry, who was a i ded by some Ministry of Works workmen.\nIt would help if owners of property\nkept temptation out of the mis doer's way\nby keeping aol oe erm wu ard on there be-longings, keeping t air, under look and key\nwhenever possible- *- rSf teed, it is sometimes\ndifficult to tell whether the property has\nbeen lost or stolen.\nA tribute to the eff i cAen oy of the\nSecurity Officer is the fact that, can-pared with the b size of the College, the\nino&awa oe of larceny is remarkably low.\nDOUBLE BiL TOUCHSTONE WEEKEND\nAt the Touchstone meeting last, weekend the\nguest speaker was Mrs. J. Robinson, reader in economics at the University of Cambridge, and in her opening talk dealt mainly with the predictions)\nmade by Marx regarding- the class straggle. He had\npredicted that as a country developed the smaller\nbusinesses would go out of existence until the\nindustry cf the oo un try would be run by a relatively few combines and wi opel i em. Side by side\nwith this Marx predicted growing misery among the\nworking o lasses and growing conflict between\nemployers and employed until the workers, led By\nthe trade unions revolted and took over the\nindustries after they had been fully developed\nby the capitalists. Although in. many Marx was proved to be o or reo lS The Dramatic and. il usi a al Societies com-he considerably overestimated the intensity of the]\nclass struggle. This in turn, was largely due to\nunderestimating the bargaining power of the trade\nunions and tha mere enlightened attitude of the\nemployers,while also he did not realise that as\ncompanies grow, their ownership would become more\nand more diffuse although their control would lie in the hands of a few.\nA seo on d way In which Marx's had proved\nincorrect was that in those countries where\nCommunism had been adopted, the Industries were\nusually underdeveloped, end it was left to the\nCommunist system to develop the industries rapid lj q at the expense of the workers' standard of livings\nIt had also to be remembered,however, over a much\nlonger period a great deal of misery had been\ncaused in other countries by capitalist develop*\nment.

Soc's production of Mol'\nlore's farce 'Sganarelle' which had previously received second place in U.L.' s One\nAct Play Festival. It was skillfully produced by Miss Barbara Russell. Although\nthe play has not benefited by translation,\nand the plot has its slow moments, the complications are smoothed out by the nurse in the person of Noelane, and all ends happily.\nMr. Terry Wright must be singled out\nfrom a competent cast for his inspired\nportrayal of Sganarelle and Mr. Roger Nesb it t as the valet showed from his performance that he might well become a good\ncharacter actor.\nThe Musical Soo., presented Gilbert\nand Sullivan's 'Trial by Jury' under the\ndirection of their conductor Mr. Frank\nKennard. The orchestra gave an able per-form ance, especially when they had singers\nto back them up, but although the Jurymen\nsang strongly and obviously enjoyed them-selves, some of the subtleties cf Gilbert\nand Sullivan's particular blend of music\nand wit were lost through occasional lack\nof enunciation.\nHowever, Mr. Stafford Dean as the Usher\nsoon brought the audience into touch with\nwhat was happening and the bridesmaids made\na pretty picture dane im their way r race fully round a rather crowded stage.

    "content": "F ELIA LETTERS TO THE EDITOR VIEWS ON VIEWPOINTS\nThis week, FELIX received a viewpoint which\nmany people would consider political in nature.\nFELIX is essentially non-political and non-religious, as is Imperial College Union, and as\na question of policy was thought to be at stake,\nan Editorial Board meeting was called. At the\nBoard meeting it was decided that the columns of\nFELIX should be open to views on anything which\nprimarily concerns students, including views on\npolitical and religious topics - provided that\nFELIX itself did not express an opinion, and\nthat writers' names were published as well.\nEach case, it was thought, if of a political or\nreligious nature, should be considered on its own merits.\nThe particular viewpoint in question, the\nBoard thought, did not have as its basic subject\na topic that primarily commented on student life, and therefore we have not printed it. With the above reservations, controversial\nviewpoints on all topics - even Editorials - are\nalways welcome. FELIX wishes to make it clear,\nhowever, that writers'-views do not necessarily\ncoincide with its own or those of the Union, and\neach writer's name must be published in full. We congratulate Mr. save Briggs of Maths. 1\non being the only person to point out to us last\nweek's \"deliberate mistake. \" What is it? The clue is,' It will cause filing systems no end\nof trouble.' Ho prizes are offered.\n\"Dear S ii What is happening to the I.C. Student?\nSeveral representatives from Industry have\nexpressed grave concern about the type of\nperson who graduates here and claim that the\npresent student has but too narrow an outlook\non life. Who is to blame for this state of affairs?\nI find it very hard to believe that all the\nstudents here are turning into brown bag gers. The fault must lie in the fact that the courses\nhere are far too full and have reached the\nstage of becoming ridiculous. Because a few\npeople t choose to work to the exclusion of\neverything else, it is nonsensical for the staff\nto take their amount of work as a standard for\neveryone else. Indeed most students, are now\nbeing discouraged by the staff from Joining\nany I.C.. Club or Society at all!! What we must have is a cut and dried total\nof work which has to be done in order to obtain\nthe necessary degree marks, but at the same time\nthe student should be allowed sufficient leeway\nin order to broaden his outlook. It has been\nsuggested that the college,particularly the\ndrawing office, should be closed on a Wednesday\nafternoon. This would allow more people to\nparticipate in college activities, but would\ncurb the opportunities of these people who\nreally want to work and gain extra credit.\nIf the present situation is allowed to continue we may as well disband the Unions, turn\nv. he new Union Building into a mass of lecture\nrooms, and rename the College \"The Imperial\nTechnical College\".\nTours etc.\nP. Kal*.\nDear Sir, Tour \"Yiewpoint\" in the last but one\nissue prompts me to beg space to comment. Perhaps first I may be permitted to thank the\nauthor for an unexpected compliment,' if I knew\nthe gentleman I might be tempted to buy him a drink.\nTo a considerable extent Mr. Dixon's observations are valid, although I beg to differ on\na couple of points. In the first place I doubt\nif it i a true that many of I.C.'s individual\nparticipants in U.L. affairs feel they have\nbeen driven away - this certainly did not happen\nto me. Indeed, my connection with U.L. came\nabout through I.C. Soccer Club when it had 5\nregular members of the University XI. (in the\nlast and only cup winning season) and although\nnow I am unable to participate actively in the\nI.C. Club, for a long time J. found a middle\nway of contributing to both.\nSecondly, the assumption that \"the chief\nfunction of U.L.U.i s to organise inter-Col-legia te sport\" is quite wrong. Whilst this may\nbe true to a greater extent for other activities,\non the athletic side the primary concern of\nU.L.U.i s to field teams representing the University, and here the operative principle Is\nthe whole and not part of it l Too few realise\nthat a University is a body of considerable\ninfluence by its very nature, and this is supplemented by practically all of U.L. sport\nbeing senior In status, and some of it inter-national. There is nowhere else where a sportsman can more easily play too way to being under\nthe eyes of Selectors; If only players could\nrealise it and having done so, do something\nabout It( and get a degree) their future is assured. This might well be worth consideration\nat a time when rather more sausages in ident-ical skins are to be turned-out of our South\nKensington factory.\nWe might also ponder upon whether winning,\nwhich is synonymous with success, IS also synonymous with progress, and whether it is really\ntrue that there is a Union and Hostel \"elite\nof untouchables\". Some unfortunate has to be\na Union officer and may want to live in the\nHostel, but few would care to do so if It war*\nwidely accepted that a slur was associated\nwith this status. Why doesn't someone expose\nthe self-made \"mystery\" of tha Hostel Selection\nprocess and scotch the pretenders who feel that\nthey hold the key to an individuals ability to\na ucc e ed or fall with his application? Having\ndone so, then the most active body in the Union\nmight wall be prepared to be lass clandestine In\ntheir effort a to seek a broader University education by participation both at Kensington\nand Bloomsbury, Harlington and Motspur Park.\nTours etc.,\nV.P. Cose\nKEEP OFF THE CRASS\nT.0O P3Kn a BCtT ARCH .\nR.B. Drop for tripping over** V \u2014 PLAH OF BEIT q iT>* l \u00bb\nI ICT. \u00ab\nThe paths have been laid out in tb*\ntrue British spirit of compromise; with\nso many conflicting interest* at heart\nthe designers have provided only one\ndirect route a cro a* the lawn.,\nDear Sir, saving read t ne viewpoint in tha last but on*\nissue, concerning the position of I.C. as a university college, I feel that son* aspects of the\nproblem have been omitted, giving * rather distorted picture.\nCertainly I.C. is one sided, though I believe\nthat a largely technological college produce*\nmore acceptable members of tha community than\na predominantly arte college. Certainly, mora\nwomen at the college would be a good thing,\nboth for I. C.V. A. and the 'sexually starved\nneurotics', as I.C.'s men were described In\n\u2022Felix' by one young lady. Incidentally nobody\nhas yet written a letter refuting this de scrip tion.\nHowever, with over two thousand students,\nImperial Collage, together with two or three\nother colleges in the University, is comparable\nin size with many provincial universities, and\nis big enough to be largely self-contained with\nrespect to University activities. Apart from it a mixed membership U.L. U. Is comparable in many\nways to the union* of the major colleges; and\nI wonder, for example, bow many people in tha\nUniversity knew the name of the U.L. U. President\nbefore the advent of) 'Sennet'.\nThe University of London Is unique, became*\nof its size and the wide separation of many of\nthe colleges, and hence U.L.U.i s also a unique\nInstitution whose fun ct iS ns should be Just those\nwith which the college unions cannot adequately\ndeal. This should include the organisation of\nIntercollege activities catering for minority\ninterests, providing union facilities for tha\nsmaller colleges, and a meeting place\nfor students of different faculties where this\ncannot be achieved in the college concerned, e.g. at I.C. and many of the medical schools.\nRegarding \"the restrictive attitude of tb*\nUnion elite\", I think It is almost inevitable\nthat with so little hostel accommodation, and\nthe existence of th* '22', Links, Chaps, and\nother clubs, a cliquish attitude will exist,\nalthough this in itself is not overmuch to worry\nabout sine* any \"potential leaders\" in the college are unlikely to concern themselves exclusively with such cliques. It is perhaps relevant\nto quote here the words of on* renowned bc ers will er who complained \" if you are one of tb*\nboy* and you get drunk - you're a good chap,\nbut If you're not one of the boys and you've\nhad too much to drink, then you're a drunken\nIdlotl\"\nPerhaps the greatest fault with I.C. is that\nit Is the. *agree that matter* and not tha university education so that there are not enough\npeople who cut. afford to was t*( academically)\ntheir tin* at collage. However I believe that\nanybody who really wants a university education\ncan get it at Imperial Collag*.\nTours etc.,\nF. Peacock.\n\n"
