ROBINSON5 vs. Poii. fortunately, did rot descend\nupon I.C. with tbs> sc s red is as trots effects associated with li is s Zu let ka Bobson at Oxford, li,\nalthough she has brought with her the air of\"' creating chaos cosmic': and inch to our good\nfortune she has stayed considerably longer.\n... \u2022\n' That the-Union office is such' a 'popular\nlurch time parlour is no small reflection on the\npopularity of its friendly queen. Those who\nare still' finding their way in I. C7 are assured\nof one good friend and adviser in the guise of J*s. Rob. That she is a familiar and welcome\nfigure in our midst is not surprising, for she\nhas that rare quality of being interested in people. She likes all pe c ple, and she asks for nothing more than to learn what is happening in the world; in your world, the college world, or the world at large. Gleened from the University Staff in1950 bar former career included a somewhat in congr u \u2014 s convent education( one recalls in r ned late lySs arle's Horrible Schoolgirl at St. Tr in ian' s), and a period in an engineering office( from which\nshe has amazed Be re k Crossley with her knowledge\nof car radiators). At sane time during this period she married a nebulous architect who frequents the War Office ere after termed ' The Rob'\ntis known that she can type and, when nee-d vs ary, is fan ji liar with her own brand of short hand\" She appreciates the importance of \u201e a task and when required! will work with great gusto and\naccuracy until it is can ple ted, However, she ,\nlikes to gossip, but will hear no ill, and like h$r sex finds that time is meaningless.\nTHE UNION ORACLE\nExisting pri rf lr ilyin the orbit of Union\nOfficers her fond love of lesser mortals produces\nan annual desire to transform these reputed\noligarchs into just normal beings. (We all wish\nher every success). Nevertheless, she admires\nan honesty of design, and! purpose both in a meta-; b orl cal and literal sense, and. is ready to understand, and help any realistic effort whether\nit is to improve or amuse. One associates with Mrs. Rob. a rich quality of warmth of colour and\none fee IS* that whilst she is with us the college is certain to retain an atmosphere of humour toil\nfriendliness., A She bas a ready wit and charm\nwhich has disarmed the most retiring' Fresher' and it has been said that she even called Nicholas an 'Old: Fool1 toMs face and yet they\nstill rer a infirm friends. \u2022 Enjoying a sense of the absurd and. ridiculous she, feels equally at home either in an old car several of which\nfrequent th fe.

Interior t\\,i^b.' Any-.* *\n> ij f of topics which appear endless and with which she has captured the college.( Already one member\nof the college has calculated the number of hours of Mrs. Rob's time to which he was entitled and insisted on b is rights. A procedure that is understandable but not recommended. We wonder\nhow ' The Rob' views these computations1) Mrs. Rob is a welcome figure in the Union and may we wish her many more enjoyable years a tI.C. She has many a friend who will be\"coming alongside.' P.S. If anybody has a spare carboy or demijohn would they please contact Mrs. Rob. BRIGHTON RUN-1952\n\\ -On Sunday last \"iSo\" had his annual outing to the seaside when, with133 other pre L to i cars, he took part in the London to Brighton run. The crew and distinguished passengers, The President and. Secretary of Guilds, assembled at the unheard of hour of7.0 a.m., well provided\nwith tr aek into she s, ground sheets and umbrellas - as is the\ncustom for the Brighton Run. Spirits were low since on\nhis outing on the. day before, \"So\" had been producing a fantastic assortment of bangs and. rattles, from somewhere in bis.;ln n6U 'ds, but was supported by two tender cars in case\nof accident. When a few, yards from the starting position in Hyde Park the engine stalled and to everybody's consternation it was discovered that the pin on the starting shaft had si eared.>. fess rs. Allsopp' and Aspinall were dispatched\nhack, to Guilds in search of another, returning same thirty minutes later, laden with every piece of suitable material that the workshops1' could produce. They were just in. time\nto clamber aboard, the President doing aspect e cul 'ar canter down the course to the amusement of the crowd.\n\\ Once under way \"Bo\" went magnificently and reached\nBrighton non-stop. \"Brt\" started at nut t ber forty seven but thanks to some \" dice j;\" driving by Mike Bay, was the third,\ncar to cross the line. The only mishap was when Edmund\nHarding received a, gallon of petrol in his face. As this lr vas in at in and doing about 20^m,p.h he came off the\nworse. '\nThe car was met by the Lady Mayor of Brighton, who\npresented the pennant, and by a B,BC. man who proffered a mike for the views of the crew. After lunch\" Bo* took_ a father ignominious part in the procession of veterans, the\nrest of the procession getting so far ahead that it was lost altogether. \"Bo\" made it all the way back home under his own power\ndespite the rain, having added another Brighton Run medal tol\nalong list of successes.\nlate Mem\nGUILDS won the SCBPHY and LOBBY\nIn both the MINES were second. There was a clash early ito the Lowry. BLOOD TR AS Fim ON FOR STUDENT SOCIETIES Our last' Viewpoint' suggested that the. Lunchtime Lectures and the longer hours on Tuesdays and Thursdays are seriously hampering the activities of Student Societies. This matter was s is cussed by the General Studies Committee last week.\nThe programme has been mapped out too far ahead to allow the Lunchtime Lectures to be transferred to Mondays and Fridays this Session, but the Comm.iti ee hoped that Student Societies will the msl eves organise lunchtime functions on Tuesdays and Thursdays as part of the General Studies scheme.\nSuch functions are to be announced on the printed posters advertising the General Studies and Mr. Mc Do wall has offered to assist the Secretaries of Societies interested to get outside speakers to take part in midday debates and discussions. Next term's General Studies programme will be devoted principally to International Affairs and Literature. It is hoped to include also two\nfilms and a full Union Debate. DEBATING TRIALS *U(( \u00a3*S This was an ambitious experiment, considering the general lack of interest in college debating, but results proved quite encouraging. The trial, held last Thursday was organised with an eye to picking a debating team to compete in the' varsity championships', and. also to discover and encourage any potential talent for speaking in future college Debates. The speeches were judged according to imagination and breadth of outlook, logical development, am eloquence and presentation. The main impression of the Judges, Mess rs. Sobey,\nWear ne& Ruhemann, was that although the general standard of speaking was quite high, little at tamp t was shown by speakers in developing the ideas presented. A full scale debating trial is to beheld on Friday,14 th November, at5.30 p.m. in the Botany Lecture Theatre, conducted on similar lines to the University championships. The subject for debate is to be announced at5.10 p.m., giving the teams only20 minutes to get some ideas before the start. It is to be hoped that plenty of support will be forthcoming for this venture to put I.C. Debating on the map.\nFinally, it is hinted that an Annual Debating prize is tp be made to the most improved debates of the year. CHANTICLEER\nIn Stroud, would wind instruments are aloud; B'ass, on the other hand, is band. "

    "content": "FELIX sHE\" UMG NrT Poor old Shaw'. Hardly dead and the world hits back. Not that you can blame it, for20 years of exposure, ridicule and debunking would provoke even humanity to retaliation though they didn' td are do it while he was alive. Even our library has entered into the universal conspiracy; we have a mere handful of his lesser works( apart from those abominable complete editions which are too heavy to carry away) .\nHe was always a Joker. All his obit u aris ts pointed out his complete lack of seriousness. Read\" Kr s. Warren's Profession\" and\" Kaj or Barbara',\nand have a good belly laugh. Try Wilde and Pi nero as well, the pinnacles of divorce court comedy and airy nothingness. After these playboys it will be a relief to move over to Ibsen, to dodge as he flings an a gon is ed ideal at you, and to shudder as it bursts into pieces. When\nhe' s stripped you naked of illusions you can pick up Piran dello and get dressed again, rather self consciously, or collapse in the arms of Coward\nand wallow in sophisticated nostalgia, rather artificially, or even meta physic is e with Priestley, rather Samar it yr anic ally. Returning to the Irish, who have just celebrated their Golden Age, Synge and0' Casey are represented, but not Yeats. How odd it is to compare the wonderful flood of genius from their poverty stricken land with the contribution to Drama made by stupendous, colossal, Philistine U.S.A., whose Eliot s and Is her woods are English, and whose\nO'Ne ill is surely of Irish descent. Wandering a little further, I was just stout to vitriol is e on the absence of the Great Ghoua of Russian Tragedy when I noticed that he was stacked under T, not C. This, of course, explains why\nhes only been taken out4 times in3 years, since no lover of literature would look for a man of letters under Teh( or for any true artist at all for that matter). Still, the vitriol need nt be wasted. I discovered that Turgenev, St rind berg and surprisingly, Maugham are absent from our Drama shelves At, any rate, if you read plays at all you' ll be very much in the fashion. Seated in the tube the other day I was compressed between Euripides and A Woman of No Importance. A man opposite was silently mouthing his lines from\" The Holly and the Ivy\". It was rather overpowering. Plays are overpowering: they convey more condensed ideas than novels: the best of them are in the vanguard of political and cultural advance. in conclusion, Ibsen again. Hes still a thousand years ahead of society. which is, as usual, five hundred years behind itself. MINES FRESHER S DINNER The Mines Dinner officially began at7.30 p.m. on Friday, October the31 st, but long before that hour fresher s and old hands a like could be seen in the bar partaking of the liquor of life. Having thus fortified themselves against an evening of speeches, the whole assembly drifted or dragged themselves upstairs to the Dinner. The Dinner itself was magnificent, and the presence of a source of free C2H5O H was fully appreciated by all and sundry. When everybody had been satisfied both alcoholic ally and gast rano mic ally, the President, Bill Robinson rose and\nafter having said a few well chosen words about the R.C. Sand its president, introduced the evenings speeches. These were made by the Dean, Professor David Williams, the VicePresident Geoff Cox, and a Fresher Bot. Kingdom. All of the speeches were witty and entertaining in content, bu,t one\nor two shaggy dogs ( big ones too.'!) managed to shuffle their way in. The President then suggested that the gathering should retire to the bar, the expressed purpose being to initiate the Fresher s into the drinking of the\" yard\". SOCIAL. FRIDAY,14 TH NOVEMBER.

    "content": "FELIX\nLETTERS TO THE EDITOR\nSir, Jt is my view that even the diehards among the college\nare at last reconciled to the view that democracy is dead\nDisturbing as is this remark,let us make a post mortem of\nthe last Union meeting to draw the attention of the main\ncollegiate body to the appalling conduct of affairs. First\nly the annual irritation that is November the fifth is over\nand the President of the Union has achieved his object in\nminim ising the chances of arrest of the rebel few. As such\nhe is to be congratulated but in his method he has earned\nthe session al resentment of the vast bulk of the students.\nNovember 5th is an odious affair for any President to have\nto handle, but, is it too much to expect that the majority\n\u2022student opinion will be heard on future occasions? OrGvif/il\neach President take it upon himself to present the College\nwith a fait ac comp lia brief week before the event? These\nat any rate.are matters that will concern those who stay\nand suffer in the s uc ceding years.\nBut to more pregnant matters, those which will affect\nthe .economy of students lasting the present session. In\nthe first place I am appalled at the profit that the book-stall makes, Not that I consider $1800 a good trading\nreturn. My personal view is that with competent foresight-ed organisation .this profit could be doubled by attracting\nto the books tall those customers like myself who recognize\nthat nearly every commodity sold that can be bought elsewhere is either at or above, a par price. Also a great\nva rie ry of commodities that are really useful are not a vai able, showing either inadequate stocking or just sheer bad\nbusiness in sell i% only what y q w want to sell and not what\nthe customer wants. To be specifics is the present admin-is t ration, adequate or does the books tall committee need\ncloser liaison with the main student body?\nThan there is that heartbreaking queue at lunchtime in\nline for the expensive lunch. I 'say expensive bearing in\nmind jr that c if I feed downstairs that I shall have to undertake a20 minute walk to get a better one at the price.\nBut last session I would never have thought of going elsewhere for lunch (human inertia and all that). Now alas I have taken root in my room during the morning and am reluctant to appear in college until p.m. Pity the poor undergraduate with his timetable and the prospect of a30% increased price to pay for his % hou i queued-meal! Does the\nUnion, which has taken upon itself to fall into line with\nthe government policy of economic restraint no matter what\nthe consequences, still claim that it has the best interests\nof the college at heart? What about making the lot of the\nstudents easier by a workmanlike policy towards the re fig cr tory such as a i2000 subsidy per year? Or has that got f* the brass hats screaming?\nFinally I think that it is as well to air views in Felix before they are brought to the next Union meeting.\nYours etc, Mm So \u00a3 ) ey8 ih.November, 1952\nDear Sir\nTh\n\" A i other A it arctic Explorer he articles in Illustrated referred to in today's of Felx have a far greater connection with I.C. than you imagined - such is the dulling effect of time.\nThe member of the expedition m ho took the magnificent\nphotographs which appeared in Illustrated\" is an old Guilds\nman.^and he it was who went down the crevasse and rescued\nAlec Trendall. . \u2022 , \u2022 ,\n\\ Kevin Walton who was a Civil' from 1936-39 joined the\nNalry on leaving college, and was later awarded the D.S.C.

The four double decker s and an extra couple of coaches were soon filled, leaving atleast150 people on the pavement. These had to wait until the first' buses could come back, and so .hist at the\ntime where I.C. should have been clear parties C\" fall types, juvenile and delinquent, were already collecting around the Albert Hall and making*,\nmerry and they were persuaded to keep in the Union, away from constabulary criticism.

Once again, there were great delays as the\nwhole plan of return had to be worked out to get in the extra journeys. A further two coaches\ncalled in, and the last two J bus loads arrived at Kensington at one o\" clock. The preparations a tH arlington by the Rugger,\nSoccer and Hockey Clubs, and their Hosie rsa tI.C. were very good, and the Entertainments Ccmtrittee\nmanaged to fix up their record equipment satisfactorily for the Hop. It was a pity th a there\nwas no arrangement made by which the support fa*\nthis event could have been gauged. As it was\nthe organisers did well in ordering more transport than the Union mee'tih g suggested. If they had\nnot, there might have been a spontaneous riot and\nrag a tI.C. after all.

Although Guy Fawkes\nDay arrangements were on its agenda, the roost important business to be taken were the Union Accounts, and it was the\npostponement of these that caused the Union to meet as late as October31 st.. As a result it rushed through its... annual opT\u00bbrta jn it y^ examine the fir fin ces or the Union the A Th let lP and gro ix id Committees, and other College organisations. The\nBooks tall profit was passed, though the meeting was surprised with the information that the Union does not face the Refectories' losses. The Meeting earlier elected four members, from six candidates, to fill the depleted Entertain n ents Committee.\nThe award of the Links Club Memorial trophy was made to the Rugger Club, holders of the University Championship.\nThis Prize is* awake de ac}~ year, on the nami nature of the A.C.C. j to the most improved athletic club of the college. Then came the Presidents' announcements of the arrangements made for a Bonfire Hop and Display a tH arlington. This was at first received in silence, but then opposition laW in ff oW a^o PoM m to^ tfg ry St ne> Rag mood; and that an official share should be taken in a meeting more suitable the other colleges' procession in London. The tone of these speakers was against any energy being spent a tH arlington, and a vote was soon taken to keep the\nUnion open so that Rag parties could assemble. Following this it was very nearly proposed that the H arlington Hop te\ns topped, a suggestion being made that only one bus be ordered instead of the five planned. This mood was damped by two good speakers from the Government's apparent minority, and the meeting withdrew its motion already passed, and substituted in Its place one giving the\nDuty officer what he already posses ed^o wer to close the Union a this discretion. Time then forced the closing of the meeting in Sullen humor, with the Vacation Work Scheme and Any Other Business not even discussed. U. LU. PRESS CONFERENCE\nOn November 3 rd the President of U.L. U.( Mr. Alan Tate) held a press conference attended by representatives of all tie\ncollege newspapers and magazines. The purpose of the meeting Was to describe the current programme of the Union and ft s~ societies so that it would receive greater publicity. In the absence of a University newspaper-wh i eh the President said would not be restarted until1 its financial success was assured the college papers had to cover University as well as local college affair. No firm proposals were made but as a result of the meeting the University Union on the one hand\nis be bi ming to act as central agency for such things as advertising and block making and on the other hand the college newspapers are likely to give rather more publicity t oU.L.U. and U. L.A.U. affairs. THE INCA OF PERUSALEM\nand the\nJEALOUS WIFE\n- with Dramatic Apologies\nThe title of the I.C. contribution to the\nL.U.D.

Less understandable was the printing of the\nwrong dates for the Dramatic Society Christmas production a tI.C. We say that their original notice misled us: they challenge our soda lit yIn any case the correct production dates are the\nfour nights, Wednesday 1 0 th to Saturday13 th of December\n\n"

WEARNE CIRCULATION: 1250\nWe have received several letters from people who are concerned about the rag situation. They express the point of view which seemed widely held at the Union meeting last week.\nRags can be divided into two types. There are those which are the result of spontaneous outbursts on the part of a few students: these have no connex ion with the Union, and\nit would seem to be no concern of the college if individuals on these occasions disgrace themselves in the eyes of the public. If the name of I. C.enters it is purely incidental, such as would happen if one of our mountaineers was killed, or if one of us won a NobelPrize for literature. We fe ol that in eruptions of this kind, it is hard on the Union Officers that they should feel bound to warn us of hellfire and\nexcommunication. The second type, organized Union sponsored Rags, are much more respectable; but we have seen little of them a tI.C. They most, from their very3 ize, be law abiding. It is right, we feel, that in these circumstances our authorities should clamp down on ir responsibilities committed in the name of the college. It is this second type of rag with which we are concerned; the other has nothing to do, Cff ici ally, with the Union. In the coronation year we will have plenty of scope\nfor organizing charity processions and carnivals. They will need careful planning; they will need to be nurtured in an atmosphere of good will from the top. Above all they will need to be controlled by a responsible and enthusiastic body of students. Further views are welcomed.\n0 C3175A baby Austin that arrives halfway up the Albert Hall steps one morning, is potentially in a very funny state; especially when it is one of the original models, and is named' Belinda' on the bonnet. So when this occurred a fortnight ago, we were all amused at lunchtime to see it there; but though the motives of those who put it up there were personal, and their business, we feel that the damaging manhandling they gave it, calls for criticism. Unnecessary hardship was inflicted on the owners by lifting it by the wings and other light parts. The care taken by the ten gentlemen that brought it down was a lesson by contrast. DIARY\nLast Saturday FELIX and PHOENIX went to a Journalists Nat ter and Hop at Kings College. They were received sympathetically, softened up with alcohol, and then got to business. A little careful diplomacy on our part obtained a promise that regular copies of\" Kings News\" and \"ft\"' would be sent to us.V ARI TYPES'\nAs an experiment for us and our printers to try out the VAEI-TYF5R\nprocess, some pages of this issue of FELIX have been\ncomposed on VAPI - TYFHR. Until the results of trials\nhave been examined, we d aren't say more about the future\nform of FELIX\nThis issue is the last under the care of Stephen Wearne,\nwho has been temporarily Editor this term for a second time. The next will be in the hands of A.R.B ray. FELIX congratulates the following members of Chem. Tech. on\ntheir marriages: D. G. Cowan, to Cynthia Brown, T.J. Gilbert, to Peggy Petit pierre, D.V.

EXHIBITION ROAD. LONDON, S.W.7 OPPOSITE SOUTH KENSINGTON STATION\nTEL. KEN 8 9 4 7\nYifiwpointD INNER IN HALL Dinner in Hall on Tuesday nights has this term been experimentally moved from the Upper Dining Hall to Ayrton Hall. This transfer, initially for a period of three weeks, has now been extended to three months; but since the first trial is now\nover the time has come to consider what conclusions may be drawn from it. In the first place, as might be expected, the change has produced no noticeable effect on the number of people attending Hall Dinner, though in the opinion of some, the quality of food is not now\nquite so high as formerly. The primary issue is one of convenience and comfort, and consequently In the last resort, a matter of taste, as to whether Ayrton Hall is to be preferred to the Union. Now\nwe have it on the authority of a Latin author that in matters of taste there is no use disputing, and to say that I would rather dine in the dark intimate warmth of the Upper Dining Hall than in the cold pastel spaces of the Ayrton Refectory, is to be\npurely personal and subjective. But there area number of points pretty universally agreed which must be considered in this connex ionas well. For instance, if more than about50 people decide to dine in on any Tuesday,( and70 and80 are numbers not unknown) then the Dinner will have to occupy, not the alcove at the end, but the main Ayrton Refectory. And whereas, say60 people in the alcove at the end would bean almost in sani tory density, a mere60 in Ayrton Hall itself would constitute an unstable aggregate from which a depressing spiritual evaporation round the margins would occur. A hundred atleast is the critical mass needed to make Ayrton Hall psychically comfortable. The Senior Common Room in the Unwin Build in ef' is vastly more pleasant than that in the Union, particularly for an intimate or serious talk round a fire. And when it is crowded the UnionS. C.R. can at times resemble anT To garth ian taproom. But for the average Dinner in Hall it sewed very well, and for the x average Dinner in Hall the Unwin S. C.R.isto o large. Over sherry and coffee the diners, divided fr or a one another in what are virtually three rooms, find themselves again below critical mass, and split up into fixed and intent little groups into what a more question begging view pointer might have described as' cliques'. In sum, until Dinner e in Hall are habitually attended by a hundred, or more, I should prefer them to beheld in the Union building and if many agree they are less likely to reach their century while they are held in Ayrton Hall. URSA MINOR FELIX GATE CRASHES: OVERSEAS STUDENTS RECEPTION I.C. overseas students assembled in the Old Lounge on\nFriday(7 th.) evening on an invitation from the Overseas\nStudents' Subcommittee of the Union. Mike Neale, the commit-tee chairman, opened the proceedings and introduced the speakers. Prof. Read, the Pro Rector, first welcomed the students to the college, and recommended them to get to know\nthe country while they were here. He was followed by Mi3s Mary T revel yan, the University Adviser to Overseas Students, who gave a few practical tips to the newcomers; including that her office in Gordon Square was always ready to help them. John Harding, the R.C.S. President, de put ising for Ron\nMac fie, recommended in particular Touchstone and Dinner in Hall as two excellent ways of mixing with people, as a start, so that when the overseas student goes back home he should be able to say that he had been ' of I.C., not ju st*at*I.C. Frank Slinger land, the Secretary of the Committee, a Canadian himself just getting used to kippers and the left handed fork, warned the new students of the early tendency to mix only with ones own countrymen.\nThen the meeting went up to the buffets up o er. Here the various Clubs were represented by Captains and Presidents, though there was none of the flourishing advertising of Fresher s Day. Small groups were seen discussing all kinds of subjects( Your reporter recalls Drama, atomic physics, Mau Mau,4 Dutch Geology under examination) It was indeed a welcome function for the overseas fresher who had felt' left0\" t' for the first few days. NEWS IN BRIEF\nTelevision News ree i visited the Hydraulics Laboratorytwo weeks ago to film a flood gauging. model for the West Lyn\nRiver being tested by M r.P.O. Wolf for the Consultant Engineer. The few minutes film is reported to have been technically quite interesting, but the amount shown in the Vision broadcasts later that week ran only a few seconds. The work\nwas also mentioned in the Radio Be ws reel. The \"Low Temperature\" section of Chem. Tech. have\nrecently been on a five day trip to Holland; where they visited the Kamer leigh Ornes Laboratory, Leiden, the Dutch State Mines, and Philips, Eindhoven The new Secretary of the Entertainments Committee is I.W.
