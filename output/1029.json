    "content": "News\nAGM Angst and Antics\nBY THE NEWS TEAM The success of today's Annual\nGeneral Meeting( AGM) of\nImperial College Union, which\nwill be held this lunchtime in the\nEnts Lounge, is in doubt.\nA candidate for one of the\nUnion posts has forged a second er's signature. FELIX has\nlearnt that the supposed second er has not even heard of the proposed candidate. The impersonated engineering student has\nsuggested that the candidate\nmust have been \"smoking too\nmuch dope, maybe off his head.\"\nHe further added that this sort of\nactivity \"makes a mockery of the\nwhole election.\"\nRACHEL WALTERS Sir Ronald Oxburgh, Rector of\nImperial College, has predicted\nthat IC will soon be forced to\ncharge undergraduates.\nSpeaking at a lecture last\nMonday on the role of Imperial\nin the future of Higher Education, the Rector refused to\ngive an exact time-scale, but\nsuggested that top-up fees could\nbe introduced by the turn of the\ncentury. \"It will not be in the\nimmediate future, and we will\nnot be alone,\" he said. As a member of the Russell Group of\ntop universities, which includes\nOxford, Cambridge and the LSE, Sir Ronald is believed to have\npreviously considered the introduction of top-up fees to boost\ntheir falling budgets.\nHe emphasised the importance of College developing a more flexible approach to\nteaching, as well as finding a way\nto be more economical. High lighting the need for the College\nto vigorously defend its approach\nto undergraduate teaching, he\nsaid that \" if we plan without\nrecognising that our position in\nthe world has changed, we could\nmake some very bad decisions.\"\nSir Ronald expressed\nconcern that the older, elite\nuniversities, will lose out in the\nIt is not clear whether in fact\nthe nominee is a 'joke candidate',\nas by Wednesday night he had\nonly managed to find four\nsecond ers. The validity of the\nwhole meeting is being questioned as two hundred people are\nneeded for the AGM elections to\nbe legitimate.\nThe meeting, which is\nscheduled for today at 1pm in the\nUnion Lounge, has further\nsuffered from a lack of publicity.\nLast week's advertisement in\nFELIX gave neither a date nor a time and posters did not appear\naround college until yesterday\nmorning. This has been contrasted with the wide publicity\ngiven by the Union to encourage\n'dramatic changes' which are\nhappening to higher education.\nHe was critical of much of the\npresent university environment,\ndescribing the highly influential\nHigher Education Funding Council for England as being 'at\ntimes hostile and threatening'.\nThe Committee of Vice\nChancellors and Principles\n( CVC P), which attempts to\nrepresent all higher education\nheads, had 'shifted away from the\nkind of things we do and the\nkind of values we cherish'.\nThe wide ranging talk\ndiscussed the changing relationships between teaching, research\nand industry in the light of the\nstudents to vote in the recent\nNUS referendum.\nToday's gathering is to elect\neight new Union officers and to\nratify the election of next year's sabbaticals. In addition, this\nyear's officers are likely to be\nquestioned over their annual\nreports.\nThe only contest in the\nelections is likely to be that for\nthe powerful job of Council Chair. As FELIX went to press\nthe only declared candidate was\nVinnie Fernandez, Royal School\nof Mines Union President, but\nsources insist that Charlie Bell,\nRoyal College of Science Union\nPresident, had previously\nplanned to stand.\nxu ca3bo recent expansion in student\nnumbers. He was particularly\nenthusiastic about the idea of\ncontinuing education. This would encourage graduates to\nreturn to university during their\nworking careers for retraining\nincreasing interaction between\nhigher education and industry.\nThe Rector highlighted the\nstriking changes seen in the level\nof student finance, showing\nfigures which indicate that by the\nend of the century funding per\nstudent will have halved from\n1980 levels. Sir Ronald is\nbelieved to personally prefer the\noption of graduate tax over top-up fees.\n(ICP continues from page one)\nthe Asia Pacific region.\" World\nScientific Publishing is the only\nsizeable publishing group based\nin that area of the world.\nICP's Editorial Advisory\nBoard is chaired by Lord George\nPorter, Nobel Laureate and\nProfessor at Imperial College's Department of Chemistry. It is\nsuggested that they will approach past students and\nacademics first, but will also look\nto publish works from outside\nthe College. World Scientific\nwill lend sales, marking and\ndistribution skills, as well as\nactually producing the books and\njournals.\nSpeaking to FELIX, Tony\nMoore of ICP suggested that the\nextra impetus to launch a publishing concern might be due\nto Imperial's emerging status as\na medical institution. It is\nthought that Imperial College\nPress will publish extensively in\nthis field, as well as in science\nand technology.\nMr Moore stressed the\nimportance the emergence of\nelectronic formats, saying: \"it is\nrecognised that is the way\nscience publishing will move - it\nis a matter of sooner or later.\"\nLoweth\nto Go\nBY THE NEWS TEAM The main Imperial College\nrepair and maintenance contra c tors, Loweth and Company, look\nset to lose their IC work. Their\nagreement comes up for review\nthis July. Last year the company\nwas reappointed after an annual\nassessment, but with their\nquality of work being quest io ned, the contract is once again\ngoing out to tender.\nRon Jeeves, College's Operations Manager, has said\nthat it is 'likely that we will not\nemploy them' after the current\ntendering procedure. While emphasising that the re-tendering is 'part of the natural\nprocess' he later admitted that 'it\nis almost certain' that another\ncompany will take over the\ncontract.\nRector Talks Top-up Fees\n002 FELIX I9fl)fl r95 "

He became the youngest person\never to accomplish this feat.\nHe achieved the fastest flight ever in this\ncountry over a distance of 500km in both the\n15-metre and standard classes. The flight was\nfrom Lasham (near Basingstoke) to Tickhill\n(near Doncaster) and back again. He did this\nin a time of around 5 V2 hours at a speed of\n85kph beating the previous record of 75kph which stood for the past 5 years.\nThe glider was purchased thanks to\nmoney from the Union and the Harlington\nTrust. The ASW-24 single seater glider was\nrecently on show on the Queen's Lawn during which time the Rector came and\nwished the club every success for the future.\nThe total number of glider pilots who\nhave flown 500km is very low as a flight of\nthis length is only possible on a couple of\ndays each year. Pete's background in gliding\ncommenced when he was 16 as a Lasham\ncadet and he has recently been awarded an air\nleague flying scholarship to enable him to\ngain his PPL. He joins Afandi Darlington\n(Aero 4) as only the second ICGC student to\nhave ever flown 500km.

    "content": "A Fast, Floppy\nCheck Mate\nhis home computer. Last year one of his programmes, Genius 2 beat\nFor hundreds of years the game of\nchess has been thought of as one\nof the defining marks of human\nintelligence. Its grandmasters\nmay not have been viewed as very\nuseful by the general public, but\nin some abstract sense we were\nalways glad they existed. Now however, the shadow of the\ncomputer looms large over the\nworld of chess.\nOn one level sit the big\nnumber crunching mainframes,\nwith names like Deep Thought\nand Deep Blue; these are the\ndedicated chess machines which\nplay the 'full' game. Scurrying\nbelow such behemoths are the\nmicro-computer based pro-gram mes; the rapidly developing\nkings of'speed chess'. Perhaps the\nmost famous of these are the Chess\nGenius series of Richard Lang.\nIn a similar way to many of\nof those who have since come to\nprominence in the computing\nfield, Richard just started off\nmessing around at home. He also\nstudied Physics at Imperial. \"I worked a bit too hard and didn't play hard enough\" he joked when\nI spoke to him over the phone\nfrom his home on Dorset. After\ngraduating in1977, he got his\nfirst job doing safety research for\nBritish Gas.\n\"It was about the same time\nthat I got a home micro and just\nplayed around with it, as a hobby\", Richard explained. At first he toyed with simple\nprogrammes for noughts and\ncrosses and the odd video game,\nbut 'the first proper game pro-gram me' he wrote was a chess\nplaying programme. \"I started off\nplaying chess at school\", he said\n\"and I did play at the college club,\nbut only for a term\". This hobby\ngrew until one of this programmes won a European microcomputer chess competition.\nAfter that he was offered a job\nwith a small software house,\nbefore going freelance a few years\nlater.\nChess Genius 2 burst onto\nthe scene last year during the\nIntel Chess Grand Prix. This tournament, sponsored by the\nmakers of the ill-fated Pentium\nchip, pitted the best micro-chess\nprogrammes against some of the\nworld's top grandmasters.\n\"When we heard that we\nwere drawn against Kasparov [the\nworld chess champion] in the\nvery first round, we thought we'd be knocked out and go straight\nhome\", recalled Lang. \"It would\nhave been no disgrace to lose. I was absolutely amazed when we\nwon.\"\nOf course for the purist,\nspeed chess competitions are\nviewed as artificial events with\neach player only having a total of\ntwenty five minutes to make their\nmoves. However, the fact that it\nwas Kasparov that had lost,\nresulted in a media explosion.\n\"As soon as we'd won, I knew it was a really big event, a mile stone in computer chess\",\nLang told me. \"Kasparov looked\nabsolutely devastated when the\ngame was over and he went\nbackstage and disappeared from\nthe tournament.\" As another\ngrandmaster commented at the\ntime, \"he [Kasparov] wanted to\ncrush the computer, not just beat\nit\".\nOf course the inexorable\nrise of computers in chess has\nbeen on the cards for a long time.\nIt is said that Napoleon was\nfooled into believing that he had\nbeen beaten by a mechanical\nchess playing machine. In actual\nfact there was a midget secreted\ninside the mechanism, or so the\nstory goes.\nBy the late eighties only the\ntop thousand chess players were\ncapable of beating the best\ncomputers. Then in1989 the\nmainframe, Deep Thought, beat a Danish Grandmaster. Kasparov\nlosing to a micro was seen as a different matter.\nKasparov's hostility to\ncomputers beating him at chess is\nnot merely an intellectual\nreaction, though. As the top\nplayer in the world he makes\naround \u00a31 million a year. As\nmany have commented, who'll\nwant to watch people play chess\nwhen they can buy superior\nsoftware for \u00a3100?\nIt's not something that\nparticularly concerns Richard. \"I think computers add to the game\"\nhe said, \" A car can 'run' faster\nthan a human and it doesn't stop\npeople running. You can play\nagainst a computer to improve\nyour game too\".\nWith Chess Genius 3 selling\naround 10,000 copies a year,\nRichard says \"it's an on-going\nwork\". There are about four\nsimilar programmes on the\nmarket, and they're highly\ncompetitive. Next week Richard\ntakes his latest development to\nHongKong for the World Computer Chess Championships.\nThere's also a revenge match\nagainst Kasparov in Germany. \"I think he'll take computers much\nmore seriously in the future\", said\nLang.\nAnd the in future? \"Well\nmaybe in ten years I 'll get round\nto the Chinese game of Go! I 've\nheard it's quite interesting\". Q I9U1AV95 FELIX DH "

The Sex War on Wheels Edited this week by Owain\nPrater's Fan\nDear Felix,\nI am distressed to see that our\ngood Frater, no doubt lost in\nmeditation and removed from\nconcerns of the temporal realms\nhas ceased to offer words of\nWisdom and Comfort to his\nfollowers.\nThus I am bidding him\ncontinue, for a slightly deranged\nPG student is finding it increasingly\ndifficult to find solace from\nmeetings with the Supervisor,\nwithout Frater Fiam's weekly poetic\ndiscourse.\nYours etc.\nDimitris Fatouros\n2nd Year PhD\nCentre for Quantitative Finance\nMy recollection of the Frater's last\narticle was that it was very much a farewell piece. He has hung up his\nhat in recognition of the futility of\nhis original question, not to\nmention the infinite and reflexive\nnature of the answer he sought. Or\nmaybe he died, suffering horribly in\na car crash. Something like that.\nSort out ICTJ\nDear Owain,\nI know most of our students must\nbe sick of answering questions at\nthe moment, but this is a quick\nreminder about the ICU\nquestionnaire.\nAs a Student Union, it is\nimportant for us to know what\nstudents think of us now, and what\nthey'd like us to do in the future.\nBasically, if we know what you\nwant, we might be able to do\nsomething about it.\nSo, if you've got an opinion,\npick up a questionnaire from: The\nUnion Office, Bookstore, STA\nStudent Travel or Da Vinci's and\nthen return it to us. Oh, and to\nencourage you, STA travel have\ngiven us \u00a3150 work of travel\nvouchers to give to the person who\nfills in the first questionnaire we\npull out of the hat on June 16th. Your opinion matters, so tell us\nwhat you think.\nBest wishes,\nMark,\nEvents and Publicity Manager\nSex Change\nDear Felix,\nI decided to write this piece as a result of a culmination of thoughts\nover a series of events. For a start,\nI am female. I state this because\nfor 2 hours of sitting next to a Frenchman on a bus I was\nmistaken for a male despite\nconversation being continuous\nthough maybe a little one sided-he did most of it. Various gestures\nforced me to this conclusion. Firstly\nhe nudge- nudge wink winked at\ntwo girls sitting next to Us, who\ntittered and glanced slyly sideways.\n\"Strangely\" enough I failed to\nrespond I Secondly since it\nemerged during the course of the\nconversation that I had just been\nto visit my female French\nexchange, he asked whether she\nwas my girlfriend. I thought this\njust a little bit forward. I think that\nunless you feel very comfortable\nwith the idea of homosexuality it is\nnot a question generally asked.\nHowever you never can tell, so I decided not to comment. Further\nmild astonishment ensued when\nhe asked whether I thought my\nFrench exchange was pretty!!\nThirdly he explained the meanings\nof some less than polite French\nwords, which in my opinion would\nnot have happened had he known\nthe truth! Other gestures followed!\nAccustomed as I was (and am) to\nbeing a girl it was not until\njourney's end that I realised what\nmust have occurred. I decided not\nto embarrass the poor man with\nenlightenment and grabbed my\nback pack off the front seat with\nwhat I thought was a manly show\nof strength l So that's how one guy\nbehaves when he meets another.\nInteresting! (or was the whole\nthing done on purpose and really I was the one who was fooled?)\nThis brings me to the second\nevent, the much publicised\nSouthside Incident and the even\nmore publicised Oxford University\nbridge jumper and the difference\nin attitude to males and female\nexposure. Many people regarded\nthe former as a good laugh though\nthere was outrage and pity as well.\nWould the reaction have been the\nsame had the three participants\nbeen girls. From the reaction to the\nOxford girl, I doubt it. When\nwomen expose their natural\nendowments they are more often\nthan not regarded as cheapening\nthemselves- which is what the\nOxford girl has done particularly\nby posing for the Sun. It's hard\nenough for women to get taken\nseriously in higher education\nestablishments and professions as\nit is and unfair as it is. After all we\ndon't see a male page three! Nor\nhave the three Southside\nparticipants jeo pardi sed themselves.\nFinally, perhaps the difference\nin reactions is slightly related to\nthe two terms macho and girl ie. The former though intellectually\nrejected (it is after all not in\nharmony with the new man\nimage!) is still I suspect secretly\nthought complimentary. Being\ncalled a\" girl ie\" by anyone, male\nor female is never complimentary.\nYours Sincerely,\nIda Lister\nBiochemistry UG1\nWe're planning an issue in just\nthree weeks time tackling the\ndifferences between men and\nwomen and looking for much input!\nAll contributions on the subject\nreceived by Friday, June 2nd will be\ndeemed excellent.

    "content": "ELIX\nThe Student Newspaper of Imperial College Not 029 19MAY95 Imperial Stands\nFirm Against NUS\nBY RACHEL WALTERS The campaign to reinstate\nImperial to the National Union\nof Students was overwhelmingly\ndefeated in last week's refer en dum. With a markedly larger\nballot than many had predicted,\n965 students voted to stay out of\nthe NUS while 696 wanted to\nrejoin.\nThe decisive result has been\nseen as a vindication of Imperial\nCollege Union. Criticism of both\nthe pro-NUS campaign and the\nUnion Exec's management had\ndogged the referendum.\nA barrage of complaints\nconcerning discrepancies in campaigning led to a heated debate\nin an emergency executive\nmeeting held just before\ncounting started. Karl Drage led\ncalls for the referendum to be\ndeclared void, but the motion\nwas defeated. \"It would have\nbeen a great shame if the NUS had won in the light of the\ncampaign which was run,\" Dan\nLook, Deputy president (Finance\nand Services) said.\nSarah Thomas, who masterminded the anti-NUS campaign,\nsaid that she was surprised and\ndelighted with the result. Saying\nthat the election had 'turned into\na farce' she was 'just relieved that\nit was all over, to be honest.'\nLucy Chothia, Imperial\nCollege Union president, was\nalso 'very delighted'. She said\nthat the referendum, which had a Union Funding Council budget\nof \u00a31000, was an essential\nassessment of student opinion\nafter the seventeen year period\nsince ICU left the NUS.\nInterestingly, results from\nthe St Mary's side of campus\nshowed that over 80% of the\nmedics actually wanted to rejoin\nthe national body. Explaining\ntheir voting, one St Mary's student speculated that they may\nhave thought that they would get\nlower beer prices by joining.\nThe annual staff/student art exhibition returned to the Sherfield Ante-r this week, writes Owain Bennallack. Visitors are treated to a wide rang\nthemes and mediums with paintings, photography and sculpture all fe a prominently. The exhibition, which is free, has been co-ordinated by\nLeonardo Fine Arts society, who run a variety of courses for both s taf students throughout the year. Speaking at the exhibition's opening, V President Ola Al-de eb commented: \"It's wonderful to see that there i chance to see art at IC\". So if you want to see art at IC get along to the\nexhibition: it runs until June16 th. Some of the works are also for sale.\nCollege Goes To Press\nImperial\nBY OW A IN BENN AL LACK Imperial entered the world of\npublishing last Monday with the\nlaunch of Imperial College Press\n(ICP). The venture is a collaboration between College and the\nSingapore-based World Scientific\nPublishing (WSP), which has a51 per cent share in the initiative.\nDr KK Phua, chairman of\nWSP, and also of IC alumni, said\nthat the press would publish\nbooks and journals in both\nprinted and electronic formats in\na number of different languages.\n\"We hope to develop Imperial\nCollege Press so that it is as good\nas Cambridge University Press or\nOxford University Press - or\nbetter,\" he said.\nPublishing operations are\nrelatively common among top\nuniversities - as well as the\nOxford and Cambridge concerns,\nboth Edinburgh and Manchester\nUniversity have presses.\nRecently the latter had to close\nits scientific publishing wing as\nthe effort to manage both science\nand arts interests became too\ngreat. Given this, it seems almost\nsurprising that ICP has taken so\nlong to arrive.\nThe Rector, Sir Ronald\nOx burgh, expressed similar\nsentiments. \"It's high time that\nan institution of the stature of\nImperial College had its own\npress,\" he said. \"We are excited\nby this venture, which will further strengthen our international network, particularly in\n(continued overleaf)\n\u2022 news one&two&three \u2022 editorial&c red lts three \u2022 incoming five \u2022 s files: picking up on radio\nseven \u2022 features: a moving experience part 2 and information superhighway eight \u2022\nback chat: with computer chess master Richard Lang nine \u2022 xtra curricular: soaring eleven \u2022\nstandby: lo-fi thrills twelve&thirteen \u2022 eight day guide fourteen&fifteen \u2022 sport: airborne sixteen Q "

However with only\nten days to decide whether or not\nDon Juan should be institutional is ed permanently, Dr Mickler has to\npersuade him to 'drop this facade'.\nDon Juan's tales are certainly\ntall, like hiding in an arabian harem\nwith 1,500 women, but as the film\nprogresses you end up wanting to\nbelieve in this fantasy world to\nescape from the dreariness of the\neveryday life. It's becomes a question Dr Mickler has to face; is\nthe reality of his life more desirable\nthan this fantasy world?\nThe film's passion is addictive\nand this is what makes it so\nenjoyable. It's feelings of love,\npassion and romance will linger\nlong after the tale is ended.\nHaving passed up directing\nBatman Forever, Tim Burton\nconcentrates his unique macabre\nvisual and directing styles on the\nstory of Edward D. Wood Jnr. This\ninfamous cross-dressing director\nwas recently voted 'worst director of\nall time' thanks to such Z grade\nmovies as Bride of the Atom and\nPlan 9 from Outer Space.\ned wood focuses on Wood's( Johnny Depp) struggle in\nHollywood to make his films whilst\njuggling his personal life and in\nparticular his secret passion for\ndressing in women's clothing. The\nfilm also deals with Wood's friendship with the washed-up,\nmorphine addicted former movie\nstar Bela Lugosi (brilliantly played\nby Oscar winner, Martin Landau).\nOpening with one of the most\ninnovative and original opening\nsequences for a long time, the film\nis shot in black and white which\nallows Tim Burton to recreate his\ntypical gothic, brooding visual style.\nWith an often very amusing script,\nthe film moves along at a fairly\nsedate pace and although it runs\nslightly longer than needed,\nnevertheless it never ceases to be\nengaging.\nPerhaps it's true to say that it\ndoes tend to concentrate more on\nEd Wood's film making, treating the\ntransvestism as a side-line which is\nnever really explored. And it is the\nfilms that Wood 'makes' which are\nthe driving force of the movie.\nAlways struggling to raise the\nmoney and sometimes shooting as\nmany as thirty scenes a day, what\nWood lacked in talent he made up\nfor in drive. He wasn't bothered\nabout the quality of the films so\nlong as his vision wasn't compromised. In a particularly\neffective scene Orson Welles tells\nhim to shoot his vision and nobody\nelse's. As winter approaches in 18th Century Scotland, highlands' clan\nchief Rob Roy MacGregor (L/ am\nNeeson) enters a business venture\nwith the Marquis of Montrose (John\nHurt). The Marquis' tax collector\nand English social parasite,\nCunningham (Tim Roth), however\nconspire to steal the clan's money\nand thus they risk losing their land\nto the Marquis.\nWhenever Hollywood gets its\nhands on a historical icon, it hashes\nout a story involving a great deal\nmore passion, drama and action\nthan what really happened. There's nothing wrong with that but when\nthe casting is mismatched (Robin\nHood aka Kevin Costner) it is hard\nto trust the story.\nrob roy follows a similar\npattern; Liam Neeson being Irish\nfails to convince the audience he a Scot and so Rob Roy fails to hit the\nall important culture button. The\nfilm throws you between Rob Roy's love of his wife, Mary, and the theft\nof the money. Rob Roy tries to mix\nthe two stories but in the end the\nfilm just becomes a big mess.0\ndon juan de marco\nThis season's key idea is\nrefreshing simplicity, with extreme\nattention to detail. So, whilst the\nsleeveless shift remains an\nessential it's becomes slightly\nmore structured than before; team\nit up with chic headgear, sophisticated sunglasses, well cut hair,\nperfect nails and pedicured feet in\nstartlingly high stilettoes.\nUnderwear has to uphold the\nunhindered line and create the\n50's ultimate hourglass form. To\ndo this, M&S have new seamless\nsatin underwear and Gossard\nhave produced a waist clinching,\ncleavage producing basque.\nBefore we 90's women frown,\nremember that as Jill Tweedie\nsays, \"You don't have to signal a social conscience by looking like a frump - lace knickers won't hasten\nthe Holocaust\".\nAccording to Vogue, the\nessential basic wardrobe for this\nseason comprises of the dress, the\ntwin set( buy one size too small), a waist ed linen suit, a pencil skirt\nand skinny top. Pencil knee-length\nskirts can't really be carried by\nanything other than heels - as\nhigh and thin as you can stand up\nin. The hottest, indeed the only,\nfootwear of the year comes in\nwhite patent; whether 3\" tall or\nloafers. For those with a life to\nlead that involves walking more\nthan three paces in a day, the fun\nalternative is those childhood\nfavourites - jelly shoes (Ware-house \u00a39.99).\nWarehouse is also currently\nstocking a fabulous range of\nskinny, lycra based tops - in the\nvery best of 50s' styles, and even\nbetter, 90's prices. Sticking with\nthe childhood-revisited theme, for\nthose who like to have a startling\neffect on passers-by, the new\npalette influence is citrus, with\ntangerine sheen, lime and glowing\nyellow. Best buys in this range are\nfrom Kangol, Oasis and Jeffrey\nRogers. The latter also stock an\nexcellent pair of three quarter-length gingham capri pants for\nonly \u00a316.99.\nReturning to attention to\ndetail, the latest acclaimed\naccessory is the perfectly groomed\nman. Personally I prefer the old\nidea of a lap dog - as Ms Carelli\nso elegantly expresses it \"I never\nmarried because there was no\nneed. I have three pets at home\nwhich answer the same purpose\nas a man. I have a dog which\ngrowls every morning, a parrot\nwhich swears all the afternoon\nand a cat which comes home late\nat night.\"\u00a9\nFELIX "

The small fire\nwas put out by Maths' Safety\nOfficer, Geoff Reason, and\nstudents were given an extra 15\nminutes at the end of the exam to\nmake up for the distraction.\nVernon Mc Lure, the\nAcademic Registrar, has suggested that the Board of\nExaminers will be advised to\nmake allowance for students\nlosing train of thought during\nthe interruption. He discounted\nsuggestions that the examination\nwould have to be rerun saying\nthat unless there had been a major breach of rules the\nmajority would \"rather get on\nand get over with it\".\nPub Watching!\nThe rising number of drunken\nincidents ( FELIX10051028) affecting Imperial College is\nbeing tackled by local police and\ncollege drinking establishments\nwith a new scheme called 'Pub\nWatch'. At present an anomaly\nexists whereby students banned\nfrom one establishment, for\ninstance the Union Bar, can still\ndrink in either the Holland Club\nor Southside.\nSecurity Control in Sherfield\nwill coordinate a programme\nwhereby descriptions of banned\nstudents will be posted in each\nbar. PC Clive Coleman suggests\nthat as offensive activity in any of\nthe campus bars would force\nstudents to drink outside college\n(and hence pay higher prices)\nstudent behaviour should\nimprove. The 'Queens Arms' is\ninvolved in the scheme and Clive\nhopes that other local hostelries\ncould soon also be included in\nthe initiative.\nEven people who look\nsuspicious could be included, as\nPC Coleman points out that\nlicensees do not actually need a reason to bar prospective\ndrinkers. The police hope to have\nthe scheme 'up and running\npretty soon'.\nPimlico Safe\nQuestions over the future of the\nPimlico Connection tutoring\nscheme, raised in the Times\nHigher Educational Supplement\nearlier this month, have been\nquashed by Dr Sinclair Goodlad.\nThe Head of the Humanities\nDepartment dismissed the\npaper's announcement that 'the\nImperial scheme may be for the\nchop'. Financing for the programme has been guaranteed for\nthe next five years.\nTop Gear Stalled\nLast Friday's Top Gear feature -due to show Imperial engineers\nin a kit car building race - was\ncancelled at the last minute. The\npresenter booked to do the\nvoiceover wasn't available. BBC sources have suggested that the\nevent's screening has been postponed until next autumn's series\nof the popular programme.\nBriley's Rogues Gallery\nTerry Briley, Deputy Head of\nSecurity, is planning to set up a 'rogue's gallery' of Imperial\ncriminals. Armed with a new\nPolaroid camera, he intends to\nrecord suspicious incidents and\ncollege intruders so that repeat\noffenders can be easily identified.\nMr Briley also intends to extend\nthe plan to include cooperation\nwith other London Colleges.\n\"People make a living out of\ndoing over Universities,\" he said.\nThe plan is part of the\ncontinuing security clampdown\non the ever-growing college\ncrime problem. Speaking to\nFELIX, PC Clive Coleman said\nthat over 50% of crimes in the\nBelgravia sector, which includes\nKnightsbridge, occurred at\nImperial. Recent incidents\ninclude a break in at Dr Learner's flat in Princes Gardens,\nafter which a man was chased by\nCollege Security but lost in Exhibition Road.\nInput Rejected\nImperial College Estates look set\nto go ahead with their Strategy\nReview without encouraging\nstudents to comment upon the\nproposals. Leading up to the\npublication of a final strategy in\nJune, the review was issued to\ncollege staff in March. It\ndiscusses the development of\nstudent accommodation and the\nfuture of the whole of IC's estate.\nWhilst the College claims to\nhave a policy of openness, Mr Ian\nCaldwell, Director of Estates, has\ndeclined to give FELIX a copy\nof the report. It is suggested that\nhe would prefer that students\ncommented on the final strategy\nrather than misinterpreted the\ninitial document. In the light of\nthis decision, college staff will be\nable to influence the plans but\nstudents will not be able to\ndiscuss the proposals, only\nmerely reflect upon the final con-clu s ions. A friend returned from a jealousy\nprovoking trip to South, and\nthen North, America earlier this\nweek. Whilst she portrays\nrainforests in the 'get there\nbefore they're gone' manner I'd have expected, her reaction to the\nStates is more of a surprise. She\ndescribes dead suburban towns\ncrawling with Beavis and\nButthead stereotypes and of the\nfear of walking at night - and\nthese were college towns!\nAlthough this is an almost\nclich ed view of America, for me\nit gained an added poignancy\nthanks to her delivery. She is\nusually unbearably optimistic\nabout places and people, and in\nAmerica only the madness of\nNew York seemed to her real.\nI mention it because I find it\nfascinating that there is a country\nbehind the gore-bytes we read\nand hear. The first three things\nthat spring to my mind if I think\nof the US are the OJ Simpson\ntrial, the recent Oklahoma\nbombing and a trashy story about\na chat show involving a woman\nwho slept with 251 men in ten\nhours - filmed, the video is\navailable for purchase. One's initial thought is that this is just\ntabloid sensationalism but with\nyears of repeated doses, hypochondria gives way to disease.\nRecently there has been\nmuch debate over arming the\npolice. Too often America is\nbrought up as an example of a tough police force - even though\neverybody knows about the\nmurder counts and gun law.\nMaybe we're subconsciously\nmotivated by the comforting\nthought of Cagney and Lacey\npulling a gun on the streets of\nLondon, maybe scared of\nseemingly increasing crime we'd like to feel safer. The problem is\nthat it is so difficult to determine\nwhether crime is actually on the\nincrease. Detection rates, changes\nin the definition of laws, changes\nin those you consider covered by\nthe law (it's only in the last\nhundred years that people have\nreally expected the poor to be\nanything other than criminal:\nwitness the illegality of poverty\nin centuries past). All can\nconfuse the picture.\nThe growing power of the\nmedia as the only voice of\n'authority' has also, I'm sure,\ncontributed to this perspective less 'bloodbath'. Even here we\nsuffer Crimewatch UK and a barrage of lurid news reports. So\nit surprises people that the most\ngruesome killing of Police\nOfficers happened in the sixties.\nThe media has a fundamental\ndesire to show the world as a bad\nplace, in order to sell product.\nThe scary thing about\nAmerica is it seems to be true!\nCredits\nEditor Owain Bennallack\nPrinter Andy Thompson\nAssistant Printer Jeremy Thomson\nBusiness Manager Tim Bavister\nAdvertising Manager Wei Lee\nEditorial Team\nArt & Literature Jon Jordan\nCinema Wei Lee\nClubs, Societies & Union Piers Daniell\nColumns Marcus Alexander\nFeatures Kate Cox\nLayout and Design Mark Baker\nMusic Vik Bansal\nNews Rachel & Co.\nPhotography Ivan Chan & Diana Harrison\nPuzzles Tim St Clair\nS Flles Rebecca Mileham\nEight Day Guide Jeremy Thomson\nSport Juliette Decock and Mark Baker\nStandby Jon Jordan\nEditorial Assistance\nCollating Last Week J.

    "content": "Features\nMoving Experiences II by Owain\nl though I have stressed that Paul is a competent individual, I should make\nclear that he shared some of our\ncollective traits. We left him to look for a house and he, competently, decided to pay\nsomeone else to do it. The agent's name was\nBob. He didn't like Indians very much, he\ntold Paul, and he hoped that none of our party\nwere of this or any other Bob-deigned\nundesirable class. He'd had a lot of trouble\nwith Jews and the Irish were difficult to\nmanage too. It seemed a weird sort of inverted\nracism (Bob himself was dark-skinned) that\nled him to categorise his wards purely on\ngenetic background: I have no doubt at all\nthat when approaching landlords he got in\n'they're white' before 'they're non-smokers'.\nHe didn't further his case as an\nimpressive and assured agent when we arrived\nat his office, with a cheery Paul telling us that\ntogether they had found the perfect place. I have a generous spirit, and when I saw that\nhis office had been ransacked, his filing\ncabinets emptied onto every available surface\nand the office stripped bare of any modern,\npost-sixties office equipment I felt we should\nleave him to recover the bare essentials of his\nagency business. But he was a plucky man: he\nwelcomed us and dived beneath the\nthousands of pieces of paper littering his desk\nto find one with 'Paul - not Indian' written\nacross the top.\nThe poor mentally retarded immigrant\nwho he employed in the office (due I presume\nto the unwavering goodness he had already\ndisplayed) stood in the corner and repeated\neverything Bob told us with a 'Bob is very\ngood' tagged on to the end. Bob explained the\ndetails of the wonderful three bedroomed\napartment we would be moving into.\nPrincipally it was halfway up the building and\nBob felt that properties always improved as\none ascended skyward. (Only later did I watch\na cockroach struggling to escape up the\nbathroom wall and realise his reasoning). It\nwas close to college - true. The landlord was\nvery nice (more very polite, I later found out,\nlike the villains in James Bond). His main\nrecommendation was that he had turned away\nmost of Imperial's students that very\nafternoon because he had promised the flat to\nPaul. We'd be fools to miss out.\nI must admit that I was carried away\nwith the whole romance of it. Plus, I knew\nthat I would be living on the streets in a couple of days and that lit up the future\napartment with a rosy, super long-life glow.\nAt that point I believed we would actually be\nvisiting the flat before buying it - indeed the\nassistant had phoned the landlord minutes\nbefore. Most of their conversation had\ncentred on money rather than a prospective\nvisit, but we had faith in Bob.\nWe couldn't unfortunately enter the flat\non arrival, due to a lack of keys on the agents\npart, but it certainly looked as if it was\nundergoing the promised 'renovations'. To be\nhonest it looked as though it would have been\nfalling down without them. I was too busy at\nwork to worry much - and after all, my\nrequest had just been for a roof over my head.\nThe others moved our possessions\nacross whilst I languished in the office all day,\nas recounted in an early editorial. But the\nfateful moment couldn't be delayed. At about\n2.00am we unlocked the door. The light\ndidn't work but dawn's glow eventually came.\nI went into denial.\nInformation SuperGxhibiton\nmmm\nA new exhibition at the Science Museum aims to give the public a better idea of\nwhat the Information Superhighway could do for them. Mark Baker logs on...\nSCIENCE MUSE UH LONDON\nThe Information Superhighway (ISH) does not\nexist. So says the Science Museum in a new mini-exhibition. But why have an exhibition about\nsomething that doesn't even exist yet? (and might\nnever exist, the exhibit goes on to tell you).\nThe simple answer is that the press\ncoverage of the Internet / ISH has increased by\nover 1000 times in the last two years, and most of\nthe public is probably still wondering what all the\nfuss is about. This exhibition is a great\nopportunity to find out more about the current\ntechnology and what the future may hold. You\ncan even have a go 'live' on the Internet, with\n'Lifeguards' standing by to help you out (should\nyou fall off your digital surfboard).\nThe exhibition itself is very small, and is\nlocated on the first floor of the museum. To find\nit, go through the barriers, straight ahead, first\nsteps, it's right in front of you. It's fairly gaudy to\nlook at, but presentation aside, the content is very\ngood. As an example, here is their definition of\nthe ISH:\n\"The information superhighway will allow\npeople to send and receive words, sound and\nmoving pictures, anywhere in the world, over\ncomputer networks.\"\nThe language used is deliberately nontechnical but without too much skimping on\ninformation or simplifying of issues. As well as\nseveral interactive 'simulations' of using the\nInternet and ISH, there are eight PCs ready to use\nin a special 'Surf City' section. With these PCs\nyou can browse the World Wide Web and get a taster of the kind of information and services\navailable on the Internet today. Very friendly and\nhelpful b of fins are on-hand to enable even the\nmost computer-illiterate of museum-goers to try\nout the system. When I went I saw a young girl\nlooking up Hockey teams, next to her dad who\nwas looking for travel information. This is the\nbest part of the whole exhibit, and is popular with\nvisitors. \"One lad sat there for four hours, and\neven worked out how to use email.\" a 'Lifeguard'\nsaid.\nI was expecting to be patronised, but\ninstead was informed. This is an exhibition that\nis well worth seeing, even if - like myself - you\nalready know something (or a lot) about the\nInternet, and even more so if you don't. The exhibition runs until 3 September,\nwhen it goes on tour. Entrance is free to ICU card\nholders or \u00a35 adults, \u00a32.60 concession. Q FELIX "

    "content": "The S Files\nVoices out of the air: the radio centenary\nUNWIRED FOR SOUND\nRADIO BAUDCAST\n2\n0 YEARS OF IC RADIO\nOne hundred years ago this year, a twenty-one year old Italian\ninvented the first practical wireless telegraph set. The following year\nGuglielmo Marconi patented his invention in England - the Italian\nauthorities having rejected his proposal - and radio was born.\nTen years elapsed before the first transmission of speech, and in the same month that the BBC began broadcasting, King George V delivered his Christmas Day message by radio, addressing \"men and women so cut\noff by the snows and the deserts that only voices out of the air can reach them\".\nToday, the BBC World Service reaches 130 million listeners world wide.\nRadio saturates the airwaves: what's the next step? This week in the S files, we\nponder two developments. In last Monday's Guardian newspaper, Kevin Kelly\n(Editor of Wired magazine and acclaimed, yet not over-exposed, guru) compared\nsociety's resistance to early radio with current resistance to the Internet: \"Early\nradio was too hard to use, and there was nothing to listen to, just radio enthusiasts\ntalking to each other. In the beginning it wasn't thought of as a communications\ndevice at all. These things\naren't always obvious.\"\nBut the Internet is leading\nradio in a different area. The\nhuge amount of information on\nthe Internet means that an\nautomatic scanning programme\nwhich selects items of interest\nand ignores the rest has already\nbeen developed. Nicholas Negroponte of MIT saw the\nSame development ahead for Happy to be the only student radio station in London\nradio when interviewed on The Network, a BBC Radio 4 programme: \"The big\ndifference is that information can now be processed at the receiving end. I think\nthat radio in fact will be where most of the innovation takes place. It can listen to 5\n- 10,000 hours or radio on your behalf and record little chunks for you. It's already\nmuch more digital than the video world; eventually I think that car radios and\nhome radios won't have an on-off switch any more.\"\nOn the right, hear what Dave Cohen, former IC Radio Station manager has to\nsay about our very own 20-year-old station.

It's still the\n| only broadcasting student radio station in London.\ni.I One of the first songs they played was Elton John'sI Crocodile Rock and so the crocodile became the station'si mascot. I think the actual crocodile got thrown away, but\nUohn Allen, the first Station manager (who is now\nj controller of LBC) returns every year for the Croc Club\nI dinner when old members get together.\nIt's true that we're still broadcasting on leaky coaxial\ncable, 19 years after opening. To go FM would mean we\nwould have to contend with other local stations like\nCapital FM, though. We might be able to get a temporary\nFM licence, but they cost a lot of money, and we'd need a transmitter which would also be expensive.\nIf IC Radio was run by a sabbatical, more time could\nbe spent on broadening the listener ship by increasing\nfundraising efforts to pay for things like transmitters, and\ndevoting more time to organising shows and training\npeople.\nI The problem is that the listener ship is restricted to |\nSouthside and so advertisers aren't interested. But until\nj funds are raised, we can't increase the audience. If one\n| year the distribution was increased, by laying land lines\\ over to the Union bars, the college common rooms and all\nI the halls of residence, or better still by obtaining a wide\n[area broadcast licence, a large part of the problem would\n|be solved. After that the Station Manager could\nI concentrate on programming.\nAt the moment IC Radio is very important because it\nprovides a unique opportunity for students to have a go at\n| radio broadcasting, not to mention being excellent fun. Its\nf significance would further increase as a college-wide\n1 source of information and entertainment if its profile was\nraised and these changes took place.\"\nVI\n\u2022O\"U: j< jr oo go\nIT. .3\"T3\nno Ji\nCD< CO\n.
