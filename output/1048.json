At the\nappointed hour only his daughter Billie turns up\nat the airport, and the search for his wife begins.\nThis search takes the unlikely pair through\nGreece, France, Amsterdam and situations\nevoked breathtakingly by Winton's excellent\nwriting.\n\"Maybe old Pete-the-Post was right you never\nreally knew anybody, not even those you loved.\nPeople have shadows, secrets\". The main themes\nof this book revolve around how well you really\nknow people - your wife or yourself. We see\nparanoia and recklessness in Fred Scully as the\ntumult of possibilities flows through his mind.\nYou feel sorry for him, angry at him and eventually relieved when the brilliantly thought out\nending appears. Alongside Fred, his seven-year-old daughter suffers horribly but has the stronger\nwill, dragging her father up just at the moment\nhe looks likely to stumble. \"Do you think someone can love too much?\" she asks at one point;\nthroughout the book she is the only one whose\nlove is constantly pure.\nThe book screams 'Booker Prize shortlisted'\non the front cover, promising much but delivering more. It's a very thought-provoking thriller\nand with the wonderful mental images it conjures up, that old clich e'un put down able' is fully\njustified. Whether you want contemporary fiction at its absolute pinnacle or just a damn good\nread, \u00a35.99 is a small price to pay for this book.\"\u2022:\n:\n::\nM:.:: \u2022;\n;;:;J; cs W?^:; lJ\n-^?\nJ?; simon baker\nIt has not been a particularly good week or two\nfor women in politics. The First Lady of\nAmerica, being an accomplished lawyer, is about\nto embark on a bus man's holiday by appearing\nbefore a federal grand jury over the Whitewater\naffair. Hie real problem is that because of this\nand other legal problems, Bill Clinton may be\ndeclared bankrupt, which could prove a tad\ntricky. Were it to happen over here, it would\nmean instant loss of parliamentary seat, but I don't know what the situation is Stateside. Call\nme cruel, but as someone who is not an enormous fan of the President and much less so of his\nwife, I do find it all very funny.\nIn terms of amusement however, this\nAmerican debacle is but an episode of Gag Tag\ncompared to the mess that Harriet Harman has\ncreated for Tony Blair. The Shadow health\nspokesman, not simply a Labour MP but one\nwho is supposed to take collective responsibility\nfor party policy (now there's a novel idea, Tony),\nsees fit to exercise a choice that she and her party\nare seeking to prevent others from making. If\nthat is not hypocrisy, then I demand a refund on\nmy dictionary. I'm afraid that such\ndouble standards are not acceptable,\nand to use the defence that it is\nwrong of Conservative and dissenting Labour MPs to drag the education of her son into the political arena\nis laughable, since she is responsible\nfor such a situation. Don't get me\nwrong, I am not opposed to her exercising the choice to send him where\nshe and her husband want. That is\none of the great educational reforms\nof recent times. What I cannot\naccept is her continued opposition to\na system that she has given her blessing to by her\nactions. She should resign, although I suspect\nthat the enormous pressure that Tony Blair has\nbrought to bear on his parliamentary party\nmeans she will probably survive. This Stalinist\nsuppression of dissent driven, I dare say, by chief\nspin doctor Peter Mandelson, is not a happy\nreflection on an opposition party that I and many\nothers may not have agreed with, but whose\nintegrity we once respected.\nI think I ought to stick closer to home.\nUnfortunately, that means that the subject of the\nBMS building is unavoidable. We hear that there\nis a little problem with routine waste at the site,\nsuch as mercury and asbestos. Routine waste! I'd like to know their definition of dangerous waste.\nWeapons grade plutonium, perchance? The\nsmallpox virus? Not only is mercury very toxic,\nbut it is also very expensive to get rid of safely. If\nthese blok es are so blas e about toxic waste, they\nmight like to come and clean out my fridge. Still,\nat least the boys from STOIC were spared from\nthe perils by being chucked off the site. As any\n3rd year chemist trying to listen to the pearls of\nwisdom spilling forth from our lecturers will tell\nyou, work has started in earnest, and yet we see\nthat planning permission still hasn't been granted. As my dear old mum\nsaid, it'll end in tears.\nWell, we had another double roll-over jackpot. The huge sum of\nmoney, some say, is capable of\nwreaking havoc on the lives of the\npoor. It's not wreaked havoc on my\nlife. Not even ate nner since it start-ed. Even with Anthea Turner on\nholiday, I still can't win. It could be\nyou, so why not me?\nh Li\n\n"

FELIX FRIDAY FEBRAURY 2ND1996 NEWS\nAcademic Affairs\nBY MARK BRIDGE\nThe annual Academic Affairs\nhalf day took place on\nWednesday this week, in which\nstudent academic and departmental representatives discussed\nall manner of topics with academic and college staff.\nThis year, as last, the event\nwas organised by Matt Szyndel,\nthe R CSU Academic Affairs\nOfficer. The meeting was a constructive one where students got\nan opportunity to raise issues and\nexpress their views. Those present included the Pro-Rector for\nEducational Quality, Prof Alan\nSwanson, the Academic\nRegistrar, Vernon McClurc,\nSenior Tutors and College\nTutors, and the Director of\nEstates, Ian Caldwell. Sarah\nWhite, ICU president, chaired\nthe meeting.\nOf the many subjects raised,\ntop up tec s, photocopying, calculators for exams and library\nprovision featured prominently,\nWith a range of additional comments and concerns about the\nBMS project, Catering and the\nsometimes questionable content\nof Clubs and Socs publications.\nCollege-wide photocopying\ncard variations was a topic of\ncontention with many students\nand was also raised last year. The\nmatter has proved difficult to\nresolve; Professor Swanson\nexplained that the various college departments had their own\nbudgets from which they sub-sidi sed the cost of photocopying\nand that it would not be fair for\na department to use up photocopying funds on non-depart-mental personnel.\nFirst and second year students will enter codes instead of\ntheir names on exam scripts\nfrom this summer. The idea\nbehind this is to prevent any\nassumptions as to student capability on the part of markers.\nThese alpha-numeric codes\nmight create difficulties though.\nThe Senior Tutor for\nComputing, Margaret Cunningham, whose department has used\nnumeric naming systems in\nexams for some years now,\nexplained how there could be\nproblems under exam conditions, where students simply do\nnot copy their numbers correct-ly. Margaret Goodgame, one of\nthe College Tutors, added that\nillegible numbers were far harder\ncontinued on page four\nPHOTO: ALEX FEAKES\nThe Fire Station on Fulham Road's loss of an engine and 24 firefighters will mean that fire cover for Evelyn Gardens will come from\nthe more distant Kensington Station.\ncontinued from from pi iRc tion\" at the meeting to make\nwill not be made until aLF CDA their position clear.

The SWSS members here achieved little not i cable success handing out their flyers or convincing passers-by to champion\nthe cause of Arthur Scargill's Socialist Labour Party, and specifically that of the S LP candidate, Brenda Nixon, in yesterday's Hemworth by-election.\nNews in brief\nBY THE NEWS TEAM\nAssessment postponed\nIan Caldwell, Director of\nEstates, has revealed that the\nBiomedical Sciences building\nmay not go to a planning meeting\nuntil February 21st. The delay in\nobtaining planning permission to\ndemolish the old Chemistry\nbuilding, which should have been\ngranted at last month's commit-tee, could put the project behind\nschedule.\nThe current timetable for\nthe various stages of the construction stipulates that work on\nthe building should start within\nthe next few months. There is\nalso a contingency period of\napproximately six months which\nhas been allowed for, just in case\nthis sort of delay occurs.\nHowever, this is not the first\ndelay to the project, as the contractors were slow to move on to\nthe site at the end of last year,\nand this took up some of the\nslack in the schedule. Subsequently, there is little time for\nthe planning decision to be held\nup, and Mr Caldwell admit ed that 'things would get serious' if\nthat were the case. He remained\nconfident, however, that permission for the demolition would be\ngranted.\nICU doormat mislaid?\nThe continuing saga over the disappearance of Imperial College\nUnion's front door mat took an\nunexpected twist on Thursday\nafternoon when it went missing\nagain from Royal Hollway's Union building.\nThis is the second time that\nRoyal Holloway have claimed\nignorance of the whereabouts of\nthe mat, even though they\nadmitted to having it in their\npossession last term. The mat\nwent missing from 'outside the\ndoor' of the RH Entertainments\nand Marketing sabbatical's office.\nHowever, this was only discovered when Sarah White and Matt\nCrompton phoned from IC to\narrange a time to collect it.\nThe disgruntled Imperial\nsabbaticals were informed that\nnone of the officers at Royal\nHolloway knew anything about\nthe mat; it had just been left for\nICU to pick up. Sarah White was\nsaid to be unimpressed with\nRH's attitude, and come mn ted that it was irresponsible to leave\na \u00a3250 rug just lying around outside an office.\n\n"

    "content": "If flip If Tlie Shaman-.think Ebeneezer's good/ti icy want to have a look at what n^ al Shamans are up to. In recent years\nindigenous healers and American pharmacologists have been collaborating in research which has led to the development of new .drugs - drugs that may prove ii ser|| in the treatment of a range of diseases including AIDS.\nMedicinal practices employed by traditional healers have long been\nregarded with scepticism by many\nWestern practitioners but research by ethno botanists scientists who study the botanical\nknowledge of indigenous, or other traditional communities - suggests that there\nis much to be taken seriously within less\northodox medical systems. Indeed, eth-no botanists have shown that many mod- j em therapeutics were originally discovered during the systematic evaluation of\nmedicinal agents used by non-industrial\nsocieties. For example, the pain killers\nmorphine and cocaine, the heart drug\ndigoxin, and the anti-leuk emi c agents vin-blast in e and v in cristi ne have all been discovered this way. Most recently, researchers from\nAJDS-conscious America have discovered a number of novel compounds which exhibit particularly potent anti-viral activity.\nPaul Cox, is an ethno botanist based at the\nBrigham Young University in Utah, US. Having\nspent his undergraduate years in Samoa, he continued his studies at postgraduate level, looking\nat the ways in which Samoan people used and\nmanaged the rain forest plants of their South\nPacific island. Since that time (the late 1970's), Cox and his co-workers have examined the\np harm a co logical activity of many Samoan medicinal plants, one of which demonstrates strong\nactivity against the human immunodeficiency\nvim s HIV-1.\nSponsored by the US National Cancer\nInstitute (NCI), who have strong interests in\nboth anti-cancer and anti-HIVtherapeutics, Cox\nbegan his latest search by concentrating on\nSamoan plants used in the treatment of viral dis-eases. Initially, plants of interest were collected in\nSamoa, and sent to the NCI laboratories for\np harm a co logical analysis. Any species showing\nsignificant anti-viral activity could then be investigated further, using a process known as\n%J v activity-directed\n\u00a3\"S fractionation,\nif***?

In\nthis way, one plant, Homalanthus nutans, has\nbeen identified as a source of a powerful anti-HIV compound. Used in Samoan medicine in the treatment of the viral disease\nyellow fever, Homalanthus nutans has\nbeen found to contain the novel\nanti-viral agent prost rat in which\n!\nseems likely to be taken into\nclinical trials in the near\nfuture.\nEncouraged by the success of Cox and other\nethno botanists, several pharmaceutical\ncompanies have\nr begun to show\nincreasing\nJ interest\nin an\nmm urn\nFoxglove (\"Digitalis Purpurea} has\nbeen used in the treatment of heart\ndisease since the formal discovery\nof its biological activity in 1775.\nThe eighteenth century physician\nWilliam Withering initiated\nresearch into this powerful drug\nwhich is still in common use\namongst heart sufferers throughout\nthe Western world.\nethno-directed\napproach to\ndrug\nprospect\ning. Indeed, in\n1990, one com-p any, the SanFrancisco-based\nShaman\nPharmaceuticals, was established with the specific aim of using an ethno botanical approach to\ndrug discovery. Using a multidisciplinary team\nwhich includes medics, natural product\nchemists and ethno botanists, this approach has\nso far resulted in the development of two new\nproducts which are already in clinical trials:\nProvir\u2122, an oral product for the treatment of\nrespiratory viral infections, and Virend\u2122, a topical anti-viral product for the treatment of her-pes. Shaman also has continuing programmes\ntargeted at identifying novel compounds for use\nagainst fungal infections. So far two anti fungal candidates have been discovered, while investigations into native treatments for diabetes\nhave also generated a number of promis-. ing leads.\nHowever, while the indications\nfrom ethno botanists are enc our aging, the news is not all good.\nThe identification of plants\nwhich yield valuable therapeutic agents, may well lead\nto serious problems of over-harvesting. In addition, further problems associated\nwith the exploitation of traditional communities are likely to\noccur where less scrupulous\nresearchers are involved. Providing\nsolutions to these problems will not be\neasy, requiring the development of both\nlegal mechanisms and ethical codes, to protect traditional peoples' knowledge and\ntheir natural resources. Fortunately, ethno botanists in the UK, the US and elsewhere,\nare currently working to provide effective\nsolutions. If they succeed, the global population may gain from the long-term benefits\nof traditional medicine, and other ethno botanical knowledge.\nCath Cotton\n\n"

The\nhighlight ol the day was when we all plucked\nup the courage to try the \"Sugar Bowl\" - a twelve foot deep swimming pool with a long\nslope going into it. What made this bowl so\nlethal was that the apex went past the\nvertical - and formed an overhang, so to\nmake it out we needed\nto get tip to a ridiculous\nspeed and have no fear\nat all.

Having\narrived more than ten minutes late, I spent the\nnext couple of minutes wondering how I'd managed to get through the door - the ticket said,\n'strictly no admittance after the film begins'.\nWhen I did finally look up at the screen, the\nfirst thing I saw was three men being shot to\ndeath by someone in a plastic white mask which\nwouldn't have looked out of place in Star Wars.\nOh great! Tbis really wasn't worth mn ning all the\nway from the tube station to see!\nAs it turned out, I was wrong; it was worth\nit, and I was pleasantly surprised.\nThe film is set in Los Angeles, where Neil\nMcCauley (Robert DeNiro) and his sidekicks\nNate, Michael and Chris (Val Kilmer) plan and\ncarry out a series of robberies. McCauley is a professional criminal who protects himself by not\ngetting too close to anyone: \"There's nothing in\nmy life that I can't walk away from in 30 seconds\nflat when the heat is around the comer\".\nFrom the outset, he and his gang are pursued by Vincent Hannah (Al Pacino), a detective\nin the LA police department. Like McCauley,\nHannah is dedicated to his profession and, apart\nfrom a crumbling third marriage, doesn't have\nmuch of a life beyond it. He doesn't even let his\nstep-daughter's attempted suicide get in the way\nof his work.\nThis film is about the power struggle\nbetween the two: neither will give up trying to\nget what they want, and right up until the final\nscene we're still wondering who is going to end\nup killing who.\nAlthough almost everyone seems to get hurt\n(mentally and physically), shot or beaten up, the\nfilm rarely gets boring. My only criticism is that\nit has a feeble ending, but I doubt that I could\nhave thought of a better one. In short, this film\nis good but not brilliant, but definitely worth\no ing to see.\nvideo: mad bull 34 part L^ Strange title, strange story - yes, it's Manga. If\nyou've been brought up on Mickey Mouse and\nTom & Jerry, Japanese anime will definitely\nshock. No more flan fights, this is direct from\nfrom Walt Disney's alter ego.\nPart 1: Scandal is a tale of sex, d mg s, vio-len ce, corruption and Diazaburo, a new recruit\nto the 34th precinct of the New York police\ndepartment. Diazaburo's first day would have\nbeen agent ie introduction but for his new part-ner, Mad Bull, one of those cops who shoots first\nbut can't ask questions later because the unfortunate villain no longer has a head, let alone his\nears (sounds gruesome). When Diazaburo isn't ducking gunfire, he's reluctantly following Mad\nBull to a succession of cat houses, and it soon\nbecomes apparent that his partner is running a protection racket.\nMad Bull 34 is certainly a violent cartoon\nand not one of the more inspiring Manga titles.\nThere are plenty more videos available with far\nbetter animation and story lines, but this being\npart one of a series, things may improve later.\nIn the shops from February 5th \u00a39.99\n\n"

But regardless of your political disposition, it could never\nhave been possible to have the\nmassive increase in higher education that we've seen over the\npast few years without students\nhaving to pay part of their own\nway. (Apparently you would\nhave to put 7p on the flat rate of\nincome tax if you were to return\ngrant levels across the board to\nthe level they were in 1979.)\nI don't particularly think\nthat charging students a one-off\n\u00a3300 lump sum to study at\nImperial would be that awful,\nbut I can't see how that would\never be the end of it. From what\nI can gather, IC is likely to be \u00a323 million worse off after the capital expenditure cuts in\nNovember. Lets say that 1500\nstudents start each year (I'm making up numbers as I go along,\nbecause it's getting rather late on\nThursday). If you charge them\n\u00a3300 each, you get \u00a3450,000,\nwhich doesn't exactly make up\nthe deficit. Fach Imperial undergraduate would have to pay\ntwice that much every year they\nwere here, if last year's budget\ncuts alone are to be compensated\nfor. That's even before we've\nconsidered the financial repercussions on continued grant\nfreezes, and the fact that the\ngovernment is making a sizeable\nloss out of the still un privatised student loans company.\nICU on the record This month, ICU is on a publicity drive to try and gauge student\nresponse to the services and\nfacilities it offers, the idea being\nthat you write to Felix and make\ncomments about what's on offer.\nIn a couple of weeks, the line\nmanagers will take over the letters page and explain them-selves. ICU gets given a fair bit\nof money just to be there and\nkeep us happy, so if it isn't then\nwe should probably be asking\nwhy.\nPersonally, I would like to\nask someone why the sound system and the TV in Da Vinci's are\nalways on at the same time, giving the slightly disconcerting\neffect of watching Sky Sports\npresenters mouth the words to\nMeatloaf.\nEDITORIAL TEAM: NEWS: ALEX FEAKES FEATURES: MARK BAKER\nMUSIC: VIK BANS AL CINEMA: WEI LEE\nARTS: JEREMY PHOTOGRAPHY: DIANA HARRISON AND WILLIAM LORENZ THEATRE: KATHERINE FISH WICK PUZZLES: CATFISH BOOKS: WILLIAM LORENZ SCIENCE: BEN WILKINS COLLATING LAST WEEK: TIM, MARK AND ALEX DELIVERIES: MARK "

    "content": "six . FELIX FRIDAY FEBRUARY 2ND1996 FEATURE\nChristopher Priest Back in 1983, Chris Priest was on the list of \"Best of Young British Novelists\". It should be noted that by\nthen he had ceased to write what is obviously called science fiction, and hence was more acceptable to the\nliterary establishment.\nHis early works of Inverted World, a story set on an infinite hyperbolic world in a finite universe, and\nA Dream of Wessex, exploring the virtual reality of a potential future Utopia, where part of the British new-wave of the 70s. He has cited HG Wells as an influence, and this can be seen in The Space Machine, a pastiche on a mixture of The Time Machine and War of the Worlds, as well as in both The Glamour and The\nPrestige.\nThe Prestige, his latest novel, is the story of a feud between two Victorian magicians, each trying to\ndiscredit the others illusions. The novel itself creates an illusion, using several different diaries to tell the\nsame story from different angles, so that even when all is told the truth is ambiguous. His talk will be on\nthe research into stage illusions that he undertook for the novel.\nPico con13 Picocon is ics f's annual one day science fiction convention. Each year we organise a programme of speak-ers, panels and discussions centred around the themes of SF This years speakers are three of the best\nBritish SF writers around today, namely Stephen Baxter, Robert Holdstock and-Christopher Priest. Each\nwill be giving an individual talk, and will also be on a panel entitled \"The Dangers of Being Pigeonholed\"discussing the pros and cons of any given work being categorised under the SF genre.\nAs well as other panels and discussions on the themes of the X files, vampires, shared universes and\nthe state of fandom. On the less cerebral side, there will be physical games such as Live Lemmings, and\nad-hoc reading of plays from old favourites of the TV and radio. There will also be a dealers room of books,\ncomics and Hitch Hikers Guide paraphernalia.\nTo put your mind to rest concerning your sustenance throughout the day, Da Vinci's will be open: the\nfood side from noon until 2pm, the bar from noon until 6pm. Robert Hold stock Although his early work was mainstream science fiction, it is for his dark woody fantasy novels to which he progressed that he is best known.\nStarting with Mythago Wood, and continued in several other novels, these explore the idea ol a persons own subconscious triggering the re-emergence of mythological characters from the past. This phenomenon is enabled in an ancient piece ol primary lore st, and the characters\nbrought lor ward by the modern day visitors are not necessarily as benevolent as folk legend implies.\nHoldstock is actually a very prolific author in the pure volume of\nhis work, but due to his extensive use ol pseudonyms it is not all that\nobvious. For example, he is the author of Elite, the novel based on the\ncomputer game of the same name, and has written scripts for TV and\nradio. His new novel, Ancient Echoes - a retelling of the Gilgamesh\nmyth, will be out in May.\nStephen Baxter Stephen Baxter first became known to British SF readers through\nhis short stories in Interzone and other magazines. Much of this\nfiction was set in his Xeelee sequence, an imaginative and vividly\ndepicted future history that put many in mind of the works of\nLarry Niven. His first novel, Raft, cemented his growing re put a tion; the description of the life of human refugees thrust into a universe where gravity is a force ten million times stronger than in\nour own is a hard-sf tour de force justly compared with Tau Zero\nand Mission to Gravity.\nHis subsequent output has maintained it's quality but also\nincreased its breadth. As well as further Xeelee stories and novels,\nhe has written SF-Victoriana, alternate history and most recently a highly acclaimed sequel to HG Wells' The Time Machine, The\nTime Ships.\nHis talk will be on HG Wells time at Imperial, and how it\naffected his writing of his fiction.\nIt is not true that the map of freedom will be complete\nwith the erasure of the last invidious border\nwhen it remains for us to chart the attractor s of thunder\nand delineate the arrhythmia s of drought\nto reveal the molecular dialects of forest and savannas vann as rich as a thousand human tongues\nand to comprehend the deepest history of our passions\nancient beyond mythology's reach\nSo I declare that no corporation holds a monopoly on numbers\nno patent can encompass zero and one\nno nation has sovereignty over adenine and guanine\nno empire rules the quantum waves\nAnd there must be room for all at the celebration of\nunderstanding\nfor there is truth which cannot be bought or sold\nimposed by force, resisted\nor escaped.\nFrom Technoliberation by Muteba Kazadi, 2019\nFrom Australian (and hence too expensive to fly to Picocon) author\nGreg Egan's novel Distress, Millenium I995 "

    "content": "Out Here Imperial Queers, Imperial College Union, Prince Consort Road, London SW7\nEditorial\nAshley Lumsden, President IQ - Imperial Queers\nWhen people ask me why we\nneed a gay soc at Imperial, I wonder\nwhy they shouldn't be asking when\nwon't Imperial need one. We all need\nto feel part of a community. Whether\nthat be the academic community of a department's common room, or some\nof the societies that have been\npromoting themselves this SCC\nWeek, it is this feeling of needing to\nbelong that is so important. Lesbians,\ngay men and bisexual people are no\nexception to this. The important\nquestion to consider is why this\nminority do not feel that they belong\nand why it needs a separate society.\nRight now, Imperial is\nchanging its outlook. There are to be\nmore students and an even wider\nrange of studies in the one place. It is\nalso becoming more relaxed with\nitself. Having seen these changes over\nthe past few years, I feel sure that this\nline of change is going set continue -provided that the people here continue\nto think! It is only by question those\nattitudes that have given IC a poor\nreputation in the minds of gay people\nthat progress can be made.\nOut Here has been written\nwith that in mind. It is designed to\nlook at some issues in a different way\n- from the inside so to speak. I hope\nyou will take this opportunity to read\nthem and to question them. Then we\nwill have a new improved Imperial.\nBritain's most famous celibate? A successful actor,\n[ct gf j ft g^t comedian, playwright and novelist keeping up the\npF Oxbridge appearance. SF was spotted last year\nwandering lost in the streets of Brugge after going\nAWOL from London's West End.\n<Fry\nWhy IC Needs IQ\nWhy does Imperial College need a society especially for\ngay people? What really happens at the meetings. Paul\nRagan writes from a personal point of view about what\nIQ has meant to him.\nIt takes a lot of courage to\naccept your sexuality in the face of\nrelentless homophobia, and it took\nme many years until I realised for\nsure that 1 was gay.\nIn many respects I am lucky, because I have\nbeen 'out' to my family\nand some friends for\nabout a year. Coming to\nLondon was, at first, difficult, since I had to leave\nfriends behind, but things\ncan improve quickly, the more people you meet.\nMost of my new friends here\nare not gay (as far as I know), but\nthey don't know that I am gay. In\nfact, I have yet to tell any straight\nfriends; I have decided that, if they\nask me, I 'll tell them. If they don't,I won't. The important thing is not\nto deny your feelings or hide away\nyour sexuality, which is a totally\nnatural part of anyone's personal-it y, whether homosexual or he t ero sexual.\nMyfirst impressions of Imperial\nwere quite positive: the huge diversity of students of different cultures\nand languages for example, the different clubs and societies with something to offer everyone and the\nstudent facilities in the Union.\nSocially, Imperial is fairly well balanced and there is lots going on all\nthe time. The only major problem\nis the ratio of male:female. As a gay\nstudent, though, you can feel quite\nA visit by\nan out gay\nMP like\nChris Smith\nisolated in any environment, when\nyou don't know how to meet other\ngay students. It's great to be able to\ngo along to a group and feel free to\nsay what you like, have a laugh and\ntalk about things you normally wouldn't ever get\nthe chance to say. It's an\nopportunity to make\nfriends, and generally enjoy yourself. That's basically what groups like IQ\nare there for. Even if\nyou're unsure of your sexual orientation, it's still a chance to talk,\ninstead of bottling up those feelings\ninside!\nPersonally, I 've been going to\nIQfor about 3 or 4 months. People\nare very friendly (well, I am anyway!) and there is\nnormally some event or\nother each week (check\nout the web pages, the\nlistings in the back of\nFelix and posters). Sometimes it's just a 'social', to chat with\nfriends and make new ones. Otherwise, there might be a visit by an\nout-gay MP (like Chris Smith, or ex-MP Matthew Parris), or someone\nfrom a gay organisation or pressure\ngroup (like Stonewall). I 've met a few good friends there, and we often\ngo to gay cafes (like First Out) and\nI sometimes also go to other groups\nin London - there are coming out\ngroups (like Turning Point), and\nother social groups like the UL U Turii\n>us for his work on the Enigma Code\n\\g the second world war, Turing is\nas one of the most important founders\noder n computing methods. He was\nis one d in the early 50s and suffered\n\u2022\no therapy for being gay. Had this\ne ned10 years earlier who knows what\nd have resulted.\nHas TV Changed The\nImage of Lesbians?\nWhat is your typical image\nof a lesbian? OK we're stepping\nonto the unwanted territory of stereotypes and non-PC character is at ions, but nevertheless, there must\nbe one.\nRecently, there have been\na lot of examples of so called\n\"lipstick lesbians\" on TV and\npress. All the major soaps have\nhad them and the tabloid press\nhas had a field day, especially with\nthe \"lesbian chic\" phrase that\noccurred around last year.\nI decided to find out what\nthe image of a typical lesbian was\nat IC and whether the media had\ninfluenced opinions on it. Furthermore, had the view of the media of\nlesbians as either a) ultra-f emi nine, made-up, skirt wearing things\nor b) ultra-butch, shaved headed\nthings infiltrated the opinion of the\npeople I spoke to?\nThe response varied from\n\"well they've got shaved heads\nand behave like men and are ugly\n- sorry Karen\" to an attitude that\nlesbians were just ordinary people\nwith 50% slightly feminine and 50%\nFed up with\ngoing to the bar\nwith straight\nfriend i GaySoc. The main thing is that you\ncan feel more at ease with your\nsexuality in London than practically anywhere else. Coming out to\nfriends is the next step, but that's less important than feeling comfortable yourself with your own sexual-it y. So, if you're like me and fed up\nwith going to the union bar with\n'straight' friends or just want to be\namong people you identify with,\nthen come to IQ. Yes,\nI was nervous at first -everyone is, but that\npasses quickly. There\nare problems bein g gay\nhere, which applies to\nsociety generally -there's bigotry and prejudice, which\ncan make you depressed and angry.\nThat's why you need to feel confident about your sexuality and be\nable to cope with the cruelty and\nstupidity of lots of people. Whether\nyou're gay, lesbian, bi or unsure, I think it's an important first step to\nfind out more about how life could\nbe, to realise that there are others\nlike you and to be what you want to\nbe, not what other people expect\nyou to be.\n's: slightly not. Interestingly, both\nthese views were obtained from\nTV, the first person though, never\nwatched soaps and the like.\nI also got told things like,\n\"there isn'ta stereotype, it depends on those that you know are\ngay, erm, and if there is a stereotype, no the media doesn't affect\nit much or perhaps it does.\"\nThe publication of Out Here\nhas allowed me, for the first time\nreally to find out whether other\npeople started off with , or still\nhave, these preconceived ideas\nwith which the media feed us. Sure\nenough, such ideas have surfaced.\nAttitudes have varied from the stereotypical to the diplomatic, but on\nthe whole it seemed that the whole\nthing about image is really an appearance thing, most people I asked plumped for the butch type\nimage because, as one person\npointed out, it is easier to spot than\nfemininity.\nI suppose therefore that the\nmedia has not succeeded in changing people's underlying feelings\nabout lesbians in society by its\ninsistence on the lipstick-lesbian\nsoap stars. Does it matter how\nmany Beth Jordache's you have\nwhen - let's face it - she was used\nas a non-threatening character attractive to both sexes? Normality\nwill perhaps be recognised for all\nelements of society, but not for a while yet, Forthe moment if you are\na developing lesbian take your pick:\nwould you rather be a Madonna or\nak. d. lang?\nSandi HioksviQ\nMuch loved in her role\nin\"No.73\",SThasgone\nfrom strength to\nstrength with a successful writing and stage\ncareer.

    "content": "FEATURE FELIX FRIDAY 2 ND FEBRUARY 1 9 9 6 . FIVE\nFew people will have forgotten the moment when they saw the Space Shuttle\nChallenger cat as to phi call y explode, killing all seven of its crew. It was a shocking moment. It was ten years ago last Tuesday.\nll was tragic to lose seven lives, but for NASA,\nthe accident caused further problems, delaying\ntheir space program by at least three years and\npermanently (hanging the public's attitude\ntowards manned space flight.\nTwo days alter the accident William\nGraham, the head of NASA, set up a committee\nto investigate what went wrong with the shuttle.\nThe commission, which included Neil\nArmstrong, Sally Ride and the Physicist Richard\nFeynman, found that there was a failure in the\nseals between the joints which held the solid\nrocket boosters together.\nDuring the launch, two solid-fuel rockets\nboost the shuttle lor a lew minutes before they\nseparate from the shuttle and fall back into the\nsea. The boosters are made in sections and the\njoints between these sections are sealed before\neach flight. The joints arc sealed by two rubber\nO rings, which are approximately a quarter of an\ninch thick and lie on a circle 12 feet in diameter. PropsiSaot\nWhen t!n ese seals were originally designed by A solid rocket booster joint. If the primary O ring gets\nthe Morton Thiokol Company, it was expected\nthat the pressure from the burning fuel would\nsquash the O rings. But because the joint is thicker than the walls of the rocket, the walls bow outward during launch causing the gap between the\njoint to expand (this problem was discovered very\nearly, before they ever Hew the shuttle). To\nmaintain the seal, the rubber has to expand fast\nenough to close the gap, so the springiness of the\nrubber was an essential part ol the design. The\nThiokol engineers went to the company who\nmanufactured the rubber, but they said that their\nO rings are not meant to be used that way, so\nthey could give no advice. Several makeshift\nimprovements were made to the design, but the\njoints still leaked, causing the O rings to burn in\nplaces.\nUp until the Challenger flight, there was a history ol 'O ring incidents'. This problem was\ndiscussed in NASA's \"Ilight readiness reviews\"\nhut there1 appears to have been some self contradiction in the recommendations (see\nRecommendations, below right).II the problem is\n\"most critical\", how could it also he \"sale to continue living?\"\nDuring the investigation, an engineer Irom\nThiokol revealed that on the night before the\nlaunch, they had loi d NASA the shuttle should-n't Fly il the temperature\nwas he low53 degrees\n(temperature is important\nbecause the colder the\nrubber seals are, the less\nspringy they are). The\ntemperature on the morn-burnt, flames can exit through the test port.\ning of the flight was 29 degrees. It seems pressure\nwas put on Thiokol to launch, even though at\nleast two of their seal experts were against it.\nThis is not the whole story of what caused\nthe Challenger accident, but it does make clear\nthat there were failures in both the engineering of\nthe shuttle and in management. Most aeroplanes\nare designed \"Irom the bottom up\" meaning that\nall the components have already been extensively\ntested. One criticism of the shuttle is that it was\ndesigned from \"the top down\" (to save time).\nWhenever a problem is discovered, a lot of\n'makeshift' redesigning was required to fix it.\nThis is what happened with the seals.\nNow matter how many safety features are\nbuilt into a rocket, space flight will always be a very risky business. You will always need a huge\namount of fuel to get into orbit. Should we be\nsending astro naughts into space at all? Figures\nvary wildly, but most estimates put the chances\nof a shuttle launch going catastrophically wrong at\naround one in one hundred. If this figure is cor-rect, we can expect another accident within the\nnext fifty years or so.\nChallenger had on board a school teacher,\nMrs McAuliffe. This signalled the start of space\nflight being available to anyone - not just\nastro naughts. Since then attitudes have changed.\nWhilst some work in space can only be done by\nhumans, there are good arguments for concentrating our efforts on unmanned missions.\nJ^^^ H|| Sending up manned spacecraft requires every\n. :\n\u2022\n. Ii',[ IT tiI:!' IS systems, and all manner ol redundancy. The\nresult is an inordinate amount ol testing and\nA tell-tale flame coming from the test port on the solid expense. The shuttle lor instance has tour ident i rocket booster, just before the shuttle exploded. e al computers all running the same program just\nin case the other three should all happen to fail at\n..,\u00ab\u201e, the same time. There is also a fifth backup com-/ \\ \\ / Of iii\"\\ put er on a separate circuit - it has never been\nused.\nHumans can also cause problems with\nexperiments in space. Their movement jogs apparatus which should not be disturbed and introduces dust and moisture into the environment.\nThe manned \"International Space Station\" is due\nlor launch in 1998. But at an estimated cost of\nTwo examples of O ring erosion.

They are not only responsible for producing supreme house music, but also for mixing a great many tracks by famous artists such as Bjork\nand Julio Iglesias (although why anyone would\nwant to shout about working with that sad old\nman is anybody's guess). Here, in his solo capacity as The Bucketheads, Kenny has produced an\nalbum of good, but not truly great dance music.\nYou're probably thinking that you couldn't bear to sit and listen to an hour of rehashed '70s disco tracks. I would agree, but if you listen to this\nalbum then you won't have to. The two singles\ndo stand out like Pavarotti at a weight-watchers'\nmeeting ('Got Myself Together' clocks in at just\nover eight minutes, but thankfully we are only\nsubjected to an edit of The Bomb' rather than it's full fourteen minutes), but the rest of the album\nis a pleasant mix of jazz, funk and great drum\nbeats, utilising some old tracks by artists as diverse\nas Chicago and Level 42. Indeed, one of the highlights is the bliss ed out Time and Space' that uses\nthe Level 42 tune, 'Starchild'.\nThis is a good album then, and one which has\nfar surpassed my expectations. It is not jam-packed with house anthems or many future single\nreleases, but it is ideal background music since it\nallows you to enjoy it without you having to pay it\ntoo much attention.

Visible amounts of blood, semen or\nvaginal secretions are enough.\nQuality: The virus must be healthy and\nactive to infect, it deteriorates rapidly outside the\nbody.\nRoute: HIV must enter directly into the\nblood stream in sufficient quantity and quality\nfor transmission to occur, i.e. from one protected\nenvironment to another. This is why sharing\ninjecting equipment (needles, barrels etc.) is an\neasy way for HIV to infect people. The virus can\npass from bloodstream to bloodstream without\nbeing exposed to a harsh environment. Similarly,\nunprotected vaginal or anal sex involves body\nfluids in sufficient quantity, the quality of the\nvirus is good and it can pass straight from one\nwarm body to another. A route of transmission\nis possible through small tears in the skin or\nmembranes around the sexual organs. This applies\nequally to sex with men or women. HIV does not\ndiscriminate between a persons sexual\norientation. At present the gay community is\nbetter educated than the straight community\nand statistics show the latter are more at risk\nthan the former.\nWhat about condoms? Condoms offer\neffective protection against HIV (and other\nsexually transmitted diseases) when you have\nvaginal or anal intercourse. They stop the\nexchange of body fluids so there is no route for\ninfection. Extra strong condoms are essential for\nsafer anal sex along with plenty of water based\nlubricant such as KY Jelly, Wet Stuff or Liquid\nSilk (oil based lubes like vase line rot rubber and\ndestroy condoms). Remember to follow the\ninstructions and use and dispose of condoms\nproperly so they can act as an effective barrier.\nWhat about risks? We know the risk of\nHIV transmission through oral sex is very low.\nRemember, saliva makes the quality of the virus\npoor, a healthy mouth and throat acts as a barrier and stomach acids kill the virus. Some\npeople prefer to use a condom for oral sex,\nflavoured ones are available. Touching, kissing\nand DIY are all safe as is any other kind of sex\nthat does not involve the body fluids mentioned\ngetting into your bloodstream.\nSafer sex isn't just about putting on a condom: relationships, talking to each other\nabout what you want and feeling good about\nyourself are also important.\nWhatever you do, have\nfun and be careful.\nTHE PINK PAPER IS\nDELIVERED TO THE\nSTUDENT UNION OFFICE\nEVERY THURSDAY.

Andy\nMcClure, departmental representative for Electrical and\nElectronic Engineering, voiced\nconcerns after final year students\nwere compelled to adapt to the\nnew equipment in time for their\nrecent round of finals.\nVernon McClure (no rel a tion) said University of London\nrules about 'compromising the\nintegrity of exams' and the\n'excessive sophistication' of\nsome models affected the level\nplaying field of exams. He said\nthat students were having problems using different machines.\nHowever, Mr McClure regretted\nthat the decision was made so\nquickly: students haven't been\nable to take advantage of the\nfinancial saving a bulk order\nwould have given. Sarah White,\nICU President, said that ICU bookstore will stock the new cal-cul at or, though at a slightly higher price than Union had originally wanted.\nThe Pro-Rector for\nEducational Quality, Professor\nAlan Swanson, said that it was\nassumed that students may not\nwant to downgrade by buying\ntheir aw n basic calculator and\nwould instead choose to practice\nwith the ones provided for the\npurpose by their departments.\nIC consider charging 'entrance fee'\nBY ANDY SINHARAY AND\nALEX FEAKES\nImperial College's official line on\ntop-up fees was outlined by\nProfessor Swanson, Pro-Rector\nfor Educational Quality, at\nWednesday's Academic Affairs\nmeeting.\nThe College has been looking\ninto the possibility of charging\ntop-up fees in view of the recent\nGovernment cuts, and had been\nlooking specifically at two ways\nof charging the fee.\nFirstly, a straight 'signing on\nfee' might be charged, whereby\npeople would pay a one-off\namount of approximately \u00a3300\nwhen they io in Imperial College.\nSecondly, a top-up fee proper\ncould be introduced. This would\nbe in line with what many other\nUniversities are contemplating,\nand would involve students being\ncharged for each year of their\nstudy. However, neither has been\nagreed for certain.\nProfessor Swanson stressed\nthat the Rector was not keen to\ninitiate either scheme, though\nthe Committee for ViceChancellors and Principals\n(CVCP) is meeting today to discuss the issue. He felt that key\ndecisions about higher education\nfunding have been thrust upon\nthem and that \"the Government\n[is] getting other people to do\ntheir dirty work.\" Some representatives on the CVC P have\nsuggested that they might threaten to introduce top-up fees in\nMay for political reasons.\nProfessor Swanson went on\nto say that \"the squeeze would\ncontinue\", and the level of any\nfee would be set by the governing\nbody, subject to provision for\npoorer students. When pressed\nabout the subject of a subsidy for\nthe less well-off, Professor\nSwanson replied that a US style\nsystem may have to be adopted.\nIn American colleges, the financial status of students plays no\npart in the selection process.\nStudents are selected on academic merit only, and fee levels are\nset so that rich students essentially sub sid is e the poorer ones.\nc \u00a3o A j&y/ to Am j/ ku a& and ki&&e&p vat w Snookums/to/\nb luffy* ll%UAmAjton&/'\nVC S.It's that time of year again.

    "content": "sp\nFELIX The student newspaper of\nImperial College\nIssue 1048\nFebruary 2nd1996 Fire services face funds cut\nBY MIKE INGRAM\nFire cover around Imperial\nCollege and all over London is in\njeopardy this week because of\ninsufficient Government fund-ing. Proposals from the London\nFire and Civil Defence Authority\n(LFCDA) could slash resources\nat Fulham fire station by one fire\nengine and 24 staff.\nFulham, along with the\nKensington and Chelsea station,\nprovides the major fire cover for\nthe College and surrounding\nareas. If the proposals are implemented, the station will have\nstaff levels reduced from 53 to\n29. This means that only one fire\ncrew would be on duty at any one\ntime, with support crews having\nto come from Kensington and\nChelsea. According to one of fi cer, this would \"leave fire cover\ndangerously low... if there are\ntwo incidents at the same time, it\ncould be a disaster.\"\nThe LFC DA plans to close\nfour fire stations in Greater\nLondon, remove one fire engine\nfrom 22 others, and lay off a total\nof around 650 firefighters. The\nmeasures are forced because the\ngovernment has set its budget\nfor 1996/97 at \u00a3253 million,\nwith an upper limit on spending\nof \u00a3259.2 million. The LF DC A is\nappealing against the cuts, saying\nPHOTO: ALEX FEAKES\nAnother fire-and-rescue call at the Fire Station on Kensington High\nStreet: the cuts could mean that emergency response times will fail\nto meet Government minimums.\nthat it needs a minimum of\n\u00a3268.5 million \"just to stand\nstill\".\nThe four stations faced with\nclosure include London's oldest\nstation, at Manchester Square.\nThe station, a listed building,\ncovers much of the West End,\nincluding several hospitals and\nthe area surrounding Oxford\nStreet. A campaign to oppose its\nclosure has been set up with supporters including the University\nof Westminster and Madame\nTussaud's. Fire Brigade officers\nhave warned that the loss of such\na crucial station in central\nLondon would make it extremely\ndifficult to get to the scene of all\nfires within the five minute target set by the Home Office.\nThe proposals are also facing\nfierce opposition from firefight-ers' unions, MPs, businesses and\nthe general public. A representative of the Fire Brigades Union\ntold Felix: \"Make no mistake. If\nany of these cuts take place lives\nwill be lost. That goes without\nsaying.\" Firefighters from all over\nLondon have been organising\npetitions against the cuts, collecting tens of thousands of signatures. The final decision on cuts\nContinued on page two\nGovernment\nsay no to fees\nBY DIPAK GHOSH\nThe Government has expressed\nstrong opposition to the introduction of top-up fees. It has\nadvised the Committee of Vice\nChancellors and Principals\n(CVCP) to consider the consequences very carefully on before\ntaking any decision on the issue.\nThis warning comes shortly\nbefore the CVC P meet on\nFriday to discuss how to claw\nback the cuts in higher education funding. The Government\nmay instead push vice-chancel-lor s to consider cuts in student\nintake. In a document published\nlast year, the Higher Education\nFunding Council for England\ngave permission for institutions\nto take less than their contracted\nstudent numbers. The funding\ncouncil said this week that the\nreduction in student intake has\nbeen left \"deliberately open\".\nThey also warned that institutions which chose to reduce\nstudents below the lower level\nwould be subject to having some\nof their funding withdrawn. If a large number of institutions\ndecide to make drastic cuts, the\nthe funding council would have\nContinued on page 3\nSabbatical elections '96\nPapers go up on Monday for\nnext year's ICU sabbatical elections.

As\nthey ambled on\nstage, I thought to\nmyself) \"It's going to I be shout y\". Thankfully, the reality was that the\nband only lightly slapped us in the face with some\nfinely crafted tunes.\nThey managed a convincing performance\nwhilst avoiding such potential disasters as a cellist\njoining them on stage. Only The Auteurs usually\nget away with that sort of thing, but it worked for\nDrugstore too. There is obviously a tune smith at\nwork here. There are riffs that you won't forget\nquickly and that are easily hum mable and, as they\nsoared above the crowd, I began to think that this\nlot could get somewhere.\nEnergy and enthusiasm abound from the\nsinger, who is all wide-eyed and happy, and\ntowards the end of the gig the subdued gig-goers\nappear to actually start enjoying themselves with\nthat strange 'sway' that afflicts those who stand\ntowards the back and attempt to dance.\nI enjoyed Drugstore's performance although\ntheir songs do lack the energy for a really good gig.\nYou could say that their zero moshi ng material\nmeans they are probably suited more to wallpaper\nthan wildness.\nI like Teenage Fanclub. In fact, I more than\njust like diem - I think that they're smashing.\nTonight, the Fannies have to work for their money.\nAfter being assaulted by the absolute dross of The\nFlaming Dps, the crowd are initially just al it de un receptive. The band admit to the crowd, after\nsome bizarre tangential reference to slippers, that\nthey haven't played for a month, and ask whether\nit shows. Does it heck. Massive enthusiasm, big\ntalent and material from all of their LPs combine\nto produce an energetic and thrilling spectacle.\nIt takes about seven songs to get the whole of\nthe crowd going but 'The Cabbage' soon sorts\nthem out. 'Neil Jung' then sees the kids going wild\nand into the major crowd-surfing zone.\nVerisimilitude', 'Mellow doubt' and 'Sparky's dream' round off the set and Norman ruins the\nencore by saying that the\nband will come\nback anyway.\nThankfully, the\nbest is saved 'til\nlast with one of\nthe finest debut\nsingles ever,\n' Everything flows'. The set\nfinishes with Norman going completely bonkers\nand cutting all the strings off the band's guitars\nwith a pair of pliers. Then, in best anti-rock rn' roll\nstyle, the boys carefully lay down their guitars and\nwander off - no Fannying about.\n-album: tortoise - millions\nnow living will never die limA tricky one for me to describe, this. It's guitar-based, which makes a change, but it's on a mellow\ntrip moving towards psychedelia in places. It lies\nsomewhere between the Ozric Tentacles and\nStereolab (they share the latter's producer) and is\nthe sort of music that could inspire you to men-tion, well, erm... sonic cathedrals really.\nThere are only six tracks on this promo copy.\nThey do last for a full forty-five minutes but they\ntend to merge into one another after a while. This\nis not exactly uplifting music and is probably an\nacquired taste. It worked well lor me on a boring\nSunday night in, but it did grate slightly at other\ntimes, especially the bit that sounds like the c.d. is\njumping (it caught me out twice).\nNevertheless, if experimental '90s prog rock\ntickles your fancy, then this one is for you.(6) album: frank black -the cult of ray\u2122\nYipe, it's Frank Black - former lead cJ Bf the\nPixies, fon ner King Of Indie Rock and me foster\nparent to those not so well known Seattle bands\nlike Nirvana.

    "content": "ELECTION SPECIAL FELIX FRIDAY 2 ND FEBRUARY 1 9 9 6 . TWENTY-ONE\nSAB BAT ICAL EL EOT IONS OK, Listen up! If you want to become an ICU Sabbatical then follow these\nn struct ions: Read the job descriptions on this page. Then sign the nomination\npapers which will be displayed on the ICU noticeboard, opposite the Union\noffice, from Monday 5th Feb - Friday 16th Feb. You'll need one person to\nnominate you and twenty others to second you. Then comes the hard part -you have to convince people to vote for you!\nMixEd it or& Print Unit Manager\nFor some reason, this sabbatical position ended up as two jobs instead of one,\nbut since I reckon I get to have a lot more fun than the other three, perhaps\nit's worth not being able to do anything else with your life.\nThe print unit manager bit involves running the Union's in-house printing\nfacilities. That means being responsible for a trading outlet with a fairly sizeable turnover: working with ICU's professional printer, you do everything from\nVAT returns to rolling up your sleeves and working with greasy bits of equipment (!). Oh, and you get to do lots of photocopying as well.\nContrary to what many seem to think, editing Felix does not mean you\nwrite the entire paper: it's about managing a team of people for whom Felix is\ntheir big extra-curricular activity, so you have to be prepared to 'work' most\nweekday evenings. More than anything else, you need to be a person who can\ninspire and encourage as many people as possible to contribute, because\nyou're certainly not going to have time to do it all yourself. And quite frankly,\nit would be a whole lot worse if you did. There's no reason at all why you should\nbe currently involved in Felix, but a good knowledge of desk-top publishing (we\nuse QuarkXPress) is essential.\nSo somehow you get an issue out every Friday (which is more often than\npractically any other student newspaper in the country, so don't underestimate\nthe size of the task). And you get a unreasonable amount of complaints and\ncriticism for it, and probably feel you're doing a thoroughly de moral ising thankless task. But there's something quite satisfying about returning an hour later\nto that pile of 600 newspapers you left out, to discover that there are none\nleft. Rachel Walters\nDeputy President( Clubs & Societies)\nAre you going to be the lucky (?) one? If you are thinking of something challenging to do for the next 13 months then have you thought about being a sab-bat ical? Deputy President (C&S) is a challenging and fulfilling role to a ke up in\nthe Union. If elected, you will be responsible for the following:\nOrganising BUSA sports; organising the Freshers' Fair; representing sports\nand societies to Colleg, ULU, and other outside organisations; sorting out\ninsurance payments; temporary membership; overseeing all the Clubs &\nSocieties; internal room bookings; Union keys; notice boards and poster regulations; e mail accounts; WWW pages.\nYou will also have to attend: Disciplinary meetings, Exec, Council, SubCommittee meetings, ULU sports meetings, Refectory Services and Bookstore\nmeetings, Union Finance Committee, College Athletics Committee, South\nKensington Users Group, BUSA meetings, College Disciplinary meetings, ULU\nGUC, BUSA conferences, ULU training and'ICU training (p hew!). On top of that you will be part of a team who look after the day to day\nmanagement of the Union. Teamwork is essential in this job if your year in the\nUnion is going to be successful. You will find yourself mucking in around the\noffice, helping out with carnivals, reception and helping in a multitude of other\nincidents.\nSo now you know what goes into the job, why don't you run in the elections and have an interesting and stressful year. Tim Townend\nPresident Why on earth would anyone in their right mind want to do this job? It's highly\nstressful, poorly paid, the hours are long and you will exist in a state of permanent confusion for about 13 months. On the other hand, it's great fun, you\nget to meet a huge range of people and it's an experience I wouldn't have\nmissed for the world.\nAs President you represent students to College and to the outside world.\nThis involves sitting on committees arguing the student case and pressing for\nthe best possible facilities for ICU. These committees total about 40 within\nCollege, ICU and ULU, with unlimited numbers of outside committees and\nworking parties. This means that one of the most important aspects of the job\nis the ability to be able to work with staff and students from College and a huge\nrange of other institutions.\nThe President is also responsible for everything that goes on in the Union,\nalthough much of this is delegated to the two Deputy Presidents. This ranges\nfrom discipline and staffing to running the elections. Much of the job involves\nacademic affairs and welfare, and students and staff may ask you to raise\nissues at various levels, or just come to you for advice and guidance. You will\noften be called in to help with cases at University level, and could find yourself\neither representing one of our students at an Academic Tribunal, or sat on the\nother side of the table on the judicial panel.\nWe've tried hard to improve links with other student unions this year,\nespecially those within ULU. The support which Sabbs in ULU give each other\nhas been invaluable to me. You need to work with them to understand that\nthere are a far wider range of issues for students than those which may appear\nin your year here and that we all need to work together to tackle them. Some\nof the most interesting and important things I 've done this year have been with\ngroups from institutions all over the country.\nAs you may have guessed by now, one of the worst points about this job\nis every now and then, having to explain to people what exactly it is you do.\nI'm still not entirely sure, but if you are interested in running, please, please\ncome and see me with any questions. The things I 've mentioned above are\nreally just the tip of the iceberg, and although there are many things you have\nto do the job is what you make it. Running last year was probably the best decision I 've ever made - it's a chance you'll never get again, so don't be scared.\nSarah White\nDeputy President( Finance & Services!\nSo, you want to be a Sabb? Have you seen your psychiatrist about this? Well,\nwhile (s) he's working out the cause of the problem, I might as well tell you\nwhat you'd be letting yourself in for.\nBeing DP(F&S) is a bit like climbing a steep, muddy slope with your legs\ntied together. It's all about high finance, top-level decision making, teamwork,\norganisation, and ritual abuse (verbal, that is).\nYou get to be held responsible for the well-being of two million quid. You\nget to organise the Union Finance Committee, where everyone shouts at each\nother in a desperate bid to get money. This is your chance to sort out clubs'\n& societies' finance questions for them, and authorise every bit of expenditure\nover \u00a3500.\nThe bars, catering, entertainments and bookstore will be your babies to\noversee through the Refectory Services, Entertainments and Bookstore\nCommittees, all of which you will organise and run. A fleet of minibuses, games\nmachines and food machines will be your footstool.\nThe many meetings you end up attending, far too numerous to list here,\nwill leave you with a pain in the diodes down your left side. You will find yourself thrust to the very forefront of the Union's interaction with college as you\nrepresent the students as part of the sabbatical team. Many a time you will\nland up sitting in a hall of residence grilling candidates for the job of warden\nor sub warden in the accommodation side of your work.\nBut it is the teamwork within the sabbatical group that will thrill you and\ntease you the most. You will have to work as a highly organised trio to take the\nUnion one step closer to the new millennium.\nOr something like that. Matt Crompton\n\n"

It started in\n1975 with twelve Mechanical\nEngineering students helping out\nin the Pimlico school on Lupus\nStreet, but has gradually spread\nto include a total of fourteen\nplacement schools in the London\narea, with 130 students involved\neach year.\nNow though, The Pimlico\nConnection want to expand into\nPHOTO: ALEX FEAKES\nThe outgoing co-or d in at or of the Pimlico Connection, Betty Caplan,\ncuts the birthday cake with current chair, Ian Gregory. The party\nbrought together past and present student tutors and some of the\nteachers that they have assisted.\nstudent tutoring in schools, and\nhave brought back lots of useful\nideas for the British scheme.\nFeaturing heavily at this seminar\nwere nationwide organisations,\nsuch as COOL of the USA, and\na whole new area; that of national funding and organisation of\nstudent tutoring. Students Vicki\nWellham and Hester Shaw were\nrecently in Cleveland, Ohio, for\nan international conference on\nIsrael's 'Perach' Organisation.\nWith the financial help of\nsponsors BP, the Pimlico Connection now plan to send these\ntwo students back to the USA for this years assembly, the\nWorld Conference of Student\nCommunity Service in Washington DC. Also, Helen Moglestue and Caroline Goldham are\nto visit the Israeli equivalent, and\nhope is to expand the help they\nnow give British children. One of\nvariations on the theme is that of\nthe Connection's French counterpart's students visit prisons,\nnot only giving educational, but\nmedical and health advice as\nwell.\nHowever, though last year's Pimlico chair's met with Education Minister Gillian Shepherd,\nthere seems to be no Governmental approach to the idea of\nstudent community service.\nUniversity chiefs warn Government over funding crisis\ncontinued from front page\nto refuse. Institutions have until\nFebruary 9th to submit plans for\nnew student numbers to the\nfunding council.\nThe alternative option for\nvice-chancellors is top-up fees.\nThe vice-chancellors reacted with\nsurprise to the Government's statement that the consequences\nof top-up fees would rest with\nthe universities, since Ministers\nhad previously reassured universities that responsibility of\nimposing charges for courses lay\nwith them. The chairman of\nCVC P and head of Sheffield\nUniversity, Gareth Roberts, has\nsaid that a one-off charge at a flat\nrate of between \u00a3I00-\u00a3300 could\nbe levied on students at all universities in the academic year\n1997/1998. He stressed that this\nis a short-term strategy while the\nwhole issue of the future of higher education funding could be\nconsidered. However, it is not\nclear whether it would apply to\nall degree students or only the\nintake in the Autumn, expected\nto be about 500,000.\nLevying the charge would\nhelp universities recoup cuts\nannounced in the November budget statement. It has been estimated that universities are \u00a3550\nmillion short of the income needed to maintain the current ser-vice. Vice-chancellors fear that\nthe cuts are likely to be even\nmore severe because the Government has not yet decided where\nto find the \u00a3100 million from the\n1996/97 accounts due to the\npostponement of student loans\nprivatisation.\nVice-chancellors may consider boycotting inspections of their\nteaching quality, which the\nGovernment requests to assess\nthe standards of teaching.\nAccording to a survey by the\nGuardian, vice-chancellors are\ngenerally opposed to levying\ncharges and boycotting inspections, but there is a general consensus of opinion that some\naction must be taken to register\nopposition to funding cuts.\nDerek Roberts, Provost of\nUniversity College London, said\nthe Government's statement was\n\"totally inadequate\" and the\nwarning indicated that the\nGovernment was \"scared\" of the\nvice-chancellors' actions close to\nan election. He demanded that\nthe Government say what the\nalternatives to top-up fees are.\nProf Roberts has angered his\nstudents by proposing a\" real is tic\" top-up up fee of \u00a31000 per\nyear, a third of which he will use\nto increase academic salaries. \"I am not willing to see the rundown of higher e duca ation in this\ncountry in the same way as secondary education, if you don't believe in fairies, students will\nhave to pay.\"\nHowever, Martin Harris,\nvice-chancellor of Manchester\nUniversity said cutting student\nintakes would not bring in any\nextra money. He told the university' s ruling court that top-up\nfees, combined with a better student loans system, were now the\nonly alternative to irreversible\ndamage. Gillian Shephard, the\nEducation and Employment\nSecretary, had been thought to\nbe in favour of top-up fees as long\nas universities took the responsibility. But a spokesman said\nrecently that \"the Government\nsees no need for top-up fees and\nis concerned they might disadvantage students from less well-off families.\"\nThe Russell group of top uni-vers i ties, which also includes\nImperial College, has come out\nagainst introducing top-up fees.\nSarah White of ICU has said top-up fees are unacceptable as they\nwould be unfair to students who\ncannot pay. However, according\nto a survey by New Solutions, a group of student union officers,\n56% of student reps said that\n\"individuals who experience\npost-16 education\" should contribute towards the cost. A survey of 1,000 students from\naround the country showed that\n53% thought that the taxpayer\nshould pay for tuition costs.\nImperial College's reaction to\ntop-up fees page 4\n\n"

    "content": "AN OPEN LETTER\nTO A FRIEND\nI always used to be slightly innocent on some matters, homophobia being\none of them. I was aware that it existed and I was aware that people had\nbeen very badly hurt by it, but never had I been exposed to it. I think\npart of the problem was that I had been in the closet about my sexuality\nthroughout school and at university until a few months ago. Also, my\nfriends, when I did decide to plunge into the deep unknown and come\nout, were very supportive, it didn't bother them at all and neither did it\nbother my family. I considered myself very fortunate but I felt I needed\nthe experience of coming across a homo ph obe. That is why I have to thank you, you made me realise what people can\nbe like. It is for that reason that I have decided to write this open letter\nto \"Felix\" as I want to discuss further some of the points you raised. Of\ncourse there's always the possibility you were winding me up, but I think\nnot I think the first statement I will have to quote because otherwise I feel that I can't give it the passion and eloquence that it deserves, you\nsaid \"lesbians are OK as long as I don't know any of them but gay men\nshould be shot.\" Ah what a wonderful statement that is, yes after being a lesbian all my life and you having known me for part of that life, I am\nreally going to change just like that because I told you that I was gay.\nAs for your second statement that gay men should be shot, I am\nsurprised that one so dedicated to the \"true nature\" as yourself would\nneed to rely on a gun of all things, I agree, what could be more natural?!\nYou did however raise another very valid point, I am afraid I would do it\njustice if I didn't quote again, \"Homosexuality is unnatural... I only like\nthe 'true nature'.\" What may I ask is the true nature? Another of my\nfriends interjected at this point saying that if we were only concerned\nwith 'true nature' then only trees and things that didn't destroy\nthemselves would be here, well, I mean, how ignorant can you get? Much\nbetter to merely criticises something that happens in many aspects of\nanimal life, not just human and to call it unnatural. After all it was a choice we made wasn't it!\nI once again thank you for trying to guide me to the \"right\" path of\nheterosexuality, I do however find it unfortunate that you will probably\nnot read this as it would frighten you too much even to be caught\nlooking at part of this \"homosexual pull-out section\".\nPerhaps I 'll see you around, or will you avoid me because you now view\nme as a shaved headed, dyke T shirt wearing, lesbian with attitude?\n^lean while, I will continue viewing myself as I am and you as a prat.\nHIV: Facts From Fiction\nNigel Russell is involved in KY Babies - Camden and Islington\nHealth Authority's Peer Education Project.

    "content": "Special Edition for Social Clubs' Week 2 February 1996\nOut Here\nMatthew Parris: The Visit, The Article, The Truth A recent train of events which started with\na visit to a student society, was followed by an\narticle in The Times and finally lead to an open\nletter in The Reporter, the staff newspaper of\nImperial College. What was this about? It\nconcerned the question of whether scientists are\nopen-minded or conformist.\nMatthew Parris came to Imperial on\nNovember 21 as a guest of Imperial Queers - the\nlesbian, gay and bisexual society here at Imperial.\nParris had been an MP in the early eighties, and\nthen moved into writing and broadcasting. He\nhad come to tell IQ how it was being a gay man\nin the Conservative Party, and he went to tell of\nhow he \"came out\" as gay during a speech to the\nHouse.\nHe asked people at the meeting if a college\nconsisting only of scientists could be more\nprejudiced than one with arts students, and he\nthe question was answered in no uncertain terms.\nYes - came the reply, some students were\nparticularly narrow minded. Parris was surprised\nat this and went on to wonder why this was. The\nmeeting concluded that the modern study of\nscience, forces a narrow outlook, where it is\nforbidden to question the fundamentals of the\nfield.\nParris wondered about these questions some\nmore and wrote them down, with his answers in\nhis column in The Times. Under the headline\n\"Learning science ought to foster openness, but\ninstead it seems to result in narrow mindedness\".\nHe wrote \"The role of science in mankind's struggle throughout history against myth and\nprejudice is disgraceful.\" and went on to describe\nthe absence of \"sceptical scientific heads above\nthe parapet\".\nThe first issue of The Reporter in 1996 carried\nan open letter from Professor Mino Green\nMatthew Parris\ncomplaining that Parris' choice of narrow minded\nscientific examples did not prove his argument.\nGreen considered Thomas Huxley with Darwin\nand MIT with McCarthy as examples of open\nscientific minds. He concluded \"Articles like your\nare totally unhelpful, even damaging, and I would ask you to rethink and then rewrite what\nyou have said.\"\nCommenting on the letter Parris replied \"In\nthe words of Pilate, I have said what I have said.\"\nHe went on to comment that the Professor's last\nparagraph was a good example of the attitudes to\nwhich he referred in The Times.\nMartin Morris, who was at the original\nmeeting with Matthew Parris remarked \"He came\nalong with an open mind but his comments were\nmet by closed ones. Perhaps us scientists should\nconsider his words more carefully?\"\nAwareness of Issues\" At All Time High\" Imperial College Union President Sarah\nWhite said last Monday that she was delighted to\nsee gay issues being put on the agenda at\nImperial.\n\"It is obvious that prejudice is slowly disappearing - which is great news, and for that reason\nit is becoming easier to be open about oneself here\na tlC\" Members of IQ - Imperial Queers - agreed\nwith Sarah. Alvin Renton said \"Coming out\ncan be a difficult process which involves looking\nat yourself very closely. Now that there are more\nopen gay men and lesbians on television, people\ncoming out can see that they are not alone and\nthat they have nothing to be ashamed of. This\nimproves chances of meeting other gay people at\nplaces like Imperial.\nCommenting, Ashley Lumsden, President\nof IQ said \"The changing atmosphere on campus\nis only due to the behaviour of the staff and\nstudents here.\n\"We should be proud of the efforts being\nmade that are transforming life, for all people.\nOut Here is part of the process making this\nchange.\"\nComment - centre pages\nThink Pink Why is Out Here on pink coloured\npaper? This is a question that is easily an-s were d. Rnk is a colour that has been associated with gay men since the war. It was Nazi\nGermany that needed to label people physically and as they chose the green star for\nJewish people, so they choose the inverted\npink triangle for homosexuals.\nThis choice might seem rather negative,\nbut infact,for many gay men and women it is\na measure of pride to be able to say \"This is\nwhat I am\" and by using pink triangles they are\nsaying that being gay is no reason for shame or\noppression.\nWhen people here at Imperial wanted to\nname their lesbian, gay and bisexual society,\nthey chose the name Imperial Queers for\nsimilar reasons. Whilst some see \"queer\" as\nan insult, it is a sign of strength to be able to\nsay \"Yes - this is what we are.\"\nLabelling People? Do you recognise gay people here at\nImperial? Fashion-conscious, quiche-eating\nmen? Body-building, car-mending women?\nThese are obvious signs that some people use\nto recognise gay men and women.\nOut Here gives you a chance to develop\nyour own understanding of what it is like to be\ngay at Imperial. Our centre pages will put you\nin the picture about gay men and women. We\nall know gay people around us even if we\ndon't realise it - yet!\nFighting Prejudice: Cons oc meets IQ\nIn a joint meeting earlier this week, IQ\nand Imperial College's Conservative Society, Consoc, debated the subject of homo-phobia.\nThe event, part of the Social Clubs'\nWeek, was the idea of Consoc's Deputy\nChair Geoff Boon who commented \"We\nbelieve the nineties will consign homophobia to the prejudicial dustbin. I hope these\ndiscussions between Consoc and IQ will\npromote tolerance amongst members and\nother students at IC.\" IQ's President Ashley\nLumsden spoke at the meeting saying that\npeople must work to end prejudice.\n\"Prejudice affects many people in complicated ways, but only by talking about our\nfears can we confront it. We must confront\nthose who are homophobic in their views\nwith intelligence and information.\"\nInside: Why IC needs IQ - 2 Pubs and Clubs4 Directory of London Contacts4 "
