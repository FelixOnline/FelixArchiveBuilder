There were\nthree such films: Czech \u2018Kinoautomat\u2019\nMan and His Home (1966), Danish\nSwitching (2003), and Canadian Late\nFragment (2007), movies in which we\ndecide what happens.\nKinoautomat, the first interactive\ncinema and brain child of Czech director Rad\u00faz \u010cin\u010dera was invented in\n1966, which included two moderators\nsitting at the stage alongside the movie\nprojection.Thefirstandonlyfilmmade\nfor Kinoautomat system was Man And\nHis Home (\u2018\u010clov\u011bk a jeho d\u016fm\u2019), which\ncontained within the storyline several\nmoral dilemmas for the main charac-ter, Mr. Novak. Each time Mr. Novak\nwas in a predicament (nine times in\nthe movie) the projection was paused\nand the moderators would come up to\nthe stage and present each side of the\nstory to the audience. The audience\nwas then asked to vote on what Mr Novak should do next; should he go after\nhis angry wife, or stay in the flat with\nhis barely clothed sexy neighbour? In\na special purpose-built cinema hall\nseats had red and green buttons people\ncould press to vote, the movie preceding once the audience voted, with the\nmajority choice being shown.\nThe first screening of Kinoautomat\ntook place in 1967, but the combination of demanding technical issues (to\nenable voting and parallel storylines,\nfive different projectors had to be running at the same time and be switched\nbetween during the screening) and the\ncommunist regime that disliked the\nidea of people voting, even in cinema,\nmeant that the concept of Kinoautomat ended up being forgotten for 40\nyears. Then, in February 2006, Raduz\nCincera\u2019s daughter digitalised the film\nand brought it to the National Film\nTheatre in London where it thrilled\nthe 300 audience members, who all\nvoted using devices resembling remote\ncontrols. Since then screenings are also\norganised in Prague, as well as at various film festivals, and the interactive\nDVD and a book about Kinoautomat\nare now also available.\nWilliam Castle, popular for his unusual film promotions in the 1950s, also\nallowed the audience to vote in his\nfilm Mr Sardonicus (1961). This was\nat a time when television drew audiences away from the cinema, so Castle\nstrived to make the cinema experience\nmore interesting to get more viewers so\nhe could make more money. Audiences would get a card with a thumb-up\non, and depending on how they turned\nthe card this could be a thumb up or\nthumb down. At the end of the movie,\nthey would get their say as to how the\nmovie finishes. This was known as the\nPunishment Toll because the audiences could decide to punish the nasty\nMr Sardonicus. IMDB says \u201cBefore the\nending, Castle appeared on the screen\nand explained the poll. He then \u201ccounted\u201d the votes. If mercy won, then the\nhappy ending would be shown. If no\nmercy won, the original ending would\nbe shown. It is doubtful, though, that\nany audience voted mercy.\u201d\nThis was a far cry from the sophistication of Cincera\u2019s Kinoautomat and\na more recent Cinelabyrinth. Cinelabyrinth was promoted as \u201cthe world\u2019s\nfirst labyrinth-style Cinematic System,\u201d\nand shown at Expo \u201890 in Osaka. This\nis how artist Michael Naimark describes it :\u201dEveryone began in a single\nlarge theatre sitting on the floor. At the\nfront on each side of the screen was a\ndoor. After the first scene was played\nout, the audience was asked to choose\none of two options by walking through\none of the two doors. The story was an\necology yarn about kids trying to save a\ngrand old tree from greedy developers.\nAfter seeing several scenes and making several choices, enough to totally\nlose one\u2019s sense of direction inside the\npavillion, one watches the final scene,\nwhere the children successfully save\nthe tree. At the moment when the kids\nshout \u201cwe did it!\u201d, the screen in front\nraises up to reveal a full-size replica of\nthe tree used in the film. Simultaneously, three other screens on the other\nthree sides of the tree rise up, reveal-Easy laughs with a frustrated virgin on the road\nThe title says it all. A high-school kid\nthat just can\u2019t get laid, a long drive\nacross the United States, a love triangle and a once-in-a-lifetime road trip\nthat slowly turns into a journey from\nhell - if this doesn\u2019t sound familiar then\nyou are seriously lacking some basic\nfamiliarity with teenage comedies. The\nnow iconic American Pie which surprised everyone with its world-wide\nsuccess exposed a seriously ignored\nand still largely un-tapped niche in the\ncinema market. Obviously, the \u2018oh my\ngosh, that\u2019s gross\u2019 reactions brought a\nlot of money. The capitalist forces of\nsupply and demand, which are the unconquerable rulers of the film industry\nwere allowed to act and the situation\nwas promptly rectified. The result was\na swamping of the screening rooms\nwith comedies whose sole aim was to\nmake the young and mostly uninici-ated audience cringe as much as pos-sible. The plot never changed but the\nquality of entertainment provided followed a sharply negative slope.\nThus, the first scene of Sex Drive\nin which a pair of underwear suffers\nthrough a young chap\u2019s erotic dream\nand ends up on the floor only to be,\ninevitably, stumbled over by a blissfuly\nignorant parent, understandably filled\nme with dread. Unrightly so, as it turns\nout, even though the movie follows a\nplot that is the benchmark of the modern teenage comedy.\nThis time, the sexually frustrated\nkid is Ian (Zuckerman), a fresh highschool graduate obsessed with the fact\nthat he can\u2019t lose his virginity. Lance\n(Clark Duke) who has found the way\nto get girls into bed with him does his\nbest to help his best pal Ian but with\nlittle success. When Ms. Tasty, a girl\nmet online, suggests that Ian comes\nup to Tennessee so that they can meet\nin person for a night of serious \u2018love\nmaking\u2019, Lance succeeds in convincing\nhis friend to steal his brother\u2019s (James\nMarsden) 1969 GTO and act on the\ndream come true. Joining them, but not\nknowing the real reason for the trip is\nJonathan Dakin\nFilm Editor\ning four theatres with everyone who\nbegan in the first room, now all facing\neach other. The gag was that no matter\nwhich options were chosen, the kids\nsuccessfully saved the tree.\u201d\nMore recent examples of interactive films involve Switching (2003) and\nLate Fragment (2007). As interesting\nas they are, they are straight to DVD\nfilms aimed at a small audience and so\nit is hard to classify them as \u2018democracy in cinema\u2019 because viewers don\u2019t\nreally get to choose what happens; by\npressing the button they just switch\nto another scene \u2013 not knowing what\nthis is going to be or why. So it is just\nswitching between fragments.\nI think that this interactivity feature\ncould provide a powerful, if yet unexplored opportunity for education\nthrough film, as a film about the environment could let viewers see how\ntheir lifestyle choices (e.g. smoking,\npollution, recycling) affect their lives\nas well as the planet.\n*Note from the editor (JD): Return\nTo House On Haunted Hill (2007) was\na direct-to-DVD horror film that was\nsolely interactive: you can choose (with\nyour DVD remote) what the characters\ndecide to do and so your decisions effect the ultimate outcome of the film.\nThere are several alternative endings\nas well as many different scenes, and\nwhat you decide can prolong or reduce\ncertain characters survival time.\nMax Payne (Wahlberg), a cold-case\ninvestigator, is dragged into the world\nof death and destruction by the murder of his wife and child. Whilst continuing to search for the murderer so\nhe can exact revenge, the arrival of a\nstrange and dangerous new drug on\nthe streets of New York temporarily\ndistracts him from his vendetta. After\ntwo murders, both directly involving\nhim, Max finds himself caught up in\nsomething bigger than he imagined,\nand with the help of Mona Sax (Ku-nis), a gun-toting dominatrix, they try\nto take down the people responsible\nfor these deaths across the city.\nThe film starts off well, building an\ninteresting and involving plot, before quickly descending into chaos.\nMany plot points are left unexplained\nor unresolved, and the many stock\ncharacters and locations are briefly\nintroduced through clunky dialogue\nand obvious exposition. What begins\nas a crime thriller soon becomes su-pernatural, and without being well\nexplained, it is hard to know what the\npoint of having demons flying around\nis (except for looking cool).\nWahlberg, who usually delivers a\nsolid performance, seems bored and\nuninvolved, whereas rapper Ludacris\nstruggles to be believable as a character or as an actor. The best performances in the film are by Kunis and\ncurrent Bond girl Olga Kurylenko,\nboth being evocative and seeping sex\nbut at the same time being strong and\npowerful women. It is a shame that\nthey were not in the film more.\nAlthough the film plods along much\nlike any other action-thriller, there is\nnothing original or unique about it,\nexcept for the amazing cinematogra-phy. The film is extremely well shot\nand looks amazing, the backgrounds\nand set pieces instantly creating a\ncreepy and dark mood. The atmosphere is one of the film\u2019s strongest\npoints, as are the fun and clever action sequences, which involve very\nslick and stylish slow motion shots.\nIf you ignore the standardised poor\nplot, the film is actually okay, especially for a film based on a computer\ngame. I found it mainly enjoyable,\nand was not bored at any point in\nthe film. It is just a shame that with\na better script the film could have\nbeen so much better, perhaps one of\nthe best films of the year. But this is\nnot the case. It is a very same-y, usual\naction-thriller that is all style but no\nsubstance. Action film fans and Mark\nWahlberg fans may enjoy it, as well as\nthose who appreciate cinematogra-phy, but for anyone else I would struggle to recommend it.\nMax Payne HHKKK\nDirector: John Moore\nWriter: Beau Thorne & Sam\nLake\nCast: Mark Wahlberg,\nMila Kunis, Ludacris\nBeau Bridges\nFollowing on from last time\u2019s homage\nto cinema, this week we take a surreal\nand occasionally nonsensical look at\nthe impact that the DVD format has\nhad upon the industry.\nIn the early days before wax-coated\ndiscs were invented, films used to be\nshared from generation to generation\nby word of mouth. This is of course\ncompletely different to the process\nfor passing on holy scripture (word of\ngod), or indeed the art of dissociating\nyourself from real life in a fantasy online world (word of warcraft). This had\nsome advantages. When the original\nscript was somewhat lacking in flair\nor originality (think any teen movie\nreleased after American Pie) then it\ncould always be spiced up a little. Who\ncan forget Papa Joe\u2019s ragtime piano\nversion of Terminator 3?\nThere were disadvantages too, such\nas the volatile human memory, which\nwas easily corrupted by external influ-ences: Titanic\u2019s \u201cIceberg, dead ahead!\u201d\nbecoming \u201cIceland, dead ahead!\u201d, a\nclassic example of frozen food shop\ninterference. This, coupled with a blatant disregard for the accompanying\nsoundtrack (Papa Joe could only do\nArse-Trumpet), led to the development\nof more effective media for storing and\nviewing films. In the late 1990\u2019s, the\nDVD was born.\nSo what were the advantages of\nDVDs? Well for starters there was the\nenhanced picture quality, which was\nfrankly quite marvellous compared to\nvideo cassettes. To really appreciate\nit all you needed to do was invest in\na new six-figure television, complete\nwith those oxygen gold-plated hermit-ically-sealed cables. If, like most of the\npopulation, you weren\u2019t able to do that\nthen you could still enjoy DVDs too.\nThey would just look and sound like\nVHS. Other benefits included dual-layer discs. One side was the film plus\nbonus extras, whilst the other doubled\nas a handy coaster.\nBut the biggest difference with DVDs\nhad to be the introduction of the un-skippable copyright notice. With a\ngood old-fashioned tape, the start of\nthe video was always a wildly flickering\ncollection of ancient adverts, random\nclips from your parents wedding, and\nwhite noise. Yes, you never really saw\nthe first five minutes of any film as the\nfast-forward button always got stuck\nbut at least you could fast forward.\nNow we are subjected to a TV licence-esque lecture reminding us how we\u2019re\nall criminals for watching DVDs.\nStill all is not lost. It\u2019s been a few years\nsince the first DVD, prices of equipment and films have been falling consistently in recent months, and many\npeople have managed to accrue a rather nice back-catalogue of cinema. Just\nin time for Blue-ray. Blue-ray: What a\nformat! Even more quality (once you\u2019ve\nbought another new TV) and with an\neven more Draconian copy-protection\nsystem. At this rate the next format will\nbe nothing but an onscreen message,\ntelling us not to dare to think about\nwatching a movie. In the industry, I\nsuspect they call this progress.\nYour weekly film horoscope:\nWith Jupiter, Mars and Venus all currently orbiting the sun, the astrological\nsystem is in a tumultuous phase. Your\nbest bet is to keep things light to avoid\nany further confusion. Try short 30\nminute comedies that take a satirical\nlook at the week gone past, in a mocking fashion. In fact just stay in and\nwatch TV.\nFilm Cynic Clinic\nStuart Higgins\nImagine if you could give Jack and Rose a happy ending...\nbut a \u2018Payne-ful\u2019 lack of plot in Mark Wahlberg\u2019s newest film\nproves yet again that PC games don\u2019t make for great movies\nZuzanna Blasczak\nFilm Editor\nSex Drive HHHKK\nDirector: Sean Anders\nWriter: Seab Abders & John\nMorris\nCast: Josh Zuckerman,\nAmanda Crew,\nClark Duke\nThis year\u2019s version of \u2018American Pie\u2019 might not be one of the most original films but Sex Drive can proudly\nboast good acting, loveable characters and spot-on observations about the modern lascivious teenager.\nThe confidence that comes from using the Internet is amazing.\ntake on an Amish car mechanician\nwith a fondness for sarcasm is absolutely brilliant. His comedic timing is\nsimply impeccable. Although the interplay between the three main characters is pretty flawless as well, which\nis partly due to the very well scripted\ndialogues.\nSex Drive has all the vital features of a\ntypical road trip movie, which at heart\nit is - we have the unexpectedly long\njourney, the crazy drivers, the stalling\ncar, the brief stop in jail, love lost, love\nfound and a lot of references to male\ngenitals. Where it\u2019s different than other\nfilms of its kind is in the details. Sean\nAnder\u2019s movie feels complete, there\nare no gaping plot holes and even the\nmost wacky scene makes sense. Also\nit\u2019s pleasant when you watch a film and\ncan clearly see in every scene that making the movie was a lot of fun for all\ninvolved.\nI would definitely recommend joining Ian, Lance and Felicia on their cathartic journey when Sex Drive comes\nout on wide release in January 2009.\nThere\u2019s only one \u2018but\u2019; if you feel like\nyou left your immaturity somewhere\nback in the 2005, watching this comedy would be ill-advised. But I hope that\nwe\u2019re all still young enough to laugh at\nthe behaviour of our peers, remembering that at one point we were all as Ray\nBradbury wrote \u2018seventeen and crazy\u2019.\nFelicia, Ian\u2019s best friend and his secret\ncrush who, as it turns out, has the hots\nfor Lance. And so they set off, for what\nis to be a one day journey, never imagining the obstacles they eventually face\nnor the character-testing situations\nthey constantly encounter on the way.\nThe various adventures that they\nexperience and the numerous mishaps that happen to them make for an\nexceedingly entertaining watch and\nensure that you will not get bored at\nany time. I should mention here that\nalthough the humour is, most of the\ntime, rather crude and definitely on the\nimmature side, it\u2019s not overtly stupid.\nLance, for example, is not your typical\nplayboy; he\u2019s slightly chubby and his\nmethod of pulling chicks is to act like a\ndick. Maybe I\u2019m reading too much into\nthis, but to me he seemed like a real life\nparody of the \u201cThe Rules of the Game\u201d\nby Neil Strauss [Editor: a help-guide on\nhow to pick up girls] and of all those\nself-confident, outspoken kids that are\nso irritating. Clark Duke does a very\ngood job of being charming and infuriating at the same time.\nZuckerman brings a lot of warmth\nand authenticity into his acting, thus\nbreathing in a lot of life into his character who proves to be less stereotypical\nthan it seems at first sight.\nParticularly memorable, is the cameo appearance by Seth Green whose\nEvery Christmas happily unmarried\ncouple Brad (Vince Vaughan) and Kate\n(Reese Witherspoon) go to romantic\nand exotic locations for their holiday\nin order to escape their disjointed and\nbickering families. But this year fog\nhas closed the airpor, and the couple are caught on television, so when\ntheir respective parents find out what\nthey have been doing every year, they\ndemand that this time they will spend\nChristmas with them. Cue schmaltzy\nfeel good fun and crude hilarity as Brad\nand Kate visit each of their divorced\nComing Out Soon\nparents in turn: making that total up to\nfour Christmases. With an all-star cast\nincluding Jon Voight and Sissy Spacek,\nthis is the feel good film of the year,\nwhere I am sure everyone will learn\nthat the most important thing is family.\nOr love. Or something equally cheesy\nand vomit inducing. So if you want to\nget into the Christmas spirit, and learn\nthat love is always close at hand, this is\nthe film to watch. (But if you\u2019d rather\nnot, perhaps you should consider joining me in watching horror films and\ndepressing dramas, in order to avoid\nglossy sugarcoated American family\nvalues at all costs. I feel queasy just\nthinking about it.)\nJonathan Dakin\nFilm Editor\nGet into the Christmas mood with\nVince Vaughn and Four Christmases\nAhh, typical american Christmas. No wonder Reese has a funny face.\n\n"

They triumphantly\ncame home with the gold prize for\ntechnical excellence, top prize for best\nmanufacturing-themed project, and\nanother for best new \u2018part\u2019; which refers to Bacillus subtillis bacteria used\nin the project.)\nProfessor Richard Kitney, a Professor\nof the Imperial team gauged the international achievement they attained,\nsaying \u201cOur team has performed brilliantly and it\u2019s fantastic that we did so\nwell when faced with competition from\nother leading university teams from\nthe UK and around the world.\u201d\nThe four-month project involved\na team of nine undergraduates from\nLife Sciences and Bioengineering, four\nadvisors and two professors with the\nconcept of turning harmless bacteria,\nBacillus subtilis into efficient biofab-ricators. The hope is that the bacteria\nwill be able to produce self-assembling\norganic compounds, such as cellulose,\non demand, and in a pre-meditated\npattern.\nThe application behind the team\u2019s\nwinning concept will go onto aid many\nindustrial procedures, from recon-structive surgery to the manufacture\nof eco-clothing. Professor Paul Freemont, another of the team\u2019s advising Professors had great hope for the\nfuture of the biofabricator, saying the\nteam\u2019s hard work \u201csets up other engineers and life scientists from around\nthe world to use this harmless bacteria\nas a chassis for other synthetic biology\napplications.\u201d\nUndergraduates Erika Cule (Bio-chemistry 3rd Year), James Chappell\n(Biochemistry 3rd Year), Tom Adie\n(Biology 3rd Year) and Chris Hirst (Bi-otechnology 3rd Year), Krupa Hirani,\nYanis Djinnit, Clinton Goh, Qin Qi,\nand Prudence Wing-Yan Wong (all\nBioengineering Various Years) will all\nnow return back to the day-to-day proceedings of College life.\nDaniel Wan\nNews Correspondent\nThe Imperial College 2008 iGem team\nNew laws introduced by the government as part of the Climate Change Bill\nshortly to receive Royal Assent, allow\nthe Government to charge for bin col-lections.

After clarifying\nthe previous meeting\u2019s minutes on\nCouncil and on Live! the situation was\nresolved without a hitch.\nAfter Council Chair made his points,\nthere were three main agendas to be\nresolved firstly there was the bi-elec-tion to elect ordinary members for the\nfaculty unions, which, rather unsur-prisingly were all filled, apart for the\nRoyal College of Science Union seat.\nThe other two agendas covered the\ncreation of two new seats on Council.\nThe first of the two papers to be discussed was the creation of a new International Student Officer. Council had\nto vote on amendments to the paper\nfirst, and decide whether or not all students could stand for the positions, or\nwhether it would only be international\nstudents. Before any of this could be\ndecided, Council first had to agree\nupon the definition of international\nstudents. It was decided that international students would be all those students outside of the United Kingdom.\nThis included the Channel Islands,\nwho College consider as International\nstudents and thus pay the full fee.\nThe second amendment to the paper\nwas deciding whether or not all students should be allowed to vote. Alex\nGrisman, who is the Academic Affairs\nOfficer (Taught) for City and Guilds\nCollege Union, made the point that\nthe role would only effect international\nstudents and that therefore only international students should be eligible to\nvote. This turned out to be the case\nand the motion was passed.\nThe second paper presented by Deputy President (Education & Welfare)\nHannah Theodorou, looked for a reshuffle of postgraduate positions. Miss\nTheodorou felt that the current representation of postgraduate students\nwas ineffective. The paper suggested\nremoving the current postgraduate positions from the faculties and placing it\ninto the Graduate School Association\n(GSA), which would cover both taught\nand untaught postgraduates.\nAgain the question of representation came into question as it was discovered that any postgraduate could\nstand for the various positions. Other\nCouncil members commented on the\nfact that this method is the best solution in the current situation, although\nsome disagreed.\nBoth of these two new roles will be\neffective immediately.\nCouncillors voting at the meeting on Monday night\nConservatives see 50% target\nas unrealistic\nDina Ismali\nNews Correspondent\nThe government\u2019s approach to university expansion is like \u201ctrying to drive a\ncar with the accelerator and brake both\npressed to the floor\u201d, says Tory universities secretary, David Willetts.\nWillett\u2019sremarkwasmadeinaspeech\nat the University of Kent last week,\nat a time when the Higher Education\nFunding Council for England (Hefce)\nwrote to all universities asking them\nto \u2018review their planned recruitment\nfor 2009/10,\u2019 warning there will be no\nfunding for extra university places in\n2010/11. Although 10,000 additional\nstudent places were to be financed for\n2009/10, those numbers have already\nbeen allocated to universities since\nJanuary 2008. This means that university places will be capped for the next\ntwo academic years.\nWillett\u2019s went on to say: \u201cIn 1999,\nthe government promised to get 50%\nof young people to university by 2010.\nIt is a scandal that the figure remains\nbelow 40% and, for men, the chances\nof reaching university are actually going downwards.\u201d\n\u201cIt is absurd to have a target for 50\nper cent participation and specifically\nto prohibit universities from meeting\nit.\u201d\nAlthough Labour committed itself\nlong ago to sending half of all young\npeople to university by 2010, the university participation rate for young\npeople has only risen by 0.6% since\n1999-2000 and stands at 39.8%.\nThe Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development\u2019s (OECD)\nannual evaluation of different education systems shows that the UK has\nslipped from 4th to 12th in the international league table for the proportion\nof young people going to university.\nOne of the countries overtaking the\nUK is Poland. In 1990, Poland sent one\nin eight of its young people to univer-sity, however, today it sends one in two.\nSo while the UK will undershoot the\n50% target, Poland has already hit it.\nGovernment\u2019s aim of widening university participation may also be hampered by its recently discovered \u00a3200m\nfunding shortfall. This prompted the\nuniversities secretary, John Denham,\nto announce Labour\u2019s u-turn on proposals to offer grants to students with a\nhousehold income of less than \u00a360,000.\nThis has now been reduced to \u00a350,020.\nThis decrease in the limit is expected\nto affect some 40,000 students starting\nuniversity next year.\nLast week university think tank Million warned that restricting student\nnumbers risked damaging widening participation, particularly among\nunder-represented groups. A wide-ranging review of the higher education\nfunding system is being called for, in\nparticular costs and benefits of university expansion.\nTory University Secretary David Willets\n\n"

Cornish &\nMustapher Botchway\nSports Editors\nToo many teams? Superclubs\nstill the best solution\nT\nhe league table is here!\nStart getting excited about\nthe prospect of the ultimate prize (to be decided\nin due course)!\nIn other news, we have a big debate\nabout the vandalism in Hammersmith\nCelebrations are fine, but let us celebrate without causing a fuss.\nMustapher has managed to track\ndown a captain to express his opinions\nabout the Rugby Club. Hopefully this\nwill now be weekly feature. Want to be\ninterviewed? Drop us a line.\nLast week\u2019s editorial prompted mass\ndebate from the Miners. Medical\nSchool students, what are your views?\nDear Editors,\nDo we need \u201ctea society\u201d or a \u201ccheese\nsociety\u201d? The answer is clear, yes we\ndo, because the students want one and\nsurely the purpose of the Union is to\ngive the students what they want. There\nwould be no faculty teams if no-one\nwanted them, nobody would show up to\nplay and they would vanish.\nThe whole point of a faculty team\nis for people to play sports who don\u2019t\nhave the time to attend the sometimes\ndemanding schedule of IC teams. For\nexample, I believe IC Rugby have over 3\ntraining sessions a week. They are also\nfor people who want to take up a new\nsport in a no-pressure environment or\nfor people that cannot commit to every\ntraining and match session. Although\nit\u2019s great that some people are good\nenough to play in a first team (it obviously makes then fell like a big man) it\u2019s\nnot for everyone. Merging all teams into\none \u201csuperteam\u201d wont change the strain\nclubs have on the IC purse strings either,\nif people where to join IC teams instead\nof faculty teams then surely the club\nwould need more money to support the\nnew members? In fact, having players\njoin the IC teams as well as their faculty team (as many do) means they pay\nmembership to two clubs and so provide the college with more income!!\nThe point about playing for a social\nteam, which the Sports Editor referred\nto as \u201cbollocks\u201d is more about the relaxed social atmosphere on the pitch\nas opposed to at the pub (where it also\nexists of course). Faculty teams, due to\ntheir general lower league ranking don\u2019t\ntake games as seriously as games in the\npremiership division so people (espe-cially beginners) are not pressured or\nshouted at if they don\u2019t play well which\nis a big factor for people who are starting out and for anyone else who just\nwants to do some exercise, spend time\nwith their mates and get some fresh air.\nThe Editors belittling of the RSM Football team is exactly the kind of attitude\nwe want to avoid and is exactly why we\nlike our faculty teams, so thank you for\nproving our point for us.\nCharlotte Atteck\nDear Editors,\nI personally play hockey for RSM and\nIC 1st team, so can appreciate the argument that if every hockey player at\nImperial played for the same club, then\nthat club would be superior and more\n1 2 3 4 5 5 6 7 8\n9\n9 10\n11 12\n11 12\n14 15\n13 14 15 16\n16 17 18 19\n17 18 19 20 21\n21 22\n22 23 24\n25\n25 26\n27 28 28\nAnswers to: sudoku.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nCrossword No. 1,416\nAcross\n1 Merchandise comes out of\nprofessional channel (7)\n5 Claimed spacecraft landed around\nspecified area (7)\n9 Replacement sports team become\nless active (7)\n10 Badly-cooked hamburger filling\ngives offence (7)\n11 Lower the degree a graduate\nfinishes with after attendance\ndrops at the end (9)\n12 Currency in Europe loses a zero:\ncatastrophic (5)\n13 Swiss mathematician keeps the\nFrench at the heart of Western\nEurope (5)\n15 Lousy soccer hit bounces around\n(9)\n17 Firing Southern girl into a clock\nface (9)\n19 Nice - a Christian council was held\nhere (5)\n22 A party being crazy (5)\n23 Rising after beer is split...

However, it must be understood that not every hockey player at\nImperial would want to play for such\na club. Such a mergence would mean\nthat the banter that comes with Varsity\nday and inter-faculty matches would\nbe lost.\nRSM are a more relaxed team, with\nabilities ranging from novice to county-standard players. We attract those who\ncannot commit to training each week\nbut like to play their chosen sport on\na regular (or not so regular) basis. We\nalso offer mixed hockey every Sunday,\nsomething which IC does not. I find it\nappealing that RSM sports are less of\na financial drain too. I was shocked to\nhear the cost of IC Rugby subs is \u00a370\nthis year, plus \u00a32 per training session\nand the average match costing ~\u00a34-\u00a35.\nRSM rugby on the other hand is a mere\n\u00a310 a year.\nThe highlight of the RSM calendar\nis the Bottle Match; the second oldest\nvarsity match in the world. This fixture\nhas taken place for 107 years and is attended by over 300 people, making it a\nvery attractive event for Geology and\nMaterial related companies. This is\nwhy such companies are interested in\nsponsoring our teams, and this, along\nwith the RSMU, is where we get the\nmajority of our funding, NOT from the\nACC.\nAbolishing RSM teams would mean\nlosing traditions that are older than\nImperial College itself. There is also the\nissue that certain Imperial clubs (cough\nFootball cough) have reputations that\ntheir RSM counterparts would not like\nto be associated with.\nKingston thrashed by ladies\nHockey\nImperial Women\u2019s 1st XI 2\nKingston Women\u2019s 1st XI 1\nWe arrived at the Kingston pitch to\nfind it covered in thick brown sludge.\nWe were grumbling about getting our\nbeautiful new kit splattered with mud,\nto our surprise Preying Mantis was\nthe most annoyed by the situation (we\nsoon realised that it was only because\nit meant that she might actually have to\nwash her kit before the end of term!).\nWe got started with the match in the\nfirst half there were a couple of near\nmisses from us, some good runs from\nMalvinas and Slippery Nipple, a few attacks into our D from Kingston which\nwere cleared neatly by Leper and some\ngood saves from keeper Fresher Jess.\nWe kept our game up and a very well\ntaken long corner from Preying Mantis\nand Malvinas resulted in the ball being\ncrossed to the far post where Stripper\nslotted it into the goal. At half time\nwe were still 1-0 up and keen to score\nmore goals.\nThe second half was filled with\nmany more attacking opportunities\nwith some good drives through the\nmidfield from Token Lezza and a few\nruns up the wing by Preying Mantis\nwhere she was fouled all the way. The\ndefence continued to block any Kingston attacks with Kebab making some\nstrong tackles and passing it to Dominator on the right who flicked it up the\nline to Malvinas. Sloppy Seconds held\nthe centre defence picking up any stray\nballs and making some nice switches\nto both Fresher Sam and Wide Open.\nWe had a few short corners which unfortunately did not result in any goals,\nhowever, Prince Charles soon put that\nright when she dribbled past the defence and took a hard strike from the\ntop of the circle which cleanly hit the\ntop of the back board making the score\n2-0.\nWe kept working throughout the last\nten minutes but unfortunately with five\nminutes still to go they managed to invade our circle and after a few unlucky\ntackles somehow a ball rolled over the\nline and they had scored a rather messy\ngoal. We kept the pressure on after\nthat and there were no more attacks\ninto our circle which meant that we\nfinished with a victory. We went out to\ncelebrate that evening to the same \u2018Half\nPrice Curry House\u2019 that we went to the\nprevious week but this time with two\ndifferent men\u2019s hockey teams accompanying us, after all we are at Imperial\nand so have to spread ourselves out\nevenly between the four men\u2019s teams,\nalthough the men\u2019s 1sts are hottest.\nPrince Charles\nWhat a bunch of talented ladies. They aren\u2019t half bad at hockey either!\nWith all of this in mind I think it is\nhealthy to have a choice of clubs for\nsports within our University that cater\nfor the needs of their players differently.\nAfter all we pride ourselves with having\nthe largest number of clubs and societies out of all UK institutions.\nSammy Jones\nFirstly thank you for your responses.\nDo we need a tea Soc? If I want to\ndrink tea with some friends then yes\nCharlotte I would join such a society.\nHowever, I can categorically say that\nan RSM tea society is not needed,\nhence why to my knowledge there isn\u2019t\none. Same with cheese. Moving on,\nRugby may hold multiple sessions a\nweek but they are compulsory for the\n1st XV only. The 4th XV hardly to train\nin the first place anyway! In regards\nto football, training is recommended\nthough again the 7th XI don\u2019t train as\nmuch. This nullifies your point regarding time constraints. I actually believe\nclubs that state that all standards are\nwelcome because though, like Jack, I\nrepresent ICUAFC 1st XI, the 7th XI\nis a team of people who want to give\nfootball a try or have very little experience playing.\nFurthermore, no, the lower teams\nare not shouted at if they are losing.\nSorry to dispel such preconceptions of\nthe bigger clubs. Further play nintendo\nwii in your garden, multiplayer, if you\nwant some exercise with your mates in\nthe fresh air. Alternatively join a bigger\nclub where you can get all of that, plus\nmore.\nSammy, I find it preposterous that\npeople would want to play for RSM\nhockey, but not ICHC. I just don\u2019t see\nthe logic, especially if RSM hockey\nhave county standard players. I am yet\nto meet someone who has played to a\nhigh-ish standard that doesn\u2019t want to\nplay with players of a similar ability.\nAgain, my main argument is not to\nabolish these clubs in it\u2019s entirety. Of\ncourse keep them for the Bottle match,\nand maybe stretch the definition of the\ninter-faculty competitions and allow\nyou to play. I feel that all this could be\ndone if said teams were actually part of\ntheir larger counterparts.\nExample: The Shankman & Hardwick trophies took place last year between the RCS and CGC football and\nhockey teams respectively. I can for a\nfact say that I didn\u2019t have to raise any\namount of sponsorship or union funds\nto put together an RCS XI.\nPoint taken about the reputation of\ncertain clubs. However, that implies\nthat everyone in the football club condones what happened last Wednesday,\nwhich is certainly false.\nThe solution is to abolish such teams\nto the extent that they receive no funding and are prohibited from taking part\nin ULU/BUCS competitions, leaving\nthe bigger clubs to receive more funding (ICU still fund you, no matter how\nmuch you hide/deny it) to subside the\nsometimes costly membership fees\nand more players of any standard who\nwant to play their respective sport.\nMustapher Botchway\nFelix sports league\nfinally graces us\nwith it\u2019s presence!\nI\nt\u2019s back! Let the inter-sport rivalry commence. It seems like\nSquash have started where they\nhave left off and are currently\nriding high in the table. Rugbby men\u2019s 1st on the other hand have\nstarted poorly in BUCS, leaving them\nrooted to the bottom. However, it is\nearly days yet. There are approximately\nanother 10 games to go so there is all\nto play for. There are slight changes to\nthis year\u2019s league table. Firstly the felix\nindex (FI) has been formulated in a\nvery complex manner to reflect the average points won per game. The points\nsystem is exactly the same as last year:\n5 points for a win, -4 points for a loss\nand 2 points for a draw. Again BUCS\nteams will only be considered for ease.\nA ULU counterpart may be devised in\nfuture weeks to reflect the majority of\nsports played at Imperial.\nWhen more games are played the\nclub standings will appear. Furthermore, the team(s) of the week/month\nmay grace these pages.\nOne thing that is vital for this to work\nis if you send in your results to Alissa\nAyling as soon as possible so we can\nkeep the league up to date. Good luck!\n\n"

Within this all\nso loving SMS message were the words\n\u201cfelix down.\u201d Now I have just implied\nthat this text message was more in\ndepth than it really was. \u201cfelix down\u201d\nwere the ONLY words included in the\nall so friendly communication medium.\nSeriously, whatdafuh?

Apologies about last week\u2019s\nabsence - an update\npatch killed the connection between our Mac\nTiger servers and Leopard iMacs, so\nour article submissions were flying all\nover the room and mine just got lost!\nLike the folks on this week\u2019s Engadget\npodcast put it: \u201cit\u2019s a great time to be\nalive\u201d, with two of my most-anticipated\ndevices - HTC Touch HD and Sony\nEricsson Xperia X1 - being launched, as\nwell as the INQ1 Facebook phone from\n3, and a new iPhone firmware expected\nto come out soon. I\u2019m actually very\nsurprised to hear that the Blackberry\nStorm does not have wifi, probably to\nmilk more money from unlimited-data\nplans. If you\u2019re lucky enough to be an\nowner of the Touch HD, Storm, Xperia\nX1 or even the T-Mobile G1, we\u2019d like\nto hear from you.\nWhilst on the topic, I\u2019ve recently\npicked up the unreleased (abandoned?)\nSony Ericsson M610i smartphone from\neBay. I don\u2019t know why but every now\nand then I do search for prototype mobile phones or even laptops. I\u2019ve never\nused a Symbian phone properly before\n- the last one (and my first ever) I had\nwas the Sendo X, which I sold just two\nweeks after I bought it, simply because\nof my dissatisfaction with its sync\nspeed with Windows. The hardware\nwas well-built though, but that didn\u2019t\nsave the company from liquidisation.\nHowever, the M610i was overshad-A\npple\u2019s anti-Windows\ncampaign has been quite\nsuccessful with getting PC users\u2019 attention,\nboosting their computer sales figure to an all-time-high 2.6\nmillion in Q4 2008; likewise for their\niPhone figure, jumping from Q3\u2019s 717k\nunits to Q4\u2019s staggering 6.9 million\nunits. If you\u2019re wondering whether it\u2019s\ntime for you to join the Mac party, then\nyou might find this article useful.\nI had been waiting for the right MacBook for a long time, the previous generations being impractical with their\nscratch-magnetic polycarbonate cases.\nSo when the aluminium MacBooks\ncame out four weeks ago, I was so fascinated by its manufacturing process\nthat I immediately bought my first ever\nMac (the 2.0GHz MacBook) at the Regent Street Store the next day. It was\nabout time as well: I\u2019ve been through\nfive or six Windows laptops and have\nsuffered from the lack of built-in, pro-fessional-looking multimedia editors.\nYes, Windows Movie Maker is very\neasy to use, but its boring templates\nmean your videos will all look the\nsame; not the best choice if you want\nyour video to stand out.\nBack in the Windows days I was stuck\nwith Adobe Premiere Pro and Nero Vision, both being very time-consuming\nto edit with and the latter provided\nonly a few DVD menu templates of acceptable presentation. In the contrary,\nwhen I came across Apple\u2019s impressive\niMovie app at the Regent Street store,\nI couldn\u2019t stop thinking how much better my DVDs could have been, and\nhow much time I could have saved\nback then with a Mac.\nNow my dream of owning the perfect machine has come true. Or has it?\nHere are my thoughts of my first-Mac\nexperience so far:\nBuild quality / Service\nLet\u2019s talk about the hardware first. I\nam probably the world\u2019s unluckiest guy\nto have gone through two MacBooks\nwithin four days after my purchase:\nthe first one had a dead pixel (and apparently I was the first in the country\nto have reported a problem with the\nnew MacBook), but fortunately Apple did a direct\nswap followed by\nan overnight migration service. I\nthought that was\na smooth process,\nuntil on my way\nhome on the bus\nI noticed that the\nreplacement had\na chipped hinge,\nwhich brought\nme back to the\nstore. Hopefully my third\none (which\nI\u2019m typing on\nright now)\nwill be less\ntrouble-some. Having said that,\nI must praise Apple\u2019s efficient service\nbut do be careful with where you service your Mac: some Hong Kong users\ntold me that they were refused replacements for having just one dead pixel\ninstead of three or more.\nThe actual body itself is very well-built: London-born Jony Ive CBE, Apple\u2019s Senior Vice-President of Industrial Design, calls it \u201cprecision aluminium\nunibody enclosure\u201d (kudos for not\nsaying \u201caluminum\u201d) which provides a\nvery strong structure with fewer parts.\nLike my old ThinkPad, I would happily pick up my MacBook on just one\ncorner, with the lid open, knowing that\nit wouldn\u2019t flex. I originally feared that\nthe metallic edges were going to be a\nproblem, but they are actually nicely\nsanded for your wrists\u2019 pleasure, unlike\nthe plastic MacBooks.\nInput Interface\nThe new glass trackpad now supports\nmulti-touch gestures, making life a lot\neasier: scrolling is the same as before\nwith two fingers, three-fingers for forward and backward, four-fingers for\nExpos\u00e9 (similar purpose to Vista\u2019s \u201cFlip\n3D\u201d), the obvious rotation and zoom\ngestures etc. It really didn\u2019t take long to\nget used to these. Also, the click button is gone! Steve Jobs is known to hate\nbuttons (although we have yet to see\na touchscreen Mac) so now the entire\ntrackpad has cleverly become the but-ton. Again I found it very easy to use,\nas your thumb can still click on where\nthe button used to be. Right-click is\nmade easier as well by just clicking\ndown with two fingers.\nPorts and Guts\nNow this is where Apple has let everyone down: the MacBook no longer has\na Firewire port (a high speed connection for camcorders and hard drives).\nAs mentioned before, one of my main\nintentions of getting a Mac was for\nvideo editing, so Cupertino has broken\nmy heart a little here. To make up for\nit though, Apple\nteamed up with\nNVIDIA and\ngave birth to the\n9400M chipset,\nwhich churns\nout much more\ngraphics power\nthan the old\nMacBook.\nThe sweeties\nfrom previous\nmodels are still\nhere: the MagSafe power\ncord connector is probably still the\nbest invention to date\nin the laptop world,\nfollowed by Apple\u2019s compact power\nadapter which has two retractable\nhooks for cable management. The\nslide-in optical drive and the screen\u2019s\ngradual ambient light sensor alone are\nenough to force Oxford redefine the\nword \u201ccool\u201d.\nAll the ports are neatly located on\nthe left hand side of the laptop, which\ncan be both a good thing and a bad\nthing: the good is obviously the neatness and clean look, but the downside\nis that you may have to relocate your\nvarious peripherals to reach the ports,\nand then you\u2019ll worry about the lack of\nextra USB ports: I personally find that\nfive should be the standard for anyone\n(mouse, pen drive, iPod/iPhone, printer and camera), so MacBook users will\nhave to invest on a USB hub (powered\nones are recommended).\nStability\nNow onto the software front: Mac users have always been proud of their\nsystem\u2019s stability, but over the last few\nweeks I had already had several crash-es. For instance, I bought an HP all-in-one printer with the new MacBook,\nbut when I attempted to do some scanning the entire system just crashed,\nforcing me to hard-reboot; and literally\njust now it crashed again when I was\nsimply browsing my documents, and\ntook at least five reboots to get back to\nthe normal state. At neither events did\nRavi\u2019s advice of using \u201ccmd+alt+esc\u201d\n(Mac\u2019s \u201cCtrl+Alt+Del\u201d) work. Perhaps\nit\u2019s just early days.\nMy other problem is iPhoto: it\u2019s simply stupid. I tried to burn an album\nonto a CD using iPhoto, but rather\nthan having a disc full of JPEG files I\ngot three versions of iPhoto library\nfiles instead, forcing you to use iPhoto\nto load the photos. Lame.\nIgnoring all the above though OS X\nreally is quite nice: even for a first-tim-er like myself it\u2019s very easy to use, and it\ntakes literally only a few seconds from\nlid closed to fully awake, search is light-ning-fast, awesome \u201ciLife \u201808\u201d suite bar\niPhoto, expandable workspace using\nSpaces, powerful self-repair tools etc.\nVerdict\nOverall, the experience so far is quite\nnice and I have only the few regrets\nmentioned above plus a dented bank\naccount. OS X is very easy to pick up,\nbut if you think otherwise then I\u2019m\nsure the free Apple seminars at Regent\nStreet will be of great help. Many say\nthat once you go Mac, you never go\nback (like felix has done), but I doubt\nI\u2019ll become one of those \u2013 Mac is obviously not as perfect as many fanboys\nclaim, plus Windows machines love my\nwallet. If you insist on getting the new\nMacBook/MacBook Pro, I suggest that\nyou hold on for a few more weeks to let\nApple rid the bugs in the new systems.\n\u201cFor a first-timer\nlike myself it\u2019s\nvery easy to use\u201d\nowed by the arrival of my Touch HD\nand Xperia X1. Both Windows Mobile phones are probably HTC\u2019s best\nphones to date, even though the latter is released under a different brand.\nBuild quality is superb, probably only\nlet down by the less-than-ideal OS\n(many wish for Android on them). The\ngraphical interface is great but still far\nfrom perfect (laggy, lacking few practical functions, etc.). If I were to choose\nmy favourite out of the two, I think the\nXperia\u2019s keyboard has won my heart.\nMoving on to cameras: have you\nseen the sample movies recorded on\nthe Canon EOS 5D Mark II? This 21.1-megapixel DSLR does some real good\nHD video capture, and the quality\nbeats the Nikon D90\u2019s jelly-like, 720p\nvideo recording (and I am admitting\nthat fault as a Nikon fanboy). Although\nquite pricey, as with most prosumer\ncameras, I like the fact that you don\u2019t\nhave to carry both a DSLR and an HD\ncamcorder, as the former alone is painful enough to carry around, especially\nthrough airports where they still limit\nyou to one hand-carry only. Well, I better start looking for a sponsor!\nThis week I decided to share my\nthoughts on my Mac virgin-experi-ence, as it would probably appeal to\nmost current Windows users (but not\nso much with stubborn Linux users).\nIf you enjoy the article, please consider\ndonating to the \u201c5D-Mark-II 4 Richard\nCharity\u201d - our phone operators in felix\nare standing by.\nIt\u2019s a good time\nto be alive...\nWeekend Timewasters\nCollegeHumor.com\nIn my opinion the best site for comedy sketches and funny clips.

The mobile distractions when out\nwith friends (or even when, perhaps,\nin lectures) used to extend to receiving\nthe occasional text message or phone\ncall. This has since been upgraded to\nbeing able to instantly acquire the latest pointless news from some society\u2019s\nmailing list that you now regret signing\nup for in freshers\u2019 fair.\nUnfortunately, having used a GMail\naccount for the past 4 years (has GMail\nbeen in beta for FOUR YEARS!?), I was\nrather unhappy to find out that Google do not offer a push email service.\nSimply speaking, instead of having an\nemail arrive on my iPhone soon after\nit is sent, my phone simply checks my\nGMail account for new emails every x\nminutes, where x is a minimum of 15.\nApple originally came up with a solution by teaming up with Yahoo for\ntheir \u201cYMail\u201d service, which would\ngive \u201cfree push email to all iPhone users.\u201d However, recently, some users\nincluding myself have noticed that\nthe push email service seems to have\nsilently stopped. Although there are\nmany other push email solutions available online, I decided to try Apple\u2019s\nnew MobileMe.\nDespite being an avid mac user for\nthe last few years, I have never tried using Apple\u2019s now obsolete .Mac service.\nApple have since thoroughly improved\nthis, renaming it to MobileMe, and\ngiving great support for iPhone users.\nEven though MobileMe publicly didn\u2019t\nhave a smooth start, I decided to sign\nup for a free trial account. MobileMe\noffers much more than push email,\nincluding an address book contact list\nwhich keeps in sync over-the-air (great\nfor getting someone\u2019s number whilst\nout on your phone, and finding it on\nyour PC or Mac seconds later, without\nany need to sync), a calendar service,\nhighly comparable to Google calendar,\nadecentphotostorage/sharingwebapp,\ntightly integrated with the iPhone and\niPhoto, and finally iDisk, which is very\nuseful for having synchronized folders\nbetween your computers.\nAfterusingMobileMeforafewweeks\nand experiencing the tight integration\nservice offered, MobileMe feels like a\nproduct which really bridges the small\ngaps. Even if I didn\u2019t own an iPhone, or\neven a Mac, MobileMe is highly useful for sharing files and photos with\nfriends, and even having synchronized\nbookmarks and folders between my\nother computers. Setup is quick and\npainless, and the settings sync between\nall your devices. Back to my mac screen\nsharing is something hard to live with-out, and feels very responsive.\nOverall, I would highly recommend\nMobileMe for most Mac users. Even if\nyou just sign up for the free trial for a\nshort time, I think most will agree that\nit is a smooth and seamless service that\nkeeps those important things in sync.\n\u201cMobileMe is a new Internet service\nfrom Apple that syncs email, contacts,\nand calendars from a secure Internet\nserver, or \"cloud,\" to all the devices you\nuse: your iPhone, iPod touch, as well as\nMac and PC computers. This data is\naccessible anywhere and automatically\nensures that you get identical email,\ncontacts, and calendars, no matter\nwhich device you use. MobileMe also\nprovides a suite of ad-free web applications that deliver a desktop-like experience through any modern browser.\nMe.com is the place where it all comes\ntogether. MobileMe applications at\nme.com include Mail, Contacts, and\nCalendar, as well as Gallery for viewing\nand sharing photos, 20GB of storage,\nand iDisk for online file sharing\u201d\nMarc Kerstein\nMobile Me + iPhone = Nice?\nBackup your work\nA review of the Western Digital My Book\nRavi Pall\nTechnology Editor\nWith a previous article about the\nonline backup service provided by\nMozzy, it may be thought it would be\nworth while investing in your very own\nbackup solution. We are all hard working students living in the age of the in-ternet, but it simply isn\u2019t worth while\nbacking up all your data on an online\nservice. The downfalls including bandwidth limitations, transfer speed and\nthe knowledge that your data is with\na 3rd\nparty. It would seem for the average user at home, the simplest answer\nto this problem is to buy an external\nHDD (Hard Disk Drive). Thefore the\nfirst thing I did was to trawl though the\nThe web interface to the online Mobile Me service. Giving online access to your calendars, contacts, files, photos and mail.\nThe new MacBook with it\u2019s shiny screen.\ninternet, looking for the best solution I\ncould find at a reasonable price.\nAlong came the Western Digital My\nBook. The model I chose was latest\nversion of the My Book comes in a very\nsleek matt black finish. Asthetics aside,\nlet me engross you with the all so geeky\ndetails. My personal My Book has a\n1TB storage capacity. A bit excessive I\nknow, but some people need this storage now, and I\u2019m sure there will come\na day I will too. One of the first things\nI did was to transfer my 65GB iTunes\nlibrary across, which bearly dented the\ncapacity of this drive. At this point I\u2019d\nlike to mention how quick this was. Using Firewire 400 the whole library was\ntransferred in less than 20 minutes. As\nI have just mention the Firewire 400,\nnow is the time to mention the\nconnectivit. All the ports are on\nthe back, which include the power\ninput, 2 Firewire ports, a USB 2.0\nport and 1 eSATA port. Thats alot\nof flexibility from a drive with the\nform factor of a small dictionary.\nIt wasn\u2019t particularly cheep\nthough. The 1TB My Book with\neSATA cost about \u00a3120, but this is\nstill very competitively priced with\nsimilar products available. WD is\nalso a big name in HDD\u2019s so the\n2 year included warranty, like the\nunit, is reliable. There is no noise,\nand it runs cool even though there\nis no fan. The top feature is the automatic on sevice which only turn\nthe HDD on when connected. WD My Book\n\n"

Hermia\u2019s\nfather wants her to marry Demetrius, who is in\nlove with her. But Hermia loves Lysander and\nhe feels the same. Meanwhile, Helena\nis in love with Demetrius. That night,\nfaced with an ultimatum from the king,\nHermia and Lysander elope to the for-est. Demetrius follows Hermia, Helena\nfollows Demetrius. Into the woods\nthey all go, where in the silvery moonlight the magical Oberon holds sway\nwith his wife Titania and their slave\nPuck. And it just so happens, on this\nnight of nights, that an acting troupe\nare rehearsing their romantic tragedy amongst those same trees; Bottom\ntries to persuade Peter that he should\nplay every part. Faeries dance. Who\nwill fall in love, and with whom? Or is\nit all just a fantastic dream?\nA park in East London. Trees and a\ntent. We are ushered into a space where\nquietly excited theatregoers mill and\nhum under draperies of leaves. The expectation is palpable. All around; lean-ing, gesturing, with assured humanity,\nwe are the arbiters of our collective\nexperience. Through again into a lofty\namphitheatre; a broad stage (a bold\nstatement) brought to life by the faces\nraised towards it, by the steady ebb and\nflow of the assembled revellers. Who\nsaid Shakespeare was a dweeb?\nWelcome to Footsbarn\u2019s production\nof A Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream. These\nare no ordinary theatregoers: the average age is well below thirty, the company are warm and welcoming and\nthere is a definite sense that this is a\ncool place to be.\nThis is no ordinary theatre experi-ence: wave goodbye to your nights\nspent in gilded West End prosceni-ums, to self-important actors spewing\ngrandiose Pinter and Chekhov before\nan apathetic crowd. This uniformly\nwonderful cast deliver absolutely gen-uine, selfless performances and really\nconnect with the audience. In doing\nso, they shed light on the true spirit\nof Shakespeare, so often obscured by\nrushed delivery or static body lan-guage. The bard must have been, first,\nan entertainer, but it is hard to see him\ngaining such popularity as he now enjoys based on many modern stagings.\nFootsbarn cut down the script considerably and give free rein to the quality\nand quantity of physical emotion displayed on stage (I lost my heart early\non to a dancing mushroom). Body\nlanguage both touching and hilarious oozes from the characters. Helena\nsighs and we fall in love with one so\ntender; one resigned look from Peter at\nthe exasperating Bottom and we have\nseen it a thousand times. These actors\nhave our hearts without saying a word,\nsuch that the exquisite poetry, once it\ncomes, is more meaningful and beauti-ful. Also, crucially, because we are not\nstraining to keep up with the dialogue\nwe are able to relax and actually be\nentertained.\nThe set (more-or-less one broad,\ngnarled tree), though in concept sim-ple, works to great effect in the atmospheric and intimate tent theatre.\nVisible to the side of the stage, and\ncompletely in keeping with it, is a small\ngroup of musicians: saxophone, oboe,\ndrums, and, I\u2019m sure, a sitar. They\nlooked like they\u2019ve been stranded there\nsince 1969, grooving to an eclectic mix\nof styles. On costumes, these people\ndo not skimp. Demetrius and Lysander\nare grotesque, comically vying for superiority when their interests collide.\nTragedians\u2019 masks portray the austerity of Athens; once in the magical\nwoods the masks are comic, mischievous works of art. Puck, with maracas\nand a lovable bumbling glint in his\neyes, expresses himself almost solely\nwith a single noise.\nThese touches of aesthetic joy grow\non you throughout the evening, and\ndespite the two hours with no interval,\nI can honestly say I was never bored.\nOne toddler did get a bit restless and,\nambling curiously across the front of\nthe stage, was almost the star of the\nshow. The actors took her into the\nfold.\nA few niggles remain: Titania\u2019s diction is rushed, and much of her speech\nis very difficult to hear. This causes a\ndip in momentum, but such is the vivid\ncharacterisation and physicality of the\nactors that the effect is minimised.\nHowever, such weaknesses are hard to\nfind in a show which, with its boundless humanity, restores our faith in\nlife on a cold winter evening. Oh and\nthere\u2019s free food afterwards. Will not\ndisappoint.\nA Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream is\non until the 30th of November at\nFootsbarn Theatre. Tickets cost\n\u00a315 for students.\n\u201cThis wonderful cast deliver\ngenuine, selfless performances\u201d\nMonkey: Journey to the West\nM\nonkey: Journey to the\nWest is an ancient\nChinese tale of a\nmonkey born in a\nstone egg who, after\ncausing havoc in Heaven, annoys Buddha and then has to assist a Holy Man\nin retrieving some Buddhist scrolls\nfrom the West (India, not evil capitalist West). The journey is hundreds of\nmiles long with plenty of trials thrown\nin for good measure. So the cheeky and\nstrangely camp monkey meets up with\na Holy Man, a horse (who can\u2019t talk),\na pig (who can) and, as far as I could\nmake out, a green man and off they go\nroaming westwards, being tested by\nChinese dragons, fiery mountains and\na slightly dominatrix-esque lady with a\nsword.\nThe story has been rewritten as a\nmodern opera by Damon Albarn (of\nBlur and Gorillaz fame), the music fuses classic Chinese sounds with modern\nelectronic to interesting effect and the\nstyle of the characters and sets has a\nGorillaz \u2018take\u2019 too, which is very cool.\nIf that isn\u2019t enough, the players are\nfrom a Chinese circus who apparently\nspent most of their early lives stood on\ntheir heads (and other people\u2019s heads\nat that) as there are some seriously\nphenomenal acrobats in this show. So\nyou have a brand new opera, written\nby an established pop-hero, acted and\nsung by Chinese superhumans, cool\nGorillaz styling with a rich story and\nit\u2019s all in Chinese (with subtitles).\u2028\u2028\nNow whilst all of this stuff is excellent and done pretty well in isolation,\nit was hard to feel as if the elements really ever combined to their full poten-tial. Firstly, although the source book is\nrich and long, the opera just skims over\nit and at some points it\u2019s hard to know\nwhat is going on (hence not being able\nto tell who the green man is). Also,\nthere are some serious plot holes \u2013 like\nthe massive build-up to an encounter\nwith an evil, face-eating army, which\nnever really kicks off properly and then\nthe token bad guy just sort of walks off.\nThere are some moments that leave\nyou asking: what just happened? I want\nsome proper vanquishing, dammit!\nSecondly, although the stage combat\nis exciting at several times and makes\ngood use of the players, it never really explodes and is unfortunately less\nOng-Bak and more interpretive dance.\nFinally, whilst the music is new and\ninteresting, it\u2019s never really classic nor\nmemorable, which is a real shame.\nThere are a lot of good points and\ngood reasons to see this \u2013 conceptually it\u2019s great and it\u2019s new and exciting.\nThe Gorillaz take on everything adds a\nmodern slant to a classic Chinese story.\nIt\u2019s not rubbish. It is a cool modern op-era, it really is, and there is good stuff\nin here. The trouble is, it\u2019s not amazing\nand it should be.\nMonkey: Journey to the West is\non until the 5th of December at\nthe O2 Arena.\nBenedict Fraser hot-foots it to Footsbarn\nfor our favourite Shakespeare play\nFei Yang as Monkey (dressed in yellow in the centre) and the cast taking a bow at the O2 Arena\nDr von Hagens gives new meaning to shirts vs skins\nreal thing?\u201d asked one. \u201cYeah, I think\nitis!\u201dsaidtheother.Theygotnose-close\nwith this valuable iconic piece, which\nwas freestanding and unprotected in\nthe centre of the room. \u201cOoooh\u201d they\ncooed. I judged it best to leave them to\nenjoy themselves.\nThe exhibition did at times take on a\npreachy slant. It had a tendency to rattle on about how it\u2019s all our own fault\nthat our bodies decline and showcased\nan excess of lungs ravaged by smok-ing. I got fed up of constantly being\ntold to eat healthily, get lots of exercise and give up my excesses. But on\nthe bright side, it did also emphasise,\nin the centennial village section, how\nwe can beat time and live active and\nhappy lives well into our eighties and\nnineties. I\u2019m sorry to say there was a\ndisplay entitled \u2018sexy at sixty\u2019, suggesting that even people in their sixties\nand seventies are able to enjoy fulfilling sex lives, defying the minor issues\nof erectile dysfunction and feminine\nlubrication. And there were pictures. I\nbasically had to wash my eyes out with\nbleach after reading that bit.\nAdditional highlights were the presence of a plastinated horse and a giraffe\nin the exhibition. The horse was being\nridden by some plastinated humans,\nand was demonstrating how similar\nall mammals are inside. The difference\nis merely scale. I can\u2019t quite recall the\npurpose of the giraffe, but it was certainly impressive. Like most of the human bodies, this giraffe was male and\noffered the chance to observe that its\nreproductive regions were indeed in\nproportion. I will also note that its ar-sehole was particularly huge.\nTo criticise the exhibition, it did tend\nto stray from the purely scientific. The\nbodies were often contorted into more\nartistic positions, arms out-stretched.\nIn line with the exhibition title \u2018The\nMirror of Time\u2019, there was a display\nof two bodies floating through the air,\ntwisting around each other and holding a mirror up. Why, Dr. von Hagens?\nWhy? What purpose does that serve?\nThere was also quite a lot of arty,\nfarty photography and poetry diluting the lessons in anatomy and medi-cine, which didn\u2019t sit well with me.\nThe worst crime of all was the section\non free radicals, operating too much\nalong the \u2018Dr.\u2019 Gillian McKeith line of\nthought. A helpful video demonstrated\nhow the free radicals are coming to get\nus. This video portrayed a free radical as a floating cloud glowing different colours which wafted towards a\nbig round cell (the free radical and the\ncell were approximately the same size).\nWhen the free radical bumped against\nthe cell, the cell turned grey and shrivelled up and died. But don\u2019t worry! You\ncan stop this happening by eating fruit\nand vegetables!\nAside from this bewildering display\nof pseudo-science, I would recommend the exhibition \u2013 and not just for\nthe medics among you. It\u2019s a valuable\nand entertaining opportunity to find\nout what\u2019s inside us all and what time\nis doing to us. For your money you get\nWalking on a cloud at Tate Modern\nLeonardo Ramirez, while finding out more about Cildo Meireles , takes his socks off and wears a mask\nT\nhere is something very\ndemocratic about Cildo\nMeireles. He is neither a\nsnobbish art elitist nor the\ncommercial type who will\npaint-to-order so to please clients/art\ndealers. His art is provocative, practical and a pleasurable experience.\nAs you enter the first room, conventional ideas of space are challenged.\nThis was really the low point of the\nexhibition as I am not a fan of opt art.\nBut it gradually became more interest-ing. A bundle of 100 cruzeiros, sold for\n20 times that amount, is displayed. A\ntopical issue which begs the question;\n\u201cAre banknotes worth the paper they\nare written on?\u201d Living under the increasingly authoritarian Brazilian dictatorship of the seventies, he used the\nsame medium to protest against the re-pression, writing political messages on\nbanknotes. In the next room, there is\nan installation about prohibition.\nWalking on broken glass, surrounded\nby rope barriers, doors and barb wire,\nyou really feel as though you are breaking the rules as you wander around the\nmaze. \u2018Missions\u2019 is both aesthetically-pleasing and a political statement. A\nthin column of communion wafers\nconnects a floor covered with one\npenny coins and two thousand bones\nhanging from the ceiling. The former\nrepresents the commercial interest of\nthe Jesuit missionaries and the latter\nthe consequences of the Christianisation they carried out in parts of Argentina, Paraguay and southern Brazil. A\ncircular tower of radios, all tuned to\ndifferent frequencies and aptly called\n\u2018Babel\u2019, seems to be alive.\nBut perhaps the best piece is \u2018Fontes\u2019. The whole room is densely packed\nwith only three objects: the floor is\ncompletely covered with small vinyl\nnumbers, the walls are densely packed\nwith clocks and the space is crammed\nwith long, wooden rulers hanging from\nthe ceiling. Upon closer inspection,\nyou can see that the order of the numbers in the clocks and rulers seem to be\nrandom and the spacing between the\n\u2018units of measurement\u2019 arbitrary. As if\na long and substantial exhibition in a\nvery nice venue that will change the\nway you see yourself. Just watch\nout for those pesky free\nradicals.\nBody Worlds and\nthe Mirror of Time is\non until the 23rd of August at the O2 Arena.\nTickets cost \u00a39 for\nstudents.\nthis was not enough to overwhelm you,\nthe whole experience is enhanced with\nticks for music. After a while there,\nyou begin feel that time and space are\nelastic.\nMy favourite installation of the whole\nexhibition was, however, \u2018Volatile\u2019.\nWhile queuing (yes, it is worth it) you\ncan read a disclaimer and some recommendations \u2013 you have to wear a mask\nand take your socks off, some people\nwith respiratory conditions are advised\nnot to enter. The floor of the U-shaped\nroom is covered with about 25 centimetres of powder and the room is pitch\ndark except for a small candle at the far\nend. The sensation of walking along is\nmuch better than the fine sands of the\nCaribbean or the Indian oceans or the\nsand dunes of certain deserts (maybe\nbecause only our sense of touch is being stimulated). Did you ever feel like\nwalking on a cloud? This is as close\nas you can get. By the way, if you have\never skydived you would know clouds\nare not as pleasant as they look.\nOne word of advice: do not tackle\nyour friends, otherwise you will be escorted out of the building by the security guards.\nCildo Meireles is on until the 11th\nof January at the Tate Modern.\nTickets cost \u00a38 or free with gallery admission concessions\nThis is entitled \u201cRed Shift: 1 Impregnation 1967-84\u201d.

Time to clean out this one-cat town.\nI\nfeel like Gary Cooper halfway\ninto an old Western, bursting\nthrough the double doors of the\nsaloon as the raucous, devil-may\ncare atmosphere abruptly quiets\ndown. The doors swing back on their\nhinges as suspicious faces turn in my\ndirection. A jolly ragtime beat on the\npiano ends discordantly as the pianist\nedges away to a less conspicuous seat.\nThe game of poker stops mid-hand, as\nthe dealer looks over his shoulder, edg-ily chewing his hand-rolled cigarette\nfrom one side of his mouth to the oth-er. The bartender quietly gathers the\nmost valuable pieces of glassware and\nplaces them in assumed safety, somewhere out of sight.\n\u2018Didn\u2019t think ye\u2019d dare shew yer heed\n\u2018round these parts again, sheriff\u2019, rings\nout a voice from a darkened corner -a voice with the texture of sandpaper\nand the smell of a marinated shank\nof lamb left to hang in a pair of socks\novernight. A solitary pair of spurs can\nbe heard jangling from somewhere behind the clouds of smoke.\nA gun is whipped out of its holster:\na mirror shatters, men dive for cover\nbeneath the nearest tables, bullets fly,\na chorus girl screams from an upstairs\nbedroom, a chandelier collapses, one\npatron of the bar generously knocks\na fellow-drinker into the piano and a\nlimp body falls from the second floor\nlanding. Though not necessarily in that\norder.\nThe gunsmoke clears to reveal the\ncigarette smoke. I blow nonchalantly\non the barrel of my Colt .45, twirl it\nwith consummate elegance around my\nindex finger, pick it up off the floor and\nstick it back in its holster. I walk over\nto the dead body and solemnly down\na glass of firewater. You could cut the\ntension in the room with a knife. Come\nto think of it, you could probably have\ncut the tension with a brick. Unfortunately no-one was there to try it, so\nyou\u2019ll have to take my word for it.\nA sentence is formed in an attempt\nto restore the mood of hushed reverence so inappropriately broken. The\ncrowded hall hangs on my lips as I look\nthem over with cold indifference before turning and walking away. I stop\nat the double doors and say: \u2018The bad\ntimes are over.\u2019\nAnd they are. I\u2019m back in town; and\nthe most effervescent of apologies to\nyou all for the period of lawlessness I\nso disgracefully abandoned you with.\nFor letting the riffraff take over the\nstreets, control the concourses and hijack the highways, with their disregard\nfor good syntax, good grammar, logical rigour, self-consistency, good taste,\nrelevance, humour, generosity of spirit,\nimaginative thought, and minimum\nstandards of coherence. For dragging\nthis li\u2019l town through sheer linguistic\nhell, I can never forgive myself.\nAnd I\u2019m sorry to all of you who let\nthe independence get to your heads,\nand thought the parents were out for\nthe night. You ain\u2019t seen the last of me\nyet, boys.\nThere we go. A little apology, a touch\nof humour and we\u2019re all right again.\nAren\u2019t apologies great? I\u2019d say that they\nhave to be one of my favourite inven-tions. Right behind bagels, the BBC\niPlayer and those small buttons you\npress at zebra crossings to keep you\noccupied until the light decides it feels\nlike changing.\nApologies are a wonderful con-cept: people would never have made\nthe transition from tribal habitation\nto living alongside each other in cities without some tool to indicate an\nadmission of wrongdoing. Now using\nan apology to express regret is all very\nwell in theory. But that\u2019s not how it\ncomes out in practice. Like with everything else in this era of global recession and financial armageddon, the\nnet worth of apologies has depreciated\nconsiderably.\nAn apology is more of a way to\nsoothe one\u2019s own conscience than anything else. A receipt that if presented\noften enough and loudly enough, in a\nsufficiently large variety of ways, will\nrefund all grudges and exchange all\npotential unpleasantness for something more appealing. This cheapening\nof apologetic sentiments is largely the\nfault of the English, and their deliber-ate, large-scale undercutting of the excuses market. If, in a flight of Douglas\nAdams-ian imagery, work could be\nobtained from an Apology Drive, the\nIndustrial Revolution need never have\nhappened for Britain to lead the world\nin terms of energy production.\nBecause you really like your apologies in this country. Right behind\nmeteorological inquisitiveness and\nsports-related self-deprecation, contrition is your favourite mindset. It\u2019s\nnot that you necessarily have a lot to be\napologetic about. It\u2019s not as though you\never have anything to be particularly\nthankful about either, yet supermarkets\nand banks, pharmacies and train sta-tions, greengrocers\u2019 and museums up\nand down the land reverberate to the\nsound of the English apologizing for x\nor thanking each other for y. My Mediterranean impatience for meaningless,\nautomated responses passed off as politeness makes me slightly nauseous\nevery time one of your compatriots\ntransforms an awkward silence into a\ndiarrhoetic splurge of mindless small\ntalk, liberally laced with the \u2018s\u2019 word.\nDon\u2019t be fooled into thinking it passes you off as a considerate people. You\njust acquire a reputation for being the\nworst and most awkward light conversationalists in the world.\nIf that seems a little harsh, I ap-hmm-hmm.\n\u201cI\u2019m back in\ntown, and\nthe most\neffervescent of\napologies to you\nall for the period\nof lawlessness I\nso disgracefully\nabandoned you\nwith\u201d\nT\nhe notions of socialism\nare not so popular, unlike\nthe resistant scepticism of\nAmerica; the scepticism\nagainst student socialism\nis perhaps more justified. If anything,\nthe persistence of socialism amongst\nstudents if not at times seemingly un-educated, is simply of often rather simplistic notions of social change.\nOne of the mottos: \u2018long manifestos don\u2019t win struggles-practical unity\ndoes\u2019 I think sort of sums up what I\u2019m\ntrying to say. It gives the impression of\npeople in a room coming to the con-clusion-Of course we all agree that\u2019s\nreally wrong!-Its placard making time!\nThey\u2019re with everyone and against\neverything-the first sentence of their\npamphlet reads like an insurance sales\n(-and perhaps all politics is like this)\n\u2018whether in opposition to war, racism\nor privatisation\u2019-we\u2019re the ones you\nwant- this generality-of the more the\nmerrier here seems far too socialising-student-inspired. Immediately all that\nis translated is Sheila Rowbotham\u2019s\nrecollection of the all inclusive Oxford\nsocialist students of the 80s who spent\ntheir meetings in pubs criticising the\ndetrimental and fundamentally slowing effects of alcohol and women to\nsociety.\nThe soul of man under socialism\nmay flourish. Those countries progressing from poverty through communism suffer their criticisms despite\nobvious developments; take Cuba\nfor example, surviving the American\nBlockade and the fall of the Soviet Union is desperate and struggling development personified.\nBut it is the repetitive and apparently\npointless reappearance of student socialism that is annoying. We all know\nwhat they look like and can probably\nguess what they\u2019re going to say more\nor less, while I may seem hypocritical\ncriticising their confidence and optimistic relentlessness in the face of\nignorance, I honestly don\u2019t know that\nmuch of the effective history of student\nsocialism beyond that of the contagious spread of the \u2018change the world\u2019\nbacilli of the 60s, all that I realise is a\nnoisy pointlessness.\nCommunism is difficult, and a strug-gle, even more than Capitalism. The\nrecessions and current credit crunch\nwill inevitably be overcome, be it\nthrough socialist bail-out means or\notherwise; and besides, Communism?\n- Here? Simply looking out of an Imperial building window onto the ex-cessiveness, and extravagance that is\nKensington and all who inhabit it, the\nquestion is how?\nThe only faith to have in western hu-manity, without wasting a lot of energy\nis only in its capitalist development\nand ultimately insatiable drive. Forget\nthe little man.\nAmna Shaddad: \u201cstudent\nsocialism is annoying\u201d\nV\noltaire once said: \u201cI may\nnot agree with what you\nbelieve, but I will defend\nto the death your right to\nbelieve it.\u201d\nThis pretty much sums up my attitude towards religion. As a scientist\n(and atheist), I just don\u2019t \u2018get\u2019 it. Religious people make me a little uneasy,\nbut so do the militant clan of faith-bashers \u2013 Dawkins, Dennett, Hitchens et al \u2013 with their fervent desire to\nsee all forms of religion wiped off the\nplanet. I know the majority of religious\npeople are normal, and so I tolerate\nthem, albeit sometimes through gritted teeth.\nThat tolerance ends, however, with\nphilanthropic organisations such as\nthe Templeton Foundation. This bloated American enterprise, founded by\nthe late Sir John Templeton (a Presbyterian businessman who died earlier\nthis year at the grand old age of 95), is\ndedicated, in the words of its website,\nto answering the \u201cBig Questions\u201d in\nlife, by acting as \u201ca catalyst for research\non concepts and realities such as love,\ngratitude, forgiveness and creativity ...\n[and] questions on the laws of nature\nand the nature of the universe\u201d.\nIn plain English, this means blurring\nthe boundaries between science and\nreligion by throwing as much money in\nas many directions as possible. Think\nof it as a benevolent hippo, waving its\ntail around and flinging shit far and\nwide. Or an amoral arms dealer, selling weapons to both sides in a conflict.\nExcept that the conflict in this case\nis inside minds and institutions, and\nTempleton has gone a step further to\nactively promote it.\nAmong its many ventures, the Templeton Foundation has a publishing\narm \u2013 which reads like a catalogue\nof discredited creationist pseudoscience \u2013 and an array of lucrative\nprizes, including the Templeton Prize\n(full name: The Templeton Prize for\nProgress Toward Research or Discoveries about Spiritual Realities ... they\ndon\u2019t do snappy).\nThe Prize, at $2 million cleverly\ncalculated to be worth more than the\nFelix Whitton: The \u2018Big Question\u2019 that\nneeds to be addressed\nNobel, is given to someone who has\n\u201cmade an exceptional contribution to\naffirming life\u2019s spiritual dimension\u201d or,\nin the words of Richard Dawkins, \u201cany\nscientist ... willing to say something\nnice about religion\u201d. The Foundation\nalso gives out the \u201cEpiphany Prize for\nMost Inspirational Movie\u201d, awarded in\n2005 to the Passion of the Christ, a film\nthat was more notorious for inspiring\npeople to leave before the end.\nMore insidious, and less well-pub-licised, is the gigantic funding arm of\nthe Foundation which gives out around\n$70 million annually to scientists, research groups and institutions. Name a\nuniversity \u2013 British or American \u2013 and\nodds are that it has received money in\nsome form from Templeton.\nOxford got \u00a31 million for its Centre\nfor Science of the Mind, and the free-market espousing Templeton College\n\u2013 now Green College \u2013 changed its\nname in 1984 upon receipt of a \u201csignificant\u201d sum of money from the Foundation. Cambridge\u2019s Theology Department gives out journalism fellowships\nto writers willing to \u201cexamine the ...\ncreative interface between science and\nreligion\u201d, and recently received $3 million to research what the Foundation\nquaintly terms \u201cthe great debate\u201d over\nthe evolution of biological complexity.\nIn fact, the more prestigious the\nuniversity, the more likely it is to have\ngained in some way from this leviathan.\nHarvard, Yale, Princeton, MIT ... the\nlist goes on. Even Imperial is not beyond accepting money to study \u201cDeep\nBeauty...the Search for an Underlying\nIntelligibility of the Quantum World\u201d;\nor \u201cScience and Transcendence\u201d, which\naims to find out the \u201cnature, character\nand meaning of ultimate reality\u201d.\nEven the Royal Society \u2013 with its\nmotto \u201cRespect the Facts\u201d \u2013 seems\nto see no inconsistency in giving out\n$100,000 of Templeton\u2019s money in the\nform of essay prizes, or allowing the\nwinner to speak at its functions. The\nMichael Reiss controversy back in September is another example of the recent clash between faith and fact.\nPerhaps it is sanctimonious to expect\nall these institutions not to take such a\ngood source of funding; after all, Templeton\u2019s rise has coincided with a drop\nin government funding, both here and\nin the US. But studies have shown that\nresearchers often, consciously or not,\nfind the results their donors would like.\nThis is why scientists have to declare\nconflicts of interest if, for example,\nthey are working for a drugs company\nwhilst testing a new medicine.\nThis should all be enough to set\nalarm bells ringing, but the British media has been eerily quiet on the issue\nof Templeton money. More strange\nstill is, despite most of the UK press\u2019s\ndistaste towards the US Republicans,\nalmost no journalists have made the\nconnection between Templeton\u2019s son,\nJack, who now runs the Foundation,\nand his large donations to George W.\nBush\u2019s campaigns in 2000 and 2004,\nand to John McCain\u2019s this year.\nSo what, you may be thinking; the\nmoney has to come from somewhere,\nand Obama\u2019s campaign haul far outstripped McCain\u2019s. But for a Foundation that preaches the benefits of scientific endeavour on the one hand, while\ngiving oodles of cash to one of the\nmost backwards post-enlightenment\nregimes with the other, the contradictions are telling.\nThis, together with a stated opposition to abortion and stem-cell re-search, and recent donations in excess\nof $1 million to push through Proposition 8 \u2013 an amendment to ban gay\nmarriage in California \u2013 plus countless\nlinks to shady US organisations like the\nDiscovery Institute, is why British universities should say no to Templeton\u2019s\nmoney, at least until they have made\ntheir agenda absolutely clear.\nOtherwise, as writer and Imperial\nscientist Sunny Bains has pointed out\nelsewhere, this \u201csubtle intrusion\u201d of\nreligion into science could be the thin\nend of the wedge for a more sinister\npresence in the future.\nOne of the winners at the Templeton Prize\nStudents socialists at work\n\n"

One\nof our guys put on 10kg\nof pure fat during this\ntime.\nAfter speaking to some\nmembers\nof the\n1st team\nsquad, it\nbecame\napparent\nthat the\nteam\nwas\nmissing some players in\nkey positions, one\nof them being prop\nforwards. I\u2019ve also\nheard that the\nEditor in Chief of\nfelix has decided\nnot to play this\nyear. What can\nyou say about\nthat?\nFirstly I\u2019d like\nto say something about\nthe editor,\nhe\u2019s obviously got commitments\nto the paper\nwhich makes\nsense. As far\nas the 1st team\nforwards and\nprops, you\ndon\u2019t get many\nsmart people\nthat are mas-sive. Normally\nmassive people just sit in\nfront of the\ntelly eating\nchips, they\u2019re\nnot really active or sporty.\nAny props we\ndo get, we hold\nonto and get\nthem straight\ninto the gym.\nWe tell them\nstuff like maybe don\u2019t eat two pasties,\nmaybe eat just the one and then a protein shake, and maybe go to the gym in\nbetween.\nMoving on to the club as a whole,\nif I\u2019m not mistaken, your 2nd\nXV also got promoted last year.\nWhere do you see them going\nthis year?\nI think they\u2019ll be well established in\ntheir league, but I don\u2019t see them getting promoted just yet. They\u2019ve been\nwinning their home games and getting good results away. But as far as the\nleague goes, they probably won\u2019t go up\nthis season.\nWhat are you realistic targets this\nseason then?\nWe need to secure ourselves in the\nleague first. Our aim at the start of the\nseason was to come 4th, and we believe\nit is still attainable, but the work has\nto be done and it has to be done now.\nWe\u2019d also like to retain the Gutteridge\nCup, it\u2019s a massive thing and can hold\n20 pints, so that\u2019s always a fun night\nwhen you win that. Obviously Varsity\nis a target as well, and we hope we can\ngive another spectacle this year.\nTalking about Varsity, how did\nyou feel after last year\u2019s result?\nDevastated. But you have to realise\nthat if the medics had lost that game,\nthey would have felt worse. It was just\none of those 50/50 games and we came\nout on bottom. It\u2019s a problem we\u2019ve\nbeen having this season and something\nwe will have to turn around. It won\u2019t\njust happen over night, but we are getting better and better every game and\nit is just a matter of time before we get\nit right.\nSeeing as you are now one of the\n\u2018elite\u2019 teams at Imperial as you\nare now in the premiership, what\nsupport have you received from\nSport Imperial and/or the Union\nto help maintain this level?\nSport Imperial have been great help,\nthey try their hardest to give us everything we need as well as some of the\nstuff we ask for. There have been times\nwhere they haven\u2019t been able to help,\nprobably because we asked for too\nmuch, but they do try and meet us in\nthe middle. But yeah, they have generally been very good.\nYou\u2019ve given us your predictions\nfor the 2nd team, let\u2019s see what\nyou think about some of the other\nteams. Firstly netball 1st team?\nI hear they are having a hard time,\nbut those babes will sort it out in the\nend. They\u2019ve got those cute little pink\nhoodies, they can\u2019t lose with that can\nthey?\nHockey 1sts?\nMen\u2019s hockey 1sts, they\u2019re doing\nquite well aren\u2019t they? They always\nseem to be winning with a small margin though, 1-0, 2-1. I think they\u2019ll be\nfine this year.\nFootball 1sts?\nAsk the captain - James Pettit\nThe run-up to Varsity begins. This week, Mustapher Botchway\ninterviews the Imperial College Rugby 1st XV Captain on their\ncurrent performance and about sport in general\nName: James \u2018The Bear\u2019 Pettit\nTeam: ICU 1st XV Rugby\nPosition: Flanker\nDate of Birth: 16/10/1987\nHometown: Wisbech\nCourse: 3rd Year Physics\nHeight: 6ft\nWeight: 93kg\nHalf Man, Half Bear. Some say that there is a legend\nthat James once missed a tackle, but we all know it\u2019s\njust a myth. James likes most things but there are a\nfew things he doesnt like, such as Portsmouth, Small\nPizzas and Medics, he especially dislikes Portsmouth\nMedics.\nFACT\nFILE\nFootball are a mixed bag, they have\nquite a lot of teams. They\u2019re good at\ndrinking though, so socially they are\nup there with the best. As far as BUCS,\nI think they\u2019ll end up staying where\nthey are.\nSome of the less obvious sports\nnow. What about fencing?\nThey\u2019ll go up, I remember that last\nyear they were quite good and they\nseem to be doing the same again this\nyear.\nWhat about squash?\nThey were really good last year.\nDidn\u2019t they win some BUCS thing too?\nYeah. I think they\u2019ll do well again this\nyear.\nWhat about Orienteering?\nWhat is that?\nIt\u2019s a sport where you have to\nfind targets in various environments in the quickest time.\nSo you\u2019ve just got to be a normal human to do it. Good luck to them. Why\naren\u2019t they playing rugby?\nJust before we round up the\ninterview, we just like to ask you\nabout the social side of things.\nAs Jack and myself have pointed\nout in the paper, it\u2019s not just\nalways about the sport. With\nthat in mind, how do you balance\nplaying for the 1st XV, competing\nweek in week out and taking part\nin the social side of the rugby\nclub?\nWe don\u2019t stop anyone doing anything,\nin fact we encourage the social side of\nrugby. It is so important to bond with\nyour team mates, dress up as girls and\nthe \u2018lash\u2019. But we do say that if you miss\ntraining because your out the night be-fore, then we will come down on you.\nIt\u2019s not just me on the case, the whole\nteam has got the same mentality as no\none wants to affect the training session\nby not being there. But nobody really\ndoes that as every is pretty committed\nand everyone wants the same result.\nAlso this Saturday night there is a\ncocktail event hosted by the club in\ndB\u2019s, cheap drinks and a good time.\nAll you got to do is bring those little\numbrellas.\nfelix sports editor Mustapher Botchway and 1st XV captain James Pettit\nYes there is a snowboard team at IC, and it finally warrants a mention in felix!\nThere is a massive university\nsnowsports community in the UK,\nof which Imperial is a relatively tiny\npart of. Typically, clubs from Loughborough, Birmingham, Reading,\nManchester and even Dublin attend\nnational events with upwards of 30\nmembers (the majority of which attend\npurely for the rowdy social aspect of it\nall) whereas Imperial are lucky to send\n15 competitors. However, this number\nis growing year by year along with the\nteam\u2019s successes, prompting funding\nfrom Sport Imperial enabling more\nfrequent coaching and more consistent\nparticipation in events.\nLast weekend saw Imperial\u2019s snowboard race team come 3rd overall\nin the British University Dry slope\nChampionships (BUDS) Dual Slalom\nevent - a huge achievement amidst the\n64 participating teams especially in the\nfirst year that the competition has been\nsanctioned by British Universities and\nColleges Sport. IC Snowsports race\nteam won 10 BUCS points for Imperial\nin the sports league tables which is the\nbest success they have achieved yet.\nIn the individual competitions, Allan Bouwstra and myself, Ruskin Constant, were 37th and 41st fastest down\nthe boarders Grand Slalom course with\ntimes of 16.80 secs and 16.93 secs respectively - a formidable result against\n182 total competitors that qualified us\nfor the Boarder X race competition the\nfollowing day.\nBoarder X involves a much more difficult racecourse including jumps and\nsharp turns against another rider at\nthe same time, similar to the Olympic\nLet it snow, let it snow, let it snow!\nRuskin Constant &\nMichael Parkes\nevent that has 4 riders. It is stupidly\ndifficult even without having to worry\nabout another rider who is well within\nthe rules to \u2018nudge\u2019 you down. This led\nto a number of casualties of which fortunately there was no one from Imperial, but at least 3 hospitalities occurred\nover the weekend on the slopes.\nLast year, the snowboarding team\nwere knocked out in the first few\nrounds due to an unfair mishap where\na race official was late in signalling for\nour team to start. This year we were\nout to prove that Imperial has got\nsome major riding talent despite hailing from central London. The event\nis often dominated by students from\nUnis further north that have access\nto more of the country\u2019s dryslopes\nfor training or have a much bigger investment in sport (e.g. Loughborough\nor Bath Uni.) Beating Newcastle riders was particularly satisfying for this\nreason, especially considering we did\nnot even have enough people for a full\nteam (only 3 of the 5 that were needed)\nin my first year.\nBUDS freestyle competition plays\nhost to some major figures on the UK\nsnowboard scene; the likes of which\nprovoke other amateur snowriders to\nattempt the craziest of stunts in order\nto gain respect on the slopes. Despite\nnot being recognised by BUCS as an\nofficial competition, freestyle still attracts at least a 100 competitors each\ntime and this year was no exception.\nThere\u2019s a Big Air contest (massive\njump with massive tricks) and a Slopestyle contest (big air plus rails.)\nTim Burton (freestyle captain) and\nTom Britton represented Imperial on\nskis \u2013 notably throwing down a switch\n180 and a dodgy somersault respectively in the slopestyle.\nOn snowboard, Jamie Perrelet made\nit through to the final round of the big\nair contest on the strength of a solid\n360 landed with style and panache.\nIt\u2019s also worth mentioning here that\nImperial College is still host to the\nBUISC female freestyle champion Ces\nO\u2019Hanlon from last year.\nBUDS takes place at the Midlothian\nski centre in Hillend just outside of\nEdinburgh and is always a memora-ble/terrifying experience. The ski race\nis held over 2 days on the biggest dry\nslope in Europe, which winds its way\ndown a mountain on the outskirts of\nEdinburgh. Not only do the competitors have to brace themselves for the\ncold windy weather of Scotland, they\nalso have to ski down a very steep\nDendex slope riddled with bumps and\npatches of grass. You may ask yourself\nthe question \u201cwhy do this?\u201d but every\nyear thousands of university students\nturn up to try and prove who is the\nfastest or craziest skier in the land and,\nImperial is no exception.\n2008 saw the largest BUDS ever,\nwith 1350 people attending, including\n450 male and 250 female competitors\nentered in both individual slalom and\ngiant slalom events. This made this\nyear\u2019s races very competitive. However\nthe ski team rose to the challenge with\nindividual members setting some excellent times. Charles Hudson, Alexander Davenport and Michael Parkes all\nfinished within the top 90 fastest men\nin both slalom and GS events.\nIn true Imperial style the team took\nonly one girl to compete, however\nMarianne Rolph did very well narrowly missing out on making the top\n30 girls.\nOne skier on the Grand Slalom\nneeded airlifting out with a helicopter\nafter over an hour of treatment on the\nslope itself. The incident had a massive knock-on effect to the remainder\nof the ski competitions, which culminated in the ski team dual slaloms\nbeing effectively cancelled. Instead,\nthe top 16 universities were picked to\nbattle it out based on the individual\nresults from the previous day, leaving\nout our ski team. (BUCS regulations\nstipulate that a Champion University\nhad to be decided that weekend, which\nis why the competition was not simply\nrescheduled.)\nOn the whole, the snowsports team\nhas already improved a lot this year\nwith all of the newest members showing massive improvements having attended regular training and, now with\nsolid performances at BUDS, the team\nhopes to improve and build on the\nprogress it has made.\nThe next tournament is the British Universities Indoors Snowsports\nChampionships (or BUISC) that starts\nin the New Year at indoor snow domes\nacross the country. Imperial will be\ncompeting in the southern qualifiers\nand hopefully the finals further north\nif all goes well.\nIt\u2019s not too late to get involved with\nthe race team, so if you\u2019re up for hurling\nyourself down steep slopes at breakneck speeds, dodging objects, pulling\ntricks, getting hyper on adrenaline and\nmerry with a myriad of other Universities at the some of the country\u2019s hugest\nstudent social events then let us know\nvia ski@imperial.ac.uk. Failing that,\nbook yourself onto the Imperial ski trip\nto Val Thorens in the Christmas holidays for a more concentrated dose.\nThe Women\u2019s 1st volleyball team cemented their position at the top of the\nBUCS South Eastern Conference 1A\nafter a flawless performance at the second round of tournaments at Reading\nUniversity.Theymaintainedtheir100%\nrecord, recording three more wins to\nadd to the two convincing victories the\nprevious Sunday at the University of\nKent. The women are yet to drop a set\nand have already secured their place in\nthe BUCS last sixteen playoffs.\nImperial volleyball reaching new heights\nEmanuel Balsamo They faced Reading, Sussex and\nKent and won each encounter 2-0. The\nscore lines made for impressive read-ing. 25-8 was the first set score against\na Sussex side that could not handle an\nImperial side firing on all cylinders.\nReading and Kent could not do much\nbetter as opponents struggled to reach\ndouble figures.\nThere is no question that the Imperial ladies have been training harder\nthan any other opponents and this was\nvisible as the team played as a cohesive\nunit.\nAlana played a captain\u2019s role as she\nscored point after a point from the\noutside hitting position as well as\nsome spectacular backcourt middle\nhits. Playmaker Ashly Black put on a\nmaster class of setting, distributing the\nball deceptively to keep the opposition\nblockers always guessing. Brazilian\ndefensive specialist Regina was incredibly accurate in service reception,\nfreeing Black up to execute Imperial\u2019s\nfast and exciting brand of volleyball.\nMiddle hitters Linda and Ascha were\ndominant and fast at the net, slamming\ndown Black\u2019s quick sets with immense\npower. Dynamic French phD student\nAmelie showed some deft touches as\nwell as unstoppable cross court spikes.\nFirst year Jen also impressed, particularly with a huge block in the Kent\ngame as the whole squad showed great\nfocus and team spirit to dominate all\nthree games from the beginning.\nLeft-handed and elegant attacker\nEmily Boyd was in scintillating form\nthe whole day, with Black stretching\nthe opposition blockers by setting up\nBoyd frontcourt and backcourt, and\ntime and time again her strong hits\nfound the opponents floor to keep the\nscoreboard ticking over.\nThe team are improving each game\nand so far this season have played 13\ngames in all competitions and won all\nof them, including a prestigious preseason tournament and qualification\nfor the English Volleyball Association\nStudent Cup Finals, beating Southampton University and top 8 BUCS\nranked Cambridge University along\nthe way.\nIC swimming\ntake on nation\nLast weekend IC swim club travelled\nup to Ponds Forge swimming pool\nin Sheffield to take part in the BUCS\nchampionships. It is one of the biggest\ngalas of the year, with several team GB\nand Olympic swimmers taking part.\nThe IC team did not disappoint, with\nseveral great performances, including\ntheir coach who managed to miss the\ntrain. Andrew Hagues finished 16th\nand 21st in the 50m and 100m backstroke respectively, finishing just a second outside the final in the 50m. Kent\nZheng smashed his long-standing\nPB in the 100m breaststroke, showing promise for the rest of the season.\nMatt Steere finished a brilliant 12th\nin the gruelling 1500m freestyle, with\nErika Cule and Thomas WhiteheadClarke both taking chunks out of personal best times. Performance of the\nweekend goes to the men\u2019s medley\nrelay team who despite being put together that morning took seconds off\npast times. With such good performances this early in the season, and the\nextremely young squad the club have,\nthings are looking promising for the\nmonths to come.\nThomas Whitehead-Clarke\nCaffeine overdose!!\nWho is that lucky chap in the middle?\nOn 7th November, 29 excitable lacrosse players set off for the club\u2019s 2nd\nannual tour to Oxford. The promise\nof booze, boogying, bonding, a fair\namount of fancy dress and a cheeky lacrosse match awaited us in this beautiful city. Friday saw us hitting the town\nin our uber-sexy red tour shirts. After\na round of rather lethal fish bowls to\nbreak the ice at a local cocktail bar, we\nmade our way to the student night at\nBar Risa which was in the ideal loca-tion- next door to our hostel! A great\nnight was had by all, which was evident\njudging by the horrific hangovers experienced the morning after!\nAfter a morning spent blearily exploring Oxford (seeking out coffee to\nwake us up!), we arrived at University\nParks, psyched for a highly competitive\nmatch against the Oxford University\nmixed team.\nDespite a great effort from all our\nplayers (and enough people to field\n3 teams!) we lost fairly comfortably.\nHowever, we looked upon this as a\ngreat opportunity for everyone, particularly the new players, to compete\nagainst one of the best mixed lacrosse\nteams in the country. Following a few\nfriendly pints at a local pub with our\nrivals, we returned to don our jungle\nthemed fancy dress in preparation for\nthe second evening of debauchery.\nOutfits ranged from leopards to trees\nwith varying success and levels of na-kedness. We even had our very own\n\u2018snow leopard\u2019 made from a children\u2019s\nfurry dalmation outfit?!\nAfter a cosy team curry we made our\nway to Clementine\u2019s for more drinking and more dancing. Unfortunately\ngetting caught in a huge rain storm\non the way was a bit of a disaster for\nthose wearing face paint! The rain did\nnot dampen our spirits however as we\ndanced the night away to such cheesy\nclassics as the \u2018Macarena\u2019.\nSunday saw the club drag itself out\ninto Oxford once more for tour fines\nand a pub lunch before we headed\nback to London broken but satisfied.\nA weekend of drunken carnage was\nover\u2026until next year..!\nLacrosse tour to Oxford\nEmanuel Balsamo\nThe mixed lacrosse team at Oxford\n\n"

Geek has had enough of Imperial Girl\nD\near guys at felix, and everyone else. I hope this\nis both the first and last\narticle I write here, and\nI\u2019m pretty aware of my\nfamily\u2019s history when it comes to letters of complaint, but I was left completely and utterly appalled at the content of felix last week. Not only was\nit filled with language a sailor would\nhave trouble keeping up with, but a lot\nof the content was just pointless rants.\nYou see, I was on the bus home from\nImperial on Friday night, and as it did\nits random \u201cThis bus is being held here\nin order to regulate the service\u201d thing,\nand with passengers beginning to com-plain, I thought that a one-to-one with\nmy felix newspaper would give me a\nrest from the impatient, unappreciative company I had the misfortune of\nbeing with. But when I opened the\nnewspaper, I was faced with just the\nsame; students ranting about hospital\nwaiting times, amount of work they\nhave, petitions, and even about ranting\nitself (but am I just ranting about ranting about ranting, or as an imperial\nstudent would put it: Ranting cubed?)\nThe thing that I was most appalled\nwith was the amount of spelling and\ngrammatical mistakes made by the\nhigh-standard students that we supposedly are. There is no such phrase\nin the English language such as \u201cI could\nof\u201d; it\u2019s \u201cI could HAVE\u201d! And we aren\u2019t\nin America, so \u201cdefense\u201d is spelt with\nImperial Girl loves Winter romance, hint, hint\nS\neriously,I can see you reading\nthis right now and it makes\nme feel good. Actually it was\nthe other day that I saw another girl reading my column\nin the Library Cafe, and I just got this\nwarm fuzzy feeling. A little bit like the\none you get when you\u2019ve drunk too\nmuch alcohol.\nI am loving this time of year. The\nwinter is fast approaching and the\nthought of getting cosy with a loved\none while it\u2019s cold and snowing outside\nis incredible.

Okay Christmas, NYE, Valentine\u2019s\nday... you need to get the guy now for\noptimum efficiency.\u2028\u2028I just love the feeling of being held close. You know, like\nwhen you are waiting for the bus and\nit\u2019s cold and he\u2019s got his arms around\nyou keeping you warm. And when you\nare walking and you take your hand\nout of your pocket and he just grabs\nthem and holds them close in his... My\ngosh! I am so soppy today! Let me go\non: When he offers you his scarf when\nyou say you\u2019re feeling the chill, when\nyou drink hot choco in front of the TV\nat night, when he.... boys i hope you\nare taking notes - I\u2019m not dropping\nhints for nothing! Boys and Girls, we\nall know the 2 commandments. Thou\nshalt have fun in the time of High Sun\n(aka Summer). Thou shalt giveth your\ncommitment(eth) in the time of the\nHIgh Moon (aka winter).\nSummer is for fun. Winter is for those\nrelationships.\u2028\u2028Otherthingsiloveabout\nwinter is how everything around you\nseems so much more clearer. It\u2019s like\nthe crisp cold sharpens your eyesight.\nWhen you\u2019re walking down the same\nroad you do every morning to get to\ncollege, you suddenly realise the beautiful archeitecture. The other thing i\nnotice is that girls make more effort to\nstyle their clothes. The other day i saw\na girl whose hair look like she walked\nstriaght out of a Loreal hair-colour ad-vert, and she was wearing this turqoise\nwinter cap. Oh so gorgeous. And i love\nthese new tights girls around campus\nare wearing with boots. \u2028\u2028I like the way\nthe sky turns that pinky blue colour\naround 5.30pm. The smokey clouds\nthat veil the bright full moon. The way\nthe leaves fall in spiralling motion off\nthe trees. The christmas songs and gift\nadverts that come on TV. Hmm. Winter is here soon my friends.\n.....but but but before I leave you, I\nwould like to take this opportunity to\naddress some of the responses to the\narticles I have received over the past\ncouple of weeks. Apologies if I haven\u2019t\nresponded to your emails, please know\nthat I read everything that is sent. One\nemailer who will remain anonomous\nquite elegantly commented, \u201cWomen\nlike yourself are having a hard time\nworking out the right balance between\nbeing a successful woman and an desirable woman. Unfortuantely, while\nwomen go for successful men, men are\nput off by successful women\u201d - and it\ncouldn\u2019t be truer. When I was around\nthe age of 16/17 I forcibly pretended\nto be a bimbo around people especially guys. Showing a guy that you are\nheadstrong doesn\u2019t always bode well.\nSo here\u2019s my modified tactic at univer-sity. Step 1: Don\u2019t make obvious to the\nguy you like that you are headstrong or\nany other strong personality traits that\nyou may possess. Step 2: figure out if\nyou like him and if he can fit well with\nyour personality. Step 3: if the answer\nis positive from Step 2, slowly lure him\ninto understanding who you are. This\nway you\u2019ll only be revealing yourself\nto promising candidate, hence being\nmore efficient. Gosh i love efficiency\ntoday... I must have turned German.\nAnd to the article written by Anon\nto my first column that wrote \u201cImperial Girl is a Geek like the rest of us\u201d I\nfound it really hard to follow your argument or views. I am not entirely sure\nwhat I was reading, not in an offensive\nway of course... Let me know, IG (Im-perialGirl@ic.ac.uk)\na C! No decent person would take an\nargument seriously if it contained such\nbasic flaws. And another thing, to the\ngirl who had the decency of bl*nking\nout part of the F-word in her article, at\nleast put in the correct number of as-terisks! (But maybe I\u2019m just nitpicking\nwith that one.)\nSo, I know that felix readers everywhere will be scrutinizing every word\nof this article to say \u201cAha! I got you Mr.\nspelling man with OCD!\u201d Firstly, go\nahead (you won\u2019t find any!), and sec-ond, I\u2019m just trying to remind everyone that spell-checks do exist! But I do\nknow that there are also terrible examples out there on the streets of London;\ntake \u201cSt. James\u2019s Park\u201d for instance. I\nthink that\u2019s one of the few cases where\ngraffiti on a sign should be legal. So re-ally, the way we can improve society as\na whole is not to just focus only on our-selves, but on the small things in life,\nlike spelling for God\u2019s sake!\nBut on the other hand, maybe student life is so hectic that we haven\u2019t got\ntime to check our spellings, just get the\nmessage out there! So yeah, keep up\nthe good work felix guys! Anyway I\u2019m\noff to complain to the council about the\npresence of lollipop ladies (or \u201cschool\ncrossing patrollers\u201d to be more PC) at\npelican crossings.

Do docs really just stick their\nfingers where the sun-don\u2019t-shine as\nsoon as you enter the room? Hell no.\nMedicine as a profession would cease\nto exist if that was common practice,\nfor you would sue it for every penny.\nJust last week, I got chatting to a girl\non the train and she thought a visit to\nthe doctors involved having every orifice violated for a lollipop.

In\nfact, there were more mistakes\nthan I\u2019d normally like there to\nbe. Over the past week I have\nreceived several complaints about the\nspelling and grammar, incorrect maps\nand general shoddiness. For all the\nabove, I apologise, yet at the same time\nI am thankful.\nThe number of complaints we received is clearly a sign that you lot are\nreading what we print each week, and\nthat you all have a certain standard you\nexpect the paper to reach. It is for those\nreasons that I thank you all for emails.\nAt the same time, I feel that I need to\nexplain what exactly happened to result\nin such an epic fail, which I made jokes\nabout on the front page! The network\non which the paper runs decided to\nthrow its toys out of the pram and not\nco-operate with us, and it decided to\ndo this on Wednesday, which the regular contributors out there will know, is\nvery, very close to our print deadline.\nWhat resulted was a frantic rush to\nthe finish line, with pages being passed\naround on USB sticks and many photographs and files subsequently going\nmissing. As a result, several pages were\nnot printed: for which I apologise to\nmy section editors and their contribu-tors. Because of the lack of a network,\nour copy editors were not able to look\nat each page efficiently and so errors\nwere bound to slip past them.\nSo there you go. Yes it was a poor\nissue, but at least it was an issue and\nlike I said, it showed us that you guys\nclearly do read it and you really want a\ngood quality newspaper.\nWith that in mind, you may have noticed that there have been a few changes to the appearance of the paper. Most\nof all in this, the comment section. We\nthink it looks more modern and more\nstylish. We think that it works but if\nyou think it doesn\u2019t, then please let us\nknow by email or in person.\nNext week\u2019s issue should be a good\none too (fingers crossed) as it is the\nGuardian Students Media Awards. fe-lix, I, science, Live! and Angry Geek are\nall nominated in various categories and\nwe will report on the outcome, hopefully with some lovely trophies.\nOh and phoenix is out!

Now the media is filled\nwith stories written by lay people who\nhave never been to the doctors. Just the\nother week, I read that smoking reduces your chance of getting some obscure\nsyndrome Z. Yeah it might do according to an equally obscure study, where\nall subjects died from every other disease under the sun because they never\ngot old enough to get syndrome Z.\nIt\u2019s this type of junk in the media that\ndrives me crazy. It\u2019s this type of junk\nthat always appears in newspapers\nthat require the literacy of a five year\nold. Then what really hacks me off is\nA\nllow me to nip this one\nin the bud right now:\nImperial Girl, before the\nweeks drag on and felix becomes an in-print\nedition of Loose Women. You have is-sues. I appreciate this \u2013 I think we all\ndo, deep down. But you need to see\nsomeone, before you really damage\npeople other than yourself. I mean, we\nall read felix. The more you write, the\nhigher the possibility that some of us\nmay read what you\u2019re putting out. One\nstray glance, one look at a sentence\nwritten on the other side of the world\nmap section, and kapow! Central nervous system shuts down, and they\u2019re out\nlike a light. Three of my friends are still\nin a coma from last week. They were\nall male, of course. The female ones\nhave formed a militia with the intent of\nmurdering you in your sleep.\nI think the reason I\u2019m taking such an\nissue with you is that you\u2019re obsessed\nwith this notion that you speak for\nall women. I find this problematic for\ntwo reasons. First of all, you use it as\nan excuse to speak to Allmen. Allmen\nis a fictional race of people created\nby that weird teacher you had at your\nold school with seven ex-husbands,\nthat you kind of respected but only\nwhen she wasn\u2019t creeping you out with\nasymmetric makeup and the face of a\nwoman hit with the hangover mallet.\n\u201cAllmen are bastards.\u201d She\u2019d slur. And\nmentally, subconsciously maybe, you\nwere taking notes.\nThe second reason, of course, is that\nyou don\u2019t speak for all women any more\nthan Harold Shipman speaks for all\ndoctors. The fact that you can smash\na keyboard slightly better than an infinite number of monkeys at a typewriter doesn\u2019t mean that you have the\nforce of every Imperial woman behind\nyou. And even if you did, it\u2019d hardly be\nsomething to be proud of.\nAnyway. To the present day. You\u2019re\nfinding things tough at Imperial, and\nthat\u2019s fair enough. The other day I had\nto have a conversation with someone\nwearing a leather jacket. We all have to\nmake sacrifices to study at an institution like this, I guess. The reason I hate\nyou is because you\u2019re one of those people who just can\u2019t stand to be a geek.\nYou just physically can\u2019t bring yourself\nto do it. It scares you so much that\nyou\u2019d much rather truss yourself up\nin your whorehouse best and stagger\naround London on heels higher than\nyour sense of self-importance.\nAnd I\u2019m not someone who thinks\neveryone should strap themselves into\na lab coat and enjoy the ride here, I just\nthink that if you\u2019re the kind of girl who\ngoes out to clubs wearing outfits that\na nudist would consider revealing, and\ncomplains when boys you like don\u2019t\nlike you back \u2013 a sob story worthy of\nHannah Montana, indeed \u2013 then you\nshould just be up front about it. You\nshouldn\u2019t claim one week that, gosh\ndarn it, people are so superficial, and\nthen the next describe your \u201cfuck-me\npumps\u201d, a phrase so stupendously awful that I can\u2019t bear to even add it to my\nword processor\u2019s dictionary.\nPeople at Imperial, on the whole, are\nunhappy with who they are. It\u2019s a real-ly, genuinely terrible affliction and it\u2019s\nsomething they should aim to change\nat once. You can\u2019t blame a university for\ncausing it. You can\u2019t bemoan a work-ethic and a scientific regime for turning you into a mentally-imbalanced\nprostitute in the evenings. That\u2019s just\nwho you are. Imperial is your day job,\nit doesn\u2019t define you as a human be-ing. And if you decide that that person\nyou\u2019ve become isn\u2019t what you\u2019d like,\nthen you\u2019ve got an impetus to change\nit. An excuse is not a way out. Especially if it\u2019s as feeble as IG\u2019s.\nIf anyone else is reading this, following Imperial Girl\u2019s passages of wisdom\nlike they\u2019re a new season of Sex and\nthe City, then I implore you \u2013 just look\nat yourself and try to be someone you\nrespect. Because at the end of the day,\nthis godforsaken university and all of\nthe fashionista arseholes will one day\nbe behind you.

Errrr, see\nthe funny thing is Doctor, I\u2019m coughing up blood, what do you think that\u2019s\nabout?\u201d Well, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s because\nof the excessive dietary spinach intake.\nA common misconception is that\ndoctors sometimes get things wrong;\ntherefore we should not believe what\nthey say. They are only human after all.\nSo I\u2019m not going to take the blood pressure tablets because they might kill me.\nOK, let\u2019s investigate it then.

The funny thing is, in\nthe face of such stupidity, doctors must\nstill be civil, calm and professional.\nNow my beloved engineers, if your clients ask you stupid questions and say\nabsurd intellectually challenged things\nto you too many times to count, can\nyou act in a civil manner? Or would\nyou lose it? Well doctors can\u2019t do that\nyou see. They need to hold onto their\nsanity and be empathetic, which in\nmedical terms requires doctors to understand how intellectually deficient\nsome patients can be and respect their\nwishes. One other thought, maybe\nthat\u2019s why they are called patients; you\nneed a lot of patience.\nAs this article draws to a close, one\nmust say that although the preceding\nviews were strong, they are close to the\ntruth. Sometimes the truth is the most\nastonishing piece of information. But\nthe bottom line is, the majority of patients are people undergoing suffering\nand deserve care and attention. It is a\nfine art to distinguish those who are ill\nfrom those who think they are ill, a skill\nunique to the medical profession and\nperhaps justifies the high costs of producing a doctor. Remember, the next\ntime you go to see your doc, have a\nlittle trust and believe that maybe, just\nmaybe, he or she will heal you without\na finger up the\u2026\nDon\u2019t worry, this Doctor is 100% above board... hot too\n\n"

Though they existed for only\nfive years and made only four studio\nalbums, this quartet of Mancunians\nshaped the sound of the 1980s and still\ninspire bands today. Morrissey and\nJohnny Marr, the undisputed Lennon\nand McCartney of their decade, had\na love-hate relationship that would\nultimately lead to the demise of The\nSmiths in 1987.\nSteven Patrick Morrissey was the\nlyricist of the songwriting duo. His\ngenius as a wordsmith (or perhaps\nwordSmith) was born out of his somewhat peculiar puberty. In his teen years\nat the tail-end of the 1970s he spent\nmuch of his time alone in his bedroom,\nreading Oscar Wilde, dreaming about\nJames Dean and listening to music.\nHe worshipped many idols during this\ntime \u2013 mostly writers, actors and singers from the 50s and 60s \u2013 all of whom\nwould shape the sound and style of The\nSmiths between 1983 and 1987.\nJohnny Marr wrote the music. Four\nyears younger than Morrissey, Marr\nwas a wizard on guitar. His forever\nmemorable riffs, which echoed the\njingly-jangly guitar music of sixties\nbands such as the Byrds and the Kinks,\nhave inspired everyone from Oasis to\nRadiohead. Legend has it that some of\nthe Smiths\u2019 riffs are so complex, even\nMarr can no longer play them. It was\npurely by chance that Moz and Marr\nmet in the dreary setting of grey, rainy\nManchester during the early years of\nthe Thatcher government, bonded by\ntheir love of music and their desire to\nbe Big.\nThe Smiths have an almost timeless quality. They made music in the\nmid-eighties but some of their songs\nsound like ditties from the sixties (\u2018Ask\u2019,\n\u2018Panic\u2019, \u2018Girlfriend in a Coma\u2019), while\nothers have a seventies-style punkish\nedge to them (\u2018Sweet and Tender Hooligan\u2019, \u2018London\u2019, \u2018Shakespeare\u2019s Sister\u2019).\nThey were at their best when they effortlessly combined sweet sixties-style\nguitar melodies with harsh and frequently comical lyrics about life in the\neighties. \u201cI\u2019m not sure what happiness\nmeans / But I look into your eyes / And\nI know that it isn\u2019t there\u201d, sings Morrissey on the tragic but beautiful \u2018Jeane\u2019,\na song that sounds like it could have\nbeen No.1 in 1963, if it\u2019s lyrics weren\u2019t\nabout bedsit life in Thatcher\u2019s rundown Britain of 1983. It is fitting that\nSandie Shaw, the barefoot girl singer of\nthe 1960s, did a cover version of this\nSmiths classic.\nIt is this mix of a sixties sensibility\nwith eighties observations that makes\nthe sound of the Smiths so attractive.\nIn many ways, the Smiths represented a\nretreat from the eighties into nostalgia\nfor 1960s Britain. So they eschewed the\nsynthesised robotic nonsense of 1980s\npop music (Morrissey said he waved\nflowers around as a sign of humanity\namidst New Romantic dross) by creating a strictly guitar-based sound. And\neach of their single and album covers\nfeatured a black-and-white shot from\na classic sixties film: snapshots of a\nbygone era when men were men, and\nwomen didn\u2019t wear tonnes of glitter\nand leg-warmers.\nWhile they existed, the Smiths represented a form of escapism from eighties Britain. Morrissey captured perfectly the sense of doom in that period\nwhen he sang on \u2018Shoplifters of the\nWorld Unite\u2019: \u201cLast night the plans for\na future war / Were all I saw on Channel Four.\u201d By the mid-1980s, Thatcher\nhad taken Britain well and truly from\nthe \u2018Politics of Consensus\u2019 of the postwar 1960s era into a time of open class-conflict and mass unemployment. She\nlaunched open warfare on the trade\nunions (smashing the miners in 1984),\nlowered wages, pursued an increasingly ruthless war in Northern Ireland,\nand made millions unemployed.\nIn many ways, Thatcher represented\nan anti-sixties mentality: she frequently attacked the liberal, druggy culture\nthat was supposedly unleashed by the\nsixties counterculture and sought to\nreplace the relative prosperity of life in\n1960s Britain with new forms of austerity and control more suited to the\n1980s. It is not surprising then that\nMorrissey (the anti-Thatcher who in\n1988 would record a song called \u2018Margaret on the Guillotine\u2019) embraced the\nsound, feel and smell of the sixties as\na refreshing alternative to eighties\nShane O\u2019Neill\nAlbum Review\nThe Smiths\nSound of The Smiths\nRhino\nHHHHI\nBritain. In many ways, Morrissey vs.\nThatcher, the beauty of the Smiths\u2019\nsound vs. the ugliness of Thatcher\u2019s\ngrey Britain, represented a major cultural clash between old-fashioned\nBritish values of solidarity and fair play\nand the new destructive British values\nof conflict and defeat.\nThe Smiths summed up well the\npointlessness of life in eighties Britain\non \u2018Heaven Knows I\u2019m Miserable Now\u2019.\nMorrissey sang: \u201cI was looking for a job\nand then I found a job / And heaven\nknows I\u2019m miserable now.\u201d It is striking\nthat the cover of this single featured a\npicture of the blonde bouffant-sporting\nViv Nicholson, who became a household name in Britain in 1961 after she\nwon the lottery and spent a fortune\non fast cars and fur coats. Again, the\nSmiths seemed to contrast miserable\nBritain in 1983 with the sense of possibility and vision that existed in 1961.\nSome people call it nostalgia, but I\ncall it escapism. And what is pop mu\u201cThe Smiths\nsummed up well\nthe pointlessness\nof life in the 80s.\u201d\nsic about if not escapism? The Smiths\nmanaged better than any band before\nor since to sweep the listener off their\nfeet and into more pleasant surroundings with their searing three-minute\nsongs. The music made you smile and\nthe lyrics made you laugh. Today, by\ncontrast, we are surrounded by worth-less, boring bands who insist we must\nwallow in the sorrow of the world\nrather than escape it. If the likes of U2\nor Coldplay could stop making dull\n\u201cprotest songs\u201d or patronising \u201cworld\nmusic\u201d for just one minute, and instead\nallow us to rise above the daily grind,\nwell, as Morrissey would say, \u201cI\u2019d get\nsuch a shock I\u2019d probably jump in the\nocean!\u201d\nSo in this time of global financial\ncrisis and political unease, my advice\nis to \u201cBoot the grime of this world in\nthe crotch, dear / And don\u2019t go home\ntonight, come out and find\u201d the Smiths\n\u2013 and perhaps escape reality for a song\nor two.\n\u201cKeates and Yates are on your side, while weird-lover Wilde is on mine\u201d music.felix <3 Morrissey\nSteven Burgess\nAlbum Review\nMurcof\nThe Versailles Sessions\nThe Leaf Label\nHHIII\nOnce upon a midnight dreary, while I\npondered weak and weary/ suddenly\nthere came a tapping, as if someone\ngently rapping, rapping at my chamber\ndoor. The arrival of Murcof\u2019s (a.k.a.\nFernando Corona\u2019s) debut album\nMartes in 2002 was credited with establishing the genre of classically influenced electronic music, layering\nrecordings, clipped beats and acoustic\ninstruments to create vast minimalist soundscapes. Since then Corona\u2019s\nwork has become steadily more experimental and in 2007 he took time out\nfrom recording to work on a commission for Les Grandes Eaux Nocturnes\nfestival at the Chateau de Versailles in\nFrance. Held annually it is a celebration of sound, light and water in the\nhistoric palatial gardens of French aristocracy and the Versailles Sessions\nare the product of six pieces prepared\nespecially for the event.\nOpen here I flung the shutter, when,\nwith many a flirt and flutter/ In there\nstepped a stately raven of saintly days of\nyore. This is best considered as a piece\nof sound art as it dispenses almost\nentirely with melody and traditional\nstructure and is unusual even by electronic standards. All sounds were built\nup with recordings of 17th century Baroque instruments later moulded, per-verted, subverted and distorted into a\nghostly display. With phantom fingers\ngiving a combination of conventional\nand experimental instrumental per-formances, low growls rumble from\ntortured souls in the bowels of purga-tory, generating the nightmarish quality of a Gothic novel.\nGhastly grim and ancient raven\nwandering from the nightly shore \u2013\ntell me what thy lordly name is on the\nnight\u2019s Plutonian shore! With piercing\nflutes and plucked strings the fascinating opener \u2018Welcome to Versailles\u2019\nsmolders like a Chinese burn, but\nrarely are such heights reached again.\nLouis XIV\u2019s Demons is a stop\nand start burst of shrill\nviolins reverberated and\nreversed, anticipating the future chase of\na doomed monarch\ninto the shadows of\nMadame Guillotine.\nAlthough at times gripping in its textural richness the overriding impression of the album\nis one of monotony, the\ntheme not not develop far\nbeyond a tense, menacing\nmilieu.\nThen, methought the\nair grew denser,\nperfumed from\nan unseen censer. Like most sound art\nthe tracks (particularly the 12 minute\nlong Spring In the Artificial Gardens)\nthe sessions are drawn out, a conscious\ndecision acknowledged by Corona who\nafter viewing the venue decided the\ncompositions needed \u201cmore time for\nthe sounds to develop and...resonate in\nthat big space\u201d, subsequently reworking the piece before the\nperformance. However\nwhen commissions are\ndisplaced from their\nsetting into audio\nformat this extended progression can\nseem lethargic,\nand the singular\npace of development of each track\nbecomes tired.\n\u201cProphet!\u201d said\nI, \u201cThing of evil!\u2014\nprophet still, if bird\nor devil!\u201d In the end\none can only guess at\nthe whole effect of the\nin situ performance - it\nis likely the throbbing base tones that\nunderpin this release would have correlated well with the rise and fall of\nfountains and the fraught development\nmatching the nocturnal light display.\nHowever the Versailles Sessions are a\nperfect example of how live performances do not always take to recording\n- an effect compounded by the site specific nature of compositions. The result\nis like watching a film without the pic-ture, football without the crowd, Poe\nwithout the poetry.\n\u201cTell me \u2013 tell me I implore!\u201d All\nsaid and done the Versailles Sessions\ndo suggest an enticing prospect when\nMurcof starts his first major UK tour\nin November. He will be premiering his new work Oceano, composed\nin collaboration with Spanish classical ensemble BCN216 and the visual\nsculptor Flicker. If well crafted audio\nvisual performances are your thing you\nshould definitely go check out his performance in London later this month,\nbut as an album - the Versailles Sessions should perhaps be considered\n-- nevermore.\nSusan Yu\nDuncan Casey\nL\neonard Cohen played across\nthe road at the Albert Hall\nlast Monday and Tuesday,\nbut I could not afford to\ngo. Leonard Cohen spent 5\nyears in a Zen Buddhist monastery on\ntop of a mountain in L.A. from 1994 to\n1999. I have spent the last week or so\ndisillusioned by the last two sentences\n- Leonard Cohen not only spent half of\nthe 90s being mental in that disgraceful\nwealthy American celebrity way, but he\nalso charges extortionate, arena-rock\namounts of money too see him play.\nSo I thought I\u2019d slate him a bit. \u201cHere\nyou go you overrated, wrinkled, de-pressed, depressing old schmuck, try\nthis on for size. Your music brings no\nhappiness to no-one. Nothing but mis-ery, failed relationships, bad sex, bad\nbreath and bad grammar ever came\nout of listening to any of your songs.\u201d\nI could say something like that. Then\nI could go on Wikipedia and get some\nreferences and take the piss out of\nthem whilst framing myself as intellectually superior because I didn\u2019t spend 5\nyears being mental in a Zen Buddhist\nmonastery in L.A. (racism waiver: not\na comment on Buddhists, just people\nwho become Buddhist after making\nloads of money and going mental). A\nprevious musical and lyrical hero of\nmine would lie slain on the ground,\nego reduced to dust, and I would stand\ntriumphant, feeling slightly empty and\ndirty but on the whole pretty good\nabout myself.\nAndthat\u2019swhatItriedtodothisweek,\nPeter Sinclair\nMusic Editor\nbut as you can see it didn\u2019t really work\nout. After reading some interviews and\nsome Wikipedias, I made the discovery that despite having jumped on the\n\u2018celebrities who find religion after decades of drug use\u2019 bandwagon, Leonard\nCohen is still an ace songwriter and, for\na 67-year-old, a pretty cool guy. He still\nwrote \u2018So Long, Marianne\u2019 and \u2018Sisters\nof Mercy\u2019, and he still chain smokes. He\nmay have lost his characteristic sense\nof cultural cynicism and powerlessness which permeated the majority of\nhis work (he\u2019s Zen now, remember?),\nbut the black gallows humour has re-mained, and I think has even been enhanced in recent years. \u201cI think there\u2019s\na laugh a minute\u201d he said in a recent\ninterview, in reference to his lyrics.\nAnd faster than you can say \u2018After\nSchool Special\u2019, a moral lesson was\nlearnt. It\u2019s all too easy to judge celebrities by the standards we live by, but\nyou\u2019ve got to remember the cultural\ndivide which is being straddled every\ntime a judgement is made. I could\nprobably say something about most\npeople in the music industry for being\nmental in one way or another, but the\njudgement would be through the preconceptions of a 20-year-old middle-class English male so it would be pretty\nmuch meaningless, and all but impossible to conceive the mentality which\nmotivates so many of the entertainment industry\u2019s finest towards such\nspiritually eccentric ends. My message\nis one of tolerance, my friends, so c\u2019est\nla vie - let the Kabbalah scrolls roll.\nAn apology to\nLeonard Cohen\nThe waiting is Snover\nSusan Yu likes what she hears with Snow Patrol\u2019s latest album.\nWill this band\u2019s snow plough of success ever snow down?\nOn the look out for some snow: \u201cI seen some, boss\u201d \u201cWell don\u2019t just stand there, MELT IT\u201d\nAlbum Review\nSnow Patrol\nA Hundred Million Suns\nPolydor\nHHHHI\nSnow Patrol are one of the hottest selling UK bands in the last few years, and\nthey have now released their eagerly\nawaited 5th studio album A Hundred\nMillion Suns, which is a great followup to the 2006 number one explosive\nextraordinaire that was Eyes Open\nwhich sold a staggering 4.5 million\ncopies across the globe. Without any\ndoubts whatsoever, Snow Patrol are\namong the elite group of artists that\nhave achieved the peak, reaching the\nmany times platinum status with their\nprevious albums Eyes Open and Final\nStraw. Notably, the outstanding single\n\u2018Chasing Cars\u2019 has just received its 2\nmillionth download in the U.S. and its\n100,000th UK radio play. With their incredible success, this band has a lot to\nlive up to. So now, is it any wonder that\nthere is a lot of hype and tremendous\nanticipation surrounding the release of\nthis new album? Nope. Even the frontman Gary Lightbody has something to\nsay on this: \u201cI\u2019m so proud of this record.\nEverybody played out of their skin.\nMusically, lyrically and sonically the\nbest record we\u2019ve made.\u2019 Let our ears\nand hearts be the judge of this one.\u201d\nThe album breaks away with a rocket indeed. \u201cA fire a fire, you can only\ntake what you can carry/ A pulse, your\npulse, it\u2019s the only thing I can remember\u201d. The first track, \u2018IF There\u2019s a Rocket\nTie Me To It\u2019, has a cracking tune with\nequally powerful lyrics, alluding to self\ndestruction, loss, and holding onto the\nfaint traces of someone dear.\nSimilarly, \u2018Crack the Shutters\u2019 follows\nthe magic formula of the somewhat\ncalm verse which gets catapulted onto\nthe surging, skyscraping chorus with\nthe drums kicking in and laying down\nthe pulsating beats.\n\u2018Take Back the City\u2019 is their most\nrecent single that was released last\nmonth, which has a grand video to go\nwith it as well. Shot in East London,\nthese guys have Alex Courtes to thank\nfor it, the magician behind The White\nStripes\u2019 sizzling \u2018Seven Nation Army.\u2019\nOne of the standout tracks from this\nalbum is \u2018Lifeboat,\u2019 which seems to say\n\u201cHold on, hold on\u201d. Snow Patrol knows\nhow to get a swanky groove going. This\nlaidback treasure has a slinky rhythm\nwith the coquettish violin hook in the\nchorus. Dangerously catchy.\n\u2018The Golden Floor\u2019 is defined by its\nuse of minimalism and lilting rhythm,\nheld together by a repeated guitar\nmotif and skittering beats. The pace\naccelerates in \u2018Please Just Take These\nPhotos,\u2019 with the constant under layer\nof guitar strumming whilst \u2018Set Down\nYour Glass\u2019 shifts again in the structure and makeup of the soundscape,\ndiverging to a smooth, soothingly light\nnumber which almost has a Sigur Ros\nfeel. The acoustic guitar in this track is\nthe vocal\u2019s best friend. Seemingly timid\nand sweet in texture and sound, the\ndelicate atmosphere is complemented\nby the tender, flawless vocalization of\nLightbody\u2019s husky serenade, producing\na winning ballad as a result.\nThroughout the course of the 11\ntracks, Lightbody (vocals/guitar) sings\nwith unabashed sincerity and emo-tion. This album is definitely one to be\nexperienced.\nSnow Patrol vocalist Alex Hogan playing guitar hero\nToo much love these days\nI have to say, I\u2019d hoped for more when\nI picked up Hate Gallery\u2019s debut offer-ing. I was never expecting anything\nbig or clever - with titles like \u2018Good\nThings Come to Those Who Hate\u2019, it\nwasn\u2019t seeming likely from the start.\nStill, considering the pedigree of some\nof the band-members the whole album\nfeels a bit paint-by-numbers \u2013 three\nchord metal repetes and lyrics from\nthe Oasis school of song writing (i.e.\nmake it rhyme) with angsty lyrics about\nfighting things.\nThat said, if you don\u2019t listen to the\nlyrics and turn the volume up, it\u2019s not\nbad. The whole album clocks in at a\nshade over half an hour, with the effect of the punky three-minute rock\nsongs amplified by the nice trick of\nleaving about half a second\u2019s pause between songs to give a staccato feel to\nthe whole recording. It\u2019s apparent in\nplaces that the band own more than a\ncouple of Mot\u00f6rhead albums between\nthem: \u2018You Don\u2019t Know\u2019 borrows heavily from \u2018Ace of Spades\u2019, although there\u2019s\nnothing much wrong with that. It\u2019s\nalso not as heavy as you\u2019d expect from\nthe unnecessarily Emo leanings of the\ntitle: if anything, it\u2019s a bit radio-friendly\nin places, although they\u2019ve thrown in\njust enough swear-words to keep the\nfifteen-year-old rockers happy.\nAlbum Review\nHate Gallery\nCompassion Fatigue\nUNIT\nHHIII\nOverall it\u2019s quite good fun, although\nI wouldn\u2019t necessarily rush out and buy\nit when it\u2019s released on November 3rd.\nInstead, keep an eye on the gig listings\nand see if they come to town \u2013 if they\ncan translate some of the manic energy\nof the recording into their live shows,\nthey could well be worth banging your\nhead to.\n\u201cThey\u2019ve thrown\nin just enough\nswearing to keep\nthe 15 year old\nrockers happy.\u201d\n\n"

This is not\nout of sheer laziness or some sort of\nmegalomaniac desire to appear like a\nbig-shot writer to anyone who might\nwalk into my room while I fervidly\ntype away. The real reason is that I am\nrather drunk, and I apologise quite unreservedly should this column read like\na bunch of gobblydeedoo. I am drunk\nbecause I just came back from a very\ngood dinner with, incidentally, a very\ngood friend.\nTonight\u2019s events made me come back\nto some thoughts I had a few years\nago at a dinner in Oxford with some\nfriends. The act of eating tends to be\nseen (especially by students) as single-purposed. Not passing out of hunger\nseems to be the main motivator for\na majority of the population to eat.\nSurvival is without doubt a relatively\nunderstandable and not totally ignoble reason, but I wish the paradigm\nfor food was wildly different, at least\namongst a young crowd. While it may\nseem strange, I enjoy thinking of eating and dining as an extension to the\nconcept of preservation.\nIf we think about it candidly, we may\ncome to the somewhat abstract but\nparamount idea that one of life\u2019s aims\nis to preserve. Preservation in a way\ndescribes the evolved state of the Human Being. In every one of our lives,\nin what Aristotle describes as an anag-norisis (a moment of recognition if you\nwill), we eventually realise this and set\nTake the parents out\nPlaces that\u2019ll kill your overdraft, but mum and dad can afford\nVirginia Woolf\nknows best\nupon maintaining and preserving the\nsmall things that define every single\none of us. These can be anything from\nthe preservation of memories past, experiences or values we choose to live\nour lives by. To me, getting together for\na meal with good friends is without a\ndoubt all of this and more; it is an experience that whilst it may not be noted\nas such at the time, actually has a lot of\npower in your life.\nAnytime you sit with interesting\npeople you foster this preservation I\ntalk about, a preservation of curiosity,\nintellectual pursuit and betterment of\noneself through the sharing of ideas,\nand most importantly a preservation\nof friendships.\nI don\u2019t know what happened to dinner parties or enjoying food together\nin our generation, but one thing is cer-tain, the act of doing so with friends\nshould henceforth become a symbolic\ninvocation, a cry and a loudly voiced\nstatement that reconnects us with the\nurgency of maintaining the good things\nin our lives. It is good for us. It invites\nus to discover not only those around us\nbut ourselves.\nVirginia Woolf puts it much better\nthan myself: \u201cThe human frame being what it is, heart, body and brain all\nmixed together, and not contained in\nseparate compartments as they will no\ndoubt in another million years, a good\ndinner is of great importance to good\ntalk. One cannot think well, love well,\nsleep well, if one has not dined well\u201d.\nLaunceston Place\nGloucester Road\nRidiculously close to Imperial should you\nnot want to make the parents trek anywhere\noutside the comfortable South Kensington\nbubble. It has recently re-opened with new\nmanagement and most importantly, a great\nnew chef. The food can be termed \u2018modern\nEuropean with a twist\u2019. I absolutely recommend\nthe tasting menu. The staff is incredibly nice in\na restaurant that looks somewhat pretentious.\nAlthough quite expensive it is definitely worth\na visit. Dress up.\nThe Good: Proximity to College; staff.\nThe Bad: Price!\nGaucho\nGrill\nHampstead\nAlready a bit of a London\ninstitution if you have a\npenchant for steaks and meat.\nEverything on the menu hails\nfrom Argentina, from the meat to the\nwines. While there are a few branches\ncloser to College, the Hampstead one\nseems to be the best one, if not only for\nthe atmosphere of this beautiful and cosy\nbit of North London. Fillet, rump, sirloin,\nrib-eye, blade or brisket; any cut of meat\nthere is delicious and will be presented for\nyour approval before cooking. Don\u2019t order\nanything cooked above medium-rare.\nThe Good: Variety of beef cuts; quality of\nmeat\nThe Bad: Hardcore meat\neaters tend to be\nrather loud.\nHakasan\nTottenham Court Road\nIt has been described by some as \u201cchinese\nfood for white people\u201d. If you don\u2019t mind the\nguilt trip, this place is fabulous and offers\ndecent very value for money amongst London\u2019s\nso called \u2018elite restaurants\u2019. It\u2019s true that\ncod in champagne sauce does not sound\nincredibly oriental, but it is scrumptuous. I also\nrecommend the soft-shell crab and the dim\nsum sampler to start with. The service is top-notch and the waiters extraordinarily familiar\nwith what is a rather large menu.\nThe Good: Hands down, the starters \u2013 fill up\non them\nThe Bad: Feels slightly claustrophobic\nAsia de Cuba\nCharing Cross\nHoused in ultra-hip St Martin\u2019s Lane hotel, and\ntouting itself as \u2018asian fusion\u2019, Asia de Cuba is not only\na treat to the palate, but also a feast for the eyes in many\nways. The decor looks awesome and apart from the surroundings, the\npeople there tend to be stunning.\nThe food deserves major kudos for originality and preparation. I\nsuggest you let the waiter help you decide what to order as it is a\nsharing menu. Mad props go to the cocktail list which is out of this\nworld.\nThe Good: Originality of food; cocktails\nThe Bad: Long wait for a table on arrival, despite reservation\nLes Trois\nGar\u00e7ons\nShoreditch\nIn a totally inconspicuous building in the far land\nof East London lies this gem of French haute cuisine.\nThe place is filled with a paradoxically harmonious blend\nof highly ornate antiques pieces and trinkets that could\nhave been bought at a boot sale.\nThe food is prepared flawlessly and last time I checked\nthey had a menu for lactose intolerant folk. The wines\nare handpicked by the brothers who own and acutely\nmirror the personality of the restaurant \u2013 chaotic, but\nbeautiful. Check out the Lounge Lovers bar next door\nafter dinner.\nThe Good: Beautiful interiors; free entry to\nLounge Lovers\nThe Bad: Somewhat service\nfood.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFood\nFood Editors \u2013 Afonso Campos & Rosie Grayburn\n26 felix Friday 21 November 2008\n\n"

Pansy Wong who was born in China\nwas appointed Minister for ethnic affairs and women\u2019s\naffairs\nNew Zealand\nSouth Korea\u2019s Ministry of Education, Science\nand Technology has recently demanded that\nhistory books be re-written to remove what it\ncalls left-leaning contents. Though the ministry wants to encourage diversity in historical views, conservative critics are dismayed at\nhow chapters of the textbooks \u201cundermine the\nlegitimacy of the South Korean government,\u201d\nthrough their explanation of the Japanese colonialism era and the Cold War conflict. The\ncontroversy has sharpened the larger debate in\nSouth Korea over how to appraise past leaders.\nJapan saw similar controversies over how their\nteenagers are taught history in 2005. South\nKorean schools will be able to use the revised\ntextbooks from March 2009.\nSouth Korea\nThe Somali pirates who hijacked the Saudi\noil super-tanker Sirius Star have demanded\na ransom through the Al-Jazeera satellite\ntelevision station. The full laden supertanker is carrying two million barrels of oil\n- \u00bc of Saudi Arabia\u2019s daily oil output - and\nis among several Greek, Iranian and Hong\nKong cargo ships hijacked in the Gulf of\nAden off the coast of Somalia. Piracy from\ncriminals in the east-African state has grown\nin recent years with the Sirius Star being the\nbiggest vessel to be seized yet. The Indian\nNavy recently attacked and destroyed a pirate ship in the Gulf of Aden, and the UN\nand other national Navies are taking steps to\nfurther protect the vital shipping route.\nSomalia\nChief executives of the \u201cBig Three\u201d car manu-factures, Ford, General Motors and Chrysler\nhave asked the US Congress for an urgent $25bn\nbail-out. At a Senate hearing, the chief executives claimed that without financial help, the\nUS car industry will face catastrophe, causing\nripples through the rest of the economy as millions of people employed in car dealerships and\nauto garages across the USA will lose their jobs.\nGeneral Motors has suffered the most, with sales\ndown 45% from last month and losses of $4.2bn\nin the third quarter. Republicans and Democrats are split over whether part of the government\u2019s $700bn bail-out fund should be used to\nhelp the vulnerable carmakers, or whether they\nshould file for bankruptcy. European states are\nalso grappling with similar pleas from their auto\nsector, and Canada has already agreed to support\ncarmakers there.\nUSA\nA constitutional amendment which would extend the\nlength of the presidential term from four years to six in\nRussia is a step closer to passing as it was approved by\nthe lower house of the Russian parliament. The amendment was proposed by President Dmitry Medvedev\nhimself in early November, arguing the reforms will improve the political system, but Kremlin critics believe\nthe initiative is tailor-made for Prime Minister Vladimir\nPutin to return to his former post as President again.\nThe next step is the parliament\u2019s upper house, where if\na two-thirds majority is achieved, the amendment will\ntake effect and become the first ever change to Russia\u2019s\npost-Soviet constitution since its adoption in 1993.\nRussia\nFollowing months of negotiations, the Iraqi\ngovernment - lead by Prime Minister Nouri\nal-Maliki - has approved a security pact with\nUS military forces. The pact was approved by\nthe cabinet, but crucially it must be passed by\nthe parliament before it can take effect. The\npact outlines the terms by which US troops\nstationed in military bases across Iraqi would\nbe governed, something which was previously covered by the UN Mandate which is\ndue to expire on 31st December 2008. Most\nsignificantly the pact requires US troops to\nwithdraw from all Iraqi cities and towns by\nJune 2009 and from the country completely\nby the end of 2011. Parliamentary readings\nand debate have already begun, and the voting day for the pact is expected to be Monday\n24th November.\nIraq\nSelf-rule is back on track in Northern Ireland after a deal was reached concerning policing and\njustice of the country. In May 2008 a devolved\ngovernment was formed by a historic agreement\nbetween the Protestant Democratic Unionist\nParty (DUP) and Catholic Sinn F\u00e9in. But for the\nnext five months the power-sharing government\nwas dysfunctional because of deadlock over the\nseveral issues, principally the transfer of law enforcement from ministers in Westminster to Belfast. A breakthrough was finally achieved when\nit was agreed that a politician from a third party\nwould be selected to run the new Justice Department.

My eyes!\u201d Those\nwere the ecstatic\nscreams of a grown\nman, gazing with awe\nat the spectacular Ally\nPally firework display on Saturday\nnight.\nNorth London came out in force,\nfrom families to chavvy youths,\nperched on the slopes of Alexandra\nPark. Reputably the most spectacular\nfirework display in London, the benefits were obvious; unimpeded views\nfor all.\nThe display more than lived up to\nexpectation, essentially \u2018it was better\nthan last year\u2019. Set to a medley of classical music from film soundtracks, the\nfireworks kept to the style, with rhythmical bursts and interesting compositions lighting up the sky. At an intense\npace, the fireworks detonated thick\nand fast.\nThe glittery clouds and sparkly fountains (apologies for the flaky, nontechnical description) were my personal\nfavourites. My heart goes out to the\npoor animals traumatised by the deaf-eningly loud rockets. They were very,\nvery loud.\nSo far a perfect night, thoroughly\ndeserving of five stars. Such a shame\nwhen things took a turn for the worse\npost-fireworks. Like an episode of \u2018The\nSimpsons\u2019, the people of North London\nstampeded up the hill in search of al-cohol. The mob took down all security\nfences in their path, racing to reach the\nBier Festival.\nSuddenly the evening became extremely tedious, I lost all patience\nwith being herded around by security.\nThe whole experience became uncannily like a music festival. The crowd\ngrew restless. The muddy slippery\nhillside ruined my footwear. The toilet\nqueues grew exponentially longer. The\nbar, if you could get near, ran out of\nbeer. Generally it showed all the hallmark symptoms of large-scale event\ndisorganisation.\nIt\u2019s a shame these factors inevitably\nspoilt the experience. The organisers\nclearly put a lot of thought into making\na pleasant, family-friendly night, with\na choice of ice-skating, fun-fairs, live\nmusic and the Bier Festival within the\nmassive Victorian venue.\nThe kids clearly had the most fun\non the night, running rampage on\nthe trampolines, bungy-swings and\nrock-climbing wall. \u2018Queen on Fire\u2019, a\nfairly convincing Queen tribute band\nperformed indoors in the main hall.\nHowever they disappointed many\nby cutting to playback on \u2018Bohemian\nRhapsody\u2019. The Bier Festival had a very\npoor selection of two German beers,\nwhich promptly ran dry at that. Security cracked down on revellers dancing\non top of the long tables. It was \u2018alright\u2019\nbut many chose to drink elsewhere.\nFirework Display HHHII\nAlexandra Palace\nBest: Fireworks\nWorst: Frustatingly large\ncrowds.\nPrice: Voluntary contribution\n\u00a34/\u00a36\nFire at the disco!

Sacrilege!\nAfter experiencing Valgeir Sigur\u00f0sson and Sam Amidon in St Barnabas\u2019\nChapel earlier this year, I\u2019d like to add\n\u201clovely, creaky folk music and Icelandic\nelectronic neo-classical in chapels\u201d to\nthat list. It\u2019s a match made in heaven,\none where the delicate musical arrangements and quietly emotive vocal\ndeliveries perfectly complement the\nintimate setting, hushed reverence and\ndense atmospheres of these places of\nworship. This is why I jumped at the\nchance of seeing \u00d3lafur Arnalds at the\nUnion Chapel.\nHailing from the small Icelandic\ntown of Mosfellsb\u00e6r, the 21 year old\nhas spent 2008 supporting Sigur R\u00f3s\non their latest tour while promoting\nhis acclaimed debut album. \u2018Eulogy For\nEvolution\u2019 is a promising start for this\ntalented musician with its assured and\nbeautiful string-and-piano compositions punctuated by sudden outbursts\nof post-rock chaos.\nOpening for Arnalds on the night\nwas German folk singer, Finn. Walking on stage with white tape under his\neyes, what looked like a baggy white\nshirt with a giant collar worn back-wards, and black socks pulled up to his\nknees and over his mud-brown trou-sers, I was left with the impression that\nthis is probably what an Amish spaceman would look like. His plaintive gui-tar-and-violin melodies earthed his set\nhowever, and his mournful vocals laid\nthe mood for the rest of the evening\ndespite a rather distant performance,\noverall.\nFinn did make something obvious:\nhis playing about with effects pedals\nto create \u2018extra\u2019 guitarists and echo-y\nbacking vocalists was an indicator that\nArnalds\u2019 set would\nunfortunately\nsummon simi-lar, ghostly\nmusicians playing out of a Mac. Given the\nbudgets of these relatively unknown\nacts it\u2019s probably unfair to complain,\nbut it\u2019s still ever so slightly disappointing to discover that the live show you\u2019re\nabout to experience isn\u2019t completely,\nwell, live.\nSo I didn\u2019t particularly mind (or hon-estly, notice), when a few songs into his\nset, Arnalds forgets to press a button\nthat would have conjured his frantic\npost-rock guitar and drum noise on\n\u20183704 3837\u2019. His live piano and string\nquartet proved sufficient enough to fill\nthat gap and despite some sound issues\nthat prevented one of the instruments\nfrom delivering that extra \u2018oomph\u2019, the\nsound was general absorbing and hyp-notic. The quartet was particularly\nentrancing, their Philip Glass-inspired\nstrokes washing over the pews, reverberating around the cold building and\nenveloping the audience with a bittersweet haziness. Sitting in front of a\ngrand piano, Arnalds\u2019 melodies were\njust as affecting.\nThroughout, Arnalds was perfectly\ninviting as he honestly and humorously mentioned any gaffs and as well\nas the terrors of having to come back\nfor an encore: \u201cYou go back stage and\ntalk about the horrors of the show, but\nthen you realise that people are still\nclapping!\u201d It was then that he offered\nto replay \u20183704 3837\u2019, this time with the\nbutton pressed.\nA few weeks ago, I was having a\nconversation with a friend who had\n\u201cThis is probably\nwhat Amish\nspacemen look\nlike.\u201d\nOlafur Arnalds\nlive at the\nUnion Chapel\nbecome bored with live music. Having recently attended various gigs full\nof obnoxious, Red Stripe drinking piss\nheads who insist on speaking throughout an entire performance, I could understand where he was coming from.\nBut when the crowd is perfect and the\nsetting is right, there isn\u2019t a better ex-perience. For this gig, that experience\ncame with the main set\u2019s closing song,\n\u2018Himininn er ad Hrynju\u2019. What sounded like the bleeps of a heart monitor\nwas soon joined by a spooky and heavily distorted robotic voice as eerie projections of spirit-white bird silhouettes\nfloated up from the chapel\u2019s altar and\nacross the stain-glass windows.\nIt was an incredibly chilling, goose-bump-inducing effect and while Arnalds did little to\nstray from the\nsound of the\nrecord, it\u2019s\nsurprises\nlike this\nwhich\nmake live\nmusic\nworth-while.\nAnd the\nvenue\ncouldn\u2019t\nbe\nmore\nap-pro-priate.\n\n"

Write to us.\nclubsandsocs.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nClubs & Socs Editor - Alice Rowlands\nO\nkay, so there\u2019s a Lord, a\npresident and a physicist in a car (plus an\nengineer or two) \u2013 this\nis a story of nail biting\nspeed, mountainous hill climbs, perilous oil slicks, CGCU top hats and\nstripy jackets \u2013 it can only the London\nto Brighton Veteran Vehicle Run starring Bo\u2019. A little background before we\ngo any further. Boanerges (affection-ately known as Bo\u2019) \u2013 meaning sons of\nthunder \u2013 was manufactured in 1902\nby James and Browne of Hammersmith and has been the CGCU mascot\nsince 1934. He has spent the last 64\nyears throwing up no end of unusual\nand worrying bangs, clunks and more\nfumes (unadulterated by a catalytic\nconverter) than you could breathe in a\nlifetime.\nHaving recently had the engine cylinders extensively repaired some teething problems meant that an engine\nre-build was required the afternoon\nbefore the perilous drive to Brighton\ncould even be started. On the Sunday\nmorning at 6:30 AM Dave Hankin gently spun the starting handle and Bo\u2019,\nalong with his new phosphor bronze\nbearings, playfully roared into action\n\u2013 I say roar, maybe more a pup bang\npop bang! With our guests of honour\nProfessor Lord Robert Winston and\nCGCU President Mark Mearing-Smith\nsitting comfortably and wrapped up\nwarm, Henry Weaver, co-driver, and\nI [Rik Smith] began to drive the short\ndistance to the start at Hyde Park\nCorner.\nHaving noticed a bit of oil outside the\ngarage as we pulled out, we thought\nthis was nothing more than Bo\u2019 playfully marking his territory of South\nKensington and continued along our\nway. Pulling into Serpentine Road the\nplace was a throng with cars and en-thusiasts, all pre 1905 \u2013 and some of\nthe enthusiasts were even older.\nAt 7:26 AM Bo\u2019 and his band of\nmerry passengers crossed the start\nline and headed towards Hyde Park\nCorner roundabout. As we cruised\nthrough red lights and past waiting\ntraffic \u2013 Police controlled of course -we quickly slipped into 4th gear and\nmotored swiftly towards Buckingham\npalace, the game was afoot! At Streatham Hill the co-driver was changed to\nRobert Carter and we continued our\nway onto Croydon, where we doffed\nour hats to the Mayor and continued\nswiftly on. During the descent from\nthe hill and concrete jungle of Croydon, no sooner had we reach cruising\nspeed when |CLUNK| and one of our\nfront gas lamps had jumped ship from\nits metal bracket and plunged towards\nthe road. Slamming on the hand brake\nand foot operated transmission brake\nwe ground to a halt \u2013 some 50 yards\nlater \u2013 to find that the brass lamp had\nbroken its bracket and was supported\nnanometres above the tarmac by the\nacetylene hose, I detached the tube\nand thrust the lamp into the waiting\nhands of Lord Winston who interject-ed, \u201clooks like metal fatigue to me\u201d. Bo\u2019\ncontinued on from Croydon with one\neye removed.\nAs the miles clocked up we sadly\nhad to wave goodbye to Lord Winston\njust outside London but I am told that\nClem \u2013 one of our support vehicles in\nthe form of the RSM Motor Club\u2019s 1926\nMorris T-type one-ton truck - quickly\nwhisked him away to a slap up break-fast. As our halfway point approached\nI could feel something wasn\u2019t quite\nright, Bo\u2019 was telling me something. At\nthe next lights we pulled up onto the\npavement and gave him a quick once\nover, a squirt of oil in the bores and\na well deserved drink of water. Bob\nGoodwill, co-driver, pushed the pedestrian crossing button and waited for the\ngreen man, and at the next opportunity\nwe were back on the road. The town of\nCrawley offered us tea and a bacon roll\nwhich we grabbed and then made a\nsurge towards the hill stage. We passed\nthe half way point \u2013 by this time issuing less of an oil slick behind us. Our\nstop in Peas Pottage for a change of co-drivers and a more thorough once over\nrevealed that the oil slick we had been\nissuing for the past 30 miles was not\nBo\u2019 marking his territory (now extending into Sussex) but Bo\u2019 gently emptying the oil from his gear box through\na significant orifice onto the highway.\nAt once the support team jumped to\naction stations and within an hour and\na half a wooden patch had been manu-factured, gear box oil refilled and we\nwere back on the road.\nWith the improved compression provided by our rejuvenated cylinders it\nwas suggested that Bo\u2019 might just make\nit up the hill in second; however as the\nincline approached, we changed down\nthe gears, 3rd ... 2nd ... cries of \u201cCome\non Bo\u2019 you can do it\u201d were uttered by\nboth driver and co-driver, Daniel Izzat, under their breath, sadly the revs\nslowed further and we were forced into\nfirst. That\u2019s first gear up a hill which a\nlarge proportion of Veteran cars are\npersuaded up by an RAC van and a less\nthan subtle tow rope. As steam began\nto effervesce from beneath the floor\nboards we knew Bo\u2019 was ready to be at\nthe top; asking attendants how much\nfurther, they encouragingly said only\nanother 100 yards. As we rounded the\ncrest we slipped into 2nd, 3rd, 4th and\nwe knew that our side mounted radiators would be cooling Bo\u2019s heart with\nthe refreshing breeze.\nMark \u2013 now our only guest of honour and passenger was always keen to\nhelp, passing us the water, the starting handle, tool box or whatever other\nitems he was lumbered with in the\nback. However, one piece of information I didn\u2019t think he would come up\nwith as we were descending a gentle\nhill in 4th gear was our speed! Driving\nBo\u2019 is not an easy task but is none the\nless a delight; going down a hill is not\nfor the faint hearted. With the wind\nbattering my hands and face \u2013 wondering if the top hat will stay in place Mark\ncoolly interjects while reading from\nhis Blackberry, \u201c23... 24... 25, that\u2019s 25\nmile per hour!\u201d - 25 was more or less\nour top speed for the day. But that\u2019s\n25 mph provided by 1902 technology\nsupported on wooden wheels, 4 leaf\nsprings and enough split pins and steel\ngears to shake a stick at, 25 mph is fast\nenough for me.\nAs the final stage approached we\ncruised downhill into Brighton in 4th\ngear knowing we needed to keep the\npace up to cross the line by 4PM; happily we were parked up on Madeira\nDrive by 3:45. Having been quizzed by\na gentleman on the finish line with a\nmicrophone attached to the Tannoy\nhe asked, \u201chave you had any problems\ngetting here today?\u201d to which I could\nonly reply, \u201cno, not at all, just a minor\noil leak which delayed us by about an\nhour and a half!\u201d\nTales of worrying bangs and clunks\nRick Smith reports on the Bo\u2019s adventures on the Brighton Run, with photographs from Jonathan Silver\nKeeping the candle burning\nAmnesty International is a non-governmental organisation dedicated to ending human rights abuses across the world,\nand supporting those affected by human rights violations. Founded in the UK in 1961, it is a secular, politically neutral\nbody whose reputation has earned it a UN human rights prize and a Nobel peace prize. While Amnesty are best known\nfor taking action on behalf of individual prisoners of conscience, you may also have heard of such campaigns as \u201cProtect the Human\u201d and \u201cStop Violence Against Women\u201d. Amnesty is also heavily involved in the Control Arms campaign\nalongside other organisations.\nOn a lighter note, you will likely have heard of the Secret Policeman\u2019s Ball, a fundraising event famously held by and\nin support of Amnesty International. Started up in the 70s and directed by John Cleese, its 2006 and 2008 revivals were\nboth held next door in the Royal Albert Hall. The latter featured appearances by celebrities ranging from Alan Carr,\nGraham Norton, and Mitchell and Webb to Keane and Razorlight. It is still available to watch online if you missed it.\nAmnesty is constantly introducing new campaigns and targeting new aspects of its human rights cause. In the coming months you can expect to see celebrations of the 60th birthday of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,\nAmnesty\u2019s annual Greetings Cards campaign (which invites participants to send seasonal greetings at Christmas time\nto prisoners of conscience around the world), and events focused on the 7th birthday on Guantanamo Bay. In the new\nyear Amnesty International will be launching an exciting (and potentially controversial) new major campaign to target\nthe human rights violations caused by governments and multinational corporations that perpetuate world poverty.\nNow is a better time than ever to act in support of a charity that reinforces the fundamental human rights that are all\ntoo frequently violated across the world. You can get involved on own your own through the actions suggested on Amnesty\u2019s UK website (also a good place to find more information about what Amnesty International do \u2013 www.amnesty.\norg.uk) or through Imperial\u2019s Amnesty International Society.\nI\nmperial College\u2019s Amnesty International Society recently\njoined over fifty other Amnesty\nstudent groups from across the\ncountry at the annual student\nconference, held at Reading University.\nRunning across a whole weekend, the\nevent was packed with talks, work-shops, actions and a couple of well deserved social events.\nFollowing a night on the floor of a\nsports hall, Saturday morning kicked\noff with two plenary talks by some key\nfigures in Amnesty and the world of\nhuman rights in general. The discussion was led by Kate Allen, UK director\nof AI, who was joined by deputy secretary general Kate Gilmore and the BBC\njournalist Alan Johnston, who talked\nabout how his own human rights were\nfamously violated. Each told the audience of students about how they became interested in human rights, how\nthey got involved with Amnesty International and what human rights means\nto them now. The second plenary that\nmorning featured Gita Sahgal, head of\nthe AI gender unit, and Maajid Nawaz,\nfounder of an extreme Islamist organisation turned prisoner of conscience\nand human rights defender.\nThese talks were followed by opportunities for the attending students to\nlearn more about specific campaigns\nand how to take action to defend human rights in a series of workshops.\nI attended a workshop on Amnesty\u2019s\nnew campaign targeting world poverty,\nwhich quickly descended into a heated\ndebate about the political ramifications\nof the campaign and the controversy it\nmight generate. Such debates between\nthe like-minded and passionate students I found myself at the conference\nwith were the highlight of the weekend\nfor me. The second workshop I went\nto was about how to motivate and activate your own student group. Some of\nmy group members attended a workshop on taking action through disturbing public tranquility \u2013 so watch out\nfor us on campus!\nThe afternoon plenary focused on\nthe Control Arms campaign Amnesty\nis involved in alongside other charities.\nImperial has had an Amnesty student group for around six years now, but\nwe remain a relatively small group and all too often hear \"but I didn't know\nImperial had an Amnesty group!\" - we're hoping to change that. Amnesty is a\nwonderful opportunity to get involved in human rights, increase your awareness of current affairs and meet new, like-minded people.\nWe have various events coming up and in the pipeline. During the imminent S.H.A.G. week we will be showing a film and holding a discussion/\ndebate.\nThis December we'll be running our annual Greetings Cards campaign\nhelped out by Leonardo Soc, and we will be attending the London protests\non the anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Next year\nwe're planning events relating to Guanatanmo Bay (yes \u2013 there will be cages\nand orange boiler suits for all!) and the Control Arms campaign. Anybody\ncan attend these events, including non-members.\nWe always welcome new members and are always flexible about how involved you can or can't afford to get. Please come along to one of our weekly\nmeetings (held on a Tuesday lunchtime \u2013 there are always biscuits!) or one of\nour major events to find out more. We look forwarding to hearing from you\nvia amnesty@imperial.ac.uk.\nCampaigner David Grimason touched\nus all with his story of how his own\nson was killed a result of uncontrolled\narms trading. Oliver Sprague, the programme\u2019s director, told us about what\ncan be done about controlling the arms\ntrade and how to get involved. Famed\ncomedian and political activist Mark\nThomas talked about breaking into a\nweapons convention, his own dealings\nwith arms dealer traders and more recently taking on Coca Cola. It came as\nno surprise to us that Mark is in the\nGuiness Book of Records for \u201cmost\nnumber of political demonstrations in\n24 hours\u201d.\nThe weekend wasn\u2019t just about sitting\nthrough talks \u2013 in Amnesty International we like to have fun too! Saturday\nnight was a more social occasion. We\ngot to know members of other groups\nwhile eating free cake and being entertained by a stand-up performance by\nMark Thomas and awesome ska band\nBrothers Bab.\nSunday saw the 260 students at the\nconference taking action to fight for\nwomen\u2019s rights in Iran. In Iran, women\nmake up more than 60% of the student\npopulation but are second class citizens subject to many discriminatory\nlaws.\nAn Iranian woman is under control\nof her husband or father, receiving half\nthe inheritance of a brother and being\ntargeted by honour killings for disobe-dience. An Iranian woman\u2019s evidence\nin court is by law worth half of that of\na man. As part of Amnesty\u2019s ongoing\ncampaign against these inequalities,\nwe took part in a demonstration on the\nReading University campus. Expect\nto see our faces on a TV screen in the\nnear future...\nI think I can speak for all who attended from Imperial when I say this weekend was not only fun but changed our\nperspectives on human rights and the\nwork of Amnesty International. The\nconference has motivated us to take\nmore action to promote and defend\nhuman rights, and we have walked\naway with so many ideas about how to\nmake our student group bigger, better\nand louder.\nEmily Wilson joins the Amnesty International society at their annual students\u2019 conference in Reading\nAbout Amnesty International\nAmnesty at Imperial\nLook at them. They care. And think they can make a difference. Eurgh.

Unfortunately\nit didn\u2019t take much longer for the opposition to neutralise IC\u2019s most potent\ntactic, forcing a substitution of linesman Mo after giving offside every time\nthey got possession.At 2-0 IC sat back\nwith captain Ron Atkinson patrolling midfield like a commando and\nTom Adams protecting the back four.\nWinehands, Dave, Simon and Jose\nwere on call to clean up any unwanted\ndischarge from the midfield and the attacking foursome of Big Deen, Mamzi,\nMike and Tristan (just on time after\na gamblers annonymous meeting ran\nlate) repeatedly infiltrated the LSE\nbackline but were unable to inflict any\ncollateral damage.\nA few minutes into the second half\nand a Mo-rale boosting moment for\nIC as the disgraced linesman entered\nthe fray for the first time since a life\nthreatening ankle injury sustained during the 4-0 merkalisation of Holloway\nlast month.

The LSE \u2018keeper had clearly\nbeen paying attention when watching his VHS of \u201cGoalkeeping Skills by\nHeurelho Gomes and Ryan Apicella\u201d\nand proceeded to fanny the ball into\nhis own net.\nFrom then on IC continued to shag\nthe proverbial granddaughter and\nchances were laid on for Tristan and\nDan Abebe, only for the first to fire\nstraight at the \u2018keeper and the second\nto be twice denied by LSE\u2019s own corrupt linesman. The game careered to\na sudden and unexpected end on 90\nminutes and IC 5s powered their way\nto the top of the table.

The\noriginal complaint was lodged against\nImperial College Hockey Club but it\nwas later found that the club involved\nwere indeed the Football Club. The\nhockey club were proven to have been\nin Fulham at the time of the incidents.\nThe Hockey Club have since received\nan apology from the Football Club\nCaptain James Skeen.\nA number of complaints have been\nreceived from residents in Hammersmith about vandalism and drunken\nbehaviour caused by Imperial College\nstudents taking part in a pub crawl last\nWednesday. The main bulk of incidents\napparently occurred in the area close\nto Hammersmith Bridge, near the Blue\nAnchor and the Rutland Arms.\nImperial College Football Club were\ntaking part on their annual \u2018Hammy 10\u2019,\na 10 pub pub-crawl in Hammersmith\nthat the football club have been doing\nfor several years. The crawl starts in\nStamford Brook and finishes in the Old\nCity Gates pub next to Hammersmith\nBridge, with the Rutland Arms and the\nBlue Anchor being two of the stops\nalong the way. Nearly 90 members of\nthe club took part on the crawl, with\nthe group splitting into several smaller\ngroups in order to, according to the\nfootball club captain James Skeen,\n\u2018not cause a disturbance\u2019. Several past\nmembers of the club were also present\nin some of the pubs along the route,\nand moved on with the \u2018lead\u2019 group as\nand when they arrived.\nThe main allegations made against\nthe club were by local residents and\nlandlords, as the club reached the various pubs next to Hammersmith Bridge.\nAccording to residents, the club allegedly caused \u00a3600 worth of damage to\nthe Rutland Arms by throwing glasses\nand bottles about, as well as damaging various artefacts in the pub such\nas vases. After this, members of the\nclub proceeded to go outside and then\nthrow glass at houseboats moored on\nthe river, before moving on to the next\npub. Having seen the behaviour of the\nmembers involved, The Blue Anchor\ndecided not to admit any more members into the pub, which resulted in\nsome intimidation from the group. felix was also informed by the staff at the\npubs that the police were called down,\nand a couple of students were apparently stopped and asked questions before being released.\nFrom here, the group then moved\nonto the Old City Gates, the final stop\non the route, where landlord Dennis\nMcCarthy told felix that the group had\ntrashed the male toilets, removed the\nhandrail off the wall, trashed the cubicle as well as smashing a large amount\nof glasses and windows in the door.\nStaff at the Rutland Arms also\nclaimed that the problems they had\nat their pub was not an isolated inci-dent, with them claiming that the same\ngroup of people had caused damage\nand disorder in at least four other pubs\nup and down the river.\nImperial College Football Club Captain and another member of the committee have, since the event, been to all\nthe pubs on the route to firstly apologise and secondly find out what hap-pened. Club Captain, James Skeen, told\nfelix that \u201cthere were so many groups\nand only so many committee members\nthat could be with them to control everything.\u201d He then went on to say that:\n\u201cThe problems seemed to have been\ncaused by a small group towards the\nback of the pub crawl where their actions couldn\u2019t be noticed.\u201d\nWith so many groups passing\nthrough the pubs, it was apparently\ndifficult to identify the individual cul-prits; however felix understands that\nthose responsible have come forward\nto Imperial College Union.\nSince the full extent of the evening\nwas slowly being unravelled, it became\napparent to the club which one of the\ngroups on the pub crawl were the main\nIC Football Club cause\nproblems in Hammersmith\nA statement from\nthe Club Captain\nJames Skeen\nICUAFC Club Captain\nJovan Nedi\u0107\nEditor in Chief\nBack in November 2007, felix reported on the events surrounding\nan incident in Da Vinci\u2019s after an official complaint was made against\nthe football club over homophobic\nchants. The club denied that they\nwere directed at any individual but\nat the rugby club. The entire club\nwas banned for a week.\nWhat the\nresidents say\nPositives\nNegatives\nDamaged caused in the hotel with\nthe \u00a31,000 deposit not being re-turned. No apology was given to\nthe hotel and as a result all Imperial students were banned from\nhaving events at the hotel again.\nSeveral members of the club have\nbeen banned for various time\nscales for reasons. There have\nbeen several recorded incidents\nof players arguing and taunting\ndoor staff, to spitting and fighting\nwith other students in The Union.\nClashes with Royal Holloway supporters at the University of London\nChallenge Cup Final in Motspur\nPark football ground. Damaged\ncaused to the facilities reached\nthe sum of \u00a360 after the Imperial\nfootball club accused the Holloway supporters of taunting and\nlooking for a fight after Holloway\nwon the match.\nsource of trouble. Many have argued\nthat the lack of control of the members in the club is the fault of the club\nand by default the club Captain, whilst\nsome members of the Football Club\nclaimed that it is \u2018very difficult\u2019 to control a small minority of the members\ndespite \u2018a lot of effort being made\u2019.\nDespite their every attempt, it is clear\nthat there are members in the club that\nare the main source of the problem.\nCertain members of the club, who,\nwish to remain anonymous, have also\ntold felix that they found it \u2018unfair that\nthe whole club gets such a bad name\nbecause of the actions of a few idiots.\u2019\nWhatever the reasoning for the be-haviour, and the distinct lack of discipline in the club over the past few\nyears, many from Imperial College Union and Imperial College have called\nfor a radical change in the behaviour\nof the club. Sport Imperial have also\nthreatened of removing the club from\nBritish University and College Sports\n(BUCS) leagues which would effectively dissolve the club for the year.\nOne thing that can be said is that\nthere are clear signs and willingness\nfor change. In comparison to last year,\nthe club is actively trying to rectify\ntheir image and are trying to hold their\nmembers to account. felix managed to\nget in touch with most of the pubs on\nthe route, and found a mixed bag of responses from the landlords.\nLandlords from the earlier pubs\nalong the route told felix that they received no problems from the students\nand had no complaints. The landlord\nof the Rutland Arms, where most of\nthe trouble started, told felix that he\n\u201chad seen a lot worse before\u201d, whilst the\nDennis McCarthy, landlord of the Old\nCity Gates, said that the whole thing\nwas \u201cquite frightening for the staff , but\nno-one was hurt. However it was very\ngood of them to come and apologise.\u201d\nThere are signs of improvement in\nthe Football Club, but many from Imperial College Union and Imperial College wonder whether it is a new leaf or\njust empty promises.\nThis is not the first time that Imperial College Football Club have had\nproblems with the University and Imperial College Union. Below are\nsome of the incidents as well as the consequences.\nOn the pitch, the club as a whole has had varied success. They field a total of 9 teams, seven\nplay in the University of London Union (ULU) leagues, four of which are in the British Universities and College Sports leagues (BUCS), Aside from the sporting abilities of the club, they have\narranged community work in Eastern European countries.\nULU Challenge Cup\nImperial College Football Club 1st\nXI have reached the final of the\nCup for the past two years, winning it in 2007 and losing to Royal\nHolloway in last yeasr final at Motspur Park.\nThe 1st XI are expected to reach\nthe final of the cup again this year,\nhopefully with better results.\nPhotograph by Dave Murray\nThe Rutland Arms, the scene of the incidents last week\nWhilst having a drink by the riverside in Hammersmith on Friday evening,\na group of Imperial students were approached by a resident of the nearby\nhouseboats and were told they \u201cshould be aware that Imperial College students are not very welcome around here following an incident on Wednesday night,\u201d and that if they were planning on staying for a while they might\nbe \u201cadvised to remove your \u2018Imperial College\u2019 banners in order to avoid unwanted attention.\u201d\nExpanding on his initial comments, he told the students, \u201cWe had your\nhockey club down here, about 100 of them came through, they trashed a few\nof the pubs along the river and threw glasses at the boats. It was particularly\nupsetting because I have kids and they were quite scared.\u201d He added that the\ngroup \u201chad claimed to be from a different college before admitting to being\nImperial students.\u201d\nThe landlord of the Rutland Arms spoke to felix, confirming reports from local residents that a large group of Imperial College students had been in the\narea on Wednesday night and had caused a considerable amount of damage\nto the outside of the property. The landlord has been in contact with college,\nin order to lodge a complaint and to recoup around \u00a3600 worth of damage\nto his property.\nAs things got out of hand, The Rutland Arms began to refuse service to the\ngroup, at this point they began to throw glasses into the river, in the direction\nof the houseboats.\nDennis McCarthy from the Old City Gate told felix a \u201cconsiderable amount\nof damage\u201d was caused to the property including a toilet cubicle and a window in the front door. Glasses were \u201cindiscriminately\u201d thrown into the street,\ndisturbing passers by.\nHe described the incident as quite \u201cdisturbing for the staff\u201d, and other cus-tomers. He added, \u201cIt was very good of them to apologise , but what probably\nshould have been high spirited fun, went completely over the top. The main\nthing is that no-one was hurt. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s not indicative of the whole of Imperial, it just takes a few people to ruin things.\u201d\nA social event last week involving Imperial College Football Club is\ncurrently under investigation both by Imperial College Union and the club\nitself. Unfortunately the event which was attended by a large number of\npast and present members was spoiled by the actions of a small minority\nwhich has now brought both the club and Imperial College into disrepute.\nThe club and the Union are working together to ensure the guilty\nindividuals are identified and suitably dealt with.\nFollowing being given details of the alleged incidents, myself and another\nclub official immediately personally visited the effected parties to offer our\nsincerest apologies on behalf of the club.\nFurther to this I would like to extend my apologies to the wider Imperial College\ncommunity. I am deeply embarrassed by the behaviour of these\nmembers as well as the damage it will do to the reputation of the club and\ncollege. I appreciate that apologising doesn\u2019t change what has happened\nbut the new club executive committee has recently been working hard to\nremove a previously negative culture which had been installed in the club.\nFollowing the lessons learnt from this incident I am confident the club will\nmove forward and proudly represent Imperial College as a majority of our\nmembers currently do.\nCommunity Work\nBUCS \u2018Focus\u2019\nUniversity\nInternational\nstandard players\nVarsity Champions\nWhilst on tour in Germany and\nCzech Republic this summer, the\nclub arranged to do some community work.\nThe club are looking to arrange\nmore community work on their tour\nnext summer.\nBUCS have chosen Imperial College\nas the only London based university\nto develop football in 6 key areas.\nThe main objective of this is to engage universities such as Imperial\nin the new FA national football strat-egy, which aims to improve football\nat a grass route level.\nImperial College Football Club\nhave several semi-professional\nand professional football players,\nwith one reaching full international\nlevel.\nAlong with the help of Queens\nPark Rangers, the club has the\nfacilities and expertise to improve\non the pitch.\nEver since football was included in\nthe Varsity set-up, the Imperial football club have never lost a game,\nsomething which they are very\nproud of.\nThe club is looking to continue\nthis winning streak this year when\nthey will face Imperial Medicals yet\nagain.\n\n"

    "content": "science.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nScience\n14 felix Friday 21 November 2008\nThose who scan the Technology pages\nof the BBC for fun probably saw the\ndelightfully ingenious study into the\nmechanics of spam. Yes, that\u2019s spam of\nthe aetherial electronic variety, rather\nthan the indiscriminate meat sort.\nIf you\u2019ve ever wondered how the\nhairy-palmed vandals laying siege to\nyour inbox make money out of their\nendless barrage of exhortations for this\npill, that degree, or those ladies, look no\nfurther than the aforementioned spam\nreport. You can find it at www.icsi.ber-keley.edu/pubs/networking/2008-ccs-spamalytics.pdf. I won\u2019t spend much\ntime reviewing the study here, pointing you instead to the BBC coverage\nor, better, the original article: I\u2019d highly\nrecommend having a read of it \u2013 it\u2019s\nwell-written, accessible, and entertain-ing, representing a study much in the\nvein of Freakonomics.\nBriefly, the authors managed to insinuate themselves into the Storm bot-net, a sophisticated network of infected\ncomputers, operated remotely by a few\nmaster computers. Following ethical\nprinciples to the letter, they hijacked\na portion of the botnet, covering their\ntracks to avoid discovery by the botnet administrators, and replaced the\noriginal outgoing spam messages with\nones of their own, directing the hapless\nrecipients to a site the authors had set\nup. A number of campaigns were run,\nincluding one where the end site nominally sold pharmaceutical products of\nthe blue variety. By monitoring how\nmany visits they got to the site from\nthe original spam recipients and seeing\nhow many visitors attempted to purchase pills, the researchers were able\nto quantify the profitability of spam\ncampaigns, and to infer the likely size\nof these operations. Turns out that\nthe profit margins are probably rather\nmeagre, so don\u2019t start making lists of\nall your Facebook not-really-friends\nquite yet \u2013 though it might be satisfying to get payback for all those sodding\nvampire invitations, making money\nfrom this ploy has all the prospects of a\nstone-transfusion blood-bank.\nHowever, there are plenty more interesting little nuggets in this study\nthan the authors had the space, or possibly gall, to analyse. However, I know\nno such bounds, and so am leaping at\nthe chance to read far more into the\ndata than I suspect the authors would\nbe comfortable in, and to grace the august pages of Felix with some original\nresearch on plagiarised results. There\u2019ll\neven be a table.\nMy first attempt centred on the fact\nthat the results were global, offering\nsome apparently entertaining comparisons of different countries\u2019 susceptibility to spam. However, I was unable\nto obtain a world gullibility index: the\nspoil-sport authors caution against using response rates as a method for inferring \u201cdegrees of cultural or national\ninterest in the particular promises or\nproducts conveyed by the spam\u201d, instead suggesting it is due to regional\ndifferences in the quality of spam fil-tering, and anti-spam education. A\nshame, as it would have been funny to\nissue scurrilous remarks about Bulgaria, Pakistan and India, and to note the\nheightened interest in France for pharmacy related spam (and conversely the\ncurious lack of it in the States) \u2013 does\nthe libidinous reputation require propping up?\nHowever, even if hopes to analyse\nregional differences are dashed, there\u2019s\nhope yet on the global scale \u2013 I put it\nto you this study offers an unrivalled\nopportunity to study world idiocy. I\u2019ll\nbe propping up this contentious claim\nwith some very shaky assumptions,\nand dubious maths, and will unapolo-getically try to point this out where I\ndo, hoping a brazen approach will get\nyou unwittingly to the end this \u201cstudy\u201d\nbefore it all becomes too much, and\nyou throw this paper away in disgust.\nCommencing with what we know\nfrom the original study \u2013 the authors\nsend out many spam emails, of which\na number A (82,700,000) got to a valid\naddress. These are then sent either to\nspam folders or inboxes, in unknown\nnumbers, which we denote by B and C\nrespectively (Ooh, doesn\u2019t that sound\nscientific!). Due to all that, the researchers\u2019 website received a number\nof visits E (10522, which doesn\u2019t include crawlers), of which a number G\n(28) were \u201cconverted\u201d \u2013 an attempt was\nmade to pay for pills.\nI\u2019ve taken the liberty of putting this\ninformation in a chart, Figure 1 (award-ing self star for geekiness), and take this\npoint to explain the assumptions I\u2019m\nmaking elsewhere in this chart. I\u2019m going to try to determine the fraction of\nthe population those 28 represent. And\nI\u2019m going to callously equate those 28,\nas insensitively as only the youthfully\nvirile can, with imbeciles. Uncharitable - perhaps they can\u2019t use the normal\nways to surmount the problems the\npills address \u2013 but I\u2019m flint-hearted: it\u2019s\npoltroons like them who make spam\nprofitable, and open my college inbox\nto almost 400 daily missives of bilge.\nHaving justified the numerator, let\u2019s\nlook at the denominator. I\u2019ll restore\nkarmic balance by munificently bestowing a status of \u201cweirdly curious,\nbut not idiotic\u201d on those who clicked\non the spam\u2019s link, but didn\u2019t attempt\nto order pills (F). Yes, this is generous,\nand does not allow us to quantify for\nthe virile morons, who probably belong in the numerator. Tough \u2013 they\nprobably contribute to the gene pool,\nand it gives me one of the terms in\nmy denominator. To this number, we\nalso need to add the idiots (for correct\nnormalisation, muggins), and D, the\nnumber of those who saw the spam in\ntheir inboxes, but who ignored it. To\nexpress this mathematically, the Idiot\nIndex I.I. = G/(F+G+D). You\u2019ve reached\nEquation 1: 1up, or eat a mushroom.\nUnfortunately, to know D, we need\nto know C, the number of messages\nfrom the original 82-odd million which\nmade it to the spamees\u2019 inboxes (what\na silly plural). Which we don\u2019t. Note\nI\u2019m making another assumption here,\nnamely that no-one is dumb enough\nto have gone to a folder labelled spam\nand clicked on messages inside. Rash,\nas that sort certainly belong in our\nnumerator, but this is utterly unquan-tifiable, whereas torturing the original\nresearch Madsen-like will yield C.\nTable 1 (I\u2019m going all out here) sum-marises the top 10 ranking email domain names spam was sent to, together\nwith the fraction of spam sent to that\ndomain. I\u2019ve also included a column on\nwhether the domain is free, for reasons\nwhich will soon become apparent. To\nmonitor what happened to the spam\nafter it was sent by the botnet, the researchers cunningly set up some fake\nemail addresses at the top 3 webmail\nproviders (no surprises: Hotmail, Yahoo and Gmail), and others at their de-partment, filtered through a commercial spam-filter, Barracuda, apparently\nwith slightly more permissive spam-tagging than default settings. The third\ncolumn indicates, where applicable,\nthe percentages of messages sent to\nthose accounts which ended up in the\ninbox: inbox infiltration. Note that the\ncommercial spam-filter (right at the\nbottom of the table) performs much\nworse than the webmail accounts.\nAnyway, I\u2019m going to take a simple\nbinary approach, based on the difference between the webmail and commercial spam filter, and assume that\nthis difference is due to resources alone\n\u2013 the more email addresses a provider\nrepresents, the more resources it is\nable to dedicate to sifting out spam. So\nfree webmail providers, who represent\nmany users, are very good at keeping\nusers\u2019 inboxes clean. If that sounds too\nsimplistic, this next bit is really going\nto grate: We\u2019re going to estimate the\nnumber of emails reaching inboxes, C,\nby adding the product of number of in-boxes with inbox infiltration for both\nthe free and the commercial providers.\nVery messy in practice, this. Of the top\n10 providers, those which are definitely\nfree represent 22.6% of email addresses\ntargeted. This might well be a rather\nfat-tailed distribution, so saying that\nincluding all providers, not just the top\n10, will take this number only up to\n25% is very foolish. But invoking the resource argument above again, if we go\ndown the rankings, these free domains\nwill have fewer users, and thus fewer\nresources to devote to spam filtering,\nso their infiltration values will be more\nakin to the commercial, thus belonging\nin that term: our division into free and\ncommercial is really based on filtering\nefficiencies, after all.\nDoing the maths, if 25% of A went to\nfreedomains,whichhaveanaveragein-What spam really means\nPeople who buy spam pills are morons, but how much of society do they represent? felix does the maths\nKurt Osyzs filtration (worked out from the average\nof the top 3) of 0.00285%, 589 emails\nwill have got through to the free inbox-es. Now for those with commercial-like infiltration values. They represent\n75% of A \u2013 but what should we use as\ntheir infiltration? We only have 1 data\npoint, which represents a filter with\npermissive settings! Ha, we scoff at this\nand whack a factor of 0.5 in front of the\ncommercial infiltration of 0.131%, to\nsimulate improved filtering due to less\npermissive settings, and find 40626\nemails reach commercial inboxes; by\nfar the dominating contribution, and\ngrossly sensitive to our fudge-factor.\nBut a reality check reveals that the total\nnumber of emails reaching inboxes, C,\nis 41215 \u2013 a number larger than E, so\nwe\u2019ve not managed to trash the model\nin Figure 1. Subtracting E from C to\nget D, and plugging it into Equation 1,\nwith the previously known quantities,\nwe find the Idiot Index is 0.068%.\nWe could leave this there, but that\u2019s\nnot headline material, and I\u2019m on a\nroll, or at least a bun. The present\nworld population W, which we round\nto 6,710, 000,000 and the globally average birth rate X (20.18 babies / 1000 of\npopulation / year), which we can multiply to find the number of people born\nevery year. Ooh, let\u2019s include a factor Y,\nto work out how many of those make it\nout of infancy: we only care about people old enough to use a computer and a\ncredit card. We get this factor from the\ninfant mortality rate Z = 42.09 deaths\n/ 1000 live births. So the infancy survival factor Y will be (1000-42)/1000,\nor 0.958.\nMultiplying W with X and Y, we find\nthe present rate of birth of people who\nmake it through infancy is 129 million\nper year, or 245 per minute. Let\u2019s call\nthis number M. (Nice and in the middle \u2013 we\u2019ve covered both ends of the\nalphabet now, and screw Greek or Hebrew letters)\nLet\u2019s just step back, and mention\na couple of other assumptions we\u2019re\njust about to make. The first is that M\ncomes from global averages, and will\nencompass mostly people without access to credit cards and the internet.\nSo combining that with the results of\nour earlier investigation may seem\ngrossly unfair. But let\u2019s note the original research showed fairly good global\ncoverage, with less of a North-South /\nrich-poor country skew than might be\nexpected.\nSo let\u2019s gloss over this access issue\nin a Panglossian fashion, assuming the\nbest of all possible worlds, where intelligence (and hence the lack thereof) is\nall nature, no nurture, where the gene-pool is uniformly distributed across all\nnations and all socioeconomic backgrounds so that a sample of intelligence\nin one segment of society extends to all\nothers.\nWe\u2019re also assuming no correlation\nbetween intelligence and language\nspoken. An interesting, if controversial\ntopic, left aside, but if present, this may\nhave implications for our findings \u2013 I\ndon\u2019t see any indication the authors\nwrote the spam in any languages other\nthan English. But here we cite the presence of many countries where English\nis not the native tongue \u2013 eg France.\nPhew, enough prevarication, let\u2019s cut\nto the chase, and multiply our birth\nrate M with our idiot index I.I., as\nyou\u2019ve all been waiting for.

I also noted that\nthe vast majority of the figures possess\na penis and a set of testicles dangling\nfrom stringy anatomy you can hardly\nbelieve supports them. Yes, there were\na few female bodies, whose skinned\nbreasts almost made them more unsettling to see but the men dominated. I\nwould be interested to know if this is\ndue to an imbalance in the people who\ndonate themselves to Dr. von Hagens.\nThe general idea of the exhibition\nis to demonstrate the passage of time\nand the process of aging. It kicks off at\nconception. Here you can see a whole\nrange of foetuses starting at a fleck of\na cell ball you can barely make out,\nall the way up to birth. A highlight is\nthe dead body of a pregnant woman,\nlying down casually and sectioned so\nyou can see how the baby sits inside\nher. The foetuses affected me more\nthan I would have expected. I\u2019m a firm\nbeliever in pro-choice and I believe\nstrongly in a woman\u2019s right to abort\nan unwanted child. But coming face to\nface with these foetuses did make me\nsee the pro-life argument \u2013 at 24 weeks\n(the legal cut-off for abortion here in\nthe UK), and even before, a foetus\nlooks like an actual person, complete\nwith fingers and toes. For me this beginning was the most unsettling part of\nthe whole exhibition.\nThe rest of the exhibition carries on\nthrough life, from childhood through\nadolescence and into old age. There\nis a great deal of focus on the damage\naging does to the human body. There\nare joints from arthritis sufferers and\ntumour-ridden internal organs demonstrating perfectly how we gradually\nfall apart after we hit 30. Even in our\nearly 20s our brains are beginning their\ngradual decline. A highlight for me was\na feature on how eyesight fails and how\nsome of our famous artists probably\ndeveloped their characteristic styles\nthrough their inability to see clearly;\nMonet\u2019s blurry oil paintings being a\ncase in point. A plastinated body holds\na paintbrush and easel and stands at\na canvas to accompany this section.\nThere is a cheap print of Monet\u2019s \u2018Water Lilies\u2019 strapped to an artist\u2019s easel,\nwhich I was amused to see attracting\nthe attention of two women. \u201cIs that\nL\nast time I promised you a\nbook review. The sad thing\nis that between my last stab\nat editing and now, I have\nnot finished a book. I\u2019m still\nreading the 900-page door-stopping\nepic that is The Mitfords, which is a\ncollection of letters between the Mitford sisters of upper-class, eccentric,\nNazi-loving fame. It\u2019s a brilliant book\nwhich has been making me laugh, cry\nand think all at once but I\u2019ve been reading it for months and I\u2019m only 500 or\nso pages in. I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ll ever finish\nit, particularly given that I keep picking up more accessible material to read\nalongside it. Currently, I\u2019m on a rather\ngood sociobiological/anthropologi-cal number about human evolution.\nThe chapter on the evolution of human sexual behaviour is particularly\ndelectable.\nThe question that I just know is on\nyour lips, as always, is: what have I\nbeen up to if not reviewing books?\nWell, this past weekend I went and saw\nthe Rothko exhibition at Tate Modern\nfor a second time. I hope you all paid\nattention to my previous review of the\nexhibition and have already gone to see\nit. No? You ignored me? Harsh. It\u2019s a\ngreat exhibition! Go see it!\nNow normally I would only go to an\nexhibition once, but this one was even\nbetter the second time round. I picked\nup on so many different things I hadn\u2019t\nnoticed the first time and so many of\nmy opinions changed. It was a com-Emily Wilson\nArts Editor\npletely different experience. Before,\nmy favourites were the black-on-black\nbunch at the back of the exhibition.\nThis time I was less keen in comparison to my renewed passion for the\n\u2018Seagram Murals\u2019. They were beautiful\nand I have no idea why I didn\u2019t adore\nthem as much the first time. So I guess\nthe moral of this story is not only that\nRothko rocks, but also that art just gets\nbetter and better the more you experience it.\nWhile I was at the glorious artistic\nMecca that is the Tate Modern, I wandered round the new Turbine Hall installation by Dominique Gonzalez-Foerster. This can be summed up as sci-fi\ngeek art. Ms Dominique has produced\na futuristic dystopia made up of giant\nspiders, glowing green lights and evacuation shelter beds. The beds are littered with sci-fi books and the screen\nat the back shows snippets of scenes\nfrom sci-fi movies.\nIt\u2019s surreal and funky, like the dorky\nlibrary-dwelling kid you went to school\nwith all grown up and taking over the\nworld. Pretty awesome, though it\ncouldn\u2019t hold a candle to that big crack\nin the floor from last time, which I basically wanted to have the babies of.\nMany thanks to all those who keep\nsending in articles without us having to\nbeg for it. We love you, yes we do, and\nwe apologise if we can\u2019t print them all.\nAs always, if anybody else would like to\ncontribute, we will welcome you with\nopen arms at arts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nBook review\npending\nN\now is your chance to\nwitness the work of the\nhat-wearing, semi-sinis-ter physician and anatomist Dr. Gunther von\nHagens. You may have been fortunate\nenough to see his live (in the television sense, obviously) human dissections on Channel Four not so long ago.\nWell, now you can head over to the O2\n(read: Millennium Dome re-branded)\nand wander round a whole exhibition of dead, plasticized bodies\nthat demonstrate the human\nlife cycle and how time\nalters us.\nLet me tell\nyou right now: don\u2019t go to this exhibition if you\u2019re squeamish or have\nfainting inclinations. It really is an entire exhibition of bits of dead bodies.\nThough at the same time I did find the\nbodies oddly unrealistic. The plastina-tion process used to preserve the subjects (which is well explained inside\nthe exhibit) leaves them looking like\nsomebody did actually craft them out\nof lumps of flesh-coloured plastic. The\nprocess also leaves the bodies without\nskin or facial characteristics, so they\nlack any distinguishing features that\nmake them individual. In some cases it\ncould be the same body over and over\nagain in different poses. I had to remind myself constantly that these used\nto be living, breathing people who volunteered themselves for plastination\nand display after they died.\nThere are several things I noticed\nabout the bodies. Firstly, despite lack\nof facial skin, they all retain their eye-brows, eyelashes and lips and have all\nbeen given glass eyes. I found this overwhelmingly creepy. Like something out\nof a horror movie, they are dead but\ncan stare at you with expression. They\nWhy stop at\nhumans? And\nwe know where\nyou\u2019re looking\nHere is somebody, or\nmaybe some bodies, riding\na horsie\n\n"

But\nhow\u2019s this for a criticism: your money\npaid for a movie that\u2019s already showing\nin France, is scheduled in Germany,\nBelgium and Russia but its release date\nstill TBC in the UK!\nThe Meerkats is a new BBC feature\nfilm about \u2013 you guessed it \u2013 meer-kats, the highly social mammal from\nthe deserts of south Africa. After success of the BBC\u2019s \u2018Meerkats Divided\u2019\nand \u2018Meerkats United\u2019 from the early\n1990s and the more recent global success of the Discovery Channel\u2019s \u2018Meerkat Manor\u2019 series it comes as a no-brainer that another meerkat movie\nwould be a good thing to do: after all,\npeople are getting tired of penguins.\nBut there was controversy over this\nmovie from the beginning.\nIt was scheduled for filming at the\nsame time as Discovery\u2019s \u2018Meerkat\nManor: Queen of the Kalahari\u2019, yet another cheesy take on meerkats and a\nprequel to the Meerkat Manor series.\nBoth Discovery and BBC wanted to\nfilm at Cambridge\u2019s Kalahari Meerkat Project in South Africa, but only\nDiscovery got permission and the\nBBC ended up filming on a site some\n50 miles away, at Tswalu, the largest\nprivate wildlife park in South Africa.\nTswalu had the advantage of having\na variety of wildlife including rhinos,\ngiraffes and honey badgers that are not\npresent at the Kalahri Meerkat Project\n(which is set on ranchland). However,\nthere were no tame meerkats there so\nBBC had to recruit some of the former\nvolunteers from the Project, trained\nby Cambridge scientists for research\npurposes, to habituate the meerkats\nso that the BBC could film them from\nup close.

It\nturns out that the chemical makeup of\nthe drink has a ratio of hydrogen, oxygen and carbon atoms which places it\nwithin the \u2018diamond growth region.\u2019\nThe scientists turned to tequila not\nfor its intoxicating quality, but because\nprevious efforts to create diamonds\nfrom organic solutions such as acetone,\nethanol and methanol had proved un-successful.

The young researcher found that the handedness of the\nsnail\u2019s mating behaviour is matched by\nan asymmetry in the brain which is determined by its mother\u2019s genes. Demonstrating that, like humans, pond\nsnails are genetically programmed to\nuse left or right hand sides of the brain.\nPond snails usually have a right\nhanded (dextral) twist to their shells,\nbut occasionally it is left handed (sin-istral). As dextral snails circle clockwise and sinistral circle anticlock-wise, the \u2018mirror image\u2019 snails end up\ncircling each other and the unlucky\npair are frequently unable to mate.\n\u201cThe fact that this specialisation has\nevolved multiple times emphasises its\nimportance for animals,\u201d says Dr Andrew Davidson, Hayley\u2019s supervisor.\nLeft handed\nsnails\nKatie Wookey\nHaving a large waist circumference can\nalmost double your risk of premature\ndeath, warned scientists from here at\nImperial last week. A study of over\n350,000 people from across Europe\nshowed that even if you have a normal body mass index (BMI) and are\ntherefore not considered overweight\nor obese, excess fat around the waist\nbrings serious health risks.\nObesity is currently diagnosed by\nmeasuring BMI, which is known to be\nlinked to mortality risk. However, this\nstudy suggests that the distribution of\nbody fat may be more important than\nBMI. The scientists involved believe\nthat doctors should also record patients\u2019 waist circumference and that\nthis should form a part of regular\nhealth check-ups.\nImperial scientists, with colleagues\nacross Europe, compared people with\nthe same BMI and found a direct correlation between subjects\u2019 waist circumference and their risk of premature\ndeath. In fact, the risk almost doubled\nfor people with a waistline considered\nto be large, compared to those with a\nsmall measurement.

Ultimately, both films were finished at about the same time, although\nthe Discovery crew had to communicate via a single 52kb cable Internet\nconnection with their team back home\n(which they shared with 30 other peo-ple) whilst the BBC had a high-tech\nsatellite internet connection, or so the\nrumour went. Both films were bought\nby the Weinstein Company and they\napparently decided to do a cinema release of only one of the films, although\nboth were originally conceived as\nfeature films for cinema audiences. I\nguess the BBC movie was deemed bet-ter. That doesn\u2019t explain why it\u2019s not\nnarrated by David Attenborough, but\ninstead by the late Paul Newman...

It\u2019s not an usher however, but\nJosie Long herself. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, do you\nmind sharing?\u201d she beams, offering\na collection of folded paper covered\nin her endearing and often hilarious\nscribblings. \u201cOnly I didn\u2019t photocopy\nenough.\u201d\nThis pretty much sums up Josie\u2019s\napproach to comedy. Her props are\nrandom objects from her personal life,\nshe illustrates her points with hand-drawn graphs, and invites a friend to\nembroider handkerchiefs live on stage\nfor the entire evening. Throughout\nthe act she will pause, correct herself,\ncomment on how the jokes are being\nreceived and generally chat with the\naudience. It actually feels a bit like\nyou are watching the director\u2019s commentary of a movie \u2013 whilst trying to\nwatch the movie proper on a separate\nscreen entirely.\nJosie\u2019s latest show is about her new\nfound fascination for science. As a\nchild she felt you had to pick a side\nbetween the arts and sciences. As she\nsays, she went with the \u2018poetry and\nself harm crowd\u2019, because scientists\nare all \u2018nerdy virgins\u2019 - of course. Now\nthat she\u2019s older however, she\u2019s realised\nthere is no such need to close yourself\noff from science. She\u2019s been reading\nabout all manner of subjects, from\nthe Enlightenment to astronomy and\nwhilst the show is far from a lecture it\ndid send me scurrying to Wikipedia to\nread up on some of her references.\nMany stand-up comedians appear\nconstantly miserable, as if the world\nis all too much for them to take and\nonly dry wit will sustain them. Josie on\nthe other hand seems to find delight in\nevery corner of her life, be it watching\nregional news reports, buying a bottle\nof water or gazing into the heavens.\nHer enthusiasm is infectious, and you\ncan\u2019t help but smile when you realise\njust how pleased she was with that last\njoke. This can mean that at times she is\nso eager to get to the next gag that she\nforgets to finish the previous one, but\nthis slightly scatterbrained approach\nsimply adds to the appeal.\nThe show is summed up with Josie\u2019s\nviews on science. It\u2019s not about coming\nup with an idea and saying \u201cthis is the\nJacob Aron truth for all time.\u201d Rather, you should\ntake the view that \u201chey, it may not be\nperfect, but it\u2019s the best we know right\nnow, and maybe someone will coming\nalong and make it better in the future.\u201d\nA pretty good description of the way\nscience works.\nYou\u2019re unlikely to come away from\n\u2018All of the Planet\u2019s Wonders brackets Shown in Detail close brackets\u2019\n(as Josie calls the show) feeling that\nyou\u2019ve learnt something, but you will\ncertainly have been entertained, and\nif you\u2019re lucky some of Josie\u2019s bubbly\nenthusiasm might have rubbed off on\nyou. Do go along - if you don\u2019t get to\nleave with one of the live embroidered\nhandkerchiefs, you\u2019ll at least walk out\nwith a smile on your face.\nThe secret of becoming an astronaut\nis that you have to really, really, really\nwant to be one. Oh yes - and to be considered for the European Space Agency\u2019s 2008 recruitment round currently\nin progress (they recruit only every 15\nyears or so) you should also be at least\nthe right age and nationality.\nWe were told this tonight by French\nastronaut Jean-Francois Clervoys during an event at the London Science\nMuseum\u2019s Dana Centre. Three time\nshuttle astronaut Clervoys, who has\nspent 675 hours in space, was joined\nby a panel of experts in space history,\nmedicine and psychology - to educate\nand entertain the forty or so of us who\nhad volunteered for \u2018Space Station\nDana\u2019.\nIt wasn\u2019t all one way though. Armed\nwith our Astronaut Training and Selection Manuals, we split into teams\nto engage in a range of psychologi-cal, physical, and knowledge tests that\nwere both fun and sufficiently taxing\nto give us a flavour of what the Right\nStuff is all about.\nConsider a potential manned flight\nto Mars for example. As it takes 20\nminutes for communications to travel from Earth to Mars, a problem on\nthe spacecraft cannot be fixed via an\niterative chat with the engineers back\nhome, so our psychological test was\nbuilt around getting things right first\ntime through good planning and au-thority, balanced with team working\nand individual respect.\nAs it turns out, you don\u2019t need to be\nsuper-human to be an astronaut. You\nwill typically be 27-37 years of age; not\nbecause you automatically die in space\nafter age 37, but rather your sponsors\nare looking for a sensible number of\nworking years for their investment.\nAfter that it helps to have a PhD in a\nrelevant discipline, to be able to speak\nRussian, to pass a raft of psychological\ntests, and to be reasonably fit. Again,\nthe fitness issues are more about you\nnot falling out of the programme and\nyour career with ill health, rather\nthan the ability to withstand physical\nextremes.\nThose selected move onto an 18\nmonth basic training in Europe, the\nUSA, and Russia. Then you\u2019re on your\nway to the dream.\nAnd that\u2019s how the memory of the\nadventure seemed to Jean-Francois as\nhe described the effect of dimming the\nshuttle\u2019s cabin lights with the sun and\nearth behind the spacecraft, and looking at the \u201cmilky way like a highway\u201d in\nthe total blackness of space.\nDr Tim Jones\ning heart disease and type two dia-betes, are well publicised, as well as\nthe estimated 30,000 deaths it causes\neach year. The scientists believe the\nincreased mortality risk caused by\nexcess abdominal fat may be due to\nthe tissue releasing chemicals and\nmessenger substances, such as hor-mones, which contribute to the development of chronic diseases including\ncardiovascular diseases and cancers.\nAlthough they did not investigate the\nreasons why some people have a larger\nwaistline than others, they believe that\na sedentary lifestyle, poor diet and\ngenetic predisposition are significant\nfactors.\nProfessor Elio Riboli from Imperial\nsaid they were surprised that waist size\nhad such an impact on people\u2019s health;\n\u201cAlthough smaller studies have suggested a link between mortality and\nwaist size, we were surprised to see the\nwaist size having such a powerful effect on people\u2019s health and premature\ndeath. Our study shows that accumulating excess fat around your middle\ncan put your health at risk even if your\nweight is normal based on body mass\nindex scores.\u201d\ndid some tests. We were in doubt over\nwhether the great amount of chemicals\npresent in tequila, other than water and\nethanol, would contaminate or obstruct\nthe process. It turned out to be not so.\nThe results were amazing, same as with\nthe ethanol and water compound, we\nobtained almost spherical shaped diamonds of nanometric size. There is no\ndoubt; tequila has the exact proportion\nof carbon, hydrogen and oxygen atoms\nnecessary to form diamonds.\u201d\nThe diamonds were made by heating\ntequila to transform it into a gas and\nthen heating this gas further to break\ndown the molecular structure. The\nresult: solid diamond crystals, about\n100-400 nanometres in size. They\ncould be used to coat cutting tools or\nas high-power semiconductors, radiation detectors and optical-electronic\ndevices.\nmmmm Tequilla.... Golden Tequilla\nThis guy no longer can find belts that fit... he requires a tape measure.\nAwww aren\u2019t they sweet?\nBritish Baffoon\nA family of Suricate... whatever that is.\nThey\u2019re behind you...\n\n"
