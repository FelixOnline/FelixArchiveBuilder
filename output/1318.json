    "content": "By Mili Josson\nThe undefeated IC ladies\u2019\ntennis team went to\nSouthampton for the first\nround of the knockout league.\nWe were promised the luxury\nof indoor courts, which was\nan exciting prospect since\nwe are normally playing in\nthe rain at Teddington! But\non arrival we found that they\nhad double booked the courts\nand the boys got the indoor,\nso we were left with playing\noutdoors in the snow!\nEveryone was quite anxious\non the IC team, as Emma,\nthe captain, recognised the\nSouthampton number one\nwho had been a former\nBritish player! Nevertheless,\nthe spirits were high as the\ndoubles got underway.\nThings couldn\u2019t have gone\nbetter as Mili and Lucinda\ntrounced the Southampton\nsecond pair, 8-2. Shortly after-wards, Emma and Caroyl\nput in a repeat performance,\nshaming the opposition\u2019s\nnumber one pair.\nThe Southampton girls\nlooked scared and visibly\nshaken, which may have been\ndue to the snow and the freezing conditions! After a short\nbreak that consisted of hot\nchocolate and \u2018giant\u2019 cookies,\nthe singles got underway.\nAgain IC kicked ample ass\nwith Caroyl, Mili and Sarah\nfinishing quickly, having won\ntheir singles. Mili aced her\nopponent and Sarah outclassed hers 6-1, 6-0 (ouch).\nThe last singles to finish was\nEmma versus Southampton\u2019s\nstar player. The rallies were\nlong and intense. Emma\ncame up with some amazing\nshots, and she put up a valiant fight unfortunately losing\nin the end.\nOverall IC girls won 5-1, and\nare now through to the next\nround: the quarter-finals!\nTENNIS\nTennis ladies still\nundefeated\nThe Imperial women\u2019s tennis team\nSPORT sport.felix@ic.ac.uk\nwww.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 3 March 2005\n22\nSponsored by\nLSE Men\u2019s 1st 0\nImperial Men\u2019s 1st 2\nBy Pat Farr\n\u201cAbsolutely massive boys,\u201d\nremarked a hamstrung\nStar-Nosed Mole via e-mail\nmidweek; not, for once, on\nthe size of his Iranian conk,\nbut rather the importance\nof the coming Saturday\u2019s\ngame. The injured captain\namongst them, this was to\nbe a swansong for members\nof the Imperial old guard on\nthe Berrylands turf, and what\nfiner occasion than a crucial\nquarter-final cup tie.\nThe sides shared the spoils\n1-1 in the League fixture\nearlier in the season, in a\ngame Imperial largely domi-nated, but the nature of this\ntie saw both teams set out\ntentatively, with very little\nin the way of possession.\nNeither could be faulted for\ncommitment, however, with a\nfired-up General Von Berkles\nflying in early doors, supported on cue by the Bull, a\ntenacious Wes, and a trademark brutal challenge from\nHighland Cattle fugitive JR\n(the farmer called, he does\nwant you back).\nKimmo The Great took a\nnasty elbow to the nose midway through the first half.\nMeanwhile, attempts to play\nto feet were oft stifled, and\nthe half remained a scrappy\naffair. No clear-cut chances\nfell to either side, both being\nreduced to long-range efforts\nin the way of attacking threat.\nHalf time came quickly, but\na motivated team talk saw\nImperial really up for the\nfight after the break.\nThe second 45 started much\nakin to the first, although\nthere were gradual signs of\nthe game starting to open\nup. 15 minutes in and it was\nTweed von Cragnuts\u2019 turn to\ntake a blow to the nose. Some\nbrief treatment later and the\nWoodcock, trooper that he\nis, returned to the field to\nwhip in a speciality corner\nfrom the right. It was from\nsuch a delivery, just minutes\nlater, that Imperial nicked the\nopener. Cragnuts\u2019s corner\nwas too hot to handle for the\nLSE keeper, the ball dropped\nto Goatanayanananan and\nWednesday\u2019s Medic-spanker\ncontinued his rich vein of\nscoring with a prod home.\nJust the break Imperial\nneeded.\nLSE pressed hard in the\nfollowing spell, but Imperial\nresistance was organised\nand persistent. Timur, who\nnarrowly avoided having his\nentire arm bitten off by an\nangry tapir in the warm-up\n(I arrived on the pitch late,\nso I may have misheard),\nand Mathan continued to\nbite heels up top, an example followed feverishly by\nthose behind. Super Vasquez\nand the Pat Farr (back four)\ncontinued to soak up LSE\npressure, presenting several\nopportunities for Imperial on\nthe break.\nMarzo-Munooooooz came\nclose on a couple of occasions,\nyet the best chance of the\ngame followed dogged work\nfrom JR down the right. His\nlooped centre saw a police\nline-up of Mathan, Wes and\nan arriving Berksy, all of\nwhom had time to fold away\ntheirdeckchairsand putdown\nThe Economist (Woodcock\u2019s\nsubscription kicking in)\nbefore tripping over each\nother, the ball, the \u2018keeper\nand one LSE defender in a\ncartoon-style dust-cloud.\nThe ball ended up with the\n\u2018keeper. Somehow.\nIncreased determination\nnot to rue this opportunity\nculminated in a defensive\nclearance, leaving Mathan to\njostle with a lone defender\noutside LSE\u2019s box. The\nfleet-footed bearded dance-machine got the better of his\nadversary and coolly slotted\nhome to provide much welcome breathing distance for\na focused Imperial outfit, who\nstayed right on top of their\ngame for the remaining 15\nminutes. Final whistle, 2-0,\nSpiceworld.\nNot hardcore super sex,\nbut nevertheless a job very,\nvery well done. As the triumph settled in, Kimmo\nemerged with a broken conk\nof Steve Bruce-like chican-ery, the veterans enjoyed one\nlast fat shot of ale at the local\nBerrylands hostelry, and now\nImperial march on with great\nmomentum into their semifinal clash.\nRest assured, Saturday\u2019s\nopponents St George\u2019s will\nalso be rendered flat-footed\nlike a platypus, just without\nthe egg-laying and horny\nspurs. Peace.\nFOOTBALL\nAbsolutely massive football\nUnited Hospitals Head\nBy Ben Anstiss\nIt has been a common sight\non the embankment of late:\nthe IC novice first eight paddling away from Putney early\non a bitterly cold February\nafternoon, but this was to be\nunlike any regular Sunday\nouting. Hot off their first win\nat Peterborough Head of the\nNene some weeks earlier, the\nfocus was firmly on the task\nahead: the United Hospitals\nHead.\nIt would be healthy competition with all the London\nMedical Schools represented\nby boats ranging from novice\nto top senior crews. Having\nbeen offered an invitational\nplace just 72 hours previously,\nthe crew was excited to be\nracing again, if for no other\nreason than to break up the\nseemingly endless training\nschedule set by their illustrious coach Ed Johnson whose\nsupport and guidance they\nwould have to do without on\nthe day as he pursued his\ninternational ambitions with\nthe GB squad in Seville.\nHaving made the journey\nto Chiswick through some\nrough water and cold winds,\nthe crew were all glad of the\nopportunity to get out of the\nboat at UL for a quick stretch\nand some banter with their\nmedic counterparts. It also\ngave the ideal opportunity\nto relieve the boat of some\nexcessweight,consisting,asit\nturned out, of half of Charlie\u2019s\nwinter wardrobe (we let him\nkeep the head-band!)\nA little over two hours after\nleaving Putney the boat was\nheading further upstream, for\nmany of the eight in un-char-tered water, to Isleworth and\nthe start line at pink lodge.\nSitting at the back of the\nfield, where we were to start\nfrom, everyone was pretty\nrelaxed, finding plenty of\ntime for the power nap that\nis customary of the pre-race\npreparation of late! We all\nfound ourselves slightly more\nalert, however, as we watched\nthe top GKT (last years win-ners) and Imperial Medics\nboats row past during their\nwarm up. We agreed that\nthey both looked rather good.\nNeither boat stayed in our\nminds for long though as we\nbegan to concentrate on the\nrace plan and, perhaps more\nimportantly, on the extremely\nattractive blonde female that\nwas occupying the two seat of\na RUMS novice boat!\nWe started the race amid\na deluge of hail and snow (it\nhad been sunny with blue\nsky\u2019s less than two minutes\nbefore!) with choppy water\nthrown in for good meas-ure! Early on we effortlessly\nmoved past the crew immediately ahead of us, and despite\na few minor discrepancies in\ntechnique that had the boat\nunsettled for a few strokes,\nwe swiftly settled into the\nrace. A third of the distance\ngone and the water became\nmuch calmer, the weather\nconditions rapidly improved\nand with that the boat moved\non as we approached Kew\nBridge. A masterful display\nof coxing, of which we have\nbecome accustomed, saw the\nboat move out of the stream\nbefore the bridge and with a\npush called we undertook two\ncrews majestically as we flew\nunder the central arch.\nWith shouts of support from\na mass of spectators on the\nbridge to spur us on, using\nthe two boats in our wake to\npush away from and with the\nRUMS blonde to impress, we\nput the hammer down. The\nboat was flying. UL boat house\ncame and went and with one\nlast big effort we increased\nthe stroke rate and pushed\nthrough the finish line under\nChiswick Bridge, passing a\nfourth crew as we did so. The\nwhole crew was pretty quiet,\ntestament to the amount of\nenergy that had just drained\nfrom of our bodies. Being a\nhead race we were none the\nwiser as to how well we had\ndone, but it felt pretty good\nand we were confident of giving a respectable account of\nourselves.\nWespuntheboatandstarted\nthe final leg of our 32km outing back to Putney and more\nfamiliar waters. I dare say\nthose final kilometres would\nhave felt all the more effortless had we of heard the\nresults being announced back\nin Chiswick; we had clocked\nthe fastest time of the day!\nAlbeit only officially winning\nthe invitational category, we\ncouldn\u2019t quite believe that\nwe had beaten every senior\nboat on the water; it had been\ntalked about in the changing\nroom before hand but not put\nforward as a serious possi-bility! In a month that sees\nall self-respecting boat clubs\nbuilding up for The Head of\nthe River in March, we really\ncouldn\u2019t have asked for a better confidence boost, and for\nthat matter reassurance that\nthe last three months of hard\nwinter training are coming\nto fruition. We can only hope\nthat our success on the water\ncontinues and that March 19\ndelivers the same feeling of\ncontentment when we strive\nfor the novice title on the\nTideway.\nThanks to Jo Hardwick\n(ICSMBC Captain) and all\nthose involved in organising\nthe event for the invitation\nand hospitality at UL on the\nday; it was much appreci-ated. Congratulations to the\nICSMBC novice boat on winning the novice category.\nIC Novice eight: Cox, Mike\n\u2018Killer\u2019 Whale, from stroke:\nMarc Vonk, Tom Bertenshaw,\nCharlie Targett-Adams, Tim\nJagelman, Andy Kinloch,\nMathieu Poitrat, Jon Cooper,\nPeter Milton.\nROWING\nBeating every boat\n\n"

    "content": "www.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 3 March 2005\n10\nFEATURE felix@ic.ac.uk\nCharity fashion show\nBy Henri Ozarovski\nMany prominent designers were\non display at the annual Imperial\nCollege charity fashion show, a must\nfor all fashion followers and trend-setters. This year\u2019s neoteric event\nstemmed from an ongoing tradition\nof munificence and charitable donation from family, friends and guests.\nIn this age of charity events that\nraise very little, the event was organised on the premise that 100% of\nthe ticket price would be donated to\nthe chosen foundation. In this case,\nthe proceeds of the fashion show\nwere given to the Macmillan Cancer\nRelief foundation.\nSponsorships came from Deloitte,\nCreative Labs and Shell, while gift\nbag assortments were provided by\nSephora and Sisley. Chic Zen MP3\nplayers were up for grabs, as were\na trip to Morocco, signed Chelsea\nshirts and a day trip to Paris courtesy of Bombardier aerospace.\nThe Sketch Gallery, famous for its\nelegance and exclusivity, was ideal\nfor the sophisticated young academic crowd that attended.\n32 male and female student models\nunderwent a formidable transformation process to add elegance to the\ndefile. The choreography was put\ntogether by head organiser, Natasha\nWiggins, a medical student who\ndedicated the most part of her last\nfew months to the coordination and\npreparation of the event.\nThe fashion show committee, consisting of an eclectic mix of engi-neers, scientists and medical stu-dents, put great effort into the intricate details of the show, from the gift\nbags right through to the gift tree\nenvelopes. This ambitiously tenacious committee would not consider\ngood as an answer but rather perfection as a necessity.\nClothing lines included the trendy\nmakes Diesel 55, High Jinks, Pijja,\nTM Lewin, Kew, Laundry Industry,\nand So Shei, the more exclusive collections from Harvey Nichols, Calvin\nKlein, Formal Attire, Philipa Lepley,\nand the avant-garde Voyage.\nThe theme of the event, \u201cIt\u2019s only a\nmatter of time\u201d, seemed appropriate\nin its relevance because only with\nsustained investment will a cure for\nthis widespread disease be found.\nThe show was split into two parts,\nallowing guests to absorb the assorted collections and the diversity of\nthemes.\nThe first collection, Freetime, was\nbased on urban streetwear but was\ndescribed as \u2018simply offbeat\u2019 and fusing various cultural influences. The\nnext collection, Daytime, took formal\noffice wear as a starting point and\nturned it into something clearly better suited for the catwalk.\nThe first half ended with a section\nentitled Playtime, which many of\nthe audience members seemed to\nfind the most captivating, although\nthis reporter cannot help but think\nthat those individuals\u2019 attention was\nfocused less on what the models\nwere wearing than on what they\nwere not.\nThe second half commenced with\nSometimes, an impressively elegant\nand graceful line of wedding dresses\ndesigned by Philippa Lepley and\ntuxedos from Formal Attire. This\nwas followed by Ourtime, designed\nby Imperial\u2019s students, and finally\nNighttime, where a selection of cocktail dresses and evening wear were\ndisplayed.\nThe adorning finishing touches\nincluded a diverse lighting scheme\nfor each line of clothing and a\nwell suited musical playlist which\nincluded an assortment of neo and\nretro sounds. From the well known\nBaywatch theme song to Moloko or\nthe soothing tranquillity of Tracy\nChapman, the artists were specifically chosen to complement the various clothing lines.\nAs important and sometimes forgotten are the indispensable backstage crew. Makeup artists and hair\nstylists from Toni & Guy were complementing the line-up of outfits,\nwhilst all committee staff members\nwere rushing around fixing loose\nends, dressing models and setting\nthe stage for each part of the show.\nThe show combined an unforgettable evening with making a differ-ence. Both doctors and scientists of\nthe future have collaborated to raise\nmoney for a disease which requires\ncommitted long term funding.\nIt would seem appropriate to end\nthis article by thanking those individuals who sought to make this event\nmemorable and enjoyable for all.\nThe support and participation at\nthis year\u2019s event will continue to\nraise the fashion show\u2019s profile for\nyears to come, and will ferment an\nongoing tradition of giving. Let us\ncontinue this tradition and wish the\nbest of luck to future organisers of\nthe show.\n\n"

He then proceeded\nto take items from unlocked\nrooms, but was caught doing\nso and was then chased\nout of the building. Despite\nCollege Security being called,\nthe intruder managed to\nescape whilst the security\nguards were investigating\nanother area of the hall.\nAfter being chased around\nPrinces Gardens and South\nKensington by residents,\nthe man finally got away by\njumping on a bus as it\nstopped at nearby traffic\nlights.\nAccording to one eyewit-ness, \u201cThe intruder came\nrunning down the stairs\nwhile security officers were\nupstairs looking for him. He\nthen pushed his way past a\nfemale student at the door\nand escaped\u201d. Fortunately,\nno-one was seriously injured\nin the incident, and all stolen\nitems were recovered as they\nwere dropped in the chase.\nThese included his hat and\ncoat, which contained more\nstolen items, suggesting\nto police that the man is a\nregular criminal in the local\narea.\nIt is not the first time that\nLinstead hall \u2013 or halls of\nresidences in general \u2013 have\nbeen targeted. Terry Branch,\nthe College\u2019s Chief Security\nOfficer, told Felix: \u201cWe believe\nhe [the thief] did exactly the\nsame thing at Linstead Hall\nearlier this term. We also\nbelieve he is the same man\nwho was arrested for breaking into Beit Hall in 2002 and\nimprisoned for two years\u201d.\nDetails of the latest incident\nwere captured on CCTV, and\nSecurity and police hope that\nan arrest will follow.\nMr Branch explained that\nstudents should never let\nanyone they don\u2019t know into\nhalls, and stressed the importance of reporting anything\nout of the ordinary to College\nSecurity immediately: \u201cIf you\nsee someone suspicious in\nor around halls of residence,\ndon\u2019t confront them, call\nSecurity and we\u2019ll respond\nevery time.\u201d He added that\nit was crucial to describe the\nincident accurately, stating\nwhether or not you believe\nthere are still intruders in the\nbuilding. Security officers are\nthought to have been unaware that the intruder was\nstill present on their arrival\nat Linstead.\nThere have been reports\nthat Security guards went up\nin the lift when they arrived at\nLinstead, allowing the intruder to run down the stairs and\nescape. Mr Branch was unable to comment on that, but\nassured Felix that Security\nwere \u201cputting in a higher\npresence at residences\u201d.\n\u25cf State of the Union,\npage 6\nVigilance urged after Linstead thefts\nLinstead Hall, where a student allowed a thief to enter last week\n\n"

We\u2019re pretty far out of central London, and\nwhen we leave halls most of us end\nup living even further west and/or\nsouth, so nocturnal excursions often\ninvolve a fairly long trip \u2018uptown\u2019\nand an even longer one back in the\nsmall hours.\nLucky for us then, that one of\nLondon\u2019s hottest house clubs,\nNeighbourhood, is just a few stops\naway over in Ladbroke Grove. The\nclub is the baby of Everything But\nthe Girl\u2019s Ben Watt \u2013 a top notch\nhouse DJ and producer himself\n\u2013 and attracts such big names as\n4 Hero, Lottie and Norman Jay to\nname but a few, as well as regular\nsets from Mr Watt.\nThis Friday, the man at the top\nof the bill is Mylo, who is currently\nriding the wave of success of his LP\nDestroy Rock and Roll.\nOriginally from the Isle of Skye,\nMylo (aka Myles MacInnes) was\nan undergraduate at Oxford before\nembarking on a PhD in Philosophy\nat UCLA, California.\nHis musical influences are many\nand eclectic \u2013 from Squarepusher\nto Serge Gainsburg to Daft Punk\nand Kraftwerk. This variety shows\nthrough in his music, which is funky,\nelectronic and has been filling\ndancefloors all over for a good year\nor so already.\nCategorising music feels like such\na bad thing to do, since at the end of\nthe day genres are mostly a load of\nbollocks, but in this case it\u2019s worth\na mention. This is because Mylo\nseems to be part of the latest \u2018cool\u2019\ngenre to be proposed: \u2018Nu Electro\u2019\n(sic).\nNow, don\u2019t go thinking I\u2019m the type\nof ponce who goes around championing the latest buzzword \u2013 I\u2019m\nmerely here to inform, not influ-ence.

The\nmain record they were trying to sell\nunder this banner was Mylo\u2019s Drop\nThe Pressure, with the rest being\na similar electro/house/pop selec-tion. Whilst this latest pigeonholing\nmight not actually be anything particularly new, it does provide us with\na useful umbrella under which to\nthrow various artists, who all seem\nto be making radio-friendly, dance-floor-friendly, exciting new music, of\nwhich Mylo is most definitely one.\nFriday promises to be a top night,\nwith Geddes (of Mulletover) and\nDonkey Boss also on the bill, so go\nwest and you\u2019re in for a treat.\nFelix is giving you the chance to go\nfor free!

The\nnovel is a modern masterwork written by a walking contradiction of an\nauthor, doctor of journalism Hunter\nS Thompson, who died last Sunday\nof an apparent suicide. The motives\nbehind his death appear at first hazy\nand indeed it took this writer several days to even believe it, but\nThompson (67) was a person who\nlived every moment of each day to\nits fullest; if he could no longer blow\nstuff up, drink heavily, take copious\namounts of drugs and still write,\nthen what was the point?\nThompson was born in Louisville,\nKentucky, to a relatively normal\nmiddle class family, but would go on\nto champion a new form of reportage known as Gonzo journalism, a\nmethod that puts the writer at the\nheart of his very own story.\nAt the age of nine, Thompson\nhad his first encounter with the US\nestablishment, one that would affect\nthe rest of his life. In an elaborate\nplan of revenge on a local bus driv-er, young Hunter and a few of his\nchildhood friends tipped over a mailbox in the path of their school bus;\nshortly afterwards an FBI officer\nturned up at the Thompson household asking some rather pointed\nquestions. It was after calling the\nFBI man\u2019s bluff that Thompson\nwould embark on his remarkable\ncrusade against authority, later\nbecoming a counterculture hero\ncommentating at the scene on everything from the rise of motorcycle\ngangs to the disastrous rise and fall\nof the drug culture and the freedom\nmovements of the sixties.\nThompson became a politics junkie after being caught up and beaten\nby the police in a protest outside the\nChicago democratic convention in\n1968. The experience traumatised\nhim into championing civil liberties\nin his writing and even running for\nsheriff in his hometown of Aspen.\nHe soon met his nemesis in the form\nof Richard Nixon: \u201cHe could shake\nyour hand and stab you in the back\nat the same time\u201d.\nIn the following decades,\nThompson wrote strangely accurate predictions on American poli-tics, becoming one of the best and\nmost celebrated critics of the Nixon,\nClinton and Bush governments. In\nhis most recent articles, he detailed\nan America ruled by post 9/11 fear\nand total social collapse: \u201cIn four\nshort years he [George W Bush] has\nturned our country from a prosperous nation at peace into a desperately indebted nation at war\u201d.\nHunter S Thompson was a man\nof excess, almost constantly fuelled\nby drugs and booze, forever missing deadlines and a self-proclaimed\ngun fanatic, yet the legacy he leaves\nwill be always be remembered. Dr\nGonzo was the giant of American lit-erature, paranoid eccentric, champion of excess or maybe just the last\nof a dying breed of outlaw writers\nwho struck out against the system\nand won.\nIf you would like to learn more\nabout the man himself, I would sug-gest:\n\u25cf The Great Shark Hunt:\nStrange Tales from a Strange\nTime (1979)\n\u25cf Fear and Loathing in Las\nVegas (1971)\n\u25cf Kingdom of fear: the\njourney of a star-crossed\nchild (2002)\n\u25cf The Curse of Lono (1983)\n\u25cf The Rum Diary (1999)\nMichael Healy\nHunter S Thompson\n1937-2005\nIf you want to get involved with Nightlife, email Simon at clubs.felix@ic.ac.uk\n\n"

    "content": "EXHIBITION\nThe exhibition\u2019s official title is Turks:\nA Journey of a Thousand Years,\n600-1600, which give one a good idea\nof what one is going to see.\nWhat you will see housed in the\nAcademy\u2019s main galleries is a vast\ncollection of over 350 items on loan\nfrom a number of institutions from\n11 countries. Of course, most of the\npieces on show are from Turkey,\nprimarily from the Topkapi Saray\nMuseum and the Museum of Turkish\nand Islamic Art in Istanbul, and\nmany have never been seen outside\nof Turkey. This is the first exhibition\nat the Royal Academy to be made\nup principally of Islamic art since\nthe 1931 International Exhibition of\nPersian Art, so it is definitely not an\nopportunity to be missed.\nThe route through the exhibition\nhas been planned to take visitors\nchronologically through the development of the culture and the art\nof the Turks. Unlike the Carlsberg\nexhibition, there is no way of getting even vaguely lost. The journey\nbegins with the nomadic tribe of\nthe Uyghurs in Central Asia in the\nseventh century; the Uyghurs\u2019 lands\ncoincided with the route of the Silk\nRoad and from this they prospered.\nOn show are textiles and frescoes,\nreflecting the richness and variety of cultures and religions with\nwhich the Uyghurs interacted. The\ninfluence of the far east, in particular China, is clearly visible here\nand, surprisingly, remains so right\nthrough the entire exhibition.\nThe journey then moves on to\nexplore another nomadic tribe, the\nSeljuks. They originate in Central\nAsia but eventually manage to\nexpand their area of influence to the\neastern Mediterranean; this is the\nfirst time that the exhibition crosses\ninto the geographical territory that\nis now modern Turkey. The Seljuks\nsweep westwards from 1040, coming\nthrough Iraq and Iran. It was on this\nwestward drive that the end of the\nnomadic life began for the Turkic\ntribes as they adopted many Iranian\ninstitutions, established their system of government and became\ngreat patrons of the arts; for this\nwe are grateful, otherwise the offerings on show here would be of a far\nlesser volume and calibre.\nThe Seljuks eventually succumbed\nto the great Mongol onslaught.\nAlthough this had something of a\nhalting effect on the Turkic tribes\u2019\nsponsorship of the arts, it was not\na fatal stroke. This was the catalyst\nfor the rise of the Ottoman Empire\nunder the leadership of Tamerlane\nin the 14th century. Tamerlane managed to finally fuse the nomadic\nCentral Asian culture with the settled culture of Iran. Islam became\nthe religion of the state; learning,\narchitecture and art thrived. As we\nknow, the Byzantine Empire fell to\nthe Ottomans, whose influence at\none point reached as far west as the\nBalkans.\nHowever, while the historical\nbackground is very interesting, it\nis, after all, the art for which one\ngoes to such exhibitions! On show\nare impressively preserved carpets,\nintricately and sumptuously decorated kaftans belonging to Ottoman\nemperors, swords and helmets, jewelled bowls and pieces from the\nlargest collection of porcelain outside of China. While all of these\npieces are all stunning, my particular favourites were the illustrations\nof Siyah Qalem, the mosaic doors by\nthe architect Sinan and in particular\nthe beautifully illuminated Qurans\non display.\nThe works by Siyah Qalem, otherwise known as \u2018Mohamed of the\nBlack Pen\u2019, are a real coup for the\nRoyal Academy. They have never\nbeen seen out of Turkey and the\nremaining pieces can be viewed\nalmost in their entirety. The drawings date from the Seljuk period and\ndepict the illustrator\u2019s travels and\ninterpretations of a number of leg-ends. They are wonderful for their\nbreadth of content, but in particular\nfor their detail and stylistic variety.\nWhile by the time that Siyah Qalem\nwas working, the Seljuks were\nalready well on their way west, the\ninfluence of the Far East is still very\npalpable.\nIf you went to the illustrated\nmanuscripts exhibition at the Royal\nacademy last year, or even if in\nretrospect you think it may have\nbeen interesting, I would definitely\nurge you to go to the Turks show\nto see the beautiful work that has\nbeen done in the decoration of the\nQurans on show, not to mention the\nillustrated books of poetry that are\nalso there. The gorgeous geometric\npatterns that are present in the\nillustration of the Qurans can also\nbeen seen to fantastic effect on the\nhuge wooden doors by Sinan for\nthe Sultan Murad III. Dating from\nc. 1578, the doors are two and a\nhalf metres tall and are inscribed\nand decorated purely in wood. Sinan\nused wood in the same way that different coloured marbles have been\nused throughout Europe to decorate and depict patterns; the effect\nis stunning.\nI must say that I have few complaints about this exhibition. It is\nhuge, so I wouldn\u2019t suggest going if\nyou\u2019re not feeling energetic, but it is\nalso highly enlightening. However,\nthere is always one thing about exhibitions these days that never fails to\nannoy me immensely: audioguides.\nThey\u2019re everywhere, galleries and\nhistorical monuments, and probably\nother places that I wouldn\u2019t care\nto explore. They\u2019re not particularly\nenriching, they go on for ever, tell\nyou stuff you never wanted to know\nand if you did, you could have found\nin a book quite easily, force you\nto follow somebody else\u2019s predetermined course, and most irritatingly\nof all they always have you stop\nin front of the tiniest pieces in an\nexhibition, building up a huge crowd\nand preventing any other poor souls\nfrom seeing those items.\nWhatever happened to independent study? If you are really that\ninterested about an item why not\nsearch for information yourself \u2013 I\nassure you it\u2019s far more rewarding,\nand if you really must have it spoon\nfed to you, buy the catalogue, go on\na gallery tour, attend an event linked\nto the exhibition or even begin some\ncorrespondence with the exhibition\ncurator if you must!\nApartfromtheobviouspaincaused\nto me by my fellow patrons\u2019 reliance on audioguides, the exhibition\nwas really an enjoyable experience.\nThankfully, the Royal Academy does\nnow open late, up until 10pm, on\nSaturdays as well as Fridays, so\nthere are now even more opportunities to go and get some culture.\nPaola Smith\nArts Editor\nTurks\nCloses 12 April\nRoyal Academy of Art\nPicadilly, W1\nArts arts.felix@ic.ac.uk\nwww.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 3 March 2005 15\nTurkish Delight\nAfter you get over the pun, do go see the treasures of a civilisation\nJewelled censer, Ming Dynasty\nTheatre north and south of the river\nSome curious titles and well-worn plots, Tatum Fjerstad reviews\nPLAY REVIEWS\nBased on the novels by Philip\nPullman, this two-part production,\ntotalling over six hours of performance time, is best described as a\nspectacular sensory overload.\nPhilip Pullman is known for \u2018stealing\u2019 themes from other authors and\nin the His Dark Materials trilogy, if\nyou take a look, you will see everything from Shakespeare to Chekhov\nto Dickens.\nHis Dark Materials is a coming\nof age experience for the central\ncharacters, Will and Lyra. The play\nbegins in Oxford, but it\u2019s immediately apparent that this Oxford is not\nthe same as the Oxford we are familiar with. As Will and Lyra meet and\nexperience danger, fear, excitement\nand friendship, they are constantly\nin search of answers. The queries\nchange, but the search for answers\nis always prevalent.\nEach level and pocket of space is\nused wisely by the National Theatre.\nIn the six hours of watching this\ntreasure, there were only about five\nscene settings that repeated them-selves. The lighting and sound was\nvirtually flawless. Each scene transition was seamless, thanks to the\nwork of a dedicated technical staff.\nEach performer, including the\nspectacular puppeteers and their\npuppets, had obviously taken the\ntime to carefully craft his or her\ncharacter. His Dark Materials is\nappropriate for ages 12 to 82, and\nhas something different to offer for\neach audience member.\nIf you\u2019re unfamiliar with the books,\nit\u2019s a good idea to do a Google search\nfor Philip Pullman before you go,\nand read a synopsis of the books so\nthat you know what to expect.\nPart I has been sold out until the\nend of the run, but there are returns\nand other options for getting tickets\nif desired. The final performances\ntake place on 2 April. This run will\nnot be extended and there are no\nplans to revive the show.\nIt\u2019s one hellish winter day in the\nrural Ireland community of the Bog\nof Cats. Hester Swane, played by\nHolly Hunter, has been abandoned\nby the father of her child whom\nshe is still deeply in love with. This\nparticular day is the day he plans\nto marry a young girl with a rich\nfather. Hester tries everything in\nher power to get him back, whilst\nresisting the efforts of all those who\nwant her to leave the Bog of Cats\nforever.\nWritten in 1998 by Marina Carr,\nBy the Bog of Cats is a respectable\npiece. It\u2019s not really worth the West\nEnd ticket price, but it will entertain for a few hours. If you aren\u2019t\nadjusted to thick Irish accents done\nby Americans, the first 20 minutes\nof the show might be a bit hard to\nunderstand, as it was for me. But I\ndidn\u2019t miss out on a whole lot. The\nstoryline is very easy to follow. The\nending is most predictable, but carried out swiftly and successfully.\nThis is mediocrity at its best. It\u2019s\na nice experience, but it\u2019s nothing to\nget excited about. No rushing to the\ntheatre is required, but if you\u2019ve got\na few extra pounds lying around and\nyou feel like seeing something in the\nWest End, try this... it\u2019s not going to\nhurt you.\n\u25cf Details of both theatres\u2019 programmes are available on their\nrespective websites.

But a stroke\nof luck had occurred a few\nhours before, as Nigel, who\nhad turned up to play for CSM\nas a former student of the\ngod-awful hole and was now\na RSM MSc student, was not\nrequired by CSM and would\nplay for his new home.\nThe other reluctant stand-in was caught lurking in the\nhalls: Terrence, also an RSM\nstudent. So the battle lines\nwere drawn.\nCamborne supporters\noutnumbered RSM 4-1, but\nthis wasn\u2019t to be the result.\nTerrence lost in straight sets\nbut captain Tom Hawkins\ndemolished his opponent.\nNewly acquired RSM student\nNigel was to deliver a crushing blow to Camborne, beating them 9-1 9-4 to remind\nthem of what they had lost.\nWith two games left, victory in either would bring\ntriumph, but unfortunately\nRob Thomas was beaten in\na last second tie-breaker. Up\nstepped George Hutson, who,\ndespite the pressure, crushed\nhis opponent like an ant under\na stampede of zebras. Victory\nwas RSM\u2019s, and the quality\nsquash team T-shirts made\nby Tom added insult to the\nragamuffin CSM squad.\nRSM Women 1\nCSM Women 4\nBy Rachel Kershaw\nThe day started in a sleepy\nstate at 8am, sitting on a\ncoach outside the RSM waiting for our 13th player to turn\nup (maybe that was an omen\nfor later). We eventually had\nto set off late without her.\nStepping off the coach at\nHarlington was a definite\nwake-up call \u2013 stepping out\nto the cold, realising what we\nwere letting ourselves in for.\nCamborne were already there\nposing for team photos so we\ndidn\u2019t have time to do a full\nwarm-up, let alone practice.\nA quick group huddle and the\ngame was underway.\nCamborne started strongly\nbut we matched them in pace\nand skill. Some tight defending prevented Camborne\nscoring early on, but they\nfinally broke the seal five\nminutes later by putting one\nneatly past Suzie in goal.\nThe Camborne cheers\nonly spurred on the RSM\nfurther and soon the play\nwas mostly up at their end.\nThe accurate passing from\nSusie and Heather in midfield\nallowed some superb running\nup the wings by Roxy and\nAmanda. The continued pressure allowed a pass to the\nunmarked Alice who belted\nthe ball into the corner of the\nnet. 1-1.\nThe game carried on with\nthe same high speed flare to\nhalf time with Sarah \u2018please\nput me on the subs bench\u2019\nCollins running around confusing their midfield and\nSarah \u2018everywhere\u2019 Conolly\nappearing all over the place.\nI have never seen someone\nrun around so much (and it\nwasn\u2019t even 10am!)\nUnfortunately the speed\nof the game in the first half\nhad taken its toll on the RSM\nteam whilst CSM replaced\nhalf their team with the five\nsubs they had brought with\nthem. We started the second half defending a short in\nwhich our centre back, Sara,\nwho had come to play despite\nan injury and had produced\nsome fine stops and clearances in the first half, got\ninjured.\nGemma, who was half frozen on the sidelines, came\non to replace Sara and the\ndefence had a reshuffle.\nCamborne took advantage\nand put away two quick goals\nas the RSM adjusted. Some\ngood defensive play by Gilly,\nGemma, Rachel and Suzie in\ngoalstoppedfurtherattempts.\nCamborne caught us on the\nbreak and also caught my\nfoot with the ball (then the\nstick \u2013 I later had to make a\ntrip to A&E), and managed to\nconvert the subsequent short\ncorner into a goal. A final\ngoal was disallowed despite\nCamborne\u2019s protests that the\numpire needed glasses.\nThe game ended 4-1 to CSM\nbut RSM played with determination and flare. The game\nsaw some excellent passing\nand play from the RSM team\nwith Sarah Connolly winning\nthe \u2018man of the match\u2019 award\nfor her presence absolutely\neverywhere on the pitch.\nA good time was had by all\nand we can\u2019t wait to turn the\nresult around at Camborne\nnext year.\nRSM Men 1\nCSM Men 3\nBy Peter Jackson\nEncouragedbythestrong(but\nslightly unlucky) performance from the RSM women\u2019s\nhockey players immediately\nprior to our game, the RSM\nmen took to the pitch intent\non hitting back at Camborne.\nHowever, for a long while\ninto the first half the two\nteams remained deadlocked,\nequalling each other in mid-field. The best early RSM\nchance came when Simon\nPike took a hit from a short\ncorner demanding a goal\nline clearance from the CSM\ndefenders.\nIt was the CSM team who\nscored first, about midway\nthrough the first half. After\nRSM failed to clear their lines\nthe CSM number nine produced a good (but not great)\nfinish from close on goal.\nRSM heads did not drop\nafter going behind; Mike\nPettit, Tom Diaper and Sam\nLloyd all continued to play\nvery well in midfield and it\nlooked like the score would\nstay 1-0 into half time. But\njust before half time came,\nthe CSM forwards reacted\nquickest to a ball rebounding\nback off our post and the RSM\nwere 2-0 down at the break.\nIt was clear that if RSM\nwere going to get back in the\ngame they were going to have\nto push men forward and so\nthey came out for the second\nhalf on the attack.\nThe change in mentality\npaid off when shortly into\nthe second period Martin\n(Stanners) Stanley produced\na very neat finish, silencing\nthe Camborne fans mid-song\nand pulling the RSM back\ninto the match.\nHowever, with more people\ncommitted forward, pushing\nfor the equaliser, the RSM\nback line became exposed\nand CSM stole another goal,\nfrom which RSM could not\nrecover.\nThe final score on the day\nwas 3-1. The best RSM performance was produced by\nour central defender Tony\nStocks. We would like to thank\neveryone who turned out to\nsupport us.\nRSM Men 5\nCSM Men 2\n\u201cWe can have this boys... do\nit, just imagine what it will\nbe like at the players dinner if we lose this game\u201d.\nFor some of the RSM football\nveterans, it wasn\u2019t a case of\nimagining, but remembering\nthe 2002 Bottle match where\nCamborne won 5-2.\nIt was now the responsibility of John Eudall to make\nsure the cup stayed in SW7\nfor a second successive glorious year.\nThere were six players\nwith Bottle match experi-ence. They knew what was\nrequired to win, they knew\nhow tough the game would be\nand soon reminded the debu-tants that this would be the\nhardest game of the year.\nThe game started brightly\nwith RSM playing a classic 4-4-2 formation and Camborne\nstarting with a Jose (stifle the\nlife out of football) Mourinho\nstyle 4-5-1.\nCamborne got the first goal\nagainst the run of play, but\nmaking life difficult for ourselves had become a recurring theme. Soon, however,\nwe were back on level terms\nwith a period of pressure\nresulting in an own goal.\nThe Camborne midfield\nwas starting to function like\na well oiled Cornish combine\nharvester and soon the extra\nman took it toll. RSM conceded two goals in a short\nspace of time and suddenly\nthe cup was slipping from our\ngrasp.\nHalf time came and so\ndid the inspiration. A free\nkick on the Camborne left\nwas whipped in and Carlos,\nwho was player of the season and flown specially back\nfrom Portugal for the game,\npowered a header past the\nCamborne keeper.\nFear crept into Camborne\nlike a thief in the night. RSM\nstarted to dominate and the\nwhole team from Rob in goal\nwith his confidence-exuding\npersona to Alex Hombre who\nwas holding the ball up well\nand feeding the other attacking players. From a corner,\nEwan headed from close\nrange and in a controversial\nincident the ball was adjudged\nto have crossed the line by\nthe referee. The Geoff Hurst\ngoal in 1966 looked more obvi-ous. We didn\u2019t care... we were\nlevel and playing exhibition\nfootball.\nFrom there, not even dodgy\nlinesmans calls could stop\nus. One through ball, which\nreached Alex, bounced perfectly for him to lob their tiny\n\u2018keeper from 25 yards. This\nlead to a mini pitch invasion\nfrom Ed Turner and Kirk\n(there will probably be a FA\ninvestigation).\nRSM were in the lead and\nthat wasn\u2019t going to change.\nThe crowd got louder,\nthe passing got better and\nCamborne looked dejected.\nOn the counter attack with\nCamborne desperately trying\nto get back in the game, Rich\nGibson curled a beauty from\ndistance to seal the win.\nAfter the sporting festivities,\nthe teams and supporters\nproceeded to Lorenzo\u2019s for\nan all-you-can-eat buffet.\nThe night ended with everyone happy, the Bottle safely\nback in the RSM (Union)\nBar for another year, and\ngenerally the gentlefolk of\nthe RSM looking forward to\nanother trip to Camborne\nnext year!\nThe 103rd Bottle match\nSQUASH\nHOCKEY\nHOCKEY\nFOOTBALL\nTHE AFTERMATH\nWEDNESDAY\n23 FEBRUARY\nBADMINTON\nBath Men\u2019s 1st 7\nImperial Men\u2019s 1st 1\nFENCING\nImperial Women\u2019s 1st 135\nWarwick Women\u2019s 1st 39\nImperial Men\u2019s 1st 115\nCambridge Men\u2019s 1st 128\nFOOTBALL\nImperial Men\u2019s 6th 1\nSSEES Men\u2019s 1st 0\nHOCKEY\nSt Bart\u2019s Men\u2019s 3rd 0\nImperial Men\u2019s 4th 2\nSt George\u2019s Women\u2019s 2nd 2\nImperial Women\u2019s 2nd 1\nSt George\u2019s Men\u2019s 1st 3\nICSM Men\u2019s 1st 2\nICSM Men\u2019s 2nd 4\nEssex Men\u2019s 2nd 1\nGKT Men\u2019s 3rd 1\nICSM Men\u2019s 3rd 2\nBrunel Women\u2019s 2nd 11\nICSM Women\u2019s 2nd 0\nRUGBY\nGlamorgan Men\u2019s 1st 27\nImperial Men\u2019s 1st 19\nUWIC Men\u2019s 2nd 73\nICSM Men\u2019s 2nd 5\nReading Men\u2019s 3rd 69\nICSM Men\u2019s 3rd 0\nSQUASH\nExeter Women\u2019s 1st 4\nImperial Women\u2019s 1st 1\nTENNIS\nSouthampton Women\u2019s 1st 2\nImperial Women\u2019s 1st 8\nSATURDAY\n26 FEBRUARY\nBADMINTON\nImperial Mixed 1st 3\nUCL Mixed 1st 6\nFOOTBALL\nImperial Men\u2019s 1st 3\nSt George\u2019s Men\u2019s 1st 1\nImperial Men\u2019s 6th 0\nHolloway Men\u2019s 6th 3\nSport\nresults\nSome people enjoyed the\nday a bit too much...\nRSM women\u2019s hockey: the\ngolden girls\n\n"

    "content": "Columns felix@ic.ac.uk\nMusic is a passion for many, and\nso I thought a nice little method for\ndescribing artists was required.\nThere is so much you can do with\nmusic, and yet most popular artists nowadays try to get away with\nas little as possible. Surely music\nhas to be interesting? Surely something should happen in the three\nor four minutes that you listen to a\nsong? Not if you are Damien Rice.\nHis name alone bores me, and seldom has someone had to change\nthe radio whilst driving so quickly in\norder to prevent them from falling\nasleep and crashing. So he gets the\nfabled \u2018worst, most dull artist ever\u2019\nposition in the continuum.\nAmbient music has more presence\nthan Mr Rice, despite less actual\nnoise. Obviously he\u2019s closely followed by such luminaries as David\nGray, Katie Melua and their friends.\nGradually you work up through the\ndross (Embrace, Doves etc) to the\naverage, interesting band, who can\nwrite a pop ditty and keep you all\nentertained. Plus there\u2019s the old\ncheese attraction. People like McFly\nmay be rubbish, but at least it\u2019s\ninteresting rubbish.\nThen you move on to people like\nLost Prophets, or Morrissey, where\nyour attention is grabbed and held.\nFinally the masters come into town,\nwith artists like The Mars Volta,\nAphex Twin, Thelonius Monk and\nJeff Buckley, who hold your attention even when long \u2018wig-outs\u2019 are\nin progress. This is purely because\nthey are a million times the artist bloody Damien Rice is. A chart\nexplains it all below:\nRubbish Damien Rice\nDull Doves\nOK McFly\nGood Lost Prophets\nI want your The Mars Volta\nchildren\nNow what is the point of all this?\nThe point is that it\u2019s a system that\nthe music companies are adopting to prevent people buying the\nwrong type of music. They don\u2019t\nwant 85-year-old grannies suddenly\nadmitted to A&E due to excessive\nexcitement caused by interesting\nmusic. That\u2019s the source of lawsuits,\nand seeing as they can barely afford\nto keep their children in million-dollar fur coats with all the piracy\nnowadays, it\u2019s a risk they can\u2019t afford\nto take.\nBut what does it take for a band\nto be interesting? Is it the same\nthing that makes them good live?\nIs it the music? Or is it the man\nstanding behind you with a gun to\nyour head? A mix of all the above\nsurely, like the Scissor Sisters\u2019 show\n\u2013 flamboyant, entertaining, cracking\nmusic and free gunman with every\nCD.\nBut then again, the interesting\nbands aren\u2019t for everyone, for they\nrequire concentration in order to\nappreciate the music; as opposed to\nRice who requires effort to prevent\nthe sound going into your ears and\ndestroying your soul.\nThe musical continuum\nby TRISTAN LANE\nBeing stuck a lab with polymerase\nchain reactions and electrophoresis to keep me busy has meant my\nromantic life has taken a turn for the\nworse. Long days, ten hours long,\nfrom nine in the morning to seven\nin the evening, mean the work-swamped Stormy is fighting very\nhard to ensure that a lack of play\ndoes not make her a dull girl! And a\nlack of play \u2013 with only the intranet\nand geeky married boffins with parents\u2019 evenings for conversational\nsparkle \u2013 means new opportunities\nhave to be sought out in the beacon of intellectual talent (sic) that\ncomprises the Medical Research\nCouncil.\nWith my previous experiences of\ngood-looking men being uninspiring,\ndue to their lack of personality (ie\nnot having one), I hope the boffins\nmay reveal some unearthed potential amongst their cerebral masses.\nAnd it is with this optimism that I\nbegin \u2018Hospital Watch\u2019, in the vein of\n\u2018Neighbourhood Watch\u2019, for fit doctors and researchers.\nBesides Hospital Watch, I\u2019ve not\nbeen up to much. The talent I\u2019ve\nstarted to attract is very distinctive\n\u2013 especially with regards to their\nappearance. I\u2019ve had a Jew and\nMuslim, skullcap and beard intact,\nenquire outright about my romantic\nstatus. I\u2019ve also been out to dinner\nwith a baptised Sikh, complete with\nsword, turban and bangle, alongside\na dreadlocked anarchist (yes, I can\u2019t\nresist them in their natural form\n\u2013 everybody has their fetish and\nlocked hair on white/Asian guys is\nmine) from Gwent\u2019s anarchist crew.\nThey were both very fascinating\nconversationalists, let me assure\nyou \u2013 with sketchy pseudo-badboy\npasts and an idealistic take on life.\nAlas, neither of them got further\nthan a friendly hug thanks to Stormy\ndeveloping feelings for another guy.\nYou\u2019re shocked? I am too. I\u2019ve\nnever had to deal with this before.\nMy libido is at an all time high, since\nI keep turning down offers left right\nand centre. I\u2019m not interested in\nmeaningless (albeit very fun) sex,\nor short term relationships with\nvery generous men (face it, how\nlong will a practising Muslim put\nup with a girl who drinks, smokes\nshisha and enjoys wearing skimpy\nclothes, not to mention having a sex\nlife outside marriage?). I actually\nlike being around him, telling jokes,\nswapping stories, sharing dreams.\nI\u2019m not afraid to be my irreverent\nself around him.\nSo what\u2019s the big deal? It\u2019s the\ndisclosure aspect of intimacy that\nfazes me. Actually letting him in on\nmy deeper feelings and quirks. What\nif he can\u2019t deal with the different\ngroups of friends I have to reflect\ndifferent parts of my personality?\nWhat if he\u2019s secretly resenting the\nfact I come from a different background compared to what he\u2019s used\nto \u2013 wishing me to be like everyone else. I have different snacks\nin my kitchen made out of unusual\ningredients, that I\u2019m used to eating my home-cooked food with my\nhand \u2013 the way it\u2019s done in my parents\u2019 land. It\u2019s almost understandable how a girl could become self-conscious in these \u2018disclosure\u2019 type\nsituations \u2013 and perhaps fall (out of\nfamiliarity-based convenience) for\nthe gangster Sikh who eats food the\nsame way, and keeps a similar snack\ncollection in his cupboard.\nThe mind boggles. True love overcomes these insecurities if both\npartners are adventurous and willing to accept the other with whatever baggage they may come with.\nOr so I\u2019d like to think; I wouldn\u2019t\nknow for sure having never been in\na functional relationship, let alone\nlove, during my brief but eventful\nstay on this Good Earth.\nSo there we go.

I am not a \u2018lefty\u2019 and\nam not the \u2018demonstrating\u2019 sort,\nyet I still think that his case and the\nwider civil liberties issues it raises\nare things we should be concerned\nabout.\nIf only to remind us of the climate\nwe now live in, the Government\nrushed its \u2018Prevention of Terrorism\u2019\nbill through Parliament this week.\nDespite a rebellion amongst Labour\nMPs, the second reading passed\nthrough the House by 14 votes.\nThe provisions will grant the Home\nSecretary powers to impose \u2018control\norders\u2019 on British citizens and others who are legitimately resident\nin the UK.\nWhat are these control orders?\nWell they include provisions for\nhouse arrest, curfews and smart\ntagging (where a chip is strapped\naround your wrist or ankle so law\nenforcement agencies can track\nyour movements). The Home\nSecretary will also be able to constrain other liberties, such as being\nable to ban you from using the telephone or internet.\nThe Home Secretary will be able\nto impose any of these control\norders upon any of us without reference to a proper judicial process.\nHe can do so if he believes there\nis enough \u2018intelligence\u2019 to believe\nthat you might commit a terrorist\nact. You do not have the right to\nknow what is alleged about you or\nthe ability to see, let alone chal-lenge, any evidence against you.\nCrucially, you are not presumed\ninnocent until proven guilty in a\ncourt of law.\nThis is the sort of assault on freedom that would make some \u2018rogue\nstates\u2019 proud. It\u2019s the very sort of\nthing we supposedly went to war in\nIraq to stamp out. The Government\nclaims it is doing all this to protect\nus from terrorism. Yet all it is really\ndoing is allowing terrorism to claim\nvictory by abandoning judicial process and attacking our freedoms.\nLondon has a proud and lengthy\ntradition of being a home from home\nfor political dissidents from across\nthe world. Political dissence is often\ngrounded in and around academia\nbecause of the liberating power of\neducation. Imperial College should\nrightly be a welcoming institution\nfor students and scholars from all\nbackgrounds, nationalities, beliefs\nand affiliations. Intellectual discourse and the free flow of ideas\nis essential in a civilised society.\nIt cannot and should not be constrained by political interference. In\nthe current political climate, more\nextensive security vetting of science and technology students, particularly those engaged in research,\nis almost certain to appear on the\nhorizion. We must to be ready to\noppose it.\nSecurity in halls\nThe College Security department\nhas approached us for help in getting opinion on the service they\nprovide to students. I believe they\ngenuinely want to improve and offer\nthe best service they can. They can\u2019t\ndo this without constructive feed-back, however. I should be grateful if anyone who wishes to make\ncomments would do so by emailing\npresident@ic.ac.uk with the subject\nline \u2018Security Feedback\u2019. Your comments will be treated in the strictest\nof confidence, if requested, and will\nhelp us to make things better.\nDo you feel safe in halls? Do you\nthink security guards are conscientious and sympathetic to your con-cerns? There is no good reason why\nyou shouldn\u2019t be able to answer yes\nto these questions and with some\nuseful feedback we can hopefully\nchange things to ensure you do.\nBickering\nGiven some of the important issues\nof the day, you could be forgiven for\nwondering why Union Councillors\n(and others) have been occupying\ntheir time considering a motion of no\nconfidence against me. It is rather\ndisappointing when normally sensi-ble, mature student representatives\nget into a room together and forget why they are there. Point scoring and pursuing personality-based\ngrievances can be fun for some of\nthose involved but isn\u2019t really very\nconstructive in the greater scheme\nof things.\nOne of the main protagonists\nprivately told me beforehand that\n\u201cthere are only 200 or so students\nwho really care about the Union and\nthey are the ones you should focus\non\u201d. Imperial College has 12,618\nstudents and now, with the matter\nclosed, we should get on with serving all of you.\nAs Henry Kissinger, former US\nSecretary of State, once said of his\ndays at Harvard, \u201cstudent politics\nis the most vicious kind there is\u2026\nprecisely because the stakes are so\nsmall and the fight so large.\u201d\nFreedom, politics and priorities\nSTATE OF\nTHE UNION\nMUSTAFA ARIF\nUNION PRESIDENT\nGet a job on the spot from one of the\nhundredsofAmericanCampDirectors\ncoming to our U.K. Recruitment Fairs\nto hire thousands of people to work\nat children\u2019s summer camps.\nLondon\nRecruitment Fair\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ncampamerica.co.uk\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\nI, science\nImperial\u2019s science magazine\nscience.felix@ic.ac.uk\nAVAILABLE\nIN ALL GOOD\nDEPARTMENTS AND\nCOMMON ROOMS\nFROM MONDAY\n14 MARCH\n\n"

Her mother, Flor\n(Paz Vega), decides to uproot\nthe family and move to America.\nDespite the move, Christina and\nFlor\u2019s social circles remain restricted to the small Spanish population in Los Angeles until Christina\nreaches puberty and Flor decides\nto work for a local American family,\nthe Claskys.\nThe Claskys are a wealthy family\nthat is far from perfect.

Deborah\u2019s mother is\nan alcoholic whose head remains\nlost in her not-too-glamorous past\nas a jazz singer.\nInitially, Flor has no intention of\nlearning English as she has no reason to intervene in the Claskys\u2019s\nlives. However, upon witnessing\nDeborah\u2019s tactlessness and insensitivity in handling Bernice\u2019s weight\nproblems, Flor decides to learn\nEnglish in order to help the Claskys.\nWhen summer comes, the Claskys\nask Flor to move with them to their\nsummer home. Flor is hesitant\nat first, as she will be required to\nbring Christina along, but she\nrelents in the interest of keeping\nher job.\nThis decision soon proves to be\na grievous mistake. Upon entering the Claskys\u2019 home, Deborah\ntakes Christina under her wing as\nChristina is the pretty and charming daughter that Bernice is not.\nChristina is gradually seduced into\nthe locals\u2019 way of life and drifts further away from Flor. Flor, distressed\nby the fact that she might lose her\nonly daughter, finds an understanding and sympathetic ear in John\nClasky.\nFlor is drawn to John, as she has\nnever met a man who could understand her. Similarly, John is drawn\nto Flor, who is everything his wife is\nnot. It seems Flor\u2019s problems with\nher daughter will remain under the\nwater until Christina dismisses a\nparty her mum organized to attend\na slumber party at the Claskys.\nEverything boils over and Flor and\nJohn finally attain the lucky break\nthey need for their mutual attraction\nto develop.\nSpanglish is not just a simple\nmother-daughter story. It is a movie\nthat explores the feelings of immigrants in a foreign land. It is also a\nmovie which challenges the individual to hold on to one\u2019s identity instead\nof assimilating with the crowd. One\nthing that I found particularly admirable about the plot is its ability\nto stay neutral without favouring\nany particular culture. Secondly, the\nmovie manages to avoid becoming a\nHallmark film by revolving around\nFlo and John who are emotionally\nstrong and do not give in to emotional theatrics.\nAdam Sandler and T\u00e9a Leoni\nmight be the household names on\nthe casting list, but it is truly Paz\nVega\u2019s acting skills that blow you\naway. Despite the introduction of\na sweet and believable chemistry\nbetween Flo and John, it has no\nreal impact on the story except to\nemphasize Flo\u2019s dedication to her\ndaughter. Paz Vega makes an excellent and convincing performance as\na beautiful and strong woman who\ndares to stand up for her own beliefs\ndespite her misfortune.\nOverall, Spanglish is a thoughtful\nmovie. Its unique ability to remain\nneutral and to avoid becoming a typical tear-jerker is admirable; how-ever, its predictable storyline and its\nunnecessary additions downplay its\ntrue potential. It\u2019s alright to watch\nit if you have some free time on\nyour hands, but if it was Spanglish\nhumour you were after, steer clear\nand don\u2019t say you have not been\nwarned.

Now there\u2019s a circular\nargument!\nThe film follows the adventures\nof Steve Zissou (Bill Murray), an\nexplorer and filmmaker desperately clinging onto remnants of fame\nand credibility. The film opens with\nZissou presenting his latest docu-mentary, in which his best friend\nis eaten by a tiger shark, to critics\nin Italy. During the post-film Q&A,\nZissou is asked the scientific relevance of his next film, the capture of\nthe offending shark. Zissou\u2019s deadpan reply: \u201crevenge.\u201d\nThe film explores Zissou\u2019s mid-life\nworries of inadequacies and waning\nsex appeal, but in a more appealing\nsetting than the standard male midlife crisis film.\nAlthough mostly comedic, there\nare some heart rendering moments,\nbut they pass so quickly into the biza-rely comic that you don\u2019t have time\nto appreciate their meaning. For\ninstance, Zissou\u2019s long estranged\nson, Ned (Owen Wilson), asks him:\n\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you contact me?\u201d Zissou\nreplies: \u201cBecause I hate fathers and\nI never wanted to be one.\u201d\nOther members of the motley\ncrew include defacto-son (Willem\nDafoe), who is displaced when Ned\nand a pregnant British journalist\n(Cate Blancett), whose cover story\nresents Zissou\u2019s last hope at mainta-ing credibility, appear. Once aboard\nThe Belfonte, they don red skull\ncaps and blue speedos and do battle\nwith sharks and filipino pirates.\nHow could anybody think up this\nstory? I hear you cry. Well, surprisingly enough it\u2019s based on the\nlife of oceanographer, JacquesYves Cousteau, who was perhaps\nthe ocean\u2019s David Attenborough.\nAlthough he too led a some what\neccentric life, one wonders if his\nrelatives will feel tarnished by this\nfilm.\nThe bizarre is what really makes\nthis movie. Highly coloured stop-motion animations of wacky marine\ncreatures, a navigations officer\ntopless for no discernible reason\nand David Bowie songs sung in\nPortuguese by the actor who played\nKnockout Ned in City of God are\njust a few examples of the film\u2019s\ncrazy happenings.

    "content": "www.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 3 March 2005 5\nIn the same month that\nNASA decided to abandon the\nHubble Space telescope and\na report found that the failed\nBeagle 2 mission was ill-prepared and under-funded,\nthe European Space Agency\n(ESA) has celebrated the dual\nsuccess of the safe arrival of\nthe Huygens probe on Titan\nand the launch of the Ariane 5\nsuper-rocket.\nThe latest version of the\nAriane 5 lifts payloads of up\nto 10 tonnes to geostationary orbit and has reinstated\nEurope\u2019s competitiveness\non the world satellite launch\nservices market. On 12\nFebruary, the rocket successfully sent a Spanish military\ntelecommunications satellite\nand a dummy payload into\norbit, just over two years after\nthe first attempt had ended\nin failure. Jean-Yves Le Gall,\npresident of the Arianespace\ncompany which develops and\nlaunches the Ariane rock-ets, had said before take-off:\n\u201cAriane 5 will be the workhorse of our company and the\nEuropean space industry for\nthe next 10 years.\u201d\nIn the wake of the Ariane\nlaunch, scientists have been\npartying hard at the ESA: last\nweekend the agency and the\nEuropean Commission organised a conference in Brussels\ninvolving over 40 nations and\n20 international organisations\nto discuss space exploration.\nEntitled \u2018Winning through\ncooperation: sharing the benefits of space\u2019, the conference\nwas aimed to enable dialogue\nbetween suppliers and industries that demand the space\ntechnology.\nAttending the conference,\nESA Director General JeanJacques Dordain said: \u201cThe\nsuccessful launch of Ariane\n5 brought us \u2018back to the\nfuture\u2019, boosting Europe\u2019s\nguaranteed access to space.\nAnd this outstanding achievement comes only a month\nafter the discovery of a new\nworld through the spectacular descent of ESA\u2019s science\nprobe Huygens onto Titan.\u201d\nThe ESA is an independent\nagency, not part of the EU.\nHowever, close ties are being\ndeveloped between the two\norganisations.Jointinitiatives\nsuch as the European global\nnavigation system Galileo,\nwhich is set to rival the US\u2019\nGlobal Position System (GPS)\nand towards which the EU\nare paying 1m euros, are\nindicative of the increasing\nrole of space exploration\nin European economic and\npolitical development. The\nEU\u2019s new constitution has\nalso significantly mentioned\n\u2018space\u2019 for the first time.\nVice President G\u00fcnter\nVerheugen,EUCommissioner\nfor Enterprise and Industry,\nsaid at the conference in\nBrussels: \u201cThe European\nUnion, the European Space\nAgency and the Member\nStates should optimise their\nrelations and respective\nresources. The Commission\nis currently working on a proposal for a genuine European\nSpace Policy. Reaching for\nthe stars brings very down\nto earth benefits to our citizens and industry, from radio\nnavigation, communication\nby satellite or early warning\nof natural disasters.\u201d\nVerheugen also said he\nwould propose a significant\nincrease in the Commission\u2019s\nresearch funding, which one\nofficial said was 235m euros\n($306.8m) over the period\n2003-2006. This is still miniscule in comparison with the\n$16.4 bn budget proposal set\nby George W Bush for NASA.\nscience.felix@ic.ac.uk\nBy Giovanna Larice\nBiochemistry department\nAs students we are all too\nfamiliar with the feeling of\noverwhelming boredom,\nfatigue, and drowsiness that\npuzzlingly accompanies most\nuniversity lectures, and the\nintense contagious yawning\nthat follows.\nAlthough common amongst\nmost of the animal kingdom\n(most mammals and some\nbirds and reptiles yawn), little is known about the reasons for yawning and for the\ngeneration of a contagious\nresponse (55 per cent of people will yawn within five minutes of seeing someone else\nyawn). Research into this\narea has been lacking.\nIt is widely accepted that\nyawning results in an internal physical response, as the\nsudden deep intake of oxygen increases the heart rate\n(heart rates can rise up to\n30 per cent during a yawn),\nhelping release the lungs and\nbloodstream of carbon dioxide and forcing more oxygen\ninto the brain. Yawning is\nthought to effectively ventilate the lungs, to heighten\nour alertness and to restore\nnormal breathing.\nBut yawning has been (and\nstill is) surrounded by a hazy\ncloud of mystery, with theories and speculation having\nbeen put forward as to what\ntriggers it and why it takes\nplace. Still scientists still don\u2019t\nunderstand all the biological\nmechanisms involved in this\nprocess.\nFa r- f e t c h e d - s o u n d i n g\nhypotheses have often been\nput forward. Are we to believe\none such theory, claiming\nyawning is merely a primitive\nremnant of our ancestors\u2019\nintimidatory tactics, where a\nyawn would bear our ever-so-frightening teeth?\nThe intensely inconsistent\nboredom theory (which is\nratherself-explanatory)might\nbe readily endorsed by those\nof us who suffer from a rather\nrestricted attention span but\ndoesn\u2019t explain, for example,\nwhy we yawn before competing in an important sporting\nevent or before delivering a\ncrucial presentation.\nAttempts to explain the\nreasons for yawning as a\nresult of low oxygen or high\ncarbon dioxide levels (which\nwe would experience during\nfatigue or sheer boredom,\nwhere breathing is shallow\nand little oxygen reaches the\nlungs) have proved rather\nunconvincing.\nConclusions from research\npublished in the journal\nEthology by Professor Robert\nProvine of the University of\nMarlyand in 1987, later confirmed in a 1997 paper in\nthe journal Psychonomic\nBulletin & Review by Dr\nRonald Baenninger of John\nHopkins University, showed\nthat people receiving additional oxygen didn\u2019t decrease\nyawning and people exposed\nto a lower amount of carbon\ndioxide didn\u2019t stop yawning.\nRecent work by Dr Martin\nSchurmann published in\nthe journal NeuroImage,\nhowever, has furthered our\nunderstanding of the contagious nature of the yawning\nprocess. Scientists found that\nthe true nature of contagious\nyawns was as an automatically released behavioural\naction, rather than a truly\nimitated motor pattern, as\nwas hitherto widely believed.\nHence, contagious yawning\nwas proven not to be simply\nan imitation act.\nThis data was obtained\nby MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scanning of\nthe brains of 30 volunteers\nexposed to videos of recorded\nyawns, and suggests a communicative function of yawns\nwhereby these constitute\nsocial clues that synchronise\ngroup behaviour.\nDr Schurmann writes in his\npaper: \u201cGroup synchronisation could be essential for\nspecies survival and works\nwithout action understanding,\nlike when a flock of birds rises\nin the air as soon as the first\nbird does so \u2013 supposably as\nit notices a predator.\u201d\nThe purpose of group syn-chronised yawning, how-ever, was not suggested and\nremains unknown.\nIt\u2019s peculiar how a reflex so\nordinary, a reflex so outwardly straightforward, harmless and natural, could be so\npoorly understood, yet lack\nof research in this area isn\u2019t\nso surprising, as other more\npressing matters must dominate the forefront of most scientists\u2019 minds.\nAs yawning is trouble-free\nfor most of us, studies into the\nphenomenon will continue to\nbe rare and our inability to\nfully comprehend it will inevitably remain lacking for some\ntime. Even reading about\nyawning can make you yawn;\nchances are you already have,\nby now.\nYawning: a mysterious, contagious, copycat reflex\nAriane 5 ECA Flight 164 takes off on 12 February 2005\nScience science.felix@ic.ac.uk\nEurope sets its sights on space\nThe success of the Huygens probe and Ariane 5 rocket have boosted Europe\u2019s reputation in space\nexploration.

That is to\nsay, I\u2019ve had feedback from\nabout seven people \u2013 three\nwere positive, three negative\n(there\u2019s no pleasing some\npeople) and one person commented that when their toilet paper ran out, my article\nmade a comfortable substi-tute, so I\u2019m counting that as a\npositive. If anyone disagrees\nwith this conclusion, feel free\nto email, but bear in mind\nthis week\u2019s topic is specifically endorsed by the man with\nthe wobbliest voice in popular\nmusic \u2013 David Bowie.\nI highly recommend you\ngo to your local Blockbuster,\nfind the section with the 1980s\nfilms and look up Labyrinth.\nThis is the film where David\nBowie impressed everyone\nwith two skills: the ability to\nspin crystal balls in a hypnotic display of light and col-our, and the ability to convincingly interact with a blob of\nlatex that has Jim Henson\u2019s\nhand up its arse. I\u2019m afraid\nI\u2019ll have to dash people\u2019s\ndreams right here \u2013 David\nBowie can\u2019t contact juggle at\nall, and had a chap with his\nhands through the costume\ndoing it all for him. The good\nnews is, you too can look just\nlike he did. Now if you can\nonly imitate the spiky hairdo,\nyou\u2019ll be more David Bowie\nthan David Bowie.\nOK, first thing\u2019s first.\nContact juggling is about\nmoving a ball around your\nbody so that it remains in\ncontact (nearly) all the time.\nIf you throw it, that\u2019s normal\njuggling, and just being able\nto juggle one ball isn\u2019t that\nimpressive. To contact jug-gle, start off with a ball in\nthe palm of your right hand,\nas Steve demonstrates [see\npicture 1].\nNow throw the ball and\nrotate your arm so that the\nball lands on the back of your\nhand [see pictures 2 and 3].\nEach time toss the ball a little closer to your hand so\nthat eventually it just rolls up\nover your fingers and keeps\nin contact with your hand at\nall times.\nNote the position of the fingers \u2013 they cradle the ball\nso that it doesn\u2019t fall off [see\npicture 4].\nNow you just have to roll\nit across to the back of your\nleft hand, and perform the\nsame motion again, and you\u2019ll\nhave it in your left palm [see\npictures 5 and 6]. Seems so\nsimple doesn\u2019t it? Once it\u2019s\nin your left palm, you can\nrepeat the entire process and\nend up with the ball in the\nright palm. If you\u2019re bored by\nnow (heaven forbid) then you\ncan try www.contactjuggling.\norg for more ideas and nice\npretty videos.\nAh, it all looks so easy. If you\nfancy coming along to juggling\non a Tuesday from 6pm in\nthe Union, email juggling@ic.\nac.uk and leave a message\nafter the beep. If you have\nsomething you can do that\nI can\u2019t, then also please let\nme know as I\u2019m always on\nthe lookout for new things to\nplay with.\nJUGGLING CLUB\nTen things I can do that you can\u2019t\nEPISODE SIX: Contact juggling\nKeep the ball in contact with your body at all times. Looks easy, doesn\u2019t it...\n1 2\n3 4\n5 6\nBy Claire Doyle\nEvery year in the spring term,\nthe ICU Choir spends a weekend away from college for two\ndays of intensive rehearsals\nand socialising, and this year\nour chosen destination was\nImperial\u2019s Wye campus.\nSaturday morning kicked\noff with an early start, meeting at 7.45am in a bitterly\ncold Beit Quad. The choir\u2019s\nenthusiasm didn\u2019t falter, how-ever, and once all our sleeping bags had been bundled\ninto the coach, we were on\nour way (much to the relief of\nthe 2012 Olympic committee,\nwho were assembling in the\nQuad at the same time!)\nBreakfast was served\non arrival and everything\nseemed to be running\nsmoothly until we discovered we\u2019d forgotten Therees\u2019\nmusic stand! Thankfully our\nvery own Deputy President\n(Education and Welfare)\nand former Choir chair, Sam\nRorke, came to our rescue\nlater in the afternoon (we\nknew the sabbaticals would\nbe useful one day!)\nBy 5.30pm and three\nrehearsals later we were\nready to kick back and relax,\nand that\u2019s when the fun really\nstarted! Thanks to our official Wye guide Nichola, we\nwere able to enjoy our pick\nof evening meals, whether\nit was traditional \u2018pub grub,\u2019\nIndian or Chinese that took\nyour fancy. We then ended\nthe day by regrouping at the\nWye union for a pub quiz and\nkaraoke session. The committee had spent many long\nhours carefully preparing\nthe quiz on the coach jour-ney, during lunch and even\nthe afternoon break! Topics\nvaried from \u2018How well do you\nknow the choir and committee\u2019 to \u2018Science and Imperial\u2019\nto \u2018Name that ringtone\u2019. We\neven managed to include a\npolling round and discovered\nthat the choir is more partial to triangular sandwiches\nthan square!\nThe karaoke was started by\none of our very brave basses\nAlex Field, who sang Enrique\nInglesias\u2019 Hero. As the rest\nof the teams seemed reluctant to follow his lead, it was\ndecided to give bonus quiz\npoints to any participants that\ntook to the stage. One team,\nwho called themselves \u2018This\nis a pencil\u2019, really got into the\nspirit of things and I think few\nof us will forget their renditions of The Tide Is High and\nGirls Just Wanna Have Fun.\nThey even went on to win the\nquiz... perhaps due to the vast\nnumber of bonus points they\nmanaged to obtain!\nOther highlights included\nchairs past, present and\nfuture, (Sam, Stef and Kate)\nsinging It\u2019s Raining Men, the\npresent and future committee\u2019s version of the karaoke\nclassic I Will Survive (some-one had to do it) and tickets\nofficer Mark serenading us\nwith I Believe I Can Fly by R\nKelly. A special mention must\nalso be given to an enthusiastic group of Wye students\nand our very own Elvis imper-sonator. The evening then\nended with 40-odd people\nsinging as loudly as they possibly could to Angels before\nwe retired to the JCR with\nour sleeping bags.\nOn Sunday morning\nTherees was greeted by a\nslightly less energetic choir,\nbut after some tea and coffee\nwe were ready for another\nthree rehearsals. By the end\nof the day, we had all had our\nfill of biscuits and were satisfied with a great weekend of\nsinging... if not feeling a little\nbit hoarse (especially our four\ntenors who, despite severely\nlacking in numbers, gave it\ntheir all!)\nSo if you want to see just\nwhat we managed to achieve\nover a weekend, come and\nsee us perform Brahms\u2019s\nGerman Requiem on\nThursday 10 March in the\nGreat Hall. If last weekend\nwas anything to go by, it\u2019s not\nto be missed!\nCHOIR\nWhy we went to Wye\nChoir quiz winners \u2018This is\na pencil\u2019\n12 www.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 3 March 2005\n\n"

    "content": "LIVE REVIEW\nThere are many reasons why we\nchoose the shows we do. First, it\nhelps to be a fan of the music. In\nthe case of The Kills that\u2019s easy. VV\n(aka Alison Mosshart) and Hotel\n(aka Jamie Hince) with their per-verse, raw, hard guitar rock are,\nquite simply, one heck of a duo. A\nsecond reason is that it can make\nsomeone (such as a sweetheart)\nreally jealous. Because when that\nsomeone likes a band and just can\u2019t\nmake the gig, well, the promise of\nteasing them afterwards brings a\nsense of added deliciousness to any\nevening. So when a calling card for\na night with The Kills unexpectedly came my way, I was on my bike\nbound for Camden Town quicker\nthan you could say \u201ca venue full of\nguys and gals with heavy rock\u2018n\u2019roll\nfringes and eighties boots\u201d.\nFrom the opening songs there\nwas a sense that The Kills were\nthere to show off their immense tal-ent. Guitar, vocals and a backstage\ndrum machine created an onslaught\nof sound. Willowy VV oozed rock\nchic coolness in jeans, an oversized\nT-shirt and military style jacket. The\nwide-eyed and gangly Londoner,\nHotel, lent the event a sense of\npurpose in his collared black shirt.\nVV\u2019s dark, waist-length, straight-as-death hair engulfed the microphone\nwhile her body tossed and tumbled\nwith each of Hotel\u2019s rifts. She was\nlike a puppet on crazed musical\nstrings. She paced the stage in little\ncircles before each song, psyching\nherself up to wow the audience with\nher dark, sexy drawl.\nMostly the songs were taken from\nthe debut album Keep On Your\nMean Side, although their new sin-gle, The Good Ones, was bound to\nhave been in there somewhere (if\nonly I recognised it).\nThe first set was short. The highlight was the last song, Kissy Kissy,\na slower, almost Paris Texas-like\nsounding number where VV also\nadopted a guitar. It had a strong\nelement of \u2018being in the bedroom\u2019\nabout it as they drew close and\nlocked their instruments in sensual conversation (even the drum\nmachine\u2019s heart skipped a beat).\nTheir second set began with Wait,\nVV\u2019s voice resplendent as the sad\nlyrics wafted over the audience:\n\u201cTell me what you done t\u2019 yourself\n/ I would like to know / Write it on\nthe rocks and then tell me where\nto go / Why you say wait?\u201d The\nheavier Fuck The People and Fried\nMy Little Brains were also audience favourites.\nCertainly the Kills kept up their\nair of mystery throughout, VV only\nonce speaking to us to welcome\nin the Chinese New Year before\nlaunching into Black Rooster (the\n\u2018in the basement\u2019 song for those\nunfamiliar with intricacies). It is the\nyear of the rooster. A nice touch,\nVV.\nThe venue also suited the mood.\nThe velvet wallpaper and the cool\nblack and white terrazzo tiles of\nthe upstairs Electric matched them\nperfectly. The set ended with The\nKills writhing on the floor and then,\nafflicted with a sudden attack of\nWednesdayitis, there was a mass\nand unacceptable exodus. Stop!\nMore foot stamping required please!\nBut it was not to be.\nI guess comparison with the\nWhite Stripes is inevitable. Indeed,\nthey are of the same genre: girl-boy\nand bass-free. I suppose someone\nhad to come first. But like all good\nWesterns, The Kills have their own\nlittle twists. For a start, they are\ncertainly less colour-sensitive than\nJack and Meg, but they are also\nbluesier and a bit more primal.\nAnd I was the first of us to see\nthem play live. But that\u2019s just rubbing it in. Zo\u00eb Corbyn\nLIVE REVIEW\nMath-rock! The genre (with its\nsilly name) is often associated with\nimpenetrably complex time signa-tures, stop-start rhythms and splitting headaches as a result of both.\nHowever, the migraine is only a\nresult of the fact that your meagre\nbrain cannot fully comprehend the\nwonder of music that refuses to be\npredictable, derivative and, worst of\nall, nice. Anyone who finds the new\nKaiser Chiefs album or Kasabian\nsong structures perplexing, be\nready to evacuate your bowels. This\nis not another Killers gig; This is\nsomething special: a line-up that\u2019s\ndiverse yet makes amazing, coherent sense.\nRedjetson (DrownedinSound\u2019s\nnew darlings) make very pretty\nmusic. They infuse Manchester melancholia (think Joy Division, Closer)\nwith F#A#(Infinity)-era Godspeed\nYou Black Emperor apocalyptic gui-tars. This may seem remarkably\nsnobbish and indie, but you cannot doubt how powerful said bands\u2019\nmusic can be.\nAs perfect this combination\nof styles may be, something still\ndoesn\u2019t feel right. The swooning\nvocals occasionally overshadow the\nprettiness of the music, and the illusion of being in a more glorious\nplace than Bloomsbury is shattered.\nHowever, they set the scene perfectly for YMSS.\nAfter being sedated by Redjetson,\nYMSS take the stage and launch into\nA little late he staggered through\nthe doors and into her eyes (who\nsaid post-rock titles were dead?).\nIt is difficult to resist sporadic,\nawkward motion when being soni-cally assaulted by these twitching\nrhythms. Yes, I am getting into the\nswing of all things post-rock by using\na thesaurus. While this song is flat\non record, it becomes pure anthem\nto those disaffected by conventional\nmusic live, so much so that during\nan a cappella moment the audience\ntakes over whilst the band take a\nbreather.\nIf Works makes you wonder how\nanyone ever got away with the quiet\nverse, loud chorus agenda for more\nthan a decade without ever wanting\nto expand on such a tired, raped of\nlife structure. Finally, as if I haven\u2019t\nbeen sycophantic enough, they finish with \u2026Spooks The Horse and\nexpress what for most bands is a\nlife\u2019s worth of ambition in eight and\na half minutes. This made my heart\nwant to burst out of my ribcage and\nmy head implode leaving a horrible\nmess for the already dismal ULU\nstudent staff to clear up. I restrained\nmyself.\nNext to pick up the pieces of my\nalready decimated senses and mutilate them some more were the ever\nwonderful 65*daysofstatic. Anyone\nwho denies the power of Retreat!\nRetreat! really needs to remove the\npen that you stuck up your nose for\na laugh when you were 16 and get\nyour earwax removed. As soon as\nthe soundbite, \u201cYou will not retreat,\nthis band is unstoppable!\u201d appears,\nyou try to hold your breath waiting for the inevitable ear-crushing\nbliss, but you can\u2019t help but lose\ncontrol.\nBy the way, I apologise to the\nUniversity of London Union staff\nfor my \u2018mishaps\u2019. I can\u2019t promise it won\u2019t happen again, but\nI will wear continence pads. The\nbrilliance of 65*daysofstatic is the\nfact that they combine electronic\nbeats and samples with live instrumentation flawlessly. You have to\ngive up working out who is playing what and justdo what the band\nwant you to do: focus on the music.\nWhen certain bands want you to\nfocus on the music to detract from\ntheir blatant ugliness, 65*daysof-static just know that with music\nthis demanding there is no time for\nimage. Something exciting is hap-pening. This gig is testament to that,\nmigraine or no migraine.\nMatthew Hoban\nThis is not punk rock\nYouthmovie Soundtrack Strategies, Redjetson, and the truly superb 65*daysofstatic - the\nthree most innovative, experimental and inspirational bands in London\nThe Kills: they\u2019re \u201cjust friends\u201d, kids\nwww.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 3 March 2005\n14\nMusic music.felix@ic.ac.uk\n65*daysofstatic: why do these guys still have day jobs?\nScuzzy blues from a boy-girl duo who aren\u2019t striped\nThe Kills\nThe Camden Barfly\nHHHHI\n65*daysofstatic / YMSS /\nRedjetson\nUniversity of London Union\nHHHHH\n\n"

The\nfirm dethroned the record\u2019s\nprevious owner, Shell, who\nspent only weeks at the top\nspot.\nHSBC\u2019s profit increase \u2013 up\n37% from 2003 \u2013 comes at the\nend of a month in which many\nUK banks reported increased\nearnings. The Royal Bank of\nScotland, the UK\u2019s second\nlargest bank, made 14% more\nmoney in 2004 than in 2003,\nand Barclays announced a\n20% increase in earnings for\nthe same year.\nThe profit of \u00a39.6bn works\nout at around \u00a31m an hour.\nChairman Sir John Bond said\n2004 was \u201canother good year\nfor HSBC\u201d.\nRip-off Britain?\nBut not everyone is happy\nabout this increase in profit.\nSome argue that the recent\nprosperity of UK banks marks\na return to \u201crip-off Britain,\u201d\nand that banks are benefitting from excessive prices\nand mark-ups on interest\nrates.\nBut while banks do profit\nfrom interest collected on\nloans, the recent earning\nincrease can not be solely\nattributed to heightened\ninterest rates.\nBanks profit by loaning\nmoney. They borrow it from\nthe general public, by getting people to put their money\nin bank accounts. They then\ntake this money and lend it to\npeople who need it, charge a\nhigher interest rate and pocket the difference. If they are\nmaking more money, it must\nmean that they are charging more interest, and creating a bigger gap between the\namount they give to savers\nand the amount they charge\nborrowers.\nWe are currently living in a\nperiod of low interest rates,\nwhich increases the number\nof people who are able to\nborrow money. Last July,\nthe amount owed on loans,\nmortgages and credit cards\nreached \u00a31 trillion. Banks, in\nturn, profit from this increase\nin customers.\nA large percentage of\nHSBC\u2019s profit is also generated overseas. Only 24% of the\nHSBC\u2019s earnings last year\ncame from the UK and a significant amount of revenue\ncame from Household, the US\nconsumer lending firm HSBC\nacquired in 2003.\nHSBC Chairman Sir Bond\ndefended the profits: \u201cWe are\nin 77 countries and our UK\nprofits are no different from\nprofits in other markets.\u201d\nThe British Banker\u2019s\nAssociation said UK customers are \u201cgetting a good deal,\u201d\nand that banks are profiting\nbecause of their size, not\nbecause of increased fees.\n\u201cThe return they get on the\ncapital needed to keep going\nis 1%, which is not a huge\nreturn,\u201d a spokesperson said.\nConsumers have, howev-er, been complaining about\nexcessive charges, such\nas late payment fees. Late\npayment fees are supposed\nto cover the cost of writing\ncustomers letters, but many\nsee them as a cynical way of\nboosting profits.\nCredit card interest charges are also very high, and\ncan often be many times the\nBank of England interest\nrate. Some have complained\nthat the excessive rates are a\nway of targeting the poor who\ndo not have a high enough\ncredit rating to borrow at the\nstandard rate.\nDon Cruickshank, who\nheaded a Treasury backed\nreview of the banking indus-try, said that many of the\nproblems consumers have\nwith the banking industry are\nthe same as they were five\nyears ago. Mr Cruickshank\ncited improved customer\nservices and faster cheque\nclearing as changes he would\nlike to see made.\nStaff to strike?\nThe extra profit has not\nfound its way to the majority of the company\u2019s staff,\nmany of whom will not get\na pay rise.\nAmicus, the trade union,\nis balloting its members to\ndecide on strike action by\nHSBC workers. They argue\nthat the increase in out-sourcing, including the latest\nannouncement by HSBC that\nthey will be moving 2000 jobs\nto India, makes a mockery\nof the \u2018World\u2019s Local Bank\u2019\nmotto that the company\nadopts.\nHSBC Towers: Did the size and magnificence of these buildings contribute to HSBC\u2019s spectacular success?\n\u201cConsumers have\nbeen complaining\nabout excessive\ncharges, such as\nlate payment fees\u201d\n\u201cThe profit of\n\u00a39.6bn works out\nat around \u00a31m\nan hour\u201d\n\n"

With even its\nproposer voting against it,\nthe motion now stood little\nchance of being passed by the\nrequired two thirds majority.\nAfter almost three hours of\ndeliberation, the President\nremained in post when only\neight members voted in\nfavour of dismissing him.\n\u25cf State of the Union,\npage 6\nUnion protests as former student\nfaces extradition hearing\nBy Dave Edwards\nLawyers will attempt to extradite a former Imperial College\nstudent and staff member\nunder new terrorism legislation at a court hearing today.\nBabar Ahmad\u2019s case is the\nfirst to be heard under the\nExtradition Act 2003, which\nallows British citizens to be\nextradited to the US without\nthe need for any evidence\nto be provided and without\nthe accused being given any\nchance to respond to the alle-gations.\nMr Ahmad stands accused\nof running websites for foreign terrorist organisations\nand providing information\nabout potential new recruits.\nA delegation from\nImperial College Union were\npresent outside Bow Street\nMagistrates Court yesterday for the first part of the\ntwo-day hearing.

Roulette is gambling,\nblackjack is gambling, but the\nbest poker players act on reason and instinct developed\nthrough experience \u2013 they\nnever purely gamble.\nTo play poker, you need\nskill, insight and natural abil-ity. You have to know how\nto make decisions, improvise\nand adapt to the environ-ment.

As our\nSofa says, \u201cthe convention\nwent smoothly [considering\nour first didn\u2019t interviewer\narrive on time]. I think everyone had a good time and\nwe managed to raise a fair\namount for charity\u201d. Picocon\nwas visited by more than 120\npeople nationwide, including some from Scotland and\nNorthern Ireland.\nPicocon opened its doors\nat 10am, as promised, thanks\nto the effort of the Illuminati,\nwho got there at 8am to set\nup. As attendants were arriv-ing, they got sorted into teams\n(the above mentioned). Only\none team could win by the\nend of the day, and its members could earn points by\nbringing \u2018things\u2019 to the front\ndesk. These \u2018things\u2019 included\neverything from former ICSF\nChairs or published authors\nto origami pieces and tickets\nfrom Mornington Crescent.\nThe bonus token was bringing Excalibur, for which the\nKingdom \u201con\u201d England was\nawarded. Team Rocket was\nthe winner of the day, by a fair\namount of points (too many\nex-Chairs ended up in this\nteam).\nOne of the best moments\nof the day was, undoubtedly,\nthe Destruction of Dodgy\nMerchandise (DoDM). The\nauction was lead by one of\nthe ICSF ex-chairs, and the\ntools provided were a ham-mer, a rubber bonker, bolt\ncutters and lots and lots of\nliquid nitrogen. The highlights of the auction were\nthe Spirit of Obi Wan, the\nLoTR Goblet of Greed, Windup Legolas and, last but not\nleast, William Shatner\u2019s video\nMysteries of the Gods which,\nalone, went for \u00a345. Sadly, it\nwas not destroyed. It is now\nin David Weir\u2019s possession.\nIf anybody sees it, you are\nallowed to retrieve it by any\nmeans and bring it back to\nthe ICSF library, where it will\nbe disposed of properly. The\ntotal raised by the DoDM was\nover \u00a3165, with all proceeds\ngoing to RAG.\nThe central events of the\nday were the authors\u2019 talks,\nrunning from the morning all\nthe way through the after-noon. Two of our authors had\ntopics to their talks: Gwyneth\nJones on Insanity, and Brian\nStableford on the Myth of\nthe Space Age, while Jon\nCourtenay Grimwood had a\nQ&A session about his books.\nFinally, the three of them took\npart in a panel discussion,\nwhere they discussed different aspects of science fiction.\nBoth the talks and the panel\ndiscussion were a success,\nthe attendance being very\nhigh.\nAfterwards, to balance serious discussion with inanity,\nthe Ministry of Silly Games\ntook place, run by Dave\nClements. Members from\neach of the teams took part,\nin a desperate attempt to win\nthe last points and snatch\nvictory off Team Rocket\u2019s\nhands (which, of course,\ndidn\u2019t happen). The fact that\nDave, awarding the points,\nbelonged to Team Rocket\nhas nothing to do with this...\nThe players lived up to everybody\u2019s expectations, excelling at Mornington Crescent,\nCharades and Just a Minute.\nWhile all these events were\nhappening around the Union\nbuilding, dB\u2019s was a continuous event of games and books\nfrom opening to closing time.\nWe had two book stalls from\ntwo of our favourite book-sellers, Fantasy Centre and\nPorcupine Books. They are\nsome of our stronger sup-porters, having come to many\nPicocons! Several games\nwere running throughout\nthe day, including a non-stop\nmultiplayer UT2004 and oth-ers, such as Munchkin, Magic\nand Pirates of the Spanish\nMain.\nHowever, at 5.30pm, something out of the ordinary hap-pened. Two men, representing the noble universities of\nCambrigde and Imperial, met\nin the Quad to defend the\nhonour of their societies by\nmeans of the ancient tradition of fish duelling. Dressed\nin black and protected by\nchain mail, both men fought,\nwith two fish each, to the\ndeath or to the best of seven\nblows. Oxford brought shame\nupon themselves by failing to\npresent a champion. Sadly,\nthe Imperial champion lost to\nCambridge, but lost with hon-our, and managed to get fish\nguts on his opponent\u2019s face.\nEven so, the Fish Duel Trophy\nwill be sent to Cambridge,\nuntil we can retrieve it next\nyear.\nTo round off the day, Picocon\nended with the Grand Quiz.\nTen brave teams faced a furious barrage of questions in\nten rounds, with a variety of\nresults. Special mention goes\nto the Wye team that, well,\ntried. Surprisingly enough,\nthe winners of the quiz\nwere the team \u2018Authors and\nMooks\u2019, formed by our guests\nof honour (because some of\nthe questions were not about\ntheir books, of course not)\nand their \u2018babysitters\u2019.\nSomething new this year\nwas the constant presence of\na filming team, putting together a documentary on fan-run\nconventions, both from the\npoint of view of the organisers\nand the attendants. Coming\nsoon to a theatre near you.\nAlmost.\nWe hope that everybody\nwho attended Picocon had\na great time. See you there\nnext year!\nThe Imperial College Union\nScience Fiction library can be\nfound in the West Basement\n(Beit Quad) and is open\nbetween 12 and 2pm on week-days.\nPOKER SOCIETY\nPicocon: a day of randomness and fun\nSCIENCE FICTION,\nFANTASY AND HORROR\nSOCIETY\nThe Ministry of Silly Games in session\n\n"

    "content": "www.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 3 March 2005\n16\nNightlife clubs.felix@ic.ac.uk\nFRIDAY\nHaving been to Turnmills on numerous occasions (and having actually\nstarted working there) I can honestly say I have never seen the club\nget completely rammed so quickly\n\u2013 the place was full by 11.30pm.\nNot being a trance boy, I\u2019m not too\nknowledgeable on which DJs are\nreally famous, so I couldn\u2019t understand why it had reached capacity,\nbut when midnight came they had to\nstop letting people into the club.\nMy ignorance soon ended when a\nscary midget Dutch pillhead cyber\ninformed me that she had come\nfrom Holland just for this night as\nthe line-up was so good. Apparently,\nto see Ferry Corsten or AVB on their\nown is a big deal, but to see them\ntogether is something that could not\nbe missed.\nTrance not being my favourite\ntype of music I didn\u2019t quite know\nwhat to expect. This was good as I\nwas blown away. The atmosphere\nwas amazing \u2013 people were properly having it before midnight. The\nmixing was impeccable from the\nheadliners.\nThe main complaint I heard all\nnight though was about the treatment people had received from the\nstaff. I\u2019m surprised people still go\nback time after time to Turnmills, as\nthe door staff are some of the rudest people I\u2019ve ever met. They were\nabusive and control freaks, and this\nsort of behaviour is enough to spoil\nyour entire night. I spoke to one\ngirl who got manhandled because\nshe questioned paying \u00a315 when the\nflyer said that with your student\ncard you only had to pay \u00a312. This\nseems to be a continuing problem\nwith a lot of the big clubs in London\n\u2013 they have the opinion that they can\ntreat their customers like dirt and\nthat it\u2019s OK.\nHaving said in the past that most\nhard house/hard trance nights are\nfull of towny pillheads, I will take\nthat all back. There was a huge\nmix; there were people from all over\nthe world. Some of the clubbers\nhad planned holidays from America\naround this night. This mix is always\ngood because people with tans are\ngenerally far more attractive than\nthe pasty Brit.\nDrinking in clubs is always\nexpensive, but this is something\nyou just have to accept. The prices at Turnmills are not the worst.\nHowever, it is not acceptable to be\nmade to pay \u00a33 for a bottle of water\nwhich is the size of a can of coke.\nThis wouldn\u2019t be so bad if you could\ncome and go from the club as you\nplease, but then I suppose the club\nwouldn\u2019t make as much money and\nwouldn\u2019t be able to bring in the big\nnames.\nAll in all, the night was a huge suc-cess. The club stayed open an extra\nhour because the people just wanted\nto party. The only down side was\nthe attitude of the door staff, which\nI think is a huge problem because\nif people are harassed when they\narrive at a club they are more likely\nto get into trouble while there.\nSATURDAY\nWe all know who Eric Prydz is, and if\nwe don\u2019t we certainly know his video.\nYou know, the aerobics one with the\ngirls in small lycras. OK, perhaps\nsome of the girls aren\u2019t too familiar\nwith it, but all the guys are.\nSo, from a DJ set, you would expect\na mix of crappy chart dance. Well\nyou would be wrong, just like I was.\nYou couldn\u2019t be further from what\nactually happened \u2013 it was a mix of\ndeep house with a bit of electro, and\nthe back room was pure funk.\nThankfully the club was nowhere\nnear as rammed as on the Friday\nfor The Gallery; you could actually\nmake your way through the dance-floor.\nThe crowd was an eclectic mix.\nYou had your beautiful fashion kids\nand a few beer boys who expected poppy tripe. There seemed to\nbe quite a few older people there\nas well. This I always find a bit\nstrange. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s because\nI\u2019m incredibly ageist, but there is\nsomething very odd about a 45-year\nold gran dropping, it doesn\u2019t seem\nquite right. The guy to girl ratio was\nvery good, about half and half.\nThe staff, this time, seemed to\nhave sorted out all of the issues they\nhad the night before and were surprisingly cheerful. This may have\nbeen due to the lack of a neverending queue or because the weather wasn\u2019t so cold. The stewards\nstrangely also seemed to know what\nwas going on.\nThe best thing about this night\nwas that if you so wished and you\nwere feeling incredibly hardcore\nyou could carry on clubbing until\n2pm the next day, as Trade started\nin the back room at 5.30am.\nI would recommend this night if\nyou like it deep \u2013 musically speak-ing. If you like it that little bit funkier,\nthe back room had plenty to offer.\nIt was tune after tune after tune, a\ntrue delight for the ears.\nSUNDAY\nThis was my first visit to The Cross\nand I have to say the only word to\ndescribe everything is \u2018random\u2019.\nIt is in the most random place\never, buried behind King\u2019s Cross\nstation in the industrial area under\na bridge. The club has palm trees\nand sofas outside. Even though it\nwas a mission to get to, it was well\nworth it.\nVertigo is a night of Italian polysex-ualism, which basically means if\nyou\u2019re gay, straight, bi or just a bit\nof a whore, this is the night for you.\nIt was attitude-free with some of\nthe most beautiful people I have\nseen in a long while; fair enough\nthey can\u2019t all speak English, but that\ndoesn\u2019t matter as they then can\u2019t\nunderstand how much of a retard\nyou are when you\u2019re chatting them\nup. As it is a Sunday night, most of\nthe crowd had been at it all weekend and some probably hadn\u2019t slept\nor changed their clothes. Nobody\nnoticed of course, as the majority\nof the people were so mashed they\ncould barely see.\nSomething that was very funny\nwas the number of people wearing\nsunglasses. Not just a few, like you\nsee in most clubs, but almost everyone had a pair. It was like a branch\nof Specsavers had been built next\ndoor and they had a sale of tinted\nlenses. Also I think if you added up\nhow much the clientele had spent\non fake tan, you would be able to\nclear the third world debt. This\nwas strange as most were Italian\nand naturally tanned anyway. They\nlooked a bit scary.\nThe music was amazing; it was\nexactly what I needed after a long\nweekend of harder stuff.\nThe layout of the club is quite\nstrange as there is no main or back\nroom, it\u2019s just two rooms. The lighter\nroom was playing the best of Italian\nfunky house and the dark, smoke\nfilled room had a music policy very\nfitting to the atmosphere. It was\ndark, dirty and rough. I spent most\nof my time in the funky room as\nI could see all of the sexy people\nbetter.\nSome of the mixing was a bit off\nbut it didn\u2019t seem to matter too\nmuch \u2013 people were there to have a\ngood time, and a good time was had\nby all. Many interesting conversations were had as well. This one guy\nwas convinced I was his friend as I\nhad the same mouth as him \u2013 a bit\nstrange, but to be fair to the guy I\ndon\u2019t think he even knew who he\nwas by that stage. Aw, bless.\nThe staff were really helpful and\nhappy too, which is nice. I don\u2019t\nquite understand why, but oh well.\nThe bar staff were incredibly quick\nwhich maintained a high turnover at\nthe bar. Of course this doesn\u2019t come\nfree, as the drinks were incredibly\nexpensive.\nHaving not have slept much between\ngoing out over the weekend and\nwriting these reviews, they don\u2019t\nseem to be too informative. I can\njust say I had a great time at all the\nplaces I went to, but now I think a\nbit of plastic surgery is in order as I\nlook like absolute shit.\nAaron Mason\nThree in a row\nOne of the greatest joys of London clubbing is the all-weekender.

Ten minutes in, after the referee had\nmade his intentions clear,\nour number seven Gareth\n\u201cI\u2019d rather watch from the\ntouch line\u201d Coady was shown\na yellow card for repeated\ndissent.\nAfter some untidy play in\nmidfield by Brighton, the ball\nfell to Rich Bishop and one\nmisplaced box kick into Alex\nBaines-Buffery\u2019s head sent\nthe Brighton number five on\na 30m dash for the Imperial\ntry line. Unfortunately he was\nnot stopped until after crossing it, and we found ourselves\nfive points down.\nDespite the setback,\nImperial continued to make\nholes in the opposition back\nline with our units that\nare Quincy Alan and Ed\nPoulding.\nTowards the end of the half,\nas a result of a crash ball,\nQuincy ploughed into his\nopposite number. There could\nbe only one winner. With the\nBrightonian on the floor in\nwhat seemed to be a slight\ncrater (with his shoulder dis-located), the match paused\nfor a short while.\nPlay was resumed with a\npenalty for Imperial on the\nBrighton 10m line. Somehow\nmanaged to find its way\nfrom my boot to the flag on\nthe try line (touch in goal).\nThis put us on the back foot\nmomentarily, and we conceded a penalty on our 22\nwhich was swiftly dealt with.\nHalf time score: Imperial 0,\nBrighton 8.\nThe second half went\nmuch more to plan. With a\nfew changes in the backs,\nnotably the return of Kieran\nat number ten, we pinned\nBrighton in their half by their\nears!\nIt wasn\u2019t long before Rich\n\u2018Bish Bash\u2019 Bishop was making up for first half blunders.\nNow playing on the wing, he\nintercepted a wayward miss\npass and sauntered under the\nposts.\nWith heads up, tempo\nraised, and victory within our\ngrasp, Imperial scored again\nfrom some beautiful running\nfrom both backs and forwards.\nThis time the scorer was\nnone other than our beloved\ncaptain Steve \u201cI didn\u2019t drop it\nthis time\u201d Barham. Well done\nSteve, we all knew you could\ndo it! A touchline conversion\nfrom yours truly and we were\nahead 14-8.\nImperial were now unstop-pable. A penalty and then\na try from Ed \u2018all thighs\u2019\nPoulding (who was practically crowd-surfed over the\nline) were enough to have\nBrighton all wrapped up in\nribbons, but then again, I\nguess they like that kind of\nthing down there!\nSo it was a comfortable win\nin the end, and a turnaround\nof 80-odd points from when\nwe visited the Sussex-based\nuniversity last term.\nImperial get revenge on Brighton in\ngame of two halves\nRUGBY\nImperial forwards (in the darker strip) jump at a line-out with their Brighton counterparts\n\n"

    "content": "Grossing some $22 million in the\nfirst week alone, Hide and Seek\nlooked like a film that just had to be\nwatched. It boasted a twist that was\nso well guarded it virtually became\na matter of national security.\nBut either our American counterparts are easily pleased or the\nhype was really big, because Hide\nand Seek is in fact an unimpressive,\npoorly-made psychological thriller,\nwhose well-guarded twist turned out\nto be conventional and predictable.\nRobert de Niro stars as David\nCallaway, a New York psychologist whose wife commits suicide.\nWanting a fresh start for himself and\nhis daughter, he chooses to move\nto the country. The small country\nneighbourhood is enough to drive\nany sane person mad and, to top\nit all off, David starts his new life\nin a typical horror film house complete with creaking floorboards, surrounding woods with a ghostly lake,\ndark cupboards, and a basement\nthat resembles a torture chamber.\nAnyone can tell that this is the type\nof house where unpleasant things\nhappen, and it doesn\u2019t take long\nfor it to fulfil its potential. Once in\nthe house, David\u2019s daughter Emily\n(Dakota Fanning) invents an imaginary friend named Charlie, who\nseems harmless enough at first.\nDavid even encourages Emily to\nvent her anger and grief by expressing her emotions through her imaginary friend, but things take a nasty\nturn when Charlie appears to be\nmaking Emily do increasingly gruesome and disturbing things: red\ngraffiti on bathroom walls, a dead\ncat and serious doll mutilation are\na few examples. The race is on\nto find out who \u2013 or indeed what\n\u2013 Charlie is before one of their lives\nis at stake.\nSince this film is a thriller, I can\u2019t\nreveal the twist in the plot; how-ever, it has been done before, and\nit has certainly been done better.\nThe main problem is that the twist\nwas revealed too early, making a\nquick and slick ending the next logical step. Instead, however, the twist\nrevealation is followed by a disappointing and pathetic climax, with\na pointless chase scene through the\nhouse and the surrounding woods.\nThe entire last 25 minutes saw the\nfilm\u2019s twist \u2013 which originally did\nhave some promise \u2013 dissolve into\na complete farce, leaving the audience feeling cheated.\nThe plot contains a plethora of\nred herrings that are all equally\npointless and serve to add yet more\nminutes to the already overdrawn\nfilm. There are creepy neighbours\nconsisting of an intense husband\nand a haunted wife, an estate agent\nwho keeps odd hours, a sheriff who\nhas the keys to every house in the\nneighbourhood and a mysterious-looking cave in the woods. These\nsub-plots, which were not properly\nexplained, did nothing to help the\nstory and only created a sense of\ndiscontinuity.\nPlot aside, the acting was unimpressive apart from Dakota\nFanning\u2019s stunning portrayal of\nEmily. A lot is asked of her in this\nfilm. Her acting has to vary from\nbeing macabre to innocent to tortured to afraid, and she delivers\neach emotion flawlessly and to an\namazing standard. In fact, Fanning\nshows up Robert de Niro, who fared\nfar better as the comical ex-CIA\nagent father in Meet the Fockers.\nOverall, this film is definitely one\nyou should miss. If you are looking\nfor something frightening, you will\nnot get it here unless a few cheap\nshots of things like a cat jumping out\nof a cupboard can make you scream.\nI recommend you stay in hiding and\ncertainly don\u2019t seek out this mediocre thriller.\nHide but don\u2019t seek\nDespite this film topping the US Box Office charts, Marya Ziauddin is not impressed\nwww.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 3 March 2005\n18\nHide and Seek\nDirector: John Polson\nStarring: Robert De Niro, Dakota\nFanning, Elisabeth Shue\nLength: 101 minutes\nCertificate: 15\nHHIII\nFilm film.felix@ic.ac.uk\nDakota Fanning: fast gaining one of the best reputations in Hollywood\nThe true-life story of Paul Rusesabagina\nLet\u2019s set the scene: 11 years ago in\nRwanda, Hutu extremists slaughtered almost a million of their Tutsi\ncountrymen with guns and machet-es. Many of you will remember the\nhorrific images that were broadcast\non the news back in 1994 and the\nsubsequent documentaries that fol-lowed. The Western world stood by\nand refused to do anything \u2013 which\nsounds familiar.\nHotel Rwanda is probably one of\nthe first films to tackle the subject and follows the story of hotel\nmanager Paul Rusesabagina (Don\nCheadle), who ended up sheltering\nand saving more than 1200 people\nduring the massacre.\nThe Rwandan genocide itself is\nsuch a brutal and heart-wrenching\nsubject that any attempt to turn it\ninto entertainment would risk insulting both the dead and the survivors.\nIt\u2019s not surprising then that Terry\nGeorge has chosen to focus on one\nman\u2019s experience in Rwanda. Not\noriginal, I know, but he deals with\nit in such a way that it doesn\u2019t fall\ninto the clich\u00e9d movie territory it\neasily could have. It may get compared to Schindler\u2019s List, and I can\nsee the similarities in that both are\nabout one man who saves a large\nnumber of lives, but Hotel Rwanda\nis far more gritty and real. You can\u2019t\nescape the reality in either film, but\nin this one you can\u2019t hide behind\nthe beautiful cinematography of\nSchindler\u2019s List, which also had\nsufficient space between the actual\nevent and the film\u2019s release.\nI really can\u2019t fault this film. There\u2019s\nno aspect of it that let me down. The\nmusic was amazing and slotted in\nperfectly with each scene. There\u2019s\none scene where you hear children\nsinging a bittersweet song about\ntheir country against the backdrop\nof all the chaos and destruction taking place. I can\u2019t exactly describe\nthis movie as a beautiful one \u2013 I\ndon\u2019t really get my kicks out of dead\nbodies even though I\u2019m a medic\n\u2013 but some scenes were incredibly\natmospheric, both beautiful and\nshocking at the same time. The pace\nis fantastic too. It doesn\u2019t linger; it\ndoesn\u2019t really need to hammer home\nthe point of the film.\nThe real selling point of the film\nis the acting. Each member of the\ncast delivers a solid performance, in\nparticular Don Cheadle and Sophie\nOkonedo who were both nominated\nfor Oscars. Cheadle\u2019s representation of Paul is realistic. The man\nstruggles with his conscience until\nhe finds the courage, partly from his\nwife, to stand up and fight to save\nthese people. He is not a two-dimen-sional character. Initially na\u00efve\nenough to believe all the rhetoric\nhanded down to him by his employers and the western people he\nencounters, he is later shocked by\na conversation he has with Colonel\nOliver (Nick Nolte). Paul realizes\nthat the West does not care how\nmany people die and that the only\nway to save his family and the refugees he\u2019s been left with is to use his\nsuperior intelligence to manipulate\nthe people around him.\nThis film is hard to watch. You\njust want the relentless pain and\ntorture to stop but it never does,\nwhich, I guess, makes it more real-istic. It\u2019s not that it\u2019s drawn out; it\u2019s\njust so exhausting that the message\nseems to have more resonance. The\npolitics is summed up perfectly and\nthe racism displayed by Western\nleaders stays with you long after the\nlights go up.\nIt\u2019s simple. By focusing on Paul\nand his family we see love and even\ncomedy but the film isn\u2019t afraid\nto show you the distasteful big\npicture either. This truly is a film\nthat needs to be seen, but you do\nneed to be prepared to be slightly\nfrustrated. Hotel Rwanda could be\ndescribing so many current situations occurring all over the globe\nand sadly many past and future\nevents too. It shows you the deplorable side of human nature, but also\nthat little glimmer of hope that maintains your faith in humanity.\nHaj Alttahir\nHotel Rwanda\nDirector: Terry George\nStarring: Don Cheadle,\nSophie Okonedo, Nick Nolte,\nJoaquin Phoenix\nLength: 122 minutes\nCertificate: 12A\nHHHHI\n\u201cOverall, this film is\ndefinitely one you\nshould miss\u201d\nDon Cheadle: nominated for Best Actor in a Leading Role at the Oscars\nListings: page 11\n\n"

Can Imperial College help the UK meet its target?\nAs the history of the ice ages shows,\nthe Earth\u2019s temperature has swung\nwidely in the past, long before\nhumans could have had any effect\nupon the climate. Still, most notable scientific studies conclude that\ngreenhouse gases are accumulating in the Earth\u2019s atmosphere as a\nresult of human activities.\nThe greenhouse gases include\nmethane and carbon dioxide, and\nare thus termed due to their ability to\ntrap heat within the atmosphere, as\na greenhouse might. Anthropogenic\ngreenhouse gases, which have been\naccumulating since the start of the\nindustrial revolution, are believed\nby many to be causing large scale\nglobal warming. It is known that\nwarming can cause sea levels to\nrise, glaciers to shrink, accelerated\ndesertification and biodiversity loss.\nHowever, the exact role of the gases\nremains uncertain.\nThe complexity of climatic systems renders it difficult to predict\nexactly what changes will take\nplace, and how quickly. An example\nof an unexpected effect is that the\nmelting ice caps could halt the Gulf\nStream (an oceanic current bringing warm water to the UK from the\ntropics), freezing the UK.\nAlthough it has certainly been\nestablished that the climate is rapidly changing, the media and certain political administrations often\nportray the more relevant debate\n(as to whether the change is human\ninduced) as hotly contested. In real-ity, this is not quite the case, and the\n\u2018sceptics\u2019 are a dwindling band.\nIn fact, a few days ago, evidence\nwas released, by US researchers\nno less, that is considered by many\nto \u201c...destroy a central argument\nof global warming sceptics... that\nclimate change could be a natural\nphenomenon\u201d (The Independent).\nThe general consensus now is that\nsomething should be done to stop or\nat least mitigate this. In 1997, following less powerful legislation passed\nin 1992, governments agreed to the\n(legally binding) Kyoto Protocol.\nThe Kyoto Protocol came into\nforce last Wednesday, February 16,\nseven years after it was agreed.\nThe accord requires the 141 signatory countries, accounting for 55% of\ngreenhouse gas emissions (but not\nincluding the US, which accounts\nfor over 20% alone), to cut emissions\nof carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases by 5.2% by 2012.\nGreenhouse gases targeted for\nreduction under the Kyoto Protocol\ninclude carbon dioxide, methane\nand nitrous oxide. The emission\ntargets are not for each gas spe-cifically, but rather for a combination of the gases weighted by their\nrelative greenhouse effect. Kyoto\ncritics claim that these targets are\ntoo conservative: the consensus\namong many climate scientists is\nthat, in order to avoid the worst\nconsequences of global warm-ing, emissions cuts in the order of\n60% across the board are needed.\nAs such, at best, Kyoto should be\nviewed as a first step in the right\ndirection.\nEach country that signed the protocol agreed to its own specific tar-get, and Britain has said that it will\nreduce its emissions by 5.2% of 1990\nlevels. The Kyoto Protocol has provisions that allow its signatory nations\n(and, by extension, their business-es) to use global markets if they\nundercut or overreach their targets,\nthrough various mechanisms, such\nas emissions trading.\nThis works by allowing countries\nto buy and sell their agreed allowances of greenhouse gas emissions:\nhighly polluting countries can buy\nunused \u2018credits\u2019 from those that\nare allowed to emit more than they\nactually do. Countries are also able\nto gain credits for activities that\nboost the environment\u2019s capacity to\nabsorb carbon, such as tree planting\nand soil conservation. The advantage of emissions trading (which is\nemerging as a key environmental\ntool) is that it ensures that emission\nreductions take place where the\ncost of reduction is lowest, thus lowering the global costs of combating\nclimate change. Equally, the lucrative emissions market will provide\na strong incentive to behave in an\nenvironmentally responsible way.\nThe UK has set carbon limits for its\ncompanies, and a national emissions\ntrading scheme began in 2002, in a\nmicrocosm of the international com-munity. Our own Imperial College,\nwith 11,500 tonnes of carbon emitted annually (last year\u2019s figures),\novershoots its limit and is thus presently set to be disadvantaged by\nthe carbon market. Luckily, a world-renowned centre for research into\ntechnology should have the capacity to reduce its emissions. Even if\nthe threat of exacerbated climatic\nchange cannot motivate it to do so,\nthen surely the prospect of being a\nfinancial loser in the carbon market\nwill?\nThere are a number of ways\nImperial might go about cutting its\nemissions, an obvious one being to\nturn to a heavier dependence upon\nrenewable sources of energy if possible (other universities, like Oxford\nand Sussex, have already achieved\nthis). With an annual energy bill as\nlarge as ours (\u00a37m) this could well\nhelp turn the emissions tide for us.\nBut whatever route we take to fall\nin line with Kyoto, or even capitalise\nupon the market and help swell our\napparently depleted coffers, it is an\nachievable goal.\nSince the carbon market\u2019s incep-tion, 6000 companies in the UK\nreduced carbon dioxide emissions\nby 4.64 million tonnes in the first\nyear, and by 5.2 million tonnes in the\nsecond!\nAside from the obvious benefits\nto students and staff that not wasting money can bring, Imperial\nhas the additional pressure that\nits students, in general, want it to\nreduce its environmental impact:\nin an open survey of over 300 stu-dents, greater than 95% agreed that\nthey felt this way. But in this case\nwe, as students, should also take\nresponsibility and reduce our environmental impact, not just to help\nour university and country adhere\nto Kyoto, but to counter the possibility of our climate changing. And the\npossibility is frightening: some of\nthe most reliable models available\npredict that, almost within our life-times, global average temperature\nwill change by between two and ten\ndegrees celsius.\nFairTrade fortnight begins\nJamie Brothwell gives an overview of 14 days of FairTrade activity at Imperial\nFairTrade Fortnight began on\nTuesday. This two-week period\ngives the opportunity for people to\nre-evaluate their attitudes as consumers and hopefully realise the\nresponsibility that they have to the\nproducers of their food.\nA FairTrade stall will be appearing\nat various places around campus\nover the next 14 days to inform\nstudents about FairTrade and to\noffer a wide range of free samples.\nThere will be all the products that\ncan already be found at conscientious Union outlets at this time, as\nwell as many other different foods\nand drinks which can be found further afield. The stall itinerary is\ndisplayed on the blue panel (below\nleft), and I encourage all to come\nalong and get more information, try\nthe coffees, taste the biscuits, smell\nthe peppermint teas, love the chocolates and support the cause!\nThe FairTrade logo is given to\nproducts which give a fair price to the\nthird world farmer who grew them.\nFor this fortnight, the FairTrade\nFoundation (www.fairtrade.org.uk)\nhas given five very important guarantees for all their products:\n\u25cf The FairTrade mark guarantees\nfarmers\u2019 organisations a fair and\nstable price for their products.\n\u25cf The FairTrade mark guarantees\nextra income for farmers and plantation workers to improve their\nlives.\n\u25cf The FairTrade mark guarantees\ngreater respect for the environ-ment.\n\u25cf The FairTrade mark guarantees\nsmaller farmers a strong position in\nworld markets.\n\u25cf The FairTrade mark guarantees a\ncloser link between consumers and\nproducers.\nFairTrade sales are doubling every\ntwo years and the logo can now be\nfound on over 500 retail and 200\ncatering products. All major supermarkets now stock FairTrade goods,\nalthough with varying degrees of\ncommitment.\nAs I hope you are all aware, our\nstudents\u2019 union does a good job of\noffering a wide range of FairTrade\nfoods and drinks. Looking around\ncampus, we can spot the FairTrade\nlogo in many places:\n\u25cf Tikki caf\u00e9 in the JCR serves excellent FairTrade coffee and chocolate.\n\u25cf The Union newsagent on the\nwalkway stocks a wide FairTrade\nselection of chocolates, flapjacks,\nbiscuits, mueslis and cereal bars.\n\u25cf The BMS coffee shop has a\nFairTrade coffee machine.\n\u25cf DaVinci\u2019s bar sells FairTrade coffee and teas.\n\u25cf The Chaplaincy (East Wing of\nBeit Quad) offers a very good range\nof FairTrade chocolates, cereal bars,\nsugar, teas and coffees.\nWith the \u2018poster-blindness\u2019 that\nmost students now suffer from, it\nis easy to miss the FairTrade logo\nwhen grabbing a coffee and a flapjack over lunch. The aim of this\nfortnight is to make you more aware\nof the choice around you, so that you\ncan make sure that your food and\ndrink is fairly traded.\nPlease make the ethical choice\naround college. It sends out a message to the caterers and managers\nthat Imperial is ready to take responsibility for purchases, and that the\ninexorable journey to FairTrade\nUniversity status must be embraced\nby College and Union alike.\nNow is not a time for moral com-placency. FairTrade status will\nonly be achieved when FairTrade\ncoffee and tea is offered in every\nPhD caf\u00e9, in every catering outlet and for every official meeting\nand event throughout college; when\npeople must actively ask for a non-FairTrade coffee at meetings and\nwhen every vending machine stocks\nsome FairTrade chocolate. There is\nstill much to do.\nThe fortnight aims to raise awareness of the ideals of FairTrade and\nto promote the growing range of\nfairly-traded products available. A\nstall will be set up at various points\naround campus which will offer\ninformation and free samples.\nFAIRTRADE\nSTALL ITINERARY\nTues 1 March Sherfield Walkway\nWed 2 March JCR, South Ken\nThurs 3 March SAF building\nFri 4 March Union foyer, Beit Quad\nMon 7 March Level 3, Sherfield\nTues 8 March Level 3, Sherfield\nWed 9 March JCR, South Ken\nThurs 10 March Level 3, Blackett\nFri 11 March Sherfield Walkway\nA blatant advertisement for FairTrade chocolate bars\n\n"

For many international\nstudents, the plans are likely to leave a bad taste, says Alex Guite\nFor over a quarter of a million international students studying in Britain,\nthe cost of renewing student visas\nwill rise from \u00a3155 to \u00a3250, whilst the\nsame-day renewal cost will double\nto \u00a3500.\nThese huge increases come\nscarcely a year after the charges\nwere first introduced, suddenly and\nwithout consultation, leaving students scrambling around to find\nlarge sums of money they hadn\u2019t\nbudgeted for.\nInternational students shouldn\u2019t\njust be treated as any other user of\nthe immigration service. Many users\nare skilled workers who migrated to\nBritain to earn and can afford to pay\nextra charges. In contrast, international students, attracted by Britain\u2019s\nuniversities, are here to learn. Visa\nrenewal charges are unfair and add\nto the already huge financial burden on international students paying\nmarket rate tuition fees.\nBritish students don\u2019t pay these\nrenewal charges, but they should\nstill be alarmed. Even with the extra\nrevenue for universities when top-up fees are introduced, it will still be\ninternational students paying market rate fees \u2013 totalling a combined\nyearly fee contribution of \u00a31,125\nmillion \u2013 that balance universities\u2019\nbudgets. Yet international students\nface many hardships: often they are\nnot even allowed to open a bank\naccount, have problems accessing\nhealthcare, can only work a maximum of 20 hours per week, suffer\nsocial exclusion and are now faced\nwith this increased visa renewal\ncharge. If enough international students are put off by Britain\u2019s inhospitable welcome, then what chance\ndoes the \u00a33000 cap on top-up fees\nhave of lasting beyond the next\nParliament?\nWorryingly, the evidence already\npoints to a decrease in international\nstudent numbers, at a time when\nmore energy and marketing money\nis being spent on encouraging them\nto study here than ever before. There\nhas been a drop of almost 15% in\nstudent visa applications since 2003,\nand several African countries have\nreduced the number of scholarships\navailable to study in Britain because\nthey cost too much.\nWithin the Government\u2019s policy\non international students there\nlies a paradox: visa renewal charges are completely at odds with\nthe Prime Minister\u2019s own initiative to attract more international\nstudents. Because it is unlikely that\ninternational students will leave\nmid-course, they are treated as a\ncaptive market to pay increased\ncharges in a drive to make the immigration service self-funding. It is\nunfair that genuine international\nstudents should foot the bill for\nabuse and inefficiency elsewhere in\nthe system.\nLast week students, including a\ndelegation from Imperial College\nUnion, picketed the Home Office\nand lobbied their MPs, demanding\nthat students be exempt from visa\nrenewal charges. The fight isn\u2019t\nover and it\u2019s still important to keep\npressure on the Government, as the\nHome Office has hinted that it will\nreview visa charges in 2006.\nWe should value international students as an asset to Britain: they\nbring diversity to our campuses and\nare worth over \u00a34bn a year to the\neconomy. They are here to learn,\nnot earn. They should not be used\nas cash cows as the Home Office\u2019s\nicy grip tightens immigration\ncontrols.\nHuman rights abuse won\u2019t help win\nthe War on Terror\nMarking the start of an Amnesty Society campaign, Kevin Bez explains why the sacrifice of\nhuman rights is creating further difficulties for the US and its allies\n\u201cNearly all men can stand adver-sity, but if you want to test a man\u2019s\ncharacter, give him power.\u201d\nAbraham Lincoln\nAfter the Law Lords\u2019 ruling on the\nBelmarsh prisoners, Jack Straw\ncommented that the right to life\nwas the \u201cmost important liberty\u201d\nand therefore the protection of the\npeople was the Government\u2019s prime\nduty, even at the expense of other\nhuman rights.\nThisargumentstandsindirectconflict with the Universal Declaration\nof Human Rights (UDHR), set out\non 2 December 1948. Its final article\nstates: \u201cNothing in this Declaration\nmay be interpreted as implying\nfor any state, group or person any\nright to engage in any activity or\nto perform any act aimed at the\ndestruction of any of the rights and\nfreedoms set forth herein.\u201d\nThe human rights of an individual\nor a group are not negotiable, and\ncontinued abuse of them will bring\nmore harm to the cause of defeating\nterrorism.\nIn July 2004 the world was deeply\ndisturbed by the news of the Abu\nGhraib prison abuse scandal, an\nevent that will shape the world\u2019s\nperception of America for years to\ncome. However, this abuse of personal power by the soldiers involved\nwas, unfortunately, the grim tip of\nthe iceberg of abuses of human\nrights in the name of the War on\nTerror.\nThe more unsettling part of Abu\nGhraib was that it was far from\nbeing an aberration. The story that\nnever really hit the news is the\nextent of the ongoing human rights\nabuses in the War on Terror. These\nmaltreatments did not only harm\nthe image of the US in the world,\nbut will also negatively affect the\nworld\u2019s effort in defeating violent\nand radical streams of Islamic fun-damentalism.\nThe trail of human rights abuses\nleads from detainments of \u201cterror\nsuspects\u201d in American judicial prisons immediately following the 11\nSeptember attacks, as investigated\nby a Department of Justice report\npublished in April 2003, to an alleged\n50,000 prisoners held in administrative confinement by the US and its\nallies, according to the US Army\u2019s\nInspector General. This route leads\nthrough Afghanistan and Iraq,\nwhere the abuses surfaced momentarily at Guantanamo Bay and Abu\nGhraib.\nIt was an easy task for the BushAdministration to pass the responsibility down to the offending troops.\nOf course, it could be argued that\nnone of the Administration\u2019s high\nlevel officials had a direct involvement in setting policy that facilitated torture. Nevertheless, the\ngovernment still bears the responsibility for ensuring that the country\u2019s\nrepresentatives conduct themselves\ncorrectly according to the Geneva\nConventions and human rights.\nUnfortunately, there have been\ncredible investigations indicating\na contribution by the top ranks of\nthe Administration in setting policy condoning torture and human\nrights abuses, a topic that never\ncompletely hit the public debate in\nmost Western countries. Examples\ninclude denying the \u201cenemy combatants\u201d in Guantanamo essential\nhuman rights such as the presumption of innocence (articles 6-12 of\nthe UDHR have been violated). The\ninfluence of these human rights\nabuses on the effectiveness of the\nWar on Terror is widespread and\nmultifarious.\nFirstly, there has been a measurable increase in sentiment for the\ninsurgents and terrorists. In the\nWestern world, this has mainly been\nmanifesting itself for Iraqi insur-gency. As a result, the mainstream\nmedia has mostly ignored the\ncrimes against humanity conducted\nby some of these groups. Examples\ninclude booby-trapping dead bodies of American soldiers and insur-gents. Never can crimes of one side\nof the conflict justify neglecting or\neven condoning crimes of the other\nside.\nSecondly, the loss of credibility\nsuffered by the US will impede its\nefforts in international engagement\nfor a long period to come. Thanks to\nrelentless power politics during the\nCold War, the mostly unquestioned\nbacking of Israel and the unfair\nmanagement of globalisation, the\nreputation of the US has never been\ngreat among the majority of the\nArab population. The recent human\nrights abuses in the name of promoting liberty and democracy did\nnothing to reverse this perception.\nThe previous two matters arising link into the third major effect\nof human rights abuses: political\npolarisation. While world opinion\nwas not excessively in favour of a\nPax Americana before the invasion\nof Iraq and the Abu Ghraib scandal,\nafterwards the gap between the supporters of the Bush Administration\nand the opposition grew into an\nabyss. This disagreement will\nmake constructive efforts to create\npeace for conflict regions such as\nIsrael-Palestine more difficult and is\nbound to intensify the War on Terror.\nFurthermore, it has also eased the\neffort of terrorist groups: recruitment of young, fatuous individuals\nhas increased significantly due to\nthe new \u2018excuse\u2019 that has been given\nto the radicals.\nThus, continued human rights\nabuses cannot be in the interest\nof the US and its allies. Actually, a\ncomplete and just investigation of\nthe crimes committed will greatly\naid the US not only in the War on\nTerror, but also in future conflicts. A\nclean track record of US forces will\nnot only instill desperately needed\nconfidence in the Western world,\nbut will also cause a consequential\ndestruction of a platform for terrorist recruitment.\nSecondly, it would undo some\nof the long history of hypocrisy of\nwhich the West is rightfully accused.\nShould the US have an intrinsic\ndesire to end the conflict between\nitself and violent Islamic fundamen-talists, then it is time for it to practice what it preaches: respect for\nhuman rights.\nUnfortunately, Britain\u2019s recent\nrecord is not better. Although the\njudicial system in the UK is now taking steps against detentions without\ncharge, evidence obtained under\ntorture is still allowed in British\ncourts. Such allowances are not\nonly in conflict with the UDHR, the\nUN Convention against Torture and\nthe EU Convention against Torture,\nbut also are likely to increase the\nnumber of human rights abuses\ncommitted by authorities. This has\nbeen widely investigated by Amnesty\nInternational in the 1980s and again\nin the last three years.\nThe founding fathers of the UDHR\nlaid out Article 30 for an explicit\nreason: to prevent the abuse of the\nUDHR in the name of \u2018protecting\u2019\nit. It was born out of a time when\n\u201cdisregard and contempt for human\nrights have resulted in barbarous\nacts which have outraged the conscience of mankind.\u201d\nThe US must put a stop the continuing human rights abuses in the\nWar on Terror and undo the damage\nit has done to mankind\u2019s conscience.\nOtherwise it risks jeopardising world\npeace for a long time to come. The\nworld\u2019s only hope now can be that\nthe US learns from the cruelties\ncommitted 60 years ago in the name\nof preserving \u2018our\u2019 way of life.\n\u201cEvery nation that proclaims the\nrule of law at home must respect\nit abroad; and every nation that\ninsists on it abroad must enforce it\nat home.\u201d Kofi Annan\nDetainees at Guantanamo Bay\n\n"
