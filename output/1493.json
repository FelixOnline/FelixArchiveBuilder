The contamination\nfirst came to light when a student pulling an\nall-nighter went to refill his water bottle, only\nto notice it glow a faint green. \u201cWhen I took a\nsip it tasted like someone had dumped a reactor core in my mouth.\u201d Others have described\nit as \u201cUkrainian\u201d, \u201cOH GOD IT BURNS\u201d and\n\u201cslightly astringent\u201d.\nTap water typically contains trace amounts\nof chloride, fluoride, sodium and magnesium,\nas well as a significant amount of hydrogen and\noxygen, so this inclusion comes as a surprise to\nmany. However, readers must be advised that\nhydrogen peroxide also contains hydrogen and\noxygen but tastes a lot more like death. It has\nalso appeared to wipe the smugness from tap\nwater enthusiasts who bang on about how it\u2019s\nsuperior to bottled water.\nAlcoholics in the Union Bar and Young\u2019s\nhave responded to the news with a smug, slightly boozy sense of victory. \u201cSee! I knew water\nwas bad for you!\u201d claimed David O\u2019Pierce before collapsing into a puddle of his own sick in\nthe Quad. When told that bottled water was still\nsafe he responded angrily, \u201cI\u2019ll bottle your ma!\nAnd your donkey...\u201d before passing out.\nThere have been unconfirmed reports of superpowers as a consequence of drinking the\nwater, including super-nerdiness, epic underarm \u2018fuzz\u2019, and a heightened sense of superior-ity. However, it is believed that radioactivity\nonly has the desired effect if administered via a\nspider bite. Hypochondriacs all around campus\nare said to be \u201cvery worried\u201d.\nC\nongressman Weiner has recently been\nin a lot of trouble after sending various\npictures of himself in his underwear,\nand naked, to women he has met on the Internet. First of all, just to clear this one up, that\u2019s\nhis real name. He\u2019s the only politician who\nwouldn\u2019t need to change his name on becoming\na porn star. Starring in politically charged porn\nwhere he hammers some sense into Sarah Palin\nby hammering her senseless. It\u2019s also likely he\nuses \u201cCongressman Weiner\u201d as a pet name for\nit. Congressman Weiner meets Senator Hand\nand they hammer out some legislation together\neventually spitting out a white paper.\nThis all started when Congressman Weiner\naccidentally tweeted a picture of his boxer-covered erection. He had meant to send it privately to a woman as what he describes as a\n\u201cjoke\u201d. The joke was presumably: \u201clook at this\nerect Weiner\u201d. He claimed that his account had\nbeen hacked. As apparently that\u2019s what hackers do; they send women pictures of erections.\nThe most troubling thing is that he didn\u2019t even\ntry to make it look bigger by stuffing his box-ers. What kind of fucking politician shows\nsuch poor judgment as to not make you look\nlike the porn star you sound like? Also he was\njust wearing some plain grey boxers. He\u2019s trying to impress someone and he hasn\u2019t even put\non designer boxers for the job. Honestly what\nthe fuck was he thinking. He deserves to lose\nhis job for such rookie errors.\nHis reaction to all this was to claim that he\ncouldn\u2019t say \u201cwith certitude\u201d that it was not\nhim in the photo. In other words: \u201cOh shit I really regret taking that. Oh wait, hang on, I took\na picture of my dick, but my face isn\u2019t in the\npicture. So for all people know it wasn\u2019t me\u201d.\nAlthough it didn\u2019t help his case out five days\nlater when more pictures, including naked\nones, came to light. Some were semi-naked\npictures he took of himself, with his Blackberry, in the mirror at a gym, as apparently he\u2019s an\nattention-seeking girl on Facebook.\nFinally he held a press conference admitting\nthat he had sent the original photo, and that he\nhad done the same thing several times. He said\nhe was \u201cdeeply ashamed\u201d and that it was \u201cvery\ndumb\u201d showing \u201cterrible judgment\u201d. This can\nonly be talking about the decision taken in the\noriginal photo not to stuff his boxers, or at least\nuse Photoshop to digitally enhance himself. He\nadmitted to swapping naked pictures of himself by sexting as well as emails, Facebook and\nTwitter. How come he has so much time on his\nhands? He said he used his Blackberry and\nhome computer. He must have a good Internet\nconnection or his wife would definitely have\ncaught him feverishly trying to upload a cock\nshot as an attachment to an email.\nHe referred to all of this as a \u201cmistake\u201d.\nThat\u2019s partially true, but mistake usually implies that you accidentally do something once.\nNot that you repeatedly take pictures of your\ncock and send them to women by various different means. The balls up, or actually more\naptly cock up (inside his boxers) was accidentally tweeting the picture.\nIt\u2019s not just sending photos. He also apparently had phone sex with a woman he met\non the Internet. When asked, he said he was\n\u201creluctant\u201d to say exactly what they did. So in\nother words: yes he had phone sex.\nHe called up former President Bill Clinton to\napologise, and swap tips on bitches and hoes.\nClinton probably just took the piss out of him\nfor not even getting a blow job.\nWeiner sends picture of wiener via Twitter\nAlso available in bottled form, for\nthose too snobby for tap but still enjoy\nbeing irradiated\nDRUNKEN MATE OF THE WEEK\nSend your photos to felix@imperial.ac.uk.\nTry not to tweet them by accident...\nHANGMAN\nSurprise entrant for the Felix centrefold\nThose affected will get\nno special treatment,\ndue to it being Imperial\nTwatter\nThe_Cleggomatortrontown <3\nyeah but I\u2019m not telling you her\nname coz you guys will just be\ndicks.

    "content": "FELIX\n10\nBUSINESS business.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFRIDAY 17 june 2011\nBusiness News\nBusiness Editors: Sina Ataherian\nAfonso Campos\nOsborne endorses firewalls\nThe US central bank, the Federal Reserve, is considering setting explicit inflation targets, as used\nby most other central banks, such as the Bank of\nEngland.\nThe Federal Reserve currently uses the so-called\n\u2018dual mandate\u2019 system, where it aims in general\nterms to keep a \u2018prudent balance\u2019 between employment and inflation. Their view is that these two are\ninverseley correlated and thereofre need to be balanced out through central monetary planning. Since\nthis mandate was introduced in the 1960s, the Fed\nhas been able to vary this balance according to per-cieved economic conditions.\nThe Fed Chairman, Ben Bernanke, has long argued\nfor this move to explicit targets. The move may be\nbeing hastened by the growing criticism of the bank\nin recent years.\nFed considers formal targets\nThe Chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne,\nused his annual Mansion House address to the City\nof London\u2019s financial elite to endorse proposals for\nbanks\u2019 retail operations to be ring-fenced from their\ninvestment divisions.\nStrict separation of investment and retail banking\nactivities have been the subject of proposals for dec-ades, and have gone in and out of being law. The latest calls have been growing since the financial crisis\nof 2008. Advocates hope it will limit the impact of\nfuture bank failures of consumers. Opponents see\nit as unnecessarily hampering the ability of banks\nto return to profitability and repay the taxpayer for\ntheir bailouts.\nGreek and Irish debt\nThe prospect of Greece and Ireland defaulting on\ntheir debt is once again on the minds of sovereign bond investors. \u201cIt\u2019s 100 percent certain that\nGreece will default,\u201d according to financial historian\nNiall Ferguson, \u201cThe only question is what euphemism will be dreamt up to cloak the fact that it\u2019s a\ndefault.\u201d\nInvestors are particularly concerned that Iceland\u2019s\nrapid recovery and return to the international capital\nmarkets could encourage the \u201cbankrupting yourself\nto recovery\u201d approach. \u201cPeople should be careful\nwhen it comes to drawing comparisons between Iceland on the one hand, and Greece, Portugal, Spain\nand Ireland on the other,\u201d Iceland\u2019s Finance Minister Steingrimur J. Sigfusson warned in an interview\nin Reykjavik. \u201cIceland didn\u2019t have the ability to save\nthe banks. Trying to rewrite the events that led to\nthat eventuality as some sort of an export product\nis irresponsible.\u201d\nMr. Stigfusson went on to say, \u201cIceland should\nbe humble and avoid advising other countries, especially when it comes to banking. What happened\nwas an emergency situation which couldn\u2019t be\navoided.\u201d\nY\nou might have still been running\naround your primary school\ngrounds in the late 1990s, but\nthe Internet was about to witness its largest market revolu-tion. While Silicon Valley has seen its fair\nshare of bubbles over the last decade, the dot-com bubble that marked the turn of the century\nwas probably the most significant. Now economists warn us that a new bubble may threaten\nthe stability of Internet-based companies: the\ninitial public offering (IPO) bubble. And the\nfirst company to define it is LinkedIn.\nLinkedIn has been known amongst businessmen as a professional Facebook, a tool to make\nnew connections and expand their professional\nnetwork. Launched in 2003, LinkedIn has become the global tool for professional network-ing, now claiming over 100 million members.\nThat is several times less than what facebook\ncan boast about, but there are no 12 year-olds\nthinking the whole world needs to know they\njust had a snack on LinkedIn. It keeps you in\ntouch with people you have worked with or\nmet at a networking event, lets you track a\ncompany, look for and advertise a job or simply find others interested in a business idea you\nhave in mind.\nThe company went public on the 19th of\nMay and sent investors into a frenzy. The stock\nprice skyrocketed from $45 per share to over\n$94 within a day, thus evaluating the company\nat approximately $8.9billion. While that sure\nled to a lot of champagne being drunk at the\nLinkedIn offices in Mountain View, California,\nit prompted market analysts to consider whether the new wave of IT companies to go public\nare considerably overvalued.\nLinkedIn is the first major social networking\nwebsite to go public and therefore became the\nfirst indicator of just how much social media is\nworth in the modern world. What sets it apart\nfrom other social networking websites is the\nfact that it has a clearly defined revenue source\nthat is not limited to online advertisement.\nUsers can choose from a selection of account\ntypes, ranging from the free one to the Executive one. While Executive does sound cool, it\nwill leave you $74.95 poorer per month.\nGroupon now seems determined to follow.\nThe company was founded less than three\nyears ago and is often referred to as the fastest\ngrowing company ever. Despite that claim, it\nstill managed to lose about $400 million last\nyear by pursuing long-term goals regardless\nof short-term consequences. Its latest ambition\nseems to be achieving global coverage, as it\nexpands in other markets such as Japan, Russia and most recently China. What everyone is\nanxiously waiting for is the day Facebook will\nfinally file for an IPO, despite the fact that everyone at Facebook avoids announcing a date\nat all cost.\nInvestors are clearly willing to provide the\nfunds, putting significantly more emphasis on\nthe brand value of the companies than on the\nrevenue and profit generated. What has been\nsold in the market so far has been the potential\nrather than the actual profit that these websites\npresent.\nWhether the surge in share prices of hot\nnew internet companies is another bubble\nlike the one that shook the tech world in the\nlate 1990s remains to be seen, but economists\nmaintain their usual scepticism. California\nhas once fallen for the dot-com bubble and\nthis new one seems remarkably similar. If you\nhappen to have a revolutionary and popular\nsocial network to sell though, now would be\na good time to head up to Silicon Valley and\ndo it.\nLinkedIn\u2019s owners celebrate their IPO by pointing and laughing at the poor people standing beneath them\nA new tech bubble\nAlexandru Podgurschi sees history repeating itself\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX\n20\nTRAVEL\nTravel Editor: Chris Richardson\ntravel.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFRIDAY 17 june 2011\nI\nhave yet to take helicopter gunships seriously. Whenever I hear\nabout them\u2014which has been\nregularly since the business in\nLibya kicked off\u2014I immediately\nthink they are referring to something\nout of science fiction, or at least Bucky\nO\u2019Hare.\nAs you might imagine, this is a far cry\nfrom commuting on the 0702 from Paddington to Didcot. The absence of guns,\nbombs and Kate Adie alerted me to this\nquite early on, and Paddington station\nwas the poorer for it I imagine. What\nI was equally unaware of was any alternative transport to work. If there were\nno fast trains, as happened occasionally,\nI would get a slow one. It would be annoying and take nearly twice as long.\nI moved to London ten years ago and\nhad never really used the tube before\nthen. I had used trains a bit, I went to\nschool in the arse-edge of Kent and so\nin order to go anywhere interesting or\nsee anyone who did not live there, I\nneeded a train. If I did not want to be\naccompanied by my parents that is. I\nwas quite tempted to start driving at age\n17. I got a provisional licence, and was\nkeen to start driving. Perhaps wisely,\nmy parents would not let me drive their\ncars (no idea why) and a year or so later I came to London to go to University anyway, and never needed to drive.\nRelations who live in the country have\nsince told me with a punishing regularity how important it will be to me if ever\nI leave London. And they are probably\nright. And now that I have a PhD and\nam over 25 my insurance premiums will\nbe less than they once were (apparently\nDrs get a discount. Clearly they have not\nseen my friends from ICSM on a night\nout). And I live somewhere where there\nis off-street parking, so not only would\nthe insurance for that be cheaper but the\ninconvenience of it being broken in to\nor nicked would be somewhat reduced.\nSo, there was no longer anything to\nstop me. The expectation was that as\nsoon as my PhD was over and I got a\ndecently-paying job I would get a car. I\nmight have to save a bit, I cannot fit into\na Smart car even if I really wanted to and\na g-wiz looks to me like a self-opening\nsardine tin that will not survive an altercation with a cyclist, let alone anything\nelse. A nice little Volvo or something\nwould work though, I thought. So, only\na matter of time.\nIn the mean time I was offered lifts for\nthings. Clearly the expected standard of\nmy conversation outweighed the palpable decrease in fuel economy that resulted from carting me around and outside\nthe capital. I was never sure whether\nthis balance for my host ever came off,\nbut I never noticed a problem. What I\ndid notice was how long journeys took.\nA few times I was driven from North\nLondon (near Enfield) to West London\n(near Maida Vale). The route took the\nM25 and took no longer than any other\nas far as I could see. But it consistently\ntook comfortably more than an hour and\na half. Sometimes two hours. The Piccadilly line from Oakwood, changing\nat Piccadilly Circus and the Bakerloo\nline to Maida Vale would take an hour\nat most, in fact it can be done in 47 minutes according to the TFL website. If\nyou are a Londoner, you may scoff at\nTFL\u2019s estimates of journey times; rather\nlike getting speeding points if you are\ndriving an old mini in a 50 miles an\nhour speed limit zone, they are more\nsomething to aspire to than to expect.\nHowever, more than occasionally they\ndo turn out to be true (TFL estimates\nthat is, not furious Clarksons in dated\nsmall cars breaking the speed limit). I\nthought little of it after that \u2013 just a quirk\nof those roads or whatever.\nBut more recently (last year) I was offered a regular lift to my weekly riding\nlesson in Surrey. The plan was for a\npick-up just near Vauxhall and a drive\ndown through a combination of mo-torways, A roads and country lanes. It\nseemed a sensible route. I never really\nwent to check this route but reasoning that the driver herself did not want\nto spend more time in traffic than she\nhad to, and basing it on the pace of car\njourneys driven by my parents and so\non, it all seemed normal. There was\na week when my regular lift was not\nthere though. I had taken myself to\nVauxhall, which was always slightly inconvenient but doable, but she did not\nturn up. Ten minutes or so later we exchanged texts to the effect that she was\nill and not coming. Oh well, I will get\nthe train, I thought. So, I got the tube to\nVictoria and got the train down, got a\ncab at the other end and made it to the\nyard in rather less time than it would\nhave taken for the car journey over all.\nI also got the cab-and-train combination on the way back. I did not analyse\nthis at the time, but later realised that\nif getting the train took half the time\nand half the fuss, and half the cost (no\ntube journey to Vauxhall) meant there\nwas little competition between the two.\nAlso, the giver of said lifts and I ran out\nof things to say to one another rather\nrapidly and so a change was welcome\non those grounds too.\nMost recently, I was offered an interview for a job in Exeter. At the time of\nwriting I have yet to make the journey,\nbut looking up the trains, it seems that\nthe railway journey will take 2h24\u2019from\nPaddington. Add half an hour for me to\nget to Paddington and what I am assured\nis a ten minutes walk from St David\u2019s\nstation at the other end and we have a\nround three hours for the journey. The\nAA route planner judges the best road\nroute to be along the M4, loop around\nBristol and then take the M5 down to\nExeter. Another sensible-sounding\nroute. Doubtless the M3 to Southampton and then a sojourn along the south\ncoast would be a pleasing path, but I\ndid ask for the quickest one and clearly that is not it. The quickest route by\nroad appears to be 3h32\u2019, a full half an\nhour longer than the railway one. Not\naccounting for lavatory stops and the\ntractor in front of you of course. This\njourney does also rely upon an average\nspeed of 54 mph. Yeah right.\nWith these examples, one may wonder\nhow the car has ever been useful. And\nclearly it has been and still is. Although\ntrain journeys are increasing in number\u2014the tube now carries 1,000 million\njourneys every year, which it did not ten\nyears ago\u2014so are the number of cars on\nthe road. However, cars are also coming\nunder increasing fire for their environmental impact. I am not sure what impact this aspect has for many 17 years\nolds who are talking their driving test\nbut something one would expect them\nto say would be that driving will give\nthem a freedom to travel. This freedom\nis not free though, as we know from a\nback-of-an-envelope calculation of the\ncost of running a car for a teenage male\nwho has just passed his test. More flexibility than freedom, perhaps.\nYou may have noticed earlier I\nsneaked in that I had used a cab on\nsome journeys and that said journey\nwas much quicker than a car alone\nwould have been. Clearly I would be\ndisqualified had this been a Top Gear\nchallenge, but it was not. What the\ncab did do though, was save me from\nneeding to walk. That part of the journey would have taken me 40 minutes\nrather than the 10 it took in a cab. And\nperhaps that is the point: cars are quick\nif they prevent one from needing to\nwalk, but they are slow when compared\nto railway travel. And slow up against\nrailway travel in Britain?! That is a\npoor showing.\nJust imagine when the slow but sure\nimprovement in railway infrastructure\nmeans fast trains over all of the main\nlines in Britain. It will leave the car\nstanding.\nWhy drive?\nSamuel Furse turns his back on four-wheeled transport (except for taxis)\nPrizes for anyone who can guess what this is a photo of? A train? Hah! How short-sighted.\nThis is a photo of Mankind\u2019s phallic domination of Mother Nature. Isn\u2019t it obvious?\n\u201cThe slow but sure\nimprovement in\nrailway infrastructure\nin Britain will leave\nthe car standing\u201d\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX Friday 17 June 2011 17\nBOOKS\nFELIX\nIan McEwan\u2019s latest book, Solar, is\nprobably the lightest piece he\u2019s written\nto date. It is a departure from the seri-ous, dark tones characteristic in most\nof the work that McEwan is renowned\nfor (such as Atonement, Amsterdam\nand First Love, Last Rites). Solar is a\nsatirical fiction that follows the life of\nNobel laureate physicist Michael Beard\nand satires the current effort in tackling\nclimate change.\nThe novel opens in 2000 with Michael Beard in his fifties. Though one of\nthe most respected physicist in Britain,\nMichael Beard is disillusioned with his\njob as the \u2018mascot\u2019 of the National Centre for Renewable Energy. A hallmark\nof mid-life crisis, Beard finds that his\nwell of inspiration has dried up since\ncoming up with the Beard-Einstein\nconflation which propelled him to fame\nand won him the Nobel. His personal\nlife is tumultuous; after cheating on\nhis fifth wife Patricia, he is at the butt\nend of her recrimination as she starts\non an affair with Tarpin the builder, a\nviolent simpleton who is the complete\nopposite of the intellectual and weak\nMichael Beard. His wife\u2019s affair makes\nhim more drawn to her, as he begins to\nrealize that Patricia is his perfect lover.\nDepressed and jaded, he decides to take\nup an offer to go on an Arctic expedition with a motley bunch of artists to\ndiscuss environmental concerns. Upon\nhis return, an accident triggers a chain\nof events in which the truth is ironic and\nmisunderstood in a very McEwanesque\nway.\nIt is nice to see Ian McEwan foray\ninto comic satire. He is an author whose\nwriting style would fit snugly into the\ngenre: his cynical tone is perfect for satire and his dark, no-punch-held humour\nmakes for a lot of literally laugh out\nloud moments. Some of the best laughs\nare in the first half of the book, especially during the Arctic expedition. As\nusual, Ian McEwan brilliantly sets the\nstage for the pivotal accident in a manner which will sweep you off your feet\nwhen you reach it and ensure that you\nwill not see coming.\nUnlike Ian McEwan\u2019s Booker-winning Amsterdam, Solar felt less well\nresearched. Whereas in Amsterdam,\nMcEwan gets into the head of a composer and the nitty-gritty of compos-I have always been an avid reader, ever\nsince a young age. I\u2019m not picky either\n\u2013 as long as I have something papery in\nmy hands, I\u2019m glad to read it. I\u2019ll read \u2013\nand enjoy \u2013 mostly anything.\nI say mostly because try as I might,\nI just couldn\u2019t enjoy Looking for Mrs\nDextrose by Nick Griffiths. The book\nfocuses on the adventures of Alexander/Pilsbury Dextrose as he attempts to\ntrack down his mother, drunkenly left\nbehind by his father, Harrison Dextrose\non one of his own adventures across the\nglobe. On paper, it sounds like the basis\nfor an exciting story. Why then can it\nnot even raise a yawn from me?\nFirstly, I found it quite dull. In the\nfirst hundred pages, nothing of any note\nhappened. The prime chance to grab my\ninterest \u2013 wasted. I am aware that even\ngreat books take time to build story\nand pace but I don\u2019t think this is one of\nthem. Writers like Tolkien take a great\ndeal of time and pages describing the\nbackground, both of the world and the\ncharacters, and this helps to engage the\nreader. Instead, in this book, Alexander\ntravels to a nearby forest village on an\nerrand that is ultimately revealed to be\ncompletely pointless. The rest of the\nearly part of the book is spent drinking\nin a bar.\nThat too is another problem. I get the\nfeeling that this is supposed to be a funny book but I was left feeling rather un-derwhelmed. Either I\u2019m missing the vast\nmajority of the jokes or it simply isn\u2019t\nthat funny. A great deal of the \u201chumour\u201d\nrevolves around the drunken character\nof Harrison Dextrose but being constantly drunk, asleep or unhygienic is hardly\namusing, in this book at least.\nHis son, Alexander, is not much bet-ter. As protagonists go, he is more than\na bit wet. He comes across as very reac-tive, very rarely acting on his own ini-tiative. The first person narrative from\nhim is a mix of social embarrassment,\nneurosis and cowardice, which is mildly\nentertaining and is the only thing that\nmakes the book readable.\nPlot and character are both pedestrian\nbut there are moments when the style of\nwriting shines through. Griffiths has a\ncolourfully inventive way of describing\nthings, if not always tasteful. I feel there\nis the potential for something better,\nwhich is unfortunately missed out on.\nHowever, that creative style is a dou-ble-edged sword. The book is populated\nby a cast of colourful characters, each\none with their own distinctive accents.\nWhile funny if heard aloud, transferred\nto great swathes of print makes them\nnear unintelligible, obstructing the story\nat hand. Several times I had to stop and\nwork out what a character was saying \u2013\nnever a good sign.\nLooking for Mrs Dextrose is the second book in a trilogy. Based on what\nI\u2019ve read, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll bother with\nthe first or last books. It is not a bad\nbook. It does have its occasional redeeming features if you can summon\nthe will to carry on with it. But I found\nit quite boring, far less than it promised.\nYou can read it for yourself and see if\nyou disagree with my harsh appraisal.\nBut I wouldn\u2019t get your hopes up.\ning music in a way that engages even\nthe music-illiterate readers, McEwan\ndelved less into the physics behind Michael Beard\u2019s field (perhaps not to bore\nreaders), save for the Beard-Einstein\nconflation. The maths behind the BeardEinstein conflation is not described in\ndetail, for obvious reasons. McEwan\ndid however explored climate change\nwith some depth and his description of\nMichael Beard\u2019s experience in the Arctic felt exceedingly real. Ian McEwan\nhimself spent some time with a group of\nscientists and artists abroad a ship near\nthe north pole in 2005, which was the\nbasis for inspiration for Solar.\nThe other thing that lets down the\nbook might be the plot. It may be a bit\nslow for some people, but once it gets\noff it\u2019s a page-turner. There are though,\nsome parts of the book that felt redun-dant, perhaps it\u2019s a symptom of \u2018lack of\neditor\u2019 where a novelist became so famous that the publishing house dare not\nassign an editor to edit the work, thus\nresulting in a draggy plot (e.g. the last\nfew Harry Potters).\nSolar is an enjoyable read with unforgettable comic moments and sharp sat-ire, but it is not Ian McEwan at his best.\nThe misadventures of a Nobel physicist\nIan McEwan\u2019s foray into comic satire\nLooking for a better book to read\nA lacklustre second novel in the trilogy\nGuo Heng Chin\nRhys Davies\nNext week:\nAn epic\nFantasy finale\nWant to\nwrite about\nliterature?\nEmail\nbooks.felix@\nimperial.ac.uk\nbooks.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nBooks Editor: Guo Heng Chin\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX 9\nSCIENCE\nFriday 17 june 2011\nEarlier this year, the Collider Detector\nat Fermilab (CDF) collaboration tentatively put forward new results suggesting that they had observed a new, un-predicted particle. A month later they\npublished more results that seemed to\nreinforce the earlier data. But last week\nthe DZero collaboration, also at Fermilab, announced that they had tried to\nfind the same particle \u2013 and failed.\nDZero and CDF each have their own\ndetector at Tevatron, a proton-antipro-ton collider at Fermilab in Batavia,\nIllinois. The detectors are physically\ndifferent, so data collection and analysis for each happens separately, giving\nindependent results.\nThe events of interest in this case occur when a proton and antiproton collide and produce a W boson \u2013 a type\nof force particle that mediates weak\ninteractions between fundamental\nparticles and two jets of other parti-cles. The rate at which this interaction\nshould occur can be calculated using\nthe standard model of particle physics.\nWhen the CDF looked at the data from\na bunch of events they found that the\nrate at which a W boson was produced\nwith two jets was higher than predicted\nby the standard model. This created a\nbump in the energy distribution of the\ntwo jets.\nOne way to explain this bump is\nthat a particle, with a mass that corresponds to the energy of the bump, was\ncreated during the collisions. But no\nknown particle has the correct mass,\nso the bump seemed to indicate that\na new, unpredicted particle had been\nfound. The statistical significance of\nthe result was just below that needed\nto claim a genuine discovery.\nHowever, when the DZero collaboration tried to replicate the CDF\u2019s results they saw no bump, meaning no\nextra events and no new particles.\nDZero has submitted a paper to the\njournal Physical Review Letters detailing its findings, and the group held\na seminar last Friday to announce the\nresult before publishing a preprint of\nthe paper online.\nSince the DZero and CDF experiments were set up they have published\naround 500 papers between them\nand have only disagreed a handful of\ntimes. This time, the odds seemed to\nCollaborations clash at Tevatron\nKelly Oakes\nProtons and anti-protons are collided in the Tevatron collider at Fermilab\nL\nike recovering alcoholics\neverywhere, Britain has\nwoken up to the declaration of droughts in several parts of the Kingdom.\nQueendom. Whatever it is \u2013 it is dry.\nIt is also the first half of June after a\nstinking cold winter. It is tempting to\nstrike up something British and indignant about why the weather is what it\nis and how exacerbating, inexplicable or\ninconvenient it is. Although British, I\nam also a scientist and am going to take\nthat perspective.\nSuspiciously, or perhaps not, climate change scientists have yet to be\nquestioned publically about this. This\nmight seem reasonable in some con-texts: questioning them as though they\nare any more responsible for climate\nchange than the rest of us is unreason-able. So far water companies and the\nDepartment for the Environment have\nbeen bullied about it on the BBC\u2019s Today programme, but that is only really\nabout short-term measures for human\nwater consumption. What about the\nmore serious long-term aspects?\nThe IPCC and others have published\ndata suggesting that the changes to our\natmosphere will result in an increase in\nthe average temperature of the Earth.\nWhy does it always rain on me?\nThis makes sense given what we know\nabout the physical behaviour of methane and carbon dioxide. Although the\nmean temperature is predicted too imperceptibly to the average person (0.5\n\u00b0C), there will be a decrease in cold\nweather and an increase in the number\nof hot periods. This is mathematically\nrational too. However, we were told that\nBritain\u2019s climate would become warmer\nand wetter. Of course, warmer makes\nsense but that hardly reconciles with the\nfact that we\u2019ve just had the coldest winter in years.\nThe wetter climate is also ponder-able. How is this so? We have flooding in parts of the country that have not\nseen such weather conditions before,\nbut how often these places have witnessed flooding throughout their entire\nhistory is not clear. It is slightly hard to\nwork out what this means. First, meteorologists seem to tout the idea that\nhow wet something is is entirely determined by how often water is poured\nonto it by natural means. This means\nthat places like Antarctica (made of\nice \u2013 for the time being anyway) and\nthe Atacama desert next to the Pacific\nOcean are amongst the driest on the\nplanet. So, does wetter mean wetter or\nwatered?\nWe are in drought before spring is\neven (legally) over \u2013 that rather rails\nagainst wetness, either by being poured\non or by being wet.\nI do not doubt that the climate is\nchanging \u2013 it is a certainty even based\non the chemistry alone. But are we losing sight of it all just a bit? Apart from\na 0.5 \u00b0C increase in temperature which\nis common knowledge, the glaciologi-cal definition of \u2018ice age\u2019 means we are\nin the middle of one at the moment. We\nare also in the middle of a mass-extinc-tion event. In Earth\u2019s history the oceans\nhave been filled with water-soluble iron\noxides and there have been tropical forests at the poles.\nSo how seriously do we take this? It\nis a crying shame that the blue whale,\nthe largest animal ever to have lived\non the Earth, will be extinct in the next\ncouple of thousand years because whaling has reduced numbers and thus the\ngenetic diversity to 1% of what it was\neven 500 years ago. The opposite point\nis that evolution cannot stand still. Like\nlanguage, politics and even reality tel-evision, it has to change and move. The\nloss of amazing and boring species alike\nmakes room for new ones. It is sad that\nthe dinosaurs disappeared, but without\nthat happening, there would have been\nno room for the blue whale or us, come\nto that.\nbe stacked against the CDF \u2013 the Large\nHadron Collider (LHC) at CERN also\nchecked its data to see if any particle\nshows up with the mass expected, but\nfound nothing.\nTevatron is due to shut down in September, as the LHC begins to overtake\nit, but data analysis will continue beyond the shutdown. A task force consisting of members of both the DZero\nand CDF collaborations, as well as\ntheoretical physicists from Fermilab, has already been set up to coordinate a study of the two analyses. A\nspokesperson for the DZero collaboration told the journal Nature that they\nshould already have more than enough\ndata to resolve the conflict.\nSeveral theory papers that try to\nexplain the CDF results had already\nbeen submitted to the online preprint\nserver arXiv before DZero announced\ntheir take on the findings. Even if the\nbump does prove to be a fluke, there\nare many reasons to look for physics\nbeyond that provided by the standard\nmodel of particle physics. Any new\nresult would be added to a long list of\nmotivations for theorists to crack on\nwith developing new models.\nxxx\nRain drops keen falling on my head, but we\u2019re still having a drought.

Ranked 13th for top institutions in\nmathematics, above any non-US institution overall,\nImperial is listed as having 777 papers with 5,369\ncitations as of February 2011.\nDr Emma McCoy, Head of the Department of\nMathematics, said that she is \u201cvery proud of this\nsuccess, which reflects the breadth and depth of\nour world-leading research\u201d and that the ranking is\n\u201ctestament to the years of intense work that has\nbeen put in by many over recent decades\u201d.\nThe rankings involved counting the number of citations per researcher to determine the level of influence the research papers have had and included\nresearch published from 2001 to 2011.\nShe added that the rankings demonstrate the \u201cimpact this research is having, not only in the mathematics community, but in the positive influence\nmathematics has on the world around us\u201d.\nTwo mathematicians were also singled out by the\nrankings as particularly \u201chighly-cited\u201d individuals,\nnotably algebraist Professor Martin Liebeck and\ngeometrician Professor Simon Donaldson, who is\none of the most well known mathematicians at Imperial. Professor Donaldson, widely regarded as one\nof the top mathematicians in the world, received the\nFields Medal at age 29 and is also a fellow of the\nRoyal Society.\nProfessor Maggie Dallman, Principal of the Faculty of Natural Sciences, said that \u201cresearch in\nmathematics underpins our understanding of many\nkey areas of life\u201d and that she is \u201cpleased to see\nImperial is celebrating such international success\nin this field.\u201d\n\u201cWe are also proud to be working collaboratively\nwith researchers, at home and abroad, to fulfil our\ngoals and bring about significant global economic\nand societal benefits\u201d. Alex Karapetian\nUnion election results\nI\nt almost sounds like something straight\nfrom a children\u2019s fairytale: using the\nmilk teeth of children to build a palace.\nBut this is no tooth-fairy-gone-rogue\nstory, rather it\u2019s the inventive collaboration of Imperial\u2019s Professor Sara Rankin and\nartist Gina Czarnecki. The pair aim to move\nthe debate about stem cells away from the controversies of embryonic stem cell research and\nto challenge perceptions about discarded body\nmatter with a new project called \u2018Palaces\u2019.\nThe project\u2019s centrepiece is a 2-metre high\nsculpture made from crystal resin, a \u201cspectacular fantasy palace\u201d that will slowly be covered\nwith children\u2019s milk teeth. \u201cJust as barnacles\ncluster in groups or in the same manner that\ncrystals form and grow, so too will the milk\nteeth spread and proliferate across the surface\nof the palace,\u201d says Czarnecki, explaining how\nthe piece will grow organically over time.\nChildren are encouraged to send in their\nteeth when they fall out and are \u2018compensated\u2019 with a special \u2018milk token\u2019 that they can\nleave beneath their pillow as an I.O.U. for the\ntooth fairy. Professor Rankin jokes that her son\nwanted to know if she had tested the tokens to\nmake sure that they actually worked.\nOne of the objectives of the project is to remind the public that the term stem cells doesn\u2019t\nonly refer to embryonic stem cells, but also to\nadult stem cells that are found in bone marrow,\nteeth, and even fat. \u201cThis is about moving the\ndebate on and increasing people\u2019s understand-ing. The term \u2018stem cells\u2019 get bandied around\na lot because people don\u2019t know that there are\ndifferent stem cells,\u201d says Professor Rankin.\nCurrently, we discard certain \u2018waste\u2019 body\nparts, like teeth, fat from liposuction operations\nThe election results were delayed pending the Union\nCourt\u2019s decision regarding the complaints made\nagainst Returning Officer Alex Kendall \u2013 See Page 4\nCAG Chair \u2013 Heather Jones\nCouncil Chair \u2013 David Smith\nCourt Advocate \u2013 Abdul Patel\nDisabilities Officer \u2013 Charlotte Ivison\nEntertainments Committee \u2013 Jiajun Tan, Alan\nSoltani, Jack Hewitt\nEnvironmental Officer \u2013 Yaroslav Voropayev\nEqual Opportunities Officer \u2013 Dolan Miu\nGender Equality Officer \u2013 Mikhail Nikitin\nHealthy Living Officer \u2013 Joachim Dias\nInterfaith Officer \u2013 Sayinthen Vivekanantham\nInternational Officer \u2013 Hao Gan\nLGBT Officer \u2013 Christopher Schlumberger-Socha\nRAG Chair \u2013 Jack Hewitt\nA more detailed breakdown\nof the results can be found at\nwww.imperialcollegeunion.org\nand umbilical cords, when they\u2019re actually a\nrich source of adult stem cells. The research\nthat Professor Rankin is currently focused on,\nwhich involves trying to activate adult stem\ncells within the body instead for regenerative\npurposes, could see these \u2018waste\u2019 body parts\nbecoming extremely valuable.\nBut this is not only about making a scientific\npoint. \u2018Palaces\u2019 has a much broader and loftier\ngoal of encouraging interest in science. \u201cThis\nis using art, not to illustrate science, but also\nto catch people\u2019s interest and to get them to\nask the questions,\u201d says Rankin. Outreach is a\nlarge part of her academic life. She remembers\nhow visiting an outreach laboratory in Bristol\nas a teenager transformed her life and made her\nrealise she wanted a career in science. \u201cI had\nno idea that research was an option until that\nvisit. That\u2019s why I think it\u2019s really important\nto give that opportunity to as many people as\npossible.\u201d\nAs a PhD student she used to grab up some\nequipment from her lab and head over to\nschools where her friends were teaching and\ndo demonstrations for the kids. As well as the\ngeneral benefits of getting kids interested in\nscience, she says, it was good for them to see a\nfemale scientist. \u201cWhen you ask kids to draw\na scientist, it\u2019s always an Einstein-esque man.\u201d\nShe\u2019s keen for Imperial students to get involved as well.

It\u2019s\nclear that Professor Rankin feels passionate\nabout the importance of outreach. She points\nout that it\u2019s not just the children who benefit,\n\u201cit actually brings a lot to your career in terms\nof communication skills, presentation skills,\nand it\u2019s also a nice diversion from the daily\ngrind of academia.\u201d\n\u2018Palaces\u2019 has received coverage in the major news outlets and has garnered attention\nworld-wide. It will be first exhibited in Liverpool this December, before coming to the\nScience Museum from April\u2013June 2012. The\nplan is to travel the sculpture as much as possible so that children who have donated a tooth\ncan come and see where it has ended up. \u201cI\nlove the idea that children are going to be able\nto give a single tooth, and then later perhaps\nvisit the Science Museum and they can see\nwhat donating something has created,\u201d says\nProfessor Rankin. The hope is that the experience will encourage children to think more\npositively about donating in general and carry\nthat through life.\nThe project currently has around 500 teeth\nbut they\u2019re aiming for around 12,000. The\nteeth so far come from all around the world,\nincluding Brazil and the USA \u2013 they\u2019re asking people to submit their location when they\nsubmit so that they can track geographically\nand chronologically the growth of the project.\nSo does Professor Rankin think it\u2019s at all weird\nthat they\u2019re building a sculpture with children\u2019s\nteeth? \u201cSome people don\u2019t like the idea and find\nteeth a little disgusting, but I\u2019ve been to so many\nschools and all the kids love it,\u201d she says.\nThe Tooth\nFairy\u2019s Palace\nBy Kadhim Shubber\nA sketch of what the sculpture will look like.

    "content": "FELIX Friday 17 JUNE 2011 19\nMUSIC\nFor those of you paying any attention\nto the underground dance music scene\nhere in London, there has been one true\nstar to emerge over the past year, and\nthat is the Boiler Room; yet describing\nit isn\u2019t easy. It\u2019s not a club night because\nto get in you need an invite and it\u2019s usually all over by 11pm. Rather, the whole\nevent is more like a radio show, broadcasting over Ustream to thousands of\npeople sat at their laptops (like I have\ndone numerous times, wishing my life\nwasn\u2019t so dull). Every week, the biggest\nnames in the underground scene make\nit down to Corsica Studios in Elephant\nand Castle to play out to the lucky two\nhundred who got guest list, and to a few\nthousand internet fans across the world.\nThis week marked the first birthday\nof the Boiler Room, and to celebrate,\nthey opened their doors to the public.\nBut this is Techno Nonsense, and I\u2019m\nsupposed to be writing about labels,\nso I\u2019ll get back on track. The reason I\nmentioned the Boiler Room is that it\nis a spotlight for what is happening in\nthe UK\u2019s Bass music scene, and what\nI wanted this article to be about. But\nI couldn\u2019t choose a single label to focus on. Hessle Audio, 502 Recordings\nand Numbers have all put out records\nof such consistently high quality over\nthe past year that you realise your massive hatred for Will.I.Am is irrelevant.\nThe three aforementioned labels have\nreleased music from the likes of James\nBlake, Jamie XX, and many other quality producers who aren\u2019t also current\nbuzzwords at the NME.\nYet there are two sides to the story.\nBen UFO (co-founder of Hessle Audio),\nOneman (founder of 502 Recordings)\nand Jackmaster (Numbers co-owner)\nare all DJs. \u201cSo what?\u201d, you say, \u201ceveryone\u2019s a DJ these days\u201d. True, but\nvery few people actually make any\nmoves in the dance music scene for being DJs alone. Most are producers first,\nLondon Underground: the final installment of Techno Nonsense\nSimon Hunter\nJamie may be an NME favourite but you can\u2019t deny his taste in wool\nachieve popularity and the public assumes they are a DJ, so they all rush to\nsee a Deadmau5 DJ set and have no idea\nthat all they saw was a guy playing his\nown music from his laptop.\nBen UFO, Oneman and Jackmaster on\nthe other hand know what they\u2019re good\nat and stick to it. In any one set from the\nlabel-heads you are likely to hear 1970\u2019s\ndisco, 80\u2019s house music, hip-hop, 90\u2019s\ngarage and tracks that won\u2019t be released\n\u2019til 2012.\nThat\u2019s what makes the scene so excit-ing, you have really talented producers\nputting their own spin on genres such\nas grime, garage and dubstep, and brilliant DJs exhibiting the best in not just\ncurrent music, but music that stretches\nback decades. Can you tell I\u2019m pretty\nexcited about going to the Boiler Room\non Thursday?\nDid you get BONED?\nIf the answer is yes, Gregory Power personally wants to shake your hand\nT\nhanks to the 150 or so ba-dasses who came out to\nBONED at Metric last Saturday! Hope you had a good\ntime. The night was a suc-cess. Check out Christopher Walmsley\u2019s\nawesome pics of the night on the Felix\nFacebook page.Ahuge thank you to Will\nand Chrissie for the sound and lights.\nThanks for all the great performers too:\nThe Inescapable Fate Jam Band, Ramy\nKozman, SMB, Phrij, the rest of the\nlosers from Operation Midnight Climax, our special guest Becoming Real,\nMonsk and utter nutter Niiiiiiiiiiceberrrrrrrrrg.

    "content": "FELIX\n12\nCOMMENT\nComment Editors: Anna Perman\nJan Piotrowski\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFriday 17 june 2011\nI\nt is a strange quirk of the British\nmedia that it is generally harshly\ncritical of the internal affairs of\nour government, yet often almost\nblindly supportive of our affairs\noutside the EU. Consider, for instance,\nNATO\u2019s recent intervention in the Libyan civil war. Major newspapers rarely\nseriously questioned whether the heavy\nbombardment of Tripoli was a breach of\nUN Resolution 1973. More importantly,\nfew major newspapers asked in any\ndepth about why our government was\napparently so keen to use our resources\nto \u201cprotect civilians\u201d in Libya, but not in\nSyria, Yemen or Bahrain.\nThe government\u2019s reason \u2013 \u201chumanitarian concerns,\u201d \u2013 was accepted and\nlauded by many, and treated with cynicism by others. In an interesting (but\nextremely short and under researched)\narticle in The Guardian, Neil Clark\nsuggested that the real reason for the\nintervention was to further Western\neconomic interests in the Middle East.\nRegrettably, he went no further in his\nclaim. At no point did he mention the\nvery important factors in the matter that\nwould have greatly strengthened his ar-gument: that Libya is an oil-rich coun-try; that Gaddafi is an unstable leader;\nthat the rebels seemed to have the upper hand in March, and that a military\nintervention would make the future\n(rebel) Libyan government indebted to\nthe West.\nThat few major British media outlets\nwent any further than to insinuate economic reasons demonstrates the journalistic disease that has been around\nfor decades; very rarely do private media sources stray far from the allegedly\nneutral BBC version of events when it\ncomes to foreign affairs.\nTake, as another example, British involvement in the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia in 1999. At the time, the British\nmedia praised NATO for its intervention\nin the region. After the event, facts came\nto light which demonstrated that NATO\nhad fabricated claims about genocide of\n100,000 Albanians to justify their inter-vention. These claims had been quickly\nswallowed and published by the British\nmedia, and NATO then used this media\nfrenzy to justify their intervention. The\nrevelations about NATO\u2019s exaggerated\nclaims have rarely been published in\nBritish newspapers, presumably because\nthe others fear the embarrassment of admitting that they were wrong.\nIt may seem, then, that The Guardian\nis the pinnacle of quality journalism, but\nI do not believe this to be the case. The\nfact that The Guardian has been slightly\nmore commendable than other newspapers on a number of occasions, does not\nmean that it is much better than the rest\nof the British media. In the article I mentioned earlier by Neil Clark, he gives\nno evidence supporting his claims, nor\nany deep analysis beyond a wink and a\nnudge in the direction of Western impe-rialism. Compare this with the excellent\nrange of articles by Al Jazeera journalists on the same matter with comprehensive source-citation and deep analysis.\nWhat\u2019s more, many of these articles are\nwritten by UK- and US-based writers\n(Joseph Massad, Noam Chomsky, Larbi\nSadiki).\nMany will argue that the Qatar-based\nAl Jazeera will naturally have a more in-depth view of Middle Eastern politics.\nBut surely, the fact the UK is participating in military action demands serious\nanalysis by the British media. If the Iraq\nwar has taught us anything, it should be\nthat government reasons for military intervention should be very carefully and\nthoroughly analysed.\nMedia morons\nWhy is it, then, that the media seems\nso reluctant to question our foreign af-fairs? I get the impression that it may be\na feeling of over-inflated national importance left over from the days of the British Empire.\nWe subconsciously hold on to the ridiculous belief that those outside Europe\nand North America are poor, under-de-veloped barbarians, who need our help\nto be \u201cbrought into the modern world\u201d.\nAs a result, our media institutions take\nthe government\u2019s \u201chumanitarian\u201d involvement in countries like Libya at\nface value \u2013 only our military help can\nboost \u201cthe economy and the prosperity\nand security of [Libya\u2019s] people,\u201d said\nthe Telegraph.\nAlas, it is beyond the scope of this article to directly criticise British (or US)\nforeign policy, but I do think that our\nnation\u2019s attitude towards itself is in dire\nneed of reconsideration. The fact that\nthe most well-researched, and unbiased\njournalism on British foreign affairs is\nfrom a Middle Eastern news corporation\nshould shock our own newspapers into\nrethinking the quality of their articles.\nPerhaps more importantly, it should encourage us to treat what we read, hear\nand see with an even more critical eye.\nBritish media coverage of Libya is flimsy and subservient\nStephen Smith\nHave your say on\nthis article at\nfelixonline.co.uk\n\u201c\nh\nh\na\na\ne\n\u201d\nRarely do media sources stray\nfar from the allegedly neutral\nBBC version of foreign affairs\nThis year\u2019s Summer Ball, which is tomorrow\nif you are reading this on Friday, is potentially a fork in the road. If it proves to be\na great success then the Union will have\nbeen vindicated and there will be a powerful\nargument for its continued expansion. If it\nis not a great success, there will be cause\nto step back and reflect. Either way there\nare lessons to be learnt but they must not\nbe the wrong lessons.\nLet us take the first outcome. That the\nnumber of tickets sold reaches or even defies expectations. That the experience of\nthe majority of students who attend the\nBall is overwhelmingly positive and that the\nincreased focus on live music and the festival atmosphere is vindicated as the right\nmove. The plans that the Union laid out last\nweek, that they have this week clarified as\na \u201cvision\u201d rather than a concrete strategy,\nwill have received a boost. There is no better way to gauge student opinion than to\ncount the number of people who voted in favour with their feet. But the Union must be\ncareful not to mistake this boost for carte\nblanche. They have made the right noises\nabout doing a better job of bringing student\ninput on board, but they must deliver on\nthese promises. The need to plan the Ball\nin advance carries with it the danger that\nstudents are only able to tweak the details\ninstead of building the foundations. In this\nrespect the Sabbs, as student representa-tives, have an important role to play.\nThe alternative outcomes are that the Ball\nis a damp squib or, god-forbid, a unmitigated\ndisaster. There is no denying that this would\nbe a vote of no confidence in the Ball, but it\nwould be wrong to assign blame to this or\nthat aspect of the Ball without evidence.\nIt\u2019s not often that one gets to compare\nongoings in the Union with ongoings in Parliament and Government, but this happy,\nor unhappy opportunity (depending on your\nview) has arisen in the case of the Summer\nBall. The Government was forced to pause\nthe NHS reforms and embark on a listening exercise after the fierce opposition to\nAndrew Lansley\u2019s reforms. The reforms are\nnow substantially changed. If the Ball fails\nto impress, and we hope that this does not\nprove to be the case, we would urge the\nUnion to embark on a similar listening initiative this year, before students leave for the\nsummer holidays and before the groundwork for next year\u2019s Ball begins to be laid\ndown. It would demonstrate the Union\u2019s\nresponsiveness to its students but furthermore it would ensure without any doubt that\nthe plans for next year\u2019s Ball would be finely\ntuned to the wishes of the students that the\nUnion is duty-bound to serve.\nFELIX\nThe right lessons must be\nlearnt from the Ball\nWith its romanticised coverage of the Libyan rebels, is the British media \u2018rolling over\u2019 on Libya?\n\n"

The event was\nattented by over 140 guests including\nnominees for awards, supporting team\nmembers, coaches, teaching staff from\nImperial, various officials, sponsors and\npartner organisations.\nGuests were treated to a selection of\nsnacks on arrival as well as a generous\nspread of alcoholic beverages which\nmade sure that some of the contingent\nwas suitably well lubricated before the\nevening\u2019s events got underway. After\nan introduction by head of Sport Imperial, Neil Mosley, the guests were treated\nto a reception by the England Rugby\nUnion 7\u2019s Head Coach, Ben Ryan, who\nhad come dressed in an England Rugby\nUnion polo to vanquish any thoughts that\nhe may not have been the real McCoy.\nRyan presented a thoroughly descrip-tive, informative and above all interesting story of his life and how he came into\nrepresenting England at schoolboy level\nhe went to Loughborough University to\nstudy a Sports science degree. Incredibly, Ryan recounted how 130 students\nturned up to the \u2018Fresher Rugby Trials\u2019,\nat Imperial we are still working to get\nsuch a turn out. Thirty of that number\nplayed at centre, where Ryan plied his\ntrade. Of those thirty, ten had schoolboy\ninternational honours, an unbelievable\nstatistic.

Following his first year, Ryan\nknuckled down to work and eventually\npossessing his current position within the\nEngland Rugby Union setup. Few people\nwould have been previously aware of\nRyan as the 7\u2019s form of Rugby Union\nis only just gaining prominence, yet he\nhas been in his current job since 2007.\nRyan informed the audience how, after\nDavid Wilson\nreports\nLaura Harreman\nThe Table Tennis Men\u2019s 1st team won \u2018Student Team of the Year\u2019\n...Continued on Page 27\n\n"

He further\nexplained the principles behind the decision, saying that the College looks for \u201cclear benefits from\nthe membership or subscription fees it pays,\u201d which\nin general involves influence on the organisation\u2019s\nstrategy or the receipt of direct services that benefit\nImperial\u2019s activities.\nCaSE Director Imran Khan said \u201csenior government ministers have publicly credited\u201d his organisation with \u201chelping to make the argument for sustained investment in science, and for making sure\nthat the UK\u2019s immigration rules reward science and\nengineering skills.\u201d He said that most CaSE members saw this as a benefit of support CaSE but said\nhe respected Imperial\u2019s right to take a different\nview.

Alex Nowbar\nThe Union Court has ruled that Union President\nAlex Kendall did not act inappropriately when,\nduring the central Union elections when he was\nReturning Officer, he told a student to withdraw\nhis nomination for the position of Community\nAction Group (CAG) Chair. The Court also\nruled that Kendall had not acted in a biased way\nin approving candidate material.\nThe complaint was made on the 30th of May\nby He-in Cheong after Kendall emailed Student\nTrustee-electAbdul Patel at the opening of nominations on the 9th of May, saying that he could\nnot be CAG Chair because trustees cannot hold\nother positions on another Union Committee and\nthen telling him to \u201cwithdraw from the election\u201d.\nAbdul Patel claimed that he had felt intimidated\nby the President\u2019s email and was bullied into\nwithdrawing. Furthermore, the complaint made\nto Union Court argued that the Union President\nwas incorrect to suggest that Abdul Patel could\nnot run for the position, saying that he was allowed to contest the election but would have to\nresign one of his positions if he had won.\nThe Court decided that because Returning Officers had the power to force candidates to withdraw from elections, it followed that they also\nhad the power to force candidates to withdraw\ntheir nomination if they were illegible. On the\nissue of illegibility, the Court decided that candidates should be forced to resign their position if\nthey run for a constitutionally incompatible role.\nOn the question of whether Abdul had been\nintimidated into withdrawing from the election,\nUnion Court clears President\nFormer Rector sacked from board\nSir Richard Sykes, a former rector of Imperial\nCollege, is one of two people to have be ousted in a boardroom coup within the Eurasian\nNatural Resources Company (ENRC) two\nweeks ago. The former chairman of GlaxoSmithKline and now ex-deputy chairman of\nthe Kazakh mining company was removed\nfrom the 14-man board along with his fellow\nindependent director Ken Olisa, after a vote\nby the company\u2019s shareholders who claimed\nthey were tired of the two interfering, The Independent reports.\nThe company was surrounded in controversies regarding their public listing on the London Stock Exchange and Sir Richard is calling\nfor the Financial Services Authority (FSA) to\ntighten its listings rules following the latest disputes which arose regarding corporate\ngovernance. He said that \u201cthere are serious\nquestions to be raised about the corporate governance of companies like ENRC. It should\nnever have been allowed to list on the London\nexchange with such a small free float and such\ndominant shareholders.\u201d\nThe founding shareholders supported on the\nboard by Kazakh government representatives\nare Alijan Ibragimov, Alexander Machkevich\nand Patokh Chodiev. Sir Richard claimed the\ntrio were mad and described his experience\nas having been \u201cmore Soviet than City\u201d, calling for \u201ca much tougher [regulatory] regime,\notherwise London\u2019s reputation will be damaged\u201d.\nThe company entered flotation on the London Stock Exchange in 2007 with less than\n20% of stock available to the public, below\nthe requirement for entering the FTSE 100.\nThe FSA made an exception to the company,\ndeeming it to be large enough for its shares to\nbe liquid. An independent review, however,\nrecommended that the founding shareholder\ntrio, which held 35% of the company between\nthem, should not serve on the board. Flotation\nwas ultimately delayed by six months.\nSir Richard Sykes held the position of rector from 2001 and was succeeded by Sir Roy\nAnderson in 2008. The biochemist was the Senior Independent Director and non-executive\nDeputy Chairman and Chairman of the Remuneration Committee of the ENRC from October 2008. He is currently the Chairman of The\nUK Stem Cell Foundation.\nCommenting to the Daily Telegraph on his\ntime on the board, Sir Richard explained \u201cthe\nreason [he] joined this company was because\n[he] thought it had great potential\u201d and that it\nwas \u201cdifficult to understand why there would\nbe so much conflict.\u201d He reasoned that \u201cit goes\nback to the fact that less than 20% of stock was\nfree float with the rest government stock\u201d.\nThe ENRC have been in a variety of controversies besides the flotation concerns, including their purchase of a mine in the Democratic\nRepublic of Congo and the resignation of the\nchief executive Felix Vulis for \u201cpersonal reasons\u201d in 2010.\nSir Richard Sykes ousted in mining company coup\nAlex Karapetian\nBurgess, Sabbatical Officer for Finances and\nServices at UCL Union, told Felix \u201ca collaboration would only happen if it were on UCL\ncampus\u201d and emphasised the importance of \u201ca\nUCL event on UCL campus.\u201d UCL has previously staged its Summer Ball off campus but\nmoved it back due to overwhelming negative\nfeedback from its students. In response to Imperial\u2019s offer of collaborating in a future Summer Ball, Burgess said, \u201cWe feel it\u2019s a nice idea\nbut wouldn\u2019t move the event off our campus.\u201d\nA senior Union official told Felix that the expression of interest came from a \u201csenior staff\nmember\u201d at UCLU and that not having UCLU,\none of the largest Student Unions in London,\non board would have a \u201csignificant impact\u201d on\nfuture plans for the Summer Ball.\nThe spokesperson said that the Union will\n\u201cconsult heavily with Imperial students next\nyear to determine the steer for next year\u2019s\nevent\u201d and emphasised that the Union would\n\u201cfirst and foremost\u201d plan a Ball that fulfilled\nthe wishes of Imperial students above \u201ca wider\naudience.\u201d However, the spokesperson also\nsaid that plans for a London-wide student Ball\nwould be would need to be in place before the\nstart of the new term. It is believed therefore\nthat feedback from this year\u2019s event will play\na crucial role in determining the future of the\nSummer Ball.\nThe Summer Ball will be held on Saturday\n18th June. Tickets are \u00a345 until midnight\non Friday 17th June and then \u00a350 on the\ndoor. Tickets can be bought from thesum-merball2011.com.\nUnion clarifies Ball plans\n...Continued from Front Page\nthe Court argued that if there was any damage\ncaused by the initial email, it was remedied by\nthe emails that followed. Through several emails\non the 9th of May, and a Facebook Chat con-versation, Kendall explained in more detail to\nAbdul Patel his options. The chain ends with an\nemail from Abdul Patel in which he says that he\ndoesn\u2019t have the time or resources to mount a\nstrong enough campaign against his possible opponent for CAG Chair and then goes on to thank\nthe President for his \u201cinvaluable advice.\u201d The\nCourt Chair Hamish Common said that although\nAbdul Patel later claimed that the real reason\nthat he withdrew was because he had been in-timidated, there was no direct evidence that he\nhad not meant his words when he said them.\nAlex Kendall apologised to He-in Cheong,\nwho brought the complaint on Abdul\u2019s behalf,\nfor the language he used in emails to her while\ndiscussing the complaint. In an email sent on the\n31st of May, Kendall called her \u201cbloody pathetic\u201d and accuses her of being corrupt. Although\nhis conduct towards He-in Cheong was not the\nsubject of the complaint, Kendall admitted that\nhis behaviour was inappropriate.\nComplaint that Kendall intimidated student not upheld\nCourt Chair Hamish Common (left) ruled\nin Kendall\u2019s favour acted appropriately\nKadhim Shubber\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX Friday 17 june 2011 13\nCOMMENT\nH\now many times have you\never wanted to tell someone who is apologis-ing to you, to **** off?\nNot because they slept\nwith your best friend, but just because\nof the grovelling, sickening nature of\nit. I amaze myself about how fervently\nI want to sometimes. But equally, how\noften has an apology barely scratched\nthe surface of the wrong it is attempting\nto right?\nThese two examples are relatively easy,\nbut what about the middle ones, when\nsomeone probably should apologise and\ndoes? There are various approaches one\ncould take. Some people thank them. I\nam not so sure about this, but it would\nshow an acknowledgement of the apologiser\u2019s effort. However if you think they\nshould apologise, why thank them? I suppose the opposite reaction would just be\nto say nothing and walk away, but this is\nhardly positive re-enforcement. What if\nthey need to do it again? The chances are\nthat they simply will not bother. Telling\nthem \u201cIt\u2019s fine/It doesn\u2019t matter\u201d is one\nI have done in the past, but I feel a pang\nbecause often, it does matter. Though I\nRhys Davies\nSamuel Furse\nDon\u2019t forget to remember...\n\u201cIt is not just\napologies that make\nfor an etiquette\nminefield\u201d\nThe minefield of social etiquette\n\u201cWe are a thousand\nconversations. If we\ncouldn\u2019t remember\nthem, who would we\nbe?\u201d\nflatshare all add to the pile. There is even\nan unwritten rule about the use of mobile\nphones on trains, i.e. the more people\nthere are on a train, the more you should\ntry to avoid using your phone. Of course\nsome people do not care about such rules,\nbut everyone around them is silently firing large telepathic daggers squarely at\nthem.\nI suppose the question is partly \u2018why\ndoes any of this happen at all?\u2019 Why do\nI worry about what to say to someone\nwhen they apologise to me, or when a\nwoman with a predilection for 80s fashion invites me to a party I don\u2019t want to\ngo to? We are supposedly a less \u2018buttoned-up\u2019 society than we were 50 years\nago. People dress differently, and formal\ntitles are less common. However casual\nracism and people who wash only once\na week have also become less common.\nIronic really, as people who indulge in\nthese activities are normally called com-mon. Or at least are thought of as common \u2013 no one is allowed to say it, that\nwould be snobbish. Etiquette is clearly as\ntricky a mistress as ever she was \u2013 be her\nin a spandex boob tube or grovelling for\nyour forgiveness.\nam pleased they have said so, I do not\nnecessarily want to wear that pain on my\narm. I want to move on. I suppose there\nis the big hug and \u201cI\u2019m-so-pleased-youcalled\u201d combination, but anything more\nclearly from a cheap American drama, I\ncannot imagine.\nDodgy-coloured hair, breast augmentations and accents that make me want to\nrip off my ears aside, it is not just apologies that make for a modern etiquette\nminefield, but a variety of \u2018new\u2019 situa-tions. I was asked if I wanted to go speed\ndating last week. I am reliably informed\nthat this has changed a lot \u2013 it is not the\nlonely stalker-fest that it is believed to be.\nBut that does not help with the etiquette\nof the situation. Clearly in one\u2019s three\nminute slot, the need for jokes about unchristian acts with a banana are unlikely\nto go down well. After all, one has hardly\nmet the person, it is just not the time.\nHowever a more circumspect approach\nmight just leave me with nothing to say,\nand so I would come across much like\n\u2018Tim nice but dim\u2019.\nIt is not just these sorts of things people\nworry about \u2013 what to say and when,\nhow to behave, what one expects in a\nI\n\u2019m a bit embarrassed. Y\u2019see,\nyou\u2019ve caught me at quite an inopportune moment. I was going\nto write this letter on something\nimportant, I\u2019m sure of that. The\nonly thing is... I can\u2019t remember what\nI was going to write about. You don\u2019t\nhappen to know, do you? Wait! Hah, got\nit! Memory, that\u2019s what it is.\nIt\u2019s a funny thing, isn\u2019t it? For a start,\nwe\u2019re not quite sure where or what it\nis. We know roughly where to find it\n\u2013 temporal lobe, second left at the hippocampus \u2013 but after that, our sat-nav\nbreaks down. And while we can come\nup with some pretty theories to explain\nmostly how it works, we still haven\u2019t\ngot all the kinks worked out.\nD\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, for example. I, myself, have\nit from time to time. Some say it\u2019s a\nneural quirk, adding a notion of familiarity to the novel but I\u2019m not entirely\nconvinced. Some mornings I wake up\nthinking what an odd dream I just ex-perienced, that it could never happen,\nonly to be left slightly spooked when\nit comes to pass a few weeks later. It\u2019s\nsomething like having my very own Oracle of Delphi behind my retinas.\nOf course, remembering things before they\u2019ve happened is strange in\nitself but there are still oddities even\nwhen causality flows in the proper di-rection. Despite being the foundation\nof my current academic achievements,\nI can remember very little of my days\nin primary school. Fair enough, it was\na long time ago. And yet, I remember\nvividly Mrs. Gulliford shooting me the\nmost poisonous look after I yawned in\nclass. This one, inconsequential memory is the only thing I can pluck from\nthe murky mists of that past. So far, this\npearl of synaptic-firing has been of no\nuse to me whatsoever and I can\u2019t envisage a future when it ever would. But it\nis implanted so firmly in my consciousness I know I\u2019ll never forget it, even to\nmy final days.\nThat\u2019s the strange thing with mem-ory, or one of many at least. We don\u2019t\nremember what is important, what is\nuseful: the bones of the wrist before an\nexam, the interview time with a prestigious company or the phone number of\nthat girl from Metric. Instead, our heads\nare filled with junk: the word \u201ccustard\u201d in five languages, the number of\npecks in a bushel, Ann Widdecombe\u2019s\nbirthday.\nBut, then again, I might have this all\nwrong. Obviously an ordered and detailed memory is useful where exams\nare concerned but life is more than a\ntest. Maybe there is some gatekeeper\nin our mind, more acute and astute than\nwe could ever hope to be. Maybe this\nsubconscious bouncer only retains what\nreally is important. If I were ever examined on my life, I know I\u2019d never get\n100%.\nMemory is one of the things that\nmake us who we are. Even in Imperial,\na personality isn\u2019t formed by learning a\ntextbook by rote. It\u2019s crafted over time\nthrough myriad interactions with those\nwe know, those we love, those we hate.\nWe are a thousand conversations. If we\ncouldn\u2019t remember them, who would\nwe be?\nI can\u2019t remember what kind of bike\nI was riding when I got lost in Pontypridd but I can remember how glad\nI was to see my Dad again, even as he\ngave me a rollicking. I can\u2019t remember\nwhat they asked when I came here for\nmy admissions interview but I can still\nfeel the thin film of sweat that coated\nme as I walked out of the room. I can\u2019t\nremember what film we went to see on\nour first date but I remember perfectly\nhow my girlfriend looked, stood there in\nGloucester Road Station. This memory-demon has better things to worry about\nthan facts and figures, dates and times.\nIn fact, I can\u2019t even remember the date\nproperly. I know it was roughly a year\nago. Almost exactly a year. Wait, actu-ally, it was a year ago to... Oh dear!\nThe Summer Ball is, for many,\nan opportunity for a final party\nwith friends before the summer\nholidays or even the job market\nfor anyone finishing their degree\nand so, rightly, students want a\nsay in how they say goodbye to\ntheir year or even their degree.\nThe fact is that students were\ninvolved in making this decision.\nYou elected the Deputy President\n(Finance and Services), the President and the Ents committee to\ndo this job.\nThese 6 students, elected by\nthe student body to put on this\nevent (amongst other things) decided to make changes, some\nforced by practical necessity, the\nborough Council imposing restrictions changing what we can do\nand when, and some out of choice\nbut it\u2019s important to remember,\nthese are the people that you,\nthe student body elected to make\nthese decisions. It\u2019s also important to remember that you had a\nsay in whether or not these decisions stood. When Union Council\npassed reports by the DPFS that\nstated more of college would be\nused, the event would start earlier and that there would be no\nmarquee on the Queen\u2019s Lawn\nstudents had a chance to make\nthe changes they wanted.\nLast week an article was published saying that the Union has\na long term strategy to expand\nthe Summer Ball to Hyde Park.\nWe\u2019d like to clarify that this is not\na strategy that has been brought\nbefore the Executive Committee\nof the Union or to Union Council and voted upon. It is an idea\nand a vision for the future from\nthe people that the student body\nelected to put on this event \u2013 not\nnecessarily one shared by every\nstudent or student representative but the vision of the people\nstudents voted for. Any change\nof venue would need to be discussed at the Executive Committee and Council of the Union.\nA Summer Ball in Hyde Park\ndoesn\u2019t necessarily reflect the\nwishes of the student body \u2013 ultimately it is not our opinion but\nyours that matters. This year\u2019s\nSummer Ball will be a fun day for\neveryone who comes but if there\nare changes you\u2019d like to make\nfor next year then please come\nforward and make your voice\nheard.

    "content": "FELIX\n16\nARTS\nArts Editor: Rox Middleton\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFriday 17 june 2011\nA\nn artist and a scientist\nwalk into a bar. They find\neach other incomprehensible and mysterious and\nfail to have a meaningful\nconversation. They leave vowing never\nto move out of their comfort zone again.\nNot really funny is it? Before I continue,\nI must declare an interest in writing this\narticle. I am involved in organising collaboration between Imperial College\nand the Royal College of Art (probably\nthe UK\u2019s premier post-graduate school\nof art). This daring plan is codenamed\nArtifact. But more on that later...\nIt is almost a truism that the worlds of\nart and science are totally isolated from\neach other; isolated by their collective\nrolls, methodologies and goals. In my\nbelief this is symptomatic of a dangerous lack of understanding between\nthese two vital components of a functional and vibrant culture. Studying, as\nwe do, in a university exclusively dedicated to science and engineering it is\neasy to forget that there are other modes\nof thought, just as necessary and valid.\nThere is even a degree of hostility directed towards other areas. During the\ndebate over higher education funding\nI heard a number of colleagues angrily\nquestion why degree subjects, other\nthan the sciences (and grudgingly law)\nreceived funding at all when they \u201cgave\nno benefit to society\u201d. A particular hatred was reserved for degrees like fine\nart. The lack of understanding swings\nboth ways. I once fell out badly with a\nfriend who claimed that \u201cmy relentless\nlogic left me dead to the dead to beauty\nand spirituality\u201d. For the health of our\nfriendship we now avoid discussion of\nall philosophical matters.\nAs an engineer with a strong interest\nin the arts I feel compelled to challenge\nthese attitudes. Yet it is hard to deny\nthat a real gulf exists. I would love to\nargue that the distinction we make between \u201cgeeky types\u201d and \u201carty types\u201d\nis a false one, but I do not believe that\nin all honesty I can. In my experience\nthere is a genuine difference in patterns\nof thought. As scientists, we are trained\nto be ruthlessly rational and filter everything we observe and conclude through\na strictly logical framework. In contrast\nart graduates have been taught to develop their intuition and exhibit heightened\nsensitivity to the subtleties of emotion\nand aesthetic. Being used to thinking in\na particular way makes it very difficult\nfor one group to understand the work of\nthe other unless pains are taken to make\nit particularly accessible. This is a gen-eralisation, there are plenty of individuals and even institutions who bridge the\ngap but they are the exception rather\nthan the rule.\nSo given these problems, what does\nArtifact hope to achieve? I have already suggested that the culture clash\ncan cause hostility but I think there is\na greater danger; that of missed oppor-tunities. When science and art come\ntogether some pretty spectacular things\ncan happen.\nThe mysterious world of research and\nthe insights it offers frequently serves\nas inspiration for artists. You may have\nspotted the work of Helen Pynor, creator of \u2018Headache\u2019 (Felix No#1479).\nHere an artist, so affected by contact\nwith Imperial\u2019s very own Dr Dexter,\nwent on to produce a piece dedicated\nto exploring brain diseases. In my view\nthe controversy surrounding her use of a\nhuman brain unfairly distracted the public from a good news story. A respected\ncontemporary artist and a top researcher\nwere working together to raise public\nawareness of multiple sclerosis and Parkinson\u2019s disease in a thoroughly laudable and effective manner.\nExamples of art inspiring science are\nundoubtedly harder to come by. However the arts in general can certainly\nprovide a driving force for research. An\nexample of this is the reactive dyes now\navailable to fashion designers. A lot of\nthe finance and motivation for advances\nin this area has come from the fashion\nindustry. I recently spoke to a textiles\ndesigner working with our chemistry\ndepartment to develop CO2 reactive\ninks. Clothes made from these fabrics\nblacken in atmospheres with high emis-sions; clearly a spectacular way to highlight environmental concerns.\nArtifact has taken its cue from another example of people from different\nworlds exhibiting a total inability to understand each other, men and women. A\nspeed dating event took place last term\nwith Imperial and Royal College of Arts\nstudents and staff invited. The mark of\na successful match, was not romance,\nbut an eagerness to work together on a\ncollaborative project. The fruits of these\npartnerships, drawing on the strengths\nof both parties will grace the walls of\nThe Blyth Gallery this September.\nThrough the collaboration we hope not\nonly to give people a glimpse into life\non the other side but to develop real\ndialogue between members of these two\ninstitutions.\nStudents from Imperial and the Royal College of Art team up\nin daring collaboration. Meredith Thomas reports\nArtifact Collaboration\nEmma Emerson (left, top) Lizzy Griffiths (left, bottom)\nMy name's Lizzy Griffiths and\nI've been studying Biochemistry at Imperial for nearly two\nyears. I've always loved drawing and painting, and although\nmy parents made sure I didn't\npursue art as a career, it has\nremained a hobby that I always\nhave time for. I am part of the\nLeonardo Fine Arts society here\nat Imperial and do the occasional\nillustration for Felix, so a joint collaboration with a member of the\nRCA seemed like a great idea.\nOur project involves growing fabric from a bacterial culture, which\nis exciting because it is making\nart out of living organisms; it also\nties in well with my biochemical\nbackground. We hope to make\na structure out of this fabric that\nwill be displayed in the Blyth Gallery over the summer, which will\nbe a fantastic opportunity to\nshow how art and science can\ncomplement each other\nEmma Emerson is currently\nstudying a RIBA Part 2 Architecture Masters at the Royal College of Art.

She has been involved\nin organising the 2009 London\nFestival of Architecture with RIBA\nLondon and spent a month with\nthe British Council in Venice at\nthe 12th Architecture Biennale.\nThe upcoming Artifact exhibition\nwill present an investigation into\nthe architectural potentials of a\nspecific organic textile grown from\na culture of bacteria and yeast.\nThis collaboration has provided\na platform to initiate discussion\nsurrounding sustainable futures\nthrough an exploration into Biological Architecture and cutting-edge\nsymbiotic materials.\nChlo\u00e9 Brillatz Elliott P.

He is\nin the Design Interactions department at the Royal College of Art,\nand previously earned a bachelors\nin industrial design at Carnegie\nMellon University in Pittsburgh.\nIn the past, he has worked with\nstart-ups, non-profits, and government agencies.\nThe work for the Artifact ex-hibion, in collaboration with Chlo\u00e9\nBrillatz, is a historical recounting\nof the efforts of geologist August\nHaquet, who in 1968 was the first\nto propose the notion that portions of the planet are not native\nto Earth. The project will take\nthe form of reenactments of moments from Haquet's work. A series of photographs from this reenactment will be the final output,\nalong with a recorded reading of\nthis fictional history.\nChlo\u00e9 Brillatz is a UCL planetary science masters student.\nShe studied maths and physics in classes pr\u00e9paratoires in\nParis and engineering geology\nat L'Ecole Nationale Sup\u00e9rieure\nde G\u00e9ologie de Nancy in France.\nLast year she worked for two geo-technic engineering companies in\nParis and in San Francisco. She\nenjoyed being a geotechnic engineer but she wanted to discover\nresearch in another field she\nlikes \u2013 planetary science. She\ngot in touch with Artifact because\nshe sees in sharing scientific\nknowledge a way to improve human minds and human societies.\nAccording to her, universe exploration gives humility and respon-sability to people. In that sense\nshe works with Elliott Montgomery to share scientific knowledge\nand to raise ethical questions\nthrough art.\n\n"

    "content": "the volcano. Becky managed another inhuman feat in the burning temperatures\nand thinning oxygen by racing the instructor up the tiered sandy hills. I took\nthat opportunity to take a personal break\nin the car just being glad it wasn\u2019t me.\nThe next day involved \u2018voluntary\u2019\nwork at a local Peruvian school for children living in extreme poverty. Taking a\nbus to the outskirts of Arequipa we were\noverwhelmed with the basic nature of\nthe area; unfinished one brick wall thick\nhouses, dirt strewn streets, rocks, rub-ble, children with dusty faces picking\nthrough the rubbish, and then one small\nthree roomed school in which they could\nlearn English and Spanish. After sweeping and mopping we lay in wait for the\nscrum that formed at the gates. Suddenly there came a deluge of tiny children\ncalling us \u201cteacher\u201d and pulling at our\nsleeves asking us to show them how to\ndo a jigsaw puzzle, listen to them displaying their counting talents or even\ngive them a piggy back ride. After being\nused as the local lift service around the\nplayground from a series of three year\nold boys who gave me no rest, not even\nwhen I lay flat on the playground floor,\nwhere they all grabbed a leg and an arm\nand tried to spin me round, we made our\nway exhausted but filled with a sense\ncontentedness from the day.\nOn a whim, as the night crept in, we\naccepted an invitation from one of the\nvolunteers at the school to a local rock\nconcert of a famous Argentinean band.\nJoining the 9000 strong crowd we listened to a mixture of salsa, heavy rock,\nmetal and Bob Marley covers as the\nlight faded over the city, and it disappeared to become thousands of flickering electric lights in the distance as figures danced in the shadows.\nOn our final day in Arequipa as we\nbustled through the streets back to our\nhostel the ethereal sound of classical\nBeethoven violin music floated in the\nair. Stopping, captivated, Becky stared\nin to the Plaza D\u2019Armas. \u201cWhere do\nyou think that is coming from Becky?\u201d I\nasked, wondering what orchestra could\nbe playing at this time of the day in Peru.\n\u201cWhatever it is, it is beautiful\u201d Becky\nreplied. In answer to our question the\nlocal garbage truck trundled round the\ncorner, blasting the choral symphony\nfrom its speakers with a toot of its horn.\nFarewell Arequipa and your odd singing\ngarbage trucks, your white colonial build-ings, your chequered travellers trousers,\nextreme sports, still-active volcano and\nabsorbing Inca history. As the Peruvians\nshout and drum their feet whilst on their\npublic bus service, shouting in their driver\u2019s ear \u201cVamos! Lima! Let\u2019s go!\u201d the time\nhas come for the end of this trip, final stop,\nLima and then we shall see you very soon.\nFELIX 21\nTRAVEL\nFRIDAY 17 JUNE 2011\nReturn of the Mummy\nA\nrequipa, informally\ntermed \u201cla ciudad blanca\u201d due to its luxurious\nwhite buildings, almost\nArabic in stone and\nconstruction, lies in the Andes mountains overlooked by the looming snow-peaked volcano of El Misti, which\nrises majestically some 5822 feet above\nthe city. Bordering El Misti lay the summits of Chachani and Picchu Picchu,\nthe superstitious \u201cApus\u201d or Inca homes\nof the Gods and spirits controlling the\nnature of the universe, nestling this ancient town and UNESCO world heritage\nsite below their watchful eyes.\nOur first stop in this beautiful, dusty,\nsun-baked landscape was the museum\nto see a fourteen year old Inca maiden,\nJuanita, who was sacrificed at the top of\nMount Ampato through a mixture of a\nsedative drink and a blow to the head.\nHer body was an appeasement to the\nrestless earthly spirits who had, in the\nInca philosophy, caused the latest natural disaster in anger against sins of the\nArequipian people. Left in a shallow\ngrave with metallic llamas, embroidered\ncloths, bowls and scallops, her body frozen in ice was preserved for hundreds\nof years and discovered by chance in a\ncrater to now find itself inside a glass\nrefrigerator. Here tourists can peer\nthrough their fingers and mist to gaze\nat her sinewy shrivelled muscles, still\ngrowing long black hair, crooked teeth\nor hunched-over posture. Undignified\nas her current state may be, she allows\na unique vision of a primitive, glorious\nand difficult period in one of the most\nfascinating bygone human civilisations.\nFollowing this, and abandoning our\nplans to fly over Nascar to visualise the\nmysterious Inca crop circles due to several plane crashes and escalating prices,\nwe decided to take our lack of water\nability and raft down grade 4 rapids up\nPriya Garg visits Arequipa, sees a Incan mummy and cycles down an active volcano\nChilli Creek (with several paddles).\nSuitably dressed like two M&Ms in yellow puffy buoyant jackets, we added\nhelmets and wetsuits then clambered\nin to our raft with one guide, one safety\nman and one extra canoe whose sole\npurpose seemed to be to spray us in the\nface. Splashing over rocks through the\nAndean wilderness was a mixture between cold fingers, exceptionally beautiful scenery and a shot of adrenaline.\nOne particular highlight was when the\nguide told us, \u201cnow hold on and when I\nsay get in the boat, you get in the boat,\u201d\nonly for a huge wave to overthrow the\nraft causing speedy propulsion of its\npassengers downwards with the current,\nBecky losing grip and disappearing into\nthe rapids. Luckily she was fine, and I\ngot my come-uppance the next morning\non our cycle ride down an active vol-cano.\nCycling El Misti, I had neither factored in the gravel and sand path, nor\nthe lack of suitably sized bikes. Hence\nonce at the peak, the massive distance\nbetween the male bike\u2019s seat and han-dlebars, meant that when perched upon\nthe bike it felt like riding a Victorian\npenny farthing over six foot boulders\nwith each crunch, bump and skid jud-dering all the way through our arms\nand shoulders. The constant squeeze of\nbrakes formed bruises on the surface of\neach palm. Far from being Lance Armstrong, it was more like a toddler with\ntraining wheels, slowly taking each\nskid and sand dune as it came. Becoming slightly more confident I looked up\nto see our descent down the path of the\nvolcano and promptly my front wheel\nlocked and flew out of a pothole, throwing me off my seat and both my bike and\nI down on to the sand path.\nNeedless to say, I was more relieved\nthan Becky being on a ten hour toilet-less bus bursting for a pee, when we finally encountered an asphalt road where\nI could freewheel down to the base of\nRafting on Chilli Creek\nPhotos by Priya Garg\n\u201cIt felt like riding\na Victorian Penny\nFarthing over six-foot boulders [...]\neach bump juddering\nthrough our arms and\nshoulders\u201d\nVolunteering at the local school\nErmm guys? I think we\u2019re cycling towards the active volcano? Guys?\n\n"

In the constitution it stipulates that all full members of the Union,\nwhich includes Sabbaticals, have a right\nto participate in all Council discussions.\nAlthough the practice of asking the\nSabbaticals to leave the room is a longstanding unwritten rule, the Court ruled\nthat it violated the Union\u2019s constitution.\nIn the decision to deny Ravi Pall Honorary Life Membership, some Council\nmembers cited what they deemed to\nbe an unsatisfactory effort throughout\nhis year in office. The RCC Chair, Nathaniel Bottrell, pointed to the Deputy\nPresident\u2019s short written report for that\nCouncil meeting as indicative of his ef-forts. The members subsequently voted\nwhether to confer Pall with member-ship, with five voting for and six against,\nalong with 10 abstentions. Union President Alex Kendall explained his misgivings about the Council\u2019s decision: \u201cRavi\nhas done a great job this year and has\nbeen a very proactive Sabb. He has a\nstrong personality and this can sometimes test some people\u2019s patience but he\nis a good man and has had to deal with\nsome tricky issues this year.\u201d\nRavi Pall argued that because a lot of\nhis work involved sensitive staffing is-sues, it was impossible to report fully\nto Council. He said that Council members \u201cmassively underappreciated the\namount of effort [he] had put in\u201d due to\nthe loss of two permanent staff mem-bers, the Finance Manager and Commercial Services Manager.\nWhile no complaint was made against\nthe result during the meeting, one made\nafterwards led to the issue being discussed at Wednesday\u2019s meeting of the\nUnion Court.\nUnion Court Chair Hamish Common\nsaid that it was \u201cwith a heavy heart\u201d that\nhe quashed Council\u2019s decision because\nCouncil had not knowingly acted improperly and that it was common sense\nto ask the Sabbaticals to leave the room\nwhile they were being discussed; he\nsuggested that it would be a good idea\nthat the constitution be changed to allow\nthis practice to continue.\nAn emergency meeting of Council\nmet on Thursday lunchtime but it was\nabandoned as it was not quorate. Another meeting has been scheduled for\nthe 22nd of June, when Council will\nagain decide on HLMs for the sabbatical team.\nCouncil denies DPFS Honorary Life Membership\nBut Union Court\nquashes decision due\nto unconstitutional\nvoting procedure\nMatt Colvin\nPresident\u2019s Awards\nSenior Stewards Team\nDan Wan\nSimon Archer\nCinema Society\nPhysics & Medicine\n(for undergraduate\nrepresentation)\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX\n8\nIn brief\nSCIENCE\nScience Editors: Kelly Oakes\nCharlie Harvey\nThea Cunningham\nscience.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFriday 17 june 2011\nCatching a wave\nPhysicists have come one step closer to unveiling\nthe elusive quantum world with a new experimental\nmethod developed by Canadian scientists. The ar-ticle, published in Nature, shows how a team from\nthe National Research Council of Canada Institute\nfor National Measurement Standards were able to\nperform a direct measurement of the wavefunction\nof a photon, which is the elementary unit, or \u2018quanta\u2019, of light.\nThe wavefunction is central to quantum theory\nand is a complex distribution which completely describes a quantum system. In contrast to everyday\nexperience where the state of an object, such as\nits position or momentum, can be precisely deter-mined, things become fuzzier in the quantum world.\nParticles can be here or there, and Schrodinger\u2019s\ncat can be dead or alive. The Catch-22 (until now, at\nleast) was that by attempting to measure a quantum\nobject, its wavefunction would \u2018collapse\u2019 to a new\nvalue and then evolve as a different wavefunction.\nJeff S. Lundeen, one of the authors of the paper,\ncomments, \u201cA feature of the wavefunction is that,\nunlike a water wave, the very act of observing it\nchanges it, making it a slippery object to measure.\u201d\nThe team were able to circumvent this problem by\nperforming two complementary measurements of\na photon in succession; one \u2018weak measurement\u2019\nwhich is gentle so as not to disturb the wavefunc-tion, followed by a second normal (or \u2018strong\u2019) mea-surement. Although the weak measurement lacks\nprecision, accuracy can be regained by averaging\nover many measurements.\nIn the experiment, individual photons were generated by attentuating laser beams. The position of\nthe photons were weakly measured through measuring their polarisation. A lens was then used to select\nfor photons of a given momentum.\nAnother intriguing aspect of the experiment is how\nthe imaginary components of quantum numbers can\nbe made manifest. Observables from strong measurements are real numbers while the mathematics\nrequires that weak measurements can have real and\nimaginary components. Both the real and imaginary\nnumbers can be realised in the dial of an apparatus:\nthe real component determines the position of a\npointer, while the imaginary component determines\nthe momentum kick. This new method for observing\nthe quantum world will be vital to fields as diverse as\nquantum information and drug discovery.\nMelissa Lever\nIt was on a cool, clear autumn day in northern Minnesota when two scientists, driving\ntowards a fieldwork station, stopped for gas. It\nwas at this petrol station that Martin Saar and\nJimmy Randolph had a flash of inspiration that\ncould one day help in the fight against climate\nchange.\nRoad journeys in America are notoriously\nlong, allowing many long discussions to be\nhad. On this particular trip, the men had only\ntwo things on their mind. Firstly, the work they\nhad been commissioned to do by Minnesota\nGeological Survey on the potential for storing\ncarbon dioxide in the local area. And secondly,\nthey talked about Jimmy\u2019s current research\ninto geothermal energy.\nGeothermal electricity production works on\nthe principle that the Earth has, deep down,\nvast stores of heat energy locked up. Water can\nbe pumped into fissures in these rocks, where\nit can heat up. Once back at the surface the water can be used to drive a turbine. Geothermal\nenergy requires no fuel, so it is one of the least\ncarbon-intensive power sources. As global targets for carbon emissions become stricter, geothermal energy is becoming more widespread.\nTo meet the targets, an alternative to using\nlower-carbon electricity is to remove the existing CO2\nfrom the atmosphere. Known as\ncarbon capture and storage, the CO2\nis stored\nunderground as a liquid where it cannot act as\na greenhouse gas.\nThe big \u2018eureka\u2019 moment came when Martin and Jimmy realised these two disparate activities could be combined. Instead of simply\nstoring the liquid carbon dioxide underground,\nwhy not use it to extract energy from the earth\nto create electricity as well?\n\u201cIt really was a brainwave\u201d, says Martin. Although only half-joking at the time, three years\nlater the pair are well on the way to making the\ntechnology a reality.\nThe idea, known as CO2\nPlume Geothermal\n(CPG) involves circulating the liquid CO2\nthat would normally be stored underground\nthrough geothermally heated rocks. CPG has\nmany advantages over its rivals. CO2\nis much\nbetter at extracting heat from the rocks than\nwater. In addition, the landscapes used for\ncarbon capture are vast. So large, in fact, that\nif all available sites in the US were used, the\nentire electrical generating infrastructure could\nbe rendered carbon neutral. The traditional\nmethod relies on fracturing the rock to allow\nthe water to flow. This, however, can lead to\nseismic activity. In Basel, Switzerland, for ex-ample, a geothermal plant had to be shut down\nafter it caused an earthquake.\nSuch dramatic incidents never fare favourably with the general public. Although CPG\nhas a greatly reduced seismic risk, it is associated with carbon dioxide \u2013 a term that has\nbeen vilified in the media for years. \u201cClimate\nchange advocates go on the news and say CO2\nis dangerous and it\u2019s bad, and then go on to say\n\u2018oh, by the way, we\u2019re going to inject it under\nthe ground where you live\u2019\u201d, says Dr LaForce,\nwho researches carbon storage at Imperial\nCollege London. She has seen numerous CO2\nstorage projects delayed or killed because of\npublic disapproval. \u201cUnfortunately with this,\nand with any CO2\nstorage project, the barriers\nare not so much technical as they are social.\u201d\nAs well as lack of public support, carbon\ncapture schemes have come under fire producing CO2\nthemselves. CPG could change all\nthis. \u201cThis approach could make carbon capture economically feasible as the power generated from the geothermal heat at these sites\ncould run all the pumps and other electric systems required\u201d, says Martin. As well as removing CO2\nfrom the atmosphere, it also creates\nelectricity with very low emissions.\nAs fossil fuel stocks run out, and oil prices\nrise ever higher, projects like CPG are likely to\nbe come increasingly more attractive, and even\nindispensable if we are really serious about reducing our impact on the atmosphere. Maybe\none day, geothermal energy and carbon capture will make petrol stations, like the one that\ninspired Martin and Jimmy three years ago, a\nthing of the past.\nCharlie Harvey\nUsing carbon dioxide to fight warming\nStoring CO2\nunderground can help reduce quantities in the atmosphere, and help generate clean electricty as well\nBurning fossil fuels releases billions of tonnes of CO2\ninto the atmosphere each year\n\n"
