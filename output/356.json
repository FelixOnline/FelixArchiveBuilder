However, with this latest\nalbum, \"Queen II\", it is very unlikely\nthat they'll ever need to have connections with their previous vocations\nagain.\nThey appeared in a big way, some\ntime ago, with their first album,\n'Queen'. This received rapturous\nacclaim from most critics and their\nlatest album has been long awaited.\nThe album has a new concept.\nThere is no side one or two. Instead\nthere is a black side and a white side.\nThe white side is written by Brian\nMay (guitarist, B. Sc. (Physics)\u2014Imperial College, Ph.D. student, infrared astronomy) with a track by Roger\nTaylor (drums). The black side is\nwritten by Freddie Mercury (vocals,\nfashion designer). The fourth member of the band is John Deacon (bass,\nB. Sc. (electronics)). Brian and Roger\nFrse Story\nWhat can I say that hasn't been\nsaid before. In five years of existence\nFree created the kind of music that\nshould have earned them the recognition that's been afforded to the\nStones, Cream, Hendrix, ELP, Led\nZepplin, etc. Why they never got it\nI 'll never know. This album only goes\nto enhance my belief that in the last\ndecade Free have proved themselves\nto be amongst Britain's Top Bands,\nand their final split is a loss to the\nwhole music business. The album\ntraces Free's history from the first\nalbum, 'Tons of Sobs' way back in\n\"68 through the two splits to the\n'Heartbreaker' album. It's hard to give\nan accurate picture of the band's music in just 20 tracks when you've\ngot 6 albums worth to choose from.\nEven so Island have done a great job\nand there will be few people who\nwould disagree with their choice of\ntracks. Every track is a gem and the\nalbum's a classic. Whilst this album\ndoes go a long way to tracing Free's history it will never replace most\npeople's memories of the band, memories gained at exciting and near\nriotous live gigs.\nWhilst Free never captured their\nlive sound in studio recordings, they\ndid leave us some very fine music on\nrecord. 'All Right Now\" is an obvious\nexample of this and its success in\n1970 along with that of the album\nTire and Water' should have heralded\nthe beginning of better things for\nFroe. However, the relative flop of the\noriginally were in Smile and Queen\ndeveloped from them.\nThe record has to be heard to be\nbelieved. Brian's guitar work is such\nthat they print on the album sleeve\n\"and no-one played synthesis er... again.\" For a newcomer to Queen\nthis is necessary. The range of sounds\nthat Brian produces are beyond description and defy comparison with\nprevious material.\nThe production of the record is\nalso a top class piece of work. To\nlisten on mono equipment would be\na sheer injustice. Full use has been\nmade of the fact that stereo records\ncan carry different information in the\ntwo channels.\nHopefully, their management will\ntake note of the fact that the gig they\ndid here last term was probably the\nturning point in their career, and will\nacknowledge this with the offer of a Great Hall gig next term. If this happens then don't miss them.\nIn the meantime, beg, steal, borrow\nor even buy a copy of \" QUEEN II\"\nand remember the following quote\n\"Queen are set for the big, big time.\nAnd nothing\u2014but nothing\u2014is big\nenough to stop them.\"\nfollow-up single 'The Stealer' and the\ndepressing sales of the album 'High-way', signalled the beginning of the\nend for Free. Bewilderment within the\nband about why the follow-ups\nflopped caused discontentment between its four members. The band\nwere just round the corner from being extremely big yet they themselves\nwere disillusioned by the seemingly\nnever-ending work they'd have to do\nto achieve this success. Personal differences built up and led to the original split. After going their own individual ways, without much success,\nthe band reformed, cut the fine album\nFree at Last' and started touring. Bad\nluck dogged them yet again, and Paul\nKossoff's ill health and the concerts\nconsequently cancelled helped to\nenlarge the still present personal differences, which precipitated the second split. With a completely different\nline up Free returned, for a while, but\nit just wasn't the same band.\nPaul Rogers, Paul Kossoff, Andy\nFraser and Simon Kirke will be remembered individually and collectively for the magnificent music they produced during the five years of Free;\nbut it is very sad to see Island limiting\nthe production of this Record Set\ncommemorating their work to 50,000.\nTry and get hold of a copy if you\nhaven't got all the Free albums, it's very good listening and well worth\nthe money.\nTracks are I'm a mover; I 'll be\ncreeping; Mourning sad mourning;\nAll right now; Heavy Load; Fire and\nwater; Be my friend; The stealer;\nSoon I will be gone; Mr. Big; The\nhunter; Get where I belong; Travelling man; Just for the box; Lady; My\nbrother Jake; Little bit of Love; Sail\nOn; Heartbreaker; Come together in\nthe morning. .\nI.

Comfortable seats with\nplenty of leg-room, tasteful decor and\nfriendly staff. It is mainly directed at\na young audience (e.g. normal price\n\u00a31.30 and 70p but the \u00a31.30 tickets\ncost only 50p to all students and anyone under 21).\nThe latest production, performed\nby the Dolphin Theatre Company, is\nOscar Wilde's \"The Importance of\nBeing Earnest.\" Mr. Peter James,\ndirector, is presenting here a play\nthat rarely manages a showing in\nLondon nowadays.\nThe directing, however, leaves\nmuch to be desired. Although not in\nthe classification of \"Upper Class\"\nmyself, it is obvious that a gentleman\nof the standing of Mr. Algernon Moncrieff (Terry Taplin) would never\nspeak with his mouth full of cucumber sandwiches. What is more no such\ngentleman would maintain such an\nactivity. Nor would he bellow: a gentleman's tone is seemly.\nTo convert Lady Bracknell (Betty\nMarsden) into a throbbing ly tremulous Lady, whose cry out \"a hand\nbag\" is merely that of pain, is wrong:\nLady Bracknell is here a slightly severe romantic and the young ladies,\nGwendoline (Polly Adams) and Cecily\n(Louise Purnell) are hardly the decorously lethal things they should be.\nTo comment on the dialogue of\nsuch a well-known play would be use-less. It is, however, amusing and the\nactors (despite the poor directing) do\ntry to put over the upper class Victorian attitude. Recommended, especially in view of the excellent ticket\nprice reduction.\n. S.

LEWIS\n(These can be bought boxed for about\n\u00a31.65, or individually for about 30p each).\nMany people have read Tolkein's \"The Hobbit\" and \"Lord of the\nRings,\" not so many, perhaps, are\nfamiliar with the writings of Tolkein's close friend and associate. Professor\nC.S. Lewis. Lewis was a prolific\nwriter, his writing covering many\nareas; science fiction, philosophy and\nliterary criticism to name but a few.\nHe also, however, wrote a series\nknown as the Narnia Chronicles which\nare similar in type to the \"Lord of the\nRings\" although the Narnia books are\navowedly allegorical. The Narnia\nChronicles comprise seven books:\n\"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe,\" \"Prince Caspian,\" \"The Voyage of the Daan Treader,\" \"The Silver Chair,\" \"The Horse and his Boy,\"\n\"The Magician's Nephew\" and \"The\nLast Battle.\"\nThese books cover the history of\nNarnia from Creation to Apocalypse\nand as well as being rattling good\nyarns, they contain some profound\nphilosophical and metaphysical com-ment. In my recent experience, these\nbooks are becoming very popular in\nthe same way that \"Lord of the\nRings\" became popular. I can recommend these books as very interesting,\nenjoyable and entertaining reading.\nAdrian CR. B. Maranatha.\nCINEMA\nWARMER Exorcist\nA lot has been written about \"The\nExorcist\", not all of it particularly\ncomplimentary. It has been variously\ndescribed as boring, horrific, strong\nand (my favourite) \" . . . a nasty little\nfilm.\"\nGoing to the preview last week I wasn't quite sure whether I had made\nthe right decision or not. Also, for\nin the wrong place,\nthe first few minutes I thought I was\nThe film is about the demonic possession of a12 year-old girl. The slow\nbeginning (in fact it takes nearly half\nthe film) is spent in giving a family\nbackground to the girl. Once the\npossession starts, great use is made\nof short scenes. These alternate\nbetween seva ral associated locations\nand the girl's bedroom. It works\non keeping the audience guessing\nwhat will be the next horrific happening on return to the bedroom.\nAmongst these are mast ur bait ion with\na crucifix, the spewing of thick, green\nvomit, more obscenities, than I care\nto mention and the rotation of the\ngirl's head through a full 180\ndegrees.\nThe build-up to the actual exorcism\nis somewhat slow and atri ffe overdone though the acting of the leading\nplayers is very good. The exorcism\narrives, and a[ though the main outcome is never in doubt, there is a strange, unexpected result.\nThe actual effects are well done,\nand the make-up of the possessed\ngirl's face excellent.\nI would not class this film as even\nremotely approaching a classic. It\nis, without doubt, a very powerful\nand much above average horror f lim, but that is as far as it goes No\nprofound theological arguments, just\nplain shock.\nSee it by all means, but be careful\nwhat you eat and drink before going.\n\n"

When the computer centre\nis un staffed, e.g. during holidays, a systems error\nwill stop processing. The new configuration will\nsupport 192 terminals, which will triple the existing number.\nIf the plans for installation are followed, the\nnew service will commence at the beginning of\nnext session. The first year of usage is free\n(as a result of the generosity of CDC). At the\nend of the first year, the hire charge can be set\nagainst the purchase price, and with further discounts the cost becomes \u00a3356,000 (compared\nwith a list price of \u00a3552,000).\nAny views on the computer centre's operation/\nimage?\nAt present a College working party is examining the image/effectiveness of the Computer\nCentre at IC.

Piss artists\nshould have no place at Imperial College, or anywhere else for that matter. Is it clever to stick paper\nfull of shit on a wall? Do students think it right to\nmess in fire buckets and to vomit everywhere\"? What\nis far more important is: Is is fair to ask women\ncleaners to clean up this appalling mess'? The image\nof students, not only Norman Sayles, but everyone\nat College is at risk. None of us wishes to see the\ngood relations now existing between students and\nworkers at IC destroyed by a group of students\ndevoid of any form of decency.\nRON PARKER\nThe above is a straight crib from the \"Action\nNews\", I.C. NUPE newsletter. I don't think any\nmore need be said.\nFAST As pre-reported in the\nlast issue, a fast took\nplace last week. This\nwas undertaken by 15\nmembers of the college\nbranch of Amnesty International, a body whose\nmain concern is the political prisoners in countries around the world.\nThey work a system\nwhereby each group\n\"adopts\" upwards of\nthree prisoners and\nworks for their release\nand also raises money\nfor families and relatives. Most of the members who took part in the\nfast were sponsored (for\nso much per hour fast-ing) and some raised up\nto \u00a350 by fasting for 72\nhours. A total of nearly\n\u00a3200 was raised in this\nmanner, plus at least a further \u00a320 from dona-t ions. Also, as part of their\ndemonstration, a cage,\nsimilar in size and shape\nto those used by several\ngovernments as cells for\nthe prisoners, was placed outside the Southside\nmain entrance and during the refectory hours,\nseveral of those on the\nfast remained in there,\ngiving an indication of\nthe cramped and inhumane conditions that\nthe prisoners have to\nsuffer.\nThe picture shows\nDerek Barnes (centre),\nthe College Anglican\nChaplain. inside the\ncage, accompanied by\nSteve Parkinson M.E. II\n(left) and Paul Handirick\nMaths II (right).\nNUS put in\ngrants claim\nThe first thing the\nNational Union of Students did when Mr. Reg\nPrentice was named as\nEducation Secretary was\nto send off their grants\nclaim.\nWhile not exactly en-amour ed of Mr. Prentice,\nthe union think there will\nbe more co-operation\nduring talks on the claim\nfor a \u00a3655 minimum\ngrant. Mr. Steve Parry,\nthe union's national sec-ret ary, said Mr. Prentice\nwould have to fight to\nget the Labour Party's policies on education\nimplemented.\n\"We are certainly\npleased to get rid of\nMrs. Thatcher,\" Mr.\nParry said. \"I hope he\ndoesn't attack the Left\nin the student movement\nin the same way as he\nhas attacked the Left in\nthe trade union move-ment.\"\nLOW GRANTS DETER\"\nSAYS VICE-CHANCELLOR\nLarge numbers of students might\nbe put off from going to university\nbecause their grants are too low, says\nDr. Harry Pitt, vice-chancellor of\nReading University.\nThe falling off in demand for higher education, together with competition among universities, polytechnics\nand colleges of education for students and resources, could produce\na \"national problem which is both\ngrave and absurd\", he sold the annual\nmeeting of the university's court.\n\"We may well be at a point where\nsubstantial numbers of potential students are deterred from entering university by purely financial difficulties\nand this at a time when they could\nbe absorbed at a very small marginal\ncost.\n\"It is now generally accepted that\nthe grant is now, and has been for\nseveral years, less than required to\ncover a student's living costs, even at\na minimal level.\n\"The so-called Anderson Principle\nhas, therefore, already been breached\nand it is plain that the present generation of students will be at a disadvantage in comparison with their\npredecessors and that many of them\nwill have real difficulty in bridging the\ngap between their expenses and their\nincome.\"\nStatements like this are very we l come, especially in view of the fact\nthat there is a new Government.\nHopefully Reg Prentice, the new\nMinister, will take note of Dr. Harry\nPitt.\nRON KILL\nDEPUTY PRESIDENT\n1974-75\nJAQUI GERRARD\nHON.

However, we did not\nleave unnoticed \u2014 our poor injured captain was\nthere to wave us goodbye\u2014mainly because he\ncouldn't work out how to get four rail tickets under\na Southside door. His journey was not wasted how-ever. We sold LSE the four tickets for ate nner \u2014\nit kept us in beer money for a while. . . .\nBut that's another story! Mike Welford was our\nsole representative in the four mile Youth race\n(is he still under age?). He saw the course at its\nbest, and true to form ran at his worst coming\na masterful three hundred odd out of only a few\nmore.\nIn the 6 mile Junior event we finished a team\nwith lan Ellis finishing quite well up coming 152\nfollowed by Dave Houlbrook 194, Keith Ahlens\n213 and not quite last Pete Johnson 218.\nThe only Senior foolish enough to brave the by\nnow very muddy 9 mile course was Steve Webb\nwho eventually finished after being gone for the\nbest part of an hour in position 894\u2014about 100\nfrom the back.\nThe running now finished we got down to the\nserious business of drinking. Two scouts were sent\nto explore Sheffield looking for an off-licence, but\nthen discovered the pubs had opened. Dave and\nSteve were reported to have run the fastest mile\nof the day getting from the pub back to the train\nwith the beer.\nWednesday, 5th was the date of the last London\nColleges League race. At the end of the previous\nLeague race the 1st team were in the precarious\nposition of being 3rd in the 1st division 7 points\nahead of Royal Vets. However Parly Hill took its\ntoll and we failed to retain this position, eventually finishing 4th behind vets. Notable performances of the day were lan Ellis in 20th place and\nanother lan (making yet another comeback) in 81st place. Other team results were the 2nd team 4th, the 3rd team 9th, and 4th team (super 'W's)17 th, all in division 2. All, however, was not lost, as\nlan managed to wangle medals for the 4th team\nin division one this year. This was celebrated in\ntraditional style with yet another jug evening (I really don't know how Pete can afford to buy all\nthose jugs).\nSaturday, 9th the runners went yet again to\nParly Hill for aU.L. match and the P.A.'s went to\nLewisham for some training on Young's Ale. The\nfirst streak er of Wimbledon was reported to have\nbeen seen doing press-ups on the changing room\nfloor. If any Gaysoc member wants the address of\nthis place please contact 'Sailor' c/o Union Letter\nRack (under'S'). The Fire Brigade relay on the morning of Sunday, 10th deserves a write up but I can't remember too much about it as, like most present, I was\nrecovering from Saturday night. Granny set the\npace in first leg covering the 3 mile course in\napprox. 15.40. The times then got worse, Dave\nJones doing 16.30, Pete Johnson 18.19 and Steve\n17.00. Pad defected to LSE and did his usual job\nas a fifth columnist returning in a time of 18.24.\nWe finished 44th but this could have been improved upon somewhat if members of our regular\n1st team had put down their ale and run instead of\nsome of the above mentioned runners.\nFuture events include the 5,000m 'all stars'\nrace, the dinner and Isle of Man trip at Easter.\nAnd on that note if anyone has a large plastic\ndustbin (no lid) that is guaranteed watertight, and\nthey are not using it at Easter please contact C.H. Under, ,c/o Union Bar. We might need it for the\nboat crossing.\nA happy easter to all our readers.\nW.W. GOLF\nTHE SOCIETY TRAIN ARRIVES\nAT ITS WATERLOO\nIt is never pleasant to record a defeat in one's memoirs, particularly when one's recent past has\nbeen dominated by an unbroken string of victories.\nHowever, it was a defeat that we suffered against\nSouthampton on Wednesday, 5th March, crushing our hopes of a speedy victory in the League.\nSouthampton proved a devious bunch, primarily\ndue to a committee which prides itself upon its\nskill at subterfuge. It was they who christened I.C.,U. C., and Reading as the 'Big Three' for the title\nthus lulling us into a false sense of security over\nour chances against the remaining 'riff-raff opp osi tion. Much blame for the defeat must thus go to\nthe committee who decided that this would be an\n'easy' match and so we could forego our traditional late night tactics talk plus film at the local\nJacey. As a result we were not able to give our\nplayers the usual information about their opponents (e.g. 'He's from a broken home, hates people\nblowing bassoons while he's putting and gets\nupset if you tread on his balls). Thus our boys\nwere at a disadvantage when they faced Southampton's 'Side of the Century' (i.e. six players).\nUnlike ours, their committee knew exactly what\nthey were up against and had filmed reports prepared on all of our players as well as several back\nnumbers of 'Felix'. This documentary evidence undoubtedly played a crucial role in the subsequent\nvictory they derived. Evidence of this can easily\nbe brought into view when one sees that Mike\nStrickland suffered his first ever defeat in this\nmatch by four and three. In a confidential discussion with the press later he confessed that he was\nsomewhat put off by his opponent's funny walk.\n'How did his opponent know to do a funny walk?'\nI hear you ask. Well, all I know is that in Mike's confidential file it says that he is averse to funny\nwalks and that the last borrower of this file was\na certain Q.E. Too from Southampton, it does not\ntake a genius to see that Q.E. Too is a pseudonym\nfor 'Southampton Golfing Society' and thus we\ncan conclude that the I.C. Golfing Society had been\ninvestigated prior to the match.\nIn the match itself, Bill Calderwood suffered a rare defeat by four and three mainly because he\nfailed to find his usual 'par-busting' form on that\nblustery day. New cap Mick Carr lost his opening\nsingles by one hole after a stirring comeback. He\nwas three down with four to play and pulled back\nthree holes on the trot to tie the match at the\nseventeenth. His loss of the eighteenth hole was\napparently due to a freak blast of wind which carried his ball into un pen et rat able jungle. When I checked this with the Met office they confirmed\nthat such a wind had indeed crossed the course\nat the time. When I enquired as to its likely origin\nI was informed 'Southampton'. Hmm, the plot\nthickens. Chris Cobbledick chalked up another victory for the society by the margin of four and two.\nI gather that he never had to extend himself. Mike\nMarx was recalled to the team for this match but\nunfortunately was opposed by an on-form opponent\nwho defeated him three and two. Mike you will\nrecall gained fame in the Barts match when he\ndefeated the renowned Jim Foster ('Big Brother'\nto the I.C. Captain). This feat alone has earned him\na place in the coveted Society 'Gallery of Stars'.\nThe only other result to record is the victory\nof John Mendonca by five and four. He played\nalmost to par for this match giving his opponent no\nchance. I have heard since that he is an ex-Portu-gue se Youth International; thus his place in the\nteam is unlikely to be in jeopardy for some time.\nSo we lost 4-2; a sad defeat but one to remind\nus that even great teams are fallible.\nTeam:\u2014 Bill Calderwood (Capt.), John Mendonca, Mike Strickland, Chris Cobbledick, Mick\nCarr, Mike Marx.\nHOCKEY\nI.C.2 nd XI 2, Hendon 3rd XI 3.\nBasically the better team on the day won. Hendon had ample opportunities to open the scoring\nin the first half but failed to capital is e on them.\nHalf time came with I.C. leading by 2-0 thanks to\ntwo goals by Tim Feline. However, in the second\nhalf the I.C. performance, with one or two exceptions, became even worse and Hendon soon drew\nlevel. Their winning goal came from a penalty\nflick, which although correctly awarded was\nillegally taken. This was overall a poor performance by an I.C. side capable of much better things.\nI.C.2 nd XI 4, Barnes 3rd XI 1.\nDue to numerous excuses, I.C. could only field\nseven players in this match. However, Barnes lent\nus two players and an enjoyable match ensued.\nAbly led by captain-for-the-day Dave Price (lan\nRead having declined to play as he was suffering\nfrom what is known in horse racing circles as\n\"the cough\"). I.C. and guests emerged as comfortable winners. Within five minutes I.C. opened\nthe scoring with a brilliant goal by Julie (yes, he's still here) Andrews (guess who wrote this re-port?). Two more goals quickly followed both\nscored by one of our guest players. Although\nBarnes did score in the second half a second goal\nby J. A. ensured that I.C. emerged as comfortable\nwinners. After the match, the Barnes players did\ncomplain, with justification, about our lack of play-ers, however, a few drinks in the bar soon calmed\nruffled feelings.\nI.C. MIXED HOCKEY\nREPORT\nDespite fielding a slightly weaker side than usual\n(due to the presence of a first team game at the\nsame time) I.C. defeated Guinness by 3-2. Storming into the attack straight from the bully I.C. came\nclose to scoring on numerous occasions but fine\ngoal keeping by that ex-I.C. star Sid Boulton prevented a goal. In fact it was Guinness who opened\nthe scoring with a well taken goal following a mistake by a certain long-serving member of the\nhockey club who shall remain nameless. The second half started similarly to the first and eventually I.C. equalise d with a fine goal by Andrew Hall.\nA second goal soon followed from Viv Hughes\n(\u2014the sheer pace of the shot deceived Sid). Towards the end of the game lan Read somehow\nmanaged to score (miracles do happen) and Guinness added their second goal in injury time.\nTeam:\u2014 Nigel Harrison; Shirley Fairweather,\nJohn Andrews (O. A.P.); Dave Balderson, Andrew\nHall, Anita Tellam; Geraldine Bowden, Norman\nSayles (appearance courtesy of I.C.U.), lan Read,\nViv Hughes, Sarah Horn.\nIC 1s ts1,v. Presidents XI 5\nAn IC 1st team, very\ndepleted in strength and\nonly able to field 10\nplayers took to the field\nagainst what was to turn\nout to be a very strong\nPresident's XI. Notable\nold faces included Dave\nRichman (captain, las f year's1 sts), Chris Forkclodger, - Pete Bates,\nJulie Sargent (old IC\ncaptain now with Blackheath (who are they?)\nhockey club), and John\nAstley. The president\nhad in point of fact pulled 'a fast one' on IC by\nfielding one of our own\nplayers, Jack Gahir,\nagainst us.\nHaving left the field\nat half-time we later\ntook revenge by feeding\nhim a little too much\nbeer after the match.\nEnjoy the trip home in\nthe van, Jack?\nThe President's XI\nproved to be competent\nin stopping the IC XI's efforts sometimes by unusual means. Perhaps\nthe score line should also\ncredit the President's XI\nwith one cut and blackened eye and cut up\nmouth, produced on\nMick Downs by Julie\nSargent, and another\nbelt across the face of\nTim Hanson by Dave\nRichman. These are acknowledged accidents but\ndid show up the IC\nattack.\nThe one IC goal was\nscored by Nigel Woodhouse from the penalty\nspot after Mick Downs,\ncomplete with swollen\nfeatures, was viciously\ncut down by the goalkeeper whilst measuring\nup the angle to score\nwith. Although the goal\nscore is excessive IC\nheld the opposition well,\nand were only slightly\ndown at half-time. However, the pressure proved too much and their\ngoals came as the result\nof some silly mistakes.\nDave Riicbman got a very\nweak flick past an un-believing defence, and\n(con td. page 7)\n\n"

UC fielded\na strange team\u2014ten men\nand one monkey man.\nUC put IC under some\nearly pressure but were\nonly able to get one or\ntwo shots at goal. IC's midfield started to settle down and took a grip\non Ithe game. After\ntwenty minutes Rob\nHolmes was brought\ndown in the penalty area\nand Mike Jakeman\ncoolly scored from the\nspot. IC had the better\nof the first half but could\nnot create many\nchances.\nThis pattern continued\nin the second half. UC\nwere awarded a free-kick on the edge of the\npenalty area for an off\nthe ball foul and from\nthe resulting free kick\nscored with a shot bent\naround the wall. UC had\nplayed the game as if it\nwas a kicking match and\nIC brought on Sam Hyslop for Rob Holmes.\nMike Jakeman was also\nleft limping by UC's heavy tackles and had\nto leave the field for a short time. Shortly before Ithe end of normal\ntime Mike Butterworth\nwas narrowly wide with\na header.\nThus the game went\non into extra time, which\ndidn't please the spec ta tors, frozen in the arctic\nconditions. UC's hard\ndirty tactics continued\nand two of their players\nwere booked, but the\nmonkey-man escaped.\nIC were now tiring and\nonly had ten fit men.\nThis allowed UC to get\non top and from a free\nkick up popped their\nmonkey-man to put them\ntwo-one op.\nThe referee now warned the cheer leader of\nthe IC kop to stop inducing people to fight but\nstill the monkey man\nescaped punishment. IC\nnow looked a beaten\nteam but got themselves\nback into the game with\nthe best goal of i the match, lan McDermott\nfloated a free kick to the\nfar post, lan Hyslop\nheaded it into the goal-mouth and in the scramble Tony Richards sc or ed. Now IC were on top\nagain but i time ran out\nand the game ended two\napiece\u2014a fair result.\nTeam: Gerwyn Edwards, Chris Anastasi,\nRich Perret, Jim Hey,\nAndy Jackson (Capt.),\nMike Jakeman, Rob\nHolmes, lan McDermott,\nMick Butterworth, Tony\nRichards, Phil Singleton.\nSub.: lan Hyslop.\nPete Davies.\nIC 1st XV St. Edmunds Hall,\nOxford\nIC's invasion of Oxford began at 2.00 p.m. Wilth the four-non-playing\npigs rushing to the nearest pub followed by a half-mi'le pilgrimage to\nan off-licence to obtain\nsustenance for the ensuing match.\nThe IC Iteam contained only nine of the glorious cup-winning team;\nthree f lakers, including\nFlanagan, stood paralytic\non the line. The back\ndivision proved very\nshaky to start with\nalthough 'Teddy's' backs\ndid contain three blues.\nA* constant supply of\nball was won by the IC\nforwards but lit was initially wasted or squandered by the disjointed\n3/4s who incidentally\nhad never played together before.\nThe overall performance in Ithe first half was\nonly sufficient to see IC\nleading by 8 points to 3.\nDuring this time the Oxford backs had done\nexceptionally well with\ntheir ball and the IC\n3/4s had only bothered\nto try after watching\nIthem cruise in for the\n1st try. The second try\nwas an excellently conceived scissors between\nthe Oxford centres which\nwas virtually unstop-p able. After this Peter\nZerbrugge had kicked an\nexcellent penalty to keep\nIC in the game at half-time.\nIC turned round playing up-hill and against\nthe wind but by this time\nthe heavy IC pack were\nin complete control. Excellent line out ball supported by Lipscombe\nand Booth (together with\nloose ball gave much\nimproved backs, led by\nPete, many chances to\nshine. They did more\nthan tolerably well considering the class of the\nopposition and their own\nlack of practice.\nConstant pressure by\nthe pack. Winning three\nconsecutive rub ks gave\nOssie the chance to\ncrash through under the\nposts, even if he did\nhave a two man overlap.\nZerbrugge obliged with\nthe conversion making\nthe score 9-8 to IC. He\nalso dropped a40 yard.\nFive minutes lackadaisical play by IC\nbrought another good try\nby St. E.H. when the\nfull back came into the\nline giving Clement only\nchance to tackle his\nWing on the line. The\nscore was 12-12.\nFrom this point on\nthere was only one team\nin the match. IC dominated in all departments\n\u2014especially forward. A line out ball caught two-handed and held by\nBooth gave Bradley the\nchance Ito go over from\nthe ensuing melee. Zebrugge converted giving\nthe match to IC by 18-12.\nExcellent team play\nwas shown whilst leaving the last pub and I think this was forwarded\nto the Guinness Book of\nRecords.\nTeam: D. Rimmer; G. Clement; D. Osborne;\nM. Cotter; D. Stone; P. Zerbrugge; L. Adams; B. Bradley; J. Hughes; C. Wrigley; S. Booth; K. Lipscombe; A.H. Walton; A. Williams; T.

In spite\nof playing in a red shirt\n(the rest of IC were in\nblue/white) our centre-half Alan Brown displayed phenomenal out-of-position play clearly obvious because of his\nstrange hue.\nBy comparison the\nlater bar social proved\nto be a really excellent\noccasion, and all involved enjoyed the evening\nvery much. Quite a large quantity of beer\nwas drunk and the members of the President's XI who were left at the\nend of the evening did\nnot seem to be in very\ngood condition. (So\nmuch so that they declined to come back to\nSouthside to continue.)\nAs far as IC were concerned all enjoyed the\noccasion even though\nwe regarded ten match\nsomewhat poorly. Our\nthanks are extended to\nour President for umpiring and his \"hospitality\nand good cheer\" after\nthe match.\nAGM The following club officers were duly elected\nat the club AGM held on\nTuesday, 12th March.\nClub Captain, Tim\nHanson; Secretary, John\nAndrews (OAP); Treasurer, lan Read; Fixtures\nSecretary, Graham Popple; Publicity, Andy\nBrewster. It is hoped\nthat the post of Mixed\nFixtures Secretary will\nbe jointly held by a men's representative and\na women's representative. M.D. D, PEDAL CAR BADMINTON IC Section of the Wigan Badminton Club\nGuilds Speed to Victory\n(again)\nEvery year, Bristol\nUniversity, as part of\ntheir rag week, run a National 24 hour pedal\noar race. For those of\nyou unfortunate enough\nnot to i be in Guilds and\nwho consequently have\nprobably never seen a real pedal car, I should\nmention that they are\nbasically larger versions\nof the devices with which\nchildren menace adult\nlegs on pavements. The\nrestrictions are on overall size, reciprocating\ndrive, 1:1 gearing and\nwheel diameter which\ndetermines class. Class\nI cars have small wheels\n(up to 36 cm) and Class\nII cars larger wheels (up\nto 54 cm diameter).\nAs usual Guilds entered two cars, a class I car called Bo Belle, and\na class II car named Big\nBo.\nBo Belle was pedalled\nby Steve Wright, Bob\nCarter, Rich Gunderson,\nTony Raine, Paul Cotter\nand Dave Crook (in arbitrary order) and swept\naway the opposition to\ncapture (the class I award\nby a wide margin (about\n200 laps out of 650).\n-On handicap (a correction to equalise the\neffects of different wheel\ndiameters) Bo Belle\nscraped home to win\nthis award as well.\nAlthough nothing broke this year Big Bo\nfailed to steal the class\nII prize from big wheel\nspecialists Heale's School of Exeter. This is\nprobably due to lack of\nfitness although the fact\nthat three of the team\nhad never pedalled before contributed. However the performance of\nPete Wilkins, Pete Dye,\nDave Rimmer, Bob Carvel!, Dick Bateman, and\nmyself was by no means\ndisgraceful and served\nto put Big Bo about third\nin Class II and helping to\nput Guilds second in the\nteam competition (a prize for best performance of a team of two\ncars).\nMines who occasionally enter a class I car\nsaw Bo Belle in practice\nin Princes Gardens and\nwere frightened off this\nyear leaving Guilds as\nthe sole IC representatives. Scientists in general are too busy demolishing skips with fire\nengines to build pedal\ncars.\nThanks are due to the\nnon pedal ler s who all\nperformed , their tasks\nwith great efficiency\neven when fatigue began\nto tell. They were Penny\nSheppard, Jenny (vote\nfor me) Jones (and Ithey\ndid), and Anne Pickard\nwho cooked, Dave W ll ley and Simon Briscoe\nwho recorded laps and\nPaul Bentley did things\nwith spokes and tubes.\nApologies to anyone I 've\nmissed. Pete Amey.\nAnother superb season by IC has resulted in\nthe firsts remaining unbeaten in four years\nand, once again, winning\ndivision 1 \u2014 closely\nfollowed by the 2nds with their secret wea-pons: Henry and cheat-ing. The 3rds were a trifle unlucky in losing\nthree matches which\nrobbed this motley team\nof 1st place in the 2nd division. Outstanding in\nthis team was Jack (I'm Malaysian) Lee, who actually managed to break\nhis personal record near\nthe end of the season\nand turned up on time.\nPhil (Soul King) Lord\nplayed in his usual impeccable funky style and\nwould have won all the\nmatches himself if the\n\"other lot\" would have\nlet him. The team was\nmost (in)ably captained\nby Brian Callender,\nwhose sequence of\nsmashes into the net in\na single game has never\nbeen equalled.\nOnce again the 4th s, captained by Graham\nDelves, were the most\nwell-organised team and\nonly lost a couple of\ngames.\nTwice a season IC regularly hammer Cambridge Univ. seconds. In\nthe away match the team\nwas a mixed bunch of\n2nds,1 sts and a guest\nplayer: Jean (I'm eli-gi ble) Turner. With a couple of pints of alcohol (before the bet)\nwashing about in their\nstomachs, Keith (short-arse) plus Phil lost their\nfirst game, but Cambridge, lulled into a false\nsense of security, lost\neverything after that (in-clu ding Rice Krispies,\nhamburgers, eggs and a jar of pickles). The\ndrink yourself sick competition after the match\nwas a draw but IC completed their humiliation\nby beating them at bar-billiards. The journey\nback was halted by a short stop at a drinking\nhouse. A hasty escape\nensued, led by Joseph,\nafter Phil \"accidentally\"\ntipped a bottle of sauce\nover a table.\nThe surprise of tha\nseason has been Dave\nWard's \"car\"; it still\nworks! It only needs topping up with water every\nfive miles or so.\nOur mixed team has\ndone well this season,\nand should win the\nleague. Most of the\ncredit must go to Dave\nand Rhod. Dave has\nreally hit form after trying blinkers for the first\ntime, and Rhod's new\nleg-irons made a new\nplayer out of him.\nThanks go to Dave\nWard for the work he\nhas put in as captain for\nthe last two seasons.\nDevised, created anf produced by Keith\nThompson and Phil Lee\n(with only just a tiny\nlittle bit of help).\n\n"
