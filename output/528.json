    "content": "Don't forget....\nIt's Tiddlywinks\nTomorrow morning!\n* Jane Aire\n(see Ents gigs\non next page)\nTHEATRE IN THE WEST END\nAccording to Time Out', West-end theatre\nis half-dead already. Nevertheless, there are\nsome enjoyable shows, and if you've not done\nmuch theatre-going, the West-end is the\nobvious place to start.\nThe following reviews, although brief,\nshould provide a few hints on some of the\nplays currently showing.\n\"The Rocky Horror Show\", which has\nrecently moved to the Comedy Theatre in\nPanton Street, from the Kings Road, is\nprobably the funniest show in London and is\ncertainly the only science-fiction musical.\nDreamed up by Richard O 'Brien, it tells of the\nfateful stormy night when two American\nteenagers, Brad and Janet, are forced to take\nrefuge in an old castle when their car is\nstopped with a flat tyre.The castle turns out to\nbe the home of a colony of Transylvanian\ntransvestites, under the leadership of FrankN-Fuster.\nAlan Ayckbourn's play, \"bedroom Farce\" is\nrunning at the Prince of Wales Theatre. The\n'stage' is set one Saturday night, in the\nbedrooms of the three middle-class suburban\ncouples, as a fourth couple attempt to sort out\ntheir marital problems. Mildly funny: OK for\nan undemanding night out.\nIn its twenty-seventh year (it will probably\ngo on forever) is Agatha Christie's \"The\nMousetrap\". This is not her best play - it is not\nas good as \"Witness for the Prosecution\" for\nexample - and there was some miscasting in\nthe production I saw. However, it compares\nfavourably with \"Murder at the Vicarage\",\nwhich contains the most unconvincing acting\nI 've ever seen. \"The Mousetrap\" is on at the\nSt. Martins Theatre and \"Murder at the\nVicarage\" is at the Fortune.\nWritten in 1970 by Andrew Lloyd Webber\nand Tim Rice, \"Jesus Christ Superstar\" is\nnow in its seventh year at the Palace Theatre.\nIt portrays the last seven days in the life of\nJesus of Nazareth. Its great success resulted\nin the production of an unsuccessful film of\nthe same name. Worth seeing, especially for\nHerod's song.\n(Evita is showing next door, at the Prince\nEdward Theatre. Book now for the new year.)\nSusan Hampshire and Keith Michell are\nappearing in \"The Crucifer of Blood\" at the\nTheatre Royal, Haymarket. Based on Conan\nDoyle's book \"The Sign of Four\", the action\nbegins in India during the Great Mutiny, at the\nRed Fort of Agra, and is concluded in Holmes'\nstudy in Baker Street in 1887.\nThe play has some spectacular special\neffects and Keith Michell's performance as\nSherlock Holmes is superb.\nA more varied selection of plays can be\nseen at the National Theatre on the South\nBank and more unconventional drama is\nproduced by London's many 'fringe' theatres.\nAGAINST THE\nSince I96.7, Britain has had an Abortion Law\nwhich entitles women to obtain abortions,\nproviding certain conditions are fulfilled, op to28 weeks into pregnancy. But a private members bill\ntabled by John Corrie (Conservative member for\nBute and North Aryshire) threatens to change this\nlaw to restrict severely the number of abortions\navailable and the terms under which they may be\nobtain et l. There are l our main areas which the proposed\nbill (which takes its third and final reading in\nFebruary) effect:\n1\n. THe time limit for abortions will be reduced\nfrom 28 to 20 weeks.\nAt present only l \u00b0o of abort ions are carried out\nafter 20 weeks - but these are the most desperate\nand serious cases - making them illegal will only\nincrease the hardship on the women concerned.\nPregnancv is confirmed by about (he eighth\nweek - the new restriction leaves a woman as little\nas eight weeks allowing up to l our weeks error in\nthe dale of conception to obtain an abortion and\nthis at a lime when National Health Services are\nbeing cut:\nThe choice of abortion for all women will\nbecome a desperate race again si I ime.\n2. The grounds tor abortion are to be\nchanged. The risk to the life of a pregnant woman\nwill become a \"grave risk\". The injury to her or her\nfamily'sph vs ical or mental health will be a\" 'substantial risk\" of \"severe injury\" il the\npregnancy continues.\nKmoiive words like '\"grave\", \"substantial\"\nand \"serious\" only aggravate the situ at ion. Courts\nw ill divide what is \"grave\" etc. - women will have\ntheir late decided by judges who have no\nqualifications oxer the lives of these women.\nBut the real reason for these changes is that\nunder the present law any abortion is legal since\nstatistically abortion is safer than a nine-month\npre gn a ne)' and birth. The clause in the I967 Act.\nwhich states that \"abortion is permissible if the\nrisks to the woman is greater than if the pre gn a ne) is continued\", is the most hated by the anti-abort ionis is.' X Every agency which carries out abortions\nor advises women about abortions must have a licence (including those carrying out pregnancy\ntests). Licences will not be issued if there is any\nconnection whether financial or in personnel\nbetween the agency and the abortion clinic or if the CORRIE BILL\nagency is not managed by a qualified doctor or\nnurse.\nThis smashes the British Pregnanes Advisory\nServices and the Pregnancy Advisory Service, the\ntwo biggest charities that carry out abortions.\nTheir work is vital in both filling the gaps in the\nNHS and in areas where NHS abortions are almost\nimpossible to get. They provide a sympathetic\nservice at a reasonable price.\nThe 25% of women who get their abortions\nthrough the charities will be thrown on the\nunscrupulous money makers of the private\nmedicine market.\nVoluntary groups advising for example school\ngirls, about abortions will have to simply give up.\n4. The rights of conscientious objectors to\nabortions who work in the health service will now\nhave legal rights.\nThis means,that doctors will be able to put\ntheir moral views first and the quality of service\nthey provide for their patients second.\nAs can be easily seen the effects of this bill will\nimpose on thousands of Women. We must have the\nright to control our own bodies. There are no\nfoolproof contraceptives. We ma v make mistakes.\nWe may be abused. We will continue to abort:\nCorrie's Bill, anti-abortionists or not.\nDoes Corrie's Bill provide for all the children it\nwill force into this world!? Will it look alter then0 Have we the right to bring children into a world\nwhen we feel we can not look after them - through\nmaterial reasons, social pressures or whatever?\nHaving children is an important decision and we\nwill not let John Corrie deride our fate. We will\nhave the right to control our bodies.\nAt IC then, we must campaign to prevent this\nbill from becoming law. There will be a list, in the\nICWA Lounge, of those MPs who voted against the\nsecond reading. If your MP does not appear, write\nasking why and for re-consideration.\nThere will be a meeting in the ICWA Lounge on\nThursday, ll th October, at 1:00 p.m. with a speaker from the National Abortion Campaign to\ndiscuss the \"campaign against Corrie's Bill\",\nPlease attend, all will be welcome.\nThere will also be a march \"No Return to the\nBackstrcets\" on 28th October, to defend the 1967\nAbortion Act. Assemble 11:30-12:30at Hyde Park.\nMER CHE CLARK.\nICWA President\n\n"

    "content": "LETTERS\nSirs,.\nMay I, through the columns of\nyour esteemed publication counter the pernicious anti-union\nviews of Frank James.\nIn his letter (1st October issue),\nhe viciously attacked our most\nuseful and lively organisations,\nthe CC Us, as being anti-intellectual and detrimental to\nthe academic life of IC. I would, in\nanswer to this, humbly suggest\nthat he totally misunderstands the\npurpose of aC CU,i. e., to promote\nthe academic, social and sporting\nactivities of its members. I have every reason to believe\nthat academic affairs are very well\nlooked after by the CC Us, in a manner which would not be\npossible in the larger and more '\nextensive ICU. Yet Mr. James\nmakes no mention at all of this\naspect of the CC Us. On the sporting and social side,\nhe appears to condemn all\nevents which do not provide direct\nintellectual stimulation and makes what I can only assume are\npurely moral judgements. He\ndoes not know the difference\n(e.g. in the case of \" deciding\" smoking concerts) between\" anti-intellectualism and non intellectualism. Further I would\nadd that such events are, in\nmoderation, essential to the\nacademic and social development\nof the student.\nAbove all, Mr. James censures\nthe CC Us for their rivalry - yet how\nwould he see sporting standards\n(especially) maintained without\nthis rivalry? Does he see\ncompetition as an evil thing? He\nviews the smaller CC Us with\nmistrust and believes they should\nbe \"nationalised into one big\nimpersonal ICU - but would he be\nsatisfied or would he continue\nuntil he had abolished even this in\nfavour of membership solely to\nthe NUS with no variety in union\noutlook and, doubtless, no variety\nin higher education?\nFrank James would do away\nwith the CC Us.NO! They are the\nlifeblood of student activity and\ntheir faults should be made good\nfrom within. You don't fell a good\ntree when a few of its twigs are\nwithered.\nYours faithfully,\nJAMES GRAY Dear Colin,\nI think serious consideration\nshould be given to the abolition of\nFrank James (Letters, Issue no.\n527).\nYours,\nA beer-swilling latent homosexual\nBiochem PG Dear Sir,\nAs is well known, there are a number of publications printed\nby, or contributed to by Imperial\nCollege with the intention of\ninforming intending under-graduates, local residents, industry and the like, k that Imperial College exists, with the\nintention of providing sufficient\ninformation about facilities, life at\nIC and so on , for a choice to be\nmade, or simply to improve\nrelations, as in the case of local\nresidents.\nClearly this can be counterproductive if the information is\nincorrect, so may I suggest that\nCollege block/ICU take a little\nmore care in this area? In case the\nreader doubts the need for this,\nhere is a genuine example: It came\nfrom page III5 of \"Which Degree\n1979\", a page devoted to details of\nlife at IC. Under the heading\nCatering Facilities, it states that\nthere are\n\"a wide choice of College run\nrefectories.. ..between them\nthey provide an all day service\nso aafc r bars, self-service cafeterias and waitress service\nrefectories; most students eat\nlunch there.. ..\"\nOn the subject of Media we find\nthat\n\" Annual Union publications include.. ..a USK handbook\" -talking of which, under the title\nSocieties, we find that there is\napparently a \"University for South Kensington\nmovement.\"\nSince that information was not\neven correct in 1976, it would\nseem that IC may be in an ongoing\ndisinformation situation. Could I therefore suggest that either: IC\nputs out correct information, or:\nUSK is revived and mooney s revamped?\nYours pedantically,\nKen (gone but not finished)\nFenning, Somewhere in England.\nDear Colin,\nI was disgusted to see how\nmany people were packed into\nthe Great Hall for the Rector's reception. If there had been a fire\nalarm, it would have been\nextremely difficult to clear the hall\nin a reasonable time, i.e. before\nsomebody started panicking.\nYours,\nKirsten\nNEWS IN BRIEF\ncompiled from IC Radio News\nCopy deadline for next Friday's issue will be\n5 : 3 0 pm Monday,8 th October Molly Opens Up Shop\nThe South Side Shop is again\nopen for the term. Molly, the\nshop's keeper says it is designed\nto sell necessities to the\noccupants of South Side and\nLinstead. In the past, the shop has proved very convenient to\nresidents by selling anything form\nsoap powder to milk.\nRag's Caped Figure\nThis year's rag symbol, a caped\nfigure in tight clothing holding a rag collection can is to appear on\npint glasses. These will be wold\nduring rag week, later this term.\nThey are expected to sell quickly.\nNew Kitchen Equpment\nNew kitchen equipment worth\nover \u00a31,000 has been installed in\nBernard Sunley House. The\nequipment includes four cookers,\nand ten refrigerators and has been\nadded to the equipment currently\nin use at the House.\nCistern Overflows\nCollege engineers were called in\non Saturday night to Keogh Hall.\nA cistern had overflowed on level\n2 of staircase 6, causing curtains\nin the rooms below to become\nrather wet.\nBedford College Sacks President\nThe President of Bedford College Union, Ruth Fitzjohn, has\nbeen refused re-registration by\nBedford College, and has been\nforced to step down from office.\nThe reason for their refusal was\nthat Miss Fitzjohn had failed to\nsatisfy the examiners in both her\nEnglish session al exam last year\nand the retake two months later.\nBedford' College Union's publicity officer, Dave Brown,\nwho has taken over Miss Fitzjohn's duties as President,\nsaid that they have an agreement\nwith the college that the\nsabbatical post can be held only\nby a person of minimum academic\nstanding, but he regrets that Ruth\nwill not be President next year.\nVictory for Canoe Club\nTwo members of IC Canoe Club\nhave scored an impressive national victory for the second\nyear running. Bob Joce and Bob\nOwen, who were British C2 champions in 1978, have retained\nthe championship by winning the\nLlangollen \"Serpent' Tail\" slalom\nin Wales. The pair finished way\nahead of the rest of the field. They\nare both international paddles\nand British team members. Squash Courts Out of Use\nThe squash courts in k the college sports centre will not be\nable to be used until Christmas.\nThis is due to a fault in the\ndrainage system and the floor will\nhave to be replaced. The opportunity is also being taken to\nrepair the walls at the same time.\nIndustrial Action Diverted\nThe proposed industrial action\nby members of NAL GO threatened registration at many\nBritish Universities this week.\nHowever, the local branch of\nNAL GO decided after a clc sed vote not to take part in the action.\nHad they taken action, many\nmembers of other clerical unions\nin College would have stopped\nwork in sympathy, considerably\nslowing the registration process.\nNational Fun Run\nThe second Sunday Times\nNational Fun Run took place in\nHyde Park on Sunday. Several\nthousand people jogged round\nthe four k il metre long course\nduring the day for the event,\nwhich transformed Hyde Park into\na cross between a cross-country\ncourse and a picnic sit. Following\nthe success of last years Fun Run,\nseveral local newspapers have\nsince organised similar events on\na smaller scale.\nStudent Railcards\nBritish Rail are continuing their\npopular Student Railcard scheme\ninto the new academic year. The\ncard, which now costs eight\npounds, entitles students to half\nprice rail travel on second class\nsingle and Awayday return tickets\nover two pounds and ordinary\nreturns over four pounds in cost.\nStudents may obtain rail cards from most rail stations, but need\nto fill in an application form and\nprovide two passport style photographs. The form and one of\nthe photographs must be\ncountersigned by a tutor and\ns tamed at the college registry\noffice.\nBritish Rail and Lloyd's Bank\nhave joined in a scheme which\noffers 50%, or \u00a34, off the price of a Railcard for all first-year full-time\nstudents who open an account\nwith Lloyd's Bank before 31st October.\nRailcards are also available from\nthe London Student Travel Office\nin the lower lounge of the union\nbuilding.\n\n"

A night of gaiety and lubricated\nrevelry, enjoyed by all. The first RCS Night Out has\nbeen arranged for Tuesday, 9th October, and is a trip to Queens\nIce Skating Rink in Bayswater. It\nwill only cost about a quid. We\nmeet in Stan's Bar in Southside at\n6:30.\nNow we come to one of the\nhighlights of the first term - Yes.\nthe Freshers Dinners. Definitely\nnot to be missed since tickets only\ncost a fiver and you get a good\nmeal, plenty of wine and beer and\nwon\nif you buy a ticket you can go to\nthe Life Sciences Disco, which is\nafter the Life Sciences Party on\n2nd November.\nIf there are any budding wits,\nwags or serious playwrights\ninterested in writing sketches or\nplay lets for the RCS smoking\nconcert could you please leave a note for Rich Archer in the\nChemistry letter rack or drop into\nthe R CSU sometime.\nFinally no mf nations are open\nfor four fresher s entertainments\ncommittee members, so if you want to help organise RCS events put your name up on the\nlists and press-gang second ers into signing.\nDon't forget also to tid d ly wink down Oxford Street tomorrow\nand collect lots of notes (coins\nalso acceptable) to keep RCS Rag\nthe most successful.\nEVE'S SNOTTY ULUweek 8-1*0 w MOIW\niCD NES MTf nr ri TWURSMr 1I.

    "content": "GOOD SOUNDS A TIC THE AUDIO SOCIETY\nAudio Society?\nWJiat do they do?\nYou may well ask; I often do so, when trying\nto dream up things for the committee to\norganise and when attempting to satisfy the\ninsatiable desires of the members. A few years ago we were the hi-fi club, but\nthis was changed probably because \"Audio\nSociety\" sounds more sophisticated A We exist as THE body devoted to hi-fi\nsound reproduction, in whatever form this\nmay take. As such our activities can be\ndivided in to two main areas. Firstly, talks,\nlectures and demonstrations which tend to be\nmainly for the benefit of the members,\nalthough everyone is welcome. Secondly,\nrecordings of music and other entertainments around college, which may\nbe broadcast over IC Radio and hence benefit\neveryone. This latter activity, is a fairly new\none and we are still in the process of getting\nthe necessary equipment together; but the\nfuture looks bright.\nOur lectures are really quite diverse; in the\npast we have had visits from Roger Driscoll,\nan acoustics expert and lecturer, Angus\nMcKenzie, consultant and reviewer, and\nVideo tone demonstrated their newest\nproducts to us.\nOccasionally a tour can be arranged. These\nhave been to places of general inter st, like Dr.\nDriscoll's acoustics laboratory. A few of these\nvisits will be possible this year, details will be\nfound at the end of this article. One of the most promising things to\nhappen recently is our association with the\nAudio Engineering Society. This is a group of\nprofessional people involved with hi-fi who\narrange events similar to our own but with\nrather greater professionalism as a result of\nthe greater resources available to them. Their\nmeetings take place on Tuesday evenings at\nthe Institution of Electrical Engineers, Savoy\nPlace, off the Embankment. We meet and go\nthere as a group.\nNot long ago we had the privilege of\nhearing Peter Walker of QUAD give a lecture\nand demonstration of the new electrostatic\nloudspeaker. Still in the development stage, it\nseems very promising.\nOur society's forthcoming events are\nenvisaged to be as follows:-First Term\nComparison of power amplifiers - the Nairn\nNAP160 versus QUAD405, see if you can\nhear the difference.\nJoint meeting with the Radio Society.\nAnthony Askew who works freelance often\nfor the BBC with their outside broad case unit.\nVideotone will be demonstrating their\nlatest cartridge and hear amplifier. Paul Messenger will be coming up here\nnear the beginning of term. The subject of his\ntalk will soon be announced.\nTony Faulkner is the Recording Manager\nfor Enigma Records. He will be giving a lecture/demonstration on microphone techniques. This very entertaining lecture\nwas presented to the AES earlier this year.\nNear the end of term we plan to have a trip\nto the QUAD factories in Huntingdon,\nCambs.\nSecond Term\nLectures will be given by Dr. Roger Driscoll\nand Angus McKenzie. These were both very\ngood last year and are expected to be even\nbetter this year.\nTrip out to Audio-T. This is a very good hi-fi\nretailer with plenty of facilities for\ndemonstrating equipment. Also lots of good\ntips on pick up/arm/cartridge combinations.\nGale Electronics are setting up a demonstration studio for their products\nwhich include a speaker and a solid glass\nturntable. They are also setting up an\nan echo ic chamber so it might be possible to\narrange to see this.\nLentek have agreed to let us come up and\ntour their factory, again in Huntingdon.\nRogers/Swisstone have a plant in Catford,\nLondon, so we might be able to go there.\nNow you know who we are and what we do\nyou might feel you would like to know more or\nif I have said something which you do not\nunderstand, please feel free to come up and\nmeet us, ask questions or whatever. Our\nmeetings are held on Tuesday evenings at\n7:00 p.m. in ICWA. Failing that you could\ncontact one of the committee which for the\n1979-1980 session is:-JOHN MOR COM, Chairman\nPhysics 2\nJOHN TIDY, Secretary\nPhysics 2\nANDY CRAVEN, Treasurer\nPhysics 2\nJOHN A TH ON LAWRENCE, Publicity Officer\nPhysics 2\nMIKE BIDDULPH, Committee Member\nChemistry 2\nPS\nNon-physicists are just as welcome as\nphysicists - but we still rule, OK? JOHN TIDY\nGOLF CLUB CRISIS\nIn recent years the IC Golf Club has\nenjoyed the pri vele ge of being allowed a block membership at the Royal Mid-Surrey\nGolf Club. However, we have just been\ninformed that they are no longer prepared to\noffer us this facility due to the increased\namount of course usage over the past year.\nThis means that we have been left in a difficult\nposition at the beginning of the college year\nin that we cannot offer fresher s any sort of\nregular facilities until we find another golf\nclub willing to give us a block membership.\nPotential IC golfers should not be\ndiscouraged from applying to join the club,\nhowever, as we hope to be making some\ntemporary arrangements for practise games,\nand have a number of matches which need\nnot be affected.\nIT WOULD BE GREATLY APPRECIATED IF ANYONE WHO KNOWS OF A GOLF CLUB IN OR AROUND LONDON THAT MIGHT BE\nWILLING TO CONSIDER A BLOCK MEMBERSHIP WOULD CONTACT ONE OF THE OFFICIALS BELOW. R.A. Pullen (Physics PG)\nA. Hartnell (Mech. Eng. 3)\nP. Johnston (Civ. Eng. 2)\nSECURITY\nLost Property\nEvery year hundreds of items of personal\nproperty are found and handed in to the\nSecurity Office, many of these items are\nnever claimed by the losers and are\neventually returned to the finders. Students\nand staff who lose property should inform the\nse curt iy staff and in many cases the items can\nbe speedily restored. Persons finding items of\npersonal property should hand them in to\nthe Securtiy Office or to one of the\nmessengers or security guards on ,any of\nmessengers or security guards on any of the\nbuildings.\nThefts\nIt is an unfortunate fact of life that, on an open\ncampus such as this where a large number of\npeople are allowed considerable freedom of\naccess, periodical spates of stealing occur. A good deal of this is due to 'walk in' thieves\nwho prey on institutions such as this. Both\nstudents and staff are requested to cooperate with the security staff by promptly\nreporting to the Security Office any\nsuspicious persons seen loitering in College\nbuildings or entering offices or laboratories\nwith no apparent authority. Wallets, cash,\ncheque books, calculators, slide rules and\nwatches are the things most commonly\nstolen and they should always be carried\nseparately on the person as instances have\noccured where heavy withdrawals of cash\nfrom banks have been made through thieves\nhaving obtained possession of both card and\ncheque book.\nCycles\nPedal cycles are very attractive to thieves and\nif brought onto campus they should be\nsecured to the cycle rack with a heavy chain\nand stout padlock. Plastic covered cables are\nlittle deterrent to thieves and should not be\nused. If you value your cycle please insure it.\nCar Parking\nUnless you have been authorised to park your\ncar on the campus do not bring it into the\nCollege Car Park otherwise you will\ninconvenience some person who has an\nauthorised parking place.\nDerelict vehicles are also from time to time\nan embarrassment to the College and a vehicle which ceases to be road worthy\nshould be disposed of by the owner and not\nleft on the car park where it may quickly be\ncannibal is ed by some persons who are quick\nto recognise that it has been abandoned.\nMotor cycles brought onto the campus must\nbe registered with the Security Office and\nstudents are requested to park only in the\nauthorised parking spaces. Parking in\nbetween motor vehicles can result in damage\nto both cars and motorcycles. A.D. Dawson\nChief Security Officer\n8\n\n"
