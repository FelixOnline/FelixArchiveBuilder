Whatever\nfloats your boat. In an attempt to\nhelp bulk this issue out, in a feature\nthat nobody was asking for, I have\ndecided to write my column for this\nweek only.\nWell that election was a cock-up\nwasn\u2019t it? I can\u2019t believe that the\nentire gamble didn\u2019t work out.\nUKIP didn\u2019t win a single seat! It\u2019s\nalmost as if the entirety of the\ncountry has deemed the party\ncompletely irrelevant. I really\nhonestly thought that the anti-mus-lim rhetoric would resonate with\nthe people of Great Britain, but\napparently the same racism that\nworks across the atlantic, doesn\u2019t\nwork here. Perhaps we need\nto find a new ethnic minority to\nstigmatize \u2013 I\u2019ve heard the Greeks\nare shifty looking. All that hair\nthose people have will make it far\neasier to profile them in airports.\nPlus they break plates wherever\nthey go so you\u2019d be aware of any\nnearby Greeks and could protect\nyour crockery accordingly.\nAfter the disappointment of not\nbeing able to crush more snowflake liberals, I decided to take a\nholiday in order to put my mind\nat ease. Like all patriotic Brits,\nI decided to leave the country\nbecause the weather here is shite.\nI visited the exotic shores of Kavos,\nas it provides the illusion of being\nsomewhere nice, without being too\nfar from a Wetherspoons.\nAlthough there was the opportunity to sample the local cuisine,\nI have a particular aversion to\neating bottom feeding creatures\nserved by equally attractive\nforeigners. I instead spent the\ntime sampling the delights of egg\nand chips in the local Irish pub. I\nreceived uninvited suggestions of\nsome cultural shite to do whilst on\nthe island; however, I\u2019ve been to\nthe British Museum once and since\nwe\u2019ve stolen loads from the whole\nworld, there is no need to see\nanything else.\nOn a serious note I once had\na friend who went to Kavos as a\nvirgin, but when she came back\nshe had had relations with nine\nmen in seven days and came back\nwith chlamydia, so If you do go\nto Kavos be prepared for the last\ndays of Rome on all beaches. Stay\nsafe out there, but stay sexy.\nA\ns you all read\nthis column, you\nwill currently be\nstanding in the\npeople\u2019s republic of\nKensington. Long\nlive Corbyn, long live the red state,\nand death to all Torys. As you can\nprobably tell, I am off my tits on\nsocialist splendour and victory. Like\nmillions of Labour voters, not only\ndo I not understand economics,\nbut I also don\u2019t understand the fact\nthat Labour actually lost. I mean of\ncourse we took the Conservative\nmajority, but we also created a\ncoalition that is possibly so far\nto the right, it makes Marine the\npen look like an advocate of\nmulticulturalism. But still! Fuck Nick\nClegg! The sight of his sad little\neyes made the extensive student\nloan debt that I have acquired feel\na little lighter.\nRiding on the elation of nothing\nsignificant occurring in this elec-tion, I propelled myself into a well\ndeserved vacation from all my\nhard work, sharing articles from\nThe Canary. In many ways, Jezza\nhas a lot to thank me for. Anyway I\ndecided to travel to the untouched\nby white tourists destination of\nBosnia and Herzegovina, having\nonly learnt of its existence from\nEurovision. Upon arriving in\nSarajevo, I quickly bartered with a\nbus driver (using the Yugoslavian I\nhad learnt from Duolingo) to take\nme as far away from anyone that\nspeaks English so that I could get\na truly authentic experience of\nBosnia. Unfortunately it seems as\nthough my 76% fluency on the app\ndid not really translate to actual\nability to speak the language. I\nalso quickly learned that there are\nseveral ISIS cells within Bosnia, a\nMuslim majority country. Frankly\nI was bowled over by the cultural\nappropriation of a country, taking\na religion of peace that is owned\nby brown people and starting\nto practice it, but that is a minor\nquibble. If I had a main complaint,\nit would be the fact I was held\nhostage for a few weeks.\nAfter boarding the bus, I was\ngreeted by an utterly authentic\nBosnian terrorist called An\u0111elko\nwho told me that he would shoot\nme if I tried to run \u2013 the customs\nof Eastern Europe are so exotic!\nI survived on a traditional diet of\nBosnian gruel, which they assured\nme was vegan, which in turn put\nmy worries over the miscellaneous\nbones I found amongst the lumps\nto rest. After a life changing six\nweeks, I was eventually released\nas apparently my family didn\u2019t\nwant to pay any ransom \u2013 what\na bunch of pranksters. I returned\nback to London with new friends\nand new experiences. If any of you\nfeel like getting kidnapped by ISIS,\nI would totally recommend the\nexperience.\nI celebrated the red\nrevolution by going on\na soul-searching trip to\nEastern Europe\nJowen Nones had the best six\nweeks of his life held hostage by\nISIS\nI went to Kavos for\nHolidays in Britain,\nbut with better\nweather\nHaiti Kopkins tells us why immersing one\u2019s self in the native culture\nis a load of shit\nS\nV\n* Sponsored by\nSPA\nTravel\n\n"

Carol is a\n1970s housewife, struggling\nto find reasons to stay in the\nworld. Almost 30 years later,\nin the late 90s, Anna, her\ndaughter, is struggling with\na drug addiction, triggered\nby the loss of her mother.\n30 years later still, we meet\nBonnie, a busy doctor in\nan A&E department, who\nis coping admirably with\nthe stress of her work, but is\nclosed off and distant, famous\nfor not interacting with her\ncolleagues outside work.\nThe three stories unfold\nsimultaneously in front us,\nthe dialogue spilling over\nbetween the three scenes.\nIt should be confusing,\nespecially given the small\nstage of the Royal Court, but\nthe staging is such that each\nstory is clear in its own right\nand carries its own weight.\nThe staging is hauntingly\nbeautiful and one of the\nbest features of the play.\nThe stage is a sparse grey,\nsplit in thirds, one for each\nprotagonist. The supporting\ncast revolve around the three\nwomen, sometimes playing\ndifferent roles and other\ntimes, older versions of the\nsame characters. This gives a\nbeautiful sense of continuity;\nthere is a strong sense that\nwe are watching the same\nstory unfurl whilst affixed to\nthree different axes. Between\nscenes, each of the central\ncharacters is repositioned\nby the people around them.\nStripped and redressed by\nthe supporting cast; they are\nmoved like dolls in their own\nstories.

I\u2019ve ranted for some 28 editions\nnow and you guys have taken it like champs. In\nmy last editorial I\u2019d like to say one final thing\nbefore I fade into irrelevance. I want to talk about\ncomplaining.\nI\u2019m a great complainer. I bitch and moan about\neverything. I quit an online publication I used to do\nsome work for after they asked me to be more positive\nin my online presence (they literally wrote up a whole\nnew social media policy because of me and asked\neveryone to sign it). I told them to shove their positivity\nwhere the sun don\u2019t shine.\nSo yes, I complain. That\u2019s not to say I\u2019m a negative\nperson but I\u2019m certainly no bucket of sunshine. I like to\npick things apart, I enjoy raining on people\u2019s parades,\nand I love ruining moments. You could be telling me\nabout how you\u2019re going to Nepal to build schools and\nI\u2019d say what they really need is roads. I could be sat on\na beach with someone I love telling me this is the best\nday of their life and I\u2019d probably say \u201cit\u2019s somewhere\nin my top 50\u201d back. I could be serenaded by Frank\nOcean and comment on how his shoes don\u2019t match\nhis belt.\nI bitch and moan unapologetically, especially about\nImperial (but like who doesn\u2019t). And as a consequence\nsome people might think I hate it here (which is as true\nas it is about any semi-permanent fixture in my life).\nThe truth though is I really don\u2019t. I might not love it\nlike a fruit that plopped out of my loins (this mental\npicture is really my final gift to you) but I do believe\nit\u2019s a great place. Sure it\u2019s also a terrible place, but\nmostly it\u2019s great. The people here might be a bunch\nof problematic weirdos (just think about the phrase\n\u201cthey\u2019re a bit Imperial\u201d) but they\u2019re also stupidly\nintelligent, hyper-passionate about what they do, and\nremarkable in more ways than my editorial can afford\nto expand on. The institution itself, despite some dark\nfacets of its culture, is cutting-edge and brilliant in\nmany ways.\nI owe a lot of who I am today to my six year love-hate\nrelationship with College. Some of my closest friends\nhave passed through these lecture halls while some of\nthe people I admire most have taught in them. And of\ncourse some of my most memorable boning locations\nare in and around the South Ken campus (including\nwhere you are sitting right now).\nBack to the value of complaining though, perhaps\nthe reason why Imperial is so great is that so many\nof you also can\u2019t stop complaining. Whether it\u2019s the\nreps asking for Panopto, Divest Imperial pushing for\na greener university, Physics tanking their NSS scores\nin protest of a teaching quality they deem sub-par, or\nCouncil often nitpicking the dumbest of things.\nComplaining is the fundamental force propelling\nchange. We\u2019re getting consent training next year,\nhumane library temperatures, and an unstable\ngovernment in the process of exiting the EU because\nsomeone somewhere complained.\nAnd this is what we here at felix do. A lot. The Union,\nCollege, students even will ask us why we don\u2019t report\non all the amazing things happening at Imperial. And\nmy answer is that actually we do, but really that\u2019s not\nour job. We\u2019re not a PR leaflet, we\u2019re not the Reporter,\nand we\u2019re not the Union\u2019s marketing team. What we\u2019re\nhere for is to complain, use our platform to give you\nguys a voice and highlight issues we think are important\nto you. We seldom turn down pieces regardless of\ntheir politics (apart from hate speech obviously) and in\nfact we often try to commission pieces that go against\neverything we believe in.\nMy job is to complain and encourage other people\nto follow suit. It doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s about the Oil and\nGas Industry, curly fries, Theresa May or the library\nair con. Complain, repeatedly and incessantly, and\nyou will be heard.\nSo that\u2019s me this year. Hope we complained enough\nto have given you some permanent eye-damage from\nall the eye-rolling you were probably doing.\nThanks to the amazing editorial team that often\ncarried me. This is all because of you. Many thanks\nto Luke Granger-Brown for being a god amongst\nmortals, to Tessa Davey for adding hours of work to\nmy schedule, to Mattin Mir-Tahmasebi for holding\nthe copy-fort, and Hamish Beck who singlehandedly\ncarried the puzzles section.

In fact,\nthe rainbow flag has been\nflying over Tate Britain\nfor some months now. The\ngallery will be kicking off the\nLondon Pride celebrations\nnext Saturday with a special\nTate Lates at their exhibition\nQueer British Art.\nThe show, focused solely\non LGBTQ+ artists, charts\nthe century or so between\n1861, when the death penalty\nfor sodomy was abolished,\nand 1967, when another bill\ndecriminalised male homosex-uality. The works on display\nthat emerged in this century,\nin which artists ran the risk of\ntrading their freedom for free\nexpression of their desires,\nare a celebration of defiance,\nboth coded and candid.\nThe exhibition encompasses\nart in its traditional forms \u2013\nthere are plenty of paintings\nhere, from John Singer\nSargent\u2019s portrait of Vernon\nLee to David Hockney\u2019s\ntongue in cheek art school\npaintings of oiled up athletes\nfrom the muscle mags \u2013 and\nequally, there are plenty of\nsurprising objects. Amongst\nletters, photographs, voice\nrecordings and masks there\u2019s\na case containing several\nlibrary books, swiped from\nan Islington library in the mid-60s by Kenneth Halliwell and\nJoe Orton. They borrowed\nthe books and returned them\nwith new and improved\ncovers. One (straight laced)\nromance novel called the\nQueen\u2019s Favourite sports a\ncover of two men about to\nhave sex, and The Collected\nPlays of Emlyn Williams are\nretitled Knickers Must Fall and\nFucked by Monty. For every\nfun piece like Noel Coward\u2019s\ndressing gown, for each\njoyful, romantic story like the\none of the painter Duncan\nGrant and the poet and novelist Paul Roche who met at the\ntraffic crossing at Piccadilly\nCircus and were together\nfor 32 years, there are ones\nsharp with tragedy.\nSimeon Solomon\u2019s 1864\npainting of Sappho begins\nthe exhibition, the painting\nIndira Mallik\nQueer British Art (1861-1967) is on at Tate Britain until 1st\nOctober\nTickets: Adult \u00a316.50 (without donation\n\u00a315), Concession \u00a314.50 (without\ndonation \u00a313.10)\nwhich, as per pre-Raphaelite\ntradition, is wispily roman-tic, suffused with flattering\nsoft-focus light, belies the\nheartbreak and injustice that\nbefell the artist; Solomon\nwas arrested for cottaging,\nonce in London, and again in\nParis. He spent the last years\nof his life in a workhouse,\nan alcoholic, abandoned by\nhis friends. In another room\nhangs the lemon yellow\ndoor of the cell in Reading\nGaol in which Oscar Wilde\nwas imprisoned for gross\nindecency.\nSome of the works are\nexplicitly, graphically, queer,\nothers are little more than\nstill lifes \u2013 quiet, unassuming impressionistic works\nwith colourful stories. Ethel\nSands' work, belonging to\nthe aesthetic and impressionistic naturalism movements\npromoted by the famously\nsexually liberal Bloomsbury\ngroup, is characteristic. In the\n1911 painting Tea with Sickert\nwe peep over the shoulder\nof a woman in a fantastically\norange hat, the table is set\nfor tea, Sickert reclines in a\nchintz chair directly opposite.\nThe romantic liaison here\ndoes not involve Sickert as\nmight be assumed, but Sands\nand her lover, the woman in\norange, Nan Hudson. This\nveneer of a particular sort\nof genteel Englishness is replicated in Sand\u2019s The Chintz\nCouch in which she picks out\nthe comfortable interiors of\nher home with Hudson in\nyellow ochre and pale duck\negg blue.\nThe Bloomsbury Group\nwhich included Virginia\nWoolf (here represented\nby a Man Ray photograph)\nand her lover Vita Sackville\nWest (resplendent in a red\nhat in a portrait by William\nStrang) in many ways form\nthe lynchpin. Duncan Grant\u2019s\nimposing Bathing dominates\nthe penultimate room. Its\nmuscular swimmers diving in\nchoppy waters and hauling\nthemselves into boats speaks\nboth of coded desire and the\nyearning to find relief from\nalienation. \u201cHow much I want\nto scream sometimes here\nfor want of being able to say\nsomething I mean,\u201d he wrote\nto John Maynard Keynes, lifelong friend and an occasional\nlover: \u201cIt\u2019s not only that one\u2019s\na sodomite that one has to\nhide but one\u2019s whole philosophy of life\u201d. There is little to tie\ntogether the works in Queer\nBritish Art other than the sex-ualities of the artists involved.\nYet this common thread is\nenough. This is a portrayal of\na community from dozens of\ndifferent angles, distinctive for\nits diversity.\nThe exhibition does well\nto acknowledge that though\ngreat strides have been made\nfor inclusion there is much still\nto be done, even inside the\nLGBTQ+ community which\ncan be just as bound by prejudice as the heteronormative\nworld outside. \u201cI\u2019ve been all\nthe letters of LGBT and hated\nthem all\u201d declares Shon Faye\nin a blistering video installa-tion. Intersectionality within\nthe community with regards\nto race is often lacking, and\nSabah Choudrey, a Pakistani\ntrans activist, draws attention\nto this with his commentary on\nthe theatrical masks created\nby Oliver Messel. Many, he\npoints out, still wear masks of\nassimilation in his community\nto hide their brownness and\ngender identity even when\nthey come out.\nAs we move from decrimi-nalisation to marking other\nmilestones such as the legali-sation of same-sex marriage,\nhopefully the Tate may be\ninspired to curate a new\nshow showcasing queer art\nbeyond 1967. With any luck,\nthey might even include more\nqueer artists of colour.\nEven in its present iteration\nthis exhibition is to be cele-brated. Queer British Art is an\node to artists who have felt\nstrangers in their own cities\nand countries, who despite\nbeing ostracised, demonised,\nand criminalised by the wider\nsociety in which they lived,\nrefused to be silenced, dared\nto love fiercely, chose to counter the hate and suspicion\nwith which they were treated\nwith work brimming with joy\nand sensuality, wit and pas-sion. Theirs is a story worth\nthe telling. As I made my way\naround the exhibition I found\nmyself poring over the stories\nbehind the works just as much\nas over the art on display,\nand in the end, what could be\nbetter than that?\nSappho and Erinna in a Garden at Mytilene (\n1864), by Simeon Solomon \\\\ TATE PURCHASED\n1980\n\n"

But it\nwasn\u2019t. The act of playing is a\nperfectly valid form of artistic\nexpression whether you\u2019re\nshooting ink in Splatoon or\ncomplementing froggits in\nUndertale. This will be a controversial opinion but I think\nthe ending of a videogame\nis as meaningless as the end\nG\naming isn\u2019t\nall fun and\ngames\nperhaps\nironically.\nIn fact\ngamers are often pressed\nfor time, having to juggle\nlife admin and professional\nobligations on top of their\ngaming habit. It\u2019s fair to\nsay we rarely have the time\nto complete many games,\nand if we do, more often\nthan not we\u2019re \u2018rewarded\u2019\nwith really polarising and\nunsatisfying endings. Which\nis why some games are\nso notorious amongst the\nuninitiated: because we can\u2019t\nstop bitching about that\nunsatisfying ending.\nHonestly, an ending\nshouldn\u2019t make or break\nin real life, it\u2019s the journey\nthat matters, not the desti-nation. You\u2019ve sat through\nmost of an engaging story,\nyou\u2019ve immersed yourself in\nthe gameplay and you\u2019ve\nbutton-mashed your way to\nvictory in every boss fight.\nAnd that was fun, that was\nenjoyable. That was the real\ngaming experience, not the\nending. Maybe Mass Effect\n3 totally disregards all your\nprior choices, but at least they\nfelt relevant when you made\nthem.\nBy extension, you shouldn\u2019t\nget so hung up on the games\nyou can\u2019t finish. Real life\ngets busy and can throw all\nsorts of stuff your way. Some\ngames have ridiculously long\nplay times which may or may\nnot be worth the investment.\nAnd besides, there\u2019s so many\nnew titles coming out each\nyear. Some people, some-how, are able to balance\neverything (or maybe playing\ngames is all they do, who\nknows). But it\u2019s fine if you\npersonally can\u2019t entirely complete your ten-part adventure\nseries. There\u2019s decades worth\nof games that you can play\nand enjoy. In the same vein,\nI believe the only reason you\nshould try and unlock every\nachievement is if you really,\nreally love a game and can\u2019t\nbring yourself to stop playing\nit. Why bother slugging your\nway to 100% completion\nwhen you can enjoy so many\nother titles?\nGames are fundamentally\nabout having fun. The idea of\nthinking of the ending as the\nsole reward, something that\u2019s\nmeant to compensate you\nfor the time spent playing,\nseems to kind of imply that\nscore of a friendly game of\nfootball. No one cares who\nwins so long as everyone\u2019s\nhad a good time.\nHaving said all that, I don\u2019t\nmean to detract from the\nimportance of a good story.\nA powerful and engaging storyline in a videogame is what\nmakes the gaming experience\nthat much more unforgetta-ble. Games employ a variety\nof mechanisms to immerse\ntheir audiences in their\nartificial worlds. Some use\nintricate detailed graphics,\nothers create beautiful sound-scapes, but some games\nare able to draw the player\nin simply by the power of\nnarration. A good story can\ncreate a tranquil oasis where\ngamers can for a moment\nbecome the leading charac-ter, swept away in the artifical\ndrama. I\u2019ve always felt this\nway about video games\nand I\u2019m personally pleased\nabout the trend of games\nbecoming more story-driven\nthese days. Let\u2019s look at a\nfavourite, Life is Strange for\nexample. *SPOILER ALERT*\nWhile it nded with a binary\nchoice (only one of which was\nactually good), the story and\nadventure elements were\nmore than enough to make up\nfor the lacklustre finale.\nNo matter what kind of\nThe imperfect ending\nyour thing in which case, you\ndo you). Don\u2019t let an abrupt\nand messy ending ruin an\notherwise superb game for\nyou. Play what you can and\nenjoy things at your own\npace. Whatever the ending\nmay hold, whether you even\nreach it or not, just ride the\ncurrent and see where it takes\nyou. While a perfect ending is\ngreat, a few terrible minutes\ncan\u2019t and shoudn\u2019t take away\nfrom over 30 solid hours of\nimmersive fun.\n\\\\ A powerful and\nengaging storyline\nin a video game\nis what makes the\ngaming experience\nthat much more\nunforgettable \\\\\na game for someone.

The\nshow proved to be a critical\ndarling, charming viewers\nwith its mix of insightfulness,\ncomedy, and genuineness.\nAfter its stellar first season,\nthe series took a one year\nbreak; only recently did it\nreturn to Netflix for a second\nround.\nWe pick up shortly after\nwhere the finale of the last\nseason left off, with Dev in\nthe midst of a pasta-making\napprenticeship in Italy. The\nfirst episode of the season is\na black-and-white homage\nto some of the pillars of\nItalian cinema. In particular,\nthe episode itself takes after\nthe iconic Bicycle Thieves. In\nterms of plot, this episode\nis relatively basic, however,\nits strength comes from its\nstylistic choices and how well\nit establishes Dev\u2019s new status\nquo. In general, this season\nhas a more measured pace\nthan its predecessor, with\nthis more relaxed approach\nmatching the backdrop of\nrural Italy. The first fifth of\nthe series is spent in Italy,\nbefore returning once more to\nNew York, where again Dev\nattempts to piece together\nhis personal and professional\nlives.\nOnce again, Ansari\u2019s\napproach to the series feels\nvery auteur-esque, as each\nepisode has its own unique\nfeel. As before, the episodes\ntend to focus on one topic\neach, whilst still moving\nforward the central plotlines.\nThis time, Ansari casts the net\neven wider, opting to cover\ntopics such as religion, Tinder,\nand sexuality. As the series\nprogresses, there is also a\nMaking a picturesque entrance \\\\ Netflix\ngreater diversification of view\npoints. Much of this season\nfocusses on the experiences\nand struggles of other charac-ters, not just the protagonist\nDev.\nThis comes as little surprise given that Ansari has\nexpressed his exhaustion\nwith the series, indicating\nthere isn\u2019t much more that\nhe has left to say about his\nown perspective. This almost\nvignette-like approach helps\nkeep the series fresh, and\nperhaps offers an avenue\nfor the show to continue in\nfuture. Nowhere is this more\nevident than the season\u2019s\nsixth episode, New York, I\nLove You, which opts to show\nus glimpses into the lives of\na diverse collection of New\nYorkers. The episode is an\nexcellent example of Ansari\u2019s\nwholehearted commitment\nto representation. In a single\nepisode we\u2019re taken through\nthe homes of Manhattan\u2019s\nelite and the people who\nwork for them, we\u2019re treated\nto a beautiful silent segment\nthat gives us a peak into the\nlives of deaf protagonists,\nand we\u2019re taken for a ride\nin the cabs of New York\u2019s\nmigrant taxi drivers. All\nthese themes are masterfully\nexpanded and brought back\ntogether as the episode ends.\nThese diversions, one could\nargue, are more powerful\nthan Dev\u2019s story over the\nseason. His main narrative\narc over the season is a\ntypical, albeit well-executed,\nromance plot-line. It even\nends with a slightly clich\u00e9,\nalthough again quite apt,\nGraduA\nd\nm\ni\nr\ni\nn\ng\nt\nh\ne\nv\ni\ne\nw\ns\n\\\n\\\nN\ne\nt\nf\nl\ni\nx\nate-style conclusion. This\nis contrast to, for example,\nthe powerful Thanksgiving\nepisode, which deals with\nDev\u2019s friend Denise, who\u2019s\nstruggling to be accepted as\na lesbian by her family.\nAnsari\u2019s humour shines\nas bright as ever, and on\nthe whole actually sees a\nmarked improvement since\nlast season. Some of his more\nexaggerated mannerisms and\njokes are downplayed, which\n\\\\ Once again,\nAnsari\u2019s approach\nto the series feels\nvery auteur-esque,\nas each episode\nhas its own unique\nfeel \\\\\nmakes Dev\u2019s interactions feel\na lot more real. Of course,\nthere are still some cheesy\nmoments at points, but these\ndo not detract from the\nnarrative. The performances\nthroughout the season are\nexcellent, with new introductions capably matching up\nto old favourites. As usual,\nhowever, it is Aziz\u2019s father\nwho provides some of the\nstand-out segments of the\nshow.\nA great strength of the\nseries has always been its\nsoundtrack, and that is a\ntrend that continues here.\nIt deftly blends together\neverything from Tupac to 60s\nbaroque-pop in a way that\naccentuates the setting\nand mood of a scene.\nIn many ways,\nMaster of None\nfeels like a\nmodern-day\nOn the Road.\nIt excellently\ncodifies much of\nthe aimless and\nwistful wandering\npeople experience\nthrough their 20s\nand 30s, and it offers\nsober if optimistic looks\nat many of the issues of our\ntime. It is sure to go down as\none of the year\u2019s, if not the\ndecade\u2019s, best shows.\n\\\\ Ansari has\nexpressed his\nexhaustion with the\nseries, indicating\nthere isn\u2019t much\nmore he has left to\nsay about his own\nperspective \\\\\n\n"

Kate, the provider of Rucksacks accommoda-tion, greeted us as we sleepily\ngot off the bus. Luckily Braemar was the end of the line, as\notherwise we might\u2019ve missed\nit!\nChecking the weather\nforecast we were pleasantly\nsurprised. We seemed to be\nincredibly fortunate to have\narrived in the Cairngorms\nduring one of its very few\nsunny weeks of the year.\nWith the good news having\nput a spring in our step, we\nslowly climbed our first hill,\nMorrone (859m). It was a\npleasant albeit sleepy hike\nand we spotted the famous\nblack grouse as a bonus, so\nhey. Returning to Rucksacks\nwe made some lovely tomato\nand vegetable pasta for\ndinner, perfect for another\nday of fellwandering.\nThe next day we caught up\non some sleep, starting our\nwalk at 10am and headed\ntowards the Munro, Lochnagar (1155m). There was so\nmuch sun we got sunburnt. In\nAberdeen. I know.\nNow we had to decide\nwhich route to take back to\nBraemar. Awkwardly, the\nriver Dee does not have a\nbridge in Braemar which\nforced us to spend about an\nhour walking on the road on\nthe way back. It wasn\u2019t too\nbad since the sun was still\nshining and the view was still\nquite picturesque.\nDay three was even more\neventful to put it mildly.\nThe lack of a bridge in\nBraemar proved to be quite\nan issue. To get around it we\nfound a section of the river\nwhich was shallow enough\nfor us to cross. We cautiously\nwalked across the fast-flowing\nfreezing water with our bare\nfeet on the slippery riverbed\nstones, with the sun still\nburning bright. Only three of\nus made it across as Hardeep\nwasn\u2019t particularly keen on\nwalking in cold water. Hardeep insisted we go on without\nhim, and so we did (sorry).\nWe walked along quite\na long track with a steady\nincline (not steep enough to\nget left behind). The sun was\ninsane and the landscape was\nfull of dry red little bushes.\nI couldn\u2019t believe we were\nin Scotland \u2013 it was like the\nplane we took from Gatwick\nwent south instead of north.\nWith quite a strong pace it\nwasn\u2019t long until we summited\nthe south top (1177m). It\u2019s\nweird when the sun is shining\nyet you find yourself treading\nthrough snow.\nOn the way back we didn\u2019t\nmanage to get to the river\ncrossing before dark because\nwe managed to miss the path.\nThis meant having to contour\naround the steep slope with\nthose red bushes scraping our\nlegs. Arguably it wasn\u2019t the\nbest terrain for walking and\nwe were all relieved when\nwe completed the descent\ndown to the river. Eventually\nwe were faced with a dreary\n8km walk on a desolate\nroad in the dark, with only\none torch between us. Our\nspirits were low as it was late\n(9pm) and we had run out of\nfood. We tried running but it\ndidn\u2019t last long. Luckily a car\napproached and we were\ndelighted when we found out\nthat it was two Irish mountain\nrescue chaps! They drove us\nall the way back to the Co-op\nin Braemar which we made\nit to just before closing time\nto pick up ready meals and\npizza. We were not up for\ncooking after that 42km walk!\nThe fourth day was a rest\nday as after a quite some\neventful days the group\ndecided to take it a little\neasier. I began the day with a\ntraditional Scottish breakfast including lorne square\nsausage and black pudding.\nThe others weren\u2019t interested\nin such delicacies. Obviously\nonly the enlightened amongst\nus shovel grease down their\nthroat for enjoyment.\nThe others decided to\nstretch their legs and so\nThe fellwanderers have grown hairier since the last time I saw\nthem \\\\ Hardeep Singh\n\\\\ Only three of\nus made it across\nas Hardeep wasn\u2019t\naccustomed to\nwalking in cold\nwater \\\\\n\\\\ We were\nincredibly fortunate\nto have arrived in\nthe Cairngorms\nduring one of its\nvery few sunny\nweeks of the\nyear \\\\\nTalk about a view! \\\\ Hardeep Singh\nclimbed the local hill Creag\nChoinnich (538m). The route\nwas part of a permanent\norientating course though we\nwere too tired from previous\ndays to complete it. A quick\nascent to the top gave us a\nfine view of Braemar and the\nsurrounding hills. Martin was\nalso interested in the difference between Caledonian\nand alp pine trees, the former\nlooking far more impressive,\nthough other group members\ndidn\u2019t see the nuance. We\nthen went back for Lunch.\nBefore sunset, Martin ran\nup Morrone(859m) while\nHardeep hid in the bushes,\ncapturing some amazing\nshots of a herd of red deer!\nHardeep also returned\nfrom another village called\nBallater, \u201cknocked off the\nbucket list\u201d and we ate a tasty\nvegetable curry dinner. In\nthe evening, we completed a\n500 piece puzzle of Europe\n(on the eve of the article 50\ntrigger), though the map was\nmany years out of date\u2026\nThe next day Hardeep left\nto continue exciting travels\nacross much of Scotland.\nMartin and Ollie were given\na lift to the Lin of the Dee by\nKate to continue exploring,\nThey took the long way to the\nentrance of the Lairig Ghru\nand Corrour bothy. They\nclimbed up to the Devil\u2019s Point\n(completely cloudy/misty at\nlast) and then tried to get to\nCairn Toul but retreated at\nStob Coire an t-Saighdeir due\nto the icy conditions resulting\nfrom a total white-out in some\nareas. On the way back, a\nnegotiation concluded with\none Oreo every 2km on\nthe road to keep spirits up.\nWe had dinner (cheese and\ntomato sauce pasta) and\nslept. On the final day we\nflew from Aberdeen to Luton.\nFellwanderers out.\nEmma McCracken\n\n"

Blah.Blah.Blah\nfelixonline.co. uk /comment comment.felix@ic.ac.uk\nAbuse is\nnot a valid\ncomment\nTessa Davey doesn't appreciate people\nmaking derogatory comments about\nthe work of student volunteers\nI\n've been writing and\nediting Comment for\nfelix for years, and it\u2019s\nmy strongly held opinion\nthat a student newspaper\nwithout opinion is not a\nstudent newspaper worth\nhaving. University is a time\nwhen we\u2019re all growing up,\nfinding ourselves and forming\nour beliefs, and a huge part of\nthis process is a lot of active\nconsideration of everything\nwe thought we knew. Trust me,\nI've really been dragging this\nprocess out: I've been here for\nnearly a decade.\nI write Comment in pursuit of\nwider discussion. I'm open to\nhaving my opinions changed\n\u2013 as has happened many times\n\u2013 and I'm equally happy for\nsomeone to form an opposite\nview to mine. I choose to write\nabout things that are worthy\nof discussion, regardless of\nanyone\u2019s take on them.\nI've run the Comment section\nof felix such that no one would\never be personally targeted.\nRegardless of whether an\narticle was about someone\u2019s\nactions or in response to\ntheir ideas, I firmly believe\nthat it should not be a\npersonal attack. Anyone can\nwrite Comment \u2013 the only\nqualification you need is to\nhave an opinion \u2013 but as a\ngood Comment writer, you\noften write in a deliberately\ninflammatory way, making\nyour opinions seem far more\ncontroversial than they are.\nAfter all, no one wants to read\ntheir own bland views echoed\nthousands of times around\ncampus.\nAs a result of this, a lot of\nmy articles are commented\non, and I'm often sent emails\nor challenged to discussion.\nI welcome this: engagement\nwith the ideas is my aim. I\ndon\u2019t write from a narcissistic\ndesire to see my name in print,\nor because I think I have the\nultimate final say on a topic.\nHowever, until this year,\nI\u2019d never felt that it was me\npersonally being attacked,\nonly the opinions that I\u2019d put on\npaper. If I made typos or did\na poor job of editing, it didn't\nreally have any impact on the\nway the content was received,\nbecause the production of felix\nis not expected to be the same\nas a mainstream newspaper.\nPointing out typos has always\nbeen fun, of course, but in all\nmy years at Imperial I've never\nseen it used as an argument to\ndegrade the content until this\nyear.\nI, like many others, give up\nhuge amounts of time to make\nsure that felix is run smoothly\nand all submitted content from\nstudents is developed such that\nit can be brought to fruition in\nprint. Along with dozens of\nother volunteers and a full time\neditor (whose working hours,\nyear on year, regularly exceed\n60 or 70 or 80 hours a week)\nI spend many, many hours in\na basement poring over style\nguides and InDesign files, fact-checking and editing content.\nIt's never perfect, but that\ndoesn\u2019t matter. I'm incredibly\nproud of every article that\ngoes to print, whether it's the\nMusic section, Sport, or Clubs\nand Societies; whether it was\nwritten by me, someone I\nknow, or someone I\u2019ve never\nheard of.\nI have put my heart and soul\ninto felix for years, and I am\nincredibly protective of the\npaper and the people who\ndedicate their time to making\nit. I absolutely condemn\nanyone who does not respect\nthe work this takes, and who\ndismisses and degrades the\ncontent that we \u2013 untrained\nvolunteers \u2013 create for the\nstudent body, whether they\ndo so as part of a personal\nvendetta or a superiority\ncomplex manifesting as a lack\nof empathy and disregard for\nthe very real humans who are\nbehind the words.\nSadly, this is what has\nhappened this year, and\nthrough various media I\nfeel that as a result of my\nassociation with felix, I, along\nwith others, am being unfairly\ncriticised, attacked, and\ndragged into petty arguments\nthat I have no involvement in.\nThis is abhorrent and I cast\nincredibly strong aspersions\non anyone who thinks that\nit is appropriate to (without\nevidence) attack the many\nfor fear of directly criticising\nthe few. A fear that, perhaps,\npersonal struggles that formed\nthose articles. Frankly, that is\nrude and uncalled for.\nThe felix office has become\nmy home and the people\ninvolved have become\nmy family. Contrary to\npopular belief, we\u2019re not an\necho chamber. We\u2019re an\nopinionated, argumentative\ngroup with a vast array of\nexperiences, ideas, and\npolitical affiliations. I'm\nproud to have been involved\nwith felix for so long, and to\nhave had the opportunity\nto have been shaped by my\ninteractions with hundreds\nof people who are brought\ntogether by a mutual respect\nand a desire to create and\nshare ideas.\nYears of editing Comment\nhave trained me to respect\nall opinions and to consider\nthings from a neutral\nperspective. I believe that\nopinion can change the\nworld, but unwarranted and\nunconstructive hate is not a\nvalid opinion. It is a personal\nattack, and it is not something\nthat I will fail to condemn in\nmy student newspaper nor\nelsewhere at my university. By\nall means, I would encourage\neveryone to raise any concerns\nin an appropriate and\nrespectful way, but it is never\nappropriate to use a grudge\nas an excuse to make malicious\nattacks on uninvolved students.\nI hope whoever takes up the\ntorch at felix next year feels\nthe same way, so that we can\nhave an engaging dialogue\nwhile ensuring that discussions\ndon\u2019t needlessly deteriorate\ninto unprovoked attacks.\ncould be well justified, if vague\nunsubstantiated insults are the\nthe only critique that can be\nprovided.\nSome of our articles are\nincredibly well written, and\ntake a lot of work. This year we\nhad three articles shortlisted\nfor the Student Publication\nAssociation Awards \u2013\nincluding two of mine \u2013 while\none of our members was\nshortlisted for Best Reporter.\nThis while competing against\nthousands of entries from\nstudents all over the country.\nMost of these students study\nJournalism or English and are\ntrained to structure and colour\ntheir writing, training that we\ndo not have. Our success is\na huge achievement that I\nam immensely proud of. For\nme personally, writing and\nlater preparing one of my\nshortlisted articles for entry\nwas extremely traumatic and\nI am indebted to the rest of\nthe felix team for supporting\nme through the process that I\nput myself through because it\nwas an incredibly important\nstory to tell. To generically\ndenigrate our achievements is\nto diminish the work of many\nwho worked hard on their\nentries and is to dismiss the\noften powerful stories and\n\\\\ I have put my heart and soul\ninto felix for years, and I am\nincredibly protective of the paper\nand the people who dedicate\ntheir time to making it \\\\\n\\\\ I absolutely\ncondemn anyone\nwho dismisses and\ndegrades the content\nthat we \u2013 untrained\nvolunteers \u2013 create for\nthe student body \\\\\n\\\\ It is never\nappropriate to use a\ngrudge as an excuse\nto make malicious\nattacks \\\\\n\n"

I felt as though\nI could tell him anything and I\nthought he felt the same way\nwhich is why to this day it\nmakes no sense to me why on\nthe 3rd\nof March, 2015, he fell\nfrom our bedroom window\nwhilst I was having breakfast.\nTo clarify, the coroner\u2019s\nreport stated that there was\nnot sufficient evidence to conclusively say it was suicide,\nbut I have thought about the\nevents of that day, every day\nfor the past three years, and\nI cannot think of any other\nexplanation. I also found a\nnote on his desk suggesting\nthese thoughts, although\nit must be stated that this\nhandwriting could not be confirmed to be 100% his. It\u2019s not\ndifficult to find the reports \u2013 I\noccasionally google his name\nto see if there is anything else\nwritten about him, and I know\nI\u2019m mentioned in an article\nsomewhere in relation to it.\nAfter the ambulance\ncame, the police spoke to\nme to make sure I had no\ninvolvement in his death. I\nwalked to classes because I\ncouldn\u2019t stay in that building\nany longer. I remember just a\nsense of complete numbness\nthat didn\u2019t stop until the\nevening when we had a hall\nmeeting \u2013 where I cried for\nhours. I spent much of that\nday trying to think of the best\npositive outcome. His injuries\nwould be serious, but maybe\nhe would survive.\nThe following day I went\nto St Mary\u2019s hospital to see\nhim in the Intensive Care\nUnit where I met his family\nfor the first time. I waited in\nthe waiting area for a few\nminutes before his father\ncame out and explained to\nme with slow and considered\nwords that Georg would\nnever be the same again, and\nthat the brain injuries he had\nsustained were life changing.\nI went in to see him. Both his\nlegs were in casts, he was\nbreathing through a ventila-tor, he had more tubes going\ninto him than I could count,\nand his face was unrecog-nisable from the fall. I said\ngoodbye to him and left the\nhospital to phone my parents,\nwho I hadn\u2019t said anything to.\nI burst into tears once again,\nand my mum said she would\ncome to pick me up and take\nme home.\nHe died a few days later on\nthe 7th\nof March whilst I was\nat home trying to block the\nwhole event out of my head,\nand I returned back to halls\nto be told by his grieving\nparents and brother. I don\u2019t\nreally remember much from\nthat time until I went to Berlin\nfor a week for his funeral. I\ncan never thank his parents\nenough for the kindness and\nhospitality that they gave\nme in the darkest time of\ntheir lives, but guilt lingered\nthroughout that entire trip,\nand to an extent it still does.\nDespite me confessing this to\nso many people, there is still\nthe idea at the back of my\nmind that I could have done\nmore. I could have noticed\nearlier. I could have told him\nabout my depression. Maybe\nhe would have opened up\nto me and we could have\nworked through it together.\nMaybe it was nothing related\nto mental illness at all. A\nmillion maybes come up when\nI think about that year, but not\nenough answers.\nI still maintain a friendship with his parents and\nhis brother, partially out of\na sense of duty, but mostly\nbecause I genuinely really\nlike them. I had the strangest\nthought this year that I have\nknown them longer than I\never knew Georg, and yet it\nstill feels like he is the one that\nI am trying to make this up to.\nWhenever I go to Berlin I take\nthe tram to the outskirts of\ntown and visit his grave, and\nwhilst it is odd to be 21 and\nvisiting graves of people I\nonce knew, I will forever have\nthis sense of duty towards\nhim. I talk occasionally to\nhis brother and parents and\nexchange holiday greetings;\nhowever, sometimes I think\nperhaps I am a chapter of\ntheir lives they would rather\nforget. If that is the case, then\nI wish them no ill will and will\nalways be thankful for their\npatience.\nRecently I lost my wallet\nwhich had a passport photo\nof him inside, and when I lost\nit, it felt that perhaps it was\ntime that I stopped grieving\nfor him. To stop grieving is not\nto forget, but to live your life\nwithout their death impinging\non your life. I miss him every-day, but he made a decision\nthat can not be changed. For\nmonths afterwards I tried to\nconsole myself with thoughts\nsuch him dying young, meant\nthat he would never have to\nsee anyone close to him die,\nthat he would never have to\ngo through anymore pain,\nbut as I reflect back on those\nideas, they seem false.\nIf you ever feel like life is\nnot worth living, take time\nout. Go back home. Seek\nhelp from other people. If\nyou ever feel like you are\ntoo stressed and upset to\ncontinue, talk to someone,\ntake a year out, university\ncan always wait. If you ever\nfeel like you have nobody to\ntalk to, I can guarantee there\nis always someone out there\nwho would rather listen to\nyou cry than have to go to\nyour funeral.\nGeorg was 20 years old,\nhe had a passion and a talent\nfor computing, and he was\nmy friend whom I miss every\nday.\nIf you\u2019re struggling with\ndepression and need someone to talk to, you can reach\nsupport on the Samaritans\u2019\nhelpline 116 123\n\\\\ I found a\nnote on his desk\nsuggesting these\nthoughts \\\\\n\\\\ I felt as though\nI could tell him\nanything and I\nthought he felt the\nsame way \\\\\n\\\\ A million\nmaybes come up\nwhen I think about\nthat year, but not\nenough answers \\\\\n\n"

Almost\n300 people turned up to\nhear the legendary Professor\nNutt, author of Drugs Without\nthe Hot Air and one of the\nmost important figures in\nBritish science. PSI couldn\u2019t\nhave chosen a better person\nto kick off their series of\nevents \u2014 Professor Nutt\nis as entertaining as he is\nintellectually fascinating.\nNutt is a powerful speaker\nand starts his talk with the bold\nstatement that psychedelic\nconsumption by the ancient\nGreeks made them feel much\nbetter and allowed them to get\non with the important tasks of\ninventing democracy, writing\nplays, and \u201cbasically founding\nWestern society\u201d.\nPullingtheaudienceintomore\nrecent times, Nutt pinpoints\nthe major breakthrough in\nthe field of psychedelics:\nAlbert Hoffman\u2019s synthesis\nof LSD for the first time in\n1938. He claims this indirectly\nrevolutionised life sciences:\nthe development of PCR was\nreportedly the result of an LSD\ntrip in which Kary Mullis saw a\nDNA double helix unravelling\nand replicating.\nNutt has tried to espouse\nthe benefits of psychedelics\nin psychiatry and help people\ngive up smoking and alcohol.\nHe admits that there are\nrisks of adverse reactions\nbut explains that when taken\nunder adequate supervision,\nresults are \u201coverwhelmingly\npositive, safe, and effective.\u201d\nNutt proves his point by\nexplaining the findings from\nmore recent research, much\nof it his own. Psilocybin (the\npsychoactive substance\nfound in magic mushrooms)\ndrasticallyimprovedthelivesof\npeople with severe treatment-resistant depression. What\nis truly astonishing however\nis his explanation of how the\ndrug works. Depression is\ntypically treated with selective\nserotonin re-uptake inhibitors,\nwhich \u201cdampen\u201d activity in\nthe amygdala (the part of the\nbrain responsible for fear,\nwhich is commonly over-active\nin depression). Psychedelics\nseem to do the exact opposite.\nNutt\u2019s theory is that increasing\namygdala activity helps\npeople confront their emotions\nrather than suppress them.\nHe recounts a moving tale of\none subject who managed\nto confront their abusive\nfather for the first time after\npsychedelic treatment.\nBut what about the more well\nknown effects of psychedelics?\nNutt thinks he can explain\ntrips too. His functional MRI\ntests show decreased activity\nin brain regions associated\nwith integration in volunteers\ninjected with psilocybin.\nHe suggests that this allows\npeople to see the \u201cprimary\nprocessing\u201d that occurs in\nthe brain. He believes that\nthis is responsible for the\nhallucinations and \u201cegodisintegration\u201d during trips.\nIn future work he hopes to\ndiscover \u201cwhere people go\u201d\nafter taking psychedelics\nand is confident that at some\npoint scientists will be able to\nvisualise what users see by\n\u2018reading\u2019 their brain waves.\nBy this point the audience is\nwell and truly on Nutt\u2019s side\nand certain of the immense\npotential of psychedelics. So\nwhy isn\u2019t the rest ofthe scientific\ncommunity clamouring for\nmore research? The answer\nlies in politics and what Nutt\nrefers to as possibly the\ngreatest scientific censorship\nsince the days of Copernicus\nand Galileo.\nIn 1966 the CIA was deeply\nconcerned about the \u201cdrop\nacid, not bombs\u201d mentality\nof young people and their\nreluctance to fight in the\nVietnam War. Nutt speaks\ndeeply critically of the media\ncampaigns that ran headlines\nsuch as \u201cLSD made me a\nprostitute\u201d and \u201cDoctors\nblame LSD/Girl gives birth to\na frog\u201d which helped get LSD\nbanned and classified in the\nUK as a class A drug. He was\neven more incensed in 2005\nwhen psilocybin was made\na class A drug. Nutt blames\nthis on the Daily Mail, which\nhe accuses of pushing Tony\nBlair to take a more \u201cmacho\u201d\nstance on drugs. He even goes\nso far as to declare that this\naction was illegal since the\nappropriate experts were only\nconsulted two days before the\nvote. It wasn\u2019t all bad though\n\u2014 Nutt muses that the move\nprobably provoked him into\ndoing psychedelics research.\nCriminalising psychedelics\n\\\\ Nutt has tried to\nespouse the benefits\nof psychedelics in\npsychiatry and help\npeople give up\nsmoking and\nalcohol \\\\\nhas undoubtedly made\nresearch much more difficult\nand expensive. Nutt claims\nthe drugs are treated as\n\u201cmore dangerous than\nplutonium\u201d. He ridicules the\ninexorable bureaucracy\nthat means he can write a\nprescription for heroin but\nmust undergo a police check\nand constant supervision to\nensure he doesn\u2019t slip out a\nlittle psilocybin. There has\nnever been a death caused\nby psilocybin, he claims, but\nplenty of people die from the\nalcoholism that the drug could\nhelp treat.\nIt is impossible to listen\nto Professor Nutt without\nbecoming convinced\nof the benefits of\npsychedelic research and\ndecriminalisation. He thinks\nit\u2019s finally time for a rational\nand enlightened approach to\ndrugs policy. He hopes that\npolitical and public debate will\nlead to the decriminalisation of\ncannabis and then psilocybin.\nAnd if LSD is decriminalised in\nNutt\u2019s lifetime? He\u2019ll take it as\nhe dies.\nIn April, brains of people on LSD, ketamine or psilocybin were observed to be in a \u201chigher state of\nconsciousness\u201d // Betshy Sanchez\n\\\\ In 1966 the\nCIA was deeply\nconcerned about\nthe \u201cdrop acid, not\nbombs\u201d mentality of\nyoung people and\ntheir reluctance to\nfight in the Vietnam\nWar \\\\\n\n"

Each year,\ntens of thousands of works\nare submitted to the Summer\nExhibition, not only from\nestablished artists but also\nfrom amateurs and students.\nThese are then whittled down\nto the 1100 works ultimately\ndisplayed on the walls of\nthe Royal Academy by the\nHanging Committee, this year\nheaded by Eileen Cooper.\nCooper has made it her\nmission to widen the scope of\nthe Exhibition by making an\neffort to showcase the work\nof artists from a diverse range\nof backgrounds in education,\nrace and nationality. This is\na necessary and admirable\ngoal, but her ideals were a\nlittle undermined by her tour\nof the works to the press. She\nmoved from one piece to the\nnext, detailing her connection\nto the respective artists; one,\nwe learnt, was a student, the\nother a mentor, the next, a\ndear friend from her days at\nCentral St Martin\u2019s \u2013 so much\nfor meritocracy.\nRegrettable though it is,\nthat the Exhibition for all its\ndreams of openness should\nfall prey to the entrenched\nethos of the \u2018old boys\u2019\nnetwork\u2019 is somewhat to be\nexpected. Royal Academicians, the artists elected as\nmembers of the Royal Academy, including Tracey Emin\nand Norman Ackroyd, expect\nto be exhibited at the institution\u2019s headline show. We may\nas exhibition-goers be missing\nout on the work of some\npromising unknown artists,\nbut everything has its bene-fits. The Summer Exhibitions\ncan often be a good way to\n\u2018catch up\u2019 with the big names\nwithout committing to a solo\nexhibition of their work.\nThese are rarely radical\nnew directions of work, but\nsolid examples in the vein\nof an artist\u2019s greatest hits.\nEmin\u2019s pieces this year are a\nseries of handwritten phrases\nIndira Mallik\nThe RA launches a surprisingly\nemotive edition of its trademark\nsummer show.\nSummer Exhibition 2017 is on at the Royal Academy of Arts\nuntil 20th August\nTickets \u00a315.50 (without donation \u00a314)\nConcessions available.\nAssorted works at the The Summer Exhibition \\\\\nIndira Mallik\nconstructed in neon lettering.\n\u201cAnd I said I love you!\u201d\nproclaims one; confession or\nrebuke? We\u2019re never quite\nsure; the ambiguity is part of\nthe charm, making the private\nand personal public has\nalways been at the centre of\nEmin\u2019s work. In another room,\nMichael Craig-Martin\u2019s flat,\nvibrant illustrations of household objects return \u2013 a tennis\nracquet rendered in jewel\ntones, in another instance\na violin; each a cheery,\ntwo-dimensional equivalent\nof Duchamp\u2019s ready-mades \u2013\nprecise and bright.\nDifferent coordinators take\nresponsibility for the curation\nof different spaces. One of\nthe standout rooms belongs\nto Yinka Shonibare. His walls\nare painted in sumptuous\nburnt orange; the colour\nof the best kind of tomato\nsoup, the colour of slow\nburning embers. Against this\nstriking backdrop Shonibare\nhas hung some of the most\nvibrant, memorable works of\nthe exhibition. His own Venus\nde\u2019Medici stands in a corner,\na traditional Venus cast\ncovered in yellow and red\nAfrican textile, her head a\npainted geographical globe.\nMore than any other room\nShonibare\u2019s is international,\nwith a focus on portraits, one\nfilled with humanity. There are\nsome fantastic large works; a\ncanvas of the Henna Bikers by\nHassan Hajjaj dominates on\none side, and in the centre,\ntwo thrones assembled by\nGon\u00e7alo Mabunda in an\nAfro-tribal style from flattened bullets and grenades\nand other weapons of war\nhold court.\nLess imposing in size but\nno less bold in artistry are\nTaigen, Monika, Larry,\nDasha, Rosie, and Kadeem\nand Kyrone, denizens of\nLondon\u2019s East End recreated\nin wonderfully intricate\npainted wooden sculptures\nby Tomoaki Suzuki. They're\nbrimming with energy and\nlife, mixing modernity of\ncharacter with the deeply\ntraditional craft.\nThere\u2019s always a lot to take\nin at the Summer Exhibition,\nworks are crammed in Tetrisstyle, frame upon frame,\nsometimes five or six works\nhigh; smaller works tend to\nget a little lost. The print room\ncan often be a source of\nhidden treasures: Ackroyd\u2019s\nunassuming monochrome\nprints of cliffs and seascapes\nare always a delight, and a\ndelicate oil of a Pale Green\nHydrangea by Melanie Miller\nis tucked away in a corner \u2013\nit\u2019s worth seeking it out for its\nmeticulous brushwork and use\nof muted tones in the tradition\nof the Old Masters. Worth\nseeing too is the architecture\nroom in which a host of construction diagrams toe the line\nbetween technical illustrations\nand works of geometric art.\nThe undisputed highlight of\nthe show is the video installation WESTERN UNION: Small\nBoats by Turner-nominated\nIssac Julien, who is this year\u2019s\nWollaston Award winner. A\nhaunting narrative of wealth,\ndecline, and migration plays\nout over five screens; a big\nwhite house stands by the\nSicilian coast, well-to-do families sun themselves amongst\nthe rocks surrounding it,\nsome lean, tanned men dive\ngracefully into the impossibly\nblue waters. We see a close\nup of some sandy toes, as\nthe camera pans away we\nsee they belong not to a sun-bather, but a body covered\nin metallic foil, one figure in a\nrow of many. Scenes of decadence are interrupted by ones\nof tragedy \u2013 men, sapped\nof all their energy, are cast\nadrift on small boats, others\ndrown in the waters that\nonly moments ago looked so\npeaceful. Julien completed\nthis work in 2007 but it has\nnever before been exhibited.\nA decade on, the images of\nstark inequality are more relevant than ever. The opulent\ninteriors of the Royal Academy lend an extra dimension\nto the work, immersing us\nfurther in the world that Julien\nhas constructed.\nThe Summer Exhibition is\noften like a good summer\nblockbuster: frequently action\npacked, high on sugary froth\nbut light on emotional reso-nance. Julien and Mabunda\u2019s\nwork shows that this art world\nsummer fixture can be much\nmore.\n\n"

It had\nbeen exactly a week since\nthe horrific scenes at the\nManchester Arena, and a\nfew scant days before more\nhorrific scenes would play\nout barely two miles from the\nKing\u2019s Cross venue at London\nBridge. \u201cAin\u2019t religious faith\nthat\u2019s causing these crimes/\nIt\u2019s losing faith in democratic\nfree market designs\u201d\nhe continued: \u201cthere\u2019s a\nmonopoly on pens that\u2019s\nwhy they forge their own\nswords\u2026They\u2019re misguided,\nturned violent, strapped\nthemselves up with bombs/\nBut they\u2019re still cowards,\n\u2018cause they ain\u2019t here when\nthe backlash is on.\u201d Many\nartists understandably felt the\nneed to say something after\nthese attacks, coming from\nAhmed it feels particularly\npoignant. He along with the\nrapper Heems, the other half\nof Swet Shop Boys, has made\na career of creating politically\nconscious music that doesn\u2019t\nshy away from tackling issues\nof religion and race.\nRiz Ahmed (a.k.a. Ric\nMC) of Rogue One fame, is\na Muslim British Pakistani,\nHeems (previously of Das\nRacist) is American Indian,\nand Hindu. In Swet Shop\nBoys, the two complement\neach other as they trade bars\nover the tabla and shehnai-heavy classical Indian\ninspired beats produced\nby Redinho.

Riz\nby contrast, is lightning\nfast. Spitting bars that draw\ninspiration from the grime\nscene of his London youth,\nhe brings a self-aware academic tone, going as far as\nto invoke Virgil and Homer\nas a defence in a case for\nShop Boys have shown they\ncan be light-hearted and yet\nstill be powerful, in Cashmere,\nin a track named after the\n(erstwhile) One Direction star,\nRiz addresses boys like his\nnephew, praying they won\u2019t\nbe radicalised by the \u201chating\nand the news and all the shit\nthey sanitize\u201d \u2013 \u201clook Zayn\nMalik\u2019s got more than eighty\nvirgins on him/There\u2019s more\nthan one direction to get to\nparadise\u201d.\nGenerations of kids growing\nup not sure of their place in\nthe world have found a voice\nthat speaks to and for them in\nrap and grime.

    "content": "Friday 16 June 2017 5\nfelix.news@ic.ac.uk felixonline.co.uk/news\nfelix\nN E W S\nSport to be reshuffled next year\nJames Cox tells us what he\u2019s got in store for Sport at Imperial Abigail de Bruin\nS\nince about\nJanuary, there\nhave been\nrumblings in the\nUnion of a big\nsports shake-up.\nWe got in touch with James\nCox, current Deputy President\n(Clubs and Societies) to see\nwhat\u2019s happening now that\nthings are pretty much ready\nto be openly discussed. It\nappears we are set to go\ninto a full year of student\nconsultation and decision-making regarding some very\nbig changes in how Imperial\nCollege Union and Sport\nImperial will work together to\naccommodate student sport.\nAccordingtoCox,bythestart\nof the 2018 academic year\nclub sport will be delivered\nunder one banner in one\nplace on campus. \u201cThis aims\nto solve the root cause of a\nlarge proportion of our issues\nsurrounding sport at Imperial,\nnamely communication\nand transparency over\ndecisions and the complexity\nof processes,\u201d he says.\n\u201cThroughout next year, there\nwill be a transitional process\nto achieve this\u201d\nThe history of the relationship\nbetween Sport Imperial,\nImperial College Union, and\nstudent sport societies has\ncertainly been a rocky one.\nThe Varsity incident, and\nsubsequent research into our\ninstitutional culture, have\nhighlighted inherent sexist\nstructures. There has also\nbeen a variety of issues with\ntransparency around certain\nprocesses, including funding\nand facilities, seeing many\nstudents frustrated by the\nlack of clarity. As Cox says,\n\u201canyone involved in sports\u2019\ncommittees understands that\nrunning their club can be a\nchallenge under the current\nstructure; tackling this is one of\nthe reasons I ran for DPCS in\nthe first place.\u201d\nThe Union recently sent out\na survey to students to gauge\ntheir experience with Sport\nImperial. The comments that\npoured in have not exactly\npainted the best picture of the\norganisation.\n\u201cSport Imperial have\nconsistently made me feel like\nmy team or sport was not a\npriority, by failing to provide\nbasicprovisionssuchaspitches\nfor matches, failing to provide\nsufficient information, and by\nrunning campaigns that have\nbeen offensive and unhelpful\nto the cause of encouraging\nand uplifting women in sport,\u201d\nsays one exasperated survey\nparticipant who wants to\nremain anonymous.\nThat\u2019s not to say Imperial\nCollege Union has been\nfaultless in this partnership. A\nwhole host of issues have come\nup over the years as a result\nof Union action (or inaction)\nincluding double booking of\ntraining spaces and repeated\nissues revolving around the\nUnion Gym floor coming apart\nor the splintering in the Union\nDining Hall (although we are\ntold the floor is finally due to\nbe replaced soon).\nNow, the Union is finally\nworking with Sport Imperial\nand will hopefully adopt\na multifaceted approach\nthat will enhance the sport\nexperience at Imperial. \u201cSport\nImperial (College) and the\nUnion (me, Activities) have\nbeen on the same page for\nquite some time,\u201d says Cox.\n\u201cAll parties involved are\nincredibly passionate about\nachieving the best for the\nstudents regarding sport and\nit is very reassuring to work\ntogether with that in mind! We\nhave worked very closely on\nmany decisions surrounding\nsport this year.\u201d\nAs far as restructures are\nconcerned, Cox has been\nlooking for solutions in other\nstudent unions. A trip to Bath\nin March yielded particular\ninsights. Though it\u2019s a common\noccurrence for other student\nunions to have athletics unions,\nwhere sports and societies are\nsplit Cox doesn\u2019t think this is a\nsystem fit for Imperial. Instead\nhe\u2019s pushing for a more\nstudent-led system.\nIndeed, Imperial is renowned\nfor the breadth of student-led activities it provides.\nOther Universities tend to\nhave fewer clubs with wider\nscopes of activities, but Cox\nreassures us that we won\u2019t see\nthe merging of clubs to reduce\nadministration burdens. \u201cTo\nthrust an extra five teams\ninto one club for one student\nto run would be silly in terms\nof managing people and\nfinances,\u201d says Cox. \u201cBesides,\nthis would completely\ndisregard the years of history\nand tradition we have built\nat Imperial. Imperial doesn\u2019t\nhave a tendency to copy\nothers, we\u2019ll create something\nourselves and it will be better.\u201d\nSo what\u2019s next? Obviously a\nkey difficulty with the projects\nof Officer Trustees is that for\nthem to be completed, they\noften have to be picked up by\nthe incoming officer. Only time\nwill tell how effective the vitally\nimportant student consultation\npart of this project will be.\nBut Cox doesn\u2019t think that\u2019s\nnecessarily enough. \u201cTo make\nthis a success, all students\nneed to get involved with\nconsultations next year when\nthey come, so stay on the ball\n(yep, intended). If it [the new\nsystem] is created by students\nand for students, it will be\nheralded by all students, don\u2019t\nunderestimate this [sic].\u201d\n\\\\ According to\nCox, by the start of\nthe 2018 academic\nyear club sport will\nbe delivered under\none banner in one\nplace on campusr \\\\\n\\\\ Though it\u2019s a\ncommon occurrence\nfor other student\nunions to have\nathletics unions,\nwhere sports and\nsocieties are split,\nCox doesn\u2019t think\nthis is a system fit for\nImperial \\\\\nCollege gets collection points for\nGrenfell Tower fire victims\nLef Apostolakis\nGrenfell Tower on Wednesday\nafternoon visible from Holland\nAvenue, still smoking // felix\nF\nollowing the fire\nthat engulfed\nGrenfell Tower in\nthe early hours\nlast Wednesday,\nclaiming 17 lives\nand injuring many more,\nsome critically, Imperial\nCollege set up clothes and\nbedding donation points at\nthe main entrance to the South\nKensington campus and in\nWhite City at the Grdpad\nWood Lane Studios.\nA statement released on\nImperial\u2019s website wrote:\n\u201dOur thoughts are with those\naffected by the fire at Grenfell\nTower.

Next up was\nMetro Exodus, in which the\npost-apocalyptic wasteland\nseems to be even better than\nin previous titles; the preview\nfollowed and its cargo is\nstolen; the cargo turning out\nto be another supercar. It\nseems fun and over-the-top,\nand will be released on the\n10th\nNovember.\nBy far the highlight of their\npress conference however,\nwas A Way Out, a game\nfrom the developers behind\nBrothers: A Tale of Two Sons.\nIt is an exclusively co-op\ngame, to be enjoyed either\non the couch or online,\nwhere two players must work\ntogether to escape a prison.\nThe two players\u2019 actions are\nindependent of each other\nand both need to heavily\ncooperate in order to make\nit to safety. Overall this one\nseems particularly exciting,\nand is definitely one to watch\nout for as it releases in 2018.\nFinally, EA ended with\nthe smallest of teases for\nBioware\u2019s new IP, Anthem,\nwhich received a much more\nsubstantial reveal the following day at Microsoft\u2019s press\nconference.\nThe press conference was\ngreat and opened with, as\nexpected, a large focus on\nMicrosoft\u2019s new console, officially named the Xbox One\nX. The console is advertised\nas the most powerful console\never created, and will be\nreleased in early November\nfor \u00a3450.\nThey then focused on\nsoftware, showing off 42\ngames. First up was Forza\nshowed footage of the player\nhunting down mutated beasts,\nbefore finally jumping on a\nsteam locomotive to safety.\nEveryone was then treated\nto the worldwide premi\u00e8re of\nAssassin\u2019s Creed Origins. The\nlatest game in the series is set\nin ancient Egypt, which looks\nphenomenal by the way, and\nthe hero Bayek was shown\nriding through his hometown\nand assassinating one of his\ntargets. The preview revealed\nnew light RPG elements\nwhere Bayek levels up and\ngains ability points, as well\nas sporting an eagle which\nhelps him scout out enemy\nencampments.\nMicrosoft had a few more\nreveals, including PlayerUnknown\u2019s Battlegrounds, State\nof Decay 2, Minecraft in 4K\nand DragonBall FighterZ.\nThey then proceeded to an\nextended look at Sea of\nThieves, Rare\u2019s open-world\npirate game, which featured\ntreasure hunting, riddle\nsolving and a large-scale\nnaval battle in the middle of a\nmassive storm. It was arguably the highlight of the show;\nthe colour scheme is bright\nand vibrant and the gameplay looks incredibly fun.\nCuphead and Crackdown 3\nE3 2017 | Follow up\n\\\\ A big surprise\nannouncement\ncame in the form\nof Shadow of the\nColossus, a remake\nof the beloved PS2\nclassic \\\\\nT\nhis past week E3\nwas in full swing,\nwith all the largest\ngame companies\nholding press\nconferences to\nshowcase their newest games\nand consoles. While this\nyear was more subdued than\nprevious years, especially\ncompared to the phenomenal\nexpos of 2015 and 2016, it\nwas still a very fun event and\nhad a few welcome surprises.\nFirst up was EA, who didn\u2019t\nquite start E3 off with the\nbang we all hoped for. They\nfirst focused on their sports\ngames; NBA Live 18, Madden\n18 and Fifa 18, with the latter\nmonopolising our interest as\nit\u2019s set to get an official Switch\nrelease. EA also showed a\n\\\\ Official GDC\nfinally received release dates\nof September and November respectively, and were\nfollowed by a length demo of\nMiddle-earth: Shadow of War\nand the reveal of Ori and the\nWill of the Wisps. They then\nannounced that original Xbox\ngames are being added to\nbackwards compatibility, and\nthen closed their show with\nthe big reveal of Bioware\u2019s\nnew IP, Anthem. It is a game\nfeaturing high-tech exosuits\nknown as Javelins, with\nwhich players can brave the\n\\\\ Microsoft\u2019s press\nconference was\ngreat \\\\\ndemo for Need for Speed\nPayback. In it we witnessed\na heist in which a truck is\nwilderness, exploring and\nkilling the enemies they came\nacross. It looks like a great\nmix between a shooter and\nopen-world exploration, similar to Destiny, and is slated\nfor 2018.\nNext up was Bethesda\nwho frankly had the least\ninteresting showing this year.\nThe only new reveals were\nSkyrim and Fallout 4 in VR,\nfollowed by The Evil Within 2\nand Wolfenstein II, with the\nlatter two games revealing\nsome great trailers.\nUbisoft was next,\nsurprisingly having a phenomenal press conference.\nThey started with the reveal\nof Mario + Rabbids: Kingdom Battle, which is a very\ninteresting SRPG exclusive\nto the Switch. It features\nturn-based strategy combat\nas well as simple open-world\nexploration, and releases on\n29th\nAugust. It also allowed\nMiyamoto to make one of\nhis trademark entrances,\nwhich was incredibly fun. The\ndirector of the game was also\nvisibly emotional, which made\nthe presentation that much\nmore heartfelt.\nThe Crew 2 was showcased\nnext which showed off several\ndifferent vehicles to race in,\nand Skull and Bones, a game\nbased exclusively around\n3v3 pirate naval battles.\nThey also had an extended\ndemo of Far Cry 5 where they\nrevealed Boomer, your dog\ncompanion.\nFinally came their big\nannouncement: Beyond Good\nand Evil 2, 15 years after the\noriginal game was released.\nIt acts as a prequel and the\ntrailer was phenomenal.\nIt depicted the setting and\ncharacters incredibly well,\nand hinted at some gameplay mechanics. Very little\nis known about it as of yet,\nmore promising this time.\nThe gameplay seemed fun\nand the number of zombies\non-screen was impressive,\nbut the zombie animals,\nsuch as the zombie bear that\nended the demo, gave it an\nextra dimension. Monster\nHunter World was the next\nannouncement placing the\nmassive series back on a\nSony home console. With\nimpressive graphics and new\nfeatures such as camouflage\nand taking cover, it seems like\nit\u2019s the natural evolution of the\nfranchise.\nA big surprise announcement came in the form of\nShadow of the Colossus, a\nremake of the beloved PS2\nclassic which is lauded as\none of the greatest games\never made. Then a few PSVR\ngames were shown off,\nbefore moving onto God of\nWar, where an extended\ntrailer showed off the bond\nbetween Kratos and his son\nArtreus, as well as the new\nover-the-shoulder action\ngameplay.\nAfter that was time to tease\nDavid Cage\u2019s new game\nDetroit: Become Human, with\na pair of androids attempting to \u2018awaken\u2019 their fellow\nandroids and rebel against\ntheir human masters. As with\nthe first trailer, there seem to\nbe multiple different outcomes\ndepending on the options\nchosen.\nFinally, to close off their\nshow, Sony showed off\nInsomniac\u2019s Spider-Man,\nwhich received an extended\ngameplay demo. The game\u2019s\ntaken many cues from Rocksteady\u2019s phenomenal Batman\nArkham series. The stealth\nand combat were incredibly\nsimilar, though it has action\nset pieces with QTEs and\nquips galore, like Uncharted.\nThe exploration and gameplay seem great, and it is set\nfor a 2018 release.\nFinally, we were treated\nto the Nintendo Spotlight,\na short 30 minute video\nwhich showcased many new\nupcoming Switch games.\nFirst, Rocket League was\nconfirmed to be coming to the\nSwitch with exclusive items\nand cross-platform play, in\n2017. Xenoblade Chronicles 2\nthen revealed a trailer which\nshared story details and basic\nthough the internet is buzzing\nwith speculation.\nSony\u2019s press conference\nthis year unfortunately, didn\u2019t\nmeet the high expectations of\ntheir previous two years, but it\nwas still a good showing over-all. They lead with Uncharted:\nThe Lost Legacy, which seems\nvery similar to previous\ngames in the franchise. The\nwitty banter and over-the-top action set pieces are still\nhere, only this time with Chloe\nand Nadine heading the\nadventure.\nNext up was a demo of\nDays Gone, which seemed\n\\\\ The two biggest\nNintendo reveals\nwere Metroid 4\nand a new \u2018core\nPok\u00e9mon game\u2019 \\\\\nFrom the streets of Victorian London to the tombs of Ancient Eygpt \\\\ Ubisoft\nYour friendly neighbourhood Spider-Man swings back into action \\\\ Insomniac Games\ngameplay, though it should\nbe said that the English voice\nacting so far seems abysmal.\nHopefully this will be rectified\nbefore its release.\nNew unnamed Kirby and\nYoshi Switch games were also\nteased, with simple trailers\nthat demonstrated the 2.5D\nplatforming and co-op func-tionality; both are coming out\nin 2018.\nThe two biggest Nintendo\nreveals were Metroid Prime\n4 and a new \u201ccore Pok\u00e9mon\ngame\u201d for the Switch, which\nfans have been clamour-ing since the Switch was\nannounced, though nothing\nmore was said. The Zelda\nDLCs received some more\ninformation, with the second\nDLC pack focusing on the four\nChampions and Zelda. And\nfinally, Super Mario Odyssey\nended the Spotlight with a\nphenomenal showing. New\nhat powers will allow Mario\nto possess enemies, NPCs and\ninanimate objects and control\nthem for an amount of time. A\nfew new worlds were shown\nas well as some sections featuring old-school 2D Mario\nsections, akin to Zelda: A Link\nBetween Worlds\u2019 painting\nmechanics. Odyssey releases\nin October 2017.\nAll in all, though not the\nbest we\u2019ve seen, this E3 didn\u2019t\ndisappoint. There were many\nsurprise announcements\nthough some were noticeably\nmissing, such info on The Last\nof Us Part II and on Nintendo\u2019s online service. Still what\nwe got was good, and many\nof the announced games look\nvery promising indeed.\n\n"

Imagine: turning up to\nthe door of a launch event to\nknow that my name had never\nbeen added to the guest\nlist. Or wandering around a\nparty, hand sweating holding\na glass of champagne, not\nknowing anyone there and\nno-one knowing who I am.\nOh oh oh! Receiving the bill\nfrom a poker-faced waitress\nto find that supposedly\ncomplimentary tasting costed\nmore than two weeks of my\nallowance.\nSomething I\u2019ve missed from\nthis double life is being able\nto visit restaurants without all\nthe pressure of getting the\nbest photos, the best seat in\nthe house, the best flat-lay\nshot under the most perfect\nnatural light, or even having\nto chose who to take with me\non the basis of nice hands\nand a good appetite (you\nknow, someone to finish the\nfood AND volunteer as a\nhand model). While receiving\ninvites to new restaurants\nis something I\u2019m very, very\ngrateful for, and something\nthat definitely helped me get\nout of my comfort zone, I still\nwant to be able to grasp the\nfreedom to explore the food\nscene outside of my own\npersonal tastes.\nSo last week I decided\nto pop down to the newly\nopened XU for lunch on\nmy own. XU is a Taiwanese\nrestaurant created by the\namazing people behind\nBAO which in turn is known\nfor its minimalist, artistic kick\nand its creative baos and\nTaiwanese snacks. Its vibe has\nbeen impossible to replicate\nin the London food scene.\nXU retains that artsy flair but\nwith a twist. Walking into\nthe two-story restaurant on\nRupert Street is like walking\nonto the set of a period film;\nthe wooden fans swirling on\nthe ceiling, the pink chairs,\nthe wooden framed bar \u2013\nthat classy, opulent interior\nreminiscent of the 1920s.\n\u201cAll I need right now is a\nQipao\u201d, I think as I stare\nblankly at the waiter in his\nblack suit and bow tie, my\nhands stroking the creases\nof my rather modern white\nblouse.\nI am seated on the first floor,\nat a table tucked in the back\n\\\\ The mains take\nme by surprise \u2013 the\nportion sizes are far\nmore generous than\nI expected \\\\\nbeautiful addition to the London\nwith one chair, conveniently\ndesigned for lone diners like\nmyself. Not long after that, I\nam presented with a menu.\nBAO is known for its creative,\ntea-based drinks, and they\nexplore their mixological\ncombinations even further\nat XU with a whole range of\ncreations, including XU\u2019s Gin\n& Tonic, a gin infused with\ntea leaves. Naturally, I think\n2 pm is not at all early for a\ndrink, so I go for a Lo Tsui Ke,\na sweet mix of Hong Yu Tea,\nGin, white miso and apple.\nI\u2019ve done my research thoroughly before coming, and\norder the lunch menu which\npleasantly provides me with a\ntaster of a few dishes without\nbreaking the bank. It includes\na snack, a choice of starters,\none main plus a bowl of rice\nand greens.\nThe lotus chips arrive as\na snack. Thin slices of lotus\nroot are fried and seasoned\nwith chilli, peanut and winter\nmelon syrup. The crunchy\ntexture and the savoury\nsweetness of this dish make\nThe starters arrive next.\nI went for the tomato and\nsmoked eel out of the three\noptions available in the lunch\nmenu. Cubes of tender fish\nare mixed with juicy tomato\nchunks, all in an appetising\nvinegary, spicy dressing.\nI also order the taro\ndumplings as an extra. Three\nplump, glossy pyramids sat\non a pool of green kow choi\noil dressing, with a chunk of\niconic sweet and salty Taiwanese sausage wrapped inside\nchewy taro skin. They\u2019re\ndelicious.\nThe mains take me by\nsurprise \u2013 the portion sizes\nare far more generous than\nI expected. A whole portion\nof their signature Shou Pa\nChicken arrive with a dish of\nseasonal greens (my favourite\nChoi Sum) and a bowl of\nsteamed Chi Shiang rice.\nThe waitress kindly explains\nit the perfect bar snack \u2013 I\u2019d\nhappily return to the bar for\na few cocktails over a few\nbowls of these.\nthe Shou Pa Chicken: marinated chicken with ginger\nand spring onion with a white\npepper and chicken skin dip.\nI am advised to give the bowl\na gentle mix before diving in.\nThe drippings and sauce coat\nthe tender strips of meat, with\nthe ginger and spring onion\ntying all the flavours together.\nThis dish goes perfectly with\nthe rice \u2013 the flavours and\nsimplicity of this dish transporting me back to my home\nin Hong Kong. it feels oh so\nfamiliar and oh so homey.\nHalfway through the\nShow Pa Chicken and I and\nabsolutely stuffed. Luckily the\nwaiter offers me a special da\nbao \u2013 my Chinese roots just\nwon\u2019t accept any food wast-age. (My mother would have\nslapped me for not finishing\nthe rice.)\nVerdict. Absolutely delicious\nfood, sincere service, wonderful to see the BAO family\nexpand so successfully. I\u2019d\ndefinitely come back again\nfor lunch \u2013 I\u2019m eyeing their\nsignature Bak Kwa (meat\njerky) and Char Siu Iberico\nPork!\nfood scene\n\\\\ BAO is known\nfor its creative,\ntea-based drinks,\nand they explore\ntheir mixological\ncombinations even\nfurther at XU with\na whole range of\ncreations \\\\\nAndrada\u2019s trans-European culinary summer\nAre you dying to leave London? Are you getting on the\nfirst bus, train, plane, boat, submarine out of this country\nfirst chance you get? Are 90% of your choices motivated\nby hunger? Andrada Balmez will be your guide through\nSouthern Europe (and also Poland for some reason). Take\nher hand (and some cutlery and eat your summer away!\nB\nelieve it or not,\nthis is the last food\ntip of the year \u2013\nand it makes me\nfeel both sad and\nrelieved. Because\nthere is no dish that\u2019s really\ngood enough to celebrate the\nend of the year, the promise\nof summer and freedom, I\ndecided to create the perfect\ntrans-European food itinerary\nfor you.\nIf you have the time and\nmoney to travel a little bit I\nhighly recommend it, if for\nno other reason, just to get\nrid of all that exam stress\n(if you had any, of course).\nThough realistically none of\nyou will actually embark on\nAndrada\u2019s culinary adventure\nacross Europe, if you do\ntravel I do advise you to make\nthe best out of it and eat\nsomething you are unlikely to\nfind in London. Like affordable housing or something I\ndon\u2019t know.\nFirst stop, Italy. Admittedly,\nItaly is a lovely summer\ndestination and while Rome\nmight be one of the more\npopular pit stops, it is far from\nmy favourite. If you happen\nto pass through, try not to\nmiss the Quinto quarto \u2013 just\nbecause Rome is the home of\nthis dish \u2013 and if la pajata is\na bit too much for you (I will\nadmit that intestines served\nwith tomato based sauce and\nrigatoni is not for everyone),\nyou should definitely try coda\nalla vaccinara! For renaissance geeks I recommend\nbistecca alla fiorentina \u2013 a\nrenowned beefsteak found in\nFlorence \u2013 totally delicious.\nMy favourite thing about\nItaly is that no matter where\nyou go you will find a wine,\ncheese, steak and dessert\nspecific to the location you\u2019ll\nfind yourself in. So keep an\neye out for those rare local\ndelicacies!\nMy next stop is France. And\nFrance is pretty damn nice if\nyou avoid the big cities, with\ntheir boiling hot temperatures\nand hoardes of tourists. Feel\nfree to ignore my advice if\nyou\u2019re feeling great and want\nto fight with legions of tourists\nfor the best picture with the\nMona Lisa, or for a waiter\u2019s\nattention in a restaurant. If\nyou\u2019re not up for that, try a\nnice small village and sample\nsome local food. French\nlocal delicacies are great,\neverywhere, or at least,\neverywhere I went. I know\nyou know to try the famous\nRatatouille, the foie gras, truf-fles,and cheese and wine. Try\nto refrain from binge drinking\nfine wines to drown the pain\nthat comes with failing your\nexams. Unless you need the\nextra tipple to feel brave and\ntry some escargots! The name\nmight sound scary/fancy, but\nthey are only snails. They are\nworth trying at least once,\nand, if you\u2019re still feeling it,\ntry some quenelles \u2013 they\u2019re\njust dumplings, promise..\nBecause you probably want\nto spend your summer in a\nnice sunny warm place \u2013\ndefinitely not because I have\n\\\\ If you feel like\nhaving the blood\nof a suckling pig or\nlamb on your hands,\ngo to Segovia\nand try Cochinillo\nasado \\\\\nno idea about what people\nin Nordic countries eat \u2013 let\u2019s\nmove on to Spain. If you feel\nlike having the blood of a\nsuckling pig or lamb on your\nhands, go to Segovia and\ntry Cochinillo asado (I\u2019ve\nheard that they also have\nsome nice\u2026 art (?) landmarks\n(?) cultural events (?) worth\nseeing, but don\u2019t quote me,\nI just care about the food).\nEven if your trip does not\ninclude this destination, it\u2019s\nwell worth the detour! If you\nlove seafood, don\u2019t hesitate\nto order some gambas al\najillo \u2013 and this comes from\nsomeone who is not a huge\nfan of prawns. Because you\nare cultured and have probably met at least one Spanish\nErasmus student by now, I\u2019m\nsure you\u2019ll try paella and\ntortilla espanola without me\nrecommending it.\nFinal and perhaps surprising\ndestination: Poland. I\u2019m\nplanning on visiting soon\nand I\u2019ll share with you all\nthe dishes I\u2019ll be trying\n(you\u2019re welcome). Although\nI obviously disagree with the\nscorn often exhibited towards\nEastern Europe, I know that\nfew people know or appreciate the cuisine \u2013 except for\nmaybe borsch and \u2026uhm\u2026\nvodka. Unless of course\nthey\u2019re Eastern Europeans. So\nI will try and keep it short. If\nyou happen to be in Poland\nthis summer, definitely try\nsome pierogi. I was told that\nanything you buy anywhere\nelse in the world is just a very\nsad version of an authentic\nPolish pierogi. Also on my\nto-do list: grilled oscypek and\napple with bacon and cranberry sauce, sernik \u2013 because\nthere is never enough cheesecake \u2013 golabki and mazurka.\nI have faith in you and I\nknow that wherever you\u2019re\nplanning on going, you\u2019ll be\nable to find some amazing\nfood. Sure, if you search\nenough you can find pretty\nmuch anything in London. But,\nand this is a big but, you can\nonly try the authentic dishes\nin their birthplaces. Not to\nmention they\u2019re probably a\nlot cheaper in their country of\norigin.\nSo travel safe, eat well, and\nreturn with your tummies and\nbatteries full.\n\\\\ France is pretty\ndamn nice too if\nyou avoid the big\ncities, boiling hot\nand flowing with\ntourists \\\\\nadventure\n\\\\ Though I\nobviously disagree,\nI know that few\npeople know or\nappreciate the\nEastern European\ncuisine \\\\\nNicest royalty-free escargot picture we could find... // Kent Wang\n\n"

You need to\nsupport Gay Pride.\nIt\u2019s that rainbow month\nof the year again, when\nqueersallaroundtheworld\ntake to the streets to celebrate\nbeing alive and every bigoted\ndickhead gets the opportunity\nto rant about how they \u201cdon\u2019t\nmind The Gays but do they\nreally have to strap a dildo on\ntheir heads and strut around\nin public\u201d. Though such\nquestions tend to produce a\nsmall pulsating vein on my\nforehead, I\u2019ve come to realise\nthey do raise legitimate points.\nBecause how can people\nwho are uncomfortable with\nthe LGBTQ+ community be\nexpected to celebrate it when\nall they\u2019ve ever been asked to\ndo is to tolerate it?\nFuck tolerance.\nControversial, I know. For\na long time I really thought\ntolerance was the Holy Grail,\nbecause tolerance meant\nbeing allowed to exist. This\ntolerance came at the price of\nnot drawing attention to your\nirregularity, not provoking,\nbeing invisible and most\nimportantly being grateful for\nit. Today I want more.\nBefore coming out to my\nparents, I thought I\u2019d be happy\nwith not being disowned and\nalthough they accept and love\nme still, to say that I\u2019m happy\nwith the resolution of my big\ncoming out would be a lie.\nOur relationship has changed\nand although it\u2019s slowly being\nmended it will take years\nbefore they\u2019re comfortable\nwith who I am.\nThis spring my mother came\nto visit. We drank and talked\nand cried and got closer than\nI think we\u2019ve ever been. Still,\nwhen I joked about taking her\nto Pride with me she made it\nclear it would take a while\nbefore we got anywhere near\nthat stage.\nIt\u2019s understandable. She\u2019s of\na different generation. All I\ncan do is love her with all my\nheart and be there when she is\nready to join me. Some of my\nbest friends have repeatedly\ntold me I should be grateful\nfor the love and acceptance\nI\u2019ve received, and I really am.\nBut I\u2019m also asking for more,\nnot from my parents really but\nfrom society. I\u2019m done being\ntolerated, feeling appreciated\ndespite being gay.\nTolerance is great and all\nwhen we\u2019re talking about\nreligion, heatwaves, or\nLondon\u2019s crack fox population.\nBut really if you think about it,\ntolerance should not be used\nto describe groups of people.\nWe shouldn\u2019t tolerate\nthe Gays, the Muslims, the\nBlacks, the \u2018insert minority\ngroup's name here\u2019. They\u2019re\nnot ideologies, they\u2019re not\nadverse weather conditions,\nand they\u2019re not pests. They\u2019re\npeople.\nPeople are meant to be\nloved and celebrated. It\ndoesn\u2019t matter what you are.\nI don\u2019t care about the colour\nof your skin, your genitals,\nyour gender or lack thereof.\nI couldn\u2019t give a fuck about\nyour religion. I care about\nwho you are. I care about\nhow you treat me and others.\nBy offering tolerance to\nme you\u2019re disrespecting me\nby acknowledging your\nsuperiority and power over\nme. To ask for tolerance is\neven worse. It\u2019s an act of\ndesperation, an admittance of\ndefeat. Sure there are places\nin the world where members\nof the queer community have\nto literally plead for their lives,\nbut thankfully this is no longer\none of them. So I\u2019m done\npleading. I\u2019m ready to claim\nthe respect I deserve.\nIt\u2019s not an easy conclusion\nto arrive to. I myself didn\u2019t\nget it until I went to my first\nGay Pride last year. I had\njust completed a final round\nof very public coming outs\n(may it be the last one) to my\nextended family, and pretty\nmuch anyone who still kept\nwhen they almost indifferently\nsaid they would.\nI remember wandering\nthrough London and seeing\npeople being themselves,\nhappy, unafraid.\nI remember the speeches\nand the concerts and being\nable to share that moment with\npeople that I loved and who\nloved me back. That feeling of\nbelonging, acceptance, blind\nlove, community; that was\nthe closest I\u2019ve ever come to\nexperiencing God.\nI remember all the people\nmarching, some sporting\nfeathered buttplugs and\nleather chokers, others metre-high wigs and towering heels.\nPeople with hairy pits, legs,\nand crotches, people with\nunicorn makeup, flannel shirts,\nseptum piercings, shaved\nheads, tracksuits, gimpsuits,\nand suits made of latex. But\nmost vividly I remember the\n\u2018normies\u2019, the straight allies,\nthe ones who didn\u2019t care\nabout who anyone was, the\nones who\u2019d come to show their\nlove.\nBecause that\u2019s what Pride is\nreally about. It\u2019s transcended\nfrom a celebration of\nqueerness to a celebration\nof love. Love that crosses\nborders, disregards social\nnorms, colour blind love, tone-deaf love, gender-bending,\ncross-dressing, unboxable\nlove.\nAnd that\u2019s why you need to\ncelebrate Pride. Sure some\nof the events face inclusivity\nissues, or have complacently\nfallen victims to consumerism\nbut Pride remains one of the\nmost beautiful celebrations\nestablished by our civilization.\nIf you believe in a world\nunited, a world that trumps\nhate, where people can\njust unapologetically be\nthemselves, free, beautiful,\nand powerful, you simply\nhave to participate. It doesn\u2019t\nmatter what you are.\nJust love me and I will love\nyou back.\nNo that\u2019s not right.\nYou don\u2019t have to love me,\njust let me love you.\nin touch with me through\nsocial media, and I was free\nto publicly participate in\none of the world\u2019s largest\ncelebrations of queerness.\nI remember shyly almost\nasking some close friends\nwhether they\u2019d like to go to\nLondon Pride with me and the\nexcitement that engulfed me\n\\\\ How can people\nuncomfortable with the LGBTQ+\ncommunity be expected to\ncelebrate it when all they've\never been asked to do is\ntolerate it \\\\\n\\\\ Some of my best\nfriends have told me\nI should be grateful\nfor the love and\nacceptance I've\nreceived, and I really\nam. But I'm also\nasking for more \\\\\n\\\\ Before I came\nout to my parents, I\nthought I'd be happy\nwith not being\ndisowned \\\\\n\\\\ I'm done being\ntolerated, feeling\nappreciated despite\nbeing gay \\\\\n\\\\ That feeling\nof belonging,\nacceptance, blind\nlove, community;\nthat was the closest\nI've ever come to\nexperiencing God \\\\\nWriting mental\nillness off as a\npersonality quirk\nis dangerous\nVivien Hadlow thinks that warning\npeople against categorising personality\ntraits as mental illnesses can be\ncounterproductive\nT\nwo weeks ago, I\nread an article in\nfelix posing the\nquestion: \u201cAre\nwe medicalising\np e r s o n a l i t y ? \u201d\nThe author argues that self-diagnosis of a mental health\nproblem can be risky. I agree.\nThey argue that convincing\nyourself you have a mental\nillness when you don\u2019t,\ncan make you miserable. I\nagree. Something far more\ndangerous, however, is to\nconvince yourself you don\u2019t\nhave a mental health problem\nwhen you do.\nIf I had read this article in my\nfirst, or maybe even early on in\nmy second, year of university,\nit would have confirmed my\nworst fear: maybe I\u2019m just\nlike this. Maybe I\u2019m just a\nbit pathetic, and that\u2019s why\nI get stressed so easily and\nspend hours hyperventilating\nand crying for no apparent\nreason. And anyway, if I didn\u2019t\nwant to be stressed I should\nhave just gone to lectures and\ndone my work \u2013 it\u2019s my own\nfault for being so lazy and\nstaying in my room all day.\nMy life is fine, and thinking\nthat everything would be\nbetter if I didn\u2019t exist, is just\nmelodramatic self-indulgence.\nWhy on earth would I ask for\nhelp when all my problems\nare my fault? I\u2019m just like this.\nThis is the mentality that\nstopped me from seeking\nhelp until my second year of\nuniversity, and while I can\u2019t\nknow for sure how much\nearlier intervention would\nhave helped, I have no doubt\nthat it is this mentality that has\nlargely ruined my university\nexperience. And I am sure\nthat I am not alone in this.\nIt is extremely common for\nthose suffering from mental\nillness to have thoughts like\nthis, and blame themselves\nfor problems arising from\ntheir condition. I have always\nbeen quite lazy, and not\nparticularly sociable. These\nare personality traits of mine\nwhich have always meant\nI have to put in more effort\nthan many other people into\ndragging myself out of bed\nor doing my homework, and\nmakemyselfgooutwithfriends\ninstead of staying in my room.\nBut that was all it was \u2013 just a\nlittle bit more effort. It is worlds\naway from the days when I\ncannot even bring myself to\nget out of bed to brush my\nteeth. I can recognise this now,\nbut since my mental health\ndeteriorated gradually rather\nthan suddenly taking a turn for\nthe worse, it was very easy for\nme to confuse my depression\nwith my laziness, and my\nanxiety with self-induced\nstress. Even when I started to\nsuspect differently and look\nup information online about\ndepression, I felt an enormous\nsense of guilt and couldn\u2019t rid\nmyself of the feeling that I was\njust, as the author suggests,\nlooking for an excuse to hide\nbehind. Terrified of other\npeople forming the same\nopinion, I did my best to hide it\nfrom almost everyone \u2013 even\nmy first therapist, to whom I\ndownplayed the impact it was\nhaving on my life for fear that\nshe, too, would think it was\nmy own fault. Again, this is\nnot uncommon, but something\nthat many people who have\nsome form of mental health\nbetter to reach out to friends\nor people they trust to talk\nabout it rather than \u201cjust\ncalling themselves a bit shy\u201d.\nThe troubling implication of\nthis suggestion is that unless\nyou have what the author\nrefers to as a \u201cmedically\ndiagnosable mental health\nproblem\u201d, you should just get\nover it and accept that it\u2019s part\nof who you are. Reading it\nnow, having been receiving\ntreatment for over a year and\nspoken to numerous medical\nprofessionals, still made me\npanic about whether or not I\nreally had just been making\nup elaborate lies to myself\nand others to cover up the\nfact that I am lacking as a\nperson. To someone who has\nnot yet sought help, or is not\nsurrounded by the incredibly\nsupportive network of friends\nand family that I am lucky\nenough to have, it could be\nactively harmful.\nI am not disputing that the\narticle raises a valid point \u2013\nthere is a valuable discussion\nto be had about the risks of\nself-diagnosis and confusion\nbetween personality traits\nand mental illnesses. There is\na huge amount of information\nonline, much of it not written\nby health professionals, about\nmany different types of mental\nillness, and it is definitely\nnecessary to exercise caution\nwhen identifying with the\nsymptoms listed. Feeling\nlethargic and being reclusive\ndon\u2019t necessarily mean you\nare depressed, and feeling\nnervous about a social\nsituation doesn\u2019t necessarily\nmean you have social\nanxiety. Convincing yourself\nthat it does, which is very\npossible (everyone\u2019s made the\nmistake of turning to WebMD\nfor advice on a physical\nailment and decided they\u2019re\ndying), will be detrimental\nto your wellbeing. But the\narticle\u2019s focus on warning\npeople against mistaking a\npersonality trait as a mental\nillness serves to dissuade them\nfrom seeking help. There are\nalready enough obstacles to\npeople seeking help without\nactively feeding the paranoia\nthat they are being irrational\nand looking to shift the blame\nfor personal failings.\nproblem experience.\nPerhaps I am being naive,\nbut if someone has reason\nto believe they have social\nanxiety, maybe it would be\n\\\\ I have no doubt that this is the\nmentality that has largely ruined\nmy university experience \\\\\n\\\\ There is a\nvaluable discussion\nto be had about\nthe risks of self-diagnosis\\\\\n\\\\ It is extremely\ncommon for those\nsuffering from\nmental illness to\nblame themselves \\\\\n\\\\ The focus on\nwarning people\nagainst mistaking a\npersonality trait as a\nmental illness serves\nto dissuade them\nfrom seeking help \\\\\n\\\\ I felt an enormous\nsense of guilt and\ncouldn't rid myself of\nthe feeling that I was\njust, as the author\nsuggests, looking for\nan excuse to hide\nbehind \\\\\n\\\\ I did my best to\nhide it from almost\neveryone \u2013 even\nmy first therapist, to\nwhom I downplayed\nthe impact it was\nhaving on my life for\nfear that she, too,\nwould think it was\nmy own fault \\\\\n\n"

Blah.Blah.Blah\nfelixonline.co. uk /comment comment.felix@ic.ac.uk\nC O M M E N T\nWho are\nthe DUP?\nRatan Gor tries to clear up some post-election head-scratching\nL\nast week\u2019s general\nelection marked a\nmomentous occasion.\nThe youth, generally\nconsidered docile\nand apathetic when it\ncomes to politics and voting,\nwent out in their droves to\nflex their muscle. The main\nbattleground for the election\nwas social media. The\nweapons of choice: memes\nand parody videos ranging\nfrom the naughty corn-field\nmemes of Theresa May \u2013\nwhich gained a Harambelike following \u2013 to Jeremy\nCorbyn\u2019s face superimposed\nonto Stormzy\u2019s Shut-up video.\nThe events of the day played\nout in dramatic fashion.\nThe Conservatives, despite\nending up with the highest\ncomparative number of seats,\nfailed to secure a majority like\nthe one they had before the\nelection. Labour on the other\nhand managed to claw back\n30 seats \u2013 meteorically better\nthan what was projected to be\na colossal collapse. Perhaps\njust as significant as the\nnumber of seats won were the\n\\\\ Why the DUP and no one\nelse you may ask? Basically,\nno one else would dare cut\na deal with the Tories \\\\\nthe \u2018King Makers\u2019 of the\nelection as the Tories have\ntried to cut a deal with them in\norder to form a government.\nHowever, just who are they,\nwhat do they stand for, and\nwhy are they suddenly so\nimportant?\nFirst let's note that a majority\ngovernment helps legislation to\nbe passed through Parliament,\nas MPs of the governing party\ncan account for more than\nhalf the votes. A minority\ngovernment, on the other\nhand, has to sway members\nof other parties in order to get\nenough votes to pass a bill.\nCoalitions and deal-making\nwith other parties can help\ncreate a majority government\nand are the options Theresa\nMay\u2019s Conservatives are\ncurrently considering. This is\nwhere the DUP come in.\nWhy the DUP and no one\nelse you may ask? Basically,\nbecause no one else would\ndare cut a deal with the Tories\nat this moment in time for fear\nof alienating their voters and\ncommitting political suicide.\nAs a result, the DUP now have\nleverage over the Tories as\nthey know that Labour will be\nonly too willing to propose\ntheir own government with the\nbacking of any of the other\nparties, with whom they see\neye-to-eye with on a number\nof key issues.\nThe DUP is a right-wing,\nunionist, political party that\nis currently lead by Arlene\nFoster. Their position on key\nissues has been a cause for\nconcern for many over the\npast few days.\nTheir position on LGBTQ+\nrights, freedoms and liberties\nespecially concerning since\nThe Donald\u2019s messy pull out\nfrom the Paris Agreement.\nWe can\u2019t afford any more\ngovernments even considering\nneglecting this critical issue if\nour planet is to have a future.\nShould a deal therefore be\nagreed between the Tories\nand the DUP, the latter will\nhave the ear of a government\nwhich they would use to try\nand sway decisions made on\nsuch matters to bring them\nin-line with their archaic\nworldview.\nEx-Tory PM, Sir John Major,\nhas stated that cutting a deal\nwith the DUP would also go\nagainst the Good Friday\nAgreement which states that\nthe UK government should\nremain impartial when it\ncomes to dealing with political\nparties of Northern Ireland. So\nmaybe we are in for another\nhandbrake turn. If the last few\nweeks have taught us anything\nin fact, it is that Ms May is\nindeed the \u2018U-turn Queen\u2019.\nShe called this election looking\nto secure her coronation with\nan overwhelming majority.\nI'm sure this precarious\ngovernment wasn\u2019t quite what\nshe had in mind.\nThe Tories were ripped apart\nlike a fox on a hound hunt on\nJune 8th\n\u2013 poetic justice. They\nare now in intensive care and\nare seeking radical surgery to\nhelp stitch them back up. All\nother parties have refused to\noperate stating that the risks\nare too high. And while the\nDUP seem to be more than\nkeen to lend a helping hand,\nthe question is: at what price?\nWe will have to wait and see.\n\\\\ The DUP now\nhave leverage\nover the Tories as\nthey know that\nLabour will be\nonly too willing to\npropose their own\ngovernment \\\\\nmargins by which they were\nwon. MPs on both sides of the\naisle saw themselves elected\nwith wafer-thin margins as\nhistorical majorities melted like\nice-cream in the sun. UKIP was\nexpunged from parliament\nfailing to capture a single seat.\nThe SNP lost more than a third\nof theirs. Despite gaining\nfour more seats, the Lib Dems\nsuffered the loss of their\nsteward, Nick Clegg, who was\nrejected by Sheffield Hallam,\na seat which was thought to\nbe solid. Perhaps the most\nsignificant result came on the\nother side of the Irish Sea as\nthe Democratic Unionist Party\n(DUP) of Northern Ireland,\nwon ten seats. They have\nsubsequently been branded\nis unsettling, to say the least.\nThey oppose gay marriage\nso much so that they blocked\nit passing into law despite its\nwinning approval in Northern\nIreland's parliament in 2015.\nThey also vehemently\noppose abortion. In Northern\nIreland, the criteria for having\nan abortion are exceptionally\nstrict. This leads many to\ntravel to England to have the\nprocedure done privately.\nSuch a policy has even lead\nsome women to illegally buy\nmedication online if they are\nunable to afford the trip.\nThe DUP is riddled with\nclimate change sceptics,\nwith their ex environmental\nminister having outright called\nglobal warming a con. This is\n\\\\ They oppose\ngay marriage so\nmuch that they\nblocked it passing\ninto law despite its\nwinning approval in\nNorthern Ireland's\nparliament \\\\\n\\\\ The DUP is\nriddled with\nclimate change\nskeptics, with their\nex environmental\nminister having\noutright called\nglobal warming a\ncon \\\\\nThe failings\nof the\nConservatives\nAnsh Bhatnagar, the incoming\nsecretary of Imperial College Labour\nSociety, explains how we ended up in\nthis mess\nT\nheresa May went\nfor a power grab.\nShe wanted to wipe\nout Labour while her\nparty was polling\nwith almost 20\npoints ahead of them. With\na fragmented opposition\nand Corbyn\u2019s poor approval\nratings, everyone assumed it\nwas going to be a landslide\nelection. So how did this all\nbackfire and end up in a hung\nparliament?\n\\\\ Corbyn outperformed\neveryone's expectations,\nand he may well have done\nbetter had his MPs backed\nhim from the beginning \\\\\nConservatives were unable to\nkeep their majority.\nA Failure of Leadership\nWhen a Prime Minister calls\na snap election to \u201cbring\nstability to the country,\u201d\nyou would expect them to\nput forward the case for\ntheir party\u2019s leadership. Yet\ncomplacency and disregard\nfor the electorate was shown\nthroughout the campaign.\nRejecting calls for a debate\nwith Corbyn, including from\nthe man himself, was not\na power move \u2013 it looked\nweak. It was an opportunity\nto hit hard about why the\nTories were preferable for the\neconomy, security, and Brexit\nnegotiations. Yet May failed\nto appear in any debates and\nstooped as low as to send\nAmber Rudd in her place, less\nthan 48 hours after Rudd\u2019s\nfather\u2019s death.\nThe manifesto didn\u2019t help\neither. It looked half-arsed\nand not like something you\u2019d\nexpect from the only party\nwho knew there was going\nto be an election. Unlike\nLabour\u2019s, it wasn\u2019t even costed.\nThere are many challenges\nour society is facing (and lack\nof government control over the\nInternet is not one of them).\nWith weak suggestions such\nas bringing back fox hunting\nand introducing a dementia\ntax, the public understandably\nbecame dissatisfied with these\nideas.\nA Failure of Messaging\nAn over-reliance on\ntraditional media and tabloids\nalso contributed to May\u2019s\nloss of seats. The influence\nof these sources is waning,\nparticularly in an era where a\nGoogle search can reveal the\ntruth about a misrepresented\nopposition policy. On top\nof that, all the \u2018Corbyn is\na terrorist sympathiser!\u2019\nsmearing failed to stick. The\ntabloids went over the top,\nand it is likely that at least part\nof their readership rejected\ntheir incredulous claims.\nhim a \u2018weak pacifist\u2019 and a\n\u2018terrorist sympathiser\u2019 for\ndaring to suggest that perhaps\nBritain shouldn\u2019t be so keen on\nmilitary intervention abroad.\nA Failure of Judgment\nThe Conservatives failed to\nassess the situation properly,\nand they did not expect the\nLabour manifesto to land so\nwell. It was well written, fully\ncosted and comprehensive.\nThe Labour campaign\nsuccessfully showed that this\nisn\u2019t #EURef2, but a general\nelection that is about many\nmore issues than just Brexit.\nIt had a central theme: hope.\n\u2018Look at what our country\ncould become!\u2019 is definitively\nmore powerful than fear-mongering and complaining\nabout the other side \u2013\nsomething that plagued not\nonly May\u2019s campaign, but\nalso Ed Miliband in 2015.\nThis positive campaigning\nresonated with the electorate\nand is reflected in the gains\nthat Labour made.\nWith digital media, Corbyn\u2019s\nmessage found its way\nthrough to the young voters,\nwho turned out in droves\nand helped swing seats. He\nwas not a typical politician,\nartificial and polished like his\nConservative counterpart,\nand this helped in an era\nwhere people are becoming\nincreasingly disillusioned with\npolished politics. This led to\nthe massive audiences we\nsaw at Corbyn\u2019s rallies, and\nthe feeling that he had won\nthe hearts of a significant\nportion of the electorate, to\nthe surprise of the Tories.\nFriday came, Corbyn\noutperformed everyone\u2019s\nexpectations, and he may\nwell have done better had\nhis MPs backed him from the\nbeginning. On the other hand,\nMay\u2019s hideous campaign\nwhich blatantly disregarded\nthe electorate did not win over\nthe country. The public reacted\npredictably, depriving the\n\\\\ It should have\nbeen a slam\ndunk. Corbyn had\nnever been more\nunpopular \\\\\nAfter a massive U-turn on not\nholding a snap election, May\nset out to make it all about a\nsingle issue: Brexit. \u201cThe other\nparties hinder the process,\u201d\nshe said. \u201cWe must elect a\nstrong and stable government\nwith a mandate to pursue a\nhard Brexit.\u201d\nIt was simple. This wasn\u2019t\nabout the country, or stability\nfor Brexit negotiations. This\nwas a selfish decision made to\nbenefitherpartyandobliterate\nthe voices of the opposition. It\nshould have been a slam dunk.\nCorbyn had never been more\nunpopular, even with some\nof his most vocal supporters\nfeeling unsure about him.\nThe situation was bleak for\nLabour, and for the left wing\nin this country. Nonetheless,\nMay failed so severely that the\nA Failure of Substance\nThroughout her TV\nappearances, May was held\nto account over her record.\nAudience members would grill\nher about the cuts made to the\npolice, to schools, to disability\nallowances \u2013 all difficult\nto defend \u2013 while Corbyn\nunashamedly stood up for the\nLabour manifesto and did not\napologise for his beliefs.\nShe tried to look tough on\nterror by saying she would\ncurtail Internet freedom and\nscrap human rights laws while\npresiding over police cuts\nand arms deals with Saudi\nArabia \u2013 a country that funds\nmosques in the UK that preach\nthe Wahhabist interpretation\nof Islam which inspired ISIS.\nStill the tabloids went after\nCorbyn, simultaneously calling\nConservatives of a majority\nand forcing them to make a\ndeal with the far-right DUP,\nassociated with the radical\nProtestant Ulster Volunteer\nForce. Wait, wasn't Jezza\nmeant to be the one with ties\nto Irish paramilitary groups?\nByherownmetric,Mayfailed\non Thursday. She gambled her\nmajority, and lost the power\nshe had. By showcasing such\npoor decision making, she has\nnever looked as weak as she\ndoes now.\nSo here we are, as she\nwarned, at a coalition of\nchaos. Except it is Theresa\nMay, not Jeremy Corbyn, at\nits helm.\n\\\\ Complacency\nand disregard for\nthe electorate was\nshown throughout\nthe campaign \\\\\n\\\\ 'Look at what\nour country\ncould become' is\ndefinitively more\npowerful than fear-mongering and\ncomplaining about\nthe other side \\\\\n\n"
