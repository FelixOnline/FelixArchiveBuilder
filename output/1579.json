From the\ntop loor of one of the skyscrapers,\nSir Keith performed the ceremonial\nplanting of a Yew tree, preceded\nby a brief speech hinting that this\nis the irst of many undergraduate\naccommodation projects.\nhe \u201cOne Victoria Road\u201d project,\nwhich until recently had been\nmarketed as W3, involves the\nconstruction of four towers near\nNorth Acton tube station in Ealing.\nOnce opened to students, it will\nfeature space for 650 residents,\nalong with a gym, study and tutorial\nrooms, and social areas. he project is\ncurrently on schedule and is expected\nto open in October 2015; pricing is\nyet to be announced. his is College\u2019s\nthird project with Berkeley First, with\nthe two GradPad projects in Fulham\n(Orient House) and Battersea being\nthe other two.\nTopping Out the Halls at North Acton\nhe RCSU UROP bursary has been\nawarded to an undergraduate student\nfrom the Department of Chemistry.\nhis is a new initiative where the\nfunding will be from the RCSU\nfor students from lower income\nbackgrounds.\nPlabon Saha commented: \u201cWe also\nunderstand that one bursary might\nnot make a huge diference but this\nis seen as a symbolic gesture that\nwe hope will encourage the faculty\nto look into this issue and increase\nfunding. We also hope that some\nprovision can be set up for students\nfrom lower income backgrounds to\nundertake UROP placements. In the\nfuture, it was decided that the RCSU\nwill look towards pitching the idea of\nan UROP Bursary to our sponsors and\nhopefully replicate the BP awards that\ncurrently exist in Engineering.\u201d\nhe student receiving the funding\nsaid: \u201cI was delighted when I received\nthe news that I had been awarded the\nRCSU UROP bursary. Without it, my\nsummer project may not have been\nable to go ahead. Bursaries such as\nthese go a very long way in ensuring\nnobody is denied a valuable research\nopportunity purely on inancial\ngrounds and therefore allow the\nrecipient to gain essential research\nexperience without having to worry\nabout how living costs are going to\nbe met.

It plays a vital role\nin encouraging students into scientiic\ncareers and I believe more should\nbe done to encourage students into\nscience careers.

    "content": "11\n@feliximperial\nFelixImperial\nFRIDAY 06 JUN\nMUSIC\nT\nwo years ago I wrote a\nreview that examined three\nof the excellent releases\nby Oren Ambarchi in\n2012; Audience of One,\nImikuzushi (with Keiji Haino and\nJim O\u2019Rourke), and In the Mouth \u2013\nA Hand (with Fire!). he guitarist,\ndrummer, and electroacoustic\nimproviser who started his career as a\nJazz drummer in his native Australia\nhas since continued in the same vein.\nNumerous other releases have since\ncome out, including the excellent\nConnected, a collaborative efort with\nRobin Fox which was commisioned\nas a soundtrack for a dance piece.\nAmbarchi\u2019s music touches on\nambient, jazz, rock, krautrock, and, of\ncourse, noise.\nHe has a long history of collaborating\nwith some of the most accomplished\nartists in experimental music (see the\nnames dropped above or last year\u2019s\ncollaboration with Japanese legend\nMerzbow for a few examples).\nTwo years later, I find myself once\nagain staring down the barrel of a\nreview of another impressive trio of\nalbums, this time all collaborative\nefforts.\nTikkun (Above, left) is a\ncollaborative effort with the\nhugely influential Richard Pinhas.\nPinhas, a Frenchman, is the man\nbehind influential space rock group\nHeldon. Since then, he\u2019s continued\nto release excellent work under his\nown name, dabbling in tape loops\nand delays, collaborating with\nmany noise musicians and making\nmusic which, for my money, stands\nsomewhere between Heldon\u2019s\nsound, which had so much influence\non industrial music, and something\nOren Ambarchi: Two Years On\nmore raw and experimental. This\nis hardly a surprise, I suppose, due\nto Pinhas\u2019 work being intertwined\nwith some of the biggest names in\nnoise, for example 2010\u2019s Metal/\nCrystal, which featured both\nMerzbow and Wolf Eyes, who are\nthe biggest name in US noise.\nLike Metal/Crystal, the six tracks\nof which sprawl over a two hour\ndouble disc feature, Tikkun consists\nof three jams, two of which are over\ntwenty minutes, with the other\nclocking in at fifteen. It\u2019s hard not\nto look at the album as anything\nother than kindred spirits working\ntogether. Both musicians have\nsimilar approaches to collaboration\nand sounds which blend together\nseamlessly, with the mind altering\nkaliedoscopic sounds of space rock\nand exploratory forays into noise\nand ambient complementing each\nother.\nBoth artists\u2019 work has featured\nelements of both of these at one\ntime or another.\nTo my ear, the album immediately\nseemed more focused and well\nconstructed than Crystal/Metal\nand one of the first things I noticed\nwas the distinctive drumming style\nof Joe Talia (interviewed in Felix\nlast year), which has been a fixture\nin Ambarchi\u2019s live shows and many\nstudio works for the last few years.\nHis drumming style is incredibly\nwell suited to this work and really\ndrives it along, one example when\nthe drums join in with some\nclassic Ambarchi guitar work at\nthe beginning of \u2018San FranciscoT2V2\u2019.\nThe aforementioned guitar work\nis of course Ambarchi\u2019s favoured\nscratchy abrasive tone, although\nthe word tone may not be the best\nto describe the abrasive atonality of\nAmbarchi\u2019s guitar assaults. Other\nthan these elements and, of course,\nthe classic Pinhas sound, it\u2019s hard\nto pick out distinct elements and\nattribute them to\nsources. It should be\nnoted that Merzbow\nis also involved,\ncontributing some\nelectronics to\nthe amorphous\ncacophony this\nexcellent effort often\ncreates.\nShade Themes from\nKairos, released on\nDrag City on May\n27th sees Ambarchi\nworking with\nStephen O\u2019Malley\n(of Sunn O))) fame)\nand producer and\nMaster Musicians\nof Bukkake founder\nRandall Dunn.\nThe album was\nintended as a score\nfor Kairos, a film by\nBelgian filmmaker\nAlexis Destoop. In a\nsense it\u2019s hard to review the album\nwithout watching the film, but the\nalbum presents an eerie foreboding\nsense that all isn\u2019t quite well from\nthe start. Opening track \u2018That\nSpace Between\u2019. comes across like\nNeurosis style dirge, but expansive\nrather than claustrophobic and\nmore acoustic than metallic, before\nsome melodic chimes add a sense\nof comfort to the piece. \u2018Temporal,\nEponymous\u2019 starts off similarly and\ngradually evolves pretty formidable\njam, as a wide array of instruments\nare added to the mix.\nWhile these tracks are all very well\nand good, I\u2019m sure I wasn\u2019t alone in\nwondering at this point where the\ndrone and experimentalism was.\nIt need not be mentioned to any\nSunn O))) or Ambarchi fans that\nthe nature of the artists\u2019 work often\ninvolves a more abstract take on\nmusic and this is somewhat realised\non \u2018Circumstances of Faith,\u2019\nwhich opens with five minutes of\nrestrained feedback and drones\nwhich creep along menacingly until\nthey are punctuated by a rousing\ndrum beat and bassline.\nThe mellow and relaxing\n\u2018Sometimes\u2019 adds to the meditative\naspect to the album with its use\nof acoustic instrumentation and\npersistent rhythms. \u201cSometimes\u201d\nhas a very static quality to it, and\na comforting melody is acheived\nwith vocals from Japanese singer-songwriter Ai Aso. The final track\non the album, \u2018Ebony Pagoda\u2019, is the\ntwenty minute culmination of the\nalbum.\nIt certainly satisfies any hunger\nfor drone that may have built up\nover the course of the album (it\ncertainly did for me). Waves of\ncontrasting drones, sounding at\ntimes disconcerting and harsh,\nand at other times melodic and\ncomforting give the track a sort\nof cleansing feeling which is a\nperfect way to close the album.\nCertainly this track will satisfy any\ndrone cravings and comprises a\nrather exhausting musical journey,\ntossed one way and another by the\ninterplay of diverse droning sounds.\nOverall, the album is great at\ncreating a meditative yet sinister\natmosphere, but admittedly, the\nalbum could be even more varied\nand, for my money, misses the\nexplosive outburst of noise driven\nenergy which would really send it\nover the top.\nFifteen minute EP Stacte Karaoke\nis definitely the biggest surprise\nof the lot. An initial listen had me\nscrambling to the internet in an\nattempt to confirm that this was\nactually a new Ambarchi release\nand not some elaborate hoax.\nFurther inspection revealed, much\nto my surprise, that the album\u2019s\nclassic rock n\u2019roll boogie feel is due\nto a rhythm section comprised of\nfamously bearded Southern rockers\nZZ Top. I have to admit that this\nwasn\u2019t a collaboration I could have\nforeseen at the start of the year.\nAs far as I can tell, opener \u2018Milk\na Cow with a Monkey Wrench\u2019 is\nmore or less a classic 12-bar blues\npattern and, similarly, the second\ntrack \u2018Park It Where the Sun Don\u2019t\nShine\u2019 is based on a repetitive catchy\nriff. In both cases, we are treated to\nexplosive shredding blasts from the\naforementioned cathartic guitar\ntone and other extra layers from\nAmbarchi.\nWhile Ambarchi\u2019s Black Truffle\nlabel is often home to some of his\nmost experimental work, what\nmakes this EP stand out is the\nelement of whimsy and humour\nsurrounding the work, a rare\nmoment of frivolity and simple rock\nin experimental music.\nBeyond that, however, it\u2019s simply\nrelentlessly catchy and the short\nlength makes it hard to avoid\nrepeatedly playing these two great\ntracks.\nRiaz Agahi looks at the latest releases from the proliic guitarist\n\n"

How do the players teach the horses to swim?\nA\nfter losing most of last\nyear\u2019s players (half the\nteam were MSc students)\nthe IC ladies water polo\nteam had their ingers crossed for lots\nof girls to turn up to the irst couple\nof training sessions of the year. hey\ndidn\u2019t right from the start, but after\na few weeks we got there. With two\nnational league players, two girls newly\ntransferred from swimming to water\npolo, a few people who\u2019d played before\nand a good partnership with two of\nthe girls from the Medics water polo\nteam, we embarked upon our training\nfor this year\u2019s BUCS competition.\nAt our annual tour to Germany in\nNovember we even managed to win\na match, which had never happened\nbefore. Extremely happy about this\ngreat start to the season, nobody could\nhave known that this was only the\nbeginning\u2026\nAfter having come 3rd in our\nleague last year, we had stayed in the\nsame division, only facing UCL and\nSouthampton in a home \u2013 and away\nleague. On the 26th of January we\nplayed the irst mini-tournament at\nEthos. In the irst match, we narrowly\nmanaged to overtake Southampton\n7-5. he match afterwards was even\ntighter with us beating UCL by 7-6.\nhe week after, in the second mini-tournament at a pool with two deep\nends, Southampton and UCL were\nboth more convincingly beaten 7-3,\nmeaning we\u2019d won the league. Because\nthe BUCS competition structure had\nchanged this year, winning our league\ndid not mean automatic promotion to\nthe \u201cPremier South\u201d league \u2013 it merely\nmeant we\u2019d qualiied for taking part\nin playofs against the number 6 of\nthe premier league and the winner of\nWestern division 2.\nNeedless to say, we were happy to\nhave won the league \u2013 even though\nthere was so much more to come.\nAlongside the league, there was a\n(nationwide) knockout-path in the\night for the Trophy. Our irst match in\nthe irst round of this was against UCL\nat their home pool which is reasonably\ndeep, but narrow, so we\u2019d lucked out.\nWe all put up a good ight and after\na stressful four quarters we\u2019d beaten\nUCL once again, this time by 10-6.\nOnwards and upwards, our next\nmatch in the knockout tournament\nwas another away ixture, against UEA\nin Norwich. We had some trouble\ngetting our full team out and so we\nturned up to Norwich with just one\nsubstitute, only to ind that UEA had\nnone. It was a special match for us,\nbecause each of our players scored at\nleast one goal (even the goalie, who\nwas swapped for a ield player in the\ninal quarter just so that she could get\na goal). he inal score? 25-2 to us,\nwhich meant we\u2019d made it through\nthe irst two rounds of the Trophy\nchampionship, qualifying for the\nsemiinals.\nIn the semiinals we met\nSouthampton once again, alongside\nUWE and Warwick. We thought the\nlatter was going to be our strongest\nopponent, as did coach Adam who\ngot stuck elsewhere in the country\nand ended up missing the irst match\nof the tournament. hankfully this\nyear we were blessed with a second\ncoach, and so after the necessary\namounts of shouting from coach\nJoe\u2019s side we managed to win from\nSouthampton a third time with the\ninal score coming to 7-5. his didn\u2019t\nill us with conidence, but all worries\nwere unfounded as the game ended in\na smashing 13-4 win for us. he last\nsemiinal game against UWE, who\nwere playing in BUCS for the irst\ntime this year and as such had a fair\nnumber of players who barely knew\nhow to pick up a ball, was a real breeze\nwith us obliterating them in a 16-2\ngame. he three wins meant we\u2019d won\nthe semiinals and so we\u2019d qualiied for\nthe Trophy inals, which were to take\nplace during Trophy Tuesday. At the\ntime of playing this day was only 10\ndays away, but there was hardly any\ntime to celebrate, because our playof\nixtures against Bath (bottom of\nPremier South) and Gloucestershire\nuniversity (top of Western division 2)\nwere just around the corner.\nBUCS had randomly assigned our\nhome playof ixture to be against\nGloucestershire and our away ixture\nto be against Bath, with some random\nplaying dates that in water polo\nnobody adheres to. Except for the\nUniversity of Bath \u2013 who insisted we\nplay them on a Wednesday that we\ncould only make with exactly enough\nplayers for a team. Substituteless,\nwe skived of class and work and got\non a train to Bath. hey were clearly\nexpecting to claim an easy victory\nover our 7-woman team, asking us\nto rate ourselves against some of the\nIC Water Polo: Review of the Year\nother teams they\u2019d played before while\nwe were getting changed for the game.\nIt, therefore, didn\u2019t come as a surprise\nthat their captain refused to shake\nour hands after losing to us 18-5, with\nSophie scoring more goals by herself\n(7) than Bath did in total.\nhe next playof game against\nGloucestershire saw us turning up\nwith one substitute. We had clearly\ndone so before, but after having played\n10 matches in 9 weeks we were all\ngetting a little tired. In what felt like\na very stressful match we comfortably\nhammered them 12-5, thus gaining\nus promotion to the Premier South\nleague for next year. his amazing\nresult did not quite sink in, as our last\nmatch, the inal of the Trophy against\nLiverpool, was just days away.\nOn the 25th of March, we all headed\ndown to Guildford for \u201cTrophy\nTuesday\u201d. With support from Paula\nand Jackson representing the club,\nHannah, Anthony and Neil from\nSport Imperial, and Klara\u2019s and Jo\u2019s\nmothers we embarked upon this last\ntask of beating Liverpool. We knew it\nwasn\u2019t going to be easy, although a day\nor so before the match we found out\nthat we were the only ones in division\n2 who had so far remained unbeaten\n\u2013 Liverpool had lost one game during\nthe league stages at the beginning of\nthe season.\nhe match started of with all of us\nfeeling very nervous, and as a result\nmaking a good few mistakes. Each\nteam scored alternately and by half\ntime we were 2-1 down. he third\nquarter saw similarly tight scores,\nbut in the last half of the fourth\nquarter we managed to score 4 goals\nin a row, putting us to an 8-5 lead\nthat eventually culminated in a 10-6\nwin to us, securing that hard earned\ngold medal to end what has been an\namazing season of 12 matches, 139\ngoals (and 52 conceded, but we\u2019ll\nignore that), no lost games, lots of\ntravelling and amazing performances\nfrom everyone. And with that, I\nthink it\u2019s safe to say we\u2019re all very\nmuch looking forward to take on the\nopponents in the premier league next\nyear!\nAdinda de Wit\niC Water Polo\nsPoRt iMPERiAL\nOn Wednesday 28th May, Imperial\n1st XI travelled to Chichester to\nplay their 1st XI in a BUCS ixture.\nChichester were top of our league\nwith 3 wins from 3, so we went into\nthis game determined to get a good\nresult. We got of to the perfect start\nby missing our train to Chichester,\nbut were soon back on track (excuse\nthe pun) and raring to go.\nUpon arrival, it seemed God had\ndecided to take a lavatory break and\ninterrupt proceedings as the ground\nwas softer than Viggy\u2019s excuse for\nbeing late. Nevertheless, looking\nforward to taking advantage of the\nwet conditions and bowling irst,\nwe were promptly informed that we\nwere indeed batting.\nJuhin and Lomas opened up for\nImperial and batted solidly \u2013 a 50 run\nopening stand, with some beautiful\nshots down the ground from Juhin\nin particular. Unfortunately their left\narm spinner managed to turn one in\nthe end, bowling Juhin for 18.\nEnter the Mohit. Having banged\non for the past few weeks in these\nincisive journalistic masterpieces\nabout the IC 1st XI batsmen batting\nas if they\u2019ve had their arms removed,\nour very own Rahul Dravid, set up\n(corner) shop and anchored the\ninnings by building partnerships\nwith Lomas and Jayanth (after\nLomas was caught for 25). Having\nnegotiated a very tricky period\nwith a moving ball, and with the\nscore at 117-2 of 30 overs, Jayanth\ndecided to turn militant and started\nlaunching the ball to all parts of the\nground bringing up another ine 50,\nafter which the opposition\u2019s token\nginger was heard remarking \u201cthat\nwas the worst 50 I\u2019ve ever seen...\u201d (he\nconceded 14 runs of his next over...\nJust saying).\nWhilst Jayanth was batting like\na crack addict, Vishal was calmly\nbuilding his innings, ready to set\nof some ireworks near the end.\nJayanth was soon caught for what,\nin all seriousness, was a match\ndeining knock of 58, which meant\nthat last week\u2019s hero, the magician,\nthe entertainer, the captain himself,\nViggy Venkateswaren strode to the\nwicket and got ready to face his\nirst delivery. Rumour has it that\nViggy had recently acquired tickets\nto see \u2018One Direction\u2019 (his favourite\nboyband) in London, and indeed\nthere was only \u201cOne Direction\u201d he\nwas heading, when he was out LBW\nfor a golden duck - walking back to\nthe pavilion. I personally thought it\nwas a quacking knock.\nImperial\u2019s best looking cricketer\nthen walked out to bat, looking to\nmake an impact with the bat before\nhe takes an exam break from cricket.\nTogether Zain and Vishal saw\nImperial past 200, until Vishal holed\nout to deep square leg (he hasn\u2019t\nbeen to the gym much recently) for\na well made 41. Zain then ran Nick\nout without facing a ball, and Dave\nproved to us that Karma does in fact\nexist, as he ran Zain out soon after.\nWhilst an asthmatic sloth could have\nrun better than those two, Imperial\ninished on a steady 212 -8 of 50\novers, a more than competitive score\non a horrible wicket.\nCorrect me if I\u2019m wrong (Arvind\nI\u2019mlookingatyou)butanephropathy\nis deined as a disease of the kidney,\nsimilarly a neuropathy is a disease of\nthe nervous system.\nWell it seemed that Chichester\nwere sufering from a Ganapathy,\nbecause Jayanth opened the bowling\nand was all over them like a rash,\npicking up 3 early wickets for just\n17 runs of his 7 overs. Similarly\nSimon kept the pressure on bowling\n10 overs for 28 runs. he notorious\nV.I.G. (gy) then picked up 3 for 18\nto send Chichester on their way, as\nIC 1st XI beat Chichester 1st XI by\n102 runs.\nImperial \u2013 212-8. Chichester \u2013\n110 all out.\nAside from the landslide victory,\nthere was a fair amount of \u201cchat\u201d\nbetween the two teams during\nthe match, which culminated in\nChichester refusing to change the\nscoreboard, and then placing a\n\u201ccaution wet loor\u201d sign near the\nboundary where a couple of our\nielders had slipped.\nWe promptly shook hands, and\nleft for London, but not after Jayanth\nhad the last laugh (see picture).\nImperial have now got two out of\nthree wins, and can be considered\nreal title contenders this season.\nImperial thump Chichester\nZain Rizvi reports as iC record big win\niCu CRiCKEt\n\n"

It\nwould also improve the Group\u2019s ability to support\nportfolio companies from inception until their full\ndevelopment, as illustrated by the recent successful\nIPO of Circassia Pharmaceuticals.\n\u201cWe have identiied opportunities to increase\nthe capital deployed in a number of our leading\nportfolio companies, which, in aggregate, are\nseeking to raise over \u00a3100 million from investors\nover the next twelve months.\n\u201cIt is gratifying that our core shareholders\nhave evidenced their support for this proposed\nfundraising by giving irrevocable undertakings to\nvote in favour of the resolutions needed to enable\nthe Placing to proceed.\u201d\nLast week Felix reported that Yoyo had secured\n$5 million in funding, the majortiy coming from\nImperial Innovations.\nI\nmperial College have moved up four places\nto 5th in the latest Guardian University\nLeague Table. he college overtook\nUniversities such as Surrey, London\nSchool of Economics, University College\nLondon and Durham. he Guardian\u2019s league\ntable is based on numerous factors, including\nStudent to staf ratio, average spending per\nstudent, average grades required for attendance\nand graduate prospects. he College\u2019s graduate\nprospects were ranked highest in the country,\nbut the College\u2019s average student satisfaction\nwas lower than those of its closest rivals. he\nCollege\u2019s \u201caverage entry tarif\u201d, which is a ranking\nthat the Guardian gives based on a university\u2019s\naverage minimum exam grades for entry was\nranked as third in the country, behind Oxford\nand Cambridge.\nhis new league table is the latest in a string of\ntables that suggest that Cambridge has not only\nconsolidated,butisnowincreasingthegapbetween\nit and the chasing pack.

Avert\nyour eyes and don\u2019t be a buzzkill to\nruin television\u2019s top guilty pleasure,\nthe CW\u2019s interpretation of the life of\nMary, Queen of Scots. It must have\nbeen a rather bold decision, choosing to base an entire series around the\nEnglish period drama concept, focusing on an individual who clearly is\nnot someone who comes up as a daily\nconversation topic across the Atlantic,\nlet alone here in the U.K. And yet the\nchannel whose main audience target is\nteenagers, has done remarkably well.\nGiving the tale a suitable twist, Reign\nis a deceptively well-polished drama\nthat makes it okay to have the well\nworn-out storytelling mechanism of a\nlove triangle, because the stakes here\nare not just about broken hearts and\nhurting someone\u2019s feelings, but it also\nconcerns whether someone\u2019s head\ngets chopped off or not.\nThe French Court is never a safe\nplace to be, and yet poor Mary (Ade-laide Kane) has already been betrothed\nto wed Francis (Toby Regbo), the future King of France, from a very early\nage. Love counts for very little around\nhere, as stable alliances between powerful countries to stand united against\na threat are what every monarch is af-ter. Mary, as her title suggests, is the\nQueen of Scotland, although being of\nsuch a young age, her mother Mary de\nGuise (Amy Brenneman) rules as acting regent in her place. Francis brings\nwith him France of course, and this\nunion is supposed to deter the English\narmy from getting too feisty.\nBut danger lurks around the many\ncorners of the palace, with everyone up to something to further their\ngains. The series opens with an assassination attempt, and that is in no way\nthe last you\u2019ll see of someone trying\ndesperately to end another\u2019s life. The\ncurrent King Henry II of France not\nonly keeps his wife Queen Catherine\nde\u2019 Medici (Megan Follows) around,\nbut also his mistress, Diane de Poitiers (Anna Wolton), with whom he fathered a bastard, Sebastian (Torrance\nCoombs). Sexual tension runs high as\nboth Sebastian and Francis become\npotential candidates for Mary, and the\ntwo women surrounding Henry II are\nready to spill blood at any moment for\nfurther control and power.\nTreachery, plotting, scheming, are\nall what you can expect from Reign.\nEven for a CW show the series is not\nwithout taking its risks, both in terms\nof how much blood is shown but also\nwith how much flesh. Violence and\nsex go hand in hand particularly in a\ncostume drama such as this one, and\nwhile it may not be as raunchy as\nsome of the cable greats The Tudors\nor Rome, it certainly gets its job done\nin suggesting away. There was reportedly a masturbation scene that had to\nbe trimmed for the fear of angering\nconcerned parents.\nMary is thrown into the deep end\nfrom episode 1, having to deal with the\ncomplexities of being a part of a royal court, and how not to be killed by\none of the many, many who want her\nCatholic head. She has support from\nher four ladies in waiting, Lola (Anna\nPopplewell), Greer (Celina Sinden),\nKenna (Caitlin Stasey) and Aylee (Je-nessa Grant), all of whom are somewhat based on real-life counterparts.\nLike most women in those days, their\nnumber one priority is to become\nsomeone\u2019s wife - hopefully a man of\nhigh standing, good income, and noble background. Reign has a way of\nskillfully juggling the highly soapy nature of the plotlines, and once again,\nthe premise and medieval setting\nhelps enormously. These aren\u2019t some\nlovestruck high school girls looking\nto get laid. Whether they get married\nor not makes or breaks their lives, and\ntheir future safety depends on it. They\ncan think of love later, affection can\nbe worked on, but their potential husbands\u2019 social standing? Not so much.\nThe performances are uniformly outstanding. Kane, Regbo and\nCoombs deliver their often corny\nlines in regards to their love triangle\nwithout flinching and backing them\nall with serious emotion, an admirable skill of course. And they excel too\nexerting their authority - Mary in particular is the one having to undergo the\nmost significant change in personality\n- at first she is just a shy, clueless girl,\nbut as the first season wraps up, there\nare many scenes the audience is treated to the young Mary standing up for\nher rights, fighting for her interests,\nplotting and scheming for her benefit.\nIt\u2019s a gradual change and maturation\nshown well through Kane\u2019s steadily diversifying performance, getting us all\nexcited for what she has to show in the\nnext season.\nBut the one performance that truly\nstands out among everyone else is\nMegan Follows as Queen Catherine\nwho is simply perfection in every\nscene she is in. She out-acts everyone\njust by standing in the frame, and it\u2019s\ngame-over whenever she opens her\nvenomous mouth to speak, twist and\nmanipulate words to get her way. She\nis loyal only to herself and her son, and\nthis means she makes lots of friends,\nthen enemies, then friends again, and\nso on, throughout the series. It\u2019s head-spinning to try to keep up with where\neveryone\u2019s loyalty lies, and it\u2019s safe to\nassume that it\u2019s a deadly game of free-for-all, and the only person one can\ntruly trust is oneself.\nSpeaking of an older generation\nactress out-acting everyone else in\nthe cast, the best episode of season\n1 comes when the equally ruthless\nand scheming Mary de Guise drops\nby. Amy Brenneman only shows up\nfor one episode to play the mother of\nthe Queen of Scots, but she has a lot\nof fun and stirs up a lot of trouble in\nthe designated 40-minute slot of her\nsingle appearance. Here is hoping she\nwill be further utilised in the upcoming season, although nothing has confirmed this yet.\nBeing a historical drama there is\nheavy emphasis on what the characters are wearing, where they are\nstanding, and what kind of grand\nevent they are attending. No female\ncharacter wears the same dress twice,\nand the same can be said for the men\nin a higher class. The exquisite range\nof costumes on display here is an\namazing one, and although not all of\nthe shiny, over-the-top garments may\nfit into the period this show is depict-ing, it hardly matters as they all look\nstunning in them.\nWhen it comes to the soundtrack,\nthe series makes no apologies for\nshamelessly using songs from the\ncharts, as many backing tracks are\nfrom the likes of The Lumineers,\nBastille, London Grammar, Gabrielle\nAplin, there is even a string orchestra\u2019s rendition of Lorde\u2019s song Royals\nsubtly playing in the background of a\nballroom scene.\nHuman threats are not the only ones\nthat plague the palace. Dark, supernatural forces that hide within the\ndeep, dark woods surrounding the\nFrench Court also have a part to play,\nfurther adding to the sense of paranoia and unsettling fear.\nOf course, it\u2019s a show that is not supposed to be taken too seriously, certainly not within the historical context anyway. But it remains a highly\nentertaining period romp, with some\nkiller performances to attract even the\nsnobbiest of viewers. Mary Queen of\nScots lived a complicated, colourful\nlife, this should provide more than\nenough source material for the show.\nLong may she reign indeed.\nBergerac\nThis 80s gem comes to us from the\nscenic island of Jersey and stars good\nold Cornish boy John Nettles (now\nbetter known for top German TV hit,\nMidsummer Murders) as recovering\nalcoholic Jim Bergerac. Jersey native Bergerac rails against his island\u2019s\ntransformation from a tight knit pastoral fishing community to the arch-Thatcherite tax haven where Dave\nCameron\u2019s dad hid all of his money, all\nthe time driving around in his trademark vintage sports car solving the\npalest of white collar crime.\nNow, all good detectives have de-mons, and Bergerac\u2019s comes in the\nclassic form of a drink problem that\nresulted in the break-up of his marriage and a serious accident that is\npartially revealed through flashbacks\nin the course of the first series. Unlike most TV detectives, Bergerac\nbeats his alcoholism, demonstrated\nwell by a particularly strong 3rd series\nepisode in which he is kidnapped and\nforced to neck a bottle of whisky.\nBergerac is also joined by a host of\nrecurring characters, the most notable of which is his ex-father in law, the\ndelightfully dodgy tax exile Charlie\nHungerford, who manages to be instrumental in all but one of Bergerac\u2019s\n91 cases. We also meet a string of 80s-haired girlfriends, the first of which he\nseems to have stolen off his dead best\nfriend (best not judge); his annoying\nex-wife and adolescent daughter; and\nhis police colleagues, led by the combative Inspector Crozier.\nBergerac\u2019s cases, first as a Detective Sergeant of the absurdly titled\nand completely fictional \u2018bureau des\n\u00e9trangers\u2019 of the Jersey police and then\nas a private detective, span the full 80s\ngauntlet of shady financiers with giant beige computers, crooked arms\ndealers supplying apartheid era South\nAfrica, the New York mafia (yes, they\nmake the Jersey/New Jersey joke, they\ngo there), shady sheikhs, and the usual\ncommon villains.\nEven though some of the storylines\nmay seem corny to the discerning 21st\ncentury viewer (because they really\nare), Nettles\u2019 likeability and light comic touch carries the series, and makes\nBergerac prime 80s TV viewing. Just\ndon\u2019t let the sax nightmare of a theme\ntune put you off!\nNicholas Farmer\nTelevision Writer\nJohn Park\nTelevision Editor\n\n"
