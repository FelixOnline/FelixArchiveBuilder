Critics have argued that the\nban, which will come into place\nin January 2024, will put British\nuniversities under financial pressure.\nThe Government, however, says that\nnet migration is at unsustainable\nlevels. It argues that the number of\ndependents of overseas students has\nincreased by 750% since 2019, and\nthat this figure must fall.\nThe move appears to be a political\none, coming, as it did, two days before\nmigration figures were released by the\nOffice for National Statistics. Those\nfigures showed that net migration\n\u2013 the annual number of long-term\nimmigrants entering the country\nminus number of long-term emigrants\nexiting - reached a record high of\n606,000 in 2022.\nThey are heaping pressure onto the\nincumbent Conservative party,\nwhich made \u2018taking back control\u2019 of\nthe United Kingdom\u2019s borders a key\nelection pledge in 2019. Net migration\nhas increased threefold since then,\nand a poll carried out by Ipsos this\nmonth showed that only 29% of the\npublic trust the Conservatives on\nimmigration, compared with 38% for\nLabour.\nThere are genuine concerns around\nthe pressures on housing and public\nservices, but rather than dealing\nwith the problem of supply, the\nGovernment has taken the more\npolitically expedient approach of\ntargeting students.\nFurthermore, increases in the number\nofdependentscanlargelybeattributed\nto government policy. The UK has\nfrozen domestic undergraduate\ntuitionfeesat\u00a39,250,whichhasforced\nuniversities to find other sources of\nincome. Universities, in turn, have\nlooked to international students,\nwhose tuition fees are not capped.\nChinese students make up a significant\nproportion of this intake; in 2021/22,\n27% of all non-EU students in UK\nhigher education institutions were\nfrom China.\nHowever, over the past two years, as\nUK-China relations have deteriorated,\npolicymakers and sector regulators\nhave started to worry that universities\nare becoming too dependent on the\nnation for recruitment.\nAccording to analysis by Wonkhe,\nuniversities have since started to\ndiversify their international intake,\nwith the number of students from,\nin particular, Nigeria and India\nincreasing. These students, who tend\nto be older and more likely to have\nchildren or spouses, have brought with\nthem a greater number of dependents.\nIn 2022, reports Wonkhe, 60,923\ndependentsfromNigeriawereawarded\na visa, compared to 1,586 in 2019.\nThere are no easy options here, but the\nGovernment must make up its mind\non what its priorities are.

    "content": "FRIDAY 26TH MAY 2023\n11\nCOMMENT\nstaff at Imperial College.\nIn this year\u2019s pay award cycle, the JTU\nput in a pay claim of 10.5% - an amount\nwhich we show is clearly affordable by\nthe College, and is only attempting to\nprotect the value of staff pay against\nthe current inflation rate. As part of our\nresearch into the pay claim, we surveyed\nstaff on how the cost-of-living crisis was\naffecting them. The responses, some\nof which can be read in the full claim,\nwere both heart-rending and alarming,\nwith people providing stories of acute\nhardship, negatively-impacted work\nlives, and decisions to leave the College\nfor financial reasons.\nSadly, the SMT have not been\ncooperating to the level one might\nexpect, and, astonishingly, have not even\nseemedtobetakingthingsseriouslyuntil\nvery recently. Despite a promise to the\nJTU to bring the negotiations forward\nto better protect staff salaries, the SMT\nsat on the pay claim for six weeks before\nannouncing their first offer. As well as\nthe headline 5.2% offer being far from\nacceptable to staff, as it effectively means\na 5% pay cut, the SMT proffered no real\ncounter-arguments or refutations of the\nJTU\u2019s position, and the offer contained\nseveral basic mistakes, with copy-and-pasted tables with the wrong dates,\nand significant arithmetical errors on\nbasic percentages for salary scales. It felt\nextraordinary that managers in such a\npowerful position could put their name\nto something that hadn\u2019t even been\nproofread.\nThe JTU did respond with a\ncompromised counterproposal, but the\nsecond, so called \u2018full and final offer\u2019\nfrom the SMT on April 28th was not\nmuch more than a rehashing of their\noriginal offer with their own mistakes\ncorrected.\nIn 2020, in the midst of the ongoing\nbullying scandal, the College launched\nits \u2018Values and Behaviours\u2019 project,\npromoting five key virtues that would\npurportedly define the university and\nthe actions of all its staff. The righteous\ntraits of respect, collaboration, integrity,\ninnovation, and excellence have since\nbeen written into every Imperial policy\ndocument, found their way into staff\nemail signatures, and are the subject\nof regular Twitter broadcasts from the\nCollege account. Sadly, it is difficult to\nsee how any of these traits have been\nadhered to by College management in\nthe recent pay negotiations.\nNobody wants industrial action. But\nthe staff at Imperial College know that\nmanagementwillnotlistentoarguments\nbased on logic and compassion. They\nare role playing in one of the worst\naspects of end-stage capitalism and\nmodern business development, namely\nthe marketisation of higher education,\nwhere staff are treated as a cost to be\nmanaged. We are in a position where we\nfeel the only way management will listen\nis through the credible, and legal, threat\nof withdrawing our labour via forms of\nstrike action. Members of all three trade\nunions have voted for this, for the first\ntimeinImperialCollege\u2019srichandvaried\nhistory. The UCU have commenced\ntheir marking and assessment boycott\n(MAB) and there are five days of strike\naction declared during this term.\nIf we do not do this, the College will\ncontinue to erode the value of pay and\nconditions at Imperial. They purport to\ncareaboutstudentsbutarealreadytaking\nsteps to devalue your degree as a result of\nthemarkingandassessmentboycott(e.g.\nby giving technical marking duties to\ngraduatestudents,andallowingstudents\nto progress on half the usual credit for\nthe year) instead of concentrating on\nending the dispute.\nWe are not just doing this to protect\nour pay this year, but for the more global\nand fundamental purpose of protecting\nour university from becoming yet\nanother business, and ensuring the\nprofession is one that aspiring academics\nwill still want to join. This affects us all.\nThere are already signs that things are\nworking. All three unions\u2019 memberships\nsolidly rejected this year\u2019s pay offer and\nthe most recent formal response and\nmeeting with the JTU have provided\nindications that management are\nperhaps starting to react. It is highly\nlamentable that we are in this clearly\navoidable position, but there is now a\nglimmer of hope.\nYoucanhelpbyemailingthePresident\nandProvostandaskingthemtopaytheir\nstaff fairly.\nUnite and UCU members on strike over pay earlier this year.\nCredit: Felix\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk felixonline.co.uk\nSTAFF AT IMPERIAL\nCOLLEGE\nKNOW THAT\nMANAGEMENT\nWILL NOT LISTEN\nTO ARGUMENTS\nBASED ON LOGIC\nAND COMPASSION\n\u201c\n\n"

    "content": "KEEP THE CAT FREE\nSCIENCE\nscience.felix@imperial.ac.uk felixonline.co.uk\n6\n\u201cI was in the UK last autumn where\nI gave a seminar on the HelioSwarm\nmission for the Aeronautics students\nin the Mech Eng building which I\ncouldn\u2019t recognise, but as soon as I got\ninto the theatre, I then realised nothing\nhad changed! It\u2019s really great to come\nback and see how successful Imperial\ncontinues to be, following the research\nthat was done with COVID, calling\ninto many seminars featuring Imperial\u2019s\ncontributions - it\u2019s awesome to include\nImperial with NASA\u2019s portfolio that\nwe\u2019re working now. \u201d\nM: We know you did your\ndissertation here on geomagnetic\nstorms, perhaps you could explain to\nFelix readers a bit about them?\n\u201cSo, one of the things I like about\ngeomagnetic storms is that it is a linked\nsystem \u2013 starting at the Sun\u2019s core,\nradiating through the Sun, propagating\nthrough interplanetary medium and\nfinally interact with our planet\u2019s poles.\nIt really is a matter of how susceptible\nwe are to what's going on in the Sun,\nparticularly with regards to how\ntechnology is susceptible to space\nweather: for example, when your GPS\nisn\u2019t accurate, or you get a power grid\nthat goes down, or you lose satellite\ncoverage \u2013 these are all possible side\neffects of geomagnetic storms relating\nto our use of technology. The more we\nbecome reliant on technology, the more\nsusceptible we are to space weather, and\nthe sun is waking up \u2013 the Sun is really\nactive-it\u2019satitsmaximumphase:aurora\nhave been seen in really unusual places\nway far south, or north in the southern\nhemisphere \u2013 equatorward - than we\nnormally see. We need to predict and\nprotect against space weather.\u201d\nT: A lot of our information is\nsourced from amateur scientists in the\nfield-informationaboutgeomagnetic\nstorms needn\u2019t come from big players\nin the field. Should we keep data just\naffiliated with scientists working for\nNASA - or should we open up to\namateur researchers?\n\u201cNASA is a full open science agency\n- 2023 in the US is the year of open\nscience. And so we have a programme,\nwith a big push on open science. It\u2019s not\njust about making the data available - if\nyou don\u2019t understand the data - who\ncares if it\u2019s available or not you don\u2019t\nknow what the hell to do with it. It\u2019s also\naboutmakingthesciencebehinditopen,\nmaking the algorithms, so someone can\nreproduceresultsinapaper-wewantto\nmake sure all the code is open for people\nto use. There are some people who think\nthis is wonderful, there are some people\nwho really don\u2019t like it - and would like\nto keep their data before their papers\ncome out. It\u2019s a culture shift, it allows\nthe work of amateur astronomers to be\nrecognised. There\u2019s a big push for citizen\nscience - with citizen science you don\u2019t\nneed to have a PhD, you don\u2019t even need\na degree, you just need to be curious and\nwant to learn more.\n\u201cWe also have another programme\nkicking off soon, the Helio Big Yearties together the two eclipses here, the\nsolar maximum, and the Parker Solar\nProbe\u2019s closest approach to the Sun,\nand there\u2019s a big emphasis on citizen\nscience when we\u2019re probing what we can\nlearn too about the aurora. We actually\nhad successes on what we have learned\nfrom citizen scientists - she discovered\nan auroral feature that no one has seen\nbefore, but just by taking pictures of it\nthey saw what looked like a picket fence\nat the bottom of the aurora, no one had\nreally noticed it before - that\u2019s citizen\nscience. The more we can open up, the\nmorewelowerboundariesforeverybody\nto enjoy and share the joy of science.\u201d\nQuickfire questions\nAfter learning about Nicola\u2019s research\nin Heliophysics, we held a quickfire\nround - just to get to know the real\nNicola Fox and see beyond the science.\n1) Would you live in space?\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n2) If you could send any celebrity\ninto space, who would it be and why?\n\u201cDanielCraig,soIcansayImetJames\nBond.\u201d\n3) What\u2019s your favourite NASA\nmission?\n\u201cParker Solar Probe.\u201d\n4) Do you miss anything about the\nUK - if so, what is it you miss?\n\u201cOh, mostly it\u2019s food.

I am embarrassed to admit that\nmy first thought was \u2018Hey, this looks\nlike How I Met Your Mother\u2019. Many\nrooms are darkened to better see the\nlit-up exhibitions of colorful, furry, and\nstatuesque animals; which, when seen\nup close, are even more magnificent\nthan you would imagine. There is\nalso an exhibition titled \u2018Extinct and\nEndangered\u2019 full of high-definition\nclose-ups of mosquitoes, bees and\nwasps, grasshoppers, and other insects,\nall taken by photographer Levon Biss.\nAs a biomedical student, I enjoy these\nmore than I care to admit, regretting\nnot buying a copy of the pictures (albeit\noverpriced ones) at the gift shop.\nSunday \u2013 Easter brunch and a walk\ndown The Village to a cute little Italian\nrestaurant, where we spot Game of\nThrones actress Sophie Turner and her\nsinger husband, Joe Jonas.

    "content": "It\u2019s tricky to write an unpolarised TV review, and\neven trickier when the TV show in question is an\nexceptional one. The allegorical His Dark Materials\ntrilogy is fantastically philosophical and a deep study\nof humanity, and being an avid fan of the series, it took\nme some time to come round to the idea of seeing it\nfully realised on screen.\nIf you\u2019ve read Philip Pullman\u2019s novels, you\u2019ll know\nthat attempting to recreate the tale he concocted \u2013 and\nits many endless worlds \u2013 is a staggering task. Perhaps\none of the reasons why the 2007 movie version of his\nfirst book, The Golden Compass (Northern Lights), did\nso poorly is the difficulty of translating all the key plot\npoints and nuances of the books in a way that will appease diehard fans, while still making it marketable\nto wider audiences. But the BBC\u2019s TV adaptation of\nPullman\u2019s trilogy makes an excellent case for how TV\nshows might be the only way to truly do a book justice.\nEach novel in the series fits neatly into a season of the\nshow; purposefully touching on every important plot\npoint without wasting time on unnecessary scenes.\nI can\u2019t imagine a more artistic and thoughtful rendering than this one, and it\u2019s an exceedingly rare example of a TV series staying true to its literary roots.\nWhere so many other cinematic adaptations of books\nfall disappointingly short, the His Dark Materials series brings the novels to technicolour life, making you\nfeel as though you\u2019re living and breathing the adven-ture. It begins in alternate-universe Oxford, but soon\ntakes viewers far beyond the confines of the city, and\nthough it is very clearly a different realm to our own,\nthere is a realism to the scenes that makes the story almost tangible.\nThe cast is extraordinarily compelling; almost every\nactor in the series could just as easily pass for their\ncharacter as for themselves, and\nsome even more so. Dafne Keen\nand Amir Wilson are incredible\nas main characters Lyra and\nWill, and the supporting cast is filled with a\nhost of tried-and-tested\nactors. James McAvoy,\nRuth Wilson, Lin-Manuel Miranda, Will\nKeen, Anne-Marie\nDuff, and the late\nHelen McCrory to name a few; though the list could\ngo on.\nA few of these actors aren\u2019t identifiable by face, as\nthey play the manifestations of humans\u2019 souls in Lyra\u2019s\nworld - their \u2018daemons\u2019. You can see them scattered\naround this page, appearing as animals that embody\nthe core qualities of their respective humans. The bond\nbetween these daemons and their people is an important element in the story, but I\u2019ll leave it up to you to\nfind out exactly why.\nAlways essential to a show\u2019s success is its musical\nscore,andthisone\u2019sisnoexception;theopeningtheme\nalone is hauntingly dramatic. Any decent score should\ncomplement what\u2019s happening on-screen and also be\nstrikingly noticeable during significant plot points, and\nLorne Balfe\u2019s compositions do exactly that.\nAll too often, a show\u2019s cast and crew are let down by\na terrible script, particularly when it comes to translating literature to the big (or small) screen. That wasn\u2019t\nthe case here, and the script stayed so true to the novels as to actually use lines pulled straight off the pag-es, further cementing it as a must-watch for fans of the\nbooks. The ending of the trilogy is similarly honoured,\nand perfectly concluded in the finale of the show, leaving only any loose ends that were also left by Pullman\nhimself.\nAlthough containing elements that could potentially be confusing for viewers who haven\u2019t read the novels,\nI trust that Pullman\u2019s deft world-building has seeped\ninto the series, making it accessible to anyone interested in taking a trip to Lyra\u2019s Oxford. This\nis definitely o n e of the best new\nTV shows I\u2019ve watched in years,\nand I hope you\u2019ve been\nc o n v i n c e d to give it a\nchance; either as a respite\nfrom revision or as a re- ward for\ncompleting your pesky exams!\nEdited by: Jonah Hewett\nMike Buzadji\nFilm&TV\nZanna Buckland Co-Editor-in-Chief\nKEEP THE CAT FREE\n14 film.felix@imperial.ac.uk felixonline.co.uk\nFILM & TV\nHis Dark Materials\nTelevision Review\nWhere can I watch it?\nSeasons:\nEpisodes:\n3\n23\nHis Dark Materials is available to watch\nnow for free on BBC iPlayer!\n(if you have a TV licence, or if you don\u2019t you can use\nmine, dw)\nBooks Editor Zanna Buckland reviews the BBC adaptation of Philip Pullman\u2019s immortal trilogy.\nLyra Belacqua and friends Iorek Byrnison (a talking armoured polar bear - not a daemon!) and Roger (in the background).\nCristela\nAlonzo\n[Cars 3]\nvoices\nHester,\nthis hare\ndaemon.\n\n"

I did have\none tutor - I won\u2019t\nname a name \u2013 who\ndid make me feel\nlike I didn\u2019t belong\nand was very much\none of the \u201cCan one\nof you clever lads\ngive me an answer?\u201d types, and I was just\nsitting there thinking \u2013 I guess I won\u2019t\nspeakupthen.Butthatwasonetutor-I\nhadreallysupportivepeoplethroughout.\nMichele actually was a postdoc when I\nwas a postgraduate student - she\u2019ll tell\nyou that, and she\u2019s great. She was already\nworking on Cassini and Ulysses and\nplaying vital roles. It was really great to\nsee her taking up all those roles.\u201d\nAs of 2021/22, Imperial is\nnow a lot more balanced in\nterms of gender, with a\nsplit of 40.4% women\nto 59.6% men, and\nthe Physics department is currently\nat a male to female ratio of\napproximately\n70:30. Whilst\nconditions with professors have improved,\nwith professors being a lot\nmore supportive, female students\nin the undergraduate cohorts have\nnoticed the culture of a \u201cboys' club\u201d still\nexists in the student body, with female\nstudents feeling the need to prove themselves and fight to be heard.\n\u201cMore opportunities, and being told\nthat STEM and science are not just for\nboys \u2013 you know that feeling that starts\npretty early in schools where girls do\nthis, and boys do that. It\u2019s not gone away\ncompletely, but I think that more people\ncan see themselves in\nthose fields now.\u201d\nNicola herself\nwas Women\u2019s Officer in the Union\nduring her doctoral studies and has\na long history herself of advocating\nfor women here at\nImperial. Currently, there have been\nmany more initiatives within Imperial\nand Physics itself, with the Women and\nNon-Binary Individuals in Physics Society established within Blackett today\n(check out their Twitter: @ic_wip).\nM: Was NASA always something\nyou wanted to do or was it equal parts\nopportunity and hard work?\n\u201cI\u2019d say it was both! I always thought\nNASA was this mythical, inspiring,\namazing thing - everything NASA did\nwas cool - I didn\u2019t know there would\nbe an opportunity for me to go work\nthere. I was doing my PhD in Space and\nAtmospheric Physics - in 6M Huxley,\u201d\n[another laugh and knowing smile].\n\u201cWhilst I was at a conference with scientists at NASA, one asked me if I would\nbe interested in applying for a postdoc\nat NASA, and I didn\u2019t even know that\nwas an option. At the time I thought I\nwas going to Leicester and work on the\nCluster Mission. I did the application\nandgotaccepted.ButonceIgothere,it\u2019s\nhard work. I work really hard. Overall,\nit\u2019s opportunity and hard work!\u201d\nNicola herself was the first person in\nher family to attend university, with her\nfamily coming from the Liverpool area,\nhistorically ome of the most deprived\nareas in the United Kingdom. Coming\nfrom similar backgrounds, and even\nsimilar areas in Taylor\u2019s case, we agreed\nthat there was a lot of perseverance involved in reaching the positions we had\ntoday. \u201cI really thought NASA wouldn\u2019t\nhave an opportunity for someone like\nme. I didn\u2019t know they had a postdoc\nprogramme that was open to somebody\noutside of the US, and so it was just not\nknowing the opportunity was there and\ntaking it as soon as I got the opportunity.\u201d\nT: Imperial has been a big collaborator with NASA. How does it feel\nto work with your alma mater, and to\nwork with your roots, really, and oversee projects at Imperial?\n\u201cI\u2019m really proud of Imperial, and the\nwork they do, particularly the role they\nplay in the work done at NASA, such\nas the partnership with JUICE. Up in\nHuxley 6M, they\u2019re building magneto-meters, one of which will be going on\nthe IMAP mission launching in 2025\n- nine are going on a HelioSwarm\nmission in 2028.

    "content": "comment.felix@imperial.ac.uk felixonline.co.uk\nThe current UK cost-of-living crisis\nis affecting us all. With general\ninflation at around 10% for the past two\nyears and augmented hikes on universal\nneeds such as food, rent, bills, mortgage\nrates, and fuel, people and companies\nare feeling severe financial pressure. One\neffect of the crisis concerns workers\u2019\nincome\u2013iforganisationsdonotincrease\ntheir workers\u2019 wages proportionally in\nline with the increased cost of living,\nthen they become effectively poorer and\nless able to live their lives with dignity.\nSadly, this is often the case, and workers\nin various key sectors across the nation\nsuch as transport workers, NHS staff,\nteachers, and even lawyers have been\nstaging strike action in protest over\npaltry rises that do little to protect the\nreal value of their salary.\nThe higher education sector has not\nbucked this trend, and staff in over 150\ninstitutes are in formal dispute with\nthe University & Colleges\u2019 Employers\nAssociation (UCEA) over a national\npay offer to university staff of 5% for this\nyear. It may be a surprise for readers to\nhear that Imperial College is not part of\nthis national dispute.\nImperial is a somewhat unique UK\nuniversity, with its STEMMB (science,\ntechnology, engineering, mathematics,\nmedicine, business) focus and prime\ncentral London location immediately\nsetting it apart. There are also several\nunusual features of its operational\nstructure; for example, the College\ndoes not belong to the large federation\nof institutes forming the University\nof London, and its Student Union is\ndisaffiliated from the National Union of\nStudents.\nAnother important feature is that\nImperial withdrew from national pay\nbargaining with UCEA nearly 20 years\nago, and has since conducted local pay\nbargaining, meaning that unlike most\nUK higher education institutes, it has\nautonomy over its decisions on annual\npay awards, in negotiation with the local\nJoint Trade Union (JTU) branches.\nUsually, the JTU and the senior\nmanagement team (SMT) are able reach\nan annual agreement, but last year the\nSMT\u2019s imposition of a 3.3% pay offer\nwithout JTU agreement was simply too\nmuch for staff to bear \u2014 a 3% pay award\nwith inflation at over 10% is essentially\na 7% pay cut. This meagre offering was\nparticularly jarring as we moved out of\nthe pandemic, where the labours of staff\nhad been absolutely extraordinary and\nthe subject of near-universal internal\nand external praise, with the College\nloudly flaunting its Times & Sunday\nTime University of the Year award for\n2021. Members of all three trade unions\nvoted to enter into a formal dispute with\nthe College in September 2022. Sadly,\nthis dispute has not been resolved, and\nthe problem has only become more\npronounced.\nBluntly put, Imperial College is\nrolling in cash. With annual income and\nexpenditureinexcessof\u00a31billion,andan\naverage annual surplus of approximately\n\u00a310 million (with a record surplus of\n\u00a3162 million for 2020-21) it is one of\nthe wealthiest universities in the UK,\naccording to the College\u2019s annual report\nfrom 2022. Much of the money is put to\nundeniably good use, with some world\nclass buildings, research, and teaching\nfacilities, but some of the distribution\nof resources is more contentious,\nsuch as investment in real estate and\nextraordinary remuneration packages\nfor the top 10 earners in the College. Of\ncourse, Imperial has also been hit with\nincreased operational costs \u2013 this year\u2019s\nenergy bill will be an eye-watering \u00a340\nmillion higher than previous years, but\nthe fact is that the College still has the\nfinancial strength to properly protect its\nstaff with an annual pay award that is in\nline with inflation.\nIt is curious that President Hugh\nBrady agrees with the position that\nthe College should increase its staff\npay in line with inflation. In a 2019\ninterview with the Bristol student\nnewspaper Epigram the then VC of\nBristol Professor Brady lamented that\nhis former employer could not award a\npay deal in line with inflation as it is part\nof national bargaining, and stated that\nhad Bristol possessed the autonomy to\naward pay in line with inflation it would\ndo just that. Now Professor Brady is in\na position to honour this principle for\nImperial must raise staff wages in line\nwith inflation\nThe Joint Trade Unions\n(UCU, UNISON & Unite)\nat Imperial College London\nCOMMENT\nThe Joint Trade Unions write to inform students about the reasoning behind the ongoing strikes to increase staff wages.\nCredit: HESA/UCEA/Imperial\nTHE COLLEGE STILL HAS THE\nFINANCIAL STRENGTH TO PROPERLY\nPROTECT ITS STAFF WITH AN ANNUAL\nPAY AWARD THAT IS IN LINE WITH\nINFLATION\n\u201c\nImperial\u2019s annual surplus as a percentage of income is consistently higher than the majority of the university sector,\nyet their proportional annual pay offer is lower.\nComment\nEdited by: Elif Civelekoglu\nKEEP THE CAT FREE\n10\n\n"

    "content": "FRIDAY 26TH MAY 2023\nSCIENCE\nscience.felix@imperial.ac.uk felixonline.co.uk\nlook at for many reasons: one looking\nfor what are the building blocks for early\nplanet formation, in the 22nd century\nBennu will be on a close trajectory to\nEarth \u2013 so learning what the asteroid is\nlike means that we can design a mission,\nif we needed to, to actually move the\nasteroid away. In October, we launched\nthe Psyche mission, which is going out\nto another asteroid, which we think\ncontains heavy metals. So, for me, some\nof the excitement is when you have\ngroups of these missions that together\ndo incredible things. Also have the Mars\nSample return. Actually, going to Mars,\nwe already have the Perseverance rover\nroving around on the Martian surface,\ntaking samples, and leaving them for us\ntogobackandcollectthem.Wealsohave\na helicopter on Mars, which is amazing.\nThat\u2019s step one of the sample return. It\nsounds easy, just to go and collect some\nsamples from Mars \u2013 but it\u2019s so hard \u2013\neven launching from another planets \u2013\nwhere there\u2019s no launch pad or tower is\ntremendously difficult. The Mars sample\nreturn is a super exciting mission. We\u2019ve\nalso launched TEMPO, which will be\nlooking at pollution, 24/7, over the\nNorth American continent, which\naims to monitor how pollution changes\nduring the day. I\u2019m basically excited\nfor all of them \u2013 but I certainly think\nbringing samples back from Mars is the\nmost exciting mission this year.\u201d (Never\ntrust a physicist to be concise.)\nBoldly going forwards:\nWhat's next for NASA and\nNicola?\nT: Are there any missions that NASA\ncould potentially develop to probe an\nunderstanding to unexplored regions\nof our Universe?\n\u201cThe more we see with the James Webb\nTelescope, the more I want to see. With\nthose images, you just think, my God,\nour entire solar system is like a tiny pixel\nin what I\u2019m looking at in this image;\nand so, wanting to know more about\nother stellar systems and how those\nwork is something I\u2019m really excited in\ncontinuing to do.\n\u201cContinuing to explore space\noutside our solar system \u2013 we have\nthe two Voyagers that are outside the\nheliosphere (influence of the Sun), and\nthey\u2019re in interstellar space. They\u2019re 45\nyears old, they\u2019re not designed to do\nthat type of science on what protects\nus from interstellar space. The idea that\nof designing and sending a\nmission that would travel\nfast into interstellar space,\nand really tell us what is\nout there, when we say we\nare protected by our sun\nand the heliosphere from\ninterstellar space \u2013 what are\nwe really protected from \u2013\nwhat else is out there?\n\u201cI also think the poles of\nthe Sun. That\u2019s going to be\na real key to understanding\nhow a star works, Solar\nOrbiter is going out of the\necliptic plane so they can\nlook down into the poles\nof the sun. Like Ulysses \u2013\nwhich will be closer to the\nSun, with images \u2013 so we\ncan take in-situ data and\ninvestigate how the Sun\nis changing with the solar\ncycle and look at the polar\nregions of the Sun.

    "content": "Hammersmith and Fulham (H&F)\nis probably the most lived-in\nborough for Imperial students after\nleaving halls. Aside from the bustle\nof Hammersmith Broadway and the\nglamour of Westfield, the area has 50\ngreen spaces, ranging from church\ngardens to the expansive Wormwood\nScrubs. This month, these spaces were\nleft to grow wild in support of the \u2018No\nMow May\u2019 campaign.\nThe campaign, started by the charity\nPlantlife in 2019, encourages owners\nof green spaces not to mow them for\nthe entire month of May. According to\nthe Plantlife website, the UK has lost\nover 97% of its flower-rich meadows\nin the last 70 or so years. Not mowing\ngreen spaces allows such meadows to\ngrow, attracting pollinating insects and\ntherefore birds and hedgehogs. May\nis when grasses start to grow faster in\nresponsetowarmertemperatures,andso\nis a common time for many households\nto get the lawnmower out of the shed.\nHowever, long grass provides moisture\ntothesoil\u2013benefittingsoilinvertebrates\nand the animals that feed on them.\nOne of the most common wildflowers\nobserved in the unmowed gardens of\nH&F is the dandelion. They are usually\nconsidered weeds because of their fast\ngrowth, high seed production, and tap\nroots that regrow after the visible parts\nof the plant are removed. Despite that,\nit\u2019s difficult not to love the bright yellow\nflowers that have adorned Fulham\u2019s\nstreets this month, and their fluffy seed\nheads full of superstition and childhood\nmemories. Dandelions provide a wide\nrange of bees with nectar and pollen,\nbecause their open flower shape is\naccessible to many species. In fact,\ndandelions provide 9% of the pollen and\n37% of the nectar from a typical lawn.\nButtercups and daisies flourish even\nmore during \u2018No Mow May\u2019 than they\ndo normally. Daisies provide food for\nsolitarybeesandbeetles,especiallywhere\nno other flowers can\nbe found. Buttercups\ncan attract bees,\nbutterflies and moths\nto unmowed lawns\n\u2013 but pet owners\nshould beware\nbecause buttercups\nare toxic to cats\nand dogs. Another\ncommon sight during\n\u2018No Mow May\u2019 is\ngeraniums, whose\nnectar-rich magenta\nflowers are visited by\nbuff-tailed and white-tailed bumblebees,\namong others. Pale\nblue forget-me-nots,\nwhich can also attract\nbees and butterflies,\nare also found in\nH&F\u2019s green spaces\nand community\ngardens in May. And\nthese are just the\ncommonly found\nplants! A citizen\nscience survey in\n2021 showed that\ngardeners who did\nnot mow their lawn\nfound over 250 wild\nplant species in their\ngarden \u2013 including\nwild garlic, wild\nstrawberry, and many\ntypes of orchids.\nMargravine and\nFulham cemeteries\nalso put on a show\nduring \u2018No Mow\nMay\u2019, as wildflowers\ncoexist with flowers\nplanted in memory of\nloved ones. Bluebells\ncan be spotted in\nboth cemeteries \u2013\nthough the native\nspecies feeds\nhoverflies, woodland\nbutterflies, and bees, the Spanish species\nis outcompeting and hybridising with it.\nThecowparsleyinMargravineCemetery\nlooked like clouds on stems \u2013 attracting\nbutterflies, hoverflies, and sometimes\nrabbits. So although the biodiversity\ncrisis may seem dire, less may be more\nwhen it comes to mowing green spaces.\nAs spaces like the cemeteries have\nbeen thriving this month, now is a\ngood time to assess what else the H&F\ncouncil is doing to help solve the climate\nand biodiversity crises. The council\ndeclared a climate and ecological\nemergency in 2019, and aims to make\nits operations net-zero by 2030. All its\ncouncil buildings are run on renewable\nelectricity, and heat pumps are being\ninstalled in four non-domestic and\nthree residential sites. H&F is home\nto London\u2019s first \u2018tiny forest\u2019, a dense\nwoodland that is part of an initiative run\nby Earthwatch Europe. There are now\ntwo more such volunteer-run forests in\ntheborough.Sustainableurbandrainage\nsystems have been installed in the White\nCity and Queen Caroline estates.\nThe council\u2019s 2030 Climate and\nEcology Strategy addresses five\nchallenges \u2013 homes and buildings,\ntravel, consumption, ecology, and\nadapting to a changing climate \u2013 but\nnot many of their targets are quantified.\nAlthough clear efforts have been made\nto improve biodiversity and reduce\ncarbon emissions in H&F, more action\nwill be required from individuals and\ngovernments to truly tackle these five\nchallenges.\nHammersmith and Fulham\ncelebrates \u2018No Mow May\u2019\nenvironment.felix@imperial.ac.uk felixonline.co.uk\nSimran Patel Environment Editor\nFRIDAY 26TH MAY 2023\n9\nENVIRONMENT\nHammersmith and Fulham council stops mowing public green spaces every May \u2013 and the results are gorgeous.\nCredit: Simran Patel\nCredit: Simran Patel\nCredit: Simran Patel\nCredit: Simran Patel\nCredit: Simran Patel\nTop to bottom: Buttercups and daisies along Lillie Road, dandelions and\nforget-me-nots in Bayonne Park, cow parsley in Margravine Cemetery, and\nbluebells in Fulham Cemetery.\n\n"

The idea that she is Head of Science, or, to use her full title, Associate\nAdministrator for NASA\u2019s Science MissionDirectorate,neverreallycrossedour\nminds as we interviewed her, in the sense\nthat as Physics undergrads, we would essentially be interviewing someone who\nwas very much at the top of the Physics\nachievement ladder (which, as Imperial\nPhysics students know, is a very, very big\ndeal).\nWe start off by exchanging pleasant-ries, and discussing our Quantum Physics exam, which we were about to undertake the following morning. She smiles,\ntelling us not to worry about Quantum\nPhysics, and that she personally took the\nPractical courses (for the reader\u2019s bene-fit, Taylor is on the Theoretical Stream\nand so will not have to do any more labs\nin his degree, whilst Mohammad, will\nstill be doing labs next year). There is a\nsardonic tone to this exchange, a sort of\ninsider awareness that one can assume\nis the sort of feeling war veterans have\nwhen they meet each other years after\nthe war.\nA new dawn at NASA: the\n\u2018second space age\u2019\nM: Obviously at NASA, there are a\nlot of exciting missions going on, with\nArtemis launching in a few years, just\nrecently with JUICE in collaboration\nwith the College, and of course a\nlot of private companies launching\ntheir own shuttles and rockets. How\ndoes it feel being the Head of Science\nat NASA during what is essentially the\nsecond space age?\n\u201cIt\u2019s really great. It\u2019s really exciting.\nAnd I agree with you, it feels a lot like a\nsecond space age. We\u2019re standing in the\ntime before you know, it\u2019s right before\neverything is going to start to reenergise.\nWiththeArtemisandtheMarsmissions,\nwe just announced the crew that will fly\non Artemis II and go around the Moon\nand have a sustained trip around space,\nand my job is really integrating the\nscience into these missions - what do\nwe want to do before we launch these\nmissions, on the international space\nstation, on the Orion capsule, what\u2019s\ninside of it. Even in Artemis I we had\na lot of biology experiments that were\ninside, looking at how yeast and seeds\nand algae and fungi react to space. So\nyeah, it\u2019s very exciting.\u201d\nT: The International Space Station,\nwhich is set to be retiring soon, is\nknown for its experiments, such as the\ntwinsexperimentswithMarkandScott\nKelly, testing microgravity, and BoseEinsteincondensates.\nThere are tonnes\nof applications\npossible with\nresearch like this;\nis this something\nyou really want to\nintegrate, and are\nthere particular\ndisciplines you\nwant to focus\non with these\nmissions?\n\u201cSo, the Science\nMission directorate\nhas five science\ndivisions that\nit focuses on,\nobviously there is Planetary Science;\nEarth Science looking at our climate,\nstudying disasters, wildfires, storms;\nAstrophysics; Heliophysics; which\nis my favourite, and the fifth one is\nBiological and Physical Sciences. They\nhave the Cold Atom Lab operating at\nmicrogravity, super equipment, all the\nquantum stuff you guys did in your\nquantum physics exam \u2013 even stuff like\nillnesses and how you can cure them \u2013\nthere is a biological tie into the medical\nfield. Really, for us it is about taking\nadvantage of every situation to do as\nmuch science as possible.\n\u201cAs we do retire the ISS to our\ncommercial partners, there are a number\nof companies building commercial space\nstations for us to use.\u201d\nLone star: trailblazing as a\nwoman in STEM\nM: Women in NASA have had a\nlong and storied history, so how does\nit feel being a trailblazer \u2013 having been\nin the job for a few months after your\nfirst big mission?\n\u201cIt feels really good. I\u2019m really\nenjoying it. I sort of described it as equal\nparts excited and terrified.\u201d\nDr Fox is the second woman to hold\nthe position as Head of Science, the first\nbeing astronaut Mary\nCleave from 2005-2007.Sheishowever,\nthe first Brit.\n\u201cWe have a really\ndiverse culture here\nat NASA \u2013 there are\nalotofopportunities\nfor everybody, a\nlot of women in\nma na g em ent\npositions. I\nwas head of\nHeliophysics, and the\nperson acting for me\nrightnowisawoman.The\nhead of Planetary [Sciences]\nis a woman, the head of Earth\nSciences is a woman, the person\nacting for Biological and Physical\nSciences is also a woman.

However, if you harbour a\ncrippling fear of spiders, the first step to\novercomingitistointeractwithjumping\nspiders.\nI\u2019m not going to deny the reason these\nguys got their name \u2014 they can jump,\nand astonishingly well at that.

They either stay completely\nstill when waiting for prey or avoiding\ndetection, pace deliberately along bark,\nstone, or vegetation, or sprint away to\nglory. Jumpers, however, seem to think\nabout their movements. They walk a few\npaces, look around a bit, stare upwards,\nplay with their pedipalps (the little\nprojections near their head), and then\njump. If you\u2019ve ever let one walk on your\nfinger or even observed one outdoors,\nyou just know there\u2019s something going\non in that little brain of theirs. It has\nbeen proven through a whole host of\nstudies that jumping spiders are indeed\nintelligent, and that their situational\nawarenessandcapacitytothinkisalmost\nunparalleled among arthropods.\nIn tropical regions, there exists\nan extensive array of jumping spider\nspecies, and they are regular visitors to\nhouseholds, often hunting on the walls\nof houses for flies and mosquitoes.\nI\u2019ve even seen a wall jumping spider\n(Menemerus sp.) in Northeast India\nstalking prey on a light switch outside a\nrestaurant toilet. However, in the UK,\nweonlyhaveabout40speciesofjumping\nspiders, although that\u2019s not to say you\ncan\u2019t find them easily.

London is\nlucky to have several species, including\ntwo that are nationally scarce \u2014 the\nfencepost jumping spider (Marpissa\nmucosa) and the oak jumping spider\n(Ballus chalybeius).

    "content": "FRIDAY 26TH MAY 2023\n13\nMUSIC\nmusic.felix@imperial.ac.uk felixonline.co.uk\nIn 2020, Gorillaz infused a lot of fans with new optimism for the fictional band\u2019s future with Song Machine, Season One: Strange Timez after a set of bland\nand disappointing projects, like Humanz and The\nNow-Now. The record gave me hope that Damon Albarn might still not be past his creative prime, as he\nblessed us with a seriously impressive set of bangers\nwith exceptionally well-picked features and some love-ly, cartoonish Gorillaz beats. The marketing for Cracker Island hinted that the new album will be a return to\nform \u2013 a curious conceptual piece with oddly familiar aesthetics to their seminal record, Plastic Beach, as\nopposed to the array of disconnected songs that Song\nMachine gave us. What\u2019s not to be excited about?\nThe title track was the first one to drop, which set\nmy expectations quite high. \u2018Cracker Island\u2019 is a synthpop rager with a captivating, although repetitive, beat,\nlayered beautifully with Thundercat\u2019s dreamy vocals\nand Albarn\u2019s singing. Although the novelty does wear\noff after a while and the cut feels like it overstays its\nwelcome a bit, I was nonetheless really impressed.\nAnother single I was thoroughly enamoured by was\n\u2018Skinny Ape\u2019, which has some stunningly beautiful\nproduction, with pretty acoustic guitars and some\nsuper fun synths that suddenly disintegrate into this\nraging, distorted, and exhilarating thunderstorm\nnear the end. Though the build up to the incredibly\nsatisfying finish does drag on, I still adore nearly every\nsecond of the track.\nThe other singles, however, I was left feeling fairly\nindifferent towards. \u2018New Gold\u2019, which I initially\nliked, I think I ended up spinning two or three times\nbefore I got really bored with what the track had to\noffer. The prospect of a Tame Impala feature sounded\nexciting, but I was hoping for something bolder than\na mid-sounding deep cut\nfrom \u2018The Slow Rush\u2019,\nwith Bootie Brown\u2019s verse\nbeing dull and uninspired\nas hell. \u2018Baby Queen\u2019\nsounded a bit better, but it\nwas still rather forgettable\nand sleepy. If you asked\nme to recall its hook, I\nwould probably fail every\ntime. \u2018Silent Running\u2019 was\narguably the largest, most\ncommercially-targeted\ndrop, but I found it rather\nannoying from the get-go due to the incredibly basic\nsynth production and Albarn\u2019s slightly obnoxious\nvocal delivery. It felt like he was attempting to\nexpand his singing range far above what his voice can\nhandle, with the end product sounding awkward and\nunpleasant. He\u2019s really no David Bowie and he seems\nto be strikingly unaware of that.\nStill, given my positive feelings towards \u2018Cracker\nIsland\u2019 and \u2018Skinny Ape\u2019, I went into the project with\nan open mind. Unfortunately, what I got was exactly\nwhat I expected the worst case scenario to sound like.\nBoring, bland and lazy synth pop with little to no\ncharacter or replay value. I\u2019ll begin by praising one\ndeep cut that I actually enjoyed a fair amount, which\nis the Stevie Nicks feature titled \u2018Oil\u2019. The track is not\ntoo out of left-field or creative in what it\u2019s trying to\ndo, but I found the synth lines to be quite engaging\nand pleasant, while I enjoyed Stevie\u2019s vocals, as well\nas the way they were edited and harmonised with\nAlbarn\u2019s. The remainder of the track list, however,\nmade me feel like I\u2019m at the most uneventful summer\nvacation of my life, probably with my 80-year-old\ngrandparents, waiting for the 14 days to pass by until\nI can go home. \u2018The Tired Influencer\u2019 has redeeming\nqualities, as I do enjoy moments on it, but it still just\nfeels like listening to a Bikini Bottom transition cut\nfrom Spongebob over and over again while being half\nasleep. \u2018Tarantula\u2019 is even more annoying than \u2018Silent\nRunning\u2019 in terms of Albarn imagining to be a vocalist\nextraordinaire, with his singing of \u201cI need you, I need\nyou, I need you, I need youuuu\u2026\u201d making me cringe\nreally hard and press skip immediately every time.\nThe beat reminds me of airplane music that plays after\nyou land while the airport staff wishes you a pleasant\nstay in an exceptionally depressing Eastern European\ncity. And, as a Serbian, trust me \u2013 the airplane landing\nsoundtracks are generic and mind-numbing.\n\u2018Tormenta\u2019 may be my least favourite moment,\nas I actually actively dislike it as opposed to feeling\nindifferent to its presence in the track list. It strikes\nme as Damon Albarn making an obnoxious reggaeton\ntrack purely so he can have Bad Bunny on it rather than\nactually wanting to make a diversion in that direction\nand choosing Bad Bunny as a suitable feature to\ncomplement that. The closer \u2018Possession Island\u2019 is quite\nunderwhelming too, with some inoffensive but slightly\nboring piano melodies and a sax section near the end\nthat is not really fitting or in any way a cathartic way to\nwrap the album up.\nIf I had to summarise it, Cracker Island has the same\nvibe of my iPhone alarm tone after I\u2019ve pressed snooze\non it seven times and contextualised all the noises\ncoming from it within some weird, oddly non-specific\ndream narrative that I instantly forget after I wake\nup. I could also see it playing in a Primark changing\nroom inside the Gorillaz universe, while Demon Days\nand Plastic Beach are being blasted on full volume in\nall the cool venues and bars across the city. Two or\nthree bangers and straight skips in-between. Whilst I\ndo still hold hope for Albarn\u2019s creative output going\nforward, this may unfortunately be an indication\nthat he\u2019s running out of ideas, as I don\u2019t think I can\nlisten through another uninspired concept album like\nthis. Hopefully, Song Machine, Season Two doesn\u2019t\ndisappoint.\nGorillaz Release\nCracker Island\nThat whole final section was so good, and she ended with \u2018Feels Right\u2019, another groovy song with a catchy\nbaseline. This was one of the songs I remember from\nher opening in Ally Pally, but, hey, it was even better\nthanthefirsttime.Theenergyatthispointwasthrough\nthe roof, and I was overheating and out of breath (but\nsomehow still standing). She exited at this point, but\neveryone was still so crazy.\nOkay, I lied, she hadn\u2019t finished just yet. \u2018Kerosene\u2019,\nalso from her debut album, was her \u2018for real\u2019 closer. As\nall big oil fans know, kerosene is a very good (crowd)\nfuel. This song exudes the feeling of want and lust for\na person, right there, and right now. Again, was not\nexpecting to mosh, but here we were absolutely going\nthrough it.\nAll in all, Biig Piig had blown my expectations away.\nIt was pretty dope to see just how far she\u2019s come in her\nstagepresenceandmusic.It\u2019ssocooltoseeanartistlike\nherself come into her own, and I\u2019m really looking forward to see what she fills her set with next time I see\nher live.\nP.S. I ended up getting the set list - take a look at the\nSpotify playlist picture. If I look mildly concerning in\nthe photo it\u2019s because the person taking it told me to\npretend I was taking a prison mug shot.\nThe soundtrack to your most\nuneventful family holiday.\nMatija Conic Music Writer\nAlbum Review\n\n"

    "content": "It all began with a lil\u2019 day trip to Amsterdam Zuid,\nwhere I met up with the boyfriend and his friends, had\nsome pancakes, and went to a flea market (where there\nwere no fleas?!). We then headed to Melkweg. For the\nuninitiated, this translates to \u2018Milkyway\u2019, which is an\nappropriate name for a former dairy factory \u2013 how\ncool is that?\nWe saw the sign \u201cBiig Piig - Sold Out\u201d as we walked\nin. This was about to be a great night. We shoved our\ncoats into some lockers and entered the concert space.\nIt was well-ventilated, although a tad smaller than\nI expected, which could just be a side effect of never\nwearing my glasses (I\u2019m short-sighted). We grabbed\nsome drinks and it was all setting up to be a great\nnight. As this was happening, the opening act started\njamming. It was Anna-Rose Clayton, a self-proclaimed\n\u2018weirdo that loves writing songs\u2019.\nShe captivated the audience with her sheer energy,\ndespite some kinda weird lyrics. At one point I believe\nshe sang something about Obama? But I\u2019m willing\nto admit I might be wrong as the vodka-lemonade\nwhich I had consumed was particularly strong (and a\ndouble or more). I was a big fan of the instrumentals\nfrom Clayton. The drums felt like they could\u2019ve been\npre-programmed, but it was just the drummer playing\nfantastically.Whilstthelyricscouldbeimprovedupon,\nClaytonsuremadeupforitwithherband\u2019smusicalvirtuosity and her energy \u2013 she even came down to the pit\nand went apeshit with us whilst her band jammed out.\nFor a taste of her music check out \u2018nEw Me\u2019!\nNext up, the gig I\u2019d been so looking forward to. Ever\nsince I saw her opening for Glass Animals a couple\nof years ago, I knew Jessica Smyth, more commonly\nknown as Biig Piig, was one to watch.\nHer band entered the stage: a bassist/keys/saxo-phonist, a keys/guitarist, and a drummer. (apologies\nfor not remembering the names of Jess\u2019s bandmates\n- I blame getting hit in the head while we moshed \u2013\nbut more on that later). Their first song, \u2018This Is What\nThey Meant\u2019, describes the feeling of experiencing the\ncity through someone else\u2019s eyes; a groovy bop that got\neveryone dancing almost immediately. One thing I did\nnotice was that she was particularly jumpy. Not in the\neasily-startled way, but the jumping up and down way.\nShe had even more energy than her opener and it was\nhonestly really cool to see.\nThey played through a particularly funky slew of\nsongs, which reminded Smyth of her youth and the dif-ferenceinheroutlookatthetimeshewrotethesesome-what older songs. Although expected, she punctuated\nmultiple songs with bars in espa\u00f1ol and reminded me\nhow versatile her lyricism can be. \u2018Roses and Gold\u2019 had a\nparticularly thumping bass line, perfect for her guitarist to absolutely spit all over with a solo.\nThe middle section consisted of a more indie/bed-room pop feel, which was less energetic but more intimate than the previous songs. Even if I wasn\u2019t as big\na fan of this, it was still a great part of her discography\nto see live. \u2018Oh No\u2019 was particularly enjoyable with its\nstripped back nature, allowing Biig Piig\u2019s voice to carry\nthe song.\nWith every middle, there is, of course, an end. And\nthe end was bloody great. Biigus Piigus picks it up\nagain with \u2018Picking Up\u2019 from her new album. It starts\noff all mellow, and gradually turns up bit by bit until\nthe pre-chorus, where a chopped guitar sample enters\nand fully brings up the energy. At this point we were\nall jumping just like she was. She follows this up with\n\u2018Switch\u2019 and \u2018FUN\u2019 \u2013 both heavily influenced by Jungle\n- and boosts the energy in the room to new heights.\nYou could even say she switch-ed it up. If you\u2019ve ever\nlistened to any of Jess\u2019 discography, you would probably never expect to mosh to it. But it was so hype we all\neventually just got into it and did. Amsterdam mosh-ing was pretty fucking good, despite getting elbowed\non the head a couple of times. I blame this on the fact\nthat I\u2019m a short, short man.\n12 music.felix@imperial.ac.uk felixonline.co.uk\nEdited by: Joe Riordan\nTara Palchaudhuri\nMusic\nBiig Piig\u2019s Biig\nBubblegum\n2023 Tour\nGig Review\nKEEP THE CAT FREE\nIrish neo-soul singer, Biig Piig brings her\nunique brand of bedroom pop to OZ Hall, in\nMelkweg, Amsterdam.\nJohn Estopen Music Writer\nDon\u2019t Miss the Gig\nAn Evening with Gabriels @ Union Chapel,\nFriday 7pm 25th August\nGabriels, in their nascency, took\nustosmokyjazzbarswithsinister\nbrass and string sections that\nbackgroppedJacobLusk\u2019ssoulful\nvocals.
