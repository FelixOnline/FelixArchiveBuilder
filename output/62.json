    "content": "FELIX NELSON'S COLUMN All users of the Guilds and Union Libraries will be sorry to heart nat Miss Prat, the Assistant to Mr. James, is leaving. Miss Prat graduated at Q.M. J, in1948 with a First in Mathematics, and has spent three years in the Guilds Library, w ne re her efficiency, helpfulness and charm have\ncontributed in' no small way to the reputation w n ich the Library enjoys. her new appointment is as\nDo ou mentalist at trie French Air Ministry in Paris \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 *\nA summary of council proceedings will now be put up\non the council notice board ( in the old lounge) soon after council meetings.\n* \u00bb \u00bb * *\nWe would like to point out that thee\nscaffolding around the Albert Memorial has not been erected by members of I.C.,** \u00bb * \u00bb\nLast Friday evening, the Mountaineering Club held its Annual Dinner in the Upper Dining Hall. Thirty members, including5 ex presidents and numerous beards, attended. The main proceeding, however, took place in the Union Entrance Hall where members of the Club carried on the tradition of traversing the aforementioned Hall. Several attempts were\nmade and most of the\" climbers\" succeeded at the expense of a couple of noticeboards, an\nelectric light and some beer glasses. MOTOR CLUB RALLY A driver, at the finish of the Guilds Motor Clubs' Spring Rally, was heard to remark, \"Luoky\nthe club made us sign an indemnity at the start!\" This gives some indication of the adventures that befell those taking part in this event on the last Sunday of the Spring Term.\nThe start was a tI.C. Union and the first comp et it or was away at2.00 p.m. An average speed\nof27 m.p.h. was stipulated for most of the entries and this was checked at various points on the route. One of these check points was after a ford near Burnt Mill. It was not absolutely necessary to go through the ford but of the54 competitors only12 e leo ted to avoid it. John Wheatcroft( Guilds) was one of the first to reach the ford and the entry of his Austin sixteen into the water was as befitted a car driven by the vice commodore of I.C. sailing club. One\nwitness said that the bow wave passed over the roof of his car: On arrival at the other side the engine ceased and frantic drying of various engine components was necessary before continuing. Another competitor John Bid good had\ntrouble of another sort at this checkpoint. After having his instruction sheet signed by the course steward, it was carried away by a glam o rous young lady to the wrong car and never seen again. The final check point was Matching Green,\nbut before starting on the return journey, comp et it or s had to follow a route card in reverse involving the detection of several places of liquid refreshment. The return to London involved visiting various map references and collecting\" treasure\". One item of\" treasure\" was a slit inner tube. About a dozen competitors were apprehended\" borrowing\" old tractor tyres from a Massey Harris depot. \u2022\nYE Zit R!O'l'f? V \u00a3 2 6 S NACH BP IIS A FOR O'j The winner of the rally was Dr. A. E. Hunt,\nof London Hospital,( Ford Ten) who suffered a puncture but managed to change the wheel in3 minutes dead. After some re calculations Dave\nPenny ( Guilds) was declared2 nd. London Hospital took3 rd and 4 th places thus assuring them of the first team place. A Guilds team was seo on d and third came a<i.M. C. team.\nPROFILED. J. POWER\nIf you are a regular hop-goer, you will have noticed\na band of select persons always sitting on the edge of the\nstage. Periodically, one of them gets up, collects all their pots - all of them have pots, incidentally - goes\ndownstairs and comes back with .more refreshment. More\noften than not, this refreshment-be get ter is Derek Power,\na handsome blok e with deceptively innocent blue-green eyes\nand a soothing, mellow voice. Derek, or Di j as he is commonly called, is also this year's Chairman of the Athl e tic Clubs Committee.\nOn coming to I.C. in1950 he showed great skill in hockey and squash. A couple of years ago he was the\nmainstay of our hockey team together with Brian Purslow.\nA FSLIX report in early '52 says \"....dour midfield play\nwith Power and Purslow thrust ful in attack, and Purslow\nand Power dogged in defence ....(J.G. Smith) well supp-lied the. ammunition for the Pnrslow-Power spearhead.\"\nThe report is signed \"D.J. P;B. W.P.\" He has recently\nbeen seen in a half-purple tie, presumably acquired on tha\nU.L. hockey team's right wing this season. In squash\nDerek's name can be seen resting comfortably at -she top of\nthe ladder throughout the season.\nAfter a successful season as Hockey Captain, it was not\nsurprising to see him as the Chairman of the A.C.C. His ' outstanding achievement in that post must surely be\nthe new scheme for teas at Harlington. For all the criticism it has aroused, the tremendous organisation that went\ninto the scheme has definitely paid off in greater numbers\nusing the coaches and staying on for teas at Harlington.\nDerek's other activities are too numerous to detail. He was Guilds Vice-President last year, can be seen at\nCarnivals in a Spanish hat, was instrumental in getting\nBeaver from L.S. S. this year, and dived (voluntarily)\nin the Serpentine in the February rag.\nIt is surprising how his third floor colleagues la the Old Hostel refuse, with one voice, to profile him or\nto divulge any damaging information. Derek's own idea of\nhis Profile was a heading and a photograph at the top, half a column of empty space and two words at the bottoms\n\"Interests: women.\"\nRUSSIAN SALAD\" Russian Salad, or Hammer v ourS loKi e\" \u00abas,\nto say t ne least of it, arn v felt:. e me for a carnival. For all its long-winded.o.e8 B,it told people precious little about w nat to wear . AS it turned out, most of t ne male joy-r. ur.ter s turned out in some form of fur caps, bear i3, or tr.e oli faithfuls, Mines rug gers nir ts(a3 wi -..less tr.=s photographs now on exhibition in t ne er.-.raja oe hall). The female hunters I mean j oy-r.unt ers turned up as carrots, peas or ot nerf orr of horticultural growths. Frantic preparations went an till late tn at evening, and the Carnival probably no Ids t ne record forgetting off to a late start. There\nwere three repeat, three couples around at about10, while by about11 all hell was let loose, glasses and bottles were inactive circulation and the Gym and Upper Dining Hall was a seething mass of humanity. Out of the hazy recollections of your correspondent one memory shines through,\" his was the\njazz band that came on as guest artists fort ne Cabaret and later on played in the lower entr ance hall. The latter was transformed into a really wonderful place, the only light filtering in through the windows, smoke rising from all over the place, this little band playing really divine music and a knot of app re cia; ive people listening in fascination, as in a trance. Time\npassed, and eventually left only the debris as a reminder of Russian Salad, the best Carnival this correspondent can recall. EMS**** A few seats available for the final meeting of\nthe campaign on May 22nd at3p. m.att f hit e City Stadium. Do not miss this final opportunity of hearing Dr. Graham. Tickets( Free) can\nbe obtained from John Bromley, ChemTech or any\nmember of ICCU.\n\n"

The outward journey was made in high spirits and the crossing favoured by a calm sea and bright sunshine. Two matches were played against Ville ju if, and both were won, 19-6 and 18-5. The first match was played before a crowd of about three thousand on the principal afternoon of the festival. The ground was bone hard, and with a light ball the game was fast and open. I.C. pro duo ed their very best form and opened up a Be ries of brilliant passing. movements in wh i oh both bao ks and forwards combined with equals kill and zest. Particularly thrust ful were Lewis, Hy kin, and guest player Stan Coppelman, a sterling servant of the Club in previous years, who\nInspired delighted shouts of \"Le petit!\" from the crowd. Armstrong, Corbett and Hy well Jones were always up with the play and were all re war ded by fine tries. The French team were good\nindividually but la oke d effective combination. However, they played the game in an excellent spirit. In the second game, I.e. again played very well after the early shook of being three points down. Before the match, the captain, D.Hy kin, was presented with a large bouquet by the local Mayoress, and rose nobly to the occasion with the traditional continental embrace. All the I.C. party played in one game and ten of them\nplayed in both. Attempts to hold conversations in French varied astonishingly with different members of the party._ Uan Fowler indulged in some splendid French, tinged unashamedly with his inimitable accent. C oppel man. expected Frenchmen to' understand English, provided he put emphasis on\ndifferent syllables and was righteously indignant when they did not. Elliott was just hope-less, and never got what he wanted.\nThis looked like being an absurdly sober tour, apart from a short contest between McCann\nand Armstrong on the one hand, and ' V in blanc' on the other. The latter won by administering a knockout to both challengers. However, the lost time was made good by some members of the party by the simple expedient of not going to bed at all on the last night, spending it instead in the company of one ' Charlie' in his Bar in Montparnasse, and in the nightclub next door. We escaped from this without loss of life and were able to countenance the invigorating return crossing confident that we could relapse into unconsciousness at a moment's notice. L C.W&C rW it nu hex r usual good nature, a number of our members have al lov^ed themselves to be ' persuaded' into doing Athletics this week. We are defending our two cups against unknown opposition but we are hoping for the best. Supporters for Saturday, May 8 th,2.30 p.m. at Mot spur Park, would be very welcome.\nSaturday, May 1 st, was a great day for another seo tion, the much discussed Rowing Club. On that day, the girls had their first practice at the U.L. Boat house. Their coach for the moment is Miss E. Bly den stein, who has had much\nexperience at Amsterdam University. Two members, one in cricket and one in tennis, are attending U.L. trials. The tennis VI are strong this year, and have more than the usual number of players from wh i oh to select. Weather permitting, we look forward to a very successful and varied Summer term.\npublished by the FLUX Boara, Impcial College Onm, tendon. 9. W.7 Pouted i>y S tl Vim Has Ltd., ,2, Exhibition Rd..

After conversion this performed remarkably and arrived In Liverpool in fine style. The boat crossing was not as rough as had been feared, but there was a shortage of berths, and only half a night's sleep was obtained. Luckily there was no racing on the first day,\nso the boats were quietly rigged in Dun\nLa og hal re Harbour for the Easter weekend\nracing. Altogether ten races were sailed, the first four being for the An To stal Shield which was\nawarded to the boat scoring the most points. The opposition was pretty stiff, including the Irish Olympic helmsman at Helsinki, and the wind was light and variable on both days. This made\nconditions rather difficult for the I.C. boats and they did well to place4 th,5 th, and7 thin a fleet of nearly twenty. The remainder of the races were matches\nagainst Trinity College, Dublin, the National University of Ireland and the Royal College of Surgeons, Ireland.\"1 Tne\"w iha had increased in strength, making local knowledge less important and ea oh. match was won convincingly. On the\nstrength of this, the team was presented with a half pint pot each and proceeded to oh r is ten same\nat a party given by the Trinity boys in whose\nrooms the team were staying. With Guinness at\nl/6da pinta good time was had by all, and the\nparty only came to an end when the Commodore\nwas tu oke d down in a sail in the later hours of the morning,\nATHLETICS in a match at H arlington on Saturday, May\nthe first, Birmin^tam University beat Imperial\nCollege by 8 4 & points to54 i. A fairly strong wind helped the hurdles and 100 yards, but\nimpeded the other races. The I.C. team was,\nunfortunately, depleted, as a result of the\nLondon University v. Paris University, in wh i oh most of our best men took part. GOLFING NEWS The Spring Meeting of the Golfing Association was held at Ash ridge Golf club on Monday April26 tl when 12 members competed for the numerous prizes. Although nearly6500 yards long the Course was\nplaying short and the greens were very firm and fast,, wh i oh made putting somewhat difficult.

    "content": "FELIX LETTERS TO THE EDITOR\nDear Sir,I would like too on ment on the inclusion in your last issue of a report on the Choir Concert. Since Felix was, in fact, printed before the Conc ert took place, it is difficult to see how the\nreview cou id have been an honest account of the\nproceedings, unless Felix has invested in a crystal ball in order to make such forecasts. I feel that this type of anticipation is nauseating in the extreme, and I am sorry that Felix should have descended to such a practice. Please restrict the use of the past tense to events)\nwhich have, in fact, occurred. Yours sincerely, E.J. Guthrie. Dear Sir, In t ne last issue of FELIX appeared a report of t neo u o ir concert. This surprised me since I\"i nave never seen so many students so quiet\" j om men ted a member of I.C. teaching staff, after the Billy Graham Albert Hall meeting on Maroh 2 j th. It was the first time in the history of the Hall that it had been hire a by Imperial College societies( I.O.C. U. and I, 'rj. S. C.M.), and t ne2,500 students who attended were a reassuring spectacle to those who organized t ne meeting. After a few wise or a ok s, Billy began with a survey of the spiritual history of America its godly beginning, gradual apostasy, and subsequent moral decline. He then described the recent return to religion on the part of both intellectuals and common people, and stated that it was beginning to influence profoundly every area of national life. Tne trouble with the world, said Billy was\nthat it was full of human beings. He believed SUA Fi LIX being brought into Guilds before the oho ir that the only power which could remake human nature concert began. I was even more amazed to see that tn eF S LIX account was so true a report of the proceeding*. It was t ne first time that I have read a review of ac noir concert with any interest and further examples of this progressive journalism woj ld be appreciated, especially if dealing with horse ruc ii g, the stock exchange etc A. W00LLAST0N - GUILDS.\nDear Sir, In the last edition of Felix we were surprised to read that \"The Art Club hopes to have\nsome excursions into three dimensions, though lack of talent in scripture is at the moment a serious stumbling block.\" As Secretary of the I.C.C. UI am very pleased to be able to offer the services of many of our n embers who'would be willing to coach members of the Art Club in scripture, free of charge. Should any artist da .J ire to hear lectures on scripture ha is cordially invited to attend our Bible Studies held in Roam 101 Chem. Tech. on Thursdays during the lunch hour.\nNo doubt members of the Christian Union previously unaware of the great value of scripture in3 dimensional art will have been busy at this latter oo e tip atl on during the vacation. Yours sincerely, John Bromley.( Sec. ICCU)\nDear Sir, ;\nI would like to ask when an official announcement Is to be mete about the forthcoming alterations to the Union\npremises. These building activities will probably affect\nmore mae r graduates than the larger scale alterations to be made to the College blocks.\nSurely a comer of tho pall of secrecy can be lifted to throw some light on this matter by a few words from the\npowers that be.\nAlready too much important news finds its way around\nthe College by rumour; so that if we are going to lose the\nroof of the Gym this term, let us at least know when.\nYours faithfully, J.S. Seeley.\nKDITOR'S NOTE: FELIX has been endeavour ing to publish news\nabout the reconstruction for a very long time. As far back as February we announced that \"A description of the new\nbuildings will appear in FELIX in the very near future\"\nbut publication was delayed because the licence for the work\n'had not then been granted.\nAt present tenders are being invited for the work but\nthe architects plans, in the possession of the administration department, are thought to be too misleading for FELIX to use. The Clerk to the Governors is now trying to\narrange for a diagram of the layout of the new building Cor\nInclusion In the next FELIX. Meanwhile, a summary of the news now circulating around the union, is gi men elsewhere in this issue.\nDear Sir,I was interested to notice in the top right-hand\ncorner of the Sports Page of the last issue of \"Felix\"\n.\n-. representation of that worthy feline imbibing from\na pot and carrying a placard reading \"Bar Race\". I, and, I am sure, many others, would be Interested to\nknow what, exactly, this event is. Yours sincerely,\nAd Inebriate\"7 ITOR'S NOTEI Tho Bar Race is the last event in tho I.C. Cross-Country season. It commences at the\nradiator by the Club notice-board, and runs across the\nEntrance-Hall and into tho Bar. A pint of bitter, already set up, is then consumed at optimum rate, and\nthe journey back to the bar is repeated\nwas the redeeming power of Christ. This he illustrated from his own experience, mentioning in particular the problem of race relations.? Inclosing he outlined the steps by wh i oh this redemptive change came about first, the admission of failure and sinfulness, and second, an a otl ve faith in Christ as Saviour and Lord. General reaction to the meeting has been very favourable. It cleared away considerable prejudice against Graham, and excited much discussion of his message. As one student commented - \"The\nwhole College is talking religion!\" After Dr. Graham's address Felix interviewed a selection of I.C. student B who were at the Albert Hall. Their opinions are in o lude d below. . -One student said this: I fully agreed with Billy Graham. There will a j wy s be trouble and misery inthe world until man realises iv' Is not economic or political change which Is the sola tia* but a change from with ii rj and that can only be b roo hgt about by Jesus Christ.\nAnother student expressed his\" disappointment aa follows: in spite of his excellent presentation, Billy Graham's address in the Albert Hall was extremely disappointing.\nIt was not at all inspiring, the speaker at the Mission\nlast year being far more convincing, and he seemed to be\npreaching Morality, far more than live Christianity, making\nno direct appeal to his audience other than thou-ht ful consideration of his remarks. Those of us who have been\n! already stirred to consider Christianity by the work of\nI.C.C. U. came away with a sense of disappointment.\nThe above statement is in marked contrast to the following impression:, Dr. Graham placed his emphasis on personal spiritual communion with Christ rather than on the moral virtues\nof Christianity. While the purifying value, Individually,\nof such spiritual experience, or its power, collectively, cannot be denied, its relation to a real Deity, as conceived of by Christians, Is open to some question in view of the fact that similar experience is claimed by\ndevotees of other religions.\nA more materialistic view was expressed ap\nfollows: rill those present at the Albert Hall, regardless of\ntheir religious beliefs, admit that Dr. Billy Graham is an impressive and almost overwhelming speaker. Although\nhe may not have converted everybody there to practising\nChristianity, he achieved great success in that he\ncaused the student B to think seriously and maturely about\nthe present state of world affairs, and the possible\ncures. And by doing this, I think he helped the cause\nof Peace.\nif AND DO YOU CONSIDER YOUR GRANT TO BE\nENOUGH FOR A FAIR STANDARD OF LIVING ?\n\n"

Whether due to bad advertising or to a general apathy on the port of the student\nbody, tho attendance wa.i. fer less than might have been, but\nas this resulted In mon free beer (and older) for those\nwho did come, no complaints on this account were voiced\nalthough the organisers may have been a little disappointed. The proceedings started with a surprising lack of\nspirit shown by R. CS. when o all ed upon to eject C. and 0.\ngate-or as her s but this was probably due to their customary restraint backed by tho knowledge that having triumphed\ny in the matter of the Spanner, they oo ul d afford to be lenient.\nAfter this we were treated to a series of songs and sketches,\nmoot of the usual student standard and with usual student\nleaning towards the bawdy expressed in various ways.\nParticular attention may bo drawn to the duet by \"Jim and\nlio bin\" which was quite the finest and most polished item in the programme, the oxo ol lent duo logue by the P.O. chemist a and also their skit on the Board of Studios enlivened by\nartistic photographs, and the very good impromptu performances by the Presidents of the Mines and the C. and 0.\nTh* organisers showed initiative in ome ring the various items, so that as tho party Bseame more noisy, their attention was still hold to the stage. The chief complaint was on this matter of no lse i one was forced either to\nait near the front away from the beer and hear all that\nwas going on, or to stay at the tack and drink so much that\none no l unger oared.\nIn spite of the larger supply of beer than usual, it unfortunately ran out Just past ths Interval, but this was\nto b \u00ab expected. On this matter, did the performers really\nrequire several barrels to themselves?\nSeveral members of I. C.W.

Circulation i1150 It ana often been Mid that I.C. is too far\nfrom tha cent ra of London to be as wall known as it might. We, being members of I.C., tend to overlook the\nfact that others have never even heard of it. London is too large for anyone to know every part but one would\nhave thought that London Transport should kno* ua wall\nenough to know that we exist in South Kensington.\nYat what do we find on tha street maps\nadorning the walla o the Undargxound? Guilds and Mines\nare marked as the Imperial Institute, R.C.S is indicated\nas part of the Victoria& Albert Museum and the Science\nVlusaum. Laasar place a in The Strand and Sower Street\nare indicated. .Vhy not I.C.? There is one obvious remedy - provide each\nmember of the union with a large red pencil but there\nmust be a way to rectify this omission wh i oh would be\nmore satisfactory to all concerned.\nAnother caa e for action of some sort or another\nis in the matter of preserving ourselves in our journeys\nup and down Exhibition Road. Comparatively few of us\ncan live in the hostel and many have to risk crossing\nCromwell Road and Thurlpe Place. Of late, the tendency\nof traffic to swing into these roads, from Exhibition\nRoad, without giving signals of any kind, has increased.\nThere is the alternative of using the subway\nbut no one should be forced to burrow beneath the ground\ninstead of enjoying the fresh (comparatively) air above.\nThe road a around I.C. are wide enough for the traffic to\ntravel reasonably quickly and still6 ive us ac nance to\ncross the roads in safety. Hence it appears that the so\nsolution lies in educating the motorists. There's scope\nfor someone here'.\n\" PERSONAL\" ADVERTISEMENTS TOR SALS S Retina, f3.5.35m m.C.R. Shutter, 1/500.\n3.R.

The ground floor will remain substantially the same, but extra cloakroom space will be made available b,, removing the bar to a posi*tion now occupied by the committee rooms and\nI.C. W.A.A new building will be e reo ted between\nthe present union and the botany building. A large committee room will occupy the ground floor of this building. The upper dining hall will remain un alter ed, but there will be two rooms instead of the\npresent gym. One will be known aa a staff common\nroom, hut will be available for receptions, etc.. The present staff common room will be used as an\nextension to the kitchen premises.\nTwo new floors will be added. The concert\nhall will be on the East side of the 2nd floor, with raised stage, dressing rooms and storage\nspace. The new gym will be on the West side\nwith rv hong H ng rooms f or men and women at the extreme end. These will be accomodate d one above\nthe other. Stairways will be provided at both\nends of the union in addition to the existing cent ral staircase. This latter will reach the 2nd floor an the South side, and the dividing wall will be such as to allow the gym and concert hall to be made into one large room.\nAnother refectory will occupy the 3rd floor above the new gym, and it is expected that\nthis will offer cafeterias er vio e. On the East\nside there will be a games room and writing room.\nSo definite date has been announced for commencing work, but it is expected to start be fore the end of the term. The duration of work\nis. not known, but it is probable that it will be\nabout 3 years, sino e work is to oe arranged to\nallow continual student use of part of the Union.\nQueenies may be used for hops but this will be\nsubject ta various conditions. GRANTS The working committee of the London area grants survey\n(on which Sick Jaaaa, the Mines president, was representing I.C., in the University Colleges section) decided to\napply for a hearing with L.C.C. and suggested a date early\nin May. Among the problems for discussion, those peculiar\nto University Colleges were vacation courses and tha expenses\nincurred therein.\nThis move was the result of the questionnaires sent\nround several colleges. At I.C. only 571 out of about\n1600 students completed questionnaires. This made it impossible to break the information down into courses, years,\nparents' income etc. The following table shows the distri'bution of those co-operating.\nYear\n1st2 nd3 rd P.G.

In the old lab. the other day, I came across an old wooden case, its top locked with\na huge wooden padlock but the hinges gone, so that\nit opened from the other side instead. Inside was\na mass of old papers, some pinned together, others\njust floating about. They turned out to be the Union\nTreasurer's records for about 1928-35. Too eager\nto feel guilty, I began to browse.\n\"Dear Sir\" a letter ran, \"We herewith return\nyour cheque for \u00a38, as the account has already been\nsettled by XXX. We hope you find everything to be\nin order.\" A very optimistic hope, it turned out.\nThe very next letter was from the Amateur Fencing Assn., mildly but firmly reproving in tone.\nThe season was well advanced it said, but the I.C. Fencing Club had not yet paid its affiliation fees.\nWould the Hon. Sec. in question take the necessary\nsteps. I can just see the Hon Trees, reminding the\nHon Sec, who would then approach the Hon. Treas.\nofficially and request mm, as the person in charge\nof the cash, to forward (the necessary fees on his( the Hon. See's) behalf, necessary adjustments to\nthe Club's account with the Union to be made in due\ncourse. This is known as working through the proper\nchannels.\nThe Morphy. Dinner in'29 was held on the 13th March. Its bill came to s6*7 guests h/ head,\nO.7.8.0; wines and cigars for guests \u00a32.1.1; breakages \u00a31.8.5. Things were cheap in those days.\n11 cars were \"completely re leather ed\" for only\n\u00a31.2.0. BUt then there was a bill from an Eton inn,\ncharging the boat club IV a head for bed and break-fast. This was in'29. Most have been a terrific place.\nThe letter that really appealed to me, though,\nwas an humble request, addressed to the Hon. Treas.\nCould she, the ICWA Treasurer timidly asked, \"please\nhave the money allotted by the Union to ICWA for Session 1928-29, t fce amount being \u00a35 ?\" I hope\nshe got it. Magnus.\n\n"
