    "content": "FELIX Friday 18 March 2011 23\nARTS\nEstorick: The little Italy hidden away in Islington\nRafael Benitez Cabral\nCanonbury Square, postcode N1, is not\nmy usual haunt on a Wednesday after-noon. I have navigated my way here\nfrom Highbury & Islington station and\narrived in front of a handsome Georgian\nhouse on the square where George Orwell once lived.\nThe Estorick Collection is a small\nmuseum of modern Italian art whose\npermanent collection includes works\nby Balla, Boccioni and Modigliani, but\nI am here to visit the temporary exhibition From Morandi to Guttuso. The\nforty selected pieces provide a comprehensive overview of Italian Modernism,\nfrom Futurism and Scuola Metafisica to\nNovecento and Corrente.\nOn entering the exhibition, I was\ndrawn to a meditative still life in earthy\ntones by Giorgio Morandi which shows a\nwill to communicate the magic and poetry of ordinary objects. Initially, I was un-derwhelmed by Gino Severini\u2019s small-sized Window with Pigeons (c.1930-31).\nI later learned that Severini started his\nartistic career in the pre-World War II\nyears as a Futurist, insisting on the centrality of modern subject matter and sen-sations. The piece strikes me as being\nthe perfect embodiment of the \u201creturn to\norder\u201d phenomenon, whereby artists of\nthe inter-war years abandoned the iconoclasm of pre-war artistic currents and\nshifted focus to more traditional subject\nmatter. Giorgio de Chirico\u2019s Les bains\nmyst\u00e9rieux (c. 1934-36) then caught my\neye and instantly became a personal fa-vourite. Part of a series, it reveals an enduring fascination with the iconography\nof classical antiquity.\nAs I proceeded to the next room, there\nwere some fine examples of works by\nItalian Futurist painters Enrico Prampolini and Fortunato Depero. I was struck\nby Prampolini\u2019s Synthesis of Taormina\n(1939), which aims to capture the drama\nof flight in its depiction of Mount Etna\nand small, historic Taormina at its feet.\nScantily-dressed women (1940) by Renato Guttuso, an exponent of Corrente,\nis visually engaging.\nThere I finished my visit. It is worth\nmentioning that Della Ragione donated\nhis extensive collection to the city of\nFlorence as a gesture of solidarity after\nthe devastating 1966 floods which carried away in its waters so many works\nof art. The collection was last exhibited\nfive years ago and had been in temporary storage. Whether you are Italian or\nnot, don\u2019t miss the chance to see masterpieces from a collection that has been\ninvisible for so long.\nTate Modern\u2019s blockbuster Orozco\nIs it worth going to see another exhibition full of quirky art put there just to\nleave the onlooker wondering how anyone can call it \u2018Art\u2019? Beyond the bewildering first impression, Orozco\u2019s exhibition at the Tate evokes a personal and\nsurreal world where playfulness comes\nside by side with death. On entering the\ngallery, you can find a primaeval clay\nheart made simply by the artist\u2019s hands\ncompressing a piece of mud. It has a\nsimple but powerful beauty to it.\nAnd rapidly the tone shifts \u2013 in the\nnext room, Black Kites (1997), a human\nskull meticulously decorated by the artist with a black chequered pattern stands\nin the middle of the room. Hung around\nthis image of death there are extracts\nfrom the obituaries of complete strangers published in the New York Times.\nSurrounded by such a display, I could\nnot avoid thinking what line would sum\nup my life. Will I ever have a line written for me, by those who remain alive\nafter my death?\nWalking on through the rooms, I\nfound myself in a floating graveyard.\nLintels (2001) is a collection of the\nlint left behind from the filters of drying machines. When approached closely\none can see the residues left, and even\nmake out strands of human hair. Though\nrepulsive at first, it leaves a more lasting\nimprint that invites a deeper reflection.\nThis piece, first displayed in the aftermath of 9/11, evokes a moving vision\nof a necropolis; imagine how striking it\nRoc\u00edo Molina Atienza could have been to those who had just\nexperienced death so closely. In contrast\nto this, the main room shows an eclectic\narrangement of pieces, much more up-beat. The walls of the room are covered\nby a series of photographs taken in Berlin, where the artist would stop whenever he saw a motorbike the same as his.\nOverall, I found that piece dull in the\nextreme, though together with the other\npieces in the room it conveyed a twisted\nversion of the industrialism that surrounds us. More engaging, was the artist\u2019s own reworking of a Citroen DS that\ndominated the room. The car had been\nsliced in three, the middle part taken out\nand reconstructed again to create a sleek\ncar reminiscent of Formula One.\nOther pieces in the room left me cold:\na random shoebox, remarkable only as\nhaving been used by artist, had been\nplaced on the floor, and not very far\naway there was an empty elevator compartment from a building in Chicago.\nNonetheless, there was in that room a\npiece that struck me: an arrangement of\nfour bikes modified such that they were\nattached to each other, like a twisting\nskeleton of worn out snakes biting each\nother\u2019s necks. Finally, from my visit,\none anecdote is fixed in my mind. \u201cCarambole with Pendulum\u201d is a twisted\ngame of billiards where the table is now\nelliptical, with no pockets and only three\nballs, one of which is hung by a pendulum from the ceiling. With cues stacked\nin the corner of the room, anyone can\npick one up and play, according to their\nown rules, this surreal game.\nAs I\u2019m standing there watching others play, a family enters - two children\nmouth-full of question followed by two\nparents. The girl, not older than seven,\nasks again and again if she can have her\ngo as her father starts playing with the\nballs and the cue as if he were the child.\nMeanwhile, the mother contents her\nwith some reasons of why it\u2019s not her\nturn. This little scene just got me thinking how conditioned most of us have\ngrown up to be, never daring to play after years of parental repression.\nArt is a way of demolishing these learnt\npreconceptions; it is an invitation to those\nwho dare to join the game of observing\nreality from a different angle and taking\npart in it. Orozco\u2019s exhibition is definitely\na good starting point to embark on this\ntrip \u2013 then again, it might just be a break\nfrom the adult world of Imperial life.\n\u201cArt is a way of\ndemolishing [...]\npreconceptions ... an\ninvitation to those\nwho dare to join the\ngame of observing\nreality from a\ndifferent angle\u201d Why always skulls? We get it already, it\u2019s just a dead person\u2019s head\nThese guys are heading off for a \u2018wash\u2019 in Les bains mysterieux\nWe ask whether this high-class freak show is more than the art of drawing crowds\nUntil 25th April at Tate Modern\nUntil 3rd April at Estorick\nGabriel Orozco \u2018Black Kites\u2019\n\n"

    "content": "FEATURES\n10 FELIX\nFriday 18 march 2011\nNightline: a last resort for many\nJulia Langer nudges alumni towards Memory Lane\nWe\u2019ve all heard the rumours about the\n\u2018real\u2019 reason why the Queen\u2019s Tower\ndoors remain shut for most of the year.\nRegardless of whether they are true, it\nis recognised that university life can be\nextremely stressful and that students are\na high risk group for suicide. In 1969, a\nstudy conducted with British and American students found \u201can unusually high\nrate of suicide among college students\u201d,\na fact still true today. This highlighted\nthe necessity of emotional support for\nstudents. Following a spate of suicides\nat Imperial College, in 1971 a small\ncollege-based project known then as\nWest London Nightline was born. Now\n40 years on, this registered charity (re-named London Nightline) offers confidential listening and support to students\nfrom all over London and Brighton. The\n60-70 active volunteers that work with\nthe charity \u2013 all of them students like\nyou \u2013 are there for students all night,\nevery night during term time. These volunteers would like their fellow students\nS\no I see the advert: \u201cStudent\nCaller Campaign For Annual Fundraising\u201d. In my\nhead I\u2019m thinking, \u201cYes!\nThis ticks a lot of boxes\u201d.\nLike many fellow Imperial students, my\nCV is too science-focused. I have got\nlots and lots of experience in labs but I\nfeel like I need some other type of work\nexperience to show I am an employable\nindividual.\nOne of the attractions of this campaign\nis that it\u2019s a chance to be a part of something positive and help future students\nstudying at Imperial. The perks: it pays\n\u00a37.50 per hour, it\u2019s compatible with my\nstudies, and it\u2019s only a four-week campaign so there is no long-term commit-ment. The campaign is raising funds for\nthree areas: the rector\u2019s fund, the student opportunities fund, and the junior\nresearch fellowship fund. So what did I\nlearn whilst being a student-caller on the\nfundraising campaign? This is my personal account.\nWhat do the alumni think of Imperial\n10, 30, or 50 odd years after graduating?\nThe majority spoke fondly of their time\nat Imperial. Almost immediately, many\nmentioned that they had to work hard,\nbut made life-long friends, and that their\ndegree from Imperial opened all kinds of\ndoors for them.\nIt was astonishing that what is essentially a cold-call could lead to a\n30-minute conversation with a complete\nstranger. Some alumni had very limited\ncontact with the college, but despite the\nyears that had passed since they last set\nfoot on campus, they warmed over the\nphone and told me of their personal ex-periences.\nWhat were the moments that they remember best? Many of the engineers\ntalked about the lack of female students\non their course. I spoke to one woman,\nwho had been one of only 41 female\nundergraduates at the time. A chatty\nphysicist remembers sitting in lectures\nwith Brian May, prior to his successful career as a musician with the band\nQueen. A post-war graduate described\nhow the student population changed\nfrom a predominantly British institution\nto a multi-cultural university. One of my\nfavourite stories was that of a 61 year-old physicist who attempted to climb\nthe Queen\u2019s Tower after a few beers too\nmany at the union bar. Then there was\nthe chemist who proudly claimed to be\nthe first Imperial graduate to get a \u201cpass\u201d\nas his final degree award. I learned about\nthe mysterious tunnels under the South\nKensington campus and of the College\u2019s\nhistory.\nIn addition to hearing the experiences\nof alumni, I was able to tell them about\nmy impression as a current Imperial\nto know that sometimes it\u2019s tough and\nthere are people who care.\nOriginally, Nightline was set up with\nthe help of the Samaritans with the aim\nof reducing suicides at university. However the service is not exclusively for\nthose suffering from depression or with\nsuicidal thoughts. Over the phone, via\nSkype, email and instant messaging,\nNightline volunteers will listen to any\ntopic you wish to talk about. It is not a\ncounselling service but provides an im-partial, non-judgemental and empathetic\near. Most of us have felt the daunting\nfeeling of moving to a new city where\nyou may not know anyone and have to\nnavigate for yourself. So Nightline provides information that could help with\ncommon student issues from taxi numbers to where to find an STI clinic or\nfinancial advice.\nImperial College is an institution\nwhich praises science and logical\nthought, but that doesn\u2019t mean we always master our emotions. The founding of Nightline offered a haven for\nstudents to talk freely about whatever\nweighed on their minds. Nightline was\na rapid success and within 4 years was\noffering the service to 20 colleges in\nWest London. Today, London Nightline runs at over 60 universities and\ncolleges, with a catchment exceeding\n300,000 students. However, the journey of Nightline has not always been\nsmooth. In 1986, it threatened closure\ndue to funding problems. At the time, IC\npaid the bill for the majority of the charity\u2019s costs and, although they were still\nhappy to provide accommodation and\nadministrative costs, they looked to other London universities to help contribute\nto Nightline\u2019s survival. Even today, the\ncharity relies on funding provided by affiliated colleges or universities and their\nstudent unions. Sadly in 1989, after 18\nyears of generous support from Imperial,\nNightline was forced to relocate to make\nspace for more student accommodation.\nAlthough the charity could no longer call\nImperial home, the college and union\nhave remained affiliates to this day.\nThe Independent reported in 2008 that\n\u201cmore than half of the students who went\nstudent, and issues, such as the funding\ncuts, that concern us as students. To my\nsurprise, some of the alumni were very\nwell informed on recent events and developments at Imperial. Alumni news-letters, emails, and fundraising events\nhave been a great way of maintaining\ncontact.\nWhilst most alumni reflected affectionately on their student days and wanted to give to the College, some were\npositively appalled at the idea of being asked to donate money. Comments\nranged from feeling no affiliation to the\nCollege, to alumni expressing that they\nhad an awful experience and that their\ntime at Imperial was the most stressful\nof their life.\nSo why is fundraising of such importance to Imperial? Most will agree\nthat actively calling alumni appears to\nbe a rather American strategy, and perhaps even a bit aggressive. In recent\nyears, there has been a huge push by the\nHigher Education Funding Council for\nEngland (HEFCE) to alter the approach\nto philanthropic giving in England. Between 2008 and July 2011, the matched\nfunding scheme for voluntary giving has\nbeen running. Imperial has taken advantage of this scheme, by which private\ndonations are matched by the HEFCE\non a 3:1 ratio. Under this scheme a \u00a3300\ngift can sum up to a \u00a3500 donation. Imperial has already reached the maximum\nlimit of \u00a32,750,000 being allocated by\nthe HEFCE on the matched funding\nscheme.\nOver \u00a31 million has been raised by the\nprevious telephone campaigns at Imperial to date, from over 5,400 alumni.\nThat\u2019s right, their hard-earned cash is\ngoing to benefit us, the students at Imperial, despite the many years that have\npassed since their graduation.\nSurely this can\u2019t be simply because\nthey had a jolly-good time at Imperial? Many people would agree that\nthey made friends and had fun at their\nfirst bar or part-time job, but as far as\nI am aware, nobody donates to these\norganisations! The truth is that your\ndegree from Imperial could be one of\nyour greatest achievements. It may be\nthe foundation for your chosen career,\nthe friends and contacts you make, your\nfirst move away from home, your sports\nteam, or what you learned about your-self. One alumnus I spoke to got a lot\nmore than just his degree at Imperial; he\nmet his wife!\nAfter reflecting on my conversations\nwith the alumni, the message that I\ncan pass on to our current students is\nto work hard, take up the opportunities\nthat are on offer, and enjoy whatever\nelse it is that makes Imperial special to\nyou.\n\u201cOne alumnus I\nspoke to got a lot\nmore than just his\ndegree at Imperial;\nhe met his wife!\u201d\nfor help at university counselling services in the 2006/2007 academic year did\nso for depression, compared with about\na quarter in the 2003/2004.\u201d Suicide\nand mental health are still subjects that\nmost avoid. Yet the support for services\nsuch as Nightline is increasingly impor-tant, especially as university budgets\nare being cut and counselling services\nare struggling with demand. Current\nNightline co-ordinator, Francesca Alton\nexplains \u201cStudents are more in need of\nsupport than ever due to the increasing stresses on them such as financial\nworries and pressure to fit in and suc-ceed. All these reasons, combined with\nproposed rises in tuition fees and fierce\ncompetition for graduate jobs mean it is\nmore important than ever for us to be\nthere for as many students as possible.\u201d\nWhen asked about how Nightline\nplans to celebrate four decades of student peer support she replied: \u201cto mark\nour anniversary we will be conducting\nthe biggest ever survey of our service\nusers, releasing a commemorative publication and hosting a celebratory event to\nthank all those who have been involved\nwith Nightline and acknowledge their\nhard work, and to celebrate the achievements of the organisation over the past\n40 years.\u201d\nThe creation of Nightline is one of\nImperial\u2019s many remarkable achieve-ments, and what started as a small col-lege-based project has blossomed into\na London-wide charity that has helped,\nand continues to help, thousands of students every year. So, with 40 years of\nthe organisation, let\u2019s just recognise the\nachievements of those Imperial alumni\nthat had the compassion and ingenuity\nback in 1971 to reach out to their fellow\nstudent.\nElizabeth Burks\nThe Imperial-born charity celebrates 40 years of supporting students this year\n\u201cNightline is one\nof Imperial\u2019s\nmany remarkable\nachievements\u201d\nFeatures Editor: Lizzie Crouch\nfelix@imperial.ac.uk\n\n"

    "content": "felix\nCOM M ENT\nL\niving the typical meagre\nstudent existence at Imperial College in South Kensington, one of the wealthiest boroughs in one of the\nworld\u2019s most expensive cities, was never going to be easy. But my soon\u2013to\u2013be\nalma mater (assuming I pass my damned\ndegree) is going to make it a whole lot\nharder with the increase in tuition fees.\nThe powers that be feel that Imperial is\nesteemed enough to demand \u00a39,000 a\nyear for a degree, and had this been the\ncase when I was applying for university,\nI feel my parents would have been far\nless supportive of me coming here. After all, they have had to suffer most of\nthe costs.\nI am fortunate though. This year my\nparents have fallen on hard times and so\nI am a recipient of a Study Support Bursary (SSB). This bursary, with the addition of a maintenance loan and grant\nmean that I am quite comfortably staying afloat without being a burden to my\nparents. In fact, I have more disposable\nincome than they do, and without the\nsupport of the bursary I would have already maxed out my overdraft, spent all\nRhys Davies\nmy savings and be spiraling into debt.\nAdmittedly part of this could be blamed\non my penchant for clothes and cock-tails, but I don\u2019t want to give the impression that the bursary goes towards\nfunding a life of luxury. My indulgences\ncome from savings that any sensible\nperson would conserve for the future. I\nhope my parents don\u2019t read this.\nBut it is the absence of worries of\nmortgages, children and taxes that\nmakes student life so enjoyable. This is\nwhy I think the bursary should continue\nto be given to students cash in hand.\nSure, it would be nice to think that my\nfuture burden of debt could be slashed,\nbut a more immediate necessity is having a roof over my head, affording food\nto eat and doing those recreational activities that make life at Imperial bear-able. In all honesty, I\u2019ve been almost\nunflinching about the rise in tuition fees.\nPart of this is down to a heavy case of\nImperial student apathy, but it\u2019s also because the future repercussions of tuition\nfee and maintenance loan debt feel completely imaginary.\nRelieving accommodation costs\nwould theoretically be the best way of\nensuring that the bursary is spent the\nright way \u2013 akin to giving food vouchers\nto the homeless. But this is impractical\nafter the first year when students move\nout of halls. It\u2019s true that the bursaries\ncan be abused, especially when you are\nsurrounded by predominantly affluent\nstudents and an expensive location. The\nnearest Aldi is miles away and I still find\nSouth Kensington a culture shock, having come from a bland estate in Reading. I am continually bemused that there\nis so little disruption in the borough\nthat council employees spend their time\npainting garden railings. Back home I\u2019m\nmore used to seeing charred bus shelters\nbeing repaired. Maybe I\u2019m embellishing\na little; it has only happened a few times.\nIn essence I\u2019m saying vive le SSB,\nand may it continue to support the living costs of students in need. I know the\nsystem isn\u2019t entirely fair, since I know\nstudents whose parents have a higher\nincome than mine but do not provide as\nmuch as the combination of bursary and\ngovernment contributions do. But then\ndistribution of wealth has never been\nfair, and it\u2019s important that those most in\nneed receive help. Especially me.\nT\nhe other day I saw something strange and wonder-ful. I was walking along\nthe street, happily minding\nmy own business, and happened to stop at a junction. All normal\nso far. Then, a lorry stopped beside me\n\u2013 a FedEx lorry with the FedEx logo emblazoned all over. And that was when I\nsaw it; inside the FedEx logo, there was\nan arrow!\nI am not ashamed to admit that I fell to\nmy knees and wept with awe at the sight.\nThere may be some of you wondering how some trickery of design could\nevoke such a reaction. To these people, I\nsuggest to go away, find the FedEx logo\nand when you see it, I\u2019ll be here with\ntea and biscuits and we can all share our\nexperiences.\nThe odd thing is that I\u2019ve seen the FedEx logo hundreds of times before and\nI\u2019ve never seen that arrow before. Maybe\nit was the lighting, or the angle of the lorry or...whatever! For some reason, it suddenly decided to click. This is indicative\nof something wider, something greater.\nI get the feeling we are simply drifting\naimlessly across the millpond surface of\na much stranger reality.\nFor example, we like to think that the\nOracle of Delphi, who famously messed\nwith people\u2019s minds, was just another\nMelissa Lever\ntale confined to antiquity. We were\nwrong. She just relocated, to Reading of\nall places! My favourite sign along the\nM4 corridor reads \u201cFor the Oracle, turn\noff at Junction 11.\u201d I would go and visit\nher but I\u2019m afraid I might end up doing\nsomething I didn\u2019t mean to, like killing\nmy father or poking a badger in the eye\nor something equally tragic.\nSometimes, we are accustomed to the\nstrangeness only when it\u2019s presented as\nfiction. If I were to describe a magical\nblue box from a faraway land that is bigger on the inside than the out, most of\nyou would instantly jump to TARDIS.\nNot many of you, I reckon, would immediately think of Ikea, but that is exactly what it is! I\u2019m sure at its heart is a\nflat\u2013pack forest, from which they make\nall the furniture \u2013 not that I\u2019ll ever find\nout of course.\nI\u2019ve always been confused that, of\nall the great panoply of creation, most\nthings taste like chicken, especially since\nchicken doesn\u2019t taste like much at all.\nMy bamboozlement was ended by the\napplication of Occam\u2019s Razor, or rather,\nOccam\u2019s carving knife. The reason why\neverything tastes like chicken is because\nall these animals are chickens in dis-guise. For larger animals like crocodiles,\nimagine a pantomime horse but with\nmore players. For a bird that cannot fly\nor run for any meaningful distance, this\nis a wise survival strategy. It\u2019s just unfortunate that people will eat anything. In\na similar vein, human beings taste like\npork (or so I\u2019ve heard) because some\nof us might actually be pigs in disguise.\nThis theory might not be kosher but I\u2019ve\nnever seen a Jewish cannibal.\nThe Pythia in a power suit. Swedish spooning of the Laws of Physics.\nFancy\u2013dress parties for poultry. I won\u2019t\nblame you if you don\u2019t believe these discoveries \u2013 they are incredible, literally.\nBut the more we learn about our world\nand our universe, the more amazing it\nbecomes, to me at least. When explorers first stumbled across the duck-billed\nplatypus, scientists dismissed it as a taxi-dermic joke. Nowadays, we barely raise\nan eyebrow at this egg\u2013laying, poison\u2013\nbarbed, duck\u00acbilled and beaver\u2013tailed\nmonotreme, although they are still kind\nof neat.\nI think with each new discovery, we\nrisk becoming complacent to just how\namazing reality is. When did we become so jaded? Is it cool, or mature, to\nbe unimpressed with everything we see\naround us? If so, call me an immature\nloser! I don\u2019t think there is a worse crime\nthan ignoring how awesome this life is.\nExcept perhaps poking badgers in the\neye.\nDiscovering this weird world\n\u201cI think the bursary\nshould continue to\nbe given to students\ncash in hand\u201d\nA beginners guide to\n\u2018Brit-ing\u2019\nBursaries make university fun\nI don\u2019t know about you, but\nwhenever I venture beyond\nthe borders of this fair nation\ninto the foreign, I\u2019m always\nconvinced that everyone hates\nthe British. Not so! Being unashamedly British is a real asset at times.\nThe first rule of \u2018Brit-ing\u2019\nabroad is this; do not try and\nact like a native. After all you\naren\u2019t one and you\u2019ll end up\ndoing it wrong and potentially\noffending someone. Trying too\nhard to look like you\u2019re not British will be seen as being spineless (we don\u2019t want that, our\nspines are fine thank you very\nmuch) and secondly, you give\nthe impression that you are not\nproud of being British. Then\nyou open yourself up to endless criticism, and sentences\nstarting with \u201cYou know what\u2019s\nwrong with the British?\u201d become tiresome ever so quickly.\nThe second rule of \u2018Briting\u2019 is to dress appropriately.\nI don\u2019t mean wear a top hat\nand tails to breakfast, but I do\nmean that letting your beer belly hang loose from under the\nold and stained fake England\nfootball shirt is entirely unnec-essary. Just like we shouldn\u2019t\nbe ashamed of being British,\nwe shouldn\u2019t feel the need to\ninform the waiter that \u201cI\u2019d like\nchips with that please\u201d by our\nt-shirt. Discretion is key.\nThat\u2019s how not \u2018to Brit\u2019, so\nhow do we \u2018Brit\u2019? Simple. Let\nyour guard down. Inside every\nBrit there is a self-deprecating,\nwitty and cynical narrative. Let\nthe inner Brit roam free. The\nbest way to make friends and\nmore is humour and there\u2019s\nnothing quite like British hu-mour, it will serve you well. Humour and laughing at yourself\nis an essential part of \u2018Brit-ing\u2019.\nIf you really want to \u2018Brit\u2019\nproperly you must play the\npart. Foreigners and in particular Americans like to think\nthat we are a nation of James\nBonds that take tea and say\n\u2018lovely\u2019 all the time. Play up to\nthis and make sure to milk the\naccent for all it\u2019s worth.\nSo remember, don\u2019t be\nashamed, don\u2019t wear England\nfootball shirts, do show your\nhumor and do play up to the\nstereotype!\nHappy Brit-ing.\nBenjamin Plackett\nThe opinions expressed on the Comment pages represent the views of the author only.\n\u201cIs it cool, or mature,\nto be unimpressed\nwith everything we\nsee around us?\u201d\nFriday 18 march 2011 21\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX 15\nSCIENCE\nScientific foundations of T\u014dhoku quake\nL\nike all large earthquakes, the\nJapanese quake occurred in\nwhat is known as a subduction zone. In these zones \u2013 which are\ncommon in the Paci\ufb01c \u2013 large slabs of\nsolid rock called tectonic plates move\ntowards each other. When they collide,\nthe less dense plate will ride over the\ndenser plate, which is forced below the\nother.\nMicheal Warner, Professor of Geophysics at Imperial College, specialises\nin crustal seismology. Warner explained,\n\u201cas the plates push past each other, the\nfriction created locks the plates temporarily together in a boundary zone.\nElastic stresses build up in the rocks in\nthis boundary. Eventually this stress is\nsuf\ufb01cient to overcome friction and essentially breaks the locked boundary\nbetween the plates. This causes a sudden\nrelease of stored elastic energy. Some of\nthe energy that is released propagates\nas seismic waves. It is these waves that\nknock down buildings\u201d.\nThe total amount of energy released\ndepends on the strength of the rocks, the\nsize of the fault (the fractures in these\nrocks) and the total \u2018slip\u2019 that ensues\nwhen the friction becomes too much.\n\u201cStrong rocks, a large fault, and large\nslip gives a big event\u201d, says Warner. \u201cIn\nsubduction zones \u2013 the faults are long,\nthe cold rocks are strong, and there is a\nFriday 18 MARCH 2011\nWarner explains. \u201cJapan has very good\nearthquake resistant building codes.\nMost damage and loss of life was as a\nresult of the tsunami which is very dif\ufb01cult to protect against other than by being elsewhere.\u201d\nThea Cunningham\nEARTHQUAKE PROOFING\nB\nuilding in an earthquake zone\nis, unsurprisingly, a tricky\nbusiness. Japan is no stranger\nto earthquakes, so it has a strict building code in place and some very sturdy\nbuildings. After the Kobe earthquake in\n1995, which killed about 6000 people,\nJapan put enormous resources into designing new buildings that could withstand major earthquakes and also retro\ufb01tting older, more vulnerable ones.\nInstead of trying to make buildings\nearthquake proof, engineers instead\ndesign them to be damaged \u2014 but in a\ncontrolled way that aims to only affect\nspeci\ufb01c parts of the structure.\nPeter Stafford, from the Department\nof Civil and Environmental Engineering at Imperial, explained why:\n\u201cThe act of getting damaged is\nthe way in which structures\nare able to dissipate the energy put into them by earthquakes\u201d. If there was no\ndamage, there would be nowhere for the energy\no f\nthe\nearthquake to\ngo.\nFlexibility is key; taller buildings often have an advantage here as they can sway back\nand forth\nmore easily than\nshorter build-ings, and because\nof this, counterintuitively,\nthey are safer. Short buildings are\nvery rigid and can be shaken violently\nas the ground moves during an earth-quake.\nEarthquakes cause sideways forces\nthat shake buildings. Some buildings\nrest on huge rubber and steel pads that\ncan slide from side to side when an\nearthquake hits and disperse this sideways energy. However, these pads only\nwork for structures up to 20 or 30 storeys high; any taller and the building\nsquashes the pads and makes them use-less.\nSome Japanese high-rise buildings\nalso have a skeleton of steel braces and\nhydraulic shock absorbers. These dampen the earthquake energy as it moves up\nthe building.\nJapan is also well prepared for tsu-namis, with seawalls in many coastal\ntowns that can be as high as 40ft, and\ntsunami shelters on higher ground.\nKelly Oakes\nFIXING FUKUSHIMA\nA\ns well as causing billions of\ndollars worth of damage to the\nbuildings in the T\u014dhoku region\nof Japan, the earthquake has created\none of the most serious building\ncasualties in history \u2013 the Fukushima I Nuclear Power Plant. The\nearthquake, and subsequent tsu-nami, has resulted in a series of incidents that has lead to dangerous levels\nof radiation leaked to the local environment \u2013 an accident that will cost several\nbillion more to \ufb01x.\nThe earthquake, while destabilising the\nbuilding integrity of the reactors, also resulted in the automatic shut down of the\nreactor cores. The subsequent tsunami,\nhowever, delivered the potentially fatal\nblow, by knocking out the generators\nused to power the water pumps used to\ncool the spent fuel storage pools. Normally, pools are kept at around 25\u00b0C, but\nwith the temperature in Unit 4 at 84\u00b0C as\nof the 15th of March, the risk of the water level dropping suf\ufb01ciently to expose\nthe fuel is rising. Were this to happen a\nrisk of radioactive leak could occur.\nDr John Hassard, a reader in Physics\nat Imperial, believes the worst is yet to\ncome. \u201cThe fact they are pumping in sea\nwater to cool the cores is desperation. It\nis not good practice.\u201d Indeed, the situation is getting so desperate, authorities\nhave had to arrange water drops via\nhelicopters onto the overheating fuel\nstores. According to Hassard, the incident is a disaster for nuclear power \u2013 not\njust for Fukushima, but for its reputation as an uncontrollable and dangerous\nforce. \u201cIt\u2019s not that we expect tsunamis\nin Sizewell B, but it shows how complex\nthe systems are and how dif\ufb01cult it is to\nmitigate against failures for complex\nsystems like nuclear plants.\u201d\nDr Hassard points out that while the\nwind direction has helped divert a majority of the contamination toward the\nPaci\ufb01c, it cannot be relied on for too\n\u201cThe tsunami is very\ndifficult to protect\nagainst other than by\nbeing elsewhere\u201d\nHow Japan\u2019s buildings coped in the face of one of the worst quakes in recent history,\nand the struggle to secure the Fukushima nuclear power plant\n\u201cGetting damaged\nis the way in which\nstructures are able\nto dissipate the\nenergy put into them\nby earthquakes\u201d\n\u201cThe fact they are\npumping in sea water\nto cool the cores is\ndesperation\u201d\nlot of accumulated slip\nto release\u201d.\nTsunamis, like the\none that followed last\nFriday\u2019s earthquake,\nare triggered when the sea\nbed moves and \u201cdisplaces\na column of sea water verti-cally. Gravity works to restore\na horizontal sea surface but the\nresulting disturbance propagates as a\nwave. This wave has small amplitude\nin deep water, but the amplitude grows\ndramatically as the wave enters shallow\nwater \u2013 somewhat like a conventional\nwave steepening before it breaks on a\nsloping beach.\u201d\nIt was the tsunami rather than the\nearthquake that drove the majority of\nthe devastation in north-east Japan,\nlong. \u201cThe local people are de\ufb01nitely\nin danger\u201d, he says. \u201cThe radiation will\nbe dominated by Caesium-134 and 137,\nand a number of other radionuclides,\nmost with shorter half lives.\u201d\nWhile the full extent of the damage\nis yet to be known, Hassard notes that\nreactor safety technology has evolved\nsince the 1980s. Had there been a temperature excursion in the RBMK reactors of Chernobyl, we would very likely\nhave seen a situation much much worse.\nCharlie Harvey\nFukushima I before the tsunami. Temperatures in the nuclear storage\ncooling tanks are rising, with it the risk of a major radioactive leak occuring\n\n"

For all\nof them it is likely their second visit in as\nmany weeks and, judging by the slight blurring of their hair-line edge, they\u2019re already a\nfew days overdue.

One not influenced by\nany music band or GQ fashion spread; no one\nat Nike or Rockport ever made a poster with\ntheir products worn like this, and none of these\nguys ever needed them to. It is just what bros\nwear. A precise alchemy of trainers and dark\nsports gear that suggests athleticism, and a\nmanly lack of anything so girly as colour. It is\nbeing ready to do all sorts of hard stuff like go\nto the gym, or fight, or disguise as a shadow\nor whatever.\nIt most definitely is not \u2018gay\u2019.\nWhich is funny, because (whisper it) it is\nonly the clich\u00e9d stereotype of gay men that\ncan rival young Mirpuris in their desire to\nget ripped and look big.

There are no music festivals to go to nor alcohol-soaked house parties.\nThese are all the domain of the British, with just\na bit of clubbing and a few British birds pulled\nas the only (non-\u2018gay\u2019you see) deviations made\nfrom their social regime.\nTheir yardsticks of youth are different; cruising in cars, playing snooker and cotching in\nkebab shops.\nLike the recent addition of Sheesha Cafes,\nthese kebab shops are like Pakistani pubs of the\nurban sprawl, where guys can talk passionately\nabout which takeaway is better than another.\nAfter Pakistani men took over fish-and-chip\nshops and claimed Turkish donner\u2013style meat\nas their own, it was left to the young to train\ntheir palettes on the ingenious mutant dishes\nthat came out of the mash-up. Ask a group of\nPakistani youths about the chicken Tikka baguettes you can get in Digbeth, or Caspian\u2019s\nTandoori pizza, and you can expect a street-talk\node to meat texture and grease doses.\nOr just ask co-author Kahfeel about donner\nmeat and witness his pained expression at being\nP\neople grow roots slowly; it happens unseen, and unknown. Certainly they were hidden from the\nMirpuri men who came here 40\nyears ago, intending to spend some\nyears working and sending money back from\nthe verdant land of Valaid, of England. Afterwards they\u2019d return to build their lives in the\nnew towns of the Mirpur region and New Mirpur City itself. England was just their land of\nopportunity, and it wanted their help.\nOn arriving here they packed into cheap\nrooms and flats, all working throughout the\nday, some donning western suits and dubious\ndance moves at night. Photos were sent back\nfrom studios in Manchester and Bradford, of\nnewly dapper husbands grooming their moustaches and confirming the fantasy of this new\nlife in England to those back home.\nBut this temporary period grew longer and\nlonger, and by the time the men\u2019s wives came\nover to help, it was too late. Their roots had\ngrown too deep. With a few halal butchers,\nmakeshift mosques and community ties, the\nmen had unwittingly started teasing England\u2019s\nsoil into something more habitable. Something\nnew.\nAt least, it looked new. In reality the community had just donned a new garb, a patchwork\nmix of old Mirpuri traits and new British outlets\nfor them. The practical skill of these ex-farmers\nwas channelled into mechanical expertise, an\nin-depth knowledge of cars and a male duty to\n\u2018parallel park\u2019 better than you can sit in a chair.\nMirpuri knowledge of famous poems like\nSaif Ul Malook was replaced by a passion for\nHollywood action fests like Commando and\nPredator. The rapid-fire Potahari tongue was\nremixed with English staples such as Pantry, or\nPehntree, whilst the old remedies of Chickenbroth Yukhni and Kichri were supplemented\nby a Western elixir of life; antibotics. (And\nof course Vicks, the miracle rub able to cure\ncoughs, seal cuts and fix broken limbs).\nBut despite these British flavourings, the Pakistani and Mirpuri communities soon formed\ntheir own urban niches, bustling roads became\ncluttered with packed kebab houses and supermarkets that sold mangoes by the box-load and\nflour by the sack-full. Research by the Office\nfor National Statistics shows that British Pakistanis are more likely to be self-employed than\nany other ethnic group, and all those old jokes\nabout Asians being the corner shop kings now\nring a bit hollow. Corner shops are now just the\nbookends to whole streets of Pakistani, often\nMirpuri businesses.\nThese shop fronts, all Karachi-this and Kashmir-that, are little windows into the modern\nBritish Pakistani community, and its evolution.\nGirls wearing the latest kameez fill fashion\nstores next to Islamic bookshops overflowing\nwith prayer beads and books. Travel agents\npromising cheap flights to the mother land\nFrom the Midlands\nback to Mirpur\nreminded of how much London\u2019s fatty, brown\nstrips of khobez-wrapped meat differs from\nthe dark ribbons of smoother, firmer protein\nfound in the fluffy naan-beads of Derby\u2019s food\nhouses.\nAnd as he will also tell you, it is being so\nembedded into this lifestyle that makes it so\ndifficult when severed from it; cut from the\nfold of community and the familiar rituals of\nthis urban existence. Going away to a university with few spicy-food-fixes and even fewer\npeople able to speak the Pakistani patois of the\nnorth can be alienating. In fact, in some ways\nit\u2019s even more alien than travelling the 6,000\nmiles across the globe back to Mirpur and New\nMirpur City.\nBecause New Mirpur is different, full of\nstrange tourist-traps for a people who once\ncalled it home. There is the \u2018Megamart\u2019 department store for western-style shopping and\n\u2018Mina Kebabs\u2019 for all one\u2019s donner needs.\nWannabe-British politicians campaign there for\nBritish votes, strips of barber shops vie for the\nattention of bros and shops sell British ketchup\nat British prices.\nAnd there is a population of people there who\ncan afford none of it. This stuff is for the Brits,\narriving on packed flights in their Easter and\nSummer holidays, and leaving a debris of unattainable aspirations in their wake.\nIn Mirpur City these Brits stay in 5-bedroom\nGhotian, luxury houses that can cost around\n\u00a3200,000 to buy, an investment for families\nwho leave them empty for the majority of the\nyear. It\u2019s an investment into a false fantasy; that\nsomehow Mirpur is still home, the final desti-nation.\nIt isn\u2019t: Now, here is home. But that final\ndestination is still uncertain. Some Mirpuris\nare making the most of the education system\nand becoming professionals, but many more\ncarry on in static comfort bubbles, protected\nfrom the challenges of meaningful integration\nand contribution to wider society. There is a\nrenaissance in real Islamic understanding, with\nall the connotations of peace and productivity\nthat practising the religion carries. No longer is\nit just the cultural Islamic inheritance of their\nparents. But there is also confusion, and some\nanti-Western sentiment in a community that\nstruggles to articulate its concerns.Atight community that is suspicious of change, one that\nstruggles to accept difference in its ranks as if it\nwere a dangerous mutation.\nAs the well-worn clich\u00e9 goes, the future lies\nwith the youth. It lies in the acceptance and encouragement of difference and progress, without sacrificing the strong values of the past.\nLike Mangla Dam, where in summer the water\nlevel lowers and the buildings of Old Mirpur\nare unveiled, Hindu temples next to Muslim\nMosques, relics of a time of harmony, of a land\nunchanged.\nUnforgotten.\nPART TWO\nO mar H afeez-Bore and\nK ahfeel Hussain on how Mirpuris\nshaped the British Isles and how\nthey themselves were changed\n\u201cA diet of their dads\u2019 80s\naction films and their\ncommunity\u2019s stress on\nphysical capability has\nturned Mirpuris into gym-going Arnie-wannabes.\u201d\nMangla Dam, where in summer the water level lowers\nand the buildings of Old Mirpur are unveiled, Hindu\ntemples next to Muslim mosques, relics of a time of\nharmony, of a land unchanged\n\n"

The IC ladies were\non top form from the start quickly putting pressure on the medics and packing\nout the d with a series of shots on goal.\nUnfortunately the medic keeper kept\ngetting in the way but finally, thanks to a\nlovely chip around the keeper by Teddy,\nIC took the lead.\nSurfers enjoy the\nhospitality of Belushi\u2019s\nwhilst away in Newquay\nAfter half time the medics came out\nstrong and some lovely hockey was\nplayed by both sides. IC midfields and\nforwards kept driving forward into the d\nand it wasn\u2019t long before the ball was in\nthe back of the goal courtesy of a shot by\nTeddy that went just past the keepers left\nleg. The medics responded with several\nbreaks but were unable to convert their\nruns into goals. Their chance came from\na short corner, and they scored bringing\nthe score to 2-1. IC continued to push\nfor another goal, but unfortunately 10\nminutes before the end of play Dobby\nhad to be taken off with a knee injury.\nThankfully Kathryn from the Ladies 2s\nhad remained in kit so stepped in keeping Imperial with 11 players on the\npitch. The match finished 2-1, continuing ICs Varsity hockey success.\nImperial SurfSoc invaded Newquay for\nthe second time this year. Armed with\nboards, wetsuits and Mexican themed\nfancy dress, we hit the road with the intention of having a calm, relaxed weekend away from the stress of city living.\nDidn\u2019t happen, it was mental. After a\nminor detour due to a loo stop (Sarah\nreally needed a poo) and poor navigation (\u201cshould we turn left?\u201d \u2013 \u201cThere\u2019s\nnot another one for miles\u201d \u2013 \u201cSo turn\nleft then?\u201d \u2013 \u201cMy name\u2019s Thom\u201d), we\nfinally made it to Newquay. We headed\nstraight for the bar to make the most\nof our 10% Belushis discount before it\nclosed, so everyone got pretty battered.\nA few pints too many later and it was\ntime for a romantic night-time stroll on\nTowan Beach (there are unconfirmed rumours Harkin may have slipped Harvey\na digit). As everyone knows, the sensible thing to do when it\u2019s pitch black and\nyou\u2019re drunk is to get naked and wonder\ninto the Atlantic Ocean. Surprisingly\n(to us at the time), not so much looking\nLizzy Griffiths\nElliot Taylor\nback on it, the police rocked up. Unfortunately they declined our invitation to\njoin in. Q: How do medics reproduce?\nFrom what I saw that night it can\u2019t be the\nsame way as the rest of us\u2026\nThe next day, after complementary\nbreakfast in Belushis (WIN), it was time\nto get kitted up and into the water. The\nless confident of us opted for lessons,\nwhich proved a wise choice as the waves\nwere huge and the instructor was pretty fit\n(3/10, but I take what I can get/what can\u2019t\nget away). The water was surprisingly\nwarm (and this is coming from someone\nwho usually gets out the water shivering\nwith blue hands) so we were only lured\nout by burgers and hot chocolate. While\nmost of us destroyed a well-earnt lunch,\nHarkin was sadly disappointed due to his\nburger being accompanied by the excrement of a passing seagull (Harvey\u2019s revenge for the unconfirmed \u2018fun\u2019 the previous night). A committed few returned\nto the swell after lunch, while the rest of\nus enjoyed a nap (yes, we\u2019re that hard-core) in preparation for the evening.\nThe evening started with pre-drinks in\nBelushis, then bowling at an alley that\nappeared to be connected to a swingers\nhotel. Then back to the bar for the traditional SurfSoc Ring of Fire (like normal\nring of fire but crueller), and Fines. We\nturned Mexican (F-off Clarkson) with\nlucky-dip moustaches drawn in permanent marker. Error. The night continued\nwith various antics, including the Irish\ncontingency chatting up some 50 year\nold local talent, Hardcore Harvey\u2019s\nusual lairy dance moves, and a failed\n\u2018after-party\u2019 involving unsuccessfully\ndragging Karvelas and Utley from their\nbeds. By \u2018after-party\u2019 I mean rape.\nThe effects of the previous night did\nnot lessen Sunday\u2019s surfing poten-tial, with everyone keen to make the\nmost of the last session before leaving\nNewquay. We spent a chilled morning\nnursing hangovers and ripping barrels;\nthe more experienced conquered the\n10ft swell while the rest of us stuck to\nthe shallows. After hot showers and finally being able to eat something that\nstayed down, we reluctantly loaded the\nminibus and headed back to London. In\nsummary: It was awesome. You missed\nout. Sort your life out and get involved!\nHockey: Medics put\nup good fight, but\nImperial ladies\nremain victorious\nVarsity Women\u2019s Hockey\nImperial 1st 2 - 1 Medicals 1st\nCarina Carter\nRight from the outset the Imperial College team looked to dominate the game\nwith goals coming from the BUCS\nwomen\u2019s Waterpolo finalists. Two goals\nby Sarah Benett within the first 3 minutes and a third from Lisa Goers lead to\na cracking first quarter score: 3-1 to IC.\nThe second quarter saw further excitement as the Medics tried to close the gap\nwhich the girls had made at the start. Ian\nWelch-Phillips opened the scoring for\nthe IC team and then followed it up with\na second, this time from a penalty. However, the medics were clawing at the feet\nof the IC team and had narrowed the gap\nto 5-4 by the half way point.\nWith tension high and still all to play\nfor both teams went into the third quarter with something to prove. Once again\nthe IC team were first to open the scoring\nVarsity Water Polo\nImperial 9 - 8 Medicals\nThomas Trimnell with a great goal from Stefano Longo.\nBut, with two late goals from the Medics,\nthe fourth (and final) quarter started as a\ntie; with neither team willing to budge.\nAn early goal from the Medics put\nthem into the lead for the first time in\nthe game. Excellent play by the IC team,\nhowever, counteracted this travesty only\n15 seconds later with another goal from\nStefano. And IC then went back ahead\nafter a terrific goal from Daryl Khoo.\nThe Medics, not wanting to take another beating, fought back to once again\nequal the scores, leading to the most nail\nbiting final 3 minutes of the game. Even\nwhen IC inevitably went ahead due to\nanother brilliant goal by Ian W-P, the\ngame went on till the very last second;\nthe Medics eventually beaten by the\nclock whilst in a last ditch attempt to\nsalvage their dignity.\nIC reins victorious again, but with the\nMedics drawing ever closer, next year\u2019s\nVarsity match will be one not to miss.\nWater Polo: Close\nfought battle see\nImperial edge ahead\nat the end to beat\nMedicals\nThey seem unfazed by the gringo who has infiltrated their ranks.

Whether it\u2019s vintage tweeds, warm knits, toughened\nleather, pretty lace or sheer silk, this\nseason has us all wrapped up. Textural hybrids were seen at Alexander\nWang with elegant silk trains flowing\nfrom beneath cosy ponchos, whilst\nChanel brought life to its smouldering catwalk by layering feathers and\ntweed on top of sheers. Eveningwear\nhad a romantic twist: at Gucci, fluttering jackets were layered over\nsheer floor length gowns, and despite being shrouded in rumours, a\nswashbuckling Karlie Kloss opened\nat Christian Dior to much appraise.\nHow To Wear It: For those daring\nenough, self-created texture hybrids\nwill guarantee plenty of warmth\ncome winter, but for rookies, tactical layering is key. A smooth elegant\nsheer base is essential, then go wild\nand throw on the chunkiest knits\nyou can find. Whatever you do, make\nsure you pile it on. AY\nFur: the most opulent, controversial\nand outspoken material of fashion\nluxury, is once again the hot-ticket\nfor next season. However, fashionis-tas take note: not just any old piece\nof fluff will do. The bright colours for\nthe summer have filtered through\nonto Autumn catwalks as the standout fluffy pieces came in the boldest hues. Gucci, Dior and Bottega\nVeneta all featured furs in jewel\ntones ranging from golden yellow to\npeacock blue; whilst a pastel palette\nwas favoured at Missoni, with sugary lavenders and spearmint greens.\nGiving a more natural feel, Celine\nand Marni showcased patchwork\npieces in rusty oranges and deep\nforest greens.\nHow To Wear It: Go all-out and make\nsure no one misses you with a bright,\neye-catching fur coat, or rejuvenate\na plain outfit with a statement fur\nskirt.

With any echoes\nof the 1980s long gone with the\nend of 2010, we might attribute it\nto fashion\u2019s new decade of choice:\nthe 1970s. Looser silhouettes were\ndominant throughout but especially\nnotable was the bulging and billowing sleeve, seen at Burberry Prorsum on the coats, and then at Stella McCartney and Jil Sander with\ndropped shoulders tapering into\na wide sleeve. A definite favourite\nwas at Lanvin: Alber Elbaz elegantly\nand effortlessly added the wide\nupper-arm to his gorgeous cocktail\ndresses.\nHow To Wear It: It\u2019s easy to add a\nfashion-forward edge to a classic\npencil skirt a-la Stella McCartney\nwith a rippling sheer blouse.

    "content": "NEWS\nFELIX\nFriday 18 march 2011\n6\nStrike to go ahead but\nnumbers still unknown\nDepartments calm as few declare intention to strike\nStudents improve Tanzanian water\nThe University and College Union (UCU) has\nofficially confirmed that members at Imperial\ncollege will be striking on the 22nd and 24th\nof March. It is still unknown exactly how many\nlecturers will strike but around as of Wednesday\n17th, a dozen had already declared their intentions to College, with more expected to follow.\nAt the time of writing, Physics, and several\nengineering departments, had confirmed that\nfew or no staff had declared their intention to\nstrike. However, staff have some time yet to\nnotify the College of their intentions. The Department of Life Sciences confirmed that taught\npostgraduate courses are likely to be unaffected.\nThe strike is the first at Imperial for almost\na decade. The last time strike action was taken\nwas in 2002, when academics across London\nprotested a freeze to London Weighting, an additional allowance for working in London. Imperial academics have not, in recent history, gone\non strike over local matters, thanks to what the\nCollege describes as a good working relationship between itself and the unions at Imperial.\nThe strike is over proposed changes to the pension scheme, which would see existing academics making increased contributions and newer\nemployees receiving lower final pensions. Sally\nHunt, general secretary of the UCU, said: \u201cUniversity staff [...] have made it clear from the start\nof this dispute that if the employers were not\nprepared to negotiate then we would be left with\nlittle option but to take strike action.\u201d\nLouise Lindsay, Director of Human Resources at Imperial, emphasised that the reforms are\naimed at reducing the cost of pensions, to avoid\ncontributions increasing significantly in the fu-ture. She argued that long-term trends make the\ncurrent system unsustainable. Two years ago,\nwhen employers\u2019 contributions to the scheme\nrose by 2%, Imperial had to pay in an additional \u00a33.1 million per year.\nThe reforms would see existing members of\nthe scheme paying a contribution of 7.5% of\ntheir annual salaries to the scheme. New members would pay the lower 6.5% rate, but receive\na pension based on their career-average salary\nrather than their final salary. In addition, employers and employees will share any increase\nin costs; up until now employee contributions\nhave remained fixed, while employers\u2019 contributions have been more variable.\nOn the days of the strike, staff will not receive\nsalary or be covered by the pension scheme. One\nconsequence of this is that their life insurance\npolicies will not, by default, be covered on these\ndays. This means that in the unlikely event that\na staff member dies on a strike day, their dependants don\u2019t receive the life insurance payments.\nIndeed, some institutions such as Lancaster University are refusing to pay the life cover of their\nstaff on strike days. However, Imperial will be\npaying life cover contributions on strike days,\nas they deem it to be the \u201cright thing to do\u201d and\nhave expressed a willingness to maintain positive relations with their staff.\nIn a message to staff, the College said that\npicket lines were possible but they assured staff\nand students that \u201cthey will not be prevented\nfrom going about their usual business on the day\nof the action if they wish to do so.\u201d\nThe Universities Superannuation Scheme\n(USS), which administers university pensions,\noriginally planned to pass the reforms by the 1st\nofApril. However, the UCU\u2019s refusal to pass the\nreforms means that \u201cit is not possible to forecast\nwhen any changes might be finally decided on.\u201d\nThe deadline was important for tax reasons, but\nnow employees look set to lose out on tax relief\ndue to the delay. In a statement, the USS said:\n\u201cRegrettably the recent events have also affected the ability of the trustee company to implement options to mitigate or eliminate the new\ntax charges that arise for some members as a\nresult of the government\u2019s forthcoming changes\nto the pensions tax relief rules.\u201d\nOverseas Societies\nFind out how you can win funding\nfor your Freshers Event; quick, the\ndeadline is the 13th of May!\nRaincatcher Imperial is an annual student-led\nproject that aims to improve the standards of\nliving in Tanzania through the provision of\nclean drinking water. According to Tanzania\u2019s\nMinistry of Water, 70% of its rural population\nhave no access to safe water, causing the deaths\nof 31,000 children due to diarrhoea each year.\nIn the remote regions, even unclean water is in\nshort supply as the dry season lasts for up to\neight months of the year.\nRaincatcher Imperial was started in 2008\nwhen the Development Officer of the Anglican\nChurch of Tabora wrote to the Engineers Without Borders society at Imperial. In the summer\nof 2009, 10 Imperial students visited Tanzania\nto construct three Rainwater Harvesting Systems (RHSs) in the towns of Kahama, Nzega\nand Igunga. The following year, a new team\ntravelled to the town of Tabora to construct an\nunderground tank for the Mihayo Secondary\nSchool.\nRaincatcher Imperial bears all of the construction costs for all projects, reaching up to\n\u00a315,000 per RHS. This year\u2019s team require a\ncollection of \u00a325,000 to send teams to construct two RHSs.\nThe project recently secured sponsorship\nfrom a competition held by financial services\nfirm UBS, called \u201cFund Your Vision\u201d. Raincatcher Imperial has also organised fundraising\nevents throughout the year to meet the necessary construction costs.\nLast Saturday, the 16 students of the 2011\nteam carried out a sponsored Water Carry, in\nwhich team members each carried 10 litres of\nwater for 10 miles. A band night has been organized for the Union tomorrow night.\nOne site has already been identified for this\nyear\u2019s project while the second site is currently\nunder consideration. The first is St Mary\u2019s Secondary School in Tabora, a boarding school accommodating over 300 girls.\nThe second site has yet to be confirmed but\ntwo potential locations have been identified.\nThe first is a local hospital, where a ferrocement tank would provide clean water for a\nnewly formed surgery unit at the hospital. The\nsecond is a refugee camp, where a ferro-cement\ntank would provide clean water for members of\nthe local community.\nThe RHSs are specially designed to collect\nrainwater from the gutters attached to the roofs\nand have in-built water filters to ensure that the\nwater is drinkable.\nRaincatcher Imperial will train members of\nthe local community for the construction and\nmaintenance of the RHSs, and will be working\nwith the local Tanzanian universities to help\nthem conduct similar projects in the future.\nIf you would like to find out more about\nRaincatcher Imperial or would like to support\ntheir efforts, please visit their website at www.\nrwh-tanzania.co.uk or contact Demetris Hadjigeorgiou at demetris.hadjigeorgiou10@impe-rial.ac.uk.\nTimothy Thang\nHaralambos Dayantis\nCalling all heads of Overseas Societies! This year,\nthe International Office is once again running a competition for overseas societies to win funding for their\nFreshers\u2019 Orientation / Pre-Arrival Event.\nThese events are really useful for freshers to get to\nknow one another and begin to take an active role in\ntheir society. Previous events have included a freshers\u2019 camp, a dinner, an evening out and various other\nevents. International Office funding can be really\nhelpful in getting your event off the ground.\nArta Babaee, who heads up the Iranian Society,\nwon a prize of \u00a3200 last year to put towards his society\u2019s event in an Iranian restaurant. He said: \u201cThe\nfirst event of the year is an important one as this is\nthe event we show the freshers we are there for them\nwhen we need us. Most freshers join the society officially when they buy their tickets for the freshers\u2019\nevent. Our prize helped us to subsidise our event\nso that more freshers could buy tickets and join us\nand also we were able to hold the event in a great\nvenue in High Street Kensington. We were also able\nto lower the ticket price at the same time which was\na great achievement.\u201d\nAshmi Mehta runs the Indian Society and last year\nwon \u00a3200 for a meet and greet event. He said: \u201cWe\nwere able to hire a bigger area because of the prize\nand attracted more students as we could provide a\nvariety of food and drinks. Fresher events are key to\nensure the success of a society during the year. They\nallow new students to meet older year students as\nwell as other people from different halls and cours-es. This year we held our meet and greet, The Indian\nSoc Jam, at the Eastside Bar and we had a huge\nturnout. We had soft drinks, food, as well as music\nwhich made it a relaxing atmosphere for everyone to\ntalk and mingle.\u201d\nHeads of overseas societies should start thinking\nabout their entry proposals now, as the deadline for\nentries is 13th May. Some of the best events are\nlow-cost \u2013 e.g. a meeting in a cafe \u2013 the main thing\nis to give freshers the opportunity to get to know one\nanother!\nIf you are member of an overseas society and you\nwould like to organise an event, contact the International Office at international@imperial.ac.uk for\nfurther guidance on how to submit your competition\nentry.\nLast year the Indian Society won \u00a3200 for their\nmeet and greet event\nNews Editors: Matt Colvin\nAlex Karapetian\nnews.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nStudents building a Rainwater\nHarvesting System\n\n"

    "content": "COMMENT\nfelix\nM\nuammar Gaddafi has\nbeen an outstanding\nfigure on the world\nscene, in terms of absolute lunacy. When it\ncomes to stories about him, it\u2019s hard to\nseparate fact from fiction. Usually, as is\noften the case, the fact is stranger than\nthe fiction. His Facebook page lists his\ninterests as: \u201cLibya\u201d, \u201cPan-Africanism\u201d,\n\u201cHating America\u201d, \u201cJustin Bieber\u201d, and\n\u201ccock.\u201d The last two were the result of an\nunimaginative Facebook rape, I assume.\nColonel Gaddafi is currently in the\nmidst of what is almost a civil war. His\nreaction has been, well, exactly what\nyou would think from a man like him.\nThat is to say, angry, violent, and totally\ninsane. Most noticeably he has given\nsome erratic speeches. Making the effort\nto watch these is really worth it. Most of\nthe time you can even audibly hear the\ntranslator struggling to understand what\non earth he is going on about, and how\nthis could be translated into English. The\nshortest of such appearances occurred\nfrom the back of a car when Gaddafi\ngave a short statement to tell people he\nis still in Tripoli and hasn\u2019t fled.\nHe energetically delivered a speech,\ntransmitted on the 24th of February, in\nfront of his old house. As it is Gaddafi\nwe are talking about, this wasn\u2019t quite\nsymbolic enough. So there was also a\nlarge sculpture of a fist holding a US\nfighter jet and crushing it. Don\u2019t be\nalarmed; the stress of work has not got\nto you. That last sentence said exactly\nwhat you think it just said.\nIt is debatable as to whether the translators took liberties, but either way there\nwere some highlights. Gaddafi said at\none point: \u201cI am a fighter, a revolutionary\nfrom tents.\u201dThat sentence really ran away\nfrom him there. It started out strong, but\nthen, tents? Is he a Boy Scout revolution-ary? My personal highlight in terms of\ninspirational rhetoric was: \u201cLibya wants\nglory; Libya wants to be at the pinnacle,\nat the pinnacle of the world.\u201d Get T-Pain\nto sing that, add in \u201cshawwwty\u201d, slap a\ntriumphant beat in the background, and\nwe have a hit single on our hands.\nBaffling rants are not exactly a new\nphenomenon for Gaddafi; he delivered\na 96 minute speech to the UN in 2009.\nAt this point, you may be wondering\nwho on earth gave the okay for that.\nThe answer is that nobody in the world\nsaid yes. He was given a 15 minute slot,\nbut got a bit carried away. I suppose at\nthe centre of diplomacy it would be a\nbit frowned upon to stand up and shout\n\u201cGet off the stage, you\u2019re shit.\u201d\nThe other regimes to be toppled did so\nat the cost of lives. Sadly, I fear that here\nthere may be an even greater human\ncost. This time, the fighting is fierce and\nGaddafi hasn\u2019t lost the support of the\nmilitary. Once more the international\ncommunity is unhappy about the violence against protesters. Ban ki-Moon\nis, as usual, not too impressed. At the\nend of February, he said that he found\nthe scenes of demonstrators being fired\nupon \u201cdisturbing\u201d and \u201cshocking\u201d. He\nsaid: \u201cThis is unacceptable and must\nstop immediately. Seriously guys, is no\none listening to me? Does it not say\nSecretary motherfucking General anywhere on my suit? That\u2019s it, I\u2019m about\nto impose some sanctions all over your\nass.\u201d Guess which part of that quote the\nmedia decided to report.\nAt this point I will break up the article\nwith a note on the oddity of the rank he\nchose. Gaddafi claimed that he did not\npromote himself to General because he\ndoes not need any grand titles, as his government is one of the people. This rings a\nMad Muammar\nbit hollow when coming from a man who\nhas moreAKAs than a west coast rap star.\nHe goes by: \u201cThe Brother Leader\u201d, \u201cThe\nGuide\u201d, \u201cBrotherly Leader and Guide of\nthe First of September Great Revolution\nof the Socialist People\u2019s Libyan Arab\nJamahiriya\u201d, \u201cBrother Leader and Guide\nof the Revolution\u201d, \u201cChairman of the\nRevolutionary Command Council\u201d and\n(my personal favourite) \u201cKing of Kings\nof Africa\u201d. So, as he said, no grand titles\nthen, really staying grounded. He\u2019s still\nMuammar from the block.\nAnyone else in his position would realise the game is up, and just hand over\npower. The question is: will this be the\nend of Gaddafi\u2019s reign? The BBC certainly doesn\u2019t seem to think he will win\nthis battle, judging by the headline:\n\u201cLibya crisis: no \u2018happy ending\u2019 for\nColonel Gaddafi.\u201d so maybe they were\njust talking about an unsuccessful trip to\na \u201cmassage\u201d parlour. It\u2019s hard to predict\nthe outcome except to say that Gaddafi\nwill not go quietly.\nGaddafi will not go quietly.\nGaddafi has once again demonstrated what a nutcase he is\nWe have the deepest sympathy for Imperial\u2019s senior management. The government\u2019s\nschizophrenic and frankly gormless policy (or\nlack thereof) on higher education must be\ninfuriating for those trying to formulate long-term plans and strategies for this institution.\nThe attitude adopted by recent governments towards universities can best be\ncompared to a bully in a school playground\nholding smaller children by the arm and forcing them to slap themselves. \u201cWhy do you\nkeep hitting yourself?\u201d, is the taunt, as universities find themselves criticised for actions they had no choice but to take.\nRemember the idealistic push to have 50%\nof young people attending university? Fees\nwere introduced to help fund this push. However, as fees increased, government funding\nwas comparatively stagnant, or worse. And\nuniversities who exceeded the government\u2019s\ncap on how many students attended university (yes they do cap it, handing out loans to\ncover the tuition fees that they introduced is\nexpensive business) would be heavily fined.\nThe current government has increased fees\nto \u00a39,000. But at the same time as increasing fees \u2013 ostensibly to give universities\nmore freedom \u2013 they also hoot and howl at\nuniversities who set their fees at the amount\nto which they legislated to increase it.\nThis government has heavily cut funding\nto universities, and raised fees to make up\nfor this loss. But now, the government is\nthreatening to make further cuts to universities who charge the maximum level of fees.\nStranger still, they would prefer universities\nto offer tuition fee waivers to poorer students instead of higher cash bursaries during university; even though everyone except\nNick Clegg can see that cash bursaries are\na more effective way of ensuring that poorer\nstudents are able to attend university.\nFinally, the government has begun to\nsuggest that universities charging \u00a39,000\nshould set quotas for the number of students from disadvantaged backgrounds.\nWhen universities are forced to select students by metrics other than ability \u2013 for the\ncrime of seeking to plug the holes in their\nfunding that the government has brought\nabout \u2013 then it is clear that somebody, somewhere has been grossly incompetent.\nWhich is probably the closest to the truth\nthat we\u2019re going to get. The government, bi-zarrely, didn\u2019t think that universities would\ntry to charge \u00a39,000. They falsely believed\nthat the increase of the cap on fees would\nresult in price competition (a result no previous rise has achieved) and as a result they\nhave massively underestimated the amount\nthey are going to have to extend to students\nto pay their tuition fees. Now universities\u2019\nsenior management have to deal with the\ngovernment\u2019s mad ramblings as they try to\ncontrol this growing financial mess. Once\nagain, they have our deepest sympathies.\nFELIX\nTim Arbabzadah\nHave your say on\nthis article at\nfelixonline.co.uk\nHigher Education Lunacy\nJust let go Gaddafi, you massive raving lunatic...\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nComment Editors: Anna Perman\nJan Piotrowski\n\u201c\n9.\n9.\ng\ng\n\u201c\nng lu\ng lun\n\u201d\n\u201cI am a fighter, a revolutionary\nfrom tents.\u201d What is he \u2013 a boy\nscout revolutionary?\nFriday 18 March 2011\n20\nBen Kennedy\n\n"

For the first 20 minutes, neither\nside was able to break each other\u2019s ranks due to\nsome impressive tackling. After some substandard penalty kicks from both sides, the deadlock was finally broken when Imperial conceded a penalty in front of the posts, Dan Neville\nconverting to give the Medicals a 3-0 lead.\nHowever, the Medicals lead was short lived\nas Imperial\u2019s inside centre, George Lane,\ndived over the line after a quick ball from the\nbreakdown. Kicker James Hayward was unable to convert the try, leaving the score at 5-3.\nImperial kept attacking the Medical line, using their centre partnership of Ben Adubi and\nGeorge Lane to good effect \u2013 despite their best\nefforts the Medicals stood firm. Similarly, the\nMedicals used last years Man of the Match\nJames Sharples, often giving an inside ball\nfrom the wing, but the Medicals found it hard\nto cross the line as Imperial showed some impressive tackling and defence.\nAfter a period of sustained pressure from the\nMedicals, Imperial managed to turn over the\nball, with scrum-half Oli Cox clearing the line,\nonly to find the Medicals\u2019 fullback. The fullback didn\u2019t have a lot of time to think as Man\nof the Match Ben Adubi, like a furious ocelot\nchasing down a lame gnu, crunched the player\nleaving the crowd cheering wildly. The crowds\ncheers grew even further when Medicals second row Andrew Mowatt was sin-binned.\nAfter a somewhat dull first half, the first ten\nminutes of the second half were electrifying,\nwith both teams scoring tries whilst most of the\ncrowd were still at the bar getting their halftime drinks. Imperial were first to score a few\nminutes after the re-start. Sustained pressure\nopened up a gap in the line, and a simple offload\nto prop Simon Fenton saw him cross the line to\ngive Imperial an unprecedented 12-3 lead.\nAlthough things were looking up for the Imperial side, the Medicals were quick to retaliate\nwith Captain Jonathan Fisher-Black scoring\nand Dan Neville converting.\nFor the next 15 minutes, Imperial consistently found themselves defending their try line\nas the Medicals set up camp in the 22. Wave\nafter wave of Medical players battered the Imperial defensive line, but all they were able to\nget from this sustained period of pressure was\nthree points after Imperial gave away a penalty.\nThe Medicals took the lead for the second time\nin the game, edging ahead by a slender 13-12.\nDespite the excellent defence displayed by\nthe Imperial players, this period of pressure\nseemed to demoralise them and they never\nreally looked like getting back into the game.\nFrom the restart, Imperial found themselves\nagain in their own half under pressure, this time\nMedicals Craig Nightingale crossed the line\nto give them a 20-12 lead. A deflated Imperial\nside seem to have given up all together for the\nrest of the game, with winger James Sharples\nscoring again for the Medics, leaving the full\ntime score at 25-12.\nIn a game not too dissimilar to the recent\nArsenal-Barcelona Champions League game,\nImperial, like Arsenal, never really looked like\ncapitalising on their lead, spending most of the\nsecond half defending their line. The Medicals\nyet again showed composure and resilience\nwhen behind, something which Imperial have\nyet to learn and must if they are ever to lay their\nhands on the JPR Williams Cup.\nMan of the Match Ben Adubi\nGraeme Ridler fends of the attention of a Medic defender during Imperial\u2019s ninth consecutive loss at Varsity to the Medics.\nChristopher Walmsley\nChristopher Walmsley\n\n"

All three unions are running their own election for members to\nchoose a new committee to represent\nthem for the upcoming academic year.\nICSMSU nominations closed last Sunday, with the final hustings taking place\ntonight at the Reynolds Bar, Charing\nCross, where candidates will be questioned on their experience and ideas for\nrepresenting Medicine, Biomedical Sciences and Pharmacology students. 16 positions are available, with only 4th Year\nmedic Suzie Rayner running for President (Interview: Page 8). She is the only\ncandidate running for the position. She\nsaid that she is paying close attention to\nthe ideas being put forward by candidates\nfor other positions: \u201cThere\u2019s so much\ncompetition this year for some of the\npositions that it\u2019s been great listening to\nit.\u201d She added that \u201cI\u2019ve been scribbling\ndown ideas either thinking how similar\nthey are to mine, or how good other ideas\nare that I want to borrow.\u201d\nColin Hill, Julian But, and Tsz Kwan\nare all running for President of the\nCGCU, whose elections are also cur-The police are investigating a recent series of bicycle thefts from the bike shed,\nincluding one student who placed a lock\naround the front wheel and thus lost the\nwhole bike, apart from the front wheel.\nThe suspect, caught on CCTV, tends to\nwait for a user to let him in, as a card is\nrequired for access. Then he carries a bicycle in and leaves some time later with\na stolen one, often of high value.\nSurveillance of the bike shed shows\nthe great extent to which students tailgate and allow others to tailgate. The\nadvice for bike shed users is to ensure\nthey lock their bicycles up with high security locks (ideally a \u201cD\u201d lock should\nbe attached to the main frame, not to the\nwheel!) and to avoid being tailgated.\nWhile the spate of thefts of laptops, iPods and phones, even in secure areas,\nis a result of students and staff leaving\nproperty unattended, it is also a product\nof letting unauthorised people into restricted areas.\nCollege Security said that they were\nunable to release CCTV images of the\nsuspect as they have \u201cnot been proved to\nhave committed an offence yet.\u201d\nThe Head of College Security, Terry\nBranch, reminded students to not allow\n\u201ctailgating\u201d into the bike shed and that\nthe College sells gold standard D locks\nat half the usual price to help students\nsecure their bicycles.\nDid the bursary help determine your\nchoice of university?\nI wouldn\u2019t say so. Obviously I was worried about the living costs but it was the\ngovernment grant that was more important in terms of feeling comfortable\nabout coming to London. I knew about\nthe government bursary well before I\napplied to university but I only found\nout Imperial\u2019s bursaries during the application process.\nDo you have a part-time job?\nNo, the bursary means that I don\u2019t have\nto do that, which makes it easier to concentrate on my studies. The reason why\nthe bursary is so helpful is that you don\u2019t\nhave to constantly worry about money\nand have that on your mind constantly.\nWhat do you think of the bursary ser-vice? Is it straightforward?\nYes, it\u2019s very easy and hassle-free. They\nemail you at the beginning of each year\nto remind you about the applications.\nWhat would you like to see as fees rise?\nMore money directed to bursaries or\nreduced fees for poorer students?\nThe problem with bursaries is that students from higher-income families, who\ndon\u2019t receive support from their parents,\nmiss out. I don\u2019t believe in higher fees,\nI\u2019d like to see them stay at the minimum\n\u00a36,000. However, reducing your debt after university doesn\u2019t help with living expenses during university so in that sense,\nmore bursaries are beneficial.\now, say students\nigher fees, as the main barrier to attending university\nattract the diverse range of students it\ncurrently enjoys. Gerry Greyling, Student Finance Support Officer, agreed\nthat Imperial must do more to inform\nprospective students: \u201cAs fees increase\nstudents will be looking at their university choice not only in terms of the\nquality of course but also at what funding the university can offer. So there\u2019s\na real incentive to collate all the information about scholarships and funding in one place.\u201d He recognised that\nDepartmental Scholarships are very\ndecentralised, highlighting the lack of\na central place where students can find\nTuition fee waivers or cash bursaries?\nrently in full swing. Efforts will be focused on increasing the turnout after\ndisappointing figures in previous years.\nAccording to current President, Victor du\nMesnil du Buisson, this is partly due to\nproblems in management that the union\nhas faced. He believes that \u201cthe CGCU\nneeds some kind of rebranding to become more approachable to students\u201d\nand hopes that next year\u2019s committee \u201cis\nfirmly prepared and are motivated to start\nthe next year and bring back CGCU.\u201d\nThe RCSU will also be looking to increase participation amongst its mem-bers, with nominations having closed\non Thursday. Current president, Scott\nHeath, hopes that the turnout for these\nelections will mirror the record-break-ing figures from the ICU elections earlier this week. However, he admitted\nthat it\u2019s not going to be an easy task with\nabout 40% of the voting population in\nthe RCSU being postgraduates. He says\nhe finds it \u201cvery difficult to get them enthused about the election\u201d. When considering only the undergraduate turnout,\nthe figure stands at roughly 24%, and\nthis year\u2019s plans to get more students\nto participate in the elections include\nlunchtime hustings with free food, in the\nhope of increasing the turnout.\nHustings:\nMedics \u2013 Friday 18th, 7pm, Reynolds.\nRCSU \u2013 Monday 21st, 12:15pm, Student Activity Space, 2nd floor Union\nDeepka Rana\nAlex Nowbar\neduction in their fees\ninformation about all of them. Student\nFinance Support is currently working\non the creation of a portal on the central bursaries website, where they can\ncollate all of the available sources of\nfunding and advertise them to students.\nWhat is clear from the results of the\nsurvey is that Imperial is already doing\nan exemplary job at providing financial aid to its students, a fact made all\nthe more impressive considering how\nmany people SFS employs. Moreover,\nImperial already meets the requirements set out by the Office for Fair\nAccess (OFFA) in response to government changes in tuition fees. The future\nof bursaries remains unclear \u2013 there is\ngovernment pressure to offer \u2018freebies\u2019\nin the form of fee waivers; but students\nstill require substantial help with rising\nliving costs. Kendall pointed out that\nthe survey goes some way to settling\nthe argument over the future of tuition\nfee waivers and bursaries. The future\nis likely to see a balance being struck\nbetween implementing fee waivers and\nreducing the amount of \u2018cash in hand\u2019\nstudents receive, in order to ensure students can still afford to apply to and\nstudy at Imperial.\nChemistry\nstudent taken\nto hospital after\nsuffering burns\nA second year Chemistry student was\ntaken to hospital on Tuesday 15th after\nsuffering burns. It is believed that diethyl ether vapour ignited causing the\nparts of the student\u2019s body to catch fire.\nAnother student present put him out\nwith a labcoat. The student was taken\nto Chelsea & Westminster hospital via\nambulance.\nThe rise in tuition fees has sparked\na contentious debate about how to\nensure the participation of those\nfrom poorer backgrounds in higher\neducation. In this rather topsy-tur-vy argument, it is the government\n\u2013 who raised the fees in the first\nplace \u2013 that are arguing for lower\nfees, while universities are more\ninclined to charge the top rate and\noffer greater cash bursaries to\nstudents.\nA cynic might say that the government is motivated by a need\nto reduce its own costs, rather\nthan concern for students. It\ncosts the government money to\nprovide tuition fee loans for stu-dents. It estimated that universities would charge an average\n\u00a37,500 in fees. As it becomes\nmore likely that many will charge\nthe full rate, the government has\nsuddenly found that it has massively under budgeted.\nBecause the government\ndoesn\u2019t have the legal power to\nforce universities to charge specific fees \u2013 aside from legislating\na maximum \u2013 it is now looking at\nother ways to recoup its costs.\nThe universities minister David\nWilletts has threatened universities that charge the \u00a39,000 rate\nwith further cuts in funding.\nThe shadow universities minister Gareth Thomas perhaps hit\nthe nail on the head when he said\nthat this government has ended\nup charging students \u201cmore and\nmore\u201d while saving the government \u201cless and less\u201d.\n\n"

So,\nperhaps it\u2019s time for us to\nembrace the ecology of\nour urban areas, look at the species that\nthrive in these environments and take\nsteps to protect them. At the same time,\nwe must ensure that our urban environments do not unnecessarily encroach\nupon remaining green spaces and our\ncities do not grow in an unsustainable\nmanner.\nHere at Imperial College, we are right\nin the centre of one of the world\u2019s great\ncities, capital of one of the world\u2019s most\nindustrialised nations. So, how much\ndo we know about our urban environ-ment? And, what kinds of efforts are being made to improve the ecology of our\ncampus?\nOf course, London is famous for its\ngreat parks and Hyde Park is just a couple of minutes walk away from campus.\nHowever, whilst London\u2019s parks are undoubtedly great places to spend a sunny\nSunday afternoon, they aren\u2019t always\nnecessarily home to the most diverse\nrange of plant and animal life. This is\nwhere TrUE comes in. TrUE stands for\nthe Trust for Urban Ecology, which was\nset up by environmentalist Max Nicholson in 1976. TrUE now runs four sites\nhere in London: Greenwich Peninsula\nEcology Park, Lavender Pond Nature\nPark, Dulwich Upper Wood and Stave\nHill Ecological Park. These sites provide important habitats for many spe-cies, but they\u2019re also about education,\nwith lots of school activity programmes\nand opportunities for local people, like\nus, to get involved. Mick Wheeley, site\nadministrator at Greenwich Peninsula,\nsaid: \u201cSome of the kids who come down\nhere really have no idea about British\nwildlife \u2013 they come down here expecting to see crocodiles! But they learn lots\nat our site and they\u2019re still excited by\nlooking at the newts, frogs and birds we\ndo have here\u201d.\nEven closer to home, here at Imperial College, there\u2019s also a community\nof volunteers keen on protecting our\nnatural environment. Environment Soc\nis led by Reuben Gibbon, a medical student with a passion for all things green.\nReuben and his band of just 16 urban\necowarriors work on a small garden\nplot, hidden away behind Ethos. The\ngarden is officially called \u2018Prince\u2019s Gate\nGarden\u2019, but it\u2019s affectionately known\nas \u2018the secret garden\u2019 amongst society\nmembers. The garden has a pond with\na thriving frog population and there are\na number of small allotments where a\nrange of fruit and vegetables are grown\n\u2013 they even have a banana plant. However, Reuben is keen to stress that the\nsociety isn\u2019t just about gardening: \u201cWe\nalso get involved in lots of environmental campaigning. Last year, we were particularly involved in the 10:10 campaign\nto tackle climate change\u201d.\nAlong with Stef Piatek, Reuben is also\nEnvironment Officer for Imperial College Union. The pair recently pressed\nthe Union to remove Blue Shark from\nthe menu of FiveSixEight. Stef argued\nthat, \u201cselling shark meat just doesn\u2019t\nmake sense, blue fin sharks aren\u2019t quite...\n[an] endangered species yet, but they\u2019re\npretty close, so I don\u2019t really think they\nought to be selling this sort of meat\u201d.\nOf course, it\u2019s not just students who\nare looking after Imperial\u2019s green spaces\nand making sure we reduce our negative\nenvironmental impacts. Last month saw\nthe first batch of compost from Imperial\u2019s new ComPod programme used\nby gardeners on the South Kensington\nCampus. ComPod is a food composting\nplant, designed using technology developed here at Imperial, which composts\nthe 1.1 tonnes of food waste produced at\nthe College each week. Imperial College\nhas been given two Rushlight awards for\nthis programme. Whilst this is certainly\ngood news, Imperial College\u2019s main\ncontribution to the world of sustainable\nurban ecology is undoubtedly through\nits leading academic research.\nDr Simon Leather is a reader in applied ecology at Imperial\u2019s Silwood\nImperial\u2019s CO2 Savings\nAn important part of ecology is looking at ecosystems\u2019 net carbon dioxide exchange levels. Urban\necosystems are net producers of CO2, but steps\ncan be taken to reduce the amount of CO2 they add\nto the atmosphere. Below are just a few of the measures being taken here at Imperial\u2019s South Kensington campus to help meet the university\u2019s target of\nreducing CO2 emissions 20% by 2014.\nTraditional tube heat exchangers have been replaced\nwith energy-efficient plate heat exchangers, saving\n20 tonnes of CO2 every year.\n1. Traditional tube heat\nexchangers\nImperial\u2019s heating system consists of over 3km of\npipes. Insulating these pipes has the potential to\nsave a whopping 1,500 tonnes of CO2 per year.\nWork to do this has already started and, for every\n3m of pipes insulated, enough energy is saved to\nheat an average house.\n2. Insulating heating pipes\nImperial now has its own combined heat and power\nplant, which is far more efficient than traditional\npower plants, where large amounts of energy are\nlost through heat to the atmosphere.\n3. Imperial power\nOver 150 individual cooling units spread across the\ncampus have been replaced with a more-efficient\ncentral cooling system.\n4. Central cooling system\nDid you know that Imperial has its own private electrical network, which allows it to control the voltage\nfrom sub-stations? By reducing the voltage by just\n5%, roughly 500 tonnes of CO2 can be saved every\nyear.\n5.

On every\nstreet corner you will find a carved cathedral and a \u2018helado\u2019 shop, selling you\nice-cream in any flavour from tiramisu,\nto lemon meringue pie, flan and \u2018Bariloche\u2019 chocolate.\nTaking a bicycle a couple of miles\nout of the centre, you discover over\n1300 wineries around the Mendozian\narea, each growing the \u2018Malbec\u2019 grape\nas their speciality. Rows upon rows of\ngreen vineyards, covered netting, oak\nbetween the two countries, making our\ncrossing an altogether less enjoyable\nexperience.

Here I thought I would fill\nyou in on some of the more gripping\ntales we have heard from travellers in\nSouth America.\nAlthough Argentinean and Brazilian\nculture means they are warm, open, generous people, this openness also means\nthat crime, whether petty or more sinis-ter, is rife. On our journey the first warning came from a chef who had gone to\nan all night fiesta in Rio de Janeiro, ended up drinking beyond his companion\u00b4s\nleaving time and woke in the morning\nbeside a Brazilian girl in a favela. Discovering at the doctors that his drink had\nbeen spiked with Rohipnol, he was just\nstarting his course of anti-retrovirals for\nHIV prophylaxis as we left.\nThe second came from the stories of\nthe \u2018favela tours\u2019 in the centre of Rio,\nwhere tourists can experience the murky\nunderbelly of Brazil\u2019s poorer districts led\nby ex-gang members, with profits going\nback to regenerate the slums. Despite the\nsafety of fellow non-local companions,\ntaking photographs is strictly at your own\nrisk. One Israeli backpacker got a little\ntoo snap-happy and ended up fighting\nover his digital camera with a seven year\nold drug dealer who thought the guy was\ngoing to sell his photograph to the police.\nMore sinister was the account on a\nlong-haul bus where masked gunmen\nstopped travellers on a night bus between\nRio de Janeiro and San Paulo with shot-guns, by peppering the windscreen with\nbullets. Boarding the bus they forced the\ndriver to take it miles into the deserted\nsugar cane fields whereby all males onboard were led out and stripped naked\nbefore being locked in the luggage hold.\n\u201cSouth America is a\ncrazy continent\u201d\nNo, no, no. First you waft the aroma! Philistines...\nIf you look carefully in the distance, you can just about make out the last of Charlie Sheen\u2019s dignity...\n\u201cOne backpacker\nended up fighting\nover his digital\ncamera with a seven\nyear old drug dealer\u201d\nbarrels and quaint French-style build-ings, painted white with a terracotta roof\ntiling. Outside Argentinean farmers toil\nat the seed of the land. At our wine tasting we were surprised that the most aromatic and beautiful wine was white, as\nin England it was agreed that we would\nnormally associate it with the taste of\nacrid petrol. Suddenly we could smell\napricots, honey, and elderflower. It was\neasy to romanticise life at an organic\nwinery, crushing grapes by hand, using\nthe skins and seed, throwing the stems\nfor compost, labelling your own bottles,\nexporting hand-picked goods.\nLeaving Mendoza after just two\ndays, we took a tourist bus through the\nspectacular Andes up across the border\nof Chile and in to Santiago. The driver\ndribbled the bus around the windy\nmountain path like an NBA basketball\nplayer, swirling past great sweeping\nsnow covered landscapes. However, a\nbout of food poisoning meant that I was\ncapable of vomiting both on the Argentinean and Chilean sides of the border\nand once in metaphorical no-man\u2019s land\nThe gunmen then re-embarked to strip-search the female passengers and thrust\nthe barrels of their guns in their faces\nuntil thousands of pesos and personal\nbelongings were taken. Following the\nincident the frightened and upset group\nwere finally taken to the local police station with the hope of nothing more than\na report and a claims receipt.\nLuckily we have felt safe until now,\nalthough not as safe as one Italian backpacker we met, who has been hitchhiking lifts from Argentinean truck drivers\nup and down the country based on his\nreasonably decent patter of Spanish.\nDespite the phrasebook\u2019s best inten-tions, the stream of dialect that follows\na question is almost impossible to keep\ntrack of and their English is almost always better than our Spanish. Recalling\nan American girl who spouted off \u201cno\nNINTENDO\u201d rather than \u201cno entiendo\u201d\n(I do not understand) a lack of Spanish is a frustrating obstacle to throwing\nyourself fully into the local culture, although potentially allows you to avoid\nmore dangerous areas by adhering very\nclosely to the well-walked gringo trail.\nSouth America, from what we have\nseen so far, is a crazy continent, one that\nhas provided spectacular views, breathtaking experiences and extreme warning\nscares. As Sinatra said, \u201cthat\u2019s life\u201d.\nIt\u2019s too late to start worrying about leaving the oven on now...\n\n"

Imperial played to their full\npotential and ran out 5-4 winners.\nImperial started in the best possible\nmanner, winning an early short corner.\nSam injected and Jaideep Desai set himself up for a huge hit that resembled a\ngolf swing more than a hockey shot.\nThis hit popped up in the air, and JD reacted first to the loose ball, playing in\ncaptain Ewan Quince for him to put Imperial 1-0 up.\nImperial continued their dominance\nand good midfield work from veteran\nNick Jones led to Ewan setting up Koch\nfor a golden chance, which sadly went\nstraight at the keeper. The Medics soon\nwon a short corner, which would have\ngone in, but for Matty J\u2019s interception.\nSadly, from the resulting short corner,\nthe Medics converted to enter the half\ntime at 1-1.\nAt this stage, it was anyone;s game,\nand an inspirational team talk from\nEwan was necessary. Imperial took this\nto heart and early in the second half,\nJones, the Finesmaster for the team,\nbroke with outrageous pace to set up a\nchance that Koch put just wide.\nImperial kept knocking at the door.\nAnother piece of beautiful play from\nJones saw a cross go agonisingly past\nJD\u2019s stick. All this good work was undone in one swift move as a Medic\ncounter attack saw them win another\nshort. Despite the best efforts of Lars, a\ngreat routine saw the Medics bury a shot\ninto the bottom corner, just past Vish\u2019s\ndive.\nImperial\u2019s response was almost in-stant. Great work from Gilles on the\nright saw Imperial win a short corner.\nTom Koch\u2019s excellent drag flick pulled\nImperial level. The Medics response\nwas swift and deadly, with College\ncaught napping, The Medics were ahead\nagain. A great response from Imperial\nalmost followed, with Ewan rattling the\ncrossbar. This was followed up by Ewan\nhitting the side of the goal from a Nick\nPrior through ball.

The message was\nclear, be certain and composed, clearly\nno one told Sam who got himself a yellow and a ten minute sin-bin. Despite\nthe Medics advantage, Imperial managed to go 5-3 up. Ewan with his back\nto the goal swiveled and roofed his shot\ninto the top right. It was no less than IC\ndeserved.\nThe Medics were not done and a drive\ndown the right hand side saw the Medics\nscore from the top of the D.

    "content": "FELIX Friday 18 March 2011 29\nA R T S\nP\nhotography has always been a bit\nof a mystery to me. I understand\nthe fascination with trying to capture a moment in time. I also see\nthat cameras can capture more than\njust scenes. However, as a painter, the camera\nseems to me to be a very blunt, restrictive tool.\nThat said, the geek in me is pretty interested in\nthose sleek, expensive looking cameras and the\nlazy artist in me is definitely interested in works\nof art you can produce at the push of a button.\nArmed with this array of prejudices I pottered along to PhotoSoc\u2019s exhibition Reflections Through the Aperture. My initial\nreaction was quite positive. The exhibition\nis imaginatively hung, and this dynamic approach to curating really brings the exhibition\nto life. There was also a lot more colour than\nI was expecting, and was I impressed by the\nsubtle progression from realism to abstraction.\nSo how had the contributors chosen to interpret \u2018reflections\u2019? Unsurprisingly there were\nquite a few pictures of reflective surfaces. However, I was far more drawn to the abstract and\ninterpretive works. There was certainly a wide\nvariety of these.Afew deserve special mention.\n\u2018Vanishing\u2019 by David Zheng, hung at the end\nof the gallery, shows a double expose of a long\ncorridor superimposed under cables emerging\nradialy from a pylon. The impression, of bleak,\ndrawn-out perspective is quite powerful.\nMy favourite set by far, wistfully titled \u2018You\nuse a glass mirror to see your face; you use\nworks of art to see your soul\u2019, by Ewa Lachowicz, consists of three portraits. The female\nsubject is poised amidst a whirl of her own\nmovement and ethereal lights. The sense of\nwarmth and intimacy is palpable. Ewa says of\nher work that \u201c[it] explore[s] purely aesthetic\nforms as well as deeply personal reflection\u201d.\nThis sentiment is much more in tune with the\naims of the contemporary and traditional artists I am more used to reviewing\nMy reaction to the exhibition was not entirely\npositive.Agroup of prints showing out of focus\nmacros of shiny things, while pretty, seem to\nlack depth. Similarly the trend for photomon-tages involving contemporary and historical\nphotographs of urban scenes appeared to be\nmore of an exercise in Photoshop than a serious attempt to explore the theme. This idea\nhas been knocking around the internet for long\nenough to gain the dreaded mantle of clich\u00e9.\nMy feeling is that this particular c-word is\nharder to avoid in photography. You may have\nexpected this review to follow the classic \u201cauthor\u2019s preconceptions are shattered\u201d structure.\nNot quite. I am, however, glad to see that there\nis imaginative artwork at Imperial that starts\nlife as silver nitrate and not in a tube of paint.\nReflections Through\nthe Aperture, reviewed\nby LeoSoc\u2019s Meredith\nThomas\nWreckage, reviewed\nby PhotoSoc\u2019s Sam\nWhitcomb\nPhotosoc and Leosoc go head to head\nWhat do they really think? The two societies review each other\u2019s recent exhibitions.\nI\n\u2019m not really sure how to consider\nLeonardo Fine Art Society\u2019s latest\nshow; Wreckage. You see, I\u2019m used to\nseeing a scattering of photos on those\npasty walls, or even a flock of birds\nswooping through the gallery \u2013 not a torn mass\nof paint regurgitating out of the walls, nor a\ncolossal Hepworth-esque tangle of strings extending up out of and down into oblivion. The\neffect was powerful.\nThat\u2019s what\u2019s so tricky about a society wide\nexhibition: The struggle to connect pieces\nwhich have been submitted exclusively,\nsome by a group, and some as individuals. I\nfound, however, that Wreckage bypassed this\ndifficulty with ease, sidestepping the preconceptions that all pieces were required to hold\na connection. Of course, narratives could\nbe formed if pushed hard enough but on the\nwhole each piece was so startlingly different\nfrom the last it became necessary to allow\nyourself to observe each piece in isolated\nconsideration.\nAttending the gallery opening granted me an\nadditional insight, that of the artist. Perched\ndelicately on a secluded podium lay what I assumed to be an old wrecked book with someone\u2019s green scrawl crossing, commenting and\ncannibalising the words.\nOn approaching the artist, Maria Han Veiga,\nshe explained, \u201cthe book displays language\nas it should be, as it was. I\u2019ve corrected the\ntext so it\u2019s more in tune with the way we communicate today, depicting how language has\nevolved to accommodate our steadily adapting vocabulary.\u201d And although it was hinted\nthat the further we evolve our language, the\nmore we dilute, pollute and ultimately wreck\nit, she draws an interesting paradox between\nwhat to some is considered creation and others\ndestruction.\nAnother novel idea presented itself in the\nform of a computer game written by Hugh\nOsborne, depicting the familiar and frustrating cleanup operation following a house party.\nBottles deposited in unlikely places, beer cans\nabandoned in an inebriated search for more.\nYour task simple: To insert the rubbish into\nbins, a task which was ironically fuelled by\nthe free flowing wine provided! But it was\nthis which fascinated me: the stark differences\nbetween the individual pieces and their blinkered nature, crafted by completely independent thinking.\nPossibly the most disturbing, yet brilliant\npiece was entitled, \u2018Imminent Wreckage\u2019.\nHidden in a row of cabinets in the shadow\nof the main gallery lay a series of balloons\nhung an instant from destruction. Spikes surrounded and flames abounded; each balloon\nwas doomed to die in its own sickening way\nyet it was death by the knife, a few tantalising\nmillimetres from the surface of the stretched\nrubber, which concerned me. It is a feeling I\nhave felt a million times over, one which I feel\nsure every member of Imperial has felt one too\nmany times. The realisation that you\u2019re teetering on the edge. That deadline is about to pass,\nthat exam is about to be failed, or that you\u2019ve\ndrunk too much and you\u2019re about to explode.\nFor me it was an unsympathetic analysis of\nthat realisation of doom, and its loneliness\nwas stark.\nIt\u2019s exhibitions like these which allude to the\nfact that Imperial College is multitalented, that\nperhaps some of its students\u2019 genius is in the\nsubtle use of intellect to evoke feeling. That\nbeing said, it is perhaps the demanding intellect of our students which keeps them at home\nstudying, for the gallery opening was not well\nattended despite a reasonably far-reaching\nposter campaign.\nStill, the exhibition has been well received\nby those who attended, and it is exhibitions\nlike Wreckage and Untethered which have ensured the continued eminence of student art in\nthe Blyth Gallery.\nWreckage has closed. Now Showing in the Blyth Gallery\nThis is Wreckage. Not going to argue with that.\nA piece from Wreckage \u2013 looks like a pretty damn good pizza. I need more of those easter eggs...\nMery (left) from LeoSoc, wrote (right) about Sam (right) who wrote (left) about Maria (centre). Confused?\n\n"

    "content": "GAMES\nFELIX 39\naccess to \u2018The Magician\u2019s Guide Book\u2019\n\u2013 by choosing certain tricks from this\ntome you can progress through situations that might have otherwise been im-possible. After selecting the right trick\nyou must combine a series of \u2018moves\u2019,\nif you will, to pull off the trick success-fully; for example, a slight of hand or\nslipping items up your sleeve. Every\ntrick is explained in the book, but you\nhave to choose the right items in order\nto complete the trick. This is a really fun\nway to solve some puzzles, as you can\ntrick characters along the way in order to\nprogress, giving a new side to the \u2018pointand-click\u2019 gameplay. Obviously there\nare some puzzles that are simply riddles,\njigsaws or scavenger hunts, but these are\nto be expected in this style of game.\nAll in all, Gray Matter is enjoyable\nbut can sometimes disappoint. It\u2019s come\nout at a time when this style of gameplay\nhas really passed. Although it brings a\nfew new ideas to the table, it is really\njust a standard \u2018point-and-click\u2019 game\nand feels a bit out of date. One thing that\nI will reiterate is the amount of detail\nthat this game goes into with its background information. If you spend a lot\nof time going through every last piece,\nyou\u2019ll really get a lot out of Gray Matter. However, if that isn\u2019t what you\u2019re\nlooking for, it can really feel like it\u2019s\ndragging on. With eight years of produc-tion, I really feel this game should have\ndone so much more.\nGray Matter is available now from\nWizarBox and Lace Mamba Global for\nPC and Xbox 360.\nG\nray Matter starts off\nas any mystery game\nwould: a creepy old man-sion, half an hour\u2019s bus\nride from Oxford, during the middle of a storm. Sam Everett\nis an American who practices magic and\nis searching for a secret magicians\u2019 club\nknown as the Daedalus Club. Her motorbike breaks down in the rain and she\nhappens to stop near the mansion. To\nblag a room for the night, she pretends\nto be the new assistant to the owner, Dr.\nDavid Styles, an expert in the field of\n\u2018unusual neurological abnormalities\u2019.\nIn the morning, Sam realises that she\ncan make a bit of money by continuing\nher deception, and so starts performing\ntasks for Dr Styles. She must gather up\nseveral guinea pigs for his next experi-ment, so she goes to Oxford to find students (pretentious or otherwise) to take\npart. Of course, the good Doctor has a\nshady past, about which more is discovered throughout the storyline.\nThere is definitely a lot of intrigue in\nGray Matter. The storyline is gripping\nand really makes the player want to keep\nplaying in order to find out everything\nabout the game world. Jane Jensen, the\ngame\u2019s designer, has clearly done a lot of\nresearch. By exploring the game, players\ncan find out so much and not all of it is\nnecessary for the game. You can access\nlibraries and file cabinets, giving you\naccess to a vast plethora of information\nabout either Oxford, magic or neuroscience \u2013 the scale really is impressive.\nMusic in the game works very well,\nadding much to the atmosphere and accentuating the feeling of mystery in a\nlot of the settings. Occasionally sound\neffects were far too loud, just to make\nit obvious something was there. For example in the tutorial, the sound of the\nrabbit chewing was unnaturally loud. It\noverpowered the music and any other\nsounds, and just felt unnecessary.\nGraphics, however, vary hugely in\nGray Matter. During gameplay there\u2019s a\nvast amount of effort put into even the\nsmallest of details, and it really looks\nspectacular. The backgrounds are well\nthought-out, and the whole game has a\nreally realistic look. However, during\ncut scenes the visuals really fall apart.\nThe characters judder and any realism is\ngone \u2013 yet this is how the game opens,\nrather disappointingly. For a game that\nhas been in production for eight years,\nI feel the cut scenes could really have\nbeen improved upon.\nGray Matter works like most other\n\u2018point-and-click\u2019 adventures. Players\nYou\u2019ll need a lot of Gray\nMatter to enjoy this one\nFriday 18 march 2011\nfind points of interest around the room,\nclicking on them to get information and\nto go to different places. The more you\nclick on, the more information you get.\nSometimes you must use items in your\ninventory to progress and certain rooms\nremain inaccessible until you have completed certain tasks. Like the majority of\nthese games, it can sometimes become a\nbit boring. This is even worse if you get\nstuck, as you often find yourself going\nto the same rooms and looking for the\nsmallest detail that could help you.\nyou get is the word \u2018Error\u2019 projected at\nyou, and no ramifications. I mean, come\non, everyone has that little bit of sadist\nin them that wants to just be able to have\ntheir scalpel accidentally slip. The only\nway you can fail an operation is if you\nchoose the wrong instrument use it on\nthe patient too many times, or if their vitals get to dangerous levels.\nThis isn\u2019t the only thing to jar you out\nof the simulated world. You are required\nto shave hairless areas, right over the\nwound that you are to be operating on.\nSurgery Simulator literally consists of\neight different operations. One of which\nis called \u2018Road Traffic Accident\u2019\u2026 this\nis the sort of level we\u2019re operating on\n(pun intended). Oh, and I should warn\nyou: \u201cThis product is a computer game\nand not for training or tuition purposes!!!\u201d So you Medics that have picked\nup this title to enhance your surgical\nskills, think again.\nI can\u2019t get over the brevity of this\ngame. Eight operations \u2013 that\u2019s it. You\ncan perform each operation in either a\nCampaign mode, which requires you to\ncomplete each operation in turn before\nprogressing to the next, or Free Play\nmode, which lets you play any operation straight from the off. Additionally,\nthere are three difficulty levels for the\nwhole game and you can choose to\nhave the game tell you everything to\ndo, or nothing at all. That is the entire\nscope of this Surgery Simulator \u2013 it\u2019s\nthe sort of level of depth I\u2019d expect\nfrom a Flash game.\nHowever, the operations themselves\ndo have some merit. Although I have\nno surgical experience, the operations\nconsist of a seemingly logical series of\nsteps, and it\u2019s not difficult to imagine\nthe real-life operations being reflected in\nthese simulations. This, with the added\n\u201crealism\u201d of monitoring and correcting\nlevels of anaesthesia, at least creates a\nfeel of a semi-real operating theatre.\nBut you can\u2019t kill anyone! No matter\nhow many times you try and cut at the\ninnards of your unfortunate patient, all\n\u201cIt\u2019s the sort of level\nof depth I\u2019d expect\nfrom a Flash game\u201d\n\u201cThere is no hint\nsystem, whch I feel\nis actually a good\nthing\u201d\nGreat story but nothing new, says Sean Harbison\nThere is no hint system, which, despite the difficulty, I feel is actually a\ngood thing for this style of game. Often\nthese systems cheapen the game and\nmake it far too easy, but this choice may\nput off playes that are finding it hard to\nprogress. There is, however, a chance to\nshow every item in the room with which\nyou can interact. This allows you to see\nwhat you can interact with but doesn\u2019t\nshow how important certain things are,\nor tell you if items might need to be used\non them, therefore keeping the difficulty\nat the same sort of level.\nGray Matter also brings a new idea to\nthe table. As Sam is a magician you have\nMaybe if you got back to reading the article you\u2019d know the graphics rock!\nNot exactly cutting\nedge gaming\nWhip out your scalpel and\nforceps in Surgery Simulator\nHmm, for this operation I think I\u2019ll choose... the CREEPY FALSE HAND tool\nChris Bowers\nNot only is the step apparently unnec-essary, I imagine it would be dangerous\nand counter-productive. But hey, what\ndo I know? Then you have to disinfect\nthe area, which has no visible effect on\nthe skin, making it very difficult to com-plete. For a simulator, these non-realistic\neffects really spoil the illusion.\nIn short, Surgery Simulator does one\nthing well \u2013 and that\u2019s the procedures\nthemselves \u2013 but apart from that, it\nsucks. It has nowhere enough content to\nwarrant its price tag and what there is\nfeels too restricted and isn\u2019t at all grip-ping. One to avoid, in my opinion.\nAvailable now from Rondomedia and\nExcalibur Publishing for PC.\n\n"

    "content": "GAMES\nFELIX\nGames Editor: Simon Worthington\ngames.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nY\nou can generally assign video\ngames into one of three catego-ries. The first group houses the\ngames that you just can\u2019t stop\nplaying. If you\u2019re in a game and\nyour friends start to ask you if you ought to\neat and suggest that you might want to take a\nshower sometime, then it more than likely falls\ninto this group.\nThe second category contains mostly single\nplayer games, ones you can play a few times\nwithout getting too bored. Fun, but replay value\nis limited. Finally there are tier three games,\ngames which are just plain bad. The only reason you play these abominations is to justify\nthe cash you splurged out on them.\nBaron Wittard: Nemesis of Ragnarok, henceforth shortened to NoR, falls somewhere between categories two and three. It\u2019s not so bad\nthat I ever considered tooth-pulling more en-joyable, but it\u2019s not so amazing that I\u2019ll be playing it a second time.\nNoR was created by a two person development team called Wax Lyrical Games, and\nserves as their first title. It follows the tale of\na photographer sent into an old abandoned city\ncalled \u2018The Utopia\u2019, built by the title\u2019s aforementioned Baron Wittard. Naturally, any idiot\nwho calls their creation \u2018The Utopia\u2019 is just\nscreaming out for fate to smack them around\nthe chops and turn their Utopia into a Dystopia. Of course, everything went tits up and by\nthe time your character arrives two years later\neverything\u2019s just a little bit old and mouldy.\nNow, to review this game I\u2019m going to start\nwith my rough line of thought when I started\nplaying. First things first, there are no video\nsettings. The resolution and graphical quality\nare fixed, and I spent the whole game playing\nwith black borders that letterboxed the screen.\nWhilst I understand that top-tier graphics aren\u2019t\nalways available to smaller developers, I would\nhave appreciated the ability to at least alter the\ngame\u2019s resolution.\nThe movement controls. Oh yes, the movement controls. NoR is a point and click puzzle\ngame, so naturally control is somewhat limited\nversus say an FPS, but I\u2019ve seen point and click\ndone better than this. The last game of this type I\nplayed was Sam & Max: The Devil\u2019s Playhouse\nand that managed it really well, giving you full\ncontrol over a small interactive area. In NoR\nyou can\u2019t freely move your character about,\nand you\u2019re limited to moving to set positions in\nthe environment. This became particularly irritating when I was rolling the mouse about the\nscreen to find the area to move to next.\nOK, now we\u2019re into gameplay. Gameplay\nmakes or breaks a game, as redundant as that\nmay sound. The controls can be stodgy, the\ngraphics average, but if a game has a succinct plot and challenging elements that drive\nit along these smaller gripes can be ignored.\nOnly, NoR doesn\u2019t quite deliver, and the aforementioned gripes are only amplified.\nTo put it simply, NoR is, in essence, a string\nof various logic puzzles strung together with a\nfairly average story and clich\u00e9 horror elements\nthat are about as scary as a kitten arching its\nback and mewling dangerously. The game\u2019s\nbox doesn\u2019t seem to promote it as a horror\nbeyond \u2018Spine-Tingling Mystery Adventure\nGame\u2019, but the flickering lights and use of\ndarkness imply it\u2019s trying to be one. Without\nthe horror or a properly convincing story it\u2019s\njust a big puzzle game.\nNow, there\u2019s nothing wrong with puzzle\ngames, but the way the player has to solve puzzles is poor at best. There\u2019s a lot of going back\nand forth \u2013 first you need to locate ten hidden\nrune stones, find their meaning in one book,\nthen find out which room you have to take them\nto from another book in another room, which\ncontains a puzzle whose solution is found in\nanother wretched room. You see where this\nyou feel like a proper detective. If that\u2019s you,\ngreat, go buy NoR now. To me, it simply felt\nclunky. The guy has a camera in his inventory\nfor Pete\u2019s sake; I was honestly expecting the\nability to take pictures for reference which\ncould be scrolled through at another point in\nthe game. I can\u2019t see why Wax Lyrical Games\ndidn\u2019t \u2013 it\u2019d provide a method for keeping everything neatly on hand without the game giving you any clues or requiring a pen and paper,\nAND it wouldn\u2019t feel out of place in the slight-est. But no. You use your camera once. ONCE,\nfor a completely arbitrary puzzle. A wasted op-portunity, guys.\nLook, for all my hate, Barron Wittard: Nemesis of Ragnarok isn\u2019t by any means a train\nwreck that should be avoided like the bubonic\nplague. NoR has the potential to be a really\ngreat game. It has sturdy foundations but pa-per-thin walls. There were no bug issues that\ncropped up, the puzzles were hard enough to\nkeep my large Imperial brain ticking over and\nthe music was nicely fitting. The story could\nhave benefited with a little extra work, and\nas I said above a system for capturing images\nwould have alleviated a lot of fiddly note taking when it came to problem solving.\nWould I recommend this game? It depends\non if you believe indie developers deserve\nyour money to create a new and better title by\ncorrecting their mistakes.

Anyway Ocean is a bit of\nan anomaly amongst OF: rather than rapping about\nrape, he tends to croon about how good a lover he\nis. Def Jam originally picked Ocean up for a record\ndeal but then dropped him when they succumbed\nto their recent financial woes. What a mistake that\nwas. If you\u2019re trying to make money as a label you\nprobably shouldn\u2019t let go of one of the most promis-ing, soulful and inspired R&B singers around. All you\nneed to get the Ocean bug is to come into contact\nwith amazing tunes like \u2018Novacane\u2019, \u2018Swim Good\u2019 or\n\u2018Songs for Women\u2019. This album is pretty much the audio equivalent of crack: once you try it, you just can\u2019t\nlet go man. Seriously, how many R&B singers have\nyou heard sampling Kubrick movies, or rhyming about\npoon over MGMT? Genius. Greg Power\nMost listened to\nthis week by\nFelix Music\nmembers on\nlast.fm\nMake sure not to miss\nThe Hamptons\n12 Bar Club, Denmark Street\nWednesday, 30th March 2011\nThis gig may not be until next week, but this source\nof biblical knowledge won\u2019t be around then, so lis-ten. This London-based six-piece are taking to 12\nBar Club for a night of rocking the tennis socks off\ntheir pounding feet, and possibly the tops off their\nfemale fans. Featuring vocal/guitarist cousinly love\nfrom across the pond and a comradeship through\ntheir music, the benefits of the American/English\ninfluence are clear here, keeping the rock alive in\nthe heart of both sounds. Known for keeping venues\non their feet through their flying guitars and clearly\ncolossal sound, these boys are sure to provide your\nWednesday night with that wall you\u2019ll probably end\nup running into anyway and some high energy an-tics. Having featured on BBC radio and US stations\nin Gainesville and Tampa, this is one not to miss...\nTrust me. Luke Turner\nH\nave you ever felt like going to\na pub, having a couple of pints,\nplaying some old style video\ngames and hanging out with\nfriends? Yes? Well, you\u2019re not\nalone. Two guys, Nicholas Thurgood (Nicky)\nand David Lightfoot (Dave), have just started\nrunning a monthly event called Nintendisco.\nThe basic idea is to get people together and\nhang out in a bar, and then play videogames to-gether, whilst listening to music, from contemporary radio hits to video game theme tunes!\nNicky and Dave have both been gaming fans\nsince they were kids. Dave\u2019s first console was a\n48k Spectrum that he shared together with his\nbrother, and this is what started his lifelong pas-sion. From this starting point, both guys spent\ntime in signed, touring bands before joining the\ntwo interests together and starting Nintendisco.\nThey explain that they \u201cwanted to combine our\nlive musical/promoting experience with our\nlove for games and make an event that everyone could enjoy. Sort of like gaming karaoke,\nor watching a football match on a big screen,\nbut watching a round of Mario Kart instead.\u201dAs\na start-up, they spent some time going through\ndifferent games, looking for retro, fun and accessible games that could work well on a big\nscreen.\nThe first event was at the Lock Tavern in Camden. Nicky and Dave were at first worried about\nhow many people would show up, being unsure\nof people\u2019s interest. It turned out to be the least\nof their worries, and they moved to a larger ven-ue: 93 Feet East on Brick Lane.

It\u2019s still a\nfairly small pub, with some leather sofas spread\naround, a DJ podium in one of the corners and\nthe screen on the wall facing the entrance. The\natmosphere is laid back, two players at a time\nsitting down on one of the sofas and by the podium the hosts take turns in presenting the players\nand commentating on the game. To get to play\nyou hand in a piece of paper with your name\nand which game you would prefer to play, e.g.\nSuper Mario Kart or Street Fighter. They recommend you hand in the paper fairly early to make\nsure you get to play, a challenge that has turned\nout to be much bigger than getting people to the\nvenue. To make sure that there isn\u2019t one person\ndominating all night long, there is a small prize\nceremony after a certain number of victories;\nhow many depending on the game being played.\nDuring the ceremonies, the Star Wars Imperial\nMarch soundtrack plays in the background and\nthe winner is placed on a podium where he receive a small gold medal and a t-shirt.\nIf this is something that interests you, the\nnext event will take place 28th April. Although, already next week, on the 24th March,\nNintendisco will be a part of the launch event\nfor Nintendo 3DS. Instead of focusing on their\nregular old school games only, they will hold\na 3D Tournament, but still play the mixture\nof Nintendo sounds and contemporary music.\nThis launch event is at HMV Oxford Street\n(Oxford St, London W1A 1AB), so why not\ncelebrate end of term but getting together a\nbunch of friends and challenge each other on\nvideo games? To follow coming events and\nupdates on what games will be on, have a look\nat the Facebook group (\u201cNintendisco\u201d) or follow them on Twitter (@Nintendisco).\nIn Tension, as the crowd welcome the music\ndrone and power from both vocals and synth.\nFunchess\u2019 vocals bring memories of a female Ian Curtis with attitude as she yelps and\nshouts with a shocking vocal range through\nthe microphone, using smartly placed loops\nto weld into Coviello\u2019s rhythms. The sound\nmatches New Order\u2019s electronic reign post-Curtis, with his female successor. The hugely\ndramatic event keeps the crowd enticed and\non the verge of anarchy. Using recognisable\nthemes and forceful bass and lyrics, the two\nkeep the intensity at bursting level as they career through their appropriately named album.\n\u2018Knights and Week Ends\u2019 along with \u2018Skull\nFuct\u2019 send patches of the crowd into apoplexy\nand patches into jaw-dropping shock.\nThe fearless New Yorkers just started the\nfight and wont be going down in the first\nround. This is only the start for Funchess and\nCoviello. The dark dungeons of Corsica studios being an ideal place for this round, Light\nAsylum have started making waves.\nLuke Turner\nwww.soundcloud.com/the-hamptons\nThe Brooklyn twosome start a right raucous night in South London\nCharlotte Levin\n\n"

    "content": "F\nI\nL\nM\nFELIX 33\nFriday 18 march 2011\nFor Country fans only\nDirector Shana Feste\nScreenwriter Shana Feste\nCast Gwenyth Paltrow, Tim McGraw,\nGarrett Hedlund, Leighton Meester,\nMarshall Chapman\nCountry Song\nJohn Park\nAs her performance on Glee showed\nus all, it appears that Gwyneth Paltrow can both act AND sing. She was\njust a substitute teacher on the hit U.S.\nTV show but with Country Strong, the\nfilm is all about her, starring as famous\ncountry singer Kelly Canter from Texas,\ntrying to make a comeback in the music industry, whilst being threatened by\na younger, hotter and talented teen. To\nadd to more drama, she is an alcoholic\nwith a tumultuous love life \u2013 throw in\nsome rehab, and this completes the most\nclich\u00e9d set-up for a musical drama.\nIt was recently announced that Paltrow\nis very close to signing a record deal \u2013\nand it\u2019s not difficult to see why. With her\nclean-cut voice, she carries the country\nsongs well. She may not have the most\npowerful set of lungs, but vocally she\nseems more than capable of handling a\nsolo stage. It\u2019s a shame, then, that Paltrow is far too underused musically. Her\ncharacter is mostly involved in sense-less, meandering, alcohol-fuelled drama\nthat she doesn\u2019t get a lot of screen-time\nto show off her singing abilities.\nKelly Canter has been in rehab after a\ndisastrous, drunken performance in Dallas attracted much criticism. Even worse\nshe was 5-months pregnant at the time,\nwhich subsequently led her to lose the\nbaby altogether. She is released a month\nahead of schedule, and obviously has\nbeen let go far too early, but her ambitious husband James (Tim McGraw) insists that she makes her comeback now\nand turns it into a memorable one. The\npressure is on for Kelly, with her over-bearing, affection-free husband being\nof absolutely no help, and the stiff competition from an up and coming young\nrising star Chiles Stanton (Leighton\nMeester). Though she finds solace in\nher concerned rehab worker, Beau Hutton (Garrett Hedlund) who is genuinely\nlooking out for Kelly\u2019s well-being, Beau\nalso just happens to be a talented country singer and is asked to join them on\ntour.\nPredictably, Kelly continues to go on\nmore drinking benders, but the alcoholism aspect of the film seems to come\nand go at the film\u2019s convenience. In\none scene Kelly is waving around a litre of vodka, drinking it straight out of\nthe bottle, and in another scene, alcohol\nhas disappeared completely, with no\nfurther mention or development on her\nproblems. Nothing is told of how this\ndependence started, and though Paltrow\ndisplays depression and repressed emotions well, the script does not offer any\ndecent depth for Paltrow to portray on\nscreen.\nWhatever emptiness there is on screen\ncannot be blamed on the actors. Despite\nall the rash decisions and melodramatic\nchoices they make, there is not even the\nslightest hint behind the characters\u2019 in-tentions, which is why it\u2019s even harder\nto find some meaning to justify the\nfilm\u2019s rushed, irrational and \u201ctear-jerker\u201d ending.\nManipulative is too weak a word to\ndescribe the extent the film is willing to\ngo to just for another heavy, emotional\nscene. Much like its protagonist, the film\nneeds to take intermittent breaks from\nall the intense, though quite frankly, sil-ly, drama. There\u2019s a fight, then a concert,\nanother argument, another concert in a\ndifferent city, and this cycle goes on and\non. If you\u2019re not a fan of country music,\nyou can forget about watching this; half\nof the film is filled with mellow, acoustic guitar-backed songs full of corny lyr-ics. Aside from this \u2013 which may still\nappeal to some \u2013 the story itself leaves\nno noticeable impact.\nHollywood gets flattened in Battle: L.A.\nDirector Jonathon Liebesman\nScreenwriter Christopher Bertolini\nCast Aaron Eckhart, Michelle\nRodriguez, Ramon Rodriguez,\nBridget Moynahan, Ne-Yo\nBattle: Los Angeles\nEd Knock\nThe recent resurrection of the sci-fi\ngenre has changed how many people\nview this typically maligned section\nof cinema but Battle: Los Angeles fails\nto match the quality of the critically\nclaimed films Moon and District 9. District 9 was intriguing by being set in\nthe little filmed Johannesburg whereas\nLos Angeles is familiar city of endless identical suburban houses and as a\nhorde of aliens quickly reduce the place\nto a heap of smouldering rubble, I can\u2019t\nhelp but think that no-one would really\ncare if this characterless metropolis was\nvaporised.\nThe film is essentially a re-hash of\nBlack Hawk Down, though replacing the\nfaceless Somali insurgents with faceless\nminiaturised versions of Optimus Prime,\nand it suffers from the same problems\nas Ridley Scott\u2019s muddled war epic \u2013\nnamely characterisation. We\u2019re introduced to a gang of multi-ethnic fresh\nfaced marines at the start and they\u2019re\nsubject to the usual clich\u00e9s; either\nthey\u2019re over confident bad-asses or insecure newbies. Attached to the platoon is\na world-weary veteran played by Aaron\nEckhart who has a reputation for getting\nhis soldiers killed. It\u2019s not long before\nmysterious asteroids start bombarding\nthe coasts of New York, Tokyo, London\nand errr Galway and news soon filters\nthrough of an extra-terrestrial invasion\nbefore our plucky soldiers are whisked\noff to extract civialians from L.A. as\nemotionless mechanical E.T.s emerge\nfrom the ocean to begin their murderous\nassault on the local surfers.\nDirector Jonathon Liebesman provides some flimsy answers for the aliens\nmotives; they\u2019re here for our water and\nto successfully colonise our planet they\nmust exterminate the native population.\nBut any references to post-colonial guilt\nare quickly swept aside and replaced\nwith American paranoia of invading\nforeign forces. In fairness, he does create a generally creepy atmosphere as the\nmarines locate an over-run police station\namongst charred bodies and an unseen\nenemy with tense jump in your seat\nmoments. However the aliens reveal\nthemselves all too soon and the film descends into a standard \u2018shoot em up\u2019 and\nunsurprisingly the marines are perfect\nshots, whereas the aliens, with all their\nsophisticated firepower and technology,\nmiraculously can\u2019t hit a thing.\nThere\u2019s a brief interlude in an abandoned airbase where attempts at deep\ndialogue between characters betray the\ncringe worthy failures of the script and\nonce the action resumes, the chaotic\nscenes of warfare quickly become tedi-ous. Michelle Rodriguez joins the cast\nto play a vulnerable, sensitive victim.\nSorry, I\u2019m pulling your leg, she fills her\nstereotyped boots as the usual tough girl\nalongside Aaron Eckhart who was so\nbrilliant in Thank You for Smoking and\nThe Dark Knight, but here he just grunts\nout his lines with a permanent textbook\nexpression of exasperation. Battle: Los\nAngeles has a promising start but a weak\nscript, uninspiring plot and poor characters quickly turn it into traditional brain\ndead action fare. Wait, wait! Aaah man, it isn\u2019t Batman.\n\n"

She made some\namazing saves and appeared to be completely on the ball despite her illness.\nThe only thing she failed to realise\nwas they had actually won the first two\nmatches, rather than lost them, like she\nthought!\nThe team consists of girls from all dis-ciplines, from Chemists to Medics, and\nthey all came together as an incredible\nteam to achieve their well-deserved suc-cess.\nSince the girls won their group, South\nEast England, they now will move up\nto the 1st division to compete against\nteams like Oxford and Cambridge in the\nchampionship. In the first round the girls\nhad an incredible goal difference of over\n60 points. Throughout the season they\nhave not lost a single match and are beginning to appear invincible. Let\u2019s hope\nthat this continues right through to the\nfinal and on to next year.\nThe girls could have not performed as\nwell as they did if it hadn\u2019t been for their\nfantastic coach, Adam Walzer. Who encouraged and supported the girls even\nthrough the hardest and most stressful\nmatches.\nAt the end of this year unfortunately\nboth Vera Gielen and Sarah Benett will\nbe leaving, after 5 and 3 years respec-tively, of being part of the water polo\nteam. They will be greatly missed and\nnext year the team hopes to continue the\ngreat successes that they have brought\nto the club. Congratulations also go to\nthe IC mixed water polo team who won\nthe ULU league after a nail-biting final\ngame against UCL.\nNine in a row\nfor Medicals\nMedics dominate second half to win\nJPR Williams Cup.

    "content": "SCIENCE\nFELIX\n14\nScience Editors: Kelly Oakes,\nCharlie Harvey, Thea Cunningham\nscience.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nIn brief\nAn a\u2013peel\u2013ing water filter\nIf you thought banana peels were only useful for\npractical jokes, think again. According to new re-search, the slippery skins can also prove a dab hand\nat removing toxic heavy metals from contaminated\nriver water to make it safe to drink. Waterways are\ncommonly contaminated with heavy metals such as\ncopper and lead that result from mining processes,\nindustrial wastes and runoff from farms. This contaminated wastewater poses a threat to humans,\nthe aquatic environment and the fish, plants and\nsediments that inhabit it.\nTo filter out these harmful elements, scientists use\na number of extractors including silica, cellulose, and\naluminum oxide, which contain acids that bind to the\nmetal ions. However, these technologies have proved\ncostly and the extractors themselves can be toxic.\nUsing natural materials to extract heavy metals from\nriver water is a more appealing purification method\nbecause it is both cheaper, and more environmentally\nfriendly. Natural materials also don\u2019t need any chemical modification like other extractors do. So far, scientists have used natural materials we often consider\nwaste, like sugar cane and peanut shells. In Brazil,\nGustavo Castro of the Botucatu Institute of Biosciences, and his colleagues, proposed that banana peels\nmight be capable of purifying drinking water too. To\ninvestigate, the researchers ground banana peels to\nidentify the atoms that allow it to coordinate metal\nions. They then used the peels to make filters through\nwhich they fed the contaminated water.\nThe team found the fruit peels were better at extracting lead and copper from riverwater than the\nfilter technology they compared it with. They concluded banana skins can be used to identify metal\ncontaminants in raw river water. What\u2019s more, the\nresults suggest these fruity filters can be re-used\n11 times without losing their filtration ability. The\nstudy was published in the American Chemical Society\u2019s journal Industrial & Engineering Chemistry\nResearch.\nThea Cunningham\nSamuel Furse\nMRI machines make a peculiar sort of layered\nwhirring noise, both when one is in them and\none is waiting to be in one. At other times too,\nI should think, but I did not stick around for\nthose.\nFirst, I was waiting there. The cheery woman\ntook my forms, checked over the sundry de-tails, sat me in the room with the lockers in it\nand explained about what to do with the key\nand so on. I suppose I needed to wait until the\nprevious patient\u2019s scans were complete. It was\na slightly nervous wait in a small room, with\nlarge, off-white cabinets on either side of me,\nthe large surface of the doors broken up only\nby plastic badges reading SIEMENS in that\nrevolting green they use. My foot\u2019s smarting a\nbit. I have walked for over an hour today, I cal-culate, more than I have done for a while even\nif it was mainly in trainers. After I do not know\nhow long, my phone being both off and in the\nlocker, I get called in.\nAt the beginning of last December I was\nunwise enough to wear hard shoes on hard\nground. This is normally fine, though in the\npast I have had achy feet from doing this for\ntoo long. This time is not \u2018fine\u2019. My left foot,\none of the metatarsals in fact, is very slightly\nachy after wearing those shoes on the Monday.\nI choose to ignore it, I am unfit and the left leg\nis the weaker anyway. After Tuesday it is really\nquite painful so I stop wearing those shoes and\nrevert to my rubber-soled hush puppies. The\nachiness gets no better and over the next few\nweeks, the damned thing starts to swell up as\nwell. I put this down to a bit of a trauma \u2013 this\nwas the diagnosis last time anyway, and I can\nrest it soon as it is sit-on-your-arse-it-is-Christ-mas time. I am still limping but whatever.\nFunnily enough, I was seeing a medic\naround this time. Needless to say she asked\nme why I had not been to see my GP. I said it\nwas all rather trivial and would get better. The\nfact was, I could not walk far without being in\nsome pain. Still, I rested it over Christmas, after I got back from my parents\u2019. All seemed to\nbe better. I wore trainers for as long as I could,\nand looked forward to my second placement\nwhich would have to be in softer shoes. This\nall seemed better though once the swelling of\nthe soft tissue had disappeared I was left with\na hard lump on my foot. This clearly was not\ngoing away, and neither was the on-and-off\naching. At this point I did book an appoint-ment. I had to wait three weeks as there was\nnothing outside the hours of 9am and 4pm before then. Sigh.\nI chatted to my GP, who was great; she referred me for an x-ray. Being nosey, I wanted\nto look at the images, so I did, albeit only on a\nsmall screen. A large calcified lump was evi-dent, two in fact, one on each of the two larger\nmetatarsals. Evidence of at least one stress\nfracture \u2013 oh bugger. Turns out the disapproving medic had been right after all. I cheerily\nwent on my way, texting her with what little\nmobile phone battery I had left at the time, to\nsay she had been right.\nWhat I was not expecting was a second re-ferral. My GP rang me personally to say that\nthe consultant radiologist had recommended\nthat I go for an MRI scan urgently as a close\ninspection of my x-rays had indicated that the\nbone growth was abnormal. She knows about\nmy research background and so she needed\nto say no more than that to get her meaning\nacross. I did not know what to think. I still do\nnot, now.\nI went for the scan. It seemed to go along al-right. I left in rather a daze. Outside was colder\nthan inside, unsurprisingly, though switching\nmy phone back on I got a message saying I had\nnot been given a job I had put in for earlier.\nNo feeling. I had asked to see the images after\nthe scan, but after a momentary stiff pause the\nunidentifiably-accented radiographer declined\nwith a tone that suggested it was more trouble\nthan it was worth to organise. I had no desire to\nbe rude so accepted this without playing \u2018the\ndoctor card\u2019, and left.\nThe next piece in this particular story has\nyet to come I am afraid. Hopefully I will know\nwhether or not I have cancer by the time you\nread this, though. Watch this space.\nToday, I\u2019m going to talk about Ian M. Banks\u2019\nfirst science fiction novel, Consider Phlebas.\nThe story is set in the midst of a war between\ntwo societies: the human \u2018Culture\u2019and the alien\n\u2018Idirans\u2019. Banks draws the reader in from the\nvery start with the fast paced first chapter describing how a sentient Culture computer crash\nlands on a desolate planet, Schar\u2019s World, after\nmanaging to escape an Idiran attack. This is\none of the best introductions I\u2019ve ever seen in a\nbook, introducing readers to a rich and detailed\nuniverse and leaving them hungry for more.\nThe story follows Culture agent Perosteck\nBalveda and Bora Horza Gobuchul, a human working for the Idirans, as they struggle\nto find a computer, whose advanced design\ncould greatly help whichever side found it. The\nbook\u2019s middle section is probably its weakest\npart. Separated from the Idiran fleet, Horza is\nforced to join up with a group of pirates to get\nto his goal and has to help out with a number of\ntheir illegal raids. While each of the set pieces\nin this part of the book are certainly diverting,\noverall, they are somewhat forgettable and\nseem to lack focus. The group\u2019s incompetence\nquickly gets annoying and apart from the admittedly brilliant character development this\nsection adds very little to the overarching story.\nThe novel really picks up again when Balveda and Horza finally make it to Schar\u2019s World.\nThe conclusion was very surprising, not because of how unbelievable it was but rather the\nopposite. I hadn\u2019t expected a book like this to\nhave such a bleak and yet truly great finale: a\ngripping and poignant examination of the horrors of war and how very little individual people can matter in the grand scheme of things.\nThis is where all the character development really pays off, the ending being far more powerful for us having grown to care for Horza in the\nprevious chapters.\nWhile certainly not for those who like happy\nendings, and though much of its middle is needless filler which could easily have been removed,\nthis is a must read book. It forms the perfect introduction to Bank\u2019s brilliant series of Culture\nnovels and I guarantee that the final chapters\nwill move you like few other novels could.\nA medical adventure: the beginning\nSCIENCE FICTION\nC O N S I D E R\nPHLEBAS\nMaciej Matuszewski\ndiscovers the rich and\ndetailed universe of\nIan M.

The project, entitled\n\u201cMusical Expression\u201d aims to develop an entirely new musical instrument which is, above all, intuitive to\nuse, and which facilitates the creative process by collapsing the barrier between idea and creation.\nMusic is one of the most widespread yet\nleast understood aspects of human cul-ture. Indeed, some say the human capacity to appreciate music is what makes us\nhuman. It seems strange then, to think\nthat although we can all enjoy music, be\nit by ourselves or with other people, not\nall of us can make it.\nWhy is this so? In our opinion, it is to\ndo with the structure and technique of\nmusical instruments. They are the tools\nwith which music is made, yet they are\ncomplex and refined to be operated in\na very specific way, requiring a great\namount of skill from the player. Yet this\nseems to go against the notion of the\ninstinctive nature of music. Effectively,\nthe relationship between the tool and the\ncraft is skewed so that we are left to devise a set of methods and techniques that\nCreativity & Intuition\n\u00cd\u00f1igo Mart\u00ednez de Rituerto de Troya on his second year EEE\ngroup project entitled \u201cMusical Expression\u201d\nBlanca Mart\u00ednez de Rituerto de Troya (www.escapecomplex.com)\nwe must learn before achieving anything.\nThis is not only an issue for the layman but also for the seasoned musician\nwho tries to explore the infinite possibilities of music. Often they are faced with\ntechnical or practical limitations which\nstand in the way of realising their artistic\nintentions and what\u2019s worse, often these\nlimitations or the path to overcome them\nwill corrupt the idealised concept. While\nthis may always yield interesting results,\nas is observable in the more adventurous\nstyles of music, it becomes little more\nthan a frustration for those seeking to\nbring their ideas squarely into being.\nMost people have a natural disposition towards music developed through\nevolution and social adaptation. Music\nis enjoyed as a means of celebration,\nentertainment, an intellectual exercise\nor as a vehicle for human interaction.\nHowever, this deep seated affinity for\nsound remains largely passive for the\ngreater proportion of the human popu-lation. This is largely due to the division between music listening and music\nmaking or the separation between audience and performer. The greatest barrier\nbetween enjoying and producing music\nlies in the sound sources themselves, the\ninstruments.\nMusical instruments require a great\ndeal of skill and education before one\ncan play them properly or at a satisfactory level. The reason why this is so is because of the way the instruments work,\nrequiring a great deal of memorisation\nand familiarity before producing any appreciable composition of sounds. This is\na problem of design which doesn\u2019t op-timise the interaction between the user\nand the tool. When else do we encounter\na line of strings or a row of buttons in\nour daily life? These vehicles are inherently alien to the human condition. They\nmust be strictly defined and explained\nwithin a particular context in order for\nthem to bear fruit.\nWhat we propose is to investigate and\ndevelop a more intuitive and natural way\nto create music, a way to bring out each\nindividual\u2019s intrinsic desire to create\nIf you want to share a\nmind-blowing playlist send\nit in to\nmusic.felix@gmail.com\nMr. Scruff has a freaky sense of humour.

In\nso doing we wish to connect a person\nto their creative instincts via an entirely\nnon-invasive electronic interface and\nexpose the potential for creative abstraction not often associated with rigid\ntechnology. In order to do this we must\nfirst observe the successes and failures\nof traditional as well as modern musical\ninstruments, and consider the opinions\nof musicians as well as non-musicians\nwith an inclination towards music.\nWe believe there is a better method for\ninteracting with machines, especially in\ncreative contexts. It is important to identify and establish the right language for\ncommunication between the object and\nthe subject in question so that we may\nuse technology to realise our ideas and\nvisions.\nWe hope to have a finished prototype\nwithin the next year.

I\u2019m on the full Imperial bursary\nas well as the government grant and have\nbeen for my whole time at university.\nWould you have been able to come to\nImperial without the bursary?\nMaybe, obviously living in London is\nexpensive but the bursary makes things a\nlot easier. It means that I\u2019m able to have a\nflexible student life, for example in terms\nof living with friends after 1st year, I\ndidn\u2019t have as many constraints on who I\ncould live with or where I could live. But\nin terms of coming to Imperial, I imagine\nthat people who don\u2019t have parental support find it just as difficult, even though\nthey don\u2019t qualify for a bursary.\nThe bursary means\nI don\u2019t have to\nconstantly worry\nabout money\nPeter Roberts talks\nto Kadhim Shubber\nabout how the College\u2019s\nStudent Support Bursary\nmakes life easier\nFinancial Emergencies\nHow the College can help you if\nyou\u2019re facing financial trouble\nWe need the money no\nDebt reduction rejected as students point to living costs, not hi\nA majority \u2013 60% of the 460 students\nthat responded to the survey \u2013 said that\nthey preferred cash bursaries to either\nlower accommodation costs or tuition\nfee waivers. The survey was only targeted at the 1261 students who receive\nfinancial aid.\nOne survey respondant said that tuition fee reductions \u201cwould be a complete waste\u201d, adding \u201cIt is the upfront\ncost of living that deters poorer students\nfrom higher education, not tuition fees.\u201d\nUnion President Alex Kendall said that\nwhilst he \u201cunderstood\u201d the government\u2019s point of view, it was clear that\nthe best way to help poorer students was\nthrough cash bursaries.\nAt present, Imperial College offers\nmany forms of financial aid to its undergraduates and postgraduates. It spends\n\u00a34.5 million annually on bursaries for\nstudents from households with an income lower than \u00a350,000. \u00a34 million of\nthis comes from Home/EU tuition fee\nincome (equating to 17.5%), whist the\nother \u00a3500,000 comes from the College\nEndowment Fund.\nThe Student Financial Support (SFS)\nteam, which comprises of only four\nmembers of staff, manages the distribution of this money (and other funds) to\nstudents. The survey showed high satisfaction with the SFS team, with over\n90% rating the service as \u2018good\u2019 or \u2018excellent\u2019.\nWith the increase in tuition fees to\n\u00a39,000, the College\u2019s bursary system is\nbeing reviewed, with Union President\nAlex Kendall calling the new bursary\nsystem \u201cmuch more generous\u201d. Plans\ninclude raising the threshold for bursa-ries to households with incomes of up to\n\u00a360,000 instead of the current \u00a350,000,\nas well as some tuition fee reductions for\npoorer students.\nAlex Kendall confirmed that there\nwould be some reduction in tuition\nfees, not only because of pressure from\nthe government, but also to show the\nuniversity\u2019s willingness to address the\nproblem of debt deterrence. He said that\nthe amount paid to students would not\ndecrease. However, the results of the\nsurvey also suggest that the College still\nhas work to do to ensure that prospective students are aware of the financial\naid that they are eligible to receive.\nIt found that almost 25% of those\nsurveyed had no knowledge of the\nbursary system before applying. 10%\nonly found out about the bursary system after arriving at Imperial.

Whilst I still ap-plied, I suspect Imperial\u2019s reputation\nas an expensive university might put\noff potential applicants who were unaware of the bursary.\u201d Clearly, Imperial will have to raise the awareness of\nprospective students about the bursary\nscheme to ensure that it continues to\nIf you suddenly find yourself in financial hardship, for\nexample finding that you\u2019re unable to pay your rent\nfor that month, the College can help you and may\ngive you money (which you don\u2019t have to pay back).\nAs well as the processes described below, they will\nalso provide emergency assistance or loans.

Of course, judging whether your\nhardship is genuine is something that happens when\nyou apply, but they do ask that you\u2019ve explored other\nroutes of financial aid before applying (for example\nif you haven\u2019t signed up for a full student loan, then\nyou can\u2019t apply)\nIf you do qualify for support from the ALF, you will\nreceive between \u00a3100 and \u00a33,500 that you do not\nhave to pay back. There is a thorough application\nprocess, however.

Indeed, the film is at its strongest\ndocumenting the Chauceresque hijinks common to bands of pilgrims: joking, drinking, and\n\u2018living off the land\u2019 (aka thieving). Such lightness of touch is welcome in what is at heart\na serious story, and it must be said that Sheen\nacquits himself superbly in a challenging role.\nHis decades of Hollywood experience are almost visible on his face in every shot, whether\nplaying for laughs, intensely emoting, or even\n\u2013 every actor\u2019s toughest test \u2013 playing drunk.\nUnfortunately though, The Way is well-intentioned, admirable even, but significantly\nflawed. The direction is formulaic, perhaps\nreflecting the repetitive structure of the hiking\nroutine but in truth suggesting a lack of imagi-Emilio Estevez wrote, directed and appears in\nThe Way, so it\u2019s fair to say that this \u2013 his seventh film as director \u2013 is a markedly personal\neffort. Set on the route of medieval Christian\npilgrimage the Camino de Santiago de Compostela, it was filmed on location in Spain with\na small crew and stars Estevez\u2019s father Martin\nSheen. This good-hearted, earnest effort was\neven inspired by the director\u2019s own Camino\nwith his son.\nSheen plays Tom, a widowed ophthalmologist shocked out of his comfortable day-to-day\nexistence by the freak death of his son (Este-vez) in the Pyrenees on the first leg of the jour-ney. Upon arrival in France to identify the body\nClassic Cinema\nMake Music Mine\nMake Mine Music is an interesting piece of cinema,\nfirmly rooted in its own specific time and enjoyable\n\u2013 with a pinch of salt. On limited release in 1946,\nas the first in a series of \u2018Package Films\u2019 made by\nDisney as a way of keeping its studio going in the\nresource-stretched wartime, this feature length film\nis a collection of ten musical segments that presents popular music of the time in short animated\ntales. It is like Fantasia for the forties but, unlike the\nclassical music of Fantasia that found its own niche\nin which to remain timeless and lauded, Make Mine\nMusic\u2019s soundtrack has dated quickly.\nIt is, nevertheless, a classic slice of Americana,\nshowcasing the talents of Benny Goodman, The Andrews Sisters and Dinah Shore among other big forties names that have, for the most part, been lost\nover the decades. Its stories revolve around small-town baseball games, and teens dancing to jukebox\nhits at the \u201cMalt Shop\u201d in a compilation of what are\nnow nostalgic little snippets. Though this may sound\nentirely un-relatable, or even unbearable for some,\nMake Mine Music has the advantage of being created right in the middle of Disney\u2019s heyday. It remains\ncharming with its meticulous hand-drawn animation\nthat has lost out to the mightier Pixar Studios in recent times, and the simple creativity found in this \u2013\nstill only Disney\u2019s eighth feature film \u2013 is appealing.\nSome of the content has to be taken with a pinch\nof salt, however, with the fat girl being hilariously\nshunned at the dance until she is re-drawn thinner\nand the occasional appearance from a blacked-up\nminstrel sending shudders of 21st Century social\nsensitivity down the spines of the audience at the\nBFI. Still, Make Mine Music is a curious production\nthat encapsulates 1940s America in an entertaining\nand unique way.\nJade Hoffman\nDancing clarinets? Oh shit the acid\u2019s kicking in!\nFriday 18 march 2011\nnation \u2013 for instance, you can set your watch by\nwhen an aerial-shot walking montage is coming up. The script, too, is clunky, especially in\nthe opening 15 minutes of lame exposition in\nwhich Sheen is clumsily introduced playing a\nround of golf with his similarly knitwear-clad\ncountry club buddies. And after he receives\nthe bad news, his relationship with his late son\nis too-briefly summarised via the medium of\nmelodramatic TV-movie flashbacks.\nWorse still, at points it feels like Estevez\nwants us to celebrate the simple humanity of\nno more than a cast of borderline-offensive\ncontinental stereotypes. The film deals almost\nexclusively in them: the laid-back Dutchman\nwho likes a crafty \u2018schmoke\u2019, the old Spaniard\nwho \u2018always wanted to be a matador\u2019, and the\ntwinkly-eyed boozy Irish poet.

    "content": "FELIX friday 18 march 2011 13\nFEATURES\nCampus. For over twelve years now, he\nhas been studying roundabouts in Bracknell, treating the roundabouts like small\nislands of green in a sea of tarmac and\nconcrete. Dr Leather had this to say on\nthe subject: \u201cAt the beginning, I started\nlooking at roundabouts as purely an academic exercise, but I soon realised that it\nwas a great way of getting people interested in Urban Ecology. There is a huge\nabundance of wildlife which thrives on\nroundabouts; I like to think of them as\nurban nature reserves\u201d.\nDr Leather is somewhat sceptical\nabout the extent to which green spaces\nin cities and ideas such as vertical gardens and skyscraper farms can help reduce atmospheric carbon dioxide levels.\nHe argues that, although most of the\nworld\u2019s population now lives in urban\nareas, the actual area our towns and cities take up on the globe is still relatively\nsmall. As such, Dr Leather believes that\ngreen areas in cities are unlikely to ever\nmake a significant impact in reducing\natmospheric carbon dioxide levels. Instead, he argues: \u201cGreen spaces in urban\nareas are much more about mitigating\nthe effects of climate change, rather than\ntackling its causes. Large green spaces\nin cities can actually help reduce the\ntemperature a small amount.\u201d According\nto Dr Leather, the two main benefits of\ngreen spaces in urban areas are undoubtedly preserving biodiversity and reducing flood risk: \u201cPeople are constantly\ntarmacking over their gardens so they\nhave a place to park their cars and this\nleads to significantly reduced run-off\ntimes when it rains. Maintaining green\nspaces can help us avoid this problem\u201d.\nHowever, the benefits of urban ecology don\u2019t end here. Dr Leather argues that\ngreen spaces can also have a massive affect on human psychology: \u201cTrees can\nmake you feel calm and peaceful; research has shown that people who drive\nto work along streets lined with trees\ntend to arrive at work in a happier frame\nof mind than those who drive to work\nalong streets without any greenery\u201d. In\naddition, the ability of trees to improve\nour mood manifests itself in economic\nterms: \u201cIf you have two similar streets,\none with trees on it and one without, the\nhouses on the streets with trees are likely\nto be worth significantly more\u201d.\nThe effects of urban ecology on our\nhuman psychology is a subject which\nProfessor Nigel Bell of the Imperial College Centre for Environmental\nPolicy has also looked into closely. He\nsays: \u201cgreen spaces are certainly good\nfor people\u2019s mental well-being; it has\nbeen shown that giving hospital patients\na view of green space from their window can actually improve their chances\nof recovery\u201d.\nHowever, Professor Bell\u2019s main area\nof interest is air pollution. Air pollution\ncauses around 4,500 premature deaths\nin London each year. Professor Bell has\npublished a number of papers on how\nair pollutants, produced by cars and\nindustry affect our urban ecology. He\nbelieves: \u201cLondon probably has more\ngreen space than any other city in Europe; it\u2019s really important that we have\nthis vegetation to help filter out these air\npollutants\u201d.\nIn 1993, Professor Bell chaired a review group on urban environmental\nscience. In a report which Professor\nBell himself describes as \u201cpretty damming\u201d, he argues: \u201cOver 90% of British\npeople live in towns and cities, yet the\ngovernment has no department directly\nresponsible for urban areas \u2013 this seems\nludicrous to me\u201d.\nYet, Professor Bell isn\u2019t just concerned with urban ecology in London,\nor even just in the UK. He has also\nlooked at the effects of air pollution\nin cities in India, including Delhi and\nVaranasi. He argues that this is a huge\nproblem which needs to be tackled:\n\u201cAir pollution has a major effect on urban agriculture, it dramatically reduces\nyields. But this problem is not even\nrecognised by the Indian government\u201d.\nAccording to Professor Bell, it is mainly people who have small subsistence\nfarms in these urban areas who suffer\nas a result. As with many of the issues\nsurrounding urban pollution, he argues:\n\u201cit is once again the poorest of the poor\nwho end up suffering most\u201d.\nThus, our ability to protect urban ecology is not only of paramount importance\nfor protecting plant and animal biodiver-sity, it also plays a vital role in improving the quality of our lives too.\nGuerrilla\nGardening\nWhat the hell is \u2018guerrilla gardening\u2019? Although the term was\nfirst coined in New York in the\nseventies, \u2018guerrilla gardeners\u2019\nhave actually been active in\nthe UK since the 17th century.\nPut simply, \u2018guerrilla gardeners\u2019\nare people who garden other\npeople\u2019s land without permis-sion. The motivations for doing\nthis can be diverse: the \u2018guerrillas\u2019 may simply be gardening to\nimprove the aesthetic qualities\nof land neglected by its legal\nowner, or it may be politically\nmotivated. Either way, \u2018guerrilla\ngardening\u2019 is usually kept top\nsecret and is often carried out\nunder the cover of darkness.\nBack in 2004, Richard Reynolds from London set up a blog\ndetailing his \u2018guerilla gardening\u2019\nactivities. Initially, he was just\na frustrated gardener who decided to spruce up a neglected\ncouncil block in Southwark. But\nhis exploits have now inspired\n\u2018guerrilla gardening\u2019 activists\nall over the globe. In 2008 he\npublished a book about \u2018guerrilla gardening\u2019, which details\nthe activities of \u2018cells\u2019 in thirty\ndifferent countries.\nFeel inspired? New York\u2019s\n\u2018Green Guerillas\u2019 used to use\nsimple \u2018seed grenades\u2019 to help\nthem do their illicit gardening\nactivities back in the seven-ties. You can make your own\n\u2018seed grenade\u2019 by following\nthese simple steps:\nStep 1: Get one of the condoms still in your drawer from\nFresher\u2019s Fair (be honest)\nStep 2: Fill the condom with\nwildflower seeds, water and\nfertiliser (no, not that sort)\nStep 3: Toss the condom\nover a fence onto neglected\nland\nWARNING: Do not reuse these\ncondoms for sexual purposes\n\u2013 this may lead to genital rag-worts\n\u201cResearch has\nshown that people\nwho drive to work\nalong streets\nlined with trees\ntend to arrive at\nwork in a happier\nframe of mind\nthan those who\ndrive to work along\nstreets without any\ngreenery.\u201d\nMagdalena Paczkowski\n\n"

The fully upgraded model has been garnering some serious\nattention from reviewers over the week, with\nthe almost unanimous conclusion being that the\ndevice delivers exactly what was promised on\nthe tin, if not more.\nWith many reviewers having stripped the\ntablet down to its innards, it\u2019s been found\nto pack a 900 Mhz dual-core ARM chip and\nanother dual-core processor in the form of\nImagination Technologies\u2019 GPU. The integrated performance of both chips has managed to blow away standard benchmarks used\nfor judging graphics performance, both when\ncompared to the original iPad and to other\nsimilar competition.\nReviewers are so far reporting that the latest incarnation of the slate manages anywhere\nbetween 50 \u2013 65 frames/second under the GLBenchmark for graphical performance. This\nis in comparison to the original iPad\u2019s performance of between 15-20 frames/second and the\nMotorola Xoom\u2019s 25-30 frames. Admittedly,\nthe Xoom is running on a slightly higher resolution than the iPad 2, but the figures indicate a\nperformance gap that can\u2019t be explained by the\nfewer pixels on screen.\nThe latest reviews will be worrying for Apple\u2019s competitors. Unlike the mobile market,\nwhere Android handsets have proved more\nthan able to match and improve upon Apple\u2019s\niPhone, there has been little to indicate that they\nhave anything new to offer in the tablet market,\ndespite having a year to plan a response.\nFor much of 2010, the iPad was the only\nviable option for those looking for a quality\ntablet. While many Windows tablets were announced at trade fairs, there were none to be\nseen on sale; Android tablets proved relatively\nnumerous but also relatively poor, seeming\nFree App of the Week\niOS - Radio Player\nThe iPhone might not come equipped with a radio\ntuner, but as they say, there\u2019s an app for that: Radio\nPlayer.

Ad-supported, free radio sorted.\nAndroid - TuneIn Radio\niPad 2 blows away rivals\nFeroz Salam\nSlipcases are pretty standard fare for laptop\nprotection these days. From the cheap and\ncheerful to the leather-clad, there\u2019s a slipcase to\nsuit every taste and budget.\nThe LA robe for Apple\u2019s MacBook Pro line\nfrom be.ez fits into the middle range of slipcas-es. It incorporates some fancy Low Resistance\nPolyurathane (LRPu) foam into a fairly standard zippered slipcase design. The foam absorbs impact energy by freely deforming under\nload, reducing the amount of energy that can\npass through to your laptop. It\u2019s different from\nother foam in that it puts up less resistance to\ndeformation and therefore absorbs more of the\nimpact energy.\nIn practice this means that it dents easily and\nthen slowly recovers to its original formation\nKeep scratches at bay the LA robe rose\nSamuel Gibbs\nlargely like outsized Android handsets (to a\nmuch greater extent than the iPad).\nEarly 2011 brought announcements of Motorola\u2019s Xoom slate, the first tablet that would\nsport Android\u2019s tablet-oriented Honeycomb\nOS. Powered by a dual-core chip and some\nhighly promising graphics, there was high\nexpectation that the device could finally be a\nworthwhile response to the iPad.\nYet any progress the Xoom has made has\nprobably been undone over the last few weeks.\nThe device was more expensive than most\nreviewers were expecting and on the back of\nthe quality performance by the iPad 2, including the addition of the cameras the device was\nsorely lacking before, it\u2019s hard to see why customers looking to buy a tablet wouldn\u2019t choose\nApple.\nThe increased graphical performance of the\niPad also means that the devices have more to\noffer gamers, with the larger screen giving a\nmuch wider range of interface options for de-velopers, now with the ability to display pretty\npictures too. It\u2019s definitely not the focus of the\ndevice, but it will be interesting to see how\nquickly developers pick up on the possibilities\nof the platform.\nIt\u2019s not all doom and gloom for the Xoom\nthough: with 4G capabilities and working\nFlash on the way, it\u2019s still got much to offer\nthat the iPad doesn\u2019t. Apple\u2019s App Market\nand software distribution system still suffers\nfrom the same lock-in problems that Android\ndoesn\u2019t, and Android keeps it\u2019s usual edge on\ncustomisability.\nThe issue of picking between the tablets\nseems to boil down to the regular question of\nfreedom versus user experience. The iPad 2\nappears to have been tailored for a quick and\nneat user experience, with enough similarity to\nthe old iPad to keep the learning curve shallow\nyet enough behind-the-scenes improvements\nto deliver a noticeably better experience. The\ncompetition is going to have to do a lot better\nbefore they can even consider wooing consumers away from Apple.\nonce the load is removed, which can be pretty\ndisconcerting when you first start using the\ncase, but does work as described.\nThe case is designed to fit specific models\nranging from the 15-inch MacBook Pro to the\n13-inch polycarbonate MacBook, however in\nour testing with the 13-inch MacBook Pro, the\nfit wasn\u2019t snug enough for our liking, meaning\nthat the laptop moved around inside the case\nrather a lot. The lining of the case is soft velvet,\nso perhaps this isn\u2019t too much of an issue, but\nwe would have preferred a better fit given the\nmodel specificity that be.ez claims.\nIf you\u2019re putting your laptop in a regular\nbackpack, this slipcase might do the trick, but\nwithout any sort of cable storage or handle, it\u2019s\nnot going to be all that useful on its own. We\nliked the LRPu foam, but the LA robe certainly\ndidn\u2019t fit well enough for a simple slipcase.\nI still think anyone with a tablet looks like a massive prick\nFriday 18 March 2011\n16\n\n"

    "content": "Jackie\u2019s own approval is harrowing to watch.\nYet, there are also some excellent humorous\nmoments, particularly the physical comedy of\nthe picnic for great-grandmother\u2019s birthday\nand the spontaneous song of the children with\nits refrain of \u201cwhen I grow up I want to be a\nhairdresser \u2013 or a housewife!\u201d accompanied by\nSpice Girls-style dance moves, darkly reflecting on the poverty of their ambitions.\nThe acting was certainly of a better quality\nthan I had expected from such a small theatre\nbut demonstrated why the Finborough Theatre\nis the Stage 100\u2019s Fringe Theatre of the Year.\nThis play is the first of six in the \u201cIn Their\nPlace\u201d season which will showcase the work of\nfemale playwrights over the next three months.\nFen is certainly a promising start.\nFELIX\nArts Editor: Rox Middleton\nFenimism with flair\nFen kicks off a showcase of female playwrights in Fulham\nMy first impressions on entering the Finborough Theatre, having climbed the stairs from\nthe wine bar below, were dubious. The middle\nof the theatre was covered in earth, liberally\nstrewn with potatoes, the room hummed with\neerie folky music and for a good five minutes\nan actress in farmer\u2019s garb darted from side to\nside, shaking her rattle at imaginary birds.\nDespite this unportentious start, Fen far exceeded my expectations. I have never seen\na play by Caryl Churchill before and I was\nstruck by how brilliantly she writes from life.\nShe is able to get right inside the heads of nasty children, bullying stepmothers and converts\nto Jesus and perfectly captures a sometimes\ninfuriating irrationality and pettiness in her\ndialogue.\nThe play is set in the 1980s in the English\nFens. The people have little money and fewer\nchoices. Churchill is unashamedly socialist\nand feminist in her views and her characters\nmake an excellent case for her principles. The\nwomen\u2019s monotonous work out on the cold,\ndark earth speaks for their cold, grim lives.\nThey have no money, no avenue of escape and\nso they attempt to lose themselves in religion\nor forbidden love, but solace always evades\nthem.\nThe damned-ness of Val, a young mother\nwhose only three choices are to leave her chil-dren, to tear them away from their father or\nto live without love highlights the particular\nway in which women become trapped by early\nchoices and forever held in place by a web of\ninterdependencies and the fixed mindsets of\ntheir community.\nSeveral of the female characters in this play\nare not much older than I am (Val\u2019s mother remarks that she was a grandmother at 36) and\nyet I largely felt that the themes explored were\ntoo mature for me to be able to properly em-pathise. I certainly left feeling grateful to live\nin a liberated society and to be allowed to be\nyoung and female but still free.\nJust as impressive as the writing is the ability\nof the six actors, five female and one male, to\ninhabit the vast range of roles: from Japanese\nbusiness man to petulant six year old. I was\nespecially impressed by the mostly flawless\nNorfolk accents. On the other hand, I felt having only one male actor was a weakness, as he\nfound it hard to make the adjustment between\nthe male romantic lead and the curmudgeonly\nold farm owner role.\nThe maliciousness of Nicola Harrison\u2019s\nJackie as she psychologically tortures her vulnerable step-child and derides her craving for\nChristina Flanagan\nAmateur serpents and super amorists\nI was apprehensive when I heard that, because\nthe budget would not allow for period costume,\nthis production was to be a contemporary version of the opera. That is not to say I know anything about opera, but for me part of its appeal\nis the historic context and atmosphere that it\nexudes. However, I was very pleasantly proven\nwrong.\nThe opening scene of the traditional opera\nshows our gallant hero Tamino, the height of\nprincely handsomeness battling a ferocious\nserpent. Again, for budget reasons this was\nactually a man in a shoddy dinosaur costume.\nInterspersed between the powerful operatic\ntenors opening notes were unenthusiastic roars\nthat had the audience in stitches.\nThe plot was too complex to be fittingly\nsummarised here, but essentially the dashing\nprince falls in love with the daughter of the\nQueen of the Night, who turns out to be evil\n(I think they ought to have guessed by the\nname).\nAfter an attempt to save the daughter and\nseveral convoluted plot lines, kidnapping, becoming monks (etc. etc.) he and his lazy half-man-half-bird friend succeed in eliminating the\nevil queen and getting married. All in time for\na late afternoon cup of tea.\nThe performance was excellent and managed\nto be entertaining for two hours even though\nwe were sitting on hard church pews.

The novel itself,\nas though keeping a promise, salutes life, with all\nits wondrous moments and tragedies.\nVan narrates the action, which commences when\nhe is 14 and visiting the home of his aunt and cous-ins. Here he meets for the first time his cousin ( and\nsister) wilful Ada Veen, 12, and falls as irrevocably\nin love with her as she eventually does with him\nthat same summer.

Their brief, but always passionate meetings\nthroughout time are a testimony to their incredible\nlove.\nNabokov in \u2018Ada\u2019 has invented two universes. Antiterra, in which the characters live and interact, is\nnot too far removed from our own. Its counterpart,\nTerra the Fair, is where the characters dream and\nsometimes go mad. The time periods of each world\noverlap so that in Antiterra, planes whizz about, but\ncars are interchangeable with horses in the 19th\nand early 20th centuries.\nNabokov integrates both universes with each other and with our own naturally and gracefully so that\ndates are both meaningful and meaningless in that\nthey exemplify the passage of time whilst breaking\ndown its straight trajectory.\n\u2018Ada\u2019 is written in magical prose that reads and\nflows like poetry. Nabokov fills the novel with allu-sions, wordplays and puzzles that mirror Van and\nAda\u2019s youthful first summer. The supporting characters in Van\u2019s life are masterfully sketched and Nabokov inserts and removes them from the narrative\nwith skill; their part in the tale is never forgotten.\n\u2018Ada\u2019 can also read as a philosophical examination\nof time, which Van is forever trying to understand.\nBut above all, \u2018Ada\u2019 is an astounding love story that\nleaves one with a lust for life, imagination and the\nbeauty of words.\n\u201cNabokov treats both\nincest and age in such a\ncasually erotic tone that all\ninhibitions are completely\nrelinquished\u201d\nCrouching in the mud.

    "content": "W KILEAKS\nS\nince Wikileaks published\ntheir first leak in 2006, it\nhas grown to become one of\nthe most controversial website in the world. Wikileaks\nlubricated the whistle-blowing cog,\nresulting in a Cambrian explosion of\nleaks in the past couple of years via\ntheir website. Some leaks are mere objects of amusement, like the publication\nof the secret handbooks of American\nuniversity fraternities (frat boys despair as their secret handshakes are no\nlonger secret). Some, like the Collateral\nMurder video footages and Cablegate,\ntriggered widespread socio-political\ndebates. Wikileaks leads the charge for\nmore transparency but the irony is that\nthe organization itself is rather opaque.\nThat is until last month, when Danieal\nDomscheit-Berg, the ex-spokesperson\nand former second-in-command of\nWikileaks, published Inside Wikileaks,\nthe account of his time at the \u201cworld\u2019s\nmost dangerous website.\u201d\nPart memoir, part expose, Inside\nWikileaks traces Daniel\u2019s time with the\norganization from its infancy until September 2010, when Daniel and a group\nof Wikileaks dissidents left. Daniel\nfirst met Julian Assange, the enigmatic\nfounder of Wikileaks at a hacker conference at which he had arranged for Julian\nto speak. Back then Daniel had a full\ntime job in designing network security\nat a large American company, and was\nactively involved in the open source\ncommunity.\nJulian, though unknown publicly during then, was regarded in high esteem\nby Daniel. The lanky Australian standing at the podium, addressing a dismal\nturnout of less than twenty, had a reputation in hacking circles. Going by the\npseudonym of \u2018Mendax\u2019, he was one of\nthe \u2018International Subversives\u2019, a trio of\nhigh-profile hackers, and the co-author\nof the hacking cult classic Underground:\nHacking, Madness and Obsession on the\nElectronic Frontier. Julian has his share\nof battle scars as well, being convicted\nin Australia for 25 hacking charges, narrowly escaping jail term on account of\nhis disrupted upbringing. The man with\nthe wispy platinum hair was a hacking\nsuperstar.\nDaniel had his first taste of its power\nwhen he dealt with the Bank Julius Baer\nleak. The documents detailed the SwedPOLITICS\nFELIX 19\nteam working on Wikileaks full time\nconsisted of less than five people. Julian\nrole-played multiple characters when it\ncame to external correspondence to give\nthe impression that Wikileaks was a formidable organization.\nThe state-of-the-art encryption technology Wikileaks employ to protect the\nanonymity of the whistle-blowers is so\nsophisticated that only a few programmers in the world could design it but\nthe unnamed architect left together with\nDaniel and took with him together the\ncodes. They both now work on OpenLeaks, a new whistle-blowing website\nless focused on sensational leaks targeted at the US.\nInside Wikileaks focuses on the story\nof Wikileaks rather than the technical\nside, making it widely accessible. It is\ngenerally well paced, and it is spattered\nwith plenty of humourous anecdotes\nabout Julian Assange\u2019s eccentricities\nlike how Daniel psychoanalyzed Julian\u2019s character from the way Julian\ndances in a club. Following the success\nof David Fincher\u2019s The Social Network,\nDreamworks optioned Inside Wikileaks\nto be made into a feature film. However, sometimes Daniel\u2019s rapid assault\non Julian\u2019s character, down to the most\ntrivial idiosyncrasies, makes one feel\nthat the book is written to get back at\nJulian \u2013 whining that Julian drank all\nhis cocoa powder probably should not\nhave gotten into the book). It is worth\na read if you would like a peek into\nthe workings of Wikileaks and spend a\nday with Julian Assange. Maybe when\nJulian Assange publishes his autobiography late this year, we would be able\nto hear the other side of the story and\nhopefully more hilarious eccentricities\nof Julian.\nFriday 18 march 2011\nA BOOK\nREVIEW BY\nGUO HENG CHIN\nLEAKING\na large rucksack. The two freedom (of\ninformation) fighters developed a genuine camaraderie working together on\nWikileaks, and Daniel became Julian\u2019s\nconfidante. However their relationship\nwould eventually unravel in the likes of\nMark Zuckerberg and Eduardo Saverin\nduring the dramatic founding of Facebook.\nJulian Assange is a figure that intrigues as much as he is admired. He\nstyles himself as \u201cfounder, philosopher,\nspokesperson, original coder, organizer,\nfinancier and all the rest\u201d of Wikileaks,\na lengthy title reminiscent of a British\nmonarch. Julian is an idealist championing for a more open world, but at the\nsame time kept Wikileaks\u2019 finances and\nadministration secret from the public.\nDaniel accuses him of running a dictatorship at Wikileaks and compares the\ncult-like organization of Wikileaks to\nthat of the Church of Scientology, of\nwhose secret bible they leaked in 2008.\nAs the leaks got more controversial and\nattracted more media attention Julian\nbegan to become suspicious that Daniel\nwas seeking to replace him.\nJulian Assange is known to be on the\nparanoid end of the spectrum. He attributes his nomadic lifestyle to avoiding\nsurveillance from the enemies he ac-crued. He also points a finger at a US\nconspiracy to smear him when he was\ncharged with sexual crimes in Sweden.\nOn the other hand, Julian carries with\nhim a certain charisma. Perhaps his\nmagnetism comes from the fact that he\nis a rebel with a cause. An Oxford University student who volunteered with\nWikileaks likened him to the Pied Piper,\nattracting followers over the Internet\nwith the maverick tune he plays.\nWhen Daniel first got onboard, the\n[Domscheit-Berg]\ncompares the cult-like organization of\nWikileaks to that\nof the Church of\nScientology\nish private financial institution\u2019s elaborate tax evasion scheme that involved\nexploiting a complex subsidiary system\nand shoring funds on Cayman Islands.\nInjunctions procured by the company\nlawyers and furious threats failed to take\ndown Wikileaks, giving Daniel his first\ntaste of victory over Goliath.\nInside Wikileaks is as much a story\nabout Julian Assange as it is about the\nstructural cogs and gears of Wikileaks,\nas Daniel had the rare chance of spending months with Julian Assange. At the\nsame time of the Julius Baer leak, Julian\nmoved in with Daniel. Julian does not\nhave a permanent address and leads a\nnomadic lifestyle, relying on the goodwill of supporters for a bed to bunk in,\nand carries all his worldly possessions in\n\u201c Stills of footage fom leaked US Military video showing the killing of Reuters journalists and civilians\nJulian Assange and Daniel Domscheit-Berg\n\n"

As\namazing as this genre of music is, what\nis special about it is its ability to bring\npeople of different backgrounds to-gether. The gospel music sung by the\nIC Gospel Choir is much more than\nthe dynamic music, the syncopated\nrhythms and the passionate performances - it is very close to the choirs\u2019\nheart and our lives.\nSo after weeks of dedication, hard\nwork and preparation, led by Music Director Kadisha West and accompanied\nby the freshly established and soulful\nImperial College Gospel Choir Band\n(led by Leonard Aidoo Micah), the IC\nmosphere as the students in the choir\nsang a mixture of songs from the heart.\nSome of these included \u2018God Great God\u2019\nby gospel artist Kurt Carr; an enthusiastic song with intricate harmonies that\nhad the whole audience on their feet as\nthe line between the stage and the audience became invisible.\nOther acts on the night included a contemporary dance piece performed by the\nMOCA group Gospel Glee Project and\nthe talented and energetic Kings College Gospel Music Society\u2019s Choir with\nwhich the IC Gospel Choir sung the final\nsong, Total Praise. All the proceeds from\nthe concert were donated to the Rahab\nProject in Earls Court who reach out to\nthe working girls of the area and try to\nprovide a way out of the sex industry for\nthem.\nThe choir has come a long way since\nI joined two years ago and what I love\nabout it is the miracle that could be easily overlooked of strangers coming together and encouraging one another as\na family. Proverbs 18:21 says that \u201cthe\ntongue has the power of life & death\u201d\nand for us, the life that the music we\nsing brings is relevant to every sphere\nof our lives. Singing gospel is actively\npracticing what it says in Psalms 150:6\n\u201cLet everything that has breath, praise\nthe Lord!\u201d and I have it on good word\nthat even the mice in the vestiges of the\nClore Lecture theatre were getting their\ngroove on!\nAs the newly elected Music Director I\nlook forward to meeting more amazing\npeople and seeing the scope of the choir\nbroaden. My vision is for the heart of the\nGospel to be heard in our singing & that\nmany more within the IC community\nwill hear, experience and take part in the\njoy of singing gospel music.\nAs Imperial turns to exam season and\nthe pressure mounts, the words of a song\ncalled \u2018My Help\u2019 we sang seem appro-priate; they simply say \u201cAll of my help\ncomes from the Lord!\u201d I hope it encourages you!

We arrived at Mayhem Paintball in the morning. Bernard\nSunley, Tizzard and Parsons Halls combined to form a compact team of only\n11 people called The Blues, vastly outnumbered by the other 3 teams with\neach over 20 people. Wilson wore silver,\na colour Wilsonites associated with vic-tory. Pembridge were taped with \u2018fragile\u2019- would they live up to their name?\nBeit had yellow and black striped tape: a\nwarning to others \u2013 or themselves?\nThe first two matches were Wilson vs.\nPembridge and Beit vs. The Blues. The\nWilson / Pembridge match took place on\na vast field with many obstacles including a log barricade, which turned out to\nbe the crucial pivoting point during the\ngame. The objective is to capture the\nflag. Wilson started uphill, having two\nlarge flanking groups lead by none other\nthan George Georgio and Tom Alpe,\nveterans of the game. Pembridge had a\nstrong flat line defense, which was holding Wilson down, until Scott Esnouf and\nLee Sewell sneaked in through the barri-cade. Scott made home with the flag for\ntheir first victory. Another solid game\nfrom Wilson gave them a 2-0 win over\nPembridge, who graciously in defeat\npraised Wilson\u2019s tactics and players. The\nBeit match was hotly contested despite\nthe Blues being outnumbered 11 to 21.\nThe Blues managed a draw for the first\nScott Esnouf\nmatch, but eventually lost the second\nmatch to Beit.\nThe next matches took place in the\nmost popular arena: Urban. This close\nquarters combat requires lots of balls.\nFirst up Wilson vs. The Blues. Sadly,\nThe Blue\u2019s determination, bravery and\ngrit couldn\u2019t hold off the Wilsonites and\nthey lost the two games. Next up was\nPembridge vs. Beit, who took one game\neach, both with the strategy of taking,\nholding and pushing from the critical\nbarn. Wilson had 4 wins, Beit and Pembridge were tied for second, and The\nBlues with their limited numbers but\nskillful players had 1 draw and 3 losses.\nFor the final matches,Pembridge faced\noff against the Blues in the dense forest of Aeroplane Wood while Beit vs.\nWilson took place in Bridge Wood. The\nBlues started strong against Pembridge,\nusing their skill to pin down the greater\nnumbers of Pembridge and pick off those\nwho dared run or peak from a barricade.\nThis strong start gradually diminished\nas the Blues went low on ammo, giving\nPembridge a chance to push towards the\nAeroplane, where they were able to keep\nthe Blues at bay to take the draw. For\nthe next game, The Blue\u2019s ammo was at\ncritical level and they gave it their best\nshot, but Pembridge were too much for\nthem and they lost the second game, but\nnot without a fight. An exceptional last\nditch effort by The Blues captain, who\ntook 5 enemies before being shot.\nThe confident Wilson did not let their\nguard down against Beit. Eventually,\nWilson grabbed their 5th win. With Wilson losing only 3 players in the game,\nBeit were in a very sour mood and\nthrew rash insults at Wilson. Wilson\nkept quiet, knowing how they would\ntake revenge for these accusations. The\nnext game was a chance for Beit to stop\nWilson taking home the Championship\nwith a whitewash, but they failed to do\nso. A huge sprinting start by the entire\nWilson team put them in forward posi-tions. Skillful Wilson players shot down\nany Beit player who dared to peek from\ntheir barricades. Javier and Scott made a\nsuicidal dash to the flag and would have\nbeen gunned down by the remaining two\nplayers of Beit, had it not been for Claire\nLynn\u2019s superb cover fire. The Spanish\nsteed that is Javier desired nothing but\nglory, hence he sprinted for the flag covered by Scott who made a crucial pick on\nthe second last Beit player..Javier dived\nand slid feet first across a mud patch\nwhile gunning down the last Beit player,\ngrabbing the flag and running home for\nthe best ever score in inter-hall paintball.\nBeit were very sore second place losers.\nPembridge graciously accepted a joint\nsecond place and the Blues took the last\nplace.The day ended with a huge battle,\nWilson and the Blues vs Beit and Pembridge \u2013 there were no survivors.\nJoanna Kefas\n\n"

Not because they\nwere impossible to get\nhold of, just something I was unlikely\nto stumble across. And if, like me and\nDaniel Barenboim, you are more immediately interested in the impossible rather than the very difficult or the unlikely,\nperhaps they are not something you have\nyet considered much either. Ever the scientist though, my interest to learn more\nwas primed from conflicting information I had heard about them. The truffle\nis a name applied to both chocolate and\nalso that fungus that is grated or thinly\nsliced onto (savoury) starters and soups.\nManifestly they were not the same and\nso I took my sweet tooth, grabbed the\nchocolate bull by the horns and set about\ntrying to find out more.\nLike most people I have had truffles in\nchocolate selection boxes, especially as\nthose which include truffles start more\nor less a cut above the cheapest ones. I\nfound these a disappointment I\u2019d rather\navoid now: poor-quality chocolate with\na chalky texture and too many nuts. I\ndo like the milk chocolate concoctions\nmore than most of the others, but if it\u2019s\ntoo milky or greasy I can\u2019t say I would\nconsider it for anything other than a\nsource of fuel.\nNext, rather than look up what it\nwas or should be, by chance I came\nacross some much better ones, namely\nthe Pink Marc du Champagne truffles\nfrom Charbonnel et Walker. These are\nquite exquisite, if you can get past the\nfrankly unnecessarily pink presenta-tion. I think that they are sufficiently\nwell put-together that one alone is just\nright. I should say how these are con-structed. They use white chocolate,\nand so do not contain any pure cocoa,\nonly cocoa butter in them. The filling\nis Marc du champagne which is an im-possible-sounding thing really; Marc is\na drink made from the fermentation of\ngrape skins alone, after they have been\nremoved from the wine, or in this case\nchampagne, making process.\nTypically, this is done to supplement\nincome when a bad year drives down\nthe yield of grapes. The same thing\nhappens in Italy but there it is known\nas Grappa, and is perhaps more familiar\nthan Marc, though both are very bitter.\nPink Marc is perhaps unusual as it requires a mixture of both white and red\ngrape skins to make it. Either way, the\nbitterness seems at odds with the white\nchocolate, but in this case it works well\nas it ensures the sweetness and deca-Handcrafted, exquisite little morsels basking in their ruffled paper cases... mmmm\ndence of the butter are reined in and\nso the flavours balance well and are\ndeeper. The trouble is that a box costs\n\u00a310 in the Gloucester Road Waitrose\nand there are only about nine in each\nbox. Personally, however, I consider it\nwell worth it. Pralines are often mixed\nup with truffles, and quite frankly\nthey\u2019re fairly similar. If your experience is like mine, they will also have\nbeen disappointing if not very similar\nto the cheaper truffles noted above.\nThey are supposedly a type of truffle\nwhich does contain nuts; made from\neither almonds or hazelnuts. Normal\ntruffles are made with chocolate mixed\nwith cream or butter and flavoured, typically with a spirit. This is similar to the\nganache used to decorate p\u00e2tisserie in\nwhich chocolate is melted at body temperature before the cream and/or butter\nis mixed with it. I must say that mixing\nchocolate and cream and adding a flavouring sounds rather achievable. Time\nto experiment myself I think...\nI\u2019m not allergic to nuts or anything\nbut I\u2019m not a massive fan either. However, a recent present of chocolates and\nchampagne showed me that truffles or\npralines can be done well with nuts.\nAnd more to the point, milk chocolate.\nTruffles are an indulgence that I shall\nbe thinking twice about now, whether\nit be buying them for myself or others.\nLike all things, especially luxury items,\nspending a bit more and going for the\npacket with the gold embossing ensures\na very satisfactory experience for all.\nSpring fever is fast approaching.

Of course, all this wouldn\u2019t\nhave to happen if you\u2019d just paid attention to the\nAnnual Felix Easter Egg review.\nBut what else is there to eat during Easter apart\nfrom chocolate? A plenty lot more, I tell you. Next\ntime you\u2019re eating a warm hot cross bun, think of\nEostre, the springtime goddess that you\u2019re inadvertently honouring by consuming the bun. Swap your\nnormal Sunday roast to a roast lamb dinner on Easter Sunday, as it is thought that the angel of God will\npass over your home and bring no harm. And if that\nsounds all too surreal, feast your eyes on the pretzel\nand try to imagine the torso of a person with their\narms folded praying. I wonder who George Bush\nimagined as his pretzel when he famously choked\non the snack. Osama Bin Ladan perhaps?\nT\nhis year, it\u2019s all about meat in the\nLondon restaurant scene. Hot\nnew arrivals include pop-up joint\n#Meateasy (New Cross) serving\nminced 28 day aged chuck steak\nburgers, Philly cheesesteaks and other\nNorth American grill classics. Satisfying\nour pure, primitive desire to eat meat provides the comfort that lets us forget about\nthe grim times we\u2019re in. Aside from the new\nfaces, capitalist London is full of legendary gastronomic rivals who strive to outdo\neach other in nothing other than preparing\nthe most exquisite meat. So where\u2019s the\nbeef?\nOh no! The Wafflemeister vouchers\nhave expired!\nFriday 18 march 2011\nEaster smeester!

The\n\u201cHach\u00e9 or Byron\u201d debate has\ndivided Londoners for a few\nyears. If you\u2019re a vegetarian,\nyou\u2019d say Hach\u00e9. Their falafel\nsweetcorn burger with beetroot\nis the only vegetarian dish that\nI\u2019d ever order and has the power\nto salvage any vegetarian-carni-vore relationship. (At Byron the\nveggie option is an oversized\nmushroom wedged between\nbuns.) However, Hach\u00e9\u2019s crucial\nbeef burgers are ironically spoilt\nby their signature ciabatta buns\nthat don\u2019t really work. Nevertheless, they have very strong patty potential. Byron, despite their\npatchy service, makes incredible burgers that are perfectly\nmedium-rare. They\u2019re even better than in Gordon Ramsey\u2019s\nMaze Grill.\nH\nach\u00e9: 329-391 Fulham Road.\nByron: 75 Gloucester Road.\nTHE ALL-YOU-CAN-EAT\nBRAZILIAN BBQ\nAre you looking for a meat\norgy? Or is it meat asphyxi-ation? Head to one of these havens that\u2019ll leave you paralysed\nin pleasure. In the Rodizio, or\nBrazilian barbeque, waiters\nglide from table to table with\nhunks of meat on swords, stopping to carve a pile on your\nplate until you tell them to\nstop. It\u2019s about quality, quan-tity, and variety too. There\u2019s\nstraight-off-the-barbeque beef\nribs, lamb, gammon, chorizo,\nchicken hearts, baby beef and\nmore, which will work you up\ninto a frenzy. You name a cut\nof meat, they\u2019ll have it. If you\nsomehow get bored of the protein monotony, there\u2019s a colossal buffet of Brazilian dishes\nsuch as fritters, feijoada\nstews, rice and salads too. Out\nof the two restaurants, Rodizio\nRico has the edge with their\nwonderfully flavourful, smoky\ncuts of meat and cheerful ser-vice. At \u00a323.50 a head, it might\nfeel slightly pricey but you\u2019ll get\nyour money\u2019s worth if you play\nit right, i.e., fill up on sirloin.\nThere\u2019s a Rodizio Rico branch\nopening in Fulham Broadway\nsoon. Definitely something to\nlook forward to.\nRodizio Rico: 111 Westbourne\nGrove.\nRodizio Preto: 72 Wilton Rd\nRodizio Rico vs Rodizio Preto\nOUR LOCAL FAVOURITE\nBest Mangal vs Bodean\u2019s\nPeople travel miles on their\nbicycles and through zones\non the tube for the best kebab in London at Best Mangal\n(West Kensington). How lucky\nwe are to have the beautifully charred, boldly marinated\nTurkish barbecued meats piled\nhigh, just on our doorstep. The\nmultitudes of Meze dishes are\ncolourful and exotic both in\nappearance and flavour. It\u2019s\na delight to mop up the juices\nwith their homemade breads\nwhether it\u2019s out of the take-away box or off the plate in\ntheir cosy restaurant.\nBodean\u2019s American Diner\nwith a branch in Fulham Broadway is another local that does\nbarbeque, but in an oak-burn-ing smoke-pit rather than over\ncharcoal. Their slow-cooked\ngoodies include ribs, chicken\nwings, pulled pork and beef\nbrisket burnt ends. Be prepared for some unsophisticated hands-on meat-eating\nwith sticky barbeque sauce\neverywhere. My recommendation is the shared platter for\ntwo, which lets you sample\neverything they have in the\nsmoke-pit. The free \u201cQ-card\u201d\nmembership card entitles you\nto some decent offers such as\na complimentary dessert, like\na big wedge of gooey American\npecan tart, or schnapps.\nBest Mangal: 104 North End Rd\nBodean\u2019s BBQ: Fulham\nBroadway\n\n"

She said\nthat she was \u201cexcited to be sharing an\noffice with Michael Foster,\u201d who was\nelected as Deputy President (Finance &\nServices). Jason Parmar narrowly beat\nStefan Bauer to become Deputy President (Education). Nicolas Massie was\nelected as Deputy President (Welfare)\nand Matt Colvin as Felix Editor. Felix\nEditor was the most closely contended\nposition with Colvin beating Alexander\nKarapetian by only 68 votes.\nNathaniel Bottrell, Eugene Chang,\nRavi Pall and Abdul Patel were elected\nto roles of student trustees, who sit on\nthe Union\u2019s Trustee Board, its governing\nbody, without taking a year out.

These\nresults are the final tally of votes\nafter 2nd and 3rd preferences are\nincluded.\nMiles Robertson\nMaciej Matuszewski\nRecord turnout as Union\ninnovates with live voting stats\nImperial College Union had one of the\nhighest election turnouts, so far this\nyear, of any UK university, with 32.5%\nof students voting. A record 5,033 out\nof 26,809 students participated, which\nis an increase of 50% from last year\u2019s\n3,387 voters. For the first time ever, the\nUnion showed live voting stats on their\nwebsites throughout the voting period,\nallowing students to see turnout for different departments and halls.\nThe Faculty of Natural Sciences had\nthe largest turnout with 41% of students\nvoting. The engineers came in second\nwith 35.3% and the Medics came third\nwith 23.5%.\nEvery hall of residence voted and had\nat least a 10% increase on the number\nof people voting. Additionally, Medicine undergraduates saw the largest\nincreased turnout compared to their\nprevious year.\nFor the second consecutive year, the\nLife Sciences department has had the\nhighest voting turnout. Materials students went from the lowest voting recorded last year straight up to the highest\nturnout for this year for the Engineering\ndepartment. Although most other universities are still in the election process,\nthe participation from other student\nunions that have completed their elections has not matched up to Imperial.\nEven though Southampton had a staggering 7,285 voters from a student body\nof 23,000 students this was 30% of their\neligible students. Kings College Union\nhad a record number of voters \u2013 4,024,\nwhich only made up 18% of their stu-dents. Only 12.14% of University College London students voted in their\nelections, giving a total of 2996 voters.\nEdinburgh had 22% of their students\nvoting and Sheffield had 24%.\nTherefore in terms of percentage of\nstudents that participated in the student\nelections, with 32.5% of the student\nbody voting, Imperial currently holds\nthe top position in the UK.\nAemun Reza\nFrom left: Monya Zard (Clubs & Societies), Jason Parmar (Education), Scott Heath (President), Michael Foster (Finance & Services), Matt Colvin (Felix Editor) and Nicolas Massie (Welfare)\n\n"

    "content": "FEATURES\nFELIX\nFriday 18 march 2011\n8\nSuzie Rayner is running\nuncontested for Medic\nPresident, but is she\nthe right person for the\nposition?\nThis is your second time running. What do\nyou think that says about you?\nI think it probably shows how much I want the\nposition. Obviously I\u2019ve had to rethink it this\nyear and it\u2019s quite a weird experience running\nfor it for the second time, but it\u2019s also quite\nexciting.\nYou\u2019re unopposed, would you rather have\nhad somebody running against you?\nIt would be great to win when you\u2019re way into\nit, but last year it was very close and very stress-ful, and I feel that I proved myself last year. So\nI\u2019m not worried about being the only choice\nstudents have, because I think I had enough\nsupport last year to prove that I\u2019m ready.\nDo you think there\u2019s a lack of choice in the\nsense that there isn\u2019t someone else offering\na different set of policies?\nI suppose so, but I think you have to rely on\nthe fact that I will pick up ideas from some\nother members. And there\u2019s so much competition this year for some of the positions that it\u2019s\nbeen great listening to it. I\u2019ve been scribbling\ndown ideas either thinking how similar they\nare to mine, or how good other ideas are that I\nwant to borrow.\nWhat would be your focus next year?\nOne of the two main areas I\u2019ve always thought\nwas essential to a President\u2019s role is maintenance of what has come before. This tends\nto be forgotten when people come in all guns\nblazing talking about the things they\u2019re going\nto change. The other area a lot of the academic\nreps are talking about is the feedback from\nfaculty to student. We have an excellent system of feedback from student to faculty, but\nit always gets stuck halfway back. We want to\nmake the system easier to access, like by putting it on the website.\nSo, to use the old phrase, \u2018if it ain\u2019t broke,\ndon\u2019t fix it\u2019. What things are in your opinion\nnot broken, and so don\u2019t need to be fixed?\nWelfare, for instance, has come along amazingly these past few years, but the obvious\nproblem with the welfare system is that new\nproblems arise all the time, so it\u2019s working off\nthe solid base we\u2019ve got now.\nAfter the controversy with the Daily Mail\narticle, do you think there\u2019s anything that\nstill needs to be addressed on that front?\nI think the main things that came out of that\nwere issues about the Reynolds, and areas\nwhere we weren\u2019t fulfilling our responsibili-ties. Those need to be worked on gradually,\nand some of the dramatic changes we\u2019ve made\nrecently have caused massive uproar but have\nbeen effective.\nWere, say, the sports teams a bit upset\nabout these changes?\nI think they were more concerned about\nwhat could happen, and the threats that they\nwouldn\u2019t be allowed to stay in the Reynolds.\nBut clearly they have, and so the changes\nwe\u2019ve implemented are not so disastrous.\nDo you think Medic \u2018antics\u2019 are given too\nmuch attention?\nI think the reason their antics get overhyped\nis that, like with the Daily Mail issue, we see\nheadlines saying \u201cThis person will be your\ndoctor\u201d while we see them behaving like any\nother student, to be honest. So yes, I think it\ndoes get overblown. Having two different bars\ndoes also add to the air of mystery about the\nmedics\u2019 behaviour.\nIs there a sense that medical students who\ndon\u2019t drink feel excluded from their Union?\nIt seems to me that because people go on\nabout catering for \u2018drinkers\u2019 or \u2018non-drinkers\u2019, they\u2019re escalating a divide that probably\nwasn\u2019t there to begin with. Obviously there\nare people who will never want to go to the\nReynolds, and those are the people we need to\nmake sure we\u2019re catering for. There\u2019s less of a\nproblem with drinkers and non-drinkers than\nthere is with people not being interested in the\nsame events.\nHow big do you feel the divide between\nMedics and the rest of Imperial is?\nI have a couple of non-medical friends from\nHalls, but other than that most of my friends\nfrom halls were also medical students. The\ndivide ultimately comes down to the degree\nbeing 6 years instead of 3 or 4, and the different locations medical students have to go\nto over their time here. It\u2019s not necessarily a\ngood thing, but there are clear reasons for it.\nIt is, however, a shame to have rivalry in the\nwrong places. So at Varsity, for instance, rivalry is brilliant. But when it\u2019s people saying\n\u201cOh, I hate medics\u201d or the other way around,\nthat\u2019s clearly not healthy.\nDoes this divide need to be closed, or are\nyou happy with the current state of affairs?\nUltimately, it does need to be people\u2019s choice.\nEveryone should be made aware of the clubs\nor activities available in the main student\nUnion, so that it starts being seen as accept-able; a friendly approach from both sides is\nessential. However, I don\u2019t think the best way\nis to try to force people to integrate.\nYou\u2019re a fourth year now, so where did your\njourney to this point begin?\nI remember that I spoke with the current President, Dave Smith, on day three of university,\nand he said \u201cI want to be president\u2019. I never\nhad that. I just couldn\u2019t imagine why a person would want to take year out at any point.\nSo I suppose that a lot has changed. Probably\none of the big things that I\u2019ve done personally\nand for the Medics Union is my work as RAG\nChair in second year. That\u2019s one of the biggest\nreasons why I realised that I could do the job\nof President.\nIf you love your subject, and you really want\nto be a doctor, why would you take a year off\nand push back becoming a doctor by a year?\nThat was always the reason that I hesitated\nabout it. I love medicine and that\u2019s one of the\nbiggest cons to running for President. However,\nthe skills that I\u2019ll learn and the importance of\nthe role to the Medical school are most impor-tant. I love medicine but I also love the medical school as much, if not more. I believe that I\nhave the traits to do the job well, but we\u2019ll see\nobviously. I know that I would do it well.\nWhat are those traits?\nI know that if someone came to an open day\nand met me, I\u2019m pretty sure that they wouldn\u2019t\nforget me. That sounds really arrogant I know,\nbut what I mean is that I feel that I could give\npeople a good impression of the medical\nschool and get them enthusiastic about it.\nThe Medics\u2019 Union is facing large cuts over\nthe next 5 years. How big a deal is this?\nThis is a big deal, we\u2019re hoping that the cut\nwill be much smaller than what they\u2019re threatening at the moment. The area that we hope to\nmove to in getting funding from is the ICSM\nalumni. It\u2019s building every year.\nWhat can you do to fight these cuts?\nI\u2019m very pro student opinion but I also know\nthat if you go into meetings saying \u201cwe want\nthis, we want that\u201d that you\u2019re not going to get\nanywhere. I will compromise on certain things,\nto get the more important things. However,\nwhat\u2019s essential is that we continue to persuade\npeople of the importance of the Union\u2019s role.\nMiles Robertson\nTHE NEXT MEDIC\nPRESIDENT?\nInterview by\nKadhim Shubber\nFeatures Editor: Lizzie Crouch\nfelix@imperial.ac.uk\n\n"

Living alone\nlets you get more work done\nand avoids the issue of finding that your friends are less\nenjoyable when you live with\nthem. The main cons are the\nincreased cost (you have to\npay your bills all by yourself)\nand the solitude. However, if\nyou\u2019re a person who values\ntheir space, the solitude could\nbe a plus! Don\u2019t rule out living\nalone as an option.\nT\nhere are few general\nrules about this as\nevery person you\ncan live with will be\ndifferent. That said,\nif you have any doubts about\nany of your prospective flat-mates it\u2019s best to get it all out\nin the open before you become\na legally combined entity on\na tenancy contract. The most\ncommon type of contract allows your flatmates to leave\nand burden the rest of you with\nthe shortfall in rent so don\u2019t be\ncomplacent about working on\npersonal relationships in your\nhouse.\nLiving Arrangements\nLiving alone\nThe general rule is that if you\nlive with loads of people and\ndon\u2019t think that any of them\nis a complete disgusting slob,\nit\u2019s probably you. If you are worried that this is this case, then\nliving in a house with only one\nother person is the best way to\ngo. Mostly because it is easy\nto distinguish whose mess is\nwhose, and it is harder to hide\nbehind the excuse that it\u2019s\nsomeone else\u2019s turn to tidy up.\nDon\u2019t ignore the fact that your\nuntidiness can have a real impact on your friendships, even\nwith your closest friends, so do\nmake an effort. Cleaning rotas\ncan be helpful to make sure\neveryone does their fair share.\nDealing with messy housemates\nHave you got a two-bed flat?\nAnd a flatmate who\u2019s like,\ntotally in love with this girl?\nWhat are you going to do when\nhe asks you one day whether\nit\u2019s cool if she moves in with\nhim. Are you happy with that?\nAshton, a final year Materials\nstudent who said yes tells Felix, \u201cI knew both of them well\nbefore they were going out,\u201d.\nHe stresses that, as with all\nhousing situations, it depends\nupon their personalities. Occasionally arguments happen\n(as with anyone), but that\n\u201chappens even if you don\u2019t\nlive with a couple, and they\u2019re\nprobably being even more\ncareful about how much I\u2019m\ninvolved.\u201d He went on to say\nthat it was, \u201cprobably the best\nliving arrangement [he\u2019d] had\nat university.\u201d\nWhat is it like living with a couple?\nThe sure fire way to save on\nrent is to share a one bed flat\nwith someone you love, or hell,\nif you\u2019re free and easy, share a\none bed flat with several people you love (Felix doesn\u2019t recommend this). This can also\nbe very good for your relation-ship; it will either bring you incredibly close together or very\nquickly let you know that it\u2019s\nnot meant to be. However it\u2019s\nimportant to remember that\nfinding out your true feelings\nfor your better half and complying with a legal obligation\nto pay rent for a set period\nof time can conflict with each\nother if things go south in a\nbad way. Fernanda, an Imperial student who found herself\nin this situation warned, \u201cWe\nmoved in and started making less of an effort to see\neach other, and then the arguments started and we would\nsay things we didn\u2019t mean\nbut couldn\u2019t take back.\u201d Still\nthough she doesn\u2019t want to\nput anyone thinking about it:\n\u201cI still think it was good, and\nit was especially useful in the\nlong run.\u201d There are many success stories as well, Kat. a\npostgrad in Nat Sci who has\nbeen living with her boyfriend\nsince they met in Beit says\n\u201cwe realised we would live well\ntogether in halls in first year\nand have been living together\never since.

Doctor!\nFix my teddy bear!\nOxford University formally\nsignals rise to \u00a39,000 fees\nStudents host Teddy Bear Hospital\nOn Wednesday 2nd March, the Imperial branch of the European Medical\nStudents Assosciation (EMSA) held\ntheir annual Teddy Bear Hospital (TBH)\nEvent at Chelsea and Westminster Hospital. This year, they invited children\nfrom St Luke\u2019s CE Primary School\nand St Stephen\u2019s Primary School. Over\nthe course of the day, 100 hyperactive\nschool children aged 5-7 were let loose\non the TBH manned by over 60 medical\nstudents from Years 2-6.\nTBH is a place where children can\nbring their sick teddies to get better.\nThrough \u201cmake-believe\u201d, Teddy Bear\nHospital aims to help alleviate the common childhood fear of hospitals.\nSimply put: the Teddies are the pa-tients, the children are the parents and the\nmedical students play Teddy Doctors.\nChildren were taken on a journey\nthrough the healthcare pathway via ten\ndifferent stations, some of which focused on experiences and others on edu-cation.\nThe children started off by filling out\n\u2018Patient Notes\u2019 detailing Teddy\u2019s ailments before dialing \u2018999\u2019 and having\nTeddy whisked away on a stretcher to\nthe \u2018Teddy Ambulance\u2019.\nLater on, it all got messy at the plastering station where each child was given\nthe opportunity to plaster their little finger and decorate it with their own artistic flair.\nOne of the most popular stations every\nyear is Teddy Surgery. Children dress\nup as mini-surgeons ready to fix Teddy.\nAfter sending Teddy to Dreamland they\ntake Teddy apart, find out what\u2019s wrong\nwith him and put him back together\nagain.\nEducation was made fun with odd\ncombinations of fruits selected by the\nchildren blended together to make surprisingly delicious smoothies at the\nHealthy Living Station. Meanwhile,\nat the exercise station, everyone had a\nwork out by playing \u2018Simon Says\u2019 and\n\u2018Punch Balloon\u2019. The students seemed\nmore worn out than the children by the\nend of it!\nThe kids got ready for their close-ups\non camera at the diary room station.\nThey then relaxed at comfy beanbag sta-tion, whilst reflecting on the day.\nThe day was a great success with positive feedback from not only the kids and\nthe medical students but also the staff\nand parents. The EMSA would like to\nthank everyone who helped and hope to\nsee new faces in the future.\nVideos and photos of the day will be\nup on the new TBH website soon, so be\nsure to check it out: http://www.icsmsu.\ncom/tbh/\nIrum Sunderji\nPriyanga Vijayakumar\nSup fool?\n\u201cWho wants me to poke out its eyes?\u201d\nThe University of Oxford has become\nthe fourth institution in the country to\nofficially announce a rise of tuition fees\nto the maximum figure of \u00a39,000.\nFollowing in the footsteps of Imperial,\nCambridge and, most recently, Exeter,\nOxford\u2019s move to increase the fees for\nhome and EU students has been anticipated since the beginning of February,\nfollowing a debate held by students and\nsenior university figures. The university\nunveiled its proposals earlier this week,\nconfirming the proposed tuition charge\nfor a year of undergraduate study to be\n\u00a39,000. Alongside this, the university\nrevealed its plans for making financial\nhelp readily available to English students from less privileged backgrounds.\nStudents joining the university from\nhouseholds with an income of less than\n\u00a316,000 will be required to pay a sub-sidised figure of \u00a33,500 for their first\nyear of study, with this amount rising to\n\u00a36,000 for the following years.\nThose from a household income of\nless than \u00a325,000 will receive a reduction in the tuition fees, with students\nfrom a household earning more than this\nbeing required to pay the full \u00a39,000.\nHowever, those from a household income of less than \u00a342,600 will receive\na means-tested bursary. It is expected\nthat approximately 10% of students will\nreceive the highest available bursary\nof \u00a34,300 in their first year, falling to\n\u00a33,300 thereafter.\nFee reduction and bursary support\nfor students from the rest of the United\nKingdom and European Economic Area\ncountries is listed on the university\u2019s\nwebsite as \u2018still being reviewed\u2019.\nOxford\u2019s proposals are subject to approval by the Office for Fair Access\n(OFFA), with this caveat also applying to the other universities wishing to\ncharge more than \u00a36,000. Confirmation\nis expected by the end of July.\nProfessor Andrew Hamilton, ViceChancellor of the university, wrote an\nonline statement in response to the pro-posals, stating, \u201cIt is deeply regrettable,\nas the University has made clear, that\nthe Government is reducing drastically\ndirect public investment in university\nteaching.\u201d\n\u201cExcellence is not cheap and the\nfunding gap is wide. This means that in\nreaching difficult judgements about how\nto deal with immediate challenges, Oxford also has to be attentive to longer-term ones.\u201d\nMatt Colvin\nPaddington Charitable Trust. The charity has become increasingly oriented towards supporting the patients and staff of\nImperial College Healthcare NHS Trust.\nIn other words, they are prioritising patient care. ICSMSU intends to appeal\nagainst the decision, fearing that the reduced funding will not be enough to sustain vital aspects of the union.\nICSMSU has traditionally received\n\u00a340,000 a year from the Hammersmith\nCharitable Trust. This was received for\n2009-10 immediately following the charity\u2019s transformation but the union was\nwarned that this wouldn\u2019t last. ICSMSU\nhave been awarded \u00a340,000 for 2010-11 and grants for the next four financial\nyears decreasing by 20% each year.\nAllocation of the \u00a340,000 is \u00a38,000\nfor equipment purchase, \u00a34,000 for\nICSM Gazette (which produces 3 issues\nper year), \u00a310,000 for elective awards,\nand \u00a318,000 towards the ICSMSU President\u2019s (\u00a324,000) salary.\nElectives, during which final year students embark on medical placements\nabroad, can often be a financial challenge and this hardship fund is a highly\nsought after resource. If the cuts do go\nahead, it is likely that ICSM Gazette\u2019s\nfunding will be completely cut.\nThe hope in the long-term is to move\ntowards acquiring funding from the\nICSM Alumni Association. Of course,\nencouraging donations from alumni is a\nchallenge, but support appears to have\nbeen building year on year. Suzanne\nRayner believes that in order to maintain the provision of funds, people need\nto be persuaded of the importance of the\nunion\u2019s role.\nThe use of charitable funds in healthcare is a well-established tradition; most\nof the hospitals within Imperial College\nHealthcare NHS Trust were founded by\nindependent charities as voluntary hospitals pre-20th century. The idea behind\nthese hospitals was to provide for sick\nworking-class citizens, the \u201cdeserving\npoor\u201d. Despite the shift to government\nfunding for health, with the establishment of the NHS in 1948, hospital charities have persisted; Imperial College\nHealthcare Charity is a descendent of\nthe charities which founded the hospitals constituting the Trust.\nThe Union are looking to increase alumni funding in the long-term\nMiles Robertson\n...Continued from Front Page\n\n"
