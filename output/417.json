    "content": "itF ltl X NSDF EDINBURGH\nThe 21st National Student Drama Festival\nFRIDAY \u2014 THE FLYING SCOTSMAN does\ndie 375 miles to Edinburgh in just over\nfive hours \u2014 amazing. As we cross the\nborder the hills are suddenly covered\nwith snow. At Waverley station the\ntemperature is1* C compared with the\nbalmy 14CC of Kings Cross. Although no\nmore snow falls, the slush is slow to\nclear from the pavements.\nThe usual chaos at the Festival Centre; \" Are you from the BBC? We've\nchanged your accommodation. How much\nmoney do you owe us?\" Charles Manowitz's Palach opens the\nproceedings. We all s it within a circle, whilst the action takes place around us on four raised platforms, often simultaneously. The message is in the form,\nthat whatever personal sacrifices a man\nmay make to express a want for freedom,\nsociety is so confused by the continuous\nbombast from the media that his single\nsmall voice is lost in a sea of advertising\nslogans. Do you remember Jan Pala ch' s self-immolation in Wenceleslas Square,\nPrague, in 1968? To some extent it is the\nconditioning that we receive from newspapers and television to the news that\nthey present that dulls the sharp edges\nof our memory.\nSATURDAY After last night's Marowitz play, the man himself. He seems to set himself up as the establish ment figure of experimental theatre,\nattacking everything in sight. \"What a spectacular lack of imagination the\nNational Theatre has. Why is so much\ntheatre centralised in London? How much the Arts Council Drama Panel is in a state of jobs for the boys and\ndoling out e not mou s sums of money to\nlarge charismatic organisations like the\nRSC and NT.\" At last the students get\ntheir teeth into him:\" Why is your Open\nSpace Theatre in central London, Mr\nMaro witz?\"\" Because l need the criticism and the atmosphere that being in London\ngives me\"! A ten minute walk down the Royal\nMile brings us to the cosy Netherbow\nTheatre, where the Central School of\nArt and Design have got together what I can only describe as a piece of performed\ndesign. Twelve students have each\nvisited a different town in England and\ndistilled his or her impressions of it into\na five minute performance. What are our\nreactions supposed to be? Should we\nend up by having some idea of what\ndistinguishes one town from another.\nSwindon is depicted with foam rubber\nrailway tracks and usherettes come\nround the auditorium dispensing tea. At Grimsby they are painting a Russian ship and maintaining the street lamps.\nSUNDAY A talk from JW Lambert,\nLiterary and Arts editor of the Sunday\nTimes, by whose grace the festival has been brought to- the age of majority, and\ncontinues to survive. He gives us a good look at the role of the critic in the\ntheatre and the method by which he works. One of the aims of the Festival is to\nbring the work of student playwrights to\nthe forefront.-Frank Oates is a45 year\nDetail from a scene in \"GAS\" by Georg Kaiser performed by Leeds University.\nold Open University student. He is also\na prisoner in Wakefield gaol and has used his experiences, however remote,\nto write a play set in a South African prison. Apart from the prisoner under\nsentence of death it is a pall ingly acted.\nAn acrimonious discussion ensues\nbetween those who are enchanted and\nthose who are amazed that such work has\nbeen selected for the Festival. The selectors patiently explain for the\numpteenth time that, of course they are\nfallible, but you should have seen the\namount of rubbish they had to s it through.\nWe all spill into the Royal Lyceum for a professional performance \u2014 Yobbo\nNowt by John McGrath \u2014 by the 7.84\nTheatre Company (England). Their name\ncomes from the reported fact that 7% of\nthe population own 84% of the wealth.\nTheir work is designed for the 93.16\nmajority; they set out to use the theatre\nto educate the working man politically with a great deal of fun thrown in. It is difficult to judge how it would go down\nwith its intended audience but the\nstudents certainly enjoy the vitality\nwhich has been missing from the\nFestival so far.\nMONDAY The Strathclyde Theatre\nGroup has come across from Glasgow\nwith four productions; three of which\nwe see this afternoon. Of particular\ninterest is[ slot I, a monologue for a disembodied mouth by Samuel Beckett.\nIt is a curiously compelling performance\nof a rarely seen work, though much is in\nthe writing.\nCoup d 'Etat, from Keele, is another\nstudent written production. An urban\nguerilla comes to dinner in order to\ncommit suicide under the noses of his media-orientated hosts. Gordon Honeycombe complains that the re vol unti on ary' s black polo-neck uniform is exactly what\nhe himself is wearing. There is a fascinating study of the cultivated city\ngent putting forward his right wing views and getting slowly drunk. Minor details\nin the production worry me; why are\nthey drinking vintage claret with\nbouillabaisse and without decanting it? Especially as the city gent is teased\nfor his knowledge of fine food and wine!\nThe Scots have a curious custom of\nclosing the bars at 10pm, effectively\nreducing the social life of the festival. TUESDAY A fascinating day's work\nwith Mike Leigh, a director who uses\nimprovisation to create drama. His talk\nin- the morning serves only to whet the\nappetite for the afternoon's practical\nsession. What we can learn in an afternoon is severely limited (he\ngenerally takes eight weeks to produce\na play) but, in small groups, we create\ncharacters based on people we already\nknow and put them into situations where\nwe hope themes will develop and a story will build up.\n\n"

    "content": "mix ti NSDF EDINBURGH\nLeonardo's Last Supper is aRaba la is ian romp in the char nel house at\nAmboise, where Leonardo da Vinci' s body has been brought. The glee of\nthe owner's family over the fame their\nwork will bring them soon turns to despair\nwhen it turns out that the master is not\ndead after all, however they quickly restore the status quo. The actors put a lot of spirit into the production and\ncarry the audience with them on a sea of enthusiasm.\nMany students, it seems, cannot\nsurvive more than ten minutes without a cigarette. The audience is distracted\nby the flare of matches and the unpleasant atmosphere created in a situation where the non-smokers are\nstuck in their seats.\nWEDNESDAY The inhabitants of\nEdinburgh seem to possess a strong fear\nof crossing roads, perhaps motivated by\nthe apparent disorder in the traffic flow.\nCars and lorries come at me from all directions.\nA new play from St. Andrews \u2014 Jacek Lask ow ski's Galatea \u2014 or as the\nScotsman apparently misprinted it\nGala Tea! The widow receives a visit from her brother-in-law and goes into a neurotic monologue which is as much a trial for the audience as it must be for\nthe actress. The play leaves a lot of\nconfusion in its wake. I am worried\nthat the same record is played twice in\nthe play and once it contains guitar\nmusic, the second time the Brahms\nviolin concerto; it is these apparently\ninsignificant details that distract the\naudience from absorbing the whole. In\nthe formal discussion after the play\nvarious conventions have to be explained\nby the author/director/leading man; it\nleaves me wondering what he will do\nwhen there is no formal discussion after his plays. THURSDAY Martin E ssl in, head of BBC radio and chairman of the Arts\nCouncil Drama Panel talks on today's theatre. The British Theatre has a great\nlead over theatre in other countries\nbecause of the basis of tradition and\nthe clash between the sub sidi sed and\ncommercial sectors. There is a discussion of the political power of theatre in Europe. It is theatre, more than any other\nmedium, which can provide images and\nmake points that will be remembered for\na long time.\nTo the Traverse Theatre to see a new\nplay by Robert Pugh with his group from\nRose Bruford College of Speech and\nDrama. The Key is a remarkable play\nwith a tremendous force. Three Irishmen\ndig up their hanged brother to recover a key. The programme says that the play\ntakes place in County Clare, but the\nappearance of English soldiers sets up\nan uncontrollable resonance and confusion in my mind. In the final scene\nthe brothers perch the corpse on a chair behind the altar. After the soldiers\nhave taken away the ringleader, the\nidiot brother, who has hidden under the\naltar to escape detection, rises from his\nplace of concealment as the priest mutters\nhis prayers. What a tremendous theatrical\nmoment when the priest turns to see the\ncorpse apparently come to life!\nFRIDAY \u2014 An end of term spirit prevails. We discuss the next festival and there\nis what turns out to be a prize giving\nceremony, with mysterious envelopes\nhanded to the winners.\nWhat has the Festival achieved? As a showcase for the display of student\nwritten and student-performed theatre\nit has worked. There has been ample\ntime for discussion and professional\nopinions have been freely available. At times the discussions have been in severe danger of drowning in a sea of\nintellectual argument. What it all boils down to is what goes on on the stage\nand each member of the audience's response to that experience.\nA series of familiar names have\nappeared and talked and discussed the\ntheatre but everyone has been very\npolite to each other. There has certainly been too much talk of theatre as an intellectual exercise and not enough\non the practice of theatre.\nMy regrets are twofold; Firstly that I missed Leeds University' s much\nacclaimed performance of Gas, a German\nexpressionist piece of around 1920; and\nsecondly that I had to return to London without seeing John Hurt, the well-known\nactor, who was scheduled to talk on\nSaturday.\nOne of the inherent factors of a crowded\nfestival programme is that items are met\nor missed suddenly and without preparation\nLiterally at the last minute I decided to\nrun across to the other side of Edinburgh\nfor a final chance to see a piece of\nGerman Expressionistic drama from the\n1 9 2 0 s Georg Kaiser' s' Gas'. This bit of\n'impulse buying' turned up a rare and\nfascinating purchase. German Expressionism is never seen on modern stages\nbecause of its scale, its unrelenting\nverbal attack and sheer lack of objective\ninsight into character ,but Leeds University should be congratulated for\ntaking these challenging problems and\ngiving as authentic a production as possible. The play, in its time, was a. prophecy\nof the doom which would result when a world was destroyed by the exploding of\nits entire energy resources - the gas of\nthe title. It is a prophecy which rings\ntrue. The first hour of the play deals\nwith the aftermath of the explosion and\nthe confrontation of the two central characters, the millionaire's son and the\nengineer-the former owns all the industry\nana determines that he will not rebuild\nit but replace it with a garden city fa modern-day conservationist and en v iron mentalist) while the engineer argues\nthat we must put up with occasional from future gaa explosions in order to\ncontinue the technological advance of\ncivilisation.( Surely a vitally relevant\nquestion for a college such as ours.)\nFor the second half of the play, we\nwere led out of the small TRAVERSE Theatre, along the drunks' quarter of\nEdinbugh, at about 10 pm, past decaying\ntenement blocks and under Piran es ian archways to a nearby hall where the\nWorkers' Riot, led by the engineer, was\nacted out, while the audience was forced\nto stand for another hour.\nThe combined effect of aural and\nvisual assault from words; white noise; strobe lights; harsh, evocative, futuristic\nsets and costumes, not to men to in the\nlate night walk, all summed to produce\nan overpowering effect and a theatrical\nexperience Is nail remember for a long\ntime.\nReports by Thomas Stevenson\nand Eric Stovell.\nPictures courtesy of\n'The Sunday Times'.\nBelow, a scene from \"The Key\" performed by Rose Bruford College of\nSpeech and Drama.\n\n"

    "content": "MU X Theatre\nThe Lyttelton Theatre\nIF THERE were one event that could\nprevent me from beginning my review with\na paean for Ralph Richardson, Wendy -Hi I ler\nand Peggy Ashcroft in Ibsen's John\nGabrield Borkmann, it could only be the\nopening of the new National Theatre\nbuildings on the South Bank, east of\nWaterloo bridge.\nIt is now 128 years since the wrangling\nover the setting up of a theatre for the\nnation began. Among the sites which have,\nover the years, been earmarked for a National company is that plot opposite the\nVictoria and Albert Museum now occupied\nby a well-known car hire company.\nThe new building is magnificent -almost overwhelmingly so, since it nearly\ntakes over as the focus of attention from\nthe prime target of the play and its per-form ance. I hope that this is only a transient effect, for, although this is one\nof the very few new theatre buildings to\nopen in Europe in recent years and presents\na radical new concept in theatre going to\nthe public, the actors should really be the\ncentral attraction.\nThe National Theatre has always\nprovided concessions to students in the\nform of cheaper seats for those willing to\nqueue early on the day of the performance,\nbut its new policy of seat booking in the\nLyttelton requires that you arrive early at\nthe theatre to stake your claim to a particular numbered seat. Apart from the\n10X3 \u00a31 seats (half to be sold in advance\nTerraced in!\nand half on the day of the performance from\n8.30 am) all seats cost \u00a32.35, which pays\nfor admission to the auditorium. A premium\nof \u00a32 will secure the seat of your choice, the remaining seats are distributed to\nthose with \u00a32.35 tickets, not more than\ntwo hours before curtain-up. However there\nis plenty to do and see if you arrive\nearly.\nThere are two buffets, a restaurant and\nseveral bars, which are all open in the\ndaytime as appropriate. The cramped\nbooks tall of the Old Vic days has become\nmore spacious and there are, at present,\ntwo exhibitions of theatrical objects. On\nmost evenings there are events beginning\naround 6.15. These take the form of readings\nor concerts in the spacious foyers or in a special room set aside for the purpose.\nWhen the National Theatre project was being tossed around by committees there\nwas a general consensus that one auditorium would not be enough. You cannot\nhave an auditorium versatile enough to\nhold Shakespeare \u2014 ideally on a thrust\nstage \u2014 and more modern plays written,for\nthe proscenium arch. So this building holds\nthree stages.Only the Lyttelton (proscenium)\nis open so far - one of Peter Hall's great\nsuccesses in that, in his own words, \" He got his foot in the door\" the Olivier( thrust) is hopefully to open early in July, with the Cottesloe (a small studio) coming\nlater. The Grand Official Opening by the\nQueen comes later still; but for the time\nbeing the building is at last living.\nThe architect, Denys Las dun, has\ndone the nation proud, using shuttered\nconcrete to enforce a strong vertical line\ninside the foyers, with numerous levels\nand balconies, from which to observing\nthe arriving audiences and the special\nevents. Perhaps he has failed in respect\nthat the Thames is almost invisible from\nwithin the building for, although the\nwindows are there in profusion, multi-level terracing, which will clearly be well\noccupied on warm summer evenings,\nobscures any views across to Somerset\nHouse. The Lyttelton seems to justify the new\nticket scheme since all the seats appear\nto have an equal advantage. There is no\nfeeling, at the back of the stalls, of being\ntucked in under the circle, and there are\na few long rows instead of the usual\ntunnel in which the stage seems a million\nmiles from the back rows. In fact the\nLyttelton seats twelve more than the Old Vic, in a great deal more intimacy.\nJohn Gabriel Borkmann is one of six plays transferred to Lyttelton for an\nintroductory season. I didn't see it at the\nOld Vic but the larger Lyttelton stage\nseems to make more of the claustrophobic\ninteriors with large dark voids on either\nside. Sir Ralph and Daine Wendy, with\ntheir idiosyncratic fidgeting in particular\nfilled the theatre with their distress. A splendid performance in a splendid new\ntheatre.\nThomas Stevenson\nMusic\nDavid Bowie - Station to Station ( RCA) Excellent\nTHAT MAN Bowie does it again. Not\ncontent with exercising his superstar talents in the film genre, he has\naugmented his already excellent catalogue\nof albums with yet another vinyl\nmasterpiece.\nHe departs from his usual\nmusical trend and produces music that is\nnot easily cat agori sed. However, this\ndoes not in anyway detract from it. On\nthe contrary, cat ago rising is made\ndifficult by the individuality expressed\nin the music.\nThe album features the hit single\n\"Golden Years\" - a far superior version\nof which is on the album. In fact, there\nisn'ta single dud track on the whole\nalbum but one must single out \"Word on\nWing\" and \"Stay\" as absolute Bowie\nclassics of the future.\nThe former combines the remarkable\nvoice of Bowie, the neat and tight\ndrumming of Dennis Davis and the piano\nplaying of Roy Bittan to excellent effect.\nThe latter is surely one of the best\npieces of contemporary funky-rock music\nI have heard for some time.\nI have always been somewhat reserved\nas regards Bowie' s music, but without\nhesitation, I can heartily recommend\nthis album to you. Harry Nilsson - Sandman-(nCA)\nAN ENIGMA OF MEDIOCRITY This album is a complete enigma as\nfar as I am concerned. It is neither of\nanything and when the first line of the\nlyrics to the first track on side one is\n\"Deep down in my soul I hate rock and\nroll\" then a feeling of utter contempt\nbegins to creep in for the whole album.\nAs my dear friend Lorna pointed out,\n\"It doesn't have \"Without You\" on it\" and I would agree with her in so far as there is no tune on this vinyl which is\nof the calibre of that song.\nThe only remotely decent song on the\nwhole album is \"Pretty soon there'll be\nnothing left for everybody\". The way\nthings are going at the moment I'd agree.\nI must, however, not finish without\nmentioning \"The Flying Saucer Song\". A really amusing song about two drunks\nhaving a conversation in a bar \u2014 the\nsort of conversation that every drunk\ndreams of having. It is beautifully put to\nmusic with a great deal of effect. I can\nimagine people buying the album just for\nthis song. A word of warning, however;\nbeware of ending up as crab dinner the\nsame way Nils on seems to have done!\nPaul Ekpenyong\nCinema\nThe Slipper And The Rose by Bryan'\nForbes: starring Richard Chamberlain,\nGemma Craven, Anette Crosbie etc.\nTHERE ARE only two things wrong with\nthis film in my view and these are that\nit is produced by David Frost and the\nsongs are written by the Sherman brothers.\nHowever, once I'd got over these two\nun savoury facts, the film became, for me\na thoroughly entertaining one.\nIt overflows with the British stars,\nsome of whom go in for this type of film\nand some who don't. Richard Chamberlain\nmanages to hide his discomfort and\nstruggle through, but the honours must go\nto Annette Cro s bie as the Fairy Godmother.\nShe plays the typically charming but\nresigned mother always coming to the\nrescue with a sigh.T his together with\nher insistence to look ordinary is in\nmarked contrast to one's idea of a Fairy godmother.\nKenneth Moore as the Chamberlain\nand Julian Orchard as Montague, the\nPrince's cousin, are definitely the\nbiggest pair of jokers in the film except\npossibly for the Dowager Queen (Edith\nEvans) whose interjections are a humorous treat.\nThe film is overplayed in parts as in\nthe scene in the King's Court but\notherwise moves at a fairly brisk pace\nwith romance and disaster coming through\ntit for tat.\n\n"

    "content": "Bucharest delegation censured\nCHARLES CLARKE, Alastair Stewart\nand Trevor Phillips came in for heavy\ncriticism over their conduct at the 13th European meeting of national unions of\nstudents held in Bucharest last December.\nThe conference felt that all three had\nacted inappropriately by not adequately\nrepresenting NUS policy on topics\ndiscussed at the meeting.\nDelegates were also displeased\nwith the signing of the final communique\nissued at the end of the meeting. It was\nfelt that the delegation had followed to\nmuch of a pro-Soviet line during the\nmeeting.\nCharles Clarke (top) and Chris Morgan\nAll three were censured and the\nreport of the meeting which included the\noffending communique rejected by the\nconference. Charles Clarke was also\ncensured for not making available, before\nthe conference began, the text of the\ncommunique as he had promised at the\nUniversities Policy Conference. The\nmotion of censure on Mr Clarke was\nmoved by Mr Peter Teague, ICU\nPresident.\nThe section of the communique which\nangered delegates most dealt with\nwomen. The communique stresses\n\"that due to continuance of a capitalist\norder in many European countries,\nwomen remained totally oppressed and\nwere denied equal rights in education\nand many other fields of endeavour.\"\n\u2022 \"Inadequate sex education, contraception and abortion facilities means\nthat much hardship and pain was caused\nto women in the capitalist countries.\nTheir position as sex objects in society\nwas accentuated by these inadequacies\",\nthe communique continued.\nThe socialist countries, the\ncommunique claimed, were way ahead\nof western European countries in\nestablishing equal rights for women.\nHowever, it was noted by some delegates\nthat in Romania, the host country,\nabortion was illegal.\nThe conference rubbed salt into the\nwound by deciding to elect the next\ndelegation from itself despite determined\nopposition from the Executive.\nNO CUTS\" DEMAND IN POSSIBLY the most comprehensive\nof all policy motions passed at this\nconference, total opposition to all\nforms of cuts in Public spending was\nreaffirmed. The Government's economic\npolicy, which is leading to a reduction\nin Social Services and Education\nexpenditure, was deplored and criticised\nthroughout the nine page document\ndealing with \"Grants and Cuts\". The case of 16\u201419 year olds, for\nwhom education in the form of day \u2014\nrelease courses had been promised by\nthe Government, was specifically\nmentioned. Large cut-backs in FE's and\nTech's are expected; and policy is\nnow that we should press for compulsory\n(and fully paid) day-release education\nfor youths who left school at sixteen.\nIt was felt that on this, as other\ntopics, we should liaise more closely\nwith Trades Unions, in the belief that\ncuts affect not just students but the\nwhole of the community. Indeed, the\nsame view was expressed concerning\nthe rise in the pupil-teacher ratio. in\nmost, if not all, schools; especially\nsince, at the same time, trained teachers\nare finding it impossible to get employment as such, and the training colleges\nthemselves are reducing their intake.\nConference resolved that the Government\nmust \"come to terms with the demand\nand need for Education.\"\nWhilst no single point in the grants\ncampaign was prioritized (many felt that\nthey should be); the abolition of the\nmeans test and the discontinuation of\ndiscretionary awards received most\nattention. The Anderson Report of 16\nyears ago called for an end to the means\ntest, but there was still little progress\nin this area. It was claimed, that this\ncaused hardship to students whose\nparents cannot, or choose not to, pay\ntheir \"contribution\". It was also\nstated that the main-rate grant claim\nhas always taken precedence over the\nother, equally important aspects of the\ncampaign; the Press were criticised\nfor heightening this differential \\w ignoring the parts not considered\nnewsworthy. All the same, the motion\nsays, \"the main rate is abysmal . . .\nanything less than the main rate is\ntotally unacceptable\" \u2014 quite clearly a request for a higher grant, of \u00a31140,\nwith no deductions or exceptions.\nEighteen candidates put themselves\nforward for the three posts that were\navailable. Of these, Mr Peter Ashby,\nDeputy President elect (Broad Left), Mr\nAndy Durgin, executive member\n(International Socialist) and Mr Tony\nFekete, Edinburgh University (Con-serva ti ve) were elected.\nThe conference further gave vent to\nits disapproval over the international\nsection of the Union's work by censuring\nChris Morgan, Treasurer elect. Mr Morgan,!\nwas censured for not doing enough work\non the Southern Africa mandate. No\ndirection had been forthcoming from the\nNUS Executive to COS to campaign on\nthis issue it was said.\nWhat was seen as a Broad Left ploy\nto limit debate on the international work\nof the Union was defeated when the\nconference decided to extend time for the\ndebate well into the time allot ed for\nlunch. This came about when the guest\nspeaker from the Chilean NUS, Mr\nAlejandro Rojas, was allowed to speak\nfor nearly 45 minutes \u2014 well over his\nallot ed time \u2014 this taking the morning\nsession right up to lunch.\nPete Ashby\nIn his speech, Mr Rojas praised the\nsolidarity work of the NUS in support\nof the repressed Chilean students.\n\"Every democratic achievement achieved\nduring Allende's government had been\ndestroyed by the present fascist junta,\nMr Rojas said. He called for a day of\nmass action on May 8th to protest against\nthe imprisonment of students and at the\nloss of university autonomy in Chile.\nConference comments\nJackie Webber: \"No conference, you\ncan't suspend the constitution.\"\nPete Ashley: \"The pattern of Tories\ntransfering their votes to Broad Left\ncandidates after the first ballot must be\nseen as a recognition of the Broad\nLeft's remarkable competence.\"\nElections Committee: \"There were so\nmany spoilt papers, Mr Chairman, that\nthe candidate \"Rubbish\" nearly won\nthis election.\"\n(VP Welfare)\nStewart Mcintosh: \" AmI correct in my\nassessment of your parts?\" (to delegate\nrequesting a vote to be taken in said\nmanner)\nCharles Clarke: \"I do intend to be\nrigid.\" (on interpretation of standing\norders)\nAI Stewart: \" The ultra-left is to the\nright of the Broad Left.\"\nAl Stewart: \"I have developed a taste\nfor the jugular veins of Trots.\"\nAl Stewart: The SRP are not a political\ngroup: they are an insult to all other\ngroups on the floor of conference.\"\nCharles Clarke: \"I really must apologise\nfor my voice.''\nS Mcintosh: \"Sir, I think you are trying\nto drill a hole into a piece of wood that\nnobody has got.\"\n\n"

The FCS transferred consistently\nto the Broad Left, giving them the\nnecessary majority in all the top eight\npositions on the Executive. Charles Clarke, last year's President,\nbeat Hugh Lanning (retiring National\nTreasurer) by the 80 or so votes\ntransferred from Mark Hapgood, the\nFCS candidate (who came third), and\nin the same way, Sue Slipman was re-elected to her post of National\nSecretary. Perhaps the greatest shock,\nHugh Lanning\nthough, was when Hugh L anning( Independant Socialist) was beaten by\nChris Morgan in the election for National\nTreasurer; Hugh commands quite a large personal vote, and it has been\nfour years since an incumbent officer\nhas. been defeated in an election. Pete Ashby was elected Deputy President the way made clear by Alistair Stewart's retirement from student politic s.TORY SPOKESMAN Trevor Phillips, J ez Lloyd, Penny\nCooper and Dave Aaronovitch are the\nVicePresident s. Stephen Moon, the\nonly successful FCS candidate, is going to have a hard job on the\nExecutive; he is not only the \" spokesman\" for the Tories, but is, in the eyes of many, the custodian of the Conservative\nPrinciple. How well the FCS do in the\nnext election will depend to a large\nextent on tt is performance.\nThe full Executive for 1976-7 is Charles Clarke( President), Pete\nAshby (Deputy President), Sue Slipman\n(National Secretary), Chris Morgan\n(National Treasurer), Trevor Philip s(VP Areas), J ex Lloyd( VP Welfare),\nPenny Cooper ( VP Education), Dave\nAaronovitch ( VP Services), Kay Copp Brwon, Andy Durgan, Paul Perkins, Paul Blom field, Harry Dean, Stephen\nMoon, and Graham Th rel fall. CONFERENCE CONCISELY...\nSTUDENT PRESS are to be allowed into closed\nsessions at future conferences.\nTHE GRANTS CLAIM is now \u00a31140 for all\nstudents (\u00a31250 in London), with no means test or\ndiscriminatory awards.\nNUS TRAVEL is on the road to recovery, with\na break even expected this year.\nEDUCATION requires a new approach and deep\nanalysis.\nOVERSEAS STUDENTS are not to be left on their\nown, but we can't do it all for them.\nA CONSTITUTION WORKING PARTY has been\nruled out by Conference.\nEEC AFFAIRS need more publicity in the CO's, as does the whole of International work.\nSABBATICAL SALARIES are to be linked to the\ncurrent grants claim.\nFASCISM and RACISM have been denounced and\nits total opposition has been reaffirmed.\nGraduates face dole queue\nONE IN EVERY seven students leaving\ncollege this summer will \"have no chance\nof getting jobs before Christmas, and a substantial part of those will stay on the\ndole queues for far longer\", claimed\nCharles Clarke, NUS President, in his\nopening address to the conference.\nSchool students were, however, in an\neven worse position.\n\" In the cuts which we are told are\nso necessary, the projected number of\nstudents in higher education has been\ncutback to 6 0 0 , 0 0 0 \" , he said. At the same time, the number of school leave rs was steadily increasing\nand this trend would continue into the\n1980's, said Mr Clarke. The Government policies which gave\nrise to this situation and which represented a concerted economic strategy\nwere not being accepted lying down.\nThe fight to change these policies, and\nthis economic strategy, was one to\nwhich the whole of the student movement\nmust be committed, Mr Clarke said,\" The question at stake is whether we can change the course of society?\" In order to do this, said Mr Clarke, the NUS\" must put forward an alternative\neconomic solution and win to its side\nthe student body. If we do not succeed\nin that we condemn ourselves to\npolitical impotence.\" Continuing his attack on the Government, Mr Clarke accused them of\nspreading, through conventional political life, cynicism among the membership of\nthe national union. Cynicism had become\nthe political watchword, as the Labour\nGovernment had become the government\nof the Establishment, he said.\nIt was the duty of the NUS to break\ndown this cynicism and to overcome the\nrejection of political life that existed\namong many members of the Union. \" All students must recognise that the decisions of government matter to us all\", Mr\nClarke said.\n\n"

    "content": "4 MU X Closed sessions and\nthe student press\nFOLLOWING THE decision, taken in the first session of\nconference, that Finance Committee Report on NUS Services\n(Travel, Marketing and Endsleigh) should not be held in\nclosed session, a constitutional amendment allowing\nStudent Press into closed sessions was carried over-w helm ingly. The opposition to this move was, not un justifiably due to inaccurate reports of the NUS Travel financial\nsituation (in the main) which many Executive members and\nothers considered irresponsible. No doubt, since first hand\ninformation will be available in the future, the accuracy of\nsuch articles will improve.\nSome felt that the Student Press were ad is pensi ble luxury; delegates should report back to their SRC's/ UGM's, and all the Student Press can do is cut the ground from\nunder their feet. But, on the whole, it was realised that the\nStudent Press has a valuable role to play in relaying,\naccurately, information that the Nationals would rather\nignore or distort. Since our readership is higher than the\nattendances at UGM's, etc, we are obviously in a good\nposition to bridge that \"communication gap\".\nIt must be remembered, however, that the representatives\nof the Student Press at conference are not elected; they are\nnot delegates fallowing mandates. Nor must they, in any\nway whatsoever, be allowed to interfere in the running of\nconference. They are, in the strictest sense, observers, but\nas such must be allowed to observe the proceedings in their\nen tir it y. But the new ruling does mean that the current arrangements\nfor Student Press representatives are totally unacceptable;\nthe security element at present is zero, and, although\nPress badges were issued, no credentials were ever checked\nObviously an unsatisfactory state of affairs if we are to\nbe allowed to view the deepest and darkest secrets of the\nUnion.\nThe Tory challenge\nTHE ANTICIPATED, and much publicised, Tory challenge\nof the Federation of Conservative Students (FCS) seemed to\nfizzle out immediately after the Presidential Election, when\ntheir candidate was beaten into third place.They, effectively,\nheld the balance of power between the Broad Left (Labour\nParty and Communist Party alliance) and the more extreme\nleft wing (the IMG, IS, etc.) with a transfer of about 85 votes\ngoing con sisian tl) to the Broad Left candidates. Their\nstrength has risen, however, since the Scarborough\nConference when they had just over a dozen delegates.\nThis has been reflected by the fact that they now have\none executive member, Steve Moon, and means that their\npolicies will have a platform at National level. Just how\nseriously the Broad Left are taking the FCS will be seen\nwhen Mr Moon receives his specific resp on sib li ties. Their success/failure at the next conference will\ndepend to a great extent on the policies expounded by Mr\nMoon, it will also require the FCS to put forward some\ncommitted and experienced leaders. It is quite obvious that\nthe Broad Left had been opposed to a Tory on the executive,\nthey could, by putting forward stronger candidates for the\nlower positions, have prevented it. Of course, if they had\nno stronger candidates to provide the back-up, they couldn't prevent the FCS getting at least one seat if they had\nwanted to. The fact that David Willis was narrowly (by 7\nvotes) defeated by the Broad Left candidate would indicate\nthe latter being the case.\nPRIZE CROSSWORD No. 33\n1 X34SL7 r it\nr14rr1 T22.04r it V1r Li12.

According to an editorial published in its latest issue,' between seventy and eighty per\ncent of those students (claiming\nbenefit) will have just hammered one more nail into\nthe coffin of the Nation'. Excuses usually given for\nnot finding a vacation job\n(especially during Christmas\nand Easter) were dismissed as\nfeeble and inadequate.\"Students\nshould be resourceful enough\nto find sufficient time for their\nacademic work even if they are\nworking forty hours a week\", the paper said. It was rarely\ndifficult, the paper claims, for\nstudents to find work as say\nbarmen or petrol pump attendants if they tried.\nClaiming benefit, the paper\nsays,\" is an act of apathy and\nselfishness which jeo pardi ses not only their own future but\nthat of the entire nation'.'\nIt described as \" most despicable\" the reason,\" If I took a job I would be\ndepriving someone else of the\nright to work and consequently\nworsening the unemployment\nsituation\". It would cost the\nnation nearly \u00a321 million if\nevery student received only the\nminimum entitlement during the\nEaster vacation alone. An NUS spokesman,however,\ndisagreed with the points made\nby Omega. The unemployment\nlevel had hit students badly\nand the situation was so bad\nthat traditional employers,such\nas the big stores and h te GPO had offered very few jobs\nduring the Christmas vacation. The NUS see social security\nas a safety net for those on low pay and fixed incomes. The\nspokesman also pointed out that\naccording to their survey, 57%\nof students on mandatory awards\ndid not receive the full parental\ncontribution to their grant. Half the student population did not\nreceive the vacation element,\n\u00a33.80 per week for those on a full grant, as a result.\nMs Sue Slipman, NUS National Secretary, said yesterday;\n\"I believe that anyone who is\nsupposed to serve the interests\nof students could do that better\nthan by attacking students\nwho are victims of the present\ncrisis, along with the vast\nmajority of working people in\nthis country.\nMISS JULIA ROSS, above,\nis the new President of\nL' Institute Francais du\nRoyaune\u2014Uni Secretarial\nCollege Students' Union, popularly known as IF.

    "content": "Sabbatical salaries slashed\nFULL TIME OFFICERS( F TO' s) of the\nNUS executive are to have their salaries linked to the grant claim. They will now\nreceive a net salary of 52/30th s of what\nthe Union considers is a fair grant.\nOfficers who previously received \u00a33,200\nplus \u00a3100 for each re-election will now\nbe on about \u00a32,600.\nThis situation raises the possibility of future conferences voting for small or\nzero increase in the main rate grant\nclaim if it is decided that F TO' s should\nnot receive a big pay increase. However\nthis is rather unlikely;. thus in this\n\" index linked\" type situation, the F TO' s seem to be guaranteed annual salary\nincreases in future. Previously, F TO' s had to negotiate for pay increases and\nthis year had agreed not to receive an\nincrease, in view of the Union's financial situation.\nThe constitution debate was, however,\nmore concerned with the direct election of the executive by national secret ballot.\nBut once again, direct elections were\ndecisively rejected by the conference.\nThe resolution, which was eventually\ncarried by a two-thirds majority .condemns\ndirect election of the executive as undesirable, expensive, impractical,\nand liable to lead to bureaucracy and\ncareer is m. Two major amendments were put to\nthe main motion, one backed by the\nConservatives and the other by the\nultra left.\nMr. Steve Moon, executive member, in\nmoving the Conservative backed amendment, called for a\" coll, long look\nat the constitution\". To do this, the con ference should elect a working party of\nten b\\S TV to \" investigate the feasibility\nof the direct election of the NUS exec Con tin u ed from p.7 Solidarity with overseas students\nabused in certain cases.\" Overseas students are here by invitation and\nshould accept the decisions of a democratically elected government,\"\nMr Fairbairn said.\" It was up to each\ngovernment to ensure the post school\neducation of its own nationals, he added.\nReplying to this, a delegate from\nPortsmouth Polytechnic said the NUS had a commitment to the aim that education\nis a right. \"Who invited the bloody British imperialists into half the word anyway?*, he asked. At this point the debate became a heated and severe condemnation of\nfascism with \u2022 Ms Valerie Coultas\nleading the attack. She accused the\nBroad Left of backing down on the\nquestion of opposing fascism by any\nmeans in the face of the campaigned\nwaged by the bourgeois e press. The amendment was even more\ndecisively defeated than the first one. The remaining amendments were also defeated. Mr Trevor Phillips summing up\non the main motion said he did not\nwant to see overseas students sold\ndown the drain. \" The Government is using overseas students as scapegoats.\nThe only way to fight this is to preserve\nunity with overseas students. If we\nlose this fight, then I think we have lost\nthe whole fight against cuts\", he warned.\nThe motion. calls for organised\naction including picketing, lobbying and\nproperly co-ordinated disruptions of\nmeetings discussing the fees and number\nof overseas students \"where this can influence those decisions in favour of\noverseas students\". uti ve and report on the alternatives\ninvolved.\" Mr. Peter Teague, ICU President, supporting the amendment,said that a look at the representative nature of NUS was required. 'I hope we won't see Mr.\nStewart speaking on this motion and make\nunrepresentative statements about the\nundemocratic Electoral Reform Society,\" he added. He was later to be di sap pointed in his wish. Chris Morgan, National Treasurer,\nopposing the amendment, said that it\nproposed disunity at a time when a fighting NUS was needed to combat educational cutbacks and an iniquitous\ngrants system. The amendment was heavily\ndefeated by332810 votes to 110 516\nwith 50 874 abstentions - a majority of\nPete Teague\n3 to 1.\nThe second amendment, backed by\nthe ultra left, supported the main resolution in rejecting direct elections. Instead\nit called for the election by STV of the\nbottom eleven members of the NUS exec. The amendment was thrown out by a majority of 2 to 1.\nAn amendment mandating the NUS executive to allow the colleges of Oxford\nand Cambridge to use the Conference\nSubsidy Fund was defeated by a subs\nt anti al majority. During the debate, the\nMerton College delegate ( moving the\namendment ) described the executive as fascists. It was resolved to hold composite\nmeetings prior to the two NUS conferences to ena bie individual colleges to\nget m and ation on the final drafts of motions\nthat appear before these conferences.\nTheN US holds two conferences a year,\none in the autumn and one at Easter. The conference also decided that,\nin future, the student press would be\nadmitted into the closed sessions of\nconference. The amendment which proposed this move instructs the NUS exec\" to fully inform the student press of\nmajor moves within the campaigning and\nservice activities of the Union.\" The NUS is to hold a one- day conference on the question of its structure\nand communications. In addition, a survey is being mounted to look into the\nway colleges elect their delegates.\nIt will now be possible for students to\nfind out who are the candidates standing\nfor NUS executive posts. This follows\na recommendation in the main motion\nthat candidates manifestos should be\ndistributed to colleges at least six weeks\nbefore conference.\nCritical look at education\nsystem needed\nA MOTION calling on the NUS to take a searching and critical look into the\neducation system as a whole was unanimously agreed to by the conference.\nThe motion identified four fundamental\nissues affecting post school education\ntoday viz, the poor level of finance,\ndemocracy, content and structure of\neducation.\nCentral validation of all further and\nhigher education courses and compulsory\npart-time education for all workers\nbetween 16 and 19 are called for. The latter call was embodied in a successful amendment sponsored by the Part Time\nStudents National Committee. It was opposed by IC. Mr Rick Park er,IC Union Academic\nAffairs Officer, opposing the amendment\nsaid he objected to the word 'compulsory'.\nThe amend, said Mr Parker, was \" a rubbishy amendment\".\nThe motion advocates continuous\nassessment in favour of competitive\nassessment. The abolition of the latter\nshould be the long term aim of the\nNational Union. Examinations, the\nresolution declares,\" can restrict\neducational opportunity and can, therefore, be detrimental to the community\nas well as the participants.\" Examinations\nonly tested the candidates ability to\nassimilate information.\nRick Parker\nOn the question of course content,\nthe motion says \" All courses must be\nthe subject of consultation between\"\nstudents, staff and representatives from\nsubsequent fields of work; students should\nnot be provided with 'terminal' courses\nwhich become educational, 'blind alleys' wasteful in time, effort and resources.\" Individual colleges are instructed to\nform content committees in every\ndepartment with equal representation of\nstudents academic and non-academic\nstaff. In addition, colleges should set\ndepartmental staff-student academic\nboards which would be responsible for,\nand take all decisions affecting the\ndepartment.\nThe motion also commits the NUS to\nfighting against \" the increasing control\nof education by business and military\ninterests.\" Reports by\nPaul Ekpenyong\nand Duncan S uss.

    "content": "MU X7N US Services report, Easter 1976\nNUS Travel-the hardest road back\nNUS TRAVEL will break even this\nyear, and is in a good position to recoup\n. its \u00a3'4 million deficit over the next four\nyears. This was the message from Mr.\nMike Naylor, Managing Director of NUS Travel Services Ltd, at this year's Llandudno Conference.\nIn a briefing, he explained that the\nfigure of \u00a3250,000 was grossly inflated\nby the way in which the accounting\nprocedure had been altered \u2014the January/ December financial year was changed to\nMay/ May \u2014 to make reports to Conference\nmore accurate and up to date. This itself was loss making, due to in effie nci es, mistakes, and the fact that a large outlay\nwas required to move headquarters\nfrom London to Cheltenham Spa.\nSATA flight records out by \u00a3 9 0 , 0 0 0\nBut the worst loss, he pointed out,\nwas the discrepancy amounting to some\n\u00a390,000 between their record of flight\nbookings and those held by SATA, the\ninternational student flight administrators.\nSince this was brought to light, fortnightly checks have been made, and all the staff handling the TELEX booking\nequipment have been retrained and\ntested. This has brought the previous\nerror rate of 3% (costing about \u00a312,000\nlast year) .down to less than 0.6% for\nJanuary and February of this year,\nNU STS streamlined\nIn fact, the whole company has been\ncut back and trimmed until only the\nessentials remain 40 of the previous\n60 flights and train routes have been\ndropped, leaving just the most popular\nlines still running, and as a result, a possible further \u00a380,000 loss has been\ninto a breakdown situation for this\nyear. Unfortunately, the cutbacks meant\nthat 8 people were no longer employable;\nthe redundancies caused an angry flare-up at Conference, but, on the whole, it\nwas realised that the choice was of\nsome redundancies or more redundancies\nand possible bankruptcy.'\nFair play NU STS has an ever increasing share\nof the student market, and Mr. Nayldr,\nis confident that, given fair play, this\nsummer will realise a profit of over\n\u00a3280,000 - which, allowing \u00a3200,000 to\ncover the winter \" slump\", will make up\nthe on-going deficit of i> A million\nwithin four years if continued.\nOn the subject of fair play, he\npointed out that some foreign students'\ntravel services are operating (quite\nun ethically, in his opinion) within the\nUK, selling( and getting commission on)\nsome of NU STS' s own flights. He asked\nall students to notice that these\npractices were going on and called on all students to boycott these companies.\nOther competitors ( specifically, Transalpine), he said, were \"no longer\nso much cheaper than ourselves\". In a recent check, of the Easter brochure,\nNUSTS were cheaper on some routes by\nup to 20%.' This is due to the\ninternational cooperation of some\nEuropean Students' Travel Services in bulk-buying train space, and could\nbring prices even lower if demand was\nsufficient.\n\" Set Off\" agreement\nMr. Naylor also explained the \" Set Off\" agreement with the bank; it does not\nmean that the bank can confiscate funds\nof the National Union. What it does\nmean is that, in the event of any of the\nNUS Services going bankrupt, and at the\nsame time having an overdraft at the\nbank, the bank has the right to take the\namount of that overdraft from any of the\nother accounts in credit: this would then\nbe reclaimed from the receiver put in charge of the case. In return, for the\npurposes of calculating overdraft\ninterest charges, the accounts are\nsimply treated as one, and so the\namount paid is considerably less, as most of the accounts are in credit for\nthe period when NU STS is in overdraft.\nNUS Marketingbeer's the latest\nthing\nNUS Marketing, set up in January, is branching out into the field of beer: it has arranged with the Yorkshire brewery\nThe aks ton, to supply their beers to\nUnion Bars throughout the country. We\nwere given a chance to sample the\nwares at the NUS Services Disco, where the Old Pec u lier( Theakston's Strong Ale) flowed freely: it is indeed a brew worth sampling, and I look forward\nto the possibility of having it in our\nUnion. They also have wine, T shirts, calculators, and a whole store of other\nlines \u2014 all of which are selling well and proving the need for the companies\nexistence. Endsleigh-6-month\npolicy hit with\nstudent\nEnd sleigh Insurance's new 6-month\npolicy, underwritten by the Federation\nMutual Insurance Limited, may not be\nthe cheapest on the market, but the\ncompany feels that the ease with which\nthe system operates will in time bring\nthe overheads, and hence the premiums,\ndown to a much lower level. They say that the reduced paperwork involved,\nthe simplicity of the pricing system,\nand the competitiveness of the scheme\nare attracting 600 students a week.\nLast year's loss( the first recorded for\nmany years) does not appear to be\nrepeating this year: the figures so far\nindicate that there will be a trading\nprofit of some \u00a370,000.\nSolidarity with overseas students\nA RESOLUTION con deming the attacks\non overseas students as ra sci stand\" calculated to divide and weaken the\nwhole student body in its opposition to\nthe educational cutbacks\" was overwhelmingly carried with only two votes\nagainst. These attacks, the resolution\nsaid, were \" only a per cursor to attacks\non the entire student body.\" The resolution also rejected the\n\" myths and lies spread about overseas\nstudents\", in the press. It noted the\ndefeat of the ILEA proposal to cut back\nthe number of overseas students in ILEA colleges by 60% and the agreement\nsigned by LSO( London Student\nOrganisation) and the Inner London Division of NA THE( National Association of Teachers in Higher Education)\nopposing these and any such proposals.\nThe resolution itself was moved by\nMr A Tuker, a Turkish student at the\nCity University. By the implementation\nof imperialist policies overseas,\nstudents had been deprived of the right\nto education in their own countries, he\nsaid. \"Without the support of British students, overseas students cannot\ncampaign effectively against the fees\nincrease and victim is ation they faced.\" Overseas students were not the vanguard\nof the anti-discrimination fight \u2014 the\nfight had to be a\" shoulder to shoulder\" one with British students, he concluded.\nA Trot amendment attacking the NUS executive for not showing any initiative\non the issue of overseas students and\ndescribing NUS publicity on the plight\nof overseas students as\" offensive and\npassive\" was decisively defeated.\nThe amendment that brought the\nconference to the boil, however, was that table by TACT, the College of\nCommerce and Technology in Hull. The TACT speakers were consistently\nheckled and had considerable difficulty\nin putting across their case for British first.\nTrevor Phillips\nMr Nicholas Fairbairn, moving the\namendment, said that the high standard\nof education in this country was a marketable commodity which had been\nContinued on page 8\n\n"
