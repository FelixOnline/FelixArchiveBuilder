    "content": "Film Review\nFRIDAY 3RD DECEMBER 2021\nEdited by: Eva Borras\nFilm\nFilm.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk 21\nThe Electrical Life of Louis Wain\nDirectedby: Will Sharpe\nStarring: Benedict Cumberbatch, Claire Foy,\nAndrea Riseborough, Toby Jones\nEva Borras Film Editor\nThis 2021 feature coming to cinemas on New\nYears day tells the story of British artist Louis\nWain, a successful yet eccentric illustrator born in the\n19th century mostly known for his peculiar style in\ndrawing cats. Played by Benedict Cumberbatch, the\nfilm follows Wains\u2019 personal adult life in parallel to his\npublic figure presence after his dad dies and he is left\nto provide for his mother and sisters.\nThe feature begins by introducing Louis doing what\nhe later on becomes famous for, drawing. The audience\nfollows his career from the beginning and slowly gets\nto know the main characters of the film: his sister\u2019s\ngoverness Emily Richardson (Claire Foy), his sister\nCaroline (Andrea Riseborough) and Sir William\nIngram( Toby Jones), the editor of the Illustrated\nLondon News who happens to offer him a job as an\nillustrator.\nFrom my point of view, the film could be divided\ninto two different parts as the focus of the story\nchanges slightly somewhere in the middle. At first\nthe plot is completely based on the growing love story\nbetween Louis and Emily, with no focus on his career\nas an artist. At times it felt like the movie would be\nbased only on their romance, however it is true that\nthere is a turning point when Wain\u2019s illustrations start\nto get recognition from the public and the film starts\nto deviate into highlighting his uniqueness as an artist\nfor drawing psychedelic-like cats. Personally, I think\nthe link between the start of his obsession with cats\nis well explained; the director carefully portrays how\nthe adoption of a cat in his personal life completely\ninfluences his focus of work in his professional life.\nSimilarly, it would be unfair to not mention the\namazing casting for the film, it was great to see how\neveryone completely disguised themselves in their\ncharacters, especially Cumberbatch. Although the\nthemes of the film vary throughout and the end left me\nfeeling bittersweet, the main message is clear: there is\nalways a reason to hold on and keep being motivated to\nenjoy life. As Richardson tells Wain: \u201cthe world is full\nof beauty. And it\u2019s up to you to capture it, Louis\u201d.\nIn terms of cinematography, The Electrical Life of\nLouis Wain stands out by the chosen 4:3 frame ratio\nandcolourfulvibrantcoloursduringspecificscenes\u2013as\nwell as a couple of shots which recreate a painting-like\naesthetic to ensure that the viewer gets a fixed image in\ntheir head of the important parts of the film.\nOverall, Sharpe\u2019s feature is an entertaining biopic\nthat doesn\u2019t go into detail about the mental health\nissues faced in the artist\u2019s adult life \u2013 but rather how he\nused his paintings to express the different ways he saw\nthe world. Thank you so much to StudioCanal for the\nopportunity to attend a screening before the premiere!\nThe Boy and the World(O menino e o Mundo)\nDirectedby: Al\u00ea Abreu\nYear: 2013\nFilm Review\nThe Boy and the world is a wonderful hidden gem in\nthe world of animated movies.\nAyoungboyliveshappilyinthecountrysidewithhis\nparents but one day his father disappears after hopping\non a train to look for a job. The little boy is very sad\nand goes on a journey to bring his family back together again. Throughout his quest, he is confronted with\nmany issues: poverty in the favelas, inequalities, environmental catastrophes, loneliness\u2026 But he also meets\nkind people and he is shown compassion. The atmosphere fluctuates between wonders and nostalgia.\nIt is completely free from dialogue so you don\u2019t have\nto worry about not understanding Brazilian and/or\nlooking for a version with subtitles. Sometimes, you\ncan hear the characters speaking gibberish but you\ndon\u2019t need to understand them to follow the movie. It\nis an immersive experience that relies on fantastic visuals and an endearing Brazilian soundtrack.\nNow, the visuals are probably the most enticing element of The Boy and the World. The style evokes naive drawings of children and as such everything looks\nhandmade \u2013 it was created using a mix of drawing/\npainting and digital animation. The colours are bright\nand vivid and make the visuals really stand out. Almost\nall of the frames could be framed and hung on a wall.\nKids and adults can watch this incredible film because it has multiple layers of understanding and there\nis no graphic content that could shock a child. However, a lot of mature themes are tackled and it is definitely\nricher to watch this movie as an adult.\nIt is the second film of Al\u00ea Abreu and it won the\nBest Feature Film at the Annecy International Animated Film Festival and the Best Animated Feature-Independent at the Annie Awards. Despite its critical suc-cess,themovieisnotthatwell-knownwhichisashame.\nNext time you want to watch a good animation other than a Ghibli or a Disney/Pixar production, think of\n\u00ab The Boy and the world\nAur\u00e9lia Bordes Film Writer\n\n"

Duras was almost 70,\nwhile Andr\u00e9a was 38 years her junior at the time, but\ndespite their age difference the two of them had been\nliving together for almost 2 years, entertaining a very\nintense relationship fuelled by mutual infatuation.\nI Want to Talk About Duras (Vous ne d\u00e9sirez que\nmoi) brings to the screen an interview diving deep into\nDuras and Andr\u00e9a\u2019s affair and personal lives. In the\nbeginning, Andr\u00e9a is only a fervent admirer of Duras\u2019\nwork, but soon enough, once she begins to return his\naffections, that fascination develops into him casting\naside his entire life to be with her.\nThe connection between them is a complicated and\ntoxic one. On one side, we have this ardent attraction\n- a sexually charged passion for one another, which is\nsupported by Andr\u00e9a\u2019s statement that he feels he had\nnever made love before his encounter with Duras.\nOntheotherside,wehaveDuras\u2019needtocompletely\ncontrolherlover.Theirrelationshipinvolveshisabsolute\nsubmission to her and everything that surrounds her\nexistence, to the point where she addresses him using\nfeminine pronouns to assert her dominance.\nEverything that he suggests is never good enough,\nreading or watching something other than her\nbooks or movies is a betrayal, having other friends is\ninconceivable. She desperately tries to make him fit her\nown image of what their love should be, but Andr\u00e9a\nalways disappoints. He is aware of this and that evokes\nsome sort of violence as part of their intimacy, which\nthedirectordepictsthroughwatercolorportraitsofthe\ntwo throughout the movie. Violence in bed is the only\nway for him to rebel and the only one allowed.\nYann Andr\u00e9a was Duras\u2019 to deconstruct and rebuild\naccording to her own standards. She included him in\nher writing and her films and through that she made\nsurethathewouldeternallybeapartofher.Inherwork\n\u201cThe Malady of Death\u201d, she associates homosexuality\nwithdeathinadesperateattempttosupresshisidentity\nand \u201chomosexual tendencies\u201d. It was obvious that what\nshe was transmitting was that he should only desire her\nand nothing more. It could be said that her jealousy\nhad turned her towards homophobia.\nInconclusion,IWantToTalkAboutDurasisahighly\nintellectualized view on a toxic relationship. The twists\nand turns of this dark human interaction are powerful\nenough to maintain this feature. A feature that\nbasically presents two people talking about a subject\nconsidered taboo at the time and maybe even today.\nWhat is important to recognise, in my opinion, is that\nthe dialogue was portrayed exactly as it was recorded\nin 1982 and it can easily be seen how differently issues\nregardingmentalhealthandsexualitywereapproached\nback then. It is wonderful to realise that we have since\nevolved into a world that recognises that sexuality can\nbe fluid and that \u201clove\u201d should not revolve around a\nsingular individual and it should not be all-consuming,\nbut mutual, uplifting, and kind.\nDirectedby: Claire Simon\nStarring: Swann Arlaud, Emmanuelle Devos\nBogdana-Gabriela Nica Film Writer\nUne histoire d\u2019amour et de d\u00e9sir\nATale of Love and Desire (Une histoire d\u2019amour et\nde d\u00e9sir) follows the friendship and love story\nof two students in college: Ahmed and Farah - both\ntaking part of the comparative literature class where\nthey meet and where the movie sets off. From very\ndifferent cultures and backgrounds, this delicate\nfeature by Leyla Bouzid seduces the audience to feel\nthe love and passion between the characters.\nAhmed is a French-Algerian boy who is struggling\nwithhisselfidentity-doeshefeelmoreFrenchormore\nAlgerian? This internal conflict is carefully and very\nconvincingly expressed by the actor Outalbali. On the\nother hand we have Farah, a Tunisian girl who has just\narrived in France and is adapting to living in a new city\non her own, she is beautifully played by Zbeida.\nWhat surprised me the most was how successful\nthe director is at telling such a passion driven story ,\nespecially with the chosen underlying sensual tone\nand intimacy between the two youngsters. Most of the\nspecialsceneswereshotwithvoiceoverstohighlightthe\nintimacyofthemoment-whichtheaudiencedefinitely\ngets emotionally invested in. Bouzid manages to create\nan outstanding and raw piece with a clear focus on the\nbuild up of tension between two people as they figure\nout their feelings.\nOverall, this French movie will not disappoint you\nif you are looking for a slow visual description of how\nsensitive lust and desire can be.\nDirectedby: Leyla Bouzid\nStarring: Sami Outalbali, Zbeida Belhajamor,\nDiong-K\u00e9ba Tacu, Aur\u00e9lia Petit, Mahia Zrouki\nEva Borras Film Editor\nFFF: French Film Festival\nThe UK French Film Festival took place in the first weeks of November, screening 17 features in the London Cin\u00e9 Lumi\u00e8re venue.\nThe Felix Film team had the opportunity to watch Une histoire d\u2019amour et de d\u00e9sir (A Tale of Love and Desire) and Vous ne d\u00e9sirez que moi (I Want to Talk About Duras),\ntwo films directed by women which you can find reviews of in this page.\nThank you so much to the organisers for this chance!\n\n"

Further to this, immunity\nappears to wane significantly after\nsix months, leading to the UK\u2019s\nsubstantial booster jab roll-out. LICs\ncurrently stand with only 5.8% of\ntheir populations having received a\nsingle dose of vaccine, with populous\ncountries such as Ethiopia at just 3%.\nTargets for vaccination in LICs span\nyears, the fact that waning immunity\nmakes the target wholly unreachable\nis apparently irrelevant.

Their\npassion aligned with the subject they had a particular\ntalent for \u2013 it was a done deal. Others, torn between\ninterests, found the decision less obvious. Elena\nAndreicheva was drawn to a range of disciplines: art,\nscience and maths, history and philosophy. She chose\nto study Physics because it was, in her words, \u201cthe one\nthing I probably can\u2019t do in my spare time, so I\u2019ll just\ngo and do a degree in that.\u201d\nI talked to Elena (via a video call generously\nsqueezed in between childcare responsibilities) about\nher time at university and how it led to the life she\nhas now: acclaimed producer and director of hardhittingdocumentaries.She\u2019sworkedwiththeBBC,the\nDiscovery Channel and National Geographic to name\na few. Released in 2019, she produced Learning to\nSkateboard in a Warzone (if you\u2019re a girl), which won\nthe BAFTA for Best British Short and the Academy\nAward for Best Documentary Short. It\u2019s not an obvious\ncareer path. In fact, many people\nfound it (somewhat patronisingly)\nhard to believe at first.\n\u201cI mean, it\u2019s meant in a very nice\nway, but when people used to find\nout I\u2019d studied Physics when I was\nstarting out on TV, and even now,\nthey\u2019re like: Oh, is that right?!\nI even got a letter from some\nuniversity in Kiev - which is where\nI was born and grew up \u2013 from\nsome professor querying that I had.\n[Physics] is seen as such its own\nthing, impenetrable for others, and\nI think that\u2019s a shame.\u201d\nThough Elena has an evident,\nlasting affection for science, she\ndidn\u2019t find studying it easy. \u201cI was\nnot the world\u2019s best physics student. Everybody who\ncomes to Imperial thinks they\u2019re the bee\u2019s knees... as I\nrecall. They\u2019re coming as the best out of school, if not\nlike \u2018I\u2019m so bored at school, it\u2019s so easy\u2019. It was pretty\noverwhelming.\u201d The struggle to get \u201cuniversity-good\u201d\nfast enough made the first year difficult.\nAn assignment in second year rearranged her view\nof things. Students had to write a semi-technical,\nsemi-entertaining piece on a topic within physics\nthat interested them. \u201cWhat was weird is that writing\nactually reawakened my interest in physics itself, and I\ndid much better in my second year.\u201d\nThe fact that writing and science didn\u2019t have to exist\nseparately appealed to her. \u201cI really enjoyed it, and\ndid quite well with it, and thought OK well, actually,\nI should really consider this.\u201d Although Elena didn\u2019t\nknow of it as a discipline at the time, it was Elena\u2019s\nfirst foray into science communication. Later in the\ndegree, when someone mentioned Imperial\u2019s Science\nCommunication masters to her, she thought: \u201cWell\nthis sounds literally perfect.\u201d\nShe gives a lot of credit to the people who ran the\nmasters programme. \u201cTheir connections are so good in\nthe industry. People coming out of the course are very\nlikely to get hooked up with an assisting job, which can\nlead to better jobs. Starting out on TV is a bit thankless\nreally. My first job in TV, thanks to the Imperial\nconnection, was way better than it would have been\nhad I been coming into it raw.\u201d\nElenawentontoachievewhat\nmany aspire to: the marriage of\nher personal and professional\ninterests. Sort of. \u201cI was always a\nbig film buff, but I\u2019d never really\nthought: Oh, documentary\nfilmmaker, that sounds like a\ngreat career! Because if I had,\nthat probably would have been\nquite useful. Nonetheless,\nthere was no-one in my life\nwho presented this role model.\nSo I was like OK, journalism,\nyeah yeah, I\u2019m good at writing,\nI really like it. OK. My career\n[started with] work experience\nwith someone who was also a\nfilmproducer,sothatshowedmewhatafilmthat\u2019skind\nof journalistic could be. Which was kind of always my\nhope,somethingIwasalwaysinterestedin.ThenIgota\nyear-longcontractwithaproductioncompanyworking\nonabigseries.Thethingthathookedmewasn\u2019toohthe\njoys of the minutiae of film production, because at that\nlevel, you\u2019re not really doing lots of filming yourself,\nor seeing things happen, or editing it - you\u2019re running\naround and doing small things. But I liked that it was\nall part of something that had a social conscience. That\nwas always a bit of a driving thing for me, to work on\nfilms that I felt were exploring interesting themes, were\ntapping into important geopolitical issues.\u201d\nThese wide-reaching interests had been developed\nin the reading she did alongside her undergraduate\ndegree - reading that absorbed more and more time as\nthe degree went on. Which isn\u2019t to say that she couldn\u2019t\nhandle the course, or enjoy it. \u201cI love maths. I like the\nneatness of maths.\u201d She also cites labs as a highlight,\nalthough she appreciates how constrained it is as an\nundergraduate. \u201cThey\u2019re designed to get you to achieve\nvaguely the answer they think you\u2019re going to achieve.\nYou\u2019re not going to discover something extraordinary\nin labs in your first three years of Physics at Imperial \u2013\nor are you? I mean, I don\u2019t know. I wasn\u2019t.\n\u201c\nMY FIRST JOB IN\nTV, THANKS TO\nTHE IMPERIAL\nCONNECTION, WAS\nWAY BETTER THAN\nIT WOULD HAVE\nBEEN HAD I BEEN\nCOMING INTO IT\nRAW\n\n"

This did not intimidate\nthe defense who came out strong out of\nthe gate, starting with a four and out and\nnot letting go till the final whistle. The\noffence did not stay far behind and led\nby a dominant performance by the offensive line made way for Nathan \u201cMan\nofSlug\u201dBoachietoputupyardscarryafter carry. These efforts paid off and lead\nto a touchdown on a fourth and goal by\na familiar face to the vets: Jonas \u201cDreadnought Slim\u201d Eschenfelder. Unfortunately, the offence was not able to put\nmore points up on the scoreboard, fighting not only the Burners\u2019 defence but\nalso penalties (some of which came out\nof nowhere). This put pressure on the\ndefensive unit to keep playing their best\nand they did. Against a dominant defensive line performance, which limited inside runs and pressured the opposition\u2019s\nquarterback, the Burners had limited\noptions and despite repeatedly trying to\nrun the ball outside they did not manage\nto put points on the scoreboard. During\ntheir final drive, they repeatedly tried to\nscore by throwing deep shots but these\nefforts were cut short by Jon \u201cPoker\nFace\u201d Brunton who made the game-seal-ing interception, his second of the game.\nThe last seconds were still a thrill ride for\nthe sideline, with a very long and messy\nseries of kneel-downs but in the end,\nno coach ended up with a heart attack\nand the Immortals came out victorious.\nTwo weeks after that win, both teams\nmet again, this time at Imperial\u2019s Sports\nGrounds which tried to scare all players\nby possibly freezing overnight.

The\noffence also came out swinging with major pushes by the offensive line where a\nstandout performance was delivered by\nAbdullah \u201cQuiet Assassin\u201d Erinjogunola. This led to a rushing touchdown by\nNathan, who enjoys playing significantly more since learning to run through\ngaps, giving Immortals the lead. The\nBurners returned the favour on a broken\nrun, leading to the score being tied 6-6\nat halftime.

It is believed that the iPad was\nstoring so many unread emails that its\nattempts to channel electricity from the\nmains it was plugged into for charging\ncaused an infinitely dense accumulation\nof energy a black hole was produced.\nThe owner of the tablet, who had left\nthe building momentarily, admits he\nprobably should have kept his inbox more\norganised. \u201cYeah it all started with the\nthird department newsletter,\u201d explained\nRichard Inakunt, 3rd year Aeroengineer.\n\u201cAnd then all the best deal emails from\nAmazon.

The\nflavoursofthekebabarewhatyou\u2019dexpectbutsomuch\nmore refined and better in my opinion. Marinated in a\nyogurt based sauce that includes lemon juice, minced\nonion, saffron and tomatoes, it was a flavour bomb.\nTypicallyIfindthatchickenbreastcansometimescome\nout quite dry, due to the nature of the meat and people\nnot knowing how to cook it correctly for that reason.\nHowever, In my case the chicken was cooked just right\nand was sizzling when served. Finally, when wrapped\nin warm bread and lightly coated by the mazehs that we\nhad ordered, the whole experience changed and was so\nenjoyableandfuntoeat.Foranyonewhowantstovisit,\nthis is a must get.\nThe Koobideh Kabab is a skewer of minced lamb\nshoulders, mixed in with rendered onions and black\npeppers. The lamb shoulder cooked wonderfully,\nmaintaining a juicy yet succulent interior which was\nmuch more tender than the Jujeh Kabab. The lamb was\nequally as enjoyable, and was paired wonderfully with\nthe fluffy yet crunchy saffron infused rice. The juices\nfrom the minced lamb provided extra flavour for the\nrice, which was washed down with a generous glass of\nstill water.\nFinally, I didn\u2019t try the Jigar Kebab as its liver based\nwhich I don\u2019t like. However I did ask for my friend\u2019s\nopinion on them, to which he described it as nice\ngood quality liver with the taste being smokey. He also\nmentioned that the Jigar didn\u2019t have gristle on it which\nhe also appreciated.\nBerenjak only has one dessert available which is\nthe Darlish Baklava ice cream sandwich, and it sure\ndoesn\u2019t disappoint. Along with some bitter Persian tea,\nthe baklava was a joy to eat and was devilicious sweet\nand delectable, also the filo pastry was super flaky and\ncrunchy as expected. After a meal you\u2019ll find yourself\nquite full - so sharing one baklava between two people\nis more than enough to satisfy your sweet tooth. We\ndefinitely recommend you to get it along with some\ntea, as it washes away the extreme sweetness from the\nsyrup of the baklava and the ice cream, cleansing your\npalate before you have another bite.\nUponarrival,wenoticedthattherestaurantwasvery\nbusy, granted it was a friday night.

Before I launch into\nmy critique of the night, I\u2019d like to say I\u2019m happy this\nopportunity didn\u2019t materialise \u2013 most performances\nhere would have given me some sort of complex. I\nalready have my degree for that.\nI was tempted to write this article from the\nperspective of the new Gig Manager for Live Music\nSociety, but I know I\u2019ll get yelled at once this makes it\nto the paper. Suffice to say, my arrival was greeted with\nhis anxious face peering through a cheerful crowd\nwithin the Union Bar, because guess what: we\u2019re over\ncapacity by 15 people.\nA guitarist on a stool is serenading the audience\nwith his husky, yet slightly off-tune voice. Behind the\nwindow that separates the mini-foyer and the mini-stage, I am making my second case to this security\nguard \u2013 I\u2019m reporting for the newspaper, I have to\nbe here. My first case was that I\nam, indeed, a student at Imperial\ndespite having forgotten to carry\nmy student ID. Please look at my\n\u201cImperial College London on\nYammer\u201d emails. I have plenty.\nAfter these negotiations, I make\nit to the inside of the bar where\nI see my friend from across the\nroom.

Not only does he come with\na cinematic backing track, he brings with him a fan\nwho makes a snappy appearance every time he slips\ninto operatic falsetto. Later, he accidentally leaves this\nfan behind and his biggest fan holds it like it\u2019s a glass\nslipper.\nWhilst the new Gig Manager\nwaddles around looking worried\nand my friend puts his weight on\nthe bar table \u2013 \u201cwait, what was that\nsound?\u201d \u2013 the stage opens to some\nmagnificent and some mediocre\nguitar and vocal acts. I remember\nlooking at my guilty-faced friend\nand telling him that this girl\u2019s\nskilled breath control reminded me\nof Dolores O\u2019Riordan\u2019s yodel-like\nsinging (that\u2019s the lead singer of the\nCranberries, for the uncultured). A subsequent cover\nof \u201cZombie\u201d reminded me that O\u2019Riordan\u2019s singing is\nheld in such high regard for a reason \u2013 it\u2019s very hard to\nreplicate.\nAs more people begin to leave than enter, we\nwatch an original song dedicated to a member of the\naudienceasabirthdaypresent.Itisactuallyquiteheart-warming to watch, even if the music isn\u2019t to my taste.\nAs the innocently-worded song about never giving up\nprogresses, the singer\u2019s voice gets surer and her smile\nwider. At some point, she even removes the hand mic\nfrom the stand. There is something appreciably teenage\n-Disney about that.\nSome notable vocalists include the singer from a\npair performing Rihanna\u2019s \u201cStay\u201d.

    "content": "Before we begin with this week\u2019s restaurant, I want\nto tell you a brief history behind the word \u2018Kebab\u2019\nas I think you get to appreciate the food much more\nwhen you know a bit more about it. The word \u2018Kebab\u2019\ncame into the English language in the late 17th century\nfrom the Arabic word \u2018kab\u0101b\u2019 which means \u2018to roast\u2019\nand it first appears in Turkish texts as early as the 14th\ncentury, in Kyssa-i Yusuf (the story of Joseph). The\ndish itself is quite self explanatory and could be said\nthat it is something we have been eating since man first\ndiscovered fire, as kebab in its simplest form is meat on\nskewers.Theoldestfoundevidenceofkebabsbeingeat-en is from ancient Greek settlements where they found\nstone support for skewers used before the 17th century\nBC.\nNamed after the \u2018handfuls of brightly coloured,\ntoasted rice eaten at funfairs in Persia\u2019, Berenjak is located in the heart of Soho (a short half hour journey\nfrom Imperial), serving traditional Persian dishes.\nTheir dishes range from different mazehs, sofreh dish-es, kababs (which are all meant for sharing between 2\npeople) and drinks, making it a great way to get into\nmiddle eastern cuisine.\nTo start us off we began with the mazehs, which\nare a selection of hot and cold appetisers eaten in and\naround the Middle East. We ordered \u2018Hummus\u2019, \u2018Mast\nO Musir\u2019 and \u2018Mirza Ghasemi\u2019. Which was paired with\ntwotypesofbread,\u2018Taftoon\u2019and\u2018Sangak\u2019.Thehummus\nserved at Berenjak is made from black chickpeas and\ngenerous amounts of tahini which you wouldn\u2019t find\nin your typical hummus, making it more smoother in\ntexture. In terms of flavour the hummus was delicious\nand savory due to the black chickpeas giving more\ncomplexity to the dish and it made my friend say it was\nthe best hummus he had ever had which hopefully tells\nyou how good it was. Personally I\u2019m not the biggest fan\nof hummus, but I really did enjoy the hummus here,\nwhich was something the waiters recommended we\nshould have.\nThe Mast O Musir is a traditional yoghurt dish that\nincludes goat curds, Persian shallots and cold pressed\nrapeseed oil. The dish is there to compliment the\nkebabs you get, but it alone can be eaten in one go with\nthe toasted yet soft breads (Taftoon and Sangak) we\nordered. The yoghurt was very creamy and delightfully\nsmooth, with a slight sweet note due to the goat curds\nand had a mouth watering garlicky taste caused by the\nshallots. Personally I found this to be the best side dish\nonthetableandreallycouldn\u2019tstopmyselffromhaving\nit.\nFinally, the last mazeh was Mirza Ghasemi which is\ndistinct to Northern Iran and the Caspian Sea region,\nconsisting of mashed coal aubergines, tomato, garlic\nand egg, Mirza Ghasemi is known as a dip dish, making\nit perfect to eat with the breads we ordered. The dish\nitself was nicely seasoned and easy to chew, it had a\npaste-liketextureandalthoughnotthefavouritemazeh\nout of the three we ordered, it was still very nice to eat.\nI felt like the Mirza Ghasemi was too charred for my\nliking, which personally I found to have overpowered\nthe other flavours in the dip.\nNow onto the main meal, for a table of four we\nordered three different kebabs that came in one\ngigantic plate, with grilled tomatoes, peppers and raw\nonions on the side. The kebabs were nicely plated over\nsoft flatbread which soaked up all the delicious fats and\nflavoursfromthekebabs.Onethingtonoteisthateach\nkebab you order comes in one skewer, so I would advise\nyou to order two or three kebabs depending on your\nappetite or the number of people you\u2019re with. In our\ncase, we ordered \u2018Jujeh Kabab\u2019, \u2018Koobideh Kabab\u2019 and\nFRIDAY 3RD DECEMBER 2021\n35\nFood.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nBerenjak - modern and colourful\nPerisan food right at your door step\nRestaurant Review\nReviewed by Bencan Yalcin Food Editor\nPricerange: \u00a3\u00a3\u00a3\nSignaturedishes: Hummus&JujehKabab\nStyle: Casual\nEdited by: Zahra Abiola\nBencan Yalcin\nFood\nPhoto credits: Bencan Yalcin\nSizzling Kababs served with charcoaled tomatoes and peppers and raw onions, tucked above a flat bread that\u2019s soaking up all the wonderful flavours of the meats\nPhoto credits: Bencan Yalcin\nFresh mazehs - the two in the middle are the hummus, the\nyogurt dip is the one furthest away and the aubergine based dip\nis the one closest to the image\n\n"

I have experienced it myself (albeit to a\nlesser degree than an older person might have) as I am designated \u2018clinically extremely vulnerable\u2019\ndue to a chronic health condition that requires me to take immunosuppressants.\nMask mandates make sense and should have been introduced again as soon as deaths began to\nclimb in July.\nDespite this, I cannot see an argument for universities having a higher level of restriction than\nthe rest of society. A university is filled mainly with young people who clearly are at much less\nthreat from COVID than the average member of society. Furthermore, unlike at school, where this\npopulation of young people are living with their elderly relatives, university students are generally\nliving and socialising with other young people and are much less likely to act as a hotbed of the\nillness which will then spread to other sections of the population. If our secondary schools can\nremain fully open without masks, surely our universities can return to normal with them. If I can go\nclubbing in a poorly-ventilated underground hotbox, why can\u2019t I attend a large lecture theatre while\nwearing a mask?\nI do, however, understand that lecturers are generally more at risk from the virus than students.\nAnd therefore, I would propose it is reasonable and right for any lecturers who feel particularly\nvulnerable from the illness to conduct their courses entirely online without any pressure to do\notherwise. But I think the norm should most certainly be that lectures are conducted in person\nFrom value for money to mental health provisions I believe it is irresponsible for this university\nto conduct so much of its teaching online. If Imperial is to maintain its reputation as one of the top\nuniversities in the country, it should look at what the others are doing. For example, Cambridge has\nbeen delivering lectures in person where possible since March, and my friends at Oxford report the\nsame situation.\nI hope my comments are received in the constructive way they are meant.\nRegards,\nCameron Stibbard Hawkes First Year Biochemistry\nAlettertoourleadersonCovidrestrictions\nLetters have been edited\nCOMIC\n\n"

    "content": "This week, pensions are big news. A\nstrike from the University and College\nUnion (UCU) aims to defend the university pension fund (USS) from savage cuts , and argues that staff shouldn\u2019t\nhave to pay more contributions towards\na smaller pension in return. The National Unions of Students (NUS) is backing\nthe strike to protect the future work of\nstudents in academia and because our\nlearning depends on staff being valued\nby their institutions. I support the strike\nfor fairer pensions that value academics,\nbut we cannot ignore the elephant in the\nroom: are pensions even going to exist as\nthe climate and ecological systems break\ndown?\nPensions are worth protecting, as they\nhelp to provide a more comfortable and\nsecure future. But the climate and ecological emergency threatens our comfortable and secure future and needs to\nbe a focus in the pensions argument. A\n2020 case study from the Institute and\nFaculty of Actuaries, which focuses on\npensions, stated \u2018the potential influence\nand risk of climate change on economies\nand our financial system is no longer in\ndoubt\u2019. They refer to tipping points such\nas climate change-related migration and\nconflicts, and the potential for food or\nother resource shortages causing \u2018a drag\non investment returns\u2019. The fight for a\nsecure pension clearly takes a back seat\nto mass migrations, food shortages, and\nwars,butthisshowshowinterconnected\nthe issues are.\nNot only that, but current pensions\nare invested in fossil fuels, which directly threaten our futures through climate\nand ecological collapse. We must demand sustainable investments in pen-sions, otherwise people under 45 may\nwell never see it. Nobody wants a pension that is at the expense of a habitable planet. The Divest USS campaign is\nworth looking into for more details on\nhow current pensions have signed a pact\nwith destructive industries, at: divestuss.\norg.\nI also welcome the collaboration between the students and the staff, as cooperation between groups and unions\nis key before taking on larger battles,\nsuch as tackling fossil fuel investments\nby Imperial College. Working together\nis important for creating change, and at\na greater societal level, greater injustices\ncan be challenged.\nIn 40 years, when I retire, many things\nwill have happened. Almost certainly\nanother pandemic, but we still have our\nhands on the wheel to decide how other\nthings go. I would like to live in a world\nwhere Black Friday has been replaced\nwith Payback Friday, where we celebrate\nfair reparations to countries who have\nsuffered centuries of colonialism and climate change. Where Christmas is a festival of love for community rather than\nlove for consumption. Where we tell\nstories about the day when no new fossil\nfuel extraction was globally announced.\nI\u2019d like to live in a world where we don\u2019t\nneed private pensions, because a state\npension provides enough for a dignified\nretirement. But to get there, we need to\nstart forcing that change now, through\ncollaborations that are focussed on\nproviding a safe and secure future for\neveryone. Rather than wait for the next\ninternational catastrophe, let\u2019s be proactive about it and join activist groups who\nfight for the changes we need.\nLet\u2019s act now. Our civilisation depends upon it.\nThere are no pensions\non a dead planet\nResearch Postgraduate Peter Knapp reasons that we cannot plan for a future that is not guaranteed.\nPeterKnapp\nCommentContributor\nKEEP THE CAT FREE\n38 Comment.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nEdited by: Khama Gunde\nComment Have an article in mind?\nEmail your idea or piece to:\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nPhoto credits: Markus Spiske on Pexels\n\n"

That is the slogan of Dear Future\nChildren and it fits this documentary about the life of\nthree young female activists - all in their early 20s.\nIn Chile, Rayen is protesting against socioeconomic\ninequalities and government corruption. While Chile\nis quite stable economically as a country, it does not\nbenefit all the population as it has one of the worst\nrates of inequality in Latin America. In 2019, students\nlet their anger explode when the government of\nSebasti\u00e1n Pi\u00f1era increased the subway fares. The police\nresponded with brutality and since then the country\nhas been at war with its own citizens. Chileans now\nmarch for fewer inequalities, better justice, education,\nhealthcare and a lot of them want Sebasti\u00e1n Pi\u00f1era to\nresign. We follow Rayen speaking about her reasons for\nfighting and see the reality of living amidst this chaos.\nIn Uganda, Hilda is fighting to raise awareness\nabout climate change. She had her village completely\ndrowned, causing many casualties and forcing families\nto move and lose their crops. Indeed, climate change\nhas impacted the rainfall patterns of Uganda resulting\nin massive floods in some parts of the country. After\nlosing her village, Hilda realized caring for the\nenvironment was important since it had direct effects\non her, and how little her country was committed to\nteach this. She decided to take the matter into her\nown hands and we can see her cleaning rivers of plastic\nbottles. She is an activist at the local Fridays for Future\nprotests and actions for climate justice and got invited\nto a climate summit in Denmark to talk about the\nsituation in Uganda.\nIn Hong Kong, Pepper is fighting for the \u00ab Five\ndemands, not one less \u00bb among the pro-democracy\nprotests. These 5 demands are : 1) The withdrawal of\nthe China\u2019s Extradition Bill, 2) the retractation of the\nprotests as \u201criots\u2019\u2019, 3) an independent investigation into\nuse of force by police, 4) the unconditional release of\neveryonearrestedinthecontextofprotests,5)political\nreform to ensure genuine universal suffrage \u2013 the\nability to choose Hong Kong\u2019s leaders themselves \u2013 as\nset under the city\u2019s mini-Constitution, the Basic Law.\nAt the end of the documentary, we learn that Pepper\nhas fled Hong Kong and is now a political refugee.\nIn the ending credits, the only team that was not\nexplicitly credited was the Hong Kong one because\nthey could be put under arrest for participating in the\nmovie.\nOverall, the documentary focuses on activism itself\nrather than its results. Indeed, Pepper and Rayen\u2019s\nstories are just a small screenshot of the situation in\ntheir respective countries without any noticeable\nchanges between the beginning and the end of the\nmovie. The system they are fighting against is not even\naware of who they are. It is clear that the purpose of\nthese two narratives are to raise awareness about the\nsituation in these twp countries and to persuade more\npeople to join the fight. As for Hilda, it is a little bit\ndifferent since you can see that her actions have some\ndirect impact in her community in Uganda. She does\nnot fight a \u00ab system \u00bb like the two other activists,\nshe fights against bad habits and for environmental\neducation. While she obviously faces a lot of hardships,\nher narrative is still the one that gives the most hope.\nIt is important to note that it is not a documentary\nontheinsandoutsofthepoliticalsituationofthethree\ncountries. Actually, it only briefly grazes the socio-economico-political of each country.\nI got the chance to be invited - thank you - to the\nscreeningofDearFutureChildrenattheFinsburyPark\nPicturehouse in London where the director and part\nof his crew was present. At the end of the screening,\nthey talked a bit about the project and it is clear that\nit is very important to them. It was mainly financed\nthrough crowdfunding campaign and practically all of\nthe crew is in their 20s. It is the feature film debut of\nthe director, Franz B\u00f6hm, and it has already received\nmultiple awards.\nNext time you want to hear about what young\npeople are fighting for across the world, remember\nDear Future Children!\nICU Cinema: Winter All-Nighter 21/22\nRebecca Vickery ICU Cinema Chair\nIt has returned! After a two year break, Imperial\nCinema\u2019s legendary All-Nighter is back with bang!\nSix films, back-to-back, from 6pm in the evening to\n8.30am the next day. You may wonder, \u201cHow does one\nsurvive such a test of stamina?\u201d\nWell, it just so happens that I have the tried and\ntested top tips for you. Coffee is your best friend, and\nin order to achieve confortable seating you\u2019re more\nthan welcome to bring your own pillows and blankets.\nTo celebrate the return of the All-Nighter, we\nthought we would give you one of our best line-ups to\ndate\u2026\nNo Time To Die (18:00)\nWith the release of the latest film in the James Bond\nfranchise being postponed from November 2019, it\u2019s\none that is definitely worth the wait. Daniel Craig\nonce again playing the title character with a great cast\nincluding Rami Malek, Lashana Lynch, and Ana de\nArmas. The classic is certainly far from monotonous.\nDune (21:30)\nFor those of you searching for your next slice of Sci-Fi,\nlook no further than Dune. It tells the story of a dangerous conflict over a planet\u2019s most precious resources,\nwith a brilliant young man (Timothee Chalamet),\nborn to lead a cause he doesn\u2019t fully believe in.\nVenom: Let There be Carnage (00:00)\nTom Hardy is back as Eddie Brock, the young man\nstruggling to coexist with his shape-shifting extra-ter-restrial body cohabitant, Venom. This is not your\naverage Marvel superhero film but instead follows a\nmore DC, dark approach to the genre.\nLast night in Soho (02:00)\nAnya Taylor-Joy, my favourite international Chess\nchampion, takes on a very different role in Last Night\nin Soho. Edgar Wright directing this psychological\nthriller has truly created a mind-twisting masterpiece\nwith this one.\nSpencer (04:30)\nSpencer is the film that I am most excited about.\nWhile some of you may take this film to catch some\nquick shut-eye, that would be a mistake. Kristen Stewart (satisfying all my fantasies) is taking on the role of\nPrincess Diana in this biopic looking at the HRH\u2019s\nexit from the Royal Family in the 90s. It has the nostalgic wardrobe, the stunning cast also including Jack\nFarthing, Timothy Spall, and just is a truly stunning\nfeature.\nThe French Dispatch (06:30)\nOur final film for the night is \u201ca love letter to journalists\u201d directed by Wes Anderson who also brought us\nThe Grand Budapest Hotel, Fantastic Mr. Fox, and\nmany more. The entire cast is made up of A-Listers\nincluding Tilda Swinton, Bill Murray, Owen Wilson,\nthe list goes on\u2026\nEnjoy the sound of these? Then make sure to book\nyour tickets for the All-Nighter which is on Tuesday\n14th December in the Union Concert Hall. Tickets\ncan be bought online for the whole event (\u00a312) or on\nthe door for individual films (subject to capacity), and\nlet\u2019s not forget the all-you-can-eat hot food and drinks\nfor just an extra \u00a35.\n\n"

Back in 2019, it was\nthe first major London revival of playwright Terrence\nRattigan\u2019s comedic hit. Playing over 1000 performances in the West End when it premiered at the Globe in\n1943, it was Rattigan\u2019s biggest commercial success, but\nseldom seen on such a scale since.\nThe plot revolves around the young Earl of\nHarpenden, or Bobby to his friends, and his impending marriage to the na\u00efve but sweet Lady Elisabeth.\nOn the eve of his wedding, chaotic circumstances\nbring several unforeseen visitors into his apartment\n\u2013 notably, a brash American bombardier and French\nlieutenant. Hilarity ensures as identities get confused\nand both guests accidentally set their sights on Bobby\u2019s\nfianc\u00e9. To complicate matters further, his butler consistently flits in and out, and Bobby\u2019s ex-flame Mabel\nCrum, as well as his future father-in-law turn up to the\napartment, creating a middle act brimming with laugh-ter, life, and silliness.\nIt is wonderfully played, with seven flawless cast\nmembers, great chemistry, and no weak links. Philip\nLabey plays a charming version of Bobby, countered\nby the brashness of Conor Glean as the American and\nJordan Mifs\u00fad\u2019s explosive Frenchman. For me, a special mention goes to Sophie Khan Levy playing the\nbrilliant Mabel Crum, who really brings the writing\nof her character to life. Mabel Crum feels ahead of her\ntime \u2013 a self-proclaimed \u201ctrollop\u201d, she says, \u201cI do it for\nthe men, not the money\u201d, owning her existence as an\nsmart, independent woman who revels in her freedom\nand doesn\u2019t feel the pressure to be married to a man.\nDirector Paul Miller masters the circular staging,\nwith the actors\u2019 mid-speech movements feeling natural\nwithout any audience member ever having to look at\nthe back of an actor\u2019s head for too long. Simon Daw\u2019s\nset design creates the right sense of grandeur for an\nEarl\u2019s London apartment, without making the space\nfeel cluttered, and works wonderfully in tandem with\nElizabeth Purcell\u2019s sound design, weaving in with light\nclassical music of the time.\nI found myself unexpectedly enjoying the witty banter and entertaining back and forth between charac-ters, despite the fact it isn\u2019t my usual sort of humour. If\nyou fancy a light-hearted night out in the lovely setting\nof Richmond\u2019s Orange Tree Threatre, I recommend\ngiving this one a go.\nThe sun is shining in Richmond for Rattigan\u2019s Revival\nReviewed by Shivani Gangadia Arts Writer\nWhile the Sun Shines\nWhere?

    "content": "KEEP THE CAT FREE\nScience.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\n6\nCOVID-19 has plagued our lives for\nalmost two years now, however,\nvarying CoV strains have been around\nfor much longer. In 2015, South Korea\nsaw an outbreak of MERS-CoV, and\nthe UK came worryingly close to its\nown outbreak when three people presented with flu-like symptoms ten days\nafter travelling to an undisclosed loca-tion. They were admitted to hospital\nand within a week were lab-confirmed\ncases of MERS-CoV. After initiating\ncontact tracing, it was discovered that\ntwo of these individuals had attended a\nlarge gathering shortly before falling ill;\nfast-forward a few weeks and the UK\nhad 50 confirmed cases and 650 con-tacts. The NHS was under pressure, particularly due to the usual flu cases, and\nthe media took a keen interest in the potential of a widespread outbreak.\nThankfully, the MERS-CoV outbreak\nwas contained. However, in response,\nthe then Chief Medical Officer (Dame\nSally Davies) requested an exercise (Ex-ercise Alice) involving NHS England,\nPublic Health England, and the Department of Health. Observers were also invited from GO-Science and the Cabinet\nOffice. The tabletop exercise, lasting one\nday, involved a discussion and investigation into the nation\u2019s preparedness for\na potential pandemic. The four themes\nto be investigated were PPE, Use of\nQuarantine, Community Sampling, and\nCommunication.\nThe Clinical Advisory Group concluded that the Government and NHS\nwere ill-prepared for a pandemic and\nidentified 12 action points that were\nconsidered essential to being able to\nhandle any outbreaks. These 12 action\npoints, listed on the right, highlight\nwith alarming precision most of what\nwe failed to do well enough (or rapidly\nenough) during the pandemic. Significantly, this report was published 4 years\nbefore COVID-19 appeared on the\nscene\u2013yet it was not acted upon and\nwas kept undisclosed to the public for\nfive years. Sections of the Government\nwere possibly unaware of this report\nwith Matt Hancock being quoted say-ing, \u201cFamously, all the preparations and\nthe plans that were in place were for a flu\npandemic.\u201d Was he knowingly covering\nup an exercise looking at the need of a\nplan for a CoV pandemic, or was the\nreport so tightly confined to those directly involved, that not even our former\nHealth Secretary was aware of it? Regardless, the action points identified by\nthe Clinical Advisory Group were not\nacted upon, a plan was not devised, and\nso when SARS COVID-19 hit we were\ncaught off-guard and unprepared.\nA few months into the pandemic in\nApril 2020, a clinical consultant, Dr\nMoosa Qureshi, led a campaign for\ntransparency into NHS preparedness\nfor a pandemic, demanding the release\nof a report on a three-day simulation exercisefrom2016,entitled\u201cExerciseCygnus\u201d. After initial hesitations, the report\nwas released, but was considered unsatisfactory in addressing these concerns.\nSubsequently, after more than a year of\ncampaigning, \u201cExercise Alice\u201d, along\nwith 6 other reports, were released. All\nthese reports highlighted the need of the\ngovernment to prepare for any potential\npandemics. Yet what was their response?\nThe government and NHS have yet to\npresent evidence or record of them addressing these action points prior to the\nCOVID-19 outbreak.\nThe question on Dr Qureshi and\neveryone else\u2019s minds is why? Why\nthe lack of action? Why the failure to\ndisclose? Where is the Government\u2019s\ntransparency? There is also the question\nof who in the Government was aware\nof this? The Health Secretary (Jeremy\nHunt at the time) is known to have overseen Exercise Alice, but who else was\naware? Who bears responsibility for the\napparent negligence, and what will be\ndone to prevent such a situation occurring in the future?\nThe Government have launched their\nown inquiry into their handling of the\nCOVID-19 pandemic, however, it is\nnot due to open until spring 2022, so for\nnow it remains a continued campaign\nfor transparency and a patient wait for\nthe inquiry and its results.\nAllanah Hibbert Science Writer\nPandemic preparedness: UK government\nignored exercise action points\nEdited by: Isabelle Zhang\nJamie John\nCara Burke\nMarek Cottingham\nScience\nThe Clinical Advisory Group\u2019s 12 action points\n1.

I\nreally enjoyed a lot of the music nominated from\nthe release period of September\n1st 2020 to September 30th 2021.\nThe nominations mirror the top-streamed artists, albums, and\nsongs of 2021, and so appear to be\nrepresentative of global listening\ntrends, and logical.\nTake Olivia Rodrigo, for\nexample. The 18-year-old artist has\nseven Grammy nominations this\nyear, including in all four major\ncategories, which is logical: she\nblew up on TikTok, had three Top-10 singles, and a\nfive week run at No. 1. Lil Nas X, Billie Eilish, Taylor\nSwift and Doja Cat, all who dominated music in 2021,\nsimilarly have an impressive number of nominations.\nInequalities within the Grammys have also shown\nimprovement this year. The gender imbalance within\nnominees has increased from only 9% female in 2018,\nto being gender-equal, if not dominated by women,\nacross all major categories in the nominations for the\n2022 awards. So why am I being so critical?\nWith exciting new music being released every day,\nand innovative new artists springing up across the\nworld all the time, it is disheartening to watch the\nawards show industry continue to\ncelebrate the same artists year after\nyear. Even the new artist categories\ncelebrate acts who have been around\nfor years - Glass Animals, who are\nnominated for Best New Artist, have\nbeen around for 11 years and have 3\nstudioalbumsundertheirbelt,oneof\nwhich was nominated for a Mercury\nAward. That isn\u2019t how I would define\namusicalunderdog.Othercategories\nleave a stale taste in my mouth with\nthe lack of fresh artists, with Justin Bieber, Ed Sheeran,\nACDC, Foo Fighters, and Coldplay all nominated.\nMaybe I\u2019m just a pretentious music editor.

With\nrestrictions lifted and demand rising,\nthe decision was made to restart the\nNight Tube from the last weekend\nof November (26th and 27th).\nWhen the Night Tube was first\nlaunched, it was staffed by employees\nassigned exclusively to work on the\novernight services. With the suspension\noftheNightTubeduetothecoronavirus\npandemic, these workers were folded\ninto the larger pool in order to provide\nenough staff for the operation of\nregular services. With the resumption\nof the Night Tube, TfL plans to keep\nthis singular pool of drivers, asking\neach to work a few nights each year.\nBoth parties were unable to come to\nan agreement despite moderation by the\narbitration service, ACAS. As a result,\nthe first round of walkouts occurred on\nFriday26thNovember,withthemajority\nof drivers on the Piccadilly, Victoria,\nNorthern, Central, Waterloo & City\nand Jubilee lines walking out at the start\nof service at 04:30.

What I liked was that you could link this\nvery cerebral, maths-driven way of writing things down\nto the things that are happening around you. I liked\nfiddling about with that quite a\nlot. It helped me to understand\nwhat was going on.\u201d\nThis attraction to hands-on work in service of a larger,\nabstract concept stayed with\nher. \u201cThere is something very\nsatisfying about film production\nthat\u2019s quite technical, and quite\ncreative, and that actually felt\nlike the right fit in the end. I like\nthe variety of the production\nexperience\u2026\n\u201cIf you\u2019re working in\ndocumentary \u2013 I mean a lot\nof the time, no \u2013 but for me,\nwhat I like is filming people observationally, which is:\nsomebody\u2019sactuallydoingsomethingatthisactualtime,\nand they\u2019re having a reaction about something in this\nmoment, right? And if you\u2019re there, it\u2019s incredible, it\u2019s\nreally exciting - you\u2019re like oh, what\u2019s going to happen?\nYou could argue, kind of similarly, that if you\u2019re doing\nan experiment, you\u2019re in that process, you\u2019re observing\nin that way.\u201d\nDespite being a science-educated, technical-minded\nfilmmaker, Elena doesn\u2019t make analytical, fact-driven\ndocumentaries. \u201cI worked on a few things that were\na little bit engineering-based, I worked on a thing\nabout the Nobel prize. But honestly, I found it really\nunsatisfying, and it\u2019s not my bag.\nI don\u2019t find those kinds of dry,\nfactual things, for me \u2013 I love\nthat someone has the enthusiasm\nand the wherewithal to make\nthem, because I do think they\u2019re\nreally important. You know, I\nhave kids. One day, I\u2019d like for\nthem to watch some really great\nscience programming - that I\ndidn\u2019t make.\u201d\nEven if she did make a\nscientific documentary, it would\nbe focused more on the humans\nsurrounding the science than\nthe science itself. She references\nWerner Herzog\u2019s 2016 documentary Into the Inferno:\n\u201cIt\u2019s absolutely nuts. It\u2019s about volcanoes, when they\nerupt, and why they fascinate humans. So yes, there are\ninterviews with volcanologists and this and that and\nblah blah blah. But it\u2019s really more about how we relate\nto that experience in our world \u2013 it\u2019s all a bit mystical.\nI\u2019m drawn to that naturally, whether I like it or not.\u201d\nAlthough she\u2019s not about to make a miniseries\nexplaining physics to the masses, Elena believes in the\nimportance of science communication. The public,\nespecially since the pandemic, are more literate in some\npockets of science than ever before.\n\u201cThere have been loads more scientists, and science\npieces, in mainstream media. It\u2019s medical science, sure,\nbut it touched a lot on scientific methods. People are\nrelatively well educated on certain swathes of science\nnow, which is awesome. But also, the humans that\nrepresent that knowledge and are involved in that,\nmaybe they\u2019ve changed a bit. You might, in the past,\nexpect some sort of quack to come on and say: Yes,\nOK, everybody, we\u2019re doing this lockdown because\nx y and z \u2013 thanks, see you never.

    "content": "On Sunday the 21st of November,\nthe Imperial Archery Club hosted\nthe first competition of this academic\nyear. Held at the Ethos Sports Centre,\nthis competition was the first leg in a\nseries of five of the South East University Archery League (SEAL). For this\nfirst match, eight of our Imperial archers \u2013 four experienced and four\nnovice \u2013 went up\nagainst eight rival archers from\nthe University of\nSouthampton. The\nsixteen archers \u2013\nall of whom were\nrecurve archers\n\u2013 competed in a\nPortsmouth round\nto shoot for pride,\nglory and, perhaps\nfrom a more utilitarian point of\nview,ahigherscore\non the leaderboard. In a Portsmouth\nround, our archers had to shoot at a 60\ncm wide target 20 yards away. What\nmay already sound daunting to some is\ncompounded by the fact that they had to\nshoot 20 ends of three arrows, totalling\n60 arrows, in just two hours. Still, both\nteams of well-prepared athletes took on\nthe challenge unfazed and performed\nwith flying colours. The archers all arrived by 4:30 pm to set up their equipment and prepare themselves mentally\nfor the match ahead. After two ends of\nsighters \u2013 a crucial period for the archers\nto make final adjustments \u2013 the competition officially started at 5:45 pm. After\nthe line, the judge sounded the whistle,\nthe archers stepped onto the shooting\nline, nocked their arrows, raised their\nbows, drew, anchored and aimed. Then,\none by one, the archers let lose their arrows and the sound of arrows piercing\ntheir target echoed through the\nhall. Our Imperial\narchers went off\nwith a great start,\nwith arrow after\narrow landing in\nthe gold. The archers from Southampton did not\nfalter either, giving\nImperial archers\na fierce compe-tition. However,\nthere were multiple ends still to\ngo, and anything\ncould have happened considering the\nmentalandphysicalexhaustionthearch-ers would inevitably experience. Yet, the\nskilled Imperial archers, perhaps spurred\non by the competitors\u2019 impressive show-ing,orperhapsactingindefianceoftheir\nfatigue, only seemed to improve, with\nsenior archer Tristan Lim even hitting\nthree10sinasingleend\u2013aperfectscore!\nThis is not to say the non-stop shooting\nwas not physically taxing, however. Vice\nCaptain Harrison Moss had to change\nthe limbs of his bow in the middle of\nthe competition since his arms were getting fatigued. His foresight in bringing\ntwo sets of limbs allowed him to maintain\nhis performance, which\nultimately netted him\nthe third highest score\nthat day. Still, the archers soldiered on, and\nafter two hours, twenty\nends and five dozen ar-rows, the competition\nfinally drew to a close.\nWhile the archers finally had a moment for a\nbreather, the judges continued to work\ntirelessly to check, confirm and calculate\neach archer\u2019s score. After a night of hard\nwork, the results of the first leg of SEAL\nwere finally out. Our Imperial archers\ndeliveredaremarkableperformance.The\nfour senior archers achieved a total score\nof 1983 points, placing Imperial solidly in second place of the senior league,\nbehind East Anglia, while the athletes\nfrom Southampton placed eighth in the\nsenior league, ahead of Essex. Imperial\u2019s\nnovice archers made a similarly impressive achievement. The top three novice\narchers of Imperial scored a combined\ntotal of 1050, landing the team at third\nplace in the novice league, just ahead of\nour competitors, Southampton, who got\nfourth with 1015 points. This competition not only served to\nhelp the senior archers\nacclimatise after a sever-al-month gap between\ncompetitions, but it also\nprovided an invaluable\nopportunity for the novice archers to experience\nthe atmosphere and ten-sionofanarcherycompe-tition. With our archers\nnow more experienced\nthan ever, we have great\nconfidence that they will continue to\ntriumph in future competitions, which\nloom ever closer. Two more matches will\nbe held on the first weeks of December.\nThis time, the Archery Team\u2019s com-pound, barebow and longbow archers\nwill also get their opportunity to shine.\nWe wish the Imperial archers all the best\nin the competitions to come.

If not for him, we would not\nhave the tour de force of culture that is BBC Three, and\nalloftheiconicshowsitproducedsinceitsinceptionin\n2003.StuartalsobroughtthebestofUSentertainment\nover the pond by helming the creation of Sky Atlantic,\nthe home of HBO in the UK. Today, he is the CEO\nof the English National Opera where he is spearheading a campaign to make opera accessible for everyone.\nStuart has introduced a number of schemes targeted\nat introducing younger audiences to opera. The ENO\noffer discounted tickets for under-35s, free tickets for\nunder-21s, and ENO Response, a mentoring scheme\nfor young opera critics.\nWe began chronologically with Stuart\u2019s time at BBC\nThree. In its heyday, BBC Three was the angsty younger sibling to the rest of the BBC channels.\n\u201cIt stood up to the establishment. It had\na very liberal outlook.\u201d\nStuart gave young creatives free reign to explore\nthemes that reflected their experience and interests.\nThis resulted in everything from bleak satires like 15\nStories High and Money Dust to beloved sitcom classics like Gavin and Stacy, all of which were able to tap\ninto the cultural zeitgeist. Monkey Dust is probably the\ndarkest show the BBC has ever produced, regularly\nfeaturing sketches about paedophiles, terrorists, and\neverything in between.\nBut did BBC Three go too far? What happens when\nwe look back at \u201cedgy\u201d comedy and deem it offen-sive? Little Britain has been the subject of controversy surrounding its use of blackface and transphobic\nelements. Episodes containing offensive content have\nbeen removed from streaming services, as have all traces of Monkey Dust. Today only clips of it survive on\nYouTube.\n\u201cContext is key \u2013 so long as audiences\nare warned. Framing. Prepped for it\u2026\nSomeone told me that I crossed the line.\nBut who put the line there? You did.\u201d\nBBC Three was a space for people to explore risqu\u00e9\ncomedy. Audiences watched Little Britain expecting\nNSFW comedy; it is that context that is often left out\nthe conversation when discussing offensive content of\nthe past. But the boundary-pushing comedy that became part of BBC Three\u2019s identity allowed it to push\nother boundaries. There is a reason why BBC Three\nis the home of RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race, a show that would\nhave been unlikely to have been aired on any mainstream channels fifteen years ago.\n\u201cBut there is a difference when things\nare live. It can sting harder.\u201d\nWe move to discussing opera. Many classic operas\nare being re-evaluated through the lens of contemporary morality: Madam Butterfly has raised discussions\nabout Orientalism and cultural appropriation. The\nethical status of Wagner\u2019s operas has been frequently\ndiscussed in relation to the composer\u2019s virulent Anti-Semitism. There are many others examples to choose\nfrom.\n\u201cIt is only now that we are having these\nconversations. Until three years ago, opera had been a sealed art form.\u201d\nStuart credits the #MeToo movement and the death\nof George Floyd for kickstarting conversations about\npower and hegemony within opera. He also spoke\nabout the importance of gatekeepers, arbiters of the art\nwho had been responsible for keeping opera an exclusive space, inaccessible for many.\n\u201cWomen are usually murdered and\nraped. It is usually the straight white men\nwho win. I don\u2019t want that.\u201d\nThis is why Stuart is keen to push opera to younger and more demographics. Diversifying who gets to\nengage in and speak in these cultural conversations is\ncrucial in ensuring that opera remains relevant as an art\nform. Opera must be able to speak to and for every-one, not just for purists. The ENO appointed Annilese\nMiskimmon as its first female artistic director in 2020.\nMore recently they premiered their \u201cTikTokopera\u201d to\ncoincide with the release of Tiger King Season 2 via\nTikTok.\n\u201cIt has 15 million views worldwide.\nProbably more than any production ever.\u201d\nThefutureofoperaisanexcitingonenowthatweare\nredefining what opera means and asking for who is opera for. Before the \u201cTikTokopera\u201d came \u201cDrive & Live\u201d,\na COVID-19 compliant drive through performance\nof La Boh\u00e8me and the \u201cVirtual Opera Project\u201d which\npremiered a digital performance of Ravel\u2019s L\u2019Enfant et\nles Sortil\u00e8ges on YouTube. The production has recently\nbeen nominated for the 2021 Royal Philharmonic Society Award in the Opera and Music Theatre category.\nSo what can opera offer young people today?\n\u201cOpera can offer audiences a different\nkind of experience: Something that is not\nan immediate hit, If you commit to it, it\nwillgetunderyourskinandleaveyouwith\na legacy that will stay with you for years.\u201d\nYou can follow Alexander Cohen on twitter at\n@CohenCritic.\nAlexander Cohen chats to Stuart Murphy, CEO of the\nEnglish National Opera\nInterview\nOn the set of The Valkyrie, the English National Opera\u2019s latest production.\nCredits: Photo/ Tristram Kenton\nInterview by Alexander Cohen Arts Writer\n\n"

    "content": "It is believed that the first animal appeared on Earth around 800 million\nyears ago according to DNA evidence,\nbut we could not see a great flourish of\ndifferent animal species until around\n530 million years ago with the Cambrian explosion. This period left us unique\nfossil records of enigmatic animals\nlike trilobites. After hundreds of years\nof evolution with massive extinction\nevents, four grand animal groups remain\nthe basal taxa and three superphyla. The\nbasal taxa have this name because these\nare the first animals to dwell on the\nEarth. In the basal taxa, four phyla are\nincluded in Porifera (sponges), Cnidarian (jellyfish and anemones), Placozoa\n(small and flat ciliated marine animals)\nand Ctenophora (comb jellies). On the\nother hand, regarding the three super-phyla, Deuterostomia are characterized\nby the formation of the anus before the\nmouth during embryonic development\nand some of their sea stars and humans\nbelong to this group. Ecdysozoa include\nnematodes, insects and crabs, which\nmoult their exoskeleton. Finally, Lophotrochozoa reference annelids and mol-luscs, so most of their components have\ngot a softbody. The key difference between the basal taxa and three superphy-la is that the syperphyla possess bilateral\nsymmetry, a milestone in the history of\nevolution because since then all the new\nanimals will possess this feature. Consequently, the three superphyla can also be\nclustered under the name Bilateria.\nThe issue here is that the order of apparition of the phyla of the basal taxa\nis obscure. They all possess primitive\ncharacteristics such as the absence of\nreal muscles or the use of simple diffusion to transport substances around the\nbody. In addition, all of them live in the\nocean, where life has emerged certainly\nfor the first time. However, traditional-ly, most scientists believed that sponges\nwere the first animals due to their sim-plicity. They lack germ layers, which\nare the first coats of cells formed during\nembryonic development, which begin\ncell specialization. There are three types\nof germ layers: endoderm, mesoderm\nand ectoderm, which form the gut, the\nmuscles and the nervous system, respec-tively. Hence, sponges have got neither\nspecialized tissues nor organs. Sponges\nare sessile during most of their life cycle,\nwhich means they cannot move. Therefore, sponges were believed to be plants,\nbut we currently know they are animals\nbecause they are filterers, catching nutritive particles from the water using flagellated cells called choanocytes. Sponges\nalso have calcium carbonate skeletons\nwhich allowed the formation of very old\nfossils. Indeed, a 580-million-year-old\nfossil of a sponge\u2019s skeleton was found in\nthe Doushantuo Formation in Guizhou,\nChina. Arguably, this could be the oldest animal fossil in the world.\nTherefore, the idea that sponges were\nthe first animals seems logical and widely accepted until the 21st century with\nthe disruption of new techniques such\nas genome sequencing or advanced computational programmes. Research comparing the genome of different species of\ncomb jellies across the globe (including\nAntarctica) and the rest of animal taxa\nhas shown disturbing results: Ctenophora came before Porifera and Placozoa. In fact, all the dataset supports this\nhypothesis. The probability that Ctenophora were the first animals is around\n56.8 \u2013 75.4%, while the contrary case,\nthat Porifera were the first animals, has\ngot likelihood between 37.2 \u2013 43.2%.\nThe genomic comparison results seem\nillogic, far-fetched, so this was called\nthe Ctenophora problem. How can a\nsponge, asymmetrical and sessile, be\nmore advanced than ctenophores? Backing sponges, we currently know that that\nthey share more common genes with Bilaterians than ctenophores. The reason\nwhy sponges are, by far, so different to\ntheBilateriansisthatmanyoftheircom-plex genes are inhibited, not being able\nto express their codified traits. External\nappearances are treacherous in the field\nof evolutionary biology.\nBut what are ctenophores? They look\nlike transparent tiny sacs with bright\nmulticolour bands. Opposite to spong-es, these jellyfish-like animals possess\ngerm layers, so they have a nervous sys-tem, gut and muscles. Despite their\nharmless appearance, comb jellies are\ncarnivorous, capturing their prey with\nsticky cells called colloblasts.\nTherearetwomainschoolsofthought\nto explain the lack of specialized systems\nand in particular the nervous system, in\nPorifera and Placozoa. On the one hand,\nBilateria and Cnidaria share a similar\nnervous system that comes from a common ancestor- Ctenophores developed\ntheir own nervous system, independently from the bilaterian-cnidarian one.\nPorifera and Placozoa never had a nervous system. This model is the logical\none: complex traits like the nervous system appeared in more modern and complex organisms in a linear and gradual\nway. On the other hand, the disruptive\nmodel declares that the first animal already had a nervous system that evolved;\nresulting in the current nervous systems\nCnidaria, Placozoa and Bilateria have.\nPorifera and Placozoa lost their nervous\nand many other animal traits in a moment of time. This is more supported\nwith the mentioned evidence that Porifera have many of their genes inhibited.\nThe loss of animal features in Porifera\nand Placozoa are an example of adaptive\ninvolution, which is the simplification\nof the organism to adapt to a new environment or lifestyle. In a moment when\nmost organisms were increasing their\nmobility and lethality, sponges, instead\nofenteringthemainstreamcompetition,\nthey saw a niche available with less competition and decided to become filterers.\nIn this new niche, sponges do not need\nto move or react quickly to hunt prey,\nthey just filter whatever oceanic currents\nwere carrying on. Therefore, why should\nthey spend energy and nutrients in sen-sorial organs and nervous systems they\ndo not need? Is it not against natural selection and evolution maintaining useless traits? Sometimes, less is more.\nFRIDAY 3RD DECEMBER 2021\nSCIENCE\n7\nScience.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nWhat does the first animal look like?\nInvolution and the Ctenophora problem\nWang Guo Science Writer\nAplysina archeri (a species of Porifera)\nThe appearance of the first animal continues to be one of the most controversial discussions in evolutionary biology.\nPhoto credits: Wikimedia Commons - Nick Hobgood\nMnemiopsis leidyi (a species of Ctenophora)\nPhoto credits: Wikimedia - Bruno C.

    "content": "Die Walk\u00fcre (The Valkyrie) is the second drama\nfrom the four chronological texts that complete\nWagner\u2019s Ring of the Nibelung. It is, in a nutshell, an\n1850s musical version of the Lord of the Rings. With a\nmission to be different, the English National Opera is\ncurrently housing a modern interpretation of the text\nthat puts the spotlight firmly on the narrative and remarkable characterisation whilst remaining authentic\nand true to the source material. For those of you not\nfamiliar with opera\u2014or even daunted by the prospect\u2014The Valkyrie is an accessible and captivating first\nperformance to get out and go see!\nSince the events of Das Rheingold (the first text in\nthe Ring cycle), Wotan (Matthew Rose), the chief of\ngods, has fathered many bastard children to the chagrin of his wife Fricka (Susan Bickley). Of his children,\nthe nine daughters are the Valkyries. Wotan himself is\ndressed as a lumberjack and emits the air of of a man\nweighed down by his own shortcomings and circum-stances. His clear hubris is greed and, as this entangles\nhim in many troubles, he directs his illegitimate brood\nto help him clean up the mess of his own making. To\nthis end, he bestows upon them many talents, before\nultimately taking them away to his own bitter sorrow.\nAfter his son Siegmund (Nicky Spence) falls in love\nwith his twin sister, Fricka takes offense and demands\nthat they must be punished. In great agony, Wotan\ncommands Bruennhilde (Rachel Nicholls), his Valkyrie daughter, to kill the incestuous son. Bruennhilde is\ndecked out as a fashionable, neon, rebel, tomboy princess \u2014 fit to kill. However, despite being instructed\nto let her half-brother die, his pure bravery ultimately\nwins the warrior over to his side. As punishment for\nher betrayal of trust, Wotan strips from Bruennhilde\nher status as a Valkyrie and curses her to marry whichever man finds her first \u2014 the brave warrior will have\nto submit to a husband. Even worse, marry an inferior\nweakling.\nEmbodying an untainted heroic angel, Nicholls as\nBruennhilde was the clear standout of the evening.\nThere was a clarity and power behind her voice that\nsynergisedwiththeorchestrainawonderfulway.Once\neverysooften,thevoicesofthecastareoverpoweredby\nthe orchestra but all is forgiven when the sweet spot is\nreached. The four harps, placed on equal footing with\nthe stage, at times seem to extend the human voice.\nInitiallytheuseofmodernclothingratherthanareplica of the traditional costumes came as a disappoint-ment; however, it then dawned on me that contemporary outfits do not draw any attention, which created\nspace for a focus on the personalities and emotions of\nthe characters and, crucially, the story. Likewise, the\ndecor was contemporary, yet expertly supported the\nperformance. Befitting of a Wagner, no effort is spared\non providing a suitable d\u00e9cor \u2014 Wagner himself built\na custom theatre to perform the Ring cycle.\nThe Coliseum is packed with very enthusiastic op-eragoers. During intervals one hears the merry chatter\nof people who have missed this kind of entertainment\nwith kindred spirits. During the second interval, an\nAmerican voice behind me remarks, \u201cThis is actually\nenjoyable(!)\u201d. And I\u2019m inclined to agree with her: the\nduration may be daunting, but the opera is very acces-sible. It is entertaining like any other saga such as Star\nWars or Lord of the Rings. Like Wagner intended: it is\nenjoyable without any refined taste or clever critiques.\nCall me a Wagnerite!\nCall me a Wagnerite!\nReviewed by Nandi Schoots Arts Writer\nThe Valkyrie\nWhere?

    "content": "KEEP THE CAT FREE\nSCIENCE\nScience.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\n8\nOn October 28th, Facebook changed\ntheir name to Meta. This is apparently\ndue to the new vision that Mark Zuckerberg has for Facebook and his entire\ncompany. Facebook now controls 78\ncompanies through direct acquisition,\nthough of this, only 28 have been made\npublic, the most notable of which are\nWhatsApp and Instagram. The total value of the 28 which were acquired pub-licly, amounts to a sizeable 23 billion\nUS dollars. So where does the Metaverse\nfit into this? Well through these acqui-sitions, Facebook has accumulated a\nrather large number of companies in the\nvirtualrealitysector.Forexample,oneof\nthese companies is developing an emotion detector, while another has created facial recognition software. Another\nof the companies, Oculus, is one of the\nleaders in virtual and augmented reality.\nThe Metaverse is essentially an im-mersive, next-generation version of the\ninternet that relies very heavily on virtual reality, giving you the sensation of being physically present in a virtual world\nwhile interacting with those around the\nglobe. The idea is that people will be\nable to see and receive different sensory inputs to those around them if they\nchoose. Everything can be fine-tuned to\none\u2019s own preferences. The current concept for the Metaverse revolves around\npeople each wearing Facebook\u2019s AI\nglasses and seeing different things. This\ncould be problematic; the internet is\nalready something of an echo chamber\nwhen it comes to tailored content, and\nthe Metaverse only furthers this. Consider this in context: if someone were a\nliberal, and did not believe in the sale of\nguns, then gun shops would be hidden\nfrom them and perhaps replaced by and\nanadvertisingboardforsomethingmore\nto their liking. In a recent interview, the\nCEO of Epic Games, Tim Sweeney, said,\n\u201cThis Metaverse is going to be far more\npervasive and powerful than anything\nelse, if one central company gains control of this, they will become more powerful than any government and be a god\non earth\u201d. This may be a slight exagger-ation, but it stands to reason that many\npeople see the Metaverse the future of\nthe internet. So, should we be worried?\nThe Metaverse could unlock an entire\nworld of possibilities. It could allow disabled people to travel virtually to places that may not have ever been possible\nbefore, such as the Himalayas. Facebook\nclaims that we will be able to speak virtually with family as if they were in the\nsame room. However, we have to remember that with increased immersion,\nthere will be an increased danger when\naccessing this virtual world. Furthermore, a virtual world means whoever\nhas control of the code decides what\ngoes into it. Clearly, the Metaverse will\nmake money from advertising, particularly in targeted advertisings, which raises questions of privacy. The idea of the\nMetaverse is very similar to the plot of\nthe film Ready Player One, where the entire planet is engrossed by a virtual reality game. The game takes precedent over\nlife in the real world; people prioritise it\nover eating.\nFinally, if someone raisesd a weapon\nagainst you virtually, whilst it may not\ninjure you in real life, the terror that\nyou felt would be real and therefore the\nphysiological responses would also be\nreal. This could cause a lot of harm and\nmental scarring, particularly for chil-dren.\nSo, what\u2019s next?\nA lot of waiting, as the technology\ndoesn\u2019t seem to be quite at the level required for immediate implementation.\nHowever, it seems that the richest people on the planet have their own idea of\nwhere humanity will be in the near fu-ture. With Elon trying to build a colony on Mars and attempting to put chips\ninto people\u2019s brains, Mark Zuckerberg\nwith the Metaverse and Jeff Bezos developing his very own space program, the\nfuture is anyone\u2019s guess.\nThe Metaverse:\nShould we be worried?\nImperial\u2019s COVID-19 Response Team, together with researchers from\nthe University of Sussex, have designed MV-EpiEstim (MV: multivari-ant). The tool estimates the transmission advantage of a new variant, compared to a reference, and the authors suggest that it can be used as a first\nstep to quantify the threat of new variants. It was validated via simulation\nstudy and can combine information across multiple locations over time.\nUsing data from England, they found that the Alpha variant, first detected in the UK in November 2020, was 1.46 times more transmissible than\nthe wild type. This is consistent with existing esti-mates. What makes the tool more practical is that\nit only requires routinely collected disease surveillance data.

She is mysteriously able to travel\nback to the 1960s and she connects with a wannabe\nsinger, Sandie (Anya Taylor-Joy). Eloise soon discovers\nLondon is not what she expected and she becomes\nengulfed by the horror of it.\nInthebeginning,weseeEloiseexploringthecityand\nstruggling to stay afloat amongst people of different\nbackgrounds. As an international student who has\nonly moved to London for university, this feels all\ntoo familiar. We are unable to fit in and are alone in\na city away from home. Eloise copes with this feeling\nby getting in touch with the past and following Sandie\non her journey. The film transitions into a traditional\nhorror as Eloise begins to be haunted by images from\nthe past. It features overused jump scares, which\nfeels rather cheap and disappointing coming from a\nfilmmaker who is known for his creativeness.\nThe cinematography, however, is quite refreshing to\nsee.TheDirectorofPhotography,ChungChung-hoon,\nas some avid Korean cinema watchers may recognise,\nis a frequent collaborator of Park Chan-wook. In one\nof the scenes, Eloise covers herself with a blanket and\nthe camera pulls out. Normally, when a camera pulls\nout, it is to reveal more of the surroundings, but in that\nscene, it shows a seemingly endless blanket. It is such\nan unconventionally fitting choice as we follow Eloise\ninto the past.\nThe sequences in Caf\u00e9 de Paris alone prove the\nimportance of choreographing alongside the camera\ncrew. Choreographer, Jennifer White, collaborated\nwith Camera Operator, Chris Bain during the mirror\nand dance sequences, and the end product shows how\nthe choreography and camerawork complement each\nother.\nThomasin McKenzie succesfully portrays a character\nthat slowly descends into madness, but Anya TaylorJoy is surprisingly underused in the film. Additionally,\nthe main characters are not fully developed and lack\ndimensions. It appears to me that the only purpose of\nEloise\u2019s backstory is to explain her ability to connect\nwith the past since it does not reveal much about her\npersonality.\nLast Night in Soho is nightmarish in its portrayal of\nLondon,butthetruehorror,however,isthewaywomen\nare treated in the city. Eloise is harassed and stalked by\nstrangers. Similarly, Sandie is forced into entertaining\nmen by doing stuff she is not comfortable doing. Soho\nhas not changed at all over the past 60 years and to me,\nthis is much more terrifying than the story unravelled\nin the second half. Rather than collapsing into a basic\nhorror film, Last Night in Soho could have been much\nmore if it committed to the sexual harassment angle.\nThe latest entry of Edgar Wright tells the haunting tales of London.\nC\u00e9line Sciamma\u2019s Petite Maman is a charming,\ncompact exploration of childhood and, by\nextension, parenthood. \u2018Petite Maman\u2019 follows Nelly,\nan 8-year-old girl helping her parents empty her late\ngrandmother\u2019s home, and Marion, another girl of\nthe same age whom Nelly meets whilst exploring\nthe surrounding forest. Shot primarily in Sciamma\u2019s\nhometown, the film embodies nostalgia from the\noutset, with Director of Photography (DoP) Claire\nMathon\u2019s almost dream-like cinematography perfectly\nforming the timeless background of the story. The\nstory, however, almost takes a backseat here, with\nthe film\u2019s most charming moments being when the\ntwo girls are just, well, hanging out and being kids.\nJos\u00e9phine and Gabrielle Sanz, real-life twins who play\nthe two lead characters, are the clear stars of the show\n(being two of the five total characters in the story) \u2013\ntheir obvious chemistry allows them both to deliver\nincredibly convincing performances that carry the\nfilm to its conclusion. The actual plot sits secondary to\nthis slice-of-life vignette, but the film manages to not\noverstay its welcome with its notably short runtime of\n72 minutes \u2013 any longer, and it might have felt a little\ndrawn out.\nIn fact, this slightly directionless quality lends\nitself quite well to the timeless nature of the film \u2013\nSciamma herself described it as a sort of \u2018matriarchal\nmythology\u2019, and the general feeling is very serene and\nintrospective. Sciamma\u2019s trademark stripped-back\ndialogue, is at home here in this \u2018childlike\u2019 story, and\ngives the audience plenty of time for thought. It\nreminds us of our own childhood, and makes us think\nabout the childhood of our own parents; the questions\nwe should have asked, or those we wish we could have.\nThe film focuses specifically on the mother-daughter\nrelationship - of which, having never been either, my\nexperience is admittedly limited \u2013 in a very interesting\nway.\nOverall, Petite Maman isn\u2019t of the same Oscar\ncalibre as Portrait of a Lady on Fire \u2013 but I think it does,\nas it intends; it characterises the unchanging nature of\nchildhood. Our parents, just like us, were disappointed\nwhen they found out: the biscuit tin has always just\ncontained sewing supplies.\nDirectedby: C\u00e9line Sciamma\nStarring: Jos\u00e9phine Sanz, Gabrielle Sanz, St\u00e9phane\nVarupenne, Nina Meurisse, Margo Abascal\nJonah Hewett Film Writer\nNew Film Release\n\n"

    "content": "Originally situated in Northwest London, Comptoir V seemed a bit out of the way to review for\nImperial students. Thankfully, this Moroccan restaurant has set up their second brick and mortar in\nFulham, just a stone throws away from campus. This\nmeans that you can save yourself the commute while\nstill being able to see just what this restaurant has to of-fer. I went to their first branch to get a preview of what\nwas to come. Firstly, this store was slightly different to\nwhat has come to Imperial\u2019s home away from home.\nThey will be serving their brunch menu every day in\nFulham which is usually reserved for Sundays in their\nbranch up north so I gave that a look when invited over\nto weigh up just how good a vegan brunch could be.\nLet\u2019s start with the elephant shaped vegetable patch\nin the room. I am not by any means a vegan. I feared I\nmay have been too harsh on the meals by comparing\nthem to the meat-based equivalents. They welcomed\nthat! They have found the hack to get their food loved\nby vegans and non-vegans alike \u2013 flavour. The North\nAfrican flavours as ingredients help get the same\nrichness and depth no matter the source. They also\nmake some of their meat substitutes in house to ensure\ntheygetittotherightstandardforthemealsidebyside\nwith the more classic vegan substitutes.\nI first tried their Berry Go Round. Pancakes are a\nclassic brunch meal and would probably be the easiest\nto veganise, so it made for a good stepping stone before\nI went off the meat-free deep end. This was a stack of\nthree pancakes with a lovely anglaise between each\nlayer and wonderfully decorated. Each pancake was\nlight and fluffy though a bit small but that is brunch\nportions for you. It also was not overly sweet and didn\u2019t\nmake you feel heavy afterwards.\nThen there was the All Out Breakfast. Let\u2019s face it,\nsweet is easy. Put enough sugar and we all forget our\ntroubles. But, consisting of vegan sausage, bacon and\nfried \u2018egg\u2019 as well as others, this was the dish I was the\nmost hesitant about for fear of my meat loving ways\nclouding my judgement. I had to tip my hat to them for\nhitting it right out of the park by how good the meal\nwas. What got me was just how flavourful this was.\nEach element had it\u2019s own unique taste that worked\nwell on its own but also got a new dimension. Not a\nsingle aspect of the meal was not given the proper\nattention to make this the most well-rounded meal\non their menu \u2013 from the mushrooms and spinach to\ntheir harissa baked beans. If there was to be a standout\nit would be their homemade sausages which gave a\nsuch a sharp flavour without being overpowering. The\nMoroccan flavours at times reminded me of the meals\nI would have back in Nigeria. As with most vegan\nfood, it was hard to get a similar texture as the meaty\nequivalent but if you aren\u2019t going in looking for that,\nyou won\u2019t even notice. The multiple elements coming\ntogether made this my favourite of the brunch\nLast but not least, there was their gluten free French\ntoast. Like everyone else during lockdown, I spent a\nlot of time baking. This meant that I know how much\ngluten does to give that fluffy texture we adore so this\nwas a good final test to see whether they would be able\nto achieve that without gluten\u2019s helping hand. I am\nhappy to say that they delivered. Covered in fresh fruits\nas well, the presentation is also on point.\nI\u2019ve not been converted to the vegan lifestyle but\nthis is definitely a spot I can take anyone regardless\nof their food preferences. Its great for after uni or\njust a day where you know you don\u2019t have to go in.\nAs a small business they are very excited to join the\nFulham community and are showing that by offering\n10% off anytime you eat with them when you show\nyour student ID.

    "content": "Areport published by consulting\ncompany PwC has found that\nreaching the UK government\u2019s goal of\ntwo million green jobs by 2030 will require more efforts than are currently being put in. The report observed that in\nJuly of 2021, only 1.2% of the total advertised jobs, which account for 124,600\nnew roles, were considered green.\nThe Green Jobs Barometer, according\nto PwC, measures how well particular\nregions and sectors in the UK are performing in terms of boosting the green\neconomy. PwC defines a green job as\none that contributes to the reversal of\nclimate change\u2014this can be direct,\nsuch as engineering roles in developing\nclimate change technologies, or indi-rect, like education on sustainability.\nThe Green Jobs Barometer also found\nthat there is already a growing disparity\nbetween regions of the UK\u2014as expect-ed, Scotland and London performed\nbest, with regions such as Yorkshire\n& the Humber, Northern Ireland and\nWales lagging. To put this into per-spective, on an overall index measuring\nmultiple factors including green job cre-ation, carbon intensity of employment,\nand green workspaces, London scores\n60 out of 100, with Wales scoring the\nlowest at 31 and Northern Ireland at\n34 points. Kevin Ellis, Chairman and\nSenior Partner at PwC, says, \u201cleft un-checked, green employment will grow\nin the most fertile spots, but not necessarily where they\u2019re needed most.\u201d\nSunset jobs must also be taken into\naccount when measuring the success in\nincreasing green roles. These are jobs\nthat will be redundant following the\ntransition to a green economy\u2014they are\nmost common in industries that rely on\ncarbon-intensive fuels, such as the electricity sector. By 2030, 15.6% of jobs in\nLondon are expected to be lost to the\ngreen transition, whereas this figure is\nlower in areas such as Northern Ireland\n(2.1%) due to a larger workforce in low\ncarbon-intensive roles such as human\nhealth. PwC also reviewed the worker\nmentality through a survey and found\nout of 2,085 employees, 5.3% expected their jobs to be\nmade redundant\nfollowing the transition to a green\neconomy. However, PwC\u2019s analysis\nis more optimis-tic, suggesting that\nmany of these jobs\nwill be readjusted\nto accommodate\ngreener roles, creating a net job gain.\nThe creation of\none green job causes a knock-on effect and generates more\njobs elsewhere in the economy\u2014this\nis due to the local supply chain, which\ncreates demand for goods and services from other sectors. The Barometer\nfound that this effect is greatest in London and Scotland, where for one green\njob, an additional three are created else-where. This figure is lowest in Northern Ireland, where only two additional jobs are created.\nA statement\nfrom Carl Sizer,\nHead of Regions\nand ESG at PwC,\nconcludes these\nconcerns well: \u201cthe\nfocus shouldn\u2019t just\nbe on the number\nof jobs at risk, but\nwhere they are con-centrated, both in\nterms of industries\nand communities.\u201d\nMeasures must\nbe put in place, sooner rather than lat-er, to ensure that certain communities\nin the UK are not left behind, creating\nfurther imbalances in the economy.\nGreen Jobs Barometer finds\ndisparity in sustainability jobs\nMarie Mori Sustainability Writer\nFRIDAY 3RD DECEMBER\n13\nEnvironment.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nEdited by: Monami Miyamoto\nMarie mori\nMonika yordanova\nJack Cribb\nEnvironment\nREACHING THE UK\nGOVERNMENT\u2019S GOAL\nOF TWO MILLION GREEN\nJOBS BY 2030 WILL\nREQUIRE MORE EFFORTS\nTHAN ARE CURRENTLY\nBEING PUT IN\n\u201c\nThe ozone layer protects the Earth.\nHowever,itiswellknownthatmanmade chemicals destroy the ozone layer.\nNow scientists have discovered another\nmajor threat to the ozone layer \u2013 gases\nreleased by massive volcanic eruptions.\nA new study shows that the Niagara\nvolcanic rock contains bromine. Bromine is known to accelerate the hole\nin the ozone layer in the upper atmos-phere. Scientists point out that when\nmagma erupts from volcanic rocks, it\nreleases a lot of bromine, which can\ncause damage to an extensive area of\nthe ozone layer in the following years.\n\u201cWehavetobeawareofthisproblem,\u201d\nsaysatmosphericscientistKristinKruger\nof the Institute for Marine Research in\nGermany. \u201cLarge tropical volcanic eruptions could deplete ozone over large areas\u201d.

The appropriate latitude\nallows volcanoes in the region to eject\nmaterial into the stratosphere, which\nis about 16km above in a straight line.\nWhen chemical elements like chlorine and bromine rise to such heights,\nthey can react with each other and\nbreak down the ozone molecules. Kruger noted that the new study is the\nfirst to define in detail the role of bromine in ozone depletion, which is\n60 times more potent than chlorine.\nKutroff and his colleagues analysed\nbromine levels in thousands of volcanic rocks, some from land and some\nfrom the ocean. They concluded that\na single volcanic eruption could release 4000 to 600,000 tons of bromine.\nKruger pointed that enough bromine rising into the stratosphere would\nbe at least twice as damaging to the\nozone layer, and the highest concentrations of bromine ever found in the\ncurrent era were already \u201csufficient\u201d.\nFurthermore, it takes 3 to 6 years for\nthese chemicals to break down after\nthey reach high altitudes, and only then\nthe ozone layer can begin to recover.\nBromine in\nvolcanic rocks\ndestroys the\nozone layer\nHairong Sustainability Writer\n\n"

    "content": "FRIDAY 3RD DECEMBER 2021\n12\nARTS\nArts.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nRumi, better known to me and to other Turkish-speaking individuals as Mevlana, is a 13th century poet known for his teachings relating to the concept of love, namely the love one has for God. Claimed\nas the national poet of three countries (Iran, Turkey\nand Afghanistan), his influence can be felt strongly in\nthe entire region.\nAlthough I was raised with the awareness of Rumi\u2019s\nexistence, I would be lying if I claimed I was always familiar with his work. I only became more interested in\nhim recently after reading Forty Rules of Love, a fictionalised account of a portion of Rumi\u2019s life by the prolific\nTurkish author Elif Shafak.\nInterestingly, Rumi: The Musical and Forty Rules of\nLove cover a strikingly similar portion of Rumi\u2019s life.\nNamely, they cover his relationship with Shams Tabrizi, the Persian poet who is thought to have acted as\nRumi\u2019s spiritual instructor, sometimes going as far as\ncalling him Rumi\u2019s soulmate or muse.\nNaturally,theexactnatureofRumiandShams\u2019srelationship has been widely speculated on over the years.\nThe show treads these waters carefully. Ultimately,\nregardless of the exact nature of the relationship, for\nRumi: The Musical to work, the chemistry between the\nshow\u2019snamesake(playedbyco-writerNadimNaaman)\nand Shams Tabrizi (played by the Olivier and Tony\nnominated Ramin Karimloo of Phantom fame) would\nhave had to be on point. Well, it was\u2026 fine. At no point\ndid the lack of chemistry take me out of the story.\nHowever, I was also never quite taken aback by it as the\nrest of the characters in the play were.\nWrittenbyNadimNaamanandDanaAlFardan,the\nmusic is gorgeous, blending Middle Eastern cadences\nwith Western elements. It works best when the show\nleans into the Middle Eastern elements and does not\ngofullontraditionalclassicalmusicaltheatre.Thecho-reography is admittedly bizarre at times with a similar\nEastern-Western synthesis, but oddly, it works.\nOne thing that is most commonly associated with\nRumi regardless of one\u2019s familiarity with his work is\nundoubtedly the Whirling Dervishes, as was the case\nfor me too. Whirling Dervishes are men in long white\ngowns whirling as a means of meditation, in the meantime creating a striking visual of their skirts expanding\nas they whirl.\nThe musical shows commendable restraint when it\ncomes to whirling, which only makes an appearance\nnear the end of the first act, and not again until almost\nthe very end (although there are abstract suggestions of\nit here and there throughout). Every time the whirling\nis in full force on stage, it succeeds in serving a moving,\nextremely impactful visual, which may not have been\nthe case had it been overutilised.\nBilled as a semi-staged concert, the staging is simple.\nThanks to gorgeous lighting, the few set pieces come to\nlife and help fill the large Coliseum stage.\nOverall, the company clearly understand the assignment and deliver thoughtful, multi-dimensional per-formances. Karimloo soars as Shams, delivering a pitch\nperfect performance. Playing the titular Rumi, co-writ-er Naaman also more than holds his own.\nOn the whole, Rumi: The Musical is a significant\ntriumph, not just for shining light on one of the most\nprominent Middle Eastern poets for British audiences,\nbut also doing it delicately and without losing touch\nof what makes Rumi such an important figure in this\nregion.\nThe mystifying poet is under the spotlight in Rumi:\nThe Musical\nReviewed by Ozbil Dumenci Arts Writer\nRumi: The Musical\nWhere? The Coliseum\nWhen? 23-24 November 2021\nHowmuch?

The acting of all the main cast was outstanding\nand somehow managed to bring a nonsensical and unimaginable story to life.\nEven though the play started strong: with effective\njokes and a potentially interesting plot line, as it devel-oped, we witnessed very unpleasant scenes. The tastelessness exceeded the limits of what is reasonable, even\nfor a black comedy, resulting in an awkward and uncomfortable show.\nOverall, despite having many clever comical moments and excellent performances, the play was not an\nenjoyable experience for us. The attempted addition\nof humour and satire, in our opinion, did not add to\nthe telling of Alan\u2019s story. While the interactions between Alan and the other characters were important\nin understanding and experiencing the feeling of having one\u2019s identity erased; the metaphor was outrageous\nand seemed unnecessary in telling the essence of the\nmessage. Moreover, the play may have conveyed his\nfrustration and loneliness effectively enough without\nsuch explicit scenes of violence.\nAll in all, the cast gave as good as they got, but this\nwas an uncomfortable and, at times, tasteless window\ninto life after the Troubles.\n\n"
