    "content": "6 March 1998\nREAD ME\nTHE WEIR\nThe Royal Court\nStories to id in a bar are\nrarely of this quality.\nInstead of the usual style of\nbar reminiscence. The Weir deals\nwith haunting stories about ghosts\nand the supernatural. The set, a bar in various shades of brown,\nenhanced the feeling of small-town life. Here is where the story\ntakes place, and judging from the\nfirst half hour, the play would be\ntt i vial; cleverly written, and in\nsome places extremely funny, but\nultimately trivial. It seemed as if it\nwas going to drift along, with the\naudience merely required to\nabsorb the gloomy atmosphere.\nThe atmosphere shifts subtly\nwhen Valerie arrives. A stranger\nfrom Dublin, she is a very pretty\nwoman, who has, for her own private reasons, chosen to come to\nthis deserted place for peace and\nquiet. From being a purely male\nenvironment, the arena becomes almost erotically charged, with the\nmen telling their ghost stories in\norder to impress her. The men are\nall heavily superstitious, and seem to want to believe in ghosts,\ndespite laughing at themselves. I couldn't help thinking that all the\nstories were either embroidered or\nbrought on by alcohol. This was\njustified by one of the characters\ndescribing how he had drunk vast\nquantities of pot e in, the potato\nspirit, on top of a dose of the 'flu',\na combination which would induce\nghosts even in the least imaginative of us. Valerie, well-educated\nand un super st it it io us, is the only\none who' s truly possessed by\nghosts, and her story brought a lump the size of a tennis ball to my\nthroat. McPherson, with spine-tin-g ling ease, makes use of confessional monologues to build dramatic tension. He persuasively\nsuggests old Ireland, possessed by\nhallucinations; by an eerie sense of\nthe supernatural.\nEavesdropping in a rural Irish\nbar turned out to be a wonderful\nexperience, full of tragedy and\ncomedy, and a deep persuasive\nsense of humanity. The Weir unites\nthe Irish love of fable with the\nChekovian sense of waste, with\nevery character either having lost\nsomething precious, or never ha v in S gained anything. This is a wonderful play, beautifully set, and\nwell-acted, go and see it, it will\nstay with you for weeks.\nJulia H ARTS\nTHOMAS SCHUTTE\nWhitechapel Art Gallery\nT his is the first major exhibition of the German artist\nThomas Schutte. It offers a retrospective of over twenty years\nof diverse work, including water-colours, sculptures and architectural models.\nThe exhibition begins with a collection of small figures in bell\njars. They are supported on\ncolumns at head height, but\ninstead of just one figure per bell\njar, there are two, bound together\nin masking tape. People stare at\nthem, the figures grotesque p last a cine faces showing their embarrassment of the situation. A few\nmake the best of it - one in particular seems to be offering sexual\nbenediction to his smiling friend.\nBut these figures are telling a story.\nLike two enemies united in an\nuneasy alliance, the variety of gestured poses show the many faces\nof politics. Everywhere, high on the\nwalls are photographs of these\npathetic faces - a gallery of the\ndamned each one sneering at\nus,asking if we are any different.\nMoving on, the floor becomes\nalive with curious humanoid stat-u es: looking disturbingly similar to\naluminium versions of the marshmallow man from Ghostbusters,\nthese nine foot giants litter the\ngallery floor like bemused Doctor\nWho aliens. They look lost and\nconfused, gesturing and milling\naround in small groups as though in\nconversation. One statue sticks his\ntongue out, but his friend seems\nmore interested in the nearby\nwatercolours. Another looks like\nhe's mowing the lawn: he bites his\nlower lip in earnest concentration.\nLight plays off their shiny whipped cream features, constantly changing as you move around them. It\nbrings them to life and you can't help feeling sympathetic and\ninvolved with these poor child-like\naliens.\nIt was the watercolour portraits\nthat I was most impressed with.\nSchutte paints very quickly, capturing fleeting moments of time in\neconomical lines and often\nabstract areas of dark wash. Although sketchy, they are powerfully drawn: there is wide eyed\ninnocence and brooding sensuous-ness.\nOverall, Schutte's work represents a departure from 'modem'art\n- it does not require a title for the\nwork to have any meaning. Rather\nthe viewer is encouraged to make\nup their own mind about it. It's free\nand if you find yourself near\nWhitechapel, it's well worth a visit.\nAntony Butts\nthing to do with salad\nPhoto: Seeta\n23\n\u2022\nANTIGONE\nRiverside Studio\nIs Greek drama still relevant?\nOur regard for our rich literary\npast is practically non-existent.\nThese days, when the bloody\nTeletubbies are a more popular\nattraction in Stratford-upon-Avon\nthan Shakespeare's birth-place,\nand less and less people are taught\nClassics at school, one would be\ntempted to say no. So, when you\nhear that a theatre company is\nputting on a production of\nSophocles' Antigone, your first\nthought is \"Just what is the point of\nthat?\" Well, mine wasn't, because\nI 've read the play, I 've seen it as\npart of the Oedipus trilogy, and I know that stories about human\nrelationships are always relevant,\nwhether they were written in\n4 4 2 BC,I570 AD or this morning.\nAntigone is a play about hon-our, betrayal, love, fear and duty.\nThe story is ultimately tragic, and\ncontains ideas that have disturbed\npeople for over two thousand\nyears.\nAntigone is Oedipus' youngest\ndaughter. After his disgrace and\ndownfall, she went with him to\nColonus, where he died, at the\nshrine of the Furies. Before he\ndied, both his two sons wanted his\nsupport against their brother, and\nhe cursed them. With the results of\nthis curse, Antigone begins.\nBoth brothers are dead, and\none cannot be buried, he must lie\noutside the city walls as a mark of\nhis disgrace. Antigone wants to\nbury her brother, but due to her\nuncle's decree, she would be killed\nif she did. To further complicate\nthings, she is in love with her\ncousin, and he is in love with her.\nShe dies in the end; this is Greek\ntrade gy after all.\nHuman emotions haven't changed, it's just our situations\nthat are different. Civil war still\nexists, as do hate, incest, love and,\nfor all our cynicism, fragility. So, do you still think Greek drama is\nirrelevant?\nJulia H Antigone is showing at the\nRiverside Studios, Hammersmith\nnext week. See diary pages for\nmore detail, or email me at Felix\nfor more details\nJust enough room this week to say: come along to Salad Days, it's great,\nand also U LOG are performing Fidler on the Roof next week, which is\nalso worth going to see. Plugging your own show makes this job worth-while. (Heaves deep sigh, audience reach for Kleenex)\nArts Ed\n\n"

    "content": "0 COLUMNS 6 March1998 Schadenfreude is in abundance in ICU at the\nmoment. Not un surprisingly, the\nUnion must have collectively\nsmiled when they heard of\nWaterstone's predicament. It\nwould seem that not enough people are buying their books. Naturally, Waterstone's are not too\npleased about missing their targets\nby, if the rumours are true, 30%.\nThis must be dealt with, but\nexpanding into stationery is a non-starter on two fronts. Firstly, as\nsuggested in Felix last week,\nCollege should put a stop to this.\nThe lease, in a departure from\nusual College procedure, is water-tight- section 5.9.1 says that they\nmay sell books, tapes, journals and\nsuchlike and 'no other merchandise.' Interestingly, they are permitted to sell 'academic software',\nso my advice is to screw over the\nCollege Computer Shop, rather\nthan the Union. It goes on to say,\nin section 5.9.3, that the shop may\nnot be used 'for any illegal or\nimmoral act, nor as a club, betting\nshop [or] sex shop.' So despite the\nenormous potential market, an IC\nknocking shop is not on the cards.\nSecondly, diversifying the product\nrange could merely exacerbate the\nproblem. Though we all know that\nWaterstone's are here, few of us\nknow exactly what's going on at\nany particular time. Special offers\nare not promoted beyond a sign in\nthe window. They should be\nadvertising offers and new editions\nevery week in Felix, for instance.\nTheir current problems do not\nneed the likes\nof Sir John\nHarvey-Jones to\nsolve. This is\neasy to fix, and\ndoes not\nrequire 'nui-s ance or annoy-ance' to the\nUnion, which as\npart of Imperial,\nis banned under\nsection 5.9.2.\nStop w hinging and start man-aging, ladies and gentlemen.\nOne story that seems to rumble on in the background is the\nAccommodation Office incident\nwith C. Chan. Despite one intemperate letter from a warden- not\nterribly effective to bemoan 'public\nslang ing' in a letter where you label\nthe complainant a racist, CliveC\nD DQ\nCo00 official support for the Office has\nbeen conspicuous by its absence.\nLike Clive Wells, Ido not know the\ndetails, but I must say my treatment there has always been pass-able, though not worthy of any\ncustomer service awards. The\nwhole saga does raise one point\nthat really annoys me, namely the\nyou don't hear\nthe abuse that\nour staff have to\nendure' excuse,\ntendered every\ntime anyone\nmoans about\npoor service or\ntruculent staff.\nThis seems predicated on the belief that IC\nstudents are all\nneanderthal thugs, whereas\neveryone else in the country\nbehaves impeccably. The fact is\nthat the world is full of rude cus-to mers, who must be treated courteously by staff, however difficult\nthat may be. Staff in shops or\nrestaurants have to deal with people who are far more unpleasant\nthan the inmates here, and must\ndo so without resorting to fighting\nfire with fire. This is called professionalism. The problem here is not\nso much the staff, many of whom are very good, but the system. The\nsystem does not acknowledge that\nwe are customers. Commercial activities at Imperial need to be\nmore customer-focussed, to use\nthat horrible Americanism. If management instil this belief into their\nstaff, things will change. Being nice\nto people is not something that\nmost of us do automatically, as\nyou realise from reading this col-um n, and if we can avoid it, we\nwill. If we are told that we must be\nnice, we generally are. In fact, a little more professionalism throughout this place would go a long\nway.\nFinally, a cautionary note for\nmobile phone users. Cloning,\nwhich can be very expensive and\ninconvenient, may be something\nyou think only happens to other\npeople fare more careless than\nyou. Not so, for even our watchful\nHead of Security, Keith Reynolds,\nhas fallen victim to this crime,\ncosting the College \u00a3 5 0 0 last\nSunday. If it can happen to him,\ncan the world sleep easily at night?\n\"All political careers end in failure,\"\nthe recently deceased Enoch Powell\nonce said bitterly, when he was fired\nfrom the Shadow Cabinet by Edward\nHeath after his infamous speech\nwarning of rivers of blood if more\nimmigrants were permitted into\nBritain. In the Conservative Party\nright now, certain recently trampled\non careers are beginning to rehabilitate themselves despite accrued\npolitical wisdom, and for the right\nreasons. During the Conservative\nleadership election, Ann Widdecombe torpedoed Michael Howard's chances of gaining the\nleadership with an attack on his performance as Home Secretary. At\nissue was Howard's handling of the\nsacking of the Prisons Service\nDirector-General, Derek Lewis. This\nfracas had been ignited with the\nescape of three convicted murderers from a maximum security prison\non the Isle of Wight (which was then\ndowngraded to Category B). The\ngovernor of the prison was fired,\nwith Michael Howard announcing it\nto back bench Tory cheers. Later the\nDirector-General himself was sacked\nby Howard and then immediately\ntook action against the Home Office\nfor unfair dismissal. His argument\nwas that Howard had interfered with\nthe Director-General's job of actually running the prisons rather than\nkeep to his proper role of legislating\nand setting policy. There was a famous Newsnight interview in the\nwake of the sacking where Jeremy\nPaxman repeatedly asked \"did you\nthreaten to overrule him?\" to\nHoward who repeatedly dodged the\nquestion, making it painfully obvious\nwhat the truth was and a spectacle\nfor anyone not to keen on Howard.\nUnder Howard at the time was\nMichael Howard' s chances. Her\nphrase that \"there is something of\nthe night about him\" sparked a com ical row, with Howard retaliating\nthat she had deep affection for\nDerek Lewis, and that flowers had\nbeen exchanged. This precipitated\nher public assertion of her own virginity. The whole episode had infuriated Widdecombe, who had never\nliked the fact that Howard fired the\nDirector-General of the service for\nHamish Common\nWestminster\nEye\nAnn Widdecombe, who as Prisons\nMinister, earned the hatred of the\nLeft for insisting that expectant\nmothers should be handcuffed to\nthe bed right up until the birth\nprocess started. Ann is also against\nsex before marriage, and quite public about her virginity - she said \"if\nanyone says I am not a virgin, I 'll\nsue.\" When one considers her forthrightness over such sensitive issues,\nperhaps it was not so surprising that\nshe was happy to publicly finish off\nwhich she had responsibility.\nThe plot thickened in the last\nfew days, when it became clear that\nWiddecombe was being considered\nfor a Shadow Cabinet post. Michael\nHoward, now the Shadow Foreign\nSecretary, announced that he had\nforgiven her for destroying his leadership chances, further infuriating\nWiddecombe, who said that just the\nprevious week he had cut her dead\n\"in front of witnesses\", and a source\nclose to her saying \"this is ridiculous.\nShe has never exchanged two words\nwith Michael since last year. There\nhas been no make-up, no apology.\nHe is re-writing history. He is trying\nto make it look as though Ann is\nadmitting she got it wrong and she\nhad apologised.\" Publicly, though,\nthey are best of friends: \"Ann is\nbeing particularly effective in opposing this Government\", Howard said\nrecently. This is true: she makes regular appearances on television, is\nclose to finishing her novel, and her\nattacks on Blairism earned her the\n(probably complimentary) nickname\nof \"U boat Widdecombe\". This has\nwon her the approval of Tory MPs and ironically many on the Labour\nbenches who like her directness and\nindependence, reminding them of\nthe days before Labour's Millbank\nmind machine.\nIt is refreshing to see that directness and bravery are still cherished\nvalues in politics, and that Howard'ssli mines s in office was eventually\npunished. Miss Widdecombe is\nmaking a remarkable political comeback if does achieve Shadow\nCabinet status, and this will be\nundoubtedly despite of, rather than\nbecause of Michael Howard. It\nwould be nice to see the honest\ndefeat the deceitful in politics once\nin a while.\n\n"

    "content": "NEWS 6 March 1998\nCCUs - Nobody\nCares: It's Official\nDAVID ROBERTS\nThis week's executive elections\nfor both the City & Guilds Union\nand the Royal College of Science\nUnion were marred by extremely\nlow turnouts. Although a full compliment of officers for 1998-9 have\nnow been elected for both Constituent College Unions, a turnout of below 5% in each election - just half of last year's figures\n- raises questions concerning both\nthe election procedure and the\nperceived relevance of the CC Us to\nIC students.\nIn the RCSU elections, Katy\nNolan was returned as President,\nwith a comfortable 9 8 to 4 5 victory over New Election. Bob Walker\nand Douglas Graham also secured\neasy wins over New Election, as\nVice Presidents for Clubs & Events\nand Education \u00a3v Welfare respectively. In the only contested ele c tion, that for Vice President\n(Finance), Simon Torn squeezed\nthrough by a tiny margin of just 3\nvotes over William Bently on the\nsecond reallocation of votes.\nIn C&. GU, Hamish Common won through by 127 to 17 over the\never-present New Election chal-leng e. As a result of the recent resignation of the sitting Guilds\nPresident, Mr Common will take\nover immediately as C&G President, picking up the reigns\nfrom Acting-President Alex Tylee\nBirdsall. Elsewhere Jeevan Manala,\nSelina Vinayaga-Pavan and John\nQuantrell all emerged victorious, as\nVice President, Honorary Secretary\nand Honorary junior Treasurer\nrespectively. The Guilds Executive\nfor 1998-9 is completed by Pete\nBurge, returned as C&.G Association Representative. All\nposts were contested by just one\ncandidate.\nThe low turnout is a source of\ndeep concern within both Unions,\nalthough no-one is prepared to\npoint the finger of blame. An analysis of the figures shows just how deeply the problem runs; for exam-ple, a meagre three voters turned\nout in Civil Engineering (out of 500\nstudents), and just nineteen votes\nwere required to secure victory in\nthe Physics Department Representative election from over 8 0 0\npotential poll ers. Student Mugged near\nScience Museum\nED SEXTON & JON TROUT\nA student of Imperial College\nwas mugged last Sunday night.\nThe student was walking up Exhibition Road at around mid night, on his way to Southside\nHalls, when he was stopped by\nthree men near the Science\nMuseum. The men threatened the\nstudent with violence and produced a knife, forcing him to hand\nover ten pounds, his credit and\nswitch cards. They then squirted\nsome liquid of unknown comp osi tion into his face, before running\noff.\nThe student immediately went\nto college security, who informed\nthe police of the incident. Security\nand the police searched for the\nmen, using dogs to help in the\ntracking process. They were unsuccessful however, and the men are\nstill at large. The student was taken\nto hospital, but fortunately is\nbelieved to have suffered no permanent damage.\nKen Weir, Chief Security\nOfficer, did not think that the men\nwere targeting students in part icu lar. He believed that the attack\nwas a random incident, based on\nopportunism. He did however\nwarn students to stay alert when\nout at night, and not to display\ncash or valuables when in the\nstreet. He also advised students\nnot to travel ak>ne at night. Any\nstudents wanting further advice\ncan contact security, who have\nproduced a leaflet concerning the\nissue.\nNews in Brief...\nDERMOT\nMORGAN R.I.P The sudden death of comic actor\nDermot Morgan, made famous in\nBritain by Channel Four's Father\nTed, came only one day after he\nfinished filming the third series of\nthe highly popular show. Whilst\nholding a dinner party at his\nLondon home last Saturday night,\nMorgan collapsed to the floor\nwith a suspected heart attack and\nwas rushed to a nearby hospital,\nwhere he died shortly afterwards.\nFriends have commented that the\nstar burned himself out, ironically\njust when he was starting to\nreceive the critical acclaim for\nwhich he had striven so hard. His\nearly career was more than tinged\nwith controversy; his highly satirical radio series Scrap Saturday\n(1990-92) was a phenomenon which became required listening\nfor the Irish public, with the show even being quoted into the record\nof the Irish Parliament. RTE, the\nIrish Broadcaster, pulled the show\nat the height of its popularity after\npolitical arm twisting; they\nrefused also to show Father Ted, a surreal yet insightful journey into\nreligion, citing the show's anti-Irishness and its mockery of\nCatholicism as reasons. Rapidly\ngaining a cult following on both\nsides of the Irish Sea, Father Ted\nwill bow out permanently at the\nend of the new series. Dermot\nMorgan was a great comedian; in\nthe mould of Bill Hicks he\neschewed the establishment,\nclawed it down and rose above it.\nAn irreplaceable talent, be sure to\nsee him in his final work at his\ndazzling best.\nULU ELECTIONS\nUnbeknownst to most Imperial\nstudents, elections for the sabbatical positions in the University of\nLondon Union are taking place\nthis month. Unlike the recent sabbatical elections at IC, voting is\nnot open to all UL U students, as\nthis would involve the unfeasible\nprocessing of around 100,000\nvotes. Instead the positions will\nbe elected by approximately seventy delegates to UL U Council on\nthe evening of 16 March. Rob Clark, currently Deputy\nPresident (Finance and Services)\nfor ICU, is standing for Vice\nPresident (Finance and Societies)\nat the elections. He is the only\ncandidate running for the pos i tion, and as UL U Council traditionally avoids voting for New Election, his chances are felt to be\ngood. Nick Dunnett, a Royal\nHolloway student, is running for\nVice President (Sports). His candidature has caused controversy:\nCharlie Joynt, currently ICU\nDeputy President (Clubs and\nSocieties), was particularly\nscathing in his assessment of Mr Dunnett's chances, denouncing\nhim as \"shit\" and asking \"where\ndid this guy come from?\"\nThe other posts being contested are President, Vice\nPresident (Welfare and Student\nAffairs), and London Student\nEditor.\nLORDS DELAY\nFEES\nThe Secretary of State for\nEducation, David Blunkett MP, vowed this week to overturn the\nGovernment's defeat in the\nHouse of Lords over its Teaching\nand Higher Education bill. The bill,\nbased on the Dearing Report,\nwould require students to pay\ntuition fees of around \u00a3 1 0 0 0 a year. The Conservative amend ment to freeze grants at current\nlevels was passed by 143 votes to\n102. A second amendment, also\nproposed by the Conservatives,\nwhich would guarantee UK students at Scottish universities their\nfunding for the full term of their\ndegrees was also passed. Blunkett\ncondemned the Lords' decision,\nannouncing that Labour would overturn it in the House of\nCommons in time for the next\nacademic year. Andy Heeps, ICU\nPresident, denounced the bill as\n\"the thin end of the wedge -where will it stop?\". Citing the\nexample of the student loans system he added; \"What is really sad\nthat people will act like sheep and\npay up without a fuss.\"\n\n"

Christ. Reading\nout the ballot box figures while\nhacking, wheezing and generally\nsuffering from the thousand natural\ncoughs that flesh is heir to was a task more tricky than the most\nfiendish of differential equations or\ncontrol theory.\nThe worst things in life are free,\nand it has to be said that bacteria\nand viruses do not charge very\nmuch for their services. Illness ultimately comes in two varieties; the\ntype which you don't mind having,\nand the type which you do. The former variety was often joyously\nprevalent during my schooldays,\nwhere a quick thermometer on the\nradiator would occasionally prevent\nan unwanted test, field day, or\nsports trial...

Sleep, usually the most\nseductive of dark-haired damsels,\nbecomes a dull, boring ming er with\na beard.

Some of these are incredibly\ncontagious, and culminate in a death more painful and undignified\nthan that of anthrax, where the\nunlucky sufferer bleeds from every\norifice, including the eyes. Yuck.\nHistorically, one of the most voracious slayers has not been AIDS or\nCJD, or even one of these scary\npotential super-killers, but good old\ninfluenza. Yes, twice since the turn\nof the century, flu has claimed millions of lives in irrepressible epi-demi cs. In fact, scientists are so\nworried about another outbreak\nthat they are exhuming bodies\nburied in the permafrost of the icy\nnorthern wastes, believed to have\nhad their cards punched by the\n1919 outbreak, in an effort to\nexamine the deadly strain of the\nvirus. Let's just hope they are more\ncompetent than my friend Nick at\nschool with his Biology agar dishes,\nwho managed to infect half the\nyear with some terrible and unidentified plague grown from his own sputum.\nDespite these terrible mass-murderers, the micro-organisms\nwith which we conduct our everyday business tend to do little more\nthan annoy, so next time you notice the beginnings of the common cold, be thankful that you are\nnot drowning in your own mucus\ninstead.\nAH Campbell\nHOP Now Sells\nCartoon Mouse Mats!\nOnly \u00a34.00 inc.

Last week saw two big music awards ceremonies in the Grammy's and the Soul Train Awards\nas well as worrying rumours of Choice FM selling up and moving on.\nWelcome back to your regular\ndose on the happenings in the\nR&B world. Last week we had the\nGrammys and the Soul Train\nawards. The highlight of the Grammys was the Wu Tang Clan'sOl' Dirty Bastard, he bum-rushed\nthe show to make the announcement that 'Wu-Tang is for the children'. What the fuck? The awards\nfor rap seemed to be watered\ndown, with Will Smith and Puffy\npicking up awards for Alen In\nBlack and No Way Out, two hugely successful products commercially, but the best in their category? Erykah\nBadu cleaned up at both winning best album,\nsingle, new artist, best performance by a female,\nabout time they got something right. For a third\nyear in a row Babyface picked up best producer,\nsetting a new record for this award, he then\nwent on stage with Stevie Wonder and they performed their hit single How Come, How Long.\nThe 12th annual installment of the Soul Train\nawards, based on a survey of radio programmers and record retailers, were dished out in\nLA's Shrine Auditorium. The hosts for the event\nwere soul legend Patti LaBelle and the big man\nHeavy D. Whitney Houston received the Quincy\nJones Award for career achievement, and then\nwatched Erykah win all four awards she was up for. The best rap album went to Biggie for his\ndouble Life After Death, although deserved,\ncan't help thinking he wouldn't have got this if\nhe was alive. Puffy added yet another award to\nhis collection in the form of the Sammy Davis Jr\nentertainer of the year award.\nRumour has it that, once again, after failing\nto secure a London wide broadcasting licence\nthe Choice FM management wants to sell up. They have been trying in vain to get a London\nwide licence but have been blocked at every\nturn, and have decided enough is enough and they want out. The thought of London losing the\nonly real black music station is worrying, Kiss\n(who by the way have recently signed Dani Behr\nto do a show) seems to be turning into a more\nand more of a garage and dance station, but as\nI said it's just rumour and hopefully won't be\nhappening. Peace out. Here comes some album\nnews from Roni. Milen\nVARIOUS\nThe Blackout **\u2022*</2\nT he film. The Blackout, is\nalready showing in the\nmovies and stars Dennis\nHopper with Claudia Schiffer\nmaking her big screen debut,\nably directed by Abel Ferrara.\nThe director mainly being\nknown for his gangster film.\nThe King of New York.\nThe soundtrack itself is\nmainly composed by Joe Delia\nand Schoolly D. This soundtrack is unlike most big movie soundtracks nowadays. It\ndoesn't just have a bunch of\nTHA BOMB! ALBUM NEWS\ntop artists recording average to middling tracks... what is DOES have is the return of Schoolly\nD, orchestral moody music from Joe Delia, U2, Brew,\nHeather Redd, Gretchen Mol, Jill Wolfe and Harper Simon.\nThis eclectic mix results in a diversified album. Schoolly D, the gangsta rap pioneer,\nreturns with more of the same\nbut with all the usual pi aya stylings that is the norm now a days. His collaborations with\nJoe Delia provide pianos, guitars and hip hop beats mixed\ntogether and sounds good. Elsewhere, Grethen Mol provides tracks combining Spanish\nguitars, hard beats and monotone lyrics that work well. 112\nprovide a slow song that crashes with guitars midway through, and Heather Redd utilise s her voice to good effect.\nThis album pretty much has\nsomething for everyone with\nquite a few tracks mixed up\nwith styles from different genres in one song! The album\nactually DOES sound like it is\nprobably played in the movie\nunlike most releases! Another\ngood point to note is that it\ngives the listener the chance to\nlisten to other types of music\nwhich is no bad thing. Puff\nDaddy and the Foo Fighters.\nTexas and the Wu Tang Clan.\nWay back in the day, Public\nEnemy and Anthrax. Prodigy's remix of Method Man's Release Yo Delf. Wu Tang touring with Rage Against the\nMachine. Some work, some\ndon't. Thankfully this album\ndoes. CI\nRoni\nGangsta rr's album has seemingly been\npushed back until April. The Wu Tang\nClan members will invade all the record\nstores with many solo albums... Killah Priest's Heavy Mental should be out very soon and Inspektah Deck, Cappadonna, Gz a and Rza are\nalso expected to drop albums later in the year.\nThe soundtracks to Ride and Caught Up are\nalready available. Scarface's My Homies was released last Friday and is a double CD,a precursor to his movie. Imminent soundtrack\nreleases include Player's Club which has Ice\nCube's We Be Clubbin', sure to be a huge club\nfavourite. The film is directed by Ice Cube. Cube\nhas stated that there WILL be a NWA reunion\nwith all the remaining members: Dr. Dre, Cube,\nDJ Yella, MC Ren and some tracks have been\nwritten but Dr. Dre is very hard to find due to his\nongoing projects. So So Def will release an\nalbum by JD (aka Jermaine Dupri) and the So So\nDef All Stars, the single The Party Continues featuring Trey Lorenz and Da Brat, this is already\nbeing played on radio stations.\nAlbums available or slated for release in the\nnear future are Above the Law's Legends, Cocoa Brovaz' Rude Awakening, Big Punisher's Capital\nPunishment, Goodie Mob's Still Standing and\nPublic Enemy's Resurrection.\nRoni\nThe Phat Selection A Rose is Still A Rose - Aretha Franklin\nThe old skool diva gets together with a nu\nskool girl, Lauryn Hill to produce a an old style\ntune wit the new skool flav a Royalty - Gangstarr with K Ci and )o|o Hip hop with that R& J5 flav a from the\nJodeci boys, Premier lays down some phat\nbeats and Guru comes correct, all this adds up\nto Phatness\nThe Roof (Mobb Deep Remix) - Mariah\nCarey\nThis has been around for an age on import\nand at last its been given its UK te lease, dope beats, killer.\nDo I Qualify - Lynden David Hall\nSecond cut from his LP 'Medicine For My Pain'. Lynden shows off those vocals and the\nwhole thing comes out perfect.\nWeekend - Dave Hollister feat Redman\nand Erick Sermon\nTune. Its all good! The Body Rock - Mos Def, Q Tip and\nTash\nHip hop at its best, Q Tip from Tribe\nCalled Quest gets to g ether with newcomers\nMos Def and Tash to deliver an awesome\nmonster of a tune.\n\n"

    "content": "6 March 1998 COLUMNS\nML?LTD ater If, like me, you're sick and tired of ka k industrial\nbread that has no consistency or taste, then pay\nattention. To come up with this recipe, I 've taken\nfour or five different sources, mixed them up,\nboiled them down to their essence and then\nthrough trial and error brought forth something\nwhich is (I reckon) a good compromise between\ncomplexity and result. That is to say, it's not too\nmuch hassle and it tastes alright.\nNow it seems to me that most people are\nscared of using yeast. Yes, it is alive but no it\nwon't eat you. I can, however, almost guarantee\nthat your first attempts will not be spectacular,\nbut you will soon hang of it.\nAnyway, less rubbish more action. The liquid\nvolumes are approximate as they depend on lots\nof thinks like how damp it is, what sort of flour\nyou're using etc so they vary from time to time.\nYou will need:\n*\u2022 3 pints strong white flour\n(About 1 kg don't you know)\n\u00ab* 1 pint warm water\nAbout 1/2 wine glass of oil (olive if you're\nfeeling rich)\nr1t bl salt\n\u2022* 1 t bl dried active yeast\n\u00ab\" 1 pinch sugar\nStart off by diluting the yeast and sugar in a glassful of the warm water. This is to get it going\nand generally happy. It will take about 10 minutes to start bubbling and foaming if your kitchen\nis reasonably warm.\nPut the flour into a large and preferably heavy\nbowl, sprinkle the salt onto it.\nMake a well or dip in the middle of the flour,\npour in some of the oil and mix well with your\nhands (yes, hands so make sure they're clean).\nTo test whether or not you've put enough oil in,\ntake a handful of flour and squeeze it. The flour\nshould just about bind into a solid lump but\ncrumble easily.\nNow pour in the yeast and mix thoroughly.\nAdd the rest of the water a glassful at a time to\nstart of but be wary after about 2/3 of the pint,\nyou don't want to get the dough too soggy. This\nis the tricky consistency bit. 1 reckon the ideal is\na dough that comes off the bowl cleanly but just\nleaves bits sticking to you hands when you pull\nthem out.\nNow for the hard bit, kneading. Find yourself\na clean surface and plo nk the dough onto it. To\nstart off, just flatten the dough out and fold it\nback onto itself, twist it, beat it, squid ge it and\ngenerally take your stress out on it. After a couple of minutes the dough will become more elastic and will stop sticking to your fingers. This calls\nfor a change in tactic. Roll out the dough into a thick sausage shape, fold it in three\nlengthwise, give it a quarter turn and\nrepeat. You'll need to do this for about\n10 minutes by which time your forearms will\nburn and you'll be cursing my name but rest\nassured, 1 don't care.\nYour dough is now ready to rise. Grease your\nbowl with some oil, put the dough into it, cover\nwith a damp cloth and leave in a nice warm place\nuntil it has doubled in size.\nOnce the dough has risen put it back onto\nthe clean surface, punch it violently 2 or three\ntimes and then start kneading it again. Same\ntechnique as before and hopefully your arms\nshould have recovered by then. Do this for just a couple of minutes, add a few herbs and things to\nthe dough if you fancy and then put the dough\ninto greased baking tins (only fill up to half way)\n(this recipe will make two one pound loaves) or\ncut it up into balls to make rolls or whatever your\nimagination can come up with. The dough now\nneeds to rise again to make it nice and fluffy. It\nshould at least double in size but don't leave it\ntoo long or the whole thing will just deflate like\nleaky fart bag.\nOnce risen to your heart's content, bake the\nbread in a preheated hot (210\u00b0C, gas mark 7)\noven. Rolls take about 15 minutes, loaves 30 -35\nminutes. To check that the bread is cooked, take\nit out of it's tin and tap the bottom. A hollow\nsound means it is cooked.\nPiece of cake eh?\nOne last tip: for some reason (which I'm sure\nsome s pod can come up with), bread making\nusually goes pear shaped if the weather is very\nunsettled or thunder y so don't bother kids.\nAntoine\nThe ICU Cypriot, French, Hellenic,\nItalian & Spanish Societies\nfc present\nla Fiesta\njj pca uNi a^ TONIGHT!

Shin Yi Jeng\nwrote in his letter (1 105) that it\ntook three months for OS C to clear\nGerman Society but by my calculations it was just over a month.\nAnglo-German Society approached\nthe Overseas Students Committee\nin mid October 1997 for a decision\nregarding their new society. They\nhad submitted a constitution and a list of second ers late the previous\nyear but this had been lost by the\nUnion over the summer. To speed\nthings up for them we waived the\nneed to see a new second ers list\nand, as with all new societies,\nreviewed their constitution. We found several points to be incompatible with the aims of the OS C, including their name and several of\ntheir objectives. I explained that in\norder to be accepted by the OS C they would have to change these\npoints because their aims emphasised British-German relations\nrather than promotion of German\nculture, but Anglo-German Society\nthemselves decided that they\nwould prefer to keep their constitution as it was.\nI then suggested S CC as the\nnext avenue to explore since societies such as Irish, Welsh, Sikh and\nTamil Societies, which do not readily fall under the OS C banner,\nbelong to SCC. However, S CC were\nunwilling to take them on. Contrary\nto Mark Baker's information\n(1107), the matter was then\nreferred to Rob Clark, the DP (F&S)( there was no DP(C& S) at the\ntime), who thought it best that they\njoin OS C. Anglo-German Society\nduly changed their name( to\nGerman Society) and two of their\nobjectives and joined OS C by late\nNovember. They were not 'kindly'\ntaken on by OS C but rather\nbecause they revised their const it u tion. German Society perhaps\nunknowingly prolonged the process\nby initially declining to change their\nconstitution.\n1 believe the decisions 1 made\nwith and on behalf of the OS C can\nonly be described as accountable,\nnecessary and fair\nTanya Siraa\nOS C Vice Chair\nt. sir a a@ ic.ac.uk\nThe inefficiency and general poor\ntreatment received by Shin Yi Jeng\nand friends may be no surprise,\nbut there is something here I don't understand: If they wanted\nan Anglo-German society, then\nwhy the hell couldn't they have\none? It is ludicrous to say that\ntheir aims were \"incompatible\nwith the aims of the OS C\" and\noutrageous that they were\nexcluded and forced to change\ntheir constitution. The CSCs are\nthere to support students' clubs\nwhatever they are, and certainly\nnot there to dictate what they can\nand cannot do. Ed\nDear Felix,\nWe are writing to clear up a number of points that have been\nraised in recent weeks with regard\nto the Anglo-German Society (now\nGerman society) and the confusion\nthat surrounds the acceptance of\nthe club.\nThe Anglo German society\ncame to a meeting of the Social\nClubs Committee(11/11/97), where the matter of them joining\nSCC was debated by the attending\nchairs of S CC clubs. It was noted\nthat the aims of the proposed club\nduplicated another ( ERASMUS), and that the coexistence of the\nclubs would be detrimental to both.\nThey were advised to reapply to\nthe OS C, who accepted them as\nthe German society less than two weeks later.\nIn total, the S CC was involved\nin this process for less than one\nmonth. CSCs do not meet more\nregularly than once a month (to\nsave bureaucracy). The CSC system\nworks, and succeeds in being what\nit is designed to be \u2014 a facility to run clubs and societies by students\nfor students.\nYours,\nCaroline Gibbons, SCC Chair\nKaren Yates, SCC HJT\nDear Felix\nIt was very encouraging indeed\nto have received so many supportive responses in the last two weeks\nregarding the trouble I went\nthrough in setting up the AngloGerman Society. Now I want to clear up one last problem: I am not\na he; Iam a she!\nSincerely\nMISS Shin Yi Jeng\nWATERSTONE'S WARNING\nDear Felix,\nWhilst 1 would love to believe\nthat Waterstones are \"just firing a warning shot\", I remember wanting\nto think a similar thing about the\nbookshop a couple of years ago. 1\nhope that Felix continues to cover\nthis issue well (and that IC students\nread it!) so that a Bookstore Mark II\ncannot occur.\nThanks,\nKaren Yates (Physics 4)\nOFF!\nDear Jeremy,\nRe Red Card for Football\nFourths\nIam writing on behalf of the\nfootball club committee as it is felt\nthere are several issues that need\nto be addressed. The incident at\nBath was regrettable and does not\nbring credit to the club, union or\ncollege - this is not in question.\nHowever, the article in question\nwas one-sided and unfair. As far as\n1 am aware, no-one from the football club was contacted before the\narticle was written and so the article was inevitably prejudiced.\nMembers of the fourth team have\ndescribed their behaviour as loud\nand boisterous, as the bar evenings\nof sports teams tend to be, but\nhardly abusive until they were dealt\nwith in a confrontational and inappropriate manner.\nThe tone of the article is also\nunfortunate - it seems to be advocating severity to the disciplinary\ncommittee, which is hardly Felix's role in college - as is the reference\nto comments attributed to the\nclub's captain, Donal Keane (please\nnote the spelling), which he cannot\nremember making and especially\nnot in the context that they were\npresented in. The club's players\noften play twice and train once a week, and the teams' performances\nthis year have reflected their efforts\n- aUL U cup final this Saturday for\nthe firsts and the best results of any\nLondon college in BUSA - and find\nit disheartening when they seem to\nbe under attack from the very organ\nthat should be lauding their efforts.\nWhile we realise that students\ncan only spend so long on their\nFelix investigations, articles that are\na little more considered would be\nappreciated.\nYours sincerely,\nSimon Dunsby (deceased)\nHAIR NEWS HAIR NEWS HAIR NEWS\n!

    "content": "20 FILM 6 March1998 Good? It's absolutely brilliant!\nGOOD WILL HUNTING\nStarring: Robin Williams, Matt Damon Director:Gus Van Sant\nA film about a tough but\ncharismatic genius with\nproblems, trying to fit in at\none of the best technical colleges\nin the country might seem a familiar theme to readers of Felix.\nFortunately, it is set in the more\npicturesque Boston, and the\npeople in the film are far prettier,\ntoo.\nNewcomer Matt Damon( who\nco-wrote the screenplay with best\nfriend and co-star Ben Affleck) is\nWill Hunting, an angry young man,\nbut one who is blessed with a photographic memory and the ability\nto instantly solve complex mathematics problems. However, Will\nprefers menial jobs, drinking with\nhis best mate Chuckie (Affleck) and\ngetting into trouble. When he is\nstaring at a jail sentence, his only\nway out is offered by a maths\nprofessor, providing he hones his\ntalent and visit a college academic\n/ therapist (Robin Williams). It is the\nsessions with the therapist, and the\nflourishing of a relationship with a student at MIT (Minnie Driver), that\nhold the key to Will's survival.\nThis is a quite superb movie.\nThe screenplay, although written by\nyoungsters, is warm, funny, intelligent and poignant. The acting is\nexcellent, from the young talent to\nthe seasoned veterans, with\nWilliams reminding the audience\nwhy he has been previously nominated three times for an Oscar. Van\nSant keeps the film personal without getting overly sentimental, letting the actors do their work and\nthe script weave its magic. If you\nare not moved by this film then you\nhad better check your pulse. D David Norman\nMRS DALLOWAY\nStarring: Vanessa Redgrave, Natascha M cEl hone, Rupert Graves\nDirect on Marle en Gorris\nWin Good Will Hunting\ntickets courtesy of the\nODEON\nKENSINGTON\nAs you'll see from above, the film\nof the moment is Cood Will\nHunting, starring Matt Damon and\nRobin Williams in Oscar-winning\nform. Films as character-driven as\nthis are usually laden with sent i ment, but in Gus Van Sant's movie\nthe clich es are kept firmly in their\nplace. All in all, it's the perfect\nantidote to the stress of those\nimpending exams.\nYou'll be completely un shocked to read that the generous Odeon Kensington has given us five pairs\nof tickets as prizes for this week's competition. To enter, e mail us on felix@ic.ac.uk with the answer to:\nName two of the three other\nfilms for which Robin Williams\nhas received a Best Actor\nOscar nomination\nLast week we were offering\ntickets to see The Edge, Anthony\nHopkins' latest film featuring a cameo by Elle Macpherson. It is\nstill showing and is a worthwhile\nalternative to the usual mindless\nthriller. We wanted to know the\nfilm for which Sir Anthony won his\nBest Actor Oscar. The answer was,\nof course, that \"Chianti-with-liver\"\nclassic The Silence of the Lambs.\nThe five winners drawn out of\nthe hat at random are:\nJenny Kay\nA Worapishet\nCarmen Belda\nSheyi Claxton\nLin Hong Come and pick up the prizes from\nthe Felix office whenever you like.\nBe afraid, this is a Virginia\nWoolf story. Okay, I confess,\n1 haven't actually read the\nbook myself but by all accounts the\nfilm is true to the novel. The time is\n1923; the place is London; Mrs Dalloway (Redgrave) is middle aged, married to a man of excellent\nsocial standing and about to throw\na party. The events all take place\nfrom morning to evening, in a single day. As she prepares for the\nparty, Mrs Dalloway reminisces\nabout her past, more specifically\nthirty years previously when she\nwas young, beautiful (McElhone)\nand undecided over her affections\nfor an exuberant and adventure-seeking suitor. By a strange coincidence that same man is back from\nIndia and will be paying her a visit.\nAlso at the party will be her best\nfriend of thirty years ago. This is a good prompt to ponder about the\n\"What if?\"s of life and to see how everybody has turned out.\nIf the film were just about mid life crisis it would be rather average\nbut interwoven with Mrs Doll o way's meandering s is the\nplight of Septimus Warren Smith\n(Graves), a shell-shocked veteran\nof World War I. His angst and his\ntreatment by the establishment,\nthe medics in particular, makes for\ndisturbing viewing. Septimus and\nMrs Dalloway never actually meet\neach other but his despair touches\nher through indirect means. The\nconclusion of the film is an insightful contemplation. The novel is in\nfact an introspective of Virginia\nWoolf who was middle-aged when\nshe wrote the book. There is the\njuxtaposition ing of sanity and\ninsanity, her distaste for the med ical profession, a hint of lesbianism\nand tragically also a suicide.\nThis film will not appeal to the\naction-phil es amongst you( just the\none explosion) but it would be\ndoltish to dismiss it as a mere\nperiod adaptation. The style of the\noriginal narrative was ironically\ninfluenced by that new exciting\narts-medium called Cinema. Alan\nCox gives the only mediocre performance from the excellent cast.\nThe only question we are left with\nis why Redgrave is wearing the\nQueen Mother's outfit in the opening scenes? O Stef\n\n"

Imperial is a prestigious University and yet there is no\nprestigious event to reflect our sta-tus. We thought we'd do something about it.\nA lot of people have said that\nthe event seems very expensive,\nand we admit that \u00a3 4 5 isn't cheap,\nbut we would like to explain what\npeople will be getting for their\nmoney. The cost per head to run\nthe event is around \u00a3 8 0 (without\nmaking any profit), the difference\nbeing met through subsidy and\nsponsorship. It may help to bear in\nmind that a typical Oxford May Ball\nthis year will cost around \u00a3 7 5 per\nticket. The ticket price will include a three-course meal, drinks, a live\nband, a casino, travel to and from\nthe event all topped off with a stylish range of high-calibre entertain-ment.\nAnother misconception is the\nscale of the event. Alexandra\nPalace is a huge venue - we have a capacity of two thousand people\n(although we are expecting nearer\na thousand). This will be unlike any\nother event you will have seen at\nImperial.\nIt's also worth noting that the\nevent is open to everyone - students (undergrads and post grads), staff and Alumni of Imperial as well\nas their guests. We want it to be\nrepresentative of all members of\nImperial and we would really like to\nsee people from all corners of the\nglobe turning up in their countries\nformal dress.\nYou may wonder why we have\ngone to the trouble of organising\nthe event. Most of us on the team\nalready have jobs, so we're not just\ndoing it for CV points. We are\ndoing it because we want to go to\na ball - a night we will remember\nfor the rest of our lives.\nThis is the first event of it's kind\nand you have an opportunity to be\npart of it. If it's a success then it will\nbecome part of Imperial's heritage\nand it will be thanks to you that it\nhappened. Tickets will be available\nsoon from the Union Office, we\nhope to see you there.\nSummer Ball Team\nSETHI RULES\nDear Felix,\njust to let you know I found a room at the toilet end of the\nsouthside bar (literally the toilet\nend for those of you who think this\nis a vague indication of it's location)\nlast Thursday. Anyhow, it turned\nout to be the i mag in at iv ley named\nSouthside Disco and through what\n1 gathered was mostly the efforts of\nDJ AI;ck Sethi it was transformed in\nto the coolest , most laid back\nat mos place in the college for chilling after spending a hard portion\nof the week being a student. If your\nidea of relaxing involves cool tunes\nand space then you could do a lot\nworse than checking this venue\nout. IC radio can only be encouraged to promote this venue and\nmaybe spend some cash on decor.\nRespect to Al;ck s' Electric Cafe\nfor showing what can be achieved\nwith the college fac ill i ties if you're\nprepared to get of your arse and\ndo something and for giving us a real treat.

If the\nstudents who wrote are in a Hall of\nResidence, they should go to their\nWarden and discuss the complaint.\nIf not, I'd invite them to contact\nme and allow me (in confidence if\nnecessary) to see if we can sort the\nproblem out.\nI'm contactable on\nj. has s ard@ ic .ac.uk.\nregards\nJohn Hassard\nWarden Selkirk and Tizard Hall\nWHY OH WHY?\nDear Sir,\nWe are indeed deeply honoured to become aligned with such\nluminaries as College Catering, the\nLabour Party and the European\nCommission by having been\nmoaned at by Simon Baker in his\ncolumn for you esteemed organ.\nYours faithfully,\nMartin Frost (RCSU Publicity\nexternal)\nJames S Farrer (RCSU Publicity\ninternal)\nCongratulations, publicity officers.

    "content": "FEATURE 6 March 1998\nERVIEW\n^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^\nMr C should be a familiar name to all of you. He\nis a member of a band called The Shamen that\nhas had considerable mainstream success since\nthe beginning of this decade. As if that wasn't enough, he also produces cutting-edge music\nwhich he describes as tech-house and is a much\nsought after D) in the global dance scene. Layo's CV reads very much as above without the Shamen\nsection. Together they both own and run a nightclub in central London called The End, and a cut-ting-edge radio station called Gaia Live that\nbroadcasts solely on the internet.\nElectronic music has many enemies and critics.\nThere are those who dismiss it as the lowest caste\nof music; generated by machines with no real need\nfor any talent as such. There are people who accept\ncomputers as musical instruments but cannot\nunderstand the concepts of techno music so far,\nshunning the phrase \"underground\" and blaming the\nartists for being too anonymous and out of touch\nwith the general public.\nI'm glad that electronica, techno or whatever\nyou choose to call it actually has role-models like MrC and Layo. Although it was conceived as an anti-establishment youth movement, they are not afraid\nto push it onto the widest possible audience that it\ncan reach. They are diplomats, man ou ev ring big\ncommercial interests alongside the simple values of\nartistic passion and integrity. They are both real and\n3-D characters and are not afraid to show that they\nare having fun and enjoying what they do.I asked MrC how he began in dance music. \"I got started when I was twelve I suppose, dancing on\na dancefloor, getting in front of the speakers and\nhaving it lat ge!I was a disco kid when 1 was in my\nearly teens and 80's soul, funk, electro were all\nmajor influences on me.\"\nGetting involved is how MrC learnt what he\nwanted to do as a musical artist. Most people don't realise that he was making music long before the\nShamen ever carried his name into the charts. \"I started DJing at the end of 1987. Basically, I'd made\nmy first track and decided that I didn't want to just\ndo raps on records. I wanted to get into it a lot\nmore; find out about writing and producing and\nsequencing. 1 thought the best way to do that would\nbe to DJ because you have hands on experience.\"\nThe route that took Layo into music is equally as\ninteresting. He started putting on and promoting\nparties from the age of sixteen. DJing didn't come\ninto the picture until his university days. A year of\nmaking shows for his local student radio station led\nhis passion to organising and DJing at his own club-night. \" How he got that degree with that club I 'll\nnever know because it was mental!\" quips MrC, \"It\nwas absolutely bonkers every single Monday!\" As a DJ, Layo is very much a force to be reckoned with. He describes his sound as \"varied, as my\ninterest in music is fairly varied. When I play a set it's predominantly a kind of tech-house, but I have a lot\nof interest in breaks. I play a lot of breakbeat and\nthat also slips into drum'n 'bass quite heavily and\nsome downtempo breaks. Basically if music is funky\nI'm into it, whatever it is!\"\nSo what is this sound called tech-house that the\ndance media has adopted? \"It's actually been\naround for a long time.\" explains Layo, \"It's more of\nan attitude in the music.\" This style is seen by many\nas being the saviour of techno, going back to the\ndays when house and techno shared equal space in\nthe DJ's box.\nLayo also explains his role as a producer of music. \"Ido two types of music\npredominantly. One is a tech-house\nsound on a deeper level which I do with\nRichard as Killer Loop. I also do breakbeat\nwith Matthew B as The Usual Suspects.\nThis is a similar kind of vibe, but instead of\njust four on the floor, it's breaks.\" Layo\ndescribes his musical standing as a producer of \"intelligent party music.\"\nI had decided before the interview to\ntalk to MrC about his involvement with\nthe Shamen. In all honesty I wasn't even\nsure whether they were still to get he t or\nnot! I actually ended my teenage years listening to their music, but lost touch with\nall that when I got into the music 1 now\ncover. I also wasn't sure how my questions would be answered; so long after\nthe time and on the subject of such a well-trodden conversational path.\nThroughout, MrC showed no sign of\nimpatience and responded to the best of\nhis ability.\nNot many people know that The\nShamen started out as an indie band and\nthat over time an electronic element progressed into their sound. MrC got\ninvolved with the band in 1989 when they\nworked together on a track called Move Any Mountain. The track was released as\nProgen '91 and made it as a top five UK\nhit. The success continued with a string of\nhit singles and albums. Was it this mixture\nof different styles that made the Shamen\na success? \"I think it was definitely a contributing factor.\" says MrC, \"We were the\nfirst hybrid rock/dance band to crossover.\nI like to think that The Shamen opened a lot of doors in that respect to a lot of\nother bands.\"\nThe most (in)famous piece of work\nfrom the Shamen was the track\nEbeneezer Goode. This picked up a vast\namount of media attention and criticism,\nmainly for it's so-called \"blatant pro-drug\nmessage\". I was eager for MrC to give us\nhis version of events, and from his\nresponse I get the feeling that it was not designed\nto offend.\n\"I was DJing in Edinburgh when a kid came up to\nme and said T was only thirteen or so at school\nwhen I heard EG and we thought the chorus was all\nabout this guy called Ebeneezer Goode and he was\ncalled Eezer for short.' That's what everyone in his\nschool thought. They didn't perceive it to be a drug\nsong and it wasn't until the media blew it out of all\nproportion that people started to say ' Oh! Maybe it\nmeans that then!'\n\"To the granny listening to it on Radio One, she\nwould have thought it was a cheeky song about this\nDickensian character. So it was really the press that\nhyped it ONLY as a drug issue tune. And, yeah of\ncourse it was about ecstasy. I can put my hands up\nand say that now. It's out of the way and 1 don't have to promote it anymore. It wasn't pro-drugs\nthough. You just have to listen to lines like, 'e's the\nkind of geezer who must never be abused' and 'very\nmuch maligned and misunderstood' to realise that\nwe're actually trying to tell people that the drugs\navailable are actually rubbish, and you shouldn't be\ntaking them and be aware.\n\"Get information about what's going on,\nbecause it's an information society that we're living\nin. Unless you're informed about what you're doing,\nyou're going to get yourself into trouble. It's very\nimportant that people receive information and that\nwas partly what the song was about.\"\nWith his roots in the electronic underground, MrC doesn't believe that mainstream success compromised him in any way. \"Being in a very successful band like The Shamen has allowed me to go and\ndo other ventures; like build a state-of-the-art stu-dio, get involved in night clubs and labels and stuff\nlike that. All 1 can say is that The Shamen has been\na most marvellous experience and has helped me\nout no end!\"\nThe Shamen are still together. Look out for two\nforthcoming singles (Universal and / Do) and an\nalbum in May called Ultimate Voyage. Due to other\ncommitments, MrC sees this as the last ever\nShamen material.\nThis period seems to be a time of transition for\nboth MrC and Layo. MrC is winding down his legendary techno label called Plink Plonk for the mote\naccessible sounds of a newer company named after\n6 March 1998\nINTERVIEW FEATURE\nJ F3oIl iq en ce Mr C and ^ ^ cohort Layo\nhis club The End. He is also bringing The Shamen\nchapter of his life to a close to help Layo run The\nEnd. So why this gradual man ou ev ring towards a new direction? This duo are on a mission! They want\nto change the way techno is perceived and treated.\n\"It's time to push to a new direction. Techno\nneeds to be reinvented, it's an old thing that's been\naround a long time. It's received a lot of bad press\nand negative attitude. Techno is seen to be hard,\nbland, in yer face music that gir lies don't like. Well\nthat's all totally wrong! That's why it needs to be\nreinvented, so that people can see that techno is\nfunky and glamourous.\n\"Plink Plonk got stereotyped as an abstract techno label.\" MrC describes the music from his new\nlabel The End as, \"Dead groovy beats, dark as heck\ntechno, yet sexy sexy sexy. And that's what it's all\nabout. You can't have this macho, minimal, young\nman, top-off thing. It's going nowhere apart from up\npeople's rectums and it's not good!\" One of the ways that MrC and Layo have tried\nto redress the issue was to open up their very own nightclub called The End. They now have the power\nto choose the music they deliver each day of the\nweek. The End is a large club with a capacity of\nabout two thousand. When it opened in 1995 it was\nfamous as being a club that had been designed, not\nby promoters who find the lowest common denominator to make as much profit as possible, but by\ntwo DJs who were passionate about the music they\nplayed and wanted to spread it to as many people\nas possible. Phrases such as 'well thought out' and\n'user-friendly' were used to describe it on its open-ing.\nSo how does Layo describe the club?\n\"The design! It speaks for itself. Probably\nthe best sound system in the world. A stunningly beautiful club. Really friendly,\ntotally safe and fully air-conditioned.\" I ask MrC if, after The Ministry of Sound\nand other places, London really needed\nanother super club. \"Absolutely! London\ndidn't have an underground club culture\nat that time, it had a handbag culture, and\nmaybe a bit of a hard bag culture if you\nwere lucky. London needed a kick off its\nhandbag to go somewhere in another\ndirection.\"\nIt's not only the music that MrC and\nLayo play that is served up in The End.\nLayo cites DJs as diverse as Sasha and DJ\nHype, all of whom have graced The End.\nAnd with regular residents such as Darren\nEmmerson, Carl Cox and Jim Masters, this\nmust be quite a place! \"We're trying a huge variety of nights to bring all good quality music under one roof.\" concludes\nLayo.\nI ask if they are worried that London's notoriously fickle club culture might one\nday deem The End 'out of fashion'.\n\"People are very fickle to fashion. We're\nnot a fashion club,\" explains MrC,\"1 mean we do get fashionable people in but\nwe don't court all that. We're about music\nand what's actually happening before it\nhappens.\"\nAnother of the duo's collective babies\n13\nis Gaia Live, a radio station that broadcasts exclusively on the internet. The concept of electronic\nradio is still in its infant stages and Gaia Live is a few\nmonths old, but towards the end of last year it was\nachieving one hundred thousand hits per month.\nThe possibilities are endless, as it can be picked up\nby anybody who has access to the internet.\nThe sound of the station is naturally very important to both partners. \"We're not after the pirate\nsound, which can be quite commercial.\" says MrC, \"We're more concerned with the quality and musical output of shows.\" The DJ lineup can only be\ndescribed as the cream of London's underground.\nMrC, Layo and Matthew Busnwacka B, Wiggle\nCrew, Rugged Vinyl, DJ Rap, Giles Peterson, Dr S Gachet, Dave Angel, Weird Beats Collective, the list\nstill goes on...! The station broadcasts from Friday\nnight to Sunday night at www.Gaialive.com and is\nworth a listen!\nIn its present form, the presentation is much like\nany terrestrial radio service. I'm curious to know if\nthe possibilities of the internet could one day make\nprojects such as Gaialive more interactive.\n\"Absolutely! I mean what you can do with the internet is more interactive anyway. We already broadcast events from The End (by audio and visual\nmeans) onto The End website. I do a weekly show\non Kiss FM which is broadcast onto the website as\nwell,\" replies MrC. \"Basically electronic radio is the way forward.\nPeople are getting into the internet in a big way. It's right around the corner where you can buy a little\nbox to plug into your TV and a telephone socket and\nyou're on the net. That is going to mean a hell of a lot. Give it another five years and every home will\nhave access to the internet. Then the power of\nentertainment and promotion and marketing and\neverything else that comes with electronic information will all be at our fingertips. The sky's the limit.\n\"We already have chat rooms where people can\ntalk while Gaia Live is going on. It might be good to\nhave a list of records and sound bytes of these\nrecords. With the aid of a virtual set of turntables\nand mixer you could mix them yourself. That would\nbe good fun. Who knows what the future holds?\"\nI asked them whether mixing records is an overrated and overpaid hobby that should have been\nconfined to the bedroom. MrC has something to\nsay about this, \" A great comparison is football. We can all kick a ball around in the streets just as your\nbedroom DJ can mix some records together, but\nthere's loads more to it than that. People have a very\nwarped impression about the whole thing. It takes\nloads of dedication and hard work.\"\nThere is always a constant struggle and war of\nwords between the mainstream and underground\ncamps. I ask them both to comment. \"Music is art\nlet's not forget.\" says MrC, \"If someone makes a piece of music that everyone says is really nice then\nhow can that be art? It isn't challenging. Everyone is\nof the same opinion. A true piece of art should move\npeople to be critical for and against it otherwise it's not really art. If it doesn't make you question it and\nit doesn't form some sort of debate then it isn't art.\"\nLayo has the final word, \"It's easy to knock the\ncheese. It's harder to be on the ball and actually\nknow what's going on.\" You can check out MrC and Layo as Djs at The\nEnd club every month where they play the Subterrain\nnight. al;ck\n\n"

    "content": "6 March 1998 MUSIC 15\nALBUMS DREDGE\nYears of Violation No Stars\nTake some mindless, repetitive lyrics, and mix well with\noverpowering, head-banging\ndrum beats. Add a pinch of Pain,\npreferably from the House of, and\na well ground Red Hot Chilli\nPepper. Leave to stew for approximately four minutes in a Metallica\nbowl. Serve with generous helpings\nof anything that clashes, grates or\ndisturbs - et voila, you have\nDredge.\nHeavy metal is really not my scene at the best of times, and this\ndefinitely is not the best of times.\nWhat satisfaction anyone could possibly draw from this is beyond\nmy comprehension. Every track is\nthe same, just with a different message to shout about. I say 'mes-sage' but do not for one second\nthink that Iam crediting them with\nhaving created an album to make a difference. The only difference I felt\nwas my vocal cords straining out of\nsympathy for theirs. During the rare\nbreaks in the yelling, the realisation\nof this talent less group is blatant.\nThe endless bellowing and the\ndrowning-out by drums is simply a cover for the fact that they couldn't hit a correct note were it a barn\ndoor.\nThe comparisons made above\nwith Red Hot Chilli Peppers, House\nof Pain and Metallica are not in any\nway recognition for Dredge, they\nare simply examples of who they\nhave tried to rip off. In fact, they\nare more akin to a dire Rage\nAgainst The Machine.\n1 had not heard of Dredge\nbefore now, and 1 hope never to\nhear of them again. This would get\nminus stars were they available to\ngive.\nHowever, one good thing did\ncome from this; the thickness of aCD is the perfect size to stabilise\nmy wobbling desk - no more wo b ble, bliss. ESI\nDerek\nSIZZLA\nPraise ye jah\nS izz la's second album is like a stick of rock, cut it though the\nmiddle and it reads reggae\nright through it. But don't try this\none at home, ladies and gentle-men, since it may seriously impair\nyour CD's performance. He is one\nof the new breed of Rasta youths\nwho have re-found their religion\nand gone right back to their roots.\nHis message is not concerned with\npop trivialities; instead his sweet\nvocals are laced with religious\novertones, cultural issues and\nancient wisdom from the West\nIndies. Described as a 'sing-jay',\n(no, not some kind of well-plumed\nnight bird), he produces a blend of\nsinging and DJing that is certainly\ninteresting in sound, and he improvises all the time. Sizzla certainly\nhas a smooth, pleasant vocal style.\nNot that dissimilar from that of\nFinley Quaye's or Jay Kay's, from\nJamiroquai.\nDon't be fooled though, Sizzla\nis no Bob Marley. Whilst the beats\nand rhythm of the music Sizzla produces may sound similar in nature\nthere is little to get excited about or\nget hooked on. You will not find\nyourself with that \"catchy little\nSizzla tune\" playing over and over\nin your head all day. The problem is\nthe lyrics are too concerned with\nserious issues of race, culture and\nreligion to make them enjoyable or\nfun. There are some good tracks on Praise ye jah though. The title track\nand Haile Selassie both have a more upbeat feel to them which\ncomes as a pleasant relief from the\nmonotony of the rest of the tracks.\nOverall the album is pleasant\nenough, good as background\nmusic with the tracks tending to\nblend together. This certainly is not\na must, even for reggae fans, I dare\nsay. But for anyone that wants to\nbe immersed in typical Caribbean\nrhythms and tunes I suppose this is\nas good as it gets.\nH Ramzi\nSINGLES Shed 7 - She Left Me On A Friday\nThe Sheds have gone more funky with this new\ntrack, probably the first release from their forthcoming third album. It is an excellent ct achy mix\nof funky shout-along lyrics and nearly as bouncy\nas Supergrass' Alright.\nCatherine Wheel - Ma Solituda\nThe appeal of this record is in the expressiveness and expansiveness presented to the listen-er. It is along the same lines as the epic Drugs\nDon't Work by heroes of the hour the Verve.\nlames - Destiny Calling\nHere, James attack the music industry, discussing how they and dozens of other bands\nthat make up the industry are a bunch of freaks.\nPerhaps it is a little ironic that they're about to\nrelease a 'Greatest Hits' album. So they're not\nselling their fans out in any way then.\nBreaker - Carousel\nYet another band from Sweden, along with current ones like the Wannadies, the Cardigans,\nGrass Show, and we must not forget golden\noldies like Abba and Roxette. Not so poppy here\n, but a mix of Smashing Pumpkins and Hole.\nJason\nSnow Patrol - Little Hide\nInitially pleasingly reminiscent of ' My Bloody\nValentine' but they don't build on this. Thin\nvocals and a lack of imagination make for a worthless pile of poo.\nNick Heyward - Stars In Her Eyes\nThis is good for a whole five seconds before\ndescending into a type of ponce y pap comprising dull vocals and the requisite piano. Let's just\nsay that this song wouldn't be out of place in an\nelevator....\nUltrasound - Best Wishes\nReally rather pleasant and very atmospheric with\nan odd but likeable singer. Not truly outstanding\nbut certainly worth looking into: Ultrasound\ncould well be one to watch.\nJames Iha - Be Strong Now\nAnyone expecting Smashing Pumpkins-esque\nguitar workouts are going to be majorly disappointed with this lifeless, light, country-type\nsong. It could have been written and played by\nanyone, and although lha's voice is fairly good,\nI expected much better from such a talented\nguitarist.\nDaytona - American Disco Dancer\nStraightforward puerile and radio friendly indie\nwhich uses too many clich es for its own good. Not terrible enough to slate with my normal glee\nbut hardly the best thing since that 98p Burger\noffer.\nNovocaine - Million Miles\nUnremarkable and conventional processed rock\nwith 'en vogue' distorted vocals make up an\nacceptable attempt to be dark and menacing.\nVaguely catchy for some reason but this really\nisn't very good a CJ H Martin\n\n"

This may seem\nimpossible, but it does work. I feel totally justified\nin saying this as everybody who turns up to a RAG\nWeek event will automatically raise some money\nfor the worthwhile charities we support this year\nand hopefully experience some of the best ways to\nenjoy yourself that's legal.\nWhy bother I hear some of you say? Primarily, we\nare supporting needy causes, but then some\npeople would say we students are a fairly needy\ncause and shouldn't we be out extracting money\nfrom people who already have tons of money?\nHowever, there are people in situations that are\nmagnitudes worse than ours. It's only by taking\nsome time out and really look at the world that we\nbegin to recognise the needs of others. By going\nout and making some money you are showing that\nyou care, no matter how small the amount raised.\nThe ultimate aim of RAG is to make money for\ncharity. Naturally, this doesn't happen on it's own\nand we need as many people as possible to get\ninvolved.\nRag Stock Sale At all the above RAG event we will be selling a large amount of bygone RAG memorabilia -including T shirts, Mugs, Pint Glasses.

In fact this was the best gig\nso far this year, the event really\nbenefiting from being on a Friday,\ninstead of the usual Thursday, with\nmore people watching and a much better atmosphere, resulting in all\nof the bands giving excellent per-form ances. First up were 'Snapdragon' who started off the evening with a bang\nplaying a very tight and polished\nset consisting of an eclectic choice\nof covers by bands such as Pearl\nJam, Metallica and Blur. The tight\nrhythm section, especially John's rock solid bass playing, allowed the\nguitarists to play at their best. This\nis a band rapidly gaining a reputation at college, and rightly so\nthough it would be nice to hear\nsome original songs at their next\ngig. Anyway, this got the ever\nincreasing crowd into the mood as\nwe welcomed the next band and 1\nwelcomed another 3 pints of\nGuinness....\nYou've probably never heard of\n'Canvas', but they are actually what\nwas formerly known as 'Funk and\nDisorderly', one of the most well\nknown and impressive bands in\ncollege. Their excellently performed set of acid jazz songs went\ndown very well with the now rather\nlarge mob gathered in Db's and\nprovided a nice contrast to the previous band. The playing was top-class with some inspired solos, in\nparticular from the alluring ly attired\nAmy Barnes (nice dress!) on saxo-phone. Anyway, another band and\nanother few beers. We now had the\ntant a lising prospect of ' P.O.G.' and\ntheir unique brand of funk-rock. A sort of drugged up, bastard is ed hybrid of the last 2 bands (in the\nnicest possible sense, of course),\n' P.O.G.' rocked the socks off of the\nnow scar i ly large crowd whilst giving them sleepless nights wondering why the bassist, Mark, kept\nchanging hats for every song. This\nwas an excellent set with some surprisingly good original songs mixed\nin with covers like Foxy Lady.\nWith a final\nstumble to the\nbar for beers 10\n- 12, I made it\nback in time to\nsample the\ndelights of\n'Cereal Killer'\nwho are now regarded as\n(probably) the\nbest band in\ncollege at th\u00a7\nmoment. They\nrose to the\nchallenge with a rocking, near\nflawless set of covers and original\nsongs, living up to their acclaimed\nreputation with the practiced ease\nwe've come to expect. In fact they\nwere so good1 nearly dropped my\nbeer - only nearly, mind... My only\ngripe is that they need a little more\ndiversity in their songs to show off\ntheir talents even more. However,\ntheir excellent performance was\ncertainly appreciated by the crowd and brought a very enjoyable\nevening to an end.\nI'd certainly recommend these\nband nights to anyone as the standard of the bands is always very\nhigh and it doesn't cost anything to\nsee them. It was a shame the\nbands didn't have time to play\nlonger sets and I got the impression that the bands had only really\njust warmed up by the end of their\nset. Congratulations to everyone\ninvolved for an excellent evening.\nAs for the rest of you, come along\nnext time and be pleasantly surprised - you don't know what\nyou're missing! EJ\nMartin\nCereal Killer - as good as a bowl\nof cornflakes, and just as nice.\nItalian70's pom movie sound-tracks... heard it all before, eh?\nErm, actually, no. As themed\nalbums go, it would be hard to pinpoint the original concept for this\nrecord from its content unless you\npick up on occasional background\nmoaning. Individual tracks are\nmore reminiscent of Westerns\n(Space Devils) or comedy cartoon\ncapers (Sequence Six) than tight\ntrousers and dod gy' t ashes. The\nconfusion is not even due to my\nmisunderstanding the lyrics; only a couple of the tunes feature any\nvocals and I dare say that that\norchestral numbers with names\nlike No Parting and Klu Klux Clan\nSequence will probably not drive\nlisteners into any kind of sexual\nfrenzy. Loosely, the record is jazz.\nThe range, however, is vast: from\nsleepy, chilled panpipes to crazed,\nenergetic sitar and Hammond solos. The accent is certainly on\nslower, slinky tunes that are interesting enough without ever being\ntotally gripping. They may induce a vague tapping of the foot, which I suppose (as a soundtrack), is their\npurpose. On reflection, the record\nwould probably work well under a film, although the genre is certainly surprising, although it does not\nwork so well at home on a stereo.\nSurely there are more original\nand interesting easy listening\ntracks out there. Soundtracks generally feature music made for the\nsake of a film, not for music's sake:\nin my book this is definitely a bad\nthing. Lyrics along the lines of 'Laa-la-la' may entertain Eurovision and\nclassic erotica fans, but they are\nunlikely to ever change your life.\nEl Tom\n\n"

Quantum\nMechanics is a compilation featuring some of the rising stars in D&B and will get a full album review in\nweeks to come( when I finally get a copy).\nThe End was chosen to host the\nlaunch party and I can see why as it\nhas to be one of the best venues in\nthe city. I have been here before\nabout a year ago and was blown\naway by the A I sound-system (I doubt you'll find a better sounding\nsystem in London for clarity and\npower) and the clean ' n' new feeling this club still has even though\nit's been open a few years now.\nRespect to Mr.C( of Shamen fame)\nand crew for making this one of the\nTHE ALBUM IAU NCH QUANTUM?77;;, most happening clubs in town.\nWe arrived at about 1 1.00pm. and the guest list queue was longer\nthan the paying, everyone wanted\nto be at this one and after a little\nwait we were in.\nThe place was already nearly full and Future Forces were giving\nthe crowd a good work-out. After\nbattling to the one and only bar in\nthe place, (the only grumble I have)\nwe headed for the dance floor. It\nlooked packed but we easily found\nspace to stand back and take in the\nphat beats and surprisingly friendly\n'n' relaxed atmosphere, with the sweet smell of skunk thick in the air.\nThe main room was obviously\n\u00abS \u00bbTC INTRA I ar WC1\ndropping the freshest slabs of D&B you'll hear anywhere, much of which 1 should imagine taken from\nthe forthcoming album. The second\nroom I only went into to buy the\ndrinks, which pesto| show how ruff it\nwas in the\nmain room) was playing house /garage\n/disco sort of thing going on.\nNext upon the decks was Bailey, who total rinsed out the place. I hardly stopped jacking and\nbusting for the whole two hours or\nso that he was on. And you should\nhave seen the crowd when he\ndropped Warhead, a little old but\nalready a classic. Easily the DJ of\nthe night for us and everyone else\nfrom where I was standing, playing\na diverse mix of D&B as did all the\nDJs. A broad spectrum of styles\nwere covered which made for a nice change.\nAt this point 1 must give props\nto the lighting engineer who normally don't get a mention, but at\nleast I appreciated the thought that\nplanning that went into the lighting.\nAnd with respect to the sound s ys tem; it hasn't lost any of it's edge\nsince last time I was here and it just\nkept getting louder and louder, to the point where the speakers we\nwere standing next to were nearly\njumping up ' n' down. Speakers that\nbig don't normal move but these\nwere vibrating so much that beer\nbottles were flying off 'em.\nSo I can highly recommend this\nclub to you all and I sign off giving\nfull respect to DJ Bailey who made\nmy night at least. Jo Public\nEE WAX DOCTOR\nSELECTED WORKS (R&S Recordings)\nT he latest album from Paul\nSanders (The Wax Doctor) is\nimaginatively titled Selected\nWorks. Yes, you've guessed it, an hour-long compilation of Paul's intelligent style of d'n'b releases\nfrom the past god know show many years.\nFor those of you who don't know of the man, it's safe to say\nthat he has been one of the leading\nfigures in making today's D&B music what it is, and this album\nhighlights some of his most influential pieces of work.\nCLUBSCENE - SINGLES\nEight tracks have been selected,\nand are aimed to give a 'journey\nlike' feel, also having the aura of a chill out CD. However, the album\nstill manages to deliver more than\nmost in this genre can, and it's hard\nto believe how old some of these\ntracks are as you could play them\nout today 'n' most wouldn't notice.\nThe first tune, Atmospheric\nFunk (which originally appeared on\nTalkin' Loud label) is one of the\nfunkiest tracks of all time, and is\nprobably the best example of how\nthe d'n'b scene emerged from the\nsounds of the early nineties. A fast,\ngliding beat to very intelligent\nbreakdowns make for an intriguing\n10 minutes.\nAlthough the album is not mixed, All I Need caries on in the\nsame vein with a very laid back\nfunky style. The third track. Step,\ntakes on the darker side of things,\nand could have been produced straight out of either the Old Skool\nera, or from the 'Reprazent' style\nnowadays.\nSpectrum is one of the earliest\nproduced tracks on the compi la tion. It's vocals, produced superbly\nalongside the bassline, is a typical\nexample of the techno/ jungle\nfusion often found in early tracks.\nKid Caprice, a Metalheadz release,\nalong with Heaf and Offshore Drift\nfollowing in the same blueprint as\nthe earlier tracks.\nAll in all, the eight tracks combine to make this more of a d'n'b listening album. Although of it's type, it's probably one of the best -but things have moved on\nEE Chris.\nJust a little note about the singles featured in the club scene section, firstly they are mainly vinyl only release, and secondly you will not\nfind most of these tracks in the large record shops e.g. HMV etc, but small independent record shops such as Blackmarket Rec. or Section 5.\nGARAGE\nChris Mack. Feel Good/Alright.\n(Main Ingredient) Out Now.\nFor some reason the sleeve of this\nrecord with \"Spicing up the under-ground\" written on it made me think it would be cheesy as you like. But that preconception was\nquickly dismissed and appearances\ncan be deceiving. It gets straight\ndown to business with a broken\nbeat style, looped vocal and stabs\nof acid sounds. Then rolls in a deep\nsub-bass so ya can wind ya waist.\nPowerful female title vocal and clever cut ' n' spliced beats keep\nyou interested. One for the dancefloor massive.\n2 Deep EP. Get Away/ Loving You.\n(Ripe 'n' Ready) Out Now.\nOf the three mixes of Get Away,\nthe original does it for me, with it's jigger ly beats, building keys and\nlooped male vocal. Then the phat\nsub-bass comes into play mixing it\nup and alternating with the keyboard stabs 'n' beats and looped\ntitle vocal. This all fits together very\nwell with a variety of combinations\nof the above mentioned beats.\nAlso a nice Loving you is easy remix\non here as well, it's been given the\ntwo step sort of treatment, with an\nextended vocal from the original,\nnot a floor burner but works well.\nTECH/HOUSE\nFreaky Charka. Year 2000 EP.\n(Astralworks) Mid March.\nThis comes from San Francisco's Daum Bentley and introduces us,\nwell me anyway, to the tech-house\nstyles bubbling up from San Francisco's underground. This EP is\ngeared more towards the dancefloor and I can see why, with it's body-rocking slow stepping beats\nworking hand in hand with a simple\nb line, eerie atmospheric als and\nintelligent programing which make\nfor four very useable tracks.\nShowing me yet another dimension\nof house music.\nEgoiste. Wind It Up.\n(Truelove) 2nd March.\nIn that banging house style, fast\nstomping beats, tight percussion,\nnice trip py atmospheric als. All broken up nicely with little breaks of\nthis & that, and when you think it's broken down to come back\nstronger for the last time, it goes\nand does it again and again!\nJon's mix is darker and more mini-mal, but retains a certain depth.\nWith clever use of horns all filtered\nand fucked with, and a very large\nbreakdown in the middle.\nEE Jo Pubilc.\n\n"

A word about the\nreplay system - it is simply excel-lent, with ball tracking (as seen on Sky Sports), more viewpoints than\nyou can shake a stick at and variable speed. You can have a replay\nat any time, too. The only thing\nthat's missing is an ability to save\nthem to memory card.\nThe commentary is reasonable,\nalthough as ever it does tend to\ngrate after a while. As this is fairly\ninevitable, this is really only a minor failing.\nGameplay is both fluid and realistic, although I would advise\nnew players to practice against a friend before challenging the computer opponents - but then I could\nnever play football anyway.\nThe only real fault is that it is\nquite hard to defend your goal.

    "content": "6 March 1998 BOOKS\nALAN SILLITOE\nA Haldane Collection Cultural Event\nI 've always been a prodigious\nreader. In my second year at\nsenior school, my teacher, tired\nof my finishing books weeks before\nthe rest of the class, gave me Alan\nSillitoe's, The Loneliness of a LongDistance Runner, probably to confuse my thirteen year old brain.\nUnluckily for her, it didn't put me off\nreading, and luckily for me, it got me interested in Alan Sillitoe, so when I heard that he was going to come to\nImperial to read from his new book.\nAlligator Playground, I jumped at the\nchance to go and listen.\nAlan Sillitoe started his writing\ncareer properly in 1958, with\nSaturday Night, Sunday Morning,\nand became famous with The\nLoneliness of a Long Distance\nRunner, a book of short stories\nwhich won the Hawthorne Prize.\nSince then, he has written numerous volumes of poetry, many plays,\nfor both screen and stage, as well\nas novels and short stories. He believes firmly that a writer is in the\nbusiness of communication, a belief\nthat probably originates from him having been an RAF telegraph operator after leaving school. He had\nwanted to write a novel about this\npeculiar breed of people for a long\ntime, and eventually wrote The\nFlying Boat in 1983.\nThe second extract was from\nThe Loneliness, called On Saturday\nAfternoon. It's about a young boy,\nwho misses out on a cinema trip,\nand instead watches a man attempt\nto commit suicide. Written from the\npoint of view of the child, it is really about the differences in types of\ndepression. The child's father has\nterribly black moods, where he\nshouts at his wife and children,\nthrows things about and kills flies by\nthrowing them in the fire. The suicidal man has that bleak de pre s sion, where you stare into space,\nand can never see any positiv it y at\nall, and don't even want to. The\nattempt fails; the light bulb he has\nstrung the rope from breaks. The\nman is arrested and taken to hos pi tal. Here, he's put into a ward on the sixth floor, and kills himself by\njumping out of a pane of glass onto\nthe road. The irony of this isn't lost\non the boy, young as he is.\nHis penultimate reading was about a one-night stand. This story\nwas extremely beautiful and poignant, with the couple both\nclearly feeling the same confusion\nand the same tenderness for each\nother. Set in France, and featuring\ntwo English people on the way back\nto their normal lives after their holi-days, this story really showed the\nfrailty of humans and the fragility of\nhuman relationships. I don't want\nto give too much away here as that\nwould spoil it, but it really is a wonderful story. Alan Sillitoe manages\nto write extremely convincing char-act ers; the man even leaves her his\nbusiness card with \"Thanks for\neverything\" written on it. Of course,\nhe leaves without saying goodbye.\nAfter this he answered questions on his work, describing how he came to write Her Victory, his\nlongest novel, from a chance\nencounter on a street, and the difference between his novels and his\npoetry. Novels come from deep\nwithin you, short stories from even\ndeeper, and that poetry comes from the deepest level yet' To\ndemonstrate, he read us a poem called Shadows, which deals with\nthe fear of death. Alan Sillitoe is one\nof the finest writers in England at\nthe moment, long may he continue.\nJulia H Waterstone's Competition\nThis week we start our monthly\ncompetition in conjunction with\nWaterstone's.

    "content": "6 March 1998 NEWS\nAttack of the Green Rag in Drag\nWellingtons\nDAVID ROBERTS\nAn estimated quarter of a million\ndemonstrators descended on London last Sunday for the 'Countryside March', the biggest\norganised protest in the UK since the C ND rallies of\nthe early eight-ies. They had\ncongregated to voice their fears\nthat the government are\nmarginal ising rural issues, citing government\nbacked moves to ban fox-hunting and introduce the 'right to roam'.\nMore than two thousand coaches and twenty-nine special\ntrains were laid on, delivering the\nmarchers to the Embankment for\nthe 10.20am start. Kitted-out to a man in green well ies and anoraks,\nthey carried a bizarre mix of plac-ard s; \"We Support Blair Coursing\",\n\"Scottish Terrier Men Say No Way\",\n\"For Fox Sake, Listen\", \"Let The\nCows Moo\" and\" Buy British\nCheese\" were just some of the slogans on offer. Over the next few\nhours, the organisers claim284,500 people completed the march, from the north bank of the\nThames, through Trafalgar Square\nand down Piccadilly, to the finish in\nHyde Park, where they passed under a huge banner saying \"Finish\",\nas if it was the London Marathon.\nAlong the way, the marchers were\njoined by the sounds of March FM, a one-day London-wide radio station backed by the Duke of\nWestminster's millions.\nThe marchers' main protest was\nagainst the government's attempts\nto ban fox hunting. Although opinion polls\nreflect a vast\nmajority in favour of banning the hunts,\nmany of the\nprotestors felt\nthat a ban would destroy\naway of life,\nboth for the\nlanded aristocracy who enjoy the\n'sport', and their employ-Photo: Alex Feakes ees, whose livelihood is\ndependant on the industry which\nsurrounds the hunts. As a result of\nthe march, the government have\nnow backed down, and are suggesting that legitimate hunts will be\n\"certified\", and allowed to continue.\nAlthough widely regarded as a success, there were notes of dissent along the way. A small group\nof anti-hunting demonstrators huddled together in a corner of the park\nin opposition, but without any\nspeeches from the organisers of the\nmarch, they seemed completely\npurposeless. The only serious\nopposition came from a group of\nprotesters who hijacked the March\nFM frequency, drowning out the\nofficial programming with their own\n'Hunt Saboteurs Broadcasting\nCorporation', which, in the best\ncountryside tradition, told the marchers to \"Fuck off our land\".\nCLARE ASHWIN\nAfter rumours of baked bean\nattacks and the infamous hit\nsquad, you might have been forgiven for hibernating for the\nduration of rag week, but there\nwas no escape.\nRag 9 8 kicked off with the\nForeskins; four brave souls raised\nmoney by having their heads\nshaved, as the hair was ceremoniously auctioned off to the cheering\nsupporters in the Reynolds Bar. A variety of events were planned\nthroughout the week: Monday evening started off with a barn\ndancing session, followed on Tuesday by a comedy night with\nCharlie Cheese - Man of the Seventies - met which some interesting reviews from spectators.\nOn Wednesday night the Reynolds Bar was transformed into\nthe home of the celebrities as Stars\nin their Eyes boasted the likes of Tom Jones, Lionel Richie, Abba and The Village People. The night was won by Mike( the Bar Manager) as\nMarvin Gaye. The celebrations continued with a bar extension and more strikes from the Charing Cross hit squad. The fearless hit\nsquad, donned in surgical greens,\nmarked their entrance with the opening bars of Carmina Burana,\nmusic that will for evermore strike\nfear into the hearts of first years.\nAnyone unfortunate enough to have a price on their heads was shown no mercy and copiously\ncovered with shaving foam.\nRag Week reached its peak on Thursday with the last ever Charing\nCross rag review, a hilarious combination of sketches from\nTrainspotting to an Indian rest au rant. The hit squad carried out their\nannual abductions: Unfortunate\nvictims were subject to interrogation and packed off to Wales,\nreturning the next day with missing\neyebrows. The traditional London invasion involved persuading\nunsuspecting tube passengers and\ntourists to part with their cash. The\ngrand finale was the joint ICS M Rag\nBall at Lloyds of London. Amazing\noutfits were plentiful, ranging from\nthe Spice girls (after a sex change),\nCleopatra, Elvis, and Titanic, to\nname but a few.\nThe money is still being counted and the final amount will be\nrevealed shortly - all proceeds go to Cancer Research.\nI HAIRSALON\n15a Harrington Road\nSouth Kensington London SW7 3ES(1 Minute walk from South Kensington Tube)\nCUT& BLOW DRY BY OUR TOP STYLISTS \u00a315 LADIES\n\u00a313 MEN Normal Price \u00a330\nM 'ith\nTelephone 0171 823 8968\nACCESS VISA MASTERCARD CASH CHEQUES "

We fielded two veteran teams, some members having shot clays as\nmany as four times before. We arrived expecting bottom of table\nranking and had already worked out our excuses. They involved our\nteams inexperience, sleeping in the\nminibus, the blizzards and hailstorms we had to endure during shooting and the culture shock of\nleaving the big city( complete strangers kept coming up to us and saying hello! What the hell is that\nall about?)\nAs it turned out, such excuses we unnecessary. Both teams achieved very respectable mid table rankings ( Southampton rather\nthan Crystal Palace.)

For once we were oblivious\nto the surroundings: the food court\nof a shopping centre had seemed to be an interesting choice of\nvenue foe the SUDA( Southern\nUniversities Dance Association) annual competition. Saturday 21 February heralded\nsuccess for the IC Dance team; with the A team winning the team match as well as several other\nprizes in other competitions.
