It's a shame that the\nregular type students do not have\nsuch control over our illustrious\npresidential type person. Her other\ncomrades seem rather thin on the\nground though.

The\nGoverning Body meets on that day\nto consider what informed sources\nindicate is 'a very short shortlist'.\nContrary to earlier speculation, high\nlevel sources indicate that the Dean\nof St Mary's, Professor Peter\nThe IC Union Boat Club's first\neight travel today (Friday) to\nCopenhagen to compete at the\nScandinavian Open Regatta this\nweekend. The club expects to race\nagainst crews that will attend the\nOlympic Games and the World\nRowing Championships, both later\nthis year. The Danish national\nRichards, is not a candidate in the\nrace. This follows earlier comments\nto IC Radio by Professor Richards,\nwho said that he 'would have very\nserious misgivings' about the task\nof Rector. Management sources\ntold / CNN that the task might go to\nan academic from abroad.\neight, who beat the prospective\nGreat Britain Olympic eight three\nweeks ago, have invited Imperial\nCollege to race 'because the British\nsquad could not attend.' IC\ncurrently has the fastest eight in the\ncountry that does not include any\nfull senior international oarsmen.\n(IC Press office)\nImperial College Union (ICU) held\nan Extraordinary General Meeting\n(EGM) in the Junior Common\nRoom (JCR) yesterday (Thursday).\nElections that were deferred from\nthe earlier 7th May EG M were\nfinally held. Howard Jones, who\nwithdrew from the ICU sabbatical\nelections earlier this year, was\nratified unopposed as ICU Publicity\nOfficer. Satheesh Pillai was also\nratified unopposed as ICU Academic Affairs Officer.\nA contested election for House\nCommittee Chair took place\nbetween Steven Newhouse, current\nSocial Clubs Committee chair and\nRichard Streeter, a member of\nDramSoc. Mr Streeter was elected\n'and ratified.\nEarlier elections for\nDepartmental Representatives (Dep\nReps) of the Chemical Engineering\nand Physics departments were\nratified. Stephen Graham was\nelected as Dep Rep for Chem Eng,\nand Duncan Robertson was elected\nas Physics Dep Rep. Objections\nwere raised to the ratification of\nSamir Karia as the Department of\nComputing after allegations of\nincorrect election procedure.\nFollowing a speech by Mark Payne,\nCity and Guilds Academic Affairs\nOfficer, Mr Karia's post was\nratified. The meeting was closed by\nthe chairman. Joe Fernley, at\n1.20pm. Danish Boat Race\nRoger Bannister Elected to IC Fellowship\nSir Roger Bannister, CBE, DM, FRCP, whose election to the\nFellowship of Imperial College was\nannounced this week, was at a dinner in the Sir Leon Bagrit Centre\nlast night. Sir Roger is one of four\nnames announced for election to the\nFellowship, along with Sir John\nCadogan, Dr Alexander King, and\nJohn Smith who will be admitted to\nthe fellowship at the\nCommemoration Day ceremony on\n22 October 1992. Robert Wilkins\nwill be admitted to the associate ship on the same day.\nSir Roger Bannister is best\nremembered for his world record\nfor running one mile in 1954. Sir\nRoger qualified as a doctor at St\nMary's Hospital Medical School\nand was a consultant neurologist at\nthe Western Ophthalmic Hospital\nfrom 1963-1985. He was chairman\nof St. Mary's Hospital Medical\nCommittee from 1983-5\", and has\nbeen vice president of St. Mary's Hospital Medical School since\n1985.\nAs former chairman of the Sports\nCouncil and former president of the\nInternational Council for Sport and\nPhysical Recreation, Sir Roger has\nbeen elected to the fellowship as a 'distinguished medic internationally\nrecognised for his blood pressure\nresearch', and for his 'outstanding\nsporting achievements and\nprovision of sporting facilities for\nyoung people.'\nSir John Cadogan, CBE, PhD,\nCChem, FRSE, FRSC, FRS, has\nbeen director of research at BP\nsince 1981 and is also director of\nBP Chemicals Ltd., and BP\nVenezuela. Educated at King's College, he has been a Visiting\nProfessor of Imperial since 1979.\nHe was chairman of the Science and\nResearch Engineering Council\n(SERC) from 1981-5, and has been\npresident of the Royal Society of\nChemistry since 1989.\nSir John was described by\nImperial College Rector, Sir Eric\nAsh, as 'a very active member' of\nthe Chemistry department. Apart\nfrom Sir John's role as visiting\nProfessor, BP have also paid\n\u00a3250,000 to sponsor a chair of\ninorganic chemistry in the\ndepartment. Sir John has been\nelected to the fellowship 'in\nrecognition of his scientific\neminence and ... his extensive\nservice to the college through his\nlinks with the Chemistry\nDepartment'.\nGlasgow born Dr Alexander\nKing was a demonstrator in\nPhysical Chemistry at Imperial in\n1932, and was later a senior lecturer\nuntil 1941. He led the Imperial\nCollege expedition to Jan Mayen in\n1938. A former head of the Cabinet\nScientific Secretariat and Science\nAdvisor to the Lord President, he\nhas been a visiting professor at the\nUniversity of Montreal and an\nAssociate Fellow at the Centre for\nthe Study of Democratic Institutions\nin California. Dr King has also been\na director for scientific affairs at the\nParis-based Organisation for\nEconomic Cooperation and\nDevelopment ( OECD), and\nbetween 1974 and 1984 was\nChairman of International\nFederation of Institutes of\nAdvanced Study in Stockholm.\nDr King was the founder member\nof the Club of Rome, and has been\nhonorary president since 1991. The\nClub of Rome is regarded as the\nfirst major environmental pressure\ngroup, and its membership is\ncurrently confined to captains of\nindustry. Though some of its earlier\nresearch work, such as 'The Limits\nof Growth', is reported to have been\ndiscredited academically, it served\nto place the issues of environmental\nprotection on the public agenda. Dr\nKing was admitted to the fellowship\n'in recognition of his remarkable\ncontribution at an international level\nto our understanding of the effects\nof science and technology on the\nenvironment'.\nThe election of John Smith, CBE,\nBA, to the fellowship of Imperial\nCollege has reawakened memories\nof his departure from the college in\n1989. Mr Smith was College\nSecretary and Clerk to the\nGovernors from 1979 to 1989, and\nwas immortalised by some as 'John\nSecretary.' On his retirement, the\npost of College Secretary was\nabolished and replaced by the title\nof Managing Director, currently\nAngus Fraser. The current Clerk to\nthe Governors is Peter Mee.\nAt the time, Mr Smith was\nreported to be unhappy about the\nappointment of his successor, and\nit was suggested that Mr Smith may\nhave feared the appointment of a yes man. This has been strongly\nrejected by senior management\nsources, who insist that the college\nand Mr Smith parted 'amicably'.\nThe appointment of Mr Smith's successor was handled through an\nagency rather than the College\nPersonnel Department as the\ncollege reportedly felt that the\nagency would be better at\n'head hunting a suitable candidate'.\nAt the time, the Rector, Sir Eric\nAsh, commented that the title of\nCollege Secretary was 'archaic' and\nthat the new title of Managing\nDirector was chosen to reflect the\noverall managerial responsibility of\nthe post. It is understood that the\nnew title and subsequent job\ndescription were devised only\nduring and after the interview\nprocess.\nMr Smith, who was fondly\nspoken of in IC Union circles, was\nFinancial Secretary to the British\nSolomon Islands in 1970, Governor\nof Gilbert and Ellice Islands in\n1973-6 and Governor of the Gilbert\nIslands in 1976-8. He has been\nelected to the fellowship 'in\nrecognition of his dedication and\ntremendous contribution to all\naspects of college life during his\nten-year tenure ... at a time\n(1979-89) when Imperial College\nwas undergoing a period of rapid\nand acute change in its fortunes'.\nThe Associateship of Imperial\nCollege will be awarded to Robert\nWilkins, a technician in the\nDepartment of Physics from\n1953-85. His citation 'recommends\nthe conferment of the Associateship\n.. in recognition of his contribution\nto the Department of Physics over\na period of 32 years.' The citation\nalso praises his '(remarkable)\nexpertise and originality in the\ndesign and construction of\nmechanical apparatus.' Mr Wilkins\ndescribed the Associateship as 'an\nhonour which I will be proud to\nreceive.' This has been a sentiment\nechoed by the new Fellows-elect.\n\u2014 2 \u2014\n\n"

    "content": "29 May 1992 Felix 936 Felix\nICSO - Promenade h^^^^ Friday saw the promenade concert\nof the Imperial College Symphony\nOrchestra (ICSO). It was good to\nsee a programme of well known\nworks interspersed by lesser known\npieces such as Butterworth's' A Shropshire Lad' and\nRachmaninov's second Piano\nConcerto.\nThey opened with the overture to\n'The Thieving Magpie' by Rossini.\nIt was great to see so many\nmembers of the orchestra enjoying\nthemselves, and Richard Dickins's conducting showed real Joie de\nVivre. It is a shame that the French\nHorns were a little weak in the\nsolos. I think it was nerves.\nAndrew Zolinsky performed on\nthe piano. Rachmaninov is an\nacquired taste, some might say, but\nyou can't fault Zolinsky's performance. The Carmen Suite\nwas made by the beautiful oboe solo\nin the Entr'acte which led nicely\ninto the Toreador Song. The\nButterworth was a competent\nexample of English orchestral\nmusic and demonstrated the\nexcellent dynamic control of the\nOrchestra. They gave a rousing,\nlively performance of Wood's 'Fantasia of British Sea Songs'.\nWith a little encouragement from\nDickens, the audience joined in with\n'the traditional merriment\nassociated with the last night of the\nproms.' Though lack of Union\nJacks and, I imagine, knowledge of\nthe words, meant that they got\nthrough 'Land of Hope and Glory'\nwithout the audience wailing away.\nI'm sure we were all relieved.\nFinally, we were treated to\nTchaikovsky's1812 overture,\ncomplete with simulated cannon\nshots (indoor fireworks and loud\nbangs) and church bells (tubular\nbells).\nFOB and Darwen\n\u2022 The orchestra will be travelling\nto Hungary this September. If you\nwould like to support them by\nbecoming a patron please contact\nAinslee Rutledge on X7282.\nThe Library\n/ looked into the library. For my eyes, huge oaks pummelled into\neminent, elegant folds and deep, nutty walls. There sits anger in\nthese strewn books, mistrust in untidy texts, decay in nonsense notes;\nsomeone's pious, indulgent retreat.\nand ameer schau m smouldered thoughtfully, a mind smoking behind\nit's unyielding facade and glowing with fresh invention. It's for Me!\nto smile at, to guard against, to issue sensibilities, adore and\nbastardize as I conceive, unto me, a like mind.\nI marvelled at the painstaking chaos and compared it to my own\nclutter, three and more year-old thoughts tossed carelessly aside to\nwarp and age. The leaves brown'd and layered with dead ness: It was\ntoo ideal, and in my projection I dismissed it as design\nThe motive, coy to my mistaking, but silently laughing with all\nothers, was to share. Still with absent occupant, a prison of wisdom\nwith none confined! How Hateful! Why be elsewhere? In disgust, I slammed it shut and tossed it to the floor; the dust rose like the\nloathing in my head.\nDA Spooner 1992\n'So you're back.'\nThe lepton was inhaling smoke\nfrom a strange contraption strapped\nto his side. He looked almost\ncatatonic ally laid back. It was\nsending Stress in high and higher\nlevels of frustration and anger.\n'Yes, I'm back.'\nStress was gritting his teeth so\nhard he thought they would break.\n'And you found the information?'\n'Yes, the mechanism is set into\nthe statue in the inner system\nstadium.'\n'Thought as much.\"\nYOU KNEW!'\nThe lepton lifted is lips and shone\nhis teeth.\n'The purpose of the mission\nwasn't in the target of your search\nbut what it would do to you.'\n'You've been playing GAMES with me??'\n'No, I 've been giving you the\nchance to work things out for\nyourself. How do you feel now?'\n'I don't care about ridding myself\nof the military chemicals.\nI just want to activate the\nmechanism.'\nAnother splitting of the mouth.\nT thought you wanted clear\nperception?'\ni know enough.'\n'You can never know enough to\nmake a decision.'\nT do, Will you let me activate the\nmechanism?'\nThe Inner System\nChapter 18:\nDecision by\nTroy Tempest.\n'Sure. But to do it you have two\nchoices. You must either shoot\nyourself with the truth gun set to\npositive, the setting you've used so\nfar. It will give you the clear\nperception to judge rightly what to\ndo. Or you can set the gun to\nnegative and shoot yourself, giving\nyu r self the anger drive to force\nyourself to carry it out.'\nStress hesitated before his\nreflection in the mirror lenses.\nT can't have both?'\n. '.Not possible. Well, which one?'\nStress looked at the weapon in his\nhand and thought of the effects. He\npaused, clenched his teeth and\nturned the switch to negative. He\nput it to his head and pulled the\ntrigger.\n'The only way to get at the\npedestal is by playing in the\nthunder ball game taking place in an\nhour. We're disguising you as a player in one of the teams.'\nThe rebel assistant fed him the\ninformation as he covered Stress in\na wolf suit. Stress took the data in\nwithout comment, he was beyond\nthought, his mind swelled only for\naction.\n'The thurn der ball players have all\ntaken chemicals to regress their\ngene structure back to primitive\nanimals, your team is the sector one\nwerewolves. We'll plant you in the\nteam on the way to the stadium.\nGood luck!'\nThe animal mask went over\nStress's head.\n\u2014 9 \u2014\n\n"

    "content": "Reviews Felix 936 29 May 1992\nThe Mambo Kings\n1952, the Mambo craze sweeps\nAmerica. The Castillo, Brothers,\nCesar and Nestor, come fresh from\nHavana with their dreams of fame\nand love and their exciting, vibrant\nmusic.\nThe Castillo brothers struggle\nwith America, attempting to make\nit whilst struggling also with the\ndeep passions inside them. Cesar,\n(Armand Assante), has a lust for life\nand dreams of bigtime and this is\nsurpassed only by the deep fraternal\nlove for Nestor (Antonio Banderas).\nNestor is sensitive and introverted.\nHe is consumed and tortured by his\nunrequited love for a woman in\nCuba. This comes to symbolise all\nhe has left behind and is the basis\nfor for 'Beautiful Mario of my\nsoul', the song which brings them\nto the fame that Nestor does not\nreally desire. He would prefer a little club where he could play his\nmusic as he meets his wife\n(Maruschka Detmers) for the first\ntime.\nThe images of the film are\ncolour fully intense, from the\nsplendour of the clubs to the harsh\nreality of the brothers's daytime\nwork. It portrays the passion of the\nbrothers really well.\nIn the end, the film is an\nalternative version of 'The\nAmerican Dream': To start from\nnothing, to get there, and then to see\nit all go up in flames. Then to start\nagain, having to bear the pain.

I was wrong.\nThis film is based on his story.\nJack Ruby (Danny Aiello) is a small-time club owner in Dallas.\nFact. He has mafia connections.\nPossible. Sheryl Ann Dujean, stage\nname Candy Cane, (Sherilyn Fenn,\nTwin Peaks) is a waif, a stray, and\na stripper. Fiction. Candy Cane\nnever existed. Therefore all of her\nactions never existed. And none of\nthe consequences of those actions\never happened. Candy Cane never\nmet the mafia, never went to Las\nVegas, which meant that Ruby also\nnever went to Vegas, never found\nout about the plot to kill Castro,\nwhich led to him killing Lee Harvey\nOswald. So the entire structure of\nthe film falls apart.\nWhy take a fictional story, base\nit on a real life character, who\nplayed a vital part in 20th century\nhistory, but still include fictional\ncharacters to link the story together,\nin a way that the past never did?\nThe film is also not very\ncompelling. The first 75 minutes of\nthe film drag. I thought six years\nhad passed only 30 minutes into the\nfilm. The last twenty minutes pass\nin a rush, with the shooting of JFK,\nand the last four years of Ruby's life, which he spent in a Texas jail,\nwere covered in two minutes. This\nis where the film should have\nstarted. Not where it should have\nended.\nLise Yates\n\u2022 'Ruby' opens today in the West\nEnd.\n\n"

Bearing in\nmind the facts before you, it is hard\nto imagine that so many successful\nevents could take place in the\nshadow of alleged financial\nirresponsibility' and recklessness\n(Felix 934, 15th May 1992). Indeed\nthe number and magnitude of the\nfinancial transactions that take place\nthroughout the year would suggest\nthat the finances are being dealt with\nin an very responsible and diligent\nmanner.\nYet another area in which CCUs\nmake a vital contribution is in\nstudent representation, both to ICU\nand to College. This is particularly\ntrue in academic affairs. The CCUs\nco-ordinate and support a network\nof 15 departmental representatives\n(Dep Reps) and over 100 academic\nrepresentatives (Acc Reps). Here\nare some examples of areas in\nwhich the members of this network\nhave represented students over the\nlast year: development of staff\nstudent relations, involvement in\nstudent welfare issues, introduction\nof the extension to the College day,\nstudent loans and financial\nhardship, dealing with problems\narising from lecturers and lecturing,\nstudent union deregulation and\nvoluntary membership, the lecture\nevaluation questionnaire, library\nopening hours in the future,\nmonitoring of teaching standards,\ndevelopment of study skills,\nprovision of computing facilities,\ndesign and review of undergraduate\ncourses, dealing with timetabling\nproblems, academic staff training\nand development, credit transfer\nbetween different UK institutions,\nprovision of remedial mathematics\ncourses, discussion of quality issues\nwithin higher education,\nrepresentation of women at IC,\nprovision of humanities and\nmanagement courses, discussion of\nIC undergraduate admissions\npolicy, the role of IC in the\nEuropean exchange and integration\nNend-a Bike\n\u2022 BICYCLE REPAIRS \u2022 SALES AND HIRE \u2022 NEW AND USED BIKES \u2022 ACCESSORIES OPEN: 9.00am7.00 pm MONDAY TO SATURDAY46 Effie Road, Fulham Broadway,\nLondon SW6 ITD\n0 7 1 - 3 7 1 S867 IC STUDENTS 10% DISCOUNT ON ALL ACCESSORIES & SERVICES. BIKES ALREADY DISCOUNTED.\nof students, adherence of IC to\nequal opportunities policies, the\nviability of running modular\ncourses at IC, provision of language\ncourses, and monitoring of student\nworkloads.\nThese are just a few examples of\nwhere student representatives have\nhelped to form ICU and college\npolicy, by the voicing of 'grass\nroots' opinion.\nIt would be a fair question to ask\nhow much of the C CU funding goes\ninto the maintenance of such a large\nnetwork of student representatives.\nThe answer is that it costs\nconsiderably less than a round at\nSouthside. This is only possible due\nto the hard work and commitment\nof all those involved. It would be\nhard to find such value for money\nin any other area of ICU funding -think about that when you next go\nfor a pint.\nAs has been said the CCUs\nprovide and run a vital academic\naffairs network. If the CCUs ceased\nto exist, student representation at IC\nwould be seriously crippled (if it\ncontinued to function at all). No\nother system would be able to reach\nstudents and voice their opinions as\neffectively. This is because the\nCCUs have much closer ties to their\nrelative departments, all the officers\nare current students (unlike\nsabbatical officers) and have\nrelatively small catchment areas.\nThe importance of academic affairs\nalone justifies the existence of\nCC Us. However, without the\ncommunity spirit that is a direct\nresult of the close communication\nbetween the union, the students and\nthe departments that is unique to\nCC Us, IC would regrettably\ndegenerate into the business like\nattitude already emanating from\nSherfield.\nGuilds Executive Committee.\n'it is hard to\nimagine that so\nmany successful\nevents could\ntake place in the\nshadow of\nalleged financial\nirresponsibility\nand recklessness'\n\n"

Imperial College Union\nPresident, Zoe Hellinger, reacted\nwith regret to the letter, saying that\nit was a 'shame' that the resignation\nhad occurred.\nMr Henderson-Begg cited\n'immature behaviour' on the part of\n'union officers' as a reason for the\nresignation. He later named\nJonathan Griffiths, ICU Deputy\nPrsident. and Steve Farrant, ICU\nHonorary Secretary, as these union\nofficers. He also accused union staff\nof being 'unprofessional.' Unionpresident Hellinger said that she did\nnot think that 'these are the real\nreasons' for the resignation. She\nalso added, 'I'd like to talk to him\nabout it.'\nMs Hellinger also pointed out that\nthere is a procedure for dealing with\nstaff complaints. 'If anyone has\nproblems with staff, they should\ncome and talk to me or Mandy\n(Mandy Hurford, Union Manager).\nIf a student afterwards thinks that\nthe procedures are unsatisfactory,\nthen action can be taken against the\nrelevant sabbatical.' Jonathan\nd riff it lj s,(31), recently returned\nfrom study leave, was shocked by\nthe resignation. 'We all stood by\nhim.' he said.\nIn the event of the resignation of\nthe Publications Board chairman,\nthe secretary becomes acting chair.\nThis year's secretary, Philippa\nLove, has already been acting chair\nthis year. The previous Pub Board\nchair, Richard Eyers, resigned in\nFebruary, following the 'Felix\ntheft' scandal. Ms Love is reported\nto be upset at this current\nresignation and Felix has learned\nthat she may resign as Pub Board\nsecretary.\nSpeaking to (CNN in the Felix\noffice, Mr Henderson-Begg was\nadamant that 'the real reasons for\nthe resignation were contained in\nthe letter.'\nThe concerns over recent changes\nin Biology course structure have\nprompted Dr John Brady, of the\nBiology Department, to explain that\nthe removal of courses from next\nyear's second year is because much\nof the material has been covered in\nthis year's first year. Dr Brady told\nfirst year biologists that they would\nnow have a choice from three\nfields, Microbiology, Plant Science\nand Animal Science. He added that\nsome courses will be common to all\nfields because 'regardless of their\nfinal degree, everybody coming out\nof the Biology course must have a proper background in molecular\nbiology and population biology.'\nCommenting on the lack of\nconsultation with students, Dr\nSt Mary's Election Results\nSt Mary's Hospital Medical School\nStudents' Union (SMHMSSU)\nrecently held elections for its\nexecutive. 305 people voted, out of\nan electorate of about 590. Mark\nSwan was elected president, Michel\nErlewyn-Lajeunesse was elected\nvice president with responsibility\nfor external affairs, Chris Sweeting\nwas elected treasurer and Catherine\nAshworth was elected as secretary\nunopposed.

The paper was published\nin November 1991 and invited\nviews on whether squatting should\nbe criminal is ed. The current legal position is that\nsquatting is a civil offence, as it is\nregarded as a dispute between\nindividuals. In England and Wales,\nsquatters can be prosecuted with\ntrespassing. Owners can reclaim\ntheir property by obtaining a possession order from the courts, a process which can take several\nmonths.\nThe consultation period ended\nduring the General Election\ncampaign, on 31 March. The\nConservative Party manifesto\npledged to criminal is e squatting -'we will create a new criminal\noffence of squatting, to give greater\nprotection to the owners and\noccupants of shops, commercial\npremises, houses and flats.' The\nmanifesto read 'squatting is nothing\nless than the seizure of another's property without consent. Having\nconsulted widely on the subject, we\nhave decided to extend the criminal\nlaw dealing with squatting.'\nThis suggests that the\ngovernment, or at the very least the\nConservative Party, had already\ncome to a decision before the end\nof consultation. Julian Woolfson, a spokesman for Conservative\nCentral Office said yesterday that\nthere was a difference between the\nview of the Government and the\nview of the Party. 'Now that the\nelection is over, the Government\nwill consider the consultations.'\nThe National Union of Students\nhas condemned the consultation\ndocument as 'staggeringly\ninaccurate' and 'insulting'. Imperial\nCollege Union President, Zoe\nHellinger, said that squatting was\nnot a problem at Imperial, but could\nbecome one. The University of\nLondon Union (ULU) recently held\na workshop on squatting.\nBrady told Felix that 'unfortunately\nthis is inevitable. Do we ask A level\nstudents to design their\ncurriculum?' but added that there\nwould be 'choices at every level.'\nQuestioned on the new course\nstructure, Georgina Mennim, the\nBiology Departmental\nRepresentative said 'in a way\nhaving less apparent choices is bad.\nHowever, there will be more\nresources available, for example, in\npracticals.' She also said that\nalthough the changes might seem\nunfair 'compare this with the\ncurrent second year and you shall\nsee the course has been changed but\nthe content hasn't.' Student reaction\nhas been reported as 'varied.'\n'Gardens' to close?\nThe College Catering Manager,\nSimon Westerman, was last night\nunable to comment on rumours that\nthe Gardens restaurant in Southside\nis to close. Mr Westerman is\nreported to have proposed the idea\nin a discussion document submitted\nto Imperial College Bar and\nCatering Committee.

This is the\nfirst phase of a plan to completely\ncomputer is e the finance office and\nprovide a computing facility for\nsocieties. This would allow\nImperial College Union to offer the\nsame facilities as the Constituent\nCollege Unions who provide\ncomputer facilities for their union\nofficers and societies.\nOne Union computer will be\ndedicated to the use of societies,\nwith the second being used to run\nan accounts package for the Major\nSub-Committees (MSCs), thus\nallowing the computer is ation of\ntheir accounts. The final computer\nwill be used by Stefano Ruis, ICU\nWelfare Advisor, to aid him in the\npreparation of welfare advice and\nthe creation of a welfare database.\nSteven Newhouse, S CC( Social\nClubs Committee) Chair, said 'it is\nabout time that Imperial College\nUnion (ICU) offered these facilities\nfor their societies'. He further\nadded, 'it will make the job of the\nMSC Treasurer much easier as less\ntime will be spent on n if fna ff paperwork.'\nSherfield Building.\nPlans for the reform of Linstead\ncatering are also reported to be in\nexistence. It has been suggested that\nthese involve moving Gardens to\nLinstead, or moving Linstead\nCatering into Gardens. Dr Jan\nBradley, speaking to / CNN last\nnight, said that she had read\ndocuments and that she had made\nit clear that Linstead residents\nwould be opposed to such a move.\nIn other business, the Film\nSociety presented a claim for a pair\nof 35mm Projectors. The claim had\nbeen on last year's Social Cultural\nand Amusements Board (SCAB) 5\nyear plan, but had been delayed by\nlast year's Deputy President,\nBenjamin Turner. Half of the\nmoney for the original claim of\n\u00a36013 was provided earlier this\nyear by the Imperial College Trust.\nAt the time UFC was unsure if it\ncould fund the other half of the\nclaim and postponed the decision\nuntil later in the year. In the interim\nit had increased to \u00a36750. All\nmoney to fund the claim is now\navailable.\nControversy still surrounds the\neventual location of the projectors.\n/ CNN understands that FilmSoc is\nplanning to put the projectors in\nMechEng 220 where they show\nfilms at present.

    "content": "Opinion Felix 936 29 May 1992\nBy college rules, the Constituent\nCollege Unions (CCUs) are\nfinancially autonomous, ie we can\ngo bankrupt, be sued, and held\nliable for ultra vire s( illegal)\npayments, just as any other student\nunion or small company. This\nmeans that we could, if we desired,\nget our sub vent ion direct from\ncollege (as St Mary's do) and also\nhave complete budgetary freedom\n(we can spend our sub vent ion as we\nsee fit, with no reference to\nImperial College Union, unlike\nMajor Sub Committees). The result\nof this is that, in the case of financial\ndiscrepancies, the C CU President\nand Honorary Junior Treasurer\n(HJT) would be held responsible.\nsubsidies. In our end of year\naccounts it is not specified what ball\nsubsidies are allocated to, so they\ncould be considered to be a subsidy\nfor the band and ticket excesses\npaying for the complementary\ntickets issued. In any case a \u00a3660\nsubsidy for our events which have\na turnover approaching \u00a320,000\n(less than 5% subsidy) making it\nincredibly good value for ICU and\nthe student's money which they\nhandle. The main thrust of the\nAttorney General's ruling in 1983\nwas to prevent the payment of\nmonies to political funds. On no\noccasion has City and Guilds made\nany payments to any political\norganisation.\nThe City and Guilds Union\nWhat does the\nC&G Union do?\nIs it redundant\nor is it an\nindispensable\npart of IC\nlife?

As part of the\ncredit control system, ICU have\nintroduced forms attributing\nfinancial responsibility to the\nchairman and treasurer of each of\nthe clubs and societies. This means\nthat all payments above a certain\nlimit must be authorised by ICU.\nHowever, the CCUs have not\nreached an agreement with ICU\nregarding their forms for financial\nresponsibility although there is a discussion document in circulation.\nIt is then clear that ICU currently\nhas no control over the CCUs'\nexpenditure. It is also unlikely that\nany such agreement, even between\nICU and the clubs, would hold any\nwater in a court of law. In industry,\nthe perpetrators of a substantial\nfinancial 'cock-up' cannot be held\npersonally liable for any of the\nmoney. The only retribution\navailable to the company is to\ndismiss the person in question.\nWithin a union, unfortunately, in\norder to dismiss the Chairman or\nTreasurer, its is necessary to pass\na motion of 'no confidence' at a union meeting.\nValue for Money\nCCUs offer excellent value for\nmoney, in the case of City and\nGuilds for this year's sub vent ion of\n\u00a315,707 we offered Guildsheet and\na full colour Fresher's Handbook,\n6 departmental societies, a1902 veteran car and a1926 Neracar\nmotorbike (used for charity\ncollections), 2 hovercraft s,2 active\nRugby teams (who go on\ninternational tour each year), the\nbest student Motor Club in the\ncountry (with over 200 active\nmembers, holding over 50 events so\nfar this year), motor-karting (more\nthan 80 people have been on visits\nthis year), 6 fresher s' buffets\nattended by over 700 students,\ndinner for the Heads of Department\n(where student views are discussed\non an informal basis), the Great Egg\nICU currently\nhas no control\nover the CCUs'\nexpenditure\nrace (where students from 5\ndepartments competed in heats to\nget to the final, judged by Bob\nSymes), A dinner and dance at a top\nLondon Hotel attended by over 400\nstudents, a May Ball attended by\nover 80 students, a Cocktail party\nattended by captains of industry\npromoting the college, a Float at the\nLord Mayor of London's show (the\nonly college to do so), bar nights\nwith live entertainment, a Ladies'\nlunch, a Hallowe'en Boat party,\nCarnival (for rag), Casinos\n(throughout the year), and a 'Funky\nChicken' party.\nOn top of all this, there are\nactivities such as the backing of\nGrease, which would not have been\npossible without the financial\nautonomy of the CCUs as ICU did\n\n"

This building could\nhouse 200 students at a cost of \u00a33 million.\nSummer Hardship\nOne of the bodies expected to make\nu significant contribution to the\nforthcoming Students' Charter has\nproduced plans for universities to\nopt out of current funding systems.\nThe Adam Smith Institute, one of\nthe most influential right wing think\ntanks, will next month call for\nuniversities to receive central\ngovernment funding based on\nstudent numbers. If this plan were\nto be implemented, universities\nwould be following the example set\nby grant maintained schools.\nThe proposals are being seriously\nconsidered in educational circles.\nThe Adam Smith Institute\nestablished itself as a consistent\nsetter of government policy during\nthe Thatcher years. It played a major role in drawing up the recent\nhealth service and secondary school\nreforms, and was behind the\nintroduction of the student loan\nscheme.\nMadsen Pirie, director of the\nAdam Smith Institute, said that the\nopt out plans were a logical\ndevelopment of existing\nmanagement systems. In the Times\nHigher Educational Supplement he\nsaid that 'universities have the local\nfinancial management but do not\nhave the freedom of grant\nmaintained schools. Funding them\non a per capita basis per student\nwould make the decisions made by\nindividual students the key\ndeterminant rather than the\ndecisions of a central democracy.'\nSpeaking to (CNN late last night,\nMr Angus Fraser, Imperial College\nManaging Director, said that 'the\nimplications of these plans need to\nbe very carefully looked into. We\nwould be concerned about the\nimplications for a steady state\ncollege, as opposed to a rapid\ngrowth college.'\nA24 hour duty press officer from\nthe Department for Education\nrefused to comment, asking 'why\ndidn't you call during office hours?'\nThe National Union of Students\n(NUS) is planning a series of\nsummer campaigns on student\nhardship.

In the Times Higher\nEducation Supplement, Ms\nFitzsimons writes that she will be\nurging the new higher education\nminister, Nigel Forman, 'to publish\nswiftly the findings of the Select\nCommittee on Education, Science\nand Arts enquiry into student\nhardship.' This report was due to\nbe published before Easter, but this\ntimetable was upset by the General\nElection campaign.\nThe committee made its only visit\nto an educational establishment\nwhen it called at Imperial College\non the 15 January. Members of the\ncommittee met the Rector, Heads of\nDepartments and Student Union\nrepresentatives. At the time, Zoe\nHellinger, Union President, said\nthat she thought the committee was\n'coming to the wrong college', as\nshe did not regard Imperial College\nas representative of the higher\neducation system.

Regrettably there have been\nserious shortcomings in the setting\nof the question paper and in the\nrequirements for course work. The\nexaminers are fully aware of these.\nNo student has committed any\nexamination offence, but\nunderstandably students who have\nbeen candia tes for the examination\nwill be concerned to know what\naction is being taken and how it\naffects them individually.\nAlthough there was an\nirregularity in setting the question\npaper for 28 April, students will nor\nbe required to res it a revised paper.\nOnly a small number of students,\nand most certainly from only one\ndepartment, were likely to have\nbeen advantaged by the irregularity,\nso it would put unnecessary\npressure on students to require them\nall to sit a revised paper.\nFurthermore any students\nadvantaged by the irregularity have\ndone nothing wrong, so again it\nwould not be equitable to require\nthem to res it on their own.\nThe Board of Examiners will take\nfully into account the extent and\nnature of the irregularities in the\nconduct of both elements of this\nexamination. To ensure that no\nindividual student or departmental\ngroup of students is disadvantaged,\nthe Board of Examiners will\ncarefully assess the examination\nscripts and coursework in separate\ndepartmental cohorts.

I asked a shop assistant\nwhat prices the sandwiches were -which she told me - and then I asked\nwhy they weren't visibly priced.\n'Students keep stealing the prices,'\nshe said. Well, that's convinced me.\n'Have you been here before?' she\nasked. I nodded. 'Well then, you\nshould know what the prices are.\nSandwiches are always 95 pence.'\nYup. Until such time as the price\ngoes up and nobody is notified of\nit until they reach the cash register.\nHence it being illegal not to display\nprices. A letter was written to Felix\nearlier this year on this very subject\nand nothing has been done about it.\nThe behaviour of the till staff at QT is not illegal, but very rude. The\nonly communication made is an\noutstretched palm accompanying\neditorial\nthe beep-beep-bee pity beep of the\ncash till. You have to study the till's readout whilst fumbling for change,\nonly to receive a 'tut' when the\nexercise takes longer than five\nseconds. I would like to point out\nto the staff of QT that the clientele\nof that establishment are responsible\nfor the continuance of their jobs,\nand to the managers that customers\ndeserve a certain respect. My\nmoney is not the QT's by right and\nif it is an unpleasant place to go to\nthen I won't bother.\nThe Last Issue.\nThe last issue of the year will come\nout on the 24th June. If you want\nanything in that issue, please submit\nit to the Felix Office by Friday June\nI2th. It would be a great idea if\nclubs and societies could get a short\n(200-500) word report of their year\nin by that time. It would be\nappreciated if these were in English,\nbut this is not mandatory. Any\nfeatures (with photographs, if\npossible) would be gratefully\nreceived. I hope that it will be a BIG one. There is the possibility\nthat some Felix staff will be\napproaching individuals around\ncollege to put together a 'study of\nthe human form' feature. They\nshould ask permission to\nphotograph, they should be able to\nprove that they are working for\nFelix, and they are not involved in\na spoof.\nCredits\nTroy Tempest, Declan, Ian, Simon,\nJeremy, Stef, Steve N, Poddy,\nSam, Rose, Andy, Scott, the C&G executive, Catherine, Mario,\nMarge.

I felt out\nof temper that day, owing to the fact\nthat, in spite of my morning dose\nof Kruschen salts, I had missed my\ntrain to town.\n'It's a rotten day today sir!'\n'Yes, it is. And it was a lively day\non the 1st,3 rd and 7th of this\nmonth, but the 2nd and 13th were\nparticularly rotten. And if the\nweather doesn't change it will be\nrotten....'\nHe blanched a little, clutched his\nscissors more firmly and started\nagain.\n'It's quite unusual weather for...\n'Yes, that's so.

Then came a most dramatic discovery.\nT say, Sir, I am sorry to see this.\nWould you believe it, Sir, you have\nquite a bald patch coming; in fact\nthe hairs are disappearing as the\npatch becomes balder.'\n'Is that so! I must have caught it\noff the cat. They always moult in\nthe summer. Id are say I shall be\nalright in the winter.'\n'Perhaps you are right, Sir. But\nI have a fine thing here, Sir, Cox's Concentrated Concoction of Coffee\nGrounds, as used by the Chick a Chuk Indians. Only 10/- for a bottle, and it makes the follicles\nexpand and the caps u lar....' 'What!

I remember reading\nwhat a fine crop of weather they had\nin 1733...or was it 1735?'\nHe said I had little to learn about\nthe weather, and it must have been\nquite a space of time occupied in\nremoving six hairs before he\ncommenced again.\n'Dear, dear, remarkably dry your\nscalp is. Sir.'\n'Yes, I always wear a hat when\nit's raining. My grandmother used\nto say to me: 'A damp scalp leads\nto water on the brain...'\n'Now, Sir, there's a remarkable\nthing here. If you wet the scalp with\nit, it gets quite moist and so makes\nthe follicles to expand and the\ncaps u lar glands to contract and\nexpand with rhythmic pulsations,\nand this promotes a luxuriant\ngrowth of hair...'\nThis was all said in one breath,\nbut I did him when his wind gave\nout.'\n'That, good heavens! Why I rub\nsome in everyday before dinner-stuff? I thought I was one of the few\nold-fashioned people left who used\nit. I rub some in every day before\ntea, while the kettle's boiling.'\nThis silenced him for some time,\nbut I could see his eye roaming over\nhis bottles, but he remained silent\ntill the hair arranging stage.\n'Now, Sir, how do you like your\nhair done?

Can I rub some of this cream on\nit\u2014it enables the follicular glands\nto caps u late and opens the pores...'\n'Yes, yes, that bald patch; we\nmust keep the pores shut or else the\nhair will fall out.

Or is it too late in the season\nto transplant a few from the back?\nI know it's a bit late for\nlettuces...but hairs?'\nHe looked fierce, and retorted:\n'We used to do that, Sir, but the\nman who did it was a German, and\nnow he's gone. But I can paint a few\nthere if you like.'\nThis was getting interesting, for\nhe was entering into the fun of the\nthing.\n'A little honey and flowers?'

When\nI got home everybody stared.\n'Well, what's the matter?'\n'Been having your hair cut,'\nasked the wife.\n'No dear,' I answered sweetly,\n'I 've only had it stretched, marcel\nwaved and the fringe trimmed.'\n'Oh, I see,' she retorted, T thought perhaps you'd been to the\nfrench polishers, your hair looks so\nbeautifully shiny and smooth\u2014in\nfact we can hardly see the individual\nhairs.'\n'Is that so?'

    "content": "29 May 1992 Felix 936 Reviews\nMagritte at the Haywood EuroVision\nThe celebration of surrealists has\nalways struck me as being faintly\nridiculous; profound though it may\nbe, my sensation has tended\ntowards a gleeful iconoclasm, in the\ncartoon colours of Dali, the\neroticism of Bunuel and Man Ray,\nand the extremities of Eluard, Satie,\nBreton. When I refer to extremities,\nI remain in the boundaries of\nrealism, not surrealism. A1936 exhibition rejected Francis Bacon's work as 'not sufficiently surreal'.\nI ask you. It's not what you know...\n...Am I a hero, for deriding\nnepotism? No. Heroes have\ncharacter, not trendy God-killing\npretensions that cover up paranoia.\nMagritte seems to me to have an\nuncomfortable understanding of the\nhuman condition and is able to\ndepict this with a poignancy and\nwryness not befitting his affiliate\nclich e. Surrealism isn't big enough\nfor him. Sorry, I'm a stranger here\nmyself, and I don't have enough\ntime; I know hardly any of these,\nwant to, but would hate them if I did. It is exquisite, lonely and\nromantic. They lack the vague\npassions of others, the effete anger\nand indulgent smirks. If you believe\nthis 'less than amazing attempt to\nadequately appraise Dear Rene',\ndon't waste your time going to this\nexhibition; you're irredeemable.\nDA Spooner\nA Slip of the Tongue\nJohn Malkovich has returned to the\nWest End in Dusty Hughes' new\nplay, A Slip of the Toungue. Set\naround the Velvet Revolution\n(around 1988) it is an examination\nof the mechanism of revolution\nthrough sexual and political power.\nDominic Tantra (J. M.) is a dissident writer outcast by both the\nstate and his peers. Through a series\nof sexual encounters with informers\nsent by the state to trick him into\nrevealing his anti-state views, we\nbuild up a picture of Tantra, as a man persecuted and lonely.\nThe second act is post-revolution:\nTantra has become a folk-hero and\nthe focus of new-found optimism.\nThis is where the play stumbles,\nafter a taut and straightforward first\nact, Hughes strives to bring too\nmany disparate themes together,\ncreating a contrived f ram work on\nwhich to base the play. It works\nwell on a simple level\u2014the limits\nof 'man'\u2014but to read anything\ndeeper into the play would be giving\nHughes too much credit. Malkovich\nis superb, as is Ingeborga\nDapkunaite, but no matter how\ngood the acting, they fail to rise\nabove the poor plot. A Slip of the\nPen perhaps?\nJohn.\n\u2022 A Slip of the Tongue is running\nuntil 8th June at the Shaftesbury\nTheatre. Tickets from the Box\nOffice (071-379 5399) are \u00a313-\u00a320\nand \u00a39.50 for student standbys.\nSince childhood, Gary has been a great fan of the Eurovision Song\ncontest. He is now writing a novel\nabout the love story between the\nRoman Emperor Hadrian and the\nGreek youth Antinous. When he\nconvinces his promiscuous friend\nKevin to accompany him to the\n1992 Eurovision Song Contest in\nRome, all the ingredients in his life\nare bound to break loose, jumble\nup, and lead through the chaos to\na happy ending.\nTim Luscombe's Eurovision, put\non by the London Gay Theatre\nCompany at the Drill Hall Arts\nCentre, just about manages to\ncontain the resulting mixture by\nshifting at breakneck speed through\na good many scene changes. This\nis made possible by ingenious use\nof props and stage movement. The\nparodies of Eurovision songs and\ntheir choreography are hilarious.\nSome of the scenes (ghosts who can\nonly be seen by certain characters,\na possessed woman speaking in two\nvoices) require serious acting, and\nthey are well achieved. The play\nmanages to present homosexual\nlove as just another instance of\nhuman love, subject to the same\neternal problems. I found it highly\nentertaining. Anybody who ever\nwatched the Eurovision song\ncontext is bound to enjoy it.\nMUS* EuroVision will run until June 6\nat the Drill Hall Arts Centre (Box\nOffice: 071-637 8270).\nPerformances start at 8pm, Tuesday\nto Saturday. Tickets are \u00a38 and \u00a39,\n\u00a36 concessions.\nThe Bush Theatre, Shepherd's Bush\nGreen, opens its series of rehearsed\nreadings on Sunday with 'Duet For\nOne' by Tom Kempinski. The original\ncast of Frances De La tour and\nDavid De Keyser are reading (Simon\nCallow is expected back to do Kiss\nof the Spiderwoman). All tickets are\n\u00a3 5 , but phone to reserve as it's going to be very popular (081 743\n3388).\nThe Rose Theatre, (above the pub\non Fulham Road), is currently playing\n'Shadow Of A Gunman' by Sean\nO 'Casey. Concession tickets cost\n\u00a3 4 . 5 0 and it starts at 8pm. Finally,\nat the Finborough Theatre (again,\nabove the pub on, yes, you guessed\nit, Finborough Road) Grave Dancer is\nplaying. It starts at 8pm and tickets,\nfor students, are \u00a3 4 . 5 0 . 081 373\n3842.\n\n"
