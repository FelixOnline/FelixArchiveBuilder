    "content": "Br\" \u2014\nviews\nWith Christmas not too distant, the\nTV channels are obviously saving\ntheir best (?) for later. The BBC have,\nhowever, celebrated the departure of\nMichael Grade with four new series.\nOld Favourites, Kenny Everett (8pm, Monday) Dallas (8pm, Wednesday)\nand A Question of Sport (8pm, Thursday) all return, with a new\nthree-part thriller series, The\nMarksman starting at 9.30pm a week\non Friday.\nBlind Date ( ITV,8.15 pm, Saturday) with its rehearsed lines is\nreally becoming tedious, but last\nweek's reached an all time low with\nOAPs joining in. It certainly looks\nlike the programmes are encouraging\nus to turn off our tel lies 'and go and\ndo something less boring instead'.\nAnd true to form Ms Black is\nfollowed by Ms Caine and New Faces\nof '87 Live Grand Finale (ITV.\n7.30pm, Saturday). Can anyone look\nMarti Caine in the eye without\nthinking about that cruel caricature on\nSpitting Image! Things don't improve\nmuch on Sunday unless of course the\nRoyal Variety Performance is of\ninterest (ITV, 7.15pm), though the\nBirdman of Alcatraz ( BBC2,10.15 pm) is always worth seeing\nagain.\nMonday sees another in the series\nof Woody Allen films, Sleeper\n(BBC2, 9pm). Allen wakes up in the\nyear 2173, 200 years after going into\nhospital for a routine ulcer operation\n(and you thought the NHS waiting\nlists were bad).\nOn a more serious note First\nTuesday (ITV, 10.30, Tuesday)\ninvestigates racism in Alabama, 25\nyears after Martin Luther King spoke\nof his dream of racial harmony.\nCompetition\nThe winner of last week's competition was Alistair Seymour with this\nwonderful little gem. Collect your t shirt from the Office today. Special\nmerit awards go to Phil Adams, K Wiles and Neil Boxall.\nThe Phantasmagoria\nAs is so often the case with\ncontemporary dance, a production is\nnot so much a story as a series of\nsketches based on a theme. The\nPhantasmagoria is no exception.\nOriginally, The Phantasmagoria\nwas a form of entertainment using a 'magic' lantern to produce illusions\nand fantasies of the mind. The\nLondon Contemporary Dance theatre\nsets out to recreate some of this\nmysticism. The opening scene,\nPandor's Box is a magical dance, lead\nby a two-faced creature well\nportrayed by Anita Griffin, displaying\nthe 'freaks' of the circus at the turn\nof the 18th century. The effects are\nwell produced and the atmosphere is\nbuilt up immediately. The rest of the\nfirst half of this production continues\nin much the same vein, creating\nbeautiful illusions. My particular\nfavourites were a glowing web with\na man trapped inside, a sketch with\na man in a smouldering suit and a visually delightful sketch using\nmirrors to multiply the apparent\nnumber of people on stage. Just\nbefore the safety curtain is lowered\nJfAKE\nRelative Strangers\nMaureen Rissik (Penguin, \u00a33.50)\nRelative Strangers by Maureen Rissik\nis a book for rainy afternoons (not\nadvised for exam week since it is\nnearly impossible to put down).\nUnlike many seemingly similar\nnovels, it is well written, well\norganised and even contains a nearly\nfeasible storyline.\nThe plot itself is somewhat flimsy:\nrich beautiful women meets rich,\nbeautiful stranger (male) and the\nresulting relationship haunts the\nremainder of the book. She takes over\nthe family publishing firm from her\nincompetent brother who then\ndisappears off to a drying-out clinic.\nVarious characters find their way into\nthe story through the publishing\nworld, or the stranger's shady\ndealings. The whole thing concludes\nwith a grand finale of the ultimate\ncrime brought about by the ultimate\nabuse of power and the woman\nrealises what sort of man this stranger\nreally is: actually an incredibly,\nun fulfilling and very predictable\nconclusion.\nfor the interval a human gyroscope is\nbrought on stage, although I must\nadmit to wondering how the man has\ngoing to stop spinning let alone get\nout of the contraption which was\ntaking him round and round.\nThe second half is in a slightly\ndifferent vein, with song as well as\ndance. The choreography seemed\nmuch more traditional and this was\nreflected in the confidence of the\ndancers as they went through the\nroutines. Again there are some lovely\nillusions, the music was more\nflowing, and the tongue-in-cheek\nhumour which appeared in the first\nhalf continues.\nAll in all it is a very enjoyable\nevening with the experimentation in\nchoreography for the first half\ncontrasting the easiness of the second.\nThe ability of the principal dancers\nhelped sometimes to pull together the\ncoordination of the others who did not\nalways seem as confident. However\nthe quality of the dance is high and\nthroughout the performance you\nconstantly find yourself marvelling at\ntheir combined elasticity and s teng th. M.B. Maureen Rissik herself has spent\nher life working in a publishers and\nit comes as no surprise to find details\nand phrases that could only have been\nconcocted by someone ' in the\nbusiness'. However, it is well\nexplained and leaves you feeling a little more learned in the world of\npublishing.\nThe book encapsulates many\nproblems, but the key message is\nsurely that it is possible to succeed as\na woman in a corrupt and ambitious\nbusiness (and world) consistently\ndominated by men. My feelings:\ninteresting and very much alive, but\nnot recommended to those who turn\nto Tolstoy and Dickens for light\nrelief! Despite the very cool ending,\nI enjoyed every minute of Relative\nStrangers.\nT.G. Margaret Berry\nNoel Curry\nThomas Greig\n1\n0 Friday November 27th1987 FELIX\n\n"

To take FELIX away from the distribution points is\nun forgive able, especially after so\nmany people put so much effort into\ngetting the thing out on time in the\nfirst place. No matter how many\nproblems the Print Unit has gone\nthrough, we have always got FELIX out to students on Friday morning,\neven if we have to go without sleep\nto do it. The action by those people\nwas purely a crude act of censorship.\nHaving said this, I must apologise\nto Dave Osbourne and Murray\nWilliamson for the advert I included\nlast week. I genuinely thought that\nthat advert was 100 times better than\nthe one which would have originally\ngone in. They just submitted a few\nwords on a bit of paper for an eighth\nof a page advert. I wanted people to\ngo to the Guilds Carnival so I wanted\nthe publicity to be good. I am sorry\nthat I included the snide comment at\nthe bottom of the advert, but is that\nany reason to steal all the copies of\nFELIX on Friday morning?\nLet's hope that the matter can now\nbe forgotten. I have apologised and\nDave Tyler has apologised. I only\nwish to add that if everything in\nFELIX, not only the news, contained\nno opinion it would be very boring\nindeed. My editorial policy still\nremains: an entertaining newspaper\nthat contains an independent view on\nevents around College, independent\nbut tongue-in-cheek news items and\ninformative articles.

It has been necessary to cut\ndown the number of pages to 20 from\n24. We had more than enough\nmaterial to fill double that! If your\narticle, letter or small ad has been\nmissed out or edited, I have to\napologise, but some things just had\nto go to make room for the articles\nwe had to include. No doubt you will\nfind articles in this issue which are far\nless interesting that the one you\nsubmitted. I have to make decisions\non number of pages, articles to\ninclude, where to put them, etc, on\nMonday after o on. This is why there\nis a deadline for any contribution on\nMonday lunchtime. If I don't know\nabout your article before then, it\nwon't go in. Occasionally we may\nhave a small space left by Tuesday\nnight or even Wednesday morning but\nthis is a rare occur en ce. As a rule, if you don't want your article to be\nedited down it is best to edit it\nyourself before you send it in. Try\nand keep reports down to 200 words\nif possible. If you cannot hand in an\narticle, eg Union Officer's report, by\nMonday lunchtime then please tell me\nand we can arrange a different\ndeadline. I do not appreciate people\nwho ring on Wednesday afternoon\nasking if they can have a report in\nFriday's FELIX. Next Week's FELIX\nThis is going to be mega!

    "content": "Cry Freedom\nThere seems to be some unwritten\nlaw, which Richard Attenborough is\na firm believer in, that a film must be\nat least two-and-a half hours long if\nit is to be an epic. And although the\ntwo hours and forty minutes of Cry\nFreedom did not by any means drag,\nit could have profited well from some\nselective editing and restructuring.\nThe film, which has been publicised\nas the biography of Steve Biko, is as\nmuch about the deceased black\nactivist as it is about Donald Woods,\nthe author of the two books Biko and\nAskingfor Trouble, on which the film\nis based. The plot divides neatly into\ntwo halves, the first dealing with the\nfriendship that develops between Biko\nand Woods, then the editor of a white\nliberal South African newspaper, and\nthe second with how Woods slowly\nbegins to appreciate the views of\nblack consciousness. The second half\ndeals with Woods' plight after Biko's death in prison and his subsequent bid\nto flee from the restraints and dangers\nof South Africa.\nAttenborough would have done\nwell to concentrate more on Biko's life and death, and less on Woods'\nattempt to flee South Africa. By comparison, the second half lacked\nany real tension anyway.\nThe parallels with Ghandi are\nobvious and Attenborough is once\nagain drawn to a character who seems\nto represent true goodness, hope and\ntolerance in the face of open bigotry,\nhatred and evil. However, the\nadvantage Attenborough had with\nGhandi was that he was re-animating\na historical figure, who to a large\nextent had been forgotten, and also\nthe audience was able to proudly\ncondemn the terrible crimes of\nanother generation. Whereas now a lot of the audience may be more\nfamiliar with the case of Biko, and\nwhile condemning the visible evil in\nSouth Africa, must remember that\nthey themselves live in a society that\ndoes nothing to prevent this, and\nindeed financially supports it. Some\npeople may not like being reminded\nhow unconcerned and uncaring they\nare. But it is for this very reason that,\nalthough Ghandi was a better film,\nCry Freedom is a much more\nimportant one.\nOn a purely cinematic al level, the\nstandard of the film varies greatly\nfrom scene to scene. Attenborough\nlets us down quite often with the\nforced sentiment and clich ed frames\nof a few scenes, but the prevailing\nemotions are real, and modern\naudiences now no longer fall for the\nheart-rendering departures; instead\nthey demand more realism. Although\nAttenborough's direction is somewhat\ndisjointed at times, there are some\nscenes where his touch shines\nthrough, (primarily the brilliant\nopening scene of the raid of the illegal\nshantytown Crossroads and also the\n'77 disturbances in Soweto, during\nwhich 700 people died) and the\noverall feeling of the film is right. The\nfilm does become a political preacher\nat times as Biko talks almost directly\nto the camera, which is unnerving.\n(I'd rather be shown the truth than\ntold it.) Biko's story works much\nbetter on a humanitarian level, with\nthe stunning photography (a lot of\nwhich was shot in Zimbabwe)\nbringing an added contrast between\nthe beauty of the country and the\nugliness of the blacks' situation.\nDenzil Washington has a difficult task\nin creating the saintly character of\nBiko, one of the main black leaders\nwho pushed for peaceful\nconfrontation to apartheid, into a believable human being, but he copes\nadmirably. Kevin Kline is excellent\nas Donald Woods, the liberal white,\nwho discovers that the blacks don't want to be 'let into' the white society;\nthey want South Africa on their own\nterms. There is a strong British cast\nlittered throughout the film including\nPenelope Witton (as Woods' wife),\nTimothy West, Ian Richardson, Alec\nMcCowen and most notably John\nThaw as the particularly nasty\nKreuger, Head of Police. All have\nvarying ly successful South African\naccents ranging from Scottish to\nAustralian. It is notable that the\nnastier a character was, the more\npronounced their South African\naccent.\nDespite its faults, Cry Freedom came\nthrough as a strong film and as one\nof the most important films of the\nyear. It deserves attention and should\nbe seen, for it raises issues which the\nSouth African government has\nmanaged to bury in the last year.\nHowever, it should not be over-rated\njust because of the worthy ideals it\nsupports. Although this may be the\nbest role of Kline's career it is not his\nbest performance, as some have\nsuggested. It reaffirms the general\ncondemnation of apartheid without\nsaying anything desperately new. On\nthe other hand; apartheid is wrong\u2014\nwhat more is there to say?\nN.C.

    "content": "C&G Success\nC&G Rugby have been playing in the\nU AU as an IC 3rd XV this term. The\nfirst part of the U AU was a league\ncompetition in which C&G finished\ntop of their league, not losing a game,\nwith wins over Surrey (4-18), Brunei\n(24-0) and Kent (12-16).\nThe first match against Surrey saw\nthe loss of our scrum half Graig\nAllery with a broken wrist. The game\nstarted slowly with us taking most of\nthe first half to assert our authority,\nafter which we stormed away to put\n18 points on our opponents.\nOur second match was against\nBrunei, this game was played in\nappalling weather conditions. In the\nfirst quarter of the game, we were\nkept behind our own 22 yard line, and\nall credit to the team for preventing\nBrunei from scoring at this crucial\npoint in the game. When we finally\nmanaged to make headway against the\ngale force wind, we scored two tries\nbefore half-time, and then after the\nbreak we changed up a gear as the\nopposition crumbled and a further 4\ntries were scored. We ended the\nmatch with an injury to our vice-captain Steve Holden with damaged\nribs, he has been unable to play since.\nOur third and final game in the\nleague was against Kent, this game\nkicked off at 12.30pm, too early for\nsome! After a period of prolonged\npressure against Kent in the first half\nwe scored 2 tries and then relaxed.\nAt the beginning of the second half\nour over-confident attitude allowed us\nto concede two very dubious tries,\nthis managed to motivate the team\ninto action again to reply by scoring\ntwice in as many minutes. The game\nended with Kent squeezing in with a last minute try.\nMy congratulations go out to all the\nC& Gl st XV players, who have\nplayed well and made these results\npossible, taking us into the last 16\nteams in the U AU. Ladies Foiled Again!\nFencing\nLast Saturday saw the debut of the\nladies fencing team against Kings\nCollege. It is the first time we've been\nable to raise a ladies team for a few\nyears. We were very pleased with the\nresults especially against Kings who\nhave always been very tough\nopponents. The results for the day are\nas follows:\nLadies' Foil IC 4 - 5 Kings\nMen's Sabre IC 3\u20146 Kings\nMen's Epee IC 9\u20140 Kings\nMen's Foil IC 9 - 0 Kings\nEveryone put up a really good fight\non both sides. Adam Sadler, who\nrecently achieved 4th place in the\nNational U20 Epee Competition, won\nall his 6 fights for the foil and e pee teams as did Peter Cripwell. Adam's performance was particularly\nimpressive since he was still\nrecovering from a heavy dose of\ncocktails from the Guilds Carnival.\nThe most embarrassing incident of\nthe day saw one member of the ladies'\nteam having to be prized out of her\nelectric jacket by two fencers having\nbroken the zip. She then discovered\nthat her body wire (which goes up one\nsleeve of the jacket and down the\nback) was broken. One bright spark\nof a fan cer decided to tie a second\nbody wire to the first and pull it\nthrough. Of course, it got stuck half\nway! The next five minutes saw the\nhighly embarrassed lady in question\ns or rounded by six eager lads all trying\nto rectify the situation. Needless to\nsay she still went on to fence a very\ngood match!\nBelle Vue Cycling\nCycling\nThe annual Belle Vue C.C. crosscountry running race for cyclists took\nplace on Sunday in cold, windy\nconditions. The South London\nHarriers' tough, hilly course always\nattracts a quality field of both cyclists\nand tri athletes. Heavy rainfall the previous night\nmade for extremely muddy\nconditions, and turned the event into\na severe test of strength and stamina.\nSole IC entrant Andy Major\nproduced a sound 32-minute run, for\n32nd place in a strong field of 108\nfinishers. Recent IC graduate Scott\nHeyhow achieved a creditable 33-50\n(43rd place) running for his new club,\nC.C. Woking. International tri athlete Peter Moysey fail d to start, and the\noverall winner was ex-professional\ncyclist Pete Sanders with an\nastounding 26-51.\nForthcoming events include an\neleven mile walking race and a25 mile time-trial in December.\nShould\nbe fun\nSllill|||l?i:: Woadwunners\nOrienteering\nLast Sunday's event was at the Forest\nof Dean in Bristol. Despite rain on the\njourney there and a torrential storm\nthe forest remained dry and oriente ers were able to complete their courses\nin comparatively fast times. Men ran\nthe blue course with 350m of climb\nand ladies the green course. When the\nresults come through, positions within\nthe Club will be able to be calculated\nfor those competitive oriente ers. Next weekend there is a night event\non Saturday; followed by a badge\nevent in Nottingham and a colour-coded event in Ashridge on the\nSunday. Anyone interested in coming\nalong should come to training on\nThursday this week at 6.30pm in the\nUnion Foyer for an 'O' sprint around\nCollege\u2014should be fun!\nJonnie Rotten\nIt was Wednesday the 18th. Jonnie\nTurner was feeling proud of himself.\nHe looked in the mirror and saw his\nrugged handsome features staring\nback at him. Yes, he was certainly\nlosing his hair, but then again, four\nyears of Mech Eng would do the same\nto anyone. He picked up the newly\nwashed kit, re-checked his receding\nhairline and headed towards Beit\nQuad. Jonnie was ready to take the\nIC fifths to Wembley.\nIt was now 12.43pm and slowly the\nteam drifted towards the noticeboard.\nThey always enjoyed their days out\nin the country with Jonnie or\n'Grandpa' as they had fondly\nnicknamed him. He would take them\non all sorts of trains, to places where\nno man had been before, to meet\npeople who no man would want to\nhave met before. But these days were\nalways full of fun because Grandpa\nJonnie would always find himself in\ntrouble for one reason or another.\nToday, Jonnie lent his rail card to\nGlen so that Glen could swindle 70p off his ticket (stingy g it). What Jonnie\nforgot was that Glen didn't look\nanything like Jonnie's photo. For a start Glen was not bald, did not have\na six inch nose and most importantly\nwas not an old age pensioner!\nEventually Jonnie got slapped wrists\nand got his senior citizens' card back.\n2.30pm. Cobham town (where?).\nThe whole team felt like a right bunch\nof Richard Heads because we'd turned up at the match without a ball.\nSo, whilst the other side were having\nWelay\nCross-Country\nLast weekend saw us at the Warwick\nWoadwunners Welay. The course\nwas a tight and fairly flat circuit of\n2.2 miles on the roads around the\ncampus. A below par team did well\nto finish 7th in a small field of 12\nteams. The race was won by Leicester\nonly one second ahead of the team\nfrom Warwick. An enjoyable day\nnonetheless, made even more so by\nthe fact that Stuart finally got to use\nhis umbrella! Thanks Stuart.\nOur next race is at Reading where\nwe take part in the White Knights\nRelays followed by the University of\nLondon Championships at Alexandra\nPalace. C 'mon everyone let's have a good turnout for the UL champs\n(especially the girls!).\n(Football!?)\na kick-about, we amused ourselves by\nwatching Bah dribbling with an\nimaginary ball for half an hour.\nAfter wasting early chances, Bas\nmanaged to put IC in the lead after\n25 minutes. From then on IC just sat\nback and soaked up the pressure as\nflood after flood of attack was thrown\nat them. (By the way, we were\nplaying Charing Cross Hospital III).\nAt right back, Mike was brilliant.\nPete and Jon were great at the centre\nof defence and at left back Glen was\nsolid and often sensational. In goal,\nSteve just sort of floated around really\ndoing pretty much nothing (no, he\ndidn't tip the penalty onto the bar)\nlooking very lost. A solid midfield of\nDave, Lee, Tan, and Ean (well, let's face it, neither Tan nor Ean are very\nsolid at all), and a stupendous attack\nof Bas and Bah, who between them\nhad three shots on goal. Meanwhile\nSteve was still wearing his newly\nwashed green jersey (I don't know\nwhy we bother, it's never muddy).\nTwo minutes before the end, the\ncheats hand-balled the ball and\nscored. So, we had penalties, as it was\npitch dark. So dark, that we couldn't even see Bah, except when he smiled.\nDave and Bas scored, quite clinically,\nand at 2-2, Mike went up and just as\nclinically missed. Jonnie was crying.\nThe Harlem Globe Trotters then\nmissed twice (no, Steve didn't even\ntouch the ball. They hit the bar quite\neasily without his help.) Glenn and\nLee scored. We'd won 5-3. We were\non our way to Wembley.\nFELIX Friday November 27th198717 "

    "content": "arI I\"F eat ur Africa\ncomes to\nImperial\nOne of the best bands to appear at IC\nfor many years is happening\u2014that's the only way to describe it\u2014on 3rd December as the main attraction of\nthe Christmas Party. Read on for the\nlow down on a group who are even\nnow being plugged by no less a person than John Peel.\nIf anyone out there thinks that\nthirteen is an unlucky number, they\nhad better change their ideas a bit\nsmart ish, because the thirteen\nmembers of The Real Sounds Of Africa will have something to say\nabout it. Originally from Zambia, and\nnow based in Zimbabwe, this bands\nblend of infectious African energy\nwith their own version of the latin\npolyrhythms of the rhum ba has\nmoved those other denizens of the\nmusic world, the Bhundu Boys to say:\n'Real Sounds? They're better than\nus....' High praise indeed.\nThis band is no newcomer to the\nmusical scene, and can claim to have\nbeen around longer than, say, Dire\nStraits; they formed in Zambia in\n1975, moving to Zimbabwe three\nyears later, although their first LP, Harare, wasn't released until the\ngroup was celebrating its tenth\nanniversary. The basic musical form\nis that of the so uk o us, an African\nderivation of the rhum ba which is\nthought to have been brought back\nfrom the Cuban end of the Carribean.\nThat, and group member Jozos\nexplanation, 'We are trying to play\nZairean music with a Zimbabwean\nflavour', will probably leave you as\nmuch in the dark as it did me, but the\nsuccess of the formula can easily be\njudged: The Real Sounds' residency,\nthe Seven Miles Hotel in Harare seats\n1000, and playing there three nights\nper week the band fill it to the top.\nEvery single night. For those of you\nunlucky enough to miss them when\nthey appeared on last week's South\nBank Show, this is what they are\nabout. Twelve musicians, playing\nsax, snare, lead and bass guitars and\ntons of percussion, together with\nvocals which at first hearing seem\nsimple, but soon reveal their subtle\nand complex harmonies, all blended\ninto an exotic mix - the only people\nwho can resist dancing are those who\nare put off their stroke by the\nrefreshing lack of a heavy beat box bass.\nSo, that's twelve: how about the\nthirteenth? Bring on the Witch\nDoctor! No kidding, his name is\nMashura Nzou, and in addition to his\ninterest in alternative medicine he\nmust be one of the most flexible\ncontortionists going. His inclusion in\nthe show isn't mere kitsch, either: one\nof the main pieces has as its focus the\ndeath of an entire village, and its\nmagical revival, and those who have\nseen this live will tell you that it really\nworks.\nAll in all, an amazing concept, and\non top of that they are football crazy\nas well and they sing a song about\nit. Don't miss 'em.\nThe Christmas Party starts at 9pm and there are free mince pies for the\nfirst hundred people. Tickets are \u00a32\nin advance and can be purchased\nfrom Norman's Snack Bar or the ICU\nOffice. Alternatively, if you bring this\npage along to the party, you can get\nin for only \u00a32 on the door. (If you\ndon't you'll be charged \u00a32.50).\nFELIX Friday November 27th19879 "

    "content": "Small star\nfills a hole\nAstronomy is an inexact science.\nTheories are considered good if they\nget answers within an order of\nmagnitude of observations. Factors of\na hundred are considered worry some. So astronomers have had a lot of\ntrouble with the mass of the universe.\nObservations of the motion of stars\nand galaxies suggest that the mass of\nthe universe is about one hundred\ntimes larger than the mass of all the\nobserved objects added up.\nLots of theories have been proposed\nto explain the missing mass, though\nnone has suggested that it has been\nstolen. Astronomers have been fond\nof straying into particle physics to find\ntheir lost weight: massive neutrinos\nwere one popular suggestion. But,\nactual experiments have consistently\nkept any mass hidden in the neutrino\nvery small indeed. It would be better\nif astronomers didn't have to appeal\nto particle physics to solve their\nproblems (partially because it's a very\ndifficult subject and causes them\nenormous amounts of mental strain).\nSome recent observations seem to\nbe filling in the holes. A,n indirect\nobservation of the infrared radiation\nfrom the white dwarf star Giclas\n29-38 (this is the star's telephone\nnumber) suggests it has a cold but\nlarge companion. Theoretical\nestimates suggest that the companion\nhas a temperature of about 1,200 K and is about 4 to 8 % the mass of the\nSun. This puts it right on the\nborderline between stars and planets.\nThe observation is important for\nvarious reasons. Brown dwarfs have\nbeen popular candidates for some of\nthe missing mass for some time, but\nthey have never been observed\nbefore. They are objects just not quite\nbig enough to get seriously into\nnuclear fusion. Theory is a bit poor\nat predicting exactly what size they\nshould be or exactly how many of\nthem there should be. So, now that\nwe can see them if we know what to\nlook for, astronomers can refine their\ntheories with actual observations. If\nthere are lots of them they may well\nend up accounting for a lot of the\nunseen mass that so bede vel s observational astronomy. (Nature 330\npl05) UNDER THE\nMICROSCOPE\nby Steve Black\nEditorial-science & values\nThere has been some criticism of last\nweek's comment on the state of things\nwith Star Wars. It was a rather\nopinionated piece, and some people\nhave argued that there is no place for\nsuch opinions in a page about science\n(please note that the article did contain\na lot of facts taken from the scientific\npress; Woodruff's case has received\na large amount of publicity in Nature,\nfor example). This objection seems to\nimply that the world of science stands\nentirely apart from the world of values: that is, there is no place within\nscience for the discussion of the uses\nof science. I disagree, and it is worth\nexplaining why.\nPerhaps the most important thing\nconnecting the world of morality and\nthe world of science is the\nrequirement for truthfulness in scientific work: unless scientists\nreport their results accurately science\ncannot continue.\nIt is probably not surprising that,\nin a society increasingly dominated by\nthe ethic of individualism and self-advancement, scientific fraud is on the\nincrease. Several recent cases have\ncome to light (see Nature 329 p377). Most were caused because scientists\nare increasingly judged by how much\nwork they produce, so the workers in\nquestion improved their publication\nrecord by inventing a few extra\nresults. These cases have caused a good deal of worry in the world of\nscience, because they diminish the\ntrust that is necessary for science to\nwork. Policing the world of science\nis impossible, so we have to rely on\nthe honesty of individuals.\nThe public and the state also rely\non the honesty of the experts who give\nthem advice. This trust is severely\ndamaged when scientists allow\nthemselves to be bought by particular\ninterests. The interests of the food\nindustry are not always compatible\nwith our health, so we need honest\nindependent experts to oppose the\neffects of junk food advertising. We\nwould still think that tobacco was OK if there had not been honest\nindividuals who were willing to stand\nup against the huge industry and say\nthat fags cause cancer. Where would\nwe be if rich companies could prevent\nthe truth emerging by bribing the\nexperts?\nScientists increasingly have to make\nmore important judgements about the\nimplications of their work. Scientists\nwho leave such questions for the\npoliticians are abdicating their\nresponsibilities. They are the moral\nequivalents of the scientists who used\nconcentration camp victims as\nconvenient Guineapigs for horrendous\nexperiments. Scientists have to\nbecome more like Woodruff and start\nchallenging those who make\nmisleading claims for their work.\nMore than that they have to start\nasking themselves if their work is\nmorally justified at all. Star Wars is\na good example. There are good\nreasons for supposing it will upset the\nbalance of power, making war more\nlikely. There are even better reasons\nwhy it is unlikely to work at all. The\nscientists who know this but continue\nto take the (vast amounts of) money,\nare guilty of dereliction of their moral\nduty. At the very least they are\nwasting large amounts of public\nmoney that would be better spent\nelsewhere; worse they could be\nencouraging politicians to think that\nwar is fight able. Scientists who are not guided by\nany ethical considerations are bad for\nscience and dangerous to society.\nThey are not going to be taught ethics\nat Imperial College, where\nconform is m is the ideal. So this\ncolumn will do its best to maintain\nsome sort of balance and, when\nethical issues arise, will not hesitate\nto discuss them. You are, of course,\nentitled to disagree with my\nconclusions, and their contrary\nopinions on any subject.\nRadiation\nis worse\nthan we\nthought\nPatent medicines containing\nradioactive mixtures used to be\npopular (some of them glowed in the\ndark). People simply did not know\nwhat exposure to ionising radiation\ndid to the body. Nowadays we know\njust how nasty most forms of radiation\nare. For example, when you have an\nX ray taken at a hospital, the\nradio graph er has to hide behind a lead\nshield.\nMuch of our information on just\nhow nasty radiation can be, comes\nfrom studies of the long term effects\nof Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Not\neveryone who was near the two\nexplosions has died yet, so we have\nnot yet obtained reliable information\non the long term effects of low doses\nof radiation. However, the latest\nresults are disturbing since they\nsuggest that previous estimates\nseriously underestimated the long\nterm dangers of radiation.\nThe National Radiological Protection Board has called for\ndramatic reductions in the exposure\nof workers to radiation. The amount\nof radiation exposure allowed is to be\nreduced soon by a factor of three in\nthose working in nuclear plants. This\nseems likely to cause major problems\nfor the nuclear industry, which will\nhave to spend vast sums of money\nincreasing protection for its workers\nIt seems that the more we find out about radiation the worse it gets\nSooner or later the electricity industry\nwill have to ask whether atomic\npower is worth the trouble. It will do\nit sooner rather than later if the\nGovernment privat is es the nuclear\npower stations with the rest of the\nindustry.\nComplaints, news stories and features should be sent to the\nFELIX Office or to me via Chem\nPG letter racks or phone 4642\n6 Friday November 27th1987 FELIX\n\n"

Dvar yec min g art. STOIC reply\nDear Judith\nIn last week's FELIX( Fri Nov 20) a letter appeared\nnone too complementary about Dave Tyler. The manner\nin which it was written was due soley to the author,\nCharles Robin, and not to STOIC in general. For this he\napologise s. However, what follows is a statement endorsed by a committee meeting of STOIC.\n1. At Friday lunchtime the only Guilds publicity in the\nentire Union Building was outside the Arch, and consisted\nof four identical 'Carnival Today' posters stuck together.\nWe feel that this lack of publicity is more to blame for\nany all edged low attendance at the Carnival than any\nbroadcast made by STOIC. This lack of publicity is also\ntotally contrary to a statement that Mr Tyler made in a recorded interview with STOIC in which he said: 'You\nwill not be able to move around College without knowing\nthat the Guilds Carnival is on.'\n2. We would have been very willing to accommodate\nGuilds' requests regarding the time of our transmission\nhad they approached us in a civilised manner.\n3. Mr Tyler threatened that damage would come to\nSTOIC if our broadcast went ahead.\n4. Mr Tyler also threatened STOIC just before the start\nof this term when due to a breakdown in our equipment\nthe Guilds' introductory video for Freshers was in danger\nof not being completed. Mr Tyler said that he would see\nto it that STOIC received zero funding from the Union\nif his video was not delivered.\n5. We did in fact publicise very extensively the Guilds\nCarnival on our Friday programme whilst it was actually\nin progress, giving people information on its location and\ncontent.\n6. STOIC attempts to provide a service for the students\nof IC. A lot of work goes into our programmes, both\n'Newsbreak' and 'Into the Night', and we feel that the\nprogrammes are appreciated by the members of ICU.7. We feel that students have a right to choose what\nthey want to do when they want to do it. Does Mr Tyler\nthen propose to limit the options presented to students?\n8. STOIC members were harrassed when they attempted\nto gain access to the Union Building studio in preparation\nfor the 'Into the Night' broadcast. The lift was turned off,\nand the stairs were blocked by tables and chairs, which\nis surely a fire hazard?\nDoes Mr Tyler have something against STOIC? He will\nget very willing co-operation regarding publicity and\ncoverage of Guilds future events whenever possible, if\nthe request is termed reasonably, and not as a threat.\nCharles Robin, STOIC Hon Sec.\nMisquotation\nDear Judith,\nJesus Condones Adultery\nIn John's Gospel chapter 8, verse 10 Jesus says to a woman taken in adultery, 'Neither do I condemn you, go\nand sin.' This remarkable reversal of the usually held view\nis achieved by the trick of incomplete quotation, the\ncomplete verse reads: 'Neither do I condemn you, go and\nsin no more.' The West London Chaplaincy's newsletter\ngot that kind of treatment from Al Roberts last week. From\nan issue which contained five articles on the morality of\nhomosexuality he took the least sympathetic and by\ntendentious misquotation made out the whole chaplaincy\nto be p red judi ced against homosexuals. Anyone who read\nthe newsletter will know there is a range of views on this\nmatter within the chaplaincy, and a vigorous debate going\non while people make up their mind, and in some cases\nchange their mind on the issue.\nI happen not to agree with Dave Thomas that people\nwho are homosexual can and should be converted to\nheterosexuality by the laying on of hands with prayer, but\nI do defend his right to express his sincere convictions\nas part of the debate without being subjected to\nmisrepresentation and villi fi cation. The Archbishop of Canterbury (one of the contributors\nto our newsletter) said 'the Church should listen carefully\nto what homosexuals are saying about long term stable\nrelationships.' I hope that people who are homosexual will\nalso listen carefully to what the Church and the Chaplaincy\nas a whole is saying, and not take offence where\nunderstanding and acceptance are being offered.\nYours sincerely,\nDavid Ashforth, College Chaplain.\nRespect & 1c Dear Judith,\nI was saddened to read Al's article in last week's FELIX because he had to resort to publicly vilifying me, my\nbeliefs and the chaplaincy when a more constructive\napproach would have been to have written a constructive\nreply to Chi Rho disagreeing with my views. The basis\nof our country is freedom of speech and s lagging off\npeople for their views will decrease this freedom. We are\nall people to be loved and accepted as we are and then\nif necessary for change to occur depending upon our\nbeliefs.\nI hope that from this brief episode of my article and\nAl's letter people will learn that the essence of society\nis to respect others' views whether or not one can agree\nwith them and that with issues such as homosexuality even\nmore respect and love is needed and I am sorry that Al did not see this aspect of my article. I unreservedly\napologise for any offence caused by my article but still\nstand firm by the views expressed in it because I sincerely\nbelieve in them. I hope people who disagree with these\nviews can still respect them just as I sincerely respect the\nviews of homosexuals who believe their homosexuality\nto be correct but don't agree with me and want to live\ntheir lives as homosexuals.\nYours sincerely,\nDave Thomas, Life Sci III.\nSorry!\nDear Judith,\nI am sorry for 'pissing' on Broadsheet ( FELIX784). I did not realise 'Bullsheet' (to use its less polite title) took\nitself so seriously. I 'll be honest. I love Broadsheet. With\neditorials from Smedders and side-splitting humour from\nWharfdale who couldn't? It has been suggested that next time I wish to moan I should Gestetner complaint sheets.

    "content": "Libel \u2022 Safe sex has arrived at Norman's \u2014\nthe Union Snack Bar with the sale of\nRichard Branson's condoms 'Mates'.\nThe first packet were ostentatiously\npurchased on Monday lunchtime by\nyuppie FELIX Reviews Editor Ashley\n'rank and filo fax' Niblock. One time\npop star Ash said \"I will be reviewing\nthe full range in a future issue.\"\n\u2022 Is the cold war between the FELIX and Union offices over?\nHighlight of the RCS Smoking\nconcert was the special guest\nappearance by Ian Howgate in the\nFELIX sketch, an episode of 'The\nBaron'. Seen for the first time by the\nlarge audience were Ian's infamous\nsequin ned dress and his magic wand.\nAlan Rose and Chas Jackson also\nfeatured in the sketch, although Chas\ndidn't do much acting.\n\u2022 FELIX Clubs editor Kamala Sen\nhas started receiving dirty phone calls\nand was recently offered \u00a35 for an\nitem of a very personal nature by a mystery caller.\nMs Sen was taking telephone bids\nfor a pair of boxer shorts donated to\n'Children in Need' by Childrens'\nBBCTV presenter Philip Schofield\nwhen one listener got slightly\nconfused and was convinced that a jockstrap was up for grabs, much to\nthe amusement of fellow tele ph on is ts Judith Largeamounts and Pippa\nTrout.\n\u2022 Since being featured in 'Eye Spy',\nMike 'What's a condom' has, if the\nsmall ads column is to be believed,\nhad quite an eye opener of a weekend.\nLast week the female occupants of a nearby flat offered to show him what\na condom was and this week there are\ntwo ads from Mike on the subject.\nWill Mike be seen stocking up for this\nweekend in Norman's at lunchtime?\n\u2022 'Interesting' Prof Haines of the\nDepartment of Physics missed an\nopportunity to raise over \u00a350 for rag\nwhen he refused to allow the Guilds\nHit Squad to flan him on behalf of his\n2nd year electro-magnetism class.\nAnother Physics lecturer, Dr David\nWebsdale, was much more sporting\nand agreed to a hit paid for by his 1st year Physics class.\nTHE MORON A \"Tee hee hee\", thought Dave Braincell to\nhim s tlf as he sat with all his helpers in the\ntemple of the lumps of metal worshippers.\n\"Tee hee hee\", thought five thousand\ncitizens to themselves as they searched for\ncopies of that week's edition of PHALLIX.\n\"What a complete lump of offal Dave\nBraincell is\". It was one of those occasions when\ntempers were wearing a bit thin. Dave\nBraincell had carried out what he thought\nwas a brilliantly conceived plan. (Anyone\nelse who had the intellectual capacity of a hedgehog's testicles might just have agreed\nwith him). Braincell and a group of lumps of\nmetal worshippers had followed PHALLIX editor Judith Largeamounts\naround Cheapskate, sneak i ly collecting all the piles of PHALLIX as they\nwere distributed. Unfortunately, Largeamounts and the PHALLIX staff were\nextremely cross when they found out what Braincell had done.\n'**\u2022* *** Braincell', said Largeamounts.\n'**** *** Braincell', said Cwis Media.\n<\u2022\u2022*.\u00ab *** Brainceil', said Willhebe Goodforacolumninch.\n'Crumbs', said Pippa Trout.\nIt had been one of those weeks when most of the PHALLIX staff had\nlost a lot of sleep producing PHALLIX, and this probably made it difficult\nfor them to see the humour in a group of demented morons hiding every\ncopy and preventing all the citizens from reading it.\nBraincell was very sensitive about his public image. He had been very\nupset by a story in PHALLIX. The story had said that Braincell and his\nfollowers had not organised enough publicity for their Rug party. Braincell\nknew that this was a load of rubbish: there were two posters prominently\ndisplayed behind Braincell's altar in the lumps of metal worshippers temple.\nObviously anyone who came in to the temple and could put up with\nBraincell drivelling on about square bashing would know all about the Rug\nparty. Braincell was quite sure that PHALLIX was out to get him: every\ntime he made a complete arse hole of himself, PHALLIX would print the\nsame old drivel about what a complete arse hole he was.\nAfter a few hours the PHALLIX staff had calmed down enough to start\nwork on the next week's issue of PHALLIX. Thinking that Braincell was\nfeeling a little hard done by, they decided to print a special message just\nfor him:\nTHE BARON'S PRINTING SERVICES From the PHALLI X sweatshop, a service especially tailored to suit your\nneeds. Yes, if your name is Dave Braincell then read on. You have an\nissue of Lumsofmetalsheet to get printed? Then we can certainly help! Yes,\nwith the 'Baron's printing service' your artwork will be prepared for the\npresses as soon as it is delivered. After printing, folding and collating we\ncan cut out the middle man and throw the whole lot straight into the bin!\nSpare everyone the labour of stealing all the copies, and bypass the reader\ncompletely!\nWe think you'll agree, it's unbeatable value.\nIssued on behalf of the 'Why should we bother' Commission.\nThe PHALLIX staff contented themselves with the thought that if\nBraincell ever tried the trick again he would be spending a few weeks\nin the slammer.\nWhy does Braincell wear a condom on his head?\nWho the hell voted for him anyway?\nWhose genitals will be nailed to his forehead if he picks up more than\none copy of PHALLIX next week?\nYou shouldn't need to wait to find out in the next episode of 'the Baron\nof Cheapskate'.\n\u2022 Is 2nd Lt Dave Tyler taking up a new hobby truly reflective of his\nmature outlook on life?\nSpotted in the Guilds' office this\nweek were the essential pieces of\nequipment necessary for his latest\npassion\u2014a Subbuteo set and Dave's favourite team. Also spotted in the\nvicinity of the Guilds' store were two\nnew cars for the Motor Club's Scalextric Champio/is hip(!). Isn't it\namazing what a university education\ncan do to your mental age?\n\u2022 Ex RCSU hack Dai Head intended\nto take part in the RCS Motor Club's Godiva Run last weekend but was\nsponsored \u00a360 to keep his clothes on.\nr/://://N College Refectories Manager Rob\nNorthey has purchased a washing\nmachine to clean the polystyrene\nburger containers in the QT Snack\nBar, it was announced on Monday.\nThe move comes as part of a Collegewide drive to increase conservation\nawareness amongst staff and students.\nRob Northey told FELIX that the\nmachine will enable the containers to\nbe recycled, leading to a reduction in\nthe ozone layer damage caused by\nvolatile fluorocarbons in new containers. He also pointed out that\nthe machine would save the\nrefectories \u00a3100 per annum. 'It's a jolly good idea' commented Dr Krippen of Physics 'this move will\nreduce the ozone depletion rate by\n10\"1 0\nmolecules per second'.\nFELIX Friday November 27th19875 "

Catnapping\nStudents who paid 20p for a copy of FELIX when they were sold for Rag\nat the Smoking Concert must have felt very pleased with themselves on\nFriday morning. By that time the paper was in very short supply. Members\nof Guilds Union had stolen three thousand copies from the distribution\npoints. After tense discussions between FELIX Editor Judith Hackney,\nGuilds President David Tyler and Guilds Vice President Tanya Maule,\nall the FELIXs were returned to the usual sites.\n, l_j i Caught in the act\nThe 'raid' was organised by Mr Tyler as a protest against material\npublished in last week's FELIX and\nin other recent editions. Mr Tyler felt\nthat some news stories concerning\nGuilds Union had not been reported\nfairly. In his opinion, the story about\nthe theft of Dramsoc's ladder had\nincorrectly implied that the ladder had\nbeen stolen by Guilds. He was also\nupset that last Friday's FELIX had\nPutting them back\nattacked the organisation of Guilds\nCarnival and carried advertising\nwhich he thought would discourage\nstudents from attending. Mr Tyler felt\nthat this was in contravention of a ICU Council ruling, which states that\nRag events should receive priority.\nThe FELIX Editor is, however,\nentirely independent of Council.\nMiss Hackney first noticed the\ndisappearance of most of last week's FELIX s when she returned to the\nHuxley building to deliver some\nadditional copies. She was told by the\nHuxley messenger that the FELIX s had been removed by two students.\nSuspecting a Guilds Rag stunt, Miss\nHackney and FELIX staff member\nAdrian Bourne surreptitiously took\nphotographs of two Guilds students\nas they removed copies of the paper\nwhich had been left in the Department\nof Electrical Engineering. When\nchallenged over the disappearance of\nFELIX, Mr Tyler admitted that\nGuilds Union was responsible, but\nsaid that the raid could not be\nconsidered to be theft. He stressed\nthat it was intended chiefly to avoid\nany detrimental publicity for Carnival. After stating his grievances,\nMr Tyler agreed to replace the\nmissing copies of FELl X, on the\ncondition that FELIX donated \u00a320 to\nRag. This request was refused, but all\nthe missing copies of FELIX were\nlater returned on the instruction of\nMiss Maule. FELIX was in full\ncirculation by 11.00am. The removal of nearly an entire\nprint run of FELIX has caused bad\nfeeling in the FELIX Office. Many\nstaff members had spent the whole of-Wednesday night working to get the\nedition ready for press. When FELIX is not distributed until after Friday\nmorning's lectures have begun, it has\ngenerally been found that not all\nstudents are able to collect copies.\nThe situation appears to have been\ncontinued on back page, column 1\nTHE NEWSPAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE UNION "

    "content": "Letters J4j\nIndigestion\nDear Judith,\nJust a quick note, having read the Handbook this year,\nand also last week's copy of FELIX. An article on the\nback page of the said FELIX, entitled 'Yummie!', goes\non about Mr Jardine's new 'adventurous' menu, forgetting\nthe fact that such food was on sale all summer, at my own\nsuggestion and instigation.\nThe Handbook article about the Snack Bar reads like\nthe libretto of an oratorio, singing Mr Jardine's praises\nas if he were some kind of culinary god!\nWhilst not berating Mr Jardine's efforts on the catering\nfront, I do feel that the hard-working casual, temporary\nand full-time staff deserve to be given a few words of\npraise now and again.\nThe friendliness and usual prompt it ude of the service,\nas well as the laughs it affords to many customers, rather\nthan the boring impersonal service available in other\nCollege outlets, is due exclusively to these staff, without\nwhom the place would never survive and would be a lot\nless interesting. So less about Mr Jardine and his pedestal\nand more about the dedicated staff, who are, after all, just\nstudents like you and are hopelessly underpaid.\nYours sincerely,\nPete Hartley, ex-Snack Bar casual, ex-Temporary\nCatering Supervisor, Union Barman, ICU.\nSelfish and\nstupid fl anning Dear Judith,\nI write to protest about being flan ned without warning,\non the Thursday of the Rag Week, just before going into\nan afternoon laboratory session and also about the\nbehaviour of the C&G Union president towards me the\nfollowing day. I was unaware that fl anning was going on\nthat week, and that one could buy one's way out of being\nflan ned, or get a protective badge if one wore contact\nlenses. I don't know who paid for me to be flan ned, or\nwho actually carried it out.\nI fully support charity activities which do not involve\nthe risk of someone being harmed but a person might be\nunable to cope with being flan ned for any number of\nreasons. He might have ear trouble for example, a friend\nof mine told me that if he were flan ned, his nose would\nbleed very badly, since it bleeds when under the slightest\npressure. Fortunately, my eyes were not harmed by the\nfl anning, but for all I knew at the time, they could have\nbeen. I had major surgery done on my eyes this year. I always treat any substance which might come into contact\nwith the eyes with caution, just in case it causes irritations\nwhich might hinder the recovery of my eyes. I wear plastic\nlens glasses which are very easily scratched. They are\ndelicate and expensive. The fl anning could have meant\nbuying new glasses or repairing the present ones. For a short-sighted person, to have one's glasses smeared up\nis in itself a traumatic experience. Walking to a place to\nwash glasses might in itself be difficult. Also, if I had\nhad to play in a concert that day, it would have been very\ninconvenient having shaving cream all over my head. I would have had to have gone back to International Hall\nto get showered and change my clothes.\nFlanning someone who has not personally been warned\nby the flan ner s beforehand and given the opportunity to\nsay no is unacceptable, and very selfish of the flan ner s who only think of the laugh they will get out of it, rather\nthan the problems it might cause to the victim.\nI went to the C&G Union Office the following Friday\nto complain about this. Some people there, but not the\npresident, were courteous and apologised about the\nincident, although I disagree with their excuse for the\nfl anning. The excuse was that as much publicity about the\nRag Week was displayed as possible and that it was my\nresponsibility to find out about it. This excuse is as\nridiculous and unacceptable as that of a motorist who says\nhe is not responsible for running down someone who was\nin his way, because he told the public beforehand that he\nwas not responsible for running down people who got in\nhis way, and that it was up to the unfortunate person to\nfind out about this. The people in the office said that it\nwould be too much effort to inform everyone, personally,\nbeforehand about the fl anning. It is hardly any extra effort,\non the part of the flan ner s, to ask their victim before he\nis flan ned whether or not he can cope with it. This might\nsave a lot of ill-feeling.\nThe C&G Union president was very discourteous to me,\nsaying 'I don't have time to talk to people like you.. .leave\nthis office.. .turn your back around and walk through the\nslit in the wall\". He did not apologise for the incident.\nHis behaviour did not befit that of a union president. He\nshould be setting an example of courteous behaviour to\nall students. Is C&G Union becoming a fascist organisation\nwhich will not hear people complaining, without being\ntold to leave the office? What may be a joke for a person\nwith healthy eyes may have a frightening effect on\nsomeone who has already experienced encroaching\nblindness and is concerned about protecting his eyes.\nYours,\nIgor N Dyson, Mech Eng I. Biased attitude\nDear Judith,\nI am writing to point out what seems to be a rather\ncurious statement by Bill Goodwin in his article 'Is FELIX biased?'. Earlier this week, Bill telephoned me and asked\nif Ian Howgate had been quoted out of context concerning\nthe Freshers' Week entertainments. I told him that I was\nnot prepared to offer an opinion, but that he was welcome\nto come and listen to the tapes. As far as I have been able\nto ascertain, he has not listened to any tapes at IC Radio,\nand certainly not to the tapes that were broadcast, as only\nI know where these are kept. In the light of this, phrases\nsuch as 'In fact, listening to the tape' seem rather peculiar.\nThe two tapes that made up the interview were broadcast\nin the first weeks of term, and have not been put out since.\nWithout going into details of whether or not Ian was quoted\nout of context, it seems to me that a conscious effort has\nbeen made to show that FELIX is biased. Surely this shows\nrather a biased attitude on the part of Bill Goodwin? Had\nBill contacted me in person, I would have been more than\nhappy to let him hear the broadcast tapes; all the News\nDepartment interviews are kept, and anyone is free to\ncome and listen to them after they have been broadcast.\nI hope that this letter will clear up any confusion that may\nhave arisen as a result of Bill's article.\nYours sincerely,\nNigel Whitfield, News Editor, Imperial College Radio\nSmall Ads ANNOUNCEMENTS\n\u2022 Wanted: Union van drivers for the Soup\nRun.

    "content": "News Housing Benefit after\nApril 1988\nIn April 1988 the Social\nSecurity Act 1986 will\ncome into force,\nintroducing fundamental\nchanges to the whole\nsocial security system,\nincluding the Housing\nBenefit on which students\nare so reliant. College\nWelfare Advisor Linda\nSimmons tries to explain...\nFirst the good news: there is at\npresent no proposal to abolish\nHousing Benefit for students. So most\npeople receiving benefit before April\n1988 will continue on benefit after\nApril, but the amount paid will be\nless.\nOne of the purposes of the new\nrules is to 'unify' the way help is\ngiven for housing costs for all\nclaimants. At present the rules for\neligibility to Housing Benefit are\ndifferent for those claiming\nSupplementary Benefit and those who\nclaim Standard Housing Benefit from\nthe appropriate local authority. Most\nstudents are in the second category\nand claim during term time and short\nvacations.\nIn April 1988 Supplementary\nBenefit will disappear, to be replaced\nby Income Support. The basis for\nassessing the amount of Housing\nBenefit will be the same as that used\nfor assessing Income Support.\nTherefore, as the rules for Income\nSupport treat under-25s less\nfavourably than those over 25, most\nstudents will have housing b ne fit assessed under these less favourable\nrules. Another change is that a full\nrate rebate will no longer be possible.\nUnder the new rules the maximum\nUlUtravel\nallowed will be 80% of the eligible\nrates. There will be some adjustment\nto allow for this in the amount of\nIncome Support, but for those\nreceiving Housing Benefit alone, it\nwill mean a reduction in allowable\nrebate.\nThe amount deducted from the\neligible rent for students will also\napply (currently \u00a317.80 in London).\nIn fact almost all the special rules\nwhich relate to calculating student\nHousing Benefit will be carried over\ninto the new Scheme (eg treatment of\ngrants and covenants, eligibility of\noverseas students etc).\nThe table below gives some\nexamples of the possible effect. The\nfigures are reproduced just as a guideline\u2014the Government has not\nyet announced the exact figures which\nwill apply in April 1988, only\nsuggested examples which have been\nused in the calculations.\nFor the first time a capital cut-off\nis going to be introduced to assess\neligibility to Housing Beneift. Under\nthe present scheme only interest or\nother income earned from savings is\ntaken into account. The capital cutoff for Housing Benefit and Income\nSupport will be \u00a36000 with a reduction made to entitlement on any\ncapital between \u00a33000 and \u00a36000. As with the present rules on\nSupplementary Benefit, any capital\nless than \u00a33000 will be disregarded.\nThe last time major changes to the\nHousing Benefit system were\nintroduced was April 1983. The result\nwas utter chaos in local authorities\neverywhere. This time, the changes\nare in many ways even greater. Local\nauthorities face an additional\nworkload and have little extra time to\nprepare for the changeover. It also\nlooks as if they will not be given\nenough money to set up the new\nsystem. It could well be that similar\nproblems as those experienced in\n1983 could be repeated, with massive\ndelays and serious administrative\nerrors contributing to claimants'\nmisery.\nSo be on your guard if you claim\nHousing Benefit after April 1988 and\ndon't receive when you expect them.\nCheck at once with your local\nauthority or come and see me. The\nsame applies if you are unsure about\nanything to do with Housing Beneift\nor any other benefit.\nThe system is horrendously\ncomplex and I 'll always do my best\nto try to make the intricacies clearer.\nI'm available at 15 Princes Gardens,\nMonday to Friday, 10am to 2.30pm, extent ion3604.11 Estimated levels of Housing Benefit before\n\u2022 and after l st April 1988\nThe calculations assume:\n\u2022 A single student, under 25, with a standard grant and no other income.\n\u2022 Three, ten-week terms and two, four-week short vacations.\n\u2022 The level of Income Support for a single person under 25 to be set at \u00a325\nfrom l st April 1988.\n\u2022 The student's eligible rent is not less than the rent element.\n\u2022 The figures are for London only.\n\u2022 All figures are weekly.\n\u2022 Worldwide flights on quality airlines\n\u2022 Special fares for students and academics\n\u2022 European trains and short breaks\n\u2022 Overland tours and holidays\n\u2022 Group bookings\nUnbeatable prices \u2014 unbeatable quality\nEnquiries and Bookings:\nEuropean 01-581 8233\nIntercontinental 01-581 1022\nIU LU Travel\nS her field Building Imperial College Prince Consort Road London SW7.\nA service of\n_\n_\n1\nTheWoridbeaters\nEligible Standard HB HB Weekly\nrent* up to 31.3.88 after 1.4.88 loss\n\u00a3 \u00a3 \u00a3 \u00a3\n18 .20 Nil .20\n20 2.20 Nil 2.20\n22 4.20 Nil 4.20\n24 6.20 Nil 6.20\n26 8.20 2.13 6.07\n28 9.56 4.13 5.43\n30 10.76 6.13 4.63\n32 11.96 8.13 3.83\n34 13.16 10.13 3.03\n36 14.36 12.13 2.23\n38 15.56 14.13 1.43\n40 16.76 16.13 .63\nNB Eligible Rent equals full rent paid minus rates elements (if not known\n30% of total rent) minus amounts for any gas or electricity included in the\nrent (maximum deductions approximately \u00a37 per week).\nFELIX Friday November 27th19873 "

Over 500 visitors are\nexpected to attend and will be guided\nin small groups by undergraduate\nstudents through displays of\nundergraduate project work.\nAdmissions tutors, careers advisors,\nand other academic staff will be\navailable to discuss the different\ndegree courses on offer and career\npaths open to graduates.\nAn integral part of the day will be\nan exhibition supported by 30\norganisations who are associated with\nsubject areas within the degree course\nor who may be future employers. This\nexhibition will be held within a large\nheated marquee covering over 400\nsquare metres of the concrete\nwalkway outside and adjacent to the\nRS M and Electrical buildings.\nParticular effort has been devoted to\ngive this aspect of a professional\natmosphere and will be open\nthroughout the day to visitors and to\nall students of Imperial College who\nwish to confer with the organisations\npresent.\nVisiting school staff and staff\nmanning the main exhibition will be\ninvited to a buffet lunch hosted by\nmembers of the academic staff of the\nthree departments.\nIn addition to the main exhibition\narea there will be two static exhibits\nlocated in the roadway outside the\nentrance to the Royal School of Mines\nin Prince Consort Road. Volvo BM( UK) will be providing a30 tonne\nRock Shovel and Mineral Contract\nServices will be providing a25 tonne\nDump Truck. These exhibits will be\navailable throughout the day for\nvisitors to examine.\nAll students are invited. Be there!\nPeter G Darling, Mining III.\nINSEAD-Providing\n'significant upward mobility'\nIN SEA D is the largest and the most\ninternational of the European\npostgraduate business schools.\nTwenty-seven years old it is situated\nin Fontainebleau just outside of Paris.\nStudents come in two classes for the\none year MBA \u2014 1 5 0 starting in\nSeptember and another 150 in\nJanuary. The UK and France each\nprovide about a quarter of the\nstudents, with another 25% from\nother European countries, 12% from\nCanada and the United States, with\nthe remainder from the rest of the\nworld.\nEntry is very competitive with an\nacceptance rate of about 1:6. French\nis an entry and German an exit\nrequirement although little teaching\nis done in the former and none in the\nlatter. Work experience is virtually a prerequisite with the average age\nbeing around 28.\nIt is private and seems initially\nexpensive. The average IC student's first year out salary would just cover\nthe fees. But unlike a lot of MBA programmes, eg London Business\nSchool, it is one year only. Banks are\nwilling too to finance students at very\nlow interest rates. Why? IN SEA D graduates end up not only usually\nwith significant upward mobility in\ncareer and change of direction if\nwanted, but along with that a sharp\nboost in salary.\nEngineers make up about 30% of\nthe recruitment so IC grads would not\nfeel alone. They would even find a few IC people there \u2014 A la Sawistowska, BSc 1978, won a Cosmopolitan award to go to\nFontainebleau last year.\nBecause of the work experience\nrequirement, IN SEA D is not\nimmediately accessible to IC undergrads. But it might be worth\nhearing on site about something for\nthe future.\nBUFFET BAR\nBP EXPLORATION STAFF\nwill talk informally about\nPETROLEUM ENGINEERING and the openings in this field for\nEngineering, Mathematics & Physics graduates\non\nWednesday 2nd December 1987 at 5.30 p.m. in\nTHE ANTE ROOM, SHERFIELD BUILDING\n'Petroleum Engineers are concerned with a wide range of oilfield operations, from\nidentifying and appraising new prospects to maxim ising the economic recovery of\noil (or gas) from producing fields. Their work can range from practical operating\nmethods to sophisticated software simulation.'\nFELIX Friday November 27th19877 "
