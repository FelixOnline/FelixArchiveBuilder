You must understand the meaning of this simple geometry?\nWhen I was studying at university, this was as axiomatic as s peach. Sire, why did st elect to take the tutor's role? They say that this is not a well paid prof es sion.\nAlas, that is something upon which I have mused for a long time no. Tis a long story and\nit all began whence I fell in love with the Duke's daughter, Arianne. It is a worthy tale, sit\nround all and I shall tell ye.\n[A lawn with Antonio cursing the Fates]\nAh, far and wide have my troubles grown. I am betwixt two concerns so stuck that I have\nno course of escape. Not only have the Fates decreed that I must under a devilish canopy\nmy final tests suffer thus inducing my senses to a horrible beating from dainty flowers on\naccount of their dust and from the seasons and their heat and rain; but I must also suffer\nmy love for the fair Arianne whom to me is like a star to a astrologer or the book to a student. A thing of desire so great that I study her soft face as if it were imprinted upon\nmy brain. Would my good friend Giovanni were here to calm my fever'd mind, to put my\nsickly form to a peaceful rest.\nBut ho, who is this?\n[Scorchio enters]\nAh, 'tis Scorchio. a man that hath given\nme his previous wrath.\nAntonio, the hate I bear thee can have no term that is utter able. Get ye gone sir rah! Fly back to thy nest across the royal fields, man-vulture!\nIf thou will st, Antonio, I will duel thee here! The injuries thou hast done me are without\nother recompense.\nYou shall be unto us melded - unified into a whole. That is, thus, your advantage and our\ngrievance.\nFie! Speak to me no longer! Draw if you are not a coward!\n[Antonioparries Scorchio's lunge.\nGiovanni enters]\nHow now, Giovanni?\nAntonio my friend. And who is this? Scorchio! Art thou not a physician from across\nthe spacious royal fields?\nThat I am.\nAnd what is your business here?\nI am here to confront your friend Antonio, though it is no business to be here.\nThat would reason why your rapier is thus drawn. But tell me Scorchio, what has your\nmind so vex'd that you must upon Antonio relinquish your anger? Can it be that he has\ninjured you in some way and you are unable to perform your duties?\nNay, the reason is far more awful. I have from my allies heard that he has his affections\nunto fair Arianne fix'd. Arianne is mightily worth his affection. She is fair and lovely, a true beauty amongst the\nrough cattle that dominate these parts.\nIndeed, sir. I come to challenge Antonio for her favour.\nThou art affected by her also?\nYea, 'tis true. But enough sentiment. Come, wretch, and fight.\n[Scorchio raises his blade again]\nScorchio, away, be gone! I have no time for your bickering. I must my finals in yonder\ntent sit.\nShame on you coward, I shall return. But know this: Arianne shall be mine - thou can st erase her visage from your memory. Hah. I am away!\n[Scorchio exits]\nGiovanni, what a to do! If I am to pursue my love for Arianne, I am surely dead! If I do\nnot then I must in eternal longing remain.\nFear not, dear friend. Michelangelo has intervened on your behalf. He has talked with\nthe lovely Arianne and arranged with her a tryst upon which you must decide.\n\n"

    "content": "2 NEWS FELIX WEDNESDAY 1 8 TH TUNE\nBookstore battle rages on\nNEWS TEAM Imperial College Union's battle for\ncompensation from the College for\nthe loss of the bookstore trading revenue continued last week with with a meeting between representatives of\nthe Union and the College. The\nUnion is lobbying for an increase in\nits annual sub vent ion from the\nCollege to make good the loss of the\nretail outlet's profits.\nThe Rector has commited the\nCollege to \"ensure that the Union\nfinances would be no less healthy\nthan if the existing ICU bookshop\nhad continued to trade.\" However, a casual remark about the recompense\nby the College's Director of Finance,\nMike Hansen, triggered alarm bells\nin the Union administration that they\nare likely to be given too little. Mr\nHansen later confirmed his comment,\nan offer of an additional \u00a320,000 per\nannum for the Union, in an e mail to\nthe Deputy President for Finance and\nServices, Piers Williams.\nIt is the method of calculation of\nthis sum that has brought the matter\ninto dispute. Under the Union's own\nre im burs ment model, the bookstore\nwould have ache i ved profits of\naround \u00a330,000 per annum, but\nwould want an additional \u00a310,000 in\nthe first year to cover incidental costs\nlike restructuring and the loss on selling stock to Waterstone's, the new\nbooksellers on campus.\nIn reply, a letter from Alan\nSwanson, the Pro-Rector for\nEducational Quality, reiterated the\nCollege's belief that \u00a320,000 was an\nadequate sum to cover the loss of the\nbookstore. Professor Swanson pointed out that this deal may even result\nin over compensation if the influx of\nstudents on to the campus post-1998\nDON T WORRN!\nHER-E'S^tou g. CottPENSfcTiGN.\nmeant that there would be greater stationary sales in the shop.\nThe Union's financial model\nassumes that stationary sales increase\nconsiderably and that if they had\nbeen retained, the book selling operations would have not have increased.\nIn contrast, the College Finance\nDivision's model is based on a flat\nrate boosted by a one-off payment.\nSpeaking to Felix, the Rector commented that the Union were \"trying\nto have their cake and eat it.\" He said\nthat the tendering operation had been\nconducted on a professional basis,\nand that the Union could not expect\nto behave like a company and yet be\ncos set ted as part of the College.\nMr Williams said that the Union its case but that now \"the ball's in\nhad tried to persuade the College of their court.\"\n\u00a31 curries set for a rise\nVAS KORBA SAK The price of one pound curries at Da\nVinci's Cafe is to be raised to \u00a31.10\nfrom the start of next term in order to\nkeep up with inflation. It had previously remained fixed at a pound for\nthe last two years.\nThe prices of many other products\nare also likely to be raised by 5p. Ian\nRichards, Imperial College Union's Catering Manager, pointed out that\nmany prices had in fact been reduced\nthe previous year and that a price rise\nwas inevitable. However, to meet demand and to let curry addicts get\ntheir fix all the faster, the curries will\nbe sold from dB's rather than Da\nVinci's next term to help relieve long\nqueues that are currently the norm.\nYvonne Woods, the Assistant\nCatering Manager, thinks that this\nwill not deter students from buying\nthe curries. Da Vinci's currently sells\nbetween about 400 and 700 curries\ndaily.\nWhen asked about their reactions\nto the price change, most students\nsaid they did not mind the increase,\nas the curries were already excellent\nvalue for money. However, some\nreplied that the pound-in-the-pocket\nwas their favoured price, and that the\nextra ten pence was \"just too much of\nan inconvenience.\"\nCLAYPONDS\nASSISTANT WARDEN\nThe College invites applications for the position\nof Assistant Warden at Clayponds which is\navailable from September 1997. Clayponds is\na residential development of houses and flats\nin Ealing. It houses 2nd,3 rd and 4th year\nundergraduates and postgraduates. Assistant\nWardens receive rent free accommodation in\nreturn for pastoral duties within this \"student\nvillage\". The post is open to all non-under-graduate members of the College, but experience of pastoral care would be an advantage.\nFor further information and an application\nform contact Janet Jones, Office Services\nManager, extension 45536, Room 512\nSherfield Building, e mail Janet.Jones@i cac. uk\nClosing date for applications: Friday 20 June\n1997.\n\n"

    "content": "20 SPORT FELIX WEDNESDAY18 TH JUNE FELIX SPORT\nPlain rowing for the (very) good ship IC\nOn May the 3rd, the BUSA championships were at the Nottingham\nwater sports centre. As ever, the\nwater was about as tempting as a cross channel journey to a heavily\nsea-sick person. However, this was\ncomparable to a good day on the tide-way. Imperial College had entered as\nmany boats as possible, in an attempt\nto sweep the board as usual (and to\ntire all the participants as much as\npossible so they would be unable to\npartake in heavy post-event fest iv i ties!). Particular focus was placed\nupon the women's college eight as\nthis is the boat to be raced at Henley\nand this was the venue where all likely Henley opposition would race,\nmaking this a very good sounding-board for that event. The crew won\ntheir final easily against Bristol (who\nare at present head of the universities\nleague, but not for too much longer),\nNewcastle, Edinburgh and\nNottingham. They also came away\nwith a silver for the Senior four,\nwhich lost to Edinburgh, a gold for\nthe Junior four and a gold for the\npair, whose opposition looked like\nthey were in a different race, they\nwere so far behind.\nThe men's development squad\nalso entered a number of crews and\nwon two silvers and a bronze. This is\na somewhat incredible feat, since at\nthe beginning of the day they were\none man short.\nOn the next weekend the regatta at\nGhent took place. Ghent is on the\ncontinent, not in Wales as some\nmembers of the club believed. Two\nminibuses set off on May the 8th with large amounts of kit and equally\nlarge amounts of unsuitable food to\nstave off that journey boredom. Bill\nMason had left the previous day to\n\"sort out the accommodation\". On\narrival early Friday evening, we discovered that in fact the boys had\nplush en suite rooms whilst the girls\nhad been put up last minute in the\nroof on a big line of mattresses - not\nwhat you might expect for serious\nathletes!\nThe Ghent racing course was\nmuch like Nottingham, except that it\nis not as deep. This means that in bad\nconditions, such as that weekend, one\nlane of the course might be completely sheltered and flat whereas the\nothers weren't. This would give an\nextra 15 seconds to the lucky recipient of that lane. Again we had\nentered as many boats as possible.\nThe women raced the college eight\non Saturday which won it's heat easily. In the final they drew Thames\nTradesmen, Tideway Scullers.\nThames A and B and some Dutch\ncrew. The latter had lane 1 and so\ncruised to an easy first. Thames, old\nrivals, had a poor start but hung on\nuntil the last 750 metres, where perhaps their experience paid off and\nwon silver, leaving IC with the\nbronze. However, the Queens Tower\n/ IC composite women's eight won\nthe gold on Sunday. The pair came\nonly 11 seconds behind Wilma (a former world championship gold\nmedallist) and Claire's pair - an\nexcellent result.\nThe men raced their potential\nHenley eight and won Under 23's. Some of this crew were later selected\nto row for Great Britain. The men's club four also won bronze on\nSaturday and Sunday.\nAfter a long and tiring weekend,\nwe sampled some of the delights of\nBelgian ale and sped home.\nUnfortunately, some amongst our\nnumber had somewhat over sampled and whilst demonstrating a gymnastic feat during disembarkation, managed to overturn a step ladder onto an\ninnocent motorist's car. No IC trip is\ncomplete without some hil aaaaaa riou s incident of this sort.\nTwo weeks later at the\nMetropolitan regatta, the women\nwon Senior 1 eights on both days,\nsetting a new course record. The\nQueens Tower women's cox less four\nwon silver on Saturday and gold on\nSunday for Open Coxless fours. The\nnovice men won gold on Sunday\nwith their Senior 3 cox ed four. As\nthey landed their boat after the race, a disgruntled coach nearby voiced his\ndistress with the un floundering success of IC boat club at all levels -\"bollocks that's a Senior 3 four,\"\nquoth he - \"actually that's right,\"\ncame the reply, \"we're novices':\"\nLast weekend Imperial took to the\nwater once again to race at the\nLondon Docklands Regatta. The\nwomen's college eight won College\neights on Saturday, beating Bristol\nUniversity and placing themselves at\nthe top of the Universities league. On\nthe Sunday, the eight won Elite\neights, beating a Queens Tower /\nThames composite crew containing\nthe aforementioned Wilma and\nClaire in the process. The women's novice four did well to hold their\nown in a competitive Senior 3 race,\nalthough they were just beaten into\nfourth place.\nThe results from so far bode well\nfor IC in the future especially at\nWomen's Henley on the 21 st and\n22nd June and Royal Henley on the\nfirst week in July.\n\u2022 *\nfj j ll l^ is IHE..\"\nMill\niii il HH \u00abH^ HnS\nM Bu9*lit: HI Ik iS rf fP5 fj\"*\nu9* SIPS\nWm\nHI\nll f^ ll r^il iF \u00a3*:f1\",11N HH Back: Mary Cole, Becky Dixon, Ruth Keete, Becks Riley, Guy Ingram\n(coach), Mel Hirsch, Alison Trickey, Ruth Willot, Colette Curran.\nFront: Jenny Williams, Tache Tan, Anna MacKonald, Jackie Belbrook,\nSophie Davies, Tim Ramsdale.\nGower power shower for the canoeing flowers\nAlthough rain was forecast for the\nweekend, enough sun was seen by\neveryone on the trip to the Gower to\nensure quite uncomfortable facial\nsunburn for all. The usual late departure meant that we arrived at our\nfavourite campsite at around 2am, after an uneventful journey. An early\nstart (8.30, actually) saw us ready to\nget on the beach and Surf for about\n10am, all keen to attack the waves\nwith a mixture of enthusiasm and\nability (the two didn't always mix, as\na few early swims displayed).\nThe forecast of strong onshore\nwinds was mostly right, but the\nwaves seemed undiminished, and\nmuch fun was had by everyone.\nBreakfast was eaten with a minimum\nof utensils, opening tins with a table\nknife is a perfectionist art, although\nthe flavour of Safeway Economy\nbrands seems unaffected by eating it\nin the great outdoors (as in we'll buy\nbetter next time, really!)\nA trip to the excellent local hostel-lie ry complemented the day well,\nwith everyone performing well at the\nbar, in most cases better than on the\nwater. After an eventful night - our\nForce 10 giving up in a mere Force 6\nwind, and the tent leaking in the 5\nminutes of rain - another early start\nwith surprisingly little backlash from\nthe night before found the waves to\nbe good again, and the sun lotion was\nbrought into play this time, but how\nlong it could stay on was dubious.\nPunctuated by an accident and\ndelays on the M4, and by a food stop\nat one of our member's homes the\nreturn journey was generally a silent,\nsleepy affair, and the small minibus\nwas praised for it's low cost.\nThe club meets every Tuesday at\n7.10 in Beit Quad for an hour and a half session, and we frequently \"Get\nAway From It All\" at weekends. We\nintroduce roughly 10 complete\nbeginners every year, who by the end\nhave attained a good level of performance. So anyone interested in joining next year, turn up on Tuesday\nwith swimming things on, or contact\nus by email on slap per s@ ic.ac.uk.\nReport by Garth\n\n"

Foremost\namongst these breaches is the blatant\ndisregard shown by most customers\nof the JCR for its 'No smoking'\nsigns. The conditions within this supposedly liberated and smoke-free\narea are ghastly and most un whole some.\nElsewhere, another by-law is\nopenly flouted by those playing football in Prince's Gardens.

In the past, many students have relied on chance that there would be vacancies in halls due to no\nshows. Unfortunately, they have been disappointed to find that all the accommodation has been allocated to new 1st year students, who are guaranteed a place in hall. They are then in the desperate situation of being homeless and feel that they have been treated unfairly.\nIt is likely that the next session starting in October1997 will be no different\nand continuing students are strongly advised to find alternative accommodation well before the start of the new academic year. Lists of accommodation in the\nprivate sector will be available from the Student Accommodation Office.

This is Felix's first foray into full\ncolour print for a number of years. It\nis also its biggest issue for a number\nof years. These achievements are not\nfor their own sake but rather an\neffort to give you, the readership, as\nmuch good quality, entertaining\nstuff as possible. This has been my\nphilosophy throughout the year, and\nI felt that the students of Imperial\npaper of Im ge\nising Manage riker College deserved a little bit more\nthan they had been getting.\nDespite criticism of it being a \"tri-u mph of style over content\", I hope\nthat it never can\nhigh-sell-'em-cheap approach. Yes,\nthere were errors and mistakes, but\nthere was also a great deal of quality\nwriting and enjoyable material. I think that everyone who read it\nfound something of interest.\nAs repeated elsewhere in this\nissue I would like to extend my gratitude to all the people who have contributed in whatever way to Felix\nthis year. I would also like to thank\nthe rest of you for being patient and\ngenerally at i1 would like to finish off by making\none last point: the students here really suck, but it's not their fault. Let\nme explain. When I came to university, I hoped to experience some\ngreat experiences and learn some\ngreat stuff, but above all I wanted to\nmeet some fantastic people. I thought that Imperial College would\nbe a congregation of beautiful\nminds; inquiring, open and in s pir ing. Unfortunately it failed to happen and I 'll come away knowing\nonly a few such people.\nThe main cause of this dearth of\nadventurous ness is a teaching system that quickly stifles imagination\nand creativity and promotes syco-phan cy and fatigue.

    "content": "FELIX WEDNESDAY18 TH TUNE ALTERNATIVE REVIEW OF THE YEAR 15\nYear's Eve, when some random girl I'd just met true - a pint is no problem if you're willing to\ntried to masturbate me in Trafalgar Square before\nrunning off to jump in the fountains. The police\nstopped her in time, (jumping, not masturbating.)\nFEBRUARY\nSunday 15, 1:32am. When the phone rings at\nthis time of night, you know it's your friends ringing you up off their heads. I am not disappointed;\ntwo friends whom I shall refer to as X and Y. X: \"Hi. It's me, X.\" Me \"Oh. How are you?\"\nX:\"I' m fine. Absolutely fucking fantastic, in\nfact.\"\nMe: \"You sound very... confident.\"\nX:\"I had a finger of speed before I dialled the\nnumber, and now I don't..x confusion at the other\nend> ...We've just come back from the Q MW Valentines' Ball.\"\nMe: \"Er... yeah? I 've been trying your mobile, but\nit just keeps hanging up on me.\"\nX: \"Maybe that's because I changed net-works.\"\nHe hangs up. Inevitably, it rings again\nafter about thirty seconds. There is further confusion and shouting in the back-ground, presumably as Y grapples the\nhandset from X. Me: \"Hello, Y.\"Y:< jabbering> \"You're not you.\nYou're an imposter.\"\nMe: \"No I'm not. I am me,\nhonest.\"\nY:< interrupting> \"Oh yeah?\nWell what's my name then?\nWhat was your mother's maiden name?\"\nMe: \"But you don't know my\nmother's maiden name....\"\nY tries to convince me to come\nover, straight away. I say it's impossible. He says get a cab. I say no. X has a go;\nMe: \"Why should I come over? You've got no\nbooze...\"\nX: \"But we've got drugs.\"\nMe: \"But they'll all be gone by the time I get\nthere!\"\nX: \"No they won't. If we took them all before you\ngot here, we'd be dead. And there'd still be loads\nleft for you.\"\nMe: \"Oh, I see.\"\nX: \"Am I sounding weird? I'm just asking for\nresearch purposes you understand; I 'll be testing\nyou on this conversation later... The scales of my\neyes filling up. <banging noises> Ow! Get that out\nof my ear!\"\n<Click. Brrrr....>\nMARCH It's Friday night and Mr Blonde and I are at the\nUnion. It's the week of the Sabbatical election\ncampaigns. We've just learned that this year's ICU President had to down a pint of human urine\nas some sort of test to see if he was good enough\nto be elected, and we're wondering how many\npeople you'd need to make a full pint. A friend\nassures us that the average male can piss a pint at\na single pass if he's been drinking, and, in the\nname of science, we feel compelled to investigate.\nEntering the gents' with plastic skiffs empty and\nemerging with them full, we can confirm that it's make a little effort. Unsure of how best to employ\nour discovery, we start depositing pints of secondhand beer, of varying hue and shade, around the\nbar and disco. Placing them carefully amidst other\nabandoned drinks, we are stunned to find them\ndisappearing and, in a number of cases, the levels\nof liquid in each glass dropping considerably.\nWho's drinking them? Serves them right for stealing drinks. With vigilante fer v our, we continue on\nour mission.\nReturning from the cubicles with a warm, fresh\nand particularly pale and milky sample I am no b bled by a friend from hall. I am desperate to get\nshot of my glass but he won't go away, and there\nare no opportunities for me to make my excuses. I can see him wondering why I'm standing here\ntalking to him for so long without taking a sip.\nSalvation arrives in the form of some drunkard\nwho staggers into me, knocking my arm and\nsloshing a good third of the pint over the front of\nmy friend. \"I'm sorry; I 've split my, er, cider all\nover you.\"\nExit stage right, at speed.\nAPRIL\nA flat mate comes back from a festival with two paper squares,\npurportedly soaked in LSD. We\nswallow them and four hours\nlater start laughing\na like madmen. For\nsome insane reason we're watching long-jumping\non TV; the slow-motion replays slow down to a stop, the judge takes an eternity to raise his little\nflag to indicate whether each jump is legal. All the\ntimepieces in the flat are out of sync; a minute\nseems to last forever then you blink and miss a whole hour. I hear 'Tattva' by Kula Shaker for the\nfirst time and nearly go out of my mind trying to\nwork out the lyrics before I realise the pretentious\nbastards are singing in Sanskrit.\nThe next morning the effects linger on. We\ndecide to go to Portobello Road market, a pretty\ndamn stupid idea given our twisted state; the place\nis weird enough as it is. It's hot and sunny, and\neverybody looks as if they're from another planet;\nludicrous clothes, multi coloured hair. It slowly\ndawns on me that some people are wearing their\nsunglasses on top of their heads, over their hair.\nSoon everyone is wearing them on their heads.\nJust what is the fucking point of wearing your sunglasses on the top of your head?\nI am seriously failing to deal with it all; I see an\nold lady pushing one of those two-wheeled tartan\nshopping trolleys and suddenly there are trolleys\neverywhere - we're surrounded. We walk back to\nthe tube station alongside a woman in leather\ntrousers; the squeak she makes as she walks grows\nlouder and louder until it fills my whole world. I want to go home. I want it to end. That afternoon,\nit does.\nMAY Exams and project deadlines wheel around;\nMay is the month of sleeplessness.\nNotes on insomnia: Always remember that a strong cup of coffee contains up to 150mg of caf-fein e;a Pro-Plus tablet is only 50mg, and doesn't distract you from your work enough to constitute\na break. Alternating nicotine and caffeine is your\nbest bet to see you through a night. Amphetamines\nare neither big nor clever; you'll take in about one\nword in every thousand and anything you write\nwill be complete garbage; take enough and sooner\nor later you'll start wondering about ways of\nkilling yourself. You cannot do without sleep, no\nmatter what: allocate yourself a minimum of four\nhours from every twenty-four. Forcing yourself to\nsleep at certain times is difficult, but attainable if\nyou use herbal sleeping tablets. Don't swallow\nthem; crush them up in hot water four or eight at a time; use the weakest tablets you can find for the\nbest natural sleep without the risk of an OD. In an\nabsolute emergency mix a 'flawed emerald'\n(Night-Nurse and vodka) and have a bed within\nstaggering distance - be sensible; liver failure is no\njoke.\nSymptoms of sleep deprivation: shivering, nau-sea, depression. The nausea is often due to the cof-fee; this can be countered to up to a point by drinking water and force-feeding but ultimately you just have to get used to it. With\nlonger-term deprivation things start to\nget pretty weird: random outbursts of\nactivity, hearing things and hall uc in a tion. Yes, hallucination; stay in bright-ly-lit places; if someone suddenly turns\nthe lights off you'll start tripping like a bastard. If you're writing a report,\nalways go back and check what you've\nwritten every 12 hours or so, otherwise\nyou'll start including daydreams and\nstuff you heard on the radio in your\ntext without even knowing it. Drinking tea or coffee for long periods to the exclusion of everything\nelse produces yellow eyeballs, loose teeth and\nsymptoms imitating (so I'm led to believe) dia-be tes. You can tell when high-sugar foods start\nsending you to sleep instead of perking you up and\nfeel like you want to pee all the time but can't go.\nI have, at various times, experienced all of\nthese. Foolhardy? I maintain that the best way to\nstop worrying about your revision is to do the rev i sion.\nJUNE This is the end... A degree is finished and my\nrehabilitation as a useful member of society\nbegins. Sick? Depraved? If you're graduating this\nyear and have spent three or four years at university without doing anything similar, I'd say there\nwas something wrong with you; now you'll never\nget the chance. It's better to regret something you\nhave done than something you haven't;I regret\nvery little. Except that it's over.\nSee you at the graduation ball.\n\n"

Antonio, hast thou heard the news? Hieronious the Seer has said this day that\nthe elements will let loose a furious squall of hail and thunder. This does not bode well\nfor us.\n[Antonio] That is true, for the noise that shall make will no doubt be distracting upon those within\nthe tent!\n[Giovanni] Methinks that this rigid tent was erred upon.\n[Michelangelo] Not so much err as er.. For this idea was rested by an architect cunning enough to build a place of study for the likes of Scorchio.\n[Giovanni] Look now, it it our turn.\n[They reach the clerk]\n[Clerk] Your numbers please gentlemen.\n[Michelangelo] [Aside]] spot some fun here my friends! [To the clerk] My number sir, now let me\nthink. I have it about me somehow.\n[Giovanni] There it is Michelangelo, tucked in your cuff. Thirty-six it reads. There!\n[Michelangelo] Thanks kind Giovanni, It is a number true. Will it do?\n[Clerk] Is that your number sir?\n[Michelangelo] Why 'tis mine. Look I have it, therefore 'tis mine.\n[Clerk] But is it your number sir? I must have your number to enter here!\n[Giovanni] I think that perhaps the worthy refers to your candidature, Michelangelo. Your number\nthere, that I have just lately found, looks to me now some other figure. Thirty-six. What\ncould it be? Ah there on the reverse 'tis writ in bold.\n[Michelangelo] \"Ede and Ravenscroft\"? Why of course, 'tis my robe, a fine a gown as there ever was don't you think?\n[Antonio] Though lacking a fur, methinks.\n[Clerk] So this is not your number?\n[Michelangelo] Yes it is, but not the one you want. I have another.\n[Clerk] \"Ninety-three-o sixteen\", 'tis more like it. There it fits!\n[Michelangelo] Thanks be. Now where was I? Oh yes. Scorchio...\n[Antonio] Speak not that name unto me\nMichelangelo!\n[Giovanni] Enough of the complaints, friends. Where is Bertolucci? He was concerned about this\ntest was he not?\n[Michelangelo] Aye Giovanni. You have spoken prophetically, here he comes.\n[Enter Bertolucci red-faced]\n[Bertolucci] How now friends.\n[Antonio] Bertoiucci. how goes your day?\n[Bertolucci] Not well Antonio. I have for three months my notes studied and yet I know not what the\nsubject means. I fear that I will fail this test.\n[Clerk] Do you have a number?\n[Michelangelo] You must understand, Bertolucci, that the subject of describing how things occur has no\nbasis. You must know that our mentors are, all the time, inventing new ideas without due\nreason, except perhaps to further confuse us. Then, when they test us, they will do so on\nother ideas. So worry not. gentle Bertolucci, for your study so far will not have aided\neven if understand it you did.\n[Clerk] But it will matter not at all if you don't give me your number!\n[Bertolucci] Why does this fool prattle so? I have no numbers left in my brain for anyone else.\n[Giovanni] He doth just bark, ignore him so.\n[Bertolucci] Speak you the truth. Michelangelo?\n[Antonio] Aye he does.\n[Giovanni] Come, we must be seated now. I hope that Lady Luck shines on you all today.\n[All] Thanks Giovanni.\n[All sit and the examination starts.

    "content": "6 NEWS REVIEW FELIX WEDNESDAY 1 8 TUNE\nJEREMY THOMSON It's June and the academic year\n96-97 is petering out like a worm\ndrying in the sun. Let us take you\nback over the peaks and ditches of\nthe year as we present, in our most\npithy prose, the great annual news\nreview...\nIN OCTOBER...\nAs drawbridges were lowered and\nportcullis raised for the new term, the\nEstates Department already had\ntheir first front page story. A large\npart of the library walkway roof had\ncollapsed without warning. About\nfour tons of masonry smashed down\nonto the dozens of students who were\nmercifully not standing below.\nOn a brighter and altogether more\ncurvy note, returning students got\ntheir first look at the enlarged lino-ta stic ents lounge. Renamed dB's, with a sound system to match, the\nroom was a climactic improvement.\nIt also seems to have set a trend, with\nthe new JCR design owing more than\na quick fling to dB's design.\nRollerbladers were told to take a running jump when Security extended their College-wide ban on having\nfun and banned in-lines indoors.\nSkaters could take solace, however,\nin their stout as ICU became one of\njust a few students unions to continue\nselling Guinness.\nIt was a triple whammy for the\nBoat Club, winning the Henley\nRoyal Regatta, the under 23s' World\nChampionships and planning permission to rebuild the boat house just a few weeks apart.\nIt was student politics at its best\ndown at the University of London\nUnion, when Claire Lawrie, the\nFinance & Services Sabbatical, left\nbefore she had even started. Election\nseason had already begun...\n\"Start as you mean to go on\" was\napparently the motto that Guarav\nMisra, C&G President, adopted for\nthe year. Perhaps attempting to\nrevive everyone after the Rector's speech, he invited a pair of strippers\nto the fresher s event. Undergraduates\nwere bewildered as the budget-rate\nmale-female double-act strutted their\nstuff. Ten out of ten for political cor-rect ness, but a big smelly zero for\ntaste.\nHeavy objects continued to fall\nfrom the skies, with Schal's crane\ncontractors, Hewden Stewart, dropping a ton's worth of block and tackle onto the Science Museum site.\nThey followed this first trick by\nsmashing a large bundle of steel\nthrough a Chemistry Department\nwindow, permanently crippling several students who mercifully were\nnot in the room.\nThe cycle of destruction was completed when a copy-cat criminal\ncombined these cock-ups and lobbed\na full beer can from the top floor of\nTizard Hall and through a Mews\nhouse window, rendering unconscious an elderly man who mercifully was not sitting just inside. (Full\nbeer can? Could the perpetrator really have been a student ?)\nThe closure of the substandard but\npopular Montpelier Hall was also\nannounced this month, with the loss\nof seventy-five beds. Simultaneously, homeless students took to\nsleeping rough on the accommodation office steps, hoping to snap up\nrooms as soon as it opened the next\nday.\nBy late October, the dreaded\nBookstore tender had been sent out.\nBids to run the primarily student-aimed shop were to be judged by a panel consisting of a Dean, a ProRector and three administrative\nDirectors. Oh yes, and one student.\nULU's search for Vice President\nClaire Lawrie's replacement was successful first time, with Nick Dearden\ntaking the voters' fancy. Perhaps we\ncould learn something from them?\nSouth Ealing's light-fingered lads\nhad been busy all autumn at\nClayponds, regularly breaking into\nground floor flats via windows that\ncould be opened 'with a coat hanger'.\nDeadlocks were rejected on the\ngrounds of cost, although \u00a3160,000\nwas invested on new carpet.\nSt Mary's Hospital Medical\nSchool Students' Union finally\nsecured plans for a new sabbatical\npost to improve their representation.\nICU Council had agreed in principle,\nbut did not commit any funds, saying\nthat the Medics would have to find\nthe cash (-\u00a38,000) themselves.\nRather to ICU's surprise, they did.\nIN NOVEMBER...\nBack to the bookstore. A motion to\nactively boycott a non-ICU shop was\nquashed by Council as too radical.\nOh, Surprise. Instead, officers hoped\nto receive compensation from\nCollege towards the loss of revenue.\nThis was about \u00a370,000 and rising.\nThe prospect of top-up fees continued to rumble in the background\nlike an inadequately controlled fart.\nThe London School of Economics\nhad tried to charge for the 97-98 ses-sion, but backed down. Similar ruminations had been heard coming from\nHuddersfield, Birmingham and even\nUCL.\nStaff too had been suffering from\ndwindling funds, and the major academic unions voted (just) to stage a one-day strike. Most courses were\ndisrupted, though many staff quite\nreasonably stayed at home rather than\nbrave the dreary rain at the pickets.\nNicholas Scott; wank ered. The World-wide prestige of IC\nsuffered a para ly sing blow when the\nUniversity Challenge team lost in\nthe first round. The Tory-led foursome were defeated by Cambridge's St. Cats on a tie-breaker.\nStudents everywhere could sym pathis e with tory MP for Kensington\nBlinding laser show at the sell-out fresher s' carnival.\n\n"

But I came to realise today that she\nwas not an ly all these things but also vain and foul company. She cannot but look at herself in a looking glass at all times and all she talks is of herself. A more uninteresting\nperson I have never met. my friends. So now, I am even more unhappy.

The Gray's Inn are an\nextremely tidy pub side made up\nmainly of lawyers, and they remain\nunbeaten this year after playing many\nof the Oxbridge constituent colleges.\nCaptain Dawkins got us to\nHarlington after mishaps with the\nminibus keys and traffic snarl-ups on\nthe M4. He then went out immediately to inspect the pitch and amazingly\nwin the toss again for the fourth time\nin a row in a spook i ly Athertonesque\nmanner.\nUsually we play our first XI against\nthese opponents but due to imminent\nexams and projects our select XI was\ndrawn up giving a first cap and\nrounding the cultural education of\nDan who is more at home back in the\nUSA playing baseball.\nIt was decided that we should bowl\non a decidedly sticky wicket - after\novernight rain - and an outfield that\nresembled the Sahara, after being\nsanded just before we arrived.\nMandar and Nigel opened the\nbowling with Nigel picking up an\nearly wicket. But with a near-gale-force wind blowing down the wicket\nMandar found it difficult to bowl\ninto, as did Dave with his spin and\nBarry with his legs pin neither of\nwhom found much movement and\nwhat there was was very slow. A two wicket stand built up 130+ runs,\nbut when this was broken we regularly took wickets. They finished\nwith 215 for 6 off their 40 overs.\nWith Mandar finishing with figures of ten overs 56 for 1, Nigel was\nhis usual economical self with nine\novers 23 for 2, Dave bowled nine\novers 46 for 1, Barry six overs for 33.\nPhil, who bowled the final overs with\nNigel, bowled six overs 42 for 2 off a run-up that started at twelve paces\nand finished at twenty five plus, generating a lot of skidding pace.\nSo came our innings and after a shaky start we were at 36 for 4. Nigel\nand Mandar, who was promoted\nfrom his self-appointed no. 11 spot to\nno. 6, settled the shop and embarrassed the top order by between them\nputting together ninety plus runs.\nMandar was eventually run out on a sharp single for 34, another record\nbroken, he could have done with\nthose glasses earlier in the season.\nBut we were well behind their run-rate at this time and in trying to make\nup the deficit the tail soon were back\nin the pavilion, especially Dave who\nunder orders from Barry, coach for\nthe day, \"to slap it about\" did so and\nhit the first ball hard and high for the\nfielder to make an extremely good\nrunning catch at deep mid-on.\nWe finished with 162, Nigel finishing with 65 runs plus his economical 2 wickets he surely was the man\nof the match once again.\nA good time was had by all and\nthanks must go to the captain's father, who came to watch him play\nand ended up as umpire for the day.\nHe also bought a jug, along with\nthe three from our hospitable and\ngenerous opposition. We enjoyed\nourselves and there was Barry's thought-provoking conversation.\nSports short\nTwo IC fencers, sportsman of the\nyear Edward Rysdale and our very\nown Felixer Mo Mansoori, have\nbeen selected for the British!\nUniversities team to tour Saudi\nArabia for two weeks this summer.\nHope you both do yourselves justice,\nyou lucky swines.\n\u2022 FRESH HAIR SALON \u2022 ' t SH the best student offer in london!

Most\nof the things that are beneficial have happened\nthrough the action of others. They probably would\nhave happened anyway, whether I had been here or\nnot. But, it you look at the major changes that we\nhave had, I suppose the biggest change is the\ndevelopment of the medical school and not only\nthe joining of the new institutions, but the rebuilding of the site and the development of a new academic emphasis for the College during the next mil-lenni um. That is the largest single change that has\nhappened while I have been here.\nDo you feel that you have contributed significantly to that?\nI have done quite a lot of work. In other respects,\nand I'm not sure to what extent it has been successful, it has been to build bridges between the\ndifferent parts of the college, both between the different departments, and between the departments\nand the centre. When I arrived, relations between\nSherfield and the departments were not bad, but\nleft something to be desired. Certainly, departments tended to perhaps be run in a rather traditional mould, each an island unto itself. It is clear\nthat a first class institution cannot function if it\nbelieves that the academic divisions that were relevant 30 years ago are the only ones within which it\ncan operate and plans to operate for the next cent u ry-Clearly these sorts of developments, from both a research and teaching point of view are happening\non the interfaces between the British divisions of\nknowledge, and I think it is fair to say that if a sentient being landed on Earth from outer space today\nand looked at the sum of human knowledge, even\nlooked at the sum of scientific knowledge, he\nwould not come up with chemistry, or physics, or\nbiochemistry or the divisions that we use. That\ndoes not mean that they are not useful divisions,\nbut there is nothing permanent about them and I am entirely happy that we have to have for administration purposes, major divisions of the information that we work on and the figures that we study,\nbut we have to recognise that there is nothing rigid\nabout these and that we have to facilitate work\nbetween them and collaborate.\nYou are a great exponent of interdisciplinary\nresearch centres. Are there any of those that\nhave grown up in the past three years, while you\nhave been at the helm, which you would be particularly proud of as a great leap forwards?\nWell, when you say proud, if that involves my\ntaking credit, none is due at all, but probably the\noutstanding IRC in the country is Process Systems\nEngineering in Chemical Engineering. I mean, that\nis the best in the count!'- \" >\n,\n' which\nhas realised the obj ec i> and the Engineering ai - m nc il shared to work together in tei( is and\nwork with Industry to pro du ioM> mcl li iii\" that\namounted to much more that the sum of the parts\nand could then be self sustaining and \\u achieved that.\nCould you perhaps elaborate on what wi uw: in l to do iain ing half of your i. Well, this embryonic medical school has to\nnuke the transition as rapidly a^ possible lo Iv one\n\\nd it*\ncan be. It will be one of the largest in the UK, will\n\u2022 p\\ cry research-intensive and it has got so rnc very same time,,,wc iwai it to couple that with an under-grade H..o( he best in\nagencies because we have agreements with other\ninstitutions, and all of these things may be able to\nbe made machine-based and I hope that we will be\nable to reduce our administrative costs. Here, we\nwill change the nature of administrative jobs, and I hope it will provide people with a better and more\nefficient service. So, that all is going to be important over the next few years, and the medical\nschool is a pilot of that.\nIt is also true that coming from outside, I was\nvery impressed by the rather run-down nature of\nmuch of the College estate. Many of the labs that\npeople work in here are not state-of-the-art. We\nhave good staff, we have good students, in many\ncases working in third-rate conditions. When we\nmove outside the labs, we come out to buildings\nwhich in many cases need painting or main te nance. You come out into what could be a rather\nmarvellous Iicrc's a car park. The fac ili INTERVIEW WITH A RECTOR the country. Now, we are going to have a really\ngood start with a splendid new bio-medical science\nbuilding, which I think will be both architecturally\nstimulating and good to use. The new course that is\nbeing designed there will be one of the most for-ward-looking in the country, we are using that\ndevelopment as a pilot project for the avocation of\nthe sensible, practical application of IT to teaching\nand communication throughout the College. All\nthe undergraduates will have laptops which will\nplug in all over the place. That is how they will get\na substantial amount of handouts from lectures.\nThat is how they will get timetable information.\nOf course, medics lead a more complicated life\nthan many of us, particularly in the future when\nthey will be doing clinical attachments from a very\nearly stage; these things actually have to be tied\ninto the hospitals and the patients that they are see-ing. There are actually important time-tabling and\ncommunication issues for which this is an ideal\nmedium. So, we are putting a lot of effort into this,\nand I will expect over the next three years to see the\ncampus, which could never become paper less, actually see a reduction in the amount of paper that\ngoes round. For example, we ought to be able to go\nto a substantially machine-based purchasing s ys tem. Now, you can't stop people sending you paper\ninvoices, but a lot of the transactions that involve\nshuffling paper are admissions and we are obviously dependent to some extent upon external\nties foi when people .\nfor recreation are ni\ndeuces are in some \u00ab\ntorn of what is accept\nthe way that we shout\nfirst century.\nIt must be difficult 1\nonce.\nWc can't achieve i ing is that the Colleg\n(it's not as good as it'\nget some of these o th never be able to make\nnot working, the facilities\nvery good. Student res i;,I think, close to the bot-e.I don\"i think that that is\n>\ne moving into the twenty-:ry lo achieve all that at\nI \u2022; \u2022-'\"\u2022\u2022\u2022 'hat I am says very good academically\nil css we\nthings rip; il, we'll\nat last jump. We are going\nto be dependent on the continued application of\noutstanding students both in the UK and abroad\nand people do not want to come and be taught in\nwhat looks like a tip. They don't want to live ih\nconditions that aren't very good and the trouble is\nthat our competitors for those same students are\nnow putting more effort into that and offering\nattractive conditions. So we have got to do something about that. The other reason that we have to\nclean the place up and make it look better and\nmake it a continuing programme after wc finish the\nBMS, is that big money sponsors are not prepared\nto have their names associated with places that\ndon't look reasonable. We're going to improve the\nenvironment as well.\nA more corporate and more beautiful IC?\nAbsolutely.\n\n"

    "content": "14 ALTERNATIVE REVIEW OF THE YEAR FELIX WEDNESDAY18 TH TUNE\nOCTOBER\nThe last night of the Proms. OK this didn't actually happen in October, it was over the sum-mer, but who's counting? The BBC proms are\nraging; myself and a select band of colleagues go\nonto the roof of the Beit Building to listen to the\nmusic coming from the Albert Hall. Obviously\nwe've been drinking fairly heavily. We can't hear\na thing, so we go and watch it on TV in Beit Hall.\nJust before the final number, the BBC proms\nhead-honcho comes up and makes a speech thanking all the musicians, etc... and we notice that on\nhis lectern is a sign reading 'Do Not Sit On This\nWall - Danger Of Falling, Imperial College\nUnion.' Obviously stolen from the rear wall of our\nown beloved building. Collectively, we think\n'Right, we'll have them for that.' And set out on a mission to defend the Union's honour. Across the\nroof of Beit we go, past the various jars containing\nbiological samples (I poured a little Glenfiddich\ninto one; sorry if I ruined anyone's PhD) and the\nvents that smell of gerbils.\nWe soon tire of throwing beer bottles onto the\nAlbert Hall steps and watching them smash, So\none of my associates, whom I shall refer to only as Mr\nGreen, fetches a middle-class pretensions, but had unwittingly\nstumbled into an alien world of depravity.\nEventually we grow bored of our new-found\ntoy and, through some Herculian alcohol-assisted\neffort, leave it atop the bus shelter on Prince\nConsort Road. We return to steal a huge 'BBC\nProms' banner from under the noses of the crews\nloading equipment into lorries; this banner\nremains in our possession. The photographs in the\ncamera have since been developed but cannot be\nreproduced here without identifying both ourselves and its previous owners.\nNOVEMBER\nInvolved with some flighty girl from the\nDramatic Society; We make hurried, graceless\nlove on the table in the Society's room, where they\ngo to rehearse, store things, shag or whatever it is\nthey do. It turns out the table isn'ta table, it's a coffin. Not a proper coffin, mind; it's a prop. Later\nin the year I see the Union hacks carrying a coffin\nacross the\ndifferent hats, and initiate a rapid series of ques-t ions. I have to breathe in the inspector's face and\nwalk in a straight line; thankfully neither of us\nhave ingested anything we shouldn't have and are\nquickly on our way. We drive off, cool as cucumbers. There is not quite enough cannabis in the car\nto be arrested for dealing, probably. A minute later\nwe are a very tense, and lost. Five minutes later I am so nervous I almost write the car off against\nthe side of Westminster Bridge.\nJANUARY New Year's Eve, to be precise. I eschew the\ncrowds of Trafalgar square for a better-than-aver-age party at the flat of a few friends. I get talking\nto this strawberry blonde from Edison, Canada.\nShe flies back tomorrow; perfect. There's a huge\nplastic barrel of punch which contains alcohol in\njust about every form you can imagine, plus fruit,\njelly babies and female underwear. As is always\nthe case, she gets more attractive with every helping from the barrel. About fifteen minutes before\nBig Ben chimes, we stumble together into an\nunfamiliar darkened bedroom and fall over in a wardrobe. Oral sex ensues, which may or not have\nbeen great -1 am in no fit\nstate to\nlarge water pistol. We take turns to\nbring light rain upon the heads of the exiting\nprom-goers before a lady walking her dog spots\nus. It's time to get a little more pro-active, we\nfeel, and quickly take a trip down to the statue\nin front of the Albert Hall. We find it decor at ed, presumably by the prom organisers or similar\nupper-class louts, with road cones, BBC banners\nand a large cylindrical display pillar about the size\nof a phone box. We also find a camera with half\nthe film unused, and begin to take a few snaps.\nAfter some procrastination, Messrs. Green and\nWhite, somewhat over-assisted by Mr Blonde,\ndislodge the pillar and send it crashing onto the\nsteps, smashing an attached perspex box to pow-der. They then attempt to roll it down into the\nstreet.\nDistancing myself from their activities, I realise\nthat I am sobering up. A quick rummage through\nthe nearby bins, where affluent prom-goers have\nbeen queuing all day, yields half a bottle of red\nand a half of white. A group of tipsy, penguin-suited twits have been watching us and hesitantly\ndecide to join in with the rolling; obviously thinking we are of similar ilk. They are very wrong. I offer them the red and they pass it round, each one\ntaking small gulps. One of them compliments me\non the wine; it's probably quite expensive. \"It's not mine.\" I reply nonchalantly, gesturing; \"I just\nfound it in that bin over there.\" Their horrified\nexpressions fill me with indescribable joy; they\nmust have thought they were safe in the company\nof like-minded twenty-somethings with similar\nnine sordid tales\nof ^\nQueen's Lawn, protesting against\nWaterstone's. It looks like the same one - how\nmany can they have?\nI have to go away and laugh really rather hard.\nDECEMBER\nMy mother's car, a Vauxhall Astra 1.3L estate,\nwill do 117mph downhill on the Mil. Above this\nspeed the steering starts to shake uncontrollably.\nIt's3am, myself and a friend are bored of our parents and the whole Christmas thing. We drive to\nSouth Kensington with no clear idea of how to get\nthere; I just don't know central London by car.\nPassing through the city, the road ahead is narrowed artificially by red and white plastic blocks\nand a WPC stand by the side of the road. She\nwaves at us, we wave back. I know it sounds stupid now, but I honestly didn't realise that constitutes a roadblock.\nAfter a short and unexciting chase, in which we\nare unwittingly the pursued, we are flagged down\nby no less than three patrol cars. One stops in front\nof us, one behind and one to the side; these guys\ndon't mess around. Officers emerge, all in their\ndecide. She loses an ear-ring, her mother's, at\nsome point in the act,\nso we grope around in\nthe dark for it before\n\\_ fr n/ cr*fc\u00bb_. \u2022 turning on the\nmiSSpent. light There is\nanother couple\nin the room, cowering under the bed covers. they've been there the whole time.\nWe hastily abandon our search and retreat to the\nliving room in time for everyone to dance around\nlike a bunch of loonies at the stroke of midnight.\nLater, blondie and I retire to a different bedroom\nwhich we have to share with three other couples.\nAs soon as the lights are turned off, a hideous\ncacophony of squelching and muted grunting\nbegins. I'm sharing a sleeping bag with the\nCanadian girl; when in Rome... She starts to make\nan embarrassing amount of noise, probably for my\nbenefit I 'll admit, but I have to clamp my hand\nover her mouth before, as it were, finishing her\noff. Confronted with a room of eight people all\nobviously with the same interests at heart, I'm tempted to throw off the covers, turn on the lights\nand shout \"Half time! Change partners!\" - thankfully by this stage I am feeling a little ill.\nI can't face talking to her in the morning; luckily before she wakes up a friend drags me, hun-g over, to a greasy-spoon cafe.

Even if a satisfactory candidate can be found, the new\nPresident will miss the crucial\nhand-over period of training\nwhich normally takes place over\nthe summer months.\nRegarding whether or not the\nPresident's job could be done in\npart by the other sabbaticals,\nDeputy President elect Rob Clark\nstated \"There are aspects of the\njob that [the Deputy Presidents]\ncan cover, but ultimately there's more than enough work for three\npeople.

With respect\nto his cont in ung role as President,\nMr Allsop stated that he felt\n\"...morally obligated to look after\nthe Union.\" but explained that he\nwould have to talk to his PhD\nsupervisor before making any\nfurther announcement.\nGuilds face the music\nEDWARD SHERMAN City and Guilds Union look likely to make a tidy \u00a32,000 profit on\ntheir latest venture - selling exam\npapers to Mechanical Engineering students at exorbitant prices\n(Felix 1090). The revelation\ncomes after the C&G President,\nGuarav Misra made a declaration\nof his accounts to the Union\nFinance Committee.\nMeeting last Tuesday the\nUnion's team of financial sc rut in e ers heard how Mr Misra managed to earn a \u00a32k profit on a \u00a33,500 turnover. Speaking to\nFelix, Piers Williams, Deputy\nPresident (Finance & Services),\ncommented that the matter \"has\nbeen resolved to as satisfactory\nconclusion as possible.\" He went\non to say however that there is\n\"no way anybody will ever be\nable to account for all of the\nmoney.\"\nIt appears that no precise\ndetails of the photocopying transactions was kept and that matters\nwere not helped by the liquidation of ABA Copytech. Sources\nsuggest that in the final days\nbefore closure, the cash strapped\ncompany was carrying out work\nfor cash with \"no questions\nasked\" and that receipts were not\nforthcoming. One instance is\nbelieved to have involved Mr\nMisra approaching ABA with\n\u00a3450 in cash for a particularly\nlarge job.\nCity and Guilds' other financial headache, that of a \u00a3700 cancellation fee resulting from their\nabandoned Easter Dinner, also\nappears to be close to are so lu tion. With the CCU's creditors\ntaking the Engineers to the Small\nClaims Court, ICU Finance\nCommittee have agreed that the\noriginal sum should be paid from\nC&G's central funds. The\nremaining \u00a3100 court costs and\ninterest charges will be met by\nMr Misra and Martin Ayres,\nHonourary Junior Treasurer.\nSome sources have questioned\nMr Ayres' assertion that the\nC&G Senior Treasurer advised\nhim to make a \u00a3200 payment to\nthe entertainment company. This\nis seen as an admission of guilt\non the part of C&G and undermining any attempt to avoid paying the cancellation charge.\n\n"

Many voters who\nopted for Richard put 'New election'\nas their second choice, giving the\nreopening of nominations a70 vote\nlead over Laurie Tweedale.\nA second re-allocation saw Mech\nEng Postgrad Paul Brown's197 votes distributed between 'New\nElection' and Miss Tweedale,\nalthough a majority of Paul's supporters did not express an alternative\npreference. The final totals gave\nLaurie 260 votes and 'New election'\n321; this being greater than the quota\nof 298 vo yes required to win, nominations must be held open for a fourth time.\nAfter the close of polling at\n5.00pm, the count finished at 7.35pm last night. This relatively short time\ntaken to count the votes prompted\nfears of a low turnout. The candidates were ushered into the Union\noffice to hear the result from the\nelections committee, and emerged\nshell-shocked some five minutes\nlater. Taking advantage of a PA system on a temporary stage, ICU President Eric Allsop announced the\nresult to a comparatively large crowd\nof drinkers sat outside in Beit Quad.\nShortly afterwards, a bouy ant Richard Stultiens spoke to Felix:\n\"I'm just going to enjoy my last\nweek at College\" he said, but added\nthat it was \"...disappointing that noone could decide\" over and above\nthe fact that he himself had not been\nelected.\nDefeated candidate Laurie\nTweedale made similar comments\nand expressed her surprise at the\nresult, claiming that this time around\nthere had been 'serious' candidates\nstanding.\nOther IC students, many of whom\nwere in the Quad to watch College\nbands perform in an open-air con-cert, reacted with surprise and, in\nsome cases, anger. One stated that\nthe students \"....deserved everything\nit got now\" for rejecting these apparently promising candidates. Other\nstudents expressed their dismay that\nthe whole election process would\nhave to be repeated yet again.\nA despondent Eric Allsop\nobserved \"None of the candidates\nran a particularly effective campaign,\nleast of all 'New election'\" and went\non to say \"It is a bit harsh on the can-di dates; they were beaten by the previous two results rather than their\nown merits - or lack of them.\"\nICU Deputy President for Finance\nand Services elect, Rob Clark professed to being \"...amazed that 'New\nelection won, given the quality of the\ncandidates that were standing.\" Mr\nClark went on to suggest that \"..per-hap s people were blindly voting for\n'New election' just to see what\nwould happen.\"\nThe outcome of this election\nleaves the Union in a state of potential disarray.

    "content": "FELIX WEDNESDAY18 TH JUNE INTERVIEW WITH A RECTOR 13\nYou mentioned our competitors in the academic market. The recent publication of The Times\ngood universities league tables put us still at\nnumber three and we have been for the past five\nor six years. Is it your ambition to try to perhaps get to number two or maybe even number\none over the next ten years?\nOf course.\nBut isn't our accommodation going to continue\nbringing us down?\nFirst of all let me say that the Times league tables\nare ludicrous. There are ways of comparing our\neducational institutions, but that is not the way. All\nthat says is that if someone is going to publish a league table it's better to be at the top than the bot-tom, so one is not unhappy to be there. When people say how good it is, I say, \"well yes\", but in fact\nit is a ludicrous table and it is put together in a silly\nway.\nCould you demonstrate this?\nIf one looks at the performance on the research\nassessment, that is a more serious comparison.\nThere I think yes, we can do better. Our engineering is, across the board, I would say, better than\nany in the country. If you want to compare us with\nany institution, you could. But our science is not\nscoring as well as it should be at the moment.\nThe research rating is very good, but what\nabout the teaching rating?\nTeaching ratings in the College, as you are\naware, have been uniformly rated as good to out-standing. Again, there is a question as to the validity of that assessment. I personally believe that the\nexternal assessment of teaching has been a good\nthing. Mostly because it has caused departments to\npay attention and to look at themselves and look at\nthe way that they do things across the College as a. whole. That has been good. I don't necessarily\nbelieve that a department in the College that has\nl our out of twenty four is actually\n; > than one that has scored twenty\n/ four. I don't think that that sort\nj is on is possible. By and large I am\nic teaching assessments\nhave;' \u2022 \u2022 n that I am actual-1) satisfied with our teaching and with our treatment ' '.\"...u lar areas leave\nsomething to j be desired.\nYou were an undergraduate at Oxford. How\ndoes the teaching you received there compare to\nthe teaching that a similar undergraduate\nwould receive here?\nIt's very hard to say. I probably don't know. I did my first degree in classics and then switched\nand did my Geology honours in two years. You got\na lot more personal attention, at least in my time.\nOn the other hand, I think that people here,work an\nawful lot harder. But I suspect that^people in\nOxford these days work an awful lot harder too.\nIt's not all that different. Fundamentally, in Oxford\nand Cambridge, the system is still based on the\ntutorial system where alone or in a group op two' you would spend an hour a week with one of the\ni senior members of the department and in pre para Itign for that meeting you will have done a fait\nI amount of work on a particular topic, and in my\nday it used to be twenty hours work, we'd study a topic in great detail and then discuss it in depth. We\ncan't operate that way, we have a tutorial system\nhere (hat operates in different ways in different\ndepartments; Let me say that although 1 enjoyed\nthat system, it wasn't good tor everyone.\nMy first teaching job was at Oxford, and I found\nthat there were students admitted to Oxford that\ndid not like that system. I found that I had very\ngood students who at the end of the first year I helped to transfer to other universities where they\nwould be taught in a different way because they\ndid not like the one-to-one, possibly confrontation-al, relationship you had where you would be inter-ro gated, challenged and so on. They much preferred to sit in a large audience in a lecture theatre\nor to do prescribed practicals labs and things of that\nkind. It is not uniquely good. It is a good system\nbut there are other good systems too, and I'm satisfied that we've got a good system as well.\nWhen you were an undergraduate or in your\nlater teaching jobs, when was the first time that\nyou heard of Imperial College?\nI must of simply heard of it as a student, you\nknow, as one of great London science and engineering colleges.\nSo there is no particular event that triggered\nyour knowledge?\nNo.\nWhat do you think the public's impression of\nthe College is at the moment?\nI think its a question of whether you ask our\nmore immediate neighbours in South Kensington\nor those that are more remote and I suspect that you\nwould get rather different answers. I take you are\nmore concerned with people who are more remote.\nI think we are seen as a leading science and engineering university, and I use that word advisedly.\nDoes it perhaps make you angry if you are\nwatching the news or reading the paper and you\nsee an expert who has been called in and it's always Professor Whatever from Oxford or Dr\nWhomever from Cambridge. Don't you think\n\"No, we've got a better centre for that, you\nshould be talking to us\"?\nSometimes I do, sometimes I don't. It depends\non what the topic is. We have good press exposure,\nand are pretty good for providing names for the\nmedia at short notice than either Oxford or\nCambridge. We have the tremendous advantage of\nbeing in London, and it is an awful lot easier for\nvarious news companies to come here rather than\nOxford or Cambridge. Occasionally, the media get\nthe wrong person, occasionally, they are right to go\nsomewhere else.\nRight, on to the Dearing Committee.\nYes\nSoon to publish,\nYes, seventeenth of July.\nCan you perhaps reveal a few of your conclusions? A scoop for Felix'. \"Felix says....\"\nWell, you must be nearing the final consult a Yesterday I spent from 8.30 until 6 at the penultimate meeting. What can I say? The Dcaring\nCommittee has had an enormous amount to do in\nfar too short a time. It was told by the go vcr n cm cnt that the report was needed now, and if wasn't provided now then important opportunities would be\nlost. We're also constrained, I think very un fortuna tc ly. by the public assertions by both the previous government and the present government that\nthey do not sec their way to putting more resources\ninto higher education. So the bottom line is that\nwhen the report comes out, it will be long, a great\ndeal will have been done, but a great many matters\nthat required thorough and deeper investigation\nhave simply been touched upon and not really\nexplored to the depth that a detailed solution need-ed. But some of the problems are almost insoluble\ngiven the boundary imposed by the politicians. But\ngiven that, we've done what we can and I don't think that it's giving away any secrets at all to say\nthat the circumstances at the setting up of the\nDearing Committee were precipitated by a financial crisis within universities. If the government is\nnot going to contribute significant more money,\nalthough it has indicated as it has done in its election manifesto that more burden should be put on\nstudents, it would not be surprising if the committee did not come out with recommendations which\nfrom a student's point of view would seem to be\nvery unwelcome. It has been a priority for the committee to try to explore what I might describe as\nunwelcome solutions which would have the least\ndeterrent effect on students participating in higher\neducation and least discriminatory effect on those\nfrom poor backgrounds or deprived backgrounds\nof any kind. Now, ultimately a decision on this is\ngoing to be made by government because we shall\nbe putting forward various alternatives, but the\nareas we would be talking about would be a stu-dent-fee contribution and something to do with\nmaintenance. These can be juggled in various\nways, and clearly one is looking at income contingent loans, learning banks and a whole range of\nthings of this kind.\nWhat is your preferred option?\nI don't think that there is a single preferred\noption. It is such a complicated issue, that my preferred option would be to raise taxation, I mean, if\nyou really want a quick answer, because you don't actually have to raise taxation by very much to\nsolve the problem but from a governmental point\nof view, that would be a way of tackling a whole\nrange of problems. I'm not really dodging the\nquestion but simply saying that student finances\nbecome very technical and you could say that, yes,\nthis element would be right here, but its only right\nif it's that, and that, and that, in other parts of the\nsystem. It also comes down to political philosophy.\nI suppose broadly I am the least unhappy with a system in which if higher education is not to be\nfree, there has to be some division or conceptual\nseparation between maintenance and tuition costs.\nMaintenance is something that is required here and\nnow while students are actually learning, and personally I am quite happy to see that supported by a means-tested grant of some kind relating that to the\nfamily circumstances of the individual concerned.\nIf one then takes the cost of tuition that seems to be\nsomething that you be relate to earnings for life\nthen everyone regardless of their background could\nbe treated the same. Now, if you make that income\ncontingent so that those who go into the least well\npaid professions, particularly public service, may\nnot end up paying anything, or at least only a small\namount, whereas those who go in to industry or\ncommerce would pay a more substantial amount.\nThat sort of division between maintenance depending on family circumstances, tuition paid off by\ngraduates in employment. At that level no-one's background is taken into account because hopefully being graduates everyone starts on a level playing field. I'm not saying that that is what the committee will come out with, but those are the kind of\nideas that we have been talking about.\nSir Ronald Oxburgh, thankyou.\nWords and pictures: Alex\n\n"

    "content": "16 LETTERS FELIX WEDNESDAY18 TH TUNE\nLetters to Felix\nelection mark IV\nDear Editor,\nAs I write this letter, students at\nImperial are about to go through their\nthird round of Presidential elections.\nWhat will be the outcome? Who\nknows, but as somebody who doesn't get to vote, I'm hoping for New\nElection (again).\nWhy? Well, having read the manifestoes of the four candidates in the\nlast edition of Felix, I saw nothing\nthere to put the minds of the 1000+\nnew medics set to join IC in August\nthis year at rest. From where we\nstand, the stories of tents for examination halls and hoards of Imperial\nstudents standing at the entrance to\nBeit Quad waiting to stone all new\nmedics to death if they dare breathe\nthe words 'Medics Bar' don't exactly\nfill us with confidence in our new\nhome.\nI'm not fully aware of what has\ngone on in the past between St.\nMary's and Imperial, and frankly, I don't really care. We must treat this\nmerger sensibly, and attempt to create an ICSM Union that will (a) fulfill the needs of its members and (b) exist in harmony with ICU and the\nother CCU's if we just try to score\npolitical points off each other, the\nbad feeling won't go away, and all\nthe potential benefits of the merger\nwill be wasted.\nI 'll make one thing clear; medics\nare different. Our course is different,\nour style of teaching and learning is\ndifferent, our terms and holidays are\ndifferent and for the majority of our\ncourse we travel around West\nLondon hospitals like nomads. New\nmedics arriving in 1998 will be\nembarking on a six-year course, during which they will be put under\nenormous pressure to do well - both\nfor themselves and for the image of\nICSM. We want to create a Union\nwhich will cater for these differences\nand pressures and provide a 'home',\nbut also allow a full integration into\nICU life wherever possible.\nAt Imperial, you're obviously worried that the arrival of these 'pesky\nmedics' will threaten to divert funding away from central resources, and\npenal is e current clubs and societies.\nWell, I 'll set the record straight - we\ndon't want that to happen. We want\nICU and any ICSMU to fight for\nincreased funding, to provide a fully\ncomprehensive range of services,\nmeeting everybody's needs. Having\nyour cake and eating it? Absolutely.\nAs the saying goes, 'if you don't ask,\nyou don't get'. Future ICSM medics\nintend to ask for (and get) all we can\nfrom this merger, and if ICU doesn't follow suit, well perhaps you're\nelecting the wrong people to represent you.\nNone of the four candidates manifestoes printed in the last edition of\nFelix really promised anything different in future. Your next President\nshould be taking hold of the advantages being thrown at their feet, not\nsimply offering hollow phrases of\nunity. Next year provides the opportunity to completely review the way\nICU represents its members, to grab\nitself by the throat and give itself a damned good shake-up. I personally\nbelieve that the best way to do this is\nto elect a President with a clean slate\n- not a member of any 'clique', or\nwith a history in the Union, but\nsomebody who is not afraid to come\nin and bring a whole new perspective\nto both the merger and future of the\nUnion. That is the platform on which\nI stood for election here at Charing\nCross, and if it came to it, it would be\nthe platform on which I would stand\nfor election as ICU President. You\nsee, I believe that a Charing Cross\nmedic could prove to be all things to\nall people - and at least an October\nelection would not alienate 1000\nfuture members of the Union, as your\ncurrent elections are. So I 'll make it\nclear - should New Election have\nwon last week, I 'll be throwing my\nhat in the ring for the next round,\nstanding on a promise to create an\nICU fit for supporting the world-leading engineers, scientists and doctors of the 21st century. And should\nyou fill the post this time, well, you\ncan be sure that I 'll be fighting for\nwhat I 've said above throughout the\nnext 12 months - because if ICU\nstands still now, it may never catch\nup.\nYours sincerely,\nAndrew Heeps, Vice-President\n(elect), Charing Cross and\nWestminster Medical School\nStudents' Union.\nsing for your supper\nDear Felix,\nWant to make money?\nThen come to Imperial. The college is literally GIVING MONEY mm\nCatering, Bars, Shop,\nReception, Stewards,\nEnts, Print Unit\nif interested leave your name and address\nin the Union Office or contact Michelle\non 594 8060 (48060).\nTraining will take place in the first week of October\niCU IMPERIAL COLLEGE UNION\n\n"

    "content": "18 COLUMNS FELIX WEDNESDAY18 THI UNE And now the end is near, and so I face the final curtain. As those with a long memory will recall, this is how\nlast year's final article began, and,\noriginality being my middle name,\nwhy not trot out Of Blue Eyes' classic again? It has been, to paraphrase\nRonnie Barker in Open All Hours, a funny year. Exams in tents, the\nGeneral Election massacre, the\nUnion Election fiasco, young\nupstarts interviewing the Rector. I finally came face-to-face with two of\nmy long-standing sparring partners,\nIan Caldwell and Mike Hansen. If\nyou keep them on their toes, they're\nreally not that bad after all. A few\nveneers of Sherfield secrecy were\nfinally peeled back, and I hope that 1\nhave shown, as the Rector said, what\na first-class administrative operation\nwe have here. Not. My regrets, aside\nfrom getting hammered in the\nElection, are that I never got round to\ndealing with College Catering.\nMaybe next year. Just quickly, John\nFoster, why does almost 40% of\nsales go on staff wages, and how on\nearth can you only make \u00a3100,000\non \u00a34 million, when you don't get\ncharged rent or any utilities? I think\nwe should be told. Given the large,\ncaptive audience and the often exorbitant prices, it should not require the\nacumen of Sir John Harvey-Jones to\ndo better than this. We clearly can't, so why not let professionals do the\njob?\nSimon Baker\nSince we have reached the end of the\nyear, I thought it would be a good\ntime to revisit the BMS and the\nLibrary ex ten sion, for which I must again thank\nPhil Hilton and\nOliver Clarke.\nThe outside of\nthe BMS is nearing completion,\nwith a huge\neffort going on\ninside. It is really\nstarting to take\nshape and having\nseen mock-ups\nof the lab, the\nmedics and biologists can be\nsure that they\nwill be very\npampered in\ntheir new home.\nShame they're\nnot going to let some proper scientists in it (only joking, boys and\ngirls). The Library, amazingly, will\nbe broadly finished by the time you\nread this, with some of the books\nbeing moved in. All in all, it seems\nthat Schal are doing a sterling job.\nWhat's this, you cry, has Baker been\nVoice of Reason\nno bb led by the enemy? Months since\nhe s lagged them off. Has Caldwell\ngot him wrapped round his little fin-ger? Not on your nelly, miss us. Now\nI'm not out to do a hatchet job (hon-est, Ian) on anyone, and will give\npraise where it's due. Not everything in the Schal\ngarden is rosy, it\nwould seem. They\nmay be good at\nconstruction, but\ntheir accountancy\nleaves a little to be\ndesired. Enduring\nthe SCR slop in\norder to eaves-drop, I heard that\nall is not well.\nSchal, apparently,\nare being audited\non one of their\nother projects (the\nRoyal Opera\nHouse, I think), to\ndetermine the\nnature of certain\nalleged 'irregularities.' I am quite\nsure that such behaviour is not taking\nplace on the BMS project, despite IC\nbeing a very soft target.\nOne organisation that is unquestionably pulling a fast one is City and\nGuilds Union. The exam photocopying scam is disgraceful behaviour by\na body that purports to look after student interests. What seems to have\nbeen overlooked in this whole affair\nis that our exams are copyright.\nCommercial photocopying, particularly where such profiteering is\noccurring, is surely illegal. If this\ndidn't appear dod gy enough, it transpires that the cash proceeds were\nkept in a safe, rather than banked in\nthe usual. It does not take the Serious\nFraud Office to detect the mild\naroma of rodents in this sorry saga,\nbut far be it from me to suggest that\nany of the cash could have been misappropriated or used for nefarious\npurposes. For my part, I trust the\nC&G exec as much as the next man.\nSo there we have it. That's your lot,\nladies and gentlemen. As most of\nyou leave for the epic summer break,\nsome of us will remain and keep the\nhome fires burning. Thanks to everyone who has kept with me this year,\nparticularly those who felt moved to\nwrite. Some of you even managed a letters-page battle, of the like we\nhaven't seen for a while; if young Mr\nWeir makes himself known, a pint at\nSouthside and a beginner's course in\njournalism await him. As Vera Lynn\nonce remarked, we'll meet again,\ndon't know where don't know when.\nGoodnight and God bless.\nWestminster Eye - Hamish Common\nFt After John Major's predictable resignation as\nleader of the Conservative Party, made in his first\npublic announcement after the General Election,\nthe party has been up to its usual tricks of tearing\neach other apart over the new leader. Michael\nHeseltine was out of the race literally years ago,\nwhen a heart attack rendered him (at least in his\nwife's view) unfit as leader. The minor recurrence\njust after the election merely emphasised this\npoint. With Heseltine out of the way the main contenders were Kenneth Clarke, William Hague,\nPeter Lilley, John Redwood and Michael Howard.\nEach candidate had hinted in past times that\nmay have wanted to stand as leader. The battle\nhad never really- been about what actual person\nwas standing but what his views on... can you\nguess? Europe were. With Anne Widdecombe\nputting the boot into Howard's campaign with\nreports on Derek Lewis and all the other people he\nfired during his time as Home Secretary, this left\nthe four with any vague chance of victory in the\nfirst round.\nThose results were again fairly predictable: in\ndescending order it went Clarke, Hague,\nRedwood, Lilley and Howard. Lilley and Howard\nbroke a previous agreement that the last two\nwould support the candidate in third place (they\nall knew they would make up the last three) and\nsupported Hague. This was yet again un sur pris ing, as Redwood and Howard have always\ndespised each other, and they all knew Redwood\nwould be known as the dark horse who stood\nagainst the leader. And his support among the\npublic was feeble.\nWith the second round coming up, the battle\nwill be a Clarke - Hague match, with Redwood in\nthe wings (unless he leaves first), and we will be\nback where we started: a battle between the wings\nof the party. Various old grandees have quietly or\npublicly pledged support for a candidate, again on\nleft/right lines. The right wing of the party resemble Labour's left wing in that they still believe that\nthe reasons why no-one likes their policies is\nbecause they have not been implemented in their\nfull extremity - the solution being to move the\nentire party in their direction.\nOne hopes talk of co-operation in a future\nShadow Cabinet between the wings of the party,\ndespite present hard-line talk (Hague has talked of\na fully Euro-sce pti c Shadow Cabinet). If he does-n't compromise as leader, Clarke may carry out\nhis vaguely-hinted promise and defect with his\nfriends to the Liberal Democrats. History may\nrepeat itself in mirror image of the Labour wran-g ling s of the Eighties, when they chose Michael\nFoot over the more popular Denis Healey, to keep\ntheir extreme left happy. Anyway, time will tell.\nEnjoy your summer.\nDon't forget\nyour free copy\nI:1i1| for the Summer\n\n"

They have given the allowance to sell books within the city to another from outside.\nThis is gr ve indeed! Was not Marcus a generous benefactor, providing greatly for the university and those who study here?\nAye, he did. Now, he cannot do so and not only do I have no ducats, but our place of\nstudy has less also. Scorchio was the one whispered silver-tongued into the Duke's ear to\nsway his judgement. For that, I will duel with thee, treacherous villain!\nThou art right. I did speak with the Duke on this matter. But the Duke hath stated that\nother monies will be made available to compensate.\nAye, and the greater we become the chattels of the Ducal Palace.\nMy plan worked well, then. I have no regret for what Iha v done and I shall have none. I shall fight thee but say to thee now: I shall defeat thee.\nMy dear Giovanni, think carefully about what thou are doing.

I have come to declare the betrothal of the Duke's daughter, the fair\nArianne, to the most noble physician Scorchio. The wedding will be on Midsummer's Night a month hence. In celebration of the event, the Duke has declared two days of\nfeasting and amusement at that time\nAh, what justice is this? Scorchio is to wed Arianne. Good Michelangelo will be please\nto hear this this! What merriment we shall make. Didst I not say that they were suited t one another?

The secret was only\nrevealed when live crickets intended\nas dinner escaped into a re-app's shower cubicle.\nEstates were back in the news with\ntheir bizarre 'Garden on\nEnlightenment' plans for Dalby\nCourt. Also proposed were a canal\ndown Imperial College Road, a huge\ncomputer-controlled laser water\nsculpture on the Queens Lawn and an\neight metre long geological map of\nthe UK. And who's paying?\nMillennium Commission. Possibly.\nThe Royal College of Science\nUnion had their fair share of problems this month when both the Senior\nand Junior Treasurer left.

As well as a world-leading theoretician, Salam contributed to many cultural causes,\nnotably the Third World Academy of\nScience. He was a Nobel prize winning physicist who proved that ethics\nand politics are very much a part of\ngood science.\nIN DECEMBER...\nCongratulations were due to the\nUL U Karate team, including two IC\nstudents, who won the national\nchampionship.

The penalties were\nintroduced unbeknown to ICU or the\nHall Committee, and formed a blanket ban on allowing people to enter\nthe hall including, it seems, one's own housemates.\nThe elusive Medics' Dean Prof\nJohn Caldwell (no relation) was\nfinally pinned down by students at St\nMary's. In a two hour face-to-face he\npledged support for continuing the\nhigh sub vent ion(> \u00a380,000) that the\ntwo large medical schools receive,\nrather than dropping to the less\nimpressive \u00a312,000ish they could\nexpect as a CCU.

The\ngate hit him when a large timber and\nconcrete frame fell onto it. The frame\nfell over because it had been hit by\nanother frame which was hanging\nfrom... can you guess? A crane.\nIN JANUARY...\" I can't fucking believe it!\", was\nthe phrase of the month when Prof\nAlan Swanson revealed that the\nBookstore contract had been awarded to Waterstone's, not ICU. College\nforced the Union to stop all book-sales in direct contravention to the\nMemorandum of Understanding.\nWorse still, it is believed that\nWaterstone's did not submit the\ncheapest quote, and the panel failed\nto consider the benefits of keeping\nthe money within the college.
