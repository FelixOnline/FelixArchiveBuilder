After persist ant attacks, we\nfinally scored. A move down the right which\nwas finally hammered in from the edge of the\nbox by Flanagan. Shortly afterward, Royal\nHolloway had their first attack which ended in\na hotly disputed pan al ty; after this goal\nwe pushed forward again. A sparkling run by\nRimmer and a thundering shot left Royal\nHolloway trailing. After more pressure from\nIC, we forced a corner and Hendy turned in a flash and forced the ball home.\nAfter the change and against the wind IC\nfought courageously, but the wind aided\nRoyal Holloway to a second goal, the ball\nballooning over our unlucky keeper into the\nnet.\nFrom the kick-off we forced RHC back and\neventually after several near misses Rimmer\nscored his second.

A good team performance by us,\nRugby Seconds\nIC SECONDS started well thanks to another\nfine warm up session from Mr Hall. However,\nit soon became apparent that St Thomas's were using the game to test out a previously\nuntried referee. Offside laws, and indeed most\nother laws were disregarded, but fortunately\nthe match was still played in good (if illegal)\nspirit.\nSt Thomas's opened the account after\ntwenty minutes. A long kick through was\ntouched down by fullback John Symes,\nalthough the referee deciding otherwise,\nawarded St Thomas's a try. An em mine ntl y charitable fellow.\nThe try was converted and followed by\nanother quick score to make IC 0-10 down at\nhalf-time. The second half was a dour\nstruggle amongst the forwards. Any attempt\nby either side to spin the ball was foiled by\nblatantly offside defences. St Thomas's finally scored a third try ten minutes from the\nend following a maul on IC's try-line.\nA frustrating game, with sound performances put in by the aforementioned fullback\nand the whole of the pack. A big hot bath and\na good meal afterwards soon warmed away\nthe di appointment of what should have been\nan enjoyable game.\nTEAM: Symes, Chan, Pike, Wall, Nkandu,\nHughes-Narborough, Bishop, Davies, Toole,\nHall, Verity, Hodgson, Bell, Ball, Kirby.\nPage 10 FELIX, November 14, 1980\n\n"

    "content": "Dear Steve\nIn last week's FELIX there\nwas an article about a Guilds\nFireworks night last Wednesday.\nThe fireworks night was in fact\na Mines/Guilds event. Although\nwe helped on the night, Mines\ndid most of the organising and\nran the Barbeque. We congratulate them on a\"ston king\" event.\nWe'd also like to thank Chris\nHalls, warden of Beit Hall, for all\nof his help.\nLove and Kisses\nThe Guilds Exec\nDear Steve\nWe are writing in response to\nan article in the Liberal Society\nmagazine, Forward, in which Mr Stephen Goulder describes the\nCity and Guilds Union elections\nas \"anachronistic\", he criticizes\nin particular the stand-down\nprocedure and the non-use of a departmental ballot or the Single\nTransferable vote system.\nLast year the election procedure\nin Guilds was reviewed at length.\nAfter many discussions it was\ndecided to hold the elections by\npaper ballot at a Hustings U GM, and that stand-downs would be\npermissible within the \" top three\".\nSurely Mr Goulder must agree\nthat it is very important for\npeople to know something about\nthe candidates in an election.\nCity and Guilds Union believes\nthat all students who wish to vote\nshould attend the hustings\nU GM. If the voting did not take\nplace at the U GM, the attendance\nwould drop considerably. Part of\nthe attraction of the Guilds elections is the fact that the\nresults are announced at the\nUnion Meeting, this would not\nbe possible if we used the Single\nTransferable Vote system.\nApproximately550 people\nattended last year's Guilds Election U GM, rather higher\nproportionally than the attendance at the ICU Hustings. We\nwould also like to point out that\nR CSU, who run their elections\nby departmental ballot box, had\nless people voting than Guilds\nhad at the Election U GM. Can\nthe Guilds elections really be\nclassed as unrepresentative?\nMr Goulder also attacked the\nstand-down procedure. In the\nGuilds elections a Presidential\ncandidate may stand-down to\nVP or Hon Sec, and a candidate\nfor VP may stand-down to Hon\nSec. There are certain qualities\ncommon to the top three posts,\nand any worthwhile candidate\nwould only stand-down if he\nthought he was capable of doing\nthe job well.\nWhilst always welcoming\ncriticism and discussion, we feel\nthat either Mr Gould er is\nignoring the la ets, or he doesn't know them. Perhaps he should\nresearch his subject a little more\nfully before putting his views into\nprint.\nDave Gayer and Sara McGuiness\nC& GU President and Hon Sec\n.Sir\nLast Wednesday at Hariington\na member of Guilds 2nd XV( Mark Wilkins) was injured\nplaying rugby.\nOn seeing that he was breathing\nirregularly, incapable of speech\nand unable to move, we decided\nnot to move him but to send for\nhelp.\nAs there was no one in the\nsports centre, capable of first aid,\nwe called for an ambulance.\nMark was subsequently found to\nhave concussion and was released\nthat night.\nThe point is this: Mark could\nhave been very seriously injured;\nspinal injury, for example.\nSimilar accidents could occur at\nany time, and not just in a rugby\nmatch. Yet at the time there was\nno first aid trained personnel at\nHariington.\nTwo years ago, a member of\nRCS Rugby suffered a compound\nfracture playing against Holloway, again at Hariington. He\nhad to wait a quarter of an hour\nfor an ambulance.\nLast year a football player\ndamaged his knee \u2014 same result.\nA member of Guilds rugby raised\nthe first-aid problem with Roger\nStotesbury, to no apparent result.\nIsn't it about time something\nwas done?\nJim Storr\nCapt\nFor C&G2 nd XV Dear Steve\nEver since I 've been at IC I 've\nbeen under the impression that\nthe spirit of goodwill was\noverflowing. So, last Thursday\nevening I decided to test it out by\nleaving my wallet on top of the\nSpace Invaders machine (all\nright I admit I play Space\nInvaders). I even tried to make it\nharder by leaving all of \u00a35 and an\nexpired Barlcaycard/Barclaybank card inside, not to mention\nloads of personal addresses,\ntelephone numbers, etc., so\nconvinced was I that I'd get it\nback the next day. Well, 'twas\nnot to be and I must say I'm dismayed. It's now Monday afternoon and not a whisper of a boomeranging wallet! Well, could\nyou blame him/her, who was to\nknow except me!\nSo please, if you've got my\nwallet just get it back to me\n(minus cash if absolutely necessary). If not for me, for the sake of\nmy friends whom I won't be able\nto contact again (sob, sob). This\nis a plea!\nGimme back my wallet . . . please.\nTa very much\nAlan Edwards\nChemistry 2\nDear Sir\nI have been asked by the\nGaelic Football Club to write to\nyourself concerning the letter by\none Tim Latham regarding his\nill-informed notion that there are\nno Gaelic football teams, pitches\nor referees within 300 miles of\nLondon.\nI would like to point out that\nGaelic football is organised in\nLondon, Hertfordshire, Warwickshire, Lancashire, and Yorkshire. In London there are\nthree football leagues, each with\nabout twenty teams, apart from\nthe hurling, camogie and handball leagues, which are also\nplayed.\nLondon as a 'county' enters\nteams in the All Ireland Championships every year and\nthe game in London has flourished\nto such an extent that a large\nnumber of those now playing\nregularly are English-born.\nHowever much people such as\nthe said Latham say that the\norganising of a Gaelic football\nteam is a joke, it is my feeling and\nthat of several others that it is less\nobscure than many of the sports\nplayed around College and that a College of our size could easily\nsupport a decent Gaelic team.\nWe are the first College in\nLondon who have tried to set one\nup.\nI am at present in contact with\nthe Gaelic Athletic Association to\ntry to get affiliation and I hope to\nhave arranged a few friendly\nmatches either just before or just\nafter Christmas. If anyone is\ninterested and has not contacted\nme could they please do so via\nthe Union Office.\nJ Passmore\nDear Mr Marshall,\nIn the spring term of last year,\nwe (the undersigned) were living\nin room 19, Garden Hall when a rather amusing incident occured.\nDuring the sabbatical election\ncampaign we received a personal\nvisit from Mr Passmore. He gave\na copy of his election manifesto to\neach of us. Our Greek roommate\nlooked at his momentarily and\nthen screwed it up and threw it in\nthe bin. (We have been assured\nthat no insult was intended and\nhe only did it as a joke.)\nMr Passmore was not amused!\nHe told us all quite firmly that\neach sheet cost him V2p to print,\nand that he had spent ^20 of his\nOWN money on printing them.\nQuite heatedly, he then told us\nthat it was bad to waste other\npeople's time and money. We\nhave done some calculations to\nput the whole matter into\nperspective. Mr Passmore could\nhave printed 100,000 election\nsheets with THE \u00a3500.\nMoral of this story . . . . All\nanimals are equal, but some are\nmore equal than others \u2014 It's alright for some.\nfours faithfully\nI AO 'Neil, Chem 2\nA J Roberts, Chem 2\nDear Editor\nFrom last week's FELIX it\nappears that one Mr Steve,\nMarshall \u2014 the sheriff of the\npress, has taken to roaming the\nstreets of Imperial College with\nhis gun slung low, beating\nunfortunate people like the Gang\nof three and 'Denis the menace'\non the draw. However, there are\nsome big gun slingers around \u2014\nthe type who leave no man\nstanding, those who can pump\nlead into you so fast even your\nancestors will feel it, so watch out\nyoung Marshall.\nRegretfully, we are not in the\nUSA, where people can be sued\nout of existence or else your\nlawyers and insurance company\nwould have a warrant for your\narrest. If you are a man who is\nworth anything, defend your\nclaims that Dare Afolabi, the\nPresident of the Afro-Caribbean\nSociety, is a compulsive liar,\nbecause we want to know all the\nfacts. I am delighted that you\nrealise that WE have the power\nto remove you from office,\nalternatively, you could resign in\nshame. As I 've told you there are\nsome real quick mean gun\nslingers around \u2014 you are\nwarned \u2014 Marshall law does not\nprevail in IC.\nG Quartey\nChem Eng PG Dear FELIX\nMay I say how much I personally enjoyed BB Wolffe's hilarious item reporting my\nefforts to relieve overcrowding in\nWeeks Hall in terms which were\nbroadly correct.

    "content": "especially Steve Rimmer.\nTEAM: Williams, Dunhill, Griffiths, Redmayne, Drabble, Simms (capt), Hendy,\nEsberger, Rimmer, Flanagan, Wiggins.\nFootball Fifths\nON Wednesday at Harlington the fifths\nmaintained their 100% record with a fine\nfighting display against a very lively Mines\nteam. Twice in the match Mines fought back\nto only one goal behind only to be thwarted\nby further goals from the fifths as they\nshowed their real character.\nFrom the start the fifths were kicking with\nan almost gale force wind behind them,\nputting Mines under continuous pressure.\nThe first goal came when Kelly fed Healy on\nthe edge of the six-yard box, who made no\nmistake. Dave Hardy outpaced the Mines\ndefence and crossed to the far post for John\nHealy to nod home the second goal. When\nMines pulled a second goal back, IC went\nback on the rampage and Archer restored the\ntwo goal lead with a low, well placed shot\nfollowing a Baldwin corner.\nIn the second half Mines started to look\nmore dangerous and fifths ace defender Al\nCable came into his own, making a stream of\nhard, resolute, but fair tackles at the centre of\nthe defence. When Mines did score due to a Brown-Gohil combination, the fifths showed\ntheir character by launching some spectacular attacks on the Mines goal which resulted in\nHealy slotting home. Minutes later Archer\nwas chopped in the penalty area following a good run and Teaham made no mistake from\nthe spot.\nAt the end of the game all credit had to be\ngiven to Mines seconds who are the first team\nthis season to extend the fifths.\nTEAM: Brown, Audin, Gohil, Teaham,\nCable, Morris, Archer, Kelly, Hardy, Healy,\nBaldwin.\nCross-country\nON WEDNESDAY the second London Colleges' League was held at Uxbridge over a flat, fast, five mile course.\nThe first runner home for IC was Kelly\n(14th) followed by Longhurst (25th), Smith\n(26th), Kirk (29th) and Bartolomasi (48th) to\nmake up the first team score. The team was\nplaced 3rd behind WLIHE and LSE.\nThe second team were placed 2nd equal in\ndivision 2. This team being made up by\nHoldsworth, Parker, Hayward, Tuckwell,\nFrost, Westas.\nThe overall league positions are now: the\nfirst team are second in Division One being\none point behind WLIHE and the second\nteam are fourth in Division Two.\nThe next league race will be on Wednesday,\nNovember 26, at Richmond Park, where a full\nturnout is essential.\nRiding\nLAST WEDNESDAY, the Imperial College\nRiding team took part in the first UL U competition of the season, against the Royal\nVeterinary College and Kings College. The\ncompetition was held at Park Farm, Northwood, and involved a dressage test and a show jumping course.\nThe results were: IC 243; RVC 230, Kings\n192.\nIn the individual placings Singer and Still\ntook first and second place respectively. This\nis the first time Imperial has won a competition\nand hopefully this standard will be retained\nthroughout the season.\nTEAM: Singer, Still and Walden.\nResults and reports\nSaturday, Nov 8\nRugby\nIC 1st XV\nIC 2nd XV\nHockey\nIC 1st XI\nIC 2nd XI\nIC 3rd XI\nBasketball\nRSM\nRoyal Free Hosp\nRoyal Free Hosp\nSonning\nSonning\nSonning\nGuilds\n26-0\n28-0\n1-2\n3-2\n1-3\n62-52\nHockey Seconds\nON an otherwise unsuccessful day for IC\nHockey, the 2nds extended their winning run\nto four matches, in a game which produced\nthe most satisfactory result of the season so\nfar.\nComplacent after last week's130 victory,\nIC allowed Sonning to control the first half\nand at the break IC were 2-0 down.\nThe second half was however, entirely\ndifferent, and aggressive play soon led to a goal that brought us back into the game. A long run down the right wing by Andy Garms\nled to a telling cross which was neatly swept\ninto the goal by Ahmeet Rao. Soon after, a shot was stopped on the line by a foot, and\nthe ensuing penalty was competently\nconverted by Mike Chew, thus maintaining\nhis record of scoring in every game.\nThe decider came when the ball found Phil\nWebb free in the area and it was a simple job\nfor him to chip it past the goalkeeper. IC were\nunlucky not to go further into the lead when a fourth goal was disallowed, but Sonning\ncouldn't get back into the game.\nTEAM: Jones, Parker, Bird, Rogers, Masom\n(Capt), Chew, Rao, Stroomer, Garms, Gray,\nWebb, Shaw.\nHockey Thirds\nOUR undefeated away record remained\nintact after our fifth successive fixture at\nHarlington. The loss of two captains (Tim and\nPhil) in three days led to this week's superior\norganisation off the field. However, the\nimportance of these two superstars (nay\ndemigods) on the field was sorely realised.\nIC conceded two early goals before coming\nto life. Steadily creating chances through the\nfirst half, we finally scored immediately after\nthe restart, through Dave Cornwell. An evenly\nfought second half ended with the match\nbeing settled by the ball being hammered\nover IC's goal line.\nImpressive debuts by Caroline Brown and\nJohnson Afilaka were so much appreciated\nthat they may be recalled.\nFortunately honour was restored after the\ngame, with a53 victory at table-football.\nWe're at home again tomorrow lads, in case\nyou hadn't guessed.\nTEAM: Hutchings, Pound, Leinster, Purdy,\nClift (Capt), C Brown, Cornwell, Afilaka,\nWylie, Taylor, Benham. Umpire: Rob\nMorgan.\nSo where's all these\nphotos then?\nCross-country\nON SATURDAY a squad of four set out for\nGuildford for the Stag Hill Road Relay. The\nrace comprised of 6 x1.7 mile circuits of the\nSurrey University site. Gary Longhurst set the\nfastest IC time on the first leg and also ran the\nfifth leg only 30 sees slower. The team came\n15th out of 40. Barrett, Hayward and Thwaites\nall produced good sub-10 min times. The next\nevent is November'26: the 3rd London\nColleges' league race.\nSnooker\nI REGRET to announce that it is unlikely\nthat the Snooker club will be getting a third snooker table this year. Our claim\nwas referred to Council at last week's UFC\nmeeting which has ruined our chances for\nthis year.\nThe 'B' team managed to take one frame\nfrom the ' C team last Wednesday in an\nunexpected 4-1 defeat. The A team lost one\nframe against LSE B team. C Tripp was\nblamed for this when he lost for the first time.\nSailing\nON SATURDAY, IC Sailing team travelled to\nReading for their first league match of the\nseason. The sailing took place on the River\nThames, which is only about 40 yards wide at\nthis point, and the fluctuating winds and river\ncurrent made conditions very difficult.\nIn the first race positions were changing\nconstantly, but at the finish Reading took 1st,4 th, and 5th to win. However, Dave Chadwick\nwas involved in a collision, and with Reading\nfailing to take penalty points, a protest was\nlodged.\nIn race 2, IC led, but the wind dropped, and\nthey eventually finished 2nd,3 rd, and 6th giving Reading the race,\nthe complex protest situation, and this time\nIC lead from the start, and won easily with 1st,2 nd and 4th positions.\nThe third, deciding race, was very close\nwith IC 1st,3 rd and 5th after the first leg, but\nagain were caught out by the current, and\nReading won the race.\nThis gave Reading the match by 2 to 1,\nalthough the IC team sailed very well, and\nwere unlucky not to win.\nTEAM: Murray, Butler, Kennedy, Younghusband, Chadwick, Redman.\nRugby Allstars\nIC Ladies XV v IC Select XV Sunday 16 November\nat Harlington\nAnybody welcome \u2014 support needed.\nTenpin Bowling\nNext Event:\nUC TBA vs Brunei University\nAt: Charrington Bowl, Tolworth\nOn: Sunday 16 November 1980\nStart: 12:00 noon, prompt\nAny and all supporters welcome.\nFEUX, November 14, 1980 Page U "

    "content": "Science\nFiction Soc\nIMPERIAL COLLEGE Science Fiction Society\nare proud to present one of the neglected\nmasterpieces of fantastic cinema. Killed by the\ndistributors on first release, Quintet is one of the\nfive best science-fiction films ever made (decided\nby the society committee by a three to two\nmajority).\nSet some years after the onset of the next ice-age, it stars Paul Newman as a hunter, who\nreturns to the city (a refuge built when the ice\nstarted to move) when his wife becomes\npregnant. An object of curiosity in the city, where\nthe birth-rate has dropped to practically zero, she\nis killed in a bomb-blast which also kills Newman's brother and his family. His subsequent hunt for\nthe murderer embroils him in a sinister game of\ndeath, refereed by the manager of the city gaming\nhouse (a remarkable performance from Fernando\nRey).\nThe realistic style of the director, Robert\nAltman (whose previous credits include MASH,\nNashville, McCabe and Mrs Miller and California\nSplit gives this film a conviction that most films set\nin the future lack. The recurring images of\ndesolation and the veiled suggestion that the film\ndepicts the last days of the human race, make this\na film you will remember.\nOn a lighter note, it was made in 1978, and is\ntherefore in colour with plenty of violence, so if\nyou liked Rollerball, which was basically violence\nwith a redeeming 'message' as an excuse, you'll\nenjoy Quintet as well.\nThis is a much longer ad than usual because it's not a famous film, but I'm sure that after seeing it,\nyou'll wonder why it isn't. Quintet, Mech Eng 20, November 18, 6:30pm50 p for non-members. 20p for members.\nICYHA\nLAST WEEKEND we stayed at Youlgreve youth\nhostel in the Peak District, a trip enjoyed by all\nthose who came. The highlight of the weekend\nwas probably the walk on Sunday, which included\nKinder Scout and Kinder Downfall, and of course,\nthe peat bog, whose victims were eagerly\nphotographed!\nThe list is now up for the weekend to Brecon\nBeacons in one week's time (November 21-23)\nand our last trip this term will be to Snowdon in\nNorth Wales (December 5-7). New members are\nwelcome; we meet regularly every Thursday in\nSouthside Upper Lounge at 12:30p m.C&G Motor Club\nTHIS WEEKEND there is the annual Prod\nuc tion Car Trial; it is composed of a number ot\nauto tests and 'hills'.\nThe auto tests consist of driving set courses\naround bol lards laid out on flat ground, and ate\nagainst the clock - although speeds are unlikely\nto exceed 15mph, due to the tight man oe uv ring required.\nThe other tests involve driving slalom routes\nup slippery hills, scoring is by the distance up\nthe hill, which is measured before the un driven wheels stop turning, or before a marker cone is\ntouched.\nThe event will be held on Sunday November\n16, and starts at 9:30am, about 40 miles from\nLondon (in Kent), and all that is needed is a car\n(yours or a friend's) and a club membership\ncard - you can join on the day at a cost of 75p. Further details, and entry forms, from the City\nand Guilds Union office in Mech Eng.\nDifferent categories separate the more\ncomp etat ive e.g. rear-engine rear wheel drive,\nfrom the less competitive e.g. front-engine front\nwheel drive cars, and are further divided\nbetween novices and experts. Entry costs \u00a33.00,\nand if you cannot find a car or cannot afford\nthis, then why not come along and watch?\nMark Turner\nCaptain\nIndia\nSociety\nON SATURDAY, November 1, India Soc\norganised a function for the Indian festival of\n\"Diwali\", or Festival of Light. Diwali celebrates the\ntriumph of (Jood over Evil and the start of the\nIndian Year. Traditionally it is celebrated by\nexchanging gifts, renewing old friendships\n(season of goodwill and joy; where did I hear this\nbefore?), lighting candles /lamps around the\nhouse (hence the name Festival of Light) and with\nfireworks.\nHowever, having failed to obtain permission to\nset fire to the JCR, we had to be content with the\naudio-visual entertainment provided by a live\nband 'Kala Preet' and a Bhangra (Punjabi folk\ndance) group, 'The Great Indian Dancers'. Indian\nfood was on sale during the evening: 'samos as' and 'pak om as' from Southall (where else?) and\nreal, mouth-searing, home-made 'char as'( prepared by a sadist or somebody with a death\nwish). The live entertainment was followed by a disco till 2:00am. The event was attended by 300 people:\nstudents (Indian and European) from all over\nLondon and a few from the Midlands. The result\nwas a very successful and enjoyable evening\n(trouble free more due to the size of the\nPresident's fists than any lack of the rowdier\nelements). Everything was organised perfectly\nand the evening went without any hitch. For the\nfirst time in umpteen years an India Soc function\nmade a profit: all of \u00a36!\nI would like to take this opportunity to thank\neveryone who helped organise it, worked on the\nevening and all those who attended and helped\nmake it so successful.\nThe next India Soc fun c it on is a Republic Day\ncelebration on Saturday, January 24, 1981.\nASG\nHam Radio\nSociety\nLAST TIME 1 penned a Hamsoc article for FELIX\nI said we would help you pass the RAE. However I neglected to say what RAE stood for and may\nhave misled you into thinking that we intended to\nvisit Farnborough. Let me put the record straight.\nRAE, in this instance, stands for Radio Amateur's Exam which is what you need to pass to obtain an\namateur licence. The exam is set by the City and\nGuilds of London Institute and is held twice-yearly. Once you have passed you become\neligible to apply to the Home Office for a Class B licence. This entitles you to transmit in the\namateur bands above 144MHz. If you have also\npassed the Post Office Morse Test you will have a Class A licence and may operate below 144MHz. It is important to note that you do not need to\nunderstand morse to be a radio amateur. Also a class B licence holder may operate a hf station\nunder the supervision of a class A operator.\nThe purpose of sitting the RAE is to show that\nthe operator has sufficient technical knowledge to\nkeep his transmissions totally within the\npermitted frequency bands and to the correct\npower levels, i.e. if he does cause interference he\nshould know how to stop it. But what is the exam\nlike? There are two papers; the first on licensing\nconditions and transmitter interference and the\nsecond on operating practices, procedures and\ntheory. The questions are all multiple choice and\nvary from the \"Ohm's Law is . . . \" type to less\nstraightforward sorts on techniques specialised to\nradio.\nThe next RAE is in May. Hamsoc will be\nrunning a series of preparatory lectures, as we did\nlast year, starting at the beginning of next term.\nHowever if you want to be sure of sitting the\nexam in May,, and without having to travel to\nsome remote corner of Britain, it is necessary to\nsend for an application form now. We will do this\nfor you (even if you are not yet a member of\nHamsoc), just send your name and department to\nDavid Legg, Physics PG. If you would like to\nknow more about the RAE or amateur radio in\ngeneral come along to the temporary shack (top\nfloor of the Union) any Wednesday afternoon.\nWIST\nWomen Under Apartheid\nWOMEN IN SCIENCE and Technology are\ndisplaying a photographic exhibition on\n\"Women Under Apartheid\" in the JCR on\nTuesday November 18 during lunchtime. It will\nthen be displayed in the ICWA lounge for the\nfollowing week, (which is on the 3rd Floor\nUnion Building, and is open to anyone at all\ntimes) and there will be a discussion on this\ntopic at the WIST meeting on Wednesday\nNovember 26 at 12:30pm in the ICWA lounge.\n.Anyone is welcome to come along.\nI should also like to mention here that we are\ngoing to see \"Slow Motion\" on November 19 at\nCamden Plaza and anyone is welcome to come\nalong. Meet at 5:45pm in the Union Lower\nLounge.\nJill Hanson\nWIST\nAmnesty\nInternational\nAMNESTY INTERNATIONAL (A. I.) is a nonpolitical world-wide organisation which\ncampaigns for the release of those people who\nare imprisoned for thier beliefs, race, or colour,\nand who have never advocated or used\nviolence. The A.l. group at IC is an adopted\ngroup, and as such, has a prisoner of conscience assigned to it, and it is the group's responsibility to campaign for the release of the\nprisoner by writing to the prison authorities\nconcerned, and any other persons who it is\nthought may be of assistance.\nAs part of a fund-raising scheme, the group is\norganising a24 hour sponsored fast, to take\nplace from 9:00am Friday December 5 until\n9:00am Saturday December 6. The fast will be\nheld in the JCR until 6:00pm on the Friday, and\nin the ICWA lounge afterwards. If anyone is\ninterested in taking part, or would like to\nsponsor a participant, will they please contact\nBob Sloss, Botany PG, or come along to the\ngroup's meetings, every Tuesday, 5:30pm in the\nGreen Committee Room, top floor of the Union\nBuilding.

    "content": "Southside Security Survey\nJust to be tiresome, I conducted another\nTWO security surveys of Southside this week,\non both occasions, the Falmouth/Tizard doors\nwere unlocked. Here, students can help by\nmaking sure they close the doors properly\nafter them. Mind you, if an efficient door-closer\n(like Week's Hall, for instance) were installed,\nthe human element could be eliminated.\nApparently, while I was out of the office this\nweek, the chap from Estates who is charge of\nthe fire doors popped in. He was annoyed, he\nobviously feels FELIX is interfering with his\njob. I personally don't feel we could have\nannoyed him enough as absolutely nothing\nhas been done since last week. You can still\ngain entry by opening the bolt from the\noutside.\nOnce you have gained access to the gallery\n(outside) level there are all the staircase doors\nand the main fire escape stairwell doors by\nw!,. ch to gain access to the halls. If any one of\nthese doors is unlocked, an intruder can gain\naccess to ALL of the four halls.\nEarly Monday morning, I attempted to get\ninto Falmouth (home) without a key. The bolt\npresented little problem as I was then on the\noutside gallery. I was then surprised\nto find all the Falmouth doors, and fire escape\ndoors actually locked. Just one door, to\nKeogh, was open. One might initially think it\nimpossible to get into Falmouth from Keogh\ndue to locked interconnecting doors. No\nproblem! Complete absence of any locks on\nthe penthouse level (where the Wardens live)\nallow access to both sides ol Southside. Simply\nwhizz up the lift on one side and zoom down\non the other. There's always access via the\nbasement as well, but a potential intruder\nwould risk meeting night security.\nI have no wish to pull College security to\npieces as that itself would constitute a security\nrisk, but I do feel that the problem with\nSouthside could be so easily remedied. I shall\ncontinue to utilise Editorial space in this\nmanner until something is done. If I can still q et into Southside without a key by next\nWednesday, I shall start naming names \u2014\nwatch this space!\nExec Torture\nNot being a member of the Exec, I was\nsomewhat surprised when I was manhandled\ninto the Quad from the office to have bulls'\nblood and putrid ducks' bodies poured over\nme. I wasn't too pleased that I was wearing\nmy usual clothes at the time. More people\nPuzzle Corner\nBy Scaramouche\nAt Primelia, the pure mathematicians speak\nnothing but honest, rigorous truth. The\napplied mathematicians, on the other hand,\ninvariably tell lies (which they call 'approximations') whereas the statisticians (who never\nlike to be definite about anything) alternate\ntrue and false, or false and true.\nRecently, a certain amount of gossip has\nbeen going around concerning the activities of\nthree maths lecher ers, each of whom is having\nan affair with a different one of the young ladies\nmentioned below. When questioned about his\nun chastity, each made three statements.\nRumble said: '1 started my affair the week\nbefore Flirt started hers. None of the girls has\nblue eyes. Fluff's affair hasn't lasted as long as\nQuirk's. Prong said 'Rumble is not an applied\nmathematician. If Fluff is his lover, then Fling is\nmine. His three remarks include the same\nnumber of false statements as my three'.\nQuirk said 'My affair started before Fluff's. Prong's started before Rumble's. Rumble is\nnot a statistician.'\nSo how are the pairing s arranged?\nSolutions, comments and criticisms to me\nc/o FELIX Office. There is a prize of \u00a34 for the\nfirst correct solution opened at noon on\nTuesday.\nLast Week's Solution\nAll except Bumble.\nWriting e.g. 'AB' to mean 'A gave it to B'. here is the outline of the solution.\n1. If FB then B received it more often than\nhe lent it. So B has it.\n2. If not FB, then BF. So F received it three\ntimes but can only have lent it out twice\n(including once to E). So F has it, and FE. But\nin this case, since D gave it or received it an\nodd number of times (5) it started with D. So B gave it or received it an even number of times.\nSo EB, so not FE, contradiction.\nApologies to any who felt the wording was\nslightly ambiguous. If anyone wants a fuller\nsolution, write to me.\nAnd talking of correspondence, why is it\nthat the only feedback I get is to tell me the\npuzzles are too easy? All the information I get\nabout the trouble people have comes to me as\nvague rumblings heard distantly along the\ngrapevine. I need to know how many teeth\nwere gnashed, how many man-hours wasted\nover a tough puzzle like last week's before I can set problems of the appropriate standard\nof difficulty.\nIn any event, no one submitted anything last\nweek, so this week's puzzle is rather easier,\nand the prize is doubled.\nseem to have paid to have me shat upon\nthan any of the Exec. Should I take it\npersonally? Still, it swelled the Rag funds and\nit was worth it to see just how quickly the\ncrowd dispersed when I emerged with a tightly clasped handful of shit.

I can only assume that the\nconsiderable degree of literary\nlicence used in this regard was\nintended to be ironical.\nHowever, if v nu were determined to adopt a racist attitude\ntowards the incident, it would\nhave been more correct to\ndescribe it as the Black Hong of\nKong. Your article has been\nmisunderstood by some people\nwho I am sure you did not mean\nto hurt. I feel it necessary to say\nthat no mainland Chinese were\ninvolved.\nTours, sincerely\nDon Munro\nWarden\nWeeks Workers Collective\nDear Mr Marshall\nI am writing to protest against\nwhat I regard as misuse of your\nposition as Editor of FELIX in\nthe recent controversy with Dare\nAfolabi. In particular, I am\nappalled by the three cartoons in\nthe last issue which accompanied\nany reference to him. It is\nnotoriously difficult to know\nquite where to draw the line\nconcerning the racist, sexist\n(etc.) content of cartoons, but it\nseems to me that you have opted\nto use any tactics, including\noutright racism to discredit Dare.\nEven the fact that he isn't the\nproud owner of a traditional\nBritish name like Dennis or\nDesmond is used against him.\nAnyone who has had any\ncontact at all with Dare will\nknow that phrases like \" a compulsive liar of the most\ndetestable kind\", \"crackpot\", or\n\"jerk\" don't fit at all. I suspect\nthat it is the fact that he is\nChairman of African and Caribbean Society which has become\nactive on issues like South Africa,\nracism and overseas students,\nand is actually trying to do\nsom thing within College that has\nattracted your detestation.\nI ask for an apology for your\ntreatment of the argument;\nespecially for the three cartoons\nprinted in FELIX last week.\nTours sincerely\nOwen Greene\nPhysics PG Dear Mr Sieve Marshall\nI must observe that the article\non page ten of last week's FELIX, concerning Dare Afolabi\nand its accompanying cartoons on\npages One, ten and eleven were in\nvery bad taste.\nThe cartoons, Stanley, are\ndistinctly racist and imply that\nthe black students in College are\nof doubtful character and have\nganged up to harass some white\nperson. Incidentally, Sam, is the\nperson represented as being\nharassed supposed to be Mr Williams or you? If the latter,\nthere is no hope yet. (I bet you\ndidn't understand that.) In\naddition, the letter directly\ninsults Mr Afolabi, who was\nreferred to as a 'jerk'.\nLastly, Sidney, I want to\ncomment that your editorship, in\nmy opinion, has given FELIX a racist feel, what with the Kosher\nGown and Gang of Three story. I hence look forward to next year\nand a different sort of FELIX. K Frimpong-Ansah\nElec Eng PG PS:\n1) West Indian World costs\n15p not 30p( weekly).\n2) The Union allocated the\nHaldane Lib \u00a3 1 5 6 . 5 5 , not\n\u00a3120.00.\n3) The magazines asked for\nwould cost \u00a339.60 not \u00a347.40,\n4) We did not ask for all the\nmoney to come from Union funds. *\nSir\nYour present campaign against\nDare Afolabi is disgraceful. Some\nof the things you have done in the\ncourse bf it are tantamount to\nsuggesting that he is not only a \"compulsive liar of the most\ndetestable kind\", but a negro as\nwell! Both these charges are as\nunjustified as they are scandalous. Mind you, I couldn't help laughing.\nTours faithfully\nPettifogger Jarnoyce, BSc\nDear Sir\nThe impression I got from BB\nWolffe's column last week is that\nGay News is bought from funds allocated to Haldane Library, and not by members of\nGay Soc. The African-Caribbean\nSociety, on the other hand, is\nbeing asked to buy copies of\nWest Indian World and send them to the Haldane Library to be \"kindly\" displayed.\nWest Indian World is a newspaper\nread mainly by British blacks just as Gay News is read by British\ngays. If it is accepted that blacks\nang gays are minorities, is it not\nonly fair that the same set of rules\nbe made to apply to both groups?\nIn any case, the one-sided\ntreatment given to such an\nimportant issue by your columnist\nis most irresponsible. Instead of\nserving as a forum for healthy\ndiscussion, FELIX is now being\nused as a vehicle for spreading\nthe private prejudices of a few.\nJ Antonio\nMech Eng PG\nSir\nLike many other people, I am\namused by the current misunderstanding between yourself and\nthat upstart Dare Afolabi.\nI should like to remind people\nthat the whole affair began when\nyou kindly decided to include in\nthe Freshers' Issue four paragraphs (c350 words, compared\nwith 36 words for the Latin\nAmerican Soc) of an article on\nthe Afro-Carib Soc. This was\nunnecessary anyway, as there\nalready was an introduction to\nthat society in the Handbook.\nAfolabi started to complain and\nhas continued to do so ad\nnausea m.I suggest that he would make a lot of people happier if he\nrefrained from nit-picking in the\npages of FELIX. As he seems interested in legal\nphrases I will remind him of\nCicero's well known dictum:\n\"Salus pop ulis u prema est lex\".\nTours, against self-opinionated\nforeigners\nPatrick Coll,\nMaths 1\nDear Mr Marshall\nPage ten of last week's FELIX reads more like an extract from a National Front paper. Racially\nmotivated derogatory references\nand cartoons were made about\none \"Dennis\" or \"Diogenes\" by\nBB Wolffe. In view of the usual\ncry for racial harmony in this\nsociety may I ask why BB Wolffe\ndid his piece. Or is he saying that\nthe cries are crocodile's tears?\nIf BB Wolffe wasn't up to some\nmischief he could have made or\nproved a point against Dare\nAfolabi other than resort to\nirrelevant cartoons. What is it\nthat made\" Dennis\" the\n\"Menace\"? Or is BB Wolffe's piece simply in keeping with the\nattitudes of his type that the\nminority who demand a right or\nmake enquiries constitute a menace or swamp the society?\nDare and the Haldane Librarian\nand others concerned were still\nengaged in discussions on the\nenquiries Dare made about the\nabsence of African ''Caribbean\njournals from the Library when\nBB Wolffe took it upon himself\nto sentence Dare to monkey-like\nmenace in cartoons.\nBB Wolffe had better make his\nposition clear. He is, of course,\nentitled to his opinion, but he is\nnot entitled to make the student\nnewspaper an organ of racial\ndisharmony. It is relevant to\nmention here that the DareF E LIX series started when the\nEditor Marshall deleted a paragraph on South Africa from\nan article submitted by Dare\nAfolabi, the Afro Caribbean President, for the first issue of\nFELIX this year.

Two hours later, he was returned with all\nbodily appendages still attached.\nGuilds romp home\nwith carrot!\nThe City & Guilds float at this year's Lord Mayor's Procession\nOn Saturday the C& GU took part in the Lord Mayor's Procession, the event started with Guilds returning City\nUniversity's old mascot (taken last year) the Carrot.\nWhen the procession got underway Guilds found\nthemselves rather disconcerting ly behind the Salvation Army\nBand.\nThe lunch break at Kings College saw a brief altercation\nwith Barts Hospital when shaving foam flew. Nevertheless,\nthe Guilds float continued, arriving back at the Barbican\naround 1:30pm. As a finale, Guilds took the fateful step of\ntaking City University's new Carrot and bringing it back to IC\nLast year, at the Lord Mayor's Show, Guilds stole City' s papier mac he carrot. However, City did not want it back after it had been painted in Guilds colours and made another one. This carrot was stolen on Saturday when City left their float unprotected. Obviously incensed at losing their precious vegetable, they rang up\" the IC Union Office in the guise of Algerian students and made an appointment to see John Passmore about' the Algerian Situation'. Of course, the person they were really after was Dave Gayer. Guilds President. Said imposters turned up at the ICU Office at11:45 pm to encounter Mr Passmore. bag of chips in hand. On discovering, his ident itv. Mrs Hardy Smith was thrown to the ground and foamed and the President whisked away amid the shaving foam, confusion, and Mooney chips. Jen Hardy-Smith.\nAnnie Lath a en, Union Receptionist, described the raiders as\".... Big' Uns \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 one even had a stocking over his face!\" John Passmore, glad to be back at IC\nAt12:45 pm, a mystery phone call was received by Annie. The caller said:\" We want our carrot back.\" Annie, suspicions aroused, asked for further details. Annie told the City raiders that they had got the wrong blok e, broken the lockon the Union Office door which they would have to pay lor and asked lora letter of apology and bunch of dow ers to be sent to Mrs Hardy Smith for her rough treatment. And no, they couldn't have their carrot back because we a in' t got it.\nMeanwhile, back at the City ranch, Mr Passmore was telling the raiders just how many years they would get for the damage to the Union Office and assault on Mrs Hardy Smith. And that they' d got the wrong chap anyway. Eventually, the raiders relented and released Mr Pas smote on the promise that he would td vert is c their Saturday night concert( they gave him four posters!) and sell 1 0 0 RaK Mags. As two of the raiders drove the President to there arol the Union Building they spotted Dave Gayer( the person they really wanted) walking down the road. Still, it was two against two now and they drove off cursing heavily. No 56? Friday, November 14,1980 Free!\n\n"

    "content": "i Man of Steel\n\"The Steel Closures\" conference organised by the IC Industrial\nSociety was opened by Sir Charles Villiers, ex-Chairman of\nBSC. Sir Charles began with stating that steel production has had to be\ncontinually dropped due to greatly diminished demand for steel resulting from aUK\" de industrialisation\". Sir Charles said that, though he hated having to carryout closures, they were inevitable in the light of the declining market and old equipment being used. He said that the majority of the workers were in favour of closures\nas they realised that the production costs were not low enough and the plants were not modern \u2014 The opportunity of a new life and job due to redundancy payments is\nmuch better than staying in a dying works. Sir Charles then spoke about the\n\" survival\" of those people out of work. The BSC Industries Ltd was set up by Sir Monty Finn is ton to\nencourage new small businesses to\nstart up in the old steel works.4,000 applications were received to\nstart new businesses of which420 have been given support which have provided12,500 jobs. Mr Martin Upham, a coauthor of the IS TC publication\" New Deal for Steel\" then spoke on the background to the closures, and the\nalternatives as seen by the union. The delegates then formed work groups to discuss the closures in economic and social terms. On returning to conference it was found that both groups had difficulty in reaching a concrete decision. However, the consensus of opinion was that the cuts had become necessary, although the\nmethod ol carrying out the closures was not wholly approved. Man at the top\npromoted\nMICHAEL ARTHUR will be moving from his present office in the Union Building to Prince's Gardens. There he will join the Residence Office( which will also be moving) as Residence Officer, taking over from Claire Cri pp s.He will still be fulfilling his function as Welfare Officer; he said\" the Union will be gaining a Residence Officer, not losing a Welfare Adviser\". He stressed that the grouping of all the counselling and residence facilities under one roof in Princes Gardens would give a much better service to students. In addition he felt that in future there will be more consultation between the Residence Office and the Union. The appointment will commence in December. Claire Cri pp s will be moving to\nregistry as an assistant registrar; she said that she was quite looking forward to the change. Wainwright\nvisits\nIC\nTHE LIBERAL MP for Colne Valley visited Imperial College on Thursday, November6 to address a meeting of the Liberal Club. He chose as his subject the need lor electoral reform. His main argument was that no previous government had been able to pursue a radical policy because they did not genuinely represent the view sol the electorate. \"Gone are the days,\" he said,\" when an Act ol Parliament alone could impose a point of view upon the electorate\". He envisaged a much healthier system if Proportional Representation was used at elections; it would mean that there would be a great diversification of the political spectrum occur ing alongside the fragmentation of the major parties. Teddy Taylor\nTalks\nTHE CONSERVATIVE MPl or Southend spoke on Tuesday to a Conservative Society meeting taking as his subject' A Radical Approach to Nuclear Power'. He talked lor twenty minutes to a packed Maths139( It's not up to us\nto count them - Ed).\nHis arguments were mainly centred on the certainty that fossil fuels would run out and that nuclear power Was the most cost effective method of replacing them; in addition it would be valuable to the Third World as\nan energy source. He raised several contentious issues, notably that overseas aid should be replaced with free trade un hampered by\" that bloody Common Market\". He wanted the' principles of Adam Smith upheld and not the trivial alterations. This was presumably a riposte to the interventionist policies of past administrations. Council Report\nThe second Union Council meeting of the year took place\nMonday, November 10. As is usual, the meeting occupied\nmost of the evening, from about 6.15pm until 9.15pm, during\nwhich a large volume of material was discussed and approved.\nJohn Passmore in his report, concentrated on Student Union financing and Council agreed to postpone contrib j ting to aUL UL SO campaign fund until more information was known. In addition, the situation on Residence deposits was clarified; Don Mon row as reported to have agreed that the simplest method would be for deposits to be lost. Mr Passmore also reported that the new security system, with its key card access after lOp m will be in operation from November17. The money that should have helped a Third World student this session, had one been selected last year, will go forward to provide for a second place next year, along with that collected this year under the WU S scheme.R aeS nee reported that in the first six weeks of term, the machines in the lower lounge had brought in a poi it to ICU ol \u00a3 1 , 7 5 0 . The turnover of the Southside shop had reached a respectable figure, she said, and was improving. Perhaps the main area of interest in Liz Lindsay' s report was the imminent demise of IN COST. Only thirty delegates had committed themselves, this Liz said was insufficient and unless at least fifty\ndel gates are definitely coming by November;31, then the IN COST conference will be scrapped. After these reports one of the more contentious issues of the evening arose, the discussion of major claims where a representative of the Pedal Car Club attempted to refer the report back to UFC because the club had had its claim rejected. Miss S nee appeared to agree that had the claim been for an entire car rather than its component parts it\nwould have been approved. The proposal was turned down. Council also approved the purchase of100 pewter pots from Engle lie lds at\n\u00a3 1 8 . 7 5 each. In a separate resolution it was decided that Snooker Club should be given the I CW A Lounge if UFC approve the purchasing of a new Snooker table, I CW A would then be found another room. Within the officers' reports there were several points of general interest most notably the failure rates which were;7.2% for the first\nyear;4.6% for the second year;1.4% for the third year. The number of overseas students fell from994 to 773 this year. The final major piece of business was a discussion of the amendment to the UL U Constitution to be voted at a special meeting on December1. This would mean th a tULU sabbaticals wood be elected by students with hustings probably at each college. It was decided to ma date our delegates to vote for the amendments. Stephen (lott td cr Guilds 3 counties rally\nLast Friday night various assorted members of the Motor Club\ndescended on the sleepy town of Odiham in Hampshire for the\nstart of the second round in this year's rally championship.\nThe event took place in spite of the fact that one local resident,\non hearing that this dastardly event was go in t to take place, had\nthreatened to apply for a High Court injunction in order to stop\nthe rally. Although he had no legal ground to stand on whatsoever\nthe organisers decided to reroute the rally in the interests of\npublic relations. gone into the back of another The first car left the start at competitor, but after he' d reversed11:31 pm followed at minute intervals\nby the rest of the field. For the next couple of hours the twelve cars stormed round the country lanes( often in completely different directions) but eventually they all\nmade it to halfway, except one Datsun driver who had as light contretemps with a hedge. Most of\nthe competitors were treating the\nslippery conditions with a healthy respect although there were a few\nwho were tackling the course with much verve. One competitor driving a beaten up Mini Clubman beat it up a little bit further with a spot of bank bouncing as he threw it through the\nbends( that was before he had nearly into a telegraph pole).\nSo at 4:30am, eleven cars with\nrather tired competitors came\nstaggering into the finish. Most\npeople agreed that it had been well\nworth while and very enjoyable in\nspite of the relatively tough navi-g ation.

This has been\nreaffirmed by the Committee of Vice-Chancellors\nand Principals and I await a reply from the DES.\nIn an address given by the Chairman of the UGC to the CVCP it is stated that the UGC do not\npropose to earmark sums for students unions but\nfor the first year will 'indicate' the sums included\nin the grant for that purpose. Colleges can then\ndecide to give more or less as they see fit.\nSecurity\nThe security services have now been finalised and will come into operation on November 17. All\ndepartments shall close at 10:00pm every night\nincluding weekends. Those in departments before\n10:00pm will still be able to leave after 10:00pm, but access after 10:00pm will be restricted; those\nwho wish to gain access after 10:00pm any night\nshould see their department. Southside main\nentrance will be manned throughout each night\nand other security guards will patrol the area.\nOverseas Students\nOverseas student numbers have dropped by\nabout 2 5 % overall. Undergraduates are down\nabout 10%. MScs are down about 4 0 % as are\nresearch numbers. The full reduction in\nundergraduate numbers will only really be known\nin 1982/3 when the full cost fees have been fully\nimplemented.\nSuggestions and Complaints\nWe had a very productive meeting on Monday,\nNovember 10, where we discussed Southside\nRefectory and the Shop. The Southside Refectory\nhas had several complaints about the food being\ncold and small portions being given. Mr Mooney\ntook the complaints to show to the staff in\nSouthside. (To have a good laugh, or to improve\nthe situation? - Ed.) The Shop is running a Christmas raffle with first prize of a Christmas\nhamper worth \u00a315.20. Tickets are given free for\nevery \u00a31 worth of groceries. The raffle will be held\nat the Christmas Dinner-in-Hall for which tickets\nare now on sale.\nIf suggestions and complaints are to have any\neffect they should have the date, the suggestion\nor complaint and the person's name and address\nso that replies can be sent out. However, if your\nfood is cold or has something wrong with it the\nbest method is to take it back immediately and\nask for it to be changed.
