    "content": "\\o FILMS rr\nFELIX\nTHE CRITICS\nLA DONNA E MOBILE\n\" yell x meets Calamity Jane\" i a dismissed by some so ep tlc s as \"just\nanother cartoon\", but beneath its numerous surface there is S recurrent\nnote of gravity.\nThe eternal mental conflict when\n\"boy meets girl\" is portrayed in cartoon form. Psychologists hare expressed a mass ment at the clarity with which\nthis Idee fixe is presented. There is an undertone of frustration and d is content throughout the entire film, an\nindication of the hyper aes the sia to\nwhich the mind of the would-be lover\nis subject.\nThe film is a fantasy created by\nthe love-sick youth and is an excellent example of what psychologists\nterm\"w l sh fulfilment\". The setting is immediately romantic: boy meets girl in distress, girl weeping and ugly\n(a problem with which the learner-lover is not uncommonly confronted\nIn his dream world he solves the problem by substituting a dream girl.( This exemplifies the subconscious\ncompensatory mechanism which attempts\nto protect our dreamer from harsh reality.) The girl is lonely, unclothed and\ndefenceless, but in this idyllic world\nour dreamer is chivalrous Instead of\nlicentious. He endures many hardships\nto clothe her in finery, but inevitably he is spurned by this femme fatale\nand is brought back to the horror of\nhis real world.\nRECORDS ~\nA recent record I have received\nfrom the Docoke Recording Co. i a an excellent example \" of jazz chamber mus \u2014\nio. This is an extended player (45 rpm)\nand presents American ballad forms,\nenriched rhythmically and melodically\nby the Kinsey Sex-t ct. The vibes are played in a truly ethereal manner; the ectoplasm!c vi bratt ions permeate one's innermost being,\neven to the very soul. The emotional\nbalance is manta in ed by an extended\nrhythm j sequence provided by the drums,\nbut the contrapuntal technique is used\na little excessively in the recapitulation. This tends to disturb the deli cate balance between harmony and caco-phony, and allows the sex-tot to go for o of fee.( Both sides of the record sound\nde oid ed ly better when played at 33rpm \u2014 off centre).\nIC MUSICAL SOCIETY\nCAROL CONCERT\nMON.

Ah, you say, another\nclassical slob: but no, bear with me\na little longer friends. Being the season of goodwill to\nall men, and women, I have decided to\nforgo my prejudice and go in search\nof Modern Jazz.

Modern jazz,\non the other hand, is in an eternal\ntransitory state:- a crashing coda of\ntinkling timpani o an be transformed spontaneously, into an alert allegro. There\nis no rigid mould into which this jazz\ncan be poured; on the cont s ary,a very\nhigh degree of elasticity, an infinite stretching in almost any direction,is\nconsidered quite legitimate.\nBOOKS ~\nEXTRUDED CAMBRIDGE DICTIONARY\ndictionary, n.

A Carnival\nis what yon make it, and it appears,\nthat everyone came with a one-track\nmind - er - to let themselves go'.\nThe majority of the revellers were\nin fano y dress - a very welcome change,\nsue no doubt to the Ancient Greek\nchoice of theme. Sheet togas were by\nfar the most popular dress, albeit leaving portions of the anatomy exposed to the occasional beer storm and\npassing breese. Some of the females\nsported a quite eye-catching lack of\ndress.\nThe cabaret, under the c irc um stan ces, was excellent; the c irc um stans s s being, of course, that the cast was\nblind drunk. The 'drama tis psr so nae* were all outstanding, especially \"Ivy\",\na girlfriend of Mr Hobson. Any inhibitions due to stage fright disappeared\nas quickly as Ivy's dress (she was\nalso wearing a bikini, we hasten to add). Mr Hewson, a very smooths type,\ncomp ered effectively from a bath and\ndemonstrated with Ivy's help the ins\nand outs of Pythagoras. The lid was\ntaken of fI.C. life, and the appearance of Prank, our dearly beloved Warden, on atypical hostel bedroom scene\nwas greeted enthusiastically. A down\nand out band of dilapidated Grecian\nstreet musicians, Mr Chadwick (looking\ndelightful in a knee-length toga) on\nthe euphonium; Mr Stevens on the trump-et; and Mr Gorb on the drachma-whistle.\nThe show terminated in a lusty (and\nlust is the operative word on this oc-casio n) Boomal&ka.\nAlthough the bands were playing\nuntil5:50 a.m. not many dancers were\nleft at that hour \u2022\n- quite amazing where\nbodies get to'. Mr Gorb found a few in the s nog ger y at 7:00, and the lounges\nwere positively littered with them. I. have it on good authority that the jazz\nband effectively prevented Q.A. from\nsleeping that night (do Q.A. sleep at\nnight?).\nAll in all, a very successful Carn i val; certainly most of the maidens\nseemed to be satisfied. DEBATING TOURNAMENT SUCCESS\nI.C. were drawn against Royal Free\nHospital School of Medicine in the\nfirst round of the U.L. U. debating tournament.. The debate was, held as one\nof the popular lunch time debates at which over 100 members were present\nin the house. At lunch, the chairman of the judges, Miss Ruth Lloyd,\nproduced three sealed envelopes wh i oh contained different motions. Royal\nFree won the toss and decided to oppose,\nso Mr. Peter Kassler, President of the\nLit. and Deb. Soc., was left to select\nan envelope which contained, the motion:\n\"This house prefers a knave to a fool J The two teams were then taken to the\nGeology Dept. where they were allowed\nfifteen minutes to digest their meal\nand to prepare their speeches.\nAt 1.20 p.m. the debate was opened\nin the Geology I^o ture Theatre by Mr.\nD.E.H. Jones who took the chair as Mr.\nKassler was participating as a member\nof the team. Mr. Les Allen.who led\\ he I.C. team,opened the proposition\nwith a famous quotation admirably sui ted to the motion: \"Mary had a little lamb. . .\" He then followed this superb\nverse by attacking statesmen and politicians and listing them all, save Mr.\nGo its k ell, as either fools or knaves!\nThe opposition from Royal Free pointed\nout the harmlessness of fools as found\nin undergraduate life compared to tha\nknavery of criminals. Mr. Terry Smith\nseconding the proposition dealt with\nthe possibility of reform of knaves by\ntreatment and kindness while fools\ncould not be corrected even with the\ndrastic measure of a leucotomy.s The attack for the proposition was\ncontinued fr or? the floor by Mr. Peter\nKassler and Mr. Bob Fiiich. Mr. Kassler'3 flattery to the charming chairman of judges, Miss Ruth Lloyd,did\nmuch to show that chivalry and debating tricks are far from dead at I.C. Mr Finch reminded the house of the wisdom of the \"Knave of Hearts\" in s tea ling pat is serie. The opposition, apart\nfrom some go one ry in an attempt to make\nthe house sym pathis e with fools, found\nthemselves slightly lost with the mo-tion. At one point one of the speakers\nwas so perplexed that he proceeded to\ntie a knot in a shoe lace.\nIn a brilliant summing up, Mr.\nLes Allen proceeded to pull to pieces\nthe speeches from the opposition unt il it appeared that their case was\nquite false. At the division which\nfollowed the motion was carried by 106\nvotes to10. The three judges, Miss\nLloyd, Mr\". Peter Jarman (I.C.) and one\nfrom the R.F. H. unanimously awarded\nvictory to I.C, FELIX PHOTOS Any persons who have ordered FELIX,\nphotographs this term are asked to\ncollect them from J.K. Taylor as soon\nas possible.

Dramatic Society was fortunate to gain third place in the\nUniversity One Act Play Festival held\nlast week ax U.L. U. The play, Percival Wilde's \"Comrades in Arms\" was a happy choice in that is an amusing,\nif at times ob v loK B, comedy giving\ngood scope for acting ability. It makes the most of the situation: a gallants young colonel of the Talaverian army tries to win the love of\na major's widow, Elena, whom he has\nvatche d through the window with the\naid of powerful field glasses, by\npretending to have been the late ma-jor' s closest friend, with him when be\ndied gloriously on the field of battle. The discovery that the major died\nwhile drunk and that the picture on\nthe wallis not of the major but of\nhis father does not deter the colonel in the least. Unfortunately,\nfull use was not made of the situ a tion in the production. The set, though\nsomewhat peculiar, achieved a fair measure of success, partly due to the\ncontrast to the unimaginative use of\nthe stage by the other companies.\nFrom his amusing entrance, Derry\nWright as the colonel brought the play\nto life with his good sense of timing\nand o on tro l of voice and movement. The\ntwo women, Elena and her maid, were\nrather weaker, but will make good actresses under tighter production and\nwhen they have gained more experience,\nPeter Morgan gave a competent performance as a true to life photographer\nAs was sadly evident at this Festi val as a whole, more thought must be\ngiven to production, especially in det ails of action and In the development\nof plot and character.

    "content": ", . . o outlined fro a page 8\nable to earn good money, keep It and\nkeep it good. To this end Liberals\nsuggest Government help to enterprising\npeople who wish to start business in industry and agriculture; the granting of generous loans for house and\nfarm purchase; the encouragement of profit-sharing and oo-ownership in industry, by the removal of tax ob s tao les to them; and a general reduction in taxation. A fallin the oost of li ving and a phenomenal rise in production\nwould be apparent in a matter of months.\nBut what about the less fortunate\nindividuals, in difficulties through no\nfault of their own? This is where the\nSocial Services, originated by Liberals\nbefore the 1914-18 war, come into play.\nThey were intended to help people to\nhelp themselves - pensions and subsidies are required for the unlucky, injured, old and sick, not for everyone\nregardless of means. It is rid icu lou f to sub sid is e uneconomic projects indef-in it ely in peacetime; instead the money should be invested in capital equipment for the Industries our island can\ncope with.\nTO bring about these changes without strife or hardship we must continue to improve basic Education and extend Education in technology, industrial management and Trade Union procedure as much as possible. We must\nalso provide temporary higher unemployment pay to help people to train for fresh jobs and even move house in the\ntransitory stage.\nLiberals believe in freedom for the individual above all. A person\nshould be able to work, worship, save,\nspend and generally live as he wishes,\nnot as bureaucrats called the State\ndemand. Therefore the freedom of\nindividuals must be guaranteed by a. proper balance between their rights\nand the claims of Government and Looal\nAuthorities; it is Parliament's resp on sibi lit y but Parliament at present\nreflects group interests above the common interest, is- hand io app ed by an outdated committee system and is neither\nrelieved of much work nor fairly advised by an ever on or sided House of Lords.\nSome degree of Parliamentary reform and\nthe granting of more responsibility to\nLocal Authorities in certain fields, so\nas to bring more ordinary o it is ens into\nLocal Government,would be worthwhile.\nFinally, individuals need much stronger\nlegal protection against the tyranny of\nemployers, Trade Unions or Trade Associations. This, incidentally, would\nbe another advance in the direction of\npartnership between all employers and\nemployees.\nSimultaneously Britain must pursue\na realistic course in foreign affairs and remember that people of all nations\nhave the same rights to freedom. Military and economic force and colonial ism lead to chaos when Imposed upon\nanyone, but honest trade and co-oper-ation yield peace and prosperity.There-fore Liberals say join in the Free\nTrade Area, Buratom and the Schuman\nplan with enthusiasm and, from experience, lead them to success; seek\nfreer trade throughout the world; work\nfor international treaties to guarantee\nfree aoc ess to vital raw materials\nsue h as oil; and co-operate with the\nCommonwealth and N.A.T.O. in defence.\nMost important of all Liberals believe\nin seeking peace by negotiation, first with the Commonwealth, Europe and the\nU.S.A. and then with the Communist cou-n tries. The U.N.O. is the medium for this and it will fail if it is not used\nand its decisions are not adhered to:\nit is the duty of each one of us to\nserve, directly and indirectly, all INTERNATIONAL organisations and causes\nwell.\nE.E. Johnson.\n, FELIX THE\nSUGGESTIONS\nBOOK\nREVIEWED\nWhen Mr. Briggs first produced it in October this year, this volume was\nimmediately recognised as indispensable to the I.C. student. In his foreword Mr. Briggs relates how, on\nreturning from strenuous activity in the gym, he was frustrated in his attempts to buy soup and milk; with\nths money he thus saved the book was\nbrought into being.and christened\nwith a stream of pent-up complaints\nand the odd pent-up suggestion. In more serious vein Mr. Briggs explains\nto us how inflation hits the student\ntwice over j prices go up, parents\nincome goes up and grants come down!\nA large part of the book deals\nwith the complaints and part l cula ry interesting is the chapter on peas.\nMr. Mooney*s peas have been variously\ndescribed as lead shot, green\nbullets and indigestible ball bearings,\nbut all contributors agree that they\nshow little resemblance other than in size and shape to the natural product.\nAs they are quite inedible this form\nof fish and chip decoration is a luxury we o an do without. One contributor asked, in rather bad taste,\nwhether they were in fact made from\nreal peas or from some synthetic\nformula for which I. C.R. holds the\npatent. The Catering Sub-Committee\nremained ominously silent on this matter, but it pointed out -that garden\npeas would increase the cost of a dish\nby 3d. It is pleasing to note\nthough that evidence of the last few\nweeks indicates that a compromise has\nbeen reached, and the peas, if not\ntasting of the genuine article, are\nat least edible.\nAlso interesting is the chapter\non dessert spoons, which hostel\ndwellers find to be excellent dual-purpose instruments also suitable\nfor soup. In contrast, patrons of\nthe lower refectory object te using\nsoup spoons for eating th air Bakewell\nTart and have been clam our ing forM \u00ab MooNty;\nThe author of these remarks was told to return such dishes to the counter\nand help to maintain good standards,\n\"he remainder of the book is largely e ducat ive in nature and it appears that FELIX has reached the J status of a learned journal, readers\ntwi oe being referred to FELIX (Issue\n113 p.l. col.l.). Also the eating habits\nof domestic animals do not interest the\nCatering Sub-Committee and correspondence on such matters should be sent\nto the Id it or of FELIX. In which\ncase would that gentleman care to note\nthat on 18th. Oct. 1957 a wood louse was found exploring the suet pudding\nand two days later five cockroaches\nwere found in the refectory. Elsewhere we are informed that a question\nof supply and demand determines the *\nBrinell hardness of chips and that\nthe square on the cut side of a sandwich\nis equal to the sum of the squares on\nthe crusty sides. As a finale duc mati ve extract we quote:- \"For some time\nI have been confused regarding engineering terms - e.g. ductility, rigidity, tensile strength, hardness and brittle ness. Tour pastry demonstrates the lot, Tet tills is not an entirely serious\nvolume, for it has its witty moments i Comment:- My ice-cream was Berved\non a cold plate.\nReply:- We will try to ensure that\nthis will never happen again.\nComment:- Re my comments on pages\n7 and 8, your reply \"See page4\" is useless.

The Catering\nSub-Committee claim they are attempting\nto deal with the shortage, but teem\nto be in some doubt as to whom they s re supplying spoons.\nPerhaps as typical of the s so tion dealing with ths complaints we may\nquote:-\"The white of an egg was rubbery,\nthe yolk more so.

To judge\nfrom the Explorations Board's in-tray\nonly a follow-up expedition of are search nature which,might well have\nbeen backed from other, sources, is forthcoming.\nSurely research projects are not\nthe only thing wh i oh can come from\nI.C.'s once teeming brain. The Explor ation Board has been criticised for not broadcasting the fact that funds\nare available, but surely there are\nsome members of the College enthusiastic enough to enquire: the original fund was brought about largely through\nthe efforts of a couple of keen stud-ents.\nThe Bxploration Society is being\nformed to encourage the formation of\nplans for future expeditions, to pass\nLIMERICK COMPETITION\nThis year there were no outstanding\nlimericks in the printable section.\nM.J. Blacker produced two quite reasonable attempts which could have been improved but nevertheless gained him a prize of one bottle of brandy, which he\nhad better collect from the Editor soon.\nThe unprintable section produced\nsome limericks of a rather higher order ,\nThe first prize goes to Chris Gravina\nfor a student who took a dumb blonde\nfor a walk (and found she wasn't so\ndumb). Will he please collect his banana from the Editor's fume cupboard.\nMT Gravina also produced easily the\nmost revolting entry.\nSecond place was shared by B.F, Channon, whose student learned his lesson the hard way, and John Dell: \"Did desperate things with a fork.\"\nA clever young student from York\nOnce pierced his leg with a fork.\nHe said \"Oh, dear, dear\nThey'll all think I'm queer\nWith four holes and a comical walk.\"\nA clever young student from York.\nWho was addicted to baked beans and pork\nOnce lay on his turn pork\nIn the boiling hot sun\nAnd brought down two MiGs and a hawk.\non knowledge gained and to promote\nwider interest in exploration in the\nCollege. Two major expeditions having\nreturned, each catering in the main for specialist interest, it is hoped, that\nopposition from the ^vested interest\"\nof the mountaineering and depart a mental groups will be dropped.\nOne hopes that the new Club will be as independent as possible of the\nExploration Board. It will be a student\nsociety and as such we wish to remain\nfree to make our own decisions and criticisms, although we should be very,\ngrateful for advice from the experienced\nexplorers at present on the board.\nIt would certainly be very useful\nfor a future leader to feel that he had\nthe weight of a lively student body be-hi in d him if he got mixed uc in the\nmere bureau or a tic tram ra el ling s0f the\nBoard.\nXenophon.\n1, Is there going to be a decent library in Prince's Gardens,,or is the ex-is ting Union Library, for all its qualities with the limited resources at its disposal, going to remain the sole outpost of English Literature and Art in the College?\n2.

Reader.\nOur Architectural Correspondent writes;\nEnquiries have shown that ft t the\npresent there are no plans for incorporating library facilities in the Halls\nof Residence. Any such facilities that\nmay be provided will be on the central\nsite. Music rooms are planned on the lower\nfloors of the South block, what they\nare, and how extensive thc;rrna y be is not known.

We hope the planning office or the\narchitects may be able to enlighten us\non these points in the near future.\nquestions\nDear Sir, At the Rector's College meeting, time\nfor questions seemed to have been deliberately cut short. Was this a means of\no voiding any critism, it certainly seemed to be so from his look of surprise\nwhen the question of a swimming pool\nwas raised.

    "content": "FELIX a uB Review? THE CHRISTMAS ISLANDER\nTE, the in Law it ants of the third Christmas Island set amongst the coral reef of the new aeronautics Building,\nrejoice because our season is close\nupon us. It is the season of Santa\nClaus and cur long lost relatives, of\nhurried buying at Marks and Spencers\nand pound catching with the Post Office but it is also the time when we Islanders, like shipwrecked mariners from\nthe seas of science, can escape for a full three weeks to the palm trees and\ngolden sands of our island. Upon\nthis cradle of truth and light, our\nminds o an muse upon the beautiful, the\npleasing, and the mysterious as we have\ndone for all too 8hort periods in the\nshadows of the all too real Imperial\nOollege.\nAS I.C. MEN\nAs one gases round the quad, with\nits truly distinguished surroundings,\na dismal sight greets one's eyes.\nPeople rushing to and fro, mainly men\nclad, sad to relate, in anything from\nboiler suits to filthy old sports Jackets. Perhaps one can excuse the boi ler suits with a Carnival at hand;\nsome-one has to work. But who could\nexcuse those baggy trousers which have\nprobably never seen a press - that\nfilthy shirt that remains concealed\nfor days on end underneath the ever-present sweater. A frequent cry heard\nin I.C. is \"More women, more women\",\nbut who could possibly expect to attract a woman in that state. I can\nonly suggest that Education Authorities increase their grants to cover\nsuch minor details as hair-cuts.\nAnother remark frequently heard is\" If I lived In the Hostel I could wear\nany old clothes; it is only because I travel that I put on my clean shirt occasionally.'' (This is an authentic\nquotation). This rather suggests that\nto live in the hostel induces one to\nassume a state of extreme filth and\nuntidiness, but in fact the standard\nIs practically the same in or out of\nhostel. One could excuse casual clothes\nif they were kept clean, but this is far from the case.\nAnother sad thought comes to mind\nwhen one considers the very respectable\nattire seen at a ball or dinner. I can\nhonestly say that quite a large per*\neen t age of these people are absolutely\nun recognisable when not wearing their usual clothes. Perhaps the old saying\nthat evening dress \"does things to a man\" is only too true.\nTo conclude: since the occasional\nwash Is obviously unpopular, I can\nonly recommend that undergraduate gowns\nshould be introduced - they are excellent dust covers.\nSabrina\nDr.'a all an and Blaokaan have visited Christmas Island this term to chat\nabout Victorian nationalists and Oanse\nand Chance. These gathering* filled the Physics library wh i oh was disguised\n\u2022as the beloved island; other gatherings, jibbed and jabbed at the Islanders' own prose and poetry and also\nhad a taste of a Tchekov or two. A particularly vague paper was read by\nan Islander on Twentieth Century Oascurantismand the third Christmas Is land will be finally submerged far195? with the Touchstone Secretary, Mr.C.K, MoDowali, speaking on ' A Penny for the\nOld School' - a defence of classical education and literature. This will be at 5.45p.m. on Tuesday December 10th, In the Committee Boom off the lower\nUnion lounge.\nA veteran Islander,\nDavid E.H. Jones, is experimentally to exhibit his experimental cartoon films\nat 5.15p.m. the previous day in the\nsame room. Prospective Islanders are\nassured of a genial welcome at these or\nany other of the Island gatherings.\nAs you eat your turkey bone, think\nof us Islanders basking in the Winter\nsunshine of the Christmas Island; we\nshall i not think of you until the dreaded Januarv 7th. Peter Jarmac.\nMINES BALL\nIn ay opinion, as an outsider but\n% frequent visitor to College Balls v rer the past four years, this year's Mines' Ball was an unqualified success. Tha novel idea of having the bar\non the stage and the orchestra on the\nside of the floor had the effect of\nbreaking up the box-like appearance\nof the Concert Hall, and imparting a feeling of unity that has generally\nbeen lacking at College Balls. Prom\nthe bar it was possible to watch the\ndancers and join in when moved by the\nspirit. There was ample seating in the\nHall and the Bar, so that the fun of\nthe Ball could still be enjoyed while\nresting. Attractive decorations, a good orchestra and a general feeling of conviviality nil went to make the\nBall the success it un doubt ably was.\nMay there be more like it. Caroline Duttson.\nFAME\nThe December issue of MDTCB SPOBT\nincludes a photograph of Jezebel cross ing the finishing line at the end of\nthe Brighton Bun. Tha owners of the\nDennis fire engine are asked to write\nin and give various technical details, such as the petrol consumption.

Winter Athletic Competitions.\nIn the field events seo tion of last week's a th let ios at Mbtspur Park, I.C. showed up rer r badly against other\nUniversity Colleges and Hospitals, being placed 6th,in the \"Tjalve Trophy\"\ncompetition. Two members of our team\nfailed to arrive on time, thus throwing\naway points. The only event wh i oh we\nwon was the hop, step, and jump, in which Dave Smith and a promising fresher\nJohn Constable were placed 1st. and 4th. respectively, with leaps of 43'11\" and\n40'5\". A good effort by regulars John\nNewman and Bob Lloyd brought us Srd.\nplace in the shot, but the only other\nplace which we obtained was 5th.in the\ndiscus with Newman and Harry Abbott,\nwho is now back with us after a year's 'rest'. Our long jumpers and javelin throwers were badly off form and in the\nhigh jump we could not produce two\nJumps of 5'0\" - which incidentally\nwould have gained 5th. place.\nIn the relays, however, the sprinters are to be congratulated on running\nexceptionally well, a just reward for\nthe regular training which most of them\nhave been doing on the track. The team\nwas composed mainly' of fresher s Dave Jones, Keith Ludlam, and Chris\nWarren - and with U.L. sprinter Bernard\nCurtis and J miler Pete Goodwin to\ncomplete the team, they came 2nd. and\n3rd. in the 4 x110 and the 220,220,440\nrelay finals. However, due to a poor\nperformance in the long relay ( 880,880,\n1 mile) in which we were only 4th. we\nlost the Belays Cup by one point to Kings' College.\nThe lesson to be learnt from this opening match is that if we are going\nto regain the University Champs. Cup\nin may, our field events men must\nfollow the example of our- sprinters\nand train harder. Regular indoor sessions of only 30 minutes on the'I.C.C i rou lt will pro ges siv ely build up\nstrength and stamina throughout the\nwinter, and opportunity for coaching\nIs provided by the U. L.A.C, who hold a coaching week on 14th18 th. April at\nHotspur Park, national Coaches are in attendance at this very Inexpensive\ncourse and athletes live in at the\nground. This course is always very pop\nu lar many people go every year - so\nearly application is essential.

Women's Swimming\nClub has entered the University of\nLondon Women's Swimming League. This\nyear, however, they are forming a joint\ntes a with Middlesex Hospital Medical\nSchool, since both experience the same\ndifficulties in forming a team every\nweek. So far, the results of this\nterm's matches have been most enc our aging. In these three matches,\nI.C. W.S.C.' a contributions to the team\nwere Janet Petersen, Judy Lemon, Hilary\nTompsett and Pat Herman.\nI. C.*M. H.v. Kings' Won 29-20\nI. C.aM. H.v. U.C. Lost 20-50\nI. C.AM. H.V. Westfield\nWon 31-22.\nSOCCER Por most of the matches this term\nthe 1st. II forwards have accepted most\nof their chances at goal, scoring 49\ngoals in12 games. For the last two\nmatches, however, while the defence hat\nplayed soundly and general tactic shav been good, the forward line has missed\nmany chances. This was particularly evident against Varndean, Brighton,\nwhere I.C. attacked continuously with\nopen football down both wings. Suffi cie nt chances were created for over'\na dozen goals, but I.C. had to be\ncontent with two, one of them scored\nfrom a penalty by D. Joyce.\nAgainst L. SJS. on Wed.27th. Hqv.\nthe result was a draw, 0 - 0 , this being\na fair result in a game in which both\ndefences were in control. For a period\nof 20 mins. in the first half, I.C. applied constant pressure on the opp on ents' goal and could well have scored.\nI.C. defeated Kew Association 4 - 3\non Sat. 23rd. Hov. in what was a very\nenjoyable fixture, suitably concluded\nby a pleasant evening at the \"Cobwebs',\"\nRichmond.\nThe 2nd. II, although heavily defeated by Clement Danes G.S., who will oppose I.

Nov., in a quadruple match\nagainst Southampton, Cranwell, and\nRanelagh, I.C. produced the strongest\nteam to appear this season, due partly to the a bse no e of aU.L. fixture, and\npartly to the match being an unofficial trial for the Club's first team in the\nUniversity Champs. The result was a glorious vio tory for I.C. with the\nwhole team of seven Inside 30 mins.\nand all producing personal best performances. J. Collins, Inside 28 mins.,\nwas 4th, J. Conway 5th,R. Landbeck 8th, and other I.C. positions 12th,15 th, and 19th.in a field of 40 runners.\nThe defeat of Southampton University\nwas particularly pleasing, as they\nprovide tough opposition for the U.L.2 nd. team, and they won the Hyde Park\nRelay last year.\nOn 30th. Nov. the Club easily defeated a rather weak Romford A.C. team\nin an uneventful match, except for a fantastic effort by Keith Wall, who\nachieved a time of 28m.40s. and earned\na place in the I.C. first tes a for the\nU.L. Champs.\nAgainst Westminster College on 20th. Nov. I.C. had an easy win; the individual winner was John Collins. Three of our members were in the\nUniversity team wh i oh lost to S. L.H. on 30th. Nov. John Collins, the I.C. Captain, ran extremely well to finish in3 rd. place, and was the first ff.L. man home.\nThe University Championships are\nbeing held tomorrow, and the Club's recent improvements indio ate that we\nhave a good chance of winning for the\nsecond year in succession. Our only\nserious opposition is likely to oom es b. from L.S.E. who also have a strong tea\nthis year, and the result may be very\nclose. The strength of I. C.C.C.C. is shown by the huge entry of seven teams.\nRIFLE CLUB Record Score Against U.C.

In closing, the\nSector stressed that the present plans\nare not in their final form - they are\nonly the plans in the form that they\nhave been submitted for approval. It had been suggested that they should\nhave been made public before, but he\nasked how this could have been done as\nthe plans had only just been published,\nRichard Sheppard was absolutely\npr ioe less, and he kept his audience\namused the whole\"time. The last occasion on wh i oh he had had to speak was\nwhen he was trying to convince his oli ents of the suitability of his plans\nfor building some oo who use3. These\nwere high class establishments, and the\neconomic rent for a cow was \u00a35-10s. The plans included a laboratory for art io i al insemination; he felt that this would in no way satisfy students, and\nassured us that we would in fact get\nthe best that oo ul d be provided.\nSTOCKHOLM . . .\nThese introductory remarks were\nfollowed up by as e leo tion of colour\nslides* ef student Hall3 of Residence\nin other parts of Europe. Deserving\nparticular mention are the Domus in Stockholm, the re star aunt of which is advertised by a large neon sign, which\nalso serves to guide students homewards\non dark nights! We may very well get one ourselves. The idea of let*ting rooms in summer to visitors from\noverseas seems to be still. a distinct possibility as by that means a much\nbetter return on o a pital could be ob-tai ned, and this would please the Treasury. In Sweden students spend seven\nyears in college, and it has been found\nnecessary in Stockholm to build an enormous b look of flats for married stud-ents. In fact, It seems that on going up to College as single students,\nmen put their names on the waiting list for flats, so that when they are ready\nfor one they will be able to get one\neasily. Eaoh of these flats has a small ki to he net te and a private bath-room. A slide of atypical room,\nwh i oh had its own private shower and\nwashbasin, together wi;th ample ola thing cupboards and book space was also shown.\n. . . ASD PARIS\nSgmont in Copenhagen is run as an\nhotel in summer, and this is found to be a worthwhile proposition. The\nstaff situation is so lvs d by employing\nstudents as waitresses and porterS|\nth sy get tho necessary training in a special o our se lasting about a week or\nten days. This Hall was eight stories\nhigh, had lifts to all floors, and included dining rooms and similar community facilities. Another University\nthat had b sen visits d by Messrs. Sheppard and Sparkes was the Cite Univerai t aire in Paris. 0ns of their Halls\nof Residence three stories high, was\nan extremely elegant design by Le Corbusier. Another eight stories high\nand housing 2000 students was just ths\nopposite in design. A long, massive\nand uninteresting building,. its facade\nwas broken up by ba loonies and other\nfrills. The hostel was for both sen\nand women students, all allegedly liv i ing in single rooms. The s sx es were\nnot segregated into differ nt areas but\nwere randomly scattered through the bu-il ding. The whole building had an\natmosphere that was, to quote Mr Sheppard 'quite indescribable and most interesting.' The French were very re tio ent on the subject but one oo ul d draw\none's own conclusions from the number\nof couples that ate together at lunch\ntime, together with their children in many cases, and from the large c reo he and nursery that was provided as one of\nthe facilities of the Hall. The Cite\nUniversitaire was an enormous project\nand even had its own station on the\nMetro. The dating facilities, however\"\ncaused the largest amount of eye opening.\nIt was to be hoped, Mr. Sheppard felt,\" that I.C. should never sink to the\ndepth that this refectory reached. On\ncoming in with the girlfriend and baby\none is served oaf e teri a wise, stainless\nsteel tray-plates being used which have\ndepressions for soup, meat course, sweet\nrolls and butter, etc. They served\n3000 lunches an hour in one large room\nand, as oo ul d easily be imagined, the\nnoise was indescribable. He had observed one couple eating a banana in a most curious fashion, starting one a tea oh end, and working inwards until they\nin the middle. (The banana was shown\n.OB one of the slides.) Two of the\nmain items on the menu which cropped\nup very regularly were steak and chic-ken.\nas innS L OF WBESM HALL\n(from the Planning Office exhibition)\nMr. Richard Sheppard now spoke at\ngreater length about the Prince's Gardens pro j eot. Lifts would, he said,\nbe installed in all Halls, together\nwith common room facilities and refectories. The existing Garden would be\nretained, and would be mainly for the\nuse of residents. This would be the\nfirst London square which had been rebuilt as a homogeneous unity. Most of the oom mun al facilities will be situ a ted in the south b look. Ao ert a in number of shoos will be incorporated, including a barber's shop. Dining Halls\nwould be built in small units so that\nnoise levels can be kept down to tolerable limits; associated with tien wo\nwould be bar and buttery. These, together with co-u it tee, music and dark\nrooms would be situated on the Lower\n(mews) level. Car parks would bs situated at the rear of the Bast block,\nand it was hoped that a cycle repair\nshed might be possible. The road on\nthe Bast side of the s iu ire would be\ndosed to vehicular traffic and that is)\nths south side would become purely an\naccess road to tn s oar parks and the\nSouth b look. The North-side road would\nhowever have to remain, as it provides\naccess to Enniamore Gardens. The\nchange in the roads had, he said, al ready been approved by the L.C.C. QTBSfI0B\" TIME\n'As f. result of their travels round Europe, Messrs Sheppard and Sparkes\nhad come to the conclusion that rooms\nshould have a floor area of between\n120 and 150 sq. ft. The present plans\nwere based on an area of 140 ft. super\nwhich is the minimum area recommended\nby the Ministry of Eduoation: however\nthe U.G.C. seem to think otherwise and\nare trying to cut us down to120 sq. ft The architects next worked out what furniture was required, and could be fit ted in conveniently. As a result of experimenting with numerous small models\nthey had qom e to the cono lu sion that\nroom dimensions of about 14ft. by 10ft was about the most suitable as it gave\nthe most economical arrangement of\nspace. The furnishings had been under\nclose investigation owing to the except ional standard of strength that is required for student-type furniture. It had been found that art iole s manufactured to British Standard Specifications\nwere not nearly strong enough, and that\nmuch more rigid specs, were necessary.\nThey had decided, that put-you-up type\nbeds were whole ly unsuitable; because\nafter four years' use in other hostels\n\u2014 they were virtually worn out. Divan\nbeds will probably be provided.\nSPORTS CLUB\nIt is planned eventually to in corporate a sports club in the North\nside buildings.

It was the Rector,without whose\nforesight there would have \"been no new\nresidential plans being made at ore sent, and Sichard Sheppard,the architect,\nwhose foresight and imagination had\nbeen widely acclaimed, who deserve the\nhighest praise. Dr. Sparkes was also\nwelcomed to the oom ple ted Union bu il ding, and it was to be hoped that he\nwould never again have to face a rest ive crowd of students, as when he had\nhad the unenviable task of explaining\nwhy the Union was not finished on time.\nHe felt the importance of the meeting\ncould not be overestimated, and reminded everyone of the serious problem of\nhostels in London.\nDEVELOPMENT\nDr. Linstead said that Prince's_ Gardens would be one of the finest res-ident i al developments in the country,\nand that if it were not. it would not be\nfor lack of trying. He briefly summarized the history of I.C. hostels.\nThe Old Hostel was built in1926, and\nthe New Hostel followed shortly after wards. The policy had always been\nthat Hostels were desirable, and that\nthey w hould be situated somewhere near\nthe South Kensington site. Much later Selkirk Hall was opened.\nAt the beginning of 1955 approximately 100 were living at South Kensington, and in the original development\nplan Residential Accommodation had bee;;\npla oed second to academic... However when\nhe, Dr. Linstead, was appointed Rector,\nhe thought that the two should have\nequal importance. At this stage there\nwere two plans under consideration:\n1) Raise Be it Quadrangle into a Union\nand Hostel only, and have minor developments elsewhere.\n2) Develop the whole of the Beit Bu il ding to the fullest extent, leaving the\nBotany departments as they are, and\nthen have a large development elsewhere.\nThe governors were in full agreement\nwith the Bcasor and when the Univers it y Grants Comnittee visited I. C.at the end of 1955\" the deplorable state of\nour residential accommodation was will rubbed in. U.G.C. was shaken, and\nvery'soon agreed in principle to the\nscheme. A search now began for a suitable site; by an interposition of\nprovidence Prince's Gardens came into\nthe market at almost the same time\nand it was picked up like a ripe apple.\nU.G.C. managed to get the money out of\nthe Treasury and the site was bought in1956. The idea than came that in drawing up the plans they might as well do the job on a proper scale and not\nmuck about.\nMINE'S A MINER R. SM AT BEDFORD MEETING A certain handsome mining geologist has been elected \"Beau of Bedford\" for the\nsession 1957-58, \u2022 Last week he was invited to lunch at Bedford College and be presented with his prize at their Union Meeting immediately afterwards. Because 0fa shyness and modesty becoming to such a man, the \"Beau\" was allowed to invite a few\nfriends to the Meeting to provide moral support while, in addition, P.W.G. W.,a Prominent Mining man, accompanied the\nGUILDS CARNIVAL\n\"Beau\" to the luncheon for\nreason (presumably).\nthe same\nSEE STORY OH PAGE 2\nIOOO IN RESIDENCE\nThe number of students\nliving an digs is steadily rising, there now being 61\"' as opposed to 42\nafter the war; there is thus a stead-i ly increasing amount of suitable\nHostel fodder. The Governors aimed\nto have 1000 in residence finally, and\n500 definitely by the end of the quin-que n niu m. This was their minimum aim,\nand they would try to exceed it if that were at all possible. By the end\nof 19^6 plans had been provisionally\nagreed upon by the L.C.C. and TJ.G.C, thus by a concatenation of circumstances\nmuch had been achieved.\nThe question next arose of the\ntype of Halls of Residence required:\nafter much thought it was decided to\nkeep the social life of the College in the Union, and to plan the Halls for\nstudy bedrooms only, together with\nsufficient eating facilities to serve\nthe residents.\nPLANS APPROVED\nThe present position was that no\nmatter what the Treasury said, we would\nbe getting at least Week'sHall, with\n70 more rooms, which ..ou ld be very we l come. Demolition on the East and\nSouth sides of the square and on the\nsite of Week'sHall would be starting\nin January, followed as soon as pos-sib le by the actual building. The\nplans as they stand at the moment have\nbeen commended by the Royal Pine Arts\nCommission, which in itself i a no mean\nachievement, and have been approved by\nthe L. Q.C. The plans are now before\ncontinued on page 4 . . .\nAccordingly a band of happily pri med and be-topper ed Prominent Mining\nMen, some nineteen strong, were suit ably conveyed to Regent's Park in the\nlunchtime of Thursday, Nov. 28th. An\nenchanted Bedford College witnessed\ntheir arrival and reunion with the well\nfed hero. The latter was shortly afterwards triumphantly chaired (by two\nof the Stronger Prominent Mining Men)\nto a place of honour on the dais be-fore the assembled Union. This entry\nwas marked by deep gasps of admiration\nand the muffled thunder of throbbing\npulses.\nThe perspiring Support Party seat-ed themselves along the reserved front\nrow and the secret ritual began. There\nwas a fighting speech of welcome from\nMines' Buxom Sweetheart, and an introduction of our hero by the Most Prominent Mining Man: \"He is a very notable\nMines' Kan. Prom his windswept hair\n(most difficult of all styles to ach-i eve), to the toes of his gleaming\nHessians, he poses as the advertisement\nfor the Man of Fashion. His waistcoat\nwa3 chosen with a nice eye; his beer\ncoloured pantaloons show not one crease.\nNo amount of studied nonchalance, no\ntailoring, can conceal the muscle in his thighs, or the strength of his\nshoulders. Above the starched points\nof his shirt collar, a weary, handsome\nface shows its owner's disillusionment.\nThe \"Beau rose to the occasion\nmagnificently. In a short and witty\nspeech (writes Our Special Correspondent) he suggested. The Buxom Sweetheart, enthralled, kissed all the Prominent Mining Men. In the case of\ncertain Avaricious Prominent Mining Men\n(one of them married), she kissed them\ntwice.\nWith the discretion that marks\ntrue gentlemen the visitors departed\nwith their Champion to the nearest\nhostelry. Here the \"Beau's\" newly\nacquired hockey stick and string of\nsausages were examined. At the bottom of the hockey stick was found the\ninscription: \"Honi s olt qui mal y pens e.\" STOP PRSSS See page 6\n\n"

Tne\nSociety was happy te entertain so a any visitors from other colleges - over\ntwo hundred people attended. The even-lag got off to a good start with a canoe 'Oberek' by the TJ.L. Polish Soc.\nfolk Dance Group, who later gave aKS XM spirited performs nee of the 'Kratow-lak< - a Polish 'Teddy-Boy' dance and\na 'Chlopak Podolski'.\nThe evening continued with a duet\nay two very attractive>girls and some\npiano solos which provided a pleasant\nchange of mood. After the interval the\nSsymanowski Choir sang some delightful folk songs and carols. The M.C., Mr\nT. Wisniewski, deserves special mention forMs wit and informality.\nHiss, Renata Bogdanska, the Radio\nsad T.V. star concluded the programme\nwith four encores from her repertoire\nef Polish, Italian and English songs,\nand the evening ended happily in a e of fee bar in South Kensington.\nThe motion before the house at\nthis term's Union Debate was \"That\nthis House has no confidence in Her\nMajesty's Government.\" Austen Albu\n1C.P. and P. Jarman proposed the motion,\nand it was opposed by W.H. Rees- Davies\nM.P. and T.C. Smith.\nMT Albu, an ex-Guildsman, opened\nwith a witty indictment of the Government, but pointed out that , since\nHer Majesty's advisers had appointed\nhim a governor of this College, he\nwa s in a rather bad position if he\nquestioned their judgment. He then\nproceeded to a serious condemnation\nof Government policy over the Bent Act\nat home and Cyprus abroad.\nSt Hees-Davies also opened in humorous vein with a story of a student debate at which he had proposed\nthat \" it is possible to have a better\ndirty weekend in the Backs at Cambridge than in Paris.\" He went on to\nPCS. SMOKING CONCERT\nAt the commencement of this popular event the Concert Hall was well filled, as also were the glasses -there being free beer or cider for those who desired it. The President\nof R.C.S., in his capacity as M.C. declared that he considered the cultural level of the Smoking Concert\nshould be ral sed. On considering the\ngeneral cultural level of the various\ndepartmental shows it is doubtful\nwhether anybody else was of the same\nopinion.\nAfter a Brownbagger's Declaration,\nthe R.C.S. Skiffle Group appeared. At\nfirst they were inaudible but improved\nas time pa'sed and even collected some\nmoney. The general feeling seemed to\nbe that they overstayed their welcome,\nthere being cries of \"Enough,enough\".\nOther features before the interval were \"How aPi lm is produced\" by the\nChemistry department, a chilly looking sculpture exhibition and a Russian\nScience laboratory. Hell Harrison and\nAndy Mathews played stalwart parts la lowering the st a iw l \u00abrd to rock bottom.\ndescribe the Conservatives as heirs to\nthe Liberal tradition and maintained\nthat Government policy in Kenya and\nCentral Africa was truly liberal in its outlook.\nTo MT Altai's surprise, Mr Jarman\nhad no confidence in the Government or\nthe opposition. He emphasised his opinion that a Liberal government would\nbe the only desirable one, while Mr\nSmith defended Government policy on\nthe conventional grounds that while\nliving conditions were not perfect,\nthey might be much worse.\nAt the conclusion of the paper\nspeeches, a full House proceeded to\na lively discussion of the motion;\nthis continued until3:10 p.m. noteworthy was MT Allen, who passionately\nadvanced the cause of equality of opportunity and of giving help to the\nunderdeveloped nations. Other views\ncame from Communists and Liberals, as\nwell as Conservatives and Socialists, although the Conservatives produced a greater proportion of the voters than\nthey did of the speakers from the\nfloor. The House then divided, the motion\nbeing carried by 70 votes to 52 with\n14 abstentions. At the opening of the\ndebate over 200 members were present.\nBARDOT AT I.C.A very successful series of Saturday night hops ended for the term\nwith FELIX'S Birthday Dance (FELIX is now eight years old), The Bruce Gayler band provided the music for the\ndancers in the Concert Hall, while\nthe Jazz band played in the Upper Refectory for a short while before the\nInterval.\nThe second year Chemists' comic\nopera \"The Rake's Progress\" received\na great ovation. It consisted of miming to current popular tunes j the\nsynchronisation was perfect. The leading part was excellently played by Ken\nPacker. The succeeding \"Restaurant\nScene\", also a Chemistry production,\nprovided Dr. Dennis Evans with an\nopportunity to eat a candle, an electric light bulb and a drinking glass. As a finale he took a mouthful of liquid oxygen and proceeded to blow it through\na lighted cigarette with somewhat\nsp eot aou lar results.\nA NIGHT YOU WILL\nREMEMBER\nWILL BE\nFRIDAY 31st JANUARY\nTHE\nENGINEERS DINNER &\nDANCE\nMAKE A NOTE IN YOUR DIARY NOW\nDuring the interval the Jazz\nBand worked through their repertoire\nwith Tony Hodgson taking the lead on\nhis clarinet. The second half of tiro concert\nstarted rather slowly with a French\nscene played in and around a cloche-merle-type equip page. However, a short\nrecitation by Amos helped to restore\nthe cultural atmosphere:\n\" It gave the family quite a start. When Angela became a tart ....\"\nThe Zoology department showed t their baseness by giving their impression of I.C, nightlife. The second year Geologists\nshowed their great versatility. After starting with dancing girls, one of whom had a beard, they continued with ballet. Their main feature \"This is your Life\" was a Summary of the past life of IvorBottom\nplayed by Nell Harrison. (Voice from\nthe audience: \" If that's\" \"what they teach\nyou in Geology,God help you\").\nDuring the interval a film show\nwas held in the tt pper Refectory. With\nbated breath, the l.r gc and appreciative audience followed the fortunes of\nFelix the oat in a neo-futuristic drama\nof outer space and a sex-laden romance\nwith Calamity Jane,\nLater in the evening several spot-dances with a difference were held.\nOne lucky fellow won a dance with Miss\nBrig it Bardot, but his joy was short-lived: no sooner did he stretch out\nhis hand to her than she turned into\ncardboard before hi a very eyes. Another couple won a large banana, which\nthey then proceeded to eat, in the\nFrench fashion (see page 4) while dancing round the -floor. Other prizes\nincluded an inflatable sputnik (by\narrangement with Mike Todd) and two\nglasses of FELIX punch to be drunk\nstraight down. The recipients were\nswept up the following morning.\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX\nPOLITICAL FORUM\nA NEW CONSERVATISM\n\" It's the same the whole world over.\nIt's a shame life ain't so ni de; But you 'as to grin and hear it, Or pay a bloody pr ioe.\" There is a political spectrum, and\ndifferent types choose different colours\nFirstly, there are th oss who like their politics cut and dried: they accept\nthe underlying assumption behind some\npolitical theory and then rely on logi o al developments for answers to soo i al and humanist problems; Scientists\nmight find this method attractive. A whole mass of jargon and sometimes meaningless terms have evolved from their arguments. Others, influenced by up-bringing, parents' political opinions,\nand (unconsciously!) the psychological\nlabel they bear, just are what they are\nand remain so for the rest of their lives, with few exceptions. Some,\nwith the independence of youth, react\nwith varying degrees of violence against\ntheir domestic political atmosphere,\nmany people, in many ways sensibly but\nin other ways unfortunately, take little Interest in politics. They find the\nsubject boring and are generally apa-the tic unless events manage to strike some chord of emotional fer v our. \"They\" are then blamed \"or everything;\n\"they\" in their turn blame economic and\nsociological entities. The real scapegoat may not even exist. Finally there\ns re lovers, warmongers, and mathematicians, who never play fair and have very\nwidely varying shades of opinion.\nCynics and \" intellectuals* wil xp rob mbl\" not be reading this article. Let us forget, for a moment, the\nexistence of this political spectrum\nand give a little tho ;gh t to the fol lowing point, which we think is best illustrated by ao ert a in aspect of college\nlife. The student at I.C, is being\ncontinually presented with new amen-i ties. He has a new Union, new laboratories and lecture halls, new Hostel s etc. In fact, during the last few\nyears student life had been endowed\nwith a good deal of almost luxurious\nnecessities. Is the recipient of\nthese items any happier? One only\nhas to read FELIX to find out that;\nhe has found considerably more to comp la in about. He has become a good\ndeal more critical and there is a danger of him becoming too much the\nfault finder. Of course, while we\nhope that students will appreciate and\nvalue their ever expanding college, we\nthink that the fault of becoming too\ncritical i3 an eminent one in the 'out-side' world. Although we should strive to make our country a better place to\nlive in, we must always be aware of the\ndanger of making the man-Tin-the-street\ntoo fussy and too ready to blame that\nscapegoat called authority. What the\n'new Conservatism' is in fact aiming\nto do is to encourage the individual\nto think about his personal responsibilities not let the 'State' think\nfox him. (One of the most controversial examples of a personal responsibility is that of providing for one'sold age by family saving, not by indiscriminate, compulsory, impersonal\nState schemes.)\nConservatism aims at preserving\nthe best in capitalist society, parti cula rly the individual drive and cha-rac ter. There are real dangers of\n\"big business\" and the trade unions alternating in their control of the co un try'sea ono my, although the worker is agreed to be winning the battle. Unfortunately, this tragic strife ha a degenerated into a political slang ing match. Nationalisation moans ever-increasing power for the State and lar ge numbers of both small-time and\nbenevolent capitalists will suffer.\nIncreasing automation is a problem\nwhich will have to be solved regardless\nof the prevailing political system.\nWhat is needed is an essentially pragmatic approach to these, and other\neconomic difficulties, bearing in mind\nthat a government's job is to rule and\nto uphold the law, and not to act as a charitable institution. Peaceful co-exist ince, and not expensive indulgence\nin dramatic \"coups\" which do not come\noff, should be the keynote of Conservative's new foreign policy. The old School tie, imperialism, colour prejudice, fanatical patriotism, feudalism,\nplutocracy; all these have been popularly associated with conservatism in the past. Looking into the future, if our country is to survive in an expanding world where individual freedom is not forgotten for emotional theories\nbased on past mistakes, then our new\nconservative policy must irrevocably\nwipe out these aspects. Otherwise\nconservatism it doomed to failure. \"Liberty means responsibility. That\nis why most men dread it.\" 'Maxims for Revolutionists.' Shaw.\nR.B. Williamson\ntile Bow Socialists believe that\nmost sf ths ills of capitalism have\nsees solved over the past few years.\nThey consider that the long period of\nfull employment and high living stand-ares in Britain Is net temporary.\nTHE NEW LIBERALISM\n\"Science has created a new world. The\nkey to it is nuclear power. We have\nto live in that world - to turn it from a terror into an opportunity.\"\nJo Grimond.\nThis is not a statement of Liberal\npolicy. I wish to give you some idea\nof the lines along which liberals are\nthinking and working towards the goals\nof Liberty, Opportunity and Security\nfor everyone in Britain and throughout\nthe world.\nThere is not enough friendship and\nco-operation in our society todays elf sacrifice and small acts of charity\nare sadly lacking. It is a general\nattitude, only too evident in a large\ncity like London and reflected by crime\nstatistics and cruelty to children and\nanimals. It is an attitude wh i oh will not go until we have freedom in the\ntrue Liberal sense of the word.\nA Liberal Society - one where\nthere is a maximum of opportunity and\nsatisfaction is the ideal of millions.\nIn it racial and class distinctions\nhave no place. Any person should be\n, , . continued cn page 9\nroot. It Is to be hoped that the Con*\nserra ti ve Government's refusal to negotiate on the suspension of n roc'* \u00abr tests will not prevent our sleeting a Government of lew Socialists. Judy Lassen\n(Ian. See. I.C. See. See.)\nTHE NEW\nThe Parliamentary Labour Party was\nfounded in1919, because of th\u00ab need\nfor working class representation in Parliament. It took as its basic objects the Social Ownership of the\nmeans of production,.distribution and\nexchange. Most of the impetus for the\nacceptance of these objects was emotional rather than rational* Emotionall y, the working class reacted against\nthe obvious unfairness of capitalism as it then existed. But the political movement did have the beginnings of a theoretical basis. This theory came\nfrom consideration of the recurrent\ncycles of booms and slumps. In the\ncapitalist system, the profits of\nbusiness lay in the hands of a few.\nThe value of a commodity is decided\nby three things: wages, necessary in vestment and profits. Thus it1 Bev ident that if unnecessary (from the\neconomic point of view) profits are\nmade on articles, then the total amount of money In the consumer market cannot buy back everything pro-duce d. This leads to over production\n( strictly speaking, under consumption)\nand businessmen lay off some of their workers. Unfortunately, this further\nreduces the \"\"mey of the consumers s at slumps oc j.r hls was described as\n\"the inherent contradiction In capitalism - abundance of commodities means\npoverty for the majority of the people.\"\nOn this problem, the Labour Party\nis divided. Some members consider this theory of crises to have been d is pro v ed, as we have had a comparatively\nlengthy period without slumps; others\npoint to factors suggesting why our\nnext slump has merely been postponed\ndue mainly to the constant demand for mors armaments sines the war, and the\nhuge demands for consumer goods due to\nthe unparalleled destruction caused by\nthe last \u00bbar, and they point to the\npresent situation In America to justify this. SOCIALISM\nRather than talking about changing the\nsociety, they are therefore more concerned with reforming and improving\nthe existing society. The policies they advocate are moderate enough to\nattract the middle class voters; and\n.radical enough to maintain the support\nof the working class.\nTheir moat important proposal is contained in the document \"Industry and\nSociety\" which outlines the programme\nfor acquiring shares in firms - mainly\nthe inefficient firms. Although it is not intended, In any case, to acquire\ncontrol over the firms, it is hoped\nthat even the threat of such action\nwould force employers to consider their\nworkers' interests more, and lead to\nbetter worker-management relations.\nSuch a policy attracts the working\nclass, for in this way they will have\na greater say in the management of industry, whilst not alienating middle-class voters. This ha a been done even\nby Tory governments, as in the eases\nof the Suez Canal Company and the\nAnglo-Iranian Oil Company.\nThe money to acquire shares will come from the surplus cn Labour's Superannuation scheme. Every member\nof the community will contribute to wards this central fund, which will be used for investment. The profits from the investments will provide\nguaranteed pensions for everyone. In\nthis way, without alienating big bus-it as s, every worker will be secure in bis old age. This scheme is modelled\non a similar one introduced by Br Adenauer' se j or ern ment in West Germany,\nand is ths main income-raising side\nof the Sew Socialist proposals.\nWhen the Labour Government takes\noff ioe( sometime before 1960) these\nproposals will be put into effect and\nit will he seen whether their theories\nor those of the Old Socialists are cor-\n"
