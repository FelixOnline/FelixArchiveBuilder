If this is your first time\naway from your parent's home you\nwill probably be 'surprised' by the\nstandard of accommodation.\nThe Imperial College prospectus\nproudly guarantees you a room in\nits or an Intercollegiate Hall of\nResidence. Although the\nIntercollegiate halls are of a slightly\nhigher standard and offer the chance\nof meeting students from other\ncolleges in London, they are not\nsituated in the South Kensington\narea.\nThe Southside halls of residence\nhave been described as 'shitty'.

But\nwith 60 people sharing one shower\nand two gas rings in the basement,\nany environmental health officer\nwould close the place down if they\nsaw it.

If you can not\nafford the \u00a360-80 for a single room\nin this area, prices fall as you move\nfurther out or south of the river into\nBattersea and Clapham.\nHowever the state of\naccommodation in London and the\nstate of the halls of residence are\none of college's best kept secrets.\nIf you, or your parents, knew how\nmuch time you would spend\nworrying about accommodation,\nthe amounts you would pay and the\nstandard you would live in they\nwould ensure that you went to\ndifferent University at the other end\nof the country where you can have\na single room in hall for around \u00a340\n26.

Alex lives rough, Michele\nhas decided to join him on the\nbridge he lives on which is closed\nfor repairs. Michele is an artist with\na degenerative eye disease who has\nchosen to live her last days of\nsightedness on the streets . Alex\nearns money by doing a breathtaking fire-eating act on the\nstreets of Paris.\nThe first half of the film is spent\nexploring the characters and\nfollowing the development of their\nrelationship. We then have a rather\nhurried story that involves the\npossibility of a cure for Michele's eye disease, Alex trying to hide this\nfact from her, for fear of losing her,\nand the result of him being\nsentenced to prison. She is cured,\nhe's out of prison; will their love\nprevail?\nThe plot and characters of the\nfilm are original and engaging, but\nalong with this the spectacular and\nTheatre\nFelix 943\nimaginative visual and musical\ncontent make it a film that I would\nhighly recommend. It's quite a long\nfilm and a little uncomfortable at\ntimes. If, like me, you 'lose'\nyourself in films, you might find\nthat your concern for Alex and\nMichele's survival in their brutal\nenvironment distracts you from\ntheir love affair.

It then\nplayed the Edinburgh Festival\nwhere it was a complete sell-out\nsuccess.\nThe whole play is a monologue,\nperformed excellently by Tom\nHickney. He is a funny little man,\nin his own attic talking away to\nhimself, engaged in an imaginary\nworld of ritual and abuse. He is\nexploring the lay r in th of fear and\nhatred which is the essence of\nmisogyny. He is definitely different\nfrom the usual character who\nexpresses his misogyny in heroic\nviolence. In the course of the play\nhe is tracing paths from patriarchal\nreligion to crimes against women.\nSo at the end that little man is not\nfunny any more.\nAccording to M Harding, he\nwrote this play especially in order\nto offer some challenge to the\nperformance skills of Tom Hickney\nand he has certainly managed it.\nZorbas.\n\u2022 T/ ie Misogynist is on at the\nBush Theatre, Shepherds Bush\nGreen, London W12, Monday to\nSaturday, 8pm.

    "content": "Clubs & Societies\n9th October 1992 Felix 943\nHellenic Society\nIn March 1984 the London Times\npublished an article on the\n'phenomenon of Athens College',\nunder the title 'The Secret of\nContinuing Success'. The article\nstarts: 'Of mathematics scholarships\nawarded by Trinity College this\nyear, three went to graduates from\nAthens College. Another graduate\nfrom the College won a top\nscholarship in Physics to Balliol,\nOxford and five more leave rs are\ncurrently keeping their fingers\ncrossed hoping to win scholarships\nat Imperial'College, London'. So\nimpressed was the London Times\nwith the results of the Athens\nCollege graduates. But as the article\nstated; the success was not\ntemporary but continuing. The 1984\nyear was neither the start nor the\nend. The academic year 1985-86\nwas even more successful with five\nstudents with Imperial College\nscholarships. The success continues\nreaching a peak in 1992 when 11\nstudents were accepted to Oxford\nand Cambridge, 8 to Imperial and\n4 to the LSE to name only some of\nthe best universities in the UK and\nundoubtedly some of the best in\nEurope. The reason is easy to\nunderstand. Only in 1990 the first\ntwo students graduated from the\nElectrical Engineering department\nof Imperial College were Athens\nCollege graduates. For the 1992\nclass Mrs Skillman, current head of\nthe GCE department, said 'This\nclass did superbly, the results are\nprobably the best in history.'\nSo, do not wonder if you see\nGreek students walking in the\ncorridors or in the refectory\nwearing with pride t shirts with the\nAthens College shield. And even\nmore the Athens College fresher s should not be surprised by the\nreputation and fame that Athens\nCollege has among the British\nUniversities.\nBut what makes Athens College\nso successful?\n'A combination of talented, handpicked teachers, a first-class GCE department, high standards all\nround, and students eager to work\nharder than average'. Every year,\nmost of the highly selected\nAmerican universities such as the\nMassachusetts Institute of\nTechnology, Harvard, Standford,\nPrinceton, Yale, and Cornell award\nscholarships to Athens College\ngraduates. Former American\npresident of Athens College, Dr\nSummerskill points out: 'The\nAmerican universities know that\ngrades here are meaningful'.\nEver since it was founded 67\nyears ago by a small group of\npublic-spirited Athenians who were\nsoon joined by Americans, the\nCollege has sought to impart 'the\nfinest academic training in Greece'.\nGreek and American educators\njoined forces in a rare experiment\nof bi cultural cooperation.\nThe College is situated on a40 acre pine covered hill in Psychico,\nnorth of Athens, and its main\ncampus contains 10 major\nbuildings, a chapel and 7 faculty\nhouses as well as vast sport\ngrounds, an excellent \u00a31.3 million\ntheatre and the largest school library\nin Greece. English is a required\nsubject from the age of nine and by\ngraduation the students must be\neffectively bilingual. About one\nthird of the students who graduate\nplan to go to British and American\nUniversities.\nThis American-sponsored school\nis a non-profit organisation but the\nannual fees are not small for an\naverage family. On the other hand,\na great number of scholarships are\ngiven every year by teh school to\ndeserving students. Most of the\nLondon-based Greek shipowner s who have their children in Athens\nCollege are rated amongst the top\nbenefactors.\nDespite all this, during the last\ndecade the College was badly\nattacked by an 8-year Socialist\nGovernment in Greece with laws\n'which made life very difficult for\nnon-profit independent schools by\nunnecessary restrictions upon\ncurriculum teaching materials,\npersonnel, policy, etc' says the\ncurrent American President Walter\nMcCann. Fortunately, through\ncareful manipulations and\ncooperation, the College managed\nnot only to survive but to expand\nover the years by up to 3,300\nstudents.\nIn closing, Athens College does\nnot finish as soon as the students\ngraduates from the school. The\ngraduates keep in touch, help each\nother and reinforce links through\nactivities organised by the Athens\nCollege Alumni Association in\nGreece and the US. Recently, some\nimportant steps were make towards\nthe creation of an Alumni\nAssociation in Britain.\nExtreme Close\nUp \u2014FilmSoc\nBy way of a special introduction to\nWayne's World, the first film in\nFilmSoc's autumn season, the\nsociety has employed the services\nof one Wayne Nibblet Campbell,\nthe film's star, to give a brief\nreview.

    "content": "'eat ure9 th October 1992 Felix 943\nMusic for all Nations\nNick Allen writes of his experiences with the IC Symphony Orchestra\nas they travel to Hungary and back.\nWhen Ihe idea of taking the\norchestra to Hungary was first\nmooted a little over a year ago, the\nwhole project seemed impossible.\nThe logistics of taking a75 piece\nsymphony orchestra complete with\ninstruments anywhere is an\norganiser's nightmare. Add to this\nthe fact that the orchestra were\ngoing to do an exchange with a Hungarian choir, coupled with the\ncommunication problems that this\nentailed, the tour might never have\nhappened. However, a year later at\nthe beginning of September, the\nBudapest Academic Choral Society\nvisited London to perform two\nconcerts with Imperial College\nSymphony Orchestra, and both\nparties returned to Hungary\ntogether to perform a further three\nconcerts.\nThe choir arrived on Saturday\n12th September, exhausted after a two day non-stop coach journey.\nThey spent a pleasant Sunday on a sightseeing tour and lunching at the\nQueen's Arms. They were joined\nby the orchestra who arrived in\nLondon on the Monday to a busy\nrehearsal schedule, having to\nprepare for two performances of\nVerdi Requiem in this country as\nwell as an orchestral programme of\nworks performed during the\nprevious year for two concerts in\nHungary. Around this they also had\nto fit a reception at the Hungarian\nEmbassy, a welcome party, and a lunch at the Old Bridge Hotel in\nHuntingdon just outside\nCambridge.\nThe choir's conductor, Maestro\nGabor Hollerung, was to conduct\nthe two performances in England\nand rehearsals with him were an\nexperience. With very little\nEnglish, he was able to\ncommunicate his musical ideas with\ngestures, vocal demonstrations of\nthe sound he wanted, Italian musical\nterminology and some german in a way which was able to transcend all\nbarriers between our two countries.\nConsequently, the concerts in the\nRoyal College of Music and in\nCambridge University Concert\nHall, with soloists from the English\nopera scene, were occasions that\nnone of the choir or orchestra will\nforget.\nAfter a two day journey by coach\nwith a stopover in Heidelberg, the\norchestra arrived in Budapest. After\nIn rehearsal in Budapest.\na short wait for the choir's coaches,\neveryone was paired with host\nfamilies, and the hectic schedule\nbegan with a rehearsal followed by\na picnic by the not so beautiful blue\nDanube, cooked by the choir's conductor.\nOn Monday, after a spot of\nsight seeking, the orchestra travelled\nto the town of Veszprem, near the\nBalaton Lake, to perform its first\norchestral concert at the University\nConcert Hall. The programme,\nconsisting of some British works\nrarely heard in Hungary and\nMahler's4 th Symphony, was well\nreceived and the ry th mich and clapping which is the norm in\nHungary, was greeted with much\namusement by the orchestra.\nThe choir had been sponsored by\none of Hungary's leading wine\ncellars, which meant that the\nfollowing day we were taken to the\ncellar just outside Budapest and\ngiven a guided tour by the chief\ncellar master and owner. This was\nfollowed by a tasting session of\nthree different champagnes which\nwas enjoyed by all, and copious\nbottles were bought at ridiculously\ncheap prices. The orchestra then\nreturned to Budapest, where the\nvice-ambassador of the British\nEmbassy, Howard Pearce, hosted\na reception.\nThe Wednesday was probably the\nhighlight of the whole two weeks.\nThis was a performance of the\nVerdi Requiem under the\norchestra's conductor Richard\nDickins in the splendidly ornate\nsurroundings of the Liszt Academy\nof Music. The concert hall was so\npacked that there were people\nstanding in both galleries. Both the\norchestra and choir were on top\nform and we had four of Hungary's top opera soloists singing with us.\nEverything contributed to making\nthis a profound and moving\nexperience.\nThe final day was spent\nsightseeing, and trying desperately\nto spend our remaining Hungarian\ncurrency on cheap sheet music,\ncheap alcohol, cheap food, and\ncheap cassettes and CDs, as well as\nperforming our last orchestral\nconcert in the elegant surroundings\nof the Mayor's Ceremonial Hall.\nAgain, this was well received\ndespite there being the in aug ral concert of a new orchestra in\nBudapest and also a major political\ndemonstration that attracted in the\norder of a quarter of a million\npeople.\nAfter an all-night party, the coach\nstarted the long trek back home via\nHeidelberg, and everyone arrived\nback in London very tired, but all\nenriched by the customs, the\nhospitality, the music, the beauty of\nBudapest, and the exchange of ideas\nbetween two groups of young\ntalented musicians from two\ncomplete lv different backgrounds.\nICSO enjoy the finer things in life.\nPage 6\n\n"

    "content": "Reviews\nFelix 943 9th October 1992\nLigadollopopamudalooza\nFelix went to the Reading Festival and escaped with its life.\nReading and mud. Inextricably\nlinked, inseparable, insufferable.\nSod it, at least the backstage toilets\nare clean. Felix perks, you see,\neven up to being provided with TV screens showing all the on stage\naction. Mud free viewing.\nBut for some bands you just have\nto be there. Know what I'm saying?\nUnfortunately, or perhaps\nfortunately, on that first Friday\nnight, in a line- up strewn with\ncancellations (Curve, Hiphoprisy,\netc.) the bands on that 'got- to-be'\nlist consist of The Wonder Stuff.\nSod the rest, if we can't have the\nbest, the Stuffies will have to do.\nAnd, for most of their set, they\nwere, for me, the best band of the\nday (Oh, wait, that's not saying\nmuch, is it?). But, and here's the\nthing, but they then brought on Vic\n'n' Bob. Take note, dear Freshers,\nthese people are NOT funny. Also\ntake note that the word 'Not' is\nplaced in the middle of the sentence.\nPlacing it at the end is humour free, and I 'll deck the first person who\ndoes otherwise. Anyway, back to\nthe rather negligible plot; Vic can't sing, and the only salvation is for\nmost of this drivel (which shall\nremain nameless. You can probably\nguess) is that he doesn't. However,\nonce he returns, hopefully to the\ndeep pit from whence he came, we\ncan carry on. The Wonder Stuff are\nokay. At least it's not raining.\nResolving to see more bands, say\ntwo, and with the added bonus of\nsunshine, of sorts, somewhat\nsubduing the all pervasive mud,\nnoon on Saturday introduces a brand new day with Therapy?\n(Remember the question mark,\nalways the question mark) on the\nmain stage. And what an\nappropriate name it is. Anti-mud,\nanti-rain therapy. Wake up, time to\ndie, the sound of the moment is\nfuck pop. Anti-hunger they're not,\nhowever, and sighting a Readingburger stall, I returned to\nthe tent.\nBack in time for Thousand Yard\nStare, however. Now I 've seen\nThousand Yard Stare before, but\nnever have they sounded so crisp,\nand their songs so clear. Clean cut\nand sharp, a real success.\nFamous name Japanese not\ninclude Hirohito? Why, Shonen\nKnife, of course, cute (and they are\never so cute, in their matching heart\ndresses), cult, punk pop band, bring\na little light relief to the tent. (For\nthe uninitiated, the bands at Reading\nappear on two stages; the open air\nmain stage, where it is wet, windy,\nand muddy, and inside a small\nmarquee, where it is wet, windy\nand muddy.)\nSuddenly I'm drowning, not in\nwater, not even in mud, but in\npop kids. Muddy pop kids, but\npop kids all the same. And why?\nVic Reeves: 'Funny' man.\nAbnormal service will be resumed\nnext week.\nScorpio Rising, whatever.\nBecause the pop kids know what the\nSeattle sound alikes don't, they\nknow that EMF stand for Even\nMore Fun.\nBack in shelter city, and\nSunscreem are playing. So what.\nEveryone is waiting, anxiously,\navidly for Suede. Precious,\nprecocious, how could they fail?\nWith all the emotion, the\nexpectation invested in them, how\ncan they succeed? They don't, of\ncourse. Suede, with the weight of\nthe next big thing firmly balanced\non their shoulders, their heads in the\nclouds, their feet in the mud,\nthey're tortured, their twisted set is\ntorn apart. And they're still the only\nband who moved me, emotionally,\nall weekend.\nSunday morning at five o 'clock as\nthe day begins. Inch deep in water,\nit rained through the night. Mud to\nmy ears, and my fire just won't light. Pissed on, pissed off. Let's get pissed.\nVariety is the spice of life. Not\ntoday. The comedy tent has blown\naway. The session tent is closed to\nallow work to stop the same\nhappening there. So we're left with\nNirvanesque noise nik s than\nWashington State. Nevermind, at\nleast, sandwiched in the middle,\nlike a( fake) diamond in the sand,\nare Bjorn Again. For the unaware,\nBjorn Again are Abba, in all their\ngrandeur. Dancing in the slime,\nsing along a bjorn. This is what it's all\nabout. Fun (and I thought they'd banned the f word).\nScorpio Rising, usually a frenetic\nmenage a trois with heaven and\nhell, suffer from having their sound\nblown all around, as the newly\nreopened tent claims another\nvictim. Can anyone British tame the\ntent monster? Eat are on stage. The swamp\nsound, in full effect, in a swamp\nenvironment, sharp yet sticky, and\nwith 'Tombstone' finally burying\nthe festival, for myself at least. Sod\nNirvana, Eat are nirvana, I'm wet,\nmy sleeping bag's wet, my tent's wet, I'm out of here.\nPoddy.\n9Bjorn Again play the UL U all-night er on 16th October. Suede play\nSW1 Club on 19th October. Eat and\nScorpio Rising support PWEI\ntomorrow at the Brixton Academy.\nPage 13\n\n"

Collinge,\nis the sum that was promised by the\nBarclay Foundation in January to\nsave Alzheimer research at St.\nMary's. The research was\nthreatened earlier this year by the\ndeparture of Dr John Hardy's team\nAlumni fund\nto the United States. In widely\nreported comments, Dr Hardy's team said that they were leaving\nBritain as research scientists were\nnot properly valued in this country.\nIn other developments, the Cystic\nFibrosis Trust has donated\n\u00a31,000,000 to cystic fibrosis gene\ntherapy research.\nThe Royal Association for\nDisability and Rehabilitation\n(RADAR) is asking the public to\ndonate their telephone coin box change to charity. RADAR says\nthat up until this week, members of\nthe public had no choice other than\nto lose any unused money retained\nby the coin box. They are now\nasking coin box users to press the\n'follow on' call button after their\ncall, and dial 0891 444 555.\nRetained coins will be donated to\nRADAR.\nAssertiveness\nThe College Development office\nare about to embark on phase 2 of\ntheir 1992 Annual Fund, and are\nlooking for students to work on\ntheir 'telethon' campaign. Students\nwill be paid at least \u00a34 per hour to\nsolicit contributions by telephone\nfrom 500 college Alumni. The\nfund, which has already raised\n\u00a368,000, is hoping to raise a total\nof \u00a3100,000. Students will be asked\nto work 13 hours per week,\nincluding one weekend shift, and\nwill have to undergo a selection test\nand two training sessions before\nthey begin. All enquiries to the\nDevelopment Office, room 3.01a in\nthe Sherfield Building.\nWould you like to polish up your\ncommunication skills? Imperial\nCollege Health Centre is holding an\n8 week Assertiveness Training\nCourse on Wednesday afternoons\nfrom 2pm to 5.15pm. The course,\n'designed to help you know yourself\nbetter', starts on October 14th. Further details from the Health\nCentre, 14 Prince's Gardens.\nMasters update\nThe Stuart Masters Trust is\nmoving closer to its target figure of\n\u00a3380,000. The money is required\nto send three year old Stuart to\nPittsburgh for a life saving liver and\nbowel transplant. Local fundraising\nis being organised by Tony Etienne\nof Imperial's biochemistry\ndepartment. Mr Etienne has so far\nraised \u00a31,600, and says that the\nfund is now just \u00a390,000 short of\nthe target. Appealing for donations\nat Imperial, he told Felix, 'every\nlittle bit helps'.\nCouncil tax\nThe Government has announced\nspecial student arrangements for the\nCouncil Tax, which replaces the\nPoll Tax in April 1993. Under the\narrangements, a house occupied\nsolely by students will be exempt\nfrom the tax. This includes halls of\nresidence, student hostels and\nprivate flats and houses where all\nthe occupants are students.\nThe council tax is set by local\nauthorities to pay for local services,\nand there is one bill per house. The\ntax is based on eight 'valuation\nbands', and assumes that two\ncouncil tax payers occupy each\nhouse. Students will not be counted\nas council tax payers.\nIf two adults live in a house, and\none is a student, the tax bill will be\nreduced by 25%. A student is\ndefined under the legislation as\nsomeone attending a course lasting\nat least one year, and involving 21\nhours of study a week for 24 weeks\neach year. Students on industrial\nplacement as part of their course are\nalso exempt from the tax.\nA new leaflet explaining the tax\nhas been issued by the Department\nof the Environment. The leaflet\nstates that until the introduction of\nthe Council Tax in April 1993, the\npoll tax must still be paid by\nCommunity Charge payers.\nMinisterial announcement confuses issue\nby Declan Curry\nThere has been a muted response\nto the much flagged Government\nannouncement on voluntary\nmembership for student unions.\nJohn Patten, the Secretary of State\nfor Education, told this week's Conservative Party Conference that\n'the NUS (National Union of\nStudents) closed shop must go, and\nsoon.'\nThe announcement follows\nseveral months of unofficial\nministerial consultation on student\nunion membership. At present, all\nmembers of a college or university\nare automatically members of the\ncampus student union. If the\ncampus union decides to join the\nNUS, then all campus union\nmembers are also NUS members.\nUnder voluntary membership for\ncampus unions, students would\ndecide either to leave or join the\ncampus union, and automatically\nthe NUS, if affiliated.\nMr Patten was speaking at the\nConservative Conference debate on\neducation. During the debate, there\nwere calls for the full introduction\nof voluntary membership for all\nunions. In recent weeks,\nConservative Students had\nincreasingly demanded root and\nbranch reform of union\nmembership. Last weekend, several\nnational press journalists were told\nthat a radical shake up would be\nannounced by Mr Patten.\nThe Secretary of State told the\ndelegates that it had always been an\naim of the Conservative Party to\n'preserve and extend personal\nliberty and freedom of choice'. He\naccepted that in a free country, it\nwas the privilege of students to be\nactive in the NUS, though he asked\nwhy the taxpayer should pay for\n'the few who get involved in\nsupporting dubious causes of no\ninterest to ' other students'. The\nEducation Secretary then\nannounced that he would 'bring\nforward proposals to establish the\nvoluntary principle as the basis for\nstudent union membership.'\nDuring his speech, Mr Patten did\nnot detail how he would establish\nthe voluntary principle, nor did he\nindicate when he would bring\nforward his proposals. Speaking to\nthe BBC after his speech, he said\nthat he would announce further\ndetails around Christmas. A spokeswoman for the Department\nfor Education said that there would\nbe a 'small pause' between the end\nof consultations and further\nGovernment action.\nThe Education Secretary's announcement is similar to other\nstatements of intent made by\nprevious Education Secretaries. In\nall previous cases, the ministers\nconcerned encountered fatal\ndifficulties in trying to frame the\nnecessary legislation. Weekend\nnewspaper reports said that Mr\nPatten had 'cleared the hurdles' on\nrestricting the activities of the NUS.\nNo indication was given of this in\nMr Patten's speech to the\nconference.\nThe Education Secretary's comments were dismissed by the\nNUS. which said that there was\nnothing new in the speech. Lorna\nFitzsimons, the NUS president, said\nthat 'it has always been our aim as\na confederation of student unions to\npreserve and extend choice and\nfreedom of expression', adding that\n'the NUS maintains that the\nvoluntary membership principle\nalready exists.'\nEarlier in the week, Ms\nFitzsimons claimed that the NUS\nhad become more Thatcherite in\noutlook. Speaking on STOIC,\nImperial's student television, she\nsaid that student unions providing\ncommercial services were an\nexample of free enterprise and\nentrepreneurship. Senior NUS\nfigures are privately, suggesting that\nthe junior education minister, Nigel\nForman, promised to put the\nvoluntary membership issue 'on the\nlong finger' by greatly extending\nthe consultation period. They\nfurther imply that Mr Forman\nfavours the retention of compulsory\nmembership for campus student\nunions. Speaking in the House of\nCommons in June, Mr Forman said\nthat 'the principle of freedom of\nassociation would suggest that\nstudents should have' the right to\njoin together to form an\norganisation to undertake functions\nto meet their legitimate needs'.\nFELiX\nFelix is produced for and on behalf of Imperial\nPrint Unit.

The call\nwas issued in a bid to further\ndecrease the level of 'walk in' crime\nat Imperial, and made in the week\nwhen it was revealed that over\n2,000 new identity 'swipe cards' were issued at the start of term.\nSenior security officials are\nclaiming that the level of\n'spectacular' crime at the college\nhas decreased markedly since the\nintroduction of the new electronic\nidentification 'swipe card' system\nlast Easter. The new system does\nnot appear to have made any impact\non the level of thefts from unlocked\nor unoccupied offices. Security\nchiefs are saying that the level of\n'walk in - walk off crime would\nslow if the swipe cards were worn\nat all times, as they say this would\nhelp in the detection of strangers.\nFive thefts occurred last Monday,\nthe first day of term. The items\nstolen were a cheque book, a cycle\nsaddle, a purse and two wallets.\nKensington police are still\nquestioning a man detained after\nbeing found in possession of cheque\nbooks and cards stolen from the\ncollege in September. College staff\nand students are being advised to\ntelephone the Sherfield security\nlodge on internal 3372 if their\nswipe cards are lost, or if they see\nanything suspicious.\nAlso this week, the new College\nFire Officer appealed for students\nto exercise restraint when\nconsidering tampering with fire\nfighting apparatus in Halls of\nResidence. Graham Cox said that\nthe equipment was to 'protect and\nsave lives in an emergency', and\nthat tampering could 'turn an\nemergency into a casualty'. Work\nis continuing on the modernisation\nof the college fire systems. Mr Cox\nsaid that some of the current\nsystems were of 'considerable age',\nand that they were being\nprogressively upgraded to meet and\nexceed new safety standards.\n7\nHomeless\nProblem\n8 / 9\nTelephone\nNumbers\n1 1 / 1 2 / 1 3\nReviews\nRound-up\n1 4 / 1 5\nWhat's On\nAround London\n\n"

    "content": "Editorial\nIfyou want to get\ninvolved in Felix,\nthe office is open\nmost days of the\nweek, so come in\nand have a look\nround.\nNews Meetings,\nMonday l pm Reviews Meetings\non Wednesday\nAfternoon\nFeatures should\nbe in friday\nbefore\npublication\nI hope that as many people as\npossible got to read or see a copy\nof Felix in their first week here. I hope to explain here some of the\nreasons behind the way Felix does\nthings\nFinancially we are not\nindependent from Imperial College\nor its Student Union. You, the\nstudent pays money to the College,\nwho then give the Union money,\npart of which funds the production\nof Felix. Because, we are a fairly\nlarge operation we have to add to\nthis money by advertising revenue.\nWe are very lucky, many other\nstudent newspapers have to fund\ntheir entire production with\nadvertising, we do not, because of\nthe Union contributions.\nAnother tradition is that Felix is\neditorially independent of the\nUnion. This makes any comment\nwe make untainted, or san it is ed to\nensure the Union or College gets the\nbest publicity. As soon as one\nperson starts to dictate what Felix\ndoes, in any small way, that\nintegrity is fatally compromised.\nIt is hardly surprising that there\nare times when the Union wants to\ncontrol what Felix does. At the\nmoment, we are being dictated to\nabout how we should run\nadvertising, a major source of the\nmoney that keeps Felix afloat.\nMandy Hurford, the Union\nFelix 943\nManager, is upset about a leaflet\nthat was delivered to all the Halls\nas part of Felix last Saturday. On\nthe leaflet was a plug for an event\nthis week, which is sponsored by\nthe bookstore, Dillons. The leaflet\nwas delivered free, in return for\nentrance to the event by one of our\nphotographers. Mandy believes that\nthis tiny plug for Dillons will drag\nbusiness away from the Imperial\nCollege Union Bookstore.\nAny student knows that the ICU\nBookstore is cheaper and more\nconvenient than any Dillons store\nand stocks texts that are relevant to\nImperial College students and staff.\nAnyone in their right mind would\nbe educationally challenged to\nchoose anywhere else. But if\nImperial College Union Bookstore\nwant to become a going financial\nconcern it must learn to compete in\nthe same market place as other\nchain book stores. Placing of\nadvertising is part of that market\nplace.\nWhat I object to is the Union\nthinking that they can run Felix's advertising. If any bookstore wants\nto give Felix money for advertising\nI will not complain. We run\nadvertising for restaurants, is this\nnot in competition with the Union\nsnack bar? No one voiced a complaint about last weeks\nWagamama competition. The\nOpinion\n9th October 1992\nCollege Bar and QT have also\nadvertised, not a peep was heard out\nof the Union then. Should we\nconsult with the Union about every\npotentially controversial advertising\noffer? Never, besides being\nimpossible to manage, were would\nit end? Soon we would be run lock,\nstock and barrel by the Union. Most\nof all, when the Union makes\ndecisions that affect Felix we are\nrarely consulted, why should we\nconsult them about how to do our\njob?\nCredits\nNews, Sarah, Kevin, Richard,\nDeclan\nReviews, Catherine, Mario,\nSam, Sarah A., Poddy, Gareth\nFeatures, Beccy, Nick Allen,\nKevin\nWhat's On, Boris and James\nPhotos, Simon 1 and Simon 2,\nJoe\nCrossword, John\nUnion, Chris, Rick and Dom,\nAndy Kerr, and everyone else\nthat's had a hard week\nSpecial Thanks, Poddy, Simon,\nCatherine and Sam for the\nFreshers' Fair, Sarah, Chris\nStapleton, Jeremy, James,\nDavid HB, The Spooner,\nAndy, Rose, Sinead, Gwen,\nAnybody else who came in to\nlook around.\nSTUDENT INDUSTRIAL SOCIETY\nGet a mouthful of us at our\nFREE FRESHERS' BUFFET\nFreebies \u2014pens, pencils, balloons,\nt shirts (limited edition)...\n\u2014 Champagne Prize Draw donated by Thresher\nThe largest ever London to Paris hitch\nand exciting, enthralling events too!\nTUESDAY 13th OCTOBER\n1.00pm onwards\nUNION CONCERT HALL (Top Floor)\nJoin the largest independently run national student organisation\nand enjoy the free food and drink\nMembership \u00a33.00 a year (discounts for two or more years)\nPage 3\n\n"

Still rare\nsights in London, but becoming\nincreasingly common as experts\nwarn that the city is coming\nperilously close to emulating New\nYork or Rio de Janeiro in their out-of-control homeless problems.\nWhile the exact number of\nhomeless people on the streets of\nLondon is hard to pin down,\nhomeless organisations put it at the\ntens of thousands and growing, with\nover two million homeless in the\nwhole of England. Despite this,\nthose who work at putting homeless\npeople back into the main stream of\nsociety say that society itself is\nturning a blind eye to the problem.\nT think one of the most\nfrightening things is that we're like\nNew York in the sense that you\nwalk over homeless people, that\nyou push them out of the way to\nwherever you're going,' says Daly\nMaxwell, senior social worker at St\nBotolph's Day Centre in Aldgate.\n'People are begging on the streets\nand I don't think we're really\nprepared to tackle that.'\nFor the past thirty years, St\nBotolph's Day Centre has been\ninvolved in getting the homeless off\nthe streets, giving them a place\nwhere they can get a warm meal\nand a hot shower. During the\ndecade that Maxwell has worked\nwith the centre, he says that there\nhas been the emergence of a new\ntype of homeless. Where once the\ncentre saw mostly the old\n'gentleman tramp' come through its\ndoors, people from a myriad of\nbackgrounds now come to the\ncentre for help.\n'The old-fashioned homeless\nperson has disappeared in the sense\nof the bushy beard, the overcoat and\nthe bottle of bass,' said Maxwell,\nwhose centre handles over three\nhundred people a day. 'They've all\ndied, or ninety nine percent of them\nhave died. Today in Britain you're\nfaced with people who are isolated,\npeople who are without any work,\nmoney or housing. They're the\nhomeless of today in Britain.'\nWith the recession and the restructuring of the British economy\nduring the last ten years, many of\nthe blue-collar jobs that once kept\na person off the streets are no longer\nthere. In addition, Maxwell accused\nfinancially strapped institutions\nthroughout the country of\n'dumping' patients in the real world\nwith little or no preparation.\nBecause of the heterogeneous ness of such a group, which also includes\nthe fifty thousand or so young\npeople who come to London and\nwind up homeless, getting each\nperson off the streets is a case by\ncase basis. Getting someone back\ninto society is more expensive and\ntime-consuming than just providing\nthem with a bed and a meal, but\nMaxwell thinks that it's worth it in\nthe long run: 'It costs a lot of money\nto care for people on an individual\nbasis but I think it's actually in\nBritain's best interests to do so.'\nDuring the last year, the centre has\nhelped about sixty people into new\nhomes and new jobs.\nBut once a person returns to a normal life, there is still a period\nof re- adjustment which can throw\neven the most determined of\nindividuals. Everyday skills like\ncooking meals and going shopping,\nwhich most people take for granted,\nsometimes have to be learned all\nover again.\n'My first eight weeks off the\nstreets were a nightmare,' says\nRobert Winter, a Big Issue editor\nwho had himself been homeless. T spent two years out of doors and\nthen suddenly there was a ceiling\nover me. I got claustrophobia and\nit seemed like the bed was too soft.'\nEven talking politely with people,\nsaid Winter, was a skill he had to\nlearn all over again. Once he had\nwoken up from whatever hole he\nhad chosen to spend the night, he\ncould spend his day by going from\nday centre to day centre, finding\nshelter from the elements and\ngetting food to eat.\n'People may think it's easy being\nhomeless,' said Winter. 'But you're\nactually out walking on the streets\nall day, going from place to place.'\nLike many other homeless people\nhe knows, Winter said he thought\nhe'd be off the streets fairly soon\nafter he lost his job. However, after\nbeing exposed each day to the harsh\nweather and the contempt of his\nfellow man, he grew discouraged\nand saw his expected few weeks\nstretch into months.\n'The homeless lose their jobs and\nOne of London's homeless\nsay quite arrogantly, 'Oh, I 'll get\nanother job in a week',' said\nWinter. T know. It happened to\nme... But then you run out of\nmoney and where you're staying\nsays 'Ok, where's my money?'.'\n'A lot of people who end up\nhomeless like this often become\npermanently trauma tis ed. You\nmight have gone from living with\nyour mother one day, in a nice cosy\napartment, to ending up sleeping\ndown by Embankment,' said\nMaxwell. 'Now, that is one hell of\na shock to the system.'\nBoth Maxwell and Winter say\nthat there is currently too much\nemphasis on short-term solutions,\nsuch as hostels, to take care of the\nproblem. Even where there are\nlong-term programs in place,\nWinter added, too many different\nagencies providing the same\nservices lead to redundancies.\n'They have pilot schemes which\nlook very nice,' said Winter. 'One\nor two councils have their act\ntogether, but nationwide, they've\nfailed.'\nOne program in London which is\nhelping to get homeless people off\nthe street is the very paper that\nWinter works for:Tfie Big Issue. It\nattracts media attention from around\nthe world as a quality newspaper\nsold by homeless people. The Big\nIssue recently celebrated its first\nbirthday and now commands a circulation of one hundred thousand\ncopies for each fortnightly issue.\nIn addition to allowing their\nvendors to earn thirty pence for the\nsale of each edition, the newspaper\nalso offers a number of programs\nre-training people for new jobs.\nBut though Maxwell and Winter\nadmit that they sometimes get\ndiscouraged by the dim prospect of\nthe homeless problem going away,\nthey say that they never let it get\nthem down.\n'There's a lot of people I cannot\nhelp,' said Maxwell. 'That's very\nfrustrating. But the bottom line is\nthat you have to keep going and\nkeep somehow working towards\njustice.'\nPage 7\n\n"
