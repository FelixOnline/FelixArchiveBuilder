    "content": "Let\u2019s Start Here. is a good place to start\nRelationships won the NME and to me, it was like my\nhome football team losing the league, except if they\nplayed every 6 years. I mean everyone hates Spurs, but I\ndon\u2019t actually know, I don\u2019t do football.\nMy point is, I am now better than the haters and mature enough to think that pink is a manly colour, Guinness is the best beer in the world and The 1975 is my\nnew favourite band.\nThe only thing is that the Arctic Monkey\u2019s new album\u201cTheCar\u201dwontheNMEalbumoftheyearaward.\nSad.\nA definitive guide on how to listen to Lil Yachty\u2019s new album.\nMatija Conic Music Writer\nHip hop artists pursuing different genre directions\ndo not always deliver, especially when it comes\nto rock excursions, with instances like Kid Cudi, Logic and MGK coming to mind as horrendous examples.\nThese ventures often come from a rapper\u2019s desire for\ntheir art to be \u201ctaken more seriously\u201d, as Lil Yachty put\nit in his recent listening party for his new project, Let\u2019s\nStart Here. A lot of reception to Quadeca\u2019s last record,\nwhich is a heart-shattering, mind-blowing masterpiece,\nwas similar, praising it for pursuing a more indie direc-tion, framing the approach as artistically superior. This\nsentiment rubs me the wrong way, as it shows that a lot\nof people remain dismissive of hip hop as an artform.\nIt takes a lot more to impress me than a simple genre\ndiversion. If Yachty made a trap record that was great, I\nwould be applauding that achievement as much as I\u2019m\nloving the moodier, psych rock vibes permeating the\ntracklist of Let\u2019s Start Here.\nThat being said, what Yachty has done here makes\nme start to take him more seriously. For one, he utilised\nhis resources extremely well, having enough of an open\nmind to collaborate with people more experienced\nthan him while still maintaining a significant level\nof executive input to keep the project his own. One\nparticularly frustrating thing about rich and influential\nartists like Drake is their reluctance to establish good\ncollaborations and dishing out piles of crap like\nHonestly, Nevermind \u2013 a record born out of this sort\nof arrogance, showing Drake as impressively unaware of\nany forms within the house genre. Yachty, however, did\nhis homework here, kicking the year off with an album\nthat, though by no means perfect or super left field, is a\nwholly enjoyable listening experience. The opener, \u2018the\nBLACK seminole.\u2019, is a truly grandiose track with an\nimpressive climax. I wasn\u2019t as mind-blown by this song\nas many fans were, but it excited me about the places\nin the record Yachty was going to take me deeper into.\nAs for many others, my main qualms regarding tracks\nlike \u2018the BLACK seminole.\u2019 are Yachty\u2019s vocals, with the\nautotune and the heavy processing sometimes doing\nhim a disfavour and coming across as a bit jarring.\nThis issue is most glaring on the track \u2018pRETTy\u2019,\nwhich is a thoroughly painful listen, be it because of\nthe vocal editing or the annoying lyrical content. The\ntrack\u2019s opening line is \u201ccome bust this pussy open\u201d,\nimmediately followed by Yachty\u2019s autotuned moaning\nand bars about grabbing tits \u2013 truly zero things going\nfor this track, absolute lowlight.\nNonetheless, I\u2019m reluctant to claim that his vocals are\nbad by any conventional metric and I really think it\u2019s a\nmatter of personal taste, as it\u2019s clear that Yachty doesn\u2019t\ntake himself as some singer extraordinaire. Sometimes\nthevocalscomplementthevibeofthemelodyfairlywell\ntoo, like on the track \u2018sAy sOMETHINg\u2019 \u2013 a laid-back,\ndreamy ballad that engulfs you in its pretty atmosphere,\nwith tastefully incorporated keys and Yachty\u2019s yelpy\nsinging sounding confident as ever. This is also the case\non \u2018WE SAW THE SUN!\u2019 \u2013 a lovely cut where Yachty\nreally shines through and the autotune feels weirdly\nsoothing and appropriate.\nThe features on this record are fantastic as well, with\nDianaGordonsmashingitonthefrontendof\u2018driveME\ncrazy!\u2019, a low key, disco-adjacent banger. Nothing super\nnew or inventive, but very pleasant on the ears, with\nYachty finishing off the song with some slower verses, a\npace I think is very much his strong suit. Another great\nfeatureisNickHakimon\u2018REACHTHE SUNSHINE\u2019,\none of my top moments, which sees him kicking the\ntrack off with this almost sedated tone sung over a\nminimal, but nonetheless quite tense instrumental.\nThe creepy guitars and eerie synths maintain this\ntension very well, keeping the listener attentive. The\nsong then explodes into these space-filling, expansive\nsynth lines with spooky laughter samples. All these\nelements just come together so neatly. The way Yachty\nenters the track by finishing Hakim\u2019s verse was a detail I\nparticularly enjoyed, with the string sections at the back\nend making for a fantastic way to finish things off.\n\u2018Ride\u2019, on the other hand, while having certain\nenjoyable elements, features Teezo Touchdown, whose\nsinging really takes me out of the vibe for\nreasons I\u2019m not sure I can pinpoint. The keys\nand the melody are great, however, and it\u2019s\ndefinitely a moment that deserves its place in\nthe tracklist. The follow up track, \u2018running\nout of time\u2019 is the most brilliant and effective\ncut on the record in my view. The signature\ndream pop synth lines provided by Magdalena\nBay \u2013 a duo I absolutely adore \u2013 are amazingly\nexecuted and run over easily the smoothest\nbaseline on the album. The track truly makes\nme feel like I\u2019m on top of the world and fills\nme with this optimistic, confident sensation,\nwhile doing comparatively little on the\nproduction front as opposed to many other\nmoments. And this \u2013 this ability to generate a\nbeautifully captivating and laid-back energy with such a\nminimal approach \u2013 is precisely its charm, an approach\nI wish there was more of on the album.\nStanding on the opposite side of the production\nisle is \u2018I\u2019VE OFFICIALLY LOST ViSiON!!!!\u2019 which\ndoes a lot. And by a lot, I mean a lot. It\u2019s an insane,\nindecisive cut, chaotically shifting through different\nlandscapes of sound, but doing so in the best way\npossible. The employment of dark, murky guitars and\nhard-hitting drums that boil your blood, interspersed\nwith contrasting and low key moments where Diana\nGordon sings over some gentle piano keys, makes this\ntrack the most experimental out of the bunch.\nThe middle portion of the record unfortunately\nremains quite forgettable, however, with \u2018(failure(:\u2019,\n\u2018THE zone~\u2019, \u2018paint THE sky\u2019 and \u2018sHouLd i B?\u2019 being\njustokay\u2013reallynothingascaptivatingasthehighlights\nI numbered. Overall though, we have to give credit\nwhere credit is due. Who would have thought Yachty\nwould be as present as he is on my Spotify rotation in\n2023? To all the pretentious music enjoyers who are\ncurrently rubbing their noses and going \u201cAkcHUally,\nthe album sucks, is derivative and not experimental\nenough\u201d and endlessly posting their different, super\nunique opinions online, I don\u2019t care, nobody cares, stop.\nI love that he\u2019s trying new stuff and I very much applaud\nthis (hopefully) defining moment in his discography.\nWith a bit more experience in such genre lanes, I\u2019m\nsure Yachty can take us to some exciting places going\nforward that will stop people from making constant\nTame Impala comparisons and allow him to craft his\nown, recognisable sound.\n38 music.felix@imperial.ac.uk felixonline.co.uk\nKEEP THE CAT FREE\nMUSIC\n\n"

    "content": "Ispent the first week of my supposed winter \u2018break\u2019\nreading, amongst other things (Susan Sontag\nessays and G.H. Hardy\u2019s Apology of Mathematics),\nNabokov\u2019s most infamous work Lolita. It was\ncertainlysomething.Itwasabook,butinfact,todescribe\nLolita as just a book would be to do it a disservice. It is\na study into power and the abuse of it, narrative power,\nand of the English language, in how the events of the\nbook play out and how they are related and revealed.\nLolita is the perfect modernist text to sink into; it\u2019s not\nas densely clever as James Joyce, nor is the reader\u2019s basic\nunderstanding of the characters obstructed by the lack\nof speech marks in, for example, in Virginia Woolf\u2019s\nworks. What is most striking about Lolita is the\nprotagonist, Humbert Humbert, being a perfect character study of Kierkegaard\u2019s idea of the \u2018aesthete\u2019.\nKiekegaard\u2019s model aesthete can be seen, or\nunderstood, in a few key characteristics: it is the\nbasest form of existence, and is defined by revelry in the\nsensual, egotism, flightiness from boredom, and a\nfatalistic use of irony and scepticism to the end.\nThe aesthete, according to Kierkegaard, is entirely\nself-serving and seeks to escape reality through\nfantasies and idealism. The ego of the aesthete seeks\nto \u2018recreate the world in his own image\u2026\u2019 and to\n\u2018[transform] the boring into the interesting.\u2019\nThis exhibits itself almost perfectly in Humbert, the\nprotagonist of Lolita. Humbert himself is a self-de-scribedaestheteandhislovefornymphetsisderivedfrom\na perverted need to see the pure, un-sexualised form of\nan adolescent girl absorbed into his mind and spat out\nas an object of his desire. Humbert\u2019s desire for Dolores\n(\u2018Lolita\u2019) is actualisation of the impossibility of his\noriginal love, Annabel. To Humbert, the fact that Lolita exists and he can abuse her isn\u2019t his goal in and of\nitself, but rather a way of consummating the love he\ncould only dream of previously. This love of Annabel\nbirths the concept of nymphets; Humbert creates his\nown rules and justifications for committing his perversions that numb the pain of his unrequited love.\nTextually, the world is created in Humbert\u2019s image \u2013 we as the reader only know his thoughts, and\nretellings of the events of the novel through his confes-sional. His memories are coloured by his own feelings,\nand parts of the novel even hint at the unreliability of\nhis recollection. But, more importantly, the language\nused represents everything that Humbert is \u2013 the\nactual novel is a delightfully colourful mass of language\nbeing masterfully used, sometimes to horrific effect.\nSimilarly, the English in the novel never truly reaches\nnative flow. Nabokov, as Humbert, constantly reminds\nus of Humbert\u2019s self-imposed pomposity, and his alien\nnature in America as a landed old-world European.\nUltimately presents him as an intruder in suburbia and\nin the ideal life that Dolores is forced to leave behind,\ndespite Humbert attempting to paint himself as someone who naturally fits in, someone who is adored, per-fect, and above all of the other characters in the nov-el. If the reader gets the impression that Humbert is\nabove it all, that is because Humbert, the aesthete, has\ndeemed himself so.\nIn addition, in a more metatextual way, Americana\nand common American tropes are morphed by Humbert\u2019s aestheticism. Nabokov subverts several events\ninto twisted versions of the tropes common to American literature and Americana in general. Humbert,\nthe voyeuristic lodger in the home of the Hazes, becomes a twisted version of the identikit 1950s suburbia dream. The horrible honeymoon of Humbert and\nDolores a riff on the popularity of cross-country travel \u00e1 la Twain\u2019s Huckleberry Finn and Kerouac\u2019s On the\nRoad, and even the violent, bloody climax is a play on\nthe theme of vengeance in the Wild West, with Humbert armed with a pistol to boot. The novel Lolita itself\nis an extension of Humbert imposing himself and his\nego onto the traditions of American literature, on top\nof Humbert oppressively imposing himself on Lolita.\nNotonlyisHumberttheperfectdescriptionoftheKierkegaardianego,butLolitaasawholeisjustthattoo\u2013an\naesthetic tale about the dangers, or rather the folly,\nof purely aesthetic existence. Kierkegaard would undoubtedly have revelled in the tale of little Dolores\nHaze, but for many readers, including myself, despite the richness of the text I couldn\u2019t help finishing\nLolita and falling into a dolour.\nR.I.P.

    "content": "Religionsandspiritualtraditionshave\nbeen a staple of civilisation from\nthe beginning of time, and they are not\ngoing away no matter how hard some\npeople want them to. A lot of people are\nbrought up religious, and are taught to\nfollow the dogma without questioning\n\u2014 if they just follow the rules, they\u2019ll\nbe fine. Many religions teach valuable\nthings about morality, selflessness,\naltruism, wisdom, showing kindness\nand compassion to others, and setting\naside time to reflect. The act of worship,\nwhether it is done alone or with others,\nis central to the lives of most people.\nUnfortunately, religions do have\nsome bad aspects. Followers can develop\nvery firm beliefs, becoming excessively\nuncompromising. They can begin to\nthink that their religion is the true one,\nthe only correct one, and that other\nreligions are beneath consideration.\nOthers may become suspicious, hateful,\nor hostile towards other religions and\ntheir respective followers. In another\nextreme case, there are plenty of\nindividuals or groups who believe that\nbeing religious is required to be \u201cgood\u201d.\nThis is completely wrong \u2014 it is entirely\npossible to be a good person while being\nnon-religious. Furthermore, there are\nsome religious people who, despite\nclaimingotherwise,performactionsthat\ngoagainstwhatisconsideredtobe\u2018good\u2019.\nIt is important to question authority.\nIt is important to criticise and scrutinise\nany belief or system of beliefs whether\nthey be religious, spiritual, political,\nsocial, economic, environmental, or\notherwise. Each person must judge for\nthemselves if their actions and words\nare suitable ways to interact with the\nworld around them. I am not trying to\ntar everyone with the same brush here\n\u2013 I am emphasising the importance\nof questioning and analysing beliefs\ncarefully, as well was doing your best\nto get along with the people around\nyou, regardless of whether or not\nthey hold the same beliefs as you.\nIt is important that people choose\ntheir religious beliefs \u2013 every person\nshould have the freedom to change\nwhat they believe in for any reason.\nIt is important to have meaning in\nlife, and there certainly is meaning in the\nlives of both religious and non-religious\npeople. Any person, regardless of their\nreligious affiliation, is capable of living\nby good values, morals, and principles \u2013\namong which are kindness, generosity,\naltruism, compassion, love, respect,\ncourage, and humility. People can come\nto have these qualities through different\nways, be it through religion, philosophy,\nnature, science, or introspection.\nEveryone needs meaning, but not\neveryone needs religion to get to this.\nThere may not be a God, or gods. There\nmay not be a higher purpose or a grand\nplan, and that is okay \u2014 you can still live\na meaningful life.

But\nfor nearly sixty seasoned members of the\nImperial College Dance Club (ICDC),\nthis was no real hardship as we were on\nour way to compete in the Birmingham\nFriendly Dance Competition.\nHaving started the season triumphantly at the Bath Friendly two months\nbefore, and with two of the year\u2019s most\nprestigious competitions less than\nfour weeks away, the club was keen to\nsucceed. With many, many hours of\ntraining under our belts and a sense\nof comradery only ICDC knows, we\ncharged into a ballroom-based battle against the likes of Oxford, our\nmain rivals Cambridge, and, of course,\nBirmingham, among others.\nThe morning saw the competitors\ntake on the ballroom dances \u2013 the slow,\nsweeping waltz, the passionate tango,\nthe dizziness-inducing Viennese waltz,\nthe stylish and suave foxtrot, and the\naptly-named quickstep \u2013 and Imperial\nstarted the day strong; Imperial couples\nmade the finals a total of sixteen times.\nWe were especially proud of Keven Du\nand ICDC President Izabela Jaszcz\nwho triumphed in the beginner/novice\nfoxtrot, while George Bull and Alessia\nOliveri who won the intermediate 3-Dance, as well as\nDominic Cronie, Nina\nAnderson, Ben Biggs and\nZo\u00eb McGee who all made\nthree ballroom finals.\nThe afternoon saw us\ntackle the Latin American dances; the six hours\nof dancing we had already\ndone wasn\u2019t going to stop\nus from attacking the\nsharp and powerful Cha\nCha Cha, the Brazilian\ncarnival of the Samba,\nthe romantic rumba, the\nPaso Doble, which mimics a Spanish bullfight,\nand the lightning-fast jive.\nImperial couples made\ntheir respective Latin\nfinals twelve times \u2013\nanother great achieve-ment, with Athos Vacanas and Adela Capilnasiu\ntaking the crown in no less than three\nevents (advanced 3-Dance, open rumba and open Paso Doble), sharing the\nlatter award with Ballroom & Latin\nTeam Captain Kennedy Au and Iris\nRoati\u0219. Au, Roati\u0219 Devon Anthony, and\nKatie Chow all made three Latin finals,\nwhilst Biggs and McGee brought their\ntotal finals tally to four in the Open\nRumba.\nBy the end of the Latin rounds, everyone had been dancing for nearly thirteen hours. However, we were not going\nto put on the breaks as the team match\nround \u2013 which sees four couples compete across four dances (waltz, quick-step, Cha, and jive) as a team, with the\nbest-scoring team being crowned the\nchampions \u2013 was about to begin.\nImperial\u2019s four teams all quickly\nqualified for the top-flight team match\nevent (an impressive feat considering the\nstandard of the competition), and from\nthere we saw tough competition from\nthe Universities of Birmingham, Bristol,\nCambridge, and especially Oxford, who\nall teemed with impressive dancers.\nJust before 10pm, the eight best teams\nfought for the day\u2019s ultimate crown in\nthe team match final. We nervously\nwaited for the recalls, hoping to retain\nour now-legendary dominance during\ncompetition team matches.\nWe need not have been nervous, as\nthreeICDCteamsqualifiedforthefinal,\naffirming that our days of governance of\nthe team match were not yet over. The\natmosphere in the crowd during any\nfinal is electric, but the team match final\nalways creates a bottled-lightning feeling\nthroughout the ballroom, and it really\nhelps the finalist perform at their best.\nSPORT\nEsme Lynch First Team Crew\nSweeping success for Dance Club\nDance Club bring home armfuls of trophies from Birmingham friendly competition.\nAfter a strong start to the season\nwhere they found themselves not at\nthe bottom of the league, the Men\u2019s IVs\ncame into the new year with renewed\nspirits and fresh faces.\nThis would quickly change for Finesmaster Toby (holder of the coveted\nDick of the Day), who, in keeping with\ntradition, managed to stop the ball with\neverything except his stick. This included an enthusiastic tackle using his face;\na strong performance in A&E almost\nrivalled his outstanding stick skills.\nLeon Christie, aka The Unit and\nour most decorated Man of the Match,\ndemonstrated his excellent impersonation of a bulldozer, blitzing through\nalmost the entire UCL team. Our resident rattlers Joe \u2018JBug\u2019 Robertson and\nLars Dautlich continued their mental\nwarfare against the other team, this time\nby using jaffa cakes and a stella can as\nshin pads, improved on only by Lars\u2019\nvivid knee-length neon Grinch shorts.\nDespite a great effort from the boys\nand a convincing lead for the first half\n(dampened only by a comeback from\nUCL in the second half, bringing the\nfinal score to 1-4), our relentless spirit\nand unmatched technical skills were not\nenough to overcome UCL; our well-deserved victory, much like our\nVice-Captain Neil Patel, failing to ma-terialise.\nA brief tube ride later (and a small\ndiversion via Charing Cross Hospital for\nToby), the boys put their bruising loss\nbehind them, got glittered up, and hit\nACC.

The strikes are disruptive to our learning, but that pales\nin comparison to the disruption we\u2019re\nalready facing from staff being overworked and underpaid.\u201d\nThe neglect of staff is apparently mul-ti-faceted, as Natalia cites the \u201cslashing\u201d\nof their pensions and real terms decrease\nin pay, as well as the increase in the number of casualised contracts.\nAlong the picket line, there has been\nmuch talk on the latter, with staff arguing that the short-term contracts and\nuncertainty of renewal has contributed\ntowards the increase in stress and men-tal-health issues within the sector.\nAll this concerns Natalia about the\nfuture of higher education, as she tells\nFelix \u201cThe UCU conducted a survey of\ntheir members last year and 60% of re-Isabella Ward Co-Editor-in-Chief\nImperial students aim to help bring end to disputes by increasing pressure on employers.\nAnger as UCU calls off strikes\nContinued on page 7...\nOn Friday night, the University and\nCollege Union (UCU) paused\nstrike action for two weeks after \u201creal\nprogress\u201d was made in talks with employers over pay, conditions and pen-sions.\nThe decision has provoked anger\namongst its members, who worry that\nalleviating pressure now will result in a\nworse offer as employers try to resolve\nthe dispute.

    "content": "ICL returns to its imperial roots and\nannounces plans to create its own empire\nAuthor: Jor Jor Well\nIn a shocking turn of events, our very own Imperial College\nLondon, one of the most prestigious universities in the world, has\nannounced plans to establish its own empire. The move comes\nafteryearsofdominanceinthefieldofscience,withtheinstitution\nalready boasting several Nobel laureates and groundbreaking\nresearch. However, sources close to the university claim that\nthis isn\u2019t enough for Imperial, who now have their sights set on\nconquering the world.\nMeetingswithPMRishiSunakandBillGatesonWednesday\nproved fruitful and they both pledged considerable funds in\nsupport of Imperial\u2019s student army \u2013 notorious for being the\nmost intelligent, motivated, and caffeinated militia in the world.\nSpeaking to Catnip reporters, a spokesperson for the PM said,\n\u201cWe feel that Imperial College London has the knowledge, the\nresources, and the sheer brainpower to establish its own empire.\nThey\u2019re not content with simply being the best in the world at\nscience, they want to be the best in the world at everything, and\nwe are fully backing this sentiment as part of our Levelling Up\nBritain campaign.\u201d\nPlans for world domination are said to be in early stages,\nbut already rumours are circulating about the empire\u2019s possible\nstructure. It is thought that the university\u2019s various faculties will\nbesplitintoseparateterritories,withtheDepartmentofMedicine\ntaking control of healthcare, the Department of Engineering\ndominating industry, and the Department of Mathematics ruling\nover finance. It is unclear what sector the Business School may\ncontrol, but it is expected that it will certainly be vocal about its\nrole in the empire\u2019s overall success; according to an informant,\nthey\u2019ve already got plans for a new currency system based on\n\u2018vibes\u2019.\n\u201cI\u2019m really looking forward to being part of an empire,\u201d said\none Imperial student, who wished to remain anonymous. \u201cI think\nit will look great on my CV.\u201d\nOf course, not everyone is on board with Imperial\u2019s plans.\nSome students are concerned about the potential for conflict with\nother countries, while others are worried about the empire\u2019s\nimpact on their studies. \u201cI mean, I\u2019m trying to pass my exams\nhere,\u201d said a final-year student, clutching a Redbull, \u201cI don\u2019t have\ntime to conquer the world.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure how I feel about this,\u201d said another, \u201cI\u2019ve heard\nthey\u2019ve assigned my lecturer to run Scotland but I asked him and\nhe hasn\u2019t even tasted Irn-Bru.\u201d\nBut for the most part, the student body seems to be excited\nabout the possibilities.

Exploring\nthe motivation for this project, 17\nresearchers published a series of papers\nin The Astrophysical Journal and The\nAstrophysical Journal Letters, claiming\nthat the astrophysical origin of dark\nenergyisblackholes,reaffirmingtheories\nof the universe outlined by general\nrelativity. The team leveraged data from\nthree astronomical surveys: Widefield Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE),\nSloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), and\nthe Cosmological Evolution Survey\n(COSMOS). Analyses of their results\nwere published across two papers, titled\n\u2018A Preferential Growth Channel for\nSupermassive Black Holes in Elliptical\nGalaxies at z\u22642\u2019 and \u2018Observational\nEvidence for Cosmological Coupling of\nBlack Holes and its Implications for an\nAstrophysical Source of Dark Energy\u2019,\nwhich featured the study\u2019s first author,\nDr Duncan Farrah, a University of\nHawai\u2019iastronomerandformerImperial\nPhD student, and co-author Dr Dave\nClements, reader in astrophysics within\nthe Department of Physics at Imperial.\nWhat is the motivation to\nstudy dark energy?\nThe study revealed, through the\nmeasurements of galaxies, that black\nholes are growing more than expected,\naligning with a phenomenon predicted\nby Einstein\u2019s theory of general relativity,\nfirst postulated in 1916. Motivation to\nexplain this phenomenon was explored\nin 1998 following observations from\nthe Supernova Cosmology Project\nand the High-Z Supernova Search\nTeam, which demonstrated that the\nexpansion of the Universe is accelerating\n\u2013 such that everything in the universe\nis moving away from everything else at\nan increasingly fast rate. This result was\ncounter-intuitive: the pull of gravity\nbetween all objects in the Universe\nshould be slowing the expansion of the\nuniverse down. To account for gravity,\nit was proposed that a dark energy was\nresponsible for pushing things apart\nmore strongly than gravity \u2013 which\nlinked to a concept Einstein referred\nto as the cosmological constant, \u039b. The\nconstant also refers to a kind of energy\nincluded in spacetime, vacuum energy,\nwhich pushes the universe further\napart, thus accelerating its expansion.\nBlack holes: their\nproperties and\nimportance in general\nrelativity\nModelling black holes using Einstein\u2019s\ntheory of general relativity has been\nmet with limited success. Black holes\nare problematic; the point of infinity,\nknown as a singularity, residing at the\ncentre of a black hole results in an\nintense gravitational field from which\nnothing, not even light, can escape.\nResults from this study reveal that\nblack holes gain mass in such a way\nthat is consistent with them containing\nvacuum energy, a fact that would\nremove the need for singularities to\nform in their centre. This is compatible\nwith Einstein\u2019s concept of gravity. The\nteam made a series of observations of\nblack holes in dormant galaxies which\nrevealed that they were seven to 20 times\nmore massive than expected. Dormant\ngalaxies are galaxies which have finished\nforming starts, leaving little material\navailable to accrete and contribute to the\nmass of the black hole. Any additional\ngrowth cannot therefore be explained\nby the accumulation of mass. It is\ninstead claimed that black holes achieve\nthis growth through a phenomenon\ncalled 'cosmological coupling', which\nallows black holes to grow and gain\nmass without consuming gas or stars.\nWhat next?\nResearchers of the cosmological\ncoupling study have probed a radical\nrethink of black holes through their\nobservations of dormant elliptical\ngalaxies. The cosmological coupling\nmodel neatly provides a possible\norigin for dark energy in the universe,\nconcluding that black holes are capable\nof providing enough vacuum energy\nnecessary to account for all of the\ndark energy that is measured in the\nuniverse today. Further observations\nconfirming this phenomenon of\ncosmological coupling will redefine our\nunderstanding of what a black hole is,\none that is compatible with Einstein\u2019s\ntheory of general relativity and capable\nof sourcing dark energy. The question of\nthe nature of dark energy is perhaps the\nmost important, unanswered question\nof modern physics. Scientists acquiring\nthe first observational evidence of dark\nenergy and cosmological coupling is\nan exciting, yet premature, proposed\nsolutiontothisquestion.Moreworkand\nresearch on the long-standing mystery\nof dark energy will continue to expand\nour understanding of the fundamental\nphysics of our universe and will\nhopefully confirm a long sought-after\ncomponentofourmodelsofthecosmos.\nTaylor Pomfret Science Editor\nEdited by: angie lo\ntaylor pomfret\nScience&Technology\nScientists probe first observational evidence\nlinking black holes to dark energy\nRoughly 70% of the universe is made of dark energy, an unknown force that can affect the\nuniverse on the largest of scales. Scientists claim they've found its source through the \u2018cosmological\ncoupling\u2019 of black holes.\nDormant galaxy NGC-0524 imaged by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)\nCredit: Wikimedia Commons\n11\n\n"

    "content": "In 1948, the Supreme Court of the United States\nchanged the fate of Hollywood (and, by extension,\nthe entire English-language film industry). From\nthe silent era onwards, the \u2018Big Five\u2019 film studios\n(and the \u2018Little Three\u2019) were establishing a de facto\noligopoly on film production and distribution; they\nowned the films, the film laboratories, the writers,\nand the majority of movie theatres (which, at the\ntime tended to only have one screen). This, evidently,\ngave them a significant amount of control over what\nshowed, and what didn\u2019t (with a charming preference\nfor films they themselves owned). United States v.\nParamount Pictures, Inc., under the USA\u2019s anti-trust\nlaws, decreed a separation between film distribution\nand exhibition, and outlawed and regulated various\nnefarious practices that the studios used to strongarm\nthe few theatres that they didn\u2019t\nown. The result was a huge\nincrease in the number of\nindependent (of the main\ncompanies) producers, studios and movie theatres.\nItisn\u2019thardtoseetheparallels to the current state of\nthe film industry. In 2021,\nDisney alone owned over\n25% of the market share\nfor film studios in North\nAmerica with Sony following close behind at 23.1%.\nIn Disney\u2019s case, the majority of that revenue came\nfrom Shang-Chi and the Legend of the\nTen Rings, Black Widow, and Eternals. For Sony; Spider-Man:\nNo Way Home and\nVenom: Let There\nBe Carnage.\nThe common\nthread there,\nif you haven\u2019t\nspotted it, is that they are all\nMarvel properties.\nIn fact, the first film on the list that isn\u2019t a continuation or reboot of a pre-existing franchise is Free Guy,\nat 10th\nplace, from 20th Century Studios \u2013 although\nit does contain cameos of lightsabers, Hulk fists, and\nCaptain America, thanks entirely to the fact that 20th\nCentury Studios was acquired by Disney in 2019.\nNote that this isn\u2019t a self-indulgent Marvel-bashing\narticle (although that would still be warranted) \u2013 the\nissue isn\u2019t necessarily with the quality of Marvel films,\nbut with the zeitgeist chokehold they\u2019ve held for over\na decade. The acquisition of Marvel in 2009 allowed\nDisneytomorethandoubleitsmarketshareinthefirst\nfive years and dominate the box office for the whole of\nthe 2010s. They pioneered the concept of the \u2018cinematic universe\u2019, and showed the rest of the industry the\nmoney-making power of pre-existing intellectual prop-erty. Obviously, the MCU wouldn\u2019t have had as much\nstaying power if it hadn\u2019t produced some good films\nto begin with, but Disney quickly realised that\nas long as they had the same narrative link and formula \u2013 be it\nIron Man, Spiderman, or\nt h e illustrious \u2018crossover\u2019\n\u2013 they could pretty\nmuch churn out\nany milquetoast,\nfanservice feat u r e\nand still\nmake the big\nbucks.\nThese franchises became\neven more\nvaluable as the\nage of streaming\nemerged, where\nthe production\nof spin-off shows\ncould drive customers\ntowards the individual streaming\nservices operated by each studio. Streaming also\nprecipitated a huge rise in \u2018consolidation\u2019 of the industry \u2013 the purchasing of legacy studios by the dominating companies. In 2016, AT&T bought Time Warner\n(Warner Bros. and HBO); in 2019, Disney made the\nhugely significant purchase of 20th Century Studios\nfor $71 billion; and recently, in 2022, MGM Studios was bought by Amazon for a paltry $8.45 billion.\nThe effect of these purchases is giving those companies\ncontrol over an entire century of cultural backlog, even\nmore existing popular films and shows (think about\nhow many times you\u2019ve seen the 20th Century production logo at the start of a movie) to entice people\nonto their streaming sites. After Disney\u2019s purchase,\nthey immediately began blocking the licensing of old\n20th Century films to independent theatres \u2013 many of\nwhich rely on archive screenings to stay afloat.\nIt also provides more content for future reboots \u2013 no\none else really had a chance at making Rings of Power\nonce Jeff Bezos set his sights on the Tolkien estate. The\ndeep pockets of Big Tech (Amazon, Apple, Netflix) as\nthey entered into media production also drove up pric-es. All this has the effect of \u2018altering the\ncultural output\u2019, as Paris\nMarx put it\nin his\narticle for Tribune - which\nprojects get greenlit, which films and shows we see\non our favourite streaming sites, is all dictated by the\nboards of a small number of multimedia conglomer-ates. It\u2019s almost uncanny how similar the current situation is to that of the 30s and 40s; a few huge studios\nthat control both production and distribution. Except\nthis time, no one is going to get in their way (and certainly not the US government).\nIn 2020, the Paramount Decrees, as they became\nknown, were terminated \u2013 citing a shift in the media\nlandscape, from movie theatres to streaming, that rendered the clauses obsolete. At this point, it might not\nhave a very big effect on the state of the industry, but it\nisapoignantknellthatheraldsitsdirection;neversend\nto know for whom the bell tolls.\nMonopoly: the movie(s)\nFRIDAY 24TH FEBRUARY 2023\nEdited by: Mike Buzadji\nJonah Hewett\nFilm&TV\nfilm.felix@imperial.ac.uk felixonline.co.uk 39\nJonah Hewett Film Editor\nFilm Editor Jonah Hewett discusses the implications of the money and power behind the film industry.

But for Yian \u2018Zinger\u2019\nZeng it is a prospect that is getting realer by the minute as she counts down to\nStudent Fight Night London.\nOn the 9th\nMarch around 100\nstudents (most of whom have never\nboxed previously) will enter the ring\nin front of a 1000-strong crowd at the\nClapham Grand. The black-tie event\naims to raise funds for testicular cancer\ncharity The OddBalls Foundation.\nFighters are given seven weeks of\nboxing training, with sessions running\nfour times a week. When Imperial Rugby were contacted about the chance to\nfeature in Fight Night, Zinger \u201cgrabbed\nthe opportunity\u201d.\nIt sounds like a gruelling programme,\nso how does she stay motivated? It\u2019s\nsimple: \u201cI don\u2019t want to get clarted.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m enjoying the training,\u201d the young\nfighter tells me, \u201ca lot of it is just: keep\ndrilling the basics because in a fight,\nyou're not going to remember \u2018duck,\nhook, jab\u2019; you\u2019ve just got to remember\nto punch straight and protect your face\nin the fight.\u201d\nThe unforgiving schedule has inevitably made her fitter than ever; \u201cI\u2019m\ncycling to uni so fast,\u201d she brags. Moreover, it\u2019s remoulded the way she views\nexercise and physical fitness. Admitting\nthat she previously prioritised her gym\nroutine around aesthetic goals, Yian tells\nme \u201cI've learned how nice it is to be aer-obically fit\u2026 I can now do more press\nups than I used to and not die as much.\u201d\nA keen member of the Women\u2019s Rugby\nClub, it sounds like she\u2019s running circles\nround the other rugby girls: \u201cTo be that\nfast person, even on a warm up lap, is\nreally nice.\u201d\nShe will, however, have to make sure\nshe looks after herself, citing the thought\nof being injured on the night as one of\nher biggest worries.\nRecently, the training sessions have\nmoved beyond drills and attendees\nhave started sparring. Yian has been\nstruggling with this transition, telling\nme \u201cI hate it.\u201d It seems that the biggest\nchallenge to Yian may not so much be\nthe fitness of her body, but more of her\nmind. The hardest thing she has had to\nlearn so far is \u201ctaking a punch and not\nbeing upset at that person because it\u2019s\nhard going.\u201d In the words of Rocky \u201cIt\nain\u2019t about how hard you're hit, it's about\nhow you can get hit and keep moving\nforward.\u201d\nYet this \u201cmoving forward\u201d isn\u2019t something Yian is used to; she explains \u201cIt\u2019s\nnot like in rugby when you can whistle\nthe ref. My opponent can hit me however she likes.\u201d A skilled basketball and\nnetball player as well, the dramatic\ndifference in discipline struck her, as she\nexplains \u201cI feel like I\u2019m so used to doing\nthings properly. Even if I miss a tackle, I\ntry to do it properly. But now in boxing,\nall bets are off.\u201d\nHaving spent so much time training\nalongside her potential opponents, Yian\nfinds it hard to throw herself into the\nfight. She hopes that this will change as\ntime goes on, explaining \u201cthe more I\u2019ve\nbeen training, the more I really want to\nwin.\u201d However, she\u2019s still not sure that\nshe will be able to fully throw herself\ninto it until the big night: \u201cI\u2019m just hoping the atmosphere will just slap me in\nthe face.\u201d\nInitially, it seemed like she was rather unbothered by the whole idea of\nFight Night. When I ask why she signed\nup, expecting some [insert boxing film\nhere]-style monologue, she rather anti-climatically responds \u201cI thought this\nwould be really funny.\u201d However, with\nless than three weeks to go until the big\nbout, this is beginning to change. \u201cThe\nmore I\u2019ve been doing it, the more I really\nwant to win,\u201d she tells me.\nWhen she explains \u201cI plan to start\ngoing to the gym for strength training\nbecause I don\u2019t punch very hard\u201d, I query\nwhether this is a purely physical issue, or\nlinkedtohermindset.Myquestionmust\nhave thrown her off, and I watch it dawn\non her that perhaps it is time to start\nswinging, \u201cMy big fear is [on the night]\ngetting so scared that I don\u2019t punch,\u201d she\ntells me, \u201cbut I don\u2019t know how to train\nmentally\u201d. She thinks aloud \u201cI\u2019m not\ngoing to start punching people [outside\ntraining]. Maybe I should.\u201d\nAs for what she\u2019s most looking forward to, her eyes light up at \u201cthe idea\nof winning in front of all my friends,\nor even just being cheered on.\u201d This is\nthe first time Yian is competing in an\nindividual sport, and she finds the idea\nof all eyes being on her exciting too. \u201cI\njust want to put on a show and entertain\nmy friends. It\u2019s like the Olympics.\u201d She\nknows that, win or lose, a performance\nshe will put on. Even if she does \u201cget\nclarted\u201d, she still feels fortunate to have\nhad the experience of learning to box.\nYet no matter how glorious the olym-pics-level attention and chance at stardom may be, the idea that it soon will all\nbe over seems to bring relief to the ringster,asshetellsme\u201cIwouldn\u2019tsayIenjoy\nboxing that much. I prefer team sports.\u201d\nWith her heightened physical and mental resilience, she will be a bigger asset to\nher rugby team than ever before.\nUntil the final fight, Yian clearly has\na long way to go. She evidently doubts\nher own ability to throw herself into the\nfight,butishopingthatdoingsowillnot\njust make for an entertaining spectacle\nfor her friends, but strengthen her in the\nlong run. \u201cI really don\u2019t think I have that\nfighter\u2019s instinct in me,\u201d she concedes,\n\u201cI think that\u2019s such an important part\nof boxing and I don\u2019t quite have it. But\nI feel that if I can train and I can do it,\nthen it will be of huge benefit to my self\nconfidence.\u201d\nAs she battles the physical and mental\ndemands of white-collar boxing, she is\ndriven by an inspiring mantra: \u201cIt\u2019s clart\nor get clarted\u201d.\nKEEP THE CAT FREE\n48 sport.felix@imperial.ac.uk felixonline.co.uk\nSPORT & SOCIETIES Edited by: Isabella Ward\nCharlotte Probstel\nNatalie Yu\nSport&Societies\nIsabella Ward Co-Editor-in-Chief\nOne Punch Yian\nWithStudentFightNightLondonfastapproaching,Yian\u2018Zinger\u2019Zenghasmasteredfloatinglikeabutterfly\u2014butcanshebring\nherself to sting like a bee?\nI'M CYCLING TO\nUNI SO FAST.\nCredit: Isaac Winson\n\n"

In 2019, as these students were\nbeginning university, the Department of\nPhysics introduced a new syllabus.\nMany feel that the rollout was conducted without sufficient planning; students described their cohort as guinea\npigs.\u201cItjustdoesn\u2019tfeelliketheythought\nit through at all beforehand \u2014 they just\nthrew it at us and hoped for the best.\u201d\nOne student tells us as a consequence of\nits sheer difficulty, the syllabus had to be\nrevised dramatically for subsequent year\ngroups.\nAn example consistently cited by\nfourth-year students is the \u2018team-based\nproblem solving\u2019 (TBPS) project. First\nintroduced for their cohort in 2021/22,\nTBPS is a 25-person group project, in\nwhich third-year students are asked to\nsolve a data-based physics problem to-gether. Half the cohort completes the\nmodule in Autumn Term, while the other half completes it in Spring Term.\nStudents in the \u2018guinea pig\u2019 year say\nthat they were given very little information on the module until it began, beyond the fact that it was \u201csome sort of\ngroup project\u201d. Unaware of TBPS, many\nhad selected electives in order to spread\ntheir workload across the year. They\nwere therefore caught out when, in the\nfirst week of Autumn Term, they were\ntold it would require a significant time\ncommitment.\nAs the project unfolded, other problems began to emerge. \u201cIt became clear\nthat it [TBPS] had not been formally\nstructured or planned out. The department waited until students got to an\nobstacle, and then released more infor-mation, which made it very difficult to\nplan around.\u201d\nThroughout TBPS, students say they\nwere not given enough support and had\nto figure everything out for themselves.\nThe module leader, they allege, told\nthem they would be \u201cpenalised for asking silly questions\u201d.\nHalfway into the project, students re-alisedtheywereexpectedtousemachine\nlearning (ML) to solve the problem \u2014\ndespite having never been taught ML\nbefore. \u201cIt was luck of the draw whether you had someone in your group who\nknew ML or not\u201d, said a former student\nrep.\nThe anger and hurt is particularly palpable in the voices of those who took\nthe module in Autumn Term. \u201cA lot of\npeople got burnt out from this project,\u201d\nsays one student. \u201cIt made it really, really\ndifficult to get through that first term.\nI developed some pretty serious mental\nhealth conditions during that time as\nwell. In my group, we put a lot of effort\ninto it, but by the end, we just didn\u2019t\nhave anything left to give.\u201d\nIn summary\nThe responses to the TBPS project\nare reflective of a wider feeling amongst\nthe so-called guinea-pig cohort, and be-yond.\nAcross year groups, a sense persists\nthat Imperial\u2019s Department of Physics\ndoes not care for its students. Throughout, what seems to frustrate Physics\nstudents the most is the department\u2019s\ndismissiveness and lack of understand-ing. \u201cWe don\u2019t feel seen or heard by the\ndepartment at all\u201d, said one. Students\ntalk of being \u201cinfantilised\u201d, and \u201cstranded\u201d \u2014 of decisions being made for them,\ninstead of with them. They feel \u201cpowerless\u201d.\nThis was especially the case last year,\nwhen students say they were keen to\nreturn to in-person lectures, but the department opted to keep them online.\nPhysics undergraduates feel that they\nhave tried their best to tell the department what needs improving, and convey their opinions through surveys and\nstudent representatives. Yet they see very\nlittletangiblechange.\u201cIt\u2019sreallyfrustrating. Why are you asking me for my opinion if you\u2019re not going to do anything\naboutitanyway?\u201d,asksarecentgraduate.\nCourse representatives talk of being\nside-lined by the department at meet-ings, and feel that they are not listened\nto. \u201cRather than taking the feedback and\nlooking at the issue, the department explains to everybody, \u2018This is why we\u2019ve\ndone this\u2019, instead of asking, \u2018What can\nwe actually do to fix this?\u2019\u201d\nThe lack of acknowledgement has led\nto disillusionment. Physics undergraduates who spoke to Felix have called the\ndepartment \u201ctwo-faced\u201d, \u201csurvivalist\u201d,\nand \u201cMachiavellian\u201d.\nThere is a sense that things are slowly\n\u2014 at a glacial pace \u2014 improving. Felix\nunderstands that over the summer of\n2022, in response to its low NSS scores,\nthe department commissioned working\ngroups, consisting of students and staff,\nto try to understand the problem.\nIt remains to be seen what impact its\nfuture initiatives will have. But through\ntalking to students, one thing is clear:\nthe department\u2019s past actions have left\nan indelible mark on the lives of many\nof the Physics undergraduates who have\npassed through its doors.\nAlex, the student we spoke to at the\nbeginning of this piece, was part of the\nguinea-pig year. They chose not to stay\non for a master\u2019s degree after their experiences at Imperial\u2019s Department of\nPhysics:\n\u201cWhenever things go wrong, the department just shrugs its shoulders and\nis like, \u2018Oh well, we\u2019ll do it better next\ntime\u2019. And for them, that\u2019s fine because\nthey get to have that learning curve. But\nfor me, this affected my grades, my wellbeing and my whole experience.\u201d\n\u201cI no longer knew why I was doing\nPhysics. The degree had very much taken the fun out of it. I think all of us,\nwhen we started, enjoyed learning, and\nthat was taken away from us. It was just\nabout surviving, not really about thriv-ing, or being excited about the subject.\nI had my first anxiety attack at Imperial,\nand mental breakdowns became a very\nnormal part of my life. I\u2019ve been going\nto therapy for a year now.\u201d\nTheDepartmenthasbeenapproached\nfor comment.\n\u00a9 Anni Fan\nOutside the Physics welfare staff offices.\n\u00a9 Anni Fan\nInside the Blackett Laboratory, home to Imperial\u2019s Department of Physics.\n\n"

So it\u2019s not like\nit\u2019s an us issue. It\u2019s a women\u2019s rugby issue.\u201d\nShe enjoys working with the men\u2019s club and appreciates the support her club receives from them, as the\nmen\u2019s club do the majority of the event organisation. In\nfuture, she hopes to work more across the clubs, saying\n\u201cI\u2019d rather have unity.\u201d\nDespite the still prevalent issues, ICURWFC has a\npositive outlook. Martha tells me \u201cGrassroots women\u2019s\nrugby is really on the rise \u2013 the increase in numbers has\nbeen amazing.

We started\nstrong, with full back Scarlett Yeadon scoring a try in\nthe first ten minutes.\nOur next play was a classic: solid ball carrying from\nthe forwards for a few phases, followed by some exquisite passing from the backs and a break on the wing by\nRuby Haddad. Orla Dusgupta side-steps Herts and\nsecures a beautiful prop try, which is then slotted\nthrough the posts for a\nconversion by Prudence\nLee.\nSolid defence from\nHerts forces us to kick\nthe ball out, but Imperial regain possession after\npressure from our line-out forces an over-throw\nfrom Herts. Our backs\ndo all the work from then\nout to carry the ball from\nthe halfway line, but it\u2019s\nworth it as it leads to\na second try scored by\nScarlett. Helene Biragnet\nkicksusthroughtheposts\nto bring the score to 19-0.\nHerts score their first try on the back of a scrum with\na great break through our line of defence from their\nscrum-half, who also converts the try. After a tiring\nstring of line-outs and scrums where Herts ultimately overpowered us, their scrum-half finished with an\nincredible break on the wing and scored a well-de-served converted try. At half-time the score was 19-14.\nWith the margin of or lead dramatically narrowed,\nwe were under heightened pressure.\nOur defence was stronger coming into the second\nhalf, but ball possession was still quite contested. Alice\nWoodcock jackals the ball in their 22 and Scarlett Yeadon scores once again. Converted by Prudence Lee and\nher reliable kick - the score was now 26-14. But Herts\nwere not letting up and they seized the opportunity to\nscore a try on the right wing to bring the score to 26-19. Try for try continues as IC\u2019s Noor Limmer steals\nthe ball which enables Alice Woodcook to score a clean\ntry. 31-19.\nThe next try came from great support play. Scarlett\nYeadon steps Herts and Noor Limmer is there for the\noffload. Players are there to ruck over when Limmer is\ntackled and Alice scores again with another fabulous\nforwards try.

Next\nto you is a lanky, hoodie-clad figure\nseemingly doing the same, when they\nsuddenly crouch beside a log and pull\nit upward. Pausing for a minute, they\ntake a quick scan, and suddenly reach\nout their hand to grab something.\nJustifiably suspicious, you watch. They\ntake out a camera and a small glass jar,\ndrop something into it, and start clicking like a madman. Suddenly, they tip\nthe jar on its side, and then lie on their\nstomach on the muddy ground for several minutes as they continue taking\nphotos. After a few minutes, the surreal\nscene unfolding before you is over. You\nare thoroughly confused, and you continue on your way, looking at them one\nlast time.\nThe series of events above is far from\nfictitious. Just a few days ago, I was in\nHyde Park, London, searching for various invertebrates, when I happened to\nfind a brown centipede (Lithobius forfi-catus), what is often called Britain\u2019s most\ncommon centipede, but always a delight\ntoseescuttlingforcover.Asisrequiredof\nus log-lifters, I had to match the animal\u2019s\nspeed by grabbing it as fast as possible,\nbefore putting it in a contained environment so I could get some shots.

There\nis the anticipation as you see the object,\napproach it, and pull. In that split-second, you have to process the information that there is something there, and\ncatch hold of it if required, or simply\nrevel in what you have unearthed (pun\nintended).\nI have had my fair share of interesting\nsous-cover finds. The first time I lifted\na log and actually saw something to my\nliking was in Richmond Park, London,\nin September 2022. It was a warm after-noon, and the sun was just beginning to\nshow some desire for the horizon. I was\nalmost robotically turning over some\nlogs when suddenly, as I was just about\nto replace one, I saw a reptilian head\nwrithing underneath. The excitement\nrapidly reached an acme as tiny legs and\na tail surfaced from under the grains of\nsand. I had managed to disturb a Viviparous lizard (Zootoca vivipara) from its\nafternoon siesta. The generally speedy\nlittle reptile took a solid thirty seconds\nto properly awaken and then jolted\naround before disappearing into nearby\nshrubbery. I\u2019ve seen four other lizards\nunderneath rocks, three geckos (only\none of which was slow enough to photo-graph), and one skink, all in Hyderabad.\nMore recently, I had lifted a rock\non Hyderabad\u2019s Kasu Brahmananda\nReddy National Park\u2019s outer jogging\ntrail. A little black centipede lay on the\nsoil,wonderingwhetheritwasworththe\neffort to escape. I took a quick look and\nwas about to place the rock back when\nI noticed what seemed to be a mottled\neight-legged alien pancake beside my\nhand, on the underside of the rock.\nWhat I had found was a massive female\nPantropical Huntsman Spider (Heterop-oda venatoria). As I lay the rock down\nand brought out my clip-on macro\nlens, she remained quite calm for a few\nseconds. Then, in a blinding flash, she\nwas gone \u2014 under the rock, that is. I\nturned it over again, only for her to dart\ntotheotherend.WhenIfinallymanaged\nto flush her onto the main path and get\nsome photos, a considerate dog-walker\nsuggested I put her back into the foliage\non the side so she wouldn\u2019t be attacked\nby pedestrians, bipedal or quadrupedal.\nI have no intention of giving up this\nlittle pastime. It\u2019s a great way to spend a\nsmallpartofmydayconnectingabitwith\nnature while experiencing little bursts of\njoy \u2014 even an hour of disappointment is\ninstantly compensated by a single interesting discovery. It\u2019s also a great workout\n\u2014 the best animals are often to be found\nunder the largest boulders! Even if it\u2019s\njust woodlice and earthworms (some\nof which, mind you, can get almost\nunbelievably large), there\u2019s always a\nliving creature inhabiting the rich ecosystem that is the bottom of a rock.

    "content": "Mustard gas was a compound used\nin World War I as a chemical\nweapon, causing painful internal and\nexternal burns and ending 100,000\nlives. However, inanimate objects are\nnot inherently prejudicial or beneficial\nto humans; it is the usage of them that\nreally matters. In the case of mustard gas,\nthis was proven years after WWI when it\nshifted from ending lives to saving them.\nThe horrors: origins and use\nin war\nMustard gas was created by Frederick\nGuthrie in 1860. With a yellow colour\nand mustard odour, the synthesised\ncompound was toxic to humans in two\nways. First, mustard gas is a blistering\nagent and irritant, affecting the eyes,\nskin, and respiratory system. Second,\nmustard gas can lead to DNA mutations\nby adding unnatural carbon-hydrogen\nmolecules to the nitrogen bases of\nDNA, which causes base mispairing.\nThe effect of mustard gas is dose-dependent, ranging from simple skin\nand eye irritation to an agonising death\nwith blisters all over the body.\nThe employment of mustard gas as a\nchemical weapon started in WWI and\nwas developed by the scientist Fritz\nHaber, who also invented nitrogren\nfertiliser. Mustard gas was very effective\nagainst enemy soldiers that were\nsecluded in trenches, as their small space\nincreased the gas\u2019s lethality. In addition,\nunlikeotherchemicalweapons,theeffect\nof mustard gas could not be countered\nwith gas masks as the gas could be\nabsorbed through the skin. The affected\nsoldiers were in a critical situation as two\noptions were presented to them, both\nequally hopeless: exit the trenches and\nbe an easy target for enemy fire, or stay\nto be poisoned. The suffering caused,\nand the fact that mustard gas does not\ndiscriminate between enemies and allies,\ntriggered the fighting countries to agree\ntoneverusechemicalweapons,including\nmustard gas, ever again in warfare.\nThe redemption:\nchemotherapy\nFrom tragedies, hope can be restored.\nIn 1943, US president Theodore\nRoosevelt sent a ship called SS John\nHarvey to Bari, Italy, with the secret\nmission of delivering 100 tons of\nmustard gas to the Allies. This was\ndue to all the participants of WWII\nhaving chemical weapons stocked in\ncase the other side were to use them.\nUnfortunately, Germany bombarded\nBari, which sank SS John Harvey and\nreleased its lethal cargo into the water\nand air of the city. The entire crew of SS\nJohn Harvey died, so nobody was able\nto inform the citizens of Bari about the\nimpending chemical danger. A few days\nlater,soldiersandcivilianssuccumbedto\nmustard gas intoxication.\nWhen looking through the victims\u2019\nmedical records, doctors Louis\nGoodman and Alfred Gilman noticed\nthat they showed a significant decrease\nin white blood cell counts, presumably\ndue to mustard gas damaging their\nDNA. Goodman and Gilman\nhypothesised that mustard gas could\nbe used to kill cancerous white blood\ncells as well, seeding the idea for a\nnovel chemotherapy for blood cancer.\nA cancer patient known as JD suffered\nfrom advanced lymphosarcoma. He had\na huge tumour in his jaw that did not\nallow him to eat properly and multiple\ntumours in the armpits that disrupted\nhis sleep. Doctors said his future seemed\nhopeless. Without many options, he\ndecided to undergo a clinical trial with\nnitrogen mustard (the substrate to\nsynthesise mustard gas) conducted by\nGoodman and Gilman. Surprisingly, the\ntumours regressed and JD could sleep\nand eat properly again.\nA huge breakthrough occurred in\nthe fight against cancer using the same\ncompoundthatkilledthousands25years\nago. After WWII, chemist Alexander\nHaddow modified the chemical\nstructure of nitrogen mustard to reduce\nits side effects while enhancing its\ntherapeutical properties. This modified\ndrug is called chlorambucil, which was\napproved for medical use in the United\nStates in 1957. Chlorambucil belongs to\na group of drugs called alkylating agents.\nThe drug works by means of sticking\nto one of the cancer cell's two DNA\nstrands. This blocking of the formation\nof DNA prevents the cancer cells from\nseparating\u2013thusslowingorstoppingthe\ngrowth of cancer cells. The medication\nis sold under the name Leukeran, and\nis used to treat certain types of cancer\n(such as chronic lymphtoic leukaemia,\nHodgkin lymphoma, and non-Hodgkin\nlymphoma).\nThe work of Goodman, Gilman,\nand Haddow was instrumental in the\ndevelopment of modern chemotherapy,\nas it showed that toxic compounds can\nbe modified to cure cancer. This fostered\ninvestigation from other scientists across\nthe globe into other chemicals with\ncancer-killingproperties,resultinginthe\nwide variety of chemotherapies available\ntoday.\nThe story of JD did not have a happy\nending. His cancer was too advanced\nto be completely reversed by nitrogen\nmustard and he passed away six months\nafter being treated, but JD\u2019s quality of\nlife improved significantly in his final\nmonths thanks to the treatment. The\ncase of mustard gas shows that even the\nmost sinister chemical can be used for\ngood purposes, we just need to find out\nhow. It is only the selfishness and hate of\nhuman nature that make them become\nweapons of mass destruction.\nThe redemption of mustard gas\nWang Guo Science Writer\nWang Guo on how a weapon of warfare has been harnessed for battling cancer.\nKEEP THE CAT FREE\nSCIENCE\nscience.felix@imperial.ac.uk felixonline.co.uk\n14\nWW2 mustard gas poster.\nCredit: Wikimedia Commons\nCredit: Wikimedia Commons\nBritish physicist, Fredrick Guthrie (1880),\none of the first scientists to document the\ntoxic effects of mustard gas.\nMolecular structure of chlorambucil, a 'nitrogen mustard' synthesised through mustard gas.

For example,\nmany of those who\nare really behind\no n\nlectures\ndon\u2019t actually know\nthat they can get help with\nthat, so they fall even furt h e r behind\u201d.\nThe representative reported these\nproblems to the department, but said\nthe year group organiser\u2019s response \u2014\n\u201cTell person X about it\u201d \u2014 was of no\nhelp. \u201cIf most of the cohort is stressing out, they\u2019re not all just going to go\nto this one person, because clearly the\nproblem is bigger than that. I mean, [the\nyear group organiser] didn\u2019t really take\nany action on that.\u201d\nLeft adrift, students are banding together to offer each other the learning\nsupport they feel they are not receiving.\nThe current first-year cohort has asked\nits representatives to create study groups\nfor them so they can solve more problems together. Most students find that\ntheir best source of help is their cohort\u2019s\ngroup chat, which several said was better\nthan the support provided by lecturers\nand the department. Already, older students run a helpdesk (sponsored by the\ndepartment) where students are encouraged to take queries. One third-year student found this was the \u201cmost helpful\u201d\noutlet she had during her degree.\nWelfare\nWhilst the problems stem\nfrom a high workload,\nthe department\u2019s attitude to well-being,andits\nwelfare pro-vision,\nh a v e\nb e e n\nr o u n d l y\ncriticised.\nThere is a general sense that\nthe department\ndoes not take\nits students\u2019 mental health seriously\nenough.\n\u201cIthinkformanypeople the best representation of how this course\nmakes them feel is the scene\nfrom Indiana Jones, where the\nNazi\u2019s face is melting\u201d, says one\nsecond-year student. \u201cThe department can see how stressed we are,\nbut what do they do?

It was only when she\ngot the Head of Department involved\nthat she received a response.\nWelfare events held by the department have been mentioned by several\nstudents. \u201cInstead of solving the problem at hand, they provide support such\nas tea and biscuits, which just seems\nlike the complete wrong approach and\ndoesn\u2019t actually help\u201d, says one student.\nStudents\u2019 experiences with their personal tutors vary. Some have praised\nthem as \u201cabsolutely amazing,\u201d but others\nfind their tutors apathetic and indiffer-ent.\nOne third-year physicist was scath-ing: \u201cI think my personal tutor doesn\u2019t\nreally care. I tell him the same things\nevery time, and he forgets them between\nmeetings\u2026 he\u2019s not really supportive.\u201d\n\u201cThere are members of the department who are accredited \u2018Mental Health\nFirst Aiders\u2019, who I know people have\ngone to for issues about mental health\u201d,\nsays a former Wellbeing Rep. \u201cThey\u2019ve\nbeen told, \u2018Maybe work harder, so you\ncan take your mind off it\u2019.\u201d\nImperial\u2019s Mental Health First Aid\n(MHFA) course is accredited by MHFA\nEngland.

    "content": "The Imp e r i a l\nCollege Women\u2019s Rugby Club (ICUWRFC) are flying\nhigh. As the season winds down, they remain unde-feated, and will likely be\npromoted for next year.\nThey are now looking\nforward to showing off their\nimpressive gameplay at the\nCity Varsity (TCV), their\nexhibition match against LSE.\nBut it\u2019s not only recently that they have gotten into\ntheir stride \u2013 Imperial College\nwas a founding member of\nthe Women\u2019s Rugby Football\nUnion in 1983. By that point,\nthe Imperial Ladies\u2019 Rugby team was already well sea-soned, having established themself as a competitive\nteam throughout the late 1970s.\nIn1980theteambecameofparticularinterest,when\ntheir game against University College London (played\nat Harlington) was filmed by the BBC for the news\nprogramme Nationwide and the team was featured\nbytheEveningNewsandTheSun.Felixwrotethat\nthe team had even sparked the interest\nof the BBC World Service.\nThe team were also featured, but\nless favourably, in the Daily Express, in\nan article which Felix later apologised\nhad \u201ctrivialised\u201d the team. This is of\nno surprise to ICUWRFC Club Captain Martha, who, 40 years on, still feels that\nwomen\u2019s rugby is not taken seriously. She\ntells Felix \u201cLots of people don\u2019t really think\nit\u2019s a proper sport,\u201d saying there is a tendency to view the team as \u201cchildlike\u201d and that\n\u201cwe get talked down to by coaches, who say\nthingslike\u2018doyouknowtherules?\u2019\u201dIt\u2019schilling to see little has changed since the Daily\nExpress article, which incorrectly writes \u201cthe\ngirls are still learning the rules\u201d, although\nMartha notes that they now explicitly ask\ncoaches to not call them \u201cgirls\u201d as not only is\nthis demeaning, but it would actually refer to\nunder-18s rugby.\nIn the same article, Imperial Ladies\u2019\nteam member Barbara dispels the idea that\nwomen aren\u2019t inclined to aggressive sports,\nwhich is an idea that Martha nevertheless\nfinds still pervades the sport. She doesn\u2019t un-derstand: \u201cit\u2019s a great outlet for women. Our\nplayers find it very cathartic.\u201d\nWhere the game does depend less on\nphysical strength, Martha argues is an advantage that further drives the team\u2019s diversity,\nexplaining \u201c[in women\u2019s rugby] there\u2019s less\nbrutish force and a higher level of skill. You\ncan kind of play wherever you want to on the pitch,\nwhereas with the men\u2019s it\u2019s like who\u2019s the biggest who\u2019s\nthe strongest. But because of the level of skill that we\nhave in the women\u2019s game and the higher priority skill\ntakes, it has a unique advantage really.\u201d\nShe feels this draws women to rugby, as girls rarely\nplay rugby at school, so many new members turn up to\nICUWRFC having never played before. \u201cI think what\nalso draws people to women\u2019s rugby is the diversity,\nacceptance and variation,\u201d Martha explains, adding\nthat it is \u201calso true for body sizes, which is not a lot the\ncase for a lot of sports.\u201d\nDespite having featured on national television in\nwhat Felix called a \u201cthoroughly entertaining and absorbing match,\u201d the club struggles to draw supporters.\nWomen\u2019s rugby was once again featured in the national press in 2015,\nthough for less\npositive reasons.\nThis should have\nbeen a good year\nfor the club, as\nthey headlined\nVarsity. However,\nfew people were\ntheretoseetheCollegevictorovertheMedics,aspoor-ly organised travel arrangements made by Sport Imperial meant most supporters deserted the pitch, leaving\nthe team stranded following the game. They felt they\nhad not received the same level of consideration as\ntheir male counterparts.\nAn investigation launched by Imperial supported\nthese claims; the College and Union resolved to further research students\u2019 experiences of sexism in sport at\nImperial. The 1752 Group - an organisation dedicated\nto ending staff sexual misconduct in higher education\n- felt the investigation \u201cpoints to an ingrained nature\nof sexism and misogyny,\u201d as, allegedly, the team were\nalso subject to sexist comments from both Imperial\nstudents and Sport Imperial staff.\nThe club has experienced change since then, telling Felix \u201cwe\u2019ve got a really good relationship with\nHarlington grounds management.\u201d Just this week they\nchristened the club house pitch with its first rugby\ngame.\nWhen they do have observers, they are not always\nwelcome. Martha tells Felix \u201cthis season we\u2019ve had\nmen on sidelines catcalling women in games, running\nonto the pitch, throwing things onto the pitch, and\nmaking offensive and inappropriate sexualised comments.\u201d The latter is not just from students, but by referees and coaches as well, she says.\nShe knows that rugby culture is at fault here, saying that articles such as that in the Daily Express show\nwhere the \u201cnegativity and disrespect\u201d the team experi-encetodaystemsfrom.Shepartiallyblamestheamount\nof drinking within the rugby community, which was\nalso identified as a factor in the 2015 investigation.

Natalia explains\nhow she feels that striking staff have\nbeen unfairly portrayed by the press,\nwho often discuss the impact on students in a way that villanises the staff.\nShe hopes that students visibily being on\nthe side of striking staff will undermine\nthese narratives.\nStaff are grateful for the support from\nstudents thus far, and hope to win over\nmore, vowing in Thursday\u2019s meeting to\n\u201cwork and communicate closely with\nstudents who already support us, and\ntalk to other students as much as we\ncan.\u201d\nWhilst the group gets off their\nground, she advises frustrated students\nto continue to channel their anger into\naction by emailing the president and\nprovost about the disruption.\nThe group will next meet on Thursday\n2nd March.\nContinued from page 3...\nLaunch of Cleantech for UK draws big\nnames to South Kensington campus\nAt approximately 3pm on Wednesday 15th February, crowds of students and staff began to form outside\nvarious entry points to Imperial Business\nSchool and the City and Guilds Building (CAGB). This followed circulation\naround campus of reported sightings -via group chats, social media, and word\nof mouth - of Microsoft founder Bill\nGates and UK Prime Minister Rishi\nSunak with Imperial College President\nHugh Brady and Vice Provost for Research and Enterprise Professor Mary\nRyan.\nMany people were wondering what\nbrought the pair of VIPs to the univer-sity, and the following comment from\nBrady might answer just that question.\nHe stated that \u201cachieving net-zero will\nrequire an enormous step-change in our\neconomy, industry, and civic systems.\nImperial College London, one of the\nworld\u2019s leading universities, has the tal-ent, resources, and influence to help accelerate the world towards this goal.\u201d\nSunak and Gates were at the College\nfor the launch of Cleantech for UK; a\ncoalition of parties aiming to invest in\nand support the development of \u2018clean\ntechnology\u2019 (e.g., renewable energy gen-erators, carbon capture technology).\nThe PM hopes that \u201ca new generation\nof talented British businesses can be\nconfident that they have the backing to\nunlock green solutions to some of the\nbiggest challenges we face\u201d, and believes\nthat \u201cinvesting in renewables and clean-tech is one of the best ways to strengthen\nenergy security, create better-paid jobs,\nand grow the economy\u201d.\nAfoundingmemberofthecoalitionis\nUndaunted, a new cleantech accelerator\nprogramme led by Imperial\u2019s Grantham\nInstitute for Climate Change in collaboration with The Royal Institution.\nBreakthrough Energy, a collection of investment firms founded by Gates, which\naims to stimulate change in the clean\nenergy sector, is another co-founder of\nthe coalition. Accelerator programmes\nact as a fast-track, supporting businesses\n- start-ups in particular - in preparing for\nand showcasing their product proposals\nto investors, who can then provide funding opportunities.\nGates believes that \u201cthe UK has all\nthe ingredients to become a major player in the global push to build a net-zero\nemissions future, including world-class\nresearch facilities and forward-looking\ninvestors.\u201d\nThree major clean technology scale-ups were showcased at the Cleantech\nlaunch, each with ties to researchers and\nto accelerator programmes at Imperial:\nCrop Intellect, an R&D firm in the\nagritech industry, is tackling clean technology for agriculture; their \u2018R-Leaf\u2019\ntechnology converts nitrogen-based air\npollutants into useful field-scale feed for\nplants, simultaneously reducing pollution and enabling better crop growth\nand food security. The\nstart-up\u2019s work has been\nsupported by Dr Andreas\nKafizas, a researcher specialising in light-activat-ed materials in Imperial\u2019s\nChemistry Department.\nH2Go Power is waiting\nfor a patent for their reactor that stores\nsolid-state hydrogen, which can then be\nreleased on-demand. Through their patented cleantech products, they aim to\nimprove the storage and management of\nthe renewable fuel hydrogen to encourage progress towards net-zero emissions.\nBased at Imperial\u2019s White City Innovation campus, the start-up was co-found-ed by Dr Enass Abo-Hamed, a Royal\nAcademy of Engineering Enterprise\nFellow associated with the College, and\nentered into Imperial\u2019s Climate-KIC\nAccelerator Programme in 2017.\nFinally,EconicLtd.isdevelopingtechnology to recycle carbon captured from\nthe atmosphere into cheap, sustainable\nplastic materials.

Econic was founded\nby Professor Charlotte Williams and Dr\nMichael Kember, who have both done\nwork at Imperial in the past. After participating in an Imperial climate accelerator in 2012, the company has now been\nable to develop and patent many of their\ninnovative technology designs.\nThe ideas behind these start-ups were\nall developed with the help and funding\nfrom investors, many of whom will have\nbeen introduced via climate accelerator\nprogrammes such as those at Imperial.\nCleantech for UK aims to \u2018supercharge\u2019\ninnovation by making funding more accessible to these kinds of start-ups. There\nis reportedly more than \u00a36 billion in investment funds available to young businesses that come up with viable clean-tech-based solutions for the UK to reach\nthe target of net-zero emissions by 2050.\nSunak also took the opportunity to\npublicise his recent restructuring of the\nDepartment for Business, Energy, and\nIndustrial Strategy (BEIS) into three\nnew distinct departments: Science, Innovation, and Technology; Energy SeZanna Buckland Co-Editor-in-Chief\nCo-founded by Imperial climate accelerator \u2018Undaunted\u2019, the Cleantech initiative\naims to increase funding and publicity for clean technology-based climate solutions.\nA crowd of students outside the main Imperial entrance hoping\nfor a glimpse of the PM and Bill Gates.

To keep our title hopes alive, we\nneeded a five-point victory, and we head\nto Harlington with the ambition to win\nwith at least four tries.\nThe game started off slowly with\nImperial scrambling to put pressure on\nRoehampton. Being the bigger team\nby a significant margin, Roehampton\nadopted the crudely simple, but highly\neffective strategy of running forwards.\nAmidstabloodinjuryreopeningonJonty\u2019sear,andshoulderinjuriesinflictedon\nboth Ben Shacks and Antoine, we struggled to cover the backfield.\nThe accumulation of mistakes and\nknock ons did not play in our favour,\nnor did their dirty play in the rucks and\nscrums. All in all, this made for a first\nhalf to forget, as we conceded four tries\nand two conversions. We felt our hopes\nof taking the title slipping away.\nStarting the second half supercharged\nand with a new strategy, we sent them\nright back to their own half immediately after kick-off. Putting them under\nenormous pressure, our pack obliterated theirs in a stellar scrum on their five,\novercoming the weight deficit. We felt\nour comeback slowly but surely creep in.\nOn the next sequence, our very own\ncaptain \u2018Finn Russell\u2019ed\u2019 a pass over the\nblitzing Roehampton backline to send\nDylan over. Try converted: 24-7.\nA few plays later, on a set play off\nscrum, Ferrari drew\nthree defenders all to himself to set up\nDylan for yet another magnificent try.\nThe conversion was a formality: 24-14.\nBoth on the sideline and on the pitch,\nRoehampton\u2019s spirits were crumbling as\nour confidence only grew. They couldn\u2019t\nseem to withstand the pressure, as a\nrepetition of foul plays in their 22s\nended up with a well-deserved yellow\ncard. From there, using a tactic from\ntheir playbook, a series of pick and\ngoes resulted in our third try of the day\nthrough Geraint Eickermann. The conversion narrowly sailed right, 24-19.\nAfter a few well-handled defensive\nsequences in our own half, the pressure\nwas back on Roehampton as we recovered the ball on the 50m line. Whether\ndescribed as a stroke of genius or of luck,\na kick over the Roehampton defence by\nLouis was recovered after a favourable bounce by Dylan,\nwho proceeded to celebrate\nbefore he had\ncrossed the\nline but dived\nover anyway\nfor his third\ntry on the day\nto bring us\nback level. We\nwatched as\nLouis kicked\nthe conversion to bring us 26-24 up.\nWith ten minutes to go, we knew that\nwe just had to maintain pressure on their\nnow fatigued players, and stop their fly-half, to bring us to victory. A last knock\non by the Roehampton players brought\nforth the final whistle as we completed\nour comeback victory to keep our title\nhopes \u2014 now more than ever \u2014 alive.\nCOCKS OF THE\nCOMPETITION\nTOBY\nGave a new meaning to \u2018getting your\nhead in the game\u2019 whilst piloting a\nnew tackling technique involving his\nface.\nIC HOCKEY MEN\u2019S IVS\nANDY\nSent off the pitch during the first\nhalf of ICURFC\u2019s game against\nRoehampton after arguing with the\nref.

An unwavering insistence on\nmaintaining academic standards leads\nto hefty workloads and tight deadlines.\nThen, a perceived reluctance to empa-thise with students and accept culpability for the resulting issues leads to accusations that the department is apathetic\nand defensive, and that its student-sup-port mechanisms are perfunctory and\ntokenistic.\nOne student told Felix, \u201cThe workload is so high that it leaves students very\nstressed and very overwhelmed with\nwhat they\u2019re doing. That is not an environment that\u2019s conducive to good mental health or being able to enjoy yourself\nin London.\u201d\nMany students speak of a problem of\noverassessment. \u201cThere are too many extra little tasks \u2014 an extra problem sheet\nhere, an extra bit of coursework there.\nTheydon\u2019taddawholelottothecourse\u201d.\nAfourth-yearphysicistgavetheexample of assessed problem sheets: \u201cIt was\ndevastating \u2014 late nights and high stress\nfor maybe 2.5% of a module.\u201d He said\nthat he never received feedback on the\nproblem sheets and was sometimes una-bletoidentifywherehehadgonewrong.\nDiscontent with feedback is wide-spread. Across year groups, students\nfeel that the marks they are awarded are\nnot proportional to the quality of their\nwork or the effort that they put in. Several students felt marks were awarded at\nrandom. \u201cIt was really very frustrating to\nputsomucheffortintoapieceofcourse-work for it to be up to a roll of the dice\u201d,\nsaid one second-year physicist.\nThe quality of help provided by teaching assistants (TAs) varies significantly.\n\u201cThe TAs are a bit of a crapshoot\u201d, explains a Physics undergraduate. \u201cSome\nof them are excellent and some you learn\nto avoid.\u201d\nThe same, students say, is true of laboratory demonstrators. They claim that\ndemonstrators didn\u2019t understand the\nnuances of the experiment, and would\nhave to consult the heads of experiments\n\u2014 who were often not present.\nOthers describe being paralysed by\nthe demonstrators\u2019 inattentiveness,\nwhose response to some questions was\nsimply, \u201cGoogle it\u201d. One told Felix, \u201cYou\nhave to spend so much time just figuring out how to start the bloody project.\nThat\u2019s one of the most frustrating parts.\u201d\nDeadlines\nExacerbating the problem is a tendency for deadlines to be stacked togeth-er. One student recounted an incident\nwhen they alerted the department\nto a deadline crunch; its response was to bring one of the\ndeadlines forward.\n\u201cResponses like this just\nlead students to think the\ndepartment doesn\u2019t care\nabout them\u201d, said a former student represent-ative.\nEven when empathy is shown by\nindividual teaching staff, students\nfeel that there is a\nculture of obstinacy in the wider\ndepartment. A\nstudent told us\nhow in her third\nyear she had four\ndeadlines in one\nweek, with multiple falling on the same\nday.\n\u201cWe spoke to the lecturer of one of\nthe modules, for which two of the assessments had ended up on the same day\ndue to the strikes. They were lovely and\nsaid,\u2018Yeah,thatsoundsfine.Thisdoesn\u2019t\nseem right that you\u2019re getting this kind\nof unfair knock-on effect because of\nstrikes.

Either they understand it so they\u2019ve got nothing to ask, or\nthey\u2019re too far behind to even bother going.\u201d This dichotomy seems to dissuade\nstudents from going, as one second-year\nstudent tells Felix. \u201cNo one who should\ngo to office hours goes to office hours.\nPeople would much rather just struggle\nand not have any sort of contact with\nmembers of the university than actually\nattend office hours\u201d.\nContinued from page 1...\nPhysics department woes\nNEWS\n4 felix@imperial.ac.uk felixonline.co.uk\nKEEP THE CAT FREE\nCredit: Jamie John/Felix\nTHE BEST\nREPRESENTATION\nOF HOW THIS\nCOURSE MAKES\nME FEEL IS THE\nSCENE FROM\nINDIANA JONES,\nWHERE THE\nNAZI\u2019S FACE IS\nMELTING.\n\n"

    "content": "FRIDAY 24TH FEBRUARY 2023\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk felixonline.co.uk 23\nEdited by: Gilbert Jackson\nSophie Pointon\nArts WHY YOU SHOULD VISIT THE BOOKSHOP THEATRE\nTHE ART OF CHURCHES\nARTS\nAfter a rather tedious set of exams and coursework\nlast summer, I found myself \u2018un-busy\u2019 in London.\nAs such, I decided to waste my time more wisely by finally exploring the city that had evaded my sights as a\nresult of the many cruel years of COVID-19 and its\naccompanying lockdowns. I set my sights firstly on the\nCity itself; the original square mile of London encompassed by ancient Roman walls which, when one first\njourneys to the City, feels like a completely separate\nentity entirely from the rest of the \u2018London: Expansion\nPack\u2019. Its somewhat estranged and separatist nature\nwas exactly why the City warranted an exploration,\nbut what I didn\u2019t realise was that my initial attempt to\nexplore the city would lead me to having an unusual\nside project.\nWhat I learnt from my now frequent visits to the\nchurches within the City walls (I should add: not for\nreligious reasons, purely for architectural reasons) is\nwithin these buildings is a plethora of art and history\nencased within granite walls and illuminated by chromatic glass: gorgeous architectural styles, unique\ninstallations within the buildings, and extensive\nchronicles regarding the buildings themselves\n\u2014 and the people that would have frequented them in the old days \u2014 lead to my fascination with these buildings and the start of\nmy project; to visit every church within\nthe City.\nWhatever your view is of\nchurch buildings, one must admit that they are pinnacles\nof the various architectural\nstyles that shaped Western\nEurope. The churches in\nLondon are no exception.\nWhat distinguishes them is that they were built in the\nEnglish Baroque style, instead of the more common\nGothic style found in other churches in the UK. In\nEurope, baroque dates from the late 16th\nto mid-18th\ncentury and was characterised by flamboyant neo-clas-sical (Greco-Roman) stylings which features large\ncolumns, porticos and heavily decorated reliefs. In\nEngland however, baroque came along much later than\ninotherEuropeannations,inthemid-17th\ncentury.The\nbirth of this new creative style was, ironically, born in\nthe aftermath of destruction, namely the Great Fire of\nLondon of 1666.\nLondon\u2019s buildings had been decimated by fire\nwhich destroyed most of its churches and houses.\nWith Charles II on the throne of England at the time,\nlove for art and music had returned after a period of\ndeep-rooted puritanism. The City in ruins was the perfect opportunity to embrace contemporary styles of\narchitecture, and Christopher Wren stepped up to the\nplate to usher in the English Baroque style which we\nseetothisdayinhismagnumopus,StPaul\u2019sCathedral.\nHowever, there\u2019s more to see in the City architecturally than just St Paul\u2019s. What we don\u2019t see as clearly is that Wren\u2019s style of architecture is featured in a\nmajority of all the churches in the City. Most Wren\nchurches aren\u2019t as rotund as St Paul\u2019s but they can be\neasily marked out by their tall tiered towers and\nwhite marble stone. Inside, you will be treated\nto stunning plaster work on the roof, \u2014\nsometimes paint- ed \u2014 and intricately carved Co- rinthian columns\nwhich are other signature\nstyles of Wren\u2019s architect u r e . What Wren\nachieves in his buildings are\na luxurious and stately form\nof architecture which, unlike\nEuropean baroque and rococo art, is still reserved and\nnot outrageously gaudy. They\nmaintain a sense of dignity\nand religiosity while remaining beautiful, but not entering\nthe realms of extravagance; he\ncreates a balanced and tasteful\nform of art which is exemplary of English sentiments\nat the time; keeping its Protestant and post-reformation\nethics.\nBut there is more to see in\nthese churches besides stunning plaster work and carved\ncolumns. One thing that you\nmight be surprised to find\nin these fairly old buildings\nis stained glass, which looks\ncompletely out of time compared with the rest of the\nbuilding.\nIf one takes a trip to St\nMary le Bow, St Michael\u2019s\nPaternoster Royal or even\nThe Temple Chur,ch you will\nfind jaw-droppingly stunning\nstained glass. The style of the\nglass is fragmentary, jagged\nand twisted. The colour of the\nglass is also unusual; strong\nreds and greens embolden\nthe glass and make it\nnoticeable as soon\nas you enter the\nbuilding. The\nreason for\nthis modern\ninstallation is\nonce again a\nflourishing of\ncreativity aft e r\ndeA original printed design of St Paul\u2019s Cathedral as envisaged by Christopher Wren\nHigh-Fidelity Wren-ditions\nArchitecture Article\nLondon\u2019sfinest.mostwell-hidden architecture.\nGilbert Jackson Arts Editor\n\n"

Meanwhile, Sheetal\nHanda from the BP International\nCentre for Advanced Materials calls\nImperial \u201cone of BP\u2019s key UK university\npartnerships\u201d, and Imperial worked with\nShell and Qatar Petroleum on a $70\nmillion Carbonates and Carbon Storage\nResearchCentre.Essentially,theCollege\nand the Student Union collaborate\nwith companies that are actively\ndegrading the environment for profit.\nIn contrast, Ecosia is a not-for-profit\ncompany that reinvests its revenue\ninto planting trees around the world.\nThe main source of Ecosia\u2019s income is\nserving ads to its customers. Since Ecosia\nstarted operations, they have managed\nto plant over 167 million trees in over\n13,000 planting sites thanks to the 20\nmillion users actively searching using\ntheir engine. Switching to Ecosia would\nreduce our collective carbon footprint.\nIn fact, students at Imperial College\nLondon have already contributed to\nthese figures! Ecosia has provided\na unique link (https://ecosia.co/\nImperialCollegeLondon) to Imperial\nCollege London, as part of the\nEOC campaign. Using this link, the\nstudents using Ecosia have already\ncaused over 1,000 trees to be planted\nthrough over 135,000 searches.\nThe Imperial Sustainability Strategy\nfor 2021-2026 lists goals to achieve\ncarbon neutrality as an institution by\nthe year 2040.

All you have to do is scan\nthe QR code and download the Ecosia\nbrowser extension and the mobile\napp. Start searching through Ecosia,\nand you\u2019ll be able to see how many\ntrees you\u2019ve helped plant. This will\nalso count towards Imperial College\u2019s\nstatistics. The more students and staff\nuse Ecosia, the stronger of a case there\nwill be for the college to switch to it.\nWhy should people use Ecosia over\nGoogle?\nGoogle has been carbon\nneutral since 2007, but Ecosia\nis carbon positive. Ecosia doesn\u2019t\njust plant trees \u2014 it also\nproduces renewable\nenergy to power\nits operations.\nIt produces\ntwice the\namount\nit needs\na n d\nsupplies\nthe remaining\nto the grid,\nmaking it greener.\nEcosia is not a\nprofit-minded corporation.\nThey pay their taxes diligently and\nhonestly, helping fund schools, nature\nconservation, and foreign aid. Google is\nknown to have exploited legal loopholes\ninthepasttopaylesstaxthantheyaredue,\nusing shell corporations to direct money\nto offshore accounts. In fact, Google\nwas accused of tax avoidance policies for\nseveral years, and they had to pay \u00a3130\nmillion in back-payments to the HMRC\nin 2016. Google and parent company\nAlphabet are answerable to investors,\nso may place profit as the top priority.\nEcosia is also better for the privacy-minded individuals.

A\ncouch, table, and potted plant hanging\nits leaves off a shelf: a student office. A\nblack leveled stage: the studio. A podi-um: the final stage. The background was\na simple white sheet, with varying lights\nshown onto the background to express\nanger, greed, regret and despair, ambi-tion, and success. The excellent use of a\nminimal background to shift focus onto\nthe characters allowed the cast to shine.\nAdditionally, the songs and lyrics were\nrelatable and fitting to the storyline. I\nparticularly liked the emphasis on each\nword in the quote; \u201cCan he fix it? Yes.\nHe. Can\u201d. Ballads reflected struggles,\nwhile rap communicated the anger\nbetween the two main characters. Musical director Yoshua revealed post-play\nthat score development began in June\n2022 and that the entire melodic band\nconsisted of volunteering members who\npresented their individual talents; pi-ano, drums, violin, flute, cello, electric\nand acoustic guitar and bass. Ten songs\nwere written, each as unique as the play\nitself. Consequently, the script allowed\nfor characters to break the fourth wall,\nwhich was used exquisitely to include\nthe audience; such as when Juliet pointed out that the upset Charlie had not\n\u201cspoken a single word since this intermission,\u201d or when Charlie asked the audience \u201cwhere is the nonsense?\u201d in Alexander\u2019s supposedly \u201cboring\u201d play.\nCleverly written for its audience, the\nreferences to the Imperial Horizons\nmodules and the Sherfield Building\nallowed the student audience to feel\nspecial and included. The audience applauded as often as they could, especially\nduring transitions. They clapped for the\nenergised and rhythmic choreography\nand cheered when the lyrics became\nso real, it made my mouth drop. If any\nviewers may have also noticed, the two\nopposite scripts, one with a blue (Charlie\u2019s) cover and the other in red (Alexander\u2019s), were merged to produce a purple\nscript; a thoughtful detail to promote\nthe beauty of merging ideas.\nDirector Zethus Chow commented\nthat the play was \u201cas good as [he] can\nhope for\u201d, while production worker Rachel Soh expressed that she very much\nappreciated the soundtrack.\nWithin three months, the\nmembers casted characters, re-hearsed, booked venues, raised\nfunds, and organised themselves to deliver a memorable\nshow.\nIt is truly a shame that the\nbudget was only sufficient for\none show, as, besides one mi-crophone-related technical\nfailure, which was professionally recovered twice by Josh\nAbraham Jacob, the show was\nunforgettable. I would recommend watching out for next\nyear\u2019s ME, as you may feel inspired to\njoin the cast or the society; everyone is\ninvited to join.

Despite spending every summer\nin the UK since I was born, I had never visited the area, and felt it was somewhere I should explore for its history.\nWe got on the tube at South\nKensington and headed for Greenwich\nstation. Citymapper shows you a couple\nof line changes, but you can take the\nDistrict line to Monument and walk\na little way to Bank station, which\nconnectsyoutoDLR\u2013DocklandsLight\nRail. The Light Rail from Bank will\ntake you directly to Greenwich station,\nwhich is more or less in the centre of\nGreenwich. It\u2019s a scenically interesting\njourney through part of Zone 2,\nincluding Canary Wharf \u2013 much nicer\nthan travelling through tunnels!\nGetting off the Light Rail at around\nlunchtime, we went in search of a\ntraditional English meal, and, not\nfinding a proper pub (barring a gigantic\n\u2018Spoons\u2019), we landed in London\u2019s \u2013 nay,\nthe UK\u2019s \u2013 most controversial fish and\nchips joint: \u2018Jack the Chipper\u2019!

Their d\u00e9cor is fun and\nwhimsical, with portraits of old movie\nstars, retro adverts, and vinyl records; \u2013\nthe latter a fitting addition given they\u2019re\nlocated right across the street from a\ncomprehensive record store. The staff\nwere super friendly and helpful, and\nmade sure we had everything we needed.\nSitting in front of the store window, we\nwere also able to people-watch while\nwe ate \u2013 which is always a fun pastime.\n(If you don\u2019t quite want to travel as far\nas Greenwich, their original branch is\nlocated in Whitechapel (the original\nhunting ground of Jack the Ripper).\nWe dipped into the record store \u2013\n\u2018Casbah Records\u2019 \u2013 for a few minutes,\nbut as much as we wanted to, we avoided\nspending too much time browsing\nits extensive stock of vinyl and CDs\nto ensure we could see all the sights\nnearby. The Greenwich area looks a lot\nlike a quaint English town, as if you\u2019d\ntravelled outside of London, except that\nwhen you reach the edge of the river the\nskyscrapers on the other side are a stark\nreminder that you\u2019re still in the city.\nBesides the Meridian, Greenwich is\nalso known as the resting place of Cutty\nSark, a 19th\ncentury sailing ship that\ngives off pirate vibes \u2013 a cool monument\nto take pictures in front of! Giving into\nour STEM student nature, we rejected\nthe tour of the ship\u2019s history in favour of\nexploring the Greenwich Foot Tunnel,\nthe neighbouring under-river footpath.\nThe tunnel spans the width of the\nThames and emerges at the Isle of Dogs\nontheotherside.CuttySarkalsoalludes\nto the Old Royal Naval College nearby,\nwhich earned Maritime Greenwich its\nname.

It featured in Thor:\nThe Dark World, and it\u2019s easy to see\nwhy (besides the mystical connotations\nof the meridian itself), as the grand\nbuildings could match those at Oxford\nand Cambridge, and there are vast lawns\nfor students and visitors alike to enjoy.\nGreenwich Park is a mixture,\nbetween Hyde Park and Primrose Hill,\nof sprawling expanses of grass and a\nGreenwich: home of the Meridian\nZanna Buckland Co-Editor-in-Chief\nEdited by: Charlotte Probstel\nFood&Travel\nCredit: Zanna Buckland\nWhy chase the equator when the Meridian is so near?\nThe Pavilion Caf\u00e9 in Greenwich Park.\nfood.felix@imperial.ac.uk felixonline.co.uk\nFRIDAY 24TH FEBRUARY 2023\n41\nFOOD & TRAVEL\n\n"

In February, they went\nto the East India Tea Company, Postcard Teas (which has very cute packag-ing), and Carnaby Street\u2019s \u2018My Cup of\nTea\u2019 had pots of tea that were of better\nquality than the classic high tea.

Interactive. Original.\nOn Sunday the 19th\nat the Britten\nTheatre, the Singaporean Society, or\nSingSoc, checked off every single criterion of a truly special play within a play.\nThe Singaporean Society celebrated\nthe 40th\nAnniversary of its Major Event\n(ME); a musical portraying the issues\nSingaporeans experience daily, by telling the story of how they struggled with\norganizing the ME in 2022. Accompanied by original music and lyrics written by Joshua Yong, its cast, band, prop\nartists, lights producers, and director\nconfirmed that Imperial is more than\njust a research and STEM university; it\nis filled with art and musical talent.\nThe story follows Elaine, the ME\nOrganisor (MEO) played by Vanathi\nPugalendhi, who struggles with choosing one of two scripts; a well-written serious play by Alexander (Josh Abraham\nJacob) and one comedic play written by\nCharlie (Alex Li); a rookie. Her compromise of merging the two scripts leads\nto continuous fights between the two\nwriters whose leadership exhausts the\ncrew, leading to a dictatorial leadership,\na coup, a mass walk-out, and finally no\ntrueprogress.Theplayendswiththetwo\nwriters finding greatness in each other\u2019s\nscripts and learning to move past their\nstubbornness to achieve their common\ngoal; an incredible ME show. The story\nalso follows Juliet (Sunnie Ow), who\njoined the ME, searching for friendships\nand fun.\nMany themes appeared in the play;\nthe struggle of leadership, trade-offs\nwithin compromise, accepting faults,\nstepping out of your comfort zone, the\nweight of compassion, and modernism\nvs traditionalism. Written for an audience that experiences difficult moments\nof group work, the script highlighted\nissues we all, as college students, experience daily. Great leadership arises\nwhen a voice is given to its people and a\ngroup doesn\u2019t exist without its people; a\ntheme emphasized by the absence of the\ncrew as without the crew, there cannot\nbe a show. Moreover, a few scenes were\ndedicated to depicting the downfall of a\ndictatorship, when Alexander loses the\ncrew\u2019s respect after over-working them\nand prioritizing work over fun; an important aspect of societies.\nWhileMulanhadMushuandAladdin\nhad the genie, SingSoc had not one, but\nthree comedic reliefs: the music director\nwho communicated only via the sound\nof his violin; the photographer giving\nObi-Wan Kenobi-like advice while taking poorly-timed pictures, and finally\nCharlie; the whimsical script-writer\nwith unrealistic artistic visions and a\nmassive cast for one showcase. Otherwise, a single \u201cquack\u201d or \u201cOh s***, it\u2019s not\nmy scene yet\u201d released a roar of laughter\nfrom the packed audience. A banana\nused as a gun, a dinosaur replaced with\na tree, a floss dance, a flirtatious moment\nbetween a boy and girl, a radioactive\nscript, kicking a door of air, characters\nsocializing with swans, references to Spider-man, Star Wars, the Phantom of the\nOpera and many more tension-breaking\nmoments made me laugh tears.\nFurthermore, the props and lighting/\nsound directors James Tay and Rachel\nThe Singaporean Society\u2019s Major Event was an evening of roaring laughter and cheering to support the talented cast and band.\n\u201cA musical written by scriptwriters\u201d\nCharlotte Probstel\nSocieties Writer\nMY BEST FRIENDS\nARE IN THIS\nSOCIETY\n\u201c\nAlex Li (left) as Charlie, and Josh Abraham Jacob (right) as Alexander.\nTea Society laughing while drinking tea.

How can there be\ndrug resistance if no drugs exist?\n\u201cDr Neuman is partially right. He was\nspeaking half a century ago when anti-fungal drugs had not been developed\nand there was no effective way of\ntreating an invasive fungal infection, and\ntoday it is still very difficult. Fungi are a\nsister kingdom to animals, and drugs\nthat harm fungi often\nalso cause damage\nto human cells.\nAnti-f ung a l\ndosage has\nto be very\nspecific and\nmost act\njust to limit\nf u n g a l\ngrowth\nrather\nt h a n\nactually\nkilling the\ncells. Once a fungus\ncolonisesabodilycompartment,\nwhich might be totally obscure, it can\nbe very hard to actually deliver the anti-fungal to the correct area.\u201d\nProfessor Fisher started his academic\ncareer as a zoologist, studying at\nEdinburgh University whilst focused\non parasitology. The realisation that\nmost parasitologists spend their careers\nstudying, in his words, animal shit, led\nto a change of heart and a move to postdoc work in a lab researching the valley\nfever fungus at University of California,\nBerkeley. Now, having been at Imperial\nfor 18 years, his office is on the 11th\nfloor of the Sir Michael Uren building\nat the White City campus, which has\none of the most astounding panoramic\nviews of London I\u2019ve ever seen. Stepping\ninto his office I am bombarded by frogs.\nNo real ones, as far as I could see, but\nartwork of a frog sitting next to some\nmushrooms flank framed copies of the\nprestigious scientific journals Science\nand Nature, displaying amphibians on\ntheir front covers in reference to Mat\u2019s\nwork on fungal epidemics that have\ndevastatedglobalfrogpopulations.Why\ndoamphibiansgetsuchahardtimefrom\nfungi?\n\u201cAmphibians were the first things\non four legs to leave the oceans and\ncome into contact with the fungi\nthat already existed on the land, and\ntheir skin is a two-way exchange that\nprovides a perfect entry point for fungi.\nThey had to evolve defences against\ninvaders immediately and today\u2019s\namphibians produce an amazing array\nof antimicrobials from bodily glands.\nThey are actually very resistant to fungal\ninfections, so it was quite shocking for\nthe scientific community to see, around\nthe middle of the 20th century, swathes\nof amphibians dying across the world as\na result of a fungal infection. The culprit,\na chytrid fungus, was spread partly as a\nresult of human globalisation exposing\nthe fungus to amphibian populations\nthat hadn\u2019t seen it before, and is the\nmost destructive infectious disease ever\nin terms of damage to biodiversity,\nincludingallvirusesandbacteria.InAsia,\nthis fungus has evolved alongside native\namphibians and doesn\u2019t cause them\nany harm, but other populations are\ndefenceless. If you go to the neotropics\nnow you will hardly hear a frog calling,\nas a result of this infection.\u201d\nSome viruses, such as SARS-CoV-2,\ncancauseinfectionthroughasfewasone\nvirus particle entering the body. This is\nalmost always not the case with fungi; a\nsignificant dose is normally required for\nan infection to take root, and very large\ndoses of even the most commonplace\nfungus that one would find in a garden\ncompost bin can cause a fatal infection\nin a healthy human. \u201cDosage is hugely\nimportant. Macrophages, immune cells\nthat normally swallow anything unusual\ntheycomeacrossintheblood,arethefirst\nline of defence against fungal invaders. If\nthe dose is high enough to overwhelm\nthe macrophages present in your blood,\nan infection can get a foothold in your\nbody. Some fungi also have the ability\nto manipulate macrophages and survive\nevenafterthey\u2019vebeenswallowed,which\nturns the macrophage from a defensive\nplayertoavehiclethattrafficsthefungus\naround the body. We think this might\nbe because macrophages are a lot like\namoeba, single celled organisms that\nprey on fungi in the wild, which fungi\nhave evolved defences against.\u201d\nThereisstillsomereasonforpositivity.\nTheWorldHealthOrganizationrecently\nreleased its first fungal priority pathogen\nlist, signalling to the medical research\ncommunity that fungi are a force to\nbe reckoned with.

As the field of medicine\nhas advanced, scholars have sought a\nmore robust explanation for the girls\u2019\nsymptoms. An explanation more likely\nthan \u2018bewitchment\u2019 is ergot poisoning,\ncaused by the ingestion of by-products\nof the fungus Claviceps purpurea, well-suited for colonising moist rye crop.\nPeople who ingest rye grains infected\nwith C. purpurea may be consuming\ndangerous quantities of lysergic acid,\nan LSD precursor that can wreak havoc\non the nervous system. People suffering\nfrom ergot poisoning may appear\nhysterical and report crawling sensations\nacross the skin as well as hallucinations.\nContinued exposure causes ergotism \u2014\nalsocalledStAnthony\u2019sFire\u2014sonamed\nfor the intense burning pain it causes in\nthe extremities, ultimately leading to\ngangrene as blood supply is consistently\ncut off.\nThe damage caused by C. purpurea is\njustoneofmanyexcruciating,fascinating\nexamples of fungal infection and\ntoxicity that Matthew Fisher, Professor\nof Fungal Epidemiology at Imperial\nCollege gives me, as we sit down to talk\nabout HBO\u2019s new hit series The Last of\nUs (TLOU), and fungal pathologies in\ngeneral. My idea to interview a fungus\nexpert in the wake of TLOU\u2019s release\nwas not as original as I had hoped, I\nquickly learned. The day prior, Mat\nhad done an interview for American\nbroadcaster CNN on the same topic,\nas one of a relatively small network\nof fungus experts who have recently\nfound themselves inundated with public\ninterest (Mat pronounces it \u2018fun-ji\u2019\nrather than \u2018fun-guy\u2019, if any pedants\nwere wondering). While media requests\nno doubt take their toll, the attention\nis an overall good thing for the field;\nfungal diseases are largely overlooked\nby the public as a major health concern,\neven though fungal infections cause\naround 1.6 million deaths per year, more\nthan those caused by HIV and malaria\ncombined. Fungus research receives\nonly 5% of the funding that the \u2018sexier\u2019\nfields such as bacterial-antimicrobial\nresistance, malaria, and others receive.\nThis lack of attention leads to deaths\nthat would be avoidable if medics were\ntrained to spot fungal infections as well\nas bacterial ones; fungal meningitis\ntreated with antibiotics will continue to\ndamage its host unscathed.\nThe scope of fungal infections, even\nin the developed world, is astounding.\nProfessor Fisher tells me that as many as\n30% of ICU patients whose lungs were\nbadly damaged by COVID-19 also went\non to be infected by Aspergillus \u2014 a\ncommon mould present in almost every\nbreath we take, but which is normally\nshut down by our immune system even\nbefore we know it\u2019s there. For this same\nreason, abnormal fungal infections in\nthe lungs of gay men were one of the\nfirst signs that the HIV/AIDS epidemic\nwas taking hold during the \u201880s. Things\nare likely to get worse. Obesity rates are\nsoaring across the world, particularly\nin the West, where an abundance of\nfatty and sugary foods lead to weight\ngain and increased risk of diabetes.\nFungi thrive in sugary environments,\nand the saccharine blood of a diabetic\nis an optimal environment for some\nfungal pathogens once they enter the\nbloodstream.Steroidsprescribedtotreat\nsevere SARS-CoV-2 infections down-regulate macrophage activity, opening\nthe doors for fungi to slip in.\nAfter spending far longer than\nplanned jumping from one astounding\npathogen to another (I did suggest that\nMat write a popular science book on the\nsubject, but he valiantly said he was too\nbusywithhisresearch)wegettothemeat\nof why we\u2019re doing this interview. Could\na pandemic such as the one seen in The\nLast of Us, caused by a brain-controlling\nfungus, actually happen? No, is the short\nanswer. \u201cFungi such as Cordyceps, the\ninfective agent in The Last of Us spend\nmillennia evolving to thoroughly infect\nand control specific species of insect.\nThey can\u2019t even jump from one type\nof ant to another. The odds of such a\nspecific infective agent adapting to\ninfect humans are vanishingly small,\nas everything the fungus uses\nto infect that one insect is\nexquisitely honed to its\nbody. That being said,\nthere is an analogy\nto be drawn with\nTo x o p l a s m a\ngondii (a\nmalaria-like\np a t h o g e n\nthat infects\nm i c e ,\nc a u s i n g\nthem to\nb e h a v e\nerratically\nand present\nthemselves\nto cats to be\neaten). T.\ng o n d i i\nhas a\nlifecycle\nt h a t\nr e q u i r e s\nit be eaten\nby a cat, but\ncan also infect\nhumans, which are\nalmost never preyed upon.\nInfected humans also undergo\nbehavioural manipulation, but much\nmore bluntly, where they essentially\nare just more likely to partake in risky\nbehaviour. It\u2019s possible that a similar\njump could be made by a fungus, but\nit would almost certainly just result in\nbehavioural changes and would not be\ntransmissible to other humans once in\nan initial host. This would essentially\nleave it with a similar effect to C.\npurpurea. We\u2019ve not\nseen this sort of expert behavioural\nmanipulation infection spill over from\ninsects into other animals before.\u201d\nThe opening scene of the series is of a\nCould The Last of Us really happen?

You just can\u2019t\nlisten to the \u2018Looking For Somebody (To Love)\u2019, which\nis currently my favourite track, and not be tapping your\nfeet, skipping down the street or belting it out on your\nbike.\nThealbumdoesn\u2019tfallshortofthefamous1975-style\nacoustic tracks either. \u2018All I Need to Hear\u2019 & \u2018When We\nAre Together\u2019 are pure bait for the hopeless romantics,\nwhich if I am honest, is a nice change of pace from the\nheavier acoustic songs like \u2018Nana\u2019, \u2018She Lays Down\u2019, or\neven \u2018Be My Mistake\u2019.\n\u2018Wintering\u2019 was perhaps my favourite Christmas\nsong of 2022. It is so candid and filled with harmless\nwitty conversational lyrics like \u201cOlivia has been a vegan since ten\u201d and \u201cBen is obsessed with fat asses and\nhe is ten years old\u201d. It also served as a gateway into the\nSpotify \u201cIndie Christmas\u201d Playlist, which, by the way,\nis also very good.\nThe best lyrics of the track have to be from \u2018Part of\nthe Band\u2019 and my god it is a gold mine. It is hard to\neven pick out a line to highlight because every line is so\ndamn good. Here are some of my personal highlights:\n\u201cI like my men like I like my coffee/Full of soya milk\nand so sweet, it won\u2019t offend anybody\u201d\n\u201cAm I ironically woke? The butt of my joke?/Or am\nI just some post-coke, average, skinny bloke/Calling\nhis ego imagination?\u201d\n\u201cThe worst inside of us begets/that feeling on the internet./It\u2019s like someone intended it/(Like advertising\ncigarettes)\u201d\nBefore I quote the entire song, I\u2019ll just address the\nelephant in the room which is the all-too-controver-sial Matty Healy. All kinds of names have been thrown\naround (e.g., \u2018preachy\u2019, \u2018arrogant\u2019, \u2018cocky\u2019, and \u2018asshole\u2019)\nand to that I will give the same answer as\nwhat Matty would say if you asked him\nwhat genre The 1975 falls into \u2014 yes!\nHe is all of those things, and they are\nnot things I necessarily admire. Yes, he is\nannoying in those aspects, but the quality\nthat I admire is his sincerity (is scary) and\n\u2018post-modern\u2019 humour, which is very apparent now because he basically reviewed\nhimself again and again in every single al-bum, making the reviewers\u2019 job redundant\n(note how I didn\u2019t say my job).\nI think his lyrics masterpiece such as \u201cI\nknow some Vaccinista tote bag chic baris-tas, sitting in east on their Communista\nkeisters, writing about their ejaculations\u201d\nis controversial and by no means subtle,\nbut it has brilliantly captured the more\ncontroversial political debates and expressed a viewpoint on it. You can\u2019t possibly say that is preachy, it is just having an\nopinion!\nI don\u2019t agree with all of Matty\u2019s political viewpoints,\nbut I respect that he has taken a stance and, more often\nthan not, he packages arguments in a funny and ironic\nway where you can never really tell if he\u2019s joking or not,\njust have a look at his chicken shop date with Amelia.\nAnyways,toendonamorepositivenote,IhatedThe\n1975 when I was 16.
