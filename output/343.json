    "content": ", Page 2 FELIX October 27th,1973 ITERS\nDear Friends,\nAs one who is not a student, but a worker in a university bookshop in London, I would be most grateful if you would allow me the use of your\ncolumns to make an appeal to your readers.\nA group of people in Phoenix, Arizona are attempting to raise funds to buy medical material\nfor those workers in Chile who are in armed conflict with the military regime. The following is\npart of a letter from this group which was published by the Anarchist paper \" Freedom\" in the\nissue dated 2 9 . 9 . 7 3 :\n\" Money is urgently needed by Chilean workers,\nstudents and radicals. As we know Allende is\ndead, along with5,000 of his fellow workers.\nStudents, workers are still waging fierce battles\nagainst junta troops. Workers have taken over\nfactories and are still producing \u2014 while being\nbombed by junta planes! Workers in Valparaiso surprised junta groups and re-captured half the\ntown. Soldiers and low-level officers in the south\nof Chile are grouping with armed radical groups\nof working people and moving towards Santiago.\nThe junta military invaded the University of Santiago and murdered hundreds of students. Leftists\nand supporters are being rounded up and summarily shot. Political exiles \u2014 around300 \u2014 in Chile have been rounded Up and shot.\"( I think there could be some doubt as to the\naccuracy of classifying Allende as a worker, but I think in the context of this appeal that is neither\nhere nor there.)\nUpon reading this I sent the group a letter requesting further information, as events in Chile\nwere moving at a rapid pace, and their reply, in\npart, is as follows:\n\" At present (letter dated 6.10.73) information\non the junta takeover is vague. One important\naspect is the growing boldness of 'respectable'\njournalistic purveyors within Chile who are step-png a little more heavily on the toes of print\ncensorship by writing more of the reality inside\nthan the junta feels is necessary. American news\nsources are speaking less timidly. We' ve learnt\nmore of the slaughter, round-ups, tortures, intimidation s, book burnings, etc., from big established\nnewspapers now. At first they were silent, now they're speaking louder. Of course, we don't expect them to encourage armed revolution or to\nag.tate the U.S. Government to condemn and not\nrecognize the usurpers. I think the point at which the U.S. Press kissed a little less as s was when news of growing, sanctioned antiSemitism came\nout. ' El Mur curio' \u2014 the right-wing paper \u2014 printed a letter, very prominently, which cast Allende a jaco g in the ' Jew Communist Conspiracy' and concluded by urging a pogrom of Chilean Jews. The author wanted, as succ our,' a Jew hanging\nfrom every lamp-post in Santiago'. This, the incidents of book burning by the army and eye-wit nes to torture and summary execution, so\nreminiscent of Hitler (among others) seemed to\nmake the big shot news publishers uneasy. Consequently, more news is coming from these agen-cie s. My own news sources are from Asia News Service, Presna Latina, Inter News Service and NACL A. We plan to issue a pamphlet or news\nsummary of the events within two weeks. At the\nmoment, information on contacts, financial dis-per sion, etc. is vague\u2014rather, we are still nut ur ing our leads. We're trying to co-ordinate (if our\nimmediate contacts fail) relief work with a group\nin Berkeley, California. We anticipate a long\nperiod of waiting for strong, reliable contacts to\ndevelop \u2014 but we're optimistic. If however, all\navenues ere unsuccessfully exhausted, we'll in form ea cn contributor and either refund the contribution or use it elsewhere.\" There is very little students or workers in this\ncountry can do at the present time to directly\nassist the Chilean workers but supporting this\nfund does make some contribution to their struggle. Please send all money and information on further contacts in Chile or Argentine to: DARIO Mc DARBY,14221 E. VIRGINIA, PHOENIX, ARIZ ON A85006, U.S.A. Yours sincerely, Leonard Still.\nDillons University Bookshop Ltd.,\nMail Order Department,\n1 Male t St.,\nLondon, WC1.( Envelope marked ' PERSONAL') USK\nENTSHEET\nDe a rEd, This year we are hoping\nto put the old U.S.K. Ents\nsheet on a more solid bas-is, bringing it out regularly every Wednesday. Work will start on Tuesday\nlunch-time in the Union Office area, and we would\nappreciate any offers of\nhelp, especially with stapling in the evening, and\nwith distribution.\nAny notices should be\nin the U.S.K. pigeon hole\nby Tuesday lu noh times \u2014if\nyou have any information\non Events, 'please send it\nin. We also need contacts\nin the other colleges\nroundabout, if anyone\nknows of anyone \"outside\"\nwho would be interested\nin helping, would they\nplease drop us a line.\nThanks, and do drop by,\nChris and Paul.\nMRPHY^\nDAY\nDear Editor,\nI feel (often), as President of the Royal School\nof Mines, that I should\nwarn all those bumpkins\nand general scrape-the-barrel slag who intend to\noppose us on Morphy\nDay (See and Pee and\narse-ease-rest are the\ntechnical descriptions of\nthe enemy): that we shall\nwin. That we shall take\nno prisoners. Rape, plunder and loot are our battle orders, and the safest\nthing for them is to keep\ntheir life insurance policies intact and slink\nquietly from the battle-field.\nThe oar will be ours,\nand our ladies rowing\neight will win, while our\never-victorious Rugby\nteam crushes in turn\ntheir opponents on some\nfar-flung field.\nRemember you have\nbeen warned. We have\nalready won, our firepower is invincible, our\ncrack troops will not\nwaver. Heed not the call\nto battle of your pre si dents, you alone will be\nthe one to suffer.\nPaul Gee.\nNOT\nFOOLED\nSir,\nSo we cannot get anything out of the Tory\ngovernment (not even\n\u00a320 increase on the\ngrant). Thank you for\nmaking it clear this week. Therefore your\nsolution is to replace the\nTory government by a\" Labour government\npledged to socialist poli-cie s\". Two main questions then arise.\n1. According to your\nown argument, the Tories are being forced to\nattack the living standards of the working class because of the\nrapidly deepening economic crisis which, as you point out in your editorial of October 1 6 th, is\ntaking place on a world scale not just in Britain.\nWhen( if) a Labour government lis elected, I doubt very much that\nthe world economic crisis will respond to this\nby disappearing, so will not the Labour government be forced to carry\nout the same policies to\ntry and provide some\nsolution to this crisis?2. You want a Labour\ngovernment pledged to\nsocialist policies. The Labour party is always\npledged to socialist poli-cie s. But, you may not\nremember the last Labour government. I do.I can remember \" In place\nof strife\", the Labour\nprices and incomes pol-icy, high unemployment\nunder Labour; I can remember when troops\nwere sent in to break the\n1 9 6 6 dock strike, and the Labour governments'\nsupport for the Southern\nAfrican regime, for U.S. aggression in Vietnam\nand for Israels' expansionist policies. And it\nwas a Labour government that sent troops to\nsuppress the people of\nNorthern Ireland. With such a record, I doubt if\nmost people are fooled\nany longer by these\nthese 'socialist policies'.\nYours sincerely,\nKathleen Corcoran. Autonomy\nWarning\nDear Sir,\nLast week'sU GM expressed a serious contra-diction. The argument in favour of the Union withholding money from the\nCollege equal to the refectory price increases was\ndefeated by someone\npointing out that the College has complete control\nover Union finances. The College would merely deduct the same amount\nfrom the Union's funds, as\nit could equally do in the\ncase of a rent strike.\nAttempting to launch\nserious campaigns to defend I.C. students' interests let alone the interests\nof exploited groups outside College, while the\nUnion has no real autonomy, is naive and shows\nours to be a Union with*;\nout priorities.\nJoe Herbertsom\n(Met.\nARE SCIENTISTS\nILITTERATE?\nThe sce inti st( that is a cording to the other\nlot, is uncultured, narrow minded, and ign a rant on any subject outside their own chosen subject,\nin fact they can hardly read nor write.

(What happened to the\nCloggies, for one thing \u2014 and Pseud's Corner and Barry McKenzie?'. it's not\nthe best \u2014 it's more like a random\nsample picked out from the last couple\nof years. You could say it is exceedingly\nboring. The usual hate figures get their\nshare of paper darts. Some of it is childish and self-indulgent (anything's funny\nif you hear it often enough, often enough\n. . . often enough . . . get it?) and some\nalready seems dated; about as useful\nand interesting as a collection of vintage\npotato crisps. Some, of course, is very\nfunny indeed:\nSecond Carriage\nH.l vl.

Duke of Edinburgh.\nWell, you either like it or you don't. But unless you're an incurable addict\n(remember, it can damage your\nhealth) this is not a book to buy. It's worth the odd look in the shops, though;\nyou might get a laugh or two.\nY AUTOBIOGRAPHY\nby Charles Chaplin\nThe title is \" My Autobiography\", and it is. Chaplin's writing is as personal\nand as dead-pan as his camera-work;\nWhat he saw, felt and thought is here,\nstated so baldly that you sometimes\nwonder if the book is a translation.\nThe memories near the beginning, and\nthe- anecdotes in the rest of the book,\nare strung along apparently at random\nand it was not until 1 had been carried\nthrough several scenes that 1 became\nconscious of the easy directness of his\napproach. This is the essence of Chaplin, in p, int. and with it comes the\nrealisation that in his private life he\nwas an artist and by no means the\nclown and tramp.\nAs a child he Knew extreme poverty,\nbut does not fall into the trap of glorifying it: \"1 found poverty neither attractive nor edifying. It taught me nothing\nn. ore than a distortion of values, an\noverrating of the virtues and graces of\nthe rich and the so-called better classes\".\nHe toured America with the Karno\nCompany, and later re iur ned there full\nof hopes and dreams to distill the inimitable tramp. The story cf that process\nis one which most of us, as s.ud ents, will hope to parallel. '\n,\nChaplin was 21 when he first saw\nBroadway and New York and his descriptions of those places and of his feelings for them would fit many fresher s coming to London for the first time:\nthe distractions, im personality, impetuosity and occasional beauty of a big\ncity and a legend. More than anything\nelse, this feeling of identity and comprehension draws one into sympathy with\nhim. Also thought provoking are his\ncomments on the attitudes and posturing of the press and the American bureaucratic system.\nIn its early chapters, the book is full\nof memories of London before the First\nWorld War \u2014 habits and a. way of life\nnow totally lost. There is material here\nfor the sociologist and historian, as well\nas interest for the casual browser. Later,\nthe book becomes more anecdotal, is full\nof well-worn names, some new old gossip and characteristic snatches of homely\nphil is oph y, yet remains readable and\nabsorbing. The pictures, and there are\n113 of them, tend to be blurry period\nprints and newspaper snaps, but they\nfit, and give valuable glimpses of the\nsurroundings and social strata through\nwhich Charlie gravitated.\nAny Chaplin-fans, film-fanatics and\ndevoted nost aig is ts will have snapped\nup the first printing: if you want to\nknew rao.e about the man behind the\nclown and be given an absorbing view\nof the world \"as it was\" into the bargain,\ntry this snip at 65p. \"After all \u2014\n(P.320) \u2014 \"there are more valid facts\nand details in works of art than there\nare in history books\".\nCandi\nHEATRI\nn sti* urn 6\nAlmost free theatre\nNowadays lunchtime drama is becoming very popular in London, attracting an audience from office workers and\nthe urban populace that cannot stay in town late just to see a play. The Almost\nFree Theatre is one theatre running a series of lunchtime plays, and I went to\nsee Instrument for Love by Jennifer\nPhillips, which is running at 1.15 p.m.( except Sundays) until October 27th. The theatre auditorium is very small\nso that an intimate relationship is maintained between the actors and the audience which is exploited by the cast\nvery well so that the audience actually\nfeels that they are an integral part of\nthe action and not just passive ob ser vers.\nThe play itself is about four people\nwho snatch a picnic on the lawn outside\nan open house during the interval. The party consists of Mr. and Mrs. Drew,\ntheir fed up daughter, and a guest who\nlater transpires just to be a friend of\nthe original guest who could not make it\nat the last minute. As the play progresses\nwe find out that Mrs, Drew was the\norganiser and the only person that really\nwanted to see the opera. For the other\nthree it is only a social drudgery that\nmust be borne out and it is remarkable\nhow little is ever said about the opera,\nas the parity are too involved with them-selves. It also transpires that Mr. Harper\n(the guest) is really a \"dirty old man\", who cannot come to terms with himself\nunless he regularly indulges in his hobby\nof making obscene phone calls and is\nmuch put off when the voice at the other\nend is not indignant but inviting. Miss\nDrew turns out to be a sexually \"liber-a ted girl\" Who prefers action to conversation and the silent Mr. Drew makes\nhis own revolutionary stand against his\nwife by refusing the cordon bleu picnic\nwith. champagne for the preferable\ncorned beef sandwich and pale ale. The overall effect is the humorous creation\nof a very realistic situation that we have\nall found ourselves in at one social function or another. The play was directed\nby Liane Auk in, who has managed to\nhandle the production with great sensitivity and nothing is overdone so the\nwhole effect is realistic rather than\nabsurd. Notable performances were\ngiven by Gillian Martell as the trendy\nmum and David Glover as the sex-c rayed guest.\nThe play was produced by Interaction,\nwho are a group experimenting in all forms of art and communications for\nuse at community level, and with this\nplay they have produced a very good\ndrama production that will appeal to\nlunchtime audiences, especially as there\nare no fixed prices, but you just pay\nwhat you want to.

Indeed,\nit was only the threat of\nstudent action last term\nwhich made the college\nfind some (small) subsidy,\nnot directly from tine UGC, to hold off 1 per cent or so of the re fe'c price in crease. Already, two days\nafter the Union decision,\nvague threats against the\nUnion are being put\nabout in an attempt to\nblackmail us . . . these\nthreats\u2014if they become\n'official'\u2014will only serve\nto show the college in the\nlight they deserve to be\nseen.\nHowever we do not normally expects threats of\nsabotage and the like to\ncome from any group of\nstudents\u2014however small\nand unrepresentative.\nThe Grants Action\nCommittee meeting called\non Thursday evening to\ndiscuss the implementation\nof Union policy was remarkably well attended.\nAbout50 people turned\nup, 35 or so of whom\n(who were new and in this\ncase unwelcome because of\ntheir unruly behaviour)\nwere from a group in the\nRS M commonly known as\nTHE Minesmen. This\ngroup which bears a close\nresemblance to those who\nsometimes come along to\nUnion meetings to heckle.\nfool-about, and challenge\nthe quorum if they can, did not come to help the\nimplementation of Union policy.\nThey came instead to try\nand sabotage Union policy,\nby proposing that its implementation be postponed to the last day of term!\nIf they had anything to\nexpress\u2014by speeches or voting\u2014on refectories and\ngrants in IC Union the\nplace to do it is in a Union meeting. They\nclaim they had their own meeting on at the same\ntime as ICU GM so could-n't come; well Mines meeting was called after\nICU \u2014 probably as a ploy\nto try and keep ICU in quo rate \u2014a ploy which\ndoubly failed. The fact is\nthey cannot have their\nMooney and eat it, IC Students must always\nwelcome discussion but\ncannot tolerate these silly\ndisrupt er s.IC Union policy is made by IC Union meetings\u2014no-one else.\nAfter the 35 gentlemen\n(?) of Mines etc. departed\nthe remaining people\u2014\nlargely those who had been elected to GAC plus\na few co-opted volunteers\n; \u2014met and organised pub-li city. Change (the President is being asked to\nmake it available), and leaflets, etc. 35 students\nwho appear to WANT??!! price increases in refectories cannot be permitted to\nsabotage the struggle\nwhich is in the interests of\nall IC students.\nRefutation\nIt has been suggested\nthat I write to explain why\nso many people turned up\nto the Grants Action Committee( GAC) last night,\nand why they adopted\nsuch an \"obstructive\" at ti tude.\nFirstly the Grants Ac tion Committee is a purely\nad hoc committee with no\nconstitution or rules drawn\nup. This lays any such\ncommittee open to control\nby definitive groups who\ncan manipulate to suit\ntheir own ideals.\nThe GAC had been\nmandated by the ICUn ion meeting to organise\nthe motion on refectories\ndealing with paying only\nthe old prices for food. To leave such vital matters in\nthe hands of a committee\nrun on the lines explained\nabove is lunacy.\nThe other question raised was whether Refectories have anything to do\nwith a Grants Campaign.\nIf the students at Imperial College feel that the refectories offer poor value\nfor money, or poor quality, or poor service then\nlet us stir up the refectories to establish the needs\nof Ithe customers.\nLet us not establish a Grants Campaign that is\nso all encompassing of\nevery grievance we have;\nthat it becomes so massive and unworkable as to\nblatantly fail before it\nshould leave the discussion\ntable.\nIt is my opinion that any\nGrants Campaign should\nbe a single forged policy\nARE WE\nUP-SIDE DOWN ?\nhy are we at IC (continued)\nWhat is the motivation that keeps\nus studying? money? status? lack of\njob? prestige? college's atmosphere?\nsecurity? If so, it is obvious that we\nshould feel bored and foolish. We should\nrather learn how to get money, a job,\netc., without having to learn and work\nwith all these difficult scientific and engineering subjects Motivation precedes\nall meaningful learning.\nBut if our \"motivation\" is either inertia or that we like Maths. Physics, etc..\nthen our motivations are academic and\nto some extent independent of the \"out-side world\", we are likely to feel therefore irresponsible, ordered about, arbitrarily graded, useless, etc., Motivation\nshould come from the \" real\" or \"out-side world\" and not from within the\ncollege or from (prepackaged cur ric u la. \"Phis applies unless we expect to\nsolve i problems of Ithe college only, regardless of anything else\u2014or unless we\nintend to declare ourselves irresponsible\n(i.e. someone else's tools) and. want to\ncor operate blindly to increase the al ready overgrown world's power for\nwhatever the \"future\" (i.e. the people\nholding power or the system's inertia)\nmay reserve for us.\nOne should be allowed to learn what\none is really motivated to learn, and not simply to acquire scarce \"know-ledge\" to mono polis e it and sell it as\nan expensive item or exchange it for\nstatus security, etc.; or not simply to be\nable to accept whatever kind of \"know-ledge\" is being pumped -in our heads\nafter a forced selection from among a number of pre packaged choices being\nput to us.\nLet me consider a subject like many\nothers, say Nuclear Reactor Physics; the\ntypical order of teaching is more or\nless:\n1\u2014The atom, -its nature, etc.\n2 \u2014 E=mc23 \u2014 Nuclear reactions, energy liberation,\netc.\n4 \u2014 The reactor, description, class if ica tion, etc.\n5 \u2014 Nuclear reactors engineering\n6\u2014 (Sometimes) Nuclear reaction economics. Separately, if one is lucky enough to\nfind out, one ca n join such courses as\n\"Environment and Man\"or Science 8c Society\", where (again with luck) someone may talk of the role of Nuclear reactors in some real situation such as\nsolving the energy crisis. In any case, by\nthe time we find out something about\nthe real problems, it is too late FOR US to decide whether or not the course is\nnot a prefabricated jerry\nbuilt failure. It should be\nmarketed as by anyone\nelse in industry does with\ntheir own products. The campaign should be carefully thought, hammered\ninto shape, extensively explained and advertised\nand then released with\nconsiderably more chance\nof success.\nP. Gee\nAt a union general meeting on Tuesday at the\nPolytechnic of North Lon don it was decided by approximately350 for to 100\nagainst to occupy the Ad ministration block in the\nHolloway precinct.\nThe students have been\nsleeping in overnight and manning the telephone exchange as well as preventing the Aministration staff\nfrom having access to all files and documents necessary to the running of the\ncollege.\nThe students are calling\nfor the resignation of the\nDirector of NLP, Terence\nMiller. He has fought since\nhis appointment against\nstudent representation on committees and the autonomy of the student union.\nA motion which amounted to a motion of no confidence in Miller was narrowly defeated at a Court\nof Governors meeting on the Monday before the\nUnion General Meeting by\n15 votes to 11.\nThe President, Terry\nPovey told me that the\noccupation would continue\nuntil Miller leaves. There\nwas no mention of the\nother problems that stud-IWR'^JLONDON\nAdmin, block Hollow ay Road. ents face in the original\nmotion.\nThe foyer of the Admin block in Holioway Road was plastered with posters\nexclaiming \" Miller man must go!\" referring to the\ndepiction of Miller as a student-bashing robot in vented by the Tories in the\ncurrent edition of the Poly\nhandbook.\nThe students manning\nthe telephone exchange\nand upstairs sitting on cushions >n the offices were\nall wearing badges saying\n\" Miller out\" which date\nfrom the first occupation\nto try and remove Miller\nfrom his post.\nThe files in the Admin had been checked over by\nJAI i? \u00abox\u00bb\u00a35\u00bb-W.\\\\\\\\\\\"\\ Millerman after defeat.\nthe occupying students\nand several had copies of\na letter from the University of Stirling implying\nthat Miller had applied for\nthe post of Principal and Vice-Chancellor there.\nLfcst Thursday meetings\nwere held in all the precincts ( NLP is spread over\nquite a large area) to discuss the occupation. The general feeling of the.se\nmeetings was one of confusion at why the executive, having tabled the original motion, appeared at\nthat stage to be trying to\nrun the occupation down.\nTerry Povey told me \"we are keeping the occupation small so that students don't become de moral is ed\" whereas the students in the precinct meetings appeared to feel that\nthe reverse should be the\ncase.\nPerhaps the main reason\nfor de moral is ation is summed up by a poster prominent in the entrance reading \"Let's inject some\npolitics into this occ up a tion\".\nHe has frozen their\nfunds for the third time,\nand the students are demanding that they be immediately unfrozen.\nuseful.\nResult: once one has already studied\nall that, the only possibility of feeling\nthat one is useful or needed, or of finding\na job, is by trying to solve any problem by applying the learned techniques\nof Nuclear Reactors. Obviously the\nmotivation to study in such a way may\nbe status, money, inertia, etc., but not\nthe wish to solve real problems such as\nenergy supplies, crisis, etc., simply because we didn't even know that such\nproblems existed sometimes.\nHow about trying the other way\naround? i.e. based on motivation, e.g.1 \u2014 Enersv requirements of present way\nof life\"\n2 \u2014 Alternatives\nIf the student still believes that more\nenergy is required and that it is the\nonly solution (or the best) . . . and\nfeels inclined to try or help to solve\nthe problem:\n3\n\u2014\u2014Energy production methods, consequences, costs, etc.\nIf the student still believes that Nuclear energy is a solution . . .\n4 \u2014 Nuclear Reactors, types, economy,\nsocial implications, ecological and\npolitical effects, possibilities, etc.\nAgain, if the student still . . .\n5 \u2014 Nuclear Reactor physics and engineering: research design, construction\nmaintenance, management, etc., job\nconditions, possibilities and scope,\npresent organisations, etc.\nIf the student...

Jowitit.\nPURPLE PATCH\nAt the Union General\nmeeting on Tuesday the\n16th October, two decisions were made, both of\nwhich bear a reasonable\namount of relevance to\nthe students in this college.\nThe first of these two\nmotions was that this\nUnion demands that the\ngoverning body remove\nthe 5 per cent increase\nwhich they have put on\nthe refectory prices, and\nmake good the loss on'the\nrefectories by sub sidi sing them from non refectory\nprofits. The second decision which was made was\nthat the Entertainments\ncommittee should be restricted to having three\nconcerts per term, unless\nthe S.C.AB. committee\nsanction another concert\nfor one reason or another.\nThis second decision\nenables the Entertainments committee to provide reasonable entertainment for the students of\nthis college, and at the\nsame time limits the number of concerts they are\nallowed to put on.\nAs far as the refectories\nmotion is concerned, the\nmeeting asked that the\nBoard of Governors remove the increase that\nthey suggested last term\nand that t lv sub sid is e the\nrefectories from non-re fec tory sources, thus breaking the U.G.C. ruling that\nthey should in no circumstances sub sid is e the re fec tories, but that the re fec, tones, should be totally\nself-financing. In order to\nimplement this policy and\nto force the board of\ngovernors to accept our\ndemands, we should set up\nchange tables in each of\nthe refectories, and from\nthese should provide people with the accurate\nchange which they require\nso that they can pay last\nyear's prices for the food\nwhich they are about to\neat. Thus the people\nwould look down last\nyear's price list, and then\noffer the old amount of\nmoney to the lady .behind\nthe cash desk, and refuse\nto pay her any more.\nWhen this motion was\nput forward, I spoke\nagainst it on similar lines\nto those which I put forward in FELIX' two\nweeks ago. During the\ndiscussions last term with\nthe refectories committee\nand also the Board of\nGovernors, we were told\nthat it was estimated that\nthe overall loss at the end\nof the session 1973/74\nwould be in the region of\n\u00a335,000 unless the prices\nin the refectories were in creased. Part of this increase could be offset by\nincluding the net surplus\nof around \u00a311,500 from\nthe Bars and the cellars\nthus leaving an overall\ndeficit of some \u00a323,500.\nThis could be offset by an\nincrease of 7\\ per cent,\nand would need a substantial amount of the refectories surplus to help\nthe finances out thus\nlimiting the amount of\nmuch needed decorating\nThe board of governors\ndecision was that the\nrefectory prices should be\nincreased by 5 per cent\n(i.e. to everyone including\nthe staff, and also those\npersons ordering dinners\netc.). This would then\nleave us to find some\nextra money from some-where, and it was decided\nto find this money from\nsome of the Rector's funds, this money to go\ntowards certain types of\nrc decoration of the refectory areas.\nAt a Grant's action\ncommittee (G.A.C.) last\nThursday evening, about\n30/40 R.S. M. students\nturned up to express their\ndisapproval of the decision\ntaken by the U.G. M.A.G.A. C. decision was\ntaken that the meeting\nshould adjourn and that it\nwould not reconvene until\nthe 14th December. It was\nalso decided that at the\nnext Union meeting, a Constitution of the G.A.C. should be drawn up, and\napproved, so that the\nG.A.C. would have some\nframework on which it\ncould work. ( N.B. The R.S. M. had a Union meeting on the same day as the\nI.C. Union meeting at\nwhich they decided that\nthe R.S. M. would not support the Rent strike. During the next couple of\nweeks both R.C.S. and\nalso C.&G, are having\nUnion meetings at which\nthey will both discuss the\nRent strike motion and\nalso the Refectories\nmotion. I would hope that\nas many people turn up to\nthe next I.C. Union meeting as will turn up to the\n-three C. C.U. Union meetings ! ! !\nThere are many other\nissues which I would like\nto discuss in this Patch,\nbut unfortunately neither\ntime nor space will permit\nthis. Some of these would\nbe:\u2014\n1 Departmental meetings with the Sabbatical\nofficers plus C. C.U. President.\n2 Profiles of certain of\nthe Union and College\nofficials in Felix..\n3 Better use of the P.A. System in College Block\nbefore U.G. M's.4 Restructuring of the\nU.G. M's by: \u2014\nLimiting the speeches to\nthree minutes; Guillotine\nof 75 minutes on the meet-ing; More motions at\nU.G. M's referring to our\nown problems; Decisions\non N.U.S. Policies to be\ntaken by the External\naffairs committee.\nIt was suggested that all\nof these ideas would be\ndiscussed at the next meeting of Council. They were\nproposed by a working\nparty on Publications and\npublicity last week.\nJust before I finish, I would like to inform\neveryone that at a Board\nof Governor's Finance and\nExecutive committee meeting on Friday of last\nweek, it was decided that\nthe Union should receive\nan extra \u00a35,000 on top of\nthe sub vent ion which they\nreceive at the moment. If\nanyone feels that the\nGoverning body are really\nagainst us then they could\npossibly try to explain this\none to me. (Maybe even\nsomeone will dream up\nthe idea of using this\nmoney to sub sid is e the\nrefectories rather than\nusing the money out of\nthe student's pockets!).\nNorm(a) Continue the present\nsituation where support\nand encouragement for\nlocally initiated rent\nstrikes is given, and (b) Call for a National Rent\nStrike.\n\" TREVOR PHILLIPS SOCIAL SECRET AR1E S CONFERENCE Those present (from\nQM C, Central Poly, North\nLondon Poly, Redbridge,\nCity, London and IC) told\nthe meeting what they had\non this term.\nThe meeting discussed\nproblems which had arisen\nout of agents, etc. No concrete decision was taken.\nAn all night event was\nproposed for 23rd November at City who had al ready booked two groups.\nQM C agreed to bring in\ntheir group for that night.\nIC agreed to sell tickets.\nWe also got the impression that other colleges\nwere rather jealous of our\nreputation in the field of\nentertainments.\nCity University have an\nidea for a large event at\nthe Agricultural Hall,\nwhich has not been used\nfor years and needs extensive renovation, for\nabout 17,000 people. Names suggested were\nJelferson Airplane and\nPink Floyd.\nThe meeting closed with\na resolution to meet again\nat Hatfield and put a motion on agencies and\nthe legality of contracts to\nNUS. Howniceto\nmeet someone who speaks\nyour language. When you meet our interviewer you'll usually find he's a specialist in your field\u2014whether it's chemistry,\nphysics, engineering, mathematics, economics or arts.\nThat means he can answer your questions from personal experience and discuss career opportunities from\nfirst-hand knowledge.\nThis year we shall be recruiting people for engineering,\nresearch and management services and keeping a particular eye open for people from all kinds of backgrounds\nwho want to have a marketing commercial career.\nWould you like to meet someone who speaks your\nlanguage ?\nThen ask your Appointments Service for details of how\nto apply.\nCentral Personnel Department,\nImperial Chemical Industries Limited,\nMillbank, London SWi P3J F.

PROPOSED BY\nICU GM AT LAST TUESDAY'S LG M,IC U pledged itself to a campaign round the\ncurrent 5 per cent increase in refectory\nprices that were imposed at the\nbeginning of this term.\nA motion proposed by Paul Watkins\nsuggesting a petition to be prepared\ncondemning the price increases and\nhanded in to the Rector at a large\ndemonstration. It also proposed that\nECU hold back a sum of money equal\nto the difference between the old and\nnew prices from payments made to the\ncollege. If this failed to stop the price\nrises an E.G. M. would be called to discuss different tactics.\nJock Veall argued against Watkins'\nmotion calling it a \"recipe for defeat\"\nand proposed an amendment asking for\nstudents to be issued with old price\nlists so that they would only pay the old\nprices. He called for a campaign of\nexplanation to publicise the increases\nand decisions taken to the staff and\nstudents.\nPete Lambert argued against the\namendment saying that it tied people to\nMooneys, whereas inflation was every-where, therefore one should call for\nsupplementary grants.\nThe amendment was passed 88-76 and\nthe amendment motion was passed over-w helm ingly. Norm Sayles, President ICU, argued\nagainst the amended motion saying that\nhis main points were those printed in his column in Felix 9th October edition.\nRecapped, these were that according to\nthe law, the College had no alternative\nand that at least the recommended\nincrease wasn't higher.\nThe full motion passed by the\nquo rate(!) Union Meeting is:-IC Union notes:\nI. The continued erosion of the\nstudent living standards caused by the\nlow grant and the high cost of food and\naccommodation.\n2 That the college has increased refectory prices by 5 per cent despite\nUnion representation on the Refectories\nCommittee-and the Governing Body.\nIC Union believes:\nThat the Governing Body should\ndefy the Government ( UGC) self balancing je gul at ions, and sub sid is e prices\nwith a view to forcing the Government\nto introduce refectory subsidies until the\nNUS demands on grants are fully\nsatisfied.\n1C Union recommends:\nThat in order to implement the\ndecision taken last term by aUG M to\nfreeze prices (i.e. to rescind the 5 per\ncent increase) and to stop further\nincreases, the Grants Action Committee\nand volunteers from this Union meeting\nwho should be co-opted on to the GAC shall organise:\u2014\n1. Tables to be set up in ALL refectories to give change, so that students are able to pay the correct money\nfor the old prices in the refectories.\n2. Old price lists to be distributed in the refectories.\n3. A campaign of explanation to the\nrefectory staff and students, to publicise\nthe issues at stake and the decisions\ntaken.\nAn entertainments motion was passed\nabolishing the motion passed at the last\nCouncil meeting of last year which\nrestricted the number of \"large groups\"\nper term to three.\nAn amendment was proposed by John\nLane increasing, the number of \"large\ngroups\" to four per term but was\nrejected as various Ents. personnel\npromised no return to the situation of\nlast year, despite the motion not giving\nan upper limit to the number of\n\"large groups\" per term.\nThe original Council motion was\npassed to ensure Ents. cater for a wider\nrange of tastes than just the groups\nscene, which is why this year we have\nfilms and folk groups as well as some\n\"large groups.\"\nVolunteers numbering about a dozen\nfrom the meeting were co-opted onto the\nG.A.C. and included Piers Corbyn (IC\nveteran) who was described by Tariq\nLolley as being \"the only one with any\nbrains on the GAC.\" The quorum Was then challenged\nsuccessfully and the meeting was closed\nbefore it could move on to the next\nitem: Chile.\nFIRE FIRE BROKE OUT in the lockers of\nthe Forbes Laboratory in Zoology last\n\u2022\nThursday afternoon.\nDiscovered by a technician who\nopened the door to the locker room and\nfound it full of thick smoke, the fire\ndestroyed a large number of plastic containers and incinerated the wood of the\nlockers.\nFour fire engines were rapidly outside\nBeit Hall summoned by the fire alarm\nincluding two with extending ladders.\nWater to extinguish the fire was pumped\nfrom a hydrant outside Botany in Prince\nConsort Road.\nThe Felix editor writes: T was in the\nButtery at the time the alarms went off,\nassuming them to be a routine practice\nI strolled outside to find smoke billowing out of the third floor windows of\nZoology. Upstairs the Forbes lab was\nfull of dense acrid smoke which immediately made your eyes water. People\nwere attempting to put the fire out with\nhand extinguishers but the fire appeared\nto have too great a hold.\n'The firemen were quickly on the\nscene with a hose hauled up from Beit\nquad. A few lucky ones had breathing\napparatus\u2014the others would only be\nable to stand it in the lab for a few\nminutes before dashing out eyes stream-ing, gasping and coughing.\nAfter about five minutes the smoke\nstarted to subside, the windows were\nopened to disperse what remained of the\nchoking fumes and we could see the\nextent of the damage.\nWater and foam covered the floor and\nwalls of the locker room, two windows\nhad been broken to let the smoke out,\nburn marks and melted plastic were\neverywhere. Inside the locker room the\nheat was still intense\u2014so much so that\nthe translucent plastic coyer on a fluorescent roof light had melted and distorted out of all recognition. The fire\nitself was by all appearances centred at\na low level in the lockers'.\nThe cause of the fire has not been\ndiscovered and according to Norm\nSayles arson is not being discounted as\na possibility.\n\n"

They have set up seven costing committees to thrash out the costs of the\nNUS claims. These are as follows:\n! 1. On Discretionary Awards and i their Abolition.\nThis is a hopeful sign, as it is a crack in the DES' s wall of resistance\nre abolition of discretionary awards.\nThe NUS has suggested that costing\n-1\nbe considered im (three \"tiers\" o'r groups:\ni. mandatory awards for H ND or\ndegree-equivalents.\nii. mandatory awards to all 18 +\nstudents.\nHi. mandatory awards to all 16 +\nstudents.\nAs regards iii. this would include the\nvast majority of Technical College\nstudents. The majority of students\nbetween 16 and 18 are not in schools\nbut in Techs and FE colleges (many\npeople forget this).\nThe DES does not appear to be interested in i the abolition of the Discretionary Award Scheme. However,\n\u2022 it will be an advantage in presenting\nthe NUS case for abolition if we have\na real figure for the cost.\nLegislation Will be needed to amend\nthe 1944 Education Act. There will\ndefinitely be an amendment next\nyear, Ito provide a mandatory grant\nfor the Dip. HE( as proposed in the\nGovt. White i Paper). It is hoped that\nif any legislative action is taken over\ndiscretionary awards, it will be taken\nat this time.\nAnother encouraging action on this\nfront is that LEA's will be able to\nrecover 90% of i their expenditure on\nmandatory awards from 1st April,1973. In theory, they can now be\nmore generous with discretionary\nawards. (Hitherto, i they could only\nre coyer60% of their expenditure).\n2. The Cost of abolition of discrimination against married women students\nhas been established as\n(a) \u00a3l^m. if i they all received the\n\"at-home\" grant (about \u00a3390).\n(b), \u00a33m. if they all received the\n\"away-from-home\" grant (\u00a3520).\nLinked to this is the question of de-pendants' allowances. The DES policy (Which was laid (before the\nHouse of Commons two days before the recess) lis that \u00a3250 per week\nshould be paid for i the academic year,\nand during the vacations, the claimant has to go to the DHS S Hike anyone else.\nThis amounts to \u00a34.81 per week in term-time.\nA campaign around this issue is Ito\nbe run, within the Grants Campaign,\n\u2022to involve women in local Colleges,\nit is hoped that there will be a meet-ling between NUS Exec, and Union\nWelfare Officers shortly.\n3. A new award system for students\nstudying abroad.\nStudents studying in foreign countries often run out of money before\nthe end of their courses because of\ncurrency exchange fluctuations and\nhigh cost of living in some foreign\ncountries.\nThe DES wants an administratively\nSimple system; perhaps banding together several countries under a particular rate of grant. The DES has\nprovided some cost-of-living figures\nfor some foreign countries, particularly EEC countries. The NUS position is that no student abroad should\nreceive less than the London grant,\nand -that it should be paid in one\nof two ways:\n(a) the grant should be paid termly,\nwith adjustment for exchange\nfluctuations and high cost of\nliving in same foreign countries,\n(b) the grant should be paid in the\nappropriate foreign currency at\nthe start of the academic year.\nAs for overseas students, there is\nlittle chance, it seems, of abolishing\nthe 3-year residence qualification.\nThe only movement here is the possibility of students living in the EEC may receive mandatory awards.\niv. Abolition of the Means Test.\nVarious approximate figures of the\ncost have appeared over 'the past\nfive years; they range from \u00a36m.( NUS) to \u00a320m.( DES). NU)S has/\npointed out that withdrawal of tax\nallowance for parents with children\nreceiving grants would partly offset\nthe cost of abolition. The DES has\nbeen \"co-operative\" in these negotiations, but the Inland Revenue Service has been distinctly strop py, and\nrefuses to give up the relevant figures to N US.v. Giving cash grants to College of\nEd. students\nThe DES instituted a Pilolt Scheme\nin ten Colleges a few years back, but\nappears to have gone off the idea\nnow. They are now saying that they\nhave commitment to introduce cash\ngrants and want to introduce subsidies to cover the losses incurred in College of Education Halls and cat-e ring. The NUS Executive therefore\nconsiders it unwise to continue linking this claim to the Pilot Scheme\nand plan to raise i the question in\ngeneral negotiations.\nvi. Raising the main rate.\nThis is i the most difficult costing, in-clu ding, as it does, the assessment of\nthe notional element for board and\nlodging. Hitherto this has been taken\nas the average of hall rents. This is,\nof course, misleading, because hall\nrents are largely dependent on sub-si dies,\" hidden\" or otherwise. The\nwithdrawal of which may lead to\nsudden rises. Furthermore, as regards \"digs\", i the retail price index\nonly measures the cost of unfurnished accommodation, the cost of\nwhich rises much more slowly than\nthe cost of furnished accommodation.\nHence, the cost of all student accommodation is to be taken into account\nin these present negotiations.\nEquipment grants are also being discussed in this context.\nvii. Students on long courses.\nThis includes health students, and\npostgraduates.\nHealth students may be studying for\n44 to 48 weeks every year, but only\nreceive the notional element for\nboard and lodging for the extra\nweeks (14-18 weeks). These students\nhave no opportunity to work during\nthe holidays, (only 4 weeks). The\nNUS case is that they should receive\nthe full grant for all 44-48 weeks.\nParamedical students (manual hospital workers, etc.) are included in the section (i), as they receive discretionary awards.\nFt appears that no-one in the DES knows how the PG grant is assessed;\nthis may be one reason why there\nhas been no action from them on it!\nThe NUS has suggested that it be\nassessed in one of two ways:\ni. as for other long-course students,\n(ii) part or whole of a recent g radu ate's salary; 7 5 % has been raised\nas a figure.\nThe most significant point, however,\nlis that NUS has little or no policy\non the postgraduate grant. Any ideas?\nThere are a few other areas which\nhave been discussed:\n(a) Field Trips\nThe NUS has taken the line that in\nterm-time, Students should receive\na certain amount of money to de-fray, extra costs incurred by a field\ntrip. During vacations all the elements in the grant should be included in the sum given, instead of just\nboard, lodgings and travel.\nNote: The UGC gives each institution a certain amount to sub-sid is e field trips, from a central pool. It is likely that IC is one College that benefits\nfrom this scheme,\n(ib) The Triennial Review\nOne of NUS's demands to go to the\n1973-74 Triennial Review is the\nabolition of the Triennial Review,\nThis, NUS feels, should be replaced\nby an annual review of student fin-ance. A questionnaire to be sent out\nto 10 institutions on a proposed pilot\nfor the NUS scheme is to be prepared by the DES.(c) Delay in Ithe payment of grants.\nThis year it was caused by LEA's 'being forced to re calculate the grant\nlevels because of the changes in the\nmeans test. NUS hopes to speed up\nthe Triennial Review this year so\nthat it doesn't drag on into the sum-mer, and delay the payment of the\n(higher?) grant.\nThe Campaign\nNone of the DES NUS negotiations\ncarry any commitments from either side.\nAt the end of the negotiations, the political decisions Will be taken in DE STreasury infighting. NUS Executive believes that it is at this point that the\nCampaign must be strongest\u2014we must\napply our political weight to produce\nthe right decision; hence the campaign\nshould build up to the Review, and if\nnecessary, carry on beyond it.\nSteve Parry spoke on the campaign.\nHe pointed out Itihat the campaign must\nbe carried out to 'back the negotiations\nand in conjunction With Trade Unions\nand other groups on low and fixed in-comes, e.g. pensioners and claimants.\nAfter Margate, activity should be\nbuilt up on an area basis during the\nsecond term. Action should be taken\naround LEA meetings, etc., and culminate in a massive demonstration at a significant juncture in the Triennial Review.\nk is hoped that areas will commence\naction on students rights in conjunction\nWiith the Grants campaign.\nIn IC\nWe would hope to do several things\nthis term:\ni. Inform students, particularly fresh-ers, about the grants campaign.\nii. Raise the level of consciousness\nenough to provide i the semblance of\na mass mobil is ation in the College.\niii. Pave the way for an effective rent\nstrike next term, a crucial period.\niv. Partake in the area campaign, and provide some effective assistance to\nsmaller Colleges in the area.\nThe major argument on Saturday was\nthe posing of national vs. local actions.\nMy feeling is that any -action, local\nor national depends on the effectiveness\nof local student union officers. It is up\nto the Union Executive to organise an effective campaign, and Ito mobil is e sfu*\ndents to enter the campaign. It is often\nvery useful to capital is e on feeling over\nlocal issues, e.g. refectory prices, and use\nthese to show the nature of the grants\nsituation ito Government Economic policy and the affect it has on students and\nothers on low and fixed incomes.\nI hope that there Will be some campaigning with outside groups:\ni. Trades Union via Hammersmith\nCouncil.\nii. Pensioners; how about some cam-'\npai g ning for them?\niii. Claimants.\niv. Tenants' Associations.\nDates to Remember:\u2014\nOctober 24th or 25th: Area action.\nProposed: brief rally, then march to and picket of LEA Action on discretionary\nawards.\nNovember 7ih: National Rally.\nNovember 14th: Work in( and PrirH\nces s Anne's wedding day).\nContinued on page 4\nCommittee of Vice-Chancellors\nand Principals show support for\nhigher grants\n... but words don t pay hills\nAt its meeting this morning the Vice-Chanceilors' Committee discussed the issue of student grants against the background of the review currently being conducted by the Department of Education and\nScience to determine the grant levels for the three years commencing\nnext autumn.\nIt has been the declared policy of successive Governrrents over\nmany years since the Anderson Committee reported, that subject to\na parental means test, grants should be available to cover the reasonable basic maintenance costs of undergraduate students. This is the\nAnderson principle. But in recent years, Governments have begun\nto threaten this principle by fixing grants which fall short of basic\nliving costs.\nUniversities are hit by\nthe decreasing value in\nstudent grants in two ways.\nIn the first place, students\nought to have the basic\nmeans to support themselves so that their studies\nare not adversely affected.\nIn the second place, if universities are to continue to\ntry to house students and\nprevent a crisis in accommodation, they must be\nable to fix rents which\nmeet the cost of providing\naccommodation which now has to be financed\nprincipally through loans\nraised on the open money\nmarket. Equally students\nliving in lodgings must be\nable to pay rent at i the going rate.\nThe Committee's concern about student grants\nhas become more acute\nover the last two years.\nWhen the DES announced\npress release\nthe levels that were to\napply for the three academic years 1971-74, the\nCommittee said that inadequate grants were inconsistent with the Government's policy which\nrequired universities to\nmake economic charges\nfor board and lodging.\nOver the past year the\nstudents' grievances\nagainst the Government\nabout the declining purchasing power of their\ngrant took the form of\nrent strikes and protest\naction directed against\nuniversities. Although the\nuniversities sym pathis ed wil th the students' diff i cul ties, they were bound to\ntell their students that they\ncould not provide wide-ranging subsidies from\nfunds voted by Parliament\nfor the primary purposes\nof teaching and research.\nStudent protest action directed against universities is\nmisconceived. It wastes\ntime and money on conflicts which are not created\nby universities and which\nare not in their power to\nresolve.\nThe DES review of student grants for the three\nyears from nc::t September is now under way. The Committee believes that\nthe Anderson principle is\nat stake. It is essential that\nstudent grants should be\nproperly assessed, fixed initially at realistic levels\nand between reviews supplemented annually to\ntake account of changing\nprices. The Committee has\nalready made its general\nViews known to Ministers\nand proposes to make further representations as the\nreview proceeds.\n\n"

PHOENIX ARISEN\n. Friends, if you perused the first edition of our esteemed college journal,\nFelix, this term you may have seen\nmention of a magazine, by name\nPHOENIX. Even if this is not so, do\nnot despair, for I shall briefly recap\nand expound here and now.\nPHOENIX is a magazine steeped in history. It was founded n years ago\nby no lesser a person than H.G. WELLS, and has since been through\ninnumerable hands. As of course, is to\nbe expected the magazine has greatly\nevolved in both form and content;\nthough some might say that the changes\nhave been by revolution not evolution.\nWell, friends, now is your chance to\nacquaint yourselves with and even buy\nthis famed magazine as last year's rather\ndelayed (to be regarded as a proof the\nadage that 'time and printers wait for\nno editors, be they Felix or PHOENIX') edition is now on sale. This excellent\nmagazine contains poems and prose and\nartwork (ate.) hot from the fer v our ed minds of I.C.'s literary giants (who happen to be posing at this moment as uncultured science and engineering stu-dents).\nThe only catch in this superb and\nunique offer is that i the magazine costs\n20p. Now don't stop reading! Come on,\nput your minces closer to this article\nand have a good butchers! This un fortunate accident is no fault of the\neditors but is our lot deemed unto us\nby those above, and is specially designed\nto protect your scant dues paid into the\nUnion.\nWell a further evolution has occurred\nand I am editor\u2014an editor, I might add,\nwith new ideas for the next edition of\nPHOENIX. However Iam also an editor Who is slightly lacking in staff, owing\nto the almost total third-year monopoly\nof last year's magazine. So I am looking\nfor some fresh energetic minds who are\ninterested enough to drop me their\nnames\u2014you don't have to be Shelleys\nor Cervantes', just ordinary students\nwho can offer ideas and moral support\nto your wilting editor as he fights\nagainst the apathy of I.C. And now we are at the heart of the\nmatter, apathy\u2014or as I prefer, ignorance and diffidence. In my conversations with many people across the college I found that it was not that they\n'could not be bothered' to contribute\narticles, but that they had never heard\nof PHOENIX or had never seen one\nand so did not know what sort of\nmaterial was wanted. So I shall tell you\nnow that we want: POEMS, PROSE( fiction and non-fiction), ARTWORK, CARTOONS \u2014 in fact almost ANYTHING. NOw there are 4000 odd students at I.C., and I want every one of\nyou to put pen/brush/eh are o al/ etc. to\npaper and create something for the next\nPHOENIX. There is excellent potential\nat I.C. to produce an outstanding maga-zine; but the editing board cannot do\nthis on their own \u2014 PHOENIX is YOUR magazine and stands or falls by YOUR contributions. So don't be shy, send in\nyour piece now! Iam going to start\nearly to build up a good magazine, and\nI need YOUR help.\nSo if you are interested in helping\nbehind the scenes or wish to be the\nstar and have your name printed under\nevery fruit of your fertile spawn of\ngenius, send word (or composition) to\nme \u2014 STEVE HERMAN either (care-fully labelled) via the Felix Office (3rd floor, Union) or Via the Physics letter\nrack.\nMany Thanks,\nKEEP ON WRITING!! and BUY PHOENIX!!

However, for it's kind the musical\ncontent is above average, and the arrangement showed some forethought,\nthe tune's very catchy (of course!) and\ncould only be described as the commer-cia list of pop.\nDefinitely a new departure for\nYoungers \u2014 transferring the image of\n'Tartan' from the drink of the burly\nHighlander ito that of the ' Top of the\nPops' set.\nIn short, worth a play if you get it\nfree.\nD.

Jub.'*.,\n\u00bbne of those interesting stories\nAfter last week's report you probably gained the impression that a large\nfield was expected at the 2nd UL Cross\nCountry Trial. In fact there were only\n36 runners: maybe the others were put\noff by the previous muddle (or perhaps\nthey don't exist). The fact that UL were\nWithout any organisation was again the\ncause of some dashing about by some\npeople and some standing around in the cold by others. First of all, it was\ngenerally decided that we'd do the 5\nrather than the 6 mile course, and we\nwere about to start when it wasn'ta good\nidea because the course wasn't marked\nand half the people wouldn't know the\nway. Now, by coincidence, there were\ntwo other i races at Parliament Hill that\nafternoon and we somehow co-opted\none of their courses which was well\nmarked. Someone then went round the\ncourse so he could describe it. Past gems\nof course-description here have included\n'Go round the tree that isn't there\",\nand \"It's the same as the 1938 National\ncourse\"; this year it was \" Don't go\nround the Extension,\" whatever that\nwas.\nSo, somewhat colder, we set off and\nfound our way round two laps totalling\nabout 5J miles. Richard Garnett and\nRob Allinson were tenth equal in about\n32 minutes, followed by Ian Ellis (12th), Kaliray (14th) and Dave West (15th). The rest of us were well spread over the\nremaining finishers with Pad bringing\nup the rear despite a6 minute improvement over a similar distance last week.\nUnfortunately Neil Boag arrived too late\nto run having been trapped by BRin a locked up station.\nAfter the race we set off for the station via Greasy Joe's Tea and Chess\nEmporium, and, after waiting for a lift\nfor some time Ian Ellis decided (dis-playing typical Cross Country Club lead-er ship) to open the gates of one of the\nlifts already waiting at the top landing,\nand we and other people got in. Upon all this activity a nail man appeared and\noffered his estimate of how long we'd have to wait for the lift to move, so\neverybody got out again.\nOn Wednesday we went to Richmond\nPark. There's not much to say about\nthis because nothing went wrong. We\nwent round our course (each at his own\npace: and many and varied these were),\nand arrived back in time to play on the\nswings while waiting for the coach.\nNext week Inquests on the UC Relay\nand the League Race, and Ian Isherwood's explanation of why he's still not\nrunning.\nDJ. HOCKEY CLUB!\nA rather depleted 2nd XI played the\nfirst match of the season away against\nl.'.C.2 nds on Saturday. After recruiting players from 1st and 3rd X Is( thanks to Andrew, Jerry and Richard)\nten individuals invaded 5th Kensington\nunderground complete with sticks and\nother assorted weapons, so beginning\nthe marathon journey to Shenley.\nThe game got underway with some\nintelligent and positive play by all members of the team. U.C. were contained in i their own half, and although\nshots at goal were not in abundance, a well taken goal, from deep in the ' D', struck by Mike Hatcher gave us a deserved 1-0 lead at half time. After the\nbreak, however, the team seemed to fall\napart with U.C. forwards finding ample\nroom to score three goals Ito seal our\nfate.\nAfter the match U.C. showed a marked lack of hospitality, and\u2014more\nimportant\u2014a marked lack of jugs. So it\nwas a generally pd off team that\nreturned to I.C.A word of encouragement to fresh-ers !to show up on Saturdays (at 1.00\np.m. in the union) if you want your talents to be recognised.

Matcher. J. Wong, G. Robinson.\nJUDO CLUB\nI.C.'s Judo Club only came back into\nexistence last year\u2014so naturally, it is\nstill a very new club, and continuously\nundergoing the process of change and\ndevelopment, eventually we hope into a very prominent and successful club.\nWe have had many of last year's club members return to form a nucleus\nfor this year. We have also had over\n28 newcomers with a range of experience\nfrom white belt to black. As at i the beginning of any year, there is also a lot\nof interest from prospective beginners\nwho may well join on having had an introduction to judo.\nDuring this first term we hope to\norganise several demonstration/friendly\ncompetition events with other college\nclubs in UL U, to which anybody interested\u2014if only to watch\u2014is very we l come. Then after Christmas things will\nbecome more serious as we enter 'full-blooded' competitions (not too much\nblood we hope!), and with a little luck\ntake off some trophies.\nWe will be very pleased at any time\nto welcome new members (from begin\nner s to black belts).

Imperial, under\nthe delusion of playing Brunei 1st XI, played within themselves in the first\nhalf and at half time the score was 2-0.\nMick Dovvnes then informed us we were\nplaying Brunei 2nd XI and we composed\nourselves accordingly and ran out winners 7-0. The scorers were G. Popple\n(3 + 1 jus), M. Downes (2) and K. Ross (2).\nWednesday evening was also Pie and\nMash night.

He led in great style, leading\nthe Mines contingent to victory, and was\naccorded an exclusive interview on\nSTOIC. On a 'per capita' basis Mines once\ncollected more than either of the other\nconstituent Colleges, and a total of \u00a3420\nwas collected.\nThe hard work and fun realised in this event can i be judged by the number\nof students hobbling around over the\nweekend.\nNo arrests were made, a good start.\nWin kers at work MORPHY DAY OCTOBER 24th In 1920 Arthur Morphy presented\nImperial College with a cup to be rowed\nfor by the Constituent Colleges. The\nrace was started from s'take boats and\nraced in Eights from Hammersmith\nBridge to the University Stone at Putney\nBridge.\nCompetition for the Morphy first\neights was so strong that in 1945 Colonel\nLowry, then the secretary of the College, introduced the Lowry Cup for\nsecond eights. It is a regrettable fact\nthat puny C and G have managed to\ncrawl home first 39 times, Mines 8\ntimes and RCS, being gentlemen, have\nconsiderately exerted their authority a mere 6 times.\nThis year C&G have fielded an eight\nwhich is probably the fastest in Britain.\nThey have six international oarsmen and\nthe rest are made'up of national cham-pions. The RCS crew have most of\nthe IC first eight, and Mines are also\ncompeting.\nAfter the second war the Stakeboat\nstarts were replaced by free starts and\nthen in1960 the course was shortened\nto 2,500 metres from Harrods Depository to the University Stone.\nPaSt tow path battles include a mock\nfuneral with coffins carried by C&G and RCS, complete with police escort\nacross Putney Bridge and down the Embankment to IC Boathouse. City and\nGuilds have now ordered their usual\nfive hundredweight of flour, but it is\nrumoured that Mines, with an unusual\ndisplay of intelligence, have phoned up\nthe company and diverted the cargo into\ntheir own coffers, at CG's expense.\nDid you know that RCS has won the\ntowpath battle twenty-six times (once\nwith the help of Mines) and the score\nstands the same with C&G? Come on\nRCS( I try not to be biased), we need\nthat Morphy Day Mascot, and for the\nMiners, in case you'd forgotten, it's a sawn-off oar. /\n\n"
