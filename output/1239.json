    "content": "this week\nEditorial\nTo say my joy knew no bounds\nwould be such an understatement that it would equivocate\nto saying that the Pacific\nOcean is quite a large lake.\nI have been reliably\ninformed that complaining of\nmy work load is not done, and\nthat if I do it, I should just\ndelete it instantly, and as\nsuch, I'm not going to.\nHowever, I suspect that you\ncan't help but notice the\nrather diminutive nature of\nFelix this week, and I feel that\nthis requires an explanation.\nYou see, this week all my sub\neditors have got something\nbetter to do than write, there\nis no news, not to mention the\nfinancial crisis, and of course\nthe alternative prospectus,\nwhich is due at the printer's Monday morning. As well as\nthe gig that I have on Monday,\nfor which I know nothing, but\nthat's my problem, so I shouldn't really complain.\nSo don't ask, basically.\nThis weekend, on the other\nhand, is going to be a whole\nbundle of laughs. Don't forget\nthat there is the summer ball,\nwhich I shall certainly be\nattending, and on top of that,\nI'm going to be having a lot of\nhouse guests, which would be\nan incredibly good thing apart\nfrom the fact that they're\ngoing to be sitting around (or\npossibly sleeping) in my\nroom, while I am forced to\nwork. I do love it when my\nlove life takes a massive turn\nfor the better only to be\nthwarted by the publishing\nbusiness, if one can put it that\nway.\nI felt a large disturbance in\nthe force on Monday, and I must admit that it has left me\nlargely shaken since then. Not\nquite, admittedly, as shaken\nas when I tried some Blue\nWKD the other day: that left\nme feeling like someone was\nslowly twisting my brain\naround inside my skull. But\nyes, disturbance in the force it\nwas, and since then I have\nhad the feeling that some bad\nthings are going to happen.\nAnd since then some bad\nthings have happened, but I can't really believe they warranted quite the feeling of\ndread that washed over me.\nMaybe I'm just paranoid, but I suspect that the next editorial\nI write will possibly be the\nmost surreal of the year.\nI have been looking back at\nthe final issue editorials of\neditors in the past, and have\nnoticed that many of them are\nalong the lines of 'Well it's the\nend of an era, and I'm off to\nget a job, etc' This isn't quite\nthe same with me, because I 'll\nbe here next year, so I'm not\nfeeling even remotely no stal gic, but for all those final year\nstudents out there: well done\nand good luck. I, however, am\nstaying here in Beit Quad\nwhere it's warm and comfort-able. Having said that, when\nmy time to leave does come,\nI 'll probably be a gibbering\nwreck when I finally emerge\nblinking and gasping from the\nbasements like a butterfly\nafter its long hibernation\nthrough the winter months,\nand you can all laugh at me\nthen.\nSo to conclude (since I have no advertising space,\nand promised that I would\nput this ad in), go to the\nTheatre Of Science talk on\nTuesday in Lecture Theatre 1\nin the Physics Dept. See\nStudent Activities in the\ndiary for more information\nAnd finally: Go on, you!\nThis\nWeek\nFriday Weekend\nUnion\nEvents\nDolly Mixtures\nCheese in abundance,\nbut also plenty of the\nother staples of trance\nand house as well, packaged together in all their\nsugary goodness.\n8pm Summer Ball\nWhat do you mean\nyou're not going?

In addition, there will also be\na 'Test Your Strength' machine and candy\nfloss will be available to add to the fairground atmosphere of the event.\nThe event's organisers have been able\nto negotiate discounts with various outfitters enabling those wishing to go to the\nevent to hire suitable attire at bargain\nprices; these include several stores within\nthe Moss Bros group, and Pegaso on\nKensington High Street.\nIf you have still not purchased your ticket for this once-in-a year event, then they\nare available from the branch of\nWaterstone's on campus, the Union recep-tion, and also in the JCR this lunchtime.\nMore information about this year's event is available from the website\nwww.su.ic.ac.uk/summer ball. John S Oil Be Damned\nFirefighters were called to\nImperial's Charing Cross campus in the early hours of Bank\nHoliday Tuesday after an electrical fault caused a generator\nto spill diesel oil within the\nhospital.\nThe spillage came about\nafter a fuse blew in the electrical circuitry of an unoccupied\nlab block. This caused a level\nswitch to malfunction which\nresulted in its failure to regulate the amount of diesel being\ndrawn into the generator.\nSecurity officers at the campus\nsmelt the overflowing oil and\nalerted the fire brigade, who\nwere able to shut down the\npower to the block on their\narrival, before co-ordinating a clear-up operation. An on-site\nengineer was able to repair the\nelectrical fault.\nA spokesperson for the\nCharing Cross campus - one of\nthe sites of the College's School\nof Medicine - told Felix that\nalthough early reports had\nclaimed that ten thousand\nlitres of diesel oil had escaped,\nthe spillage was in fact only a minor one and that the hos pi tal's generators are tested regularly to ensure that they are in\ngood working order. They\nadded that no-one had been\nharmed or placed in danger by\nthe incident and that the\nspillage had been cleared up\nwithout any detrimental effect\non either the hospital's patients or their care.\nJohnS\nimperial College r Llnion Choir\nFriday14 th June Spm Holy Trinity Church, Prince Consort Road, Ticket sE7/E3.
