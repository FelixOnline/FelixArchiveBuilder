    "content": "FELIX FRIDAY 22ND NOVEMBER COLUMNS11 Time for a change this week, I think.\nYou must be a shade fatigued by the\nrelentless 'analysis' of Sherfield's activities, entirely justified as it is, of\ncourse. As for Ian Caldwell, even I am almost tinged with guilt, particularly since he is finally starting to act\nwith financial prudence over the sale\nof Boathouse rubble to the alumni.\nMagnificent idea. If it worked for\nsome hideous lump of concrete in\nGermany, think what we can get for\nlovely Putney bricks. I shall also\nresist the urge to mention a recent\nincident in the Student fees office,\nwhere a friend of mine was kept\nwaiting for over five minutes, despite\nthe presence of six staff when he\nentered the room, finally to be served\nby some chap whose essential work\non a computer consisted of playing\nChess. Perhaps Mike Hansen would\ncare to take up the running on this\none.\nNo, this week it's Europe.\nDie-hard followers of this column\nwill know that I am not the most\nardent fan of the European Union. I have long held the belief that the\nSingle Market, which allies more\nclosely with Britain's long standing\nadherence to free trade than with\nmany of our continental partners, is\nvery important. My problem is with\nthe inexorable\ndrive to harmon- ^ | JJ*| 0\nis ation, integration and federal-ism. As the days\ngo by, I can find\nmore and more\nreasons why\nmonetary union\nis fatally flawed.\nAside from the\npathetic point\nabout tourists\navoiding currency commission,\nnot one watertight argument\nfor it appears to\nhave been put. VOICQ OI\nThe notion that\neconomies as disparate as Germany\nand Portugal can be 'aligned' and\n'converge', to be run under a single\neconomic policy and interest rates is\nplainly absurd, a point which the\npeoples of Europe, particularly\nGermany are beginning to see. How\non earth can the Deutschmark retain\nall its value after 1999 if it becomes\nthe Euro merged with currencies it\nhas historically\nJD G K CF been stronger\nthan?\nBritain, quite\nrightly, is not taking all this at face\nvalue. We are\nquite prepared to\npick and choose\npolicies that are\nbeneficial to\nBritain, since we\nclearly don't share\nthe FrancoGerman 'dream'\nof a united\nEurope. The\nrecent working\nweek fiasco is a perfect example. We secure an opt\nout from the Social Chapter, which\ncontains the legislation, and so the\nEuropean Commission decide to call\nit Health and Safety, which we can't Reason\nveto. This shows that the system is\nnot working. Individual concerns are\nbeing swept away in the name of the\ngreater good. Subsequently the only\nway that our voice can be heard is by\nscuppering major summits, which\ndoes little for the dignity of the EU.\nHowever, desperate situations call\nfor desperate remedies. So much of\nrecent EU policy is blatantly against\nBritain's best interests- fishing, agri-culture, employment, transport and\nso on. It is time to renegotiate our\nposition in the club, otherwise we\nwill arrive at a situation where public\nopinion will jeo pardi se the benefits\nby calling for our exit, which is not\nas crazy as it sounds.\nFinally, can I remind the Hockey\nThirds that 'funny names' in your\nreports were funny and original at\nroughly the sametime that Little and\nLarge were. The sports team, devious\nswines that they are, only leave them\nin to make you look silly, so don't do it. 'Indian Carpet catalogue'\nindeed. But what happened to 'Swiss\nCottage'?\nin the course of du t yAt this point I must take a brief break\nfrom my academic ex tempo rising to\nalert everyone that a great, perverse\nand repugnant injustice may soon be\nbrought upon us all. For those of\nyou who have not kept up with current affairs, certain people are\nattempting to ban the release of the\nfilm 'Crash'. Crash was made by\nDavid Cronenbourg, possibly the\nmost vital, creative film maker alive\ntoday. It was based on the book by\nJ.G. Ballard, the most profound,\nprophetic writer of the late twentieth\ncentury. The book tells the tale of\ncertain normal individuals, and the\nmanner in which their lives were\nirrevocably changed by their\ninvolvement in serious car crashes.\nAlthough I have not seen it (and possibly never will) there is no doubt in\nmy mind that this film is one of the\nmost beautiful, powerful and disturbing ever made. And yet,\nphilistines such as Virginia\nBottomley are attempting to prevent\nthe public seeing it. Their claim: that\nit is sick, pornographic and brutal.\nThey are correct of course, it is\nsick, it is depraved, it is undeniably\nbrutal and possibly pornographic,\nbut that is no reason for not showing\nit - it is also a great, important work\nof art. Films such as Die Hard and\nEraser are far more brutal and violent than this, and far lesser works of\nart, and they are shown and lauded at\nevery turn. The crowds love them,\nthey cheer at every decapitation and\nmutilation. So, what is the problem\nwith Crash? It is different because it\nis not enjoyable, it is not pleasant, it\nis wholly foul. This is because it\nexposes parts of the human psyche\nwhich the politicians prefer to brush\nunder the carpet. They do not want\nto admit that humans might be by\ntheir very nature cruel, sexual\nbeings, excited by violent, senseless\ndeath. They prefer to imagine that\npeople can, and will, fit into the\nshroud of artificial normality that\nthey have cast.\nIt is in a similar manner that certain psychological experiments\n(Milgram's obedience experiment\nand Zimbardo's prison simulation; I will not go into details here but they\nare described in any standard psychology textbook should you wish to\nlook them up) have been branded\nunethical. The ostensible reasons for\nthis are weak and largely irrelevant;\nthe real reason for this branding was\nsimply because they revealed the\ntrue brutality of the human mind.\nSo I say that Crash must be\nshown. In fact it should be shown\neverywhere; in cinemas, on te levi sion, in supermarkets, on giant public screens on street corners. It\nshould be compulsory viewing at\nschools, it should be an essential part\nof every curriculum. Not just\nbecause it is an incredible work of j art, but because it could prove to be\nthe most revealing film ever made.\nTHE WEEKLY POEM supplied by PoetIC\nNIGHT TO DAY\nSinking into this murky depression,\nno control of one's powers\nand powers seem to be lost\nBliss and happiness arriving abruptly\nthen going away quietly\nin a simmering twilight\nCovers the ears\nmaking a sign of understanding...\ncars passing by seeking the buzz...\nIt's night again.\nAll the zeros join together\nto make for a new start,\nthat won't begin,\nNil\nYou haven't got a stomach for this.\nIt's all acting in a world that you dream upon.\nJust one slight breath changes it\nFrom night to day\nDawn.\nImpatience and ruin\nWaking up, dancing, weaving their old pattern.\nLeaving information on where\nto begin again:\nJust a thought\nStelios\nPoetIC is the creative writing society of Imperial College.

Union\nmembers will stop completing the\nnecessary documentation for these\nassessments.\nMATTHEW KEMP TON Last Friday the editors of Orbital,\nRoyal Holloway's student new spa per, burned copies in an incinerator\nand waved placards outside their\nunion building. They were demonstrating against what they saw as the\nunion censoring the paper to cover\nup corruption in the student union\nlast year.\nOne of the main allegations related to vote rigging in last years sabbatical elections. Most of the censored article was based on inside\ninformation from a third year stu-dent, Matthew Bricknell. He was\neducation welfare assistant last year\nbut resigned over the summer. He\nwas then sacked from his job at the\nunion bar and banned from the union\naltogether. The double page article\nwas just going to print when Mr\nBricknell retracted his statement,\nwhich consisted of letters and\nrecorded interviews on tape.\nAlthough he had signed legal do cu There are also threats of action\nagainst \"examinations and assess-ment, or a slow down on student\nadmissions\". This action was voted\nfor along with the strike vote, and\nwas accepted with a far greater\nmajority than the strike itself, so\ncould have a huge impact.\nment s affirming his statement, solicitors acting on behalf of the Union\nand Mr Bricknell threatened to sue if\nthe article went ahead. Siva\nGaneshanandan the union's general\nsecretary ordered the article to be\nripped out of every paper. Last year\nthe Orbital reported on elections for\nthe position of general secretary,\nwhich Siva Ganeshanandan won.\nOne candidate was banned from the\nunion because the welfare officer\nsaid he was a racist and homo ph obe, the ban was later overturned. In the\nsame elections the ballot box was\nfound to contain 40 more votes than\nwere registered.\nA statement from Orbital said\n\"We believe that the article we are\nbeing forced to withdraw is not only\ntrue, but just begins to uncover the\nextent of the irregularities and discrepancies which took place in the\nunion in the last academic year\". The\nstatement went on to call for a full\ninvestigation.\n200 GIRLS : 1 BLOKE\nLast Thursday, there was widespread\ndisturbance at Wimbledon railway\nstation, south-west London. A riot-ing, screaming, brawling crowd,\nentirely made up of roughly 200\nschoolgirls caused chaos with a large\nscale fight.\nShopkeepers were forced to lock\nup and traffic was brought to a standstill as the scrap spilled onto the road.\nPassers-by were dragged into the\nfray completely at random. It was\nonly with the arrival of Police officers waving truncheons that some\nsemblance of order could be\nrestored.\nThe fight had started when two\ngirls, one from Ricards Lodge High\nSchool, the other from Ursuline\nHigh, had started to argue about one\nof the boys from Wimbledon\nCollege. It didn't take long for all\ntheir friends to join in, turning a personal argument into a screaming,\nkicking brawl.\n\"This lad at our school is going out\nwith a girl from Ursuline, but another girl at Ricard Lodge fancies him.\nThat's what the fight was all about,\"\nexplained a pupil from Wimbledon\nCollege. Although there is a lot of\nbad feeling between these two\nschools, people were amazed that\nmore than 200 girls would fight over one blok e.A police officer remarked \"You\njust don't expect this sort of thing\nbetween girls. This was a bloody\nriot.\"\nEAST MEETS WEST\nA slightly late start did not detract\nfrom the \"East Meets West\" show\nlast Tuesday. It turned out to be a thoroughly enjoyable and well-organised event exuding colour,\nhumour and energy.\nAs part of the Diwali celebrations set up by the Indian Society, it\nwas decided that, in the light of the\nforthcoming merger between\nImperial College and Charing Cross\nand Westminster Medical School,\nthe show would be staged in The\nGreat Hall in Sherfield, and not at\nCharing Cross as it normally was.\nThe show was a sell-out, with\nover 700 people buying tickets. It\nwas planned with charity in mind,\nwith all the evening's proceeds going\nto the Leukaemia Research Fund and\nthe Jaipur Limb appeal.\nTwo students, one a medic and\nthe other from IC, did a good job as\nthe com peres, who despite keeping\nup a derisory repartee, emphasised\nthat they were breaking new ground\nand \"leading the way into the future.\"\nThe programme was varied, with\ntraditional dances, fashion parades,\nsingers and comedy sketches. The\nhighlight of the night depended on\nwhat sex you were, with a selection\nof \"professional models\" for the boys\nand at least two toned torsos for the\ngirls. The audience were keen to participate and the male com per e was\nasked at one point to \"Come up here,\nsexy\" by one particularly forthright\nlady.\nThe only dubious parts were the\nchronic hairdos, some very glum\nmodels, and the infinite thank-yous\nand goodbyes at the end.\nThe drummers rounded off the\nnight with a rousing performance\nwhich got the audience in the mood\nfor the after-show party, which finished at 1.30pm. Dinesh Dhoona,\none of the choreographers, described\nthe show as \"the best ever. It was a dream come true.\"\nVideotapes of the complete performance will soon be available from\nthe Student Television of Imperial\nCollege.\nULU COUNCIL\nThe second University of London\nUnion Council of the year meeting\nsaw a raft of motions presented for\ndiscussion by the ULU executive. On\nthe table were a motion proposing a campaign against fees, one requiring\nthe sabbaticals' support of ULU's International Night and a motion to\npass the new ULU regulations.\nTwo contentious motions originally on the agenda were withdrawn at\nthe last minute following early\namendments and a change of mind\nby the motion's proposer. These\nwere a paper on Student\nMaintenance proposed by ULU\nWelfare s abb Paul Bates, and a motion to ban clubs that used guns\nproposed by ULU LGB officer and\nIC student Jo Paice.\nAfter much debate, all motions\ntabled were passed more or less without alteration. However, the motion\non the campaign against fees had\nsome specific points removed from\nthe paper pertaining to the cause and\neffect of the implementation of top-up fees, whilst the motion on\nInternational Night was passed\nunscathed.\nThe Council saw the first public\nouting for newly elected part-time\ns abb Nick Dearden, who replaced\nClaire Lawrie as Vice-Predident for\nFinance and Services.\nCorruption at Royal Holloway\n\n"

However, due\nto the lack of water in the preferred\nrivers, and the use of the new, seemingly in destruct able, two seater\nteaching kayak our plans were\naltered.\nAfter arriving early on Saturday\nmorning we woke up early (honestly,\nwe did) and set off for the Aber\nGlaslyn. After scraping and knuckling down the top section, being fear-less/stupid, we decided to attempt the\ngorge taking a beginner down in the\ntwo seater. A probe team was sent\ndown first with all the usual probe\nbeater problems. After they had\nshown us quite impressively where\nnot to get stuck or pinned, and where\nto avoid three-boat pile-ups, we set\noff.\nThe two seater charged down the\nriver (well, bounced might be more\naccurate) and they managed to only\ncome out and swim once, putting a big dent in the back which had\nmended itself by the next morning.\nEven the breaker (many pointed\nrocks) was negotiated superbly by a brave and trusting beginner and\nGarth (acting like a fish for the third\ntime this week).\nUnfortunately the rest of us were\nnot quite as impressive, going down\nbackwards and swimming (OK, so it\nwas me who went swimming).\nAfter all the excitement, it was\nback to the hut for chilli (of course)\nand lots of beer, thanks to Ross and\nthe chocolate eating kip kid Drew,\nwho procured us this banquet.\nSo to Sunday, and the middle section\nof the Conwy. Now back on a fairly\nsensible river, the beginners were\ntaught the essential basics of paddling on a flowing river. They coped\namazingly on a tough stretch of\nwater, with an astoundingly low\nnumber of swims.\nIf the in nan e grins on everyone's faces afterwards is any indication,\nthen fun was had by all, and we are\nall looking forward to our next trip.\nAnyone interested in cano ing can\nmeet the canoe club at 7.15 on a Tuesday evening in Beit for a pool\nsession. Our next river trip is to the\nRiver Dart next weekend. All standards are welcome.\nStrong performances all round for IC rugby\nIC MEN'S THIRD XV The first-half of the game proved\ndifficult. After c once e ding thirty\npoints to UCL, the IC Thirds recollected their thoughts during the\ninterval, and so dominated the sec-on d half that UCL were unable to\nimprove on their score.\nWith an a gres sive return, IC\nshowed their prowess as a well disciplined squad. Relentless tackling\nand recycling from the forwards\nunleashed the pace and swift handling of the backs. Little more than\nten minutes into the match the the\nback-row co-ordinated with the centres to put Toby Hoakin in for a converted try. A second try was sealed\nin the corner from another back row man oe vre minutes later.\nWith the spirit and pressure generated during the second-half, it was\nonly a shame more points didn't come. In the end, the score line didn't reflect the effort that IC put in, with\nUCL taking the match by thirty\npoints to twelve.\nIC MEN'S SECOND XV SERGE BLANCO FELIX RUGBY CORRESPONDENT\nNeeding a victory to ensure progress\ninto the play-offs in the BUSA\nnational championships, IC Seconds\nproduced a top notch performance,\nand demolished LSE to the tune of a massive (and almost unbelievable)\nmargin of fifty (that's right, fifty)\npoints to nil.\nFrom the opening kickoff, IC\nmade their intentions clear, with a seven phase sequence moving IC to\nthe LSE try line. Capitalising on the\nopportunity offered by a strike\nagainst the head, Darren Bryce bulldozed in to open the floodgates.\nContinuity was a major theme of the\nmatch, with the IC pack able to continuously recycle the ball and make\nfurther inroads into a bele a gu red LSE defence.\nTries flowed thick and fast, with\nMichael Peachment, Dave Chatagy\nand Barry Richards making one each\nbefore half-time. The game was\nsewn up by the interval with IC\nstretching the lead out of the Economists reach, rampaging to 31-0.\nIn the second-half IC kept up the\npressure, and further tries followed\nfor Kolone Yung (his fourth of the\nyear), James Sopper and Michael\nPeachmont (with his second of the\nday). Fullback Justin Lee supplied\nfive conversions, adding a further ten\npoints to the rapidly swelling IC\nscore line. To be truthful, LSE never stood a chance, as IC systematically took\nthem to the cleaners, as the score line so clearly demonstrates.\nSkipper Julian Harrison was\nextremely satisfied with the team\nperformance - though next weeks\nopponents will hopefully provide\nstiffer opposition.\nThe whole team then retired to\nKhan's for a well deserved victory\nmeal, happy in the knowledge that\nglory is within their grasp.\nIC WOMEN'S XV The driving rain did nothing to\ndampen IC's spirits in their first\ngame of the season, against Barts.\nWe hit them hard in the first ten\nminutes, with Sarah Waiman scoring a storming first try. The opposition began to fight back, but excellent defence work kept Barts at bay\nfor the rest of the first-half.\nAfter the break, IC began to fight\nback, with Petra delivering a second\ntry to boost the winning margin to a convincing ten points, with the final\nscore IC 10, Barts 0.\nEveryone played well, especially\nthe new girls. In particular, some\nsuperb flying tackles from Clare,\nand a formidable front row led by\nMo, were key in this victory. The\nplayers of the match were Mo\nBradley for the forwards, and Petra\nVacas for the backs.\nThe team performance showed\nhuge promise for the remainder of\nthe season.\n\n"

A voyage of\ndiscovery\nThe rest of the intrepid expedition had gone to\nbrave the mountains of Kolumbangara's interior\n(Kolumbangara is one of the Solomon Islands,\nin the Western Pacific), and I had been told, with\nall due subtlety, that as a mere girl, I would slow\nthem down.\nThis left me at a loose end in a male dominated training camp - the envy my friends had\nshown when I told them I would be sharing my\nholiday with eighty 16-21 year old lads (and\nfive Australian monks) proving to have been\nmisplaced. So, I borrowed a dug out canoe and\nset out to sea. It was about 8 'o' clock, and the\nsun illuminated the rainbow of colours thrown\nout by the coral, living on the shallow seabed,\neasily visible through the crystal clear tropical\nwater.\nAs I paddled on, following the shoreline\naround the mountainous tropical island, I passed\na few palm leaf huts and an overwhelming number of half-dressed native children. A school of\ndolphins soon joined me, swimming in front of\nthe canoe - but always keeping their distance.\nThe Solomon islanders consider them a pest as\nthey eat the precious tuna stocks, and the dolphins have learnt to stay out of spear's reach.\nYet the dolphins stayed with the my canoe; leaping across its path as I continued my voyage, on\naround the island.\nFollowing the coastline of this beautiful\nisland, you begin to feel that you are no longer\non the same planet as that inhabited by SW7the clear turquoise oceans, clean air and simple\nnative ways of life are so far removed from the\nunstoppable pace of twentieth century living that\nwe have all grown up with. Indeed, you easily\nbegin to be lii eve that some mythical shield protects this lon ley paradise from the forces of\nchange.\nYet all of a sud-den, the\nreality of\nthe modem world\nhits you\nsmack in |\nthe face...\nStrangers in\nparadise\nThough it is ac liche, it is unfortunately true that\nnowhere on earth is entirely perfect, and the\nbare patches on the mountain side stood out as a testament to the destructive power of the logging industry. The loggers are at the root of\ndeep and bitter disputes between the island's community which reach right down to family\nlevel.\nIn the Solomon Islands, titles like \"chief are\npassed on mainly through the paternal line, and\nthe chiefs are seen as caretakers of the land. But\nit is the woman who actually own the land,\npassed on through the maternal line. However,\nthe logging companies had gone into the islands\nassuming that the land was owned by the chiefs.\nConsequently, they thought that they had\nobtained permission to log the forest.\nUnfortunately, as the the chiefs did not actually\nown the land many cases have gone to court.\nThe matter of land rights and logging has led to\nfeuds within families in a society where the\nsense of family is extremely strong and looking\nafter your 'want ok s'( relations) is a social\nresponsibility.\nAlthough this system has many advantages -there are no beggars, and all the old and infirm\nare looked after by their families - it also has a system of strict taboos. A husband is not\nallowed to go to the bathroom if his wife's brothers are in the same house, and while climbing Mount Popamanseu I was asked to keep my\nhair tied up, as the local giant took offense to\nlong hair,and would \"do your hair in\" if he was\nangered.\nLater, paddling along the coast of an idyllic\nisland in the increasingly fierce sun, Mount\nPopamanseu seemed less daunting, though\nother dangers exist for those in canoes.\nTararamanu, the\nSea Devil, will\nonly venture forth\non clear moonlit\nnights when his\nanger spurs him\nto lightening\nstrikes.

    "content": "6 NEWS FELIX FRIDAY 22ND NOVEMBER\nGardens of Enlightenment?\nSimon Wistow and Michael Roberts are enlightened by reading IC's application for\ns pond u licks from the Millenium Comission but have to ask....\nIs it all worth it?\nOne of the first things people\nnotice when they come to Imperial is\nthat, frankly speaking, the architecture is as inspiring as a flat tire on a rainy night in Moss Side. Yes that is\na clich ed complaint oft heard around\nthe JCR (I'm not even going to mentioned the lack of women, whoops),\nbut when I came to have my interview here I was very nearly put off\nby how ugly everything was. If\nImperial didn't have such a good reputation then I would never have\ncome. But (and the large cranes\naround the campus are a big hint)\nthings are afoot to renovate the area\nand generally change our dear\nCollege into something we can be\nproud of.\nThe obvious improvements are, of\ncourse, the BMS building and the\nLibrary. Despite a few set-backs (and\nnear deaths) these are at last under\nway. However the most important\nrestructuring is yet to come.\nThe area around Dalby court is to\nbe completely transformed and to\nhelp pay for the mammoth costs the\nCollege has put in a bid to the\nMillenium Comission. There is currently \u00a3300m being invested by the\nGovernment, the Lottery and private\nfinance in the South Kensington area,\nbut this project will be centered\nentirely around the the Civil Eng\nbuilding and is composed of some,\nhow shall we say this, interesting\nideas.\nThe College wishes to remove the\nexisting car and postal van parking\nspaces from Imperial College road\nand relocate them to a new, underground car park. This new, two level\nbuilding will provide up to 200\nspaces, and would allow parking for\nstaff cars during the day, the Albert\nHall at night and the various\nMuseums at the weekend.\nBy removing vehicles from\nImperial College road, the Queens\nLawn would become more accessible\nand would be opened to the public,\nalong with the Arts and Music Centre\non top of the Library and the rest of\nDalby Court, where \"a sequence of\nre vitali sed spaces would be created...\ncalled The Gardens Of Enlightenment\" (featuring the Shrub of\nRighteousness and the Tree of\nUniversal Knowledge, perchance?\nWho thinks these things up? Cheech\nand Chonch? David Ike? Neil from\nthe Young Ones?).\nAlso on the cards is a new campus\nentrance at the the junction of\nImperial College road and Exhibiton\nroad which will include a link to a subway system, connecting the South\nKensington Underground station, the\nNatural History Museum and the\nVictoria & Albert Museum. After\nremoving the traffic from Imperial\nCollege road, there are plans to build\na tree lined avenue, which will be\ntrimmed in the centre to allow light\nonto the piece de resistance - a rip-p ling, undulating, canal with bridges\nacross it. Apparently, \"the form of\nthe canal with its sinusoidal curves\nand the gravel avenue will contrast\nwith the more formal layout of the\nQueens lawn, with its central water\nfeature...\"\n\"Central water feature?\" I hear you\ncry? \"there ain't no water on the\nQueens lawn\". Ah, but this is all to\nchange. French landscape architect,\nAlain Provost, is being brought in to\ncreate a kinetic art piece, using computer controlled fountain jets, which\ncan be programmed to change height,\nduration and at night, colour and\nlight.\nTo quote the Millenium app lica tion, \"We will exploit this technology in an array of 100 or more jets, to\nprovide sequences of aesthetic representations of the structure of the elements - orbiting electrons could, for\nexample, be isolated, high thrown\npackets of water in transient, concentric shells, around a more stable\nnucleus of protons and neutrons. The\nperiodic table itself could be represented on a large scale in the\ncoloured paving of the fountain\npi aza.\" Eh?\nThe Queens lawn will be resolved\nto bring it onto the same height as\nImperial College road, making it the\nfocal point along the east-west axis.\nThis landscaping would create an\nopen air cafe space in front of the\nSherfield Building. A mixture of\nhard paving, grass and gravel will\nhelp to 'soften' the space. Above the\nDalby Court car park, there will be an\ninformal space, made either of timber\ndecking or fine gravel. There will be\ntrees in boxes surrounded by seating\nand screens to create smaller spaces\nand since the court is bounded in on\nthe North by the Bessemer building,\nthere are plans for an eight-metre-long geological map of the British\nIsles. This would be executed in\nstone, with each of the main geological units being represented by its own\nrock type. It would be surrounded by\nlarge shaped boulders, from classic\ngeological sites. Are they crazy?\nThe estimated total cost? A snip at\n\u00a36,000,000.00 of which the College\nanticipates half will be paid for by a grant from the Commission and half\nfrom revenue from the car park and\note hr retail opportunities.\nFor once I cannot be accused of making all this up. I have, in my hands at\nthis very moment, a copy of Dalby\nCourt and Landscaping Milenium\nLottery Application, a document prepared by Foster and Partners, the\nvery expensive architecture company\nrun by Sir Norman Foster. This nominally confidential document was\nsupplied by a helpful source within\nCollege administration (it is how ver in the public domain).\nEven to the untrained eye this document is, to be frank, pants. It seems\nhurried and scrap pil y put together,\nwith a bit of wish y was hyland s cap ing-babble and some photos and diagrams to pad out space. This is our\napplication to the Millenium com-mission. True, an attached memo\nstates that \"if the bid makes the\nCommissions' initial long list, further\ndetailed work will be required\", but\nsurely it is first impressions that\ncount. How can the application be\ntaken seriously if it is so poor?\nEspecially when it is hidden among\nthe hundreds of thousands of other\napplicants for Millenium money.\nConsidering how much we are paying Sir Norm I think we should have\na slightly more impressive document.\nAnd why is the document confidential? Don't we have a say in what is\ndone?\nI'm sure future fresher s will enjoy\nsearching for the few women at IC\nalong the shady banks of our very\nown aqueous sine wave and, if they\nget lucky, sitting hand in hand, next\nto a tree in a enclosed space above a car park. The public can \"ooh\" and\n\"ahh\" at the splendid atomic fountain\ncomplete with orbiting electrons and\nlarge scale periodic table for amnesiac chemists.\nSince the area will be public\naccess, suitable drug dealers may\neven be on hand to enhance the\n'Enlightening'. If this development\nhas public access, whose jurisdiction\nwill it fall under? Will it be up to Ken\nWeir and his present Security Force\nto combat the inevitable rise in petty\ncrime and the distinct pos sibi l ty of\nvandalism and half-inching, requiring College to employ more guards\neither internally or from an outside\nfirm, or should it become the police's responsibility?\nThe whole project has potential\nand it would be nice to be able to\nlook in the Imperial College prospectus for 1999/2000 and not cringe at\nthe 60s concrete block style architecture but I think (and hey, I'm never\noutspoken) that maybe the students\nshould have a little more input in to\nthe whole shebang.\nAlso, if I was being cynical, I would say that maybe there are a few\nthings more important that six thou-sand, thousand squids could be spent\non (maybe renovating Evelyn gardens or rebuilding those buildings\nthat were built in the 60s to last 20\nyears, for example). This could all be\na moot point, though, because judging by our application, I wouldn't be\nsurprised if we came away with nothing to spend.\n\"If this development has public\naccess, will it oe up to Security\nto combat the inevitable rise in\npetty crime and the distinct pos-sibi l ty of vandalism and half-inching, or should it become the\npolice's responsibility?\"\n\n"

Telephone/fax: 0171 594 8072\nCopyright Felix 1996. ISSN 1040-0711\nEditor Alex Feakes / Advertising Manager Mark Baker\nSTRIKE ONE?\nIn a rare display of solidarity and\naction, the College was closed this\nweek by the combined effect of tech-nic ian s, manual workers and lecturers striking. The issues that have\nbrought these disparate groups\ntogether are firstly money, and secondly the state of HE in Britain.\nThe level of anger amongst the\npickets on Tuesday morning was\nrunning high. The weather for the\noccasion, freezing rain, sleet and\nsnow, was perhaps suited to the miserable state of affairs that prompted\nthe action. Higher education is in a mess, they said, through lack of fund-ing, lack of attention, and lack of\nrespect for the hundreds of thousands\nof students, workers and lecturers.\nNationwide, the day of action was\nstartlingly successful, with all HE\nestablishments affected. The AUT\nwere early in claiming a majority of\ninstitutions more or less closed by the\nstrike. In London, University College\nwas closed, King's College severely\nunder-staffed and many smaller colleges were also affected. At IC, nearly all 600 technical and support staff\nwere on strike, as were a number of\nlecturers, and at least five departments were closed completely.\nHowever, despite calls by the\ndemonstrators to support their action,\nand an NUS policy to join the strike,\npicket lines were still breached by\nstudents, and lectures still took place.\nIt would seem that a day off in passive support of a protest against cuts\nin HE funding - which ultimately\naffect all students - is less favourable\nthan braving the cold and wet for a few understaffed lectures or a chance\nto use the internet. Are students here\nso laid-back that even a day in bed is\ntoo radical for them?\nThe day of protest unfortunately\ncoincided with other equally important items of news, and was not really give the coverage it deserves. A strike by HE personnel is rare - the\nlast was over ten years ago - and\ntherefore deserves good coverage.\nAcademics are sensible people and\nwould not go so far as to strike if they\ndid not have a genuine gri even ce. As the Rector said in his\nCommemoration Day speech, the\nGovernment has stated that there are\nno votes in HE. The implication is\nthat we are a soft target for cuts. This\nweek's action was a valiant effort to\nexpose the complacency behind this\nstance. Let us all hope that next\nweek's Budget reflects the views of\nthe hundreds of thousands of voters\naffected by Higher Education cuts.\nLETTERS TO FELIX\nClayponds talks back\nDear Editor,\nFor fear of this letter sounding a bit 'tit for tat', I shall be brief. I am of\ncourse referring to Danny Segal's response in last week's Felix to my\nprevious letter concerning security at\nClayponds.\nIn my letter I mentioned that I would like to see deadlocks fitted on\nour front doors and used the common\nroom money as a possible means of\nfunding this venture. Danny 'took\nissue' with my 'conclusion' that the\nmost urgent upgrade was in the form\nof better locks for the front doors on\nthe grounds that only one of the burglaries over the summer had\ninvolved entrance through a front\ndoor.\nThis seems to be a case of 'we're\nnot going to spend money on this\nbecause there are other far weaker\npoints that need dealing with first' ie\nhe practically acknowledges that the\ngeneral level of security is appalling.\nWell I'm sorry but the issue of deadlocks IS an important one, not least\nbecause one is unable to get private\nhouse and contents insurance at a sensible premium without such a lock. Instead one is forced to pay the\nhigh 'All Risks' cover offered by the\nCollege for any computers etc which\nshould NOT be classified as 'All\nRisks' unless they are portable and\nyou wish them to be covered when\nout of your room.\nThe common room was merely an\nexample of how College money is\navailable for certain things but not\nfor others. I'm not saying that people\ndon't want one. After all, if somebody issues a questionnaire asking\n'Would you like a Jacuzzi and satellite TV installed in your home ?',\nyou're not going to say no are you?!\nYours sincerely,\nAndrew Payne\nResult for sandwich\ncampaign\nDear Mr Baker,\nThank you for taking up my campaign against QT. I really should\nhave let John Foster write his own\nreply, but as he took the trouble to\ncome and see me personally, and\nappeared not to have read Felix (and\nI am such a kind and un cynical per-son) I thought I would report what he\nsaid. I even let him see what I had\nwritten before I sent it to Felix, hence\nthe use of the words \"trading sur-plus\" where I originally put \"profits\"\nand the bit about the Sandwich Shop\nhaving lower overheads. I thought I repeated the word \"apparently\"\nenough times that it should have\nbeen obvious I was merely reporting\nwhat Mr Foster said and did not necessarily believe it. I would like to\nknow why the college charges its\nown catering department overheads\n(I subsequently added this to my\nreply in Felix, together with the fact\nthat I agreed with your earlier remark\nabout budgets being used to cover\nthings up, but it wasn't published).\nMeanwhile, my letter has also\nbeen in IC Reporter and I have had\nonly praise from my colleagues and\nother staff. Since I wrote my letter,\nMr Foster has undertaken a QT customer survey. I am awaiting the\nresults.\nLinda Hart\nImperial College\nDear Felix,\nIt seems almost churlish to criticise the cheerful budget fodder supplied in Da Vinci's. Many overworked academics punctuate their\nday with their fine coffee, and lunch\ntime sees throngs of brassi c students\nkeeping mind and body united with\ntheir infallible curries.\nBut, as you've probably guessed,\nI'm going to criticise it anyway.\nI have been concerned for some\ntime about the immense quantities of\npolystyrene consumed. Every curry,\nmeal, coffee, cake and even bread\nroll comes with its own quietly dis-tur bing, disconcerting ly white and\nutterly un biodegradable plastic disk.\nOnce a styrene object is created, it is\nnever destroyed. No organism exists\nthat can digest the stuff (though my\nflat mate's working on it) and most\npeople are familiar with the poi so nous, acrid fumes that are produced\non combustion.\nAlso, there are direct health problems associated with consuming\ntrace amounts of common plastics.\nNew research is revealing that they\ncontain chemicals capable of mimicking o estrogen and other sex hor-m ones. In an age where fertility is\ndropping devastating ly fast, this\nshould be a real concern. Polystyrene\nalso releases free radicals (nasty) and\ncan spoil the taste of the food.\nDa Vinci's may not have the space\nand facilities to use real crockery, but\nalternatives exist. Waxed cardboard\nplates and bowls are available to\nalmost any specification. In part icu lar, there is no excuse for using polystyrene for cups; even McDonald'sthe paradigm of materialistic wastefulness and social corruption - use\npaper vessels throughout.\nIts time to take responsibly as con-sumer s. We can't afford to treat our\nworld as a dustbin any longer.\nDavid Ross,\nMech Eng II\nLetters may be edited for length.\nThe guest editor's opinions\nare not necessarily those\nof the editor.\nDeadline for letters in Felix 1071\nis Monday 25th November.\nPlease bring some form of identification.

It was going to\nbe a good benchmark for us since the\nopposition plays in a league higher\nthan ours.\nThe game started off with RSM\nhaving the better play. Ten minutes\ninto the first half Johan was through\non goal, only to be blatantly fouled.\nA clear professional foul, therefore\ndeserving a red card. But the referee\nlet the guilty player off. We did however get a free-kick in a dangerous\nposition. Michael turned the ball\naround the wall, leaving the goalie\nno chance. We then forced a two-nil\nlead, following a magnificent individual effort from Si. After winning\nthe ball, he easily passed three\ndefenders and then chipped the\ngoalie. Without question, this was\nthe goal of the season.\nHowever, RSM then - whether out\nof compassion or merely lack of concentration - handed the opposition\nthe initiative. Charring Cross did create some half-chances, but could not\ncapital is e on their achievements until\ntwenty minutes from time. Although\nLarson managed a touch, the ball\ncould not be prevented from going\nin, to reward Charring Cross for their\nefforts.\nKeith, in keeping with a long tradition of RSM attacking right-backs,\nrestored the two goal lead. Johan\nthen had a chance to add to the score-line, when we were awarded a penalty kick. However, he opted instead\nfor a rather convincing impression of\nGareth Southgate.\nAll in all, this was a good result,,\nthanks to a good combined performance from the entire team.\nIC BASKETBALL SECURES\nNUMBER ONE SPOT\nT MOURITIS\nIC basketball Men's first team\nsecured the first place in their group\nlast week, after crushing the (not particularly strong) resistance of St\nGeorge's Medical School. The difference in technical skills between\nthe players of the two team, strengthened by the fact that St George's only came up with five players for\nthe match is mirrored on the final\nscore: an astonishing 105-28.\nThis would have been even bigger,\nif we didn't have to get out of the\ncourt as we were running out of time.\nThe next match for the team will be\nan away play-off, probably against\nKing's college, later today. A victory\nwill put IC through to the BUSA last\n32.\nIf you would fancy watching a strong basketball match involving\nyour university team, check our\nnoticeboard for the details.\nThe Men's second team, unfortunately, paired their defeats, this time\nby QMW 2nd. The performance was\nmuch better than in the first match,\nbut the result was fair, as QMW were\nstronger under the basket. Now the\nSeconds have five home matches in a row, and can perhaps change their\nluck and performance.\nMIXED FORTUNES FOR IC CROSS-COUNTRY\nFOOTBALL SECONDS OVERCOME\nBATTLING KING'S The latest fixture in this seasons\ncross-country championship saw\nboth of IC's teams journeying to\nWimbledon Common, where the\nmen could only put in a sub-standard\nperformance.\nGood individual achievements\nwere let down by \"A pint of what?\"\nFishick. Gaffer, Ponytail and ThreeCubed put in great showings, finishing tenth, sixteenth and eighteenth\nrespectively, but our \"star runner\"\ndid not even bother to grace us with\nhis presence.\nIn spite of coming in a car, the\nwomen mustered the energy to dom-in ate. Jennie won, again, and Maria\nput in a good run, despite this being\nher first race this year.\n\"Yellow-arse\" finally managed to\nbeat the guest seventy year-old run-ner, by kicking his Zimmerframe\naway. And where were the\nFlowerpot Men? - out looking for\nWombles!\nYet another great day out was\nassured, however, thanks to the barmaid with the short skirt at the Grid\nInn, who provided hours of entertain-ment.\nThe most important day of the season so far ended in glorious victory\non and off the pitch for the IC\nSeconds.\nWith the league stage of the\nBUSA cup on a knife-edge, \"IC\nSlags\" needed a win to secure a place\nin the next round. A depleted IC side\nhad lost 3-0 to King's last Saturdaytoday grit and determination were\nneeded to ensure a return victory,\nand we showed both.\nThe first half was scrappy and\nsadly disrupted by a King's midfielder who was clearly there to foul, dive\n- and not much else. Unfortunately,\nwith the referee struggling to maintain control German, our bruising\nGeorgian defender, took matters into\nhis own hands in an incident that\nearned both players involved a book-ing.\nA rousing half-time speech from\ncaptain marvel Steve stirred our\nblood and within minutes we were\non top thanks to our deadly duo up\nfront. A through ball from the mighty\nRobo put Alex in to score, and this\nwas rapidly followed up when a deep\ncross let Martin head neatly back\nacross goal and into the net. There\nthen followed a period of consolidation with our back four of Blondie,\nWill, German and Phil \"the pill\" controlling play, and effectively blocking King's from taking any initiative.\nA rare defensive lapse let King's pull one back and the game caught\nfire. Both sides put in a mighty effort\nbut our class showed through as the\nball was worked around their area to\nFelix, who produced a sensational\nstrike into the top corner - rippling\nthe net and breaking King's hearts.\nThe game ended with the dismissal\nof their midfielder, whose conduct\nthroughout the match was nothing\nshort of disgraceful.\nThe victory was topped off in\nSouthside bar later in the evening as\nthe IC footballers faced up to IC\nrugby club in a seven-man boat race.\nNaturally, we emerged triumphant.\nAll in all, a great day for IC\nSeconds.\nRESULTS\nFENCING IC MEN261 ROYAL HOLLOWAY IC WOMEN216 ROYAL HOLLOWAY BASKETBALL IC MEN1 ST10528 ST GEORGE' SIC MEN2 ND7094 QUEEN MARY2 ND FOOTBALL I C1ST02 KING'S1 STIC1 ST03 ST MARY' SIC2 ND31 KING'S2 N DIC2 ND00 QUEEN MARY2 N DIC3 RD37 KING'S3 R DIC4 TH22 QUEEN MARY4 THR S M1ST31 CHARRING CROSS RUGBY IC2 ND500 LSE IC3 RD1230 UCL IC WOMEN100 BARTS HOCKEY RS M XI160 CHARING CROSS "

    "content": "4 NEWS FELIX FRIDAY 22ND NOVEMBER\nPolice exhibit charity streak in Rag stunt\nMARIA IOANNOU\nLast Saturday saw the latest outing of\nthe infamous Sponsored Nude\nKamikaze Parachute Jump. This is\nthe annual excuse for a small group\nof IC students to get their kit off and\nstreak from Harrods to Beit Quad, all\nin the name of charity. This year, for\nthe first time ever, the rag event managed to acquire a police escort.\nBy 9:15 am last Saturday, eight\nbrave men had gathered in Beit Quad\nto psych themselves up for the ordeal\nthat lay ahead. Last minute doubts\nover the route were dispelled by old\nhands who described those wishing\nto take a shorter run through the back\nstreets of Knightsbridge as \"girly\nwusses.\"\nFollowing tradition, the intrepid\nband had already decided to go\nstraight down Cromwell Road and\nthen straight up Exhibition Road.\nStanding with just a few layers protecting them from the cold, several of\nthe participants hoped that there\nwould be several tourists around the\nmuseums that day, perhaps giving\nsome insight as to the sort of people\nwho gladly declo the in public.\nAs the jump time of 10:00am neared, the excitement and nervousness of the jumpers rose. First-time\nstreak ers all (few do it twice), the\njourney toward Harrods was punctuated with nervous chatter and chilly\nbreath, uns uprising ly for people just\nwearing their pants and jackets. It\nwas now 9:50, with traffic from Hell,\nand there were hordes of impatient\nshoppers thronging the pavements\noutside Harrods and Knightsbridge\nUnderground station.\nTo facilitate the 'mission', the\nminibus turned down a side road just\nbefore Harrods, allowing them time\nto whip off their knickers and struggle out of their jackets. At the prearranged signal, the door opened and\nthey leaped out and started running\nup the road towards the waiting\ncrowds. Almost at once, startled\nonlookers began laughing and cheer-ing, as the streak ers became blobs of\npink amongst the traffic. A group of\nonlookers began a rousing chorus of\nRule Britannia.\nOne of the crowd, positioned just\nby the Harrods entrance to\nKnightsbridge tube described what\nhe saw: \"They ran straight across the\nmain road, and were generally greeted by applause and adulation from\nthe crowd. The roads were packed,\nbut the traffic all stopped to let them\npast. Taxis honked their horns, drivers waved, passengers stood up\nthrough sunroofs to get a better look.\nThese guys were instant celebrities.\"\n\"They ran along the opposite pave-ment, pedestrians clapping them as\nthey went past, to the continued\nlaughter and support of everyone on\nthe other side of the road. As they ran\npast, the doors of Harrod's opened\nwith exquisite timing. On the road,\nthere was a double decker bus and\nthe entire top deck were looking out\nof the window, waving and cheering.\nNot far behind the bus, a Police van\nwas waiting, but it was trapped in the\nmiddle lane.\"\nThe route followed by the r aggies took them along Knightsbridge on to\nCromwell Road and right up\nExhibition Road, and from there to\nthe Union Building. However, by the\nVictoria nd Albert Musuem, one of\nthe runners was clearly lagging\nbehind. He later claimed to have been\nrunning beyond his aerobic limit, but\nother observers said that a female\npedestrian wanted his photograph.\nMeanwhile, the others were jogging past the Natural History\nMuseum, where there was someone\nselling the Big Issue. \"Sorry, no\nchange!\" shouted one of the runners.\nAt the corner of Exhibition Road and\nPrince Consort Road, the group\npaused to consider options. The\nmajority chose to run a victory lap\naround the Albert Hall. The last runner was clearly in trouble, and decided to head back to the Union.\nThis laggard had one more piece\nof bad luck to befall him before he\nsaw his trousers again. A mere twenty yards from the Union, while casually strolling past the Royal College\nof Music, the long arm of the law\ncaught up with him. Watched by\nbemused spectators, including a Felix mole, a Police car pulled next\nto the perambulating nude and with\nan \"Oi, you. Stop!\" he was accosted\nby the boys in blue.\nSatisifed that it was merely a students stunt for charity and not some\nform of massive campaign of civil\ndisobedience, the policemen accompanied the student back to the Rag\noffice. Luckily, the police decided\nnot to press charges, and didn't even\ntake the details of the runner they\ncaught, saying it was unfair to do\nanything to him just because he was\nthe slowest. Showing a charity streak\nthey commented that \"women and\nchildren didn't want to see naked\noverweight blok es on the streets.\"\nThe event raised several hundred\npounds for charity, and was generally reckoned to be a success by Rag\nChair Andy Southern, with more\npeople participating than in the past.\nSelkirk Hall experiences Tarantula trauma\nNEWS TEAM A chance discovery has exposed a student at Selkirk Hall who has been\nkeeping a tarantula in his bedroom\nsince the beginning of term. The pet\nwas discovered after a re-app found\ncrickets, bred by the student to feed\nthe spider, jumping around his shower cubicle.\nAccording to insect experts, a full-grown tarantula can eats about 8-10\ncrickets per week. Unfortunately for\nthe student involved, some of these\nescaped. Other then the re-app, a number of Selkirk Hall students have\nreported seeing some of them, mostly in the area of staircase six. Some\nwere spotted sitting in kitchen sinks,\nothers lurking in the showers. The\npresence of these crickets led to the\ndiscovery of the tarantula.\nWhen asked to comment on the\nsituation, the Assistant Subwarden of\nSelkirk Hall remarked, \"I really don't think this is news, so I'm not going to\nbe helpful.\" Dr. Hassard, the warden,\nwas unavailable for comment.\nThe College position has always\nbeen that students are not allowed to\nkeep pets while they are staying in\nhalls of residence, so the heart-bro-ken student was given 48 hours in\nwhich to get rid of his unwelcome\npet. Unconfirmed rumours suggest\nthat he took it to the Biology department to be looked after, leaving it in\nthe common room in the hope that\nsome kind soul would take it in.\nThe Housekeeper of Selkirk, Mr\nPappalardo, who had been away and\nwas therefore unaware of this,\nexpressed amazement at the tarantula\nand other wildlife. \"It isn't as if a tarantula is easy to hide, not like a cat\nor a dog. Next we will be getting\nchimpanzees jumping up and down\nthe galleries. This place isn't meant\nto be a zoo!\"\n\n"

Few lectures and tutorials took\nplace, most of which were taken by\nstaff who were officially on strike,\nbut who had decided to teach without\nreceiving pay.\nAn estimated 600 technical and\nsupport staff joined the majority of\nthe teaching staff striking over their\nproposed pay rise of1.5%. The eventual outcome of the strike can not be\nknown at present, but there was a feeling among those on the picket\nlines that the level of anger reflected\nby so many people from higher education striking at once must have a positive effect on the profile of\nHigher Education. Unfortunately, the\nstrike coincided with a fire in the\nChannel Tunnel and the year's first\nsnow, so national news coverage was\nbrief at the best.\nMany people, from technicians to\nlecturers braved the freezing wind\nand sleet to be outside Imperial as\nearly as 7am. Strikers stood around\nin rather uneasy lines handing out\nleaflets and carrying placards; it was\nimmediately obvious that these people were not used to striking, or taking any sort of action. No attempt\nwas made to stop people from getting\ninto the College, unlike at some institutions where post was prevented\nfrom getting in (though none was\ndelivered within IC yesterday), or\nmilkmen turned away.\nUnion leaders continued to\nemphasise the need for better staff\npay, but those on the picket lines saw\nthe occasion as one to express anger\nat the lack of funding for Higher\nPHOTO: ALDUS Picketers distributing flyers explaining their cause to passer's by outside\nthe main gates on Exhibition Road.

Speaking to Felix,\npicket ers revealed a whole range of\nreasons as to why the strikes were\ntaking place. For one man, a member\nof the MSF (Management, Science\nand Finance workers union), it\nseemed simply to be a case of \"The\nmajority of the union voted for a strike, and I'm a democrat.\" Many\nfelt that the strike was not about their\nown pay, but about the quality of\nHigher Education, which was seen as\nsuffering due to lack of funding and\nseveral commented that they were\nsupporting the students too by their\naction.\nOne striker said \"The whole of HE\nis screwed\" due to Government cuts.\nHe expressed feelings of de moral is a tion among workers over a system\nthat forced workers to apply for\ngrants to pay their own salary. The\nsame man has been on short term\ncontracts at IC for eight years, and is\nreluctantly leaving HE for a perm a Bryon Wilson, president of\nICAUT (Imperial College\nAssociation of University Teachers)\nsaid that they were \"leaning over\nbackwards not to affect students too\nmuch\" in their effort to get better pay\nfor staff, which is seen as a way of\nraising moral and standards in\nUniversities. Those on the picket line\nwere more candid, pointing out that\n\"students wouldn't think twice about\nmissing lectures if they had been out\non the piss\" and did not feel that\nmissing one day would affect them\nmuch. Some picket ers expressed dismay that there were so many students\ncoming in to College during the\nstrike, a move that was felt to be contrary to the strike's aim. The majority of these students claimed to be at\nCollege to use the computer fac ili ties.\nSpeaking to Felix, Caroline Fox,\nCollege's Head of Personnel,\nexplained that while the College supported the unions' stance in pri nci ple, they were sticking to the nationwide position agreed by the CVCP to\nremain united to granting employees\nmore than a1.5% pay deal without\nfurther cash from the Government.\nAmongst strikers, the feeling was\nthat the quality of teaching would fall\nif funds continued to be withdrawn,\nparticularly with student numbers\nincreasing. The state of outdated lab\nequipment was also seen as a major\nproblem.\nThe major feeling was that losing\none day's pay was an investment into\nthe future of higher education.\nCampaigners felt that the less pay\nstaff get, the less students get out of\nthem.\nThe issue of where deducted staff\npay will go has still not been\nresolved, as the number of strikers is\nnot yet known. The AUT did ask universities to donate money to their student hardship funds, but while UCL,\nthe University of East Anglia and\nSalford University have all pledged\nto do this, IC seems to have decided\nthat to do this would be illegal, as the\nfunds were allotted to staff pay.\nThe strike was timed to come after\nthe beginning of term, to avoid disruption to Freshers settling in, but\nbefore next Tuesday's budget. The\nunions lobbied parliament at the begging of the summer, and have been\nwaiting since then to strike.\nOne picket claimed that a group of\nJapanese university vice chancellors\nhad come to look at how the British\nuniversity system was run. The date\nthey chose? Tuesday 19 November.\nAs a follow up to the strike on\nTuesday, the unions are proposing a \"Boycott of Bureaucracy\", to start\nfrom last Wednesday. This will\ninvolve targeting the teaching quality\ncontinued on page two\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX FRIDAY 22ND NOVEMBER NEWS 3\nSafety checks on site installed, but doubts remain\nMATHIEU RICHARD\nFollowing the numerous recent incidents on the IC construction sites\n(Felix 1064), which have entered the\nCollege folklore, an independent\naudit commissioned to investigate\nhas finally reported back.\nSeveral new measures have now\nbeen implemented in order to guarantee the safety of the staff and students\nin response to the safety survey. The\nDirector of Estates, Ian Caldwell,\ndescribed this issue as \"of paramount\nimportance\".\nFollowing the last incident, Schal,\nthe main contractor, has decided to\nestablish a permanent Quality\nManager on site, as well as a Safety\nManager, whose responsibilities\ninclude a one-month review of the\nproject. This emphasises the fact that\nall incidents have been proved to be\ndue to \"lapses in quality\" and human\nerror - for example, the cause for the\nMars hopes\ncrash and burn\nSunday, 17th November, saw the\nlaunch of the Mars-96 probe by\nRussia. It was the culmination of\nseven years work and \u00a338.5 million\npounds of funding. Despite high\nhopes and a successful launch the\ncraft made an unexpected return to\nEarth after the fourth series of booster rockets failed to fire.\nThe spacecraft carried a multitude\nof instruments designed to explore\nmars and find out more about the\nRed planet. It had sensors to measure seismic activity, magnetic\nfields, atmospheric pressure and\nmany other variables, in order to\nhelp scientists determine whether or\nnot microscopic life did once live on\nMars.\nAustralian Prime Minister, Paul\nKeating, ordered emergency teams\nto be readied following a warning\nfrom the White House that the probe\ncould crash land there. Luckily the\nprobe crashed into the Pacific ocean.\nThere are, however, fears of a radiation leak as the probe was carrying\nseveral canisters of high-grade plutonium, which powered the probe's generators. Russian scientists have\nclaimed that they would have survived the crash intact.\nImperial College's Professor\nDavid Southwood, from the Space\nand Atmospheric Physics Group,\ndeveloped specialist equipment for\nthe craft.\nceiling collapse in the library walkway at the beginning of term was the\nchoice of too thin a wire for ceiling\nties.\nThese new members of the Schal\nteam are supposed to minimise the\nrisks of something similar happening\nagain by supervising the work of the\ndifferent sub-contractors and enhancing the co-ordination of the teams.\nSchal has also started advanced training sessions to improve the sub-con-tractors' concern for safety, and to\nprepare the workmen more adequately for the specific problems raised by\na construction project in an occupied\nenvironment like the College.\nMore recently, the report commissioned by Mr Caldwell from\nWaterman Safety Ltd about the safety of the installations on site has\nrevealed a few faults in the overall\ndisposition of basic requirements\nsuch as fire extinguishers, service\nladders etc., but has also suggested a couple of measures for the enhancement of the safety controls.\nThe weekly \"disruption meetings,\"\nbetween the Imperial College Safety\nauthorities and representatives of the\nconstruction firms, will now be\nchaired by the College Project\nManager, Ian Frame, in order to plan\nthe disruptions and possible hazards\nahead more than was the case before.\nThe purpose of these meetings,\nwhich have been held since the\nbeginning of the realisation of the\nproject is to avoid as much as possible any nuisances to the staff and students of the College.\nMoreover, the College Safety\nRepresentative Ian Gillet now\ninspects the site weekly, also concentrating on the way the contractors'\nwork affects the College more than\non the effective technical quality of\nthe precise work done. Thus, according to Mr Gillet, both potential causes of incidents will be better mastered - the quality of the work in\nitself, and its direct implications on\nthe everyday life of the College.\nTo the question of whether further\naccidents are still possible, Mr\nCaldwell confidently replied with an\nassured tone \"We believe that what is\nin place should prevent other problems.\" Nevertheless, the particular conditions in which the building work has\nto be done - on a functioning and\ncrowded campus - are certainly still a potential source of incidents.\nStudents are still wary of the works\nfollowing the reports of safety\nbreaches and dangerous constructions reported in previous Felixes. \"I still check the roof just outside the\nlibrary before I go in\" commented\none regular user of the facility. \"I hope it is all worth it in the end.\"\nNot all Degrees\nare Equal...\neij j art ment of Electronics and Computer Scien3 ^\nHere is an opportunity for suitable EC candidates to secure aru fly funded PhD studentship at one of the world's leading Electronics\nand Computer Science departments,\n\u2022 Communications\n\u2022 Computer Aided Design\n\u2022 Declarative Systems and Software Engineering\n\u2022 Image, Speech and Intelligent Systems\n\u2022 Infra Red Science and Technology\n\u2022 Microelectronics\n\u2022 Multimedia Systems\n\u2022 Optical Fibres\n\u2022 Parallel and Distributed Computing\n\u2022 Transducers, Sensors and Instrumentation\nMulti-disciplinary research projects in other areas available.\nEnhanced grants are payable in some circumstances.\n...here's one that will\ntip the Balance.\nEnquiries: Mrs A Donohue,\nDept of Electronics & Computer Science\nTel (01703) 592882\nFax (01703) 592901\nE Mail add@ec s. so ton. ac.uk\nWeb site address http:/A/v ww.e cs.s ot on. ac.uk/\nPlease quote reference:ECS/1\nUniversity of\nSouthampton\nHighfield, Southampton,\nHampshire SOI 7 1BJ United Kingdom.\nExcellence Degrees "

    "content": "FELIX FRIDAY 22ND NOVEMBER\n_ AMNESTY\nINTERNATIONAL\nWITH HUMAN-RIGHTS INCREASINGLY IN FOCUS, SANJAY SIKDAR INVESTIGATES THE WORK OF AMNESTY As many of you will know, Amnesty\nInternational is the world's largest\nvoluntary organisation dealing with\nhuman rights issues. You have probably seen their adverts in magazines\nportraying graphic examples of tor-ture. This bears testament to the high\nprofile Amnesty has. It has 1.1 million members spanning 150 countries and territories with 125,000\nmembers residing in the British Isles.\nAmnesty International was founded\nin 1961 by a British Lawyer, Peter\nBeneson after he heard of human\nrights violations against two\nPortuguese prisoners. It is funded by\nmembers and through the public\nusing strategic fund raising schemes.\nAmnesty International mission\nstatement is simple - to pursue the\nrelease of all prisoners of conscience.\nIn other words, those incarcerated\nsolely for their beliefs, colour, sex,\nreligion, ethnic origin or religion and\nhave not used or advocated violence.\nAmnesty International strives for fair\nand prompt trials of political prison-ers, it opposes extra judicial executions and sudden disappearances\nthat take place in nations who blatantly contravene the concept of\nbasic human rights. Amnesty is also\ntotally against torture, degrading acts\non prisoners and particularly the\ndeath penalty. This applies to political and non political prisoners alike\nbecause there is nothing more inhumane than to give a person the time\nof their death.\nHistorically, Amnesty International focused their energies into\nassisting political prisoners but now\nincludes human rights abuses in its\nmandate. For instance, Amnesty\nfights for asylum seekers who are at\nrisk of being deported only to\nbecome prisoners of conscience and\nface the full wrath of their captors. It\nis against abuses by opposition\ngroups, prisoner killings, hostage\ntaking and genocide such as the\nrecent atrocities in Rwanda. The\norganisation is also concerned by\npeople being forced out of their\nhomelands for reasons of belief, re li gion, colour, ethnic origin and language and who have not retaliated in\nviolence.\nAmnesty International does not\nbelieve in criticising particular\nregimes, and ignores government\nideology as long as there are no violations of human rights - that can\neven occur in supposed democracies.\nSome might say that Amnesty meddles in the internal affairs of states,\nbut surely the issue of human rights\ngoes far beyond boundaries.\nYou may think that being a voluntary organisation Amnesty has no:\npower to enforce their mandate but\nallow me to give you two examples.\nAfter hearing of a nine year old\nEthiopian boy who had been imprisoned all his life along with his moth-er, children in Norway, sent drawings and cards to the Oslo office of\nAmnesty. These were all bundled up\nand forwarded to the President of\nEthiopia, along with a message\ndemanding the release of the two\nprisoners. Within five weeks mother\nand child were set free. In a second\nexample, the President of Brazil was\nso distressed about Amnesty's campaign in Brazil that he vowed\nBrazil's human rights record would\nnever be cited again in future reports.\nClearly, the power of democracy can\nforce even the most ruthless regimes\ninto action.\nThere are several exciting events that\nhave started now which may interest\nyou. The \"Amnesty International\nChristmas Raffle 1996\" will take\nplace on the 20th December (1st prize \u00a33000, 2nd prize \u00a31500, 3rd prize \u00a3500 and loads of runner-up\nprizes of vouchers for Amnesty catalogue goods, videos, tapes and\nCD's). Amnesty International has long\nbeen associated with music well\nbefore the days of Live Aid.\nAmnesty, in collaboration with\nMiracle Music, has launched a com-petition, for budding songwriters.\nThere are two categories: firstly a song written on any theme and secondly a song specifically to do with\nhuman rights. The first prize in both\nsections is \u00a3200 and a publishing\ncontract, along with the use of a demo studio to record the song.\nSecond and third prizes are amounts\nto \u00a3100 and \u00a350 respectively plus a publishing contract. An ideal opportunity for you budding Noel\nGallaghers or Kurt Cobains to make\na positive statement.\nFinally if you are going to attend\nthe \"Skunk Anansie UK Tour 1996\"\nyou will probably see Amnesty\nstalls. Raffles will take place including a boogie box signed by the band.\nAMNESTY NEEDS YOU At the moment Amnesty is actively trying to recruit student members because\nthey are thought to be active and very passionate in support of causes. If you\nwish to become a member you can ring the hotline telephone number (0891\n445 999). Membership for students costs \u00a37.50 a year.\nTry out the following quiz to test your awareness of human rights:\n1. Human rights violations occur in all political ideologies.\n2. Torture is prohibited by the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\n3. Prisoners have been tortured in one out of every three countries during the\n90's.4. A17 year old can be executed in the US but not in Indonesia or Russia\n5. No innocent US citizens have been executed this century.\n6. In the USA, those who kill blacks are just as likely to be executed as those\nwho kill whites.\n7. No western industrialised nation apart from the US again uses the death\npenalty.\n8. Many citizens are silenced through \"disappearances\" by governments as a means of repression to avoid public criticism.\n9. Amnesty International works tirelessly for the release of all political pris\non ers regardless of beliefs or actions.\n10. Amnesty International got the Nobel Peace Prize for 1977 in supporting\nHuman rights.\nAnswers:\n3i ux(0 I3M Bd(63 tui(83 I ul( \u00a33S IB\nd(93si Bd(g3 nJ l(l7 on J x(e3n J l(3on J i(i "
