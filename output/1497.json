    "content": "SCIENCE\nFELIX\n10 Friday 14 october 2011\nEvery second each centimetre of the surface\nof the Earth is bombarded by 6\u00d71010\nsolar\nneutrinos \u2014 produced by nuclear fusion\nand the decay of isotopes such as beryl-lium-7. Writing in Physical Review Letters,\nan international collaboration of scientists\nhas announced the unprecedented accuracy\nof new solar neutrino data from the BOREXINO experiment at the Laboratori Nazionale del Gran Sasso, in central Italy.\nThe BOREXINO neutrino detector consists of a special organic liquid called a\nscintillator. When neutrinos collide with\nelectrons in the liquid at high velocity the\nelectrons start moving faster. These fast\nmoving electrons cause the scintillator to\nemit light, which is detected by the surrounding array of 2200 photomultiplier\ntubes. Since neutrinos are so weakly interacting \u2014 being only affected by gravity,\nwhich is insignificant at subatomic scales,\nand the weak nuclear force \u2014 they are very\ndifficult to detect and so a large mass of\nscintillator, approximately 278 metric tons,\nis required.\nA major problem with detecting neutrinos\nis background radiation. The BOREXINO\nteam solved this by building the detector\n1.4km beneath the Apennine Mountains.\nA thick layer of ultra-pure water surrounding the scintillator blocks any radiation that\nmakes it through the mountains.\nThis shielding has allowed the number\nof solar neutrinos from beryllium-7 decay\nreaching the detector to be measured with\nan unprecedented 5% uncertainty and has\nmade it possible for the first time to detect\nneutrinos with energies of under 1MeV.\nThe data collected has already provided\nevidence for the theory that neutrinos can\noscillate between their three \u2018flavours\u2019 \u2014\nelectron, muon and tau. This suggests that\nneutrinos have mass, which goes against\nthe Standard Model \u2014 the leading theory\nexplaining the subatomic world. The detector will also be used to explore the composition of the sun. Laura Cadonati, part\nof the collaboration and based at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, said:\n\u201cBOREXINO is the only detector capable\nof observing the entire spectrum of solar\nneutrinos at once.\nOur results, the culmination of 20 years\nof research, greatly narrow the observation\nprecision. The data confirm the neutrino\noscillations, flavour changes and flow predicted by models of the sun and particle\nphysics.\u201d\nThere also exists hope that the experiment\nmay yield some more unusual results, such\nas the discovery of a new flavour of neu-trino. Another University of Massachusetts\nmember of team, Andrea Pocar, has commented on this, saying, \u201cYou always have\nthe hope of seeing surprises, some small\ndeviation from the expectations. And this\nyou can only have if your accuracy and precision are good enough to see very small\nvariations.\u201d\nMaciej Matuszewski\nMeasuring solar neutrinos\nA scintillating view of the BOREXINO neutrino detector in Italy \u2013 top lads\nBlood sugar measured by lasers\nThe search for a non-invasive, effective\ntechnique with which to measure the blood\nsugar levels of diabetes sufferers has long\noccupied researchers in the medicine and\napplied biophysics communities. For the\nlast 20 years, research has centred on the\npotential use of wavelength-modulated laser\nradiometry \u2013 that is, shining lasers tuned to\nspecific wavelengths at human blood samples and measuring the response.\nNew research by Andreas Mandelis of\nthe University of Toronto has followed this\nblueprint but made some changes that may\nprove to be an innovative leap forward. The\nwavelength often used in past studies is in\nthe near-infrared, but Mandelis and team\nfocussed instead on differing wavelengths\nof mid-infrared light, utilised in two laser\nbeams simultaneously.\nThe method involved relies on the chemical bonds present in the glucose molecule.\nLaser light can pass harmlessly through\nlayers of human skin and interact with molecules present within human blood plasma.\nAs glucose molecular bonds are hit by laser light at certain frequencies they absorb\nenergy and vibrate, thus creating a measurable response. This glucose fingerprint is,\nhowever, quite tricky to isolate due to the\nvery nature of human blood; water is an\noverwhelmingly strong absorber of mid- to\nnear-infrared light, and blood is composed\nof approximately 92% water by volume.\nHowever, this did not stump Mandelis and\ncolleagues, who instead made use of this\nstrong wavelength dependency by tuning\ntwo laser beams to very slightly different\nwavelengths \u2014 one that is prone to absorption by both water and glucose, and one just\nby water. When both of these beams are\nfocussed on the jumble of molecules that\nmake up human blood, the water absorp-tions effectively cancel out and the returned\nsignal is solely due to glucose absorption.\nThis highlights the glucose levels within the\nblood and minimises the interference caused\nby water molecules.\nThis non-invasive and pain-free method\nhas shown great promise in being highly\nsensitive to even trace amounts of glucose\npresent in the test substance. However, there\nis a long way to go before the method can\nbe considered as tried and tested; so far the\nprocedure has only been trialled on samples\nof blood serum and sugar dissolved in wa-ter. Mandelis is currently working with colleagues at Toronto hospital to enable a testing programme involving human patients.\nThe team hope that their work may eventually lead to mass commercialisation of the\ntechnique for use in hospitals to continuously monitor diabetic patients, with the added\npotential for miniaturisation for use in the\nhome.\nThis may be very difficult to achieve; the\nnature of the work involved brings many\ninherent restrictions such as the size and sophistication of the lasers involved, the need\nfor personalisation to each patient before\nuse, and inevitable price limitations.\nIf, however, this were possible, it may\nlead to a greater in-depth understanding\nof diabetes itself. The ability of lasers to\ncontinuously measure blood sugar levels is\nhugely contrasting with the current method,\nwhich can only analyse samples of blood\ntaken at discrete time intervals.\nDespite the fact that such research is as\nyet unproven on human patients, the method\nshows greater promise than comparable past\nstudies. The frequency of research in this\narea reflects the importance of pioneering\na successful technique in order to fully understand the disease and aid its sufferers in\nthe future.\nMandelis and colleagues describe their research in full in an upcoming issue of Physical Review E.\nNicola Guttridge\nGenetic link for \u2018heavy\nheart\u2019 condition identified\nFollow the latest science news\nfrom Imperial and more on our\nFacebook page:\nfacebook.com/FelixScience\nLike us on Facebook\nFolk remedies for a heavy heart have ranged from\nwhite wine heated with red-hot steel to the flesh\nof a screech owl. But an Imperial-led international\nteam of scientists from Europe, the US, and Japan\nhave eschewed such treatments in tracking down\nthe gene that causes cardiac hypertrophy \u2013 literally,\na heavy heart, caused by a thickening of the walls of\nthe left ventricle. This condition often leads to heart\nfailure as the thick and stiffened heart muscles\nstruggle to pump blood around the body.\nThough cardiac hypertrophy was known to be a\nheritable trait, previous studies failed to pinpoint the\nrelevant gene associated with left ventricle mass.\nHowever, by taking advantage of recent advances\nin approaches to rat genetics, the team were able\nto identify the gene in question as endonuclease\nG, or Endog, a gene also known to be connected to\napoptosis, a form of generally benign cell death that\nplays a part in processes such as the differentiation of fingers and toes in embryos. As the authors\nput it, in a paper published this month in Nature,\nthe study \u201chas further established the link between\nmitochondrial dysfunction, reactive oxygen species\nand heart disease and has uncovered a role for Endog in maladaptive cardiac hypertrophy\u201d.\n\u201cWe found that a faulty copy of this gene causes\nthe heart to become thick and fatty, making it\n\u2018heavy\u2019 with poor function\u201d, says Professor Stuart\nCook from the Medical Research (MRC) Council\nClinical Sciences Centre at Imperial, who led the\nresearch. \u201cIt does this by interfering with the heart\ncells\u2019 energy source \u2013 the mitochondria. Like any\nother muscle in our body, the heart needs energy\nto keep it pumping. If the mitochondria don\u2019t work\nproperly, the heart struggles to make enough energy and the cells produce toxic by-products, called\nreactive oxidative species, which increase thickening of the heart wall.\u201d\nThe importance in knowing the gene behind the\ncondition is, of course, in the new potential this\ngives for tackling the cause rather than just the\nsymptom. \u201cWe can now start to investigate new\nways to develop treatments which target the mitochondria and toxic oxidative molecules.\u201d says Cook.\nThere\u2019s also an important wider lesson in the fact\nthat Endog was originally an unsuspected culprit \u2014\nso much of the genetic code remains uncharted ter-ritory. As Professor Amanda Fisher, Director of the\nMRC Clinical Sciences Centre, says \u201cThis discovery\nemphasises the importance of deciphering the genetic code of a broad range of mammals alongside\nthat of humans eventually to allow us explore new\navenues for better targeted drugs\u201d.\nDouglas Heaven\nScience Editors: Alexander Karapetian\nKelly Oakes\nscience.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n\n"

What NHS Reforms?\nWhat does it matter what I learnt here?\ndistilled into practical instruments. I\u2019ve\noften thought: \u201cI couldn\u2019t think this\nstuff up if I tried!\u201d I can\u2019t actually try\nnow, though, because I already know.\nBut I\u2019m pretty sure I couldn\u2019t.\nWhat I could do, however, is apply\nthese principles that I\u2019ve learnt else-where. When the plumber comes round I\ncould casually discuss the fluid dynamics of the house piping system, using my\nknowledge of cardiovascular physics.\nThen, having proved myself the AlphaMale of Intellect, I\u2019d also drop in details\nof the fluid dynamics OF MY URINE,\nwhich I spray round the house to mark\nmy territory because I\u2019m so alpha-male\nnow! Raaaaaar! I put Extra \u2018A\u2019s in that\nword, because I\u2019m so full of alpha.\nBut the feeling doesn\u2019t last long. Just\nwhen I feel like a genius, on top of The\nLearning, new lectures will add a new\nconsideration, requiring a new kink in\nthe ol\u2019 cortex. Tougher still is the more\nabstract stuff, the models and theories\nthat try to describe the unseen workings\nof the body. Ones that try to reverse-en-gineer the filigree clockwork of human\nphysiology, but are often left only able\nto observe and describe what we\u2019re unable to explain.\nLike a real scientists, as a student I\u2019ve\njust been trying to fit all sorts of disparate principles and observations into\na one-size-fits-all model that I can call\nmaybe-possibly true. Good enough to\nwork with for now. Sure, I\u2019ve tried to\nunderstand the incestuous web of interactions of our chemical messengers,\nor extrapolate chemical results to predict invisible mechanics. But mainly,\nI\u2019ve become familiar with the actual\nconcepts, besting them with study until\nthey can be used easily as tools of un-derstanding. What was a barrage of nonsense and unsatisfying mess in 1st year\nis (sometimes) par-for-the-course by the\nY\nou\u2019d think that when\nParliament was on the\nverge of passing a bill\nto effectively abolish the NHS it would\nbe front page news, but apparently\nnot. By the time you\u2019re reading this,\nthe House of Lords will have decided\nwhether or not to pass the 2011 Health\nand Social Care Bill. For both your\nsake and mine I hope they have not;\nhere\u2019s why.\nFirstly, the bill will eliminate the\nduty of the Secretary of State to provide free and comprehensive healthcare for British residents. That is to\nsay, the Government could, whenever\nit felt like it, stop giving money to the\nNHS, and they could either sell it or\nabolish it completely.\nSecondly, the Government would\nno longer be able to intervene if the\nNHS were to provide poor healthcare\nin a particular constituency. All this\nresponsibility would be shifted to an\nunelected combination of GPs and private companies. The NHS itself would\neffectively become a private company\nwith arbitrary Government subsidies.\nThirdly, any behaviour in the NHS\nthat is deemed anti-competitive (that\nis, unprofitable) must legally be\nstopped. This is all the more heinous\nsince the NHS was never intended to\nmake a profit, and it certainly doesn\u2019t\nmake a profit today. The entire NHS\ncould be abolished under this rule.\nFourthly, there would no longer be\na limit on the amount of profit a hospital can make from providing private\nhealthcare alongside free healthcare.\nThat is, there would be nothing to stop\nan NHS hospital charging money for\neverything and anything.\nHopefully these four issues are self-evidently problematic. Possibly more\nproblematic, however, has been the\npublic reaction to this bill. On Saturday and Sunday, I read from front to\nback my Dad\u2019s copies of The Times,\nand not once were the impending NHS\n5th year, sheathed and ready to use.\nI may not be able to discuss it casually over a Tetley with the plumber, but\nhaving once troublesomely navigated\ndown these twists of logic, I can now\nzoom round them with ease, perhaps\ndriving a new idea through and seeing\nhow it comes out. It\u2019s like the mental\nversion of muscle-memory.

The imprint of my learning will not just be in\nmy recollection of specific details or\nfacts, but in an appreciation of the subtleties of our reality, and the hard-earned\ntools of thought, swords of the psyche\nand\u2026 um, mallets of the mind that I\u2019ve\ncrafted to understand them.\nreforms mentioned.

    "content": "SCIENCE\nFELIX 11\nFriday 14 october 2011\nAre particles self aware?\nWe all think we know what Brownian motion is. It is the way physicists\ndescribe the motion of fluids like\nair and smoke in which the particles\nmoves about, seemingly at random,\nand diffuse throughout a volume.\nHowever, by looking at the microscopic scale where the particles in-teract, scientists have found a new\nphenomenon.\nFirstly there are two governing forces used to explain Brownian motion,\nwhich are ever competing for control.\nThe collisions with surrounding molecules transfer momentum and this is\nknown as \u2018thermal noise\u2019. Assumed\nto be random, it is characterized by\na white noise spectrum, which really means that the power (or in this\ncase collisions) contain equal strength\nwithin a fixed bandwidth about a centre frequency. In the white noise spectrum (shown right), there are random\npeaks over all frequencies without\nclear correlation.\nThe second force is the viscous\nfriction between the particles and\nthe solvent. In the case of smoke,\nas the smoke particles diffuse in the\nair, the higher the viscosity of air\nthe slower the smoke particles dif-fuse. The effect is one of damping\nthe motion, trying to slow down the\nparticles to rest. An experiment set\nup by Thomas Franosch, at the Institute for Theoretical Physics at the\nUniversity of Erlangen-Nuremberg\nin Germany, and his colleagues\nshows that it is possible to measure\nthe self-interaction of the particles\n\u2014 how they can interact to change\ntheir own motion.\nThe team trapped a colloid in liquid\nsuspension held in a laser trap to observe the effect of Brownian motion.\nThe sphere of solution was of the order of nanometres in size and when\nheld by the laser, can be modelled\nas a harmonic oscillator. It was previously considered that the viscous\nforce over-dampens the system and\nthe fluctuating motions are uncorrelated and constant at small frequen-cies. However, when you bring in\nthe idea of self-interaction, the fluctuations should change and correlate\nwith time.\nIn order to make the principle of\nself-interaction apparent, Franosch\nand his colleagues tune the harmonic\noscillator to its relaxation time. In a\ncolloid, the immersed particles will\neventually settle and the time it takes\nto reach this equilibrium position is\nthe relaxation time. As a laser was\nused to hold the trap, by varying the\npower of the laser, they could alter\nthe stiffness of the trap and effectively \u2018tune\u2019 the relaxation time.\nAdditionally, using the particle\u2019s\ndiameter and fluid\u2019s viscosity as pa-rameters, the diffusion time (the time\nto diffuse over the diameter) could\nbe tuned also. Franosch and his colleagues found that the optimum results were obtained from a melamine\nresin colloid, 3 micrometres in diam-eter, when immersed in acetone.\nThe result was a correlation between the fluctuations due to self-interaction and times. It soon became apparent of a hydrodynamic\n\u2018resonance\u2019 occurring close to the\nrelaxation frequency. The power\nspectral density increased and the\n\u2018white\u2019 noise became \u2018coloured\u2019 as\nthe peaks were not constant for all\nfrequencies.\nThe ramifications of this are re-markable; this is the first time experimental evidence has been found to\nsupport the theory of self-interaction\non these scales.\nIt has become clear that particles in\nsolutions are able to affect the result\nby their presence and hydrodynamic\nresonance can occur, changing the\npower spectrum.\nOne possible move for the future is\nto create more sensitive equipment,\nable to work at the micro- and nano-metre levels, to measure the shapes,\nsurfaces and distribution of small par-ticles, right down to biological cells.\nPavitar Devgon\nIn 2008, astronomers obtained the\nfirst direct visual evidence for a\n\u2018multiple exoplanetary system\u2019 \u2014 a\nsystem of planets orbiting one central\nstar that isn\u2019t our sun \u2014 using near-infrared ground-based images taken\nwith the W.M. Keck Observatory and\nthe Gemini North telescope. A fourth\nplanet orbiting the same star was revealed in 2010.\nExtrasolar planets, or exoplanets,\ncan be difficult for astronomers to\ndetect, partly because they are often\nso overwhelmed by the brightness\nof the star they orbit. The 2008 discovery of three exoplanets orbiting\na young star, HR8799 was made by\nChristian Marois of the National Research Council in Canada. However,\nit wasn\u2019t until a year later, when David Lafreniere of the University of\nMontreal reanalysed data originally\nrecorded back in 1998 by Hubble\u2019s\n\u2018Near Infrared Camera and Multi-Object Spectrometer\u2019 (NICMOS), that\nthe actual position of one of these exoplanets was identified. Where previously the central star had outshone\nthe planets surrounding it, Lafreniere\nused a library of images of reference\nstars to accurately strip away some of\nthis obscuring glow, confirming the\nexistence of the outermost one.\nNow, Remi Soummer of the Space\nTelescope Science Institute in Baltimore has taken this method one step\nfurther. By reanalysing the same\nHubble data as Lafreniere with even\nmore sophisticated software, and using over 460 images of reference\nstars taken from NICMOS\u2019s extensive decade-spanning library, Soummer\u2019s team have completely removed\nthe diffraction spikes from the image (an issue common for telescope-based image systems), boosted the\ncontrast, and dramatically reduced\nthe surrounding starlight, thus drawing the positions of the three previously elusive exoplanets out from the\nhaze.\nIn Marois\u2019 ground-based data,\nmeanwhile, the fourth orbiting exoplanet has been detected, which, at\n2.4 billion kilometres away from the\ncentral star, is too close for NICMOS\nto directly observe \u2014 it lies on the\nvery border of NICMOS\u2019s \u2018coronagraphic spot\u2019, a disc that aims to obscure most of the light from the central star to aid in observations of its\nsurroundings.\nThe combination of recent ground-based observations, such as those of\nMarois, and the much older Hubble\ndata from NICMOS, has proved extremely helpful to astronomers, as\nthe passage of time across the images\nmeans that the shape of the planets\u2019\norbits can be tracked. This in turn can\nprovide other valuable information\nthat is usually impossible to deduce\nfrom single images alone, such as the\nplanets\u2019 masses, eccentricities, and\nhow they interact with each other.\nThe three outer exoplanets have approximate orbit periods of between\n100 and 400 years, so observation\nover much longer timescales is needed to map and fully comprehend their\nmovements. However, a decade-sized \u2018head start\u2019 is still a great gift\nArianna Sorba\nThe white noise spectrum, random peaks over all frequencies without clear correlation... trippy, yo\nDecade old Hubble data reveals planets\nto astronomers studying this system,\nespecially as regards the innermost\nplanet, where a substantial amount of\nmotion can already be detected. \u2018It\u2019s\n10 years of science for free,\u2019 says\nSoummer.\nThe success of this new analysis,\nwhich is to be published in the Astrophysical Journal, has prompted\nSoummer\u2019s latest plan to reanalyse\nimages of approximately 400 other\nstars from the old NICMOS archive.\nFrom this his team will compile a\nlist of \u2018planetary candidates\u2019, which\nin turn will be verified by ground-based telescope observations, much\nthe same as how has occurred with\nthe planets orbitting HR8799. Thus\nthe re-examination of archive data\ncould produce a wealth of new discoveries of these elusive exoplanets.\n\u201cEvidence has been\nfound to support the\ntheory of self interaction on these scales\u201d\n\n"

    "content": "POLITICS\nFELIX 15\nFRIDAY 14 October 2011\nPoles at the Polls\nA radical libertarian party could hold\nthe key to power in Poland after Sunday, when the EU\u2019s sixth largest economy and only country not to contract\nin 2009 held parliamentary elections.\nUnsurprisingly, the incumbent centrist\nPM came out on top; Donald Tusk\u2019s\nCivic Platform won 39.2% \u2013 a slight\ndecline from the 41.5% gained in 2007.\nThe main opposition, the right wing\nLaw and Justice, gained 29.9% \u2013 also\na small reduction from 32.1% in 2007.\nHowever, the newly formed breakaway\nfrom Tusk\u2019s party, Palikot\u2019s Movement,\ngained support from 10.2% of Poland\n(including myself), making it the third\nmost popular party.\nThe party is now one of the most\nRadical Liberals look set to be incumbent\u2019s kingmaker\nPiotr Faba radical liberal parliamentary parties in\nthe EU \u2013 supporting full separation of\nchurch and state, legalisation of abortion and marijuana, and removal of the\nSenate (upper house). The result is a\nsurprise; particularly in strongly Catholic Poland. And with no majority party,\nJanusz Palikot may now have the influence of a kingmaker.\nWith the economy doing well compared with other EU countries and a\nsense of progress in Poland, voters did\nnot make this decision as an act of rebellion against an unpopular adminis-tration. I was also surprised to find their\nmain voter base was not just students.\nExit polls showed 18.6 % were students,\nwhile 37.5% were over 40. The bias towards the young, urban and educated is\nnot as great as one might imagine.\nThis reflects a changing attitude\nthroughout Polish society. The Roman\nCatholic Church, until very recently,\nhad a great deal of influence in the newly democratic Poland; they are credited,\nunder Polish Pope John Paul II, with\nhelping bring about the fall of commu-nism. However, in recent years there has\nbeen a sense that this is no longer appro-priate. The importance of the church has\nmade it rather taboo to openly support\nanti-clerical policies. However, with a\nclosed box election and a radical party\non the vote slip, many Poles showed\ntheir true beliefs.\nIt should not necessarily be assumed\nthat this is a growing atheist movement.\nFor instance, I still attend Church because the spiritual experience is still\nimportant to me in my everyday life.\nHowever, I do not feel that the church\nas an institution should be interfering\nwith any aspect of how the country is\nrun.\nRecently, many Poles had been looking at models followed by other Catholic, but more liberal, European coun-tries, such as France, Italy and Spain.\nNow, with Palikot\u2019s increasing popular-ity, Poland could soon be the leader for\nother European liberals to follow.\nIf you\u2019re looking at this page and\nthinking that writing about the latest\npolitical developments from across\nthe globe is right up your street, then\nyou might just want to be a Politics\nReporter. If you\u2019re interested, get\nin touch with the Politics Editors at\npolitics.felix@imperial.ac.uk.\nThe media\u2019s inevitable right wing slant\nJakov Marelic provides his view on media politics in the modern world\nW\ne live in democracies\nwhere we hold those\nin power to account\nusing elections. To\nhelp us make informed choices about our society there\nare many kinds of media on the market\nwhose job it is to tell us all the bad stuff\nand to suggest solutions to them. The\nidea is that this will build a public support base, which will propel a good representative to electoral victory and kick\nout bad representatives.\nNow then, media channels (newspa-pers, magazines, radio, television, jour-nals, etc.) compete with each other for\ncustomers; media that does well (at keeping us informed) will be rewarded with\nmoney and can expand. Media providers\nwho do badly will decline in favour and\nbe punished by bankruptcy. This competition keeps quality high, costs low and\nincompetent providers out of the system.\nThis is how it works, right? Wrong.\nWhat I\u2019ve just described is the free\nmarket of media companies and a good\nrule of thumb for free markets is that\npeople are not equal but those with the\nmost money have the most power. Because of this, media operating in a free\nmarket will always bias against the interests of the political left and the lower\nclasses. Let me explain why.\nThe argument commonly goes, \u201cIf\npeople didn\u2019t like this or that media\nthey would stop buying it\u201d. Apart from\nthe fact that this could be used to justify\nthe USSR totalitarian-controlled media\n(since back then Russians also bought\nand consumed it) it actually turns out\nthe public have very little say in what\nthe press offers to them because newspapers do not get most of their income\nfrom sales.\nYou may notice that the price you pay\nfor each newspaper is minuscule. The\ncost of The Sun newspaper is 20 pence.\nThis doesn\u2019t even cover the ink! Same\nholds for television and radio where\nthere is zero income from the consumer.\nNewspapers and other media actually get\ntheir money from corporate advertisers.\nThe media generally cannot run stories\nthat offend corporations because sponsors will threaten to pull their advertising money. In 1980, the liberal staff at\nthe Mother Jones magazine debated over\nwhether or not to publish a series of articles linking cigarettes to cancer. The\neditors knew that the tobacco industry\nwould punish them by canceling their lucrative advertising contracts, which the\nyoung, struggling magazine desperately\nneeded. Mother Jones stuck to its principles and printed the articles anyway; and,\njust as expected, the tobacco companies\nangrily pulled their ads.\nA few months ago we saw anti-tax\nevading protests in Britain and America.\nThe US Uncut group, for example, protested against the American company\nGeneral Electric which hasn\u2019t paid a single cent in taxes to the US government\nsince 2006, despite making over $26 billion in profits. The same General Electric\nalso owns MSNBC, usually a centre-left\nchannel that would oppose corporate\nwelfare, yet on this instance they were\ncritical of US Uncut.\nAdvertisers also want their adverts to\nbe viewed by people who have money to\nspend buying their products. This automatically discriminates against any media with a predominantly working class\nreadership.\nBetween 1912 and 1964 there existed a\nBritish newspaper called the Daily Herald. At one point its politics were broadly\nsyndicalist: it gave unconditional support to strikers and argued for a socialist revolution based on worker\u2019s self-organisation in trade unions. It also gave\nstrong support to suffragettes and to anti-colonial struggles, especially in Ireland.\nEarly issues dealt with the loss of the\nRMS Titanic, emphasizing the disproportionate loss of life among crew members and poor third-class passengers.\nIn 1933 the Herald became the world\u2019s\nbest-selling daily newspaper, with certified net sales of 2 million. Even when\nit closed down in 1964 it was probably\namong the 20 largest circulation dailies\nin the world, this meant it was selling\nfar more than The Times, the Guardian\nand the Financial Times put together. It\ndidn\u2019t die because there wasn\u2019t enough\ndemand for it, it died because the paper\u2019s\npredominantly poor readership was not a\nworthwhile target for advertisers.\nThis system explains why in our time,\nthe centre-left Guardian and Independent\nare struggling financially and the centre-right Daily Telegraph, Daily Mail, and\nThe Times are in rude health.\nIt should not be surprising that these\nadvertising and media companies, like\nmost big businesses, are extremely con-servative. They have certain agendas:\nthey desire lower taxes, fewer lawsuits\nfrom the public, fewer environmental re-straints, better public relations (a euphemism for less public exposure to scan-dals), higher profits and more effective\nlobbying power in government. Controlling public opinion would give them all\nthese things.\n10.2%! It bring\u2019s a tear to my eye. Where\u2019s my hanky?\nRajat Jain\n\u201cThe Catholic Church,\nuntil very recently,\nhad a great deal of\ninfluence in Poland\u201d\n\u201cThe public has very\nlittle say in what the\npress offers them\u201d\n\n"

This week, Fencing Men\u2019s 1st\nteam captain Didier Nohlmans inaugurates our Club Captains interview se-ries. A member of the team that swept to\nBUCS championship gold last season,\nhe acknowledges that he has pretty big\nshoes to fill:\n\u201cLast year was indeed a very successful year for Imperial fencing, with both\nthe men\u2019s and women\u2019s team becoming BUCS champions, so I have a lot to\nlive up to. The start of the year has been\nhectic as usual with lots of new fencers-both beginners and more experienced\nones.\u201d\nThe club is indeed a big one, attracting\na lot of interest from freshers (over 200\nsigned up for taster sessions at freshers\u2019\nfair), and while everyone helps out, the\ncaptain does have the time to focus on\nthe competitive side of things: \u201cmost of\nthe organisational work is done by our\npresident, Ed Collier, so my main responsibility so far has been picking this\nyear\u2019s first team.\u201d\nIn order to do this, tryouts were organized last Wednesday. What is the ver-dict? Can this year\u2019s team emulate its\npredecessors and become BUCS cham-pions?\n\u201cSeveral key first team members from\nlast year have sadly graduated, so we\nwere in desperate need of some new\nfencers. Luckily, there was plenty of\ntalent at the trials so I\u2019m confident that\nwe\u2019ll have a great team and a good year.\nWhether we can reproduce last year\u2019s\nsuccess remains to be seen, as it also depends on whether our opposition have\nimproved - but for now I\u2019m going to say\nthat we definitely have the potential to\nbecome champions again.\u201d\nIn any case, he still has time to fine-tune his team and get them fully prepared for the matches: \u201cThe fencing\nseason for the first team starts in Oxford\nin November with a round-robin tournament in the southern premier league\n(Cambridge, Oxford, Bristol and ULU).\nAnother round-robin tournament is held\nin January here at Imperial against the\nsame opposition.\u201d\n\u201cAfter this, all teams progress through\nto the national knockout stages where\nwe could come up against anyone as far\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8\n9 10 10\n11 12 13\n13 14 15 15 16\n17 18 18 19 19 20\n21\n20 21 22 23 24\n24 26 25 27\n26 29\n11 12 15\n16 17 18 19 20\n21\n22 23 24 25\n26 23\n25\n28\n22\n17\n17\n14\n16\nClub Captain Interview:\nMen\u2019s Fencing\nIndy Leclercq awvay as St Andrews.\u201d\nI ask him what he hopes to achieve,\nand the answer is pretty clear: \u201cAll of\nthis culminates in the national BUCS\nfinals, which we are certainly hoping to\nbe at!\u201d\nIn order to get that far, the team is going to have to train hard, on top of the\ntwice-weekly sessions organized by\nthe Fencing club. According to Didier,\n\u201ca lot of our team members also train\nat clubs outside Imperial to build up\nmore experience against different opponents.\u201d\nSo the objective is fixed, and the date\nof the BUCS finals firmly penciled into\nthis captain\u2019s calendar. But come on -we want to find out a bit about the people behind the trophies, don\u2019t we?\n\u201cI\u2019m a physics PhD student, working\nin the labs down in the depths of the\nphysics building. I came here a year ago\nand before that I was at Durham for my\nundergrad.\u201d\nAll right, sounds fair, anything else? I\nask him how he got into fencing, and it\nturns out there is a bit of a story in there:\n\u201cI used to play football at school, but\nwhen I was 13 I had an operation on my\ntoe and couldn\u2019t play for a few weeks,\nso I thought I\u2019d give fencing a go in-stead. I\u2019ve never looked back since!\u201d\nDidier is a sabreur, which means he\nfences with a sabre, one of three different fencing weapons. While they each\nhave their own characteristics, and none\nis truly \u201cstronger\u201d than the other two,\nthere is a fair bit of banter between practitioners of the different weapons [Editor\u2019s note - as a foilist, sabre just seems\nto me like two people crashing into each\nother with their swords - totally unre-fined] I ask him why he got into sabre\nrather than ep\u00e9e or foil, the other two\nweapons.\n\u201cQuite simple...all my friends were\ndoing it. I was lucky enough to be at a\nschool where the training for sabre was\nparticularly good so it was a natural\nchoice for me.\u201d\nAh, good old peer pressure. Well, it\nmeans ICFC have a great sabreur and\ncompetent captain amongst them this\nseason, so it\u2019s not all bad.\nAny last thoughts before letting the\ngood students carry on with their Friday\npint?\n\u201cActually, when I was captain of the\nDurham fencing team, we came down\nto fence Imperial for the BUCS quarter finals and got thoroughly destroyed.\nLuckily I\u2019ve now changed allegiances!\u201d\nRightly so. Come on Imperial!\n...for now, I\u2019m going\nto say that we\ndefinitely have the\npotential to become\nchampions again\nEssential info:\nDidier Nohlmans, 23\nRight-handed\n10 years\u2019 experience of fencing sabre\nPhysics PhD student\nLikes: lasers, winning BUCS gold\nDislikes: team members that don\u2019t\nturn up for training\nSports Editor\nIC Fencing are sponsored by:\n\n"

    "content": "FEATURE\n9\nFELIX Friday 14 october 2011\nInterview: Eliza Manningham-Buller\nMatt Colvin talks to the former MI5 Director General and current College Chairman about her role and the future of Imperial College\nFeatures Editors: Katy Bettany\nStephen Smith\nfeatures.felix@gmail.com\nL\nate September \u2013 it\u2019s the\nweek before the beginning\nof a new academic year. As\na new intake of students\nprepare to acclimatise to\ntheir new surroundings, a more experienced senior member of staff is also\npreparing for the hardships of the year\nahead, as one should expect from someone in charge of the long and arduous\nprocess of appointing the Rector. Sitting across a table from someone with\nsuch a varied career (teacher, Director\nGeneral of MI5, attendee to the House\nof Lords) is at least a little intimidating\nto begin with, especially since I have no\nidea of the manner in which to address\na Baroness. Baroness Eliza Manningham-Buller is keen to do away with any\nsuch preconceptions almost instantly.\n\u201cIt\u2019s just Eliza,\u201d she tells me as we are\nintroduced.\nEliza chairs the Council of Imperial\nCollege London, following on from her\npredecessor Lord Kerr. She took up the\npost on July 16 and is the first woman\nto hold the position of College Chairman. She is not entirely new to Imperial, having been Deputy Chairman since\n2009. Sitting in her office in the Faculty\nBuilding, I aim to discover what her\nrole, and that of the College Council\nitself, entails.\n\u201cMost students probably don\u2019t know\nthat it exists,\u201d Eliza begins; a perceived\nwrong that she is without a doubt keen\nto right. With responsibilities extending\nfar beyond the appointment of the Rector, including advising on College strat-egy, finance and property, the Council\nis not the sole responsibility of one, but\nmany.\n\u201cThe Council is made up of several\nindividuals from different walks of\nlife, including business, investment,\nthe Civil Service and management,\u201d\nexplains Eliza \u2013 it\u2019s a list that includes\nkey figures from institutions such as the\nBank of England and companies such\nas BP.\nIt is also a list that ultimately decides\nupon who will take charge of the Council, a process that Eliza doesn\u2019t hesitate\nto explain when asked about the path\nshe took to the position of Council\nChairman: \u201cI applied through a formal\nAt the Council\u2019s heart, Eliza explains\nthat it is their role to \u201chelp Imperial be\neven better\u201d. \u201cUniversities can\u2019t be stat-ic. The global world is changing, so students are going to go, if they can afford\nit. There should be no complacency;\nwe must continually seek to improve\neverything, as it\u2019s a competitive world\nand people should be getting their money\u2019s worth. Complacency will mean our\ndownfall.\u201d\nIt comes as no surprise that Eliza is\nstill very much in demand by various\ninstitutions, and not only Imperial. Intrigued as to how she simply finds the\ntime to fulfil all of her responsibilities,\nincluding sitting in the House of Lords\nand acting as a governor with the Wellcome Trust charity, she proceeds to lift\nthe veil on what was increasingly looking like a professional juggling act:\n\u201cThe Wellcome Trust takes about 60\ndays of the year. At Imperial, I found\nthe exposure to high-grade sciences and\nresearch fascinating, so I had no hesitation in joining the Council. In the House\nof Lords I chair one committee while\nsitting on two, and yet I still get time to\nsee my sheep! \u201d\nered against the impending rise in fees\n\u2013 something that Eliza assures will be\nconsidered with due attention. \u201cWe\nneed to monitor the situation carefully\nand collect statistics on it. There\u2019s no\npoint asserting that it\u2019s all fine.\u201d In a\nsimilar vein, she is particularly keen to\nhighlight the benefits of Imperial\u2019s new\nbursary scheme, with up to a significant\n\u00a360,000 worth of support propelling\nthe university to the top of the Russell\nGroup in terms of financial aid available to students. \u201cFinancial support\nand alumni contribution is a keen area\nas it can help the students, strengthen\nfinances and aid ailing infrastructure,\u201d\nshe explains, \u201cIt\u2019s a big, long term job.\u201d\n\u201cThere are lots of external challenges,\nbut equally we\u2019re constantly seeking\nto be better \u2013 it\u2019s a competitive world.\nWe\u2019re going to become pretty vocifer-ous, after all, we\u2019re educating the next\ngeneration of doctors, scientists, engineers and business leaders.\u201d\nReaching the end of our discussion,\nwe move to Eliza\u2019s background as an\nOxford arts student, in particular asking whether she has any regrets not\nreading science. \u201cI loved Biology at\nschool,\u201d she admits, \u201cthough my experience of science teaching was that it\nwas designed to put off all but the most\npassionate \u2013 it was all petri dishes and\nBunsen burners; I never understood that\nscience was about discovery \u2013 now, it\nexcites me to no end!\u201d\nprocess after replying to an advertisement in The Economist, so in addition,\nthere were external applicants. I was\ninterviewed by a subset of Council\nmembers, and then a recommendation\nfollowed.\u201d Despite her current position,\nshe also mentions that it wasn\u2019t something that she actively sought once she\noriginally joined the College, explain-ing, \u201cI never expected to seek [the posi-tion] when I joined.\u201d\nDespite the already substantial credentials of the Council in its entirety,\nEliza is keen to appoint some new people to be more representative of society\nin its diversity: individuals \u201cwith international experience and cultural understanding.\u201d Such experience is naturally\ncrucial towards the appointment of the\nRector, a process involving \u201cdrawing\nup a job specification and headhunting\nthrough an open process,\u201d advising that\nfor an ideal candidate, \u2018it\u2019s central to be\napproachable to students.\u201d\n\u201cI never understood\nthat science was\nabout discovery \u2013\nnow, it excites me to\nno end!\u201d\nWhile others may still seek her ad-vice, Eliza hopes to reaffirm new\nbonds with Imperial College Union, \u201cI\nhope to keep in touch with the [Union]\nPresident outside of Council meetings \u2013\nwithout a doubt there are voices to be\nheard.\u201d When I ask about Imperial\u2019s latest rankings in university league tables,\nwith the Sunday Times dropping Imperial 11 places last month, she is quick\nto assure me that \u201c[league tables] can\nbe quite misleading. The real question\nwe have to ask ourselves is: are we as\ngood as we want to be? The answer will\nalmost always be no, therefore we will\nalmost always want to be better.\u201d\nIt\u2019s a question that must be consid-Baronness Eliza Manningham-Buller\n\u201cThere should be\nno complacency;\nwe must continually\nseek to improve everything\u201d\nDo you love to\nwrite?\nWhy not write\na FEATURE?\nEmail us to\nget involved.\nImperial College London\n\n"

I\nmean who could argue with taking those hazy childhood memories of gaming, and sprucing them up to\npreen and perform for modern gamers?\nWho could argue with dispatching a new group of\ngamers to fell Shadow of the Colossus\u2019 titular titans,\nand feel the guilt afterwards? Or with recruiting new\nthumbs to pilot anArwing in Starfox 64 3D, listening\nto the radio-chatter hubbub of gaming\u2019s most iconic\nsound bites?\n\u201cI guess I should be thankful!\u201d\nAnd I guess I should be especially thankful for the\nsuper-effective, special attack justification for this remake craze: who could argue with a new set of men\nbecoming boys again, and taking those daunting ba-by-steps into the expanse of Hyrule field in Ocarina\nof Time 3D?\n@FelixGames on\nTwitter\nExtra polygons are always good - or are they?\n\u201cThe enemies in Quake\nare rendered with a jerky,\nstaccato energy, as if\nfighting in strobe lighting\u201d\nI mean, did you see the new trees in Kokiri Forest?!All individually rendered in loving detail? What\nthe hell had happened to the low-res, is-that-serious-ly-meant-to-be-a-tree trees that used to surround the\nforest? Their endlessly repeating texture of vaguely\nwood-y colours suggested deep forest more than any\namount of crafted polygons ever could. And don\u2019t\nget me started on the hyper-warm colours in the trail-ers.\nToo late! You just did with your revolting look of\nconfusion.\nSeriously, what were those new Hyper-warm\ncolours? Was this Hyrule-Del-Sol or something?\nWhere was my earthy-toned, muddy Hyrule, and\nwhat was this flashy imposter with its cheap greens\nand golden hues?!\nSo the trailers got me worked up. And thinking.\nAnd what I thought was: By Golly! (because that is\nhow thoughts think) there are a lot of types of re-make, and most are very good, but maybe some of\nthem lose something in translation. Even more interesting (By Golly Gosh!) was the idea that maybe,\nsometimes, there were some stylistic advantages to\nthe old limitations on graphic and sound.\nThink about it (What ho!): What was originally a\nnecessity, of using pixelated graphics and 8-bit chip-tunes, has now been embraced as part of the gaming\naesthetic. Many games, from Minecraft to Megaman\n9, relish the unique power of using pixels as their\nbrush strokes or blips and bleeps as their soundtrack.\nSo is shinier and spanglier always better? This being Imperial, we must experiment. As I mentioned\nearlier, I will use the power of writing to REVERSE\nTIME ITSELF.\nBy doing this I will (single-handedly) transform\nthe gaming landscape from one endlessly striving\ntowards realism and simulation, to one that starts\noff realistic and suddenly embraces the abstract. The\nslowdown, the short draw-distances and square poly-gons. We\u2019ll pretend it\u2019s like fine art, starting off all\nobsessed with fabrics and shadows and portraits and\nlandscapes, before being forced by photography into\na kaleidoscope of creativity. Surrealism, impression-ism, and all those other-isms.\nWe\u2019ll pretend, just as a null hypothesis type thing,\nthat even if Miyamoto had the choice of 3D-high-resolution, bump-mapped, bloom-lit powers when\nhe invented Mario, or Toby Gard had the access to\nperformance-capture, anti-aliasing, motion-con-trolled know-how when he made Tomb Raider, that\nthey\u2019d still choose to make them just as they did.\nI hope to choose a game or two every week, often\nones that\u2019ve since been remade or refined, and see\nif any of its retro chic can beat any of our modern\nshine.\nLet\u2019s reverse time and see what we find!\nSince id\u2019s success with Quake 4, it has produced 3\nsequels including the trigger-happy Quake 3, and a\ntrue strogg-and-sci-fi sequel Quake 2. But it\u2019s in its\nlatest incarnation (trendily called just \u2018Quake\u2019) that\nthe series has found the eeriness and atmosphere\nit has always strived for. id has eschewed the steel\nwalls and electric doors of Quake 4 and its sequel\ntoo, instead opting for a uniquely baroque hybrid of\nOmar Hafeez-Bore on why old games get better when you pretend they\u2019re new\ngothic architecture, thunderous guns and grotesque\nfantasy monstrosities.\nIts masterstroke of horror however is in reducing\nthe amount of frames of animation used. Instead of\nthe fluid and familiar advances of Quake 4\u2019s enemies,\nthe ones in Quake are rendered with a jerky, staccato\nenergy, as if fighting in strobe lighting. Funny as it\nmay sound, it actually gives the gunplay a brutal immediacy of impact, and the already ghoulish designs\nthe unnerving, alien rhythm of a Ray Harryhuasen\nstop motion effect.\nQuality reduction - id\u2019s design masterstroke\nLaurence Pope\nMinecraft: so much more than just Lego for nerds\nQuake: Playing them in\nreverse\nYesterday one of my friends asked me \u2013 what\u2019s the\ndeal with Minecraft? I tried to explain it to them,\nbut to no avail. So here\u2019s try two \u2013 in print form.\nMaybe I\u2019ll enlighten this time around\u2026\nIt\u2019s easy to say what Minecraft (by developers\nMojang) is \u2013 an open-world sandbox game with\nno goal in mind other than what you set yourself.\nYou\u2019re dumped into the middle of the cube-based\nworld most people are familiar with and bam, that\u2019s\nit, do what you want.\nWhat\u2019s the fun in that I hear you ask? The problem\nis, most people don\u2019t realise just how complicated\nthe world presented to you is. Yes, the graphics are\nwhat you\u2019d call retro, but in keeping with what\nOmar said above me retro isn\u2019t always a bad thing.\nA world of true complexity lies hidden beneath the\nsimplicity of the blocky textures presented to you.\nThe thrill (seriously) is in creation and devel-opment. You start from the bare basics, a small\nwooden hut or a hollowed-out rock face in order to\nsurvive the first night, when all manner of zombies\nand skeletons come out to attack. From there you\ncan gather more and more exotic materials \u2013 coal,\niron, gold and diamonds to name a few \u2013 by delving into the virtual earth, all the while avoiding the\nperils of lava flows and dungeon-dwelling beasties.\nAs your building grows in grandeur you can start to\nutilize the more complicated and subtle aspects behind the game, including power switches, pistons\nand automatic minecart tracks. This is the wealth\nof complexity concealed beneath the simple de-sign, and it\u2019s discovering that immense untapped\npotential that keeps me, at least, playing on to find\nthem.\nYou only have to look on YouTube to find a wealth\nof inventive creations \u2013 pinball machines, elaborate traps, timed explosives, waterfall lifts, music\ndevices that play Bohemian Rhapsody...the list is\neffectively endless. With regular updates come\nmore tools to create and more inventive ways to\nmuck about in your own private universe.\nSo what are you waiting for? Get playing, and\nwatch out for my most probably ill-fated Minecraft\nhow-to in future issues.\nOr, you know, just go back to Lego.\nNote: not in-game footage\nThere is nothing as tense as seeing one of Quake\u2019s\nhuge Shamblers crashing across a hallway in jud-dered strides, nothing as vicious as a possessed\nknight swinging his sword in the few frames of his\nfrenzied swing, and nothing better as message from\nid to the rest of the FPS competition; that in this day\nof motion-capture and self-indulgent animations,\nless can still be more.\nFELIX Friday 14 OCTOBER 2011 33\nGames Editor: Laurence Pope\ngames.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n\n"

For the past seven years, Babar Ahmad\nhas been in prison fighting extradition to the\nUnited States. The current petition, launched\ntwo months ago, calls on the UK Government\nto put him on trial in the UK.\nBabar Ahmad, a British citizen, studied engineering as an undergraduate at Imperial, before\nmoving on to an IT support role at the college.\nIn 2003, he was arrested under UK anti-terror\nlegislation, but released after six days without\ncharge. During his brief time in prison he sustained multiple injuries from the officers who\nheld him in custody. A year later, the United\nStates filed a request for his extradition (under\nthe controversial Extradition Act 2003) and he\nwas re-arrested. Since then, he has remained in\nprison, challenging his impending extradition\nto the US.\nBabar Ahmad\u2019s sister Amna fears that if he\nis extradited to the US, he will face a life in\nsolitary confinement in a maximum-security\nprison. She says he wants to be tried in Britain\nas a British citizen and \u201cdoes not understand\nwhy he needs to go to the US\u201d. Amna believes\nthat once the UK authorities realized they\ncould not prosecute Babar, they asked the US\nto initiate proceedings against him instead. She\nclaims the reason for this is that if Babar was\ntried in the UK, \u201cit would expose embarrassing details of the way the Police treated him \u2026\nand collusion between UK and US authorities\nin relation to his case\u201d.\ning to provide evidence (there is no reciprocal\narrangement for the UK to extradite American\ncitizens).\nAmna Ahmad argues that \u201cextradition is for\nfugitives who commit a crime in one country\nand run away to another country. [Babar Ahmad] has never lived or worked in the US, and\neven the US acknowledges that all the allegations against him took place whilst he was living and working in the UK. If the material was\ncollected from the UK and the alleged offences\nare said to have occurred in the UK then he\nshould face trial in the UK, in front of a jury\nof his peers.\u201d\nBabar Ahmad\u2019s supporters have launched a\npetition, urging the Government to allow him\nto stand trial in the UK. So far, the petition\nhas received 23,000 signatures. If this number\nreaches 100,000, the Government is required\nto debate it in Parliament. Amna says \u201cit will\nsend a strong signal to the British Government\n\u2026 that there is sufficient public support behind\nour quest.\u201d However, given the Government\u2019s\nreluctance so far to compromise on the issue,\nthe outcome of such a debate remains doubtful.\nNevertheless, Amna is closely involved\nwith the Free Babar Ahmad Campaign and\nis actively engaged in promoting the online\npetition. She believes it is \u201cshocking that our\nGovernment can hold a man without trial for\nover 7 years\u201d and that \u201cuncertainty of fate is\na very difficult thing for any human being to\ndeal with\u201d.\nLinks to the petition and more information\non Babar Ahmad\u2019s case can be found at http://\nwww.freebabarahmad.com/\nBabar Ahmad \u2018should face\ntrial in the UK\u2019, says sister\nOnline petition aims to bring matter to Parliament debate\nAemun Reza\nThis year\u2019s Silfest committee\nJack Hewitt\nflickr/s_falkow\nAmna Ahmad claims that a UK based trial would \u2018expose\u2019 details of police treatment\nNavid Nabijou\nJezebel, fire engine and mascot of the Royal College\nof Science Union, has now reached 50,000 miles\non the clock.\nJezebel is a 1916 Dennis N type fire engine with\na 1926 pump. The Royal College of Science Motor\nClub (RCS Motor Club), consisting of past and current students, have been undertaking maintenance\nand repair of Jezebel since 1955 including an engine rebuild in 2000 and repainting in 2004. She is\nused on various college occasions including balls,\ncharity events and even a former Union President\u2019s\nwedding.\nAccording to RCS Motor Club, Jezebel is \u201cdesigned to do one thousand miles a year\u201d with the oil\nrequiring changing every 500 miles. She is thought\nto have exceeded 50,000 miles whilst in Imperial\u2019s\nhands alone, despite the mileage reading on the\nclock. Despite this, the figures mark a symbolic moment in Jezebel\u2019s history.\nAlex Nowbar\nFire engine Jezebel clocks up\n50,000 miles\nBabar Ahmad:\nThe story so far\nDecember 2003\nAugust 2004\nJanuary 2007\nAugust 2011\n10 November 2011\nBabar Ahmad arrested on UK terrorism charges. He is released six days\nlater.\nRe-arrested to be extradited to the\nUS.\nEuropean Court of Human Rights\nintervenes at last moment to freeze\nextraditial proceedings.\nOnline petition started.\nPetition due to close.\nBabar Ahmad\u2019s case is just one episode in a\ntale that has lasted over a decade. In the years\nsince the 9/11 attacks, a slew of anti-terror\nlegislation has been passed into law, by Governments both here and in the US. Particularly\ncontroversial elements of this legislation include the authorisation to make arrests without\nevidence, to detain people indefinitely without\ncharge and to use extreme methods of torture\nto obtain information.\nMany argue that resorting to such illiberal\nmeasures undermines the fundamental values\nof our free society. One of these is the principle\nof sovereignty: that a country cannot charge a\nforeign national with an offence committed on\nforeign soil, and it is in this respect that Babar\nAhmad\u2019s case is unusual. The Extradition Act\n2003 allows the US to extradite British citizens\nfor crimes committed in Britain, without hav\u201cHe should face trial in\nfront of his peers\u201d\n\n"

On the basis of that description alone I realised that my attendance\nwas inevitable. Nothing however could have\nprepared me for the breathtakingly energetic,\nshockingly beautiful dance I witnessed. The\nshow featured extracts from Two Theories and\nDrastic-Classicism both groundbreaking, iconoclastic works from the Director. Armitage\u2019s\nchoreography subverts classical ballet through\nmodern and street influences to create some of\nthe most visceral, thrilling, yet technically immaculate dance I have ever seen.\nWhen I discovered that an Armitage production was scheduled at Imperial College later in\nthe week I grabbed my chance and was kindly\noffered an impromptu interview after the show.\nMeredith Thomas: I understand you have\nbeen in this game for a while.\nKarole Armitage: I have. I actually I started\ndancing when I was four. I was first a ballet\ndancer. I danced with George Balanchine who\nis kind of the Shakespeare of ballet and with\nMerce Cunningham who was a very important\nforce in modern dance. During the time I was\nwith Merce Cunningham in the late 70s punk\nhit and I became very interested in combining punk and raw influences with my masters.\nI did a piece that became very famous called\nDrastic-Classicism for guitars and drums with\nmusic by Rhys Chatham. It was the first time a\nreal rock, raw-spirit was combined with Ballet\nrefinement and it created a revolution. I think\nthat\u2019s the perfect title for my work to this day...\nDrastic-Classicism.\nMT: Was that an idea that came to you im-mediately?\nKA: It just came. These two kinds of dance\nwere enemies. They were absolute enemies and\neven to this day there is still a lot of animosity...\nwhen I say those two kinds of dance I mean\nballet and modern... let alone punk. Ballet and\nModern had different philosophies and they\ndid not like each other. But I liked both and I\nput them together to create a new language of\ndance and then added in this kind of rock... the\nraw rock emotional side and that launched my\ncareer as a chorographer. Then I worked for\npeople like Madonna and Michael Jackson and\nI choreographed Hair. But my heart really lies\nin innovative stage dance.\nMT: I got the feeling form the second half of\nthe performance that you were someone who\nhad been to a lot of punk gigs and knew how\ntiring and energetic that was.\nKA: I did in the late 70s. I was living in New\nYork though I was in London quite frequently\nat that time. Micheal Clarke was a great friend;\nactually he was in Drastic-Classicism. We met,\nwe hit it off... he became my partner and we\nperformed together. I was in London a lot and\nso I went to a lot of Punk gigs here. In New\nYork I went almost every night, although I\nwas dancing all day. I didn\u2019t need sleep I don\u2019t\nknow how really but the energy was just so ex-citing. I wasn\u2019t trying to imitate punk I was just\nusing it as spice... a flavour.\nMT: And that\u2019s the punk side. What about the\nscience...\nKA: I have always been interested in science.\nI think that art always has a kind of scientific\ndiscipline to it. For a great painter, the geome-try, the way colours work together, the sense of\narchitecture all work together. Those structural\nthings really make the kind of art I like. Because I don\u2019t really like people who just come\nout and it\u2019s pure self expression; just vomiting\ntheir emotions. Who cares what someone feels?\nWhat you really want is to see feelings through\nthe prism of some universal sense of pattern,\nsome way of things unfolding so it\u2019s, in some\nway outside the person.\nMT: So you would say that this kind of physics is something that inspired your work or is\nit something that you read about and then you\nwant to communicate it to other people?\nKA: I would say that the spirit of innovation\nis something I would like to use and communicate to other people. The physics itself is more\nof an existential meditation. Einstein though\nthe world was so predictable. It\u2019s very interesting that the people who came after him thought\nArmitage Here?\nit was chaotic and completely unpredictable.\nThe latest innovations in physics are saythat\nyou have to have both in. To me it\u2019s a way of\nquestioning what is reality? What is our experience in life? What is it that makes us tick?\nMT: Can you give an example how that has\ninspired your choreography?\nKA: I\u2019m very interested in fractals; the\ngeometry of clouds and mountains and sea-shores. Dance used to be all Euclidean. Vertical and horizontal lines only; all about stability.\nIt was the sovereign image of incredible pomp\nand prestige. That is ballet\u2019s roots. The new\ndemocratic idea is about using things like fractals to make all kinds of curves and final tene-ity. You have great individuality and yet there\nis a common purpose so it\u2019s still legible. I\u2019m\ninterested in the way that dance can become as\nfunky and democratic and multidimensional as\nour way of living and as our knowledge of the\nuniverse is now.\nMT: The troop you are working with at the\nmoment, are they people you have worked with\nbefore?\nKA: We are based in New York. We work\nmore than half the year together. I takes a great\ndeal of rehearsal to do this kind of extremely\nvirtuosic, high powered dance and also to allow\nthat much individuality and yet to keep it very\narticulate.\nMT: That idea of characterisations seems\nquite important. I really felt that you knew the\ndancers well enough that you could bring out\ntheir own character.\nKA: That absolutely right. I love that. But\nbehind that there is a very rigorous disciplined\nstructure. Once that is achieved then lots of personality and complete individual personality is\nallowed to emerge.

I think they\u2019re wrong.\nFirstly, I do not believe that the vast\nmajority of \u201cthe public\u201d (whoever\nthe hell that means) are as gullible as\nthey\u2019re made out to be.

In fact people often have\npositive reactions to emerging technologies even after viewing \u201cscary\u201d sci-fi. A\nstudy found that after reading the novel\nPrey, where a swarm of nanoparticles\nruns riot, people had a more positive\nview of nanotechnology compared to\nthose who had not read the novel. Rather than causing concern, I think that science fiction reflects a fear of technology\nthat many people innately hold.\nSecondly, to assume that science fiction \u201charms\u201d science forgets about its\nmany benefits; who as a kid was not\ninspired to get into science because of\nS\no I was told that my pseudonym was not particularly\ninventive, but that\u2019s simply what I am: a girl with\nopinions. Got a problem\nwith that!? Then go away and read\nsomething else. I\u2019m here to get nitty\nand gritty and talk about the things\nthat others are too afraid to even think\nabout. In such a male-dominated uni-versity, it is imperative for us girls to\nstick together and fight for our rights\nas equals. I\u2019m not saying that all men\nare sexist, but some of them don\u2019t even\nrealise they are. Like the other day this\nguy held a door open for me and I was\nlike, \u201cI can open doors, you know!\nWhat, you think my arms aren\u2019t strong\nenough?\u201d\nBoys at Imperial are like children in\na sandpit - everyone wants to play with\nthe digger, and I\u2019m the digger. Sure, I\nkeep my hair nice and wear clothes that\naccentuate my curves, but I\u2019m not an\nobject. I don\u2019t dress to impress, I dress\nto be the best. I pride myself on looking good, and although I don\u2019t consider\nmyself to be the most attractive girl at\nImperial, I think boys are magnetized\nby my confidence. Girls, if there is\none tip I can give you, it\u2019s be happy in\nyourself and your happiness will shine.\nI normally find that depressed girls just\ngive up on themselves and let their hair\ngo all frizzy and start wearing baggy\njeans.

I can take misogynistic comments on the chin because\nI\u2019m thick-skinned, but there are some\nmore vulnerable girls starting at Imperial who wouldn\u2019t know how to handle\na comment like that. Chat-up lines are\na form of sexual harassment and degra-dation. It\u2019s not funny and it\u2019s definitely\nnot clever.\nNot all the boys are pestilent rats.\nDoes Science Fiction stand in the way of progress?\n\u201c\nScience f\ncience\nreflects a\nreflects a\n\u201d\nhat many\nhat many\nely hold\nely hold\nthe space ships on Star Trek or the massive dinosaurs on Jurassic Park? I would\nhasten a guess that many of you would\nnot be in science today if it weren\u2019t for\nsuch films. Even professional scientists\nare inspired to push the boundaries of\ntheir subjects by sci-fi. The creator of\nthe mobile phone, Martin Cooper, credits Captain Kirk\u2019s smart gadget as the\ninspiration behind the whole idea of a\nportable phone.\nPositive portrayals of science in sci-fi\nare not in short supply. In fact, in a vast\nnumber of films such as Outbreak, Deep\nImpact and Independence Day, science\nis portrayed as the world\u2019s saviour.\nTo say that sci-fi in some way hinders\nprogress is certainly not true \u2013 its benefits surely outweigh its disadvantages.\nBesides\u2026 it doesn\u2019t really matter: science fiction is a part of life and nothing\u2019s going to change that. At the end\nof the day it\u2019s just a bit of fun \u2013 so don\u2019t\nget yourselves worried, as I\u2019m sure you\nwere\u2026\nSome of them are actually quite nice,\nand I would recommend you take\nyour time to find the right one.

However, one residing\nwithin these cities often forgets where\nthe vast magnitude of energy needed\nto run them will come from when our\ncurrent reserves of oil and gas drip\ntheir last drop.\nIn fact, many are energy sceptics \u2013\nsuccumbing to the wave of hysteria\ninduced by many media outlets. Sure,\ntwo hundred trillion cubic feet of gas\nhas been found off the coast of Lancashire. Sure, the North Sea remains\nan eternal, bottomless vat, but the fact\nthat numbers can be assigned to these\nsources means that we should not rely\non short-term stimuli, and invest our\ntime in searching for real, groundbreaking solutions.\nHence I am honoured to be starting my time at Imperial College as an\nengineer. There is no hysteria (minus\nthe abundance of Freshers partying),\nno vacuity, but instead an academic\nand cultural kaleidoscope. There is\na subtle, all-encompassing allegory\nto be derived from it all; by being in\nan environment where nothing is the\nsame as it was before we abandon convention and conformism, we discover\ntruth from a base starting point.\nIn the midst of this intellectual clar-ity, my loan never arrived, some of us\nhave been to multi-storey nightclubs,\nran all the way home from Piccadilly using our internal compasses, and\nsome have even drank J\u00e4germeister\nfrom the bottle.

UCL Provost Professor Malcolm\nGrant last week told The Telegraph that\n\u201caward inflation over the past three decades has led to student performance being essentially recognised by classification into only two main groups: first class\nand upper second class honours.\u201d He\ncalled the system \u201ccrude and undistinguished\u201d and said that the changes would\n\u201censure that our students\u2019 mode of study\nis internationally recognised\u201d.\nIn the US, GPAsystem students receive\nletter grades, each with associated numerical values. The final grade for their\ndegree is the average of the numerical\nvalues of the grades that they received\nover the course of their studies. It is\npetitiveness on the international arena,\nwhich is unfamiliar with the British\nsystem, Heath responded that he feared\nthis effect might be outweighed by an\nincrease in competitiveness between\nstudents on a course, resulting in a corresponding decrease in cooperation. The\nAugust survey indicated that students\nwere opposed to any system that ranks\ngraduates within their class for the same\nreason. The \u2018White Paper Response\u2019\nquotes a student as saying that they think\nthat \u201ca ranking would be a bad idea as\npeople would no longer work together,\nbut against each other.\u201d\nthe publication of either a percentage\nor a year-position, either along with, or\ninstead of a degree class\u201d, especially in\nMathematics where \u201cdue to the precision of the discipline, [one is] able to rely\nheavily on the accuracy of ... individual\nmarks\u201d. He conveyed his view that while\n\u201cvery few academics believe the current\nscheme of degree classification makes\nmuch sense ... many are reluctant to tinker with a system which works tolerably\nmately 67% when taking into account the\nunique classification of medics, a figure\nthat is average for the Russell Group.\nDr Kogelbaur has explained that 92%\nof Chemical Engineering\u2019s graduates\nreceiving a first or 2:1 is a result of improvements in the quality of student intake and teaching. This was supported\nby Heath and Parmar, who praised the\nquality of communication between students and staff in the department. Dr Luc\nVandeperre, Materials Senior Tutor, has\nattributed the five year-on-year increases\nin the proportion of firsts and 2:1s awarded by his Department (it went up from\n69% in 2010 to 72% in 2011) to hard\nwork by students and admissions tutors\nwho \u201chave been attracting increasingly\nbetter prepared students\u201d.\nDr Vandeperre is also sceptical about\n\u201chow a grade point average would be\nbetter at combating grade inflation\u201d. This\nis a sentiment shared by Professor Mestel\nwho says that \u201cthe key question is does\n75% this year correspond to 75% next\nyear?\u201d\nOpinion about Grade Point Average\nsystem is clearly divided. However, as\nProfessor Mestel reminds us, \u201csuch matters are usually decided at College level\u201d\nand there are no indications that the College is likely to abandon the honours\nsystem any time soon. It is also worth\nremembering Dr Kogelbaur\u2019s belief that\n\u201cby rushing things students would be disadvantaged\u201d.\ncommon that, in addition to this, a fixed\npercentage of highest scoring students receive honours such as summa cum laude.\nThe exact form of UCL\u2019s new degree\nclassification is as of yet unknown but\nthe UCL Council\u2019s \u2018White Paper 20112021\u2019, which \u201coutlines a vision and strategy for UCL for the coming 10 years\u201d,\nstates it \u201cwill be distinctive, and will be\ndeveloped in such a way as to enable the\nGPA score for each student to be generated automatically from existing percent-age-based assessment scores.\u201d\nThe idea of following in UCL\u2019s foot-steps, however, is not popular with the\nCollege\u2019s students, according to a recent survey. Imperial College Union\u2019s\n\u2018Response to the 2011 [Government]\nHigher Education White Paper\u2019, written\nby Union President Scott Heath, Deputy\nPresident (Education) Jason Parmar and\nRepresentation Coordinator Andrew\nKeenan, notes that a student survey conducted by the Union thisAugust indicates\nthat the current honours system is generally supported by students. The survey,\nhowever, also indicates that the system\n\u201cwas of decreasing popularity as cohorts\nprogressed, with final year, masters and\nPhD students being least supportive.\u201d A\nthird year UK student is quoted as saying that \u201call firsts were not created equal;\nan employer cannot know which first is a\ngood first and which is not.\u201d\nAsked whether a Grade Point Average\nsystem might improve graduates\u2019 com\u201cAn employer cannot\nknow which first is a\ngood first\u201d\ned that introducing a GPA system would\nremove the need to make difficult decisions about what degree to award students who are on the boundary between\ntwo honours - a \u201cprocess that is not [en-tirely] objective\u201d.\nHe dismissed fears about increased\ncompetitiveness by pointing out that Imperial degree programs are already very\ncompetitive and that the effect of this is\noffset by labs and projects that emphasise\nteamwork. He also rejected Jason Parmar\u2019s concerns that unless most of the\nUniversities in the UK adopted the new\nsystem at once those who abandoned\nhonours would be at a disadvantage as a\nresult of confused employers. Dr Kogelbaur said that he believed that Imperial\u2019s\n\u201cbrand\u201d was strong enough for people\nto appreciate its degrees regardless of\nthe system. He believes that the College\n\u201ccould go it alone\u201d as long as it published\ndata on how many graduates got what\npercentages. This would be to compensate for Imperial\u2019s courses often being\nmore difficult than other institutions\u2019,\nwhich often results in lower marks.\nProfessor Jonathan Mestel, Director\nof Undergraduate Studies in the Department of Mathematics, agrees with many\nof Dr Kogelbaur\u2019s points. He says that\n\u201cfor a scientific institution in particular,\nthe degree classification system, with its\ndeliberate reduction of experimental ac-curacy, is very strange.\u201d He expressed a\npersonal \u201csympathy with any drive for\nUniversity College London\u2019s new proposals have seen support from some academics at Imperial\nUniversity College London\nNews Editors: Sophia David\nAlex Nowbar\nnews.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nImperial academics, however, are more\nopen to changes in the system. Speaking in a personal capacity, the Chemical\nEngineering Senior Tutor, Dr. Andreas\nKogelbauer, agreed with UCL\u2019s Professor Grant, claiming that the current system is crude. He pointed to the massive\ndifference between a 2:1 degree where a\nstudent achieved 61% and one where the\nstudent achieved 69%. He also highlight-well, and which employers understand.\u201d\nAll parties, however, agree that grade\ninflation, one of UCL\u2019s main reasons for\nthe change, is not a problem at Imperial.\nScott Heath has said that he firmly believes that Imperial is greatly concerned\nwith its academic reputation and as a\nresult strives to ensure that the requirements for achieving a particular degree\nclass are the same each year. He also\npointed out that The Telegraph article\nabout the UCL change was not entirely\ncorrect regarding its statement that 80%\nof Imperial College degrees awarded last\nyear were firsts and 2:1s. Heath claims\ninstead that the actual figure is approxi\u201cVery few academics\nbelieve the current\nsystem makes much\nsense\u201d\n\u201cSuch matters are\nusually decided at\nCollege level\u201d\nMaciej Matuszewski\n\n"

If you have ever\nspent any time on Chatroulette, you might be familiar with the format - you\u2019re paired with a stranger to\ntalk to. The twist lies in how CompassionPit pairs\nyou with a partner, however. On loading the website\nyou get to choose whether you want to be a \u2018venter\u2019\nor a \u2018listener\u2019. If you have something on your mind\n- pick \u2018venter\u2019 and you\u2019ll be paired with a \u2018listener\u2019\nwho will listen, give you advice or simply distract\nyou from your troubles. Pick \u2018listener\u2019 and the roles\nreverse. It\u2019s an excellent way to get something off\nyour mind to a complete stranger, or pass an otherwise idle hour or two. As with anything on the internet however, there\u2019s an occasional troll, so make\nsure you\u2019re not easily offended.\nFed up of watching keyboard cat? You\u2019re in luck - Youtube this week announced that they have rolled out\ntheir film rental service to the UK. It\u2019s an interesting\nchoice, with LoveFilm so established over here, but\nthe newcomer is off to a good start with almost identical pricing. You\u2019ll pay between \u00a32.49 and \u00a33.49 to\nrent a film, with an obvious correlation between price\nand how long it\u2019s been out for. With that, you get 30\ndays in which to watch your movie. But once you\u2019ve\nstarted watching it, you only have 48 hours to fin-ish. Currently about 1000 titles are available to rent,\nbut - being Google - you can be sure that number\nwill grow. With many of those movies you also get\nextras such as interviews and documentaies. You\nalso get access to your loaned film from pretty much\nanywhere, as it will be available on any computer you\nlog on to YouTube with. The service will additionally\nbe working with many Android devices, giving the option of entertainment on the move.\nRent films from YouTube\nI\nhave to admit that when I first picked\nup Livescribe\u2019s Echo Smartpen I was\nmore than a little skeptical, for good\nreason. I\u2019ve seen electronic note-taking\naids from my first year at Imperial, and\nthere\u2019s good reason why the Union Shop does\nsuch good business at the start of term: it will\ntake a lot to beat the simplicity of pen and pa-per.\nThe Smartpen doesn\u2019t try to replace the physical writing process, but instead captures an image of the page as you write on it, which you\ncan then transfer to your desktop. Despite finding it a bit gimmicky at first, using the device\ndid a lot to convince me that there is a niche\nfor this sort of product; whether the average\nstudent fits this niche is another matter entirely.\nOnce I had written a few pages, I decided to\ntake a look at the notes on my laptop. This\nproved to be a slightly more complicated\nprocess than I would have liked. I first had to\ndownload an installation bundle from the Livescribe website (they don\u2019t offer a disk), but\neven after doing that I wasn\u2019t able to synchronise the files on my pen with the desktop - I\nhad to download a 200MB update for the pen\nand then install it on the device before I could\nview my writing. While only a one-time an-noyance, I can\u2019t see why Livescribe released\nthe device lacking its most basic functionality.\nThe pages, once loaded, are of surprisingly\nhigh quality, capturing the curves of natural\nwriting with no pixelation or clarity loss what-soever. Livescribe also claims that you can\nsearch your handwritten notes through their\nsoftware, but I only managed to hit one word\nin five tries on some fairly neat handwriting,\nso you\u2019re not very much better off than with\na paper notebook. Despite this, the realistic\nnature of the notes means they might be very\nuseful for those courses that need a fair few dia-grams, such as chemistry or physics. You can\nread them on Livescribe\u2019s own software, export them to PDF, or share them on a variety of\nsites from Facebook to Google Docs. The best\npart about all of this is that it really does \u2018just\nwork\u2019. There is no fiddling around with settings\nbefore you get started, and barring the minor\nannoyance of the desktop software installation,\nyou\u2019re ready to go the minute you open the box.\nnotebooks setting you back another 20 pounds,\nyou\u2019re looking at organising your notes at the\ncost of a new touchscreen Kindle. Livescribe\nare the only people who make the required\nnotebooks for their pens, which means that if\nyou want your pen to be anything more than a\npricey ballpoint, you\u2019re locked into their \u2018ecosystem\u2019.\nA smart choice for lectures\nConsole yourself about your lack of human interaction with a shiny new pen. Who needs friends when you have a pen that talks?\nFeroz Salam reviews Livescribe\u2019s new infrared superpen\nGetting Started\nThe Smartpen is a sleek but supersized version of your standard biro, looking something\nlike a space-age marker. It\u2019s ready to use as\nsoon as you pull it out of the box. Getting\nstarted really is as simple as opening the sample notebook provided in the box and starting\nto write. With a standard ballpoint tip, it\u2019s a\nfeeling most of us are used to, and apart from\nthe weight of all the electronics, it\u2019s no different to using any other pen, if you can get used\nto the extra heft of the electronics inside.\nAt the bottom of every page there\u2019s a \u2018record\u2019 button. Pressing it will use the pen\u2019s\ninbuilt microphone to record sound while\nyou write, a sort of stream-of-consciousness\ndictaphone that might be very useful in lec-tures. The microphone is surprisingly clear\nand doesn\u2019t suffer from the cheap tinniness\nthat is all too common on this type of device.\nRecordings, like the images of pages, can be\nuploaded to your computer, but you can also\ntap on the start of a piece of text to listen to\nwhat you were recording while you wrote it\n- a brilliant feature that worked suprisingly\nwell.\nOn your desktop\nLifetime Lock-in\nNiggles aside, the Smartpen would be a truly\noutstanding product if it wasn\u2019t for the sheer\ncost of using it on a regular basis. Amazon is\noffering the cheapest version of the pen for\n100 pounds a pop, and you\u2019ll be needing regular purchases of their dot-paper notebooks to\nmake it worth your while. With four 100-page\nLivescribe\u2019s digital pen mostly delivers what it promises - neat images of your\nnotes with little hassle. The microphone is a\nstrong addition as well and gives the feeling\nof being a well planned feature rather than a\nhasty afterthought. In terms of digital note\ntaking solutions, this is one of the nicer ones\nI have seen, combining the familiar feeling\nof writing on paper with an electronic interface that\u2019s a lot more than flashy lights and\nnoises.\nYet I have mixed feelings about how relevant such a device would be to students.\nMost people I know make do with a refill\npad and a cheap pen for everyday note tak-ing, and I doubt my spending on stationery\nhas hit more than 100 pounds over my four\nyears at Imperial.\nDespite this, whether you find the Smartpen worth your money will depend on the\ntype of student you are. If you\u2019ve ever found\nyourself arguing that \u2018I know where everything is, it\u2019s my mess!\u2019, you probably won\u2019t\nwant the Smartpen.\nThose who like their notes meticulous and\ntidy, however, might find value in a device\nthat can pull together an entire lecture, from\nthe lecturer\u2019s voice to diagrams on paper,\ninto one easily browsable interface. With\nsolid build quality and an easy interface, I\ncan see this device lasting a long time without needing repairs. The Smartpen is well\nworth the purchase if you can justify the\nprice.\nIn Review\n\n"

    "content": "MUSIC\nFELIX\n28 Friday 14 October 2011\nmusic.felix@gmail.com\nKadhim\u2019s totally hot\nalbum of the week\nGirls\nFather, Son, Holy\nGhost\n2011\nGirls\u2019 frontman Christopher Owen is an opiate-addict-ed former cult-member: have I got your attention?\nGood. Father, Son, Holy Ghost is the richest indie-rock\nalbum that anyone has made in a long time. It\u2019s as\nrich as a warm chocolate brownie with artery-clogging\nchocolate sauce on top and a dollop of triple cream\non top of that for good coronary measure.\nTheir first album was enjoyable enough; it pushed a\nsomewhat immature sense of angst about girls, being crazy, and wishing you had a \u201cpizza and a bottle\nof wine\u201d. It tugged at the heartstrings with the intellectual rigour of a stupid, slobbering puppy.\nTheir second album, on the other hand, touches\nparts of me that have never been touched before (cue\n\u2018hilarious\u2019 joke about Imperial virgins). But seriously,\nthis album croons, shakes it hair out, beams a smile\nacross the room at you, cuts its arms, headbangs\nlike a crazy muthafucker, and bares a soul so sad, so\nlonely, so yearning for redemption that you can barely\nkeep listening. But, crucially, it rewards repeat lis-tens. These are emotions to be understood with care,\nnot simply gawped at for disposable amusement.\nI\u2019ll end with a slightly trivial point. Around half-way\nthrough the album, near the end of the song \u2018Vomit\u2019,\nyou\u2019re suddenly surprised by gospel singers belting\nout harmonies; I haven\u2019t had the words \u201cso fucking\ngood\u201d explode out of my head so powerfully than at\nthat moment.\nTell me the last song that made you think \u201cso fucking\ngood\u201d by tweeting me @kadhimshubber. If, by some\ncoincidence, it happens to be \u2018Vomit\u2019, tell Christopher\nOwens direct by tweeting him @Chri55yBaby.\nMusic Editors: I\u00f1igo Martinez de Rituerto\nStephen Smith\nW\nhen I got elected as station manager of IC Radio\nfor the coming year, many\npeople were surprised\u2026\nincluding myself! I stood\na clueless (albeit enthusiastic) fresher whose\nfirst suggestion to get the station on FM airwaves was very swiftly shot down (An on-air\nradio license in the middle of London? Good\none, fresher!). Honestly, I don\u2019t know how I\ngot elected \u2013 I remember saying the phrase\n\u201cI\u2019m charming, so vote for me\u201d. Must be the\nIrish accent that made that statement seem endearing rather than obscenely obnoxious. Anyway, I can tell you now, that despite being barraged with hundreds of emails, being station\nmanager of a student radio station really is as\nawesome as it sounds.\nBut enough about me. What does the radio society actually do? Who are we? What\non earth are these programmes broadcasted\nso shamelessly for the entire world to hear?\nWhy do you care? Why are you reading this?\nShouldn\u2019t you be studying? Where am I?\nIC Radio is the official sound of Imperial\nCollege London. We\u2019re an internet-broadcast-ed station playing 24 hours a day, 7 days a\nweek, alternating between live broadcasts and\na play-out of our enormous library. Our music\nteam is working hard on reviewing new music\nthat we\u2019re sent every day from labels, independent artists and flat out gangstas to ensure\nthat our play-out system only contains quality\ntunes. Our presenters are students just like you\n\u2013 hard working (ish) nerds who sincerely love\na laugh.\nRadio is fun. Even for people who get a little\nbit nervous speaking in front of people, you can\nstill tell yourself that you\u2019re really only speaking to the wall when you\u2019re in the studio. Listen\nto any decent station and the presenters are generally having a good laugh (unless they\u2019re reading the news, in which case that\u2019s incredibly unprofessional and I highly disapprove). Societies\nare meant to be fun and rewarding \u2013 otherwise\nwhat\u2019s the point?\nHere at IC Radio, we will give you a show\nwhich you can make your own. We only ask\nthat you undergo a 20 minute training session\non how to use the equipment and obey the\nusual don\u2019t-be-racist, etc. From then on, you\u2019re\nbasically given free rein to do whatever genre\nof programming you like \u2013 talk, pop, rock,\nelectronica, psychedelic funk, Australian folk,\nwhatever. Once you have joined the society\nthe door is pretty much open for you to use our\ngear. If there isn\u2019t a show on you can come in\nand practice on the decks in the studio - much\nIC Radio wants you!\nAislinn Hayes tunes in as new Station Manager\n1xtra. [Insert further cheers here.] For anyone\nwho\u2019s even vaguely thinking about a career in\nthe music or media industry, we have some really incredible opportunities coming our way all\nthe time where you can gain invaluable experi-ence.\nHonestly, I can\u2019t imagine the week without my one-hour slot (entitled \u201cMad Craic\u201d)\nin our modest Beit West Wing Basement stu-dio. I wouldn\u2019t be at Imperial if I wasn\u2019t at\nleast vaguely technical and all the buttons and\nslides down there make me positively gleeful.\nMusic, technology, and the sound of my own\nvo\u2013 I mean, banter with my co-host, notorious\nbiologist Craig Woods. What else does a girl\nneed? It\u2019s an absolutely brilliant society to get\ninvolved in - whether it\u2019s music, production,\npresenting, technical, DJing, or even marketing\nthat you\u2019re into, we\u2019ve got an enthusiastic committee member who can help you out!\nCheck us out on www.icradio.com, where\nyou can listen live or listen back to previous shows, and hear some of our best sessions and recordings!\nTo get involved in our music team, contact music@icradio.com\nTo get involved in our live sessions and\nrecordings, contact production@icradio.\ncom\nTo hire equipment or get some DJing gigs,\ncontact discos@icradio.com\nTo get your own show, contact program-ming@icradio.com\nTo complain about the length of this\narticle, contact manager@icradio.com.\nCheers!\ncheaper and convenient than buying your own\nstuff and carting it to uni every time you want\nto jam. And all for a very reasonable 8 pound\nmembership fee? Simply fabulous, dahling.\n24 hour music and programming isn\u2019t all we\ndo. We are blessed with a fully equipped recording studio as well as our production studio,\nmeaning we get plenty of bands and artists in to\ndo live sessions and recordings. We are pretty\nunique to have such a facility as a student radio\nand we\u2019re planning on holding lots of live sessions this year. They are open for anyone to turn\nup to and watch, and are held in our \u201cshared studio\u201d (completely separate to our production and\nrecording studios, and shared with Music Tech,\nPhotosoc and Stoic). Some names we have lined\nup for this year include Tay Mos, Sam Gray, The\nKing Blues, and Missing Andy. I was told by\nthe previous station manager that our recording\nstudio is unrivaled by other student radio stations here in the UK \u2013 in fact, he compared our\nstudios to the professionals at XFm. Not to be\ntooting our own horn or anything, but I think\nthat\u2019s pretty impressive \u2013 even if the man I\u2019m\nquoting basically founded IC Radio Recordings\nhimself and is therefore fairly biased.\nWe also make a point of hiring out our equipment to parties and events to make some extra\ncash so we can buy new toys (and pay our license fees, etc.) and there are always opportunities for budding DJs to play some gigs, which\nour members do take advantage of whenever\nthey can.\nAs a London-based station, we have the ad-vantage/disadvantage of getting lots of emails\nfrom those in the media industry and upcoming\nartists. True, we get a lot of spam, but sometimes\na golden ticket flies our way. Just last month we\nwere contacted by the presenting company for\nthe Olympics with an opportunity for budding\npresenters to audition for 2012 events. [Insert\nscream here.] And just last week, a representative from the Student Radio Association contacted us about some radio work with BBC\nTonight in Dalston\nSomewhere between talking to a rolling meadow and\nhugging a star, Mark McGuire\u2019s solo adventures all\nbut mirror the chromophilic swells of electronic trio\nEmeralds.

On a\nday where the weather conditions were\nunusually favorable, Imperial made it\ndifficult to overcome their stubborn op-position.\nDespite the close full time score,\nImperial started the much stronger of\nthe two sides. It appeared as though\nthe three weeks of intense pre season\nwhich Imperial had undergone was\ngoing to pay off.\nFor the first twenty minutes Imperial played their pattern to perfection,\nusing forwards through the midfield\nto great effect whist the backs looked\ncomfortable with ball in hand. Imperial\u2019s dominance was so telling that\nPortsmouth struggled to leave their 22\nfor the first ten minutes of the match.\nSuch intense pressure was sure to\nresult in a score sooner, rather than\nlater and the first points were scored\nby Sean Baker. Good ball at the lin-eout just inside the Portsmouth 22\nmeter line was driven on by the forwards with Baker controlling well at\nthe back and slumping over once the\nnecessary yards were made.\nImperial should have pushed on\nfrom such a positive position, but it\nwas not to be. Switching off at the restart allowed Portsmouth to turn the\nball over and spread it out wide to\ntouch down in the corner and level the\nscores.\nEncouragingly though, Imperial hit\nback and after good play within Portsmouth\u2019s half, soft hands from Chris\nMcGeough and James Cox allowed\nFlannan Mahony to go over in the\nright corner.\nWorryingly for Imperial, Mike\nFloyd suffered a stinger on his shoulder towards the end of the first half\nwhich lead to a reshuffle in the backs;\nOlly Cox took up position at 10, a position in which again, he did not look\nentirely comfortable; kicking the ball\nout on the full on more than one oc-casion. Imperial went into the break\nwith a comfortable 17-5 lead thanks to\na third try of the match from George\nLane.\nImperial really should have capitalised on their lead and used their fitness\nto overcome their opponents in the\nsecond half yet they got caught up in\na messy struggle. Floyd had recovered\nfrom his previous knock and returned\nto the fray allowing Cox to move back\nto his usual position of scrum half\nwhere he looked more assured. Despite the balance of the team appearing to be restored, Imperial made hard\nwork of overcoming their opposition.\nPortsmouth ran in two tries, both\nof which can be attributed to poor\ndefence; firstly missed tackles in the\nmidfield and secondly a mismatch in\nnumbers out wide. It became apparent\nthat Imperial were involved in a real\ncontest and whilst being in control of\nthe match, Portsmouth were only two\npoints behind.\nImperial\u2019s fourth try came courtesy\nof captain Charlie Esberger, making\nup for squandering a scoring opportunity from a metre out previously in\nthe match.\nPortsmouth were not about to give\nup without a fight however, and scored\ntheir fourth try of the match in the final play. Their kicker was not able\nto convert the extras however, which\nwould have drawn the match.\nDespite appearing to have suffered\na let off for their inconsistent play,\nImperial were able to come away with\nan important win in their opening fixture of the year. There were positives\nto take from the match and build upon\nas the season progresses during a year\nwhen the team looks to be promoted.\nIC Rugby Union are sponsored by:\n\n"

This project certainly proved to be hard-hitting and many of the KOP volunteers (myself\nincluded) were taken aback by the level of poverty which these young boys were facing. It was\nclear that the work going on at HOVIC was both\neffective and critical, giving teenage boys a roof\nover their heads, but more importantly trying to\nget them back to their families and back to school.\nThe boys also received lessons in maths, English,\nSwahili and life-skills during their time spent at\nHOVIC, making the transition to school significantly easier.\nHaving chatted to the guys at HOVIC (whose\nages range from 8-16) we were able to hear about\nthe reasons which led them to live on the streets,\nand also their plans for when they left HOVIC.\nThe experience of HOVIC was inspiring, but also\nsomewhat saddening; the genuine enthusiasm\nand kindness of these boys made it easy to forget the fact that many of them came from backgrounds of drug addiction, glue sniffing (which\nis very common in Kisumu) and domestic abuse\nand that many of them were suffering from diseases such as malaria and even HIV. As clich\u00e9d\nas it may sound, HOVIC has remained a key reminder of why KOP exists, to tackle the issues\nof education, nutrition and healthcare for some of\nKenya\u2019s poorest children.

The group\u2019s size quickly became evident, much\nto the dismay of the ticket collectors - who promptly\nopened the gates and waved us through without much\nquestion.\nWe settled on the train and prepared ourselves for\nthe journey ahead with (hopefully) everyone informed\nof which station we would need to change at. Typical\ntrain journey conversations began with quick introductions and the standard \u201cName/Course/Halls\u201d ques-tions, followed shortly by a comparison of hangovers\namongst some of the committee members.

We should have known bet-ter, and suffered the consequences of soggy feet for\nthe rest of the day.\nWe then made a start on the walk itself which largely uneventful before lunch. The educated amongst you\nwill know that preparing pasta in advance of a trip is\nalways better than squished sandwiches and is best\nserved with beer and preferably on a cliff looking out\nto the sea and blue-ish skies. Some of us had all 3.\nAfter lunch, we continued our walk across the sis-ters, and most of us stopped at the pub conveniently\nlocated in the middle, where we able to witness a\nfrantic phone conversation between a table in the pub\nand the top of the next hill (ooops).\nFinally, about an hour ahead of usual schedule we\narrived in Eastbourne and regrouped again to organise fish & chips. We were led to the \u201cbest fish & chips\nin Eastbourne\u201d by Nathaniel. It was also the only one\nopen - coincidence? It took rather a long time for everybody to be served, but we were soon all munching\non our well earned dinners.\nUnlike many previous years, trains were actually running from Eastbourne and this Sunday walk was devoid of dreaded bus replacement services. The journey home was much quieter, and while many took the\nchance for a quick nap, there were some evaluations\nmade of the trip too. The general consensus amongst\nthe new members was that the trip was a \u201csuccess\u201d\nand \u201cgood\u201d, however one not-so-satisfied newbie did\nstate \u201cBeachy Head wasn\u2019t all it was cracked up to\nbe\u201d.\nIf you want to join us on a trip, either just for the\nday or for one of our weekend trips then come and\nmeet us in Beit Quad where we meet every Tuesday at\nlunchtime. Always feel free to email fellwa@imperial.\nac.uk to find out more! Simon Evans\nNathaniel Bottrell\nby the guys and I would no sooner have finished\none conversation when I would find myself being\nforced into another game of checkers\u2026or having\nmy shoes stolen! After three days it was time to\nleave for the final project, Oasis of Hope.\nThis project is one which KOP has been involved in right from the beginning and it is amazing to see how the school has been transformed.\nOne of the issues at the school is the fact that they\nare unable to provide free meals for the students\n(most of the pupils are unable to afford 20p for\nlunch) and this is something which KOP is planning to address in the future.\nI don\u2019t want to say that this was a once in a\nlifetime experience because I have every intention of returning to Kenya with KOP again next\nsummer. Instead I would say the experience\nwas life altering. People have since asked me so\nmany questions about my trip: \u201cDid you go out\nand save the world?\u201d Well, no, but that was never\nour intention. There were no empty promises of\nbuilding a town, or curing world hunger in a fort-night. These things take time, I was just glad to\nhave the opportunity to be involved in the slow\nprocess of improving the quality of life for the\npeople of Kisumu. With KOP I managed to make\na real contribution to the development of many\nchildren\u2019s and at the same time I got to meet new\npeople who have now become close friends, both\nin Kenya and from the other university students.\nSo whether you feel like you want to experience\na new culture, just do something different with\nyour summer, or if you\u2019re still sceptical about this\nsort of charity I would say one thing - just try it\nand see. It\u2019s a chance to make a difference to the\nlives of people who really need it the most. All\nin all, I really couldn\u2019t have asked for much more\nfrom a two week trip. But why would you take\nmy word for it? The only way to really get what\nI\u2019m talking about is to experience it for yourself...\nand you can always thank me later!\nKOP will be holding a Meet and Greet in room\n119 in SAF (up the main stairs) on Thursday 20th\nOct at 7pm. There will be a chance to meet the\ncommittee and other KOP members, find out\nwhat\u2019s planned for the year ahead and ask any\nquestions. There will also be free pizza and wine!\nA more formal presentation on the Student Summer Programme will follow in the coming weeks.\nEmail cag-kop@imperial.ac.uk for more info.\nH\nave you ever had the chance\nto stand in front of a class of 40\nwide-eyed Kenyan children and\nattempted to teach them about ma-trices? Have you ever rocked out\nwith a group of Luo tribeswoman, or been mauled\nby a velvet monkey? If you had told me a year\nago by now I would have experienced all these\nevents I would honestly have called you insane.\nYet last July, I somehow found myself on a plane\nto Nairobi with 10 other students, ready to take\npart in the Kenyan Orphan Project (KOP) summer programme.\nI first heard about KOP at the Fresher\u2019s Fair last\nOctober and to be honest I was slightly sceptical\nto begin with. Remnants of conversations with\nfriends about their time spent on a \u201cspiritual, cul-tural, political exchange thing\u201d during their GapYah had made me question the effectiveness of\nprojects like this one but I thought \u201cWhy not?\u201d\nand so signed up to attend the first meeting. If I\nliked what I heard, then great and if not, well, at\nleast there were free Hummingbird Cakes.\nThroughout the following year I found myself in the middle of a mad fundraising effort to\nachieve our group target of over \u00a38000. After a\nyear we eventually gathered together the required\namount and so the KOP summer team were ready\nto pack their bags (full of Kit-Kats and Pringles in\nsome cases) and head out to Kisumu, eager to find\nout what lay in store. By the time we had touched\ndown in Nairobi, I think it\u2019s fair to say we were all\nexhausted from travelling. Luckily for us it was\nonly an 8 hour journey to Kisumu\u2026 by coach\u2026\nUpon arrival at the Duke of Breeze hotel in\nKisumu we were introduced to the project lead-ers: Marti, with a love of jokes about cheese; and\nShona, who had managed to find the only shop\nin Kisumu which sold Irn-Bru. After a warm introduction and a brief on each of the projects it\nwas time for a nice cold Tusker (or three) on the\namazing rooftop bar.\nAn early start followed by a cold shower set us\nup for our first day at Ombeyi Feeding Centre, a\njoint project between KOP and local NGO \u2013 the\nOgra Foundation. We arrived at the project and\nwere immediately introduced to the lively manager Ada who quickly filled us in on the day\u2019s\nactivities. Our time at Ombeyi was mainly spent\ncarrying out daily chores - such as watering the\n\u201cI have every intention of\nreturning to Kenya\u201d\n\n"

I really loved the fish fingers\nwith the sweet sauce.\nM: Well, Dishoom is a traditional Indian restaurant but at the same time\nits menu offers a broad choice of both\nspicy, non-spicy and also vegetarian\ndishes.\nA: Yes, this is absolutely true. I am\nwondering why you chose that spicy\ncocktail drink. I mean, we tried many\nspicy dishes like the house black daal\n- you should have got a sweet cocktail\nlike the Bombay Colada.\nM: A spicy cocktail like Chilli Martini may sound weird but it matches\nperfectly with most of the dishes and\nsurely completes their taste. What did\nyou think of the \u201cFish Ruby\u201d? I have to\nadmit I\u2019m used to curry combined with\nchicken but that was a blast!\nA: That\u2019s why it was the speciality of\nthe day, it was special indeed! One of\nthe best dishes that should be included\nin the menu. You know what? You may\nfind it silly, but what I enjoyed the most\nwas Raita. Mouthwatering and refresh-ing! Together with the garlic bread it\nwas the best side dish.\nM: I totally understand. Even if you\nare not into spicy foods, just combining them with a yoghurt dip - like Raita\n- can just make you think about the flavours spices trigger. I particularly like\nthe fact that you have so many choices.\nNo need to limit your selection to 1\ndish; Just order three, four maybe five\nplates and share them among the table!\nA: Yes indeed, it gives you the opportunity to enjoy many different dishes.\nHave you noticed that we have finished\nour three course meal in just one hour?\nAnastasia Eleftheriou\nMichael Krestas\nA: I literally can\u2019t move at the moment.\nI\u2019m full. You should have stopped me\nafter the fifth dish!\nM: What could I have done? Everything was great! However, there\u2019s always space for some extra Dishoom\ncalamari.\nA: Oh yeah, all the dishes were fantas-tic. Although I am not a big fan of InM: That was very impressive, the service is splendid. Dishes are properly\ncooked and presented, the waiters and\nwaitresses look very keen to assist you\nand that really contributes to the overall experience.\nA: I totally agree. Dishoom has a very\nwarm atmosphere and it was packed,\neven though it was a Wednesday. Fortunately, we made a reservation.\nM: That\u2019s just more proof of how popular Dishoom is.\nA: Oh come on! Tell me about the\ndesserts! Personally I couldn\u2019t resist\ntaking my usual; chocolate fondant,\nyummy!\nM: Ok, I\u2019m gonna admit it: I did try\nsome of your fondant while you were\naway from the table! There, I said it!\nBut you stole some of my delicious\npineapple & black pepper crumble ...\nand not just once!\nA: I just wanted to try the combination of pineapple, honey, oats and ice-cream...\nM: I forgot to ask you, why did I have\nto carry my camera with me?\nA: Oh lord... we were supposed to take\nsome photos! But as soon as the food\narrived, I couldn\u2019t think of anything\nbut eating!\nM: So, when are we visiting Dishoom\nagain?\nA: Are you free next week?\nM: Sure!\nA: So you\u2019d recommend it huh?\nM: Totally!\nwww.dishoom.com\n12 Upper St. Martin\u2019s Lane,\nLondon WC2H 9FB\nTel: 020 7420 9320\nLast issue, Felix Food made mention\nof the Chocolate Week, the London\nRestaurant Festival and the Diwali\nFestival. It\u2019s likely some of you dislike chocolate, hate restaurant festivals or think Indian food is just another thing that drags you to the toilet!\nSo, let\u2019s talk about cheese\u2026 and wine!\nThe Cheese & Wine Festival is\ntaking place on 14 \u2013 16 Oct at the\nSouthbank Centre Square in London.\nA wide range of stalls will be showcasing the highest quality cheeses\nand wines from the UK and around\nthe world. As with any self-respect-ing festival, it will also offer many\nexciting activities. There are going\nto be many cooking demonstrations\nby celebrity chefs such as Valentina\nHarris and Tim Atkin! However, if\nyou think that watching someone\ncook is boring, you may join me in\nan Australian wine tasting session\nwith Brian Oakwell - or a cheese\nand beer pairing of La Cave \u00e0 Fromage & Meantime Brewery, who said\njust brilliantly: \u201cWhat two foods are\nmade for each other more than beer\nand cheese\u2026 Cheese is beer back-wards, or beer is cheese backwards.\u201d\nFinally and most importantly, all\nof us are either students or (very)\nhard-working employees and are\naware that fine cheese and wine can\nbe a bit\u2026expensive. Admission to the\nCheese & Wine festival is FREE*. It\u2019s\nas if it was organized especially for\nus! So remember: do not have lunch\nat Queen\u2019s Tower or the Library Caf\u00e9.\nBrace yourself for a cheesy evening\nand quench your thirst with plenty of\nwine!

    "content": "FELIX Friday 14 october 2011 29\nMUSIC\nA\nccounts of the first instalment\nof Outlook Festival four years\nback (held in a Croatian night\nclub with relatively low attendance and a lot of rain) sound\nlike Phoenix Nights on the Adriatic. Since then\nthe event has come a long way.\nThis year saw close to 12,000 festival-goers;\nsome of the biggest names in bass-heavy music\nperforming and an arena re-vamped so fittingly\none can\u2019t help but imagine that when they built\nFort Punta Christo however many centuries ago\nthey must have had the festival in mind. Couple\nthat with the mellowed beauty of the location\n(at least on day one), some darn fine weather\nand a young energetic crowd and you get a feeling for why Outlook is in a league of its own.\nThe festival is split between the campsite\nand the main arena. The campsite is located\naround a bay on the Adriatic and contains a super market and a number of bars and pop-up\nrestaurants. Daytime sees mass migration to the\nvarious beaches where the two or three sound\nsystems play out until the evening.\nThe arena is split between the main stage-a\nlarge open space by the waterfront-and the fort\nwhich itself contains a number of smaller stag-es, all equally impressive.\nDespite Barrington Levy\u2019s last minute with-drawal, the quality of performances was never\ngoing to be an issue. David Rodigan opened\nthe main stage with his trademark feel-good\nOutlook Festival returns\nDaniel Oppenheimer reports from sunny Croatia\nIt\u2019s very difficult to fault Outlook - in fact, it\nrequires resorting to geriatric-style complaints\nregarding things like organisation (there was a\nlot of queuing where it felt like there shouldn\u2019t\nhave been). Having said that, there was a clear\nsense of nostalgia from many of last year\u2019s returnees who felt the festival had grown excessively and in doing so lost its former intimacy\nand relaxedness. Organisers should be mindful\nof not spawning another Reading or Leeds in\nPula. For the moment, suffice it to say this:\nCarlsberg don\u2019t make festivals but if they did\nthey\u2019d probably be something like Outlook.\nhistory lesson. The reggae-dub theme was followed up by The Gentleman\u2019s Dub Club, Iration Steppahs and, elsewhere in the fort, The\nHeatwave.\nGrime was well represented by Newham\nGenerals, Logan Sama and a mammoth set\nfrom P Money that seemed to straddle at least\n4 or 5 DJ sets. The second and third nights\nwere dominated by El-B, Rustie, Hudson Mohawke and the Hessle Audio bunch while the\nfinal night saw Marcus Nasty tearing it up followed by Night Slugs DJs, Mosca, Bok Bok,\nL-Vis 1990 and Girl Unit.\nDude, where\u2019s the beach?\nRototom Sunsplash is one of the largest and\nlongest running Reggae, Dance Hall and Dub\nfestivals in Europe. In fitting with the music it\nendorses, its appeal spans a cross-section of festival goers from the ignorant non-connoisseur to\nthe dub-geek-stoner. The recipe is very simple:\nan entirely laid back dynamic, a hot climate and\nenough people to make you feel it was worth\ncoming but leave you with space to move.\nThe festival is set outside the Spanish town\nof Benic\u00e0ssim on the same site as the Festival\nInternacional de Benic\u00e0ssim. With music beginning in the early evening the daytime sees\na mass migration from the shanty-townesque\ncampsite to the beach. However, for those who\nstick around the arena offers a mellowed atmo-sphere, hammocks and shade as well as lectures\nand presentations on topics ranging from The\nLife of Bob Marley to Man Vibes: Masculinities\nin the Dancehall.\nSpanning ten days the festival manages to\ncram in a large number of musicians. The main\nacts finish at around 1 am but DJs continue playing on the Dance Hall Stage and Dub Station\nuntil much later. This year some of the best per-part conspicuously absent creating, at times, a\ndistinct sense that some heavy cultural tourism\nwas being indulged. This was underpinned by\nan ostentatious, pseudo-pagan inclusion of Bob\nMarley\u2019s memory in nearly all aspects of the\nfestival. For the relentless neurotic this might be\na turn off, but if you want sun, don\u2019t mind slowing down the pace for a week or so and like reggae music, even just a little bit, then Rototom\nSunsplash comes highly recommended.\nformances came from the charged and energetic\nCapleton; the evocative Marley clan (Stephen,\nZiggy, Ky-Mani and Rita Marley) and the charismatic Luciano, who was kind enough to lend\nme a lift from the airport to the festival site. Both\nJimmy Cliff and Toots and the Maytals were\nalso reportedly very good.\nThe character of the festival draws more from\nhippy themes than Jamaican ones, indeed this\nyear actual Jamaican people were for the most\nSicily: land of citrus fruit, olive oil, Cosa Nostra, and\nUzeda, a band hailing from the foothills of smoking\nMt. Etna. Three of their five albums were recorded by\nSteve Albini, the pixie of punk rock himself, and released on the Touch & Go label. Albini\u2019s instantly recognizable sound on 4 (1995), Different Section Wires\n(1998), and Stella (2006) encouraged online music\nmagazine Pitchfork to call Uzeda \u201ca T&G cover band\nwith Kim Deal on vocals\u201d. But that\u2019s no bad thing.\nThey share a soundscape with Touch & Go labelmates\nShellac (Albini\u2019s own band) and the David Yow-fronted\nJesus Lizard. \u201cTighter than a supermodel\u2019s stomach\u201d\nis one way I\u2019ve heard the Jesus Lizard described and\nthat\u2019ll do just as nicely for Uzeda. And never mind the\nPixies\u2019 Kim Deal; Uzeda\u2019s vocalist Giovanna Cacciola\nis a female Yow, cooing and moaning and pleading\nin a monologue that tugs at the engine of the band.\nAnd what an engine: \u201ca tribal-jazzy rhythm section\nthat indulges in time changes worthy of prog-rock but\ncoupled with shrieking guitar that makes Sonic Youth\nsound mainstream\u201d, says Piero Scaruffi in his online\nHistory of Rock Music. There\u2019s a wildness here, the\nbass growling like a feral dog, the guitars spiking like\nthe tongue of a snake, unpredictable and languid. But\nthe tightness makes it more machine than animal: a\nwell-tuned engine bolted together by the piston snap\nof the snare.\nCheck out www.uzedatheband.com for audio and video streams of all the band\u2019s recorded material.\nPunk planet by\nDouglas Heaven\nThis week: Uzeda\nBeautiful Benic\u00e0ssim\nSpanish Rototom Sunsplash impresses over ten days\n\u201cTerribly sorry, I can\u2019t quite hear you!\u201d\nMake sure not to miss\nElectric wizard and founder of avant-garde music\ndistributor Mimaroglu Music Sales, KFW crosses the\nocean for a rare appearance in London next week.\nBending ear drums as he ignites the air, sending unprecedented patterns across the room and exposing\nthe infinite space held inside a momentary burst of\nsound, KFW has become one of the most striking figures in modern electronic music.

Embrace the cold and define your style\nwith Alice Yang\u2019s pick of the best\nFur\nWhat better way to combat the winter chills than to\nwrap up warm in a fluffy fur coat? From Paris to Milan, fur was seen in a rainbow of colours, lengths\nand cuts leaving us spoilt for choice. Sleek glamour\nshone through with a seventies vibe at Gucci in the\nform of rich, gem coloured, bulging furs matched\nwith statement sunglasses. Cute baby doll dresses\nlayered under pale fox furs made Anna Sui\u2019s show a\nwinter wonderland.\nWhether you prefer the long shaggy furs seen at\nIsabel Marant, or the sleeker more classic pieces at\nValentino, fur is this seasons must have with the one\nbig rule \u2013 if your coat is going to bulge ontop, ensure\nfluid lines flow beneath.\nTHE PICK:\nKarl Lagerfeld brought a plethora of thick woollen\npieces wrapped in rusty shades perfect for frosty\nwalks to his show at Fendi this seaon. But among\nthose, it was the fluffy coats that stole the show.\nThey appeared as lustrous tufts of auburn orange,\nchocolate brown and silver greys all mixed into one.\nFor a similar, but more toned down take, try Miss\nSelfridge\u2019s silky tribute to the coming shades of na-ture.\nFull Length\nBlazer Cape\nThere was a great sense of drama and mystery this\nseason as designers sent floor sweeping coats\ndown the catwalks. The great coat was seen at\nHermes, Jaeger London and Rodarte \u2013 all simple\nand perfectly tailored, with just the right amount\nof flow. Chanel\u2019s burnt forest catwalk too featured\nankle length knitted numbers with thick defined col-lars, and DSqaured2\u2019s Western rebel girls matched\ntough billowing cloaks to their aggressively shaped\nhats and distressed denim.\nGiorgio Armani\u2019s overcoats were only zipped down\nto the waist, allowing the smooth silk dresses that\nshimmered beneath to peak through contrasting the\ntexturised detailing on the coats. Haider Ackermann\nupped the drama \u2013 black leather gloves and powerfully layered jackets building sharp silhouettes\ntopped off with sky high quiffs.\nLong, sleek and filled with authority, this is definitely a statement making addition to your wardrobe.\nTHE PICK:\nIn shades of slate grey with fur trimmed lapels and\nrough edges, Pheobe Philo\u2019s overcoats at Celine\nwere modern authenticity at its best. Topshop\u2019s alternative also features a thick fluffy neckline, adding extra warmth to its moulded classic shape and\ntucked in waist.\nFitting in perfectly with this season\u2019s trend of androgyny came a sea of sharp cut suit jackets worn\nwith a sense of purpose and power. Dolce and Gabbana pioneered the strong girl-boy look this season,\nstriking a perfect mix between masculine toughness\nand feminine delicacy. Perfect white shirts fastened\nto the neck sat under double-breasted jackets with\nwide collars and velvet lapels, topped with boyish\nquiffs under smart trilbies. Stella McCartney\u2019s jackets gave a new definition to power dressing - midnight black knee length blazers with rounded shoulders adding a feminine touch. Acne\u2019s jackets were\ntraditionally sleek - military greens and candyfloss\npinks adding a twist to the classic two-piece suit.\nIt\u2019s as much about the jacket this season as how\nit\u2019s worn. The models at Jason Wu, Michael Kors and\nPaul Smith all casually tossed over their shoulders.\nResult? Simple and sexy. The trick? Steal your boyfriend\u2019s blazer, sling over your shoulders, slip on a\npair of heels and stride with confidence.\nTHE PICK:\nJason Wu\u2019s blazers were immaculately tailored this\nseason. His contrasting lapels and defined shoulders were copied at Mango, for only a sliver of the\nprice.\nCapes and ponchos have been a long time coming,\nbut no one expected the masterpieces Alexander\nWang created this season. Luxuriously soft cash-meres mixed with tough leathers, draped shimmering silks and quilted interiors left editors piling over\nthemselves after his show for pieces that so cleverly combined feminine casual wear with tough out-erwear. Chloe presented show stoppingly beautiful\nsnow queen-esque pieces flung over white chiffon\ndresses. Marc Jacob\u2019s cloaks were short and velvet\nin shimmering jewel tones, and Alber Elbaz made\nhis longer and sleeker for a touch of sixties mystery at Lanvin. John Galliano\u2019s last show at Christian\nDior lacked no drama either as Karlie Kloss strutted down the catwalk in knee high boots, a floppy\nwide brimmed hat and billowing black cape swirling\nbehind her.\nFull of drama yet elegantly draped, its hard to go\nwrong with a cape.\nTHE PICK:\nEmilio Pucci\u2019s girls strutted dark mysterious pieces\nembellished with baroque swirls this season, calling\ninto mind the misty forests of a fairy tale adventure.\nPerhaps a little less heavy, yet with just enough detail to carry you from day to night, Wallis\u2019 version too\nwill wrap you up perfectly for a midnight stroll.\nFendi\n\u00a314,960\nMiss\nSelfridge\n\u00a365\nCeline\nTopshop\n\u00a3100\nJason\nWu\n\u00a31,510\nMango\n\u00a355\nEmilio\nPucci\n\u00a36,695\nWallis\n\u00a375\n\n"

Standing tall in\nboth stature and talent even at their admirable\nages of 78 (Redgrave) and 80 (Jones), the two\nveterans still command the stage like never\nbefore, and it is precisely their excellent performances that make this production of \u201cDriving Miss Daisy\u201d worth every penny, which is\nwhy this very limited 12-week engagement in\nWyndhams Theatre, Leicester Square is an experience you cannot afford to miss.\nIt would be hard not to compare any adaption\nof \u201cDriving Miss Daisy\u201d to the Oscar-winning\nhit film which starred the sublime Jessica\nTandy and Morgan Freeman in the lead roles,\nwhich Redgrave and Jones take over respec-tively. In the role of Miss Daisy Werthan, a\nfrail, old yet proud and tough Southern Jewish\nwoman, Tandy obviously has the upper hand\nwith her more delicate features. Redgrave\non the other hand, towers at an astonishing\n5\u201911\u201dsomehow not immediately convincing as\na woman nearing death and someone who will\nhave to deal with the effects of Alzheimer\u2019s.\nBut fear not, for Redgrave\u2019s subtle yet hugely effective changes in both her posture and\nspeaking voice throughout the play make it obvious of Miss Daisy\u2019s deteriorating condition.\nShe starts off as a proud woman in a comfortable position who hates the idea of having to\nhire a chauffeur. After a bad crash for which\nMiss Daisy will forever blame her car rather\nthan her weakening driving skills, her concerned son, Boolie (the equally fantastic Boyd\nGaines in a crucial supporting role), eventually manages to employ a willing AfricanAmerican driver, Hoke Colburn (Jones). And\nso begins an unlikely yet touching story of\nfriendship that spans an era, having profound\ninfluence on both characters.\nThis is a play that thrives on subtleties. For\nthose familiar with the film, you will remember that racism, prejudice and civil rights\nmovements are what it focuses heavily on. For\na play on a stage and a budget with limitations,\nthe scope cannot be too broad, and even the\ncast only consists of the modest yet always-reliable three. We do see numerous brief pro-jection-reels that show the political changes\nin hate-filled America that are slowly moving\ntowards racial equality, but much is left out.\nThe social commentary underlying the script\nis merely hinted at, although never quite fully\naddressed. This is neither a compliment nor a\ncriticism of the play \u2013 it\u2019s a modest production\nmore interested in the spot-on actors.\nSo does it really matter that Redgrave doesn\u2019t\nquite hit all the unique distinctions of a Southern accent? Not at all. She adds so much detail,\ndepth and it is obvious she has given a lot of\ncareful attention to her performance. It is Miss\nDaisy\u2019s gradual decline that she portrays so\nwell on stage that there is no need for cheesy\nmusic (of which there is some, to fill the gaps\nof scene changes) to have that heart-wrench-ing finale. Her head gradually sinks into her\nshoulders, her walks become slower and more\nuneven, and she has difficulty walking down a\nflight of stairs. As the play begins, Redgrave\nshows Miss Daisy\u2019s feisty side by fighting\nJohn Park \u201cRedgrave adds so much\ndetail, depth and it is\nobvious she has given a\nlot of careful attention\nto her performance\u201d\noff her son\u2019s insistence to hiring a chauffeur\nwhilst making a pie, both tasks Redgrave marvellously masters in one clean swoop.\nMiss Daisy is initially sceptical of having a stranger in her home; she even accuses\nHoke of stealing a can of salmon, in a scene\nof genuine comedy in which Redgrave shines\nyet again, standing so upright and self-confi-dent, holding the empty can and pointing it\nat Hoke as if she\u2019s about to stab him with it.\nBut the wise and warm Hoke turns out to be\ninvaluable company as time goes by, whilst\nof course being an excellent, reliable driver.\nJones gives a firmer, more reserved perfor-mance, something that plays off perfectly with\nRedgrave\u2019s more frantic, wordy one. Despite\nthe abuse and humiliation he must have faced\nover the years because of his colour, Hoke is\nan unquestionably dignified man, a perfect\ngentleman who stands beside a woman who is\nsomewhat oblivious to what is going on in the\noutside world, without wanting to admit that\nshe is not perfect.\nIn a short period of time (the play wraps up\nneatly at around 90 minutes), director David\nEsbjorson has a lot to cover, and he chooses to\ngo about the material with many time jumps,\noccasionally reminding the audience of what\nyear we\u2019re in with clumsy captions that are\nprojected in the background. The result is\nmany narrative breaks; patchy work and a\ndisjointed structure that make many scenes\nfeel episodic. But the each scene has merit of\nits own, thanks largely to the unquestionably\ngood duo. The final scene has impact, perhaps\nnot as powerful as what the film managed to\ncapture, but it\u2019s quiet and potent in its own\nway and certainly puts a beautiful end to a\nlow-key, memorable production.\nDriving Miss Daisy runs at the Wyndhams\nTheatre until December 17\nThis is actually how Darth Vader steered the Death Star. Probably\n\n"

    "content": "POLITICS\nFELIX\n14 FRIDAY 14 october 2011\nI\nhave a confession to make. Over\nthe last year or so, I\u2019ve been really quite evil. I really never\nmeant to be, but there it is. Evil\nas a doorknob. Like many of my\nilk, I can pin point the exact day the evil\nstarted, it was in November 2009 and I\nwas in the Felix office, chatting to the\nBusiness Editor. The chat went something like this:\nMoi: The government should really\npay for education/ health/ hash brownies for the poor.\nSatan: Well, if it\u2019s such a good thing,\nwhy don\u2019t richer people just pay for it\nfor them anyway? Can\u2019t people just be\ncharitable, or are you saying the government is more moral than everyone\nelse?\nAnd there the bastard had me.\nWouldn\u2019t it be a whole lot better if\npeople just came together themselves\nand sorted out each other\u2019s difficulties?\nWhat was it that made government intervention so much better than private\naction? This got around a WHOLE load\nof issues too. Want your child to learn\nevolution? Set up a school that does it.\nWant poor kids to learn about evolution?\nSet up a school for them too. Is it really\nthat different from the government doing it? In fact, it should be better - being controlled from near, not Whitehall,\nmeans better efficiency and accountabil-ity. On top of that, surely the freedom to\nteach as you wish has a moral value to\nit? It\u2019s not like current state schools are\nanything to write home about. Assuming you can write, that is.\nI started to see the benefits of privatisation everywhere. I didn\u2019t believe that\ncuddly services such as health and education should be run purely in pursuit\nof profit, rather that the freedom should\nbe given to professionals, patients and\nparents to make their own decisions\nabout services and this freedom comes\nfrom privatisation. Every time someone\ncomplained that the government should\ndo more for such and such I\u2019d think,\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you just go ahead and do\nit, or convince professionals to?\u201d At\nevery stage this was my outlook. How\non earth could the government do something better than its citizens, I thought.\nYes, most of us don\u2019t have the expertise\nto set up a school, but neither do most\npoliticians. They hire professionals with\nour money, why not cut out the middleman and hire them ourselves?\nBut I wasn\u2019t an evil voice in the wil-derness, I had my Gospel and I read it\nreligiously; The Economist magazine.\nYou really have to read the thing to understand its allure, but basically it kept\nme in market- loving, unions-hating\nrapture for hours on end every week.\nAnd when my sister got me a Kindle\nsubscription for Christmas? In the Holy\nName of Friedman, I just didn\u2019t stand\na chance.\nIt all reached its zenith when, one\nfateful May morning, I put an x beside\nthe name of Sir Malcolm Rifkind, Conservative MP for Kensington. Yes, that\u2019s\nright. I\u2019m Rory the Tory. Rory the Milk\nSnatcher. The Sheriff of Ror-ingham.\nBut things have since changed. Let\nme be clear, I really didn\u2019t mean to be\nevil. I honestly believed in the freedom,\nefficiency and accountability that letting the market into public goods would\nbring. I now realise I was mistaken. The\npurpose of this article is to explain just\nwhy I was mistaken: why markets really\naren\u2019t as wonderful as free marketers\nsuch as my younger self might hope.\nPerhaps in the process some other poor\ndevils might realise the errors of their\nmarket-orientated ways, too.\nFirstly, I have no problem with fruit and\nneither do markets. We\u2019re talking about\nLemons with a capital \u2018L\u2019; crap cars. It\u2019s\na well known fact that the very second\nyou drive a new car out of the car shop,\nit drops fabulously in price in a way that\ndoesn\u2019t make perfect sense. It\u2019s true that\neveryone likes the idea of being the first\nowner of a car, but not so much that they\nwould insist on paying many thousands\nof pounds less just because someone had\n\u2018her\u2019for a week. Instead, there\u2019s a classic\nmarket failure operating.\nImagine you see an ad for a car. It\u2019s almost new and so going for a price not too\nfar off what it would have been hot off\nthe shelves (that\u2019s how a car shop works,\nright? Shelves and massive industrial\ntrolleys?). It seems like a good deal, but\nsomething\u2019s bugging you. If the car\u2019s really so good, why is the guy trying to sell\nit? Sure you can give it a test drive and\ncheck out the MOT, but all that already\ntakes up time and time is money, already\nmaking the car more expensive. And\neven if the MOT etc. checks out you\u2019ll\nstill be left wondering why this car\u2019s on\nsale - unless it\u2019s faulty? Because you\ndon\u2019t know everything there is to know\nabout the car, there\u2019ll always be that\ndoubt. Coupled with the extra money\nand time it takes to check the car out, this\nmeans that inevitably you\u2019re going to offer a lower price than the seller should\nreally get for the car, to compensate for\nthe uncertainty.\nBut now look at it from the car owner\u2019s\nperspective; he realises that if he tries to\nsell the car, the above reasons will mean\nhe gets a poor price. Which means that\nunless there is an emergency (a new\nbaby, unemployment) he has little incentive to sell a perfectly good car. Unless,\nof course, it\u2019s faulty. Then he still has every incentive to get rid of the thing.\nAnd now we can see that both buyer\nand seller will create a spiral; the buyer\nis scared of Lemons so he offers a low\nprice, the seller doesn\u2019t like the low price\nso he only sells if he has a Lemon which\nmeans even more used cars are Lemons\nwhich means the buyer will offer even\nless to compensate for the risk and so on.\nThis isn\u2019t so bad if it only affects cars and\nmanufactures now offer guarantees on\nused cars to alleviate this, though it\u2019s still\nan issue. The big problem is the exact\nsame market failure exists in healthcare\n- just as Lemons are more likely to be put\nup for sale, sick people are more likely\nto take out health insurance; pushing up\nits price and driving healthy people out,\nfurther pushing up the price. People getting lower prices than they would like for\ntheir cars is OK, but sick people finding\nthemselves priced out of insurance really\nisn\u2019t. There is a clear case for government intervention here. This leads us to\nthe next market failure:\nOne little piggy went to market\nRory Fenton talks about his struggles with free market and government interaction\nbut if the other guy \u2018fesses up things are\nreversed, he gets 2 years you get ten. If\nyou both confess, you get 5 years each.\nA confusing state of affairs, but it\u2019s clear\nthat the best result for both is to keep qui-et. The problem is, since neither of them\ncan be sure the other won\u2019t say anything,\nthe most rational move for each is to con-fess, rather than run the risk of being the\nonly silent one. All things being equal,\nkeeping quiet gets you an average of 5\nyears locked, speaking out gets you just\n3.5. Two rational prisoners will always\ntell on each other, leaving both unnecessarily in prison.\nThere are many real world examples\nof this, an obvious one being hygiene.\nSandwich shops, for example, would\nhave no incentive to spend a small sum\non making clean sandwiches if it means\nmaking them slightly less competitive\nthan rivals, despite the fact that sandwich\nshops making people ill is bad for the\nindustry as a whole. Clearly businesses\nneed educated workers and yet it makes\nno sense for any individual business to\ninvest in schools if those guys are just\ngoing to work for someone else. Again,\nthere\u2019s a clear case for government intervention here.\n\u201cCan\u2019t people\njust be charitable,\nor are you saying\nthe government is\nmore moral than\neveryone else?\n\u201d\nPolitics Editors: Rajat Jain\nJoseph Letts\npolitics.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nMarket Failure\nThe Prisoners\u2019 Dilemma\nHalfway to Damascus\nEven in theory, markets can\u2019t always work\nproperly. A year ago, I\u2019d have said that if\nthere were a more efficient way of doing\nsomething, the market would always find\nit and adopt it, because otherwise businesses wouldn\u2019t survive. Unfortunately,\nthis isn\u2019t the case and market failures can\nappear in two fundamental ways:\nThe Problem of Lemons\nThis one\u2019s a nice economics parable.\nThere are two recently arrested prisoners\nbeing interrogated separately by police.\nWhatever evidence the police have, it\u2019s\nnot enough for a conviction. The prisoners are each given a choice; either own\nup to what you and your friend did, in\nwhich case you get 2 years in prison and\nthe other guy 10, or you can keep quiet\nI was gradually convinced that markets,\nhowever rational, could never fully create\nthe optimal outcome for everyone and,\nsadly, it\u2019s the poorest who would lose out\nthe most. I\u2019m no commie, mind, but these\nare sensible reasons for a well regulated\nmarket system with social welfare and\npublic goods. I haven\u2019t changed alto-gether. In an election tomorrow, I would\nstill vote Tory (they\u2019re hardly full on free\nmarketers these days) and I don\u2019t necessarily support every last penny spent in\nthe name of welfare. So I\u2019m a long way\nfrom skipping down a small country lane\nwith pretty petals in my hair nursing an\ninjured baby rabbit, but the evil has re-scinded, somewhat. Unlike, alas, that tattoo of Thatcher on my shoulder\u2026\n\n"

The\nshow (or at least its first episode) received rave\nreviews and is from the creators of Peep Show,\na programme which can generally guarantee a\ngood laugh.\nOf course the biggest draw was the University\nsetting: I generally find comedy dealing with\nthings that I am familiar with far more engag-ing. Here I found my first disappointment. A\ngood comedy can often make fun of a mundane\nsituation by taking it to extremes but I feel Fresh\nMeat takes it too far. It feels nothing at all like my\nstudent experience, there\u2019s nothing recognisable\nthat could make the show a personally poignant\nexperience.

If you\u2019re feeling down, have a look at some\nother people\u2019s problems.\nW\nriting reviews on\nshows I love is something I have found\nto be quite difficult.\nWhen I try to persuade someone to watch something I like,\nit generally ends with me saying \u201cErm,\nyeah, you just need to watch it, cos it\u2019s\namazing.\u201d And reviewing a show like\nLOST is even harder, because I never\nwant to give away too much, because it\u2019s\nthe secrets and surprises that make it so\nenjoyable.\nI\u2019ll be honest with you. I was quite a\nlate-comer to LOST, mostly due to my\nown skepticism. I mean, it\u2019s just a bunch\nof people who crash on an island and try\nto survive, right? That\u2019s been done so\nmany times; it\u2019s hard to keep count. Oh,\nhow very wrong I was\u2026\nThe pilot episode, which incidentally\nwas the most expensive pilot ever made\ncosting between $10-14 million, introduces the viewers to the survivors of Oceanic\nFlight 815, flying from Sydney to LosAngeles, which crashes on an island somewhere in the South Pacific. For you avid\nreaders out there you will quickly draw\nparallels with Treasure Island and Lord\nof the Flies as the first couple of episodes\nexplore the makings of a hierarchical soci-ety. That\u2019s pretty much where most similarities to other island survival shows end.\nThe first night on the island is spent building a fire and trying to understand why\nthe jungle makes strange metallic noises\nwhilst trees topple left, right and center.\nThe next day, a brave group goes into the\njungle to try and send a distress call from\nthe cockpit. They manage to find a transceiver and even the pilot is alive, but he is\nsoon killed by the unseen monster. Craziness ensues as other survivors encounter a\npolar bear, build a golf course and hear a\nmayday, in French, that has been repeating on a loop from somewhere on the island for 16 years. Weird stuff\u2026\nWhy did they crash? Where did they\ncrash? Why did these specific people sur-vive? Those are just a few of the questions\nthat audiences ask themselves when they\nwatch this show. That\u2019s the wonderful \u2013\nand infuriating \u2013 thing about LOST: every\nanswer just leads to more questions. This\ncan get a bit annoying and I do know a\nfew people who simply gave up after a\nfew seasons of increasingly complicated\nplotlines. If you are such a person, I recommend you go back to the beginning\nand watch the whole thing all over again,\nbecause this really is the kind of show one\nneeds to watch back-to-back in order to\nfully appreciate it.And the majority of the\nquestions do get answered by the end of\nseason six.\nAnd what is there to appreciate, you\nask? Well, let\u2019s start with the location: Hawaii! The beautiful scenery and sudden\nday-turning-into-night-end-of-the-world-type-weather makes it the perfect setting.\nThen there\u2019s the music, as composed by\nMichael Giacchino, which in a way, has\ncome to define the show. In fact, I\u2019m\npretty sure it was when I started watching\nLost that I came to fully appreciate just\nhow important the music in a television\nshow can be. Just the main tune \u2018There\u2019s\nNo Place Like Home\u2019 manages to be\nheart-wrenching, yet oddly uplifting at the\nsame time. Genius.\nAs I already mentioned in previous re-views, the thing that\u2019s most important to\nme in a series are the characters. If they\u2019re\nnot interesting or don\u2019t develop, I just\ntune out. Thankfully, LOST is jampacked\nwith character development and intrigu-thoroughly obnoxious JP as soon as she arrives\nbecause she is convinced by her new housemates\nthat this is the sort of thing one does during the\nfirst week at University. Or Oregon, who is so at\npains to conceal her studious, middle class background - despite none of her friends really caring about it - that she lies about having a car and\nhaving done well at school. Or Kingsley, who\ndecides to switch from geology to drama after\nonly a few days to try to get girls and avoid one\nsomewhat annoying lecturer.\nOf course not everybody will care about this\nand I guess that some might even find the situations presented somewhat familiar. I\u2019d be the\nfirst to admit that I\u2019m hardly the typical student,\nmore like the unsociable and never seen Paul\nthan any of the other characters. As such its only\nto be expected that I don\u2019t find their problems\nfamiliar. Perhaps this makes me unqualified to\ncomment on the show, but I daresay that there are\nmore than a couple people like me at Imperial.\nNone of this would really matter if the show\nwas at least funny, but it simply isn\u2019t. I can\u2019t\nreally explain it - I just didn\u2019t laugh a lot while\nwatching it. When I did it was mainly from embarrassment at the often puerile jokes. In fact, I\nfound the more \u2018dramatic\u2019 elements of the show\n- like awkward Howard\u2019s attempts to get a date\nwith outgoing Voz - far more interesting.\nThis is by no means a horrible show and you\nshould probably check out at least one episode\nto see if it\u2019s your sort of thing - just don\u2019t expect\nanything brilliant.\nHave your say\non this or any\nother article at\nfelixonline.co.uk\n\u201cSwitch from Geology to\nDrama after three days\nto get more girls\u201d\nMaciej Matuszewski\nNew comedy series has more sex than Imperial, dammit\nFresh Meat deserves a roasting\nSometimes answers just lead to more questions\nLucia Podhorska takes a retrospective look at LOST\nTELEVISION\nCould you write a review of Hidden, DCI Banks, The Great British Bake-Off, Educating\nEssex, One Man One Jar, Blue Bloods, House, or ANYTHING?

    "content": "TELEVISION\nFELIX Friday 14 October 2011 31\nJeremy Kyle \u2018guests\u2019 should cease breeding\nThe Jeremy Kyle Show... wow. Where\nto start? I suppose I could start by telling\nyou that the comedian Jim Davidson once\nsuggested that the producers of the show\ncatch the vermin who appear on it outside Lidl with a large net. Or I could tell\nyou that a judge called it \u201chuman bearbating\u201d. Or perhaps that it\u2019s also been described by a Labour MPas a \u201cmodern day\nfreak show\u201d.\nEpisodes usually fall into four catego-ries; \u2018heartwarmers\u2019 (where someone has\na genuine disability or issue that the show\nhelps them out with by funding treatment\nor some other form of help) - meh, bor-ing. Rehab episodes, still boring. The\nfinal two involve either DNA or lie detector tests; this is where the real shit goes\ndown. In case you aren\u2019t familiar with\nthe show, here are a few example episode\ntitles: \u201cI\u2019m A Binge Drinker And A Drug\nDealer, But I\u2019ll Be A Great Dad!\u201d, \u201cMy\nKids Are Black and Angry!\u201d, \u201cWhy Do\nYou Nag Us About the Heating Costing So Much and Then Leave Windows\nWide Open?\u201d (could be a reference to my\nhousemate...), \u201cWho\u2019s Father To Your\nBaby? Me Or My Dad?\u201d and my personal\nfavourite \u201cWhy Deny Paternity Just Because the Baby Is Ginger?\u201d. I think we all\nknow the answer to that one.\nI don\u2019t know what annoys me most\nabout the Jezza K show. The fact that\nthese people exist, the fact that most of\nthem are unemployed and are leeching\noff the government because they\u2019re too\ndamn lazy to get a job, or the fact that they\nare just incredibly rude. How can they be\nwilling to go on national television in\nfront of a reported 1.8 million viewers to\nsort out their problems if they cant even\nlisten to Jeremy without interrupting him\nevery 4 seconds. But then again that\u2019s\nwhat you expect from these people, they\nneed educating; in life, manners, decency,\nEnglish (I doubt the participants even\nknow what grammar is) and arguably\nGeorge Barnett\nmost importantly - how to use a condom\n(we don\u2019t want to breed a generation of\nretards now, do we?).\nOn a somewhat more political note, it\nshocks me that these people are allowed\nto vote. Most seem to be less intelligent\nthan the average three-year-old. These are\nthe sort of people who are quite happy to\nshag their partner\u2019s parents, they think being a good father is buying an Xbox 360\nand a 32\u201d TV instead of spending time\nwith their children, they think being a\ngrandmother and having a swingers party\nis normal. That\u2019s just disgusting, there\nare things you just shouldn\u2019t do at certain\nages. Just imagine it, a granny who looks\nand probably smells worse than a bulldog\u2019s dirty arsehole having an orgy. Eugh.\nIt probably sounds like I detest the Jeremy Kyle Show. But you\u2019d be wrong to\njump to conclusions - it\u2019s quality; daytime\ntelevision at its best. It may well be \u201chuman bear-bating\u201d, but to be honest it\u2019s\nfunnier than a penguin playing a banjo. In\none show, a woman who had slept with\ntwo men in as many days (one of them\nbeing her ex with whom she already has\na child with) ran on stage and punched\naforementioned ex in the face before\nrunning off stage again. She was then restrained by a vast amount of hired muscle\nwhilst Jeremy explained to her why what\nshe did was wrong. Her response? \u201cNah\nmate. Naaah mate. Naaaaah\u201d. Fucking chav. She then decided that the best\ncourse of action would be to run off and\nsmash a window. Clever girl.\nI do wonder whether it\u2019s wrong to laugh\nat these people though; because they\nclearly do have some serious issues, and\nI do genuinely feel sorry for the people\nwho get caught up in it all - those who\nget abused by some prick on drugs, or the\nchildren who are born into already broken\nand dysfunctional families. I even feel\nsorry for the guy who was stabbed just because he was covered in tattoos - although\nhe did look like a bit of a knob (and has\nlegally changed his name to King Of Ink\nLand King Body Art The Extreme InkIte). However, I always come to the same\nconclusion: no, it\u2019s not wrong. It\u2019s just\ntoo bloody funny to not laugh. Besides,\nit does wonders for your ego to know that\nyou will never be as shit a person as they\nare.\nVictims of reduced gene pool descend dignity ladder\n\u201cWhy deny paternity\njust because the\nbaby is ginger?\u201d\nEmail tv.felix@ic.ac.uk to write for us!\nHis Majesty the King of Ink-Land - he looks like something out of fucking\nAvatar\ning characters, whom we get to know both\non and off the island, thanks to the brilliant use of flashbacks, flash-forwards and\nflash-sideways. There\u2019s not really any actor who doesn\u2019t deliver, but there are a few\nthat need mentioning for their outstanding\nperformances: Matthew Fox as Dr. Jack\nShepherd; Terry O\u2019Quinn as John Locke\nand Michael Emerson as the creepy Ben\nLinus, both of whom received an Emmy\nfor Outstanding Supporting Actor In A\nDrama Series.\nCreated by J.J.Abrams \u2013 the man behind\nAlias, Fringe and the new Star Trek movie\n\u2013 and Damon Lindelof, LOST ran for six\nseasons and explored a larger panoply of\nthemes than other Hollywood shows have.\nMortality, religion, relationships and the\nhuman condition are all investigated.

A\ndetailed analysis that satirizes modern\nsociety can be derived with little effort as\nwell which generates great conversation if\nyou find yourself with similarly minded\npeople.\nThe brilliance of the show comes from\nits innate ability to appeal to all audiences.\nDog lovers, science fiction fans, scientist\nand adventurous shoot-em\u2019-up junkies all\nhave their slice of pizza to enjoy.

    "content": "Yes \u2013 James Clough No \u2013 Ed Middleton\nIC Debating Society asks ...\nO\nsama bin Laden was, for the past\ndecade, the human face the Western\nWorld gave to al-Qaeda. He was the\nliving embodiment of Islamic Terror.\nHis ability to elude the most powerful militaries and intelligence agencies for years\ngave him an untouchable aura. As such, removing\nbin Laden from al-Qaeda\u2019s chain of command and\ndestroying him as a figurehead was an important\nact. It was a symbol of victory in the War on Terror.\nBut the secretive manner of his death means that\nhe, and al-Qaeda, retain their air of mystery. Bin\nLaden is now a martyr for the cause. Imagine if\nAmerica had captured bin Laden. They could have\ndemonstrated their victory publicly, humiliating\nhim without having to kill him. They would still\nhave seen all the benefits of killing him: removing\nhis capacity to assist and direct al-Qaeda, emasculating a former inspiration for prospective suicide\nbombers, and proving that al-Qaeda could not outsmart the West, but there would have been further\nbenefits to capturing bin Laden and giving him a\ntrial.\nHe could have been questioned, and there is a\npossibility that he could have provided invaluable\ninformation. Demonstrating the capability to capture such a prized target would have provided a\nmuch greater deterrent to potential terrorists than\nkilling him; most of them are happy to be killed for\ntheir cause, whereas decades in a foreign prison is a\nmuch less appealing prospect. Imprisonment would\nhave provided a greater punishment for bin Laden\nthan death, and seeing him suffer this punishment\nwould have given families of his victims a greater\nsense of closure.\nWe must also consider the justice of bin Laden\u2019s\nassassination. Though it is easy to say that he deserved to be killed for the murders he committed,\nby retaliating in kind America only reinforced the\nnarrative spread by militant Islamists: the West are\nunjust oppressors. If America really believes it is\nfighting the good fight, it cannot act in the same\nway as its enemy. It must openly and publicly behave in a more just, legal and measured way than\nthe people it is trying to tell us are the bad guys. In\na war of ideas, it cannot afford to compromise on\nthe liberal Western values it claims to fight for, else\nit will lose legitimacy at home and abroad. Even if\nwe believe that America was morally justified in\nits killing of bin Laden, we must admit that if this\nconflict is to end it will not be because we kill every\nsingle terrorist; it will be because they won\u2019t have a\nreason to be terrorists any more.\nPerhaps it would have been more difficult to capture bin Laden than to kill him, but it is reasonable\nto believe that it would have been possible to arrest\nhim and bring him to trial; and in any case, given\nthat bin Laden was unarmed when he was shot, it\nseems that capturing bin Laden was never an option America were willing to consider.\nBringing bin Laden to trial would have been\nmore just, legal and impressive. It would have humiliated al-Qaeda with a public defeat. It would\u2019ve\nshown the whole world the difference between the\nWest and al-Qaeda, it would\u2019ve been a more effective way to help win the War on Terror, and it\nwould\u2019ve sent the strongest possible message that\nthe West are the good guys. If America had captured bin Laden, they could have given him the\ndeath sentence, giving us the same end result. But\nbecause they killed him there and then, the opportunity to do the right thing has been lost. Bin Laden\nwould surely have preferred death to capture. This,\nas much as anything, tells us thatAmerica made the\nwrong choice, and that bin Laden was able to have\nthe last laugh after all.\nW\ne have the wolf by the ears;\nand we can neither hold\nhim, nor safely let him go.\nJustice is in one scale, and\nself-preservation in the other.\u201d These words spoken by Thomas Jefferson fittingly describe the quandary faced by the Western\nworld when fighting the War on Terror; and let us\nbe clear about this, we are indeed fighting a war.\nThe nature of warfare has changed since the days\nof soldiers standing in an open field wearing their\nnation\u2019s banner. In the age of globalisation, war is\nfought over great distances by splinter cells comprised of anonymous soldiers. In 1998, Osama bin\nLaden declared war on the Western world and in\n2001 George Bush reciprocated. Osama bin Laden\nwas a soldier in that war and his death was one of\nthe many casualties. Here I will show you why the\ndeath of Osama bin Laden was justified as an act\nof war, and why the alternatives made this the only\nviable option.\nWhen fighting against an opposition comprised\nof splinter groups and isolated cells, the chain of\ncommand that links and organises these cells becomes a very significant strategic target. Osama\nbin Laden was also pivotal in uniting al-Qaeda,\nrecruiting new soldiers and funding a number of\ntheir operations. It was for these reasons that he\nwas killed. The United States discovered the location of a high-value target (HVT), crucial in the\nrunning of al-Qaeda and had it removed, as you\nwould any other military target. There have been\nno calls to bring the countless al-Qaeda soldiers\nfighting in Afghanistan to trial, so why should\nOsama bin Laden be different? People often cite\nexamples such as Adolf Eichmann and Charles\nTaylor, where those implicated in war crimes were\ntried in an international court. However, in both\nthese instances the conflict had ended and the individuals provided no strategic advantage in an ongoing war. As such, they were not counted as valid\nmilitary targets.\nNow we will look at the alternative to killing\nOsama bin Laden: trial. This already assumes that\nan alternative was possible \u2013 that he could and\nwould allow himself to be taken alive. Resistance\nwas encountered by the US SEALS who sought\nto capture or kill Osama bin Laden and it may not\nhave been possible to capture him without giving\nhim ample opportunity to escape or take his own\nlife.\nMany people claim a trial would have been a far\nbetter outcome than killing him. The purpose of\na trial is to identify the level of involvement and\nguilt of a party in a crime and provide an opportunity for the event to be analysed and investigated\npublicly. A trial of Osama bin Laden would be redundant on both these counts. Firstly, not only is\nthere irrefutable evidence condemning Osama bin\nLaden, but he has also confessed to the atrocities\nlisted against him. Secondly, the chain of events\nsurrounding Osama bin Laden\u2019s crimes is already\nwell documented. If this has not been done to a\nsatisfactory level then there is still an opportunity\nto lead a public investigation or put him to trial\n\u2018post-mortem\u2019.\nAny case that opposes the killing of Osama bin\nLaden on the grounds that he should have been\nput to trial does not appreciate the fact that the\nWar on Terror IS a war and one that is on-going.\nOsama bin Laden was killed as a soldier in that\nwar. Bringing the War on Terror to a conclusion\nas swiftly and bloodlessly as possible is a greater\npriority than acting out a trial for mere show pur-poses, while endangering the lives of more innocent civilians the world over.\nShould Osama bin\nLaden have been\nbrought to trial?\n\u201c \u201d\nIf America really believes\nit is fighting the good\nfight, it cannot act in the\nsame way as its enemy\n\u201c \u201d\n... the War on Terror IS\na war and one that is\non-going. Osama bin\nLaden was killed as a\nsoldier in that war\nWhenever I\u2019m down, I think about the\n72 virgins awaiting ...

    "content": "COMMENT\nA\nguy got on the tube and\nsat down next to me last\nweek, which is a momentous enough event for me\nto open the column with\nbecause being that close to another\nhuman is a sure-fire way to ruin my\nweek in spectacular style. Fortunately\nfor me, the chap in question pulled out\nan iPhone and opened the notes app,\nwhere he began adding to a list \u2013 a list\nwhich would turn out to be the highlight of the day.\nThe list was topped with the words\n\u201cBE DO HAVE\u201d, like the half-finished\nlyrics to a jazz freestyle session, and\nunderneath was all manner of seemingly disconnected phrases. \u201cLive In\nFrance\u201d. \u201cSing At A Club\u201d. \u201cLearn\nTo Tango\u201d. At first I assumed he was\nmaking a list of things that he couldn\u2019t\npossibly do when dressed like he was.\nHowever as my eyes progressed down\nthe list the items started growing considerably stranger and shed more and\nmore light on what the list\u2019s real purpose was, until I had to stifle a chuckle\nas I came across the entry \u201cTravel to a\npacific island and take those strong hallucinogenic drugs they have\u201d.\nGoogle later confirmed that \u201cBe,\nDo, Have\u201d was some self-motivational\nsystem for something called - among\nother things - The Law Of Attraction.\nThe idea being that by writing down the\nperson you want to be, and the things\nthat person would do or have, you mentally bring yourself closer to being that\nway. Or, as I like to think of it, by writing down the person you want to be,\nand the things that person would do or\nhave, you allow yourself to avoid actually doing any of those things and just\nthink about them instead. Hooray for\nself-help.\nThere are good intentions behind\nsome of this stuff, if you look for it hard\nenough. It suggests that by adopting the\nmentality of a person who is fit and\nhealthy, for instance, that you\u2019ll avoid\neating things that are bad for you because a fit and healthy person wouldn\u2019t\ndo that. Right? That\u2019s fine. That\u2019s a logical thing to do. At some point the logic\nbreaks down though, usually around the\ntime that they start talking about mil-lionaires.\n\u201cYou must BE the millionaire first,\nlong before you actually have the money in your bank account!\u201d the website\nproclaims unhelpfully. \u201cHow would\na millionaire think? How would they\nmake decisions?\u201d to which the logical\nresponse seems to be, \u201cThey would\nthrow money at the decision, because\nthey are a millionaire.\u201d And if it\u2019s not\nthat response, then I don\u2019t know what\nthey\u2019re getting at. Most millionaires\nI know of have pretty poor decision-making skills.\nThe guy\u2019s list went on: \u201cLive in silence for a week\u201d. \u201cSpend a night\nsleeping alone on a deserted island\u201d. I\ndon\u2019t know what kind of person he was\ntrying to visualise but it seemed to be\nthe lead character in a Danny Boyle\nmovie. There was nothing on the list\nabout eating your own weight in ice\ncream, or painting a gigantic wang on\nthe side of an Olympic billboard. What\nkind of aspirations were these anyway?\nThis is why I stray away from making\nlong-term dreams too specific. Once\nyou start to write them down and focus\n\u201cpositive energies\u201d on them, or whatever schlock you\u2019ve been told to do,\nyou start setting yourself timers. Little,\ninsignificant reminders like the ones on\nyour phone that don\u2019t work very well\nand just irritate you with their whin-ing. Every day that goes by with you\n\u201cvisualising\u201d these dreams rather than\nactually achieving them will be another\ncontribution to your inevitable, crippling sense of worthlessness. Which\nwill probably lead you to making more\nlists, and feeling more useless when\nthey don\u2019t get you anywhere.\nIt\u2019s far easier to just stick to doing\nwhat you enjoy, right now, and leave the\nworrying about where it leads for later,\nparticularly if you\u2019re young enough to\nbe at Imperial. Learning to tango while\nyour head\u2019s being rammed with peyote isn\u2019t going to make you any more\nwhole as a person than buying the new\nElder Scrolls game and going to a half-decent fireworks display.\nSo there. Watch out this week for my\n\u00a315 pamphlet series: \u201cGiving A Fuck\nAnd You: Self-Empowerment Through\nNot Caring\u201d.\nThe unhelpfulness\nof self-help\nAngry Geek\nThe box was opened. It turned out Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s\ncat was alive and a fuck of a lot more hostile than\nbefore\n\u201c\ng\ne\ns\n-,\n,\n,\nn\n\u201d\n... insignificant reminders like\nthe ones on your phone that\ndon\u2019t work very well and just\nirritate you with their whining\nUniversity College London (UCL) this week announced their planned adoption of the American-style grade point average system in lieu of\ntraditional degree classifications. Naturally, this\nraises the question as to whether UCL are leading the charge against a \u201ccrude and undistinguished\u201d system in an attempt to improve the\nvalue of a degree, or whether they are simply\nhoping to ensure easier comparison with American institutions.\nA prime issue with the new system that should\nbe considered is the effect that it could potentially have on students themselves. The grade\npoint average system, existing as an average\nof the numerical grades received across all ex-ams, allows for an even greater comparison and\nranking between students.\nWhile there is truth in the sentiment that competition encourages subsequent determination,\nsuch competition may also generate additional\npressure on students already striving to be the\nbest in one of the most academically tough and\nrigorous institutions that the country has to of-fer.\nThe current system of degree classifications\nallows some room for manoeuvre in terms of\nstudents who may inadvertently perform less\nwell than expected during an exam. Indeed, all\nit takes in some cases is one \u2018bad exam\u2019 for an\noverall average to significantly drop. Cases like\nthis are not rare, and an encouragement of a\nmore detailed ranking of students may heighten the tensions that the end of year inevitably\nbrings with it.\nIn many cases the current classifications allow employers to see where a student roughly\nstands academically, without becoming entangled in comparing individual marks. A move to\nthe new system could easily remove the meaning of interviews \u2013 to demonstrate capabilities\nbesides academic prowess.\nGrade inflation must be tackled, of course.\nEven so, it is not a problem wholly unique to\nhigher education.

I wanted\nto discover the sights, sounds and smells of a\nforeign land for myself without feeling obligated to visit all the suggested attractions in a\ntravel guide. However, after realising a return\nflight to anywhere \u201cremote and unexplored\u201d\nwould involve spending at least a month\u2019s rent,\nI felt that ignoring Ryanair\u2019s mid-season sale\nwould just be cutting off my nose to spite my\nface \u2013 a city break in Berlin it was.\nConsulting my Berlin RoughGuide mere\nminutes after landing at Schonefeld airport (a\ngood ten miles or so away from the actual ter-minal, but who cares about that when you\u2019ve\nlanded on \u201cyet another on-time flight\u201d as I was\ninformed by the spectacularly cringe worthy\nRyanair jingle), I was struck by how much like\nhard work this holiday was going to be, if we\nwere going to fit in all the must-sees/eats/dos -and at times it was. Yes, I had a great time, but\nwere there sights I wish I hadn\u2019t wasted time\non? Definitely. So here is what I would limit my\nefforts on were I to re-do my time in Berlin, in\nWishing You Were Here\nTravel tales wanted!\nCalling all pretentious gap yahs and casual back-packers! Been travelling this summer? Felix Travel\nwants the lowdown on all your adventures. If you\nhave anything \u2013 whether it\u2019s a hilarious anecdote\nor helpful destination guide \u2013 send it to us now at\ntravel.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nsculptures, posters and jewellery. Finally, the\nEast Side Gallery - a long stretch of what is left\nof the Berlin wall that has been painted with\npolitically themed murals - is categorically\nworth a small detour to East Berlin.\nNow, the way I\u2019ve tailored my second day\nmay not appeal to everyone - but as a huge history buff, I couldn\u2019t help but dedicate a serious\namount of time to the remnants of World War\nII in the city where it all began. The best way\nto see historical Berlin is a walking tour, and\nI would recommend the Original Berlin Walks\nThird Reich Sites Tour (www.berlinwalks.de).\nThe English-speaking tour guide knew every\ndetail of every story of every site we visited so\nwell that not only did I barely notice three hours\ngo by, but I felt like I\u2019d absorbed as much information in that space of time as I had all year at\nuniversity. Following up this walking tour with\nan afternoon at the Sachsenhausen concentration camp just outside of Berlin completed an\nenlightening and exceptionally poignant day.\nThe final day of any holiday always ought\nto be the most relaxed. The beautiful Schloss\nCharlottenburg, the largest palace in Berlin, is\nset in absolutely stunning grounds and backs\nonto the Schlosspark: \u201ca perfect place to relax in the summer\u201d. Within the palace itself,\nyou can take an audio-guided tour through the\nrooms. If you find you still have time left after exploring this magnificently restored 17th\ncentury structure, or even if you\u2019d rather spend\nyour last day engaging in less intellectually demanding activities (i.e. you save the last day to\nshop like me) and it happens to be a Sunday\nthen make time to pay a visit to the Mauerpakt\nflea market in Prenzlauer Berg. It\u2019s a market\nyou could spend hours meandering around,\nwith amazing finds in almost every stall - an\nexcellent place to spend your last euros. Lastly,\nif you are able to jump through the necessary\nhoops to land yourself on the list of permitted\nvisitors to the Reichstag then certainly do so -but don\u2019t sweat it if you can\u2019t.\nI\u2019ve saved the \u201ceats\u201d for last. While in Berlin, we discovered possibly the best frozen yoghurt in the world. If you do not visit Berlin\nfor any other reason, then stop there just for\nWonderpots, please. I could have spent hours\nsampling the many flavours and toppings available at this kitsch frozen-yoghurt caf\u00e9 situated\non Friedrichstrasse, the metropolitan hub of\nthe city. There was one aspect of Berlin that all\nthe planning in the world could not have made\nup for though - the currywurst. Even before I\ntried it, I had trouble understanding the appeal\nof the concept itself (seriously: frankfurters,\ncurry powder and ketchup?) and perhaps my\nculinary-inclined mind had raised my hopes too\nhigh for this German delicacy; excellent post-night-out kebab substitute maybe, but nothing\nmuch else.\n\u201cA perfect place to relax\nin the summer\u201d\nDushi Arumuganesan\nA long weekend of artistic pleasures and historical\ndelights: the perfect European city getaway\nBustling in vibrant Berlin\nWhat\u2019s in it for you?\nThis year the Felix Travel team are going to work\nwith writers to get you more freebies on the road:\ngain some writing experience over the year and\nwe\u2019ll show you how to go about approaching companies with writing proposals that\u2019ll heighten your\nbackpacking experience. We\u2019ve been reaping the\nrewards for a while, and are now we\u2019re ready to\nshare the secrets. So go on, get writing!\n\u2018Illuminated Berline Dome\u2019 by Michael Sohn\nThe only guy in town to show up to Holocaust memorial day in fancy dress...\norder to have a perfect (but probably culturally\nignorant) three days.\nBerlin is famed for its many (read: over 150)\nmuseums. Even after having narrowed that\nlist down to about ten, we struggled. My feet\nalmost died and I developed a temporary distaste for any form of culture put on show. In\nhindsight, if I could only visit one museum,\nI\u2019d make it the Hamburger Bahnhof. This is\nan especially good tip for any museum-phobe\nout there. It\u2019s a converted railway station now\nused to exhibit contemporary art, but you really\ndo forget that you\u2019re in a museum and not the\nold station as it was. I found myself spending\nas much time studying the infrastructure of the\nbuilding as I did the art itself. The massive steel\narches that hail you at the entrance, the cavernous rooms, and the underground passages - all\nof these lend an uncanny eeriness to some already eccentric and extraordinary displays of\nart, many of which are in video or audio form.\nMaking your way around this entire building\nwould make for an agreeable half day at least,\nif not longer for the keener art fan. In a creative\nmindset upon exit, I then headed to the Tacheles, an ex-Nazi prison. The building has been\ntaken over by a group of artists since the fall of\nthe Berlin wall and has been painted over on all\npossible surfaces with an impressive array of\nartwork. Within the building, artists hold workshops and sales of their work which include\n\n"

They start climbing over\ntheir drums and all kind of things are getting\nout of control. It\u2019s like this force of destiny, the\nfact that we don\u2019t control out lives and love is\nunpredictable. It\u2019s a kind of comedy of desires\nversus reality.

    "content": "FELIX Friday 14 October 2011 25\nARTS\nWatching a ballet from the wings is an\nexperience akin to glancing through an\nopen window into the life of a strang-er. A voyeuristic experience perhaps.\nDancers on a stage appear as magical and ethereal creatures, even in the\nmost human of roles. They are perfectly\npoised, every movement apparently ef-fortless. However, in ballet there is little\nthat can be done without effort.\n\u2018Jewels\u2019, choreographed by George\nBalanchine and danced by the Royal\nBallet, was a joy to behold from the\nwings of the Royal Opera House stage.\nThe corps dancers wandered around in\nleg warmers, joking with friends and\ntrying the more complicated steps one\nlast time before the performance. Tension and concentration was far more\npalpable in the faces of the principals.\nAs soon as the curtain rose however,\nintense professionalism took over the\nentire company. Ballerinas wore smiles\non stage, but these disappeared in an instant in the darkness of the wings, and\nwere usually replaced by grimaces or\ncursing. The final curtain calls brought\nrelief to the corps and ecstatic joy to the\nprincipals, who went home with arms\nfull of flowers . Ballet is tough, especially for those lowest in the hierarchy,\nbut this company showed that it does\nnot necessarily have to be tragic.\nA second ballet event took place last\nweek. A triple bill is currently playing\nat Covent Garden, showcasing the work\nof three British choreographers. The\nevening begins with \u2018Limen\u2019, a visually\nstunning piece devised by resident choreographer Wayne McGregor. The dancers move with virtuosity upon a stage lit\nby the digital artist Tatsuo Miyajima\u2019s\nLED projections, with an elegance that\nhas become McGregor\u2019s signature.\nEnding the evening was Kenneth McMillan\u2019s \u2018Requiem\u2019. It is a somewhat\nstilted ballet, with never-ending lifts\nand little in the way of dancing. Set to\nFaur\u00e9\u2019s Requiem, it is inevitably funereal in tone. However, Leanne Benjamin was soft and precise in her solos\nand Carlos Acosta, although minimally\ninvolved, lent some of his star quality to\nthe performance.\nThe real gem of the evening was undoubtedly \u2018Marguerite and Armand\u2019,\na Romantic ballet originally choreographed for Margot Fonteyn and Rudolf\nNureyev by Fredrick Ashton. The ballet itself is a captivating piece, Ashton\u2019s\nchoreography at its best to the Liszt piano sonata. It manages to compress Dumas\u2019 La Dame aux Cam\u00e8lias into half\nan hour without losing the essence. The\ndesigns and costumes are by the legendary Cecil Beaton, famous amongst other\nthings, for \u2018My Fair Lady\u2019.\nThe piece has been danced few times\nsince Fonteyn and Nureyev, but Tamara\nRojo and Sergei Polunin can compete\nwith the greats. With Polunin, the Royal\nBallet finally has a male dancer they can\nbe proud of. He not only has a phenom-The Royal Ballet Is Alive And Well\nA ballet from the wings and a strong triple bill made for two very special evenings\nat Covent Garden. Dance in Britain is going strong\n\u201cThe real gem of\nthe evening was undoubtedly Margurite\nand Armand\u201d\nenal jump and a forceful technique, but\nalso a raw talent for acting. As Armand,\nPolunin displays both these qualities\nand combines them to give a passionate\nperformance. Rojo is the ultimate tragic\nactress in ballet; and it is impossible\nnot to be moved by her Marguerite.\nMoreover, her technique is impeccably\nlight and she moves on the stage with\na rare security. Marguerite and Armand\nprovides the opportunity to see a ballet\npartnership with chemistry, something\nunfortunately too often missing in the\ndance world. One can only hope Rojo\nand Polunin will be partnered again\nsoon.\nLimen, Marguerite and Armand, Requiem: until 20th October at Covent\nGarden. Tickets from \u00a34\nEva Rosenthal\nRojo and Polunin: a lesson in passion\nFrieze: A Preview of the Madness\nThere is a whole lot of STUFF worth seeing at the Art Fair. Not all of it is Art\nEva Rosenthal\nThe talk of the day at Frieze Art Fair,\nfrom some grasped snippets of con-versation, was a Yacht.

Apparently this sort of thing\nis called \u201cready made art\u201d and \u201cthe\nviewer gets to decide on whether or\nnot to consider it art\u201d. How lucky\nfor \u201cthe viewer\u201d right? It is necessary to have a vast amount of cheek\nin order to get away with it. I was not\nconvinced although, as someone very\nkindly put it, \u201cYeah\u2026. But you get\nthe signature!\u201d.\nIn spite of all the rubbish that makes\nit into Frieze in the sacred name of\nArt, there were many beautiful objects worth looking at. The following\ncomments are simply on a few personal favourites.\nAt the Gagosian stand was a banana suspended by two strings and\nprojected onto the wall to look like a\nwine bottle. This sounds rather silly;\nin person it is captivating. Work by\nCarsten Nicolai at Galleries Pace, Eigen and Lorcan O\u2019Neill, is as elegant\nas it is complex. He brings together\nthe seemingly opposing worlds of art\n\u201cYeah... But you get\nthe signature!\u201d\nand mathematics with mesmerizing\ndesigns. Finally, some striking col-laged books by young Czech artist\nEva Kotatkova, also caught my eye.\nBy seven in the evening, after 6\nsolid hours, there has been a torrent\nof art shoved down your eyes, your\nthroat, your ears, and they can take\nlittle else. You are in an arty stupor\nand wandering through the ether,\ndrinking in only the atmosphere, the\ncharacters, and hopefully the cham-pagne. Because Frieze Art Fair is just\nas much about the people traipsing\nthrough it as it is about Art. There are\nsome wonderfully mad ones, in the\nbest sense of the word.\nFrieze Art Fair, 13 October \u2013 16th\nOctober .
