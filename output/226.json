    "content": "FELIX TV COMES TO GUILDS\nElectrical Department Experiment\nin the Use of Television in Lectures\nSome Lecturers PreferTelevision\nCCTV IS the name plate which has been puzzling many members of the Electrical Department this year. It is the signature of the department's latest experiment into educational methods.' CLOSED CIRCUIT TELEVISION' is\nthe signal used at the start of each of the department's experimental programmes. On most Fridays a cluster of technicians maybe seen outside the lecture theatre on level four, which temporarily becomes Imp rial College's version of the B. B.G's White City Studios. Complete programmes produced Some time ago under the initiative of the\nCommunications Section of the Electrical Department a small scheme was started to evaluate\nthe possible uses of television as a teaching medium within universities. This is part of a larger scheme which is looking into a whole series of teaching aids from the overhead projector to video v recorded programmes. The programmes produced so far are unpolished and suffer from many technical faults, at the\nmoment they have come to a complete stand still because the very simple recorder that is\nbeing used ha$ had to go away for repair. Most of the faults which are noticeable at this s ft age are the results of the in ad eau ate equipment that\nmust necessarily be used for this small pilot experiment. The worst one being the breakup of the picture whenever cameras are changed,\ndue to lack of proper synchronising equipment.\nVisiting Lecturer's reactions So far these programm rn si are being confined\nto the humanities part of the second year course\nas this does not interfere with the degree\ncourses. Already it seems that some visiting\nlecturers would prefer to give 'their lecture by recorded television as this enables them to use\na greater variety of models and illustrations\nthan would be possible in the conventional\nlecture. Experiments conducted in the USA also seem to show that in some cases a student\nis capable of sustaining more serious attention\nand of achieving greater re tent iv it y with tele-vised Ipc'ij ref i, possibly because he' feels that\nhe does not share' the lecturer with so many\npeople. It is capable of being a more personal\nmedium than many others.\nElectronic Enlarger The production of complete recorded programmes is not the only aspect of television\nthat is under investigation. For 'the past year or\nmore an increasing use of television has been\nmade within the live lecture, for enlarging de-mon st rations. Small models can be shown to\nlarge audiences, and demons'.i ii-ions set up in a laboratory can be shown to an audience in a lecture theatre. This has obvious uses in other\ndepartments where, for example, a whole class\ncan be shown the same microscopic sample.\nOther Universities Imperial College is leading the field in some\nspheres of the study and use of television as an\neducational medium, although other colleges\nhave had all the publicity. Strathclyde in Glasgow and Leeds are both reported to be running extensive schemes but they are a iso interested in the part that universities can play in public education and broadcasting, Imperial College being mainly concerned with studies of the use\nof television within the college department. The scheme at Sussex is a very much smaller affair\nwith only one camera and no recorder.\nCooperation with R.C.A. One of the things that fa growing out of this\nincreasing interest within the Electrical Department in the use of television and films is the\nco-operation between that department and our\nneighbours in the Royal College of Art. One of\nthe staff of tire RCA, Mr. Trevor Scott, has been\nseconded to Guilds in order to help with the\nproduction of the television programmes and a variety of films that are being made in the college. By using some of the facilities i that they\nhave in their film and television unit it is bec o ming possible for better productions be\nmade than would be possible with the Elect ri cal Department's own small resources.\nOur thanks are due to Professor Cherry for\nanswering our questions.\nJ. Cawson\nStart Made on\nWork Parties for\nNetting Hill Housing Trust\nNOTT TNG HILL HOUSING TRUST WORKING VISITS This term has seen the beginning of visits to\nthe Netting Hill area for the purpose of decorating property bought by the Trust. Each Saturday morning, a dozen or so volunteers\nhelp with the work, which comprises painting, plastering, wallpaper hanging etc. The people\nconcerned choose the number of hours they\nwant to work, and a valiant few often spent\nfrom9.30 a.m. to 5.30 p.m. on the job. The Trust provide all the materials needed and free\nlunch is provided by Father Diss of the\nAnglican Chaplaincy. The guiding influence behind the working visits is a new College society, the O.S.S. \u2014\nOrganisation of Social Services \u2014 run by Arthur Francis. As well as the help given to the\nNH HT, the O.S.S. have also started social work in other fields. During the Week, members go\nto read to the blind. There have also been\nvo lute ers to work as supervisors at a children's\" adventure\" playground, and to work with young people in a coffee bar/ youth club in the\nsame area.\nThe Photo by Colin Harr-s\">n shows a party of students from\nImperial College at work in one of the houses which is being\nrenovated by the trust\n\n"

Any reference to people with more\nthan Mr. Live sey1 s meagre knowledge of these topics, will confirm that these comments\nare in the first ple.ce wildly wide of the mark, and in the second, downright untrue.\nWith regard to the second paragraph, the executive was concerned and interested enough in the subject of loans to accord a lOC Pb turn-out at the Union meeting to listen to the views of the Union Members. The only trouble was that not enough of the latter were interested enough to turn up also.( Certainly this was not due to lack of publicity) I am not particularly c once n ned with the fate of Mr. Livesey's motion as it is purely parochial and whichever way the vote goes, I do not believe any world shattering changes will result, I was extra*.jy disappointed.however that the loans topic, which\nco-old possibly vitally effect many first and second year undergraduates, also received the \"couldn't care less\" typo arp roach.

    "content": "12 FELIX Felix interviews \"University Challenge\" men\nB AMBER GASCOIGNE Photos by Colin Harrison\nb v Hugh Jones and Tony Firs h man Bamber Gascoigne, \"anchor man\" of\nUniversity Challenge, talked to FELIX in\nthe New Theatre public house, Manchester\nas he relaxed after the evening's recording.\nBamber, wearing a brown suit and blue\nshirt, de rig our for such a personality,\nordered ap:\"t of bitter and settled back,\nsaying \"Right, what can I tell you\".\nHe said he became\" Anchorman\" of University Challenge after auditioning together with other journalists and actors \u2014 the company desiring to go outside the established circle of\nquiz masters to further the image of ' the programme as a more serious form of entertain-ment. In the earlier years, he used to set the\nmajority of the questions, but nowdays he only sets the oc as ional one, liking to pose the\nmore frivolous question to lighten the proceed-in gs. Asked whether his comments on wrong answers were original or provided for him, he replied that he was provided with the barest\nminimum solution to each problem but spent\nan afternoon reading round the questions in an encyclopaedia.\nHe is thus ,able to anticipate many wrong answers and to provide just a little more information than is required. This fortunately gives\nan impression of great omniscience.\nSetting ques a ions he said, is a very difficult\ntask. The compiling of the questions bears no relation to the nature of the teams competing, is being almost impossible to set \"scientific\nquestions\" \u2014 these, of necessity are either of ' O' level standard, or if they are to test even a( second-year undergraduate, require too detail-eda knowledge of the subject to be answered b v other than a specialist However, the majority of people are likely to know about \" literature on France\". B amber describes his job as \" leading the life\nof an academic, with none of the teaching resp on sibi li ties\" and says that he receives six fan letters a week. He spends most of his time in either the British or Victoria& Albert museum!\"*\nresearching for the books he is presently\nwriting on the history of the theatre.\nIt was his interest in the i\" theatre which enabled him to become established in journalism. After graduation,( he read English at Magdalene, Cambridge), he spent a year on a Commonwealth scholarship in the United States studying the modern theatre, and while there he was ask d by Hutchinson s to write a book on this\nsubject This necessitated av ear's research back at Cambridge, which he said he very much en joyed. It was here that he decided to enter\njournalism as a critic, and began writing reviews\nfor the Cambridge Review. He said it was, then a matter of hawking his reviews round the national\npress, eventually being taken up by the\nSpectator.\nLeaving the Spectator, he became theatre\ncritic for the Observer( until 18 months ago\nwhen Kenneth Ty nan rejoined the paper). It was at this period that he was approached to\naudition for his present post and he is now concentrating on University Challenge. He suggested the television companies tend to turn to\nacting and journalism( sister profession) for\ntheir new talent. Another very good way of\ngaining an entree to television is to join aTV company straight from university as a research-er, with a view to promotion to director or\nproducer, to the ranks of which they occasion-ally turn to provide new fr on it men.\nQuestioned about the element of deception\nin television \u2014 For example saying \"see you again next week\" to one of the teams, and in fact saying\" hallo\" again in thirty minutes \u2014 , ha Suggested that their was no more fraud in this\nthan smiling at aTV camera, when in fact one\nwas appearing in black and white in the homes\nof millions of people.\nThis contrast, he said, was unsettling to the\nnovice but eventually it becomes possible to consciously charm a camera \u2014 although the presence\nof a studio audience in a show such as University Challenge was a great help \u2014 even more so\nup to six months ago when the audience in a show sat immediately behind the cameras,\n( B amber now sits at one side, the control box\nimmediately in front of him). At this point, after over an hour of\n(energetic) conversation, Bs r\"'ie r Gascoigne suggested he should perhaps speak to some of the\nother teams,\nPETER MUL. LING S by Colin\nPeter Mullings, TV director and producer,\nis an active man. His puckish face and\neves reveal h's humour; his pen-and-pencil\nlined pocket be tra vs him as a writer and not\nthe actor he once hoped to be.\nHe is at present director of University Challenge, amongst other things,, but his start Was\nin the theatre. In194?> he spent six months des troy ing his illusion that he could be a great\nactor and in1946 became a stage manager. He continued in this line until the mid fifties when he io in ed Granada as an acting floor manager \u2014\nwhich involves responsibility for the scenery,\nprops, etc. for each set. The next step was promotion to floor manager whose job it is to\nrepresent the director on the studio floor: to\nyell silently at studio staff or lead the audience\nin mock applause ( why not use a record?).\nIt was not until1962 that he became a director, having done a certain amount of producing already. A producer is concerned with organising and coordinating the production of a programme. He is responsible for the expenditure for the programme and, except in drama and\" jimi lar material, he selects the participants.\nA director deals mainly with the script; in documentaries he must occasionally rewrite some of it and have it approved by the author.\nDuring a performance he will be seated in the\ncontrol and may, if the fancy takes him, gesticulate at the studio staff or merely wave his arms wildly in the manner of one caught in quicksand. Mr Mulling s recieved no formal training as,\na director, the method of initiation used by Granada was swimming pool tv pe^ in at the deep end. So much so that his first week gave\nhim control of eight shows. At first he worked quite a lot on adl vert ising magazines, but in recent times he has concentrated on \" University Harrison\nChallenge\" documentaries and educational programmes. However, pro garm mes. are not his sole\nconcern; at present he is engaged in the production of a booklet for the summer schools\nprogramme. This kind of work he prefers to\ndo at home as there is less risk of interruption.\nThe pressure of his work is variable: some\ndays he may not go to the studios at all, on\nother occasions he has had to work until dawn preparing material for that day.\nHis relaxation is photography, although he feels that his work depends considerably on his\nphotographic ability. It has ty jena lifelong hobby; he developed his first film at the age of\nten and still has a monster lens with which he did much of his early work \u2014 until the tragic\ndaywhen his camera could bear the weight no\nmore. He views the coming of colour television\nwith mixed feelings, \" Rather like seeing your mother Jo law driving your brand new Rolls over Beachy Head\". Too often, he says, directors\nhaving no sense of form or balance produce monstrosities in black and white; with colour\ntheir scope would be widened. After his early training in advertising\nmagazines he is critical of contemporary advertising directors. One will come up with an idea and although he cannot explain its meaning, he may have the ability to convince the\nsponsor it is the right way, whilst the man who can think and explain his ideas is often in cap able of communicating them effectively w television. As a result he detests advertising.\nThe average life of a director is five years.\nWhat will Peter Mulling s do for the remaining twenty years or so until retiring ? He recognises that he cannot continue as a director;\nhowever, he hopes to use the experience he has\ngained in altering and am mending scripts to\nwrite original scripts and thus remain in the\nbusiness; \"there's not much else I can do\".\n\n"

C.G0 DOWN \u2014 to 10 men!\nU.C.2 \u2014I.C. OI.C. started this match against\nthe Cup holders in excellent\nstyle, combining well and moving the ball quickly and accurately from man to man... the forward line continually broke\nthrough the Kings defence and\nHopwood was unlucky to see his\nheader go just wide from a Crawford free kick. Such was\nthe pressure exerted by I.C., due\nmainly to the wing forwards\nsnapping up chances, that it took\nKing's ten minutes to launch their\nfirst attack.\nKing's were lucky to survive this\nearly period, but once they had settled down their football matched that of I.C.'s. The play was a de light to watch with both teams fight-ing hard for the ball and using it intelligently. I.C. still had the edge\nthanks to the defence maintaining a tight hold on the opposition forwards and still managing to d is tri bute the ball to the forwards Good King's form\nHowever, towards the end of the first half King's at last showed their\ncup winning form, and were gradual ly overcoming the college defence by the speed with which they interchanged position and switched the\nball from wing to wing. Woj t owicz was twice forced to dive at the feet\nof oncoming forwards after the de fence had been split. A good King's move took the ball from their left\nwing to the right and back again, catching the whole defence by sur-p rise, and he inside right nodded home the f hit goal.\nI.C. fought hard to erase this\ngoal and several times forced the King's defence into a muddle. An intelligent move on the right wing ended with Hunt firing a low. hardball across the goal but the keeper\nwas able to grab it before the I.C. forward could reach it. Only a minute before halftime the King's goalie had to leave the field with a sprained ankle won cutting out a high cross.\nCollege fight back\nThe second half began with the\nball moving from end to end; but the nI.C. began to recover their\nearlier form and were unlucky not to force the equalise r. Bentham and Wide l ski were particularly prominent but the King's defence held tight and must be congratulated for the way they withstood I.C.'s attacks\nwith only ten men. Final goal\nAs in the first half King's fought\nback into the game and were again forcing the college defence into mistakes.

As at the last round we came\naway unsure as to exactly how me had fared. The league is split into\nfour divisions and we have teams in div s.I and III. Every team takes\npart in every match and movement up or down depends, not upon total\npoints gained, but on wether you i beat one particular team or not \u2014 it was never clear exactly who it was our tun to try and beat. However with J.C. contributing most competitors we should have done quite well,\nInevitably we came first and second in the high jump with Leon Hall clearing an admirable6'0 for the conditions,. Chris Power and Paul Jones won first and second\nplaces in the triple and long jumps\nrespectively and with other third and fourth places the results, when we get them, should be reasonably\ninspiring.\nOn the track we were not nearly so successful.

Bulgaria is a. small country in the Balkan Peninsula whose fertile\nplains and fields look like colourful carets and who J2'.( ww capt ped peaks and sun drenched beaches are washed by the warm, blue waves of the Black Sea. A beautiful country impregnated with the aroma of rose gardens, blessed\nwith an abundance of grapes and other fruits and vegetables, of\ntobacco, herbs and flowers. The mild Mediterranean climate low humidity, beautiful blue skies and rain less summers make the country a natural\nholiday' paradise.\nHospitality is traditional with Bulgarian people and is considered\nan outstanding feature which man if ect s itself in everyday life. Many villages still preserve the custom of\nspecial days of the year when all\ndoors are open to visitors and it is\nconsidered a special honour to welcome those of other villages or more distant parts. Young girls receive\nthe guests with joyful Spngs, and their hosts invite them to the most\nprominent places at the table.\nIt is impossible to describe all the\nr teh variety of Bulgarian drinks and food, but here are some hints to\nbear in mind.

    "content": "20\nFELIX FELIX WEEKEND\nCHEMISTRY EXAM CRISIS\nOVER ?\n\" Mod\" Battle\nat Hop\nUntil last Saturday, although the \" Mod\" representation at the Hop had\nbeen stead il v increasing th rou eh out the year, there had never been any\nserious trouble. The fellows had been mere'v content to dance among\nthemselves\u2014practising the latest steps\u2014or to i'\" a* their girl-friends. Un fortunately, they now seem determined\u2014; bly because of their\nincreased numbers\u2014to disrupt the dances.\nTHE PART ONE Final Examinations for second-year Chemistry\nundergraduates have been returned\nto- their original dates. This was the\nresult of discussions between IC President Adrian Fletcher and the\nHead of the Chemistry Department,\nProfessor R.M. Barrer, last Wednesday.\nHowever at the time of going to\npress it seems even more likely that\nthe national rail strike projected for Valentine's Day will take place. To fu ard against this ten rooms have\neen made available in Halls of Ttesidence for those entrants who live a considerable distance from the\nCollege. As a further safeguard the suggestion made by Mike Scott, RCS Pre sid ent, that the exams should be deferred until the afternoons in question has\nbeen implemented. Scaffolding\nto go ?\nA20% INCREASE in parking\nspace bas been ach'eve d in\nthe Southside (residents') car\nPark by the efforts of the Car\nar king Committee.\nTen places have been gained by\nthe removal of five vehicles wh ica did not belong to current Southside\nresidents and were not registered\nwith the College, and another five\nwhich were registered but were in a state ot disrepair are either oe i ug le paired or nave been removed. One veni cie having neither insurance nor taxa lion has been moved to i ht Imperial Institute Road, wh''e trie owner considers his position, where, not being registered with the College, it is committing a trespass\n(as it was in the Southside park) and will hi.ve to be moved. The scaffolding presently in front\nof S^u tii side would diss apear under a Scheme put loi ward by the Co minute e to introduce diagonal parking places to the road in front of South side. Tiu j scheme would give a net increase in the number of places\navailable, while giving due allow ance for( improved) access, and would remove the ugly scaffolding.\nPlaces would be reserved for the\not ii er( non-college) users of the roadway( Air Squadron etc.) and for motor cycles and delivery vehicles.\nIt should be noted that the road way in front of Southside is a general I.C. parking place, but that\nthe car park and ramp on the East side site is for Hall residents cf So ub side only.\nThe committee have also suggested that a gate be installed at the\nrear entrance to the Southside park,\nI.) prevent access to the park from\nthat un lit direction at night \u2014 this to\nhelp prevent some of the frequent\nthefts. The gate * vo ul d cost \u00a3 4 0 to install, and as the park will oe\nclosed on the commencement of\nEast side is unlikely to materialise.\nJ.G. BALCONY ESCAPES\nFAIL TO OPERATE\n\"I am very worried about the\npresent situation\";\u2014so said the\nDomestic Bursar on Friday after the\nfire practices in ac como dati on buildings on Thursday.\nThe practices, following letters to the Secretary of the College and the,\nDomestic Bursar after the in ad ver tant ringing pf the fire alarm bells i in Southside and pointing out that no practices had been held in that\nbuilding for two years revealed defects in the Southside alarm systems.\nSeveral of the alarm bells failed to sound and the automatic' locks on the balcony escapes failed to oper te \u2014see letter on inside pages.\nMr. Anthony, fire officer, commented that he wasi in the hands of the maintain en ce departments, but that\nmore regular checks would be introduced, including monthly fire\npractices. Domestic Bursar Mr. Seaford who had unlocked the malfunctioning door using a key, commented\" I'm worried; I live at the top of the building\" and said that\nhe had instructed that if there was any doubt as to the reliability of the doors, they were to remain unlocked. Southside has been the source of\nmuch controversy over its fire precautions) \u2014the LCC would not allow the building to be used without the ciA i struct ion of the balcony stair-ways and also i nsted that the alarm bells be replaced as they were not loud enough; since then the charges\nfor the bells have been replaced as\nf ii ot were not powerful enough, and gates have been erected at the feet of the balcony stairways \u2014 Mr. Anthony commented\" a move in which security and fire safety conflicted.\" On Saturday at about10.00 p.m., a group ot approximately two dozen congregated near the stage an a then in single file barged their way through the dancing couples towards\nthe main door. Here they regrouped and charged torn- abreast towards, the\nstage, cornering someone whom they\nimmediately knocked to the floor.\nGirls ran away screaming and couples fled in all directions. Several\npeople then rushed downstairs to bring reinforcements from the bar, but the fighting had subsided before\nthey arrived on the scene.\nThis type of behaviour cannot be tolerated; it has i never happened before during my three years in college. The number of male outsiders\nat our dances will soon be in the\nmajority, and, together with their\nthirteen to sixteen year old girl friends, they will completely mono polis e the dances. Surely nobody at\nI.C. wants their presence, because\nthey tend to attract very young girls\nand offend tire type of women we would like to see. The dances are)\nrun primarily for in e Penent ot our Q. VU s cu u ern ij sot natt ney \u2014 ' being in a pr<ie uc au yall male nist it u tio a \u2014\u2022\u2022\ncan meet women ot the same age\nanu outlook i rom oUr er colleges.\nWe must therefore restrict en trance to students only, otherwise\nwe will become the local\" Mod\" meeting place.

    "content": "6 FELIX DO YOU KNOW\nWHY UNILEVER RESEARCH\nis a First-class\nCAREER CHOICE?\nTHE MAIN FUNCTION of\nUnilever Research Division is to\nhelp Unilever keep its position in the\ncommercial and industrial world \u2014\nby intensive research into the fundamental scientific aspects of products\nit sells or wishes to sell; and by the\ndevelopment of new or improved\nprocesses Or products.\nIn other words, the scientist in\nResearch Division is essential to the\nfuture prosperity of Unilever. And that is why you are given all the op-port unities, facilities and rewards\nyou need to make a first-class career.\nBasic or Applied Research ?\nUnilever believes in giving the individual\nscientist full scope for development of his\ntalents. You may be concerned with product\ndevelopment work, or with research into the\nscience underlying the properties, manufacture\nor mechanism of action of our products, or you\nmay be involved in a fundamental study of\nsome branch of science which will be of long-term value to Unilever but has no immediate\napplication in products.\nIn developing new products you will not be\nmerely mixing ingredients. You will be\ninvestigating the logical outcome of the basic\nresearch carried out in your own or other\nUnilever laboratories. Of equal importance to\nthe development of new products is the\nassessment of their efficacy in use. This means\nthe design of objective scientific tests to\nmeasure.the properties which are judged in a subjective manner by the consumer. In\nproduct development work independent and\noriginal thought on a high scientific level is as\nessential as in the pure or fundamental research\nwhich goes on in the same laboratories. The\nsatisfaction lies in seeing products on the\nmarket and patents secured rather than in\npublished papers which are expected from our\nbasic research.\nHow do you keep in. touch ?\nAs a scientist in Unilever you will have\naccess to a wide range of specialised techniques,\nX ray diffraction, I.R.,U. V., N.M.R., E.S. R., Raman spectroscopy, mass spectrometry,\nelectron microscopes and electronic computers.\nYou learn what is going on in the other\nUnilever laboratories, both in the U.K. and ,\nabroad, by the circulation of reports, by conferences and by personal contact. Close\ncontact is maintained with the universities\nthrough university staff who act as consultants,\nand by Unilever scientists who work in\nuniversities. You are encouraged to maintain\nyour own academic contacts and to make new\nones, as well as taking part in the affairs of\nlearned societies.\nWhat vacancies are there ?\nUnilever Research has four locations in the\nU.K. \u2014at Port Sunlight, on Merseyside; at\nWelwyn, Hertfordshire; at Colworth House,\nnear Bedford, (with an out-station at Aberdeen); and at Isleworth, Middlesex. These are part of\na world-wide organisation with laboratories\nalso on the Continent, in the U.S.A., and in\nIndia.\nIn order to staff these laboratories Unilever\nResearch always needs: chemists\u2014physical,\norganic and some inorganic; biochemists;\nanalytical chemists; physicists; microbiologists; chemical engineers; mechanical engineers; biochemical engineers; and information\nscientists.\nThere is also a smaller periodic requirement\nfor graduates trained in veterinary medicine,\nincluding animal pathology and physiology;\nmathematics, especially statistics; systems\nanalysis; operational research; radio-chemistry; and in biology with specialised\npost-graduate training in subjects such as\npharmacology and histology.\nFor entry to the Scientist Grade we want\npeople with a Ph.D., or good primary degree,\nor equivalent. They must be scientifically\ncreative and should have initiative, technical\nskill, and the capacity to relate their science to\nour industrial situation.\nThe Research Assistant Grade is for graduates who want to make a career in the more\nexperimental aspects of the work, and here\nthere is a greater emphasis on technical skill.\nWhat will you earn ?\nSalaries will reflect your ability, but you can\nuse this general framework as a guide:\nScientists\u2014the usual starting salary for a newly qualified Ph.D. is \u00a31,300, rising to\n\"1,500 after about one year's service. The new\nri mary graduate, recruited into the Scientist\nJrade, receives \u00a31,000 and is awarded fixed\nincrements for two years so that his salary\nreaches \u00a31,300 on establishment. These rates\nare increased by up to \u00a3100 for every year of\nresearch experience relevant to Unilever's interests. In addition, an extra 5% of salary,\nwith a maximum of \u00a3150, is paid to scientists\nin the Isleworth and Welwyn Laboratories\nsince these are in the London Area.\nResearch Assistants\u2014graduates in this\ngrade earn a minimum starting salary of \u00a3850.\nRelevant experience is recognised in starting\nsalaries and the 5 % London allowance for the\nWelwyn and Isleworth Laboratories is also\npaid.\nFour weeks' annual holiday leave is given\nto established scientists, and three weeks to\nScientists before establishment and to Research Assistants.\nAll graduate research staff become members\nof the Unilever Superannuation Scheme.\nCan you get ahead fast ?\nYou will find plenty of opportunities; it\ndepends solely on your ability. Unilever\nResearch is quick to recognise merit, and\nthere's no question of 'standing in line' for\npromotion, which can be on scientific ability\nalone.\nIs there further training ?\nYes. All scientists attend a week's residential\ncourse on business principles within about two\nyears of joining the Company. Other training,\nincluding management training, is later given\nas circumstances and prospects demand.\nScientists With three or more years' service are\neligible to compete for Unilever Internal\nResearch Fellowships, which enable you to\nreturn to university for one or two years to\nundertake research of your own choosing. You\nmay also be sent on temporary second ment s to\nother Unilever Divisions or to universities,\neither in the U.K. or overseas.\nDo you want to know more ?\nWe shall be glad to advise you at any stage of\nyour scientific career, and especially to discuss\nthe possibility of future employment with those\ngraduates who are going abroad for post-doctorate fellowships. An appointment with a representative of Research Division when he\nvisits the Physics Department on 10th March\nand Chemistry Department on nth March,\ncan be made through your own Department.\nA booklet giving more detailed information\non research in Unilever is obtainable from your\nPhysics or Chemistry Department, or from the\nStaff Officer, Research Division, Unilever\nHouse, Blackfriars, London, E.C.4, telephone\nFLEet Street 7474.\nUNILEVER RESEARCH UK IQj-j MO "

Scorer, Professor of Theoretical Mechanics at this college, talked to the Huxley Society on the\ntheme of ' Planning or Improv is at ion?\" The audience was less than he deserved, but as usual we found that this only made the discussion\nuf ter wards more rewarding. He talked of many things : on the need to\nlive life by a series of provisional hypotheses to avoid rigid plan um';, about the care we must take in our\nattempts to help the developing world without disrupting their traditional life. The fact of being happier in later\nlife as a Professor than as a Junior Lecturer. It was interesting that the\nlast war seemed to have been one\nof the most influential events in the\nProfessor's life, suggesting perhaps\nthat a mandarin life of calm achievement does not teach one all one needs to know.

    "content": "4 FELIX FELIX5 Comment by the\nEditor\nPathway to Presidency NORMALLY, about this time of year it is\nbecoming obvious who are the main contenders for the \"top post\" in Imperial College Union, But there seems to be at\npresent no outstanding pfa-son a 'Jiti^s running\ntor the Presidency.\nApathy has spread thus high in the Union. Needham, following in Fletcher's footsteps as\nROS representative on Council, was early last term expected to continue upon that\n-course. Such ideas he has since sought to dispel. Since he hopes to conduct postgraduate\nresearch at Sil wood, he would require a sab-bat ical year if he were to accept the post.\nThis change in the constitution is. not expected\nto occur. However, it does seem . possible \u2014 in spite of last fortnight's in quo rate IC Union Meeting \u2014 that next year's President maybe elected by a full Union Meeting rather than by just Joint Council. Are there any other possible contenders. A few favour the chances of the two Keith s \u2014 Guy and Cavanagh. Other outsiders might include.D a i Hp well, President of Guilds, who at pre sent expects to be working next October, but who seems to betaking an ever more important role in Executive. But it is more usual for the President-elect to rise from the lower ranks cf Council. It is\ngenerally agreed that the canvassing for support that ha!j to take place when there is\nmore than one candidate demands as much time as the work involved in being any officer of the Union. Fletcher is attributed with eighteen month's canvassing prior to his\nelection.\nHowever,, next year's President need not, even under the present rules, arise from this year's Council. It is merely somewhat to his advantage to be familiar with the way in which Council works. Perhaps more important, though, is the candidate's ability to present, if not now, then certainly by October, an imposing and responsible public image; for this is what the Union, and the general public, sees as\nthe epitome pi the student population of Imperial College, Experimental Education pELI X has in the past carried several\narticles critical of the teaching methods used\nin the college and it is. therefore, pleasing to print an article about research into educational method which is going on in one of the Departments. On our centre pages you: will find a description\nof the experimental v vor k which is in progress\non the use of television within the college.\nBut television has been in operation for many years now and a lot of experience has been gained both in this country and in America on its use as an educational medium. Is it not about time that Imperial Colle ee Another\nFilibuster?\nSIR, The President of the Union showed little concern that the Union meeting of J annar v27 th. was inou orate. in f ii cf. he proposed that it be turned into a meeting of the Debating Society. It would appear that he feels his sole responsibility, asi far as Union meetings are concerned, is to call them. No new meeting has been\narranged before March3 rd., this is no doubt an attempt to prevent the lobby of the House of Commons from taki ng place. A working party\nwas set up by the last' Union meeting and yet the Executive does not seem concerned to\ndebate the findings. Can the Executive really claim* ole interested in the views of the mem her s of the Union? I hold that were members\nof the Union to elect their\nPresident then there would be more respect paid to Union meetings. After the last Union meeting. Mr. Fletcher retired to conduct what appeared to be a private witch hunt against \" Col cut t\";no doubt he felt he had the support of the\nUnion in doing this!\nDAVID LIVES EK Point of\nInformation\nSIR,1 would like to point out a slight and unimportant error\nin the report on\" Quiz International\" on page12 of is sue 2 2 5 .\nThe matches you refer to\nwere recorded, not broadcast\non12 th and18 th Jan.. respect-iv ely.

Many pie sent expressed admiration torI he\nwork that must have gone into lettering so many thousands of copies,\nand drawing the skilful pictures.

As a first-year Engine ring student\nI( among many others) have had several times i to wait a fortnight or more until\" the order comes in\" when trying\nto obtain the recommended textbooks. Iam informed that the Bookstall has held copies of these \u2014 small stocks\nwhich were conn i med in the first week of term. When the majority of students buy their textbooks here, is it not\nreasonable for the Books tall to buy large stocks of the recommended editions?\nIs Folk Club\npower-mad ?\nSIR, Yesterday evening (26 Jan.)\nI was fortunate enough to> be.\nin the audience of the FolkSong Club's Concert in the Upper Refectory. For this\nprivilege, as> a member, I paid four shillings \u2014 no small sum for a Col'e ge function of this type \u2014 and with a ticket\nfor a girlfriend who accompanied me that evening cost\ne ie't shillings.\nWe arrived at 8 nm. the concert ha v in<* offic'al lv commenced at 7 30, to find a wall of bf ek s of the large n ro portion of the audience who were standing facing us in the entrance. Un dismayed we forced our way into the room, 'there was no ticket check and the ever-increasing number of\npeople Who pushed into these et ning mass of humanity did not and were not asked to\npay.\nf hus we stood for an hour, unable to move in an atmosphere rapidly decreasing in oxygen content and unable to appreciate the first-class\nentertainment provided.

The publishers are loath\nto print large editions because\nauthors of scientific books\nwrite frequent new editions.\nThus, if we order too few at the beginning of the Session,\nit maybe difficult to obtain\nat the Books tall before term starts has always been a difficult one to solve for the fall owing reasons ; \u2014\n1.

From bitter experience\nthe Manageress knows that,\n5. There is a large second-hand text-book market at I.C, the size and effect of which it is impossible to judge.\n6. Some bookshops offer an illegal discount on text-books,\nthe effect of which is to draw off an important and unknown portion of College trade.\nI agree it is not a very satisfactory situation; we do our best under difficult c irc um stances. Iam sorry it is not always good enough.\nThose Gates Fail\nSIR, Last Thursday Selkirk and Keo gh Halls had a fire practice,\nand the infamous fire escape gates on the Prince's Gardens balcony failed to open. We. all the residents of staircase 6 ,\nKeo gh Hall are absolutely disgusted by the policy of the College's senior officials concerning these gates.\nOn this occasion we were fortunate in that only sufficient\ntime elapsed for two or three people to be trampled to death\nin the melee around the gates, and perhaps a dozen burnt on the crowded balcony, before the Domestic Bursar saved the day with his formidable bunch of keys. How comforting to know that this gentleman is on hand day and night to save us from such peril! How soundly we shall sleep at night, knowing that our saviour only has to descend 1 4 2 steep h' winding, possibly un lit steps before reaching the vital gates!\nFar better to stand the chance of losing one's property than the possibility of a needless and tragic death. We, the under signed, demand that these gates should be open day and night\n\u2014 fire is no respect or of people's convenience.

You can find her up the spiral staircase\nby the Southside Supermarket. Now, armed with a copy of the regulations\n(yes, there are some regulations despite what anyone says) and8251/6/2,000/1165/... S, you are\nin a position to apply. Page one is fairly\nstraight-forward, be ag largely factual history\nrequirements the scope for extensive lying is\nrather limited. A choice of hall fc asked for, and it is wise to specify, especially if one hall\nfavours your particular interests. IC Union men, Felix, Dram soc and Co. are generally found in Beit; Rugby players are everywhere but mainly inTi zard. There is not much really\nbetween the hal h>, although Garden is fairly old and has some double and triple rooms for people\nwho like that sort of thing. Your real scope for ingenuity comes on Page\ntwo where you will find four general questions\nabout your school, interests, positions! and your\nexpectation of hall existence. Number one asks\nwhat you have done since yo1 left school. Only two column inches, they don't expect much. If you did a year in industry, says so. if not, still\nsay so, they won't check up and it sounds\ngood. A trip round the world is a good one, but read some travel books in case the sub-warden\ninvites you to dinner. Avoid at all costs such\nthings as \" did voluntary work in Africa\" or\n\" worked in a youth group in Spain\", such\n\" goodie\" activities rarely go down well. Moving on to Question2, you will find an other two inches and an extra eighth asking for your college record. A degree of accuracy is essential here; saying you're \"President of\nR.C.S.\" maybe true but not patri cula rly useful.\nMembership of a leading sporting club is\ngood, especially the Rugby Club, Soccer Club or Boat Club. Put them down even if your only\ncontact was on Freshers Day. Avoid\" Igo to hops every week\"\" I went to Morphy Dav.\"\"I stood for eight hours in the rain waiting for the Queen Mother\",\" I went to Commemoration Day\",\" Igo to lectures\" like the plague,\nalthough \" Igo to hops every week without\npaying\" may help in some halls. A long list of\nridiculous clubs (no names mentioned) merely\nshow, a weak will on Freshers Day and will wreck your chances. Any sign that you've done\nsome hard work at college is useful, .try \" I mended a desk in our lecture theatre\" although\n\" I'm up to date on sheets (problem variety)\" ma v raise a laugh but you will still be commuting next year.\nCont. in next issue\nsuch as printing, photography, etc. The meeting then passed to the motion. Proposing it, Mr Ben Barker said he hoped no-one would accuse the Board of acting merely\nto defend itself; there were many other good reasons he could name, but which he preferred to keep\nanonymous. What the Board wanted was constructive criticism, which could only be provided by the best\ninformed people. Perhaps satirical\ncolumns should be written by the people being s at iris ed. Miss Virgii.l 'ii Lust worthy( Sil wood Field Research) complained of the crudely written sex air.l violence she found in every Coi cut t. She hoped it would improve. She approved of sex, but in the light places. A FELIX writer's column v v sis not one of them. Mr Mike Mill stone. Halls representative, said ho disapproved strongly of this Coal hole fellow's ri'f< \u2022 c nees to\" ove might ii ue it ni an ship'. He had never heard any one else make such disgusting innuendoes against the Halls, apart\nfrom a certain Mr Irving; he would not be surprised to find they were\nout* and the same person.\nN 'sr Phil d in said he thought\nFELIX had quite enough amusing material without resorting to such people's efforts. There were an a grams . scrambled sentences and' i ue ssw hat-this-is pictures, on every\npage. The so-called Careers Supplement had been a most amusing parody which could give offence to\n1\n1\n0 one.\nIl was a pity more space could not\nbe found for pictures of pretty girls,\nwh i.h never did a paper any han.i. he thought. Many suggestions were\nmad>' in the next few minutes, for tin- inclusion of a pets page, old folks corner, Garth, investment\nguide, etc. Mr Paul Krom eski e. Refectories Libel Consultant, said di at he c fall people should knowhow difficult it was to write something\nthat briefly represented the true\nsituation in all its complexity. The refectory menus had sometimes been\naccused of shortcomings in this res-pec t. There distortion was never\nwilful however, but in Ignotus he had sometimes detected veiled references of an unkind nature.\nOpposing the motion, Ian Bilious,\nthe Editor, said he deeply resented'\nthis attempt on the freedom of the\nPress. The whole issue was deeply\nbound up with the idea of democracy and he could therefore see no alternative to a Blistering Editorial( uproar). Subsequently he would be quite ready to comply with the Board's requirements, however, Mr Lecher described this decision as\n\" state man like\", and the motion was\npassed by a large majority, after\nseveral attempts.\nOwing to pressure of time a motion that Mr Bowell s be appointed Taste and Decorum Adviser to FELIX wi di wide powers of de tension and arrest was postponed.\nZamee !\nVERY MUCH in decline since\nthe emergence of Wellssoc is\nthe Comics rip and Science Fiction Appreciation Society (SciFiSoc).\nIts one time chairman B.B.

Mitchell\nTHE APPLIED HEAT SECTION of the Mechanical Engineering Dept is to introduce a metric system of units\ninto their courses next session.\n(The Applied Heat Section\ncovers Thermodynamics, Fluid\nMechanics!, Combustion and Heat\nTransfer).\nAt a recent meeting the Staff\nwere unanimous in their decision to\nincorporate the new units into their\nlectures, but as yet he plan is to use\nthem alongside the present system,\nrather than substitute them for it, and try to make students ' bilingual'. Professor Spalding, Head of the Applied Heat Section, hopes to have things such as Heat Tables avail able in the new system of units by the start of the next session.\nThe decision to use metric units\nis in line with general Government policy on this issue. In May last\nyear Mr. Douglas Jay, President of\nthe Board of Trade, issued nool icy statement in which he s^ id that\nBritain is to switch to a metric system\nof units. He said that the Change\nover would probably take about - 0\nyears, but he hoped that industry will have cn an ged within ten years.\nThe Government took this step\nafter representatives from various industries had presented the case in.\nfavour of the change to it. One major\nadvantage of a metric system is that\nit will make export dealing!* simpler.\nA Government committee consisting\nof representatives from the relevant\nGovernment departments and Industry, was set up to keep the\nprogress in the change-over under\nconstant review and the British\nStandards Institution was charged with the working out of metric\nBritish standards.\nA spokesman for the Ministry of\nTechnology said they are exhorting the whole of British Industry to adopt the new metric system, and added,\" The change will be effected\nas rapidly as can conventionally be done. We are aware however, of\nthe large number of small pr act icca K difficulties. ;\nUn bf fic iai|/, it is\nexpected that the Imperial system\nof units will be made illegal within the for ese able future, but it is\ndou bj ful whe tn<T ii h^old system will die out for a considerable time.\nThe particular metric system that\nis to be introduced into the Applied Heat courses, and in fact into the country in general, is the 'Internation-al System'. (SI). This is a coherent\nsystem with six basic units; metre,\nkilogram me, second, ampere, de Cont. on back page, col. 4.\nGIANT FELIX\nHUGE SUCCESS\nFOUR RECORDS\nTO SHOUT ABOUT1.

At the Felix Board meeting be fore the last issue went to press1, a motion was passed which would have limited the number of anonymous columnist ls to one.\nWhen the issue came out it had the usual two columns by Ignotus\nand Col cut tin defiance of the edict.\nPresident Fletcher, who wrote in Felix last year as the columnist Col cut t, called a meeting of the Board and it was believed that the\nmeeting would call for the resignation of the editor and his staff.\nIn the small hours of the morning that the Board was due to meet, a compromise was worked out under which the two offending columns\nwould disappear and the Board would ignore the way in which the editor had disobeyed their commands. This was agreed to at the formal meeting.\n\n"

Carruthtrs M.A. used to illustrate his lecture on\" How to provide good social ser vic es\". An extra mural lecturer for London University, educated at Glasgow and L.S.E., he researches\nfor the Acton Society Trust, and his lecture on Tuesday1 st Feb. was the\nfourth in a series concerning modern economics.\nJ.P. Carr uther s argued that the\npolitics of this, century had been and would continue to be dominated by the need to expand the economy of\nthe country, in order to provide adequate social services. Economists, he said, always disagreed about the\npriorities of social services, but were unanimous in regarding them as essential to the survival of modern industrial society. He told of the difficulties he sometimes has in explaining to more militant shop\nstewards that social services can only be improved by increasing industrial\noutput. Extra revenue gained by taxing the \" rich\" was quite negligible against the enormous sums of\nmoney required to\" expand the social services.\nUsing the latest Government White Paper on Economic Development to illustrate his lecture, he showed that if this country improves\nits economy by25% by1970, than\na further \u00a3 1 5 0 0 million will be ear-marked for improving social services.\nIn exp lining the merits of improving the social services, viz. education, health, housing, and National Insurance, and the improvements in the\neconomy thus gained he decried the\npresent attitude of politicians to\neducation, which, he said, seemed to\nbe the poor man out. More and more schools were becoming in ad equate in the face of rising pop ul at ion. Far too few graduates were taking up teaching as a career, and yet the education of a nation's people was the most crucial factor\nm maintaining a healthy economy.\nFtr too h'it le time was left at the\nend of t'e lecture for questions, but, nevertheless, a vigorous discussion\nensued between the more I'v ely minded of Mr. Carr<it her s'lu dien te.

Teaching by men and women who are\namong the ablest of their generation... graduates\nwho are among the most outstanding of their\nyear. Teachers have greater influence on future\ngenerations than any other profession.\nWhat does Teaching offer you in return ?\nNew opportunities\nTeaching is a vigorous and growing profession. It offers\nthe graduate greater opportunities than ever before,\nboth in developing professional skills and in achieving\nposts of influence and responsibility \u2014 often far earlier\nthan in many other careers. For example, nearly half of\nthe men graduate teachers between 25:and 29 hold such\nposts and receive salaries well above the basic scale.\nAbout half of those in their 30's arc heads of depart-ment s, earning up to \u00a32,330, or hold even higher posts.\nOne fifth of those now in their 40's are headmasters who\nmay earn salaries up to \u00a33,850. The prospects are even\nbetter for graduates with first or second class honours, or\na higher degree.\nNew ideas - new initiative\nThe mastery of teaching skills and the evolution of new\nmethods are a stimulating challenge. New discoveries\nand new knowledge present teachers with problems for\nwhich there are no precedents. New communication\ntechniques and aids must be developed.\nTraining: an extension of your knowledge\nSome graduates feel uncertain whether they are\ntemperamentally suited to teaching. The one-year\npost-graduate training course equips you to start your\ncareer confidently on a basis of practical experience\nas well as theory.\nWhy not find out more?\nTalk things over with your Appointments Board, and ask for the new booklet, 'Careers in Education for\nGraduates', or write for a copy to Room114(22E/r) Department of Education and Science, Curzon Street,\nLondon, W.1.It describes the schools of today and the\nkind of teachers they need; their salaries and special\nallowances.\nHe needs trained minds like yours\nto fit him for tomorrow's world\nl uut jb} Ihl DlparUmnl of Education and Stitm\n\n"

The line out s were general-ly even but frequently ended in indecisive mauls or with the award of a penalty.\nAmongst the I.C. backs C happel was always dangerous, Ballard made the most of the few chance she was\ngiven and Riley on the other wing though tightly marked succeeded in slipping the leash during the dying minutes.

The absence of Davies now appeared to behaving a telling effect and while all I.C. movements\nwere swamped in the covering defence L.S.E. looked increasingly\ndangerous. Another L.S.E. penalty\nshot hit the upright, stretching I.C. Supporters' nerves to breaking point (judging by the squeals of\nMiss Pocock!) but somehow the\nstorm was weakened and in fading light and drizzle a draw began to\nseem inevitable.\nfinal fling\nThen, with four minutes left, a line out on the far side saw the ball whipped out to Riley who, for once\nfinding room to move, beat three\nmen before being forced into touch. From the resulting line out came a maul and from the maul burst Ray, flattening two would be tacklers be fore feeding the ball to Riley, who found Cass on at his elbow to take\nthe pass and go over for a try hotly\ndisputed by L.S.E.

    "content": "FELIX9 WHICH WAY IMPERIAL?\nAdrian Fletcher Looks Around\nIN THE PAST, criticism, has\nbeen levelled at the Unions/ especially the constituent ones, for concentrating too exclusively on Morphy Days and beer drinking. Most of this criticism has been ras the run founded and wide of the mark, but nevertheless it has usually\ncontained a grain of truth. I remain unashamedly in favour\nof 'sport' functions, because I think they fulfil a vital role in getting\npeople together enjoying themselves\nand giving us a much needed corporate identity, but obviously they\nmust be seen as one part of an existence and not the be all and end all of life. To attain its full potential,\nthe Student Union must always be considering new ideas and question-ing its present practices, the former\nbeing just as important as the latter.\nPerhaps the fact that most of the comments and ideas reaching the Union Office here tend to be destructive is one reason behind the somewhat conservative outlook of\nthe Unions in the past. It is undoubtedly true that being one's own pace-setter is not so satisfactory\nas having a third party in the background With a loaded shotgun. I suppose that the connection between my billing and the above is not immediately obvious, but as the rest\nof this article is concerned with new ideas, particularly in the constituent\nunion/ academic field, it is wise to\nstate our \"terms of reference\" first.\nAcademic\nmatters\nI.C. is a big college, 3335\nstudents big to be precise, and it is\ncorrespondingly difficult to general is e when academic matters are concern ed. Let's start by stating that the\nobvious people on the student side\nto deal with academic matters, are\nthe constituent unions. Given this,\nwhat's the score to date?\nC and G have the most developed formal relationship of the three colleges with a staff/student academic sub-committee meeting roughly bi annually. This covered all the de partments, and several of the ideas\nemerging from it have found the'r way into courses. Of crucial import ance in the success of this venture\nhas been the goodwill and trust\nexisting between Guilds Union and the Senior Staff. Mines rely almost\nentirely on informal contacts, which they find very effective, although they now have a student officer\nspecifically to deal with academic matters. R.C.S. departments vary \u2014\nPhysics committee was disbanded because they found nothing tod is cuss in view, of good informal con tack ts, while an academic committee\nset up recently in Chemistry seems,\nfor various reasons, to have got\nnowhere.\nIt is interesting to interject here\nthat the Manchester Conference thought that official representation\nin all but very small departments\nwas essential, and that informal discussions stemmed from this.\nAbout the future, the most important' thing is that the constituent\nAD RI AN FLETCHER looks at three of the many problems facing our Unions and their members in the light of (some of) his experiences\nas\" President, and the ideas out forward at the recent Manchester conference on European Technological Education. unions and a good number of de partments realise the existence of the\nabove problems, and are prepared to work towards their solution.\nProblems will vary from the general \u2014 ES STE recommended more emphasis on the design and costing\nin courses, the wide-s rv read issuing\nof prepared notes before lectures),\nand more frequent examinations\nwith emphasis on the 'open book' type \u2014 to be specific\u2014the provision of\na tea machine for peon le studying Smith sidecar parking! It is imp or tant to realise that no one approach is the best for all cases, and that or ie must not try to superimpose a system that has worked with AonB, whose problems are different.\nWhat is significant, is the fact that\nmore than eve i before, constituent\ncollege unions are concerned with these problems. What is essential, is\nthe realisation that nothing can really be done without mutual trust\nand good wii l between staff and students.\nonuS on us as v officers is to provide information on all these opportunities \u2014 hence the appearance for the first time this year of a year-book, union directory, and the very\nsuccessful single \"what'son\" column in this paper. We are also\ntrying to make more effective use\nof the notice boards, but without doubt the most important feature\nin this field is Felix itself. That is\nwhy1 find it rather tragic when some people, especially some sports\nclubs where there is a potential of\nbuilding up 'college spirit', seem in capable of letting the paper know wha t^oes on.\nBecause of differences in the setups it is impossible to lea many thing direct from Europe in this\ncase. By and large they do. however,\nchum out <\n) information than\nus, but muc.4 of it relates to\nacademic courses which are already\ncovered here by the college publications. One German handbook goes\nso far as to comment at length on the merits and de-merits of engineer-ing courses in Germany and Austria!\nOne must also, of course, talk in\nterms of ideas as well as concrete\nfixtures. What I said earlier about\nnew ideas filtering through, applies\nmore to the constituent Unions but is also true of I.C. Union. A Oita k down in communication has occurred if even one Union member feels\nthat he cannot chat to one of the,\nUnion officers about an idea and get a sympathetic hearing.\nEducation\nwhere and\nfor what?\n. I noticed recently that \" Education for what?\" is the title of a Huxley society meeting in the near future.\nThis question, and the equally imp or cant one of why people come here in the first place, is a sphere in which the Union has hitherto\nplayed no part whatever. True the\nformer problem is handled very efficiently by college appointments\norganisation, supplemented in two cases by the old student's associa t ions,. What about the latter?\nEuropean Union publications often\nprovide the only information students\nreceive about their alternative places\nof study. Some other English University Unions operate systems\nwhich enable potential undergraduates to see the Union and chat to\npresent students before they decide\nwhether or not to accept a place.\nStrathclyde goes so far as to send\nstudent speakers out to local\nschools to give information and answer questions. In fact, because\nthe two previous problems, I have\nconsidered tacitly assumed that a student has chosen the right course\nof study for him or her, this may well be the most important question\nof all. Well, if you think so, let's hear about it.\nOnus on\nstudent\nThe second problem, touched on briefly earlier, is one of communication between the Union and its\nmembers. One has to decide basically whether the Union should go to the member or die member to\nthe Union. Imperial College Union has, again by reason of its i size,\nchosen the latter course.\u2014je. we provide facilities, services, and opportunities for club etc. activities,\nwhich any student can use, the onus\nbeing on him or her to do so.

The first le-cord of brewing in the town dates\nback to 1295 when King Wenceslas\ngranted to the Burghers of Pilzen the\nright to- brew beer.\nThe Burghers, of whom there\nwere270, were families who owned property in Pil zen. Over the\nyears they found it more convenient to have a common brewery and a Master Bi jj wer was mac(3\nresponsible for providing the hops\nand malt. After each brewing a committee of Burghers would taste\nthe beer to test its quality; if it fell below the committee's requirements\nthe whole batch was thrown away. In1840 Pil zen laid the first\nfoundations of a proper brewery; by1844 it was producing its first beer\n. A. bout this time there was tre men dous argument on the method of\nbi'ar wing \u2014whether it should be bottom or top fermentation. Put to\nthe vote it was agreed that bottom fermentation should be the method for Pil s ne rUr quell \u2014 which has continued to the present day.\nThe beer cons iS its of three ingredients \u2014 water, malt and hops.\nThe water is a very important commodity owing to its particular proportions of zinc, iron and other\ndem ents. In the first stage the malt is\nboiled in water for several hours in \"kettles\"\u2014-huge steel vats lined with wood. The solution is then\npiped to fermentation vats wh i cn are also of wood. The famous Zatee\nhops \u2014 one of Czechoslovakia's main exports and used extensively even\nin this country by many breweries are added together with some yeast.\nIt is Common practice With some breweries to add sugar to speed\nthis process (top fermentation) but no sugar is added to Pilsner beer,\nso fermentation takes eight weeks. \"Jht turning of the froth on top of\nthe vats to a brown f rh white colour indicates that the beer\nis ready to be piped to large wooden funnels below the brewery, where it is matured for six months. This brings o \u00bb<t the f\"U flavour of the\nhop? \u00bb*>d malt for which Pilsner\nUr quell bear is famed.\n\n"
