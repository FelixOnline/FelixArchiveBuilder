And it\u2019s a performance that deserves every bit of the highest praise.\nIt\u2019s remarkable to see what the young\nactress is capable of conveying such\na wide range of emotions only with a\nflicker of her eyes. It\u2019s her compelling\nportrayal that makes its three-hour\nlong running time seem like nothing.\nSandra Bullock (Gravity)\nAlfonso Cuaron\u2019s box office smash-hit\nis also something of a favourite with\nthe critics too, and with 5-star reviews\npopping up, the technical accomplishments here will certainly be in for a\nreal chance at the Oscars. But will\nSandra Bullock manage to win over\nthe voters with her performance? She\u2019s\nan inexperienced first-timer in space\nstuck in the worst possible situation\nbut she finds the courage and survival\ninstinct within her to persevere. The\nincredibly loud and dramatic ending\nworks thanks to some narrative buildup coming from her part.\nAmy Adams (American Hustle)\nAlready an astonishing four-time\nnominee (this should be five: she was\nrobbed for Enchanted, ROBBED),\nperhaps this could be Amy Adams\u2019\nlucky year. This is the first time she\nwill be contending in the best leading\nactress category, one that is traditionally tougher to crack than the supporting actress award. She is once again\nteamed up here with director David\nO. Russell (The Fighter), and given the\nsignificant buzz surrounding her film,\nthe daring, sizzling display she puts on\nshould certainly help when it comes to\ncompiling the nominees\u2019 shortlist.\nJulie Delpy (Before Midnight)\nIt seems Julie Delpy\u2019s talents aren\u2019t\nlimited to co-writing a fantastic script\nthat rings true to life. As one half of\na couple who we\u2019ve started adoring all\nthe way back in 1995, she and Ethan\nHawke make such an entertaining but\nalso a brilliantly convincing pair who\nonly need to have conversations to\nkeep the audience occupied and interested in their lives. They have immense likability, and she helps bring\nabout the Before series to become\none of modern cinema\u2019s best, most\nendearing love stories that makes the\naudience want more.\nB\u00e9r\u00e9nice Bejo (The Past)\nAnother French addition to the potential nominations, and the foreign language aspect will make it impossibly\ndifficult to make it to the shortlist, but\nmaybe her Best Actress win at Cannes\nmay boost her chances. The Artist\nmay have put her name on the map,\nbut here she is in a far more intriguing\nrole. At the heart of a complex family drama that has shocking secrets\nto reveal at every turn, Berenice Bejo\nis simply magnetic - a flawed wife, a\nflawed mother, and a flawed lover. Her\nrestraint, mixed with infrequent outbursts are unforgettable.\nGreta Gerwig (Frances Ha)\nDubbed the it girl of mumblecore\ncinema, a recent new subgenre of\nAmerican independent filmmaking,\nGreta Gerwig\u2019s quirky, off-beat comic performance is a highlight of this\nlow budget rom-com. The film itself\ncomes across as a touch too episodic\nand sporadic in nature, with no attention paid to telling something coher-ent, but holding everything together\nis the titular Frances (Gerwig), a New\nYorker nearing the dreaded age of\nthirty in search of a secure job, a stable\nplace to live, and love, with sadly none\nof them coming easily to her.\nNaomi Watts (Diana)\nOliver Hirschbiegel\u2019s Princess Diana\nbiopic flopped in the UK and is having\nan even worse time over in the States,\nwith an appalling 8% rating over at\nrottentomatoes. Given Naomi Watts\u2019\nprevious nominations, her impressive\ncareer, and a film of so much poten-tial, everyone was easily predicting an\nOscar win for Watts at the beginning\nof this year. That is until the film was\nreleased without any film festival attention or big campaign push from the\nstudio. Watts does give an admirable\nperformance, but there\u2019s only a slim\nchance at awards glory.\nRooney Mara (Side Effects)\nIt was released a while ago, which\nnever works in a film\u2019s favour when\nthe end-of-year release schedule is so\ndensely packed with the traditional\nOscar-bait movies, but Rooney Mara,\nthe American Girl with the Dragon\nTattoo, gives yet another compelling\nperformance as a duplicitous back-stabbingbitchwhotriesallsortsofma-nipulation techniques to get what she\nwants. She\u2019s no doubt a new emerging\ntalent, and a nomination this year will\nbe unlikely, but further down in what\nshould be a glittering career, she will\neventually score something.\nTilda Swinton (Only Lovers Left Alive)\nAs a pale, eccentric vampire, Tilda\nSwinton eerily looks the part and no\none could have given a more fascinating interpretation of a centuries old\nbeing who always looks immensely\ncool and wise as she ponders in deep\ndiscussions with her husband, another\nvampire played by Tom Hiddleston.\nIt\u2019s a slow-burning drama for sure,\nquite the noticeable departure from\nfilms dealing with the supernatural,\nwhich is what makes Jim Jarmusch\u2019s\nnew drama so unique in its storytell-ing. Swinton never falters, whatever\nbold film choices she makes.\nKate Winslet (Labour Day)\nAs a divorced single mother falling\nfor a dangerous looking escaped convict who may have murdered his own\nfamily, Kate Winslet plays her role just\nright. Her desperate longing for some\nreal human contact is what starts off\nthis affair that\u2019s certainly odd and unnatural to begin with, but as this relationship grows throughout the period\nof a single weekend, it soon turns into\na beautiful love story in a warm backdrop worth rooting for which is what\nmakes the final few scenes all that\nmore precious, with Winslet capturing an enormous range of emotions.\n\n"

    "content": "11\n@feliximperial\nFelixImperial\nFRIDAY 15 NOV\nCOMMENT\nT\nhis time last year I bought\na bike. It had taken four\nyears of living in the city\nbut I was \ufb01nally living my\nstereotyped London dream\nof \ufb02ying around on two wheels,\n\ufb02uorescent jacket \ufb02uorescing and\ncarbon emissions zeroing; king of the\nroad. The bike was freedom. Unlike\nthe tube, I could get exactly where I\nwanted to go rather than a ten walk\naway. Unlike the car I could tie the\nthing to the nearest pole and get on\nwith it. It was blue in some parts and\nanother shade of blue in other parts. It\nwas perfect.\nI was initially cautious, sticking to\njourneys through parks and laughing\nwith unbridled joy as I left hapless\npedestrians and the occasional horse\nin my wake. What chance did they\nstand? The bicycle was the vehicle\nof the future and I its shiny jacketed\nprophet. The speed, the elegance, the\ndinging bell. They were glorious days\nbut this was mere child\u2019s play and I\nknew it. It couldn\u2019t be long before\nI left my bipedal and quadropedal\nplaymates for the Big Boy world of the\nLondon road.\nIf you haven\u2019t had the experience\nof being a tiny sack of squishy meat\n\ufb02eeing a stampeding herd of steel\nwildebeest who dislike you for not\nhaving to pay road tax then you\nhaven\u2019t cycled in London. There are\nfew things to make you so acutely\naware of your own mortality as\npassing through Trafalgar Square\nat half past 5 on a weekday. The\nroundabout seems to be governed by\nchaos and bravery, often forcing me\nto circle it a few times before escaping\nto the correct exit. It\u2019s always while\ntrying to change lane that you realise\nyour helmet is essentially an upturned\npolystyrene cup with holes in it, which\ndoesn\u2019t help much either.\nIt\u2019s when the sun starts to set that\nthe real horrors kick in. No matter\nhow many \ufb02ashing LEDs I attach\nto myself (I\u2019m starting to look like a\nhuman-shaped Tetris game), drivers\nwill never behave as if they are aware\nof my existence, barely missing me as\nthey overtake. Potholes, conveniently\nlocated at the side of the road where\nthe cyclists cycle, are rendered near-invisible, leaving my backside near-unsittable. Then if you\u2019re out really\nlate, you have the joys of drunk\ncyclists to look forward to, wibbling\nand wobbling side to side as if the road\nwere one big tightrope.\nIt\u2019s fair to say I had an authentic\nexperience of cycling in London but\nmy baptism wasn\u2019t fully complete until\n6 weeks into bike ownership when I\ngobbled my last piece of authenticity\npie; my bike was stolen. Well, sort-of\nstolen. I kept forgetting to lock the\nthing up and eventually someone took\nup my o\ufb00er of a free bike.\nI was bereft. Yes, the bike was a\nsource of mortal peril but it had\ngiven me a certain freedom I now had\nlost. For the \ufb01rst time I had started\nto understand London as a city, a\ncoherent whole. Travelling by road I\nhad seen how one part related to the\nother. Now, stuck on the underground,\nI was con\ufb01ned to a sub-par existence\nof perfectly straight tube lines and\nother people\u2019s body odour. Here there\nwas less danger of death but it was all\nfalse and arti\ufb01cial, like only playing\nchess with your four year old brother;\nyes, you\u2019ll never lose but you\u2019ll never\nexperience the challenge of a good\ngame, not to mention the fact that\nhis still developing spatial awareness\nmeans you have to move his knights\nfor him.\nMarx would say I was \u201calienated\u201d\nfrom my true nature. All I know is I\nmissed my bike and really wanted to\nget a new one. I got one second hand\nin the RAG bike auction for \u00a330 which\nlasted precisely ten seconds when I\nrealised it was meant for someone a\nfoot shorter than me. In the end it took\nmonths of saving but I \ufb01nally bought a\nshiny cream coloured bike with white\nhandlebars and a white seat. It\u2019s a bike\n\ufb01t for the Angel Gabriel himself and\nis serving me valiantly. We\u2019ve been\ntogether now for 6 months and haven\u2019t\nlooked back, the steaming sweat patch\non my back during morning lectures a\ntestimony to our bond.\nMy year of London cycling has been\nboth o\ufb00-putting and on-turning, a\nmixture of horror and freedom. For\nall its perils, cycling really is the best\nway to get to know the city and feel\npart of it. If you really must walk, my\nlast word is for you; ask not for whom\nthem bell tolls, it tolls for thee. So get\no\ufb00 my damned cycle path.\nWhy you should make way for cyclists\nDon\u2019t be Agnostic About Interfaith\nN\next week is National\nInterfaith Week,\nestablished four years\nago to bring people\nof di\ufb00erent faiths and\nbeliefs together and build bridges and\nmutual appreciation between social\ngroups that may not mix on a regular\nbasis. While it hasn\u2019t been \u2018celebrated\u2019\nor \u2018observed\u2019 at Imperial College\n(depending on one\u2019s Interfaith views) I\nthink that we are foolish to pass up the\nopportunity- especially when our faith\nsocieties are as big as they are.\nLet us clarify \u2018Interfaith\u2019. It is\nanything that gets people of di\ufb00erent\nbeliefs to gather and encourage\ndialogue and understanding. The\nspirit underlying interfaith events is\nnot one of hostility. If your conception\nof interfaith is \u2018putting the other party\ndown\u2019 you\u2019re doing it wrong. That\ndoesn\u2019t mean that you cannot discuss\ncontroversial or engaging topics. You\nneed something to get people into that\nroom in the \ufb01rst place. (As a few of us\nhave learned the hard way last year,\nno-one shows up for slightly vague\ninterfaith \u2018chats\u2019). It doesn\u2019t mean that\nyou are barred from disagreement\n(people of di\ufb00erent beliefs will\ndisagree on minutiae). It entails a\ncommitment to genuine respect for\nanother\u2019s opinion and a willingness to\nconnect with someone whose beliefs\nare di\ufb00erent to yours. These e\ufb00orts\nlead to more similarities, rather\nthan di\ufb00erences, being highlighted;\nmisconceptions are removed.\nA non-religious colleague (met\nthrough interfaith) told me about\nhow meeting a super-feminist woman\n(clad in headscarf) challenged his\npreconceptions about said headscarf.\nWe all harbour preconceptions in one\nform or another. It doesn\u2019t make us\nbad people but inaction certainly does\nnot make us any better.\nInterfaith isn\u2019t a luxury. When\nyou\u2019re living in a nation that is as\n\u2018multicultural\u2019 as Britain and when\nimmersed in the international\ncommunity of Imperial College,\nhaving an understanding of others is\na necessity. Prejudice is borne out of\nignorance and can be remedied by\neducation and exposure to \u2018the other.\u2019\nAs an Ahmadi Muslim, a member\nof a minority revivalist movement\nin Islam, I know that there is no\nbetter case study for \u2018how-not-to-dointerfaith\u2019 than Pakistan, my ethnic\ncountry of origin.\nAhmadi Muslims are declared non-Muslim in the very constitution of the\nnation by amendments made in the\n70\u2019s and 80\u2019s. If I were to \u2018pose\u2019 as a\nMuslim in Pakistan, through word or\ndeed, I could be subject to \ufb01ne, three\nyears in prison even death. Ahmadi\nMuslims are by no means the only\nsect to be victimised in recent years.\nShias, Christians, Hindus, Atheists\nand others have su\ufb00ered from intense\npersecution and discrimination. Year\non year the holy month of \u2018Muharram\u2019\nis vigil to intensi\ufb01ed attacks on the\nShia population. Hundreds are killed\nannually by militant organisations.\nTo make things worse, Draconian\nblasphemy laws sti\ufb02e any semblance\nof free speech and perhaps, even\nmore surprisingly, 75% of Pakistanis\nsupport them (Pew). One wonders\nhow they would have perceived the\nProphet Muhammad when he allowed\na visiting Christian delegation to pray\nin his Mosque.\nThe increasing persecution in\nPakistan encompasses a state-sponsored atmosphere of mistrust, a\nlack of education and an abundance\nof misinformation. It underlines\nthe fact that, where we can do\ninterfaith, we must. It creates an\nenabling environment to explore our\nsimilarities and di\ufb00erences openly\nand remove our misconceptions. It\nteaches us that di\ufb00erences aren\u2019t the\nproblem but that our reactions to\nthem are. The crux of \u2018interfaith\u2019 is\nnot the \u2018faith\u2019 bit but an open mindset\nand a willingness to engage. It is\nsomething that will go far beyond faith\nand serve us well in our future lives.\nThe important kernel of \u2018interfaith\u2019 is\nthe expression of togetherness that it\nbroadcasts It highlights the humanity\ncommon to us all.\nRory Fenton\nColumnist\n@roryfenton\nUmar Nasser\nPresident of Ahmadiyya Muslim\nStudents Association\nCycling in London makes you feel like you\u02bcre riding with Arnold Schwarzenegger\nGUARDIAN\n\n"

    "content": "21\n@feliximperial\nFelixImperial\nFRIDAY 15 NOV\nTELEVISION\nham celebrates the unsung art of the miniseries\ne Attention Deficit\nThe Hollow Crown\nThe BBC\u2019s adaptation of Shakespeare\u2019s\nHenriad tetralogy of Richard II, both\nparts of Henry IV, and Henry V is a\nstar-studded a\ufb00air, featuring what\nseems like every British actor to have\nbeen on TV in the past \ufb01ve years.\nIt\u2019s ambitious in scope - the four episodes follow the reign of three di\ufb00erent kings - but an incredibly engaging\nwork, mainly thanks to the brilliant\nperformances of those involved.\n\u2018What makes a good king?\u2019 is the\nquestion central to the series. The Hollow Crown is a story about power: the\nstruggle to gain it, how to keep it, and\nwhat it means to lose it. Ben Wishaw\nplays a rather weedy Richard II,\nscrabbling to keep hold of the throne\nagainst his challenger Henry Bolingbrooke. With his ostentatious air and\ntendency to play the martyr (the King\nis literally dressed like Jesus in almost\nevery scene), it\u2019s hard at \ufb01rst to \ufb01nd\nsympathy for Richard, but thanks to\nWishaw\u2019s sensitive and complex por-trayal, it\u2019s di\ufb03cult not to feel sorry for\nhim as he is betrayed one by one by\nthose closest to him.\nNext up are the Henrys, with Bolingbrooke now on the throne as Henry\nIV, played by Jeremy Irons. Having\nlearnt his lesson from the predecessor\nhe overthrew, the new king is a pow-erful, authoritative \ufb01gure, showing no\nmercy to those he sees as his enemies.\nHe is troubled most of all, however, by\nhis son: Prince Hal, who is probably\nwhat passed for a \u2018lad\u2019 in Elizabethan\ntimes, and prefers to spend his days\ndrinking and whoring rather than facing up to his princely duties. (The \ufb01rst\npart of Henry IV is worth watching if\nonly to see Hiddleston\u2019s impression of\nJeremy Irons as his on-screen father,\none of the funniest moments of the\nseries.) Encouraged by his friend Falsta\ufb00, Hal shows no appreciation for\nhis role-in-waiting, an endless source\nof worry for his father.\nHenry IV and Henry V can be seen\nas a coming-of-age story for Hal, as\nhe learns what it means to be a good\nKing. It\u2019s a role than Hiddleston,\nalready familiar with playing royalty\nfrom his most famous portrayal of\nLoki in Marvel\u2019s Thor \ufb01lms, is arguably\nborn to play: nailing every emotion as\nhe follows the character\u2019s arc from an\nimmature, sel\ufb01sh youth, through to\nthe death of his father the King, and\nThe Hollow Crown is Shakespeare\nat its best and most accessible: every\naudience can \ufb01nd something to\nappreciate in its timeless themes.\n\ufb01nally as leader and warrior in Henry\nV, where the famous, \u201cOnce more\nunto the Breach, dear friends,\u201d speech\nis delivered with fury and passion.\nBand of Brothers\nForget Saving Private Ryan; if you\nwant a realistic depiction of the horrors of World War II, look no further\nthan Band of Brothers. Another near-perfect war miniseries, the series is\nthe story of Easy Company, a regiment\nof paratroopers in World War II. It\nfollows the company over the whole\ncourse of the war, beginning with\ngruelling training in Georgia and England, through the D-Day invasion at\nNormandy, a freezing winter spent in\nthe forests of Belgium during the Battle of the Bulge, right through to the\nend of the war.\nProduced by Steven Spielberg and\nTom Hanks, the series aimed for as\nmuch as accuracy as possible in its\ndepiction of war: relying heavily on\nthe input of veterans of the war, all of\nthe main characters are or were real\npeople, and each episode begins and\nends with clips from interviews with\nthem (although not until the very last\nepisode do we \ufb01nd out who each person is). Because each character shares\nthe fate of their real-life counterpart,\neach death or injury has added weight,\nblurring the lines between \ufb01ction and\nreality. The penultimate episode, Why\nWe Fight, is probably where the series reaches its emotional peak, in its\nhaunting depiction of a concentration\ncamp.\nA pre-Homeland Damian Lewis\nplays Major Winters, the leader of\nthe company for most of the story,\nwhose determination to get his men\nhome provides the anchor for many\nof the show\u2019s storylines. Most of the\nepisodes are centred around a particular character; with ten episodes in\ntotal, the series gives enough time for\nits audience to feel as if they know the\ncompany, increasing the emotional\nimpact of the story. The huge cast also\nprovides a seemingly endless supply\nof familiar faces: Tom Hardy, Michael\nFassbender and James McAvoy can all\nbe spotted in minor roles.\nIt was, at the time, the most expensive\nminiseries ever produced (exceeded\nonly by its less successful follow-up,\nThe Paci\ufb01c), and was \ufb01lmed mostly in\nEngland. The high production values\ncan be witnessed in the scene where\nsoldiers parachute out of aeroplanes\nonto the beaches at Normandy (heart-stoppingly tense, and one of the best\nscenes of the whole series).\nBand of Brothers treads a \ufb01ne line,\nnever teetering over the edge into he-ro-worship of the men it depicts (he-roic no doubt that some of them are),\nand balancing respect and realism\nwith admirable restraint. Setting the\nbar for World War II television, Band\nof Brothers isn\u2019t easy viewing, but important nonetheless.\nBBC\nHBO\n\n"

Candy is the latest in\na long list of lesbian bars and clubs\nwho have lost their homes in recent\nyears including G Spot, Glass bar\nand Chocolate Lounge. This leaves a\nsigni\ufb01cant gap in the market, as it is\ncurrently the only remaining female\nonly space in Soho (men may enter,\nbut not unaccompanied). This is a fact\nthat I \ufb01nd shocking and saddening\nin such a diverse and cosmopolitan\ncity as London. Candy\u2019s motto is\n\u2018Run by Girls, For Girls\u2019, which really\nemphasises the importance of a\nspace in which women can feel safe,\nand are protected from the negative\nattention which sadly follows same sex\nencounters in many environments.\nIncreased costs for leasing property\nin London have forced the owners of\nmany venues to sell up and instead\norganise events for gay and bisexual\nwomen without a \ufb01xed location. Even\nthe most popular of these events,\nsuch as Twat Boutique, no longer\nhave a regular visible presence in the\nLondon club scene. This prevents the\nformation of a community around a\ncertain place, and makes it far more\ndi\ufb03cult to go out, as it is less possible\nto be spontaneous.\nAs a gay or bisexual woman, you\nare in the minority, which makes it\nfar harder to meet people (or say,\nto pull people) than it would be for\nheterosexual women, purely for ease of\nidenti\ufb01cation and the numbers game.\nThis is why I think it\u2019s so important\nthat somewhere like Candy exists; I\nthink that it is crucial that members\nof the LBGT community have access\nto the same opportunities as someone\nwho is heterosexual.\nWhat is even more disappointing is\nthat Candy was one of the few gay bars\nthat had wheelchair access, at least\non the ground \ufb02oor. As a wheelchair\nuser, I am very used to having to make\nenquiries as to whether or not a venue\nI haven\u2019t visited before has step free\nWhere has London\u2019s lesbian scene gone?\naccess.\nIn response to the closure of Candy,\nthe KuBar plans to radically overhaul\nits premises to make the entire lower\nground \ufb02oor into \u201cKuBar Girls\u201d, which\nwhile decreasing the size of the women\nonly space, aims to remain in keeping\nwith the original ethos of Candy:\nbeing run by girls, for girls. The new\nbar will have only female bouncers,\nand a separate entrance to the ground\nlevel KuBar. However, the space is\nbeing created through the renovation\nof the existing premises, which do not\ncurrently provide wheelchair access to\nthe lower level.\nI, as well as several others, have\nwritten to KuBar asking them for\nreassurance that they will be putting\na lift in as part of the refurbishment.\nI have not yet received a response!

I honestly never\nthought that marking papers could\nbe worse than sitting them. I was\ncertain that this would be the subject\nof my confession today. However,\non Monday I was highly irritated,\nwhich I know is fairly easy for me, but\nnevertheless this kind of behaviour\nshould be stamped out immediately\nas it was certainly not like this in my\nday...\nI teach a class to a pretty cool crew\nof freshers on Mondays. During the\nlast \ufb01ve minutes of a tough tutorial, I\nwent over to a guy with his hand up.\nHe was stuck on part of the problem,\nnothing out of the ordinary. I started\nto explain his mistake. Immediately\nGTAs are helpful only when asked nicely\nhe said, \u201cI don\u2019t understand\u201d. As I had\nbarely said anything yet, this seemed\nunquestionable. So I asked him what\nhe did not understand, only to get,\n\u201ceverything\u201d as the response. To start\nwith, this is irritating. As a GTA, I am\nnot contracted to re-explain the entire\ncourse up to now to him, particularly\nin the last \ufb01ve minutes of a tutorial,\nbut perhaps he is feeling hopeless. We\nhave all felt that way at some point at\nImperial, after all. Trying to be patient,\nI ask him if he understood last week\u2019s\nproblems, and he said he had done\nthem all as they were \u201cridiculously\neasy\u201d. His words not mine.` I pointed\nout that his mistake was in part of the\nproblem that was covered the previous\nweek. This was his reply:\n\u2018You are obviously talking rubbish\nbecause I have got this question right.\nThe lecturer knows as little as you on\nthis topic. I did this all at school and\nit was much easier with this method\nI have done here. I don\u2019t know why I\nbothered coming.\u2019\nMy immediate response was that I\ndidn\u2019t know why he bothered asking\nme! If you are so sure of your answer\nwhat is the point in a second opinion?\nI mean seriously, what is a GTA\u2019s\nmotive to lie? We are de\ufb01nitely not\npaid enough. I also wanted to point\nout I was top ten in my year, thank\nyou very much, and passed this course\npretty damn well (I\u2019m doing a PhD in\nit), but then I felt stupid for wanting to\njustify myself to an 18 year old. What\nI couldn\u2019t say was \u201cGood luck with\nthat method then, fresher. If you enjoy\nfailing carry on.\u201d\nOn relating this to a fellow GTA,\nshe told me another quite startling\nstory. One of her students decided\nto email her to say that he didn\u2019t do\nthe homework and didn\u2019t turn up to\nthe (compulsory attendance) tutorial,\nbecause he de\ufb01nitely didn\u2019t receive the\nemail she sent him telling him when it\nwas. Noting kindly in the e-mail that\nin future could she please ensure that\nhe gets them? Looking down the email\nmy friend saw he had sent this lovely\nnote by replying to the email she had\nsent him in the \ufb01rst place. Nice.\nSo the subject of this week\u2019s\nconfession?\nGTA\u2019s do not care if you fail or not.\nNo point arguing with us or lying\nto us. All we are there to do is help.\nMaybe you can help yourself and just\nask us nicely.\nThe GTA\nAnonymous\n\n"

    "content": "18 FRIDAY 15 NOV\nMUSIC\nEditor: Simon Hunter,\nRiaz Agahi, Stuart\nMasson, William\nStocker\nmusic.felix@gmail.com\naradise Lost played their\n25th anniversary show at\nthe roundhouse on Sunday, and I was there! It\u2019s\nbeen 25 years since Paradise Lost emerged from Halifax in\nwest Yorkshire. Twenty-\ufb01ve years in\nwhich the band has established itself\nas one of the best and most reliable in\nmetal music, with 13 studio albums\nto their name, all but one original\nmember still touring and new material that can stand shoulder to shoulder with the best of their early work.\nGuns n\u2019 Roses should be jealous.\nListening through the extensive back\ncatalog it\u2019s clear the band are never\nresting on their laurels either. The\n\ufb01rst record \u2018Lost Paradise\u2019 sits well\nwithin the death/doom genre, which\nParadise Lost, alongside Anathema\nand My Dying Bride helped to de\ufb01ne\nin the early 90\u2019s when all three bands\nRiaz Agahi\nMusic Editor\nParadise Regained\nThomas Heaven catches Paradise Lost\u02bcs 25th\nanniversary show\nP\nChris Forsyth is an American psych\nrock guitarist much admired by myself\nfor his dabblings in drone and general guitar badass-ery. In my review\nof his previous full length, Kenzo Deluxe, I noted that Forsyth was essentially returning the guitar to some past\nglory, shedding it of the threadbare\nstereotype engendered by cock-rock\u2019s\n(along with many other genres) self-indulgence and reverting it to an instrument of experimentation, where\nmany of the older guitar based genres,\nespecially blues, rear their head at one\ntime or another.\nA year later I discovered Solar Motel, which was released on October\n29th\n. One of the notable factors is that\nit abandons the stripped down atmosphere of its predecessor and instead\nincludes a full band. It certainly moves\nin a more rock fuelled trajectory, as\nthough Forsyth was tracing the evolution of the guitar. That\u2019s not to say that\nthe music has evolved into something\ncheap and unre\ufb01ned. The album bears\nmore resemblance to his earlier work\nsuch as Paranoid Cat and in fact it\u2019s\nrecorded by the Paranoid Cat Band,\nalthough they\u2019ve since been rebranded\nas The Solar Motel Band. It was this\nline-up, featuring Peter Kerlin on bass,\nMike Pride on drums and Shawn Hanson on organs and keyboard, who accompanied Forsyth in his electrifying\nperformance supporting Grouper two\nAMS album of the week\nFoxing released an EP last year called\nOld Songs. I did not care for it. It was\neverything post-rock-tinged emo\nshouldn\u2019t be. The three songs were\noverthought and overstretched, but\nworst of all, they were really dull. It\nwas an emo band trying to be a post-rock band with little success. Since then\nthey\u2019ve appeared on a few splits that I\u2019ve\ncompletely ignored and I didn\u2019t really\nplan on giving them any more of my time. However, I saw The Albatross\ngetting a lot of positive comments and decided to give them another chance.\nI\u2019m really glad I did. It\u2019s ruddy bloody good.\nThe longest song here is still under 5 minutes, and the long tedious\nbuild ups are all but gone. This isn\u2019t post-rock tracks with emo thrown in,\nwhich they\u2019ve proved doesn\u2019t work. This is emo with post-rock thrown in,\nand it definitely does work. It\u2019s still more post-rocky than The World is a\nBeautiful Place and I am No Longer Afraid to Die, but it\u2019s not too much.\nThe instrumentation in \u2018Inuit\u2019 could be taken straight from the loud part of\nan Explosions in the Sky track, but the addition of strained vocals makes it\nstill feel exciting. The crescendo towards the end of \u2018The Medic\u2019 is beautiful,\nwhilst both parts of \u2018Bit by a Dead Bee\u2019 are superb, one pretty and other\nhaunting. Lyrically, it\u2019s absolutely spot on, with \u2018The Medic\u2019 in particular\nbeing absolutely heartbreaking.\nThere are a few duds here. Opener \u2018Bloodhound\u2019 is pretty dreary, whilst\nthe final track, \u2018Quietus\u2019, is probably one that won\u2019t make it into most of my\nlistens to this album. The production could definitely be a hell of a lot better,\nespecially the drums, although this seems like a fairly petty complaint\nabout a record of this magnitude. Limited to just 500 LPs by their American\nlabel, with no British label pressing any, this isn\u2019t even a big release by emo\nstandards. Hopefully this one will receive the attention it deserves so they\nare given a bigger budget next time around.\nThis record is obviously not going to set the world alight. It\u2019s aimed at a\nsmall niche, and outside of that it probably won\u2019t receive any attention at\nall. It\u2019s a shame though, because it\u2019s really great. I would highly recommend\nthis to fans of either emo or post-rock, so give it a go, maybe you\u2019re part of\nthe niche and you don\u2019t even know it\u2026\nFoxing \u2013 The Albatross\nStuart Masson\nin improvisation and one foot in performing a predetermined piece, which\nallows a spirit of spontaneity without\nthe jams getting too unfocused although the album closer \u2018Part IV\u2019 is\ntotally improvised and doesn\u2019t su\ufb00er\nmuch from it, although for my money\nit\u2019s the weakest track on the album, but\nhaving said that it\u2019s the most drone-y,\neschewing the drums in favour of a\nmore amorphous format.\nTo truly appreciate Chris Forsyth\u2019s\nmusic, careful listening is required, as\nit\u2019s all about the subtle build up, with\nincremental evolutions in the guitar\npart with each motif, although it\u2019s hard\nnot to argue that the organ and/or keyboard plays just as much of a role here,\nfor example opener \u2018Part I\u2019 sees them\ntrading leads in its sumptuous buildup.\n\u2018Part I\u2019 is de\ufb01nitely my highlight, particularly a rather rousing guitar part\naround the 4 minute mark. From the\noutset, \u2018Part II\u2019 gives out a slight krauty\nvibe, reminding me of his work with\nKoen Holtkamp not to mention suggesting some of Forsyths in\ufb02uences\nsuch as Popul Vuh. \u2018Part III\u2019 similarly\nposesses quality, in the form of a familiar \u2018Paranoid Cat\u2019-esque build-up that\nuses the drums sparingly and culminates in some classic Forsyth tremolo.\nThe album as a whole possesses the\nusual experimentation and there is\nmuch to hear for existing fans, but the\nSolar Motel has a lot more that will\nplease the casual listener than previous releases so fans and non-fans alike\nshould really check it out because,\nas usual with Forsyth, it\u2019s not to be\nmissed.\nyears ago, which is a great sign for me\nas this was what \ufb01rst introduced me to\nForsyth\u2019s music.\nAside from the more full sound it ac-complishes, it\u2019s hard to claim that the\nalbum is too much of a departure from\nprevious releases. Forsyth\u2019s guitar\nwork, the way he intones the notes and\nthe general style of his \ufb01lls is familiar\nas ever. The album is pretty much what\none would expect from Forsyth, four\nslabs of slow burning brilliance, which\nbalances intricacy of detail in his playing with jamming out and making\nsome catchy tunes.\nForsyth has a style of writing not\nmuch di\ufb00erent from television show\nCurb Your Enthusiasm, in writing an\noutline for his tracks, one which the\nband, by design deliberately treats with\nlittle reverence. This improvisational\nmode is pretty clear throughout, with\nthe repetitive drum patterns driving\nthe music along forming a base which\nthe other instruments evolve over and\nsignalling the major changes, and this\nform of production allows one foot\nChris Forsyth \u2013 Solar Motel Review\nwere signed to the peaceville label.\nThe solid chugging rhythm guitar of\nAaron Aedy with Gregory Macintosh\u2019s\nlead guitar soaring above and Nick\nHolmes harsh vocals gradually evolves\nover subsequent releases. Macintosh\u2019s\nsingle string leads become increasingly orchestrated, slayer like dive bombs\nreplaced with more tasteful calculated\nmelodies. Simultaneously Holmes\neases o\ufb00 partially due to the need to\nconserve his voice and female vocals\nare introduced in places. By the \ufb01fth\nalbum Draconian Times in 1995 the\nband have become one of the primary\nprogenitors of gothic metal. In fact the\nband make it all the way into Depeche\nMode synthpop territory with 7th release Host before rebounding back into\nthe realms gothic/doom metal by the\ntime of Tragic Idols release in 2012.\nThis being the bands 25th anniversary\ntour the full breadth of their work is\nrepresented. Katatoniaopentheshow\nby playing their brilliant Viva Emptiness album in full, legends in their\nown right Katatonia\u2019s early releases are\nhighly reminiscent of the death/doom\nperiod of Paradise Lost\u2019s history. Next\nup gothic metal band Lacuna Coil\nspeak more to their recent albums.\nParadise Lost themselves manage\nto represent twelve out thirteen albums in their set, opening with the\nawesome \u2018Mortals Watch the Day\u2019\ncomplete with Holmes death growls\nbefore, somehow, transitioning seam-lessly into \u2018So Much Is Lost\u2019 from\n1999\u2019s Host. Proving that whilst the\ngenre may have changed the quality\nhas always been there. They put on a\ngreat show, any sense of pretension\nor gloom you might expect from a\ngothic/doom band is completely nulli\ufb01ed by Nick Holmes sarcastic attitude\non stage. The Roundhouse treats the\naudience to a lights show projecting\ncover art up behind the band and the\ncrowd are appreciative responding\nwell to classics like \u2018Enchantment\u2019\nand \u2018Gothic\u2019. There is even a small pit\nwhich is impressive given the slow\ntempo of most of the tracks. The only\ndownside: perhaps predictably for a\nband with such an extensive discography I catch myself noting the songs\nthey don\u2019t play. No \u2018Embers Fire\u2019 no\n\u2018Eternal\u2019, what if they\u2019d played \u2018Crying\nfor Eternity\u2019? \u2018Daylight Torn\u2019? The \ufb01rst\n\ufb01ve albums back to back to be honest\nwould have been \ufb01ne by me. There\u2019s\nno pleasing some people, it was a great\nshow and if you don\u2019t listen to Paradise\nLost already you should really start. In\nfact if you are new to the cannon this\nmay well have been the best set list\nfor you, capturing a bit of everything.\nI suppose I\u2019ll just have to keep waiting for the eleven hour gig where they\nplay everything to be announced . . .\n\n"

Despite its sometimes tragic, sometimes apparently mundane\nsubject matter, the writing maintains a beautiful lightness,\na way of gilding reality with light as Clarissa Dalloway is\nforever doing to the occurrences of her everyday activities.\nThe book follows a day in the lives of several people. They\nare all somehow connected to the ine\ufb00able Clarissa, a society hostess who is also shown, through her fascinating\ninteriority, to be much deeper than we might take her for\nat \ufb01rst glance. Through light touches, we are transported\nfrom one consciousness to another, although Clarissa will\nhave the \ufb01nal say.\nWoolf writes with immense tenderness for her creations\nas though they were solid, breathing-eating humans; she\nalmost attempts to \u2013 but cannot - save them from their\nneuroses or even from the tendrils of societal values that\nare wringing their necks.\nThis tenderness perfectly exempli\ufb01es what I want most to\nrecommend about the book: it has a special quality that allows it to move one without becoming overly sentimental.\nMrs Dalloway takes place in vivid images. She sends Clarissa to the \ufb02orist and what follows in barely half a page is\na \ufb02orist better than reality could ever produce. The scene\nsticks so well to the mind that whenever I pass a \ufb02ower\nstall, the memory of this scene \u2013 and also of the shattered\nillusion created by a subsequent commotion, whereby we\nalight for the \ufb01rst time on the doomed Septimus Warren\nSmith \u2013 overpowers the creation of new memories.\nWoolf\u2019s metaphors litter everything like small, bright \ufb02owers would appear on a pavement. This can result in the emanation of a cloying perfume from the pages... so much so,\nthat it is impossible to read Mrs Dalloway in one \u2013 or even\nten \u2013 sittings. It is a book to be read slowly and carefully,\nensuring that it never becomes too sweet but also taking\ncrucial time to understand the minds of the people Woolf\nhas been so good as to introduce.\nFlash Fiction\nAn afternoon by the Thames\nby Evelyn Craven\nThere is nothing better to clear the mind than\na good ramble. The sun glistening o\ufb00 the river\nand peeking through the golden leaves above. An\noasis of calm in the middle of the city. All is well.\nThe Stars my Destination\nD\nespite my extensive\nfamiliarity with science\n\ufb01ction I had, until very\nrecently, had a major gap\nin my knowledge of the\n\ufb01eld \u2013 the works of Alfred\nBester. One of the foremost writers of\nthe late Golden Age of the genre, he has\nin\ufb02uenced later writers such as Phillip K.\nDick and William Gibson, as well as TV\nshows like Babylon 5 and Fire\ufb02y. Therefore,\n\ufb01nally settling down to read The Stars My\nDestination, one of his most famous and\nacclaimed works, I felt both excitement and\napprehension. After all, I had many times\nbeen greatly disappointed by severely over-hyped novels. However, this time, I needn\u2019t\nhave worried \u2013 The Stars My Destination\nmore than lives up to its lofty reputation.\nSet in the twenty \ufb01fth century the novel\npresents us with a solar system that has\nlong been settled by humanity and a society\nthat has been transformed by the recently\ndiscovered ability of all humans to jaunte\n\u2013 teleport to any location that they have\npreviously visited using their willpower\nalone. Our protagonist is Gully Foyle \u2013 the\nlast survivor of the transport spaceship\nNomad \u2013 crippled in a minor skirmish\nas part of the war between the inner and\nouter planets of the solar system. Stranded\non the drifting wreck of his ship for six\nmonths Gully begins to lose hope until he\nis approached by another spaceship. The\nship, however, ignores his signals for help\n\u2013 driving him to pledge revenge against its\ncrew. He repairs the Nomad and hatches an\nepic, Count of Monte Cristo style plot to\nbring his quarry to justice.\nThe plot and characters are certainly well\nthought out and engaging. The prose is\nclear and functional, though if one wanted\nto be uncharitable one might call it plain.\nWhat really makes the book stand out,\nhowever, is its setting and its themes. Over\nthe course of his journey Gully travels all\nover Earth and the Solar System \u2013 allowing\nBester to show o\ufb00 his considerable powers\nof imagination. He creates many unique\nand wonderful settings and environments\nwhich, even \ufb01fty years after the novel was\npublished still feel unique and innovative\nwhile never seeming too unbelievable.\nDespite its often outlandish nature, the\nreader gets the feel that this is really what\nthe world would be like if jaunting and\nspace travel became commonplace.\nI have never seen a book so crammed\nwith di\ufb00erent ideas. In some ways The Stars\nmy Destination is \ufb01rmly entrenched in\nMaciej Matuszewski discusses an SF classic\natmosphere of the Golden Age \u2013 featuring,\nas it does, the colonisation of the solar\nsystem, robots and outlandish science.\nHowever, it also explores elements, such\nas telepathy, more common in New Wave\nSF and even touches on almost cyberpunk-like themes of megacorporations and\ncybernetic enhancement. In the hands of\na lesser writer this might all come together\nto seem confused and disjointed but\nBester somehow manages to make it all \ufb01t\ntogether.\nThe result is a truly exhilarating novel,\nwhich never fails to surprise with where it\ntakes you next. The action, story and themes\nbuild as the novel progresses until the truly\nstunning climax (which features some\namazing typographical experiments used to\nportray synaesthesia in a way which would\nbe considered avant-garde even today).\nI have read few other books that are as\ninventive, engaging and simply exhilarating\nas The Stars My Destination. I can certainly\nsee the reason for the massive in\ufb02uence\nthat it has had subsequent generations of\nwriters. It might not necessarily be high\nliterature but I guarantee that this is a book\nthat you won\u2019t be able to put down and that\nwill stay with you for a long time after you\n\ufb01nish it.\nStudent picks\nEva Rosenthal picks:\nMrs Dalloway by Viriginia Woolf\nSend your submissions\nforourregularfeatures!\nFLASH FICTION: Ultrashort\nfiction up to 200 characters\nSTUDENT PICKS: Send us up\nto 250 words on your favourite book and how it changed\nyou\nbooks.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n\n"

    "content": "10 FRIDAY 15 NOV\nCOMMENT\nEditors: Eoghan J.\nTotten, Tessa Davey\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nTibet: a brighter future than the rest of China\nL\nately an article in Felix,\n\u201cWhat does the future hold\nfor Tibet\u201d has received great\nattention, calling for peace\nand independence for Tibet.\nWhile attempting to maintain a sound\nargument,thisarticlesuppliedseverely\nfalsi\ufb01ed evidence and subjectively\ninterpreted facts. A disgrace to truth,\nand as such I endeavor to \ufb01ght against\ninjustice.\nMy dear MSc Geophysics friend,\nTibet does not encompass a quarter\nof the Chinese landmass. This \u2018fact\u2019\nstated by the original author derived\nfrom the assumption that Tibet\noriginally comprises Qinghai province\nand parts of Sichuan province, and\nTibet Autonomous Region (TAR)\nhas shrunk to its current size due to\nthe suppression of the (majority Han)\nChinese. What a hypocrite! Claiming\nthe land of other ethnic minorities\nto be Tibetan! Hopefully the author\nknew that ethnic Han were the group\nof people of whom she simply referred\nto as \u2018Chinese\u2019. The ethnic Mongolians\nand Uyghurs are the natives of\nQinghai, whereas the mountainous\nSichuan has been sparsely populated\nby any people until Qing dynasty.\nSince Qing dynasty (17th century),\nTibet has always been part of China\nhence it is simply out-of-nowhere\nto blame the PRC government of\noccupying Tibet in 1952.\nWhile attempting to claim the\nvast of Western China ought to be\nTibet, the author has stated that the\npopulation of TAR is 13 million: 6\nmillion of Tibetans and 7 million\nof Chinese. Presumably the author\nmeant 7 million other Chinese; it is\nsimply jaw-dropping to see that at a\nscience and engineering university\nlike Imperial College London, one\nsupplies data with di\ufb00erence of\nseveral folds from that of the o\ufb03cial\ncensus of Tibet: in the last census in\n2010, 3 million people resided in Tibet\nAutonomous Region of China, while\n90% of the population were ethnic\nTibetans. It is highly questionable why\none may use data that largely deviates\nfrom what is scienti\ufb01cally evaluated\nand publically published, presumably\nto create ethnic tension in China.\nHowever this is not yet the most\nridiculous part. The author stated\nthat \u201chuman rights have failed,\nTibet\u2019s culture and religious practices\nhave been heavily oppressed\nand environmental destruction\nas a consequence of burgeoning\ninfrastructure\u201d. Long before Tibet\nbecame part of PRC, strict serfdom\nwas practiced in the autonomous\nTibet of Qing dynasty. Under the\ndisguise of Tibetan Buddhism, the\nTibetan society was a typical example\nof a feudalistic society. The majority\nof the Tibetan population were\nslaves, who had little human rights\nand merits of life. How dare one say\nthat the termination of slavery by the\nPRC is a failure of human rights? This\nliberation bene\ufb01ted the majority of the\nTibetans, while the minority, indeed\none person has lost his status as whom\nto be praised \u2013 the Dalai Lama. Under\nthe old systems of Tibet, Dalai Lama\nhas acted as a quasi-spiritual leader\nunder the disguise of religion, but the\ntruth is that he was a feudal emperor.\nThanks to the exile of the Dalai Lama,\nthe real Tibetan Buddhism can be\npracticed. Furthermore, the exile\nof Dalai Lama was voluntary: he\ndemands full control over Tibet, or he\nleaves.\nIt is no wrong that the rest of China\nprovides economic support for Tibet.\nIf the burgeoning infrastructure in\nTibet is to be blamed; if the plans of\nan airport are to be criticized; if the\nnew 5000-room hotel to be built in\nLhasa is to be condemned; this is\nsimply implying that Tibet will be\nbetter o\ufb00 without them. This makes us\nwonder if the author has a completely\ndi\ufb00erent conception of \u2018development\u2019\ncompared to that of the rest of us.\nUnder the governmental exchange\nprogrammes, the school that I\nattended (the best public school in\nthe district with the highest GDP\nin Beijing) was obliged to accept\n10% Tibetan students into the class.\nMany of these students have travelled\noutside Tibet for the \ufb01rst time of their\nlives and are enjoying much better\neducation. The Han Chinese students\nnever discriminate against them, as\nthey simply always knew that \u201cthe\nethnic minorities are also Chinese\u201d.\nThe ethnic minorities, including the\nTibetans are not subject to the famous\n\u2018One Child Policy\u2019, in order to preserve\ntheir own culture and customs. In the\nnational university entrance exam,\nbonus points were awarded simply\nfor being an ethnic minority, due\nto their disadvantaged educational\nbackgrounds.\nLast but not least, the economic\nsupport which the more developed\nareas gave to Tibet is simply more\nthan one can imagine. The revenue\ngenerated from tourism, the\nopportunities of trade with the east,\nthe funds which Tibet receive in the\nname of developmental support, are\nall the bene\ufb01ts Tibet receive simply\nfor being part of China. It is highly\nquestionable of one\u2019s intention, if\none proposes that saving Tibet is\nequivalent to being independent\nfrom the rest of China, risking to be\nreturned to the society of slavery\nunder the previous governance of\nDalai Lama.\nThe answer to the original author\u2019s\nquestion would be that Tibet holds an\neven brighter future than the rest of\nChina. Or maybe \u201cTibet holds an even\nbrighter future than that of what Dalai\nLama may o\ufb00er\u201d might be a more\ncoherent answer to that questioned by\nthe author in the article.\nHanwei Fang\nWriter\nT\nhere is a general feeling\nin our society that guys\nshouldn\u2019t hit girls. This is\ngreat. Girls shouldn\u2019t hit guys\neither, but on the occasions\nthat these rules should be bent, they\naren\u2019t. If you haven\u2019t guessed, I\u2019m\ntalking about martial arts, where men\nand women come together to train\nthemselves in self-defence \u2013 or attack.\nAs a woman who has been training\nin martial arts for the best part of\neight years, with numerous classes\nand sets of people, I\u2019ve always found\nit a struggle to get a guy to hit me.\nHard. This isn\u2019t masochism; this isn\u2019t\na cry for help. I simply want to train,\nand yet I have met and seen women\nsu\ufb00er with similar frustrations. So I\u2019m\nwriting to reach out to practitioners\nof martial arts and hopefully set the\nrecord straight.\nWomen join martial arts out of their\nown free will. This means they have\nmost likely weighed up the chances\nthey might get hurt and don\u2019t care.\nIt\u2019s part of learning how to defend\nyourself. Just as guys will \ufb01ght hard\nwith each other to prepare themselves\nfor real combat, women want to do\nthe same. We want to know that if the\nworst happens on a night out, we are\nready to defend ourselves. We want to\nknow that we are used to the challenge\nof dealing with force and punches that\nare thrown for real. If we were to ever\nbe hit, we don\u2019t want it to be a surprise\nthat catches us o\ufb00 our guard. We want\nto know that we\u2019ve been hit before;\nwe\u2019ve learnt to take it, to condition, to\nbounce back.\nAlthough it may seem like the\ngentlemanly thing to do, to hold back\non a strike, it is actually only doing\nyour partner a disservice. A class is a\ncontrolled environment where women\nand men alike want to learn to \ufb01ght,\nand what it\u2019s like to face an assailant.\nHolding back will only weaken their\ntechnique and leave them unprepared\nfor the real world.\nI know instructors who have\nwrongly spread this idea as well. There\nis an idea that training with a women\nis good, until you want to really try\nthe moves out. This is rubbish. Sure,\ndon\u2019t beat your partner up, but don\u2019t\nbase that on their gender. I hear\npeople complain that they\u2019re afraid\nthat they\u2019ll hurt their partner because\nthey\u2019re skinny or small or delicate.\nAgain, rubbish. If you swapped\nthat woman with a man of the same\nstructure and physique, would those\napprehensions still apply? For most of\nyou, I\u2019ll guess that the answer is no. So\nact on it. If gender is the only reason\nthat you\u2019re not putting your full e\ufb00ort\ninto helping your partner learn how to\ndefend themselves, change it now.\nI shouldn\u2019t just leave this message to\nthe men, because I\u2019ve seen it happen\namong women too. I\u2019ve seen women\nwho\u2019ll take pleasure in giving their\nmale partner hell, but who seem just\nas frightened to land a strike on their\nfemale partners. Ladies, it\u2019s a bad,\nbad circle we\u2019re creating. If we won\u2019t\npractice properly with each other, it\u2019ll\njust encourage other guys to think that\nthey can\u2019t too.\nSo fellow martial artists of all\ngenders; don\u2019t hold back on the\nwomen in your class. Give them\nthe same respect and e\ufb00ort as you\nwould to their male counterparts.\nIt\u2019s your job, as their partner, to give\nthem the best practice they can - take\nthat role seriously. And if it still feels\nuncomfortable, you can always just\nask. You might just be surprised.\nSusannah Molisso\nI.C. Wing Chun President\nThe only time you should hit a woman\nDalai Lama: Saint or sinner?\nI\u2019ve always\nfound it a\nstruggle to get\na guy to hit me.\nHard.\n\u201c\n\u201d\n\n"

    "content": "35\n@feliximperial\nFelixImperial\nFRIDAY 08 NOV\nA Blog Entry on Syria\nHee Jia Yun\nL\nast Thursday I attended a talk on humanitarian aid in Syria by Mr\nLouay El-Abed, a trustee of Syria Relief. I had heard much about\nSyria in the news, but I wanted to hear a \ufb01rst-hand account of the\nsituation from someone involved in mitigating the crisis. The talk\nturned out to be very inspiring and there were several points I\nfound really interesting.\nThe E\ufb00ects of Con\ufb02ict: Often, when con\ufb02ict is mentioned in reports, we\nsee \ufb01gures \u2013 of casualties, refugees, and so on. We don\u2019t always realise the\nmore subtle consequences on real people. Mr El-Abed described his visits\nto the refugee camps and said it was heartbreaking to see the helplessness\nin refugees\u2019 eyes. These people could only sit around waiting for their food\nto arrive. I think what\u2019s worse than su\ufb00ering unfortunate circumstances\nis being unable to do anything to improve the situation for yourself and\nyour loved ones. Sometimes people complain about being busy, but from\nanother angle I think at least we\u2019re lucky in being able to do work that will\nlead to a better future. Perhaps, for people stuck in ruts in life, the best way\nto help them is to give them the chance to help themselves. Syria Relief has\nactually done that, by setting up workshops for refugee ladies where they\ncan work (e.g. make knitted products) to earn money.\nThe trauma of the violence, especially for children, is something else. Mr\nEl-Abed was involved in \ufb01lming a documentary and the \ufb01lming crew took\nhalf an hour just to get one child to smile. While that was admittedly an\nisolated case, it is somewhat shocking to realize that an entire generation\ngrows up through such emotional turmoil.\nProfessionals/Expertise: Professional ability comes in really handy. For\ninstance, medical expertise is incredibly important, especially due to the\nincreased number of casualties. (On a side note, it is admirable how dedicated some Syrian doctors are. Apparently, they are work around 18 hours\na day, especially since in some cases an entire city is left with not more\nthan 50 doctors.) As for engineers, other areas demand their skill. Wells\nhave to be built where there is disrupted access to clean water. Also, cheap\nprosthetic limbs have to be made for people to carry on with their lives.\n(Currently, they are made from drain pipes, costing around 20 pounds\neach.) In our \ufb01rst world environment, we tend to take various jobs for\ngranted. However, where con\ufb02ict disrupts normal life and people abandon their posts because they can\u2019t a\ufb00ord to stay, it becomes apparent how\nimportant these roles are. Part of Syria Relief\u2019s funds goes towards paying\ndoctors, bakers, and teachers so they can continue working in areas affected by the con\ufb02ict.\nAs a student, I think it\u2019s sometimes easy to lose sight of the purpose in\nstudying all those equations and spending hours on coursework. However\n(at least for me), I think it helps to be reminded that it\u2019s useful to develop\na \ufb01eld of professional expertise, because it equips you to make life better\nfor others.\nDelivering Aid E\ufb00ectively: Donors often worry that their money will be\nmisappropriated, so it was interesting how Syria Relief aims to delivers aid\ne\ufb00ectively so as to alleviate the su\ufb00ering of Syrians as much as possible.\nFor instance, collaboration and coordination appears crucial in ensuring\ne\ufb03cient operations. Syria Relief communicates with their counterparts\nin other countries so that they each concentrate on di\ufb00erent cities. Also,\nSyria Relief can reach out to people within the borders because being comprised of Syrians, they have contacts in the local communities. Finally, the\namount of payback on money spent is evaluated, in view of the intention\nto help those most in need as much as possible. For example, Mr El-Abed\nsaid it wouldn\u2019t be worth it for students to volunteer in Syria, because the\ncost of the \ufb02ight ticket alone could keep three doctors working on the\nground (who could make a real impact).\nAfter the talk, one of the biggest questions naturally was \u2013 how can\nwe help? From abroad, we can support organizations working in Syria,\nthrough donations and awareness raising. One such organization is Syria\nRelief, and you can \ufb01nd out more about them at http://www.syriarelief.\ncom/.\nRCSU\u2019s annual Science Challenge is launching for this year on December 3rd. Previous years have included a tour\nof CERN as a prize for the overall winner. This tour of CERN was offered by past RCSU President & Science\nChallenge Chair Dr Jad Marrouche.\nDr Marrouche is the man responsible for founding the Science Challenge, as the first president of the newly-formed RCSU. In fact he was presented with an Outstanding Service Award in 2007 \u201cfor leading and effectively\nbuilding a dynamic faculty Union.\u201d He is currently a research associate with the Department of Physics based at\nCERN. He did his PhD there as part of the High Energy Physics Group. As a postgraduate student he received a\nStudentAwardforOutstandingAchievementinrecognitionofhisoutreachwork.HeisalsotheDeputyPresident\nof the Royal College of Science Association, the RCSU\u2019s alumni organisation.\nDr Marrouche is still involved with the Science Challenge and will be judging this year\u2019s video entries. Fiona\nHartley, RCSU Broadsheet editor, caught up with him in between seminars and meetings to ask him about the\ninception of the Science Challenge, as well as inquire as to how he secured his position at the world\u2019s largest\nphysics laboratory.\nRCSU\u2019s Interview with\nDr Jad Marrouche\nRCSU: How did you come to\narrange the Science Challenge?\nJM: The inspiration behind it\nwas actually the centenary of\nCollege, and tying that in with the\nreformation of the Royal College\nof Science (RCS) as a union after\nit had been split into the natural\nsciences and physical sciences. I\nwas lucky to be the \ufb01rst president\nof the reformed RCS so we\nwanted to make some sort of an\nevent, if you like; some sort of a\nlegacy that would be repeated and\nturned into a tradition. I think we\nmanaged to achieve that in the\nend.\nIt came about from that. John\nSanderson was the president\nof the Royal College of Science\nAssociation at the time. He\ndonated a thousand pounds of\nhis own money to try to make\nthe Science Challenge happen,\nthe \ufb01rst time we tried it. We had\na pilot year, the year before the\nRCSU became the RCSU again,\nand it was very successful.\nAfter that, we decided to turn it\ninto something big. So as opposed\nto just having Imperial students\nwe opened the competition up\nto the schools around the whole\nnation. And because we had the\nCollege centenary we were able\nto get some sponsorship; this was\nbefore the credit crunch so there\nwas a lot of sponsorship from\nvarious people.\nSo in the end the \ufb01rst year we\nheld the Science Challenge\ncoincided with three things: a\ncelebration of the RCSU o\ufb03ce,\nwhich we had campaigned hard to\nget \u2013 beforehand we didn\u2019t have\nthat space. There was also the\ncelebration of the \ufb01rst year of the\nRCSU, as well as the centenary of\nthe College.\nWe had a \u00a310,000 prize I think.\nThat was a huge prize. And we\nhad the \ufb01nal in the Ritz. That was\nthe single biggest cheque I\u2019ve ever\nwritten. It was around \u00a324500 for\nthat evening, thereabouts. We had\nto get it signed o\ufb00 by the College.\nBut it was extremely successful.\nWe had a huge waiting list for the\ntickets. The tickets were \u00a320 and\nthey sold out very, very quickly,\nwithin about twenty minutes of\ngoing on sale. The waiting list was\nlonger than the actual number of\ntickets.\nRCSU: How did you get Lord\nRobert Winston involved? Did\nhe just see that it was happening\nand want to be involved, or\u2026?\nJM: It was basically because of\nthe Head of Outreach at the time,\nMel Thody. She knew him quite\nwell, and when I approached her\nand said I wanted to expand the\nScience Challenge to schools,\nshe asked me to speak with him.\nWe arranged a meeting and he\nwanted to get on board with it.\nHe\u2019s a very famous \ufb01gurehead and\nhe\u2019s now kind of the champion of\nthe project.\nRCSU: He de\ufb01nitely is. So, you\ngraduated some time ago and\nyou work at CERN now. How\ndid you get there?\nJM: I \ufb01nished my undergraduate\ndegree in physics in 2007. I then\ndid a PhD with Imperial, based\nout at CERN, working on the\nCMS experiment. In the Large\nHadron Collider experiment\nthere are four main experiments:\nCMS, ATLAS, ALICE and LHCb.\nCMS and ATLAS are general-purpose detectors, in the sense\nthat they are not looking for a\nspeci\ufb01c signature but are able to\nreconstruct any signatures out\nthere.\nMy PhD was e\ufb00ectively\ncommissioning the algorithm for\nthe CMS trigger system. That\u2019s a\nspeed camera, if you like. We\u2019re\nnot able to save every event that\nhappens at the LHC, so we have\nto make a decision on which ones\nto save. The reason we have to\ndo this is because the events that\nwe\u2019re interested in happen one in\nevery ten million or ten billion\ntimes that there is a collision. So\nyou need a high collision rate to\nsee such events.\nBut obviously you don\u2019t want to\nsave ten billion events to see one;\nyou want to save a hundred to\nsee one. So you need some sort\nof algorithm that will \ufb01lter the\nevents. That\u2019s what I was involved\nin, in part.\nRCSU: That\u2019s pretty interesting.\nFinally, you\u2019re the Deputy\nPresident of the Royal College\nof Science Association.\nJM: Yeah. You know more about\nme than I do!\nRCSU: Hardly! But can you tell\nus a little bit more about the\nRCSA?\nJM: I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s that\nmuch to say about it because it\u2019s\nnot yet a fully-developed thing, it\u2019s\nstill also in its infancy, growing,\nlike the RCS. It\u2019s a relatively old\norganisation, yes, but it\u2019s relatively\nnew in some ways\u2026\nRCSU: Yes, I\u2019ve noticed that the\nRCS has quite a lot of history,\nbut obviously everything is\nsomehow quite new these days\nbecause of the fact that it was all\nsplit up.\nJM: Yes, exactly. Hopefully in\nthe years to come the RCSA will\nbecome a much stronger alumni\nassociation. But the idea is that\nit gives graduates a link back to\nImperial and to the RCS after\nthey\u2019ve left. It\u2019s not as active as\nit could be, but I\u2019m hopeful that\nwithin the next few years we will\nsee its resurgence.\n\n"

    "content": "28 FRIDAY 15 NOV\nGAMES\nEditor: Maximilian\nEggl, Calum Skene,\nImran Rashid\ngames.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nMaximilian Eggl\nGames Editor\nAfter a super successful Xbox 360,\nwhich most people claim won\nthe last console generation wars,\nMicrosoft is now releasing the next\niteration into a less clear cut market.\nThe hardcore gaming sector as such\nis being threatened by smartphone\nand tablet dominated casual games.\nThis situation is now reflected by\nMicrosofts approach with the One.\nInstead of just focusing on just\ngaming the redmond based company\nhas packed the One with tons of\nfeatures to bring in new customers\nthat wouldn\u2019t usually buy a console.\nHowever this decision has lead\nto an extreme backlash from the\ncore consumers that Microsoft\nneeds for this console to really\nsucceed. Their fail at the E3 really\ndampened a lot of excitement that\nhad been surrounding the console\npre-announcement. They decided to\nfocus on the TV and media aspects\nof the \u201cgaming console\u201d at a Gaming\nconvention which a lot of gamers\nfound worrying. Furthermore this,\ncoupled with the decision that a\npermanent online connection was\nneeded to play, as well as inhibiting\nthe resale and loaning out of games\nthat seemed to have knocked the nails\ninto this once promising console.\nXbox, One for you?\nSony has been releasing top notch\nconsoles for almost 2 decades now,\nand therefore the PS4 has a lot\nriding on its shoulders. While the\nPS3 was a great console, somehow\nit just wasn\u2019t the best that we\nexpected of Sony. Enter the PS4.\nAlmost 5 years in the making, this\nconsole just like the Xbox One has\nbeen surrounded by quite a lot of\nhype. However in stark contrast to\nMicrosofts E3 announcement, Sony\nthrived during their announcement\nand were said to have \u201cwon\u201d at that\nconvention. Furthermore Sony\nhas used all the negative publicity\nthat their rival incurred to further\ntheir own cause. Quite an amusing\n\u201cadvert\u201d as well as gleeful jibes by\nSony executives has seen Sony\u2019s\nstock rise, and their reputation as\nthe defenders of hard core gaming\nhas been cemented. This has lead\nto optimism about the potential\nof the upcoming PlayStation.\nHowever this \u201cdefence\u201d is not\njust based on what Xbox has done\n(or decided not to do), but is also\nbacked up by the stats of the PS4.\nWith quite impressive graphics\nas well as very respectable RAM,\nthis console should play games\nvery nicely. Furthermore the price\nis very attractive. Significantly\ncheaper than the Xbox One (and\nin fact even the PS3), this product\nhas gotten itself in a great position\nto win this round of console battles.\nFurthermore, while the Xbox One\ncould only run COD: Ghosts at 720p,\nthe PS4 has the got the full 1080p.\nThis is really good news for Sony, as\ngamers value graphics as one of the\ntop things of their gaming experience\nAnd yet for all the promised\ntechnologies and low price, the lack\nof a knockout console exclusive is\na bit worrying. With the delay of\nWatchdogs by Activision, there is\nno real great game there that many\npeople say they need to have on a\nconsole. While you are willing to\nsave \u00a380 on the console, and can get\nmost of the games that the Xbox etc.,\nis that enough to compensate for\nwatching in envy when your friend\ncanboastabouthiskillstreakonhalo?\nSo now the question for the Sony\nconsole: Should you go for the\nPlayStation 4? If you are impressed\nby good graphics, smooth gameplay\nand free sharing (up to publishers)\nthen I would go for the PS4. The\nsmaller price tag is also another\nreason to go for the PS4! However\nin the end the choice is up to you,\nare you more gamer, less flexible but\nwith more power and technology\nor do you wan to habe a bit of\neverything? It\u2019s your choice afterall.\nYet Microsoft was not ready\nto concede defeat to Sony so\neasily. They reversed (at least\nsomewhat) on most of their negative\ndecisions (which also caused some\nuproar on the internets forum\nstrangely enough). However this\nis probably what has still kept the\nOne in the running to still take\nthis generation\u2019s console crown.\nNow we are right just before the\nrelease of the Xbox One, and things\nare looking up from just a few\nmonths ago. The negative details of\nthe E3 announcement and following\ndithering of Microsoft have been\nforgotten and the positives have\nstayed in mind. There is just one\nstumbling block that new Xbox\nneeds to overcome: the price. Over\n\u00a3420 is quite a bit more than the\nearlier generation and given that\ncompetitors have given their devices\nquite a bit cheaper price tag, this\nmay make gamers think twice about\nforking out that kind of money.\nYet compared to the PS4 and\nWii U, the One has a strong line\nup of exclusives which may yet\nsway the hardcore gamers. Titles\nsuch as Titanfall and Dead Rising\n3 will grace the shelves at launch.\nOne last worrying caveat, Call of\nDuty: Ghosts, one of the big name\ngames, does not run at full HD on\nthe Xbox One. Apparently this is\ndue to the fact that even though the\nOne does support 1080p, Infinity\nWard (the publishers) have decided\nfor stabilities sake that 720p is\nall they could offer on the One.\nWhat does this mean for smaller\ntitles? Will the full HD experience\never come to the new Xbox?\nNow the question: Should you go\nfor the Xbox One? If you (or your\nparents) have some money to burn,\nand are unsure, you should consider\nthe Xbox. It has very decent specs and\nthe opening line up of games is very\nrespectable. Just keep in mind that this\nconsole is not solely aimed at gamers\nand therefore will not be as perfectly\ntailored to gaming as other consoles\nmay be. Furthermore the need to be\nonline once every 24 hours, as well as\nlack of open resale is very annoying,\nand so should be kept in mind.\nHowever you also get several positives\nwhich allow this device to be used for\nseveral other purposes (movies, tv,\nmedia etc.) which a traditional console\nmay not be. In the end it is your choice\nthough, and you have to do decide\nwhether you value a multifunctional\nconsole or a gaming console more.\nPlayStation 4 you?\nGames ... is ... back\n\n"

We\u2019ve all been there: start watching a new series, thinking it looks pretty cool, and next thing you know, you\u2019re nine series\nin and have no idea why you\u2019re still watching, but too emotionally invested to stop (here\u2019s looking at you, Supernatural).\nEnter the miniseries.

In fact, miniseries tend to be of\nhigher quality than their lengthier counterparts, most likely because the creators of the show have a de\ufb01nite end to work towards and there\u2019s little time for \u2018\ufb01ller\u2019 episodes.

It presents\nthe reality of Operation Iraqi Freedom, unvarnished and unprejudiced:\nlong stretches of boredom punctuated by moments of high intensity\n\ufb01ghting; the inexperience of the new\nrecruits, the \ufb01rst generation of Americans brought up in a lifetime of peace\nto be thrown into the harsh reality\nof war; and the incompetence of the\ncommanders in charge of \u2018liberating a\ncountry\u2019.\nWith only seven episodes, Generation\nKill is near \ufb02awless in its execution.\nThis is war, un\ufb01ltered: the dialogue is\nrazor sharp, hilarious and brutal by\nparts. The show keeps the heavy use-age of military slang so as to seem authentic as possible (examples include\n\u2018Victor\u2019 for vehicle, \u2018Oscar Mike\u2019 for\n\u2018on the move\u2019, as well as some that are\nless savoury - we\u2019ll leave \u2018Combat Jack\u2019\nto your imagination) which means it\nmay take one or two episodes to fully\nunderstand what\u2019s going on, but a little patience will soon pay o\ufb00.\nMost of the series is seen through\none \u2018Humvee,\u2019 the light armoured jeep\nin which the Marines travel. Journalist Evan Wright (known only to the\nsoldiers as \u2018Rolling Stone\u2019) is placed to\nobserve the men in a Humvee led by\nSgt. Brad \u2018Iceman\u2019 Colbert, played by\nAlexander Skarsgard, a well-respect-ed soldier with serious reservations\nabout the capabilities of his superiors.\nHis second in command, Ray Person,\nprovides much of the series\u2019 humour\nas the sarcastic, hyperactive, Avril\nLavigne singing driver of the jeep.\nOne of the best yet surreal characters,\n\u2018Fruity\u2019 Rudy Reyes, is actually played\nby his real-life Marine counterpart.\nThe series is often shocking in its\nhonesty. Many events which, while\nwatching, I assumed must have been\n\ufb01ctionalised are taken directly from\nthe book, frequently grimly re\ufb02ecting\nGeneration Kill\nthe events in Iraq. Neither glorifying\nnor condemning the acts of the soldiers it follows, Generation Kill should\nbe required viewing for anyone wanting an insight into the chaotic nature\nof wars in the last ten years.\nPride and Prejudice\nThe miniseries that gave your mum\nher sort-of-disturbing obsession with\nColin Firth, BBC\u2019s Pride and Prejudice\nis a far better adaptation of Jane\nAusten\u2019s novel than the more recent\n\ufb01lm starring Keira Knightley. Widely\npraised by critics and audiences\nalike, the series sought to remain\nfaithful to its source material while\nmaking it accessible for non-Austen\nfans, ramping up the sexual tension\nbetween Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy, and\nadding scenes with the Bennet sisters.\nThe series\u2019 six episodes follow the antics of the Bennet family, the mother\nof whom is determined to \ufb01nd husbands for her \ufb01ve daughters lest they\nbe left poor and shunned by society.\nWhile eldest daughter Jane is swept\no\ufb00 her feet by the charming Mr. Bingley, her cynical sister Elizabeth is left\noutraged by the manners of his friend,\nthe surly Mr. Darcy, who declares her\n\u2018tolerable, but not handsome enough\nto tempt me\u2019. Although their meeting\nis far from love at \ufb01rst sight, she slowly\ncomes to realise that there\u2019s more to\nDarcy than meets the eye. Meanwhile,\nyoungest sister Lydia gets herself into\ntrouble and risks bringing disgrace\non the family when she gets involved\nwith O\ufb03cer George Wickham.\nThe series catapulted Colin Firth - a\npreviously unknown actor - into fame,\nallowing him to go on to play the exact\nsame character in every Richard Curtis \ufb01lm ever made. The iconic scene\nwhere he emerges soaked from swimming in a lake was voted one of the\nmost unforgettable scenes in British\ntelevision and set alight the passions\nof middle-aged women everywhere in\nwhat was after all a happier, more in-nocent, pre-Fifty Shades of Grey time.\nThe series also inspired Helen Fielding\nto write the Bridget Jones novels, featuring its own Mr Darcy (also played\nby Colin Firth in the \ufb01lm adaptations).\nQuintessentially English, Pride\nand Prejudice has all the hallmarks\nof a great period drama, including\nscandalous elopements, repressed\nemotions, and top hats. Nonetheless,\nits themes of class, status and\nromance remain relevant for today\u2019s\naudiences, no doubt explaining why\nthe book is still so popular.\nPride and Prejudice may not o\ufb00er\nmany surprises, but it is one of the\nbetter adaptations of Austen\u2019s novel,\nbringing wit and heart to the story.\nAusten fans and novices alike will\nenjoy.\nHBO\nBBC\nTelevision for the\n\n"

Brecht tells the factual truth\nbut phrases answers in such a way to\nsuggest that he is nothing more than\nan anti-fascist agitator. Hammett, on\nthe other hand, is accused of managing\n\u201cGrub first, then ethics\u201d\ncommunist organizations funds \u2013 of\nwhich he knows nothing. Despite this\nHammett refuses to answer questions\nand is subsequently sent to prison.\n\u017di\u017eek is trying to make is about\ntruth\u2019s nature. He claims that, even\nthough Brecht cannot be accused of\nlying in terms of actual content (versus\nHammett), Hammett is nonetheless\nthe more \u2018honest\u2019 person. I endorse\nthis interpretation, otherwise \u017di\u017eek\u2019s\nclari\ufb01cations in the notes should\nillustrate the point. \u017di\u017eek mentions\na conformist philosophy teacher\nin the (then) communist Slovenia,\nwho would tell his students with a\n\u2018disarming smile\u2019 that \u2018I know I\u2019m\nscum.\u2019 The intention is obvious: by\nadmitting the mistake in advance I\nam precluding any criticism for it.\nThe situation is similar to Brecht who,\nwhen accused of cowardice, replied\nthat he was \u2018a writer, not a hero.\u2019\nOne criticism I have of \u017di\u017eek is that\n(perhaps) he missed a dimension.\nBrecht, by being dishonest in this\nroundabout way, demonstrated the\nmore \u2018objective\u2019 truth of Brecht\u2019s own\nambiguous ethical-political position.\nRather than being willing to endorse\nthe Stalinist cause Brecht tried to\nget the best of both worlds, endorse\nthe Party as a radical artistic \ufb01gure/\nintellectual but never join it and\nreally compromise himself morally by\nsupporting a system and ideology as\nvicious and monstrous as Stalinism.\nApropos the philosophy professor,\nChristy Kelly\nWriter\nis scum because of the attempted\ndisavowal in his claim that he is scum.\nIf he were a committed ideologue he\nwould be mistaken, wrong \u2013 evil. This\nlowest state of ethical apologism, this\npathetic example of Nietzsche\u2019s slave\nmorality which is in Badiou\u2019s terms\n\u2018beneath Good and Evil\u2019 should be\nfully rejected. As \u017di\u017eek viciously puts\nit \u2018Stop trying to pretend you\u2019re not\nscum by saying you are scum; you are\nscum!\u2019\nSo, what was the point of the\ndiscussion above? Nothing much,\nif I\u2019m honest. The ambiguity is fully\ncaptured in Brecht\u2019s brilliant \u2018Grub\n\ufb01rst, then ethics.\u2019 With Brecht as\nMarxist we assume the message is\n\u2018Don\u2019t moralise to me with your petty\nethics, I am dying of hunger. You,\nthe bourgeoisie are the criminals\nfor allowing this state of poverty to\nexist.\u2019 Think of Trevelyan, criticising\nthe Irish woman\u2019s culinary repertoire\nin famine stricken Ireland. A small\nthought experiment allows us to see\nwhere this principle falls down. Think\nof the Eichmann or the equivalent\nNazi mid-level bureaucrat. The Nazi\nmiddle classes, famous for their ethical\nself-justi\ufb01cations, latched onto such a\n\u2018socially progressive\u2019 view,feeling the\nneed to \u2018support their families\u2019.\nInstead of this real Brecht we should\nrecognise the greatness of the \u2018fake\npersona\u2019 Brecht. Brecht tells us the\ntrue way to \ufb01ght a famine, \u2018Hungry\nman, reach for a book: it is a weapon.\u2019\nO\nver the last few weeks Felix\nhas been investigating the\nproblems a\ufb00ecting students\nin halls in regards to cleaning.\nThis has been an ongoing\nissue that is e\ufb00ecting hundreds of students,\nsomething that could also have an e\ufb00ect on\ntheir study life as well. We look forward to\nhearing a response from the Campus Services\ndepartmentinregardstothechangestheyhave\nmade to the contract, in terms of how binding\nthe contract is, why the communication with\nstudents has not been optimal, and how they\nplan to operate the cleaning services over the\ncoming months.

The\nworking party was run by Marissa Lewis\n(Deputy President Welfare), who also\norganised this week\u2019s Sexual Health and\nGuidance (SHAG) Week events. After the\ndiscussions in the previous Council meeting,\nmany members were keen to read the\nworking party\u2019s report and go to a vote. When\nthe votes were cast it transpired that all but\nthree members of Council approved of the\npaper, while the remaining three abstained.\nUnion President David Goldsmith was tasked\nwith leading the Union\u2019s response to the billl,\nwith the aim of removing the possibility of\ninternational students being charged for using\nthe NHS, and also stopping the section of the\nbill that would make landlords pay a \ufb01ne for\nnot checking the immigration status of their\ntenants (something many have been afraid\nwould cause international students problems\nwhen it came to looking for accommodation).\nJoseph Letts\nEditor-in-Chief\nOf cleaning and Immigration Letters\nDear Felix Editor,\nI am sending in yet another letter, as I am\nonce again insulted by this \u2018Paladin\u2019, who\napparently lives in the \u201cmight of the light\u201d.\nMe, a \u201cweed smoking hippie\u201d?

While inherently this is not something nega-tive, it does make me a bit sad. Yes,\nthere are some great apps out there\nthat help your child learn and grow,\nbut more often than not these kids\nare playing angry birds which is not\nas positive as you may think (e.g.\nsubconscious hatred towards green\npigs)! Playing outside and exploring\nthe world, making a castle out of a\nfew pillows with your imagination\nand just using up that boundless\nenergy that children seem to possess is something that is lost when\nyou hand your child a tablet. It is\neasier, and allows for the parents\nIn our day and age everything has a\ncamera attached to it. Your phone,\nyour mp3 player, my god, even your\nfridge could have a camera for all we\nknow. Therefore it is not a surprise\nthat your tablet has a camera. How\nmany times have you seen someone\nwith their tablet in the air, awkwardly\ntrying to take a picture? Yes, I agree\nwith you, too many times (if you are\none of those people who tries to do\nthis, I curse you to hell). Why would\nyou use this relatively heavy device,\nwith an inferior camera to take pic-tures? It is unwieldy, and compared\nto the camera that you could pull out\nfrom your camera the quality of the\ntaken picture will be much worse!\nThese guys used to be the bee\u2019s\nknees. Predicted to be the future of\nportable computing these guys have\nbeen almost completely forgotten. I\nmean, if you compare the elegance\nof a touch screen device which has\nits own dedicated OS, which does\nnot feeling like a cut down version,\nand less able to actually do things.\nThe downfall of the netbook can\nlargely also be attributed to the lack\nof actual usability. They had small\nscreens, almost non-existent memory and no RAM whatsoever. No\npoint in carrying one around if you\ncannot do everything you wanted to.\nWhile I believe paper and books\nwill never be entirely killed off in\nour life times, tablets have certainly\nlead to a revolution that has reduced\nthe amount there are used and pro-duced. Ebooks have taken off, leading to their own pros and cons, you\nsee more and more students taking notes with iPads and my printing credit has sky rocketed since\nI got a tablet. Now I am not saying this is positive or negative, that\nis for you to decide, but anything\nthat reduces even a tiny amount\nof the paper we waste should be\nconsidered in a positive light.\nMaximilian Eggl\nTechnology Editor\nPapers and Books\nto have some downtime, but maybe\nonce in a while spend time with your\nchild and interact with them without\nthe help of an electronic medium.\nThis may be similar to the one ear-lier, however the e\ufb00ect has been felt\nmuch more keenly. The internet my\nhave started o\ufb00 the newspapers de-cline, however tablets are starting to\naccelerate it! Instead of having to buy\nyour newspaper from the local agent,\nor having it delivered to your door,\nyou can just download it on your tablet with no hassle whatsoever. This\nchange in the behaviour of the consumers has alarmed some newspapers\nand publications so far that some have\nleft their physical presence behind\nentirely and now inhabit the internet.\nThere is no doubt that technological advancements over the past few\ndecades have had immense impact\non our society. Those of us living comfortable lives in developed\ncountries celebrate the latest gadgets and how they have made our\nlives even simpler. But meanwhile,\nthere are still many people out there\nwho are struggling to gain access to\nclean water, affordable healthcare\nand basic education. Why has modern technology overlooked them?\nAccording to recent studies by\nNGOs and social enterprises, over\n2 billion people in the developing\nworld lack access to basic information and communication technologies (NoPC). More than 72\nmillion children around the world\nremain unschooled (Humanium)\nand over 1 billion people rely on\nunsafe sources of water (UN). If\nwe can use technology to better our already comfortable lives,\nwe certainly can do more using\ntechnology to make a difference\nto the lives of the less fortunate.\nThe rise of modern technology\nhas made production costs lower,\nadministering healthcare treatments easier and dissemination of\ninformation quicker. This makes\ntechnology one of the key components in accelerating social changes,\nby enabling people to do more and\ngive more. Many individuals and\norganisations have seen the potential in transforming the social sector through technology, and have\nbeen actively coming up with technological solutions that promise to\nalleviate pressing social problems.\nTake for example, PEEK, a London-based group, who are making\nhigh quality eye care portable, cost\neffective and intuitive in developing countries possible through the\nuse of smart-phone cameras. Not\nonly are smartphones portable and\ncost-effective, its simplicity in usage empowers more health workers to diagnose eye diseases and\nmanage such treatments anywhere\nin the world. With 285 million\nvisually impaired people world-wide, PEEK presents a much-needed alternative to high cost\ndiagnostic tests that are available\nmostly in high-income countries.\nThe pervasiveness of social networks in today\u2019s world also presents\ngreat opportunities to raise awareness about social issues. In this\naspect, Thunderclap helps causes\namplify their messages by pushing a\ntimedsocialmediapostfromalltheir\nsupporters. Individuals and organi-Elegance of making a\nphoto\nNetbooks\nNewspaper\nToddlers playing\ncreatively\nAndrew Ng on fostering social change through technology\nsations can now reach out to larger\naudiences with greater ease and ef-ficiency, by leveraging the power\nof social connections on the web.\nUltimately, bringing about social change through technology is\nnot about using the most advanced\ngadgets, but applying existing\nones to support and direct them.\nIf you have yet to notice, the common ground between the examples\nabove and many others is that only\nexisting technology are used, with\nslight modifications to address the\nproblems directly. We should keep\nin mind that inventing new technology doesn\u2019t help to solve social issues - applying them does.\nIf you would like to be further\ninspired by how technology can be\nused to create social change and\nempower people to do more social good, come along to CtrlAlt/\nChange 2013 right here at Imperial College London on 30th November. From a series of exciting\ntalks, interactive workshops, panel\ndiscussion and an \u201cIdeathon\u201d, CtrlAlt/Change 2013 aims to celebrate\ntechnology projects with social\nimpacts and champion new ones.\nEarly-bird tickets are now on\nsale for only \u00a38 till 16th November!

As long as the owner does\nnot dispense with Malky Mackay\u2019s\nservices, they can expect to \ufb01nish\nmid-table.\nChelsea\nIt hasn\u2019t all been plain sailing for the\nSpecial One on his return to Stamford Bridge. He needs to strike a balance between \ufb02air players and reliable\npowerhouses like Mikel and Mata. But\nhe has the players to potentially win\nthe title.\nCrystal Palace\nI\u2019m afraid I can o\ufb00er Palace no hope\nwhatsoever of avoiding relegation.\nThey need a new manager fast to inject some grit into mid\ufb01eld so they\ndon\u2019t become the next Derby County.\nEverton\nThe To\ufb00ees are very easy on the eye\nand Roberto Martinez is proving just\nhow good a manager he is. As ever a\ntop-six \ufb01nish should be their target;\nthat will be even more achievable if\nthey can turn some of their draws into\nwins.\nFulham\nThe Cottagers have looked like a\nSunday league side at times this sea-son. Martin Jol needs to \ufb01nd a way to\ninject some verve into an ageing side\nincreasingly prone to errors. They are\nmy dark horses for relegation.\nHull\nSteve Bruce\u2019s Tigers have worked extremely hard to establish a mid-table\nposition. They must continue to play\nto their strengths: a well-organised\ndefence and taking attacking opportunities when they arrive, and they will\nstay well clear of relegation.\nLiverpool\nThe Reds have made a barnstorming\nstart, thanks largely to Daniel Sturridge and Luis Suarez. They can dream\nof a top-four \ufb01nish again but do they\nhave the backup if their attacking stars\nsuccumb to injury or suspension?\nMan City\nManuel Pellegrini\u2019s side have one\nof the best attacks in Europe and the\nAguero-Negredo partnership has serious potential. It is in defence where\ntheir troubles lie but with Vincent\nKompany soon back from injury a second title looks a real possibility.\nMan United\nFrankly, David Moyes has endured a\ntorrid start. That killer instinct characteristic of Sir Alex\u2019s Red Devils is still\nmissing despite some promising signs\nof late. Things will get better though\nand their win against Arsenal means\nthey are still in the title race.\nNewcastle\nThe Magpies have lived up to their\nlongstanding reputation for inconsistency and Alan Pardew has been under\npressure despite Newcastle sitting\npretty in the top half. They will do well\nto stay there.\nNorwich\nChris Hughton looked a dead man\nwalking at half time against West Ham\nbut the Canaries \ufb01nally turned on\nthe style in the second half. The con\ufb01dence boost of winning before the\ninternational break could kick-start\ntheir season.\nINSIDE\nImperial Duathletes win in Hillingdon\nImperial romp\nhome again\nDavid Neilsen-Scott gives his account.\nA\nscrappy game of\nrugby looked to be\nthe order of the day\nas Imperial 1st XV\nwelcomed bottom of\nthe table Kent to a wet Harlington\nsports ground. Coming o\ufb00 the back of\nsuccessive 24-0 victories con\ufb01dence\nwas high in the home dressing room.\nWith fresher Masters student Tom\n\u2018the mole\u2019 Catchpole having done\nthe dirty on his old team, IC felt they\nknew the strengths and weaknesses of\ntheir opponents.\nKent kicked o\ufb00 playing with the\nwind behind them. Immediate\nhandling errors from Imperial and\na good line break from the outside-centre allowed Kent an early visit\ninto the home 22. The sloppy start to\nthe game continued as Imperial were\npenalised at the ruck, giving the Kent\ncaptain (Catchpole: \u201che\u2019s an incredible\nplayer\u201d) an easy chance in front of the\nposts. Imperial held their collective\nbreath, as the end of their 160 minutes\nof unbroken defence seemed nigh.\nThe kick \ufb02ew wide.\nEncouraged by this sign, IC grew\ninto the game and worked up the\npitch through the forwards, with\npowerful carries from O\u2019Connell,\nHardisty and Nielsen-Vinegar-Scott.\nUnder pressure, it was the turn of\nKent to infringe and James Cox made\nno mistake with his kick at goal to put\nIC 3-0 up.\nAs the half progressed there were\nan increasing number of dropped\nballs. The scrum count rose and props\nJon Lineham and Tom \u2018momentum\nfresher\u2019 Shuz stepped into the\nspotlight. Aided by the lithe, otter-like frame of Tom Hobson at hooker,\nthe Imperial front row \u201cmanshamed\u201d\ntheir rural counterparts. The resultant\npenalties allowed IC to gain good\n\ufb01eld position via the boot of Cox. The\nforwards battered towards the line\ndrawing in more and more of the Kent\ndefenders to repel the barrage, and\nwhen the ball went wide Catchmole\nwas in acres of space to touch the\nball down into the corner. Cox was\npredictably ba\ufb04ed by the faint breeze\nleaving the score 8-0.\nImperial stayed on top for the rest\nof the \ufb01rst half. A good kicking game\nfrom scrum- and \ufb02y-half, assisted by\nbreaks from centres Jack Flanagan\nand Jon Mann and some gangly yet\ne\ufb00ective counter-attacks from full\nback Josh O\u2019Donnell ensured IC were\ndominant. The proof came as skipper\nMike O\u2019Connell converted pressure\nSouthampton\nThe season\u2019s surprise package so\nfar, Mauricio Pochettino is looking an\ninspired appointment and although\nSaints\u2019 fabulous run will doubtless end\neventually, they can set their sights on\nplaying in Europe next term.\nStoke\nThe Potters have not won since\nAugust and \ufb01nd themselves looking\nnervously down the table. They scored\n3 against Swansea but have otherwise\nlooked toothless in attack and over\nthe winter months it is absolutely vital\nthey get some wins under their belt.\nSunderland\nGus Poyet has his work cut out at\nthe Stadium of Light. They are in a\nrelegation scrap and their season now\nis all about the \ufb01ght for survival. That\nsaid, a Tyne-Wear derby win and victory against Man City will do their\ncon\ufb01dence no harm.\nSwansea\nMany tipsters saw Swansea qualifying for the Europa League via a top\nsix \ufb01nish this season, but that looks\na distant hope. The strains of playing\nThursday-Sunday are taking their toll\nbut the Swans are still a good side and\nshould \ufb01nish mid-table.\nTottenham\nAndre Villas-Boas has faced a lot\nof criticism from fans despite a solid\nstart. The promise of entertaining\nfootball that came with Spurs\u2019 sizeable\nsummer outlay has not materialised.\nThe Champions League might be a\nbridge too far.\nWest Brom\nSteve Clarke\u2019s side continue to look\norganised defensively but his summer\nsignings have added a new attacking\ndimension to the Baggies as well. They\ncan realistically expect to \ufb01nish in the\ntop half.\nWest Ham\nUntil Andy Carroll returns the\nHammers will continue to struggle for\ngoals. It feels like damage limitation\nevery time they play and for now the\naim has to be to stay clear of the relegation zone.\ninto points, squeezing over in the\ncorner from a maul. The shock of\nscoring confused the Captain, forcing\nhim o\ufb00 the pitch to recover. It was\nImperial\u2019s International, recently\nreturned from representing Nigeria\nin the African Cup of Nations in Ivory\nCoast, Olisa Ufodiama who stepped\nin for his long awaited return- after\na slight reshu\ufb04e of the pack. Proving\nthat they were better with the Captain\no\ufb00 the pitch, IC built momentum, with\nOlisa crunching the Kent 15 to leave\nhim gasping on the ground trying to\n\ufb01nd his windpipe.\nThe half ended at 13-0 and the two\nprops gave way to Jake Bagby and Dave\nJones, deservedly making the team o\ufb00\nthe back of huge performances for\nthe 2nd XV last week. Both carried\non where their predecessors left o\ufb00,\nBagby taking a leaf from the WWE\nhandbook to extract both yards and\npenalties from his man whilst Jones\nshowed great enthusiasm in the\nloose. A classic IC driving maul in the\ncorner gifted Tom Hedley his third\ntry of the season with Cox slotting\nthe conversion to surely guarantee the\nresult at 20-0.\nWith Kent running for their white\ncli\ufb00s, more \ufb01ne work in the forwards\nculminated in Ufodiama breaking\nthrough the line from 30 meters out\nbefore o\ufb04oading to Hardisty. The\nClub Captain put his head down and\nthree trampled tacklers later added\n\ufb01ve points to Imperial\u2019s tally.\nThe Imperial forces marched on;\nreplacement winger Jack Dunning\nmade his mark at the breakdown,\nwinning a penalty in front of the\nsticks that any \ufb02anker would have\nbeen proud of. Cox put the ball over\nto make it 28-0 with around \ufb01ve\nminutes to go.\nIn a great display of determination\nKent rallied in the \ufb01nal moments of\nthe game, choosing to attack from\ndeep. Unfortunately for the visitors\na tap penalty on their own tryline\nonly served to send South African\npoacher Charles Price-Smith in for\nan interception try, who displayed\nstunning arrogance to swan dive\nunder the posts on debut. Cox was\nsuccessful with the conversion to give\na \ufb01nal score of 35-0.\nThe result places Imperial at the top\nof the league and now makes it over\n240 minutes since a point was last\nconceded.\nWith performances like this,\nImperial 1st XV will have an excellent\nseason.\n\n"

However,\nwhen it comes to the cup,\nleague form is thrown out of the\nwindow and we made the epic journey\nto North London with con\ufb01dence to\nplay RUMS (UCL Medics) 3s.\nDespite the biblical deluge in West\nLondon, Shenley seemed to have\nescaped the worst of the rain, leaving\nthat age-old saying: \u201cIt\u2019s grim up\nnorth\u201d with little credibility. After an\nimpeccably kept minute\u2019s silence for\nRemembrance Day, the game kicked\no\ufb00 and IC were straight on the front\nfoot. The untested mid\ufb01eld of Pia and\nSang worked well to retain the ball\nand started to launch attacks on the\nRUMS goal. It didn\u2019t take long for the\n\ufb01rst chance to materialise with Fogo\nbeing found unmarked by Frosty 5\nyards out. Unfortunately thanks to\nhis hideous new sky blue and orange\nboots, purchased in soft ground and\nhard ground to single handedly \u201cbreak\nthe Nike and Adidas duopoly\u201d, he\nmanaged to put the ball over the bar. It\ndidn\u2019t take him long to make amends\nhowever as again Frosty whipped\nanother delicious ball into the box,\nwhich Fogo managed to squeeze into\nthe corner. Within ten minutes it\nwas 2-0. Tremendous wing play was\na running theme in the half and this\ncontinued with Stewart cutting inside\nand putting in another great cross.\nUnder no pressure at all the RUMS\ncentre back thought this was the time\nto demonstrate some \u201cexperienced\u201d\ndefending and nod the ball back to his\nkeeper, who somehow conspired to\nsimultaneously save it above his head\nand let it through his legs into the\nnet. The \ufb01rst half yielded one solitary\nchance for RUMS, a speculative e\ufb00ort\nfrom 30 yards which hit the bar,\nbut the 6s went into half time fairly\ncomfortable. Inevitably the opposition\ncame out \ufb01ring after such a lacklustre\nhalf but the back four of Raguenez,\nWood, Coney 2013 and Widdows\neasily absorbed the pressure, reducing\nthem to pot shots from distance, the\nbest of which was a free kick easily\nheld by keeper Stillwell. Widdows then\nshowed strong technique by slipping\nover but in the process launching into\na John Terry-esque salmon dive to\nhead the ball away. At this point Fogo\ndecided that scoring was far easier\nwithout a goalkeeper in the way. A\nZarucki header put him through and\nhe rounded the keeper before slotting\nhome. 5 minutes later he completed\nhis hattrick by nutmegging the RUMS\ncentre back before again rounding\nthe keeper and rolling the ball into\nthe empty net. To \ufb01nally rub salt into\nthe wounds Fogo netted his fourth,\nrunning onto a delightful chip from\nPia to again round the keeper and\nclip into the net. 5 minutes later and\nthe \ufb01nal whistle went with so much\nto savour: 4 goals for Fogo, \ufb01rst win\nof the season, \ufb01rst clean sheet of\nthe season, next round of the cup,\nWiddows and Coney \ufb01nally moving\ninto positive fantasy football points\nand the prospect of teaching the\nancient art of matchbox to the netball\ngirls later that evening.\n5-0 - TOO EASY.\nICUAFC is sponsored by:\nImmortals\nwin 6-0\nHaving beaten the Westminster\nDragons in week one of their\nseason, the Imperial Immortals\nwere looking to continue their\nwinning streak away from home at\nthe Greenwich Mariners.\nLast season the Immortals put\n41 points past the Mariners, but\nhaving beaten LSBU Spartans in\ntheir \ufb01rst match of the season, the\nMariners had clearly put in a lot of\nhard work in their preseason and\nwere not to be underestimated.\nThe match began with Alex\nBrockhurst kicking o\ufb00 deep into\nthe Mariners\u2019 half. The special\nteams unit got to the ball quickly\nand stopped the return, giving the\nopposition a poor starting \ufb01eld\nposition.\nThe Immortals\u2019 defense fended\no\ufb00 the Mariners\u2019 run and pass\ngame, which forced them to\npunt on their fourth down. Rob\nWolstenholme caught the punt but\nwas tackled by the Mariners before\nhe could get up to speed.\nOur o\ufb00ense then took the\n\ufb01eld and began to drive on the\nMariners\u2019 defense. Big carries from\nMarcus Stead-Hall and Duncan\nMacKinnon put the Immortals in\nthe red zone. The defense grew\nwise to the run game and this was\nwhen rookie quarterback Toby\nSinclair sprinted into the end zone\nfor a touchdown, his third of the\nseason. Having failed the point\nafter attempt the score stood at\n6-0.\nAlex Brockhurst again kicked\no\ufb00; this time he kept it low, driving\nit deep into the Mariners\u2019 half. The\nbouncing ball made it awkward for\nthe returners and once again they\nfailed to gain any good yardage.\nThe game then became scrappy,\nwith both sides giving away\nunnecessary penalties.\nThe match continued with both\nsides making short drives due\nto the defensive e\ufb00orts made by\nboth sides. The immortals\u2019 o\ufb00ense\nwas stopped due to the talented\nMariners\u2019 defensive line. Dexter\nValencia made key plays for the\nImmortals, recovering a fumble\nand catching an interception.\nHaving pinned the Mariners\u2019\ndefense back to their goal line,\nthey were forced to try an all or\nnothing play to take the game into\novertime. Their quarterback threw\nthe ball deep to a wide receiver;\nluckily he was well covered by\nArjav Trivedi who intercepted the\nball.\nNext week the Immortals are\nback at Harlington hosting KCL\nRegents in their third regular\nseason match.\nHenry Badham\nImmortals Press Secretary\nIC FOOTBALL\n\n"

The union\u2019s Syria\nappeal closes next week and can accept\nblankets and medicines, and multiple\nappeals or support of the Philippines are\nalso being held. So how does all this work?\nThe Syria appeal launched back in Spring Term\nwhen the crisis came to a head \u2013 to date, sources\nincluding the UN estimate that 100,000 people\nhave been killed in the con\ufb02ict, many of them\nchildren. The international community was\noutraged over the summer by the use of chemical\nweapons, which both sides continue to blame each\nother for. Though this did once again bring the\nnationwide appeals to the forefront of the public\nmind, the response has been far from su\ufb03cient.\n2 million people have registered as internationally\ndisplaced from their homes (N.B this is just the\nnumber that have registered \u2013 there are many\nmore who are not registered), and also another\n4-5 million who are internally displaced. These\nrefugees are directly vulnerable to the con\ufb02ict\u2019s\nbrutality, in squalid camps, many near the Turkish\nborder where clean water, food, shelter and\nmedical attention are in very short supply.\nThe appeal for aid to the Philippines is structured\nvery di\ufb00erently to the Syria appeal. The UK has\na committee formed of 14 charities known as\nthe \u2018Disasters Emergency Committee\u2019. They\nmeet after such disasters and organise what the\nUK\u2019s national response to the disaster will be. At\npresent, the UK has dispatched medical assistance\nand pledged a minimum of \u00a35 million.\nAlthough this might sound like a lot, when you\nconsider that over 10,000 people are thought to\nhave died in the \ufb02attened city of Tacloban alone,\nthat the president has declared a state of \u2018National\nCalamity\u2019 and that over 600,000 have been\ndisplaced it doesn\u2019t really go all that far. I always\n\ufb01nd it surprising how easily the public can match\nor even exceed the amount that the government\npledges.\nSo what can you do to help? For the Philippines\nthis is much easier, as the appeals are running\nnationwide. For Syria, you can drop o\ufb00 items\nin SAC next week. More details can be found\non the Islamic Society Facebook page. If that\u2019s\nnot enough, there are also further ways to get\ninvolved \u2013 from \ufb02ying out there yourself (not\nrecommended) to running fundraisers on campus\n(very much recommended \u2013 I\u2019ll happily help out!)\nAnyhow that\u2019s all for now\nThere is an items collection for an\naid convoy that will be leaving for Syria\nnext weekend. This is an opportunity\nfor you to directly make a di\ufb00erence\nto people\u2019s lives! Old clothes will be\nused to generate funds and new ones\nwill be sent to Syria. The Union is also\nhelping and we have a drop o\ufb00 point at\nthe Union reception. There are more\ndetails on the website.\nOne of the organisers commented\n\u201canyone can contribute, as students\nwe tend to have a lot of little things\nthat we rarely use or wear; this little\nwill go a long way, it will provide them\nwith hope and show the Syrian people\nthat others in the world do care and do\nremember.\u201d\nOne of the students response to\nthe campaign was \u201cIt\u2019s easy to feel\npowerless in the face of things that\nshock and upset us, yet instead of\nsurrendering themselves to apathy\na young group of Imperial students\nhave built a campaign from nothing,\nit\u2019s very impressive and has certainly\ninspired me.\u201d\nSyria Item\u2019s Collect\nSuggested Items:\nMOST REQUIRED MEDICINE:\nGenerally any over the counter but\nalso Antibiotics, Insulin, Amlodipine,\nAtenolol, Ibuprofen, Colic remedy,\nParacetamol, First Aid Packs.\nCHILDRENS ITEMS: Baby Food,\nBaby milk (powder), winter clothing\nOTHER ITEMS:\nNEW CLOTHING: Blankets,\nsleeping bags, thermals, trousers,\nsweaters, socks, hijabs, hats, shoes,\ntights\nOLD CLOTHING: will be sold to\ngenerate funds for life saving medicine\nTOILETRIES: Sanitary towels, soap,\nnail clippers, combs, nappies, nappy\ncream, tampons\nFOR CHILDREN: toys, colouring\nbooks, pencils and crayons, children\narabic books, Wellington boots\nPlease make sure items are not\nexpired, clean and in good condition\n(used goods can still be sold to\npurchase life-saving medicine, but\nwe\u2019d prefer if clothing was in good\ncondition).\nNew Financial Worlds\nConference\nM\narch 2011 saw\nImperial College\nFinance Society\nhold their \ufb01rst\never conference\nat the highly impressive Bloomberg\nHeadquarters.

    "content": "26 FRIDAY 15 NOV\nFILM Editor: John Park\nfilm.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nLike Father Like Son\nDirector: Hirokazu Kore-eda\nWriter: Hirokazu Kore-eda\nStarring: Masaharu Fukuyama,\nMachiko Ono, Yoko Maki, Lily\nFranky, Arata Iura\nRuntime: 119 minutes\nFred Fyles\nStar Writer\n\u201cDaddy is not my daddy\u201d\nWhat do you do when the child you\nhave looked after for the last 6 years\nturns out to be someone else\u2019s? This\nis the question faced by Ry\u014dta Nonomiya (Masaharu Fukuyama) in the\nprize-winning Japanese feature Like\nFather, Like Son, which explores issues of family, blood ties, and class\ndynamics in modern day Japan. Ry\u014dta\nis a straight laced architect; a star-achiever, who is ruthlessly competi-tive, pushing his son Keita through\ncram school, piano lessons, and private schooling in an effort to make\nhim more like his old man. Slightly\ndespairing of his wife Midori (Ma-chiko Ono), who has a tendency to\nindulge their son, he nevertheless\nmakes up part of a stable, albeit cold,\nfamily unit - until they get a phone\ncall from their local hospital, and their\nworld changes.\nIt is revealed that Keita is not really\ntheir son; he was swapped with another child at birth, who is now living\nwith a more bohemian family. Both\nfamilies are now faced with a choice:\ndo they exchange the children? Is the\ngenetic link worth more than the six\nyears of energy and affection each\nfamily has placed in their child? While\nthis subject sounds a bit like a Channel 4 documentary, or else some kind\nof awful Western goofball comedy\n(watch this space for the inevitable\nHollywood remake), director Hirokazu Koreeda weaves it into a complex,\nrich, and ultimately rewarding family\ndrama.\nFilmed in a series of long, languid\nshots, accompanied with a barely-there piano score, Koreeda allows the\nnatural tension between the two families shine through effortlessly. Ry\u014dta\nforms the obvious villain of the piece\n- a work-obsessed family man who\nneglects his wife and child; he is so\nused to winning at everything that at\none point he asks how much the other\nfamily would be willing to accept to let\nhim raise both of the children, letting\nhis money do the talking. Snobbery is\na large part of Ry\u014dta\u2019s character, and\nplays a central role in driving forward\nthe story, but ultimately, Ry\u014dta is a\nsympathetic character, burdened with\ntroubles of his own, and enough daddy\nissues to give Freud a field day. Over\nthe course of the film, thanks largely\nto a restrained performance by Fukuyama, we see the character learn to appreciate his family while he still has\ntime. While this moral outcome may\nseem cliche, the perfect pace at which\nthe film moves makes the transition\nseem completely natural.\nWhile child actors can often make\nor break a film, Koreeda has taken a\ncalculated risk that ultimately paid off,\nresulting in believable performances\nfrom the two 6 year olds, who can only\nlook on as their parents argue and they\nare passed from house to house like\ntennis balls. The camerawork allows\nthe audience to become an observer\nembedded within the centre of each\nfamily, observing not only their different dynamics - modern, cold, professional Vs relaxed, friendly, ramshackle\n- but also the subtle features that make\nthe characters seem like more than 2D\ncutouts. One feature in particular that\nstands out is the performance from\nMachiko Ono, who plays the long suffering Midori with a grace and charm\nthat makes her a magnetic presence\non the screen. Ono imbues her character with pathos; subtle changes in\nher facial expression revealing what\nlies between the surface of her perfect life of domesticity. In one scene\nEastern Boys, Robin Campillo\u2019s sophomore effort, is a chameleon of a film,\nthat flits from genre to genre; over its\ntwo hour running time, it skips from\nhome invasion drama, to tender love\nstory, before climaxing in a finale worthy of a Hollywood thriller. Campillo,\nwho both wrote and directed the film,\nhas created a moving portrait of contemporary relationships, that raises\nquestions about modern sexuality and\nattitudes towards immigration.\nBeginning with long, languid shots\nof Paris\u2019 Gare du Nord, the camera\nfollows a group of young Eastern EuBFI.ORG.UK\nEastern Boys\nDirector: Robin Campillo\nWriter: Robin Campillo\nStarring: Olivier Rabourdin, Kirill\nEmelyanov, Danil Vorobyev, Ed\u00e9a\nDarque\nRuntime: 128 minutes\nFred Fyles\nStar Writer\nropean boys as the mingle around the\nstation. Splitting up, coming together\nagain, they weave through the crowds,\nmaking the audience focus on their\nlocation. We begin to notice a well\ndressed businessman, Daniel (Olivier\nRabourdin) whose attention is drawn\nto a handsome youth - Marek, played\nby Kirill Emelyanov. Eventually, Daniel plucks up the courage to say \u2018Bonjour\u2019, and what follows is a stilted conversation in English, in which Daniel\nattempts to solicit Marek. Unable\nto come that day, Daniel arranges to\nmeet Marek tomorrow, but makes the\nmistake of revealing his home address,\nsetting in motion a chain of events beyond his control.\nThe film is split into four clear sec-tions, and as the gang of youths leave\nthe Gare du Nord, the second section\nbegins. Expecting Marek to arrive,\nDaniel is surprised when he opens the\ndoor to find the gang from the station;\nyoung men from all over Eastern Europe - Ukraine, Romania, Azerbaijan\n- they are united under the forceful\nleadership of Boss (Daniil Vorobyev),\na Russian sociopath. Invading Daniel\u2019s\nhome in the banlieue, they entrap him\ninside, and begin to strip the furni-ture, carting it away in a waiting van.\nWhile things don\u2019t break out into outright violence, there is a palpable atmosphere of tension throughout this\nsection. Once they are satisfied with\ntheir haul, they leave Daniel alone in\nhis empty apartment.\nWhile the director could have been\nsatis\ufb01ed with a simple home invasion\nplot, it is at this point that Campillo\ntakes a left turn into a relationship\ndrama; the next day Marek arrives\nto ful\ufb01ll his end of the deal. Daniel\nis surprised to see him again, but\nnevertheless goes through with things,\nand has sex with Marek. As Marek\nkeeps coming back to the apartment, a\nsort of romance develops between the\ntwo characters, although the nature of\nthis relationship is kept ambiguous;\nbeginning as overtly sexual, Daniel\neventually begins to develop paternal\nfeelings towards Marek, trying to\nhelp him assimilate into French\nsociety - Marek is \u2018sans papiers\u2019, an\nundocumented immigrant, trying to\nescape his past. Does Daniel represent\neconomic freedom for Marek? Or is\nthe apartment a place where Marek\ncan \ufb01nd safety, far away from the\nbombs that killed his family during\nthe Chechen War? Campillo keeps\nhis cards close to his chest, presenting\nshe tries to make small talk with her\n\u2018new son\u2019, but finds herself at a loss for\nwords; suddenly trapped within the\nhotel-like home she has helped to cre-ate, she becomes a prisoner in her own\nhouse, guarded by a child she doesn\u2019t\nreally know, and a husband who insists\nthat blood will rule out.\nHowever, despite all its excellent\nfeatures, it feels like something is lack-ing. Like Father, Like Son is supposed\nto be a story about two separate families who are forced to come together,\nand yet for a majority of the film the\naction is centred upon the uptight\nRy\u014dta. We follow his personal journey,\nand explore how the changes have affected him, but the other father gets\nthe relationship in a neutral, non-judgemental way, and allowing the\naudience to make up their own minds.\nWhile depictions of Paris in cinema\ntends to veer towards the nauseatingly\nromantic - look to Woody Allen\u2019s\ncheesefest Midnight in Paris - this\n\ufb01lm instead follows the path forged by\nthe 1995 masterpiece La Haine, which\ndocumented the grimy underbelly of\nthe Parisian suburbs. With e\ufb00ortlessly\nnaturalistic performances from the\ntwo leads, Eastern Boys isn\u2019t afraid to\nexplore thorny issues of contemporary\nFrench life. Immigration issues are an\nobvious theme, and the \ufb01lm highlights\nboth the issues migrants face when\ncoming to the country, and how they\nare seen as no-one\u2019s responsibility.\nThe gang are holed up in a Premier\nInn like hotel; it is clear that the hotel\nmanager doesn\u2019t want them there, but\nthe rooms are run by social services,\nand there is nothing she can do. It\nseems like a bleak future for these\nmigrants; unable to interact with the\nauthorities, they are instead trapped\nin this nowhere zone on the outskirts\nof Paris; it is no surprise that they\nresort to crime - what else is there to\ndo?\nAn unexpected \ufb01nd at the London\nlittle more than a supporting role. The\nother family is largely glossed over, in\nfavour of the man who clearly needs\nto spend a little bit more time with his\nkid. It seems that the story would be\neven more rewarding if we could explore it from all aspects, as opposed\nfrom a single angle. Nevertheless, Koreeda has followed hot on the heels of\nlast year\u2019s wonderful I Wish with another exceptional family drama that\nmanages to tug at the heartstrings\nwithout ever seeming overwrought;\nLike Father, Like Son, manages to paint\na portrait of modern Japanese life in\nsmall, subtle brushstrokes. A sharply\ncrafted, beautiful film, magnificence\nin miniature\nFilm Festival, Eastern Boys is a \ufb01lm that\nmanages to be both visually sublime,\nand incredibly engaging. There is great\nclarity of vision from the director, who\nteases out superb performances from\nthe cast, but the true star of the \ufb01lm is\nthe script, written by Campillo, which\nmanages the numerous twists and\nturns with nuance and skill, resulting\nin a thought-provoking meditation on\nlove, loss, solitude, and trust.\nBFI.ORG.UK\n\n"

    "content": "15\n@feliximperial\nFelixImperial\nFRIDAY 15 NOV\nARTS\nThe Magic Flute needs a fairy godmother\nEmiel De Lange is unimpressed by the ENO\u02bcs theatrical wizardry\nI\nn this fairy tale, Prince Tamino\nis sent to rescue his love Pamina,\ndaughter of the Queen of the\nNight. When he \ufb01nds and frees\nher, he discovers that her captor,\nSarastro, is actually the good guy and\ndecides to be initiated into his order.\nMeanwhile Tamino\u2019s companion,\nthe bird-catcher Papageno, has given\nup on initiation and simply wants\nsomeone to love. The power of music;\nthe magic \ufb02ute and the enchanting\nbells, helps them both to succeed.\n\u2018Magic\u2019 is the key word in Mozart\u2019s\nMagic Flute, and without it the plot\nmakes little sense. But magic is what\nis missing in this otherwise exciting\nproduction. Instead, we are treated\nto a di\ufb00erent sort of magic \u2013 that of\nstage-craft. Simon McBurney has\nchosen to present his Magic Flute\nin black and white; a dark space, the\naction lit with bright white lights.\nEveryone is dressed in similarly bland\ncolours with the occasional dull green\nor brown thrown in. Indeed, the only\ntwo characters of any colour at all,\nand only two with which we establish\na real connection, are Papageno and\nPapagena. The rest come across as\nlifeless, and so despite their trials, by\nthe end one hardly feels as if anything\nhas happened at all.\nThe \ufb01rst act seems to set up a\ndichotomy between the irrational,\nmagical world of the night, and\nWhat: The Magic Flute with English\nNational Opera\nWhere: London Coliseum, WC2\nWhen: Until 7 Dec 2013\nPrice: Various\nSarastro\u2019s rational world of knowledge\ninhabited by men and women in suits.\nIt\u2019s ambiguous which of the two worlds\nwe should prefer, and disappointingly\nthe idea seems to disappear without\nany synthesis or resolution. Many\nsuch interesting ideas are thrown\nabout without developing or cohering.\nAgain, by the end one wonders\nwhether anything has happened at all.\nThe orchestra plays very well under\nyoung conductor Gergely Madaras, if\na little monochromatic \u2013 but I suppose\nthis is a theme here. The singers too\nseem restrained and underwhelming,\nparticularly G\u00f6tz\u2019s Queen of the Night\nwhose entrance is a whimper and\nwhose famous coloratura leaps are a\nlittle shaky. Again only the Papageno\npair really characterise their parts\nand leave us with an impression of\nhumanity, while Creswell\u2019s Sarastro\nis full and imposing and Galliford\u2019s\nMonostatos is amusingly creepy.\nMcBurney\u2019s theatrical displays are\nenough to provide a full evening\u2019s\nentertainment. I won\u2019t give away\nhis tricks, but there are a few grand\nmoments of illusion in a generally\nimpressive and unique staging. Clever\nuse is made of video projections which\nblend onto the set and interact with\nthe characters. Another nice touch\nis the use of a live Foley to create the\nsound e\ufb00ects, even if the presence on\nstage is distracting and unnecessary \u2013\na gimmick perhaps. There is humour\ntoo in this production, particularly\nwhen the fourth wall is broken, and\nthe interactions with the orchestra are\nworth a chuckle.\nAs fantastic and entertaining as\nthe performance may be, in the end\nwe leave the theatre left with little.\nThe amusement and wizardry on\ndisplay are not enough, perhaps even\ndetrimental, to a real experience of\nSchikaneder and Mozart\u2019s rich cast\nof characters, magic and music.\nThe admittedly frequent theatrical\nspectacles are bright sparks but the\ntinder doesn\u2019t succeed in catching \ufb01re.\n\u00a9 ROBBIE JACK\nPapageno and Papagena, played by Ben Johnson and Devon Guthrie, swirling around on stage\nAngolan Civil War makes powerful subject matter\nPlay at the new Park Theatre is breathtaking, says Blaise Verhasselt\nS\nouth Africa, 1989, and Josh\nGilmore is poised to become\nthe first white man to break\nthe 10-second barrier for the\n100m, and be made a hero\nby the racist regime. He is\nconscripted while the South African\nDefence Force is taking an unofficial\npart in the Angolan Civil War, under\nthe command of Captain Papa Louw.\nThis is Angola. One wrong turn and\nyou vanish forever, my brother.\nThey capture a wounded and\nsomewhat distinguished black\nfreedom fighter, and Papa orders\nJosh to carry him back to the border\nto be interrogated. But as they\npainfully make their way through the\nbush, a bond is forged between the\nconscripted soldier and the prisoner,\nthat will forever change Josh\u2019s views\non his society.\nThe Dead Wait is written by and\nstars Paul Herzberg (Papa Louw),\nwho served in the South African\narmy in Angola himself. Through\nthis breath-taking play, Herzberg\nreveals the struggles faced by a\ndivided continent, finding himself a\nfew years before the end of both the\nApartheid and the Cold War. The\nplay is focused on three characters\nincarnating opposed concepts, on\nthe eve of a major historical leap:\nPapa Louw, the aging, cultivated\nbut impulsive officer, incarnates the\nwhite racist, brutal and traumatised\nauthority, hardly ruling South\nAfrica with a minority under the\nApartheid. He will have to face the\ntruth commission in the 1990s.\nGeorge Jozana (Maynard Eziashi),\naging African National Congress\nleader in exile in Europe for many\nyears, comes back to Africa with\nthe hope that his homeland will\nsoon recover peace, freedom\nand democracy. Josh Gilmore\n(Austin Hardiman), the white\nathlete, caries the hopes of his\ncountry\u2019s government. As the\nnew generation, he is also able to\nincarnate reconciliation between his\ncountrymen.\nThe interactions of this trio are\nextremely rich and well exploited\nby Herzberg, whilst the intimate\nstage of the Park Theatre brings\nall the audience in an astonishing\nexperience under Joe Harmston\u2019s\ndirection. Clearly, The Dead Wait\nis an excellent play to go to with\nfriends in London\u2019s newest, hippest\narts venue. The only drawback is\nthe theatre\u2019s location, slightly north\nof the West End. But surely Zone 2\nis not enough to discourage drama\namateurs! To them, I say it\u2019s a very\ngood play, with excellent actors and\nan interesting historical basis: you\nshould go!\nWhat: The Dead Wait\nWhere: The Park Theatre, Finsbury\nPark, N4\nWhen: Until 1st Dec 2013\nPrice: \u00a312 students, \u00a318 adults\nMBA LITERARY SCRIPT AGENTS\n\n"

If you or your partner have had too\nmuch to drink or have taken drugs, it can lead you\nto make bad decisions or do things you wouldn\u2019t do\nsober. Better to wait until you\u2019ve sobered up.\nCONSENSUAL \u2013 it is crucial that you and your partner consent to all sexual\nactivities. Some points to note:\n- Consenting to one sexual activity does not mean your partner consents to all\nsexual activities e.g. just because someone is okay with kissing, it does not mean\nthey are okay with sex.\n- Unconscious people e.g. people who are asleep/passed out, cannot give consent.\n- Alcohol can remove someone\u2019s ability to consent if they are too drunk. It is\ndifficult to tell sometimes how drunk is too drunk to consent, but checking in with\nyour partner and ensuring they are continuously, enthusiastically consenting to\nwhatever you\u2019re doing is a good way of \ufb01nding out. If someone is slurring their\nspeech, or is falling asleep or otherwise seems physically impaired by their\nalcohol consumption, then clearly they aren\u2019t able to consent. If in doubt, don\u2019t\ndo anything!\n-Ifyou\u2019reengaginginanysituationwhereitcouldbedifficulttotellifyourpartner\nis consenting e.g. during roleplay, it\u2019s a good idea to have a safe word (something\nyou would never normally say during sex) or a safe action (e.g. dropping weights)\n- Enthusiastic consent is sexy \u2013 if you think it sounds boring, you\u2019re doing\nsomething wrong. Some examples of enthusiastic consent if you need inspiration\n\u2013 \u2018Do you like that?\u2019, \u2018I want to (use your imagination)\u2019, \u2018Yes! Yes! Yes!\u2019\nSAFE SEX\nCondoms and dental dams are fundamentally\nimportant when practicing safe sex. However, they\nare also expensive and have the habit of running out\nor being misplaced at the worst possible moment.\nThat\u2019s why it\u2019s important that they are available\nshould you need them and it\u2019s never a bad idea to\npick some up if you\u2019re running low at home. Around\ncampus there are a few places you can get condoms:\n- SAC Reception (Level 2M of the Union Building) \u2013\nthere is a pot of condoms on the reception desk that\nyou can help yourself to.\n- Imperial College Health Centre, located underneath\nSouthside Halls in Prince\u2019s Gardens.\n- Behind the bars \u2013 from now on, you can ask the\nUnion\u2019s bar staff for packs of condoms.\n- In halls \u2013 if you\u2019re in a hall of residence, you should\nhave condom reps who will be supplied with\ncondoms \u2013 check the A-Z on our website to \ufb01nd out\nwho your rep is.\n- STI Clinics \u2013 you are also able to pick up condoms\nwhen you attend one of the free sexual health clinics\nrun by the Terrence Higgins Trust at the Union.\nDue to the relative demand and expense of dental\ndams and pregnancy tests, they aren\u2019t distributed\nin the same ways as condoms, but they should be\navailable from the Union reception on request. If\nyou\u2019re in need of a dental dam, you can cut and\nuse a condom instead, but just make sure it doesn\u2019t\ncome with spermicide and is either unlubricated or\nflavoured as common lubricants used in condom\npacks don\u2019t always taste nice.\nWhen used correctly, male condoms are 98%\neffective. Here are some top tips for condom usage:\n- Make sure your condoms have a CE mark \u2013 this\nmeansthey\u2019vebeentestedandaresafetouse.Novelty\ncondoms, fake condoms or condoms\nthat are handed out in promotions may\nnot have this so it\u2019s worth checking\n- Make sure your condoms are in date \u2013\nalthough it can be a little disheartening\nto realise your condoms have had time\nto expire since you bought them all of\nthose years ago, that beats the panic of\na condom splitting.\n- Don\u2019t use condoms that look squashed\nor faded \u2013 in a similar vein to the above\npoint, this can happen if you keep\ncondoms in your wallet or purse for\na long time. It can mean the condom\ninside is damaged so it\u2019s better to use a\nfresh one.\n- Never use two condoms together \u2013\nalthough this tactic is commendable\nin terms of commitment to safety, it\nactually has the opposite effect as the\nfriction between the two condoms\nmakes them more likely to split. This\nincludes using two male condoms\n(\u2018double-bagging\u2019) and using a male and\nfemale condom together.\n- Using lubricant is a great idea but make\nsure it\u2019s water-based \u2013 using oil-based\nlubricants or things like body lotions,\nolive oil, moisturiser, etc. with latex\ncondoms can make them more likely to\nsplit.\n- Condoms also aren\u2019t just for safe\nvaginal/anal sex, you can (and should!)\nuse them for oral sex too \u2013 many STIs\ncan be transferred through oral sex.\nCommonly these are gonorrhoea,\ngenital herpes and syphilis, but you can\nalso catch chlamydia, HIV, hepatitis,\ngenital warts and (charmingly) pubic\nlice. To stay safe, use condoms for a male\npartner or dental dams/cut condoms for\nfemale partners.\n- Finally, make sure you don\u2019t leave it up\nto a partner to provide condoms \u2013 you\nare both equally responsible!\nCondoms and other barrier methods\nare the best way of protecting against\nSTIs but, to protect against pregnancy,\ncontraception is an extra level of\nsecurity for a lot of women. Make sure\nyou make an appointment at the Health\nCentre or with your GP to explore your\noptions,evenifyoumaynotbecurrently\nsexually active.\n\n"

This is\nthe result of a cleaning review carried\nour by College\u2019s Campus Services\ndepartment, the department that in is\ncharge of Accommodation, Catering,\nConferences and Events, Sport and\nthe Student Hub. Over the Summer\nCollege re-tendered their cleaning\ncontract, resulting in changes to the\nprovision of cleaning services around\nCollege.\nOne of the issues faced by students\na\ufb00ected by the changes was the\npoor dissemination of information,\nmany students failed to understand\nthe change in circumstances or the\noptions they had available to them as a\nresult. This included the availability of\ncleaning equipment for student use in\nhalls, and why the changes were made\nin the \ufb01rst place.\nWhen Felix approached Campus\nServices several weeks ago about the\nchanges to the provision of cleaning\nin halls, they provided the following\nresponse:\n\u201cCollege has recently reviewed its\ncleaning services, as the last review\nwas over seven years ago. It made\nsome changes to ensure the cleaning\nrotas address needs across the\ncampuses.\nThese include the following within\nthe areas of Campus Services\n-Student feedback over the past few\nyears has suggested a need for Halls\nto be cleaned on weekends, to tackle\nany mess created on Friday evenings.\nSaturday cleaning has now been\nintroduced as part of the rota changes.\n-A signi\ufb01cant proportion of students\npreferred not to be disturbed by the\nfortnightly cleaning scheduled on the\nprevious rota. This has now changed\nfrom fortnightly to a monthly, deeper\nclean. General cleaning equipment\nincluding vacuum cleaners will be\nprovided.\n-Cleaning service levels are not\none of the factors considered when\ncalculating student rents. Campus\nServices are contacting all students\nresident in Halls to ensure they are\naware of the changes, and to provide\ndetails of who to speak to if they have\nany concerns\nUpdating the approach to cleaning\nmeans that other facilities can also\nbe serviced more regularly or at more\nuseful points in the day. These include\nEthos, which can be used heavily in\nthe evenings, and the Library Caf\u00e9\nwhich is often used throughout the\nnight by students, together with other\nstudent facilities in Sher\ufb01eld.\nAll of the changes will be monitored\nclosely and kept under review, and\nany students who encounter any\ndi\ufb03culties due to the new rota can\nshare these with their hall supervisor.\nCampus Services have kept the\nUnion\u2019s Deputy President (Finance\nand Services) up-to-date on the\nplanned changes.\u201d\nAside from the issues surrounding\nthe frequency of the cleaning\nservice, several students and sub-Exploring the secret\ntheatre 14\nCollisions Unbound\nThe Science section on CERN\n8\nScience Challenge\nWe interview Dr Jad\nMarrouche\n35\n?\ncontinued on page 3...\n\n"

    "content": "33\n@feliximperial\nFelixImperial\nFRIDAY 15 NOV\nCAREERS\nApply yourself\nT\nhe autumn term is a very\nbusy time. There is the\nnew academic year to\ncontend with and for many\nof you, it is also time to\nconsidering your options. Options for\nhow to spend your summer gaining\nvaluable work related experience,\ncarrying out an internship, options\non course related placements and for\nthe \ufb01nalists among you, options on\nwhere your career will take you after\nyou have \ufb01nished those \ufb01nals and the\ncelebrations have subsided.\nIn a previous article we have\ndiscussed what to consider if you are\nintending to apply for further study\nso this week we will focus on the\napplication process for the world of\nwork and give you some pointers to\nhelp you succeed.\nFirstly it is important to be aware\nof the tight deadlines that are in place\nfor the vast majority of the larger\nopportunity providers. There is a set\ncycle of recruitment that exists and\nyou need to be aware of key dates and\nmilestones. If you miss crucial closing\ndates now you may be putting yourself\nout of the race for the current round of\nrecruitment for this year. These dates\nare important for both graduate roles\nas well as summer internships.\nBroadly speaking recruitment\nfor opportunities, whether they are\nplacements, internships or graduate\nroles are open now and a few\nhave already closed. On the whole\napplications open early in the autumn\nterm and close as we move toward the\nend of November and into December.\nThere are of course exceptions and\nwhat organisation A does in terms\nof recruitment may not be exactly\nthe same as organisation B. Seeking\nout opportunities is obviously very\nimportant but you should also ensure\nthat you take ownership of the process\nand are aware of the deadlines. If you\nare considering options with a small to\nmedium enterprise (SME) these may\nhave an \u2018as required\u2019 policy and may\nnot follow the same cycle as larger\norganisations. We wrote about these\ntypes of organisations in last week\u2019s\nFelix and you should not discount\nSMEs as part of your job hunting\nstrategy.\nNo matter what size of organisation\nand in whatever sector you will still\nneed to apply. The application stage\nis the most critical of the process\nand this is where the vast majority\nof applicants fall down. Time spent\nat this stage of the process is time\nwell spent as once you are shortlisted\nand move through to interviews and\nassessment centres your chances\nof success increase. At the initial\napplication stage there will be many\nmore applicants for the numbers of\nvacancies that exist and employers will\nuse the application stage to quickly\nsift out the candidates that they do\nnot wish to pursue. Whether your\napplication consists of a CV and cover\nletter or online application questions\nyou should adhere to the following\nprinciples to maximise your chances\nof success.\n1 Think like an employer.\nRecruitment is an expensive process\nand employers want to ensure they\nselect the best candidates for the\nadvertised role. Before you start\napplying you should carefully read\nthe job advert and description and\naccompanying person speci\ufb01cation\nif there is one. The Person Spec.\noutlines the skills and attributes that\nthe employer has in mind for the\nideal person for the role, itemised and\npresented in paper. Make sure that\nyou meet all the essential criteria and\neducation required for the role. If you\ndon\u2019t, you will be sifted out at the \ufb01rst\nhurdle. You should also read all the\nother information in the advert fully.\nThere can be subtle hints about the\ntype of person that they are looking\nfor. Do they mention working away\nfrom home? This could indicate they\nneed \ufb02exibility. Do they mention that\nthey require pro-active people? This\ncould indicate they need a person\nwith a \u2018can do\u2019 approach who seeks\nsolutions when required. These are\njust a couple of examples however. If\nyou go back and re read the vacancies\nyou are interested in have you actually\nstarted to gain a clear picture in your\nmind of the person required? You may\nwant to jot down these key points\nafter deconstructing an advert and\nuse them as a point of reference as you\ncraft a strong application.\n2 If the application is on line \u2013 do\nnot start \ufb01lling in your responses\nin one sitting and hit send. Good\napplications take time and will require\nmore than one draft as you review\nyour responses constantly checking\nback to the actual advert and any\nother information you have gained\nfrom research that you have carried\nout into the organisation. It is good\npractice to download the application\nor complete your responses in a\nWord document so you can write a\nsolid answer. You should also keep\ncopies of your application form and\nthe responses that you sent as these\nwill likely be referred to again in the\ninterview process. It\u2019s a good idea to\nre-read everything that you wrote\nin application before attending an\ninterview.\n3 If you are completing a large\nnumber of applications do not be\ntempted to cut and paste answers\nfrom other forms. Questions may be\nsimilar but won\u2019t be exactly the same.\nFor each application you should be\ntailoring your application for that\norganisation. The reader should think\nthat you only have eyes for them.\nRemember they know the type of\nperson they want \u2013 it\u2019s in their person\nspeci\ufb01cation.\n4 When you are using examples of\nyour suitability try to use examples\nform di\ufb00erent areas of your life.\nCollege, leisure, previous work\nexperience and so on. It makes the\nform far more interesting to the reader\nwho may have read lots of applications\nduring the course of the day.\n5 Get the basics right. Employers\nwill not be impressed with poor\nspelling and grammar. Ensure you\nhave proof read your application or\nCV before sending.\n6 Evidence is the key. Employers are\nlooking for certain skills which you will\nhave noted from your detailed analysis\nof the actual role you are applying for.\nA good way to present your evidence\nis by using the STAR technique:\nS \u2013 Situation = set the scene \u2013\ndescribe the situation?\nT \u2013 Task = what was your role?\nA \u2013 Action = what did you do and\nhow did you do it?\nR \u2013 Result = what was the outcome?\nEnsure that you write so that it\nall hangs together to paint a picture\nof the kind of person you are, what\nyour strengths are and what you like\ndoing. You should also ensure you are\nanswering the question asked and link\nyour answer back to the key skills the\nemployer is looking for. Remember\nto phrase your answers to show what\nyou have contributed or done so avoid\nover use of \u2018we\u2019 in your descriptions\nof activities. Employers often look\nfor evidence of your personal impact\nso make sure when describing a\nsituation you remember to \ufb01nish with\nthe outcomes or bene\ufb01ts from your\nactions.\n7 Become the recruiter. Once\nyou have completed your questions\nor tailored your CV ask yourself\nhonestly, \u201cWould I shortlist me?\u201d\nbased on the evidence provided. If you\nfeel that you have not demonstrated,\nwith evidence, that you are the person\nthey are looking for then you will need\nto rethink your responses or further\nreview your CV\nThis has been a short overview\nand has hopefully got you thinking\npositively about your applications.

    "content": "14 FRIDAY 15 NOV\nARTS Editor: Arianna Sorba\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nSarah Lucas: SITUATION\nstill as controversial as ever\nI\nf we want to see the impact\nthat Sarah Lucas has had on\nthe British art world, we need\ngo no further than the bus stop;\nthis summer, Art Everywhere\ncreated a nationwide exhibition,\ntransforming the posters normally\nseen in bus stops and tube stations\ninto the nation\u2019s favourite works\nof art. One of the 57 pieces chosen\nby the public was Lucas\u2019 1996 work\nSelf Portrait With Fried Eggs. Lucas\nsits legs akimbo, in a pair of blokish\njeans, revelling in her androgyny;\nher de\ufb01ant eyes stare at the lens,\nchallenging the viewer, daring them\nto look at the greasy eggs stuck to\nthe front of her chest. Iconoclastic,\nsubversive, and controversial, it is\none of the best embodiments of\nLucas\u2019 work - a visceral \u2018Fuck You\u2019,\ndelivered with wry humour.\nThis is also one of the images that\ngreets the viewer in the \ufb01rst room\nof the long-awaited retrospective\nof Lucas, currently being held at\nthe Whitechapel Gallery, and is not\nthe only portrait in the collection.\nIn fact, Lucas glares out at us from\nall angles, squatting on a skull in\none image, eating a banana in the\nnext, the whole time never breaking\neye contact. It makes for a very\ndisconcerting experience.\nEducated at Goldsmiths, Lucas \ufb01rst\ncame to prominence during the late\n80s and early 90s, riding the crest of\nthe Young British Artists wave along\nwith Tracey Emin, Rachel Whiteread\nand Damien Hirst. Her sexually\ncharged work, playing on ideas of\nmasculinity and desire, soon became\na key feature in the British art scene.\nThere is no lack of such works in the\nexhibition. With the use of squalid\nlooking food, Lucas implies the\npresence of genitals - two greasy\nSpanish hams, juxtaposed against a\npair of panties and a grey mattress,\nbecome thighs, while elsewhere\na vagina is represented by rotten\n\ufb01sh, pitta bread, and buckets. The\nwork is grimy and confrontational,\nreminiscent of the images of the\ndesolate 90s created by Irvine Welsh\nand Mike Leigh.\nBut it\u2019s not just the female form\nthat Lucas explores; upstairs Lucas\ndeconstructs the male anatomy,\nreplacing penises with marrows,\nmilk bottles, and exploding beer\ncans. It may not be subtle, but the\nwork is e\ufb00ective. Phalluses, blown up\nto gargantuan proportions, subvert\nthe hyper-masculine machismo\nof modern life, and question the\nhomogeneity of the art world.\nThis summer, Lucas had a pair of\nenormous phallic marrows installed\nat Snape Maltings; set against the\ngentle Su\ufb00olk countryside, they\nform a jarring counterpoint to\nthe sensuous curves found in the\nMoore sculpture placed alongside\nit - and this is what Lucas does best:\nconfronts the viewer to question\nwhat gender means in society,\nbending the social norms through\nrelentless iconoclasm.\nAlongside phalluses and meat\nproducts, one of the common themes\nin Lucas\u2019 work is her \u2018Bunnies\u2019\nsculptures - made out of twisted\ntights, \ufb01lled with stu\ufb03ng, they lie,\npassive, over chairs, and draped over\nbreezeblocks. Mimicking female\nlegs, some even complete with tiny\nbroken shoes, they seem sad, even\nsomewhat pathetic; but again these\nact as phallic symbols, and this\ndichotomy of female and male form\nelevates them from mere objet trouve\nto high art. Lucas \ufb01ts into a Freudian\ncanon of female artists - from\nLouise Bourgeois to Yayoi Kusama\n- exploring the male form through\nsymbolism, combining this with\nbleak humour, and an appreciation\nof the humble object that would be\ufb01t\nDuchamp. The theme is developed\nfurther in the upstairs galleries,\nwhere the sculptures have been\nenlarged and recast in bronze. Taking\non new qualities \u2013 from soft to hard,\npuny to strong \u2013 Lucas displays her\ninnate understanding of materials\nand their relation to the work.\nLucas\u2019 work is broad, and this\nretrospective is an intimidating\nexperience. Pieces are piled up\nhaphazardly around the gallery,\npractically over\ufb02owing out into the\nstreet. From smashed up cars to\nrotten \ufb01sh, toilets to tabloids, Lucas\nhas a knack of dissecting society,\nstripping away the bright facade,\nrevealing the dirt and squalor that lies\nunderneath. The work may be hard\nto look at - grotesque even - but that\ndoesn\u2019t diminish their importance.\nThis exhibition shows that Lucas is\ntruly one of the best enfant terribles\nof the British art world, with work\nthat, while never becoming trite,\nremains controversial, visceral, and\nirrepressibly explosive.\nFred Fyles\nWriter\nWhat: Sarah Lucas: SITUATION\nAbsolute Beach Man Rubble\nWhere: Whitechapel Art Gallery, E1\nWhen: Until 15th Dec 1013\nPrice: FREE\n\u00a9 SARAH LUCAS, COURTESY SADIE COLES HQ\nAu Naturel, 1994, made from a mattress, water bucket, melons, oranges and a\ncucumber.\n\u00a9 SARAH LUCAS, COURTESY SADIE COLES HQ\nBunny Gets Snookered #1, 1997, made\nfrom tan tights, plastic and chrome\nchair, steel clamp, kapok stuf\ufb01ng, and\nwire.\nF\nirst, a word of warning. This review is about\na Secret Theatre production. The entire\npremise is that it\u2019s secret. So please bear with\nme: I\u2019m being cryptic for a reason, I\u2019m not\njust trying to be a ponce.\nBefore coming to London, the Secret Theatre\nperformed in New York, where they had been\nasked to produce a theatre adaptation of Edward\nScissorhands, and Los Angeles, where they showed\nThe Dairy of a Sociopathic Freakazoid. Because of\nthe secret nature of their performances they are run\nfor a short time in a single city \u2013 and this time it\u2019s\nLondon\u2019s turn.\nThe Secret Theatre experience differs from most\nother theatrical experiences: you buy your ticket\nwithout even knowing what the performance will\nbe about, other than it\u2019s based on one of Quentin\nTarantino\u2019s great works. Then you get The Email:\nthe dress code, the alias, the location.\nNext, there\u2019s the excitement of turning up in front\nof a warehouse, down a side alley, and hanging\naround trying to work out what\u2019s going on - are\nthose audience or actors? Is this lady being naturally\nfriendly or has the performance already started? It\u2019s\nexciting, it\u2019s different, it\u2019s mysterious.\nHaving keyed up the audience to such a state of\nanticipation, it is a bit of a downer when the play\nturns out to be the traditional set up of audience\nsitting in front of the stage. Throughout the play\nthere\u2019s the feeling you might be called upon at any\ntime, mainly because of the extraordinary proximity\nyou have to the actors. It keeps you on the edge of\nyour seat, but is an aspect of the production that\nnever really develops, and does slightly dampen the\nthrill of the experience.\nSo there you are, sitting in a small room, half a\nmeter from the actors in front of you, as a theatrical\nversion of a Tarantino film unfolds in front of you. If\nyou haven\u2019t already, make sure you\u2019ve seen his most\nwell-known films before going to this, as you will\nlose out if you haven\u2019t.\nMy true praise for the Secret Theatre is not for\ntheir secrecy but for their production levels: the\nstory develops in front of you with a breathtaking\nsense of reality. Half scared, half feeling you should\nintervene, you sit watching violence and pain that\nyou completely believe in. Unlike the cinema, such\nclose proximity theatre dispenses with elaborate\nprops and gushes of fake blood and relies entirely\non the actors\u2019 talents.\nThis production was almost dogmatically faithful\nto the film it was adapting \u2013 some scenes were so\nsimilar that they were word for word reproductions\nof film scenes \u2013 and yet it was fantastic. It was\nfantastic because it made a film come alive under\nyour eyes, at an arm\u2019s reach from you. Whether film\nor theatre, it achieved what all productions try to\nachieve: a sense of reality, of having been there, of it\nactually having happened.\nSecret Theatre London is being performed until\n30th November at a secret London Zone 1 location,\ntickets available at secrettheatrelondon.com for \u00a318.\nClara Clark Nevola\nWriter\nThe Super Secret\nSecret Theatre\nBuy the ticket \u2013 take the ride\nSarah Lucas is a\nBritish artist.

Her\nperformance is a rich, mesmerising\none, and she alone at the core of what\ncan be seen as a modern adaptation\nof A Streetcar Named Desire, equals\nthe gravitas of Vivien Leigh. Rocking\nher Chanel clothes and Louis Vuitton\nbags, Jasmine (Blanchett) struggles\nadjusting to a more grounded life, as\nwell as holding on to her own sanity.\nJudi Dench (Philomena)\nThe most heartbreaking yet uplifting\nfilm of the year is Stephen Frear\u2019s lat-est, starring Britain\u2019s very own Dame\nJudi Dench who gives a performance\nso nuanced and effective that it will be\ndifficult not to be moved to tears by\nthe end of it all. Forced to give her son\nup for adoption by mean nuns who\nuse religion as an excuse for all their\nwrongdoings, Philomena Lee (Dench)\nis on a 50-year mission to find her\nchild. Teamed up with a journalist,\nher journey takes them to America of\nall places where surprising facts await.\nDench is simply superb in every way.\nEmma Thompson (Saving Mr Banks)\nIn playing P. L. Travers, the author of\nMary Poppins who had a notoriously\ndifficult relationship with Walt Disney\nand his company, Emma Thompson\nis simply magical. As a middle-aged\nEnglish woman (which in Hollywood\nmeans she\u2019s an up-tight, bossy buzz-kill who needs a sprinkle of the Yankee\nmagic to start having some fun in life),\nshe\u2019s a comic delight as she clashes\nwith the production of the film Mary\nPoppins, but she has a more moving\nbackground story to tell, relating to\nher childhood and her sweet relationship with her father.\nMeryl Streep (August: Osage County)\nHardly a year goes by without the\nmention of Meryl Streep\u2019s name during the awards season. But there is of\ncourse every reason to be in awe of\nthe most versatile, most talented actress the screen has ever seen. With\n17 nominations and 3 wins under her\nbelt, she\u2019s the most nominated actress\nof all time, and is one win short of becoming the actress with most wins.\nAs the matriarch of the Weston fam-ily, Violet (Streep) has to deal not only\nwith her husband\u2019s suicide, but also\nher alcoholism, as well as having her\nentire family back under one roof.\nDecember is just around the corner,\nand \ufb01lm studios are lining up their\ncritically-lauded \ufb01lms to take part in\nthis year\u2019s much-anticipated Oscar\nrace. As with any year, there are strong\ncontenders in every \ufb01eld and it\u2019s\ncertainly too early to be betting on a\nwinner.\nSo over the next few weeks, Felix\nFilm will be giving you a breakdown of\nthe actors, actresses and \ufb01lms that will\nbe grabbing the headlines in the near\nfuture; but this is in no way a de\ufb01nitive\nlist, as some of the \ufb01lms haven\u2019t even\nbeen released over here yet.\nThis week in our feature is the hotly\ncontested Best Lead Actress category.\nReady...\nSteady...\nGo!\n2014 at the Oscars:\n\n"

The drummer was\na great addition, bringing to life the\nthumping beats striking their way\nthrough tracks such as \u201cFantasy\u201d a\npounding and dramatic pop song, and\n\u201cBones\u201d the epitome of their darker,\ngothic side.\nJust as large was vocalist Lizzy\nPaplinger\u2019s beautiful voice. She hit all\nthe notes as perfect as those on the\nalbum and perhaps went even further.\nShe sung the way that you could tell\nher hand had crafted all the lyrics.\nIt was disappointing, however, that\nsome of the synth couldn\u2019t replaced\nwith more live instruments which\nwould have given the set more variety\ncompared to the studio versions.\nDespite the limited number of\nsongs form one album, an injection\nof Arctic Monkeys\u2019 \u201cDo I Wanna\nKnow \u201cwas a stunning cover. Turning\nit into a Ms Mr ballad, it sounded like\nit could have been a beautiful original\nwere it not for obviously British lyrics\nsuch as \u201csummat\u201d and \u201csettee\u201d.\nOne of my favourite parts about\nthe show had to be Paplinger\u2019s\nmulticoloured hair which glowed\ngreen under darkness as though\nit were covered all over in green\n\ufb02uorescent protein.\nIt was also sweet to see Paplinger\nherself glowing with glee at the\nthought of playing Shepherd\u2019s Bush\nEmpire. She could not stop smiling\nall the way through, even as she\nbellowed her biggest notes. When the\naudience joined in for favourites, and\nespecially their \ufb01nal song Hurricane,\nN\nEmiel\u02bcs Guide to\nAsk someone to\nname a \u2018Classical\u2019\ncomposer and\nthey\u2019ll reply with\nBach, Mozart or\nBeethoven. The\nmusic we\u2019ve discussed so far is,\nI\u2019ll admit, a little\nbit \u2018niche\u2019; rarely\nperformed in the\nconcert hall, and\nprobably the reserve of a special\ngroup of early\nmusic enthusi-asts. Still, I\u2019m\ngoing to continue my slow march\nthrough history \u2013 not only because\nthe foundations of music are being\nlaid, but also because you may actually like some of what you hear!\nI certainly do; the music of these\nearly periods has a certain purity,\n(to modern ears) and mysticism to\nit not seen again until the 20th cen-tury. So, I hope you keep reading,\nand once again there should be musical examples on the Felix website\nto give you a taste.\nAs I mentioned two weeks ago,\nthe Abbess Hildegard von Bingen\nis often considered the first real\nmusical artist. From a young age she\nexperienced visions, and eventually\nbecame Abbess of a convent in the\nRhine valley. Her music was unique\nfor its time and reflected her mystical and visionary outlook on life.\nWhile her contemporaries were still\nobsessed with the platonic achievement of a perfect Musica, she wrote\nmusic that is poetic and emotive.\nThis effect was created through ir-regularity, both in the music and\ntext; her verses only pair loosely,\nsuggesting variation rather than\nrepetition, while the words rarely\nrhyme and are irregularly accented.\nThe musical line too roams over an\nunprecedented range of notes and\nis hard to pin down into a precise\nmode. She called her music a \u201csymphony of the harmony of heavenly\nrevelations\u201d.\nThrough the 12th Century, music\nmade massive leaps as a result of\never clearer notation. Academic\ncathedral schools began to flourish\nand musicians began to write music of increasing complexity. Prime\namong these was the cathedral of\nNotre Dame in Paris, which would\ndominate the musical world for the\nnext 100 years.\nOne of the great innovations here\nwas polyphony, music written with\nmultiple independent lines. Polyphony has likely always been in use,\nand in the 12th Century it was often used as an improvisation on the\nwritten monophonic line. Yet at Notre Dame it became an art in itself\nand was notated. Polyphony almost\nbecame synonymous with composi-tion. The first polyphonic compositions were simple drone notes, with\nanother line playing on top of it, or\ntwo lines moving parallel at the interval of a fifth. However, the need\nfor \u2019occursus\u2019, or for the two notes\nto meet together at the end necessitates that they move in a non-parallel fashion! When two lines\nmove in such a way, different intervals will exist between them, some\ndissonant and some consonant.\nHence, the art of polyphony lies in\nhow to manage these intervals so\nthat they can move independently\nand still create a harmonic \u2018whole\u2019.\nOur friend Guido of Arezzo wrote\nthe first treatise on polyphony and\ndemonstrated multiple \u2018solutions\u2019,\nleaving the choice up to the com-poser; this marked an important\nshift in attitude towards music as a\ncreative art.\nMost of what we know from the\nNotre Dame school comes from an\nanonymous source. It seems the two\ngreatest composers were L\u00e9onin\n(1150s \u2013 1201) and Perotin (fl. C.\n1200), both known as \u2018Magistra\u2019,\nor masters. From Perotin, we have\nthe first surviving piece with 4-part\npolyphony, but both made massive\nadvances in our understanding of\nrhythm and harmony. Perotin often\nmoved to his occursus via the most\ndissonant (or ugly) intervals possible (think back to Pythagoras\u2019s\nfrequency ratios), creating a great\nsense of relief or resolution. This\nharmonic \u2018movement\u2019 would eventually blossom into our current system of tonal harmony. In two weeks\nI will elaborate on my claims about\nrhythm and we will explore the next\ngreat flowering of music, the Ars\nNova, and why Perotin and L\u00e9onin\nbecame known as the Ars Antiqua.\nMs Mr at the Shepherd\u2019s Bush Empire\nEmiel de Lange\nEpisode 3: The School at Notre Dame\nIn other news...\nMcFly and Busted are to form a \u02bbsuper\u02bcgroup\nfor a series of arena tours in 2014.

Only 15min away\nby overground from Paddington, and\non a purpose built mile long racetrack\nwith no cars or pedestrians to contend\nwith. The atmosphere was light-heart-ed as fourteen of Imperial Triathlon\nClub\u2019s \ufb01nest gathered outside the\nfront of Hillingdon triathlete\u2019s club\nhouse. The atmosphere inside was just\nas relaxed as the hosts seamlessly ran\na faultless race day for us.\nThe day\u2019s events were split in two,\nwith the women\u2019s category heading\nout \ufb01rst, and the men\u2019s category an\nhour later. This suited me just \ufb01ne, as\nit would let the girls dry up the track\na little for us from last night\u2019s rain!\nThe gun was shot and brandishing the\nnew TriIC trisuit, Sophie Kirk quickly\npulled out an early lead, with Ellie\nHoward only a few places behind. By\nthe end of the \ufb01rst mile, sports scholar\nand running guru Sophie had pulled\nan unprecedented \ufb01fteen second lead\non second place. The pack was however full of strong runners, meaning\nFran, Sian and Ellie had to work hard\nto cling to the front contingency before transition.\nA hasty change of shoes, donning\nof helmets and awkward running in\ncycling cleats saw the girls exit transition and on to the ten mile bike time\ntrial. The TriIC women\u2019s team had set\nthe pace for the race leaders during\nthe run with Fran exiting transition in\n10th, Sian in 11th and Ellie Howard in\n8th. The cycle obviously suited Fran\nCapel as she put in the second fastest\nbike time of the day, only losing out to\nour own Sophie Kirk who was beginning to worry the boys in support.\n\u201c37 second lead Sophie, slow down!\u201d\nas she raced by only three miles into\nthe course. Team newbies Victoria Kemp and Olivia Bentley looked\nstrong throughout the course, continuing to overtake the opposition to\nloud and audacious encouragement\nfrom the boys. Before we knew it Sophie was out on the \ufb01nal run and nearing the \ufb01nish line. Despite a desperate\nsprint to get there to cheer her on, she\nbeat the boys to the \ufb01nish to announce\na 1st place smashing of the opposi-tion, \ufb01nishing nearly three minutes\nahead of second place in the women\nseniors\u2019 category. Notable \ufb01nishers include another podium position from\nFran in 3rd place, and Sian Morgan\nand Ellie Howard clocking 6th and 7th\nrespectively. The sterling e\ufb00ort from\nSophie did not go unnoticed, as Sky\nEd Hallett gives his account as Imperial take both first and third place.\nSports HD came over for a 5-minute\ninterview.\nThe men\u2019s race saw the sun rise\nhigher and the temperatures become\nmore bearable. With extremely high\nrunning standards, the leaders left\nthe main pack for dust with Michael\nKaye and Charlie Houston representing TriIC at the front, before a strong\nbike leg saw Ed Hallett claw back to a\ncontending position. The track was\nsmooth and warmed by the sun, giving\nthe cyclists room to breathe as they\nnegotiated the sharp hairpin bends\nof the course. With only a few very\nshort hills to wake the legs up, a relatively \ufb02at course lends itself to a fast\naverage pace. With a few laps to go of\nthe cycle Ed Hallett overtook Michael\nKaye in a \ufb01erce internal battle. The\nvictor between the two gets to present\nthe other with a second place medal\nwhich they have to wear for the next\nrace. If the previous loser then wins,\nthey get to pass on the second place\nmedal of shame with as much gloating\nand abuse as deserved! A committed\ne\ufb00ort from Mike to try and keep up\nwith Ed on the bike was in vain, and\nMike had to watch as he disappeared\nout of sight.\nNewbie Daniel Tyrie rocked a superb \ufb01rst duathlon e\ufb00ort \ufb01nishing\n18th over all. Ed Hallett managed to\nmaintain his lead from the bike to \ufb01nish 13th despite Mike completing the\nsecond running leg a minute faster.\nMike eventually crossed the line in\n15th. Our top male \ufb01nisher however,\nwith a superb second run was Charlie\nHouston, \ufb01nishing 5th, just missing\nout on a podium position!\nWith sweat evaporating and legs\nwobbling we herded into the warmth\nof the club house and tucked into recovery drinks and banana cake, which\nwas more like soft banana brownie:\nit was epic! So with Fran and Sophie\ncarrying their alcoholic prizes back to\ntheir car, a contingency climbed on to\ntheir bikes and enjoyed a cycle home\nin the bright morning sun.\nThank you to our sponsors Jaguar\nLand Rover for their continued support and the new racing kit!\nIC Triathlon is sponsored by:\nIC TRIATHLON\nIC 3s take care of\nbusiness against LSA\nJulian Iacoponi\n3rd XI Football Player\nO\nn the 6th of\nNovember \u2013 a\nsinisterly drab\nWednesday (the\nkind that taunts\nat the beginning of a cold, dark\nwinter) \u2013 ICUAFC 3rd Team\nplayed against LCA Business\nSchool 1st Team. The 5-0 score-line showed the match to be\n(ironically) not just business as\nusual for the opposition, and\nindeed the same was true of both\nteams\u2019 journeys to the match.\nWhilst initial good\nnews of the \ufb01xture\u2019s relocation\nto IC home ground Harlington\ndue to plague-like \ufb02oods at the\nopposition\u2019s pitches, the true tone\nwas soon set as it became apparent\nthat \u2018Little\u2019 Harlington \u2013 the bitter,\nbesmirched and forgotten little\nbrother to the main Harlington\ncomplex \u2013 was to be our allocated\nchanging room.\nThe public transport over\nto Harlington was dominated by\ncharacteristically uncharismatic 3s\nsilence, when it became chillingly\napparent that there was something\no\ufb00 about the normal bus route\nto the grounds\u2026 a diversion. A\ngruesome tra\ufb03c incident right\noutside the desired Harlington\nbus stop had left the 3s stranded,\nup the creek without a paddle\u2026\nLuckily, a paddle wasn\u2019t quite\nneeded, though with the blustering\nwind a sail could have helped. Not\nso luckily however, it left the 3s\nwith one last resort: to yomp it\nall the way to the grounds. There\nreally was nothing fun about this\ndiversion.\nHalf an hour later \u2013\nover 2 miles traversed, endless\nleafy puddles avoided, and even\nan idea for a new pub-crawl\nhatched (#Harling10) \u2013 we made\nit! However, this was only to \ufb01nd\nthe opposition to be struggling\nyet more with the delays\u2026 This\nheathen trot to Harlington will\nnever be forgotten \u2013 it\u2019s minibuses\nall the way for 3s now (not actually\ntrue, but it should be)!.\nWhen the football \ufb01nally arrived,\nthe referee unfortunately had not.\nDespite beginning the match\nwith an LCA player as the o\ufb03cial\nhowever, the 3s had a quick start,\ntaking advantage of the extra pre-match warm-up time. Francis\nNwobu and Tyrone Scille hassled\nthe LCA back four relentlessly,\nuntil an early reward came as great\ninterplay between the front 2 lead\nto a sweet \ufb01nish from Tyrone. A\nsimilar move soon after led to an\neven sweeter Henry-esque \ufb01nish\ninto the top corner from the inform striker. With the referee being\nkind enough to join for the last\n15 minutes of the half, it was 2-0\nIC 3s, and despite some sloppily\nsquandered chances to get that\nkiller third goal, the team began to\ntake full control of the match, with\ncentre-backs Jack \u2018The Fresher\u2019\nPeacock (a.k.a Club Historian) and\nVincent Avena imposing their will\nin defence.\nThe second half began worse for\nthe 3s, with some careless passes\nleading to uncomfortable spells of\npressure in the IC half. LCA\u2019s best\nplayer,anall-controllingYayaToure\ntype, was starting to in\ufb02uence\nthe game more and more. Sanjiv\nDutt stood \ufb01rm in goal, sweeping\naway any half snippets at goal and\norganizing the defence in front of\nhim. But at 2-0, IC were still in an\nuncomfortably vulnerable position.\nAs more chances begged and\npleaded and pled and entreated\nfor the 3s attack, nerves began to\njangle, with the memory of a recent\n2-4 loss \u2013 from 2-0 up \u2013 etched\nall too vividly into the collective\nmemory.\nThen, suddenly, a spark came:\na booming Taha Butt challenge\non the LCA playmaker lead to\nFaidon Mitzalis (a.k.a International\nMan of Mystery, IMoM) nicking\nthe ball round the opposing full-back, which, after a series of slick\nslide-rule passes teasing the LCA\ndefence, led to a clinical drive\ninto the side netting by captain\nMyles Jarvis. That goal was critical\nin cementing con\ufb01dence and\nexpelling those cretins of concern\nthat were creeping into the contest,\nand the 3s began to light up too hot\nand bright for the LCA men. It was\n\ufb01reworks time.\nExtended periods of goal-threatening pressure followed,\nwith the quality in the IC team a\nclass above their LCA counterparts:\nwinning corners, deep throw-ins\n(courtesy of Miles Covers), and\ntesting the keeper at every chance.\nA fourth goal came when one such\ncorner dropped into the 6 yard box\nwhere numerous 3s were waiting.\nA series of half clearances and half\nshots led to the ball ricocheting o\ufb00\nFrancis Nbowu and rippling the side\nnetting, capping o\ufb00 a stellar triple\ngoal-and-assist match.\nThe \ufb01fth and \ufb01nal goal came\ncourtesy of LCA\u2019s goalkeeper: a weak\npass out from a goal-kick to one of\nhis \u2013 now demoralised \u2013 centre-backs was sharply intercepted by\nJulian Iacoponi, who, despite taking\na heavy touch (sending him on a\ndirect crash course with both keeper\nand centre-back) executed step 3\nof those famously infamous Pete\nStillwell instructions \u2013 to WANT\nIT \u2013 and managed to crunch a \ufb01nish\nthrough what was a heavy impact\ncollision.\nSpecial mention goes out to Faidon\nMitzalis who, on one of his frequent\nmazy runs foraying in and around\nthe penalty box, was disgustingly\nskewered by an LCA player, leaving\nour beloved IMoM stuck on the\nsidelines with ankle damage for the\ncoming weeks. #PrayForFaidon!\nPeace out.\nICUAFC is sponsored by:\n\n"

The centre is set to\nbe \u201cone of the most important centres\nfor \ufb01nancial research in the world\u201d\naccording to Mervyn King (former\ngovernor of the Bank of England) and\nwill be based in Imperial\u2019s renowned\nbusiness school.\nProfessor Franklin Allen and\nProfessor Douglas Gale, two of the\nworld\u2019s leading experts on \ufb01nancial\ncrisis and market contagion (The\nspread of economic crisis/boom via\nsmall \ufb01nancial institutions) are set to\nlead the centre, leaving their previous\nposts in the US where they were based\nat top universities. The professors\nhave been hailed as \u201ctwo of the giants\nof modern banking and corporate\n\ufb01nance.\u201d by Kenneth Rogo\ufb00, Professor\nof Economics at Harvard University,\nand Alan Howard, (founder of Brevan\nHoward) an Imperial alumnus, as\nwell as the man behind the donation,\nis hoping that \u201cunder Franklin and\nDouglas\u2019 leadership, the Brevan\nHoward Centre will be perhaps the\nworld\u2019s most important locus for\nstudying these [\ufb01nancial] issues.\u201d\nProfessor Allen himself, has said\nthat Brevan Howard\u2019s donation has\n\u201ccreated the opportunity to set up\na \ufb01nance centre that will be second\nto none in the world.\u201d And together\nwith Professor Gale, he plans \u201cfor\nthe research produced at the Brevan\nHoward Centre to have a direct\nand positive in\ufb02uence on \ufb01nancial\npolicymakers and practitioners.\u201d\nProfessor Gale also added that\n\u201cAlthough the Business School is\nrelatively young, it has made rapid\nprogress and I am con\ufb01dent that it can\nattain the global stature that Imperial\nCollege has in the natural sciences,\nengineering and medicine. Thanks\nto the generosity of Alan Howard in\nfunding the Centre, we have already\ntaken a big step toward that goal.\u201d\nAs you may have deduced by now,\nthis centre will e\ufb00ectively play a part\nin determining the future of both the\nUS and UK economies, and therefore\nit is no surprise that this initiative has\nbeen met with praise from o\ufb03cials\nfrom both sides of the Atlantic.\nFormer US Treasury Secretary Larry\nSummers has made assurances that\nit will \u201cmake our \ufb01nancial system\nwork better and make \ufb01nancial policy\nmuch wiser\u201d. London Mayor Boris\nJohnson hardly seemed to be able to\ncontain his excitement, commenting\nthat: \u201cGreat scholars and thinkers are\nintrinsically linked to the success of\nour city, and having convinced these\ntwo world leading minds to move\nhere will help Imperial College further\ncement London\u2019s position as the\nworld\u2019s intellectual capital.\u201d - Sounds\ngood to us Boris!\nTherefore, not only has Imperial\nonce again asserted its dominance on\nthe world stage of leading institutions,\nthe college has also adopted a hands\non approach to addressing the key\nissues that are confronting society\ntoday. The success of this approach has\nbeen exempli\ufb01ed by the high graduate\nemployment rates that Imperial\nproduces time and time again, and the\nlaunch of the Brevan Howard Centre\nis just another step in cementing\nImperial\u2019s global reputation.\nSeedcamp is known as \u2018the Harvard\nof Startup Accelerators\u2019, and widely\nregarded as the top Accelerator\nin Europe. On top of their regular\nactivities, they also run Seedhack a\nhackathon (where coders, designers\nand other startup-y types get together\nand \u2018hack\u2019 cool products together\nover a weekend). Last weekend was\nSeedhack 4.0, with the theme of\n\u2018remixing content\u2019. They worked to\nget a lot of data providers at the event,\nand we were spoilt for choice! From\nthe BBC\u2019s realtime news data hose,\nthrough to Nokia\u2019s music service and\nlots of image providers (including\nGetty, the photo source for all\nnewspapers), we had it covered!\nThe mostly Imperial team,\ncomprised of Ben Miles, Florian\nRathgeber, Aeneas Wiener and\nThomas Lim joined forces with\nthree other entrants. Our work with\nImperial Create Lab and ICSaaS\nmeant we have the creative and\ntechnical skills to execute on a cool\nidea. The concept of balanced news is\none which we liked; there are always\ntwo sides to a story, but when reading\narticles on the internet, it is all too\neasy to get an unbalanced view.\nOur hack pulled in realtime\nnews stories from the BBC News\nLabs experimental \u2018Juicer\u2019 API. We\nanalysed the content with sentiment\nanalysis to \ufb01gure out which \u2018side\u2019 of\nthe story it was about. Articles are\naugmented with various associations\nto people, places, oganisations, events\netc., which we used to query for\nrelated articles. With more sentiment\nanalysis, we could work out the article\nwith views most di\ufb00erent to the\n\ufb01rst one analysed. At this point, we\nanalysed any Tweets which had been\nshared with the URL to the article\nin it. We measured the sentiment\n(both for positivity or negativity, and\nstrength of view) of all tweets, and\nthe aggregate scores were factored\nin to how we displayed articles on\nthe page. We named it Oppozeit, as\nwe combined the zeitgeist nature of\nmany news aggregation tools, whilst\nshowing the opposing sides of an\nargument.\nArticles were rendered side by\nside (the two \u2018opposing\u2019 articles in\nquestion), with the proportion of the\npage given to each one being based\non which articles were getting the\nmost vocal support on Twitter. The\nbackground colour was based on how\nstrong opinion and language was in\nthe article itself, with a darker shade\nindicating strong language. The image\nbackdrop was pulled from Getty, with\nthe articles \u2018key words\u2019 (also provided\nby the BBC \u2018Juicer\u2019 service) being\nprovided as search terms.\nAll in all, we felt it was an impressive\nhack considering the time frame!\nWe were delighted that Seedcamp\ndecided to announce us as winners of\nSeedhack 4.0! Some hackathons have\nimpressive prizes\u2013 over \u00a31000 in cash,\na trip to the US are some we\u2019ve come\nacross (but sadly not won) recently.\nSeedhack tops it all though\u2013 a Star\nTrek Enterprise Pizza cutter. The\nEnterprise does of course represent\nthe cutting edge of Innovation, so what\nbetter way to cut pizza at hackathons\nand when working at a startup? We\nlook forward to our next Hackathon,\nbut in the mean time check out our\nlive demo: oppozeit.me and stay\ntuned as we develop our hack!\nSpeedcamp\nannounce winners\nof SpeedHack 4. 0\nThomas Lim\nWriter\nwardens have raised a possible legal\nissue surrounding the changes. The\nfrequency of the cleaning service is\none of the terms and conditions of\nthe Accommodation License that\nall halls\u2019 residents have to agree to\nbefore they can accept an o\ufb00er of\naccommodation. As mentioned in at\nthe start of this year\u2019s contract, College\nAccommodation Licence (2013\n-2014), the licence contains legally\nbinding obligations that apply to\nstudents. However, this year\u2019s licence\nstill states in Section 4 (Cleaning)\nthat \u201cAt all accommodation with\nthe exception of Xenia all kitchen,\nreception and other communal areas\nwill be cleaned daily, Monday to\nFriday, and study bedrooms will be\ncleaned fortnightly...\u201d\nThe disparity between the contract\nsigned by every student in College\naccommodation and the cleaning\nservices provided by College has\ncaused some concern in the halls\u2019\npopulation. Several halls\u2019 residents\nhave sent in complaints to Campus\nServices regarding what they consider\nto be a breach in contract, to which the\ndepartment replied, \u201c\u2026We do reserve\nthe right to vary the frequencies in\norder to avoid having to increase our\nrunning (and therefore rental) costs.\u201d\nHowever, this does con\ufb02ict with the\ninitial response we received from\nCampus Services (see above) where\nthey state that cleaning service levels\nare not considered when calculating\nstudent rents. Felix looks forward to\ntheir clari\ufb01cation on this issue.\nLast year\u2019s Union President and\ncurrent sub-warden Paul Beaumont\nsent a letter of complaint (in a personal\ncapacity) to the Rector, Provost,\nCollege Secretary, and Associate\nProvost (Institutional A\ufb00airs) this\nweek, in which he stated, \u201cAlthough\nthe licence reserves eight other\nrights to vary the contract, altering\nthe frequency of cleaning is not one.\nAn organisation cannot (or should\nnot \u2013 even if it reserves the right to)\nvary a contract except under extreme\ncircumstances. \u2018Re-tendering\u2019 and\naltering the provision to save money\n(but not passing on this saving to the\ncustomer) is not, in my or in any of\nthe residents I\u2019ve spoken to views, an\nextreme circumstance.\u201d\nFelix has asked Campus Services\nto respond to a few questions, asking\nto have more information about\nthe feedback process they used to\nsolicit student feedback, as well as\nthe number of the respondents who\npreferred monthly cleaning. We\u2019re\nalso hoping to be told more about the\ndecision process and how they plan to\noperate for the rest of the year.\nHowever, we are aware that Campus\nServices will be reviewing the cleaning\nprovision in the near future, especially\nfor areas where the level of cleaning in\ninadequate, with a view to increasing\nthe level of cleaning in these areas\n(i.e. kitchens used by large numbers\nof students). We have also heard that\nthey have provided some cleaning\nmaterials for students to use and we\nlook forward to further developments.\ncontinued from page 1...\nOPPOZEIT\n\n"

They\nare an organisation that will regularly\nprovide a bundle of games for any\nprice you want to pay, and if you pay\nabove the average (normally around\n\u00a35) you will get some more \u201cpremium\u201d\ngames. Once you have selected how\nmuch you want to pay you can choose\nwhere your money goes- to charities\nlike Childs Play or to the game de-velopers. Recently I bought the Indie\nBundle 9 which contained some great\ngames; Limbo, Bastion, Fez, Mark of\nthe Ninja, Eets Munchies, FTL, A Virus named Tom\u2026amongst others.\nHere is a review of the \ufb01rst 3 games.\nLimbo is a 2D side-scroller like no\nother. Although at \ufb01rst it seems a very\nsimple game, the only controls being\nmoving left to right, grabbing objects\nand jumping, the puzzles that you solve\ngrow in complexity leading to some\nthat will take some precise controlling\nand thinking to conquer. Visually is\nwhere this game really stands out, the\nI think Fez is my favourite. In fact it\nmight be one of my favourite games of\nall time. Fez is a puzzle game in which\nyou can only see 2 dimensions of the\n3-dimensional world at any one time.\nThe fez you wear gives you the ability to rotate your point of view by pi/2\n(degrees are for babies) so you can view\nthe world from a new perspective (im-agine that you can only see one side\nof a cube at any one time). In fact this\nis very much like Flatland as a video\ngame. The object of the game is to collect cube pieces (that come in two siz-es; small ones that make a completed\none and a completed one). These are\nhidden around lots of stages that connect to each other by doors and por-tals. The world itself is complex and it\u2019s\neasy to \ufb01nd new areas and lose yourself\nas even the map isn\u2019t that helpful, but\nthis just adds to the multidimensional\nthinking that you need to solve the\npuzzles. Fez plays like a platformer and\nthe beautiful pixel art adds to give this\ngame a retro feel. Games like this are\nwhy I like Indie games so much. They\nare original, inspiring and are just great\nfun games to play. Fez will provide\nhours of fun and a long challenge if\nyou want to 100% complete the game.\nBastion isn\u2019t one of the games I originally bought the bundle for, but as soon\nas I tried it I was hooked. This game is a\nspace-western action role play game in\nwhich you play as a survivor of a world\nchanging event called the Calamity.\nYou are brought to the Bastion which\nlets you jump o\ufb00 to fractured pieces of\nthe world in order to collect fragments\nwhich increase the Bastions power.\nAs the Bastion becomes more powerful you gain the ability to choose and\nupgrade buildings such as the armoury\nwhich lets you switch out the weapons\nyou \ufb01nd throughout the levels, and the\nDistillery which lets you brew beverages which gives you special powers. The\nbeauty of the game lies in its simplicity.\nThe art style is unique and the world\ngets created in front of your eyes bit by\nbit. There is a narrator that constantly\ncomments on every aspect of the game,\nfrom you standing up at the beginning,\nto you falling o\ufb00 the edge. You might\nthink this would be annoying, but actually this is one of the best features of\nthe game. The narrator often adds comedic value and gives you important\nlore and backstory seamlessly, without\nthe action stopping. To top o\ufb00 what is\na wonderful game, the soundtrack is\none of the best of any game. Pick this\ngame up! It is a very easy game to just\njump into and enjoy for as long as you\nhave time for and the new-game plus\nwhere you keep the levels you\u2019ve accumulated so far gives it replay value.\nk ... you ... b*tches!\nblack and white minimalistic world is\nmore like a piece of art and is enchanting the whole way through the game.\nThis game is a horror game but there\nare no planned jump moments, the\nhorror works entirely on the simplicity\nof the world and its creepy inhabitants.\nOne of my favourite things was the terrifying spider you meet in the beginning who keeps coming back to surprise you in some quite comedic ways.\nThe controls are simple, but smooth\nand respond exactly as you would expect especially when using a control-ler. Although the game itself is very\nlinear, there are plenty of hidden areas\nhinted at by the games achievements,\nand after you have completed the 4-5\nhour storyline you will probably want\nto go back and explore. Maybe you will\ncomplete challenge of completing the\ngame in one sitting with only 5 deaths?\nOverall this game demonstrates\nthe originality of Indie games and I\nwould recommend this to everyone.\nOut of all the games in this Bundle\nThe Felix games team were kindly\ngiven a copy of Prison Architect by\nIntroversion. In this game you act as\nan architect and overseer of a Prison.\nYou get to hire sta\ufb00, build the prison,\nand then watch over as you gain more\nprisoners make money and expand.\nMany, many hours and just as many\nfailed Prisons later I am ready to tell\nyou just why you should buy this game.\nFirstly the game has its own charming art style. It looks amazing and\ndoesn\u2019t take too good of a computer to\nrun it smoothly. The only downside is\nyou feel too attached to your cute little\nprisoners and need to constantly click\non them to remind you of the horrible\ncrimes they have committed (such as\nsaying FIRST on too many YouTube\nvideos) so that you can give them a\nharsh treatment, probably because you\nspent all your money and can\u2019t a\ufb00ord\nniceties. The game itself starts with a\nshort tutorial, which teaches you the\nand error how to create a successful\nPrison. My \ufb01rst prison failed because\nI had no walls and so all the prisoners\njust walked away. The second because\nI didn\u2019t realise that you could stop accepting new prisoners each day and\nso I had 48 prisoners with only 1 cell\nand 2 guards, which led to endless riots and the death of one of my guards.\nHowever attempt 3 and I was ready to\nmake a fairly successful prison. A prison with the right number of cells and\nbasics of building controlling your\nworkforce. This tutorial ends in an execution and even has a short animation that shows you the prisoner committing his crime and then repenting.\nI\u2019ve not been so moved since I watched\nDead Man Walking! I can tell that\nthis game as well as being entertaining will make me question my morals.\nWhen you are then thrown into the\nbig open world of Prison Architect\nyou learn very quickly through trial\nshowers that didn\u2019t \ufb02ood all the time!\nThis was just the beginning. Now\narmed with grant money and my own\naccountant, each day brought in more\nmoney which I can use to upgrade the\nprison. The warden unlocks bureaucracy in which you can specialise in\ncertain aspects of running a prison.\nSo soon my prison had its own health\ncentre armed with a psychologist, and\na chief of security who told me that in\nfact the prisoners I thought would be\nhappy with their small cells were not\nhappy. Worried that they were up to\nsomething I conducted a shakedown,\nand searched all the prisoner\u2019s rooms.\nEventually this ended with me con\ufb01scating a whopping 67 items from\n22 prisoners and about half of them\ncommitted to solitary con\ufb01nement for\nstarting \ufb01ghts with my guards. Also\nmany of prisoners had been digging\ntunnels to freedom. This saddened\nme; I gave them so much a love! A big\nshower that doesn\u2019t \ufb02ood, food once a\nday, a room with a bed and a toilet...\nWhat more could they want from me?\nWell \ufb01nally back on track I opened my\nprison to some high risk inmates and\nthus started the greatest tragedy in the\nhistory of Chenty Prison. For some\nreason the workmen making my new\ncells used the front door of the prison\n(as in took it out to place somewhere\nelse). When my high risk prisoners\narrived they were able to just walk\nout. This \ufb01asco ended in 3 deaths, 2\nunconscious prisoners and 3 escapes.\nThis is a great thing about the game;\nyou can play it exactly as you want.\nYou can spend time architecting the\nmost beautiful prison, make a prison\nthat keeps all the prisoners happy, just\nmake a big mass prison and su\ufb00er the\nconsequences like I did or accept new\nprisoners every day which is a chal-lenge! If you get bored of your own\nprison you can download other peoples from the steam workshop. Someone has even made the prison from the\nShawshank Redemption. This game\no\ufb00ers so much for how simple it is and\nit\u2019s just in the alpha phase of its devel-opment. Not since Minecraft\u2019s beta\nhaveIfeltsoexcitedforupdatesadding\nnew features. This is a game I will continue to play for a long time yet.

One of these students\nis Mingming Yang, only a graduate\nin the \ufb01fth year of her PhD, but who\nplays one of the biggest parts in this\nstory.\nExperiments within the Large Hadron Collider had been repeatedly run\nC\nurrently, experiments at\nCERN have halted, giving\ntime for maintenance\nwork and a renovation\nof its equipment to\ntake place. It is set to continue its\nexperiments in 2015, where the\nenergy intensity of its collisions will be\nincrease from 4 trillion electron-volts\nto 6.5.\nThe excitement caused by the Higgslike particle discovery has seemed to\novershadow the rest of the achievements that CERN have been able to\nproduce. A host of theoretical particles were \ufb01rst seen in collisions tested\nby the LHC, which was installed in\n2008. These have enabled theories to\nbe put to the test and have con\ufb01rmed\nour ideas about the universe, the\nStandard Model, which predicts the\ninteractions of fundamental particles.\nThe Higgs was \ufb01rst announced to be\ndiscovered earlier this year as sepa-rate, repeatable experiments gave rise\nto complementary results. So, what\ndirection does CERN to take its\u2019 experiments in 2015? While the experiments showed that a particle was observed with a mass similar to what was\npredicted, there are other characteristics of twhe particle \u2013 spin, parity, decays \u2013 could change our understanding of the Standard Model, if what we\nthought was the Higgs was actually\nslightly di\ufb00erent.\nSo far, the results from the di\ufb00erent\ndetectors, LHC, ATLAS, CMS, have\nbeen consistent with what we have\npredicted. If, in the pursuit of these\nunanswered questions, we \ufb01nd new\nparticles, we would have to revise our\nposition. More experiments could\nprovide evidence for the Standard\nModel, or super-symmetry, or even\nlead to the formulation of a new para-digm.\nThen there are those areas of physics\nthat we are still unable to account for.\nWhere does gravity \ufb01t into the Standard Model? Why is there so much\nmore matter than anti-matter? What\nabout dark energy? Currently, we have\nonly been able to account for 5% of the\nobserved mass in the universe. The\nrest of this is made up of dark energy\nand matter \u2013 dark because we have\nnot been able to see it yet.\nConversely, the ALICE experiment\nhas been trying to replicate conditions\nof the early universe. In the instant\nafter the big bang, there was a lot of\nenergy and heat about. Many di\ufb00erent\ntypes of particle popped into and out\nof existence before they could even interact with much else. Try to recreate\nthese conditions understandably takes\na lot of energy, but if we were able\nto \ufb01nd what made up the primordial\nsoup of particles, we would be able\nto see how the particles changed and\nevolved over time, leading to where\nwe are today.\nThe Collider exhibit at the Science\nMuseum displays the journey undertaken on quest for the Higgs boson.\nHowever, rather than being the end of\na long search, we are in reality still taking the \ufb01rst few steps towards greater\nunderstanding.\nfor several months running up to\nthe discovery, but the data had simply been squirrelled away before one\ncomplete, \ufb01nal analysis. This analysis\nthat would either con\ufb01rm completely\nthere was a boson, or return them\nback to square one. Up until June 15th,\nno one had seen this \ufb01nal set of data.\nThe revelation and analysis of this\nlife changing dataset was called the\nunblinding. On June 15th, this un-blinding was done by Yang, alone in\nthe early hours of the morning. It was\ndown to her, alongside a few others,\nto con\ufb01rm if their research was about\nto propel them into dizzying heights\nof fame within the scienti\ufb01c community or\nsimply come crashing\ndown around them.\nIn the exhibition\u2019s\n\ufb01lm, an actress, who\nportrays Yang as a\nnortherner, features\nher talking about\nsleeping in her o\ufb03ce,\nrelentless work and\n\ufb01nally the triumphant\nfeeling when she \ufb01rst\nrealised the data did\nindeed prove the boson to exist.\nLater on in the ex-hibition, in a mock\nup of the CERN hall-ways, a projection of\nthis actress is pacing\nup and down in an\nactual o\ufb03ce, amidst\nwhite boards covered\nin scribbles, over\ufb02owing \ufb01ling cabinets and\na star wars box set (on\nVHS).\nIt is in this mock up set, her northern stunt double pacing on repeat being her, that we met Yang, who \ufb01rst\ncommented on the size of the lab. \u201cIn\nreality, my o\ufb03ce was half the size, and\nI shared it with four other students.\u201d A\ncharming, friendly woman, she didn\u2019t\neven reveal her role in the boson discovery until much later. It seems that\ngraceful humility is a common thread\nthroughout the realm of particle phys-ics, with Higgs himself also being demure and modest in his role of the\ndiscovery.\nShe took time out of her busy schedule to come to the launch, but unfortunately her colleagues were unable to\ndo the same. \u201cThey just have too much\nwork,\u201d hinting that the discovery was\njust the beginning of a longer, more\nextensive road into the depths of particle physics.\nWe asked her what she thought of\nCollider, and if it was true to what\nhappened at CERN at the time. On\nher northern representative, she says\nthat the excitement displayed by the\nactress was de\ufb01nitely subpar on how\nshe felt after unblinding the data. \u201cI\nwas jumping around, but I could not\ntell anyone. I was more excited then it\nis shown here.\u201d\nYang was also quick to dispel the\nidea that she was sleeping under her\ndesk- \u201cI did not do this, I stayed at a local B & B for 68 Swiss franks a night!\u201d\n-although she did admit to only getting about four hours sleep at a time\nin the past two years.\nShe was also keen to stress it is not\njust her role that makes the story so\nexciting. \u201cI think the play at the beginning is good; part of the story are the\nwords I said, but I think [the unblind-ing] is a combination of all the stories.\u201d\nDespite her own impressive role in\nthe unblinding, she spoke highly of\nher peers, mentioning Josh Bendavid and Fabian Stoedi, who were also\non the hunt for the Higgs boson. She\nstressed repeatedly that her colleagues\n\u201care going to be big [in the \ufb01eld] and\nare amazing at their job. They are\nsome of the best.\u201d During the run up\nshe was in constant contact with Josh\nin particular, \u201cI would call him up con-stantly, at 2pm, 3pm, and 4pm\u2026\u201d\nShe explained that for her, the un-blinding was the accumulation of a\nwhole team\u2019s e\ufb00ort, not just one moment of triumph, and through it they\ngained a sense of community unlike\nany other- \u201cThey are my colleagues,\nthey are teaching me, but they are\nalso my friends. This goal connects\nus together\u2026It is our work that we\nhave dedicated our entire life to, and\nwe have [sense of] belonging through\nthat. \u201c\nOn her time at CERN, she said it was\n\u201cthe most intensive three years, so after this I need to take a break!\u201d I ask\nher if all of this, the sleepless nights,\nthe small o\ufb03ce, the lack of air condi-tioning, the competition with ATLAS,\nwas a problem. It doesn\u2019t matter, Yang\nreplied. She simply said, \u201cI was happy.\u201d\nShe only had time to stay in the\nUK for a few days, as she is still analysing the data from 2011 and 2012.\nShe plans to publish her PhD thesis\nusing the data with the working title\nof \u201cOn the observation of the decay\nof the Higgs boson into 2 photons.\n\u201d An\nimpressive title that few other physics\nPhD students can o\ufb00er, but one she\ndeserves more than anyone else.\nHer team, the one she was so keen\nto talk about, the one whose successes\nshe heralded over discussing her own,\nand the team that has become her\nfamily, made her shine with pride.\nThey should be proud too, not just\nfor their work in the boson discovery,\nbut to have worked alongside what I\nfeel soon will become another great\nname in the world of particle physics\nin years to come.\nMingming Yang, standing in her replica of\ufb01ce\nMingming Yang\u02bcs replica desk space where the data was unblinded\n\n"

No matter\nif you are writing up your research\nproject on rotor stator disk rim sealing,\na model of the thermal structure of the\nNorth American lithosphere, or an\nessay answering the question \u201cWhat\nis a gene?\u201d, you are probably looking\nfor ways to top up your body\u2019s ca\ufb00eine\nlevel every now and then. If you want\nto make the most of your tea / co\ufb00ee\n/ Redbull / Monster, you might want\nto read on.\nScientists at Uniformed Services\nUniversity of the Health Sciences\nin Bethesda, Maryland, USA, have\nworked out that the best time to get a\ndaily hit of ca\ufb00eine is between 9:30am\nand 11:30am.\nThe Science\nSteven Miller, a neuroscientist who\ntook part in the research, explained\nthat this is due to how ca\ufb00eine\ninteracts with a key hormone \u2013 called\ncortisol. This hormone helps to\nregulate the body\u2019s own internal clock\nand promotes alertness.\nAfter a night\u2019s sleep, cortisol levels\nare naturally high and can remain high\nfor up to an hour afterwards, peaking\nbetween 8am and 9am on average.\nMr Miller argues it is better to then\ndrink ca\ufb00eine after this peak as it\npromotes cortisol production.\nHe said a tolerance of ca\ufb00eine may be\ndeveloped inside the body if we drink\nco\ufb00ee when the level of this hormone\nis high. This is simply because your\nbody does not need this extra dose\nof ca\ufb00eine. The natural cortisol peak\nforms part of your 24 hour rhythm -same reason why you are tired in the\nevening.\nMiller stated that one of the key\nprinciples of pharmacology is use a\ndrug when it is needed. Otherwise,\nwe can develop tolerance to a drug\nadministered at the same dose. This\nimplies that the same cup of morning\nco\ufb00ee will become less e\ufb00ective\nand you might need an extra shot of\nespresso for your morning co\ufb00ee to be\nas e\ufb00ective.\nMr Miller also found that cortisol\nalso peaks between noon and 1pm,\nalso from 5:30 to 6:30pm. He suggested\nthat having a ca\ufb00eine dose between\nthese pikes will be most e\ufb00ective.\nOf course, the cortisol cycle will\nvary from person to person, so will\nthe perfect time to have your cup of\nco\ufb00ee or can of Redbull. The time you\nnormally wake up will also a\ufb00ect this\ntime - early risers may \ufb01nd their ideal\ntime is earlier than those who get to\nenjoy a lie in.\nSo what is cortisol?\nCortisol helps to increase glucose\nin the bloodstream by converting\nfrom stores of energy. This hormone\nproduced in high levels especially in\ntimes of stress. This energy release\nmakes us more alert in the morning,\nbut making us hungry at the same\ntime.\nScientists have also found that\ncortisol is also responsible for\nsynchronising the internal daily\nrhythms that operate in the body.\nWant to show off your\nculinary skills?\nAre you a budding cook or a first timer?\nCooking for your flatmates or going alone?\nWell, share the photos of your lovely meal on\nTwitter and Instagram and hashtag it with\n#FelixFood.\nIt (and perhaps your recipe) could appear on Felix!\nHave fun choosing your filters!\nMachine to tell Horses from Cows\nRemember the horse meat scandal\nearlier in the year?

I don\u2019t know if anyone\nat CERN actually dresses like that,\nbut the eccentric academic image is\ncharming and not too innacurate.\nThis is the introduction to Collider: a\nreconstruction of the meeting where\nthe observation of the Higgs boson\nwas \ufb01rst announced, at the Sceience\nMusuem.\nThe professor, the particle beam\ncontroller and two PhD students talk\nus through the days leading up to the\nannouncement, interspersed with\ndescriptions of the Large Hadron\nCollider and a history going back\nto J.J. Thompson\u2019s discovery of the\nelectron: his own cathode ray tube is\none of the exhibition pieces. There\u2019s\neven a cameo appearance from Brian\nCox as a co\ufb00e-running intern.\nThe story is a personal rather than\ntechnical one, focussing on the\nfriendly rivalry between the ATLAS\nand CMS experiments and the sheer\nanticipation and excitement that come\nwith each unblinding \u2013 the name\ngiven to the revelation of collision\ndata to a researcher, done only after\nthe analytical methods had been\ndetermined to eliminate bias.\nOne of the students reveals that she\u2019s\ngiving the presentation \u2013 she was the\none who \ufb01rst saw the Higgs after the\nunblinding.\nEven watching a reconstruction, I\ncould feel the tension \u2013 the collective\ne\ufb00ort of 10,000 engineers and\nscientists over ten years, working to\nprove a theory \ufb01rst published half a\ncentury ago.\nWe\u2019re shown a clip from the real\nannouncement before the professor\ninvites us to see the LHC tunnel,\nushering us in to the rest of the\nexhibition.\nA twisted entrance simulates the\nlift ride down, and we\u2019re brought to\na curved corridor where pieces of the\naccelerator are on display along with\nquirky whiteboards that explain the\ntheory behind the hunt for the Higgs.\nA circular room hosts a huge\nprojected wireframe simulation\nof beam acceleration and particle\ncollison, awesome in scale and a little\ndizzying. Protons are represented as\nballs covered in cute yellow fur \u2013 a\ndecision made under guidance from\nresearchers from CERN, who have\ncollaborated to develop the exhibition.\nFinally, we enter a model of the\nCERN o\ufb03ces, where a video shows us\nthe PhD student from the introductory\nlecture in the minutes just before and\nafter the unblinding.\nOnce again, the feeling of the\ndiscovery is captured \u2013 but the actual\nexcitement was far greater, as we were\ntold by the actual student who \ufb01rst\nsaw the particle, also a guest at the\npremiere.\nThe exhibition corridor I found a\nlittle underwhelming compared to the\nvideos, but as a science student who\nalready knows most of the facts, that\u2019s\nHiggs visits the exhibition, based around the boson that he conceptualized\nOne of the visitors studies a photo of the inside of the Large Hadron Collider\nto be expected.\nAimed at adults and teenagers,\nchildrenmightbeboredbythedisplays\nwhich don\u2019t o\ufb00er any interactivity.\nThis is an exhibition to bring visiting\nparents along to, for both technical\ninformation and the human story\nbehind the Higgs boson search.\nProfessor Higgs and the press collide\nFelix Science goes along to the launch of the Science Museum\u02bcs new exhibition\nT\nhis Tuesday saw the launch\nof the Science Museum\u2019s\nlatest exhibition, Collider.\nThe \u00a31 million exhibition\nwas developed in close\ncollaboration with CERN. It provides\nan insight into both the workings\nof the collider itself, but also takes\nvisitors through the story of the\ndiscovery of the Higgs Boson, its latest\nsuccessful endeavour in its research\ninto particle physics.\nThe exhibition itself provides a virtual experience of the conference at\nCERN that took place earlier this year,\nwhen they \ufb01nally con\ufb01rmed the boson\nto exist. Visitors sit in a mock up lecture theatre, whilst videos projected\non the walls around them show members of the CERN team talking about\nthe discovery. It was here that we were\nsat to watch the launch, with speeches\ngiven by those involved to explain just\nwhy Collider is a vital contribution to\nthe plethora of other exhibitions the\nscience museum has to o\ufb00er.\nProfessor Higgs himself was present\nfor the unveiling, much to the excitement of the press and the scienti\ufb01c\ncommunity, who turned up bright and\nearly Tuesday morning to pose their\nquestions. Universally acknowledged\nas a modest man, he rarely makes public appearances since the Nobel Prize\nthat he was awarded in October, and\nobviously this was on the agenda for\nthe press that were asking him ques-tions.\nIt was the press correspondent from\nthe Independent that was the \ufb01rst to\nbreech the subject of Tom Kibble, Imperial\u2019s own physicist who contributed\nto the boson theory but missed out on\nthe Nobel Prize.\nAfter enquiring as to whether or\nnot Higgs has spoken to Kibble since\nthe award, Higgs was kind enough to\nexplain as to why Kibble had only just\nmissed out:\n\u201cI think not many people are aware\nthat in 1964, there were a total of six\npeople who published papers on the\nStandard theory. There was three\ngroups, two people in Brussels, myself\nin Edinburgh, Tom kibble at Imperial\nCollege\u2026the two people in Brussels\nwere by a long way the \ufb01rst but they\nactually delayed publication because\nthey thought there had been mistakes,\nbut they were still ahead of me.\n\u201cThe other three at Imperial College\nlagged behind at time of publication\nand the consequence was that they\nwere not given credit. When it came\nto the awarding of a Nobel prize, the\nguidelines seemed to be that there was\nno more than three per prize.\n\u201cIf Robert [Brout, American-Belgian\ntheoretical physicist] was still alive he\nwould have been one of the three.\n\u201cBecause he died, there was a\npossible gap as it were\u2026it was to\naward the prise to the two survivors of\nthe \ufb01rst three.\n\u201cMy opinion before the award was\nannounced\u2026was that if they were\ngoing to award it to three people they\nshould include Tom Kibble, because\nwhat he wrote, in 1967, was abridged\nfrom my very simple model of 1964\u2026\nhis role was important and it was a\nshame that he was missed out.\u201d\nThe Director General of CERN,\nProfessor Rolf Heuer, also attended the\nlaunch, opening with the statement, \u201cI\nrecognise CERN here.\u201d He went on to\nexplain what the exhibition was about:\n\u201cIt will fascinate people, it will give\nthem a glimpse of what we are doing,\nhow we are doing it, what is the spirit\nof CERN, and what is the spirit of the\npeople working there.\u201d\nHis only criticism was about\nthe o\ufb03ce space displayed in the\nexhibition- \u201cThe o\ufb03ce space you are\nseeing there is much too large for a\nsingle person!\u201d\nHowever it was Ian Blatchford,\nDirector of the Science Museum\ngroup, which gave the most impressive\nopinion on the Collider exhibition.\n\u201cYou can go and see pearls at the\nV&A, you can go and see Columbian\ngold at the British museum, you can\nsee pulled clay at the Tate and you can\nsee collider here and forgive the ar-rogance, but of those four, I think, the\nmost pioneering and the most ambitious is here.\u201d\nAfter the talks, the press were invited to take a look around the exhibi-tion, which Keir has reviewed below.\nWe also managed to talk to the researcher who was the \ufb01rst to realise\nthat the boson had transcended from\na theory to reality, Mingming Yang.\nThe event is now open to the public,\nis running for six months, and entry\nis free.\nPA/Sean Dempsey\n\n"
