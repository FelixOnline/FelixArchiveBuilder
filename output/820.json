    "content": "The\nReviews\nBird\nBird-Charlie Parker, 1920-1954,\nwith Dizzy Gillespie, the innovator\nof Be Bop, legendary saxophonist,\ndrug addict and alcoholic.\nClint Eastwood\u2014tough guy hero,\noccasional mayor, man with lofty\npolitical aspirations and increasingly\nthought of as one of the best\ndirectors in America.\nEastwood shot Bird in a dark\nmoody way which is entirely suited\nto the feel of the film and the jazz\nclubs, bars and flats where most of\nthe action takes place. Flashback\nform is used to tell Parker's story,\nThe Hidden\nA thingy from outer space with a craving for loud music, loose\nwomen and gleaming Ferraris, takes\nover the body of a mild-mannered\naccountant and starts killing\neveryone. This seems to be its\nfavourite hobby.\nEnter Kyle McLaghlen (Dune, Blue\nVelvet) as a body inhabited by a good\nthingy from outer space, out to do\naway with the power crazy bad one.\nBut before he can close in for the kill,\nthe bad die alien has switched bodies\nto a grandad with a heart condition.\nAnd so the chase continues.\nA soft landing in Paris\nthese flashbacks are seen as Parker\ngoes through the last few weeks.\nDuring these weeks Parker attempts\nsuicide, faces drug withdrawal,\nnervous, breakdown, bereavement\nand professional disappointment.\nFairly catastrophic really. Bird does\nhave its high points; two scenes, a Jewish wedding and a tour of the\nSouthern States are particularly\nfunny.\nThe flashbacks concentrate on\nParker's relationship with his wife\nand a white trumpeter, as well as\nBird's struggle with drugs and\nalcohol.\nParker's wife Cham is played by\nDione Verona who puts real feeling\ninto her fight to get Parker off heroin\nand encouragement of his\nprofessional life, he has numerous\naffairs.\nThis all may sound like a ridiculously na ff sci-fi B movie, but\nit is very well made and is great\nentertainment. It never takes itself\nseriously and there is plenty of light\ncomedy and dark humour.\nMichael Noun plays an ail-American, worldly-wise street cop;\nthe type that saves the city from\nhoodlums before lunch. He feels\nthreatened by the young McLaghlen\nposing as an FBI agent, but his\ncynicism gives way to respect as the\nstory progresses.\nThere are probably some subtle\nmessages about today's society and\nquips at politicians, but why bother\nanalysing these when the\nAll the performances are good and\nthe subject is approached in a manner which, although barely\navoiding hero worship at times, has\na welcome lack of sentimentality.\nParker's rivals are often shown to be\nbland and the film tends to gloss\nover other problems Parker\nencountered, particularly racism\nwhich is only properly addressed in\none of Dizzy Gillespie's speeches.\nAt 2hrs45 mins long its length\nwould be a problem for those with\nno interest in jazz, which ties the\nscenes together. The score includes\nParker recordings with new backing\nmusicians to a superb quality and\nthis film cannot fail to spark a live\ninterest in the partially converted.\nPatrick Smith\nentertainment value is itself worthy\nof attention.\nThe action segments are fast and\nfurious\u2014the usual staple of blood,\ncar chases and explosions. This is\ncontrasted with sentimental looks at\nthe nice y nice y normality of the\nfamily of Noun's character. The\ntongue-in-cheek humour, though,\nmakes the film watch able. The\npublicity for the film likens it to\nRobocop, which is unfortunate, since\nit never approaches that standard.\nStill, fans of the action film wouldn't be disappointed and I'd recommend\nthis to anyone who feeds on a diet\nof Schwarzenegger movies.\n\u2022Sumit Guha.\nCommisar\nLumiere, St Martin's Lane, from\n7th April 89\nThe Commisar, the first and only film\nof director Alexander Askoldens,\nwas the surprise of the 1987 Moscow\nFilm Festival, where it was shown\nfor the first time since being banned\nin 1967.\nThe story is set during the Russian\ncivil war between the Whites and\nthe Reds, in the 1920s. Claudia\nVainlova (Wonna Mardyukova) is a tough, tank-like woman com m isar in the Red Army, who becomes\npregnant. To her fury, she finds she\nhas left it too late for an abortion,\nand is billeted in the small home of\na poor Jewish artisan and his large\nfamily. They resent her presence\nevery bit as much as she resents\nhaving to leave her hard soldier's life.\nHowever, the resentment fades\nwith the coming of Claudia's child.\nShe fusses over it, so that Maria\n(Raisa Niedashkovskaya), the\nartisan's wife, comments to her\nhusband, 'Look! The Russian cares\nfor her child like a good Jewish\nmother'. Behind the growing feeling\nof warmth in the household is a brooding tension. In childbirth,\nClaudia sees her army lover being\nshot, she sees the inevitable fate of\nthe Jews. Even the children at play\nchilling ly recreate the horrors.\nAs the White Russians begin to\nencroach on the town, Claudia is\ntorn between remaining as the\nfeminine figure she has become,\nand her devotion to duty as a Red\ncom m isar. The film is beautifully crafted with\nfine performances from the leading\ncharacters. Tight camera work, by\nVallery Ginsburg, sets the pace of\nthe film, with rapid movement\nbetween disturbingly large close-ups in the action sequences and\nlingering, soft shots in the family\nhome giving an impression of\npeace.\nBut why was a film which had a Red army com m isar obviously\nfighting the 'good' fight banned?\nComing as it did, after Russia's major foreign policy embarrassment\nin the Six Day War, it was the\nJewish elements of the film which\ncaused the problems. Askoldor was\nlocked out of the editing room and\nbanned from making any further\nfilms when he refused to cut certain\nscenes, and change the ethnic\norigins of the family.\nThankfully, we can now see this\nsuperb film in its full form, thanks\nto Soviet glasnost, and I would\nrecommend it.\nMichael Kirsch.\nPage 10 FELIX December 2 1988\n\n"

    "content": "Letters\nAs the world\nfalls down\nDear FELIX,\nOn the news item 'ceiling collapse' of the last,\nissue, Mr Peter Hallworth, the Managing\nSurveyor of Residences, said that there was no.\ndanger to students living in Evelyn Gardens. He,\nalso pointed out that there was no plan to re-;\nappraise the safety of the ceiling although the:\nceiling had quite frequently collapsed.\nI could not understand whether Mr Hallworth's comment on safety was based on his professional\njudgement or his own commonsense. It is\nridiculous to think that a collapse of a five foot\nsquare section of ceiling causes no danger to the\nstudents of Evelyn Gardens. My commonsense\ntells me that a2 inch thick piece of concrete of\n5' by 5' is heavy enough to kill.\nIf the occupant had been injured or killed, who\nwould have been liable for damages? The\nCollege, the Warden or Mr Hallworth himself?\nI really want to know what would be Mr\nHallworth's feeling if the collapse had happened\nin his bedroom.\nAnd finally, thank God I am still alive.\nYours,\nA.

Why is it\nif people from as far afield as Dundee can make\nthe effort to march that IC students cannot even\nmanage a quick tube ride across London.\nIt was particularly disappointing to note the\nabsence of any members of the Union Exec,\nperhaps if the President had considered the\ndemonstration important enough to attend more\nstudents would have followed his example.\nThose of us that did go on the march shouted\n'Baker Out!'\u2014the question is which 'Baker' were\nwe referring to??\nIncidentally, none of us are members of the\nSocialist Workers Party.\nYours sincerely,\nS Owen, Life Sci 3\nL Kenton, Life Sci 3\nN Bolton, Life Sci 3\nR Isaacs, Life Sci 3\nF Marsh, Life Sci 3\nW f Edmunds, Life Sci 3\nTA Dighton, Life Sci 3\nN Martinez Alier, Life Sci 4\nH Roberts, Life Sci 3\nC Zachary, Life Sci 3\nSouth Africa\nno platform\nDear Bill,\nI am writing to you to protest about the staging\nof a debate with a speaker from the South African\nEmbassy at Imperial College.\nThere can be few other institutions that are\nprepared to lend legitimacy to an oppressive and\nunjust regime by saying that it has a valid defence\nto be heard and debated.\nI would hope that rather than sitting back and\ncondemning the apathy of everyone else\nsomething can be done to prevent what can only\notherwise be seen as Imperial's support for the\nSouth African regime.\nYours etc.\nAlistair Goodall, DoC.\nPresident\nslammed\nDear Bill,\nThe President of ICU, the Hon Nigel Baker,\nstated at the UGM on 29.11.88 thai he needed\na further 1\n% weeks to formulate a paper to be\ncirculated about the introduction of student loans,\nbefore the EGM on 8.12.88. He said that people\nneed to know the 'facts' about what is happening\nand not have their judgement on here say and on\nthe media. Less than a minute later he\ncondemned the march on Parliament based on\nwhat he had heard. Does our President know\nwhat he is talking about?\nS Essen/, Life Science 2. ' -'\nGeorge Ingle\nFinch\nDear Bill,\nMight I ask through your letters column for\nhelp in getting back one of the life-size\nphotographs used for the Merger exhibition\noutside the Great Hall last month?\nThe photograph is of George Ingle Finch,\nProfessor of Applied Physical Chemistry here,\nwho was on the College staff from 1919 to 1952.\nHe founded the College Mountaineering Club\nand pioneered the use of oxygen in\nmountaineering as a member of Mallory's1922 Everest expedition. The photograph shows him\nin walking clothes and carrying a long walking\nstaff.\nAs such photographs are very expensive to\nproduce, we are naturally keen for its return, and\nso long as it is returned undamaged we shall ask\nno questions. We should be grateful either for its\nreturn or for information leading to its recovery.\nIf the person who has it wants to return it\nanonymously, then he/she will find the Archives\nOffices on Level 4 West of the Sherfield Building;\nit can just be left outside out of office hours.\nRichard Williams, College Archivist.\nBio Blues\nDear Bill,\nAs I feal repercussions from powers that be that\nmight seriously affect my future, I wish my name\nto be held by request. My complaint is simply that\nthe Biology Department persists in contravening\nCollege rules by holding practicals and lectures\non a Tuesday and Thursday lunchtime. This\nmeans students who wish to go to lunchtime\nactivities do so to the demise of their education.\nThis is compounded by the fact that out of, say,\na class of 20 three may wish to go to lunchtime\nactivities and by 'democracy' the three lose out.\nSecondly, and possibly a more serious\ncontravention, is the Biology Departments\nin sistance( including the Head of Department\nProfessor Anderson) on holding bc ture s at\n11.00am on a Tuesday thus clashing by half an\nhour with humanities lectures at 11.30, or by\nstarting practicals at 11am thus totally clashing\nwith humanities lectures, these practicals running\nover lunchtime. We are allowed to do humanities\ncourses (although the department does not\npositively encourage us to do them) and yet due\nto our department's time-tabling I know\npersonally of two biologists (and there are\nprobably more I don't know of) who have had\nto give up their chosen humanities option. I myself missed several practicals on my last course\ndue to\"the timetables. I have already complained\nto Chas Brereton as to what I feel is an\nunacceptable state of affairs but I very much get\nthe feeling that, unless serious action is taken\nagainst the department, this state of affairs will\ncontinue as it has done for at least the last three\nyears despite efforts to prevent it.\nName and department supplied, but withheld by\nrequest.\nPage 2 FELIX December 2 1988\n\n"

    "content": "Reviews\nThe Conquest of\nthe South Pole\nRoyal Court, Sloane Square\nA promising and exciting idea. Four\nunemployed young men a backwater town in Germany decide\nto recreate Amundsen's conquest of\nthe South Pole upstairs in the attic,\namongst the white sheets hanging\nup to dry. We follow the trek\nthrough the whiteness while real-life tags along for the ride. As the\njourney progresses, attitudes\nchange and mimic-ed hope and\ngoals take effect on the real lives\nbefore us.\nUnfortunately, The Conquest of the\nSouth Pole fails to conjure these\npromising ingredients into a satisfying whole.\nThe . script skirts around its\nsubjects saying much but meaning\nlittle, and without eloquence. There\nis a certain feeling for rhythm in the\nebb and flow of the words, but the\nhumour is rather heavy-handed, the\nwit lack-lustre, and most of the\npotential pathos ignored.\nIn a play depending so heavily on\nfantasy, while considering fairly\nhefty issues (a picture of the impact\nof youth, unemployment and, more\ngenerally, humanity's terrible need\nfor a purpose in life), it is vita' that\nthe surrealism of the imagery be\ncountered by real substance, to give\na sharp edge to the glitter. This is\nthe problem with this production.\nThere is energy, enthusiasm and\nferocity, but left un focussed it wafts\naway with the cigarette smoke,\nleaving behind no more than a fleeting impression of vague\ndismay. The characters rant and\nstomp and weep, but never\nprogress, never break free from their\nstereotypes. These people were not\nunemployed, but unemployable.\nThe swaggering, black dad leader\nwas hollow, and his foil, a quiet,\n. severe type, did not fulfil the\npromise shown by his request that\nthey switch characters and play the\nfailures of the story\u2014Scott and his\nmen. An annoying snivel ler and\nnondescript dowdy character\ncomplete the main line-up.\nThe action progresses in a rather\nhaphazard fashion; dowdy gets a job, but is in treated to continue the\nplay\u2014acting. Employment, while\nsupposedly the main villain of the\npiece, has virtually no effect upon\nthe characters when it strikes. This\npuzzling phenomena is\ndisregarded, and all of a sudden we\njoin hollow swagger-boy. He has all\nof a sudden tired of his role as\naggressive, cheerful leader, and is\novercome with unexplained'\n\u2022 tears...but just as suddenly decides\nthat all is alright with the world\nagain because he has fathered a child. The mother's refusal to\nacknowledge him as father, his\ncomplete inability to provide for the\nchild, and the presumably hostile\n' environment into which it is being\ndelivered do not seem to enter into\nthe calculation.\nThe Conquest of the South Pole is a disappointing production, sadly\ngiving the lie to the undoubted\npotential of the concept. It is spoilt\nby unsympathetic character is ation, and aten dancy to shout for the sake\nof style, rather than anger. What\ncould have been a moving and\nentertaining serious comic piece is,\ninstead, more of a modern firework:\nflashy, and without substance.\nSusan Appleby.\nScrooged\nCert PG\nYou get the impression from a film\nlike Scrooged that it was made more\nfor the sake of the Paramount\nexecutives than the public. It's as if\nthese money men in suits sat\naround a table one day deciding\nwhat they could wheel Bill Murray\nout for. Knowing that whatever he\ndoes would probably bring in the\nbucks, they sat back and built a film\naround him.\nIn general, this film isn't at all bad,\nbut does seem rather artificial and\ncontrived.\nThe film is set in the TV world,\nand in so doing makes some very\namusing comments along the way\nabout the tacky and patronising\nschlock that occupies most of US\nnetwork TV.\nA large network plans a truly\ndreadful production of A Christmas\nCarol\u2014the type of thing the general\npublic go for (like the Royal Variety\nPerformance that I was unfortunate\nenough to see the other day). The\nman responsible for this is Bill\nMurray (Ghostbuster, Stripes), who\nplays the president of the network.\nHis character is the modern-day\nscrooge; deriving pleasure in\nsacking employees on Christmas\nEve and planning to exploit the\nholidays for every rating point\nthey're worth. And so, in the best\ntradition of the Dickensian classic,\nhe is visited upon by three\nunwelcome d ghosts. The best of\nthese is easily Carol Kane as the\nghost of Christmas Present, a sugar\nFrank takes a breath of fresh air\nplum fairy who resorts to beating\npeople senseless to gain their\nattention.\nAlso intertwined in the plot are\nKaren Allen (Raiders of the Lost Ark),\nas the romantic interest, Rob\nGoldthwait (Police Academy 2, 3 and\n4) as a fired executive; and Robert\nMitchum, excellent in the comic role\nof the senile chairman of the board.\nThere are also several cameos from\nAmerican TV personalities such as\nLee Majors and John Houseman,\nwho send themselves up in\nhilarious scenes.\nBill Murray is, of course, perfect\nin his part. His irreverent humour\nis always a joy to watch. His\npresence alone is a good enough\nreason to see the film.\nThe one real sour point in the film\ncomes at the end. Murray's character changes too abruptly, and\ndelivers a schmaltzy speech about\nChristmas, which is lacking any sort\nof conviction. It is a moment that\nMurray is uncomfortable with, but\nin a moment of brilliantly wild\nimprovisation he turns it around.\nIn all, this is a 'feel good' movie\nwrought with moments of\ncringe worthy sop pines s, but it is\ngood fun. I 'll say no more. Go see\nthe film.\nSumit Guha.\nDecember 2 1988 FELIX Page 11\n\n"

    "content": "Opinion\nPolice brutality ?\nMany of you will have read the\nnewspaper reports of last\nThursday's student protest against\n'top up loans' or seen some of the\naction on the television. Yet,\nwithout having been there, you\ncannot understand the feelings of\nthe students nor the extent of the\nPolice brutality against what was a fundamentally peaceful demon\n-st ration.1 was there and I got hurt, both\nphysically and emotionally, and I would like to share with you my\nexperiences so that you will\nhopefully grasp the situation a little\nmore than the average Imperial\nCollege student or ICU executive\nmember seems to do at the moment.\nAbout twenty-five members of the\ncollege assembled at Beit Arch on\nThursday morning and travelled to\nULU to join a vast crowd of well\nover the expected 15,000 students\nwho had travelled from all over the\ncountry.\nThe feeling of the crowd during\nthe march South to the river was of\ngreat enthusiasm for a cause that,\nlet's face it, would directly affect\nvery few of the participants. This is\nsomething I have rarely experienced\nat Imperial College, where the major\nconcern seems to be the size of one's starting salary on graduation or the\nprice of beer in the Union Bar.\nThe march gave me some hope\nthat actually opposing the\nintroduction of student 'top-up'\nloans might achieve something\nbeneficial for future generations of\nstudents. As the vast majority of the\nmarch left the agreed route at\nWaterloo station, we were\ndetermined to lobby our MPs at\nWestminster.\nWe were not to know that thirty\nPolice horses and over 100 Police\nConstables and Officers with four\nriot vans were to meet us at the\nsouth side of Westminster Bridge.\nThey were intent on not letting any\nof us pass.\nI got near to the front of the crowd\nso that I could have some idea of\nwhat was going on - the Police never\ninformed the crowd of anything. It\nwas not until the following day that\nI discovered it is now illegal to\ndemonstrate within a mile of\nParliament when in session. Not\nthat the knowledge would have\nstopped me or the other 10,000\nstudents.\nAs it became apparent that the\nPolice were not going to let us\nthrough, much of the crowd\ndecided to push through the Police\nline. This was unorganised and\nhence ineffective and generally in\nignorance of what was happening\nto students at the front.\nIt would be an gross\nunderstatement to say that the\nPolice were violent beyond the call\nof duty. Indeed, they received no\nprovocation from the students - any\nreports you may have heard about\na barrage of miss ies being hurled at\nthe Police is a complete fabrication.\nIt is true that about two dozen\nplacard poles were thrown in about\ntwo hours, but since several of these\nbroke before the march had begun,\nunder the sheer weight of two\npieces of cardboard, they were not\nincredibly harmful to the Policeespecially since most didn't actually\nreach the Police line.\nDuring five or six futile attempts\nat breaking the Police line many\nstudents were assaulted,\nunprovoked, by the Police. At one\npoint, with both my arms visibly\ntrapped, a Policeman began to kick\nme in the shins. It was unprovoked\nand there was very little I could have\ndone to defend myself, and if I had\nretaliated I would have been\narrested or suffered further assault.\nMy injuries required hospital\nattention.\nThe assault ended as the\nPoliceman became involved in\n.further scuffles. However, despite\nbeing injured and not capable of\nprovocative violence, I was\nsubsequently kneed in the groin,\nheld in a neck lock and subjected to\nmuch intimidating verbal abuse.\nThis was un doubt ably intended to\nmake me decide that our peaceful\nprotest ought to disband.\nIn considerable pain I tried to\nmove back through the crowd. This\nproved pointless as there were just\ntoo many people and it was less\npainful to simply stand still. I was\nnot allowed through the Police line.\nI continued to witness quite\nshocking Police brutality I even saw\na horseman make his horse turn\nround and kick into the students.\nGirls were grabbed by their hair and\npulled screaming through the\ncrowd. Black people were\npreferentially snatched out of\ngroups of black and white students\nshouting (justify ably) abuse at the\nPolice.\nYet, when Police became cut off\nwithin the crowd, they were treated\ncourteously by the students.\nBetween crowd surges students\nwere seen to pat and stroke the\nhorses and peacefully protest our\ncase to the Police.\nThe final 'cavalry' charge of 25\nPolice horses at the packed crowd\nof 10,000 was totally unreal. It came\nwithout warning, and I was\nfortunate to be at the side of the\ncrowd. But if it had not been for\nfellow students pulling me out of\nthe way of the following wave of\nPolice on foot I would have suffered\nfurther injury.\nAs it was, many of the Police\nkicked, punched and jostled\nstudents as we tried to disperse\nfrom the area. The intimidating\nabuse continued and many\nindiscriminate arrests were made.\nAll of the students present were\nquite stunned at what had gone on,\nas were many onlookers, pass e is by\nand, believe it or not, some of the\nPolice. I hope that the inquiry into\nfile affair highlights the Police\nForce's unnecessary violence and\nintimidation as the major cause of\nthe incident at Westminster Bridge.\nI feel that if the Police had given\nthe students some positive option -such as laying down our banners\nand walking, as individuals, across\nthe bridge to lobby our MPs - then\nthe situation would not have\noccurred.\nPerhaps the NUS must take a small\nproportion of the blame, but at least\nthey were prepared to inform their\nmembers about the loans two weeks\nago and then organise some action\nto defend the future of the education\nsystem. Some 'independant'\nStudent Unions that I could\nmention ought to be thoroughly\nashamed of themselves.\nBy Andrew Player December 2 1988 FELIX Page 9\n\n"

    "content": "IN THE\nBritish Airways' latest 150-seat\nairliner, which entered service at the\nend of April, promises to improve\nair safety by taking advantage of\nrecent developments in electronics\ntechnology.\nAbout 75% of all air transport\naccidents have pilot error as a significant contributory factor.\nComputers aboard the Airbus\nIndustrie A320 reduce the likelihood\nof errors being made by reducing\npilot workload, and also by\nphysically preventing him from\nexceeding the limits of the\nAny one of four\ncomputers can fly the\nplane\naeroplane.\nExternally, the A320 looks\ndeceptively ordinary. But the use of\ndigital computers to control the\nplane and monitor the multitude of\nsystems on board makes it, in its\nown quiet way, as revolutionary as\nConcorde was in the 1970's. Passengers invited to see the flight\ndeck could be forgiven for thinking\nthat they had mistakenly stumbled\nacross an in-flight amusement\narcade. Gone are the thousands of\ndials and switches which\ncharacterised previous generations\nof airliner cockpit. In their place lie\nsix multi-colour cathode ray tubes-seven inch square TV screens\nwhich, instead of displaying the\nlatest space invader game, provide\nthe pilot with his speed, height and\nheading information.\nBehind the instrument panel\ncomputers are at work, ensuring\nthat information is presented to the\npilot in the most efficient way\npossible. The improved ergonomics\nreduce crew workload significantly,\nthereby contributing to the saftey of\nthe aircraft and its on-time arrival\nand departure. Besides flying the\nplane, the crew needs to monitor or\ncontrol engines, fuel, hydraulics,\nair-conditioning, electrics,\npneumatics, auxiliary power, and\nseveral types of radio and\nnavigation equipment. While the\npilot was once expected to do many\nof these jobs at once, he can now\nconcentrate on the most important\ntasks and let computers monitor\nother things. The passenger can be\nreassured that the plane is\nconstantly checking itself; the A320\nmakes certain that no checklist item\ncan be overlooked\u2014which in the\npast has so often been the cause of\ndisaster.\nA central warning system alerts\nthe crew to the onset of\nemergencies, and even displays the\nprocedure necessary to safely rectify\nthe fault. The pilot will be warned\nif his fuel is too low, if an engine is\nnot running healthily, if he has\nforgotten to lower the\nundercarriage, and so on. Built-in\ntest equipment aboard the A320\nprovides 95% probability of tracing\na fault to a single component, which\ncan easily and quickly be replaced\nas soon as the aircraft has landed.\nA further striking feature of the\nflight deck is the absence of the\npilot's conventional control column.\nInstead, the pilot is provided with\na miniature side stick, reminiscent of\nthe few visible clues that computers\nalso play a key role in helping the\npilot control the aeroplane.\nThe A320 is the first airliner to be\nfully equipped with computer\ndriven 'fly-by-wire' (FBW) controls.\nDnlike conventional aircraft, the\npilot is not linked to the plane's control surfaces by a mechanical rod\nand cable system. Instead the pilot's demands are converted into an\nelect ical signal; this passes via a computer to an actuator, which\nmoves control surfaces on the wings\nand tail.\nBy moving the side stick, the pilot\nis effectively telling the aeroplane\nwhere he wants to go. A powerful\ncomputer, performing 3 million\noperations per second, arranges for\nthe plane to move in this direction\nby deflecting the appropriate control\nsurfaces. If necessary, the computer\nmay modify the aircraft's response\nto prevent it from performing\npotentially dangerous manoeuvres.\nThis system is invaluable in an\nemergency situation, such as a near\nmiss, when A320 pilots can apply\nfull side stick deflection instantly,\nobtaining the maximum response of\nthe aircraft, without fear of stalling,\nor physically damaging the airframe\nby man oe uv ring too violently.\nThe A320, like most modern\nairliners, is equipped with an\n'autopilot', which automatically flies\nthe plane along a set route, and is\nusually only engaged during cruise.\nIn contrast, the FBW system is\ndesigned to assist the pilot during\nScience\ncritical phases of flight, such as takeoff and landing, when an autopilot\ncould not match the ability of a human pilot to cope with the\nunexpected.\nWith computers performing such\nimportant functions, designers have\nhad to ensure that component\nfailures or programming faults could\nnot result in catastrophe. The A320\nfeatures five man FBW computers,\nand any one of four of these is\nIt is as revolutionary\nas Concorde in the\n1970's capable of flying the aircraft\nperfectly safely on its own. These\ncomputers are of two different\ntypes, programmed by different\ncompanies working independently\nfrom each other, to minimise the\nrisk of software faults affecting more\nthan one computer. Protection\nagainst faults is such that the aircraft\ncan be dispatched with a failed\ncomputer, go on to suffer other FBW\ncomputer failures in flight, and still\nremain completely and safe t ly under\nthe control of its pilots. A mechanical back-up system protects\nthe aircraft from the consequences\nof complete electrical failure.\nImproved safety is only one of the\nbenefits of FBW. Civil airliners must\nbe specially strengthened to cope\nwith every eventuality, such as\nextreme stresses arising from rare\nviolent gusts and turbulence in\nstorms. This insurance places large\nweight penalties on aircraft\nthroughout their service life.\nThanks to sensors linked to the\nFBW computers, the A320 can\ndetect conditions of severe\nturbulence, and automatically\ndeflects the control surfaces to\ncounteract the 'stomach-churning'\nsensation of a sudden up-gust. As\nwell as improving passenger\ncomfort in rough weather, the\nreduction of loads imposed upon\nthe airframe enables substantial\nweight savings to be made, allowing\nmore passengers and cargo to be\ncarried whilst consuming no more\nfuel.\nThe benefits of using such\nadvanced technology have not gone\nunnoticed. With nearly 500\ncommitments from 20 airlines, the\nA320 is selling faster than any\nairliner in history. The European\nmanufacturing consortium, in\nwhich British Aerospace has a20% stake, are justifiably confident that\ntheir latest product can threaten\nAmerican dominance of the 150-seat\nairliner market.\nPage FELIX December 2 1988\n\n"

    "content": "LIVE\nAl Stewart\nDominion Theatre\nIt takes a certain type to be an Al\nStewart fan. There we sat, all of us\nbearded and wearing scruffy\ngreatcoat s re-living the early\nseventies when folk rock was still a viable form of music. Us folk ies are\na queer lot, friendly to each other\nwhilst eagerly awaiting someone\nwho hasn't toured for four years\nand hasn't had a hit record for\neleven. (Year of the Cat, the record\nthat everyone's older brother has a copy of and must have been the\nthing to persuade Johnny Rotten to\ntake up punk). Al is back with a new\nrecord company, a six piece band\n(unnecessary as the best songs are\nhis solos) and a new album which\nis hailed as the eighties classic\n(whatever that means), and could\nhave been written at any time since\nabout 1965.\nOf course he played lots of YOTC\nand one or two of his other notable\nditties, tastefully updated to give the\nband something to do. We all\nshouted out requests and he even\nplayed one or two 'cos he likes to\ngive us punters what we want.\nThere was no pretentious light\nshow, probably because he can't afford it any more although his\nsaxophonist was wearing a totally\npretentious pair of leather trousers\nand a courgette which more than\nmade up for the lack of effects.\nSexy Al Stewart\nEveryone had a solo spot, but\nPeter White had lots as he can play\nthe Spanish guitar and this fits in\nwell with the soft-rock songs. We\neven had a special guest appearance\nby some guitarist who plays with\nMarianne Faithful and who I 've\nnever heard of. So we all had a happy evening reliving the\nseventies and went home to our\nbeds its to contemplate why Neil\nTennant of the Pet Shop Boys sounds\njust like our Al and makes much\nmore money.\nMusic\nLIVE\nThe Coltranes\nSt Vitus Dance\nAn old warehouse, a vaulted cavern\nin Liverpool's deserted Stanley\ndock. Wet outside and misty in,\npods of light half-illuminating\nshadowy figures; a scene from a New York alley, steam rising from\nthe grates, tension in the air before\na rumble. -The event is the Liverpool\nUniversity Architects Party,\nstudents are milling around, there's something in the air tonight. A bar\nat one end, a stage and some tables\nimprovised from wooden things\nwhich hang around old\nwarehouses.\nThe rumble commences. The first\ncontenders are St Vitus Dance. Six\nmen on a less than generous stage,\nit is like Kooi and the Gang on a matchbox. The songs punch out\nthick and fast, constantly beating\nyou until you acknowledge the\nband. They're an Irish band so they\nplay the ob lig it ary ballad, but even\nthat had something special about it.\nThis band are on the sincere side of\njan gly pop.\nNext there is an intermission\ndisco, more students amble to the\ndancefloor, sensing more action.\nThe stage is rearranged, the bar is\nvisited and then The Coliranes arrive.\nThe Bristol band do not put up as\ngood a fight as their predecessors.\nAnother indie band, they do the\ntrick of merging in with all the other\nindies available. The sameness of\nThe Coitranes, apart from the odd\nbright spark, makes a light\nanticlimax to the event.\nWith everybody gone the\nwarehouse looks like a desert with\ntumbleweed crisp packets blowing\naround and the smell of lager from\nevery surface. Had to imagine that\nin a few hours it will be the site of\na market.\nCLASSICAL Jessye\nNorman\nImagine an ample but graceful\nwoman with an assured air and you\nwould have a fair idea of what\nJessye Norman looks like; but if you\nhear her voice you will realise why\nsome of us worship her.\nFirstly, she is power-ful, not only\nin volume but also in her ability to\ncapture the attention of an audience\ncompletely. Those who have seen\nthe French film Diva will have\nexperienced this spine-tingling\nrapture. Her enunciation is perfect\nin at least three languages other\nthan English, so that those who\ndon't have any German can still\nappreciate the beautiful sounds of\nGoeth's poetry. She can\ncommunicate the emotion behind\nthe words, so that we are swept\nalong into the music and feel, with,\nher, excitement or melancholy.\nIf you want to hear her for\nyourself, here are three recordings\nthat I recommend highly:\n1. Schubert: Lieder Philips 412\n623-X2. Brahms: Lieder Deutsche\nGramaphon 413 311-X3. Les Chemins D 'Amour Philips\n416 445-XPH\nThe first two are collections of\nGerman songs and the third of more\nmodern French songs. Each song is\nonly 2-3 minutes long and the mood\nalternates between fiery-fast and\nmellow-subdued. You are bound to\nfind some favourites here, though\nif you are new to the world of\nclassical music the Schubert and\nBrahms are safer buys. For Jessyejunkies, however, Les Chemins will\nbe a real shot in the arm, with its\njilted modern melodies mixed with\nsimple French charm. There are lots\nof twentieth century goodies here\u2014\nPoulenc, Duparc, Ravel, and a very\nwitty song by Satie. The most\nbeautiful is probably the title piece\nwhich could make a rugby player\ncry.\nRamin Nakisa.\nICSO\nThe ICSO produced a concert of\ntheir usual high standard, despite\nthe disruption of their rehearsal\nschedule by their performance at the\nCollege's Merger Ceremony. The\nopening piece, Mussorgsky's Night\non the Bare Mountain, a little scrappy\nin places, but nevertheless played\nwith the vigour and intensity\nnecessary for the piece and was very\nenjoyable.\nGeoffrey Silver was the soloist in\nthe Sibelius Violin Concerto. A mathematics students at Imperial,\nhe has played at the Royal Festival\nHall and was the leader of the\nNational Youth Orchestra for two\nyears. His performance was of the\n-highest calibre and, ably supported\nby the Orchestra, this was the\nhighlight of the evening for me.\nRichard Dickens produced, as\nalways, an excellent performance\nfrom the Orchestra for a packed hall\nand that will add to the many others\nthat have encouraged me to listen\nto these talented musicians at every\nopportunity.\nE.W.

In southern Utah, one\nseventh of all the national parks in\nthe USA lie within a200 mile circle.\nThe climate is generally dry and\nsunny\u2014average temperatures in\nwinter and summer are 6\u00b0C and\n31\u00b0C respectively, Utah is situated\nin south-western USA, an area often\ndescribed as the Golden Circle of\nScenic and Vacation Lands.\nThere are five national parks in\nUtah:\nArches\u2014Over 200 sandstone\narches cut out of a flaming red\ndesert amidst towering cliffs, oddly-shaped mountains and photogenic\ngnarled old pi nyon pines. Funny\nhow the gnarled trees never grew in\nfront of anything worth taking a picture of, though.\nThe altitude is between 4,000 and\n\u20225,600 feet, so hikers are advised to\ntake it easy if not used this type of\nclimate. There are trails here for\nas 'Schoolmarm's Britches'\u2014it looks\nlike a pair of legs).\nBryce\u2014 A hell of a place to lose a cow' Ebenezer Bryce is said to have\nremarked of his namesake. A delicate labyrinth of fairytale-like\nspires and columns and windows,\ntransl us cent white and orange, is\nbest observed at dawn, when the\ncontrast between light and shadow\nis greatest and a rosy tint is added\nto the scene. The Paiute Indians\ncalled these strange formations in\na mph i theatres of rock 'red rocks\nstanding like men in a bowl', and\nbelieved that evil creatures were\nturned to stone by a god in\nretribution. Hiking, horseback\nriding or moonlit walks are\navailable.\nCanyonlands\u2014The park boundaries lie around the confluence of\nthe Colorado and Green Rivers.\nFrom Dead Horse point\nbreathtaking views of the Colorado\nRiver goose-necks can be seen at\n2000 feet above the valley. Cataract\nCanyon is one of the most famous\nwhite-water rafting areas on the\nColorado River. Needles, spires and\nstanding rocks are supposed to look\nlike Mad Ludvig's castles in\nBavaria\u2014well....\nMonument Valley\nevery level of hiker although in\nevery case plenty of water and\nfrequent rests should be taken. Park\nrangers are only too happy to quote\nthe effects of dehydration of the\nbody.\nIf you only see one arch, be sure\nto see Delicate Arch, (once known\nCapitol Reef\u2014Local legend has it\nthat Butch Cassidy hid here. Domes\ncapped with white sandstone\nresemble the US Capitol, hence the\nname. Other interesting features\ninclude canyons and remnants of\nthe Colombian Indians of the.\nFremont Culture, eg petroglyphs.\nZion\u2014Zion is part of the same\ngeological sequence of depositions\nwhich formed the Grand Canyon,\n125 miles to the south, and Bryce\nCanyon. The Grand Canyon is the\n\u2022 oldest; Bryce Canyon the youngest.\nZion canyon was probably carved\nout of the rock by the Virgin River,\nalthough this is a matter of some\ndispute among geologists. Brilliant\nred ver milian cliffs are crowned for\na third of their height by\nshimmering white cliffs.\nA highly recommended three-hour walk is the strenuous five miles\nto Angels Landing, a promontory\ninto the canyon. From here an\nexcellent picture of the valley can be\ntaken. Just when you think you are\nnearly at the top for the hundredth\ntime, you suddenly realise that for\nonce the trail guide's warnings are\nnot at all exaggerated. You find\nyourself clinging to flaking\nsandstone and loose rusty chains\nhammered into the stone, looking\nat the knife-edge looming ahead or\nthe 1500ft sheer drop, amid gusts of\nwind, and suddenly remembering\nall those things in life you still\nhaven't done.\nAlso recommended is a trip to\nLake Powell\u2014org in ally a red desert\nvalley, the Glen Canyon Dam was\nbuilt across a narrow part of the\ncanyon and the valley accumulated\nrainwater over ten years until it\nreached the level it is today.\nLastly, the Great Salt Lake is well\nworth a visit. A trapper named Jim\nBridger floated into it from Bear\nRiver in 1824, and thought he had\nreached the Pacific Ocean. It\nappears a huge mirage above fairly\nbroken scenery. Its saline content is\nabout equal to that of the Dead\nSea\u2014apparently it is quite\ndangerous to swim in any sort of\nwind as large crystals, carried by\nwaves can cause some harm. The\nsmell was enough to put me off!\nTravelling Fares\u2014Around \u00a3375\nreturn to Salt Lake City via New\nYork.

    "content": "THE r.~... cR OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE UNION\nWhat a Whoppa\nThe Mechanical Engineering\nDepartment have begun work on a very large candle. The candle is to\nbe burned next to the Albert\nMemorial on December 10 in a televised event designed to raise\nmoney for the British Epilepsy\nAssociation.\nWhen complete, the candle will be\n10 metres tall with a diameter of 1\nmetre. Seven tonnes of wax are\nbeing used in the candle, which it\nis estimated, could burn for a month. The wax is being supplied,\nfree of charge, by Mobil Oil whilst\nThames Water Authority have\ndonated the pipe which forms the\nmould. The wick, a ships mooring\nrope, is being donated by a shipping\ncompany in Bristol. The stress and\nheat calculations for the candle have\nbeen carried out by Dr Sean Crofton\nof the Mechanical Engineering\nDepartment.\nIt is hoped that celebrity Terry\nWogan will attend the candle\nlighting ceremony in Hyde Park, the\nevent being broadcast in the TVS\nprogramme 'Motormouth'. After the\nceremony, the candle will be slung\nbeneath a Chinook helicopter and\nflown to the continent where it will\nbe used in other fund raising events.\nWork on the candle was\ntemporarily halted yesterday when\ntechnicians were unable to retrieve\nthe wick from within the mould.\nThe wick was eventually extracted\nwith the aid of a long hook and as ca folding tower. A tanker of hot\nwax was poured into the candle\nmould behind the Mechanical\nEngineering Building yesterday\nafternoon. The wax will take a week\nto solidify and shrink before the\nmould can be removed.\nCandlemaker, David Constable\ncommented 'I 've never made one\nthis big before; the biggest one prior\nto this was 20ft tall with an 8 inch\ndiameter'. Mr Constable is 92.\nMum's the word!\nDoug King\nQueen Mother photographed outside the RCM on Tuesday\nRefectories lose \u00a322k shock\nCollege refectories have made a trading deficit of \u00a322,000 over the\npast financial year, it was revealed\nat the House Committee last\nWednesday. The loss compares\nwith a gross profit of \u00a373,000 for the\npreceeding year. When asked how\nthe deficit had arisen Rob Northey,\nRefectories Manager, was unable to\ncomment. 'If I knew, I wouldn't have a problem', he told FELIX.\nThe Catering and Conference\nServices Management Committee\nappears to be attributing the loss to\nrising salaries. Operating costs,\nhowever, have fallen due to the\nclosure of the Main Dining Hall for\nrefurbishment. Although income\nwas up by 6% from last year, the\ncost of food sold rose by 16%,\nresulting in a5.8% decrease in gross\nprofit.\nOver the past six months there\nhas been extensive alteration of\nrefectory outlets, and the creation of\nnew ones, such as the Kebab Bar on\nSouthside. In the light of the\naccounts for last year it is likely that\nthe contribution to the Refectory\nCapital Programme for the\nrefurbishments will be of the order\nof \u00a320,000 rather than the forecast\nof \u00a3157,000! This will inevitably\nprompt a complete re-scheduling of\nthe repayments. Catering proved to\nbe the main source of deficit with a loss of \u00a370,000 as against a \u00a335,000\nprofit last year. This is again a result\nof the rising cost of salaries, despite\nan in cr. ese in turnover. The\nSouthside Shop also reported a reduction in takings and profits\ncompared with last year.\nBars throughout College made a4% profit, but again this is less than\nlast year, and not significant\ncompared with overall figures. The\nfirst glimpse of optimism comes\nwith the accounts for' the cellars.\nThese are able to report a profit of\n30% compared to a previous 9%.\nUnfortunately they were incorrectly\nbudgeted for a53% profit, the cost\nof sales having been underestimated. Mr Northey claims not to have\nseen or had any information about\nthe accounts before Wednesday's Committee meeting, and is unable\nto take any action until the figures\nhave been fully audited and agreed\nby the Catering and Conferences\nCommittee. His only comment on\nthe situation at present was T know\nnothing. I see nothing.'\nISSUE82002 DEC1988 "

As we travelled North out of\nLondon we found a landscape\ncovered in frost and the event area\nwas lightly sprinkled with snow, it\nmay have been cold but no one\ncould deny the beauty of the\nscenery.\nAll the IC competitors completed\ntheir courses, and some good times\nwere recorded, as a team we beat\nAston, and lost to Oxford (who are\none of the best University teams in\nBritain), but most importantly\neverybody had enjoyed themselves.\nWe then drove home stopping only\nfor tea at a hotel on the route.\nSQUASH League\nDraw\nMen's team draws with LSE 2-2\nPlaying one of the best teams in the\nleague without our regular number\n1 (whom last we heard was on\ncrutches!), we managed to persuade\nIC Football 1st team midfielder\nSimon Colege to make a comeback.\nHe played an entertaining game\nwith plenty of angled shots and\nextraordinary returns but lost out to\nthe LSE number 1, who is one of the\nLeague's better players. Ming Tan\n(no. 2) had to fight hard to win 3-2\nalthough always ahead, and always\nlooked the fitter of the two. Rustom\nKhambatta (no. 3) lost another close\n3-2 match after being ahead for most\nof the game. 'Old man of the team',\nMartin Croucher (no. 4) was head\nand shoulders above his opponent,\nand a bit generous in giving his\nopponent one game in his 3-1 win\n(although he wasn't that generous\nin the Bar later!).\nMEN'S HOCKEY Justified\nResult\nIC 4th s \u20146\nSt George's2 nds \u20141\n' and so, the eleven strangers\ncame together (for the first time!!!)\nand fused into a solid unit, fighting\ntogether as one.

Lying in fifth place overall,\na solid performance was needed at\nthe third race of the series, at\nWimbledon Common, in order to\nmaintain our challenge. However,\nthe recent cold spell seemed to affect\nthe form of several runners. Our\nfirst finisher was Frank Dudbridge\nin 14th place, followed by Alex\nGaskell in a rather disappointing\n49th. Matthew Lynas came 52nd, showing once again that this sport\nis where his true talent lies and that\nhe should give up orienteering\nimmediately. Our other scoring\nrunners were Dave Knight 67th, Pete Smith 68th and Stefan Ledin\n74th. We didn't manage to scrape a women's team together this time,\nbut it didn't stop Steve from\nwalking around behind the St\nMary's ladies and finishing in a pathetic 133rd place!\nA few days later we entered three\nteams for the Reading University\nRelays. The men's teams finished\n27th and 35th, the women's was\nim complete although the two\nAlisons braved the cold and ran\nrespectable times. The fastest men's runners were Frank Dudbridge\n(12'47 and 13'23) and Alex Gaskell\n(13'20). Dave Knight also performed\nheroics by running two legs.\nStefan Ledin (13'29), Bill Skailes\n(13'33) and Ramin Dilmaghamian\n(14T4) completed the teams.\nClub members meet for training\nat lunchtimes (12.30pm) in the\nUnion Gym. Athletics training takes\nplace at Battersea Park at 3.30pm on\nWednesday, and 11.00am on\nSunday.

The\nteam gathered early on Saturday\nmorning to do battle at Oxford\nagainst both Brunei University\nteams and Oxford 1st teams. A slight lack of wind led to a rather\nslow \u2022 start, but when the\ncompetition began Rory and Liam\nwent as if on rails, and were first\nhome easily. The commodore,\nRichard, was having problems with\nexhaustion, caused by a lack of sleep\nthe night before and he was looking\na little low. Unperturbed, in the\nsecond race he overcame this and\nwas also able to provide a good\nfinish. So, after two races and two\ndraws, Bill and Carol, who by now\nhad warmed up considerably, came\nto the rescue in the last and pulled\ntheir boat into the lead and held it\nto the end. This gave us a well-deserved win over Brunei's2 nd team. At this point racing was\nabandoned for the day due to lack\nof wind, the search for a pub with\na telly showing the rugby match\nthen began....of which more next\nweek.\nThe\nRoyal Sch\nMines\nANNUAL BALL\n16th December 1988\nSherfield Building\nDouble ticket \u00a350\n(from RSMU Office)\nBlack Tie\nDecember 2 1988 FELIX Page 13\n\n"

    "content": "auditoria l FELIX\nTHE BARON OF\nCHEAPSKATE\nNUS March Fifteen thousand\nstudents gathered in Westminster\nlast Thursday to protest against the\nGovernments planned introduction\nof 'top up' loans. Scenes of violence\narose when three thousand of the\nmarchers left the official route and\nclashed with Police as they\nattempted to lobby Parliament.\nThe papers told of students\nbombarding the Police with coins,\nsticks and tins. Eye witnesses claim\nincidents of Police brutality and the\nindiscriminate use of Police horses\nagainst the students.\nIt would be difficult to say,\nwithout attending the march,\nwhether the students or the Police\nwere to blame.\nUnion President, Nigel Baker's remark that 'the activities of the\nstudents on the march summed up\nwhy the exec were not prepared to\ntake part in such a farce' is at best\npresumptuous.\nThe NUS, were at least prepared\nto do something, and I am sure that\nthe President of the NUS did not\nhave to wait to be mandated by the\nother Union Officers before she read\nthe White Paper on student loans.\nWhat it all boils down to, of\ncourse, is the President's reluctance\nto involve the Union in anything\npolitical. The Union is a service for\nstudents and that's it.\nThe point is underlined by the\nscheme Nigel has been considering\nto rename IC Union IC Students\nConfederation thus avoiding the\npolitical implications of the word\nUnion.\nThe Baker Brothers, Kenneth and\nNigel have more than their names\nin common - as those who listened\nto Nigel drone in ces sent ly at the\nprivate meeting between Kenneth\nBaker and some 'typical IC students'\nearlier this term will testify.\nPerhaps Nigel shares the belief\noften declared by the Secretary of\nState for Education, that students\nshould concentrate on their studies\nnot on politics. It is an odd stance\nfrom someone who ought to realise\nthat real education cannot come\nfrom a text book.\nIt is quite apparent that students\nin the 1980's, if they care about the\nfuture of education and that of their\ncountry m, can no longer afford to\nignore politics.\nNor can the Union claim to be\nlooking after the welfare of the\nstudents it represents when it does\nnot challenge issues such as student\nloans head on.\nIt is very easy to burble about\nbeing 'a responsible Union' whilst\nsitting around and discussing these\nissues at UGM's.

    "content": "On the tube\nWhat is art? This question has bothered a number of eminent and not\nso eminent people and has prompted them to define it, write books about\nit and explain it in metaphysical slang making it yet more inaccessible to\nthe public.\nTill the last century, art was indeed considered as various forms of\nentertainment and pleasure only suitable for the aristocracy. It was not until\nthe Great Wars and the advent of the rule of the masses that the ple bian s became acquainted to art.\nThese days many people define art as whatever appears under that title\nin the national papers. Among the post-yuppie affluent classes of today,\nit is considered chic and sophisticated to talk about these, and a person\nwell-versed in such trivia is bound to attract, in a house party the smiles\nof admiration from the amorous females who will inevitably be reeking\nof Chanel/Knowing and the envy of slick men in their white shirts, Chinos,\nbrogues and braces. (Men read this upside down)\nBut we are mavericks and a group of non-conformists and shall not accept\nthis materialistic definition of Thatcherite British pro pog and a. So let us\nexplore further.\nAcross the globe, art is defined in various manners. The French (whether\nyou think of them as indescribable frogs with their mouths stuffed with\ngarlic and horse meant and their hands stained with virgins' blood, or worse)\nnevertheless perfected the art of conversation in the Parisian cafes of the\nnineteenth century, until an eccentric Scotsman came along and invented\nthe television (after which must have been published a pompous little book,\nprobably called 'The Television and the Empire').\nIn pre-AIDS India (2000 B.C.), love-making and sex (they are not the same)\nwere considered to be art forms. And sexist as it may sound, the KamaSutra\nindulges in at least sixty ways on how to be a good wife. The closing\nchapters deal with male sexuality and are a must reading for people out\nto try the exotic.\nThe Japanese (kimono-wearing Lillipudians who never stop bowing when\nmeeting strangers on the tube) cultivate the tea-ce re money as an art. Killing\nan opponent in sword-combat is also a hight ly regarded (but less often\npracticed) form of art.\nIn Europe and Persia, painting, poetry, literature and music have come\nunder this heading.\nBut in essence, an activity which a person pursues in leisure and is a source of pleasure can be regarded as art. Though how you interpret this\ndefinition is another matter.\nUnder this generous label, we shall regularly be discussing art forms\nin Felix-On the Tube.\nThe most imp rot ant thing we need is feedback from the readers. So of\nyou want to write, be creative and give it a try.\nOnce a good friend of mine wrote to the 'Times' editor and disclosed\nhis rather biased views about the Gulf war. He had hoped that Britain being\na free land where everybody has the right to free speech, his letter would\nbe published soon. A few days later, the editor's secretary wort e back, '...the\nEditor regrets that he was unable to publish it...'.\nThe reason I tell you this story is that this sort of thing will not happen\nto you. So get in touch.\nHow to get in touch:\n1.Visit us in the cosy and comfortable interiors of the Felix office where\nprevails an atmosphere of leisure (and abandon) and everybody drinks\nMerrydown Cider.\n2. Drop me a note via the pigeon holes.\nwhat is art ?\na sentimental journey\nI wrote the following piece of surrealistic writing in April 1988. On the\n31st of July, it was broadcasted by Buerger Radio Berlin in a program on\nnon-linear art.\nThe Prince riding on his horse came closer to Samarkand. Dusk was falling\nrapidly and he had to be at the palace before nightfall. The rao d was dusty\nand only occasionally but blissfully provided with an oasis or a water-well.\nThe landscape was typical Transoxanian, arid and barren. The sacred Amu\nDarya flowed further North and this region of the Silk route between\nBokhara and Kashgar was not green. Sometimes the hills near the Caspian\nwere visible too, a place so dreaded by travellers because it was in these\nmountains that a paradise existed, the pleasures of which were only for\na fanatical class of as s as in s, the Hashisheen.\nThe Prince was born In Nishapur. He was a contemporary of Omar\nKhayyam. He had the fortune to live his youth in a rather colourful part\nof the Moslem Empire. By the age of fourteen he was adept at sword fighting\nand reading Latin. He was a handsome young man with a strong Caucasian\nface, dark brown eyes and flowing black hair. The Persian women, so proud\nof their own beauty used to gaze at him hapless ly from behind their veils.\nHis adventures had led him so far to the forbidden gardens of the Nizam\nof Badakhshan, where he secretly made passionate love to the Nizam's seventeen year old daughter. His days were carefree, spent either drinking\ngrape wine with Khayyam or talking to the old man in the mountain about\nAstrology, Alchemy and Philosophy,\n(continued)\nEmile Nizan\nElec.
