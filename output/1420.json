Annabel Slater gives her verdict on last term\u2019s festivities\nT\nhe Imperial Christmas\nBall promised free mulled\nwine, mince pies, sexy\nelves, merry DJs, and\ngeneral festive fun for the\nprice of 9 pounds. Did it deliver? It\nmostly did, after a slow start.\nThe face of the Union\u2019s main building was emblazoned with screened\nsnowflake shapes, but beyond that, the\nground floor hosted little Christmassy\nglitz. Pumping music played and gaudy\nlights flickered over a conspicuously\nempty dance room, and most Ball attendants were packed into and tanking\nup in the bar.\nThe Ball\u2019s main theme attractions\nwere clustered in the concert room\nupstairs where free popcorn, chocolate\nand candy floss stalls stood along one\nwall, a tiny twinkling grotto sat in the\ncorner, and a bucking reindeer-bronco\npit took up the rest of the room\u2019s space.\nLights hung over the stage, snowflake\nshapes strobed, and ambient music\nplayed, but there was still only a smallish collection of people and most either\nmilled uncertainly in the limited space\nof the aisle or stood looking at the still\nunanswered challenge of the reindeer\nbronco with its glowering controls\nman. Two massive, glossy chocolate\nfountains offered diversions for the\ngluttonous and hosted a range of cookie bits and confectionary which could\nbe stabbed with skewers and drowned\nin thick liquid deliciousness. My boyfriend eagerly hunted the crowd for the\npromised sexy elves, and we were not\ndisappointed when a tall man in clinging scarlet tights and a sleekly small elf\noutfit strolled past. Mince pies were\ncirculating in abundance but sadly\nmulled wine wasn\u2019t, due to a sugar and\nsalt mix up, and\u2026 well, free alcohol\nwas currently off the cards, which was\nalso why the bar was so busy.\nIt would have been nice to have the\nattractions of the Ball spread out over\na wider area of the Union, or to have\na seating area alongside the food stalls\nfor better mingling and chat, but really\nfor a student-led event, it was a good\neffort. Sure enough, as the twinkling\nlights, ambient music and masses of\nfree sugar took effect, people began\ntackling the reindeer and the Ball took\non a livelier air.\nSanta stayed manfully in his grotto,\nposing for photos, the mulled wine\neventually reappeared and good vibes\nwere overflowing. After the concert\nhall closed at midnight, the night continued with the dance room packed\nfull of festive revellers bopping along\nto pop, or sprawling happily outside\nwith barbecued hotdogs and burgers.\nIt was a modest affair, modestly priced,\nand a merry time.\nChristmas Ball\n19th December\nHHHHI\nThe Union\nPrice: \u00a39\nT\nhe space between Christmas and New Year\u2019s Eve\ncan be a somewhat surreal\ntime. Recovering from\nwhatever joys (or horrors)\nChristmas has brought the days often\nseem to meld in to one as you prepare\nyourself for another new year.\nFortunately for some it was in to\nthis festive haze that Durrr at The End\nstepped, perfectly timing its \u2018Not NYE\nParty\u2019 on 29th December to allow for\nover 24 hours of recuperation before\nnew year\u2019s celebrations began.\nAfter adjusting to being back in central London with a few cocktails we\nheaded off to the End. Hidden round\nthe corner of West Central Street we\nfollow the queue round to the entrance,\ndown the stairs, and out of the cold.\nWith a bar to my right, dance floor to\nmy left, and night with Peaches and\n\u201cSpecial Guest DJ\u201d lined up I\u2019m thinking I can\u2019t go wrong. Until I realise I\nhave to go back up to the freezing cold\nentrance to use the cloakroom.\nAlthough this is not a great design\nit is a good way of checking out what\nthe mix of people out tonight is like.\nKnown as the End\u2019s alternative/indie\nnight, it\u2019s not too surprising to see\nmore than a few outfits at Durrr that\nlook suspiciously like a hand-knitted\nChristmas present from grandma\npaired with leggings. However, by the\ntime our coats are out of the way a fairly mixed crowd has gathered, the bar\nis already 5 people deep, and a great\natmosphere is building.\nFor those who haven\u2019t made it to the\nEnd yet (and if you\u2019re planning hurry\nas it closes the 24th January!) the club\nconsists of two rooms with an entrance\nspace between and is entirely under-ground. The first room, on the right\nas you enter, features the bar and a\nsmall stage which, at Durrr, has hosted\na huge range of bands including Franz\nFerdinand, Ladyhawke and Foals.\nThe second room is essentially a\nhuge cellar with a DJ booth at one end.\nWith arched ceilings and strategically\nplaced seating in the darker corners it\u2019s\njust the right size to fill with music and\nlights, whilst still giving the impression\nof a small room where you can be stood\nnext to the DJ the whole night.\nThe dance floor slowly fills up, with\na mix of indie and electro playing, un-Not New Years Eve; it\u2019s The End\nKatherine Goates reviews Durrr@The End, before the club closes its doors for the final time this month\ntil tonight\u2019s main feature, Peaches, appears in the DJ booth. The last time I\nsaw Peaches she was rubbing her pink\nsparkly ensemble against a Reading\nFestival crowd, so I (and most of the\ncrowd) can probably be forgiven for\nspending the first 20 minutes of her\nset trying to ascertain what she was\nwearing. Unfortunately her curly, half-bleached Mohican and two piece with\nleather fringes reaching the floor was\nprobably more inspiring than her DJ\nset. Keeping the pace up and throwing\nin crowd pleasers from Santogold and\nMGMT it\u2019s a good set but seemed to\nlack the smooth finish of the rest of the\nnight.\nI would, however, hazard a guess\nthat my view of Peaches\u2019 set is slightly\ntainted by the fact that a while later\nthe \u201cSpecial Guest DJ\u201d turns out to\nbe Erol \u201cKing of Electo\u201d Alkan. The\nphrase \u201cmaster at work\u201d seems fairly\napt at this point. The room is completely packed and various characters\nare dancing along the edges of the\nDJ booth flailing limbs (and more) at\nthe equally entranced crowd. Effortlessly delivering a set blending his own\nremixes with standard anthems like\nRock the Casbah and a whole load of\nother great music it\u2019s not until the end\nof Erol\u2019s set until people seem to even\ncontemplate leaving (and then I\u2019m fairly sure a lot of them were carried out),\nfrankly New Year\u2019s Eve can wait when\nit\u2019s \u2018Not NYE\u2019.\nWIN 2 FREE\nTICKETS TO MYLO,\nANDY C AND\nNABOO AT FABRIC\nChristmas might\nbe over, but felix\nis still giving away\npresents.

Although a majority of Council\nmembers supported the motion, voting 20 for and 12 against, the motion\ndid not reach the required two-thirds\nmajority.\nCriticisms of the paper came thick\nand fast as Council members took offence at what they perceived to be a\npoorly written and poorly prepared\npaper. Council members were not reassured when Jenny Morgan admitted that she had not had the time to\nwrite up the proposal properly, as she\nwas unwell, and that what was submitted was essentially a rough draft.\nThe question of funding was raised\nand there was some concern that the\nproposals didn\u2019t mention where funding would be sourced. Jenny Morgan\nresponded by telling Council that she\nknew that many high-ranking College\nstaff supported the move to increase\nstudent representation, including the\nRector, Sir Roy Anderson.\nThe motion was supported by\nDPEW Hannah Theodorou who argued strongly that the motivation for\nthe new roles was the large workload\nassociated with her position. With\nthese new positions, she argued, there\nwould be more time to actively engage\nwith the student body rather than being bogged down with meeting after\nmeeting.\nThe DPEW and the President were\nunited on the proposal with Deputy\nPresident Clubs and Societies Lily\nTopham remaining mostly silent\nthroughout Council. However a clear\nsplit emerged when Deputy President\nFinance and Services Christian Carter\ndramatically attacked the proposal\nclaiming that his job had a similar\nworkload to the DPEW. He accused\nthe President of trying to rush an unprepared motion through Council and\nwarned that if the College did not provide funding for the position then the\nUnion would be forced to divert money away from clubs and societies.\nChristian Carter received support\nfrom the Faculty Union Presidents who\nclaimed that some welfare responsibilities could be transferred to the faculty level away from the central union.\nDPEW Hannah Theodorou dismissed\nthis notion, arguing that the faculty\nunions did not carry enough weight\nto effectively represent students to\nthe college or outside of university on\ncomplicated welfare issues.\nConsternation eventually gave way\nto fatigue as discussions continued\ninto their third hour despite some efforts to end debate of the issue; one\ncouncil member was strongly reprimanded by the Council Chair for calling the debate of the issue \u201cstupid\u201d.\nConfusion about funding remained\nright up to the vote as Jenny Morgan\nstrongly asserted that College would\nprovide funding and Christian Carter\nrebuffed her saying she was gambling\nwith clubs and societies\u2019 funding. The\nDPFS claimed that the Union might be\nleft high and dry by the College even\nif College Council permitted the new\nroles in the knowledge that they would\nbe expected to fund them. He warned\nthat the College might make cuts to the\nsubvention (money the College gives\nto the Union each year \u2013 amounting to\nover 1 million pounds) elsewhere.\nSeveral Medic councillors had to\nleave Council early and therefore a\nvote was called on the motion, which\nwas narrowly defeated.\nDPFS Christian Carter commented\nafter the meeting that there had been\n\u201cno real discussion of the alternatives\nor any professional assessment of\nwhether a new role is needed at all\u201d. He\nlamented what he called \u201cthe manner\nin which the proposers are trying to\nrush through something so important\nwithout consulting those whom it actually affects.\u201d\nSocial Clubs Committees Chair\n(SCC) Peter Mabbott agreed with\nChristian Carter saying that although\n\u201cthe President and DPEW held an open\nmeeting on the subject before Council\u201d\nthat because most Council members\nwere considering the proposal for the\nKadhim Shubber\nDeputy Editor\nImperial Summer Ball\ntickets now on sale, but at an\nincreased price to last year\u2019s\nImperial College London\u2019s Summer\nBall is the largest student ball in London and this year\u2019s Ball will be the big-gest, most lavish and most exciting yet!\nTickets are already on sale for the event\nwhich takes place across our South\nKensington campus and is attended\nby over 2,500 revellers. With great acts\nand DJ\u2019s, a formal dinner, fireworks, a\nfunfair, a casino, marquees, light shows\nand more, the Summer Ball 2009 is the\nnot-to-be-missed event of Imperial\u2019s\ncalendar. Tickets for our formal 600\nseated dinner always sell out fast, so\norganise you and your friends and get\na table together!\nAn Entertainments Ticket offers full\nentry to all the entertainments and acts\non the evening starting from 19:30. A\nDinner and Entertainments Ticket offers all that the Entertainments Ticket\ndoes but with a Champagne Reception\nfrom 17:30 and a four course meal with\nafter-dinner speakers in our lavish\nQueen\u2019s Lawn Marquee.\nThe starting prices for the two tickets are \u00a330 and \u00a365 respectively. The\ncost of the Dinner and Entertainments\nticket has increased by \u00a310 from last\nyear\u2019s price, whilst the Entertainments\nticket has only increased by \u00a35. Some\nstudents have questioned these price\nincreases, which would produce at\nleast an extra \u00a36,000 of revenue for the\norganisers. Deputy President (Finance\n& Services) Christian Carter, who is\nresponsible for the Summer Ball, told\nfelix that \u201cThe costs have increased\n(particularly food prices) and the ticket\nprices had not changed for two years.\nIn order to run an event that does not\nlose money we either have to raise\nprices or cut the standard of the ball.\nThe price increase means that we can\ncontinue to deliver the same quality of\ndinner and the big name acts as has become expected.\u201d\nWhatever the reason, the event is\nsure to be an entertaining one and one\nthat has increased in popularity over\nthe years.\nJovan Nedi\u0107\nEditor in Chief\nDina Ismail\nNews Correspondent\nIt looks like the credit crunch just got a\nwhole lot worse, as this year\u2019s university graduates will be facing the toughest\nbattle for jobs in a generation. Tens of\nthousands could be facing unemployment over the coming months owing\nto the impact of the economic down-turn, with 18-24 year olds bearing the\nbrunt of redundancies.\nMinisters are so concerned that\nthey\u2019ve decided to do something\nabout it, drawing up a rescue package\nto help the class of 2009 find a job or\nacquire new skills when they graduate\nthis summer. They include an internship scheme where students would\nwork at a reduced wage to gain ex-perience. This \u2018National Internship\nScheme\u2019 is currently being backed by\nfour firms, including Barclays and Microsoft. However as job vacancies get\nslashed, major companies and investment banks are narrowing their search\nfor new recruits to a limited number\nof elite universities, mainly Oxford,\nCambridge and, you\u2019ll be glad to hear,\nImperial College (phew!). But make no\nmistake, the competition will be the\nmost brutal it has ever been.\nChief executive of the Association of\nGraduate Recruiters is warning final-year students that a good degree on\nits own is no longer enough \u2013 graduates now need to make themselves-as\nattractive as possible by emphasising-work experience and life skills. \u201cMany\nof this year\u2019s graduates will be in for a\nshock because they have grown up in\nan affluent society, so have become a\nlittle complacent, believing that good\njobs \u2018fall from trees\u2019\u201d, the organisation\nsays.\nSo with employment chances looking bleak, what are the options? Well,\nif slogging your guts out in an internship for the minimum pay doesn\u2019t take\nyour fancy and neither does long-term\nunemployment, then your other option is to go back to summer-holiday\njobs that you thought were well in\nyour student life past. According to\nthe Association of Graduate Recruiters, university-leavers should be prepared to stack shelves or work behind\na bar as the recession bites. However,\neven these unskilled jobs may be hard\nto come by. With past government initiatives of putting 50% of adults into\nhigher education, the labour market\nhas been flooded with degree holders\nfor some time now and so graduates\nbeing forced to take non-graduate jobs\nis not a new trend, it\u2019s just a worsening\none with the recession.\nThe disheartening reality that you\ntoiled your way through university and\nbled your finances dry, only to end up\nwith a job at Tesco will, it appears, be\nshared by many. Experts warn that the\ndemoralising effects of unemployment\non young people could turn into long-term \u201cscarring\u201d if they are out of work\nfor more than a year, making it harder\nto reconnect with stable career jobs\nlater on.\nSo in other words, until things get\nbetter, university-leavers should make\nthe most of any job they can get their\ngraduate hands on because also, don\u2019t\nforget, there\u2019s the small matter of a student loan that needs paying off. Have a\nHappy 2009!\nStudents from Imperial College have\nbeen fined a total of \u00a32,000 for \u201cillegal map-making\u201d in a Chinese province last September. Dr Jian Guo Liu,\na Reader in Remote Sensing from the\nDepartment of Earth Science and Engineering, was on a routine survey in\nthe Xinjiang area with a final year undergraduate and one PhD student.\nDr Liu and the students, who wish\nto remain anonymous, were invited by\nthe Institute of Crustal Dynamics, part\nof the China Seismological Bureau, to\ncarry out earthquake fault research in\nthe Chinese areas of Aksu and Keping.\nThe Aksu area itself is one of the tensest areas in Xinjiang, where many of\nthe local Muslim Uighur population\nare hostile to Chinese rule. A series of\nlethal attacks in Xinjiang were ascribed\nto separatist terrorist groups during the\nsummer, particularly just in advance of\nthe Beijing Olympics.\nDue to the Olympics taking place,\nthe usual method of obtaining paperwork was severely delayed, which is\nwhy the group obtained a visa through\nan invitation from the China Seismological Bureau.\nThe tension in the area and the presence of foreign scientists on Chinese\nsoil could have been one of the reasons\nfor the crackdown, it apparently being\nillegal to carry out any scientific work\nwithout the correct paperwork, as it is\nconsidered a threat to state security.\nThe Aksu Land and Resource Bureau\naccepted that the students had an \u201cinnocent explanation\u201d in a statement released on the 5th January 2009, but that\nthey had collected \u201cillegal data\u201d from\n6,000 points that were valuable for\nmineral prospecting and topographical research.\nA spokesperson for Imperial College\nLondon said: \u201cThey were investigating a very active fault system which\nis known to have a direct impact on\nearthquakes that have occurred near-by. The project involved collecting information about tectonic plate activity\nto help scientists understand the geological history of the area, which is potentially of use to the local population\nfor earthquake hazard management.\u201d\n\u201cOn 19 September 2008, the Aksu\nBureau of Land and Resources stopped\ntheir geological field work and confiscated their two GPS receivers, surveying results and data. The students\nwere questioned but not arrested and\nno formal charges were made. They\nwere fined RMB 10,000 (approxi-mately \u00a31,000) each. The College has\nreimbursed this cost. On 28 September, research and field equipment was\nreturned to the students. The students\narrived safely back in London on 2\nOctober 2008. Their studies have not\nbeen affected.\u201d\nFined \u00a32,000 for\n\u2018illegal map-making\u2019\nJovan Nedi\u0107\nEditor in Chief\nDr Liu told the Telegraph on the 5th\nJanuary that he had been taking students to the area to study geology for\nnearly 10 years and has never encountered any problems. He said that \u201cWe\nconsidered not going but everything\nwas booked and the study was crucial\nfield work for my student\u2019s PhD.\u201d\nHe insisted that the GPS data the pair\ngathered could not have been used for\nmapping, and that the large volume of\ndata was mostly collected by a previous student who had not cleared it before handing it back.\n\u201cWe agree that they didn\u2019t have the\nproper paperwork but they didn\u2019t\ndo any mapping work,\u201d he said. \u201cThe\nChinese are very sensitive to foreigners working in that region but it\u2019s their\ncountry, what can you do?\u201d He went on\nto say that it would be \u201cvery unlikely\u201d\nthat he will get permission to take any\nstudents back to the area to carry out\nmore work.\nThe mountain range in the Xinjiang region of China, through which the\nold Silk Road passed\nFirework display at last year\u2019s Summer Ball\nPhoto by Ian Gillett\nfirst time it was not the right time to\nvote on the Constitution.

Jim\nCarrey is back on form playing Carl, a\nloan advisor at a bank who is desperately miserable after a rocky divorce\nand so hates his life.\nFinding joy only by renting DVD\u2019s\nand watching them alone, his best\nfriend Peter (Cooper) tries his hardest\nto make him have a social life and enjoy himself. One day at work, Carl runs\ninto an old friend who tells him about\na self-help seminar which commands\npeople to say \u201cyes\u201d to everything they\nare asked. After attending the meeting\nand then running out of petrol as soon\nas he has left it, Carl bumps into Allison (Deschanel), a free-spirited and\neasy-going photographer. After this\nunforgettable encounter, Carl decides\nto become a Yes Man and soon finds\nhimself doing things he wouldn\u2019t normally dream of.\nThe movie is based on a book by English comedian and writer Danny Wallace, who decided to say \u201cyes\u201d to situations he would normally say \u201cno\u201d to for\na year to make his life more interesting.\nThis idea was taken and turned into a\nHollywood film, and very successfully\ntoo, as Yes Man is a hilarious, feel-good\ncomedy that is big on laughs and low\non cheese \u2013 something that this reviewer greatly appreciates.\nJim Carrey gives a great perform-ance, one that is reminiscent of his 90\u2019s\nglory although slightly toned down for\na contemporary audience. The supporting cast are also really likeable and\nfunny: Zooey Deschanel is appealing\nas a sexy but quirky girl-next-door\nleading lady; Bradley Cooper is witty\nand compelling as his best friend and\nNew Zealand comedian Rhys Darby\nalmost steals the show with his geeky\nand hilarious character Norman.\nThe script sparkles and feels original,\nmainly because the dialogue is realistic\nand bubbly and most of the set pieces\nare extremely funny to watch. Some\nof the best moments are completely\nunexpected, for example the opening\nscene in a video rental store, a Harry\nPotter party, Carl\u2019s elderly next door\nneighbour and a fight outside of a bar,\nalthough the overall sarcastic tone\nof the film helps make each joke run\nseamlessly into another.\nIt is not often that I see a film that\nmakes me laugh the whole way\nthrough, especially one that borders on\nchick-flick territory, but Yes Man is a\nwell-plotted and unique film that takes\na funny idea and runs with it.\nWant to chase the blues away this\nyear? Then I recommend kick-start-ing 2009 with this very enjoyable and\nuplifting comedy.

It\nsounds like a good idea and with two\nsexy leads it could be entertaining, especially when the setup is the worse\nnightmare of every, single bride to\nbe \u2013 men take note: if you mess with\nany woman\u2019s wedding, prepare to face\nWAR!\nWARNING: Do not mess with a Bride! That goes double for two brides.\nX-Men Origins: Wolverine\nT\nhe noughties are finally\ncoming to an end- and\nsoon the 10\u2019s will engulf\nus. But fear not! It has\nbeen a very good decade for the film industry: the rise of\nmoney-making, blockbuster, superhero movies and the almost death of\nchick flicks (which have in fact made\na comeback- just look at the Sex and\nthe City movie) has meant that every\nstudio in Hollywood has been desperate to churn out an action/fantasy\nfilm that will guarantee them a big\nmonetary return.\nAlthough some of the most expensive films ever made were created\nthis decade (Spiderman 3 apparently\ncost almost half a billion dollars)\nlow-budget, indie movies have also\nfought through the generic save-the-world plots to triumph \u2013 look at how\nsuccessful films which were shot in\nfront of a green screen were (e.g. 300\nand Sin City), just showing how much\nmodern cinema depends on computer\ngraphics.\nThis decade has also seen sequel after sequel after sequel \u2013 showing that\nwhen you have no other ideas and are\ndetermined not to take risks, putting\nyour eggs in one basket can in fact pay\noff. But this year, the final year of the\nnaughtiest decade ever, we continue\nto have the kind of movies that have\ndefined the 00\u2019s: remakes, reboots\nand sequels.\nThe horror genre has always been\nknown for remaking every idea it\nhas ever had, whether they have been\ngood or bad, but this year we will see\nthe new \u2018in thing\u2019 in Hollywood: 3D!\nKicking off with My Bloody Valentine:\n3D in January and finishing the year\nin Final Destination 3D (the fourth\ninstallment of the popular franchise),\naudiences should prepare themselves\nfor flying pickaxes, car tyres, severed\nheads and gore hurling themselves\nat the screen in order to shock and\ndelight.\nThe list of sequels this year include\nboth good and bad franchises: we will\nbe bored to death in Harry Potter 6\nAnd The Who Really Gives A Crap,\nconfused and worried that Transformers: Revenge Of The Fallen ever\ngot made, chilled in Ice Age: Dawn Of\nThe Dinosaurs and possibly thrilled\nin Fast and Furious, which reunites\nPaul Walker and Vin Diesel.\nAt a time when everyone is depressed and vulnerable, serious dramas are also making an (un)happy\nreturn to our screens: Will Smith will\ndelight and depress in Seven Pounds,\nKate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio\nwill captivate in Revolutionary Road,\nBrad Pitt will be bland and boring in\nThe Curious Case of Benjamin Button\nand if you want an ensemble rom-com then make sure you watch Jennifer Aniston lead an all-star cast in\nHe\u2019s Just Not That Into You.\nYou may think that comic book\nadaptations have dried up but apparently they haven\u2019t, with both Watchmen and X-Men spin-off X-Men Origins: Wolverine on the horizon. Will\nthey both live up to the hype? Let us\nhope so, as they both look like they\ncould be good but probably won\u2019t be.\nAnother highly anticipated film this\nyear is the sequel/reboot of the popular Terminator series- Terminator:\nSalvation. As it stars Christian Bale\nit is sure to be a box-office smash,\nhowever Arnie will not be making an\nappearance. Let\u2019s just hope it is more\nT2 then the dreadful T3. Another se-quel/reboot that is filling chat-rooms\nand blogs with debate is Star Trek.\nCan it impress the die-hard Trekkies?\nSeems like filmmakers are catering to\ncyberspace fan-boys this year, trying\nas hard as they can to cash in on successful cult franchises.\nMore semi-original ideas also\nabound this year, as recently divorced\nGuy Ritchie directs Robert Downey Jr\nin Sherlock Holmes. Hollywood tries\nto tackle hit Japanese cartoon series\nDragonball Z with Dragonball: Evolution starring a young American as\nGoku, something many fans will be\nseething about; children\u2019s favourite\nWhere The Wild Things Are will finally be released after years of production problems; and Pixar will provide\nanother sterling computer animation\nwith Monsters vs. Aliens.\nWill it be a good year for movies?\nThis film fan thinks it will be a year of\nhits and misses, something that this\ndecade has been all about. But I will\nride the 00\u2019s out in style, by trying as\nhard as possible to fit in as many films\nthis year as humanly possible.

With six competitions spread across three days this is a\nbig event in the club calendar and this\nyear was no exception with our biggest\nentry to date.\nThe first events of the day (Friday)\nwere the women\u2019s sabre and the men\u2019s\nepee, in which we had eight fencers\ncompeting: Joan Chang, Clare Harding\nand Beth Jelfs, Marcello Colombino,\nAlessandro Costamagna, Ed Collier,\nEd Gilhead and Chris Namih.\nThe women\u2019s sabre went smooth\nwith all three girls making the last 16\nbefore being knocked out by the eventual gold, silver and bronze medallists.\nMarcello made it to the final in the\nmen\u2019s epee, where he lost, to gain the\nsilver medal. He faced the same opponent who also knocked out last year\u2019s\nbronze medallist Alessandro, who\nfinished 20th. Not that Marcello\u2019s run\nwas without complications, early on he\nknocked out his own team captain, an\nunwell Ed G. and confusion at the end\nof one round left Marcello convinced\nthat he had lost a bout on the final\nhit. It took some time for Marcello to\nbe convinced that he had in fact won\nand could go back to stocking up on\nbananas before the next round (most\npeople thought 12 in one competition\nwas a little excessive, but maybe that\u2019s\nthe key to his success). Ed C. and Chris\nboth put in good performances with\nEd making the last 32 and Chris getting knocked out in the last 64.\nSaturday saw the women\u2019s epee with\nthe men\u2019s foil taking place. Joan and\nBeth were joined by the women\u2019s team\ncaptain Emily Bottle and fresher Helen\nPennington. Joan made it to the last 32,\nfinishing 29th whilst everyone else got\nknocked out in the last 64.\nFor the men Ed C. and Chris N. were\nboth fencing again, along with Indy\nLeclercq, Chris Gilliam, Alex Bishop\nand Nathan Harmston. With the large\namount of competitors, everyone was\nranked lower than hoped for, with Indy\nranked 5th despite having won all of\nhis bouts. This left Chris N. and Nathan playing off to reach the 128, luckily\nboth won their bouts easily to make it\nthrough where they finished the day,\nalong with Alex. Chris G. and Ed made\nit through to the last 64 and Indy narrowly missed out on a place in the last\n16, finishing 17th overall.\nNottingham university organised a\nsocial event in the evening, although\nthose who had to fence the next day\ndecided to leave the rest to it. As ever it\nwas a good night and a great chance to\nsocialise with the rest of the fencers,\nHeathrow expansion\nplans affect IC sports\nNew plans were approved by the government and unveiled to MPs last\nThursday (15th January) to expand\nHeathrow airport by the construction of a third runway complex. Their\nventure is strongly opposed by some\nmembers of the cabinet, over 50 MPs\nwith the Mayor of London, Boris Johnson considering supporting a legal\nchallenge.\nConstruction is due to start in 2015\nand be completed within 5 years; once\ncompleted the operating capacity is\nset to increase from present levels of\n480,000 passengers a year to 702,000\nby 2030. It is feared that when Great\nBritain emerges out of the current economic crisis, Heathrow as it currently\nstands will not be able to fill the needs\nof business traffic and potential foreign\ninvestors, who will consequently take\ntheir business to Great Britain\u2019s main\nEuropean competitors.\nDue to Heathrow constantly operating at almost 100% capacity, minor\nproblems stack up throughout the day,\ncausing significant delays. Reducing\nthe level of working capacity by building a third runway will not only solve\nthis issue, but create hundreds jobs\nwhich will help contribute to the estimated \u00a37bn to the economy each year.\nTo make way for the new runway, an\narea spanning about 700 homes and\nbusinesses will have to be demolished\nwhich includes Heathrow Primary\nSchool. Perhaps more importantly\nfor Imperial\u2019s sporting body, Harlington Sports Ground will also suffer the\nwrecking ball.\nAlthough Harlington is on the very\nedge of the area proposed for devel-opment, only the artificial pitches lie\noutside. Sport Imperial state that they\nhave known about this eventuality\nfor some years and have already purchased land in Norwood Green, which\nis ready for the full development of a\nnew sports complex. As a result Sport\nImperial can assure students that they\nwill not be affected and there will be\nfacilities for sportsmen and women to\nplay matches and train on.\nNeil Mosley, head of Sport Imperial\ntold felix that \u201csport at Imperial will\nnot suffer as a result of the Heathrow\nexpansion and we are in talks with the\nLondon Borough of Ealing to develop a\nnew sports facility.\u201d An added bonus is\nthat the new grounds are situated closer to the campus than the current ones\navailable at Harlington, allowing sports\nteams to train with increased regularity on real pitches. The pitches used by\nthe Medical School teams at Teddington will remain unaffected and still be\nretained by college for the Medicals.\nMany environmental groups strongly\noppose the idea citing that both noise\nand air pollution will be dramatically\nincreased as a result of the expansion,\nwhich they say will ruin the lives of\nresidents who live under the new flight\npath which will run almost directly\nContinued on page 26\nBeth Jelfs\nCharles Murdoch\nContinued on page 27\nImperial fencers strike\ngold in Nottingham\n\n"

You\nfeel tempted to boogie in\nyour seat but the urge is\nnot quite as strong as the\nvibe you got from some of\nSir Tom\u2019s earlier works.\nThe title, and also concluding track, \u201824 Hours\u2019, is oddly\ndisappointing. It is a slow track,\nperfect for demonstrating Jones\u2019\nfrothy vocals, but he has not taken\nthe opportunity to do so, hence the\nsong collapses into three unrelated\nlayers of vocals (good), instrumental\nsection (good), and percussion (good).\nPut together they sound less good.\nWhat amused me more than the title\ntrack was a little mid-table track called\n\u2018Sugar Daddy\u2019. Maybe it was because\nthis is one of the tracks where Sir Tom\u2019s\niconic voice DOES shine through confidently with lots of oomph. Maybe it\nis because it has exceptionally catchy\nphrases. Maybe it is because he shouts\n\u201cOOOOOOOOOOOOOWWW\nHOLY SCHMOLEY\u201d in the middle of\nthe song.\nOverall, I feel that the upbeat tracks\nfar overshadow the ballads.

Sir Tom has\nestablished himself with a musical career that took off before the first moon\nlanding. The new album, 24 Hours, is\ndescribed as a record that is \u201cintimate,\npersonal, moving and full of fire\u201d, and\nmore decorated with the singer\u2019s own\ncomposing skills than any of his previous albums.\nJia-Ou Song\nWhat\u2019s New, Sir Tom Jones?\n:LISTINGS::LISTINGS::LISTINGS::LISTINGS::\nFriday Monday\nTuesday\nNGS::LISTIN\nChase and Status :: Fabric ::\nDrum n Bas\nDenise :: Lyric :: Indie\nFriendly Fires :: Matter ::\nElectronica\nNatalie Williams :: Ronnie\nScotts Jazz Club :: Soul\nCindytalk :: The Macbeth ::\nExperimental\nBenga + Skream + DJ Zinc +\nmore :: The End :: Dubstep/\nDrum n bass\nMandy Patinkin :: Duke of York\u2019s\nTheatre :: Classical\nArmstrong :: The Fly :: Indie\nFaster Pussycat + Bang Tango ::\nThe Underworld :: Metal\nDelta Spirit :: Water Rats :: Indie\nDuke Special :: Proud Galleries ::\n\u2018Vaudeville\u2019, apparently\nFranz Ferdinand :: Heaven :: Indie\nWallis Bird :: Soho Revue Bar ::\nAcoustic\nRingworm + Kingdom :: The\nUnderworld :: Hardcore\nAstor Piazzolla :: Barbican Centre\n:: Nuevo Tango\nSaturday\nRebekah :: Egg :: Folk\nHostage Life :: Embassy :: Punk\nLuke Slater :: Fabric :: Techno\nDenise :: Lyric :: Indie\nSunday\nDenise :: Lyric :: Indie\nKing Roc :: The End :: Electro\nLymbyc System :: Barfly :: Electro\nWednesday\nQuietdrive :: Barfly :: Rock\nThursday\nSaltPeter :: Cross Kings :: Break\nBreat\nTo-Mera :: Electric Ballroom ::\nProgressive Metal\nSka Cubano :: Jazz Cafe :: Ska\nUgly Duckling + Imperial Leusire\n:: Scala :: Hip-hop and punk\nrespectively\nWinterKids :: The Lexington ::\nRock\nNatalie Williams :: Ronnie Scotts\nJazz Club :: Soul\nAcoustic Ladyland :: The\nBorderline :: Jazz\nJoJo De Freq :: The End :: Dance\nEarl Okin :: The Grand :: Jazz\nThe Loose Cannons :: The Social\n:: House\nTony Kofi :: Vortex :: Jazz\nBurial :: Purple Turtle :: Dubstep\nUgly Duckling :: The Firestation ::\nhip-hop\nKap Bambino :: The Macbeth ::\nElectronica\nJustice :: The End :: Electro\nLady GaGa :: Heaven ::\nDancepop/electronica\nWire :: Cargo :: Punk\nWallis Bird :: Soho Revue Bar ::\nAcoustic\nElena :: The Dome :: World\nIt Hugs Back :: The Wallington\nArms:: Punk-pop\nThe record opens nicely with the aptly named\n\u2018I\u2019m alive\u2019. This is as\nTom Jones-y as it gets.\nDrums, then bass, an\nenormous trumpet\ncrescendo, followed\nby Sir Tom belting out\n\u201cI\u2019M ALIVE!\u201d Brilliant.\nWe are getting into the\ngroove. The first sin-gle, \u2018If he should ever\nleave you\u2019, is the second\ntrack and rings out with\na laid-back, retro tune; lots\nof string elements with a\nnice trumpet solo in the\nbass,\nlots\nof trumpets and a big voice\ntogether makes it all the more excit-ing. The slow numbers, albeit more\npersonable and with more occasions to\nhold sustained notes, do not hold ones\nattention as well.\nThis album is principally produced\nby drum \u2018n\u2019 bass company Future Cut,\nwho also work with Lily Allen, Dizzee\nRascal, Estelle and Kate Nash. They\nhave indeed managed to mix Jones\u2019 old\ncinematic styles with currently fashionable sounds and made this new album really quite enjoyable, and it was\na very long time ago since I said that\nabout a new record from somebody\nas young as 68. However, you need to\ngive it a few run-throughs before some\nsongs start to grown on you. As for me,\nI will stick to the upbeat tracks.\nWhen I first heard of Fat Freddy\u2019s\nDrop, I had no clue who they were. After just a few searches, I was convinced\nby their renowned live performances,\ntheir melodious reggae-soul rhythms\nand their BBC\u2019s Worldwide Album of\nthe Year award in 2005, that this show\nwould be a great evening. The seven-piece ensemble originating from New\nZealand first got known through their\ngigs in native Wellington and their independent singles releases, but made it\nbig in 2005 with their first and only album Based on a True Story, from which\nwas released the hit single \u2018Wandering\nEye\u2019. While they qualify themselves as\nhi-tek soul, it sounds more like a modern reggae beat with a drop of dub and\nsoul with some skanking funk here and\nthere. This overall gives a very interesting fusion of sounds, topped off by\nsinger Joe Dukie\u2019s very cool soul lyrics.\nJust think of the evolutionary contemporary of Toots and the Maytals. Last\nFriday\u2019s show at Camden\u2019s Roundhouse\nwas promising - it was the last concert\nof their 2008 Europe tour, after which\nthey left back to the Southern Hemisphere for God knows how long. Thus,\nmany were hoping for an electrifying\nperformance, with maybe some new\nsongs on the way?\nThe first part was well assumed by\nAruba Red, an emerging female singer\nwho mixed acoustic soul and reggae,\nwith a heavy Caribbean influence (who\ncould have guessed with that name)...\nHer lyrics are more political than Fat\nFreddy\u2019s Drop\u2019s, and not everyone had\nan ear for her that night as most were\nexcitingly awaiting the Kiwis. Still, the\naudience was warmed up nicely after-words, and she left the stage to enthusiastic applause. But was it more about\nher performance or\nabout the\nnext band finally coming in?\nAfter a somewhat\nlengthy set-up, Fat Freddy\u2019s\nDrop made their appearance on stage\naccompanied by the ecstatic screams\nof the crowd. Sadly, truth be told, the\noverall show was not quite up to the\nexpectations.\nThey started with a smooth piece\nto ease us in, but unfortunately continued on that rhythm for most of the\nevening. The show was full of ups and\nFat Freddy\u2019s mediocre drop\nat Camden Roundhouse\ndowns as the band went from mellow\nreggae to quicker dub beats and then\nback to almost-ballads, but we did not\nget much of the spontaneous jazzy ska\nimprovisation they are know for in\ntheir live performances. The last cherry to top the sundae of discontent: they\ndid not play their major hit \u2018Wandering Eye\u2019. The \u201cencores\u201d still resound in\nmy ears along with gentle weeps from\nsome fans who came especially to experience that song live.\nStill, all members are extremely\ngifted and at the peak of their art, as\ndemonstrated by the solos from each\nof the six instruments: saxophone,\ntrumpet, trombone, keyboard (also the\nresident DJ), drums and guitar. These\nsolely instrumental intervals were very\ninteresting but sometimes did last a\nlittle too long and failed to entertain\nthe audience for their entire duration.\nWhat the hell, there was hot cider at\nthe bar! Also against this, it has to be\nsaid that the location itself is to blame:\nFat Freddy\u2019s Drop\u2019s slow but melodious\npieces lost a lot of their magic in the\nlarge capacity amphitheater, enough to\nfit nearly 2000 people, but can be easily be imagined as being unforgettable\non the stage of a smaller and more intimate venue. Or on a beach side in New\nZealand (or even Aruba)\u2026?\nIn brief, the band fell a little short\nof what we wanted to hear, but that\ndoes not take anything away from the\nimmense musical talent of the band,\nthe smoothness of their tracks, and\nthe good lyrics and looks of their lead\nsinger. Fat Freddy\u2019s Drop is definitely\na band to discover and a must-have in\nyour music library; I will be waiting for\na new album impatiently, hoping next\ntime they come around it will be in a\nmore appropriate setting.\nEmilie Beauchamp\n\u201cThe \u2018encores\u2019\nstill resound in\nmy hears, along\nwith gentle\nweeps from\nsome of the\nfans\u201d\nFresh sounds for 2k9\nAlexandra Ashford comments on this year\u2019s musical prospects.\nCheck out our playlist at www.8tracks.com/musicfelix to listen\nWell here we are, 2009. What\u2019s going to\nbe buzzing from your iPod earphones\nthis year? Will there be a nu-metal re-vival? Will you regret throwing away\nthose Papa Roach CDs? Will Duffy,\nAdele, and all those similar feisty female singers that no-one listens to,\nform a super group managed by Simon Cowell? Will Kanye West go even\nfurther with his geek image and team\nup with Aphex Twin? Will Madonna\nfinally retire? Will Amy Winehouse/\nBritney Spears/Pete Doherty finally\ndie/recover/re-invent themselves as\nday-time television presenters? Will\nwe all be able to forget Alphabeat ever\nexisted and breathe a collective sigh\nof relief? Who knows, it\u2019s all pos-sible! Music seems more diverse than\never and great music has been coming\nfrom really leftfield places (Bon Iver\nwas conjured up by a guy holed up in\na log cabin with liver disease). But in\nthe zeitgeist of music publications ev-erywhere, here are my predictions for\nwhat you will be downloading err... legally this year.\nLittle Boots\nThere\u2019s a good chance you are sick\nof hearing about how Little Boots\nis THE sound of 2009, but who can\ndeny the catchiness and dancability\nof \u2018Meddle\u2019. There are already hundreds of remixes of this song. But\nis this kind of electro-pop still what\nwe want to hear? I\u2019m kind of over it\nalready. Named after the Roman em-porer Caligula, hopefully she won\u2019t\nreign tyrannically over the airwaves\nfor too long this year before being as-sassinated. Listen to: Love Kills\nLa Roux\nLast year at a Kistune Maison party\nI spent hours in a bathroom with La\nRoux and I didn\u2019t even know it was\nher, so I never got to embarrass myself telling her how fabulous I think\nshe is. Her music is an electro-pop\ndisco blend that\u2019s less techno-y than\nthat of Little Boots, largely influenced\nby 80s synth-pop bands like the Human League. Her hairstyle is largely\ninfluenced by A Flock Of Seagulls.\nListen to: Quicksand\nMumford & Sons\nI think I have listened to the song\n\u2018Hold On to What You Believe\u2019 about\na hundred times already this year.\nThey are making heartfelt folky,\nbluesy rock and damn, it is good.\nTheir music is like a scene in a\nfilm where the main character\nis sitting around a campfire\nwith people he barely knows\nbut everyone feels like they\u2019ve\nknown each other forever and\nsomeone pulls out a guitar. Suddenly everyone sings songs of\ntheir confessions and heartbreak\nand everyone has a moment togeth-er. Listen to: White Blank Page\na punk-rock Barbie (don\u2019t we already\nhave Pink and Gwen doing that any-way? Have we not learned?). Still, her\nmusic is catchy and if you\u2019re the sort of\nperson who has a D.A.N.C.E. ringtone,\nhas been to TigerTiger, and considers\ncoloured tights daring, you just might\nenjoy it. Listen to: Just Dance\nKiD CuDi\nThe token rapper of this article - I\u2019ve\nonly heard of him because he has\nworked with Kanye. I am not big up\non my hip-hop so I don\u2019t know what\u2019s\nreally fresh in this genre. \u2018Day \u2018N\u2019\nNight\u2019 has quite a pleasing dubstep-influenced rhythm and introspective\nsort of sound \u2013 the sort of song\nthat will be on your iPod but\nnot on the dancefloor (though\nof course this is what\nremixes are for).\nI\u2019m not\nsure\nif\nlurking in Kanye\u2019s\nshadow so closely\nis going to be good\nfor him, though \u2013\naccording to Google\nimage search he\nseems to be trying to pull off\nthe exact\nsame look\n(didn\u2019t\nKanye\njust blend\nLupe\nand Andre3000\u2019s\nstyles any-way?). It\nmay have\nworked for\nKanye as his\nthing, but\nfor everyone\nelse, wearing\nthose shutter shades was like having\na knob drawn on their head. Listen to:\nDay \u2018N\u2019 Night\nHockey\nThis band is really my hot tip for\nthis year. You can tell a really good\nsong when you listen to it and can\u2019t\nbelieve you\u2019ve never heard it before -it sounds like the sort of classic song\nyou carry in your head forever. That\nis the feeling I get from \u2018Song Away\u2019.\nDecades from now, teenagers will be\ndiscovering this song on late night\nradio shows and they will get the exact same feeling. If you ever yearn\nfor the days of yore when the Strokes\nwere the coolest band you knew and\nthe NME was a good place to find\nnew bands, listen to Hockey. Listen\nto: \u201cSong Away\u201d\nShoegaze revivals (Van She, Asobi Seksu, M83, Vivian Girls, etc.)\nIf you have never heard the word\n\u2018shoegaze\u2019 before, here\u2019s a rough sum-mary: layers and layers of fuzzy flang-ing droning guitar riffs. Shoegaze\nstarted in the mid \u201880s and ended in\nthe mid \u201890s, but lots of bands of the\npast year have been referring back to\nthis genre that is often overlooked\noutside of Sophia Coppola movies.\nListen to: Vivian Girls - \u2018Where do\nyou run to?\u2019\nDisco revivals (Hercules and\nLove Affair, In Flagranti,\nHeartbreak, Sally Shapiro, Lindstr\u00f8m, endless others)\nOh, you\u2019re still dancing to Justice and\nMGMT? How very\ntwo-thousand-and-eight. Dance\nmusic DJs have been\ndigging up italo disco\ntreasures from the \u201870s\nand \u201880s and new artists\nhave been emerging who\nare basing their sound on\nthe simple almost na\u00efve\nsounds of decades ago when\npolyphonic synthesizers\nhad only just come about.\nIt is a kick back against\nthe over produced, over\nworked sound of modern\nelectro and a delve into\nguilty pleasures and\nnon-ironic enjoyment of the camp,\nkitsch and dec-adent. Listen\nto: Heartbreak\u2018We\u2019re\nback\u2019.\n\u201cMaybe it\nis because\nhe shouts\n\u2018OOOOOOOWW\nHOLY\nSCHMOLEY\u2019 in\nthe middle of the\nsong.\u201d\nLady GaGa\n\u201cDecades\nfrom now,\nteenagers will\nbe discovering\nthis song on\nlate night radio\nshows\u201d\nLady GaGa\nWho the fuck is Lady GaGa? I\u2019ve seen\nher name in newspapers and magazines but I had never listened to Lady\nGaGa until writing this sentence.\nSeems to be marketed like a \u2018cool\u2019\nversion of Britney/Christina which\nis about as much of an oxymoron as\nLocal heroes from Brixton\u2019s old acid\nhouse scene, the Alabama 3, have been\npurveying a unique brand of pseudo-gospel electronica for the last ten years,\ndespite being almost totally ignored by\nthe mainstream music industry. Still,\nthey sold out the Apollo, albeit to a\ncrowd who were mostly the wrong side\nof middle-age \u2013 perhaps trying to recapture some lost youth. After one of\nthe worst warm-up acts I\u2019ve seen for a\nwhile (fronted by a girl who seemed to\nbe in the unusual situation of singing\nin a band while waiting for her big shot\nin a strip club, rather than the other\nway round), the ringmaster came out\nto introduce the main event...\nThe Alabama 3 have always blown\nhot and cold at their live shows. Sometimes, as at Glastonbury last year, they\ncan be sublime and blew the likes of\nthe Fun Lovin\u2019 Criminals right off the\nstage. This time however, they were\nrubbish. Joined by an aged Mick Jones\nfrom The Clash and a clearly pilled-up\nveteran of the Utah Saints, who jumped\naround telling us how great communism is, they just didn\u2019t have room for\nthe full complement of gospel choir\nand brass section that I\u2019ve seen them\nuse before and had to settle for a keyboard instead. Worse still, the sound\nsystem had no way of coping with the\nfive vocalists they often had performing at once, so each track ran into the\nnext in a fog of repetitive bass lines.\nThe show was saved from 1-star disaster by the remarkable Zoe Devlin,\nthe band\u2019s female vocalist \u2013 a voice like\nmolten gold and the outfit of a fetish\ndancer. Frankly I could listen to her all\nday, although I reckon I could just look\nat her for a substantial portion of one\nas well. Her acoustic rendition of \u2018You\nDon\u2019t Dance To Techno Any More\u2019 deservedly received the biggest audience\nreaction all night, and her dancing\nnearly induced a seizure in the old boy\nsat next to me (who was 72, incidentally \u2013 a strange crowd).\nHer performance aside though, the\nband were mediocre at best \u2013 they\nwheeled out the big guns for the end of\nthe set, but by then I\u2019d totally lost inter-est. I didn\u2019t even bother staying for the\nencore \u2013 \u2018nuff said.\nDuncan Casey\nAlabama 3 live at the Apollo\n\u201cI\nremember back when I\nwas young, we used to\ndownload music for free\nwithout a care in the\nworld.\u201d I hold a match to\nmy pipe and take a puff, then two, and\ngaze wistfully out of the window \u201cIt was\nlike the Wild West and we were the internet cowboys. We obeyed no-one,\ncorralling MP3s with our lasso clicks.\nI\u2019ve got to say, I was quite the virile\ndownloader in my youth... yes sirree.\u201d\nMy voice trails off as I nod my head to\na half-forgotten, grainy 128 kbit/s beat.\nMy grandchildren sit at the foot of my\nrocking chair, incredulous.\nEven now, less than a decade into the\nNapster-induced revolution in the music industry, it seems like nothing but\na beautiful dream that one could, once\nupon a time, download music for free\nand not care about the implications\n\u2013 it never felt illegal. Contrary to the\nextreme and often absurd position of\nbodies such as the RIAA, downloading\na song is clearly not the same as stealing a CD from a shop, and no amount\nof copied musical kilobytes can justify filing multi-million dollar lawsuits\nagainst individuals. If it did anything,\nthis massive and public overreaction\nmerely stalled the inevitable realisation\nthat actually, a grand\u2019s worth of MP3s\ndon\u2019t come for free. Eventually the guilt\ncatches up with you, like the creeping\nsickness of a Sartrean nausea.\nHowever, the problems that the internet can create with its right hand\nit can destroy with its left; a new generation of websites and programs are\nstarting to break into the mainstream\nwhich allow users to stream music online legally and effectively for free. I say\neffectively because the services are often paid for by advertising, but it is a\nsmall price to pay \u2013 the artists get their\ncredit, the users balance their karma,\nand everyone\u2019s a winner. What\u2019s more,\nthese services often utilise the community and connectivity of the internet to\nintroduce new elements into the listening experience.\nA great example of this is a program\ncalled Spotify (available from http://\nwww.spotify.com), which allows users\nto stream songs at the price of an advertisement every 10 songs or so. The\nSpotify database is pretty huge but not\ntotally comprehensive, though personally I think this works to its advantage.\nI\u2019ve discovered dozens of odd remixes\nand collaborations which I wouldn\u2019t\nhave given a chance to before.\nAnother quirky little development\nis the phenomenon of internet mixes.\nPodcasts and the like have been available from big name DJs and various\npeople for years, but websites such\nas 8tracks (http://www.8tracks.com)\nand various others allow users to create their own mini-playlists and share\nthem online with friends and well-wishers at the click of a link. In fact,\nwe at music.felix have embraced this\nwholeheartedly and made one our-selves! You can listen to ours at http://\nwww.8tracks.com/musicfelix - we will\nbe updating this every week or so, so\nbe sure to check back regularly. This\nweek we\u2019ve got a \u2018Music of 2009\u2019 theme\nto go with Alexandra Ashford\u2019s lovely\narticle to the right of this column.\nThe sun is setting on the Wild West\ndays of an uncharted internet. In addition to being legally unacceptable, it\u2019s\nnow becoming socially unacceptable\nto download music for free. Nonetheless, the original ideal on which P2P\ndownloading was founded, that of the\nneed to share great music with friends,\nis alive in the new, more conscious generation of music sharing applications.\n\n"

Internet protocol company NTT Communications\n(NTT Com) made their \u201caroma-emitting digital signage\u201d service available\nto businesses around Japan from last\nSeptember. The service provides businesses with the possibility of enhancing their adverts with custom-made\nscents relevant to the advertised prod-ucts. NTT Com\u2019s tests show that consumers were more likely to visit a shop\nwhen scent adverts were in use. Yasuko\nOka from NTT Com says the scent-en-hanced advertising was \u201cmore effective\ncompared [to non-scent advertising]:\npeople noticed the ad more and were\nmore interested in the products in the\nads. In addition, aroma emitting digital\nsignage makes audiences remember\nthe products more strongly than ads\nwithout aroma.\u201d\nExamples of companies using this\nservice include Shiseido testing a rose\nsmell for use in ads for rose perfume,\na spa using a vanilla smell to sell ice\ncream, and even parking lots using\naromatic ads to wake drivers up.\nAds are used \u201cin company lobbies,\nat supermarkets to attract customers\nto buy food, in public places to get attention and in hotels to make the place\nricher and improve the atmosphere\u201d\nsays Oka. Scents cover an area of up to\n500 cubic metres. When asked whether there are any plans for providing the\nservice to companies outside Japan,\nOka says \u201cWe have many requests but\nnow we are trying to do business in Japan only. We are thinking of providing\nscented ads in other countries in the\nfuture.\u201d\nWould such a service ever take off\nA ship loaded with iron set sail last\nweek to test the viability of ocean fertilisation as a measure against climate\nchange. Heading for the Scotia Sea\nclose to Antarctica, the iron will be\ndumped over an area of 300 sq km to\ncreate a bloom of plankton, in turn\nabsorbing carbon dioxide from the\natmosphere.\nPhyto-plankton, or algae, are given\na growth spurt when fertilised with\niron. The intended algae bloom would\nbe big enough to see from space, and\nwould photosynthesise carbon dioxide\nfrom the surrounding air. The bloom\nshould then sink, permanently locking\nthe greenhouse gas on the ocean floor.\nScientists hope this technique will be\nuseful in the fight to reduce greenhouse gases.\nThe mission, led by a team of German scientists from the Alfred Wegener Institute, has come under fire\nfrom campaign groups including the\nETC. They argue a convention laid\ndown in 2008 by the UN and the International Maritime Organisation has\nbeen breached and worry that effects\non surrounding marine life and ecosystems are unknown.\nThe convention was written after a\ncommercial enterprise named Planktos threatened to dump iron filings off\nthe coast of the Galapagos Islands. The\ncompany intended to sell carbon credits to companies who would pay them\nto reduce their carbon footprint. However the consequences were unknown\nand the amount of carbon dioxide directly removed from the atmosphere\nwould be hard to estimate.\nThe current mission insists it has\nscientific backing from UK, German\nand Indian governments, who all supported the UN convention. They argue\nthe experiment is too small to greatly\naffect biodiversity in the ocean and\nis not for commercial gain. They also\nhope to boost the population of krill,\nwhich feed on plankton. In turn, this\nwould provide nourishment for dwindling fish populations.\nThis ocean fertilisation experiment\nin the US and Europe? Joseph Kaye,\na researcher from Cornell whose\nwork includes applications of digital\nscents, says there is hope for this interesting technology closer to home as\nwell. \u201cI think people are often sceptical of such approaches, and Japan is\ndefinitely more open to perhaps more\nexplicit uses of computerised scent\noutput than either the US or the UK\n\u2013 but in both those markets there is an\nenormous use of fragrances in other\nconsumer products... every time you\nuse soap, shampoo, washing powder,\neat nearly all processed foods, smoke\na cigarette or drink flavoured coffees,\nsomeone has thought about the way\nthat object should smell and designed\nit to smell in a particular way.\nClearly many people think that having things smell a certain way is important and so it seems likely that we will\nmove towards interactive scents. \u201c\nKidney\nResearch\nUK reports a\n5% yearly\nincrease\nin chronic\nkidney\ndisease\nwhilst the\nnumber\nof Americans being\ntreated\nfor kidney failure more than doubled\nover the last two decades.

I\nhope you had a better holiday than the\nIsraelis and Palestinians. Good luck to all who have exams and for God\u2019s sake do better than\nme. So, Gaza. What a pickle. When\nwill this stop? How many people have\nto die before both sides put down their\nweapons and stop hating each other?\nDuring all this there has been very\nlittle support for our big-nosed friends.\nThere are many, many idiotic jerks\nwho are claiming support for Palestine\nbecause it is \u201csubversive\u201d, \u201ccool\u201d or \u201crebellious\u201d. Go to hell.\nIf I were to parade in the streets\nholding my own 24-hour vigil in support of Israel defending itself from a\ncountry intent on indiscriminate death\nand destruction I would probably have\nrather a lot of obscenities yelled at me.\nAll these people who support the Palestinians obviously do not understand\nthe situation.\nHamas were elected as representatives of the people of the Palestinian National Authority. Despite doing\ngreat things for the people in some\nareas \u2013 building schools, hospitals etc\n\u2013 they have been firing rockets into\nIsrael, killing civilians and disrupting ordinary people\u2019s lives. When the\nPalestinian people voted for Hamas, a\nparamilitary organisation, they knew\nthat attacks on Israel were possible if\nnot likely. Hamas\u2019 rockets were sanctioned by the people.\nHowever, Israel have been targeting\nmilitary compounds and strongholds.\nThey must be able to defend them\u201c42 killed after Israeli shell hits UN\nschool in Gaza\u201d. \u201c12 members of family killed in Gaza City air strike\u201d. \u201cDeath\ntoll passed 535\u201d. These are just a few of\nthe headlines I read on the 6th of January 2009, 17.24 GMT.\nLiving on this earth seems to be\ngetting more difficult by the day. Disregarding worldwide poverty, catastrophic diseases, or even the slow environmental meltdown, more topical\nthan anything else today is the scene\nof violence and terror. From the lands\nof Rwanda to those of Palestine, wherever we look, blood seems to be on the\nhorizon.\nIn this article, I want to ask you one\nsimple question: since when have we\nbeen able to justify the indiscriminate\nuse of violence in order to neutralise\nour heartfelt grievances? The answer\nto that, in theory, is simple: never.\nWhen the attacks of 7/7 happened in\nBritain, I remember feeling confused.\nApart from the sheer number of people\ninvolved, and the timing of the attacks\n(during the Gleneagles G8 summit), I\nfound it difficult to rationalise the use\nof violence against innocent people\nwho had nothing to do with the stated\nproblems. Disregarding the bombers\u2019\ngoals, I found it hard to see how people could accept the killing of innocent\npeople. Innocent people had nothing\nto do with it. Their role in whatever\nit was these people had in mind, was\nnonexistent! It was reassuring to see\nthat the majority of the Muslim community felt the same way, being vocal\nin their outright condemnation.\nAlmost four years later however, I\nask the same questions \u2013 why are so\nmany people dying needlessly; people\ncaught up in Gaza, who have no influence on Hamas and can neither direct\nit, nor leave it?\nI asked my friend not too long ago\nabout the most difficult feeling he\nwould have to face in his life. Just as\nI thought he would, he said it was the\nmoment he would have to face the\nloss of his mother: the one person he\ncould always rely on, no matter what;\nthe person who brought him up, cared\nfor him, loved him. In Gaza, this is a\nreality people are having to face every\nday. And in some cases it is worse. One\nman had lost all his family: his wife and\n3 children. He was shown in a news report to be giving his youngest child the\nlast kiss he would ever give him. Imagine that was you; losing your brothers,\nsisters, parents and children. Words\ncould not describe your feelings.\nUnfortunately, this is what is happening in Gaza now.\nI ask: how can the world accept a\njustification for the killing of innocent\npeople by Israel? Killing any innocent\nperson is wrong, no matter who does it\nand who is killed. The perpetrator must\nbe condemned. Why condemned? Because they need to be told that they are\nwrong. When George Bush stands up\nand mentions no faults in Israel in this\nconflict, it makes me think what this\nworld has got to. The most powerful\nleader on Earth is failing to criticize the\nkilling of innocent people.\nSo what about the future? What messages does this send out to the world\nand its youth?\nQuite simply, it is this: because Israel\nis allowed to get away with the killing\nof innocent people, the general principle of killing innocent people can be\naccepted so long as the right grievances are cited. So long as you can justify\nyourself, be that the protection of your\nfamily or the protection of your peo-ple, you can kill innocent people.\nThe Muslim community has seen\nIsraeli tanks preparing for an increase in hostilities with Palestine\nJames Goldsack\nPolitics Editor\nselves, especially given their fragile\nposition; the other neighbouring countries have hardly been best friends with\nIsrael through the years.\nI am not a blood-thirsty, war-mon-gering twat, though many of you will\nprobably now believe that I am. In\nmy defense, I believe that neither side\nshould be fighting and that a ceasefire\nmust be established to stop the deaths\nof Israeli and Palestinian civilians and\nsoldiers.\nThe fighting has gone on long\nenough and the Palestinians and their\nsupporters must accept blame in this\nconflict, put their hands up and admit\nwrong-doing. And so must Israel and\nany member of the international community who has had a hand in the continuation of the conflict in the area.\nDiplomatic efforts must be resumed\nto ensure there is peace and everyone\ncan live together without the fear of\ndeath hanging over every day of their\nlives. This applies to both sides.\nIt was encouraging to read that David\nMilliband has declared that the \u201cwar on\nterror\u201d was a \u201cmistake\u201d and that it has\njust made our position worse by unifying the terrorists against the west. One\nhas to wonder whether it was President\nBush\u2019s plan so that the military business in the USA could continue to be\nstrong or whether it was his stupidity\nand lack of foresight. With his poodle\nTony Blair trotting by his side, he managed to worse a situation to the point\nof our own human rights being taken\naway from us both here and especially\nin the US. I cannot wait for Obama to\nbe sworn in so we can rid ourselves\nonce and for all of the Bush years.\nWhy so much\nconflict?\nmany acts of indiscriminate violence\ncommitted in its name, and every time,\nit has been straight in its condemnation\nof such acts: \u2018Indian Muslims condemn\nterrorism\u2019; \u2018Islam expressly condemns\nthe use of violence against civilians\nand innocents\u2019. There are many more\nexamples of these.\nWith the developments going on in\nIsrael, the only statement we hear on\na daily basis is that of the world condemning the killing of innocent Israelis\nby Hamas, and its firing of its rockets.\nI want to know why aren\u2019t the Jews\ncondemning the killing of innocent\nPalestinians by the Israelis? It is being done in their name. Muslims have\ncondemned the killing of innocent ci-vilians, the world over. With the same\nbreath, the Jews should be doing the\nsame \u2013 not because the Muslims are\ndoing it, but because it\u2019s wrong to kill\ninnocent people.\nI leave you with one final thought.\nThe people of the world are speaking\nout. It is taking a long time, but it is\ncoming. More and more pressure has\nto be put up against the idea of killing\ninnocent people. It is wrong, regardless of who does it, why it is done, and\nwho it is done against.\nKatya-yani Vyas\nPolitics Editor\nA scene in Palestine portraying the destruction caused by Israel\u2019s retaliatory bombings,\nObadah Ghannam\nAmidst the myriad of news stories this\nweek, the great majority of them have\nbeen dedicated to the ongoing conflict\nin Gaza. It would be unfair, I feel, to\nforce-feed you yet another one, perhaps a small break is needed from the\ncontroversy and debate that the situation is steeped in.\nHowever we shall stay on the theme\nof controversy, and turn our attentions to Brussels and the recent hoax\nartwork put on display in the Council\nBuilding.\nThe Czech government has been\nforced to apologise to some members\nof the EU having commissioned some\nartwork that humorously lampoons\nsome, occasionally rather sensitive, national stereotypes. The whole debacle\nstemmed from the tradition that the\nEU presidency offers artwork for display in Brussels.\nThe current presidency invited\nan artist from each member state to\nrender something they thought was an\narchetypal quality of their nation, with\nthe notion of breaking down prejudicial barriers.\nThe Czech Republic was under the\nimpression that it had commissioned\nwork from 27 European artists for the\nEntropa display, which was installed\nat the weekend to mark the start of its\nsix-month presidency.\nIn reality the mosaic was designed\nand put together by David Cerny, a\nCzech artist, and two associates. Cerny\nadmits that he misled officials over\nthe project and has commented that\nhe simply wanted to observe the reaction of Europe to the piece, to discover\nwhether Europe is able to laugh at it-self. He pointed out that the display\nwas carried out under the assumption\nthat Europe\u2019s supposed ability to embrace satire was prevalent.\nApparently this is not the case in\nsome countries. The Czech presidency\nhas apologised to Bulgaria over the\n\u2018highly offensive\u2019 portrayal of the country as a toilet.\nAmongst the plethora of depictions,\nItaly is a giant football pitch, France is\nsuspended in a perpetual strike, Germany manifests itself as a number of\nautobahns, the Polish are portrayed\nas a group of priests heaving at a gay\npride flag. The UK is absent from the\ndisplay, no doubt a swipe at our eurosceptic nature. Will Europe be able to\nembrace the humour? I do hope so.\nThe art of controversy...\nViolence cannot be justified\n\n"

It\u2019s easy to think that it is\nclassic Israeli heavy-handedness but it\nseems that the initial aggression seems\nto have come from Hamas.\nMost Palestinians are striving and\nhoping for the kind of settlement that\nwas offered in 1965: Where the land\nthat is now Israel, the Gaza strip and\nthe west bank were divided in half. One\nfor Palestinians and one for Israelis and\nJerusalem was included in the Palestinian territory. Sounds good right? But\nthe leaders of the neighbouring Arab\nworlds such as Egypt\u2019s Jamal AbdulNasser decided to retort with such\nrhetoric as:\n\u201cWe shall not enter Palestine with its\nsoil covered in sand. We shall enter it\nwith its soil saturated in blood.\u201d\nAnd \u201c... the full restoration of the\nrights of the Palestinian people. In oth-Amin Elmubarak\u2019s analysis of Gaza and Israel\ner words, we aim at the destruction of\nthe State of Israel. The immediate aim:\nperfection of Arab military might. The\nnational aim: the eradication of Israel.\u201d\nThe 6-day war that ensued saw the\ncementation and expansion of the Israeli State to an area even greater than\nthe one we see today as some land was\nreturned due to peace treaties struck\nup at later dates with countries such as\nEgypt and Lebanon. Another result of\nthis History defining war is that it has\ncreated an Israel that feels justifiably\nparanoid and fearful of its neighbors\nand a Palestinian people that feel that\nthey are now the victims of an Arab\nholocaust, where they have no internationally recognized state; can be and\nN\now we see everything\nthat\u2019s going wrong with\nthe world and those who\nlead it. We just feel like\nwe don\u2019t have the means\nto rise above and beat it\u2026so we keep\non waiting, waiting on the world to\nchange\nI think the most repulsive story of\nthis Christmas holiday period, one that\nbrought in the New Year for the unfortunate people affected, demonstrates\nthese lyrics very clearly (John Mayer\nalways hits the nail on the head!). I am\nof course referring to the ongoing vicious Israeli bombardment of the Gaza\nstrip \u2013 a most heinous crime unfolding\ndaily in front of our eyes that for leaders of the \u2018free\u2019 world is mere entertainment and a chance to look the part and\ntalk the talk, while for those suffering\nthe onslaught is injustice beyond what\nwords can describe.\nThe poor people of Gaza have for\nyears been evicted from their rightful homes, forced out as refugees and\nbeggars, before being squeezed into\nthe Gaza strip \u2013 a patch of land 360\nsquare km in size but home to about\n1.5 million, making it the world\u2019s most\ndensely populated area. To this setup\nwas added a surrounding wall that\ntrapped the population inside, essentially making it the world\u2019s largest open\nair prison, and finally to really make\nthe people of Gaza suffer, a blockade\nwas imposed by Israel 18 months ago\nwhich prevented the basics of life from\nentering into Gaza such as food, medicine and energy.\nAnd now we have a military campaign of aerial and naval bombard-ment, shelling and ground assaults\nagainst the starved, deprived and\nwronged residents of this misery, who\nhave nothing but sticks and stones to\ndefend themselves and nowhere to\nrun. Not even the media is being allowed to come to their rescue.\nThe Israelis and the USA would have\nus blame Hamas for the murder their\nown weapons are wreaking. This is\ncertainly the one response every Israeli\npolitician, spokesman or supporter\nspouts to pathetically try and clamber\nfor the higher moral ground but I am\nsorry, that is just wretched.\nNo doubt the indiscriminate rocket\nattacksfromHamas\u2019militarywing,that\nmostly hit non-military targets when\nseldom they are successful, are evil and\nit is true that perhaps their original\npremise for setting up the organisation was to oppose the state of Israel,\nwhich was created at the expense of\nthe homeland of the Palestinians, but\nif we were to ignore the propaganda\nand view this situation from a neutral\npoint of view then the blame definitely\nlies on the shoulders of Israel. Let me\nexplain.\nFirstly, Hamas has said clearly that it\nis willing to come to a compromise if\nIsrael ceases all aggression, withdraws\nto 1967 borders, allows the Palestinian refugees a right to return, ends the\nblockade and releases the thousands of\nprisoners it holds without charge. It is\nIsrael though that refused to deal with\nHamas and chooses to ignore these\nreasonable demands, all the while continuing its illegal settlement building\nand illegal occupation. Moreover, HamaswasdemocraticallyelectedinGaza\nand despite gloating about democracy\nand the like, the US and Israel choose\nto leave Hamas out of \u2018peace talks\u2019 that\nthey have amongst themselves while\nthe EU stopped all aid to the desperate\nPalestinian refugees \u2013 all because the\nPalestinians used their vote.\nSecondly, Zionist propaganda has\nmade it popular in the media that Hamas broke the recent six month ceasefire to which Israel responded, when\nin fact it was Israel that broke it when\nthey bombed and killed 6 Palestinians\non the 4th of November as the world\nwas busy with the American elections.\nFurthermore, Israel had never even\nfulfilled the conditions of the ceasefire in the first place which required it\nto lift its blockade into Gaza of food,\nmedicine, water, energy and aid \u2013 the\nvery basics of life.\nSo after wronging the Palestinians by\ncaging them into the Gaza strip, starving them, reducing them to abject poverty and isolating them from the world,\nIsrael then provoked them by breaking\nthe ceasefire. So, can we really blame\nHamas for responding then with indiscriminate rocket fire?\nThirdly, if the rockets are such a\nthreat and living under their constant\ndanger such a terror, why then does\nIsrael not simply withdraw from the\nillegally occupied Palestinian territory\nwhere these rocket attacks land? Surely that would be a more just and sensible option to try in the first instance,\nbefore collectively punishing the poor\npopulace of Gaza.\nGiven the above, and that the massacre has been going on for nearly a\nmonth, one would think that this would\nbe injustice enough to punish the refugees trapped in Gaza, but sadly it isn\u2019t.\nThe attacks on the population of Gaza\nare being executed using the most indiscriminate of weapons despite Israeli\nhalf-truths claiming surgical precision,\nand even police, paramedics, doctors\nand journalists have been specifically\ntargeted, including during the daily\n3 hour complete cessation of fighting\npromised by the Israeli government.\nThe UN Security Council resolution\ncalling for a ceasefire is being ignored,\nwhile Israel continues bolstered by unwavering US support.\nHospitals, universities, schools and\nall manner of infrastructure have been\ndestroyed under the false pretext of\nblaming Hamas for everything, while\nthe blockade of the basics of life and\nmuch aid continues. Also, no international press is allowed in despite their\nvocal protests, and the information is\ncontrolled through propaganda and\ntrained media responses from various\nspokesmen that continue to not accept\nany responsibility on Israel\u2019s part.\nSo now as we all sit at home, go to\nuniversity and jobs; and as another day\ngoes by, and hundreds more die or are\norphaned, maimed and widowed in\nGaza; how can the world ever come to\nterms with this? How can it ever wash\nthe blood off its hands? In my opinion,\nthis period in history shows the values\nwe in the \u2018civilised and liberal\u2019 world so\nvigorously espouse and pride ourselves\non so much to be nothing more than\nhollow words.\nFreedom? What freedom!? The\nfreedom to carry out crimes against\nhumanity, a genocide, and not be held\naccountable? The freedom to control\ninformation and restrict access? The\nfreedom to ignore the UN yet hold\nother countries accountable to it when\nexpedient?\nHuman Rights? What Human\nWaiting on the world to change\nF\nor the past twenty days the\npopulation of Gaza has had\nto face severe aerial bombardment and a deadly\nground offensive from the\nIsraeli military. For the past eight years\nthe inhabitants of Southern Israel have\nhad to endure a constant stream of\nrockets fired indiscriminately at civilian targets. For the past sixty years the\nPalestinians have been mourning what\nthey consider the greatest catastrophe\nin their recent history, the displacement of thousands following the Israeli\ndeclaration of independence, and for\nalmost a century Jews around the world\nhave accepted the declared intent of\nthe great powers to create a homeland\nfor them in historic Palestine.\nUnder the suffocating weight of all\nthis historical baggage, with a neverending stream of wars, acts of terror-ism, deaths and UN resolutions thrown\nin for good measure, it is very tempting\nto draw a line under the past and insist\nwe focus on the present. \u2018Who cares\nabout history? People are dying as we\nspeak and the death toll is growing\ndaily. Let\u2019s deal with that, rather than\nrehash old issues!\u2019\nIf only life were that simple. There\nare no \u2018old\u2019 issues and the uncomfortable truth is that moral decisions cannot be made in a vacuum. A legitimate\nanalysis of any event must, above all\nelse, be based on context. People are\nsuffering in Gaza \u2013 there is no question of that. The Palestinians living\nin that \u2018densest strip of land on Earth\u2019\nhave endured appalling conditions for\ndecades, and their situation has deteriorated beyond measure since Operation Cast Lead began. It is impossible\nto look at the pictures of death and\ndestruction and not be moved to tears,\nbut if our arguments are to be taken seriously we cannot let our judgements\nbe clouded by our emotions. The tragic\nstate of affairs in Gaza should automatically and unconditionally inspire in all\nof us a profound sorrow and a desire\nto alleviate the misery. We should not,\nhowever, let ourselves feel misguided,\nknee-jerk fury at Israel and unthinkingly whitewash the actions of Hamas.\nWhen a child is dead it is only natural to\ncurse the hand that dropped the bomb,\nbut the guilt often lies elsewhere. And\nwhile no Hamas operatives were flying\nbombers over Gaza, indirect culpability is no less damning. It takes time and\neffort to establish context, but any conclusion reached before having done so\nis, to speak frankly, entirely worthless.\n\u2018All right, but even when considering\nthe context, how can one possibly put\nthe blame for the Gaza operation on\nanyone other than Israel? Almost 1,000\nPalestinians have been killed by the\nIDF whereas only 8 Israelis have died\nas a result of Qassam rockets in the\npast year.\u2019 When phrased in this manner the conclusion seems inevitable,\nbut there are three important points to\nbear in mind.\nFirstly, we cannot let ourselves be\ngoaded into playing the numbers game.\nNot only because numbers are in and\nof themselves irrelevant (in the Second\nWorld War, the casualties suffered by\nthe United Kingdom amounted to less\nthan 8% of the total number of German\ndead \u2013 greater loss should not be taken\nas an indication of the greater right),\nbut also because the rules of this game\nare horrendously skewed.\nHow many Israelis would have been\nkilled if every one of the almost 9,000\nrockets fired into Israeli civilian centres\nover the past eight years had hit their\ntargets? If the intelligence services had\nnot been competent enough to preempt large numbers of attacks, if the\nearly warning systems had not been as\nefficient and if the medical response\nteams available were not among the\nbest in the world? Any number of people killed by either side is a tragedy, but\ndeath tolls are less important than the\ngoals both parties aimed to achieve.\nThe tens of Qassam rockets being\nfired into Israel almost daily have one\npurpose and one purpose only: to de-stroy, disrupt and disfigure Israeli society to the greatest extent possible.\nIf any of the randomly fired rockets\nshould happen to hit an Israeli \u2013 no\nmatter what their age, profession or\neven religion, then that is considered\na victory for the Hamas militants. By\ncontrast, the IDF approach is one of\ncareful, surgical targeting of those areas or buildings out of which rockets\nhave been fired. Yes, mistakes have\nbeen made (tragic mistakes are always\nmade in times of conflict: even when\nHamas and Fatah members attempt\nto wipe each other out, the screams of\nPalestinian children are occasionally\nheard to ring through the streets of\nGaza, though their sound echoes less\nforcibly in the living rooms of Western\nEurope), but the strategies employed by\nIsrael have always attempted to minimize the civilian casualties incurred:\nsuch as when leaflets are dropped on\nareas targeted for destruction, urging\nall those inside (often including grateful Hamas militants) to flee.\nThe most incredible thing about the\nway Hamas fights is its Machiavellian\nwillingness to increase Palestinian cas-ualties. Rather than spending the money they have had responsibility for over\nthe past three years on schools, hospitals and shelters for their own people,\nthey have invested in weapons and military training in an attempt to destroy\nthe Jewish state. Rather than attempting to save their own people from the\ninevitable Israeli counter-strike, militants fire rockets from inside schools,\nplant bombs inside ambulances, stockpile ammunition in mosques and use\ntheir families as human shields. Hamas\nhave been taking their own people\nhostage \u2013 hiding among civilians to\nprotect themselves and blaming Israel\nfor any deaths that ensue.\nThe constant, heart-wrenching\nstream of images that comes out of\nGaza is an indication of the extent to\nwhich Hamas have mastered what Alan\nDershowitz calls the \u2018CNN strategy\u2019. A\ncalculating and exploitative use of the\nsuffering of their own people, Hamas\nuses deaths it has direct responsibility\nfor to paint an image of Israeli barbarism in blood. When playing such a\nbrutal, cynical and manipulative op-ponent, there is no way the numbers\ngame can yield a fair result.\nSecondly, the response from Israel is\nnot in proportion or in response to any\nisolated event or events. The response\nis to a threat posed by a dangerous and\nextremist terror organization whose\nstated aim and key political message\nis the destruction of Israel. There is a\nwidespread belief that the fact that Hamas was democratically elected means\nthat any criticism of their motives\namounts to a hypocritical attack on\ndemocracy. Nothing could be farther\nfrom the truth. Mussolini was elected\ndemocratically and Hitler came to\npower in a Germany that still used a\nsystem of proportional representation.\nThedemocraticvictoryHamasenjoyed\nis an indication solely of the popularity\nof their message \u2013 not its legitimacy.\nThirdly, there is no need to embark\non grisly rhetoric to reiterate that war\nis a ghastly, brutal, ugly thing. People\ndie. Among them civilians. But that\u2019s\nwhat war is like \u2013 NATO\u2019s actions\nregrettably killed civilians during the\nconflicts in the Balkans and Afghanistan, civilians have again and again\nproved the victims of the Sri Lankans\u2019\ncampaigns against the Tamil Tigers,\nand the bombing of Dresden and Cologne by the Allies during WWII resulted in severe non-combatant casu-alties. And while it would be absurd\nto claim that \u2018because other countries\ncan kill civilians, Israel is entitled to\u2019, it\nis equally preposterous to hold Israel\nup to a standard that no other country in any other conflict has ever had\nor even been expected to reach. Israel\nshould be held up to a high standard\n(and indeed the democratic, liberal society that exists in Israel ensures that\nthe country holds itself up to a higher\nstandard), but that does not equate to\nexposing it to grotesquely unfair criti-cism. The IDF have gone to greater\nlengths and suffered greater losses\nin their attempts to minimise civilian\ncasualties on both sides than virtually\nany other military force, as the Israeli\nSupreme Court\u2019s jurisdiction over the\nmilitary has enforced higher levels of\naccountability.\nOver the past three weeks, much has\nbeen said of the obligations of \u2018Israel\nand Hamas\u2019, or calls on \u2018both sides\u2019 to\nput an end to the violence. And while\nattacks in both directions need to stop\nfor progress to be achieved, it is morally absurd to claim any sort of equivalence between the actions or intentions of the IDF and Hamas. Hamas\nis a terrorist organization that leads\nits own people to believe that waging\nwar against Israel is the best way to\nsecure a future. Not only is this logic\nhopelessly misguided, it implies a staggering blindness to political realities.\nIsrael\u2019s existence is no longer under\nquestion, and the presence of a strong\nJewish state in the region needs to be\naccepted, not fought at the expense of\nthe Palestinian people.\nWhat we are seeing in Gaza are the\ntragic consequences of a democratic\nstate exercising its inalienable right to\nself-defence against a fundamentalist,\nviolent entity more concerned with\neliminating its enemy than preserving\nits own people. The moment Hamas\nstarts to treat the lives of Palestinians\nas more valuable than the deaths of\nIsraelis, lasting peace will be a stone\u2019s\nthrow away.\nhave been forbidden entry to places of\nworship by soldiers; need ID cards in\norder to travel to and from work; and\ngenerally helpless in controlling the\neducational future of their children\nand the global future of their people.\nIt is na\u00efve to think that Israeli military\ndominance will eradicate Hamas. Let\nus not forget that Hamas are the ruling\nparty as a result of an election that has\nbeen observed by foreign moderators.\nThis in itself is a barometer of how desperate the Palestinian people perceive\ntheir situation to be. These are a people who have seen the Israeli military\nblatantly and without regard to international law bulldoze their homes and\nolive groves and erect new settlements.\nThe displaced migrate northwards into\nGaza (making it, in effect, a large refugee camp of a million and a half with\na government) without so much as a\nmention in the media or wince from\nthe international community.\nLikewise, it is ludicrous to say that\nHamas have no hand in this dire state\nof affairs, willing to operate within and\namongst their own population, making them in affect targets to military\nretaliation. Their relentless rocket-firing campaign from the Gaza strip\non to Israeli civilians in settlements\non the border not only kills, terrorises\nand maims innocent civilians, it\u2019s an\nact as irresponsible as pelting a couple of hungry tigers that are sleeping\nfeet away from your children. They are\ncertainly not a way forward for peace\nand prosperity in the Middle East for\nthey share the same extreme views of\nNasser, refusing even to acknowledge\nIsrael\u2019s right to exist.\nHowever, military action does nothing but justify Hamas\u2019 presence and its\nextreme violent agenda. As a spokesman for Hamas said: \u201cIsrael has justified the killing of its women and its\nchildren when they killed our women\nand our children\u2026 it has justified the\nbombing of their schools and their\nkid from across the street and hiding\nin your mate\u2019s house. The punched kid\nhappens to be part of a rather extensive and aggressive family that does not\nobserve the law that then proceed to\nfire-bomb your mate\u2019s house with no\nregard to whom or what they injure\u2026\nas long as they get you in the end. Both\nparties are in the wrong for different\nreasons but those that suffer the most\nhave no hand in the violent disregard\nfor human life.\nIsrael will achieve a lot more for now\nand future generations if they try to\nmake Hamas obsolete by not making\nthe Palestinian\u2019s situation so dire. Maybe by aiding them to form their own\nstate and set up secular institutions for\neducation to improve understanding,\njob prospects, and public services.\nAnd, if Israel insists on eliminating\nthose that \u201cThreaten the freedom of\nthe State and the People of Israel\u201d then\nmaybe adopt a more clandestine approach to erasing those that displease\nthem. Although the CIA get accused\nand criticised for such actions, at least\nthey do not obliterate UN run schools,\nHospitals, women, children or three\nwhole generations of the same family\nand call it collateral damage.\nThe saddest thing in all this is that\nthe majority of the civilian population\nin Israel and the Palestinian territories\nby and large do not care about who\nis Jewish, Muslim or Christian, who\nis Arab and who is Jewish; yet these\nare the people who get murdered and\nmaimed due to the draconian and uncompromising views of extremist rulers on both sides.\nTo borrow the words of Mahmoud\nMohammed Taha who was integral in\nthe struggle for Sudanese independ-ence: \u201cthese are nations of giants, ruled\nby dwarves\u201d\n\u201cIt is much more easy to have sympathy with\nsuffering than sympathy with thought\u201d\nAmmar\nWaraich\nRights!? The people of Gaza don\u2019t\neven have the rights that animals en-joy. While children die in their parents\u2019 arms and a population is trapped\nand under siege, so-called leaders hold\ndays of talks in fancy hotels.\nDemocracy? What democracy!? So\nthat when someone we disagree with is\nelected, we can use that as an excuse to\ncollectively punish a people? So that\nwhen we elect leaders, they become\nslaves of powerful lobbies alone regardless of what is right and wrong?\nI don\u2019t understand how we can ever\nrecover from this grave act of hypoc-risy. I don\u2019t understand how Bush and\nRice can sleep at night. And I don\u2019t\nunderstand how the Israeli decision-makers can go home and look their\nfamilies in the eye.\nThe recent events have really made\nme think about all of these things and\nhow the upsetting double standards of\nthe situation show the ugly truth vivid-ly. Current estimates say that 4300 are\ninjured and the death toll is at 975, out\nof which 300 are children. No justification can be made for such slaughter\nas this is state terrorism.\nTherefore to me, Hamas is no longer\nthe terrorist \u2013 Israel has now made\nHamas the freedom fighter. And Israel\ndoes not appear to me to be a sanctuary for the persecuted, but instead the\nexecutor of a new holocaust. There is\nno way we can blame Hamas for this\nsituation above Israel and I think that\nif we truly want to see an end to ter-rorism, we have to stop supporting it\nourselves first.\nFurthermore, I do not now see how\nfollowing this barbarity, peace in the\nregion can now be worked towards,\nwhich will require from the Israelis at\nleast a withdrawal to UN sanctioned\nborders and a complete right of return\nfor the evicted refugees as citizens\nwith full rights, and from the Palestinians an end to their useless infighting\nand the adoption of a non violent ap-proach. However, how can this ever be\nachieved when the world ignores the\ndiscrimination dealt to the Palestinians\nand supports the devastation meted\nout by Israel with impunity?\nI urge us to stop waiting on the world\nto change but rather continue struggling to ultimately be the change we\nwant to see. And a big change it must\nbe, otherwise as well as this obvious\nloss of life, livelihoods, infrastructure,\nfamily and peace, there will be an insidious but ultimate loss of humanity,\ncivilisation, justice and morality that\nmay be impossible to salvage.\nGilead\nAmit\n\u201cmilitary action\ndoes nothing but\njustify Hamas\u2019\npresence and its\nextreme violent\nagenda.\u201d\nHospitals when they bombed our\nschools and our hospitals\u201d\nIn conclusion, it\u2019s like punching a\n\u201cHamas have\nbeen taking their\nown people\nhostage \u2013 hiding\namong civilians\nto protect\nthemselves and\nblaming Israel\nfor any deaths\nthat ensue\u201d\n\u201cThe Israelis and\nthe USA would\nhave us blame\nHamas for the\nmurder their\nown weapons\nare wreaking\u201d\n\u201cI do not now\nsee how,\nfollowing this\nbarbarity, peace\nin the region\ncan be worked\ntowards\u201d\n- Oscar Wilde\n\n"

the taxi driver on the way home\nto let him pay in Euros nobody is sure.\nThe drama of the evening was left to\nthose who had sensibly left to get an\nearly night before fencing. On the way\nback to the minibus a broken pedestrian crossing lead to a mix up with Emily\nhaving a run in with a taxi. Everyone\nwas extremely grateful to find out that\nEmily was quite bouncy and that the\ntaxi appeared to have the worst of the\ndamage with a broken windscreen.\nThough, Emily ended up having to go\nto hospital accompanied by Hannah\nBryars.\nThe next morning was only slightly\nless eventful. Whilst everyone was having breakfast, and admiring the photos\nHannah had kindly taken of Emily in\nhospital wearing a neck brace (luckily\nEmily had only hurt her knee), Maiyuran Ratneswaran limped in. It turned\nout he\u2019d fallen down the stairs carrying\nhis kit bag, landing badly on his ankle.\nThe final day saw the competitions\nfor men\u2019s sabre with Chris N finishing\noff his third event of the weekend, this\ntime joined by Maiyuran and Maurice\nBerk. For the women it was the foil\nwith last year\u2019s winner Hannah joining\nJoan and Beth who was subbing in for\nEmily.\nBoth events started off with mixed\nresults, with Maiyuran left representing the men after both Chris and Maurice got knocked out in the 128. In the\nfoil Joan and Beth made the last 64 before leaving Hannah to represent the\nwomen.\nWith Maiyuran injured and Hannah\nhaving had little sleep after spending\nhalf the night at the hospital, things\nwere not looking amazing.\nIn the following rounds Hannah\npulled of an impressive comeback after\nan initial deficit to win her knock-out\nand Maiyuran battled through his pain\nto beat a Latvian international. Both\nthen got through their next rounds\neasily before Maiyuran met last year\u2019s\nwinner in the semi-finals. Without full\nmovement this was going to be a tough\nmatch for him and eventually he lost\nout to take the bronze medal, with his\nopponent going on to win overall for a\nsecond time.\nHannah made it through to the final\ncomfortably, where her opponent was\na fencer from Bristol she had recently\nbeaten in the team matches. Unfortunately for her opponent the lack of\nsleep was not enough to put Hannah\noff her game and she went on to win\nher 3rd women\u2019s foil title in a row.\nAt the end of the weekend we came\nback with 3 medals, 2 fencers injured\nand all extremely tired.\nover college.\nThe Conservatives and Liberal\nDemocrats strongly appose the plan\nand vow to scrap it if they are elected\nto government at the next general\nelection.\nHowever the threat of demolition\nis not over- air travel is set it increase\nin the coming years as budget airlines offer increasingly cheaper seats,\nwhich could lead to an increase in the\nnumber of planes which need to take\noff and land.\nIf Heathrow cannot expand, it is\nproposed that a 24-hour airport could\nbe created on an artificial island in\nthe Thames Estuary, possibly replacing Heathrow altogether. This is Boris\nJohnson\u2019s favoured solution.\nThe future of sport at Imperial looks\nlike it is set for a move to Northwood\nGreen, but for now teams will continue\nto compete and train at Teddington\nand the affectionately named \u201cFortress\nHarlington\u201d.\nContinued from back page\nContinued from back page\nHarlington will be left with the artificial pitches to the right of the car park if expansion plans see fruition\nIC fencing club on their way to achieve their respectable medal haul\nSome of you may remember our frustrating away trip to Brunel a number of\nweeks ago. They ended up winning that\nmatch 9-8, having conveniently managed to forfeit the last three matches\nwhen we were winning 6-8. Due to this\nresult, Brunel were sitting comfortably\nat the top of the BUCS South Eastern\nConference 1A division. If they would\nbeat us, they would win the division\neasily and go through to the play-offs\nfor a chance to play in the Premier\nDivision next season, with the likes of\nLondon Met (the current European\nUniversity Champions).\nSince this defeat, we trained hard and\nwere psyched up for the return match.\nOn the Monday before the fixture, a\nyoung German exchange student called\nBernd turned up to our practice, claiming to have been out for two months\nwith injury. We were impressed with\nhis skills and so invited him to play for\nus for this crunch match.\nThe team thus consisted of Eddie, Bernd, Yang and myself. Things\nstarted off extremely well with three\nwins. Darius beat Brunel\u2019s number\nfour in straight sets; Eddie dispatched\ntheir number three in four games.\nBernd had a superb debut victory over\nBrunel\u2019s number two, eventually coming through 3-2.\nThe best victory of the first half of\nmatches went to Yang. Having lost the\nfirst game 5-11, he strengthened his\nresolve and rallied well to take it 3-1.\nTwo more victories in the reverse fixtures for Eddie and Darius meant that\nthey had raced to a 6-nil lead. Things\nwere going better than expected.\nUnfortunately our opponents took\nthe next two games. Bernd played well,\nbut Brunel\u2019s number one just nicked\nit, 14-12 in the fourth game. Yang got\nTable Tennis\nImperial Men\u2019s 1st 14\nBrunel Men\u2019s 1st 3\nDarius Atashroo\nIC table tennis humiliate\nleague leaders in style\nvery close to Brunel\u2019s number two in\na match with some great topspin ral-lies. However Yang\u2019s opponent went\nfor his shots in the final game and just\nsneaked it, 14-12.\nA slight blip, but it turned out to\nbe little more than a consolation for\nBrunel as these were the only singles\nmatches they won all day.\nDarius had a bit of a scare against\nBrunel\u2019s number two, going down 1-2\nbefore bringing it back in the last two\ngames to win 3-2. Eddie cruised to victory over Brunel\u2019s number one, winning three on the bounce and making\nhis opponent look rather tame. Bernd\nand Yang enjoyed relatively easy victories over Brunel\u2019s numbers four and\nthree respectively.\nNext up was Darius\u2019 match against\nthe Brunel number one. He had lost\nto him closely in five tight sets in the\nlast fixture. There had also been some\nbad blood between them over the last\nresult when Darius had questioned the\nlegality of his services.\nAt 2-2 in games, it was pretty even\nbut Darius managed to take an early\nlead in the fifth, which enabled him\nto win it 11-6. This win really meant\nsomething to Darius. It also seemed to\ncrush whatever little resolve the Brunel\nboys had left. We took the last three\nsingles matches comfortably.\nBernd and Darius teamed up for the\ndoubles match, which we should have\ntaken easily, however as the result of\nthe match was neither here nor there,\nwe lost our concentration, and the\nmatch in five.\nAll in all it was arguably our best\nwin of the season. Our rivals looked\ndejected and we could still secure a\ntop two finish. Congratulations to all\nof the boys on a thoroughly superb\nperformance.\nConcentration is key when delivering that killer serve\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8\n9 10\n11 12\n13 14\n15\n16 17 18 19\n20\n21\n22\n23 24 25\n26 27\nAnswers to: sudoku.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nCrossword No. 1,420\nAcross\n1 More than one annoyance is found in\nthe details (9)\n6 Famous piper is discovered after\ndamage (5)\n9 From the beginning it is over: there\nwill be nothing at the end (2,3)\n10 To fit padding up a leather guncase\n(7)\n11 (8,6)\n13 Dances into Hell, tearing important\nconnective tissue (8)\n14 Worship Paul, the patriot (6)\n16 The fields of France conceal the\nvictors (6)\n18 Hardy heroine returns after\nrevolutionary\u2019s board game in pieces\n(5,3)\n21 Incapable urban development in the\nestablishment of tinpot little country\n(6,8)\n23 Throw in worn out, overused fossil (9)\n25 Contests of speed can be seen as\nstrains (5)\n26 Spanish saint saves Antarctic core (5)\n27 Shiny apes change formulation of\n\u2018impossible\u2019tasks (9)\nDown\n1 Prophet makes no expression of\nsatisfaction (4)\n2 Smooth piece of cloth famously used\nby Churchill (4,7)\n3 Way of expressing contrition for a lot,\ninformally, in mass (7)\n4 Two lines of verse put close together\n(8)\n5 Switzerland is into violent sexual\nactivities, meaning a break in friendly\nrelations (6)\n6 Famous playwright has a lie-in more...\n7 ... regularly once tuberculosis starts\ngenerating decomposition (3)\n8 Most unusual choice to place\nbetween two paths (8)\n12 Put on clothes and select a place to\nsit in the theatre (5,6)\n13 Raises organisms on regular solids, in\nwith a time coming later (9)\n15 High-fliers slash head of personnel...\n(8)\n17 ... either with or without aide stifling\nGreek first lady (7)\n19 Male puppy has clean up to remove\nthe effects of alcohol (5,2)\n20 Revolves as a whole, or with small\npieces (6)\n22 An identifying number is barbaric\nand nonessential, for starters...(4)\n24 ... in new drinking establishment\n(3)\nA warm welcome back and a happy 2009 to you all.

Every further rung on\nthis well-trodden educational ladder\nhas always been a larger leap up from\nthe last.\nThe transition between school and\nUniversity was the biggest in my life,\nmade larger and harder as I foolishly\nthrust myself into the self-inflicted\nacademic rape that is Imperial College.\nBut, after a three week stint of twelve\ndeadlines, three hours of sleep a night,\nearly morning and late night library\nvisits, I can truly say I\u2019ve finally settled\ninto the ethic of this university. Last\nyear, if I was thrown into the same po-sition, I would have broken down with\nstress, and cried pitifully down the\nphone to my parents that Imperial was\n\u201call too hard, I\u2019m too thick, everybody\u2019s\nunbelievably keen and clever,\u201d and\ncalled quits on my time here at Keeno\nCity. And I very nearly did.\nCome the Easter holidays of Freshers\u2019 Year, I was a phone call away from\ncalling Registry and asking them to\nstart the procedure of removing my\nname from the registers. I had Student\nLoans and University-transfer logistics\nprepared. I was feeling utterly disillusioned with Imperial College and\nready to turn my academically-lashed\nback on it. I never actually wanted to\ndo Biology. Coming to think of it, I\nnever actually wanted to do a science.\nI was just good at it at school. The pretence of enjoyment due to ease was\nquickly washed away at Imperial when\nI realised I wasn\u2019t actually that good at\nJust like the rest\nof us\nDan Wan offers a note for\nthose who are about to fail\nF\nor a while, I was struggling\nto find something to write\nabout this week, and it was\nonly after dinner at a friend\u2019s\nhouse that the inspiration\ncame. Was it the Thai Chicken Green\nCurry that he had made for us? No, but\nthat\u2019s not saying that it wasn\u2019t tasty, he\nhad clearly spent a lot of time on it and\nit was time well spent. No, it wasn\u2019t the\nfood that inspired me, it was the text\nmessage that he received at the end of\ndinner telling us that a certain royal\nwas in the local pub.\nNot wanting to miss out on an opportunity to see the royal, or just have\na laugh at the girl who told us when we\nrealised that she was wrong, we quickly\ngot our coats and left. Once in the pub\nwe found our friends and asked them\nwhere the royal was, only to have him\nwalk right by us as we were asking.\nHaving acknowledged that the royal\nwas indeed in the pub, it seemed right\nto actually get a drink otherwise we\nwould had just looked a bit odd standing there.\nThe first thing I noticed was how\neveryone else in the pub was just so\nrelaxed and quiet, as if he wasn\u2019t there.\nLooking around though everyone was\nolder and clearly polite because thinking about it, I\u2019d be pretty annoyed if\npeople kept coming up to me if I was\ntrying to have a pint. And that was exactly what was happening, he was just\nanother person in a pub, trying to have\na quiet pint with some friends.\nIt was refreshing to see that all that\nwealth and privilege hadn\u2019t got to his\nhead, and what was even more refreshing was to see that he was like others his\nage, he, my friends, was a lad! Not only\nwas he joining in with the boisterous\nsinging and drinking pints whilst others in his party were drinking wine, he\nwas also introducing drinking games\nto the rest of the table. To all the footballers out there, this one is for you,\nthis royal family member was teaching\neveryone else on his table how to play\nmatchbox! We couldn\u2019t believe it and\nto make things even better he failed to\nget the box over the pint and had to effectively down a pint.\nThe one person that we hadn\u2019t really\nnoticed up to that point was the mind-er, who was just sitting there silently\nwatching everything that was going on.\nIt was only when the royal had to down\na pint that the minder, who could have\nbeen his father looking at the fiery colour of his hair, took the pint away from\nhim. As one of the people with me\nsaid, it is like being at The Union and\nthe stewards ruining your fun. And\nthen we thought for a second how protected his life is, to permanently have\na minder watching you and making\nsure you don\u2019t do something stupid. So\ndespite that on paper he seemed to be\njust like the rest of us, there were two\nbig differences. Although wealthy, his\nlife was a little bit sheltered, almost as\nif the minder was stopping him doing\nstupid things that we would normally\ndo when drunk.\nSo the next time you\u2019re complaining\nabout how the stewards at The Union\nkeep ruining your fun, spare a thought\nfor this royal who, it seems, wants to\nbe like the rest of us but can\u2019t. Then\nagain you could be his minder who has\nto watch you get drunk and look after\nyou.

I found everything ultra-competitive, both work-wise and so-cially. There was something I couldn\u2019t\nquite put my finger on, but I just wasn\u2019t\nfitting in comfortably.\nThere were plenty more reasons why\nI thought Imperial was simply not the\nplace I wanted to spend a further two\nand a half years at. As I said, I was\nready to withdraw from College. I\u2019d\ntold my family and had started telling\nmy friends.\nHowever, after several hours of a\nfrustratingly slow understanding between my parents and I, it was agreed\nthat I should finish off my first year at\nImperial and \u2018assess the situation after\nthat.\u2019 At the time, there was only ever\ngoing to be one thing I\u2019d do come the\nend of that first year. No matter how\nwell I did in the end of year exams, I\nwould withdraw and hopefully take up\na place to read English Literature at\nManchester University.\nHowever, here I still am; not battling\nthe member-losing temperatures of\nthe North, but the questionably tamer,\nif not still bloody cold, ones of London.\nSo what exactly happened?\nThings came together. I started to\nenjoy my course; and anyone that ever\nspoke to me in my first year knew how\nmuch of a hatred I had/have for my\nsubject. Intense revision for summer\nexams batted away a lot of the confusion that fuelled the hatred I had for\nthe course. I realised there was a lot\nmore going for me. Imperial exam\npressure brought out different sides\nto people. Bravados I\u2019d loathed before\nwere replaced by a whimpering fear\nof impending failure. People became\nmore open and honest about their situ-ation, which their bravado had simply\nnot allowed them to be. Then you realised the people who you thought were\nclever enough to pull through the exam\nperiod unscathed actually couldn\u2019t.\nThey were in the same mess you were\nin: notes out of order, the inability to fit\nevery necessary bit of the revision into\ntheir head, and the general and guilt of\napathy that surrounds exams.\nIf you\u2019re finding yourself in the same\nor similar situation that I did last year,\nI\u2019m not arrogant enough to think I can\nsolve everything that\u2019s wrong with\nyour situation by some definitive piece\nof advice in a felix article.\nIf you\u2019re in your first year, still not\nentirely sure what is expected of you\nat this College and generally finding\ntimes hard to roll with, rather than\nbailing out like I nearly did, stick it out.\nBut don\u2019t stick it out because you have\nto. Grab the opportunity you\u2019ve been\ngiven now. You\u2019re at one of the world\u2019s\ntop universities (as you\u2019ve been told a\nmillion times, but you really are), and\neven if Imperial isn\u2019t for you (because\nit certainly isn\u2019t for me), there\u2019s nothing\nout of your grasp that you can\u2019t make\nImperial suit you that little bit better.\nJoin some clubs and societies and get\nto meet new people, or actually speak\nto your next lab partner rather than regard him as \u2018that annoyingly clever shit\nyou\u2019ve been paired with\u2019. Get your head\ndown and blitz out some real work; you\nmight start enjoying it. I\u2019m not exactly\nthriving on my course currently; far\nfrom it. In truth, I\u2019m averaging pretty\npoorly and the forecast is distinctively\ncloudy. But the important fact is that\nI\u2019m doing much better than I expected,\nand at Imperial, you learn to \u2018up\u2019 your\ngame when you need to. Imperial will\nteach you a lot without your even realising it. Skills such as time management,\nself motivation and hard graft will hold\nyou in good stead for anything you do\nbeyond the walls of South Kensington.\nIf, in the end, you still feel you need\nto withdraw from Imperial, at least\nyou won\u2019t have left with a pathetic\n\u2018what could have been\u2019 angst-filled fist\nshake; the one you give as you glance\nat the semi-delight that is the Sherfield\nBuilding for the last time. Make your\ndecision before this year\u2019s UCAS dead-line. It made the prospect of leaving\nthat much more unattainable for me.\nAs stuffy a reputation as Imperial may\nhave, and as stuffy as Imperial actually\nis, it is there for your taking. So, perk\nup and take it, before you regret missing out on this open opportunity of a\nwhole new experience you never even\nrealised was there.\n\u201cI was ready\nto drop out. I\u2019d\ntold my family\nand had started\ntelling my\nfriends. I just\nwasn\u2019t fitting in\ncomfortably.\u201d\nThe computer mocks you.

How\u2019s it\ngoing?\nGreat thanks! Hockey is going well\nand 2009 promises to be an exciting\nyear all round.\nSo when you say that hockey is\ngoing well \u2013 how well is it going?\nAs you can see from the league table\nwe have only lost one match, which\nwas disappointing since it was a BUCS\nknockout game and we got to the semifinals last year in the equivalent com-petition. I suppose it was a blessing\nthat it wasn\u2019t a league match because\nalthough we are top, Canterbury Christ\nChurch are not far behind! Currently\nwe haven\u2019t played a ULU match yet but\nthere is definite potential for some bonus silverware there as well!\nIf we do go up in BUCS it will be a\ntough year \u2013 there are not many teams\nthat can sustain it in that league that\nare not sports based universities.\nSounds good! What is the key to\nsuccess?\nWell the team trains hard and plays\nhard\u2026 We have developed a really\ngood team culture this year and we\nhave bonded into a strong squad. We\nare also being supported financially by\nthe Union, Sport Imperial and Merrill\nLynch enabling us to have a coach who\nis able to come to games which is hugely beneficial! It takes the weight off my\nshoulders in terms of training and the\nstarting line-up. It allows me to concentrate on playing my own game and\ngenerate the camaraderie between the\nboys on and off the pitch.\nSo what is the preparation for\nyou going to be like in the lead up\nto varsity?\nOur main focus presently is the\nBUCS league and with ULU matches as\nwell, it will give us plenty of pitch time\nbefore the big day\u2026 Varsity is never the\nsame as a League or Cup match, there\nis far more passion and a hell of a lot\nof pride at stake. On one hand, I view\nit as a friendly (because essentially that\nis what it is especially with it being surrounded by important league and cup\nfixtures), but on the other I will give\nmy all to win it\u2026 The adrenaline is\npumping through me now just thinking about it. For me it is a great honour\nto be able to lead the 1st XI out onto\nthe pitch every week, but varsity does\nhave that little bit extra!\nSo how do you fancy your\nchances?\nTo be honest we are unlikely to slip\nup. We usually play the medics three\nor four times a year since we are in\nsimilar leagues which accumulates to\na lot of matches over four years\u2026 We\nhave only lost to them once in my time\nand with the form we are in at the moment I predict a convincing win for the\nCollege.\nWhy do you think\nthat IC Hockey is\nconsistently\nbetter\nthan\ntheir medic counterparts?\nI\u2019m unsure to be honest \u2013 you could\nargue that the medics have a slower\nturnover of players (since they are here\nfor a longer period of time) and therefore should produce better organised\nteams that play well together. Having said that the turnover of players\nat Imperial gives the club a fresh feel\nevery year with new faces prepared to\ngive up time and push things forward.\nThere are literally only a couple of us\nleft who played in the 1st XI in my\nfirst year \u2013 I have probably played with\ntwenty to thirty players over my time\nat IC and I have learnt something different off all of them. The ladies 1st XI\nhave the medics on Sunday \u2013 we\u2019ll see\nwhat happens there! C\u2019mon girls!\nWhat about other sports \u2013 most\nimportantly the JPR Williams\nCup?\nWell, hockey should dominate and\nfootball seem to do the same. Maybe\nthe IC footballers and hockey players\nshould swap sports for the day \u2013 might\ngivethemedicsachance!Itwouldmake\nmy day if the rugby boys could do it\u2026\nThey have had a pretty depressing season so far and it would give them the\nboost they need to get them out of the\nrelegation zone in their BUCS league.\nI will be supporting all of the IC sport\nwhen I am not playing to the best of\nmy ability \u2013 I can make a lot of\nnoise when I want to. Maybe I\ncan make the difference at the\nrugby!\nEnough about varsity,\nwhat about ICHC?\nThe club doesn\u2019t need an\nintroduction. Clearly up there\nwith ICURFC and ICUAFC\nbut has the added bonus of being a mixed club making the socials\nfar more entertaining! On a personal\nnote it has provided me with a great\nnumber of friends and some fabulous\nmemories and I will be sad to leave it\nat the end of the year.\nAny highlights?\nErr, well tours to Cyprus and Berlin were both a great laugh. Sports\ntours are the combination of\neverything great: beer, hockey,\nsun and mates. The social\nside in general is always a\nhighlight \u2013 I can count on\none hand the amount of\ntimes I have missed a\nWednesday out with\nthe boys. Also the\nsuccess we have\nhad on the\npitch as a\nteam has\nbeen\ngreat\nSix weeks until the big day! The build up to 25 February 2009 continues into the New Year, with the\nImperial 1st XI Hockey captain, Jack Cornish, being interviewed by the felix Sports Editor, Jack Cornish\nfor me and hopefully there will be some\nmore silverware on its way this year.\nWhere are you going on tour this\nyear?\nIndia! It will be great! With a substantial number of the club coming, there\nis a hell of a lot to organise but I am\nreally looking forward to it! There will\nbe some great hockey and culture to\nappreciate, not to mention the curry!\nWhat are your aspirations once\nyou leave Imperial?\nI have played with some very good\nplayers during my time at IC\u2026 Four\nor five have played at the highest level\nin the UK and Germany and coming\nfrom the deepest and darkest depths\nof Somerset I never got the chance\nto play at the highest standard\u2026 The\nhockey I used to play at home could be\ndescribed a combination of village and\nrural! Most turned up in their wellies\nwith a pint of cider in their hand! My\naim is to play for a national league club\neven if I am playing for their 3rd XI\u2026\nAt least then I have something to aim\nfor!\nNot aiming for Olympic glory\nthen?!\nWell, I like to be realistic\u2026 I would\nlike to be involved in some way\nthough \u2013 volunteering or\nsuch like! It is a great\nhonour for London\nto be hosting the games\n\u2013 we now have to\nmake sure we don\u2019t let\nBoris anywhere near it!

However\nthe majority of the 1,000 dead have been Palestinians, with nearly a third of\ndeaths being children according to medical sources in Gaza, who also reported that hospitals have received 4,500 injured Palestinians.\nThe conflict has gained a further international dimension with a public\nstatement by Osama Bin Laden urging Muslims to wage \u201cjihad in the path\nof God\u201d against Israel. The 22-minute audiotape containing his message also\ncriticised Arab states for not doing enough to support the Palestinians.\nPalestine\nEdited by Hassan Joudi\nDespite the most recent Research Assessment Exercise placing Imperial\nnumber one in the country for world-leading and internationally excellent\nresearch, the College still stands to\nsuffer a significant cut in the allocated\nresearch funding, which is to be announced later this academic year.\nThe 2008 RAE found that 150 out\nof 159 surveyed universities have produced 4* and 3* level research, with\n17%ofallworkproducedbeingdeemed\n\u2018world leading\u2019. This result is not only\npositively surprising, but also higher\nthan ever. This may however, have a\nlarge impact in how research funding\nis distributed to English universities.\nCurrently, the bulk (over 80%) of\nfunding is allocated to just under 20%\nof all universities, most of which are\nthe mammoths of the Russell Group,\ncomprised by 20 research intensive\ninstitutions such as University College London, Cambridge and Imperial.\nThe funding which is awarded by the\nHigher Education Funding Council\nfor England (Hefce) is distributed according to a formula based on the RAE\nresults. As it stands, it is speculated\nthat the Russell Group could lose circa\n10% of its yearly funding \u2013 or in gross\nterms, up to \u00a3140m. Assuming this cut\nis not weighted in any fashion, Imperial could stand to around \u00a37m; a rather\nsignificant amount in research funding\nterms.\nThe Director General of the Russell Group, Dr Wendy Piatt is worried\nabout a possible \u201chaemorrhaging\u201d of\nmoney received by the constituent\nuniversities. It is her view that while\nquality deserves recognition in its own\nright, it is \u201cmass\u201d that is paramount \u2013\na mixture of quality and quantity. She\nreiterates the World Bank view that\neach country must, in order to remain academically competitive, have\na \u201cproportion of world-class universities\u201d, saying it fuels \u201ceconomic growth\nand furthers the knowledge economy\u201d.\nHannah Theodorou, the Deputy President of Education and Welfare of Imperial College Union has commented\nthat this possible cut is \u201cdisappointing\u201d\nand may make \u201crecruiting efforts much\nharder\u201d.\nIt is important to note that Hefce has\nnot yet commented on how it will allocate the money or if the formula previously used will be changed to soothe\nthe fears of Vice-Chancellors throughout the country.\nChina overtook Germany to become the world\u2019s third largest economy\nin 2007 after the Chinese government revised its estimates of how much\nits economy grew that year.\nWith an estimated annual growth of 13.0% instead of 11.9%, the Chinese economy\u2019s GDP (Gross Domestic Product) in 2007 was approximately\n$3.382bn, which was slightly greater than Germany\u2019s GDP in 2007. Germany\nhas always traditionally been third with USA in first place and Japan in sec-ond. That being said, China\u2019s GDP per capita is many times smaller than that\nof Germany. This news emphasises the strides China has made since it began\nreforming its Mao-era economy exactly 30 years ago in 1979.\nChina\nThe Maoist-led government of Nepal has begun a six-moth National Literacy Campaign (NLC) as part of a programme to achieve 100% literacy\nwithin two years.\nAccording to the official census some eight million adults, out of a national\npopulation of 26 million, cannot read or write because they have not had\nthe chance to go to school. Under the slogan \u201cKnow Alphabets, Be Literate\u201d\nthe government hopes 2.6 million people will be made literate by mid-April.\nThey will be taught by about 90,000\nyoung volunteers who are mainly\nstudents with a School Leaving Certificate. Eliminating illiteracy was a\nkey election pledge of the Nepalese\nCommunist (Maoist) Party, which\njoined an interim government after\na civil war between 1996 and 2006,\nand are now the largest party in the\nparliament.\nNepal\nPolish construction workers have unearthed a World War II-era mass\ngrave containing the remains of 1,800 bodies.\nThe town of Malbork in northern Poland was part of Germany before 1945\nand construction of a luxury hotel there was halted in October 2008 after\nseveral bodies were found. Now it is clear that the site is a mass grave containing civilians of German origin and archaeologists say that many more\nmay yet be found. In the last\nweeks of the war in 1945,\nMarlbork was the scene of\nheavy fighting between retreating German forces and\nthe advancing Soviet Red\nArmy.\nSome of the bodies contained gunshot wounds\nindicating they were probably killed by advancing Soviet forces but the cause of\ndeath for others was hunger\nand cold.\nPoland\nWhat? All this cash going to Bath Spa and Thames Valley? Damn...\nRCSU Science Challenge\nbigger than ever\nAlice Rowlands\nNews Correspondent\nThe annual RCSU science challenge\nwill be launched on the 22nd January\nfor Imperial students and participating\nschools. With over twenty thousand\npounds worth of prizes available, it\u2019s\nlikely that the students of Imperial will\nbe spending the next few days trying to\nremember how to write in prose rather\nthan C++.\nThe competition, which was first run\nin 2005, will follow a similar format to\nprevious years, where a panel of judges\neach set a question related to a scientific topic and the effect it may have on\nthe wider world. Applicants respond,\nto the questions posed, in the form of\nan 800 word essay. Previous questions\nhave included topics such as how we\ncould go about colonising Mars and\nthe effect knowing your genetic makeup could have on your lifestyle\nThe competition is run by students\nfrom the Royal College of Science Union with the aim of promoting scientific\ncommunication and creative thinking\namongst young people. The assumption is that the same individuals that\nwill eventually shape the future of our\nplanet over the years to come, hence\ninspiring scientific debate amongst\nthem will have a positive effect on future generations.\nAs well as inspiring debate and encouraging scientific communication,\nthe challenge is an excellent excuse for\na party, last years prize-giving party\nwas a very swanky affair, held at the\nRitz, which should be enough to get\nanyone\u2019s creative juices flowing!\nThe felix editor is a little concerned\nthat with a top prize of \u00a35000 for an\n800 word essay equating to \u00a36.25 per\nThe R.C,S. crest so you can cut-out-and-keep to enjoy at your leisure\nword, his staff may soon be demanding\npayment for their work.\nIf you\u2019re interested in entering, the\nlaunch party is on Thursday 22nd January, 6pm in the Sir Alexander Fleming\nBuilding. Prof Sir Robert Winston will\nbe a guest speaker and this years questions will be announced. Or you can\nwatch the whole thing online at:\nhttp://sciencechallenge.org\n\n"

Write for us.\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n13\nFriday 16 January 2009 felix\nArts\nThe Art of the Poster\nEmily Wilson is left underwhelmed by The Art of the Poster at\nthe British Transport Museum\nCaz Knight\nArts Editor\nWelcome to the Wonderland\nThere\u2019s far more to Russia than oligarchs and oil. Caz Knight drowns in a sea of opulence at the V&A\nT\nhe Magnificence of the\nTsars presents a small but\nexquisite exhibition of the\nregal ceremonial men's\ndress of the Russian Imperial Court, 1721-1917. These clothes\nwould have been especially fitting for\ndisplay of the royals to their doting\nand awed subjects, for \u2018magnificence\u2019\nand \u2018splendour\u2019 are certainly words to\ndescribe the ornament and impact of\nthese special garments. From ermine\nand glittering silver brocade to delicate\nsilks, linens and wools, \u2018Magnificence\nof the Tsars\u2019 provides you with a rich\ntaster of the royal feast that was the\nwardrobe of the Russian rulers.\nOn the day of the opening of the\nexhibition, we were introduced to the\nroyal garb by Svetlana Amelekhina of\nthe Moscow Kremlin Museums, who\nspoke elegantly and proudly about this\nexclusive regal display from her home\ncountry. Judging by Amelekhina\u2019s contributions to literature on the subject\nof Russian costume and her having co-curated numerous other displays, this\nexhibition represents a chance for her\nto share with us the treasures of Russia that she has brought back to life\nthrough their display at the V&A.\nThe initial point, pressed upon us\nwas the \u201crarity\u201d of such an exhibition.\nAmelekhina explained to us that some\nof these garments, such as a mourning\nrobe of Peter II, had not yet been displayed publicly in Russia and that put\nus in a privileged position as viewers.\nRussia had no great connections\nwith the rest of Europe until Peter I\n(\u2018the Great\u2019) explored it, with a 250-strong entourage. Inspired by the elegant costumes of the courts he had\nvisited, he decided to throw out all the\ntraditional Russian dress and assume\nthe courtly fashion of western Europe.\nThe tailors and textile-makers had not\nyet learnt the expertise necessary to\nprovide their Emperor with his \u2018new\nclothes\u2019 and so much of the royal wardrobe was made in France.\nOne or two romantic stories transpired from the exhibition, as objects\nsteeped in history frequently offer.\n\u201cExposed for the first time\u201d is a set of\ncoachmen\u2019s coats, rescued from the\nsiege of the Winter palace and stored\naway until now. The final costume on\ndisplay was that of Nicholas II from\nthe Russian Ball at the Winter Palace\nin 1903, to celebrate the reign of Alexei\nI. The Tsaritsa Alexandra wanted to\norganise an old-fashioned ball, with\nguests donning 17th-century attire.\nFor this, the last grand ball of imperial Russia she had all the family jewels\nsewn onto the costumes, which must\nhave provided a breath-taking display\nT\nestament to the power\nof posters on the Undergound is the fact that I\nwent to this exhibition\nof posters on the Underground having seen a poster about\nit on the Underground. As Imperial\nstudents, living in London, many of us\nsee the posters featured in the exhibition every day, most likely without ever\nthinking about who designed them,\nhow they were designed and what messages they're trying to put across.\n\"The Art of the Poster\" is on at the\nLondon Transport Museum, which\nis handily located at Covent Garden.\nGetting into the museum costs \u00a35 if\nyou're a student and you decline to\nparticipate in all that Gift Aid non-sense, and then the exhibition itself is\nfree. It's disappointing that the London\nTransport Museum still charges for\nentry. For that reason, I think I will be\none of very few people who will visit\njust for this small exhibition.\nI hadn't been to the museum since I\nwas very young, back before its big re-vamp. It's an eye-paining adventure in\ntouch screens and Mayor of London\npropaganda, but still accompanied by\nold buses being ridden by 70s style\nplastic dummies and loud small chil-dren. The museum's visitors are almost\nentirely families with children and elderly trainspotting types. I don't think I\nwould ever recommend it to us trendy\nstudents as a fun day out. The museum doesn't strike me as very popular\nat the moment \u2013 I went on a Sunday\nafternoon, when the Science Museum\nwould be heaving, and it was worry-ingly empty.\nThe exhibition is a chronological\ndisplay of art commissioned to appear\non London transport posters. It ranges\nfrom a traditionally advertisement \"No\nneed to ask a p'liceman! Undergound\nto anywhere. Quickest way, cheapest\nfare\", 1908, to a more conceptual \"Visit\nLeytonstonia\" of 2008. Anybody interested in design will find this exhibition\nworthwhile. It's fascinating to see how\nartists are commissioned, how their\nsketches develop and how the rough\nand ready originals are turned in to\ncrisp, glossy posters. There's enough\non printing techniques to entertain\nthe art buffs, but still a few interactive\ntouchscreens to keep young visitors\nquiet.\nA highlight is the chance to see the\nposters that didn't make it on to the\ntrain platforms. Well-known artist\nJohn Nash was commissioned in 1950,\nbut produced a dreary brown scene of\nthe Chilterns that I would readily have\nditched too. Also lost were posters that\nclashed with the two World Wars, and\na bewildering image of some guns intended for the Lord Mayor's Show that\nwas deemed unsuitable.\nWhat strikes me the most is the\nlack of change across 100 years of\nposters. Sure, you can pick out key\nartistic trends as you wander along\nthe chronology. But so much of the\nmodern stuff emulates older styles to\nthe point where you can't place them\nin time. Compare \"Primrose Hill\" by\nPaul Catherall (2007) and \"Pinner\" by\nNancy Smith (1916) \u2013 they are almost\nidentical. The same trends are present\nthroughout the exhibit: bold, garish colours, crisp lines and that classic London Undergound typography.\nSome of the paintings are beautiful and\ndeserve to be in an art gallery in their\nown right. However, I get the feeling\nthere are some classics missing.\nThere was nothing here I recognised from art galleries or the walls of\nmy nearest tube station. When I walk\nround the gift shop they have dozens of\npostcards of Art on the Undeground,\nnone of which was in the exhibition.\nWhere is it all?\nMy overall point about the exhibition is that it's very pleasant but you\nprobably shouldn't fork out a fiver just\nto come and see it. It's a single room\ntacked on at the end of the long museum route, and unless you're visiting the\nmain museum as well there's not much\npoint in making the journey.\nThe subject of posters on the under-gound, something that could have been\namazing, could have been extended\ninto something bigger and better. I felt\na little let down. To add insult to injury,\na leaflet in the exhibition informed me\n\"our world-famous poster collection is\nnow online.\nI suggest you save the money and\nvisit www.ltmuseum.co.uk\nW\nelcome to 2009\u2019s\nfirst issue of felix\nand felix arts. I am\nhoping the majority had time to\nrelax and leave studying a far distant\nmemory of the term before. I certainly\nfell into this category and resolved to\ndo absolutely nothing, not even write\n\u2013 one of my favourite things.\nInstead, my cultural experience over\nthe holidays took a lazy approach, one\nexperienced mainly from the comfort\nof a chair. I received several beautiful,\nheavy books on H.R.Giger\u2019s art and\nthe autobiography of illustrator Alan\nAldridge (an exhibition of his is currently in its last weeks at the Design\nMuseum) \u2018The Man with the Kaleidescope Eyes\u2019. It is easy to label both men\nwith the title \u2018genius\u2019. I dipped into\nAldridge\u2019s book when I needed a trip\nthrough twisted, multicoloured lands\nthat belong in your childhood dreams\nand into Giger\u2019s when I felt like a twist-ed, dark preview of what the future\nmight look like. Out there is something\nfor every day, every mood and every\nwhim, why I love art so much and revel\nin exploring it.\nRewind 600 years to Renaissance\nportraiture and I find myself off the\ncouch and in the National Gallery being educated by my lovely friend and\nfelix contributor Rosie Milton about\nthe differences between the Italian and\nDutch portraits. Also soon to end, the\nexhibition is nothing short of fulfilling\nand just about the right size.\nNot strictly covered in this section,\nbut \u2018Waltz with Bashir\u2019 deserves a\nmention just for its graphics and some\nof its brilliantly choreographed sequences which would definitely put it\ninto the category of art despite being a\ndocumentary.\nI can be sure that a good number of\nyou will have attended some form of\nevent during the holidays and we are\ndying to hear about it, get it written\nnow before the work piles up!\nLast term the arts editors were all delighted as the articles kept on coming\nthick and strong throughout the whole\nterm from a large range of writers,\nmany new to Imperial which gave the\nsection a fresh new perspective.\nThe opportunity to review exhibi-tions, galleries, theatre, opera, concerts and more (free of charge, of\ncourse, just enquire within) will still be\navailable and we will be overjoyed and\nvery impressed if you manage to take\nsome time off throughout this hectic\nterm. We arts editors are but months\naway from our finals and for this reason there may be a drop in the weekly\nnumber of pages and occasionally this\nsection may only appear fortnightly.\nHelp us keep arts felix alive, email us\nwith your glorious words!\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nfor guests.\nThe unrest of the citizens of Russia\nwho could no longer see why the imperial family should remain living in such\nwealth soon initiated the end of the\ngolden age of the Tsars. From this exhibition we can see that the wealth of\nthe imperial Russian rulers will never\nagain reach such levels of pomp and\nsplendour \u2013 where a huge ermine mantle that hangs across to the floor over\n7 metres would have only been worn\nonce for the coronation and mere snuff\nboxes were encrusted with jewels.\nWalking around the exhibition\nmakes me wonder at the halls of the\nRussian palaces now and how memory\nof such times as the reign of the tsars\nexists now only in what is left of the\ncostume of these elegant people \u2013\nworn now only by ghosts of names of\nthe past. Such a wealth of goods and\ncostume seems very remote once I\u2019m\noutside the exhibition. But still, as I\npass the gift shop I buy myself a Faberg\u00e9 egg Christmas bauble, content in\nthe knowledge that I can be a part of\nthe magical Russian imperial kingdom,\nif only in my imagination.\nOpen until March 29\nwww.vam.ac.uk\nTop: The Winter Palace in St. Petersburg. Bottom: Coronation mantle of Empress Maria Fedorovna\nCoronation herald\u2019s tabard\nHere\u2019s to\nanother great\nyear for the arts\nOne of the many posters that left Emily Wilson underwhelmed\nYou can find us selling tickets in\nthe SAF or the JCR TODAY!!!!\n\n"
