After a couple of numbers Including Joni Mitchell' s \"Yllow Taxi\". They\nwere joined by Kenny - The Fiddler( from Slim Chance) whose playing at\ntimes was amazing and always entertain-ing. His piece \"de resistance\" was a \u2022\nrendering of \"The William Tell Overture\"\non jew ls harp - yes jew's harp! We were\ntreated to an encore of innuendo on group\nmanages.\nf\"l was the only one who could handle\nDaniel The Spaniel Superstar\"\nJohn Martyn kicked off with his oldie\n\"May you never\" .No one can deny, John's ski II on guitar and clever use of mixing\nand-echo. But his style does not have\nuniversal appeal. His dry humour and behaviour onstage is construed, by some,\nto be arrogance, but having talked to him\nI de not think this is so. He has now introduced drums into\nmany of his songs, \"Because I felt like\nit\". On the classic \"Bless The Weather\",\nI do not think they were entirely at home.\nJohn was accompanied on Double bass,\nas ever, by the energetic Danny Thompson, who excelled himself on this occasion. For the last two numbers they were\njoined by the legendary Paul Kossoff,\nwho appeared to have been kicked out at\nclosing time and just made it to the con-cert. He may have kept his fans happy\nbut this was not Paul Kossoff at his vintage best.\nFor the dedicated Martyn fans this was a concept to remember and for newcomers\nto his music it was a good advertisement.\nThe audience was warm and in John's words, \" A lot looser than the usual Loni don audience.\" The support band, having\nnow finished this tour, are forming Lucas and Mc Cull oh's Almanac. So watch out\nfor them they could be worth it.\nWhen asked what he was doing now,\nPaul Kassoff said he was getting a band\ntogether this week, so keep an eye out\nfor that too .\nJack Llewellyn David Gates: Never Let Her Go\n(Polydor)\nDAVID GATES has that rare quality\nwhich is so often lacking in the p seu d arena of the contemporary rock scene. It\nis called finesse, and Gates has it running out of his talented ears. Listening\nto Never Let Her Go is to return with a nostalgic sigh to the days when he was\nthe indispensable core of Bread, the soft-rock soph is toes, who tragically disbanded some two years ago. Although it could never be said that\nthis album is a stale pastiche of that\nband, it is nevertheless true to say that\nDavid Gates musical resources have remained un flawed and un expired. The style is exactly the same; it is simply\nthe orchestration that has undergone\nslight modification.\nCuts like \"Never let her go\", \"Part-time 'love\" and practically all of side\ntwo leave me despairing as to the validity of hard rock showing its grotesque\n(by comparison) face in public . Alright, alright. So maybe I'm an incurable romantic - it is just that this vi ry lis indisputably one of the best around at the\nmoment.\nRalph McTell: Streets (Warner Bros.)\nIT WAS inevitable after the success of the single \"Streets of London\", that\nWarner Bros, should follow it up with an\nalbum of Mc Tell singing mainly his own\nmaterial and including, of course, the\noriginal single as bait. The venture as\nsuch pays off handsomely: the talented\nMc Tell renders ample illustration of hi s ball adic versatility .\nMixed with tracks that are best described as \"typically folk\" are some superb ballads such as \"Grande Affaire\",\n\"Pity the Boy\" and \"Lunar Lullaby\"\nwhich, far from being harmonically trite,\nshow a maturity of perspective which\ntranscends the normal run-of-the-mill folk\ngarbage.\nFilms\nJames Wilkinson The Valley (obscured by clouds) .\nAs you may have guessed from the\nsecond part of the title the musical score\nof this film is written and performed by\nPink Floyd, so it starts with a point in its favour. The photography is excellent,\nthe actors are completely believable in\ntheir roles, and the music blends superbly into the action. However, despite all this, \"The Valley\" is for me a slight\ndisappointment. The theme lacks immediacy and at times the pace flags. If it is\ntry i ug to put over a message it eludes my\ngrasp. Briefly the plot concerns a French\nwoman who is initially in New Guinea to\nprocure Bird of Paradise feathers but becomes involved with a hippy (not too\nclich e) expedition in search of the valley\nof the title, which is a blank on the map\nbeing obscured by clouds. Filmed on location the actors mingle with unrehearsed\nnatives of the Mapuga tribe during the\nstory, before they continue their guest.\nThe ending was the type I hate -inconclusive. The part that sticks in my mind (be sid es the quick erotic bits) is the opening\nphotography to the accompaniment of Pink Floyd. Not a film to see for the story; but\nworth catching for its artistic quality.\nJack Llewellyn Peter Fonda, Susan George: Dirty\nMary Crazy Larry (20th Century Fox,\nDirector: John Hough)\nTHIS FILM is a reasonably mediocre\nattempt to entertain the audience with a succession of motor car stunts and little\nelse. The attempt fails dismally .\nPeter Fonda of \"Easy Rider\" fame\nplays ' Crazy Larry,', a speed freak with\nambitions for big-time motor racing. With\nhis side - kick mechanic, Deke (Adam\nRourke), he picks up with 'Dirty Mary'\n(Susan George), who by all accounts is a whore, but this aspect is never illustrated\n(sexist! - Ed.). After having robbed a. supermarket cash office, the rest of the\nfilm is devoted to the police chase that\nensues. Whilst the plot is a bore, the subplots had a lot of potential. Pity that they\nwere left open ended and never exploited.\nAll the car stunts have been done be-fore; there is a sprinkling of four letter\nwords, hence the X certificate; all in all, this film is one that will only appeal t cr car-chase addicts.\nJohn Andrews Thomas Pynchon: Gravity's Rainbow\n(Pacador).\nThis is a mammoth piece of work not\nonly in volume, and to be able to swallow\nit all in one helping would require a perceptive mind the like of which is not often\nfound amongst scientists, or most other\nspecies of mortals .\nOne reviewer of this book said that most\nother novels are really a bit trivial when\ncompared to this, and he was right . Mr Pynchon' s imagination is matched only by\nhis talent as a writer; into this bubbling\ncauldron of a book he throws sex, biology,\nwar psychology, love, organic chemistry,\nhumour... I could add a lot more .It is often\nerotic, often very funny (sometimes at the\nsame time); it also has its moments of sad ness and serious comment.\nPaul Ek pen yong Facts in Focus\nThe book is compiled by the Central\nStatistical office and is essentially a summary of the more Important statistical figures In paperback for the mere pl t ance of 6 0 pA wide range of topics are looked\nat with data on EEC countries and a few\ncomparisons with the major industrialised\ncountries such as the USA.

Noticeboards, walls, windows, doors - anything in fact, that will hold a drawing pin or sell o tape have\nall been defiled by a multitude of posters and bump h, each and everyone\nscreaming out for attention. Bold words\nhave been spoken, promises have been\nmade. The old chestnut of student\napathy and U GM attendances have been\ngiven their perfunctory airings. Publicity machines have been furiously\ngrinding out the pearls of wisdom, the\nhopeful messages and adherent clich es. What will come of it all? At the time\nof writing, (Wednesday afternoon) it is not at all certain that the ICU elections\nwill be quo rate. A threshold of about\n1050 voters is necessary to make the\nelections valid if the threshold is not\nreached, new elections will have to be\nheld, new slogans will have to be\nthought up, candidates will be called upon to make even greater efforts with\ntheir campaigning.\nNaturally, if the elections are quo-rate, then let us congratulate the victors and com mis u rate with the not-so-lucky . But if the elections are deemed\ninvalid, then some people are going to\nhave to do a lot of hard thinking with\nregard to their future.\nThe demonstration for fairer grants\nlast Friday appears to have been a success. A15,000 turn-out nevertheless be\nremembered that there were Welsh and\nseen in the perspective of the fact that\nWelsh and Scottish demos were being\nheld simultaneously can only rate as a success in terms of participation. The\nturn-out from IC was 50% higher than\nthat recorded for the last demo: a new\nsession al high of sixty students. Trev.\nPhillips was extremely disappointed,\nand justify ably so.\nThe question now being asked is> How many of those who have recently\nstood up and endorsed the fighting of\nthe proposed education cuts were on\nthat demo?\nMore developments next week.\nI.I E77 IE3S Dept. of Mathematics,\nImperial College .\nDear Sir,\nMs. List z' s analysis of pinball as an outlet of repressed\nsexual impulses is essentially\ncorrect. Of course, minor points\nare open to dispute.S he does\nnot explain the deep satisfied\nclicks and shirrs the machine\nmakes when a ball is lost down\nthe hole. Furthermore, my personal skill( or lack of skill) is\nsuch that I never get a replay.\nThis does not mean that I derive no satisfaction from the\ngame.However, let us not argue on technicalities. In her conclusion, Ms. List z condemns \"sex substitutes\"\nsuch as the phallic pinball\nmachine, Theta, and the Queen's Tower. May I point out\nthat there is a sex ratio of 10:\n1 in I.C. clearly, some substitute is more glorious, more maj-e stic, more ...imperial than the\nnoble art of pinball?\nYours faithfully\nDavid Cooper\nDept. of Chemical Engineering\nImperial College\n26th February 1975\nDear Mr Williams\nI am writing to you to protest about the pulling down of\nposters around College at\nUnion Election times. It is oom mon practice of the societies at Imperial College that\nno posters put up by other\nsocieties advertising future\nevents are pulled down, but\nthose which are out of date\ncan be. Although College Un ion pays for the posters through\nSC C/RC C, they are still expensive and account for a reasonable percentage of the\nsocieties annual grant from the\nUnion.\nOn Monday (February 24th) two posters were placed in the\nJ CR near the door, and on Tuesday (February 25th) they had\nbeen replaced by a poster of a person standing for a Union office. There were many blank\nsections of wall where this\nposter could have been placed but they were not well positioned. If everyone practised this\nhabit, NO POSTERS would remain up for more than a few\nhours, and no-one would know\nif any meetings of interest to\nhim or her were occur ing that\nlunch time. I appeal to people to stop\nthis habit of pulling down\nposters around College.\nYours faithfully,\nL.J.

Not\nonly is the standard of food\nlow, but also that of service .\nTo quote but one example;\non Thursday last I went down\nto the Union Refectory at 3pm in the hope of buying a late\nlunch.

They arrived on time\nbut of course we didn't,( did we Terry?)\nThe game eventually started at 11.00am with our favourite\nreferee, Gordon, blowing the whistle (occasionally). IC burnt off\nto a roaring start and within five minutes Hughes had s nook in near the comer flag for al st XV v Welsh Guards good team try. The Agentini an s fought back well and did\nwell to keep IC at bay for the\nrest of the half and at half time\nthe match was evenly poised with the score at 4 - 0 to IC. For the third quarter the\nmatch was again rather furious\nand very even. The inexperienced Argentinians f re qu end y went unpunished when offside\nin both ruc k and maul. F rust ration was rife among the IC forwards and some dirty play\nwas beginning to creep in. The\nstalemate was broken by a Terry Fearn try. A movement\ndown the right wing moved in side with Fatman in support\nand a badly timed pass found\nFe am who dived over to give\nICa convincing 8 - 0 lead.\nThe Argentinians came back\nstrongly with what can only be\ndescribed as over robust play.\nAfter a maul in which the Argentians were blatantly guilty\nof off side Austin took matters\ninto his own hands, so to\nspeak. Retribution was exacted\nin the next scrum when Austin emerged with a bruised and cut\neye and was forced to retire.\nOnly ten minutes remained but\nthey were to be ten minutes of\nmisery for IC. Almost immediately Buenos Aires ran in for\nan un converted try. Shortly\nafterwards poor tackling brought a well converted try by the\nArgentinians and this was followed by another goal in the\nlast minute of the match. Disappointingly IC had somehow\nlost by 16 - 8.\nTeam: B. Finney, R. Stern. M. Colter, D. Forbes, G. Clement,\nR. Hughes, T. Fearn, B. Bradley,\nR. Austin, D. Hart, K. Lipscombe,\nS. Booth, J.

Rapid rearrangements followed. By2.15 a full\nside was present at Harlington\nand watched as' A' gave some\nlast minute instruction on how\nto kick. Three o' clock saw the\nscore at IC15. Guards - 0 .\nThey still hadn't arrived. But\nthe sun was shining so the\nteam sat down to iced tea and\nbus cu its. Within the hour the tumble\nof a ten - ton truck (complete\nwith cage and Major) was\nheard approaching.\nOut of the truck climbed\ntwelve men and their captain,\nMajor. \" Sorry we're late\nchaps\".\" That' sO. K., MajorC apt a in\". Now to get changed.\nKickoff was at 15.15 hundred hours, so it was no surprise that IC were tired from\nthe start. The Bandits burst\noff to a vigorous start and\ncompletely dominated the\nGuard's XIII in both set and\nloose. Results came rapidly\nwith Zapper running in a fine\ntry from his own half after a well timed (?) pass from the\nPot. Unfortunately no conversion. Back in the front row,\nAustin was giving his opposite\nnumber a veritable lesson, who responded by kicking young Bob's knees in appreciation. Realizing that they were in complete control, the IC pack\nleft the field for tea and biscuits. They clapped appreciatively from the touch line as Mr\nT. Fear n( arrived on Time) intercepted a pass and dashed\ndown the pitch to score a fine\ntry under the posts. Try converted by Forbes. The Guards made a surprise\ncome-back while the pack called for seconds. The score\nwas 10 - 6.\nThe pack was then forced to\nreturn to the pitch. But no-one\nwas really interested anymore,\nso the ICl st XV beat the\npride of the British Army 10 -6.

The\ncricket in gall stars of the hockey club are in practice for\nthe summer season . Arriving at the Bans ground early\n(makes a change) we found no\nopposition awaiting our arrival\nand so took to the cricket field By the time Facts had turned\nup\nup the score board read; IC\n( M CQ5 for 10, sleepy 5,\nPeter Lever Maclean 2 wickets, Extras:2 no balls( Hodge).\nIt was obvious from the\nstart that IC were going to win as Facts had not supplied an\nUmpire and consequently according to League Rules they\nloose 5-0. Despite this easy\nvictory IC set out to prove\nthey were worthy of the two\npoints and playing up hill in the first half press uri sed the\nBarts defence throughout without actually scoring.\nCongratulations all in order\nfor ' Kickers' Huts in who performed a magnificent clear en ce when called upon to touch the\nball for his first and last time\nin the game. Anyone wishing to join the supporters club contact our out-of-work goalkeeper.\nHalf time arrived with the\nscore 0-0 and then shortly\nafterwards, while IC were\nstill noshing oranges, Barts scored from a well taken short\ncomer. Motivated by this sur-p rise goal IC swiftly struck\nback. What we had been threatening to do in the first half we\ndid in the second.

Our first\nmistake of the afternoon was\nto arrive on time as Silverwing\ndidn't but eventually everyone\nwas ready for the bully off.\nTje \" Fu hrer\" drew first blood\nby winning the toss. IC started in their usual dynamic manner and within five minutes\nhad taken the lead through\nSleepy who woke up first in time to put the ball in the net\nafter a superb dummy by Superstrap!! We soon went further\nahead when Superstrap bemused the Silverwing defence\nwith a brilliant solo run before\nscoring. Half time arrived with\nIC in comfortable 2 - 0 lead.\nUnfortunately, the second half contained a few unpleasant\nincidents, notably when a Silverwing defender decided to\nrearrange the shape of Hopal on g's left knee cap causing him to take a brief rest. Superstrap then decided to return the\ncompliment with the net t result that both he and the Silverwing defender were sent off\nfor five minutes (Nice one\nSuperstar!!) These incidents\ntended to interrupt the flow of\nthe game and the match became very scrappy until the\nlast quarter of the game when\nIC regained their rhythm. It\nwas in the period that IC scored their third goal. A beautiful\nclearance by Tin Whisde found\nHotshot on the right wing and\nalthough his cross was half cleared the hockey club's one\nand only O. A.P.( complete\nwith wheelchair) was on hand\nto put the ball into the vacant\ngoal. This was once again a good\noverall team performance. The defence was as sound as ever\nwith Pop Babe having a very\nsteady game at left back.

On arriving at\nthe ground a hour early we\nmanaged to get wet (It's the\nrain you know) before the\nmatch. In the first half IC looked the better team and tie lead when Dave.(I can do it too!) hard pushed the ball through their keepers legs. An amazing feat considering he\nwas playing without his pre\nmatch pint (A great blow to\nhim) Later in this half Tim Marshall hit the post after a brilliant dribble (Inspired by\nhis spectator, No doubt) and\nleft Sarah Horn no problem in\nscoring our second .Ignoring\nthe incidents at half time when\none of our spectators ran on to\nthe pitch, I shall pass on to\nthe second half. In this half\nIC did not look so impressive\nand were lucky to hang on to\ntheir lead, and unbeaten re-cord.\nAfter the match came the\nmost important part of the day,\nthe FREE Guinness and Harp\nla gar, which Tim and Dave\nconsumed most of the day,\nculminated with Dave (I feel\nsilly Holding it) B alderson making us walk half a mile,\nneedlessly.

Henry III despatched a series of letters on 3 May 1231\nto the sheriffs of the shires of\nOxford and Cambridge and to\nthe mayors and bailiffs of the\ntwo towns. Each sheriff was to\nco-operate with the bishop of\nthe diocese and the chancellor\nof die university in repressing\n'rebellious and incorrigible'\nstudents, especially those\nmalefactors among the student\nbody, who'pretend to be clerks\nand are not'.

I do of course have no\nobjection to all students knowing where Union funds go, but\nthe circumstances in which Mr\nSpencer disclosed this est i mate, which has not yet been\nconsidered for approval, may\nprejudice certain negotiations\nat many levels. As is quite often the case when people\nspeak about things which they\nare not dire cd y concerned with\n(or not yet concerned with in\nthis case), the basic facts\nwere wrong . The number of\nstudent members of the Gliding Club is about fifty and not\nabout twenty as was stated,\nand in addition there are about\nthirty members of staff and life\nmembers (who pay a higher sub-script ion) in the club, making\nit hardly a minority club.2) A more important point\nis whether, what Mr Spencer\ncalls minority clubs should\nhave a right to exist if the\nUnion's budget were to be re-duce d. There are bound to be\ndifferent views on this, but if\none looks up the \"Objects of\nICU By-Laws\" the first two,\nout of the three objects, are:\na) The promotion of social\nintercom r se between present\nand past students and academic\nstaff of the Imperial College.\nb) The encouragement of\ninterest by students in matters\noutside the College cirri cul um, especially cultural and athletic\ninterests. It is to further these\nobjects that Union clubs are\nset up, and the wider the variety of clubs the more success fully these objects can be ful-filed. Such objects mean that\nany of the clubs in Imperial\nCollege cannot be a commer-cia l enterprise and hence trying to apply 'cost-effective-ness', as Mr Spencer implied\nhe would like to do, could\nthreaten the existence of many\nclubs.

Yours sincerely,\nG.R. Can ser( Chairman, Recreational\nClubs Committee)\nImperial College\n1st March 1974.\nDear Sir,\nI was horrified to hear of\nthe criminal proposals made\nin the NUS document, relating\nto student sit-ins, entitled\n' Direct Action Briefing'. For those of you who have not read\nthe reports I will quote from\nthe Guardian: 'A guide, which\nincludes advice on the laws of\ntrespass, use of drugs and\ndrink, and, more cont rovers i ally, recommends photocopying\n\"incriminating documents\"\nwas sent out two weeks ago to\nabout Q00 student unions\nunder \"General Hints\" comes\nthe advice: Files can be very\nrevealing, a lot of dirt can be\nfound out about the authorities;\nevery use should be made of\nsuch information.\"\nI cannot believe that such a document can do anything other\nthan alienate public opinion.\nMr J. Randall said on LBC, \"It\nwas a private communication to\nstudent union presidents and\nhence not intended for public-ation.\" Now it is we, the stu-dents, who are responsible for\nthe activities of the NUS, and\nwe are the ones who suffer\neventually. Hence I believe Mr\nPhillips should release the\ndocument at the next U GM, where we can publicly reject\nits intentions.\nThis leads to my next point\n- to quote from the Broad Left statement in last weeks Sennet;\n\"Conference is the Governing\nBody of NUS and decides policy which is a consensus not\nbinding on local unions and\ntheir membership unless they\naccept it at their won General\nMeetings.\" At present it seems\nthat NUS proposals are accepted at IC almost without ques-tion, hence a change in our\nconstitution is in order. A motion such as 'all matters relating to NUS policy should be\nadopted at IC only after they\nhave been accepted by aqu or ate UGM'. would ensure not\nonly debate of NUS policy as\nit happens, but, in concentrating more power in the IC Union, create more interest in our own\nUG Ms( any comments Mr\nTeague?)\nNow I must comment on NUS demos. While Mr Phillips states\nthat 'public reaction on the\nroute of a march is in general\nsympathetic or indifferent', the\nobvious flaw in this argument\nis that most people are not on\nthe route of a march, but hear\nabout student demos through\nthe media, where they have\nlittle acclaim. Incidentally\nyesterdays demonstration of\nabout 12,000 studen s was completely overshadowed by the\ntragic Moorgate disaster. In the\ntwo papers I have read this\nmorning the demo got a total\nof one photograph and four lin es. I think to obtain public\nsupport and at the same time\nto publicize our cause we must\nfirst separate university and\npolytechnic students whose\naims are entirely different, and\nrecognise that a grants increase is useless if it means\nsolely an increase in the parental contribution. I propose\nan entirely different kind of\ndemo. It may be idealistic to\nsuggest, but I think 1000\nstudents sitting on the pavement outside Westminster, not\nshouting, but reading and stud-ying, would, by its shear originality gain public sympathy\nthrough the media.\nFinally, Isp ecu alte as to\nhow Mr T. Randall would feel if\nhis union office were to be\noccupied on the basis of his own proposals!\nYours sincerely\nFrancis To ye Physics 2\nImperial College\nDear Sir,\nIt is with great trepidation\nthat I must comment on the\ncorrespondence of our Jung\nFreud and I hope all can endure my analysis. However strong the lady' s views are, to take the pen\n(phallic conn at at ions not only\nby shape but also by name)\nand putting it to white paper\nrepresenting the virgin, and\nthen stroke it back and forth\nwith a sustained rhythm until a final climax is reached with a flourish, namely the signature\nrepresenting the need for\nattention, a pointing out of a sexual deprivation, can only be interpreted as a masturbation fantasy of the first order.\nThough for personal satis fac, tion. I would rather use a type-writer.\nMay we all find our own\ntruth, se curt y and virtue.\nFloreat Coitus! Maxwell Wrigley\n\n"

It traces the history\nof these ideas, which are not\nnew and know the uses to\nwhich they have been put (eg\njustifying the murder of Jews by the Nazis) and those to\nwhich they are being put now,\n(cf the call by the National\nFront for the repatriation of\ncoloured people.\nThe authors separate three\nstrands of the argument; (i) a tendency to assume that biological differences cause racial differences; (ii) arising from (i), they claim that any\naspect of human behaviour\narises from genetics and environment and that these are sep-arable; (iii) belief that IQ tests\nmeasure pure culture - free intelligence, known as\" g\". When different racial groups\nand class groups are tested\nfor IQ, there are differences in\nthe averages obtained. Ey sen k and Jensen ask, \"how much ot\nthe difference is due to genetics and how much to en v iron ment?\" The authors show that\nthis question is meaningless,\nin essence because genetics\nInfluence the environment and\nvice-verse a.

ENG ALL INVITED ment s the name group of genes\ncan produce different characteristics, thus there are no\nsuch things as \"high IQ genes\"\nor \"low IQ genes,\" which are\nessential to the Ey sen k/ Jensen theory.\nEy sen k and Jensen would\nprobably concede that the contribution of genetics and of\nenvironment to a particular\ntrait like intelligence is not\nmeaningful for an individual,\nbut would claim that they can\nbe neas u red for a population.\nThey define heritability as the\nratio of the intelligence difference between members of\nthe name population due to\ngenetics to the total in tell i gence difference. A population\nbeing a group of people with\nsimilar genotypes. For white\npopulations they give a figure\nof 0.8. But this heritability\ncalculation cannot be used to\nset limits to genetic or environmental influence, due to the\ninteraction mentioned earlier,\nthey are thus useless for their\nintended purpose.\nThe authors then indicate\nthat IQ tests do not measure\nF'j re intelligence, but only the\npossession of certain skills determined by those setting\nthe test.\nThus the authors destroy\nthe Ey sen k/ Jensen theory and\nexpose the worth less ness of\nthe evidence (IQ scores) which\nEy sen k and Jensen then use to\nprove the supposed inferiority,\nand others to prove the biological imperative of the present\nposition of these groups in\nsociety.

Peter Teague\nRichard & Linda Thompson\nMANY people have been asking who this \"minority interest\"\nduo who are appearing in college tomorrow night. Here is a short\nmusical history: \u2022\nRichard Thompson played stylish electric guitar in Fairport\nConvention in its early days of 1968, when it was regarded as a folk group. He wrote songs\nsuch as ' ' No Man's LancT',\n\"Tale in Hard Time\", and\nthe classic\" Me ef On The\nLedge\". He stayed with the\nband through numerous changes of musical policy, and contributed many more notable\nsongs on later albums, among\nthem \"Cajun Woman\", \"Gene-sis Hall\", \"Farewell, Farewell\", and \"Crazy Man Michael\".\nWhen he left Fairport In\n1971, he dropped out of the\nlimelight, but was still working in a folk duo with Linda Peters, who later became his wife, and did many sessions for old friends, including\nSandy Denny and Andy Roberts\nRichards guitar playing has\nalways been notable for its\neconomy, and his first solo al bum, \"Henry The Human Fly\",\nwas a typically low-key and\nengaging record. The com in a tion of Richard's guitar and\ngrowing songwriting ability\nwith Linda' s warm, strong\nvocals proved virtually ir resist able. Unfortunately the birth of\nthe Thompson's daughter limited the duo's live appearances,\nbut they did play support on\nthe British part of Traltic's1974 World Tour.\nIn their new album, \"Hokey\nPokey\", Richard plays guitar,\nmandolin dulcimers, and piano,\nas well as sharing the lead\nvocals with his wife. All but\none of the songs are by Rich ard, and they vary enormously\nfrom the title track to the\nsadly reflective \"/'// regret it\nall in the morning\".\nYou can see them live on\nstage tomorrow night in the\nGreat Hall at 8.00pm.

There are a number of places available for students wanting a second year in residence. This number is fixed at 12% of\nthe total number of places in the respective Hall or House.\nHence if you want to be one of the lucky 12% get a form at the\nbeginning of March from the Residence Office, Room 161 College Block .The successful re applicants are chosen by a committee\nconsisting of students in that Hall or House who are chosen by\nthe Warden according to his wishes.2).18% of the places in Halls and Houses are designated\nfor postgraduates. This has been increased from 15% recently\nas the demand for places has now increased to about six app li cants to one place, (similarly for the re applicants, up from 10%\nto 12%). The extra 3% will be accommodated entirely in the\nHalls because the House Wardens have difficulty in getting\npostgraduates in shared rooms. An important point which postgraduates may not know is that any years in residence as an\nundergraduate are discounted and hence selection is random.\n3) .

Staff members may apply for these and their applications are considered\nby the Wardens.\n6) . A small number of places exist for University Exchange\nto accommodate visitors.7). The remaining group of places are allocated to fresher s and scholars. Half of the places in Halls and Houses are for\nfresher s who are nominated by their prospective department.\nThere are 35 places (included in the fresher s places) for students who obtain either a Royal or Entrance Scholarship which carry the option of having the first year in residence.

    "content": "FELIX SPORT CROSS COUNTRY\nFollowing crushing victories over Brunch and Surrey in Uxbridge, and a best-ever performance (ell, rect ly anyway) in the\nH PR, the X Country Club tru ned its attention to UC and LSE at Shenley over their usual pasture and mud, hilly,5 M mile steeplechase course. Even the absence of one Ellis, I.( very formal\nthis), laid up in dry dock after\nan unfortunate confrontation\nwith hard reality, could not\nalter the inevitable (ie we *\nwon), though it was deemed\nthe cause of the very slow\nstart - even Dave Payne was\nin the lead at one stage. The\nproblem of the absence of a stopwatch and anyone to hold\nit was solved, this time, by\nthe Rob All in son wristwatch,\nwire mash and first-home tech-ni que: this might have gone\nawry had he and Steve Webb\nbeen at all pushed, but the\nopposition was so far behind\nthat they could just coast\nhome. Steve was given first\nplace in 32m10s, his first\never win.( Pause for cheers.)\nSO CCFf tls t XI v Royal Holloway\nThe most important league seen by all except the ref, to\ngame of the season for IC first handle in the process. RefusXI took place on the 22nd when ing to give up, IC pressed\nthey played Royal Holloway even harder for the elusive\nfirst XI in a top of the table equalise r, and it eventually\nclash. Before the game IC were Came when Ian Postlethwaite,\nthe only side who could con-cie v ably take the league leadership from Royal Holloway\nand the only if they managed\nto win. The game, played in ideal\nconditions with the sun shining and the pitch reason aly soft underfoot, started briskly\nwith Holloway showing why\nthey are top of the table by\nplaying some attractive posse s sion football, and in the\nearly stage s bewildering the\nopposition. As the game pro-gres sed, however, IC came\nmore and more into the play\nand started using their midfield trio to set up some dangerous moves and were very un-lucky not to take the lead on\na number of occasions. For\nlong periods IC be sig ed their\nopponents half but paid the\npenalty of pushing too far forward when Holloway made a quick break and scored the\nfirst goal against the run of\nplay.\nThe second half was a simi lar state of affairs with IC\nlooking much the better team\nand attacking the Holloway\ngoal relentlessly. Boby Day\nhad a superb effort virtually\npulled out of the net by the\nHolloway keeper who 1 e apt across the goal mouth to make\na Gordon Banks type save.\nShortly afterwards Dave Rudd,\nwho had a good game up front,\nstruck a perfect ball to the\nnear post only to see it cleared by the full back who was\nwhose powerful runs down the\nmiddle of the field have been\na feature of IC play this seas-on, made a solo burst to the\nedge of the area and had his\nshot deflected past the sprawling goalkeeper who almost\ndenied the lads of an equalise r again.\nThe last twenty minutes\nsaw IC tire badly thus allowing Royal Holloway back into\nthe game and but for al it de bit of luck they might well\nhave snatched victory in the\nclosing stages of the game.\nThe game ended in a11 draw and IC l st can count\nthemselves as very unlucky\nnot to have won. All credit must be given to Royal Holl o way who are a fine footballing\nside and I think well deserve\nthe league title which they\nmust now surely collect.\nOn a more personal note,\nthe game marked one of the\nlast appearence s for IC by\nBob Day who leaves the\ncollege (and the football club)\nto go and \"work in .Viuili\nAfn ca on the 14th of this\nmonth after almost 10 years\nloyal service. Br Day who\nclaims he was football club\nfixture secretary in 66 - 67,\n(there's no one here old enough\nto remember that far back) has\nplayed every season while at\ncollege for the club and in recent years has been a regular\nmember of the l st team . All members of the club wish him\nwell in his new \" career\". Paul Clarke was ahead of two\nfrom UC, one of whom had the\nmi s fortune to get lost on his\nown, course, thus giving Paul\nthird place. Next to plough\nhome (is this wit?) was Dave\nHoulbrooke followed by a right\nmotley collection: Dave Jones,\nRich Harrington, Dave Payne,\nMike, Pete, Pad and, starting\nlike all good ' uns, Mr One-Lap\nHunter. There being only three\nto count, the opposition were\nsomewhat overwhelmed by our\ntaking the first three places. The same was not true in the\nHonorary Footabll Match that\nfollowed: we lost 7 - 2 despite\nthe inspiration of sharing (al-most) dressing-rooms with the\nArsenal squad. Hero of the\nmatch was Dave Payne. ( Three times this week, is this a re-cord? )\nSaturday, the day of the\nNationals, was unusual. Where\nwere the rain, sleet and snow\nwe had come to expect? The\nNational Cross Country Championships were held this year in Luton over d singularly dry\ncourse on which even the ploughed fields were rock hard,\nthe only thing to distinguish it\nfrom Crystal Palace track being an inordinately steep hill of more than sufficient length\nto make anyone regret they had\never set out. In the Junior\nrace, twice round this three\nmile lap, were three stars\nfrom IC. Placed well up in\nthis three mile lap, were three\nstars from IC. Placed in this\nfield of almost 500 was Ian\nEllis at 251'st, finding good\napplication for his re balanced gyros on the downhill plough\nsection. Even further up, in\nfact almost up with the famous,\nper hao s' s and maybe's was\nRob All in son in 131st place.\nJust behind the main bunch,\nMike Welford put in a fine performance finishing 401'st and\nAn Example To Us All. The sun is well known in\nSouth Ken for bringing out cro-co dile s: in Luton on Saturday\nit attracted one 1400 people\nalong. This was the Seniors'\nrace: 9 miles long and three\ntimes up that hill. The great\ncheer at the start came not so\nmuch from the spectators but\nfrom the runners themselves\nat the \"Oiarge of the Light Brigade\" commentary: at least\none arm was raised bearing an\nappropriate answering gesture.\nAmong those actually in the\nrace was Steve Webb finishing\n5 l6' th, a gain of 250 on his\nprevious best and nearly 400\non last year. Somewhere among\nthe also-ran's was Dave Jones\n(wearing number 999 but giving no al arum on this ex cur sion) in697 'th position and\namong the almost-ran's, in\n985'th, was Ian l sherwood.

And so it was\nover for another year, we were\nleft only the stroll back to\nthe station seeing the sights\nof Luton: e.g. Moss Bros' sga so meter. At the station we\nwere greeted with a performance by the Sugar Lump Fairies; this gave cause for Steve\nWebb to sprint across the\nbridge with amazing alacrity;\ntwelve miles( this Tad takes\nthree to warm up) and then this\nwell!! this speed was sadly\nnot matched by BR on the journey home, during which there\nwas some talk of an 8 mile\nrun the following morning: the\nwise pretended to be asleep.\nDARTS FR EML IN FINALS THIS YEAR'S 'FREMLIN' SINGLES FINALS WILL\nTAKE PLACE ON NEXT MONDAY 10TH MARCH IN\nTHE UNION BAR.\nCOME ALONG AND SUPPORT\nSURE TO BE A GOOD NIGHT\n\n"

    "content": "4\nFELIX\nJ PREC3 P3CE\nA number of students have recently\nasked me to explain some of the factors\nconcerned with my nomination to a vice-presidency of the NUS, and what I intend\nto do. Perhaps I can take a short while\nhere to clarify my position.\nFirst, the mechanics: as President of\nULUI will be a sabbatical officer of\nUL U; as a vice-president of NUS I would\nnot be sabbatical. There are, in fact only\nfour full-time officers of the NUS President, Deputy President, Secretary, and\nTreasurer. The obvious reason for this is that the National Executive dominated,\nnot by full-timers based in End sleigh Street but by \"ordinary students\", and\nsab bet ical officers in direct touch with student needs. That way the Executive is not isolated from the student body it-self.\nThe second point concerns my own\nregistration. I am standing for election as\na student of Imperial College. I am flattered that so many people have indicated\n.that they would wish me to remain a student of IC( nominally, at least) for\nthe next year. I should point out that my\nonly reservation was whether this would\nbe acceptable to the College; my allegiances, as a student, have always been\nto IC, even when the Union has taken\nreactionary backward positions which in my opinion, acted against its own inter-est s. They remain so. With regard to LSE their reputation is an undeserved one,\nand my interest was in terms of a course\nof study, not bashing in the gates, or the\nDirector.\n*\nThe other major point is the fact that\n1 am standing as the candidate of the\nBroad Left. People have asked me what\nthe Broad Left is, and why I am part of it. The space allowed here is not enough to\noutline this fully, but I will try to give\nsome ideas about the nature of the Broad\nLeft in a few paragraphs.\nEssentially, the BLis an alliance of\nstudents - Left Labour (mostly from the\n\" Clause4\" group, which identifies\nwith the Tribune group of MP*s), Commu nist s, and non-aligned socialists like myself. We take part in that alliance because we have a broadly similar conception of the role of students in today's Most people at IC have now heard of the\nnewly formed \"Women in Science\" group\nwithout knowing why it exists and what\nare its aims. There seems to have been\na lot of misrepresentation as we have\nbeen branded polit cal, women's lib be rs who are out to destroy ICWA THIS IS\nNONSENSE as anyone who has had anything to do with the group knows.\n\"Women in Science\" exists to promote\ninterest in science among women, to encourage more women into science, to investigate any prejudice against women\nscientists and to study the attitude of\nscientific research towards women.\nWhen a group was started at IC the\naims of the group were formulated on two\nlevels, women in science generally and\nsociety. The Broad Left tries to put forward policies that the mass of students\ncan ident iy with and unite behind, in fighting to defend their educational and\nliving standards - thus the aim of bu il ding strong student unions which can fight\non questions like Grants, education cuts,\nand housing.\nAll students within the Broad Left see\nthe interests of students as being linked to those of working people, because it is not only students who suffer from a lack of educational provision, or of accommodation .Therefore, we cannot operate independant ly of those working people or\nfind separate solutions to the problems.\nAs a member of the B L,I feel that student unions should tackle these problems\nalongside the organisations of working\npeople - the Trades Unions. This goes\nboth for national and local level s.Ik bow that it is sometimes difficult\nfor students to distinguish between different \" lefty\" groups. However, I would\nsay that we differ from the other major\nleft wing group, the Ultra-left, as sig rif i cant ly as we differ from the Right in student unions . The Ultra-left do not believe that it is worthwhile fighting on\n\"student questions\" or trying to unite\nmost students on particular issues. They\nwould rather try to win a small number of\nstudents directly to \"revolutionary soci al is m\", an approach which we stra n^ ty\nreject, for this only results in dividing students, in alienation, in students being\n\" pissed off\" with the Union, and apathy.\nThe Right wing( as exemplified by\nRAG, the Liberals, and the Tories) in. student unions essentially attempt to do\nmuch the same - divide students, weaken\nstudent unions as campaigning bodies, to\ngenerate a\" do nothing\" atmosphere. The fact that the Ultra Left and Right often\nteam up, as at LSE recently .where they\ntried to discredit the Union, by setting\nludicrous demands, and calling for tact-ics which were totally unrealistic in that\nsituation (ultima tion to the Director,\noccupations, etc) shows how interested\nthey are in students' welfare.\nFundamentally, I see the Broad Left as an organisation which will try to unite\nstudents in fighting in their won interests\nKarenGa dd women in science at IC . This lead to\ndiscussions about social welfare of the\nwomen at IC and we all agreed that there\nis a lot to be done not only for the women\nbut for everyone here and that the women\nin science group is as good a starting\nplace as any. With this in mind the organisation of a \"Flatshare\" centre is being\nundertaken and should start work next\nterm. Other social welfare campaigns for\nimprovement of the health centre, and the\nprovision of family planning service are\nbeing discussed and it is hoped that we\nwill get widespread support from people\nat IC who are outside our group.\nThe aims of \"Women in Science\" are\nbeing outlined and emphasised by the\norganisation of lectures and debates, the\nTrevor Phillips\n- and in the present situation, the interests of the education sector as a whole;\none which can provide the in d of leadership that the NUS( and student unions)\nneeds. That is why I stand as a Broad\nLeft candidate\n*\nAnyone want to buy aBL Journal?\nOnly lOp.\n*\nAfter all the talk of \"free speech\" lately I would like to point to what I regard as a real limitation on the free\nspeech of some Union members. I refer\nto students who belong to the Services.\nMany of these students feel that they can not take part in\" political\" activity as students, because of possible repercussions on their careers in the Services.\nEven the National Demo was considered\n\" too much\" for them.\nI consider this a scandalous situation.\nWhether these students ate \" right\" or\n\" left\", they should be allowed to speak\nout on issues, just as much as any other\nmember of the Union and take part in activity open to other students.\nThe sooner the Services stop pretend-ing that soldiers, etc. are machines and\nrealise that they are human beings with\nviews the better it will be for them.\nPOSTGRADUATES\nNEW ARRANGEMENTS\nFOR\nHALL & HOUSE APPLICATIONS\nThose going into 2nd or 3rd year\nshould apply by 21st March, so that\nplaces can be allocated by June.\nThe closing date for those beginning\na PG course next year remains at 1st August.\nIDA GLASER\nICU WELFARE OFFICER\nfirst of which took place last week and\nwas very successful. It attracted women\nfrom other London Colleges, fifth and\nsixth former s and some women who have\nmade their careers in science and engineering. The \"Women in Science\" group at IC\nis organising surveys to study attitudes\ntowards girls who apply for industrial\nsponsorships, and the attitudes third\nyear female students face at interviews\nfor jobs. In both of these, incidences of\nb latent discrimination have been reveal-ed, how widespread is the prejudice, and\nit which areas it most frequently occurs.\nI consider it important that we emphasise that we are a non-political group,\nthat we consider our aims sensible and\nimportant. Anyone who dismisses us as\n\"just more Women's Lib\" is clearly in capable of considering any moves against injustice and intolerance as worth -while. We welcome ANYONE who wishes\nto attend our meetings which are held\nWednesday lunchtimes in the ICWA\nlounge - if you are interested in our\ngroup or any one of the aims of our group,\ncome along to a meeting and bring any\nideas.

    "content": "FELIX 3\n.science\nlor People Pete Glass OCCASIONALLY in our more critical moments we may ask ourselves - what are we doing here, for what end, is that end\nworthwhile or interesting even? It was interesting to note the\npacked lecture theatre in last week's General Studies 'Horizon'\nfilm \"Science is dead - Long live science\" obviously there is a widespread concern and awareness that all Is not 100%\nrosy in the world of science and technology. However,\nthese concerns tend not to\nget expressed vociferously In\na college dedicated to the\nsingle minded training of scientists and engineers without\nencouraging us to ask 'what\nis it tor?' Thus the demarcation between the \" two cultures\" is maintained.\nThe IC Science for People\ngroup (society for social responsibility In science) exists to provide a forum of discussion on the issues of this interaction between science and\nsociety. We do this by meeting at lunchtime on Tuesdays\nin Southside Upper lounge for\na drink (everyone welcome)\nand inviting speakers of varied renown to talk or lead a discuss sion. To see what we' ve been up to this year, we started with Dr.Jerry Rave tz, historian and philosopher of\nscience, who maintained that\nscience was not neutral and\nattempted to destroy the ideology of 'pure science'. This term we invited Sir\nBrian Flowers who talked on\nscience education and research from the perspective of IC.He discussed the theme of\naccountability of a scientist as an individual, to his em-ploy er, to the public good,\nbut refused to be drawn on the\nvalidity of the various inter-est s, and whether we had satisfactory mechanisms of ensuring accountability - essentially a political process. He said that means are techno-logical but that ends are poli t ical; thus scientists ought\nto be conversant in the social sciences, so they can contribute to the debate over both\nmeans and ends. He hopes\ncourses in \" relevant\" social sciences will be introduced\nat IC. However, he is adamant that IC should not turn in to another LSE.. I hope, per-son ally, that he does not suppress necessary political discussion. Last week, David Dickson, science journalist and author\nof \" Alternative Technology\", presented his thesis that the\ndemarcation between technology and politics cannot be\nmaintained, i.e. the decision to develop a technology, the\ntechnology itself, and the\nuses to which it is put, along\nwith the side effects, are inextricably linked thro gh the\nstructure of a given society.\nAs for the rest of this term,\nwe hope to have Brain E as lea, author of \"Liberation\nand the Aims of Science\",\nand Professor Bernard Fe ld from MIT, active in \"Pug-wash\", and reputed to have\nbeen on Nixon' s list of \" enemies\", who will discuss the\nrole of Non-super Powers who\nnevertheless have nuclear\n\" capability\" e.g. Britain, France, Israel, India etc. Look out for further det ails or contact Pete Glass Physics3.

    "content": "8 FELIX FRENCH TRIP 75\nThe task seems to have fallen to me to write this account, as everyone else who went on the trip seems to be suffering from\nwriter's cramp at the moment, or perhaps they have all strained\ntheir right arms lifting up all those bottles of wine!\nThe coach left IC Union\nArch on Friday, 14th February,\nat 9.30 am and we headed for\nDover with a most competent\ndriver from Glasgow called\nJock at the we heel who had\nnever been to Paris before in\nhis life.\nOur first stop was at Canterbury where a majority dec i ded they wanted to go to the\nloo, only to find that the gents\nwas locked, so nature being\nwhat it is, a large mixed queue\nformed outside the ladies. Did we get some funny looks! We\narrived at Dover and the boat\nleft for Boulogne at2 pm. It\nwas a French ship and the\nsnack bar had a wide range of\nsandwiches - ham, ha or ham?\nAt 3.30pm we reached Boulogne and then set off for Paris. Just before Beauvais( most of\nus were feeling somewhat hungry after those delicious ham\nsandwiches) we decided to\nstop at a roadside cafe/bar.\nWe all entered the cafe creating absolute havoc . Since only\n12 were from IF, guess who\nhad to do all the ordering...\nThe Frenchie behind the bar\nnearly fainted when I asked\nfor 27 plates of chips! Was he\nrelieved to see the back of us! We reached Paris at 11pm. On Saturday morning we were taken by the French students to their college to be\nwelcomed by Monsieur Strauss.\nThen we went off on a coach tour of Paris with some of the\npare the two, Mooney's is a non-starter.\nThe evening was free and a group of us went to Montparna sse, and on emerging from the\nmetro were promptly soaked in\nthe sudden down pour before\nbeing able to find a cafe. We dived into the first cafe that\nwould hold all12 of us (it\nturned out to be the dearest)\nand once again created havoc .\nHowever, we got our money's worth in the end, because\nsomeone decided to pinch the\nDebbie Parker French'students acting as guides. At about 1 o 'clock we\nreturned to the college for a celebration lunch. This consisted of a fantastic spread of\nfood, flaming pancakes, and of\ncourse, barrels of wine. Feeling considerably full\nand somewhat affected by the\nwine, we were free to occupy\nourselves as we pleased for\nthe afternoon. Supper was taken at F.I.A. P. and I have\nbeen assured that if you corn-menu. The Latin Quarter was our next target where we found\na nice Greek Tavern.\nSunday we had lunch at the\nCite Universitaire, and then\nset off for Versailles for the\nafternoon. Supper was at F.I.A. P. and in the eve ing the\nFrench had booked us front\nseats at a Folklore Dance/ Show. At first, we were a bit\nsceptical thinking it was a ballet, however we were surprised when we found it was not, and enjoyed it immensely,\nespecially when J. P.D. had to\npresent a bouquet of flowers to\na lady in the orchestra. Next\non the agenda was a tour of\nPigalle where the f river was all for stopping off!\nMonday morning we were\nsupposed to be at the college\nat 9am, but needless to say, we were late. First we had a welcome speech by the Director, then a speech by M. Strauss.\nWe had to leave Paris at 1\no 'clock and made for Boulogne,\nstopping off at a village on the\nway to rid them of their stocks\nof wine . There was a Force 8\ngale on the Channel, and after\nso much wine, a few looked\npretty green. But we reached\nIC in one piece at about 9 3 0\npm.\nI think we would all agree\nthat the French students were\nvery generous and patient with\nus, and did all they could to\ngive us a good time, especially the students of the Ecole Nati on al Superieure de Chimie\nde Paris. So now it just remains for me to say a special thankyou to all those who\ncame and made it such an enjoyable trip, because without\nyou it would not have been\npossible.\nget ready for s pom mm!!!

    "content": "FELIX DAVY' S ESGflPflDES\nAT LAST \"Davy\" is back home in Mines ! His53 day adventure into the outside world ended last Friday when he was returned\nto his custodians and once again took up residence in the RSM\nbuilding. During the months that\nfollowed the disappearance of\n\"Davy\", relations became\nstrained as successive communications from the Doctor and\nthe Guilds Union consist ant ly contradicted earlier communiques . Of one thing there was\nlittle doubt: The 'Doctor' and\nhis organisation were a force\nto be reckoned with and afforded every respect.\nThe waiting game is apt to\nbore men of action so, while\nthe RSM Union played out the\nofficial wrangling, its members\nset to work with a variety of\nplots. Most came to nothing\nbut one, the bugging of the\nC& CU office, bore fruit and\nfuel for the RSM \"peep soc\".\nNames could not always be\nlinked with voices, consequently we are still wondering who\nit was, on the eve of the\nGuilds' Dinner& Dance, who\nwarned Jenny Jones, \"You'll\nhave to keep your legs together\ntomorrow night, Jenny\"!\nAmusement was never ending. I hardly believed my ears, as\nI was taking my turn on watch,\nto find myself in the middle of\na Guilds' Committee meeting,\nhearing for the first time\nacknowledgements from Mr\nBarnes of the superiority of\nMines. Clearly the RSM 'Brain\nCell' cannot be so bad after\nall, for openly and unashamedly the VP of Guilds was\npoaching on our Initiatives,\ngiving fact to the feeling that\nJohn Mortimer what Mines does today, Guilds will do tomorrow. Need any\nhelp with your apathy problem\nDave?? By comparison, GuiIds\nillegal attempt at radio transmissions from the RSMU office\nwas brief and unsuccessful. The Guilds' offer to sell Davy to the Camborne School\nof Mines was made on January\n28th, before any conditions\nwere offered to us, and a copy\nof the letter was received by\nme on Thursday, 30th. From\nElection Manifestoes\nDEPUTY PRESIDENT R.I. Z. S.Sh a kir( prop, by N.J. Payne) I have been at IC for two years and though I did not take active part\nin the Union in my first year! remained interested enough to know what\nwent on and how the Union works. I did however take as full a part as\n1 could in hall (weeks) life and helped m the running and organising of\nsocial events. I have also done this in Garden Hall but due to commit tm ents to FELIX these activities have been limited.\nMy duties as Features Editor took me to College Block (especially\nin connection with producing the careers supplement) and as a result,)\nnow know how the administration is run and who runs it. In the course\nof this it has become crystal clear to me that a gulf exists between the\nstudents and College Block. This gap must be bridged and one way of\nso doing will be for me to arrange talks (by the CB officials) and question and answer sessions where students could meet these people and\nexpress their views.\nThe DP( thro' the House Committee) is responsible for the Union\nfacilities. In addition to upholstering of the furniture and the possibility of fitting a cord carpet in the lounge bar (which is already being\nlooked at), I intend to make the refectories much more a e the tic ally appealing and also to ensure a high standard of cleanliness and hy-gie ne.I would also like to see some repairs carried out in the gymnasium. If I am DP next year I shall be available ALL of the time. This will\nhelp me to represent your views more accurately thus making it possible for the union to do what YOU WANT IT TO, FOR YOUR BENEFIT. I think I have the ability to negotiate which will help me when I am\nrepresenting you on the various committees. Finally I will ask you to\nvote for me AND please VOTE. M,F. Kessler( prop, by R. Argent! As I see it, the job of Deputy President is split into three main parts\n1, Maintaining the Union Areas 2. Representing the Union on various College committees and 3. Some general Union Administration\ni.e. Union Meetings, committees, including Council. I feel that during\nmy time at College, I have gained sufficient experience to enable me to\ncope with all aspects of the D.P.'s job. As aCC UV P,I have learnt\nabout Union Meetings the hard way, from the front, I have sat on many\ncommittees and learnt how to handle the prolonged wrangling that most\ncommittees call discuss sion. I have been to many Council meetings\nand, also, have made myself known all over College. This w. il be useful as DP for although the Deputy President's job is not primarily soc-i al, it is important for him to be widely known. This is particularly so\nin connection with running the Union Building because if anything needs\nrepair it is much easier to find someone you know than just aDP. Over the last few years, the function of many rooms in the Union\nBuilding has changed and most of the furniture has been replaced or\nrenovated and so, next year, the emphasis must change from renewing\nto re decoration and furnishing each room to suit its purpose, eg the TV room could do with dimmer lighting. \" Mike\" has been back at College\nfor about a year and I would like it put on permanent display - if ade-gu ate security can be arranged - so, if elected I would do all I can to\nbuild a secure plinth so everyone can 3ee our mascot.\nI seem to have to the end of my 300 words, so to sum up, I want to\nvote for me because I have (I think) the knowledge and experience to do\nthe DP's job successfully.\nUnion Resources Working Party\nICU Council set up a working party with the following terms of\nreference:\n\"To examine the workings of the Felix Office and the Union Cenral Administration and to report on the options open to the Union\nin the deployment of its resources in and between these areas\".\nThe comments of Union Members are urgently sought. Please send them to the Honorary Secretary, Union Resource Working\nParty, c/o Union Office.\nthe depths of the RSM building\nthe seed of the idea sprang\ninto life and the printing presses clattered into action. We\nknew by then that Camborne\nhad received the offer and were\nshortly to submit a bid. By\nsubmitting an earlier reply,\nthere was a chance that we may\nhave succeeded in posing as\nCamborne.\nAs the headed notepaper\nspun off the press, the problem\nof beating the Camborne reply\npressed even harder on our\nminds. Still, we did it. Typed,\nsigned, sealed, postmarked and\ndelivered, all on Friday morn-ing! The rest was reported in\nFELIX. Alas, the letter was\nnot opened until Monday at the\nsame time as the real reply.\nBy then our bug had been d is covered and so we were in the\ndark. The rest was my own\nfault! We decided that to play\nit through could do no harm.\nUnfortunately the idea of such\na good replica had not occurred\nto me !\nThe RSMU Committee decided that the time had come to\nsubmit. The Doctor's organisation had won our respect.\nThe Guilds' conditions were\ndelivered to us and they were\nagreed in substance on 13th February though later they\nwere to find that their words\nhad been rather loose.\nFirst we were told one thing and then another, but\nfinally the date for the Davy\nhandover was fixed. 1.00 p.m. Beit quad, February 28th. A large crowd of spectators had\nassembled in the quad, whilst in the bar last minute checks\nwere in progress to make sure\nthat the Davy bearers had the\nre quis it swimming trunks and\nGuilds s lopp shirts. Panic struck a s1o' clock drew nearer on the realisation that one\nof the bearers was still without\na shirt. Many apologies to\nRich Gundersen for waylaying\nhim in the quad and swiping\nhis shirt! The RSMU contingent ent ered nonchalantly from Beit\narchway only to stand waiting\nwhile Dru tried to make his beer damped fireworks go bang\nHe finally succeeded in ign i ting a dry b anger and as if by\nmagic, Jenny Jones material -Ised through the billowing\nsmoke to enquire of the RSMU\nbearers why they were not\nwearing Guilds' s lopp shirts\nand swimming trunks. She had\nunfortunately forgotten to tell\nus they had to showing !!\nTo an earsplitting shout by\nMines, Davy appeared from\nBe it Hall newly painted In\nblue and red. Quickly it was\nchecked and then escorted\nwithout further delay to the\nnew home In Mines, while Guilds performed a boom a lake r. The anticlimax was complete !\nIn the final analysis, Mines\nlost the battle but won the war.\nWe lost little more than a mas-cot. True enough, Guilds took\n\u00a3150 of our Rag money, but to\nthe sixty people who collected\n\u00a3720 to get Davy back, it was\na drop In the ocean. Our pride\nwas only slightly dented, our\nheads were never bowed In\nshame. But what did Gui Ids\nlose? They lost the chance to\nmake us do these things and\none chance was all they had.\nOne chance is all the RSM\nwill give anyone!\nMini Mystery ON SATURDAY afternoon a mini was seen to be parked on the grass in the Be it quad\nminding its own business. No\none seemed to know who it\nbelonged to why it was there\nbut no one seemed to be un-due ly concerned .\nHowever, later that day at\nabout 11.30 pm the mini was\nstanding in the union door with\nits rear bumper against the\ninner swing doors, as if trying\nto get into the building .\nApparently, about 60 people\nmaking their way home from\nthe bar put the mini in this\nsomewhat unusual place and\nquite ly slipped away. Subsequently it was extracted and\nremoved to Prince Consort\nRoad by Dram soc. members,\nwho had been working late. V, mm \u00a7*iI IMH "
