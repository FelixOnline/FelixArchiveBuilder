    "content": "felix talk\nHIV and AIDS affects us all.\nWhen AIDS first emerged as\na disease over twenty years\nago, few people could have\npredicted how the epidemic\nwould evolve, and fewer still\ncould have described with any\ncertainty the best ways of\ncombating it. Now in the year\n2002, it is known from experience that AIDS can devastate\nwhole regions, knock decades\noff national development,\nwiden the gulf between rich\nand poor nations and push\nalready-stigma tis ed groups\ncloser to the margins of so cie ty.\nAlready, 21.8 million people\naround the world have died of\nAIDS, 4.3 million of them children by the end of 2000.\nNearly twice that many - 40\nmillion - are now living with\nHIV, the virus that causes\nAIDS, and most of these are\nChaplaincy\nlikely to die over the next\ndecade or so. The most recent\nUNAIDS/WHO estimates\nshow that, in 2001 alone, 5 million people were newly infected with HIV\nMichael Sean Paterson in his\nbook 'Singing for our lives'\nwrites:\n\"Tell me it's not true ...\n\u2022 That AIDS provokes feelings of fear, ignorance, dis-gust, hostility, rejection, mar-gina lisa tion and prejudice\n\u2022 That AIDS strikes at the\nvulnerable - the African peoples, gay men, intravenous\ndrug users, commercial sex\nworkers, haemophilia cs \u2022 That those who live with\nAIDS personally embody the\nrejection of society hungry for\na scapegoat\n\u2022 That people with AIDS\ncarry the can for all that society cannot face to.\"\nSadly we cannot say that it\nis not true, because we know\nfull well that it is true!\nSebi died last year from\nAIDS. He was 9 years old. Sebi\nwas born in Romania and\ninfected when he received a blood tonic' soon after his\nbirth. His parents could not\ncope so they placed him in an\norphanage.\nJohnathon also died last\nyear. He was 45 and one of the\nfirst to be diagnosed with the\nvirus in this country.\nSadly some in the Church\nstill condemn those who have\nthe HIV or AIDS virus. They\ncondemn people for the lifestyle that they live. But for\nmany Christian people this is\nnot the response that we\nwould give. So what should\nour response be? Paterson\ngives some responses from\npeople with the virus:\n\u2022 We are living with Aids,\nnot dying of Aids\n\u2022 Don't judge, but accept us\n\u2022 Don't classify us into two\ngroups - the 'poor innocents'\nand those who brought HIV on\nthemselves.\n\u2022 Don't be frightened of us.\nWe won't infect you.\n\u2022 Don't love me for Christ's sake. Love me for my sake.\n\u2022 We are looking for God too,\nbut not necessarily in the\nplaces where the Church has\nhidden him.\nThere are people and organisations both on and off campus who are happy to discuss\nany issues that may arise from\nthis article. If you would like to\ntalk in total confidence, the\nChaplaincy team are available\nand can also advise on other\npeople that you might like to\ncontact, chaplaincy@ic.ac.uk\nor 020 7594 9600.\nInkwell - Condom Bureaucracy\nIn case you've been having a more than active sex-life late-ly, it might interest you to\nknow - if you don't already -that free condoms are available from the IC Health Centre\nin South-side. But, if you're\nthinking of walking in, and\nhelping yourself to a generous\nquantity...think again. For\nthere's a small catch.\nAnd here it is: You have to\nfill out a special form. Yes!\nSomething aptly named, a \"Condom Ordering Form\". A little piece of paper presumably\nupon which you fill in all your\ndetails; you know...Name,\nAge, Sex, quantity required,\netc. After which you kindly\nhand in your filled form to the\nnice lady at the counter. I presume she'd check for any silly\nerrors you might have made.\n\"Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Bloggs\"\nshe might say, \"But could you\nplease be more specific? Is\nthat extra strong or regular?\nWould you like it with or without spermicide?\" and so on\nand so forth. After which you\nturn pink, smile sheepishly\nand say... \"Busy weekend.\"\nNow, of course since making\nthis startling discovery a few\nweeks ago, the question-O meter in my head has risen to\ncritical point and one or two\nquestions have been flitting\nwithin the inner walls of my\ncranium.\nFirst Question.. .Why?\nHas Imperial College really\nsunk to such bureaucratic\nlows? One would have expected to see the little rectangular\npackages lying lazily in a disorderly pile in a small yet\naccessible basket, such that\nfingers could conveniently\nswipe a few. Why forms need\nto be laboriously filled is completely beyond me.\nIf this is the Health Centre's idea of encouraging safe\nsex...viz. asking you to publicly fill out a \"Condom\nOrdering Form\", no wonder\nBritain has such a high\n\"unwanted-pregnancy\" rate.\nOne understands the importance of keeping records et al,\nbut surely there must be limits\nto bureaucracy, and this, in my\nhumble opinion is simply\npushing them far. Too far!\nThe second obvious question is.. .Who?\nWho on earth would be so\nbrazen as to venture counter-ward, with \"Condom Ordering\nForm\" in hand?\nIt brings to mind that rather\nmemorable scene from Ally\nMcBeal, where she ventures\nbravely to the counter to pay\nfor some spermicide. Sadly for\nMs. McBeal, the till stops\nworking, and the insensitive\ncashier chooses to announce\npublicly over the PA system\nfor the price of spermicide. (At\nwhich Ms. McBeal naturally\nturns bright pink and cringes.)\nI accept that ours is an age\nin which there exists a sense\nof sexual freedom and open-ness, but Puh-lee ze! Asking\npeople to fill out a form to\nobtain condoms is not only\npotentially embarrassing; it's downright ridiculous as well.\n\n"

    "content": "council comment\nCouncil Comment\nThis letter was received from\nTasha Newton on Wednesday\nevening, and due to print\ndeadlines, was too late to go in\nthe letters page. However,\nsince it is very relevant to this\nweek's issues, I have included\nit here. Alongside it is my edi-to rial, to balance the tone of\nthis page.\n'Watch out Sen we're going to\nsack you'\nSometimes Union meetings\ncan be stuffed full of jargon that\nmakes regular students feel out-side rs. But last night, when a council member officially\nwarned the President of ICU\nthat he was facing a motion of\ncensure, anyone could have\nunderstood that Sen's job is\nvery much on the line.\nAs a final year who hopes to\nleave IC in June, you would\nhave thought that I would have\nsimply sat back and laughed at\nlast night's farce of a meeting.\nBut sadly as a misguided former\nSabbatical, I care about what\nhappens to ICU, its staff and\nstudents. I am especially worried that only the Sabbs' view\non what happened will appear\nin Felix, so here's an alternative\ninterpretation of what went on.\nCouncil was first asked to\nconsider a motion on whether\nICU should have a referendum\non joining the NUS. I'm sure that\nthat news will be covered in\ngreat detail in Felix. There were\ntwo sides to the debate, those\nwho felt it's time you, the students decide rather than\nCouncil deciding on your behalf\nand those who felt that a referendum would dominate the\nforthcoming elections and exam\nperiod, be a waste of money\nand probably fall flat due to lack\nof votes. (It needs more than 1.5\ntimes the number of people\nwho normally turn out for elections!) In the end even Council\nwasn't that convinced, only just\nover half thought it was a good\nidea and the meeting was\nin quo rate anyway. (Sorry, in\nother words not even half of\nCouncil was there, which\nmeans only a quarter of Council\nthought it was good.) The real\nquestion is, why would Sen\nwant to do this to us? Could it\nbe that he worries that he'll be\nfinishing soon and won't have\ndone anything, that we won't remember him? Or is he looking\nfor an advantage in the up-com-ing election?\nAfter this really bad decision\nthere was an amusing turn of\nevents as the President came\nunder fire for going to Felix with\nissues before Council, for giving\nup his duty as returning officer\n(ah, yes, you see he does want\nto stand again, heavens!) and\nlots of other things I can't even\nremember. Then he was told\nthat he should realise that people are considering sacking\nhim. They weren't joking, seri-ou sly, people were asking me\nafter the meeting if I'd sign up.\nWell Sen, I think they're going to\nremember you now, mate! Just\nwhen the whole thing couldn't get any more bizarre one of the\nmembers challenged the number of people at the meeting,\nquorum, there weren't enough\npeople so that was it, game\nover!\nNow I can't really comment\non whether Sen should get the\nsack or not (although I can tell\nyou that people normally have\nto be really, really bad for it even\nto be suggested) because I 've\nbeen out the country for three\nmonths and simply don't know.\nBut I can tell you that an NUS\nreferendum is a bleak thing.\nThere's gonna be a big fight,\nand it'll probably be for nothing.\nWhat you need to ask yourselves is: What are Sen's motives for bringing about this\nreferendum? Is he worried that\nwith just two Councils to go he\nwon't have done anything? Or is\nit because he hopes he'll have\nan (unfair) advantage over the\nIssue 1227\n8 February 2002\nEditor: will Dugdale\nDeputy Editor: Ali Wren\nNews: Vacant\nMusic: Dave Edwards\nBooks: Jon Matthews\nArts: Jon Brenner\nFilm: Darius Nikbin\nSports: Vacant\nCrossword: Dr. Hot Fudge\nWith Thanks To:\nJohn S Felix, Beit Quad, Prince\nConsort Road, London,\nSW7 2BB Tel: 020 7594 8072\nEmail: felix@ic.ac.uk\nPrinted by: MCP Litho Limited\nFelix is a registered\nnewspaper: ISSN 1040 - 0711\nCopyright \u00a9 Felix 2002\nother candidates because he\ncan say he knows more about it\nthan them? He told Council last\nnight he doesn't care either\nway, that he's going to be totally impartial. But ask yourselves,\nhow can he be, when he wants\nto be the President who will\nhave to deal with whatever the\ndecision is? Thanks, Tasha\nNewton, (n. newton@ic.ac.uk)\nAnd now... my reply:\nWhile Tasha's concerns\nshould be considered, her own\nmotives for writing this letter\nshould be questioned. She is a very vocal opponent to affiliation with the NUS, and was\nseen in council to argue against\naffiliation very emotionally.\nShe seems to be under the\nimpression that Felix is written\nby the Union, and this is possibly because the relationship\nbetween Felix and the Union\nthis year is significantly better\nthan that of her tenure as Union\nPresident. This does not, how-ever, mean that Felix is a vehicle for Union propaganda, but,\nin my opinion, this does help to\nensure that many of the news\nstories are more accurate than\nthey have been in the past,\nsince the Sabbatical officers are\nmore willing to talk to, and give\nquotes to Felix.\nInterestingly, the Council in\nquestion was quo rate( did have\nthe rm ni mum number of people\npresent), and was only\ndeclared otherwise as a mistake by Council Chair Sam\nSharpe. Additionally, Mr Sharpe\nhas now resigned from this\npost for academic reasons,\nwhich means for the time\nbeing, Sen Ganesh is Council\nChair. Conspiracy, perhaps?\nTasha also seems to think\nthat Sen having more knowledge than other candidates is\nan 'unfair advantage' when it\ncomes to elections. Sorry?\nSurely if someone has more\nknowledge, they're a better\ncandidate: that's what two\nyear sabbaticals are for. So you\ndon't have to teach them everything again. And Sen clearly\ndoesn't control Council, so his\nimpartiality is not an issue.\nFinally, Sen was warned with\ncensure, meaning someone\nwas warning that they were\nconsidering the first step to\ngetting a bit cross with him.\nThis was because he had,\napparently, told Felix about the\nfifth sabbatical before Council.\nWhich he hadn't. Felix discovered that from an independent\nsource, and merely asked Sen\nfor a quote. So it seems to me\nthat Tasha has used this particularly bizarre Council session\nas an excuse to cast a bad light\non a decision that was democratically made. Hmm. will\n\n"

This single is quality rock music that\nsounds slightly punk y and energetic. Unfortunately, the B sides\nare not up to scratch - they're quite thrash y, more like other run\nof the mill rock. But on the basis of the first track, I look forward\nto hearing the album.\nTobyB\nBEN& JASON How The Hell Do I Explain?\nThis is the second single from the beautiful album Ten Songs\nAbout You. Apparently written in the period of relief the pair felt\nafter believing they had finished the album, How The Hell Do I Explain? is full of laid-back strings and tambourine shakes.\nThese, together with Ben's smooth, melancholy vocals, make\nthis track the perfect chill-out tune.\nJess\nSPEK - Smell the Coffee\nA fun little pop song where Spek puts on the coolest voice he\ncan and raps over adit zy guitar riff, while female vocalists\nchime along obediently in the background.

Nothing here to get\nannoyed about, but nothing to get interested in either.\nTom X TIMO MAAS To Get Down German DJ Timo Maas makes a good fist of imitating the\nChemical Brothers/Prodigy style of combining guitars and funky\nhouse breaks, but it doesn't quite come off.

Thankfully, it goes nowhere\nnear that, and is instead a fine bluesy number reminiscent of\nthe Black Crowes at their peak. The song does get a bit repetitive after a while, but it's a good one to bring out now and then\nfor a bit of cheering up.\nTank\nSAHARA HOTNIGHTS - On Top Of Your World\nSahara Hotnights are an angry ball of frustration, all shouts\nand hollers over jumpy rhythms and staccato guitar salvos.\nStrong vocals burn through the slick production, only to offer up\nboring teen clich es.

It's chilled-out jazz house, courtesy of the man who revolutionised\nFrench house music in the mid '90s, and it features the stunning\nvoice of Nicole Graham. The two B side tracks are both good\nremixes - the first is an Indigo Blues remix by Minus 8, and the\nsecond is a remix of I Cry (from the album Newcomer) by Ernst\nSt Laurent.

    "content": "pico con preview\nics f:25 Years and Counting\nThe IC union science fiction, fantasy and horror society is celebrating its 25th year during this academic year. The big red\nbook of society accounts indicates that the society started in\n1976 and had such exciting events as showings in the IC cinema of Barbarella and Invasion of the body Snatchers. 25 years\nlater and we are still showing equally cheesy films, although we\nnow show them in our own dedicated library.\nIn 1976 the Beit hall warden generously donated a couple of\nhundred science fiction and fantasy books. These Were stored in\n3 large lockers in the Green CommitteeRoom on the top floor of\nthe union. In 1987 the society was given its own room, a pleasant cupboard under the south west corner of Beit Quad. It contained a growing collection of books and healthy colonies of\ncockroaches and silverfish. The card system was getting rather\ndifficult to manage, so in 1995 a member donated a pc to run a database and this sturdy little 386 ran the system until 1999. In\n1996 the library obtained a television and video player and\nthere were regular crowds of people squashed in the cramped\nspace between pipes watching the increasing number of society videos.\nAfter a hard fought campaign the society obtained a new\nroom, located almost directly underneath Beit Quad arch. After\nseveral weeks of cleaning, painting, decorating and moving\nover 3000 books down the corridor, ics f became established in\nits new library (a room which is now the Beit Hall laundry). The .\nlibrary was huge and was quickly furnished with things\nacquired from various skips around college. However with the\nstart of the Beit renovations we were once again on the move to\na location dubbed by the sabbaticals at the time as \"the ics f por-ta cabin experience\". In October 1999 the society reluctantly\nmoved venue from its luxurious underground cavern to an upper\nporta cabin behind the main library which was about half the\nsize of our previous one. It was generally pretty crowded in\nthere, although at least when there were lots of people in there,\nit wasn't quite so cold!\nThe delays of the Beit project meant that we were in the por-ta cabin for twice as long as originally planned, but the wait was\nwell worth it. Last year we moved into our beautiful new home\nin the Union West Basement Media Centre. We could finally\nspread out all the library contents. At the moment the library\ncontains 4460 books, 113 graphic novels, 447 videos, and 36\naudio items. All of these items can be borrowed by society\nmembers and we show a video every lunchtime for members to\nsit, watch, debate and make jokes about.\nPicocon 19 - February 9th Our major event almost every year since 1984 has been our\none day convention - Picocon. The first Picocon came to be\nwhen a group of society members invited a few friends, including a couple of authors to the union bar for a day of discussion\nand drinking. The event was called Picocon as a rival university held two day conventions called Microcon, so as ours was\neven smaller we decided on Picocon. We now also hold fem to cons for Freshers that only last an afternoon - see, our sense of\nhumour is still as good as ever.\nOver the years Picocons have grown, they now take over the\nentire union building and attract more than 100 guests. Over the\nyears we've had such renowned authors as Stephen Baxter,\nTerry Pratchett and Iain (M) Banks. Other events include\ndebates, quizzes, panels and film showings in the icu cinema.\nThis year is no exception: Picocon 19 will be coming to the\nUnion building from 10am on Saturday February 9th and we will\nbe joined by four special guests:\nAnne Gay - author of several fantasy books including\nMindsail and Dancing on the Volcano and also edits LineOne's Science Fiction and Fantasy Club.\nChina Mieville - The winner of this year's Arthur C. Clarke\naward for his novel Perdido Street Station and has also written\nKing Rat and The Scar.\nStan Nicholls - has done a wide range of jobs in the genre,\nincluding managing a SF&F book and memorabilia shop, jour-nal is m, teaching and writing fiction and biographies.\nGeoff Ryman is a past winner of the Clarke and many other\nawards for his novels. He has also created an internet book - 253\n<www.ryman-novel.com>, about the people on a tube journey.\nOther events of the day will include our famous (or is that\ninfamous?) destruction of dod gy merchandise during which we\nauction tacky items to be destroyed in entertaining ways by the\nhighest bidder (all money to RAG). There will also be book-sellers, aLAN network, Dalek racing and even a Killer tournament running throughout the day. To round it all off there will be\na showing of Pitch Black in the icu cinema which everyone can\ncome along to. The day kicks off with registration at 10am and\nfinishes with the film at 6pm. All of this will only cost you \u00a35 if\nyou're a current student, \u00a32 if you're already and member of ics f, or \u00a38 if you are neither. Oh, and there will be a piece of birthday cake for every attend ee. What more could anyone want\nfrom a sci-fi convention?\nThere is more information on ics f, its history and details of\nPicocon on our WebPages - www.su.ic.ac.uk/ics f. Or drop by the\nlibrary one lunchtime to have a chat... we're not that scary... not\nreally.\nLorna\n\n"

    "content": "interview film\nWas there a particular moment when you felt you had\nbecome Ali? When you felt you had made it?\nYou know there were moments that information created an\nepiphany. I don't specifically remember a moment where I said\n'I got it, I'm Ali'. I don't remember that moment. It was such a gradual process for me. I remember Michael called in a guy\ncalled Jeronimo, formerly Jeronimo Pratt, of the Black Panthers.\nMichael had called him in to give me a sense of the era, because\nthat was what was really difficult for me. The comprehension of\nthe sixties is so foreign to me. I'm a child of rap music, cars, and\nwomen so I just cannot relate to the social upheaval of the sixties and Jeronimo said that war had been declared on Black\nAmerica. Fire hoses, dogs, domestic terrorism, the bombing of\nthe church in Birmingham, Alabama. He said war had been\ndeclared and when he said that, I just felt a wave of under-standing. Of course, Muhammad Ali had not gone to Vietnam to\nfight a war, when in his mind, he's fighting a war right here at\nhome, and if he goes ten thousand miles away, women and children aren't safe here in America. One war at a time. And with\nthat point of view, I started to feel the dominoes beginning to\ntumble towards becoming Muhammad Ali and understanding\nthe necessity for that point of view. The necessity for this hero\nduring that era.\nThere was a negative sense out there that the Fresh Prince of\nBel Air was playing the king of the boxing world. Seeing that\nit would take two year's of your life to become this man, did.\nit take you a long time to make that choice?\nWell, I turned the script down for years. Probably for six years.\nI think I was probably twenty-seven the first time an Ali script\nwas presented to me. I just turned it down for years and years.\nEven I couldn't see the road from Will Smith, Fresh Prince of Bel\nAir, to Muhammad Ali. Someone said 'you have to become\nMuhammad Ali'. What do you do to become Muhammad Ali?\nMichael Mann was the first person who illustrated what he\ncalled a 'course syllabus' for becoming Muhammad Ali. He said,\n'I will create the curriculum that will create Muhammad Ali inside of you'. I was like 'alright, cool!' I didn't know what it was!\nHe said that there would be essentially a three-tiered course\nsyllabus. The first tier would be physical. He said we are going\nto run the way Muhammad Ali ran in the cities on the routes\nthat he ran. We are going to eat the food that Muhammad Ali ate. We are going to spar the way he sparred. We are going to\ngo get Angelo Dundee and train the way Muhammad Ali trained. And by we, he meant me! He said that creating the\nphysical life and the physical burden of Muhammad Ali would\ntake us to the second tier, the mental and emotional development of Muhammad Ali. And he said by understanding what it\nfeels like to be in a ring, and when that bell rings, and knowing\nthat there's an animal on the other side of that ring that wants\nnothing more than to tear your head off, by being in that physical space you will understand the mental and emotional stress\nthat Muhammad Ali lived with on a daily basis.\nThis would naturally carry us to the third tier which would be\nthe spiritual development. From understanding the physical,\nmental, and emotional, he said that I would understand the\nnecessity for the spiritual convictions that Muhammad Ali had\ndeveloped during the period that we were shooting in the film.\nWhat about Ali's vocal mannerisms?\nWe worked with a dialect coach. It was the same 'course syl-la bus' that Michael Mann laid out just after the physical. We\nfound that Ali had a big, wide open chest and that's what gave\nhim a big resonant voice, but he also really constricted his\nthroat which gave him almost a higher pitched sound. Then we\ntraced essentially the flavour of his dialect to seven Baptist\npreachers. So we studied a few Baptist preachers. You know\nhow he'll get really low and speak really low and getting really\ndramatic, and then he takes it up high. So the voice is really that\nvery holy Baptist preacher trying to impart the holy ghost.\nWhat is your view about boxing as a sport?\nI think in America, with boxing in the early 20s,30 s and 40s, the\nboxing ring was the only place where is was fair. For Jack\nJohnson, for Joe Louis, for Muhammad Ali, the boxing ring represented the only place that racism didn't matter. Because when\nJohnson hits you with that right hand, no matter how racist you\nare, you're asleep! So it represented a place where it was man\nto man, it was one on one, and there was no perceivable way to\ncheat. So I think that's a large part of the reason why people\ntend to gravitate towards the boxing match as a true test of\nman to man. There is no room for the referee to fly a flag; you\ncan't get a red card! There's none of that, it's one to one, man on\nman. Or woman to woman! Absolutely!\nDid any of Ali's mannerisms stay with you after the shoot?\nYes, the pure appreciation of beautiful women. That has stayed\nwith me. The mementos also, I kept everything. All of the\nclothes, all of the gloves, everything. I knew from day one that\nthis would be a journey that I would remember for the rest of my\nlife. When we got into Africa, we had the opportunity to sit with\nNelson Mandela and at every turn in making this film I just had\nnew experiences and was being enlightened. I was keeping\neverything that I could get my hands on.\nWhat chance has Mike Tyson got against Lennox Lewis?\nThat's a tough one. That's real tough. If Mike trains, he's hard to\nbeat.

    "content": "reviews arts\nParis:Capital of the Arts 1900-68\nRoyal Academy of Arts\nFor most of the 20th century Paris' beauty, roman tr c spirit, liberality (and low cost living too!) have made it the world's capital of\narts, attracting artists form all over the world: Picasso and Dali\nfrom Spain, Chagall and Kandinsky from Russia, Modrgliani from\nItaly, Foujita from Japan and Kelly from the USA are a representative sample.\nFrom the World Fair of 1900 to the student street riots in 1968 .\nthe exhibition guides the spectator through the masterpieces of\nthe artists, and at the same time it highlights the social and political context in which they were developed. Four main sections\ncorrespond to the four districts of Paris that constituted the centre of intellectual activities: Montmartre with its rural character,\nits cabarets and nightclubs from 1900-18; Montparnasse with a sophisticated taste for cafes, Jazz and an international artistic\nelite from 1919-39; Saint-Germain-des-Pres as a shelter during\nthe Nazi occupation and later as the cradle of existentialism\n(1940-57); finally The Latin Quarter with the politic turbulence of\nthe European 60s, culminating with the 1968 student rebellions.\nIt's hard to choose the most representative works out of a set of\nalmost 300, all of the highest quality. Worth mentioning are surely the studies for \"Les Damoiselles d 'Avignon\" by Picasso, opening the way to Cubism, and the nudes of the Ecole de Paris for the\nfirst section. Avant-garde, Dadaism and Surrealism constitute the\nMontparnasse section, where Mondrian, Duchamp and Dali are\nthe flag bearers. During and after the German occupation is evident a radical shift in the themes and techniques employed, and\nthe visual arts undergo the transformation through the metamorphosis of the sixties, to the contemporary way of interpreting art\nand the artist. Finally the 60s, characterised by political engagement and torn between philo-american Nouveau Realisme and\nthe left wing sym pathi sing Narrative Figuration movement.\nTo our opinion the value of the exhibition lies, apart from the\nimpressive collection of art, also in a coherent exposition that\nallows to travel through time and follow the evolution of arts in\ntheir own very centre, that constitutes in acer tarn way the ultimate masterpiece: Paris is the real focus, the \"prima-Donna\".\nKlee:The Nature of Creation\nHayward Gallery\nWrth a grandiose title like \"The Nature of Creation\" our expectations of this exhibition were high, and if the queue was anything\nto go by we weren't the only excited ones. The Hayward Gallery\nhas become a temporary home to about one hundred of Paul\nKlee's works created between 1914 and 1940. The exhibition has\nmet with mixed reviews so feeling all important with our press\ntickets in hand we stepped out of the drizzle and waved goodbye to the soggy queue to give our, ahem, definitive verdict.\nPaul Klee is often heralded as one of the great painters of the\nlast century and a fore-father of abstraction. The exhibition was\njoint-curate d by Bridget Riley and this is reflected in the choice\nof works. Lots of the pieces have a hypnotic quality and the\nselection reflects Klee's analytic skill.\nKlee's most famous works are probably the early \"Square\nPaintings\". The vivid geometric paintings reflect Klee's passion\nfor colour. As he explained \"To paint well is simply this: to put\nthe right colour in the right place\". The influence of his time in\nAfrica is prominent in these works. The colours are a response\nto the light at dawn and at dusk. Curves reminiscent of North\nAfrican architecture are contrasted with rectangles and\nsquares.\nAs the title suggests the exhibition focuses on the process of\ncreation. \"The Narrative Line\" section focuses on Klee's uses of\nlines and simple geometric shapes to create dynamic and organic images. The pictures have a form that is free from the rhythm\nof the shapes that they are constructed from. A highlight of the\nexhibition was being able to explore the development of this\nnew form of abstraction.\nIn 1935 Klee contracted scl erode rma a disease that reduced\nhis mobility. The delicate construction of images using hundreds\nof repeating shapes is replaced by sparse symbolic shapes and\ncoarse lines.\nThe exhibition is a lively display of Klee's talents and also a chance to study the methods of one of the great abstraction is ts of the last century. The Nature of Abstraction is at the Hayward\nGallery SE1 until April 1 and costs students \u00a36.\nSergio Jon & Trevor\n\n"

Giving us a selection of offerings to show the unacquainted audience precisely what solid matter they're made of,\nthey started big and ended big, just like a band should (and\ngained top points for effective use of a star cloth!). The highlights of the set were their dynamic recent single Splinter and\ntwo very short cover versions - a couple of chords from Ash's Shining Light and the first verse of Jimmy Eat World's Bleed\nAmerican (a short intermission while they tried to recover their\nbassist from the wings). A very classy and original idea from a band that just didn't want to leave the stage.\nBBBBO\nThey're not crazy 'cause they take the right pills every day, they\nbleed Americans and they sweat salt and sugar. They are, of\ncourse, the amazing Jimmy Eat World.\nJimmy Eat World began the evening with the highly successful Bleed American (although whether this could top the totally\nunexpected Seafood version is doubtful). The crowd were\nexcitable to say the least - at times, the number of crowd surfers almost exceeded the number of people with their feet on the\nfloor. The band had astounding stage presence and drive, and\ninterestingly, they introduced a guest keyboardist/vocalist after\nthe first couple of songs.\nThe sheer energy of some of JEW's heavier tracks was nicely\ncontrasted by their mellower, more melodic emo side. Tracks\nlike If You Don't, Don't proved that the band are not only capable of producing large amounts of noise, but also of moving\nadult and child alike. To our surprise, they left the stage before\nplaying new single The Middle. Luckily for us, they came back\nand thrashed it out of their guitars with proper vigour and style.\nThe thing about Jimmy Eat World that confuses us is how\nthey managed to release four albums before anyone had even\nheard of them. But the reason why they became so popular so\nquickly is obvious - emo-core never had it so good.\nBBBBB Jess & Sajini\nLIVE: Hell Is For Heroes +\nKids Near Water @ Borderline\nTonight, I finally laid to rest the ghost of Symposium. Fond memories abound of the \"your best mate's high school band\" vibe of\nthe endearingly gorm less pop-punker s. But drummer Joe Birch\nand baby-faced guitarist Will McGonagle's incredible incendiary rock rebirth buries Symposium under ten tons of blood,\nsweat and, er, piss... ooh look, isn't that Som from My Vitriol?\nBut hang on, rewind an hour or so, and Kids Near Water are\nventing their spleen at a surprisingly unenthusiastic audience.\nSurprising, because they sound pretty similar to HIFH. They\nseem extremely pissed off about something or everything,\nthough between the tunes they seem more apologetic - shame.\nTo be fair, they're not nearly as good as HIFH, but they're still\nexciting in that interesting way that only angry young men with\nguitars and nothing to lose can be.\n\u2022II\nHell Is For Heroes tease us with the almost unbearable buildup of Slow Song. Then, as soon as Out of Sight kicks in, the place\ngoes mental. It's pandemonium, at once a catharsis of all the\nteenage angst of punk and a joyous celebration of the glory of\nrock'n 'roll. Or something like that...\nSinger Justin hangs, monkey-like, from a pipe over the stage\nbefore leaping off and crowd surfing. Surely that's gotta hurt?\nThe rest of the band are equally unflinching. Cut Down and new\ntune, er, New Tune kick particularly hard, powered by\nMcGonagle's angular riffs and the band's sheer rock momentum.\nHell is for Heroes list Fugazi and Deftones among their main\ninfluences. That's setting the bar pretty high, but at their best\nmoments, HIFH manage to weld Fugazi's righteous anger to the\nTones' tide of ill-feeling.\nTheir first single Sick/Happy closes the set and has the place\nin a frenzy again. Will claims that this is what he wanted to do\nall along. Is it, or is he just moving with fashion? Who cares,\nbecause this is incredible stuff. 2002 will be their year, mark my\nwords.\nBBBBB Tommy Mack\n\n"

It was level the\nwhole way through, meaning\nit was tough-going all the\nway, no time for slacking.\nWhich isn't the easiest thing\non a Monday night. They also\nwore the same colour kit as us\nmaking it pretty confusing\nstuff! But there were\nmoments of nice play. This is\nwhere this team is so successful - moments of textbook\nnetball that can only come\nfrom experience!\nWe had cheesy chips for\ntea. Jess turned purple, it\nwas brilliant. She got a bit\ncross and shouted at her\nopponent a lot. Ggrr. Beckie\nas always stayed composed\nand making a swift move at\nthe right time, and potted\nsome beauties (goals really).\nHannah was larg in' it, but\nwent and hurt her ankle, poo.\nRuth had a scary defender,\nvery big girl, who remembered her name at the end to\ncongratulate her - I think she\nfancied me. Eek. Sooz was\ndefending her in the last\nquarter and was just as\nscared but ob vio u lsy didn't work the charm in the same\nway cos she had no such luck.\nKathryn and Clare, ah we love\n'em, no one keeps us as entertained like Clare does! Ruth\nreplaced Ruth in the 3rd quarter (tricky inn it, perhaps I should refer to us as\nRuthybaby and Stux) and Volleyball\nKent have had an unbeaten\nrun in the BUS A championships so far. We lost our\nmatch away in Canterbury 3-0\nlast term so although we were\nlooking forward to facing\nthem with an improved\nsquad, it wasn't without huge\ndoubts about our capabilities.\nThe first set was a close one\nbut we lost it over the last few\npoints 23-25. Kent went on to\ncompletely dominate the second set, winning it 16-25. It\nwas clear that we had problems in reception but also in defence, with inaccurate\nblocking and poor coverage of\nthe court. These were all\nsymptoms of lack of focus.\nWe went into the third set\ndetermined to win at least one\nset. It was another close one\nbut this time it went our way2523. The fourth set demonstrated why we have a team\nthat can go all the way to the\nlast 8 at Loughborough. We\nnever lost our concentration\nand won it 25-20.\nThe deciding fifth set was a beauty. The fired up Kent\nteam had no intention of writing a negative match report\nfor their polished website. Of\ncourse, we had the home\ncourt advantage and by the\nfifth we had inspired our fans!\nIt had a bit of everything,\nback row hitting, blocking,\ndesperate defence, diving, net\ntouches... It was a fight for\nevery point but we were in\nthe lead from the start and we hung on to it to the finish,\nwith a1510 score.\nThe starting line-up was\nYannis, Jussi, Jeremy, Nicolas,\nNikolaos and Etam. Harry and\nMarchetto (the shadow) substituted for Nicolas and Jeremy\nhalfway through the second\nset and Ian and Michael were\nalways there for us.\nplayed as to rmer, as did Claire who came on for Sooz.\nEnough of the confusion, we lost by 3 pants stupid flip pin goals.\nSouthbank were far scarier,\nthe keeper had a constipated\nlook. They were an ars y and\nt etc hy bunch, but no match\nfor the girls in blue (us). It\nwasn'ta very consistent\ngame but it doesn't matter\nbecause we won. Our aim was to score a whole heap of\ngoals to strengthen our position in the league table (we're\n2nd in BUSA) and Hannah\nand Beckie, as always, delivered the goods. Southbank\narrived with attitude - ready\nto claim a walkover because\nwe only supplied one umpire.\nHowever, because of our\nintelligent brain cells\nbetween us, it was right back\nat them as the rules say each\nteam must supply an umpire!\nHa! We won each quarter,\nonly playing our less-than-textbook style in the 3rd qua r ter, because we were feeling\nthe effects of 2 big games in one week. No cheesy chips\nthis time, although Jess got\ngg rr again at her Centre and\nSooz said a rude word, and\nKathryn whacked her opponent around the head, who then lay on the floor being\ncon cussed. It was a Maradonna moment, a classic\ndive, it can't have hurt that\nmuch, the big girl's blouse.\nHow about Kathryn's hand\nafter the impact? It's all me\nme me.

    "content": "union talk\nThrobbing Elections\nDon't leave it to everyone else!\nWith election season fast approaching,\nand nomination papers up for the sabbatical posts at both Imperial College Union\nand ULU, I thought I would write a few\nwords about the whole election business,\nfrom a club and society perspective. You\nshould also be aware that your club or\nsociety's AGM must be held this term, but\nmore about that later.\nSo, the sabbatical elections, what's the\nbig deal? Well, it sounds obvious, but you\nget the chance to choose who you want to\nrun the show next year. For club and society members, the results could have a significant bearing on how easy, or difficult,\nyour lives become next year. This applies\nnot only for the DP(C&S), but for all four\nSabbatical Officers. Perhaps you'll hit\nproblems or you just need assistance or\nsupport in trying out something new; the\nattitude of the Sabbaticals may determine\nwhether you get the kind of help you need\nor the opportunity to go ahead with your\nplans.\nThinking more globally, the UL U Sabbaticals will set the direction of\nLondon-wide campaigns to shape your\nlives as students in the capital, examples\nbeing the LT Travelcards and student\nfinance. So, in both cases, find out about\nthe candidates, ask questions, raise interest among your friends and fellow club\nand society members and, most importantly, cast your vote!\nOn a smaller scale, each club and society will be electing its officers for the following year at its Annual General\nMeeting. This is a great opportunity to\nget more involved, give something back\nto your contemporaries, and gain valuable\nexperience in a whole host of tasks. It\nwould be all too easy to leave it to everyone else to stand for the posts on your\nclub committee; remember, if everyone\ndid that, there would be no club next\nyear. So, take the initiative and go for it;\neven if someone else is standing for the\npost you want, don't let that put you off,\nthe members of your club deserve the\nopportunity to choose the best candidate.\nIf you've already been on your club's committee, perhaps you'd like to take it a stage further and help run all the clubs in\nyour CSC. You could go for Athletics\nClubs Committee Chair, Overseas\nStudents Committee Secretary, Arts and\nEntertainments Board Treasurer, to name\nbut three posts. Any student is able to\nstand for any post on a CSC Executive,\nyou don't have to have experience running a club, but it helps. These posts are\nmore demanding, but you get the satisfaction of helping a broader range of pe o ple, and the knowledge that comes from\nworking more closely with experienced\nUnion staff, as well as the Sabbatical\nOfficers. Without dedicated individuals\nputting themselves forward for these\npositions, the Union quite simply could\nnot operate as it does. So give it a go, put\nyour heart into it, and the rewards will be\nyours at the end.\nRob Davenport\nDeputy President of Clubs and Societies\nPresident Speaks\nElections\nIt is that time of year, and election fever\nwill soon grip us. The first major elections\nare for Sabbatical Officers. These officers\ntake a year out from their studies and get\npaid to run the Union for one year. There\nare four Sabbatical Officers: President,\nDeputy President (Finance and Services),\nDeputy President (Clubs and Societies)\nand Deputy President (Education and\nWelfare), and one who is not an officer of\nthe Union: Felix Editor. They are charged\nwith the day-to-day running of the Union\nand will have a big impact on the fac ili ties, services and support that are provided to you. There is of course an opportunity to come along and question the candidates at hustings. Keep your eye on the\npublicity (posters around College and\nadverts in Felix) for more information.\nSummer Ball\nMost of you should be aware that the\nSummer Ball is now back on. The College\nhas kindly donated a large amount of cash\nto support the Ball. The Summer Ball is\nthe biggest and most expensive event\nhosted at Imperial College and we hope\nto build on the success on last year's event. The event features live acts on\nstage on the Queens Lawn, cocktail bar,\ncasino, fairground rides, obligatory rooms\nwith cheese and dance music and much\nmore. The best thing is that it is a student\nlead event and you have the chance to\ncontribute. So if you are interested in getting involved just get in touch with me\n(president@ic.ac.uk).\nFreshers\nOne of the hottest topics at the moment\nis the welcome that is afforded to fresher s arriving at the College. As most of you\nfound out \"Freshers Week\" is not quite'a week. Indeed some of you might have had\nlectures starting on the first Wednesday\nof term. Due to the heavy work load and\nhighly loaded timetables, there is very little flexibility to allow for these induction\nactivities. I am campaigning to try and\nremove formal lectures from the first\nweek. I believe it is important to have a full and considered welcome which could\nhelp students settle better into the\nCollege life.\nOne group of students where the welcome is especially important is\nInternational Students. Imperial College\nhas one of the highest proportion of international students to be found at any\nUniversity and they can face especially\nacute problems coming to study here.\nMany come from a completely different\nculture and it can take time to adapt to\nlife in London.\nI have started a consultation process\nwith students to find out what would\nhelp. Ideas include allowing International\nStudents to move in halls a day or two\nearlier and bus service to pick fresher s up\nfrom major London airports. If you have\nany views or suggestions on the matter\nplease get in touch with me.\nSen Ganesh\nPresident, Imperial College Union\n\n"

Felix Film\nspars with Ali (Page 16)\nBlack Rebel\nMotorcycle Club, but\nno helicopter (Page 18)\nStudents to Decide Future in NUS\nImperial College students will vote in a referendum to decide whether Imperial should\njoin the National Union of Students, after\nUnion Council narrowly voted last Tuesday\nto put the question to the student body.\nUnder the Union Constitution, referenda\nmust be held within thirty College days of\nthis decision being taken, meaning that a vote on the issue will be held on or before 19\nMarch.\nSpeaking at the meeting, Union President\nSen Ganesh argued that as six years had\npassed since the last such referendum, \" a whole generation of students has not had\nthe opportunity to vote on the affiliation to\nthe National Union of Students,\" and that\nhe wanted to give the students this opportunity to \"have a say in what the Union\ndoes.\"\nThe decision to hold a referendum met\nsome opposition, led by Natasha Newton, a former Union President. Ms Newton argued\nthat similar polls at other universities had\n\"torn the student body apart,\" and that\nsuch referenda \"really stuff up a student\nunion.\"\nShe went on to argue that it would be an\nunwise move to hold a referendum at a time\nso close to exams and elections for\nSabbatical officers, as many students\nwould pay more attention to the vote than\nto revising.\nThere was also dismay at the decision\nfrom Medic students, as it became clear\nthat the referendum would fall outside of\ntheir term time, meaning that a large section of the student population would be\nexcluded from the vote.\nThe most obvious benefit of NUS affiliation is the discounts offered to NUS card-holders by many shops, though many local\noutlets also accept the ICU card. Affiliation\nmay also give Imperial students more representative power, as it would be part of a larger, national body of students. It would\nalso allow ICU members access to more\nwelfare support, which could potentially\noffset the loss of the backing of the\nUniversity of London Union if the College's application to award its own degree-award-ing powers is successful.\nHowever, financing the \u00a356,000 annual\ncost of membership would probably divert\nmoney away from Union clubs and soci-e ties. Prices in the Union bars may also rise,\nas the bars would be forced to use suppliers endorsed by the NUS rather than its\nown, cheaper providers. A spokesman for\nthe bar at the University of London Union,\nwhich uses NUS suppliers, told Felix that\nGrolsch is sold there for \u00a32 a pint, whereas\nit currently costs \u00a31.85 at the Union.\nThe political nature of the NUS is also a major problem, as all member unions must\ndeclare some kind of political affiliation\nThis is certain to conflict with the apolitical\nstance of ICU.\nThe impending referendum is likely to\nbring a new dimension to the Union elections later this month, raising the possibility that candidates may take up a position\nwhen campaigning for Sabbatical positions.\nJohn S\" A rival university held two day\nSci^i Conventions called Microcon, so as ours was even smaller\n?cide fi Pic in.\"\nSize doesn't matter. Or so I'm told.\nSend your Valentine's Day messages to fell x@ ic.ac.uk before\n\n"

    "content": "talk back\nPigeon Fancier?\nDear Felix,\nI had a thought. People who\nknow me often assume that\nthis is a time for me to reflect\non whether or not it is really a good idea, but today I think\nthat I may be on to something.\nLiving in London one is constantly bombarded with two\nthings: Requests for charity\nand pigeons. My thought\ninvolved both. No, I am not\nsuggesting that we just give\npigeons to charity, oh, actually yes I am, but just think a moment. How often have you\nlooked at one of those chickens of the street and thought,\n\"hmm, if I could catch one of\nthose, I wouldn't have to pay\nfor my dinner tonight\"? But is\nit feasible? Like the good scientist that I am, I did a little\nresearch.\nThe average pigeon is\nbetween 28-35cm in length\nand weighs 227g. Removing\nheads, legs and inedible internal organs leaves you with\naround 150g of meat per bird.\nIt is estimated that 30 000\npigeons flock to Trafalgar\nSquare alone every day. Even\nmy rather dubious mathematical knowledge tells me that\nthat is a lot of meat. In fact,\nthat's4500kg of meat that\ncould be put to a good cause.\nHow many people could that\nmuch pigeon feed? Ok, so it's not caviar but the French eat\nhorses and call it civilised.\nFair enough, so it's not a great idea although I can\nthink of an alternative... The\naverage American tourist\nweighs around 90kilos, now\nremoving heads and inedible\ninternal organs\nthat's... bloody Hell. Problem\nsolved.\nPete\nThe only problem I can see is\nthat some fool might decide to\nfarm the bastards 'free range'.\nPigeons, that is.\nRecycling\nDear Felix,\nI agree with the sentiments\nin the article, regarding taking\nan active interest in recycling\nand environmental issues in\nthe world, and the interconnected ness of many issues,\nbut would add a caveat: how\nmany of you actually know\nwhat happens to the waste\nyou recycle, or what the cost\nof recycling is?\nAs far as I know (and\nplease, if you know better, feel\nfree to set me straight), glass\nand aluminium and can recycling does produce a benefit.\nTextile recycling, where they\nare given to charities and re-used, also seems to work.\nHowever, paper and cardboard recycling, in many\ncases, actually uses more pol-lu t ants, such as bleaches etc,\nto render the paper into a suitable state for re-use, and actually would have a negative\nenvironmental impact.\nHowever, the really shocking\nfact is that although many\ncouncils do provide separate\nrecycling facilities, and some\neven collect, like the bin men,\na lot of the so-called \"recycled\"\nwaste ends up in the same\nlandfills as the rest of the\nwaste. I would be interested if\nanyone knows more about\nthis, as my last info was about\n2 years ago, and the situation\nmay by now have changed (at\nleast, we hope so).\nAlex.\nBoy Seeking Girl\nDear Will\nThis is sort of a public service\nannouncement letter:\nIf your name is Lilly or Lillian\nor something and you are in\nthe first year of studying\nbio chem( or something simi-lar) at IC (Falmouth Keogh\nhall???) and were knocked\nover by a white car by the\njunction of Exhibition Rd and\nSome Other Road early in the\nmorning of 2/2/02 then I stopped to help you.

    "content": "film interview\nThis week's film section features an interview with the man who\nhas the task of bringing the story of the Greatest to screen...\nWill Smith\nWillard Smith was born on the 25th September 1968, the second\nof Caroline and Willard Smith Sr. 's four children. His father was\nthe owner of a refrigeration company and he grew up in middle-class West Philadelphia where he got the nickname 'Prince'\n(because of the way he would charm his way out of trouble).\nYears later in 1989 and after embarking on a showbiz career,\nWill Smith starred in the NBC sitcom based on his early life. In\nThe Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, Smith played himself, a street-wise\nteenager transplanted into the heart of Beverly Hills. The series\nlasted six years and set him on the road to super-stardom.\nHis first movie was Six Degrees of Separation (1993), followed\nby the successful action picture, Bad Boys (1995). The Smash-hit\nIndependence Day (1996) secured his position as one of\nHollywood's highest earners. Since then he has made a sequence\nof often dubious, but invariably successful movies, including Men\nIn Black (1997) and Wild Wild West (1999).\nHe is currently working on Men In Black 2 (2002). In the mean-time, audiences around Britain are waiting in keen anticipation\nto see his performance in Michael Mann's, AIL But will Will do\njustice to the legend behind the story?\nIn this interview Will Smith talks about the rigorous training\nschedule required for playing the part, his views on Ali. boxing,\nbeing punched, and his prediction on the Lewis versus Tyson\nmatch.\nHow tough was it to get to the Ali standard of fitness?\nEssentially, we trained for twelve months. I had a little sneaky\nmonth before that where I crept out by myself to try to get into\nsome sort of shape. Little bits so Michael Mann would think\nthat I was already in good shape.\nSo probably twelve or thirteen months of training and essentially we would run at six for three to five miles in the morning,\ndepending on the day, and we would go into the boxing gym\nfrom 10.30 am to 1.00pm. Technical boxing training, jumping\nropes, sparring, and then in the evening we would go into the\nweight room for physical weight training. So that was five or six\ndays a week for a year, so your body would definitely come into\nshape with that kind of regime.\nDid the pain of being punched ever deter you from taking the\npart?\nYeah! That's the first thing! There's a really strange primal thing\nthat happens when you get punched. When you get hit there's a blue flash and you start trying to remember where your car is!\nWhere did I put my keys? As soon as this buzzing goes out of\nmy ears, I'm outta here! But when you get hit and you get\nknocked down and you stand up, there's a really animal is tic thing that happens inside of you that either destroys or reaffirms your manhood.\nThe first time Michael Bentt (who plays Sonny Liston) hit me,\nhe hit me really clean. I didn't have much time to move so I put\nmy chin down and he hit me right on the top of my head. But it\ndidn't flip my head back. It sort of compressed down onto my\nneck and I felt an electrical shock from the base of my neck\ndown to the back of both of my elbows. I remember thinking\n'Damn that Michael Mann!1\nBut it felt like a rite of passage to the\ncommitment that we had all made to telling Muhammad Ali's story; so it almost felt like I was worthy now after getting hit, to\nbe in the ring with all the champions. We didn't use any actors;\nwe only used professional fighters so that sort of confirmed my\nworthiness, in my mind at least.\nWhen you were a young man Muhammad Ali had already\nended his fighting career, but was he still an icon for you?\nThat was what was really important to me about telling this\nstory. I'm thirty-three years old so I was born September 25th1968, so by the time I was paying attention to fights,\nMuhammad Ali had already finished fighting.\nBy that time, he had obtained icon status so I knew that\nMuhammad Ali was an icon. I knew he was a fighter and I knew\nhe was important, but I didn't know why. That was part of what\ninspired me to want to tell this story because anyone that is\nyounger than me has no idea what Muhammad Ali had to\nendure in his life. They just know that their parents love\nMuhammad Ali and everyone claps when he is on television or\nwhen he walks into the room. So I really was inspired to tell this\nstory, however terrified I was!\nI can understand the intimidation of taking the part. Did it\nmake you think 'mmm, perhaps not me'?\nI felt physically perfect to tell the Muhammad Ali story. I felt\nthat I could put the weight on, and that I could look like him. I felt that I could physically become Muhammad Ali, and I felt\nspiritually akin to his transformation from being at a stage\nwhere he believed in God, through to being a man who elevated himself to an individual one-on-one relationship with God. So\nI can relate to that transformation very well. I can relate to that\nspiritual space and I have always felt similar to Muhammad Ali in the simplicity of his spiritual beliefs.\nAt the same time I was terrified by the prospect of being the\nguy that messed.up the Muhammad Ali story They would say\n'Independence Day', that was good! 'Men in Black', that was\ncool! But he's the dude that messed up the Muhammad Ali story!' So, I was terrified by that prospect, until I met Michael\nMann. And he really got the ball rolling in terms of what I had\nto do to be Mohammed Ali. He gave me the belief that it was\npossible for that transformation to occur.\n\n"

    "content": "music reviews\nBlack Rebel Motorcycle Club\nB.R.M. C. Out now on Virgin records\nThere's been a fair bit of hype about this\nband. Judging from the photos on the\ninlay, this is probably due to their live act\n- lots of thrash y guitars, with dry ice billowing melodramatically in the intense\nlighting - and not much to do with their\nmusic. Or maybe pensive, moody male\ntrios with unkempt hair are now back.\nThey name check the Dandy Warhols on\nthe inlay and go in a similar musical\ndirection, but without the humour or the\nflair.\nA sample of the tracks is illustrative.\nOn Love Burns, the lyric \"Now she's gone, her love burns inside me\" repeats\nto three-chord riffs, sounding like a bunch of teenagers practising after\nschool. Whatever Happened To My Rock\n'n' Roll [Punk Song] delivers what it\npromises, though rather un imaginatively. White Palms rolls out a dreary, deliberately muffled bassline, whilst an even\ndrearier vocal moans over the top.\nThe attempt to spice it up with jan gly, muffled Madchester guitars and keyboards only adds to the misery. Rifles is a good attempt at something genuinely\nmoody - multiple repeating voices layered like cant a Gregoriana are entwined\nwith threatening basslines reminiscent\nof the Jesus and Mary Chain. After 90\nseconds though, it suddenly reverts to\npop-rock with indie vocals. The dark\nmood of the intro occasionally reprises,\nbut the dumb indie vocals and post-Oasis guitars ruin the track.\nThe album ends with a couple of tracks\nthat try to sound like Primal Scream but\nend up sounding like Celine Dion with a sore throat. Dull and disappointing.\nRobert\nCooper Temple Clause\nSee This Through And Leave\nOut this Monday on Morning records\nThe Cooper Temple Clause are a band\nwith passion and integrity. That was the\nfirst impression I got when listening to\nthe London live favourites' debut album\nSee This Through And Leave.\nThey don't waste time in getting start-ed, with the omnipresent, minimalist,\nfuturistic arrangements of Did You Miss\nMe? focusing my attention firmly on the\nmusic. The guitar-riffed rock 'n' roll opening of current single Film Maker takes me\ncompletely by surprise, since it could\nhardly be more different from the first\ntrack. It's sleaze-rock, with a hint of\nglam, done in the best possible way.\nPanzer Attack carries on in a similar vein,\nwith older punk influences (Buzzcocks,\nThe Clash) coming through.\nLush orchestral backing features on\nthe bluesy Who Needs Enemies?, which\nis one of the highlights of the album.\nAmber is both haunting and lyrically\nblessed, displaying the band's emotional\nside. This is continued on the simplistic\nRadiohead-inspired track Digital\nObservations, which demonstrates that\nthe band can be experimental without\nbeing irritating.\nThe recent single Let's Kill Music\ncomes through with its '60s style brilliance, its chanting attempting to \"kill\"\nsoulless, manufactured pop through pure\nrepetition. Even a weather report makes\nan entrance - is there anything this band\ncan't do?\nThe creeping The Lake and the atmospherically excellent Murder Song serve to\nclose the proceedings effectively. I'm close to crying now, the album is that\ngood! Go out and buy it!\nS0B9B Sajini\nLudacris\nWord Of Mouf\nOut now on Def Jam South records\nOne of the hip-hop intellectual elite\nLudacris is not. The main subjects \"dis-cussed\" on Word Of Mouf are hoes and\nthe all-important life of a gangsta. But\nunlike many other rappers, Ludacris has\nfortunately picked up a bit of a comic\nstreak, and some of the best moments of\nthis album are the comedic skits.\nAlthough hip-hop snobs may dismiss\nthe subject matter of Word Of Mouf, one\ncannot ignore the production quality.\nTimbaland and Organized Noise (the\nteam behind Outkast classics such as\nWheelz Of Steel) produce the best tracks,\nlike Area Codes and Cold Outside.\nLudacris is a self-proclaimed \"ass vale-dic tori an\" and \"abominable ho'-man\",\nand the tracks where he lets his freaky\ncomedic side run wild are up there with\nany Redman track.\nIt rs when he starts the gun-toting\ngangsta routine that the album falls\napart, and Ludacris turns into a generic\nNo Limit or Cash Money clone. He has\nthe potential to become hip-hop's super-freak genius, and should follow his own\nadvice on Area Codes and \"put the .44\naway\".\nMarcus\nCOMPETITION\nThis week, we've got a copy of Word Of\nMouf (see above) to give away.\nQUESTION: What is the name of\nLudacris' first album?\nPlease email your answer to\nmusic.felix@ic.ac.uk by Thurs 14 Feb.\nSean Regan of Chem EngI knew that\nMotorhead's original name was\nBastard. He wins the Motorhead DVD.\n\n"

As you may all\nknow it is only two days to\nthe Bottle match, or as it shall\nbe known, the Valentines\nmassacre of 2002 where 15\nCornish inbred s shall meet a sorry end. The mighty RS M Rugby team \"The best looking\nteam in IC\" - even more so\nnow that we are missing \"Sir\"\nAlex \"the one man fashion\ndisaster\" Fergusson due to\nhis bionic arm operation in the hope he can star along\nside Arnie in Terminator 3.\nAnyway, RS M is now well\noiled, patched up with a few\nplasters and Enrico has returned the Vaseline now that has been utilised for his\nsexual gratification.\nThe 1st home game of the\nseason and the return of Mr Nigeria saw us up against\nthe Streatham and Croydon\nunder 21 development\nsquad... If any of them were\nunder 21 then Italy will win the Grand slam. Their\nemblem was that of the Penny Farthing, the principle\nreason for this is that they\nwere the engineering team\ninvolved in the development\nof the fine vehicle; when that\nfailed, they turned to rugby. I understand that the front row\nhelped Stevenson design his\nRocket! In any case, the opposition front row had clearly been chewing on spanners all morning, a side\neffect of which resulted in them and their companions\nwearing the sacred black and\nwhite hoops, this livened up\nthe proceedings and as such\nthe RS M Barbarians were\nborn. The resulting mishmash of colours upset some\nof the RS M boys in the first\nfew minutes and we conceded a try and some other\nassorted points, despite the\nBigg Dave (note: big with a GG) tap and catch effort. The\nAfrican Intercontinental\nbreak dance champion Flo,\nfresh from a rendezvous with the anonymous Norwegian bedroom gymnastics queen,\nwas unimpressed, and responded with two quick\ntries assisted by the Angel\nGabriel and Mr Nigeria. Tim\nsuggested that the hobbyhorse was more technologically advanced than the penny farthing and was threatened with violence.\nSegun demanded that the tricycle was quicker than both\nand was hit by ugly geriatric.\nDoug \"dingo\" Smith kept traditions alive by throwing up\non the sidelines as he has\ndone for every fixture. Huy kicked the ball a lot - with style, whereas Ricky should\nhave been shot for his kick-ing, the ball would have\nmade more progress up the\nfield astride a penny farthing\nwith the entire RS M women's hockey team precariously\nbalanced on the handlebars.\n\"Big Gay Mike\", as seen on South Park, was doing a sterling job running round the\npark like a ferret up a drain-pipe, until he became the victim of an unprovoked torpedo\nattack from aU boat somewhere up the Thames and he\nwas broken. Someone took a shine to Mr Grant's neck, so\nhe gave someone whiplash.\nHalf time struck, RS M were\nwinning, so they took the pace man off in the form of\nthe Ambo to give the opposition a chance. Flo fell victim\nto cirrhosis of the liver and\nsexual exertion but not\nbefore claiming a hat trick.\nPez, the rotund Cornish wide-boy with the bad beard and\nhis streamlined eyebrow,\nwent on, but he got a dead\nleg within the time it took Flo\nto order another bottle of\n\u00a3150 champagne. This set the\nstage for the mighty\nYorkshire ripper: Steve \"The\nExecutioner\" Horrocks. Steve\nstood up to his name and\ntried to decapitate a Zimmer\nframe-bearing S&C player\nimmediately with a forearm\nsmash and as such was nearly sent off. We scored lots,\nthey scored once and Segun\ncame off. There was a suspected stroke from one of the\ncoffin dodgers, so Shags\nwent back on as a traitor.\nDoug went down faster than\na two-dollar whore for a try in the corner and snapped\nsomething. The game fin-is he d. No-one knows what\nthe score was, but we won by\nlots to some. Tim was Man of\nthe Match. Dirty pints went\naround quicker than a dose in a soho brothel and Nightingale was a disgrace.\nI 've seen my Nan neck a pint\nfaster than him. We watched\nthe internationals and Ricky\ntold us all how he used to\nplay with the Italian no.7... in the showers! Huy, hope you\nhad a good birthday, If anyone wants to see some shoe\npie being dished out, book a bottle match ticket today.\nBearing in mind that the kit is\nstill in New Zealand. If DHL\ndon't get their act together\nthen the mighty RS M Barbarians might just be out\nto play again. The Bottle\nmatch will be screened live\non Cornish grandstand on the\n16th.
