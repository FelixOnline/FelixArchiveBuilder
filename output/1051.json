    "content": "simon baker\nlife is always unpredictable. West Ham were\nthrashed in the FA Cup by Grimsby, a town that\nis as bad as it sounds. When we thought that no\nmore could ever be needed, more signs have definitely appeared on the BMS site fence, which\nisn't bad for a project that doesn't have planning\npermission (presumably this short respite was to\nallow the fitters to recover from chronic ex haus tion). Most remarkable ol all, the RCS organised\na good annual dinner. No, the RCS organised a bloody brilliant dinner that I for one would never\nhave thought them capable of, had I not'been\nthere. Excellent food, plenty of booze, loads of\npeople and not a embarrassing chant to be heard\nanywhere. Good work fell as! Maybe your previous lapses were due to mercury-induced madness while you were based in your old building.\nWhat have I said...?\nI have often thought about pouring forth to\nyou, dear reader, my views on Europe, and having heard the following, I thought now was the\ntime. Last week, I saw a feature on Watchdog\n(well, a man cannot live on drugs and debauched\nsex alone) about the EU Chocolate Directive.\nThis esteemed piece of proposed legislation,\nfrom the same stable as the straight banana rules,\nwishes to 'harmon is e' chocolate across member\nstates, imposing minimum levels of cocoa solids\netc. Problem is that British chocolate contains\nless cocoa and, God help us, vegetable fat. The\nfact that it tastes better than equivalently priced\nFrench and Belgian chocolate is irrelevant. If we\nwant to continue producing it, we must change\nits name to Vegelate. Wiat the Hell is going on?\nTo defend the European stance, Glenys Kinnock\nwas wheeled on, managing to talk as much sense\nas Stanley Unwin on speed. She insisted that\nsuch a harmon is ation would be desirable, showing perfectly how quickly the environment of\nthe European Parliament has completely\ndestroyed her already questionable mental f acul ties. Such ideas of harmon is ation have dangerous\ntotalitarian overtones, portraying an organisation\nthat seeks to impose drab uniformity on the culturally and socially distinct countries of Western\nEurope. Some would argue that I am simply\nexpounding Daily Mail-style Euro-bashing, but\nthese b army fringe issues serve to illustrate perfectly the wider malaise in the EU. The\nCommon Agricultural Policy adds approximately \u00a320 per week per family to British grocery bills\nmostly so that the woefully inefficient and less\nthan totally honest French, Spanish, Italian and\nGreek farmers can be kept in business.\nThe Common Fisheries Policy has resulted\nin the disgraceful spectacle of British trawlers\nbeing decommissioned while Spanish fisherman\npillage the Irish Sea, catching undersized fish safe in the knowledge that the token inspectors in\ntheir home ports do not give a toss. The Spanish\nstate airline Iberia has just been allowed another\nhuge state subsidy only 18 months after they\nwere told 'never again' by Commissioner Neil\nKinnock, while British Airways has to compete\non its own two feet. The only 'sick man of\nEurope' is this deeply flawed association of\nstates. I do not advocate withdrawal - the idea of\na single market is excellent - but to suggest that\nrather than resolve the problems, we move to\nmonetary union is stupidly reckless.\nBasics Breakfast Cooked Breakfast Only \u00a3 2 . 4 0\navailable Saturday and Sunday 11:45am3.00 pm Basics now open 11:45am10:00 pm daily\nSouthside Shop10% Student Discount\non Bread, Milk & General Groceries\nPlease show your Imperial College Student I.D. card to the cashier before buying\nyour goods as the discount cannot be given once they are rung into the till.\n\n"

    "content": "TWO . FELIX FRIDAY FEBRUARY 23RD1996 NEWS\nBar extensions for\nICU in jeopardy\nBY ALEX FEAKES\nFriday nights at the Union will\nsoon be coming to an end earlier\nthan usual due to a cut in the\nnumber of late bar licences granted by the local constabulary. The\nreduced number of late extensions means that the bar will shut\nat midnight on Friday nights\ninstead of the current 1 am.\nTalking to Felix, Mark\nHome, ICU's Events and Marketing Manager, explained that\nthe nature of the Union's bar\nlicence meant that it had to apply\nfor each bar extension individual-ly. Recent policy reassessments\nand staffing changes in the local\npolice force have led to nearly\nsixty percent of previously\npassed bar extension applications\nbeing rejected.\nNo reasons have been given\nfor rejecting the applications, and\nMr Home was keen to point out\nthat there had been no complaints from local residents about\nthe bar or people leaving the\nUnion late at night. He stressed\nthat ICU's relationship with the\npolice has always been amicable,\ninsisting that the police had an\n'understanding' of ICU's special\nsituation.\nMr Home said that the\nUnion was looking into other\ntypes of bar licences to try to circumvent the problem in the\nfuture. The two currently under\nscrutiny are a 'supper-club\nlicence' and a 'club licence with\nexemptions', both of which\nwould allow the bar to be open\nlate without having to apply individually for each extension.\nHowever, the former would\nrequire there to be food served\nduring the evening, which could\nprove to be difficult, and the latter could require some expansion\nand upgrading of the building's facilities.\nWhen asked about the ramifications of the cut in late\nlicences for the end of term car-niv al, Mr Home would only reply\nthat the matter \"was in hand.\"\nHe gave assurances that the night\nwas fully booked and still on\ncourse to happen.\nShephard promises\ntalks with CVC P BY MIKE INGRAM\nThe Committee of Vice\nChancellors and Principals met\nlast Friday to discuss the looming\ncrisis over higher education fund-ing. The Government's Education Secretary, Gillian Shepherd,\nhad promised to deliver a timetable for discussion of funding proposals in time for the\nmeeting, in an attempt to avert\nthreatened action by the committee (Felix 1050).\nThe meeting took place\namid the continuing row over\nfunding between the Government and university heads.\nAmong principals, adherence to\nthe CVCP's opposition to reducing student numbers to combat\nthe cuts is almost universal.\nHowever, the Higher Education\nFunding Council for England had\nindicated that it might allow universities to take in less than their\ncontracted number of students.\nReducing student intake is a method used by some colleges to\nsave money.\nWhen the deadline for specifying intended intake levels ran\nout a few days ago, only one university had applied to cut num-be rs. The university has not been\nnamed, but it is believed to be\none of the larger 'new' universi-ties. In a late development, the\nGovernment agreed to set up a working party for the whole issue\nof higher education funding.\nUnion capital\nfunding slashed\nBY MIKE INGRAM\nImperial College Union is to\nhave its capital spending budget\nslashed by 28% next year. The\ncuts are being imposed by the\nCollege to offset funding cuts of\nover 31% imposed in last year's Budget.\nThe money is used by the\nUnion to finance facilities and\nequipment used by clubs and\nsocieties. It is distributed by the\nUnion Funding Council (UFC),\nwhich assesses the five-year budget plans submitted by clubs.\nAccording to some, these budgets have already been \"cut to\nthe bone\".\nThe implications of the cuts\nwere discussed at the last UFC meeting on Tuesday. Matt\nCrompton, DP(F&S) told Felix\nthat the Union may be forced to\nuse money from its trading outlets to make up the difference.\nHe said that the Union was\n\"going to try to get money [if\npossible]\", and that it would be\n\"dreadful coming to terms with\"\ncutting budgets any further.\nUsing up the revenue from\ntrading could have an effect on\nICU's future in Beit Quad. The\nprofits had previously been earmarked for improvements to the\nUnion building and its facilities.\nAfter the controversy over the\nEstates Department's proposal to\nmove the Union into the\nSherfield building, it was made\nclear that changes to the building\nwould be necessary (Felix 1038).\nNews in brief BY THE NEWS TEAM\nICU supports nursery-imperial College's Nursery was\nthe recipient of a donation by\nICU this week. The cheque for\n\u00a3104.86 was a combination of\nmoney raised by the Royal\nSchool of Mines Union, the\nweekly bar quizzes in Da Vinci's and sales of matches in the\nUnion's two bars.\nGates locked at night\nAccess from Imperial College\nRoad to Queen's Gate and Prince\nConsort Road will soon be cur-tailed. The two exits from the\ncollege are to be closed between\nthe hours of 11 pm and 6 am.\nThe decision to close the\ngates was taken for security and\nsafety reasons and will be effective from the 1st March. The\nWest Precinct, in front of the\nRector's residence, 170 Queen's Gate, is felt to be a particular\nsecurity risk.\nNick Black, Estates Ma nager, explained that College\nwas \"concerned that anyone\ncould get in\" during those hours.\nHe predicted that only a small\nnumber of students would be\naffected by the closure, and said\nthat the main objections to the\nclosure had been from the college catering staff.\nAlthough there are alternative entrances to the college\ngrounds from Exhibition Road,\nthe status of Imperial College\nRoad as a public right of way is\nconsidered a 'grey area'.\nBeit clock's stoppage\nBeit Quad's clock, hanging above\nthe entrance to the Union, was\nrepaired this week after one of\nits hands became 'mis-aligned'.\nTime was restored on\nWednesday after a three day\nbreak.\nCorrection\nThe band named in last week's Felix as having dropped out of a gig due to one of its members\nbeing banned from the Union\nwas not 'Herb' as stated but was\nin fact the band 'Neither Both'.\nFelix apologies for any confusion.\n\n"

    "content": "The largest environmental protest this country has ever seen recently \u2022 /rsi om took place in a field outside Newbury. Nolan Fell, with a bemused friend > 11ff^)( PT1 ^ff g lT, from Kenya, report from the Newbury Bypass Protesters camp. \u2014 *# hJ> v^il g^g g/g/ Newbury: New England Rises Jacob had never been so cold. Arriving\nfrom Kenya a week ago he had flown\ninto a storm. England, the country\nKenyans tend to look to as the promised\nland, was under a blanket of snow and blizzards were sweeping in from the east.\n\"We have snow on Mount Kenya, but I have\nnever climbed high enough to reach it\" Jacob\ntold me. \"It is beautiful, but a ie! so cold! I can't believe people are sleeping in trees during this\nweather. They must be crazy.\"\nThere were a lot of things Jacob was finding\ncrazy about England. But by far the strangest\nexperience he had had in his first week was\ndemonstrating against the building of a road.\n\"They can build the road in Kenya if they\nlike,\" he said with a grin. \"You should be happy,\nyou're roads are good. In Kenya most roads are\ndirt tracks and good ones built with aid money\naren't maintained and are lull of holes.\"\nI tried to explain that many people now felt\nwe had quite enough roads thank you very much\nand that if we carry on covering our country in\ntarmac soon our ecological heritage would be\ndamaged beyond repair. They were destroying\nSSSIs for Christ's sake. Jacob had never heard of\nan SSSI and I could see he wasn't convinced.\nWe were standing in a field outside Newbury\nwith five thousand other people. Middle class\nlocal housewives mixed with dread locked new-age hippies. One bunch had dressed up as bad-gers, while another held a banner which said\n\"s nog not smog.\" Newbury was the site of two\nmajor battles during the English Civil war\nbetween Charles I's Cavaliers and Cromwell's Roundheads. This, then, is the Third battle of\nNewbury and Middle England, in all its eccentric\nglory, was on die march.\nThe Newbury bypass, if it is ever built, will\npass through three Areas of Outstanding Natural\nBeauty, two Sites of Special Scientific Interest\n(SSSIs), two Nature Reserves, two Civil War\nHeritage Sites, one Conservation Area and make\nsix river crossings. Snelesmore Common, incorporating Snelesmore Woods where three treetop camps are situated, is the SSSI that will be\nmost affected. The road will effectively destroy\n1.2 Hectares and the woods will be cut down.\nThe SSSI contains badger sets and is the home\nto dormice and the night jar, both are endangered\nspecies. Ironically, since the route was\nannounced so much work has been done to\nassess how much habitat and diversity will be\nlost, many species and niches have been disco v ered. The most recent are the\nfamous 3mm snails.\nSSSIs are areas considered vital ^^.Jl\nfor the maintenance of Britain's environmental\nheritage. Friends of the Earth describe them as\n\"the minimum areas necessary to maintain\nBritain's biodiversity.\" In England they are the\nresponsibility of English Nature, who 'notify'\nland owners, local authorities and the Secretary\nof State for the Environment of their existence.\nHowever notification does not guarantee an\nSSSI's survival. Often landowners, particularly\nfarmers, are compensated for loss of profit if\nthey maintain an SSSI on their land rather than\nploughing it over. But when a development project is proposed which will damage an SSSI,\nthen all that is necessary is that \"a balanced decision is reached\". In the case of the Newbury\nbypass, although numerous studies have been\nmade on the anticipated release of congestion in\nNewbury itself, the interpretations of which are\na major cause of debate, no proper environmental impact assessment has taken place.\nUltimately the decision as to whether development should take place in an SSSI is made by\nthe appropriate Secretaries of State. In the case\nof Newbury, presumably the Secretaries of State\nfor Transport and the Environment got together\nand made a balanced decision that the road\nshould be built.\nThis balanced decision had a lot to do with the\nanticipated reduction in traffic through\nNewbury, which will undoubtedly improve the\nenvironment in the centre of town, but many\nlocal residents are worried that the road will lead\nto industrial growth around the town and within a few years they will be back to the same level\nof congestion, but with a town twice the size.\nIf the bypass is built, the land between it and\nthe town will become prime real estate. At the\nmoment any plans for development on this land\nare officially denied.\nWith the level of protest the Newbury bypass\nis attracting - Friends of the Earth are already\nclaiming that the demonstration last Sunday was\nthe largest environmental protest this country\nhas ever seen - the building of the road is no forgone conclusion. To do it the government may\nsplit the country, creating alliances between\nstrange bedfellows in the process. Already a Camp Support Group is being run with efficiency and vigour. Middle-class mothers are providing food and washing facilities for people who\nonly a few months ago would probably have\nbeen barred from their homes\nThe Newbury bypass has become a much bigger issue than simply whether a road should be\nbuilt around an average town in the middle of\nEngland. It has become the focus for the direction oi transport policy in Britain in the next century and reflects a growing clash in values\nbetween those who feel that Britain has reached\nthe point of over development and those who\nwish to maintain the ethos of conventional economic growth.\nJacob had to admire the protesters' courage.\n\"If people are prepared to live up a tree covered\nin snow they must really believe in what they're\ndoing. I remember President Moi burned tonnes\nof ivory a few years ago to stop people poaching\nelephants. I see now it was a good thing; for\nKenyans wildlife is very important. Maybe this is\nsimilar.\"\n\n"

The\nchemistry between De Niro and Pesci is very\nstrong and Scorcese's attention to detail is a maz ing, proving that it really is better to work with\npeople you know well.\nThe film itself is straight to the point with\nplenty of expletives and some horrifying\nmoments of violence including a very unusual\napplication of a vice.\nThese moments are\nalleviated by some\ngenuinely funny\nscenes which spring\nup throughout the\nmovie.\nHowever, Casino's real strength lies in\nthe cast. De Niro\nand Pesci tell the\nstory in a semi-narrative which although\nannoying at first\nactually paces the\nmove very well. De\nNiro gives a characteristically strong\nperformance and\nSharon Stone proves\nthat she really can act. As for Pesci, well he steals\nthe show, his mere presence brings the screen\nalive.\nThe only gripe I have about this movie is\nthat at three hours it is too long, but don't let that\nstop you from going to see this fine example of\nhow movies should be made.\nfilm: ulysses' gaze en ny1 Ulysses' Gaze stars Harvey Keitel as A\", a Greek\nfilm maker working in the United States who\nreturns to his home town of Ptolemais, after a thirty-five year absence, for a screening of his latest controversial film. But he is really returning to\nmake a documentary about the Manakias broth-ers, the pioneers of the Balkan cinema. Three of\nthe Manakias' films are believed to be in the\nSarajevo film archive and so A travels through\nGreece, Albania, Macedonia, Bulgaria, Romania,\nSerbia and finally into Bosnia in search of them.\nOn his travels, he revisits his past and meets several incarnations ofthe same woman with whom\nhe falls in love with again and again.\nUlysses' Gaze contains many shots of\nscenery - a study of shifts of perception and\nemotion. At a coccyx-wrenching three hours,\nthe film possesses qualities which critics seem to\nlove but which will deter the mainstream\naudience.\nThere is insufficient character development\nand any story or plot is masked by director Theo\nAngelopoulos' focus on the landscape. The dialogue is sparse and partly subtitled; what there is\noften sounds stilted. Nevertheless, Ulysses' Gaze\nhas already won the Grand Jury Prize and the\nInternational Critics' Prize at Cannes and a Felix\naward for film of the year.\nOne feels that the camera work lacks pur-pose; the camera lingering pointlessly on a scene\nfor a long length of time. Amazingly, a passage of\nseveral years may occur in just one scene.\nNo doubt Ulysses' Gaze is intended to be\nvery deep and meaningful but unfortunately, it\nfails to stimulate. This is quite a demanding film\nand many will be sitting in the cinema bored and\nleaving with sore buttocks.\n\n"

TWENTY-THREE\nLetters to Felix: Replied top \u00bby rac ii el waiters\nDear Rachel,\nI was intrigued by your comment\nin last week's Felix | 1049,\nFebruary 9th], alongside the Pro\nRector's letter under Official\nFees Line, that \"It seems\nremarkable that there is no official line from Imperial on this\nemotive and controversial issue.\"\nI had thought that the College\nposition was pretty clear. On\npage 3 of the same is s vie of Felix\nthe Rector is reported as having\nreiterated Imperial College's opposition to imposing top-up\nfees. IC has no intention of\ncharging a \u00a3300 fee - it would\nachieve almost nothing for the\nCollege, he is quoted as saying. I would have thought this official\nenough.\nThe idea of a \u00a3300 charge, for\nwhat I now read is described as a \"government deficit levy\", is a discussion item among 100 plus\nVice- Chancellors. But it will be\nfor the governing body of each\nindividual institution to decide\nwhether such a charge is the best\nway of alleviating its financial\nproblems. The Executive\nCommittee of the College's Governing Body fully endorsed\nthe Rector's view at its meeting\nlast Friday. And that's official.\nBest wishes,\nYours sincerely,\nPE Mee\n(Registrar and Clerk to the\nGovernors)\nThank you for putting my\nmind at rest.

Look, jokes aside, but is this\nactually going to happen, or\nwhat? We've had revised deadlines and a reset schedule; gone\nplanning permission in the\nautumn to 'definitely by the end\nof 1995' to 'we'll still be on target if we get it by the end of\nFebruary.'

They all\nseemed keen, enthusiastic, but\nmost strikingly of all, utterly genuine in their desire to contribute\nconstructively to the needs of\nImperial students.

    "content": "six . FELIX FRIDAY FEBRUARY 23RD1996 ELECTION MANIFESTOES\nSABBATICAL ELECT IO IMS i President Here are the manifestoes of this year's sabbatical candidates. Read them well! Voting\nis 4-5 March in all departments, and you need a green Union card to vote.\nLuke Morales What interest do you have in the Union? Do\nyou use it's facilities, from ordering a drink to\nseeking advice or playing for a club? Whatever the extent of your involvement the\ncoming year is important. The Union, indeed\nthe University, is in a state of transition and\nyour vote is one of the strongest ways you\ncan register your opinions in these times of\nchange.\nWhy do I want to be Union President? I enjoy my involvement in the Union and have\nan interest in overseeing its continued\nimprovement in efficiency and com mu nica tion. I hope to ensure that its facilities are\nused to their best potential and that the\nchanges the Union goes through are implemented with full student input and support,\nso that it can continue to provide the best\npossible service to those that care to use it.\nWhy would I be a good President? Much of anyone's aptitude is determined on the job\nbut experience and personality are pre re qui sites. I was an undergraduate at Imperial, a postgraduate and an active Entertainments\nCommittee member at University College of\nNorth Wales (Bangor) and now I'm a postgraduate here. I'm also the Union\nEntertainments Committee's DJ officer and\nhave a key role in the running of events put\non in the Union. I'm friendly, experienced,\noutgoing and easily recognisable and approachable. Come and talk to me! Why should you vote for me?I hope the\nUnion will have a determined, competent,\naccountable up-front President who has a different outlook but excels at working for\nand with others and has everyone's interests\nat heart. I hope you vote for me.\nEither way, you'll find me knocking out\nthe bang in' tunes here until the end of sum-mer. See you on the floor!\nEric All sop \"Why do you want to do that?\" is a question\nthat I have been asked a number of times\nsince announcing my candidature. It is not\nsimply a matter of the quid pro quo clich e(I got a lot out of here, and now it is pay-back\ntime), although this is partially it, but more a question of ensuring that students coming to\nIC in the future have the opportunity to have\nas much fun as I have had.\nHaving spent what some my describe as\na long time at IC, for the majority of which I have been on the periphery of union affairs\nthrough working in the bar and executive\npositions on the IC and C&G rugby clubs, it is\nonly quite recently that I have got more heavily involved chairing ICU Council.\nSo if you elect me, briefly what would I do?\n1998\nIn October 1 9 9 8 there will be significant\nincrease in the number of people on campus.\nIt is important that the union develops plans\nso that its facilities can cope with an increase\nin membership. Beit Quad is the only suitable\nlocation for the union because of its autonomy and the development opportunities.\nThe union must ensure that college provides a co-ordinated response to this challenge as well, rather than putting too much\nemphasis on revenue generating research\nfacilities at the expense of non-academic\nresources.\nSubvention\nThe union must ensure that the level of\nfunding from college does not continue to\ndecrease.\nTo ensure we can support the unions\npresent responsibilities and future developments we must also increase the profitability\nof the unions trading outlets, without increasing prices.\nStudent Welfare\nTop up fees and graduate tax are both\namoral and I will try and ensure that neither\nof them become reality.\nMark Bridge I do not believe that ICU does very much\nthese days, and well understand the disdain\nwith which many view the Union. As President of ICU I will aim to sponsor more\ninterdepartmental forums, fixed events such\nas the recent pan-IC Academic Affairs Day. I plan to explore this because I believe that\ncollege departments, highly devolved, are too\nmuch in isolation to experience the myriad\nbenefits of the complex dynamics that such\nsharing might bring. In striking the balance\nbetween their requirement for a measure of\nindependence and the need for communication I see a role for the Union - an interested\nparty concerned with every aspect of college\nlife and accountable to students.\nIncreasing student awareness of Union\nbusiness is key. An informed and knowledgable student body is essential for ICU to\nwork and I will seek to put in place the constitutional machinery to ensure student information during my term of office. I shall work\nunder the banner 'Redefining the Union',\nseeking to increase its role in the daily running of College, perhaps by exploring the\npossibility of taking a role in managing the\nQT. The College Caterers are not directly\naccountable to students now, something\nwhich is taken for granted in any consumer\norientated market. In setting the stage for\nthe years ahead I hope that College will begin\nto deal with students on a more good faith\nbasis and that the sham that is the social\nprovision in the BMS project will be a thing of\nthe past. Those principles outlined herein will\nguide me through the year, and I shall begin\nto build a new kind of Union for the next mil-lenni um. My election shall be my mandate to\npursue vigorously these aims set out and\nexplore ways to further these principles.\nI1| No |\n! Photo !\n! Supplied !\nii "

    "content": "ASYLUM CHANGES New regulations\naffecting Asylum seekers\nFrom February 5th1996, the\ngovernment have implemented changes to regulations\nconcerning entitlements of\nasylum seekers to social security benefits.\nThree main groups of people\nwill be affected;\n1. Asylum-seekers who have\nbeen found by the immigration authorities not to be\nrefugees (and those who\nappeal against this decision\nwill not receive benefits while\nwaiting for it to be heard)\n2. Asylum seekers and other\npeople from abroad who\nentered the country on the\nunderstanding that they\nwould not be a burden on\npublic funds and who could\nsupport themselves, or who\nhave entered the country illegally\n3. Sponsored immigrants who\nwere allowed into the country\non the condition that they\nwould not be a burden on\npublic funds\nIn other words, a person\nentering the country under a status such as \"student\" or\n\"visitor\" subject to the relevant entry conditions cannot,\nhaving gained entry to the\ncountry, then later claim asylum and expect to receive\nbenefits.\nStudent Asylum Seekers\nStudent asylum seekers\nwould fall into the second category although even before\nthese changes, no full time\nstudents were able to claim\nii l \u00ae sil is fi ill Bi Overseas students who would\nlike to spend some time living\nwith a British family in\nalmost any part of the United\nKingdom are able to do so\nthanks to the HOST scheme.\nIt arranges visits to participating British households creating an excellent opportunity\nto combine a holiday with a genuine cultural exchange.\nAfl you will be expected to\npay is the cost of your travel\nto your destination so if you\nare interested about finding\nout more, further details and\napplication forms are available from the Advice Office.\nYou can apply on your own or\nwith a friend. Applications\nare currently being processed\nfor most weekends up to the\nMay Bank Holiday (25-27th). Care is taken to place students\nwith suitable hosts, for example a lone female student\nwould only be placed with\neither a single female or married couple and other details\nincluding religion (and diet),\npreference for pets and smoking are also taken into\nconsideration.\nincome support or housing\nbenefit unless they met specific entitlement conditions\n(relating to disability or family circumstances for exam-ple). However, a student who\nbecomes afraid to return to\nhis/her home country whilst\nstudying due to changes in\nthat country could previously\nhave applied for benefits if\nfor example, he or she were\nforced to leave the course or\nto switch to part-time study\nwhile the application was\nbeing considered.\nThe government has said that\nin circumstances where\n\"some (people) would be\ntrapped in the UK because of\na major change of circumstances in their home country\nprevents their return after\nhaving arrived here\" then the\napplicant will be able to claim\nbenefits. These countries\nwould be regarded as\n\"Upheaval countries\". To\ndate, no upheaval countries\nhave been declared.\nThe new regulations have\nbeen opposed by all organisations which assist immigrants\nand asylum-seekers. Research\nby the Refugee Council has\nshown that 80% of the\nclaimants they had assisted\nwho did not apply immediately at the port of entry had\napplied within their first\nweek of arrival. They argue\nthat many asylum-seekers\narrive trauma tis ed by recent\nexperiences and are afraid to\napply for asylum immediately\nuntil they can seek advice.\nThey also fear that they will\nbe made to return if they\napply before they have\nentered the country.\nImperial College has a full\ntime disabilities officer who\ncan help and advise students\nwith seen or unseen d is abi li ties. Loretto CTCallaghan is\nbased in the Sherfield\nBuilding, Room 324 and can\nbe contacted on (internal)\n48935.\nDyslexia\nUnseen disabilities include\ndyslexia which is often\nhidden by students who are\nafraid that they will be\ndiscriminated against in some\nway if they make their situation known. As coursework\nbecomes more complicated it\ncan cause increasing\ndifficulties, especially if the\ncondition is not acknowledged by staff.\nAnyone facing any sort of\ndifficulties due to a disability\nof any kind (including temporary problems caused by accident or injury) can speak to\nher in absolute confidence.\nFREE LEGAL ADVICE SESSIONS EVERY WEDNESDAY EVENING56 PM ADVICE ON IMMIGRATION OR HOUSING MATTERS.

    "content": "FEATURE FELIX FRIDAY FEBRUARY 23RD1996. FIVE\nCan rower lines give\nyou Cancer? New evidence which has only recently been made public shows that the risk of contracting cancer from\nexposure to electromagnetic fields (EMFs) such as those from power distribution lines or from domestic\nappliances may be higher than was previously thought. The debate has persisted in scientific circles for some\ntime and has occasionally spilled over into the public domain, but has always ended in indecision.\nEven the very existence of biological effects of EMFs has been challenged on theoretical grounds.\nThe problem with the subject and the reason\nfor this indecision is twofold. It has not been\npossible to come up with a mechanism by\nwhich the relatively tiny fields involved\ncould have an effect on biological tis\nsue, and furthermore, the empirical evidence has not been\nclear cut. New developments on the former\npoint may throw more\nlight on the subject.\nFor instance,\nrecent correspondence in\nthe journal\nNature has proposed a new theory\ninvolving minute quantities of highly magnetic iron oxide present in living tissue, while findings by a team at Bristol University published in the\nInternational Journal for Radiation Biology\napproach the problem from a different per-spec ti ve, and suggest that power lines may\nattract radioactive radon present in the\natmosphere; this is known to be carcinogenic\nand people could be put at risk by inhaling it\nin increased concentrations. With regard to\nthe empirical evidence, there have been many\nstudies which are perhaps epi tomis ed by a study of 232 child leukemia cases in Los\nAngeles over the period 1980-87. This study\nsought to find a relationship between the\ncases of leukemia and the level of EMFs in the\nchildren's homes. The fields were measured\nby two different techniques; one yielded a close correlation but the other did not, throwing all the results into confusion.\nBut now a report recently drawn up for\nthe US Government by the National Council\non Radiation Protection has suggested that\nthe long-term effects of over-exposure are\ndangerous, and therefore advised new levels\non EMF exposure that are several thousand\ntimes lower than current internationally\naccepted norms.\nThis new suggested limit is greatly\nexceeded by the field within 30 yards of\npower distribution lines and is even exceeded\nby many domestic appliances\nsuch as vacuum cleaners,\nhair dryers and food mixers.\nBefore a general panic is\ncreated and people\nstart throwing away\ntheir hair dryers\nand moving\nhouse to get as\nfar away as\npossible from any\npower lines, it should be noted\nhow great the risks actually are. The\nreport highlights two classes of people\nwho are more susceptible to developing\nleukemia than others; workers in the electrical industry and children. The possible\nrisk to workers in the electrical industry\nis estimated to be a few chances in\n100,000 per year. This is a lot smaller\nthan the total risk of death in such\noccupations - the probability of\nreceiving a fatal electric shock is\nmuch greater but it is nevertheless a non-negligible contribution.\nSurveys seem to show that the\nabove- normal risk for children is\nsomething of the order of 5 in\n100,000 (which happens to be about\nthe same as the leukemia risk for in\nutero exposure to diagnostic X rays).\nMerely on a pragmatic level there\nwould be immediate economic implications if these guidelines became law, as has\nalready been seen when companies or local\ngovernment have implemented some kind of\nEMF reduction programme on an ad hoc\nbasis. An example is a town in the US where\na substantial number of power cables were\nmoved underground at an average cost of\n$20,000 per exposed person. The proposed\nguidelines also suggest that in future buildings\nwill have to be designed to shield their occupants from over-exposure, and new schools\nshould not be built near power lines. There\nmay also emerge a new market in 'low field'\ndevices as manufacturers attempt to make\ntheir products more marketable when public\nawareness of the issue grows. Moreover, with\nthe report now public knowledge there may\nwell be a very adverse\neffect on the value of\nproperty near\npower lines.\nIn Britain the\nNational Radiological Protection Board\n(NRPB) maintain that as\nyet there is no definite\nhealth risk from EMFs so at\npresent do not seem to have any\nplans to introduce new legislation.\nThis is one of those issues for which,\nthrough its inherent complexity, it is\nvery easy for the public to be swayed\nin the direction of whichever side happens to make the most vocal case. This\ncould swing public opinion from panic to\napathy.\nEMF exposure is now regarded as a possible cause of cancers and as such it must be\ntaken seriously. More research will have to be\ndone to find any bio physical mechanism which may\noccur and hence the best\nway to prevent its effects. It is a subject about which the public should sit\nup and take notice. Public debate will\nsustain interest and investigation into the\nissue which must not be allowed to remain\nconfined to the pages of scientific journals.\nWords by Inigo Fraser Jenkins.

    "content": "album: the blue tones expecting to fly\nThe Bluetones were first heard by the general\npublic in 1994 with their highly sought after\nFierce Panda e.p., 'Return To Splendour'. With\nthe publicity from this release they were supporting the likes of Shed Seven and Supergrass by the\nend of 1994. Now, with the re-release of 'Slight\nReturn', which went straight into the charts at\nNo.2, they are headlining their own sold out tour\nand are releasing their eagerly anticipated debut\nalbum.\nThe album begins with an aeroplane flying\nover The Bluetones' home in Hounslow, a town\nwhich is now firmly on the musical map. The CD version of the album is divided into two halves just\nlike a traditional record, with a bit of hiss and static in between. It contains the two most recent\nsingles, 'Bluetonic' and 'Slight Return', with their\nunashamedly jan gly guitars, as well as live\nfavourites and new material.\nOne of the stand-out tracks is A Parting\nGesture', a laid-back, blues-tinged outing.\nAnother highlight is 'Putting Out Fires' where\nlead singer Mark reminisces about a past relation-ship. On the theme of relationships, \"The\nFountainhead' is a more personal song which talks\nabout Mark's grandfather.\nThe Bluetones have decided not to follow\nthe current Britpop scene and have produced an\nalbum with individuality and a genuine sense ol\nhonesty. They obviously didn't feel that they had\nto outdo the rest of the crowd because they are\nrightly confident that their music stands up alongside the best.

(4)\nalbum: gin blossoms - ~\n~\ncongratulations, i'm sorry*\nRegular readers of this page may have noticed that\nin recent weeks I have been singing the praises oi\na great many bands. I just hope that this deluge oi\nmasterful albums continues for the rest of the\nyear. A tad unrealistic you might say but given this\nnew album by the Gin Blossoms and the fact that\nthere are a few more positive reviews to come in\nthe next few weeks, you never know - a great\nalbum a week might just be the case.\nSo, what makes this album so good? Well, if\nyou've heard the new single, 'Til I Hear It From\nYou', you should know already. Robin Wilson's lilting voice, Scott Johnson and Jesse Valenzuela's slightly understated guitars and a gentle, nagging-ly persuasive chorus all add up to a tune that you\ncan't say no to. Elsewhere, the likes of As Long It\nMatters' repeat the trick but place even more\nemphasis on Wilson's textured voice.\nNot that the Gin Blossoms get by on just\nbeing mellow. Far from it. Opener Day Job', for\nexample, is a bit of a rock-out with heavy percussion and tasteful guitar histrionics. Given their\npast, wondrous outings such as 'Hey Jealousy',\nthis should not come as much of a surprise and\nmerely points to the band's versatility within the\nmiddle-class American musical framework that\nthey operate inside.\nAnd so, there you have it. Another album\noverflowing with songs that get better every time\nyou hear them. Roll on next week... (8)\n. . . . . .\n\\ n:w;: pH vi^p':. ppv m\"M\"/: Spvv\n\u2022 ^V^A^V^ PVVVPVtij^p Mppp:'y.

It\nwas a fairly intense affair, with\nIC starting on the outside of the\nChiswick bend, and not sid fe ring from this early disadvantage.\nAlthough Oxford had a fast\ncruising pace, they couldn't match the explosive acceleration\nof the IC VIII's. They have obviously improved, as shown by the\nfact that IC later admitted to\nhave been pushed hard for the\nwin, coming in almost a length\nahead in both races.\nThe 2nd eight showed that\nstrength in depth is not dead at\nIC when a crew made up largely\nof fresher s easily overhauled\ntheir Oxford counterparts.

    "content": "film: re ndez vous in paris\ncelluloid guide:,>\u201e. t sp<x) ky\nEric Rohmer's Rendez-Vous in Paris is a compilation of three discrete stories set in different areas\nof Paris and all dealing with meeting or re ndez vous. The first segment entitled 'Rendez-Vous at\nSeven O 'clock' concerns Esther who suspects\nher boyfriend is being unfaithful. In retribution\nshe arranges to meet up with a stranger whom\nshe met at the market, in a cafe her boyfriend is\nsaid to frequent. She has her wallet stolen but is\ncoincidentally returned to her by the woman\nwho is meeting her boyfriend at the same cafe.\nTogether they go to their respective re ndez vous'\nat the same cafe.\nThe second segment, entitled 'Park\nBenches', details a series of meetings between a young woman intent on leaving her fiance, and\nher boyfriend, a young professor, intent on moving from the suburbs into the city. All the meetings take place in the various parks scattered\nthroughout Paris. The third segment, entitled\n'Mother and Child, 1907', tells of a chance\nencounter between a painter and a young\nwoman. The painter becomes instantly infatuated with this young woman, whilst escorting a Swedish friend to the Picasso museum.\nNot a great deal happens in the film, with\nonly the first segment having any narrative dire c tion. Consequently, the majority of the film consists mainly of just a few characters doing nothing but wandering around and talking. Not that\nthis makes a bad film - some of the best Woody\nAllen films are little more than this - but Allen's dialogue is entertaining and the characters are\ninteresting. By contrast Eric Rohmer's dialogue is\nboring and simply breeds apathy for his characters. The first segment is quite diverting but\nunfortunately is also the shortest. From then on\nthe film steadily goes down hill.\nIt is not just the script which is to blame.\nEric Rohmer has done himself no favours with\nhis choice of film locations and methods. One\nwould imagine that any film maker shooting in\nParis would want to make good use of the Paris\narchitecture and sites. By choosing to shoot the\nfilm as a sort of nowhere town Rohmer seems to\nbe defeating half the point of his film. It is, after\nall, supposed to be about re ndez vous in Paris ,\nrather than any other European town. Paris\nimplies a degree of mythic is m and romanticism\nwhich Rohmer manages to totally obliterate with\nshots of building works. The film might have\nredeemed itself somewhat if it was at least scenically shot. However, by using no fancy cinematography Rohmer has ruled out that option as\nwell. In fact at times the camera work is so poor\nas to be distracting and annoying. The actors\ncope with their material but none of them act\nwith any real indication of emotion.\nKendezVous in Paris doesn't pretend to be\nanything fancy but it can't be described as a entertaining small film.\n9,40\n:\nk xh f6.40l||.50,i|:; Sion-fn ii K re Spit\nsit:;\n\u2022 \u2022\n;\n' \u2022\n1\n\u2022 ! :\ni ev cn8.43 Sabri 8.41\n\u2022 :\n. \u2022 \u2022\n0171 7276705\ncasino ll l li:,7.45l gate\nSex.

The app li cation, which should have been\nput before the borough council\nplanning meeting this week, has\nbeen put off until March 7th so\nthat English Heritage may present their views to the meeting.\nEnglish Heritage's involvement in the application plans is a consequence of the listed status\nof the RCS II building.

In her absence,\nF.n glis h Heritage staff were\nreluctant to give details of the\norganisation's intentions.\nThis is the third time that\nthe application has failed to be\nconsidered by the planning meet-ing, and the time allowed for\npossible delays which the building schedule incorporated has\nnow decreased to a matter of\nweeks. Ian Caldwell, Director of\nEstates, did not seem worried\nabout this latest setback, commenting that there was still time\nin hand. He admitted to being\n'somewhat concerned' when the\nplanning authorities last delayed\nthe proposals (Felix 1047).\nThe constituent medical\nschool Unions are still worried\nthat the plans do not make adequate provision for social space\nwithin the BMS building itself. A joint letter from the St Mary's and Charing Cross and\nWestminster Medical School\nUnion presidents, written in\nresponse to an open letter from\nthe Rector, queried the funding\navailable for student facilities.\nWhilst accepting that social fac il ties at their current campuses\ncould not be fully duplicated\nwithin the new premises, they\ninsisted that adequate provision\nmust be made for medical students needs.\nSarah White, president of\nICU, remarked that she knew\nnothing of the letter, and \"didn't know what they were trying to\nachieve\" by not telling her, insisting that the medical school presidents had said they were writing\nthe piece for London Student.\nPHOTO: ALEX FEAKES\nA disguised Duke of Vienna (John Barnes) and Barnadine (Omar\nIslam) of St Mary's Hospital Medical School Drama Society performed William Shakespeare's play Measure for Measure at ICU\nthis week. The two night run of the play on the South Kensington\nCampus marks a first for St Mary's Dramsoc and hopes are high\nthat it will encourage future cooperation between drama societies.\nDirector Jim Coward's intention to move the play into a seventies setting gave a new feel to the play, one that is traditionally difficult to discern as a tragedy or a comedy. Tuesday night saw a small\nbut appreciative audience witness an impressive performance by the\ncast. A full house on Wednesday evening relieved growing concerns\nthat Imperial College students were allergic to cultural stimulation.\nDisc-jockey thieves\nDisco equipment stolen from\nthe Union last week is thought\nto have remained in Beit Quad\nfor a few days before being\nremoved, sparking suggestions of\nstudent involvement. page 3\nCapital funding cuts\nICU face a28% capital funding\ncut in their equipment grant\nfrom College. There have been\ncomplaints that the budgets\nhave already been \"cut to the\nbone.\" page 2\nEnd to late bars\nLate licences to lam on Friday\nnights could soon be a thing of\nthe past as fewer extensions are\ngranted.

Most the tunes\nhave a soulful, funky early '80s feel, and they sit\nwell alongside the smooth beats and breaks.\nThe lyrics display Speech's social conscience,\nas we have come to expect from his previous\nstuff, but it is never clich ed or patronising.

'I'm thinking of hitch-hiking to the\nUkraine, do you want to come?' Alright then.\"\nSuch was the start of it all. A bit too much to\ndrink, and an agreement was struck. Armed with\ntwo rucksacks, two tickets to Ostende (OK, we\ncheated slightly and got a head-start) and some\ndollars, we set out.\nlift no. 1 was negotiated before we left the\nferry by sitting next to the tm cker s' canteen and\nasking them all where they were going. So we\nmanaged to get across Belgium without setting\nfoot on Belgian soil. A few hours' sleep (under a hedge) later, and we were off again. Razul, our\nMacedonian driver, told tales of poverty as he\nhurtled along the autobahn (sometimes without\nbothering to hold the steering wheel) with the\n20 tonnes of latex he was taking to Skopje.\nSeven more lifts later we walked across the\nborder into Poland. A300,000z lot y fine (for\nputting our feet up in the waiting room) nearly\nstopped us catching our train to Krakow. We\nonly had a hundredth of that and fortunately\nthey couldn't be bothered to argue.\nThere's nothing quite like waking up in the\nmorning as your train pulls into a strange city.\nEspecially if it's Zhmerinka, and the first thing\nyou do is buy breakfast through the carriage window cream cheese filled pancakes from a passing grandmother. You rub your eyes, yawn, and\ntry and work out whether you were dreaming -or did they really lift the train up at the border\nand change the wheels?\nOnce in Key I was amazed at the place. It's not a city many people from Britain visit, partly\nbecause it's only 60 miles downstream from\nChernobyl (er, don't drink the tap water) but\nalso because everyone assumes it's full of hideous\nconcrete tower blocks. True, there are some, but\nthey're cleaner and nicer than you'd find in\nBirmingham. The plethora of beautiful church-es, monuments and public buildings is truly fan-ta stic. The Pecherskaya monastery complex by\nthe River Dnepr is stunning.\nThe place is cheap. The bus costs less than\nhalfa penny. Go shopping in state shops, and the\nprices are dead low - although Ukrainian produced food is not recommended due to the possibility that you get some radioactivity (at no\nextra cost) - and you get to experience the\nquirky system of buying things. You queue up\nand ask for what you want, they give you a tick-et, you queue up elsewhere and pay, they give\nyou a receipt, you queue up again and get the\ngoods. A bit like Foyle's bookshop really.\nA quick day out shopping in the Black Sea\nresort of Odessa and it was time to return. A couple of trains took us to the border, and we\nwalked into Slovakia. But this time we didn't cheat - we hitched all the way back.\n[ CU8p m EVERY TUESDAY\nE50 CASH PRIZE\n& more!\nSUPPOFTYD Br STA TRAVEL\n\n"

THREE\nTurntable thieves elude security net\nBY DIP AKG HO SH Imperial College Union's entertainments received a temporary\nblow last week when disco equipment worth nearly El000 mysteriously disappeared from the\nUnion building, amid suspicion of\nstudent involvement in the theft.\nThe equipment, including a Technics turntable, was reported\nmissing last Friday when the\nevening's entertainments were\nbeing set up. The equipment was\nlast used the previous week, the\n9th of February, and was secured\nin a sturdy flight case after the\nnight's disco. Sometime during\nthat week, someone opened the\ncases and unbolted the turntables\nfrom their mounts and took them\nfrom the building.\nMark Home, ICU's Entertainment and Marketing\nManager, has been scanning security videos for clues to the cul-pr its, though admits that the\ncrime is puzzling. \"At least two\npeople must be involved in this\ntheft as the equipment is too\nheavy to be carried by one per-son. They obviously knew what\nthey were taking, as the expensive gear was taken and the rel a PHOTO: ALEX FEAKES\nThis Technics turntable, similar to the one which was stolen, is kept permanently in ICU's ents venue.\nThe thief had to undo heavy bolts which lock the turntable into a flight case in order to make off with it.\nt iv ely cheaper mixer was left. We\nsuspect that students were\ninvolved.\"\nThe Beit archway was the\nonly possible exit route from the\nquad since all exterior doors were\nlocked due to the Mountbatten\nFestival in the Royal Albert Hall\nlast week. The video evidence\nseems to indicate that the equipment is still within the buildings\nin the Beit Quad, but Mr Home\nspeculated that the thieves have\nmost probably escaped with the\ndecks already.\nThe Police have informed\nlocal dealers of disco equipment\nto be aware of anyone trying to\nsell gear matching the description\nof the stolen items. They have\nalso appealed to students who\nmight know anything of the\ncrime to speak to Union officials\nas soon as possible.\nC&G fill Union posts, but\nvoters stay away again\nBY ANDY SINHARAY\nVoting in the the City & Guilds\nCollege Union ( C&GC U) elections took place on Monday and\nTuesday of this week. The posts\non the C&GC U were filled, with\nthe current Overseas Societies\nCommittee chair, Gaurav Misra,\nbeing voted in as president after\nthe 4th count.\nOne of the failed candidates,\nAlex Tylee-Birdsall, said that he\n\"expected not to win really\" and\nwished Gaurav well, saying that\nhe was \"very happy for him...he's a good guy.\" Alex will stay on in\nhis current role as the Motor\nClub's captain but said he may\nrun for the job next year. Andy\nGilder was elected to the post of\nVice-president with Hannah\nPearson as Hon Sec.\nThe turnout for the election\nwas low, with only 276 votes out\nof a possible 3000 being cast.\nThe response was marginally better than last year's, when an electorate of only 190 students registered their preference.\nJez Clayton, the C&GC U current Honorary Secretary, said\nthat the turnout of about 10%\n\"isn't too bad, considering that\nonly 50% of students had Union\ncards.\" He said that some students had got ICU cards especially for the occasion.\nThe post of Honorary\nTreasurer was filled by its current incumbent, Simon Cope,\nand Computing first-year Ling Li\nwas voted in as Publicity Officer.\nThe current VP, Duncan Tindall,\nhas been elected to the post of\nC&G College Association representative. SABBAT1 CAL ELECTIONS BY THE NEWS TEAM\nCampaigning in the Imperial\nCollege Union sabbatical elections has started slowly, though\ncommentators were reassured by\na late flurry in enthusiasm as last\nminute canvassing saw all candidates fully nominated.\nSarah Corneille, a member\nof the women's rugby team, registered her intention to stand for\nthe position of Deputy President\n(Clubs and Societies) with only\nan hour to spare before nominations closed. She is opposed by\nJames Handley and Neil\nO 'Shaughnessy. The presidential\nposition is the only other post\nthat will be contested.

The\ncurrent Deputy Presidents, Tim\nTownend and Matt Crompton,\nhave been mandated to run the\nNew Election campaign, but\nhave as yet failed to publicise it\nas a voting option at all.\nHustings will take place in\nthe Ents lounge (South\nKensington) next Tuesday, and\nin Gladys (St Mary's) on\nWednesday, both at 6pm.

    "content": "Anorexia and bulimia nervosa\nare not primarily about food;\nstarving or binge eating are\nsymptoms of underlying emotional and psychological dis-tress.\nANOREXIA Anorexia is most commonly\nfound amongst people aged\n15-25 and it can often lead to\nbulimia nervosa, which is by\nfar the most common of the\ntwo conditions. About 90% of\nsufferers are women.\nResearch has shown that\nabout 2% of young women\nand 0.2% of young men are\naffected. Over 10% of sufferers die from either the effects\nof the starvation or from sui-cide.\nThe main sym pt on of anorexia nervosa is the relentless\npursuit of thinness through\nself starvation and a fear of\nbeing fat.\nOther sym p tons include;\n1. Severe weight loss\n2. Distortions and misconceptions about weight and body\nsize\n3. Excessive exercising\n4. vomiting/purging\n5. emotional irritable behaviour\n6. difficulty in sleeping\n7. loss of menstrual periods\n8. perfectionism\n9. feeling cold, poor circulation\n10. growth of downy hair\nover body.\nBULIMIA Bulimia Nervosa is characterised by binge eating followed by self-induced vomit-ing, periods of starvation\nand/or purging with laxatives.\nOther symptoms include;\n1. Binge eating large amounts\nof food\n2. Vomiting and/or purging\n3. Often disappearing to the\nlavatory after meals to get rid\nof food eaten.\n4. Secretive behaviour\n5. Feeling out of control,\nhelpless and lonely\n6. Menstrual disturbance\n7. Sore throat and erosion of\ntooth enamel caused by vomiting\n8. Dehydration, poor skin\ncondition\n9. Emotional behaviour and\nmood swings\n10. Devious and deceptive\nbehaviour\nTreatments can take many\nforms and generally must be\ntailored to the particular\npatient. They include co un selling, psychotherapy, cognitive behaviour therapy, group\ntherapy, dietetic advice, day\nhospital treatment and sometimes drugs in the short term.\nRe-feeding must be carried\nout but the treatment must\ntackle the psychological\naspects in order for the treatment to succeed in the long\nterm.\nThe sooner an eating disorder\nis recognised and treated, the\nbetter the prognosis. People\nwith eating disorders are\noften afraid of asking for help\nbecause they fear that they\nwill not be understood, or that\nthey will be treated un sympathetically. Since the causes of\neating disorders are complex\nand will be different for each\nperson affected, it is important to seek help from people\nwho understand the conditions. General Practitioners may\nvary in their experience and\nunderstanding of these conditions but for many, a GP will\nbe the first person they seek\nhelp from.Altematively, there\nare specialist voluntary groups\nwho can provide support and\nadvice in complete confidence. One such voluntary organisation is The Eating disorders\nAssociation which offers a range of services. It has two\ntelephone help lines. On 01603 621414 callers can\ntalk in confidence to someone\nwho understands the problems of anorexia and bulimia\n(9.00am6.30 pm Mon-Fri).\nAlternatively a recorded message can be heard on 0891\n615 466 (but this is a premium line with high charges).\nFinally, students can join the\nassociation for a discounted\nrate of \u00a37.50 per year (full\nrate \u00a320.00).\nFor this you receive information on hospital and self-help\ntreatment, details of your\nnearest self-help group, a bimonthly newsletter and other\ninformation.\nA WIDE FREE LEAFLETS ARE \u2022 iii lj i\" \u2122\nTHE UNION OFFICE ICU ADVICE CENTRE DO YOU NEED FREE& CONFIDENTIAL ADVICE?

FELIX FRIDAY FEBRUARY 23RD1996 ELECTION MANIFESTOES\nDeputy President( Finance and Services)\nPiers Williams\nOnce more ICU is at a turning point.\nContinued government cuts in higher education again look to leave the Union budget\nlevel-funded, if not cut again. Set that\nagainst a backdrop of spiralling costs and the\nimminent influx of medical students onto the\nSouth Kensington campus and it would\nappear the Union is to shortly find itself woefully under-equipped to provide the services\nstudents expect.\nFortunately with the immediate future of\nICU in Beit Quad not apparently under threat\nwe can turn our minds once more to long-term planning, and attempt to make the best\nout of what we have. Historical precedent\nmeans we have some catching up to do as\nregards the union's status as a venue, but I feel that with the right approach great steps\ncan be made, and a pooling of resources\nshould aid struggling clubs and societies.\nSimilarly we must look to our trading\noutlets, and what must be done to continue\ntheir expansion, and improve their already\nhigh standards of service and value for\nmoney. An obvious example is the imminent\nnew bookstore; it seems obvious to me that\nonly a store run by students will be properly\nable to serve the needs of students. Despite\ncollege's obvious attraction to large amounts\nof money from big retail organisations, I am\nconfident that a properly thought-out bid will\nshow them the advantages to the students of\nit being run by the Union (as well as the prestige of it being the biggest student-run bookstore in the country).\nTo conclude: whilst concentrating on\nop timi sing the considerable assets we have\nalready, we must plan wisely to create a better union for the future, one that encourages\nmore active participation. That I stand\nuncontested is a sorry indictment on the status quo.\nFelix Editor and Print Unit Manager Alex Feakes\nFelix's role at IC is an important one, it serves\nto inform and entertain, and provides a platform for those who want to contribute, take\npart or express an opinion. Next year, as Felix\nEditor, I intend to increase participation of\nstudents, encouraging people to write for the\nnews team, review films, plays and music,\nengage in feature writing and photography,\nand also express their opinions. This college\nhas a lot of talented people who I would like\nto see getting involved with their student\nnewspaper.\nIC is often thought of as being apart from\nthe other colleges in London, but this should-n't be the case. Therefore, I would like to initiate much greater contact between Felix and\nthe other student newspapers in London,\nwith the intention of reporting what happens\naround the capital that interests to students,\nwhether it's news or events.\nIt is important to broaden the scope of\nthe news to include stones that are Londonwide as well as local, with a view to covering\nwhat is going on at other colleges. As\nImperial has a wide range of people with a wide range of interests, I feel features should\nstimulate people in areas other than that of\ntheir degree.\nParts of Felix that always attract a lot of\ninterest from students are the sports pages,\ncolumns and letters. I think that sports could\nbenefit from more dedicated coverage and\nFelix should give people the opportunity to\nexpress their opinion on what occurs around\ncollege. To this end, I would like to institute\nan open forum where students can comment\nand analyse on any subject.\nThere is need for the Print Unit, which\npartially funds Felix, to secure more income\nto offset a drop in funding and rise in paper\nprices.\nAll Posts New Election\nHi there! Tim and Matt, your current Deputy\nPresidents, speaking. We're running the\ncampaign for Mr N. Election (or 'Ron' to his\nfriends) as we can't seem to contact him.\nHowever, despite this startling lack of\ncommunication with the sabbatical candidate there is one thing we can guarantee on\nhis behalf. You are no more likely to see him\nif he is elected (How many of the other candidates will dare make that claim?)\nSo, why vote New Election? New\nElection is standing for all posts. If he gets\nelected there will automatically be a second\nelection for that post, held during the summer term. This will enable you to take your\npick from a new crop of candidates, the theory being that they will be better than the last\nlot. Therefore, if you feel that the candidates\nstanding for any post are not up to the job,\nVOTE NEW ELECTION.\nRemember, if you don't vote at all then\nyou can't complain if a completely bone idle\nset of s a bbs get in an ruin it all! Even more\nimportantly, you can't vote at all unless you\nhave a green Union Card! Get one from the\noffice now - you need a photo and the top bit\nof your registration form. Of course, there is\na disadvantage; if New Election does win we\nhave to go through all of this again. So\nplease, for all our sake s, think before voting.\nOK! That's enough of the boring, positive side\nof the campaign. What you really want to\nhear from us is what we think of the can di dates. So here, exclusive to Felix is the negative part of our campaign, where we spread\nunsubstantiated lies and malicious gossip\nabout each of the other candidates.\nThe first person who's reputation we'd like to ruin is X "

This subject has\nbeen raised in previous\nnewsletters and is also dealt\nwith in the Union Housing\nRights Guide (available from\nthe Union reception or the\nac como dati on office). As we\nare still in the grip of winter, it\nis worth raising the matter\nagain. Carbon monoxide\npoisoning is often caused by\nolder gas appliances\nparticularly where there is no\nvent on an outside wall which\nensures that waste products\ndo not build up inside the\nroom.Landlords are now\nlegally responsible for ensuring that any gas appliances\nare safety checked once a year. Danger signs include:\nl. Soot stains or d is colouring on a gas fire or at the top of a water heater\n2. A yellow or orange flame\n3. A strange smell when a gas\nappliance is on.\nIf you are in any doubts\nregarding the safety of any\nappliances then you should\napproach your landlord to get\nthem serviced. If he refuses to\ndo this, contact your local\nenvironmental health officer\nor phone the gas safety action\nline on 0800 300 363.\nEvery year 30 to 40 people\ndie from the use of faulty\nappliances. Sadly, students\nliving in \"low cost\" private\nrented ac como dati on are\noften included amongst the\nvictims.\nsee vo u IN COUKI t SMALL CLAIMS COURT The Small Claims limit has\nbeen increased from \u00a31000 to\n\u00a33000 from January 1996.\nThis is good news for anyone\nwho finds themselves needing\nto take action to recover\nmonies from rogue sellers or\nsuppliers of faulty services as\noften, the amounts involved\nmight have previously\nexceeded the old limit.\nTaking a case to the small\nclaims court is extremely\nstraightforward and relatively\nexpensive (costing lOp per \u00a31\nclaimed or less for larger\nsums). Another benefit to the\nplaintiff is that solicitors costs\ncannot be claimed by either\nside (although you can claim\nthe costs of issuing the sum-mons). The process involves\nwriting a letter to the other\nparty setting out the details of\nyour claim, issuing a summons and then waiting for the\ndefendant to respond. If the\ncase is contested then it is\nresolved in an arbitration\nhearing by a district judges\nprivate chambers. The hearing is fairly informal (i.e. there is no jury or courtroom\ndrama!). Many cases are settled before this stage. Often\nthe sight of a summons will\nbe enough to prompt the\ndefendant into accepting his\nresponsibilities.\nNaturally, your chances of\nsuccess depend upon you\nbeing able to prove your case\n\"on the balance of pro babil i ties\". However, if the person\nyou are suing does not have\nthe means to pay then you\nmay still be unable to recover\nyour money.\nLeaflets\nThe Lord Chancellor's Department has produced an\nexcellent set of leaflets which\nare available from the Union\nReception area. Anyone who\nfeels that they might have a case would be advised to contact either Trading Standards,\na law centre or the Union\nAdvice Office for initial\nassistance.\nThis newsletter was brought to you by ICU & is just one of the services provided by your\nStudent Union\n\n"

    "content": "ELECTION MANIFESTOES FELIX FRIDAY FEBRUARY 23RD1996. SEVEN\nDeputy President( Clubs and Societies) Neil O 'Shaughnessy Sarah Corneille\nMy major objective as deputy president is to\npublicise the clubs and societies more effectively within Imperial College. This can firstly\nbe accomplished by donating space in the\nJCR from which they can sell themselves\nagain to the student body. The college publications are widely distributed around IC and\nMary's, these publications are an easily available platform with which clubs/societies can\npromote themselves.\nBy having internal college competitions\nenables students to join in for fun. These fun\nteams will give the recognised sports teams\na pool of players with which to field their own.\nWith an increase in the quantity of money\nspent on professional coaching the standards of the teams at IC will increase and\ntake IC back to a position of academic and\nsporting excellence.\nI want to help people recognise the non-sporting clubs and societies. By working with\nthe Entertainment's manager the Union\nbuilding can be fully opened and more accessible to socs. This can be done by making\nuse of the Union building on Saturdays.\nLarger events will incur an increased turnover\nat the door creating a larger revenue for the\nUnion. By having special events in the Union\nthose clubs and societies involved will be\nhighlighted to the rest of college and will lead\nto a higher membership over time.\nA further plan is to have combined\nevents between 'related' societies. For example Opsoc and IC Radio could produce a radio play together, as Dramsoc and STOIC\nproduce a screen play. This will hopefully\nstrengthen these socs. and provide for a greater turn out at there events, as well as\nenhancing the talents of each soc. learning\nfrom the other.\nAll in all, I wish to see more advertising\nof the clubs and societies so that more interest will be stimulated in them.\nSarah is a third year Biologist and I have\nknown her throughout her time at IC. She\nhas always been enthusiastic and committed\nto everything she has been involved with.\nShe is very approachable and particularly\ngood at working with and motivating people.\nDuring her time at college she has been\nan active member of both the Ladies Rugby\nClub and RSM Hockey team. She is now a Re-app in Linstead Hall where she has used\nher skills to organise some hugely successful\nevents.\nFiona Grandison\nAs Deputy President my goals will be clear\nand realistic rather than over-ambitious and\nidealistic, they are outlined below:\n\u2022 I aim to promote the arts by setting up and\nArts week, including societies within college\nand professionals from outside. Continuing\nthe work of my predecessors, I plan to work\non obtaining sponsorship for the arts.\n\u2022 It is necessary to improve health and\nsafety standards for all sporting and recreational clubs, and to ensure the implementation of comprehensive insurance policies for\nall ICU members involved in dangerous activities. \u2022 I would like to gain support for some new\nmajor events with possibilities including a CCU sports day, and continued support for\nan ICU Ball.\n\u2022 .1 will set up a monitoring system to find\nout who is involved in clubs and societies\nwithin the Union. Extending the open door policy of the Union and encouraging communication with students to ensure that the\nfacilities available are fully utilised.\n\u2022 Finally with the merger with St. Marys\nlooming I will continue laying the ground work\nto ensure Union facilities are maximise d and\nimproved, clearing the way for a smooth transition. Simultaneously maintaining the individuality of the CCU's traditions and ident i ties.\nJames Handley\nIn his year as IC Radio station manager,\nJames was highly motivated,committed, and\nalso very capable, and I know he will also give\n100% to this job if elected. As DP he'll\nachieve the best possible for the Union clubs\nand societies, and so I recommend you vote\nfor James on March 4th&5 th. Paul Brown\nAs Deputy President, my aim will be to help\nthe clubs and societies of the Union to be\nexcellent in every way. I believe this involves\ntalking with them as well as allocating\nresources fairly. I am fully prepared to fight\non their behalf, where necessary. I will of\ncourse deal with the issues that arise from\nboth the Charing Cross merger and increasing links with Mary's( hopefully with the help\nof the clubs and societies who are, or will be,\naffected by these changes).\nI think it's wasteful for new sabbaticals\nto totally ignore the work of previous years\nand so I will carefully review existing and proposed projects. I hope to create a coherent\nway for clubs and societies to recycle waste\nwhere possible, and I would love to give first\nyears more encouragement to get involved\nthan just Freshers Fair -1 still remember how\ndaunting my first few months at IC were!!\nI believe I am well qualified for this post;\nAs IC Radio station manager (93/94) I became very familiar with the workings of the\nUnion, but subsequent years spent doings\nthings like learning various musical instruments and rock climbing mean that I have\ndeveloped a broad viewpoint on Union\nissues.\nAs well as being qualified for DP, I know\nI will do the job to the very best of my ability\n- so vote for me!\nJames Handley\n\n"
