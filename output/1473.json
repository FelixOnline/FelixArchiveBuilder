    "content": "Going out isn\u2019t just\nabout cheap shots\nand dance tracks.\nDrink in the atmosphere while you sip your\navant-garde beverage at one of London\u2019s\nbest literary or artistic club nights\nARTS\nFELIX\n22\nArts Editor: Rox Middleton\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nScience fiction still gets a lot of bad press and, while\nthere have been a fair number of stories about bug\neyed monsters, I believe that at its best it can equal\nthe greats of any literary genre. Childhood\u2019s End is\nprobably the finest proof of this.\nA hard science fiction classic, it is a fairly early\nexample of the alien invasion story. Indeed, it has\ninspired TV shows such as V and films such as Independence Day, but is much better than either of\nthem. The aliens here are quite unusual: despite\nbeing known as the Overlords, they have \u2018invaded\u2019\nnot to destroy or dominate humanity, but help it.\nUsing their amazing technology they provide people\nIf you read nothing else\nthis week...\nMaciej Matuszewski speaks up for\nsome first class science-fiction\nChildhood\u2019s\nEnd by\nArthur C.Clarke\nWhat should we be reading next then? If you want\nto see a review of your favourite book in Felix, send\n300-400 words to arts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nwith free and unlimited energy and resources. Spectacular displays of this technology, such as blocking\nout the sun over South Africa, are also used to force\npeople to come together and solve their problems\npeacefully. Violence, however, is never used, with,\nat first, the aliens not even landing or showing their\nfaces.\nOne of the best elements of the story is the mys-tery: why exactly have the Overlords come, what are\ntheir plans and what do they look like? Clarke gives\nus tantalising clues throughout the story and the final solution is both surprising and satisfying in that\nit fits these clues perfectly. This is such an important and interesting part of the plot that the book\ndoes somewhat suffer after a few of the mysteries\nare revealed early in the second half, set several\ndecades after first contact.\nThis being hard SF the science is fairly realistic\nbut it is not the novel\u2019s main focus. This is probably the author\u2019s exploration of how humanity might\nrespond to such unusual circumstances. The first\nhalf of the story shows people\u2019s early reactions, including opposition, and how this is dealt with. In\nthe second Clarke explores what different societies could possibly evolve in the peaceful, technologically and culturally advanced world guaranteed\nby the Overlords\u2019 interference. This section of the\nbook focuses on a single family, which gives a much\nneeded personal and human perspective, especially in the very emotional conclusion.\nChildhood\u2019s End doesn\u2019t have any big space battles or major conflicts. It is, however, imaginative,\nengaging and perfect for all those wanting an introduction to science fiction or simply an intelligent\nread.\nFriday 12 November 2010\nNIGHTCLUB\nTHIS\nORDINARY\nAIN\u2019T NO\nBefore anyone builds up a mental image of\ncockney miners drinking pints of bitter, let me\nset out a few facts. Whilst Bethnal Green Working Men\u2019s Club at one point probably lived up\nto its name, those in charge now clearly don\u2019t\ncare for preserving history. Men in overalls and\nbingo nights have been replaced by perverse\nshows and barmen transvestites.\nSelf-described as a \u2018literary cabaret\u2019, Homework is one of the less racy nights held at\nBGWMC, making for an ideal, gentle midweek night out. Run by Aisle16, a collective\nof young poets, writers and comedians, the\nmonthly night brings together a diverse selection of distractions. Inspired by the story-tell-ing events held by The Moth in New York, this\nmonth saw the group sharing their tales of their\n\u2018worst gig.\u2019Two hours of tragicomic anecdotes\nensued, that would have given even the most\nangelic of souls a few pangs of schadenfreude.\nSurely Salisbury\u2019s funniest export since\nDavid Mitchell, Chris Hicks and his tale of\nthe weekend he discovered his girlfriend was\ncheating on him, caught appendicitis and unintentionally revealed his \u2018massive tattoo\u2019 to\nhis mother in hospital mixed hilarious misfortune with a macabre outlook, all to great\neffect. Tim Clare too deserves special men-tion. Anyone who can carve out an entire set\nbased around the attempted assassination of\nPark Chung-Hee in 1974 is clearly a master\nof their art.\nThe surprise of the evening came from the\nheadlining guest, Johann Hari, more famed\nfor his tenacious journalism and television\nappearances than for his stand-up. Nevertheless, it became apparent that his talents stretch\nbeyond just hard-talk as he hilariously retold\nthe story of his disastrous interview with the\nDalai Lama. But the show was somewhat stolen by John Osborne who told the story of how\nhe kindled a correspondence with kids\u2019 TV\nand radio legend Pat Sharp. More entertaining though was the subsequent breakdown of\nsaid relationship, as John became a cult celebrity for his poem entitled \u201cI Think Pat Sharp is\nLonely.\u201d Despite Pat\u2019s parting plea for John to\nnever read it publicly again, an ingenious ruse\nwas still found to give the poem an airing (I\nstrongly recommend having a google for this\none, but the five minutes I spent on it yielded\nnothing. Ms. Sharp clearly employs an efficient\nteam of lawyers.\nWhilst not side-splittingly funny, the feelgood atmosphere of the night certainly made\nfor a good chuckle, which combined with\nHomework to look forward to at Bethnal\nGreen Working Men\u2019s Club once a month\nWill Prince\n\u201cHe hilariously retold the\nstory of his disastrous\ninterview with the Dalai\nLama\u201d\nthe unconventional d\u00e9cor of BGWMC, gives\nHomework something unique. With the relaxed\nmanner of the performances and the set-up\nsuited towards cabaret nights, the whole affair\nis a very comfortable and pleasantly informal\none, with an entry fee that wouldn\u2019t blow a hole\nin your pocket. Any thorough visit to London\nwould not be complete without an evening at\nBGWMC, be it to Homework or another of the\nclub\u2019s plethora of events. And we work hard\nenough at Imperial, don\u2019t we?\nMonthly at BGWMC, www.aisle16.co.uk/\nhomework-ldn/ for details\nHari, hard-hitting journalist \u2013 usually\n\n"

    "content": "SCIENCE\nFELIX\n10\nScience Editors: James Goldsack\nKatya-yani Vyas\nscience.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nIt Must Be Beautiful\nby Various (edited by Graham Farmelo)\nAnd a few suggestions...\nThis collection of essays is a tribute to mathematics\nand its equations, with contributions from science\nwriters, historians and scientists. They range from\nthe prolific mathematician, Roger Penrose to Imperial College\u2019s very own Professor of Neural Systems\nEngineering, Igor Aleksander. It reads almost like\na biography of mathematics, with historical references and charming anecdotes. The book was put\ntogether by Graham Farmelo (author of \u2018The Strangest Man\u2019) and his own essay on the Plank-Einstein\nequation is a brilliantly concise insight into two of\nthe last century\u2019s greatest minds.\nThere is a personal feel to every essay, with each\nwriter choosing their equations carefully; the writing\nis passionate and exciting, qualities one would not\nusually associate with mathematics. This, for me,\nis the greatest triumph of the book; through its au-thors, it makes mathematics witty, accessible and\naltogether more human, providing an excellent read.\nKatya-Yani Vyas\nDiabetes: is it too late?\nJamie Williams\nAs World Diabetes Day approaches, what can be done?\nDiabetes mellitus is a devastating metabolic\ndisease that has seen cases in the UK rising\n74% from 1997 to 2003 alone. With 4.7% of\nthe UK population suffering with the condition\nand almost 300 million worldwide, scientists\nare trying to understand the mechanisms of glucose control and ultimately, what it is that goes\nwrong. Today brings new challenges as scientists battle with time due to the ever-increasing\nrate of diagnoses, fuelled by a spiralling obesity epidemic. With World Diabetes Day fast\napproaching, what better time is there to make\na difference?\nDiabetes mellitus is a disorder where glucose\nis not regulated effectively and can be categorised as either type 1 (insulin dependent or\nearly-onset) or type 2 (non-insulin dependent\nor adult-onset). Type 1 diabetes is caused by\ninsufficient insulin production, whereas type 2\ndiabetes is caused by insulin resistance, where\nnormal insulin production remains, yet the target organs do not respond to it adequately. Both\ntypes lead to dramatic changes in blood glucose\nlevels and other metabolic disturbances, which\ncan eventually lead to blindness, strokes and\nperipheral vascular disease.\nNeither type 1 nor type 2 diabetes has a definitive cause. However, it is thought that type\n1 diabetes is an autoimmune condition; the immune system begins to attack the body\u2019s own\ntissues. Type 2 diabetes is thought to have a\ngenetic cause, with a major breakthrough in the\nyear 2000 leading to the discovery of one of\nthe genes that contributes to the development\nof the disease.\nObesity and sedentary lifestyles are becoming increasingly common and with harrowing\nstatistics that by 2050 it is predicted that 6 out\nof 10 of us will be obese (with 3 to 4 out of 10\nalready there), this is the most likely explanation for the exponential rise of new diagnoses\nin such a short period of time in recent years.\nWhen the glucose in the blood has been\nused for respiration, hypoglycaemia may oc-cur. Tiredness and confusion, confounded by\nirrational behaviour, are key symptoms and\nultimately it leads to a coma if left untreated.\nThis is always a medical emergency and can\nbe fatal.\nTo complicate the lives of diabetics even\nmore, slow-healing sores and repeated skin\ninfections are something they have to become\nfamiliar with if their glucose is not well con-trolled. Excess water excreted in the urine can\noften leave one dehydrated. This, plus the damage caused to the nervous system by excess\nglucose in their blood, resulting in reduced per-spiration, can lead to extremely dry skin, reducing the defences to outside pathogens. Often,\npatients may suffer from diseased blood vessels\ndue to impaired circulation, making skin infections harder to treat.\nHowever, there is some hope for those who\nadjust to this harrowing future. Professor Sir\nGeorge Alberti, Chair of Diabetes UK and\nSenior Research Fellow at Imperial College\nLondon, told Felix how \u201cnew insulins have\nbeen developed which are better able to mimic\nnormal insulin secretion\u2026 Imperial is at the\nforefront of efforts to produce\u2026 [an] \u2018artificial\npancreas\u2019.\u201d\nProfessor Sir Alberti further adds that everyone can do their bit to prevent developing\ndiabetes: \u201cIncreased physical activity is crucial\n- it does not need to be marathon running - 30\nminutes brisk walking a day will make a dif-ference. Similarly, eating a sensible diet and\nnot becoming overweight is everybody\u2019s responsibility\u201d.\nWith all of this taken into account, diabetes\ncan be an extremely scary diagnosis to have to\ncope with; the worrying, the need to become\nyour own nurse, the pressures of being \u2018different\u2019. Many individuals will develop diabetes\nand reach into denial, refusing to accept that\nthey\u2019re ill, partly due to doctors not being able\nto pinpoint an exact cause to every patient,\nbut also due to its intangibility. Some will not\nrealise the severity of their condition until it\ncomes to the removal of their gangrenous limb,\nwhereas others will adapt relatively easily.\nWhat is important however, is that we realise\nthe potential consequences and costs to society.\nProfessor Sir Alberti believes that \u201cif numbers increase on the present trajectory then either treatment and care will become severely\nsubstandard or the NHS will be bankrupted.\nThis will have a major impact on society as\nwell as on the individuals affected. This is a\nbleak prospect and a major effort is needed\nby individuals, by society and by government\nto change the nation from an obesogenic environment into one where healthy living is the\nnorm\u201d.\nUnless action is taken with a big focus on\nboth lifestyle and self-management, incidence\nwill continue to increase over time, predictably\nfaster than the NHS budget. The question is:\nwill we beat the ticking time bomb?\nDeadly bacteria found to kill cancer\nAmberley Stephens\nWith MRSA recently becoming a bigger killer\nthan HIV/AIDS in America, it\u2019s no wonder\nbacteria are often viewed in a bad light. However, an interest is growing in using some\nbacteria as anticancer agents due to the remarkable tendency of some species to preferentially infect tumour cells over normal tissue,\nand the multiple ways they can be manipulated to deliver drugs or cause targeted immune\nresponses.\nIt is still unclear exactly how certain bacteria such as Salmonella, Clostridium and E.coli\ninfect tumour cells. Professor David Holden\u2019s\nresearch group in the Centre for Molecular\nMicrobiology and Infection at Imperial are\nresearching Salmonella pathogenesis. They\nbelieve that mammalian cells could be particularly vulnerable to infection at specific stages\nof their cell cycle \u2013 stages that cancer cells have\nto pass through in order to replicate.\nIn contrast, Clostridium targets tumour cells\ndue to their depleted oxygen levels. Their\nspores can circle in the blood stream before\nproliferating in solid tumours. They don\u2019t survive as well in the surrounding healthy tissue,\nwhich is oxygen rich.\nThere are several ways bacteria can be used\nto target and kill tumour cells, all of which begin with the attenuation of the selected bacteria and removal of toxicity genes. Bacteria can\nbe modified to carry vectors such as genes for\nthe over expression of interleukin \u2013 2. When\nthe bacteria reach the target they are induced\nto express certain genes due to a change in\nenvironmental factors. Interleukin \u2013 2 causes\nan increase in immune response towards the\ntumours cells resulting in increased clearance.\nAlternatively, engineered bacteria can carry\ngenes encoding enzymes to catalyze prodrugs\ninto active toxic drugs at tumour sites; expression of HSV-thymidine kinase converts guanci-clovir into its active toxic drug.\nSome of the most potent toxins are produced\nby bacteria themselves, such as diphtheria toxin and Pseudomonas exotoxin. However they\nare so toxic they can\u2019t be let loose around the\nbody but need to be conjugated to monoclonal\nantibodies or growth factors targeted to the tumour cells. Pseudomonas exotoxin and IL-4\nhave been fused together as a chimeric fusion\nprotein to target IL-4 receptors, found on brain\ncancer cells but not normal brain cells. Experiments have shown direct necrosis of these cells\nand clinical trials are now in place.\nThere are obviously problems in this emerging area of anticancer therapy. Toxicity of bacteria is always an issue, particularly in the high\ndoses needed to combat cancers. The use of\nbacteria has much better side effects compared\nto usual anticancer drugs which elicit strong\nemetic effects and the most obvious, loss of\nhair. However bacteria are most likely to be\nused in conjugation with anticancer drugs due\nto the current therapies being unable to destroy\nthe whole of the cancerous cell.\nAlthough there are many issues with this area\nof anticancer therapy hopefully it will yield a\nnew weapon to fight against cancer with fewer\nside effects that patients experience with current anticancer drugs.\nFriday 12 November 2010\nFelix Radio Show!\nEvery Monday from 7pm, check out the\nFelix Radio show at icradio.com.

    "content": "IS FRY RIGHT ABOUT\nWOMEN\u2019S\nSEXUALITY?\nT\nhou shalt not question\nStephen Fry? Oh dear,\nI may as well go watch\nHollyoaks and eat a Kit\nKat. While we\u2019re at it, the\nBeatles aren\u2019t just a band \u2013 they are a\nway of life.\nStephen Fry, National Treasure\u2122,\nhas been quoted as saying women are\nuninterested in sex, except as the price\nfor a relationship. Apparently, we\u2019re all lying back and thinking of introducing him to our parents at Christmas. It doesn\u2019t help that I imagine him\nsaying it as General Melchett in Blackadder.\nApparently, he never meant it (not that he never said it, and I have scrutinised his blog on the subject, before you ask). Maybe so, but I think it\nreveals some underlying opinions about women and sexuality.\nSo apparently straight men wish they, like gay men, could frequent the\nshadier areas of Hampstead Heath in hopes of getting their rocks off. Eh?\nMost of the gay men I know just go to a club or bar, the same as straight\nmen and women. Cruising public lavs isn\u2019t a sign of sexuality, it\u2019s a\nproduct of a by-gone era where homosexual activity was forced into the\nshadows. Straight men don\u2019t usually go cottaging, because there have\nalways been plenty of brothels for that sort of nonsense. Women don\u2019t,\nbecause it isn\u2019t the 1800s and we can just go pick someone up in a club.\nIt\u2019s nothing to do with whether women are horny or not, it\u2019s because\n\u2018Let\u2019s go outside\u2019 is a brilliant song, but a poor sex tip.\nAnother strand of his purported argument was that women pretend to\nlike sex to get men to give them what they want, be that money or a re-lationship. It is a patronising opinion to have of women, but also of men.\nIn my experience, they aren\u2019t all sexual junkies, but do on occasion want\nthe relationships ascribed as being a purely feminine desire. They also\nsometimes use sex for monetary gain.\nI think guys have it reinforced to them all the time by our culture, that,\nwhile women may look like they are autonomous beings, secretly, they\nonly ever think about what men are upto. For example, most action films\nwill just include a love interest, if any female character at all, who just\ntalks about how worried she is about the hero. Romcoms, conversely,\nwill feature all sorts of conversations between women, which will almost\nalways be about hating/loving a guy.\nBullshit. Mostly, my conversations with my female friends are about\nbooks, science, music, our friends, our careers. Sometimes, we talk about\nmen. My every move is not dictated by what men want, but what I want.\nIf that is sex, it is regardless of what I can gain afterwards.\nAnd frankly, the idea of sex in a park reeks of cider-infused teenage\nfumblings. Come on Darling, let\u2019s go inside.\n20 felix\nFRIDAY 12 november 2010\nCOMMENT\nComment Editor: Anna Perman\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nI\nsuppose this has got blokes\nquestioning what girls have\nsaid to them on the subject.\nAre you really the best she\u2019s\never had? When she says\n\u201cnobody does it better\u201d, is that a\ncompliment, or a consolation?\nIf I were you, I wouldn\u2019t worry\nmy little head about these things;\nit\u2019s her business if she wants to pay\nthe price of a relationship with your highness. Furthermore, if she is pre-tending, couldn\u2019t she be quieter about it? You have no particular problem\nwith the noise but your mother has been nagging you about it.\nSo why are feminists getting so worked up about Stephen Fry\u2019s claims?\nOne, they are reasonably indignant because they do lurrve sex. Two, they\nridiculously demand equality in all fields in spite of obvious physiological differences. Three, they want men to believe they love sex so as not\nto arouse suspicions of their manipulative ways.\nI, for one, am disappointed that Fry didn\u2019t stand by his comments.\nSincere as he sounds in claiming to have been misconstrued, I suspect\nhe expressed his honest views. However, he realises them near impossible for him to justify, his position being significantly weakened by his\ngender (Ironic, no?). In that department I am far better equipped to crusade for what Fry may or may not really believe in. It is not so absurd\nto believe that women enjoy sex less than men. In fact it is a perfectly\nlogical conclusion to draw from typical female behaviour devoid of actively seeking sex.\nHowever I would be the last to deny that we can enjoy it. Much as it\npains me to say, there is a pink, throbbing elephant in this room in the\nform of a vibrator. One which proves we are capable of enjoying sex.\nThe problem is the widespread inability amongst men to reproduce the\nkind of results that he can.\nHence it is reasonable to generalise that women do not like sex, at least\nnot as much as men do. Essentially man is inferior to the elephant.\nAnd I haven\u2019t even got started on libido, of which men have a far greater supply, this being a universally acknowledged truth. You can hardly\nargue with evolution. Apparently there are girls gagging for it but I can\u2019t\neven begin to explain their psychology except to assume it is some complex product of society\u2019s expectations. Ok, maybe I\u2019ll have to concede\nthat some girls do feel strong natural urges for sex as I can\u2019t know what\nothers experience but I will not accept those feelings as the norm.\nWomen have various motivations to lie about liking sex, and assuming women don\u2019t like sex is reasonable. But we\u2019re all in a pickle if the\nwomen actually enjoying the sex aren\u2019t being believed.\nHey, who said I had the answers? Ask Jeeves.\n\u201c\u2018Let\u2019s go\noutside\u2019 is a\ngreat song, but\na poor sex tip\u201d\nAnna Perman\n\u201cI, for one, am\ndisappointed that\nFry didn\u2019t stand by\nhis comments\u201d\nWays to liven up an\nAutumn evening #19\nTransexual Scrabble.\nAlexandra Nowbar\nScrabble isn\u2019t particularly exciting. I\u2019d go as\nfar as to say that it\u2019s borderline hell, equitable to being locked away with Patrick Kielty.\nIt\u2019s a novelty for the first fifteen minutes,\nbut then becomes a scraping pain on the inside of your skull, as you either get bored of\nthinking of words, or Kielty tries, and fails,\nto be in any way entertaining.\nBut what about the current UK scrabble\nchampion? A pink wig wearing transsexual in a PVC dress called Mikki Nicholson.\nScrabble has suddenly got a bit interest-ing; going from the world of the geek, vigorously masturbating over a thesaurus, to the\nwacky world of sexual ambiguity.\nBut Scrabble isn\u2019t the only autumn activity\nin need of an injection of some joie de vivre.\nI\u2019m quite partial to a game of Risk every now\nand then. It\u2019s actually quite challenging. But\nimagine if Risk involved a bit of actual risk,\npaintball guns perhaps. No longer relying on\nrolling three fives to take Irkutsk, you would\nsimply whip your gun from under the table and relentlessly plaster your opponent\nin paint. Games about world domination\nshouldn\u2019t involve dice. Genghis Khan never\nrolled a dice. He killed, raped and pillaged.\nThose things aren\u2019t acceptable in society\nany more; luckily paintball is.\nShopping too could be spiced up, Supermarket Sweep style. You would queue at\nline up against other would-be contenders\nat the entrance and then fly around Sainsburys, throwing all you needed into your\ntrolley. Tins of tomatoes flying across the\nroom. Screams of delight as you discover a\n2-for-1 deal on Doritos and then, shopping\ncomplete in a PB of fifteen minutes, forty\nthree seconds, you proceed to checkout.\nHere my vision differs from that of the fake\ntanned nightmare of Dale Winton. The self-service checkout machine, the bane of our\nlives with their insistence on everything being in the bagging area, now we fling things\nwilly nilly across the scanner until the supermarket looks more like Get Your Own\nBack.\nMs Nicholson is a prime example of all\nthat\u2019s good with the world. She followed\nher dream and achieved it, smashing the\nstereotype of scrabble players forever. So,\nI urge each and every one of you, no taking\nthe Mikki, please.\nBy Rob Cleaver\nStephen Fry\u2019s claim, that women don\u2019t\ncruise because they are uninterested in\nsex, outraged feminist groups. He claims\nhe was misquoted.The question is...\n\n"

The identification process has hitherto been time-intensive,\nbut a new technique developed in part\nby researchers at Imperial has proved\nhugely successful. Experiments at the\nHershel Space Observatory detected the\nbright infra-red light signals irradiated\nby dusty star-forming galaxies that had\nbeen gravitationally lensed. The location of the nearby galaxy acting as the\nlens could then be narrowed down. This\ntargeted search is far more effective than\nperforming a blind search across the\ncosmos, as previously done.\nBut what exactly are gravitational\nlenses and how do they work? The theory behind them (like a lot of phenomena\nin modern physics) harks back to Einstein, who showed almost a century ago\nwith his theory of General Relativity\nthat mass causes a curvature in space-time. The warped space-time will cause\neverything \u2013 even light \u2013 to bend around\nthe mass, and this effect is intensified\nwhen light passes something as massive\nas a galaxy. This is where the idea of a\n\u2018lens\u2019 comes in to play; light from distant objects can be distorted by the gravity from a nearby mass in a way that can\nincrease the angular size and brightness\nof the object and even cause multiple\nimages of the object to form. Gravitational lensing can be exploited in the\nstudy of high-redshift galaxy structures,\nsince scales can be probed beyond those\naccessible by the largest telescopes in\nexistence.\nGravitational lenses allow far away\ngalaxies to be seen as if they were near-by; some of the lensed galaxies detected by the Hershel Observatory are so\ndistant that they are seen as they were\nwhen the Universe was a tender age of\n2-4 billion years - less than a third of its\ncurrent age. By peering back in time into\nthe early Universe, we can analyse how\nthe building blocks of the Universe have\nchanged since its infancy. Professor Rob\nIvison of the Royal Observatory, Edinburgh, who was part of the team com-ments: \u201cThis relatively simple technique\npromises to unlock the secrets of how\ngalaxies like our Milky Way formed and\nevolved. Not only does the lensing al-Melissa Lever\nBrain power needed for tools\nIn a collaborative effort, Imperial researchers have answered the question of\nhow Stone Age man evolved to craft increasingly superior stone tools. Why did\nit take Lower Paleolithic humans almost\ntwo million years to develop the sophisticated hand-held axe from crude razor-sharp stones? Computer modelling and\nsensor-embedded gloves compared\ncomplex hand crafting skills of one\nearly and one late Paleolithic tool-mak-ing method to assess any differences in\nbrain activity between the two methods.\nThe research team, led by Imperial\nneuroscientist Dr. Aldo Faisal, deduced\nthat manufacturing intentionally shaped\naxe-tools required higher levels of brain\nprocessing and more complex thoughts\nthan shaping sharp stones. This dispels\nprevious theories suggesting that underdeveloped motor skills were responsible\nfor the slow evolution of tool complex-ity.\nThe project required the collaborative effort of neuroscientists, archaeolo-gists, anthropologists and craftspeople\nin order to synthesise theories relating\narchaeological evidence with potential\nchanges in behaviour and cognition.\nThe Lower Paleolithic period of the\nStone Age accounts for 90% of human\nprehistory. Around 2.6 million years\nago (mya) the earliest stone tools, sharp\nstone flakes, were bashed from river\ncobbles with small rocks. Although this\nmethod required reasonably high levels\nof perception and motor skills, intentionally shaped, superior tools began\nto appear 1.7mya. This development is\nthought to be a crucial step in human\ncognitive evolution as it required more\nadvanced mental and procedural capacities and is considered direct evidence of\nthe evolution of more complex human\nbehaviour.\nThe research team replicated the art\nof flintnapping, whereby Conchoidal\nstones such as flint, chert and obsidian\nare shaped into tools using hammer-stones to detach the lithic flakes from\na stone core. They compared the neural\nbases of crafting early Lower Paleolithic\nrazor-sharp stones, or Oldowan flakes,\nand late Lower Paleolithic handaxes\nwith the sensor-embedded data glove,\nwhich recorded digit joint angles to\ncompare grip and manipulative complexity of the crafting hand and stone\ncore-holding hand.\nPrevious research has shown there are\ndifferences in brain activity between\nthe two methods, and this project suggests that the differences are due to\nhigher-level behavioural organisation\nin the brain, rather than poor dexterity.\nDr. Faisal puts the findings into context:\n\u201cThe advance from crude stone tools to\nelegant hand-held axes was a massive\ntechnological leap four our early human\nancestors. Hand-held axes were a more\nPolly Bennett\nuseful tool for defence, hunting and routine work.\u201d\nIn addition to primary findings the research suggests a link between language\nand tool-making activities due to observed neural overlap of these activities\nin the brain\u2019s inferior frontal cortex. This\nregion controls manual grip coordination and the processing of sounds. Earlier research has also identified that later\nLower Paleolithic tool-making differed\nfrom that in earlier periods by producing additional activity in the right hemisphere of the brain, including a region of\nthe Broca\u2019s area. This area is involved\nin higher-order cognition and processing\nlinguistic context. Taken together these\nfindings suggest a link in evolution between increasingly complex cognitive\ncapabilities and the development of lan-guage. Dr. Faisal adds that this \u201cmakes\nthe end of the Lower Paleolithic a pivotal time in our history. After this period,\nearly humans left Africa and began to\ncolonise other parts of the world.\u201d\nI swear I saw this couple in Dalston last week...\nFriday 12 November 2010\nCharlie Harvey\nArthritis\ndrugs help\nmemory loss\n\u201c...one day we also\nmight be able to use\nthese... [drugs]... as\na pre-surgical dose\u201d\nDrugs used to treat arthritis may help\nprevent cognitive problems that can occur after surgery, according to new research from Imperial College London\nand the University of California.\nFor years, doctors have struggled to\nexplain why some patients experience\nconfusion, learning disorders and memory loss, a condition known as post-op-erative cognitive decline.\nResearch from Imperial College has\nfound evidence that the disorder is\ncaused by cytokines, molecules secreted\nby the immune system that transmit information between cells. Surgery causes\na cascade of immune responses, resulting in the increased production of cyto-kines.\nDrugs that target the activity of cytokines are widely used to treat inflammatory diseases, such as rheumatoid arthri-tis, and are known to be very effective\nin humans.\n\u201cThis study suggests that one day we\nalso might be able to use these therapies as a single, pre-surgical dose to\nprevent cognitive decline in susceptible patients,\u201d said Mervyn Mave, the\nsenior author of the study and Chair of\nthe Department of Anesthesiology and\nPerioperative Care at the University of\nCalifornia.\nProfessor Mave and his team gave a\nsingle copy of an anti-cytokine antibody\nto mice before surgically operating on\nthem. The treatment significantly decreased blood levels of a cytokine called\ninterleukin-1 beta (IL-1\u00df), limiting inflammation in the brain and prevented\nthe mice from showing signs of cognitive decline.\n\u201cThis is an important observation, as\nit demonstrates that cytokines are potential therapeutic targets in a wider range\nof diseases, not just autoimmune disease\nand cancer for which they are known\ntargets,\u201d said Professor Feldmann, Head\nof the Kennedy Institute of Rheumatology at Imperial College London.\nIt is hoped that these findings, published in the journal Proceedings of the\nNational Academy of Sciences, could\nlead to human clinical trials within a\nyear.\nlow us to find them very efficiently, but\nit helps us peer within them to figure\nout how the individual pieces of the jigsaw came together, back in the mists of\ntime.\u201d\nDr Loretta Dunne of Nottingham\nUniversity adds that once all the experimental data has been obtained, \u201c we can\nprobe the early Universe on the same\nphysical scales as we can in galaxies\nnext door.\u201d\nGravitational lensing can allow scientists to magnify distant galaxies\n\u201cThey deduced\nthat manufacturing\nshaped axe-tools\nrequired higher levels\nof brain processing\u201d\n\n"

They are a deeply\ncivilized and hospitable people\nwho have suffered grievously:\ntortured by half a century of degrading\nand cruel Japanese occupation followed\nby an ideological war which massacred\nmillions, severed their homeland, and\ndivided their people.\nHistory on the Korean peninsula remains unhealed and a generation of\nembittered and embattled military and\npolitical leaders have presided over sporadic and half-hearted attempts to allow\ntheir people to move on.\nThe human and emotional consequences for families estranged for over\nhalf a century are incalculable.\nDuring my recent visit the Government of North Korea confirmed that\na new round of brief family reunions\nwould take place but Vice Foreign Minister, Kung Sok Ung, told me that \u201cas\nmany as 20 million inter-related fami-lies, first, second and third generation\nKoreans, remain separated \u2013 which is\nwhy reunion of the peninsula remains\nour first priority.\u201d\nThe economic cost of reunification to\nthe South would be phenomenal, dwarfing the oft cited comparison made with\nthe divided Germanys. North Korea,\nafter all, is a country where, only a decade ago, during a pestilential famine,\nan estimated two million people died of\nstarvation.\nThe British Ambassador, Peter\nHughes, recently voiced his concern at\nthe continuing manifestation of chronic\nmalnutrition; and, throughout talks\nwith officials, it was never long before\nthe failure of this year\u2019s cabbage crop\n\u2013 which provides the kim-chi staple to\nKorean families during the impending\nand always harsh Korean winter, was\nmentioned.\nThe cabbage crisis has led to South\nKorea relaxing its high import tariffs on\ncabbage and white turnips (previously\n27% and 30%) and cornering the market in China\u2019s vegetable growing areas.\nScarcity had now led to the price of vegetables in Seoul reaching a historic high\nof nearly \u00a36 per item. In the North, no\nfamily would have access to such re-sources.\nAt Sariwon, 40 kilometres from\nPyongyang, I visited a co-operative\nfarm and saw agricultural workers\nbringing in the last of a meagre harvest.\nAround the fields were blandishments\nand loudspeakers urging the workers\nto redouble their efforts \u2013 but without\nimproved technology, different methods\nFrom death row to founder of North Korea\u2019s first independent university, Dr James\nKim\u2019s story is told by Lord David Alton, in the second part of this exclusive series\nFriday 12 November 2010\nof agriculture, enhanced yields of crops,\nand pooling resources with the South, it\nis hard to see what more the workers can\nreasonably be expected to do.\nWhich is why a political settlement,\nushering in a new era of peaceful progress and development, is so urgent.\nThis was the same situation which the\nKorean-American business man, James\nChin Kyung Kim, found in China 17\nyears ago when he opened the country\u2019s\nfirst foreign joint-venture university.\nThis thriving institution, with 1700\nstudents, places more than 90% of its\nstudents in jobs \u2013 cutting-edge roles in\ntransforming China\u2019s huge agricultural\nsector and in its booming liberalised\neconomy. Dr Kim\u2019s dream is to provide\nthe same opportunities for the North Korean students now entering the Pyongyang University of Science and Technology (PUST).\nThe university had its genesis in\n1987 in a series of intermittent visits to\nPyongyang.\nInitially, he was treated as a curiosity\nby the regime. After the death of Kim\nIl Sung the climate changed and, during a visit in 1998, Dr Kim was arrested\nand thrown in jail, accused of being an\nAmerican spy.\nThe situation appeared so bleak that\nhe was told to write a will - and, in keeping with his vow to give everything back\nto his country - he even told his captors\nthat once they had executed him they\ncould have his body parts for medical\nresearch.\nJames Kim told me that \u201cThe North\nKorean Government was moved and\nallowed me to return to my home in\nChina.\u201d It was the first time someone\nwas released after the death penalty was\nimposed. He made no public complaints\nabout what had occurred and \u201ctwo years\nlater they invited me back to North Korea and asked whether I would forget\nour differences and build a university\nfor them like the one I had established\nin China.\u201d\nDr Kim believes his experience is evidence that the regime \u201ccan be touched\nand messages can be communicated at\nsome level. On a much grander scale we\nneed to deepen the experience of reconciliation.\u201d Through education \u2013 which\n\u201chas the power to transcend nationalistic\nboundaries and promote cross-cultural\nunderstanding and respect\u201d - James Kim\nbelieves the situation can ultimately\nbe transformed. The results will be durable and long lasting but will not happen overnight and \u201cpeace comes with a\nprice.\u201d\nDr Kim asserts that an approach based\non patient love \u201cis the only thing that\ncan touch the heart of souls in North Korea. There is nothing that won\u2019t change\nor be inspired by it.\u201d\nPUST\u2019s small corps of teachers, who\nare committed to ushering in North\nKorea\u2019s \u201cinformation age\u201d, providing\nEnglish language studies which will link\nits coming generation to global society,\nand who are now living in Pyongyang,\nare giving their services for little or no\nrecompense. This is a real service ministry \u2013 and they are looking for others\nto join them for a semester or for a full\nacademic year.\nEventually, Dr Kim wants to see an\nindustrial park created around the PUST\ncampus, providing a springboard for\ninternational companies. Ben Rosen,\nthe American venture capitalist and\nfounder of Compaq Computer corporation has visited the campus and believes\nthat PUST will give its students \u201ca window to the outside world and will create\na new generation of technocrats with\nthe potential to lead a post-Kim Jong Il\ngovernment.\u201d\nJames Kim is under no illusions about\nwhat he has taken on: \u201cOur work will be\ncostly and sacrificial in many respects;\nand it will be time consuming and diffi-cult.

    "content": "BUSINESS\nFELIX 15\nFriday 12 November 2010\nrt raising serious money\nGraphics by Victoria McQuadeova\nThe Yale University Investments office is responsible\nfor managing its multi-billion\ndollar endowment. It is recon-gised world over as the bastion by which all other universities with large endowments\nshould be guided. Up until\nthe financial crisis, Yale was\nachieving yearly double digit\nreturns on its investments for\ndecades.\nDavid Swensen, the University\u2019s Chief Investment Officer is considered by many as\nsomething of an investment\nguru and one of the world\u2019s\npioneers in applications of the\nNobel Prize winning Modern\nPortfolio Theory. He has also\npenned an extremely well received book on institutional\ninvestment management and\nis an advisor to Obama\u2019s administration and its Economic\nRecovery Advisory board.\nSeveral prominent endowment managers have passed\nthrough the Yale Investment\nOffice. Alumni of the office\ninclude Jane Mendillo of Harvard, Seth Alexander of MIT\nand Andrew Golden of Princeton, among many others. Swensen and his office have also\nacted as advisors for many\nother endowment managers,\nincluding the University of\nCambridge.\nYale does not achieve its extraordinary returns by simply\nfollowing conventional market\nwisdom. Instead, Swensen is\na master when it comes to\nshying away from financial\nproducts and asset classes\nthat are characterised by high\nlevels of liquidity and traditional lower returns like commodities and bonds of both\nthe corporate and government\nvariety.\nIn his search for alpha,\nthat is, supernormal market\nreturns, Swensen is instead\nheavily focused on alternative\ninvestments like Hedge Funds\nand Private Equity Funds as\nwell as less traditional equi-ties.\nDue to its wild success,\nthe Yale Model has come to\nbe known as the stanfard\n\u201cEndowment Model\u201d. Unfortunately, however, this kind\nof strategy is not at every investment manager\u2019s disposal\ngiven the high assets under\nmanagement necessary for\nits implementation.\ntheir income comes from public bodies.\nIn the United States, most of the top\ninstitutions are completely private and\nindependent institutions that have zero\nneed for the federal government, and are\ntherefore exclusively reliant on their endowments and by default, their alumni.\nThe Adam Smith Institute has advocated\nthat universities should move towards\nan endowment-based model, presumably in order to downplay the financial\nsensitivity of institutions\u2019 income to\ngovernment changes.\nRegardless of the funding model\neach university chooses to adopt, what\ngenuinely matters is their total income.\nA higher total income is a catalyst that\nstimulates better research, affords better\nfacilities, captures more talented staff,\nand chiefly, it ensures an institution is\nable to offer need-blind financial assistance in the form of merit scholarships\nand income-assessed bursaries, guaranteeing that anyone who is academically\ncapable of attending the institution is\nable to do so without the fear of insurmountable debt.\nImperial College\u2019s total funding, is\nabout \u00a3780 million which includes its\nsmall endowment of \u00a356 million. Barring University College London, this is\nby far the smallest sum of any university\nin the World Top 10 as ranked by the\nTimes Higher Education Supplement.\nWere there an award for the world\u2019s\nmost prosperous university, Harvard\nwould be the reigning champion with an\nendowment worth an estimated \u00a317bn,\nwhile in the UK, Cambridge would take\nthis prize with total funding totalling\ncirca \u00a35bn. Imperial\u2019s US equivalent,\nthe Massachusetts Institute of Technology rakes in close to \u00a37bn. This begs the\nquestion of competitivity in the academic market-place to be raised. With vastly\ninferior sums of money, how can Imperial compete in attracting the foremost\nacademics, and ensuring it is the choice\nof the brightest students worldwide?\nIt is no doubt that universities have\nfound the urgent need to become more\nand more self-sufficient. The University\nof Cambridge was the first institution\noutside the USA to raise over \u00a31bn from\ndonations. The drive that was started in\n2005 was completed two years ahead\nof schedule, partly thanks to donations\nfrom over 45,000 alumni. Not to be outdone by its archrival, Oxford University\nis treading similar waters and recently\nlaunched a bid to raise \u00a31.25bn. In stark\ncontrast, Imperial has raised \u00a34m in\nalumni donations since 2003; equivalent\nto just 1.6% of what Cambridge managed to collect. Clearly, Imperial needs\nto do something. While a drive on the\nscale of Oxbridge could prove to be\nsomewhat megalomaniac and potentially unachievable, Imperial needs to do\nsomething significant. The University of\nBristol has recently commenced a drive\nto raise \u00a3100million from its alumni,\nsomething the College could emulate.\nWhile mostly desirable, this self-suffi-ciency does have its drawbacks. Harvard\nand Yale were deeply invested in the financial markets and were keen investors\nin hedge funds and private equity funds\nalike. During the turbulence of financial\nmarkets during the crisis, Harvard and\nYale\u2019s endowments suffered a tremendous blow, losing roughly 30% each for\nthe 2008/2009 financial year, bringing\nthem to a still impressive $26bn and\n$16bn, respectively. While American\nuniversities with smaller endowments\nsaw a decrease in their total value, this\nwas curbed by the fact that, propor-tionally, they held more cash than their\nHarvard and Yale counterparts. Imperial\nfared relatively well during this period,\nin both comparative and absolute terms\nseeing a growth of 11% in total income.\nImperial seems to be keenly aware\nof its financial shortcomings. The College has admitted in its financial report\nthat it \u201chas insufficient endowments on\nwhich it can rely to provide the necessary independence from external funding support\u201d. It has also stated that there\nis a risk that it \u201cwill not be able to compete in the world\u2019s premier league\u201d, and\nthat to do so would require an endowment \u201cequivalent to other world-class\nuniversities\u201d. It has also alluded to the\npossibility of a change in the makeup of\nthe student body as it recently vowed\nto \u201ckeep under review the profile of the\nstudent body in the light of the need for\nfinancial sustainability\u201d.\nImperial must challenge the way in\nwhich it has operated in the past and\nshift away from relying on fees to fund\na significant portion of its operating\ncosts.\nSelf-awareness seems to be Imperial\u2019s virtue here. If the College steps\nup and puts on a stellar funding drive,\nits chances of getting to the end of the\nrace unscathed and maintaining a place\namongst the academic elite will be\ngreatly increased.\nNumbers\nFunding per student\nDonations by alumni\nfunding drives\nGraphics by Veronica McQuadeova\nHow does Yale do it?\nPrinceton\n\u00a31.12 million\nCambridge\n\u00a3400,000\nImperial\n\u00a358,000\nImperial\n\u00a34 million\nsince 2003\nWealth\nHarvard\n\u00a317 billion\nCambridge\n\u00a35 billion\nM.I.T\n\u00a37 billion\nImperial\n\u00a30.78\nbillion\nCambridge\n\u00a3250 million since 2005\n\n"

Sadly this fee did not include the drinks; however you can\u2019t\nhave everything, so sometimes a person\nmust suck it up and buy their own.\nThe bar itself is not especially remarkable as bars go, but that\u2019s not to\nsay it isn\u2019t pleasant and relaxing. The\nreal excitement though lies downstairs\nthrough an archway covered by black\ncurtains next to a pool table and an ancient arcade machine. Through the arch\nis a warm red brick walled room with\nvarious arches and doorways jutting out\nhere and there. Stacks of dusty old volumes lay scattered about with one wall\nin a darkened area apparently made of\nthem, while if you care to look up, the\nceiling appears to be completely covered in small white globes which, on\ncloser inspection, turn out to be several\nhundred old light bulbs. To top it off is a\nsmall modern looking bar, the preferred\nbeverage of which seems to be wine.\nDefinitely not the place for a pint of\ncheap lager!\nThis would be the bar as it stands on\nthe average evening, however on the\nevening of the life drawing it was topped\noff by the addition of about eight mod\u201cThe atmosphere is\nnot a solemn one\u201d\nels (male and female), nude but with the\naddition of all variety of strange garments including feathers, spandex and\nall things alternative.\nThe atmosphere is not a solemn one.\nPeople are there to unwind and enjoy\nthemselves, so you may choose to sit\nand draw quietly or have a quiet chat\nwhilst the poses are on, followed by a\nmuch louder chat in the breaks. I guess\nthe sight of a number of models sipping\npints at the bar, safe in the knowledge\nthat everyone in the room has already\nseen everything and thus not bothering\nto cover up, is an image that sticks in the\nmind.\nYou don\u2019t have to be a brilliant artist\nto go, just a little open minded and up\nfor a bit of fun. Isn\u2019t that what a night\nout should be?\nThese kids are having a good time, artistically \u2013 this could be you! You could be sitting there, discussing \u2018litertatchah\u2019 and listening to Johann Hari. This is staged - in real life, they code...\nThe Book Club is currently running as\nnormal, but advertises a series of regular events including dance and music\nas well as the life drawing. So if you\u2019re\nstruggling to think of something to make\na memorable night out, have a look and\nsee what they\u2019re up to at.\nwww.wearetbc.com. Who knows what\nyou\u2019ll find!\n\n"

    "content": "SPORT\n44 felix\nFRIDAY 12 NOVEMBER 2010\nsport.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nSports Editors: Jovan Nedic\nDavid Wilson\nUltimate Frisbee\nForgotten Sports\nArchery and ice hockey, at least\nyou knew these things were\nsports, but did you know that Ultimate Frisbee is one also? Carina\nCarter didn\u2019t...\nUltimate is a seven-a-side team sport played with a\nflying disc. Played on a rectangular pitch of 100m by\n37m, with two 18m deep end-zones, the object of the\ngame is to score points by having a player catch the\ndisc in the end-zone which they are attacking. Once\nin possession of the disc the attacking player cannot move, but can pass the disc in any direction to a\nteammate. The defending team takes possession if\nthe disc touches the ground, lands outside the playing pitch or is caught by a defender. Games run until a\npredetermined time or points cap is reached.\nUniquely among competitive sports, Ultimate is entirely self-refereed. Any infringements are called by\nthe players themselves, for example a body contact\nfoul, after which the other player involved can agree\nwith or contest the infringement. This relies on the\ntrust that players will compete fair-mindedly and will\nnot intentionally breach the rules. This underlying mutual respect for the opponent is known as the Spirit\nof the Game, inherent to the sport.\nUltimate is played across three divisions: Open (for\nwhich all players are eligible), Women\u2019s and Mixed\n(where teams must comprise of both male and female players). The sport is most commonly played\noutdoors on a grass pitch, but has indoor and beach\nvariations which are played on smaller pitches with\nonly five players.\nWidely played at university level, the UK also boasts\nsome of the best club teams in Europe. Most club\ntournaments are held from November until August,\nwith European Championships held annually and\nWorld Championships every four years. Some of the\nlargest tournaments in the UK see over five hundred\nplayers compete and, with its growing reputation as a\nfast-paced, intense sport, Ultimate looks set to continue to attract new players to the game.\nPhil Sandwell\nWhat is Ultimate Frisbee?\nUltimate frisbee:\nbecause just throwing it\nabout in the park is crap\nI\u2019m sure many of you (me included) thought\nthat frisbee was just a game you played in the\npark on a hot summer day to pass time, apparently we were wrong. Who knew before coming to university that it is in fact a sport, let\nalone an ULTIMATE one?! Appearing in the\nUK in the early 70s, Ultimate Frisbee grew in\npopularity and the next few decades saw clubs\nappearing at various universities across the\ncountry. Ultimate Frisbee started at Imperial\nback in 1998. The club currently has around\n40 members and compete in both indoor and\noutdoor competitions.\nThe club have already been out in action\nin several competitions this term. They competed in BUCS open indoor regionals for the\nSouth-East two weekends ago finishing fourth.\nThis puts them top of the second division for\nthe nationals in a few weeks time, where they\nwill compete to retain their title as defending\nchampions-pretty impressive! They also play\nin a winter league, which provides good practice for the nationals.\nIn terms of freshers, the club signed up over\n200 at freshers fair (including 50 girls I was\nenthusiastically told!) and saw 60 people turn\nup to the first session. The club usually also get\na high post-graduate turn out from those that\nhave played for their previous university. No\nprevious experience is required to start playing and new players got the chance to give it\na go at a fresher tournament in Brighton. Four\nout of the five players on the team have to be\nbeginners: \u201cthis allows the freshers to learn the\ngame in a relaxed atmosphere. It\u2019s competitive but there\u2019s no pressure\u201d, says the club\u2019s\npresident Michael Foster, \u201cit\u2019s experience you\ncouldn\u2019t get in a practice\u201d.\nSo does the club also have a social side?\n\u201cYes, we have various events like curry nights\nand Christmas dinner, as well as going to the\nunion after practice\u201d says Phil Sandwell, the\nclub\u2019s secretary. They also seem to have their\nown drinking tradition called the 3 pint chal-lenge. Unfortunately I didn\u2019t get to see this in\naction, but it involves racing in pairs to drink 3\npints through (apparently it has to be McDonalds) straws. The drinking vessel is of course\na Frisbee and the current record is 16 seconds.\nWell, I guess it makes a change from the standard \u2018get it down...\u2019 anyway.\nUltimate Frisbee train in Hyde Park on\nWednesdays (1pm) and Saturdays (11am). If\nyou think that a Frisbee could make your life\ncomplete, or you just fancy giving it a go, email\nultimate@imperial.ac.uk for more details.\nCarina Carter\nFrisbee can indeed be played indoors and you can even wear a headband to play\na club\u2019s policy on crowd surfing on the Friday\nnight.\nSaturday morning the guys woke up to\nhangovers and a parking ticket! Not the best\nresult of the weekend. However with a whole\nnew day of ski and snowboard events ahead\nof them, spirits soon lifted. Unfortunately, the\nlast minute drop-out of the ski team\u2019s only\ngirl resulted in the team not being allowed to\ncompete in the team slalom. However, there\nwere plenty of individual entries in ski and\nsnowboard. The hammering rain was no deterrent for Snowboard captain, Bridgestock, who\nmade it through to Big Air final \u2013 pulling a successful 360\u00b0! Saturday night was the BUDS\nball \u2013 traditionally a carnage-producing event\nthat lived up to expectations.\nAfter an exhausting weekend, drivers Joe\nand Gerry had the task of bringing the minibus\nsafely home; they succeeded! Anyway, despite\nthe torrential rain, it was a awesome weekend\nwith some great results. So, well done boys!\nOnce again, it was time for the Snow sports\u2019\nannual dry slope championships, or BUDS for\nshort. The event took place in Edinburgh last\nweekend, November 4th-6th. With around 70\nuniversities in attendance, it was a great chance\nto meet other snowsports clubs from around the\ncountry.\nA group of 11 Snowsports members travelled\nthe long minibus ride up on the Thursday eve-ning, arriving in the early hours of the morning.\nThis did not leave much time for rest for team\ncaptains Gerry Hawkins, Luke Bridgestock\nand Simon Federer who, along with chairman\nJoe Templeman had to make the 8am captains\u2019\nmeeting.\nThe competitors were joined by a host of IC\nfreshers who offered support through general\ndebauchery from Thursday through Sunday.\nThis was probably spurred on by a certain person\u2019s \u2013 let\u2019s call them JT \u2013 disagreement with\nBeth Burks\nSnowsports at Dry\nSlopes Championships\n\n"

Relax,\u201d I told him. \u201cOkay, let me ask it\nthis way: Is it a shirt place, or a t-shirt place?\u201d\nhe replied.\nGentlemen, don\u2019t worry. The Broadway\nturned out to be male-friendly territory. Owner\nBrenhan Magee explained his inspiration for the\nbar came from The Living Room chain: a sports\nbar that isn\u2019t just about sports. Sure enough,\nflat-screen TVs on the walls were all glaring\ngreen when we visited, which could only mean\none thing: football. However, the venue\u2019s d\u00e9cor\nis sophisticated, with dark wood, exposed brick,\nmirrors and period windows. Our fellow patrons\nwere a well-behaved bunch of 20- and 30-some-things dressed in smart casuals. So even though\nsports is a big theme here, WAGs can safely tag\nalong: not much chance of having beer spilled\non your skirt by rowdy lads here. The staff are a\nfriendly bunch too.\nFood at the downstairs bar is similar to other\nLondon gastro-pubs: salads, burgers, pasta,\nsteak, chips, club sandwiches and the like.\nMy linguine with meatballs was served with\na bunch of grilled Vittoria tomatoes on the\nvine, which provided a nice bit of tartness to\ncontrast with the sweetness of the sauce. My\ndining companion chose the real ale battered\nhaddock with chips and pea puree. Surprise\nsurprise, the french fries were nicely thin. Both\nour dishes came well presented, and the portions were definitely man-sized. Being a girl\nwith a well-developed sweet tooth, I always\nhave space for dessert, but this time I was really struggling. The dessert menu on the night\nwas rather modest: a choice of cheese board,\nrice pudding and apple crumble. To the bar\u2019s\ncredit, the apple crumble seemed home made\nfrom fresh apples, rather than the kind of microwaved pre-fab nonsense one often finds in\npubs. Mains at the Broadway bar start at \u00a37.95\nand food is served every day from 10 am until\n11 pm, with the restaurant staying open until\n12.30am for the night owls.\nShould you desire more sophisticated din-ing, venture upstairs to Brasa, the luxury\nAsador Grill restaurant, where you will find\nwhite tablecloths, candles and all the associated romantic paraphernalia emulating a chic\nNew York loft-style feel for impressing your\ngirlfriend. The owners have tried to create a\nfun sharing experience in South American or\nMediterranean styles, centred around quality meat. The staff seem knowledgeable about\nthe origins of their meat, making an effort to\nseek out rare breeds from around the country to\nspecifically suit the different type of steak, e.g.\nthe large Galloway breed of cow for the large\nporterhouse steak. Steaks are priced from \u00a318\nupwards, and you will also be able to choose\nfrom fresh fish, seafood, pheasant or venison\non the menu.\nLast but not least we must mention the\ndrinks, as this is a bar after all. The connection between sports and beer doesn\u2019t require\na big mental leap, so it goes without saying\nthat lagers, ales and cider are available on tap.\nHowever, there is also an extensive wine list,\nwith all the major wine-producing nations\nrepresented, including France, Italy, Chile,\nSouth Africa, Argentina, Australia, California\u2026 you get the idea. Furthermore, you can\nchoose from a wide array of cocktails, including longs, shorts, martinis and sparkles using Broadway\u2019s exciting homemade infused\nspirits including chilli vodka, pink grapefruit\ntequila and lemongrass & ginger rum, with\nprices ranging from \u00a37.50 and \u00a38.50. One of\nthe featured house cocktails include the Burntdown Tennessee, which encompasses orange-infused Jack Daniels, marmalade and Victorian-style lemonade.\nLocated literally on the doorstep of Fulham\nBroadway tube station, the recent opening of\nBroadway Bar and Grill will be a convenient\noption for students renting accommodation in\nthe area, and is also in close proximity to one\nof Imperial\u2019s residence halls, Orient House.\nBroadway also offers private dining for up\nto 25 people and are now taking bookings for\nChristmas parties.\nBroadway Bar and Grill 474-476 Fulham\nRoad, London SW6 1BY.

Oh\nsure, there\u2019s always some\nkind of weird video of people shooting a bear and doing ungodly things over it afterwards,\nbut I\u2019m not talking about that. I mean a\nsocial media revolution, involving music in particular. Social media is Youtube, Twitter, Bandcamp, and all those\nother websites you might check out once\nin a while for new music.\nOnline publicity stunts have been used\nfor advertising everything from Lost to\nViagra, but what\u2019s particularly interesting with music is that in theory there\nshouldn\u2019t be that much money to be\nmade in music anymore, unless you\u2019re\na corporate caricature copycat. However\nthe traditional \u201cbusiness model\u201d for succesful bands in the past (demo, followed\nby local tour, then indie label, national\ntour, and maybe - just maybe - major\nlabel and world tour) is outdated and\nthe vast majority of musicians never get\npast the first stages. Blame it on trends,\nfaster rates of musical consumption and\nturnover in the iPod age, or simply on\nthe fact \u201cit\u2019s all been done before\u201d, but\nat the end of the day the core dilemma\nremains obvious. If you can just download everything for free - and look past\nBrave New World\nAs the music industry bleeds itself to death a new breed of artists\nemerges online. Greg Power reports\nthe \u201cmoral ambiguity\u201d of loving a band\nand yet repeatedly stealing from them -then why would you ever need to pay for\nan album?\nThis is where forward-thinking artists\nsuch as Trent Reznor and Radiohead\nrealized true, hardcore fans would donate money in exchange for a \u201cfree\u201d record so long as the quality they\u2019d come\nto expect from their favourite band was\nconsistent with their new outtings; regardless of record deals. So there are\nstill viable money-making opportunities available for established musicians\non the internet. But what about the extremely talented dude who just makes\nbeats at home and is too \u201cedgy\u201d or un-PC for labels in the first place? How\nabout projects that look insane on paper\nand will never get funding?\nA new generation of artists has decided that the solution is a DIY-attitude,\nreminiscent of early punk, just more\ngeeky, with more time spent on the internet and post-production software.\nNowadays anyone with a bit of talent, a\nbit of imagination and a lot of time on\ntheir hands can create cutting-edge, interesting and challenging art.\nThe best example of this audiovisual\nwizardry has to be iamamiwhoami, a\nfemale artist possibly from Iceland (and\nChris Dean\nPhoto by Christopher Dean\nIf you want to share a\nmind-blowing playlist send\nit in to music.felix@gmail.\ncom\nIt\u2019s been a tough few weeks for School\nof Seven Bells. The announcement of\nClaudia Deheza\u2019s departure, one of the\ntwin sisters whose vocal harmonies\nmake their sound so distinctive, arrived\nsuddenly and without warning on their\nFacebook account. Fans were shocked,\nand despite their decision to continue\nwith their tour, they\u2019ve received mediocre reviews in her absence.\nSo it\u2019s with trepidation that I step into\nHeaven tonight to see for myself how\nthe band have coped with this recent\nloss. First up however is the special appearance of Jon Hopkins as support.\nThe man who co-wrote Brian Eno\u2019s\nnew album arrives on stage surrounded\nby an impressive array of electronic\nequipment, and over his half hour set,\nmorphs from Animal Collective-like\npsychedelia to full on dubstep. Leaving\nthe stage to the most raucous applause I\nhave ever heard for a support act, he\u2019s\nimmediately placed on my \u2018to listen to\u2019\nlist.\nA few more minutes of waiting, and\nSVIIB themselves appear onstage\ncloaked in darkness to the faint hum\nof synths before launching into \u2018Half\nAsleep\u2019, and the chills down my spine\nreassure me that they mean business.\nWisely, the now-duo use a setlist of\nsongs predominantly from their new\nalbum Disconnect From Desire, relying less on their characteristic harmony\nand more on guitar based ambience,\nresulting in a more cohesive sound.\nMusically, SVIIB have never sounded\ntighter. By employing a live drummer\nas well as drum machine, songs like the\nMy Bloody Valentine-esque Babelonia\nand ILU sound blistering live. With\nthe incredible sound system at Heaven,\nthe wailing guitar lines and pounding\nrhythms push the songs into another\nleague, and the crowd reacts accord-ingly.\nHowever, not everything works. In\ncertain songs you get the feeling that\nsome crucial ingredient is missing: Dust\nDevil, one of my favourite tracks from\nthe new album, sounds distinctly flat and\nempty without the vocal harmonies, and\nMy Cabal almost sounds clumsy without a synth lead.\nAfter 10 songs, the band finish with\nSempiternal/Aramanth, the longest, and\nin my opinion worst, song off their debut album Alpinisms. However, live it\nsuddenly makes sense. The track is allowed to build to a massive peak, with\nBen Curtis producing an incredible guitar feedback solo.\nAfter it\u2019s all over, I feel reassured.\nDespite my moments of doubt, this\nband are currently at their peak, and if\ntonight\u2019s performance is anything to go\nby, they really are on their way to bigger\nthings.\nSVIIB Lives on, Despite Suffering a Loss\nSVIIB teaching the masses: the dream-pop crew strut their stuff with a\nnewfound confidence despite twin sister Claudia jumping ship\nprobably a pseudonym for pop singer\nJonna Lee) who has relied on anonymity\nand fantastic production to create a collection of viral videos since December\n2009. There are 16 videos to date, sporting cryptic names and accompanied by\nhaunting, atmospheric and groundbreaking experimental songs. On a mysterious website (towhomitmayconcern.cc)\na live concert was recently announced.\nHowever, before contact could finally be\nestablished between the musicians and\nthe growing online community of fans\nthat thrive on the mystery behind the\nconcept and speculation about the over-arching plot to the videos, the YouTube\nfollowers were asked to designate an\nintermediary. User ShootUpTheStation\nwas finally chosen for his loyalty and\ndedication, and in a beautiful piece of\nmeta-fiction the latest video \u201c20101109\u201d\nshows the surreal phone call from artist\nto fan announcing that he has been cho-sen, will be picked up from his house in\nGermany and flown to Sweden in preparation for the gig.

    "content": "19\nfelix FRIDAY 12 novemBER 2010\nCOMMENT\nSteroids would improve sport\nW\nhen I was 10 years\nold I started playing Rugby. I was\nan imposing 4ft 8\u201d\n(though even that\nmight be generous). With a career as the\nnext England captain in front of me, I\nreturned to pre season training with the\nunder 11 squad for an introduction to\nfull contact. So began 6 years of big kids\nkicking the shit out of me.\nI doubt I am alone in this. You may\neven be one of these \u2018big kids\u2019 yourself.\nEven then, I\u2019m willing to bet there\u2019s\nalways been someone bigger. You see,\n\u2018big kids\u2019 are the real problem that is\nrampant in our sport today, simple genetics are what we should be taking\nurine samples for. Steven Gerrard was\ntold in the Liverpool youth academy it\nwas fine him being able to crack it at 50\nmph as a teenager, if he didn\u2019t hit 6ft he\nwas out.\nSo where does that leave us? A sporting world dominated by the best bred,\nis this something we should be standing for? Bringing in the change is easy,\nespecially when we have the answer already on the table.\nBlack Sheep\nSteroids and performance enhancing\ndrugs are already endemic in some of\nthe worlds biggest sports. The elephants\nin the room (almost literally) are the\nbody builders, but flying in at 70mph\non 2 wheels just behind them are the cy-clists. Erythropoietin (EPO) is a designer drug of today which is untraceable in\nthe system after 6 hours and makes you\ngo like Usain Bolt. To be a professional\ncyclist and abstaining from taking this\nisn\u2019t noble, or \u2018in the spirit of competition\u2019, it\u2019s mental. Everybody\u2019s doing it.\nStill, with every key stroke I hear the\nnay sayers and the yet to be converted.\n\u201cWhat about practising every day to get\ngood\u201d \u201cShouldn\u2019t take shortcuts\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s\ncheating\u201d. Allow me to now explain\nwhy I chose these complaints in particular as I succinctly answer them. I\u2019ll start\nat the end, it\u2019s only cheating whilst the\nrules make it cheating, if you change the\nrules it isn\u2019t cheating, the entire game of\nRugby I spent 6 years learning to detest\nwas only invented because some public school boy was crap at football and\ncheated, cheating can be good (that\u2019s a\nbad example of that though...).\nAs for saying you shouldn\u2019t take short\ncuts, that you should just work hard, you\nstill can. Truly, I have never grasped\nthat argument as being anything less\nthan a fundamental lack of understanding about how Steroids work. You don\u2019t\nspend 2 days just taking them, get class\nin an afternoon and sleep till Sunday.\nEven if you were 6\u2019 6\u201d and built like\na brick shit house you think you could\nplay the between-the-legs shot Roger\nFederer busts out? I didn\u2019t think so.\nI think that\u2019s the point I\u2019ve spent a\nlong winded 400 or so words trying to\nmake so far, steroids are a great leveler.\nThey let you train harder and help make\nyou a better player. Better players make\nfor better sport. I accept they are a problem whilst they remain illegal in sport.\nThe honest and rule abiding (who I am\nactually for) are punished by those who\nbreak the rules, but what better way to\ndeal with a problem that has no realistic end insight than to stop making it a\nproblem?\nAnyway, that\u2019s my dream and my\npiece on it. I\u2019m off to go put 200lbs on\nand yell at some people from speaker\u2019s\ncorner in Hyde Park about it. A very\nmuscular hand shake goodbye.\nI\ncollapsed this week, caved in and\nput Fairytale Of New York by\nThe Pogues on my iPod. It\u2019s like\nfunding an insurgency campaign\nin my mp3 player; it\u2019s not offensively Christmassy, but it\u2019s beginning to\nmake the other albums on there consider\nrising up in protest and installing a festive dictatorship.\nI think it\u2019s properly Christmas now,\nso I\u2019m tentatively preparing myself for\nsix solid weeks of red and green being\nthe only colours in existence, an entire month of balls-out, wang-flailing\ncheeriness that won\u2019t abate for a second\nuntil the crushing reality of January 1st\ndescends on us.\nI hunch myself in the corner of Starbucks at the moment, fighting some\nsort of cultural Battle of the Bulge. Up\ngoes the laptop. I arrange the leftover\n(Christmas red) paper cups in a makeshift barricade. Hunker down for the\nHun\u2019s next push, an artillery barrage of\neggnog-flavoured syrup or something.\nI\u2019m safe in the Ardennes. Can\u2019t get me\nin the Ardennes.\nThe line that gets trotted out every\nyear, that we put the decorations up too\nearly and it\u2019s too commercial, is beginning to feel slightly older than the tradition itself. As is the fact-shitting about\npagan festivals and Roman cultural\nAngry Geek\ndomination. Don\u2019t get me wrong when\nI construct an elaborate 70% post-con-sumer recycled foxhole in the nearest\ncoffee shop, I\u2019m not one of the people\nwho drones on about Christmas like it\u2019s\na sexually transmitted disease. I am all\nup on Christmas. I love this shit. I listen to Frank Sinatra belt out the same\nthree songs over and over again until my\ninternal organs start to think seriously\nabout impeaching my own brain.\nIt\u2019s just I like to ease myself into it.\nLike a hot bath. I like to dip a toe in here\nor there, gasp a little, giggle to myself\nand then slowly inch myself in. That\u2019s\nthe analogy here. What\u2019s actually happening is that one day in early November I wake up and someone chucks a full\nkettle of boiling water over my face. Not\nthe same thing. Not the same thing at all.\nAs a result, I\u2019m rationing Christmas\ncheer so that there\u2019s enough to last me\nthrough the next two months, with maybe a little left at the end to prop me up\nwhen the inevitable crushing disappointment of 2011 begins to dawn on me. The\nrules are as follows: Saturday and Sunday, Christmas all day. Mondays, Christmas from midnight to lunchtime. Then,\nstrictly no aural references to Christmas\nuntil Wednesday noon. Full-on Christmas then restarts on Friday at 4pm, at\nwhich point I blend together a mince\npie, a candy cane, four carrots and some\nwhisky and down the lot.\nThis is the way you do it. The staff in\nArgos look ready to slit their own throats\nby the start of December, because they\ndon\u2019t follow the strict A Geek Regime.\nWhat they need is a little Thunderbirdslike red button that, when pressed, flips\nover hidden panels in the wall to reveal\nflashing lights and tinsel-decorated\ntrees with little reindeers perched on\ntop, preferably live ones. Then it gives\nit a bit of purpose, a bit of pizzazz, to\nstop it from just becoming background\nnoise. Then one day, just to mix things\nup, you replace the Christmas decorations with beach furniture. Boom. Minds\nblown. Stay on your toes, consumers,\nbecause who knows what month it\u2019s going to be tomorrow. HAPPY CHINESE\nNEW YEAR. MERRY SUMMER\nSOLSTICE.\nI await Imperial to implement a similar joy-rationing scheme. Until they do,\nI will be following in the footsteps of\nBelle and Sebastian, and staging a guerilla resistance against The Pogues and\nany other form of Christmas joy. So if\nyou pass Sherfield and find yourself in\nthe middle of a hastily-organised Easter\ncelebration, don\u2019t worry. I\u2019m doing it for\nyour own good. Merry Christmas. God\nbless us, every one.\nHow the Geek stole Christmas\n\u201cI\u2019m rationing\nChristmas cheer so\nthat there\u2019s enough\nto last me through\nthe next two months\u201d\n\u201cSteroids are a great\nleveler. They let you\ntrain harder and help\nmake you a better\nplayer\u201d\nA selection of the\nreactions to last\nweek\u2019s Black Sheep\nfelixonline.co.uk\nThe subject was...\nDrugs should be legalised.\n\u201cThe \u2018just say no\u2019 mentality is\na bit dated - an ecstasy tablet\nwon\u2019t kill you, and I swear the\nmedia hype about mephed-rone turned out to be a hoax\n(i.e. mephedrone wasn\u2019t the\ncause of death).\nIf the government was really\nconcerned about safety they\u2019d\nlegalise drugs and make them\nstate run. Similar to abortions,\nfor example: before you had\nwomen being severely injured\nand killed by back-alley jobs,\nbut it didn\u2019t put anyone off,\nwhereas now they can go to a\nhospital and have it done safely (forget the cries of religious\nquacks).\u201d\nAnonymous\n\u201cSimon Jenkins recently said:\n\u201cI sometimes realise that, if\nBritain still had the death pen-alty, no current political leader\nwould have the guts to abolish\nit.\u201d\u201d\nJames Fletcher\n\u201cThe reason soft drug related\ndeaths (mdma, ketamine, can-nabis) are so low is because\ntheyre illicit hence a \u2018drugs\ncommunity\u2019 forms which looks\nafter each other and passes\non advice on dosage etc. If\nmdma were legal we would witness a surge of deaths due to\nnewbies overdosing because\nthere was no one experienced\nto look after them. Decriminalisation of possession is preferable but the current system\nworks anyway: those who want\nto get high can obtain drugs\neasily and after all, only the\nidiots get caught.\u201d\nBlack Goat\nSomething on your mind?

The six IC players were\namongst the most experienced in the Cricket\nclub and put up a spirited performance that ensured victories in all three of their matches.\nThe IC team turned up so fashionably late\nwe almost missed the first game played against\nEssex University and vice-captain Viran Parmar had to skip his mandatory Burger King\nstop. After winning the toss the Jack Black\n(or Shneebly as called by the tournament or-ganiser) look-a-like Essex Captain put IC in\nto bat. This immediately turned out to be a big\nmistake as James Musgrave scored a quick fire\n27 before retiring. Former skipper Ankit Patel\nscored a further 26 before retiring and Ahsaan\nIsmail chipped in with a further 18. James and\nAnkit returned to wreak further havoc, stretching the score to a whopping 133 after 12 overs.\nThe high quality pace attack provided by Viran\nParmar, Navin Surtani, Ankit Patel and Ahsaan\nIsmail restricted Essex 101 all out. Viran and\nNavin provided extremely tight opening spells\nwith Ahsaan and Ankit ensuring that Essex\nCricketers rock\nindoor tournament\nlike a hurricane\nwere shut completely out of the game.\nAfter a quick Subway lunch \u2013 with Musgrave\nloving his first ever footlong and Ankit spilling\nhalf of his \u2013 and a long discussion about England\u2019s Ashes chances captain Matt Tarr won the\ntoss and elected to bat once again in the second\nmatch against Kingston. All 6 of the batsmen\ncontributed to IC\u2019s total with Viran and Ankit\ngoing past 25. Defending 125, IC\u2019s bowlers got\neven better during the second match with Viran\nParmar actually bowling a maiden- an extreme\nrarity indoors. Kingston finished on 102-5 and\nthe IC team marched on to the play-offs.\nDue to the mismanagement of the tourna-ment, IC were forced to play their third and\nmost crucial game against East London, who\nincidentally knocked IC out last year, immediately after their second game. The fatigue\nbegan to show as Matt\u2019s decision to bat first\nagain began slowly. The East London bowlers\nbowled very tightly and made good use of the\nswinging ball. Fatigue showed and IC got to\na modest 103 all out thanks in large to Viran\nwith 34. IC bowlers knew they had to bowl and\nfield out of their skins; and how they did. Viran\nand Navin provided another fantastic start to\nthe innings knocking over 3 of the East London batsman in two overs. James then used his\nvariations to account for another. However, the\nruns were not entirely stopped and at just under the half way stage the score stood at 48/3.\nShortly after, Matt introduced Ahsaan and Ankit into the attack which helped to reduce the\nEast London run rate. Ultimately it all boiled\ndown to the last 3 overs of which East London\nneeded 33 runs. Ankit bowled a fantastic over\nknocking over the fifth East London batsman;\nand when this was followed by a further tight\nover by Ahsaan to put IC on the brink. IC had\nachieved victory by 21 runs and the team celebrated by going to a nearby pub where they\nwere treated to some unique karaoke by the\nEssex locals with Ahsaan chatting up a very\ndrunk Essex blonde named Denise \u2013 the only\nfailure in an otherwise successful day for the\nplayers.\nAhsaan Ismail\nIf you want to look as smart as these chaps you\u2019ll have to join the cricket club\nLast weekend, the cycling club somehow\npacked three riders and their bikes into a Ford\nFiesta and sent them off to Manchester for the\nBUCS track cycling championships. Held at\nManchester Velodrome, the home of the all-conquering British track cycling team, it was\ngoing to be a great experience, if nothing else.\nThe team consisted of experienced track cyclist\nToby Sherwood and two newcomers Iain Palmer and Iain Gillam. With Sherwood a double\nmedallist at last year\u2019s champs, gaining enough\npoints for Imperial to rank 2nd team despite\ncompeting alone, he was the main medal hope.\nHaving a team this time however meant opportunities to compete in team events such as the\nteam sprint.\nA surprise entry from Staffordshire\u2019s Dave\nReadle, a track cyclist turned mature student,\nwho has piloted tandems in international races\nfor Great Britain as well as being a regular on\nthe domestic circuit meant Sherwood was pretty much resigned to Silver medals at best.\nThe qualifying 200m time trial for the knockout match sprint competition went as expected.\nReadle posting a BUCS record of 11.171 seconds with Sherwood only able to produce an\n11.547 second ride to qualify in second spot.\nSo it looked like Readle and Sherwood were\non course for a showdown in the final and that\nwas how it progressed through the rounds with\nboth easily dispatching all opponents. The\nbest of three rides final was then Sherwood vs\nReadle with the odds heavily stacked against\nSherwood. Despite strong tactical rides from\nSherwood, managing to open up a gap between\nhimself and Readle both rides, he was ultimately overhauled by Readle\u2019s top end speed to see\nthe final settled in two rides.\nA similar result was born out in the kilometre\ntime trial. Sherwood set a personal best time of\n1.09.041 despite having to overtake the competitor riding simultaneously at the other side\nof the track. But again Readle showed his class,\nsmashing the BUCS record held by quadruple\nOlympic champion Sir Chris Hoy with a time\nof 1.06.327.\nIn the team sprint Sherwood teamed up with\nPalmer and Gillam for the 750m dash. They\ncame home in 4th with a respectable time of\n56.069. Not bad considering two of the team\nhad not ridden on a Velodrome let alone in this\ntechnical team event before.\nThe final medal opportunity for Sherwood\nwas planned to be the eight lap kieren race, featuring eight sprinters and a motorbike. Unfortunately the notoriously lax student time keeping took its toll and a slipping schedule meant\nthe event was cancelled.\nA relatively successful weekend for the team,\ngaining 20 BUCS points from the races. Unfortunately, despite gaining two more points than\nlast year, strong showings from other teams\nmeant Imperial only placed 4th in the team\ncompetition, missing out on team points.\nCyclists gain 20 BUCS points\nToby Sherwood\n\n"

The Outreach Centre, however, made it\nclear that while they thought the Volunteer\nCentre was \u2018very important\u2019, the combination of government cuts and reduced College\nfunding to the Outreach department meant\nthat they were unable to save it.\nThroughout its history, the Volunteer Centre has received various sources of government funding. Most recently the centre was\nfunded by the Teaching Enhancement and\nStudent Success scheme, TESS, offered\nby the HEFCE (Higher Education Funding\nCouncil for England) which has seen its budget cut this year. Imperial Outreach was first\nmade aware of problems with the funding\nnine months ago, but was only made aware\nof the scale of the impact of the withdrawal\nof TESS funding, two weeks ago.\nMelanie Thody, Head of the Outreach de-partment, told Felix that she had hoped that\nshe would be able to save the the Volunteer\nCentre but the reduced funding to her depart-ment, compounded by the direct withdrawal of\ngovernment funding to the Volunteer Centre\nmade it too difficult. The Outreach department\nis currently \u2018under review\u2019 by the College senior management. Melanie Thody said \u201clike\nall departments, we have to tighten our belts.\nIt\u2019s going to be tough, but other departments\nare suffering too.\u201d This term already has seen\nthe restructure of the Plant Sciences research\ngroup and the Institute of Mathematical Sciences (IMS), which was evicted from its premises at 53 Prince\u2019s Gardens. The future of the\nIMS is still uncertain as concrete plans for its\ncontinuation are yet to be released.\nProfessor Julia Buckingham, Pro Rector,\nEducation and Academic Services, dispelled\nfears that Outreach services would be affected saying, \u201cIt is vital that students with ability\nfeel there are no barriers to them coming to\nuniversity... While these are difficult times,\nthere is no question of this ethos losing its\nplace as a College priority.\u201d\nAs a result of the cuts to the Volunteer Centre, one member of staff faces the risk of re-dundancy, though it is hoped that they will be\nVolunteer Centre gutted as\nOutreach takes budget cut\nBelt-tightening continues with Outreach and Volunteer Centre the latest victims\nsuccessfully reassigned to a different part of\nthe college.\nVolunteering has always been an integral\npart of life at Imperial College London.\nWith so many diverse schemes being offered through the Outreach centre such as\n\u2018the Pimlico Connection\u2019, \u2018Exscitec\u2019, and\nmany others; it is fair to say that students and\nstaff from Imperial play an important role in\nthe wider community. Volunteering is also\nbeneficial to the volunteers. Employers are\nfinding it increasingly difficult to differentiate between candidates, so as well as gaining\nvaluable experience and learning new skills,\nstudents can use volunteering to \u2018stand out\nfrom the crowd\u2019.\nIt also has a positive impact on students well\nbeing; leading to a more enriched experience at\nuniversity. In a study done on students at various London universities including Imperial by\nthe Volunteer Centre during the academic year\n2009/2010, it was found that 56% of students\nbelieved that volunteering had increased their\n\u201csense of being part of my university\u201d, 49% of\nstudents felt that volunteering had \u201cbenefited\ntheir learning in one way or another\u201d and 89%\nof students felt volunteering \u201cincreased their\nopportunities to meet people from different\nbackgrounds\u201d.\nMinna Ruohonen, head of the Volunteer\nCentre, stressed that it was not shutting down\ncompletely, but did concede that the brokerage service which is being closed, was \u201ca lot\nof the main part\u201d of the IVC. She explained\nthat \u201cit\u2019s not a complete closure, but it\u2019s affecting our services quite dramatically, because we cannot give volunteers direct links\nto local community projects anymore\u201d.\nMembers of the college will still be able to\naccess schemes such as \u2018IntoUniversity\u2019 and\n\u2018CV2012\u2019, though the majority of the opportunities which the Volunteer Centre offered\nare now gone.\nThe closure of the service is something that\nRuohonen personally finds very emotional.\nShe expressed her sadness at the closure of the\ncentre because \u201cit has been a closure that has\nreally hurt my heart, in that the centre has been\nsomething that I personally set up, developed,\nand was something that I was really passionate\nabout, and I was seeing that it actually served\na purpose.\u201d She added that \u201cFor me and the\nwhole of Outreach, it has been quite painful\njourney to actually close the brokerage service\nand go through further redundancy, but I personally hope that people will use the remaining parts of the Volunteer Centre, and continue\nvolunteering one way or another.\u201d\nAs part of the brokerage service the Volunteer Centre provided an online search engine\nthat volunteers could use to search and apply\nfor volunteering opportunities. With options\nto filter projects by preferences, time commit-ment, skills, and over 100 projects to search\nfrom since it was last updated; the brokerage\nservice had been an invaluable part of volunteering at Imperial. This is especially true for\ninternational students who have just arrived in\nthe UK and know little about the infrastructure and necessary steps needed to start volunteering in the UK. The service will continue\nto be available until the 22nd of November.\nThe College expressed its regret at the loss\nof the Volunteer Centre\u2019s brokerage service\nbut said that it was forced to review its activities as a result of the \u201csignificant financial\nchallenges which are having a direct impact\non every university in England.\u201d\nRuohonen highlighted the effects that the\nclosure will have on volunteers who are international student, explaining \u201cI think it will\nnow be much more difficult for international\nstudents to find those projects, especially in\ntheir first year. I believe this will directly\ninfluence their student experience and their\nwhole studying experience, because if you\nhave a lot of extra-curricular activities, and\nenjoy it as well, it then affects your studies,\nbecause you are happy.\u201d International student\nNina Hartwich, explained that \u201cthe service\nprovided by the Volunteer Centre was very\nuseful and helped me to start volunteering in\na country and city that was new for me.\u201d\nStudents and staff across Imperial will be\ndeeply affected by the closure. Deputy President Heather Jones said \u201cwe won\u2019t be able to\nplug the gap [left by the Volunteer Centre].\nOur students are highly skilled and it\u2019s very\nsad for students and volunteer organisations\nthat they won\u2019t be able to volunteer those\nskills like before\u201d. With the Volunteer Centre prophesising that \u201cit is going to be more\ndifficult for volunteers to find volunteering\nopportunities\u201d, it is clear that the number of\nvolunteers will dwindle.\nA College spokersperson said that they are\n\u201cexploring alternative ways for partners to\naccess those staff and students who wish to\nvolunteer with community organisations,\u201d\nand recommended the Volunteer Centre\nWestminster http://www.volunteer.co.uk/\nand the Volunteer Centre Chelsea and Kensington. They went on to say, \u201cthe College remains committed to supporting volunteering\nas a matter of policy, with almost 250 staff\nand students currently registered as volunteers who are actively volunteering their time\nthis academic year\u201d.\nThe Volunteer Centre is not the first victim\nof the fiscal contraction going on at Imperial.\nThis year alone the Life Sciences department\nhave had to make difficult decisions and the\nInstitute of Mathematical Sciences faces an\nuncertain future after being booted from their\nbuilding. In recent years we have also seen\nthe closure of some of the Humanities Department\u2019s services. It is obvious that we will\nsee similar closures and departments \u2018under\nreview\u2019 in the coming academic year.\nThe cuts so far\nLife Sciences\nThe Life Sciences department instigated a restructure that saw several units, including Plant Sciences,\nmerged into one Integrative Cell\nBiology unit. The Union launched a\ncampaign to stop what they termed\nthe \u201cend of Plant Sciences\u201d at Imperial, which the department de-nied. It is not yet known what the\nfull impact of the restructure will be.\nInstitute of\nMathematical Sciences\nThe Institute of Mathematical Sciences, like the Life Sciences department is being \u2018restructured\u2019. It\nhas been removed from its premises at 53 Prince\u2019s Gardens but no\nalternative model for its continuation has been released yet.\nIan Wei\nKatherine Bettany\n...Continued from Front Page\nMinna Ruohonen, head of the Volunteer Centre, said \u201cit has\nbeen quite a painful journey to close the brokerage service\u201d\n\n"

    "content": "12 felix\nFRIDAY 12 november 2010\nTECHNOLOGY\nTechnology Editor: Samuel Gibbs\ntechnology.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nThe first mention of a mythical PlayStation phone was over four years ago\nin September 2006 on several gadget\nrumour websites. Recently Engadget,\narguably the largest gadget blog in the\nworld, has staked their reputation on the\nfact that the fabled device exists -- sharing specifications and a series of photographs of an Android based smartphone\nwith a custom Sony Marketplace for\ngames. When Engadget says something\nexists, it definitely exists.\nSony\u2019s attempt at bridging the gap\nbetween a games console and a phone\nappears to be a direct response to the\nhandheld gaming threat posed by the\niPhone, and to an extent the iPod touch,\nwith the touch screen interface, acceler-ometer gaming controls and wide range\nof cheap downloadable games in the\nApp Store.\nNow the Playstation phone appears to\nbe real, with Sony Computer Entertainment Europe quickly retracting a statement by an employee that the phone is\na \u2018fake\u2019 and instead stating that they \u2018do\nnot comment on speculation\u2019.\nThe rumours predict a 1GHz proces-sor, 512MB of RAM, 1GB of ROM,\na 3.7\u201d-4.1\u201d screen size and perhaps\nmost surprisingly, a MicroSD card slot\nin lieu of its proprietary and more expensive M2 or MemoryStick Duo slot.\nPrices are not known, although it can\nbe expected to undercut the iPhone\nand compete with existing Android\nsmartphones.\nThe phone will likely be available in\nthe first half of 2011. This is of course\nall rumour at the moment, until it is officially announced and in the hands of\nreviewers everywhere!\nIt\u2019s no secret thatApple isn\u2019t the biggest fan\nof Adobe\u2019s Flash. One of the big criticisms\nof the iPhone is its inability to display Flash\ncontent, which upon the device\u2019s release,\nmade up a huge portion of the internet\u2019s\nstreaming videos and games.\nThis inspired Steve Jobs to write an open\nletter back in April, criticising the technology on multiple fronts, including: openness,\nsize, reliability, power consumption and de-velopment. One can only assume that lost\nsomewhere in the first draft of this letter\nwas a reference to Flash\u2019s mother, possibly\nlinked to some remark about obesity, perhaps having her own postcode.\nAs well as irritating Adobe, whose CEO\nShantanu Narayen later announced the\ncompany had \u201cmoved on\u201d from iOS de-velopment, it extinguished any hope left\nin iPhone owners that they will ever get to\nwatch Megavideo or play Miniclip games\non their pocket pal of choice.\nThen along came Skyfire, an alternative mobile browser choice with a twist,\npreviously only available on the Android\nplatform. Skyfire\u2019s brand new iOS app\nfinally brought Flash video to the iPhone\n(without having to go the jailbreak route).\nThis feat of Apple defiance is achieved by\ntranscoding the video into Apple-friendly\nHTML5 wrapped H.264 on their own serv-ers, before streaming it to users. On top\nof this killer feature is a fully functioning\nmobile browser built on top of the Webkit\nunderpinnings that powers Mobile Safari,\nmaintaining most of the capabilities seen in\nthe built-in iOS browser, but adding things\nlike: private browsing (porn mode, if you\nwill), a related pages explorer and fast access to Facebook.\nAs one can imagine, it has been a huge\nsuccess. Just hours after its US release the\napp shot to number one in the iTunes app\ncharts and had to be pulled by Skyfire as\ntheir servers were crippled by the sudden\nonset of iPhone users. Early downloaders\nwho have given it a try seem to be happy\nwith the product. Flash is a bit slow to load\nas the servers do their converting, but the\ncontent is delivered with a decent quality.\nOne drawback is that the HTML5 video returned to the user does not allow scrolling\nto a specific point in time in the video, nor\ncan it implement the \u201cskip ad\u201d features that\nsome sites offer.\nIt\u2019s also important to note that this technology does not work with Flash games, so\nprocrastinating in lectures will still be best\ndone with apps or laptops.\nAt the time of writing, the app remains\npulled from the app store, but will slowly be re-released in the US to be sold in\n\u2018batches\u2019 and expanded globally as Skyfire reinforces their servers to deal with us\ndemanding iPhone users. While it\u2019s not in\nApple\u2019s nature to change their principles\nwhen it comes to user-interface and how\nthat interacts with features, this app makes\none thing tremendously clear: iOS users\nwant Flash!\nFree App of the Week\niOS - Sky Sports News for iPhone\nWhatever sport you follow, Sky Sports News has you\ncovered.

    "content": "CLUBS & SOCIETIES\nFELIX\n42\nT\nwo weeks after a very well\nattended Freshers trip, two\nminibuses of Outdoor Club\nmembers left for a weekend of adventure in the\nrenowned Peak District National Park.\nDespite taking wildly different routes,\nboth groups arrived at Fulwood Scout\nHut, Sheffield within seconds of each\nother, after sampling some of the Midlands cheapest, and perhaps greasiest,\ntakeaway food (in Loughborough and\nBirmingham). The occupants of both\nvehicles were of course disappointed in\ntwo ways: 1. They hadn\u2019t got there first\n2. Worst of all, no one had yet brewed\nup. After quickly unloading the buses\nthe latter of these grievances was rapidly\nremedied before all settled in for a very\ncomfortable sleep.\nEarly on Saturday a motivated group\nof walkers and climbers, spurred by the\nexcellent weather, were up and packing\nthe kit needed for the day ahead. The\nfirst bus made it\u2019s way to Stanage High\nNeb, at the Western end of the extensive\ngritstone escarpment of Stanage Edge,\nwhilst the second bus beelined for Stanage Popular, the opposite end of this\n3-mile long rock feature. Stanage is a\nmagical place for climbers, walkers, fell\nrunners and mountain bikers alike. The\nrough, dark grey rock sits above auburn\nbracken, punctuated by bright green,\ngrassy paths and large, round millstones\nshaped from what some describe as\n\u2018God\u2019s own rock\u2019. The top of the edge\nstretches out into vast moorland and\nstanding above the climbs you are rewarded with views of nearby Hathersage, the picturesque Edale and Hope\nvalleys and of course the other gritstone\nedges. Invigorated by the splendour of\nthe natural environment and the cool\nmorning air all were eager to have a go\nat climbing the famous cracks, aretes,\nnebs and rugosities and before long\nwe\u2019d Limbo\u2019ed, Tango\u2019ed, accessed the\nInaccessible Crack (Direct) and some\nhad even taken to flight on Flying Buttress Direct. However, like Stanage, the\nOutdoor Club is about much more than\njust climbing, and many of the trip members opted to brave the windy conditions\nof the moor to walk, or in one case run,\nalong the length of the edge, exploring\nthe different scenery and features, including the famous Robin Hood\u2019s Cave\n- a popular summer bivouac.\nOf course, the most important part of\nany trip is the Saturday evening, when\neveryone can come together and share\nstories of the day. A few members had\ndressed for Halloween so our number\nincluded a superhero, Rod Stewart\u2019s\nlove-child and a reptile charming wiz-ard. Now, with the chilli simmering, a\nfew cans drunk and the pumpkin carved\nit was time to begin the games, starting\nwith the traditional family favourite:\nApple, Carrot and other assorted vegetable bobbing. The rules are simple: 3 tries\nthen you\u2019re out. You eat what you \u2018win\u2019\nor losers drink a cup of the bobbing\n\u2018juice\u2019 - a bright red foaming concoction\nnot dissimilar to snakebite. The competency level was high this year, with\nRAG Week\nCGCU Slave Auction\nAmateur Radio\nPlease contact Phil (pjh@talk21.com) if\nyou have any interest in amateur radio\n(ham radio). Staff and students wanted!\nNOTICE\nFriday 12 November 2010\nmany people succeeding on apples or\nbananas, and only a few unlcuky souls\nretrieving onions, or nothing at all. Now\nwith a good hunger we sat down to tuck\ninto copious volumes of pasta and chilli,\nfollowed by chocolate cake and custard.\nThe perfect meal after a long day. As\nwe all relaxed with some after dinner\ndrinks, no one (including the performer)\nrealised that an impromptu Karaoke and\ndance-a-thon session was about to be-gin. Needless to say, they were slightly\nembarrassed the next morning and the\nauthor of this report has it on good\ngrounds that they are desperately seeking to destroy the video evidence.\nSo, enjoying the extra hour of sleep,\nand the obligatory Sunday morning lie\nin it was a slower start to our second\nday in the Peak. The bright sunshine and\ncrisp breeze of Saturday had been replaced with an atmospheric mist across\nthe higher moors and slightly warmer\ntemperatures. Three parties set out. One\nto undertake a good 20km walk via Win\nHill, a small grassy Peak which quietly\nmocks the neighbouring Lose Hill, and\nLadybower reservoir - training ground\nof the \u2018Dambusters\u2019. Two sites of interesting and unrelated military history.\nMeanwhile, others climbed at Bamford\nand Froggatt edges - giving club members the chance to practise their lead\nclimbing skills on some fairly challenging routes. An unexpected rendezvous\nof two of these teams in the Yorkshire\nBridge Inn gave an opportunity for more\ntale telling before heading back to the\nbuses to make the long drive home.\nEven more remarkably than the outward\njourney, the two buses left different\nparts of Derbyshire, at different times,\nreturned to London by different routes\nand arrived back at Beit about one minute apart. Some things are just meant to\nbe!\nIn a weekend in which, Burg dressed\nas a non-mammalian Batman character,\nJonny reintroduced the mullet to the\nclimbing scene, Phil wore a snake as a\nscarf and many people wore a purple\npointy wizards hat all but the longest\nserving members of the club will be\nsurprised to hear that nobody wore a flat\ncap!\nThe Outdoor Club has been active since 1945. Typically, weekend\ntrips see members walking, climb-ing, running, rafting and biking their\nway through the hills. The club also\nclimbs indoors at Ethos from 7pm-9pm every Thursday evening during\nterm-time.

    "content": "29\nfelix\nFILM\nRemember when you were little and you made imaginary films of all your toys? This is it\nFriday 12 November 2010\nHaving just watched A Town Called\nPanic, I am employing every ounce of\nself-control and the limited reserve of\ndignity in my body and mind to prevent\nmyself from writing this review in full\ncaps-lock. Words alone cannot describe\nhow much I enjoyed this film. Guttural\nnoises would hardly do it justice either.\nIf you only take one thing from this re-view, if not even this whole newspaper\nthis year, it is that you should see this\nfilm.\nThe easiest way to describe it would\nbe quirky, however \u201cquirky\u201d is a term\nbandied about a lot, and never in a good\nway. Quirky is like Cute\u2019s ugly cousin.\nIf someone has a quirky fashion sense,\nfor example, it means they know that\nindividualism is the key, but take it too\nfar. I mean we all go to Topshop and\nsee that one item of clothing and think\n\u201cah man that\u2019s an awesome shoulder\npadded leopard print blazer with an appliqu\u00e9 pattern of Pol-pot\u2019s face on the\nlapel\u201d try it on and think, \u201cah man this\nis hilarious but no, I\u2019m not in a La Roux\nvideo\u201d and then put it back. The next\nday however we, the quirk-deficient\nmasses, will be walking into college\nand see said quirky person walking it,\nnot only in the blazer but with a pair\nof knee high maroon Doc martens and\nsome skinnies they found in a skip in\nDalston. Quirky, in other words is: Shit,\nbut endearingly earnest.\nA Town Called Panic on the other hand\nis not like that. It is certainly not shit \u2013 it\nis incredible \u2013 and although endearing\nto beyond levels never seen before in a\nfilm, it does so with the cool understated\nlack of earnestness that exemplifies its\nbreathtaking sense of simple, unadulterated fun. That said, its quirkiness stems\nfrom taking concepts, in this case ostensibly for family entertainment, and\nelevating them to new heights. Basic\ncharacters, easy to understand scenarios,\ncomedy violence and bright colourful\nvisuals are all here in joyously overblown proportions.\nOriginating from a Belgian kids TV\nseries launched in 2000 with the same\nname, A Town Called Panic invented the\ncreative themes that are instantly recognisable to British television viewers as\nthe Cravendale Milk adverts, produced\nby the same guys. Although this is so\nmuch more than just \u201cCravendale-Le\nMovie,\u201d all the most arresting themes\nare here: the plastic toys; painstaking\nand impressive stop motion anima-tion; dialogue at nothing less than a full\nthroated shout (though being in French\nadds a softer and certainly more comedic effect) and, although the successive\nscenarios are so non-sequitur as to make\nMonty Python look like Jane Austen, the\nnarrative has a fluidity that never lets the\npace falter. It would be customary now\nto attempt to give a brief introduction\nto the plot, but when the plot involves\na Horse as a sort of father figure to a\ncowboy and indian, in love with a piano\nteacher and living in a village with an\nalcoholic farmer called Steven with a\nstory line revolving around what happens when cowboy and indian try to\norganise a surprise for horse, it quickly\nbecomes pointless trying. Anyway I was\nlaughing too hard throughout most of it\nto remember.\nComing in at under 90 minutes, this\npint sized puppet film had me roaring\nwith laughter and cheering it on. Remarkably for an animated children\u2019s\nfilm it had a slot in the Official Selection at Cannes Film festival. It is out on\nDVD on Monday the 15th of November\nand comes with my whole hearted rec-ommendation. A joy.\nDirector & Screenwriter St\u00e9phane\nAubier, Vincent Patar\nCast St\u00e9phane Aubier, Jeanne\nBalibar and Nicolas Buysse\nA Town Called Panic\nMatt Allinson\nWhat can be so interesting about an old\nbut loving married couple who could not\nbe happier with their lives? According to\nMike Leigh, the director of one of this\nyear\u2019s best films, quite a lot. In a film that\nis separated over one year, it\u2019s the people\naround them that present all the complex\nemotional problems with the four seasons bringing about four unique episodes\nof supporting characters with their own\nstruggles. For Tom (Jim Broadbent) and\nGerri (Ruth Sheen), the blissfully married couple, the coming year is just \u201cAnother Year,\u201d but a year can bring out so\nmuch pain in others, pain that they have\nto acknowledge and deal with.\nFulfilling jobs, soothing hobbies, stable home, healthy conversations, great\nmeals are what make up Tom and Gerri\u2019s\nsuccessful marriage. But just because\nthey\u2019re living the picture-perfect life, it\ndoesn\u2019t mean their friends are. Take Gerri\u2019s colleague Mary (Lesley Manville)\nfor example; after a string of unsuccessful relationships including failed mar-riages, she is lonely, and knocking back\nglasses of wine - a common occurrence\nfor her sad existence. She has not given\nup hope, and is convinced that men are\nstill interested in her. She eventually sets\nher eyes on Tom and Gerri\u2019s only son Joe\n(Oliver Maltman), and is quite naturally\nbitter and devastated when he brings\naround a young, attractive, perky fianc\u00e9e\n(Karina Fernandez) home one day.\nMany of the events seen in Another\nYear seem uninteresting; a male/fe-male friend visiting for dinner, a son\nvisiting for a few days, a funeral etc\u2026\nbut Leigh makes sure that every single\nevent means something significant and\nwith the film\u2019s central theme of compa-ny, loneliness, depression and happiness\neach seasonal episode is there to bring\nabout new revelations and new characters that make a significant impact on\nthe general flow of the film\u2019s narrative.\nNo matter how annoying or inappropriate their friends may be, Tom and\nGerri tolerate them with all their heart.\nMary goes on and on (always with a\nlarge glass of wine in one of her hands,\nof course) about the most insignificant\ndetails of her life. She gets chattier and\nmakes less sense when drunk, and it\u2019s\nobvious she gets sloshed every night on\nwine. Her rambling is hysterical at first,\nbut as she continues, the audience is given enough time and invasive close-up\nshots to realise just how hopeless she is.\nManville gives the best performance in a\nfilm full of outstanding ones. She brings\nout enough humour from her character\nbut every facial expression on her face\nreminds us of something more depressing and desperate. She may not be a\nlikable character, but is someone you\ncan feel sympathy for. Manville magically transforms this otherwise hateful\nspinster into a victim of chronic loneli-ness. The film\u2019s final moment is focused\nsolely on Manville and no one else. With\nno music or dialogue, Manville alone is\nperfectly able to portray the fear and\nworry for the tragedy that awaits her.\nRich with low-key, subtle, hugely effective comedy as well as some heart-wrenching drama, Another Year is one\nof Leigh\u2019s finest works of his career.\nThe title and general tone of the film\nmay be off-putting for some for being\n\u201ctoo British;\u201d and yes, this is as British\nas they come, but it\u2019s simply outstanding\nbecause of it.\nDirector & writer Mike Leigh\nCast Jim Broadbent, Ruth Sheen\nand Lesley Manville\nAnother Year\nJohn Park\nDirector Ridley Scott\nScreenwriter Hampton Fancher\nCast Harrison Ford, Rutger Hauer\nand Sean Young\nBlade Runner\nJames Goldsack\nOn BBC iPlayer until midnight tomorrow (Saturday 13th), is the best film you\ncan see for free this weekend.

    "content": "SPORT\n45\nfelix FRIDAY 12 NOVEMBER 2010\ntop with Southampton, with Nottingham\njust a point behind as the race for the cup\nwas reduced to a three team battle.\nDressed up as a 13 man Asian baseball team, we returned to the Herts field\non Halloween for our final round robin\ngame against reigning Fall Cup champions University of East Anglia. With\nNottingham having already defeated\nSouthampton for a place in the final earlier that day, the Falcons needed a point\nto ensure qualification. Another late\ncomeback by the Falcons saw us take a\n3-2 lead, and Imperial hung on for a 3-3\ntie and the necessary point to play for\nthe Fall Cup.\nTied with the Thieves, Imperial was\ntop of the table by virtue of our head\nto head record over Nottingham. Thus,\nImperial had the advantage of batting\nin the bottom half of the inning in the\nfinal. While the opponent was the same\nas our first match, the game was not the\npitching duel of Saturday and instead it\nbecame a battle of lineups. A great fly-ball catch with men on 1st and 2nd base\nby Kevin Ling slowing the bats of the\nThieves. However, good base running\nby Nottingham allowed them to take the\nlead with the score 2-0 at the top of the\nfirst inning. Multiple lead changes saw\nthe Falcons trailing 6-4 with two innings\nremaining. Hanson came out of the bullpen to shut the Thieves down, giving\nImperial a chance to pull the game back.\nThe Falcons so nearly tied it, scoring\nonce but aggressive base running left\nJun Weng, the tying run, thrown out at\nthe plate for the 3rd out. With that, the\nFalcons were down one with just one\ninning to play at 6-5. A quick three-up,\nthree-down defensive top half of the inning set up the Falcons last shot at glory,\nas the team needed to manufacture one\nrun to stay alive, and two runs to walk\noff winners. Rory Thomas followed up\na big hit with great slide to break up a\ndouble play. Syed Taha chased this up\nwith a walk to load the bases. Finally,\nall tension was relieved as a single by\nVassil drove in Kevin as the winning run\nand a mad celebratory scramble ensued.\nThe weekend saw some great baseball\nplayed by all sides. The Falcons, a team\nclearly more than the sum of its parts,\nshowed great spirit, repeatedly scoring vital runs and making great defensive plays to end games and ultimately\nearned its first national title. After overcoming the daze of too much champagne sipped from the trophy, we now\nshift our focus to retaining our Southern league championship with matches\nagainst Oxford, Southampton and ULJS\ncoming up in November.\nBaseball Club win the Falcon\nCup for the first time\nThe Falcons with the Fall Cup.

Unfortunately the Immortals defence were unable to halt the\nStingers passing game and Surrey recaptured the lead before the half adding a\ntwo-point conversion.\nAfter the break the Stingers extended\ntheir lead as they took advantage of an\noffensive fumble and scored another\npassing touchdown to make the score\n8-20. Down by 12 points the Immortals\noffence dug deep and engineered a 35\nyard drive to score. Good blocking by\nthe offensive line led by rookie centre\nZhiyao \u201cJackson\u201d Xing and a first career\nreception for wide receiver Charles Edwards of 15 yards, set up first-year running back Alistair Boyce for his maiden\nrushing touchdown. Back in the game\nat 14-20, the Immortals defence set\nabout countering the continued aerial\nassault as the Stingers completely abandoned the running game and attempted\nto pick apart the defensive secondary. A\ndecent pass-rush from the Immortals defensive line and linebacking corp gave\nthe Surrey Quarterback little time to\nmake his throws and Cornerback Irfan\nRaza and Safety Arjav Trivedi were able\nto break up plays and almost picked the\nball for multiple interceptions.\nWith time running down the offence\nonce more handed the ball off to Millar\nand solid blocking sprung the running\nback for a 34 yard touchdown run, levelling the score. A failed two-point conversion meant the game would be heading for overtime.\nGetting the ball first, the Immortals\ndrove from the 25 yard line and despite\nsolid play by the Stingers\u2019 now tiring\ndefence, Quarterback Rob Wolstenholme threw a beautiful spiral pass to\nArjav Trivedi for a 25 yard, career-first,\ntouchdown. Failing on the two point\nconversion the Immortals led 26-20.\nSurrey commenced their drive and the\ndefence almost won the game, only for\nthe Stingers to score on 4th down, but\nfailing to convert the two-point conver-sion. Receiving another drive each, the\nImmortals failed to score as Millar was\nstopped inches short of the goalline on\n4th down.

Arriving somewhat early, there was plenty of\ntime for the ladies to psych themselves\nup against a team who, it appeared, had\nnot only a full-time coach, but also a\nseparate warm-up coach!\nOn a pitch more reminiscent of a\nsoggy beach than an Astroturf, a winning toss forced the opposition to play\ninto the sun, and Imperial tried to take\nfull advantage. Having learned from the\nprevious game that the Holloway players could only follow their coach\u2019s in-structions, Imperial put up a much better\nfight, forcing much of the play into the\nopposition half. Unfortunately, thanks\nto some solid last-gasp defence, and a\nlucky penalty corner strike, Royal Holloway were first to score. With some\nhelp from (flexi-)Harry\u2019s acrobatics in\nthe D, and helped by the opposition defence\u2019s inability to keep up with Teddy,\nIC brought it back to 1-1 for half time.\nReady for the second half, and aware\nthat full-time at 1-1 would only mean\ngolden-goals and penalty flicks (an experience far too stressful to contemplate),\nImperial Ladies finally took advantage\nof one of their many penalty-corners;\na great shot from Gigi \u201cI can\u2019t score\u201d\nFateh-Iravani taking it them 2-1 ahead.\nThe Holloway girls unfortunately failed\nto be boosted by their coach\u2019s words of\nwisdom (such inspirational words as\n\u201cthat\u2019s not how we play hockey, is it\ngirls?\u201d were to be heard from the side-line), and Imperial dominated the rest of\nthe second half, with Kirsten finishing\noff a cross to take the final score to 3-1.\nWith only two more matches against\nRoyal Holloway before the end of the\nseason, IC Ladies move on to the second\nround of the ULU Cup \u2013 preparing for\nthe next tie against GKT Ladies\u2019 1s.\nJess Poore\nWomen\u2019s Hockey ULU CUP\nIC 1st 3 - 1 Royal Holloway 1st\nHockey: Ladies\n1s\u2019 progress in\nULU Cup\n\n"

I actually have\na vital role in the running of our\ncountry\nCameron_DA_Maneron!!!\nhahahaha\nI\nt\u2019s been a week of pain for me:\nPhysical pain, mental pain and\nthe unbearable cringe-worthy\npain of listening to \u2018Felix radio\u2019.\nIt\u2019s like having an audio supplement to my electricity bill. I know\nyou\u2019re, by now, well-accustomed to my\nbitter nature, but this week has been a\nparticularly infuriating one, and has left\nme even more venomous than usual.\nIt all began with the fireworks... ( Cue\nflahshback with dreamy flashback mu-sic. Du lu lu lu lu luuu)\nSaturday 6th November\nBonfire night. An annual celebration\nof failure. Guy Fawkes sets out to assassinate the king and ends up dead, leaving the king very much unassassinated.\nWe\u2019re celebrating something that didn\u2019t\nhappen. It\u2019s like having a birthday party\nfor an aborted foetus. (Oh get over it! At\nleast I haven\u2019t actually aborted a foetus).\nDickens didn\u2019t write \u2018A Bonfire Carol\u2019,\nbut if he did, I\u2019d definitely be the detestable protagonist. I\u2019m the scrooge of\nBonfire night, and no stupid ghost is going to persuade me to change my ways.\nUnless they were willing to perhaps occasionally write my Hangman article.\nThey could be my (Teehee) Ghost writ-ers. (Oh get over it! At least it wasn\u2019t an\nabortion joke)\nI hate everything about Bonfire night:\nthe bonfire, the fireworks and the peo-ple. Why does everyone suddenly think\nthey\u2019re my friend now that we\u2019re all\nat the Bonfire night together? It\u2019s that\nnauseous sense of \u2018family atmosphere\u2019.\nFamilies ruin everything. A family event\nbecomes a family warzone with every\nfamily trying to out-family the other\nfamily. You really think that the Dad has\nput his daughter on his shoulders to give\nher a better view of the bonfire? No! He\nsimply has the height advantage now\nfor a one-on-one. It\u2019s a show of power.\nWhen a mum gives her child a sparkler\nand puts him in the fenced-off \u2018safety\nzone\u2019, do you think she wants him to\nhave fun? Of course not! She just wants\nhim to look cute and adorable. Do you\never see an ugly kid with a sparkler? No!\nOf course not! Ugly kids are left in the\ncar because they\u2019re a fucking disgrace to\nthe family.\nChrist, I haven\u2019t even started on the\nfireworks. My friend dragged me along\nthis year, insisting that I\u2019d enjoy the display (just like those fucking ghosts). He\nwas wrong. Call me a sophisticated human being, but pretty colours and noises\njust don\u2019t excite me \u2013 couldn\u2019t believe\nI\u2019d missed X factor for this. And why\ndoes everyone have to go \u2018ooooooh\u2019 and\n\u2018aaaaaaahhh\u2019 like amateur porn stars\nfaking an orgasm? And for every single\nfucking firework!? I felt like I was attending some pagan ritual. For a horrible\nsecond I thought they might sacrifice the\nchildren to the gods and throw them on\nthe bonfire. I guess if they did the ugly\nones, it wouldn\u2019t have been such a bad\nthing.\nUntil I see a firework embody the\nshape of a dragon and descend upon a\nstartled crowd then fireworks will always just be stupid flashy bang colours.\nGod Bless you Gandalf.\nBonfire night was just a minor nuisance this week, however. A simple\nmistake I will never make again! When\nI was talking about physical pain earlier,\nI wasn\u2019t lying. I\u2019ve been an invalid for\nthe last four days, on a cocktail of painkillers and antibiotics just for a fucking\ntoothache!\nLet me tell you that time flies when\nyou\u2019re either screaming with agony into\na pillow (neighbours called the police on\nthe first night, presumably because they\nthought I was being raped, so thought I\nshould muffle my cries the next time),\nor unconscious-verging-comatose from\ntaking so many opiate-based painkillers.\nI have an abscess on the root of my tooth\nand it feels like someone is repeatedly\nhacking away at my jaw with a blunt\naxe, rubbing it with salt and then pissing on it with acid. I don\u2019t even know if\nit\u2019s possible to piss acid, but I definitely\nknow what it\u2019s like to be pissed on with\nacid. Of course, with a full-time schedule of screaming, sleeping and mildly\nhallucinating, I didn\u2019t find much time\nto tell Kadhim that I may not be able to\nwrite anything for Hangman this week.\nAnd so that\u2019s why, at 5.30 in the morning of the day that this issue of Felix\nis sent to the printers, I\u2019m just ranting\nabout fireworks and toothaches. Well,\nwhilst I\u2019m here and pissed off I might\nas well mention the Asylum seekers that\nhave been left untouched for the last few\nweeks. Yeah, that\u2019s right I\u2019m talking\nabout you Drunken Mate of the week\nand Horoscopes! What happened to\nCoffee Break huh? Come crawling over\nto my section and think I won\u2019t even no-tice!? Think you can take advantage of\na guy with toothache? You\u2019re sick! God\ndamn, if McPickle hadn\u2019t rescued my\ndick from that beehive whilst I was licking AIDS from a cat, then I\u2019d send you\nback to that lesser-shithole you came\nfrom! THIS ISN\u2019T OVER! THIS ISN\u2019T\nOVVVEEEERRRRRR!!!\nIt\u2019s totally over, there\u2019s nothing I can\ndo about it.\nHangman pisses on\nhis own bonfire\nOr is it \u2018her\u2019own bonfire? Eh, eh? ...\nOh yah, so like fire is so representative of like... emotion yah. *choke... oh gawd, hold on,\nyah I think my own intestine is coming up to strangle me\nRead Hangman\nonline at www.\nasifwewouldu-ploadthis.com.\nPsyche!

    "content": "FELIX Friday 12 november 2010 33\nGAMES\n\u201c\n\u201cMotion and sound-sensitive\ncontrollers cannot possibly\nhope to match the precision of\nthe traditional controller or the\nmouse and keyboard\u201d\nn gaming has arrived\nThe last time I played a wrestling game was in\n1998 on the original PlayStation 1. WWF Warzone was the first 3D wrestling game ever, and\nalthough I had no particular interest in wrestling it was a title I came back to every so of-ten. So, twelve years on, how much have things\nchanged?\nOn the surface, gameplay remains basically\nthe same. Matches consist of two or more wrestlers clotheslining, chokeslamming and DDTing each other into submission. There is a new\ncontrol scheme, and of course there is a myriad\nof new characters, moves, and features, but the\ncore of the wrestling is (not surprisingly) very\nfamilliar.\nCombo moves are still a put off. You can still\nperform grabs, locks and various other pain-inducing movements, but figuring out which\nbuttons you need to press is the real chal-lenge. This is really frustrating as I know what\nmoves I want to do but I just can\u2019t remember\nthe button combinations for them. I\u2019m sure\nthis is part of the challenge for hardcore players but punching someone in the face repeatedly gets tiresome when you know there\u2019s\nmore interesting stuff you could be doing.\nThe content creation options have been massively expanded with new ways to customise\nthe game to the player\u2019s liking. Almost everything is customisable: audience signs, entrance\ndisplays and even story arcs. The character creator is actually incredibly advanced and rivals\nthat of The Sims series in the amount of options\nit has. It does, however, seem a little unhinged:\nwe managed to create a shiny pink monstrosity with two metre long arms and a protrusion\nfrom his belly that was very reminiscent of\nsomething from Alien.\nThe best part about wrestling games is playing with friends, as you essentially get to beat\neach other up without anyone getting hurt.\nLocal multiplayer is available and is actually\npretty amusing, but playing multiplayer online is incredibly slow. There\u2019s no control over\nplayers who haven\u2019t picked a character yet so\neveryone has to sit around waiting for idlers.\nWhen I tried a game in \u2018Royal Rumble\u2019mode, I\ngot 30 seconds of wrestling for approximately\nhalf an hour wait. I literally sat there watching\nother people wrestle for about ten minutes.\nOverall, WWE Smackdown Vs. Raw 2011 is\nnot a bad game. There really is a lot of content on offer here if you\u2019re interested, so if you\nlike wrestling then you definitely should buy\nthis game. For everyone else though, the old\nproblem is still present: this is a game about\nwrestling, designed by wrestlers for people\nwho like wrestling. Sure, fighting your friends\ncan be amusing for a while, but if you\u2019re someone who has no particular interest in wrestling\nit\u2019s hard to really see what Smackdown Vs. Raw\n2011 can offer you.\nderstand how vital it is to your studies that they\ninvest in a Kinect.\nGame wise Kinect is lacking, but then again\nmost new consoles are a bit shabby in the\ngame department upon initial release. It\u2019s just\na question as to whether or not the Kinect\u2019ll go\ndown the PS3 route and have nothing decent to\noffer us four years or so down the line. There\nhave been a dozen or so games released so far,\nmostly sport and dancing stuff that make full\nuse of the Kinect\u2019s motion sensor. They\u2019ve received mixed reviews, ranging from fun and\nentertaining to hair pullingly frustrating (I\u2019m\nlooking at you again Sonic). They\u2019ll keep you\nentertained for a good few hours but don\u2019t expect them to last you for weeks. Maybe the\ngame industry will prove me wrong but expect\nthere to be a lot of rehashed iterations of the\nsame themes.\nOf course, some guy has already managed\nto destroy his LCD TV by swinging a ceiling\nfan\u2019s chain right into the screen whilst flinging\nhis arms about like an idiot. Still, that\u2019s more a\nfault of him being a nitwit than anything the Kinect did. I\u2019m sure most people have heard those\nstories of Wii remotes flying into tellies, though\nin many of those cases airborne remotes were a\nresult of faulty straps. Let it serve as a warning,\nmind \u2013 if you do end up buying a Kinect or any\nother motion sensitive controller, watch where\nyou fling your limbs.\nThere\u2019s also been a bit of controversy and a\n$2000 prize generated by the Kinect\u2019s release.\nAdafruit Industries is currently offering this respectable chunk of cash to anyone able to create open source Kinect drivers which would\nallow the Kinect hardware to be utilized by\nother operating systems. Microsoft is (as most\npeople could have guessed) narked off and\nclaim the Kinect will be kept tamper-resistant.\nThey\u2019re fools to expect it to remain so \u2013 the\nonline modding and scripting community is\nmassive and Microsoft simply won\u2019t be able to\nstop the creation of open source drivers. Yes,\nKinect-enabled software sales might suffer,\nbut on the flip side it\u2019ll only improve hardware\nsales.\nSo should you go out and spend your student loan on a Kinect? The short answer is no\n(the long answer would take up several pages\nof writing). Why? Well, right now it\u2019s just far\ntoo expensive for what it is, a glorified TV\nremote that lets you play a few party games.\nAt this stage of gaming development, motion\nand sound-sensitive controllers cannot possibly\nhope to match the precision of the traditional\ncontroller or the mouse and keyboard so forget\nabout playing any sort of games that require a\nmodicum of aim.\nPerhaps one day motion and sound-sensitive\ndevices will surpass the good ol\u2019fashioned con-troller, but right now Kinect is just a stepping\nstone to that goal. I suppose I can\u2019t complain\nabout that \u2013 accurate motion capture technology just doesn\u2019t spring up overnight. It needs to\nbe tried and tested, perfected and honed. What\nI can complain about is the price. Unless you\nhave Xbox parties all the time and enjoy throwing yourself about like you have a bad case of\nthe hives, avoid it until it\u2019s much cheaper, has\nhad a few of its issues ironed out by Microsoft\nand supports a wider selection of games. Your\nwallet will thank you.\nThe Microsoft Kinect is available now for\nyour Xbox 360, retailing at \u00a3129.99.\nK\ninect, Microsoft\u2019s most recent\nperipheral for the Xbox 360, is\nset to arrive in UK stores by the\ntime your eyes are roving over\nthis article. There\u2019s been a fair\nbit of hype and excitement pertaining to Microsoft\u2019s latest gadget, but is it really justified? Is\nKinect the greatest thing since sliced bread or\nare customers going to be left in the dust?\nIf you\u2019ve been living under a rock for the last\nyear or so let me take a minute to fill you in.\nStep one: think of the Wii. Step two: apply it\nto the Xbox. There, you now have a good idea\nof what the Kinect is. It\u2019s a movement sensitive device that allows you to play games on\nthe Xbox without having to hold anything, so\nnow think of the Wii but without the remote.\nIt\u2019s also able to pick up voice commands, so go\nahead and glue a microphone onto the mental\nimage you have of the Wii.\nWith units already selling in Japan and N.\nAmerica, how has the Kinect been receieved\nup until now? Well, so far the reaction has been\nfairly positive. Internet gaming magazine Kotaku gave it decent marks in its review, praising\nin particular its ability to pick up voice com-mands, something I\u2019ve never trusted technology to do well so I\u2019ve got to give Microsoft\nsome marks for that. Overall, the opinion from\nKotaku seems to be that it\u2019s not a must own, at\nleast not yet. There are still some slow response\ntimes to be worked out when it comes to physical directions, but if you\u2019ve ever played on a\nWii you\u2019ll understand that these sort of devices\nare less than precise. Also, there are no great\ngames designed especially for the Kinect yet,\nso the Kinect\u2019s \u00a3130 price tag will no doubt\nmake you wince. Unless of course you\u2019re a\nstudent with marvellously rich parents who un-...while Laurence Pope looks into the brand new Xbox Kinect\nYet another\ngripping\ngame from\nthe WWE\nSimon Worthington\n\n"

The House Price Index compiled by\nthe Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors is down\nto -49 in the three months leading to October. This is\nsignificantly worse than any analyst\u2019s expectations.\nThe reason for the drop is a significant decrease in\nactivity in the mortgage sector and a lack of consumer confidence derived from the uncertain economic\noutlook. Mortgage approval has also taken a significant tumble, as fears of the austerity measurers are\nstarting to come into play.\nUK financials doing well in China\nPrime Minister David Cameron has managed to\nsecure preferential treatment for UK financial\nfirms in China, in lieu of American firms. This\nwas achieved during Cameron\u2019s visit to China in\nan attempt to sign trade deals and agreements.\nDavid Cameron has taken with him the largest\nbusiness delegation to date.\nGeorge Osborne, says that China finds it easier\nto do business with the UK than the US. Cameron stated that this deal will expand the economic relationship with China. Britain has also\nagreed to make plans to allow some Chinese\ncompanies to be listed on the UK stock market\nThis comes as news that some UK firms will\nhelp China develop its bond markets.\nRon Paul elected to oversee Fed\nWrite for Business\nRon Paul has been elected to chair the Financial Services Subcommittee on Domestic Monedary Policy.\nThis body is a supervisory one that has jurisdiction\nto oversee any activities related to US monetary\npolicy and the agencies that affect it, directly or indi-rectly. It is also a subcommittee that will allow Paul\nto oversee the activities of the US central bank, the\nFederal Reserve. This has been described by pundits\nas the \u201cperfect role\u201d for Ron Paul.\nFriday 12 November 2010\nIt is hard to argue that Imperial is not\none of the world\u2019s best universities;\nafter all, several independent and disconnected rankings tend to place it consistently in the top 10. With impending\nchanges to higher education funding, it\nis imperative that Imperial significantly\nengorges its endowment if it is to maintain this standing and keep pace in an increasingly competitive market for talent\nand high calibre students. In order to do\nso, Imperial faces enormous obstacles,\nsome of which will be nigh on impossible to overcome.\nAsystem heavily reliant on alumni donations is not one that can be institution-alised overnight. The reasons American\nuniversities are able to raise such exorbitant amounts is because there is a culture\nof giving back to your alma mater. The\nstudent experience in the UK is, with\nperhaps the exception of a few universi-ties, wildly different from the campus-based experience American universities\nare able to provide. In order to breed a\nculture where alumni donate regularly\nto Imperial, it must invest heavily and\ncontinuously in student life, fostering a\nsense of belonging to something great,\nin the true sense of the word. This exer-Imperial needs to star\nAfonso Campos\nrecommendations of the Browne re-view, although it did highlight some of\nits drawbacks. The Union is not alone\nin recognising the difficulties that lay\nahead. The College has officially acknowledged that \u201cstorm clouds are gathering\u201d and that there has been a \u201cgrowing concern\u201d regarding the \u201cinevitability\nof reductions in public spending\u201d.\nWhen the College\u2019s latest financial\nstatement (2008/2009) went to press,\nclose to half of Imperial\u2019s total income\nappears to be originated from pure-play\ngovernment sources with the income\nderived from endowment investment\ncoming to a mere 2% of the total. This\nis very different to the way Cambridge\noperates, where over 80% of its total income is made up of its endowment.\nEndowments have not traditionally\nbeen relied upon by most UK universities as public institutions, since much of\nWe need to feel\nlike we belong\ncise is likely to take decades, if it can be\nachieved at all.\nWhat may work in the College\u2019s favour\nis how surprisingly well it held up during\nthe financial crisis, securing an increase\nin total funding when most universities\nsuffered a dramatic loss. This is proving\nto be a real testament to the soundness\nof its investment policies and of Martin\nKnight\u2019s judgement in his role as Chief\nOperating Officer.Alumni are likely to be\nencouraged by such stellar performance.\nWhile it is without a doubt a colossal\ntask, Imperial has the clout, talent and\nability to make at least some headway in\nsignificantly increasing its endowment,\nthus securing a future that is free from\ngovernment intervention.\nA new drive for donations needs to be\nof unprecedented proportions.\nImperial College has long wished and\npledged to be among the world\u2019s elite\nof academia, continuously making the\nassertion that it can stack up proudly\nagainst the financial mammoths that are\nthe top American universities, Oxford\nand Cambridge. Its literature certainly\nhighlights the College\u2019s prominent and\nubiquitous presence in national and international rankings of universities. Already on-going is a race to the top, and\nwith the myriad of proposed changes to\nuniversities\u2019 funding models, it is bound\nto become more ferocious.\nThe contentious Browne Review has\nonce more brought into the spotlight\nthe longstanding and polarising issue of\nhigher education funding. The fact that it\nwas even commissioned in the first place\nhighlights the very grave status of university funding, especially in these difficult financial times, in which austerity\nis the mot-du-jour. Despite loud protests\nby many, there is a growing sentiment\nthat students need to start taking more\nfinancial responsibility for their education and the value they attach to it. There\nseems to be an increased understanding\nthat those who benefit most from their\ndegrees should be sharing the financial\nburden of undertaking them with the rest\nof the taxpaying population.\nWhile the news of a potential trebling of fees have galvanised many to\ntake to the streets in protest, the Imperial College Union Council has recently\npassed a policy that supports the broad\nAfonso Campos\n\u201cImperial has raised \u00a34m in\nalumni donations since 2003;\nequivalent to just 1.6% of what\nCambridge managed to collect\u201d\nYale University has one of the largest endowments in the world.

Both fashion\nand technology are constantly evolving\nindustries; fickle and always in search\nof the new \u2018it\u2019 product to entice buyers\ninto yet another superfluous purchase.\nTherefore one can only imagine the\nforce generated when these two polarised worlds collide...\nFashion Reconstructed\nSo firstly to all of you studying materials\nand engineering, take a look at the mad\nscientist of the fashion world, Mr Hussein Chalayan; a genius when it comes\nto designing clothes from the most unlikely recycled materials. One of his\nworks includes an airplane dress (SS\n\u201900) made from aircraft-construction\nmaterials. And, for those boys who fantasize about undressing a girl at the push\nof a button, this dress changes shape by\nremote control! But what really put his\nname on the fashion world map was his\nfollowing collection in which he transformed chairs and tables into skirts and\nother garments in front of the eyes of the\nfront row. And Lady GaGa, the queen of\navant-garde, is also a fan - remember the\nbubble dress from her fame ball tour? -she \u2018re-created\u2019 it from his SS\u201907 show.\nSo what are you waiting for? Get the\npencils out from behind your ears and\nyour measuring tapes from your back\npocket and get creative!\nGeometric Proportions\nNow, attention maths geeks: why not\nfollow Issey Miyake\u2019s lead and put the\nGolden Ratio to good use to produce\nunique geometric garments. Her collection \u2018132.5. Issey Miyake\u2019, was inspired\nby none other than the computer scientist Jun Mitani who has produced a programme that can create 3-D structures\nfrom a single sheet of paper just like\norigami! Issey Miyake explains the title\nof her collection, \u201c1\u201d signifies a single\npiece of fabric; \u201c3\u201d and \u201c2\u201d refer to the\nthree-dimensional shape which can be\nflattened into a two-dimensional form;\nand \u201c5\u201d is a reference to the fifth dimension.\u201c The fifth dimension, according to\nMiyake, is the precise moment when the\ngarment is worn on the body and comes\nto life. If only geometry back at school\nwas more like this\u2026.\nFashion Surgery\nA quick one for you medics\u2026Instead of\ntwiddling your thumbs during the next\nMCD practical, why not steal some of the\nequipment to create your own version of\nDutch haute-tech designer Anouk Wipprecht\u2019s dresses: Pseudomorphs. She\nuses repurposed medical equipment and\ncustom designed electronics attached to\na neck brace to trickle ink down a white\ndress to produce a unique pattern. Then\nagain, I wouldn\u2019t advice trying this out\nwith red dye on scrubs, you probably\nwon\u2019t get a great response for your \u2018art\u2019\nfrom your patients!\nLet there be light\nLast but not least, EEE. The current catwalk\u2019s latest craze is illuminating their\nclothes and accessories. Anastasia Radevich has created a stunning collection of\nshoes for 2011. The designs themselves\nare head-turners but made even more\nmagical with the added feature of a\nmesh of LED lights. However, the most\ninspirational collection must once again\nbe Mr Chalayan\u2019s Swarovski Tokyo\nShow \u201908. By aiming red lasers at crys-tal-encrusted dresses, he created a mes-merising burning embers effect. This is\nwhere I feel fashion truly becomes art. A\nYouTube watch is a must.\nFor those interested in the future of\nfashion, I highly recommend a trip to\nthe Barbican where they have an exhibition on the leaders of techno-couture, the\nJapanese. The Future Beauty: 30 years of\nJapanese fashion is open until February\n2011. I hope I have managed to inspire\nsome of you to direct your scientific\nminds in a more artistic direction, proving that us geeks can do fashion. Radevich\u2019s stunning LED ankle boots, lighting up catwalks everywhere\nThe Search of the Perfect Winter Boot\nIn-keeping with the shearling trend for winter, Felix checks out Ugg\u2019s competition,\nwhich comes in the unusual form of CAT\u2019s uber-functional and furry footwear\nJennifer Smith\nAs seen on the Autumn/Winter 2010\ncatwalks of Milan, CAT\u2019s shearling-lined work boots are quickly becoming\nthe hot fashion trend of this winter. With\nan eclectic mix of designs for men and\nwomen, CAT presents an ideal footwear\nsolution for those seeking a boot encapsulating functionality and vintage style.\nCAT have based their A/W 2010 collection on three key concepts. The Rugged collection aims to retain a classical\nCAT image, whilst maintaining versatility and making the boots easy to wear.\nThe women\u2019s boot Nena (\u00a389.99) is a\ngreat example of this. Incorporating the\ntraditional CAT hiker styling with a padded tweed ankle detail for ultimate com-fort, this boot should be worn loose over\njeans for the ultimate casual look.\nThe Casual collection aims to maintain CAT\u2019s rugged signature style\nwhilst incorporating a modern twist.\nThe men\u2019s Evolve boot (\u00a399.99) maintains CAT\u2019s signature oil resistant rubber grip sole and thick fleece lining\nyet integrates this season\u2019s lumberjack\ntrend for a quirky take on an established classic.\nFinally, the Active collection offers\nfunctional and comfortable boots for the\nconsumer who is energetic at heart. The\nmen\u2019s Apa boot inspired trainer (\u00a374.99)\nfeatures a leather upper with a sturdy\nrubber sole, making it ideal for ambling\nthrough the countryside, while the women\u2019s Molten boot (\u00a384.99) incorporates\na fur lining into its sturdy design, making it the perfect winter warmer.\nCAT footwear effectively manages\nto withstand both changing weather\nand changing trends. The company is\ncommitted to developing durable yet\nfashionable boots which incorporate\npioneering technological features with\noriginal designs. While the idea of\nwearing footwear made by the world\u2019s\nlargest manufacturer of construction and\nmining equipment may not be for every-one, for those wanting to be fashion forward and break the stranglehold that is\nUgg, CAT boots might be right up your\nstreet.\nCAT boots are available in Schuh\nstores nationwide.\nCAT presents it\u2019s brand new,\nfashion-forward collection,\nenticing those bored by the\nubiquitous Ugg boot\n\n"

On one wall is a\nstained glass window and\nrows of antique coffee pots;\non the other, a vintage electric guitar.\nThis perfect blend of the rustic and retro\narrests the senses, and something tells\nyou you\u2019re in for a treat.\nWith its buzzing atmosphere and\nquirky personality, warm and friendly\nstaff, the Troubadour is a perfect place\nfor a first date or an alternative night out\nwith friends. Traditional English food\nis served in great volume to small, intimate tables, and quality is certainly not\ncompromised for a reasonable price tag;\nmeals start from \u00a38, with steaks nearing\n\u00a320, but why not treat yourself? Between us we sampled the fish and chips\nand the popular Troubadour burger,\nnoting the refreshing lack of grease, attention to detail and general perfection.\nThe fish and chips may have been \u00a313,\nbut wow, that is what you call fish and\nchips! It is worth noting that all ingredients are sourced locally and with great\ncare, the secret to the dishes\u2019 perfec-tion. If these are not for you though, you\ncould always try one of their omelettes\nor salads. And most importantly, such\nhearty portions still allowed room for\ndessert! The apple crumble was flawless\nand the brownie literally melts in your\nmouth.\nAdding to the eclectic feel of the Troubadour is the basement nightclub. Rich\nin history it has hosted the likes of Bob\nDylan and Jimi Hendrix, and, more re-cently, Paulo Nutini. Every week a selection of exciting performers who write\nand perform their own material, treat\naudiences to a novel experience. Particularly pertinent to student tastes, the\nnightclub serves 2-4-1 cocktails, available from 8-9pm.\nThe garden is yet another asset to the\nTroubadour\u2019s charm. Under a grape vine\ncanopy, this hideaway provides a tranquil environment right in the busy centre of Earl\u2019s Court, a short tube journey\nfrom South Kensington. The adjacent\nTroubadour wine shop is also worth a\nstop. The shelves are stocked with unusual wines from around the world with\nprices to challenge supermarket prices.\nFrom 9am onwards the Troubadour\nAnyone up for a Snog? It\u2019s juicy, saucy... it\u2019s yoghurt.\nFrozen Yoghurt is a tasty cold treat, and\nLondon has caught the cold. It\u2019s going round. If it was a warmer foodstuff\nthey\u2019d say it was spreading like wild-fire. Instead, it\u2019s spreading more like the\nStarbucks and Subways that now punctuate every high street. This is an ice-age\nmoment after years of hot coffees and\nwarm pastries. Cold is the hottest new\nthing in edible delights, and what a delight it is!\nIf it wasn\u2019t already apparent, I absolutely love the stuff. I love its refreshing\ntart taste. I even prefer it to ice-cream,\nand its low calorific content means it\ncarries little of the guilt despite lots of\nthe pleasure.\nBut it wouldn\u2019t be nearly so joyous\na thing if served by some sweaty man-hair hybrid into a polystyrene tray-box\nin a Turkish chippy behind Ladbroke\nGrove. The ambience is the thing.\nThough Frozen Yoghurt itself is being\nsold in more and more food places, it is\nthe dedicated frozen yoghurt bars and\ntheir common sense of funk that are the\nmost fun. With their sleek interiors and\ncandy colours they are like a portal into\na future wonderland of cool and verve.\nIt is as if someone syphoned off people\u2019s\nfantasies of Tokyo and urban-chic, then\npoured it into the shop-mould to set.\nHere, life is Pop.\nI can see the doubt in your eyes. You\nhave yet to experience this Narnia of\nmodernity. Luckily there are several\nlocal places that you can try, including\nSnog in South Kensington, Frog in Bayswater and GoYog! in Hammersmith.\nEven their names rhyme! Clearly they\nare destined to enter folklore, made into\nsongs sung by men of the future about\nthis time of culinary change.\nPerhaps. As for reviewing these dairy\nemporiums I will say this: Snog is delicious but the priciest. Frog, opposite\nBayswater station tastes the same and\nhas a two-for-one deal for students,\nwhich makes itABargain\u2122. It also has a\nstrawberry flavour not found anywhere\nelse that is super tasty, faintly recalling\nstrawberry fromage frais but with added\nF.Y.D. (frozen-yoghurt-deliciousness)\nfactor. GoYog! in Hammersmith has the Dancing flappers, illegal moonshine but no Wall Street Crash in sight\nTROUBADOUR HAS HEART\nJamie Williams and Hannah Tullett visit\nEarl\u2019s Court coffee house and music venue\nstarts its day as one of the Top 50 places\nto eat breakfast in London, so why not\ncheck out the full English? Failing that,\nstop in for a coffee during the day and\nwatch the world go by. Our advice?\nDon\u2019t miss out on the buzz that is syn-Omar Hafeez-Bore\n\u201cRich in history it has\nhosted the likes of\nBob Dylan, Jimi Hendrix and, more re-cently, Paulo Nutini\u201d\nworst topping selection and only one\nyoghurt flavour (despite what that crafty\nblackboard tells you), but like Frog has\na two-for-one deal for students and a\nyoghurt that tastes distinctly different to\nboth Snog and Frog. It is creamier and\nless tart.\nThis may sound like the obsessive\ndetail of an addict, but you\u2019d be wrong.\nKnowing the workers at Frog on firstname terms is what makes me an ad-dict. If I could snort the stuff I would.\nIn fact, if you could snort the stuff I\u2019d\nmake my own new outlet called Snort.\nI\u2019d put it opposite boujis and make a\nkilling.

    "content": "GAMES\nFELIX\nFriday 12 november 2010\nGames Editor: Simon Worthington\ngames.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nvariety of party style games, a Wii-esque introduction not lost on anyone I\u2019m sure. The first\ngame I picked to try was the on-rails shoot\u2019emup The Shoot. From the first movie-set-card-board-cut-out you cruelly gun down you realise\nexactly how comfortably this game, the Eye\nand Move are working together. Shooting and\naiming comes naturally until that tricky shot arrives and you find yourself nailing a precision\nshot with what feels about the right level of dif-ficulty. You won\u2019t (nerd rage aside) be blaming\na faulty controller for the bad guy who managed to get one off against you.\nIn fact this demo not only demonstrated\nthe on-screen recognition of the system but\nalso intuitive touches that Nintendo rarely\nfound time for. Some power-ups are activated by shooting above the screen, different ones for beneath and in keeping with\nthe arcade tradition reloading can be done\nto the side. As you may have also heard, another great thing about the Move controller\nis that it comes with the Z-Distance of Wii+\nas standard. Though this didn\u2019t seem to be of\nhuge use in most situations (excluding the insane table tennis smashes you can lay down)\nmuch like PS3 Six-Axis I have a deep faith that\ngames will step forward able to really utilise it\nand make another step forward in the tech-nology.\nIs all this to good to be true? Well, perhaps a\nlittle. In keeping an open mind I considered the\npossibility that the demos Sony were pushing\nmay not be a complete insight into how well\nthe technology really works. This meant stepping into the 3rd party software: the stumbling\nground of the Nintendo Wii and perhaps that\nof Sony too. Tiger Woods 10 promised a full\nsize launch title with a somewhat shoehorned\nMove compatibility, which is something I do\nnot commend them on. After spending twenty\nor thirty minutes enabling the Move controller,\nI spent the next hour getting my first shot to go\nwhere I wanted it. Frustrated and annoyed by\nthe game\u2019s attempt to turn my arms inside out\nin order to line up a shot I turned it off and had\na five minute hissy.\nPerhaps, I thought, this all really wasn\u2019t\nworth it? A hard days pay and a mediocre trade\nin deal of Battlefield Bad Company 2 for some\nmore party games? As I contemplated this my\nsister walked in, oblivious to me and her surroundings altogether. She picked up my discarded controller and starts playing with her\n\u2018EyePet\u2019 - a virtual pet that can be petted and\ntickled. Perhaps it was the weaponised levels\nof cuteness, perhaps I\u2019d just refelected that I\nalways hated any sort of motion technology (I\nplay Super Smash Brothers Brawl with Gamecube controllers) but I realised that the Move\nisn\u2019t just for me. If my technophobic sister can\nbe won over then Sony have done something\nright. Maybe they\u2019ll win me around too because I certainly won\u2019t be trading it in \u2013 it\u2019s\ndefinitely worth more than that. That is, if she\never gets off that fucking EyePet and lets me\nplay more Fallout.\nWeb Games\nEach week we\u2019re going to bring you a selection of\nfresh, free and fun web games that you can play right\naway in your browser. Unless otherwise specified,\nyou\u2019re going to need the Adobe Flash Player plug-in\nwhich can be installed from http://get.adobe.com/\nflashplayer/.\nBejeweled Blitz\napps.facebook.com/bejeweledblitz\nEven if you\u2019ve never played this particular version,\nchances are you\u2019ve stumbled upon this gem-swap-ping family of games before. Blitz is a timed variant\nof the classic formula: you have just 60 seconds to\nscore as many points as you can by making rows of\nthree, four or five gems.\nThe one minuite limit really helps to pick up the pace\nand makes the game much more exciting than its\nplacid predecessor. Try and get into a rhythm for a\nsignificant speed bonus!\nT\nhe Playstation 3 has long been regarded as the antithesis to Nintendo Wii\u2019s modern video game phi-losophy. Where Nintendo offered\nfamily-orientated offline multiplayer with cutesy graphics all in a compact\nconsole, Sony opted for a monolith designed\nto have a greater capacity than could be utilised\nby game designers at launch and aesthetically\ntargetted at the somewhat small audience of\nStanley Kubrick and Darth Vader.\nFrom the day the PS3 entered the market until the moment Sony first announced its Move\ntechnology it had seemed like this gap was\nincreasingly widening. Nintendo was witnessing a sharp decline in third party interest in\ndeveloping games for its \u201cgimmicky system\u201d\nwhilst the PS3 was bouncing back from initial\ncriticism to produce games of such graphical\nquality that real life began to seem somewhat\nlow res. However, to a mixed reaction and possibly in response to the undeniable volume of\nsales that the Wii continued to generate and\nXbox\u2019s Kinect announcement, Sony weighed\nin with it\u2019s own interpretation of motion gam-ing. What\u2019s stranger, they told us they could\nbring the \u2018hardcore\u2019 games with them.\nThe launch titles, we were told, would include fully compatible FPS and fighting games\nthat would pull no punches just because you\nwould be waving a motion controller at them.\nThough these titles are yet to hit the market,\nwhat\u2019s here now is all we need to examine the\ncurrent full variety of control Move offers.\nThe first thing you notice when you pick up\nthe main Move controller is how well it fits into\nyour hand. Technically I suppose this might\nbe the second thing for most people after the\nlarge glowing ball on top used by the PS Eye\nto identify it, but that aside this really was a big\npart for me. One thing that came out from criticism of the Wii Remote was that the shape was\nsimply not as ergonomic as it could be. Super\nMario Galaxy is one of the best games of the\ngeneration but who can enjoy it if they don\u2019t\nlike the feel or layout of the controller?\nHowever, as I was testing it without the optional \u2018navigation\u2019 stick, the second thing I\nnoticed was how annoyingly awkward holding the standard PS3 controller in one hand\nwas to navigate through the menus on Tiger\nWoods 2010. I could use all kinds of terms and\nnames (\u2018money grabbing capitalists!\u2019 for one)\nto describe Sony and the choice to sell these\ntwo peripherals separately. In a way I do appreciate that not everybody wants the navigation\nstick \u2013 these same people probably don\u2019t yell\nat loading screens or get into flame wars with\n14 year old kids \u2013 but I just happen to not be\none of those people. Though it is by no means\nparticularly expensive, to not offer a combined\npack was for me the first mark against the commitment to keeping PlayStation \u2018hardcore\u2019.\nNo-one will be playing FarCry or Call of Duty\n31: CoD In Space with a DualShock 3 in their\nleft hand.\nThe optional demos from PSN offered a good\nThe next revolution in\nDexter Tarr gets his hands on the Sony Playstation Move...\n32\nCellCraft\ncellcraftgame.com\nDespite stinking ever-so-slightly of a, *shudder*, educational game, this biology-based adventure RPG is\nactually quite entertaining. Taking control of the cell,\nmoving it along and building ribosomes and other\nthings is fun as you can zoom in and see everything\nhappening, and there\u2019s an incredible amount of detail in the way the game works. Quite why, then, the\ndevelopers felt the need to include a plot featuring\ntalking duck-billed platypuses is a true mystery.\n\n"

Jake Lea-Wilson investigates\nW\ne\u2019ve been stuck with\n3G (Third Generation) networks in the\nUK since March\n2003. Technology\nhas moved on significantly in the last\nseven years, but unfortunately we have\nnot. The USA, Japan and most of Europe have already signed deals and are\nset to have the next generation of mobile networks operational in under 12\nmonths. In fact in Germany and India,\nwe\u2019ve already seen the government auction off the frequencies that are required\nto broadcast these networks to cellular\nproviders. In short, we\u2019re well behind\nthe game.\nOur current top speed on British networks is around 3Mb/s, and this has\nonly really been taken advantage of in\nthe past few years, since the introduction of the iPhone and similar high-end\nsmartphones. We\u2019ve become a dependent nation and the demand for high-speed data is growing by the day. 4G\nLTE (Long Term Evolution) is a dynamic new network that promises to\ngive us download speeds of up to 300\nMb/s. Make no mistake, this is going to\nhave a huge impact on our daily lives;\nwe\u2019ll no longer need to find a computer\nterminal to watch video news, films\nand catch-up TV. We\u2019ll be truly mobile,\nwith some saying that all our data will\nbe stored remotely in the cloud and accessed with ease from anywhere. We\u2019ll\nhave a door to every song, book, and\nfilm ever recorded within seconds and\nin high definition. Not to mention the\nimpact it\u2019s likely to have on mobile\ngaming. It\u2019s also expected to make\nbroadband and traditional broadcast\nTV defunct, as we\u2019ll have quicker-than-broadband speeds everywhere we\ngo. The face of the television industry\ncould change dramatically moving to\na model more closely resembling the\nBBC iPlayer and the Sky equivalent.\nWhy are we behind in these high tech-nology, fast-moving times? It\u2019s down to\nthe launch of the last networks back in\n2003. There was such a hype surrounding the new networks that the mobile\nproviders overpaid for the frequencies,\nlosing a large amount of money in the\ngamble. Remember those annoying\nThree adverts for video calling? It never\nreally caught on because the technology didn\u2019t deliver. We all marvelled at\nour friends\u2019 phones showing pixelated,\nblurred faces moving on small screens,\nsounding like a cross between a tin helicopter and a gale-force wind. It didn\u2019t\nwork over 3G, this is why the latest\niPhone only offers video calling through\nWiFi. The government auctioned five\ndifferent frequencies back then, for a total amount of over \u00a322bn. It was a staggering price and it doesn\u2019t compare at\nall to the new 4G LTE networks that are\ngoing for around \u00a34bn in India.\nLet\u2019s hope that the government and\nmobile operators can start to work together and not against each other. We\nneed to avoid a similar situation to 10\nyears ago, where markets were grossly\nmisjudged. We\u2019ve got the technology,\nthere\u2019s a proven demand, so why not\nget the supply and we can start watching\nHD TV ubiquitously.\nDiaspora is an open source social network built\nby four students at NYU\u2019s Courant Institute;\nDaniel Grippi, Maxwell Salzberg, Raphael Sofaer, and Ilya Zhitomirskiy.\nThey had been inspired by a talk about freedom and ownership online, by Eben Moglenn,\nand focussed by the fact that the large social\nnetworks require us to sacrifice lots of our privacy for features that aren\u2019t anything special.\nThe project was published using Kickstarter,\na funding platform for creative projects, in\nApril 2010, with the team attempting to raise\n$10,000 by the 1st of June in order to begin\nwork on it.\nThe four students persuaded more than 6000\npeople to contribute money to the project,\nmaking it the largest Kickstarter project ever,\nand managed to collect well over $200,000.\nThis outpouring of funding instilled them with\na strong motivation to get their idea off the\nground and available to all.\nThe four Diaspora creators believe that privacy and social connectivity do not have to be\nmutually exclusive. The system they created\nallows users to create their own, personally\nhosted versions of Diaspora, called seeds, providing greater control of your information.\nAs Maxwell explains it: \u201cDiaspora will give\nto every single person in the entire world the\nopportunity to install their own node within the\nnetwork. This node is fully controlled by you.\nYou can share and pass all the information you\nwant. It\u2019s completely yours and you can extend\nit in whatever you want to.\u201d\nA developer edition has already been released on GitHub, implementing many fea-tures. For Diaspora users, all traffic is signed\nand encrypted (except photos, for now), unlike\nFacebook and its HTTP issues. A seed connects to other services such as Facebook, Twitter, Flickr, and pulls information back to the\nlocal host.\nAt the moment Diaspora has all the features\nof a basic social network, although it lacks the\nlevel of interactivity of Facebook. Users can\nshare status messages and photos publicly and\nprivately, upload photo albums, add and manage friends across the Internet, no matter where\ntheir Diaspora seed is located. The really interesting thing is that it\u2019s possible to customize\nyour seed\u2019s appearance and add new services\nand features, as the platform is open-source. For\nthe developers amongst us, it is programmed\nusing Ruby on Rails, MongoDB/MongoMapper, and GPG with full keychain support.\nBut the development team promises more\nto its users. In the near future, their plan is to\nimplement data portability, which it will give\nusers the ability to move their accounts to new\nseeds and notify all of their friends about the\nchange. Furthermore, they want to use the\nbrowser\u2019s language header to internationalise\nDiaspora, so it can be easily used in many\nlanguages. Plus an undo button (something\nakin to gmail\u2019s undo send), private messag-ing, events and photo tagging are also in the\ntodo list. Diaspora certainly shows promise,\nbut like most open-source things, could stray\ninto the geek-only, mainstream shunning side\nof technical know-how. If Diaspora is to succeed as Facebook has, it has to cater to the\nlowest common denominator, including the\nInternet-challenged.\nAnyone who wants to learn more about Diaspora can follow it on twitter, Facebook, or\nhead on over www.joindiaspora.com.\nThe privacy aware, personally controlled, do-it-all, open source social network\nDiaspora: social without the invasion\nAnastasia Eleftheriou\n\u201cWhy are we so far\nbehind these fast-moving times?

At least\nhe\u2019s living La Dolce Vita\nS\nilvio Berlusconi is, in his own\nwords, \u201cthe best political leader in\nEurope and the world.\u201d To most\nforeign commentators, however,\nhe is at best a carefree, flamboyant\nplayboy who likes to throw sexy parties at his\nSardinian Villa. He makes Hugh Hefner seem\nan amateur, and Bill Clinton a choir boy. At\nworst, he is accused of being a supremely corrupt businessman, with excessive control over\nthe nation\u2019s media, alleged links to the mafia,\nand a predisposition for bribery and fraud.\nDefending this ex-cruise ship crooner might\ntherefore seem as difficult as supporting the\nintentions of a charming spotty-faced, white\ntracksuit-laden youth who likes to loiter around\nbus stops at three in the morning. But there are\narguments in favour of the Italian Prime Minister, and they merit attention, starting with his\ngaffes and highly charged libido.\nBerlusconi is often ridiculed in the media for\nhis outlandish remarks and apparent inability\nto control his more basic instincts. Last week,\nhe managed to combine both by intervening in\nthe release of a 17 year old belly dancer who\nattended parties at his house and stating in the\nprocess that it is \u201cbetter to like beautiful girls\nthan to be gay.\u201d But a wavering eye towards\nthe opposite sex does not necessarily have any\ndirect bearing on a person\u2019s ability to be competent in the work place. Bill Clinton\u2019s adventures with Monika Lewinsky did not stop him\nfrom leaving office with the highest approval\nrating of any US president since the 2nd World\nWar, and did not detract from his role in supervising the longest period of peace-time economic growth in US history.\nThat Berlusconi likes to provoke the media\nwith regular witticisms should, in principle,\nalso be irrelevant to his ability to address the\nnation\u2019s concerns. Boris Johnson is renowned\nfor his penchant to crack the occasional gag\n(who can forget his call for the Tories to be the\n\u201cmeat\u201d in the coalition government\u2019s sausage),\nyet since being Mayor of London he has defied the critics who had haughtily predicted\nthat City Hall would collapse into a complete\nshambles. Berlusconi\u2019s policies and legal accusations aside, therefore, his fondness for jokes\nand fruity girls is irrelevant to his capability to\ngovern Italy. To his critics it is, if anything, a\ndangerous distraction from the far more serious legal crimes he is charged with. It serves\nto portray him as a bumbling fool instead of a\nhardened and ruthless businessman.\nThen there is the weakness of the opposition.\nBerlusconi is the second longest-serving Prime\nMinister of Italy. He has held the job on three\nseparate occasions: from 1994 to 1995, from\n2001 to 2006 and since 2008. Only one Italian government has lasted a full five-year term\nin the past fifty years, and that is Berlusconi\u2019s\nfrom 2001 to 2006. In 2006, he lost the election\nto Romano Prodi by a whisker \u2013 only to see\nthe new government collapse in 2008. The left\nare not strong enough to fight back. In essence,\nwhatever the pitfalls of Berlusconi, the sad fact\nis that there is currently no one better to run the\ncountry. It is plausible that if he were ousted\ntoday, the work he has done to help Italy avoid\nthe credit concerns that have swamped Greece\nwould become undone by the renewed politically unstable climate.\nBut whether Berlusconi is, in his own immortal words, \u201cthe right man in the right job\u201d might\njust not be the most important thing. Italy is a\nplace where masochistic lamentation is pervasive and Italians fail all too often to recognise\nthe good things Italy has to offer. People may\nlaugh at Italy and its politics, but nothing can\nThe world beyond\nCollege walls\nEdited by Kenneth Lee\nHaiti\nA series of bombings and mortar attacks targeting\nChristian areas has killed at least three people in\nthe Iraqi capital, Baghdad, according to the Iraqi\nofficials.\nThe attacks come days after militants seized a Catholic cathedral killing 70.

They are\nmore likely to argue about their gnocchi than\ntheir politics. Perhaps Berlusconi has done so\nwell simply because his party is called \u201cForza\nItalia!\u201d (literally \u201cCome on Italy!\u201d), akin to the\nchants heard across the country on a Sunday\u2019s\nSerie A match day when the passionate tifosi\ncry out \u201cForza Juve!\u201d, \u201cForza Inter!\u201d, \u201cForza\nMilan!\u201d And perhaps they have got the balance right - to quote the illustrious composer\nGiuseppe Verdi \u201cYou may have the universe if\nI may have Italy.\u201d\nThe Haitian Government has confirmed an outbreak of cholera in the capital Port-au-Prince.\n73 people have been treated so far amidst fears\nthat an outbreak could spread throughout the capital after Hurricane Tomas battered the Caribbean\nnation causing flooding and sanitation problems.\nUp to 2.5 million people could be affected in the\narea around the Haitian capital if more outbreaks\nare confirmed.

    "content": "21\nfelix FRIDAY 12 november 2010\nCOMMENT\nFirst year isn\u2019t stale just yet\nO\nh goody! Another subject to rant on about in\na pedantic and pompous tone of voice. Well,\nmore like splitting hairs\nin a self-important manner really. Either\nway, the headline \u201cIs the first year of a\ndegree a waste of time?\u201d is the sort of\ntrashy headline calculated to get Radio\nFour listeners heading for the hills.\nNeedless to say, it has nothing\nwhatsoever to do with missing out\nthe first year, but re-structuring three\nyear degree courses so that they take\n24 months rather than 33. This sadly\nmisses the point, that technical degrees\nworth having now last four years, but\nI digress.\nWe live in a fast age. People want to\nget on, to make something of themselves\nin the best years of their lives -- maybe\nso they can do something before they\u2019re\ntold to retire and before strikes affect the\nindustry in which they work. Easy when\nyou think about it isn\u2019t it? Every eighteen\u2013year\u2013old school leaver obviously\nthinks of it in just that way.\nIt\u2019s more likely that they have money\non their minds, but are only dimly aware\nSam Furse\nof the full financial consequences of a\nshorter course. Someone on a two-year-long degree is still going to have to meet\nsignificant costs, and is not going to\nhave time to do paid work as there will\nbe four terms in a year, and no \u2018summer\u2019. They won\u2019t to be able to shop\naround, or exist healthily on the cheap\nstuff (who can?), they won\u2019t have time\nto earn money or do extra-mural or ul-tra-curricular activities.\nArguably, one might be willing to\nmake this sacrifice. The short-term cost\nimplications may be worth it as there is\npotential for an additional year of work\nrather than study. Trouble is, although\nHR managers and agencies like a good\nFirst class degree, in reality a 2(i) with\nsomething else to say -- be it knitting or\nflower arranging -- will get you further.\nEmployers want something else to look\nat on paper, something else to talk about\nat interviews. Sitting at a desk and doing work is fine, but is not good enough\non its own.\nConversely, things in education do\nchange and getting left behind is at least\nas bad as being right too early. Under the\ncurrent system, academics who teach,\nwhich is most of them, have space to research and publish. It is easy to dismiss\nthis as an academic selfishness, and in\na perverse way it is. It allows them to\nspend time learning from their students.\nThat is undoubtedly a good thing, and\nit is the same logic as to why generally\nthose in healthcare prefer teaching hospitals to district ones.\nThe time for extra activities lost by\nthose doing two year degrees might\nreasonably be balanced by a year of\ntravelling, volunteering or gambling af-terwards. Or would that be missing the\npoint? Probably\u2026\nMy advice to anyone thinking of a\none, two or even three year degree? Do\nwhat you think will suit you and just\ndive in. You will never know what it\nwould have been like any other way,\nand it does not matter because you will\nprobably have the right degree for you\nanyway.\nEnjoy it, whatever the cost or however long it lasts. Of course there will\nbe ups and downs, but imbibing human\nachievement, or even contributing to it,\nis one of the most rewarding things one\ncan do.\nDear Sirs,\nFelix\u2019s interview with Claire Fox about\nthe Institute of Ideas\u2019 \u201cBattle of Ideas\u201d\ndebate weekend made interesting reading [October 15, 2010, p. 9]. The accompanying photo\u2019s caption had me\nlooking forward to \u201ca show of wits\u201d, but\nthe questions were none too probing; instead Fox simply plugged the institute\u2019s\nevent and bemoaned science and society\nfor a thousand-odd words.\nFox says that \u201c[o]ur [presumably the\nInstitute\u2019s] concern is that scientists\nrarely admit that reality is more complicated than the statistics\u201d. This is the kind\nof complaint that sounds compelling and\ndeep right up until the moment one actually thinks about it, at which point it\nimmediately falls apart.\nI doubt Fox has any good evidence\nthat the vast majority of scientists\nwon\u2019t discuss what their statistics don\u2019t\ncapture; certainly the idea doesn\u2019t jibe\nwith my experience. There are many\nscientists who come to conclusions that\nare too strong, true. Some omit important caveats about their work, true. But\nwhat proportion of scientists do this\nconsistently? Is it so high that only a\nhandful of scientists acknowledge the\nlimits of available data? That\u2019s hardly\ncredible, especially considering how\nmany scientists strive to expose others\u2019\nblind spots.\nNext she suggests that scientists\n\u201cdon\u2019t trust that the public will be able\nto handle an issue which has a less\nblack-or-white answer. Scientists contribute to that view, and we suggest we\nhave a more intelligent debate over the\nrole of science in society.\u201d\nBut what if it sometimes happens to\nbe an accurate view? Then Fox has summarily dismissed it just for the sake of\npromoting her institute\u2019s position as\n\u201cmore intelligent\u201d. Surely she can think\nof times when members of the public\nhave poorly handled uncertainty about\nscientific issues? If not, I suggest she\nlooks at current views of global warm-ing, or of the MMR vaccine ten years\nbefore that.\nFox complains about \u201cthe climate\nof mistrust [that] has gone too far\u201d,\nbut poorly-founded attacks on scientists contribute to that same climate of\nmistrust.\nMoreover, it\u2019s hard to avoid the suspicion that the \u201ccontroversial\u201d Institute\nof Ideas\u2019 focus on \u201clive debate\u201d (a poor\nsubstitute for serious truth-seeking) and\n\u201cchalleng[ing] orthodoxies\u201d is likely to\ncultivate still more cynicism and mistrust in its audiences. I expect its approach is an effective way to manufacture publicity, but \u201can intelligent public\narena\u201d?

If we do not fight for our\nright to know what the government and\nits agencies are doing, we are effectively\ngiving them carte blanche. This can easily lead to corruption and other abhorrent behaviour by politicians acting for\ntheir own good, or a misguided idea of\nthe public good.\nOne of the best examples is that of\nparliamentary expenses. If not for the\nefforts of the media, MPs would have\nsucceeded in their attempts to conceal\nthe immoral behaviour of some of their\nnumber, and the practice of over\u2013claiming for expenses might still be widespread today.

We\ncannot trust them and the government to\nbe the only ones to decide what reaches\nthe light of day, especially as much of\nit incriminates or embarrasses them. Recent and persistent allegations of British\ncomplicity and even participation in torture seem to support this. It is too easy\nto hide behind excuses.\nReleasing evidence about the Bombings is unlikely to lead to any similar\nscandals but it will help to give the victims\u2019 families closure and might pressure the authorities to improve their\nmethods of combating terrorism. The\ngovernment\u2019s opposition to this is illogical and I agree with Lady Justice Hallett that the documents to be seen will\ndo Britain no harm if certain sensitive\nnames and details are blanked out.

    "content": "18\nCOMMENT\nfelix\nFRIDAY 12 NOVEMBER 2010\nS\ncience and engineering have\nserious institutional problems when it comes to diver-sity. I say this as head of an\norganisation whose purpose\nit is to champion this sector.\nOnly one in ten graduate engineers are\nwomen. Disabled people make up 5.9%\nof the total workforce, but only 3.8% in\nscience, engineering, and technology.\nOnly one in twenty chemistry lecturers\nisn\u2019t white. Amongst our international\ncompetitors, the UK ranks disappointingly badly when it comes to how student\nperformance in science and maths correlates with socio-economic background.\nThere are lots of reasons why this\nshould be, and some of them are complicated and obscure \u2013 but it\u2019s obvious why\nit\u2019s unacceptable.\nThousands of people are being deterred from careers they would excel in,\nwhich is a loss to those individuals. But\nit also means a loss to society, and the\neconomy. We\u2019re talking about thousands\nof people who could be making advanc-es, and might be excelling in their field,\nif it wasn\u2019t due to the discrimination\nwhich seems to be built-in to our science\nand engineering establishment.\nAnd when I say \u2018establishment\u2019, I\ndon\u2019t refer to remote upper echelons.\nLook around you. More than six in seven of all professors at Imperial College\nare male. Less than one in ten black African applicants end up getting in.\nProgress is being made. For instance,\nImperial is one of only two universities\nthat ranked in the top 100 LGBT workplaces last year, and the gender gap for\nacademics here is (very slowly) narrow-ing. But the statistics highlight the scale\nof the problem. It\u2019s going to take decades of consistent effort before we can\nsafely say that regardless of the circumstances of your birth or your lifestyle,\nyou\u2019ve got an equal chance of making it\nas a scientist or engineer.\nSo it\u2019s really quite important that if\nsomething looks set to start to unravel\ngood work which has already been done,\nit must be countered. In the Higher Education funding reforms we could face\nsuch a challenge.\nBroadly, the reforms go far in securing\nlower graduate contributions from the\nlowest earners. But they may fail in one\ncrucial respect that\u2019s very relevant to us.\nIt\u2019s no secret that science and engineering degrees cost more than arts and\nhumanities to teach. Think of the cost of\na physics laboratory versus a philosophy\nlibrary. Luckily, current funding models\nmean that (as long as you\u2019re not a foreign student) you have free choice over\nwhat to study, because all degrees have\nthe same annual cost. That may be about\nto change.\nThe government has left the door\nopen to universities now charging differential fees for different subjects. Although there may still be some central\ngovernment funding for STEM degrees,\nit won\u2019t necessarily be enough to make\nsure those degrees don\u2019t cost more than\narts and humanities.\nWe already know that the cost of go-Pale, stale and male\ning to university affects student choice.\nFor instance, some students (particu-larly those from certain ethnic minori-ties) choose to live at home rather than\nmoving out, based on financial consid-erations. This obviously limits which\nuniversities they can attend.\nThe danger is that students may soon\nbe forced into taking their second-choice\ndegrees, or going to their second-choice\nuniversities, because of a decision about\ndebt - rather than a decision about what\nthey could achieve.\nIf that happens it would counteract\nenormous amounts of effort that have\ngone into widening participation in science and engineering, and exacerbate\nexisting inequalities. It\u2019s important we\nmake sure that the overriding concern\nfor applicants is their own academic\nmerit and drive, not a subject-specific\nfinancial trade-off.\nScience has always benefited from diversity - we shouldn\u2019t lose sight of that.\nIt\u2019s in difficult times that we need innovation the most.\nUniversity funding reforms fail in one crucial respect.\nThe evidence for this is right here at Imperial College\nIt\u2019s informative that students, of all the victims of the coalition\u2019s cuts, are the first to\nstand up for themselves, instead of blithely\naccepting the extreme austerity of the current parliament. The growing sense that older generations have used up all the hot wa-ter, so to speak, has created a great sense\nof injustice amongst young people. Add to\nthis the coming Lib Dem betrayal, of their\nelection pledge to vote against tuition fee\nincreases, and it\u2019s easy to understand why\n50,000 students marched on Wednesday.\nBoots on the ground alone are not enough\nto win arguments. Move away from emotive\naccusations of abandoning a generation and\nit quickly becomes clear that the government\u2019s proposals are the fairest solution to\na difficult problem.\nSomeone has to pay for higher education.\nEither society in general, when the government taxes the population, or the individual\nwho directly benefits. There is no need to resort to demagoguery; this ideological point\nis the essential difference between, say, the\nN.U.S. and the government.\nSo in this time of severe financial auster-ity, when each and every area of government\nspending is being reviewed, why should the\ngeneral population bear the costs of giving\na select few an advantage in life? The crucial point is while the state cannot bear the\ncost of the higher education system, the in-dividual, through the tuition fee system, can\nand should.\nBecause ultimately student debt is only as\nscary as the N.U.S. makes it out to be. If\nyou remember that you\u2019ll pay a relatively\nlow amount of interest, that the debt will be\nwiped off after 30 years and that nobody is\ngoing to repossess your home then actually\nit is a pain free way of paying for the best\nyears of your life. If however you believe the\nscaremongering slogan of \u201ccrippling debts\u201d\nthen of course you will be deterred from\nuniversity.\nAs more and more people attend university,\nthe state is grows less and less able to foot\nthe bill. It is obvious that individuals should\nshoulder the costs of that which directly\nbenefits them. The real problem with the\ncurrent tuition fee debate is that young people are being choked by the smoke produced\nby the N.U.S. when there\u2019s no fire to actually\nburn them.\nFELIX\nImran Khan\nHave your say on\nthis article at\nfelixonline.co.uk\nThe act of protest is\nadmirable,but higher fees\nmake sense\nWhen the only woman on campus walks past, it\u2019s easy to spot the guy with a girlfriend\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nDirector of the\nCampaign for Science\nand Engineering and\nImperial College\nalumnus\n\u201c\n\u201c\nt, it\u2019s easy to spot\n\u201d\nScience has always benefited\nfrom diversity - we shouldn\u2019t\nlose sight of that.

    "content": "TRAVEL\nFELIX Friday 12 NOVEMber 2010 37\nWhilst recognising the importance of reminiscence, Chris Richardson examines\nthe brighter side of some of the world\u2019s top remembrance destinations\nLest we forget to find a balance\n\u201cEmbracing such darker\nelements of a culture is\noften what separates\ntravelling from tourism\u201d\nOne of Poland\u2019s oldest cities, this glistening metropolis is home to some beautiful architecture, a\nbooming nightlife and some fantastic eateries. It\u2019s\nonly a short drive from Auschwitz, and most hotels\nwill organise transits and tours for you for a negligible cost. I still speak to people who have visited\nthe city and haven\u2019t done the Auschwitz tour, the\nreasons for which are just beyond me.\nThe tours are tasteful and the area has been very\nwell preserved from tourist rot: the tours keep to-the-point and the lack of a resident gift shop is\nsomewhat pleasing. Certain parts of Auschwitz I\nand II-Birkenau are included on tours that are ran\nby knowledgeable guides who were doing an excellent job from what I could tell. Auschwitz is\ndefinitely one of those cases where reading a book\nor watching a documentary will pale in insignificance to standing there. It\u2019s certainly an eerie feeling walking through a place that is a symbol for\nsuch atrocities.\nBack in Krakow many options await you. One\nof my highlights was sampling honey vodka and\nplum brandy at the Wieliczka salt mine, which\nincludes an entire chapel carved out of rock salt.\nWhile seemingly standard it\u2019s a very impressive\ndisplay. Drift through the Old City at night and see\nthe impressive evening lights bounce off the town\nhall tower, gaze at the town\u2019s many churches and\nsquares, and see Wawel Castle, one of Europe\u2019s\nmost beautiful castles.\nIf you\u2019re a morning person be sure to check out\none of the flea markets, or for the night owls among\nyou check out the reasonably-priced cocktail bars\nand clubs like Cien which pump out endless house.\nThe point is that it\u2019s a great city with lots happen-ing, and a great stop-off for anyone who is inter-railing or in the area for whatever reason.\nVietnam is by far my favourite destination and Saigon was the first place on my hit list as I made my\nway up the coast to the China border. This urban\nsprawl is littered with telephone cables and posters\ndepicting the revered Ho Chi Minh, and if the sea\nof motorbikes doesn\u2019t knock you off your feet the\nstench of durian fruit certainly will.\nSouth Vietnam in particular suffered heavily during the war with the US, the damages of which can\nstill be seen by the births of children with physical\ndeformities and mental retardation due to prenatal\nchemical exposure.\nThe War Remnants Museum has several exhibits\nranging from plain interesting to shocking, outlining the events and consequences of a devastating\nwar.\nThe Cu Chi tunnels are a network of 250km of\nunderground tunnels that were occupied by South\nVietnamese during the war: many people were\npermanent residents \u2013 some even got married and\ngave birth there. You can still enter the tunnels to\nget a glimpse of what life would have been like,\nand trust me, five minutes of claustrophobia is\nmore than enough.\nHop on a bike and hit up some of the parks and\nmarkets on offer, in particular the Russian market\nwhere you can filter through the replica garbage\nand find some genuine war memorabilia, Zippos\nand the like. Have a couple of shots of snake wine\n(great for impotence, apparently) and hit up the\ncity at night \u2013 the street food is not to be missed,\nnor are the manic night markets and pumping bars.\nAnd did I mention that Vietnamese bin collection trucks sound like our ice cream vans? Saigon\nis such a great place to begin or wrap up your Vietnamese journey \u2013 there\u2019s a reason it\u2019s a focal point\non the Asian backpacker circuit.\nOh, you\u2019re hopping between Cambodia and Vietnam and stuck in this hole for 2 hours while you\nwait for your bus transfer? Shit, isn\u2019t life a bitch at\ntimes? I\u2019m really not sure why this place has such\na dire reputation on the good ol\u2019 tourist trail, or\nperhaps I just continually chatted with the wrong\nsort of people. Hell, I loved it and stayed there way\nbeyond the call of duty even after my \u2019nam visa\nstarted ticking!\nPol Pol\u2019s brutal regime was responsible for the\ndeath of 21% of Cambodia\u2019s entire population,\nbut despite this grim statistic he\u2019s often missed out\nof conversation. Phnom Penh is home to both the\nTuol Sleng Genocide Museum and the Choeung\nEk Killing Fields, the former of which is a school\nturned detention centre turned museum, and the\nlatter of which has recently been privatised, much\nto the outrage of the Cambodians whose relatives\nthe fields commemorate. Both offer a thoughtful\ninsight into the problems Cambodia has faced in\nthe past and now faces as a result of such horrific\nevents.\nThe clich\u00e9 of the \u2018contradictions of Cambodia\u2019\ncertainly didn\u2019t spawn from nowhere \u2013 Phnom\nPenh\u2019s streets are a bizarre mix of the extremes:\npoor children missing limbs playing alongside\nwealthy businessmen in suits. Such contrasts can\nbe seen in just about everything in the city, which\ncertainly has a great deal of life to it. The Royal\nPalace has all of Thailand\u2019s wondrous infrastructure but without the incessant hailing to the oh-so\nwise king, which was certainly welcomed.\nGrab a cheap hostel overlooking the lake and\nkick back with a massage, go for a cruise up the\nmighty Mekong, and chow down with a classic fish\namok curry \u2013 include this awesome place on your\nroute more than just a stopover, you won\u2019t regret it.\nW\nith Remembrance Day just behind us it seems appropriate to\ndraw in some of the more sombre elements of travel destina-tions. As a traveller you often\nconfront the tensions of the place you\u2019re visiting,\nthough this will of course vary by destination. I\nthink embracing such darker elements of a culture\nis often what separates travelling from tourism:\nyou\u2019re interested in the lifestyle and not just sporting your token \u2018peace fingers\u2019 pose for your prized\nphoto with the big Buddha statue.\nMy latest Southeast Asian jaunt as a case in\npoint: although I\u2019d read about some of the problems from the Lonely Planet and heard the tales I\ncouldn\u2019t really get a grasp of it until I actually vis-ited. The countless number of landmine victims in\nCambodia is frankly shocking, as are the slightly\nmore subtle cases of Agent Orange deformities\nthroughout Vietnam. While poverty is certainly\nan eye-opener, such atrocities get you to think that\nlittle bit more.\nThat\u2019s not to say that it\u2019s morbidly depressing to\nwitness such circumstances, and in fact once you\nrack up your own little anecdotes and experiences\nit adds a great flavour to your travels. One time in\nSouth Vietnam I decided that it\u2019d be a great idea to\ndo some manic off-road biking with an empty fuel\ntank, and needless to say I found myself stranded\npretty quickly. Thankfully a war veteran and his\nson were out fishing and stopped to fill me up and\neven handed me a bottle of water on account of my\nprobably sweaty face. Absolute heroes.\nAs I\u2019ve now nagged several times (and will continue to do so for years to come) in true self-righ-teous travel writer fashion: some of the people you\nmeet have encountered hell, yet are still infinitely\nhospitable and upbeat.\nWhile Remembrance Day was founded to remember the lives lost in the Great War, the remembrance has been greatly expanded to allow\nus a pause for thought for conflicts everywhere, of\nwhich there sadly are and have been far too many.\nI\u2019m going to share a few places I\u2019ve recently visited that often present taboo in conversation because\nof the darker events they\u2019re often associated with.\nThe aim is to show you the important must-see\nremembrance-based activities in these places while\nalso drawing in some of the lighter things, too: If\nyou\u2019re ever in the vicinity of these locations I hope\nthat you don\u2019t become hesitant at the mere utterance of the place, and instead embrace them with\nopen arms as destinations that really do have something valuable to offer.\nKrak\u00f3w, Poland Saigon, Vietnam Phnom Penh, Cambodia\nKrak\u00f3w\u2019s Old Town, Saigon\u2019s skyline (right, above) and downtown Phnom Penh (right, below)\nPhoto by Richard Sandwell Photo by Chris Richardson\nPhoto by Mahar Usman\n\n"

Representing\nImperial were three full teams. In foil:\nImperial 1st with Ed Collier, Chris Gilliam, Outi Supponen and Robert Shaw.\nIn epee: Imperial 1st consisting of Ed\nGilhead, Marcello Columbino and Miles\nGandolfi and Imperial 2nd with Thorsten Hamann, Charlotte Levin and Peter\nCronbach. In both weapons, we had previous year\u2019s results to defend, gold for\nthe foil team and silver for epee.\nIn the epee, Imperial 1st won all their\nmatches in the first round without much\ntrouble, while in the foil Imperial 1st\nalso kept their level high with the same\nresult. Imperial 2nd epee lost one out\nof three matches and won the rest with\na comforting margin. All teams easily\nqualified for the quarterfinal knock-out\nrounds.\nIn the quarterfinal draw for the epee,\nImperial 1st were faced once again with\na young ULU team they had met in the\nfirst round and Imperial 2nd was up\nagainst a team called \u201c+39\u201d, a hint that\nthe entire team originated from Italy.\nImperial 2nd unfortunately had to admit themselves defeated by the skilled\nItalians. Happily the sad faces did not\nlast for long as Imperial 1 methodically\nmade their way to the final, convincingly beating +39 in the semis. In the\nfinal they faced Brixton, a strong team\nof young fencers. The match was even,\nswaying back and forth all the way to\nthe last period where Imperial showed\nthe value of experience and keeping\ntheir nerves under control to win the\nmatch and clinch gold.\nMeanwhile, in another hall, the foil\nteam was presenting results similar to\nthe first team epeeists. They cruised their\nway to victory in both quarterfinal and\nsemi-final, but were defeated in the final by Salle Paul EU, a very strong team\nfrom one of the country\u2019s top clubs. This\nwas a small let down compared to last\nyear, when they had won gold, but they\nat least had the honour to have the President of British Fencing, Keith Smith, as\na referee in the last match. When we\nleft the hall at the end of the day, after\nprize ceremony and high-fives, we were\nall tired but happy enough to enjoy the\ndelights of Halloween.\nCharlotte Levin\nImperial fencers return with\nmedals of two metals\nImperial\u2019s Marcello Columbino on piste at the London Team Trophy tournament, held at St Paul\u2019s School\n\n"

The\ncompetition was open to medics\nand non-medics alike, with about\na hundred people competing to\nrepresent ICMSU.\nThe medics enjoy the relaxed atmosphere at the Reynolds, many\nseeing it as a \u2018home away from\nThe winning Medic team will go up against the other faculties on the 22nd of November\nNEWS\nUnion lobby EEE department to ensure that PhD students get fair deal\nSenior figures in the Department of\nElectrical and Electronic Engineering\nhave begun concerted efforts to ensure\nthat postgraduate students understand\nthe circumstances under which they are\npaid for teaching duties, introducing a\npotential new measure to reduce the current bursary and have students explicitly\nearn their lost money.\nAs reported by Felix last month, postgraduate students in the department\nfound themselves confused over whether\ntheir funding included payment for teaching work, a matter that was further complicated by the various types of bursary\navailable, whether from Imperial College\nLondon itself or from outside sources\nsuch as the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC).\nA statement was issued last week to\nall postgraduate students, regardless\nof funding type, by Director of Postgraduate Studies Dr Patrick Naylor,\nfurther clarifying the situation in order\nto overcome any discrepancies in prior\ninformation. The Head of Department,\nProfessor Peter Cheung, had previously\nadmitted to Felix that the postgraduate\nacceptance letter detailing their requirements for teaching work \u201cwasn\u2019t clear\u201d\nin communicating the relevant information to students.\nThe main aim of the new information\nwas the announcement that \u2018payment for\nteaching must be separated from the student stipend explicitly\u2019. The department\ngoes on to explain the two reasons for\nthis; the fact that earnings for teaching\nmust, by law, be paid through the College and that EPSRC stipends should\nnot be used to pay for teaching. It is also\nstated that these new changes have been\nretroactively introduced from the beginning of this term.\nThe funding provided by College will\nnow be \u2018split into two elements\u2019. The first\nis a college bursary which \u2018may be adjusted to remove any element implicitly\nor explicitly associated with teaching\u2019.\nThe second is teaching work, which \u2018will\nbe paid through the College\u2019s payroll system at the published hourly rates\u2019.\nA meeting was organised last Friday\nfor postgraduate students to voice their\nopinions on the matter. Imperial College\nUnion President Alex Kendall was also\nin attendance. He spoke to Felix about\nthe proceedings while also discussing\npossible plans that the department may\nimplement.\nHe explained the adjustment to the\nCollege bursary; prior to the confusion,\naround \u00a3700 was added onto the normal\ncollege-funded stipend of approximately\n\u00a315,000 to cover the cost of teaching du-ties. However, the issue was raised that\nthere weren\u2019t enough teaching hours to\ncover the desired \u20184 hours a week\u2019 for\neach student to undertake.\nKendall was impressed, however, by\nsome ideas from students in attendance\nhoping to overcome the issues: \u201cThere\nwas a good suggestion put forward by a\nPhD student that the department should\nprovide an extra \u00a3700 to the college-provided bursary. As soon as a student\nearns more than this \u00a3700 through extra\nteaching, then they would get paid for\nthe extra teaching that they provide. The\ndepartment went away thinking about\nthe idea. Potentially it\u2019s great for students.\u201d\nStudents agree, according to Kendall, stating that those present \u201cappeared\nhappy with this idea\u201d. However, any\npotential introduction of an idea formulated at the meeting may only account\nfor this academic year, with there being\na high chance that the additional sum for\nteaching will then be removed. Students\nwould be paid for any teaching duties\nthey perform through the College\u2019s payroll system.\nStaff behind the funding changes have\nremained tight-lipped over potential\nfuture changes, with Dr Naylor stating\nthat he would be \u201cvery happy\u201d to discuss\nwhat funding will change but not \u201cuntil\nwe have finished our consultation process and finalised all the details.\u201d\nMatt Colvin\nThe first Athletics Club Committee\n(ACC) Bar Night of the year took place\non Wednesday 3rd November, raising\nover \u00a31000 for various sporting clubs,\nwith the success being hailed as the beginning of \u201ca new age for the Union\u201d.\nA turnout of 600 people helped put the\nnewly opened FiveSixEight bar to the\ntest with a record 27 kegs being served\nin under 2 hours; the fact that there was\ndamage caused to the men\u2019s toilets did\nnot deter attendees from finishing off all\nof the beer and cider on offer.\nThe profit made will be recirculated to\nACC clubs, which this year have all suffered budget cuts.\nACC Chair, Monya Zard gave her\nthanks to all the clubs attending and\nsaid \u201cwe are looking forward to the next\nevent where we can test out the capabili-ACC Bar Night\nbrings \u00a31,000 profit\nhome\u2019. As the Hammersmith campus is quite far from the main South\nKensington campus, most medics\nfind that they spend their free time\nsocialising at the Reynolds. The\nrecently refurbished bar is aptly\ndecorated with stolen signs from\nother medical schools to give it a\nwarm and welcoming effect (though\nwhether King\u2019s College share this\nview is debatable). Although there\nwas much intra team rivalry, with\nsome even threatening to \u2018bludgeon to death\u2019 fellow team members for incorrect answers, all\ncompetitors enjoyed themselves\nwhile raising a fair amount for\nRAG Week charities.

Although\nnever outright rude, his smile is utterly offensive to\nthe guards, though, however much you try, you cannot replicate it yourself.\nLuke\u2019s escalating masochistic refusal to be broken by the prison guards makes for very uncomfortable viewing. Yes, we don\u2019t want him to be beaten\nby the system, but it is increasingly apparent that\nwith every quip he is only digging himself deeper \u2013\nliterally, as he is forced to spend whole days and\nnights digging and refilling trenches.\nThere are plenty of films with rebellious lead char-acters, so what makes Cool Hand Luke so special?\nI\u2019ll limit it to three things: it\u2019s Paul Newman (need I\nsay more?); it features a series of beautifully shot\nscenes of the men of the chain gang working; and\na final fifteen minutes of unbearable excitement.\nMark Bruggemann\nNewman - making cholesterol cool since 1967\nFilm Editors: Jade Hoffman\nMatt Allinson\nEd Knock\nfilm.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nDirectors Shelly Lee Davies and Or Shlomi\nare new to filmmaking. In an after-screening\nQ&A they revealed that this endeavour was\none which they carried out largely alone and\nwith what appeared to be little past experience;\nsuffice it to say that it did show. Although the\ncontent of this film speaks volumes, the editing\nand camerawork left something to be desired,\nespecially when compared to The Cove, An\nInconvenient Truth, Fahrenheit 911, or in fact\nmany of the eye-opening \u201cdocufilms\u201d which\nhave so thrillingly educated us in the past.\nThis film is not a blockbuster; it is not an artistically shot, hard hitting, expos\u00e9 of scandalous issues, unfairly hidden from the deserving\npublic; PLANEAT is a genuine educative expe-rience. In the Q&A the directors suggest that it\nwas not their intention to make a blockbuster,\nthey make their impact in a different, more subtle way. PLANEAT doesn\u2019t thrill and excite by\nexposing the seedy realities of the workings of\nthe meat industry. They shock by simply reassessing what we all \u201csort of\u201d knew anyway. I\u2019ll\nbet a lot of people know that a meat based diet\nis more environmentally damaging than plant\nbased alternatives, but how many know that\neating a diet based on chicken is more eco-savvy than vegetarianism? This film informs\nyou of the science behind the everyday, common titbit of dietary knowledge that so many\nlive by.\nvores, and it casts a different light to counter\nthe commonly-held view of vegetables as rabbit food.\nIt is, however, just one small section of a very\nbroad problem of colliding interests, cultures\nand industries. Davis and Shlomi stress this\npoint in the Q&A, making it clear that the argument of health and environment is by no means\nthe final word in the problems of Western diet\nand disease. An issue that isn\u2019t covered in this\ndocumentary, and is probably one of interest, is\nthe fact that a lot of the foods promoted in it are\npretty expensive. In one interview, they film a\nrestaurant owner demonstrating how to make\na meat-free roast and soup, chopping a squash\non his marble kitchen counter or browsing for\nfresh ingredients in Whole Foods. The issue\nof processed foods is only really ever seen as\na bad choice made by nameless heart disease\nsufferers, not as a product of convenience and\nculture. When they film Professor Gidon Eshel\nstrolling through a sustainable organic farm,\nthey don\u2019t really take into account that not everyone can go down to the wholesome village\nmarket and buy seasonal lettuces grown down\nthe road.\nThroughout the film, the personal lives of\nthe three key figures are gently dipped into;\nenough to make you associate with them and\nyet not so much that the spotlight is taken from\nthe science. Small sections filmed within Dr\nEsselstyn\u2019s home, showing the idiosyncratic\nlittle relationship he shares with his frankly\nwonderfully eccentric wife, provide some of\nmy favorite moments, giving a lightness and\nhumor to an already very good natured docu-mentary. It is this affable approach that sets\nOur survey says: 8 out of 10 cows prefer not to be eaten\niCU Cinema - Scott Pilgrim vs. The World\n\u00a33/\u00a34 for members/non-members\nTue 16th Nov. 6:30pm.\nUnion Concert Hall\nEVENTS\nDirector Shelley Lee Davis, Or Shlomi\nNarrator Yvonne O\u2019Grady\nPLANEAT\nNoah Baker\nJade Hoffman\nFriday 12 November 2010\n\u201cThey don\u2019t thrill by\n\u2018uncovering\u2019 the meat\nindustry.

In a move that\nreally reflects the film\u2019s demographic, the closing titles encourage the audience to now go and\nlog on with their phones to sign up for email\nupdates and recipes - cue mobile phone inferiority complexes, though still a nice touch. The\nwebsite also includes links to the scientists interviewed throughout the film, allowing you to\nlook further at their work \u2013 another nice touch\nfor a documentary that looks at fostering personal changes rather than a blanket approach to\nWestern consumption.\nThe annual Screen Green! festival has presented some very thought-provoking documentaries that may not get all that much widespread attention, but do certainly hold some\nrelevance to what goes on here at Imperial.\nThis festival provides a platform for films that\nmay otherwise have difficulty getting seen or\npublicised, and has put on another varied and\ninsightful programme of quality documentaries\nfrom all over Europe.\nPLANEAT is out now on limited release, with\nselected screenings at the Marble Arch Ritz\nand Odeon Wembley.

    "content": "NEWS\nFELIX\n8\nNews Editors: Matt Colvin\nAlex Karapetian\nnews.felix@imperial.ac.uk\no ifs, no buts, no education cuts.\u201d This was the\nchant carried through London last Wednesday by fifty thousand students and lecturers, in protest against the government\u2019s plans to raise the cap on tuition fees to \u00a39,000.\nThe rally, organised by the National Union of Students and\nthe University and College Union, highlights a major issue\nfacing universities in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland.\nSpending cuts to higher education have been introduced to\nreduce the country\u2019s budget deficit. While many students\nat the protest agreed that spending cuts must be brought\nin, there was strong opposition to this measure. \u201cBritain\u2019s\neconomy is supported by its intellectual reputation,\u201d said\none student from Cambridge at the demonstration. \u201cThe\nuse of tuition fees to cover unnecessary cuts to education\nis ideologically motivated, not driven by economic need.\u201d\nDeputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg maintains that the proposed system will be fair to poor and disadvantaged stu-dents. \u201cThe proposals we have put forward will mean that\nthose who earn the least will pay much less than they do\nat the moment,\u201d he insisted in Parliament on Wednesday.\nBright sunshine provided a fitting backdrop to the mood of\nexcitement which dominated the early part of the day. The\nprotesters\u2019 anger was largely muted by a comforting feeling\nof unity, inspired by the sheer size of the demonstration.\nSlogans were chanted and placards were brandished, but\nthere was no sign of aggression between police officers and\nprotesters. A few kind protesters even shared their food\nwith policemen. At the Tate Britain, a National Union of Students bus with radio and television equipment blared messages over the crowds with loudspeakers. The messages\nthey played, like the students they were played to, varied\ngreatly in fervency, ideology, and hostility. Yet they were\ngreeted with thunderous chanting from the demonstrators,\nsharing a united opposition to the government\u2019s proposal.\nWhat was almost entirely a peaceful demonstration was\nmarred by violence at the Conservative Party Headquarters\nat Millbank House. Who the perpetrators were is uncertain,\nbut about 200 people stormed the building, overrunning the\nsmall police presence and smashing windows on their way\nin. At 13:30, ideologues with megaphones campaigned outside the building, shouting, \u201cThis is the Tory Headquarters!\nWe must barricade them in their offices, we must blockade\nthem in the streets!\u201dMasked anarchists were seen at the\nforefront of the attack, and activists handing out anarchist\nliterature were scattered around the area. Police regained\ncontrol of the building at 17:00, arresting 35. The hostility\nhas provoked firm condemnation from student leaders and\nstudents alike, being branded \u2018despicable\u2019, and \u2018barbaric\u2019.\nIt was a day of unity for the demonstrators. The future\nfor the next generation of graduates lies shrouded in de-tail, ideology, economics, and political manoeuvring, but at\nleast one thing is a clear fact: the voices of fifty thousand\nstudents came to London in protest. Whether or not they\nwere heard by the government is a question indeed.\nN\nSTUDENTS\nTAKE TO THE\nSTREETS\nPhoto by Miles Robertson Photo by Miles Robertson\nPhoto by Miles Robertson\nby John Wheatley\nFriday 12 NOVEMBER 2010\n\n"

Really nice guys, both\nincredibly talented and also very down to earth.\nAfter nailing down an exquisite series of acoustic\nversions of their punky, indie, catchy tunes, they\nthen had a couple of pints with us in the Union\nafterwards.\nI think that is the main reason we do these ses-sions, because it is a great chance to get to know\nthe rock stars of tomorrow while they\u2019re still \u201cnormal\u201d! We don\u2019t get many pre-Madonnas, just people that want to come and show off the thing that\nthey love and work hard for.\nThe most recent session that we have done was\nwith an Icelandic singer called Hafdis Huld, who\nhas been played very frequently on 6Music and\nBBC Radio 2. She\u2019s a beautiful singer with an\namazing personality and someone that is destined\nto become big news. What is it about Iceland and\nmusic?!\nRedtrack played four tracks for us (Cigarette,\nCatch Me Out, The Trier and Been There), Hafdis Huld played three (K\u00f3ngul\u00f3, I Almost Know\nA Criminal and Synchronized Swimmers).

Resulting in one of the best records Eno has made this\ndecade that will surely stand beside his masterpieces from the 70\u2019s and 80\u2019s. Inspired by the sound of\nmovie soundtracks, Eno and his equally nutjob multi-instrumentalist friends Jon Hopkins and Leo Abrahams have crafted the beautiful score to an imaginary\nSci-Fi epic, reminiscent of Eno\u2019s contribution to the\n`Dune\u2019 soundtrack. What we have here are sound-scapes, rather than songs, that generate visual images of a distant barren land, a deserted alien planet.\nThere\u2019s the odd burst of frantic guitar noise, invigorating the mix. It rivals only Trent Reznor\u2019s \u201cSocial\nNetwork\u201d OST as soundtrack of the year in my mind.\nAlso, the only promotional interview Eno has done for\nthis album so far is with Dick Flash of Pork Magasine,\nwho is actually just Eno in a wig.

Tickets are going for around the \u00a3100\nmark and rising on ebay. But as with all things, quality costs. Kadhim Shubber\nI\nn this, my second instalment\nof Techno Nonsense, a feature\ndedicated to highlighting the big\nplayers in electronic dance music\nright now, I\u2019m going to hit you\nwith Night Slugs.\nTraversing the entire length of the musical spectrum from last week\u2019s Disco\nfeature, Night Slugs is one of the hottest labels in the UK right now and I\u2019m\ndefinitely not the first, nor will I be the\nlast, person this year to sing their praises.\nIt\u2019s hard to tie Night Slugs down into a\ngenre, as all of their releases so far have\nbeen fresh and hugely varied. In fact\nwhen asked about their \u2018sound\u2019, Night\nSlugs co-founder James Connolly, AKA\nL-Vis 1990, stated in no uncertain terms\nthat \u201cformulas are shit and we don\u2019t want\nthem, so that\u2019s why we don\u2019t do them.\u201d\nConnolly runs the label with South\nLondon based DJ, producer, graphic designer and all around media boss, Alex\nSushon AKA Bok Bok. Like most exciting new movements in music, the Night\nSlugs idea developed from disenchantment with both the UK grime scene\nand the club scene in general. Initially\ncontacting each other via MySpace, the\ntwo got together and started putting on\nparties in Camberwell in 2008.\nThe party later moved to Old Street\nbut it wasn\u2019t until this year that the label\nitself was christened with the release of\nMosca\u2019s, fittingly titled, \u201cSquare One\u201d\nEP in January. Since then Night Slugs\nhas released 8 EPs, all of unfaltering\nquality \u2013 an impressive feat and the\nreason Connolly and Sushon are finding huge praise flung at them from all\ndirections.\nJoin in at: http://www.last.fm/group/Felix+Music\nTECHNO\nNONSENSE\nPt. 2: Simon Hunter continues\nhis tour of the electronic realm\nwith London\u2019s Night Slugs\nAs I have already alluded to, describing a typical Night Slugs release is\npretty difficult, as there simply isn\u2019t one.\nStaccato percussion, sparse 8-bit synthesisers and deconstructed R&B vocal\nsamples all make appearances, creating\nbeats as diverse as Girl Unit\u2019s haunting\nmasterpiece \u201cShade On\u201d to Lil Silva\u2019s\nruthlessly funky \u201cNight Skanker\u201d. One\nfeature common to all of the releases,\nhowever, is the use of sub-bass which\ntransforms songs that sound pretty bare\non normal speakers into a full-blown onslaught on the dance floor.\nIn addition to songs recommended in\nthe previous paragraph, check out Kingdom\u2019s \u201cThis Mystic\u201d and Girl Unit\u2019s\n\u201cWut\u201d; both eerie and hard-hitting in\nequal measures.

    "content": "grainy picture pops up in\nfront of me. It\u2019s an unimpressive sight. On the\nright of the picture a simple question pops up, \u201cIs\nthe galaxy simply smooth and rounded,\nwith no sign of a disk?\u201d I\u2019m given 3 op-tions; I click the one which best suits the\nblob in front of me. I answer a couple\nmore questions and that\u2019s it, I\u2019ve officially classified a galaxy.\nIt\u2019s simple and requires only a basic\namount of decision making; I am in disbelief that people spend hours of their\nday doing it. However, half an hour later\nI am still classifying galaxies; moving\nquickly through the less impressive,\nblob-like ones in search of the elaborate\nones, the beautiful ones, and the weird\nones. My essay is going to suffer for the\ndiscovery of Galaxy Zoo!\nGalaxy Zoo is phenomenally success-ful. To date it has published over a dozen\npapers in science journals! The Zooniverse team behind Galaxy Zoo, Moon\nZoo, and many more have successfully\nbroken down complex tasks in an engaging format that draws people in and\nallows them to generate data for scientific research.\nI get a chance to talk to talk to Rob\nSimpson, a member of the Zooniverse\nteam. With a background in astronomy,\nhe tells me how he enjoys being part of\na different sort of science, a step away\nfrom the normal academic research\npath, and working in the exciting, growing area of citizen science.\nOne thing is puzzling me; why do\npeople even give up their time for\nsomething they don\u2019t even get a credit\nfor? Rob explains that a survey was\ndone of Galaxy Zoo participants and\nproduced results that even he is sceptical of. Out of the various options fellow\ngalaxy classifiers could have picked,\nthe most common one was that they\nfelt like that they are contributing to\nsomething. \u201cHard to believe, but true,\u201d\nRob tells me with real disbelief in his\nvoice. He explains that, \u201cThere is a real\ngaming aspect [to the different zoos]\u201d.\nIt plays on people\u2019s hobbies and adds\na, perhaps unintentional, competitive\ntwist.\nThe beauty is that there is real mutual\nlearning; the public gets to explore the\ndifferent types of galaxies out in the far\nreaches of space, while the scientists get\nvital data.\nGalaxy Zoo is part of a growing number of research projects using volunteers\nto generate data, known as citizen sci-ence. Some people believe that this is\njust crowd sourcing; an out sourcing of\ndata collection to members of the public.\nRob believes that Zooniverse is not as it\n\u201ctries to engage with people.\u201d There are\nforums where people can discuss their\nfindings. These discussions platforms\nhave even led to new discoveries, such\nas the intriguingly named Hanny\u2019s Voorwerp! This was spotted by a zoo mem-ber, Hanny van Arkel, a number of years\nago and is now thought to be a portion\nof a gas-cloud, heated by the jet from a\nblack hole!\nInteresting discussion have arisen\nfrom other \u2018zoos\u2019. Their latest project,\nOld Weather, asks people to transcribe\nmeticulous weather records from ships\nlog books into databases. Boring? Maybe. But as well as looking at the weather\ndata, people are able to track the journey of the ship around the globe and\nget to know the daily lives of the sailors on board. In the Old Weather forum\npeople post comments such as, \u201cIt all\nfeels like it\u2019s happening there and then\nwhen you\u2019re working through the logs.\nIt\u2019s a nice way of keeping their memories alive.\u201d And more touchingly, when\npeople have encountered a death aboard\nthe ship, \u201cNot the kind of thing I want\nto just ignore - it\u2019s like I need to mourn\ntheir deaths again for myself.\u201d\nOn the other hand, the forums do give\npeople interested in conspiracy theories\na platform to air their views. Although\nreluctant to give specific details, Rob\ntells me that people do use moon zoo to\nsearch the moon\u2019s surface for evidence\nof a moon base while others scour the\nskies for evidence of UFOs. None have\nbeen found to date.\nThere is real value in citizen science\nprojects such as these. Firstly the sheer\nscale of information that can be gathered from the public. Because they have\nno preconceived ideas about what the\ngalaxies should be, they serve as more\nobjective observers. \u201cPeople can do\nthings computers can\u2019t,\u201d Rob explains.\nIn the case of Galaxy Zoo, a computer\ncannot carry out the same detailed visual identification that a person can. The\namount of people carrying out this identification allows an average closer to the\ntrue result to be obtained and irons our\nFELIX Friday 12 NOVEMBER 2010 7\nINTERVIEW\nSURFING\nTHE ZOONIVERSE\nLizzie Crouch chats to Rob Simpson and gets\naddicted to galaxy classification as she tries her\nhand at citizen science\nany deliberate errors or differences in\nopinion.\nAn interesting discussion is about\nthe role of citizen science has recently\nappeared recently on the blog of Imperial lecturer, Professor Alice Bell. During the course of the discussion Chris\nLinott wrote that \u201cthe broader role of\ncitizen science projects... is to provide\nexamples, places where people can\nsample being an active participant in\nscience.\u201d Does this suggest that citizen\nscience can bridge the gap between scientists and the public, and engage them\non a new level? Something to think\nabout!\nSo what\u2019s the future for Galaxy Zoo?\nRob\u2019s currently working on a project\nwhich is a bit of pet of his. When he\njoined Galaxy Zoo earlier this year he\nsuggested that he might develop a new\nzoo which plays on his background. Using infrared data from space telescopes\nparticipants will be invited to draw\nwhere they see bubbles of space dust;\nwork which will be hopefully generate\ndata on how stars form. Sounds intrigu-ing, but in the meantime I am still sat in\nfront of my computer classifying galaxy\nafter galaxy!\n\u201cGalaxy Zoo is part of\na growing number of\nresearch projects using volunteers to generate data, known as\ncitizen science\u201d\nPhoto by Tom Welch\nBig science projects can generate\nthousands of gigabytes of data per\nday. For most of these projects\ncomputers can process the data\nand give meaningful results quickly\nand efficiently.\nHowever for certain data, such\nas images, humans are just better at spotting certain trends than\ncomputers. Zooniverse is a citizen\nscience portal which allows the\ngeneral public to do these tasks\nand be part of a real research proj-ect, much like \u2018SETI@home\u2019 in the\nlate 1990\u2019s.\nCurrent projects which can be\naccessed from the Zooniverse include the aforementioned \u2018Galaxy\nzoo\u2019, \u2018Old Weather\u2019-a project to\nrecover and analyse weather observations from around the world\nrecorded in log books of Royal\nNavy members around the time of\nWorld War 1,\n\u2018Moonzoo\u2019-a project to record\ncraters of the moon in depth from\ndata recoded by a NASA lunar or-biter, and much more.\nZooniverse can be found at www.\nzooniverse.org.\nWhat is\nZooniverse?\nA\n\n"
