    "content": "Last month, Felix was asked,\namongst other student-run\nnewspapers, to express support\nfor Harry\u2019s Law. The request was\nmade by the student newspaper at\nthe University of Exeter, Exepos\u00e9.\nHarry\u2019s Law was created by the\nparents of Harry Armstrong Evans, an\nExeter student who took their\nown life in June 2021. The\ncoroners\u2019 report found that\n\u201cthe University of Exeter\nfailed to uphold their\nsafeguarding obligations,\nand missed opportunities\nto help Harry amidst\na period of\npoor academic\nperformance and an\nacute mental health\ncrisis\u201d. Thus, the proposed\nlaw would require coroners\u2019\ncourts to inform universities\nwhen a student dies by suicide.\nAccording to a Samaritans\u2019 website,\ndeaths by suicide are always reported\nto the coroner, and they \u201cwill gather\nevidence and information to help\nthem understand the circumstances\nleading to that suicide\u201d. This\nwould involve getting in contact\nwith the students\u2019 personal tutor,\nor a contact at their university.\nThe law would also require higher\neducation institutions (mainly\nattended by young adults aged 18-24) to provide a duty of care, and for\nuniversities to annually publish the\nnumber and department of student\nsuicides. Deceased people are not\nprotected by data protection laws, and\nas such, their personal information\ncan be shared by institutions.\nNow, the intent of this law is\nto ensure that higher education\ninstitutions can be publicly held to\naccount over their actions surrounding\nstudent wellbeing. However, naming\nthe law based on a person who\nexperienced tragic circumstances is\ncounter-productive. It draws on the\nemotional tie to a high-profile case,\nand anyone who speaks against it is\nautomatically drawn up as callous.\nThe law, no matter how thorough, will\nappear as the ramblings of an incited\ncrowd who must gather\nafter a tragedy, and\n\u201cget something done\nabout this injustice\u201d.\nPublic outrage\nsurrounding a\ntragedy tends to\ndrive public support\nfor a law, and a study\nfound that respondents\nwere 1.61 times more\nlikely to \u201cstrongly support\u201d\na named law than an unnamed one.\nUsually, the tragedy has been\ncaused by a mix of unfortunate\ncircumstances and actions, which were\nnot addressed by current legislation.\nThe law then aims to correct this\nby instituting a broad change that\nmay not necessarily solve the root of\nthe issue. Oftentimes, the proposed\nlaw may have the potential for more\nharm than good through unintended\nconsequences. When it is eventually\nwatered down to something that is\nreasonably enforceable, the proposers\nare undoubtably unhappy, and take\nto the radio waves to express concerns\nthat politicians and lawmakers \u201cdo\nnot care\u201d about the tragedy, using\nemotive language to further their\nargument instead of logical reasoning.\nOf course, based on our editorial\nprinciples, Felix does not have a\npolitical stance, and as such will\nremain neutral regarding the law.\n2\nJamie John DeputyEditor\nSam Lovatt ManagingEditor\nAngie Lo\nChiefScience\nEditor\nTaylor Pomfret ScienceEditorJonah Hewett FilmEditor\nMike Buzadji FilmEditor\nIsabella Ward Copyeditor\nThis issue was produced\nthanks to the work of\nAnd our numerous\ncontributors\nKEEP THE CAT FREE\nEDITORIAL\nFelix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nRethink the names\nFelix Office\nBeit Quad, Prince Consort Road\nLondon, SW7 2BB\nTel: 020 79548072\nEmail: felix@ic.ac.uk\nfelixonline.co.uk\n@feliximperial\nPrinted by Iliffe Media\nWinship Road,\nMilton,Cambridge\nCB24 6PP\nRegistered Newspaper ISSN 1040-0711\nCopyright (c) Felix 2020\nStatement\nof Intent\nAt Felix we believe that it is always\nin the interest of the students to\nknow.

    "content": "FRIDAY 9TH DECEMBER 2022\n3\nFelix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nNEWS\nAir pollution levels at South Kensington\nStation above WHO guidelines, study finds\nAir pollution levels at South Kensington Station were found to have\nexceeded air quality guidelines set by the\nWorld Health Organisation (WHO),\naccording to a new study by a team including members from Imperial\u2019s Department of Materials. \u201cSuch high concentrations represent a health risk to the\nusers and staff of the London Underground\u201d, they report.\nPollution levels were found to increase over the day, peaking at busy\ntimes, and were at their worst between 6pm and 9pm.\nThe researchers\nmonitored the con-centrations, sizes and\nchemical compositions of airborne\nparticles on the eastbound Piccadilly\nline platform (Plat-form 4). They found\nthat the station contained double the\namount of coarse\nair pollution particles (PM2.5-10\n) during\noperating hours,\ncompared with non-operating hours.\nThe team suggested that such particles could find their way to the nose\nand upper parts of the lungs, where\nthey could cause respiratory problems.\nParticulate matter (PM) consists of\nmicroscopic solid particles in the air\nand is considered to be amongst the\nmost harmful forms of air pollution.\n\u201cPM levels in the London underground system are much higher than in\nroadside environments\u201d, the paper says.\n\u201cThese higher levels of particle concentrations in London Underground stations are primarily influenced by ventilation settings, depth and age of the\ntunnels, and are highest in the deepest\nunderground lines. The South Kensington tube station can be considered\na worst-case scenario of exposure given\nthat it is one of the deepest and oldest\nundergroundtrainsystemsintheworld.\u201d\nThe authors found that the smallest\nparticles, which are 1/800th of the size of\nahumanhair,couldreachdeeperregions\nof the lungs, crossing into the bloodstream and \u201ccontributing to adverse cardiovascular and respiratory responses\u201d.\n\u201cThis is the first time the chemistry of\nthe smallest particles, which can go deep\ninto the lung and potentially damage\ncells, has been identified\u201d, said Professor\nAlex Porter, who led electron microscopy analysis of the particles at Imperial College London.\nIn light of their\nfindings, the paper\nencourages the UK\u2019s\nHealth and Safety\nExecutive (HSE) to\nconsider introducing separate lower\nexposure limits for\nsmaller particles.\n\u201cThe HSE limits refer to compounds\nfound in air pollu-tion, and not the\nspecific form/mix-ture of the air pollution we measure\u201d, observed Professor Porter. \u201cHSE guidelines are also\nfor workplace exposure and not for\nthe Underground tube environment.\u201d\nThe authors have stressed the need\nfor further research on the health implications of their work. \u201cIn the mean-time, we recommend that consideration is given to improving ventilation\non the London Underground where\npossible\u201d, said Professor Prashant\nKumar, study lead and Director of\nGCARE at the University of Surrey.\nProfessor Kumar accepted that \u201cair\npollution on platforms is a very complex\nproblem to solve\u201d and that \u201can effort is\nbeing made to clean the Underground\nduring quieter periods\u201d. He pointed to\nthe newly opened Elizabeth line, where\nscreensareplacedbetweentrainandplat-form, as an \u201cexample of good practice\u201d.\nIn a statement to Felix, TfL said it is\ncurrently working with Imperial College London on a separate project to\nunderstand the health impacts of dust\non London Underground workers.\n\u201cSafety is our top priority and we have\nbeen working for many years to reduce\nTubedustandwillcontinuetodoso\u201d,said\nLilli Matson, TfL\u2019s Chief Safety, Health\n& Environment Officer. \u201cOur monitoring has shown that dust levels on the\nTube remain well below limits set by the\nHealth and Safety Executive, but we are\ngoingfurtherandhavedevelopedanum-ber of innovative new cleaning regimes.\u201d\n\u201cThis includes the use of industrial backpack dust cleaners, which\nare one part of our multi-mil-lion-pound Tube cleaning programme.\u201d\n\u201cWe are working with the authors to\nreview the results of their study and to\nensure we fully understand them and\nhow to further reduce the levels further.\u201d\nTfL also noted that \u201cTravel on\nthe London Underground provides\na reduction in exposure to harmful\nsurface traffic pollutants such as nitrogen dioxide and diesel exhaust\nemissions, which are not produced\ninside the Underground network.\u201d\nJamie John Deputy Editor-in-Chief\nIn her response to the research, TfL\u2019s safety chief said: \u201cDust levels on the Tube\nremain well below limits set by the Health and Safety Executive (HSE).\u201d\nIn separate, unrelated comments to Felix, Professor Porter, a co-author of the\njournal paper stated that HSE guidelines are not actually for the Underground:\n\u201cHSE guidelines are for workplace exposure and not for the Underground tube\nenvironment.\u201d\nFelix contacted TfL to ask how the HSE limits are relevant to the Underground,\nand received the following reply:\n\u201cTheHSElimitsarealegalrequirementforustocomplywithandLondonUnderground is well within those limits. DEFRA environmental air quality limits are set\nfor the ambient environment (EU and WHO limits in the same fashion) and are\ntargets/guidelineswithoutanyspecificlegalliabilityforcompliance.Wealsowork\non the principle that HSE limits are set for people working for prolonged periods\nin these environments, whereas our customers are generally passing through.\u201d\nHow relevant are the UK HSE\u2019s limits?\nSOUTH\nKENSINGTON\nSTATION CAN\nBE CONSIDERED\nA WORST-CASE\nSCENARIO OF\nEXPOSURE\n\u201c\nAir pollution at its worst during evening rush hour\nResearchers call for better ventilation and further research on health impacts\nImage credit: Markus Freise\n\n"

Youshouldbeproudofwhoyouare.\u2019\u201d\nWhen a popular studio, such as Marvel, highlights\ndifferent cultures that have been misrepresented or\nunderrepresented by mainstream media, it shows that\nnot only does representation matter, but also how\npeople are represented matters too.\nRiri Williams (played wonderfully by Dominique\nThorne) is thrust into the mix as Tl\u0101l\u014dc\u0101n and\nWakanda both assert power to protect their people.\nWakanda and Tl\u0101l\u014dc\u0101n parallel each other in many\nways, because they are both largely hidden from the\nrest of the world and, more importantly, they both\nwant what is best for their people.

The scene is between Okoye\n(Danai Gurira) and Queen Ramonda, where Okoye\u2019s\nleadership is questioned, and tensions reach an all-time\nhigh. Angela Bassett and Danai Gurira deliver a tour\ndeforceinacting;AngelaBassettislongoverdueforan\nOscar and truly deserves one for this scene alone.\nThe scene is both heartbreaking and reflective on\nboth sides, as you hear the pain and grief in Ramonda\nand Okoye\u2019s voice as they address each other.

In this emotionally charged, family-driven\naction film, we are shown the dangers of letting grief\nconsume us. Through the variety of ways in which the\ncharacters navigate their grief, the film acknolwedges\nthat this is a complex issue.

I found that it means a\nlot.\u201d\n- Chadwick Boseman on the film Black Panther\nThe impact the first Black Panther had was\ninsurmountable, as it was the first high-budget\nsuperhero film with a majority black cast, black\ndirector, and black writer\u2014an absolute milestone\nin the film industry. African culture was celebrated,\nand black communities around the world got to see\nblack superheroes dominate popular culture, allowing\npeople to see themselves in the characters.\nBlack Panther also explored tough\nthemes such as the African diaspora,\nrace, and identity. Chadwick Boseman\nadded: \u201cThere was a time where\npeople would ask me questions about\nwhether an audience could sit\nthrough a movie with a lead character that spoke with\nthat accent... so I became adamant about the fact that\nit\u2019s not true.\u201d This film dominated the box office and\nbroke the preconceived notion that Hollywood films\ncouldn\u2019tthrivewithamajorityblackornon-whitecast.\nOn August 28th, 2020, the whole world was deeply\nsaddened by and shocked to hear of the passing of\nChadwick Boseman. Boseman consistently received\nthehighestpraisefromhisco-starsforallhisworkfrom\n42 to Black Panther to 21 bridges, but he was not only\na superhero in film, but also in real life, championing\nthe need for representation within the film industry as\nwell as supporting cancer organizations. In retrospect,\na newfound appreciation for the film arises when\nyou know Chadwick was battling cancer whilst still\nworking to produce the film; he fought through the\npain and poured every ounce of himself into the film.\nHe was a real-life superhero.\nRyan Coogler and the team had to say farewell\nnot only to T\u2019Challa, but to the actor behind\nhim, who meant so much to the cast and crew.\nThemoviehasastellarcast-TLetitiaWright,\nDanai Gurira, Lupita Nyong\u2019o, Angela Bassett\nandWinstonDukereturn. -butwhatelevates\nthis film is the emotion they show. The pain\nthey feel after T\u2019Challa\u2019s death almost feels\ntoo real for a fictional film. Perhaps what we\nsee is more than just acting - perhaps they\nare mourning the losses of T\u2019Challa and\nChadwick on-screen.\nCostume designer Ruth E. Carter,\ndirector Ryan Coogler, and co-writer\nJoe Robert Cole return. New characters\njoin the cast, including Tenoch Huerta as Namor,\nMabel Cadena as Namora, Alex Livinalli as Attuma,\nMichaela Coel as Aneka, and Dominique Thorne as\nRiri Williams.\nNear the start of the film, throughout T\u2019Challa\u2019s\nfuneral procession, you feel the emotional weight of\nthis scene weighing you down as you see the tears flow\ndown the cast\u2019s faces; it feels deeper as you know those\nare real tears of mourning. With the film being almost\n3 hours long, the writers give time for the characters to\nhandle their grief, from questioning faith and religion\nto questioning their own abilities. Letitia Wright and\nAngela Bassett are phenomenal in this film and really\nmake you hang on every word they say as they learn to\ndeal with the loss of a son and a brother. Shuri (Letitia\nWright) questions her own abilities as her mother\nenquires about her efforts to restore the heart-shaped\nherb (which grants the power of the black panther),\nand she wonders why Bast would bestow abilities on\nher that she could not use to save her brother. Those\nmomentsaretrulypowerful,andthefilmremainswell-paced.\nAfter a time-jump, Queen Ramonda (Angela\nBassett) addresses the UN, as it is discovered that\ncertain countries are trying to retrieve vibranium from\noutside Wakanda. This leads to Wakanda seeing these\nmember states as a threat. From those scenes alone,\nthis film builds on what T\u2019Challa was worried about\nin the first film; the worries of neo-colonialism as\nother countries try to source vibranium, a tale as old as\ntime itself. This shows that the actions in the first film\ndo have consequences, and it causes the audience to\ndebate with themselves as to whether T\u2019Challa should\nhave kept the power of vibranium and Wakanda a\nsecret, especially with the events that follow in the\nfilm. The dramatic and phenomenal score by Ludwig\nG\u00f6ransson, as well as music from other artists, and\nushers the audience back into the world of Wakanda.\nAs a result of the member states\u2019 attempts to\nobtain vibranium, we are introduced to Namor\n(Tenoch Huerta), the leader of Talokan (Tl\u0101l\u014dc\u0101n),\nan underwater Aztec civilization overseen by the\nRain God, Tl\u0101loc. Namor, also known as the Feather\nSerpent God, sees this as a threat to his civilization and\nwants Wakanda to act, or they will face annihilation\nby his hands. Tenoch Huerta\u2019s portrayal of Namor\nis remarkable; he is charming, yet sinister, with his\ndrawn-out and soft-spoken threats.\nCaleb Eferakorho FilmSoc Writer\nA True Love Letter to Both Chadwick Boseman and the Character of T\u2019Challa\nNew Film Release\nBLACK PANTHER: WAKANDA\nFOREVER IS A POWERFUL,\nBREATH-TAKING TRIBUTE.\nTHE STORYLINE, MUSIC, AND\nACTING ARE EXCEPTIONAL, WITH\nANGELA BASSETT DELIVERING AN\nINCREDIBLE PERFORMANCE.

Seaweed\ncan also play a role\nin mitigating the effects of climate\nchange, as it actively sequesters CO2\n,\nwhich leads to the deacidification of\nour oceans. Oceans act as a carbon\nsink, actively taking in nearly 130\nbillion tons of CO2\neach year. Through\nphotosynthesis, seaweed converts CO2\ndissolved in our oceans, coupled with\nsunlight; and returns organic matter and\noxygen. This cycle can absorb carbon at\nrates up to 50 times greater than land-based forestry. As it grows, nearly 50%\nof the seaweed breaks off, with most of\nit drifting out to sea. This material sinks,\nand most of the carbon stored in that\nbiomass is permanently sequestered in\nsediments on the bottom of the ocean.\nWhen CO2\nin the atmosphere dissolves\ndirectly into the seawater, the pH of the\nocean is lowered and is thus more acidic.\nThe micro-algae that absorb and soak\nup CO2\nduring the day thereby increase\nthe pH of seawater and thus reverse\nthe process of acidification locally.\nNotpla\u2019s seaweed farms not only posit\na commercial benefit, but also have an\nenvironmental purpose by improving\nwaterquality,supplyingfoodandhabitat\nfor marine life, and by acting as a natural\nbarrier against erosion.\nNotplahaveembeddedseaweedintoa\nwiderangeofproducts.Theirmostrecent\nproduct, Notpla Coating, has been\nimplemented into fully biodegradable\nseaweed pulp food containers. Notpla\nCoating has many of the same grease\nand water-resistant properties of typical\ncoatings in takeaway\nfood packaging,\nexcept it\u2019s made from\nseaweed \u2013 not plastic.\nTraditional plastic\ncoatings contain\np e r f l u o r o a l o x y\nalkanes (PFAs),\nwhich are known\nto bioaccumulate in\nhumansandcontribute\nto a range of possible\ncancers. Notpla\u2019s\nalternative has been\ndesigned to biodegrade\nnaturally in just 29\ndays. The coating can\nbe recycled or thrown\ninto home compost,\nleaving no harmful\ntraces behind in the\nenvironment. This\nyear, Notpla has made\noveramilliontakeaway\nfood containers using\nNotpla Coating for\nthe delivery platform\nJust Eat, strengthening\ntheir pre-existing\nrelationship with the\nfirm. This relationship\nbegan with a pilot of seaweed-based\nsauce sachets made by Notpla and\ndistributed to a variety of Just Eat\nrestaurants. The pilot prevented more\nthan 46,000 plastic-ketchup sachets\nfrom entering landill.\nOther products from\nNotpla\u2019s range include\nNotpla Ooho, an edible\nbubble designed to\nreplace single-use plastic\npackaging for liquids\nand was used during the\n2019 London Marathon\nwhere over 36,000 edible\ncapsules were filled with\nLucozade and handed\nout to runners; Notpla\nPaper, which extracts\nthe fibres and biomass\nfrom the gelatinous part of seaweed and\nturns it into paper; and Notpla Pearls,\nwhich also aims to replace single-use\nplastic packaging for liquids within the\ncosmetics industry.\nFounderoftheEarthshotPrize,Prince\nWilliam,saidtoattendeesthatEarthshot\nwinners \u201cprove we can overcome our\nplanet\u2019s greatest challenge\u201d.\nTaylor Pomfret Science Editor\nEdited by: angie lo\ntaylor pomfret\nScience\nImperial start-up wins \u00a31 million Earthshot Prize\nDevelopment of a startup featuring seaweed-based plastic alternatives lands Imperial graduates\nPierre Paslier and Rodrigo Garcia the 2022 Earthshot Prize Credit: Wikimedia Commons\nCredit: Wikimedia Commons\nKelp, a type of lar\nChemical structure of Perfluro-1-isopropoxyhexane (PFA) \u2013 used in traditional\nplastic coatings for food containers.

    "content": "KEEP THE CAT FREE\n4 Felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nOpen Letter:\nTo the Imperial College\nChemical Engineering\nDepartment and Society,\nThis summer saw unprecedented heat waves and droughts in Europe, both made more probable by climate change. During this time,\n53,000 excess deaths were recorded. The recent devastating floods in Pakistan were also made more likely and severe by human induced\nclimate change by just the current levels of warming. The International Energy Agency (IEA) and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate\nChange (IPCC) are unanimous in calling for an end to investments in all fossil fuels if we wish to have a 50/50 chance of staying below 1.5\ndegrees, while a recent report by the UN Environment Program said there is \u201cno credible pathway to 1.5C\u201d.\nMeanwhile, major oil and gas companies are continuing with projects which would put us well past 1.5 degrees. This is unsurprising,\ngiven that these same companies have fought decades long campaigns against climate action1\ndespite knowing about the risks to civilisation.\nIt is in this context that the Imperial College Chemical Engineering Department and Society continue their relationship with oil and\ngas companies, in particular BP, Shell and Exxon. These companies are prominently featured in career\u2019s talks, such as the ones disrupted by\nImperial Climate Action at the beginning of this year. They also sponsor many activities, including the talent show, Frank Morton\u2019s and the\nBP book prize. The society itself received \u00a366,500 from Shell, BP and Exxon in the last 10 years2\n.\nThis cosy relationship serves to discourage radical but absolutely vital action to fight climate change. Even if many alumni do not go into\nthe oil and gas sector, we unjustifiably moderate our stance to rationalise being friends with those who do if we do not cut ties completely.\nWe force ourselves to believe the industry\u2019s false narrative that they are key players in the energy transition, despite companies in this sector\nhaving clearly acted in bad faith and continuing to do so. This relationship to the industry also means that many of us will stop short of\nsigning this open letter for fear of upsetting our professional and personal relationships.\nWhen members of Imperial Climate Action recently confronted staff and society responsible for this issue, it resulted in depressing but\nunfortunately very typical responses3:\n\u201cWe can\u2019t switch off oil overnight.\u201d\n\u201cThe government / university should take action, not us.\u201d\n\u201cThe society / department / university would suffer greatly without funding from oil and gas.\u201d\n\u201cDo you want society to go back 200 years?\u201d\nand the classic: \u201cYou know your clothes are made of oil?\u201d\nIt is amazing to behold this denial of responsibility and dearth of imagination from staff and students at a university which prizes initiative and innovation.\nGiven this, we at Imperial Climate Action and the undersigned request the following changes at the Chemical Engineering Department and Society:\n\u2022 An end to all sponsorship of, and participation in, activities by oil and gas companies.\n\u2022 An end to advertising of scholarships from oil and gas companies.\n\u2022 Introduce a department-wide policy of only welcoming companies which are in line with the Paris Agreement.\n\u2022 A greater focus on ethics within the curriculum that goes beyond the Business Ethics for Engineers course in the second year.\n\u2022 A greater focus on the climate and ecological crises within the curriculum that encompasses their social and political as well as their\ntechnical dimensions.\nWe propose to hold a meeting between Imperial Climate Action, signees of this letter and staff members to discuss these proposals online\nand open to anyone who may be interested.\nTo that end, this letter will be sent to relevant staff members if it obtains 50 signatures from students, staff or alumni affiliated to the\ndepartment. We believe these are the people who can best apply pressure and enact change within the department and society.\nImperial regularly teaches us to strive for excellence, develop critical thinking and benefit society through its research and education.\nMeanwhile, the Chemical Engineering Department and Society\u2019s relationship with oil and gas companies confines excellence to \u201cbeing\ngood at maths\u201d, stifles thought critical of the fossil fuel industry and serves to delay the climate action urgently required for civilisation to\nsurvive this century. We can do better.\nThis open letter was written by Chemical Engineering alumni Sebastian Gonzato (graduated 2018) in the name of Imperial Climate\nAction, and has been signed by .\n1\nSee for example #ExxonKnew, oil and gas advertisements over the years and the recent US Committee on Oversight and Reform hearings.\n2 This calculation was done by members of Imperial Climate Action based off of figures from Student Union accounts. This level of sponsorship at Imperial from oil and gas companies is unsurprisingly not limited to the Chemical Engineering Society.\n3 Some of these responses are, ironically enough, the focus of an article coming from Imperial\u2019s Centre for Environmental Policy.\nSign the open letter here\n\n"

A closely\nfought tournament held in the Sir Alexander Fleming Building last Saturday\nsaw Birmingham and Imperial A coming out on top with six wins and three\nlosses each after nine matches. This\nmeant a final match had to be played, in\nwhich Imperial A beat Birmingham by\n295 points to 255.\nThe winning team consisted of undergraduates Mattia Elkouby (second-year\nChemistry), Christine Hagerty (first-year Physics), Aden Ho (second-year\nmedicine) and Gregor Wilson (third-year Aeronautics). None of the players\non Imperial\u2019s A or B teams had competed in a quiz tournament prior to the\nstart of this term.\nAt first, King\u2019s College London and\nBirmingham seemed to be the frontrunners in the tournament. They were beatingmostotherteams\u2013King\u2019sbeatImperial A on a tiebreaker - and scored some\nimpressive early buzzes. However, right\nas it seemed as though King\u2019s might win\noutright without the need for a final,\ntheir fortunes changed. Over-eagerness\non the buzzer led to a few too many incorrect interruptions, providing Imperial B with their first\nvictory of the day in\na surprise twist. With\nthe wins and losses now tied between\nfive teams, Imperial\nA and Birmingham\nwent through based on\npoints scored.\nThe final saw Birmingham start off\nstrong - it seemed as\nthough they might\nreverse their defeat\nagainst Imperial earlier\nthat day. Imperial soon\ngot going and led on\npoints, thanks to high\nscores on the bonus\nquestions, but a string\nof correct starter questions from Birmingham nearly brought\nthe scores level. Unfortunately for Birmingham, two incorrect\nbuzzes late in the game\nprevented them from being able to catch\nup to Imperial, despite an early buzz on\nthe last question.\nThe British Novice tournament has\nbeen held every year since 2018 and is\naimed at students\nfrom universities across the country\nwho are new to competitive academic quizzing. This was the first time the\ntournament had\nbeen held in-person\nsince 2019. The format may be familiar\nto viewers of University Challenge:\nstudents represent\ntheir university in\nteams of four, but\nthe starter questions\nare much longer,\nyou can get bonus\npoints for a correct\nearly buzz, and the\nbonus questions are\nworth ten points\neach instead of five.\nFurthermore, Oxford and Cambridge\nare not split by college, and there may be\nmultiple teams from each university.\nThis year\u2019s British Novice tournament\nwas beset by train strikes and awkward\nterm dates, meaning that two tournaments had to be held on different dates.\nThe first was a smaller online tournament on 26th November, featuring four\nOxford teams, two Birmingham teams\nand one each from\nCambridge and York.\nYork fielded a player\nwho had had much\nexperience with highschool quizzing in the\nUS and secured their\nfirst ever tournament\nwin. Not to detract\nfrom the performances\nof Oxford, Cambridge\nand Birmingham, who\nfielded some impressively knowledgeable\nnovices; we\u2019ll surely be\nseeing more of them\nin next year\u2019s tourna-ments.\nImperial\u2019s strong performance despite\nan all-new novice roster is a reassurance\nfor those more experienced quizzers facing their final year, and I hope their success can serve as an inspiration for new\ngenerations of quiz players.\nKEEP THE CAT FREE\n16 Sport.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nImperial defends title at British Novice quiz\ntournament\nOscar O\u2019Flanagan Quiz Society Treasurer\nClubs&Societies\n\u201c\nNONE OF\nIMPERIAL\u2019S A OR\nB TEAM PLAYERS\nHAD COMPETED\nIN A QUIZ\nTOURNAMENT\nPRIOR TO THIS\nTERM.\nFingers on buzzers: Imperial A (left, L-R: Gregor, Aden, Christine, Mattia) and Birmingham (right) prepare to hear the\nfirst starter question of the final match, held in Huxley 308\nUniversity Challenge teammates Michael and Fatima read bonuses to Roehampton (left) while\nImperial B (right) wait for the next starter question\nCredit: ICU Quiz Society\nCredit: ICU Quiz Society\n\n"

Who knows, maybe one of these\nwill make it into your top Christmas film list.\nViolent Night\nEveryone loves a good action film at Christmas; the\n\u201cDie Hard for Christmas\u201d debate didn\u2019t appear out\nof nowhere. And even better than an action film is a\nChristmas action film. Santa knows whether you\u2019ve\nbeen naughty or nice, and \u201cViolent Night\u201d explores\nhow Santa goes about punishing the latter . Apparently, he will deliver lumps of coal to the bad guys \u201c...\nand shove it up their a**\u201d - you don\u2019t want to miss\nit.

Guess what could happen after she\u2019s\nrescued by a hot local dad (who\u2019s single by the way).\nNetflix never disappoints with a cringeworthy Christmas film and this one will make you laugh at its absurd-ity. Don\u2019t expect high production quality but, to be\nhonest, Lindsay Lohan\u2019s comeback should be a good\nenough reason to watch \u201cFalling for Christmas\u201d. Invite\nfriends over to watch it on Netflix from November 10.\nA Christmas Story Christmas\nIn a year of remakes, sequels and other (often\nunnecessary) takes on our favourite stories, Christmas movies were never going to remain untouched. In\nthis case, that\u2019s no bad thing. If any of you are aware\nof Christmas iconic 1983 film\u201dA Christmas Story\u201d, continue reading - others go watch it first. Its sequel back\nin 2012 wasn\u2019t successful, so fans of the original were\nsurprised when it was announced another one coming\nthis year. \u201dA Christmas Story Christmas\u201d follows Ralphie Parker, the al-grown-up child from the original\nmovie, as he tries to make the perfect Christmas for his\nfamily.Hereconnectswithchildhoodfriendsanddeals\nwith the passing of his Dad. The film starts slow, but\nstick with it and you will be won over. Even for those\nunfamiliar with the original story, this film is a great\ntitle to watch with family, bring nostalgia to your older\nrelatives and awaken Christmas spirit for everyone.\nThe Guardians of the Galaxy\nHoliday Special\nWho doesn\u2019t look forward to the Christmas specials,\nwhere a holidays spin is put onto our favourite TV\nshows? James Gunn is taking a similar approach with\nhis \u201cThe Guardians of the Galaxy Holiday Special\u201d .\nTake the usual Guardians of the Galaxy team and put\nthem into a Christmas story, where they will do anything to help their leader experience Christmas again.\nAt 44 minures long, the special makes for a fun, cosy\nand lightweight watch. Even more, I\u2019m sure not just\nMarvel fans will appreciate when Kevin Bacon, the\nlegend himself, makes an appearance. Released on Disney+ November 25.\nChristmas Collection 2022\nfilm.felix@imperial.ac.uk felixonline.co.uk\n12\nFilm Recommendations\nMike Buzadji Film Writer\nKEEP THE CAT FREE\nFilm\n\n"
