On that Saturday we\nhad about 800 fresher s moving\ninto Halls on Princes Gardens, i.e. about 600 cars driving into a20 odd space car park. This is a yearly nightmare as it is, but 'they'\n(not too sure who to blame)\ndecided that it would be a good\nweekend to block Exhibition Road\nwith a crane to bring in bulky\nmaterial to the new management\nschool building site, on top of\nthat, there was a peace protest\nmarch heading to Hyde park,\nwhich no staff had bothered\nchecking on to ask help from the\ntraffic police...\nLuckily, in the end, everything\nworked itself out as 'they' opened\na path on the side of princes gardens to let cars in. The traffic &\nsecurity staff were very helpful,\nwarden in g&re app teams were\nvery efficient in helping students\nmoving in efficiently, and it all\nactually worked out much better\norganised than any previous year.\nI wonder why 'they' never thought\nof opening that path on princes\ngardens before in all the years that\nwe blocked Exhibition Road our-selves!\nA Strange Portent\nWe received this at the beginning\nof term, but haven't had a letters\npage yet, as we had no others\nuntil this week - Ed\nSir,\nAs an ex-pat alum, I 've just\nnoticed that they're trying to\nchange our name to \"Imperial\nCollege London\". What next?\n\"Harvard University Cambridge\";\n\"Stanford University Palo Alto\"...\nThat's not going to happen and\nwe don't need \"London\" in our\nname either.\nNor, by the way, does anybody\ngive a damn that IC is part of\nLondon University. If people want\nto brandish around \"London\nUniversity\", then let them go to\nGoldsmiths or Birkbeck.\nThey're trying to cure a sick elephant by calling it a mouse.\nThey'll just end up with a sick\nmouse. Changing the name does-n't change the problem. Similarly,\nchanging IC's name is not going to\ngive it the kudos, celebrity, and\n\"instant-re co gnis ability\" it seeks.\nThis name changing mania\napparently arises from a survey\nsent out to IC grads, from which\nsome cuckoo deduced that the\nworld would be instantly enlightened if \"they\" screwed with IC's name. Either IC has been graduating a whole bunch of elephant\ndoctors or the cuckoo got it wrong.\nIn the cuckoo's defence, asking\nthe wrong questions can get you\nto the wrong answer. It's like asking Clinton if he cheated on his\nwife.\nImperial College London1\n. They\ncan't be serious.

If these changes\nare not stopped here at Imperial,\nquickly they will become wide-spread.\nI encourage you not to hesitate\nin using your positions as the students to speak up against fee\nincreases and the lack of respect\nfor the student body.

    "content": "NEWS FELIX Analysis: The Top-Up\nFees Proposal\nLast Wednesday there was an\nEmergency General Meeting of\nthe Imperial College Union\nCouncil to discuss the paper that\nthe Rector had produced advocating top-up fees for Imperial\nStudents.\nAt the meeting, the paper that\nwas to be brought to the College\nCouncil was effectively leaked as\ncopies were distributed to the large\ncrowd of students attending Union\nCouncil, despite being marked\n\"Confidential\". While first reports,\neven from your trusty copy of Felix,\nCouncil's permission is just part of the authorisation required for fees\nLoss Per Student\nThe motivation for the paper\nseems to be the disparity between\nthe cost of educating each student,\nwhich College claims is \u00a310,500,\nand the amount received from\n\u2022 .. have sf aoM that it costs!\nYou're costing College \u00a32,800 per year\nindicated that top-up fees of\n\u00a310,500 per year were to be intro-duce d, the paper is actually much\nless specific.\nStudent Protest\nThe Emergency Council meeting\neventually evolved into an\nEmergency General Meeting,\nwhere all the students of Imperial\nCollege are entitled to debate and\nvote on the issue on the table - in\nthis case, how the Union should\nrespond to the top-up fees prop os als. There was an unusually high\nturn-out and there was an enthusiastic discussion, mandating the\nteaches. Similar ns ott swot Al< Wbto\n\u00b0\nHEFCE (Higher Education Funding\nCouncil for England) and current\ntuition fees paid by students,\nwhich total around \u00a37,500\naccording to the Rector's proposal.\nFew can argue that this loss,\nwhich in fact totals around\n\u00a328million each year, has to be\nmet from somewhere but some do\nargue that a university should\nspend more on its students than\nwhat they're explicitly given for\nteaching. Indeed, in the end-of-year accounts published by\nImperial in July 2001, there was a real operating loss of \u00a31 million.\nCollege only remained in the black\ndw to be pub nd w li following\nthe next General Election at It are such that it seems that the O ove ff l menT would probably on lv wish tod \u201e *\n\u2022here \u201e pub h cs\nup port from an\number of higher e due art on J^ T\"**ms l\"od at Governmental support is key to College's plan\nPresident to strongly condemn top-up fees regardless of any concessions. The meeting eventually\npassed the motion that the students should organise a protest\noutside the 170 Queen's Gate,\nwhere the Rector's proposal would\nbe made. As Felix went to press,\nthis protest was scheduled to\noccur outside the residence during\nFriday morning.\nby selling off over \u00a316million of\nassets, which is far from a sus-taint able source of income.\nImperial Will Not Act Alone\nOne of the key points restricting\nthe immediate introduction of top-up fees is the caveat attached to\nthe end of the proposal, specifying\nthat Imperial College could only\nafford to charge top-up fees if other\nColleges \"of similar standing\" were\nto follow suit. It's certainly true,\nhowever, that Imperial seems to\nwant to take a lead in modifying\nthe way in which higher education\nis funded. This will doubtless go\ndown well with the Government,\nwhich backs a \"free market\" for\nuniversities including, presumably,\nthe ability for institutions to set\ntheir own prices as well as competition for research grants and\nexploitation of intellectual property.\nGovernment Support\nGiven recent noises from the\nGovernment, including an appearance by Minister for Higher\nEducation Margaret Hodge on the\nBBC's Newsnight programme on\nFELIX Issue1244 Editor\nDeputy Editor\nScience\nMusic\nNightlife\nFilm\nWeb\nCoffee Break\nSports\nWill Dugdale\nAlisdair Wren\nRosie Chandler\nSajini Wijetilleka\nPatrick Hoar\nSimon North\nJenny Lewis\nMike 'n' Jim\nAlex Coby\nFelix, Beit Quadrangle, Prince\nConsort Road, London\nSW7 2BB Tel: 020 7594 8072\nE mail: felix@ic.ac.uk\nFelix is a registered\nnewspaper:\nISSN 1040-0711\nCopyright \u00a9 Felix 2002\nPrinted by Witherbys, EC1\ni. \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 J scheme the Government has in\nmind, but it's certainly possible to\nimagine how the grants may be\nreallocated to universities with, for\nexample, a lower number of students from independent schools.\nNo amount\nWednesday, it seems likely that\napproval will be forthcoming which\nallows universities to charge top-up fees as they see fit. Officially,\nhowever, no statement has been\nmade but there is little doubt that\nthe Rector is sure of his ground,\ngiven the College management's contacts with policy-makers.\nAdditionally, for the numbers\npresented by the Rector's paper to\nadd up, current funding from\nHEFCE for each student must continue unchanged even after top-up\nfees are introduced. This money,\nclaims the paper, will be used to\nprovide poorer students with bur-s aries to cover the extra cost of\ntheir degree. Again, we have to\nhope that the Rector has information indicating that this will be possible under any new finance\nInformed Argument\nHowever this proposal is interpret-ed, the Emergency Council meeting stressed how the importance of\nan intelligent and informed argument from the student body opposing top-up fees was vital if either\nthe College or Government are to\ntake notice. Even protest could let\nCollege know that the students are\nwatching. Part of this must be the\nrealisation that this particular proposal paves the way for, but stops\nfar short of, committing the College\nto charge top-up fees or to set any\nlevel. Instead, the reasons for the\nrelease of this paper now, preempting any Governmental\nannouncement and possibly giving\ncarte blanche to the Rector on\nfees, are prime targets for examination by the student body.

My name is Simon and I will be\nyour editorial guide (until Will comes to his\nsenses) to all that is great and good in the\nworld of film. And yes, this is the reason why\nI'm not defending my GFQQ crown - apparently having access to the writers of the quiz is a \"conflict of interest\" or something official\nsounding like that, so I am forced to retire...\nunbeaten....\nAnyway, hope you find these pages to your li k ing. If you lot out there in the real world have\nany suggestions as to what you want, then feel\nfree to get in touch (felix.film@ic.ac.uk) and I 'll\nsee what I can do. Later...\n1/1/ 1\n/\nThis ore is going to be short on the Review\nand long on the social commentary. Yes, I am lazy. Yes, it is getting on for three in the\nmorning. But don't fool yourself into thinking these are the reasons I'm being skimpy\non the copy. I just don't want to give anything away\nI saw this movie in the company of one\nexceptionally jumpy girlfriend in one very\ngothic-esque, empty, echo-y cinema - without knowing anything about the film at all.\nAnd this is how I would love you lot to see\nit too. Its one of those movies that is\nde fanged by overly detailed reviews (Heat -for shame!). Big Brother meets Blair Witch\nhead on, with steadier cameras. That sums\nit up rather nicely I think.\nFive relatively unknown actors 'star' in a low-budget suspense/horror movie of the\njumpy persuasion. Their remit is to slum it\nfor a few weeks in the quest for a million\ndollars. So long as none of the five lose\ntheir bottle early everyone gets a share,\nwhile the whole thing is broadcast live on\nthe internet.\nBilled by the distributors as a film to rival\nPsycho and Halloween, expectations among\nhorror veterans were huge prior to its\nOctober release in the UK. To my mind they\nweren't far wrong. I'm not a huge horror\nfan, mainly because I scare too easily, but\nI 've watched (and been scared by) my fair\nshare. My Little Eye managed to give me\nThe Fear in a way I have never encountered\nbefore, so it's fair to say I was impressed.\nThe effects (for once aural rather than vis u al) are spot on, with some fine musical\nselections - most notably the hugely claustrophobic track \"Fuck the Pain Away\" by\nThe Peaches.\nI have to be honest and admit that I did a little bit of cheating before writing this\nreview. Partly due to lack of faith in my own\njudgement and partly due to curiosity as to\nhow sane people view this movie.\nWhat did I find? Polar opinions are what.\nNow, anyone who's read far too many\nreviews (me, for example) knows this is a good thing. You will either love or hate this\nmovie, it's that simple. 50-50 chance to\nthose of you with a betting streak. If you\nfancy a jumpy horror/thriller of the\nHitchcock persuasion (bearing in mind the\nguy is dead and no-one directs a thriller like\nAlfie) then go see now. You've got a fairly\ngood chance of not being disappointed....\nMy Little Eye was released on 4th October, Cert 18\nDonnie Darko\nFreakish high-school kid has run in with\nthe cold, dark rabbit of his soul. No, I am\nnot on any prescribed medication - this is\nprobably the best description of this movie\nthat you will read. Best movie of the year?\nYou'll certainly be finding people debating\nthat once it hits the multiplexes, because it\nis that good. I bet not one of them can\nexplain the damn thing though - I 've been\ntrying to for about three months (it was out\nin the States in 2001) and the best I can\ncome up is the fifteen word line at the top\nof this review.\nFor first-time writer/director Richard Kelly\nthis is an astonishing debut, bearing more\nthan a little resemblance to Lynchs best\nwork. Intriguing and confusing in equal\nmeasure with a sharp black humour running\nthickly through the plot, Donnie will really\ndraw you in. The solid soundtrack, filled\nwith eighties staples like Joy Division and\nDuran Duran, is topped off by a wondrous\ncover of the Tears for Fears track \"Mad\nWorld\". This one will be lined up alongside\nREM and Radiohead on moody teenage\ncompilation CD's by Christmas.\nDon't try to understand, don't try to work\nit all out - you'll only succeed in blowing a fuse. Lie back and enjoy the strangest\nmovie you will see this year. I guarantee\nthat this is the best film ever made starring\na man sized rabbit called Frank.\nDonnie Darko is released on 25th October 2002, Cert. 15.\nOceans 11\nAhhh what a lovely watch this is! A film to\nsuit all parties, if ever there was one. For\nthe boys we have cool gadgets and Mission\nImpossible style stunt work, with the excellent pairing of Clooney and Pitt in the lead\nroles. For the girls we have... well, Clooney\nand Pitt in the lead roles (nb - I checked\nwith a few ladies before writing this and\nthey happily confirmed that yes, they have\nseen/will see/are watching this movie mainly because of the dynamic duo).\nA remake of the \"classic\" Rat Pack film of\nthe 60's, this is one of those rarest of rarities - a cover version that outshines the\noriginal. By a long way. The plot centres\naround a typically audacious attempt to rob\nsome casinos in Las Vegas, a cool premise\nfor the cool cast, cool clothes, cool music\nand cool dialogue.

He argues that the\ntechnology is available but prohibitive costs\nmean that it might not happen for hundreds of\nyears.\nRobots and probes are capable of doing all\nthe work carried out by astronauts on the moon\nbut Dr Scott thinks that man will want to see\nfor himself.\nOn the pathfinder mission, images were\ntaken using rover robots\nPill camera\nA camera the size of a pill has been tested by\na patient at the Royal Hallamshire hospital in\nSheffield, giving detailed pictures of her digestive system. The camera measures 26 mm by\n11 mm and passes colour images to a belt unit\nworn for the eight hours it takes to travel\nthrough the body. The images can be watched\nby doctors to diagnose problems in the small\nintestine, which would normally require the\nuse of an endoscope or barium meal.\nNew camera the size of a pill could revolution is e medical diagnosis\nBid to clone humans?\nThe scientists who cloned Dolly the sheep at\nthe Roslin Institute in Edinburgh plan to put in\nan application to clone human embryos within\nsix months. Professor Ian Wilmut would like to\nproduce stem cells using the same technique\nthat produced Dolly. He would grow stem cells\nthat could be used in the treatment of heart\ndisease or Parkinson's disease, for example.\nThe application would have to be approved by\nfour ethics committees.\nDolly the Sheep was the first successfully\ncloned animal\nDr Scott advised that a manned trip should\ninclude poets and writers, versed in skills such\nas communication and metaphor who could\nconvey the \"beauty of space\" to humanity better than scientists. He also thinks that space\ntourists should have a place in helping to\nadvance space exploration. As his colleague\nProfessor Pillinger says, space tourism was \"no\nbad thing\".\n\"It's going to make space exploration go\nmuch faster\".\nDr Mark McAlindon said: \"This is a major\nadvance. It provides a far better picture of the\nsmall intestine. ... Now we can see all five plus\nmetres of it\".\nThe patient, 26 year old Joanne Rossall,\nsaid: \"I was quite worried that it wouldn't go\ndown. I generally get stomach pains but this\nwas no worse than normal\". While the camera\nwas inside her, Joanne carried on her life as\nnormal, by having lunch and going for a long\nwalk.\nThe Scottish Catholic church is strongly\nagainst any research involving human\nembryos. A spokesman said: \"An embryo is a human life with potential. To use that as a means to someone else's end - however well\nintended - is wrong\".\nProfessor Wilmut said in January that Dolly\nhas arthritis, possibly because of genetic\ndefects introduced in the cloning process.

Led from the sidelines by captain Roland Hettige,\n(who devastating ly is out after a heroic performance during this\nsummer's football match on tour\nagainst Sporting Lisbon).\nICSM started the match well,\nattacking and keeping the ball\ndeep in the opposition's half.\nNotable performances from the\nmaverick strikers, Marco and\nJohnny Hailes made the opposition defence almost cry with\nembarrassment, and new signing\nRob displayed some Brazilian\nstyle flicks to worry the Birkbeck\nkeeper from the starting whistle.\nICSM was rewarded after only 7\nminutes after when the new fresher signing 'Texan Mike' who dominated the midfield with his firm\nchallenges and typical Texan\nbravado that we've come to expect\nfrom him, struck a shot from outside the box, and left the keeper\nstanding as the ball shot right past\nhim into the top corner and ICSM\nwent ahead.\nHowever, while rejoicing in the\nfirst goal of the season, we forgot\nthat the match had re-started, and\nconstant pressure on the usually\nfortress-like defence of Tom Brick,\nChris Alesakis and the other star\nfresher Seb Ellis, caught ICSM\nunaware and Birkbeck calmly slotted in an equalise r. However, the\n2nd team spirit was un-fazed, and\nwe came straight back, and for\nlong periods were in control of the\nmidfield with the only trouble\ncoming from the opposition no. 7.\nDue to his Goliath-like proportions, he managed to provide our\ndefenders with a fair amount of\ntrouble, but Brick organised the\ndefence well and our keeper\nFleming pulled out the save of his\ncareer. We scored 2 more goals\nmaking the score 3-1, but then\nBirkbeck, with the aid of their no.\n7, and a few comedy errors on our\npart, managed to scrape the score\nback to 3-3.\nICSM started the 2nd half\nstrongly (after their inspiring team\ntalk), with another 1st year Jason\nbeing brought on for the injured\nSeb. Jason immediately proved\nhis worth playing a great ball to\nput the goal-scoring machine\nMarco Calandrini, who calmly\nslotted away his 2nd goal of the\nmatch. However, Birkbeck didn't want to be left behind and immediately scored again, making the\nscore 4-all. We began to detect a pattern emerging.Things began to\nget annoying as this time Birkbeck\nwent ahead when Fleming our\nkeeper, who decided to cover his\ngloves in fairy liquid to keep his\nhands soft and gentle, dropped\nthe ball to an awaiting Birkbeck\nattacker, who put them ahead.\nHowever, the ICSM spirit couldn't be beaten down and Tom Cusack\ndribbled through 5 of their play-ers, and after receiving the ball on\nthe edge of the area, linked up\nwith the pace-machine Johnny\nHailes, and fired a shot into the\ntop corner making the score 5-5.\nHowever, sheer bad-luck and a lack of fitness overcame us at the\nend, and despite all our best\nefforts, we couldn't stop their no.\n7 from scoring another goal.\nHowever credit has to be given to\nthe lads for putting on a great display and playing well in a very\nmemorable match. Judging by\nthis first performance, the 2nds have great potential this season.\nWye girls triumph\nGKT 110-3 Wye\nSunday mornings are never a good time to try and get eleven\ngirls to play football, especially\nin the freezing rain where the\npitch is a two-hour drive away.\nWe soon found this out when the\nminibus pulled in to find five\ncold girls waiting. Panicked\nphone calls started, as did lots of\nfrantic running round the village\ntrying to coax others from their\nwarm, comfy, beds.\nIn the last two seasons, Wye's record has not been the most\nimpressive, but this season we\nhave roped in one of the lads to\ncoach us who is even willing to\ncome to away matches. However\nthis might have been only for\nthis match - GKT have the great\nbonus of a huge bath for after\nthe match, and given the image\nof eleven gir lies in a steaming\nbath we didn't wonder why he\nwas so willing to come.\nWe kicked off in the drizzle\nafter a crash course in keeping\nfor one of our last-minute additions - the only reason she decided to be goalie was the advantage of trousers against the bitter\ncold.\nBoth teams played really well\nand I was particularly impressed\nwith the structure kept by the\nGKT team and how often they\ncalled to each other.\nWye kept up the pressure all\nthrough the first half, with several shots on goal, and Maria managed to get one in before half\ntime. Our coach kept us levelheaded and constantly reminded\nus that we couldn't get complacent even though we'd scored.\nInto the second half, great play\nfrom the Wye midfield sent a ball\nup to Geraldine in front of the\ngoal, and she managed to send\nus 2-0 up. This was followed by\nanother great shot from Laura\nthat was stopped by the GKT\nkeeper. Becks put our third goal\nhome, building on an earlier\neffort in a scramble in the first\nhalf involving almost kicking the\nkeeper in the head!\nThe defence did an excellent\njob of sending the ball forward\nthe few times it did stray into our\nhalf, and Rosie's shouting certainly scared off a few GKT who\ntried to tackle her !\nFull time and we were\namazed - our first match of the\nseason a win. Then off to the\nmuch-awaited bath (keeping the\ncoach firmly outside) and then\ndown to the bar for some very\nhealthy beans and chips.\nfelix@ic.ac.uk The student newspaper of Imperial College\n\n"

    "content": "COLUMN Editorial\nFELIX Hmm, well if you are reading this,\nit would be fair to assume that\nyou've read the news on the front\ncover. I have to admit that usually I don't write serious editorials, but\non a news item such as this, it\nwould be little more than churlish\nto ignore it, and spout my usual\ncrap (which would be much easier\nfor me, let me tell you).\nUsually in Felix, or at least certainly in the news sections, I try to\nensure that the amount of opinion\nis kept to a minimum, and that\neverything that goes in there is fact,\nhowever in this editorial section, I can write whatever I like, which, it\nshould be noticed, is not necessarily what I believe.\nSo before I start, I would like you\nall to hear my warning. I'm an\nargumentative old fool, and I very\nmuch enjoy playing the devil's advocate. Therefore, since it is fairly likely that all you here about both\nof our fairly major news items will\nbe negative, I'm going to try give\nyou some balance (although that\ndoesn't mean I'm just going to be\npositive). And what's more, I'm going to try and do it from a student point of view.\nOh, this should be fun. Letters of\ncomplaint to felix@ic.ac.uk incidentally. So first of all this whole UCL\nmerger business. I'm not really sure\nwhat's going on here. While, as I have said, we have just reported\nthis in the news, my personal opinion is that something very strange\nis going on here. If this hasn't been\nin discussion for years, not just a few months, then frankly I'm the\nmonkey's uncle. Two months just\nisn't long enough to get something\nof this magnitude sorted out.\nHowever, having said that, if it had\nbeen going on for longer on any\nserious scale, then the number of\npeople who would have to be\ninvolved to perform any sensible\nlevel of analysis would be great\nenough that one of them would\nhave let it slip to someone, and\ngossip being what it is...\nSo while the Rector is quite c un ning, he's not the sort of man who\nwould enter into this kind of deal\nwithout first getting some pretty\nhefty intel on the subject. So what\nconclusions can we draw from\nthis? Well, perhaps he and Sir\nDerek (chap in charge of UCL)\nhave enormous faith in the people\nthey are employing, to the extent\nthat they are entrusting the largest\nmerger in British educational history (and possibly the world) to their\ncare and two months of work.\nConvinced? Another option is that\nthe whole thing could perhaps be a smoke screen to draw attention\naway from the whole top up fees\nthing, but really that seems a little\nover the top, and there would probably be an easier way of doing it\nthat didn't involve another university (even though they can use the\naccountant, and while he pointed\nout some interesting points about\nsustainable sources of income (if\nwe hadn't sold an ice rink this year,\nImperial would be about 10 million\npounds in debt), he couldn't see\nanything that led us to believe that\nthe College is in real trouble, and\nsimilarly for UCL.\nSo that leaves us with two\noptions. And these are the most\nlikely two for me (although my economics isn't up to much, so one of\nthem may be completely far\nfetched). A merger of this variety is\nlikely to gain some interest, and if it\nwere to go through, it would certainly be conceivable that the\nAnother random picture of me, becuase while I have lots to say, I don't have much time to say it...\nsame smoke screen for the same\nissue on their home turf), so that\none doesn't really ring true.\nIt is certainly possible that the\ntwo colleges are in such dire financial need that a merger such as this\nis the only way that they can gather enough cash to extricate themselves from it. From the rumours\nthat one hears in this kind of job,\nthat wouldn't seem so unlikely,\napart from the fact that I have gone\nthrough their accounts (which are\non the ic.ac.uk website, if you want\nto see them yourself) with a trained\nresulting university would do quite\nwell in the international market.\nThus in this build up before we\nbecome this super university, with\nsome careful media manipulation,\nit might be possible to persuade\nvarious money-laden organisations\nto give both UCL and ourselves\nlarge lumps of cash. We then don't merge, the world stays a happy\nplace where we can hate non-sci-ent is ts in peace, but we can do it in\nthe comfort of a nice big research\nfunding armchair. That was a clumsy metaphor, incidentally.\nOr they actually believe it would\nbe good for the universities. But\nthat's boring.\n(While I'm trying to be good, I can't let it pass that Sir Derek is\nonly in charge of UCL for a couple\nof months while they find a new\nrector, so that might explain the\nhurry, but it seems unlikely even\nthen that he has any parti clu a rly misanthropic intentions.)\nSo now onto Top Up Fees. I'm not going to say too much on this\none, because I'm afraid, boys and\ngirls, that this is a foregone con clu sion. I truly believe that short of\nburning down College that there is\nnothing we can do to stop this one.\nSo you might as well live with it.\nAnd to make it slightly easier to live\nwith, let me explain something\nwhich no-one else probably will.\nWe get a lot of money from a group called HEFCE, who give universities money for fun. This money\nwill now be used to fund bursa ries for students who really can't afford\nto come here, and the idea is that\nthose who can afford to come here\nwill pay. Now this does seem to\nperpetuate a class difference, but\neven at the moment the statistics\nof financial background at Imperial\nare pretty worrying, considering the\ncurrent system is meant to give\neveryone from all backgrounds a chance to come here. So now those\nwho really can't afford it will be\nable to come (they'll be changing\nthe system for assessing whether\nyou should be 'assisted' or not,\nhopefully so it will be fair, as\nopposed to the current system),\nand those who can afford it will\nalso come. Which seems fair.\nI 've just done a quick calculation.\nWe get \u00a360 million-ish for taught\nstudents. At \u00a310 500 per degree,\nthat pays fully for 5700 of them.\nLeaving 2300 to pay the full price\n(less than 30%). Not that it will\nwork exactly like that, of course,\nbecuase it's a sliding scale, but you\nsee my point.\nAnd one final thing to remember:\nthis is not some scheme to screw\nyou around. Your degree may be\nfree to you, but it does cost money\nto someone: the rest of the British\npublic (most of whom didn't have\nthe chance to go to University).\nfelix@ic.ac.uk The student newspaper of Imperial College\n\n"

    "content": "MUSIC REVIEWS FELIX Albums & Singles\nNada Surf\nLet Go\n3/5\nHats off to Heavenly for another\nangelic performance. Nada Surf\nwill make you cry, make you\nlaugh, make you dance around\nyour room and all within the\nspace of an hour.\nAs a band that have travelled\nfrom nineties Britpop through\nmeaningless and bland guitar\nmusic and have arrived at the\nstage of electronica and emo-pop, Nada Surf know what we've\nall been through. They are us -Let Go displays signs of heart-break, loneliness, hope and\nmoreover, acceptance of how life\ncan be.\nOlder influences are evident in\nthe pounding beats of Hi-Speed\nSoul. Electronic strings support a powerful guitar presence with a subtlety that New Order would\ndo well to learn from. The undeniably catchy chorus and ever-building rhythmic bridges are\ntypical of this album.\nNada Surf are indie kids, pure\nand simple, and Happy Kid displays this beautifully. \"I'm just a happy kid stuck with the heart of\na sad blok e\" they explain in complete honesty. This is a bittersweet melody which could have\nyou weeping into your pillow or\ndancing the night away depending on what you want to listen to\n- desperately sincere lyrics or a fast and classic melody you can't get out of your head.\nThere are some tracks of pure\nbrilliance on this album while\nothers quietly slide into the\nbackground. Songs such as No\nQuick Fix and Killian's Red are\n\"nice\" and there's not a bad\nword to be said about them, but\nthey're not stand-out tracks and\nare perhaps a sign that however\ngood Nada Surf are - and they\nare good - they could be better.\nKeira\nMiss Black America\nGod Bless Miss Black America\n4/5\nThey've already teased and\ntaunted us with the soulful yet\nhard rocking singles Infinite\nChinese Box and Talk Hard but\nat last our appetites can finally\nbe satisfied. This is an album of\na band who know what we need,\nwhat music fans need now after\nthe ever-growing catalogue of\nNew York punk rock. This is the\nmusic that matters and the\nmusic that should be listened to.\nSo much popular music focuses on the hardships and downfalls of love, and though this may\nbe a significant concern for\ntoday's youth, the time has come\nfor the spotlight to fall on a more\nimperative issue - that being the\nwidespread indifferent approach\nto our place in the world today.\nMBA are trying to lead are vol u tion, and they look determined to\ndo it in true rock 'n' roll fashion.\nStepping in the political shoes of\nthe Manic Street Preachers and\nthe punk y routes of The Clash,\nhere are a bunch of guys who are\ntrying to save us from the soul-destroying apathy of today's youth and they're gonna have a damn good time while they're\ndoing it.\nTalk Hard is by far the best\ntrack on this album. The softer\nverses allow MBA to really bring\ntheir feelings through; it's almost\nheart-breaking to hear as they\ndesperately try to persuade us\nthat we can do anything we feel.\nContrasts of punk y guitar\nbridges, delicate melodies supporting sincere lyrics and unforgettable choruses really allow\nthe band to show their ever-expanding talent. They are a band of passion and self-belief\nand they know how to stir the\nsame furious determination in\neach one of us.\nThe closing track Montana\ndraws you in close with intricate\nguitar arrangements and then\nmakes you close your eyes and\nsmile as the tender vocals of\nSeymour Glass rise almost effortlessly towards a gentle yet truly\neffective climax. For a band that\nhave been compared to punk\nlegends the Sex Pistols, MBA\nsure know how to pull your\nheart-strings when they choose\nto and you'll find yourself wishing this beauty of a track would\nnever end.\nSome may consider this masterpiece to be emo-punk but\nplease let's not diminish its significance by labelling it in such a way. This album has far too\nmuch raw power, too many intelligently crafted lyrics and more\nimportantly, too much meaning\nto be hidden away in some NMEcrafted subcategory.\n\"And you say 'rock 'n' roll\ndestroys the soul?' I say, 'BITE\nME'\", they screech in the opening track. MBA are fed up with\nthe way they've been put down\nall their lives and this time\nthere's just no stopping them.\nAnd who'd want to? Keira\nSingles\nFischerspooner - The 15th Doing things with keyboards\nthat haven't been done properly\nin... well, ages, frankly,\nFischerspooner's new single\nhas been anticipated in electronica loving circles since\n'Emerge' was released at the\nbeginning of the summer. 'The\n15th' is a lot more laid-back\nand chilled-out than 'Emerge',\nbut is still absolutely breath tak ng, with cute little moog noises\nand synthesised drum beats\nand almost chilling vocals over\nthe top. If you like electronica,\nbuy this. If you don't like electronica, get a taste transplant,\nand then buy this.\n5/5 Jess\nJetplane Landing - Els Quatre\nGats EP\nAfter the incredible talent\nthat surfaced on their current\nalbum 'Zero For Conduct' and\nfrom the amazingly intense gigs\nat this year's Carling Festival,\nyou would expect only the best\nfrom Jetplane Landing. With\ncomparisons already being\nmade to At The Drive-ln and\nRATM, it could be said that\nthey are in the making to be our\nnext rock and roll saviours.lt\ncould be, but it shouldn't. The four tracks that make up\nEls Quatre Gats lack the melo d ic structure of previous Jetplane\nLanding material and seem to\ncontain the same political\nstanding of the latest Shakira\nrelease.\nRather than the usual individual and captivating style of\nJetplane Landing, this EP\nseems to mimic early Seafood\nmaterial with a bit more thrash\nthrown in to attract any metal\nhead wannabes.\nMy Fundamental Flow is the\nbetter taster of how the usually\nbrilliant Jetplane Landing can\nsound.

Each team then shoots\nten rounds, twice against each\nother club in the division, and\npoints are awarded for a win, loss\nor draw. A win would secure the\nteam 2 points, a draw 1 point and\nno points for a loss. The other\nclubs in the competition were all\nnon-university clubs. Teams consisted of five shooters, and for each\nround they had to shoot 1 ten-bull\ncard at 25 yards.\nIt was clear after the first few\nrounds that one team were the\nclear favourites. Team Nypro were\nshooting consistently high scores,\nand indeed they went on to win the\ndivision, but not as convincingly as\none might first have thought.\nIC started well, winning their\nfirst round match. The second did\nnot go quite as well, however, seeing us beaten by Blackpool A. Amazingly we managed a tie in the\nthird with City of Stoke , with both\nteams getting 477 out of 500\npoints. Some extremely good\nshooting on the part of our opponents, and some slightly below par\nshooting on our part, saw IC lose\nthe next two rounds. However, we\ndid not allow ourselves to be discouraged and put in some very\ngood scores for the next three; winning rounds six and seven, and\nonly losing out to City of Stoke at\nthe second attempt by 1 point in\nthe eighth.\nThe final two rounds did not go\nour way despite some good scores\nby our able shooters.

People, it would\nseem, are desperate to see what\ncould be one of the most exciting\nBritish bands in the last five\nyears, with tickets outside the\nvenue selling for about three\ntimes their original price. The\nLibertines have some high standards to live up to.\nBut before the band has a chance to reward the dedicated\ncrowd, Pearl emerge onstage\noffering sweet female vocals to\nsoothe any heated tempers. The\nmusic attempts to m esme rise the\ncrowd but the truth is that with\nthe buzz surrounding tonight's headliners, this really isn't the\ntime or place for such delicate\nmelody.\nIt's sad to admit but without\nthe presence of the lead-singer's husband - Supergrass' Danny\nGlover - on drums, it looks doubtful anyone would have looked up\nfrom their pints. A tragic and\nunfair oversight to make.\nFinally it's time for the long-awaited Libertines to make an\nappearance. Kitted out in vintage\njackets and home-made shirts,\nthe lads seem somewhat unnaturally calm despite the screaming\nexpectations of the crowd. They\npick up their instruments and get\nstraight down to business. And as\nsoon as they do, any fears of disappointment from the crowd are\nimmediately dissolved. As that\nfirst beat resonates through the\nfloor, there is no stopping the true\npunk spirit behind the fresh and\nfrantic melodies of these four\nyoung locals.\nUp The Bracket comes second\non the set list an unusual place\nfor a band's latest single, but\nthat's because the boys have no\nneed or wish to finish with a sure\nthing.\nAs it turns out, every track of\nthe set is an ingenious fusion of\nenergetic riffs and pure rock pas-sion, and this little wonder is no\nexception. Apart from the few at\nthe back gasping for water, the\nwhole crowd is moving - legs and\narms flying in every direction,\nabsolutely everyone is dancing.\nThe crowd tonight are up for a good time and The Libertines are\ndamn well going to give them\none.\nBy the time the opening of\nWhat A Waster fires up, there is\nno stopping possibly one of the\ngreatest nights the 100 Club has\never seen.\nThe recent nationwide tour has\nobviously had an extremely positive effect on the band and the set\nis tight, together and kicking\nrock-ass. A mutter of an introduction is the only thing we hear\nfrom frontman Peter Doherty but\nthe band provide enough of an\non-stage presence without the\nneed of witty repertoire - the\nmusic speaks for itself.\nThe Libertines don't show any\ndanger of disappointing throughout all of tonight's forty minute\nset. The pure rock attitude and\nunquestionable energy is absolute\nin every member of the band and\nit doesn't stop there. Onlookers\nare helplessly infected with the\nsame dynamic stance and suddenly feel an impulse to become\na greater part of the experience\ntonight.\nAs the last note of the chart hit\n/ Get Along fades away, the\ncrowd is divided into three groups\n- those who are rushing to snatch\na set list, those fighting to grab a Libertine and those left lying on\nthe floor wondering if it really was\nthe best gig of their lives.\nKeira\nSingles\n[(continued)\nsaid mate, running his greasy\nfingers through his sad-looking\n'Gallagher' barnet, \"Give me\nPaul Weller any day. He's so\ninnovative. On his last album\nhe had a record 17 different\nHammond organs.\"\nYour fucking stepmother lis\ntens to Coldplay, and this is a woman who thought Art\nGarfunkel was sexy. Put this on\nloud next time she comes\nround, throw your clothes on\nthe floor and leave a few lines\nof talc on the dresser: you won't regret it.\nJoe Parker\nQueen Adreena - FM Doll\nIt's the return of Katie-Jane\nand her temper tantrums.\nIntense to the max, screaming\nfrom the outset, she makes the\nwhole room vibrate with her\nsharp crescendo and skillfully\nmade background noise. It's typical ragged Queen Adreena\nfull frontal sonic assault, show'\ning the abandonment of their\nwispier dark faerie side, which\nis reminiscent of their new\nalbum. Two minutes later, it's more of the same with the\nsame vibrant energy, yet unbelievably enjoyable, and energizing despite my not being able to\nwork out what she's saying.\nDark, subversive and metallic\nfun.\n4/5 Sajini\nCOMPETITION TIME\nHow do you fancy winning a copy of the new Safri Duo\nalbum?

    "content": "COLUMN FELIX From The Union\nStudent Fees\nNo doubt you will have read the news that the\nRector has presented a paper to the College\ngoverning body asking permission to charge students fees to home and EU students that reflect\nthe true economic cost of education.\nThe introduction of fees that correspond to\nthe full economic cost of education represents a fundamental shift in the funding of higher edu-cation. The Union realises that the cost of providing an international standard of teaching and\nresearch must be met and that there is a funding shortfall in undergraduate teaching. A recent review showed it costs approximately\n\u00a310,500 to teach a Home/EU student.\nCurrently the College receives about \u00a37,700\nfrom HEFCE and student fees, this represents a short-fall of \u00a32,800.\nThe Union recognises that we cannot allow\nthis funding shortfall to continue. However, we\nare concerned that most Imperial students are\nalready expected to contribute some of these\ncosts, and any extra financial burden may further increase student hardship.\nThe College are suggesting charging full fees\nof \u00a310,500 with the caveat that the College\nretains its current teaching grant from HEFCE\n(approximately \u00a350M) to fund bursa ries for students that cannot afford to pay full fees. The\nCollege aims to implement a needs-blind s ys tem, one that aims to allow the top-calibre students to enter College regards of their financial\nbackground.\nAny system for assessing the bursa ries will be\nbased on a means testing scheme. Means testing assumes that parent's wealth equates\ndirectly to their generosity towards their children. This is not always the case, indeed a recent survey conducted by Barclays Bank\nshowed that 17% of students receive no contribution from their parents. A further 30%\nreceived less than the government's recommended contribution. There is a real danger\nthat a large proportion of high quality students\ncould not afford to attend Imperial.\nImperial College is a world-class higher education institution that must continue to attract\nthe best students regardless of their financial\nbackground. We continue to support widening\naccess for all students; and the Union has stated that it opposes any changes that compromise this principle. There is a very real danger\nthat the perception of large debt will stop students from entering higher education.\nTo gauge the student opinion, I called an\nemergency meeting of the Union Council on\nWednesday where these issues was discussed.\nThe meeting was one of the best attended in\nrecent years. The students gave a clear message that they are totally against the principle of\ncharging full fees and vehemently opposed the\npaper tabled by the Rector. The strength of feeling was such that the students have organised\na protest on Friday morning to show their opposition to the their scheme. One of the clear messages was that students felt offended that they\nwere not consulted on the issue of student fees.\nAs a major stake holder, students or their representatives must be involved at all stages when\nkey decisions are being made about the future\nof their university.\nAny proposed changes are unlikely to take\neffect till 2006 and indeed many students feel\nthat it does not effect them. It is important to\nrealise that if this system is introduced, you will\nhave to start planning to send your children to\nhigher education institutions that may charge\nfull fees.\nUCL Merger\nThe Union was surprised by the announcement\nthat Imperial College are in talks with University\nCollege London with a view to a possible mer g er. The College have stated that it will undergo\na consultation with the key stake holders with a view to making a decision by mid December.\nProponents of the merger argue that this will\ncreate a \"super-university\" with a combined\npopulation of 28,000 students and the critical\nmass to compete on the international scale. The\nproposed merger raises a whole of number of\nissues and it is important not to jump to con-clu s ions. The Union welcomes the chance for\nan extensive consultation process with the student body. Any merger proposal would need to\nshow that the university experience for Imperial\nCollege students will not be compromised and\nthe proposed merger will add value to the\norganisation. The Union will engage in a wide\nconsultation with the student body over the next\nfew weeks. We will conduct college wide\ndebates on the issues and will seek to produce\na response to the governing body in December.\nUCL is an institution which shares our pursuit\nof excellence in teaching and research, and the\nUnion is always in favour of enhancing the academic experience of our students. We must\nwork to ensure that the quality of our teaching\nand research is not compromised by any proposed merger.\nThe idea raises a number of important question for the Union. Will there be one Union?\nWhere will it be based? UCL Union are in the\nNUS and we are not and how that might affect\nthe students here. It is also recognised that the\ncultures at the two institutions are different and\nthat will present extra challenges for any proposed merger. There has already been concern\nexpressed about the relative sizes of both institutions. UCL has some 18,000 students and\nImperial has 10,000 and in a democratic s ys tem, UCL students may dominate in the arena\nof Union governance.\nIt also begs the question of what will happen\nto the University of London. There have been\nsome clear indications from the College that it\nwishes to leave the University of London and\nsetup as a stand-alone institution. Indeed it is\nexpected that the Privy Council will grant the\nCollege reserve degree awarding powers this\nautumn. If this combined institution was to\nleave, University of London will be struggling to\nsurvive.\nThese issues and more will be discussed\nopenly. We need an informed debate based\nfacts and figures, and focused on the real\nissues. We have met with UCL Union to start\ndiscussions and will be producing a joint statement of intent. The Unions will be setting up a joint group to co-ordinate our efforts and both\nUnions will produce a response to the proposed\nmerger plans. I will outline a more detailed\ntimetable at the meeting of Council on Monday\n21st October identifying key milestones in the\nprocess.\nThe proposed merger must not come too\nmuch as a surprise. This has been a trend within the UK. Recent high profile mergers have\nincluded UMIST and Manchester, and Guildhall\nand North London. There seems to be a clear\nstrategy to create large higher education institutions that can compete on the global scale. This\nwould radically change the tertiary education\nlandscape in the UK.\nA final word\nThese are undoubtedly the two biggest issues\nthe College has faced in recent years. It is\nimportant that the Union plays a key role in\nensuring that students' views are taken into\naccount when important decisions are made\nabout your future. It is equally crucial that the\nstudent body is active in letting its voice be\nheard. Over the coming weeks your representatives will be contacting you to gauge your views\nor you are welcome to contact me to express\nyour opinions. So please get involved and have\nyour say.\nfelix@ic.ac.uk The student newspaper of Imperial College\n\n"

The successful merger\nwhich formed GlaxoSmithKline was re-announced in January 2000.\nIf Imperial College and University College do\nmerge successfully, Sir Richard will ultimately\nbecome head of one of the largest institutions in\nthe world.\nSir Richard has certainly expressed an interest in influencing the country's research in the\npast - particularly in biomedical sciences -though whether this merger is part of some\ngrand plan is unclear. However, the merger will\nprovide an excellent stage to direct policy on\nhow universities are run, not just about their\nresearch, but the whole of the British higher\neducation system. AW\nFull details of the UCL merger can be found on\npage 3; a Union statement is on page 4.\nCollege Denies Top-up Fees\nDespite the planned presentation\nof a paper to College Council on\nFriday backing the payment of\ntop-up fees by Imperial students,\nthe College has told the BBC that\nit was \"absolutely not true\" that\nthe introduction of top-up fees\nwould be discussed.\nThis seems directly contrary to\nthe paper, which asks Council to\nagree that the College should publicly announce its wish to introduce top-up fees for its students\nshould the Government remove\nthe \u00a31,100 cap on tuition fees.\nThe paper does not specify the\nlevel of fees that Imperial would\nhope to introduce, but \u00a310,500\nwas used only as an example in a calculation representing the\nadvantages to top-up charging.\nRegardless, there certainly\nappears to be a disparity between\nthe papers published for Council\nand the impression College\nsources are giving to the national\nmedia. In an interview with the\nUnion media, Director of Strategy\nand Communication Chris Towler\nsaid \"it's very clear what the\ndeficits in university funding are\",\nstating that Imperial College lost\n\u00a32,800 per year on each student.\nPending a government white\npaper, the contents of which the\nCollege administration did not\n\"officially know\", he indicated that\ntop-up fees \"will be an acceptable\nway forward.\"\nFees are unlikely to be introduced before the next general\nelection, nor will any currently registered students be expected to\npay top-up fees. AW\nBe informed. See inside for the\nfull story of the top-up fee proposals and what they mean.\nSen (Union President) explains |\nwhat the hell is going on.\nI( Will, Felix Editor) also try and\nexplain what the hell is going\non.

    "content": "FELIX MUSIC REVIEWS13 Albums & Singles\nMcAlmont and Butler\nBring It Back\n3/5\nBernard Butler once of Suede has\nbeen described in some quarters\nas the best all-round guitarist\nsince Clapton. But he has also\nbeen painted as the most difficult\nman to work with due to the fact\nthat he has split with all his writing partners citing \"musical differ-en ces\". So after his hit and miss\nsolo career was put to rest he has\nreturned to work with other difficult artist David McAlmont who\nhe had a semi-successful partnership with back in 1995 with single Yes going top 10.\nSo have the years added more\nsubstance to their music or are\nthey destined to f litter out of the\nlimelight again? Well, on the\nstrength of the first track, the\nintriguingly titled \"Theme From\",\nyou hope they carry on forever as\nthis track that has anthem written all over it with is luscious big\nsound strings and funky beats,\nmixed with hard wired guitar riffs.\nThis is a song that shows the\nobvious potential that the duo\npossess with Butler's knowledge\nof merging rock and blues\ntogether with McAlmont's ability\nto write soulful tunes and unique\nvoice.\nUnfortunately the promise of\nthis opening rarely resurfaces\nlater in the album. Only current\nsingles Falling and Bring it Back\nshow any desire to stay with the\nnow and not revert back to a sort\nof Motown throwback tribute\nband. Most of the songs follow a similar pattern of either blues or\nfunk guitars and background\nstrings that often rise to the fore.\nThen with the song in full swing\nthe vocals go up higher and the\nguitar solos get longer to create a cacophony of inviting sounds.\nHowever the overall affect is to\nmake you think that they are trying too hard to make each song\ninto a single.\nThere are exceptions, Blue for\nexample is a song that could\neasily have been pulled from one\nof Butler's solo albums and the\nrather mismatched vocal range\npossibly supports this idea.\nOverall there is plenty to suggest\nfuture greatness, but it needs to\nall come together at the same\ntime and not in patches, but the\nalbum is worth a listen for those\npatches alone.

But its is difficult to see how\ngetting a bunch of has-been\nsingers (Buster Bloodvessel and\nHazel O 'Connor) and new up and\ncoming acts (David Fisher) plus\nsome never heard of before to do\nso is good music. Admittedly,\nsome of the tracks are quite good\nbut overall you get the feeling of\nunion bands trying to copy the\ngreat man.\nThe start is quite promising with\nIva Davies & Icehouse performing\na rather haunting version of Loving\nthe Alien. The track is an acoustic\nversion with the different layers\nbeautifully merging into each\nother to create a version possible\nbetter then the original (well at\nleast on par). EN do a passable\nApollo 440 style version of Life on\nMars but it just doesn't quite work\non the whole. Blondie are represented here with their live version\nof Heroes and this is pretty good,\nwhich is what you expect of a band of their quality. The only\nsour note is the persistent spacey\nlike noisy that runs throughout.\nTacye's cover of The Man Who\nSold The World is worth a mention only for the fact that they at\nleast have tried to do something\ncompletely different, but again\ntheir techno beats just don't work.\nThe album is also not helped by\nthe fact that two songs on here are\ncovered twice by different artists\nthe sole purpose of which seems\nto be that you can compare how\nbad they are. So overall this\nalbum is not worth the effort apart\nfor the first song.\nTank\nSingles\n{(continued)\ne rly used to underline the passionate emotions of the track.\nAs for the usual political\nangst that Jetplane Landing\nseemingly love to deliver - if!\nyou wanna piss off your parents\nby jumping around your room\nwith your stereo on far too loud\na volume then this is the track\nfor you - but if you're after\nsome decent and meaningful\nmusic, look elsewhere.\nI'm not saying this isn't good\nmusic, it's just not the best\nthey've done and surely if\nyou're gonna do a job at all, you\nmight as well do it well\n2/5 Keira\nThe Pattern: Nothing Of Value\nListen up!

I love a really good whodunit and\nthis is the genre at its best. James tosses your\nimagination around so that at the final confrontation with the murderer you have suspected and disregarded just about every character\nin the book.\nAdam Dalgliesh is the chief investigator; he\nand his team were brought in because of the\nhigh social standing of some of those involved.\nVenetia Aldridge, QC, is a brilliant, ambitious\nwoman with the ability to rub everyone she\nmeets up the wrong way. This includes her ex-husband, his new wife and child, her own\neighteen year old daughter, her boss, her col-leagues. In fact, the best thing that anyone can\nsay about her after her death is that she was a \"brilliant lawyer\". So Dalgliesh is not short of\nsuspects, since the murder took place in\nChambers it had to be committed by someone\nwith a key or someone whom she knew well\nenough to let in. There is also a strangely symbolic act of desecration to the murdered body\nof Ms Aldridge which adds another dimension\nto it as far as the investigating officers are con-cern ed. The police have the added problem of dealing with lawyers who are skilled at the art of\nnot telling the whole truth without actually\nlying. This results in obstructions and problems\nwhich slow their progress. These sometimes\npolitical, sometimes selfish acts have serious\nramifications in the end as another murder\ntakes place. This time, the prime suspect for\nthe murder of Venetia Aldridge is the victim,\nbut is it the same murderer? It has to be con-nec ted, but it is difficult to see how. As the connections become clearer and the murderer's identity emerges, there is a race to stop further\ndeaths.\nJames also questions our morals, when is a crime not a crime? Is our justice system right if\nsomeone who is known to be guilty can be let\noff by a jury? Innocent until proven guilty? Are\nsome crimes forgivable under certain c irc um stances?\nP.D. James has written an evocative,\nthought provoking mystery that I thoroughly\nenjoyed reading and hope you will too.\nPublished by Faber and Faber Ltd.\nISBN: 0-571-19541-5\n\u00a39.99\nOk, so this is not a highly intellectual book but\nif you like to escape into a different world without having to occupy any brain cells, then this\ndoes a pretty good job of creating a suitable\nworld for you.\nAnna Farrier begins the novel in a live-in relationship with a gorgeous heir called Seb\nLavenham. Unfortunately he is also a complete\nnightmare to be with and live with. Anna starts\nto have doubts despite being head over heels in\nlove with him. After receiving advice from her\nnew friend, Gina, she leaves an advertisement\nin the Kensington library to try and find a place\nas an author's assistant. She takes up a position as an assistant to the famous novelist,\nCassandra Knight, with the intention of\nadvancing her plans for being an author her-self. However, she in fact ends up as a general\ns civ vy pandering to Cassandra's every need,\nand nanny to her appa ling child, Zac. Zac who\nfinds it funny to put cereal in Anna's hair on the\nway to school. Zac, whose sole aim is to make\nhis nanny's life hell and is very good at it. Zac,\nwho has been through five different nannies in\ntwelve months.\nFor me the most wonderful thing about this\nbook is what the Literary Review describes as\nthe \"nanny mafia\". The idea is that nannies\nconspire to create a demand so that they have\nbetter working conditions than their employers,\nwith posh cars, holidays organised around their\ndemands plus fantastic accommodation. The\nsole purpose of the nannies, male and female,\nis to capture a rich, important partner and Gina\ntakes it upon herself to find Anna a suitable\nmatch. This match ends up being yet another\ngorgeous heir, this time to a Scottish castle,\nJamie. Anna begins to develop an attraction to\nhim before her break up with Seb and continues feeling it at a chance meeting while acting\nas nanny to Zac. It is Anna's tendency to get\ninvolved with men who are heirs to a fortune\nthat provides the title for this book.\nThis is a cheeky, cheerful book with a very\nhumourous take on the life of the upper class\nwannabes. It is an amusing tale, with stereotypical characters resulting in a fun, entertaining story of life's little problems and bigger\nmishaps.\nPublished by Headline\nISBN: 0-7472-6130-X \u00a35.99\nOh dear, will everyone please do me a favour -do not buy this book. It is not good. In fact, I will go further than that and say I really did not\nenjoy reading this. The sole reason I finished it\nwas because of you guys. I decided that if I was going to be this rude about a book then I really ought to have finished reading it. Less a novel about the deleterious effects of cocaine\non a society and more an advertisement for\nhow \"cool\" the author thinks he is. If you only\nread these reviews to find a good book, then\nstop now. If, however, you want to listen to me\nhaving a good moan or you're incredibly bored\nthen carry on. Either way, it makes no difference to me because I 've still got this printed\nand off my 34D chest.\nFrank Prentice admits to quintuple murders\nto the shock of the many people who know and\nlove him. Frank's brother Charles is informed\nand sets off to try and discover the truth since\nhe cannot believe that his brother could do\nsuch a thing either. All this takes place in a sexy Spanish resort for British people with far\ntoo much money and far too little sense. The\nsophisticated appearance of the resort at first\nimpresses and stuns Charles but soon he discovers that this is, in fact, a smoke-screen covering up a society with an insatiable and dangerous desire for fun and leisure. This novel\ncould be viewed as a sociological study when\nCharles takes charge of the creation of a new\nleisure plaza. He attempts to establish a community in a limited time scale and in the\nprocess of doing this he discovers the weaker,\nmore brutal side of human nature.\nWhat really confuses me is the number of\nbrilliant write-ups this book seems to have\nreceived from critics. I think that it could be\ndue to the fact that this book was short listed\nfor a Whitbread award. Once one 'literary\ngenius' has decided it is to be a modern classic the rest follow in a somewhat disappointing\nfashion. Reading is a personal and individual\nexperience, so I cannot guarantee that you will\ndislike this as much as I did. I can only give\nyou my opinion, which is what this column is\nfor. I think it was a waste of good trees and will\nbe a waste of your good money if you buy it. So\ndon't.

    "content": "FELIX NEWS03 The UCL Merger In Full\nLast week, Imperial College\nannounced that it had been in\ntalks with University College\nLondon about a possible merger.\nOf primary interest is why this\nmerger might be going ahead.\nThere's no shortage to opposition\nboth among the staff and student\npopulations of the two colleges.\nNew University of London\nWhile everyone was speculating\nthat the merger of Imperial and\nUniversity might signal the end of\naffiliation to the University of\nLondon, Imperial's Rector Sir\nRichard Sykes indicated that he\nwanted to form \"The University of\nLondon\", despite the current existence of The University of London.\nThis may indicate a plan for eventual absorption of all London's col-leg es, or even closure of those considered unworthy to join the new\nbody.\nFree Market\nWhen questioned on the BBC's Newsnight programme, Sir\nRichard expressed support for the\nGovernment's position that universities should operate in a freer\nmarket. He also \"wouldn't mind\"\nseeing smaller, less popular universities shutting down if they\nwere unable to secure the\nimproved funding that the new\ninstitution, for example, will be\nable to command with its\nincreased size.\nLondon School of Economics\nBack in 2000, Felix reported that\nthe College had plans for a merger\nwith LSE. While nothing apparently came from these talks, the\nCollege management did admit\nthat LSE had been approached\nabout merger. Additionally, they\nare also likely to charge top-up\nfees alongside other colleges.\nArts Departments To Close?\nMost of the immediate advantages\nfrom merger arise from the disposal of shared resources that are no\nlonger required, which in many\ncases means staff. A source in the\nUniversity of London suggested\nthat UCL's humanities departments might be \"phased out\" in\norder to focus on the scientific\nFinancial Pressure\nIt's no secret that both Imperial and\nUCL have been suffering financial\nproblems for the past years, nor is it\ndenied by the College that financial\nmotivations are behind the plan to\nmerge.\nImperial College lost around\n\u00a31.6million last year but sold\naround \u00a316million of assets to offset the loss and improve their financial reserved. However, since the\n2000 fiscal year, Imperial has tightened up its finances considerably,\nthough the published accounts only\ntell the story of Sir Richard Sykes'\nfirst six months as Rector of\nImperial.\nConversely, University College are\n\"shafted\" according to an accountant Felix asked to examine their\nannual reports, who added \"I wouldn't touch them with a barge-pole.\" While the accounts don't reveal much detail about UCL's activities, they lost \u00a32.8million on\n2000-2001's activity alone. They\nalso had to call in emergency overdraft measures and have \u00a375million in long-term debt.\nTheir financial management may\nbe partly to blame - the amount of\nmoney owed to them by other\norganisations rose from \u00a384m to\n\u00a3100m in just one year. At the\nsame time, money owed to other\norganisations by UCL increased\nfrom \u00a34million to \u00a310million and\nUCL's \"cash-in-hand\" all but van-is he d. Both IC and UCL lost significant amounts of money in stock\nmarket collapses - around 12% of\ntheir value, in fact - but Imperial\nsuffered most from the devaluation\nof Turbo Genset Inc. The value of\nthose shares is listed at \u00a328m, but\nis now worth little more than\n\u00a31.5m. If Imperial were relying on\nthe sale of those shares to fund any\nlarge projects, the money has now\ndisappeared.\nMoney is doubtless the main driving force behind the merger, but can\nSir Richard work his industrial\nmagic on UCL's ailing finances?4W departments which bring in the\nlargest research grants.\nMerger Rescue\nWhile UCL looks like it has the\nmost to gain from a merger, both\nImperial and UCL need some way\nto secure their long-term future\n(see Financial Pressure, below).\nThe top-up fees proposal that will\nbe presented to College Council on\nFriday may be one way of balancing the books, but there's clearly a problem at UCL, which is also likely to charge top-up fees when the\nGovernment approves the move\naccording to Chris Towler,\nDirectory of Strategy and\nCommunications.\n\"Critical mass\" is a phrase central to College's communications\non the merger - the combined\npower of both Imperial and UCL's attraction for research grants\nshould prove insurmountable.\nGovernment Support\nThe Government have clearly supported the plan for merger, and\nthat between the University of\nManchester and UMIST. Given\nthat the Government's recent policy on university funding have been\nless than popular with the Unions,\nthis may be a bad sign if the\nRector is seeking support from students for the plan. However, contacting the student body about the\nmerger seemed more of an afterthought than a priority, with both\nnational media and College staff\ninformed well in advance of any\nofficial notice from the management by e mail.\nStudent Input\nWith Imperial College Union focusing on the proposed top-up fees, it\nmay be some time before some\ncoordinated response on the merger plans comes from Beit Quad.\nCertainly students have much to\nlose from any potential merger,\nparticularly if it fails to lower the\nneed for extra tuition fees. The\nsheer practicality of getting two\nclasses into the same lecture theatre remains a concern for students and staff alike, though\nwhether staff influence will succeed where students may fail\nremains to be seen.

    "content": "FELIX QiGong\nQi gong-strengthens your mind to achieve\nhappiness\nTeachings from ancient China-qi gong, are\nnow taught at Imperial by Prof Zhao Lianting\nfrom China. With the aim of achieving fulfilment these exercises are rooted in traditional\nChinese, rather than western science. But do\nthey work, and how should a western scientist react to this very different theoretical\nframework?\nWant Happiness? Probably. But what do\nwe really mean by happiness? One could venture to say that this question lies at the heart\nof each human being's life and at\nthe functioning of a society. You\nmay agree that an attempt to define\nhappiness will end in something\nlike: happiness is a state where one\n'feels happy', and is thus subjectively determined.\nA scientist, however, might click\nat the word 'state' and say: \"states\nof happiness could perhaps be\nidentified by looking at people who\nfeel happy. It should be possible to\ndetermine some key variables that\nthey have in common and hence\narrive at a determinable and measurable definition of happiness,\nalbeit originally based on the test\npersons 'feeling happy'\".\nSo what do you think these key\nvariables would be? Some of you\nwill probably think of very tangible,\nconcise things, perhaps even the\nright house, car, good-looking\nspouse, whatever.\nSome, be it the Dalai Llama,\nMuslim/Christian priest or a Chinese qi gong master, would say\nthat this notion of happiness lies at\nthe heart of the problems in the\nwestern world, amongst others.\nAn alternative view on happiness\nis to identify other key variables,\nsuch as the degree of true love you\nhave towards yourself and others. Identifying\nsuch variables should properly be considered\none of the main tasks of science.\nA very specific approach towards achieving\nhappiness can be found in the ancient\nChinese teaching of qi gong. Prof. Zhao from\nthe Chinese National Institute for Qi Gong is\nnow teaching a course here at Imperial. He\nformulates the aims of the exercises as (i) health (ii) become good person. This is the\npath to fulfilment, or tao, as it is called.\nQi gong thus identifies physical health as a main concern, which you will probably agree\nwith from your own experience. It is hard to\nbe happy when you feel a lack of energy, feel\ntense or something else is wrong with your\nhealth. It is also hard to achieve happiness\nwithout love. In the words of a famous taiji-quan master: Chang San-Feng,\n...to those who want to know the way to\ndeal with the world, I suggest, love people.\nA westerner approaching qi gong will\nencounter some thresholds. The most obvious one appears when a master explains why\na certain exercise is performed. Chinese philosophy argues that everything has a corresponding antithesis (yin-yang). Hot defines\ncold, long short, for a sunny side there is a shade etc. Tension between the poles drive\nchange, e.g. weather effects between high\nand low temperatures or pressure. The interchange between the two is categorised into\nfive elemental phases which need to be har-mon is ed to achieve balance and health.\nWestern science will agree with some conclusions formed within this framework, like\nthe inter-change ability between matter and\nenergy but in general these ideas sound\n'unscientific' to someone schooled in a different environment.\nJust to open your mind to the possibility\nthat qi gong may work, consider that these\nideas have been tested in a quantity and over\na time-period that dwarfs the western medi-cine. Consider also the well-documented\nresults these methods have had on some\npatients considered terminal by western\nmedicine. Can it not be the case that these\ntwo sciences can learn from one another?\nSadly, although some are open minded to\nteachings expressed in a different theoretical\nframework to their own, there is often dogma\nwhen sciences collide. Stories about priests\nrefusing to look at the results of experiments\nbecause they are not in the bible come to\nmind.\nn nm The tension between traditional\nI Chinese science and western sci-Ien ce is also clear in China today.\n1 The Chinese government is pushing\nfor proliferation of western science\nand seeks to diminish superstitions\nin the populous. As a western scientist you would probably find\nsome of the ideas circulating in\nChina unscientific, as would many\nqi gong masters. It is important\nthat perceived superstitions are\nmet by arguments and evidence\nrather than oppression, like in the\ncase of falun gong, lead by a man-with political ambitions - referred\nto as a charlatan in government\nleaflets. Note that apart from some\nsuperstitions, there is serious med-cal knowledge in China recorded\nand tested over thousands of years\nthat should not be denied the\nfuture world.\nThe first time I personally\nencountered the qi, a Taoist concept similar to energy, was during a gap year in China. A doctor and tai-\"i quan master performed movements around me and behind my\nback that I could feel from meters\naway. I thought long and hard\nabout whether I could be fooling\nmyself but have not arrived at a reasonable explanation. There appears to be\na physical, objective reality behind these\nideas. Western scientists are succeeding in\nexplaining some of these sensations in terms\nof electromagnetism, but a complete incorporation of observed phenomena into western\nscience might require expanding the currently accepted limits of the mind's power over\nenergy.\nGo to some qi gong classes with Prof. Zhao\nand try for yourself. Properly trained, you will\nlearn how to feel good, get more energy and\nmove towards fulfilment. You will also get an\nunderstanding of a different approach to the\nworld.\nfelix@ic.ac.uk The student newspaper of Imperial College\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX COLUMNS07 Alex Says..\nI'd love to be able to cook properly and healthily. My diet over\nthe last two years has consisted\nmainly of ready meals, crisps,\nchips, burgers, kebabs and pies.\nEspecially pies. They're easy to\nshove in the oven and damn\ntasty, but they haven't done\nmuch for my physique.\nOf course, when I came to uni-vers it y,I was a great muscular\nhunk of a man with biceps the\nsize of trees and capable of lifting\ncar parks. Honest. But now I'm just a great lard y chunk of a man\nwith biceps the size of pencils,\nand barely capable of picking up\nanything much bigger than a pint\nof Guinness.\nI have tried to eat more health-i ly. One day I went to the super-market, and I bought four lovely\ndeep-green Granny Smith apples,\nfive nice ripe bananas and a kilogram of potatoes.\nThree weeks later I threw out\nfour light-green apples which\nnow resembled the bland\n\"Golden Delicious\" variety. I'm sure this is how they are cultivated - if a supermarket hasn't sold\na load of their tangy, flavour some Granny Smiths by their Use By\ndate, just leave your them out in\nthe warehouse for a couple of\nsmelt as far away as Amersham.\nI thought I'd scrap the fruit and\nvegetables plan and decided to\nconcentrate on doing actual\ncooking. I got \"How to Cook\" by\nDelia Smith. She was arrogant\nenough to try to tell me how to\nboil an egg! Well, I tried it.\nSeveral boxes of eggs later, I had\nprobably successfully cooked\nFood!\nweeks, and voila, a truckload of\napples with all the flavour of\nsoggy newspaper which you can\nlabel \"Golden Delicious\".\nThe kilogram of potatoes was\ntrying unsuccessfully to pretend it\nwas a house plant, and, following\nseveral letters of complaint, I threw out the five brown mushy\nbananas which could now be\nenough which weren't cracked or\npractically raw to finally have\nsome breakfast.\nHowever, by this time it was\n6pm. So I turned the page. \"Egg\nand Lentil Curry with Coconut\nand Picked Lime\". Hmm, steady\nnow Delia - you've devoted the\nbest part of a whole tree telling\nus how to cook an egg and now\nI'm supposed to have things like\n\"3 cardamom pods, crushed\"\nand \"turmeric powder\"? I thought\nI was taking it seriously when I made the special trip to buy eggs\nfor the first time ever, and now\nyou're expecting somebody who\ncan't cook at all to have a full\nspice rack?\nI think I 'll stick to the pies. My\narteries may completely seize up\nwell before I go to pick up my\nfirst pension payment, but at\nleast I 'll have had 50 years of\nfool-proof, reasonably tasty\nBritish cuisine, rather trying to\nperfect one of Delia's mad\nrecipes. And how would I cope\nwith becoming an old man any-way? Old people smell funny,\nwatch Countdown, spend all day\ncomplaining and have all the\nstrength of a particularly feeble\ngerbil.
