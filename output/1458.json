We sat in\nthe comfortable VIP seats and settled in for an hour and three quarters\nof awesome action and maybe some\nthoughtful dialogue - after all, the main\ntheme in the story was supposed to be\none of redemption. What followed\nwas an orgy of \u2018oh-no-he-didn\u2019t\u2019, pre-asskick, trashtalking interspersed with\nhammy expressions of overwrought\nguilt and ultimately, a resolution that\njust seemed far too easy. I can only\nimagine that the aerial shot of Kane\nstanding, arms wide, legs at shoulder\nwidth, asking of the heavens \u201cWhat do\nyou want from me?\u201d was supposed to\nbe wrenching; it left me unaffected or,\nif anything, a bit embarassed for James\nPurefoy, the actor in the title role.\nDespite all this, there were a few\npositives. I enjoyed the way that visual imagery of the scene leading up to\nthe climax echoed the story\u2019s opening and there is also some pretty good\nswordplay in the film. The surroundings and visual effects were impressive\ngiven the rather modest $40m budget,\nthough the appearance of what resembled a Balrog was cause for concern\n(while we\u2019re on this subject, I\u2019ve also\nseen Gollum where he has no business\nJe T\u2019aime le John Wayne\nA wonderful little tribute/\nspoof of French New Wave\nfilms starring My Family\u2019s Kris\nMarshall who models himself\nafter Jean-Paul Belmondo from\nGodard\u2019s Breathless.

It was\nnominated for an Oscar but\nunfortunately lost to The New\nTenants.\nhttp://vimeo.com/9758104\nLa maison en Petit Cubes\nIn this beautifully drawn Oscar\nwinning animated film, an old\nman desperately tries to keep\nabove his flooded town by\nadding floors to his towering\nhouse.

Short films\nare vital for new filmmakers to get in\nthe business and hone their skills. Animated shorts are especially important\nas the finances required to produce a\nfeature length film are never small.\nMaking a short film is still a large\nproject and is by no means the easy\noption. A story must have a beginning,\nmiddle and end and condensing all the\nemotions and actions present in a full\nfeature into a ten minute film requires\na special skill. Films can range from innocent comedies to dark thrillers and\nthe great thing is you can watch them\nduring your lunch break.\nThe Internet holds a vast library of\nshort films, from Oscar winners to\nschool projects. Some of these have\nbeen uploaded with the filmmaker\u2019s\nconsent whereas others have been\nnaughtily put onto youtube. However\nI\u2019m not going to preach about the\nethics of file sharing, instead I have\ntrawled the World Wide Web in search\nof my favourite short films and a few\nclassics. I recommend Miracle Fish and\nLogorama as I swear you won\u2019t have\nseen anything like them before and I\u2019ve\ngiven the URL for each film.

The legislation,\nwhich set out to force greater disclosure and restrain pay in these sectors,\nhas been seen by the industry and government as being overly onerous.\nBrown has managed to postpone the\nvote on these measures until after the\ngeneral election, which many expect\nto fall on May 6th. The Prime Minister\u2019s personal intervention on the vote,\nwhich was to be held at a finance ministers meeting, has pushed back the\ndate of the likely British defeat on the\nmatter, but has presumably done little\nelse.\nBritain and it\u2019s\ninvolvement\nAn estimated 80% of\nEuropean hedge funds are\nbased in London, along with\n60% of private equity firms.\nApproximately $2,702bn\nis managed in Europe by\nalternative investment funds\nat the end of 2008.\nThis\nweek\nLords vote to bring\ndown internet pirates\nThe House of Lords has\npassed the Digital Economy Bill after a 2nd vote\nwhich incorporated several changes. The legislation\noriginally contained the\nability to rapidly change\nlaws on online copyright\nwithout further change of\nlegislation. Theformofthe\nBill which has now been\npassedallowsforCourtsto\nforce ISPs to block certain\nwebsites which are used for illegal file sharing. The proposals\nremain controversial and meet opposition from BT, Google and\nFacebook who all believe the Bill is unfair and users should be\nfined rather than banned if they persistently share files.\nGovernment Climate\nChange Exageration\nNowadays Dennis\nSkinner is quite similar to most MPs. The\nman who once held\nthe position of chair\nof the Labour Party\nstill maintains some of\nthe fire that earnt him\nthe name the \u2018Beast of\nBolsworth\u2019. In a House\nof Commons debate\nover the BA workers strike Skinner felt\nhe had been interupted by the Speaker, John Bercow, and\nasked why \u201cyou only stop me and not the others?\u201d. Following an attempt to bring back order from the Speaker, Skinner again jumped in with \u201cyou do plenty of interrupting\u201d.\nThe Beast of\nBolsworth strikes\nThe Advertising\nStandards Authority\n(ASA) has banned two\nadverts made by the\ngovernment to raise\nawareness of climate\nchange. The adverts in\nquestion used a nursery rhyme format with\na doomsday-esque\nmessage of climate\nchange. The ASA ruled\nthat the adverts went\nbeyond realms of current scientific concensus and as such\nshould no longer be used. Ed Milliband, the Climate Secretarydefendedtheadvertssayingthathehadanobligationto\n\u201cto explain how people can make a difference themselves\u201d.\nHedge funds make their money in\nthe somewhat shady area of alternative investments. By using a variety of\nfinancial tools and wizardry, they seek\nto create sizeable profits for their in-vestors. Investors are typically wealthy\nindividuals who have to meet certain\ncriteria, and in exchange for meeting these criteria the fund is exempt\nfrom some regulations which ordinary\nfunds have to comply with.\nIt is unlikely that Brown would have\ntaken action if it was the banks in the\nfiring line. Public anger against the\nlarge banks has somewhat died down\nas the economy recovers, but the\nmemory remains. Less people know\nwhat a hedge fund is, so Brown is able\nto act to defend this incredibly profitable (and taxable) business without\nharming his reputation with voters.\nJames Lees\nJames Lees Politics Editor France and Germany are leading the\ncoalition of EU nations seeking to push\nthrough the change. The Spanish press\nseems to have invented some kind of\nconspiracy of \u2018Anglo Saxon speculators\u2019 who are the cause of all the\nworld\u2019s problems, or at least Spain\u2019s.\nThis makes it more surprising that Mr\nZapatero of Spain, who currently holds\nthe rotating EU presidency, agreed to\npostpone the vote. The reason is likely\nto be the close ties Brown has built\nwith Europe.\nThe Conservatives are less \u2018in\u2019 with\nEurope so would likely have not been\nable to do this. The Conservative\nspokesman for the City, Mark Hoban,\nhas said that Brown had to plead for\nthe deferral as he had failed to dilute\nthe directive at an earlier stage. The\nConservatives say that they would base\na Treasury minister in Brussels to keep\ntrack of legislation.\nThe move of delaying the vote was\nwelcomed by people in the industry\nsuch as Javier Echarri of the Venture\nCapital Association who has been\nquoted as saying \u201cFurther work is\nneeded on this draft law and ministers have recognised that\u201d. How much\nlonger British interests can be defended from Europe is a key issue for the\nCity, but whether it will be a key issue\nfor the electorate remains to be seen.\nThe general election is expected to\nbe held shortly after we come back\nfrom the Easter break. If by some\nfreakish political manoeuvre the election is held over Easter, I would implore you to read the manifestos of the\nparties and remember that who you\nvote for genuinely does matter.\n\n"

If pos-sible, try to remember the description\nof any suspicious persons seen around\ncampus. Sourced from live.cgcu.net\nAn Imperial College international student found guilty of fraud has been\nimprisoned for six months and threatened with deportation, throwing fresh\ncontroversy on the College\u2019s policy of\nmonitoring students.\nMinzheng Du, a 28 year old Chinese\nnational in his second year of postgraduate studies, attempted to take an English language entrance examination for\nthe University of Warwick on the behalf\nof another person last December. He\nwas able to provide falsified identification in order to achieve this; however,\nhe made the critical error of providing\nexam invigilators with a passport photo\nthat looked entirely dissimilar to his\nown face.\nDu was one of a group of three individuals who were arrested and sentenced in February in connection with\nfraudulent behaviour concerning the\nsame examination. A statement from\nthe Imperial College Press Office confirms that, \u201can international PhD student at Imperial has been convicted of\na fraud offence and given a custodial\nsentence, following which he is due to\nbe deported from the UK. Since he will\nno longer be present to complete his\ncourse he has now ceased to be a student of the College.\u201d\nQuestions have been raised as to how\nDu was allowed to operate illegally outside of Imperial despite the College\u2019s\nstringent policy on ensuring that the\nattendance of international students\nmeets high government standards.\nNewly introduced for the 2009-2010\nacademic year across all UK universi-ties, the UK Border Agency\u2019s (UKBA)\nPoints Based Immigration System stip-ulates, by law, that the College report\nwhen a student misses 10 \u2018expected\ninteractions\u2019\n. These can range from arranged meetings with staff to work\ndeadlines.\nThis news is unlikely to benefit the\ncollege\u2019s standing with UKBA. Official\nmaterial from the College states that it\nis now \u201ca College regulation that students are required to attend to the satisfaction of the Head of Department\u201d. The\nCollege has taken it upon itself to make\nsure that the scheme applies to non-international students as well.\nThe Department of Computing, of\nwhich Du was a student of, has been\nunwilling to comment on Du\u2019s attendance in college before the incident in\nDecember, casting further suspicion on\nthe suitability of the regulatory system.\nUKBAs involvement in university\npolicy across the country has not been\nwithout its share of criticism.\nAshley Brown, current Imperial College Union President, voiced his disapproval of the introduction of the system\nin a sabbatical blog post on the union\nwebsite last year, citing that \u201c[it] looks\nset to be an exemplar of incompetent\nbureaucracy\u201d\n.\nMatt Colvin\nMatt Colvin\nThe Huxley Building where Computing student Minzheng Du worked\nComputing student imprisoned\nLawrence Weetman\nLawrence Weetman Live! Editor\nUniversity chiefs\u2019 salaries soar\nThe salaries of senior university staff\nhave come under scrutiny after it has\nemerged that certain salaries have\ndoubled or even tripled over the last\ndecade, far overtaking the salary increase of the average higher education\nteaching professionals.\nThe positions that are seeing this\nswell in pay are mostly the vice-chan-cellors within universities, who are effectively the heads of the university, as\nwell as academic administrators, medical consultants and scientists.\nIt has been found that there are currently 80 vice-chancellors who earn\nmore than the Prime Minister, including Imperial\u2019s ex-Rector Sir Roy Anderson, some of whom saw pay rises\nof 15-20% last year alone, compared to\nthe average higher education teaching\nprofessionals\u2019 45.7% pay rise over ten\nyears.\nThis dramatic rise in salary amongst\nsenior higher education staff has been\ndescribed as being hidden \u201cbehind the\nclandestine world of remuneration\ncommittees\u201d. Such committees are set\nup by each university to decide on the\nsalary of staff by making comparisons\nwith the salaries of other higher education institutions.\nThe comparable average salary between all the institutions continually\nincreases due to competition between\nthem for the best staff, as well as there\nbeing simply a greater number of uni-versities. It is also said that these educational remuneration committees\nmake comparisons to private and commercial organisations, which generally\noperate very differently to educational\ninstitutions, and therefore offer much\nhigher salaries.\nCombined with the state funding\nthat educational institutions usually receive, top academics are seeing\ntheir pay packets grow, amidst surveys\nshowing that two-thirds of vice-chan-cellors believe tuition fees should be\nincreased to \u00a35000.\nThe idea of higher tuition fees for\nstudents will no doubt serve to balance out the cuts that all universities\nwill face, and it is feared that junior\nlecturers will experience redundancies\nas a consequence of the salary increase\namongst senior staff as well as the ominous funding cuts.\nThe universities justify the soaring\nsalaries of senior academic staff by arguing that competition amongst universities requires an appealing remuneration to attract the best academics\npossible. Therefore, they argue that the\nremuneration packages should also reflect these demands.\nJoanna Cai\nJoanna Cai\n\u00a3132,923\nPrime Minister Gordon\nBrown\u2019s annual salary\n\u00a3429,000\nImperial College Rector\u2019s\nannual salary\n\n"

Building\non the success of the past\nfour years it will be a unique experience bringing together the very best\nof theatre, comedy, literature, film, po-etry, dance, art, fashion, cabaret and of\ncourse music for four days in July on\nthe glorious Sunrise Coast of Suffolk.\nThe music will be the focus for most\npeople going, and this year\u2019s recently\nannounced line-up is effectively a wet-dream for any indie-rock fan. Florence + The Machine will grace the\nstage with their chart-topping brand\nof pop on Friday 16th. Belle & Sebastian, one of the better things to come\nout of Scotland along with whisky, will\nbring their wistful pop to the main\nstage on Saturday 17th, alongside British depresso-pop sensations The xx.\nBrooklyn pretty boys Grizzly Bear\nand Franco-English beauty Charlotte\nGainsbourg will churn out some saucy\nsongs on Sunday 18th, before Vampire\nWeekend bring the festival to a close\nwith kick-ass tunes from their recent\n\u201cContra\u201d outing. And these are just\nthe headliners, with many, many more\n(and probably more interesting\u2026)\nbands to be announced.\nComedy legends like Emo Philips\nand Ardal O\u2019Hanlon (also known as\nFather Dougal McGuire from Father\nTed) will be sprouting nonsensical sidesplitting gibberish on one side of the\nforest whilst the Royal Opera House\nand Royal Shakespeare Company\nprance around in tutus and call each\nother \u201cfilthy bungs\u201d across the lake.\nYou could sit by the waterfront and\nwatch degenerate hippies in a performance of \u201cHair: The Musical\u201d or\nget away with a cheeky game of grab-arse at the Masked Ball in the Faraway\nForest but if you prefer your art a tad\nmore freaky, then Latitude has something for you too baby: punk performance poet John Cooper Clarke will\ndiss the Man straight up at the Poetry\nArena, and provocative homo-erotic\ncabaret troupe Duckie will get you all\nhot and flustered late at night.\nUnless you\u2019re some kind of douche\nthen there is definitely something for\nyou at Latitude Festival, whether you\nare going with your whole family or\njust your ravenous gang of dope-fiend\nbuddies.\n\u201cMore than just a music festival\u201d is\nindeed one way of putting it, as you\nrun across the woodlands among orange and pink-coloured sheep wearing\nnothing but your boxers. It may sound\nlike an acid trip, but this is just one of\nthe many ways to appreciate this diverse and brilliant festival.\nIn fact it is a festival like no other in\nBritain. Featuring over 700 performers across four stages, it is closer to the\ncontinental European festivals where\nthe focus is not necessarily on the few\nfamous bands headlining, but rather\non the lesser-known acts that you have\nnever heard of - whether it\u2019s a random\nband, theatre performance or purple-coloured sheep. (Seriously they paint\nsheep at this festival \u2013 why wouldn\u2019t\nyou go??)\nLatitude is exceptionally well con-ceived. The organisers have fully comprehended the spirit that made early\n70s festivals like the Stonehenge Free\nFestival joyous and extraordinary gath-erings, and assimilated the financial\nand logistical implications of letting\nloose thousands of delirious people in\na field without it turning into a bloody\nriot. So instead of travelling to some\nshithole in South-East Asia this sum-mer, just go to Latitude \u2013 I\u2019ll say it one\nmore time, they have purple sheep!!!\n- Greg Power\nFABRIC 51\nDJ T\nFABRIC\nCOMPILATION\nThe press release for DJ T\u2019s Fabric mix\ninforms me that \u201cthere are very few\nwho can be fairly categorised as a true\nmusic lover more than ... DJ T.\u201d and his\nCV is impressively filled with owning club nights, setting up labels with\nself-confessed electronic music obsessives and creating and editing a seminal dance music magazine. The dark\nambience and oppressive lyrics of the\nopening track provide a beautiful start\nto this obviously eclectic mix. The\nmix develops tantalisingly slowly, with\nmore beeps, bass notes and drums being introduced in the next few tracks.\nEventually, DJ T brings in a sunnier,\nmore open ambience and at times I\nfelt I had literally been transported to\nTEENAGERS IN\nTOKYO\nPETER PAN\nBACK YARD\nSINGLE\nI liked this after three seconds and\ngot bored after three listens. It would\nfit comfortably in a Kitsune Compilation and has a remix by the Horrors to\nsuper-size your super-sceney needs; so\ncome on kids, pop this on your tape\ndeck and pretend you didn\u2019t reject\nUCL. You know you could have been\ncool and that\u2019s all that matters.\n- Lily Le\nCould you give a quick overview\nof how you got into dubstep and\nproducing?\nWell I went to uni, about ten years ago\nnow, and I was really into drum and\nbass. We used to dj drum and bass, or\njungle back then, and then my friend\nwho I\u2019d hooked up with at the time\nsaid we should start making tunes.\nWe started to make drum and bass together on a shit program called \u2018rave\ndj\u2019\u2026 from there we started giving our\ntunes out and playing them out. They\nsounded pretty whack but we still\nplayed them and we were convinced\nthey were good.\nI hooked up with RSJ who lived in\nSheffield where I studied. I used to\ngo round and play my tunes to him.\nHe would say that I should start using\nproper stuff, at that time \u2018Reason\u2019 had\njust come out so I got my first copy and\nworked up from there really, got my\nhead around the programme and then\nwe moved into cubase and RSJ taught\nme a few things on there and I taught\nmyself really, like I\u2019m doing right now.\nI\u2019m just sat here watching some tutorials on how to use \u2018Massive\u2019 (a plug-in\nby Native instruments).\nHow did the group Virus-Syndicate\n(MRK1 and MCs JSD, Goldfinger &\nNika D) come about?\nVirus-Syndicate is my group that has\nin the next few years?\nI reckon that there\u2019ll be a lot more dubstep vocal tunes, which might possibly\neven start going into the charts but\nhopefully they\u2019ll keep dark. Obviously\nyou\u2019ve had a couple of tunes in the\ncharts recently. The sort of tunes that\nyou wouldn\u2019t necessarily think were\ndubstep. Chase and status have had a\ncouple of tracks on Rhiannas new album and some of those were dark dubstep tunes originally but because they\nwere made more mainstream you don\u2019t\nnecessarily know if they\u2019re dubstep.\nDo you see it as a problem having\nmainstream dubstep chart releases?\nI think it depends on what the tune\nis, it can be positive. The worst thing\nwould be if we started getting watered\ndown dubstep entering the charts and\nif that became the dubstep brand. If\nit continues being the dark dubstep\nwith heavy baselines which are out and\nabout at the moment and they go into\nthe charts, thats not necessarily a bad\nthing, [it] just depends on who\u2019s vocal-ising them. Obviously if you get cheesy\npop acts covering dubstep tunes then\nits not going to give a good image. I\nreckon it would kill it off pretty quick,\nbut if you get reputable artists doing it,\nthen it could be a good look.\nInterview by Jack Massey\nLAURA\nMARLING\nDEVIL\u2019S SPOKE\nVIRGIN\nSINGLE\nI wish Laura Marling was dead. I joke, I\njoke! I say this only out of pure love for\nthe fact that she still makes me insanely\njealous of her poetic command. Love,\nreally! A sinister guitar resonance accompanies her vocals which are more\nfierce than ever, and effortlessly gets\nacross the message that she is not here\nto fuck around.\n- Lily Le\nBeing a dubstep DJ essentially means\nyou live a life controlled by the words\n\u201cwhomp-whomp\u201d\nbeen about since the start. We\u2019re all\nmates that live in Manchester. We\u2019ve\njust signed a tune to Defected records,\nwhich is a house label but we\u2019re officially signed to Strictly Rhythm which\nis the UK version, where we have\nsigned a single called \u2018Move It\u2019. I don\u2019t\nknow if you remember \u2018Reel to Reel - I\nLike To Move It\u2019 from back in the day.\nWe\u2019ve done a different version of\nthat, gave it to a few people, it got back\nto the label and eventually went to Eric\nMorillo (owner of Defected records)\nwho produced the original. He gave\nit the go ahead, so we signed up with\nthem. We\u2019ve got a few different tunes\ncoming out but thats the biggest one.\nYou own Contagious Records, whats\nlined up for 2010?\nI\u2019ve got my album coming out in April\ncalled \u2018Sound of Contagious\u2019. It\u2019s a\ncompilation of all the good Contagious\nreleases... well they\u2019re all good so the\nmain contagious releases over the past\nfew years on CD format. It\u2019s not just\nme on there, there are tunes from people like Skream, Chimpo, Jack Sparrow, RSJ, just different people. We\u2019ve\ngot a new Virus album coming out as\nwell in April and apart from that just\nthe usual singles by myself at the mo-ment, MRK1\nOut of all of your releases, which one\nstands out as your favourite?\nIt changes all the time, I often get bored\nof listening to my own tunes but \u2018Talk\nto Frank\u2019 is pretty recent and one of my\nfavourite ones. I got the samples from\none of the \u2018talk to frank\u2019 adverts, it was\nrecently used on the tv programme\nSkins.\nWhere abouts are you playing over\nthe next couple of months?\nI go on tour to America on the 10th of\nApril, for 3 weeks, starting off in Austin at the South by South-West festival and then up to Washington, then\ndown to Houston, Chicago and then\nback for another set at South by SouthWest. Then all the dubstep heads that\nare at South by South-West will be going out out to the Miami Winter Music Conference and I\u2019m playing about\n6 or 7 sets out there. Every night we\u2019re\ndoing different sets out there like pool\nparties.\nWhich artists and which tracks in\nparticular should we look out for in\n2010, or is it hard to tell until after\nthe Winter Music Conference?\nWell that will be what decides it; all the\nbig DJ\u2019s and producers will be out there\nplaying their new tunes and because\nit\u2019s big crowds you\u2019re playing to, it\u2019s\neasy to see how good the tunes are going down. But from what I\u2019ve listened\nto recently, I\u2019ve got some Doctor P new\ntunes and they\u2019re sounding pretty big\nat the moment. He\u2019s a pretty new guy\nbut he\u2019s got a good sound going on and\nthen Chimpo, who\u2019s signed to my la-bel, he\u2019s got some big tunes. He\u2019s been\naround for a while but I think that this\nyear he might take off a bit more. Also\nthere\u2019s DZ the American guy, he\u2019s really good and he\u2019s got some great tunes.\nHe\u2019s constantly releasing them.\nHow do you see dubstep progressing\nthe Mediterranean via the use of tasty\nMezze-style mixes of funk and Middle\nEastern singing.\nContinuing into this record, the audaciously named \u201cJesus Was a B-Boy\u201d\nintroduces a hip-hop element while\nstill managing to keep the flow and ambience of a house mix. Unfortunately,\nlike most fabric mixes, the vast eclecticism of collected sounds is the record\u2019s\ndownfall. I found myself wanting to\nkeep listening to songs of a particular\nstyle. The constant changing of styles\nand ideas makes feeling the groove of\na house set or being transported to\nBrooklyn for a Hip-Hop extravaganza\ndifficult. DJ T is obviously an awe inspiring musicphile and has picked\nsome groovy, funky and occasionally\nchilling tracks and this mix works well\nas an introduction of new artists to\nanybody wanting to find some chilled,\nambient music. As a dance mix, how-ever, I would prefer something with a\nlittle bit more identity. - Andy Roast\nWhere: Henham Park, Suffolk\nWhen: 15th - 18th July\nCost: \u00a3155\nwww.latitudefestival.co.uk\nWhy would I want to go?\nIt\u2019s the easiest way you\u2019ll get to see\nFlorence + TM and also they have\nawesome Arts and coloured sheep!\nMRK1 isn\u2019t going to let dubstep go soft anytime soon\n\n"

Initially edited by \u00c9ric\nRohmer (Maurice Scherer), it included amongst its\nwriters Jacques Rivette, Jean-Luc Godard, Claude Chabrol, and Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut.\nCahiers re-invented the basic tenets of film criticism\nand theory. A 1954 article by Truffaut attacked La qualit\u00e9 fran\u00e7aise (the \u201cTradition of French Quality\u201d) and was\nthe manifesto for the auteur theory \u2014 resulting in the re-evaluation of Hollywood films and directors such as Alfred\nHitchcock, Howard Hawks, Robert Aldrich, Nicholas Ray,\nFritz Lang, and Anthony Mann.\nCahiers du Cinema authors also championed the work of directors Jean Renoir, Roberto Rossellini, Kenji Mizoguchi, Max\nOph\u00fcls, and Jean Cocteau, by centering their critical evaluations on a film\u2019s mise en sc\u00e8ne.\nThe magazine also was essential to the creation of the Nouvelle\nVague (New Wave) of French cinema, which centered on films\ndirected by Cahiers authors such as Godard and Truffaut. The\nNouvelle Vague was one of the most influential film movements\never; it saw film as an art form instead of simple entertainment.\nThe whole medium of film was readdressed by considering screen\nlanguage, natural scripts and improvisation.\nThe Auteur Theory saw the director take sole responsibility for the\nquality of his film in the same way as an author of a book. Although\nNouvelle Vague fizzled out at the end of the 60\u2019s its spirit was taken up\nby the \u2018Brat Pack\u2019 directors of the New Hollywood movement during\nthe 70\u2019s. If it wasn\u2019t for Les Cahiers du Cinema, the film world would\nbe a lot worse for wear.\nAs part of the 100 Years of Cinema programme, organised especially\nto coincide with the centenary of the Institut fran\u00e7ais, 50 Years of Cahiers du Cin\u00e9ma will celebrate this legendary publication. Each decade\nwill be represented through a landmark film. This season also marks the\npublication of A Short History of Cahiers du Cin\u00e9ma by Emilie Bickerton,\nwho will discuss her book and introduce the screening of Pierrot le Fou on\n23 March.\ns gener\neral\na ly\nly reg\ngar\nard-d--d-New W\nWav\nave.\ne.\nee)\ndir.

We want the competitions\nto get bigger and better each year, to\nhelp our start-ups succeed and learn.\nSo we approach all kinds of companies\nfor our prizes. eOffice, a very funky hot\ndesking company provide office space,\nConnect London, a fantastic organisation provide mentoring, and our cash\nprize is derived from a multitude of\nsponsors who support entrepreneur-ship. This year it\u2019s been mainly Microsoft and a grant from the Rector.\nThere is a lot of \u201cgeneric\u201d sponsorship available, but accepting them with\nvarious strings attached runs the risk\nof turning into a careers service when\nwe are actually promoting an \u201calternative\u201d so we must always maintain a\nhigh standard of sponsors.\nFor example, Microsoft are not so\ngeneric. They support students & entrepreneurs with programmes such as\nDreamSpark.com and BizSpark.com.\nDreamSpark provides FREE software\nto all students with a university email\naddress \u2013 worth thousands of dollars,\nand often provides the perfect tools to\nstart a technology company. You can\ncreate the next Facebook or twitter\nwith these kind of tools!\nTell us a bit about your own Company, Web-Port. Did you enter it into\nthe competition?\nWeb-Port (.co.uk) is a start-up I have\nwith my high school friend, (perhaps\nobscurely) centred around cargo man-agement. We entered it into Ideas Empowered last year (before I was on the\ncommittee) and although we didn\u2019t\nwin the competition the experience\nwas fantastic, which drove me to become involved in the committee for\nthe society. What the Ideas Empowered competition did for Web-Port,\nthrough mentoring and rigorous competition rounds, was make it a realistic\nand viable opportunity. However in the\nprocess it significantly scaled-up the\nsize of the business and thus requires\nfar more planning and research & de-velopment. So we plan to remain quiet\nwith this for a few years!\nJonathan has also been working on\nanother project:\nYearbook Builder (.co.uk) is a project\nI have been quietly working on for 3\nyears with a friend in Cambridge.\nIt is an online yearbook compiler,\nallowing students to very efficiently\nand socially create their yearbook.\nIt has recently come to fruition with\nsuccessful trials and external interest.\nWhat advice do you have to budding\nEntrepreneurs who may be looking\nto compete next year?\nJoin our mailing list! Our mailing list &\nblog is only getting better and better,\nit\u2019s a fantastic way to keep up to date\nwith current entrepreneur networks\nand news.\nNext, attend our events in the Autumn Term. We put on drinks and very\nsimple talks, from real entrepreneurs\nwho know what they are talking about.\nA significant part of my entrepreneurial ideas and thinking is from attending\nsuch events.\nIf you have an idea, submit it to the\ncompetition, and if you don\u2019t \u2013 attend\nour events to meet people with ideas\nto get involved. We also incubate for a\nMicrosoft Competition, Imagine Cup\n\u2013 who this year provided a list of problems directly faced by charities, and\nchallenged students to create sustainable models for success. This is a fantastic chance for someone to gain experience who isn\u2019t quite ready to push\non with their own ideas yet.\nAny final words for Imperial\u2019s budding entrepreneurs looking to join\nyour society?\nImperial Entrepreneurs receive a significant amount of internship offers for\nstart-ups, so you\u2019re not working for a\nBIG name, but you are given responsibilities for a critical component of a company\u2019s development. Your involvement can\nbe make or break. These opportunities\nare fantastic and we need to see Imperial\nstudents benefit more from these!\nMuzaffar Khan, professional mentor and Principal of Space Energy AG\nJonathan Webster\u2019s five favourites\nMove-IT\nMove-it is a simple kit of self-adhesive cardboard parts,\nwhich transforms a package into an easy-to-use trolley.\nLater London\nLaterLondon is a smartphone app guide to London\nnightlife featuring dynamic map displays and micro-reviews.\nSize-Connect\nA size recommendation engine for clothing: a revolution\nfor online retailers.\nPower-Fi\nGame Controlling Balls: Making a Game Controller out of\na Gyroscope.\nMedissential\nMedissential is a durable, water-proof, customisable wrist\nband that reminds children should they forget continuous-demand medical products like inhalers.\nThese companies, all started and run by students here at\nImperial, will be battling it out in the Ideas Empowered\nfinals: 6-8pm, Friday 19th March. Featuring: press\ncoverage, free refreshments, and brilliant ideas!\nGet more on all of these ideas on younoodle.com.\nO\nn Tuesday, Imperial\nCollege Finance Society\nhosted former banker\nand professional mentor Muzaffar Khan. He\ndelivered a talk on getting a front office\njob in the City. He started at the very\nbeginning, explaining that front office\njobs in investment banks are the rev-enue-generating ones such as trading,\nsales and research.\nThe audience covered a broad spectrum of students and Muzaffar offered\nsomething of value to everyone. At first\nhe explained the benefits of sitting at\nthe front of lectures and gave everyone\na minute to do so. He then elaborated\non this and gave audience members another opportunity. He then conjectured\nthat the number of people still at the\nback showed a key difference between\nstudents of Imperial versus the LSE. He\nestimated the average IQ at the two institutions at 120 and 150, respectively.\nYet he pointed out that LSE graduates\nenjoy higher average salaries and linked\nthis to egos rising with intellect.\nMuzaffar\u2019s interest in mentoring\nstudents began by helping his younger\nbrother pass GCSEs, expanded when\nfamily friends started asking for similar help, and later turned into a profession focusing on university students.\nTo date he has mentored over a thousand people, mostly from underprivileged backgrounds. But when he went\nto the LSE to gain a Masters in 2007,\nhe met many already successful people\nwho wanted his mentoring. At first he\nwas reluctant, but was persuaded to\nreconsider by their persistence. He realised that he could have more impact\nper student through focusing on people who had already achieved a lot, by\npersuading them to then try to make a\npositive difference to society.\nThe reason he talked so much about\nhis own experiences, he revealed at this\npoint, was because he wanted to structure his talk like a good interview. He\nsuggested interviewees start by demonstrating sound overall knowledge of\nthe financial industry. He argued that\nexhibiting specific knowledge of the\nfirm applied to should come next.\nSpecific information, such as the\nabsolute necessity of knowing the interviewing company inside-out was offered sparingly as Muzaffar instead focused on motivating students to have\nthe \u201chunger for success.\u201d He would not\nhave done it this way ten years ago, but\nfelt this to be a more appropriate approach now that we live in an age when\nalmost everything one needs to know\nis easy to find on the internet. Finally,\nafter establishing their thorough acquaintance with the financial industry and the firm to which they apply,\nhe asked interviewees to explain how\ntheir employment will deliver a marginal benefit to the bank.\nLast week felix mentioned this talk\nand reminded readers of a similarly\npopular event that included Muzaffar\u2019s\nmost successful mentee to date, Jan\nSramek. If you attended Tuesday\u2019s talk\nor missed it, but wish to know more,\ngo to racing-towards-excellence.com.\nThis website has contact details for\nMuzaffar, who will respond to further\nqueries.\nIn particular, Muzaffar offers one-on-one mentoring and also runs work-shops. These typically last five hours\nand are for groups of around eighteen\nstudents. The general workshop will\ncontain similar content to his talk but\ngoes into more individual examples\nfrom his mentees and those present.\nImperial College Finance Society President Craig Young attended one and\nfelt that it was a worthwhile event.\nMuzaffar Khan delivers talk to ICFS members\nIC Entrepreneurs Compete in Finals\nAhead of their biggest competition of the year, Imperial Entrepreneurs\u2019 Vice President is interviewed by felix\n\n"

    "content": "33\nfelix FRIDAY 19 MARCH 2010\nBUCS CHAMPIONSHIPS FEATURE\nsport.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nIncredible medal haul for Imperial Judo\nTen judo players travelled to Sheffield\nlast Friday to take on the best from\nacross the British Universities in the\nBUCS Championships. Team Imperial started excellently with Alexander\nMurphy winning a gold medal in the\nkyu grade (green and blue belt) divi-sion. Alex finished all his four fights\nwith an Ippon \u2013 the judo equivalent of\na technical knockout. Ualikhan Yesbolov, an ex-wrestler from Kazakhstan,\ndominated all of his six fights in the\nunder 81kg kyu grade category with\nsome nice shoulder throws and a huge\ncounter in the final. Tomasz Zamacinski (u90kg) reached the semi-final\nafter four comfortable wins then managed to win the semi-final ten seconds\nbefore time with a spectacular drop\nthrow. He won the final with a strangle to secure the 3rd gold medal for\nImperial.\nIn the Dan grade (black belt) division\nour two women\u2019s entries, Bronwyn\nDawson and Thalia Laing, were drawn\nin the toughest round-robin pools of\nthe u57kg and u70kg categories, re-spectively. Both lost to the eventual\ngold and silver medallists. In the men\u2019s\nu66kg and u81kg Dan grade catego-ries, team captain Wilhelm Kleiminger\nand Benjamin Browne also faced tough\nopposition and one win from each was\nnot enough to qualify them for the\nknockout stages.\nIn the u73kg black belt category\nwere Edouard Desclaux and Rahul\nBose. They both stormed through\ntheir respective pools, finishing first\nand winning all their fights by Ippon.\nProgressing well, Ed won his quarterfinal in a tough fight against a former\nFrench junior national player. Ed lost\nthe semi-final to a physically stronger\nBritish squad player placing him in a\nfight for the bronze medal, where he\nhad narrowly missed out last year. Ed\nswept his opponent of his feet, scoring Ippon to win his first medal at the\nBUCS Dan individuals.\nHaving previously won three individual bronze medals, Rahul Bose was\nparticipating in his final BUCS Championships. Using his dynamic judo he\nwon six fights and reached the final,\nwhere he fought the player who had\nknocked out Ed. Rahul started really\nwell, not allowing his opponent to set-tle, but was caught with a drop shoulder throw, which ended his day with an\nimpressive silver medal.\nAfter a tiring first day, we were back\non the mat for the team events. Our\nwomen\u2019s team (Bronwyn, Claudia\nCraven and Thalia) were unable to\nprogress from a tough pool including\nBath (gold) and Oxford (silver).\nOur men\u2019s team, consisting of Wilhelm, Alex (substitute for Wilhelm after the pools), Ed, Rahul, Ualikhan and\nBen, was keen to continue the success\nof the previous two years where Imperial had finished 3rd. A straight 5-0 win\nagainst Manchester and a 4-1 against\nGlasgow placed the team in the quar-ter-finals, where they faced a strong\nteam from Birmingham. After an overall tie (2-2), a single weight category\nwas drawn at random by the referees:\nIn a nerve racking decisive fight Rahul\nwon with a counter to keep his team in\nthe running for a medal.\nOnce again, in the semi-final, we\nfailed in the near-impossible task of\ndefeating Bath. Now we would fight\nfor the bronze against Loughborough\nwho fielded only four players meaning that we only had to win two fights.\nAlex outclassed his opponent then Ed\nbrought us the victory by winning a\nhard battle against an excellent Japanese player. Rahul followed with another win, bringing the score to 4-1 for\nImperial.\nThis was the most successful BUCS\nChampionships for the club since\nstarted to enter separately from the\nUniversity of London. Along with our\nwin with London A at USIST 2010 this\nended a great season for the Imperial\nCollege Judo Club. The club would like\nto thank Joe Doherty for his coaching\nand Sport Imperial for their support.\nWaterPolo:historicfirstwin\nFor the first time in Imperial College\u2019s\nillustrious history, the men\u2019s Water\nPolo 1st team won the BUCS trophy\nthis year. It was a hard fought victory,\nwell deserved after a long season. Unbeaten on the road to the final, the\nfirst game of three over the weekend\nwas potentially the hardest. Our first\nmatch was against Sheffield Hallam,\nwho despite coming second in their\nsemi final had a much stronger squad\nthan the other teams. This was proved\ntrue when during our tense encounter Sheffield were leading 10-7 going\ninto the final quarter. However, Imperial\u2019s tactic of working the opposition\nhard by pressing them in defence with\nquick counter-attacks on offence paid\noff. A quick flurry of goals including\nthose from Ian Welch-Phillips, Miles\nLindsey-Clarke and Tom Gannon with\nstrong defence from Brad Sanders and\nJohn Livesey brought Imperial back\nto 12-12 with one minute left on the\nclock. A strong attack lead to Imperial\ngetting the ball to resident GB water-polo player Adam Scholefield, who\nclinically smashed a shot past Sheffield\u2019s keeper. With 25 seconds on the\nclock, Imperial\u2019s solid defence stole the\nball back and held on to end the match\nat 13-12. The next day Imperial met\nPlymouth, the only team that Imperial did not gain full points from during the semi finals, but again superior\ntactics of coach Adam Walzer led to a\nconvincing victory of 23-11. The final\ngame was St Andrews whom Imperial\nbeat 17-13 with goals from Aly Mawardy, Tom Beales-Ferguson and Peter\nMason as well as good performances\nfrom goalkeeper Vlad Besprovany and\nJamie Lee. Imperial ended the season\nunbeaten with a first BUCS trophy of\nIC waterpolo history.\nIan Welch-Phillips Water Polo\nRahul Bose & Ben Browne Judo\n\n"

After a token effort at being sensible, Ed Balls\ndidn\u2019t so much cave in as implode.\nBetter to keep locking up ten-year-olds without question, he reasoned\n\u2013 God forbid we put any more of our\nprecious mums at risk of hurt feelings!\nIt goes without saying anyone would\ngenuinely sympathise with parents\nwho\u2019ve lost their kids in these circum-stances, and in the end I\u2019m sure these\npeople are mostly well meaning in\ntheir motives. But how can we expect\nto have a rational discussion on anything when the emotive comments of\nmother of xyz gets thrown into Britain\u2019s already potent blend of tabloid\npuke and child worship. This is made\neven worse now that experts face losing their jobs if they publicly disagree\nwith whoever is mum of the moment.\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, we all love our\nmums. However, we also know they\nsometimes don\u2019t know when to shut\nup.\nJPAMloveshismummy,justnotallmums...\n\u201c...it seems that a\nlarge portion of\nthe press can find\nno-one better to\ncomment than\nsome self-righteous\nmum\u201d\nC\nrossing the road the other\nday, a thought struck me,\nwhich is the safest thing to\nbe struck by when crossing the road.\nWhy is KFC called KFC? It stands\nfor Kentucky Fried Chicken, or at least,\nthat\u2019s what I thought. But if that\u2019s true,\nwhy shorten it? Easier to fit on a sign, yes,\nbut McDonald\u2019s doesn\u2019t have any trou-ble, and as appellations go, it\u2019s not much\nlonger. What exactly are they hiding?\nMaybe they\u2019re not called Kentucky\nFried Chicken anymore because that\u2019s\nnot what they are anymore. But what\nexactly are they not? Are they no\nlonger Kentucky? As far as I know, the\nbluegrass state hasn\u2019t suddenly slipped\n(over Virginia) into the sea.\nPerhaps, in an effort to promote a\nhealthier (not to mention environmentally friendly and multi-cultural)\nfast-food option, KFC decided not\nto fry their chickens, but bake them,\nor steam them instead. Kentucky\nSteamed Chicken does sound quite\nappetising. However, maybe they were\nafraid that unknowing students might\nconfuse the KSC on Gloucester Road\nwith Ko\u0161ice International Airport,\npride of Slovakian aviation. I can understand their concern; it\u2019s a surprisingly easy mistake to make.\nHowever, an experimental foray into\nthe establishment in question led me to\ndiscount this hypothesis. Not only did\nthe chicken turn paper transparent,\nbut it did strange things to my insides\nas well. I don\u2019t want to say that I now\nhave a see-through small intestine per\nse...but that meal has given me a whole\nnew perspective on the gastrointestinal system, quite literally.\nSo what\u2019s left? Kentucky Fried but\nnot Chicken? Surely not, that\u2019s patently ridiculous. At least, that\u2019s what I\nthought. But the leg:breast ratio doesn\u2019t\nwork out. KFC sells ten times as many\ndrumsticks as it does breast fillets. Using chickens, that amounts to a criminal waste of meat somewhere along\nthe line. And wasting meat is wasting\nmoney, and no self-respecting company of any size would be happy with\nthat. So what did KFC do? They turned\nto that great revolutionary, the force\nthat transforms eels into eagles, Evolution! (Cue thunder and lightning).\nAt its most mundane, evolution is\nsimply the accumulation of successive mutations over time. Occasionally, a mutation arises that will cause a\nchicken to grow a third leg. In the wild,\nthis would be selected against and the\nmutation, not to mention the chicken,\nwould soon die out. However, if you\nwant a chicken with three legs, you\u2019ve\njust won the evolutionary lottery. If instead you wanted a chicken with four\nlegs...well, you just have to wait for\nyour number to come up.\nNormally if you wanted to play God\nwith domestic fowl, you\u2019d have to wait\na few million years for the result, but\nwith a thousand battery hens dosed\nup on penicillin and amphetamines,\nstrange things happen on a rather\nshort time-scale. The same holds true\nfor boarders in Public School. KFC\ndidn\u2019t know what they wanted to create and certainly didn\u2019t know what they\nended up with but knew it would make\nmoney, and that was good. And on the\nsixth day, KFC uncreated the chicken\nand they saw that it was good.\nWhat they created can\u2019t be accurately described without breaking\nlanguage but let\u2019s have a go. It\u2019s...like a\nball, roughly, with breasts all over. Instead of feathers, it\u2019s covered in goose-pimples. Fat little legs shoot out at\nrandom angles. Are there fifty? A hun-dred? Who knows? It moves \u2013 it\u2019s free-range poultry \u2013 by constantly falling\nover. With no visible beak or cloaca, it\u2019s\nhard to tell whether it\u2019s upside-down\nor downside-up, or even leftside-right.\nIt sweats BBQ sauce.\nSo KFC succeeded in creating a new\nmoney-saving fast-food meat. But they\nhad a problem. What they created,\nno matter how genius in inception,\nwas by no stretch of the imagination\na chicken. By no definition could it\nso be called, not genetically and certainly not legally. They couldn\u2019t sell it\nas chicken, not unless they wanted it\nwith fries and a hefty lawsuit \u2013 which\nwent against the whole \u201cmake money\u201d\nbusiness plan. And they couldn\u2019t say it\nwasn\u2019t chicken. With people still getting their genomes in a twist over stem\ncells, they\u2019d blow their telomeres over\nthe world\u2019s first...whatever it was.\nSo KFC took the easiest route and\nquietly dropped the Chicken from\ntheir name. Goodness knows what\nthe C stands for now. With that over, I\nwonder how long it\u2019ll be before Texan\nChicken comes clean.\nRhysDaviesisn\u2019t sure about fried chicken...\n\u201cNot only did the\nchicken turn paper\ntransparent, but it\ndid strange things\nto my insides as\nwell.\u201d\n\n"

Many many\nmany thanks to all who came and/or\ncontributed to the event! It was a huge\nsuccess in terms of charity fundraising\nfor such a new and modest society.\nHowever, the more groundbreaking\nachievement was drawing in a substantial crowd of boogie-lovers to the Union on a Saturday night with barely 4\ndays of advertising AND smashing the\n\u00a3500 minimum bar spend on the late\nlicensed bar. Icing on the cake came\nfrom the many intoxicated and merry\nrevellers stopping to say \u201ccheers for the\nawesome music!\u201d on the way out.\nThe scale and impact of the event\nwould have surely doubled, if the event\nhad taken place on a Thursday/Friday\nnight. More money would have been\ncollected for a good cause. More people would be drawn in by the music for\na jive, and the Union would have made\neven more money on the bar.\nSo why is it so difficult to for clubs\nand societies to be given the chance to\nrun a prime-time Union night during\nthe week?\nMusic Tech is not the first society to\nface rejection when requesting to book\ndB\u2019s on Thursday or Friday evenings.\nOften the reasons for rejection are\nlargely down to money - the Union can\nnever afford to risk losing the modest\nbut steady income from its \u2018official\u2019\nscheduled events. However, although\nthis is an understandable cautious\nstance, the case for giving students a\nchance to entertain their kinsmen is\ncompelling.\nFirstly, clubs and societies are ruthless with their marketing because there\nare much deeper motivations than just\nmaking money. Clubs and societies are\nfilled with students passionate about\ntheir activities and keen to share their\npassions with others. This passion is\nwhat comes across when you are personally invited to club events; passion\nprovokes intrigue and at the very least,\nrespect for the effort put into whatever\nit is on offer.\nIn contrast, Union events are rarely\n(ever??) advertised in person or per-sonally. I get faceless Facebook invites\nto Union events that get deleted on impulse without a shred of guilt. Furthermore Union posters on the Sherfield\nwalkway are often just confusing with\nbusy colour schemes, randomly-titled\nevents and nothing new.\nSecondly, linked to the first point, the\nUnion do not give enough marketing\nsupport to club events. One has to applaud the efforts enabling club events\nadvertising on the Union website, but\neven this does not ensure space on the\nhomepage. Freshers are presented with\nan \u2018official\u2019 Union calendar each year\nthat does not hint at the possibility of\nclubs and societies putting on events in\nthe week. There should not be such a\nstark difference in advertising between\n\u2018official Union events\u2019 and club events\nbecause the students are the Union.\nThe \u2018official\u2019 posters on the walkway\nshould be in regular rotation with both\nclub and society events at the Union\n- even if they are on a Saturday. Also,\nthe TV screens in the Union could be\nused for the benefit of clubs and societies too.\nFinally, and most importantly, letting\nclubs and societies into the Union to\nput on events creates a diversity of entertainment reflective of the diversity\nof the student body. Instead of \u2018knowing what the Union has to offer\u2019, why\ncan\u2019t we have a Union where you\u2019re\nnever quite sure of how you\u2019re going to\nbe entertained? Yes, it\u2019s a risk for the\n\u2018Letting clubs and\nsocieties into the union to put on events\ncreates a diversity of\nentertainment reflective of the diversity of the student\nbody.\u2019\nMusicTech takes a bold leap in running an event in dB\u2019s. Their success should inspire more clubs to follow.\nprecious steady income, but the risk\ngoes both ways - there is a real opportunity to draw in spectacular numbers\n(and money) by marrying the efforts\nand resources of both the paid staff\nand passionate students. Above all,\nthis would stimulate a paradigm shift\nin attitude towards what the Union has\nto offer.\nI should stress that in order to justify this proposal, clubs and societies\nneed to show a level of discipline and\nmaturity in their events organisation.\nThis has never been easier than now\nwith the comprehensive Union Officers\u2019 Handbook and online wiki pages\nrammed full of useful events planning\ninformation. I encourage any other\nclubs and societies to publicise their\nsuccessful organisation despite not\nbeing able to run events in dB\u2019s during the week. Coupled with the full resources of the Union, these events can\nonly get better.\nMusic Tech hopes to put on many\nmore successful events offering a more\nstylised selection of music than the\nusual choice put on by the external DJs\non Union weeknights. Hopefully, more\nopportunities for clubs and societies to\nprovide entertainment to their peers\nwill arise with the opening of Metric!\nIf you\u2019re interested in what else\nMusic Tech Society has to offer\nplease email musictech@ic.ac.uk\n\n"

This is the first death as a result\nof rockets in three years and the thirtieth rocket to be fired\nthis year.\nThe attack came as the European Union\u2019s top foreign minister, Baroness\nAshton, visited Palestine and Israel to discuss the peace process; she is\nthe most senior European official to visit Gaza in three years. The peace\nprocess came into question last week when Joe Biden, U.S. Vice President,\nalso visited the region to re-engage negotiations: nearly simultaneously,\nthe Israeli government announced plans to build nearly two-thousand\nhomes in East Jerusalem, an area which has been a major point of contention since the Six Day War of 1967. Israel and the U.S. have had extremely\nheated exchanges over the past week; meanwhile, Baroness Ashton\u2019s visit\nhas put additional pressure on Israel. Gaza has been hurt badly since Egpyt and Israel instituted a blockade on the region, put in place because\nHamas refuses to agree to tenets set by international members of the\npeace process including Europe, Russia, and the U.S.\nThe world beyond\nCollege walls\nBy Tom Greany\nR\nussia and the United States came closer this week to another nuclear weapon reduction treaty.\nThe U.S. still has over two thousand weapons while Russia has\nover three thousand; the two countries last reached an accord\non the matter in 1991. At that time, both sides agreed to reduce eighty\npercent of all weapons and this reduction was finished in 2001. Both\nsides have now agreed in principle to reduce their numbers to slightly\nover 1,500. Sergei Lavrov, Russian Foreign Minister, and Hillary Clinton,\nU.S. Secretary of State, were due to meet Thursday to discuss the agreement whilst ministers worked behind the scenes to reach an agreement\non terms. Still under debate is how the reductions will be verified as\nwell as the Russia\u2019s displeasure regarding the U.S.\u2019s continuing plans for\na European missile defence system. On Wednesday, Ukranian president\nViktor Yanukovich promoted Kiev as the place for the eventual treaty to\nbe signed with the hope that Ukraine will be seen as a symbol of progress\nbetween Russia and the West.\nRussia & United States\nI\nraq\u2019s electoral commission delayed the release of the 7 March\ngeneral election results.\nThe two major candidates, Nouri al-Maliki, current prime minis-ter, and Iyad Allawi, former prime minister, have been in a heated\nbattle, with results expected to be very close. Allegations of misconduct,\nparticularly vote rigging, have been put forth by both sides. Maliki\u2019s con-tingent, called the State of Law, has demanded a complete recount of\nvotes, which the IHEC, the Iraq Higher Electoral Commission, has not\nagreed to. Instead, the commission, along with the U.N., states that the\nelection was fair and relatively free of manipulation. Voter complaints\nhave been low compared to past elections, including provincial elections\nearly this year. The majority of recent complains have come from Allawi\nsupporters, with the most recent available data showing him behind by\n40,000 votes. Maliki supporters\u2019 complaints have reduced dramatically\nas this data became available. It is currently unclear when IHEC intends\nto release the final vote count.\nIraq\nIsrael\nagainst Girton College, Cambridge on\nUniversity Challenge, the election results were announced.\nAlthough many thought the Presidential Election was down to Alex Kendall and Chris Darby, Serge Vasylechko\nstormed to second place, but fell short\nof 128 votes to the triumphant Kendall\nin the most tightly contested election.\nTarasov\u2019s mistake, that resulted in a\nblank manifesto on the voting website,\nwas evident in the final figure as he\nwas beaten by RON, finishing in last\nplace with 148 1st round votes.\nA victorious Kendall said: \u201cI\u2019m glad\nI now get the chance to show I meant\nwhat I said in campaigning. Still got\nbutterflies and adrenaline though.\u201d\nWhen questioned about his competition he singled out Darby as who he\nwas most worried about, but reckoned\nthat experience counted for a lot in the\nend.\n\u201cHe knows the Union very well and\nhe had a big support group. He was also\nthe first to put himself up for nomination and someone eager is always going to be a threat. We get on really well\nactually and I hope he\u2019s still around\nthe Union next year, but ultimately I\ndon\u2019t think you can call yourself experienced if you\u2019ve only completed one\nfull year at Imperial, regardless of how\nmany meetings you\u2019ve sat in. One day\nthough,\u201d he said.\nDarby was wary of the task ahead of\nthe elected team for next year.\n\u201cNext year is going to be incredibly\nchallenging for the Union. I sincerely\nhope that the current sabb team has\ntime to train all of next year\u2019s lot to\ntheir full potential and I look forward\nto another successful year for the\nUnion.\u201d\nVictorious Deputy President (Educa-tion) candidate Meera Ganeshadevan\nwas delighted despite only doubling\nRON\u2019s vote count.\n\u201cWinning feels great.... It still hasn\u2019t\nreally sunk in that I am DPE. I am sure\nit will feel more real once I start training and doing some work,\u201d she said.\nHeather Jones, who will be in charge\nof Imperial\u2019s 296 clubs and societies\nnext year described the announcement\nas \u201csurprising and overwhelming\u201d, adding that \u201cit took a long time to get over\nthe shock!\u201d\nThe Sabbatical team for the academic\nyear 2010/11 is a mix of experience in\nAlex Kendall, Heather Jones and Ravi\nPall, and fresh enthusiasm in Victoria\nMasding and Meera Ganeshadevan.\nPresident-elect Kendall said he was\nhappy with the team he\u2019ll be commanding next year.\n\u201cBy the time the President\u2019s election results were read out, the rest\nof the team were ideal so I lost all\nworry about that. It could have been\ndifferent.\u201d\nBeit Hall senior Victoria Masding\ntook a surprisingly calm approach to\ncelebrations despite a fierce battle between herself and Mike Richards for\nDeputy President (Welfare).\n\u201cI just had a few drinks and watched\nUniversity Challenge like everyone\nelse. Then I simply acknowledged\nmessages of congratulations on facebook in my room and had a big long\nconversation with a friend about unrelated topics. I\u2019m saving my celebrating for a house party!\u201d\nAfter his disappointment of losing\nthe Felix Editor election last year, current Music and News Editor Kadhim\nShubber has worked hard all year to\nsecure the Editorship for this following year.\nStudent Trustees Jaimie Henry,\nDavid Oliver, Melissa Lever and Hoi\nYeung were also elected.\nAlex Kendall\nUnion President 2010/11\nHow did you celebrate being announced as President?\nImperial Ale was the obvious choice. I\u2019ll be celebrating properly at\nthe weekend.\nWhat are you looking forward to most as President?\nSeeing all the Freshers integrate into the Union and College next\nyear. I think a big part of this is making the structure a bit easier to\nunderstand so it\u2019s easier to get involved. I also want to dispel the idea\nthat Imperial students are apathetic.

It was an amazing experience but what was even more amazing\nwas the response from the audience.\nEven Mr Editor-in-Chief Dan Wan was\nseen boogie-ing on stage with the rest\nof the cast and much of the felix team.\nSee! Dancing makes everyone happy!\nThe end of term is nearly upon us\nand we find ourselves faced with a\nmonth of revision otherwise known as\nEaster. So I thought I\u2019d have a look at\nwhat you can do artwise in the tiny excuse for a break your mum makes you\ntake when you\u2019re revising.\nMy favourite option is to race down\nto the piano and pound out a few\ntunes. My Dad is convinced he has\nto get the piano retuned everytime I\nreturn to college. Not only can I keep\nmy mind active with my mad sightreading skills but I\u2019m also pounding\nout all my revision frustration. Nice.\nIf you\u2019re not musically inclined why\nnot grab a pen and paper and have\na bit of a doodle. Take a look out of\nyour window and draw what you see\n(in my case this is an ugly bungalow\nand dog walkers, sigh). If you\u2019re feeling really frustrated why not go a bit\nabstract and start hurling paint-filled\nballoons. Then sell it to the Tate Modern and never have to work ever again.\nIf art isn\u2019t your thing you could always\ndo some writing. My blog always fills\nup when it\u2019s exam time as I prefer to\nthink of anything but Chemistry.\nThis week we\u2019ve gone a bit theatre-centric. But we\u2019ve stayed at Imperial to\ndo so \u2013 yay for Imperial Arts! There\u2019s a\nreview of Hair; I was in that so I\u2019m a bit\nbiased but Dan did just tell me it was\nthe best thing he\u2019s ever seen at Imperial. There\u2019s also a preview of Noises\nOff which is set to be just as awesome\nas Hair but with less dancing.\nI seem to know most of the cast so\nI\u2019ll definitely be going. I\u2019ve also taken\na look at the history of front row seats\nfor all you theatre history fans and anyone who likes to see the action when\nat a play.\n(Revision) could drive\na person crazy\nLucyHarrold\nLucyHarrold Arts Editor\nA\nTribal-Love-Rock musi-cal. It is perfectly fitting\nthen that ICU\u2019s Musical\nTheatre Society chose\nHair as their spring term\n2010 production \u2013 a musical written by young people, for young peo-ple. Daring, absurd, surreal, lewd and\ncrude all at once, Hair is also both fun\nand deeply political, tracking the lives\nof a tribe of New York hippies as they\nrebel against the government, \u2018square\u2019\nparents and the draft.\nWith book and lyrics by Gerome\nRagni and James Rado and music by\nGalt MacDermot, this colourful and\ngroovy show began life in 1967 off\nBroadway. Fast-forward to over forty\nyears later and it has enjoyed lengthy\nruns on both sides of the Atlantic as\nwell as countless recordings of the\nsoundtrack, a film adaptation and several awards. And for good reason too.\nMTSoc\u2019s production did glorious\njustice to the forty-odd songs that tie\ntogether the story of the Age of Aquarius tribe. Free love, free acid and free\nflowing hair abound but the looming\nthreat and arrival of the draft throw\nhippy Claude into moral indecision as\nhe deliberates over whether to resist\nthe draft or resist pacifism.\nKicking off with the brilliant \u201cAquarius\u201d, the cast conveyed the vibrance\nand energy of that time with their\nown never ending vibrance and energy\nmaking one marvel at just how talented the cast are, not only wrestling with\nscience degrees but also delighting us\nwith impressive voices and acting skills\nLet the sunshine in...\nCaz Knight embraces her inner-hippy at MTSoc\u2019s Hair\nafter many, many hours of hard work\nand rehearsals.\nThe whole cast were fantastic,\nmanaging to sing us numbers such as\n\u201cSodomy\u201d and \u201cI Got Life\u201d (now used\nin Muller adverts) at the same time as\nleaping around the stage, but within\nthem some truly incredible voices\nwere to be found \u2013 Ebitimi Alaibe\nas tribe member Dionne and Robert\nFelstead as main-man Claude with\nTosin Ajayi treating us to his wicked dance moves and James Brown\nimpression.\nThe costumes and wigs were equally wonderful as were the set and\nlighting. Musical director Zoe Humphries must also be commended for\nsteering the brilliant band through\nthe two-hour show that ended in an\non-stage, audience-inclusive Be-In to\n\u201cLet The Sun Shine\u201d.\nIf you have not got enough \u201cHair\u201d,\nthe West End production begins at\nthe Gielgud theatre on April 1st.\nMore than anything this awesome\nproduction should persuade everyone to indulge in more of MTSoc and\nImperial College\u2019s artistic offerings\nand performances.\nThe vibrant cast of Hair. Missed it? Well wah-wah boo-hoo that was silly.\nIt\u2019s a musical, of course there\u2019s got to be man love\nANOTHER CASTLE\nISSUE 4 IS OUT NOW!\nGRAB A COPY WHEREVER YOU\nCAN FIND FELIX!\n(R\nSORRY MARIO, YOUR GAMING\nSECTION\u2019S IN ANOTHER CASTLE!\n\n"

Did you no-tice? What with full sized lions walking about the place,\ncountless e-mails and even\nmore posters, even the \u2018worst ACC\nChair ever\u2019 noticed something big was\ngoing down. With the College side\nhaving already beaten the Medics once\nthis year, combined with the move to a\nnew location, it was guaranteed to be\nheated. But it\u2019s not all about the Rugby- I personally love the songs. These\nare not your typical loutish football\n\u2018who are ya\u2019 type, because first off that\ndoesn\u2019t even make sense.\nFor those of you who don\u2019t know, the\nrugby match is called the JPR Williams\nCup, after the great Welsh and Lions\nrugby player. And also for those of you\nwho don\u2019t know, JPR has recently been\nin the news for drink-driving. He tried\nto fool the breathalyser machine by\nsucking pennies, failed to do so, and\nreceived a 17-month ban. JPR is also a\nmedic.\nThe chorus of \u2018JPR give us a wave\u2019\nsoon rang out, and a wave was something JPR was not going to give. However this was something College had\nexpected and had prepared a digitally\nremastered version of the Monkees\n1697 hit \u2018Daydream Believer\u2019. It went\nlike so:\n\u2018Cheer up JPR,\nOh what can it mean?\nTo a coin-sucking Welshman,\nAnd his shit medic team.\n\u2019\nFantastic stuff, in fact almost poetic\nin nature, yet still the much-wanted\nwave was not forthcoming. College\nwere not beaten, and JPR was soon to\nbe told to book his taxi home. College\ngracefully reminded JPR that \u2018You\u2019re\nnot driving, you\u2019re not driving, you\u2019re\nnot driving anymore (anymore).\n\u2019 Which\nwas rather kind of us, as the very last\nthing we would want is for the poor\nman to have to got to court again. It\nwas at this point where some members\nof the crowd realised that if JPR was\nbanned from driving then he would\nno longer be needing the red Audi\ncabriolet in which he was stopped the\nprevious week. Rather than have this\nbeautiful car sitting unused, one college member offered to purchase it;\nthe best way to set this up would be to\nget 1000 people to chant \u2018JPR where\u2019s\nyour car?\u2019 over and over again.

Over the years we have been\ncollecting them together in a book\nalong with their meanings. We think\nthis would be a very popular tool for\npeople that want to know more about\nwords and want to understand us in\nconversation. It\u2019s not quite ready yet,\nthere are many words in the English\nlanguage (and even more if you count\nother languages but we agreed to not\ninclude these as it would make the\nbook too heavy), so it is taking some\ntime to put together but when it is\ndone we think it will make us lots of\nmonies.\nIn the course of their research, our\nexceptionally capable researchers\ncame across a lot of other interesting\nfacts about words, such as where they\noriginate from (their \u2018etymologies\u2019)\nand being exceptionally capable they\nmade notes. We\u2019re not going to include\nthese in the book so we\u2019re giving some\nof these to you for free.\nCAPABLE (adj.)\nUnsurprisingly this word comes from\nthe joining together of \u2018cape\u2019 and \u2018able\u2019\n(hence the pronunciation even though\nit looks like \u2018cap-able\u2019). It is used to\nrefer to things people can only do, or\nare better at, when wearing a cape. It\nis widely accepted to originate from\nsuperman, who was \u2018cape able\u2019 of\nflying when wearing his cape but had\nto walk to places when in normal\npeople clothes.\nIf you have a word whose origin you\u2019re\ninterested in, send it to us at sudoku.\nfelix@imperial.ac.uk and we\u2019ll put\nour research team to work on it.

    "content": "32 felix FRIDAY 19 MARCH 2010\nsport.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nBUCS CHAMPIONSHIPS FEATURE\nFencing fall short of a double victory\nIndy Leclercq Fencing\n\u201cWell done, and commiserations!\u201d\nThat sentence, uttered by one of the\nIC fencing club members to the Mens\u2019\nand Womens\u2019 teams upon their return\nto London, pretty much sums up the\nfencers\u2019 performances over the BUCS\nchampionships weekend.\nBoth teams had fenced extremely\nwell to get to the championship finals\nin Sheffield; making it into the top four\nuniversity teams in the country was no\nmean feat. However, falling just short\nof a gold medal left a bittersweet taste\nin everyone\u2019s mouth.\nThe men started off their championships with the semi-final match\nagainst Edinburgh University. A lucky\ndrawmeant that Imperial were able to\nfence in the order they wanted: the first\nmatch in the foil, the second in sabre\nand with epee rounding off the lot.\nRob Shaw, Colin Auclair and captain\nIndy Leclercq started off proceedings\nwith a very strong match, never losing\nthe advantage to eventually win it by\nseven hits, 45-38.\nThe sabre team, comprised of national fencers Maiyuran Ratneswaran\nand Henry Gann and resident Korean\nSeung-Wook \u201cWookie\u201d Lyeo put in a\nsolid performance after a slightly shaky\nstart to win by eight hits, 45-37.\nWith the team now ahead by fifteen points, the epeeists Marcello Colombino, Alessandro Costamagna and\nEd Gilhead just needed to stay level\nwith their opponents to win the match.\nImperial never dropped their lead and\nwon the match 45-42, for an overall\nscore of 135-117. They were now to\nface their premiership rivals Cambridge in the final.\nOn the adjacent piste, the Womens\u2019\nteam began their championships with\na semi-final against last year\u2019s winners,\nOxford. Indeed, the fixture had some\nhistory as Oxford pipped the girls to\nthe title by two points last year. Revenge was in the air. Ater beating Oxford twice in the premiership this year,\nthough, the girls made it past the dark\nblues once again, winning 113-101.\nCelebrations ensued as the IC women\u2019s\nteam joined the men in the final, the\ngirls fencing against Edinburgh. Imperial were, more than ever, up for the\ndouble.\nAfter a short wait, both teams were\ncalled to the piste for their respective\nfinals. The men got their preferred order again: foil, epee then sabre. This\ntime round, though, the foilists got off\nto a rough start. Trailing by five points\nfor most of the match, an inspired\npiece of fencing by Auclair got them\nback to just two hits behind. However,\nIC couldn\u2019t hold on and Cambridge\nproceeded to re-forge the gap. The\nmatch ended on a rather large defeat,\n45-32. Everything was yet to be done to\nas the sabreurs stepped up to the piste.\nUnfortunately the Cambridge team\nproved to be slightly stronger on the\nday, edging out Imperial 45-40. The\nIC boys were now trailing by eighteen\npoints overall, which meant that the\nepeeists couldn\u2019t concede more than\n27 hits. The match was unbearably\ntense, but in the antepenultimate bout,\nCambridge crossed the magic thresh-old. The championship was theirs.\nA similar story was unfolding across\nthe hall. The women\u2019s team went into\ntheir final full of confidence, but saw\ntheir hopes for a gold gradually eroded\nweapon by weapon, until they too were\nleft powerless against a very strong Edinburgh side.\nDisbelief and disappointment tinged\neveryone\u2019s faces. It was all over. After\nsetting their hopes quite high, both\nteams had stumbled at the very last\nstep. Settling for second was a hard\none to swallow, but both Cambridge\nand Edinburgh were the better teams\non the day. Lined up in their track-suits, looking every inch the part, the\nImperial fencers accepted their silver\nmedals, (as well as a fair play medal for\nMarcello Colombino and player of the\ntournament for Hannah Bryars) and\nrealized that second in the country\nwasn\u2019t, in fact, that bad at all. There\u2019s\nalways next year!\nThe fencing club would also like\nto thank Sport Imperial for the huge\namount of support they gave us over\nthe entire weekend, from the tracksuits\nto the mascots...Thanks guys!\ndiscDoctorsmakeDivision2final\nLast weekend the discDoctors traded\nLondon for Sheffield and the BUCS\nOutdoor Nationals, having qualified\nfor Division 2 .\nThe first game of the Saturday was\nagainst Trinity College Dublin. We got\noff to a slow start which allowed them\nto take a decisive early lead, and despite\nbringing it back to 8-8 we couldn\u2019t keep\nthe momentum going, and lost in sudden death.\nThe next game was against Aberdeen. We showed our quality by scoring easily and totally shutting down\ntheir offence for a comfortable 13-3\nPierre Mcarthy Ultimate frisbee win. More importantly, in the other\ngame in our group, Trinity lost to University of East Anglia, which created\nthe possibility of a three-way tie.\nKnowing we had to beat UEA to have\na chance to winning the group and an\neasier route to the final, we started the\ngame very well and took a commanding 5-0 lead. UEA didn\u2019t recover form\nthis, and we went on to win the game\n13-4. Because we trounced the other\ntwo teams in the group, our points\ndifference made us top of the group,\navoiding having to play an extra game.\nOur Quarter-final on the Sunday was\nagainst Durham in windy conditions\nwhich made playing difficult. We knew\nthat they were a good team and they\ndidn\u2019t disappoint, but we managed to\ntake the lead straight away before riding the rest of the game out, winning\n10-8. Next up were Stirling, which\nwas a very tight match. Nevertheless,\nwe managed to stave off our tiredness\ntowards the end to sqeeze a winning\npoint in and set up the final versus\nBath.\nLast year\u2019s second division champi-ons, their hard work ethic and good\nstructure gave them the edge. We put\nin one of our best performances of the\nyear and still were found wanting, with\nBath winning 6-9.\nSlightly disappointed at not winning\nDivision 2, we are still pleased with the\nperformances we put in. Special mention must go to the outgoing Captain\nand MVP Magnus Wilson who lead the\nteam to the Division 2 Indoor Nationals and to second place this weekend.\nDon\u2019t trust the massive grins, they were a bit disappointed. The mascots made it all better later that evening though.\n\n"

Every time I cross the English\nChannel, the empty suitcase on the\noutbound journey returns with a billion bottles of Happyderm.\nWeeks ago I was on the continent. I\nsearched and searched and there was\nno more. It has quite literally vanished\noff all shelves. Pharmacies, department\nstores, cosmetic boutiques... None of\nthem stock it anymore.\nHas L\u2019Oreal pulled my Happyderm\noff the shelves to make way for ex-pensive, and less effective skincare\nlines?\nI can see the red blotches and\npimples lurking in the corner, gleefully await the disappearance of the\nlast drop of Happyderm...\nIf you\u2019re from Europe, can you let\nme know if they still do Happyderm\nin your country? Email me at fash-ion.felix@imperial.ac.uk.\nGabriellaGentilcore\nGabriellaGentilcore Fashion Reporter\nNews Strip\nSpring Make Up Trends\nSo last week we looked at primers:\nwhat you do with them and what they\nare for. Now it\u2019s time to look at the full\ncoverage provided by foundation.\nWhen you\u2019re shopping for founda-tion, the best thing to do is to go to\nyour favourite department store and\nget them to apply the one you want for\nyou. Then you can wear it for the rest\nof the day and decide how well it stays\non, whether the colour tone is right\nfor you, and how it feels on your skin\n(does it make you skin feel greasy/too\ndry/break out?).\nHowever, they\u2019re not necessarily\nright. You need to make the decision\nto buy it yourself, everybody has their\nown sense of style, so a woman who\nworks on the make-up counter might\nbe a fake-tan fiend and give you a far\nmore \u2018bronzed\u2019 look than what you\nwant, or what you would normally go\nfor.\nAlso, this may sound obvious but,\ndon\u2019t put your regular foundation on\nbefore you try to buy a new one; go\nshopping with minimal make-up on,\nso that you can really tell the difference between no make-up and the potential new foundation.\nAnother good tip for when people\nare doing your make-up for you, is to\nget them to do half your face at a time,\nas in do the left side then the right, so\nthat you can look in the mirror half\nway through and see the effects of the\nfoundation.\nAlthough this can be fairly time\nconsuming, and after you\u2019ve had your\nmake-up applied you feel compelled\nto buy the product, don\u2019t! You don\u2019t\nneed to buy the first foundation you\ntry. If you\u2019re rushed for time and you\nSpring is here! Now is the perfect time\nto unearth the latest makeup trends!\nThe catwalks had many of their models parading down with a fresh pretty\nlook. Hair was worn soft and wavy to\ncomplete the young milkmaid vibe.\nBeautiful skin is essential to achieve this\nlook. It needs to be dewy and natural,\nand a tinted moisturiser is the perfect\nway to achieve this barely covered look.\nLips for day should be pink; any variation of the shade will work from a soft\nrose to a pinky coral. For a bargain buy,\ngo for Rimmel as they always follow the\nlatest trend.\nFor the evening, lips should make a\nstatement. Deep glossy plums are bang\nwant to try a couple of foundations,\ntry it out on the inside of your wrist,\nand see if you can cover up the veins.\nThis of course, won\u2019t give you much\nof an indication of how it will feel on\nyour skin, but you can at least get the\ncolour right. The inside of your wrist\nmatches your facial skin tone much\nbetter than the back of your hand, so\ndon\u2019t be tempted to try it out on the\nback of your hand.\nHow do you decide which one is\nright for you? You can choose from\nliquid foundations, mousses, compacts or tinted moisturisers, so which\nis better?\nTo start with, you need to think about\nyour own skin type; normal skin types\ncan use pretty much anything, but if\nyou have dry skin, you need to look at\nmoisturising foundations, which usually come in liquid form. Also, dry skin\ntypes should avoid powders and powder finishes as these can make your\nskin look flakey and even drier. On\nthe other hand if you have greasy skin,\nand are prone to breakouts, you should\navoid oil-based liquid foundations.\nOK, so now you\u2019ve chosen the correct foundation, how do you apply it?\nMake sure that your skin is clean and\nyour moisturiser has had a chance to\nsoak in properly before you apply your\nfoundation, otherwise it\u2019ll slide off\nfairly quickly. Spot little blobs of foundation on each cheek, your forehead\nand your chin, and then smooth these\nblobs together using either a make-up\nsponge or foundation brush. When\nyou smooth them together, make sure\nyou use downwards strokes with the\nbrush or the sponge. We do have tiny\nhairs on our faces, and you need to\nbrush in the direction of the hairs, ie.\ndownwards, to keep them pushed flat\nagainst your skin.\non trend here.\nEyes should have a sheer wash of vibrant colour across the lids; invest in a\ngood brush to ensure that the colour is\napplied evenly and that the beautiful\nsheer look is applied to perfection.

    "content": "14 felix FRIDAY 19 MARCH 2010\nMUSIC\nMusic Editors:\nMusic Editors: Alexandra Ashford, Kadhim Shubber & Luke Turner\nAlexandra Ashford, Kadhim Shubber & Luke Turner\nOnline Editor: Christopher Walmsley\nOnline Editor: Christopher Walmsley\nmusic.felix@gmail.com www.felixmusic.tk\nStellar Sweet Symphony\nT\nhe concert began with\nan ICU Dance Company\nand ICSO (IC Symphony\nOrchestra) collaboration\nfor a Mexican Huapango\nwhich, probably due to my lack of experience in the art of dance, made me\ncringe slightly. The dancing was not as\nwell synchronised as the music was,\nbut the orchestra\u2019s high-point of the\nconcert was yet to come.\nBeethoven\u2019s Piano Concerto No.2\nfollowed, which the orchestra opened\nwith elegance and poise, taking its\ngood time with the sweeping harmo-nies. The music was commanding,\nalthough stronger dynamic contrast\nmight have helped to build more mo-mentum. Nevertheless, this allowed\nthe orchestra to fluidly introduce the\npiano.\nThe attention to detail and accuracy\nof the pianist, Shuang Huang, during\nthe technically demanding scalic passages must be commended, for she\nmade it look and sound enviously ef-fortless, which it surely was not. Evidently, she did not lack the technical\nability to tackle such a concerto, and\nher performance was thorough and\nloyal. The phrases in the music were\nwonderfully ornamented, although\nmore assertive dynamics would have\ngiven more shape to the phrases, and\nwould have done more to convince.\nPerhaps it was the numerous fast passages that caused a loss in depth of\nsound in other parts, namely the second movement. The orchestra continued to accompany stylishly, which\nthreatened to make the piano sound\nflat; but again, the flowing scalic piano\npassages were impressively executed\nand marked the performance as a show\nof great technical ability on Huang\u2019s\npart.\nAfter the interval, came the headliner of the concert: Holst\u2019s The Planets.\nThere is no way that a piece of music\nwhich spans the astrological solar system can be thoroughly reviewed in an\narticle of such a small size. The epic\nmood of The Planets was done justice\nby the ISCO, who had obviously prepared hard for this suite. Their efforts\nwere compensated with a performance\nwhich oozed confidence: the impressively seismic as demanded from the\nmusic had the audience gripped to\ntheir seats and almost breathless.\nHolst created this music for a large\norchestra featuring harps, timpanis\nand a celesta (which looks like a tall\npiano but sounds like a glockenspiel),\namongst the usual string, woodwind,\nbrass and percussion instruments. The\nmyriad of sounds were all seamlessly\nbrought together by the conductor, Richard Dickens, and it was truly a feast\nfor the senses. The inspirational sense\nof team-work amongst the musicians\ncould clearly be felt; and it was heartwarming to see a full-house of proud\nfamilies and friends in the audience,\nsome of whom were forced to sit on\nthe steps.\nEach movement transported everyone swiftly from one planet to an-other, in such a colourful and dynamic\nfashion that it felt almost like a test on\nthe stamina of the audience, let alone\nthe musicians and the conductor. The\njourney through astrology culminated\nat Neptune, at the end of which the\nhuman voice of a women\u2019s chorus ap-peared. The chorus was beautifully and\nauthentically integrated into the orchestral music just as Holst had meant\nit to be. The sopranos of the chamber\nchoir sang from the room adjacent to\nthe stage, and the door was closed as\nthe voices became fainter, eventually\nfading to silence.\nFor someone who has never heard\nThe Planets in their entirety, I was glad\nto have done so for the first time played\nby the ISCO because I was genuinely\nblown away by their talent. I recommend their concerts to everyone, even\nand especially someone unfamiliar\nwith the music. It is a great opportunity to become impressed and inspired\nby our colleagues in a context that we\nmight never have seen or imagined\nbefore.\nOf the two support bands, Canterbury\nwere by far and away the best of the\nbunch. They provided a gig that was\nmiles better than the \u201cHigh School Battle of the Bands\u201d performance given by\ntheir opener, Brigade. The poppy, synth\nladen sound of \u201cPeace & Quiet\u201d along\nwith the beautifully harmonious vocals\nof the two singers made sure I couldn\u2019t\nstop tapping my feet. As Canterbury\nenergetically jumped around the stage\nfor their last song, I thought that Twin\nAtlantic would have a hard time bettering their support\u2019s performance.\nBefore the headliners even made it\nonto the stage, an intense feedback\nrose, resembling a war-cry from William Wallace\u2019s army. This noise grew\nand grew, creating an almost unbearably tense atmosphere. Suddenly the\nfeedback was killed, and the opening\nriff of Twin Atlantic\u2019s \u201cYou\u2019re Turning Into John Wayne\u201d drew whooping\nand cheers of satisfaction from a very\nexcited crowd. Three songs in and \u201cHuman After All\u201d ensured that the crowd\nfilling the room jumped up and down\nthe Twin Atlantic\nBrixton Academy\n3rd March\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2729\nIC Symphony Orchestra spaces Joanna Cai out with a fantastic\nperformance of Holst\u2019s The Planets\nOne day a Hot Chip obsession existed.\nIt faded and an album was released.\nIt faded more and another album was\nreleased. A bit after that they played\nBrixton and I re-acknowledged their\nexistence. Although, this was deeply\nunappreciated because I hadn\u2019t heard\nhalf the songs.\nHowever, one of the things that truly\nis appreciable is the difference between\nthe live and studio recorded material.\nWhilst the beats from the stereo can\nhardly be blasted, and the majority of\ntheir songs either make you want to\nstare into space and imagine brightly\ncoloured dots or, let\u2019s just admit it, are\njust plain emo; they managed to enliven\nevery song into a fresh, new, and most\nimportantly danceable interpretation.\nDespite my disgusting ignorance, it\nwas clear to see that every other devoted fan there was enjoying their triumphant homecoming set as their sweetly\nsounding electro pop created raucous\nwaves of bodies in the crowd and spectators that refused to sit down in the\nbalcony. Oh how naughty.- Lily Le\nlike a colony of ants on a bass sub. The\naudience\u2019s reaction to Twin Atlantic\nwas imense and resulted in the only\ncase I\u2019ve seen of both crowd and band\npleading for an encore. The majority\nof the last song was performed after\nthe venue was permitted to play live\nmusic and this just added to the punk\nfeel of the gig, sending members of the\ncrowd wild as they careered into one\nand other. After the last of the feedback\nhad died off and I began to hear more\nthan a faint ringing in my ears, I had no\ndoubts that Twin Atlantic deserved this\nheadline appearance and I think they\nmay have had fun performing too!\n- Andy Roast\nTwin Fantastic\nHot Chip\nBrixton Academy\n26th February\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2729\u2729\nThey only want to be your\none life stand...\nOoh... pretty space things.

    "content": "4 felix FRIDAY 19 MARCH 2010\nnews.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nNEWS\nT\nhe last few days of this\nyear\u2019s Sabbatical Elections\nwere manic as ever as results were announced this\npast Monday evening in\nda Vinci\u2019s bar. The intense two week\nelection period saw Alex Kendall win\nthe position of Union President whilst\nHeather Jones fought off her four competitors to become next year\u2019s Deputy\nPresident (Clubs & Societies). Victoria\nMasding and Ravi Pall won their duels\nfor their positions for next year\u2019s Deputy President (Welfare) and Deputy\nPresident (Finance & Services) respec-tively, whilst Meera Ganeshadevan\nmanaged to stave off the threat of RON\n(Re-open Nominations) to become\nDeputy President (Education). There\nwas no shock result for Felix Editor as\nKadhim Shubber acquired the vast majority of votes cast.\nAfter voting closed on Saturday\nnight, the final candidates\u2019 meeting\nsaw the impending threat of delays to\nthe final announcements as Presidential candidates initially refused to sign\noff statements demonstrating their\nsatisfaction with the election process.\nAlthough the pressure of campaigning was alleviated, the suspense of\nawaiting results caused tension that\nsurfaced during the day on Monday. It\nwas understood that the new Deputy\nPresidents, Felix Editor and Student\nTrustees would be announced that\nevening without the results of the\nPresidential election.\nThree out of four of the Presidential\ncandidates looked to lodge complaints\nwith Returning Officers Daniel Hill\nand John James, who were responsible for administering 2010\u2019s elections.\nThe rules state that results cannot be\nannounced until all official complaints\nare resolved. By this stage in proceed-ings, the new President of the Union\nwas said to be announced at earliest on\nFriday 19th March.\nAfter the Presidential candidates\nwere called to a separate meeting, all\nthree candidates eventually withdrew\ntheir complaints and by approximately\n4pm, results for the full set of sabbaticals were due to go ahead together that\nevening.\nThe initial threat of at least a three\nday delay to Presidential election results came to light as Stanislav Tarasov\nbelieved he had been \u201ctreated unfairly\u201d\nby the Elections committee after forgetting to submit his manifesto and\nphoto to the Union to put up on voting\nwebsite. After noticing several days after the given deadline for submissions,\nFRESH FACES\nAT THE UNION\nDAN WAN REPORTS ON THE FINAL DAYS\nOF THE SABBATICAL ELECTIONS 2010 AS\nTHE NEW TEAM IS ANNOUNCED THIS\nWEEK\nSabbatical\n2010\nfelix coverage\nthe Returning Officers denied requests\nfor a late upload of the manifesto and\npicture. Subsequently, Tarasov looked\nto take the matter to Union Court,\nImperial College\u2019s Union highest committee that also has responsibility for\noverseeing the annual elections with\nfairness and integrity. In an event of a\nformal complaint straight to the Union\nCourt, the Court would have met on\nthe Thursday evening meaning results\ncould not have been announced until\nat least Friday morning.\nTarasov himself is adamant he wishes to be heard even though he dropped\nhis final complaint.\n\u201cWhile I have no one to blame other\nthan myself, after my request to place\nit online was denied on Tuesday, it\nwas pointed out to me that, unlike\nother candidates who submitted it\nwithin 12h after the deadline and were\nmarked late, mine was 4 days late. I\npersonally don\u2019t recall the 12 hour time\ninterval being specified anywhere, in\nconstitution at least. So, in the context\nof things, 12 hours and 4 days are the\nsame thing.\u201d\nThe Union had received another\ncomplaint from a Presidential candidate about the perceived illegal printing of flyers by a Presidential rival.\nIt was claimed he had produced too\nmany A6 flyers that could be accounted for under the official election budgets set for each candidate.\nFellow potential Presidential Alex\nKendall\u2019s grievance was less significant in comparison after he was fined\n\u00a320 for breaking the election\u2019s pedantic rulings. His campaign poster was\nfound by Returning Officer John James\nin clear sight of a voting terminal (i.e. a\ncomputer).\nTarasov and Kendall\u2019s complaints\nwere quickly withdrawn on Monday,\nbut the third complaint took some deliberation from the candidate whether\nor not to follow suit and withdraw it.\nEventually it was through, and so ten\nminutes before da Vinci\u2019s bar entertained a full crowd to Imperial\u2019s match\nRavi Pall\nDeputy President\n(Finance & Services) 2010/11\nWho would your dream Summer\nBall headliner be?\nErol Alkan, he is undisputably the\ngod of electro. He\u2019s sure to appeal\nto a lot of outgoing students but to\ncover all grounds, possibly MGMT or\nsomething.\nHeather Jones\nDeputy President\n(Clubs & Societies) 2010/11\nWhat super-society would you\nmake out of existing societies?\nI would never actually do this, but\ncombining the food societies to\nFeast Soc would be pretty amazing.\nFulfilling Imperial\u2019s feasting needs\nsounds epic!\nVicki Masding\nDeputy President\n(Welfare) 2010/11\nHow do you feel about sharing an\noffice with Meera?\nIt\u2019ll be great. She\u2019s so small I\u2019ll have\nmost of the space anyway. She\u2019ll be\nmy paperweight for all the documents\nthat\u2019ll be piling up on my desk.\nMeera Ganeshadevan\nDeputy President\n(Education) 2010/11\nIfyouhadn\u2019tbeenelected,what\nwouldyoubedoing?\nIf I hadn\u2019t been elected I would\nprobably have tried to get a job for a\nfew months and then gone travelling\nto South America.... those plans are\nnow currently on hold.\nKadhim Shubber\nFelix Editor 2010/11\nIfyoucouldfeatureanyone,literally\nanyone,asacentrefoldnextyear,\nwhowoulditbe?\nDan Wan, but he\u2019d have to be\ncompletely nude, balls and\neverything , right outside the Queen\u2019s\nTower.\n\u201cI\u2019m glad I now get\nthe chance to show\nI meant what I said\nin campaigning.\u201d\nAlex Kendall, President-elect\n\n"

With the\nMedicals down to 13 players for the\nremainder of the game, it seemed like\nthe opportune moment for College to\nget some points on the board, starting\nwith the penalty in front of the posts.\nWith two men extra on the pitch,\nit was expected that College would\ntake advantage by running at the un-dermanned back line of the Medicals,\nhowever, some superb defending by\nSharples stopped one such attack.\nPoor decision-making crept in again,\nwith College deciding to kick the ball\ntime and time again to the deadly\nMedicals fullback Nzekwue, who simply glided through the ragged defence.\nTo add insult to injury, it was the Medicals who managed to score again with\nFisher-Black scoring in the corner that\neffectively finished the game at 29-13\nto the Medicals.\nPoor decision-making was the\ndownfall of the College side, which\nJPR Williams attributed to their age\nand relative inexperience compared\nto the Medicals. Nevertheless, it was\na thoroughly entertaining match, with\nJPR Williams commenting that it had\n\u201cmore flair and excitement than some\nof the Six Nation games this year\u201d.\nMake sure you\u2019re here next year!\nMEDICALS 29 - 13 COLLEGE\nJPR WILLIAMS CUP 2010\nTRIES\nJ.

Johnstone\nThe winning Medicals side, JPR Williams Cup winners 2010\nAmerican football\nend inaugural season\nGeoffrey Chow American Football\nIt\u2019s been a tough first season in the\nBUAFL for the Imperial Immortals.\nPlaying vastly more experienced opponents with larger squads to choose\nfrom has meant the team has gone into\nmost games as underdogs. However\nin a season that has seen them steadily improve it was perhaps fitting that\nthey saved their best performance for\nlast.\nPlaying on a Wednesday afternoon\nafter the fixture had been rained off the\nprevious Sunday, the Immortals headed down the A3 to Guildford to take\non a Surrey team still in the hunt for\na place in the Challenge Trophy. The\nSurrey Stingers needed to outscore the\nImmortals by 68 points to extend their\nrun into the post-season and their belief that they could achieve such a high\nscore no doubt spurred on the Imperial team.\nThe game started rather patchily for\nthe Immortals with the defence unable\nto stop Surrey adding two scores, to go\nin at the half 12-0 down.\nThe second half saw the Immortals\ncome out firingThe defence stepped\nup with the defensive line of Azu OsaAfiana, Quirin Grossmann and Maciej\nKurek snuffing out the Stingers inside\nrunning game and the defensive secondary led by an inspired Thomas\nRhoades keeping the pass game in\ncheck.\nScoring has been a weakness for\nthe Immortals this season, but late in\nthe 4th quarter, Edward Fisher, playing his last league game for the club,\nmade sure his team got some points\non the board. A 48 yard touchdown\nrun followed by a 2 point conversion\nby Tino Millar, put the score at 8-18\nand bought the Immortals to within 10\npoints of the Stingers, just as the clock\nran down ending the game.\nSo the Immortals ended the season\nwith a closely contested match and\nhave every reason to look forward to\nnext year. A lot of lessons have been\nlearnt and valuable experience gained\nand with the majority of the squad set\nto return, the Immortals have an excellent chance to be a competitive team.\nOne thing is for sure, the Immortals\ntook everything that their opponents\ncould throw at them this year and will\nreturn stronger, wiser and ready for the\nfight next season.\nImperial Immortals 8\nSurrey Stingers 18\nAthletics sweep ULU Champs Football 4s clinch ULU league\nIn their quest for the much coveted Division 1 title, ICUAFC 4th\nXI, IC Football\u2019s flagship Wednesday\nULU team, faced a mere ninety minutes more, finishing the season with\na tricky tie against Queen Mary\u2019s 3rd\nXI. QM had comfortably ejected the\n4s from the cup earlier this season,\nthough were on the receiving end of a\nmasterclass in champagne football in\nthe reverse league fixture and a win in\nthis game would guarantee the title for\nImperial.\nThe core squad was depleted by the\nabsence of long term injury victims\nMarcus and Raam, as well as recent\nMarc-Viven Fo\u00e9 impersonator Lobb.\nThe deadlock was broken midway\nthrough the first half by Ahmad, whose\nfree kick hung like a London fashion\ndesigner before finding the back of the\nnet. IC came close to doubling their\nlead when a near post corner was too\nmuch for the \u2018keeper to handle and\nthe ball fell to either John or Edward,\nwhichever is more annoying, inside the\n6-yard box. However, he shanked his\nshot wide of the post.\nThe 4s were made to pay for their\nprofligacy in front of goal as QM\nequalised just before half time. A free\nkick was swung over from the right and\nMax,lost his mark-ee. allowing him to\nDamian Phelan Football volley in at the far post.\nA stirring half time team talk from\nMarcus Megson left the team in no\ndoubt what needed to be done, and the\nfront four began to show the necessary heart, attacking with both speed\nand guile. Josh powered a header just\nover the bar after great trickery from\nAhmad on the left, before contriving to\nmiss an open goal, despite having more\ntime to think than Jon Venables.\nJosh redeemed himself soon after by\nwinning the ball in midfield and splitting the defence with a well weighted\nthrough ball to Tom. The striker continued his rich vein of scoring form to\nfinish across the face of the \u2018keeper and\nput IC ahead. Another mazy run from\nRich (exponent of the world\u2019s worst\nthrow-in) ended in him going down in\nthe box easier than John Terry on his\nbest mate\u2019s missus. Rich dusted himself off and lashed an unstoppable penalty low to the \u2018keeper\u2019s right.\nIC were able to ward off any further\nthreat with ease, and rapturous scenes\ngreeted the final whistle as it was confirmed Marcus had led his team to\nthe first IC Football league win in recent memory. The team captain led\nthe celebrations with champagne and\nrumbuccas in the Union and manager\nbashing in the Rocket. A fantastic season had been capped with an excellent\nwin and credit must go to everyone\nwho has played a part in such a successful campaign.\nFor the very first time the University of London Athletics Championships were held\nindoors, at the fantastic Lee Valley Athletics\nCentre.

    "content": "Nothing on? See Noises Off\nShamini Bundell has and is still giggling from the experience\n13\nfelix FRIDAY 19 MARCH 2010\nARTS\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nI\nn days gone past, the front row\nwas the place to be \u2013 the most\nexpensive and exclusive tick-ets, the tickets that showed you\nhad power and position in the\nworld. In short, theatre-seating hier-achy was simple. The closer you were\nto the front, the more important you\nwere. I guess this has something to do\nwith being closest to the stage (and\nsupposedly having the best view) as\nwell as being closest to the stars.\nSo what has changed? Most front\nrows are now taken up by loudmouth\nteenagers with no theatre dress sense\n(I once saw a girl wearing a t-shirt and\nnot much else). I think this progression is twofold (or maybe three if I can\nthink straight!) and its results also give\nthe appearance of ouroboros: that of\na snake biting its tail \u2013 or in theatre\nterms, well we'll get to that later.\nOver the years, set designs have become vaster if not more imaginative. In\nthe sixties and seventies we saw some\nof the most amazing designs such as\nthe set of Grind that completely rotated\nbetween scenes to show the inside and\noutside of a club. A pioneer of outlandish set design was Eugene Lee, one of\nmy favourite set designers if only for\nthe way his sets perfectly set the atmosphere of a play. Among his crazy ideas\nwas a production of Candide in which\nthe Broadway Theatre was broken up\ninto small stages connected by walkways\nand seats ripped out in favour of wooden\nbenches and stools. This closed pretty\nsoon after opening. His other attempt at\ncompletely demolishing the Broadway\nwas Dude! by Ragni and Rado. The stage\nand seats were separated into different\nareas such as forest and sky with each\narea also representing a different price\nrange (Producers know how to make\ntheatregoers pay more without them\nrealising), as the floor was strewn with\nfeathers and soil. Needless to say this\nclosed even quicker than Candide.\nBut sets continued to grew, especially through the 80s when the recession\nmeant people wanted more for their\nmoney and so wanted huge extravaganzas with sets to match. Into the 90s\nand to the present day we have looked\nat huge automated sets that look pret-ty, change within the blink of an eyelid,\nand have the potential to decapitate a\npoor unsuspecting ensemble member\nwith one blow. So what does this sort\nof set mean for sightlines, especially\nfor the front row elite?\nFor the cheap seats, things get bet-ter; big sets mean you can see more\nof it from further away and there tend\nto be larger ensembles hence more to\nsee if you sit further back. For the first\nclass front rowers, things get worse. A\nlarge set means more will be played\nupstage meaning you can't see jack\nall. The stage will be further above the\nseats to accomodate all the mcgubbins\ncontrolling your swanky automated\nset and the larger ensemble will mean\nmore feet for you to stare at! Two\nfriends of mine recently found themselves in the front row of Hairspray\nwhere the view was so bad they had to\nmove back a few rows just to see any\nof the show. In short, only foot fetishists and those who like peering into\nthe orchestra pit would ever pay full\nprice for these seats.\nAnother reason for the decline in\npopularity can be traced back to Rent.\nIn an attempt to be hip and \"down\nwiv da kids\", and also in an attempt to\nhonour Jonathan Larson, Rent implemented the first lottery ticket system.\nPeople would line up at crazy o'clock\nin the morning to obtain $25 tickets\nfor the front two rows of the theatre.\nThis idea became a phenonemon with\nRentheads camping out multiple times\na week and even creating their own little universe within these lines. Other\nshows started taking this idea for\nthemselves until almost all musicals\non Broadway had some sort of lottery\nor student rush. Now London is starting to catch on with cheap front row\nseats that tend to be full of screaming\nteenagers, or worse screaming drama\nstudents. My point about lottery seats\nOuroboros, or snake eats tail. WTF?\nLucy Harrold takes a look at the history of front row seats from posh snobs to screamy teenagers and beyond\nis that now the front row is notorious\nfor being where the desperate fans\nsit (even if they don't realise they are\nnow possibly the worst seats to have).\nPerhaps another reason why we don't\nwant to sit in the front row anymore is\nto escape the grasps of crazy fan girls.\nAnd finally to the ouroboros moment\n\u2013 audience interaction. I guess Hair\nstarted this back in the 60s, when front\nseats were still the place to be and hoity-toity types were stunned when a hippy\nsuddenly jumped onto their chair or\ngave them a flower. As time has carried\non, interaction has continued and those\nwho do not wish for a negative interaction have distanced themselves from the\nfront. Blue Man Group tend to sell off\ntheir front seats cheap and I think they\nalso provide disclaimers as many of their\nstunts can \"leak\" out to the front row.\nIn Denzel Washington's Julius Caesar,\nthe production was so bloody that the\nfront row were provided with pacamacs\nto protect themselves from flying blood.\nAs negative effects like this increase, the\nvalue of front row seats decreases (unless\nyou're in for a cheap thrill).\nBut we have now come full cir-cle. The new production of Hair has\nbrought back the thrill of being in the\nfront row. People are now willing to\npay as much money as they can to have\nWill Swenson sit on their lap or Gavin\nCreel molest them. (I would.)\nI blame these people, it\u2019s their fault.\nW\nhen it comes to a\nplay within a play,\nDramSoc\u2019s latest\nproduction takes\nfull advantage of\nthe confusion. Although I set out with\nthe noble aim of relating to you the\nwitty intricacies of the plot of Noises\nOff, at the time I was too busy wiping\naway tears of laughter to work out exactly what was going on.\nNoises Off is Michael Frayn\u2019s smash\nhit comedy about a bunch of actors attempting to put on the not-so-smash-hit farce \u2018Nothing On\u2019. DramSoc have\njoyfully embraced the shabby setting\nof the Union Concert Hall as well as\ntheir own extensive experience with\nwobbly and suspiciously familiar sets.\nAided by some impeccable acting\ntalent, director Fran Buckland has\ncrafted a beautiful piece of visual theatre that is one of DramSoc\u2019s most professional productions for some time.\nNewcomer Nigel Fullerton keeps the\naudience in fits of laughter, often without saying a word, while Gilead Amit\u2019s\ngod-like voice is all we need to find\nourselves empathising with the long-suffering director. The whole cast\ndisplays a wonderful comic flair that\nbarely allows the audience to catch\ntheir breath.\nWatching the dress rehearsal last\nTuesday was a thoroughly surreal experience as characters discussed their\nimminent opening night, real and fake\ntechies wandered around fixing things,\nand copious amounts of sardines were\nflung around the stage. I\u2019m pretty sure\nthe sardines were supposed to be there\n(they may in fact have been integral to\nthe plot) but it was usually impossible\nto tell whether the strings of hilarious\nscrew-ups were really in the script or\nnot.\nThe play gets off to a slow start and\nthere is some initially quite confusing\nmime in the second act but it doesn\u2019t\ntake long for the pace to pick up and\nthe gags to start piling up. Solid performances from the whole cast carry\nus through as each act grows into a crescendo of farcical events. Tom Veitch\nfor example embodies a consistent\nand utterly believable helplessness in\nhis character, while Simon Worthington gives the endearing impression of\nhaving just accidentally wandered onto\nthe set.\nHaving watched the dress rehearsal\nI am not entirely sure where DramSoc\nends and the cast and crew of \u2018Nothing On\u2019 begins. Director Fran sat in\nfront of me watching the dress with\nher head in her hands at times while in\nfront of her the \u2018Nothing On\u2019 director\nsat despairing. I\u2019m informed that set\ndesigner John Winters didn\u2019t sleep for\ndays in order to create the ridiculously\nambitious set which is essentially what\nhappens in the play. In fact I\u2019m pretty\nsure Nigel smashed the fourth wall in\nwith his foot at one point while falling\ndown some stairs.\nFor a taste of what to expect from\nNoises Off you could try checking out\nthe photos that accompany this re-view, that is if there are any \u2013 at several\npoints I saw the photographer unable\nto hold his camera steady due to being collapsed against the stage giggling\n\u2013 but for some good laughter therapy\nyou\u2019re probably better off going along\nand watching it for yourself.\nNoises Off continues\ntonight and concludes\ntomorrow evening.\nIf you fancy going in a big\ngroup, DramSoc have a\nspecial deal for you! Bring\n20 people along and you can\nget 20% off the ticket pricethat\u2019s a bargainalicious \u00a34!\nJust as good as the West\nEnd but a tenth of the price!\n\n"

They go into league tables and everything.\nWhat\u2019s more, College actually listen to the views sourced from it.\nLast year, College set up a committee specifically to address issues\nfound in the NSS. It met regularly and encouraged each department\nto write an \u2018action plan\u2019 based on where they did badly.\nGo to thestudentsurvey.com to complete the survey. It takes\nabout 10 minutes and it\u2019s mainly multiple choice.\nIf you\u2019re still not convinced it\u2019s important, we\u2019ve donated eight\nprizes you could win if you fill it in. Up for grabs are:\n4 x Life Membership to Imperial College Union (usually costs \u00a398!)\n4 x Entertainments tickets to the Summer Ball 2010, which needs\nno introduction.\nhigher than other Departments in College. Their votes were a major\nreason why the Faculty of Natural Sciences emerged victorious to\nbeat the other faculties\u2019 voting turnout percentages:\nFaculty of Engineering = 22.9% turnout\nFaculty of Medicine = 18.1% turnout\nFaculty of Natural Sciences = 29.4% turnout\nWin prizes!Win prizes!\nTake the NSS, head to: thestudentsurvey.com\nJonathan Silver\nDeputy President (Education)\ndpeducation@imperial.ac.uk\nThanks for\nvoting all you\nlovely people!\n\n"

However, Varsity\nseems to be one of those games where\nprevious performance counts for nothing on the night.\nThe first half was, by all accounts,\nCollege\u2019s half, playing some sublime\nrugby and constantly threatening the\nMedicals try line. In a stark contrast\nto previous years, it was the College\nforwards that were dominating the\nscrums, with some excellent work by\nO\u2019Rourke as well as Louwagie and\nCoggrave on their Varsity debut. The\nsustained pressure from the College\nforwards saw them ebb ever nearer to\nthe Medicals try line, eventually earning a penalty in a kickable position,\nhowever, kicker Newton was unable to\nconvert leaving the score 0-0.\nThis sustained pressure carried on\nfor the rest of the half, yet College\nnever seemed able break the game line\nand put the Medicals on the back foot.\nDespite this pressure, the Medicals\nwere the first to score after a fortunate\nSame old\nMedics,\nalways\nwinning!\n19.03.10\nBUCS\nChampionship\nsuccess >>\npages 32-33\nbounce saw scrum half Manyard unleash Sharples on the wing who comfortably ran in the try to give the Medicals a 5-0. Fly-Half Neville was unable\nto score the conversion.\nAfter the restart, the College side\nwere determined to get some points\non the board with the forwards increasing the pressure on the Medicals,\neventually earning another penalty\nin front of the posts on the 22m line.\nAn out of form Newton managed to\nstrike the upright with the kick, but\nwas able to recover the ball, giving the\npossession back to College. After a few\nmore phases, College managed to set\nup a rolling maul in the Medicals 22,\nwhich they managed to push over the\nline giving a well earned try to the College forwards. Newton converted the\nkick to give College a 7-5 lead. A penalty a piece, before the end of the half\nsaw the score-line at 10-8 to College,\nwho were definitely looking the most\nthreatening.\nThe second half saw a renewed and\nregenerated Medicals side take it to the\nCollege backs. Despite the best efforts\nof scrum half Freddie Chalke, who JPR\nWilliams gave a noteworthy mention\nafter the game, the College backs never\nseemed able to threaten the Medicals,\nsomething which they would regret\nlater in the game.\nPoor kicking and decision making by\nthe College backs eventually led to the\nMedicals first try of the second half,\nwith Neville again unleashing Sharples on the wing after College\u2019s fullback,\nJoachim, was turned over in his 22. A\nsuccessful conversion by Neville gave\nthe Medicals a 15-10 lead early in the\nsecond half. The Medical backs were\nattacking the line with such a high\nintensity that it was only a matter of\ntime before they would break the line\nagain, and it was the Medicals centre\nwho all but put the game to rest after\nhe crossed the line to give them a 22-10 lead.\nDespite the upper hand that the\nMedicals had, the College side were\ndetermined to get another try and had\nan extensive period of pressure in the\nMedicals half, which saw penalty after\npenalty being given against the Medicals. With 10 minutes to go, controversy struck after two Medical players\nwere sin-binned, one for repeatedly\nkilling the ball and the second to Ben\nDavies for a dangerous tackle on the\n\u201cMore flair and\nexcitement than\nsome of the Six\nNations games this\nyear\u201d\nPhotography by Ian Gillet\n\n"

    "content": "3\nfelix FRIDAY 19 MARCH 2010\nNEWS\nnews.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nT\nhe smoking debate had to\nreach the Union in some\nsort of manner at some\npoint. It turns out it happened in the form of a\npaper presented at Council this past\nMonday. The paper came by way of\nthe Representation and Welfare Board\nmeeting where it was proposed by John\nJames, the Deputy President of Welfare. Council mostly whizzed through\nthe Sabbatical reports with its usual\nrubber stamping before discussing the\n\u201cSmoke-free campus\u201d paper.\nAccording to minutes from an RWB\nmeeting, available publicly on the Union website, the constituents of this\nbody voted to accept one of the resolves of the original paper, which was\nto \u201clobby college to implement a smoke\nfree campus\u201d. RWB suggested that this\nshould take the form of a referendum,\nshould Council agree to it. The referendum was to propose a \u201cDo you want\na smoke free campus?\u201d question.\nFrom the get-go, questions and observations started pouring in from ordinary council members and observers\npresent.\nMark Flowers, who has been involved\nin the Union for many years and has\nUnion consider smoking ban on campus\npreviously been described as \u201cpossibly\nthe only person (...) seen time and time\nagain doing immeasurable good for the\nUnion\u201d\n, criticised the call for a referendum through Council by pointing out\nthat never has a referendum been called\nthrough this committee, rather than by\namassing the necessary signatures from\nthe student population.\nKadhim Shubber, Felix Editor elect,\npointed out that referendums should\nnot be a tool to gauge opinion or sentiment of the student body, but rather a\ndevice for decisive action. Mr Shubber\nsuggested instead that a survey be carried out, and that the sabbatical team\nfind the time to carry out this survey\non the ground as well as online in an\neffort to truly engage with and feel the\nbeat of the student body. Many other\npeople seemed to echo his views that a\nreferendum is perhaps the wrong way\nto go about starting to deal with the issue at hand in a formal manner.\nIt was also pointed out that the there\nwas no research done by the proposers\nregarding implementation of a potential ban on smoking, including necessary patrolling and staffing. Danny\nHill, Deputy President of Finance and\nServices raised the issue that stopping\nthe sale of tobacco in Union outlets\n(including the Shop and Newsagent)\ncould be commercially detrimental to\nits bottom line figure. Other issues\nthat were raised were the impossibility of moving all smoking\nto the streets outside the Union\nbuilding because of possible neighbour\ncomplaints that could affect the late licenses held.\nThe debate was somewhat heated\nand almost completely unmoderated\nby the Council Chair, which meant that\na conversation was going on between\nthose present. Rebecca Coxhead, who\nis the Clerk to Council, had to intervene and ask members to be quiet and\nstop talking over one another.\nThe evening was not complete without a procedural motion that proposes\nthat there is a move to a vote. While\nthis motion was seconded, it was overruled by the Council Chair. Of note is\nthe fact that several people who were\nseemingly against, and rather quite vocal about this paper, namely the Equal\nOpportunities Officer Chris Darby, the\nCGCU Welfare Officer Alice Rowlands\nand International Officer Matthew\nFitch, actually all sit on the RWB, the\nbody that brought the paper to council.\nAlice Rowlands (foreground) looks to question John James (background in black) who brought the paper to Council\nDurham has enough with the NUS and follows Imperial by withdrawing\nLast Friday Durham University Students\u2019 Union announced the results of\ntheir recent referendum on continuing\nthe Union\u2019s affiliation to the National\nUnion of Students. Only 1217 students\nvoted yes, compared with 1295 who\nvoted no to staying in the NUS. This\nmeans that Durham will be following\nImperial College\u2019s lead. Imperial left in\n2008 after a similar referendum produced a resounding 70 per cent for the\n\u2018No to continued affiliation\u2019 campaign.\nDurham\u2019s \u2018No\u2019 campaign used the\nexperience of Unions such as Imperial\u2019s to strengthen their case, \u201ca\nnumber of other unions have disaf-filiated and see it as a benefit, not a\nproblem. Students are still able to get\ndiscounts, their bars are competitive,\nand they are still able to campaign on\nissues which are important to their\nstudents.\u201d\nLike Imperial, Durham has been\nin and out of NUS membership in\nrecent years because of inconsistent\nvoting in multiple referenda. For ex-ample, as late as November 2009 the\nlast vote revealed 80 per cent support for continued membership. According to Durham\u2019s Union, \u201crecent\nevents, especially by the NUS Black\nStudents Officer and the LGBT Officer, have caused enough students in\nDSU to come forward to sign a secure\npetition to create another referendum\nabout this issue.\u201d That comment refers\nSina Ataherian\nSina Ataherian\nto a shocking letter sent by the NUS\nin response to the Durham\u2019s invitation\nof a British National Party politician\nto a debate on multiculturalism. The\nfull text of the letter has been posted\non the facebook group of Durham\nUniversity Students for Freedom of\nSpeech.\nThe last part of the letter has caused\nthe greatest offence.\nIt reads, \u201cShould you fail to listen to\nour advice [to cancel the event] you will\nhave a colossal demonstration on your\nhands. The National Union of Students, Unite Against Fascism, and other anti-fascist organisations are already\nmobilising nationally and organising\ncoach loads of students to demonstrate\nat your university on Friday evening.\nThis will no doubt bring with it a lot of\nnegative media attention and if any students are hurt in and around this event\nresponsibility will lie with you.\n\u201cWe would appreciate it if you could\noutline how you will now proceed with\nthis issue and ensure that those students who are under threat from the\nBNP\u2019s racist and homophobic principles will be protected. We await your\nprompt response.\u201d\nDurham students will not be represented by the NUS, following Imperial\u2019s lead in withdrawing membership\nAfonso Campos reports on Union Council\u2019s deliberation upon the implications of a campus-wide smoking ban\nNo smoking a national trend?\nA\nfter smoking was banned in 2007 in all enclosed public and work\nspaces, the issue of smoking on campus is one that many universities began to take heed. Felix research has found that no university in the UK is fully smoke-free at the moment; some institu-tions, Cambridge University being one of them, even allow smoking in some\nresidence halls. In the United States only around 10% of universities are 100%\nsmoke-free. Most top institutions in the US were notably missing from this\nlist, with no Ivy League currently on it.\nA report by pub trade magazine, The Publican, found that\nthere was no increase in the sales of food as was expected after\nthe smoking ban came into effect. Contrastingly, Punch Taverns,\nthe biggest public house conglomerate in the country has claimed\nthe increased variety of customers, including families and happier\nstaff.\nThe Union lies somewhere in between these two, as it is part of a\nuniversity but is also host to a bar running a busy revenue-making\nactivity. The decision of whether or not to become a smoke-free\ncampus must take hints from a myriad of industries and organisations to hopefully come up with a decision that is in touch\nwith the rest of the country.\n21%\nof people smoke regularly\n(twice or more a week)\nin the UK\n24%\nof people smoke regularly\n(twice or more a week)\nat Imperial College\n24%\nof people at Imperial College\nbelieve that College should be\na smoke-free campus\nSurvey was based on 250 people from several strategic locations on the South\nKensington campus on a single day.

The event took place to mark the end of \u2018Libel Week\u2019. Highlights included a poem by comedian Tim\nMinchin about scientific ignorance, a live interview with\nDr Peter Wilmhurst - currently being sued by NMT Medical - and a \u2018sing-a-long-a-Simon-Singh-song\u2019 performed by\nAriane Sherine, the woman behind the \u2018Atheist Buses.\u2019 Proceeds from the tickets went to the Libel Reform Campaign.\nThe approaching dawn\nPreparations for the\nlaunch of Akatsuki,\na Japanese satellite\nbound for Venus, are\nunderway after the\nrelocation of the orbiter to the island of\nTanegashima situated\nto the south-west of\nthe country. Akatsuki, meaning \u2018dawn\u2019, will be launched\nfrom the Tanegashima Space Centre later this spring.\nIt is hoped that the project will help explain why Venus, a\nplanet not dissimilar from our own, turned out to be so in-hospitable. One of the features to be explored is the super-rotation of Venus\u2019 atmosphere which orbits the planet at a\nstaggering 400km per hour. It is also hoped that Akatsuki\nwill be the first satellite to capture images of lightning on\nthe planet thanks to a camera, specially-designed for the\npurpose, being mounted on the orbiter.\nAbsolutely flawless\nThe ability for humans to regrow body\nparts may no longer\nbe confined to the\nrealms of Hollywood.\nThe regrowth ability is\nbelieved to have been\nlost through evolution\nbut may be reactivated\nby removal of the p21\ngene.\nExperiments conducted at the Wistar Institute, Philadelphia, have already seen regrowth of ear tissue in mice in\nsuch a way as would leave no trace of the initial wound. The\nremoval of p21 causes adult cells to behave as stem cells,\nmeaning a temporary disabling of the gene would allow for\nflawless healing and regrowth. However, as p21 is one of the\nbody\u2019s defences against cancer, the side-effects of switching off this gene will need to be investigated further.\nResearchers at the University of California, Davis, have found the Holy\nGrail; they have discovered that beer\nis good for you. The drink is rich in\nnutrients that can help prevent weak\nbones. With almost 7 billion pints of\nbeer drunk in the UK each year, it is a\nrich source of dietary silicon for much\nof the population. The researchers\nhave concluded that silicon can help\ncut the chance of developing diseases\nsuch as osteoporosis.\nThe big question is, which types of\nbeer are better? Luckily for real ale\nlovers, those beers containing malted\nbarley and hops have a higher silicon\ncontent than those made from wheat.\nLight lagers made from grains like\ncorn or rice have the lowest levels.\nThe research, published in the Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture, examined 100 commercial\nbeers and their production methods.\nThe report says that roughly half of\nthe silicon in beer is readily absorbed by the body, making\nit an excellent dietary\nsource of the min-eral. Charles Bamforth, lead author of\nthe study, said: \"Beers\ncontaining high levels of malted barley and\nhops are richest in silicon.\nWheat contains less silicon than barley because it\nis the husk of the barley that\nis rich in this element. While\nmost of the silicon remains in\nthe husk during brewing, significant quantities of silicon nonetheless are extracted into wort and\nmuch of this survives into beer.\"\nDr Claire Bowring, from the National Osteoporosis Society, said:\n\"These findings mirror results from\nprevious studies which concluded\nthat moderate alcohol consumption\ncould be beneficial to bones. However,\nwhile the National Osteoporosis Society welcomes measures to improve\nbone health we do not recommend that\nanyone increases their alcohol consumption on the basis of these studies.\nWhile low quantities of alcohol may\nappear to have bone density benefits,\nhigher intakes have been show to decrease bone strength, with an alcohol\nintake of more than two units per day\nactually increasing the risk of breaking a bone. There are also many other\nhealth concerns linked with alcohol\nwhich cannot be ignored.\"\nCatherine Collins, a dietician at St\nGeorge's Healthcare NHS Trust in\nLondon, said that there is no recommended daily intake of silicon as it is\nhard to prove silicon deficiency due\nto so little being needed. \"Sources of\nsilicon do include beer \u2013 either alco-hol-containing or alcohol-free \u2013 and\nit's also added as an anti-caking agent\nto powders such as baking powder. It\nis found in different\namounts in wa-ter, so contributes to beer's\ntotal silica con-tent. Silica may\nwell contribute\nto bone health\nbut in a minor way. It is\nnot really significant compared with\nnutrients that\nwe know are\nessential for\nbone health\nand are potentially\ndeficient in\nthe UK diet\n\u2013 such as\ncalcium and\nvitamin D.\"\nJames Goldsack\nJames Goldsack\nWhat we\u2019ve been\nwaiting for...\nBig Barry Obama, everyone\u2019s best\nfriend, recently unveiled that he will be\ntrimming the NASA budget, currently\nstanding at $18bn, and allowing only\na tiny increase in its pocket money - a\nmere $1 bn in comparison to the usual\n$3bn needed to continue on its current\npath. This will have disastrous consequences for George W\u2019s dream of returning to the Sea of Tranquillity by\n2020, as well as for the $81bn Constellation Program which was designed to\nreplace the ageing Space Shuttle Program, due to stop operations by the\nend of this year. $9bn has already been\nspent on the program, and NASA still\nhas billions of dollars worth of contractors to pay off.\nThe President now wants to nurture\ncommercial companies to take up the\nmantle of space travel and develop\nrockets able transport astronauts and\nsupplies to the International Space Station, by setting aside $6bn to help start\nup specialist space travel companies\nto do the day-to-day remedial tasks\nof space travel. However, this move by\nObama could leave the USA without a\nmanned space flight program, leaving\nthe hardcore American patriots feeling naked and deserted in a contest\nthat the USA has dominated in recent\nyears. But do we really need manned\nspace flight? Is it beneficial to science?\nWhen J.F. Kennedy set out his vision\nfor the future, he stated we should go\nto the moon \u201cnot because it is easy, but\nbecause it is hard\u201d\n. A great line, but in\nconjunction with the American Dream,\none that has become very distorted, because in the 60\u2019s it was all about beating\nClub Stalin, and in this modern era of\nscientific cooperation this mantra is not\nneeded.\nThe exploration of space is mainly\ndone by robots in unmanned missions\nwhich can fly far off into space, crash\ninto comets and do things which, in\ngeneral, Icarus could not. In terms of\nsheer ability to gather information, a\nrobot in space will be able to go further\ninto the abyss and be far more useful\nto us than a human being would. Also,\nfactor in the fact that food, living quar-ters, toilets, etc. would also have to be\ntransported with a human.\nThe only real human presence in\nspace is the International Space Station. That will be finished (eventually)\nlater this year when all the infrastructure and technology needed to sustain\nthe ISS (resupply missions, astronaut\nswaps, etc.) will already be in place.\nHumans can do more than a machine can: we have intuition, exploration would be faster and we can analyse a rock by picking it up, looking at\nit, licking it and so on, but $81bn for a\nhuman spaceflight (just to the moon)\nis a massive amount of money! That\u2019s\nequivalent to nine LHCs ... nine!!!\nObama\u2019s \u201cvision\u201d is not the end of\nNASA and it won\u2019t be the end of the\nphrase \u201cdeveloped by NASA\u201d or \u201cmade\nfor the NASA space program\u201d which\nhas been exhausted by salesmen eve-rywhere. NASA will still function as\na major developer of new technolo-gies, but this moving of the goal posts\nby the President could yield a completely different outlook on space. In\na comparison with the exploration of\nthe 16th century, when the explorers\nturned from government-backed ones,\nlike Columbus et al., to ones of more\ncommercial nature, like the East India\nCompany.\nIn Obama\u2019s words, he called for a\n\u201cgame change\u201d; this will force NASA\nto come up with something completely different and move the space\nprogram away from an impractical\nand unhealthy nationalistic exhibition\nof power. This will leave NASA able to\nupdate technology that hasn\u2019t changed\nsince the 60\u2019s, change the dynamics of\nspace exploration and explore many\nmore avenues of discovery.\nOne giant leap for NASA\nRichard Howard\nRichard Howard\n\n"

This means that any\ndevice which makes use of a finger to\nmove up and down a window would\ntechnically be covered by Apple\u2019s pat-ent. These ideas are so blindingly obvious and fundamental to touch screen\ndesign that it\u2019s hard to think they could\neven really be classed as \u2018inventions\u2019.\nApple are not however completely to\nblame, as in some way they are \u2018victims\u2019 (if you could call them that) of a\nbroken patent law system.\nIn the US, software patents are granted for almost any new concept or idea\nin the software world. The point about\npatents is that you are only meant to\nbe able to patent actual implementations of an idea meaning only a particular system of components would\nbe covered by it. However, the patents\ngranted to Apple, and many other\nsoftware companies be-sides, are so general as to cover any implementation where the system could\nbe used. For example, the patent for\nlist scrolling covers any touch screen\ndevice that has a processor, memory\nand is trying to move or resize a document or window. It\u2019s hard to think of a\nsituation where a touch-sensitive machine would be trying to move a window without a processor, so this is so\ngeneral as to cover any touch screen\ndevice invented. This means that any\ndevice which does this, violates Apple\u2019s\npatent.\nThe objection to situations like this\nis that patents should not cover inventions that many people could easily create independently of each other\nand should not impede development\nof ideas, like the list scrolling example\nabove. Clearly though, software patents can and do protect some genuinely good and useful ideas, such as\nsecurity or cryptographic concepts\nthat took a lot of work to create. The\nline between trivial and non-trivial\nsoftware inventions is not universally\nagreed upon, being drawn in different\nplaces in different countries. The US\nsystem is notoriously lenient on how\noriginal or obvious the new software\ndesign needs to be.\nWhat this leads to is companies applying for as many patents as they can\nfor ideas that are as general as they\ncan get away with, effectively buying\nup patent \u2018real estate\u2019 for their own\nuse. Obviously, this can lead to problems with one company owning\nsome pieces of a design\nand another company\nowning the rest,\nmeaning that noone has enough\npatents to make a\nfinished product without licencing. As this is\nclearly ri-diculous, there seems to have been a\n\u2018gentlemen\u2019s agreement\u2019 between the\nbig mobile companies over the past\nfew years, creating a \u2018don\u2019t sue me and\nI won\u2019t sue you\u2019 situation. As long as\nno-one sues anyone else the system\nworks, because the companies know it\nonly takes a court case for one patent\nto open the floodgates for themselves\nto be hit by a load of litigation in retali-ation. So why has Apple now decided\nto break this unwritten rule?\nEarlier this February, Google enabled \u2018pinch-to-zoom\u2019, a feature that the\niPhone is famous for, on some of its\nnewer Android phones including the\nNexus One. This is technically in violation of one of Apple\u2019s software patents\nmentioned earlier, and this time Apple\nhave decided to sue. HTC are liable because even though they don\u2019t make the\nsoftware they do manufacture and sell\nthe phone, and so are responsible for\nits features. It may be that Apple is trying to indirectly harm Google, who is\nnow beginning to be seen as a serious\ncompetitor, by stifling its phone business in the US. Compared to other industry leaders like Microsoft or Nokia,\nGoogle and HTC have relatively few\nsoftware patents relevant to Apple\u2019s\nbusiness and so are limiting the damage that any return litigation can do to\nthem via the same method.\nSome commentators have also suggested that Apple may have taken the\nadaption of its original ideas by Google\nand HTC personally. It\u2019s impossible\nto deny that the iPhone was a revolution in mobile design. Most phones\nup to that point had relied on a hard\nkeyboard, navigation keys and a sty-lus. Apple pioneered many new ideas\nthat have been universally taken up by\nalmost all other touch-screen phone\nmanufacturers. Some have suggested\nthe powers that be at Apple are disgruntled at working hard to create this\n\u2018design revolution\u2019 and seeing\nothers reap the rewards. Is Apple simply frus- trated\nI\nt\u2019s been a short week for technology here at the felix towers and\nas such we haven\u2019t got a Weekly\nWrap-Up for you, sorry. But Simon this week has a good look into\nwhat\u2019s going on with what could be the\nstart of the Touchscreen Patent Wars\n(you heard it here first folks). Apple\nVs. HTC, which is actually Apple Vs.\nGoogle with HTC caught in the cross-fire, in a fight over touchscreen interaction patents. Messy stuff, but check\nout the article on your left for the inside scoop.\nApple\u2019s iPad went up for pre-order\nthis week in the US, with some 50-90,000 rumoured to have been bought.\nApple\u2019s already warned people in-store\nthat there\u2019s going to a shortage of the\nfabled tablet when it launches on the\n3rd of April. Of course in the UK, we\u2019re\ngoing to have to wait till \u2018late April\u2019 before fanboys can rush to the church of\nApple and get their grubby mitts on it.\nWill it be a run-away success? Well if\npre-orders are anything to go by, it\u2019s\ngoing to be at least as successful as the\noriginal iPhone launch.\nSupport documents, that went live\nthis week, also showed that the iPad is\ntreated a little differently by Apple than\nit\u2019s staple, the iPhone. When your iPad\nbattery needs replacing $50 will buy you\nnot only a new iPad battery but a whole\nnew iPad. Deal of a century if you ask me,\nbut then again it\u2019s unlikely to be a new\n\u2018off the shelf\u2019 variety and more likely a refurbished unit. Nothing to sniff at mind\nyou, because by the time your battery\nis getting tired, so too is the rest of the\ndevice. Gone will be that perfect finish and \u2018Apple lustre\u2019; so getting all\nthat back and a new battery for $50\nsounds great to me. Now all I have\nto do is figure out wether an iPad really has a future in my device port-folio. Not convinced myself, yet.\nthat their key design has been copied?\nYou have to wonder though if they\ncould really be so na\u0457ve as to think\nthat creating such an original device\nwouldn\u2019t set new standards in phone\ndesign.\nYou\u2019ve also got to wonder how Apple think winning this case could possibly help them. Ignoring the fact that\nthis is really bad publicity that could\nresult in a consumer backlash, it\u2019s very\nunlikely that Google will simply walk\naway from this case and leave the mobile market altogether. The more likely\nsituation is that they\u2019ll go back to the\ndrawing board and keep working until\nthey come up with ideas that are even\nmore revolutionary than the iPhone.\nYou can bet your bottom dollar that\nwhatever they come up with they won\u2019t\nbe willing to share with Apple. Does\nApple really think that it\u2019s the only one\nwho can come up with new ideas?\nThe natural extension of behaviour\nlike this is that everyone keeps their\nnew patents and technologies to them-selves. It\u2019s ridiculous to think that the\nnext generation of iPods or Zunes\ncould end up with fewer features than\ntheir predecessors because everyone is\nso scared of violating patent law and\nunwilling to pay huge licence fees. This\njust stifles innovation and sets back\nprogress on mobile technology. Plus,\nall these suits cost money and eventually that cost has to pass on to the con-sumers. If Apple really care about the\nmobile device marketplace (and they\nshould, because it makes up a large majority of their income) then they should\ndo the intelligent thing and drop the\nsuit, using the money they would have\nspent\nSamuel Gibbs\nSamuel Gibbs Technology Editor\n\n"

Probably for some, and unfortunately for me, it is partly negative.\nI forgot to submit my manifesto to\nthe elections website. Even though\nthere is no excuse for that, other than\njust completely forgetting because I\nsent it to felix (the deadline for which\nwas 2 days earlier) and Live!, what\nhappened afterwards really made me\nrealise that something is not right.\nI discovered the absence of the\nmanifesto 10 minutes before the voting started, and obviously, the first reaction was to send an email with the\nrequired stuff attached, apologising\nfor the late submission. The next day,\nI got a reply saying that it had been 4\ndays past the deadline, hence NO.\nHowever, a remark was also made\nsaying that \u201cunlike other candidates\nwhose manifestos was submitted\nwithin 12 hours of the deadline and\nwere marked late, yours was 4 DAYS\nLATE\u201d. Well, the exact citation of the\ncandidates\u2019 pack is \u201cany manifestos\nsubmitted after the deadline below\nwill not be published at all\u201d. If we\nare to trust that, then 12 hours and\n4 days are the same thing. So where\nwas it said that within 12 hours the\nmaterial would still be published?\nNowhere. Was it explained in which\ncase the material will be submitted\nand marked \u201c\u2019late\u201d, or not submitted\nat all? No.\nSo I was advised to appeal to the\nElections Committee. I did, but got\na reply about upholding the original\ndecision on the following grounds: \u201cas\nthe other candidates are not running\nin the same elections as you, it would\nnot be unfair to publish their manifestos and not yours.\u201d But hey, it wasn\u2019t\nme who mentioned them and made a\ncomparison in the first place, so that\nhas to be relevant. I was advised to\nappeal to Union Court directly, but\nfor the last 2 days of the week the returning officer was not in the office.\nMeaning that the elections would be\nover before I could do anything else.\nSeeing how my complaint was being\npassed around different committees,\nbeing delayed, and how I was being\npresented with various contradictory\narguments. I decided not to fight this\nbureaucratic regime \u2013 after all, my\ncase was against the Union, so who\nwould I be getting support from? Not\nsigning a \u2018no recourse to complain\u2019\ndocument would mean delaying the\nelection results by at least a week and\nthus sabotaging other candidates\u2019\ncampaigns...\nI believe I was treated unfairly, so I\nwould encourage President-elect Alex\nKendall to pay greater attention to\nsuch small details, and to also get rid\nof this bureaucracy mentioned that is\npresent in the current Sabbatical Office. After all, that would mean a more\npersonal approach, which is kind of\nwhat people want, isn\u2019t it?\nStanislavTarasovisn\u2019thappyaboutelections\n\u201c...my complaint\nwas being passed\naround different\ncommittees, being\ndelayed... various\ncontradictory\narguments...\u201d\n\n"
