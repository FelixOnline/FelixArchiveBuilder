This means that the few of you who\nactually paid for it before can save your money, and the\nmajority who used to pinch it anyway can now do so with\na clear conscience. In order to recover our small losses' due\nto lack of sales income, and a larger print order of 2000,\nwe are restricting each issue to an eight page format. The\neditorial staff will therefore be able to exert more critical\ninfluence on what they print, which should lead to a higher\nstandard of Felix during the coming year. If you have any\ninformation about your club, society, or team which you\nthink is worthy of inclusion in Felix, then please drop it in\nto the Felix rack in the union building, or give it to Dave\nSugden, Maths II, who will edit Felix this year. Felix at this\ntime of year is always short of staff and this year is of\ncourse no exception, so if you would like to join Felix for\nthe coming year look out for our stand on Freshers Day or\ncome along to press meetings which happen on Tuesdays and\nThursdays at about 12.45 p.m. in the press room at the top\nof the Union building (Int. 2881).\nI would however like to point out that although the editor\nalways welcomes articles he reserves the sole right to decide\nwhat articles will be included in Felix and whether an article\nshould be cut or lengthened to fill the available space.\nFinally I would like to wish Dave Sugden and next year's Felix staff the best of British luck because by God they\nneed it John Rogers.\n* * * * * * * *\n| This issue of Felix, the newspaper of Imperial JI College Union, was edited and produced by John'\nI Rogers, with assistance from John West, Tony|\nI Kirkham, John McCullough, Jane Cornish, Mike|\n| Griffiths, Tony Sim s,et al.

Now you know.\nDon't blame me, you decided to come here, it's not\nmy fault, if you'd asked me\nI'd have told you, but you\nprobably wouldn't have lis-ten ed, it's your choice, nothing to do with me.\nWhat's that, John?\nOh yeah, I forgot. Sorry.\nWelcome to Imperial College! Get yourself settled in,\nhave a good look round, this\nis a fantastic place! You'll\nhave the time of your life\nhere! Make yourself at home\nyou lucky people!\nO.K.? Right, well, as I was say-ing, what you do now you're\nhere doesn't make any sodding difference to me, or anyone else for that matter, so I don't see why I should waste\nmy time playing silly-buggers\nto welcome you, but it won't do any good complaining or\nasking you all to piss off, so\nI 'll get on with it, I suppose.\nHave you all got somewhere to live? Easy! You\nshould find yourself a nice\nlittle self-contained beautifully furnished flat less than\na mile away from college for\na couple of quid a week; that\nwill set you up nicely for a good year's uninterrupted\nwork! Of course you might\nfind yourself one of the small\nmajority of students living in\na rat-infested cupboard two\nhours from college, complete\nwith hot and cold running\ndamp, with half your grant\ngoing in deposit, but that's your hard luck, mate, sod off\nand commute from somewhere cheaper. Like Uxbridge. Or Brighton.\nSocial life? No problem!\nEnjoy yourself any way you\nlike, indulge your every whim.\nWhat are the Union, the\nclubs, committees, for but to\nhelp you relax as you want\nto? You do like drinking and\nwatching TV don't you? It\ndon't bother me if you don't, please yourself. Mind, doing\nten hours work every night to\nkeep yourself on a pass\ndegree might interfere with\nyour social life, but wait!\nYour Union is there to protect your interests! And believe me, if the Union this\nyear is only half as effective\nas it was last year, it'll be\ntwice as eff ing useless.\nA go-ahead personality!\nImmerse yourself in Union\npolitics, become one of the\npeople in the know! It'll bugger your degree up no end,\nwon't make you universally\nloved, but if masturbating in\npublic's your cup of tea, that's your business, you won't be\nalone, just keep away from\nme, OK?\nWhat else? Some people\nlike it here. It's got some good\npoints (like the end of term\n\u2014Ed.). It's near the Albert\nHall. And Hyde Park. The\nwelfare facilities are pretty\ngood, and the beer's not bad.\nAnd remember, if you have\nany problems, anything on\nyour mind, any worries or\ncomplications at all, don't hesitate, don't be afraid, go\nand find someone to talk to,\nanyone, I don't bleeding-well\ncare, just don't sodding-well\nget in my way.\nI don't know nothing about\nit, hear, it ain't got nothing to\ndo with me, SOD OFF.\n'Colcutf is the pseudonym under which a Union personality,\nknown only to the Editor, writes in each issue of FELIX.\nNo doubt, for fresher s, your first week or two in College\nwill show what a lot the Union has to offer, both of a social\nand Recreational and of a Service and Representational\nnature.\nOld lags Will know this already, but they will recognise\nthat there is always more to be done\u2014some tasks concern\nold thorny problems, others concern newer ones, but none\nare for that of lesser importance.\nOptional Diversification\nThis is the problem (i.e. to get it) that has been with us\nthe longest, and if we do not press hard will stay with us the\nlongest. Many of us have found ourselves trapped, not\nrealising the full meaning and narrowness of specialized\n\"education\"\u2014often a soul-destroying repetition of lectures\nand pra et ical s and facts and figures on the same subjects\nwith no attempt made to relate them to the outside world\nand especially poorer developed areas where such knowledge\ncould be put to great use. A few professors and lecturers\nare trying, but this should be COLLEGE POLICY\u2014we've\ngot to show our continued support for them, and aid them.\nThe Exam System is very closely related to the above. Initiative is needed to\nhelp move away from three hour hit-or-miss exams, and the\nrigid lecture system to one incorporating assessed projects,\ntutorials, open book exams, and maybe eventually continual\nassessment.\nRepresentation\nis a means to getting some of the important ends listed\nabove. Much has been achieved, but important power\npockets of resistance, secrecy, and regression must be opened\nup. All decisions must be taken by the college AS A WHOLE. We must use what representation we have better,\nin order to get our desired aims\u2014make sure it's YOUR\nthings you want us to do. Come and tell us when we do not\n\u2014everyone to the Union Office.\nCome round for a chat sometime. I 'll try to definitely be\nin the Union Office (Beit archway, INT 2488) every Friday\nafternoon, to hear what YOU want so say. After all, that is\nwhat is important round here.\nJohn McCullough.\nLETTERS TO\nTHE EDITOR\nare always welcome, and should be placed in the\nFelix rack, Union lower lounge, by noon on the Wednesday before publication.

    "content": "BINARY SYSTEM V. THE COMPREHENSIVE UNIVERSITY\n(Copy of the N.U.S. Ill ACTION Pamphlet)\nThe Government is expanding higher education in a \"binary system\", dividing autonomous universities from Technical Colleges and Colleges of Education.\nNUS wants to bridge this gulf.1. All students should have equal academic facilities BUT \u00a3581 is spent per annum on a university student for academic facilities. Only \u00a3\n2\n^\n9 for a trainee teacher.\n2. All students should have equal social facilities BUT universities9 unions have an average \u00a38 subscription compared with \u00a33 in Colleges of Education. In Technical Colleges the Government has\nnow granted \u00a33, but only for full timers over 18.\n3\n\u00ab All students should have equal sports facilities BUT many Technical Colleges have facilities below the los f el of local sixth forms. University sport is organised by the BUSF, non university sports\nlack any such body.\nh.All students should be equally housed\nBUT, although university accommodation is inadequate, Technical College\naccommodation is virtually non-existent.\n5. All students need to mix with those studying other subjects\nBUT trainee teachers and technical college students are isolated from\nother disciplines.6. Teaching and technology are essential to national progress\nBUT sixth-former s naturally try to avoid going to Colleges with poor\nconditions. The Binary System is: SOCIALLY DIVISIVE\nUNFAIR TO STAFF AND STUDENTS\nEDUCATIONALLY UNSOUND\nN.U.S. IS FIGHTING FOR:\n1. Comprehensive universities bringing together all students and courses.\n2. A fair balance of central control and internal freedom for all colleges.3. Equality for staff and students.\nRECENTLY WE HAVE GAINED:\n1. More money for LEA College Unions\n2. A promise of housing for polytechnic students\n3. Increased catering grants for LEA Colleges. FOR MORE PROGRESS YOUR HELP IS NEEDED\nStudents should take a lead in breaking down these barriers by social nixing with other colleges, joint union activities and amalgamation of clubs and\nsocieties.

In the\nOpen event, the Allom Cup,\na very strong IC crew containing Four Purples made\neasy work of Middlesex\nHospital and U.C.&H. In the\nJunior division the going was\na bit tougher, the 2nd VIII\nholding off Guys Hospital to\nwin the Roderick-Hill tro-ph y. The highest number of\nentries was in the Novice\ndivision, where IC beat the\nfavourites Middlesex Hospital and then went on to\nwin in the final against\nQ.M. C. and Guys. The final\nwas a most traumatic affair\nwith 6 catching a crab 30\nseconds from the finish, but\nIC recovered their composure to win by 2 lengths. IC\nalso won the cox less IV's and\nthe pairs.\nThe outstanding crew in\nthe club have been the 2nd VIII who through the determination of their captain\nAndy Hill won Juniors at\nBrent regatta, after having\npicked up U.L. Juniors two\nweeks previously.\nVictory also came to the\n1st VIII in the Metropolitan\nRegatta, where they beat\nWestminster School and\nLondon 'B' to Win the coveted Forster Cup.\nIn cox less IV's IC won at\nCambridge Regatta. The\ncrew was: D.H. Bardsley,\nP. Rowley, B. Mc Doual, C. Nicholls.\nThe results of the internal\nregatta were as follows:\nPairs: D. Sorton, V.C. Spencer. Senior Sculls: A. Ponsford. Junior Sculls: H. Evans. Novice Sculls: S. Rotherham.\nNew members will be\nmade very welcome, no previous rowing necessary \u2014\nand cox es too. B.N. Black.\nater-Polo\nin Yugoslavia\nThe Yugoslavs won the\n1968 water-polo Olympics.\nThey also have an exquisite\ncoastline bordering the Adriatic Sea. What better place\ncould there be for an enjoyable holiday and an opportunity to see some very professional water-polo. With\nthis in mind, the I.C. water-polo club arranged for a ten\nday tour to Yugoslavia in\nmid-August.\nWater-polo is a passion in\nSlavic countries. In Yugoslavia, 5it ranks second to\nfootball as the national\nWm-M. iii1?:?: \u2122\nPI iMp f sport. Every child living by\nthe sea or near a pool will\neventually come into contact with this sport. Therefore it is understandable\nthat the quality is very high\nand that much can be gained\nfrom contact with Yugoslavian teams, LC. did not win\nvery many matches during\ntheir stay. However they did\nlearn a great deal from some\nvery high class players. The\nadvice and suggestions were\ngiven freely and most of all\nenthusiastically. Improvement was visible over the\nperiod of our short ten day\nstay. It consisted mainly in\na rearrangement of our\npriorities. To play good\nwater-polo, three qualities\nare desirable in a player:\ngood swimming, good ball\nhandling and good shooting.\nOver and above this, a team\nmust be able to play a coherently and cannot rely on individual superstars. Most\nBritish teams have good individual players but seem to\nlack the skill of playing as\na team. I think this fact was\ndemonstrated quite clearly\nto us during our stay.\nOn the lighter side, what\nis there to be said about our\nholiday? Oh the usual I guess: blue sky, sunshine,\nclear cool water, good food,\ncheap wine, all that sort of\nthing.\nOne last thing. In Yugoslavia, you may be surprised\nto learn that it's difficult to\nget a seat to watch a water-polo match unless you come\nvery early.\nMarc Garraeau.\nArticles for the\nsports page of the\nnext FELT X must\nbe put in the Felix\nrack before noon\non Thursday, 21st October.\nFELIX FILM REVIEWS 'Soldier Blue' is one of\nthose unfortunate films that\nevery time it opens its\nmouth it lets out ac liche. The final massacre is a mixture of 'The Wild Bunch'\nstylistic s and crude close-ups\nof amputated limbs and\ndripping gore. Symbolic\nmassacre aside 'Soldier Blue'\nis a fairly average Western\nwith almost two hours of\nyawn producing celluloid.\nIt's a shame about Luchino Visconti being such a variable quantity in the\nCinema: his last film, 'The\nDamned', was a very bad\nfilm but his latest film,\n'Death in Venice', is a mas-ter piece. The excellently\nfilmed story of a German\ncomposer's( Dirk Bogarde)\nemotional attraction to a young Polish boy (Bjorn\nAnderson). The film is beautifully photographed, acted\nand directed. Dialogue is\nkept to a minimum and the\nattraction between the composer and the boy comes\nover very well even though\nthey never speak to each\nother. Altogether the decaying splendour of Venice in\n191.1 is the atmosphere that\nVisconti has managed to\ncapture in this excellent film.\nI'm sure that Tchaikovsky\nwasn't as troubled by sex as\nKen Russell portrays him in\nhis film 'The Music Lovers'.\nHis story attributes all his\nproblems to his sex life. But\nignoring the basic premises\nof the script the film is very\ngood. It is in no way as good\nas 'Death in Venice' but it\nwas a very good film. Ken\nRussell is a relative newcomer to films coming from\ntelevision where his films on\nother composers also used\nthe same basic premise as in\n'The Music Lovers'. His\ngrasp of film techniques is\nexcellent and he has used\nthem to the full. Yet his\nhandling of one major incident in Tchaikovsky's life (his\nattempted suicide) where he\nchanged the attempted\ndrowning on a bitterly cold\nnight to a short paddle on a Summer afternoon. The\nmusic is very good (but a little loud) and the fantasy\nscene for the 1:812 Overture\nwas very enjoyable. Overall\na film worth seeing if only\nto compare it with the proposed film on Tchaikovsky\nwhich ought to be very similar ito 'Song of Norway' and\nvery Hollywood-ish.\nA couple of films that are\nreally for aficionados of\nthe stars: Pennebaker's 'Don't Look Back': the documentary film of Bob\nDylan's tour of England in\n1965. And 'Joan' (American\ntitle 'Carry it on') about\nJoan Baez or more particularly her husband David\nHarris, and is a documentary of Joan's life just before\nand after he went to prison\n(for resisting the draft). Both\nfilms are made in the best\ntradition of cinema-ve rite. This is where you have to\nreally like the artists, because you can't hear the dialogue for most of the time;\na lot of the dialogue ha\n'Don't Look Back' was, apparently very amusing, and I didn't hear a word: a lot of\nthe dialogue in 'Joan' was\nvery meaningful and again I didn't hear a word. I'm not\ncomplaining about all the\ncinema - ve rite techniques;\nthe camera movements can\nbe very effective, but it\nwouldn't take too much\nSummer\nConferences\nEach year the main lecture\ntheatres in Imperial College\nare let out to various noted\ninstitutions and societies so\nthat they can hold their\nannual get-together s, and the\nCollege can make some\nmoney. Among the more in-testing was the 2nd World\nConference on Smoking and\nHealth. This attracted several\nnoted people, including Tory\nMinister of Health (what\nabout school milk?) At the\nend of the week of lectures\nan International Campaign\nwas launched against smoking\n(retiring editor of FELIX\nplease note).\nAnother conference was entitled Disaster Technology. It\nwas run by an I.C. student\nJohn Murlis, who had been to\nBangla Desh doing relief\nwork. Whilst there he felt\nthat there were several inadequacies in the work being\ndone by the so called relief\norganisations out there, and\nso he and other students\nstarted a group called the\nLondon Technical Group to\ninvestigate the many problems facing these organisations. One conference, which slipped by almost unnoticed was\none sponsored by NATO. It\nseemed to be a gathering of\nall the world's greatest Uranium geologists. In a time when\nthere is increasing opposition\nto military research projects\nat I.C. perhaps it would be a good idea if the organisations\nusing I.C. facilities should be\nvetted to see if their aims are\nin agreement with those of\nthe students.\nJohn Sommer.\nSITUATIONS VACANT Large numbers of oarsmen are required by l.C. Boat Club. Apply to the Boat house, Putney. effort to improve the quality\nof the soundtrack.\nAnother very good film\nI have seen was 'Bronco\nBullfrog' which as Filmsoc.\nmembers will know (when\nthey join!) is being shown at\nI.C. in February. This was\nyet another film that was ignored by the distributors. I shall review the film nearer\nthe show date because the\nchances of seeing ait in a commercial cinema are very\nslim, but it is well-worth\nseeing so go to see it when\nit comes to I.C.

The editorial\nstaff can be again seen scratching their\ngreying heads and asking what happened\nduring the week that is interesting and\nprintable. At the same time as this is hap-pen ing, the photographic editor is busily\ntrying to transform the vertical pictures to\nfit horizontal spaces and vice-versa.\nThe final pages then begin to shape up\nby a process not dissimilar to that of the\nfirst pages. One member of the staff is then\ndetailed to entertain the printers' representative, our great friend Mr. Milsom,\nwhile this process is completed with great\nhaste. He then transports the pages to the\nprinters who bring these ten days' work\nto harsh reality.\nThe photos below show various views of\nthe printing machines which produce\nFELIX. The process is described in the\ncaptions below the photos.\nThe photo below shows in greater detail the\nprocess of setting up the type, photos and adverts\nin the frames ready for printing.

    "content": "Page 4 FELIX October 4, 1971\nTO\nBorn in a beer y, smoky hole, or perhaps several, mishandled by\nille te rate students, how does FELIX ever reach the newstands ?\nThe initial preparatory work on the next issue is due to start the\nThursday the previous FELIX finally emerges by some miraculous\nprocess. Throughout the following week articles trickle in, are\nsub-edited and sent for typing. The page layouts are concocted and\nsent by special messenger (G.P.O. for short) to our printers, Baileys.\nThe type is then set, the proofs returned for checking and finally\nFELIX is printed to reach us on the Wednesday before publication.\nFelicity is churned out on the Wednesday, collated into FELIX,\nand the finished literary masterpiece is unveiled.\nThat is the theory; now for the practice. O.K. Day one is the day\nof recovery and conception; the editor sits in the press room with\nthe rest of his staff, scratching his head and saying \"Well lads, what\nshall we put in the next one?\" This process continues sporadically\nbetween pints until the weekend when the first pages have to be sent\nto Baileys.\nAlt this point the press room telephone glows red with constant use\nas the reporters and other contributors are chased for their articles.\nWhen the articles, mainly features at this stage, finally arrive they\nare sub-edited and typed, then the fun starts.\nThe articles, now readable, are proof read and instructions relating\nto size and type of print, column width and other mysterious instructions are included for the benefit(?) of the type setters. The layout\nof each individual page is then decided upon.\nThis is the real hairy stage of the process \u2014 trying to squash or\nstretch each article to fit the available space, decide roughly the\nshape and size of the photographs which depends on the subject and\nthe aesthetic tastes of the editorial staff.\nThese conceptions are then transferred into semi reality on the\nlayout sheets which then accompany the copy to the printers.\nThis process continues throughout the week until the Sunday before\npublication.\nOn arrival at the printers the photos are separated from the\ncopy and sent to the room shown below. In this photo the\nmachine operator can be seen setting up the raw material\nfor making a photographic block. The photo is placed\nunder the plate, and the machine arm is lowered. Hey Presto,\nten minutes later, a plate, wonderful stuff this science you\nknow.\nMany thanks to\nBailey's staff for their\nco-operation in the\nproduction of this\narticle.\nWmm \u2022SOMETHING FOR NOTHING Be amongst first 300 customers to spend more than \u00a37*50 at I.C. Bookshop[223 College Block] and get your free gift\nExpert, friendly assistance given at all times We look forward to meeting you! FROM LAYOUT TO PROOFS... The copy or the actual wording of\nthe articles, however, follows a different process and is taken to the\ntype setters. In the photo on the far\nleft, one can see the various linotype\nmachines in the background which\nare used for setting the type. In the\nforeground of the same photograph\ncan be seen the pages of type,\nphotos, etc., being set in their frames\nready for printing. The type is set by\ntwo different means, depending on\nthe size and style of type face being\nused. The large letters are set by\nhand from ready made type one\nletter at a time and this process is\nshown in the photograph directly\nabove. The two photos to the left\nshow how the bulk of the type is\nset by linotype machine. Each letter\nhas its own individual die or matrix.\nThese are selected by the keyboard\nfrom the magazine which can be seen\nat the top of the upper photo. The\nwords and spaces formed in this\nway are assembled in a line, which\nwhen complete forms a mould into\nwhich is pumped a molten alloy of\nlead, tin and antimony, which forms\nthe actual print used to produce the\nnewspaper. The line is then trimmed\nand ejected onto the storage galley\n(which can be seen above the keyboard in the photo bottom left). The\ndies used to mould the lines are then\nreturned automatically to their respective spaces in the storage maga-zines. As a large number of magazines are available, many different\nsizes and styles of type can be used\nsuch as BOLD, ROMAN, ITALIC.\nWhen the pages are set up, the type\nis inked and proofs returned to\nFELIX for checking.\n\n"

    "content": "IMPERIAL COLLEGE UNION, 4th OCTOBER, 1971 No. 302\nFELIX\nGOES\nFREE\nP.G. GRANTS Following the announcement, in late spring, of a rise in\nthe value of undergraduate grants comes the news that a similar rise in value of Post-Graduate Science Research Council Studentships will be effected from 1st October 1971.\nThe grants will rise in three steps yearly from that date as\nfollows :\u2014\n1970/71 1971/72 1972/73 1973/74\n\u00a3550 \u00a3630 \u00a3650 \u00a3675\nStudents living\naway from home\nStudents living\nat home \u00a3425 \u00a3485 \u00a3500 \u00a3520\nIn addition to this P.G.' s will in future be able to obtain a reimbursement of travelling expenses incurred over a total\nof \u00a315, in any year, and the limit of other income earned by\npost graduates which falls into the non-deductible category\nhas been raised from \u00a3100 to \u00a3175.\nThese are all items that N.U.S. have been campaigning for\nin the past and items on which Imperial College Union has\nbrought great pressure, the introduction of the travel allowance proving the value of such pressure. The outstanding issue\nbeing followed at the moment is that of disparity between\nP.G. demonstrating fees, and the Union feels that discrepancies between one institution and another must be removed.\nIn the motion which Imperial College Union will put to the\nN.U.S. meeting at Margate in November, they will be welcoming these recent successes whilst stressing the fact that\nthey are still insufficient. The major point which still needs\nstressing is the need for a re-evaluation of the method of calculating the S. R.C. grant. The method used at present has the\nfollowing structure, the amounts shown being those for 197071:\u2014\u00a3380 basic for the period of undergraduate attendance\nwith an addition of 17 weeks at \u00a31 a day and a general \u00a350\nallowance on top of this, which all rounds up nicely to the\npresent \u00a3550.\nPost-graduates still do not get a London allowance and\nmost important is the fact that the expenses incurred in the\nproduction of their theses have to be taken from their maintenance grant which has no specific allowance for this. As in\nsome cases this can amount to \u00a3100, an additional allowance\nin the final year's grant or a separate money allocation for\nthis purpose is imperative.\nThe whole method of evaluating P.G. grants at present does\nnot take into account the fact that undergraduates have 20\nweeks of holiday in which to supplement their income, a privilege not open to P.G.' s. I.C.U. will be trying to highlight these deficiencies at Margate but your support will be needed to carry these proposals\nthrough and also to check any government attempt to introduce a system of loans for post-graduates.\nPIERS...\nCollege Political victim is ation fails\nFelix is pleased to report\nthat the physics department\nhave not succeeded in throwing out Piers Corbyn, left\nwing former president and\neditor of SENNET.\nDuring the summer a battle has been raging between\nPiers and the physics department over the possible\nwithdrawal of his grant, for\nthe coming session. The\nstruggle began in July and\nhas involved in addition to\nPiers and college, the Science\nResearch Council, for whom\nPiers obtains his grant,\nICASTMS, Imperial College\nUnion, NUS and a few\nothers, all of whom took up\nPiers' case. The battle has\ninvolved mounds of communication between the various participants and all concerned must be praised for\nthe way in which everything\nwas so amicably carried\nout.\nPiers has been at college\nfor three years as a PG one\nof which he spent as president and the other two of\nwhich he was supported by\nSRC to do research.\nOn July 7th he was told\nby his supervisor that his\n\"academic performance during the year had not justified\na recommendation to SRC\nthat his research studentship\nbe continued for its third\nyear\", but that he could finish what he was doing and\nsubmit it for a DIC and\nM. Phil this October. These\ntwo statements were later\nconfirmed in writing by a letter to Piers from his head\nof department Professor\nMatthews on July 13th. Assurances Piers appealed against the\ndecision and on July 8th gave assurances to college\nthat he would finish the work\nfor his Ph.D. by October '72,\neven though PG's are not\nContinued on page 8\nNews in Br \u2022\nie fs PHALLUSY TIME\nIt has come to the notice of FELIX\nthat a certain Union official, during the\ninstallation of those notorious machines\nin the Union bog, received a not inconsiderable number of free samples\nfrom the London Rubber Company.\nFELIX are sceptical as to whether\nthese will be put to use. That is, other\nthan blowing them up as balloons ! We\nwonder whether any Union official will\nbe able to negotiate a sufficient discount\non these items in order for FELIX to\narrange a free gift this Christmas.\nIMPERIAL GASCOIGNE\nApparently, Granada Television have\nbeen rash enough to invite a team from\nImperial College to participate in University Challenge. Four team members\nplus one reserve are required. Budding\nintellectuals should give their names\nand addresses to Linda in the Union\nOffice. Granada will also arrange a free\ntrip to Manchester for supporters, 40 in\nnumber, to watch the recording. Applications also to Linda.\nBRUSH OFF\nAs the tortuous channels of communication reopen, FELIX has received a request, via the Registrar at\nR.C.A., the Domestic Bursar, and John\nMcCullough, in that order, that I.C. students should not in future use the\nrefectory at the Royal College of Art.\nApparently, R.C.A. students object to\nqueuing longer, particularly since the\nvast minority of I.C. students made any\neffort to integrate in the minutest sense.\nFreshers may be interested that R.C.A. salads were economical, and a very\npleasant change from Mooney's.W. L.S.A. B. This means the West London Students Accommodation Bureau. This\nautumn in the Union Office Mike\nMuller (ex I.C.) has been running a service unrivalled anywhere in London\n\u2014an Accommodation Bureau for students not run by a couple of old ladies\n(mentioning no names). After placing\nadvertisements in several local newspapers he has obtained a vast number\nof addresses of flats, beds its and digs\nwhich he has been dishing to students\nand the like at the rate of about 30 a week. He still has many addresses\nespecially digs so if you are still without a place to live pop into the Union\noffice and see him.\nTENANCY SCHEME IN\nRAVENSCOURT PARK\nThe College recently acquired the\nleases of eight flats in Ravenscourt Park\n(two minutes from the District line\ntube station). The flats are in excellent\ncondition and are generally better than\nthose that students would normally\nfind.\nEach of the flats has two cookers,\ntwo sinks, two bathrooms, a refrigerator and similar furnishings. Fifty-eight\nstudents will be housed, mainly in\ndouble rooms but there is also a small\nnumber of single rooms.\nThis is only a pilot scheme and it is\nhoped that if successful there will be a large expansion into this form of\naccommodation as there are no building or planning worries.\nA further advantage is the complete\nfreedom that the scheme allows the\nresidents\u2014there are no wardens or sub-wardens.\nFRENCH LETTERS TO THE\nEDITOR\nComplaints regarding the aforementioned machine and the contents thereof should not be addressed to the editor\nof FELIX who wishes to stress that he\nis in no way responsible. He also denies\nthat FELIX will be running a controversial \"French letters to the editor\"\ncolumn. Next week: FELIX Consumer\nUnit reports. Coming shortly: Road\nTest.\n\n"

The\nusual solo effort has been superceded this year by a combined attack on the pockets of Londoners by I.C.U. and other College unions in the area.

Academic Affairs\nOfficer, is aimed at clearing up the great \"What is Academic\nAffairs?\" mystery.\nAcademic Affairs is a subject of student activity that on\nthe whole receives very little publicity, yet it is the one area\nthat concerns and involves every student, whether u.g. or\np.g. In (the broadest sense, it covers everything to do with\nyour education here at Imperial College from straightforward complaints about a poor lecturer to fundamental\nquestions such as \"Should we be getting a more specialised\nor more general education?\" or \"What should be the scientists' role vis-a vis the community?\"\nSTAFF/STUDENT COMMITTEES\nOne of the main concerns is collecting students' views and\nputting them across to the staff. The heart of Academic\nAffairs is the STAFF/STUDENT COMMITTEE (one in\neach department) where staff and students discuss any\ndepartmental matter from an unsatisfactory course to the\nprovision of common-room facilities. Staff are always willing\nto hear suggestions for improvements and numerous changes\nin courses are made yearly as a result of student opinion.\nEach u.g. year has at least one ACADEMIC REP on this\ncommittee (the first year elect theirs near the end of October).\nHe should be constantly probing you for your Views and\nkeeping you informed. In addition, there should be at least\none p.g. rep on the committee\u2014to enable p.g' s. to become\nmore involved\u2014and two other students:\nThe first is the I.C.U. Departmental Rep (one for each\ndepartment); he (or she!) is the main organiser on the\nstudent Side and resident 'expert' on what's what! The\nsecond is the Constituent College Academic Affairs Officer,\nWho? Why?\nwho sits on all the S.S.C. s in his college, and hence coordinates their activities.\nFinally, it's my job to co-ordinate the whole lot through\nthe I.C.U. Academic Affairs Committee, which has the three\nConstituent College Academic Affairs Officers and all the\nDepartment Reps on it. This is where overall student policy\nis formulated.\nREPRESENTATION\nOn a wider front, I.C.U. has gained a good deal of representation in the last two years on important College com-mitte es. For example, the President and the four Academic\nAffairs Officers are on the BOARD OF STUDIES, which,\nchaired by the Rector, decides basic Academic policy for the\nCollege. We're now beginning to use these opportunities\nproperly to put over student views at the highest level. And\nso, albeit slowly, students are becoming more involved in\nfuture plans for Imperial College.\nThe other side of Academic Affairs is to encourage you\nto think more about your education, and one of the major\nissues in the last couple of years has been student pressure\nfor the option of a less specialised education.\nTo try to stimulate some greater interest, we're organising\na series of three informal lunch-time discussions (tea and\nsandwiches available) to be held in the UNION SCR (that's above the lower lounge) at 12.30-1.30, on Friday 15th,22 nd and 29th October. The first one's called \"THE SCIENTIST\nIN SOCIETY\"\u2014there will be two speakers. So come along,\nFreshers and old lags alike!\nFRIDAY 15th OCTOBER 12.30 UNION S. C.R. "

In an attempt to break even,\na price rise of 8 per cent in the cafeterias was agreed upon,\nwith effect from Ist August.\nUNION LOUNGE\nWell, you have got past the title anyway which probably\nmeans you either don't know what the Union Lounge is and\nare curious to find out, or you wonder what there is to write\nabout it, well read on.\nThe Union Lounge is situated in the ground floor of the\nUnion Building somewhere between Tarn's office and the\nUnion Bar. Its only purpose in life up till now has been to\nhouse that relic from the days of I.C's. mascot ry, Mike, our\nex-mascot. However since Queen Mary College decided it\nwould make a nice souvenir and nobody at I.C. can be bothered to get it back, our beloved union officials decided to find\na new purpose in life for the lower lounge.\nIn order to give you something to do in the evenings\nand somewhere to go and do\nit, they have had those old\nboards listing their predecessors names removed,\nmoved to the top floor the\nold waiting room type chairs,\nand repainted the lounge\nwith a splattering of orange\nhere and there amongst the\nlight green. The seating now\nconsists of comfortable easy\nchairs, and low coffee tables\nhave been installed to prop\nup the odd pint or four.\nThe apology that used to\nbe known as the ladies bar\nis gone and has been replaced by a fully stocked\nbar which is actually equipped with its own pumps,\n(that's one up for Women's Lib.) The bar also doubles\nas a Snack Bar selling all\nthe best that Mooney\nminions can't ruin, with perhaps even a barmaid for all\nyou lucky fresher s to chat up.\nThe lighting level has been\ndecreased and lis being replaced partly with coloured\nlights which do not flash yet\nbut should improve the atmosphere a lot, who knows\nthey might be able to lower\nthe ceiling a few feet which\nwould make it even better\nstill. Having set this atmosphere they decided to add\nfurther to the attractions by\ninstalling a juke box for those\nof you who haven't got your\nown record grinder, Pin\ntables for you to waste your\ngrants on and possibly a few\nmore of those bar football\ntables to reduce the queues\nat the existing ones. In addition to all these goodies a Mooney coffee machine is\nbeing installed for out of\nhours drinking, so why not\ncome along? Why not bring\na few friends? it will make\na pleasant change from the\natmosphere of Southside, you\nmie ht even find those new\nn ni \u2022\nThe Catering Manager\nhad originally asked for a rise of 13%, but the Union\nfought this down to about\n8%, on the understanding\nthat there would be no further price rises within the\nnext 12 months.\nThe Union won a further\nconcession \u2014 that the prices\nin the Union Buttery (open\ncontinuously from 11.00 a.m. to 6.00 p.m.) would only\nrise by 5%, so that snacks\nin the Union would be\nslightly cheaper than in College Block or Southside.\nMeanwhile the outlook is\ndistinctly rosy in the Bars\n\u2014 too rosy, say Union\nofficials, looking at the\nstartling \u00a36,255 profit, representing nearly 10% of the\nturnover! About a quarter\nof this profit comes from the\nUnion Bar, an eighth from\nCollege Block, and the rest\nfrom Southside Bar.\nUnion officials are concerned that Bar profits\nshould not sub sid is e Refectories, though here the Union\nThe scheme was run this\nsummer by Sue Rossell, Ian\nBurgess, Pete Totterdell and\nTim Russell, with the help\nof other I.C. students who\nacted as cleaners. Ninety-five\nrooms in Linstead were let\nfor twelve weeks at \u00a31 a night or \u00a36 a week raising\napproximately \u00a33800 for a new hall or house. Last year\nthe scheme raised \u00a33000 with\nless rooms available for let-ting; the profit this year\nbeing not as large as expected because the cleaners\nbread increased and also the\nlaundry bills rose.\nLinstead Bar was kept\nopen over the summer to\nprovide a drinking place for\nthe occupants and the takings\ntrebled over those during\nterm time, the profits being\nused to refurbish and stock\nthe bar, hence the new tables\nand chairs, taped music,\ncoloured lights and new bar\nfittings to be seen in Linstead. The success of the\nscheme over the previous two\nyears has ensured its continuation next summer.\nis at variance with Catering\nManager, Mr. Mooney, and\nalso with the latest University Grants Committee memo\nto Universities, which recommends that the bars should\nkeep the refectories solvent.\nThe same U.G.C. memo\nalso advocates the 'moth-balling' of surplus facilities,\nthe need to detect and follow\nthe trend towards cheaper\nmeals and snacks, and the\nadvisability of cutting down\nover-elaborate or uneconomic services such as weekend meals, and waitress ser-vice.\nA more detailed report on\nthe catering services offered\nat I.C. was received over\nthe vacation. The Senior\nCatering Advisor to the\nU.G.C., Miss F.M. Cowell,\ncarried out a three day survey of I.C. refectories in\nMay, mainly at the request\nof the Union.\nHer report points out the\ngross over-provision of catering in the College, which was\ncaused by the opening of\nCollege Block, with eating\nAfter a series of meetings\nover the summer it was decided that all rooms not\nbeing used by conferences or\nI.C. students next year will\nbe used either for block\nbookings or for casual let-tings along the lines of Linstead this year. It was also\ndecided that the profits from\nthe casual bookings should\ngo to the Union for improving student accommodation,\nby obtaining leases on flats\nfor students, for example.\nThe money from block bookings would be divided between halls and houses to\nmaintain their present level\nof rents,\nFELIX thinks that this\nallocation of money to keep\nhall rents at their present\nlevel is giving gold to the\nwell-off. Nobody, least of all\nFELIX staff, wants to see\nhall rents rise but we do feel\nthat people in hall are well\nenough off already and that\nthe money could 'be better\nused to provide more hall-places so that some of those\nnot fortunate enough at\npresent to get into hall will\nhave a better chance in\nfuture. What about the other\n3000 students not lucky\nenough to get into hall \u2014\nwill their rents remain\nstable? Surely this is a short-facilities for 1800, in a year\nwhen student numbers only\nincreased by 100. The opening of College Block was the\nsign for the run-down of facilities in the Union building,\nand also, through an additional wages bill of \u00a316,000,\ncontributed to the \u00a330,000\ndeficit that session.\nOne obvious choice in\nrational ising the Refectories\nwould be to close the Union\nbuilding; however, Miss\nCowell points out the un-desi ir ability of this, as it\nwould deal a heavy blow to\nthe concept of the Union as\nthe hub of student life. Similarly, the staff dining room\nat 170 Queensgate loses\nheavily, but this also should\nbe retained, as it provides an\nelement of gracious Irving.\nHowever, if 170 is kept open,\nMiss Cowell suggests either\nfinding an alternative source\nof money to sub sid is e it, or\nclosing some of the other\nStaff facilities.\nOn the management side,\nMiss Cowell found the management was efficient and\nthe operating staff of good\ncalibre; but she did recommend the appointment of a Deputy Catering Manager to\nease the workload \u2014 this\nhas in fact already been\nagreed by the College.\nThe report now has to\nwend its way via the various\nCollege Committees for official comment.\nsighted view. If all the money\nwas used to acquire new accommodation then more students would benefit from\ncheaper accommodation in\nthe long run.\nDuring future vacations it\nis hoped to let between 100\nand 500 rooms at \u00a31.60 a night for students. This will\ninclude breakfast in Southside, and thus help to keep\nrefectories viable over the\nsummer.\nFELIX wishes Sue Rossell\nand Tim Russell the best of\nluck with the scheme next\nyear, but hopes that the\npowers that be will have\nsecond thoughts about the\ndistribution of profits.\nIllustrated\nHalas\nJohn Halas will be lecturing at Imperial College\nshortly, as a guest of the\nFilm Society.\nAs well as being an expert on the production of\nanimated films, Mr. Halas\nis well known as a speaker\non the subject, and has appeared at the National Film\nTheatre.\nHis lecture will be illustrated with several short\ncartoons, and also an extract\nfrom the famous feature-length film, \"Animal Farm\".\nThe Film Society promises\nample advance publicity.\ncontinued from\npage one\nusually forced to submit their\ntheses by any fixed date at\nthis stage.\nHe also took the somewhat drastic step of submitting a report of his work to\nthe department without one\nbeing requested. His case\nwas at this stage taken up\nby ICU and ASTMS. Prof.\nMatthews refused to listen to\nthe ASTMS as he said that\nthey were not supposed to\ntake up students cases even\nthough they had fought on\nthe side of students several\ntimes in the past.\nAlso at this stage a disagreement started as to\nwhether or not SRC should\nhave been previously informed of Piers unsatisfactory state of progress in the\neyes of the department.\nNO WARNING Judith Walker (retiring\nPresident) wrote to Prof.\nMatthews on July 22nd making the points that:- Piers\nhad a right to be represented by ASTMS if he wished;\nthat he had not been given\nadequate warning; trial there\nis no college requirement that\nPh.D students have to satisfy\ntheir supervisors of any particular state of progress by\nthe end of their second year;\nand that Post Graduates have\nas many rights as undergraduates. On August 3rd the authorities changed their position\nand SRC said that Mr. Corbyn's grant could be continued if the department so\nrecommended by 30th September. Towards the end of\nsummer John McCullough,\nUnion president, joined the\nbattle by writing to Prof.\nMatthews, stating that he\nmachines in the Union bog,\nbring a bird along you might\neven find a use for them.\nThe only remaining\ntrouble is to find a new\nname for this place, and to\nencourage suggestions the\nUnion are offering one hundred pence worth of free\ngoodies from the new . . . .\nWell, it's up to you to think\nof a new name for it and\ngive your suggestions to John\nMcCullough.\nCORBYN\nBUSTED\nOne July evening the\ndrugs squad payed Piers\nCorbyn a visit in his shared\nflat in Notting Hill. They\nhad a search warrant for\ndrugs, soon after entering the\nflat they found a filing cab i net. So quite naturally for\nthem, they radioed the\nSpecial Branch who being\njust around the corner were\nthere within five minutes.\nThe FUZZ found about\n\u00a32 worth of hash \u2014 not\nCorbyns he can't take the\nstuff \u2014 and arrested Piers\nfor admitting his premises to\nbe used for the smoking of\nhash. You might think that\nwas enough but not for the\nspecial branch, they also\naccused him of handling\nstolen property (i.e. one\ntraffic cone, one roadside\nlamp, and one local authority sign pertaining to dogs\nfouling the footpath).\nHowever the main event\nof the night was a search of\nhis political files during\nwhich the S.B.'s took notes\nand asked him numerous\nquestions. After being kept\nin jail for one hour and then\nreleased on \u00a3100 bail, being\nrefused legal aid he appeared\nat magistrates court on\nSept. 21st. Piers pleaded1 guilty and\nwas committed for trial at\nthe 'London Sessions. The\ncase should come up some\ntime during the coming year.\nhoped that Piers' Sennet editorship would not be used to\ncondemn him as it was an\nintegral part of London student life.\nCLIVE JENKINS Anyway the fight dragged\nwearily on with a petition\nfrom 24 physics PG's, and\nClive Jenkins lending his\nweight to the IC ASTMS,\nand Digby Jacks NUS president joining in the fun.\nThroughout the summer\nPiers was working in the\nphysics department and trying to ignore the political\nmachinations of IC which\nwas bubbling on apparently\nignorant of the vacation.\nAnyway to cut a long story\nshort the outcome should\nkeep Piers out of union activities for the coming session\nand has started the ball rolling for student and Technical staff acting as a united\nconcern.\nACCOMMODATION SCHEME\nThis year, as last year, Linstead Hall was used as a hotel\nscheme during the summer vacation. The scheme served two\npurposes: to provide cheaper accommodation for students\nstaying in London over the vacation than otherwise available\nand to raise money to be used specifically for providing a new\nhall or student house for Imperial College.\n\n"

Even in the simplified case of our own college, the\nproblem can be taken to almost unlimited depths. How does one allow\nfor technical innovation or the whim of some future group of school-leave rs, neither of which follow well-behaved curves. Thanks to the\nwriters, who in their own way, give valuable pointers as to what IC can\nexpect.\n. . . Rests in the Hands of Those Who Care says H.

It was\nProfessor (now Lord)\nBlackett who I believe\ncoined the title 'Professorial\nBarons' and this labels some\nof those who care for personal reasons. There are\nthose who glory in their subject . . . I have heard a senior Physics Professor say: 'If\nPhysics students have any\nspare time, then they should\nuse it for doing more Physics' . . . and this affects the\ndevelopment of Imperial\nCollege. There are those who\ncare for Imperial College as\npart of their job and the\nresults of their efforts are\nseen in the new buildings.\nRegrettably these are too\nsmall. A size nearer to 20\nstories is needed for each\ntechnology to provide a balance in space between new\nand dying points. The Safe\nLoading Weight for the new\nbuildings is 1 cw t./ square\nfoot and if this is forgotten\nand if the buildings fill up\nwith persons and equipment,\nit could be that one day\nmany of them will fall down.\nIt may be thought that\nthere are only a minority\nwho 'care' but this is not so.\nAll over the College people\nshow that they care by adding personal touches to of fi ces, workshops, stores and\nlabs . . . these are every-where, from the pinned up\ncartoon, that is pertinent to\nsomebody working nearby,\nto the exotic plant, that\nthrives on the central heat-ing. Over the years the hierarchical system in Imperial\nCollege has exerted direct\nand indirect pressure on in-. . . From the Man at the Wheel Lord Penney Felix gave me some holiday homework and\nasked me to write about the future of the College.\nTwo methods are commonly used as an aid to planning for the future. One is to take data from the last\nfew years and project a growth rate. The other is to\nmake a \"market\" survey. Both methods are fallible.\nProjections of total U.K. fuel demand have gone\nawry; and we are all watching to see if Concorde\nwill achieve its predicted market.\n- . . A Past President's View Judith Walker In my opinion, the College has no future as 'Im-peri al College'. Although the name is apt enough,\nsince overseas students are still taught a science\nmore relevant to imperialism than the technological needs of their own countries.\nIf I.C. is to survive as a true institute of higher\neducation it must go out \u2014 towards the nearby\ncommunity, to society at large to the liberation of\nthe Third World. At present the College \u2014 or\nrather the professors and lecturers with private\nconsultancies \u2014 relates very well to the outside\nworld of big business, the milt ary and government,\nbut not so well to its students or to the people. Yet paradoxically the very graduate processed by the\nImperial College system is out of favour vs ith em-ploy ers. A market survey about\nuniversity places would estimate the numbers of school\nstudents each year reaching\npresent university entrance\nstandards. It seems to be\ngenerally agreed that over a decade the numbers might\ndouble. There is little prospect that the number of university places will double\nover ten years\u2014the capital\ncost is too great. Pro rata,\nImperial College could grow\nby more than 300 students\nper year compared with an\naverage of 130 per year over\nDo you want to read books\nby:-Ernest |-Jemingway\nJames y^l d ridge Marghanita Laski\nAlan Qrury\nMargery ^ll ingham Vladimir Klabokov\nGeorge Fliot\nGet them from th he Haldane Library Level 2, Library Block\nOpen Mon. to Fri., 10 \u2014 5.30\nthe last few years. We have\nbeen given general guidance\nto plan for 210 extra each\nyear and sight ly to reduce\nthe proportion of postgraduates. So the College will grow\nsteadily. More interesting,\nperhaps, is whether the College will change from its\nstrong departmental structure with highly specialised\ncourses. In spite of the many\nchanges since I was a stud-ent, the ethos of the College\nhas hardly changed at all.\nThe majority of our students have always wanted a specialised course and have\nbeen willing to work hard\nfor a good degree. They have\nexpected, and usually ob-tai ned, a good job using\ntheir speciality. There is\nnow, I believe, a need to\nbroaden the options, to have\nmore interdisciplinary possibilities at the undergraduate\nlevel, to integrate some of\nour groups (e.g. biology) into Divisions or Institutes,\nwith some common courses\nand also, within the limits\nof our finance, to provide\nmore carefully chosen courses in some fields outside\nscience or technology. We\nmust, I suppose, continue to\nhave the honours degree\nwith its classes for the foreseeable future but we should\nextend the basis on which\nthe assessment is made, in\nthe directions some departments are already moving.\nIf the national economy\ndeteriorates, the resources\navailable to the College will\nbe reduced but these educational changes should go\nahead. The present industrial\nrecession is partly connected\nwith changes in the pecking\norder. The technical society\nin which we live has many\nsensitive spots where pressure\ncan be exerted on the s ys tem. However, the modern\nindustrial state could not sur-vive, with its population\nnumbers and its standards of\nliving, without efficient and\nprogressive technology. I therefore cannot visualise the\ntechnologist and the applied\nscientist losing the influential positions they have to-day. The College will continue to have national im-port ance. Less certain is\nwhether we can fill all our\nplaces with good Students\nwilling to make the effort\nwhich science and technology\ndemand.\nThe next few years will see\nfurther liberalisation for\nstudent participation in central and local College affairs\nbut we must surely avoid the\nextreme positions taken in\nsome other countries, where\nsooner or later academic\nquality is bound to suffer.\nThe most serious College\nproblem where no complete\nsolution is yet in sight is\nStudent accommodation. We\nneed an extra 400 places in\nsix years time. Money given\nto the Appeal will enable\nus to provide at most only\nhalf this number. Apart\nfrom this, the College can\nlook to the future with considerable confidence.\nEDUCATION'S NO PRIVILEGE\nJobless graduates will\nsoon be used as a cudgel by\nthe Tories to 'regretfully'\ncall a halt to expansion in\nhigher education. But elitism\nis no longer acceptable \u2014\neveryone has the right to\ncontinue his or her e duca tion. The degree is no job\npassport, nor should it be.\nEducation is more than\nvocational training on the\ncheap for a job in big bus i ness.\nIC IS KILLING\nSCIENCE\nEducation here should\nmean the teaching of socially\nrelated technology. Science\nis anything but politically\nneutral, so why should it not\nbe turned to the needs of the\npeople? (One good answer\u2014\nbecause capitalism does not\nwork like that!!) Why isn't the College (not just the\nunion) helping the people of\nNotfing Hill\u2014our neigh-b our hood, we have the technology and the people? Be\nwarned\u2014diversification will\ncome to I.C., but there will\nbe no fundamental change\u2014\nno university preaches its\nown destruction.\nYOUR LOCAL\nCOMPREHENSIVE ?\nThe only form of education which could be acceptable as a future would have\nno selection procedures (e.g. the City College of New\nYork), no restricting exams,\nno discrimination. Discrimination?\u2014is that the reason\nwhy there are so few women,\nso few British black Students, and only 30% or so\nworking class students? They\nhave had little chance, oppressed by the capitalist system all along the line, to\nmake it to the citadel.\nI.C. looks down on the\ntechnical colleges yet is itself only a 'high class' ver-sion.\nIn fact, relatively speak-ing, some of I.C.'s courses\nare narrower than at 'lesser'\ninstitutions. The so-called\nBinary system relegates the\ntechnical colleges, colleges of\neducation, and the poly-divi dual s to prevent them\nfrom doing anything about\nthe development of I.C. It is\nonly recently that this pressure has been blocked and\nthe voice of those who care\nabout the people forming\nI.C. Community has become\nstrong.\nThe future of I.C. lies\nwith this latter group since\nthey face up to the basic\nneed of life. Consequently\nassuming this is so, it is\nlikely that in 20 years time,\nI.C. will start to be completely rebuilt as an interdisciplinary college with no\nclear separate departments\nand centred around a central\ncomputer complex. At some\npoint in time before then,\nthere will be a massive\nchange in environmental\nconditions which will include re-designing the open\nspaces, making the whole\nprecinct a pedestrian only\narea with vastly improved\ncultural and recreational\nfacilities, and cleaning the\nair of the city pollutants . . .\ntechnic s( still) to a second\nclass status, with much less\nmoney for many more stud-ents, often crowded into older buildings.\nEqual opportunity for all\nmeans an end to the iniquitous binary division\nwhich keeps the majority of\nstudents (in non-university\ncolleges) down.\nIC NO:\nUSK YES:\nUSK, the student-inspired\n'University of South Kensington', could be the model\nfor the future\u2014the bringing\ntogether of all the institutes\nin Kensington. These first\nSteps towards uniting the\nstudents have, however, been\ntaken by the Unions and not\nthe College authorities. The\ncomprehensive university is\na logical step, which will\nhave to be fought hard for.\nIt's students may Study full\nor part time, but in either\ncase they should receive a wage rather than a grant.\n'The student wage assumes\nthat higher education is producing an economically\ndesirable output i.e. the\neconomy needs you. 'The\nloan sees higher education as\na personal consumer good'.\nStudent unions are becoming more like trade unions\nand in industry the white\ncollar workers (i.e. you, the\ntechnocrat) union is e. How can the future be\nchanged and I.C. destroyed/\nreconstructed? The college\nwill not dissolve the department structure, be governed\nby a general assembly and\nbecome a community college\nby sweet reason. And repressive tolerance is a British\nbyword\u2014despite the present\ngovernment. Think and act.\nThe future lies the way of\nLennon, Jackson, Freedom\nbrothers.\n\n"
