However,\nthere is currently a\nsubclass of people who wish\nto take this from us, and in fact\nthey try every few decades or\nso. No, I\u2019m not talking about\nthe Jews for once, but instead\nthe problem is the uncle tom\u2019s of\nthe white educated liberals. The\nworst culprits are of course the\nwomen who apparently go to\nuniversities now. The other day\nwhen I was in Starbucks (because\nyou must always support Israel)\nand some unemployed artist told\nme that I had misgendered her.\nI\u2019m sorry, but are you a woman?\nThen you are a woman. Are you\npaid consistently less than your\nmale counterparts? Then you are\na woman. I threw the coffee in\nher face and told her to check her\nprivilege. After that encounter I\nleft and went to collect my dry\ncleaning; however, this landwhale\nin front of me was moving at a rate\nslower than the investigation into\nthe disappearance of Madeleine\nMcCann.\nI hence addressed the fact that\nthis human-elephant hybrid was\ntaking up the entire pavement by\naddressing it in whale song and\npromptly telling them to move\ntheir obese excuse for a body. In\nresponse to my polite ejaculation,\nthe fatty started to make incoherent noises towards me \u2013 it\u2019s mouth\nwas obviously full of biscuits so\nI can\u2019t say for certain \u2013 but I\u2019m\nfairly sure it tried to insinuate that\nI shouldn\u2019t fat shame. Now this\nis a term that really gets into my\nurethra. If you\u2019re fat, don\u2019t try and\nmake me feel bad for the fact you\ncan\u2019t stop shoving ice cream down\nyour gullet. I made my feelings\nclear to it, but instead it threw its\ndiet coke can at me and started to\nchase me before realizing that it\nwould be too exhausting an action\nto walk a few metres for its weak\nframe to handle.\nAfter that was done, I could\nfinally complete my art project that\nI have recently just started, under\nthe guise of being into multicultur-alism. After a poor experience on\ngoing to Golders Green and finding no gold whatsoever, I thought I\nshould alert other people as to the\ntrue contents of this borough. I also\nhave made sure that people are\naware of fat old women, a trifecta\nof awful people that you should\nhope to avoid.\nF\nreedom is this week\u2019s\ntheme for the last outpost\nof liberalism and free\nspeech that is felix.\nLuckily last week the\nartist formally known\nas Jonathan Masters lost the\nelection in order to become head\nself-congratulator \u2013 also known\nas \u2018editor\u2019 \u2013 and hence balance\nhas been restored to the universe.\nI hear that he is now putting up\n\u2018beware of the Jew\u2019 signs in north\nLondon as an ironic joke. Sounds\nhilarious. As a plus, we are now\nvery close to the end of lent, and\nwhilst I only subscribe to religions\nfrom South-East Asia, I found\nit an extremely opportune time\nto give up some of my vices. A\ncommon gripe that many of the\nheathens have against vegans\nis that we express the truth too\noften, which may push us towards\nbeing somewhat abrasive. As a\nresult I spent the past month and\na bit trying to restrain myself from\ntelling anyone I was a vegan\nunnecessarily and I AM ALMOST\nAT FUCKING BURSTING POINT.\n*Deep breath*\nAnyway back to my favourite\nsubject: freedom. Obviously it is\ntenet of modern western civilisations that there is no oppression of\nany kind towards any individuals;\nhowever, this does not seem to\nstretch towards anim\u2013 wait. I\nstopped myself. Um what\u2019s another\nissue I can piggyback onto? Well\nI guess we should have freedom\nto be whatever gender (from a\nchoice of 36) we want to be as\nlong as anim\u2013 ok look I just want\nlent to fucking end so I can talk\nabout animals again. During this\nperiod of strife and woe I went to\nsee Moonlight again, just to rub\nit in the faces of all white people\neverywhere that felt joy over Ryan\nGosling saving jazz. Here\u2019s one\nthing I want to discuss in order\nto get my mind off animals of all\npersuasions: have you ever seen\na handjob scene in a movie that\nwasn\u2019t awkward to watch? There\nare three handjob scenes I can\nthink of: the pilot episode of Breaking Bad, Brokeback Mountain, and\nobviously Moonlight. I just don\u2019t\nget it though \u2013 why has nobody\nmade an arousing/not-uncomfort-able handjob scene yet? If you\ncan think of any please send them\nin. It\u2019s just like two actors ruffling\naround each other\u2019s clothes for a\nfew minutes. Maybe the solution\nwould be if they had like a stunt\npenis so that it looked more realis-tic. Or at least like a cumshot that\nlands directly onto the camera.\nPlease don\u2019t steal my ideas.\nI\u2019m doing lent so can\u2019t\ntalk about animals but\ncan we address movie\nhandjobs for a sec?\nJonathan Masters\u2019 has an idea\nthat will revolutionise cinema\nAre white liberals\neverywhere\nnowadays or is it\nmy neighbourhood?\nMonathan Jasters can\u2019t seem to\nbe able to go anywhere without\nbumping into/against annoying\nliberals v\nS\nV\n* Sponsored by\nStarbucks\n\n"

Of course,\nI\u2019m not referring to France\n(their love of cheese is not\nunusual \u2013 just deal with it) or\nother travel destinations, but\nI\u2019m trying to make a tenuous\nlink with fucking in weird\nplaces. So, take a break from\nrevision and prepare to be\nentertained.\nLet\u2019s start with the basics:\nAgoraphilia. The term refers\nto a wide range of practices\nor fantasies which involve sex\noutdoors, sex in wide-open\nspaces and sex in public\nplaces. The motivations for\nthis can be as simple as wanting to try something novel,\nbut sometimes involve much\nB.C. Maile\ncan certainly give a sense of\nliberation and excitement. But\nbreaking the standard rules\nof where you can and can\u2019t\nhave sex also feeds into that\nstandard sexual mentality of\nlosing inhibitions. If you grew\nup in the countryside, you\u2019ve\nprobably had an outdoor\nencounter at a drunken camp-out. But if you\u2019re more of a\ntown mouse, why not have\na trip out of London, find a\nquiet forest and give it a go?\nAlternatively, you could take\nit one step further and have\na go at dogging. Most of you\nare probably familiar with\nthe lingo, but \u2018dogging\u2019 is a\nsex, although there is some\ncrossover. The exhibitionists\nsometimes enjoy sex as an\nact of performance, or enjoy\nthe feeling of letting go and\ngoing primal, without having\nto worry about observers. For\nothers, there\u2019s a humiliation\naspect to the fetish, in being\npublicly dominated. Unfortunately for doggers, dogging\nis illegal, and sex in public\ncan carry a hefty fine.\nIf you don\u2019t fancy taking\nthat risk but still want to have\nsex in public, some beaches\nare sex-friendly. It\u2019s worth\nnoting though, that most\nnudist beaches have a fairly\nstraight, public sex might be\na bit more difficult to get, but\nthere are still options. There\nare a fair few straight swingers clubs around London \u2013 a\nfew of them quite kinky. A\nquick online search (try Fetlife\nor just plain ol\u2019 Google)\nshould yield some good testi-monials. If you\u2019re a girl, you\u2019ll\npotentially getting found\nout and the accompanying\nfeeling of naughtiness are\nmajor drivers. That\u2019s why\nsome of you will go for\nslightly cleaner spaces, such\nas various lecture theatres,\nQueen\u2019s Tower or the library\n(you know who you are). But\nstill, grime can be part of the\nthrill, which is why, time and\ntime again, some of you\u2019ll\ngo for the grossness which\naccompanies public showers,\ntoilets and Metric. That very\nliteral feeling of dirtiness\nadds a new layer of taboo\nbreaking to the experience,\non top of the getting-caught-with-your pants-down factor.\nWhilst it\u2019s not for everyone,\nthe sport has many followers.\nThere is a lot of erotic media\nrevolving around this type of\npublic sex, and it has become\nsuch a cultural phenomenon\nthere is even a law in the UK\nspecifically prohibiting sex in\npublic bathrooms. So if you\u2019re\ngoing to try it, be very careful\nyou don\u2019t get caught.\nRegardless of whether it\u2019s\nthe great outdoors, showing\noff in public, the risk of being\ndisturbed or getting down in\ndirty places that floats your\nboat, embrace it. If you\u2019re\nfeeling confused or shocked\nby this article, or even if\nyou\u2019re plain-old bored, I hope\nyou at least feel inquisitive\nenough to take advantage of\nthe break and try something\nnew. Just be careful, and\nremember to always check\nfor cameras.\n\\\\ The motivations\nfor this can be as\nsimple as wanting\nto try something\nnovel, but sometimes\ninvolve much more\ncomplex desires \\\\\nmore complex desires. One\nof the main spheres of motivation for agoraphilia seems\nto be based around the openness of the space. Being able\nto see sky or distances larger\nthan a standard bedroom\nBritish colloquial term given\nto the practice of having sex\nin public, usually a car-park\nor field, while others watch.\nSome practitioners get off\non having people see them\nfucking, some get off on\nseeing others fucking. The\nmotivations behind this are\nsomewhat different from\njust being into outdoor\nstrict no-sex policy. If you\ndon\u2019t mind being indoors,\nthere is still a multitude of sex\nand swingers\u2019 clubs around\nLondon. If you\u2019re gay, you\u2019re\nin luck. London is full of gay\nsaunas where sex is allowed\nand encouraged. There are\nalso a hell of a lot of gay sex\nand kink clubs around, just a\nmouse-click away. If you\u2019re\n\\\\ If you\u2019ve ever\nheard these stories\nand asked yourself\nwhy people would\nwant to fuck in a\nBlackett basement\nshower with the stink\nof a half-clogged\ndrain filling their\nnostrils \u2013 well, let me\nexplain \\\\\nget into most of them for a dis-count, if not for free. If you\u2019re\na guy, you\u2019ll be paying a fair\nbit more. #patriarchy\nThough, such spaces can\ntake away part of the appeal.\nFor many, it\u2019s really about\nthe thrill of nearly getting\ncaught. I\u2019m sure most of you\nhave heard stories of people\nhaving sex on campus (and\nthere are, indeed, several\ndecent spots). If you\u2019ve ever\nheard these stories and asked\nyourself why people would\nwant to fuck in a Blackett\nbasement shower with the\nstink of a half-clogged drain\nfilling their nostrils \u2013 well, let\nme explain.\nWe\u2019ve established that\nI\u2019m...

The\nAmerican Dream: pop to the\npresent is as ambitious as it\nis controversial, with critics\nquestioning not only pop art\u2019s\nartistic value, but moreover\nwhether it belongs in the\nBritish Museum at all.\nThe exhibition, however,\naims to prove that printmaking was a key technique\nthrough which artists tackled\nthe changing social and\npolitical dynamics occurring\nduring their lifetimes. By\npresenting different artists\ncoveted 'American dream'\nas an illusion. By using\nscreenprinting techniques, for\nexample, these artists blur\nthe lines between commercial\nand fine art.\nMany works are of giant\nscale, reflecting the notion\npropagated by consumerism that 'bigger is better'.\nSimilarly, a recurring theme\nbetween different artists is the\ndisplay of common everyday\nobjects. By displaying these\nobjects as icons, the artists\nridicule the idealisation of,\nand obsession with, the\nstereotypical American way\nof life, which dominated mass\nadvertising and bordered on\na social cult.\nThe exhibition also allows us\nto learn about the printmaking process itself, spotlighting\ninnovative techniques that\nwere experimented with by\npioneer artists of the 1960s\nand 70s. Some surprising\nmethods include Ed Ruscha\u2019s\nuse of gunpowder to achieve\ngrey notes, and dropping\nlithographic ink onto stone\nto give the illusion of liquid\nletters, as well as Donald\nSultan\u2019s aquatint, which\nreplicates charcoal drawings.\nCommon also are techniques\nof exhaustive reproduction \u2013 collaging, layering,\nproducing, and reproducing,\nover and over again. These\nprocesses appear to mirror\nthose associated with mass\nproduction, exposing how\nsuch a means of production\nrids objects of their value.\nThe British Museum is home\nto many artefacts of lost\ncivilizations, and one can\nargue that some of the works\nin this show belong to that col-lection, as relics of America\u2019s\nlost glory days \u2013 the tattered\nAmerican flags of Jasper\nJohns\u2019 Flags 1, for example,\nor Robert Rauschenberg\u2019s\npieces that reference the\nspace race.\nThe contrast between New\nYork and Los Angeles artists,\nas highlighted in one of the\nrooms, is quite unexpected.\nWorks of LA artists make\nstatements pertinent to the\n'LA lifestyle' and the world of\nleisure with recurring motifs\nof palm trees, sunlit boule-vards, Hollywood, desert\nlandscapes, and light blue\npools. The objects associated\nwith leisure in these artworks\nseem to radiate the still hot\nLA air, and, paradoxically, a\nfeeling of dead, uninhabited\nemptiness.\nWorth noting as well is the\nimportance of words and\nphrases in contemporary\nAmerican printmaking \u2013 a\nsubject which is unique to\nthis art form.

Andy Warhol\u2019s quote opens the show,\nalongside a giant American\nflag made of neon lights, and\nthese set the mood for the\nexhibition: the idea that printmaking exposed this 'fantasy\nAmerica', which had been\naccepted and endorsed by\nsociety, resonates throughout\nthe show.\nIn the first room, one\ninstantly recognizes iconic\nworks by pop artists such\nas Andy Warhol and Roy\nLichtenstein. It\u2019s remarkable\nhow cleverly and clearly their\nworks make statements about\nAmerican consumerism and\nmass media, revealing the\n\\\\ The show\nproves that\nprintmaking is not\nonly a prominent\nart form, but is\nalso a versatile\ntechnique full\nof endless\npossibilities \\\\\nshow by artists such as Mel\nBochner, Ed Ruscha, and\nBruce Nauman display either\nsingle words or every-day\nclich\u00e9s, giving them an\nironic tone that is enduringly\nthought-provoking.\nOverall, the British\nMuseum\u2019s show proves that\nprintmaking is not only a\nprominent art form, but is\nalso a versatile technique\nfull of endless possibilities; a\nmedium that one can make\none\u2019s own. This inclusive\nart form is open to all as a\npowerful means of expressing\none\u2019s voice and beliefs.\nThese aspects not only justify\nprintmaking\u2019s artistic merit\nand historical relevance, but\nmoreover \u2013 with the aura\nof general discontent with\ncurrent political and social\nissues that seems to permeate\nthrough today\u2019s world \u2013 printmaking seems as relevant in\nour age as ever.\n\\\\ The works\nmake statements\nabout American\nconsumerism and\nmass media \\\\\nC\nlassical dance\nis about\nconfirmation,\nwhile\ncontemporary\ndance is about\nexploration.\u201d Classical ballets\nare drawn from well-known\ntales; the characters fall\ninto easily recognisable\nroles \u2013 the princess, the\nknight-errant, the evil queen.\nBy the end of the first act,\nif not before, we all know\nhow the story ends. Good\ntriumphs over evil, the star-crossed lovers are tragically\nseparated by fate, and so on.\nEven the language of ballet\ndisplays itself in conventional\nfigures such as grand jet\u00e9s\nand pirouettes. On the\nother hand, contemporary\ndance is characterised by\nfreedom and creativity of\nmovement, with a focus\non expressiveness \u2013 unlike\nclassical dance, there is often\nno narrative story and the\nabstract meaning of a piece\nis left up to the viewer to\ndecide.\nPersonally, I find the neb-ulous-ness of contemporary\ndance a bit confusing. It was\nthus, with some trepidation,\nthat I attended Returning/To\nBe Me, a double bill which is\nLiverpudlian Julie Cunningham\u2019s choreography debut at\nthe Barbican. After a successful career as a dancer,\nincluding a decade\nwith Merce Cunningham \u2013 one of\nthe forerunners\nof American\nmodern dance\n\u2013 she is trying\nher hand at\nchoreography with her\nown dance\ncompany,\nconsisting of\njust three other\ndancers and\nherself.\nGender fluidity\nand identity is the\ntheme of the evening.\nThe first piece, Returning, is\nset to an eclectic soundtrack\nof Anohni, Bj\u00f6rk, and Ravel.\nDressed in deliberately\nandrogynous costumes, the\nfour dancers group and\nungroup in fluid movements.\nThe Barbican Centre\u2019s Pit,\na tiny 200-seat theatre, is\nso small that we hear every\nJulie Cunningham | Dance as\nPerformance\nArt\nClaire Chan\nJulie Cunningham & Company's\nDoubleBillwasonattheBarbican\nCentre from 8th\n\u2013 11th\nMarch\nJulie Cunningham & Company, Double Bill, Harry Alexander, Julie Cunningham, Alexander Williams and\nHannah Burfield in Returning \\\\ Stephen Wrigh\nreciting five poems from her\ncollection Hold Your Own.\nThe poems are based loosely\non Tiresias, the gender-chang-ing prophet of Greek legend.\nTempest is known for her\nspoken-word poetry that\ndraws from rap and hip-hop\ninfluences, and her wild voice\nprovides a perfect backdrop\nfor the starker, more forceful\nchoreography of To Be Me.\nCompared to the shifting fluidity of Returning, this second\npiece is moodier, darker, with\nthemes of internal conflict and\nexternal struggle.\nCunningham\u2019s classical\ntraining is evident in her\nmeticulous choreography.\nWhile it retains the formalism\nand structure of classical\nballet, it uses it in a highly\nexplorative, experimental\nway. The four dancers fill the\nperformance space and the\nchoreography is never boring\nor monotonous to watch.\nPurely from a dance\nperspective, I don\u2019t think\nI liked it that much \u2013 Cunningham\u2019s choreography\nis certainly solid but it is\nnot very accessible. One\nenigmatic configuration of\nfigures morphs to another\nwith impassioned staring\nand quasi-symbolic gestures,\nbut a coherence within each\npiece is somewhat lacking\nand the inherent meaning\n(is there meant to be one?)\nremains elusive. In 1903,\nIsadora Duncan proposed\nthat for the dancer of\nthe future, \u201cthe natural\nlanguage of the soul\nwill have become\nthe movement of the\nbody\u201d. Perhaps it is\njust me, but I don\u2019t\nthink contemporary\ndance is quite there\nyet. Combined with\nthe poetry and music,\nhowever, Cunningham\u2019s choreography\ndoes make an interesting piece of performance\nart. Thought-provoking,\neven if the theme of gender\nstarts to feel a little overdone\nby the end.\n\\\\ Cunningham\u2019s\nclassical training\nis evident in\nher meticulous\nchoreography \\\\\nsqueak of their bare feet on\nthe floor; it feels curiously inti-mate. The dancers\u2019 motions\nare informed not only by the\nrhythm of the music but also\nby spoken words that overlie\nthe soundtrack; we hear a\nmonologue that muses on the\npull of the moon, menstrua-tion, and the gendered nature\nof monotheistic gods.\nTo Be Me is set to the turbulent voice of Kate Tempest\nJulie Cunningham & Company, Double Bill, Alexander\nWilliams, Hannah Burfield, Harry Alexander and Julie\nCunningham in To Be Me \\\\ Stephen Wrigh\n\n"

It was a long\nwait for the computers to get\nrunning properly for CS:GO\nbut once they were up and\nrunning, the games began.\nThe Imperial team were\nactually able to hold their\nground and were consistently\nF\nor most people, the\n12th\nof March was just\nanother Sunday. For\na group of certain\nindividuals, however,\nit was a chance for\nlasting and eternal glory.\nWell, more like temporary\nhappiness for a few days, but\nhey, we all have to take what\nat Meltdown, a well known\neSports bar in London, which\nconveniently has all the setup\nand equipment needed for\na big tournament. Despite\nthe small scale nature of the\nevent, at least 80 people\nshowed up, either to compete\nor cheer their friends on.\nBefore the games could\nbegin however, there were a\nmultitude of server and other\ntechnical issues that needed\naddressing. If you try and\norganise any games tourna-ment, that\u2019s just a given thing\nyou need to deal with. It took\na while but they were finally\nsorted out and the games\ncould begin, albeit slightly\ndelayed.\nThe games played were\nStarcraft, Hearthstone,\nDefence of the Ancients,\nCounter-Strike and League\nof Legends. The overall gist\nwas that the University that\nwon the most games would\nbe crowned the victor. Simple\nenough, and Imperial College\nwas able to win the Starcraft\nmatch with relative ease\n(dat library broadband). It\nseemed as though the DOTA\nmatch would follow suit as\nImperial were able to achieve\nan impressive win for the first\nmatch. However, their streak\ndidn\u2019t last for DOTA and UCL\nwere able to inch ahead and\nwin the DOTA game.\nHearthstone was next, a\nfreemium and highly addictive\nonline card game that anyone\ncan play. This time the match\nwas very, very close and it\nwent all the way down to the\nlast game where, unfortunately for us, UCL were able\nto steal the victory.\nAs the day gave way to the\nnight, things started looking\ngrim for Imperial; UCL had\nahead of UCL; in fact they\nwon the first set of matches.\nIn the second set, UCL started\nto gain the upper hand but\nImperial refused to go down\nand were able to get in some\nwins. Eventually, even though\nUCL won the second match,\nImperial managed to snatch\nenough victories overall that,\nto everyone\u2019s surprise they\nwere declared the victors of\nthe Counter-Strike varsity.\nAlmost poetically, it came\ndown to a classic game,\nLeague of Legends, to determine the ultimate winner of\nthe tournament. Things had\nto be set up quickly as it\nwas late in the night by then\nand Meltdown was to close\nin a few hours. The League\nmatches began with intense\naction right from the start and\noverhead commentary added\nto the mood and atmosphere.\nIt was brutal and tense but\neventually, the Imperial team\nwere able to plough ahead\nand win the match, and\nthe tournament. So we are\nliterally better than UCL. Fuck\nyou QS rankings.\nBut are we though? According to reports, the UCL team\nhad technical issues with their\nheadsets so they couldn\u2019t\nproperly communicate and\nwork together. In light of\nthis, a rematch of League of\nLegends will be held for fun\non the 8th\nof April, which you\ncan live stream from Imperial Esports\u2019 twitch stream\naccount. So look out for that\nfor that final confrontation.\nOverall, the tournament\nwas a massive success and a\ngreat way of bringing people\ntogether for games, drinks\nand banter. Another one\nis planned for next year so\nhopefully this will become a\nregular thing and get bigger\nand better with each repeat.\neSports | Imperial vs UCL\n\\\\ Almost poetically,\nit came down to\na classic game of\nLeague of Legends\nto determine the\nultimate winner \\\\\nwe can get.\nThis Sunday, an eSports\ntournament was held between\ntalented players from Imperial College and UCL. Five\ngames, two universities but\nonly one trophy to be claimed\nby the ultimate winner. The\ntrophy was big enough that I\ncould hold it in the palm of my\nhand; a clear indication of the\nfact that the organisers went\nall out on this tournament.\nSpeaking of organisers, this\ntournament wasn\u2019t organised\nby any large groups like\nVarsity Games, but rather by\nthe eSports societies of both\nuniversities. It was also held\nGotta get that APM (actions per minute you noob!) just right \\\\ Saad Ahmed\nA final round of congratulations should go to both the\neSports societies and the\nplayers for their efforts and\nvictories.\nGangsta riot |\nYakuza 0\nTalk to the racecar, the face ain\u2019t listening\n\\\\ Sega\nQasim Mahmood\nT\nhe Yakuza games\nhave always been\nimmensely popular\nin Japan, so much\nso that their central\nprotagonist, Kiryu\nKazuma, is considered\na mascot of PlayStation.\nHowever, they unfortunately\nhave never found their footing\nhere in the West and are\nlargely unheard of. If, like\nme, you have never played a\nYakuza game before, please\nright that wrong by playing\nthis game.\nYakuza 0 is a tale centred\naround two protagonists\nand acts as a prequel to\nthe other games. Kazuma\nKiryu, the protagonist of the\nentire franchise, is a brash\nand na\u00efve young man who\nrecently joined the yakuza.\nIn a simple money collection\nmission gone wrong, he is\nframed for murder and ends\nup embroiled in a massive turf\nwar between parties that seek\nto take over Tokyo. Meanwhile, Goro Majima, another\nmainstay in the franchise, is\na one-eyed ex-Yakuza living\nin Osaka as the manager\nof a cabaret, as punishment\nfor a crime he committed.\nTo gain favour with his boss,\nhe agrees to assassinate a\nperson named Makoto Makimura, though his life takes\nslow but powerful Beast style.\nMajima on the other hand,\nhas his typical Thug style, a\nbreak dancing Breaker style\nas well as a bat-wielding Slugger style. Each style for each\ncharacter shines in specific\ncircumstances; for instance,\nKiryu\u2019s Rush style is great\nfor taking on certain large\nenemies by darting in, dealing a few hits, then darting\nout; while Majima\u2019s Breaker\nstyle in incredibly good for\ntaking on and demolishing\nlarge crowds of people. There\nare no experience points,\nas everything in the game\nrevolves around a single cur-rency: Yen. The same money\nthat you use for buying items\nand everything else is also\nused for upgrading your skills\nand abilities, which leads to\ninteresting decisions about\nwhich abilities to upgrade\nearly in the game. However,\nsoon the money begins flowing in, making most decisions\ntrivial.\nHowever, playing through\nthe story is just scratching the\nsurface of Yakuza 0. The side\nmissions are among the best\nparts of the game, though\nthey will initially throw players for a loop. This is because\nthere exists a massive tonal\nchange between the main\nstory and substories; you\ncan go from an incredibly\nemotional scene involving a\nsurprising reveal to a wacky\nsubstory within minutes. One\nof my favourites involves a\nperson you meet in a dark\na sharp turn when he finds\nhimself unable and unwilling\nto do so.\nThese stories are gripping\nand extremely well told,\ndespite some melodrama.\nHowever, this is easily overlooked as the performances\n\\\\ Everything in\nthe game revolves\naround a single\ncurrency: Yen \\\\\nJust stand tall and look badass \\\\ Sega\nYakuza 0 is out on the\nPlaystation 4\nare phenomenal; the voice\nacting, completely in Japanese, is incredibly good and\nis able to sell the weaker\nparts of the story. There\nare instances of surprising\nemotional depth; for instance,\nmy sister came in to watch a\nsection of the game for the\nfirst time just as an important\ncutscene was playing. Fifteen\nminute later, she was in tears\nand completely hooked. The\ngame benefits greatly from\nfocusing exclusively on the\nplights of Kiryu and Majima,\nwith the paths of both protagonists ultimately converging.\nThe gameplay is simple,\nand the beat-\u2018em-up combat\nis brutal yet fun. Each protagonist has three distinct\nfighting styles, which can\nbe switched on the fly and\ncan be upgraded individu-ally. Kiryu has his standard\nBrawler style, a quick and\nnimble Rush style as well as a\n\\\\ Playing through\nthe story is just\nstratching the\nsurface of Yakuza\n0 \\\\\nalley selling mushrooms. You\nassume he is selling magic\nmushrooms but he is in fact\njust selling normal mush-rooms. Whenever you visit\nhim, he is constantly being\naccosted by yakuza who want\nmagic mushrooms, much to\nhis bewilderment. Another of\nmy favourites tasks you with\nhelping an American popstar\ncalled \u2018Miracle Johnson\u2019\nshoot a music video involving\nzombies, while in yet another\nyou stand in as a producer for\na TV advert. These substories\nare incredibly entertaining\nand once you accept the wild-ness, you are in for a massive\ntreat as they provide the most\namusing parts of the entire\ngame.\nYakuza 0 is truly amaz-ing, and with the release of\nYakuza Kiwami, the remake\nof the first game, soon, there\nhas been no better time to\njump into this franchise. This\nis a great entry point and\nit proves that even with an\ninconsistent tone, a game can\ndeliver a fantastic experience.\nYou owe it to yourself to give\nYakuza 0 a try, as it is one of\nthe best games this year.\n\n"

Fortified by a\ncocktail of stimulants, I still felt\nlacking in brass for my foray\nbehind enemy lines. Twentyone and male, I had been\ndoubly inoculated from the\nmysterious world of weddings.\nMy only experiences were\nthe odd episode of Bridezilla\nor Cake Boss, highlight reels\nof caricatures resplendent in\neditor\u2019s face, and pulled by\nthe allure of the promised\nfree champagne, I adopted a\nregal expression \u2013 \u201cThey\u2019re\nexpecting me inside, would\nyou like me to call the press\noffice?\u201d\n\u201cJust go on in, mate,\u201d he\nsaid, already disinterested\nand turning away.\nEcstatic with my success, I\ngrinned to myself as I listed\nall the events I could bluff my\nway into with a laminated\npass and a firm handshake.\nA whole world of free events\nand alcohol lay ahead. Then\nI recalled I was about to walk\ninto the National Wedding\nShow and my mood came\ncrashing back down.\nI navigated my way to the\npress office and secured my\nofficial laminated press pass.\nI began pinning it to my shirt.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t need to actually\nwear it, love,\u201d smiled the\ncoquettish girl on the desk.\nI blushed as I fumbled with\nthe pin and it fell to the floor,\nany illusion of professionalism\nirreparably shattered. Her\nsmile widened as she bent to\npick it up and kindly fixed it in\nplace for me. I mumbled some\nthanks, before fleeing the\nscene to begin my first circuit\nof the stalls.\nI snaked my way around\nthe centre: an orgy of ivory,\nhere both as a vendor and\nwith fianc\u00e9 in tow. She said\nshe\u2019d been to over 180 wed-dings, yet couldn\u2019t possibly\nplan her own.

I was\naccosted by the vendor\n\u2013 \u201cYou missed all of the\nbeautiful models come in at\ntwelve,\u201d he leered and began\nhis spiel.

Disappointed in\nmyself for succumbing to such\nheteronormative marketing,\nI started towards the shoes.\nMade vulnerable by the glorious footwear, I was assaulted\nby the salesman\u2019s pitch there\ntoo and handed what felt like\nmy fiftieth business card of\nthe day. I disengaged and\npointedly emptied my pockets\nof business cards in the bin a\nmetre away. Satisfied with my\ndisplay of passive aggression,\nI decided I\u2019d seen enough\nof weddings.

And so\nbe it, let there be bliss with\nsuch oblivion. As stated in\nmy previous article, there\u2019s\nnothing wrong with letting\ngo and just meditating on\nthe smells and complexity of\nfood. It\u2019s true that curiosity\nkilled the cat, but we\u2019re at\nImperial, and we want to\nknow things, right?\nCooking bends the world to\nour will. I\u2019m not a good cook,\nbut I do love to bake, and call\nme what you will, but there\ndoes exist some fine overlap\nbetween the two. Each\nweekend I never set out to\nattain the acme of nutritional\nperfection with my experi-ments, all I know is that I tend\nto vacillate between wanting\nthe simple and complex.\nWhy talk about just flavour\nwhen you can understand the\nnutritional complexity behind\neach daring ingredient combi-nation, and why some always\nwork?\nIt\u2019s not wrong to try and\njustify whatever pre or misconception you have about\nany fruit-based dessert. Heck,\nit\u2019s not so wrong to appreciate the little bit of health\nstuffed into a dessert without\nany fruit, anyway. Pears are\nactually also incredibly high\nin quercetin, known to boost\noverall brain health and\nmemory, with a recent study\nin Sciencedaily showing it\ncould be part of the ideal diet\nto treat and reverse diabetes,\nas well as diabetes-induced\nhypertension. Naturally\noccurring phenolic compounds found in fruits may\nprovide a variety of health\nbenefits, though don\u2019t you\ndare throw away that peel,\nfor its varied and higher phenolic content is found in the\nskin of the pear rather than in\nthe flesh or pulp. Anyway, the\nstudy showed that Starkrimson (a pear species) peel had\nthe highest total phenolic con-tent, and that peel extracts\nhad significantly higher total\nphenolic content than pulp.\nWhat else could possibly\nhave quercetin?\nChocolate. Of course choc-olate, dark and nothing more\npretentious than that, bears\nall the goods. In my recipe\nfor this clafoutis, pockets of\nchocolate are packed in moist\nflesh. Once out of the oven,\nthe oozing and seeping is\nmagnificent, luscious dark\nrivers seeping into surrounding holes and crevices.\nChocolate has plenty, chocolate is lush. No, eating this\ndessert won\u2019t immediately\nimprove your brain function\nby reducing oxidative stress\nand inflammation. Eating a\npear alone, not baked and\noverly sweetened alongside\nall the hoo-ha, will obviously\nbe better. Chocolate and\npear is a classic mash-up, and\nthe additional banana here\nadds a moist, sweet dimension without being too easily\ndetected. The banana thing\nwas unintentional by the way;\nI just have a tendency to substitute banana for egg when\nI run out of the latter. Not\nthat the sweet and familiar\nflavour doesn\u2019t pair well, but\nthe mildest hint enhances and\ndoesn\u2019t shadow the two stars.\nThe clafoutis itself retained\na lovely almost pudding-like\nconsistency in the middle,\nflying the flan flag high and\nbright. Served with the simple\nintegrity of vanilla ice cream,\nthis is the perfect breakfast,\ndessert, or in-betweener.\nAll that said, just knowing\nabout what\u2019s in your food\nmakes you feel like you\u2019re\neating something special,\nhoning your experience and\nappreciation of the plate. Try\npairing your next pear with\nsome chocolate for a more\nrounded snack satiation and\ndouble the dose of flavonoids\nlike quercetin. Sadly, I can\u2019t\nsay much about the ice\ncream.\n\\\\ Pears are\nnaturally high in\nquercetin, known\nto boost overall\nbrain health and\nmemory \\\\\n\\\\ Naturally\noccuring phenolic\ncompounds found\nin fruits provide a\nvariety of health\nbenefits \\\\\n\n"

Some coped by\ncampaigning online, thereby\nretreating safely behind a\nFacebook page or Twitter\naccount dedicated to their\nglory, but most of us ended\nup doing the face to face\ncampaign. And it was an\ninteresting experience, so I\nchose to write it down for your\nconvenience. This way you can\nfeel the thrill of the elections\nwithout actually standing for\nanything, or even voting. Isn\u2019t\nthat great?\nThe first step happens before\ncampaigning: choosing what\nyou stand for. Not in the \u201cI\nhave values\u201d kind of way, but\nin the \u201cI have ambition\u201d kind\nof way. You won\u2019t get elected\nif you stand for everything, so\nthink hard about the position\n\\\\ You need to\nconvey just the right\namount of outrage\nto seem bold, but\nnot too much or\nyou will sound petty\nand short-tempered\n(#Corbyn) \\\\\nyou aim for. Next year\u2019s\n#Medictatorship is a perfect\nexample, with three out of\nfive sabbs hailing from the\ndepartment of medicine after\nChippy Compton-scattered\nany serious candidates across\nall the positions. This way,\ninstead of having to compete\nagainst each other, they\ncruised peacefully to victory\nalmost unopposed, in one of\nthe most boring elections in\nrecent memory. So choose\nsomething just slightly above\nwhat you are currently doing,\nlike dep rep from year rep,\nor CU president from CU\nofficer. The Union sends you\nan email suggesting what\nyou can stand for, but I feel\ntheir targeting is a bit off, as\nthey suggested I stand for\nan undergrad position (I\u2019m a\npostgrad) and DP Education (I\nlike my course).\nThe next step is writing your\nmanifesto. Here, you need to\nconvey just the right amount\nof outrage to seem bold, but\nnot too much or you will sound\npetty and short-tempered\n(#Corbyn). Be sure to highlight\nyour current experience,\nwhile remaining silent on how\ngrossly you underperformed\nin carrying out your own\nexpectations. You still\nprobably did more than the\nperson before you though, so\ndon\u2019t feel ashamed of listing\nyour triumphs, no matter how\nsmall. Add a few promises\nwhere you extrapolate what\nyou feel is lacking and must be\nfixed to the whole college, and\nvoil\u00e0! Manifesto magnifico.\nBut a manifesto is only the\nsecond most important part\nof your election profile. The\npicture is where you need\nyour A-game. Use one that\nis slightly better looking than\nyou are, but not so much\nthat you wouldn\u2019t recognise\nyourself. Avoid adding extra\nstuff in Photoshop unless you\nare Fred Fyles, in which case\ngo full Soviet imagery on us,\nsince felix is a Lef-tist bastion.\nOutdoor backgrounds are\ngood, since they tell people\nviewing the picture that you\nhave interests beyond the food\nat Fusion. You can also add\na PDF with more campaign\npromises or posters, but\nnobody is going to actually\nread it, so the image is really\nthe only visual stimulation\nvoters will get.\nAll this needs to happen\nbefore you can start\ncampaigning. You then have\ntwo weeks ahead of you to\nrack in more votes than your\nopponents, or congratulate\nyourself if nobody ran against\nyou. I had the luck of having\ntwo serious opponents, so\nyou get to read a few more\nparagraphs of my delicate\nprose.\nYour campaign starts with\nbuying Blu-tack. Otherwise\nyou end up with a pile of\nposters and no way to actually\nput them up on the Sherfield\nwalkway before it gets\ncovered in reams of campaign\nmaterial. A good campaigning\nposter has your face, your\nname, the position you\u2019re\nrunning for, a nice sentence or\ntwo on what you stand for (the\nvalues part this time), and the\nofficial \u201cLeadership Elections\u201d\nlogo on it. This year\u2019s cringiest\nposter slogan was \u201cJust\nanother supporting character\nin the inspiring story of your\nlife\u201d, so you have a low bar to\nclear.\nThis should be done by the\nWednesday before voting\nopens. Afterwards, you\ncampaign physically. I am\nsure you have interacted with\na campaigner during this\nelection season, as they often\ncome and address lecture\ntheatres or hand out flyers. So\ninstead of telling you what I\ndid, I will tell you how it felt.\nThis was the most terrifying\npublic speech I had made,\nand I had peddled pseudoscience to 600 people before\nthat (tickets for this year\u2019s\nBahfest are selling out! Grab\nthem while you can!) because\nthis time, it\u2019s about you, about\nconvincing other people you\nare worthy of their trust as a\nperson. As a postgrad, I also\nwent to the labs to interact\nwith PhD students, and it is the\nsame gut-wrenching, palm-sweating, shoulder-shaking\nexperience when doing it\none-on-one. And you do it\nday after day, each time as\nnervous as the time before,\nuntil voting finally closes on\nFriday. Often, you will come\nout as less eloquent than you\nwished, or fail to convince\nsomeone to vote (particularly\npostgrads who feel that the\nUnion does nothing for them).\nBut it doesn\u2019t matter: you are\nroleplaying another person,\none that is smarter and more\nsocial than you, and it\u2019s fun.\nThat\u2019s right: the terror of\nspeaking to strangers blurs\ninto the joy of expressing\nyourself somewhere during\nthe conversation. When the\nresults came in, I was happy\nto have won, but that joy was\nnothing compared to how\nI felt each time I convinced\nsomeone to vote.\nSo if you are here next time\naround, run or campaign: it is\nprobably the most interesting\nexperience you will have at\nImperial.\n\\\\ This way you can feel\nthe thrill of the elections\nwithout actually standing for\nanything, or even voting \\\\\n\\\\ This year's\ncringiest slogan\nwas \"Just another\nsupporting character\nin the inspiring story\nof your life\", so you\nhave a low bar to\nclear \\\\\n\\\\ A manifesto is\nonly the second most\nimportant part of\nyour election profile.\nThe picture is where\nyou need your\nA-game \\\\\n\n"

Mom,\nI love you, but you have no\nidea how to prepare lamb.\nBut, a couple of weeks ago, it\nwas my best friend\u2019s birthday\nand we decided to organise\na little dinner for him and,\nlong story short, we decided\nthat lamb is something you\ncannot go wrong with,\nespecially because it\u2019s his\nfavourite food. And our little\nexperiment turned out quite a\nsuccess, in the end.\nWhile getting ready to\nprepare this delicious meal,\nkeep in mind that it\u2019s enough\nfor quite a lot of people \u2013\ndepending on how hungry\nthey are, four or even six.\nSo you shouldn\u2019t make it too\nspicy or too anything in fact\nbecause, you know, not everyone has the same preference\nas you do.\nOr, maybe, everyone likes\nit a bit spicier than you do\nand you don\u2019t want to ruin\neverybody\u2019s meal because\nyou are a weakling. This dish\nis very good exactly because\nit is spicy enough and somewhat sweet. Just like you after\nyou\u2019ve had mexican.\nIngredients\nFor the marinade\n1 \u00bd tsp cumin seeds (yes, I know\nthat some while ago I said I hate\nthem, but in some dishes they are\njust right and yes, you can totally\njudge me)\n\u00bd tsp fennel seeds\n\u00bc tsp caraway seeds\n3 tbsp olive oil\n3 garlic cloves, peeled\n1 \u00bd tsp fresh root ginger\n1-2 mild chillies\n1 \u00bd tsp ground coriander\n1/8 tsp smoked paprika\n1 tsp salt\n1 tsp tomato paste\n1 \u00bd tbsp lemon juice (preferably\nfreshly squeezed)\n2 tsp granulated sugar\nCayenne pepper\nFor the lamb\n800g rack of lamb\n1 tsp olive oil\nOptional, if you want to serve it\nin order to impress people: get\nsome salad leaves for plating\nFor the aubergine dip\n2 aubergines\n1 tsp lemon juice (again, use\nyour just acquired skill for\nmaking it)\nFor the marinade preheat\na frying pan and toast the\ncumin, fennel and caraway\nseeds for a few minutes. My\neditor-in-chief went into a\ntangent about how easy it\nis to over-roast seeds and\nburn them and how that can\nreally ruin a good curry, and\nhow he learned this from his\nShrilankan bestie but I will\nnot do the same thing to you\nand bore you for a good ten\nminutes. Besides this isn\u2019t a\ncurry. This part is followed by\nsomething trickier: you then\nare supposed to crush the\ntoasted seeds into a relatively\nfine powder. If you have a\nfood processor, then it\u2019s easy-peasy! If not, you will have\nto get a bit creative \u2013 not\ndangerously creative, like\ndropping a bowling ball on\nthem from a \u2018safe\u2019 height.\nMix the powder with the\nother marinade ingredients\nuntil the mixture becomes a\nfairly smooth paste. Though\nI could mention the quantity\nof cayenne pepper you add,\nit\u2019s really entirely up to you.\nYou know how much spice\nyou can handle. If not, take a\nguess and may the force be\nwith you!\nPlace three quarters of\nthe marinade and the lamb\nracks in a Ziplock bag and\nrefrigerate for at least five\nhours. I recommend letting\nthem sit overnight \u2013 I know,\nno student is able to plan\ntheir meals in advance, but if\nyou\u2019re goinmg to cook then at\nleast cook them properly. You\nare on the path of becoming\na chef \u2013 just in case you fail\nyour exams and subsequently\nyour chance in academia and\na better life \u2013 so better act\nlike one!\nFor the aubergine dip (side\nnote: you\u2019d be doing this\nthe following day), wash the\naubergines and let them dry.\nOver an open flame \u2013 and\ntotally ignoring the no fire\nrule of the college \u2013 or over a\nBunsen burner when no one is\nlooking, roast the skins of the\naubergines until they blacken.\nLeave to cool.\nTake the lamb out of the\nfridge and let it rest until it\nreaches room temperature.\nPreheat the oven at 200\u00ba C.\nSear the lamb in the olive\noil. Make sure all sides are\nequally done. Try not to overcook it however. Wrap the\nracks in aluminium foil and\nplace in the oven for 10-15\nminutes.\nLet the meat rest before\ncarving it. You should let it\nrest for at least half the time\nyou cooked it, while making\nsure it doesn\u2019t get cold.\nTake the aubergines and\nremove the blackened skin.\nMash the flesh with a fork\nand add the remaining marinade and the lemon juice.\nMix until smooth. Transfer into\na serving bowl \u2013 or you know\nwhat, you can just serve it in\nthe same bowl you\u2019ve prepared it and enjoy the feeling\nof having less dishes to wash\nup. I know you will.\nI hope you will find time to\ncook this mouthwatering dish\nbetween all the last-minute\nassignments you\u2019ve been\npostponing since forever.\nEnjoy your holiday and\nyour mom\u2019s home-cooked\nfood while you can (unless\nshe can\u2019t cook and you only\ntakeaway when you go\nhome). And, in case you don\u2019t\nhear from me in time for your\nexams next term, good luck\nwith them. Don\u2019t fuck them up.\nYou\u2019re not a chef quite yet.\n\\\\ Mom, I love you,\nbut you have no\nidea how to prepare\nlamb \\\\\naubergine dip\nAndrada Balmez\nDon\u2019t you just love how cute baby lambs are? And tasty. Don\u2019t forget how tasty \\\\ Noel Reynolds\n\n"

Wandering\nsamurai Jack is still locked in\nan uphill battle against the\ndemon Aku, and still stuck in\na hellish future spawned from\nhim. Genndy Tartakovsky\u2019s\naesthetic delight begins in\nmedia res, as had become a\nstaple of the show\u2019s original\nrun. An opening monologue\nhelpfully informs us that 50\nyears have passed since Jack\nwas thrown into an unfamiliar\nfuture, and in that time he has\nnot aged. Not physically, at\nleast.\nThe Jack we find ourselves\nfollowing now is a shell of\nhis former self, haunted by\nhis continuing failure and the\nspectres of his past, all while\nstill half-heartedly continuing\nthe struggle against Aku.\nTartakovsky\u2019s signature blend\nof beauty and terror works to\ngreat effect once more here,\nwith the seamless transitions\nof environment into Jack\u2019s\nhallucinations excellently\nportraying his fragile mental\nstate.\nAdvances in technology\nmean that the art in general\nfeels crisper, and the colour\npallet is more vibrant. This\nallows the series\u2019 minimal-ist, yet potent, feel to shine\nlike never before. Jack\u2019s\nrevamped design is imposing\nand refreshing. Immediately,\nthe new armour, bike, and\nguns generate intrigue and\nhook new and old viewers\nalike. Thematically, the\narmour shows us that this is\nnot quite the Jack we used to\nknow. The increased reliance\non technology acts as a\ncrutch, revealing that even\nthough physically he remains\nunchanged, psychologically\nhe has grown weary.\nNarratively, Samurai Jack\nseems to have evolved to\nkeep pace with its audience.\nThe traditional, self-contained\nepisode structure is cast off to\ninstead opt for a season-wide\narc. Parallel to Jack\u2019s adven-tures, we also follow seven\nyoung girls being trained\nby a cult to hunt down and\nkill Jack. This sets up what is\nlikely to be one of the major\nplot lines of the season, and\ngives us an additional POV\ncharacter in the form of the\nassassin, Ashi.\nHer journey and introduction in this episode are a dark\nmirror to Jack\u2019s own. We\nare given glimpses of what\nshe could be without her\nconditioning, and it seems as\nif her perspective will allow\nfor an interesting exploration\nof how world views and perceptions can shape us. The\nepisode also sets up a bundle\nof narrative threads that will\nhopefully come to fruition\nthroughout. The audience\nis enticed by the mystery of\nJack\u2019s missing sword, as well\nas wondering how the world\nhas changed in 50 years.\nAdditionally, the series\nalso seems unafraid to tackle\nmore mature themes this time\naround. It takes unflinching\nlooks at Jack\u2019s guilt and\nthe nature of his hope and\ndespair. After 50 years, the\ncracks are beginning to show.\nSeries creator\nTartakovsky\nhas\nTime doesn\u2019t heal all wounds \\\\ Cartoon Network\\Adult Swim\nimplied that this season will\nbe an exploration of the\nhero\u2019s journey. More specif-ically, the creators hope to\nexplore what happens to the\nhero as their journey begins\nto stall.\nThe comedy and creativity\nof the series are as lively as\never, with the introduction\nof a musical robot assassin\nbased on Sammy Davis Jr.\nVoiced by veteran voice\nactor Tom Kenny, the robot\nThe future holds no comfort \\\\ Cartoon Network\\Adult Swim\nprovides a fascinating temporary distraction. He serves as\na perfect counter-balance to\nthe episode\u2019s darker aspects.\nThe brief moments of comedy\nshine because of their\nabsurdity.\nOne notable omission from\nthe episode is Aku\u2019s presence\n(save for a small cameo).\nAgain, this adds to the sense\nof mystique and, in addition,\ncreates an anticipation that is\nlikely to keep people coming\nback. Granted, this may have\nmore to do with original\nvoice actor Mako\u2019s\nunfortunate\npassing. All in\nall, the latest\nepisode is\na worthy\ncontinuation\nof the\nseries\nand\ndeftly\nbuilds\nexpectations for\nthe rest of\nthe season.\n\\\\ The Jack we find\nourselves following\nnow is a shell of his\nformer self, haunted\nby his continuing\nfailure \\\\\n\\\\ It takes unflinching looks at Jack\u2019s\nguilt and the nature\nof his hope and\ndespair.

Inadequate\nfacilities, which needed\na follow-up repair visit\nreportedly costing an\nadditional \u00a320,000. The\nfollow up work didn\u2019t improve\nisolation. According to a\nSandy Brown report, \u201cIt is\nconsidered that the sound\ninsulation performance is\nunlikely to have significantly\nincreased\u201d and in fact\nit appears to have been\nreduced by 8dB according to\na May 2015 report, making\nJ&R practice louder to the\nbedrooms above than it\nmust have been before the\nchanges.\nUp until last year, the Union,\nCollege and the contractors\nhave been constantly locked\nin endless backs and forths.\nHowever, last term, Union\nPresident, Nas Andriopoulos,\nconfirmed that works would\nbe taking place to rectify\nthe situation. Whether the\nrecord low NSS scores\nencouraged college to pour\nmore resources in this project\nA\ns the Spring\nterm draws\nto an end,\nso should\nthe West\nB a s e m e n t\nrefurbishment which has seen\nnumerous student media\nfacilities intermittently being\ncordoned off over the course\nof the last few years. This last\nleg of the works should mark\nthe end of a cumulative \u00a31.27\nmillion investment.\nIf all goes according to\nplan, next term should most\nimportantly see the reopening\nof the Jazz & Rock (J&R)\npractice room which has been\nclosed for over a year now as a\nresult of poor soundproofing.\nThe J&R room was originally\ndelivered back to students in\n2014, after a major overhaul\nof the West Basement that cost\nabout \u00a31 million. The project\nwas a result of Imperial\nCollege\u2019s accommodation\nexpansion into Beit\u2019s East\nBasement, which was\npreviously a Union space\nused by student groups. The\nEast Basement hosted, among\nother things, the Chaplaincy\n(which has been temporarily\nmoved to Princes Gardens). In\nexchange for the lost space,\nCollege financed a state-of-the-art media redevelopment.\nThe Union invested an\nadditional \u00a3100,000 in\nequipment.\nHowever, almost\nimmediately after the delivery\nof the West Basement back to\nthe students, the poor quality\nof the works became evident.\nThe main issue was and still\nis soundproofing. Inadequate\nvertical soundproofing\nhas lead to the raising of\ncomplaints from residents\nin Beit and the subsequent\nlimitation of practice hours\nto 11pm at first, then 9pm,\nthen 7pm and eventually the\ncomplete shutdown of the\nspace. Similarly inadequate\nhorizontal soundproofing\nhas meant that J&R use has\nbeen disruptive to IC Radio\u2019s\nbroadcasting as well as ICTV\nactivities in the neighbouring\nshared studio. The poor\nconstruction is not limited to\nthe J&R room, but affects other\nspaces as well, as became\nwidely apparent during the\n2016 Meet the Candidates\nBroadcast (the pundits in the\nsupposedly isolated radio\nsuite could be heard through\nto the shared studio where\nthe candidates were being\ninterviewed).\nIn the original report\nproduced by Max Hunter,\na then student who\u2019d\nbeen heavily involved in\nImperial Student Media, the\nrecommendation is for the\nJ&R room to be specifically\n\u201cdesigned by acousticians and\nsoundproofed to high grade\n(particularly to avoid spill onto\nBeit Quad, and across the rest\nof the media basement.\u201d\nDespite the report\u2019s\nrecommendations (and\ninclusion of suggested\nacousticians) College\ndecided to go ahead with\nSandy Brown, who might\nbe a large and reputable\nfirm, but mainly specialise in\neducational consultancy for\nthe construction of lecture\ntheatres.\nThe Sandy Brown consultants\nreportedly advised that\nthe soundproofing values\nrequested by the students\nare for professional studios\nand it would be very difficult\nand costly to achieve such\nlevels of isolation in the West\nBasement. In fact it would\nrequire building a room inside\na room.\nThe counter proposal was\nto follow current acoustic\nperformance standards\nfor schools widely used to\nset acoustic performance\nstandards in other educational\nbuildings. Despite Hunter and\nothers at the time noticing\noddities and potential errors\nin the report, their objections\nwere unreported and the\nRising complaints shut down the J&R space \\\\ Iggyshoot\n\\\\ This last leg of\nthe works should\nmark the end of a\ncumulative \u00a31.27\nmillion investment \\\\\n\\\\ The\nsoundproofing\nvalues requested by\nthe students are for\nprofessional studios\nand it would be very\ndifficult and costly to\nachieve \\\\\nThe new practice room will allegedly be finished in April \\\\ ANDR3W A\nremains unconfirmed, though\na Union source heavily\nimplied they did. Regardless,\nAndriopoulos\u2019 work in\nsecuring funds has been\ninvaluable. As current chair\nof the Club told felix \u201cNas has\ndone a terrific job at making\nthings actually happen.\u201d\nIt should be noted that this\nyear\u2019s works have reportedly\ncost an additional \u00a350,000\nand have in turn met a\nseries of delays. Though\nthey were originally meant\nto be undertaken over the\nwinter break and completed\nby the start of spring term,\nconstruction workers told felix\nthat the works have suffered\ndelays due to unpredictable\nissues such as the need to\nreroute heating pipes, the\ndiscovery of \u201cmystery pipes\u201d\nwhich weren\u2019t in the the\noriginal building plans and\na near flood among other\nthings.\nThese complications, as well\nas the need to limit working\nhours to minimise disruption,\nhave caused the move of some\nstudents staying in the rooms\ndirectly above the space, as\nwell the pushing back of the\ndelivery date; first to February,\nthen to March, and now April.\nWhen students will reclaim\nthe J&R room remains to be\nseen.\nissue of Tie Clubs has been\nraised at Council according to\nOlson. However, he said that\nprevious attempts to discuss\nthe Union\u2019s affiliation to these\nClubs have been almost\nimmediately terminated as a\nresult of Tie Club pressures.\nOlson told felix that he had\nbeen tasked by Council to find\nout whether the Links Club\naccepted women in their ranks\n(The 22s notoriously don\u2019t),\nas there was no mention in\ntheir online resources. \u201cAfter\nsending a one-line email to a\nmember of the CGCA (CGCU\nalumni association) I received\nsnarky remarks from different\nalumni in the subsequent\nalumni meetings. After this, it\nwas extremely difficult for me\nto contact them and to try to\norganise events with them.\u201d\nTrying to look into Tie Club\nYour new sabbs are here\nYou can forget about elections for the rest of the year\nJoanna Wormald\nfelix after being involved\nin the paper for the past\nfive years. He has pledged\nto protect felix from Union\ninterference, encourage\nmore student involvement,\ndevelop our digital strategy,\nand enhance collaboration\nwith other societies. A focus\non investigative journalism\nwill also help us to hold the\nCollege, Union, and new\nsabbs to account.\nSo you\u2019ve done your civic\nduty (or at least 6704 of you\ndid) and it\u2019s over. With that,\nyou can stop caring (or, more\naccurately, pretending to\ncare) about elections. At least\nfor a few months.\nF\nollowing a 36.79%\nturnout (down a bit\nfrom last year but\nstill the third-highest\nin the country\naccording to the\nUnion website), elections are\nfinally over and winners have\nbeen announced.\nAs previously reported,\nout of the 21 candidates\nstanding for sabbatical\npositions, only 13 were ever\nserious contenders. Of the five\ncandidates running for Union\nPresident, only one submitted\na manifesto and headshot. It\u2019s\nhardly surprising then that this\nposition went to Alex Chippy\nCompton. Having spent the\npast year as ICSMSU President\nand previously held more than\na dozen positions on society\ncommittees, she certainly\nappears to have the practical\nunderstanding required to\nenact her campaign pledges.\nRunning a clear and concise\ncampaign (the three key points\nof which handily spelled out\nhis name), your new Deputy\nPresident (Clubs & Societies)\nis Thomas Bacarese-Hamilton.\nOne of four medics elected to\na sabbatical position, Thomas\nhas promised to provide better\ntraining for volunteers and\nimprove the transparency and\nmanagement of societies.\nNicholas Burstow also\nfavoured a three-point plan.\nThe aims of the newly elected\nDeputy President (Education)\ncan be essentially summarised\nas a desire to increase\ncommunication between\nstudents and staff\u2014 something\nhe already has experience\nwith in his role as the current\nICSM Academic Affairs\nOfficer.\nHoping to collaborate with\nNick is Fintan O\u2019Connor,\nthe new Deputy President\n(Welfare). The two positions\nare \u201cinextricably linked\u201d and\ncover areas such as student\nsupport and better access to\npersonal tutors, which Fintan\ndescribed in his manifesto as\n\u201ca lucky dip\u201d. His remit will\nalso include important issues\nsuch as mental health and\nsexual assault and consent. As\nCGCU Welfare Officer, Fintan\nhas worked closely with the\ncurrent DP (Welfare) so is a\npromising pick for next year.\nMeanwhile, the position of\nDeputy President (Finance &\nServices) goes to Matthew\nBlackett. This is a seemingly\napt choice given his studies\nat the Business School and\nvarious \u201cpositions of financial\nresponsibility\u201d. Promises of\npre-poured pints probably\ndidn\u2019t do him any harm either.\nFinally, next year sees Fred\nFyles ascend from Culture\nEditor to Editor-in-Chief at\nA\npaper is to be\npresented at\nnext week\u2019s\nC o u n c i l\nmeeting asking\nthe Union to\nstop handing out tankards to\nthe so-called \u2018Tie Clubs\u2019. These\nare invite-only \u2018secret\u2019 clubs,\nmembers of which can be\neasily identified on a night out\nas they adorn characteristic\nties.\nThe paper presented by\nAndrew Olson, ordinary\nCouncil member, argues\nthat Tie Clubs do not meet\nthe standards of the Union\u2019s\nEquality of Opportunities\nPolicy, namely, fostering\n\u201dan environment free of\nunfair discrimination and\nharassment\u201d. Therefore,\naccording to the policy, they\nshould be suspended and not\ngranted \u201cthe use of Union\nresources and facilities\u201d\nThe paper aims at the\nremoval of the tankards of\nThe 22 Club, The Chaps Club\nand The Links Club, at least\nuntil they \u201cprovide sufficient\nevidence that they comply\nwith the Equal Opportunities\nPolicy to the satisfaction of\nUnion Council\u201d.\nThis may mean the clubs\nwould have to provide\ndetailed information on their\ncurrent student members\u2019\ndemographic, including\nrace, gender and social\nbackground. It is also likely\nthat complying with an\nEquality of Opportunities\nPolicy would translate into\nabandoning the \u201cinvite-only\u201d\nmember\u2019s policy that many of\nthese Clubs adopt.\nThis is not the first time the\nculture can also prove tricky\nwhen a large percentage of\nsabbatical officers are also\nmembers of these clubs. For\nexample, Nas Andriopoulos,\ncurrent Union President, is\na member of the 22s, as is\nnext year\u2019s Deputy President\n(Finance and Services),\nMatt Blackett. This year\u2019s\nDeputy President (Clubs\nand Societies), James Cox\nis reportedly a 22 and was\ninitiated right before he was\nelected, during the election\nresults last year.\nIn response to felix\u2019s enquiry\nthe Union said: \u201cThe tie clubs\nare not affiliated to Imperial\nCollege Union and we do\nnot fund, support, govern\nor administrate them in any\nway; their policies are their\nresponsibility.\u201d\nWe also approached the\n\\\\ Out of the 21\ncandidates standing\nfor sabbatical\npositions, only\nthirteen were ever\nserious contenders \\\\\n\u2018Drinking societies\u2019 face tankard ban\nLef Apsotolakis\nChaps Chair George Warner.\nAccording to Warner, the\nclub has always \u201chad a\npolicy of promoting student\nand alumni involvement within\nImperial College, especially\nthe RSM.\n\u201cAs of last year we\nintroduced our first female\nmember, after a vote including\nstudent and alumni members.\nThis is not \u2018tokenism\u2019, but a\ngenuine effort to change, as\nsuch the club has been inviting\nfemale members of the RSM\nto Chaps events for the last\nthree years in a bid change\ngeneral opinion of the club\ntowards being all-inclusive.\nFor the avoidance of doubt,\nwe do not discriminate on any\ncharacteristic.\u201d\nWhether the Tie Clubs will\nsuccessfully refute Olson\u2019s\nClaims remains to be seen.\n\n"

The band\u2019s unique\nsonic coupled with Murphy\u2019s\ncomedically cynical lyrics\nhave cemented their place in\nmy most listened band on my\nrather bloated six-year-old\niPod Classic. The band split\nafter only two albums but\nreturned last year for a festival tour. I was lucky enough\nto witness their 2am, two hour\nset in Denmark which was\neasily the best set I have ever\nseen live.\nFinally, there\u2019s Father John\nMisty. Though he\u2019s probably\nbetter known for his work as\npart of the indie folk band\nFleet Foxes, his 2015 solo\nalbum I Love you, Honeybear\nwas incredibly well critically\nreceived, getting praise for\nthe same imaginative orches-tral-pop melodies which\nshot Arcade Fire to fame a\ndecade earlier.

This explosion\nin hip-hop isn\u2019t going\nanywhere any time soon\nbut, 2017 might just see a\nresurgence of indie.\nThis year is set to see the\nrelease of a number of new\nalbums from indie giants, such\nas Father John Misty, Arcade\nFire and LCD Soundsystem\n(yes, I know they were\nsupposed to have broken\nup but I\u2019m not complaining\nand neither should you).

Whilst\njournalists at the time were\nthrowing around terms like\n\u2018landfill indie\u2019 in response to\nthe slew of un-inventive bands\nwhich were inundating record\nshops, Arcade Fire managed\nto catch the eye of Merge\nRecords and subsequently\nproduced one of the most critically acclaimed albums of the\ndecade, Funeral. Its daring\n\u2018baroque pop\u2019 sound was a\nJoe O\u2019Connell-Danes\nsubject matter of the lyrics.\nSo, are these three albums\nenough to herald the return\nof indie music? Who knows!\nThe biggest hurdle that these\nalbums need to overcome in\norder for them to bring back\nindie is to engage with the\ncounter-cultural roots of the\ngenre. Only then will they\nmake the impact the names\nattached to the records\ndeserve.\nThe genre must climb down\nfrom its romanticised past and\naddress the important social\nand political climate into\nwhich these records are about\nto be released, if they are to\nconnect with their audience\nin the same manner the post-punk records of the mid-1980s\ndid. Furthermore, these music\nlegends must not be afraid to\ndevelop their sound and take\ninfluence from innovations in\nthe electronic music scene.\nGet all of that right and we\ncould be in store for some\nabsolutely cracking albums\nlater this year.\nhis work in Fleet Foxes. Importantly, the indie folk scene\nhasn\u2019t been untouched by this\nshift towards the experimental\nand electronic. The modern\nflagship names of the subgenre like Bon Iver and Sufjan\nStevens have all released new\nmusic with a contemporary\nflair whilst still preserving the\nroots of the sonic. From what\nwe have heard of the first few\nsingles from Pure Comedy is\nthat Tillman is certainly intent\non making good his reasons\nfor leaving Fleet Foxes with\na considerably darker and\nmore political tone to the new\nmusic. The singles move ominously between keys to create\na pretty eclectic dissonance\nbuilding and reinforcing the\n\\\\ The biggest\nhurdle that these\nalbums need to\novercome in order\nfor them to bring\nback indie, is to\nengaging with the\ncounter-cultural\nroots of the genre \\\\\nsign of things to come as the\nband dragged indie music\ninto a new, more electronic,\nera.\nLCD Soundsystem took this\nmove towards the electronic\nand put it on steroids.

The Legend\nof Zelda: Breath of the Wild\nis a masterpiece on many\nlevels. Its vast, gorgeous open\nT\nhe first thing I did\nafter unboxing my\nNintendo Switch\nwas to lick the game\ncartridge. Videos\nof games and tech\njournalists doing the same\nwent viral during the week\nof the Switch\u2019s launch after\nJeff Gertsmann of Giant\nBomb discovered their bitter\naftertaste.

The console looks\nand feels like a device built\nfor adults (unless you buy the\ngarish neon colour option).\nNintendo advertise it as\nsomething that works at home\nor on the go, fitting into your\nbusy lifestyle but offering\nsomething more substantial\nthan their previous handheld\nofferings. However, its large\nsize means it\u2019s a bit awkward\nto play on public transport.\nWhen you\u2019re somewhere\na bit more stable, standing\nthe device up and removing\nthe left and right controllers reveals the console\u2019s\nmost promising feature:\ntwo-player multiplayer out-of-the-box. Best demoed\nwith the cooperative puzzler\nSnipperclips, handing half\nof a controller to a friends\nis incredibly satisfying and\nquintessentially Nintendo.\nPutting the controllers back\ninto place makes a loud\nphysical, digital, click noise,\ngiving the player the sense\nthat they are constructing and\nreconstructing the console.\nLike Lego, but for adults.\nThe Wii brought the family\ntogether in a way games had\nnever done before, and now\nthe Switch does the same\nfor you and a friend.

I can play it\nanywhere: on my TV, on the\nsofa, on the tube, or in bed\nand the experience is always\nthe same.\nOther than Zelda, I\u2019ve\nplayed a number of indie\ngames on the device. Games\nthat would once have been\nonly available on PC or PS4\nnow work just as well, without\nany extra development, in\nportable mode.

Just\na year and a half later,\nanother 300 institutions\nhaveannounceddivestment\ncommitments, and the total\nfunds divested have more\nthan doubled to $5.46\ntrillion. Divest Imperial\ncampaigners hope that\nthey can capitalise on\nthis trend to push for\ndivestment at Imperial.\nT\nhis Monday will see\nthe relaunch of the\nfossil fuel divestment\ncampaign at\nImperial. The new\ncampaign will\nbe called Divest Imperial,\nand at the official Launch\nParty on Monday evening\ncampaigners are hoping to\nconvince students that the\nrecent successes of divestment\ngroups such as the one based\nin King\u2019s, can be replicated at\nImperial.\nMany universities, and\nother public bodies such\nas councils and funding\nbodies, have large\ninvestment portfolios\nconsisting of stocks and\nshares in a wide range of\ncompanies. The portfolios\nusually serve as an\nadditional revenue stream\nfor the university, and\nare typically comprised\nof shares in a range of\ndifferent companies and\nsectors. This often includes\nlarge amounts invested\nin fossil fuel companies.\nDivestment campaigners\nargue that by investing\nin fossil fuel companies,\nuniversities are tacitly\nendorsing their behaviour\nand business models.\nImperial\u2019s own\nendowment of \u00a3126.2\nmillion is used to \u201cdeliver\na material and growing\nsource of unfettered funds\nfor the academic mission\u201d.\nOf this figure, about five\nmillion is directly invested\nin fossil fuel companies,\nwith further investments\nin externally managed\nfunds which may also\ncontain fossil fuel shares.\nAlongside money it\nreceives for research\nfunding, this places\nImperial third in the UK for\nits financial dependence\non fossil fuel companies,\nbehind Manchester and\nCambridge.\nFossil fuel divestment\nbegan in the US in 2011,\nand 35 US universities have\ncommitted to divest up to\nthis point in time. Most, such\nas Boston University and\nGeorgetown University,\nhave divested from fossil\nfuels entirely; others\nincluding Yale, Stanford,\nand Columbia have begun\nby divesting from the most\nheavily polluting fuels,\nusually coal and tar sands.\nThe UK, however, is\nleading the movement,\nwith 45 universities \u2013 over\na quarter of all universities\nin the country \u2013 having\nannounced divestment\nproposals following\nstudent pressure. High\nprofile institutions such as\nEdinburgh, Oxford, and\nthe LSE are among those\ncommitted to divestment,\nand a rising divestment\ntide in London looks set to\nengulf UCL, precipitated\nby the successful King\u2019s\ndivestment campaign.\nGlobally, the divestment\nmovement is growing\nexponentially. Having\nbegun with a handful of\ncollege campuses six years\nago, by late 2015 some\n$2.6 trillion of investments\nhad been removed from\nfossil fuels companies,\n\\\\ The UK, however,\nis leading the\nmovement, with 45\nuniversities having\nfivested already \\\\\nIt\u2019sopen.Areyou?\nThefelixSEXSURVEY\nYou know you want to take it.\nfelixonline.co.uk/go/callmedaddy\n\n"

Commonfolk may\nbe misguided by their SCR\nbreakfasts or the library caf\u00e9 'food'. But\nI will dispel these myths them with one\nsimple example: The Granola Yoghurt.\nIn simpler times, AKA a few months ago,\nthere was a product known as the Strawberry Compote and Muesli Greek Yoghurt.\nI chanced upon it as I was searching for a\nhealthier alternative to my daily snacking\nroutine of indulging in chocolate-based\nitems from the vending machines. The\nslightly tangy Greek yoghurt was accentuated by the mellow sweetness of the\nstrawberry compote and was elevated\nby the heartiness of the muesli. It seemed\nnatural. Whole. Complete. It was the pinnacle of breakfast foods. A champion of late\nafternoon snacks. A perfect dairy delicacy.\nBut now I look around and I see their numbers dwindling. Like baby tigers, the hubris\nof humanity has inadvertently begun the\nprocess of eradicating this gift from nature.\nInstead, we are offered a joke of a replace-ment. The granola yogurt.\nAt first I was shocked. I love cherries.\nBut I hate anything cherry flavoured, as\nit would always have the sickly chemical\ntaste that reminds you of terrible, bed-rid-den sick days of childhood. The days where\nyou couldn\u2019t go to school, but you were too\nsick to do anything fun at home. Instead\nyou stared at the ceiling for hours and ate\ntasteless porridge, and the only flavour\n\\\\ One subtle, yet\nhorrendously apparent detail\nruined my entire experience:\nthe raisins \\\\\nyou experienced in that day\nwas the horrid fake cherry\nflavoured cough syrup which\nmade you gag and feel even\nworse than before.\nSure, the change in texture\nwas welcomed, and I grew\naccustomed to the \u201cblack\ncherry\u201d flavour after a while.\nBut one subtle, yet horrendously apparent detail ruined\nmy entire experience: the rai-sins. The raisins were the only\nsources of natural flavours\nwithin the item. They could\nhave gone on out of two ways\nwith the raisin count: Either\nuse large amounts of raisins to\nenhance the flavour profile of\nthe bland yoghurt, or use no\nraisins at all to embrace the\nsad chemical flavour. However, they chose the worst\npossibility of all \u2013 they added\nan average of about two raisins per container. Each raisin\nteased your taste buds with a\nfaint pure sweetness, yet was\nnever enough to satisfy your\ncravings. Thus, you are left\nwith pure sadness and dissatisfaction after the consumption\nof this trash.\nDo not trust Taste Imperial.\nFirst they came for the Strawberry Compote and Muesli\nGreek Yoghurt, but you did not\nspeak out \u2013 because you don\u2019t\nlike yoghurt\u2026\nR\naisins \u2013 also\nknown as dried\ngrapes \u2013 represent\neverything wrong\nwith our civilisation\nand they seek to\ndisrupt the foundations upon\nwhich this very nation stands,\nand this ingrate, Mr Ma, has\nthe audacity to suggest that we\nneed more raisins in Imperial\nin order to make his breakfast\nbetter. It makes me sick. I\nwill be honest with you, dear\nreaders, that I voted to remain\nin the EU referendum, but if\nBrexit means breakfast, and\nhence means less of this raisin\nloving coming to this country to\ndilute British culture (I bet half\nthe raisins you eat aren't even\ngrown in the UK), then hand\nme a copy of the Daily Mail.\nThe word \u2018raisin\u2019 comes from\nthe latin \u2018racemus\u2019 meaning\na bunch of grapes, further\ncorrupted by old French\nto mean grape. Let me tell\nyou, I will be damned if I put\nanything remotely French\nin my mouth. Why can\u2019t we\nuse English words for English\nfruit? If you ask me this is a\nHong Kong conspiracy to\nmanipulate the FTSE 100 by\nflooding it with raisin stocks,\n\\\\ Removing the raisin\ncomponent allows the\ncustomer to loosen\ntheir gag reflex and\ndown the contents \\\\\nthus making the pound even weaker. Trust\nme Don I have seen this all before \u2013 do\nyou think that I don\u2019t remember the Polish\ngrapefruit conspiracy of 1998?\nFrom a purely food-based viewpoint, why\nyou would want to put dry wrinkled balls of\nfruit into your mouth is beyond me. Imperial\nhave spotted the fact that having to chew\nthese raisins whilst ingesting the yogurt is an\nextremely inefficient way of consuming cal-ories. By removing this component, it allows\nthe customer to loosen their gag reflex and\ndown the contents, thus enabling you to\nstart working yourself to death so that Imperial can receive more grants and president\nGast can line the coffers of the trustees.\nFinally I would like to share with you a\npersonal story. Although your view may\nbe pro-raisin, I have a deep and personal\nvendetta against these wrinkly foes. It was\n1942. I was in a Siberian gulag, persecuted for crimes I did not commit. I made\nfriends with a raisin there named Vanya.\nWe became very close; some might say\neven loved each other. Together we plotted to escape; however, at the final moment\nVanya alerted the guards of my intentions,\ndistracting them from his escape, and forcing me to spend four more years alone in\nthat wretched hole. Never trust a raisin.\nNever.\nThere's no place\nat Imperial for\nelitist 'secret'\nclubs\nAndrew Olson thinks it's time the\nexclusive drinking societies were held\nto the same standard as everyone else\nE\nveryone studying at\nImperial is aware\nthat this place is not\nperfect. Yes, there\nare problems with\nstudent engagement,\nmental health, even sexism.\nBut despite these issues, I\nfeel it is the place which has\nmainly contributed at making\nme who I am today; the\nfantastic wardening team\nin my halls in first year, the\nchallenging environment and,\nmore importantly, the Imperial\ncommunity of incredibly\ninteresting people from all\nover the world which I could\nalways learn something from.\nBecause of this mental image\nthat I had of Imperial and the\nUnion, I was rather surprised\nwhen I learnt about the Tie\nClubs. It all started last year,\nwhen I was asked as CGCU\nPresident to obtain some\ninformation about our Tie\nClub, The Links. I emailed a\nfew alumni regarding this, and\ngot very vague responses.\nThis led to snarky remarks in\nsubsequent alumni meetings,\nas well as a sense that I was\nnot welcome any more. It\nwas very obvious I had asked\nthe wrong questions. But you\nmight be asking yourself:\nwhat exactly is a Tie Club?\nI\u2019ll summarise it for you: there\nare three Tie Clubs: The 22s,\n\\\\ You might be asking\nyourself: what exactly is a tie\nclub? \\\\\nThe Chaps and The Links,\ndominated by rugby players\nfrom the different Constituent\nUnions. Invite-only, The 22s\ndon\u2019t admit women, and The\nLinks have been accused of\ntokenism as even though they\ndo admit women they only\nhave one female member that\nI know of. They meet in the\nUnion bar to drink, and are\nknown as probably the best\nexample of 'lad culture' (They\nliterally started as boys-only\nclubs) at Imperial. Another\nclub, The 15s, was founded\nlast year as a female version\nof the 22s, but there is not\nmuch information about their\nactivities as they don\u2019t seem to\nbe as active as the older Tie\nClubs. How can we reconcile\nthe image of Imperial College\nas an open, international\nuniversity where you are\njudged not on the colour or\nyour skin or your gender,\nbut on your performance\nand ability, with secret invite-only societies where (mostly)\nprivately educated white men\nmeet to drink? We can\u2019t forget\nthat these societies act as\nvery effective alumni groups,\ngiving easier access to jobs\nto their members, already\nbenefiting a privileged class.\nIf you disagree then you don't\nunderstand the concept of\nnetworking. I am not against\nfreedom of association. I\nbelieve that if a group of\nmen want to meet and help\neach other out in their own\ntime, they can do that even\nif I don\u2019t agree with it. What\nis worrying, though, is when\nthese organisations have deep\nconnections with powerful\nentities including Imperial\nCollege Union, which could\nallow them to bend rules . In\nthis context it is important to\n\\\\ 40% of the\nsabbatical team in\nthe Union this year\nare members of Tie\nClubs \\\\\nremember that 40% of the\nsabbatical team in the Union\nthis year are members of Tie\nClubs, and the next DPFS,\nMatthew Blackett, can be seen\nin the picture from the Results\nParty sporting his 22s tie. This\nrepresentation in the hierarchy\nof the Union has traditionally\nallowed them to dominate\nthe conversation and deflect\ncriticism, as can be seen by\nthe utter lack of response\nafter this issue was raised last\nyear at Union Council. The\ncurrent status quo legitimises\nthese organisations and in\nturn this means the Union is\ncondoning their activities. If\nany other club were known\nfor being rude to bar staff,\nbeing loud, and receiving\nconstant allegations of sexism,\nthey would be investigated by\nthe Union. Even worse, if an\nexternal organisation had the\nsame reputation and history\nof discrimination they would\nnot be allowed to use Union\nresources. The exception\n\\\\ If any other club\nwere known for\nbeing rude to bar\nstaff, being loud, and\nreceiving constant\nallegations of sexism,\nthey would be\ninvestigated by the\nUnion \\\\\nalways seems to be the Tie\nClubs.Withallthisinformation,\nit is important to ask ourselves,\nwhy are they even there? Why\ndoes the Union make mention\nof them in their policies as an\nexception? Why are they not\nheld to the same standards\nas any club, society, project\nor external organisation?\nThe wider student body don\u2019t\nknow about them, the bar staff\nhate working when they are\naround, and the people who\ndo know about them think\nthey are outdated. Tie Clubs\nmight have been an accurate\nrepresentation of Imperial\nCollege in the 70s (remember,\nwomen weren\u2019t allowed in\nthe Union bar until 1975),\nbut they are definitely not a\nrepresentation of the Imperial\nthat I know. Yes, if you don\u2019t\nknow about them they\nprobably don\u2019t affect you. But\nin this day and age of fake\nnews, increasing nationalism,\nan uptick in xenophobia and\nthe general apathy of our\ngeneration, it\u2019s important to\nstand for what is right. This is\na matter of principle: ensuring\nthat the body that is meant to\nrepresent all of us, the Union,\nactually does so, instead of\nrepresenting the interests of a\nfew.\n\\\\ The wider student\nbody doesn't know\nabout them, the bar\nstaff hate working\nwhen they are\naround, and the\npeople who do know\nabout them think they\nare outdated \\\\\n\n"

It is a close-knit and\nfriendly environment, where\neveryone is encouraged to\ndevelop Football skills, and,\nmost importantly, have fun.\nThis time our travels took us\nto Cardiff, for the Southern\nDivision One semi-final\nagainst the Cardiff Cobras.\nThe Cobras had only had one\nloss the whole season. They\nwere primed, ready, with a\nfull and healthy roster. On\nthe other hand, we Immortals\nwere depleted with many\nplayers playing Offence,\nDefence and Special Teams.\nIn warm ups it was evident\nthat we were the smaller\nsquad. To be honest this\nwas an observation made\nat all the games this season;\nbut that never stops us. We\nare Southeast Division One\nChampions, and undefeated\nat home. We are well\ncoached and have more\nquarter. Unfortunately this\nturn was not in our favour.\nA long bomb by the Cobras\u2019\nquarterback was received\nand lead to a massive gain\ndown field. On the day you\ncould sense the Cobras\u2019 confidence grow and momentum\nswitch. With this change in\nthe wind, the Cobras found\nthemselves in the end zone.\nAt this point hearts sank and\ndefence got a second wind.\nCobras slithered through\nthe Immortals\u2019 (injured and\ndepleted) offensive line, this\nmeant that the ball hardly\nprogressed. A stagnant\noffense meant that the defensive spent a lot of time on the\nfield. The QB of the Cobras\nbegan to hit their stride. Pass\nafter pass was received and\nsupplemented by a consistent\nthe win was not deserved by\nthe Cobras, or even that the\nCobras did not deserve the\nfinal score. What can be said\nis that we, Immortals, did not\ndeserve that score; it was definitely not representative of\nthe hearts the players played\nwith. At no point did the\nsquad bend to the will of the\nCobra, and a good fight and\nstrong spirit was displayed\nJason Patrick Kuilan, Guillaume Fontan, David Meine,\nFiraz Ahmad, Tanvir Nazamuddin, Kem Smooth and\nWilliam Ginzo. All these players have made contributions\nto the team, from leading\nit as President to devoting\ntheir time to attend training.\nWhatever their contribution,\nthey will always be Immortal.\nThis has been a great season,\nalthough this game was\nperhaps not the best note to\nend on, it does not take away\nfrom our achievements. From\nrelegation from the top tier of\nuniversity American football\nlast year, to division champions this year; this is a tale\nof retribution that only a few\nteams at Imperial can match.\nHalf of the team this year\nwas made up of rookies.\nSome of the rookies had\nnever heard of American\nFootball in Britain or even\nwatched any NFL. Through\nthe coaching provided these\nplayers are now starters on\nthe team, and some have\npositions on committee.\nWe are now recruiting for\nthe 2017/18 season. If you\nare interested in playing\na fast-paced hard-hitting\nsport, why not give American\nFootball a go?

The first half ended. A\nfrustrated Immortals squad\nattempted to ready themselves for the next half. The\nscore stood at 7-0 Cobras.\nOnly one score between us\nand the finals.\nDuring the break it was evident that the long season had\ntaken its toll. Many players\nwere playing out of position,\neven more playing through\ninjury. The second half saw a\ndifferent picture. The Cobras\nrun game. It was evident that\nthe Immortals were playing\ntheir hearts out. For many\nplayer this could be their last\ngame. Through hit after hit,\nplay after play, Immortals\ntried to stop the advance of\nthe Cobras but to no avail.\nTouchdowns came to the\nCobras one after the other.\nThe final score at the end of\nthe game was 27-0 Cobras.\nWe wish them luck for the\nfinals.\nIt would be lying to say that\nthroughout the game.\nWhen the final whistle blew\na melancholy swept over us.\nWith this game our season\nended. The playing career of\nmany Immortals ended too.\nThis week\u2019s picture consists\nof some of the players (and\ncoaches) that will be leaving\nus this year. From left to right:\nHarry Collini, James Mackay\n(Head Coach), Josemi Id\u00edgoras, Nigvi Tam, Will Coidan,\nHenry Turner, Sam Hill,\nMarkus Mohr, Jorge Ales,\n\\\\ At no point did\nthe squad bend\nto the will of the\nCobra, and a good\nfight and strong\nspirit was displayed\nthoughout the\ngame \\\\\nheart than any other team\nout there; numbers (normally)\ndon\u2019t matter.\nThe start of the game was\nin our favour. For the first few\ndrives, the Cobras Offence\nmade more negative yards\nthan positive; vintage Immortals defence. A similar story\nfor offence. Although no\nbreakout play occurred, the\noffense consistently picked\nup first downs and had little\ntrouble advancing the ball.\nInitially all was good.

You and Larry\nPage are not exactly BFFs. I get\nit. Google donated almost half\na million dollars to the Clinton\ncampaign. California is a sort\nof liberal Disneyland. Nobody\nlikes you there.\nYou also know how powerful\nSilicon Valley has become. I\u2019m\nproposing that you do some-thingthatwillmakebothliberals\nand conservatives happy. Yes,\nboth of them. Not only that, but\nby doing what I\u2019m about to tell\nyou, you\u2019ll come out looking\nlike a powerful bully not to\nbe messed with. You\u2019ll love it!\nWhat I\u2019m proposing, as you\nmight imagine, is that you\nbreak up Facebook. Facebook\nis the world\u2019s most powerful\nmonopoly. There. I said it. It\nhas a monopoly over a huge\nnetwork. Two billion users. It is\n\\\\ acebook being Facebook,\nwith its monopoly of a network of two billion people, is\narguably the most powerful\ncompany in the world \\\\\ngetting more and more difficult\nto compete with Facebook on\nthe same grounds. People don\u2019t\nuse Facebook because it has a\nbetter user experience. No.\nThey use it because their family\nand friends are on it. I couldn\u2019t\njust decide to use a Facebook\ncompetitor, because I need\ntheir network. The 'network\neffect' is a 'winner-takes-it-all'\ngame. If it wasn\u2019t, Google+,\nwith its better user experience,\nwould have probably suc-ceeded. But nobody used it,\nbecause nobody was actually\non Google+ in the first place.\nOkay, Mr Trump, you might\nnow be a bit sceptical of what\nI\u2019m saying, because deep\ndown we all know you\u2019re a\nreasonable person (all the\nflamboyance and pseudo-rac-ist populism is just a big act).\nYou might be thinking that\npeople choose to be on Facebook. Nobody makes them.\nThey could just leave Facebook now. But the problem is,\nthey can\u2019t. Imagine AT&T was\nthe only mobile network provider in the US that managed\nto reach everyone, and there\nwere other little ones used\nby hugely dispersed people\naround the country. Imagine\nAT&T\u2019s policy was then to only\nallow communication with\npeople also on AT&T. Sure,\nthey had their merits \u2013 building\na whole mobile network is not\neasy. But this situation would\nbe a clear monopoly. It would\nbe illegal.\nSo why should the average American (because you\ntry to represent the average\nAmerican, right?) care? Well,\nnot only should the average\nAmerican care, but so should\nyou, as president. Especially\nyou. You see, normally I\nwouldn\u2019t be excessively concerned about a company\namassing a great amount of\npower. Because companies\nrespond to shareholders, and\ntheir ultimate goal is to make\nmoney. That keeps them in\ncheck. Large companies are\nless scary when you know\nwhat they ultimately want.\nBut something changed last\nmonth. Most people didn\u2019t\nreally notice, but Zuckerberg\npublished a manifesto entitled\n\u201cBuilding a Global Community\u201d. Go have a look. It is\nextremely political, but in such\na subtle way that Zuckerberg\nprobably didn\u2019t even notice\nhimself. Quoting the piece:\n\u201cOur greatest opportunities\nare now global \u2013 like spreading prosperity and freedom,\npromoting peace and under-standing, lifting people out of\npoverty, and accelerating sci-ence. Our greatest challenges\nalso need global responses \u2013\nlike ending terrorism, fighting\nclimate change, and preventing pandemics. Progress now\nrequires humanity coming\ntogether not just as cities or\nnations, but also as a global\ncommunity.\u201d What\u2019s unsettling\nabout this piece, in a slight but\nvery clear way, is the tone.\nThe political tone it reeks of.\nAnd okay, I do have to admit\nthat I agree with some of the\nstuff. Maybe I agree about\nthis whole idea of going from\nnations into a global commu-nity. But that\u2019s not the problem.\nThe problem is that this is the\nmost political statement a company could ever make. And\nFacebook being Facebook,\nwith its monopoly of a network\nof two billion people, is arguably the most powerful company\nin the world. The power its\nnewsfeed has had to slightly\naffect our emotions without us\neven noticing (we know this\nhelped you in the election,\nDonald) is massive. And Zuckerberg is the youngest man in\nthe top ten Forbes list of bil-lionaires. There\u2019s bound to be\na point up there where money\ndoesn\u2019t matter to him anymore.\nAnd Zuckerberg\u2019s got years of\npower ahead of him. Just add\nto the cocktail all the recent\nchanges Zuckerberg\u2019s made\nto the corporate structure to\nhave even more control. There\ncomes a point where too much\npower is concentrated.\nSo, Donald, now that I have\nconvinced you, how do we pick\na fight with Facebook? The first\nthing on the list would be to\nintroduce a law that prohibit\nmergers and acquisitions of\nlarge social networks. No more\nFacebooks buying Instagrams.\nWith this law you can also,\nretroactively, make Facebook\nspin off both Instagram and\nWhatsapp (yes, retroactively:\nyou\u2019re going to love being\nthis big, powerful bully). And\nfinally, you make it compulsory for all social networks to\nenable network portability,\ni.e. being able to move your\nlist of friends from one social\nnetwork to another (which\n\\\\ The 'network\neffect' is a winner-takes-it-all game.\nIf it wasn't,\nGoogle+ would\nhave probably\nsucceeeded \\\\\nis something Facebook took\nadvantage of, as you could\nfrom the start import all your\nmail contacts, Yahoo contacts\nand Twitter contacts to Facebook, but never the other way\naround). This way, you prevent\nlarge monopolies forming, you\nenable smaller players to be\nable to compete and bring new\nideas. The result? A much more\ninnovative and decentralised\nSilicon Valley.\nWe all know how much you\nlove to pick a fight. So here you\ngo \u2013 this is a reasonable but\nepic battle to pick.\nT\nhe triple penalty that Muslim\nwomen face \u2013 for being a\nwoman, for being a Muslim\nand often for being of an ethnic\nminority group \u2013 has never been\nmore prominent. Muslim women\nare no longer just at the disadvantage of\nbeing subconsciously seen as inferior to\nother candidates for a potential job, but\nare now being turned away and even, in\nsome cases, dismissed from their careers.\nThe European Court of Justice (ECJ) has\nruled that companies are entitled to ban\ntheir staff from displaying \"any political,\nphilosophical or religious sign\u201d which\nincludes (but is not limited to) turbans,\nskullcaps and the hijab. However, it must\nalso be stated that the ECJ also includes\nthat customers cannot demand a removal\nof such religious expressions if the company itself doesn\u2019t disbar their staff from\ndoing so. Whilst the latter sounds promis-ing, it doesn\u2019t negate the fact that the ECJ\nhave essentially permitted companies to\nnot only hold but enforce their discriminatory views against any display of faith.\nFran\u00e7ois Fillon, a presidential candidate\nof France, claims that this ruling is \u201ca factor\nin cohesion and social peace\u201d. However,\nwhilst it is true that seeing fewer women in\nhijab may avoid the discomfort of a few, it\ncreates mass tension between the Muslim\ncommunity and law enforcers. Such unease\nbetween the two communities will ultimately have detrimental effects, creating\ndisharmony and a lack of faith in the law.\nIn response to the two publicised cases of\nMuslim women being dismissed from their\njobs for refusing to remove their hijab, the\n\\\\ The hijab is pivotal to a\nsense of identity to so many of\nthose who choose to wear it \\\\\nECJ stated that the ban \u201cdoes\nnot constitute direct discrimination\u201d. I, however, am unable to\nconsider a case that is more\nobviously an example of \u201cdirect\ndiscrimination\u201d. Turning anybody away for the practice of\ntheir faith, especially one that\ncannot and will not detriment a\nperson\u2019s ability to perform in a\nrole, is a discriminatory act and\nshould be seen as nothing less.\nIt is also important to note\nthat while the hijab, like any\nother religious garment, is primarily a religious requirement,\nit is also integral to the sense\nof identity of so many of those\nwho choose to wear it. Removing the ability for anybody to\npractise their faith while working in their preferred profession\nis counterproductive to the\nsocial movement of freedom\nthat is so heavily advertised\nwith the modern age of the 21st\ncentury. The reality is that we\nare starting to skew towards\na society where bigotry is not\nonly accepted, but is being presented as justifiable by many\nwho hold powerful positions.\n\\\\ We are starting\nto skew towards a\nsociety where bigotry\nis not only accepted,\nbut is being presented\nas justifiable \\\\\nA\ns I saw the\nheadline a\nsigh left my\nchest. \u201cEU\nWo r k p l a c e\nH e a d s c a r f\nBan Can Be Legal\u201d. Contrary\nto the title, the law is to be\nequally enforced onto all\nreligious signs, whether it is the\nturban, crucifix or skull cap, as\nmentioned within the article.\nThis whole situation is fairly\nlaughable. They paint these\n\"religious signs\" as disposable\nobjects carried or worn by\nthose with religious beliefs. A\nheadscarf, forming part of my\nhijab, isn\u2019t something I put on\nin the morning because I\u2019m\nhaving a bad hair day, nor is\nit something I take off at the\nend of the day because I can\nfinally be bothered to brush\nmy hair. It is part of me; it\nencompasses the very essence\nof my beliefs, without which I\nwouldn\u2019t be who I am.\nThe same applies for\nother religious items such as\nthe dastaar (turban) worn\nby Sikhs. Not only does it\nportray an image of equality\nand respect (amongst many\nother things) but makes up a part of their\nidentity. How is it that, despite our endless\ntechnological advancements, our mindsets\nseem to be regressing? As a society,\nwe\u2019re constantly encouraging children\nto develop their own views, opinions,\nlikes and dislikes \u2013 to be unique. But with\npolicies like these, are we not contradicting\nour own teachings? \u2018Robotising\u2019 workers\nto look a certain way, to act a certain\nway, in a desperate attempt to ensure\nthat we remain within the confines of\nwhat society is comfortable with seeing.\n\\\\ It is part of me;\nit encompasses the\nvery essence of my\nbeliefs, without which\nI wouldn't be who I\nam \\\\\n\\\\ The hijab debate resurfaces\nevery so often, but why?\nWomen should be allowed\ntocover up as much as they\nshow skin, whether it is for\nreligious reasons or not \\\\\nWhat message are we really sending?\nThe hijab debate resurfaces every\nso often, but why? Women should be\nallowed to cover up as much as they\nare allowed to show skin, whether it is\nfor religious reasons or not. How many\ntimes will Muslim women need to repeat\nthe same arguments before it has any\neffect? Especially since my wearing a\nheadscarf does not impose on anybody\nelse's rights, beliefs or behaviour. It's just\nme doing me. Whilst it is sad that the law\nhas allowed workplaces to enforce this\nlaw, I have enough faith in organisations,\nthose deemed 'top employers' at the very\nleast, to not actively implement it. The\nvery organisational values of diversity\nand inclusion that form the backbones of\nmost CSR and Careers departments of\nmost firms can now really be proved or\ndisproved based on their stances.\n\\\\ The power its\nnewsfeed has to\nslightly affect our\nemotions without\nus even noticing\n(we know this\nhelped you in the\nelection, Donald) is\nmassive \\\\\n\n"
