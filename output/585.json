However may I congratulate you on the manner\nwith which you captured the\nsalts t any of Capt Lindley \"s(R X Retd) remarks.\nIn my opinion, as an assistant\nat one of the exhibits. I thought\nthat the event was a complete\nHop. In order lo understand how\nand why this utter failure occurred the following questions\nshould be asked oft he appropriate\nCollege authorities.\n1. Does any one seriously think that such an obvious propaganda exercise will exert\nthe least in ll ue ncc on organisations such as the Knights b rid gc associa it on when It comes to\nfuture College planning applications.'2. How many local residents\nattended the event?\n.'5. How many letter of thanks\nwere received afterwards?\n4. Can anyone provide a full\nanalysis ol the cost ol the event?\ni.e. what was the cost for the\nflowers, the posters, handouts,\nfood and (not very good) wine,\nthe overtime of the stall kept on\nlate. And last, but by no means\nleast, an estimate of the cost ol\nthe time put into the event by\nmembers of the academic and\nnon-academic stall and research\nstudents, II these figures cannot\nbe provided, why not?\n5. What was the cost of specially importing cleaners to\n( lean the stairs in the main Sherfield Building?\n6. What was the cost of printing the invitations?\n7. How many outside cars\narrived for the event for which a traffic warden was specially provided?\n8. At which entrance to the\nCollege was Mark Carlisle supposed to arrive and which\nentrance did he actually arrive?\n9. How long did Mark( Carlisle\nhave to wait while people looked\nfor his car?\n10. Does anyone think that\nMark Carlisle was s ii lf ici ent ly impressed with the efficiency of\nthe event to make him change his\nmind on College cuts.'\n11. How many invitations were sent out?\n12. How mam acceptances\nwere received?\n13. Did the answer lo question\n12 suggest to anybody that the\nevent should be cancelled?\n1 4. Who decided thai i lie\nevent should begin at ():()()?\n15. Who decided that no loo d or drinks should be served until\nan hour and three quarters alter\nthe event began?\nHi. Was it thought that the\nexhibits were of such stunning\ninterest that people would be\nmes meri sed for 105 minutes without nourishment?\n17. Whose responsibility will\nit be to decide whether or not\nthere will be another event of this\ncharacter in the future?\n) mm sincerely\nThe Sherfield Mole PS: I happen to know the answers to some of the questions.\nDear Sir\nIn pursuit of the matter raised\nin last week's letters page by Mr A Ri/.vi, I would like to in l brm any interested readers thai as a Beit Hall( mixed. 40% women)\nresident, I recently found, slipped\nunder my room door, a questionnaire addressed to \"Residents of\nMixed Halls\" intended for the\nguidance of the Student Residence Committee.\nAssuming that this questionnaire is not three months late\nbeing circulated, the S RC are to\nbe commended for the promptness\nof their response to the outcry\nabout the decision taken on bow\nHalls should be mixed. However,\nthere are a lew things about il\nwhich I would like to point out.\nOne is first asked ones sex and\none'sHall of Residence, then,\nand I quote \" Bearing in mind the\ncomposition of IC\" to rate the\nproportion of females in ones\nresidence on a scale from \" much too high\" to \" much too low\", and finally, in one's own opinion\n(and \"Please inform us il anyone\ntries to influence your response\"\n\u2014 is there a mafia around College I hadn't heard ol?) to say\nwhether the present ratio is ideal,\nor very unacceptable, or somewhere in between.\nWell, surely one's answer to\nthe last question is a direct consequence ol his answer to the\nquestion above it. and is as such\nredundant, and. more important-ly, ones answer to the above.\nmost significant, question, given\nthe phrase \" Bearing in... ol IC\nquoted above, ceases lo I)*' one ol\npersonal opinion but one based,\non the contrary, purely on fact\nrendering ibis question redundant also.\nSo. this leaves one to answer\nI lie first two questions, and I think I hat I he S RC's initial request lor only one response to\neach is most unfair to those ol us\nwho may be unsure of their sex or\nwho may perchance inhabit l our residences simultaneously.\nI would therefore, sir. like to\ncomplain.\nl ours w eternal praise oj ic nm cn, Mark Komondouros\nMalhs I Dear Sir\nWe are writing to you because,\nlor the second week running it\nhas been discovered (hat decisions concerning student hall\naccommodation for next year\nhave been taken by College authorities and ICU without prior consultation with those\nmost directly involved \u2014 the\nstudents and those concerned with running t he halls in question.\nApparently it has been decided\nto merge Selkirk/ Ti zard and K co gh Falmouth following the\nearly retirement of the Keogh\nWarden and subsequent non-renewal of contract ol fe red to\nSelkirk Warden. The Warden of\nTi zard will now be responsible\nfor Selkirk, and the Warden of\nFalmouth will be responsible for\nKeogh.\nWhile we in no way question\nthe ability of the Wardens concerned, we would like to\nmake the point that in view ol the\nspecial situation ol small halls like\nSelkirk, we feel that they require\nthe lull attention of just one\nwarden. In the past Selkirk has\nbeen particularly successful in\nproviding a supportive and stimulating environment for the\nstudents allocated to it. Its size\nhas meant that the warden and\nsub warden have been able to\ngive their lull personalised attention to those who need it.\ndirectly assisted by the overall\nconducive social environment engendered by the warden's close\ninvolvement with a small hall.\nThere is a need for such small\nballs in complex College environment with its many demands and pressures placed on\nstudents with varied hard students with varied personal needs and response. No matter\nhow well intention ed or hard\nworking the new overseeing warden is. lie will now have bis\nattention split between two halls.\nThis individual attention will be\nsacrificed for the sake of the tent\ngained on the old warden's fiat.\nWhich is worth more: the well bc ing of students catered Ibr\nby l he special, personalised social\nenvironment of these halls, or a lew thousand pounds a year in\nrent?\nEven il such arguments are\nignored, surely such a merger\nwould be lter be tried out in\nK co gh alone (whose takeover\nwas intended on retirement of the\nwarden anyway), rather than\nsimultaneously now on i he recommendation of ICU. Did they ask us?\nLike the situation complained\nabout in last week's FELIX by\nthe sub warden ol Beit, this is yet\nanother example of the failure of\nthe authorities responsible to\nconsult the opinions of the people\ninvolved, who may have a perfectly valid input to make.\nThis failure is particularly reprehensible on the part ol ICU( who supported the merger) since\nit is they who are supposed to\nrepresent the student interest and\nhave, as on previous occasions,\nsingularly failed to do so.\nJ ours sincerely\nK Baldwin.

    "content": "CND\nor complacency?\nBy Owen Greene\nTHE NUCLEAR arms race has been accelerating\nover the last thirty years and nuclear war now\nseems a probability. The international tensions\nwhich have generated it, and the role of various\nvested interests, are complicated and urgently\nrequire analysis so that people can act to reverse\nthe process before it is too late. Unfortunately,\narticles on nuclear disarmament and C ND are\noften simply a mixture of mystification, pseudo-analysis and complacency. Frank James' 'Soapbox' article in last week's FELIX is just one\nmore example of this.\nFirstly, \"better red than dead\" is not aC ND slogan. Many people think that it contains a grain\nof common sense, but to present it, as Frank\nJames does, as central to CND's position is\nignorant. The rest of the article only boils down to\nare assertion of the views of the military, Reagan,\nThatcher, etc. That is that due to the inherent\nexpansion is m of the USSR, we (i.e.N A TO) must\ncontinue to develop our nuclear arsenal,\nparticularly in Europe and China, in order to\ncontain and deter it. By campaigning against this\npolicy, C ND is accused of making nuclear war\nmore likely. There are so many assumptions,\nomissions and implications to be challenged in\nsuch assertions that I cannot hope to take them\nall up here.\nThe US has always been in the lead in the\nnuclear arms race. Although the USSR has\nrecently caught up in terms of the total explosive\npower of its missiles, the US is still years ahead in\nterms of technological sophistication and accuracy. Since the US had several years head\nstart, has always spent at least as much as Russia\non nuclear weapons, and has a more highly\ndeveloped economy and skilled workforce, it\nwould be amazing if this wasn't the case. The\npresent phase in the ex al ation has largely been\nthe responsibility of NATO. I neither admire or\ntrust the USSR and condemn the invasion of\nAfghanistan, etc, etc, but facts are facts.\nBoth sides had the capability to obliterate a large proportion of the others population by the\nearly 1960s, and yet the race continued.\n\"Deterrence\" has been obsolete as a meaningful\njustification for over a decade, and is now only\nretained for its propaganda value. This was\nofficially confirmed around 1975 with the\nSchlesinger doctrine and Presidential Directive\n59. Nuclear war is now not only think able in the\nstrategist's mind but also maybe \"winn able\". NATO is now prepared to use nuclear weapons\nfirst in conflict (i.e. \"flexible response\"). The aim\nis to limit the holocaust to the European \"theatre\". This would clearly involve the total\ndestruction of European civilisation but the US might survive relatively intact with only\nacceptable losses (up to about 20 million deaths).\nSuch a strategy holds little attraction for the\nUSSR since its obliteration would be certain.\nMost of Western Europe is littered with NATO nuclear weapons, nearly all of which are entirely\nunder US control. It is in this context that C ND, along with many other disarmament movements\nin Europe, is campaigning for unilateral nuclear\ndisarmament. Since over 70% of NATO's nuclear\nwarheads are in submarines it is silly to suggest\nthat such disarmament would leave the West with\nno \"deter ent\". However it would certainly force\nstrategists to abandon the idea of a \"theatre\" war\n\"limited\" to Europe.\nFrank James can't even find room to pay the\ncustomary lip service to multilateral negotiations.\nTo those who do pin their hopes on them, I ask\nyou to reflect on why they have failed up till now.\nUnilateralists fully accept the crucial role\nmultilateral agreements will ultimately play in\nsecuring world nuclear disarmament, but\nexperience shows that unilateral actions are also\ncrucial. After all, each step in nuclear armament\nis unilateral. Either way, being a( genuine)\nmultilateral is t means working hard for disarmament too!

Fascinating though these\nexperiments are, the nuclear power programme raises more\nquestions than are answered in\nthe undergraduate physics ease.\nTlie 197(i Royal Commission\non Nuclear Power and the Envionmcnt' (chaired by our own\nSir Brian Flowers) recommended\nthat there be no large sea le expansion ol nuclear power until\nthe problem ol radioactive waste\ndisposal had be-en solved.\nIt has no l. although there are\nhopeful developments in the\nsynthetic rock substitute in which\nto incorporate the waste.

South Africa is probably the\nlate-si country to develop nuclear\nweapons, this being its acknowledged intention: it certainly\nnow has its own reprocessing\nfacilities. Imperial College may\nhave mades its own contribution\nto this disturbing development\nby running a nuclear technology\nionis e with students sponsored\nby the S African government.\nI he economies ol nuclear power do not take into account\nthe unknown costs of decommissioning and waste disposal.\nthe fact that most research and\ndevelopment has been clone\nunder military- budgets (admit-ted ly ibis could be regarded as a spin-off), nor i be government subsidy in taking over most ol the\ninsurance provision lor the\nnuclear industry.

    "content": "Physics Open Day\nFiasco\nThree hundred and fifty sixth former s attended an open day in\nthe Physics department last Friday. The event, organised by\nstudents, was intended to give A Level students interested in\nscience a chance to look at an undergraduate department, and\nwas not intended to be any form of recruiting exercise.\nThe sixth former s were given a chance to see many aspects of student\nlife. Professor Butterworth, Head of Department, gave a short\nwelcoming speech, which was followed by a talk on studying physics at\nIC by the departmental rep, Mark Gillett. To give a general view of\nstudent union activities, ICU Hon Sec, Liz Lindsay, also gave a speech.\nThe most interesting part of the visit was probably the tour of first\nyear laboratory projects. These are prepared every year in the\ndepartment as part of the first year lab course and are normally\ndisplayed to students and stall' of the College. The display was\nextended to a second day to allow the sixth former s to witness the wide\nvariety oi topics covered. These ranged from studies of microprocessor\nand laser applications to biophysics, and even included a fascinating\nreconstruction of \"Practical Physics\" in the nineteenth century. There\nwere some fifty projects in all.\nTo give a wider view of undergraduate life a short lecture on\nastronomy was also included in the programme.\nThe open day was considered a great success by stall and students\nalike and is likely to be repeated ne xl year.\nTen Tors\nFiasco\nRag Fete\nFiasco\nICU's ANNUAL RAG Fete took\nplace last Saturday afternoon on\nthe Queen's Lawn.

    "content": "Well Hung!\nOVER THE EASTER Bank Holiday weekend, the\nwind was a moderate easterly and the sky was\nblue with a few scattered clouds. Perfect weather\nconditions to go flying at Pandy in South Wales. I had also borrowed one of the new fifth generation\nhang gliders for the weekend and set off early to\nWales with it strapped down to the roof-rack.\nWhen we arrived I rigged up quickly and was in\nthe air in forty minutes having launched from an\n800ft spur that sticks out from the end of the\nridge. The glider felt superb and I soon gained\n1,000ft above take off and was heading out along\nthe seven miles of barren Welsh mountains that\nlay between myself and \"the Gap\". This is an\nup wind jump of about a mile which has to be\ncrossed before reaching the end of the ridge. I had been forced to land there two days earlier\nand I made sure of crossing it with a ground\nclearance of 2600ff. The end of the ridge was Hay Bluff. A huge\nbarren block with vertical faces chopping 1,500ft on all sides. 1 flew along its NE face for a half an\nhour just beating backwards and forwards, feeling\nthe way I was thrown around in the air as a thermal came through and learning how to circle\nin the region of best lift. I was joined by another\npilot and soon after a huge thermal came through\nand we both circled back over the Wye Valley\nand away from Hay Bluff which grew smaller and\nsmaller below me.\nAt 3,500ft I set off downwind and glided five\nmiles to Telgarth where I picked up another\nthermal and lazily corkscrewed into the now\nperfectly blue sky up to 4,000ft. I could just see\nbelow me the other glider landing, he had left the\nthermal too soon and had been caught in the\nsurrounding downdraft.\n1 flew off down wind in search of my third\nthermal but this time things were not so easy. The\nlift was weaker and I circled for thirty minutes\ndrifting downwind slowly covering the miles. 1 was\nagain getting low and was desperate to find some\nmore lift....but no....I had to choose a landing field\nclear of pylons but near habitation. I found one\nthree miles south of Brecon and on landing 1 was\nmet by three amazed local farmers who gave me\nlocal cider and let me phone for my pick-up.\nThe twenty five miles from Pandy to Brecon via\nTelgarth had taken me over two and a half hours\nspending most of the time over 2,000ft above the\nvalleys below.\nSurely no other human experience could more\nclosely approach bird like flight.\nBruce Goldsmith\nC&G Motor Club\nLAST THURSDAY EVENING, the club held its\nannual dinner at the Schooner Inn in Panton St\n(breaking the tradition of Mooney meals). The\nevent went exceptionally well and everybody\nenjoyed it enormously (especially those who\ncollected prizes for winning various Motor Club\nevents). There were in fact forty-five people\npresent (we counted them!\u2014or was it 46?)\nUndoubted star of the evening was Mr Ian\nBracey, the guest speaker, this after dinner\nspeech commanded the attention of everyone in\nthe room and tears of laughter were visible in\nmany an eye. His speech started by dealing with\nthe early days of his career. After leaving school\nwith 'the best education money could buy' and\ntwo O Levels, he built his first racing machine, the\n'Tiger Strike' where the driver's head was the\nback of the car and his feet the front, with the\nengine mounted alongside. Mr Bracey then went\non to recount some of the more amusing events\nthat befell him while racing the car, concluding\nwith its demise when he got a lap ful of red hot\nengine remains.\nProgressing to his fortunes at Le Mans (the\nmost prestigious race in the world) he related his\nproblem of torn loyalties in the year of the\nQueen's Jubilee. Deciding to go to Le Mans he\ntook with him a22ft flag pole in sections which he\nduly raised in the paddock on arrival. Having\ntaught himself to play the bugle, he pro ceded to\nceremoniously raise and lower the flag at the\nbeginning and end of each day. This infuriated the\nFrench who never like to be outdone on the\npatriotic front, especially by the British!\nIn short, Ian Bracey is an Englishman of the\ntrue tradition and is a credit to his country. On a ridiculously small budget, he has held his own in a British car against the might of the factory teams\nsuch as BMW, Porsche and Renault. On behalf of\nthe Motor Club and College as a whole we would\nlike to wish him the best of luck in this year's 'Le\nMans 24 Hours'.\nJohn Uedy and Mike Harrison\nSF Soc\nNovJ tor one final climactic paragraph as the SF\nSoc bulletin pushes ever onward, further up and\nfurther in. As our secretary once said, \"It's the\nhandfuls of fruit that bother me\". Our library has\nexpanded beyond belief. Not only have we\nbought fourteen new books, but we have placed\nthose we already have further apart. There will be\nno library meetings until further notice. So long\nfolks, here's waving dangerous flags at you.\nLucas Aid and Call-me-Kenneth\nStephenson Cup\nFOLLOWING THEIR 2-1 massacre of Guilds,\nRCS met Mines last Wednesday. The result\nwas a humiliating experience for Mines, the\npresent holders of the Stephenson Cup. Although the half-time score was 0-0, RCS had dominated the game, attacking continuously. Only good defence by Gatley, Newman\nand some othe r guy saved Mines from\nconceding several goals.\nThe second half saw the continued plight of\na besieged Mines side. For*un at ely, for Mines,\nthe pressure was relieved when RCS retreated to the half-way line following ar\nexcellently worked free-hit just outside the\n'D'. Parker and Hughes working together '.o produce a good shooting chance for Cope,\nthe shot although saved was slipped to\nSharpe, who duly drilled the ball home.\nThe game then became deceptively even,\nas RCS slacked off, but RCS clinched the\ngame, when a shot by Taylor was half saved\nby the goalkeeper. But a bit of GB H on the\ngoalkeeper by Hughes eventually resulted in\nthe ball hitting the back of the net. But no one\nquite knows who scored; although general\nsympathy was in favour of Taylor.\nRCS' s triumphant return to IC was somewhat alcoholic, although John Daving\ninsisted that the minibus was only weaving\nbecause of the steering.\nTEAM: Cape, Sharpe, Parker, Taylor,\nHughes, Williams, Moran, Leinster. Riley,\nFarrington, Rogers.\nFootball\nTHE CLUB has had its most successful season ever with five of our six teams winning\ntheir divisions and the thirds coming fifth in\nthe same division as the seconds. The fifths\nalso won their cup, beating LSE IV 1-0 in the\nfinal at Motspur Park.\nI should now have the cups and medals and\nplayers who have won them should see me as\nsoon as possible (Union Office, lunchtimes)\nto collect them. We will be having a few drinks\nin the Union Bar on Tuesday evening, May 26,\nwhen the silverware will be on show and\nmedals will be available.\nOur firsts have been invited to play in a' charity shield' match against RH C at\nMotspur. Anyone who would like to come\nalong and support should put their name on\nthe list on the Club Noticeboard just outside\nthe Bar. If there is enough interest the coach\nwill leave at about 2:00pm on Wednesday,\nMay 27.\nCongratulations to Mines2 nd XI for\nwinning Division 4R and many thanks to all\nthe people who ensured the club's success\nthis season.\nSteve Veats\nSnooker\nTHE DYNAMIC new Committee are now\ngradually taking over in preparation for a tremendous, fun-filled, record-breaking time\nnext year, so be prepared.\nThe doubles champions are Proudlove and\nTrip p, and just to be boring, they have\ndecided to contest the open final between\nthemselves as well. The really interesting\ntournament, the Handicap, seems to be\nprogressing slowly, so stop revising (??) for a moment and go and find your opponent. Put\na notice up on one of the boards if you're not\nsure who he is, and arrange a time, or face\nimmediate and complete disqualification.\nFELIX, May 22, 1981 Page 7\n\n"
