As I typed away on my\nlaptop, making notes from articles\nand reading up on the subject I\nasked myself \u2013 \u201cwhat about the\nclimate?\u201d Everyone who is anyone\nwith any real information knows\nclimate change is happening so\nwhat more is there to write about?\nI lay my palms on the table and\nsigh\u2013 the research hadn\u2019t given me\nthe momentum I hoped for, and\nnow I had hit the proverbial cul-de-sac. I thought about the issue,\nread most of this month\u2019s issue of\nthe National Geographic magazine,\nsolely dedicated to climate change ,\nand sunk further into my chair. To\nsum up climate change discussions\nin a nutshell: interesting statistics,\nthe science which proves climate\nchange is occurring, utilising\nrenewable energy sources, climate\nchange\u2019s impact, and initiatives to\ncombat this. I knew the facts, but\nI didn\u2019t really have much to say. I\nonce heard someone comment that\npeople who don\u2019t make good writers\nare those that didn\u2019t have anything\nto say. So I reflected \u2013 what could\nI say?\nI asked myself why I was sitting\ntrying to write but not finding\nmuch inspiration. And the answer?\nI like writing, but I was forcing it.\nI realised that of all the things that\nI\u2019ve tried to do, writing has come\nmost easily \u2013 it has always been a\npleasure. It\u2019s my experience with\nwriting that I would like to share.\nIn this day and age where we\u2019re so\ncaught up in our own lives, under\nthe stress of deadlines, of work,\njobs, job applications and constantly\nbeing plugged into our phones, it is\nimportant to find time for yourself.\nWe\u2019ve all been moulded to be cogs\nin the \u2018system\u2019 and arguably have\nhad some of our creativity beaten\nout of us in the process.\nBut it\u2019s creativity and imagination,\nand the effort to keep it alive that is\nthe struggle. I would recommend\nwriting for the very reason that it is\na means to keep your imagination\nalive. It is a great stress reliever,\nwhere you\u2019re able to take what\u2019s on\nyour chest, place it on paper and\nrid yourself of your burdens. In our\nlives it\u2019s important to have coping\nmechanisms, but more importantly\nmechanisms to live sustainably and\nsatisfactorily. Words are symbols\nwhich express our thoughts and\nfeelings and there is a certain beauty\nin being able to say something and\nfor people to know exactly what\nyou mean. Sometimes these words\nhelp you understand what your\nthoughts when thinking about a\nsubject or problem. Putting things\ndown on paper can help you order\nyour mind. It is also an attempt to\ngive expression to thoughts and\nfeelings you know, but can\u2019t quite\nconvey even to yourself. From\nmy anecdotal experience, with\nregards to many people\u2019s feelings or\nproblems, it is being able to express\nthem that legitimises them. Before ,\nits expression it is simply a passing,\nunimportant thought, but when\nyou hear or read it expressed you\nrealise you had a legitimate point.\nOr you realise that you actually have\na problem which needs to be dealt\nwith.\nWe live in a time where depression\nis a big issue. Pressures at university\ncan drive us up the wall. Having\nto cram information, trying to\nunderstand complex mathematics\nfrom PowerPoint slides, pressures\nof exams, friends and that is just\nwithin our own immediate life, let\nalone the evil and sadness caused\nby poverty, hunger, war, and racism\namong many other things. A lot of\ntimesweneedareleaseinjusttalking\nabout things but for one reason\nor another we can\u2019t. Repression\nis the worst thing anyone can do\nbecause the frustration builds up.\nSeek help, but for your deepest\nsecrets and thoughts which you\u2019re\nnot ready to reveal, writing it on\npaper can act as a stepping stone\nto getting professional help and\ntalking about it. Having written it\ndown, this can have the effect of\nhelping you articulate your issue\nbetter. Sometimes you may think\nWriting as a release\npeople won\u2019t take you seriously, but\nif you can explain your situation\nand feelings better it will help.\nAt other times when you have an\nissue you know there is something\nwrong because you feel stressed\nor demotivated, but you crucially\ndo not accept that something is\nwrong because you cannot express\nit.Writing can help in its expression\nand thus self-realisation of the\nissue. It\u2019s certainly helped me to get\nthings straight in my head, identify\nthe source of issues and be able to\narticulate them correctly.\nSo I would recommend that you\nfind a hobby, release or outlet . It\nmay be sport, reading, arts and\ncrafts, or something else entirely.\nBut if you haven\u2019t found one yet, or\nwant to try something new, pick up\na pen and maybe you\u2019ll find writing\nis what you had been looking for the\nwhole time.\nIf you find you quite like it, we have a place for you here at FELIX.

I challenge its fans to\nwatch it again today, and tell me it\u2019s\naged well. Yes, there are some iconic\nscenes,but this is not because they\u2019re\ngood \u2013 rather it\u2019s because the film\nwas popular. What we have here is\na serious case of nostalgia goggles.\nHere are some alternatives:\nRaging Bull (1980)\nThe better film about an ItalianAmerican underdog boxer, Raging\nBullisRockywithoutthemelodrama.\nScorsese replaces Avildsen, and\nDe Niro \u2013 in his best role bar The\nGodfather 2 \u2013 replaces Stallone.\nIt\u2019s a bit like that scene in Shaun of\nthe Dead where the cast meet their\nsuperior alternate versions. Raging\nBull isn\u2019t an easy watch but there\u2019s\na reason people have written whole\nbooks about it.\nThe Wrestler (2008)\nAnother film I could write about\nfor years, The Wrestler is one of\nDarren Aronofsky\u2018s best films.\nThe backstory here is interesting\nenough, with Mickey Rourke\nmaking a return to cinema after\nhuge issues with drugs and plastic\nsurgery. His story is reflected in that\nof the main character Randy \u201cThe\nRam\u201d Robinson, whose tale is one\nof a washed-out ex-wrestler and\nhis attempts to reconnect with his\ndaughter whilst resisting the lure of\na comeback.\nSpace Jam (1996)\nSpace Jam may not be a work of\ncinematic mastery like Raging Bull\nor The Wrestler but damn it\u2019s still an\namazing film.The ridiculous pairing\nof Michael Jordan and the Looney\nTunes is one only the greediest and\nmost brilliant of film companies\ncould think up. More intelligent\nthan one would think, the film\nis genuinely funny in parts. The\nquestion is, does me liking this film\nfor mostly nostalgic reasons make\nme a hypocrite considering my\nthoughts on Rocky? A little bit, but\nto be fair Space Jam\u2019s theme song is\nway better.\nBEN COLLIER\nThe cinema is an instrument of\npoetry\nThis week sees the start of a retrospective of Luis Bu\u00f1uel, the\nradical Spanish filmmaker, at London\u2019s ICA. We take a look at the\ndirector\u2019s life and work, identifying the key themes at play in his\nfilms: sexuality, satire, and surrealism\nL\nuis Bu\u00f1uel Portol\u00e9s was a\nSpanish filmmaker who\nworked in Spain, Mexico,\nand France. Born in 1900,\nat the very beginning of the new\ncentury, he lived to witness two\nworld wars, as well as the liberation\nof Spain from Francisco Franco\u2019s\n36-year-long dictatorship, before\nhis death in 1983.\nConsidered to have been a leader\nof avant-garde surrealism in his\nearly years, Bu\u00f1uel was a dominant\nfigure in international filmmaking,\noften regarded as a moralist and\nrevolutionary. His career lasted 48\nyears, spanning from 1929 to 1977,\nwith his work exploring nearly\nevery genre in film, yet despite this\nversatility, his films possess certain\ntraits that clearly distinguish him\nas an auteur. One such trait was his\nhighly functional and uncluttered\nhe would put on for friends at the\ntime, by projecting shadows on\na screen using a bedsheet and a\nmagic lantern \u2013 an object which\nalso evoked Ingmar Bergman\u2019s\nfilmmaking talent.\nIn 1917 Bu\u00f1uel enrolled at the\nUniversity of Madrid for a degree\nin agronomy, but switched to\nindustrial engineering, and then\nfinally to philosophy. It was there\nthat he would meet and develop\nintimate relationships with painter\nSalvador Dal\u00ed and poet Federico\nGarc\u00eda Lorca, the three of them\nforming the core of the Spanish\nsurrealist avant-garde. During\nhis student years, Bu\u00f1uel became\nan accomplished hypnotist: in\nfact, he insisted that the darkness\nof the theatre and the rapidly\nchanging scenes, lights and camera\nmovements, weaken the spectator\u2019s\nJeanne Rucar, whom he married in\n1934.\nHis first picture, Un Chien\nAndalou, was made at the very\nend of the silent era, in 1929. It\nis a 16-minute short, which he\nco-wrote and directed with Dal\u00ed,\nbased on a dream each of them had\nhad, extremely Freudian in nature;\nthe two deliberately contrasted\nEpstein\u2019s approach to filmmaking\nby deliberately making a point of\neliminating all logical associations\nfrom the narrative. \u201cHistorically,\u201d\nhe wrote, \u201cthe film represents a\nviolent reaction against what in\nthose days was called \u2018avant-garde\u2019,\nwhich was aimed exclusively at\nartistic sensibility and the audience\u2019s\nreason.\u201d Alas, unfortunately for\nBu\u00f1uel, the film was a huge success\namong the French bourgeoisie!\nDue to a clash between Dal\u00ed\u2019s\neccentric, but nonetheless rightist,\nideology and Bu\u00f1uel\u2019s strong leftist\nsympathies, his first feature film,\nL\u2019Age d\u2019Or \u2013 originally meant to\nbe a collaboration between the two\n\u2013 ended up being shot entirely by\nBu\u00f1uel himself.Completed in 1930,\nDal\u00ed proclaimed the film was a\nvisual style, with an emphasis on\ncharacter-defining elements in the\nshot,and elimination of unnecessary\ndetail. Another was his own \u2018stock\ncompany\u2019 of trusted cast and crew,\nused repeatedly in his productions\n(same way that a score by Danny\nElfman written for a movie\nstarring Johnny Depp screams\n\u2018Tim Burton\u2019). Finally, his repeated\nuse of the traditional drums from\nhis birthplace of Calanda in his\nfilms, have been described as a\n\u2018biofilmographic signature\u2019 of his.\nBu\u00f1uel spent his childhood and\nadolescence in Zaragoza, where he\nreceived a strict Jesuit education.\nBy the time he was 16, however,\nhe came to perceive the Church as\nillogical and had grown disgusted of\nits wealth and power. Perhaps one\nof the first signs of his fascination\nwith cinema, were the \u2018productions\u2019\ncritical intelligence and exercise\nover him a kind of fascination, akin\nto hypnosis.\nThe film that played a catalytic role\nin Bu\u00f1uel pursuing his interest in\nfilm was Fritz Lang\u2019s Der m\u00fcde Tod,\naka Destiny (1921). \u201cImages could\nand did become\u201d, for him, \u201cthe true\nmeans of expression\u201dand he decided\nto devote himself to the cinema. At\nage 72, an ever-enthusiastic Bu\u00f1uel\nasked Lang for his autograph.\nIn 1925 Bu\u00f1uel moved to Paris,\nwhere he decided to enter the film\nindustry, enrolling in a private\nschool run by one of the most\ncelebrated commercial directors in\nFrance at the time, Jean Epstein.\nHe worked for Epstein as assistant\ndirector until 1927, and after that\nhe worked as a film critic,helping to\nestablish Madrid\u2019s first cinema club.\nIt was around that time that he met\ndeliberate attack on Catholicism; it\ncaused such a scandal that the film\nwas withdrawn from circulation,not\nto be seen again until 1979.\nThanks to the succ\u00e8s de scandale,\nBu\u00f1uel spent a short while in\nHollywood working with MGM,\nand associated with iconic figures of\nthe time, such as Sergei Eisenstein,\nJosef Von Sternberg, Charles\nChaplin, and Bertolt Brecht, before\nreturning to pre-Civil War Spain\nin 1932, at a time of political\nand social turbulence. His next\nfilm, Las Hurdes: Tierra Sin Pan,\nfocused on peasant life in Spain,\nand is one of the first examples of\na mockumentary. Bu\u00f1uel was able\nto reconcile his political ideology\nwith his surrealistic aesthetic in\nwhat was labelled as a \u2018surrealist\ndocumentary\u2019. After this, he worked\nin dubbing studios in Paris and\nMadrid, before producing films for\na mass audience with Spanish film\ncompany Film\u00f3fono, insisting that\nhe remain anonymous so that he\nmay preserve his reputation as a\nsurrealist. During the Spanish Civil\nWar(1936-1939),Bu\u00f1uelessentially\nfunctioned as the coordinator of\nfilm propaganda for the Republic;\nthe Spanish Ambassador suggested\nthat he revisit Hollywood, where he\ncould give technical advice on films\nbeing made there about the war,and\nso he did.\nHowever, the National Legion of\nDecency,an organisation combating\ncontent in motion pictures\nobjectionable from the point of\nview of the Catholic Church, saw to\nit that his work in Hollywood was\nleft unfinished. Bu\u00f1uel managed\nto sell some gags to Chaplin for\nThe Great Dictator (1940), but\nwas otherwise unfit for success in\nA parody of The Last Supper in Luis Bu\u00f1uel\u2019s 1961 film Viridiana, which won the Palme d\u2019Or at Cannes Photo Credit: Creative Commons\nHollywood, lacking the arrogance\nand pushiness necessary for it,\naccording to his biographer Ruth\nBrandon.Receiving no interest from\neven independent producers in LA,\nBu\u00f1uel moved to New York, where\nhe worked at the MoMA, gathering\nanti-fascist films to be distributed in\nLatin America.\nFinding himself in Mexico\nin 1946, as the Golden Age of\nMexican cinema was climaxing,\nBu\u00f1uel attempted to learn a thing\nor two about \u2018normal\u2019 cinema.\nTeaming up with \u00d3scar Dancigers,\na Russian \u00e9migr\u00e9 producer active\nin Mexico, he directed the musical\nperiod drama Gran Casino (1947),\nwhich was turned out to be a\ndisaster, perhaps due to Bu\u00f1uel\u2019s\nrusty technical skills after so many\nyears out of the director\u2019s chair. El\nGran Calavera, on the other hand,\na hilarious eccentric satire of the\nMexican nouveau riche, was an\ninstant hit at the box office in 1949.\nBecause of this success, he was able\nto claim more freedom in his next\nfilm project: Los Olvidados (1950).\nHowever,thefilmwastakenbymany\nas an insult to Mexican sensibilities\nand the Mexican nation, with some\neven asking for Bu\u00f1uel\u2019s recently-acquired Mexican citizenship to\nbe revoked. Fearing a complete\nfiasco, Dancigers commissioned\nan alternate \u2018happy ending\u2019 to the\nfilm, but was forced to withdraw\nit after only three days in theatres\ndue to poor attendance. Nobel\nLaureate in Literature Octavio Paz,\nhowever, promoted Los Olvidados\nand Bu\u00f1uel won the Best Director\naward at Cannes Film Fesitval for it.\nBu\u00f1uel remained in Mexico for\nthe rest of his life, completing over\n20 more films by the end of his\ncareer. His first film in colour, also\nhis first in the English language,was\nRobinson Crusoe (1954), followed by\nThe Young One (1960), for which a\nHarlem newspaper even wrote that\nhe should be \u2018hung upside down\nfrom a lamppost on Fifth Avenue.\u2019\nOther films of his that gained\ninternational recognition were \u00c9l\n(1953), Viridiana (1961), Belle de\nJour (1967), and his very last film,\nThat Obscure Object of Desire (1977).\nWhile some consider the majority\nof his work to have consisted of\nfilms adapted to the norms of the\nnational film industry,others believe\nthere is a deceptive complexity\nwithin it, which offers \u2018a sustained\nmediation on ideas of religion,\nclass inequity, violence and desire.\u2019\nHis work indeed often dealt with\nthemes central to his lifelong\nconcerns, such as sexual pathology,\nthe destructive effects of rampant\nmachismo, the blurring of fantasy\nand reality, the disruptive status\nof women in a male-dominated\nculture, and the absurdity of the\nreligious life. Focusing on the films\nBu\u00f1uel produced in Mexico and\nSpain during the 1950s and 1960s,\nJulian Daniel Gutierrez-Albilla\nargues that Bunuel\u2019s films that\nthere are multiple forms of identity,\nsubjectivity and sexuality present in\nthese films.\nIn his 70\u2019s, Bu\u00f1uel once told his\nfriend, novelist Carlos Fuentes: \u2018I\u2019m\nnot afraid of death. I\u2019m afraid of\ndying alone in a hotel room, with\nmy bags open and a shooting script\non the night table. I must know\nwhose fingers will close my eyes.\u2019\nHe died in Mexico City, in 1983.\nDIEGO APARICIO\nIn Bu\u00f1uel\u2019s\nfilms there\nare multiple\nforms of\nsubjectivity\nHis work\nexplores\nnearly every\ngenre in film\nCatherine Deneuve in the French drama, Belle de Jour, directed by Bu\u00f1uel in 1967 Photo Credit: MUBI\nBu\u00f1uel with his then BFF Salvador Dal\u00ed, in happier times Photo Credit: Creative Commons\n\n"

I\u2019ve never gone to the\nballet, and my last brush with opera\nresulted in a 3rd\nact power nap (it was\nfour hours long and in French, just\nsaying). I\u2019ve also never picked up\nShakespeare, let alone sat through\none of his plays. So when Max\nprocured a ticket for Henry V, I took\nthe opportunity and popped my\nShakespearean cherry. As expected\nit was dramatic. (Zing!)\nMany of the cast\u2019s comedic\nperformances were stellar,extracting\ncopious amounts of laughter from\nthe audience, particularly adorably\nfunny Oliver Ford Davies as Chorus,\nJoshua Richards as a chatter-boxy\nFluellen and Jennifer Kirby as an\ninfantile, alas delightful Katherine.\nMost other French parts were also\nhilarious,albeit borderline offensive.\nBut it\u2019s a play about the English\nripping the French a new one,\nwritten in 1599, so I guess I\u2019ll let\nit slide. The audience certainly did,\nas during their performances LOLs\nechoed all round and for a few brief\nmoments, we were transformed\nback to Shakespearean times, where\nthis play would have been executed\nin front of nasty hecklers and gangs\nof riff raff, busy heaving, shoving,\nwinking and smiling. Good times.\nMusic, costumes, sets and effects\nwere similarly brilliant and really\nScience Editor pops Shakespearean cherry\nLef Up\nScience Editor\nThe Royal Shakespeare Company\u2019s Henry V at the Barbican sursprises and delights\nadded to the experience.\nBut performances of the more\nserious dramatic roles, particularly\nthat of Henry V, performed by\nAlex Hassel, were surprising. Sure,\nI\u2019m not a Shakespeare buff, (even\nthough I\u2019ll have you know I have\nwatched both Shakespeare in Love,\nand Anonymous, so I\u2019m somewhat\nof an expert). I was, however,\nexpecting a rendition of king Henry\nas strong, mighty, possibly sporting\na mohawk, kicking ass and taking\nnames, you know, oozing national\npride. Instead I saw a childlike\npsychopath, voice breaking every\nso often, going through emotional\nstates like a nymphomaniac through\nsets of linen. His performance made\nHenry V seem dark, twisted and\npossibly a bit unhinged, which\nis a far cry from what I assume\nShakespeare was aiming for when\ncreating the character, given that\nprobably would have been a capital\ncrime back in good ol\u2019 Elizabethan\nEngland.\nBut I personally liked it, finding it\nan accurate depiction of monarchy.\nSo, if you\u2019d like to see a play\n*SPOILER ALERT* about a\nyoung royal sociopath who gets\nso angry after receiving a box of\ntennis balls from the French prince\nthat he decides to declare war on\nsaid prince\u2019s kingdom, which he\nsomehow miraculously wins and\nproceeds to awkwardly court and\nmarry the French princess (who I\nthink is also his cousin?), then this\nis the play for you.\nVerdict: 7/10 hobnobs*\n*Yes, hob and nob first came\ntogether in Shakespeare\u2019s Twelfth\nNight \u2013 Thanks, Internet.\nUntil 24th\nJanuary at the Barbican\nTickets from \u00a35 for under 25\u2019s\nThere\u2019s something awfully disconcerting about this image \u2013 why no real horse?

A\nrenowned critical darling, the film\nboasts countless awards, including\nthe Academy Award for \u2018Best\nDocumentary Feature\u2019. Despite\nbeing heavily one-sided, it is a\nnear-perfect example of how to\nproduce an informative, campaign-based documentary. While many\nfilms of a similar vein often end\nup incredibly dull and repetitive in\ntheir preachiness,The Cove keeps the\nviewer engaged, and has more than\njust dry facts to keep us hooked.\nThe documentary covers, in\npainful detail, the issue of dolphin\ndrive hunting and whaling in Japan.\nMore specifically, it focuses on an\nisolated cove in Taiji where every\nyear thousands of dolphins are\ncaptured and either taken to be\nsold or slaughtered for meat. The\nmain character, of sorts, is seen\nin Ric O\u2019Barry who is famous for\ntraining the dolphins featured in\nthe television series Flipper, but has\nbecome somewhat of an eco-warrior\nfollowing a series of upsetting\nexperiences I won\u2019t spoil here.What\ngives this movie substance is the\nalmost Oceans Eleven-esque feel of\nthe narrative\u2019s main driving force.\nMuch of the film is dedicated to\nthe crew\u2019s efforts to covertly set\nup surveillance around the bay\nto record, for the first time, the\nslaughter of these dolphins.\nAn expert team is put together\nincluding an electronics professional\nfrom the Canadian Air Force\nand a Hollywood SFX artist who\ndisguises the cameras. The crew\nis seen battling with intimidating\nand relentless Japanese fishermen\nwho attempt to silence and scare\nthem away. The editing, music, and\ncamerawork all crescendo towards\nthe final act in what is a perfectly\ncrafted piece of suspenseful action\nstorytelling \u2013 when we do eventually\nget to see the events of this cove,\nit\u2019s not easy to watch. Other parts\nof the film go about explaining\nvarious aspects of dolphin and\nwhale activism, with talking points\nranging from mercury poisoning,\ncaptivity in SeaWorld, and the\nMinamata-Disease scandal of the\n1960s.\nThe Cove holds a place as one of\nvery few documentaries that have\nmade me question myself and the\nthings I believe and do. When\nI first saw the film as part of a\nshowing with the Wimbledon Film\nClub, the audience was treated to a\nQ&A with a member of the Ocean\nProtection Society. One topic that\ncame up during the discussion was\nthe question of how, if someone is\na meat-eater, could they oppose\nthe killing of these dolphins? This\nquestion stuck with me then, and\nhas done so to this day. As a meat\neater myself, this film was genuinely\nquite emotional and challenging to\nwatch; I would recommend it to\nanyone interested in the topic, or\nindeed any aspects of animal welfare\nactivism.\nFishers in the Taiji cove, where thousands of dolphins are slaughtered Photo Credit: STR/AFP\nAn exploration of the irrational\nWe head down to the opening night of the ICA\u2019s Bu\u00f1uel retrospective, where a\nselection of his key films \u2013 Un Chien Andalou, Eating Sea Urchins, and L\u2019Age D\u2019Or \u2013\ndisplay his mastery of the surreal\nH\nauntingly beautiful,\nwith no linear narrative,\nno clear plot, and no\napparent meaning, the\nfilms of Luis Bu\u00f1uel mark him out\nas a revolutionary director and key\nfigure in the avant-garde surrealist\nmovement. At the Institute of\nContemporary Arts (ICA) a\nretrospective of his work and life,\nbegun with his most popular film,\nUn Chien Andalou (1929), and his\nmost rare film, Eating Sea Urchins\n(1930); a home-movie made at the\nhouse of Bu\u00f1uel\u2019s close companion\nand artistic partner Salvador Dal\u00ed\u2019s,\nit has been seen by relatively few.\nThe ICA, a small intimate venue\njust five minutes from Piccadilly\nCircus, \u201cpromotes and encourages\nan understanding of radical art\nand culture\u201d. The fact they are\nhosting a retrospective on one of\nthe most original filmmakers of all\ntime is therefore no surprise. The\nretrospective, which commenced on\n12th\nNovember and took months to\nput together, aims to cover all the\nkey periods of Bu\u00f1uel\u2019s expansive\nbody of films, and includes\npanel discussions with acclaimed\nacademics, Jean Claude Carriere \u2013\nan Academy Award honoree and\nfrequent collaborator with Bu\u00f1uel\n\u2013 and Diego Bu\u00f1uel, Luis Bu\u00f1uel\u2019s\ngrandson.\nThe opening was initiated with\nEating Sea Urchins; it was the first\ntime even the panelists had viewed\nthis extremely rare film, which\nwas found as recently as 1988 in a\nbiscuit tin at Dal\u00ed\u2019s sisters house.\nMade around the same time during\nwhich Bu\u00f1uel was making L\u2019Age\nD\u2019Or (1930), it is a film wherein\nthe director has made his mark. As\nIngmar Bergman put it: \u201cBu\u00f1uel\nnearly always made Bu\u00f1uel films\u201d\nand this is seen in the general\ndirection and use of recurring\nthemes such as the sea urchin,which\nalso appears in Un Chien Andalou.\nThis was a point the panelists\nfocused on, Jo Evans stating how it\nwas hard to watch it having seen its\nrole in Un Chien Andalou.\nThen it was onto probably the most\npopular of Bu\u00f1uel\u2019s films: Un Chien\nAndalou. Bu\u00f1uel created the film\non the basis that \u201cno idea or image\nthat might lead itself to a rational\nexplanation of any kind would be\naccepted.\u201dThe film,laced with a dark\nhumour typical of Bu\u00f1uel\u2019s films,\nsews together almost completely\nnonsensical scenes with trivial links\nand contains iconic scenes, such as\nthe slitting of the eye in half, which\nstill has the power to shock. Given\nour desensitised society, and the\ntime at which the film was made,\nit is rather incredible. The film was\nintended to be an insult to the\nFrench bourgeoisie, but instead \u2013\nfrustratingly for Bu\u00f1uel \u2013 turned out\nto be a commercial success. Being\naccepted by the masses put him at\nodds with his intended audience \u2013\nthe likes of Andre Breton and other\nsurrealists \u2013 but not excessively,\nsince on completion Luis Bu\u00f1uel\nand co-writer Salvador Dal\u00ed became\nthe first filmmakers to enter the\nsurrealist group founded by Breton.\nFinally the feature film L\u2019Age\nD\u2019Or was screened, wherein you\ncan really see the comic in Bu\u00f1uel:\nbrilliantly funny, the film has a\nstrong satirical undertone that\ncannot be missed. Following the\nfailed attempts of two lovers to\nachieve intimacy, it was Bu\u00f1uel\u2019s\ntake on the absurdities of the\nbourgeois society, and how society\nis oppressed by rules we ourselves\ncreated. Every scene connected\nto the next with subtle ties, slowly\nincreasing in ridiculousness that\nreached an apex near the end when\nthe male protagonist, overtaken\nwith immense jealousy, throws\ninscrutable items out of the window.\nThis rage is then compared to the\ndamnably sinful, as the film cuts to\na disturbing reference to de Sade\u2019s\nnotorious 120 Days of Sodom \u2013\nthe survivors are shown exiting\nthe castle, with one survivor, the\nDuke of Blangis, bearing a striking\nresemblance to Jesus Christ.\nMake of that what you will, but I\npersonally am intrigued enough for\na second watch.\n\u201cStudents come here not\nexpecting them to be so funny\u201d\nRob Stone exclaimed. And I agree\n\u2013 I was taken aback the first time I\nsaw Bu\u00f1uel. There is a tendency for\ndirectors and films associated with\nan art movement as nonsensical\nas surrealism to be considered\npretentious and as something\nmeant for a film thesis, but Bu\u00f1uel\nis genuinely entertaining. Get a\ntaste of Bu\u00f1uel\u2019s satirical surrealism\nat the ICA, and even if you end\nup hating Bu\u00f1uel, at least you\u2019ll\nhave watched a film in a charming\nvenue. \u201cThe best way is to relax, get\nthe humour, and go along with the\nblack comedy. Rather than trying\nto analyse and try and work out the\nmeaning for it.\u201d Stone continued,\n\u201cEmbrace it, and see what happens\nnext!\u201d \u2013 wise words.\nMERYL ANIL\nLuis Bu\u00f1uel: Aesthetics of the\nIrrational is on at the Institute of\nConemporary Arts, until the 6th\nDecember.

And if it\u2019s\ngood, we\u2019ll probably still be mean,\nbut at least someone will have\nlistened to your music.\nCylink\nThis week\u2019s anonymous guest\ncritic had a lot to say about Cylink\nand his EP Dreams. I\u2019m not sure all\nof it was fair.\nD\u2019annyG provides clean vocals on\n\u2018We Don\u2019t Stop\u2019 which turn a well-produced (but rather predictable)\ndeep house track into something\nspecial.\n\u2018Peace of Mind\u2019, on the other\nhand, is brilliantly cinematic. It\u2019s a\nmassive contrast to the other tracks\non the EP, and I\u2019m not sure how\nwell it fits in.\n\u2018Dreams feat. Kefei Hu\u2019 is bold\nand bombastic, an absolute banger.\n\u2018Basskick\u2019 is a bit too over the top,\nfollowing many of the tropes of the\nhouse genre. Cylink has tagged his\nmusic as \u2018Progressive House,\u2019 and\nthis is the track least worthy of this\ndescription. It\u2019s a poor attempt at\nmaking a club-worthy anthem.\nAfter listening to \u2018We Don\u2019t Stop\nfeat. D\u2019annyG\u2019, my guest critic\ndived deep into their past: \u201cThis\none time I took an overnight ship\nfrom Grimsby to the Hook of\nHolland and it was only, like, old\npeople on board. I went into the\nsort of nightclub bit and it was\nus that \u201cIf \u2018Basskick\u2019 was released\nseven years ago when I was like 14\nor 15, I would have banged it out. It\nwould have genuinely been my jam.\u201d\nIt looks like Cylink now has a fan.\nAvailable on SoundCloud\nWillie Rush\n\u2018Epilogue\u2019 is an ambient, jazzy\nsingle. It starts of as simple chill-step, with a synth undulating in the\nbackground. At about the minute\nmark, a cheesy sampled saxophone\ncomes in and the track begins to\nopen up. It gently relaxes back into\nthe ambient tones of the beginning,\nwith soft piano chords, before\nclimaxing once again with a cheeky\nsax.\nWhile it may be little rough\naround the edges, it\u2019s still a good\neffort and perfect for a chilled night\nin. Pick up a beer (or other alcoholic\nbeverage of your choice), and sit\nback and chill with \u2018Epilogue\u2019.\nOne voice in the FELIX office was\nOebus\nIt\u2019s all looking up for Oebus..\nAfter a touring the campus over\nthe last year (even playing a gig in\nMetric), they now find themselves\nin the pages of FELIX.\nA few weeks ago they released\ntheir alt-funk-rock EP, It\u2019s an Oebus.\nI\u2019ll forgive the flat production,\nbecause their music is seriously\ngroovy.\nA few weeks ago I reviewed the\nnew Guitar Hero (you should read\nI would have\nbanged\nit out. It\nwould have\ngenuinely\nbeen my\njam\njust completely empty.

Kefei\nHu\u2019came on in the club \u201c(he) would\nmost definitely turn up.\u201d\nFor what?\nReminiscing once again, they told\nIt\u2019s all\nlooking up\nfor these\nguys,\nthey\u2019ve even\nplayed a gig\nin Metric\nNext week this could be your demo!\nA cheesy\nsampled\nsaxophone\ncomes in\nand the\ntrack begins\nto open up\nless kind: \u201cThere were odd chords, a\nweird dissonance, which came out\nof the blue in a not pleasant to listen\nto way.\u201d\nAvailable on SoundCloud\nFELIX\u2019s game section once in a\nwhile, it\u2019s great), and many of their\nsongs provide the catchy and skilled\nguitars that would be perfect for the\ngame.\nI enjoyed \u2018Hazard Perception\u2019 the\nleast out of the four tracks; their\nattempt at singing along with the\nbeat of the bass guitar and drums\nfelt far too forced.\nGive them a year or two and\nthey\u2019ll be great.\nMystery guest number two said\nthis about the EP: \u201cIt\u2019s sounds like\nsomeone is trying to imitate Jack\nWhite, but is 19.\u201d I\u2019m not really\nsure what he meant.\nAvailable on Bandcamp\nLast year Mentality and Imperial College Union worked together to\nconduct research to identify the levels of stress and causes of poor\nmental health.\nThe results of the survey confirmed that there are high-levels of\nstress at Imperial and that poor mental health is commonplace.\nAs part of the recommendations of the report we are already\nseeing widespread changes being implemented across the\ntraining, including a redesign of Imperial\u2019s Welfare website, and a\nreview of Student Support Services as well as an increase in the\nservices being provided in some areas.\nImperial College Union wants to support students to be able to support their friends and classmates.

The film\nitself was apparently so bad that it\nhad to be remade within two years\nof its release, and so here we are\nwith Steve Jobs. What\u2019s gratifying\nis that it\u2019s been done very, very well\nthis time.\nDeftly executing a rounded story\nwith narrative action that unfolds\nover the course of only three days\nin Jobs\u2019 life, each of them launches\nfor his latest innovation, Steve Jobs\nat once feels relaxed and fast-paced,\nand always engaging. It\u2019s a feat that\ndoes not necessarily require, but is\ngreatly helped by, a script written\nby Aaron Sorkin (writer of The\nSocial Network and Moneyball). It\u2019s\nbeen a while since I\u2019ve seen a film\nperformed in the not-widely-spoken\ndialect of Sorkinese, and as soon as\nthe film\u2019s first conversation began to\nplay out, I felt old, dusty corners of\nmy brain fire up in ways they haven\u2019t\ndone in years. The dialogue is a\nconcoction of his trademark razor-sharp witticisms and arguments that\nconsist of extended monologues as\nintricate as they are brutal; though\nyou may feel as you hear it that this\nis definitely not how real people talk\nregardless of their intelligence, it\u2019s\nso thrilling just to listen to that its\nsurreal nature can immediately be\nforgiven.\nIt may in fact be one of the best\nscreenplays director Danny Boyle\nhas worked with in his career, and\nhe certainly rises to the occasion\n\u2013 while it might be impossible to\nmake a bad film out of a Sorkin\nscript, Boyle has gone a way towards\nmaking a great one. Not only is the\nfilm excellently shot throughout,but\nhis taste for subtle tweaks of style\nthat truly make a film its own come\nthrough in force in Steve Jobs: swells\nof music are never overstated, but\nperfectly placed; flashbacks to early\ndays under a mellow,grainy filter are\nexcellently intercut with present-day\nscenes in crystal clear quality; and\ncostume design is absolutely spot-Michael Fassbender as the dictatorial genius in a turtleneck, in Danny Boyle\u2019s Steve Jobs Photo Credit: Universal Pictures\nTom Stephens\nWriter\nSteve Jobs\nmay be one\nof the best\nscreenplays\nDanny Boyle\nhas ever\nworked with\nDanny Boyle does the Job\nWith a quickfire script and powerful acting, this is the biopic we\u2019ve been waiting for\non, to the point where the audience\ndoes not see Seth Rogen, Michael\nStuhlbarg and Michael Fassbender\nonscreen, but Steve Wozniak, Andy\nHertzfeld and Jobs himself, aging in\nreal time.\nThe main reason that these\ncharacters come so vividly to life\nis not, however, the accuracy of\ntheir appearances, but that the\nperformances in the film are\nuniversally excellent. Seth Rogen\u2019s\ngeeky persona is given a new edge\nand ends up forming a perfectly\nbelievable Woz, Jeff Daniels\u2019\nexperience with Sorkin dialogue on\nTV seires The Newsroom pays off well\nin his turn as ex-Apple CEO Pete\nSculley,and Kate Winslet\u2019s portrayal\nof Joanna Hoffman, Jobs\u2019 \u2018working\nwife\u2019 and lifelong confidant, is one\nof perfectly understated control,\nwith just enough fire to keep him in\ncheck. But this was always going to\nbe the Fassbender show, and what\nSteve Jobs\nDir: Danny Boyle Script: Aaron\nSorkin Starring: Michael\nFassbender, Kate Winslet, Seth\nRogen, Jeff Daniels 122 minutes.\nTangerine\nDir: Sean Baker. Script: Sean Baker,\nChris Bergoch Starring: Mya\nTaylor, Kitana Kiki Rodriguez,\nJames Ransone 88 minutes.\nT\nransgender revenge\ndramedies are somewhat\nhard to come by in a\ncinema. In fact I\u2019m not\nsure many of them exist at all. If you\nneed to bump up your street cred,\nthen,Tangerine will definitely be the\nedgiest film you\u2019ll see this month,\nperhaps this year. Fortunately it\u2019s\ngot enough substance in it that you\ncan get more out of it than just a\ngood story.\nWhen trans sex worker Sin-Dee\nfinishes a four-week stint in jail, she\nfinds out from her friend Alexandra\nthat her boyfriend/pimp has been\ncheating on her.An insane day-long\nchase across Los Angeles ensues\n\u2013 part buddy movie, part revenge\nthriller, part tragedy, part comedy;\nTangerine\u2019s genre mishmash is\nboth a strength and a weakness.\nThere\u2019s an excellently seedy nature\nto the story as it deals with LA\nlow-life, and individual plotlines\nsuch as the struggle of Razmik, an\nArmenian taxi driver and family\nman in too deep with the underbelly\nof prostitution, pack a genuine\nemotional punch. However while\nthe individual performances \u2013 a\nfantastically charged Kitana Kiki\nRodriguez as Sin-Dee, a hilariously\nsassy Mya Taylor as Alexandra, and\na perfect turn by James Ransome\nas the pimp in question, who\ndamn near steals the movie \u2013 keep\nthe dialogue amusing in passing,\nthere are few real laughs in the\nmovie.I can\u2019t decide if the fact that\nTangerine was shot entirely on an\niPhone is impressive or distracting;\nThe cinematography is colourful,\nall-encapsulating, and feels quite\nnaturally lit, but there\u2019s something\nwrong with the graininess of the\nfilm, the uncertainty of the camera\nmovement, and the odd contrast\nand focus.\nWith an in-your-face soundtrack,\nat times distracting camerawork,\nand a thoroughly defiant attitude\ntowards critics of its subject matter,\nTangerine may prove hard to\nswallow for some viewers at first.\nBut with profound moments of\ninsight into its protagonists\u2019 lives,\nand a brace of strong performances\nto boot, it proves to be a rewarding\nexperience to those willing to treat\nit with patience.\nTOM STEPHENS\nA\nn important and at\ntimes genuinely moving\ndocumentary, Warriors\ntells the story of the\nMaasai of Nairobi,how their culture\npromotes FGM,and its ties into the\nAIDS epidemic. In a society where\nthe elders are believed to have a link\nto God, it\u2019s hard for the youth to be\nheard. The solution to this? Form\na cricket team. It sounds odd, and\none does spend most of the film\nwondering how this club is actually\ndoing anything to help, but we do\neventually get an idea, if too late.\nFirstly, cricket gives links to the\nWest: the team works with the\nBritish army to build their pitch,\nand they travel to Lords to take part\nin an amateur competition. All this\ngives the men a different perspective\non their often dogmatic culture, and\nit is this that spurs them to call for\nan end to FGM. Secondly, despite\na fiercely patriarchal society, the\nclub allows men and women to play\ntogether as equals. Much of the film\nis spent following the team as they\ntrain for, and eventually partake in,\ntheir competition.\nThe question,however,is how does\nthis quirky tale of a cricket team fit\nin with the dark themes tackled?\nThe answer: it doesn\u2019t really.The film\nsuffers from an awkward dichotomy\nin its tones, reminiscent of when\na news anchor has to swap from a\nserious story to a feel-good one \u2013\nawkward smile and all. Warriors\nwould perhaps have worked better\nWarriors\nDir: Barney Douglas. Script: Barney\nDouglas. 87 minutes.\nTell Spring Not to\nCome This Year\nDir: Saeed Taji Farouky, Michael\nMcEvoy Editor: Gareth Keogh 83\nminutes.\nT\nell Spring Not to Come\nThis Year is named after\na poem chosen by one\nof its main subjects:\nCommander Jalaluddin of the 3rd\nBrigade of the Afghan National\nArmy (ANA). The poem is a\nreflection on rebirth and renewal\na show it is; you care deeply for\nFassbender\u2019s Jobs, even when he\u2019s\nshouting at innocent writers of code\nor arguing with his long-neglected\ndaughter; you feel his pain when\nhe faces failure and his ravenous\nhunger for success.\nIn its examination of a flawed\ngreat man of the modern age, Steve\nJobs bears significant resemblance\nto the David Fincher-directed The\nSocial Network \u2013 a difficult film to\nhold a candle to, even by Sorkin and\nBoyle\u2019s standards. But although it\nmay not quite have as much instant-classic flair as The Social Network did,\nits stellar script, dazzling direction\nand fantastic performances make it a\nbrilliantly engaging film of the kind\nthat doesn\u2019t come along too often,\nand is very hard to ignore. In fact,\nthis is one of the most justifiable\n\u2018remakes\u2019 of perhaps the entire 21st\ncentury \u2013 and it only took two years\nfor it to come about.\nThe Lady in the Van\nDir: Nicholas Hytner Script: Alan\nBennett Starring: Maggie Smith,\nAlex Jennings, Frances de la Tour\n104 minutes.\nif it either focussed on the team and\n\u2013 more importantly \u2013 its members,\nor as a Horizons-style programme\nfocusing on the problem of FGM\nwith cricket as a brief side point.\nBEN COLLIER\nof a country, and the impossibility\nof such a renewal while the land\nis still full of death. A mournful\npoem, it is in many ways a perfect\nencapsulation of what the film\nwishes to show us.\nDirected jointly by Saeed Taji\nFarouky and Michael McEvoy, the\ndocumentary is an utterly beautiful,\nhaunting piece of cinema. It follows\na year in the lives of the Commander\nand his men after the withdrawal of\nNATO forces,and their work on the\nfrontlines to rid Helmand province\nof the Taliban.\nIt would be easy to focus on the\nbattles \u2013 and clearly there were many,\nwith 31 of the brigade killed in the\ndocumented year \u2013 but, a shot isn\u2019t\nfired until about halfway through\nthe film. The directors instead\nmainly focus on the relationships,\nmotivations, and the frustrations\nof the men of the brigade, painting\na picture of their lives in a country\nthey describe as \u2018ruined\u2019.\nThey do this with considerable\nartistry, masterful cinematography,\nand a poignant score giving a\ncombined effect reminiscent of a\nfairy-tale. But it\u2019s not so removed\nas that \u2013 it\u2019s personal, intensely so,\ndrawing you beside these men and\ninto their everyday experience.\nThe overwhelming emotion of\nthe film is of mourning: the men\nmourn for their shattered country,\nand for their perceived futility to\ndo anything but keep it hanging\ntogether by a thread.A gripping and\nthoughtful documentary, Tell Spring\nNot to Come This Year is essential\nviewing for anyone interested in the\nall too human aftermath of the war\nin Afghanistan.\nTHOMAS CARROLL\nT\nhe reputation The Lady\nin the Van has gained\nin the run up to its\nrelease can perhaps be\nbest illustrated by the fact that\nduring a recent phone-call to my\ngrandma \u2013 a woman in her late 80s\nwhose closest cinema is the civic\ncentre, where all films are released\n3 months later than anywhere else\n\u2013 she mentioned that she was very\nexcited to go and see it.This is what\nhappens when you blend together\ndirector Nicholas Hynter, actor\nMaggie Smith,and playwright Alan\nBennett: you get a national treasure\nsmoothie, palatable to all.\nBut while this may be the\nreputation the film is conjuring\nup, the actual product is far from\npopulist. Maggie Smith plays Miss\nShepherd, an elderly vagabond with\na past, whose malodorous presence\ninflames Mornington Crescent\u2019s\nresidents\u2019 liberal guilt and innate\ndisgust in equal measure. Taking\nup residence in Alan Bennett\u2019s\ndriveway, she remains there for\n15 years, much to the chagrin\nof neighbours. Alex Jennings is\nwell cast as Bennett, retaining\nthe Yorkshire playwright\u2019s social\nmannerisms that have become so\nwell established over the years, but\nMaggie Smith is the real star of\nthe show; her character is certainly\nsympathetic, but Smith never lets\nthis spill over into sentimentality, a\npermanent sneer etched around her\nmouth.\nCertain aspects of the film don\u2019t\nquite work: a backstory involving a\nsinister figure from Shepherd\u2019s past\nwould be better left out, and the\nidea to have two versions of Alan\nBennett\u2019s character \u2013 the writer\nand the man \u2013 does not work as\nwell as it could have, although it is\nan interesting touch. Hytner, fresh\nfrom his tenure at the National\nTheatre, where he directed Maggie\nSmith in the first stage performance\nof The Lady in the Van, does a\nvery good job at conjuring up the\ncomplex social interactions for\nwhich the North London elite have\nbecome famous.It is a film that goes\ndown smooth, leaving a sensation of\nwarm contentment \u2013 definitely one\nyou can take the granny to.\nFRED FYLES\nTransgender\nrevenge\ndramedies\nare pretty\nhard to\ncome by in\nthe cinema\nChristmas stateside sure looks different in Sean Baker\u2019s LA comedy Tangerine Photo Credit: Magnolia Films\n\n"

    "content": "PAGE 7\nfelixonline.co.uk FRIDAY 20th\nNOVEMBER 2015\nCOMMENT comment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFrance must change\nOne French student says the divisions to blame are ingrained\nNatan Stoessel\nWriter\nA\ns a French national,\nthe events of the 13th\nof November in Paris\nwere a dagger through\nmy heart. It capped off a tragic year\nfor our country. The Charlie Hebdo\nJanuary attacks came as a shock,\nbut the stabbing of three soldiers in\nFebruary followed by the attacks of\nlast Friday have exposed the serious\npolitical crisis within our nation.\nWith the rise of Islamist radicals\nin the world, it pains me to say that\nthese catastrophes on our soil were\ninevitable. The middle-eastern wars\nsince the beginning of this century\nhave fed extremism,but I believe the\nspecific threat to France stems from\nthe accumulation of our political\nfrailties. I will explain myself.\nIn the 19th\nand 20th\ncentury, France\nwas a colonialist power, notably\n\u2018possessing\u2019 territories in North\nAfrica. The end of the violent\nAlgerian War of Independence\nin 1962 marked the end of this\nera, leading to mass immigration\n(notably Muslims) to France.\nIt brought diversity and new\ntalent to the country, but it also\nenhanced inequalities in major\ncities. Gradually, a \u2018stereotypical\u2019\npicture was being drawn as some\nof the immigrants from ex-colonies\nwere being segregated into poorer\ndistricts. It is very important to\nclarify that many immigrants\nintegrated very well and succeeded.\nAs a consequence, as years have\ngone by, the economic alienation of\nsome of these populations, blended\nwith the discriminatory mindset towards them instilled since\nthe colonial period, have swirled\nFrance into an unwanted cultural\nsegregation.\nThis has posed modern-day issues\nregarding the integration of some\nof the Muslims from these tougher\nareas, who are born in our country,\nand descend from immigrant\nfamilies. How can they be\npatriotic when they are sometimes\ndiscriminated against, and have\nthe feeling that the government\nis not helping them escape their\nimpoverished circumstances?\nIn 2004, a law in our country\nwas adopted that prohibits any\nform of visible religious signs in\npublic schools. Hence, women\ncannot wear the headscarf in an\nacademic environment. Before the\n1980s, there was no such debate in\nFrance; the Kippah, for example,\ncould be worn in schools without\na problem until then. However, the\nemergence of a large community of\nMuslims led to this law being voted.\nThis clearly is a stigmatisation\ntowards this community, and a\npolitical contradiction to the \u201copenmindedness towards religion\u201d stated\nin our 1958 Constitution.Therefore,\nsome of them do not feel welcomed\nin our country.\nThe lack of effort from the\ngovernment to dampen this identity\ncrisis clearly feeds the potential\nfor extremism. Indeed, some\npsychologically vulnerable Muslims\nare more likely to be radicalisation\ntargets of Islamist groups.\nThat is why I think last Friday\u2019s\nattacks show the necessity for\nFrance to change. The fact that\na lot of the terrorists guilty of the\n2015 atrocities are French nationals\nshows this identity frailty within\nour nation. We must adapt and\nfight to create unity and respect\nbetween our different cultures. It is\ntrue that we need to react abroad to\ncounter the ISIS threat, but there\nis also a philosophical battle within\nour borders. How do we promote\nthe integration of these vulnerable\nMuslims, and inhibit the rise of\nFrench-born terrorists?\nI believe France must change its\neducation system: we must allow\nreligious signs in schools, and\ntherefore allow the headscarf to be\nworn. Also, we must instil from a\nvery young age the important values\nof our Republic. I was educated in\nthe French system, but I find that\nour famous motto \u201cLiberty,Equality\nand Fraternity\u201d was not stressed\nenough. We must insist on it in\nschools, and exhibit the beauty of a\nfree democratic country.\nFinally, I believe that forcing a\nmilitary service would harmonise\nthe different cultures within our\nnation. These are my opinions, but\nwhatever the changes that are to be\nmade, they need to be concretised\nquickly. It will take generations to\ncreate this craved unity in France,\nbut it is essential if we are to win the\nwar on terror we are facing.\nLondon Bridge was lit up in solidarity.

Unfortunately mistakes and\nill-discipline meant the lads went\nunrewarded for their efforts in\nattack until a slick lineout-and-drive allowed for a man who always\nensures family comes first, Adam\nMotley, to touch down and score\nfor Imperial in the corner before\nhalftime. Dunne was unable to\nadd the conversion but a slim lead\nat halftime meant the next points\nwould be pivotal to the final score.\nAlthough the boys were fired up\nfrom the halftime team talk, poor\ncommunication in defence meant\nthat SOAS were able to create an\noverlap and their winger scored to\ntake the lead from Imperial. Some\nfriendly chats ensued with the ref\nwhen both sets of players realised he\nhad the wrong score written down.\nMuch to the sadness of Imperial\nhearts everywhere, the correct score\nwas clarified and the game played\non.\nIC was forced to play catch-up\nfor the remainder of the second\nhalf and after another SOAS\npenalty due to some dubious work\nat the breakdown, the game seemed\nbeyond saving for Imperial. To\nfurther IC\u2019s struggle, Rob Lawrence\ndecided to take a 10-minute\nbreather and IC were forced to play\nuntil fulltime with 14 men.\nIt took until the very last play of\nthe match for the 2nd\nXV miracle\nman, Will Goldberg, to work his\nmagic and sidestep two defenders to\nscore under the posts. Dunne kept a\ncool head and slotted the conversion\nleading to a final score of 15-15.\nA draw after 80 minutes led to\nsome confusion amongst the players;\nsome where thanking the SOAS\nboys for a good game,some thinking\nabout curries and nightclubs, but\nel capit\u00e1n, Gavin Roberts, had his\nmind on the game and realised\na cup game can\u2019t be left at a draw.\nAfter confirmation from ICURFC\nheadquarters, a further 20 minutes\nwere about to be played to decide\nthe winner. The lads regrouped and\nimmediately got fired up to win the\ngame and stay in the cup.\nIC kicked off through Jones and\nSOAS quickly worked their way\nback into Imperial\u2019s 22. SOAS\nshifted the ball through the\nbackline, which was brilliantly read\nby the phoneless Oli Parker, who\nintercepted the final pass and ran\nthe length of the field to touchdown\nunder the sticks for IC.\nIC finished the first half of extra\ntime with a seven point lead and\nstrong commitment to keeping an\novertime clean sheet. Throughout\nthe second half of extra time, IC\nkept possession and territory to\nkeep SOAS pinned in their own\nhalf.Some good phase play from the\nforwardpodsandsilkybacksallowed\nflanker Roo Mitchell-Heggs to\nburst through a gap and offload just\nbefore the tryline to fresher George\nNicholas who touched down over\nthe line unopposed. Dunne added\nthe extras and sealed the win for IC.\nThere was a small sense of\ndisappointment that we did not\nsettle the match through a historic\nround of penalty kicks but there will\nbe opportunity for that later in the\ncup.\nThe victory song and port tasted\nextra sweet after a hard-fought win\nfor the 2\u2019s, and the unbeaten record\nholds up for another week.Onwards\nand upwards.\nRUGBY: SOAS fail to knock out IC\nOvertime cup progression for the mighty Rugby 2s\nEdric Ramirez-Valdez\nWriter El capit\u00e1n,\nGavin\nRoberts, had\nhis mind on\nthe game and\nrealised a cup\ngame can\u2019t\nbe left at a\ndraw\nHOCKEY\nWOMEN\u2019S 1st\n(MEDICS)\nvs WOMEN\u2019S 2nd\nMEN\u2019S 2nd\nvs. LSE\nTABLE TENNIS\nWOMEN\u2019S 1st\nvs LSE\nMEN\u2019S 2nd\nvs CARDIFF\nHome fixtures: Wednesday 25th\nNovember\nRUGBY UNION\nWOMEN\u2019S 1st\nvs BRUNEL\nMEN\u2019S 2nd\n(MEDICS)\nvs ESSEX\nBADMINTON\nWOMEN\u2019S 1st\nvs UCL\nMEN\u2019S 2nd\nvs QUEEN MARY\nBASKETBALL\nMEN\u2019S 1st\nvs KCL\nWOMEN\u2019S 1st\nvs CAMBRIDGE\nFOOTBALL\nWOMEN\u2019S 1st\nvs KINGSTON\nGOLF\nMIXED 1st\nvs CANTERBURY\nCHRIST CHURCH\nNETBALL\nWOMEN\u2019S 1st\n(MEDICS)\nvs UWE\nWOMEN\u2019S 5th\n(MEDICS)\nvs UCL\nWOMEN\u2019S 6th\nvs KCL\nWOMEN\u2019S 9th\nvs ST MARY\u2019S\nTENNIS\nWOMEN\u2019S 1st\nvs SUSSEX\nLACROSSE\nWOMEN\u2019S 1st\nvs OXFORD\nBROOKES\nMEN\u2019S 1st\nvs PLYMOUTH\nFENCING\nWOMEN\u2019S 2nd\nvs CAMBRIDGE\n\n"

It\u2019s\na damnably English affair.\nBanned in 1906, it has, in parts,\nrelaxed gently into middle age. The\nback story \u2013 a political scheme to cut\nthe British church and state apart\n\u2013 would struggle to move many\noutside the back end of Belfast.\nNationalTheatre revives banned classic\nMax Falkenberg\nArts Editor\nWaste exposes the hypocrisy of Victorian morality and remains relevant today\nspeak to the cast, but refused).\nThe National\u2019s,clean \u2013 even\u2018IKEA\u2019\nlike staging does an excellent job\nof emphasising this bigger picture.\ntake as a brother a man who has\nnever known how to love. It\u2019s very\ncareful work \u2013 to be strong in this\neggshell, pitiable kind of way, is a\nhard balance to hold.\nAbove all, Waste reminds me of\ntwo things. It\u2019s a challenge not to\naccept convention for convention\u2019s\nsake. Crucially, it\u2019s a reminder\nthat we shouldn\u2019t take change for\ngranted. Progress is not always\ninevitable. Perhaps we have pushed\nback some of Granville\u2019s demons,\nbut the fact his words are still sharp,\nliving things today is warning\nenough. Ultimately, he tells us , we\nshould not bind ourselves or turn\naway from the truth. As Trebell,\nthat dead, broken idealist would say\n\u2013 \u201cThe fear of life is the beginning\nof all evil\u201d.\nUntil 19th\nMarch at the National\nTickets from \u00a315\ntribalism that accompanies it. The\n\u2018system\u2019 is the only real character\never on stage. Personal details\nare irrelevant and the story arc is\nobvious. It\u2019s the crazy mechanics of\nthe political downfall that this play\nspeaks about. However, Waste is a\nbemused caricature of a system of\ndouble standards that is somehow\nstable, but run on a completely\nfake, theatrical morality. We come\naway with a certainty, that to a man,\nthis is a cast of hypocrites. Trebell\u2019s\nexecutioners \u2013 a pluck of adulterers,\na pinch of monied holiness are as\nguilty as he. Being right is simply a\ncase of not being caught.\nIn that sense, it\u2019s as sharp today as\nwhen the ink dried. Lord Horsham,\nanxious and waiting, pale faced for\nMr. O\u2019Conell could be Gordon\nBrown on the night of the expenses\nscandal \u2013 or Henry Trebell a Nick\nClegg of sorts (who was invited to\nbrooding sense of mortality to it.\nAs the play puts it, \u201cEither life is\ntoo little a thing to matter or it\u2019s so\nbig that such specks of it as we may\nbe are of no account.\u201d The effect is\nmarred only by some fairly clunky\nscreen transitions (blackouts in all\nbut name) that give the whole thing\na disconcerting hint of punch and\nJudy. In theme maybe, but it\u2019s a\nkiller for the pace.\nActress Sylvestra Le Touzel\ndeserves special mention as the\nmotherly, bumbling sister to\nEdward\u2019s Trebell.A character which\ncould so easily become unbelievable\nand fluffy \u2013 noise to be drowned\nout by Trebell\u2019s thunderous idealism\nor the sleaze around him, Touzel\nmanages a set of wonderfully\nbalanced monologues. In the space\nof a scene we are moved \u2013 (in a\nway that goes so lightly on the\nmozzarella you might miss it) \u2013 to\nCharles Edwards as Henry Trebell. This guy looks serious. Photo Credit: Johan Persson\nWaste is one\ngreat shout\nagainst that\nsystem,\nand the\npetty class\ntribalism that\naccompanies\nit\nBut focusing on the setting and\nthe antics of our anti\u2013hero, career\npolitician and cold\u2013blooded atheist,\nHenry Trebell (Charles Edwards),\nwould be a mistake.\nThe doomed relationship between\nTrebell and the wily, married\nAmy O\u2019Conell (a sparkling Olivia\nWilliams) is a summary of the\nplot \u2013 and a side note. His first and\nlast, it barely makes it beyond a one\nnight stand.\nHowever, things roll along\nsmoothly enough from here \u2013 and\nwe follow the consequences of this\nillicit affair, until Trebell is left a\npurposeless, broken man.\nThat said, seeing Waste as just\nanother Victorian fable about the\nruin of idle sex would be as sloppy as\nthe backstreet abortion that exposes\nour loveless couple. The real punch\nof the comment here is the reverse.\nWaste is one great shout against\nthat system, and the petty class\nThere\u2019s a\nconstant,\nbrooding\nsense of\nmortality\nThe cast are swamped by the space\nof it \u2013 little toy cogs in the great big\nmessy engine of politics. It looks \u2013\nin a way that isn\u2019t cheap \u2013 as if it all\nmight be packed up and swept away\nin an instant. There\u2019s a constant,\nBirth, death, and the messiness in between\nMorgen und Abend throws us into a man\u2019s existence, and beyond with mixed results\nEmiel de Lange\nWriter\nW\nhere words leave\noff, music begins\u201d,\nsaid the poet\nHeinrich Heine.\nMorgen und Abend, a new opera by\nAustrian composer Georg Friedrich\nHaas, attempts to go where words\ncannot and follows a man,Johannes,\ninto existence and beyond into\ndeath. Although death (together\nwith love) is one of those ubiquitous\nthemes in opera, it is usually the act\nof dying rather than the experience\nof being dead. This opera then\npromises a new kind of musical\nexperience.\nIndeed, Morgen und Abend\nis unlike anything you are likely\nto have heard before, and at\nkey moments it is spectacularly\nsuccessful. As Johannes is born into\nthe world, it almost seems as if the\nfabric of the universe is being pulled\nand stretched, as if to accommodate\nhis new consciousness. Long\nsustained notes, and glissandi in\nthe strings create hallucinogenic\ntextures, shifting between light and\ndark. An unseen choir gives the\nsense of something great occurring.\nAlthough the orchestra produces\nthese soundscapes flawlessly, such\nmagical moments are heard only a\nhandful of times. As the plot seems\nto concern itself with mundanities\nfor large stretches, the music often\nfeels reduced in its significance, or\neven unnecessarily hefty.\nAs with the music, Fosse\u2019s Joycean\nscript at times provides the pure\nsensation of birth and death,\nstuttering long strings of descriptive\nwords and noises to great effect.\nBut it is all too often distracted\nby irrelevant details, attempting\nto create logical consistencies\nor perhaps just filling time. For\nexample; that Peter has been sent\nback as Johannes\u2019s best friend in\norder to guide him into death adds\nnothing to our understanding, and\nin fact feels rather more like the\nsort of supernatural explanation\nfound in a young adult novel. There\nare deeper problems too. Though\ntitled \u201cMorgen und Abend\u201d,\nmorning and evening, the morning\nscene depicting Johannes\u2019s birth\nis just a short introduction to the\ninterminably long evening in which\nwe watch as Johannes painstakingly\ncomes to understand what the\naudience has long realised \u2013 that he\nis dead.\nVisually, we are presented with a\nsuitably minimal and grey tableau.\nImportant objects are strewn about:\na door, a bed, a fishing boat. These\nare used sparingly, with a further\nlayer of symbolism being attached to\nthem each time.The door becomes a\ngateway between worlds and times,\nthe boat on which he used to fish\nbecomes the vessel to carry him off.\nWe seem to be in a timeless space,\nmoving backwards and forwards\nas we hop through the chronology\nof Johannes\u2019s memory. More use\ncould have been made of the visual\nmetaphors suggested in the text,\nsuch as the ocean being the vast\nrealm of death \u2013 instead we are left\nLong\nsustained\nnotes, and\nglissandi in\nthe strings\nshift between\nlight and\ndark, creating\nflawless\nsoundscapes\nto imagine these against the white\nbackdrop on stage. One lighting\ntrick at the end really impressed\nme, seemingly setting everything\non stage into relief as if in stone\nand emphasising the permanence of\ndeath.\nThe small cast of singers and actors\ndid very well in performing such\ndifficult music. In particular Sarah\nWegener, in the role of Signe, was\nforced to grapple with microtones.\nHowever, despite this, Morgen\nund Abend doesn\u2019t quite meet the\nweight of its subject matter. A few\nuniquely profound moments here\nand there almost rescue the plot\u2019s\nstrange occupation with more\nmundane matters. For some, it may\nbe more interesting to read Ludwig\nWittgenstein\u2019s ideas on death in the\nprogramme notes. Perhaps better\nfor the Royal Opera to heed his\nadvice; \u201cWhereof one cannot speak,\nthereof one must be silent\u201d.\nUntil 28th\nNovember at the Royal\nOpera House\nTickets from \u00a35\nCharles Edwards and Olivia Williams in Waste.

Most Physics boys are\ntoo scared at this concept\nso you only get one reply\nbut unfortunately it\u2019s your\nthermodynamics lecturer.\nThis week your housemate\nthat spends every night at\nher boyfriend\u2019s is finally\nback but she seems to have\naged dramatically. Turns out\nwhilst she was away she had\nlike 3 kids. Time flies when\nyou\u2019re at Imperial, I guess.\nThis week, you are the\nFELIX Editor. Yet again,\nyou find yourself reprinting\nthe same bloody images at\nthe whim of Hangman. We\u2019d\nsay it sucks to be you, but you\nactually get paid to deal with\nour nonsense.\nThis week you (unlike most\nother Imperial students) get\nlaid! Congratulations! The\nproblem is you went out on\nthe ACC sports night and are\nforced to go into your 9am\nlabs in the outfit you wore\nthe night before. Perhaps you\nshouldn\u2019t have dressed as the\nmurdered quad tree.\nThis week you are no longer\nallowed into FiveSixEight\nfor some reason but due\nto inebriation you can\u2019t\nremember quite what.\nHowever, upon asking\naround you discover that you\ntried to have sex with the\nnew tree in the quad.\nThis week you try to go to\na press screening of a new\nRussian ballet documentary\nin SoHo. However, you\nmistakenly go into brothel\nand it turns out that the\nRomanov Dynasty shows all\nextravaganza is not what you\nexpected.\nThis week your routine of\nhaving a shower in halls at\nprecisely 9pm is interrupted\nwhen you find that an\nimpromptu orgy has been\norganised in the communal\nshowers. Quite frankly you\nare just annoyed that you\nreceived no invitation.\nThis week you are convinced\nthat you met the love of\nyour life whilst visiting a\nfriend at Loughborough\nUniversity; however, all you\ncan remember is that he was\nplaying Danny from Grease\nso you tweet a nude to John\nTravolta in hope of being\nreunited.\nThis week as horoscopes\nwriter you realise how much\nyou hate this fucking job. I\nmean no one even knows\nwho I am? Bullshit. I spend\nlike an hour on these. Some\nof these are even real so I\u2019ve\nhad to carefully write them to\nprotect anonymity. Fuck you,\nFELIX.\nThis week your Irish dance\nHorizons teacher is driven\nto the edge due to the fact\nyou no longer reply to her\nemails, causing her to remove\nyour legs so you are no longer\nallowed to dance. At least\nyou can claim mitigating\ncircumstances.\nThis week you are very close\nto finishing your Mech Eng\nmasters project and once it\nis done all of humanity will\nthank you. However, when\nyou show it to your supervisor\nhe doesn\u2019t think a robot that\nalerts you to when someone\nis going to walk in on you\nmasturbating is a good idea.\nHOROSCOPES\nNEWS WITHOUTTHE NEWS\nPM RESPONDS TO REQUEST\nFOR RETURN OF KOH-I-NOOR\nTO INDIA\nJEREMY ON JEREMY: \u201cPOLITICALLY NAIVE\nAND DOOMED TO FAIL\u201d\nWhat\u2019s going on inside the\nBlue Cube this week\nWhat is: Science?\nFor those of you who are perhaps a little\nnew to this \u2018College of Science, Technology\nand Medicine\u2019 business, we\u2019re running a\nspecial catch-up session just for you!\nThat\u2019sright,thisweek\u2019s\u2018Whatis\u2019isexclusively\ndevoted to science - all of it! Come on over\nto the Boardroom from 1pm on Monday to\ndiscover all the wonders that science holds\nin store for you, and why it\u2019s clearly a much\nbetter choice for universities to specialise in\nthan all of that \u201chumanities\u201d nonsense.\nStaff wishing to know more about the\nhumanities, rather than science, should get\nin contact with the Vice Provost (Grievance\nProcedures), Celia Overup, at c.overup@\nimperial.ac.uk, whereupon Celia will be\nable to provide you with more information.\nAny resemblance between this information\nand a p45 is purely coincidental.\nBlue3\nLaunch Party\nThe end of November draws near, and that\ncan only mean one thing - that\u2019s right, it\u2019s\ntime for our pre-Christmas Party!\nDue to the College Closure over the\nDecember/January period (not a \u201ccheeky\nmonth-and-a-half\u2019s holiday\u201d, as some staff\nhave been heard referring to it as), we are\nof course completely unable to celebrate\nChristmas together at the correct time.\nWiththatinmind,we\u2019redelightedtoconfirm\nthis year\u2019s Pre-Christmas Party will be held\non Wednesday in the Boardroom from 1pm\n\u2013 there will be a small competition to come\nup with a better name than \u2018Pre-Christmas\nParty\u2019, and as we all know, competitions\nmean prizes, so don\u2019t miss out!\nWe look forward to seeing you there \u2013 don\u2019t\nforget your party hats and yoga mats, and\ngreen tea will (of course) be provided!\nWhat\u2019sOnoutsidetheBlue\nCube this week\nFollowing on from last week\u2019s campus-wide\n(if not city-wide!) rejoicing at the rebirth,\nrelaunch and redesign of Blue3\n, we\u2019re still\nnot entirely sure what\u2019s actually happening\nbeyond these fine, four walls of this brilliant,\nblue building we all love to work in.\nWe did send out a couple of the interns to\ntry and discern what \u201cthe haps\u201d (as I am\nreliably informed the kids these days are\nsaying) were for the common or garden\nstudent, but this provided regrettably\ninconclusive results.\nAlice Gast: Thought of the Week\n\u201cI took the chance to look at our wonderful\ninstitution through the lens of an outsider this\nweek, drinking in all this wonderful science\nknowledge without any experience of what it\u2019s\nreally like inside. As this hypothetical outside, I\nmarvelled at our wonderful prime real estate,\nspread across London, and I admired our\nworld-leading facilities. But, most importantly,\nI celebrated the fact that we don\u2019t have any of\nthose bloody humanities students to drag us\ndown.\u201d\nThe weekly newsletter of the Faculty Building\nBlue3\nProvost Post of\nthe Week\nEvery week, we like to\nprovide the opportunity for\none of our wonderful Vice\nProvosts to write a short\ncolumn on a topic of their\nchoice. Providing our staff\nwith the opportunity to\ncommunicate to the masses\nin such a highly respected\norgan as Blue3\nis key to our\ncontinued commitment to\nstaff development here in the\nBlue Cube. This week, we\u2019ve\nasked the Vice Provost (Staff\nManagement), Reese Huffle,\nto give us a few words!\nHi everybody!\nI\u2019m delighted to be able\nto take this opportunity to\nshare a few words with all you\nmagnificent workers of the Blue\nCube, and I\u2019d like to thank the\nboys (and girl!) in Comms for\nmaintaining such a fantastic\npublication. I\u2019d also like to\nthank Alice for giving me this\nprestigious slot, and I\u2019m sure\nshe won\u2019t be disappointed with\nwhat I\u2019ve got to show you all!\nUnfortunately, Reese was\nunable to complete his column\ndue to an unexpected top-down reorganisation of his\ndepartment. As a result of this\norganisational restructure,\nsome minor down-sizing\noccurred, and Reese was\nregrettably shuffled off to\nanother, lesser paid job in\nsome other, less world-leading\ninstitution.\nDue to Reese no longer\nbeing with us, we regret that\nwe may have to cut this week\u2019s\nProvost Post somewhat shorter\nthan we would like, and feel\nthat this lack of commitment\nand willingness to see things\nthrough to the end, no matter\nwhat, is typical of Reese\u2019s\nattitude and perhaps indicative\nof why the time had come for\nhim to be (forcibly) moved on.\nAnyone with any queries\nor concerns over the recent\nstaffing changes can of course\nget in touch with our staff\ncomplaints email address,\ndisciplinaryproceedings@\nimperial.ac.uk.\nHello all,\nGood morning, good afternoon and good evening, and welcome back to\nanother wonderful issue of Blue3\n!\nIt\u2019s been a hectic week here in the Faculty Building, and I\u2019m sure you\ncan\u2019t wait to take the chance to de-stress, put your feet up in one of our\nspecially-designed break-out areas, and catch up with all the latest news\nfrom across the Imperial campus (well, the important parts of it, anyway)!\nAfter all the excitement of the Blue3\nrelaunch last week, everything\nwas going to feel like a bit of an anti-climax, so we can understand any\nelement of disappointment or feeling of diminishing returns you might\nget while perusing this week\u2019s copy, but rest assured: the lovely boys (and\ngirl!) in Comms assure me they have plenty of fabulous and exciting tricks\nleft up their sleeves!\nThis week\u2019s big, blue news is of course that Imperial has been making\na splash in the media with our latest commitment to Doing Science\u2122\n(can someone please check if this is the correct trademak? We have so\nmany, and I\u2019d hate to accidentally muck up the branding). We\u2019ve been\ncovered in some very big national newspapers for our forthright and\nuncompromising new position on antibiotics, and I\u2019m very glad to see the\npositive and encouraging response from the world at large.\nSome expressed surprise that we were taking such a strong and world-leading Stance on Science\u2122 (again, can someone please check if this is\ncorrect? All this branding business is hard work), and I had to laugh. As\na Science Stronghold\u2122 (that\u2019s one I just made up, can someone actually\nget that trademarked please?), of course we are taking the lead on such\nimportant issues as \u201cpeople should have antibiotics\u201d and \u201cantibiotics\u201d,\nbecause if not us, who? Those posh tossers at Cambridge? I don\u2019t think\nso.\nWe\u2019ve also apparently been up to some nonsense with \u201ccryptocurrency\u201d,\nwhatever that is. One of the interns tried to explain \u201cBitcoin\u201d to me the\nother day, but why anyone would want a bit of a coin when they could\njust have a whole one (or rather, lots of whole ones) is completely beyond\nme! Kids these days.\nHave a happy, prosperous, wonderful and collaborative week!\nFormerly \u2018Blue News\u2019\n\n"

Socalled \u2018Islamic State\u2019 have claimed\nresponsibility.\nDavid Cameron has announced\na \u201ccomprehensive strategy\u201d for\ndealing with ISIS, which he says\nincludes making the case for air\nstrikes on Syria. Parliament rejected\nto join military strikes in Syria back\nin 2013, but it is likely that there\nwill be another vote on the matter\nsoon.\nSince the attacks, France has\nlaunched air strikes on ISIS\u2019\nSyrian base in Raqqa. With the\nUS-led coalition, 30 airstikes\nwere conducted on Sunday night,\nwith more following in the week.\nReports on how many were injured\nhave been vague.\nLast week George Osborne\nannounced, from the Imperial West\ncampus, plans to up the number of\nspies in all three security agencies.\nDavid Cameron has now reiterated\nthat he will increase staff numbers\n15% and double the budget for\nairline security.\nGRACE RAHMAN\nImperial had\nan intake\nof around\n370 French\nstudents\nlast year\nand the accompanying \u201cinfiltration\u201d\nof China\u2019s \u201cideological sphere\u201d\nwith liberal western ideas. Beyond\nthe wordy preface its message\nto authorities and institutions is\nsummarized as such: tow the party\nline,punish dissent.This suppression\nhas steadily intensified following\nthe appointment of President Xi\nJingping, who visited the UK and\nImperial College in late October.\nWhile Mr. Jingping has been\nhailed as an economic reformer,\nhis appetite for political reform\nhas been less than encouraging. As\nreported by the Guardian, liberal\nacademics have been coming under\nincreasing pressure from the state\nsince his appointment in 2012.\nThis reflects a move back to a more\nunilateral style of governance that\nis less tolerant of free thinking.

Opening\nAiden Langan\nWriter\nMS MR\nwith \u2018Snake Oil\u2019,the crowd excitedly\nopened up a mosh pit. As the drum\nbeat came in, it felt like a boxing\nmatch. Ding ding, round five.\nThe mosh pits stayed active\nthroughout the gig, with the energy\nof the crowd and the band never\nlapsing. Even calmer songs, such as\n\u2018Blue Blood\u2019from Total Life Forever,\ncaused mass singalongs with the\nentire crowd screaming along.\n\u2018Give It All\u2019 slowed things down.\nSome bands put in slower and more\nmelodic songs to make the crowd\nthink later songs are heavier. Foals\ndo not; they do so to prevent the\ncrowd fainting from the madness.\n\u2018Providence\u2019 from Holy Fire was\na particular highlight for me. The\ncrowd went mad, and an audience\nmember even chipped a tooth.\nThe gig calmed down again with\none of Foals\u2019greatest songs,\u2018Spanish\nSahara\u2019; a melodic masterpiece\nwhich continued to bring the crowd\ncloser together. The band really\nshowed their skill with frenzy-inducing solos.\nIt was beautiful as the whole\nG\nracefully floating from\nsynth to drums, T\u0100L\u0100\nimmediately made the\nstage her own, pouring\nevery part of herself into her singing,\nlyrics and production.\nThe ICA often plays host to\nmultidisciplinary artists, but T\u0100L\u0100\nhas honed a single craft, the ability\nT\u0100L\u0100 live at ICA\nto reconstruct an electronic song\nsingle-handedly live on stage.\nThere may have been some trickery\nbehind the scenes; regardless,\nT\u0100L\u0100 showed how one woman can\ndominate a space and captivate an\naudience.\nOn her numerous EPs she explores\npop music to its fullest. There are\nclear similarities to M.I.A., but\nT\u0100L\u0100 doesn\u2019t let this define her.\nShe\u2019s more influenced by her own\nIranian heritage than by the music\nof her contemporaries.\nAs only her second live show, it\nwas all the more impressive.Leaving\nthe stage smiling, it was obvious\nthat T\u0100L\u0100 was pleased with her\nperformance.\nT\u0100L\u0100 blends her Iranian heritage with modern-style music. Photo Credit: T\u0100L\u0100 A brilliant performance with lackluster vocals. Photo Credit: Cale Tilford\nI\nt\u2019s rare to find a band with\nsuch mesmerising on-stage\nchemistry. Last Tuesday at\nElectric Brixton, MS MR\nbrought their dynamic live show to\nLondon.\nLead singer Lizzy Plapinger\u2019s\ngenuine excitement was evident in\nher sweat and tears; her presence\nput the audience in a state of awe.\nIt was difficult not to gaze at her as\nshe sparkled across the stage in her\nglittery playsuit.\nWith performances that are as\nenergetic as this, it\u2019s forgiveable\nthat the vocals are drowned out\nand breathy. The catchy synths and\nbombastic drums were a little more\npleasing than Plapinger\u2019s middling\nvocals. But when compared to the\nrecorded versions, many of the\nsongs felt messy.\nOnly the best can balance a bold\nstage presence with an excellent\nlive sound. Unfortunately, MS MR\naren\u2019t quite there yet.\ncrowd sang, not just to the band\nbut to each other. People hugged\nand emotion of the audience was\noverwhelming.\neleven songs and they were gone.\nObviously, they returned for an\nencore. Dedicated to anyone who\n\u201cwon anything in the roulette shop.\u201d\n\u2018London Thunder\u2019 from the new\nalbum was played with more punch\nthan on the record, with Yannis\nPhilippakis (lead singer, guitarist)\ninitially playing solo.\nFoals finished with two of their\nheaviest songs: starting with the\ntitle track from What Went Down.\nYannis crowdsurfed while still\nplaying guitar, returned to the stage,\nand then went in again for another\ngo.The crowd greeted Yannis almost\nlike a messiah.\n\u2018Two Steps, Twice\u2019 built up slowly\nover eight minutes. The crowd was\nstill wild, only now beginning to\ntire. Yannis had gone to the bar\nwith his guitar, downing a shot in\nthe process. The crowd reaches its\nclimax and the concert finishes. Not\none person left without a smile on\ntheir face.\nI\u2019ve said it before and I\u2019ll say it\nagain: Foals are quite possibly the\nbest live band in the UK.\nCale Tilford\nMusic Editor\nThis way to Dreamland.

Which isn\u2019t bad; white people\ncan go to carnival. Maybe the fact\nthat any song on the album could\nquite comfortably be the backing\ntrack on your GoPro filmed gap yah\nvideo montage is a good thing.\nHis sampling of old rave vids, the\nnotable downer on some tracks and\nlack of lyrics on others, makes for\nan album you just turn up Spotify\u2019s\ntwelve second fade option on, and\nplay all night. \u2018Obvs\u2019 and its joyful\nrooftop steel drums as folks arrive,\n\u2018Good Times\u2019 as the party heats\nup, the ethereal \u2018The Rest Is Noise\u2019\nas the hangers on refuse to leave,\nand his xx bandmate Romy\u2019s \u2018Loud\nPlaces\u2019 as a kind of hipster \u2018Mr\nBrightside\u2019that you all sing along to\nbefore collapsing or going home. It\nreally is an album of the people.\nS\nlaves\u2019 Are You Satisfied?\ngetting nominated for a\nMercury Prize is pretty\nweird, but then the\nTunbridge Wells garage rock two-piece Slaves are far from ordinary.\nPlaying dirty basements only a\ncouple of years ago, Slaves have\nsince experienced massive success\nthat their contemporaries (such as\nHookworms and the sorely missed\nWet Nuns) can only marvel at,\nheadlining large dirty clubs and\nweirdly signing to Virgin EMI (but\nthen not every band can release a\nmassive hit single like \u201cWhere\u2019s\nYour Car Debbie\u201d).\nThe appeal of Slaves\u2019 debut album\nis pure fun. Dirty, spiky guitar riffs\nswirl amongst simple drumming\npunctuated by shouty Frank Carteresque (post Gallows) vocals. The\nchoruses to all the songs show\ngreat gang vocals adding to the\ncheek lyrics. Sure, this album\u2019s not\nwall-to-wall bangers, but it is about\nthree songs too long (and that\u2019s\nbeing kind) with songs like \u2018She\nWants Me Now\u2019 and \u2018Wow!!!7AM\u2019\nreally falling short. Let\u2019s be honest,\na band playing sloppy garage rock is\nnever going to be consistent.\nThis album is a worthy winner of\nthe Mercury Prize.The album is fun\nand doesn\u2019t take itself too seriously;\nit\u2019s easily the best release this year\nfrom the British rock scene (on this\nshort list at least). This award could\ngo to some obscure arty album, but\nwhere would the fun be in that?\nF\nrom the depths of the\ndeep web, Aphex Twin\nreturned in late 2014 with\nSyro. 138 separate pieces\nof equipment come together, all\nin absolute harmony, to create an\nsingle soundscape. Nothing ever\nfeels auxiliary or out of place.\nit never sounds as dark), but it feels\nmore like a throwback. Which isn\u2019t\nsurprising given that the album was\nrecorded over a number of years.\nSeamlessly shifting from one track\nto another, Syro morphs between\nsub-genres in over 64 minutes of\nmusic. From ambient to glitch and\ntechno, all are executed expertly.\n\u2018minipops 67 [120.2][source field\nmix]\u2019was the first Aphex Twin track\nin 13 years, and it starts off the\nalbum with twinkling piano notes\nand disorientating vocals.\nThe wonky synths of \u2018produk 29\n[101]\u2019 overlay a plodding bass while\na ghostly female voice jabbers \u201cLike,\nwe were at that club / Fucking\nhouse / Disgusting / Needy slut /\nFucking whore.\u201d Although oddly\ndisturbing, it\u2019s just one of many\nweird vocal samples on the album.\nThe razor-sharp \u2018s950tx16wasr10\n[163.97][earth portal mix]\u2019 (at this\npoint in the tracklist the titles are\nunpronounceable) bounces from\nacid to jungle, wobbling your mind\nin the process.\nIt\u2019s surprising that not a single\nrecord from his expansive career\nhas ever been nominated for the\naward. Yet no figure has been more\ninfluential in modern electronic\nmusic. Syro proves that even after\nyears of hiding in the shadows, no\none can craft music as intelligently\nand flawlessly as Aphex Twin.\nF\nlorence + The Machine put\nout their third album this\nsummer, and it rocketed to\nthe top of the charts - #1\non the Billboard 200, and all the\nrelevant UK metrics. Oh, and they\nheadlined Glastonbury.\ninstrumentation, and some of\nthe nicest singing you\u2019ve ever\nheard. That\u2019s what you should\nexpect from this album. Lots of\ncritics have complained about the\ninstrumentation, but that\u2019s never\nbeen one of their strengths. It\u2019s\nall decent, atmospheric, reverb-y\nwhatever. It sounds alright.\nThe *point* is Flo.And Flo crushes\nit in a routine, almost mundane way.\nBack in the United States, we have\na saying, \u201cthere are three certainties\nin life: death, taxes, and traffic jams\non I-93.\u201d If there was a fourth, I\nguess it would be Florence turning\nin a pitch-perfect performance.\nstunning. She\u2019s basically Adele with\nan indie vibe.\nI\u2019ve looked hard for one, but there\nisn\u2019t a flaw with her performance.\nLike I mentioned earlier, the only\ncriticism that actually lands is\nabout the instrumentation. C\u2019mon.\nIt\u2019s the Mercury Awards. Not to\nknock Ghostpoet, but his critically-acclaimed early work was probably\ncomposed by a Casio calculator or\nsomething.\nAt the end of the day, the vocals\nare the point, and Flo\u2019s vocals are on\npoint.\nM\nurphy has exercised\nwhat seems to be\ncomplete creative\ncontrol over the\nproject, extending even to the music\nvideos, an achievement that is no\nmean feat; each beat seems precisely\nin the right place, each guitar riff\ntimed to complete perfection. And\nyet dangerous emotional currents\nlie beneath the calm surface. Like\nsomeone trying to hold things\ntogether following a personal crisis,\nthere is the sense that Hairless Toys\ncould come crashing down at any\nminute.\nMurphy affords us precious\nfew insights into this maelstrom,\nbut there are moments where the\nmask slips: \u2018Uninvited Guest\u2019, a\nfunky number reminiscent of early\nGrace Jones, spirals out of control,\nthe base groove unravelling into\na dreamy whispered sequence,\nalbum, but about four minutes from\nthe end: during \u2018Unputdownable\u2019,\nwhere Murphy compares a lover to a\nfavourite book, the chilly synths and\nclaves are suddenly cut through with\na burst of acoustic guitar,completely\nblindsiding us. It\u2019s a sign that, even\nafter 50 minutes of Hairless Toys\nand 20 years in the business, Roisin\nMurphy has not lost the power to\nsurprise. \u2018And when at last I turn\nto the end/I turn back to page one\nand again/pour over every word\u2019she\nsings \u2013 a perfect attitude towards\nthis remarkable album,one to return\nto, again and again.\nT\nhis four-piece grunge\nrock band from North\nLondon splashed onto\nthe music scene back in\n2013 with a fresh sound described\nas the love child of folk and grunge.\nTheir unique combination saw\nthem release a number of successful\ntheir debut studio album My Love Is\nCool,reaching a peak of number two\nin the UK album charts. The album\nhas received positive reviews and\nfeatures chart topping singles.\nTo reach where they are presently,\nWolf Alice have come far in a\nrelatively short span of time. From\ntheir early folky acoustic style, they\nhave transformed into an off-kilter\nrock band, incorporating post-grunge themes.\nEver-present on the UK tour\nand festival scene, they deliver\nsolid performance after solid\nperformance, mesmerising crowds\nwith the soothing voice of lead\nsinger Ellie Rowsell. Lulling their\naudiences into a false sense of\nindie-cradled security, the band\nthen swerve into a ruthless and\nunanticipated riff-filled thrash pop\nhell.\nThis kind of unpredictability is\nrare and ever increasingly desirable\nin new music,which is why My Love\nIs Cool has done so well achieving\nthis Mercury Prize nomination.\nNot only is the music of Wolf\nAlice a new and unique fusion,\nbut the band itself is a flag-waving\nspearhead for new upcoming British\nbands.\nIt only makes sense that this young\nand vibrant quartet are awarded the\n2015 Mercury Music Prize.\nGRACE RAHMAN\nROB GARSIDE\nCALE TILFORD\nFRED FYLES\nHENRY ESHBAUGH\nPETER MUNTON\nsome point with Jamie.\n\u201cIf they\u2019re going on tour, I\u2019d like\nto go out with them.\u201d Can you\nimagine?\nBut I wonder, while Jamie\u2019s\nsipping Ka with Young Thug, do\nThe xx really support him in his\nsolo endeavours as their Instagram\nposts suggest? Are the others really\nall off pursuing separate projects, or\nare they the Kelly and Michelle to\nhis Beyonce? While Beyonce may\nbe the leader of the free world, no\none can say \u2018question\u2019 without me\nthinking,\u2018tell me how you feel about\nme\u2019. Similarly, although \u2018Loud\nTimes\u2019, and presumably, not in the\neyes of the Mercury Music Prize\npeople.\nThe flabbergasting combo of Jamie\nSmith, dance hall A-lister Popcaan,\nYoung Thug and The Persuasions\u2019\n\u2018Good Times\u2019 made for a track\nthat has the gusto to support the\nwhole album, and potentially win\nJamie the prize. When some of the\noriginal Persuasions members heard\nthe sampled track, on hearing lines\nlike Thug\u2019s \u2018I\u2019m-a ride that pussy\nlike a stroller\u2019, one exclaimed, \u201cwow,\ntimes have changed, man!\u201d but they\nstill expressed a desire to perform at\nenergy and live feel of the album.\nMinimalism is a prevailing theme\nthroughout, which adds to the\nplayful (but slightly aggressive)\nattitude. The riffs are distorted and\nuncomplicated whilst the drums are\nsparse and tribal.The lyrical content\nfollows the same theme; you\u2019ll find\nno over-complicated or pretentious\nlyrics from the twin vocalists here,\njust shouty calls to dance.\nThe first single of this album\n\u2018Cheer Up London\u2019 (with the bratty\nrefrain of \u201cYou\u2019re dead already!\nDead! Dead! Already\u201d) is the best\nthis album can deliver, exhibiting\ncatchy choruses and tongue-in-Syro sounds isolated from the\npresent. There are clear similarities\nto Burial\u2019s recent work (although\nminute \u2018exploitation\u2019, lyrics cut\nout in favour of an instrumental\nbreakdown, drums overlapping each\nother in a form of unpredictable\nrandomness. In \u2018Hairless Toys\n(Gotta Hurt)\u2019 Murphy\u2019s delicate\ncooing is ensconced within a cloak\nof stabbing synths before being\ncompletely subsumed, the lyrical\ncontent rendered nonsense by a wall\nof icy sound.

In 2010 when fees were\ndue to rise, union council voted to\nsupport the Browne review, and the\npresident wrote several damning\narticles in FELIX as to why he\ndisagreed with the student protests\nthat were happening at the time.\nThis council paper doesn\u2019t seek to\nchange the ability of the union to\nlobby the government, but rather\nwould prevent the union from\nlobbying its own students, whether\nthat be for the benefit of the union\nor its members.\nThe proposal would not do away\nwith union-funded campaigns, but\ndemands that campaigns are equally\nfunded. Slightly more difficult\nto police would be the paper\u2019s\nammendment that two union-funded campaigns would have to\nbe \u201cpresented with equal gusto\u201d. It\nalso makes the point that the \u201clack\nof a volunteer for one stance should\nnot mean a single union-funded\ncampaign goes ahead.\nThe union did not take a stance\nduring the recent general election\nor the Scottish Independence\nReferendum.

Falling on\nRemembrance Day and being\nfollowed by the club curry night,\nthere was a lot to play for to ensure\nthat IC got back on track after an\nunmentionable loss to the medics\nthe week before.\nArriving at the venue to discover\nthat the game would be played on a\n3G pitch, Coach Rich\u2019s rousing pre-match speech dispelled any notion\nthat this was in any way an excuse,\nand saw IC make a solid start to\nthe game, dominating possession\nand creating opportunities early on.\nHowever, a lack of clinical finishing\nsaw the scoreline remain static until\nsloppy play at the breakdown saw\na penalty go Holloway\u2019s way just\ninside IC\u2019s half. This saw their one-trick pony of a fly-half step up and\nunleash his potent kicking ability to\nput Holloway ahead.\nRemaining calm, Imperial\nresponded instantly from the kick\noff, securing possession straight\nfrom the restart through great\npressure from Alex Clayton and\nHugh Wilman. This lead to a line-out fifteen metres out from the as-of-yet-unbreached opposition try\nline. This called for the big guns to\ncome out, and the resulting move\nwas sweeter than the sweetest\nof Peshwaris; slick hands from\nthe dummy mall saw a barrelling\nrun off the peel to finally wreck\nthe opposition line which had\nmaintained abstinence for far\ntoo long. With the conversion\ngoing wayward, at 5-3 the game\nremained tighter than the average\nAlex Calyton gym top; apparently\nMothercare make workout clothes\nnow.\nDue to this, IC continued in the\nsame spirit as before, with centres\nChris MacBeth and Sam Moorby\u2019s\nhard lines off Charles Posh-Smith\npunching regular holes in the\ndefence. Thanks to the unison of\nthe forward pods the team trundled\nup the pitch and set the stage for\nMoorby, who finished off a long\nset of phases by blasting through\na \u201cReceding\u201d Holloway defence\nto dot down over the line. Extras\nadded by CPS, Imperial seemed in\ncontrol. However, a late Holloway\npenalty saw them stay within a\nconverted try as half time came with\nIC leading 12-6.\nHowever, even with the game\ngoing to plan, as they say: it\u2019s never\nover until the fat lady sings, and it\nseems that the mellifluous old gal\nhad only begun warming up her\nvocal chords. Holloway came out\nguns blazing in the second half, and\ncapitalised on some missed tackles\nto score under the posts and take a\nslender one-point lead. Aware that\nthey couldn\u2019t allow the game to\nslip away, IC knew that a madras-tic change was needed, resulting\nin local wasteman \u2018Harry Styles\nfresher\u2019 being brought on at scrum\nhalf. However, the One Direction\nIC headed was backwards, as a\nmessy turnover at the scrum saw\nHolloway run in a breakaway try\nto extend their lead to a dangerous\neight points.\nImperial\u2019s frustration was\nbeginning to overflow, which\nbecame apparent in the next phase\nas Russian fresher Ali Zaboronsky,\nprobably still fuming from his\ncountry\u2019s exclusion from the\nOlympics, tackled an opposition\nplayer clearly still in the air from the\nrestart. This resulted in an untimely\n10 minute sin-bin as well as being\nawarded DotD. With things\nseemingly going from bad to worse,\nIC captain Dave Nielson-Scott\nrallied the team with a series of\nhard-hitting runs,bhaji-ing through\nthe Holloway line and bouncing the\nbiggest plum pudding of a player\never to set foot on a rugby field.\nWith the sin bin period expiring\nand no more points conceded,\nImperial started stringing together\ngood phases of play, and edged\never closer to scoring a try which\nwould put them within a score of\nHolloway. Yet, as time ticked on,\nthe scoreline didn\u2019t alter, long phase\nplays and well formulated attacks all\nsuccumbing to silly errors.\nA sense of inevitability gripped the\nteam as they ruminated the thought\nof defeat. Just as the heavenly\nembrace of naan was coming,\na cruel twist of fate saw a rare\nHolloway foray into IC territory\nand uncharacteristic errors creep\ninto Imperial\u2019s defence. Shortly\nafterwards, insult was added to\ninjury as Holloway sent their winger\nover in the corner to round off a 25-12 upset. With hearts broken and\nprides bruised, IC need to recover,\nTikka good long look at themselves\nand bounce back next week in the\nleague to get their season back on\ntrack.\nHolloway\ncame\nout guns\nblazing in\nthe second\nhalf\nIs this allowed?

I always saw that as\na challenge.\nYou could bend those rulers a\nsurprising distance, nearly a hairpin,\nand they\u2019d spring back into their\noriginal shape. Go just a little far\nthough, and they\u2019d snap clean.\nOur planet\u2019s oceans, like a\nshatterproof ruler, can take a\nsurprising amount of abuse. Since\nthe Industrial Revolution, humans\nhave been pumping out carbon\ndioxide into the atmosphere at\never-increasing rates. However, not\nall of that carbon dioxide remains\nin the atmosphere. Roughly 28\npercent is taken up by plants during\nphotosynthesis and a further 26\npercent is absorbed by the oceans.\n2010 data estimates that 33.4\nbillion tonnes was released from\nburning fossil fuels and cement\nmanufacture; a further 3.3 billion\ntonnes was released due to land use\nchange, such as deforestation. Nine\nbillion tonnes of that ends up in the\nocean.\nCarbon dioxide dissolves in water\nforming weak carbonic acid. For\n300 million years our oceans have\nmaintained a pH of 8.2 making\nthem slightly basic. Since the\n1800s, that pH has dropped to an\naverage of 8.1 \u2013 it\u2019s not an especially\ndramatic change in 200 years.That\u2019s\nbecause the ocean functions as a\ngiant chemical buffer.\nChemical buffers are able to resist\npH changes. Add a bit of acid or\nbase to a buffer solution and it will\nbe neutralised. In the ocean, various\ncarbonate compounds help to\nneutralise the carbonic acid formed\nby dissolving carbon dioxide. Ocean\nchemistry is complex and not fully\nunderstood, but what is clear is\nthat this buffer system is looking\nstrained.\nLike a shatterproof ruler, there is a\npoint of no return: a point where the\nocean can no longer neutralise all of\nthis excess carbon dioxide.\nIn other words, we\u2019re living on\nborrowed time. We\u2019ve been spared Whats beyond the horizon for the ecological health of our oceans? Photo Credit: Wikipedia\nSamuel Lickiss\nWriter\nOcean\nacditiy is\npredicted\nto increase\nby a factor\nof five by\n2100\nForgotten Oceans\nOcean acidifcation tests the limits of our seas, bringing them to an irreversible\nbreaking point\nthe worst impacts of climate change\nby the great ocean buffer.\nSo why is ocean acidification\na problem? Many invertebrates\nbuild their exoskeletons out of\ncalcium carbonate. This is the same\nchemical found in limestone, and\nit\u2019s vulnerable to acid erosion. You\ncan see the effects of acid rain on\nlimestone buildings throughout the\nworld, or you can experiment by\ndropping some vinegar on marble\nchips.\nA 2012 study in Nature found\nthat pteropods, or sea butterflies, in\nthe Southern Ocean had extensive\ndamage to their shells from acid\nerosion. This is a trend that is\nlikely to continue, and the impacts\non marine ecosystems could be\ndevastating. Coral reefs are often\nconsidered the ocean\u2019s nurseries; a\nfertile breeding ground for many\nspecies of fish that in turn sustains\nhuman communities.\nCorals, like pteropods, build\ntheir exoskeletons from calcium\ncarbonate. Ocean acidification\nruns the risk of not only dissolving\nexisting corals, but also makes\nit harder for them to recover by\nlimiting the amount of calcium\ncarbonate that can be precipitated.\nWeaker corals are more vulnerable\nto tropical storms and cannot\nsustain the same volume of life that\nwe come to expect from them.\nAt its current rate, ocean acidity\nis predicted to increase by a\nfactor of five by the year 2100 to\nconcentrations capable of dissolving\nsea creatures\u2019 shells in just 45 days.\nMarine farmers of lobster and\nother invertebrates are rightly\nconcerned about this. Already,\nthe oyster industry in the Pacific\nNorthwest has struggled with high\nrates of oyster mortality due to\nocean acidification. A 2013 study\npublished in Geophysical Research\nLetters found that it is becoming\ntoo energetically expensive for\norganisms to build shells and\ngrowth rates were slowing.\nThe cold, polar seas are especially\nvulnerable because cold water is\nable to store more dissolved carbon\ndioxide.Oceans absorb,but they also\nemit carbon dioxide. Up until now,\nthe effect has been net absorption.\nHowever, the problem is not\nlimited to ocean acidification. With\nwarming seas,the fear is that carbon\ndioxide-saturated oceans will be\nforced to give up vast quantities\nof their stored gas. If cold polar\nseawater is saturated with carbon\ndioxide, as that water warms some\nOur\nplanet\u2019s\noceans,\nlike a\nshatterproof ruler,\ncan take a\nsurprising\namount of\nabuse\nof that gas will no longer remain\nstorage. Mass emissions of carbon\ndioxide from the oceans itself has\nthe potential to cause accelerated\nclimate change at rates we have not\nyet experienced.\nAs with ocean acidification, we\nhave been spared the worst of\nthe effects so far. This is because\nthe oceans are not just a chemical\nbuffer. They are also resistant\nto temperature change. While\natmospheric temperatures have\nincreased by about 0.6\u00b0C over the\npast century, in the oceans this\nchange has only been about 0.1\u00b0C.\nThis is because water has what we\ncall a high specific heat capacity \u2013 it\nfunctions as a storage heater, storing\nheat for long periods of time.\nLike the ruler, there\u2019s a limit. As a\nspecies, are we really willing to find\nout where that limit is? Last week,\na study published in Science found\nthat much attention had been paid\nto the effects of climate change on\nland and in the atmosphere, but\nlittle on the ocean. We\u2019re beginning\nto understand the economic and\necological impacts of climate change\nin the oceans, but a co-ordinated\nresponse from world governments\nhas been limited.\nThey\u2019ve been taking up the strain\nfor a long time. Now the oceans are\nbeginning to tire.\nThe Secrets of Seduction\nFemale mice take the power of seduction in thier own hands, and re-brand a thier\nown flirtatious fragrance\nElizabeth Riach\nWriter\nS\nweat, urine and other\nbodily fluids have long been\nknown to be the designer\nperfumes and colognes\nof the animal world. Chemical\nsignals known as pheromones can\nmodify the behaviour and biology\nof other individuals. They can act as\ndeterrants between males through\nmarking territory or establishing\ndominance.\nAlternatively, pheromones can\nturn up the allure by attracting\nFemale\nmice have\na way of\ncombatting\nunwanted\nmale cues\n\u2022 The first pheromone was discovered in 1953. It was named \u201cbombykol\u201d and is used by female\nsilkworm moths to attract males over large distances (sometimes as much as 10km)\n\u2022 The term pheromone is derived from the Greek words \u201cpheran\u201d (to transfer) and \u201chorman\u201d (to excite)\n\u2022 Mammals detect pheromones through the VNO (vomeronasal organ) situated in the nose and\nconnected to the mid-brain\n\u2022 Humans have been found to have a severely reduced or absent VNO, and so if we respond to\nchemical signaling it\u2019s mostly through our normal olfactory (sense of smell) system\n\u2022 There is still limited scientific evidence that there are human pheromones, despite the existence of\n\u201clove potions\u201d containing pheromones being sold online. Most of these concoctions actually use pig\npheromones\n\u2022 Under stressful conditions such as increased carbon dioxide levels, mice can release alarm pheromones\nthat cause other mice in near proximity to freeze in order to conserve oxygen.The chemical identity of\nthis compound remains unknown\nMice uniting over urine; females \u201csexy scents\u201d attract the male. Photo Credit:\npixabay\npotential mates. In this way, it\nis usually a signal between two\nmembers of the same species, where\nboth the sender and receiver get\nmutual benefits. This benefit isn\u2019t\nalways sex - in insects, pheromones\nmay act in order to cause them to\ngather in an aggregation, raise an\nalarm or even trigger a chain of\ndevelopmental effects.\nA new study published a few days\nago by Washington University has\nisolated the exact two compounds\nthat sexually arouse male mice,\nacting through the delightful\nmedium of female urine. Just by\nwatching mice behaviour, it is\nobvious that these chemicals are\npresent in female urine compared to\nthat of males. Whereas males stop\nto investigate excretions of potential\nmates, they swiftly pass on after\nencountering a rival male\u2019s marking,\nas well as urine from female mice\nwith no ovaries.\nBy looking at which compounds\nwithin the urine causes \u201csmell\u201d\nneurons to fire within the male\nmouse nose, the two \u201csexy scents\u201d\nwere distinguished from the other\ncompounds in the urine. These\nchemicals elicit sexual behaviour in\ntheir male mice counterparts.When\nthese chemicals were added to male\nurine and ovary-less female urine,\nan increase in sexual male behaviour\nwas observed as well as prolonged\ninterest in the urine itself. Each\nof these stimulating aromas seem\nto have slightly different messages\nto convey to the interested male.\nOne reassures the male that the\nmouse is female, and the other that\nshe is ovulating and ready to mate.\nInterestingly, these scents do little\nfor the male libido when isolated\n- they only change male sexual\nbehaviour when both are present.\nThe chemicals are waste products\nof the female\u2019s steroid metabolism,\nand act as a form of communication\nfrom the internal environment of\nthe female mouse to the external\nreceptor of the male mice nose. In\nthis way,it tells males which females\nare sexually active so they don\u2019t\nwaste time and energy pursuing\ninfertile mates. Although these\nchemicals don\u2019t give us the whole\nanswer to mice sexual responses,\nthey give us some insight into the\nneurobiology of mice behaviour.\nThis communication works\nboth ways, however, and another\nAmerican study published in July\nearlierthisyearhasfoundthatfemale\nmice have a way of combatting\nunwanted male cues.Non-ovulating\nfemales can actually block irrelevant\nmale sexual signaling.This is known\nas sensory silencing, and works via\nhormones such as progesterone\nblocking out the receptors required\nto sense sex-related chemicals. The\nsame research team is looking at\nwhether the human sense of smell\nis in any way altered in response to\noscillating hormonal levels.\nIn the past, pheromone-receptor\ninteractions have been hard to\nstudy in mammals due to the fact\nthey are often released in very small\nquantities. This is in comparison\nto insects, which have been under\nscrutiny for around 60 years.Studies\nhave identified insect pheromones,\ntheir receptors and even the neural\npathways behind them. The reason\nfor such extensive study on insect\npheromones is due to the use of\nthem for trapping and monitoring\ninsect levels in crop fields and\norchards worldwide. More research\nis required to truly understand\nthe workings of mammalian\npheromones to this extent. Boars\nhave also been under intense study\nfor pheromonal excretions.\nNonovulating\nfemales\ncan actually\nblock\nirrelevant\nmale sexual\nsignaling\nCaptured in a container, the more females spray the more they get .

They were now the three\nprincipal French ideals: liberty,\nequality, and fraternity; however it\nseems that as of Saturday morning\nFacebook has now appropriated\nthese colours to signify self-indulgence, egotistic tendencies,\nand a disingenuous compassion for\nthe tragedy of others.\nAt the time of writing, 129 lives\nhave been lost as a result of the\nthree co-ordinated attacks on\nFriday night in Paris leading to the\nfirst national state of emergency in\nFrance since 2005. This is terrorism\nnot occurring thousands of miles\naway, causing asylum seekers to flee\ntheir homes; this is on our European\ndoorstep and Islamic extremism is a\nthreat that must be countered with\nincreased awareness and increased\nsecurity. However, the one thing\nthat we can do without, and one\nthing that will not aid this war is\nthe option to temporarily change\nour profile pictures.\nFacebook, as a social media outlet,\nhas increasingly been trying to\nhumanise its interface by attempting\nto transmit empathy through a\ncomputer screen, however, the end\nresult is as far away from human\nempathy as possible. The fact that\nit was only when tragedy struck a\nwestern nation that Facebook felt\nthe need to remind us to show our\nsupport\u2019 is in itself offensive. On\nthe 12th\nof November there were\nmultiple suicide bombings leading\nto estimated deaths of 43 people;\nhowever the overlay of Lebanon\u2019s\nred and white with a tree in the\nmiddle was not offered to anyone.\nMy problem is not with the idea\nof showing support towards those\naffected by the tragedy in Paris,\nbut rather the false sentiment that\nthey show solidarity, leading to the\nidea of being socially conscious\nor compassionate as a \u201cme too\u201d\nactivity rather than people actually\nconsciously thinking about the\nlarger issues at hand. Instead\nof considering how our social\nlandscape is changing,how that may\naffect the way security is run in our\ncountry, or even campaigning for\nour government to make a greater\neffort in taking in asylum seekers,all\nthat is occurring is a careless click of\na mouse.\nIf there was ever a sign that\nthis action was one of the most\ndisingenuous actions of recent\ntimes,just look down your newsfeed\nat how many people were quick\nto change it back to their original\npicture once supporting France was\nno longer the zeitgeist. To clarify,\nhowever, I believe that Facebook is\nthe one whose motives are morally\ncontentious, treating France\u2019s\ntragedy as a plaything. I would ask:\nif people are actually inclined to\nshow solidarity with France, would\nthey be prepared to do more than\nclick a button on their home page?\nThis is everyone\u2019s fight\nJeremy Hunt\u2019s plans for junior doctor contracts will affect the care you receive\nSarah Sturrock\nWriter\nFacebook\nhas now\nappropriated\nthese\ncolours\nI\n\u2019m aware that the media\nand Facebook may have\nrecently reached saturation\nwith heartfelt pleas for help\nfrom the medic community. I\nhave undoubtedly littered friends\u2019\ntimelines with tearjerking videos,\nangry statistic-riddled rants and\nprotest photos. However, Jeremy\nHunt still refuses to listen and I\nbelieve you, the voting public and\nNHS patients, deserve to know\nwhat\u2019s happening. I hope you might\neven join the debate.\nThere are many ways in which\nthe new contracts will be damaging\nto doctors\u2019 personal lives and bank\naccounts, but I\u2019m writing today to\ntell you the most important part:\nit will affect the care you receive\nas an NHS patient. Currently,\ntrusts are penalised financially for\ngiving doctors rotas that include\nan excessive number of \u2018antisocial\u2019\nhours. Consequently, doctors\nretain some circadian rhythm and,\ngenerally, are able to care for their\nmental and physical health as any\nprofessional would expect to do.\nUnder Jeremy Hunt\u2019s proposals,\nthese penalties will be removed.\nInstead of this proactive, financial\nincentive for NHS Trusts to\nensure safe working hours, Jeremy\nwould rather that our rotas are\nsporadically monitored by the\nCare Quality Commission or\nthat juniors themselves become\nthe whistleblowers. This means\nthat any unsafe rotas would only\nbe picked up retrospectively, and\nhence dangerous mistakes may\nhave already been made. Although\nassurances have been made by NHS\nemployers that the working hours\nwill not be extreme, rotas released\non their own website show the\nopposite, with isolated night shifts\nin the middle of plenty of 13-hour\ndays.\nSo, what is the justification\nfor this? Jeremy has masterfully\nmisrepresented evidence published\nin the BMJ, claiming that patients\nare more likely to die if admitted\nat the weekend because there are\nless staff working on Saturdays and\nSundays \u2013 and hence, junior doctors\napparently need to take on more\nhours, and more antisocial hours,\nwithin the pay envelope. However,\nthere was merely a statistical excess\nof deaths at the weekend \u2013 the\nauthors themselves admitted it\nwould be \u201crash and misleading\u201d\nto assume that these are avoidable\ndeaths.\nThere is a lot more to say on\nthis topic, and I would welcome\nany Imperial students who would\nlike to know more to peruse the\nBMA\u2019s website, or contact me for\nmore information. We want to\ngive you the best care we can, and\nthat requires us to have a safe, fair\ncontract.\nJunior doctors will now stage a walk-out.

To defeat\nterrorism we need a well thought\nout and multilateral response.\nInstead, on Saturday, Francois\nHollande responded with a futile\nact of revenge.By bombing ISIS and\ndeclaring war, we prove their world\nview, that the world is black and\nwhite, and play into the insidious\nnarrative of us versus them.\nJust two days after the death of\n132 innocent civilians, the French\nmilitary launched fresh strikes on\nthe ISIS stronghold of Raqqa in\nSyria. There is no doubt that the\nmilitants killed in this attack were\nawful human beings, but it\u2019s sad\nthat so soon after a tragedy we\nare willing to respond with such\ndestructive violence. It seems as if\nthe violence of the west is far more\npalatable than those who oppose\nus. We should treat all murder with\nsimilar disgust.\nMoreover, we must question\nthe effectiveness of airstrikes\nin combating ISIS in Iraq and\nSyria. The American and French\nbombing campaigns seem to have\ndone little to stop the terror that\nISIS create. In fact, they seem to\nhave inspired more people to join\nthe terrorist group. Airstrikes are\nmerely a simple, public appeasing,\nand largely inadequate solution to a\ncomplex problem. So, it\u2019s worrying\nthat David Cameron now seeks\nto involve Britain in the same\nnationalistic display of military\npower.\nWhen we drop death from\nabove, it invariably results in the\nslaughter of innocent civilians.\nNot only is it immoral, but when\nyou kill someone\u2019s brother, aunt,\nor grandmother you are likely to\ncreate more allies for ISIS on the\nground. Although we don\u2019t do it\nintentionally, we arbitrarily value\ncertain lives over others and we\ncontinue to justify accidental deaths\nas necessary by-products of war.\nThe recent attack on the Kunduz\nhospital in Afghanistan that left\n22 dead proves that our military is\nnot yet capable of reducing civilian\ncasualties to \u2018acceptable\u2019 levels.\nSometimes the people we attack\nhave already proven their guilt. But\ninstead of bringing the perpetrators\nof heinous attacks to account, we\nrespond with wrath and fury. In\nthese cases we have the ability to\ntruly distinguish ourselves from the\nbarbarity of our enemies.\nThe last thing ISIS want us to do\nis to bring them to trial and surely\nin the case of Mohammed Emwazi\n(Jihadi John), a British citizen, we\nshould have dealt with their crimes\nunder British law, rather than under\nstate-conducted vigilantism.\nIf we allow the warmongering\nrhetoric of our leaders and media to\ncontinue then we will never be able\nto defeat terrorism in its current\nform. A single civilian casualty\nshould never be accepted nor should\nwe respond with vengeance. We\ncannot play into the hands of ISIS;\nthey yearn for a world of absolutes\nwithout a grey area in between.\nThe modern way of dealing with crises\nFacebook\u2019s \u2018I\u2019m safe\u2019 button and French flag filters have divided critics\nPhilip Kurukgny\nWriter\nWe\narbitrarily\nvalue\ncertain\nlives over\nothers\nI\nn the deadliest attack on\nFrench soil since WWII,\npanic and chaos unfolded in\nthe French capital this week.\nMany people were left worried that\ntheir relatives, family and friends\nhad been amongst those murdered\nor injured.\nIn what initially was a welcome\nmove, Facebook launched the \u2018I\u2019m\nsafe\u2019 button for people to confirm\nvia social media that they were\nokay. Previously used by Facebook\nduring natural disasters, the button\u2019s\nuse has expanded during the Paris\nattacks to encompass human\nconflict.Facebook has since received\ncriticism because the button was\nnot made available to people in\nthe Beirut bombings that killed 43\nthe day before the Paris attacks.\nTheories surfaced online about how\n\u2018French lives are more valuable than\nArab ones\u2019, which fueled the debate\non inequality.\nIn a statement, Facebook called\nits safety check a \u201crelatively new\nfeature\u201d.\n\u201cThe product will continue to\nevolve as we learn more about how\nit\u2019s used during different crises. We\nhope to never be confronted with a\nsituation like this again,but if we are,\nwe are of course open to activating\nthe tool given how reassuring it has\nbeen for people in Paris\u201d.\nFacebookalsolaunchedtheFrench\nflag filter which I\u2019m sure readers\nwill be familiar with; many of your\nfriends showing solidarity with the\nFrench people by applying the filter\nto their profile picture. Lebanese\nbloggers criticised Facebook for\nnot making a Lebanese flag filter\navailable. The filter has also been\ncriticised by some people, as being\nnot the most appropriate to show\nsupport to the French people, since\nfew of those who have that filter\nactivated know any victim of the\nattacks and that it\u2019s just something\nto boost one\u2019s appeal on social\nmedia. We live in a world where\nshowing your picture with the filter\nis a political statement, that echoes\nthrough social media. It signals\nsolidarity with the French people,\nwith the idea that collectively we are\nstronger and that wherever we can,\nwe will help each other. It\u2019s hard to\njudge people\u2019s intentions in times of\ncrisis, but the debate about the role\nof social media in a time of crisis has\ncertainly been revived.\nIt\u2019s sad to see we live in a world\nwhere we need to check in on\nFacebook to say we\u2019re safe from\nmonstrous nihilistic ideology rather\nthan check in a nice French bistro at\nthe heart of Paris.We do live in dark\ntime but we must carry on with our\nway of living or the attackers\u2019 goals\nof generating fear and disruption\nwill have succeeded.\nStaff attended the minute of silence at Imperial this week.
