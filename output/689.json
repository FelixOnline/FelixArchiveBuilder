Fielding a slightly under\nstrength team, good performances were put\nin all round. P March, M Wainwright and M Budzinki did well to get to the last sixteen of\nthe Kumike, which was won by Sheriff Amin.\nC Nappura was second in the mens Kata\nwhilst Belinda Walker just failed to take the\nhonours in the ladies Kata, fin in shing second. Both A and B teams were quite\noutstanding, and it was a pity they had to\nmeet in the first qualifying round. After an\ninspired effort only a team of Black Belts\nfrom Eastlegth snatched the trophy from the\ngrasp of the A team. The Budokwai ladies\nmade a clean sweep in the ladies Kumite,\nfinishing first and second, and mention must\nalso be made of the team members who put\nin sterling performances, J Rowlands, Ping\nChung and Adrian Bradley. As a confidence\nbuilder for the University Championships\nnext Saturday the tournament was a great\nsuccess, and not to forget the grading and\nDinner on December 5th.

    "content": "CLETTERS\nOUR\nLAS appeal\nDear Sir\nFollowing recent actions taken by the\nUnion Executive (UE) which have resulted in\na temporary banning of the Latin American\nSociety (LAS), a few remarks are in order:\n1. As stated in a letter to LAS from MrI Bull dated November 13 1984 (copy\nenclosed) and confirmed by the Appeals\nCommittee today, the decision to ban LAS was taken on the grounds of running an\n'unauthorised' bar and not clearing union\npremises on Saturday November 10 after a event organised by the Latin American\nCulture Centre (LACC) \u2014 and sponsored by\nLAS.2. An 'unauthorised' bar is any sale within\nunion premises of alcoholic drinks not\nbought from the union and sold without\nunion permission. It is widely known that\n'unauthorised' bars are nothing new in union\npremises, not even in parties attended by\nmembers of the Union Executive.\nAlthough not knowing the regulations is\nnot an excuse for not complying to them, it is\nsurprising such a sudden change in union\n'policies' on this matter.\nThis topic of'policies' takes me to the next\npoint.\n3. It is clear from a letter sent by MrI Bull\nto the Chairman of LAS on October 22\n(enclosed) that actions taken against LAS are\ninfluenced by events which occured in\nprevious sessions under different union\nexecutives! Events which, by the way, were\npositively solved for LAS It is indeed very easy to prejudge this kind\nof situation when second hand information\nfrom unknown sources is available.\n4. The event of Saturday November 10\nwas booked under a \u00a3150 deposit and \u00a3100\nfor hiring of union premises and \u00a340 for\nadditional security. The deposit has been\nkept by the union as part of the action against\nLAS. Although union premises were returned in\nquite a good condition on November 10, it\nseems to me that \u00a3250 for residual cleaning is\nenough to do the job at the new quality le ve.1 required by the union officials.\nOn the other hand, the mere fact of\ncharging \u00a3100 for hiring union premises in\nany event implies that it is not an IC Club or\nSociety event. It would otherwise be against\nthe very much called for Union regulations.\nThe LAS acted solely as an intermediary,\nhappy to see the event taking place at IC, and\nLA CC acted as a private user of union\nfacilities and therefore payed for it, although\nthis was not a profitable event the LA CC being a charity. Such was the agreement.\nIf the Union Exectuive does not welcome\nsuch events, why was it given the green light\nin the first place? Why charge a \u00a3100 and\ncome to an agreement? This was the mistake.\nAnd taking action a posterior i against LAS seems a very dubious way of setting a new\nprecedent and correcting an error.\nThe Appeals Committee has ruled out that\nthe ban imposed on LAS is to remain for\nseveral weeks and the \u00a3150 deposit to be kept\nby the Union. It appears that the committee\njust did not appreciate the previous remarks.\nIt might be relevant to point out here that\n95% of the members of LAS are adults doing\npost-graduate research at IC who run the\nsociety at a very limited budget. It might be a mistake to expect to deal like adults with\npeople in the union.\nIf this ban is to remain as it is, I expect to\nsee the \u00a3100 fee for hiring union premises\ngiven back to LAS in order to be consist ant with union constitutional regulations. Or is\nthe union going to profit from its own\nsocieties?\nI would very much like to see the Union\nExecutive reconsidering their position.\nYours sincerely\nLA Zenteno\nMember of LAS\nCarnival\nChaos\nDear Sir\nLast Fridays Guilds Carnival, despite, or\nperhaps because of its being run entirely by\nIC Entertainments Committee, with\nremarkably little help or encouragement\nfrom Guilds, was an outstanding succ ces s. Although the admission price, was, at \u00a33.50,\nremarkably cheap for such an event, the\nCarnival managed to make a small profit, a considerable improvement on recent years.\nThe highlight of the evening was\nundoubtedly Mud's performance, which was\necstatically received by all those present.\nWhat most people didn't realise, however,\nwas that Les Gray, Mud's lead singer and the\nonly original member of the group, was\nalmost not allowed into the Carnival at all.\nWhen he arrived at the front door ai 9.30pm, rather later than expected, the people on the\ndoor, thinking he was having them on,\nrefused to believe that he was in fact Les\nGray, and wouldn't, let him in without\npaying. The rest of the evening, however,\npassed without any further hitches, and so\ncongratulations are due to all those who took\npart \u2014 in particular Charlie Troup, the\nGuilds Ents Chairman, who had the\nawesome responsibility of running the whole\nevent.\nThe questions that must be asked,\n. however, is why Guilds should take any of\nthe credit for an event to which they\ncontributed absolutely nothing, with the\nFELIX Next Friday there is no FELIX, but there\nwill be an extra-special, bumper Christmas\nissue on the following Wednesday, December\n12.\nAnybody with cartoons, jokes, humorous\narticles, letters and so on, should drop them\nin to the FELIX Office.\nThe deadline for the last issue (small ads,\ndiary entries, clubs, letters) is Wednesday 5\nDecember.\nAcknowlegements: Ajay, Nigel, Grenville,\nPete, Hugh, Martin, Jon, Richard, Finian,\nTinker, Peter, all the ICCAG people, Andy,\nProf Grootenhuis, Rosemary, Tony and all the\ncolla tors, especially Chris Martin and the IC\nRadio mob, Farrah and Hugh.\nFelix is published by the Editor for and on behalf of\nImperial College Union Publications Board and is printed\nby the Union Print Unit, Imperial College, PrinceConsort\nRoad, London SW7.\n'Telephone 01-589 5111 Ext 3515 '\nEditor: David Rowe, Business Manager: Martin Taylor,\nAdvertising Manager: Paul Belford.\nCopyright FELIX 1984. ISSN 10140-0711.\nnotable exception of Mr Troup, who is,\nsignificantly, also a member of IC Ents. Of\nthose Guilds people who came along on\nFriday afternoon as helpers, so gaining free\nentry, only a fraction turned up later in the\nevening to move the band's equipment out,\nand none stayed to clear up afterwards\n(contrary to the claims made in Guildsheet\nthis week), both these jobs being ones that\nGuilds were specifically asked to do. The\nbarbeque, the single biggest money spinner at\nany carnival (and remembering that the\nprofits from this carnival are donated to Rag)\nwas also meant to be run by Guilds, and as a result failed to take place. A representative at\nIC Ents commented afterwards that the\nGuilds Exec seemed to think it enough to\nturn up late on in the evening, getting in free\nbecause of their union position, and then\nbask in the success of an event at which they\nhad not even once offered to help.\nYours faithfully,\nDisgruntled\n(real name with eId by request)\nDear Sir\nHaving read the letters, features, opinions\netc, etc, of the last few weeks I have decided to\nurge anyone with an IQ greater than that of a carrot to join the Society for the elimination\nof Peurile Twats from Imperial College.\nAnyone who thinks I'm taking the piss need\nnot apply.\nYours in utter contempt of all semi-evolved life\nforms\nTony Wildish\nPhysics PG\nFriday 30 November 1984 FELIX\n\n"

    "content": "PHOTO\nChristmas\nCompetition\nJust a quick reminder about our slide show\nnext Tuesday (see Diary) featuring two of the\nmore important of Modern British\nPhotographers. We had a great turn out last\nmonth, so let's see you all back again.\nAnyone can come, you can become a member at the meeting. You all missed a terrific morning out at the Syon Butterfly\nhouse (sorry about the short notice), but no\nbother, there'll be another trip next term,\nwhen it'll be even warmer and more fruitful\nthan before. If some of you haven't heard of\nthis place, it's a large green house, full of\ntropical greenery with many large exotic\nbutterflies flying around. They're quite tame\nand accessible, so it's easy to take\nphotographs; it's one of the most interesting\nways to start close -up photography, even\nwith the minimum of equipment.\nIn the meantime there'll be a couple of\ncompetitions run next term. The first, judged\nin the third and fourth week of term, will be\nfor Colour/B& W, slides/prints, on the\nsubject of Christmas (ses u lato), ie quality\nsnaps from the coming holiday. The other\nwill be a double competition, about midway\nthrough next term. On one hand, you can\nenter a portfolio of three photos that best\nrepresent your abilities, or you can enter a portrait, of whoever you like, or dislike. The\nportrait can be included in the portfolio, but\nthey must all be prints. Most people join the\nsociety to use the darkrooms, so let's see the\nresults of this use, even if you've just started.\nThey are judged not only on technical merit,\nbut also originality and creativity. There will\npossibly be prizes for this competition, and\nwinning entries will be published in FELIX, or\neven The Phoenix. Incidentally, if you have\nany photos you think may be newsworthy or\ninteresting in anyway, don't hesitate to take\nthem to the Editor, as Felix Photographers\ncan't be at every event during term.\nWEIGHTS\nBetter body\nIf you would like to have a better\nconditioned, stronger, more attractive body\nor raise your athletic performance to new\nheights then weight training is for you. Most\npeople think of weight training only as a way\nof gaining large powerful muscles. Certainly\nweight training is the very best way to\nachieve this but this narrow image of weights\ntraining prevents many people who would\nlike to look and feel at their best from\nrealising the potential of weight training for\nthem. Weight training allows you to shape,\ntone and strengthen the entire physique,\nwhile gaining or losing weight according to\nyour individual requirements. By\nappropriate application of weight training\nanyone in normal health can take giant steps\nin a matter of months towards achieving their\nideal physique and the sense of physical and\nmental well-being which goes with it.\nWeight training achieves this through the\nprinciples known as progressive overload.\nStarting well within your own capacity you\nincrease the weight used in various\nexercises, carefully designed to work\nparticular muscles group's, until the level at\nwhich the muscles is just overloaded is\nreached. This overload causes the\nbreakdown of muscle tissue stimulating the\nbody to replenish and rebuild the muscle to\nwithstand the stress imposed. As you\nprogressively increase the load the body is\nconstantly provoked into replenishing and\nrenewing the tissue so that you assume a strength and vitality which previously you\ncould only dream about. With regular\ntraining two to four times a week, a man\nstarting weight training can readily double his\nstrength in about a year. For a woman the\nincrease in strength will probably not be so\ngreat but the increase in tone, physical\nvitality and poise will be rapid and evident.\nThe purpose of the weights club is to\nprovide you with the facilities and advice\nneeded to achieve these highly desirable\nresults. It provides facilities to train using free\nweights (bar bells and dumb-bells) with\nadvice on how to construct a training\nprogram appropriate to your particular\nneeds. If you would like to join the weights\nclub or find out more about its activities then\ncome to its AGM, Union Lower Refectory,\n12.45pm, Thurs Dec 6.\nCHRISTIAN\nHouseparty at\nElm Tree Farm\nEarly Friday evening, an eager bunch of\nabout 30 members of the CU departed on\nour mid-term house party. This was designed\nto give everybody a chance to get to know\neach other better, to provide a well earned\n(in some cases) break from work, and to try\nto discover something of what the Lord\nwants us to do in College. Elm Tree farm is\nnear Ashford in Kent and consists of\ncottages set near the old farm-house. It is let\nout to Christain Groups throughout the\nyear. We were accompanied by Ken Mc\nGreavey, who is a member of the ICTHUS\nFellowship, an organisation in South\nLondon, concerned with the setting up of\nchurches in areas where there is not\nevangelistic Christian witness. Ken led our\nmeetings on the theme of'Hearing the Voice\nof the Lord'.\nOur coach journey took about -two hours\nand we got to the farm at about 8.00pm. There was now a slight delay as our cooks\n(last year's CU president and his wife) had\nnot arrived, and they also had our food! They\narrived soon after, however, and gave us a CLUBS\ntypical CU meal of Bread and Chesse and\nPate . We finished off the Friday evening with\na time of worship and praise. The other\nmajor panic of the evening took place when\nour Glorious leader 2nd Lt Roger Preece\nREME left his rubber duck outside by the\ncoach. Both rubber duck and 2nd Lt were\nhappily reunited soon after, however!\nSaturday morning started off with a prayer-meeting for the keen and a lie-in for the lazy.\nAfter breakfast, Ken led the first of our\nmeetings. One of the things that\ncharacterises the ICTHUS fellowship is a belief in the power of God and how it is still\nexpressed today. Ken stressed this very\nmuch in all our meetings. Apart from lunch\nthe rest of the day, until about 5.00pm was\nfree. Some people went for a walk, but the\nhighlight of the day was the Chem Eng end of\nthe World football match. This titanic\nstruggle was on the neighbouring field and\ninvolved getting as muddy as possible. The\ngame was highlighted by the performance of\nJo and Sarah. Jo, tastefully outfitted in her\nrainbow well ies, scored a hat-trick, which\nsays a lot about the Chem Eng goal keeping! Sarah tried very hard and succeeded in\nscoring twice, although one was through her\nown goal! The final score was Chem Eng 12\nRest of the World 15 which was considered\nto be a fair result.\nThe rest of the afternoon was spent\npreparing for our entertain e ment in the\nevening, which took place after another\nmeeting and supper. The highlight of the\nshow was Roger's dynamic singing of the\nblues. Next time, though, he should\nremember to write some lyrics first! Other\nmemorable perform aces included Alec and\nSarah's playing of some traditional folkmusic on med odium and violin. One of the\nmost noticeable things about the week-end\nwas the amount of musical talent in the CU. Unfortunately the dancing would have been\nbetter had the dancers not burst into\nhysterics. Also Derek's impression of a man-eating carrot was something not to be\nmissed. We ended Saturcday night with a time of prayer to focus our attention on our\nrole in College and how as individuals we fit\ninto the CU. Sunday morning began like Saturday with\nthe lazy staying in bed till breakfast. We then\npacked up and had our last meeting. In this\nmeeting Ken concluded all that he had been\nsaying, by talking about how God uses the\ngifts of his Sprirt to talk and minister to us.\nSome of us experienced His blessing in\ndifferent ways and some of us were healed. I used to be very cynical about this thing and Id are say some of you who are reading this\nari tic le feel the same way. All I can say is\ncome along and have a look for yourself.\nAfter the end of the meeting we had lunch\nand cleared up before getting the coach back\nto College. Thank you to Cheryl and Clive\nfor organ in sing the week-end, and I hope our\nnext one is so enjoyable. I will leave with two\nun-answered questions posed by the\nweekend.\n1) -where did Mark and Sarah buy their\nsweaters?\n2) Where is Roger's duck?\nFELIX Friday 30 November 1984 11\n\n"

    "content": "FEATURED\nCrisis\nat\nChristmas\nVisiting St Pancras\nThe thought of a spell in hospital is something which few people relish, and the\nrealisation that it might become home permanently can be a tremendous blow\nto many patients. To soften this blow, and break the monotony of hospital\nroutine, our volunteers descend on the wards of St Pancras on Wednesday\nafternoons and then... Well it's pretty much up to you. Chatting(or more often\nlistening), doing shopping, playing cards or chess with the patients are all week-to-week activities. Christmas is great fun; mammoth shopping expeditions to\nOxford Street stores are organised, and last year there were several lively trips\nto the V&A. The tea-table had to the seen to be believed!\nHospital visiting isn't for everyone, but it can be very rewarding for both\npatients and volunteers.O Venture\nChristmas is hard for the homeless.\nMany who usually go to stations, cheap\ncafes and day centres find these closed\nat Christmas. There is nowhere to keep\nwarm, and nothing to do. CRISIS aims\nto improve the lot of the homeless and\nlonely. One of the ways it goes about\ndoi ung this, and the one that is most\npublicised, is to open up a centre over\nChristmas to provide shelter, warmth,\nplenty of food and a touch of the festive\nspirit for anyone who drops in.\nThe 1983 'Open Christmas' was held\nin a vacant warehouse supplied by the\nGLC. Two weeks earlier it had been a gaunt, bare place. Then coconut\nmatting and coloured lights were\ninstalled, balloons and paper chains\nhung, and the place began to look more\nhomely. Over 400 volunteers were\ndirectly involved and many more in the\npre ceding national campaign.\nVolunteers were employed in the\nkitchens preparing food, in the clothes\nstore sizing garments, as well as in\ncleaning and providing company for the\nguests. All this happened 24 hours a day\nduring the Open period.\nThe 'Open' lasts for about a week,\nproviding basic care and friendship at a time when others are sharing Christmas\nwith their families. Although some\naccuse it of being a 'seven-day wonder'\nit does fill a gap. It is not attempting to\ntake over the work of projects that are\nopen all year round and, because it is\nshort-lived, it can operate without all\nthe rules and restrictions that\npermanent places require. This means\nthat homeless people who would\nnormally avoid hostels will come along\nfor somewhere to sleep, something to\neat and some new clothes. No questions\nare asked, no names are taken.\nBut crisis does not just operate at\nChristmas. With the money they raise in\nthe Christmas campaign they support\nover 50 projects nationally ranging from night shelters providing the most basic\naccommodation, to rehabilitation\nschemes and day centres.\u2022\n\u2022If you would like to be involved in CRISIS at\nChristmas either directly (by lending a hand\nin the preparation, the actual 'Open' or the\nclean-up operation) or indirectly (taking part\nin the collection that will be in College on\nDecember 4, or attending the CRISIS carol\nconcert at Southwark Cathedral December\n9) please drop into the ICCA G Office next\nMonday lunchtime.\nClub\nThe :'\\ct on Saturday Venture Club is\nrun for physically and mentally\nhandicapped children be tr wen the ages\nof 5 and 21, to which IC has sent\nvolunteers for several years.\nAlthough the club is based in Acton,\nexcursions are frequent Recently the\nchildren have visited Boulogne, a local\nfire station and Chessington Zoo.\nThe club has many facilities including\na playground, costumes, toys and a kitchen (a strong stomach is required\nfor sampling the delights produced\nthere!).\nMany join the club having no previous\nexperience of working with children or\nthe handicapped, but it is impossible not\nto feel welcomed and to find the time\nspent with the children rewarding.\nVolunteers just need to be energetic,\nwilling to listen and to have an endless\nvariety of answers to the children's favourite question, 'But why?'.0\nHopefully this has given you an insight\ninto the activities with which ICCA G is\nalready involved. Several new projects\nthat the group will be starting soon\ninclude an association with Age\nConcern, and a link with a battered\nwives' hostel. If you think you might\nenjoy a king an elderly person out\nshopping (or down to their local) or if\nyou're good at coping with kids, these\nmight interest you.\nA regular commit t ment to help is not\nalways necessary (the soup run is a good\nexample). One-offs last year included a trip to the Royal Mews for five otherwise\nhousebound people, which went d won extremely well, and of course we're\nalways at Rag Fete.\nWe welcome any ideas on how to\nexpand the group, get more people\ninvolved, look into new areas of work.\nPlease feel free to contact the\ncommittee at any time if you'd like to\nknow more, or get involved. It costs\nnothing to join ICCA G, except what is\nat Imperial, the most valuable\ncommodity \u2014 time. We've found out\nthat it's worth a few hours a week\u2014we\nhope you will, too.\nFELIX Friday 30 November 1984 9\n\n"

    "content": "COPINION\nEducation \u2014\nan investment in the future\nThe proposals of Sir Keith Joseph to alter the system of grants\nrepresent the biggest change in higher education for many years.\nHere Tony Atkins and Abigail Levin of IC SDP Society consider the\nchanges and their implications.\nAs you are probably aware, Sir Keith Joseph\nhas recently proposed the abolition of the\nminimum grant, a significant steep e ning in\nthe rates of parental contribution and the\ndangerous precedent of parents having to\npay college fees. This follows a45% increase\nin the rates of parental contribution (for\nthose earning over \u00a313,000) and the\nintroduction of am easley \u00a3110 travel\nallowance this summer. These latest\nchanges were announced without any\nconsultation with NUS, the only available\nnational voice for students, or indeed with\nany group representing parents or colleges.\nThe British Higher Education system is\nunder increasing attack. We feel now is the\ntime to show the dangers of the present\ntrends in Government policy, and that a restatement of the principles on which our\neducation system is based is vitally\nimportant.\nIn 1943 the Beveridge Report summarised\nthe ideals to which our present Welfare State\naspires. The aim of welfare is to fight\nignorance, poverty, unemployment and\ndisease. The role of the State is to help create\na modern and efficient economy whose\nwealth is used to create a fair and just\nsociety. This society should educate its\npeople independently of their background,\nand education should be free at the time it is\nrequired. Funds for education should come\nfrom a national fund raised by taxation and\nadmin in ste red by Government, contribution\nto the fund being based on one's ability to pay\nand the recognition that education benefits\neveryone eventually. Education is a long-term investment in the individual's and hence\nthe nation's future, for a higher quality of life\nwe need a stronger economy and culture, for\nwhich we need a higher and more broadly-based overall level of education.\nThe bulk of funds in the 1960's and 50s were channeled into primary and secondary\neducation, so not until the influential Robbins\nReport in 1963 did the Higher Education\nsystem start to expand vigorously. Despite\nthe economic difficulties of the 1970s this\ntrend was continued, recognizing that\neconomic health is fuelled by an increasing\nlevel of education both in quantity and\nquality. Even so, Britain still has the lowest\nlevel of participation in Higher Education\namongst all our competitors. In the US over\n45% of young people take a degree of some\nsort and a far wider range of courses are\navailable. In Britain, Higher Education\nremains the privilege of an elite. If we are to\nmaintain and improve our current standard\nof living, we must have an expanding and\nhealthy education system- working with a broader range of student and courses. We\nare in the midst of an industrial revolution\nand we cannot afford to restrict the number\nof people being educated to cope with the\ntimes ahead of us.\nThe Government, however, continues to\ncut places and resources and imposes\nincreasing financial burdens on students and\nparents. This is bound to discourage\nparticipation in Higher Education.\nApparently there 'must' be cutbacks now on\nthe grounds of lack of resources and the\nfalling birthrate. Yet right now we are part of\nthe Baby Boom, and large numbers of school\nleave rs cannot find places at universities or\npolytechnics, despite qualifications that\nwould have easily been sufficient several\nyears ago. The lack of money is due solely to\npolicy, putting other areas of government\nexpenditure ahead of education in priority.\nThere is an alternative to this attitude. We\nshould maintain the present number of\nplaces and even increase the numbers in\nscience and engineering, for at the end of this\ndecade the falling birthrate will provide an\nideal opportunity to lower entrance\nrequirements and increase the proportion of\neach generation able to benefit from higher\neducation. The limited access available at\npresent is an insane waste of human abilities,\nwhilst the cutbacks on facilities built up so\npainstakingly over the last two decades is\nfoolish, short-sighted and only increases the\nprivilege and elitism in our society.\nSir Keith Joseph, by advocating that\nparents whose collective earnings are over\n\u00a312,000 should contribute to their children's tuition fees is violating the principle of 'free\neducation for all! At present those pupils who\nchose to leave education at sixteen and who\nare unable to find employment can claim\nunemployment benefit or social security\nindependently of their parents' income.\nThose of us (and that includes every British\nstudent at IC) who chose to continue our\neducation to the age of eighteen do so\nthrough our parent's good will and\nhospitality. But how far will this hospitality or\nthe finances of our parents stretch? There is\nno reason why parents/guardians should\nsupport any child over the age of eighteen\nwhen that person is classed as having\nreached the age of majority and is recognised\nas an adult by society at large. This problem\nis not just one of parents' duty though, if one\nconsiders the many inactive students who\nwill now have to pay for their maintenance or\nfees whilst their net income is zero. One can\nfor see a tremendous saving for the\nGovernment at a vast expense for the\nindividual who no longer has the right for free\neducation. This right has not always been\nthere though. It was only in 1977 when\nShirley Williams, then Minister of Education\nfor the Labour Party, abolished the necessity\nfor the payment of tuition fees by parents.\nThe present system has worked successfully\nfor the past seven years and even though cutbacks have taken place the country is\nproducing thousands of graduates who\ncontrol the future of the country. By altering\nthe education system the Government will\nsuddenly have several million pounds to 'play\nwith' and, no doubt, will congratulate\nthemselves on their mass saving.\nThis means saving by the Government on\neducation will be done at your expense, your\nbrothers' and sisters' expense and that of\nyour parents. Although most students to\nwhom this applies will not agree with the\nproposals, many will let apathy rule, enabling\nthe present proposals to become an act. This\nis why we are urging you to write to your local\nMP, to get your parents to write to their MP and to support the motion concerning the\nabove which is being raised at the U GM on\nthe 4 December. It is after all directly\naffecting you and if passed it will be\nimplemented as soon as next October.\nFurthermore these changes are only the thin\nend of the wedge. Having found that\nParliament will not accept a formal loans\nscheme, Sir Keith is trying to introduce loans\nby underhand means. Due to the increasing\nhardship suffered by parents and students,\nhe supposes, students will be forced to go to\nbanks and mortgage their future for a loan.\nParents who have been paying considerable\ntaxes for 20 years will now find they have to\npay tuition as well, as if higher education\nwere comparable with a private school.\nEducation may no longer be free in this\ncountry. Unless we act now, the student of\nthe future will look back on 1984 as the\ndisastrous year in which the principle of free\neducation began to be reversed. Once we\nallow it to start, who knows where it will end?\nJCR BAR\nCarlsberg Promotion\n50 p per pint\n(lunchtimes)\n3rd to 7th December\nFriday 30 November 1984 FELIX\n\n"

    "content": "OPINIONS\nThe Bible, the Qur'an,\nScience and Pork Chops\nby T Sheriff\nWhat is the connection between religious\nscripture, scientific fact and your next pork\nchop or ham sandwich?\nFor fourteen centuries believing Muslims\nhave refrained from touching pork in\nobedience to God's prohibition against it in\nthe Last Revelation, The Qur'an. The\nprohibition against eating or even touching\nthe swine has stood for almost 20 centuries in\nthe Bible, but the majority of its followers,\n'the christians', have ignored it.\nAnalysing the Biblical injunctions\nforbidding men from touching swine (Lev 11\nv78, Is 65 v4 and Is 66 v17) and the\nQur'anic (Ch 2 v173;5v3;16v114 and 6 v145) one can see that the reason for the\nprohibition lies in the fact that the flesh of the\nswine is an abomination and unclean, and\nthat the prohibition applies to the whole of\nthe animal, including its flesh, fat and bones.\nAlthough at the time of the revelation of\nthese scriptures and subsequently, there\nwas no identifiable reason for the prohibition\nother than that the injunction was from the\nAll knowing and All Wise Creator of the\nUniverse \u2014 and that was and is sufficient for\nMuslims. Recently, science, the new'god'of\nthe West has come up with concrete\nevidence to show that there are sound\nbiochemical and medical reasons for not\neating pork.\nBIOCHEMICAL AND MEDICAL\nWhen consumed by humans, animal fats\nare generally broken down into triglyceride\n(TG) molecules, which are then further\nhydro lys ed by pancreatic lipase to yield\nglycerol and free fatty acids:\nThe three groups (R1\nR2\nand R3\n) can be\neither saturated (S) or unsaturated (U). Hydrolysis by pancreatic lipase is easy if R2\nis\n(U) but difficult if R2\nis (S). There are eight\nways of arranging R1\n, R2\nand R3\nin the TG molecule; four have R2\n(S) and the other four\nR2\n(U). Experiments1\n'2\nhave shown that the fat of\nanimals described as lawful for food in\nRevelation eg sheep, cow, poultry, deer etc\nhave predominantly R2\n(U) whereas pig has\nR2\n(S) \u2014 a characteristic it shares with\ncarniv ero us animals like the cat, dog, rat!\nThe consequence of the inability of\npancreatic lipase to break down R2\n(S)inT G fat molecules is that it is absorbed as it is,\nnarrowing bloodvessel s when it gets into the\nblood steam \u2014 with the consequent risk of\nCoronary Thrombosis and Arteriosclerosis1\n\u2014 the major killer disease of the West.3\nThus, bio chemically the pig is inedible, like\nthe cat, dog and rat!\nThe medical dangers in consuming pig\nmeat are perhaps not so insidious as the\nbiochemical ones cited above, but are\nnonetheless alarming. The parasite, Taniasoleum (a species of the round worm\nTrichina which is unique to the pig) causes\nTrichinosis in the human being if infected\npork is consumed. This disease has by no\nmeans been overcome advice to consumers\nto cook their meat properly or by attempts to\nensure that pig farmers feed their pigs |\n'sterilized' garbage only.4\nThe fact is that the\nHtC-oc4,'0H VO HH0 LC \u00a3\n(\nHc \u2014 OH+ H0L C/ \u00a3\n1\nHv C \u2014oH edible inedible\n- R'uR' S \u2014R\"uR\" S R'\"u \u2014R'\"U \u2014R'uR' S \u2014R\"uR\" S \u2014K\"s R\"U \u2014R's R'UR\" uR\"S \u2014R'\"uR\" S \u2014R's R'UR\" uR\"S \u2014 Ers R'\"U dirty pig is as cav anger which eats filth, muck\nand rotting meat \u2014 converting this rubbish\ninto flesh, within three hours because of its\npoor digestive system. It is no wonder that in\nAmerica for example, one in six people are\ninfected by Trichinosis, with 350,0004\nnew\ncases reported annually, and in Germany the\nsituation is said to be even worse.\nInterestingly enough, tri cino s is as a human\ninfection is much less in the Tropics and the\nOrient!\nCONCLUSION For Muslims, this scientific evidence is\nwelcome because in highlighting some of the\nempirical facts about the nature of pigs, it\nstrengthens and confirms the faith in God.\nThe three main reasons why the 'Christians'\nhave ignored the order in the Bible to refrain\nfrom eating pork are 1) the belief that the\ncoming of the Gospel cleansed all things; 2)\nSt Peter's 'vision' of a menagerie in which he\nclaims God asked him to slaughter for food\nwhich ever animal he wished \u2014 the pig was\namong the animals he saw and 3) The\nhistoria l fact that the Patriarch of\nConstantinople at the time of Constantine\nsaid that it is not what goes into the mouth\nwhich is unclean, but what comes out. The\nrefutation of this first reason has come from a Christian, Reverend C Leonard Vorse, who\nin his book5 said that it is 'marvellous' that the\nGospel could have changed the na tue of the\npig when there is 'no evidence' that people\nhave allowed it to change their own lives.\nWith reasons 2) and 3), 'Christians' have\npermitted the dream of one man and the\npresumption of another to overrule a clear\ndecree from God which was reiterated and\nre confirmed by the Qur'an, The Last\nRevelation and by Jesus (on whom be peace)\nby implication because he said 'I come not\nbut to confirm the Law of 'Moses' (Matthew).\nSo, would you stick your fork in pork when\nit has been prohibited so clearly and\nconsist ant ly by God, and it has been shown\nby science to be literally 'inedible' and\nunclean?\nREF:\n1\nDr A Sakr: ' PORK \u2014 POSSIBLE REASONS FOR ITS PROHIBITION'.\n2\nDesnuelle et al: BIOCHEMICA ET\nBIOPHYSICA ACT A,24,1957.3' CHOLESTEROL \u2014 AND NOW THE BAD NEWS', 'TIME' magazine 25/3/84.\n4\nDJ SMITH ET AL, 'MICROBIOLOGY',\n14th ed.

It is\ntempting to re-classify them\ninto 'overtly religious' and\n'covertly religious'. As an\nexample of the first type, let's look at 'The Power and the\nGlory'. It is about a priest\ntrying to avoid persecution in\nMexico in the 'Thirties.

At one point he is\nreduced to stealing a starving\ndog's bone HEAVILY\nSYMBOLIC!( Over the last\nforty years, however, Greene's writing has been\npurged of sledgehammer metaphor.) Eventually, the\nPriest's inevitable martyrdom\ndoes provide an inspiration to\na child, to whom the old\nstories of Saints become more real. The book contains all\nGreene's favourite themes \u2014\nFaith, Hope and Love, and\nwhy do people look for God( or why do they not) \u2014 all set\nout for all readers to pick up.\nAs for style, he is in select\ncompany. Some writers seem\nto mistake long sentences for\ndeep thought, or self obsessed monologues for\ninsight. Greene avoids both\ntraps. Like Hemmingway his\nprose is so simple that his\nbooks can be read in the same\nway as pulp fiction.\nThe Quiet American\nOne of the covertly religious\nones is 'The Quiet American'\nwhich is set is Vietnam in the\ndays when the French, rather\nthan the Americans, were\ngetting the shi train. The\nweakness of the book is that\nGreene has chosen a journalist as his main character. It could be argued-that only a journalist is\nallowed a detached view of a war zone, but I am not the first\nto point out that the artist-as-hero bit occurs too often in\ntoo many media. It can only\neither be vanity or failure of\nimagination. For the rest, the\nbook is clever. Greene has\nobviously realised that one\nwriter's audience can only\ntake so much pious sentiment, and has avoided the problem\nvery neatly. His central\ncharacter is an atheist, which\nallows him to smoke opium\nand screw around. Cunning,\nhuh? Smoke opium and screw\naround\nTwo stories are\nintertwined: the tragedy of the\nidealistic Quiet American,\nwhose innocence allows\nterrible destruction; and the\nequally tragic tale of the\njournalist's loneliness. Although he 'defeats' the\nAmerican, we know that the\ngirl P huon g would have\nmarried the American if he\nwere still alive. The victory is\nincomplete. The religious bit\noccurs through the desolation\nof the journalist's soul. For\nthose that miss the signs,\nGreene keeps feeding him\nlines like:\n'I have read of people's thoughts in the moment of\nfear: of God....I admire their\ncontrol'.\nThe book ends with the\njournalist wishing that 'there\nexisted someone to whom I could say I was sorry'. And if\nthat doesn't get the message\nacross, nothing will.\nPerhaps I overstate. It is just\nabout possible to read his\nbooks from a Humanist\nviewpoint, showing the difficulties but supreme freedom of breaking loose\nfrom religion, but as Greene\nwas converted to Catholicism\nit is safe to say that this is not\nthe way they were intended.\nThe Human Factor\nIf your idea of highbrow is\nreading Le Carre in tea d of Ian\nFleming, have a look at 'The\nHuman Factor', one of\nGreene's more recent works.\nSuperficially, it reads like\n'Tinker, Tailor Soldier, Spy',\nbut on closer inspection you\nwill find two big differences.\nGreene has something to say,\nand the characters he uses to\nsay it really do have some\nsolidity \u2014 very real.\nThe story is of a man who\nescaped from South Africa\nwith his wife. The man was\nwhite, the woman black, and\nBOSS didn't approve. He\nescaped with the help of his\nfriend, who was a communist.\nAs an act of gratitude, he\nagreed to pass secrets to\nRussia. Thus the story is, at\nheart, one about conflicting\nloyalties rather than some\n' chess game' intelligence coup.\nIn short: cooler than George\nSmiley, more religious than\nAlbert Einstein, what more\ncould you ask?\n'Not out chasing women\nthis weekend'?\n'Course not old chap, the\nnew celibacy. God, you're\npass e'.( Penguin publish lots and\nlots of Graham Greene's books in paperback).\nFELIX\nFriday 30 November 1984\n\n"

As the weeks passed\nless people attended.\nThe end result is only six\nplayers for the U AU SE Regional\nTournament in Brighton last\nweekend!\nIt's your fault if you had come\nto training you could have come.\nSo in brief, here is the report:\nFriday evening six players plus\ninjured coach. Two hours\nsearch, extra player.\nSaturday morning frost bite on\nBrighton beach. Venue \u2014 eight\nteams, two pools of four..Ours \u2014\narch rivals Brunei and East\nAnglia last years U AU semifinalists.\nVs East Anglia. Uncle Nick\nNitchell hits from scoring 27\npoints. This, strong defence and\nteam work yield an unbelievable\n61-66 victory.\nVs Brunei. Team spirit and\nhard defence by all kept us about\nlevel till five Brunei players had\nfouled out allowing us to snatch a fabulous 60-64 win!\nSunday all we have to do is\nbeat Sussex to go through. We\nshoot the light out, swat their\nshots and generally make\nhamburger out of them in losing\nby four points.\nThree way tie for first in our\npool. Points differ n ce puts us\nsecond in into a tournament\nthird/fourth play off vs LSE\nThe first half saw general\ndisarray and we were well down\n41-25 at juice time.\nThen we get into foul trouble\nand play the last five minutes\nwith four players. We were not\ndisgraced, however, actually\nout scoring LSE in the second\nhalf in losing 87-75.\n10-PIN BOWLING\nNo competition\nTo begin with, the A team,\nwere beating their counterparts,\nbut since mega star Chris\nWheeldon didn't get a perfect\nscore, they lost. The B team\ncame closest to getting any result\nand the C team....well, their best\nplayer was nearly bowler number\nfive (there wasn't one!). Also, the\nladies' team lost. We didn't have\nany of them, either!\nFinal Result \u2014 Southampton\n10 IC 0\nSo don't forget, if you want to\njoin a club that is easy going,\ndoesn't cost the earth to Bowl, is\nreasonably friendly, then bowling\nis the sport for you. Any girls are\nguaranteed a place in the Ladies'\nteam, so be at Chem Eng Foyer,\n2.30pm Wednesday.\nLADIES RUGBY\nResounding\nThe first match two weeks into\nterm served to initiate the new\nmembers into the game. A good\nfirst game, Finchley being a well-drilled experienced team.\nNext the team travelled\naway to Warwick, having\npractised hard since the shock\nand inevitable pain of the first\nmatch, and experienced a resounding 20-0 win with the\ncelebrations to follow.\nWith a win under their belts\nthey next met Charing Cross\nand yes, won again 19-0. Away\nagain back up the bloody Ml to\nmeet Leicester Poly to lose only\n4-0. Hindered by a sparse turnout of eleven players but a good\nmatch all the same (should have\nwon that one girls!)\nUCL gave their usual friendly\nmatch beating IC 8-0 both tries\nbeing scored in the first few\nminutes and serving to wake the\nteam up having little get up and\ngo after the Guilds Carnival the\nprevious-night. From then on the\nopposition was courageously\nfended off.\nORIENTEERING\nChurchill\nwarm-up\nWith the Southern Championships next weekend, the o club\nsharpened up their skills at a club\nevent on South Ashdown.\nOn this large open area\nconditions favoured fast\nrunners, though map-reading\nerrors cost dearly. Eppington\nloped around to finish within\nminutes of the winner; while\nFoster is 'Wally of the Week' for\ncopying down his course in\n'deli ble' ink, and having to call on\npsychic powers to find the last\nfew controls.\nIn two weeks we'll annihilate\nOxford and Kent in the Churchill\nCup, so we'll need all oriente ers to be there.\nBADMINTON\nNightmare\nLadies U AU Playoff'21/11/84\nIC Ladies vs Brunei Ladies\nWe arrived safely, despite the\nhideous experience (which we\njust managed to survive) of\nsharing a coach with the Rugby\nTeam.\nIC first pair vs Brunels first pair\nDespite the 'leaden shuttles',\nour first pair gave us a good start\nby winning 15-5, 15-8. Obviously\nour superbly skilled pair were too\nmuch for Brunei's feeble attempt\nat an opposition!\nIC second pair vs Brunei second\npair\nNot only did the second pair\nhave to adapt to 'bionic shuttles'\n( possibly even nuclear powered?), but this was their first\nmatch as partners, and naturally\nthey took a little while to get their\ntactics together, resulting in us\nlosing the first game 15-0.\nUnfortunately for us, their\ntactics were still a little uncertain\nin the second game; they put up a good fight, but managed to lose\n15-8.\nIC third pair vs Brunei third pair\nAs expected our third pair\ndidn't quite manage to beat\nBrunei's third pair, but put up a brave show to close 15-9, 15-8.\nNB: It was at this point that the\nthought that we might not\nactually win began to impose\nitself upon us.\nIC first pair vs Brunei second\npair\nNo comment, but immense\nembarrassment for our first pair\nas they lost to Brunei's second\npair in three games: 15-13, 11-15,\n6-15. Shame on them.\nIC second pair vs Brunei third\npair\nAfter a disappointing first\ngame which our pair lost 10-15, a great come back started\nmaterial ising as our second pair\nwon the second game 15-8.\nHowever, due to a slight drop in\nour pairs' badminton standard,\nwe lost the third game 10-15; this\nbeing yet reversed.\nIC third pair vs Brunei first pair\nRather an appr opiate quote\nfor game which was lost 8-15, 0-15.\nNb: at this point the match was\nlost!\nIC first pair vs Brunei third pair\nAnother successful annihilation of Brunei by our first pair\n(and I should bloody well think\nso!). The quote 'Alas poor\nBrunei, I them well, IC( Hamlet\ned) could well describe the\nopposition at the end of their\nslight beating by our first pair: 15-5,15-5.\nVOLLEYBALL\nInitial Success\nU AU Championship\nThe newly formed IC Ladies'\nVolleyball team made an\nexcellent start in establishing\nitself as a respectable University\nteam on a national level on\nSunday. The event was the U AU championships for the south\nEast and the venue was the\nsports' centre at Essex University.\nWe had to start playing our\nfirst match immediately, against\nBrunei University. Some lovely\nserving and consistent team\nwork won us the first set 15-5.\nThe second set contained more\nexcitement, since the opposition\ndecided to put up a fight, but\ndespite all their efforts, we\nmanaged to beat them 18-16, and\nthus won our first match. This\nresult helped us build up\nconfidence, which in turn\nproduced good results in the first\nset against a very good team\nrepresenting Kent University. In\nthis set, we managed to get nine\npoints off the opposition. The\nsecond set, however, was quite\ndisappointing in terms of results,\nsince the experience and\nindividual expertise of the Kent\ngirls, meant that we were unable\nto launch successful attacks, and\nthus match to the eventual\nwinner of the tournament 2-0.\nWe had, however, accumulated enough points in the first\nround to reach the semi-finals,\nwhere we played against the\nUniversity of East Anglia.\nThe first set was very closely\nfought for, but the lack of\nexperience on our part, led to us\nlosing confidence at the crucial\nmoment, and we lost it by only\ntwo points. The second set also\nwent to the UEA, at 15-8.\nDespite the fact that we did\nnot get through to the final, as we\nhad hoped, our girls' dedication\nand hard-work means that great\namounts bf improvement and\nachievement are on the way.\n14 Friday 30 November 1984 FELIX\n\n"

After Phil Woolas,\nNUS president, arrived the\ncrowd started to cross Westminister Bridge in small\ngroups, to take 28,000 letters of\nprotest to 10 Downing Street and\nto lobby MPs at Westminister.\nSeveral hundred demonstrators\ntried to break through the crowd\ncontrol barriers. This led the\npolice to close the bridge entirely,\ncutting off the students who had\ncrossed the bridge from the main\nbody. This smaller group then\nsplit, some lobbying MPs, some\nled by Ian Bull and Dave Parry\nmarching to Whitehall.\nOn the South bank of the\nThames the main body split, and\ntried to cross the river by other\nroutes. As the demonstration\ncrossed the other bridges they\nblocked them, and at one stage\nWestminster, Lambeth and\nWaterloo Bridges were blocked,\nthrowing Central London into\nchaos during the afternoon rush\nhour. This was worsened when a few hundred students tried to\nblock Parliamant Square, but\nthis was prevented by effective\npolice action.\nOn the South side of\nWestminister Bridge about 1000\nstudents were faced by 20\nmounted police and 200\nthem held flares to provide light.\nThey were addressed by Phil\nWoolas standing on the roof of a bus shelter, and he claim d that\nthe NUS had gained a victory by\ncausing such chaos.

At one stage some\nstudents from Coventry Polytechnic climbed 60 feet up\nthe side of County Hall and\nerected a banner, to the applause\nof the GLC staff inside.\nAfter consultation with the\npolice Mr Woolas asked the\ncrowd to disperse. Rumours of\nmass arrests sparked-off a sit-down by about 100 students, but\nby this time the steady stream of\npolice reinforcements meant that\nthe police were able to clear the\nbridge by sheer weight of\nnumbers, and there were no\narrests.

    "content": "RETURNING OFFICER'S REPORT,\nDEPUTY PRESIDENT'S REPORT.\n1. Posters & Events.\nThe general public are not allowed onto College/Union premises. This\nis of paramount importance as regards fire precautions, safety and our\nalcohol licences for which we( the membership of IC) are regarded as a club. Any infringement of this could lead to judicial proceeds and/or\nour licence to be revoked. Please do not put posters where they are\nvisible to the passing public; i.e. facing out onto the roads surrounding\nus.\n2. House Committee.\nThis year House Committee has decided to concentrate its attention on\nthe refurbishment of the top floor of the Union Building.\n3. Refectory Committee.\nThe Union Bar is to be painted and wood surface l polished over the\nChristmas vacation. It will therefore be closed from Saturday 15th December - Friday 4th January. Other major refurbishment schemes for\nthe bars are under active consideration.\n4. Games Machines.\nWe are putting another video into the games room soon - either 'Defender*\nor 'Hyper-sports'. A Juke-box may well be installed in the lounge if\nnegotiations proceed well.\n5. Rape Alarms.\nThey are still available from me.\n6. Safety/Accidents/Defects.\nIam the Union Safety Officer. If you have an accident in the building\nor notice a defect or dangerous occur en ce please come and see me before\nsomeone gets hurt.\n\u20227, Conference Office Equipment.\nGill Davies, the Conference Officer, and myself, after lengthy discussion\nabout the use of Conference Office equipment by clubs and societies\ndecided that it would be only fair to make a nominal charge for the use of\ntheir tables at \u00a31 each. We also agreed to ask for a personnel cheque of\n\u00a310 as a deposit against the equipment hired.\nFor the use of screens etc.. there will be no charge but a letter from me confirming ICU's responsibility for the stuff is needed.\n1. Ratifications.\nThe following vacancies have been filled since the last U GM and I ask\nthe meeting to ratify them.\nOrdinary Member of ICCAG - Kevin Yapp\nGU C Delegate - Dave Kingston\nINCOST organising Committee - Dave Rowe.\n2. Aero Dep. Rep.\nIt seems to me that nobody in this department wants a representative.\nThe last time I looked there was one candidate who had two second ers and now someone has removed the election paper. I shall be putting up\na new paper on the Wednesday morning after the meeting, December 5th.I don't care if you have a Dep. Rep. or not,but I would hope that some\nof you do.\n3. Vacancies.\nThe following vacancies still exist;-One Ordinary Member of ICCAG.\nHandbook Editor.\nSecretary to Academic Affairs Committee.\nNominations will be taken from the floor if none are received before\nthe meeting.\nMOTION ON STUDENT GRANTS AND FEES.\nProposed by: Mike Young, Chairman,\nIC SDP Society.\nSeconded by; Abigail Levin, Elec.Eng.2.\nICU Notes:\n1. The recent proposals by the Secretary of State for Education and Science\nto significantly raise the rate of parental contribution to student\nmaintenance grants.\n2. The proposed introduction of part or full payment of tuition fees by\nparents if their collective disposable income exceeds about \u00a313,000.\n3. The increasing financial problems of students in London, made worse by\nthe lack of suitably priced accommodation and the recent changes in the\nstudent travel allowance.\n4. 4\n7\n% of students do not receive their full parental contribution.\n5. The principle enshrined in the Education Act of 1944 that higher education\nin Britain should be free at the time it is required.\n6. Demonstrations against the proposed changes are being organised by students\nacross the country, but as yet IC Union has made no significant response.\nHONORARY SECRETARY'S REPORT.\n1. HallVs|Insurance.\nSince the last U GM there has been a noticeable, although not staggering,\nincrease in feedback from people making insurance claims. I could still\ndo with more information although Iam now satisfied that the new policy\nis effective.\n2. INCOST.\nI have been extremely diss a pointed by the complete lack of interest being\nshown in this conference, especially those members of last year's Council\nwho were so enthusiastic that we should hold it. The attempt to set up\na formal organising committee was a dismal failure so it will have to be\ndone on a much more informal basis. If there is anybody who is interested\nIn helping in any way could they please come and see me in the Union\nOffice, there are a great variety of things which need to be done and you\ndon't need to know anything about Biotechnology, I don't.3. Transport.\nThe organisational side of booking external vans as well as our own has\nimproved since the beginning of term although there is the inevitable\noccasional cock-up.\nThe major problem is in the parking department - people persist ant ly park in our so aces. We have recently (two days ago at the time of writing)\nintroduced a boll ard system which should keep people out but it is too\nearly to comment on the success of this venture.\n4. Parking.\nThe problem Is basically that an awful lot of people without permits\nmanage to sweet-talk their way past the guy on the barrier and\nconsequently there is insufficient room for those people with permits.\nIf someone is in your space tell the barrier attendant before you park in\nsomeone else's. If it is a case of one person persist ant ly using the wrong\nspace come and see me and I will do what I can. There are NO parking\npermits left.\nICU Believes:\n1. Education should be free in Britain, because it is a national Investment\nin the future and should be independent as far as possible from a student's background.\n2. A large and increasing number of graduates are essential to the future\npos per it y and culture of Britain.\n3. The proposed measures will cause students to rely too heavily on their\nparents' financial support and will lead to increasing financial problems\namongst parents and students, discouraging and even preventing suitably\nqualified British people from furthering their education.\n4. The proposed dna gers are only the thin end of the wedge. Once the principle\nof free education has been isolated and an environment of increasing\nfinancial hardship created, the payment of fees could be extended to all\nparents and loans schemes introduced. This underhand means could lead to\nthe establishment of a private school mentality in universities.\nICU Instructs:\n1. ICU President to inform the Secretary of State for Education and Science,\nand Peter Brooke MP of the views of IC Union on this subject, and publish\nthe text of his letter in Felix.\n2. ICU President to report back to the next U GM on the outcome of his action.\n3. ICU President to write to the Education Spokesperson of the Labour, SDP\nand Liberal parties urging them to oppose the proposed changes and support\nthe beliefs of IC Union.\n4. ICU delegation to ULU GU C to put forward this motion at the earliest\npossible opportunity.\nICU Requests:\nAll its members to write to their local M.P. and join in demonstrations protesting\nabout the proposed cuts.\nMOTION ON FREEDOM OF CHOICE.\nProposed by: Tim Williams.\nSeconded by: Eric Derbyshire.\nICU Notes:\n1. The motion on 'Freedom of Choice' passed at aUG M on December 6th1983.2. The reference to IC Union rooms in ICU Instructs 1. of that motion.\nICU Believes:\nThat this is unclear.\nICU Instructs:\nThat the word 'rooms' be replaced with the word 'facilities' such that\nthe final phrase now reads 'and that CCU's may use IC Union facilities\nfor any event*.\n\n"

In no\ntime at all we were all huddled together\nin the minibus amid the swilling soup,\npaper cups and loaves of bread shaking\nabout on the floor.\nOur first port of call was Lincoln's Inn\nFields. It felt a bit eerie as we drove into\na pitch-black park, devoid of any sign of\nlife. But suddenly I noticed movement\nfrom behind the bandstand and\ngradually, one by one, men started to\nappear from nowhere. As we got all the\nfood and drink out they queued up in an\norderly manner to get their ration of\nsustenance to help them last the night.\nThey were all so grateful and polite that\nI was quite taken aback. Down and out,\ndestitute, tramps; call them what you\nwill, they're just as human as you or me.\nThey seemed to long for people to talk .\nto, people to listen to, people to listen to\ntheir problems, people who would treat\nthem with some respect rather than as\nsecond-class citizens; people to offer\nthem a little love.\nWhen all the food was gone we drove\noff to Embankment Station where\npeople were huddled under blankets,\nsleeping bags, even cardboard boxes,\nagainst a cold, corrugated-iron frame. I spoke to one young lad in his twenties\nwho hadn't eaten for three days. His\nface was pale and thin, he looked\ndesperate. They all looked so pathetic in\none way, but such a strong little\ncommunity in another. It was so\ndifferent from what I had expected. I'm sure that the night left me with a unique\nexperience which I shall never forget.O \u2022The soup run leaves Weeks Hall each\nThursday evening at 9.15pm, re turing home\nby midnight.

The variety in the jobs\navailable reflects the needs of the\npeople who, for whatever reason,\nrequire the assistance of others. As well\nas practical help, the company of\nstudents is always appreciated,\nespecially by those who have little\ncontact with the outside world.\nThe variety of jobs is immense; sitting-in with an elderly, housebound woman\nso her husband can get a chance to go\nout; painting the ceiling and walls of a staircase for a single mother who would\nnot have been able to manage alone;\nfitting draught exclude rs on doors and\nwindows; helping an elderly man taking\nhis first bath; fitting a new carpet for a man who had just moved into new\naccommodation. Most of these involve\nabout three people each a week.\nJobbersquad does not require a weekly commit t ment from those\ninvolved.
