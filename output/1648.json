(That sentence was too long but fuck it)\nThe plan was to write some inspirational stuff\nabout protesting, about how action is the only\nanswer. I was going to rant about the plague\nof complacency and apathy that seems to\ncharacterise our world today. I was going to\nencourage you to think, to talk, to discuss, to\ncomplain to verbally battle shit out (emphasis on\nverbally). I was going to make a point that you\nneed to fight for change, that you can\u2019t just wait\nfor it to happen \u2018cause one day you\u2019ll wake up\nand realise that the world has indeed changed\nbut has left you behind and has probably banned\nsomething stupid like nipple clamps along the\nway too.\nBut so much shit keeps going down. They came\nfor our education (It\u2019s not even particularly\ngood, even VP Education admits to it) , they came\nfor our drugs (poppers only narrowly escaped)\nand now they\u2019re coming for our porn? I mean\ncome on! So yes, I\u2019m tired and I just can\u2019t look\nyou in the eye and lie to you. I can\u2019t even be\nbothered to type-lie to you.\nSo here\u2019s the truth. Protesting is hard. It\u2019s not\na one off. It\u2019s a way of life. To protest means to\nlive life unapologetically. To refuse to be bossed\naround. To think freely. To be a protester means\nspending your entire life, your entire existence\npushing, for yourself and for others.\nThis life will eat you up and spit you out. You\nwill be drained and you will feel dead inside. But\nit\u2019s ok. There\u2019s nothing like a short break away\nfrom the daily grind to pump you up again and\nmake you ready to start pushing again.\nT H E\nT E A M\nAddress | felix, Beit Quad, Prince Consort Road, London, SW7 2BB || Telephone | 02075948072 || Printed by | Ilifee Print\nCambridge, Winship Road, Cambridge || Registered Newspaper | ISSN 1040-0711 || Copyright \u00a9 felix 2016\nEditor-in-Chief | Lef Apostolakis || Deputy Editor | Mattin Mir-Tahmasebi || News Editor | Matt Johnston || Comment Editors |\nVivien Hadlow, Tessa Davey, Jonathan Masters || Culture Ringmaster | Fred Fyles || Culture Editors | Indira Mallik, Ben Williams,\nSimran Kukran, Tom Stephens, Meryl Anil, Anurag Deshpande, Theo Farah || Puzzles Editor | Hamish Beck || Clubs & Societies\nEditor | Abigail de Bruin || Science Editor | Lizzie Riach || Millennials Queen | Tessa Davey || Millennials Editors | Saad Ahmed,\nSanjay Battacharaya, Matt Johnston || Sports Editor | Sam Smith || Illustrator | Nathan Macabuag || Copy Chief | Mattin MirTahmasebi || Copy Editors | Selin Olenik, Aishwarya Pattar, Alex Adler || Cover | Harisson Jones || Centrefold | Fahdi Kanavati\n\n"

Not women\nknowing their place,\nor the coloureds not\nbeing able to to talk\nback to a fine respecting member\nof civilised society such as myself,\nbut the fact you just can\u2019t crush\na liberal protest like you used to\nbe able to. You know what was a\ngood protest? Kent state in 1970.\nIt goes without saying that things\ngot out of hand, but you can\u2019t\ndeny that those long-hairs learnt\na good lesson about respecting\nauthority and respecting guns.\nWhere we lost our way was\nbeing too worried about how the\nmedia perceives being strong and\ndecisive as opposed to being a\nwalkover liberal.\nYet again this week we had\nstudents crying about the fact\nthat they are having their university paid for and that they\nhave access to higher educa-tion, as well the state giving\nthem money to spend on booze\nand dib-dabs. How about you\nget a job you lazy hippies?\nThe only reason there\u2019s youth\nunemployment is because these\nlosers with their degrees in\ncommunications and art history\nare too worried about creating\nsafe spaces and not triggering\nother people in order get some\nlife experience. \u2018Oh i just want\nto travel and enjoy life\u2019 GET A\nFUCKING JOB \u2018I\u2019m not really\nsure what I want to do just yet\u2019\nGET A FUCKING JOB \u2018 I have\nstage four leukaemia\u2019 STOP\nGIVING ME EXCUSES YOU\nPUSSY AND GET A JOB.\nOf course if someone on the\nright wing starts to protest\nabout something, then we\u2019re\nracist and bigoted, but as soon\nas a couple of junior doctors\nmight have to work for the first\ntime in six years, it\u2019s no holds\nbarred, right?! When I protested\nthe election of Barack HUSSEIN Obama I was labelled a\ncrybaby, but through my manly,\npatriotic tears, I continued railing against his attempt to censor\nfree speech and make being\nwhite illegal to the present day.\nNowadays, however, these\nsore losers hold their shitty\nsigns against a democratically\nelected man who has done\nnothing more than grab a few\npussies. Furthermore, you would\nthink with millions of art graduates crying, they could have\nmade better signs. Maybe a\nfew more colours. Maybe a bit\nmore white. Not racist.\nT\nhis week I finally did\nwhat my tumblr has\nbeen promising for ages:\nI changed society for\nthe better and, perhaps,\nreversed a politician\u2019s\nmind all by myself! I held up a\npiece of A3 paper that I liberated\nfrom the library printer, and\nscrawled a piece of pure poetry in\nsharpie: \u201cFuck tory cunts\u201d. In that\nsingle moment I think I may have\nsolved austerity, found an extra\ntwo billion pounds for the NHS,\nand may have finally assured the\nelection for our lord and saviour\nJeremy Corbyn.\nI think the problem that many\npeople in the labour party\ndon\u2019t understand is that what\nmillionaire Eton-educated\nconservatives need in order to\nsee the error of their ways is\na twenty-something millennial\nwith dreadlocks shouting in the\nmiddle of street on a saturday whilst they\u2019re all in their\nmansions in Devon, recovering\nfrom a long hard week of doing\nnothing.\nAt one point in the protest it\nseemed like we needed both\nphysical and spiritual nour-ishment, so luckily my friend\nMillicent Montagu-Douglas-Scott had brought his guitar\n( he is like the best doula I have\never met and I have been to\nboomtown festival). He knows\nabout three chords, but the passion with which he plays them\njust defies any rules of musicality of rhythm and he just made\nprotesting even more spiritual\nand pure. On the physical front,\nI\u2019d luckily baked soya-lentil-ve-gan concoction and in no time\nwe were ready to get back\nto shouting at the millions of\npeople ignoring us and tutting\nfor blocking the way to Buckingham Palace.\nWhat is disgusting, however,\nis when people who disagree\nwith my views are allowed to\nprotest. It goes against every\ndemocratic right in the western\nworld to allow a protest about\nabortion or gay marriage and\nit makes me sick. These people\njust shouldn\u2019t be allowed to\nprotest. They don\u2019t know how to\nprotest\u2013 it should be about love,\nunity, and gluten-free snacks,\nnot about something that has\nbeen democratically made\nlaw by representatives and\nsomething that is approved by\nthe majority of the country. That\nwould be like protesting a politician that was fairly elected into\noffice just because you don\u2019t like\nthe person. Oh wait...\nIf you\u2019re not gluten-free you can\u2019t protest\nwith me\nJonathan Masters gets angry at\nthe cultural appropriation of protest culture by the alt-right\nYour signs are a\ndisgrace. Go back\nto art school\nMonathan Jasters reminisces\nthe good old days when protests\nwere not so PG13\nS\nV\n* Sponsored by\nTilaTequila\nCANCER\nVIRGO\nThis week you do\nreally badly on a piece\nof coursework. Don\u2019t\nworry though, there are\nmany more coming up.\nPlenty. More.\nLEO\nPISCES\nAQUARIUS\nSAGITTARIUS\nSCORPIO\nLIBRA\nGEMINI\nTAURUS\nARIES\nThis week you\norder a vegetarian\nburrito. Surprise\nmotherfuckers it\u2019s just\na veggie burger in a\npretty dress.\nThis week you spend\nall your evenings in the\nLibrary and so can\u2019t\nconsult the stars to see\nif Mercury has indeed\naligned with Queen\u2019s\nTower. This explains the\nlack of astrology this week.\nSoz.\nThis week you\u2019re the\nnew Dolly the sheep\nstatue in Central\nLibrary. You end up\nspending less time\nin there than some\nstudents do.\nThis week you heed felix\u2019s\nadvice and finally try\nmasturbation. You like it so\nmuch you decide to form a\nnew society just for wankers.\nUnfortunately due to a typo\nyou end up forming a society\nfor bankers. No-one notices.\nThis week you\u2019re\nbeside yourself with\nanger that Fabric is\nreopening. We\u2019d won\nthe war on drugs!! But\nnot anymore.\nThis week you change\nyour clothes for something\nbright and fashionable as\nyou realise you have been\nwearing the same clothes\nfor all of your degree. No\none likes the new you so\nyou immediately change\nback. Don\u2019t worry tho felix\nthinks you look peng.\nThis week you get\napproached by the\nillustrious Imperial\ndrinking society, The\n2:1\u2019s. Rumour has it\nthat they\u2019re the ones\ncontrolling the Beit\nQuad Cartel\u2026\nThis week you\nremember that the\nBlack Friday sales\nhave started. Yay!\nEven more things you\ncan\u2019t afford to buy\nbut probably will buy\nregardless.\nThis week you finally\ngo into your overdraft.\nThis is great news as\nyou now aren\u2019t actually\npaying for anything, Mr\nSantander is.\nThis week you essentially\nlive in your labs. You even\nhave your own place to\nnap and stockpile of food.\nYou probably shouldn\u2019t be\nmaking tea in a distillation\ncolumn though.\nThis week you still\ncan\u2019t afford to put on\nthe heating and you\nend up like the TfL fees\nuntil 2020. Frozen.\nCAPRICORN\nCRISIS\nChris\nDear Chris,\nI have a problem. OK well I guess that\u2019s obvious since\nI\u2019m writing to you for advice, but anyway the problem is\nto do with my housemate. When we started university, he\nwas one of the most down to earth guys I know, and was\nalways very open minded to everyone and their views.\nThis year, however, there has been quite the change. He\nhas become far more right wing, starting to say that perhaps we should listen to Donald Trump, and that maybe\nwe should stop refugees into our country. I like him alot,\nbut I\u2019m not sure how to get around this obstacle of him\nhaving such awful politics.\nYours anxiously,\nHillary\nHOROSCOPES\nShiliary Shiliary Shiliary,\nI\u2019m so glad you could ask this question as I\u2019ve\nbeen getting it a lot lately. Change can be\ndifficult for everyone, especially when it is to\ndo with housemates who you have to spend a\nwhole year with. I think the key here is to be\nsupportive of your friend rather than accusing\nthem of having \u2018awful politics\u2019 just because you\ndon\u2019t agree with them or because their views\nare not based on \u2018facts\u2019. Facts are so 2012!!\nWhat even is a fact!!? They\u2019re like magnets:\nno-one knows how they work.\nGoing to the specific examples you have mentioned Shiliary, I think we should make it clear\nhere that Trump won an election that was fixed\nfor the Democrats to win. He is clearly the\nwinner that the world needs to tackle problems\nlike \u2018Climate Change\u2019 or \u2018Aleppo\u2019 (whatever\nthat is). As for the refugee crisis do we really\nwant more \u2018ethnic\u2019 people coming over here?\nFor me this is like putting salt and pepper into\nthe same shaker, like who would do that!?! So\nif you wouldn\u2019t mix salt and pepper why would\nyou invite others to come into our country? It\u2019s\njust common sense!\nAnyway, just remember my long standing\nadvice, if someone challenges your views just\nbuckle and start agreeing with them. Which\nalso happens to be the secret to long lasting\nfriendships.\nBig luv,\nChris xxxxx\n\n"

G.L.O.S.S (Girls Living Outside\nSociety\u2019s Shit) used their sole release to rail against the sexism and\nhomophobia people face in this scene, discussing issues such as\ngender identity and sexism.\n\\\\ Sabotage Records\nAlternative Tentacles \\\\\nPunk music, and its offshoots, has always retained a continuing theme of protest against society\u2019s\nwrongs. Here are some of my favourites.\nPunk has a long standing tradition of bands taking a stance on\nanimal rights, Left For Dead\u2019s Skin Graft being a prime example.\nThis song is 45 seconds of violent attack on animal testing and\nwearing of fur, suggesting those whom endorse such acts deserve\neven worse treatment than the critters involved. The searing\nguitar and pummelling beats complete this intense experience.\nLeft For Dead \u2013 Skin Graft\nFugazi \u2013 The Argument Dead Kennedys \u2013 Holiday in Cambodia\nThe title track from Fugazi\u2019s final album is a strong departure from\ntheir raucous earlier work. It instead presents a resigned statement\non the Iraq war. Rather than fiery rhetoric, The Argument presents a\nmature view. This track is a beaten protest about how the same arguments always come up and always win. The stripped back nature of\nthis song makes it a wonderful piece of art.\nThe Clash and Dead Kennedys present a similar, highly political\noutlook, however they couldn\u2019t be further apart. Eschewing the\nintelligent, prudish style of The Clash and replacing it with a\ncrass, sarcastic voice, this track sardonically imagines how those\nwho would go on holiday in Cambodia would appreciate being\ndropped into one of Pol Pot\u2019s gulags.\nDoom \u2013 Police Bastard\nThe title of this song speaks for itself. Authority is held in such\ndisdain in punk circles that it is of no surprise that this contempt\nextends to its enforcers. The whole of the Police Bastard EP sounds\nlike it was recorded in a metal bin \u2013 with tinny d-beat drums competing with thin, dirty guitars \u2013 adding to the vitriol and rage in the\nEP\u2019s title track.\n\\\\ Discarded Records\nStartracks Records \\\\\nTheir contribution to modern music as a whole needing little\nintroduction, The Clash\u2019s use of reggae influences and keen\npolitical lyrics have shaped and inspired many. For me, this is the\nbest example of their signature style, reporting the defiance of\ncommunities in the face of racism and police brutality.\nThe Clash \u2013 The Guns Of Brixton\nRefused \u2013 Rather Be Dead\nEarth Crisis \u2013 Firestorm\nRefused have always been a political band with strong anarchist\nleanings. At least, they were until they played Coachella for\nmoney reasons. Rather Be Dead itself is an angry tirade against\nall forms of authority and a firm pledge that Refused are prepared\nto fight the power. This all takes place over tense chugging, palm\nmuted guitars\nIt would be hard to justify not including this track. Firestorm\ndescribes a drug epidemic hitting the narrator\u2019s city. Earth Crisis\nissues a call for punks to militarise with straight-edgers, taking the\nfight to those who use drugs. The views in this song are ignorant\nand inflexible, much like many 90\u2019s hardcore songs. This makes\nFirestorm a great look into a highly political, aggressive scene\nteetering on the edge of self parody.\nGarside\u2019s window-smashing soundtrack\nRob Garside\n\n"

You think you\u2019ve\nscored the jackpot and can\u2019t\ndo any better. But, you have\na nagging suspicion about\nthem: you think they might\nbe a gamer. You don\u2019t want\nto believe it, but you can\u2019t\ndeny certain features about\nthem seem a little unusual. I\u2019m\ngoing to explain certain telltale signs which would prove,\nwithout a doubt, that they are\nindeed a gamer.\n1 | Extreme\nhardware\nThey have a really massive...\nPC, which they use to play\ngames, complete with things\nyou didn\u2019t know existed, such\nas a liquid-cooling video\ncard. Honestly, they\u2019ve probably spent more time on their\nPC than they have on you. Of\ncourse, they may also have a\nconsole which sort of counts\nbut not really. (PC Master\nrace for life!)\nThey know the names of all\nthe 800+ Pok\u00e9mon, complete\nwith typings, movepool, abil-ities, z-moves, and basically\neverything there is to know. It\nmassively dwarfs your knowledge of just Pikachu and its\nsignature move, thunderbolt.\nThey will at some point proceed to tell you how, actually,\nvolt tackle is Pikachu\u2019s signature move.\nWhen the new fire emblem\ngame comes out, it\u2019s all that\nthey\u2019ll talk about. Every time\nyou have a conversation with\nthem from that point onwards,\nthey\u2019ll use all sorts of names\nand phrases you haven\u2019t even\nheard of and constantly complain about how the RNG isn\u2019t\nin their favour or something.\nAll you\u2019ll be able to do in\nthese discussions is smile and\nnod like the good SO that\nyou are.\nThey can recite all the\nupcoming release dates for a\nlarge variety of sequels and\nindie games in a heartbeat.\nNormally you wouldn\u2019t mind\nthis too much, if only they\nwould also remember when\nyour birthday actually was.\nThey get really excited at\nChristmas and Summer, but\nnot because they\u2019re excited\nto see their family again. It\u2019s\nactually because the steam\nsale takes place around this\ntime and they basically blow\ntheir entire bank account on\ngames they\u2019ll probably never\nplay in their life.\nWhenever you try to spend\nsome quality time with them,\nthey will occasionally deny\nyour request and spout some\nnonsense about how live\ngames can\u2019t be paused and\nhow the opposing team is\ninvading the barracks. Usually at that point, you\u2019d hear\na loud clicking noise from\ntheir room which they simply\nexplain as \u2018lol\u2019.\n(APM is actions per minute\nyou noob!)\nA lot of your hang out\nsessions involve the two of\nyou gaming with each other.\nOr, to be more precise, them\nbeating you at whatever\ngame you guys play with\nyou winning occasionally;\nyou know for a fact it\u2019s only\nbecause they let you win.\nIf the person you\u2019re dating\nhas even some of these\nquirks, it\u2019s time to face the\nfacts; you\u2019re dating a gamer.\nAnd honestly, there\u2019s nothing\nreally wrong with it. They\u2019re\npeople just like you and me\n(or even your lecturers). If\nthey seem to devote more of\ntheir life to games than they\ndo to you, that might mean\nthey have severe prioritisation\nissues. In this case, it would be\nwise to have a nice long talk,\nwhere they need to re-evalu-ate their life choices. Or, you\ncan just suck it up and enjoy\nthe experience of repeatedly\nlosing against every single\ncharacter in Smash. Your call.\nAlmost all the gifts they\ngive you are gaming themed.\nYou\u2019re not entirely sure why\nyou would want an Assassin\u2019s\nCreed gauntlet but you\naccept it nonetheless.\n2 | Pok\u00e9mon\nguru\n3 | Non-stop\nfangirling\n4 | Recollection\nexpert\n5 | Uninspired\ngifts\n6 | Not the APM\nyou want\n7 | Steam sale\nfrenzy\n8 | Sisyphean\ngaming\nSaad Ahmed\n\n"

The show follows the\nCulper Ring, an unlikely group of farmers who banded together to help George\nWashington win the war. Be warned though, it is heavily dramatized, so if\nyou\u2019re looking for a historically accurate chronicle of the minutia of revolution,\nthis ain\u2019t it.

Joe MacMillan, a mysterious engineer who disappeared\nfrom IBM, shows up at a small scale PC company in Texas with a dangerous\nproposition for unsuspecting engineer Gordon Clark. Together with unconventional student Cameron, they set out to reverse engineer an IBM PC and\nrevolutionize the home computing game.\nKeeping up with the theme of Computing, Mr. Robot follows modern day\ncyber-vigilante Elliot Alderson, played by the always excellent Rami Malek.\nElliot, initially a security engineer struggling with depression and anxiety,\nis recruited into the hacktivism collective known only as \u2018Mr. Robot\u2019. What\nfollows is a thrilling examination of the modern day security industry, as well\nas Alderson\u2019s own mental state.\nMr. Robot\nUnderground\nIt\u2019s unlikely that you\u2019ve heard of Underground, but if you\u2019re interested in\nhistorical fiction or an examination of slavery, this is something you need to pay\nattention to. Underground opts to present a very focused story by centering on\none group of escaped slaves rather than addressing the injustice as a whole. In\ndoing so, it manages to preserve the humanity of the tragedy and keeps a tight\npace. The show manages to present enthralling and engaging action, whilst still\nmanaging to respectfully address the subject matter.\nProtest can be tiring, so of course you need some downtime.

From films like Cowspiracy to\nthe infamous Triumph of the Will, history\nanswers the question with a resounding,\n\u2018yes\u2019.\nE\nntertainment,\nexpression, and\neducation - films\nhave it covered.\nWhilst most people\nuse films for the\nsake of entertainment to\nenjoy themselves - to take a\nbreak from life\u2019s stresses, to\nescape from reality - they are\nalso capable of inducing the\nopposite effect: films have\nthe ability to make you more\nin tune with reality, to affect\nreality, and also to shape it.\nThe medium of film, especially\nin the current day, has a lot\nof power. And this power\nmakes it a very useful tool\nin furthering change in our\nsociety and worldwide.\nFilms allow a person to\nexpress their ideas and\nthoughts in a way that is\naccessible to the masses.\nThere are numerous films\nthat have been made over\nthe past years that have had\na visible impact in society,\nand have been used to speak\nout against injustices. They\nhave been used to start social\nmovements and they have\nbeen used in political propa-ganda. The film The Thin Blue\nLine literally saved an innocent convicted man\u2019s life; this\ndocumentary, directed by a\ndetective, used witness statements to re-enacted scenes\nof the crime, which led to the\nlifting of his sentence, leaving\nhim a free man. In Super\nSize Me, the American fast\nfood industry was put under\nscrutiny, causing a revolution\nin the awareness of obesity,\nits causes and its effects. The\nfilm even led to McDonald\u2019s\nremoving its \u2018super size\u2019\noption from all of its menus.\nThese are some examples of\ntangible results from a film\nlooking to create change.\nUsually, however, the impact\nof films is not quantifiable. It\nis more subtle and is often left\nopen to interpretation.\nWhether it has an observable impact or not, one\nthing is certain: these films\ncreate awareness. Following\nthe advertising tag line \u2018all\npublicity is good publicity\u2019, as\nlong as someone has seen a\nfilm with an aim of informing\nsomeone of a certain matter,\nwhether they initially agree\nwith its premise or not, they\nknow of it. This in itself is\nhalf the battle. Films like Ava\nDuVernay\u2019s brilliant 13th,\nwhich exposes a \u2018loophole\u2019\nin the 13th\namendment which\nabolished slavery in the U.S.\nwhile allowing minorities in\nAmerica to still be targeted,\nthe touching After Tiller,\nwhich attempted to educate\npeople on pro-choice, and\nCowspiracy, which managed\nto make almost everyone who\nwatched it to at least want to\ntry being a vegetarian, have\nimpacts that change the way\npeople think and feel. Something which cannot be put into\na statistic but in certain ways\nis much more important.\nWhile most films that have\nchampioned, or had the intention of furthering, a cause\nhave been documentaries,\nthey are not restricted to that\ncategory. Fictional films can\nalcoholic mother, they too\nsucceeded in gaining a lot of\nattention towards their subject\nmatter and in the case of\nRosetta, political attention to\nensure the payment of minimum wage to youth.\nA corollary of film being\na medium which allows any\nperson to express their ideas\nand thoughts however, is that\nany person can make use of\nfilm \u2013 there is no censorship\non their ideas. History has\nshown that films can have had\na disastrous effects on society\ntoo. Films such as The Birth\nof a Nation, which arguably\nled to the re-birth of the Klu\nKlux Klan through its degrading depiction of African\nAmericans, and the notorious\nGerman propaganda film,\nTriumph of the Will, which\npopularized the cause of the\nNazis, are good examples of\nthis. The impact of these films,\nwell known to all, shows the\npower of film in society. There\nis tremendous power and in\nthe wrong hands it can do\ntremendous wrong. But this\nalso means in the right hands\nit can do tremendous good.\nIn an age where films and\ndocumentaries are churned\nout in multitudes, there is no\nlack of informative material\nout there. Online streaming\nsites such as Netflix \u2013 which\nhas around 70 million view-ers, whilst creating a fair few\nextremely good documentaries of its own \u2013 further the\nmass of video content available for people to watch.\nWhile people are unlikely\nto pay to go to the cinema\nand watch a documentary,\nthey are much more likely to\ndo so in the comfort of their\nown home. Increased viewing\nmeans good news for documentary filmmakers, whose\nmain issue is actually getting\npeople to watch their films. As\nYariv Mozer, director of The\nInvisible Men, a documentary\nabout the plight of gay Palestinian men, said, \u201cSometimes\nraising the awareness of one\nperson, making him change\nthe way he looks at reality, at\nlife, will show when he meets\nsomeone in need, these are\nthe small things that will make\na big change\u2019\u2019. And as history\nhas shown, raising awareness\nis something film can do very\nwell.\nMeryl Anil\n\\\\ Films change the\nway people think\nand feel \\\\\nstill carry a strong message\nand connect with people.\nOne could say it might even\ncreate more empathy as,\nbeing a work of fiction, the\ndirector is able to create\nmaterial to cater to audiences\nemotions, whereas with a\ndocumentary film, usually\nthe directors have to play\nwith whatever material they\ncan get which often consists\nof what can be thought as\n\u2018dry\u2019 material. Films such as\nThe Cider House Rules, a film\nabout back-alley abortions,\nand Rosetta, which follows a\n17-year-old girl looking for\nemployment to escape her\nFilms in protest\n\\\\ \u201cJust raising the\nawareness of one\nperson, making him\nchange the way he\nlooks at reality, at\nlife, will show when\nthey meet someone\nin need. These are\nthe small things that\nwill make a big\nchange\u201d \\\\\nThe Birth of a Nation (1915), One of\nthe most influential films of all time.\n\\\\ Epoch Producing Corporation\n\\\\ Films have the\nability to make you\nmore in tune with\nreality, to affect\nreality and also, to\nshape it \\\\\nFantastic\nBeasts and\nWhere to\nFind Them\nU\nnless you live\nin a cave, it is\nquite hard to\noverlook the fact\nthat Fantastic\nBeasts and\nWhere to Find Them is finally\nout. First of all, it is difficult\nto walk down an entire street\nwithout seeing at least one\nposter, and secondly because\nthe film has immediately\nbecome a source of wild\ndisputes. Surprisingly, it\u2019s\nnot a conflict between\nPotterheads passionately\ndefending the film and the\nothers condemning it \u2013 from\nmy experience, it is often\nquite the opposite. What is\nthe reason behind this and\nhow well did Fantastic Beasts\nactually do?\nMy first impression after\nleaving the theatre was that\nthe film was very wrongly\nadvertised as another Harry\nPotter story. It is easy to see\nwhy the fans of the original\nseries might be disappointed\n\u2013 it is absolutely not. You will\ncome across references to\nHogwarts and its characters\nfrom time to time, but apart\nfrom those, expect a story\nwhich takes place in the same\nworld with the same rules,\nbut explores a completely\ndifferent aspect of it. Fantastic\nBeasts is not a children\u2019s tale\nanymore, it is an adult one.\nSo, a piece of advice: drop\nyour expectations of Harry\nPotter 8 \u2013 there is the Cursed\nChild for that \u2013 and try to\naccept it as a new era of J.K.\nRowling\u2019s magical universe.\nBased on the trailer, I was a\nbit sceptical whether the plot\nwould be strong enough to\nhold your attention for over\ntwo hours. After all, it\u2019s \u201conly\u201d\na hunt for magical animals,\nisn\u2019t it? Luckily, I was more\nthan pleasantly surprised by\na presence of another, rather\nunexpected, storyline which\ngives the film a good balance\nof light-hearted and dark\nmoments. Moreover, there\nare many brief but important\nscenes which reveal that there\nis a lot going on under the\nsurface. Of course, I won\u2019t\nspoil it but let\u2019s say that it justifies the need for four more\nparts. Well, at least it does\nfor me!\nThe beasts are one of the\nhighlights of the film. Some\nare cute (like Niffler!), others\nhilarious and yet others,\nawe-inspiring. It is very satisfying to see they are not there\nfor the sake of CGI show-offs\nbut each have a unique\npersonality and you\u2019ll surely\nfind one you\u2019ll love (Niffler!).\nSpeaking of effects, one has\nto admit some of them might\nbe just for eye candy, but\nFantastic Beasts doesn\u2019t rely\non digital tricks as its main\ndriving force. And, to be\nhonest, who doesn\u2019t want to\nhave their breath taken away\nby a majestic Thunderbird?\nAs for the human char-acters, I\u2019m sure everyone\nhas been in love with Eddie\nRedmayne aka Newt Scamander several months before\nthe premiere but the others\ndeserve at least equal credit\n\u2013 charmingly quirky Queenie,\nslightly creepy Credence, and\nJacob Kowalski, the most likeable muggle \u2013 oops, meant\nNo-Maj \u2013 you\u2019ll ever meet.\nYou may feel a bit nostalgic\nabout not being able to watch\nthe characters mature as in\nHarry Potter, but you can\nenjoy different aspects of the\nmagical world, like the interaction of wizards with the rest\nof the world, and the struggle\nthey had to go through for\ntheir \u201cdeviation\u201d. Moreover,\nwith five films in total, you\u2019ll\neventually grow up with the\ncharacters as well!\nOverall impressions? My\ninner fangirl is screaming\nincomprehensibly, but even if\nI should be objective, Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find\nThem is in no way disappoint-ing. Even if you are not fan\nof Harry Potter, I suggest\nyou give it a go \u2013 Fantastic\nBeasts is trying its best not to\nbe like its older sibling, and it\nsucceeds.\nT\nhe directorial\ndebut from Czech\ndirectors Petr\nKazda and Tom\u00e1s\nWeinreb \u2013 I, Olga\nHepnarov\u00e1 \u2013 takes\nits title from a line in the\nmanifesto left behind by the\nlast woman to be executed\nin Czechoslovakia. In 1973,\nat the age of 22, Hepnarov\u00e1\nran over a group of people\nwith a truck, killing eight, and\nwas executed with short-drop\nhanging. But the title also acts\nas an invitation. It invites us\nto try and get inside the mind\nof a killer to attempt to shed\nsome light on what, exactly,\ndrove a young girl to commit\nsuch a horrific act. A pity,\nthen, that the end result is so\ndark and unilluminating.\nWe follow Hepnarov\u00e1 from\nthe age of 13, when an early\nsuicide attempt led to her\nincarceration in a psychiatric ward. This marks the\nfirst step in a progression of\nevents marked by increasing\nisolation and alienation,\nwhich Hepnarov\u00e1 deals with\nby chain-smoking cigarettes\nand maintaining an impassive\nattitude. The scenes come\nand go in a haphazard order,\nwith individual depressing\nvignettes making up a more\nisolating whole; with no music\nto break up the tension, the\ninternal relentless rhythm of I,\nOlga makes it a trying watch.\nMichalina Olszanska\u2019s\ndedication to the role of\nHepnarov\u00e1 cannot be denied,\nbut her character is a glassy-eyed cipher, whose extreme\nunlikeable nature hampers\nany emotional connection we\nmight have. Furthermore, the\nfact that Hepnarov\u00e1 is a lesbian seems to serve no other\nfunction that to justify the\ninclusion of several sex scenes\nthat are as gratuitous as they\nare dull, making I, Olga\nseem more like a pastiche\nof \u2018difficult\u2019 European arthouse cinema than anything\nfully-realised.\nI, Olga invites us to explore\nthe nature of human evil. But\nnot even the sumptuous black\nand white cinematography,\nwhich complements the 1960s\nenvirons perfectly \u2013 and takes\nmore than a few cues from\nPawe\u0142 Pawlikowski\u2019s Ida \u2013\ncannot rescue it. I, Olga goes\nto great lengths to prove true\nHannah Arendt\u2019s claim that\nthe evil really is just banal.\nEddie Redmayne making new friends\n\\\\ Warner Bros/Allstar\nEyes of a killer \\\\ Media Brigade\nI, Olga\nHepnarov\u00e1\nFred Fyles\nVeronika \u0160igutov\u00e1\n\n"

Those\nopinions are an expression\nof a frustration, and in\ndelegitimising the opinion, the\nfrustration is also not taken\nseriously. Since the outlet of\nthat frustration is the opinion,\nand political correctness does\nnot allow the legitimisation\nof the opinion, political\ncorrectness became the target\nfor Trump supporters and\na larger motif representing\nthose factors which are\nkeeping these people \u2018down\u2019\nand causing the frustration in\nthe first place. If Donald Trump\nwas anything he was politically\nincorrect, and because he\nwas not afraid to speak his\nmind, he became a symbol of\nlegitimising their frustrations.\nRepeatedly Trump made the\npoint that the biggest problem\nhe felt America was facing was\npolitical correctness, and it\nseems his message resonated\nwith his supporters.\nIn a weird way, although\nthe views he was expressing\nwere reprehensible, the\nviews themselves mattered\nless than the fact that\nthey were a middle finger\nto the politically correct\nstatus quo. Perhaps this\nexplains why some people\nwho maybe didn\u2019t actually\nsupport Trumps\u2019 views\nbacked him.\nWhat about those who\ndid support him and his\nviews? There could be a\nnumber of explanations.\nFirstly they genuinely were\nracist and xenophobic\npeople. Secondly their\nviews were a result of\nmisplaced economic woes.\nAfter the fall of the Berlin\nwall, it was said that\nhistory had ended. There\nwas no other challenger\nto liberal democracy, and\nthe world would progress\ntowards homogenisation.\nBut with the rise of liberal\ndemocracy, the prosperity\nbrought by that same\nsystem hasn\u2019t filtered down\nto the masses. They have\nnot shared in the same\nprosperity. Median male\nincome today in America\nis still less than it was in\nthe 70\u2019s according to The\nEconomist. For the white\nmale demographic, the\nrise in liberal democracy\nhas not been synonymous\nwith rise in their economic\nstatus.\nBut why does that\nlead to racist and\nxenophobic viewpoints?\nFor generations white\nAmericans, whose privilege\nand identity were treated\nas almost God given, have\nnever had to ask questions\nof identity, privilege, race\nand all other questions\nminorities have had to deal\nwith for their own survival.\nThis survival instinct in\nmy opinion creates a\nphilosophical revolution\nwithin minorities who\nbecome galvanised to take\ntheir equal seat at the table\nof society. That awakening\nleads to intellectual\nself-determination. This\ncoupled with the actual\nsocial actions are hard\nfought victories for the\npeople, and Hilary\u2019s\nsupporters, those who\nuphold the ideals of\nliberal democracy, are\nthose people. They may\nnot agree with all of\nHilary\u2019s track record, but\nthey would choose Hilary\nover Trump because she\nsupports similar ideals.\nThe white-male\ndemographic has never\nhad to go through similar\nintellectual and social\nupheavals because their\npositions in society and\ntheir identity is treated\nas a birth right and\nembedded in the way\nthings work, and that\nproduces a civilizational\narrogance and pride. This\ndemographic has not seen\nthe economic prosperity\ntheir country has produced\nand has seen its identity\nchallenged and chipped\naway. As a result of this\nidentity complex, they\nare more likely to seek\nsocial explanations for\ntheir frustrations which\ninclude blaming refugees,\nimmigrants, and all that\nthey feel is a threat to that\nidentity. The slogan \u2018Make\nAmerica Great Again\u2019 is\na throwback to when that\nidentity reigned supreme\nand so did their bank\nbalances.\nBrexit and the Trump vote\nmay show that the masses\nhave voted to reject the\nideals of open markets and\nliberal democracy as long\nas economic prosperity\ndoesn\u2019t filter down to\nthem. This doesn\u2019t question\nliberal democracy, but\n\\\\ Those opinions\nare an expression\nof a frustration, and\nin delegitimising\nthe opinion, the\nfrustration is also not\ntaken seriously \\\\\n\\\\ We also need to realise\nthat if we don\u2019t take people\u2019s\nfrustrations seriously that\nfrustration can manifest itself\nin many ways \\\\\nrather shows that economic\nprosperity must come\nhand in hand with social\nprogression.\nOver the course of\nhistory we have seen how\neconomic frustrations have\nmanifested in the rise of the\nfar right and caused once\nconsolidated identities\nand its associated self-pride to be chipped away\nleaving a vacuum for an\nideologically dubious\nstrongman to take control\nand create an enemy to\ngalvanise their supporters.\nThe target is usually\nimmigrants and minorities.\nIn a world where borders\nare as porous as ever,\nand different cultures and\npoints of view are mingling\nbecause of the movement\nof vast swathes of people,\nit is most important that we\nremain open minded.\nWe also need to realise\nthat if we don\u2019t take peoples\u2019\nfrustrations seriously, that\nfrustration can manifest\nitself in many ways.\nDonald Trump\u2019s win may\nbe one such manifestation.\nWhilst political correctness\nshould never be a vehicle\nto completely silence\npeople and their opinions,\nit should not also become\ncompletely overturned to\nnormalise hate which may\nmanifest and encourage\nhateful acts against\nminorities who have fought\nhard for the status quo to\nbe changed.\n\n"

You would\nagree a time and place to\nmeet, either some shady\nalley or perhaps one of your\nhouses if you were actually\nfriends. Drugs would then be\ntransacted, for a probably\npre-determined price, with the\npurchase method being cash.\nThere are several downsides\nto this delivery method. Firstly,\nif you\u2019re not well acquainted\nwith this dealer there could\nbe issues with quality. If you\ndon\u2019t know them well, and\nthey\u2019re not counting on your\nrepeat business, they\u2019re\nmuch less likely to give you\nthe high-quality items you\ncrave. And, it\u2019s not always\nIf you\u2019re struggling with drug\nuse, visit talktofrank.com\nconvenient to meet said\ndealer. Especially when\nyour tasty pile of cocaine\nis running dry at six o\u2019clock\non a Tuesday morning, it\u2019s\nhardly likely they\u2019ll be awake\nand ready. Add into this the\nimprobability that your dealer\nhas a chip and pin machine,\nand one can see why technology might offer a new and\nmore exciting method of drug\ncollection.\nTechnology has recently\ngiven us marvels such as\nmobile phones, 3D printing\nand electric cars. It has also\ngiven us the dark web. The\ndark web, for those unac-quainted, is World Wide Web\ncontent that is only accessible\nwhen using special software\nlike the Tor browser, which\nbounces communications\naround a distributed network\nof relays around the world,\nmaking it difficult for somebody watching your Internet\nconnection to learn what\nsites you visit. As a result,\nthis prevents those crafty\npolice officers from tracking\nwho you\u2019re messaging, what\nporn you\u2019re watching, and\nwhat drugs you\u2019re buying. It\nis possible to buy anything\non the dark web, from your\nmate\u2019s Uber account details\nto your mum\u2019s phone number.\nTread carefully or your\nfriends will buy you a mail\norder Thai bride. The system\nis very similar to browsing\nthrough Amazon for head-phones. You can view the\nbest-selling cocaine products,\nhighest-rated MDMA, and so\non. You can even give feedback after purchasing your\ndrug (or other illegal item),\nto ensure that other addicts\nlike yourself are aware of the\nquality.\nThe first online dark web\nmarketplace was Silk Road.\nLaunched in February 2011,\nit was operated by an\nAmerican whose real name\nis uninteresting. However,\nhe often referred to himself\nonline as the much more\nimpressive \u2018Dread Pirate\nRoberts\u2019. After a lengthy\ninvestigation by the FBI,\nSilk Road was shut down\nin October 2013. But, you\nknow what they say: you can\nnever keep a good drug/arms\ndealer down. As a result, Silk\nRoad 2.0 went live soon after,\nbefore being taken down\nonce again by the sneaky\nFBI. We are now on the third\niteration of Silk Road.\nCompetition is fierce in the\ndark web market. Alphabay\nis now the largest vendor, but\nthe number of sites available\ngrows regularly. With over 20\nstill alive to our knowledge,\nthe FBI are simply unable to\npoint their big Trump-shaped\nweapons in the direction of\nthe problem. Governmental\ndepartments cannot crush this\nphenomenon without destroying the Internet.\nThe process of buying on\nAlphabay is simple. First,\nselect the drug you want\nand the desired amount you\nrequire. Purchases are usually\nmade through Bitcoin (more\non that another time), an\nonline currency available for\npurchase using conventional\nmoney. This is to avoid the use\nof debit/credit cards, another\nform of accountability.\nAfter this, the largest flaw in\nthe plan appears. The drugs\nhave to be sent somewhere,\nthus lifting the veil on the\noh-so-sacred shadowy\nnature of the dark web.\nDespite this, upon filling out\nthe address you want your\ndrugs delivered to, a few\ndays later your order will\nbe delivered to your door.\nHow exciting! I know I have\nalready compared this process to an Amazon shopping\nexperience, but it really is\nremarkably similar.\nNow at this point, some\nof you may be asking such\nquestions as, \u201cHow is it at\nall safe to order drugs to an\naddress?\u201d, and \u201cSurely it\u2019s\nobvious you\u2019re going to get\ncaught?\u201d Both valid questions\nthat I asked when I first heard\nabout the system. Well to\naddress the issue, I did some\n\u2018investigation\u2019, and found\nsome people who were testing this method, purely for the\nsake of curiosity, obviously.\nThis is what went down. A\nquantity of marijuana was\nordered and after a few\ndays a box was delivered\nto the house. Not just any\nbox though. A cellophane\nwrapped Wi-Fi router box.\nThis was confusing at first;\nthe box was unwrapped and\nafter digging through layers\nof tinfoil there was a vacuum\npacked quantity of marijuana.\nFascinating. So not only was\nthe package vacuum sealed,\nit was buried under a mountain of aluminium, placed in a\ndeceptively labelled box and\nthen resealed in cellophane.\nNaturally, the seller received\na five-star rating.\nTechnology appears to be\ntaking over every aspect of\nour lives. If recent innovations\nallow Amazon to brutalise\nthe British high street, there\nappears no reason why\nsimilar technologies cannot\ndo the same to those who sell\ndrugs. With the level of #inno-vation relentless, it seems\nthere is no aspect of society\nsafe from the advancement\nof the interconnected world.\nEven, it seems, traditional\ndrug dealers.\n\\\\ You know what\nthey say: you can\nnever keep a good\ndrug/arms dealer\ndown \\\\\n\\\\ I did some\n\u2018investigation\u2019 and\nfound some people\nwho were testing this\nmethod, purely for\nthe sake of curiosity,\nobviously \\\\\n\\\\ Naturally, the\nseller received a\nfive-star rating \\\\\n\\\\ Traditionally,\ndrugs have been\nbought by ringing\nup your friendly\nneighbourhood\ndealer \\\\\nMasturbation [mas-ter-bey-shuhn] :\nErotic stimulation, especially of one\u2019s own genital organs commonly resulting in orgasm and\nachieved by manual or other bodily contact exclusive of sexual intercourse, by instrumental\nmanipulation, occasionally by sexual fantasies, or by various combinations of these agencies\nY\nes, masturbation.\nWe all do it,\nand those who\nsay they don\u2019t\nare probably\nlying. Right?\nWell, actually, maybe not.\nThe felix Sex Survey reveals\nthat year on year, about\n10% of us never indulge in a\nlittle self-pleasure, with that\nnumber skewed by around\na quarter of the women who\nnever polish the pearl. So\nmaybe we\u2019re not all choking\nthe chicken, but the question\nreally is, should we be?\nDespite the age-old rhetoric\nthat wanking is bad for you,\nwill make hairs grow on the\npalms of your hands, and will\nmake you go blind, jacking\nand jilling off is actually good\nfor you. It\u2019s known to relieve\nstress, help you sleep, and is\neven known to help prevent\nprostate cancer. Are you\nreally that healthy if you\u2019re\nnot giving the monkey a\nhealthy spank every once in\na while?\nMasturbation is the best\nway to get to know your body\nand what you like, which\nmeans that those who are\nstroking the salami regularly\nare likely to have better sex\ntoo. After all, how are you\ngoing to show the people\nyou\u2019re having sex with what\nyou like if you don\u2019t even\nknow yourself?\nBut wait, I hear you cry! I\n(am one of the 58% of men,\nand 72% of women at Imperial that) have a partner \u2013 I\ndon\u2019t need to masturbate! It\u2019s\ntrue that the topic of gilding\nthe lily can be a bit of a\nsticky subject in a relation-ship. Some people feel guilty\nabout getting off without their\npartners, and some even go\nso far as to consider it cheating (because those pesky\ninsecurities call for the thought\npolice). Certainly it\u2019s a bit\nawkward if your boyfriend is\nworking on a problem sheet\nand you\u2019re sat in the corner\nrubbing one out, but with\nappropriate boundaries,\ncleaning the rifle can balance\nout uneven sex drives and\nprovide some of the me-time\nthat us millennials forget so\noften.\nAnd moreso, we should\nbe talking about it. We\u2019re\nsocialised to have such a high\nlevel of shame about flicking\nthe bean, but it\u2019s something\nthat almost everyone does.\nWomen tend to fall into\ntwo categories: those who\nvehemently deny that they\ndo it, and those who gather\nin groups to swap Lovehoney\nrecommendations. Men are\nmore likely to acknowledge\nit casually, but God forbid\nthey would have a serious\nconversation about tossing the\nturkey (festive! #BlackFriday).\nBut why is this? There\u2019s a lot\nof knowledge to be gained\nfrom sharing your experience\nwith others, whether it\u2019s\na recommendation for a\ncheaper Hitachi alternative,\nor a suggestion for how long\nto microwave that melon for.\nBeing open with your friends\nabout jerking the gherkin\nis a good step towards\nbeing open with your sexual\npartners, and that can only\nimprove your sex life.\nSo now we\u2019ve established\nthat we should be doing the\nfive knuckle shuffle, let\u2019s talk\nabout how, and how often.\nFrom our felix archives, we\nknow that (unsurprisingly) the\nmen of Imperial are taking\nthe sausage hostage more\noften than the women are\nclubbing the clam, with most\nmen flipping the dolphin at\nleast a few times a week.\nThe girls are clearly busier,\nwith most only finding time\nto double-click the mouse a\ncouple times a week. People\nare all different, and as long\nas you\u2019re not breaking the\nlaw and your bits aren\u2019t sore\n(unless that\u2019s what you\u2019re\ninto), there\u2019s no such thing as\ntoo much. Just make sure you\nget those lab reports finished\nat some point, okay?\nThe ladies are also much\nmore likely to have gadgetry\nassistance. Once they get to\nthird and fourth year, most\ngirls will own at least one sex\ntoy (does it make diddling the\nskittle more efficient, or are\nthey just too lazy to air the\norchid manually?), but men\nvery rarely dance around\nthe maypole using anything\nother than their hand and\nmaybe some lube. It\u2019s best to\nmix it up with new sensations\nsometimes: men-friends, I\u2019m\nbuying you all Tenga eggs for\nChristmas.\nPersonally, I like to finish\noff my days with a bit of Etsy\nkimono shopping. Sometimes\nit\u2019s a frantic expression of\nhorniness, and sometimes\nit\u2019s time that I set aside for a\nbit of self-care at the end of\nthe day. Bashing the Bishop\nis something that you should\ndo for you, as it has the great\nbenefits of making you feel\ngood about yourself, while\nimproving the sex you have\nwith other people (although\nno-one will ever make love\nto you like you do). So get\nout there and make momma\nproud. Play pocket pinball\nto your heart\u2019s content \u2013 you\ndon\u2019t need to be ashamed.\n\\\\ Sometimes it\u2019s a\nfrantic expression of\nhorniness \\\\\n\\\\ Are you really\nthat healthy if you\u2019re\nnot giving the\nmonkey a healthy\nspank every once in\na while? \\\\\n\n"

    "content": "felix C U L T U R E\n20 felixonline.co.uk/culture culture.felix@ic.ac.uk Friday 25 November 2016\nIn Rick Famuyiwa\u2019s Dope,\nJay-Z\u2019s Blueprint is described\nas the \"punctuation mark to\n90s Hip-hop\". It seems to me\nthat, in many ways, Albert\nCamus\u2019 The Rebel is the\npunctuation mark to 19th, and\nearly 20th\ncentury philosophy.\nCamus is often regarded,\nrightly, as an absurdist\nand, more questionably, as\na humanist. In his earliest\nworks, Camus took a purely\nabsurdist stance: questioning\nthe meaning of life and\nwhether it was worth living at\nall. However, his experiences\nas part of the French\nResistance during the Second\nWorld War galvanised his\nbelief in the importance of\nsafeguarding all human life.\nIn his first post-war novel,\nThe Plague, the protagonist\npins down the crux of Camus\u2019\nstance \u2013 there is no grandeur\nor heroism in saving lives; it\nis simply what must be done.\nThe Rebel, arguably the\nphilosopher\u2019s most important\nwork, is the culmination of\nthese ideas.\nIt is an exploration of\nrebellion and revolution,\nboth metaphysical and\nhistoric, in the context of the\ndominant philosophies and\nartistic movements of the\nera. Taking a harsh lens at\nboth the French and Russian\nRevolutions, The Rebel\nconsiders the noble birth\nof rebellion and its ultimate\ndomination and corruption\nby firm ideology. More than\nthis, it offers a just way to\nlive while making the world a\nbetter place.\nMoral absolutism and\nunflinching adherence to an\nideology are highlighted as\ndangerous pitfalls that quickly\nlead the revolutionary into\ndoing more harm than good.\nIndeed, this may seem ironic\ngiven the previously stated\ncommitment to absolutely\nprotecting life. However, one\nof the book\u2019s great strengths\nis that this principle is derived\nlogically, with no appeals to\nmorality. The reader is invited\nto satisfy themselves of this\ndeduction, rather than accept\nit as an a priori. In fact, one\nof the great strengths of the\nAlbert Camus | The Rebel\nAnurag Deshpande\n\\\\ The Rebel is\nthe punctuation\nmark to 19th\nand\nearly 20th\ncentury\nphilosophy \\\\\nAlbert Camus in 1957 \\\\ Robert Edwards/Creative Commons\nwriting is precisely this. No\nunjustified demands are made\nof the reader, and the tone is\nnot fierce or overly fanatical.\nThe titular rebel is\ncharacterised succinctly: an\nindividual who sees inequality\nor injustice being exercised,\neither upon themselves or\nothers, and desires its end.\nCamus begins with man\u2019s\nmetaphysical rebellion\nagainst God. Dostoevsky\u2019s\nIvan Karamazov is cleverly\nsummoned here to give form\nto the quintessential rebel.\nThe suffering of a child in this\nworld is considered too steep\na price to pay for God and\nthe eternal kingdom in the\nnext one. Ivan\u2019s rejection of\nthe Divine encodes one of the\ncentral themes of The Rebel,\nthe idea that suffering today\ncannot be forfeited in favour\nof some nebulously defined\nfuture utopia. Poetically,\nIvan\u2019s later fate, left unsaid by\nCamus, also analogises the\naforementioned corruption\nof rebellion. In general, the\nwork argues that ideals must\nend when they demand the\ndebilitation or destruction of\nothers.\nCamus chastises the French\nRevolution for its eventual\ntreatment of the nobility.\nHe astutely points out the\njuvenility of the wanton\nslaughter undertaken in an\nattempt to tear down the\nprinciple of Divine Right and,\nby extension, God. He then\n\\\\ True rebellion\ndoes not deal in\nabsolutes, it is\ninstead a neverending battle to\ndemand better \\\\\ntackles the philosophical\nbehemoth of the 20th\ncentury,\nNihilism. By pointing out\nthe logical inconsistencies\nwithin it and its unsavoury\naspects, he strives to tear\ndown the seemingly utopian\nidealism of the time. The\nfalse promises of Nazism\nand Communism are shown\nto simply be the old wolf\nof religion in new clothing.\nHeaven is replaced with\nsome infinitely far off perfect\nworld, where the 'temporary'\nsuffering and slavery of\ncertain people now is justified\nby the 'eventual' ultimate\nfreedom of all. Indeed, the\nbravery of this stance must\nbe praised. At the time of The\nRebel\u2019s publication, much\nof the French intelligentsia\nwere avid supporters of\nCommunism. Camus was one\nof the few willing to make a\n\\\\ Camus rails\nagainst the\nphilosophy of\njustifying temporary\noppression for future\nutopia \\\\\nstand.\nRebellion tends to evoke\nimages of violent conflict.\nThe Rebel shows us that\ntrue rebellion is the exact\nopposite. It is not the fight\nfor absolute freedom, which\nmeans the freedom of the\nstrong to dominate the weak.\nNor does it desire absolute\njustice, the application of\nwhich necessitates a fascistic\ndomination of everything. It is\ninstead a never-ending battle\nto demand better. It is self-sacrifice, and valuing your\nfellow man above all else.\nVigilance must be maintained\nfor that which would sacrifice\nlife today for an unknown\ntomorrow. Camus\u2019 greatest\nwisdom lies in recognising\nthat rigid adherence to any\nideals is dangerous, and that\nideals cannot supplant reality.\nBut, in the spirit of his voice,\ndon\u2019t take my word for it,\nread The Rebel.\n\n"

This\nis the final round of drafting,\nfeedback, and re-drafting of\nthe proposals, in a process\nthat\u2019s been ongoing since the\nstart of this calendar year.\nThe previous round of\nconsultation revealed,\nunsurprisingly, that the\ndiffering categories of\nstudents (broken down into\nfirst year undergraduates\n(UGs), second year UGs\nonwards, and postgraduates)\nhad different opinions on what\nmattered most. \u2018Fun events\u2019\nand Clubs, Societies & Projects\n(CSPs) were most important to\nfirst year UGs; in comparison,\nmental health/wellbeing was\nmore of a priority for UGs in\ntheir second year onwards.\nPostgraduate students felt\nthat CSPs mattered most to\nthem as well, alongside the\naforementioned \u2018fun events\u2019\ncategory, whatever that\nmeans.\nA survey on the Union\nand felix) are performing and\non an existential level, what\ntheir purpose is. The initial\nversion of the survey that\nwas circulated was fraught\nwith both grammatical and\nformatting mistakes making\nsome questions impossible\nto answer properly, or at\nall. It also asked students\nto directly comment on the\nperformance of the purely\nstudent volunteer-run ICTV\nand IC Radio. This was later\namended to focus just on the\nperformance of felix due to\nits sabbatical editor. Feedback\non other sabbatical roles was\nnot requested.\nThe final strategy will be\nsigned off by the Board of\nTrustees in December and\nthen enacted at the very start\nof next year.\nThe survey can be\ncompleted via www.\nimperialcollegeunion.org or\nfeedback can be given at\nsessions at various campuses\nthroughout this month.\nConcerns were also raised\nabout the effects that such\nradical restructuring might\nhave on SOLE scores.\nAs some evidence exists\nsuggesting that SOLE rewards\nenthusiastic lecturing often to\nputting too much pressure\non many already overworked Imperial academics.\nImperial can be a very high\npressure environment, not\nonly for students but also\nfor researchers. We raised\nquestions such as: \u2018Does the\nnew strategy have mechanisms\nin place that will look into\nthe welfare of Imperial\nresearchers and lecturers?\u2019,\n\u2018If someone is not necessarily\nvery good at lecturing, will\nthat have an impact on their\ncareer?\u2019, and \u2018How is College\nlooking into how this will affect\nstaff?\u2019\nCollege and Union\nrepresentatives replied\nreassuringly. \u201cIt\u2019s important\nto create a safe space during\nthis exercise and maybe let go\nof SOLE scores for a while,\nbecause those are the kinds\nof things that will keep people\nbehind\u201d, said Buitendijk. When\nasked about the consequences\non staff careers in the case\nof failure to embrace the\nnew teaching framework, it\nwas made clear that the new\nstrategy was more about the\ncarrot than the stick.\nYet these changes might have\nto progress faster than some\nmight feel comfortable with.\nWith higher education getting\nmarketised and becoming\nmore of a product, especially\nin the wake of a post-Brexit\nBritain, improving teaching\nstandards will become a\nmarketing priority.\nAt the moment, the\ndiscrepancy between teaching\nand research is a problem:\n\u201cWhenever we come to\ntry and find the marketing\nmessages around the college,\nit is very much centred around\nour research expertise and\nfabric to reopen under strict drug control\nBecause who doesn\u2019t love soberly flailing about to techno?\nunited behind us.\u201d\nPerhaps this marks a change\nin the tide of club closures in\nLondon.

The\nsame can be said of any form\nof art. Truly meaningful art\ncan confront the viewer with\nthings they don\u2019t want to hear,\nideas they didn\u2019t know even\nexisted \u2013 it can be a painful\nprocess. As Didion puts it:\n\"you want to tell somebody\nyour dream, your nightmare.\nWell nobody wants to hear it,\nnobody wants to walk around\nwith it.\"\nArt has a long and rich\nhistory with protest. From\nPicasso's Guernica, to the\nwork of Guerilla Girls\nprotesting the sexism of the\nart world, artists have used\ntheir work to shed light on the\ninjustice of the world around\nthem.\nIn the 1980s, the AIDS\ncrisis descended on the gay\ncommunities of the liberal\ncoastal cities of America \u2013\nNew York, San Francisco,\nand Los Angeles \u2013 without\nwarning. These were the\ncities where young gay\nmen had moved to finally\nlive in relative safety from\nthe violent homophobia of\nmore rural areas. Before\nHIV, these communities were\nplaces where young people\nfound connections that they\nhad been denied growing\nup. Seemingly overnight,\nyoung people, who were\nalready stigmatised and\nisolated from wider society,\nlost friends, exes, lovers.\nWhole communities were\ndying of rare cancers.\nIn H is for Hawk, Helen\nMacDonald describes the\nact of losing loved ones as\nlife becoming \"a thing made\nof holes. Absences. Losses.\nThings that were there and\nare no longer\". Life in the\ncommunities affected by\nAIDS must\u2019ve seemed an ever\nwidening chasm, a gaping\nwound of loss after loss that\nthreatened to swallow them\nwhole as well.\nAt first politicians refused to\nacknowledge the epidemic;\nthen, they talked openly of\ntattooing patients with their\npositive status, of confining\nHIV-positive individuals to\ncamps; the governor of Texas\nwent as far as saying \"if you\nwant to stop AIDS, shoot the\nqueers\". A generation was\nbeing wiped out whilst their\ngovernment took no action to\nstem the deaths.\nIn anger, in desperation,\ngay artists did the only thing\nhad the power to alleviate\nsuffering, and chose to do\nnothing, to reckon with the\nblood on their hands.\n\"To make the private into\nsomething public is an action\nthat has terrific repercussions\non the pre-invented world\"\nis the philosophy by which\nWojnarowicz created his\nwork. In her astonishingly\nbeautiful book The Lonely\nCity, Olivia Laing, terms the\n'pre-invented world' as the\n\"existence of mainstream\nexperience, which seems\nbenign... its' walls almost\ninvisible until you\u2019re crushed\nagainst them\".\nMuch of oppression, of\ninjustice, is about erasure:\nthe refusal to see injustice\nor inequality, denying a\nvoice to those who are\nmarginalised. In the face\nof this, \u2018to make the private\npublic\u2019 is a powerful act.\nCarry That Weight is perhaps\nthe most recent iteration of\nthe statement in the art world.\nIn this feat of endurance\nperformance art, Emma\nSulkowicz, a Columbia\nUniversity visual arts student,\ncarried a mattress resembling\nBreakingthewallsofthe'pre-inventedworld'\nIndira Mallik\n\\\\ This can only be\ndone by refusing to\nbe silenced; art is\na way of speaking\nup \\\\\nthey could do: they made\nart. The ACT UP movement\nlikened the AIDS crisis with\nthe Holocaust, reclaiming the\npink triangles Nazis used to\npublicly label homosexuals.\nIn One Day This Kid David\nWojnarowicz surrounded\na photograph of himself\nas a gap toothed smiling\nboy with a prophecy of his\nfuture: \"One day this kid will\ndo something that causes\nmen...to call for his death...\nhe will be subject to loss\nhome, civil rights, jobs, and\nall conceivable freedoms. All\nthis will happen when in one\nor two years he discovers\nhe wishes to place his naked\nbody on the naked body of\nanother boy\". Wojnarowicz\u2019s\nwriting is lyrical, visceral, and\nclearly deeply personal. Yet\nthat boy, the young David,\ncould be a figure from a\nNorman Rockwell painting,\nan all-American boy, no\ndifferent from any of the\nsons of the politicians who\nwere overseeing a kind of\ngenocide; Wojnarowicz\u2019s\nwork, for all it\u2019s confessional\nqualities, is universal.\nWhen David Wojnarowicz\nhimself died of AIDS,\nhis funeral was a protest\nmarch,which eventually\nculminated in his ashes being\nscattered on the White House\nlawn along with the ashes\nof other victims of AIDS.\nIt was a heart-wrenching,\ndesperate way of holding the\ngovernment accountable for\nits neglect; forcing those who\nthe one she had been raped\non wherever she went for\nmonths, vowing she would\ndo so until her rapist left\nthe university. It was an\nextraordinarily brave act in\na culture in which women\nwho come forward with\nstories of their assault are\nimmediately shamed, or\naccused of lying to destroy\na man\u2019s reputation. Through\nthe mattress, Sulkowicz made\nthe painful emotional weight\nof her assault tangible, made\nit impossible for the people\naround her not to address her\nstruggles, her demands.\nIn a world of rising injustice\nit\u2019s easy to think: what good\ncan some splotches on a\ncanvas do? What good are\nwords in a play, or a story?\nBuilding a more liberal\nworld is more than changing\nlaws. It's about changing\nperceptions. This can only\nbe done by refusing to be\nsilenced; art is a way of\nspeaking up, in Didion\u2019s\nwords, it is a way of \"tricking\n[the viewer] into listening to\nthe dream\".\n\\\\ In anger, in\ndesperation, gay\nartists did the only\nthing they could do:\nthey made art \\\\\nL J Roberts. Gaybashers, Come and Get It, USA, 2011 \\\\ Courtesy of Blanca Garcia\nB\ny now, it\u2019s a near\ncertainty you\u2019ll\nalready have\nheard about Vice\nPresident-elect\nMike Pence\u2019s trip to\nBroadway\u2019s hip-hop musical\nsensation, Hamilton. If you\nhaven\u2019t, it\u2019s all rather simple:\nPence went to the show,\nand following the curtain\ncall, one of the cast stepped\nforward and addressed\nPence directly. Flanked by\none the most diverse casts on\nBroadway, Brandon V. Dixon\n(the show\u2019s Vice president\nAaron Burr) read a speech\nwritten by Hamilton creator\nLin-Manuel Miranda, director\nThomas Kail, and producer\nJeffrey Seller from a piece of\npaper: \"We are the diverse\nAmericans who are alarmed\nand anxious that your new\nadministration will not protect\nus, our planet, our children,\nour parents, or defend us\nand uphold our inalienable\nrights.\" Dixon went on to ask\nPence to \"work on behalf of\nall of us\u2026 men and women of\ndifferent colors, creeds and\norientations.\"\nPence, to his credit (not\nwords I ever thought I\u2019d\nwrite), took the whole thing\nrelatively well, revealing that\nhe \"wasn\u2019t offended by what\nwas said.\" He praised the\n\"incredible\" show and the\n\"incredibly talented\" cast, but\nadded \"I\u2019ll leave to others\nwhether that was the appropriate venue to say it.\" But\nif Pence took the (relatively)\nhigh road, his boss opted for\na lower one. Through that\nmost Presidential of mediums,\nTwitter, President-elect Donald\nTrump claimed that the cast\n\"harassed\" Pence, before\ninsisting that \"the Theater\nmust always be a safe and\nspecial place.\" He\u2019s wrong.\nThe theatre is special, yes, but\ntheatre is not safe.\nTheatre can\u2019t be safe. To\nbe effective, to provoke, to\nchallenge, theatre cannot\nfull well what they are in for,\nbecause you (quite simply)\ncannot book a ticket for\nHamilton without knowing\nanything about it. Somebody\nlike Pence is not a helpless\nindividual, quite the opposite.\nThey hold the power.\nWith Pence comes an\nopportunity. A chance to challenge that power, to address\nhow it is used. A direct\naddress, from a multi-racial\ncast, many of whom are part\nof the LGBTQ+ community,\nto a man who has thus far\nproven himself anything but\ntheir ally, is just an extension\nof the theatre that came\nbefore it. It is a request for\nrespect, a plea to be heard\nand treated as equals. It is an\naction with profound mean-ing, as profound as anything\nthat occurs in the preceding\nmusical. To brand that action\nas \"harassment\", to demand\nan apology, to insist that theatre be seen as a \"safe space\",\nis to miss the point entirely.\nTheatre is a live medium. It\nWe,thepeople|TheHamiltoncastspeakout\nJack Steadman\n\\\\ Theatre is by its\nvery nature not safe\n- it shouldn't be \\\\\nafford to be safe. Safe means\nboring, and boring does not\nchange minds. Boring doesn\u2019t\nchallenge people\u2019s opinions,\ndoesn\u2019t make them assess\nwhy they believe what they\nbelieve.\nHamilton used to challenge\nopinions, with great success,\nbut with its success has come,\ninevitably, a neutering. Its\naudience now is almost\nentirely comprised of the\nfaithful or those with enough\nmoney to afford a seat.\nHamilton\u2019s message \u2013 that\nAmerica is, and always has\nbeen, a nation of immigrants,\nfounded on cooperation and\ncompromise \u2013 needs to be\nheard, but the people in that\ntheatre aren\u2019t the ones who\nneed to hear it. Hearts are\nbeing stirred, but minds are\nnot being changed in the\nauditorium of the Richard\nRogers Theater. Until the\nmoment where someone like\nMike Pence walks in \u2013 a man\nwho has promoted conversion\ntherapy for homosexuals, a\nman serving in an administration that has unmistakably\naligned itself with the euphe-mistically-named 'alt-right'\n(or, in plain English, 'white\nsupremacist') movement.\nAnybody walking into\nHamilton does so knowing\nworks in the here and now:\nit may draw from the past,\npresent, and future, but it is\ninescapably of the moment.\nIts very nature isn\u2019t safe: as\na live event, countless things\ncould go wrong. Every effort\nis made to prevent that, but\nit is a human medium. The\nthoughts and ideas of the\nwriter are made flesh by the\nactors on stage (and the crew\nbehind them), and communicated to the audience in\nthat room. To be \"safe\", to\nnot provoke in any way, is to\nwaste the immense power that\nconnection wields.\nThe cast of Hamilton knew\nthis. They knew that theatre\nallows for the speaking of\ntruths, and on this occasion\nthey chose to embody that\nliterally. They stepped for-ward, and they spoke truth\nto power. They embraced\ntheatre at its purest \u2013 the\nwords of a writer, spoken\nthrough an actor, addressed\nto an audience. In the face\nof hatred spreading across\nthe world, they made a polite\nand respectful gesture, using\ntheir position to speak for\nthose who could not. It wasn\u2019t\n\"safe\", because it couldn\u2019t be.\n\\\\ We are the\ndiverse Americans\nwho are alarmed\nthat your new\nadministration\nwill not protect\nus, defend us\nand uphold our\ninalienable rights \\\\\n\\\\ Michel e Carla\n\n"

We start with a\nshort warm up, essentially a\nglorified keep-away which\nis entertaining and accentuates the quick footwork I\u2019ll\nbe requiring later on in the\nsay, this would be interesting.\nI\u2019m given some club-owned\nequipment, which is provided\nfree for trainees. This is\na massive advantage for\nthose wanting to try fencing\nout, a sport which could set\nsomeone back a few hundred\npounds if you decide to invest\nin your own kit. The accessibility is impressive, but I\u2019m\njust delaying the inevitable\nparticipation. I put on my\nmask, a fetching jacket and\nam handed an \u00e9p\u00e9e. I looked\ngood. \u00c9p\u00e9e is a thrusting\nweapon (calm down) and\nso the point acts as a button\nallowing a hit on any part of\nthe body to count. Guess it\nwas a bad day to wear shorts\nand forget a cup.\nI\u2019m thrown straight in\nagainst a member who promises he\u2019ll go easy on me. I\nclumsily salute, struggle to get\nmy mask on over my glasses\nand enter the En Garde\nposition. We begin, I attempt\nto remember footwork, but\nmy opponent strikes a point\nwhile I\u2019m looking at my feet.\nI concentrate on keeping\nthe sword tip correctly\npositioned and he strikes my\nlegs. It\u2019s safe to say I closely\nresembled an inebriated man\nsquaring up to a lamppost.\nMy opponent continues to\nscore multiple points without\nbatting an eyelid but I perse-vere. Some feigned attacks\nand lunges (helped by my six\nfoot height) score me a couple\nof well placed points and I\nstart to find a rhythm with\nthe defensive and offensive\nflow, a natural characteristic\nof the sport. I lose 5-3 but I\nfind myself wanting to hone\nmy skills and try the other\nweapons out, but alas my time\nis up. I thoroughly enjoyed\nmy time as a fencer and I\nencourage you to join the\nclub which has a strong roster\nof experienced members on\nhand. There\u2019s a gentlemanly\nmanner to the sport you\nwouldn\u2019t see in most sports\nand a constant stream of hints\nand tips to help members\nadvance their ability. Yes you\nneed money for equipment,\nbut the club helps you out. Yes\nit requires expertise but there\nare plenty around who can\nhelp you out. Yes you get to\nattack fellow students without\nrepercussion but \u2026 OK, that\u2019s\na good point but hopefully\nyou get the idea.\nIf you ever fancy giving\nFencing a go, get in touch\nwith the club via the union\nwebsite. En Garde!\nsession. Whilst the rest of\nthe beginners continue their\nwarm ups, I\u2019m taken away to\nexpand on that footwork.\nWhat followed was a whis-tle-stop-tour of fencing terms\n(all French, few remembered).\nFeet must be positioned\nperpendicularly, lead with the\ndominant foot but lunge from\nthe rear, legs bent and no\nroom to take the Piste (fencing\npun intended). I get a sense\nof the many years of history\nbehind the sport, where traditions of duelling are ingrained\ninto each fencer. My trainer,\nFilip, is clearly enthusiastic\nand explains each element of\nthe sport with gusto and clar-ity. Around us, the members\nof the IC team are battling\naway in one of three weap-ons: sabre, foil and \u00e9p\u00e9e. IC\u2019s\nsuccess with this particular\nsport comes as no surprise\nwith constant encouragement and advice exchanged\nbetween opponents.\nThe time comes for me to\nwade into a fight of my own.\nOne thing you should know\nabout me, I would not hurt\na fly. Correction, I could not\nhurt a fly. I\u2019d happily let it\ntake my lunch money then\ncomplete any of its outstanding homework. Needless to\nAmericanFootballmakePirateswalkplank\nImraj Singh\nrunning into the end zone,\nwhilst destroying a Pirates\nplayer, with the sound of\nshivered timbers for miles\naround. In all seriousness\nwe hope the Pirate was OK.\nThe two point conversion\nwas caught by Ben \u201cMassive\nhands\u201d O\u2019Brien who really\nstepped up after being called\nout by a coach, great game\nfor the kiddo and we look to\nseeing many more.\nThe final score was 14-0\nwith a complete defensive\nshut-down. We defend our\nhouse. Next game is versus\nRoyal Holloway Bears.\n#OurTurf #Hus-tleHitNeverQuit\n#MakeImmortalsGreatA-gain #BecomeImmortal\nI\nt has been a rough road\nfor the IC Immortals,\nrecently relegated\nfrom the highest tier of\nAmerican Football in the\ncountry, to Division one.\nImmortals have now had the\nsweet taste of victory that had\nbeen missed so dearly.\nAfter a close overtime\ndefeat, Immortals were fearful\nof a repeat of the previous\nseason. The idea that the\nlower division would be a\ncake-walk was shattered. The\nfact that the team they were\nplaying, UEA Pirates, had just\ncome away with a convincing\nvictory over the RH Bears did\nnot help to settle their nerves.\nUEA were predicted to win.\nThe game started off with\nImmortals kicking off, the\nPirates received and were\nstopped almost immediately.\nThis was a theme for the\nrest of the game. UEA were\nstopped at every attempt\nto move the ball with\nPanukorn \u201cNao Knee Teddy\u201d\nTaleongpong and Jack\n\u201crumple-master\u201d McCarthy\nstuffing up any attempt at\nrunning up the centre. When\nthey gave up on the middle,\nTeddy (the Thai train), could\nbe seen coasting across the\nfield making big hits with\nDaim \u201cquestion-master\u201d Tariq\nblowing the Pirates offense to\npieces. Jason \u201cno fly-zone\u201d\nPatrick Kuilan managed to\nget two picks as linebacker,\nstatistics hail the man as a\nbeast.\nIt can\u2019t be said that the\ndefensive side of the ball\nwas perfect, with a lot of\nopportunities missed by\nthe Pirates\u2019 offense. It can\nbe said that the Immortals\u2019\noffense missed out on a\nlot more opportunities. It\nwas the rookie (not really\nrookie, just new to Immortals)\noffensive duo wide receiver\nAaron \u201cdon\u2019t trust with\nyour daughter\u201d Wilson\nand quarterback Jason\n\u201cthe human glitch\u201d Patrick\nKuilan that stole the show.\nA fantastic pass and insane\ncatch between the two got\nthe first touchdown of the\nday. The next came with\nJason on a QB scramble\nWeekendactionforICFencing\nL\nast weekend was the\nopening bout of the\nImperial Women\u2019s first\nseason at Oxford.\nUnlike our other\nteams, the Women\u2019s\n1s are in the Premiership,\nwhich is the top league and\nextremely competitive. In this\nleague it is usual to do all\nthe matches in two or three\nintense weekends rather than\nweekly. First up on Saturday\nwas Cardiff, which Imperial\nwon with an impressive\nscore of 130-107. The second\nmatch was against local\nrivals UCL, which Imperial\nagain won 131-113. The final\nmatch of the day was against\nCambridge where Imperial\nwere narrowly beaten by only\nnine hits, with an overall score\n111-120. There was only\none match for the Women\u2019s\n1s on Sunday, against the\nhosting team, Oxford, where\nImperial were unfortunately\nbeaten with an overall score\nof 124-94. This means that\nthe Women\u2019s 1s have won\ntwo and lost two in their first\nfour matches, putting them in\na pretty good position going\ninto the match against last\nyear\u2019s Championship winners\nSurrey.\nWell done to all the\nteam, especially to Maria\nConstantinescu and Sherry\nXu for their first team debuts\n(even if Maria did miss the\nbus to Oxford after having\noverslept). A special mention\nalso to Niamh Spence who\nhad her Imperial debut at\nthe weekend and fenced\ntremendously, including a\n14-5 win. Also a big thank\nyou to alumnus Zoe Robinson,\nwho made time to come down\nto watch, coach and support\nthe team.\nIt wasn\u2019t just the Women\u2019s\n1s in action over the weekend\nthough. In Manchester, Jamie\nSimpson and Harry Peck\nfenced in the Elite \u00c9p\u00e9e event\nat the Manchester Fencing\nCentre. Jamie came 33rd\nout\nof 59 and Harry, fresh from\nwinning the Irish Open last\nweekend, claimed bronze \u2013\nthe third time he has done so\nthis season.\nThis week the fencing\nteams start their cup\nmatches; the Men\u2019s 1s are\nfencing Cardiff at home,\nalongside the 2s who face\nCity University and the\nMen\u2019s 3s are in action\nagainst Brunel away. The\nWomen\u2019s 2s are fencing\nCambridge 2s, also away.\nIf you want to find out the\nresults before next week\u2019s\nFELIX, check out Imperial\nCollege Fencing on Twitter\n(IC_fencing) or find us on\nFacebook.\nJamie Simpson\n\\\\ A big thank you\nto alumnus Zoe\nRobinson, who\nmade time to come\ndown to watch,\ncoach and support\\\\\n\\\\ Whilst destroying\na Pirates player,\nwith the sound of\nshivered timbers for\nmiles around \\\\\n\\\\ Blade Fencing Equipment\n\n"

This fish,\nsupposedly meant for two\npeople, was more than a\nfamily feast.\nThe salads that came with\nthe fish did not lack in effort\nand helped to add a layer\nback into the food triangle:\nthe Yesil Salata was a simple\nsalad with rocca, a tougher\nversion of our usual rocket\nleaves, while the Gavurdag\nwas a refreshing mixture of\ngreen and red tomatoes with\nwalnuts and mint.\nA dinner party cannot end\nwithout a sweet note. A selection of desserts was served,\nalong with strong Turkish\ncoffee and Turkish delights.\nS\nometimes I wish\nI could duplicate\nmyself. One to go\nto those dreaded\n9am lectures,\none to do the\nlaundry and one to tend to\nthe exploding experiments\nin the lab. And at the end of\nthe day, we can all gather\nand dine at one of the many\nrestaurants on my to-visit list.\nThere\u2019s nothing wrong with\ndining on your own, you may\nsay. For most cases, I agree.\nI can shamelessly walk in,\nask for a table for one, then\nspend the entire meal staring\nat a wall. I\u2019m totally comfortable with that. But there are\nplaces where singletons are\na no-no, and this is still true\nwhen it comes to tapas-style\ndining.\nYes, the art of sharing food\nhas finally graced this cold,\nselfish land where stealing\na chip off your companion\u2019s\nplate was once a much\nfrowned upon act. Why keep\nall the food to yourself when\nyou can order more, fill the\ntable and share the guilt with\na friend?\nOne such restaurant to\nintroduce the sharing culture\nis Yosma, where I had been\ndying to visit ever since they\nopened in August. This latest\naddition to the Marylebone\nfood scene is a restaurant and\nbar combining the three main\npillars of Istanbul\u2019s dining\nculture: meyhane (a word\nmeaning tavern), mangal\n(barbeque) and seafood.\nThink plates of mezze, kebabs\nand Turkish delights for\ndessert. If cloning technology\nhad advanced past Dolly the\nsheep I would\u2019ve been with\nmy cohort of Christys weeks\nago.\nThanks to my blogger\nfriends, I need not wait until\nyear 2198 to satisfy my\nhunger for grilled lamb chops\nand manti (Turkish dump-lings). I received an invite\nto experience the meyhane\nside of life: the vibrant Turkish\nculture of food sharing, conversation and bottomless raki,\nquenching the thirst of the\nstomach and the soul.\nThe evening started off\nwith me being late again,\nsprinting down Baker Street\non heels and sweating in the\nearly September breeze. The\nrestaurant was an entirely different world, sheltered from\nthe rush-hour street outside:\nrelaxed, cosy and dimly lit,\ncomplete with dark wooden\ntables and two huge olive\ntrees in the centre, hip music\nand light-hearted chatter\namongst the occasional clatter from the open kitchen.\nCocktails are always the\nbest introduction to any\nrestaurant. Yosma\u2019s cocktail\nmenu comprised of a handful of unique cocktails, all\ninspired by Turkish culture-with names taken from love\npoems. My favourite was the\nSil Bastan, a sweet cocktail\nwith yoghurt gin, Manuka\nhoney, milk acid, egg white\nand lemon. Yoghurt-flavoured\nfoam floated on top of the\nbittersweet mixture, strong\nenough to deflate the stress\nfrom a long day. The other\none worth mentioning was\nYosma, a fruity, bitter, red\nnumber with Turkish apple tea\nvodka, pomegranate,\nvermouth and raki spices.\nWith everyone comfortably seated and the shy\nhandshakes transformed into\nintimate conversations, we\nwere introduced to the heart\nof meyhane: raki.\nRaki is a strong Turkish,\nanise spirit, served to pair\nwith the many plates of\nmezze and to accompany the\nhours of delightful laughter\nthat followed. To start off,\nwe took a sip of the clear,\nstrong-smelling liquid from the\nspecially-designed glasses.\nThat was a powerful hit to\nmy system. Then, following\nthe traditions, we diluted the\nremaining with water and ice,\nlooking on in wonderment as\nthe alcohol turned opaque in\ncontact with water. Salgam,\na sour turnip juice that tasted\nrather like pickle juice, was\nhanded around to cleanse the\npalette from raki.\nThe mezze plates came one\nby one, and soon filled the\ntable with more than plenty\nto share. Each one designed\nto match the accompanying\nraki.\nThe Kavun was more than\njust melon and feta. Take a\nbite of melon, a sip of raki\nand a chunk of soft feta with\nbasil olive oil to cleanse the\npalette. The hummus was one\nof the best I have ever tasted:\ncreamy, garlicky and not too\nmuch tahini. The Fava looked\nlike panna cotta, but made\nwith crushed broad beans\nwith olive oil and dill. The\nPast\u0131rma, which was a dish\nof paper-thin slices of cured\nbeef, gave a spicy, flavourful\nkick to balance the raki. The\nLevrek Marine was a more\nexotic version of a carpaccio,\nwith marinated sea bass,\ngrapefruit, fennel and green\nchilli. I was torn between the\nK\u00f6poglu and the Pancar as\nmy favourite mezze \u2013 the\nformer was soft chunks of\nsweet aubergine in yoghurt\nand the latter being a beautifully presented dish of sweet,\npit roasted golden beetroot in\ngarlic oil.\nIf you thought that was the\nend of the meal, you\u2019d be\nvery, very wrong indeed.\nTurkish cuisine is known for\nits generosity, meaning more\nthan enough food to satisfy\nyour stomach at appetisers\nalready \u2013 with the mains\nstill cooking in the kitchen.\nSo, when the mains were\nannounced it almost felt like\nan anticlimax, which instantly\nturned into surprised exclamations as the humongous,\nmonstrous, barbequed whole\nfish arrived steaming hot\non its silver platter, its thick,\ncharcoal-coloured skin scored\nto reveal the pearly-white\nflesh beneath. The meat was Christy Lam\nApart from spending a good\namount of time trying to\ndecrypt our futures from the\nsludge of coffee grinds at the\nbottom of our cups, we took\ncare to enjoy the traditional\ndesserts. The kunefe definitely\nhad substantial wow-fac-tor with its crispy, golden\nyellow Kadoyif pastry and\nits incredible white cheese\nstrings, temporarily silencing\nour worries for our hips. The\nSambali was a chunk of fluffy\nsemolina cake, served with\nmastic (a fragrant plant resin\nused in Turkish desserts) ice\ncream, reminiscent of the\nlunchtime sponge cakes from\nmy school days. The Armut\nPismaniye comprised of half\na poached pear balanced\non top of a perfect sphere\nof ice cream, with a cloud of\ncotton candy and a generous\nhandful of walnuts.\nSatisfied after almost four\nhours of non-stop feasting,\ntalk and laughter, we called\nan end to the meet-up,\nexchanged eager hugs that\nmatured from the raki and\nheaded home to rest our\nbellies for the next day.\nFollow Andrada as she tries to follow\na recipe, takes a two hour detour and\nresigns to eating store bought cake\nwhile waiting for her pie to cook\nFollowing a recipe is not as easy as it sounds\nT\nhe most challenging\nthing for me is to\nfollow a recipe:\nI rarely do it, as\nmost of the time\nI only improvise\nwith what I have in the\nkitchen or what is given to me\n(thank you, nice people who\nstopped eating my food and\nstarted bringing their own).\nSo imagine me standing in\nfront of a cookbook, trying to\nunderstand how things work\n\u2013 some Chemistry labs have\nless complicated instructions,\nI swear!\nBut the good part is that\nthe food was supposed to be\nready in 30 minutes \u2013 yes,\nyou\u2019ve heard me right! Just\n30 minutes for a multiple\ncourse meal and dessert! And\nenough food for four people.\nThe student\u2019s dream, right?\nYou may say I\u2019m a dreamer\nand you are right: no real\nfood is done in 30 minutes,\ntrust me. There were eight of\nus chopping and doing all the\npreparatory work \u2013 OK, let\u2019s\nbe fair, eight people, some\ntrying to do things while the\nothers tried not to be in their\nway.\nThings became rather\ncomplicated. Ok, let me start\nthis over, in a more simple\nmanner: My friends and I\n(eight people in total) decided\nto have a Friday night dinner,\ntrying to make the food\nfollowing one of Jamie\u2019s 30\nminutes recipe: Chicken Pie,\nFrench Style Peas, Sweet\nCarrot Smash and Dessert\n(supposedly Berries, Shortbread & Chantilly Cream).\nThe problems started when\nwe decided (we, not just pretentious me!) that we didn\u2019t\nwant to buy rolled puff-pastry\nPastry\nMix the salt and flour. Add\nthe butter, broken up into\nsmall pieces and mix all the\nand we wanted to make our\nown. This single step took\nthree hours, but if you can\nfollow any googled recipe\nand not start a flour fight\n(please, don\u2019t!), then you\u2019ll be\nfine in 50-60 minutes. Also,\ndon\u2019t let a bunch of incapable students who\u2019ve never\nstepped in the kitchen before\nattempt this part \u2013 the pastry\nDO NOT start throwing it\nat other people! Add just\nhalf the water and whisk\neverything together before\nadding some more. In the\nend, you should get a pretty\nsolid piece of dough. Cover\nthe bowl with cling film and\nlet it rest in the fridge for 20\nminutes. The last step: take\nout the pastry and roll it out,\nthen wrap it (take the upper\nthird and fold it to the centre.\nDo the same for the lower\nthird and repeat this two to\nthree times \u2013 the more times\nyou repeat it, the puffier the\npastry will be). Put the pastry\nback in the bowl, re-cover\nwith cling film, and let it rest\nanother 20 minutes in the\nfridge.\nEasy-peasy, right? Almost as\neasy as going to a shop and\npicking a pre-made one from\nthe tens of options. Which\nyou can totally do, if you feel\nlike baking is a bit out of your\ncomfort zone or too much for\nuni life.\nWhile waiting for the dough\nto chill, it\u2019s finally the time\nto start taking care of all\nthe nice things that wait for\nyou on the counter! Finally!\nBefore actually starting, you\nmight want to preheat the\noven (200-225 \u00b0C).\nChicken Pie\nSlice the chicken breasts\ninto strips. Add the strips, the\nbutter and some olive oil to a\nlarge pan and cook. Meanwhile, slice the (spring) onions\nand the mushrooms. Add\nthem into the pan with the\nmustard, one spoon of flour,\ncream fraiche and chicken\nstock. Stir and then leave to\nsimmer until tender.\nAfter the mixture is sim-mered, add it into a pan,\nslightly smaller than the\npastry sheet. Cover the pan\nwith the pastry sheet. Quickly\nbeat the eggs and brush the\npastry all over. Put it in the\noven and let bake for 15\nminutes, until golden.\nSmash\nCook the carrots until tender\n(enough to be easily cut with\na fork) in water with a pinch\nof salt. When tender, drain\nthe water and smash them\nusing a potato masher, food\nprocessor, or even a fork,\nas we did. Yes, you might\nneed some brute force. While\ndoing this, you might want to\nadd a bit of olive oil.\nPeas\nCut the lettuce as finely\nas possible. Put the chicken\nstock into a pot and add the\nmint leaves and the flour and\nwhisk for a little while. When\nit boils, add the chopped\nlettuce and the peas. Season\nwith salt, pepper and some\nlemon juice to taste. Let it\nslowly cook for 10-15 minutes\n(when the peas are soft\nenough).\nThe final conclusion: no, we\nwere not capable of cooking\nthe food in just 30 minutes\nand we ended up having a\nreally late dinner, but the\ninstructions were easy to\nfollow so everything ended\nup being nice and simple\nand, more importantly, FUN.\nYes, cooking is fun when done\nwith friends, so what about\nyou stop reading about it and\ngo for it!\nP.S. You might want someone else to clean the pots and\ndishes afterwards!\nAndrada Balmez\nIngredients:\nFeeds 4 people\nPastry\n250g white plain flour\n1 tsp fine salt\n250g butter\n200ml cold water\nOr, use a sheet of ready\nmade puff pastry.\nChicken Pie\n4 skinless chicken breasts\nButter\nSpring onions (we used\nnormal onions)\n150g button mushrooms\nFlour\nCreme fraiche\n300ml chicken stock\nThyme\n1/3 of a nutmeg, grated\n(which we forgot to add)\n1 egg\n2 tsp English mustard\nSmash\n1 kg carrots\nFresh thyme (we also\nadded some basil, just\nbecause we like it)\nPeas\n2 little gem lettuces\nButter\nFlour\n300ml chicken stock\nMint\n500g frozen peas\n1/2 lemon\nSeasonings\nOlive oil\nExtra virgin olive oil\nSalt and black pepper\nDessert\nCheesecake bought and\neaten while waiting for\neverything to be ready\nmight need to be remade.\n(No, not everything can be\nsalvaged, unfortunately).\ningredients together.

If you see similar categories\nyear after year after year\nthere are things you need\nto pay attention to.\u201d said\nBuitendijk.\nIndeed, Imperial College\nhas consistently done poorly\nwhen it comes to the student\nexperience and this year\nImperial dropped from\nnumber ten to 21 out of 24\nRussell Group universities.\nMany of the main issues that\nplague student satisfaction at\nImperial are familiar to most\nstudents and include density\nof curriculum, a stressful\nassessment process and\noften poor-quality feedback\nthat doesn\u2019t allow time for\nreflection or improvement.\nHowever, Buitendijk also\npointed out the inconsistency\nof student satisfaction across\ndepartments, which only\nexacerbates the feeling of\ndiscontent.\n\u201cSome students are\nabsolutely happy with the\nteaching they\u2019re getting. They\nlove their teachers, they rave\nabout the stellar researchers\nthat teach them and how\nwonderful that is and other\nstudents will have exactly\nexplain why some students\nhave a really good experience\nand others don\u2019t that really\nleads to disgruntlement. I think\nwe see some of that in the\nNSS,\u201d said Buitendijk.\nThe strategy so far appears\nto focus on a few key points.\nFirstly, emphasis is put on\nidentifying the pockets of\ngood practice across various\ndepartments, collecting them\nand implementing them at a\nCollege-wide level. Another\narea of focus is curriculum\nassessment. Buitendijk stressed\nthe importance of creating \u201ca\ncurriculum that goes beyond\nfacts\u201d, in an effort to equip\nstudents with transferable\nskills for \u201cjobs that don\u2019t even\nexist yet\u201d. Finally there will be\na push to restructure teaching\nand learning by making\nresearch-backed changes\nthat will elevate teaching to\nmatch the level of the research\nundertaken at Imperial. To\nachieve these goals, there are\nlong-term plans to not only\ndevelop education units that\nresearch and assess Imperial\u2019s\nteaching strategies, but to\neventually create \u201ccentral\nunits within faculties\u201d.\n\u201cIdeally they\u2019ll be\ndepartments with professors\nreal time polling and a\npanel discussion. During\nthe discussion, several\nstaff members voiced their\nconcerns.\nSam Cooper, an Imperial\ngraduate and currently an\nEarth Science & Engineering\nresearch associate, pointed\nout that the problems the NSS\nscores have highlighted are\nwidely known.\n\u201cWe know that class\ninteraction has been the way\nto go for a very long time...\nIt\u2019s not as if we just found\nout how teaching should be\ndone.

When tissues\nare cooled, water molecules\nmove around much slower,\ninteract with each other more\nand begin to form ice crys-tals. These ice crystals tend\nto form first outside the tissue\ncells. This makes the concentration of other substances\noutside tissue cells much\nhigher and so, by the magic\nof osmosis, water molecules\nmove from inside the cells to\noutside. The ice crystals grow\nand the tissue cells shrink and\nare damaged by the newly\nformed ice crystals.\nVitrification is a method\nused to prevent this damage.\nTissues can be cooled and\n\\\\ Companies offer\ncryogenic freezing\nfor \u00a3160,000 a go \\\\\nsolidified, being preserved\nwithout any damage by\nreplacing blood with a\nsolution that is basically an\nanti-freeze combined with an\norgan preservation fluid. It\nallows tissues to be stored at\nextremely low temperatures.\nYou can imagine that there\nare many toxicity issues associated with this. Scientists are\ncurrently working on these\nproblems and the companies\noffering cryogenic freezing,\nfor \u00a3160,000 a go, are fairly\nconfident that with time, these\nissues can be solved!\nNow that we\u2019ve established\nthat there\u2019s a theoretical\npossibility for it to work, can\nit actually work in real life?\nWho knows! No one that has\nbeen cryogenically frozen has\nbeen brought back to life yet,\nhowever, success with cryonics\nTis the season to be... cryogenically\nfrozen?\nLizzie Riach explores new research into how wounds heal, and why older\npeople are at a significant disadvantage if they injure themselves\nWoundshealwith(alotof)time\nS\nince World War\nI, scientists have\nnoticed how the\nspeed of healing\nis much slower\nin older veterans\ncompared to younger ones.\nBut for an entire century, we\nhad no idea why this was the\ncase, until now.\nResearchers at the Rockefeller University have started\nto unlock this aspect of the\naging body by looking at\nwounds in mice. Usually when\nthe skin is broken due to an\ninjury, skin cells move to the\nsite to repair the break due\nto the coordination of nearby\nimmune cells. But in older\nmice, experiments showed\nthis communication between\nskin and immune cells to be\ndisrupted, slowing this process down.\nHealing wounds is one of\nthe body\u2019s most complicated\nprocess, with a host of different molecular pathways.\nSignalling between cells\noccurs from the first few seconds of injury to months after\nhealing has occurred.\nA crucial part of healing is\nthe formation of a scab, a feature that is in no means there\nto be picked. Its function is to\nprotect the open wound until\na more robust skin layer is\nformed. These new skin cells\nare known as \u2018keratinocytes\u2019,\nand fill in the wound under\nthe scab until all is healed. In\nthe older mice, the keratino-cytes were much slower to\nmigrate in place. The result?\nWounds in aged mice often\ntook many more days to\nclose compared to the\nyoung\u2018uns.\nThe work being done\ncould potentially be used\nto enhance healing in the\nelderly if we find out the\nspecific signals required.\nAs Elaine Fuchs, head\nof the Robin Chemers\nNeustein Laboratory of\nMammalian Cell Biology,\nsays, \u201cour work suggests it\nmay be possible to develop\ndrugs to help aging skin\ncells communicate better\nwith their immune cell\nneighbours, boosting signals that normally decline\nwith age\u201d.\nF\nact: There\u2019s a cat\nthat is co-author of\na theoretical physics\npaper.\nIn 1975, American\nmathematician and\nphysicist Professor Jack H.\nHetherington wrote an entire\npaper (on low temperature\nphysics, if you were wonder-ing) on a typewriter, only to\nbe told by his supervisor that\nit would be rejected by the\njournal he was intending to\npublish it in \u2013 Physical Review\nLetters \u2013 as had written \u201cwe\u201d\nand \u201cus\u201d throughout despite\nbeing the sole author.\nRather than re-type his\nwhole paper, he decided\nto add a worthy co-author\ninstead \u2013 namely one F.D.C.\nWillard. Which of course\nstands for FELIX Domesticus\nChester Willard. Which of\ncourse was his faithful Siamese cat.\nThe paper was accepted\nand published. F.D.C. Willard\nwent on to publish, as the\nsole author, an article titled\n\u201cTwo-, Three- and Four- atom\nExchange Effects\u201d\u2026 and no,\nI don\u2019t understand what that\nmeans either. Chester was\nregularly cited for his \u201cuseful\ncontributions\u201d and was even\noffered a physics fellowship\nat Michigan State University.\nThree gruelling years of\nNatural Sciences at Cambridge and there is some cat\nthat is objectively a more\nsuccessful scientist than I am. I\nmean what is the point...\nChester\nthe first\npublished Felix\nAnother one of Mr. Aran\nShaunak\u2019s Little Bites of\nScience\n@BitesOfScience\nhas been shown for IVF as it\nis used to preserve semen\nand eggs. There aren\u2019t even\nany cases of animals being\nsuccessfully revived either,\nbut a rabbit brain was\nreportedly recovered earlier\nthis year in an \u201cexcellent\u201d\nstate. Even with this success,\nthere is no evidence that\nbrain functions, personality,\nor memories would be\nrecovered.\nSo, what\u2019s the verdict?\nIf you have the money to\nspare, it might be worth a\ngo. It really depends on how\nmuch trust you have in the\nfuture of scientific progress.\nI\nt has been known for a\nlong time that galaxies\nmove, and our Milky\nWay is no exception.\nThe Milky Way and its\n50 neighbours, together\nreferred to as the \u2018Local\nGroup\u2019, have been moving\nin a particular direction, and\nuntil now it was not known\nwhy. A team of researchers\nfrom South Africa, Germany,\nand Australia suggest that\na supercluster of galaxies is\nthe reason behind the huge\ngravitational pull.\nA supercluster is a collection\nof hundreds of galaxies, and\nit\u2019s the largest structure known\nto exist in space. International\nresearchers measured around\n4500 redshifts (a change in\nwavelength, used to measure\ndistance), via the constellation\nVeta. They took measurements from galaxies either\nside of a plane of the Milky\nWay to determine the presence of a particularly high\ndensity of galaxies around\n800 million light years away.\nThis new supercluster is much\nlarger than the previously discovered Shapely supercluster,\naround 650 million light years\naway.\nThe galaxy\u2019s guide to hitchhiking\nThamesgetssealofapproval\nO\nver a pint in\nClapham,\nmy friend\nexclaimed\nthat they,\nalong with\nthe entire top deck of the\n345 bus, had seen a seal\nin the Thames on the way\nto college. At first I was\nsceptical. Whilst the odd\nwhale has occasionally\nbeen known to take a wrong\nturn, how could anything,\nespecially something as large\nas a seal, live daily in such\npolluted water?\nSurprisingly, the Thames\nisn\u2019t as bad as you\u2019d expect,\ndespite its history as a\nsewage sink and the countless chemical leakages. In\nthe almost 60 years since\nthe river was proclaimed\n\u2018biologically dead\u2019, strict\nlegislation implemented on\nwaste disposal has led to the\nThames now becoming the\ncleanest it\u2019s been in more than\n150 years. The transformation\neven won the International\nTheiss River prize for outstanding restoration in 2010,\nout-competing the Yellow\nRiver in China, the Hattah\nLakes in Australia, and the\nSmirnykh River in Japan.\nHabitat reconstruction projects have helped repopulate\nthe river with more than\n125 species of fish and 400\nspecies of invertebrates. Birds\nnow wade from its banks and\neven large vertebrates such\nas dolphins can be spotted\nregularly. The most impressive\nre-establishment of a marine\nmammal population comes\nfrom our British seal species:\nthe harbour seal and the grey\nseal. Over the last 15 years\nseal numbers have increased\ndramatically with over 900\nseals being estimated to live\nalong the estuary last year,\nan increase from the 708 in\n2013.\nDespite their increasing\nnumbers, Thames seal\npopulations are still very\nvulnerable to disease. The\nPhocine Distemper Virus\n(PDV), which causes fever\nand breathing problems,\nhas had major outbreaks\nin Thames seal populations\nin both 1988 and 2002.\nConservationists are now\nconcerned that with the\npotential for a 14-year\ndisease cycle the virus could\nrear its head again immi-nently. No evidence of PDV\nhas been found in the river as\nof yet.\nIn order to help conserve\nthe seals, which are top\npredators in important\nestuarine ecosystems, the\nZoological Society of London\n(ZSL) has been monitoring\ntheir progress. In 2012 the\norganisation tagged 10 harbour seals with GPS systems\nEmma Parkin talks seal sightings and how the Thames has cleaned up its act\nLara Bailey explains why the \u2018Vela Supercluster\u2019 could be the reason for why the Milky Way and\nsurrounding galaxies are constantly on the move\nand in 2013 they introduced\nannual population surveys\nusing planes and boats to\nget counts. However, one of\nthe most important sources\nof information comes from\nthe public driven Thames\nMarine Mammal Sighting\nsurvey which ZSL has run\nsince 2004. Within the first\nten years over 1,300 marine\nmammal sightings were\nrecorded, all of which were\ncrucial to better understanding our seals.\nSo, despite its murky\nappearance, the Thames is\na hospitable environment for\nmany creatures. Its biggest\nproblem now is plastic, with\ncampaigns such as #OneLess\ntrying to reduce levels of plastic pollution. If you want to\nsee one of our furry friends,\nyour best chance is currently\naround Greenwich! You can\nreport your findings to a live\nonline map or via the twitter\nhashtag #inthethames.\n\\\\ The Vela Supercluster is much bigger\nthan the previously\ndiscovered Shapely\nsupercluster \\\\\nDespite its size, it was only\nrecently found because it was\nhidden behind the cosmic\ndust and stars of the plane of\nthe Milky Way. The lead professor of the study, professor\nRenee Kraan-Korteweg of\nthe University of Cape Town,\nsaid: \u201cI could not believe such\na major structure would pop\nup so prominently.\u201d\nSuperclusters, due to their\nscale, have a significant\nimpact on the movement\nof other galaxies. Further\nresearch is needed to\nappreciate the influence and\nextent of the supercluster,\nand in particular to explain\nthe direction and velocity of\nthe Local Group\u2019s movement.\nMore observations will help\ndetermine the contribution of\nthe Vela supercluster to the\nlarger-scale structure of this\npocket of our vast universe.\n\\\\ Despite increasing\nnumbers, the Thames\nseal population are\nstill vulnerable \\\\\n\n"

Cocaine\u2019s\nglamorous fa\u00e7ade makes it\na drug for the wealthy party\nanimals of the west. They are\nrich, and the cost is irrelevant\n\u2013 even if that includes human\nlives.

From the\nget-go the audience is thrust\ninto the life of the world\u2019s most\nfamous drug trafficker and\nimmersed in the brutality with\nwhich he drowned the people\nof Colombia.\nSuch horror followed the\nroute his cocaine took to reach\nthe USA, as the trail of drugs is\nso often a bloody one. Now,\ndecades on and thousands of\nmiles away, it is interesting to\nprobe what the route of cocaine to the UK looks like and\nhow much destruction it really\ncauses.\nas simple as driving the product up to a different continent.\nThere\u2019s an ocean to cross.\nOnce crossed, the cocaine\narrives on the shores of West\nAfrica \u2013 a crucial transit point\nin its journey. It\u2019s estimated\nthat 18 tonnes of cocaine\npass through this area each\nyear en route to Europe. All\nthis amounts to a staggering\nwholesale price of $1.25 billion (more than the GDP of\nsome West African countries),\nso it\u2019s no surprise trafficking\nhas become a dangerously\nattractive market for people\nhere. The fact that West Africa\nholds some of the poorest and\nmost politically unstable countries in the world has been\nexploited, with Sierra Leone,\nGuinea-Bissau, Ghana and\nBenin being among the worst\naffected nations. Corruption\nis rife, security is weak, and\ngovernment resources are often surpassed by those of the\ntraffickers.\nThe industry is further facilitated by the Economic\nCommunity of West African\nStates (ECOWAS). Allowing\nfree movement of people and\ngoods between these countries means that cocaine can,\nin theory, move through the region relatively easily without\nborder controls. Traffickers\ncan also move between hubs\nand conduct operations with\nMuch of the celebrity drug,\nsnorted by the likes of Nigella\nLawson and Kate Moss, still\ncomes from South America\n(mainly Colombia, Peru and\nBolivia), as the problem was\nnever going to be eradicated\nalong with Escobar in 1993.\nBut the route to the UK is not\nminimal interference.\nAn example of a country\nplagued by the problems cocaine brings can be seen in\nGuinea-Bissau, a disputed\n\u2018narco state\u2019. Here, corruption runs from the very top\nthese wealthy people buying\na good time, and countries are\nkept subserviently poor to the\nadvantage of traffickers and\ntheir demanding customers.\nTo citizens of \u2018narco states\u2019\nthe consumers must appear\nto be a blend of selfishness\ncut with shallow minded ig-norance. With further analysis of certain cocaine users, I\nwouldn\u2019t be surprised if that\nwere true.\ngovernment politicians all the\nway down to the police on\nthe ground. Those who are not\ncomplicit can become casualties of the trade \u2013 these people include journalists, police,\nmilitary personnel and other\nofficials. Even the President\nisn\u2019t safe, with President Vieira\nbeing assassinated in 2009 \u2013\nwhile his assassination was not\ndirectly because of cocaine,\nthe drug played its part in raising tensions building up to the\nevent.\nThere is no shortage of terrible acts of violence related\nto the cocaine trade, often\naffecting high profile, influential individuals. But in turn, it\u2019s\nthe wider implications of such\nacts that becomes increasingly concerning. If politicians\nand changemakers are being\nbumped off left, right and cen-tre, how on earth is a country supposed to govern itself,\nlet alone develop? Not only\ncan nothing ever get done in\ngovernment where anyone\nwho opposes the traffickers\nis removed, but the people of\nGuinea-Bissau cannot lift themselves out of poverty because\nthe cocaine industry crowds\nout legal forms of economic\nactivity. Lack of legal businesses and job creation then leads\nto a poorly resourced govern-ment, and it\u2019s not as if they can\nstart taxing cocaine imports\nfor some kind of revenue. This\nbrings the country to a de-moralising standstill whereby\nlegitimate globalisation and\nself-improvement is thwarted\nat every turn.
