ICSM Ladies 1st XI was undoubtedly two points clear with a game in\nhand. A win on this surprisingly sunny\nMarch morning would lead us into the\n\ufb01nal match of the season, against second place Barts 1\u2019s, inevitable champi-ons! No pressure\u2026\nDespite missing two key players, there\nwas a quiet con\ufb01dence amongst the\nteam. his may have been due the addition of a strong second team player\nboosting our squad, Fiona Field, or the\nbirthday luck Elke Wynberg brings each\nyear. Maybe even the fact that we were\nentering the match with a string of wins,\ncumulating in a thrashing of our self-proclaimed league rivals, Vet\u2019s 1\u2019s, the\nteam who had previously hospitalised\nour star defender, Harriet Davidson! he\n\ufb01rst whistle went and action stations\nwere go, we started with the same pace\nand excellence we have demonstrated\nthroughout the season; beautiful, accurate passing, dynamic movement o\ufb00 the\nball and teamwork second to none.\nHowever the con\ufb01dence we maintained throughout the warm-up and\n\ufb01rst ten minutes, was quickly dashed\nwhen we realised this was something we\nwere going to have to \ufb01ght for. GKT 2\u2019s,\nour competent opposition, were not going to make this easy for us.\nWe sustained our \ufb01nesse despite continuous pressure from the opposition\nand our \ufb01rst goal came from a break\nfrom top forward Charlotte Lees. Faced\nwith a one on one against the already\nproved, excellent keeper, Lees kept her\ncool and the ball sailed over the keepers dive into the top of the net. Our second goal came from a well-earned short\ncorner; a set piece led captain, Rosie\nBelcher, to drive another past the Kings\nMedics defence.\nTwo goals up, the half was coming\nto an end, but the action wasn\u2019t over\nyet. GKT had kept the pressure high\nthroughout the half and \ufb01nally made\na successful break leaving the ICSM\ndefence in tatters as they knocked one\npast our goalie in a two-on-one, gutted!\nGoing into half time with the score of\n2-1 our goalmouth half time chat was\nagitated. We had had a good half with\nplenty of opportunities but had only put\ntwo away; even the umpire agreed we\nshould have been at least 4-1 up! With\nthirty-\ufb01ve minutes left of the game to\nclinch the league we vowed to go out\nand put an end to them, we wanted this.\nhe second half saw an unsatisfying\ntwenty minutes for both teams with\nfruitless attacks at both ends, de\ufb01nitely\nmore at ours, but I would say that! With\nfrustrations running high we really\nneeded another goal to secure the game.\nPlay picked up and the pizazz we had\ndemonstrated all season \ufb01nally resur-faced, proving we were deserved league\nwinners. Some excellent insight from\ncentre mid-\ufb01elder Charlotte Read gave\ncaptain Rosie another chance to slot a\ngoal away from the top of the D. With\nthe score now comfortably 3-1, this gave\nus the \u201cshot in the arm\u201d we needed to\n\ufb01nish the game with the majestic play\nwe knew we were capable of.\nOn the \ufb01nal whistle, we all attempted,\nand I most de\ufb01nitely failed, to control\nour excitement for a polite \u2018three cheers\u2019\nand hand-shake, before the whooping,\ncheering and ecstatic skipping began!\nhe umpires were only paid on the\nagreement they would take a celebratory photo, \u201chanks Roger\u201d\n. See inset,\n\u201cIt\u2019s not two chins, it\u2019s a neck!\u201d C. Read.\nIt may not have been the prettiest\nhockey we have played all season but\nthe \ufb01nal score, de\ufb01nitely re\ufb02ected all the\nhard work each and every member of\nthe team has put in this season. hanks\nguys!!\nA special mention needed for our\nwonderful and dynamic forwards, Lees,\nNat, Claudia and \ufb01nal year Alison who\nhave given us the boost we needed to\nreach our potential this season! And\nthank you to the twos captain, Becky,\nwho has never turned me down when\nI have been stuck! What a con\ufb01dence\nboost for Varsity! Bring it on\u2026 Lucky\nfor who? Us I hope.\nImperial College\u2019s \ufb01rst riding team\u2019s\npenultimate competition was hosted\nby the University of Kent. Although a\nbit cloudy on the long, early morning\ndrive to Canterbury, by the time we\narrived the sun was shining.\nhe dressage phase was \ufb01rst as\nnormal in the morning, and the four\nhorses were an interesting mix! Liane\nMarshallsay rode Willy, an enthusiastic\ndark bay cob, \ufb01rst and she rode a really\naccurate test to win on Willy, putting\n5 penalties on our nearest rivals Kent.\nhe second rider was captain, Rachel\nGregory, who rode a Kodjak: a dark\nbrown, surprisingly fast cob. Rachel\nrode an accurate test to put 11 penalties on the rider from Kent\u2019s team. Andre Wilmes was third and rode a really\nlazy cob called Vinnie, and despite his\nunwillingness to move, Andre won on\nhis horse as well, which was helped by\nthe Royal Holloway rider who couldn\u2019t\nget Vinnie going. Claudia Saksida was\nour \ufb01nal rider on her horse Cashew,\na chestnut sports horse. Claudia also\nrode a fantastic test to leave the Imperial team in \ufb01rst after the dressage on 0\npenalties, ahead of Kent on 26 penalties\nin second, Royal Holloway in third on\n80 penalties and LSE on 127 penalties.\nWe all had lunch in the sunshine before walking the showjumping course.\nWe were slightly disappointed by the\nheight, but not surprised because\nat our home competition two riders\nfrom LSE had fallen o\ufb00! he horses are\nshown before we have to ride them, and\nthe last horse to go, Warrior, was a bit\ndi\ufb03cult, which was slightly disconcert-ing! Claudia was the \ufb01rst to go on Holly,\na piebald mare who loved jumping and\nwas surprisingly fast, producing a clear\nround. Rachel was second to go on her\nhorse, Cody, a steadfast and reliable\nblack cob who did the minimum e\ufb00ort\nto go clear. Andre was the third rider\non Lady, a pretty grey mare, and he also\nwent clear. Our \ufb01nal rider was Liane,\nriding Warrior, who had already eliminated a rider from LSE, and Liane rode\na careful, calm and most importantly\nclear round.\nWe had a tense wait for the results\nas we knew they would be close as all\nthe jumping rounds were fairly simi-lar, with no major disasters to separate the riders. When the results were\nannounced the team had come \ufb01rst,\nAndre was 1st, Rachel 2nd, Liane 5th\nand Claudia 8th. As a result the team\nare well-placed to qualify for regionals,\nwith the \ufb01nal competition next week.\nProviding the team doesn\u2019t come last\nwe will have quali\ufb01ed! Individually,\nRachel is currently lying in \ufb01rst place\nindividually and is guaranteed a place\nat regionals and Andre is second, with\nLiane in 4th and Claudia in =9th.\nRachel Gregory Captain\nRiders rev up for Regionals\nTomorrow\u2019s burger\n\n"

This week has been\nabsolutely shattering. In\nfact, I am so tired that\nwhen I came into work\ntoday (Thursday) I put on my scarf,\nwent to the door, then turned around\nand looked for my scarf as I thought I\nhad lost it. It\u2019s just been one of those\nweeks. Work, sleep, eat: barely time\nfor relaxing at all. This is actually being\nwritten on a bus into College, just to\nprove that point.\nGarden Hall\nThink it\u2019s clear what the viewpoint\nis from me. Just keep Garden open.\nRenovate it and keep it here. It\u2019s very\nclose and very cheap. Everything else\nis going towards the expensive side\nin terms of accommodation and, let\u2019s\nface it, London is hardly going to become a cheaper city to live in. It\u2019s once\nmore incredible to see Imperial students stand up and denounce a terrible\nidea. I was very pleased to see the enthusiasm and boldness of the students\norganising the protests and getting\ntheir arts skills out with some pro level\nbubble letter making.\nOne thing that we absolutely don\u2019t\nwant is for people from less well-off\nbackgrounds being put off coming to\nImperial. If this is because of the accommodation offers that are available,\nthen that is such a shame. Garden Hall\n(and Weeks of course, as well as the\nhalls in Evelyn Gardens) is an amazing\nasset. It is cheap and just by campus.\nThis means people that can\u2019t afford\nexpensive halls still get to live near\ncampus. Having halls such as Garden\nmeans that you don\u2019t price out students from being in a great location.\nWould that space really be used well\nif it were to be office space? Wouldn\u2019t\nit cost money to redevelop the space\ninto office space? Surely just renovating the halls is a much better use\nof the money that it would cost? The\ncampaign to save Garden Hall should\nbe fully supported by all students. For\nthose from College, all you need to\ndo is to look at the comments from\nstudents on page 9. Just to show you\nhow passionate students that have\nlived/known someone who has lived\nin the halls are about Garden Hall being saved: many of them have put their\nnames to their comments. Also, these\nare not all of the comments that could\nhave been put in. Many were excluded\ndue to space restrictions.\nElections\nElections are well and truly here. Let\u2019s\nhope that it is all done fairly with no\nfunny business. It was a rather bold\nmove to have a Results Party planned\nand advertised. The complaints system this year is a bit odd and definitely made to discourage people\nfrom complaining. To be fair the idea\nis to stop people constantly getting\nin touch with trivial matters. However, it\u2019s a barrier to those who are\ncurrently Union outsiders: they have\nto wade through the dull information to find a code for their complaint.\nWhy not just let them email in and\njust reply to them all? You would get\na lot, but loads of people get a lot of\nemails, you just suck it up. It\u2019s needless bureaucracy. I guess you can say\nyou don\u2019t want someone in a position\nif they aren\u2019t willing to do that, but it\njust seems like a bad system. Plus it\u2019s\nlame as hell coming from a students\u2019\nunion to have alphanumeric coding\nsystems rather than a less formal\nemailing system.\nAnyway, over the next seven days\nyou\u2019ll be accosted time after time by\npeople wanting you to vote for them.\nTry to resist the temptation to just\nimpulse vote for whoever you think\nlooks nicest or gives you the best\nsweets etc. Think really hard about\nit and pick whichever candidate you\nthink is the best for the role.\nCLASSIFIEDS\nVolunteers wanted for experiments investigating balance and perception\nIf you are interested in taking part you must be aged\n18-65 and not suffering from vertigo, dizziness, balance or hearing problems.

He explores fundamental ideas\nand emotions and presents them, bare,\nto the listener. he frequent poise of\nthe melodies on the break of his voice,\nwhich he tightrope walks with captivating purity, reinforces the raw emotion,\nand the gritty insistence implies frus-tration. But the tracks are not doom\nand gloom. Instead the lyrics evoke the\nfeeling of contemplative resolution and\nthis, I think, is what makes Richard\u2019s\nmusic clever. Richard has been singing and song-writing for years and it\nshows. He is at one with his guitar and\nhis newly formed band is already well-integrated, contributing beautifully\nunderstated vocal harmonies, drum\nbeats and bass lines. he rhythm and\nmeandering tempo of Richard\u2019s song\n\u201cShow Me he Way\u201d feels comfortably\nfamiliar and this song, in particular,\nwill resonate. And it is a pleasure to\nbecome familiar with the songs.

Richard could bene\ufb01t from more\nmusical experimentation and variation both within and between songs.\nHowever, with his thirst for musical\ninspiration and continued gigging to\naudiences in Cambridge, Brighton and\nLondon, he is sure to push\nthese boundaries and to\ninspire his audience. I\nstrongly recommend a\nYouTube or SoundCloud\nsearch for the songs released so far and there will\nbe an EP to listen to in the\nspring. He is playing at St\nPancras Old Church on\nthe 4th of April.\nRichard Allen II\nSinger-songwriter\nSivu Progressive Pop\nCourtesy of St Barts Hospital, Sivu recently spent two hours in an MRI scanner recording the video for his \ufb01rst single \u201cBetter Man han He\u201d\n. Fascination\nwith both the song and the movement\nof his tongue as he sings has caused\nYoutube views to\nrocket. And the Sivu\nstorm has continued\nto rage following the\nrelease of the sin-gle. It was recorded\nwith Alt-J producer,\nCharlie Andrews,\nand similarities to\nthe hit band are au-dible, particularly\nin the layering and\nthe vocal percussion in the track.\nhe orchestration\nin Sivu\u2019s music, now\ninvolving various\ncombinations of\nvoice, cello, violin,\nkeys, drums, harp\nand omnichord, creates an ambience\nthat lingers long after \ufb01nal notes. Ingenious use of instruments gives each\nits own stage. Reiterated treble phrases\nare placed perfectly over rolling\nwaves of reverberating chords,\nreminiscent of Wild Beasts, and\nthe melodies are ear-worms that\nstay with you for days. he sound\nis strangely comforting and\ndreamy, no matter what you were\ndoing before listening.

She plays the guitar\nand the accordion and has acquired a drummer, a violinist, a\nbassist(whohasalsoworkedwith\nthe likes of Laura Marling, and\nJames Morrison) and another\nguitarist along the way, as well as\nmany avid supporters. Eva leads\nthe band, headstrong, though\nmysterious songs telling of Greek\nmythology and sea creatures. he texture of the music is like that of treacle\nand the seductive, lilting rhythms are\nsomewhat reminiscent of walking on a\nlarge ship or after one too many glasses\nof wine. Despite the primitive feel, the\nsongs are musically complex, with lyrical violin solos cutting through the\nrippling blanket of harmonies and\nmany almost a cappella moments\nwith which Eva lullabies us into con-templation. In\ufb02uences have been\nplucked from many an apple tree\nacross blues, gypsy and even reg-gae. An EP and a single have been\nreleased and are well worth a listen.\nhe EP was hand printed using a\nwood cut on recycled wallets.\nThe Intermission Project\nFunk/Soul\nCurrently London\u2019s favourite band of 18-year-olds,\nhe Intermission Project\nwas formed when two\nschool friends embarked on\na gap year of music-making whilst they\ndecide what road\nto take in life. Six\nmonths in, they\u2019ve\npaved this road al-ready. On the way\nthey have adopted\nSam, an alternating saxophonist/\ncellist whose smile\nthey spotted at a\ngig, and the resulting composition of\nthe band is delight-ful. Jim Rubaduka,\nthe lead singer, has\nan e\ufb00ortlessly rich and\ncharacterful voice, perfectly\ntuned over every twist and\nlyrics, often both\nempowering and\nregretful, and his\ndistinctive voice is\nperfectly suited to\nthese. He touches\non religion, human nature and\nmental wellbeing,\nbut they are merely suggested and\nso his songs are\nneither depressing\nnor pretentious.\nHis voice is well-enunciated and\nsticks on certain\nwords, but \ufb02oats\nethereally over\nothers. Sivu\u2019s music can be found\non SoundCloud or\nYoutube, \u201cBetter\nMan han He\u201d can\nbe purchased on\nItunes or Spotify,\nand there will be\nan EP out later this\nyear. De\ufb01nitely\none to watch.\nturn. Alex Watson tracks\nthe melody with tight vocal\nharmonies & reinforces the\nbright sound on the banjo\nand mandolin. he sound\nis relatively simple but\nthe melodies ingeniously\nmemorable. Despite their\nyoung age and the band\u2019s\ninfancy, emotions in their\nsongs successfully span joy,\nregret and hope, bringing\na charming youthfulness\nbut also a remarkable maturity wherever appropriate.\nAnd the band blends\ngenres \u2013 the layered\nstring instruments\nand vocal harmonies\nsuggest folk whilst\nthe \ufb02uid saxophone\nsolos and warmth\nin Jim\u2019s voice brings\na welcome dose of\nsoul. he Intermission Project have music on YouTube and\nSoundCloud and are\nrecording an EP at\nthe moment. heir grinning\nenthusiasm is a joy to watch.\n\n"

Her mother Evelyn (Kid-man) is an emotional wreck, only\ncomforted by the mysterious appearance of Charles (Goode), the charm-ing, clean-cut younger brother of her\ndeceased husband. Faced with an\nillusive uncle she never thought she\nhad, India keeps her distance, (as she\noften does with everyone \u2013 at school,\nat home), and keeps a close eye on\nthis man who seems too good to be\ntrue.\nAnd of course, the creepy smiles,\nthe odd looks, the hazy past, the good\nmanners all suggest something is o\ufb00\nand it isn\u2019t long before anyone who\nappears to know more than they let\non starts disappearing; most notably\nhousekeeper Mrs. Garnish (Phyllis\nSomerville) who is startled by his re-turn, and Aunt Gin (Weaver in a brief\nbut sporadically funny turn), who becomes too inquisitive and potentially\nhelpful to India.\nWhat develops is an uncomfort-able, unsettling incestuous love\ntriangle between the three main\ncharacters that constantly keeps everyone on edge. His immediate e\ufb00ect\non the grieving widow is an obvious\none: as evidenced by Kidman\u2019s spot-on transition from the withdrawn\nand depressed, (no-one can do this\nbetter than the pale, slender, blood-shot-eyed Kidman) to the more lively\nand enthusiastic. As Evelyn begins\nto catch onto Charlie\u2019s motives and\nstarts to see India as a potential com-petitor, the cold, icy, steely-eyed side\nkicks in, again, something Kidman\ntruly dominates.\nIt\u2019s also remarkable to see Goode \ufb01nally landing a role he can shine in, as\nhis previous leading e\ufb00orts have been\nduds (Leap Year, Brideshead Revisited). Here is a performance of such\nunique peculiarity and fascination\nthat he brings out much aura of ambiguity in his villainous character. He\ncasually glides through and seduces\nhis way into Evelyn and India\u2019s world,\nalmost hypnotising those around\nhim (including one highly erotically\ncharged piano duet).\nTo further enhance the mystery el-ement, director Park goes all out in\ncreating such a vivid yet constantly\nhaunting series of images and scen-ery, mounting one gothic set-piece\nafter another. he many references\nto classic fairy-tale stories here are\nclearly made, although these aren\u2019t\nthe ones you traditionally hear about\n\u2013 instead with Wentworth Miller\u2019s\ntwisted script and Park\u2019s masterful\ndirection successfully putting even\ndarker turns into the narrative. His\ncameras linger back and forth clev-erly, positioning itself to focus on all\nthe right key moments, which give\nrise to some shockingly gruesome\nmoments.\nPlaced at the centre of it all is\nWasikowska, who has the most challenging role yet of her career, as the\ngirl coming of age, becoming a fully-grown woman, ready to step away\nfrom her childhood con\ufb01nement to\ntake matters into her own hands.\nHer maturation process is essentially\nwhat the \ufb01lm is all about \u2013 as a social\noutcast she sees things others can\u2019t,\nand hears things others cannot \u2013 and\nwith this eccentric, almost supernatural quirk, Wasikowska plays around\nher character, ultimately blossoming\ninto an unlikely heroine with questionable morality.\nAll this, backed by some superb\nmusic composition that perfectly\nconveys the sinister mood, is why\nParker is without a doubt one of the\nbest \ufb01lms of this year so far \u2013 we\u2019re\nonly still in March of 2013, but this\nwill be one that lingers in your mind\nin the most uncomfortable, disturbing way possible \u2013 which is precisely\nwhat Park\u2019s \ufb01lms (Sympathy for Mr.\nVengeance, Oldboy, Sympathy for\nLady Vengeance) are all really aiming for.\nThe Three Performances to watch\nhe Kids Are All Right (2010) Jane Eyre (2011) Albert Nobbs (2011)\n\n"

    "content": "STUDENT TRUSTEES\nBeing a Student Trustee is a serious responsibility which requires those on the\nBoard to take an active role in the governance and direction of the Union. The\nTrustee Board is there to ensure that the Union is meeting its aims and objec-tives, sets the long term strategy, ensures that the Union is using its financial\nresources correctly and is financially viable and ultimately is acting within the\nlaw. They meet about 4-5 a year, have an away day, and have various sub com-mittees. Two student trustees are elected, and two are appointed. So you are\nlooking for two top candidates.\nHello Imperial!\nI\u2019m Bukki, a chemical engineering\ndude running to be one of your trus-tees.\nIt\u2019s common knowledge that the\nprimary people at this uni are the\nstudents. I mean without you, what\nwould Imperial be?\nNot only that, but as top, aspiring students we are the future of this\ncountry and the countries we come\nfrom. We\u2019re the future of this whole\nworld and as such I feel we deserve at\nleast a little comfort for the next few\nyears here before the pressure of leading really tests us when we leave this\nmemorable South Kensington cam-pus.\nI\u2019ve had the pleasure of coming into\ncontact with a ridiculous amount of\nyou and I know that this alone gives\nme the knowledge to really show the\nbig decision makers at Imperial what\nwe, the students, want and need. Increased funding for clubs and socie-ties, halls nowhere near Acton...increased student satisfaction via the big\npockets we know Imperial have.\nAs co-chair of events for the chemical engineering department I\u2019ve had a\nreally, really successful year organising\nand hosting events for the students\nthat have been said by lecturers and\nolder students alike to be the some of\nthe best events of past years. Next year\nI hope to continue this success by providing another service but on a much\nwider scale.\nSo what am I going to do as your\ntrustee?\nEssentially, anything you want...\nMy name is Bukki.\nTrust me to be your trustee.\nBukki Adedapo\nThe union has recently undergone\nsome major changes, managerial,\nstructural and \ufb01nancial. Following\nthese changes it is important that the\nUnion continues to remain focused\non supporting its members (that\u2019s us\nstudents) with our studies, improving our experience of university, and\nproviding support for extra-curricular\ndevelopment. he #AgainstActon\ncampaign is a good example of the\nUnion getting this right \u2013 it is great to\nsee so many people expressing their\nopinions and getting involved with the\nUnion.\nAs a member of the trustee board\nI would work to keep the Union and\nyour representatives accountable and\naccessible; working with the College,\nand supporting the numerous clubs,\nsocieties and projects that make Imperial more than just a place to study.\nI am a second year physicist and in\nmy spare time I help look after Jezebel (the RCS\u2019s Mascot) and help with\nthe technical side of Dramsoc plays\n(as well as lots of other things). I have\nsat on the advisory board of a national\nyouth organisation; been a regional\nrepresentative at national confer-ences; and was a member of the, now\ndefunct, Union Court.\nAs a result of my involvement in a\nnumber of societies (and having been\non various club committees), I have a\ngood working knowledge of the Union, its documentation and goals. I\nfeel that I would make a good Student\nTrustee and that I will be able to help\nwith the on-going work to shape the\nUnion into something that we all can\nfeel an important part of.\nStephen Ball\n1. I am currently a third year reading\nBiochemistry with Management. he\nJoint Honours nature of my course\nwill allow me to represent both the\nLife Science and Business School on\nthe Trustee Board.\n2. I have been actively involved in\nmany clubs and societies during my\ntime at Imperial including Finance,\nHockey, Squash and Biochemistry.\nBeing involved in a diverse range of\nactivities has given me the opportunity to meet a broad range of individuals which has given me a good understanding of what Imperial students\nwant.\n3. Being a Student Trustee also involves examining the Unions accounts,\nyearly budget and annual report. Having undertaken several internships at\n\ufb01nancial institutions as well as undertaking a management course next\nyear, I believe I have the relevant skill\nset to undertake these duties.\n4. I strongly advocate lecture recordings being made freely available to all\nstudents. In addition, I will also strive\nto improve student\u2019s understanding of\nUnion undertakings.\n5. VOTE BOWERS!\nAlexander Bowers\nhe Trustee Board is the highest body\nin the Union, forming its strategic di-rection. It supervises the actions of\nthe sabbatical and senior management\nteam, and makes high-level decision\nwith signi\ufb01cant legal or \ufb01nancial im-plications. For instance, the Board has\nrecently updated the Code of Practice\n(the document that governs our relationship with College) and agreed\nchanges to the Union Constitution after approval by Union Council. hese\ndocuments will be integral to the Union\u2019s operations in the coming years.\nAs Council Chair this year, I have\nbeen a member of the Trustee Board,\nas well as being an observer as Deputy\nPresident (Finance & Services) last\nyear. hrough this time on the Board,\nI have come to know the challenges\nand opportunities the Union faces.\nhis is especially key as the Union \ufb01nally moves towards charity registra-tion, where Trustees will acquire additional responsibility for the Union\u2019s\nsuccess. he Union will need to keep\nabreast and ahead of developments in\nCharing Cross, North Acton and Imperial West, so that we can continue to\nprovide a service to all our members\nas courses and students are moved\naround.\nIf elected as a Student Trustee, I\nwill use the experience gained from\n\ufb01ve years\u2019 involvement in the Union\nto ensure it continues to provide an\nexcellent service for its members. We\nhave recently overcome a di\ufb03cult few\nyears, and with the right supervision,\nwe can continue to make ever-bigger\nstrides to make this a better Union.\nVote Michael for Student Trustee!\nMichael Foster\nMore manifestos for Student Trustees on the next page\n\n"

She began her\ncareer in California where\nshe received her BA. During this time she also studied in an inspirational and architecturally rich city,\nParis.\nErika has a style that you cannot help\nbut admire. Both her technical skill\nand her creative ability to take di\ufb00erent\nperspectives on reality have the power\nto take ones breath away. Her underwater paintings capture the essence\nof the unpredictable and the surreal\nnature with which water can play with\nand distort the body.\nIt was a great privilege to interview\nher and I jumped at the chance to\nask her more about her life as an artist and about the journey that led her\nto where she is now. Although this is\na brief insight into the life of the artist\nErika Craig, I hope that after reading,\nyou are inspired to go and do some art\nyourself.\nPersonally, learning about Erika\u2019s\nworking method and her struggle has\ndriven me to do more of the painting\nwhich I love and which I sometimes\n\ufb01nd di\ufb03cult to practice alongside my\ndegree.\nLauren: What was it like to study in\nParis?\nErika: It was wonderful, being surrounding by old architecture, I\u2019m not\nused to that in America; we went to\nmuseums, studied statues. Often we\nwould do sketching in the gardens and\nthen go back to the studio to continue\npainting.\nL: Was there anything in particular\nthat helped develop your artistic\nstyle during your studies?\nE: I took a \ufb01gure painting class. Having a time limit made me freer with my\ndrawing, I usually spend a lot of time\non portraits but the 30 second pose\nrestriction drew on my impulses and\ngave me con\ufb01dence.\nL: Who is your favourite artist(s)?\nE: I\u2019m inspired by the romanticism\nmovement and renaissance styles and I\nlove surrealism and dream-like scenes.\nL: What were the major turning\npoints in your career as an artist?\nE: In high school I started getting a\npain in my hands and found it increasingly more di\ufb03cult to use them. I had\nsurgery and it was di\ufb03cult not being\nable to do things that I wanted to do,\nespecially art, writing and drawing\nwhich are such a major part of my life.\nAfter I recovered it gave me a renewed\nsense of appreciation for art.\nL: Were there particular people who\ninfluenced you and your art?\nE: he painting teacher I had was also\nmy sur\ufb01ng instructor. he school was\nonly 10 minutes from the beach so we\nhad sur\ufb01ng classes. I found it interesting how painting underwater scenes\nmade me pay more attention to the\nfalling and \ufb02owing water, it gave me a\nkind of hyper-sense watching re\ufb02ections. I feel that nature and art naturally go together.\nL: Can you describe to me the process of how you begin a painting?\nE: First I build a canvas, stretch the\ncanvas over it and then coat it with a\nprimer. I use a projector as my pieces\nare large and it is di\ufb03cult on that scale\nto get the proportions right using free\nhand. I trace the outlines and then I like\nto paint a base coat of acrylic. I use sepia tones and neutral colours. It\u2019s nicer\nto paint with a base coat than on the\nbare canvas. hen I move around the\npainting focusing on di\ufb00erent parts,\nusually starting with the darker areas.\nI paint the basic shapes and from then\non it\u2019s really just intuitive. I enjoy painting the face the most so I usually start\nwith that. I found, from experience,\nthat it is better to work on the canvas as\na whole rather than doing the portrait\nand then the re\ufb02ections afterwards as\nyou can maintain a constant colour\npalate and keep the same colour theme\nthroughout the piece. Otherwise you\nhave to mix up the colours again and\nyou can never get the same tone twice.\nL: Where do you go from there?\nE: Every painting I do is a struggle, at\na certain stage it just looks like an ugly\nmess. But eventually I \ufb01gure it out.\nEach painting is like a journey rather\nthan a method. If you think about it\ntoo much it doesn\u2019t work. My biggest\nfear is starting on a blank white canvas\nand not knowing what to do, focussing\non tiny details and getting caught up in\nthe speci\ufb01cs rather than the painting as\na whole. My advice when painting is to\njust go for it, and come back to the details later, only then does it really come\nto life.\nL: Does art express you as a person?\nE: Yeah, I think so; even if I don\u2019t try\nit expresses parts of me. I look back at\nthings and see the same themes. he\npositions of the \ufb01gures and the type of\nmood conveyed re\ufb02ects how I was feeling at the time.\nLauren Radcliffe interrogates an artist\nE\nEnhanced interrogation techniques\nare not funny\n\n"

    "content": "All good things of this Earth...\nAndrew Ryan fearsthestrengthofthemajorityvote.Shouldyou?\nta\ufb00 and students of Imperial College London, my\nname is Andrew Ryan. No\ndoubt many of you have\nheard of the city built upon\nfree enterprise and thought - my city\nof Rapture.\nI\u2019m writing here, in order to o\ufb00er\nmy services to you - the innovators\nand entrepreneurs of the future. For\ntoo long has the withering grip of governmental greed been wrapped tightly\naround the throat of progress, stunting\nthe growth of our youth. With my help,\nyour minds can envisage a world with\nout boundaries, or petty morality. Is it\nnot your right to live an unsti\ufb02ed life,\nfree to work and dream as you please?\nFor the next few weeks, I will be\navailable to answer any of your questions - philosophical, economic and\nphilanthropic. But today, I would like\nto talk to you about the contagion that\nhas been spreading amongst the student populace over the last few weeks.\nIncurable democracy.\nSo many of you are quick to despise\nthose who place themselves supreme,\nthose who name themselves kings, dic-tators, despots. Now I ask of you - are\nthose men your true enemies? A man\nor woman who places themself on a\npedestal is easy to topple, but what\nabout the mob that surrounds them?\nDemocracy puts the power in the\nhands of the many. he hands of those\nwho are weak. hose who are easily\nswayed. Your colleagues can be part of\nthis majority - your so-called friends\nplotting your downfall.\nIt is not those who are elected, who\ngain most from their time in power - it\nis their allies. he spiders on the web\nthat supports them. he nameless \ufb01gures who pro\ufb01t from the work of oth-ers. he unaccountable shadows who\npull the strings.\nhe voice of the individual is lost\nwithin the unrestricted power of the\nmajority, breeding paranoia like a festering wound. It may at \ufb01rst encourage\ndevelopment and growth but it soon\ndevolves into carnage, with each man\nleft with a choice - to murder and rob,\nor to be robbed and murdered \ufb01rst.\nhe parasite \ufb01nds a welcome host\nwithin the democratic mob.\nWhy should you have these so-called\nelected o\ufb03cials running your union?\nhose whose manifestos may seem\nclear to clouded minds, but was written by hands in the chaos of anonym-ity. You are in the position to out these\npuppets, and reconstruct the way your\nstudent union is built. A new system\nwhere innovation is rewarded, rather\nthan a measure of who has the most\n\u2018friends\u2019.\nMy experience within Rapture has\nproven one thing - cold hard cash turns\nmore heads than notions of greed.\nBuild your way to the top of the tower,\nand protect yourself from your allies.\nYou will never know when the bitches\nof the government will be working to\nundermine your name. Or rather, you\nwill never know if they may stop.\nRapture may not be perfect. Of\ncourse, no society that allows parasites\nto thrive within its walls can ever be.\nhe path to a utopian world is not an\neasy one, nor can the yoke rest on one\nman\u2019s shoulders. Only through the\ncombined e\ufb00orts of every man, can\nour society reach the greatness it de-serves.\nYet, I am no self-proclaimed saviour\nof society. I built Rapture as a home for\nintellect and innovation, safe from the\neyes of any God, or progress-fearing\nmind. I have laid out the plans to let\nyou become the greatest you could\never dream to be. To allow the man\nwith the lesser mind, the weaker con-viction, and yet the greatest number of\nallies, have power over you, is not just\nadmitting defeat. It is spreading the\ndisease.\nAnd so, I cordially invite you all, to\nvisit my stall at the forthcoming Industrialist Fair. here will be places for\nminds like yours, in my city.\nI look forward to your questions over\nthe forthcoming weeks. With warmest\nregards, Andrew Ryan.\nhanks Mr Ryan! If you have any questions for Mr Ryan, please do not hesitate to email felix.games@imperial.\nac.uk with the title \u201cAsk Andrew\u201d, and\nwe\u2019ll pass them along to his people.\nS\nGAMES Games Editor: Ross Webster\ngames.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFRIDAY 08 MARCH\nFrom the pile of simulator games in the\nFelix o\ufb03ce, this week\u2019s random selection is Police Force. From the maker of\nthe hit title Emergency, Police Force sees\nyou patrolling the streets of Germany,\ntowing illegally parked cars, setting up\nspeed traps and arresting vandals. Plus,\nthere\u2019s a gun on the back cover. hat\u2019s\nworth at least 2/10 on it\u2019s own.\nYou play as a pair of cops, with each\none having di\ufb00ering equipment, for\ndi\ufb00erent missions. he controls are a\nlittle odd, but it\u2019s easy to get used to.\nYou\u2019ll be hitting pedestrians and cutting your wages short after a temporary suspension, in no time at all. Now,\nthat\u2019s the thing \u2013 you have a main mission (i.e. do a license registration check\non 35 vehicles), but it\u2019s not over when\nyou\u2019re done. You play each mission for\na set length of time (30 minute realtime shifts) \u2013 once your main mission\nis over, you still have time to answer\nemergency calls and drive to the other\nside of town, to pick up more experi-ence, and rank up. It might seem like a\ncheesy way to force people to continue\nplaying your game, but I like it \u2013 at least\non a \ufb02avourful note \u2013 as a cop doesn\u2019t\ngo home as soon as he\u2019s arrested the\nman responsible for putting up 5 posters around town.\nhere is a range of hi-tech equipment\navailable for you, such as pepper spray,\nhandcu\ufb00s, walkie-talkies and a PDA.\nSimply right click on someone, when\nyour handcu\ufb00s are out, and they\u2019re ar-rested. If someone\u2019s car was totalled in\na collision, get the tow company out\nthere in seconds at the press of a but-ton. Nothing too fancy or complicated\n\u2013 yet it still gives you a nice warm feeling for helping out the society of this\nvirtual German city.\nAs you progress through your mis-sions, more of the city is unlocked, so\nyou have more ground to traverse to\ncatch your troublemakers, bank robbers and ice cream trucks. here seems\nto be nothing in the way of unlockables\n(apart from achievements), so there\u2019s\nlittle to get you experience farming, nor\nmuch in the way of replayability. he\naudio\u2019s simple but entertaining (mainly\nthe sirens on the police car), and the\ngraphics keep it basic too \u2013 low, medium and high, so it\u2019ll work on nearly\nany computer built in this millenium.\nI quite like the game, and might actually keep it installed for a bit, to play\nit on a rainy day. For those of you who\nwant the cutting edge in games, good\nnews! he sequel \u2013 Police Force 2, is out\nin 8 days.\nAnd no, you can\u2019t shoot the civilians.\nI tried. Lots.\nPlaying cops and robbers \u2013 a Police Force review\n56\nRoss Webster The Hamburgler\nAlso from Rapture, we will have\nthe world renowned psychiatrist\nDr. Sophia Lamb joining us, to\nhelp you with any issues you have,\nregarding flatmates, friends, part-ners, and so on. The kind doctor is\nalso a specialist in child psychology\nand can help you with any father\nissues you may be feeling, whilst at\nImperial.\nAny questions for Dr. Lamb can\nalso be sent to felix.games@im-perial.ac.uk, and the replies will\nbe posted here, unless you wish to\nkeep everything confidential.\nAgony Lamb\nHmm. It says \u2018Police\u2019 rather\nthan \u2018Polizei\u2019. Maybe the real\npatrol car\u2019s in the shop...\n\n"

Without these vital\nfeelings, it becomes more and\nmore desolate to start university at\nImperial at age eighteen.\nAlexandra Turner, BSc in Mathematics at Imperial College London, MSc in Medical Statistics at\nthe London School of Hygiene\nand Tropical Medicine, Garden\nHall Resident 2009/2010\nGarden hall gives such a unique\nuniversity experience to those\nlucky enough to live there. The\nbuilding is beautiful and has such\ncharacter, on top of which the setting of Prince\u2019s Gardens, right next\nto Hyde Park and the Albert Hall\nis amazing and the joy of living\nhere shouldn\u2019t be denied to future\nstudents.\nKelvin Wong, Master in Mathematics, University of Cambridge,\nGarden Hall Resident 2009/2010\nGarden Hall is one of the only College owned Halls of Residences\nthat preserves the character of\nthe area in which the University\u2019s\nmain campus is in. The proximity\nof the hall to the main campus actively encourages students to get\ninvolved with extra curricular ac-tivities, which are largely based on\nthe South Kensington campus and\noften run until quite late, I believe\nthat the lack of affordable accommodation close to College would\nbe a huge loss to freshers hoping\nto enjoy the university experience\nand would adversely affect the already embarrassingly low student\nsatisfaction levels.\nKelvin Wong, Master in Mathematics, University of Cambridge,\nGarden Hall Resident 2009/2010\nGarden Hall is the only Imperial hall that possesses real inspirational character! To take it away\nfrom the freshers is probably the\nsingle worst thing Imperial College could do to its students and I\nwould instantly lose respect for the\nuniversity and how it is run if this\nwere to happen. Not only would\nI withdraw my future support of\nthe university I would encourage\nall my friends to do similarly and\nlaunch a campaign to see the university put in better hands.\nAnonymous\nThe university has made too many\ndecisions in recent years without\nfair consultation and accurate reflection of the opinions of its stu-dents. These decisions may have\nmade some economic sense but\nnone of these benefits have found\ntheir way back to the students.\nWith each decision they\u2019ve taken\nmore away than they\u2019ve provided\nand anything they have provided\nhas gone unnoticed or unwanted!\nAnonymous\nIf they continue to damage what\nit means to be an Imperial student\nand move further from student-centric business models they may\nfind themselves with the shiniest,\nfacility-rich, efficient, soul-drain-ing machine in all of London; short\nterm gains will be far outweighed\nby the rapid decline in the percentages of this country\u2019s (and\nothers) sharpest minds that wish\nto attend the university. Imperial\u2019s\nreputation will inevitably similarly\nplummet and those responsible for\nthese decisions will be identified\nand held accountable.\nAnonymous\nI strongly encourage relevant individuals to reflect on these views\nand those of other students past\nand present, the university\u2019s future,\nand their reasons for working in\nthis sector before potentially making one of the most disappointing\nmistakes of their career.\nSean Lucent was in Garden and\nWeeks 2009 - 2012, Weeks for\nthe first two of those years and\nGarden for his final year because\nhe had spent so much of his time\nthere the year before.\nI wasn\u2019t in Garden (or Weeks) for\nmy first year (though Garden was\nthe hall I was hoping to be assigned to) and I saw almost all the\nhalls of residence in my first year\nfirsthand - Garden was the only\nhall that felt like a home to me and\nnot a hotel and I loved being part\nof the Garden and Weeks community so much I never once considered anywhere else.\nIt\u2019s not just the people (great\npeople are to be found in all of Imperial\u2019s halls), it\u2019s the way Garden\nand Weeks in particular provide\nan environment that encourages\nits residents to get together. Garden is pretty maze-like in its layout\nand that\u2019s brilliant; you get used to\nit pretty quickly and it breaks from\nthe clear divisions of sectioned\nfloors that you get with other halls.\nI feel I had more opportunity to\nmeet and talk to everyone in that\nhall than I would have done in any\nof the others.\nIsaac Gentle, 3rd year Imperial\nCollege student, Garden Hall Resident 2010/2011\nI would not have come to imperial,\nif it weren\u2019t for the double and triple rooms (which are affordable)\nof halls like garden. Current plans\nare not a replacement of garden.\nThey are a catering for a richer\nmarket alienating the poor. Yet\nagain, this just serves to reinforce\nthe importance of money to the\ncollege over people.\nAbigail Laverack\nI am a resident at Fisher Hall and I\nresent the proposals to price people like me out of Imperial College\nLondon.\nJane Courtnell, 1st year Biology\nstudent at Imperial College, Garden Hall Resident 2012/2013\nGarden Halls is cheap accommodation that is close to campus, and\ntherefore its closure will have a\ngreater impact on poorer students.\nVictoria Walshaw\nIf Imperial really cared about improving it\u2019s student satisfaction\nlevels, they shouldn\u2019t be sending fresher students even further\naway.\nCeline Tang, 3rd year Imperial\nCollege student, Garden resident\n2010/2011 and 2012/2013\nGarden is just an amazing halls\nthat is close to imperial, cheap and\nhas such a friendly close knit com-munity. It would have such a huge\nimpact on first year students to\nclose this halls.\nAnran Cheng, 1st year Imperial\nCollege student, Garden resident\n2012/2013\nI just love Garden! It is the best\nplace I could imagine for students.\nWardens and students living here\nare just like a big family. It is super-close to the uni and therefore provides excellent opportunities for us\nto participate in different activi-ties. It is just so important for fresh-ers! They would definitely lose a lot\nif the hall is closed!\nKaty Sayer, 1st year\nIf cheap, close rooms hadn\u2019t been\navailable at Imperial I would have\nhad to go elsewhere. Garden and\nWeeks is a really close-knit, friendly and diverse community; to close\nGarden would close a wide range\nof opportunities for a lot of peo-ple, meaning less well-off students\ncould end up spending all their\ntime travelling, having less time to\nstudy and take part in extra-cur-ricular activities than those in Eastside and Southside. Save Garden!\nKristel Fobelets\nI believe we have to support our\nstudents who are coming from a\nless well-off backgrounds. Paying\nback a heafty student loan is not a\nhealthly start to a young person\u2019s\ncareer.\nEleanor Jay\nAs a Sub-Warden of Garden hall\nfor 4 years (2008-12), I can affirm\nthat the hall, although needing\nsome rennovations, is a vibrant\nand well loved place. Unlike many\nof its contemporaries, Garden hall\noffers rooms which are affordable\nto those who simply cannot afford\nto pay the extortionate rents of\nother residences; these frequently\nexceed the student loan.\nClearly a range of housing <\u00a3100\npw is in need at Imperial and without Garden this will be lost and a\ngeneration of bright, aspiring students will be unable to learn and\ndevelop themselves at Imperial\nCollege London.\nKhoonsake Segkhoonthod\nOne of the roles of the university is\nto provide freshers with affordable\naccommodation close to college,\nand closing garden hall is yet another step away from this for Imperial. Keep Garden open!\nIvan Brown\nFrom what I have gathered from\nthose living in Paragon and Xenia\nhalls, they find it a lot more inconvenient to socialize with others\nfrom their course. Garden Halls\nare conveniently placed, and Acton less so.\nAndrei Cioara\nStudent life is busy anyway. When\nyou pay more to travel more, there\nis surely something wrong going\non. Everyone envies Garden Hall\nresidents for good reason.\nAngus Bayley\n[I signed the petition] Because I\u2019m\nworried that the college may be\npricing the less privileged out of\ntheir first choice education.\nMaksymilian Wi\u015bniowski\nIn two years I would like to apply\nto Imperial College (Biochemisry).\nOne of the main reasons I wanted\nto do so was the low cost of acco-modationinGardenHall.Ithought\nthat Garden Hall was going to be\nthe place where I could place my\nfirst steps in the \u201cnew world\u201d - London :) . I need you Garden Hall !\nCeline Tang\nI have lived in Garden for 2 years\nof my time at Imperial.

The size\nof the rooms, historic architec-ture, proximity to the college and\nprice made it an ideal hall of residence to live in. It is saddening to\nhear that G&W will potentially\nbe closed.

    "content": "MUSIC\nMusic Editors: Mark England,\nRoss Gray, Simon Hunter\nmusic.felix@gmail.com\n49\nFRIDAY 08 FEBRUARY\nAMS album of the week\nYouth Lagoon consists of a single 23 year old\nman: Trevor Powers. His debut, The Year of Hibernation, was released back in 2011 and still\nstands as by far my favourite album to emerge\nfrom the stampede of lo-fi singer songwriters\nof recent years. Rarely going beyond a minimalist combination of reverb drenched key-boards, processed beats and dreamy vocals\nit was a haunting, beautiful, perfectly formed\nslice of dream pop. Wondrous Bughouse is a\nfar more complicated beast. Here you\u2019ll find\nlayers, textures and a wide variety of influ-ences. It\u2019s an exciting development and makes for a fascinating listen.\n\u2018Through Mind and Back\u2019 is a great little intro that showcases the variety of\ntechniques and sounds that is the rest of the album. Next up is \u2018Mute\u2019. \u2018Mute\u2019 is\nunbelievable. Layers and layers of synths create an incredible dreamy textured\nsoundscape of pure wonderment. It\u2019s definitely my track of the year so far. The\nrest obviously can\u2019t quite live up to the greatness of \u2018Mute\u2019 (I could probably\ntalk about how good this track is for the remainder of this review...) but there\nare some other fantastic tracks. \u2018Pelican Man\u2019 draws heavily on 60s psychedelic\nrock but feels more like an update than homage. Shoegaze indebted \u2018The Bath\u2018\nis a swirling vortex of sound set to sparse drums and it\u2019s great. \u2018Dropla\u2019 is much\ncheerier than I\u2019m used to hearing from Youth Lagoon, and is an exciting diversion halfway through the record. In fact, pretty much all of the tracks here are\nof a really high standard. I often find that heavily textured psychedelic stuff gets\na bit dreary, but here only \u2018Sleep Paralysis\u2019 has me considering the skip button.\nPowers has obviously tried to steer his sound away from the minimalist dream\npop that he made his own on his debut, which is understandable, even admira-ble. Sadly, as a result, Wondrous Bughouse feels a lot less like his. There are several tracks here that sound a little bit too much like popular alternative bands.\nYou\u2019llhearAnimal Collective,Tame Impala,Grizzly Bearetc.Itfeelsalittlelike\nhe\u2019s trying his hand at various band\u2019s sounds to see which one he likes the best.\nThat said, his fantastic songwriting still draws this through as a great album, so\nwhilst I might recommend The Year of Hibernation a little more enthusiastically,\nI\u2019d still say this is one you should definitely have on your shopping list. Also,\nlisten to \u2018Mute\u2019, it\u2019s incredible.\nYouth Lagoon: WondrousBughouse\nKeir Little\nhead of the Hacker Farm\nexclusive on IC Radio\nnext week, I spoke to\nthem about their in\ufb02uences, motivations and\nwhat\u2019s coming up next. Kek W ably\nwalked me through the HF ethos.\nPunk Bucket\nWe\u2019ve all known one another since the\nPunk Era \u2013 we grew up during that pe-riod, so Punk as well as Glam, Space\nRock and Psych etc. have informed\nour sensibilities in a big way, as well\nas early UK Industrial and, much later\non, early Acid House and Techno....\nI think we both like that point \u2013\nprobably around the Late 70s \u2013 where\nthe energy of Punk segued into electronic music, so you get tracks where\nguitar-based Punk and Garage bands\nstarted using homemade electronics or cheap/kit synths... and you end\nup with these odd, cool little hybrid\ntracks that still sound pretty amazing today, probably because the bands\ndidn\u2019t actually know what they were\ndoing or they didn\u2019t have the budget\nor studio-time to over-think it or \u2013\nequally important \u2013 because, at that\npoint, there were no rules... the music hadn\u2019t solidi\ufb01ed into rigid, formu-larised genres yet. But you also have\nthe \ufb01rst singles by more electronics-orientated groups / artists like he\nNormal, Robert Rental, Cabaret\nVoltaire, Vice Versa etc... it was an\nexciting and very inspirational time\nto have lived through. But, having\nsaid that \u2013 and as much as we love the\nopen-ended energy of those artists \u2013\nwe\u2019ve no real interest in re-enacting\nthat era; we try as hard as we can to\nsound like us (laughs)...\nKonrad\nYes, the title Konrad is a reference\nRootsofHackerFarm\nRiaz Agahi harvestsinfoaheadofanICRadioexclusive\nto Cluster / Kluster. It was a nod to\nthe late, great Conrad Schnitzler,\nwho set up the Zodiak Arts Lab and\nwas a founding member of Tangerine\nDream in their crazed, early freak-out\ndays when they were as much in\ufb02uenced by Hendrix as the possibilities\na\ufb00orded by electronic experimenta-tion. And some of the early Cluster\nsides are pretty harsh too... Cluster \u201871\n(recorded after he left) is really noisy\nand aggressive; you could play it next\nto something by hrobbing Gristle,\nbut it predates it by about 6 years....\nit\u2019s a misconception that Hippy electronic music is all passive, docile and\ngutless... some of it is very much in yer\nface (laughs); Germany was a hot bed\nof radical politics, music and art in the\nlate 60s and early 70s, and Conrad was\nat the heart of that scene. He never\nstopped experimenting, was way\nahead of the curve. He made tracks in\nthe 70s that Richard James would kill\nto have made. Timeless stu\ufb00.\nEngine Room\nKek: \u2026here has never, hand on heart,\never been any sort of plan whatsoever\nwith any of this (laughs) - nothing beyond an initial chat over a couple pints\nwhere we decided that \u201cmaybe we\nshould do something at some point\u201d.\n\u201cSomething noisy.\u201d (laughs) Because\nwe\u2019ve all known each other so long,\nthings just, sort of, fell into place of\ntheir own accord.\nBecause, it really has been that loose\nand unchoreographed, and it was primarily always about doing something\nfun and \u2018social\u2019 - I\u2019d have to say that\nthe real driver of it all was just the\nact of, you know... doing something.\nhat\u2019s going to sound pretty glib and\n\ufb02imsy, I know (laughs)... but I think\nthat sits at the core of it all: that we\nwanted to do something - something\nvague and noisy and mischievous and\nA\nindeterminate - and if we just said we\nwere forming a band that would cover\nit broadly enough that no one - especially our wives - would ask too many\nquestions (laughs).\n\u2026he actual physical \u2018in-the-zone\u2019\nplaying together as a two- or three-piece is at the core of it all. It\u2019s joyous.\nIt\u2019s a sel\ufb01sh thing, I know, but - let\u2019s be\nhonest: we\u2019re a niche act - there\u2019s no\nmoney in this game - so you have to\nenjoy it for all the right personal rea-sons. It has to be fun or give you some\nsense of personal growth - which this\nde\ufb01nitely is / does. Any \u2018politics\u2019 probably grow logically out of all that - and\nalso, naturally, from the sense of moral\noutrage we feel when we see the way\nthis country is being sold o\ufb00 - and\nout - from within. Our musical and\nphilosophical stance is oppositional,\nof course; we\u2019re angry and annoyed...\nbut we\u2019re also very positive and \ufb01redup about what we do.\n\u2026, I hope that people do \ufb01nd a subversive element in what we do, or that\nit gives them ideas of their own - ways\nthat they themselves can either \u2018\ufb01ght\nback\u2019 or enrich their own lives. People are content to be passive consumers these days; they consume objects\nand information without particularly\nquestioning it. We like to disrupt that\ncycle, we introduce questions or observations into the mix, plant little\nseeds in people\u2019s minds... that\u2019s part of\nwhat we do, but there has to be some\npersonal fun and satisfaction at the\ncore of it all.\nQ.U.B.E\nWe\u2019ve just released a Rubik\u2019s Cube\nmade of QR-Codes that lead you to\npages of audio, video and text content.\nhat\u2019s a really cool little project that\nwe started almost a year ago \u2013 a way of\nmaking digital downloads \u2018interesting\u2019\nby creating a physical object that you\nhave to engage with and which unlocks\ncontent, rather than just pressing a button and getting a kneejerk download\n\u2018freebie\u2019 \u2013 we wanted to make people\nthink about the process and engage\nwith it, form a bridge between the\nanalogue and digital worlds.

    "content": "n 3 March at\n23:59 nominations for this\nyear\u2019s Big Elections closed.\nhese are the elections for a\nlarge number of positions at\nImperial College Union. All of\nthe Sabbatical positions will be\nelected by the student body of\nImperial, with the Union hoping to beat last year\u2019s record\nturnout. All of the manifestos for the candidates can be\nfound from page 13 onwards,\nor online at imperialcollege-union.org/elections. Imperial students must then submit\nvotes ranking their preference\nfor each candidate with a single transferrable vote system.\nhere is also the option to vote\nfor RON, which stands for ReOpen Nominations. If RON\nwins the election is re-run.\nCandidates had to submit\ntheir 250 word manifestos on-line. By the time of publication,\nthey will have been campaigning for nearly a whole working\nweek, with voting opening on\nFriday 8 March at 12:00. On\nhursday 7 March, the candidates took part in hustings.\nhis was in the form of a live\nSTOIC broadcast called \u201cMeet\nthe Candidates\u201d, which is now\navailable on the Union\u2019s Elections website. his did have\nsome technical di\ufb03culties at\nthe start, and had some issues with lagging all the way\nthroughout. Voting will close\non 15 March at 12:00, with\nthe results being announced\nin Metric that night for the\nResults Party. Allowing candidates to celebrate or drown\nsorrows. his means that next\nweek will be when campaigning is, in all likelihood, taken\nup a notch. hroughout the\nelection process, the Union\nwill be blogging the election.\nhis involves updating with\nphotos and tweets of candi-dates.\nhe Union has revamped the\nlook of the promotional material and has the live stats website up once more. his will be\nshowing voting stats from the\nmoment voting opens.\nhis year has seen some\nchanges in the rules. To stand\nfor a position, regardless of\nthe position, there was only\none seconder required. he\nBig Elections website however made some believe that\n20 seconders were needed\nfor the Sabbatical positions.\nhis was due to the code that\nshowed the capping not being\nchanged. Another change was\nthat the Returning O\ufb03cer for\nthe Elections is an external,\nwhich is standard practice at\nmost other unions. Although\nthe Deputy Returning O\ufb03cers\nare sta\ufb00 members at the Union. hey have said that they\nare interested in the democratic legitimacy of the Union.\nCandidates no longer have to\nsubmit their campaign material to the Returning O\ufb03cer for\napproval. Instead it is a system\nwhereby people put out there\nmaterial and can then get into\ntrouble for it at a later time.\nhe complaints procedure\nhas also been changed from\nlast year. his year, only complaints submitted via an online form can be upheld. his\nform requires complainants to\n\ufb01nd the relevant code for their\ncomplaint.\nIn the Initial Candidates\nMeeting, the Returning Of\ufb01cer, reminded everyone of\nthe importance of good cam-paigning. He said: \u201chis is an\nelection not a selection\u201d.\nAs with every year, this year\nthe election has already had\nsomething in the way of con-troversy. here is one candi-date, Forhad Matin, who is\nstanding for every single position available to him, although\nhe has only submitted a manifesto for Union President,\nRCSU President and Chemsoc\nPresident, and he has not submitted a photo for any role.\nOne candidate for Union\nPresident, Christopher Kaye,\nhad a complaint lodged against\nhim because of the poster he\nused. he complaint was regarding the language used. he\nposter said his main manifesto\npoints of selling cigarettes at\nthe Union and putting a photo\nof the Queen behind the bar in\nsmaller writing with \u201cFags at\nthe Union\u201d, \u201cQueen at the Union\u201d, and \u201cNot a prat\u201d in larger\nwriting (see below). he message from the Returning O\ufb03cers, which was a formal warn-ing, stated: \u201cYour poster\u2026\ncontains o\ufb00ensive language\n(\u201cfags\u201d, \u201cprat\u201d and, in this con-text, \u201cqueen\u201d). he candidates\u2019\npack and publicity policy\nclearly state that \u201call campaign\nmaterial must not contain offensive language, contain implied o\ufb00ensive language, or be\nlibelous in nature\u201d.\u201d It then said:\n\u201cPlease remove any physical\nand online publicity with this\nlanguage immediately.\u201d Chris\nKaye rejected the complaint\nsaying: \u201che language used is\nnot o\ufb00ensive in context.\u201d He\nsaid that \u201cfag\u201d was referencing\ncigarettes and that \u201cQueen\u201d\nreferenced the Queen, saying\n\u201cI am Chair of History Society and, in my opinion, the\ninvolvement of the Monarchy\nin the College\u2019s history is very\nimportant. If I cannot refer\nto the \u2018Queen\u2019 then my ability\nto express myself is severely\nrestricted\u201d. He said that the\nword prat is \u201cinformal and not\no\ufb00ensive according to [the]\nCambridge Dictionary\u201d He\nsays he modi\ufb01ed his posters,\nand that the Returning O\ufb03cers never replied to him. He\nhas since withdrawn from the\nelection, giving his primary\nreason as the amount of work\nhe has to do. He added: \u201cI\u2019m\njust dispondant with the whole\nthing, and don\u2019t want things\nto turn as nasty as things did\nwith Abdul last year.\u201d When\nasked about the posters he\nsaid: \u201cIt might\u2019ve been better\nhad I been given the bene\ufb01t\nof the doubt and allowed to\nkeep my poster as it was, and\nlet democracy run its course.\u201d\nhere were allegations that\nKaye\u2019s posters were being torn\ndown, with a report from one\nof Felix\u2019s Comment Editors\nthat he saw someone rip down\na poster, and that two posters\ndisappeared within minutes\nof him walking past the same\nspot. Kaye later satirized the\nwhole campaigning process\nwith a Facebook group \u201cChris\nKaye for \ufb01nishing his computational labs\u201d.\nFor President, there are\nnow three candidates left\nwith manifestos and pictures,\nand one with a manifesto\nonly. he other candidates\ndid not submit a picture or\nmanifesto.\nhere was also a glitch in\nthe system of the online\nmanifestos. One\ncandidate for\nD e p u t y\nP r e s i -d e n t\n(Clubs & Societies) had a manifesto that was over 400 words\nlong. his problem was \ufb01xed\nthe next day.\nAs well as that, there have\nbeen the usual people posting\nin pre-existing groups. Plus\nseveral candidates wanted to\nedit manifestos as well as one\ncandidate wanting to have\ntheir manifesto put up, as they\nmissed the deadline. It was\nruled that everyone had the\nsame restrictions and that nobody can edit or put up manifestos now.\nhe position of Deputy President (Education) has only two\ncandidates facing o\ufb00 against\nRON, with one not submitting a photo or manifesto.\nhe same goes for Deputy\nPresident (Finance &\nServices), with one\ncandidate with-drawing.\nWith everything set in\nplace, the elections are now\nwell and truly\nunderway.\nO\nThe Big Elections 2013: the race is on\nImperial has erupted with flyers, posters, sweets, and lecture speeches, Tim\nArbabzadah reports on the latest goings on as election campaigning kicks off\nDiddy hasn\u2019t been involved in the\nElections... yet.

    "content": "FOOD\n43\nFRIDAY 08 MARCH\nFood Editors: Carol Ann Cheah,\nSophia Goldberg, Yiango\nMavrocostanti\nfood.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nare I say it, but this is\nthe penultimate issue of\nFelix this term \u2013 which\nmeans only one thing:\nexam season is looming.\nDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019m not saying you need\nto start revising just yet, the \u201cholidays\u201d (AKA \ufb01ve weeks of cramming)\nare still a couple of weeks away. Just\nkeep in mind that however hard you\nrevise, it doesn\u2019t need to be all doom\nand gloom, because there\u2019s always a\ngreat meal to look forward to. hank-fully, lunch and dinner create some of\nthose rare sought-after revision breaks\nfrom work we students are so grateful\nfor \u2013 so it\u2019s really important to make\nthe most of them.\nYou\u2019re less likely to be as active as\nyou normally are during revision (I\u2019d\nstill advise you to leave the house on a\ndaily basis), so eating well is really im-portant. As you\u2019ll be going out late less,\nyou\u2019ll be spending a lot less, but don\u2019t\nsave it \u2013 money\u2019s there to be spent,\nright? During revision I splash out on\nreally good quality food. It\u2019s feel-good\nand it may even improve my concen-tration. Uh huh, I\u2019m talking about buying grapes, blueberries and mangos.\nYeah, mangos. I\u2019m happy to buy into\nthe superfood placebo malarkey if it\nkeeps me concentrated.\nBreakfast is the most important meal\nof the day so stick to something that\nwill keep you going, and even better\nif it\u2019s really quick to microwave. Porridge always gets me through to lunch\nwithout any distracting mid-morning\ngrumbles. I love fruits like bananas\nand berries in my porridge. To sweeten add honey or muscovado sugar. For\nbreakfast, buy some freshly squeezed\norange juice, or make it yourself \u2013 the\nvitamin C is good for your immune\nsystem and helps ward o\ufb00 those un-friendly, unwanted revision colds. Alternatively, try one of Josie\u2019s or Alex\u2019s\nsmoothies. Why not treat yourself, and\ngo out for breakfast? It\u2019s a great way to\nstart the day.\nOkay, so snacking can have an adverse e\ufb00ect on your revision, and I\u2019m\nnot advocating procrastination, but\neveryone needs a little revision break\nto keep themselves focused. My top\n\ufb01ve healthy (*coughs* procrastination)\nsnacks are: soft dried apricots, pumpkin seeds, pralines, blueberries and red\ngrapes. I\u2019m told that sugar snap peas\nare also great to nibble on. If you want\na bigger snack, carrots and hummus\nor olives can do the trick. hey\u2019re a favourite of mine, but they can be pretty\nmessy. For something sweet or sa-voury, get some popcorn. We\u2019re going\nthrough a popcorn era at the moment:\nyou can get anything from sweet chilli\nto sticky to\ufb00ee pudding \ufb02avour \u2013 I like\nthe Tyrrells ones best. For a longer revision break, why not make your own?\nIf you feel like splashing out, you\ncould get some Graze boxes delivered\nto your house. hey\u2019re the perfect\nsnack size to take out if you\u2019re popping\nout to the Library or having a revision\nbreak. hey\u2019re not the most economical of buys, but they regularly do deals\nso that your \ufb01rst box is free and your\nsecond is half price.\nFor a treat get some chocolate/ yoghurt covered nuts/dried fruit. hey\u2019re\ngreat for a cheeky snack and you can\nHealthy Procrastination\nSophia Goldberg on why snacking isn\u2019t so bad for you\nD\nOde to Smoothies\nJosieBowler&AlexGray Writers\nDeciding to spend your own personal\nmoney on kitchen appliances rather\nthan clothes/drinks is a pretty signi\ufb01cant sign that you have grown up \u2013 although it may be scary, in the case of\na smoothie maker it is a worthwhile\ninvestment.\nhe \ufb01rst and only rule of smoothie\nmaking is: do not be afraid of your\nsmoothie! he absolute worst case\nscenario (assuming no unknown allergic reactions) is that it tastes bad,\nin which case you can just down it\n(think of the money wasted if you left\nit and to be fair you\u2019ve probably drunk\nworse tasting things on a night out)\nor be a total pansy and throw it away.\nSmoothies are also the most e\ufb03cient\nway of getting from 0 to 5 of your 5 a\nday in the time it takes to drink a pint.\nDo not be afraid of vegetables in\nsmoothies: have no fear combining\nthe fruit with the vegetable. My personal favourite smoothie is spinach,\nbanana and milk (it looks radioactive\nwhich is cool). Bananas are the absolute staple of all smoothies and give\nthe correct texture. You can either use\nwater, milk or natural yoghurt to reach\nthe desired consistency depending on\nhow you feel about calories. Other\npotentially uncommon ingredients include celery, courgette or kiwi.\nFrozen berries are also amazing\nin smoothies and you can put them\nstraight in the blender which sort of\nmakes it a bit icy. If you combine it\nwith water it\u2019s sort of like a slush puppy (delish). hey are also a good deal\ncheaper than buying the room temperature alternative.\nPictured is the smoothie my gorgeous housemate Alex makes every\nmorning. It consists of frozen berries,\nbanana, oats and milk (yes he has labelled his bananas\u2026). Adding golden\nsyrup or honey can be used to sweeten\na smoothie \u2013 a technique Alex seriously advocates \u2013 or lemon/lime juice\ncan be used for the reverse e\ufb00ect.\nCocoa powder also works well; I\u2019ve\nheard the combination of nuts, cocoa\npowder and bananas is very \ufb01lling and\ntastes amazing (I can\u2019t provide \ufb01rst\nhand evidence as I\u2019m allergic to nuts).\nNuts in smoothies are an excellent\nway of adding extra protein: having\na nut based smoothie to accompany\nyour meal will rack up quite a few extra grams of protein.\nPotential things to avoid include\ncottage cheese (I put this in once to try\nand add more calories to my smoothie\nand it was horrendous) and word on\nthe street is grapes are not great either.\nIt\u2019s very hard to go wrong, and if it\u2019s\nnot good then don\u2019t make it again. It\u2019s\nso simple! Why not try it yourself? Get\nexperimenting and get healthy!\nalmost believe that they\u2019re good for\nyou. Try and resist constantly eating Mini Eggs, although they\u2019ll give\nyou a sugar high the sugar low won\u2019t\nhelp you focus. Instead of devouring a\nwhole bag of freshly baked raisin and\noat Sainsbury\u2019s biscuits, share them\nwith your housemates. It gives you\nan excuse to take a break and it tastes\ngood too.\nMauritian Night\nCelebrate Mauritius\u2019 45th independence anniversary with the Imperial College London Mauritian Society!

    "content": "MUSIC\nMusic Editors: Mark England,\nRoss Gray, Simon Hunter\nmusic.felix@gmail.com\nFRIDAY 08 FEBRUARY\n50\nrior to last Friday it\u2019d\nbeen a good year since\nI was last at XOYO.\nIn 2010, when it \ufb01rst\nopened, the initial\nexcitement was of a club with the\nline-ups and support that could have\nproved a replacement for he End.\nHowever something just wasn\u2019t right\nabout the lay-out and the sweat-drip-ping ceiling combined with lineups deviating\nfrom my tastes\nmeant that I only\nended up going\nabout \ufb01ve times.\nBut the potential\nfor the night held\nlast Friday was\nso great I\u2019d have\nprobably gone\nhad it been held\nin the Great Hall.\nProbably.\nDeviation is\na night that sorely underrated DJ,\nBenji B, started \ufb01ve years ago to break\nup the monotony of working for \ufb01ve\nstraight days. Held on a Wednesday,\nits crowd had to be loyal and serious\nabout their music; getting the likes of\nDam Funk, Jackmaster, Mala, heo\nParrish and Joy O to grace the Commercial Street arches on a Wednesday\nnight is no mean feat. But Benji B is\nno amateur; starting his career at KISS\nFM before moving to Radio 1Xtra to\nhost his own show a decade ago, the\nLondon DJ has been a great promoter\nof all things experimental yet soulful\nin electronic music. From introducing\nDeviationlandsatXOYO\nSimon Hunter checksoutanewresidencyfortheparty\nthe UK to Flying Lotus to exposing\nthe world to the UK\u2019s underground\nscene, Benji B has never been part of\nany real clique, rather preferring to do\nthings his way.\nhis year Deviation has moved from\nits midweek enclave to prime-time\nFriday night at one of London\u2019s biggest\nclubs, XOYO. Last Friday was the second of the new residency for the club\nnight, boasting a\nline-up that was\nindicative of the\nserious talents\nthat have been\nbooked for the\nclub night over\nthe next few\nmonths. Employing none\nless than Actress and Jamie\nXX to bring the\nparty, I was convinced that I\u2019d\n\ufb01nd my missing\nlove for the club that night.\nAs we entered, Actress was preparing to take to the decks. Expecting a\ndeep and twisted set of spaced-out\ntechno, we were ready to \ufb02y. Unfortunately the di\ufb00erence between the\nmusic Actress makes and what he\nDJs is quite stark and after taking an\nunexpected R&B hit, we headed for a\nsmoke. It\u2019s not that the guy can\u2019t DJ,\nor even that I disliked the music he\nplayed \u2013 far from it \u2013 it just felt out of\nplace coming from a guy that makes\nsome of the freshest sounding electronic music in the UK today.\nFollowing Actress was Jamie XX\nP\nwho had been given a substantial\nset in comparison to his precursor.\nJust like Actress, Jamie XX is a producer \ufb01rst and DJ second, and this is\nperhaps what let the night down. As\never Jamie\u2019s selection was faultless,\nyet he still hasn\u2019t managed to iron\nout the clashing mixes that have put\na dampener on many of his sets for\nme (although admittedly he seemed\nto nail more of the mixes as his set\nprogressed). As the night ticked\ncloser to and past 3am (the criminally early closing time for the club)\npeople started to trickle out, yet at\naround half past Benji B returned to\nthe decks to play one almighty \ufb01nale.\nSome call it lazy DJ-ing, but really it\nwas genuinely the most fun I\u2019ve had in\na club in months; tunes from Kendrick Lamar, Joy O and TNGHT were\njust a few of the \u2018best of 2012\u2019 \ufb01nale\nthat we were treated to. And the icing on the cake? As the lights came on\nand people started \ufb01ling out, a request\nfrom the booth was shouted down to\nthe \ufb02oor, \u201cTechno or Disco?\u201d. A unanimous swell of \u201cDisco\u201d emanated from\nthe crowd before \u2018Stand On he Word\u2019\nby he Joubert Singers swept across\nthe dance\ufb02oor to close Deviation for\nanother month.\nSo while XOYO still failed to win me\nround, the quality of the music and of\nthe crowd meant that I\u2019ll be spending\nmore Friday evenings sweating and\ndancing in that club just o\ufb00 the Old\nStreet roundabout.\nFriday\n08:00 \u2013 10:00 IC Breakfast\nTop banter, great features and an\neclectic mix of tunes - a must-listen\nwhile you get ready for an action-packed day.\n16:00 \u2013 17:00 he Ornithological\nHour\n18:00 \u2013 19:00 Rock and Roll Ain\u2019t\nNoise Pollution\n20:00 \u2013 21:00 Mad Craic\nAward-winning Mad Craic features\ntunes and banter from the wonderfully English Craig Woods and the\nastonishingly Irish Aislinn Hayes.\n22:00 \u2013 23:00 he Audio Express\nSaturday\n13:00 \u2013 14:00 he Morning After\nChill\nSunday\n15:00 \u2013 17:00 he National Student\nRadio Chart Show\nhe chart show by students across the\nUK with unsigned and chart music -Hosted by a di\ufb00erent student station\nevery week!\n17:00 \u2013 18:00 he Happy Hour\nJoin the Sunday fun with Happy Michael\u2019s random cool features and stories with awesome tunes (and sometimes a complimentary laughing \ufb01t!)\nMonday\n16:00 \u2013 17:00 Monday Matter\n18:00 \u2013 19:00 Honey and Vinegar\nPlaying the best of the latest indie\npop and hip-hop (with the occasional\ncheeky mashup).\n19:00 \u2013 20:00 IC Sessions\nhe amazingly talented Virgin Soldiers join us for an exclusive live session and interview from the IC Radio\nproduction studios.\n20:00 \u2013 21:00 he Eclectic Ectoplasm\nAn eclectic mix of anything and eve-rything. he best music on ICRadio\nevery Monday evening.\nTuesday\n18:00 \u2013 19:00 You Can\u2019t Play hat\nOn Radio Anymore!\nFeaturing psychedelic/progressive\nmusic from the analogue age.\n20:00 \u2013 21:00 Best Foot Forward\nA weekly \ufb01x of brand new indie/alt/\nelectronica\n21:00 \u2013 22:00 Bangin\u2019 Tunes on the\nMost Awesomest Show in the Entire\nUniverse\n23:00 \u2013 00:00 Beneath the Paving\nStones, the Beach\nWednesday\n10:00 \u2013 11:00 AKA\n19:00 \u2013 21:30 Varsity 2013 LIVE\nfrom he Stoop\nLive broadcast and commentary of\nJPR Williams Cup Rugby match 2013\nLISTINGS\nTo listen, go to\nhttp://www.icradio.com/\nand just hit \u201clisten live\u201d\n\n"

    "content": "Julian Assange in Sweden\nChristopher Reynolds reviews a biased and inaccurate account\nof the WikiLeaks founder\u2019s troubles with the law\nne e\ufb00ect of digital distribution is that books\nbecome that would previously be unreleasable\nbecome available. his is\nnot necessarily a bad thing, as books\nwith potential audiences too low to\njustify a print run can now reach their\ntarget market. Julian Assange in Sweden however, is less a book, and more\nof an assemblage of internet message\nboard rantings. Literally so, as much\nof the book is given over to conspiracy theories which are noted as being\nproposed on a Swedish internet forum\n(the logo of which features a cat smoking a spli\ufb00, which tells you all you need\nto know).\nhe book is ostensibly an attempt to\nascertain the facts behind Julian Assange\u2019s visit to Sweden, during which\ntwo women accused him of sexual as-sault. Still facing extradition, Assange\nremains in the Ecuadorean embassy\nnext to Harrods. Although William\nHague, who has not yet come across\na situation he couldn\u2019t make worse,\ninitially threatened to breach the em-bassy, the threat was quickly with-drawn, presumably after someone had\ninformed Hague of international law,\nand the situation has since remained\nat a stalemate.\nhe book initially makes pretence\nof being an unbiased look at the facts,\nwith the \ufb01rst third of the text being\ndevoted to reconstructing the events\nof Assange\u2019s visit to Sweden. hese reconstructions are based on the police\ninterviews with the accusers and wit-nesses, all of which have been leaked\nto the internet.\nhe accusers\u2019 interviews are often\nquite damning and humiliating for Assange, so these are con\ufb01ned to the back\nof the book as appendices, heavily annotated within the text with disputing\nstatements, and the reconstructions\nmostly use the interview statements of\ntwo members of WikiLeaks: Johannes\nWahlstr\u00f6m and Donald Bostr\u00f6m. After the reconstruction, the book then\ngets down to smearing the accusers\nand coming up with theories as to why\nthey would make false accusations.\nhe most bizarre smears are directed at the \ufb01rst accuser (the second\naccuser is painted as an easily-manip-ulated stooge, due to her dyslexia), a\nhigh pro\ufb01le member of the party hosting Assange, and fall into four catego-ries:\n1. Jealousy. After experiencing Assange\u2019s lovemaking, his accuser becomes obsessed with him. When Assange moves on to another woman,\nshe becomes furious and decides to\nexact revenge.\n2. She\u2019s a radical feminist who hates\nmen on principle, and inventing rape\naccusations is standard practice for\nfeminists. he allegations may all have\nbeen arranged via a conspiracy of lesbian feminists, as she helped to set up\na gay club. Much is made of the fact\nthat the o\ufb03cer who the crime was\nreported to was a friend of hers and\nvisited the club.\n3. To save her career. She had been\non the wrong side of a schism in her\nparty over Afghanistan, and a newspaper for progressive Muslims she was\nlaunching \ufb02opped. Faced with the falling of her star within the party, she decided to boost her pro\ufb01le by the logical step of destroying a much-admired\n\ufb01gure within her circle.\n4. She\u2019s an actual CIA mole, possibly\nalso responsible for helping the Israelis to attack the Gaza \ufb02otilla in 2010,\nas she had been a member of the \ufb02otilla support team.\nhe book proceeds to comb through\nhuge amounts of personal information in a way that becomes creepy. No\ninformation is too trivial or irrelevant\nto be included. he o\ufb03cer who took\nnote of the crime makes costume jewellery as a hobby. Pages are devoted\nto listing the photos in one of the accuser\u2019s Flickr collection.\nOn the other hand, no e\ufb00ort is made\nto even scratch the surface of the\nbackground of anybody sympathetic\nto Assange, though a simple search of\nthe internet reveals that Wahlstr\u00f6m\nand Bostr\u00f6m have both been involved\nin promoting anti-Semitic conspiracy\ntheories.\nhe transcripts of the police interviews of the accusers and witnesses\nare all available on the web, and reading those probably represents the best\nopportunity for anyone trying to ascertain whether Julian Assange has a\ncase to answer. his book fails to add\nanything meaningful to them, and\nends up being more a demonstration\nof some rather worrying elements of\nJulian Assange\u2019s support.\nO\nhe Booksellers Association will be\nhosting its annual Academic, Professional and Specialist Bookselling\n(APS) Group Conference at the Old\nShip Hotel, Brighton on March 13-14.\nhe Association represents the interests of some 95% of British bookshops\nand its conference is aimed at helping\nacademic booksellers open a dialogue\nwith students and academics.\nAlan Staton, he Booksellers Association Head of Marketing, said\nin a statement: \u201che APS conference\no\ufb00ers an increasingly important forum for publishers and booksellers\nto hear \ufb01rst-hand from students and\nlecturers about the rapidly changing\nacademic market including changes\nin behaviour and expectation. his\nwill be facilitated by a great line up of\nkey note speakers, the hugely successful student panel which is back for a\nthird year running and a new lecturer\npanel debate introduced by popular\ndemand this year.\u201d\nA spokesman told Felix that the Association was keen to promote the\nevent to students as \u201cit o\ufb00ers them\nthe unique opportunity to voice their\nopinions about book-buying and borrowing in the modern day.\u201d Attendees\n\u201cwill be able to meet publishers and\nacademic booksellers \ufb01rst hand to\ndiscuss how the increase in tuition\nfees last year and the introduction\nof digital textbooks has impacted on\nthe way in which they consume their\ntextbooks\u201d.\nhe keynote speech will be given\nby Professor Christopher F.

    "content": "CLUBS & SOCIETIES felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFRIDAY 08 MARCH\n12\nFairtrade Fortnight\nAditya Narayanan is definitely more than\nt began with an old favour-ite. A cold hursday in late\nFebruary with the promise of\nice cream; Ben & Jerry\u2019s ice\ncream to be exact. he academic year had been welcomed with\na raucous \ufb01rst session in October seeing Activity Space 1 crammed with\nattendees of a two hour frozen dessert bu\ufb00et. his time, with the second\nterm waning, a more relaxed a\ufb00air\nwas anticipated and with this in mind,\nwe had divided it into two sessions.\nhe previous three days leading to this\nmoment saw our stands in the JCR\nand SAF intermittently approached\nfor ticket purchases. But we were experienced heads in the game, knowing\nthat this was nothing more than the\ncalm before the storm.\nSure enough, with 20 minutes to\ngo, the atrium to the Physics Common Room was starting to resemble\nthe mosh pit at your average Pantera\nconcert. After much jostling through\nthe eager crowd we were \ufb01nally able\nto transfer our precious goods into\nthe room to set up the spread of what\nmust have been 15 di\ufb00erent \ufb02avours.\nAll the old favourites were there \u2013\nPhish Food, Chocolate Fudge Brownie, Cookie Dough \u2013 as well as some\nnewer ones in \u2018Core\u2019 range. Unable to\ncontain the giddy masses any further,\nthe door was allowed open and the\nswarm of sweet-toothed Imperialites\nsurged into the room.\nhe queue stretched the length of\nthe room, as our committee battled\nto maintain a steady stream of people\ncollecting their ice cream. In fact, as\nmany as 20 people were turned away\nat the door due to us being already\nstretched for resources and close to\nexceeding the capacity of the room.\nHaving advised them to book tickets\nfor the second session (which many\ndid), we breathed a sigh of relief.\nFirst crisis over. As ex-pected, despite a surfeit of\nbravado from the gelato a\ufb01cionados, the initial (sugar)\nrush abated at the halfway\nmark, with attendees struggling to maintain the electric pace with which they\nhad begun. Contented, they\nsettled down to listen to\nfour of Imperial College Debating\u2019s \ufb01nest pit their wits\nagainst each other in a 2 v\n2 verbal tussle of doom on\nwhether or not the Fairtrade\nmovement is a long term solution or\nnot.\nSession one ended with us realising\nthat we had been eaten out of our existing Ben & Jerry\u2019s supplies precipitating a mad dash to the supermarket\nto stock up on more supplies. With\nWaitrose not providing value for mon-ey, the two of us who went were faced\nwith having to sprint to Sainsbury\u2019s in\norder to make our purchase. Having\nmade it back by the skin of our teeth,\nwe prepared for the second half.\nhis time the numbers were slightly\nreduced from the \ufb01rst session putting paid to the idea that students are\nmostly nocturnal creatures. he less\nhectic conditions presented the \ufb01rst\nopportunity to stage the notorious ice\ncream race \u2013 something that had been\ninadvertently forgotten due to the intensity of the session. hat presented\na signi\ufb01cant physical and mental challenge to all competitors in the form of\nbrainfreeze. Whosoever could \ufb01nish\nheaped bowl of ice cream in the shortest time would earn the most prestigious prize of all: respect. And a couple\nof tubs of ice cream for good measure.\nAt the sound of \u2018go\u2019, they were o\ufb00.\nLike salmon swimming upstream,\npieces of Ben & Jerry\u2019s freed themselves of their inanimate nature, leaping gleefully into the open mouths of\nthe competitors. Within seconds it\nwas clear that there was a ferocious\nbattle emerging between Nick \u2018the\nfridge-freezer\u2019 Politis and a mysteri-ous, unnamed stranger. With the committee wondering whether a photo\n\ufb01nish would be required the enigmatic\nman in black slammed his bowl down\non the table, and strolled o\ufb00 nonchalantly to the gasps of the crowd. With\nthat done, everyone settled down for a\nsecond set of dazzling debaters to tussle with the important Fairtrade question of the night.\nAfter such a manic night, the perfect antidote materialised in a sedate\nknitting session with Knitsock in SAF\nusing Fairtrade yarn. Under our un-mistakeable Fairtrade banner and the\nexpert tutelage of the Knitsock com-mittee, a crowd gradually perambu-Cooperating with Fairtrade Society was a fantastic experience which culminated in a Fairtrade Tea and Chocolate Event. Being the President of Tea Society for this academic year, I can say we had already tried to promote links\nwith other societies, for example through a joint event with Cooking Society. We believe many societies share common interests and that drawing different people from different\nclubs together when possible will make the Union\nmore vibrant. Fairtrade relates to lots of things\nin our everyday life and this event has made my\ncommittee realise it would be very easy to incorporate Fairtrade in our weekly events. Hearing\nfirst-hand accounts from enthusiastic cocoa\nfarmers from Ghana converted to Fairtrade was\na brilliant way of making everyone who came\naware of how beneficial Fairtrade can be. Nevertheless, this was primarily a FREE tea and chocolate\ntasting event so no matter how you may feel towards the\nFairtrade movement, it would have been worth coming! I am\nlooking forward to seeing more cooperation between societies\nwithin the Union as well as more Fairtrade over the campus. Finally, I would\nlike to give big thanks to all the Fairtrade committee members who have spent\nhours organising this Fairtrade fortnight. Come along to our Teasoc meetings\nto enjoy some Fairtrade tea alongside our usual selection!\nTeasingly Fairtrade\nPauline Vaskou\nI\nTeaSoc President\nThat presented a significant\nphysical and\nmental challenge to all...\nbrainfreeze\n\n"

I shall not comment on\nwhether that content was o\ufb00ensive or\nnot, though, it was concerning to hear\nthat the returning o\ufb03cers in fact hold\npositions in the welfare department.\nIt is not surprising that people who\nwork for the Union informally support\none candidate, though I feel it is undesirable to have the people who work for,\nif that is the correct relation, a candidate\nto be in the role of ensuring that an election is run fairly. It is also a worrying\nsign that it is not widely published who\nthe returning o\ufb03cers are, unless I am\nunable to properly navigate the union\nwebsite.\nIt is, as far as I know, a rare situation\nfor a incumbent sabbatical to run for\nelection again, but when it happens is\nperfectly understandable why people\nclosely linked to the union would support them due to their vast experience.\nWith this considered, more checks and\nbalances must be bought in to prevent\nthis preference having a major in\ufb02uence\non the election result.\nAnonymous\n---Sir,\nI would like the College to address the\nserious lack of napping space around\ncampus.\nI am a frequent snoozer, and I \ufb01nd\nthat during times of tiredness, getting\na good nap is imperative to being able\nto concentrate e\ufb00ectively on my work.\nIn this regard, College\u2019s abject failure\nto provide napping space has been seriously detrimental to my academic de-velopment.\nOften my only options for getting some much-needed shuteye are\nsprawled over the uncomfortable folding chairs in empty lecture theaters, or\non the sofa of a highly-public common\nroom (to the chagrin of all other users of\nthe space). Clearly this is not bene\ufb01cial\nto anyone.\nWhat I would thus like to suggest is\nthe establishment of an Imperial College Napping Society: give them a small\nroom and some camp beds, and solve\nthe napping crisis once and for all!\nAnonymous\nAnum Farooq\nLet\u2019s Find Out Then!\now, I have a huge confession to make. Well,\nit\u2019s something that I\ncan\u2019t really help, aside\nfrom the non-stop\nverbal diarrhea.

    "content": "ARTS\nArts Editors: Eva Rosenthal,\nMeredith Thomas\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFRIDAY 08 MARCH 45\n\u201cWhaam!\u201d is probably one of the most\nreproduced pieces of art on the plan-et. hat bold comic style, that distinctive script, the perfect coloured dots...\nhe piece is so distinctively Lichtenstein that it has perhaps come to de\ufb01ne him as an artist. However as this\nretrospective shows, Roy Lichtenstein\nis so much more than that.\nAround the time when he was playing around with comic strips and\n\u2018Benday dots\u2019, Lichtenstein was also\nexperimenting with sculpture, and\nwhile I am not normally a fan, I could\nnot help but enjoy some of his massive\nmonochrome installations. Perhaps it\nis because I am quite into my writing\n(and stationery!), but an absolutely\ngiant version of one of those classic \u2018compositions\u2019 notebooks got me\ngenuinely excited about the potential\nfor the massive stories and ideas they\nmight contain. Meanwhile I found\nmyself unexpectedly moved looking\ninto one of his \u2018mirrors\u2019, and \ufb01nding\nthat I had no re\ufb02ection; as though he\nhad somehow managed to immerse\nmy character completely within his\nart. Lichtenstein has a way of looking\nat things, a way of understanding both\nthe cultural identity and physical geometry of his subject matter, through\nwhich by reducing them to lines and\ncolours he somehow manages to make\nthem say more.\nIn contrast, the comic strip paintings that made Lichtenstein famous\ndid little for me. Perhaps it is because by now they have become so\noverused, so synonymous with the\nvery idea of pop-art, that it is kind\nof impossible to have a fresh opinion\nabout them. Also, not being much of\na comic-reader myself, I have very little pre-Lichtenstein comic imagery in\nmy head for the pieces to play o\ufb00 of or\ntap into. Meanwhile the commentary\nhe makes in the pieces about gender\nroles in American society are, I think,\nbetter expressed by his earlier and\nsimpler works.\nHowever, Lichtenstein\u2019s interpretation of the subject of female nudes is\nthe only one I have ever liked. I am\nnot sure why, although perhaps it is\nbecause the naked women he depicts\nare having fun for once. For the \ufb01rst\ntime ever, I did not question why\nthese women were naked and vul-nerable, nor his agenda, but instead\nappreciated his classic dotty, colourful treatment of them, the beautiful\ncurved lines, the clever layering of\npatterns and imagery. In fact, such is\nLichtenstein\u2019s sensitivity to the social\ncontext of his work that the women\u2019s\nchoice and style of clothes, had they\nbeen wearing any, would probably\nhave said more about them and in that\nway been more distracting than their\nnakedness.\nHis unusual series on landscapes\nand seascapes however were not quite\nso powerful or engaging for me. It\nwas not that they were not technically\ngood, or emotive, but by restricting\nhimself to sparse broad brushstrokes\nor sheets of bendy plastic, Lichtenstein prevented his own distinctive\nstyle from emerging through. (It does\nnot help that the depiction of a sunset\nhas been done many times before, and\nby some very, very good artists.) He\nalso produced some fairly weird and\nabstract installations during his \u2018modern\u2019 phase, such as a recreation of a\nclassic red velvet rope strung between\ntwo golden posts, such as one might\n\ufb01nd in a fancy theatre, that seemed\njust too far removed from any human\ntouch for me to emotionally respond\nto.\nBut that is the magic of a retrospec-tive. By spanning over 40 years of\nwork of an incredibly interesting and\nsurprisingly varied artist, you feel like\nyou really are getting a chance to see\neverything Lichtenstein did; the good,\nthe bad and the ugly. And by seeing\neverything, from his self-conscious\nearly works and studies, before he\nhad really found his footing as a pop-artist, to his later experiments with\nthe styles of artists wildly di\ufb00erent\nto his own, you begin to understand\nLichtenstein in some way, and realise\nthat he is quite a special artist. Every\npiece of his art seems completely un-self-centred and yet distinctly his. He\nhas real talent but does not make you\nfeel guilty or intimidated for not having the same. Most of all, Lichtenstein\nseems to just really enjoy making his\nart.\nGetting to the points of Lichenstein\nArianna Sorba Writer\nI C V S\nM E D I C S\nH E AT S\nR E Y N O L D S B A R , C H A R I N G\nC R O S S H O S P I TA L\nT H U R S DA Y 2 8 T H F E B R U A R Y\n7. 3 0 P M\nF I N A L S\nM E T R I C B A R , B E I T Q U A D\nT U E S DA Y 1 2 T H M A R C H\n7. 3 0 P M\nC o m e d o w n a n d w a t c h u s k i c k\ns t a r t v a r s i t y i n s t y l e a s t h e I C\nb a n d s g o h e a d - t o - h e a d w i t h\nI C S M b a n d s !\nC o m e s u p p o r t y o u r s i d e ,\na n d p r e p a r e f o r t w o\ne l e c t r i f y i n g n i g h t s !\nO N LY \u00a3 2 E N T R Y !\nS\nS U P P O R T I N G\nI C S M\nR A G\nDon\u2019t waste this\nspace... write for\nFelix.\nEmail in now:\nfelix@imperial.ac.uk\n\n"

Follow us on\nFacebook, where we\u2019ll post up exciting stories to keep your cravings\nsatisfied.\nfacebook.com/Felixscience\nWhat happens when we tell stories about science?\nSarah Byrne Science Writer\nWhat does happen when we tell stories about science? hat was the question the panel of academics attempted\nto answer at the LSE/Imperial Literary\nFestival event last Wednesday even-ing.\nhe aims described at the beginning were both ambitious and a bit\nvague. We were going to examine the\nrelationship between science and nar-rative, and see science escaping from\nthe lab into the \u2018real\u2019 world, where we\nwould examine whether its \u2018state\u2019 was\n\u2018altered\u2019. What actually happened was\nthat each panellist simply told a story\nof their own, giving a di\ufb00erent perspective on science and technology,\nfollowed by a more general discussion.\nGreg Artus, Imperial philosophy\nand ethics lecturer, recounted the activities of Annie Ducan, the infamous\nforensic chemist jailed for falsifying\nvast amounts of evidence. his example of a corrupt and criminal scientist\nwas supposed to be a counterpoint to\nthe \u2018story\u2019 we tell ourselves about how\nscience is pure and rari\ufb01ed. here was\nmaybe a bit of a lack of self-awareness\nhere; does anyone really believe\nthat scientists are anything\nbut human? Could this itself\nbe a \u2018story\u2019 that smug humanities types tell them-selves? Where is the\nevidence that it\u2019s\ntrue?\nNext up, Richard\nBronk from LSE\u2019s\nEuropean Institute\nwas not the most\ncharismatic or\nengaging speak-er. Reading\nfrom notes, he\nsounded more\nlike he was\nr e c i t i n g\nan essay than\ntelling a\nstory. But he\nwas well worth the e\ufb00ort of listening\nt o , actually having some of the\nmost profound in-sights. Stories, he\nsaid, are essential.\nhey\u2019re the way\nwe make sense\nof the\nc o m -plex reality\naround us.\nhey\u2019re like\nlanterns illuminating\nthe truth,\nbut like\nreal lanterns they\nonly show\nus a limited\narea at a time.\nTo see the\nfull picture,\nyou need\nmore than\none story, more than one viewpoint:\nsticking to one traditional narrative is\nnot enough.\nAifric Campbell, novelist, ex-banker\nand creative writing lecturer at Imperial, showed us how storytelling was\ndone, with a three-decade-spanning,\nsecond-person present-tense narrative about the emergence of complex\nmathematics in \ufb01nance. he moral of\nthe story was the way the language/\nculture divide between scientists and\nnon-scientists hampers communication and understanding, and the very\nbad outcomes this can lead to.\nFinally Imperial\u2019s professor of surgery Roger Kneebone made everyone\nlaugh with his misadventures in science engagement, speci\ufb01cally his controversial strategy of staging dramatized medical emergencies without\nthe audience\u2019s knowledge. he key\nmessage here seemed to be the importance of emotional engagement in science communication, but also how it\ncan be a double-edged sword.\nOnce the discussion was opened\nup to questions, things started to get\nmore philosophical. Some scientists\nin the audience might have been starting to get uncomfortable at this point,\nwith the tendency to equate science\nwith stories, and it was a relief when\nsomeone raised the point that must\nhave been on many people\u2019s minds.\nOnce we start talking about truth as\nnarrative, scienti\ufb01c \ufb01ndings as stories\nwe tell ourselves, how far does that\ntake us down the road of postmodern-ism? Don\u2019t we end up in the dubious\nposition of arguing that truth is rela-tive, science is only one way of viewing the world and no more or less valid\nthan any other opinion or story?\nAnswering that was left to a \ufb01nal\nbit of stealth-eloquence from Richard\nBronk. Quoting Wordsworth he described how we \u2018half-create\u2019 the world:\nthat there is objective truth, but there\nare also stories, and together, insepa-rable, they make up our understanding of reality. And on that point, both\nscientists and philosophers can probably agree.\nGraphene: Ready to revolutionise solar power\nYes, that\u2019s right. You might have heard\nof graphene already. his Christmas\nthe government invested \u00a322 million\ninto the so dubbed \u2018super-material\u2019.\nImperial College London received\n\u00a34.5 million, which, distributed between 3 research projects, hopes to\ncontribute to the international quest\nfor graphene technologies.\nGraphene has astonished scientists\naround the world with its fantastic\nelectrical conductivity and mechanical properties. Soon after its discovery in 2004 (for which the researchers\nwon the 2010 Noble Prize in Physics)\npeople started saying that it would\nshake the silicon empire to pieces and\nbring about a new technological era.\nGraphene seems to have much more\nto say.\nLast week a paper published in Nature Physics attributes another fantastic property to graphene: it can\nefficiently convert light into electric-ity. he research, undertaken by he\nInstitute of Photonic Sciences of Barcelona (www.icfo.eu) is indeed highly\nexciting.\nWhy?\nCurrent solar cells are expensive to\nproduce and not that efficient. E\ufb00orts\nto make them out of other materials\nhave not quite culminated yet. he\nincorporation of graphene into the\n\ufb01eld brings new hopes and possibili-ties. Last week Spanish newspaper La\nVanguardia published that the unex-Amanda Diez Science Writer pected results could have an impact\nequivalent to the development of plastics in the 20th century.\nSo how does this conversion of light\ninto electricity work?\nConventionally semiconductors\nsuch as silicon are used. hey have\nthe property of conducting electricity\nneither brilliantly nor poorly. Somehow this mediocrity makes them absolutely great. he how is as follows:\nelectrons cannot be accelerated by an\nelectric \ufb01eld (and hence conduct elec-tricity) because in order to do so they\nwould have to enter forbidden energy\nlevels of the material.\nHowever, if by some means they\nreach the empty energy levels above\nthe forbidden region they are free.\nFree to move, accelerate, conduct\nelectricity or whatever else you want.\nHow can they achieve this? Light. Enlightenment. he electrons are danc-science\nNe\nFac\ning\nsat\nfac\nWe have been reliably informed that\nthis funky image is science-related\ning around the material when suddenly a photon (an energy packet of\nlight) hits them on the head much like\nan intruding asteroid. Due to a much\nmore celestial coincidence than Newton\u2019s apple they are suddenly (if the\nenergy packet is large enough) put in a\n(high and allowed) energy state. Since\nmost high energy states are empty and\nfree to access they can now accelerate\nas much as they want. Due to the potential gradient created by the di\ufb00erent materials of the cell, the electrons\nactually do want to accelerate and naturally do so, thus creating a current.\nAll this explanation was actually\nuseless and just for fun because gra-phene is not a semiconductor. he\nmessage to take home however is that\nif electrons are put into a higher energy state they relax back to a lower\nstate, releasing heat (which is useless\nand also a nuisance). Hence, a lot of\nthe high-energy radiation is lost into\nheat making it all very inefficient. In\ngraphene, when the electrons relax,\nthey give that energy to other electrons which can then also conduct\nelectricity (they are very generous in-deed). his means more energy from\nthe radiation is converted into elec-tricity, making it an absolutely excellent material, as we all already knew.\nDOI: 10.1038/nphys2564\n\u201c\nAn impact\nequivalent to\nplastic development in the\n20th century\nFacebook\nicfo.eu\nFRIDAY 08 MARCH\n38\n\n"

In LUSL, after narrowly loosing to RVC by\none point, we can still win the league, but it will come down to a grudge match\nagainst UCL on the last weekend of the season. As a club we are mixed with\nboth medics and IC and so for Varsity we split the team in half and play 7\u2019s or\n10\u2019s against each other. Despite the fact that we know one another very well our\ncompetitive spirit always takes over and it is a \ufb01ercely fought game, although the\nmedics have never lost Varsity and are looking to continue this winning streak\nin 2013!\nTwo of the leading try scorers for the team, Kath Fok and Sammy Gottardi,\nare both medics and so are de\ufb01nitely ones for IC to watch out for.

Once again\nlooking forward to seeing Spiderpig\u2019s\n\u2018interesting\u2019 kicking tekkers.\nHow is your season going? Have you\nhad any memorable moments?\nWe have had a very enjoyable season\nso far and have relished in the opportunity of playing Prem B level competing with some of the best rugby universities in the country.\nOne memorable moment would be\ntravelling to Brighton \u2013 one of our biggest promotion rivals from last season\n\u2013 and smashing them.\nWhy do you play rugby? If you were\nto play another sport, what would it\nbe?\nI enjoy the sense of camaraderie and\nphysicality of the game \u2013 Rugby is\nunique in this aspect. I also like the anticipation of knowing that every week\na new battle will be had on a Wednesday afternoon.\nWater polo because it has a similar\nethos to rugby in terms of the physical-ity and technical skill element that is\nrequired under constant pressure and\n\ufb01tness demands.\nWhat do you think of the opposition\u2019s season and how do you see\nknow how demoralising it can be.

IMRFC are looking forward to correcting last year\u2019s\nwrongs, so it should be a good game\nagainst he Ginger and his merry\nmen.\nOverall I think this year probably IC\n(as long as Badminton continues to be\nplayed at Varsity).\nName a player you expect to standout at Varsity?\nAnyone wearing a phoenix.\nHow is your season going? Have\nyou had any memorable mo-ments?\nIMRFC have had a strong season, as\nthe season has progressed we\u2019ve continued to improve. Memorable moments would be strong wins in our\nleague, playing in some of the worst\nconditions known to man, a great tour\nto Nottingham and the odd bit of debauchery o\ufb00 the pitch.\nWhy do you play rugby? If you were\nto play another sport, what would it\nbe?\nMan is caged by the con\ufb01nes of soci-ety, culture and education. Rugby is\njust an outlet.

We have been\nvery successful in both the LUSL and\nBUCS leagues, maintaining a position\nin the top half of the table for both\nand are close to promotion in BUCS.\nLosing one of our key players, Toni\nSemmence, to injury midway through\nthe season, was a shock but the team\nrallied to \ufb01ll in her position and continues to play great netball. Our stand\nout player this season has been Harriet Rumgay who was bought from the\n4s at the start of the year but has \ufb01tted\ninto the team seamlessly.\nFrom a disappointing season last year,\nculminating in our loss at Varsity,\nthe ICSM 2nd team has gone from\nstrength to strength this year. Our\nperformance in the LUSL league has\nreally demonstrated our skill and versatility on the court; we have beaten\nboth IC 2s and IC 3s and are currently\npondering the prospect of promotion.\nhe nerves for Varsity have already\nkicked in. he psychological training has started, the \ufb01tness sessions\nhave commenced and we are ready\nto do something which the Medics\nNetball Club has managed to do for\nas long as I can remember: beat IC.\nhe sheer accuracy of our shooters\nshould be enough to make Imperial\nquake in their trainers, let alone the\nsprightliness of our centre court players and the lightning fast hands of our\ndefence. he ICSM 2nd team are in\na better position than this time last\nyear; we are ready for you IC.\nPlayers to watch: Emily Boyce (C) will\nscream at the top of her voice for that\nball \u2013 and always get it, and Hiba Saleem Danish (GK) has arms that come\nout of nowhere and will do anything to\nstop you scoring.\nhe 3s have had a season of ups and\ndowns, currently 3rd in both league\ntables there is de\ufb01nitely potential for\nus to move up a few spaces in the coming weeks. Two years ago the Varsity\nmatch was won by 1 goal, last year it\nwas lost by 2, and this year we hope\nto come away with a win! he third\nteam lost many of its senior players\nlast year, so this season we have been\nbuilding new relationships and getting\nto know a whole new team \u2013 players\nto look out for are fresher shooter Isobel and our senior Centre, Amelia.\nThis season had a slow start for the\n3s however they picked up their\ngame through some hard training\nand this year got further in LUSL\ncup than ever before! Expectations\nare high for Varsity- as ever in Netball- so expect a highly-strung close\nmatch between both 3s teams. Players to watch- our new freshers that\njoined 3rd team with some great defensive skills. Watch out IC!\nThis season has been quite a good\none for the 4th team, which is playing in LUSL. Of course, we had ups\nand downs, as some players got in-jured. We all managed to improve\nour skills, from girls that were new\nto the sport to returning netballers:\none of us even got promoted to the\n2s. Talking of promotion, depending on the outcome of our next\nmatch against LSE, we might get\npromoted in the league!\nWe will definitively put on a fight at\nVarsity and give our best against the\nmedics.\nAfter earning promotion to the BUCS\nSouth Eastern 8A League, it has been\na challenging season for ICSM 4s. We\nhave welcomed lots of new players into\nthe team who have all made valuable\ncontributions over the season. Despite a\ndi\ufb03cult start, the 4s have really come together as a team giving us some encouraging results. Shooters Rosa and Chandni have gone from strength to strength\nthisseasonandarenowaformidablepair\nin the attacking third. Nat Ilenkovan has\nbeen invaluable in defence and a great\nsupporting player in centre court. Having recently beaten Imperial College 3s,\nICSM 4s are going into the Varsity match\nknowing that it will be tough but we are\ncapable of victory if we give 110%!\nhe 5th team previously being a social\nteam has grown this season by being entered into the LUSL league. We started o\ufb00\nthe year with a new team who had never\nplayed together before and some who had\nnever played netball.

At less than three minutes long,\nthe short is snappy, horrifying, and\ncrackles with an energy rarely found\nin horror \ufb01lms; Muschietti took a\nscalpel to the genre, leaving it with\nonly the bare bones of a psychological horror \ufb02ick. his restraint gave\nthe \ufb01lm its tense atmosphere, and\nunfortunately drew it to the attention of Guillermo del Toro, who has\nnow added it to his growing rostra\nof \ufb01lms labelled \u2018Guillermo del Toro\nPresents\u2026\u2019. Del Toro has taken the\npremise of the short, and stretched it\nout over 100 minutes, transforming\nthe elegant skeleton of Muschietti\u2019s\noriginal into a bloated, sagging ca-daver, buckling under the weight of\nclich\u00e9s contained within.\nIn the original we have no context\n\u2013 we don\u2019t know who, or indeed what\nMama is \u2013 whereas this edition props\nitself up with a backstory: in 2008, at\nthe height of the \ufb01nancial crisis, an\nunstable banker kills his business\npartner and wife, before taking his\ndaughters to a cabin in the woods\nwhere he plans to shoot them. Before this can happen, he is killed by\na shadowy \ufb01gure. Skipping forward\nto the present day, the two girls are\nfound by their uncle (Carter-Waldau),\nand move in with him and his \u2018alternative\u2019 girlfriend (Chastain), who is\nunready for the responsibilities of\nchild-raising. Shortly after this, they\nbegin to be visited by \u2018Mama\u2019, a demonic guardian who terrorises the\nsurrogate parents. I won\u2019t reveal the\nrest of the story, su\ufb03ce to say that\nthere is very little that is extraordinary in terms of plot.\nhe \ufb01lm is supposedly set in an\nunnamed North American town \u2013\n\ufb01lmed in Toronto and Quebec \u2013 but I\nrefuse to believe this. I think instead\nthat the \ufb01lm takes place in some kind\nof alternative universe; a universe\nin which every conceivable trope in\nthe horror genre goes to die \u2013 lights\n\ufb02icker on and o\ufb00, dimly lit hospital\ncorridors grow mould on their walls,\nand everyone seems to travel at night,\nalone, and without any means of con-tact. Instead of o\ufb00ering us a new\ntake on the supernatural horror \ufb01lm,\nMuschietti and del Toro have delivered an unimaginative, dull \ufb01lm, in\nwhich cheap shocks are delivered as\nregularly as the chimes of Big Ben.\nI do pity Jessica Chastain. Fresh\nfrom her disappointment at the 2013\nOscars, in which she missed out on\nBest Actress for her incredible portrayal of a CIA operative on the hunt\nfor Bin Laden, she now has to appear\nin a \ufb01lm whose clunky, inorganic dialogue would make even Jack Nicholson seem robotic. Her role in the \ufb01lm,\nthat of an archetypal \u2018rebel-chick\u2019\n(think black, cropped hair, bass gui-tars, tattoos, and frequent use of the\nphrase \u2018whatever\u2019) who develops a\nbond with the orphans, does no justice to her talent. If her recent performances in other \ufb01lms are anything to\ngo by, Chastain is clearly a sublime\nactress, and although she tries to\nshine in the role she is ultimately let\ndown by the incredibly poor script-writing; seriously, any writer who\nincludes the line \u2018do you believe in\nghosts?\u2019 in their screenplay deserves\nto be exiled from Hollywood for disservices to cinema.\nOne of the only great parts of the\n\ufb01lm comes in the pint-sized forms\nof Megan Charpentier and Isabelle\nN\u00e9lisse, who play the orphans Victoria and Lilly respectively. From\nhe Omen\u2019s Damien horn, to the\ncreepy twins in Kubrick\u2019s he Shining, it is a well-established fact that\nchildren are completely terrifying;\nCharpentier and N\u00e9lisse ramp up the\nchill factor to eleven, giving performances that are both physically and\nmentally unnerving, showing talent\nfar beyond their years. Had the \ufb01lmmakers kept this innate creepiness in\nthe girls the focus of the \ufb01lm, rather\nthan fragmenting it with unnecessary side-stories and \ufb02imsy character\ndevelopment, it could have become\nsomething truly special.\nMama is a perfect example of a\ngood idea poorly executed. It had\nall the right ingredients to become a\nchilling, psychological horror \u2013 voices coming from the walls, mentally\ndisturbed children, ghostly presences \u2013 but chose instead to trade this in\nfor cheap thrills. Go and see the \ufb01lm\nif you enjoy \u2018jump-in-your-seat\u2019 moments and gruesome CGI, just don\u2019t\nexpect to be kept up at night.\nThe Three Performances to watch\nhe Debt (2010) he Help (2011) Zero Dark hirty (2012)\n\n"

Extensive discourse took place surrounding a\nmodern phenomenon known as\n\u2018virtuous meritocracy\u2019. In basic\nterms, it has its origins in previous American governmental pol-icy. Concessions were repeatedly\nawarded to school pupils from\nhumble backgrounds considered\n\u2018bright\u2019. Many were actively consumed into the Ivy League and\nState University ranks via scholarships and funding. In turn this\nselect core of students secured\nthe most coveted (and highest\nearning) business and academic\npositions upon graduation. It will\nbe no surprise to learn that they\nwere intent on retaining what\nthey had achieved \u2018on merit\u2019; their\nendeavours were the embodiment\nof the American dream. However,\nlike many aspects of a changing\nmodern America, the dream has\nbeen tainted. Some argue that this\ngroup of intelligent nouveau riche\nmonopolise both jobs and educa-tion, passing their emancipation\n(and their money) onto their chil-dren, with the squeezed middle\nand working class losing out.\nAddressing the 2010/2011 statistics recently published by the\nHigher Education Statistics Agency this may also be a problem\nmuch closer to home. Consider\nthe \u2018big academic three\u2019 UK Universities (The University of Oxford, The University of Cambridge\n& Imperial College London). Undergraduate participants from\ndisenfranchised \u2018low participation neighbourhoods\u2019 comprised\n2.5%, 3.1% and 4.6 % respectively.\nThese figures are significantly low\nwith respect to the overall UK\nUniversity average of 10.5%.\nThe statistics relevant to Imperial College London can be ration-alised. First and foremost the high\nproportion of overseas students\nmust be taken into account; International fees cannot be classed\nThe Virtuous Meritocracy\nas cheap, frequently breaking the\n\u00a320,000 barrier. The location of\nthe College within one of the most\nfinancially draining cities on the\nplanet inevitably plays its part. In\naddition to this the institution is\nwidely renowned but principally\nwithin academic circles.\nFrom the HESA statistics these\nfactors have a strong influence\non the student demographic. It\ncannot be denied that Imperial\nCollege London best endeavours\nto provide a first-class education to all students, championing\nmany schemes such as the College\nHardship Fund. On a student-by-student basis this assistance\nis invaluable. It might therefore\nbe concluded that the trend observed in the wider student population reflects a monopoly headed\nby those in a position to afford the\nbest in a growing market of global\neducation.\nSo what might be done about\nthis? There needs to be a re-set-ting and subsequent balance of\nthe student demographic of top\nacademic institutions across the\nplanet, with sufficient contribution from the \u2018low participation\nneighbourhoods\u2019. A fresh wave\nof outreach media should be considered in order to scout underly-ing, hidden talent within school\npupils from working class back-grounds. Judging from statistics\npublished on Wednesday by the\nEnd Child Poverty campaign this\nmay be particularly applicable\nto the United Kingdom, where\nareas such as West Belfast (with\n43% of children raised in pov-erty) and factions of Manchester\nare in desperate need of revival.\nThis might reduce the advantage\nthat pupils from financially sound\nbackgrounds invariably possess,\nbe it in the form of private tuition\nor exposure to academic rigour. In\nthis way a turn of fortune might\nbe granted to a new generation of\ndisenfranchised but academically\ngifted pupils, allowing them their\nfair share in the cake of merit.\nEoghan J Totten\nAt the core of student opposition to the\nCollege\u2019s decision to close Garden Hall\nand open a new residence in North Acton is a concern for Imperial\u2019s less well\no\ufb00 students. Campus Services seems to\nhave demonstrated an utter disregard\nfor the possibility that poorer students\nmay be forced out o\ufb00 campus, separated from their classmates and their\nunion. his raises di\ufb03cult questions;\nwhat proportion of Imperial\u2019s students\ncome from less privileged economic\nbackgrounds, and how do we compare\nto other institutions? Is Imperial \u2018needs\nblind\u2019\n, or a science, medicine and engineering \ufb01nishing school?\nTo answer this, Felix has turned to the\nPerformance Indicator data sets made\navailable by the Higher Education Statistics Authority (HESA), which aim to\nevaluate the success of UK HE institutions in widening student provision,\nteaching outcomes and other factors.\nUnfortunately, currently available datasets only run to the 2010/11 admissions\nperiod, meaning the impact of the fees\nincrease cannot be considered, but the\ndata speaks volumes.\nhe tables give the proportion of\nyoung, \ufb01rst-time degree students coming from State Schools, as well as the\npercentage coming from poorer socioeconomic backgrounds (National Statistics Socio-Economic Classes 4-7).\nhe latter measure is an established\nnational measure of socio-economic\nbackground based on current employment that was developed for the 2001\ncensus.\nImperial is consistently signi\ufb01cantly\n(p<0.05) below the national average\nin both measures, with an average of\n62.9% of students coming from state\nschools, and 17.25% from NS-SEC\nclasses 4-7 over the period 06/07-10/11.\nhis is compared to the UK averages of\n88.4% and 30% respectively; almost 4 in\n10 Imperial students come from private\neducation, and the vast majority come\nfrom more privileged economic back-grounds.\nhat said, it is interesting to compare\nour performance with that of near-rivals and fellow Russell Group institu-tions, Oxford, Cambridge and UCL. In\nboth measures, we perform comparably to UCL, and consistently better than\nOxbridge in terms of equal access to\nlearning. Considering the statistics also\naim to evaluate to what extent institutions can widen participation in Higher\nEducation, the lack of any improvement\nacross the years is also concerning.\nHowever, for a more valid assessment\nof Imperial\u2019s performance, we should\nconsider the \u201cBenchmark\u201d performance put together by the HESA. he\nbenchmark scores attempt to control\nfor other factors, to give a measure of\nhow well a given institution \u2018should\u2019 be\nperforming based on factors such as\nlocation, subject, gender and ethnicity of applicants. Signi\ufb01cant variation\naway from these benchmarks can be\nused to infer additional factors a\ufb00ecting an institution\u2019s admissions, or may\nsuggest an in\ufb02uence that has not been\naccounted for.\nWhen it comes to percentage of\nstudents from state schools, Imperial performed signi\ufb01cantly below its\nbenchmark percentage every year in\nthe period 06/07-10/11. he picture\nfor socio-economic class was more var-ied, with Imperial alternately punching above and below expected values,\nbut never with a statistically signi\ufb01cant\nvariation.\nhat Imperial doesn\u2019t vary signi\ufb01cantly from the expected proportion\nfrom lower NS-SEC classes, despite\nthe higher than average number of\nstudents from private schools, is perhaps testament to the College\u2019s support\nprovision. For example, Study Support\nBursaries are available to all UK students receiving a maintenance grant.\nhe below expected percentage of state\nschool students, however, lacks a clear\nexplanation.\nTaken alongside the nationally low\naverages of Imperial and other Russell\nGroup institutions, the data seems to\nreveal structural problems in the British education system. Imperial\u2019s high\ngrade requirements mean that students\nfrom better o\ufb00 backgrounds can end up\nover represented.\nhe new Pro-Rector (Education) has\nstated that the College has expanded\nits outreach programme, aiming to en-There needs to be\na re-setting and\nsubsequent balance\nof the student\ndemographic of top\nacademic institutions\nThere ne\nThere ne\na re sett\na re sett\n\u201d\nc of top\nc of top\nstitutions\nstitutions\ncourage more students to apply to university and to Imperial. But outreach\nis just one aspect that can in\ufb02uence\naccess to Higher Education from less\nprivileged backgrounds, and, as these\nstatistics highlight, the College can still\nimprove substantially. Positive discrimination policies, such as \ufb02exible grade\nboundaries, do not necessitate sacri\ufb01cing academic standards.\n\n"

Daniel Day-Lewis does his very best \u2018pick me\nsir, pick me\u2019 for the Best Actor Oscar, and boy does it pay o\ufb00. he war scene\nat the beginning alone makes it worth the watch, and though the story is well\nknown, slaves and war and things, this \ufb01lm is woven together so beautifully\nyou cannot help but get swept away.\n2) To continue the theme, we go from\nthe abolition of slavery to, well, slav-ery. hat\u2019s right, it\u2019s Quentin Tarantino\u2019s latest baby \u2013 Django Unchained.\nAnd don\u2019t you worry, it\u2019s as crazy as\nalways. Not only is this an excellent\n\ufb01lm, but it\u2019s also one of the few times\nthat you can tell someone you are\nwatching a \ufb01lm that includes whips\nand chains and not have them look at\nyou judgingly.\n3) Next up, it\u2019s time to grab your tis-sues, hankies or perhaps the sleeves\nof the unsuspecting stranger sat next\nto you. Get ready to sing along, or\ncry along, to Les Miserables. If you\nwatched the Oscars you would have\nseen an emotional Anne Hathaway\nreceive her best supporting actress\naward whilst crying, for a \ufb01lm in\nwhich most of her acting was crying.\nHave I mentioned that this \ufb01lm is a\nbit sad?\n4) Every Oscars needs a controversy,\nand this year that role was taken by\nZero Dark hirty. Featuring a, well,\ncontroversial, torture scene this \ufb01lm,\ndirected by Kathryn Bigelow \u2013 winner of the 2010 best picture for the\nHurt Locker \u2013 does it again, this time\nwith a gritty adaptation of the search\nfor Bin-Laden. Which, according to\nthe tagline at least, is the greatest\nmanhunt in history.\n5) Finally, we couldn\u2019t resist taking\nyou back to where it all began. It\u2019s\nthe totally historically accurate and\n100% true Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter. Okay, maybe I lied about\nthe previous two points, but here is a\n\ufb01lm that takes itself so seriously that\nit cannot help but be hilarious.\nSo there it is. Five \ufb01lms. Fourteen\nhours. hirteen miles of \ufb01lm. Are you\nman (or woman) enough to make it?\nhe Cinema Spring-All Nighter is\non the 19th March.\nTickets are \u00a310 online, or \u00a312 on\nthe night, with individual \ufb01lms\navailable on the door for \u00a33.\nTickets available from tickets.im-perialcinema.co.uk\n\n"

Before long, the entire\narea was teeming with happy knit-ters, learning how to di\ufb00erentiate weft\nfrom warp like pros. It was the perfect\npreparation for the weekend, and as\na committee we left brimming with\nenthusiasm for what awaited us in the\nsecond week.\nOn Monday night two wonderful\nteachers from the Kings Road branch\nof Lush, the cosmetics company, who\nwere giving a class on making face\nmasks. Only 20 places were available,\nmost of which were taken up by female students. However, contrary to\nthe Imperial stereotype there were\nseveral gallant, metrosexual men in\nattendance, unafraid to take care of\nthemselves. Indeed, the male Fairtrade committee members even got in\non the act, with a certain webmaster\nseeming especially keen on the hand\nmassage.\nhree events down. Two were left,\nafter the unfortunate postponement\nof the Future Trade conference with\nthe PPS. Originally billed as \u2018he\nBrawl in the Lecture Hall\u2019, this was\nslated to pit Fairtrade heavyweight\nBarbara Crowther (Director of Public\nCommunications) against a cohort of\nbrainiacs from thinktank the Institute\nfor Economic A\ufb00airs. Sadly, the latter\ngroup were ultimately unable to \ufb01nd\ncomplementary dates in their sched-Last Friday, KnitSock and Fairtrade Society joined forces to take over the SAF\nfoyer, in the most recent stage of our bid to unleash Fairtrade, yarny fun to\nthe world. Yes, our steps towards our ultimate aim are modest, (we would argue realistic) but what a resounding success this bid was! We had beautiful\nFairtrade yarn to give to participants, we had Fairtrade hot drinks to keep the\ncaffeine levels up, we had knitting and crochet masters to share their skills, all\namongst a relaxed atmosphere of chitchat whilst lounging on sofas! I for one\nused it as an opportune excuse to start the weekend early, with chilled-out,\nhappy vibes.\nKnitSock meets at least once a week in the same manner, only enriched with\nmore yarn, more patterns, more masters, more cake, and more music. Experts\nand beginners are very welcome; we teach and chat and laugh for freeeeee!\nEmail knit.sock@imperial.ac.uk to join our mailing list!\nFinally, a huge thank you to Fairtrade Society, and especially Fang He, for all\nthe help in making the event such a success! See you soon, knitsters!\nNot yarning afterwards\nIt\u2019s an age old tradition to marry cheese and wine that the Cheese\nSociety are excited to present along with the Fairtrade Society!\nWe\u2019ve been in talks for a few years now about this event, so it feels\ngood to finally join forces in this wonderful culmination of a fortnight of activities, dedicated to promoting a fairer vision of world\ntrade. Our Cheese and Wine night will be all about just that, Fairtrade wines and complimentary cheese, picked to bring out the\ncomplex aromas and flavours to tickle your palette, along\nwith some complimentary condiments such as olives, grapes,\nnuts and strawberries.\nCome on down to Bar\nRCM to join us in ending\nthis Fairtrade Fortnight\nwith a cheesy bang. Carpe\nCaesum.\nA cheesy night...\nJustine Dattani\nYing Gu\nule, prompting bemused mutterings\nfrom the more cynical among us.\nOn to Wednesday, and a free tea\nand chocolate event organised with\nthe delightful Tea Society. his event\nwould see the arrival of special guests\nall the way from Ghana \u2013 cocoa farmers brought over by Divine Chocolate,\nwho had provided a wide selection of\ntheir \ufb02avours for those present. Along\nwith the mouth-watering variety of\ntastes on o\ufb00er (white chocolate and\nstrawberry, dark chocolate and ginger\nand hazelnut milk among others) we\nhad soothing teas courtesy of Qi; in a\nword, heaven.\nCoincidentally, it happened to be\nGhana\u2019s Independence Day, which\nseemed appropriate as the farmers\nproceeded to educate us as to how the\nFairtrade movement had given their\nfarming cooperative a certain amount\nof liberation from the market power of\nnational product distribution associations and MNC\u2019s alike, especially for\nthem as women (doubly relevant given\ntoday is International Women\u2019s Day).\nIn a generation where we as consumers are becoming increasingly insulated from the realities of food produc-tion, it was enlightening to see these\nhighly empowered people cut through\nmany of the myths that detractors of\nFairtrade propagate prodigiously. Divine themselves are 45% owned by the\nGhanaian Kuapa Kokoo cooperative,\nand have been pioneering this business model with great success, putting\npaid to the fallacy that Fairtrade does\nnothing more than allow companies\nto whack on an extra markup on prod-ucts. Although no one pretends that\nthe movement is perfect as it is and\nrequires little improvement, few critics actually o\ufb00er a constructive, intellectual critique of the Fairtrade movement \u2013 and even less dare to mention\nthe fact that protectionist strategies\nby governments in developed countries undermine any other e\ufb00orts to\nimprove farmers\u2019 conditions by hampering their ability to trade freely with\nmore privileged nations.\nOur stomachs were \ufb01lled by our\nrather unorthodox \u2018lunch\u2019 of sorts,\nand our eyes were opened by the stunningly short talk. If only College lecturers were this skilled at delivering\ncritical information in a concise and\ncomprehensible manner in under 20\nminutes. With that done, it was time\nto start preparing for the piece de re-sistance. Bringing together the sister\ninstitutions of Imperial and the Royal\nCollege of Music, and in association\nwith our muy buenos amigos/excel-lents amis/ from Cheese Society,\nwe are hosting a Cheese and Wine\nTasting night in baRCM tonight from\n19:30 onwards. With Fairtrade wines\nand delicious cheeses to tempt the\nmost hardnosed of connosieurs, it is\nsure to be the perfect way to end Fairtrade Fortnight.\n\n"

Their main aim should be making you turn that frown upside down. They represent students\u2019 welfare\nneeds to College and external organisations, and sit on a number of College committees relating to welfare, accommodation, equal opportunities and the student experience. They are also responsible for the activities of the Union\u2019s Community Action Group and IC RAG.\nFour years into my degree, I\u2019ve seen\na lot of what Imperial can throw at\nyou and my year abroad has given me\nanother perspective on the workings\nof a students\u2019 union.

After a rousing rendition of the national anthem by our\nresident Canadian operatic Trent Allen, the game started in earnest when\nbarely a minute into play the Devils\nfound themselves on the penalty kill\n(PK) after Rich Barlow threw a robust\nhit that sent the UCL player into the\nboards but was deemed interference.\nhe Yetis failed to capitalise on their\nman advantage, a constant theme\nthroughout the game, and the Devils quickly went a goal up when Paul\nHalford pounced on a loose puck\ncoughed up by their goalie following a stinging shot from Dan Belair.\nOnce both teams got settled, the Devils scored two more in quick succession with some silky stick handling by\nheo Sion and a laser beam of a shot\nfrom Gus Zimmerman. he momentum of the three goal advantage was\nsomewhat dampened when the Yetis\nwent on a 4v3 power play after Ryan\nRitchie took exception to the Yetis\ngiving it the handbags with our captain Dan and ended up in the penalty\nbox for his e\ufb00orts. Following another\ndubious interference call against the\nDevils, the Yetis reduced the de\ufb01cit\nto two but it was short lived as Dan\nconverted on a beautiful pass from\ndeep in our zone by Kurt Kolb. he\nDevils were made to pay for their\ncomplacency, however, when the Yetis\nnational league player found himself\non a 1 on 0 and \ufb01red a slap-shot into\nthe top-shelf to leave the game \ufb01nely\npoised at 4-2 after the \ufb01rst period.\nhe \ufb01rst half of the second period\nwas a cagey a\ufb00air with lots of hits but\nfew clear chances until a defensive\nlapse let the Yetis close the lead to a\nsingle goal. he Devils were unable to\nrespond immediately, \ufb01nding themselves on a series of PKs after DPFS\nStefan Nubert earned a double shift\nin the penalty box settling a disagreement over a neck-high check from\nthe opposition. But respond they did,\nwhen Captain Dan substantiated his\ntitle not once but twice, decking the\nYetis defence out of their jockstraps\nand e\ufb00ortlessly sliding the puck past\nthe hapless Yetis keeper. he completion of Dan\u2019s hat-trick restored the\nthree goal advantage leaving it 6-3 going into the third and \ufb01nal period.\nAny hopes the Yetis had of getting\nback into the game were quickly put\nto bed at the start of the third when\nPaul one-timed a beautiful snap-shot\no\ufb00 a perfectly weighted pass from\nRyan. he increasingly desperate Yetis\nwere kept at bay by a ridiculous number of unbelievable saves from our\ngoalie Marco Hafner and some physical play that lead to our penalty box\nlooking like a second team bench. he\ngame ended in a convincing 7-3 victory and a thoroughly deserved man of\nthe match went to Marco, who robbed\nthe Yetis forwards so many times that\nonly a bricked-up goalmouth could\nhave kept more out. he crushing victory was rapturously received by the\nImperial section of the 250 strong\ncapacity crowd that transformed the\non-ice battle into a full-scale grudge\nmatch, providing the most memorable of hockey games for all those in-volved.\nIf you missed out on the London Ice\nVarsity you can see the mighty Imperial Devils take on their other derby rivals the London Dragons in their \ufb01nal\ngame of the season on Saturday 10th\nMarch. Face o\ufb00 is at 9pm at Brixton\nIce Arena (a couple mins walk from\nBrixton Underground station on the\nVictoria line) and it\u2019s completely free\nto watch and will be \ufb01nished before\nthe last tube. Expect a lot of goals and\nhuge hits, following the Devils\u2019 Varsity\nsuccess they are looking to put more\npast the Dragons than the 16-2 drubbing on the previous outing of the two\nteams. Email ice-hockey@imperial.\nac.uk for more information about the\ngame or learning to play ice hockey.\nPassionate about her sport, Nancy has led the netball club from\nstrength to strength this year; with\nincreased membership, more socials and coming so close to pro-motion. Despite the difficulties of a\nplague of injuries and sponsorship\nwoes, ICUNC has had a good year\neven with potential wins at Varsity\nto look forward to.\n\u201cMembership has gone up again\nthis year; which is a good thing\nconsidering the difficulties of injuries we\u2019ve had. We lost key players across four teams which really\nstretched us and undoubtedly affected out promotion chances\u201d\nIndeed the story of their current\nleague standings (3rd, 4th and 5th\nfor their 1st 2nd and 3rd teams\nrespectively) looked completely\ndifferent before Christmas, with\nthe 2\u2019s having only lost one league\ngame, and all three teams pushing on to gain the coveted top spot\nwhich guarantees promotion, but\nunfortunately it was not to be. Now\nthat promotion has all but slipped\nthrough their fingers ICUNC\u2019s attention turns to Varsity.\n\u201cI think we\u2019ve got a very good\nchance against the Medics. The 2s\nwon last year and the 3s, while they\ncame so close last year have already\nbeaten the Medics 3s this season.\nWe\u2019re also looking to enter a fourth\nteam into BUCS this year. We already run two LUSL teams, so it\nshould be a pretty smooth step up.\u201d\nThe reception to LUSL, the new\nsports league to replace the ULU\nleagues, has been completely mixed.\nFootball, hockey and netball have\nslipped into the new system seam-lessly, while hardly a game has been\nplayed in the rugby leagues. Certainly netball, with five competing\nteams have switched without dra-ma.\n\u201cLUSL has been really good for\nall our teams. While some of the\nleagues aren\u2019t quite right yet as they\nare new and some teams are too high\nor low, UCL 3rds have won 9/9 with\na goal difference of 267 for example,\nover the next couple of seasons of\npromotion and relegation will level\nthem out. It\u2019s great because it gives\nus a chance to experience different styles of play and play different\nteams to the BUCS leagues.\u201d\nNot only has Nancy\u2019s reign been a\nsuccess on the court (she personally\nhas moved up two teams this year),\nit has been a huge success off it,\nwith the socials going from strength\nto strength.\n\u201cNetball Funday is bigger and better than last years, we\u2019re expecting\nover 100 people and as it\u2019s on St.\nPatricks day there\u2019ll probably be a\nfew drinks involved too\u201d\nFor those not in the know, Funday\nis a fun informal netball tournament\nbeing held at South Parks in Fulham.\nPlayed in fancy dress with teams of\n7-10 people, BYOB and open to all\nabilities, tickets are \u00a320 per team\nand available from the netball website (www.icunc.co.uk) or from the\nJCR on Monday lunchtime.\n\u201cAnother big social we have is a\nclub night at Piccadilly institute on\nThursday the 21st of March. It\u2019ll be\n\u00a35 in, \u00a39 for a jug of cocktail and full\nof Netballers \u2018fresh\u2019 from Annual\ndinner.\u201d\nWith a couple of huge social nights\ncoming up, potential wins at Varsity\nand an increase in numbers ICUNC\nis finishing the season strong.\nSee you at Funday!\nOli Benton Sports Editor\nNetball\u2019s season: highs lows and Funday!\nICUNC President Nancy Edge reflects on her season\n\n"

And in order for this\nunlikely alliance to become a believable one, there needs to be careful\nplanning, both in terms of charac-terisation, as well as the plot that will\neventually connect the two.\nDirector Eran Creevy, in his second\nouting behind the cameras after his\nBAFTA-nominated Shifty (very highly recommended), is in some ways\nsuccessful in paying tribute to some\nof the best \ufb01lms of this particular\ngenre. In an almost Heat-esque style\nand dynamic between his hero and\nvillain, he attempts to create strong\nand stable core central players, as\nwell as surrounding in a murky con-spiracy-driven plot set in the parts of\nLondon you don\u2019t get to see in many\n\ufb01lms set in the capital.\nhree years after his leg is shot by\nJacob Sternwood (Strong), a notorious criminal, Max Lewinsky (McA-voy) has since become a wounded\nman, both physically and mentally.\nHe no longer shows the passion or\nenthusiasm he once had, and goes\nabout his everyday job without exactly having his head in the game, to\nmuch disappointment from his eager\npartner, Sarah Hawks (Riseborough).\nBut he is faced with one last chance\nto face o\ufb00 with the man who has permanently scarred him for life. Jacob\u2019s\nson, Ruan (Elyes Gabel) ends up in\na hospital in critical condition after\ntaking a bullet. Convinced that Jacob will return from hiding to see his\nown son, Max works closely with the\ncase, always trying to outsmart his\nnemesis, determined now more than\never to put him behind bars.\nMax is a flawed individual who\nwould never admit his shortcoming.\nHis leg injury always seems to be\ngetting in the way, but what makes\nhim stand out is his undying sense\nof duty, in part driven by revenge to\ntake down the bad guy. Even in the\n\ufb01lm\u2019s opening where four motorbikes\nare chased by Max\u2019s car in the dead\nof night in Canary Wharf, his relentless pursuit is what explosively kicks\neverything o\ufb00. And McAvoy has that\nbeaming intensity to create a hero\nworth rooting for.\nStrong has never had a problem\nplaying the villain but here he has a\nslightly more layered role to play, as\nbehind that tough, hardened exterior\nlies a genuinely worried father showing his softer sides, even for the briefest of moments.\nBut despite the actors\u2019 best ef-forts, however, the \ufb01lm never spends\nenough time into looking at their relationships in adequate detail. here\nis very little background story to explain their drive and motivation. he\nonly other clich\u00e9d element missing\nfrom McAvoy\u2019s character is that he\u2019s\nlacking a bottle of alcohol, and with\nStrong, the lazy reference to the villain\u2019s wife poses questions and intrigue whilst never going back to address it later. Riseborough\u2019s character\nis entirely wasted here \u2013 she has great\nchemistry with McAvoy, and the\nwordplay between the two is great\nfun to watch, which is why it\u2019s such a\nshame to see her amount to very little\nwhen it comes to the overall plot.\nA lot was left on the cutting room\nfloor it seems, as Creevy wanted the\n\u201cpresent-day\u201d action to speak for itself with its tight running time to\npack in the tension but when it comes\nto actually understanding the char-acters, the script quickly glosses over\nthem, wanting to get on with its main\nforte, the action scenes.\nBudgeted at a modest production\nvalue of 8.5 million dollars, don\u2019t go\nin expecting to see lots of explosions\nand big-scale gun \ufb01ghts. Instead what\nyou get are skilfully mounted, intensely shot and patiently \ufb01lmed se-quences, often a whole lot more e\ufb00ective than having far too much money\nto spend. With its \u201cless is more\u201d ap-proach, the \ufb01lm does \ufb01nd assured\nfooting with handling the kinetic\naction, always managing to keep the\nslick style intact despite the relatively\nmodest scale.\nhe overall achievement is a satisfying one, but you get the feeling\nthat it could easily have been better,\nwith a little more attention paid to its\ncharacters. Perhaps a director\u2019s cut\nedition would be worth a look.\nThe Three Performances to watch\nBrighton Rock (2010) W.E. (2011) Shadow Dancer (2012)\n\n"

It\nseems to just keep com-ing: \ufb01rst Acton, then the\nmurmurs of a potential shut down of\nthe Translation Studies Unit, and now\nGarden Hall. I suspect these are clever\ntactics by College, releasing the supposed solution before the proposed\nclosure, in dribs and drabs as term and\ntiredness ensues. Understandably any\ninnovative institution must cut at the\ndeadwood; but this is hacking away at\nthe green branches.\nGarden Hall is the place known for\nthree students bunking to a room; it\nis no biggie, and \u00a370 a room for South\nKensington is not half bad. After all,\nsuch options in current times are an\nincreasing economic reality for many.\nhis hall helps provide an opportunity\nfor students from a range of socio-eco-nomic backgrounds. Garden Hall provides a foot in the doorway for a few of\nthe masses to get in. Why else bother\ntouring our state-schooled children\naround the innards of our education\nsystem, if not to provide them with\nsuch tempting carrots later on? In fact,\nit is plain darn cruel dangling this hidden world in front of their noses and\nmaking the getting there tougher and\ntougher. For Pete\u2019s sake, the obstacle\ncourses of educational di\ufb00erences\nand tuition fees are already enough to\ncontend with, without adding another\nhurdle. Of course, in our Imperial College London family, we do not give two\nhoots about social mobility. We prefer\nto collectively spend money on bottled\nwater, left on heating/appliances and\non repeatedly replacing our manicured\nQueen\u2019s turf. We want to shun our\nloveable, benevolent aunt of a building.\nGarden Hall is charm incarnate; although this is not in itself a reason to\nkeep a building, there is always a certain need for aesthetic pleasures. Not\nmany student halls are a Grade II listed\nbuilding and have patterned, dreamy\nceilings or a wooden lounge. All of this\ngives a certain je ne sais quoi; it is our\neccentric aunt amongst the Prince\u2019s\nGardens halls. She is after all what\nstudents want, as evidenced by the\nromanticism linked to the campuses\nof Oxbridge, Durham and St. Andrews. For goodness\u2019 sake, if we need\nmore rooms, why not just buy another\nbuilding somewhere nearby and keep\nour auntie. But of course I forget: it appears this is not for Imperial College\nLondon; we prefer sterile, distant, Soviet spring-ups like Orient House.\nGarden consistently tops satisfaction\nand demand \u2013 never an empty room\n\u2013 and besides that, it ful\ufb01ls all the criteria in Imperial College\u2019s accommodation strategy. hese shared rooms\nright by our lecture halls give a loose\nsense of cohesion, student feel and create a campus feeling. Although many\nof the rooms are shared, students have\nthe luxury of having pool, library and\ncampus on their doorstep, which more\nthan compensates for any inconven-ience. Speaking of inconveniences,\ntake a moment and put all of this into\nperspective; in Romania for instance,\nstudent holes lack proper shower or\ntoilet \ufb01xtures. his is not saying we\nought to deliberately su\ufb00er without\nproper \ufb01xtures, but we should have\nsome realism. But no, I forgot: we at\nImperial College London do not want\nto give luxuries for the few who have\nto bunk it out in shared rooms. No, we\ndon\u2019t want to have the slight treats our\neccentric aunt gives us.\nI believe that Garden Halls will go.\nJust like the majority of changes across\ncampus, much of the student body appear oblivious; self-absorbed and preoccupied with deadlines, holidays and\nchipped nail woes. Without art stu-dents, this university lacks the words\nto keep the balance in check. Our pre-enlightenment Buddha-like student\nbody will not do enough; I am not sure\nthe word \u2018protest\u2019 is even in their lexi-con. If our students cannot even get us\nto creep up the green league from our\nbottom position, what hope is there\nfor anything else? Imperial College\nLondon is an odd place: our brightest\nminds churn out leading energy policies and research but cannot even keep\ntheir own heating in check.\nA person or an institution must be\njudged by its actions. Imperial College\u2019s actions appear to point towards\na lack of commitment towards providing a range of doorstep accommoda-tion, keeping academia broad (at least\nlinguistically) and keeping with energy\nstandards. All of this is laughable at a\nworld leading institution, which deigns\nto compete with Oxbridge and the Ivy\nLeague. I may be wrong with this ar-ticle; perhaps there are better replacements being devised which take social\nmobility into account, but they do not\nappear evident as of yet. Let us wait\nwith bated breath and crossed \ufb01ngers,\nbut I for one am not getting my hopes\nup.\nTo sign the petition to save Garden Hall\nvisit http://www.change.org/en-GB/pe-titions/imperial-college-save-garden-hall\nT\nOnline\n\u201d\n\u00a370 a room\nfor South\nKensington is\nnot half bad\n... and an increasing economic reality\nfor many\nIn response to \u201cAnger Over New\nHalls\u201d (22nd February)\nReally, really angry about this. I had a\nfantastic time in Garden in \ufb01rst year\nand it\u2019d be an absolute travesty if it was\nto close.\nBesides, I stayed in a triple room for\njust under \u00a370 a week, which was ace,\nat least for my bank account.\nNow options like this are systematically being stripped away to feed dollar\nback to he Man and the production of\nmore JCR baguettes. Probably.\n\u201cWe want to engage with students to\n\ufb01nd out what they would like to see\nthere.\n\u201d\nOh wow. Just like you \u201cengaged\u201d in\nasking us if we actually want halls there.\nCampus Services and College Council\nshould be ashamed of themselves. hey\nhave managed to close down Wilson,\nClayponds, the Holland Club and now\nthis. If there is a prize for the worst student support the campus services director should get it. If the College ever call\nme up asking me for money for the rest\nof my life I will tell them where can go!\n\u201cHarding-Roots said that \u201caffordable\nrents\u201d were the \u201cmain focus.\n\u201d He said\nthat College needed a \u201cbalanced portfo-lio, including lower band rooms, which\nare under \u00a3150 per week.\n\u201d\nHarding-Roots is also living in a\ndream world. Does he think \u00a3150/week\nis *cheap*? When I was in halls I paid\njust under \u00a3100/week and even that\ncompletely consumed my student loan.\nClose and cheap, but not at such a\nhigh speci\ufb01cation. If you want luxury,\ngo private.\nhe rector has a bigass house, let\u2019s just\nmove in with him.\n---In response to \u201cSoap Opera Acton\u201d\n(1st March)\nI entirely agree that College should keep\nEvelyn Gardens open until the end of\nthe lease. he halls are not in particularly bad condition (with the exception\nof Fisher), and would therefore not need\na massive amount of investment over\nthe next 32 years.\nYour argument regarding the lease\nextension is, however, misguided. Indeed, the way a leasehold typically\nworks is that you pay a large amount\nof money upfront to purchase the lease-hold, every year you pay ground rent\n(which is set at the time of the purchase,\nand normally doesn\u2019t increase much/\nat all after that), and at the end of the\nlease, you\u2019re left with nothing.\nBecause the ground rent will have\nbeen set many decades ago, College\ncould be paying ground rent of a few\nhundred pounds per year (essentially\nnothing). You claim that College could\neasily negotiate an extension of the\nlease, and I\u2019m sure that\u2019s true, but the\ncosts would be staggering: given the\nlocation, we\u2019re talking 8-9 \ufb01gures for a\nreasonable extension.\n---In response to \u201chere is Something\nin the Air\u201d (1st March)\nA very interesting piece Merry. Something as a non smoker which I object\nto is having to inhale a cloud of smoke\nwhen I walk past your fraternity to enter various buildings around college. If\nthe college provided bins and so on just\na few metres away from doors and thor-oughfares, would you begrudge using\nthem?\nI really hate smoking and wish people\ndidn\u2019t smoke...\nhat being said, its someone\u2019s personal choice to smoke and it isn\u2019t my job\n(or anyone else\u2019s) to really pass judgement or try to enforce any restriction\non someone smoking beyond that of the\nlaw and common sense. Its the responsibility of the smoker to stop smoking...\nnot the majority nor the college.\nLike it or not, people do smoke, and\nnot having provisions for it or attempting to deny it happens creates more\nproblems than it ever solves. his is regardless of what the majority\u2019s stance on\nsmoking actually is.\nPeople should get off their moral\nsoapboxes; If this was a restriction on\nfatty foods or alcohol then there\u2019d be a\ndifferent response to this article.\nI hate cigarettes and smoking. But I\nhate restrictions on a person\u2019s freedom\nof choice far far more...\n\n"

He dedicated his\nlife to observing and documenting the\ncultural evolution of generations: from\nthe flower children in the Sheep Meadows of Central Park in the 1960s to the\nsartorial butterflies of fashion week and\nAnna Wintour, who says, \u2018We all get\ndressed for Bill.\u2019\nDiana Vreeland (pictured), one of\nfashion\u2019s most formidable and notorious mavericks, was the fashion editor\nof Harper\u2019s Bazaar from 1936-62, powerhouse editor-in-chief at Vogue from\n\u201863-71 and consultant to New York\u2019s\nCostume Institute at the Metropolitan\nMuseum of Art. She is immortalised in\nhe Eye Has To Travel, a glorious patchwork of twentieth-century history and\nculture sewn together with the silken\nthread of one remarkable woman\u2019s life.\nWhat she, and the others mentioned,\nhave in common is an uncompromis-ing, unwavering belief that their vision\nis one worth portraying, and continue to\ndrive it forward for as long as they can\nbreathe and dream. his, in my eyes, is\nthe hallmark of not only an artist, but a\nlife well lived.\nInspiration is a glimpse of a connection that comes from within you, and\nbridges to the world outside of your\nimagination. Finding it, and more than\nthat, hearing it and acting upon it promises both a most frightening prospect\nand a most bountiful reward. he people in these three short \ufb01lms are infused\nwith inspiration; their careers and their\nlives\u2019 work were ful\ufb01lling to an extent\nthat right now is a distant dream to me. I\ndon\u2019t have a destination yet, but aimless\ngoal-seeking is not an option either. I\u2019m\nconvinced there\u2019s something that can\nignite even this most weary, disa\ufb00ected\nsoul. Laurels were meant to be worn as a\ncrown, not to be rested upon.\nThe type of\ninspiration I\u2019m\ntalking about\nisn\u2019t laying in\nwait at a\ncareers fair.\nNeeds more red\n\n"

For people\nused to setting their own schedules,\nto blazing a bit of a trail, to grabbing\nthe talented people around them to\nembark on a creative project, it can\nfeel like a bit like hem Days Are Ending. It\u2019s time to settle down, get a Real\nJob, and accept the inevitability of the\ncorporate grind. Helpful, that\u2019s absolutely untrue.\nWith the current boom in creative\nand tech startups, it\u2019s a very exciting\ntime for young, ambitious graduates.\nInspiring, small and innovative companies are popping up all over the\nUK, and as their ideas come to frui-tion, they are looking increasingly to\nspirited graduates to join their teams\nand create the superpowers of tomorrow.\nSo what\u2019s the di\ufb00erence between working for a startup and\na larger, more established company?\nFor a start, it\u2019s about\nculture. In a company\nwhere hierarchy, roles\nand skillsets have\nyet to be\nfirmly\nT\n\u201d\n...it\u2019s a very\nexciting time\nfor young,\nambitious\ngraduates\nestablished (or indeed, will never\nbe), it\u2019s an amazing opportunity for\na graduate to stretch their skills and\ntalents across a lot of di\ufb00erent areas.\nUpon arriving, every member of the\nteam is expected to help steer the\ncompany to success \u2013 the likelihood\nof you photocopying and making tea\nfor six months is pretty unlikely. Of\ncourse, such an prospect won\u2019t be\nfor everyone, but for those hungry to\nlearn, to develop and to help something they believe in grow, it\u2019s di\ufb03cult\nto see why they\u2019d want to choose any\nother path. Without old fashioned\nideas or rules and regulations passed\ndown through generations of jargon,\nthese start-ups are lean, technologically aware and determined not to fall\ninto the kind of patterns that make\nhe Working Day famously unattrac-tive.\nSo how do eminently talented graduates and students make themselves\nattractive to these potential employ-ers? To be honest, it\u2019s pretty straight-forward: prove that you are someone\nwho does things. From making short\n\ufb01lms with your friends to setting up\na debating society, from organising a weekly music event to creating\na hangover sandwich stall \u2013 these\nemployers want solid evidence that\nyou\u2019re as self-starting as they are.\nGetting involved with the upcoming\nVenture Catalyst Challenge \u2013 a competition for Imperial students to turn\na great tech idea into a commercial\nsuccess - is a fantastic way to\nstretch your entrepreneurial wings, and it\u2019s worthwhile checking out sites\nsuch as enternships.\ncom, who specialise in\nconnecting talented\ngraduates with entrepreneurial startups\nand SME\u2019s.\nAs you count down\nyour university days,\ndon\u2019t for a second think\nthat the adventure has to\nstop here. If you know that\nyou don\u2019t belong in a cubicle,\nor in a suit, feel free to\njoin those who feel\nthe same.\nDON\u2019T WASTE THIS SPACE! WRITE FOR FELIX\nEmail: felix@imperial.ac.uk\n\n"

Evidently Garden Hall\nmeets spectacularly all the above.\u201d\nhe petition states that Garden Hall\nis popular amongst students and is\nalways in demand as there are never\nempty rooms and it is always oversub-scribed. Imperial College Union have\ncon\ufb01rmed that it is the most oversub-scribed hall at Imperial.\nhe students have made signs and\nposters and stuck them up in their\nrooms and around campus. here\nare big \u201cSOS\u201d letters in the windows\nof the rooms and kitchens, and there\nare many \u201cSave Garden Hall\u201d posters\nvisible from the outside. he atmosphere at the hall while taking a photo\nof students outside was one of worry,\nuncertainty, anger, and general confusion over any potential closure of\nGarden. Students were motivated and\ndetermined to make their views heard\nby College.\nSpeaking outside Garden, Union\nPresident, Paul Beaumont, said: \u201cIt\u2019s\nwonderful to see so many students\nbeing vocal, especially because they\nwon\u2019t actually be here when Garden\ncloses, so it\u2019s great to see so many\npeople looking out for the welfare of\nfuture students\u201d. Temi Ladega, CGCU\nPresident, said that he was \u201cextremely\ndisappointed with what College are\ndoing\u201d. He went on to say: \u201cI think it\u2019s\ntime that College start caring about\nstudents and not just their \ufb01nances\u201d.\nMany of the Garden residents expressed their dismay as well. Tim\nLam, a 1st year, said, \u201cthe possible closure of Garden Hall makes me feel like\nImperial doesn\u2019t care about students\nat all and makes me think that maybe\nthe people in charge are just money\ndriven\u201d. Rebecca Rove, a 3rd year hall\nsenior, said that the location and price\nwere key. She said that it allowed her\nto participate more in university life\nthan she could if she were further\naway. She went on to say, \u201cIf cheap\nrooms were not available in my \ufb01rst\nyear I would not have chosen to come\nto Imperial\u201d.\nGarden Hall is in a listed building\nand is the most oversubscribed hall;\nit houses 84 students in a mixture\nof single, double and triple rooms.\nhese rooms form some of the cheapest accommodation options on o\ufb00er\nat Imperial. It recently emerged that\nthere is the possibility of it closing to\nbecome o\ufb03ce space or anything else\nneeded. he reason given is that space\nis tight on the South Kensington cam-pus. It was claimed that the hall is in\nneed of refurbishing and is not in a\ngood state. he students living there,\nhowever, seem to be happy enough\nwith it. he petition closes with the\nfollowing plea: \u201cPlease return student\npriorities to the centre, keep Garden\nHall and invest in this important\nspace. his will mean a great deal to\nstudents and sta\ufb00.\u201d\nIt is known that College are going\nto be discussing Garden Hall and its\nfuture on 20 March. his meeting will\nbe one of the Management Board\u2019s\nregular meetings. he Management\nBoard is one of the most senior boards\nin College and is chaired by the President & Rector. he Union have requested to be allowed to attend this\nto allow their point of view to be put\nforward. he Union have sent a letter\nto the President & Rector. At time of\ngoing to print, they have not received\na reply.\nhe protest comes in the wake of the\nnews about new halls being planned\nin Acton, which was denounced by\nmany students due to distance and\ncost. here is also the possibility that\nthe halls in Evelyn Gardens could be\nclosed as the lease has just over 30\nyears left on it, and the negotiations\nwith the Wellcome Trust, who own\nthe lease, appear to reportedly indicate that they are not willing to extend\nthe lease. he College, at the minute,\nseem unwilling to renovate the halls\nunless there is an extension. he lease\nwill be worth less and less as it gets\ncloser to the end.\nPrice, proximity, and poorer students being priced out of nearby halls highlighted\nManagement Board\nto meet and discuss\nUnion\u2019s 5 requests\nWidespread dismay\nat possible closure of\nGarden\nGarden houses\ncheap rooms close to\ncampus\nEditorial page 2\nComment: page 41\n>>\n>>\nStudents get ready to hold up signs.\nThe windows show the Save Garden\nposters\nStudents get their\narts and crafts on\n\n"
