    "content": "STUDENT HARDSHIP RISING\nIt is evident from the number\nof students using the Union\nAdvice service that student\nfinancial hardship is continuing to increase . There are\nmany examples of students\nworking long hours for low\nwages and others who have\nnot eaten for several days in\norder to pay essential bills\nsuch as rent and fuel bills.\nThe budget at the end of\n1994 was not good news for\nstudents. Gillian Shepherd,\nSecretary of State for\nEducation, revealed that institutions will have to make an\nalmost 3.5% financial cut on\neach person as student\nnumbers rise. The rates for\ngrants will be reduced by 8%\nwhich will result in more\nstudents having to rely on\nloans.\nMature students will be badly\naffected by the abolishment\nof the allowance received by\nstudents over twenty six. All in all, funding for higher\neducation is to be cut by \u00a325\nmillion in each of the next\ntwo academic years and will\ncontinue at the new reduced\nfigure into 1997/8. To make\nmatters worse students are\nfacing long delays in having\ntheir applications processed\nfor a student loan .\nWhile looking at the financial\nproblems faced by home\nstudents, wc should\nremember that international\nstudents outside the EEC do\nnot receive Local Education\nAuthority grants and cannot\napply for student loans.\nThere are discussions taking\nplace which consider ways in\nwhich students can pay for\ntheir education. Recent suggestions include the idea of\nstudents repaying maintenance and pos s ii bly fee costs\nthrough national insurance\nand tax. This added burden\nwould be very worrying\nwhen most students already\nface having to repay student\nloans and large debts when\nthey leave college. It is\nthought that 18 to 21 year old\nstudents are accumulating\ndebts over \u00a32,000 and it is\npossible that older students\nmay run debts up to \u00a36,000. It\nis possible that the growing\nfinancial pressures may discourage people from poorer\nbackgrounds from embarking\non higher education courses\nin the future.\nIt can be said that student\npoverty exists now and\nmeasures which may worsen\nthe situation should be strongly opposed. How can students who have to worry\nabout meeting their basic\nfinances be expected to cope\nwith the pressure of their\nstudies?\nIt may be possible for institutions to introduce schemes to\nassist students in financial\ndifficulty such as providing\ncheaper accommodation, cheaper meals,help with books and\ncheaper nursery places. Some\ncolleges have set up systems\nto waive or reduce fees in\ncases of extreme hardship.\nCurrent provisions such as the\naccess and hardship trust have\nhelped many students to cope\nwith the pressures that financial hardship brings.\nThe start of a new academic\nyear can surely be the most\nstressful time of the year for\nmany students. This article is\nintended to highlight some of\nthe financial problems which\ncan increase the pressure on\nstudents.\nIf you are experiencing\nfinancial difficulties, seek\nadvice from the Union\nAdviser.\nIs Your Gas A Killer?\nCarbon monoxide poisoning\nfrom faulty gas heaters\nposes a real threat to us all.\nApproximately 30 or 40\ndeaths occur in this way\nevery year and students are\noften the victims.\nCarbon monoxide is difficult to detect as it cannot be\nseen and does not necessarily smell.There arc, however,\na few danger signs to lookout for, such as stains at the\ntop of a gas heater or a yel-low/orange flame.\nBut the best way of ensuring\nyour appliance is safe, is to\nhave it checked by a qualified person ( CO.R.G.I. REGISTERED). The good news is that from\n31st October 1994, land-lords/ladies have a legal\nresponsibility to ensure that\ngas appliances are checked\nevery 12 months. They have\nto keep an inspection record\nwhich must be made available to students. A gas safety action line has been set up\nto provide information.\nThey can be contacted by-phoning (free phone)0800300363. All in all, these changes may\nhelp students to protect\nthemselves against unnec es sar v death.\nIf you are in any\ncan seek ad vict Union Adviser.\nyou\nthe\nThis edition of the advice\noffice newsletter has been\nproduced with the help of\nMark H., Andy T,& Jackie\nCummins.\nThe Advice\nCentre DO YOU NEED\nFREE\nAND\nCONFIDENTIAL\nADVICE ?\nFOR ADVICE\nON ALL\nASPECTS OF\nLIFE\nCONTACT THE\nADVICE\nCENTRE.\nAPPOINTMENTS\nCAN BE MADE AT\nTHE UNION OFFICE\nOR BY PHONING\n0 1 7 1 5 9 4 8 0 6 0 .\nA WIDE RANGE OF\nFREE LEAFLETS\nARE AVAILABLE\nFROM THE\nUNION OFFICE.\niCU IMPERIAL COLLEGE UNION\n\n"

    "content": "News in brief\nTWO . FELIX FRIDAY OCTOBER 6TH1995 Fire Officer:\nAlarms are Fine\nBY ANDY SINH ARAYA burning dust sheet, apparently\nleft by contractors, almost\ncaused a serious fire in Garden\nHall during September. With the\nmain entrance to the hall filled\nwith smoke, a female security\nguard managed to put out the\nflames using two fire\nextinguishers.\nSpeculation that the fire was\nstarted by a burning cigarette\nbutt, dropped by one of the hall's summer residents, is\nunconfirmed as the cause\nremains a mystery. With at least\none alarm not sounding a considerable number of residents\ndid not even attempt to exit the\nhall.\nSpeaking to Felix, Graham\nCox, Imperial College's Fire\nOfficer, played down the\nincident insisting that there was\nno real blaze as such. \"Dust\nsheets do not readily burn ... it's unlikely that it would have done\nanything,\" he said.\nMr Cox further asserted\nthat a sub warden had attempted\nto extinguish the sheet before\nalerting security. The fire, which\noccurred in the early hours of 15\nSeptember did not result in any\ninjuries, and following the\nactivation of the alarms the Hall\nwas promptly cleared, Mr Cox\nHizb ut Tahrir continued from\npage 1\nby embracing an Islamic way of\nlife, especially in Britain, where\nthey claimed the political system\nmerely offers \"capitalism and\nmore capitalism\".\nIn response in an incident\nwhere Hizb-ut-Tahrir students\nreportedly \"sat in\" on a meeting\nof Kings College London's Jewish\nSociety, they said that Muslims\nshould have the right to listen to\nother ideologies. They also said\nthat they were quite prepared to\ngo on the record and account for\ninsists.\nIn view of the over-activity\nof the Linstead Fire Alarms, the\nFire Officer stressed that he had\nno concern over the system's reliability. In contrast it has been\nsuggested to Felix that Security\nhad no knowledge of the fire\nuntil alerted by a Garden Hall\nresident\nMr Cox said that the\nmajority of these alarms were\ncaused by students tampering\nwith the system or by\ninadvertently exposing detectors\nto cooking fumes.\nThe Fire Officer went on to\nindicate that similar systems are\nwidely used in hotels, \"and there\nhasn't been a fatality since the\nFire Precautions Act\". He\nattributed the excess of alarms in\nthe halls of residences to the\npositioning and relatively high\nnumber of kitchen facilities in\nstudent buildings.\nThe contractors, to whom\nthe burning dust sheets\nbelonged, have now finished\ntheir work in Garden Hall.\nMr Cox said though that in\nfuture such items would have to\nbe locked away when not in use\nto reduce any fire risk, though\nwhy regulations to such effect\ndid not previously exit remains\nunclear.\nsome of their negative publicity,\nalso claiming that their campaign\nwas being stifled by student\nunions like that of Imperial\nCollege.\nIn spite of their apparently\nmild publicity, Hizb-ut-Tahrir\nare well known for their\nextremist views. The Deputy\nPresident for Clubs & Societies,\nTim Townend, told Felix that\n\"they're a recognised terrorist\norganisation, banned from Arab\nstates... [and] banned from most\nuniversities.\" He added that last\nyear it was believed that they\nwere active in about 50\nBeit Moves\nAfter the months of confusion,\nImperial Estates are openly\ndiscussing their plans to move\nImperial College Union over to\nthe Sherfield building. Sarah\nWhite, ICU president, has been\ngiven a copy of the final\nfeasibility study undertaken by\narchitects Trout and MacAslan in\npreparation for a meeting with\nDirector of Estates Ian Caldwell\nnext week. \"I am delighted we\nare making some progress,\"\nSarah said, although she is still\nconcerned about the lack of\nstudent representation on the\ncrucial Building Committee.\nAndy Mourned\nAndrew Flanagan, who was ICU Bars Manager between 1991 and\n1993, died of AIDS this week.\nThere will be a service at\nGolders Green Crematorium at\n3pm this afternoon.\nC&S Break-in\nIt is still not known just how\nmuch has been lost in the theft\nfrom the clubs and societies\nstore room last month. The store\non the top floor of the union\nbuilding was broken into at some\nstage over the summer, but it is\nnot known exactly when. The\ndamage was only discovered\nwhen last year's ICU President\nLucy Chothia went back to\nreclaim some things she had left\nin the room over the summer.\nuniversities, but were strongest in\nLondon. \"They are really bad,\"he\nadded, citing newspaper reports\nof their anti-semitic, anti-democracy, extremist views and\ntheir support of anti-Israeli\nterrorist action. If they appeared\non campus again, he said, they\nwould have to removed for\ntrespassing, as happened on\nTuesday, though he conceded\nthat it was problematic for other\ncollege issues such as freedom of\nspeech.\nImperial College Union\nPresident Sarah White said that\nsimilar activity had taken place at\nWhile Lucy had not left anything\nparticularly valuable in the store,\nshe has lost a number of things of\nsentimental value, including her\nold rowing medals. As a number\nof different people have access to\nkeys to the store, it seems\nunlikely that ICU will be able to\nfind the culprit.\nFreshers' Full Up\nThe ICU Freshers' events have\nsold out every night this week,\nand there are no tickets left for\ntonight's carnival. Entertainments Manager Mark Home\ninsists that students without\ntickets should not turn up at the\nevent, as they will not be able to\nget in. He says he is 'delighted'\nwith the success of the events.\nThere have been a number\nof problems during the week: on\nMonday evening, the building\nhad to be evacuated when the\nfire alarms went off. Badly\nfunctioning vents meant that gas\nfrom the smoke machine\naccumulated at the top of the\nbuilding. On Wednesday even-ing, a window was broken in the\nUnion lounge. It is not known\nwho was responsible.\nErratum\nIn Felix 1034 we mistakenly\ndescribed the attempted suicide\nas being from the Mechanical\nEngineering department. He was\nin fact from the department of\nElectrical Engineering.\nthe fresher s' fair at University\nCollege London, and that there\nhad even been a bomb scare. One\nsource at UCL SU said the group\nhad \"been very disruptive and\nintimidating, and were harassing\nstudents\" and had been ignoring\npleas for them to stop. They were\nconsequently banned from the\nFreshers' Fair but proceeded to\ntake over the stalls of the Arab\nand Pakistani Societies. In the\nlight of these events, Sarah said\nthat there were now plans for a ULU-wide telephone support\nservice should such activity occur\nagain.\n\n"

A non-British spouse (or\ndependent) who is forbidden\nto work in the UK or claim\npublic funds and who lives\nwith a full-time student is\nexempt from paying the\ncouncil tax.\nThis amendment will be of\nparticular use to international\nstudents who have faced\ngreat difficulty paying the\ncouncil tax when they were\njoined by their family,\nespecially as council tax\nbenefit was included in the\nforbidden 'recourse to public\nfunds' rule.\nStudents needing further\nadvice or experiencing\nproblems should consult\nthe Adviser or UKCOSA.\nTelevision Licences\nIf you use a television, you\nneed a licence. You can\npurchase a licence from the\npost office. The cost of a colour television licence from\n1st April 1995 is \u00a386.50 and\nthe cost of a black and white\ntelevision licence is now\n\u00a328.50.\nYou need a colour licence if\nyou have a black and white\ntelevision connected to a video recorder.\nIt is a criminal offence to\nwatch a television without a licence and if found guilty,\nface a fine.\nThe bad news\nN.H.S charges increased in\nApril. Prescription charges\nfor medication will increase\nfrom \u00a34.75 to \u00a35.25 per item.\nThe good news\nStudents may be entitled to\nhelp with N.H.S. charges.\nThis will help to pay for\nN.H.S. prescriptions, N.H.S dental treatment, glasses and\nsight tests, N.H.S. wigs and\nfabric supports and travel to\nhospital for N.H.S. treatment.\nDriving\nLicences\nUKCOSA, an advisory\norganisation for international\nstudents have suggested that\ninternational students obtain a UK licence if they plan to\nremain in Britain for longer\nthan twelve months to avoid\nserious legal problems.\nThis may involve having to\ntake a UK driving test\ndepending on which national\nlicence is held.\nFurther information can be\nobtained from DVLA,\nSwansea, SA6 7J L. Details are available from the\nUnion Reception area.\nInternational students can\nalso claim help with N.H.S. charges without any effect on\nimmigration status as it does\nnot constitute 'recourse to\npublic funds'.\nYou can claim help with\nN.H.S. charges by completing\nform AG1.

REPLIED TO THIS WEEK BY RAC I IEL WALTERS Conservative perspective\nEditor:\nIn response to your report of last\nweek on our web pages, I am\namazed that a newspaper such as\nyours which pretends to defend\nfree speech by attacking any\nquestions about Rupert Murdoch's financial interests can be\nrunning such a voracious\ncampaign against our own on-line\nmagazine. Perhaps the\ncontradiction can be easily\nexplained by stating the obvious:\nyou disagree with us.\nNothing in our web pages\ncould cause Rupert Murdoch to\ntake legal action against us since\nwe are protected by several\neducation acts. The article was\ncredited to me personally and is\nnot official ConSoc policy (what\ndo you think \"Off the Record\"\nmeans?) Your implicit defence of\nMurdoch, coming from a \"politically neutral\" paper wasn't signed however. Can we take it\nthat this is official Felix policy?\nYour hysteria over my\npolitical views shows that Felix is\nno place for rationally discussing\nthe issues of the day - hence the\nneed for our society.\nThe majority of people in\nthis country are uninterested in\npolitics and there is tremendous\nscope for people such as\nMurdoch to use tabloid\nsensationalism to influence the\nviews of his wide readership by\nrelying on the fact that they\nwon't be bothered to assess his\nnewspapers' articles for bias or\nfactual content.\nSimilarly a lot of people at\nIC have little knowledge or\ninterest in ConSoc. But many of\nthem, particularly some\nuninitiated fresher s may naively\nbelieve that all of your staff are\ncapable of seriously reporting\nevents accurately without\nmelodrama.\nIan Bayley\nConSoc Chairman\nYou're spot on: I do disagree\nwith you, although I don't much\ncare for Rupert Murdoch either,\nquite frankly. And I promise\nfaithfully to never make\ndefending multi-national media\ntycoons official policy. But what\ngave you the idea that Felix was\n'politically neutral'?\nI trust that you feel you\nhave satisfactorily redressed the\nbalance for all those naive\nfresher s.

Critically\nacclaimed songs from a reasonably unknown\nartist are popularly reinterpreted by mainstream\nstars such as Elton John, Bono, Tori Amos, Sting,\nPeter Gabriel and Billy Joel. BILLYJOEL! Yes\nyou now start to see that other edge biting - you\nget the most ridiculous paring of song and singer\nIf matador\nare cool it's because\nno-one has\nheard of\nthem.\n- and the worst of this situation is that the Billy\nJoel version of 'Light as a Breeze' is one of the\nbetter covers on the record. More problematically Sting manages to sing 'Sisters of\nMercy' at a different speed to the backing\ninstruments of the Chieftains, which is\nsomewhat off-putting, and then we have to\nendure Bono talking, rather than singing,\n'Hallelujah'. Maybe the problem is that\neveryone's trying to be clever; too clever for the\nsongs of Leonard Cohen obviously.\nIn complete contrast the subtitle to Rare on\nAir: volume 2 is \"live sessions from KC RW's morning becomes eclectic\" - people you've\nprobably not heard of (excluding those you have\nsuch as Tanya Donelly of Belly and the\nCranberries) singing live on KCPcW, a Californian radio station.\nThe rest of the collection\ncertainly fulfils that subtitle; as track\nafter track roll on with understated\nbands playing their most understated\nsongs. Bettie Serveert slow dive through\n'Palomine' with the controlled despair\nthat has become their trademark and\nLou Barlow of Sebadoh beautifully\napologise s his way through 'Beautiful\nFriend'. JJ Cale and World Party briefly\nbreak through the atmosphere and\ninject some vigour before the likes of\nJoni Mitchell bring it down again.\nOverall though the pace is\nperhaps a little too slow. The excellent\nVolume 1 was if anything more obscure\nin terms of artists but it managed to\navoid getting trapped in the eddies of\nmoodiness. Still for those who are\ndiscerning, Rare On Air is still a world\naway from the deadening thud of\nLeonard Cohen's songs being mauled.\ngig: matador records european tour part 2*\nSome say that Matador Records are the coolest\nrecord label on the face of the planet. Ofcourse\nmost people don't actually express a preference,\nnot actually having heard of Matador Records or\nanything, and that's the point. If Matador are\ncool it's because no-one has heard of them or the\nwaves of obscure and downright lo fi bands they\nrelease records for.\nTake the first part of their European tour\nwhich gave us Chavez, the Amps and the mighty\nGuided By Voices. The Amps (headed by Kim\nDeal of the Breeders) 'stole' the show and\ndespite the fact that GBV headlined, a significant section of the crowd vanished after\nDeal and co had finished playing. Part two contained such notables as Railroad\nJerk and Helium, with Bailter Space headlining.\nNot many Billboards top 100 hits in that line-up\nyou'd imagine, correctly. And yet because\nMatador Records are cool, there were some\ngreat sounds.\nThe implausibly named Railroad Jerk\nopened proceedings with a wave of a guitar\nstolen from the Jon Spencer Blues Explosion\n(incidentally another Matador band, but you\nknew that anyway because you've not heard of\nJon Spencer have you?). Something borrowed\nfrom the blues and added to the present, they\nplayed funky stuff and even managed to get a harmonica in on the act.\nHelium were next, with fronts person Mary\nTimony's particular blend of wo my n voodoo-kitsch marking out a territory all of its own.\nBailter Space swirled on for over an hour of\ndroning and trance-inducing riffing. Sometimes\nthere were melodies to hang on to, other times the audience was left to fall down a seemingly\nbottomless pit of d is focus s. But all the time,\nBailter Space operated with wide grins slashed\nacross their faces. Being cool never meant not\nenjoying yourself\n\n"

    "content": "FEATURES FELIX FRIDAY OCTOBER 6TH1995. SEVEN\nREADING TO REFRESH\nTired of wading through textbooks for that vital solution? Why\nnot try relaxing with the Haldane Collection...\nLast year Felix published a witty alternative\nguide to the Central Library, complete with\nmap. As this showed incontrovertibly that\nthe most memorable feature of the Haldane\nCollection are the \"cool music bit\", NME,\nthe newspapers, and the Audio-Visual Room,\nthis account of the College's Humanities and\nrecreational library will take up the story\nfrom there.\nThe Haldane collection is situated on\nlevel one of the Imperial College and Science\nMuseum libraries, and lends most of its stock\n(books, maps, printed music and sound\nrecordings) on the IC and S ML ticket. It has\ntwo primary functions - to support the teach-include Auto Car and Motor, Radio Times,\nNewsweek, Private Eye, Plays and Players,\nand Which. Newspapers are held for one\nweek, and one of our most frequently asked\nenquiries is where back issues can be found.\nHere are some of the many answers to this. A complete run of the Times (mostly in micro-form) can be seen by Science Museum library\nstaff on level 3 of the IC and Science\nMuseum, and the Financial Times from 1993\nonwards (updated quarterly) can be consulted on CD ROM in the Electronic\nInformation Services, level 2. Other newspapers and periodicals are held in nearby public\nlibraries; the Haldane holds copies of the\ning of the Humanities Programme\nother academic activity, and to\nprovide material for all members\nof the College to read or listen to\nin those increasingly precious\nleisure moments. As the purpose\nof this article is to emphasise the\nlatter function (\"all work and no\nplay...\" - those who can't complete the quotation can look it up\nin the Oxford Dictionary of .. \\ U! English Proverbs), academic features will be mentioned only in\npassing. These include the aforementioned Audio-Visual\nCollection, which the alternative\nguide found to be \"alas... for College purposes only\". You are of course welcome to pick\nup a handout or come and ask about it l The range of the Haldane's40,000 volumes is wide. Subjects covered in the greatest depth are mostly those in which courses\nare taught, such as history, politics, philosophy and literature, as well as art and music.\nTravel and biography are well represented,\nand other subjects covered include sport,\nhumour, popular medicine, car manuals, psy-ch ology, feminism, crime, law, language and\nconsumer issues. There is a good collection of\ncurrent fiction, which is one of the more popular sections of the library; we now have a second copy of John Grisham's The\nChamber, but there are still queues, so you\nare strongly encouraged to reserve early!\nDaily newspapers and some sixty periodicals of general interest are taken. The latter\nKensington and Westminster location lists.\nWorld Wide Web is becoming increasingly useful for news and other information.\nFor example, if someone else is using the current FT, selective information from it, including the top story and technology report can\nbe seen on the web. If you wish to get a listing of, for example, the weeks' science programmes without sc rut in ising every page of\nthe Radio Times, the BBC schedules of television and radio programmes provide a quick\noverview. Ask the Haldane staff to demon-st rate, or try it yourself on the PC cluster\n(level two).\nThe Music collection is both popular and\nclassical. In the popular section, besides\nNME and other magazines, there are cassettes and CDs. the \"Jazz, Folk and Pop\" collection is dominated by rock and its develop-ment s. These recordings are purchased by IC\nUnion and selected by student buyers elected each year. This year we are fortunate to\nhave buyers already (if no-one is elected,\nnothing is bought) and your suggestions will\nbe welcome. You may give these directly to\nthe buyers, Sarah White and Matt Crompton\nin ICU, or fill in a library recommendation\nform which the staff will forward to them.\nAll CDs, by the way, popular or classical are\ncharged at 50p per issue (which compares\nvery favourably with many public libraries).\nThe classical section of the Music library\nconsists of books, periodicals such as Opera,\nprinted music including vocal scores, miniature scores, chamber music parts, and recordings on CD and cassette. These are\nof interest to both the new and\nmore experienced listener. There\nare favourites such as Vivaldi's Four Seasons and Pavarotti albums,\na good stock of standard repertoire\nand works well beyond \u2014 lesser\nknown works, the avant garde, and\nearly music, for example. A wide\nselection of language courses on\ncassette are also held in the Music\nlibrary.\nReading and listening are of course\nnot the only services provided. The\nHaldane staff (Jane Agnew, Anna\nBozic, and myself) are glad to\nanswer your enquiries or to refer queries specialised beyond the scope of Haldane else-where. Nearby libraries which Imperial\nCollege students may consult for reference\ninclude the Royal Geographical Society,\nRoyal College of Music and National Sound\nArchive.\nFinally the Haldane puts on exhibitions\nand cultural events. This term it is marking\nthe Purcell tercentenary with an informal\nexhibition and with a recital of Purcell\nrecordings from the National Sound Archive\nby Timothy Day, Curator of Western Art\nMusic at the Archive, and broadcaster on\nRadio 3, on Tuesday 14 November at 5:30pm speak (admission free). Next term we hope\nto have a well-known science fiction writer to\nspeak. Watch for announcements in the\nlibrary, on the walkways, in IC Reporter.\n\n"

    "content": "FOUR . FELIX FRIDAY OCTOBER 6TH1995 FEATURES\nSandwich politics: The best David finds himself stuck between the extra thick cut\nprices of the local Sarnie Stalls, wondering if perhaps\nthey've bitten off more than they can chew\nSettling into college life involves (ir)regulating one's eating habits in one way or another. Like it or not,\nunless you are a budding Master Chef, sooner or\nlater you will find the pleasure and instant\nsatisfaction offered to you by the ubiquitous\nsandwich.\nThe Catering department, controller of all the\nmain alimentary outlets on campus other than\nDaVinci's and the Union Bar, is responsible for\nproviding such foodstuffs to the College populace.\nTo the impoverished student, now tackling\nlarger debts than ever, a good deal on cheap food\nshould therefore be of prime interest. It seems\nstrange then that Catering do not reflect this\nnecessity. A quick comparison of the local private\nshops, scattered around the page, to the College run\njoints shows a surprisingly small difference (if any)\nin service, and certainly in price. Considering the\nfact that Catering outlets do not have to bear the\noverheads laid on those shops one would expect\nthem to be cheaper. At the very least because they\nshould be non-profit making service providers,\nprofits should either be reinvested in the outlet\nitself, or go towards sub sidi sing the items they sell to\nstudents..Neither of these is the case at present.\nStrict price controls imposed by Catering\nmanagement ensure that all outlets have profit as\ntheir prime goal. In the case of the SCR (Senior\nCommon Room) and the M DH( Main Dining Hall)\nthis is understandable as their combined loss for\n94/95 was in excess of \u00a3187,000. However, both\nthe Queens Tower Snack Bar (QT) and the\nSouthside Shop A reluctant last resort for lazy\nstarving students. Prices are reasonable for the area(\u00a31.10 to \u00a31.50 for\nyer average sandwich!) A student shop? You could've fooled me!\n\"...Milk's cheaper at Harrods\", I 've heard.\nHarts Although a little far (Next to Gloucester road or\nSouth Ken tube stations) Harts offer a large range of sandwiches\nmatching those in the QT and Southside Shop both in price and\nin quality. For those who like to take a little exercise before\nlunch. (Open 24 hours)\nGreenfield s Imperial students enjoying a bite at\nGreenfields, the cosmopolitan sandwich bar on Exhibition Road near\nSouth Ken Station. A secret-ish spot guarded by its clientele. High\nquality food, fair to expensive prices though.\nFEATURES\nFELIX FRIDAY OCTOBER 6TH1995. FIVE\nthing since Sliced Bread? Priced the same as the Southside Shop, despite its rather\nmore student centred location (less chance of naughty ouside rs getting a cheap eat!) Generally in appalling disrepair, no reasonable\njustification for the prices.\nQT\nSouthside Shop made tidy profits during that same\nperiod (\u00a358,145 and \u00a322,036 respectively). The\nSouthside Bar came a close second at \u00a351,327 profit\nfor 94/95 (Figures from Monthly Catering Accounts\nJULY 1995). These are net-profit figures quoted\nafter all other refurbishment costs/administrative\nfees, etc... have been deducted from the takings.\nOne cannot help but ask whether these profits\nmight be better put to use sub sidi sing the cost of\nstudent purchases, and in the very least improving\nthe quality of areas such as the JCR. Instead they are\npoured into the abyss created by the losses Catering\nincurs due to the SCR and M DH. Happily it has\nbeen recognised that the bulk of the aforementioned\nlosses are due to the appalling situation these outlets\nare in.\nJohn Foster, Catering Manager: \"Staff currently\nenjoy high wages and long holidays... comparable to\nacademic level.\" Mr Foster also mentioned a high\nrate of sickness amongst staff; this means contract\nworkers have to be hired regularly and at premium\nrates to cover for the regular absences. \"We wouldn't put the prices up if we didn't have to\", he\nmaintained, \" we're here for the students, but we\nhave to break even\".\nStudents, the predominant customer-base, are as\nusual the hardest hit. If Catering is to control the\nmonopoly of food outlets on Campus surely it\nshould ensure that, in places such as the QT,\nsubsidies are made available to students. There is no\nreason for staff and students to support this\ndepartment if nothing is ever given back, either in\nterms of price or by refurbishing the surroundings\nand improving their quality.\nThe shadow of the Imperal College Students\nUnion's imminent move to the Sherfield Building\n(see news in brief) has given rise to rumours that\nCatering may devolve its responsibilities to Union\nCatering which will then take control of all food\noutlets on the South Kensington Campus Premises.\nIf this is so, Union Catering would have to maintain\nits high standards while streamlining the operation it\ninherits to ensure long term benefits to students,\nstaff and the Union are guaranteed.\nSandWICh ShOP An earthy shop, tucked away\non Gloucester Road. Another secret bargain joint. Again, prices\ncompetitive with College outlets, with the added special half-price sandwich deal after 4.00pm. Great vegetable samos as and\nreal chips too!\n\n"

Distributing\nleaflets from a stand outside\nBeit Arch on Prince Consort\nRoad, entitled \"Discovering\nIslam\", they claim that the\n\"western secular way of life is\nnot working\".\nHowever, one of the\norganisers claimed that they\nwere not proponents of an\nIslamic state as such, but were\nmerely \"raising awareness.\"\nAccording to sources at ICU, the group's aggressive style\nwarranted concern among\nUnion Stewards who asked\nthem to relocate.\nWhen this failed, College\nsecurity called the Police, who\nwatched from outside the newly\nrefurbished Aeronautics Chemical Engineering entrance.\nShortly afterwards they asked\nthe group to move slightly to\none side as they were blocking\nthe main Union entrance.\nHowever the Hizb-ut-Tahrir\ncampaigners complied with this\nrequest.\nHizb-ut-Tahrir came to\nprominence in October 1994\nafter allegedly distributing antisemitic and homophobic\nliterature at the University\nLondon Union, and IC's own\nIslamic Society distanced itself\nfrom the group, as have many\nmainstream Muslims.\nA thirty-year-old international organisation, Hizb-ut Tah rir feel that western\nproblems such as poverty and\nunemployment could be solved\ncontinued on page 2\nBY IVAN CHAN The annual Freshers' Flea Market - another creative name for\nfresher s' fair - took place on Tuesday afternoon. While committee\nmembers of clubs and societies tried to get as many members as\npossible, fresher s and non-fresher s received more and more leaflets.\nStudents readily solved the problem of excessive pamphlets by\ngetting rid of them in the nearest bin.\nAlmost 200 clubs, societies and businesses braved the rain to\ndisplay their wares around the Queen's Lawn, Sherfield building\nand throughout I CU.\"I think it was a great success,\" said Tim Townend, Deputy\nPresident (Clubs and Societies).\nDrinking to Excess\nICU staff angrily denounced an\narticle in last week's Time Out\nwhich suggested that Imperial\nstudents have a problem with\ndrinking to excess.\nPage 3\nFire in Garden Hall\nGraham Cox, IC Fire Officer,\nhas denied there is any problem\nwith the fire alarm system in the\nlight of a fire in Garden Hall last\nmonth.\nPage 2\n\n"

    "content": "book: lost in music giles smith,\n\"Caught in a trap, no turning back, we're lost in\nmusic\" - that's how the song goes and the\nsentiments seem entirely appropriate. After\nfootball, Nick Hornby and his gang of literary\nnew lads( Giles Smith included) have turned\ntheir home counties' glance toward music. The\nresult; books to cater lor every Q readers'\nChristmas list.\nWhich is not to say that Smith's Lost In\nMusic, in particular, is a bad book by any means.\nIt's clever, occasionally funny and all shot\nthrough with the sort of parochial understatement which made England little. And\nSmith has a tale to tell, recounting his trials in the\nmusic industry as he fumbles from one poorly\nnamed group to the next. But overall what's significant is the numbing mixture of\nsuperficiality and obsession al detail, without\nnormality in between. Cross a music\nencyclopedia and the discos you had at primary\nschool and you're getting close.\nThe only point of connection with actual life\nseems to be the chapter when Giles' father dies.\nAt the funeral there were, \"no pop songs,\nobviously. Because my father didn't like pop\nsongs. And because there isn'ta pop song written\nthat could have been played there\".\n1\n|\n1\n|\nI1;111 IS11111! Wismmssm\nprimary school\nexhibition: africa - royal academy*\nWhere do you start? would seem to be the obvious\nquestion to ask on entering the Royal Academy's new exhibition : Africa - the art of a continent'.\nEven with the ability to display over eight hundred\nworks, the RA have had some hard decisions to\nmake on what exactly to show in their\nembracing ly titled show. Rightly or wrongly they\nhave decided on objects rather than what we in\nthe West would usually consider to be Art'. In\npractice this means that the exhibition in the main\nconsists of figure tte s, masks and statues with the\nodd sprinkling of jewell ry and textiles.\nIt's an approach which makes sense\nparticularly as the exhibition is laid out in such a way as to show the development from purely\nfunctional items, such as axe heads, to the purely\nsymbolic as most gloriously seen in the golden\nidols of the Egyptians. On the other hand it does\nleave the RV looking a little like the Museum of\nMankind at times and you do wonder whether\nthe curator could have included some paintings as\nwell.\nThat said, there's still enough on display to\nkeep you occupied. The enormous scope of the\nexhibits (ranging in both time and geography) almost by necessity throws up some interesting\nthoughts. Some of the figures could be exhibited\nas modem abstracts, such has been the full circle\nexperienced in that form of representation. More\nobviously there are the facial styles that Modigliani\nplundered, and indeed if anything is\nrepresentative of the entire exhibition it is the\nmultiplicity of human faces and masks which are\ndisplayed.\nVery few of them are realistic. Reflecting\ntheir use in ritualistic and religious ceremonies\nthey show the whole gambit of human emotions,\nfrom grinning clowns to eerie witch-doctor\nhow lef s. There are also examples of Coptic\nChristian and Islamic art which also shed new\nlight on the traditional examples that we are more\nfamiliar with. The Coptic crucifixions are\nparticularly good in this respect.\nOverall however, the exhibition does suffer\nfrom being no more than the sum of its parts.\nThere's no strand to tie the whole thing together,\nlike the continent it's something of an enigma.\nspaces: \u2022\nbarbie -<m3i he Miles,\ntradition ami lin v x'l unu. \u2022 0127\n\u2022:'2 \\l)B< BW.\nwes yJ lian \u2022\u2022/<-.i:?vn i. nation. 7 839\nnotion;\njo ra phf o. \u2022, . \u00ab\ni.n.,1 academy 01714397438\npie o ad;! mB^SM\nal rim ii cm1111:::^'' ill '\n: siv um te in por v;'ip vi\\ MfBB^B^B&^ MBB. \u2022;\n^f^B'.i B?^ By%\nBB^BB BBBB B^ BBl "

Further\ninformation can be obtained\nfrom the Union adviser.\nOptions include Court orders,\nwhich order the person to stop\nthe harassment or action,\nunder the Criminal Justice &\nPublic Order Act 1994. This\nact makes \"intentional harass-ment\" a criminal offence.\nLegal action can also be taken\nregarding physical assault. In\nthese cases further advice\nshould be sought immediately\nfrom the Union adviser.\nREMEMBER - you do not\nhave to put up with harass-ment.

I know that\nFelix has been reporting on\nexcessive alarm ringing now for\nover a year.\nSo why is it then that the\nsystem still causes us - both students and staff - so many problems. Last Monday night is but\none example in a continuing, and\nseemingly unending line of false\nalarms for this 'sophisticated s ys tem'.\nWith a leak in a ventilation\npipe and a exhaust duct that was\nrestricted the alarms on the third\nfloor of the Union went off. This\nwasn't the most notable part of\nthe evening, it was the requisite\nclearing of the building half an\nhour before the advertised closing time that caused the problems. How do you explain to a group of not fully sober revellers\nthat the alarm has not actually\nbeen activated on purpose so\nthat the staff can go home early?\nWell by all accounts this is not\nsomething readily explain able to\nthe average punter!\nThis time the cause was\nsomething which can be fixed,\nbut what about the continuous\nexcuses of student cooking and\npeople spending too long in the\nshower. How long is it before it\nis realised that students are not\nlikely to change their culinary\nhabits just so that a 'high tech'\nfire alarm system can be\ninstalled.\nThe authorities are not\naware of the level of sce pt is is m that the average student has\nwhen they hear an alarm these\ndays. What is the point of getting\nout of bed in the middle of the\nnight when you know its not\ngoing to be for real anyway?\nA case in point is the\nGarden Hall 'incident' which\noccurred over the Summer. Just\nhow many people actually bothered to get up and out of the\nHall whilst the alarms sounded.\nHaving spoken to quite a few of\nthe residents, the answer is - not\na lot.\nAnd who can blame them\nwith this constant stream of false\nalarms which can hardly be kept\na secret in a college this size. So\nthe onus then focus on the maintainers and installers of the\nalarms to respond with a system\nthat is suitable to student halls.\nWhile College does have to\nhave to conform to stringent regulations during Vacation time so\nthat they can operate halls as\nhotels, these are not required for\nterm time residency. What will\nhappen when there actually is a fire and a student dies because\nthey didn't bother leaving hall\nfor the third time that week?\nWill College then realise that\nthey were putting student lives\nin danger all along - or will they\nstill reject all accusations of negligence and continue to blame it\non the students?\nSUBEDITORS: JEREMY, MARK BAKER, JON JORDAN AND TED W.

THREE\nPC\nClive\nReports\nIC Drink Problem Denied\nAlcohol Awareness Campaign Planned\nReturning students enjoyed the start of the new term at the Freshers' events this week.\nBY ALEX FEAKS\nCollege authorities reacted\nstrongly to suggestions\npublished this week in London's listing magazine, Time Out, that\nImperial College has a problem\nwith student drinking. The\narticle said that there was\n\"excessive drinking on campus\"\nat Imperial.\nAlan Swanson, Pro-Rector\n(Educational Quality) thought\nthe report to be inaccurate,\nhighlighting what, in reality,\neffects only a small number of\nstudents. \"Our best estimate is\nthat the average spent per\nstudent per annum on drink is\nonly about \u00a3100.\"\nEven allowing for the\nstudents at Imperial who spend\nlittle or no money in college\nbars, this figure implies that\nthere is only a core of a few\npeople who are drinking a lot.\nSarah White, ICU\nPresident, was \"annoyed that\nthe article created a negative\nimage of the College,\" and\ninsisted that IC was \"no worse\nthan anywhere else\". ICU has\nrecently begun to enforce a policy of not allowing those\nobviously drunk onto their\nlicensed premises, and last year\nthe C CU Presidents signed a document stating alcohol\nconsumption at their events is\nnot obligatory. These moves are\npart of co-ordinated attempt to\nde-institutional is e excessive\nstudent drinking and the\nbehaviour it can encourage.\nMost excessive and rowdy\ndrinking is annoying for other\nbar users and an unpleasant\nmorning after for the\nparticipants PC Clive Coleman,\nwhose beat includes the\ncampus, said that incidents for\nwhich he is called out to college\nfor are often drink related.\nThese are most commonly\nneighbours complaining about\nthe noise, although there have\nbeen more serious\noffences including a number of\nassaults on Union stewards in\nthe past year.\nA rise in the number of\nreported drink related incidents\nover the last few years\ncaused the College to\nestablishing a policy on drinking\nfor both students and staff. For\nexample, College Catering have\nbeen instructed to not hold\nlunchtime promotions to bring\nthem into line with the Union.\nA House Committee met in\nJune to discuss the issue and\ninformal talks with Union\nrepresentatives over the\nsummer agreed on increasing\nawareness of drink related\nproblems, including holding an\n'Awareness Week' sometime\nthis term.\nPC Coleman joined with\nthe Union and College authorities in endorsing a new\ninitiative on campus - Bar Watch\n- following the 'barred from one,\nbarred from all' principle. Union\nstaff have, however, been\nreluctant to set up any kind of\n'rogue's gallery' of offenders,\nsaying that it create a 'Big\nBrother' image that they would\nrather avoid.\nDear Readers,\nWelcome to Imperial\nCollege. I am the local\ncommunity officer for the area.\nMy involvement at the college is\nto report crimes, give student\ntalks, organise crime prevention\ndisplays and code pedal cycles.\nI will assist in any personal\nor police matters.

In March, the Japanese\nare coming to the UK with determination to\nregain the title.\nNippon Kempo is a relatively modern\ncombat sport. Unlike most other commonly\nknown ancient and mystical Japanese martial\narts, Nippon Kempo can boast a history of\nonly 65 years. Muneumi Sawayama set about\ndeveloping a sport the was free of the rituals\nand dogma that restricted the traditional arts\nto a narrow group of techniques. Nippon\nKempo incorporates all and any technique\nthat can be effectively, safely and practically\napplied in combat, using a full suit of protective body armour, fashioned around ancient\nSamurai armour. The sport is based on scoring points using tact and skill rather than a knockout, thus avoiding most of the injuries\nthat commonly occur in martial arts.\nThe core of Nippon Kempo is at the\nUniversity of London club, which is based at\nSOAS (in Russell Square). All the club's senior members and coaches have been\ntrained by Physiology and Sports Science\nProfessor Doya, of Osaka City University\neither in Japan or on his training visits to the\nUK. In 1992, a UK team consisting of 80%\nSOAS club members won the Nippon\nKempo World Championship. This was highly unexpected by the Japanese and they are\ncurrently preparing with vengeance for the\nnext International Championship due to be\nheld in Birmingham, March '96. Teams from\nItaly, France and America are also expected.\nNippon Kempo is currently expanding to\nIC. There exists a unique opportunity for IC\nstudents and staff to be trained by coaches\nthat have accumulated a wealth of\nexperience. Those who join the IC\nclub will automatically have membership of the ULU club. This harbours\nthe rather intriguing tradition of having\nat least one or two UK resident\nJapanese who take up Nippon Kempo\nfrom scratch with us. Anyone interested in Nippon Kempo is welcome. The\n00\nclub atmosphere is friendly and\nrelaxed and you will be able to train at\nyour own pace. If you want to become\na champion, then we will get you\nthere,but if you want to get fit, have\nfun and learn how to protect yourself,\nj*. you are equally welcome. Most members who train regularly are able to\nachieve a black belt, first-aid and\ncoaching qualifications as well as fitness and\nconfidence by the time they graduate.\nFor training times and more information,\ncontact Ian mercer, Department of\nChemistry (0171 594 5807, internal 45807,\nian.mercer@ic.ac.uk) or David Akera (0171\n631 5291 - work).\n\n"
