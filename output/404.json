For once, fifteen\nplayers turned up, more or\nless on time; and there was an unheard-of event: the coach\nleft on time. Normality then\nreasserted itself. After a few yards the coach stopped\nin response to a lot of\nnoise from the first fifteen\nwho were also aboard, but\nas the reason for the noise\nwas not obvious to- anyone,\nincluding the first fifteen\napparently, the coach preceded\nonly to stop again at the\nAlbert Hall for ten minutes\nbefore Steve Booth arrived\nand em bussed. The significance of that event also escaped\nthe As. Then there was the\nfather-and-mother of all traffic jams in Knightsbridge;\nthen a couple of stops to ask the way; and then we had\narrived, miraculously on\ntime. That was fine for the\nfirst fifteen but rough for the\nAs.\" Get changed and back on\nyour coach,\" shouted a person who may have been\nthe Romford & G idea Park\ncaptain or keeper. The As obeyed and after another\ncoach ride arrived at the\nground and, after indicating\nseriousness of intent,'got the\ngame started.\nEnd of excitement? Alas, no. After only ten minutes\nNigel Willshire threw himself\nto the ground and refused to\nrise. After consultation an\nambulance was summoned and\nWillshire lay painfully on\nthe cold ground to await it. Could we play around him?\nThat would have been a bit\nmuch. (Someone may have\ntripped over him and been\ninjured.) We waited, standing\naround on the cold ground\nand sym pathi sing with him. After half an hour the\nambulance arrived and much\nto our surprise was not\nbeing driven by a go-slow\njunior doctor but just by a go-slow ambulance driver.\nThe obstacle having been\nremoved, the game proceeded,\nwith one man missing and\nlittle daylight left.\nInspite of the weak end A's team the Park team (which\nincluded an IC turncoat)\nnever looked like scoring,\nbut then neither did the A's. In the second half the A's did a bit better, scoring\ntwo tries to settle the match.\nRod Porter got the first,\nfollowing a Park mistake on\nthe line, and Rich Jenner got\nthe second. Chris Becque\ngot the ball from Bob Leeson, beat four players, and gave\nRich a simple scoring pass. All Rich had to do was to run\nit in ... from the half-way\nline. John Fishburn managed\nto convert it. That try was all the better for having\nbeen carried out in pitch\ndarkness. The A's have\nbeen instructed to eat nothing\nbut carrots in case we have\nsimilar problems next week.\nThe tri p back was un event fu I except for the half hour\nspent at the local hospital\nman oe uv ring Nigel( it-only-hurts-when-l laugh) Willshire out of a wheelchair and\ninto the coach.

Cutteridge Cup 2nd Round\nRoyal Vets 3 Imperial College 4\nby Paul Robins\nIC TRAVELLED up to the\nRoyal Vets ground in darkest\nHertfordshire knowing that\nthey had a tough match on\ntheir hands against a strong\nside. Miraculously, the\ncoach was only 10 minutes\nlate, and so we arrived at\n2pm, in good time for a2.30 kick off. The mental attitude\nof the team was good, and\nthey went onto the field\ndetermined to win. For only\nthe third time this season,\nwe won the toss, and elected\nto play against the wind\nand rain (it was a lovely\nday for rugby). IC's forwards\nstarted with a bang for a change, and despite the\nwind disadvantage, set up\nsome good positions for\ntheir backs. When Vets\nkicked a long clearance,\nIC counter attacked from\ntheir own 2 5 . Some superb,\nquick, clean handling by\nthe backs, with the forwards\nwinning three good ruc ks, put*\nAlan Gregory over in the\ncorner for a fine try. IC\nwere rampant now, and should\nhave turned this to points\nadvantage. But several\nplayers became a little over\neager, and from one such\nbout of rashness in the\nforwards, Vets reduced the\ndeficit to a single point\nwith a penalty goal just\nbefore half time. This was still an excellent position\nfor IC, as they turned around\nwith the wind in their favour.\nUnfortunately, the second\nhalf, was a long story of\nsuccessive penalties against\nus, surely not all justified,\nand this rattled our composure,\nparticularly in the forwards.\nAll we could do was s it back\nand defend, and this we did magnificently, with barely a tackle being missed. Due to\nthe narrowness of our\nwinning margin, we were\nvery pleased to hear the\nfinal whistle, which took us\ninto the semi-finals, to be\nplayed on February 11th, mark\nit down in your diaries, as support would be much\nappreciated. (See A Tel lam,\nPress y, Supporters So'c): Team: B Finney, A Gregory,\nR Stern, N Gibbs, A Devaney,\nT Fearn, I Maclain, R Austin,\nR Doyle, K Lipscombe,\nJ Smith, P Turley, P Robins.\nORIENTEERING! by David Rosen\nON WEDNESDAY last week,\na party from IC braved the\nwind and rain to take part in\na 'Score Event' on Hampstead\nHeath. There were thirty\nmarkers laid out, and\ncompetitors had to find as\nmany as possible within\n60 minutes. For every\nminute overdue, one point\nwas deducted from the score.\nLen Fawett managed to\nfind a remarkable number of\nthe points \u2014 18, but bad\ntimekeeping meant he was13 minutes late which\ndrastically reduced his score. Pete Johnson was easily the winner with 13\npoints, having arrived back\nwith 45 seconds to spare.\nMartin Kessler also did well to find 12 markers but\nhe was also overdue, which\nreduced his score to 9.\nJames Sinclair, Michael\nPaceyand Matthew Clements\nwere all orienteering for\nthe first time with the club,\nwith varying degrees of\nsuccess, although the last\nmentioned managed to obtain\na large negative score by\nforgetting to wind his watch\nup before starting.\nTABLE TENNIS TALLY Imperial College 1st BSC\nImperial College 2nd Churchill\n5\n4\n7\n2\nLAST WEEK saw the start\nof the inter-league knockout\ncup. The First s had a difficult\naway match against BSC who\npressing them for second\nplace in their division. With the game tied at 4\u20144\nKawei beat BSC' S number\none player in a tense last\nmatch to clinch the match.\nThe second team, after\na bad start to the season,\nhad won their last two\nleague games and were in\na confident mood against\nChurchill. They easily\nscored their third successive win, to move through to the\nsecond round of the cup.\nThe First league tables\nwere circulated' last week\nshowing the First team as\njoint leaders of their division with Harrow Road Police, but\nunfortunately these are a week out of date, and since they were compiled a depleted\nFirst team was soundly\nbeaten by the Police. With three defeats in their\nfirst three games followed by\ntwo wins the second team was\nin the middle of their division. If recent improved form\ncontinues however, they will soon be pressing the leaders.\nImperial College II 6\nFulham V3 WILLIAM HO continued his undefeated run of games for\nthe second team, as they\nbeat Fulham by a much greater\nmargin than the score\nsuggests. This now means\nthe second team have won\ntheir last four games and\ncaused quite an upset in the\nleague.\nLast week also saw one\nof the semi-finals of the\ncollege knockout being\nplayed. William Ho who had\nnarrowly edged out Tim Ward in his quarter finals\nmatch was playing against\nYee Min Yi u who had also had a hard fight to beat\nMike Per di os.Ho looked\nlike continuing his winning\nways when he took the first\nset after some aggressive\nserves and rally s, but the\nexperience of Yi u, who plays\nfor London University, showed\nthrough and he fought back\nwell to win the game in\nthree sets.\nThe final will be played\non Wednesday 10th December\nin the TT room in the Union,\nand let's hope it is just as\ngood as the semi-final was. by Trevor Walker\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX\nII\nFELIX SPORT 2\nCROSS COUNTRY CHRONICLES LAST WEEK was the big\ntest of fitness for the Cross Country Club, with- two\nleague matches arranged\nwithin a space of four days.\nIn preparation we all eased\ndown for these events, Big Rob cutting his training from\n60 miles per week and the\nrest of us from 60 pints per\nweek.\nThe first match was the\nLondon Colleges League\nheld on Wednesday 19th in\nthe mud of Parliament Hill Fields. Our turn out was\nexcellent, Imperial contributing\n16 fine athletes to a field of\nover 100. After the initial\nsprint the field settled down\ninto their usual positions with\nthe young hopefuls and the\nrest of us plodding along a little in front/ behind (delete\nas appropriate) the main\npack. On this occasion the\nfirst team really pulled their\ntin gers out and we managed\nto finish (5 runners) in the\nfirst 15 places: Rob All in son3 rd. Ian Ellis6 th, Steve\nWebb 11th, Paul Clarke14 th, Dave Rosen 15th The second team was lead\nhome by Alf Gamett (31st), who it seems has now\ncompletely recovered from\nhis twisted ankle and can therefore no longer beat the\nfirst team! Yet again our\nsecond team was complete,\nbut unfortunately the 3rd team was not, but finished\noff in traditional style with\ngood packing at the back\nfrom our new stars Colin Dale\n(89th) and Martin Tarnowski\n(90th). The 2nd league match was the Courages (as in beer) at\nBath on Saturday 22nd. Fitness was telling at this\nstage and only 8 runners\nbraved the frost to arrive\nat the Union for a10.00 am( well almost) start. 100\nmiles and one plastic motorway cafe later we arrived at\nBath in time to walk around\nthe course before the race.\nIt was a pity however that\nwe didn't take Paul Clarke on the jaunt, because at the\ncritical time he couldn't find the start! (Orienteers\nnote \u2014 don't invite Paul along\nto your fixtures, he'll take\nall day to find the first\ncheck point.) By the time\nPaul found the start the\nback markers had at least a100 metres start on him, but\nnot dispirited by the sight\nof the race disappearing\nover the horizon Paul set off\nin pursuit and managed to\ncome 106th in a field of\nnearly 200.\nAs usual Rob was battling\nit out again at the front but\ndue to abdominal problems in\nthe last mile could only\nmanage 4th place. The rest\nof the team did not, however\nperform up to the standards\nof the previous Wednesday,\nand the placings stretched\nwe 1\n1 over 100.\nThe moral of this story\nis that if we try hard and do\n(too) well in a league we\nshould win this year (injuries\npermitting), but we don't seem to get such a good\nturnout, or good results for\nthe higher standard Courages'\nLeague. I think a shift of\nemphasis is needed.\nTHE ANNUAL TRIP to Potters\nBar last Wednesday almost\nfailed to start due to a. c.u. by the organisation. The result of this was that the\nfew stalwarts brave enough\nto run over the course,\naccompanied the IC 1st XV on their coach to the Royal\nVets College.\nOnce there, and like a bad\nWestern film, we stood\nes pectin g the cavalry in the\nform of Rob, Steve and Paul to arrive, but like Godot ...\nThe course consisted of a mixture of deep sticky clay\nploughed fields, some road\nand golf courses. The result\nwas a win for the Royal Vets,\nachieving this with some\ngood packing and well timed\nbursts of speed, one of which\nremoved Ian Ellis' s chances\nof winning whilst he was looking the other way. A special mention for Mr\nA. Davey who did not finish\nthe run because he returned\na dog he had lured away from\nits home. A new excuse we ask? On Saturday Rob All in son once again showed his excellent form by beating\nMick Fuller and coming close\nto winning the race against\nHercules Wimbledon and the\nBank of England.- As expected\nthe result was a win for\nHercules, but with some\nsolid running from Ian E Dave J and Steve W, we beat\nthe Bank by 57pts to 83pts. A fine run by Rich Harrington puts him within\ndistance of a first team place,\nbut Andy Davey needs some\ntraining in course-finding,\n(he got lost, again.)\nSWIMMING SENSATION by Andy Smith\nTHE FINAL of the UL U Swimming Championships\nwere held this year on Wed\n26th November. The IC\ncontingent having successfully battled through most of the\nheats, once again braved the\nIcy stretches of the Malet\nSt pool.\nThe first event was the\ndiving which turned out to\nbe IC's best event. Our\ntwo ' artistes' gained first\nand second place, there\nbeing no other entrants.\nAfter a very keenly fought\ncontest Rory Lewis just\npipped Andy Smith by 10\npoints or so, with both divers\nattempting four straight dives\nfrom the lowest board (almost\nmanaging them).\nHaving been given such\nan encouraging start the IC\nswimmers then proceeded to\ndominate the mens events.\nNick Hurley swam a fine\nindividual medley to finish\nthird, with Andy fifth. In the\n440 yards freestyle Rory\ngained a comfortable second\nplace with Dave Lowther not\nso comfortably fifth. In the\nblue ribbon event, the 110\nyards freestyle, Rory just\nmanaged to hold on to his title, despite a very strong\nchallenge from Elst on of\nKings' and our own Paul Frieze( still going after all these years). The220 yards\nbreaststroke saw Andy coasting\nin fourth, while the 110\nyards backstroke produced\na good swim from Ian Shott\nto finish third with Rory\nin a class of his own in\nfifth place. The final individual\nevent was the 110 yards\nbutterfly in which both Andy\nand Dave completed the\ncourse and finished third\nand fifth respectively.\nAgainst strong opposition\nthe medley team of Ian,\nColin Dale, Andy and Rory\nwas beaten into third place,\nbut amends were made In\nthe freestyle relay with\nRory, Dave, Andy and Paul\nthrashing all in sight to\nwin by almost half a length.\nWhen the points were,\nadded up, IC emerged clear\nwinners in the mens section,\nand even without a single\nfemale competitor were third\noverall behind Kings and Barts.\nOn the water polo front,\nIC first team entertained\nOxford University on Friday\n28th Nov and thrashed them\n10\u20143, goals coming from\nNick Hurley, Rory Lewis and even Dave Lowther. A busy week was then concluded\nby IC second team playing\nBra'c knell second team in the\nfirst round of the Winter\nHandicap KO. Both teams\nstarted with six goals\nhandicap and the match\nfinished at twenty goals to\nthirteen in IC's favour.\nGoals (seven) and noise\nwere supplied by Mike McCartney.\nHOCKEY HISTORY Imperial College 4 Royal Holloway 1\nPRIDING OURSELVES on\ngetting off the bus at the\ncorrect stop, we arrived at\nH arlington( before the\nopposition I!... Just!) only to\nfind that Janet (see my name\nin FELIX Coxage was absent.)\nThis meant that John Huckle\ndidn't umpire or write the report\nSuperior skill, fitness,\nteam spirit and the crippling\nof the opposition gave us an\neasy victory. Mr Incontinence\nmissed chances galore but\nwas lucky enough to score\nfour (one after a shot from the\nteam's Drag Artist that\nwouldn't have caused a ripple\non a pool of Bat' sP***l) As usual, the main events\nof the day took place in the\nbar. Sarah \" Bites yer legs\" Horn, being only a little girl,\nhad a beer shampoo. Jim Marshall discovered that\nplaying for the mixed team is\nworse than going on the Stoat's run, and Kim Houlden proved\nthat (whatever he has got) he\nain't got rhythm.\nThose taking part in the\nday's entertainments were:\nRae Mackay, John Huckle,\nJim Marshall, Sarah James,\nDave Balderson, Kim Houlden,\nRuth White, Jane Dracott, Sig\nGolding, Chas Hardy, Sarah\nHorn, Mr White and Mr Arthur\nLoveday (who would not\nprocrastinate further).\nImperial College 2 Bank of England 3rd2 WE KNOW now why the\ncountry is in financial trouble,\nYoung's bitter is only 16pa pint at the Bank of England\nsports Ground!\nThe quality of the hockey\nwas not devalued by the\npre sc en ce of second team\nplayers in the third although\nwe were one down after five\nminutes. Dave Carlile and\nRamesh Fat ania put the goals\nin before half time to give us\na deserved lead.\nEarly in the second half\nthe Bank scored a quick goal\nand subsequently managed to\nhold off our repeated attacks.\nWe were worth a win but cheap\nbeer and a good sing on the\ncoach made the trip most\nworthwhile.\nN Harrison, M Callun, R Vaz,\nHBarrett, TSethi, JBrownridge,\nD Balderson, D Carlile, E Rahman, R Fatania, N Bell \u2014\nsub P Nair.\n\n"

    "content": "* FELIX Opsoc-not virtuoso e sOPS OC has all the facets\nthat go to make a successful\nsociety. The members are\nnot only from IC, but students\nfrom other colleges, people\nwho could not bear to leave\nwhen they finished College,\nand various others who do\nnot fit into any particular\ncategory. Although there is\na close liaison with the\nRoyal College of Music\n(a great help to any musical\nsociety), \" virtuoso\" qualities\nare not necessarily required,\njust an enjoyment of singing\nand a desire to achieve a final polished performance.\nThe society' s main aim is\nthe production of two light\noperas (usually Gilbert and\nSullivan) every year. One\nof these takes place in\nCollege in February, and\npreparations for next term's\" Utopia Limited\" are well\nunderway. The second is\nthe summer vacation, when\nsingers, orchestra and stage -grew set-off to put on a show\nin some remote corner of\nEngland. A few years ago,\nthis 'tour' went to Budleigh\nSalterton in Devon, and was\nso well received that this\ntown has been the venue\nfor the summer performance\never since. There are also concerts at appropriate times\nsuch as Easter and Christmas,\nand carol singing around\nlocal hospitals. A new\nventure being attempted at\nthe end of this term Is a sponsored marathon sing,\nwhere the society will be\nsinging straight through all13 Gilbert \" and Sullivan\noperas consecutively (which\nit is reckoned, will take\nabout thirty hours to complete).\nApart from its musical\nactivities, Opsoc's social\nside Is very important to all\nIts members. The calender\nabounds with parties both in\nCollege and in people's houses. Every rehearsal\nends up retiring to Southside\nbar and so tends not to finish\nuntil .11.30! Hence by the\ntime it is getting close to\nperformance and rehearsals\noccur twice a week, people\ntend to find that their free\ntime is very occupied. This may sound like hard work,\nand occasionally it d nes seem so, but generally it\nis thoroughly enjoyed by all involved.\nThe greatest social event\nof the year is, however, the\nsummer tour. This is more\nof a holiday than two weeks\nof rehearsals and performances\n(of which there are nine In\nin all). At least it is this\nfor singers and orchestra;\nit is considerably harder for\nthose engaged in building a set from materials brought\nall the way from London.\nInsplte of the fact we\nhave a number of members\nwho have been with the society\nfor well over five years, an\nindication of the enjoyment\nto be found with us, anyone\nwith an interest in operetta\nor other forms of music, a desire to help on the technical\nside (set building, lighting,\ncostumes etc.) or just the\nwish to join a social musical\nsociety is welcome to any of\nour rehearsals In 53, Prince's Gate at 7.30 pm on Tuesday\nevenings.\nJazz Cluball that free\nmusic?!\nONE THING HAS struck me\nabove all else since joining\nthe Jazz Club Committee;\nthat is the difficulty of\ngiving away music free!\nOne would think that there\nwould be plenty of people\nwithin g nothing better to do\nthan sit in the comfort of\nthe Union Lower Lounge on\nSunday evening listening to\nlive bands whose music\nranges from rock (remember\nBurlesque!!) to traditional\njazz, but apparently this\nis not the case. If we have not been very\nsuccessful at attracting\naudiences, then at least\nwe have been extremely\nsuccessful in obtaining\nbands of a very high standard\nfrom all over London and\nencouraging college bands\nby providing a venue for\ngigs.\nThis brings me on to the\nplaying aspects of our\nactivities. The Jazz Club owns a rather sordid room\nlocated midway between\nthe Union office and Dramsoc\nin the Union Building. This is . available for use by\nmembers at anytime. We also\nown an amplifier, four\ncolumns, two microphones,\na drum kit, two piano es and\na double bass which are for\nuse by members.\nUnfortunately, the more\n'removable' items have to be\nkept under lock and key.\nMUSIC SOCIETY THE MUSICAL SOCIETY consists of two organisations\nwhich function independently\nof each other in their activities\nbut work together irv their\naim to provide an outlet for\ntha abilities of students\nin the music field. The two\nbodies are Imperial College\nSymphony Orchestra and\nImperial College Choir.\nThe Orchestra at present\nhas about forty regular\nplayers of whom the majority\nare IC students. It has been\nconducted for the past\ncouple of years by Dr Gavin\nPark. The Orchestra practices\nevery Wednesday in the\nGreat Hall. The Orchestra gives\nthree concerts a year, one\nin each term, and attempts\nto cover some major works.\nBesfdes this, the Orchestra\nruns smaller instrumental\ngroups such as the 'Wind\nBand' and the 'String Group'.\nThese offer the opportunity\nfor the players of various\ninstruments which may not\nbe required in the full\norchestra, to practice.\nThese facilities are regularly\nused by fi ye or six bands of\nvarious species and by many\nindividuals who just wish to\npractice their instruments.\nThat basically is the\nrange of our activities at present, but we are open\nto suggestions, particularly\nfrom people who are prepared\nto do a bit of work and help\nin the organisation (we are\ndesperately short of committee\nmembers). Anyone interested\nshould contact either myself\nor our President, Mike\nWoodward, Mech Eng 2.\nNigel Harrison, These groups can also give\ntheir own public performances.\nThe Orchestra is also a social group. Music Camp\nweekends, dinners and\nparties are arranged to\nenable members to get to\nknow each other.\nThe other section of the\nMusical Society is the\nChoir. This has a membership\nof approximately 160 and\nis conducted by Professor\nEric Brown. Practices are\nheld every Thursday evening\nin Lecture Theatre 342,\nMech. Eng. The Choir is\nmixed voice by virtue of its\nfemale singers recruited\nfrom surrounding colleges\nas well as IC.\nAs with the Orchestra,\nthe Choir g ves a concert in\neach term and the next\nconcert is on Friday5 th Dec (today) in the Great\nHall - all are welcome.\nBesides the concerts,\nthe Choir arranges activities for the members, aimed at\nproducing a good social spirit. This term, the Choir\nhas been on a week-end\nMusic Camp and before the\nend of term there will be a Christmas Dinner. The Choir\nwill sing at Christmas Hall Dinner, and there will be\nCarol Singing around the\nMews. Further activities\nare being arranged for next\nterm.\nA sub sidera ry group of the\nChoir is the Madrigal Singers\nwho meet after rehearsals.\nIf you sing or play an\ninstrument, the Musical Society hopes to provide some\npart for you tp play. If you\nenjoy listening to choral\nor orchestral music it is\nhoped that our efforts at\nconcerts give you pleasure.\nFolk Club no more 'till\nnext week!\nA SHADOWY figure stumbles\nin the dark, as he reaches for\nthe light switches, curses\nunder his breath as he catches\nthe lingering odour of cold\nHeinz Spaghetti, and burned\nsausages, and takes another\nsip from a half-hour old pint\nof IPA. It's the same old\nroutine again; open the\nwindows to freshen the air push the tables aside to\nmake more room, and sit and\nwait for the people to arrive.\nAnd then, for a few short\nhours, the Union lower\nRefectory becomes one of\nLondon's leading folk venues.\nThe guest singer arrives:\nmaybe a traditional singer\nfrom the Midlands, a comedian\nfrom up north, or a singer-songwriter from NW3. The\naudience drift in; some to\nlisten (and some to heckle);\nsome to stand up and sing,\n(and some to sit in the\ncorner and get pissed.)\nThere are many widely\ndifferent kinds of music that\nmay be called\" folk\", and\nmany different ways in which\n\" folk\" may be presented.\nAsk anIC Folk Club regular\nwhat Bob Pegg and \" Magic Lantern\" have in common.\nCertainly the same musical\ntastes, and a great mutual\nrespect, but the presentation\nof their music could hardly\nbe more different! or compare\nChris Rohmann and Nic Jones', they both stand up in\nfront of Folk Club audiences\nwith a guitar, a glass of beer,\nand wealth of talent, but their\nmusical styles have little\nin common!\nThe essential 'ingredient\nof those and all the other\nacts on the \" Folk Club Circuit\" must come down to\nthe old, indefinable \" Folk Club Atmosphere\". The top\nartists are those who can\nbring out the kind of atmosphere\nthat keeps the crowds coming\nback for more. At the end of\nthe evening there's nothing\nmore gratifying than an\naudience making it obvious\nthat they don't wont to go\nhome until they're sure there's no more ' till next week!\nIf you haven't been to a Folk Club before, why not\ngive it a try one Wednesday\nnight? Even if you don't like\nSteeleye' or Dylan, and you\nfeel ill every time the spinners\nappear on the box, you\nmight enjoy IC Folk Club!.... And so the lights go out,\nand a shadowy figure makes\nhis way out into the night\nto catch the last 49. It's been yet another good evening,\njudging by the cries for a third encore, and the guest\nhas been hinting that he'd like to play again next year.\nBut it's time to get back to\nreality, and think about\nLab reports, and tomorrows\ndinner, and things.

    "content": "mix SCAB : Who they are, what they do.\nIntroduction\nENTERTAINMENT IS NOT the sole aim of those\nclubs/societies that constitute the \" Social, Cultural\nand Amusements Board\"( SCAB). It is true that this\nis a common factor, that one way or another, at some\ntime or another, SCAB clubs do provide entertainment,\nthat this is what distinguishes SCAB from RC C and\nS CC because many of the SCAB clubs do have\nrecreational and social activities; it was only this\nterm that the Musical Society transferred to SCAB from RC C. Dramsoc are very socially orientated;\ngoing to the theatre or attending Hall Dinner is not\nunusual for them. Even IC Ents, the largest entertainment providers at College with three regular events a week (that's bordering on the industrial) cannot in\nfairness be accused of existing solely for these\npurposes.\nIt was for this reason that when SCAB was formed\njust over two years ago, it was not called the \" Entertaining Clubs Comittee\" ( E CC) to be in line with the\nother Union Major Sub-Committees, AC C,RC C,SC C. it became \u2014 although an unfortunate abbreviation in\nitself \u2014 it was felt that this title best embodied the\nactivities of those within it.\nHowever, having denied that SCAB clubs are solely\nentertainments based, I have not forgotten that\nentertainment is a common activity, nor will I claim\nthat SCAB has the monopoly in this field. The three\nCC U's,AC C,RC C,SC C,Hall s and Houses all provide\ntheir own entertainments. But entertainment is a luxury \u2014 an inexpensive luxury at IC \u2014 so go and\nsupport it, join a club, buy a ticket. Who knows you\nmay enjoy yourself.\nAlan R Jones\nEnts-a band of\ndedicated decadents\nTHE ENT(ERTAINMENT)S Committee is a body of\ndedicated decadents whose\nsole purpose is to make\nyour life more enjoyable.\nWe put on the Thursday\nfilms, Friday discos and\nSaturday concerts. The\ndisco now belongs to Ents\nand is hired out for parties\nwithin College. Membership of the committee\nis free, and Ents people get\ninto the events we put on\nfree. The catch, of course,\nis that members are expected\nto devote themselves body\nand soul to the organisation\nand running of entertainment\nwithin the College. For instance, a typical concert\ninvolves a large number of\nsimple but time consuming\ntasks such as sticking up\nposters, handbill ing concerts\nat inferior venues,\u201e selling tickets (thanks to Bill and\nJohn), humping equipment,\nkeeping out gatecrashers,\nclearing up afterwards and\noccasionally watching the\nband. However, as this\nwork is spread over the\nthirty-odd members of the\ncommittee the amount each\nindividual does is not\nexcessive, and would be\neven less if more people\njoined. We hold meetings\nevery Monday at 12.45pm in the Room at the Top, IC\nUnion, if you are-interested.\nJoining the committee\nis the best way of influencing\nthe type of entertainment\nwe provide; another way is to fill in the question al re\nin this supplement as fully\nand as intelligently as you\ncan. When doing this, please\nbear in mind what could be\ncalled the Jethro Zeppelin syndrome: when we ask what groups people would\nlike to see appearing at\nthe college they invariably\nask for the Rolling Floyd or\nsimilar. Unfortunately the\nsize of our hall, and the\nclose proximity of larger\nvenues, make bands costing\nmore than about \u00a31250 unwilling to play here, and\nanyway we would have to\ncharge ridiculously high\nadmission prices. I'd be\nespecially interested to\nhear suggestions for alternative\ntypes of entertainment; for\nexample, we used to run\nFriday night hops, with a small band and disco in the\nUnion Concert Hall; and\nCity University are experimenting with club/cabaret style evenings. I think that Ents serves a rather limited\nrange of interests at the\nmoment, and we really need\nyour ideas to widen the\nspectrum.\nAndy Hig man Ents Chairman\n\" Crimp ers\"6 Montpellier St.\n9.30am5.30 pm For free cut or styling, contact Roger at Crimpers.\nAny day, in cl.

In an\nattempt to achieve a balanced\nprogramme, some of the more\nworthy English dialogue films\nalso find inclusion in this\nseason's selection. The Society is a member\nof the British Federation of\nFilm Societies together with\nbeing a corporate member of\nThe National Film Theatre,\nthe latter entitling any member\nof Film Society to use our\nNational Film Theatre\nCorporate Membership Ticket.

The\nlanes at Heathrow have\nnumerous familiar ruts in\nthem while Portsmouth's lanes were superbly dressed\nand as most of use are\nun technical' c huq kers' they\ncame as rather a surprise,\n\u2022with balls wandering all\nover the lanes. The away\n-matches against Southampton\n\u2022and Brunei were a similar\nstory with most teams going\ndown by over 100 pins a game. Only the ladies were\nable to take a game from\nSouthampton. In the\nleague averages give witness\nto the fact that our standards\nare much higher than our\nmatch results would suggest.\nUnfortunately we always\nseem to bowl disastrously\nin these matches. Perhaps\nthis is due to the very relaxed\natmosphere on Wednesday, a situation which rarely arises\noo- matches, or perhaps it's not that we are bad but the\nop posit jon_ area j wav s better.\nIC tenpin bowling club\nhas changed quite markedly\nthis year, with IC and UC joining to form a University\nof London team. This 'has\nmainly been due to UC losing\nmost of their members and\ntheir joining our league.\nWhat UC lack in numbers\nhowever they make up for in-quality, with Derek Mills, Sid Wright and John Bagalini\nby Dave Zaborski\nalways able to command a place in the first team.\nThis year has also been\nnotable in that for the first\ntime to my knowledge we\nhave had a contingent from\nIF bowling at IC. Mansy,\nJulie and Sue are regular\nbowlers and we hope \"in time\nmore of our members will come from IF. Also we have\nbeen exceedingly fortunate\nin getting a ladies captain in\nform of Anne Holt who has\nbeen consistently good\nthroughout the season.\nHaving been beaten 10\u20140\nin all our matches vy e resolved\nto restore some lost face\nagainst Brunei at home. The\nfirst's and second's pushed\nthe opposition hard but lost\nnarrowly in all games.\nDerek had a particularly good\nmatch with a500 plus series\nand a198 third game. Rob,\nraised from third's to first' s, started with 180 but then\nsupped into our usual form.\nPaul was spasmodic, Clive bowled as usual and I was\ngetting a lot of practice at\nsplits. Apart from Derek we all ended up with sub-450 series;\nat least 50 too low for the\noccasion. John, Adrian, Cuff,\nRoger and John all bowled\nsimilarly in the second's, wb o, with admirable team\nwork lost narrowly in 2 games.\nThe third's of Simon, Pete,\nNigel, Paul and Steve took a game but lost overall. The\nladies once again saved our\ncomplete em baras s ment, decked in our new shirts and\nspurred mainly by a complete\ndislike of. the opposition\nthey took 2 games, the\nsecond by 4 pins which\npleased Brunei ladies no\nend. Anne bowled . with-admirable style curving the\nball into the head pin pocket\nenough times to keep Brunei\nworried. Julie and Briony in\nsimilar style sent the ball\nat a snails pace down the\nlane and watched the pins\nfall like the soldiers. Sue\nregularly scored, but then\nlooked so surprised when\nall the pins fell down. Mansy\nsimply bowled one immense\ncutter, after another. All the ladies raised their game\nfor the occasion, regular i ly picking up stray pins to keep\nahead of the opposition and\nwe finally won a point on\nthe UC TBA league. The\nresult 1-9, perhaps not good,\nbut improving.\nI would like to thank the\nladies and also anyone who\nhas regular i ly turned up for\nmatches, particular i ly the\nreserves.

You Don't!) 'Saturday 29th November\nand it's12.30 in the afternoon.\nImperial College Lacrosse club are at last leaving the\nBeit Quadrangle, one player\nshort, to travel d dW n to Morden\nto play St He lier. The match is\na flags match, which is a Knockoutcom pet it ion, analogous\nto the FA Cup, but of a somewhat lower standard.\nIt is now 2.30 on Sunday\nafternoon and this is what\nhappened. Well, London\nTransport once again demonstrated why they are viable\nalternative to private transport\nleaving us stranded on Stockwell tube station for\nhalf an hour. We were therefore\nabout half an hour late arriving\nat St He lier. At this juncture\nwe were asked, rather un sport in ly, to concede for being\nlate. On refusing to do so we\nwere given a\" Catch22\" proposition. If we played and\nlost, the match stood, otherwise\nSt He lier would claim victory,\nand report the game as a friendly. After a certain amount\nof hassling we finally started\nand played the match as a 'flags' match. In all fairness\nto the Captain of St Helier, it\nshou Id be said that he persona I ly\nwanted to play the match, but\nsome of h is more'' profess iona I\" players weren't so keen.\nSurprisingly the match\nstarted in fairly good humour.\nThis might possibly be due to\nthe fact that we conceded a goal in the first minute. Being\na man up, St Helier had a definite advantage, which\nthey used well, leading 5\u20140\nafter the first quarter. Finally our goalkeeper, Greasy Pete\nMacDonald, settled and then\nplayed like a demon. The\nDefence also worked hard\nhaving to mark an extra man,\nand thanks to a bit of luck and\ngood goal keeping, only gave\naway one goal in the next\nquarter, while the attack and\nmidfield, through Derek Senner,\nscored for IC. The score at\nhalf time was 6\u20141 to St Helier.\nDuring the second half IC\nagain worked hard, basically trying to keep the opposition\nscore rate to a minimum,\nwhile the attack attempted to\nFOOTBALL FAB LIA U Football Lower Reserve Cup\nBedford III 5\nImperial College V0 THE FIFTHS had the bad\nluck of drawing Bedford III\nin the first round of the cup,\nthey are unbeaten this season,\ntop of their division and the\ncup favourites.\nIn the first half, Bedford,\nmany of whose players\nappeared to possess a mental\nage of six, and sub-sere IQ\nratings, were surprised to\nfind Imperial wer re not the\nexpected push-over. Their\nfailure to dominate the play\nresulted in them overindulging in unsportsmanlike\ntactics such as kicking Tom\nShanks as he lay writhing in\nthe mud.\nThe score at half-time\nwas' 1\u20140 but with Imperial\nstill fighting hard and looking\ncapable of snatching victory.\nIn the second half Bedford\nbegan to put their game\ntogether and as Imperials\ndefence and mid field tired,\nthey hammered In a further\nfour goals. Despite the\nshoreline there was never\nmore than one goal between\nthe sides. The only difference\nbetween the teams being\nImperial's front runners\ninability to capital is e on the\nchances created by the hard\nworking midfield, whilst\nBedford (all credit to them),\ntook their chances when\nthey came, which is what\nthe game is all about. Bob\nBaldock seemed to have\nhis mind on other things\nsuch as \" Was there a mirror\nin the changing room?\" and\nRob Pavlov (Imperials'\nWalter Mitty) failed to live\nup to his pre-match forecast\nof being George Best\nreincarnated.\nAfter the match as Bedford\ncelebrated with double\nrations of rusks and warm\nmilk, a ray of light shone\ninto the life of Kim Whaley\nas the tea-girl actually spoke\nto him (poor, deprived lad,\nisn't used to such things).\ntake as many scoring chances\nas possible. However, these\nchances were few and far\nbetween because of St He lier' s one player advantage, which\nmeant they could always mark\nthe IC attack. Still the \" Happy Hacker\" did score from a solo\nrun, leaving the final score\n10\u20142 in St He lier' s favour.\nIC did very well to keep the\nscore as low as this against\na side who were relegated\nfrom the division above last\nseason ( and this only due to\ndifficulties in getting a squad.)\nand also. having a player\nadvantage. An extra player on\nIC's side would probably have\nmade this enjoyable and good\nhumour ed( once started) and a lot more even. Maybe one of\nthese days we'll get a full\nteem.\n\n"

Anyway, as\n'cross country report\", it does not\nlong as it is not entitled\nreally matter.\nWhat is it all about?\nPeople often ask me what\nan External Affairs Officer\ndoes;this is difficult to answer.\nEssentially, I suppose, the\njob involves the dissemination\nof information about, and the\nstimulation of student in vol v ment in,\" all matters external\nto IC\", that is, specifically concerning social and political\nissues. I am required to\nliaise with the NUS, and all its appendages such as End sleigh Insurance, NUS Travel, NUS Marketing, LSO etc, and with other colleges,\nHence I spend a great deal of\ntime going to meetings and\nconferences around the country\nand discussing various matters\nwith student union people in\nother colleges. To assist in\nthe pursuit of this brief, there\nis an External Affairs\nCommittee, (which can\naccommodate anyone interested\nin such matters).\nLSO etc\nThere are two bodies on\nwhich I represent the members\nof IC Union; one is the\nStudent Representative\nCouncil of the University of\nLondon Union, UL US RC, and\nthe other is the West London\nCommittee of the LSO. The\nlatter is the local Area\norganisation of the NUS. Since LSO is extremely\nlarge, it is split into a number\nof sub-areas. We belong to\nthe West London sub-area,\nwhich essentially contains\nall the colleges of USK and\nof the Brunei-centred equivalent,\nCAT BUMS. Well, if you followed\nall those initials, congratulations. So what are these organisations going to do for you?\nTo some extent that is up to\nyou, because I can only act\non the instructions of Council\nand Union General Meetings\n\u2014 and I suggest that you all attend UG M's and make your,\nopinions heard. At present,\nLSO( West London) are\nthinking about organising\ninter collegiate sports\ncompetitions within the area,\nand about producing 'ents\nsheets' as USK and CAT BUMS did. At the moment, there is\na great debate going on\nregarding the structure of\nLSO, mostly about finance,\nand also regarding the\nusefulness of the organisation.\nAt present, the LSO has\noccassional conferences to\ndiscuss political and social questions and to organise\ncampaigns, which are initiated\nby the NUS executive under\ninstructions from National\nConferences.\nDES Picket\nWhile on the subject of\ncampaigns, I would like to\nthank the handful of people\nwho turned out at midnight\nlast Thursday to take the\nfirst four-hour shift of the\n24-hour picket of the DES. We actually turned out 6\npeople, not including Trev\nPhillips, which outnumbered\nthe combined delegations of\nseveral other ex-USK colleges\nwho shall remain nameless. In\nthe absence of our banner (could\nwe have it back please?) we\nstood in the Arctic cold and\ngale force winds holding an\nNUS banner, which I thought\nwas rather incongruous since,\nas I said to Steve (\"Where's the bloody soup then?\")\nBrightman, IC has probably\nbeen d is affiliated from NUS for more years than most\nother colleges present had\nbeen affiliated!\nSo we sat/stood there and\nwatched the s ecu irt y guards\nand they watched us. Proceedings\nwere en livened by the activities of a local down-and-out. who\nfell around drinking anything\noffered (or not) until the\nfriendly local constabulary\noffered him accommodation\nfor the night. (I bet he got\nsome soup,) Whether or not we\nimpressed upon the DES that s ut dents are opposed to\nthe Drastic cuts in teacher\ntraining proposed by them,\nwe certainly discouraged\nanyone from entering the\nbuilding between midnight\nand four o 'clock.\nAt four, we went off with\nvarious people from Shoreditch,\nLiverpool (I'm sure they're\nnot in West London?!), Royal\nHolloway and Ealing for our\nmeal break. Well, South Bank\nPoly had shut down their\nsoup supplies, so we tried\nthe salubrious Mick' s Cafe in\nFleet Street, which was also closed, and then a place\nin Victoria and that too was\nclosed. I vaguely remember\nbeing driven into the new\nCovent Garden market, where\nPete told the chap on the\ngate (as he put his foot down\non the accelerator) that we'd come to collect a box of\napples. We returned to the\npicket at about 05.15am and\ndecided we had shown sufficient\nsolidarity for one night, so we\ngracefully retired to Charing\nCross to await the first tube.\nI hope that this tale encourages\nyou to come along and freeze\nnext time \u2014 I suppose you' ll find me there.\nServices\nThe latest idea to come\nout of NUS, and a good deal\nStay solvent this Xmas!

This can be obtained from your local social security office. The only\ncondition is that you must be available for work. You will be\nallowed a preference for type of work, but may be offered anything\nfor which the employment officer thinks you are suitable. An offer can be refused only for a genuine reason, for example,\nphysical disability( for manual work) or because the job is not\nwithin reasonable travelling distance,\nwork is available,\nIf no\nthen you will\" sign on\". If you are living at home\nduring the vacation, you must\ntake proof of your address,\nyour last bank statement, any\nsavings details and proof\nof the amount of your grant\nwhen you go to sign on.

    "content": "Wilson renames\nPhysics building\nLast Wednesday evening marked the occasion of the\nre-naming of the Physics building by the Prime Minister,\nMr Harold Wilson. The Physics building will now be known\nas the 'Blackett Laboratory' in commemoration of Lord\nBlackett former Fellow of Imperial College, who died\nlast year.\nMr Wilson was asked to\nattend the ceremony and give\nthe memorial lecture because\nhe had been a long standing\nfriend of Lord Blackett. Pat Blackett fought in\nWorld War 1 as a naval officer\nand was at Jutland when he\nwas only 19. Between the\nWars he worked with Rutherford\nwhen the foundations of\nnuclear and atomic physics\nwere laid. In World War 2, he\nan original \" b off in\" working\nin the early days of Operational\nResearch.\nAfter the War he became\ninvolved in what he called, the \"interface between\nScience and Technology and\nProductive Industry.\" He\nwas appointed to the newly\nset up NR DC by a young\nHarold Wilson and it was from this time that they grew\nto know each other well. Black et f's appointment caused controversy at the\ntime. He held unorthodox\nviews on World affairs,\nincluding questions on\nnuclear power and the need\n.for co-operation with the\nSoviet Union and other\ncountries to avoid the division of the World into major\nnuclear power blocks. He\nwas awarded, in 1948, the\nNobel prize for Physics. Pat Blackett served in the\nNR DC from 1 9 4 9 - 6 4 during\nwhich time the NR DC was built up into the large,\nsuccessful, profit-making,\norganisation that it is today.\nIn 1953, Lord Blackett\njoined IC, and was head of\nBomb scare\nExhibition Road was cordoned off at 2.45pm yesterday because a bomb\nwarning. Someone found that\ntheir car had been tampered\nwith and phoned the police. Fortunately, there was no\nbomb and traffic was moving\nagain by 3.20pm. the Physics Department until\n1963, building up the Department and playing a major\nrole in the expansion of\nImperial College. With others,\nincluding Gaits kill, Alf Robens and Brownowski,\nduring the 13 years of Labour\nopposition, he helped form\npolicies which after the '64\nelection became Labour's \"white-hot technological\nrevolution\". In the capacity of advisor\nto successive Ministers of\nTechnology, Frank Cousens\nand Tony Benn, Pat Blackett\nbecame the saviour of the\nBritish computer industry,\nmainly through protectionism.\n(This policy would to-day\nbe forbidden by the EEC). A champion of egalitarianism,\nPat Blackett declined an\ninvitation to go to the Lord's in the early sixties, but\nwas finally persuaded to\nbecome a life peer in 1969.\nFrom Mr Wilson's lecture,\nPat Blackett appeared with\nwar mtn as an idealist, but\nalso as intensely practical. He played a central role in\nthe move during the 6 0 ' s, toward more technically knowledgable management\nand the end of \" amateurism\". He was born in 1897, his life covered the development\nof practically all of modern\nscience, indeed he helped\nshape much of it.

Mr Grimond, who is a member * of Parliament for\nOrkney and Shetland, visited\nthe College at the invitation\nof the Liberal Club. He\ngave vent to his personal\nviews on the present state\nof British politics. He saw\nthe present tur bu lance as\na chance for a new beginning\nfor our whole governmental\nsystem. There was, he said, an opportunity for a complete\nre-think of our institutions,\nfrom the Civil Service through\nIndustry to Universities and Government.\nMr Grimond who favours\ndevolution of power to the\nnew Welsh and Scottish\nassemblies wanted this\ntrend carried further. Services\nsuch as education he thought\ncould be managed by\ncommunities rather than by\nlocal authorities and central\ngovernment.\nIn what amounted to a power to the people speech,\nMr Grimond said that the political arena consisted of\npower blocks and pressure\ngroups rather than parties\nrepresenting sectional interests.\nThis was more akin to the\nsituation that existed in\nmedieval times and he called\nfor a new look at the ways\nin which our policies were\nbeing formulated.\nTHEFTS\nPersonal property le wallets, purses, bags, cheque\nbooks, cards, pocket calculators etc have been stolen\nfrom lecture rooms, workshops, etc throughout the college\nin recent weeks.\nSome outside intruders have been arrested but events\nshow that thieves are still on the prowl visiting unattended\nplaces with intent to steal.

    "content": "Fit IX\nKM\nFOR THOSE IN doubt,\npossibly due to the a bsc en ce of my column in the last few\neditions of FELIX, ICWA\nhas been alive and well\nsince I last put pen to\npaper! Firstly, on the negative\nside, I must explain why the\nRape Debate was cancelled.\nThe idea of the debate was to\nencourage constructive and\nobjective discussion of the\npresent rape law and the\ndile ria that the law faces in\nthe case of rape. It was felt\nthat this could not possibly\nhappen in the justifiably\nhigh pitched atmosphere\ncreated by the rape of a girl\nat knife point in the Union\nBuilding, only a week before\nthe debate was due to have\ntaken place. Hence, the\ndebate was cancelled.\nIn the lunch break of\nThursday, November 20th, ICWA held its first General\nMeeting of the session. This\nproved to be a tactical error*\nas an ICU UGM was also\nscheduled for that lunch\nbreak. However, thanks to\nthe very poor turn out for\nthe meeting, we had no\ntrouble in whizzing through\nthe agenda, electing for\nourselves a very capable\nfresher s' rep and male rep\nand still managing to attend\nthe major part of the UGM.\nOn the evening of the\n20th November the Post\nGraduate and Overseas\nStudents Social evening was\nheld from which insights\nwere gleaned as to just how\nisolated some of these\nstudents really are. As a result we have devised a strategy for ensuring every\none of our PG and overseas\nmembers know about the\nevents being organised.\nAs for future events, we\npropose to round off the\nterm in true Christmas spirit\nwith the 'traditional' ICWA\nChristmas luncheon to be\nheld on December 9th in the\nUnion Concert Hall. Tickets\ncost 50p and can be purchased\nfrom ICWA department reps\nor from Beit Hall, rooms 121,\n124 and 30. We look forward\nto seeing you there.\nFinally, although College\ngoes down for the Christmas\nvac on December 12th, most\nschools and sixth form colleges\ndo not break up until much\nlater. This provides a ready\nopportunity for students\nto visit their old sixth\nforms, with a view to giving\na short careers talk to\nencourage girls to read\nfor science and engineering\ndegrees \u2014 particularly at\nIC. It is not as awesome\nas it sounds \u2014 most sixth\nformer s are more than willing\nto listen to what you have to\nsay. If you are willing to do\nthis, and this request is by\nno means restricted to ICWA\nmembers, let me know so that\nyou can be provided with\nsome of the relevant bump h.A better male/female ratio\nin this college would benefit\nboth parties (did somebody\nsay a party ?!) So please give\nthe idea some consideration.\nStella Godfrey\nWomen in science\nand engineering\nnot a contradiction\nThe advantage of the\nemotions is that they lead us\nastray, and the advantage of\nscience is that it is not\nemotional \u2014 Oscar Wilde.\nWOMEN IN science and\nengineering is, to many\npeople, a contradiction in\nterms. Either they are not\ntrue women, or not true\nscientists arid engineers.\nThe first lesson you learn\nwhen you decide to study\nengineering is how to react\nwhen people discover this\nintention. It is something I have never mastered. When\npeople smile sweetly and\nsay, 'But you look much too\nfeminine to do engineering!,\nI generally pull myself up to\nmy full 5ft2 in s and glower\nat them, or I smile sweetly\nback and murmur, 'engineering\ndegrees aren't as physically demanding as people imagine;\non a good day I can carry\nmy own books...'\nThe constant teasing is very worrying, especially if you are not a good engineer.\nPerhaps this is my whole\nproblem, but it certainly\nirritates me greatly when\npeople suggest I am too short\nto undertake the rig ours of\na BSc( Eng).\nIt is in connection with\nMutters Arising Still recovering from the\neuphoria of a Mike Williams\n(gasp) profile, I am afraid\nthis 'Mutters' will not so much fly off the pen, as\nstagger off it. There are\ntwo things which need\nsaying.\nFirstly, a working party\non \" ways in which the\nUnion's administration can be made more responsive to\nthe needs of the membership,\npresent- and future\" has been\nset-up. This grand brief\nencompasses an enormous\nfield, but if you feel that\nthe Union lets you down in\nany sphere, be it in clubs,\nacademic affairs, ac com mod ation, or whatever, then let\nus know.\nThe working party consists of Peter Teague, Ri z Shakir,\nJohn Morgan and myself. If\nyou don't grumble now, your\nchance of making any great\nchanges this year has gone.\nSecondly, it is likely that,\nin the near future, stringent\nrules relating to the placing of\nposters in Union areas' will be introduced. These will be advertised beforehand, but\nyou have been warned! On a similar note, will any group\nadvertising in the hallowed\nportals of IF please take the\nposters down to their Union\noffice first. The point here\nbeing that their administration\nare not very keen on posters\nbeing put up just inside the\nfront door, thus covering up\nthe fire exit poster.\nYours (lovingly as ever)\nJohn Downs\nthis and with \"Women and\nScience\" collective that led\nme to join the 'Women in\nScience and Technology'\ngroup. This controversial\ngroup has received more\nabuse than all the other\nsocieties put together \u2014\neven ICWA has not received\nthat much abuse \u2014 and it is sad to note that most of It\nunearned. All the women's activities that are the wrong\nside of Barbara Cartland are\nput down to us. The newly\nelected Mr ICWA even accused\nus of being responsible for\nthe Smoking Concert picket.\nIn addition, for reasons\nknown only to herself, she found the Rape Debate\nposter offensive.\nIt is attitudes like these\nwhich have caused many\npeople to ignore the activities of our group or dismiss them\nas unimportant.This is a great\npity because our group is very active, and has some\nexcellent meetings planned.\nOne of our main aims this\nyear is to meet successful women scientists and engineers to discuss their\ncareers and the difficulties\nthey faced reaching the top\nof their professions. The most interesting of these\nencounters should be the\none with Eleanor Macdonald\nwho runs the 'Women In\nManagement' group and is a very successful Industrialist\nherself.\nOur Wednesday meetings\ncontinue in the ICWA lounge\nas before, but on a slightly\nmore formal basis. The meetings usually deal with\naspects of a science and\nwomen\". It is important to stress\nthat anyone is welcome to\nthese meetings. Come along\nany Wednesday and meet us \u2014\nwe are not all raving feminists\nand male haters \u2014 some\nwomen survive three years\nof this college without\nemerging with a phobia\ntowards all things masculine.\nPROF BREMSSTRAHLUNG\nHello!

Since 1921, when the Society united by anti-aircraft fire from Hyde Park, during an air-with \" The Royal College of Science Musical Society\" raid). 1956 saw the opening of the new Union building;\nto put on their first full-length play - Sheridan's the Society took over the Concert Hall, on the second\n\" A School for Scandal\" - two productions have been floor, where it has remained ever since, apart from an\ngiven every year. In 1941 the Society was reformed as adventurous performance of TS Eliot's \"Murder in\n\" The Imperial College Union Dramatic Society\" and the Cathedral\" the Great Hall.\nOur two productions\ntake place in the penultimate\nweeks of the Autumn and\nSpring terms, and are generally\nadvertised widely, both in\nthe College and outside.\nAuditions take place in the\nfirst and last weeks of the\nAutumn term. Parts are then\nspeedily learnt so that\nrehearsals can begin in\nearnest; these are held on\nSunday afternoons and\nevenings and on two evenings\nin the week (generally\nTuesday and Thursday).\nNaturally not all the cast\nare required at every rehearsal.\nThe Society usually\nselects a director who has a play he wants to direct,\nalthough this is not always\npossible. Aspiring directors\nare rare and we are always\non the look-out for new\ntalent. On occasions the\ndirector may choose to\norganise a workshop session for the actors \u2014 either in\nmovement or in improvisation \u2014\none of their functions is\nto help the actors get to\nknow one another.\nIn recent years our\nproductions have ranged\nfrom the medieval (three\nmystery plays) to the up-to-date (Tom Stoppard's\" The Real Inspector Hound\"); from the stark reality of\nArthur Miller's\" The Crucible\" to the absurdity of \" The Bald Prima Donna\" by\nEugene lone sco. The presentation of two\nplays each year are but the\ntip of the iceberg of Dramsoc's manifold activities. Behind\nthe scenes \"there are numerous\ntechnical jobs to be done,\nand services to be provided\nfor social functions.

Aside from the\nelectrics there are, of course,\nsets and properties to be\ndesigned and constructed,\nrequiring a large number of\npeople to saw, hammer and\nwield paint brushes. Outside\nthe Society our technical\nexpertise, lighting and sound\nequipment is lent to a variety of Carnivals, concerts,\ndances and private parties,\nculminating in the annual\nRCS formal ball at Silwood\nPark. We also provide\nmaterials, tools and some of\nthe manpower for the Operatic\nSociety's February Show.\nThe Society would find\not hard to exist without the\ncontributions made by girls\nfrom IF. As well as providing\nactresses they are able to\nhelp in the active wardrobe\nana make-up departments.\nThey also join us in our\nfrequent visits to London\ntheatres \u2014 both professional\nand amateur.

As well as providing a change\nof scenery, the tour gives\nthe members a chance for a little relaxation. We perform\nin both schools and public\nhalls which we hire for\ntwo or three nights.
