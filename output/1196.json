    "content": "Singles Again!! by Nick Norm and Andy Winner! Muse\nPlug in Baby\n(Mushroom)\nA fierce return from the Tim \u00a7 |\nBuckley plagiarists. Crashing guitars,\nfull on re verb and a spirit that spits\nbile in your face. Muse are a changed\nband. This year they could well brae k from the Radiohead shadow, and be a very interesting prospect. London shows in Brixton have been lined up\nfor early spring, book your front row\nseats soon, as it's sure to sell out.\nLlama Farmers\nNote on the door\n(Beggars Banquet)\nThese guys are so cuddly, bless their\nlittle cotton guitars. For a British\nband, they sound incredibly American, dropping vowels all over\nthe place, frightful. The song doesn't really grab you, not as good as some\nof their previous efforts, but it's OK.I have to say I have a real problem\nwith liking bands that are younger\nthan me...\nHatiras E Spaced Invader | jp| Rae and Christian\nGet A Life\n(Studio K7)\nNot in the same league as\nmassively revered hit\nSpellbound. There are some exciting and trip py bass beats coupled\nwith some interesting soul vocals\nprovided by Bobby Womack. Unfortunately, they fail to fit\ntogether in the overall wash of the\ntune.\ntheir Bryoni Lynch, you\nare a legend!\nNot only have you won the\nNME Carling Awards Leather\nJacket (RRP \u00a3 150), but also\nyou\nKings of\n(Defected)\nA great dance tune to get into the\nnew year with. Comedy lyrics with\nand quality bass line in arag ga style,\nthis one is gunn a stick in your head\nuntil you get bored, fed up and snap\nthe CD over your knee. Darren Emerson's Underwater Mix shines\nthrough.\nConvenience Winning a Battle,\nLosing the War\n(Source)\nIt would be so easy to rip this\napart, just like the others. Some barbed attack on their sensitivity,\nthe fact that they probably got\nthe shit kicked out of them on a regular basis at rugby practice. I might use Alan McGee' s priceless\ninsult, \"bed wetter s\". But I can't, because it's just so damn be a uti ful. The simple harmony of two\nmen with two guitars, singing a sad but slightly hopeful song. It\nstands, prettily nervous, somewhere between Simon and Garfunkel and Coldplay. \"Even\nthough I 'll never need her\", they\nsing, \"even though she's only giving me pain / I 'll be on my knees\nto feed her, spend the day to\nmake her smile again\". These are\nplain sentiments made glorious by their verisimilitude. This is the\nfirst time today I have heard anything I believed, and it feels good.\nget to go on a date with\nTom, Andy and Drew. You\nlucky minx! Pop into the Felix\noffice to collect your jacket c' greatness, and you too could\nlook as good as this lady on\nthe left. Assuming you don't already, of course. Although\ngive us a week to organise it's delivery.\nRunners up will be informed by\nemail in due course. Thanks to\neveryone who entered. It was,\nof course, Queens of the\nStone Age who were NME's album of the year.\nSmut Peddlers\nPorn Again\n(Rawkus)\nI cannot deny the rumor that I only listened to this album because\nof the title and more importantly the X rated promotional sheet (I am selling this if any of you sick and desperate boys are interest-ed... bids kick off at a fiver). Having never encountered this hip-hop\noutfit before I was ready to be influenced and certainly had an open\nmind.\nThe first couple of tracks definitely don't come at you the way I hoped they might have done. The slow build up and tame lyrics really didn't inspire the soul. This aside, the mood is then livened up\nwith the middle of the album. The beats get heavier and more\nuplifting and the energy and enthusiasm of the vocals leads you to\nlisten on. At this point the whole thing falls flat on its face and the\nexperience falls as flat as its start.\nNot bad, but you would get fed up listening to tracks four and\nfive over and over again.\nNick Ho/I Felix \u2022 29th January 2001\n\n"

    "content": "Fe \u00a3 IX Science in Brief Deadly Virus Created In\nMice, Could Humans See\nThe Same?\nScientists in Canberra, Australia accidentally created an aggressive and deadly mouse\nvirus last week that some worry could produce\nmicrobes deadly to humans. The virus formed\nwhen a mouse immune system gene was added to the mouse pox virus in an attempt to\ndevelop a contraceptive to control rat and\nmouse plagues. The result was the creation\nof a virus capable of killing many different\nbreeds of mice, even those previously immune\nto mouse pox. Dr. Bob Seamark, director of\nthe Cooperative Research Center for the\nBiological Control of Pest Animals found that\nvaccines for mice which normally prevent\nmouse pox were also rendered substantially\nweaker against this viral strain.\nThe key concern is obviously not for lab\nrodent populations but for humans. Scientists\nat the center say that the mouse virus itself\nposes no danger to people, but that \"this\nsame modification could be made to human\nviruses and this would enhance their virulence\nor at least (strengthen) their ability to kill pe o ple\" Sea mark said. Responsibility is key.\n\"Discoveries such as this are being made all\nthe time,\" said Dr. Annabelle Duncan, chief of\nmolecular science at the Australian govern-ment' s Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization, \"The important thing is to ensure they are used for good,\nnot for destructive purposes.\" She has urged\na stronger Biological Weapons Convention, a treaty ratified by some 140 nations pledging\nnot to develop or stockpile biological weapons.\nGalapagos Oil Slick\nWorsens\nThe huge oil slick near the Galapagos Islands, which started oozing from a grounded\noil tanker nearly a week and a half ago, was\nft/\nSite of Oil S pili exacerbated this past weekend by pounding\nsurf which broke open new holes in the ship's hull. The spill has now spread over more than\na1,200 square kilometer (460 square mile)\narea. \"The environmental damage is extremely grave\" said Ecuadorian Environment Minister Rodolfo Rendon who is deeply con-cern ed about the area's unique insects, plants, birds, and reptiles( particularly Darwin' s Finches and the Galapagos Tortoise). Pollution experts from the US coast guard have been dispatched to protect\nthe wildlife refuge, but even with the aid of\nthe world's best the situation does not look\ngood at all.\nWater Beneath the\nMartian Crust\nWater may have recently flowed on Mars says Harry McS we en from the University of\nTennessee. While, abundant evidence in the\nform of surface features suggests that water\nwas once extremely abundant on the planet,\nsamples of volcanically formed rocks from the\nred planet show little sign of having solidified\nfrom magma that was once rich in water. However, analysis of a meteorite from the red\nplanet known as the Shergotty, suggests that\nthe planet had a warmer wetter past. McS we en's team has shown that the mete\nor it e contains many water soluble elements in\nthe interior compared to those in the outer\nskin. The team's hypothesis is based on the\nlogic that the interior of the meteor is similar j in composition to the interior of the planet and\nthe exterior of the meteor similar to Mars'\nwater poor crust.\nFalkland Island Fire\nSeverely Damages Fragile I Eco-System\nA five day fire caused by exploding am muni| tion on the Falkland Islands is feared to have i lead to the deaths of thousands of|\nRockhopper penguins and albatross. Tha\nblaze began on January 12 as British Troops\nwere exploding ordnance from two Argentine,\nplanes downed in the war with the UK \\i years ago. The fire laid waste to the small\nnature preserve known as South Jason Island]\nabout 4 8 0 km (300 miles) northeast of the\nsouthern tip of South America. Adult penguins might have been able to flee the flames\nbut chicks at this time of year have not yet\nbecome mobile and were likely burnt to death.\nFire crews did however witness burnt)\nRockhopper penguins crawling from the dev-a station. As if the physical blow dealt to the\nseabirds on the island was not bad enough.\n90% of the tus sac grass supporting the avian\npopulation was destroyed and will take al\nleast 3 years to recover. Sadly, this fire only\naggravates an already grave situation for the\nnature reserve which has experienced a30)1 decline in bird populations over the past two\ndecades.\nScience 29th January 2001 \u2022 Felix\n\n"

    "content": "frequency BS2000\nSimply Mortified\n(Grand Royal)\nBS2000 is the side project of\nBeastie Boy, Adam Horovitz and\ntour DJ Amery Smith. With credentials like that, I was expecting something pretty special, maybe a bit hip-hop, maybe a bit punk. What you get\nis neither of those, and is like nothing I have heard before. If comparisons must be made, it sounds like\nBis on acid.\nThe tracks are mainly short, upbeat ditties, played on a synthesis er, while someone plays along on\ndrums in the background. There is a very underground feel to this, and no\ndoubt that is the intention. Some of\nthe songs are great fun, cute little\npop numbers. My favourites are Yeari / like BS and The Side to Side.\nSome of them are just plain strange.\nThere is no doubt that this is very\nexperimental. I feel the band is just\nplaying around trying to get some\ninspiration, rather than trying to\nmake good songs. There are high-lights, particularly the first few tracks, but the good bits don't last\nlong enough to make this album\ngreat.\nTom Bailess\nSpooks\nS.I.O. S.O.S. Volume One\n(Artemis)\nSpooks are an American hiphop act consisting of a female singer and four male rap-per s, or perhaps that should be a female singer, three male rappers\nand one obscure alien hybrid who\nat one stage insists that he's actually \"two guys multiplied by\n93 guys\". Well I believe him any-way. If you're wondering what\nS.I.O. S.O.S. stands for, I'm afraid\nyou'll have to keep on wondering.\nAs for the music, two tracks\nstand out in particular. The polished Things I 've Seen has a catchy chorus and a good bass\nline, and the fact that it's their\ncurrent single would surprise no-one. But perhaps the best track\non the album is Karma Hotel,\nwhich boasts another smooth, addictive chorus, a clever chord\nprogression and a rapped storyline that really makes you listen\nto the lyrics as our \"hero\" gets\ninvolved in a game of Russian\nroulette.\nThere are also a couple of\nchanges in tempo and style worth\nmentioning. Sweet Revenge is far\nmore laid-back than the rest of\nthe album, with a relaxed beat\nand flowing vocals. Meanwhile,\nSwindley's Maracas has a latino\nfeel and though it's not bad in\nitself, the one-track change in\nstyle doesn't quite work.\nMost of the other tracks have\na good beat and the odd interesting feature. However, there's still\ntoo much of your average, predictable hip-hop fare with little\nmelodic interest, lots of repetition\nand several hundred expletives.\nAn interesting skit sequence\nruns through the whole album, in\nwhich a promoter tries to convince each individual member of\nthe group that the other four have\nfar less talent and should be\ndumped. This serves to add variety as well as being humorous.\nS.I.O. S.O.S. Volume One is\ncertainly an impressive album,\nthough you'd have to be a big fan\nof the genre for it to become an\nessential purchase.\nDave Edwards\nLowfinger\nWho's Cot The Biscuits?\n(Elemental)\nOn reflection, definitely not similar\nto Black Grape as somebody sa\u00ab\nto me. Certainly not. Lowfinger are\nway too experimental and sober to\nbe compared with Shaun Ryde;s~ sad attempt at a comeback. Therv-ea balls-out (even the girl) rock band\nwith an emphasis on blasting ou\nsome quality, funky tunes. There's, an unhealthy interest in fingers\n(Super Finger, Airfinger, Pulling\nWith The Fingers, Beach Finger\nand I don't doubt for a minute tha\nit's dirty. But hey, what's a fun-lov\ning group of kids doing if there's no\nsome fascination with body part\nsomewhere? If this is the shape o things to come this year, then it's going to be a cracker.\nChristian\nMy Vitriol\nFinelines\n(Infectious)\nThe long awaited debut album\nfrom the \"hardest working band in British music\" is finally here, the\nwait has been well worth it. From\nstart to finish, the sonic assault is\nrelentless, both shimmering and\nfull-on, neck throttling buzzing guitar riffs, thundering drums and\nmore hooks than you can shake a stick at. This is eclecticism meets\npop meets rock all in one. Thel\ninfluence of Sonic Youth, My\nBloody Valentine and Nirvana are\never present. The highlights of the\nalbum are without a doubt the sin-g les, Cemented Shoes, Pieces\nand the re-released Always: You''\\\nWay.

    "content": "Equal Opportunities vs The World\nLily Macey, Equal Opportunities officer\n1^ role at ICU\nI doubt if many of you even knew that there\naS s uch a thing as an equal opp s officer at ICU\nr ll Ch less what they do when they're there. Well I.q; y knew that there was one when I lost out to a ert a in president's sexist views just before the ill\u20223ted SNK PJ Rag Week 2000. The equal opp s, ff ice r is the person at the union who, with the\nie lp of my fellow welfare officers, stands up to\nallege, other union officials and union members\nbehalf of anyone who feels that they are not\neing treated fairly in any way. So basically I hang\nround, adjusting the union Equal opp s policy and\nvia i)t until someone has a problem. Fortunately at\nlC L'N ot many people seem to.\nwould like to have a small rant now and in\nan ting issues (when Stef has space) about the\ni flings that make me angry. The reading of which\nnay help to describe the concept of Equal\nOpportunities a bit more clearly.\nEqual Opportunities Vs Positive Discrimination\nPositive discrimination is not positive at all and I hope to illustrate this by the way of two short\n\u2022x ample s from recent media.\nIn the run up to Christmas I happened upon a mall article in the Daily Mail (must be true) about\nome strange goings on in a Labour Council bor-l ugh in London. According to the article the\nCouncil officials had decided not to put up the tra-lit ional street Christmas decorations and had\nalso asked the workers in the council building its\nself to \"keep Christmas celebrations and decorations to a minimum\". The reason given for this surprising sc rouge ry was to avoid \"offending non\nChristians\". Now, imagine if you will that the exact\nsame council had asked an ethnic minority - a \"non Christian\" culture if you will - to \"Tone Down\"\ncelebrations of a major religious, festival. There\nwould have been outrage, a front-page story not\njust a crappy two inches at the bottom of the current affairs summary. \"Racist Scandal in London\nBorough\", \"Oppression of Minority's beliefs\" or\nsome thing along those lines. Here the headlines\nshould have read \"Oppression of Majority's beliefs\" because that is basically what positive discrimination is about the discrimination against the\nmajority.\nAnother example of a situation where positive\ndiscrimination is rife is human resources. This is\ncaused mainly government pressure to improve\nemployment statistics. If a company is only\nemploying white males then it is considered racist\nand fined or taken to court. This is also true of\neducational institutions. Ever wondered why there\nseems to be more and more girls at IC year upon\nyear? There has been a steady increase in numbers from the days when it was a men only col-leg e.A silly and hugely over exaggerated example of such discrimination is a Hale and Pace\nsketch. It is set in a boardroom meeting of a big\ncompany between the main heads of manage-ment. The topic of conversation is the forthcoming\nexpansion and the need to recruit more staff to\naccommodate the change. The purpose of the\nmeeting is to decide what qualities these new\nstaff would have, in order to decide this they consult a report from the human resources department which details the current workforce ethnic i ty, sex and disability statistics. The report shows\nthat the work force is severely lacking in mentally\ndisabled Japanese women. There fore the motion\nis carried to give preferential employment to mentally disabled Japanese women. Needless to say\nthat the actual attributes of the prospective\nemployees that would be beneficial to the job in\nhand were not discussed at all.\nAlthough this is a comedy sketch which has\ndoubtlessly lost much of its comedy in it's retelling\nhere by me it is based however loosely on the\ntruth. Companies and Colleges should not choose\nemployees or students on a pick and mix basis\njust to satisfy the demands of an equality\nobsessed government. When in actual fact in\ndoing so they are discriminating against deserving\npeople.\nEqual Opportunities means just that, Equal.\nNot artificially created and improved opportunities\nfor anyone majority or minority at the expense of\neveryone else. Create opportunities and encouragement. Allow everyone to have chances and\nthen on their own merit allow to advance them-selves. Having flexibility in the work place, giving\neveryone equal opportunities and equal access to\nequal representation for their individual rights.\nEXTRA COSTS When out-competing ICU for the right to run a bookshop in the college, Waterstones promised\nthat the Imperial College branch would become\ntheir flagship academic store. Waterstones bookshops at university campuses have been the sublet of complaints by students who find that textbooks are more expensive in these stores than in\n\u2022Vaterstones branches on high streets. The company has accepted the student's observations and\nexplained that as the sales of text books were\nhigher in the university branches, price increases\neffected by publishers would inevitably be passed\n* more quickly to customers in these branches.\nKevin has also noticed that there are no second\ni hand books for sale in the on campus store, unlike\nja t their Mallet Street and other stores.\nI EGAL REFUSAL Orange have recently begun to refuse students\nMobile phone contracts, solely on due to the fact\n'hat they are students. One Carphone warehouse\nManager confused as to why one of is customers\n\"as being consistently turned down by Orange,\nSystematically adjusted the credit check form until\n1\n\u00b0e came clear that it was the word student in the\n\u00b0C cup ation box that was causing the problem,\n^ange deny preventing students from accessing\ntheir products, pointing to their ranges of contract\nservices set up specially targeted at students.\nHowever Carphone warehouse senior sales managers are convinced the problem is real, and have\nbeen threatening to stop dealing- with Orange\nshould they continue their discriminatory policy.\nINEFFECTIVE COMMUNICATION This year residences have a shortage of rooms\nwhich are in halls which are open over Easter.\nSome International students needing to stay in\nA mostly libellous column. Kevin is a random entity who knows nothing about nothing\nhalls over the holiday period have been accommodated in Southside, and are moving to Evelyn\nGardens for Easter. In a typical example of one\npart of college not coordinating its activities with\nanother, there is a four night gap between the end\nof the Residences' license period at Southside,\nand the first date at which rooms in Evelyn\nGardens are available when booked through the\nConference Office. Kevin has been told that the\nroot of the problem was due to: \"Easter occurring\nat an unusual time this year,\" and assured that\n\"something would be sorted out\".\nSTRANGE SNOW Last week Kevin noticed that the snow falling in\ncollege appeared to be slightly abnormal. The\nSnowflakes appeared to be elongated and had a stringy appearance. Apparently the mutant snow\nwas yet another consequence of the huge amount\nof general muck and grime in the London atmosphere, this particular effect being attributed to\ndetergents in the atmosphere. With the effect of\nthe polluted atmosphere being so apparent with\nthe snowflakes, Kevin wonders what it is doing to\nhim.\nADVENTURES WITH BAGPUSS Currently Bagpuss is safely curled up in\nDramSoc's cupboard, but is apparently restless to\nget out. Current ideas over the future of the huge\ncat seam rather tame, some however have more\npotential such as seeing how often we could get it\nto appear on the television news. Kevin believes\nthat the cat could be used to maximum comedy\nand RAG earning potential on a grand tour of\nLondon Landmarks.\nmishmash@ic.ac.uk\n\u2022 Felix \u2022 29th January 2001 \u2022 Columns/Union\n\n"

    "content": "Has it been what you expected?\nIt hasn't, you expect certain things, I expected it to be challenging, and at\ntimes it's as much of a challenge as I thought, but sometimes it goes\nbeyond that and it's also one of those\nbizarre jobs that gives you a unique\nfeeling. It's difficult to really describe,\nbut it's what you expect, and it's not.\nIt's more work than you think, there's more time to be ploughed in than you\nnaturally think, but it's also reward-ing; you expect it to be rewarding,\nthough it's, some days, when you've\nhelped somebody solve a problem, or\nyou've ended an issue that's been\ngoing on quite a while, and it makes\nyou have a warm glow, that you've\naccomplished something. It's very\nstrange, it's very cathartic.\nWhat are the main challenges you Ve faced this year?\nDon't know how successfully we've\nmanaged them, but, Wye coming on\nboard, so many hundred students,\nquite far away from the main cam-p uses, also the increased amount of\nrepresentation we have on Postgrad\ncommittees; it's been a complete\nnightmare trying to find post grads to\nfill the roles, though we have, well,\nthe majority of them.\nWhat would you say are the qualities\nthat make a good D P(E&W)? I think you have to be someone who\ncan listen, someone who enjoys lis-ten ing, ask the proper questions\nwhich gets more information out of\nthem. Someone who cares, someone\nwho basically can often see the wider\npicture but also can focus on the individual's needs.\nWhat do you think would be the main\nchallenges for your successor?\nI think it could be interesting, with the\nway educational funding is, and with\nthe potential for certain departments\nto be in deficit for quite a considerable amount of time, I think a serious\nnumber of departments will be laying\noff staff. It's something to remember\nand keep an eye on, and ensure that\nthe teaching and learning is always\nmaintained at the high standards.\n\"You have to be\nsomeone who can\nlisten.\"\nYou've been Editor for six months\nnow, has it been what you expected\nso far?\nI knew it would be a lot of work, and\nit's been even more than I expected,\nbut it's also been a lot more fun, a lot\nmore stressful, a lot more challenging\nand a lot more worth it than I thought\nit would be. What I didn't expect was\nhow the two groups I work with -Union and Felix people - would play\nsuch a huge role in my life. I'm really\nlucky to work with such a cool, enthusiastic and talented Felix team.\nWhat have been your main challenges this year?\nAs you might have guessed; getting\nthe issue out on time has been a nightmare- my first issue coming out\ntwo days late was my biggest night-mare, and things all went f loopy straight after Christmas, but are\nhopefully getting better.\nUnfortunately the nature of the job\nmeans that things go wrong which\nare out of my control for which I get\nthe blame- it's just something you\nhave to live with. Keeping everyone\nhappy is always going to be hard, but\nas long as someone comes to talk to\nme we usually manage to sort things\nout.\nWhat would you say were the qualities that make a good Editor?\nTact and listening skills are imp or tant, as people are going to tell you\nthings, and you have to be very careful to distinguish what they want you\nto print from confidential; sometimes\nit's a subtle difference. Organisational\nskills are preferable, but not essen-ti al.I think persuasion, ability to listen\nand knowing when to strike and when\nto be quiet. You need a sense of\nhumour, definitely.\nWhat would be your advice for someone considering standing for Editor?\nI know I sometimes sound a bit pes-simi stic but if you can do the job, do.\nIt's been very tough sometimes, but\nI 've never regretted it.\n\"I'm really lucky to\nwork with such a cool, talented Felix\nteam.\"\nYou've been President for six months now, has it been what you\nexpected so far?\nYeah, it's been everything I expected\na\"d probably more...It's proved aye ry hard job, there have been lots\n\u00b0f Problems over the year. Becky did\na fantastic job last year, sorting out\na lot of\nthe course, but it's been hard\nWork challenging but I 've absolutely\n'0 v ed it so far, and I'm only upset I'm n \u00b0t allowed to do it two years run-ning.\nWhat would you say your main chal-Ses have been?\n^Orr irn uni cation. With the merger it'seen very difficult to reach everyone\noutside of the now huge sized campuses we now have, out towards\nCharing Cross, Hillingdon and\nNorthwick Park, so reaching every-one, letting them know what's going\non, who they can talk to, what's going on at home base and such has\nbeen difficult, but hopefully we've\nworked around that by building up\nthe webpage and newsletter, because the old methods of posters\nand word of mouth aren't good\nenough any more.\nSo what were your main aims when\nyou took on the job?\nTo try and maintain the medics'\nethos within what is now a very big\nCollege structure.

His family\nhas a reputation for reckless bravery and heroism in war, but their\nfortunes have been declining for\ndecades, so that they were no\nlonger the powerful Celtic clan\nwho gave their name to Mannville,\nOhio. With Eddie's death it seems\nthe Mann dynasty will end with his\nfather Thomas, a reclusive alcoholic and architect of the ill fated\nbusiness venture which cost the\nfamily their money and their respected place in society. Then a baby is abandoned on Thomas's doorstep with a note attached to\nthe basket reading\" Eddie's Bastard\".\nThis is the story of that baby; a coming of age novel, but one steeped in family legends, as Billy\nMann discovers his place in the\nworld. The novel may bet set in\nNew England during the 1970's and 8 0 ' s, but Mann ville is so small town\" and the Mann house\ndike a southern states plantation\nMansion transplanted to the north) is so isolated, the en v iron m ent of Billy's upbringing is hardly\nAfferent to that of his grand fa ther. With Thomas increasingly\naddicted to Bushmills, Billy has to\n'a\" back on his own resources to\nde al with the harsh realities of life,\nSu ch as a Neanderthal school bully\nmi: ar)d the\n'he hou.\nmonstrous neighbour in\nse on the hill, Mr Simpson.\n' ls not however an entirely brutal\nworld. Despite his inadequacies it\nclear that Thomas really loves his\ngrandson, and other members of\nthe Mannville community such as\nMr and Mrs Gruber the grocers\nand Dr Connor, keep a watchful\neye. There is also the most welcoming woman in the town Elsie\nOrfenbacher, who in exchange for\nfree groceries takes Billy through\nthe initiations of adolescent sex.\nBilly has other companions in\nthe ghosts of his ancestors who\nmaintain a real presence in the\nfamily home. As Billy makes sense\nof his life he also has to become\nreconciled with the misdeeds of\nsix generations of Manns, as he is\nquite literally haunted by the sins\nof his forefathers. This is not a dark tale however. Throughout\nthere is a strong vein of (some-times black) humour and the narrative is imbued with Billy's optimism. This is a fine first novel from\nKowalski, which combines a compelling narrative with an assured\nevocation of place, peopled with\ncharacters both humane and grotesque. He maintains Billy's perspective from childhood through adolescence in an entirely\nconvincing manner, explaining\nsome\nmysteries but leaving others\nunresolved( perhaps for a sequel?).

Her putative African lover and traveling companion, a doctor with one\nof the aid agencies, has vanished\nfrom the scene of the crime. Tess a's much older husband, Justin, a career diplomat at the\nBritish High Commission in\nNairobi, sets out on a personal\nodyssey in pursuit of the killers\nand their motive. What he might\nknow and what he ultimately learns make him suspect among\nhis own colleagues and a target\nfor the profiteers who killed his\nwife.\nA master chronicler of the deceptions and betrayals of\nordinary people caught in political\nconflict, le Carre portrays, in The\nConstant Gardener, the dark side\nof unbridled capitalism. His eighteenth novel is also the profoundly\nmoving story of a man whom tragedy elevates. Justin Quayle,\namateur gardener and ineffectual\nbureaucrat, seemingly oblivious to\nhis wife's cause, discovers his own\nresources and the extraordinary\ncourage of the woman he barely\nhad time to love.\nThe Constant Gardener is a magnificent exploration of the\nnew world order by one of the most compelling and elegant sto-John11 C CONST/ f.

    "content": "NEi^ yr T0 Knee jerk reaction to net KNOW\nadoptions? MARIAM GHORBANNEJAD\nTwins Belinda and Kimberly lay blissfully\nunaware of the media frenzy surrounding them\nwhen they were snatched by Flintshire social\nservices on the night of Thursday18 th of\nJanuary. Since their arrival in Britain, they have\nassumed celebrity status. Judith and Alan Kilshaw, the couple who adopted the girls for\n\u00a38,200 over the internet, have been threatened\nwith legal action from an American couple, Vickie\nand Richard Allen. This couple claim they had\nalready bought the twins for \u00a34,000 from Tina\nJohnson, the head of the adoption brokers the\n'Caring Heart Agency'. To add to this bizarre set\nof events, the childrens' natural mother, Tranda\nWecker, now also says she wants them back.\n'Fury' was Prime Minister Tony\nBlair's reaction. Jack Straw, Home Secretary, was also known\nto have been equally disgusted.\nPublic opinion is one of revulsion.\nScandals such as this recent one\nseem to have a much greater\naffect on the Government than\nany pressure group could hope to\nhave. The White Paper on adoption that was published in\nDecember was not due to be\nbrought in until January of next\nyear. However, the process has\nbeen accelerated and is now due\nto be brought in this April. The\nGovernment have proposed to tighten laws on\nadopting from abroad, eager to be seen acting\nswiftly in the wake of the Kilshaw fiasco.\nCurrently, the 1976 Adoption Act is in place.\nThis act makes it an offence for any advertisement to be published indicating that a parent or\nguardian want their child to be adopted, or that a person wants to adopt a child, or that any person\nother than the local social services authority or\nvoluntary adoption agency approved by the secretary of state is willing to make arrangements\nfor the adoption of a child.\nNew Labour, like the previous Conservative\nGovernment, have been slow in reforming adoption laws. The Adoption ( International Aspects )\nAct 1999 has been passed although it has not\nyet been activated. This will ensure protection\nfor children adopted from overseas. It will introduce sanctions against people attempting to\nadopt children before assessment, including a \u00a3600 fine and three months in prison. However\nthis will still not apply to adoptions from America, meaning it will be possible for domestic\nadoption tests to be by-passed by would-be\nadopters in this country. Presently, anybody\nwishing to adopt a child in this country has to\nundergo extensive testing lasting up to six\nmonths. Social services have to carry out\nassessment of suitability and medical and police\nreferences have to be obtained.\nAdoption websites are to be cracked down on.\nHealth Minister, John Hutton, plans more regulation of the internet. He has said that\ninternet providers will be prosecuted for\n/ice\ndeal the The so-called \"net twins\", left, and right, Judith Kilshaw\nrelaying information that breaks British adoption\nrules. Enforcing this rule could cause problems,\ndue to the vast quantities of information which is\naccessible via the internet. Internet Service\nProviders (ISPs) are not licenced and are not\nobligated to register anywhere. Their three main\nfunctions are to provide access to the web, 'host-ed web space' and bulletin boards where articles\ncan be posted. Therefore, it would be feasible for\nthe ISPs to ban a website. But fears are that this\ncould give a site notoriety, prompting many more\npeople to look at it. The law would only be applicable to British - based sites, so the Government\nwould have no power to shut down any foreign\nbased sites. The sheer scale of the internet\nmakes the task of monitoring all information\nfound on 'hosted web space' and bulletin boards\nimpractical, argues the Internet Service\nProviders Association. A code of practice to\nwith illegal material is already being followed the\n130 internet firms who are members of the association. David Kerr, chief executive of another group, the\nInternet Watch Foundation (IWF), said ' I think\nit's been generally accepted by ministers and the11 police that the internet service providers don't and can't be expected to know what's on their\nservers.' He continued that the industry had tried\nto stop material appearing on the web which j would be illegal to publish in other forms in thi\nUK. What remains unclear is what status ISPs\nhave, since some people say that they are just,\nIconduits for\ninformation\nrather than\npublishers,\nand should\ntherefore no l be account\nable for any\nillegal material found onI\nthem. ' 1\nEuropean l directive which will |\nbecome law\nwithin the\nnext two\nyears agrees. But the Department of Health's proposals contradict this.\nEvidently, in the Government's haste to bring in\nreforms to our adoption laws, they have failed to\nproperly think through the new legislation. A prison sentence seems a bit harsh while a fine of\n\u00a3 6 0 0 is almost pointless, given the huge\namounts of money people are willing to part with\nto adopt a child in the first instance. Greater regulation of the internet, although important, will\ndo nothing to stop anyone hoping to adopt a child in the future. The Department of Health did\nnot consult the industry before rushing to their\nown conclusions, meaning we will have laws\nwhich are impossible to enforce and so be no\nfurther forward in stopping the sale of children\non the internet.\n\u2022m News \u2022 29th January 2001 \u2022 Felix \u2022\n\u2014 * \u2022 \u2022, it "

For\nhere I espied the screaming headline 'Feminist cult around artist\n\"has no basis.'\"\nThis headline alluded to a painting\n(Judith Beheading Holoformes, ca.\n1611) in the latest exhibition at the\nRoyal Academy (RA) and to its creator, Artemesia Gentileschi (1593-1652/3). Judith is often interpreted\nas Artemesia's response to being\nraped by her tutor Agastino Tassi.\nSuch an interpretation is understandable - the picture is a shocking depiction of two women cutting\nthe head off a man.\nNow, Artemesia has been the subject of many an academic paper\nand even a recent bestseller( Artemisia: A Novel by Alexandra\nLapierre); but apparently, much of\nthis is baloney, for it is revealed by\nthe RA curator (Beverley Louise\nBrown) that the painting is not\nactually informed by the experience\nof being raped - but by observations of public executions (and the\nwork of Caravaggio, 1571-1610). It\nis not explained how Ms Brown\n0*\nW \u2022 i IP* arrived at this conclusion (from\nArtemesia, via the spirit world?).\nThis controversy is more than I can\nstomach of a morning. So what\ncan be going on? Cynics might\nargue that this is merely a shameful attempt by the RA to drum up\nphoney controversy for publicity\npurposes. And what a waste of\ngood PR girls and boys - the exhibition is great anyway, with works\nby all the usual suspects( van\nDyck; Rubens; Brueghel - not the\nBrueghel, but his son).\nThe Cardsharps (Caravaggio, ca.\n1595 - pictured) is a fabulous portrayal of two old scamps taking\nadvantage of a slightly credulous\n(but, from the facial expression,\nslightly suspicious) young man. It is\neasy to see how this painting started Caravaggio' s career when it\ncaught the eye of Cardinal Francesco Maria del Monte, the art\ncollector (and little-known inventor\nof canned pineapple). This exhibition is absolutely superb and what's more, it is a marked improvement\non the guff (e.g. Turner: The Great\nWatercolours) that the RA has\nbeen churning out of late.\nWill\nNearest tube* Green Park If fashion is your passion, then\nI head over the road to the V&/\\ The Canon gallery is hosting an\nexhibition called Imperfect Beauty\nThe Making of Contemporary\nFashion Photographs, that spills,\nthe beans on how those iD and\nThe Face fashion shoots are con-struct ed. The world's top image i makers have allowed their sketch\npads, Polaroid' s and re pro's to\npasted together into exhibits so\nthat we can have an insight into\nhow they work.\nYou might think this is of no inter-est, but remember that the product of these shoots has great\npower in our culture; witness the\nblame placed on fashion industry\nfor teenage bulimia, for instance.\nSo I was somewhat humbled to\nconclude that the success of the ii final images comes from a good\nidea, sheer hard work and a dose\nof good fortune; not from any corporate manifesto or vast manipulation by computer.

The biochemistry department was kindly represented by Dr. David\nLeek. The government of Rwanda was not\nonly represented by it's ambassador to\nLondon, but also by the headmaster of the\nschool in Kigali where Charlotte taught and\nmade such an impact in teaching science in\nan inspired and enthusiastic way. Her loss\nwill be deeply felt by all her pupils at the\nschool.\nThe moving service for Charlotte at St Alban,\nwas led by the Venerable Howard Levvett.\nMusic chosen by her family (her mother Margot, and younger brother and sister, Richard and Catherine) and the church included pieces from Faure's Requiem which\nwas beautifully sung by the Anton Bruckner\nChoir with church organist accompaniment.\nThe Imperial College choir in which Charlotte\nwas a soprano sang Henry Purcell's \"Music\nfor Queen Mary's Funeral\" - again beautifully sang in the lovely acoustic of St Alban church. The whole congregation joined in a number of hymns including a poignant \"Abide with me\".\nThis was a fitting memorial to Charlotte, attended by over 300 people.

However,\nthe republican entourage and their mindless\nleader were in for a shock when they went to\nuse their computers.

Seriously annoyed by the prank played on\nthem by their democratic adversaries, the\nconservatives were forced to crawl around\nunder their chairs in search of the missing\nkeys. In some cases the W's were stuck\nbelow desks, in others they were taped to\nmoving ceiling fans and air conditioning vents.

It's election time you see, and time to decide very soon,\nyou're tempted, here's what you'd be letting yourself in for...\nSo you fancy running a \u00a33.5 million annual\nturnover organisation with 30 full-time and 200\npart time staff, six sites, two hundred clubs,\nthree deputies and around 1,000 elected student officers?\nWell some of your more formal responsibilities\nare below, with some advice about each of\nthem:\n* Uphold the policy and further the aims and\nobjects of the Union - at the end of the day it is\nyour job to see that Council's wish (that is, what\nthe students want) is done. You will also need\nto be familiar with a great deal of regulations\nand policies, as people will come to you for\nadvice about them and others may take you to\ntask if you break them.\n* Be the ultimate representative of the Unionyou represent people on College's governing\nbodies, both academic and managerial, and\nneed to perform\nwell in front of experienced senior admin is tra tors, academics or governors, who've seen plenty of 'your type' before. You will also have to\nspeak to the press (don't shoot your mouth off)\nand often represent Imperial to the wider world.\n* Be responsible for the efficient organisation\nof the Union - if there are problems in any part\nof the organisation, people aren't getting along\nor things need to get done, you need to sort it\nout. Tact, integrity and maturity are good\nvirtues here.\n* Be ultimately responsible for the finances of\nthe Union. If the Deputy President (Finance &\nServices), or the Union's finance department\ngoofs up, it's your fault. You don't have to be a budding accountant, just be sensible and stay\non the alert.\nDon't be put off by all of that though. Anyone\nclever enough to get into Imperial can learn a lot on the job, and no-one expects you to be\nperfect. Humility and a sense of humour and an\nability to get on with people are useful additions\nif you want to make the year a pleasant one. It\ncan form a solid start to any career, but don't do\nit just for CV points, as you will need a commitment and an ability to give a damn about students to get through the long winter nights.\nThe good points are - more experience of more\nuseful skills than anything else imaginable, you'll\nmake new friends and many ex-sabbaticals I have met remember much they enjoyed about\ntheir sabbatical year, even if it was twenty\nyears ago. You are your own boss (to an extent\n- remember that whole democracy thing), and\nyou enjoy more responsibility than many graduates have after years building up their career.\nSo, not afraid to make difficult decisions?\nBe unpopular? Sit on lots of meetings? Deal with lots of bits of paper? Say \"no\"\nquite a lot? This could be the job for you!\nSeriously though, D P(F&S) is effectively\nthe bank manager of the Union, balancing\nmoney in against money out, chairing a number of committees based around finance and services, and attending a lot of\nmeetings around College. You' ll have to\nuse huge amounts of tact and professionalism to know when a club is going to cause\nfinancial trouble, and make sure it doesn't happen.\nThese are your main areas of responsibility:\nThe^ DP( C&SX s na^ overseeing the running and management of\nall ICU clubs and societies. He/ She will\nalso be responsible for ensuring that the\nC CU clubs and societies run in accordance\nwith ICU policy, Imperial College policy and\nthe law. You are also responsible for ensuring that the ICU health and safety policy is\nadhered too and that all aspects of ICU run\nas safely as is practicable.\n*College Committees\nThe DP(C& S) is responsible for representing recreational student activities to\nCollege. This requires that the DP(C& S) sit\na number of committees, each of which\nmeet at least once a term and are the\nappropriate place to voice concerns regarding the various areas of sporting activity.\n* Budgets\nYour biggest task over the year is to balance the budget. This means getting as\nmuch money as you can out of College and\ndividing it fairly between societies, salaries\nand subsidies.\n\"College Committees\nYou have to attend a huge number of\nCollege meetings, ranging from the very\nimportant (a few) to the very dull (very\nmany). On very many issues you and the\nPresident will be representing the students-these are mostly College working groups,\nand will take up a lot of your time.\n\"Union meetings\nYou' ll be chairing Union Finance Committee, House Committee( this deals\nwith maintaining all Union premises) and\nTrading, Services and Retail Committees,\nwhich deal with bars, catering, ents, advice\nand the Union Shops- you'll definitely find\nyou have a finger in every pie.\n\"Training and advice\nTo ensure clubs run their finances properly\nit's up to you to train up the treasurers- and\nto be on hand when they need help. Like it\nor not, your office is the first one along, and\nwhen people come in to ask a question,\nthey're almost certain to remember what\nyou say, so you'll have to make sure it's right.\n^ J in ion Go^^ Within the Union you are an ex officio member of all committees and it is quite\nworth popping in to various meetings from\ntime to time just to get your face seen even\nif nothing else, especially at the beginning\nof the year. As a sabbatical the DP(C& S) has a duty to ensure that levels of student\nrepresentation are maintained on all committees this means that the DP(C& S) will\noften find him/ herself attending commit-tee's such as Trading, Services, Retail etc...\nThese committees are essential to the democracy of the Union and you must\nattend wherever possible.\n\"Freshers Fair\nProbably the single biggest task that the\nDP(C& S) will face is the organisation of\nif\nFresher sr air about 200 companies are contacted and\nleaflets are sent to them detailing the price\nof stalls and the date/ times of the fair\netc... The companies will then mail back\nbooking orders. The DP(C& S) will lias e with the conference office to make sure\nthat the rooms are available (and booked)\nfor the fair.\n\" Day to Day\nMost of the DP( C&S)'s time is spent in day\nto day problem solving and information dissemination tasks.

First on the agenda, I have managed to kill the evil\ndemon guarding the Felix prize vault in order to bring you a \u00a310 book token,\nunfortunately and unavoidably slightly stained with demon guts, should you\nmanage to complete the crossword using the cryptic clues above.\nIf you want to win the token, submit your completed grid to the Felix office\nbefore 3pm on Wednesday for a chance to win the token. In case you don't know, and there is no reason why you should, we Felix types exist in the top por-ta cabin between Physics and the liquid Nitrogen tank. Although this means that\nthere is the facility to suffocate most of the Felix staff at once, it also provides\nus with highly effective air conditioning when that London summer heat hits.\nWhy precisely the bottom porta cabin remains generally unoccupied is a matter\nof some speculation, though I personally suspect that Turnip Henry has locked\naway a particularly nasty crossword to be unleashed upon you as his final act of\nrevenge. Of course, it could be merely because the editor has a stair fetish.\nThis brings me decreasing ly neatly to the second of my tidings of joy. If you\nprefer a quickie as opposed to all that long, laborious exe rsi on that some people go in for, you may enjoy the alternative quick crossword. By a feat of spatial agility which shall remain unequalled until Russia successfully lands the\ndefunct Mir space station on Carol Vorderman, the answers to the quick clues\non the left will fit in the grid also used by their cryptic counterparts. Thus, I have\nsaved countless life-giving and eminently hug gable trees, but more importantly\nmy own time so I can watch Countdown, which I hear is soon to require a new\nnumber-cruncher.\nUntil next week, don't have nightmares - we can get consonants from any-where.

Foil was first, and\nalthough there was a great deal of level pegging to start with,\nabout half way through Imperial secured a lead that they were\nnot to loose. Everyone performed well, and the final score reflected this - a secure win of 45 v27. The e pee didn't prove to be quite so easy, with Surrey rarely\nmore than 5 hits behind, and sometimes taking the lead. The\nstate of our team didn't help, with Clare providing entertainment\nby having to borrow kit off of Surrey, and then trying to fence\nwith a left-handed weapon (not advisable for the only right-hand-ed member of the team!). Still, we managed to (just about) keep\nour heads, with the Kaptain fencing the final bout, taking the\nscore to 45 v40 for Imperial.\nLet's hope for the same result this t week, when the women\nare fencing Reading and the men are matched against Royal\nHolloway. If anyone is interested in watching the matches, both\nare being fenced in dB's in the Union this Wednesday (31st January), between 2:30 and 5pm. Feel free to come along and\nshow your support. If you would like to try fencing for yourself,\nplease come along to the Union Gym on a Tuesday or Friday\n\u2022 lunchtime.\n\u00a3\ni Walking in a winter DiscDoctors Land\ni It was a bloody cold Saturday morning, and we the\nI insane/brave/least hung over of DiscDoctors ventured forth to\nj Cockfosters (which was doing a fine impersonation of Siberia) to\n1 play Ultimate against Blue-on-Blue (BoB).\n' We used the first several points to practise our Zone and\nJunk defence but due to the conditions they were not that e ffe cIti ve. Also the hard ground (which supposedly was soil, but was\nI more like soft concrete) resulted in Big Gay injuring his ankle and\nI so we lost the benefit of his handling ability. However, \"The\n\u2022 Claw's\" knee injury had got better by this match and thus the\nteam was not left lacking in talent\nWe soon switched to man on man defence and constantly\n- forced BoB to throw backhand, punishing them for their dependence on sidearm throws. This defence was successful and with\ngood interplay between S BG, The Package, Rob and the rest of\nj the team we slowly cruised to our initial aim of taking the first\nhalf. The first point of the second half saw BoB scoring. This was\nbecause \"Macdonalds employee\" the Package, mack ed the disc\nhigh in the air in our end-zone, gifting BoB with an easy catch to\nscore.\nJimmy, Fukwit and Diva demonstrated to the opposition the\nidea of break-away cuts to the end-zone, with well placed huck s, resulted in our score notably mounting.\nWith continued good play, and some nice first and second\ncuts from TC and Scot, we eventually beat BoB 17-11.\n\u2022Felix \u2022 29th January 2001 \u2022 Sport/Horoscopes\n\n"

    "content": "screen The Claim\nDirector: Michael Winter bottom Starring: Peter Mullan, Milla Jovovich, Nast as s jaK in ski Ba sed partly on Thomas Hardy's19 th century novel\nThe Mayor of Caster bridge, the\nClaim is an epic story of greed,\nlove and betrayal set against the\nbackdrop of the American gold\nrush of the 1800's. In other words,\nit's a Western with snow.\nMullan plays Dillon, an Irish immigrant who has struck gold and\nmade a fortune - he practically\nowns the entire, isolated town of\nKingdom Come, situated high up\nin the Sierra Nevada mountains.\nHis mistress is the local madam\n(Jovovich) and everything seems\nto going swimming ly until the chief\nrailroad engineer arrives in town\nalong with an impoverished and\ndying Elena( Kin ski) and her daughter. The engineers decision\non where the railroad should be\nlaid could make or break the town,\nand Elena and her daughter carry\na dark secret from Dillon's past.\nThe direction by Winterbottom is\nimpressive. The film really manages to capture the excitement,\nthe hardships, and the adventure\nof the early Californian gold rush.\nAlso carrying the film along are\nsome great performances - in par-ti cula r, Mullan's portrayal of the\nguilt stricken town plutocrat and\nJovovich' s resourceful brothel owner stand out.\nThe film can be slow at time. Indeed, the first hour, if you were\ncruel, could be considered plain\nboring. However, the film redeems\nitself with an excellent second half.\nWinterbottom has gone to great\nlengths to make the western feel\nin The Claim as haunting and sparse as possible. The period\ndetail and snow-swept mountain\nlandscapes, are also stunning.\nThere isn'ta great amount of\naction in the film, nor are there any\nshocking plot twists but the film\ndoesn't need them. The central\nstory is strong enough and the\ncharacters are varied and realistic.\nDon't go and see The Claim if\nyou're in the mood for excitement\nor action. If you have tie for an\nintelligent and slightly different\nmovie experience, it could well be\nworth a couple of hours of your\ntime.\nThe Claim is in cinemas now.\nBeautiful Creatures\nDirector: Bill Eagles Starring: Rachel Weisz, Susan Lynch and Alex Norton Beautiful creatures is a film\nabout two women who are\nunited when they accidentally kill\none of their abusive boyfriends. It\nhas been touted as Thelma& Louise north of the border (the film\nis set in Glasgow) - not an inaccurate description, except it really\nisn't as good as Ridley Scott's film.\nDorothy( Lynch) and Pe tula( Weisz) decide to try to con a ran-som out of Pet ul a's deceased boyfriend's gangster brother. Of\ncourse, all does not go to plan. The\nvisual style of the movie is a bit of\na mess, veering wildly between\npre-war industrial looks and wood\npanelled nautical style interiors. It\nall has a sort of made for BBC drama look to it. The acting, for\nthe most part, is pretty poor, although Lynch and Weisz are not\ntoo bad.\nBill Eagles says he likes his films\nto be \"Dark, Funny, and shocking\".\nWell, one out of three isn't bad.\nMake that two if you like contrived\none-liners and lock stock style cheesy slapstick humour. The main\nproblem, however, is that the film\nreally isn't that shocking. The plot\ntwists and turns it's way to an all\ntoo predictable ending, and apart\nfrom one moment where a man\nhits his head so hard that blood\ncomes out from behind his eyes,\nnothing really stands out.\nLike Thelma and Louise, there is a good degree of chemistry between\nthe two female leads( in fact,]\nthere'sa scene where I really!\nhoped it was going to boil over,\nbut it wasn't to be) but unfortunately, it's not enough to carry the\nfilm. In fact the two actresses\nstruck up a good friendship on the\nset, which gives their on screen\nrelationship an extra dimension.\nThe directing really isn't anything\nto shout about, and the script is, to |\nbe blunt, painful. The humorous\nbits are few and far between. All\ntoo often the jokes are simply too\npredictable. Don't waste your time\nwith this film - if you want to see a decent female crime flick, get bound on video (where - hey! - tl>e girls actually get it on), and pray\nthat the arts council stops funding\nunremarkable Brit crime movies.\nBeautiful Creatures is out now.\nI Tom a Screen \u2022 29th January 2001 \u2022 Felix \u2022\n\n"

Feli\ncarried out the traditional mid-term interviews.\n\"It has certainly\nbeen very interest-ing, an experience\nlike no other\"\n\"You need to be\nable to take lots of\ndifficult decisions\nand justify them.\"\nYou've been President for six months\nnow, has it been what you expected?\nMostly yes, I mean there's always\nareas that are not quite expected,\nbut I think the amount I 've worked is\na lot more than I'd expected or had\nhoped, but I think some of that\nworked I 've created for myself, It has\ncertainly been very interesting, an\nexperience unlike any other.\nWhat have been your main challenges this year?\nKeeping on good terms with the\nCollege is always a good challenge,\nalthough a difficult challenge,\nbecause you have two competing\nproblems; one you have to represent\nthe students, which might or might\nYou've been D P(F&S) for 6 months\nnow, has the job been all you expected?\nIn some ways it's been all I expect-ed, in other ways it's been very diff e rent from what I expected. Overall, it's been as good, if not\n=tter.\nWhat have you enjoyed most about\nit?\nI think the thing I 've enjoyed most\nhas been working with the staff and\nthe other sabbaticals, to be perfectly honest I couldn't hope for a nicer more talented committed and\ndedicated bunch of people\nnot be in agreement with the\nCollege, secondly, you should get on\nwith them to make sure that they're\nmore receptive to your views. Some\nof my work in the structural review of\nthe Union has been quite hard, in\nthat a lot of people have very difficult\nviews, and getting them to agree on\nanything is quite a difficult challenge.\nWhat would you say were the qualities that make a good President?\nPatience and tact are two very useful\nvirtues, the ability to stand on your\nfeet, the ability to believe in yourself,\ngood advocacy skills, so that if you\nare trying to present something to a group of very distinguished people or\nwhatever, the ability to persuade\nWhat have been the main challenges that have faced you?\nWell, coming from what one would\ncall a non-union hack position I had\nto spend quite a lot of time getting\nup to speed on how the whole thing\nworks, but I think that's given me\nan advantage in as much that I don't have any preconceptions and I can approach the whole question of\nwhat we spend our money on and\nwhy with perhaps a fresher mind.\nThe main challenges internally have\nbeen the continuing closure of Beit\nHall, which has had an effect on our\ntrading profits which has been a shame, but we are confident that\nnext year that will improve. We're'\nthem as to your line of the argument.\nYou've got to be able to get on with\npeople. A sense of humour, essential,\nif you can't laugh at yourself then\ndon't do this job, because you'll need\nsome. Essentially there's no one\noverriding skill, it's a whole set of different ones. I would also add that a lot of people grow into the job, you\nmight not think you have all of those\nskills, but you'll be surprised what\nyou're capable of when you're in this\nsituation.\nWhat would be your advice for someone considering standing?\nDon't be deterred by everything I 've\njust said, the job is very interesting\neven if it's very hard work\nalso going through something of a staff transition at the moment, and\nthat's been quite interesting to han-dle. And budgets, naturally, budgets are always a challenge.\nSo what are the qualities that make\na good d pfs? Inquisitiveness, the primary characteristic of ad pfs is to ask searching\nquestions and to carry on asking\nthem until you actually have the full\npicture. You need to have a good\nhead for numbers, obviously, and\nyou need to be able to take difficult\ndecisions and justify them to very\nexperienced people in all sorts of\ndifferent fields.\n\"My main challenges have been\nto not get pissed\noff with people.\"\nHas the job been all you expect-ed?\nIt's been a little harder than I expected, I 've done quite a lot\nmore work than I was expecting to\ndo, but it's been fun.\nAnd what were your other big aims\nfor the year?\nI didn't really have many major\naims, because now clubs and societies run pretty well at Imperial,\nI'm just trying to build on what\neveryone else has done, make things easier, make our clubs more\nsuccessful than they are already.\nWhat have been your main challenges during this year?\nMy main challenges have been not\nto get pissed off with people, I think I 've managed it so far, and I think I 've managed not to piss that\nmany people off, which was one of\nmy big aims for the year.\nWhat have been the worst things\nthat have happened what have\nbeen your main failings?\nI haven't had major failures. The\ndocumentation policy is quite a difficult one, it's been quite hard to\nimplement and it's been a struggle\nto make sure that everything is up\nto date so that clubs aren't getting\npenal is ed when they have handed\nthings in. But that's not been a massive failure, it's just that it's been one of the hardest things I 've\ndone and I think it could have been\ndone better.\nWhat qualities would you say\nmake a good DP(C& S)? You have to be friendly, you have\nto be quite organised, but most of\nall I think friendly is the best one\nbecause people come and talk to\nyou all day, and you have to be\ngood with people.\nWhat do you think will be the main\nchallenges for your su qc ess or? To do better than I have done.\nFeature 29th January 2001 \u2022 Felix\n\n"

To be fair\nwith the freezing weather it was\nlike playing on a bumpy astroturf\npitch, which therefore meant that\nthe game was scrappy and hard.\nHowever, the IC boys man gaged to create so em chances early on, a slick move down the right led to\nBunny hitting the post, and it was\ngenerally promising.\nGl Joules got injured, and then\nrang himself an ambulance, well\ndone Gl, sorry about the foot. Two\nballs managed to go over the\nfence, into a garden. One was an\nimpressive effort from George, a beautifully skied shot. Otherwise\nthe goal came after about 75 mins,\nwhen Tony broke down the left,\n'crossed' the ball to Bunny at the\nfar post, who slotted it past their\nappeals for offside. This wound\nthem up slightly and they lost the\nplot. Giving the ball away frequently, Fumex and Robbie both\nhad chances to make it two but\nneither could finish the excellent\nchances they created. The only\nother notable event was the comeback of the captain of our ship\n'fast' who after a three month layoff still managed to take some-body s legs away just outside the\nbox, giving the spectators a heart\nattack. Other notable performances included the Giant, who had a superb game. AN G as skipper,\nand Alan Cowley( from the half\nway line). Next up RUMS and\nthen G KT in the semis of the cup.\nMOT M: Malcom Dunkley\nSport\nTEAM: Morley, Sen ner, Dunkley, Gilmore (capt), Cowley,\nGait e,P or rec a( sub Pratt 40),\nSaslis-Lagoudakis (sub : Millman\n85), Fumex, Boyce, Bunnet.\n- John Don\nIC 2nds52 Kings 2nds A double header? League and\ncup? Captain injured? Pressure on? No worry's lads!\nKings were bad, very bad! We were all over them to begin with.\nThey held out for a bit but just\nwhen you thought the worm may\nhave turned, up pops Boyce eee with a cross-cum-shot that curls\nin. Next up we have your sports\neditor latching on to a through ball\non the left and driving in a shot\nfrom the edge of the area. Sorted.\nAnother, effort from TB from\nthe wing put us 3 - 0 up then\nRitchie Pratt (the captain of our\nship) made a break through the\nmiddle. A well placed pass to lain\nand, one turn and shot later, we\nwere 4 - 0 up.\nHalf time team talk? All well?\nNot a chance! We need to work to\nkeep it!\nSubstitutions necessary, but it\nall went awry! They came back,\ntwo goals that should never have\nbeen (of course). Magic (three in\nthree) got our fifth, in off the far\npost (was it a cross??? Of course\nnot!!!). Subsequent chances were\ncreated, but no, they were not to\nbe. Rash Kings (f**k 'em) chall en ges came in. JP( not many\nsaves today) got an unnecessary\nboot in the face and lain was lucky\nnot to be crippled by a two footed\nlunge. The dirty bunch of ***ts.\nStill, we won by a mile.\nThe Tossers!\n- lain\nSOP II 1 - 10IC VII An amazing result for the sevenths with only our second victory\nof the season but a great boost to\nteam confidence. As the score line suggests we totally dominated this\ngame except for a brief lapse when they scored whilst we were\nalready 10 - 0 up.\nWe were 6 - 0 ahead at half\ntime after Gopal had opened the\nscoring about 5 minutes in with a clean strike from 10 yards. Sugi\nscored his first of 4 soon after\nbefore Andy Smith slotted home a penalty for his first IC goal. A skillful direct run down the right\nled to Gurdish's first goal and Sugi\nand Matt grabbed another one\neach before the break.\nWe had been forced to play 35\nminute halves on a tiny pitch after\nSOP turned up an hour late and\nour original pitch had been stolen\nby their firsts. Despite the short-e ned. halves we slotted home 4\nmore goals in the second half,\nincluding a stunner from Matt Cromwell: a volley on the turn\nfrom the edge of the box. Gurdish\nscored after another storming run\ndown the left this time and Sugi\nput away 2 more chances and Ed\nwas very unlucky not to score after am azy run through SOP's so\ncalled defence.\nNow that we know what it\nfeels like to be on the other end of\na thrashing we plan to experience\nit more often.\n- AOS\nDrinking\nA pint downing knock-out\ncompetition? How childish! I don'l think.\nEarly rounds, like all the rest\nwere free from illegal gambling\nEarly on: Magic and 8th seed Tin\nhad to have a second pint bef on Tim went through, lain was the\nfirst seed to go out against, th j surprise package, Gary Robinson.\nMany further pints were drunk\nOne by one the seeds fell. Tim dis\nplayed a shocking disregard fo\nclothes and stripped. Paul Davie:\nwent out earlier than expected\nsoon followed by Bola Bola am\nPsycho Soberg. Don't ask me wh(\nbeat who. I'm trashed!\nYanks looked on agog, as we l they might! Songs were sung but\nthat's just what songs tend to do.\nSo then, there was a final\nMark \"Spillage\" Dawkins had produced the Bola Bola Tankard but\nwhose name would be etched ont<\nit for time immemorial???\nIt was between \"Even;\nfavorite\" John Don and the s turd j challenger Chris Cullen.

Some committees have\nthe Deputy President D P(E&W) as a named\nmember in the Constitution or the Chairs will\napproach the D P(E&W) directly at the beginning of the academic year.

Which is good, because\nin theory no-one can tell you what to do.\nIn practice, there's three major limits to this.\nFirstly, you have to pay for it. Secondly, Felix\nstill costs the Union quite a bit, and they have a perfect right to know where their money's going. Thirdly, if you go round upsetting every-one, you'll have very few stories, and very little\nsupport the next time you get yourself into trou-ble.\nSo what does a Felix Editor do (apart from the\nobvious)?\n\"Union Handbook\nTogether with your predecessor/successor, you\nhave to put a very important 180 page book\ntogether.

These provide\nlines of communication through which comments and idea as well as problems and help\ncan flow in both directions.\nBeing a member of both ICU Council and the\nExecutive Committee provides the channels of\ncommunication and an opportunity for account-ability. Sitting on the Union Finance Committee\nprovides a means of input on the Union's finances and exercises the financial responsibility bestowed on the Deputy President( Education & Welfare) in the CU Financial\nRegulations. Being ex-officio on all Union\nCommittees and sub-committees provides for\ninput on all matters relating to ICU. This\namount of it, but you still have to make sure it's all ok, and get some adverts.\n\"Advertising\nAlthough you get some money from the Union,\nnext year's Editor will still have to raise a minimum of \u00a320,000 by getting adverts, any way\nyou can. No adverts, no Felix, no job....\n\"Management\nUnique role this one- you're the only manager\nwho sees a process right through, you'll even do\ndelivery and cleaning.

If no\nsatisfactory reply is received, contact ICU Exec via the Union President\nMEDICINE FAIL TO SORT IT\nOUT Dear Felix\nSeeing as so many are currently\ncomplaining about their courses,\nI may as well add my ten cents.\nHow would you like not to have a personal tutor? For those stu dents of the old Charing Cross and Mary's first year clinical medical courses this is a reality.\nDespite complaining, asking and\nscreaming they still haven't been\nallocated, despite promises of\nthem being here after the Xmas holidays, which is late enough as\nit is! I presume the case is similar\nwith the new course students not\nbeing allocated their clinical personal tutors for those who started their firm rotations in January.\nExams are close, any chance of\ngetting some support before then? Also, I'd like to get to\nknow a person well enough to\ngive me a decent reference. Currently, this isn't possible with\nthe structure of the clinical course as it is, we never see the\nsame people for more than6 weeks in our firms!\nName Supplied\nAs with all anonymous letters we\nget, names are completely confidential no matter what -Ed\nHOPE SO Dear Felix,\nI'd just like to congratulate Felix\nand more specifically Mariam Gh orb anne j ad on her excellent\narticle on 'Iranian prison sentences' in Monday22 nd January's issue. Having grown up\nin England through the 80's and\n90's it was very refreshing to\nread an article on Iran with some\nperspective. Even though it was\nby a fellow Iranian, I hope that\nthe article and the new millennium act as a watershed for better\nreporting of affairs in Iran\nthrough the British media. This\nhopefully will generate better understanding of Iranian affairs\nin this country, which hopefully\nshould be beneficial for both\ncountries.\nFatemeh Beyad\nI KNOW I BELIEVE IN NOTHING BUT IT IS MY NOTHING Dear John,\nI imagine you are overwhelmed\nafter last week's 'interesting' contributions on the letter's page,\nbut then I remember that I am\nprobably the only reader (must\nbe because I'm a chemist, too\nmuch lab time you see).\nI'm basically going to raise a point I noticed ages ago, but is of\nparticular relevance after the last\nissue's concentration on de pre s sion. AmI the only person who's noticing your subtle references\nto The Holy Bible throughout the\nyea? No,I don't mean the\nfavoured work of the world's richest non-profit making organisation (amongst others), but the\nalbum. Not all of the album is\nabout depression though, it's amazing that this album is still\ndeeply relevant to a lot of issues\nsociety faces. I'm surprised you\nhaven't made more of the state\nof affairs in America, especially\nnow that Tipper Gore's further\nremoved from the political scene,\nand the Brady Bill seems to be\nworking. Countless songs can be\napplied to Bush's beliefs and not\njust the obvious song about capital punishment. Political correctness seems to be less of a mains tre am issue now, although cloning laws have re ignited abortion rights arguments. Perhaps\nyou should devote a whole column to the subjects tackled by\nthe album?\nAs for depression, perhaps a more upbeat issue next, concentrate on happy things. Think posit ive, post Christmas blues'' Surely pre Christmas? The commercial concentration of hatred\nthat is Christmas has gone. Days are getting longer, things\nhave stopped dying and flowers\nwill appear soon. Look forward\nto the year ahead.\nYours completely un influenced by\nanything,\nAndrew Jurd\nChem III\nThanks Andrew, glad someone\nnoticed my HI piece of hero wor-ship. For the non disenchanted\nindie kids amongst you, he is\nreferring to the classic album by\nthe Manic Street Preachers. I'm told there was a book of the\nsame name once, too -Ed\nBYE BYE GEOLOGY! Dear Sir,\nIf our new rector really is a 'pas-sion ate believer in the import ance of scientific education'( Felix 1193, p6), then he clearly\ndoesn't regard geology to be a science. I wonder how many other people in senior manage-ment hold this opinion. And shouldn't we all be a little wor-ried?\nSimon J Wright\nMathematics III\nINSERT CURRY PUN HERE\nDear Felix\nAs was reported in News In Brief\nand the letters sections of Felix\ntwo weeks ago, the ICU Curry\npetition has drawn to a successful close. While the \"curry\nextremists\" behind the whole\ndebacle are pleased to have had\nCatering's support and are said\nto have been c huffed to bits that,\nthe curry has been returned to\nthe union, the responsibility for\nthe next stage - i.e. the return of\nthe curry everyday, not just I Wednesday now lies with j, everyone who has ever bought\none to buy them again.\nPeople who visited our site were\nno doubt tempted to sign our online petition by the offer of 384\nbottles of beer to be given to the\ncurry fan with the most witty and\ncompelling reason why the dish\nshould be reinstated. Of the\nmany clever replies we had to\nsift through (removing references\nto roadkill s and the like), we\nfinally decided on a winner KATHERINE LEE, Maths I well\ndone! We will arrange with yon\nto collect your 16 double crates\nof beer from Cobra. Katherine's winning line may be\nfound at www.icu-curries.com for\nthe next few days.\nIn the meantime, we hope you all\nenjoy your forthcoming lunches\nat the Union, and don't let the\ninfamous IC apathy put you off\ndoing anything again - we didn't! All the best\nDan, Martin and Steve\nUNFORTUNATE MISUNDERS TAN DING Dear John,\nAs part of the ICU Council mailing list, I was really disappointed\nto find that Hamish' se mail\nheaded \" Last Council\" referred\nto the previous council, not the\nlast council ever as I had hoped.\nAs ever, Someone\nThe deadline for letters intended for publication is Wednesday 12 noon\n\u2022 drop into the office or email felix@ic.ac.uk.

    "content": "% NEWS Talk to the hand... Pro-life campaigner accuses Lord Winston of \"aggressive\"\nassault\nWILLIAM FOSTER Britain' s foremost exo ert on fertility research\nand one of the world's most respected researchers is facing a police investigation of\nassault following last Monday's crucial vote on\nstem cell research at the House of Lords.\nThe claims centre around a usually low-profile\n.pro-life movement, members of which were{ protesting outside the Lords as peers arrived for\nthe vote. A number of young women, mostly aged\nin their twenties, had set up 101 cardboard sheep\nim Parliment Square while wearing lab coats to\nImark the occasion.\nLord Winston was giving an interview for a television network, believed to be ITN, on the subject\nof the Bill. Ruth Davies, together with \"about\ntwelve friends\" said she was\n\"going in to the Lords\" when! she overheard the Imperial* College researcher answering a question with what shel believed was a lie from her*:\nknowledge of stem cell?* research. She told Felix that\nshe \"calmly, without jumping*\nforward, said 'no it is not\"'. \u201e\nMs Davies claims that. I Lord Winston angrily swung| round and \" looked like he^\nwas going to hit her\", She all edges that the peer then put his hand over her\nmouth and shouted \"Shut up. You keep out of it.\nI'm a scientist\".\nThe 2 4 - year old barrister explained that she knew embryonic stem cells are\" by nature tumours\" and therefore more dangerous than adult\nstem cells, contrary to what had been said in the\ninterview. She added that she had \"picked up quite\na lot of science during the campaign\", despite having had no scientific training. She also claims that\nthe TV crew ignored his actions, pretending not to\nhave seen anything, but several witnesses witnessed the incident.\nRuth Davies added that she had visited Chelsea\nPolice Station in order to make a formal complaint,\nand is currently planning to press charges against\nthe peer, but is \"prepared to accept an apology\".\nFelix was unable to contact Lord Winston for\ncomment, but he is said to deny that the incident\ntook place, Many people have expressed disbelief\nthat the researcher behaved in such a way, and it\nhas been suggested among College circles that the\naccusations are a way or smearing a high-profile\nadvocate of the \"cloning\" research while raising\nthe profile of their own, small group of \"women in\nbobble hats\". A College source said that he\nbelieved the group were \"simply capital ising on an\nex agger at. on\".\nChelsea Police were unable to comment on\nwhether a complaint had been made against any\nparticular individual. Meanwhile, ITN confirmed\nthat they had also heard about the alleged in ci dent, and a spokeswoman added that it was too\nearly to say whether it was one of their camera\ncrews who had been carrying out the interview, but\nsaid that they were \"looking\ninto it\".\nIn a telephone interview\nwith Felix, Miss Davies said\n\"It epi to mises the way the\nwhole cloning debate has been carried out - self important scientists trying to\nsilence the voice of the pub-ic.\"\nShe added \"I was part cu-la rly horrified to be touched\nphysically by Lord Winson.

    "content": "' YOU! m peri al goes into Space\nBOU\nHave you ever thought what it would be like to be in space? Do you find yourself looking into the night sky and wondering: 'what if?' Or are you drawn to\nspace by the challenges it presents to science, technology, and mankind as a whole? Then the SSETI project is for you!\nThe European Space Agency launched the Student Space Exploration &\nTechnology Iniative (SSETI) officially last October with 300 students from\nuniversities all over Europe, when the first steps were taken to build the first\npan-European student satellite. Currently 16 European universities from Pisa\nto Manchester are actively participating in the project, which will eventually\nbe launched on one of ESA's Ariane V rockets. Although this is not the first\nstudent satellite built (TEAMSAT beat us to that), this is the biggest project\nundertaken so far, and certainly the most international.\nEach university takes responsibility of a sub-system, or co-ordinates with\nanother group. They communicate with each other via web cams and IRC\nchats, and there is a huge database in ESA's Dutch offices. Examples of subsystems are Payload, Spacecraft Structure & Configuration, Power,\nPropulsion, Attitude & Orbit Control Systems, Communication Systems, and\nOn-Board Data Handling and there are more.\nUnfortunately, Imperial does not have its own subsystem. But it is not too\nlate to participate in the project. Soon each group will need test their sub-system. This has to be done in a consistent manner, and has to focus on the\nintegration of all the subsystems before assembling the satellite. Our plan is\nto have Imperial act as central student hub to co-ordinate component and\nintegration testing. Eric Trottemant, the Project Coordinator has accepted\nthis proposal, and now we need your support!\nWe are looking for people enthusiastic enough to spare some of their free\ntime to work on the project. We will not have as much engineering input as\nsome of the other groups might enjoy, but we will keep in mind the overall\npicture, and a good overall understanding of micro-satellite development.\nAnd each member will gain an in depth knowledge of the sub-system they\nare assigned to, acting as co-or d in at or to a particular university.\nUndergraduates, Graduates and Academics are all welcome. At first glance\nthis project appears very engineering orientated, but it would be fantastic if\nwe could recruit resources from all disciplines. Mathematicians and\nPhysicians for calculation and communication, Computer Scientists for\nOB DH, Chemists and Chemical engineers to get to grips with the Li battery\nPower supply and the Hydrazine Propulsion system. What about the\nbio/medical students out there, I hear you cry? Well, there's still the possibility of getting an experiment on board, and I'm sure there's somebody out\nthere just dying to make use of a micro-gravity environment!\nSend us an email to s seti_ group@ ic4 life. net. (At last, an ic4 life e mail\naddress! -Ed)\nImperial goes into Space\nNo doubt a few IC students resolved to 'go jogging every day' or 'join\na sports club' on the the first day of this millenium, but how many of\nyou are still going four weeks later? Perhaps you found running bor-ing, and the weather this year hasn't helped... So here's a chance to\ntake part in a competitive but exceptionally fun sporting event with\nyour friends right on IC's door step.\nThe Hyde Park Relays are the largest sporting event organised by an\nICU club with previous events\nattracting over1000 part ici pants, and have taken place every year since1949. The\nrace consists mainly of stu dents, but also includes loc a club teams, ' old boys' teams from various universities and\nalso IC staff teams. There is| also a great European feel to\nthe event with many teams from Holland, Germany,! France, Belgium, etc.\nth Each team consists of either six\nImen or four women, and they\nrun around a4.6 km(3.3 km women) loop around Hyde Park. After the\nrace, a tea is provided in the J CR and prizes are awarded. Aswell as\n;rz es for best team and individual results, there are also awards for\nbest Imperial College teams (men and women) and slowest legs of\nthe day so there is a chance for anyone to win!! This year, Fila have\nhelped us out with over a \u00a31000 prizes as an added incentive to you\nall.\nThe traditional after race party then kicks off in DB's in the evening,\nwhere the Europeans try to out party the British, usually unsuccessfully and we all try to dance with 'post-race legs'.\nIf you would like to take part in\nthis years event, on Saturday17 th February, 2:00pm, you can\nenter at half the normal entry\nj ll j fee if you attend Imperial College, that' s just \u00a31 1 per team for men, and \u00a3 8 for women.\nYou can register or get more\ninfo at www. su.ic.a c.uk/ crosscountry/ h pr or email h pr@ ic.ac.uk\nIf you decide that perhaps a bit\na practise running around the park is required, then come along to\none of the athletics/cross-country clubs training sessions, see website for details.\n\u2022 Felix \u2022 29th January 2001 \u2022 Clubs & Societies\n\n"

Thus the line is crossed from a health interested into an obsession. Eating Disorders Eating disorders affect many people. Anorexia Nervosa sees the individual starving them while Bulimia Nervosa has patterns of binge eating followed by vomiting\nand laxative abuse. Either way the relationship with food is changed and are often due\nto feelings that make the affected person\nunhappy or depressed. It maybe associated with sadness, guilt, loss, fear or anger.\nIt is difficult to say how many people in\nthe UK are affected by an eating disorder.\nMany go undiagnosed but it is believed that\none in every hundred young women are affected by Bulimia and a smaller, but still\nsignificant, number by anorexia. The Royal\nCollege of Psychiatry estimated in 1 9 9 2\nthat at anyone time60,000 individuals were receiving treatment for an Anorexia or\nbulimia. Currently, the Eating Disorder \u2022Association believes the figure to be more\nlikely 90,000, with many more undiagnosed,\nparticularly those with Bulimia\nIt is not only young women affected by\nsuch disorders. Women of all ages are affected, as are men. Approximately 10% of\nthose with eating disorders are men and many report that the disorder began at\nschool, with them being overweight and bullied because of it. Older men also suffer\nperiods of eating disorders at various stages of their life often associate with emotional pressures such as the loss/ illness of partners/ parents, relationship breakdowns, job changes and stresses. Gay men make up about 2 0 % of men with\nan eating disorder, and is such a problem\ndue to the 'body beautiful' image of the gay male community.\nWith all these figures taken into consideration, there are about 1.115 million people in the UK with Anorexia or Bulimia\nAnorexia Nervosa Physical signs can include with severe weight loss, dizziness, constipation, poor\ncirculation (feeling cold) and sleep diff i cul ties. Women also experience the stopping\nof periods, which usually returns once the\nstarving has halted. Often Anorexics will\nexperience osteoporosis( thinning of the bones). Psychologically there is depression,\nmoods wings, intense fear of gaining weight and a distorted perception of body\nweight and shape. Behaviour ally those affected will wear baggy clothes, exercise\nexcessively, lie about eating meals and will\ndeny any problems associated. Bulimia Here physical signs can includes ore throats, repeated mouth infections, dry/ poor skin and sleep difficulties. Periods\ndon't stop, but can be irregular. Due to the\nvomiting, those with Bulimia often have poor teeth and will avoid going to the dent is t. Psychologically those affected feel\ndepressed, and exhibit moods wings and highly emotional behaviour. Behaviour ally they will eat large amounts of food followed\nby vomiting or the taking of laxatives.\nDo you have an eating disorder? Here are some questions. The more you answer yes, the more you should think carefully about your relationship with food.\n\u2022 Does food always occupy your thinking?\n\u2022 Do you feel any of these emotions when\nfaced with food; fear, anger, guilt, shame? \u2022 Do you think about your weight, body\nsize and the amount you eat, all the time?\n\u2022 Do feel you would be happier and more\nsuccessful if you lost weight?\n\u2022 Are you critical of yourself all the time?\n\u2022 Do you think thinness equal shap pi ness?\nIf you feel you have a problem If you feel you do have a problem the first step( slightly clich ed) is to recognise\nit.

    "content": "sing ton Traffic Competitions!!\nt Director: Steven Soderbergh Starring: Benicio del Torro,. Michael Douglas and Doni Cheadle\ni Steven Soderbergh's latest film\nis an expertly crafted tale\nabout the drug trade, explored] through a series of interrelated\nviewpoints. The film itself flicks\nperiodically between four groups of\nl people each involved with a drug\ncartel at different levels of the\norganisation.\nBenicio del Toro plays a cop in\ndarkest Mexico who soon becomes\nembroiled in the politics high up in\nthe organisation due to simply helping out the military in capturing\na\" assassin. The next two story-'ines start out from different perspectives but soon merge into one.\nCatherine Zeta Jones is the\nunsuspected wife of a wealthy drug trafficker, who following his\narr est, takes it upon herself to get\nner husband's trial perverted re9ar d less of the consequences.\nThis manifests itself as killing the\nrna in witness, who is being guarded by two police (Cheadle and Luis\nGu*r nan). Finally, Douglas plays\nthe new drug tsar for the US gove rn ment, whose daughter Ascends from a world of casual\ndrug use, to addiction and crime.\nAs I 've explained, desperately not\ntrying to give the plot away, the\nstructure of the film is very clever.\nThe most influential man finds he is\nat the end of the trafficking process i.e. watching a loved one\nbecome an addict, whilst the nondescript police officer soon realises\nhe is at the top of the ladder, dealing with corruption at the highest\nlevel. Each subplot interweaves\nintricately so that the audience can\nobtain a full grasp of an extremely\ndeep and detailed story.\nAs can be expected the acting is\nstraight from the top draw; with\nstrong performances from an\nimpressive cast. The charisma of\nCheadle and Guzman works particularly well, their chemistry and\nexcellent one-liners giving a welcome relief to what can be very\nintense scenes in the alternate sto-ry lines. However, whilst Douglas is\nimpressive as the government official, Zeta-Jones struggles to cope\nwith a part that has more depth\nthan other roles she has previously\nplayed. However, this is just a niggle and Traffic, will without doubt,\nbe one of the films of the year.\nTraffic is in cinemas now.\nSo now you've read the reviews,\nnow it's time to win the chance to\ngo and see one of the films we've\ncast our beady eyes over this\nweek. Our friends at the Odeon,\nHigh Street Kensington have kindly given us 2 pairs of tickets for Traffic. Just answer this\nquestion:\nDon Cheadle and Luis Guzman\nappeared in which 1998 Steven\nSoderbergh film?\nThe Kensington Odeon is located\njust on the corner of Earls Court\nRoad and High Street Kensington.\nRemember the special student rates they offer Imperial College\nstudents. As usual send your answers to this question to\nfilm. felix@ ic.a c.uk by noon\nWednesday.\nLast weeks answers: Mark Read is Chopper, Geoffrey Rush played\nPhilip Henslowe in Shakespeare in Love and Guy Pearce was in\nLA Confidential.\nWON A SCREEN COMPETITION AND NOT GOT YOUR PRIZE YET?
