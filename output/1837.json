But they made a good point;\nthere could be malicious intent. To that,\nI ask that everyone participating in this\nbook-sharing sheme, be kind to others\nand to share the love of the books. The\nbooks are there to be taken and perhaps\nkept forever, as the point of the bookshelf\nis to find homes, instead of trash cans for\nbooks that the previous owners did not\nwant to provide. Sound familiar?\nBooks and their stories are treasurers\nthat many of us take for granted. A good\nbook can feel as intimate as a diary and\nas groundbreaking as a news story. So\nlet\u2019s take this opportunity of finding new\nhomes for the stories we love.\nMany thanks to Andreea for letting my\ndream come true.\nQ: Old books in, new book out?\nA: Student Space Bookshelf!\nSherfield Level 3 Student Space now hosts a bookshelf for communal book\nexchange, to be used by students to donate and find new stories to explore.\n\n"

You ask yourself:\nwho captured the diversity of life\nbetter than the masters of the Renaissance? You remember Michelangelo, Raphael, Leonardo da Vinci,\nSandro Botticelli, Albrecht D\u00fcrer,\nand Johannes Vermeer. Enter this\nweek\u2019s theme: \u2018Accidental Renaissance\u2019.\nI\u2019ll admit, this was not a particularly easy one, so I present two\nstudent submissions, each evoking different aspects of the theme.\nThe photo on the left, All Hail the\nPhotographer by Hamza, shows attention to the subject, framed in a\ncelebratory and dramatic way, reminiscent of Raphael\u2019s The Deposition\n(1507), also known as Pala Baglioni.\nOn the right, Dat\u2019s photograph, The\nHustle, focuses on shadows and to-nalities, bringing to mind the Virgin\nof the Rocks (Louvre version 1483\u2013\n1486, London version 1495\u20131508)\nby Leonardo da Vinci. I recommend\nyou search for these paintings online to see the similarities for your-self.\nThe last picture shown here, a\nportrait, was not taken by a student,\nbut I provide this example as I feel it\nstrongly resonates with the theme.\nMigrant Mother (1936) by Dorothea\nLange is one of the most influential\npictures of all time, and is symbolic\nof the Great Depression. The photo\nhumbly shows how unchangeable\ncircumstances can weigh on everyday people. Compare this to Renaissance paintings such as Portrait of\na Man (Self Portrait?) (1433) by Jan\nvan Eyck, which typically show a\nwealthy, posed, and poised subject,\nand you immediately see the difference in subject choice compared to\nLange\u2019s.\nWhat brings these two seemingly distant interpretations of portraiture together is the search for\na realistic, human representation\nof reality. Both photo and painting\nstrive to be a mirror of their time.\nWhether during the Renaissance\nin paint or during the 20th\ncentury\nthrough photography, each artist\nwas a pioneer.\nAccidental Renaissance\nPHOTOGRAPHY\nHeadPhotographer\nROLANDO CHARLES\nJourney across the epochs: how photography and art go hand in hand.\nScan the QR code\nto submit for\nthe next theme\n\u2018Paranoia\u2018:\nAll Hail the Photographer Hamza Al-Aqqad The Hustle Dat Doan\nMigrant Mother Dorothea Lange\n\n"

This academic\nyear, we redesigned the newspaper\nto make it bolder and punchier. At the\nvery beginning of term, we delivered\n2,500 papers to all 13 undergraduate\nstudent halls, and our editorial team\nput in a monumental effort at fresher\u2019s\nfair to attract new contributors.\nWe started a weekly newsletter\n(sign up using the QR code on\nthe front page) that goes out to all\nFelix society members every Friday,\ncovering the news stories in each\nweek\u2019s paper \u2013 the idea of this\nbeing that you do not have to be a\ncontributor to the paper to become a\nmember of Felix.\nThe result of these efforts is that\nat the end of Term 1, and only three\nmonths into the academic year, we\nalready have 75% more members\nthan we did at the end of Term 3 last\nyear.\nOn social media, our Publicity\nOfficer Amy has been stellar, and her\nregular posts and stories have grown\nour Instagram following by 25% since\nthe end of the last academic year.\nThis term, Head Photographer\nRolando Charles launched West\nBasement Studios (WBS), Felix\u2019s\nvery own video production unit. You\ncan find WBS\u2019s YouTube channel at\nlinkin.bio/felix (click \u2018Check out our\nYouTube!\u2019). Their two videos feature\nImperial students and are well worth\na watch, with more content coming\nsoon.\nA huge thank you to all our\ndedicated editors and contributors,\nwhose enthusiasm has driven the\npaperforward,andtoyou,ourreaders,\nfor your continued engagement with\nour content.\nFelix started the year with the\nnews that Central Library would be\nrenamed in honour of Abdus Salam,\nin response to the 2021 History Group\nReport. That paper also featured\nreports by The Sun that Just Stop\nOil (JSO) was set to target Imperial,\nwith one student activist saying that\n\u2018ceremonies\u2026 would look great\u2019\n.\nWith this, Imperial\u2019s graduation\nceremony at the Royal Albert Hall\nlooked like it might be a target for\nJSO activists. But, as it turned out,\ngraduation proceeded without\nimpediment \u2013 even as other\nuniversities were splattered with\norange paint.\nFelix then reported on UCU\nImperial\u2019s marking and assessment\nboycott, which had resulted in delays\nto progression, grade confirmation,\nand exam results. One headline in\nmid-October read \u2018Marking mayhem\u2019,\ndescribing a complaint submitted by\n69 Physics students who claimed to\nhave lost one in every 10 hours of\nlectures to strike action last academic\nyear.\nThis term, the paper also covered\nhow the tragic events in the Middle\nEast manifested themselves on\ncampus. Jewish and Israeli students\nwrote a letter to President Hugh Brady\ndescribing their feelings of isolation\nand fear. \u2018We feel abandoned and\nthrown to the wolves,\u2019 they told him.\nThe following week, Palestinian\nstudents expressed disappointment\ntowards the President\u2019s comments\nat graduation, telling Brady he ought\nnot to \u2018speak in our name\u2019\n.\n\u2018Every night has its own unique\nsurprises, bombs you never\nexperienced before,\u2019 wrote alumnus\nNael Qtati in a series of harrowing\nmessages featured in Felix, describing\nthe terrible plight of Palestinians\ntrapped in Gaza.\nThen, last month, the paper\nreported on an Imperial scholarship,\nfunded in part by the College, for\nwhich candidates were vetted by the\nChinese Ministry of Education.\nFinally, in the penultimate issue\nof term, Felix returned to lighter\nreporting. Leading with the headline\n\u2018Mural monstrosity\u2019, the paper\nfeatured Imperial\u2019s renewed efforts\nto secure planning permission for a\nmural students described as \u2018horse\nsh*t\u2019\n.\nThank you once again for\ncontributing to and reading the paper.\nWe wish you a restful Christmas\nbreak, and a happy New Year.\nEDITORIAL\nSelina Ye Vecteezy.com\n\n"

Imperial+ unites sustainability initiatives from across the\nCollege and Student Union, enabling\nthem to share ideas and resources, with\nthe aim of making our campuses and\ndegree programs more sustainable.\nThe scheme was co-founded by Climate\nEntrepreneurs Club, AIESEC Imperial,\nEngineers without Borders Imperial,\nand Imperial Climate Action, with many\nmore student representatives \u2013 myself\nincluded \u2013 getting involved since.\nAs students, Eliott and Milan informed over 200 Imperial students and\nstaff about the global emergency in their\nworkshops during Sustainability Week\n2023 (read more in Felix issue 1822).\nThey are now employed by Imperial\u2019s\nEducation Office to examine the SDGs\naddressed in our curricula, but are also\nusing their new staff powers to bring bigger institutional change to Imperial.\nFor example, every Monday they invite\nstudents from environmentally focused\nsocieties, members of Imperial\u2019s environmental campaign groups, and the newly\nelected departmental sustainability officers for lunch. At these Monday Leaders\nLunches, I am learning about initiatives I\ndidn\u2019t know existed and meeting others\nwho care equally about making Imperial\ngreener. A recent topic of conversation at\nthese lunches was how to spread awareness of the climate and biodiversity crises to students who do not learn about\nthem in their degree. We brainstormed\nideas for how to do this, such as citizens\u2019\nassemblies held on Queen\u2019s Lawn and\nproviding free lunch at Imperial+ talks.\nAccording to the Imperial+ strategy document, there are five challenges\nthis initiative faces. The first challenge\nis identifying leverage points which\nwould maximise the pace of Imperial\u2019s sustainability transition. To solve\nthis, Imperial College Union Ethics &\nEnvironment Network is helping Imperial+ to map out all the sustainability committees and projects across Imperial, and\ndevelop a contacts directory.

Public funding is\nstretched thinly across various\ngovernment sectors as it is \u2014 if\nglobal climate mitigation were\nto take priority and receive adequate government funding, this\nwould likely have to come out of\nthe pockets of average citizens\nthrough increased taxation.\nTwo major alternatives to\npublic financing are private equity and philanthropy \u2013 both\nvaluable options for financing\nmitigation measures, which\ninclude research and development of innovative tech-nologies; retrofitting such as\ncarbon capture in fossil fu-el-burning power plants; and\nthe topical loss-and-damage\nfunding for the communities\nhit hardest by climate disasters.\nA report from McKinsey &\nCompany, a leading consulting\nfirm, outlines the 4P model \u2014\npublic-private-philanthropic\npartnerships \u2014 as an effective\nframework for funding organ-isations, particularly those in\nthe climate and environment\nsectors. Combining these different branches allows firms\nto take advantage of the best\nfacets of each funding source.\nOne such organisation that\nuses this 4P model is Breathe\nLondon \u2013 run by Imperial College\u2019s Environmental Research\nGroup \u2013 which is now expanding to become international.\nInitially financed by the philanthropic Clean Air Fund, Breathe\nLondon provides a platform for\na network of private, public, and\nphilanthropic organisations\nto collaborate on solving the\ncomplex issue of air pollution.\nIn the short term, the organisation aims to improve\nthe affordability of air-qual-ity-monitoring equipment;\nthough commonly used refer-ence-grade analysers are effec-tive, they are expensive and so\nare out of the reach of many\nlow-income communities. The\ninitiative has partnered with\nthe Mayor of London (public\nsector) to enable a city-wide\nrollout, between 2020 and\n2024, of cheaper air-quality\nsensors developed by Clarity\nMovement Co. (a private company based in the US). To ensure this can be implemented\nequitably, the sensors are being\nsponsored by Bloomberg Philanthropies and other donors.\nThe long-term goal of this initiative is to develop a network\nof air-quality monitoring that\ncan collect a comprehensive set\nof data across the whole of London. This data can be fed back\nto air-pollution research at Imperial, which can then inform\nthe development of area-specif-ic pollution-reduction policies\nand regulatory measures in the\nfuture. This long-term perspective allows for these kinds of investments to be focused more\nacutely onto the root causes of environmental issues.\nSince climate change is a\nchallenge even more socioec-onomically complex than air\npollution, organisations tackling climate mitigation could\nbenefit significantly from the\nmechanisms of the 4P model.\nHowever, achieving a strong\nnetwork of relevant stakeholders such as this one requires a\nhuge amount of time and re-sources, and consideration of\nnot just environmental goals\nbut also social development\ngoals such as improving public health. This is why it makes\nsense to build climate funding\ninto existing philanthropic endeavours with large pools of\nfinancial resources and established connections to both pri-vateandcharitableinstitutions.\nThough the individuality of\nprivate equity removes the need\nto contend with public opin-ions, it also poses a glaring issue\nwith these financing methods:\nthe disproportionate weighting\nof individual agendas in such\nfirms. Typically, major financial\ndecisions in private firms are\ndriven by a board of directors\nor a few chief officers, which\nleaves the process vulnerable to\npersonal biases and opinions.\nIn a not-entirely surprising\nturn of events, the first few\ndays of the COP28 climate summit saw its president, Sultan Al\nJaber, exposed for having said\n\u201cThere is no science out there\u2026\nthat says that the phase-out of\nfossil fuels is what\u2019s going to\nachieve 1.5\u00b0C.\u201d in an interview\nin November. The Financial\nTimes reported on leaked documents outlining a plan to use\nthe conference as a platform for\noil and gas business deals. Al\nJaber\u2019s affiliation with the Abu\nDhabi National Oil Company is\na prime example of how powerful individuals can influence\nthe direction and agendas of\ndecision-makers on the world\nstage. (@bloomberggreen and\n@earthrise.studio are excellent sources on Instagram for\nan overview and insight into\nhow COP28 is progressing).\nThis leads back to one of the\nchallenges of relying on private\nequity for climate-change efforts and green finances: how\nto leverage and incentivise\nthese firms to invest in environmentally friendly practices.\nExploration of the nuances in the relationship between\nthe consumer market and the\nactions of private firms and\ncorporations would be a whole\narticle unto itself, though one\nthing can be said for certain:\nthat public scrutiny and consumer demands are always\nstrong drivers for change.\nIn recent years, the concepts\nof corporate social responsibility (CSR) and environmental,\nsocial, and governance (ESG)\ninvestments have gained solid traction in the commercial\nworld. In simple terms, CSR and\nESG are sets of ethical and environmental standards by which\nto hold private corporations\naccountable. For all their flaws,\nsuch as the potential to lead\nto greenwashing, these standards are still valuable incentives for driving environmentally conscious investments.\nSo, the viability of private\nequity for climate and green\nfinance really depends on\nmultiple factors. The willingness of private actors to invest\nin climate-change mitigation\nand environmental issues; in-centivisation of this from social pressure; and the ability\nto take a multiple-stakeholder\napproach, which tends to result in more robust and bet-ter-informed investments. At\nthe end of the day, more of the\nworld\u2019s financial assets are in\nthe hands of individuals and\nprivate firms than that of gov-ernments, and it makes sense\nto keep looking for ways to\nexploit this in the interests of\nprotecting the natural world,\nand, by extension, ourselves.\nTo close out on a lighter note,\nI hope the purpose of Outside the\nBox has become clear over the\ncourse of this term: to bring attention to and critically analyse\npressing environmental issues.\nIn particular, to highlight humanity\u2019s impact on the environment and our waning connection\nwith nature. Most importantly, I\nhope to introduce concepts and\nless-discussed topics that might\nbe new to the readers of Felix. If\nyou have any thoughts \u2013 positive\nor negative \u2013 about the articles in\nthis section, I would love to hear\nfrom you (by email or Teams).\nUse the Christmas break to reflect on some of these matters,\nand if you feel inspired to write\nplease send us your articles!\nIs private\nequity the\nanswer\nto climate\nchange and\ngreen\nfinance?\n\u001f\u001e\u001d\u001c\u001b\u001a\u0019\u0018\u0018\u0019\u001b\u0017\u0016\u0015\u0014\u0013\u0019\u0018\u0012\n\u001f\u001e\u001e\u001d\u001c\u001b\u001a\u0019\u0018\u0017\u0016\u0015\u001d\u0014\u0013\u001d\u0012\u0013\u0011\u001a\u0010\u0017\u0015\u0017\u000f\u0011\u000e\n\n"

It\u2019s important to\nunderstand and represent them,\u201d explains\nCojocea.\nHer next big roles came in her fourth\nyear of study, when she was a committee\nmemberforFeministSocietyandWellbeing\nRepresentative for her cohort.\nAround halfway through the year, she\nrealised that as a sabbatical officer of the\nUnion, \u201cthen maybe my voice is actually\ngoing to make a difference towards\nimproving students\u2019 experience.\u201d\nShe spoke to a friend, and to Nathalie\nPodder, then Deputy President (Welfare),\nbefore running for the role herself.\nAndreea\u2019s goals\nAndreea lists four main goals on her\nICU webpage (though it is clear from our\nconversation that she has far more projects\nin the works):\n\u2022 Improving mental health\nprovision.\n\u2022 Lobbying the College for more\nfinancial support in combatting\nthe stress caused by the cost-of-living-crisis.\n\u2022 Taking action to decrease the\noccurrence of sexual misconduct\non campus.\n\u2022 Streamlining procedures\nfor those in need of\nguidance and support.\n\u201cSomething that is very\nexciting this year is that\nI\u2019m working very closely\nwith the College on the\nMental Health Strategy action\nplanning,\u201d says Cojocea.\nIn June 2023, Imperial published its\nMental Health and Wellbeing Strategy,\nwhich sets out how it will ensure\nstudents (and staff) get the \u2018support and\nadvice they need, when they need it.\u2019 It\nconsists of nine broad strategic goals,\nbut, says Cojocea, \u201cThis year they are\nworking on a more specific plan to make\nsure they actually achieve it.\u201d\nThe Strategy action planning process\nis a good example of how the Union\ncan improve student\u2019s experiences.\n\u201cImperial values the Union\u2019s input very\nmuch,\u201d says Andreea.\n\u201cThe way this is done is that we have\na set of meetings with the College. We\nslowly progress, first by suggesting lots\nof ideas that could be implemented\nunder the strategy.\u201d\nAndreea has already told Imperial\nthat they could provide better training\nto departmental staff who have frequent\ninteraction with students.\n\u201cThe first point of contact for\nstudents, for example, is their\npersonal tutor \u2013 Imperial\nencourages this. So at the\nvery least, the tutors should be\naware of the services available\nto students, and signpost them\nwhen approached with issues.\u201d\nShe wants to provide more in-depth\ntraining to personal tutors and other\nstudent-facing staff. \u201cMental health is a\nvery important issue, and I don\u2019t think\nsimple discussions are sufficient. For\nexample, something I\u2019m doing right now\nis preparing to become a mental health\nfirst aider [MHFA].\u201d\nI point out that Physics students last\nyear, students specifically complained to\nFelix that MHFAs were telling students\nto \u2018work harder\u2019 when approached with\nproblems.\n\u201cTo be able to act in these cases, the\nCollege first needs to know, so I would\nrecommend that students make a\ncomplaint against the specific\nstaff member. There\u2019s a form\nyou can fill out, and you select\nwhether or not you\u2019d like to\ndisclose your identity.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s alright to make staff aware\nthat you\u2019re not doing great or that\nthe people that you\u2019re in contact\nwith are not being very helpful.\u201d\nShe also encourages students\nto reach out to her or to the\nUnion\u2019s Advice Service, which\nprovides \u201cconfidential, non-judgemental advice free\nof charge\u201d. \u201cThis can be\nrelated to financial concerns,\nhousing, academic misconduct,\nor bullying, and they can also\nsignpost you to other resources.\u201d\nWe move onto her next goal, on the\ncost-of-living crisis.\n\u201cSomething I\u2019m trying to do here is\nto make sure we cover all students in\nterms of access to financial support,\u201d\nshe explains. (The College provides a\nbursary, but this is only accessible to\nhome undergraduate students.)\n\u201cI\u2019ve been doing research and the\ngroups most impacted by the crisis are\ninternational students, students who are\nparents or carers, those with disabilities,\nand obviously all those from a financially\ndisadvantaged background.\u201d\nCojocea says she is also\nworking with the Postgraduate\nRepresentation Chair to\nunderstand the costs specific\nto postgraduates, and with the\nUnion\u2019s Community and Liberation\nnetworks to identify those who might be\nin more immediate need of money. \u201cThey\nmight need access to financial resources\nto pay for emergency procedures, but\nnot have access to them, as none of the\nexisting funds are tailored to them.\u201d\nShe is currently helping the College\nwith its widening participation\ninitiatives. \u201cSo encouraging more\nstudents to apply to university, and\nunderstanding why some groups might\nbe facing barriers to higher education.\u201d\nShe says there will be student\nconsultations this month, and that\nstudent feedback would be valuable.\nCojocea\u2019s penultimate goal is to take\naction to decrease the occurrence of\nsexual misconduct on campus. \u201cThere\u2019s\na terrible lack of training about what we\ncan do to be mindful of other people,\u201d\nshe says. \u201cIt\u2019s an essential skill to\ndevelop.\u201d\nCojocea says she would\nlike to provide more\ntraining to students.\nThis year, she was\nassured that training\nwould be provided in\nhalls. But staff shortages\nmeant that the promise fell through,\nand instead, it was delivered online.\nShe would also like to create annual\nsurveys on sexual misconduct at\nImperial. \u201cDoing it annually would help\nus to see if the results are replicable and\ndraw conclusions.\u201d\nICU\u2019s last sexual misconduct survey\nreport came out in 2021, and found that\nthe Union\u2019s bars were the most common\nvenue for sexual harassment. Cojocea\nwould seek to address this by providing\ntraining to Union bar security, though\nshe notes this is made challenging by\nthe fact that such staff work for external\nagencies.\nShe says Imperial is keen to raise\nawareness of its SafeZone app, that\nallows all students and staff to request\nimmediate help from internal Campus\nSecurity if they feel unsafe.\n\u201cSomething else I want to lobby the\nCollege on is to improve its consent\ntraining. I think it would be great\nto remodel It as consent and active\nbystander training. Because I think\nthere are third parties in some situations\nwhere sexual misconduct can occur, and\nthey have the power to help.\u201d\n\u201cReach out and talk to me\u201d\nCojocea asks if she can conclude the\ninterview with a message to students:\n\u201cI want to take the opportunity to let\nstudents know that I would be very\nhappy for them to reach out and talk\nto me about experiences that they\nare facing. Everyone experiences life\ndifferently, so any input that they have\nis highly valuable in anything.

However, these are largely limited\nto technical rather than social, historical, political and\njustice related issues. The broad topic of the climate cafe\nwasthereforeguidedbyseveralpromptssuchas:\u201cDothe\ndepartment\u2019s ties to fossil fuel companies help \u2018greenwash\u2019 them?\u201d Furthermore, several guests were invited\ntoprovidedifferentperspectives\u2013includingalumni,former oil and gas (O&G) employees, as well as members of\nICA, and other climate activists. The world cafe format \u2013\ninvolving rounds of small group discussions and feeding back to the whole group \u2013 was used to facilitate\ncasual and friendly discussions.\nI have summarised these discussions here for other\nImperial students and staff to think about what climate\naction they can take.\nTheories of change were the most frequently recurring topic. Some students suggested that they could\nchange the culture and direction of O&G companies\nfrom within. Former O&G employees pointed out that\nthis would take years to do and is not aligned with the\nurgency of the climate crisis. One guest suggested that\nsuch a change was at odds with a deeply ingrained culture of exploiting fossil fuels, which has seen renewable\ndepartments at O&G companies downsized. Another\nguest said the attitude in the O&G industry was one of\n\u201cthe last man standing\u201d.\nSeveral discussions focussed on education, and the\ntension between training highly qualified engineers and\nhaving a broader education that includes social science\naspects of climate change. An argument in favour of the\nlatter was the students\u2019 appreciation for the discussions\nthemselves.Most sustainability courses are electives in\nthe third year and fourth year, and some students said\nthat they had \u201cdiscussed climate change more in the\npast two hours than in their entire life.\u201d\nReferencing carbon capture and storage (CCS), one\nstudent asked: \u201cAre fossil fuels the problem, or is it\nclimate change?\u201d CCS was viewed by many attendees\nas a crucial part of reaching net zero by 2050. However, one guest warned that CCS was frequently used to\njustify continued O&G extraction despite the IEA and\nIPCC unequivocally opposing this. The guests strongly\npromoted the need to take decisive and substantial action in the next few years to stay below 2\u00b0C of warming.\nOne student observed that the disappointing lack of\nprogress with CCS possibly contributes to its image as\n\u2018greenwashing\u2019: a term used when a company misleads\nthe public to believe that it is doing more to protect the\nenvironment than it actually is. Another student also\nmentioned that CCS would be the first step to decarbon-ising heavy industries such as concrete and steel.\nAn interesting appearance in the conversations was\neconomic pressures. These included the Chemical\nEngineering Society\u2019s previous and present O&G sponsorships and the need for financial support from the\nUnion to support the transition to more sustainable\nsponsorships. In addition to this, attendees emphasised international students being unable to afford an\neducation at Imperial or get a UK visa unless sponsored\nby O&G companies. Attendees noted that the systemic\nnature of these pressures would be greatly reduced if we\nlived in fairer, less unequal societies.\nOther points raised were harder to categorise, such as:\n\u2022 our societies\u2019 dependence on fossil fuels, such as\nin plastic and petrochemicals, and how to break\naway from it\n\u2022 the need for behavioural changes like reducing\nenergy demand as well as technological, efficien-cy-led solutions\n\u2022 the difficulty of fighting climate change in corrupt or otherwise undemocratic states, and\nwhether this includes the UK\n\u2022 the injustice for developing economies to prevent\nthe use of fossil fuels and slow development despite historically not developing on fossil fuels,\nand the need to challenge the link between fossil\nfuels and development\n\u2022 the general lack of Black, Indigenous and other\nPeople of Colour in climate movements\n\u2022 the need for positive visions of the future in climate movements fighting against fossil fuel use\nThe world cafe format ensured the event was a\nsuccess. The guests, students and staff all appreciated the possibility of\nhaving frank, calm, and\nremarkably friendly dis-cussions. Many were grateful to learn about climate\nchange this way rather than\nthrough a presentation or\npanel discussion. Chemical\nEngineering Society will be\nback next year with a similar event.\nSebastian graduated from\nImperial\u2019s Chemical Engineering course in 2018.\n\u001f\u001e\u001d\u001c\u001b\u001a\u0019\u0018\u0017\u0016\u0015\u0014\u001b\u0015\u001d\u001d\u0013\u001b\u0015\u0014\u0012\u0011\u0017\u0010\u001b\u0013\u0011\u000f\u0017\u001a\u0018\u001b\u001c\u0019\u000f\u001d\u0017\u001a\u0019\u0010\u001d\u0017\n\u000e\u0013\u001b\u0015\u0014\u0011\u0017\u0011\u000f \u001d\u0015\u000f\u0011 \u0017\u0019\u001a\u000f\u001b \u001b\u0011\u000f\u0011 \u0017\u0019\u0015 \u0017\u0010 \u0013\u001c\u001d\u0013\u0017 \u001b\u0018\u0017\n\u0019\u0015 \u0017\u0014\u0019\u0011\u0017\u001d\u001c\b\u0018 \u0007\u001d\u001d\u0011\u0017\u000f \u0014\u001d\u000f\u001e\u001d\u0013\nENVIRONMENT\n\u001f\u001e\u001d\u001c\u001b\u001a\u001e\u0019\u0018\u001e\u0017\u0016\u0015\u001b\u001c\u0017\u0018\u001b\n\u001f\u001e\u001d\u001c\u001f\u001b\u001a\u001c\u0019\u0018\u0017\u0016\u0019\u0015\u001c\u001b\u0016\n\u001f\u001e\u001d\u001c\u001b\u001a\u0019\u001f\u0018\u0017\u0016\u0017\u001e\u001b\u0015\n\n"

Extra is one way to\nput it \u2013 assiduous is another. She comes\narmed with a notebook filled with all of\nthe projects she wants to talk about in our\ninterview, and consults her laptop screen\nperiodically as we talk.\nCojocea says she had a pleasant\nchildhood. \u201cI grew up in Romania. For 19\nyears, that\u2019s where I lived \u2013 where I was\nborn and went to school.\u201d\nGrowing up with her parents (\u201cThey\u2019re\nboth philosophers, although they do\ndifferent jobs now\u201d) imbued her with a\nnatural inquisitiveness.\nDuring her school years, she says she\nwas passionate about maths, which \u201cfit\nin quite well with what the Imperial\nBioengineering course offered.\u201d\nAnd so, in 2019, she moved to London\nto study at Imperial. \u201cOverall, I\u2019m happy\nI did it, although it was a big jump. My\nexperience as a student at Imperial \u2013 not\nnecessarily academic \u2013 has been tough.\u201d\n\u201cWhen I came to study here, I had\neverything I had ever wanted for: an\nindependent life, where I knew I could do\nwhatever I wanted \u2013 I could have milk and\ncereal for breakfast, lunch and dinner.\u201d\n(She nods and laughs when I ask if she\nactually did this.)\n\u201cI had an infinity of opportunities to\nmake new friends and join clubs and\nsocieties, projects, and events in general.\nAnything that was fun.\u201d\n\u201cBut for some reason, I couldn\u2019t have\nbeen sadder. Coming to Imperial impacted\nmenegatively,especiallymymentalhealth.\nSome would blame it on the weather,\nothers on the fact I was away from family.\u201d\n\u201cPerhaps also there was something in\nthe lack of support and signposting that\nexacerbated things. But more on that\nlater.\u201d\n\u201cAnd then, towards the end of my first\nyear, when I was feeling truly lost, the\npandemic hit. This is a very unpopular\nopinion, but I think it\u2019s actually what saved\nmy \u2018career\u2019 as a student. I was able to go\nback home, take some time off, and think\nabout how I wanted to proceed with my\nstudy.\u201d\n\u201cMy second year was delivered mostly\nonline, and that was actually my best year.\nI don\u2019t want to be insensitive. I know the\npandemic had huge negative impacts\non the finances and wellbeing of many\nfamilies \u2013 including mine \u2013 but the quiet\naspect of it really helped me put things in\norder and reprioritise. I came back in third\nyear more energised than ever, ready to\ntake on the world.\u201d\nThird year was \u201ca little chaotic\u201d. \u201cIt\nwas just a bit confusing to pay attention\neverywhere, both online and in person, and\nI had to commute from South Kensington\nto White City.\u201d\nIn her fourth and final year though,\nCojocea says she had \u201cthis rebellious\ntendency to take back the time I had spent\nat home in second year. So I joined lots\nof clubs and societies, and I found that\nbecoming parts of groups, making friends\nand socialising with people, it helped me\nfind motivation to carry on in my work.\u201d\nHer interest in her current role \u2013 Deputy\nPresident (Welfare) \u2013 can in some ways be\ntraced all the way back to her childhood.\n\u201cGrowingup,Ihadaninterestinmymental\nhealth, and why I had certain reactions to\nsituations and why those might differ to\nother people\u2019s.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s funny, I used to take all the certified\npersonality tests to understand myself\nbetter. People in school would think I was\na bit weird.\u201d\n\u201cI was surprised then, given all this\ninterest in maintaining good mental\nhealth, at how bad I felt in my first year.\nIt felt like a contradiction of everything I\nstood for.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to make it sound like I\nnever had any difficulties growing up.\nAlso, to some extent it\u2019s normal to feel sad\nfrom time to time. Constant happiness\nis overrated, and maybe the fact we hold\nonto it so tightly creates unrealistic\nexpectations.\u201d\n\u201cBut coming here was scary and I hadn\u2019t\nanticipated the magnitude of it.\u201d\n\u201cI also noticed that a lot of people\naround me were also dealing with poor\nmental health. I wanted to help out, but I\ndidn\u2019t know how to.\u201d\n\u201cOne big issue is that mental health is\na theme that is still very stigmatised, so\nstudents find it difficult to reach out. A\nlot of people at Imperial are international\nstudents like myself. So when we come\nhere, we might not be familiar with the\nservices that are available to us.\u201d\nCojocea\u2019s first foray into student\nrepresentation at Imperial College Union\n(ICU) came when she joined the committee\nof IQ, Imperial\u2019s society for LGBTQ+\nstudents. \u201cI was campaigns officer and I\nalso became the liaison officer between the\nIQ Society and the LGBTQ+ Network.\u201d\nICU\u2019s Liberation and Community\nNetworks are \u2018run by students who\nidentify with, ally with, or are interested\nin [a] particular group\u2019. The nine networks\nprovide communities and safe spaces\nfor students, and organise campaigns to\ntackle problems their members face. They\nrange from \u2018International\u2019 and \u2018Ethics\nand the Environment\u2019 (both Community\nNetworks) to \u2018Disabilities\u2019 and \u2018LGBTQ+\u2019\n(Liberation Networks).\n\u201cThere are so many intersections\nthat can occur when students are part\nof different groups, and that can lead\n\u001f\u001e\u001d\u001c\u001b\u001a\u0019\u001d\u0018\u0019\u0017\u0016\u001d\u0015\u0014\n\u001f\u001e\u001d\u001c\u001b\u001a\u001f\u0019\u0018\u0017\nIn this series, Felix talks to the\nUnion\u2019s Officer Trustees.

The planning\nprocess is extensive, involving various stakeholders,\nwith designers finalising their collections well in ad-vance.\nThefashionshow\u2019svenue,hostedlastyearatClapham\nGrand, draws a full house of roughly 600 attendees,\nhighlighting its popularity. Chloe recalls her experiences walking the show for two consecutive years, describing it as \u201camazing\u201d.\nFor Kat, it\u2019s an opportunity to witness friends showcase a different side while fostering a vibrant community spirit. Beyond the glamour and style, the fashion\nshow acts as a catalyst for personal growth. Participants\ndiscover newfound self-confidence, break free from\nconventional moulds, and explore their creativity. Chloe\nemphasises how the show helped her find her unique\nvoice within the rigid confines of ICSM, while Kat highlights the supportive environment that nurtures confidence in every participant.\nThe upcoming show\u2019s theme focuses on sustainability and recycling trends, a departure from previous editions centered on identity. One can expect to see garters\nand slip dresses from the 1950s, suits from the 1990s,\nand 21st century casual wear. Embracing the ideals of\nanti-fast fashion, this year\u2019s show aims to revive beauty\nfrom the past, incorporating sustainable practices, up-cycled materials such as fishnets from the oceans, and\nhandmade pieces from smaller-scale designers, as well\nas inviting Imperial students with their own established\nor non-established fashion brands to lend their pieces\nfor the show.\nAnticipation grows as the event approaches, especially surrounding the afterparty, promising three hours\nof revelry and a chance for models to mingle with the\ncrowd. With tickets ranging from \u00a315 to \u00a318, the organisers strive to make it student-friendly amid the increased\ncost of living.\nAs Chloe and Kat prepare for the upcoming event,\ntheir dedication and vision embody the spirit of this\nempowering fashion extravaganza. For those involved,\nit\u2019s more than just a runway \u2013 it\u2019s a platform for self-ex-pression, empowerment, and community celebration.\nWhen asked for a final statement, Kat and Chloe\nspoke about how most people fear the expectations associated with being a model: to look a certain way, to be\na dancer, and so forth. However, that is not the case with\nthis show. It is run by students, for students. It encourages models to be themselves. Kat and Chloe hope that\nby having more students, not only medics, attend this\nyear, they can inspire them to audition the following\nyear and take part in this transformation.\nFollow @icsmsufashionshow on Instagram to keep\nup with the show\u2019s latest news.\nCollege School of Medicine Fashion Show\n\n"

There\u2019s a\nbold contrast between the technical form of this novel\nand the ornate content of it: corridors cleaned to perfec-tion, daily servant affairs, and delicate musings about\nthe English landscape, are placed onto the grit and asphalt that leads to Devon, Mr Stevens\u2019 destination.\nWhy this novel has remained in such high regard\nto this day is much due to Ishiguro\u2019s voice mimicking\nhuman consciousness, embodying how Mr Stevens has\nled himself to a full devotion to his career.\nSegues, comments, and musings happen in the inner\nspace of Mr Stevens\u2019 thoughts, which, since childhood,\nhave been constructed by his years as a manservant. The\nreal success of a novel is shown in whether its writer has\ncreated a polished mirror in which the reader can re-flect, especially what they might not initially see as such.\nThus, realisations conveyed of Mr Stevens about himself\nfeel at the very least well-earned, but in a realistic sense,\nthunderous.\nIn writing The Remains of the Day, Ishiguro talks of\na period of intense focus he called \u2018the Crash\u2019 during\nwhich he wrote the first draft of the novel in a four-week stretch. Funnily enough, this seems analogous to\nthe continuously typewritten first draft of On the Road,\nanother novel which captures revolutionary ideas, that\nJack Kerouac is said to have completed in three weeks.\nIt seems that as a result of this, Ishiguro was able to\nform some of the novel\u2019s most provoking self-contained\nideas, such as how Mr Stevens distinguishes a good butler from a bad one. \u2018It is surely a professional responsibility for all of us to think deeply about these things,\u2019 he\nremarks.\nThis comes from a purely enjoyable passage, with\nmuch of the comedy from the subtext of witnessing Mr\nStevens\u2019 private ideas. \u2018It is sometimes said that butlers\nonly truly exist in England,\u2019 Ishiguro writes. \u2018[People\nfrom other countries] are unable to be butlers,\u2019 which he\ngoes to explain is \u2018because they are [...] incapable of the\nemotional restraint of which only the English race [is]\ncapable.\u2019\nBut, being part of an academic institution, there is\ntruth in the irony of the way Mr Stevens presents his ideals that could describe the one-mindedness with which\nwe might face our studies.\nTo paint a picture of this, through Mr Stevens, Ishiguro conjured the image of all of time being funnelled\nthrough the eye of a needle, the thread of which adds a\nstitch into an imagined fabric of purpose. The lesson is\nnot what you expect: Mr Stevens seems to be pointing us\nat not what people do, but who they are, and Ishiguro is\ntelling us to question what exactly the pillars that hold\nup ballrooms and dining halls in our conscience, are\nmade of.\nInterestingly, Ishiguro portrays himself as anyone but\na holder of the most coveted award in literature: the Nobel Prize. \u201cI wanted to be a rock and roll star first [\u2026] I\nwas fixed up with writing, like an arranged marriage.\u201d I\nhighly recommend his interview with Charlie Rose. He\nalso mentions wanting to be a filmmaker and screenwriter in this 1995 interview. In 2023, he was nominated for an Oscar in Best Adapted Screenplay for the film\nLiving.\nThe end of the Autumn Term at Imperial is an interesting time for all Imperial students, because it calls for\na moment to look at the summer passed, and the term\njust gone. With the all the memories and mistakes, and\nmeaningful experiences had, it is a period to take what\nwe have learned, and consider the year to come, and see\nthe beauty in what remains. As Robert Frost ends up\nwriting about the season, \u201cNothing gold can stay\u201d.\nThis is the second article in our Moving Literature series,\nexploring literature read while commuting on London transport (not just the Underground).\n\u001c\u001b\u001d\u001a\u0019\u0019\u0018\u0017\u001d\u0016\u0017\u001d\u001b\u0015\u0014\u0013\u0012\u0015\u001d\u001b\u0015\u0019\u001d\u0011\u0010\u000f\u0012\u0015\u001b\u001d\n\u000e\u0019\u0018\u0018\u0014 \u001d\u0014\u001a\u001d\u000f\u001b\u0017\u001d \u0016 \u0019\u0010\u0011\u0016 \u001d\n\u0015\u0016\u0017\u001d\u001b\u0016 \u0019 \u001d\u0014 \u001d \u0019 \u001d\b\u0019\u0016 \u000f \u0012\u001d\n\u0016 \u0010\u0014\u0017\u0017\u001d\u001b\u0015\u0019\u001d\u0017\u0019\u0016\u0017\u0014 \u0017\u0007\n\u201c\n\u001f\u001e\u001d\u001c\u001b\u001a\u0019\u0018\u0017\u0016\u0015\u001c\u0014\u001b\u0013\u001a\u0012\u0014\u001e\u0011\u0010\u0016\u000f\u001a\u0012\u001b\u001c\u0015\u001e\u0011\u000e\u0017\u0016\u0011\u001a \u001a \b\u0007\u001a\u0006\u0013\u0005\u0004\n\u001f\u001e\u001d\u001c \u001b\u001a\u0019\u001c \u001e\u001d\u0018\u0017\u0016\u0015\u0014\u001c \u0018\u0015\u001b\u0013\u0012\u0016\u0015\u0014\u001c \u0015\u001d\u0011\u001c \u001a\u0010\u001d\u001e\u001c \u000f\u0012\u001e\u0016\u000e\u0013 \u0018\u000e \u001c \u001e\u001c\n\u000e\u0016 \u001b\u001c \u0011\u0018\u0015\u0013\u001c \u0013\u001a\u001c \u0013\u0018\b\u001d\u001c \u000e\u001a \u001d\u001c \u0013\u0016 \u001d\u001c \u0013\u001a\u001c \u0007\u0018\u0013\u0007\u0012\u001c \u0019 \u001c \u001a\u0015\u001c \u001b\u001a\u0019\u001e\u001c\n\u0006\u001a\u001a\b\u000e\u0012\u001d \u0005\u001c \u001a\u0010\u001d\u001e\u001c \u0013\u0012\u001d\u001c \u0006\u001e\u001d\u0018\b \u001c \u000f\u001a\u0015\u000e\u0016\u0017\u001d\u001e\u001c \u0011\u001e\u0016\u0013\u0016\u0015\u0014\u001c \u0005\u001a\u001e\u001c \u0019\u000e\u001c \u0016\u0015\u001c\n\u0004\u001a\u001a\b\u000e\u001c\u0003\u001c\u0011\u001d\u0002\u0017\u001c \u001a\u0010\u001d\u001c\u0013\u001a\u001c\u0012\u001d\u0018\u001e\u001c\u0005\u001e\u001a \u001c\u001b\u001a\u0019\u0001\n\u007f\u001d\u0015\u0017\u001c \u0019\u000e\u001c \u001b\u001a\u0019\u001e\u001c \u0016\u001d\u0007\u001d\u000e\u001c \u0018\u0013\u001c \u0006\u001a\u001a\b\u000e\u0081\u0005\u001d \u0016\u008d\u008f\u0016 \u001d\u001e\u0016\u0018 \u0081\u0018\u0007\u0081\u0019\b\u0081\u001c\n\u0090\u0012\u001d\u000e\u001d\u001c\u0007\u0018\u0015\u001c\u0006\u001d\u001c\u001e\u001d\u0010\u0016\u001d\u0011\u000e\u009d\u001c\u0017\u001d\u001d \u001c\u0017\u0016\u0010\u001d\u000e\u001c\u0016\u0015\u0013\u001a\u001c\u0018\u0019\u0013\u0012\u001a\u001e\u000e\u001c\u001a\u001e\u001c\u0014\u001d\u0015\u001e\u001d\u000e\u009d\u001c\n\u001e\u001d\u0007\u001a \u001d\u0015\u0017\u0018\u0013\u0016\u001a\u0015\u000e\u009d\u001c\u001a\u001e\u001c\u0018\u0015\u001b\u0013\u0012\u0016\u0015\u0014\u001c\u001d \u000e\u001d\u001c \u0016\u0013\u001d\u001e\u0018\u0013\u0019\u001e\u001d \u0018\u0017\u00ad\u0018\u0007\u001d\u0015\u0013\u0081\n\u0006\u0015\u0019\u001d\u001b\u0015\u0010\u0019\u0016\u0005\u001d\u0014\u001a\u001d \u0015\u000f \u0015\u001d\u0016\u0005\u0005\u0017\u001d\n\u0016\u001d\u0017\u001b\u000f\u001b \u0015\u001d\u000f \u001b\u0014\u001d\u0016 \u001d\u000f\b\u0016\u0012\u000f \u0019\u0005\u001d\n\u001a\u0016\u0011\u0010\u000f \u001d\u0014\u001a\u001d \u0013\u0010 \u0014\u0017\u0019\u0007\n\u201c\nEditor\u2019s Note\n\n"

    "content": "felixonline.co.uk | felix@imperial.ac.uk | @felix_imperial\n12 | environment 8 December 2023\nSchedule for Imperial+ retreat on 14th\nDecember. Imperial+\nThe reach of educational projects and sustainability\ncampaigns could be maximised by targeting points of\nintersection in this map. \u201cUp until now Sustainability\nDevelopment Goals-related efforts at Imperial have\nbeen very fragmented,\u201d says Evie Wright from the Imperial College Union Ethics & Environment Network. \u201cDifferent groups aren\u2019t necessarily aware of each other\u2019s\nwork and it can be difficult to find the correct people to\nhelp bring ideas to reality. I\u2019m truly excited about Imperial+ and its potential to connect so many like-minded\npeople.\u201d\nThe second challenge is how to transform culture\neffectively. Imperial has a reputation of producing\ngraduates who work very hard on their specific field of\ninterest and engage little with social sciences. Social\ntransformation is as important as technological innovation for fighting the climate crisis, but conveying this\nto the average Imperial student is currently difficult.\nImperial+ aims to empower STEM students and staff to\nhave a bigger social impact. The third challenge Imperial+ faces is ensuring a long-term, sustainable positive\nimpact. If initiatives are student-led, they may die out\nonce interested students graduate or are busy with stud-ies. This is why Imperial+ wants to connect student-led\ninitiatives, and ensure there are always students willing\nto take each other\u2019s events or campaigns forward. Staff\nare at Imperial for longer than students, so staff-led sustainability initiatives may last longer. This links to the\nfourth challenge, which is creating effective teams\nincluding both students and staff. Undergraduates,\npostgraduates, and staff each bring different levels of\nsustainability expertise and interact with Imperial infrastructure differently \u2013 Imperial+ aims to pool these\nexperiences together. The final challenge is the biggest:\nknowing where the initiative\u2019s blind spots are. The\nmore students and staff engage with the initiative, the\nmore we can learn about what Imperial is already doing\nto become greener, and what more can be done.\nTo engage with the initiative, Imperial+ is inviting all\nImperial students, staff, and alumni to a day-long sustainability retreat on Thursday 14th\nDecember with the\ntitle \u2018Year in Reflection and Building Momentum for\n2024\u2019. Though advertised as a retreat, the event will take\nplace in Sherfield Building on South Kensington cam-pus. Like all Imperial+ events, this is an opportunity to\nnetwork with other environmentally conscious people\nat Imperial. Collaborating with other sustainability projects at Imperial \u2013 rather than competing with them for\nrooms, funding, and membership \u2013 is a focus of the re-treat. Attendance of individual sessions is encouraged\neven if all-day attendance is not possible.\nSustainability-related clubs, societies, projects, and\ncampaigns are especially encouraged to participate in\nthe retreat. Imperial+ is asking any societies attending as a delegation to email imperialplus@imperial.\nac.uk with the name of a correspondent (\u2018Sustainability\nChampion\u2019) for the day\u2019s activities.\nImperial+ Sustainability\nRetreat Day\nThursday 14th\nDecember\nAims\nA unique opportunity for the Imperial sustainability community to reflect,\nconnect and celebrate 2023, as well as to build momentum for 2024 to become\nworld leaders in sustainable education, research, careers, campuses and experi-ence, by connecting across silos and moving from competition to collaboration.\nOrganised by the Imperial+ community, involving staff, students and professional facilitators, aiming to foster lasting connections around shared challeng-es, and providing a deep experience, setting the Imperial Sustainability Ecosystem in motion for 2024.\nOutcomes\nThe event will yield an Imperial Sustainability Initiatives of 2023, and How We\nAre Building Momentum for 2024 Report, including a touchpoints diagram\nof all initiatives. This will be complemented by collaboratively crafted plans\nfor your departments and initiatives to tackle shared challenges alongside at\nleast one other group. We\u2019ll also develop a map and a directory of the Imperial\nSustainability Ecosystem, aiding everyone in grasping each project, its needs,\nchallenges, and expertise to be shared\u2014propelling Imperial towards leading\nthe sustainability transformation. Ultimately, the event will foster a culture of\nconnection, strength, celebration, gratitude, and hope.\nImperial+\nI am learning about\ninitiatives I didn\u2019t know\nexisted and meeting others\nwho care equally about\nmaking Imperial greener.\n\u201c\n\n"
