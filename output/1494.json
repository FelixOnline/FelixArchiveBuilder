    "content": "FELIX\n10\nIn brief\nSCIENCE\nScience Editors: Kelly Oakes\nCharlie Harvey\nThea Cunningham\nscience.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFriday 24 june 2011\nBlack future for coal miners\nDecades after pit closures that claimed 170,000\njobs across England, coalfield communities continue to suffer from chronic arthritis, asthma and long-term back problems.\nResearchers at Durham University found that people living in coalfield areas were 27 per cent more\nlikely to suffer from a limiting long-term illness. The\nresults suggest that more government assistance\nand focus is required if coalmining communities are\nto be given a chance at regeneration and improved\nhealth.\nAccording to the findings, regeneration efforts\nin some less-deprived coalfield communities have\nhelped improve health and economic stability, but\npoorer areas have found it more difficult to bounce\nback. These communities may have to rely on government initiatives to tackle inequalities with wealthier areas.\nOne such initiative, the Coalfields Regeneration\nTrust (CRT), has pledged \u00a330 million to help coalfield areas overcome health and skills inequalities,\nachieve economic growth, and become self-sustain-ing communities. Andy Lock, Assistant Director at\nCoalfields Regeneration Trust said: \u201cWe know that\nhealth problems are still very severe in some places\nand our challenge from Government is to continue\nto address health inequalities. Our success is built\non working collaboratively with communities and to\nsupport their responses to local health needs.\u201d\nThe pit closures between 1984 and 1997 left coalfield areas environmentally degraded and in poor\neconomic condition. Many were isolated in rural ar-eas, with poor infrastructure and little opportunity\nfor commercial growth or tourism. The effects of\nthese closures are still being felt in England\u2019s poorest areas, leading to long-term medical conditions\nand widespread unemployment.\nKate Hazelhurst\nThe dream of spaceplanes has often been dismissed as fantasy, born out of bad 1950s science fiction films. According to most industry\nanalysts, the rightful place of the spaceplane\n\u2013 along with food pills, floating cities and personal jetpacks \u2013 is consigned to the dustbin of\nhistory.\nHowever, one small company in Britain\ndoesn\u2019t seem to have got this message. Oxford\u2019s Reaction Engines Ltd believe that they\nnow have the technology to turn this dream\ninto reality.\nThe reason that so many experts have long\nbeen sceptical of spaceplanes is simple: the\namount of fuel required to propel them into\norbit makes them extremely heavy. When the\nSpace Shuttle launches, it is connected to a\nhuge orange tank, which holds the liquid oxygen fuel required for the Shuttle to escape the\nEarth\u2019s atmosphere. Carrying this enormous\namount of fuel is not a problem for the Shuttle, as it takes off vertically \u2013 like a traditional\nrocket. But with a true spaceplane, there is\nsimply no way to carry this much liquid oxygen without making the vehicle far too heavy\nto ever get off the ground.\nYet now, Reaction Engines Ltd believe that\nthey have come up with an ingenious solution\nto this problem: breathable rocket engines.\nRather than carrying large amounts of liquid\noxygen fuel, Reaction Engines Ltd\u2019s Skylon\nspaceplane will have an engine which is capable of using oxygen from the air as its fuel\nsource, thus avoiding the necessity of carrying large volumes of liquid oxygen fuel. Upon\nreaching an altitude where the air becomes too\nthin to continue using oxygen this way, Skylon\nwill simply switch its power source to a small,\nsecondary rocket booster of conventional de-sign. Recent tests of these engines have been\nsuccessful and the first orbital test flights of\nSkylon are planned for 2018.\nSkylon is controlled by remote and will\nhave the capability to put both astronauts\nand satellites into orbit. According to Mark\nHempsell, Future Programmes Director at\nReaction Engines Ltd: \u201cSkylon will be able to\ncarry 15 tonnes to a 300km equatorial orbit,\nwhich is pretty comparable with the Space\nShuttle.\u201d\nYet, Mr Hempsell is keen to stress that the\ncomparisons with NASA\u2019s Space Shuttle end\nhere. The Shuttle has become notorious for its\nlong and difficult turn-around times, whereas\nMr Hempsell claims that Skylon will be ready\nto go back into orbit just two days after land-ing: \u201cOur turn-around will mostly be taken\nup by hull inspection, in order to make sure\nthat we haven\u2019t received any micrometeorite\nimpacts that we weren\u2019t aware of. Everything\nelse you don\u2019t touch. That\u2019s how the two day\nturn-around time is achieved.\u201d\nHowever, not all share Mr Hempsell\u2019s opti-mism. Christopher Carr, a Senior Researcher\nat Imperial College\u2019s Space and Atmospheric\nPhysics Group, believes that getting the necessary government support for this project may\nprove trickier than anticipated. He says: \u201cSkylon would be fantastic, but we don\u2019t do these\nbig kinds of technical development in Britain\nanymore. It would be a bit like us doing Concorde again. It would be great, but is our government really committed to supporting this\nlevel of programme? Or, is it going to be yet\nanother case of a great British idea that eventually gets built by some other country?\u201d\nPerhaps Mr Carr is right; maybe the right\npolitical and economic climate just isn\u2019t there\nat the moment. However, all of the early signs\nseem to show that Reaction Engines Ltd really do have the technology in place to support\ntheir claims.\nPerhaps this is exactly the sort of innovative\nproject our Government should be investing\nin, if it is to boost our economy and, at the\nsame time, restore Britain\u2019s position as a world\nleader in aerospace technology.\nAndrew Purcell\nBreathing life into spaceplane technology\nWe\u2019ve got to go back, I think I left the back door unlocked...\nScience Question Time\nTuesday 5 July 2011 from 6.30pm\nJoin a panel including the editors of Nature and\nResearch Fortnight, to discuss the impact of science\non economic, academic and political matters.\nRegister online at:\nsciencequestiontimejuly2011.eventbrite.com\nQuantum Uncertainty, Does God play dice?\nThe most recent Friends of Imperial event was\na lecture by theoretical physicist Antony Valentini given to a packed SAF lecture theatre. The\ntopic, Quantum Uncertainty, was a popular one:\nthe fact that the half the audience had iPads and\nthe other half had walking sticks \u2014and one\nrather cool gentleman had both \u2014 represented\nthe diverse crowd that such a topic could attract.\nMost theoretical physics lectures that generate\nlarge audiences do so off the back of a German\nman with distinctive hair, and this talk was no\nexception. The sub-heading of the lecture was\ntaken from a famous letter from Albert Einstein\nto Max Born, in which he wrote: \u201cQuantum\nmechanics is certainly imposing. But an inner\nvoice tells me that it is not yet the real thing. The\ntheory says a lot, but does not really bring us\nany closer to the secret of the \u2018old one.\u2019I, at any\nrate, am convinced that He does not throw dice.\u201d\nIn the broad introduction to the field Dr Valentini agreed with Einstein\u2019s sentiment, deriding\nthe \u201cpseudo-spiritual\u201d nature of most popular\ninterpretations of quantum mechanics, describing the uncertainty principle as mysticism and\ncomplaining that to view a solid definable concept of reality as old fashioned as wrong.\nHis alternative theory focused around an\noverlooked quantum mechanical model, the\nPilot-wave theory of motion proposed by Lois\nde Broglie. Using the same mathematics as the\nmuch more commonly recognised Copenhaagen Interpretation, the Pilot wave theory results\nin a deterministic interpretation of quantum dy-namics, hence the idea that God does not play\ndice. By explaining everything without recourse\nto equations, Dr Valentini struggled at times to\nsatisfactorily explain all his concepts, but given\nthe complexity of the topic at hand, the audience did its best to keep up. This was especially\nthe case towards the end of the talk, where definitive proof of more deterministic quantum\ntheory was apparently to be found in the Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation, due to\nthe conditions in the universe just after the big\nbang being different to as they are now.\nThe lecture ended there, as this was as far as\ncurrent research extends. It felt a little unorthodox for a public lecture to have such an open\nended finale with no answers, but it gave a good\nimpression of the challenges facing Dr Valentini\nand his colleagues. It seems lonely being at odds\nwith a large portion of the scientific community,\nbut the lecture was a fascinating insight into\nthe fundamental questions remaining in a field\nwhich many people considered wrapped up.\nMatt Allinson\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX 11\nSCIENCE\nFriday 24 june 2011\n\u201cIt got to the stage of desperation, I tried\nGPs, neurologists, psychiatrists and\nother types of psychotherapists... it was\npurely because I was out of any other\nchoices that I tried it.\u201d\n\u2018It\u2019 was medical hypnosis and it reduced Timothy Ellison\u2019s weekly migraines to monthly mild headaches.\nTimothy had to seek private help be-cause, although hypnosis has been practiced for a long time in the private sector,\nit has never been offered by the NHS.\nThis may all be about to change. Last\nMonday, recommendations made by the\nRoyal Society of Medicine\u2019s Hypnosis\nSection stated that \u201cThe NHS could\nsave millions of pounds if it made better use of hypnosis for a wide range\nof common conditions.\u201d The hypnosis\nthey talk about is completely devoid of\nthe swinging watches and semi-magical\nqualities of myth. Instead it sounds like\nany other medical tool - sharp, efficient\nand precise.\nIt is a tool that is able to help people\nwith depression, irritable bowel syndrome and chronic pain that other more\nconventional methods can\u2019t treat.\nYolanda Rengifo Aguirre, the psychotherapist that treated Timothy\u2019s condi-tion, says: \u201cIn my experience, therapy in\nthe trance reaches parts of the patients\nthat other psychotherapies do not reach.\nIt is effective in changing the clockwork\nof the mind, such as the subconscious\ninner patterns of being in the world that\nmake us ill and distressed.\u201d\nYolanda used clinical hypnosis to\n\u201cshow Timothy the origin and maintaining factors of severe psychogenic\nmigraine headaches. Hypnosis can be\neffective in working to resolve and heal\nany trauma or inner psychological conflict that could be subconsciously triggering it.\u201d\nTimothy said: \u201cHypnosis helped me\nin discovering why I had migraines. It\nhelped me respond to stress in a way that\nwas not self-harming, by noticing the\nearly signs in my body as a warning de-vice. These signs tell me to relax instantly and so avoid triggering the migraine.\u201d\nClinical hypnosis therefore gives insights into psychosomatic conditions\nthat other techniques simply cannot do.\nIn its ability to find subconscious caus-es, hypnosis is effective in treating anxiety induced disorders from panic attacks\nIs hypnosis all it\u2019s hyped up to be?\nCamila Ruz\nTrying to get laid before beer was invented required far more ingenuity...\nMartin Lacey stands proudly in the centre of the big top, arms splayed, red suit\nbarely stretching over his ample belly.\nHis ungainly appearance is deceptive.\nTo a roar from the crowd, he drops to\nhis knees as a flash of white and black\npasses above his bald head. The lion\nlands with a snarl, and the audience rise\nto their feet, gasping with delight as it\nsettles by Lacey\u2019s side like a Golden\nRetriever. He stands and bows to rapturous applause. The show is a success.\nFor one of these performers, the reality of success is a difficult life on the\nroad, training for hours each day and\npacing a cage smaller than the average\nliving room.\nEarlier this month, the Department for\nEnvironment Food and Rural Affairs\n(DEFRA) released what it calls a \u2018tough\nnew licensing regime\u2019 for animals used\nin circus performances. Assessment criteria include transport conditions, size\nof living quarters, and treatment by animal trainers. According to Environment\nSecretary Caroline Spelman, the stringent guidelines will improve quality of\nlife for performing animals.\nA noble aim indeed, but will it be\nenough? In 2009, Professor Stephen\nHarris and his colleagues at Bristol\u2019s\nSchool of Biological Sciences completed a comprehensive survey of circus\nanimal welfare worldwide.\nWhat they found is hardly surpris-ing. \u201cQuite simply, there should be an\noutright ban\u201d said Professor Harris,\nspeaking from the Mammal Group Lab\nat Bristol University. \u201cWe don\u2019t need\nanimals in circuses\u2026the requirements\nof these animals are so specific you just\ncan\u2019t meet them in a circus environment.\u201d\nIt seems that the British public agree.\nA government opinion poll in 2010\nrevealed that 71% of the UK public\nsupport a total ban on all performing\nanimals across the UK. Of DEFRA\u2019s licensing proposal, Professor Harris said\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a rather farcical process. I\nmean, if you look at the welfare situation in zoos it is pretty terrible anyway,\nand those animals are kept in one place.\nSo in circuses, well, there simply aren\u2019t\nany welfare standards.\u201d\nMartin Lacey\u2019s white lion and other\nexotic creatures will continue to perform for delighted crowds across the\ncountry, and perhaps they will be better protected from poor treatment at the\nhands of their owners.\nBut if pressure and petitioning from\nwelfare groups, charities, higher-profile\nscientists and the public continues, DEFRA may be forced to take a stronger\nstance.\nGovernment calls for better circus animal welfare\nto insomnia. Hypnosis can also be used\nas a tool to help treat more complicated\ncases of psychological distress such as\nanorexia and bulimia: \u201cThey learn why\nthey behave in a particular manner and\nhow to change their responses before\nthey occur. These are the responses that\nwere automatic or compulsive in the\npast, that\u2019s why I use clinical hypnosis\nextensively in the effective treatment\nof eating disorders,\u201d says Yolanda. The\npinpointing of these mental habits is\npart of what makes medical hypnosis so\neffective in cutting the recovery time in\nmany of these cases.\nBut if medical hypnosis is so effective\nwhy haven\u2019t we heard more about it?\nThe problem is that it is currently only\ndone privately and when done by a fully\ntrained psychologist, as it has to be, it is\nextremely expensive - often up to \u00a3100\nan hour. As Timothy said: \u201cHypnosis\nchanged my life. I think it could benefit\na great number of people. I am sorry for\nthe people that cannot afford treatment\nand are suffering as I suffered.\u201d Putting\nit on the NHS would bring medical hypnosis onto the radar of people have run\nout of choices, giving people like Timothy another chance.\nxxx\nThat tasted ggggreat\nKate Hazlehurst\n\n"

Bogdan started nervously, perhaps\na reflection of the importance of the occasion with the match being recorded\nand, for the first time, scored live on\nthe club\u2019s web site, and eventually lost\nthe opening frame. Tim led marginally\nthroughout the next but a fluked pink\ndrew Bogdan level. A neatly composed\n18 clearance\u2014the highest break of the\nmatch\u2014saw Bogdan pinch frame four\nand an early 30-point advantage in the\nfifth soon resulted in the Freshers\u2019Tournament 2010 champion advancing to his\nsecond final this season.\nBy contrast, the second semi-final\nwas more entertaining, although the\n55-minute first frame was full of safety\nplay, where Richard slowly built up a\n22-point lead that Bilal nudged to zero\nbefore stealing the frame with a 15\nbreak to the pink. The story was much\nthe same in frame two, however Bilal\nturned on the style in the third to record\nthe second-highest break of the tourna-ment, a well-crafted 46 in a brilliant\ndisplay of break-building. He might\nhave cleared up in a subsequent break\nbut, unaware of the rule preventing the\nuse of a ball off the table to determine\nwhether a colour would spot after being\npotted, he was stopped prematurely for\nthis unusual foul.\nIt made no material difference to that\nframe nor the next as two 16 breaks allowed Bilal to open up a 40-point gap\nbefore Richard could pot a ball. Yet, in a\nreversal of the first two frames, Richard\nplayed his best snooker of the match in\nscoring breaks of 25 and, with a fluke-assisted blue, 21, but a couple of loose\nsafeties quickly enabled Bilal to take the\nframe to a re-spotted black. After a long\npot attempt, Richard was unfortunate\nto double-kiss the black when he tried\nto play safe, leaving Bilal a straightforward pot into the top-left corner pocket\nto conclude the game.\nSo the two best players are five frames\naway from becoming Imperial\u2019s top\ncueist. They share the highest 11 breaks\nof the Internal League, headed by a 53\nfrom Bogdan in the first group stage,\nand have only lost three of the 43 frames\nthey have played between them. If the\nplayers reproduce the quality of snooker\nthey have demonstrated this season, we\nwill be treated to an enthralling match\nworthy of any final.\nYou can join us for live scoring, statistics and text commentary of the final\ntomorrow evening from 5pm.\nMurray mania makes\nannual trip to SW19\n... Continued from Back Page\nThe cries that ring differ only by the\nforename. The shouts of \u2018come on Tim\u2019\nhave been replaced by \u2018come on Andy\u2019.\nThe weight, expectation and hope\nplaced on these three words weigh just\nas heavily as they have ever done. The\nannual frenzy surrounding Wimbledon\nevery year has begun. The nation follows with baited breath to see if we will\nfinally have a British Wimbledon champion after so many years of waiting. I\nshall not be among them.\nFirstly, let\u2019s start with the \u2018British\u2019\nChampion. Murray is Scottish and\nwhen, in the 2006 football World Cup\nEngland faced off against Trinidad and\nTobago (Scotland didn\u2019t qualify), Murray publically stated his support for\nT&T. Okay, support who you want but\nremember Andy, the majority of those\nsupporters who turn up at SW19 willing\nyou to win are English. In fact most of\nyour fan base are likely to be English.\nIt\u2019s best not to alienate them.\nWe can then seamlessly link to Murray\u2019s public persona, anyone who has\nevery seen a television interview by\nMurray is unlikely to remember it. In\nfact, they are more likely to have had a\nsnooze. Win or lose Murray shows no\nemotion. His interviews drone on in a\nmonotonous bored moan, in stark contrast to the eloquent and charming Roger Federer. Rafa Nadal is not the most\neloquent of individuals, lest us forget\nEnglish is not his first language, yet\nsome argue that could be the case with\nMurray too. It\u2019s not true that Murray is\ndevoid of emotion; he got rather quite\nupset following his loss in the US Open\nFinal. Much like that malignant growth\nJohn Terry did following Chelsea\u2019s failure to capture the Champions League in\nMoscow.\nReturning to Murray\u2019s petulance on\ncourt. He\u2019s already shown his child -ike\nbehavior in his first game of this year\u2019s\ntournament. Shouting in exasperation,\nswinging his racquet at the ground in\nfaux McEnroe anger, never capturing\nthe charm and charisma of the original\nrebel of the tennis world. It\u2019s embarrassing to watch Murray behave in such a\nway. Murray showed his weak temperament in the French Open this year when\nup against the clay court specialist;\nNadal. Whilst Murray wound himself\nup more and more, Nadal stared at him\nfrom across the court and physically\nwore Murray into the ground. It was a\njoy to watch. Playing against Nadal is\nsaid to be like hitting a ball against a\nbrick wall; it will always come back.\nNadal\u2019s style of play, his unwillingness\nto compromise his superstitious routines\nmake him a popular, charismatic player.\nMurray and charismatic will never be\nused together unless the prefix of \u2018un\u2019\nmakes an unusual M\u00e9nage \u00e0 trois.\nMurray probably will win a Grand\nSlam title; the once invincible Federer\u2019s\npower\u2019s are in decline, Nadal has had\nsome lengthy injuries, whilst Djokovic\ncould succumb to Murray\u2019s game. Until\nthat time comes, I shall revel in semifinal disappointments and heartbreaks\nwhilst fist pumping and shouting \u2018vamos\u2019.\nupwards of 50 now, not to mention the\nobvious relief from the stresses of academic life they provide.\nWe were sorry to say goodbye to Alissa Ayling in the early part of the year.\nHer role was key in facilitating the partnership of the Union and Sport Imperial,\nand has helped our clubs to climb ever\ngreater heights. Fortunately, Hannah\nBlandford has filled the role with great\nskill, and we look forward to working\nclosely with her in the coming years.\nThe ACC is set to have an all new\ncommittee next year, with Henry Abbot\nand Phil Sandwell taking the reins as\nChair and Treasurer. The current committee is moving on, with some graduat-ing, and some moving on to Sabbatical\npositions in the Union. So if anything\ndoes go wrong, we\u2019ll be watching.\nA final note of thanks has to go to the\nmembers of all our ACC clubs. It seems\nfacetious to say, but without them, the\nACC would not be where it is now. Special thanks go to all the club committee members for their continual dedication to their clubs throughout the year,\nallowing their players to be able to do\nwhat they do best: play and win.

    "content": "FELIX Friday 24 June 2011 17\nBUSINESS\nFELIX\nBuffer \u2013 Because you want to tweet better\nAfonso Campos talks to to Joel Gascoigne about Buffer and startups in general\nbusiness.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nBusiness Editors: Sina Ataherian\nAfonso Campos\nhave liked to continue this project, he\ncame to abandon the idea as his fellow\ngroup members had different plans.\nFollowing university, and further\nproof that Gascoigne is a forward think-er, he co-created OnePage; a one-stop\nshop to easily and automatically disseminate your Internet presence, in the\nstyle of prominent sites such as about.\nme, before these even existed. Although\nthe project lasted over a year, it was not\na complete success and he did not get\nthe traction he desired. During the time,\nit also transpired that his co-founder and\nhimself, while good friends, just did not\nwork that well together; a most important of realisations.\nArmed with the experience of building two dynamic and intelligent web\napplications, Joel set upon getting Buffer off the ground. Joel is a keen follower and believer in the Lean Startup\nmethod, first pioneered by entrepreneur\nEric Ries, which advocates constant\ndeployment of features and launching\nwith a minimum viable product. Before\neven starting to build the application\nJoel wanted validation that his idea was\na good one, and put up a landing page\nwith a description of the product, different pricing levels and an e-mail form.\nWith careful analysis of the traffic on\nhis preliminary site he was able to track\nthe metrics that eventually validated his\nidea. He also gathered over 120 e-mails\nof prospective subscribers and immediately engaged in conversation with them\nto understand what they really expected\nand wanted out of Buffer. These conversations and his acorn of an idea became\nthe paramount shapers of the applica-tion. He then set about actually developing the website, which from start to\nfinish took Joel a mind-blowingly swift\nseven weeks to set up.\nWith the application up and running,\nJoel knew that in order to transform\nthe product from an idea into a real\nand scalable business he would not be\nable to do it alone. This is when Leo,\na young student and keen entrepreneur\nhimself came to the rescue. He is much\nmore than just a product evangelist or\nsimply Joel\u2019s right arm. He is an integral\nand vital part of the business. Despite\nthe lack of a technical background, Leo\nmanaged to previously hack together an\ninteresting cooking social network for\nstudents, giving Joel faith in his can-do\nnature. Having just finished his second\nyear exams, he is taking a year out of\nuniversity to focus exclusively on Buffer during this high-growth stage.\nAt the very earliest stages of Buffer,\nJoel had to keep freelancing in order\nto be sustainable, despite having his\nfirst paying customer within the first\nthree days of operation. Buffer has now\ngrown significantly to over 12,000 us-ers, a healthy portion of whom are\npaying. This has allowed Joel to stop\nfreelancing and dedicate his full attention to his creation. At this point, he\nisn\u2019t raking it in yet; in fact, he is making less money now than when he was\nfreelancing. Borrowing a phrase from\nthe prolific Paul Graham, Joel describes\nBuffer as \u2018ramen profitable\u2019. Something\ntells me Joel does not mind that the\nriches haven\u2019t yet come and relishes in\ncontinuing to develop the application in\nunique and interesting ways.\nHis product and idea are both, without\na shadow of a doubt, really great, but this\nalone is not what makes Joel a successful entrepreneur. He has a great attitude\nthat is to an extent shaped by some of the\nworld\u2019s best entrepreneurs. Joel finds it\nof the utmost importance to keep placing\nhimself outside the traditional comfort\nzone and finding challenges. He feels\nthat this is the only way to keep satisfied\nand truly learn in a continuous manner.\nWhen asked about his competitors,\nJoel was candidly frank. He knows they\nare out there and he acknowledges that\nthere are similarities in the product, just\nlike different car manufacturers embed\nsimilar characteristics in their vehicles.\nDifferent car brands get you from A to\nB, but what really matters is how they\ndo it. He invokes a quote by Henry Ford:\n\u201cThe competitor to be feared is one who\nnever bothers about you at all, but goes\non making his own business better all\nthe time\u201d. It\u2019s a decidedly healthy and\nrefreshing attitude in a world of startups\nobsessed with an idea and the eventual\nexit. In fact, Joel believes that an undue\nfocus on getting investment or exiting\neventually derails founders and drives\nthem to focus on the wrong things.\nBefore our interview was over, Joel\npassed some great advice to students\npotentially interested in entering the\nexciting world of startups. He thinks it\nis crucial to take advantage of the sum-mer, as there is unlikely to be a stretch\nin their lives that is so unconcerned with\ntime or money; two of the biggest constraints on young founders. He believes\nit to be the perfect time to really experiment and try new things. To that effect,\nJoel is always open to talking and helping out young startup founders, feeling\nthat having gone through the process\nvery recently, he is in tune with the worries and questions they may have.\nWith close to 350,000 scheduled\ntweets to date, Buffer is clearly on the\nuptrend. There is no doubt that as more\nand more companies and individuals\nfind their voices on Twitter, Joel and\nLeo\u2019s application will become increasingly attractive. While Birmingham has\nthus far been a good home for Buffer, as\nsoon as their lease expires next month,\nJoel and Leo are off to San Francisco\nto see for themselves the allures of the\nalmost mystical Silicon Valley. They are\nalready making ripples across the pond,\nwith the Twitter API big chief requesting a meeting with them.\nInterestingly, during my interview\nwith Joel, Buffer raked in almost another thirty users. To put things into perspective it took him a week to get those\nmany users when he first began.\nIf you take nothing else from Joel\u2019s\nstory, remember three key things: the\nimportance of simplicity of your prod-uct, the importance of a right co-found-er and the veritable will to make it happen no matter what. Expect great things\nfrom this duo.\n\u201cBuffer is a smarter\nway to Tweet\u201d \u2013 Joel\nGascoigne\nBuffer founders Joel Gascoigne and Leo Widrich planning world tweetmination. Maybe. If they can get over the OS war\nCheck out Buffer at http://www.\nbufferapp.com\nFind Joel\u2019s blog on: http://joel.is\nYou can also follow Joel on Twitter:\n@joelgascoigne\nT\nhe proliferation of Twitter is ubiquitous to say\nthe least and despite the\nservice being almost universally loved by its users,\nannoying your followers with a barrage\nof tweets is not a gargantuan task to ac-complish. Enter Buffer.\nBuffer is a simple, yet highly effective\nweb application that lets you add your\nmessages to be automatically tweeted\nat scheduled times, thus avoiding a\nbacklash in the form of decreasing fol-lowers. Its co-founder, Joel Gascoigne,\nputs it best: \u201cBuffer is a smarter way to\nTweet\u201d. I was lucky enough to drag Joel\naway from his text editor long enough\nto find out what makes him, and Buffer, tick.\nJoel, a Warwick University computer\nscience graduate has a long history of\nearly adoption of emerging trends.\nHe embraced the power of the web at\nthe almost premature age of 12 when\nhe first started creating websites, and\nthroughout university he worked as a\nfreelance developer and designer. It was\nnever his idea to leave university to set\nupon the typical route of the many students taking a graduate job: his aspiration was to be completely independent\nand build something substantial without\nbeing told what to do by anyone else.\nClearly one with a startup mindset,\nwhen the time came for his final group\nproject at university, Joel created an interesting location-based social network\nwhere your friends could check-in at\ndifferent places on campus. Joel\u2019s idea\nactually preceded the behemoths that are\nnow Facebook Places, Foursquare and\nthe prevalence of smartphones. While\nthe entrepreneurially minded Joel would\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX Friday 24 june 2011 15\nTECHNOLOGY\nAugmented reality is here\nJ\nust what is augmented reality?\nI was at an augmented reality\nconference recently and the best\ndefinition was this: \u201cAugmented reality is an integration of the\nreal world with computer graphics that\nyou can interact with.\u201d\nSo we are looking at something that\naugments your reality with something\nyou can play about with. A good name\nthen. But it\u2019s all very well and good creating a pair of goggles that overlay what\nyou see with floating unicorns and fairy\ndust, but it doesn\u2019t really add anything \u2013\nit\u2019s gimmicky. The general consensus of\nthe conference-goers was that the augmentation had to be useful.\nAugmented reality is only just emerging from that gimmicky stage. It\u2019s a\nyoung technology that is slowly coming\ninto the public eye. The main limitation,\nuntil now, has been the technology required for it to be both useful and un-obtrusive.\nThese limitations were twofold: the\nreliance on fiducials (those black and\nwhite square markers), and a lack of a\nbridge between the user and the augmented world. But in the age of the\nsmartphone, the latter issue is moot.\nNow it has become a lot easier for those\ninnovators in augmented reality to start\ndistributing their content to the masses.\nStill an infant industry\nOne such company at the conference\nwas Wikitude, showcasing their self-named augmented reality browser.\nAvailable on all major mobile operating\nsystems, Wikitude allows you to look at\nyour surroundings through your smartphone\u2019s camera. It will then overlay information and facts about what you can\nsee, including user-added content and\ngeo-tagged tweets. This is an interesting\nuse-case, and it certainly seems to be\npopular (it was voted the best augmented reality browser two years in a row).\nHowever, it lacks a great deal of interac-tion, and you have to walk around with\nyour smartphone in front of you to get\nthe effect \u2013 not a great look.\nSo the next step could be augmented\nreality eyewear \u2013 either glasses or contact lenses. Both of these options may\nbe less obtrustive, but there are, unfor-tunately, disadvantages to both. People\ndon\u2019t want to wear unstylish eyewear\njust for some extra facts about their\nsurroundings. With contact lenses it\u2019s\na technological barrier \u2013 not just getting enough pixels in a contact lens, but\nalso having them close enough together.\nThis is necessary to give the illusion\nthat the overlaid content is a lot further\nfrom the eye, else it would obscure the\nuser\u2019s vision.\nHowever, advances are being made in\nboth of these areas. Vuzix and DARPA\nhave both created pairs of augmented\nreality glasses that, while not supremely\nstylish, look more like futuristic sunglasses than lab goggles. On the contacts\nfront, the technology is a lot further be-hind, but is catching up. Researchers at\nthe University of Washington recently\nmanaged to embed a four-by-four grid\nof blue and red pixels in a single contact\nlens, close enough to avoid the aforementioned occlusion problem.\nOn the other hand, if Ken Blakeslee \u2013\nan investor in many companies involved\nwith augmented reality \u2013 is to be be-lieved, the glasses technology could be\nmade ready very swiftly. What is lacking is a consumer demand for augmented reality itself. Without this demand,\ncompanies and investors won\u2019t put the\nmoney required into research and development of the technologies.\nPerhaps with more advancements,\nthe general public may find something\nthat leads them to be more interested.\nThat said, in a time of recession and\ncareful investments, we\u2019re definitely\ngoing to need to get augmented reality\naway from being a gimmick. It needs\nto be something that enhances the user\u2019s life.\nThankfully, some people do seem to\nbe heading in that direction. One particularly interesting presentation was\nfrom Holition, who describe themselves\nas \u201cleaders in augmented retail\u201d. They\ndescribed an advertising/retail initiative\nthey had undertaken with Selfridges\nand watch manufacturer Tissot. Customers outside the store were given a\nsingle coloured watch band to put on.\nThey could then hold this up to a webcam above a screen on the wall of the\nstore to see a Tissot watch on their wrist\nin real time, and use that touch screen\nto customise the watch with immediate\neffect. In addition, they could take this\nwatch placeholder with them to use on\nthe Tissot website at home with their\nown webcam.\nThis is a great use for augmented re-ality. It brings benefits to both parties,\nwhich means it\u2019s exactly the sort of\ninitiative that will bring the technology\ncloser to the public eye. For the con-sumer, it saves a lot of time with trying\non the accessory, and allows them a lot\nmore customisation than they would get\nin the shops. It can save and even generate extra revenue for the company (as\nthey need make fewer watches if most\npeople use this system). This particular\nexample gave a return on investment of\nfour to one. It was also said that the trial\nwas considered a success, with others\nalso having been completed. This is a\nhopeful sign for pushing augmented reality forward.\nMaking it a reality\nSo where does the technology go from\nhere? It really needs something to push\nit forward, to accelerate its growth.\nAnd if investors aren\u2019t prepared to\nstump up their cash, maybe it will\nbe games that provide this spurt. The\ngames industry is huge, and if it were\nto adopt augmented reality en masse,\nit would almost certainly make it big\nvery quickly. This is definitely a possi-bility, as we\u2019re starting to see examples\nof this already.\nThe Nintendo 3DS is the main contender here, with its impressive augmented reality software. Effects such\nas apparently warping the surface that\nyou\u2019re playing on bring a worthwhile\naddition to the game, but perhaps without the 3D it wouldn\u2019t have such an ef-fect. But Nintendo aren\u2019t the only ones\n\u2013 Samsung demoed their AiRaid game\nat the conference. It\u2019s a game based on a\nsimilar concept to Nintendo\u2019s own Face\nRaiders, but at least it shows that companies are taking an interest.\nIt\u2019s good to see that some big names in\ndifferent sectors of the market are really\ngetting their hands dirty with augmented reality. It is an emerging technology,\nand it may still take a few years before it\ntakes off. But when it does, I\u2019m sure it\u2019s\ngoing to be huge.\nBut Chris Bowers examines whether it is all that it is cracked up to be\nDespite the fact that she can wear translucent purple tape over her eyes and still look attractive, keep in mind the same may not apply to you...\n\u201cResearchers at\nthe University of\nWashington recently\nmanaged to embed\na four-by-four grid of\nblue and red\npixels in a single\ncontact lens\u201d\n\n"

Boat have brought record numbers of medals home, with victories\nin all classes. At the BUCS 4s and 8s\nHeads, they won four golds, two silvers and four bronzes, earning second\nplace overall and more than 100 BUCS\npoints.\nThe greatest success this year has\ncome from Imperial\u2019s Fencers.

Never before had I realized\nthat you could transfer Thierry Henry,\nJimmy Floyd Hasselbaink and Fernando Hierro (to name but a few) to Leeds\nUnited and create a star-studded, world\nbeating super team. In truth in reality,\nyou couldn\u2019t, but through the wonders\nof modern technology, beautiful things\nwere possible.\nThe Young Vic\u2019s new re-working\nof the Nicolai Gogol\u2019s Government\nInspector brings to together a cast of\nsimilar traits. Julian Barratt of Mighty\nBoosh fame leads the cast that includes\nSmack the Pony\u2019s Doon Mackichan and\nFergus Craig, off, err, Star Stories. Ok,\nso maybe it\u2019s not quite a Leeds team of\n01-02, but the strength of this production came in the cast.\nThe play has been brilliantly reworked,\nadding touches that tailor the humour to\nan English audience and give little bursts\nof the kind of off-beat comedy that both\nMackichan and Barratt are so known\nfor (and Gogol not so much.) Combining 1830s Russian with touches of 1940s\nhorror films, the opening minutes seem\nfar from the play\u2019s origins, but give the\npiece a kookiness that will entertain the\nfaithful and intrigue the sceptics.\nBarratt appears not to play the role of\nthe Mayor, but rather let Howard Moon\ndo it, bringing a slightly awkward uneasiness to his presence on stage. Combine\nthis with a wardrobe camp costumes and\nthe Young Vic\u2019s usual frugal ingenuity in\nset construction, and at times, the production has slight touches of panto. Polished is not a word that sprang to mind.\nstory.\nLaurence Pope believes revision\nstress is more likely to blame, and has\nhimself been having a tough time re-Psycho Alice in post-exam wonderland\nDramSoc\u2019s free re-imagining of the intoxicating\ntale goes on the rampage on the Queen\u2019s Lawn\nGet Doon for Gogol at the Young Vic\nJulian Barratt takes the lead in the Russian classic, Government Inspector\nShamini Bundell\nWill Prince\n...and here\u2019s the Duchess relaxing at home\nThe Duchess David Beaton relaxes at the Summer Ball...\nKeith Pattison\n\u201cDespite Barratt\u2019s\nbig billing,\nMackichan does\nsteal the show a\nlittle\u201d\nBut each of the actors themselves,\neach member of the cast possessed a star,\nwinning quality. Their comic air and the\nnatural humour tended to prevail in the\nface of comedy\u2019s historical cornerstone,\ndelivery. Despite Barratt\u2019s big-billing,\nMackichan does steal the show a little.\nHer competition with her own daughter\n(played with ample squeakiness by Lou\nBrearley) to woo the \u2018Government Inspector\u2019 makes for a rip-roaring display\nof comedic crowd-control. The cherry\non the cake comes in the form of Dr.\nGibner, whose infrequent additions in\nGerman provide one of the funniest elements of the production.\nThe piece is novel no doubt, but\nweighs too much on the shoulders of\nBarratt, who in truth lacks the gravity\nand presence to carry the piece. I like my\nBoosh as much as the next man, but I\nfear the Government Inspector preaches\na fable of the TV/theatre divide. Sometimes it\u2019s just best to keep the stars in\nthe places they shine, in reality it never\nworks like it does on FIFA.\nYoung Vic until 9th July\n\u201cAlice is described\nvariously as a short\nAfrican medic, a\nmasters student with\na funky black fringe\nand a tall slim girl\nwith light brown hair\u201d\nadjusting to a post-exam lifestyle.

Why is a raven like a writing\ndesk? It\u2019s driving me mad. More tea?\u201d\nAlice is described variously as a short\nAfrican medic, a masters student with a\nfunky black fringe and a tall slim girl\nwith light brown hair. If you do see Alice on the Queen\u2019s Lawn this evening at\n6.30pm it is recommended that before\nseeking help you hang around for a bit \u2013\napparently watching her go mad can be\npretty funny.

After checking the black market price\nfor internal organs, Charing Cross Hospital\nrealised a multiple transplant was out of the\nquestion, opting instead for the radical treat-ment. According to surgeon Dr. Robert Pollington, \u201cthe patient had more bad bits than\ngood so we decided we may as well swap it\nout entirely. Besides, have you SEEN the prices for kidneys these days? Increasing demand\nfrom China has made them unaffordable.\u201d It is\nhoped that by transplanting the entire body the\nrisk of the cancer spreading will be minimised.\nDoctors reportedly briefly considered playing\na practical joke on the patient by picking a donor that is a known paedophile.\nThe procedure itself is fairly straightforward\nand safe: no incisions are required and the patient remains fully awake without an anaesthetic throughout, as it is completely painless.\nAdditionally unlike most transplant operations\nchance of rejection is low. It is not without\nside effects, however, which may include a\nsudden change in height, hair length and eye\ncolour (among other physical features), as well\nas acquisition of memories of the donor, even\nassuming their name and identity. The patient\nshould also prepare for the possibility of being\nnicknamed \u201cFrankenstein\u201d, or \u201cFrankenstein\u2019s\nMonster\u201d depending on how well-read and/or\npedantic the patient\u2019s peer group is.\nGo to festivals\nYou will tell everyone about it before.

    "content": "FELIX\n12\nSCIENCE\nScience Editors: Kelly Oakes\nCharlie Harvey\nThea Cunningham\nscience.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFriday 24 june 2011\nT\nhe last week has seen a\nflurry of excitement over\nreports that solar activity\nmay be set to decrease. Climate change deniers have\nsprung upon this news, with prominent\nDaily Telegraph blogger, James Delingpole, advocating that we increase\ngreenhouse gas production, in order to\nmitigate any cooling associated with\nthis decrease in solar activity. In an ar-ticle, which opens with the words \u201cIt\u2019s\nofficial: a new Ice Age is on its way\u201d,\nMr Delingpole goes on to claim that\nthe news \u201cmakes global cooling a much\nmore plausible prospect in the next few\ndecades than global warming\u201d. Mr Delingpole isn\u2019t alone. The Register was\nalso quick to pounce on this news, as\nwas Daily Mail columnist, Richard Littlejohn, who claimed \u201cthe world has\nactually been getting cooler in recent\nyears\u201d.\nSo, what is the evidence to support\nthese claims? Are we actually heading\nfor a new ice age, or are the climate\nchange deniers on some pretty thin ice?\nWell, Mr Littlejohn\u2019s claim is clearly\nnonsense, as the ten warmest years on\nrecord have all occurred since 1998.\nBut, what about the claim that the Earth\nis about to enter a new ice age? To judge\nthe merits of this claim, we will have\nto look a little more closely at the science\u2026\nThe Sun\u2019s activity is cyclical, with the\noverall strength of the Sun\u2019s magnetic\nfield rising and falling periodically.\nEach cycle lasts roughly 11 years and\nwe are currently approaching a solar\nmaximum, due in 2013. However, there\nis evidence to suggest that the next cy-cle, with its maximum expected in 2022,\nmay be significantly weaker. This prediction was made at a recent meeting of\nthe American Astronomical Society and\nis based upon observations that a gaseous river, which flows beneath the Sun\u2019s\nsurface, is forming at a slower rate than\nobserved during previous solar cycles.\nAlso, scientists have noted that the average magnetic strength of sunspots has\nbeen decreasing in recent years and that\ncoronal activity is unusually low at the\nmoment.\nYet, this doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that\nwe are likely to see a decrease in the effects of global warming and it certainly\ndoesn\u2019t mean that we\u2019re heading for a\nnew ice age. This proposed decrease in\nsolar activity is likely to lead to an average global temperature decrease of between just 0.1 and 0.3 \u00b0C. By contrast,\nanthropogenic global warming is set to\ncause an increase in average global temperatures of roughly 4 \u00b0C by the end of\nthis century.\nSimilarly, the predicted decrease in\nsolar activity could lead to a 4 per cent\nincrease in polar sea ice. This is \u2013 quite\nliterally \u2013 a drop in the ocean, especially\nwhen one considers the fact that global\nwarming is set to cause a 40 per cent decrease in polar sea ice.\nEqually, those celebrating this news\nas a long-sought-after excuse to keep\non burning fossil fuels and driving gas-guzzling cars seem to have conveniently\noverlooked a few other facts.\nFor one, there\u2019s the problem of oceanic acidification. Increased carbon\ndioxide levels will continue to acidify\nour oceans and destroy coral reefs,\neven if solar activity becomes significantly reduced. For another, what\nhappens when solar activity returns to\nnormal? Nobody is suggesting that the\npredicted decrease in solar activity will\nbe permanent, so any reduction in our\nefforts to tackle global warming would\nonly result in a potentially disastrous\n\u2018double-whammy\u2019 period of warming\nonce this period of low solar activity\nhas subsided.\nSuch a period of relative cooling may\nlast just the one 11-year solar cycle, but\nsome are predicting another Little Ice\nAge, such as that experienced from the\nmid-16th to the mid-19th century. During this period, winters were unusually\ncold and the Thames froze over regu-larly.\nHowever, despite widespread claims\nto the contrary, the links between decreased solar activity and this unusually cold period are not clear. While it\nis often claimed that the Little Ice Age\nwas caused exclusively by a period of\nlow solar activity, known as the Maunder Minimum, the Maunder Minimum\nlasted just 70 years, whereas the Little\nIce age lasted 300 years. It has been\nsuggested that the Little Ice Age could\nalso have been caused by high levels of\nvolcanic activity, or even a temporary\ndecrease in the functioning of the Gulf\nStream.\nDuring the Little Ice Age, the cooling\neffect is thought to have varied signifi-Global cooling?\nThis is a false-colour image of our sun. Thought we\u2019d point that out, you know, in case you forgot the Sun isn\u2019t blue\ncantly across regions, with Europe having been affected significantly more than\nNorth America for instance. Also, while\nwinters were generally much cooler\nduring the Little Ice Age, summers were\nnot as strongly affected. Thus, given\nthat climate change is already predicted\nto cause the UK to experience more extreme seasonal variation (i.e. warmer\nsummers and colder winters), a return\nto Little Ice Age conditions could be\nparticularly bad for the UK.\nLondon is roughly on the same line\nof latitude as Moscow and currently\nexperiences abnormally warm winters\n\u2013 given this latitude \u2013 due to the winter-warming effect of the Gulf Stream. If\naverage global temperatures continue\nto increase, causing ever-greater glacial\nmelt water to continue decreasing the\nsalinity of our oceans, this is likely to\nlead to major changes in the activity of\nthe Gulf Stream. Thus, winters in the\nUK will become drastically cooler.\nCoupled with a further potential decrease in winter temperatures, caused\nAndrew Purcell queries claims that decreasing solar activity will trigger an \u2018ice age\u2019\nby decreasing solar activity, this has the\npotential to be disastrous. Consequently, rather than diminishing the need to\ntackle climate change, the prospect of\ndecreased solar activity causing cooler\nwinters, serves only to add impetus to\nthe already drastic need to tackle climate change.\nOn a global scale, if the projected decrease in solar activity does occur, and if\nit does cause a limited global cooling ef-fect, this should be seen as a temporary\nreprieve, with the potential to buy us\nsome much-needed time to increase our\nefforts at reducing global atmospheric\nCO2\noutput. It should certainly not be\nseen \u2013 as the climate change deniers\nwould have us believe \u2013 as an excuse to\ndo absolutely nothing.\nThe hypocrisy of the climate change\ndeniers is truly staggering. Quick to\nrefute the overwhelming body of scien-tifically-sound, peer-reviewed evidence\nin support of global warming, these\nso-called \u2018sceptics\u2019 have jumped upon\nthese predictions of decreasing solar\nactivity unquestioningly; predictions\nwhich were made in provisional form at\na small conference in New Mexico and\nwhich have not yet been subjected to the\nrigors of peer review. It is worth bearing in mind that, even if these predictions do turn out to be accurate, the total\nenergy reaching Earth from The Sun is\nexpected to drop by just 0.1 per cent.\nIn light of this, the crowing of the\nclimate change deniers seems, at best,\nwoefully misguided and, at worst, wilfully misleading. Perhaps unsurpris-ingly, few of the climate change deniers\nhave made reference in their articles to\nthe fact that Dr Frank Hill, one of the\nscientists responsible for the predic-tions, chose to clarify things by issuing\nthe following statement:\n\u201cWe are NOT predicting a mini-ice\nage. We are predicting the behaviour\nof the solar cycle. In my opinion, it is a\nhuge leap from that to an abrupt global\ncooling, since the connections between\nsolar activity and climate are still very\npoorly understood. My understanding\nis that current calculations suggest only\na 0.3 \u00b0C decrease from a Maunder-like\nminimum, too small for an ice age. It\nis unfortunate that the global warming/\ncooling studies have become so politically polarising.\u201d\n\u201cThe total energy\nreaching Earth from\nThe Sun is expected\nto drop by just 0.1%\u201d\n\n"

R. Martin. A\nSong of Ice and Fire redefined the fantasy genre from the classic Lord of the\nRings-esque adventure quest cum bildungsroman story of good versus evil\ninto a darker, more adult and ultimately\nmore realistic domain. There is no clear\nboundary between good and evil in his\nstories. No subject is taboo and he does\nnot gloss over vices like sex, violence\nand incest. More importantly, main\ncharacters do die in his stories (Read an\nin-depth review of his series on the adjacent page).\nAlthough Martin or GRRM as he is\nknown to his fans, is now eponymous\nwith fantasy, he started his writing career in science fiction and horror short\nstories. A big fan of comic books and\nscience fiction novels from a young age,\nMartin started out writing for comic\nfan-zines but soon graduated into science fiction magazines like Locus. He\nattempted writing professionally after\ncompleting a journalism M.S. in 1971.\nIt was not a straightforward path, and\nMartin recalls having one of his story\nbeing rejected for 42 times by different magazines. After losing the Hugo\nawards (the science fiction and fantasy\nequivalent of Oscars) on numerous oc-casions, he finally clinched the rocket-shaped trophy in 1975 with his science\nfiction short story A Song for Lya. The\nnovella follows a young protagonist\nand his lover, both whom are telepaths,\n(called \u2018Talents\u2019) sent to an alien world\nin which a human colony is present, to\nassist with unravelling the mysterious\nhumanoid alien\u2019s religion. As the two\ntelepaths delve deeper into the alien\nculture, they discover a shocking truth\nabout the sacrificial ritual of the religion\nand they began to question the boundaries of emotional intimacy.\nFive years later, Martin would win the\ncoveted double crown of both the Hugo\nand Nebula award for his sci-fi horror\nnovelette, Sandkings. Highly imaginative science fiction backdrop with a\nstrong theme to accompany it, the story\nis about a wealthy playboy who buys\ncolonies of intelligent alien insects to\npit them in a gladiatior-style war against\neach other.\nIn the 80s Martin got into screen-writing, writing for Hollywood serials.\nHowever, in the early 90s, he got back\ninto writing novels, a medium in which\nhe could pull off all the grand scene\nhe always envisioned, for there is no\nbudget or logistical restriction when it\ncomes to writing. In 1996, the first book\nofASong of Ice and Fire series,AGame\nof Thrones was published. Inspired by\nthe War of the Roses in medieval England, the story deals with the conflict between major Houses in a struggle for the\nthrone of the Seven Kingdoms. Initially\nplanned to be a trilogy, the story grew\nas GRRM wrote it and it is now seven-book saga. GRRM has a penchant for\ngrowing stories, as demonstrated in the\nfourth and the upcoming fifth volume\nwhich are actually two halves of one\nbook.\nMartin is one of those authors with\na large following who actually makes\nhimself accessible to fans. He maintains\na friendly relationship with the Song\nof Ice and Fire fan club Brotherhood\nWithout Banners. He also blogs once\nevery few days or so at his grrm.live-journal.com. However, such strong fan\nfollowing has it irks. The initial anticipation abuzz the upcoming fifth book\nsoon turned to irritation and restlessness\namongst the fans as the publication date\nkeep on getting pushed further. Some of\nthem even took it upon themselves to\ntaunt Martin into completing the book.\n\u201cPull your fucking typewriter out of\nyour ass and start fucking typing\u201d complained a fan on a forum. Some fans are\nworried as well that Martin might just\nkick the bucket before he concludes the\nseries. The rising tide of disaffected fans\nhas got to the point where Martin himself had to retort against it in one of his\nblog post: \u201cAs some of you like to point\nout in your e-mails, I am sixty years\nold and fat, and you don\u2019t want me to\n\u2018pull a Robert Jordan\u2019 on you and deny\nyou your book. Okay, I\u2019ve got the mes-sage. You don\u2019t want me doing anything\nexcept \u2018A Song of Ice and Fire.\u2019 Ever.\n(Well, maybe it\u2019s okay if I take a leak\nonce in a while?)\u201d. Robert Jordan, the\nauthor of the bestselling fantasy series,\nThe Wheel of Time, died of heart disease before he is able to conclude the\nlast 3 novels of his 14-novel saga.\nThis March, Martin announced on\nhis blog that the book is set to be published on July 12 this year. He writes on\nhis blog \u201cYes, I know. You\u2019ve all seen\npublication dates before: dates in 2007,\n2008, 2009. None of those were ever\nhard dates, however. Most of them...\nwell, call it wishful thinking, boundless optimism, cockeyed dreams, honest\nmistakes, whatever you like. This date\nis different. This date is real. Barring\ntsunamis, general strikes, world wars,\nor asteroid strikes, you will have the\nnovel in your hands on July 12. I hope\nyou like it.\u201d\nA Song of Ice and Fire starts out with\nthe Seven Kingdoms under one rule\n\u2013 the Iron Throne at the capital, conveniently called King\u2019s Landing. The\nruling House is the Baratheons, who\ndeposed of the Mad King Targayen.\nTroubles stir as rumours arise that the\nwealthy and ambitious House Lannister\nare plotting to take over the throne. After the mysterious death of the King\u2019s\nHand (prime minister), Lord Eddard\nStark of House Stark, a close friend and\nconfidante of King Robert is summoned\nto King\u2019s Landing to take over the job\nof the King\u2019s Hand. So begins a series\nof events which would lead you through\na murder mystery, an incestuous secret,\nlots of Machiavellian political play and\nbackstabbing as everyone wants the\nIron Throne for him/herself.\nFor such a complex backdrop, it takes\na while for the characters and the world\nto be introduced, which makes the first\nfifty pages or so of the first book seem a\nlittle dull. But bear with it and you will\nbe rewarded, as when the conspiracies\nand drama takes off, you are in for a\nroller coaster ride as Martin drives you\nthrough cliffhangers and hair-raising\nthrills.\nThe story is told from first person\nPOV of different characters from both\nStarks and Lannisters. Every character has their own narrative arc, and the\nbreath and variety keeps the story fresh.\nJoin the honourable Lord Eddard Stark\nas he navigates the treacherous political landscape in King\u2019s Landing; follow the exiled young princess Daenerys\nTargaryen as she seeks to reclaim the\nthrone that was rightfully hers and loses\nher innocence on the way; partake with\nthe witty dwarf Tyrion Lannister in his\ndecadent indulgences, misadventures\nor just revel in his razor-sharp wit and\nequally sharp tongue. Those are but a\nslice from the large pie of characters.\nAnd as you progress from book to book,\nmore new characters are introduced. But\nfear not, you wouldn\u2019t end up with having to read and memorize 20 character\u2019s\nworth of story \u2013 for when you play the\ngame of thrones, you either win or you\ndie. That brings me to another aspect of\nMartin\u2019s writing: people die in his story.\nGoing against conventions of popular\nentertainment, Martin does not stay the\nguillotine with some conceived dues ex\nmachina just because the character in\ndeep shit is a main character. In a recent\ninterview with the New Yorker, Martin stated that he wanted the readers to\nfeel that \u201cthey love the characters and\nthey\u2019re afraid for the characters.\u201d The\nfragility of the character\u2019s fate makes\nyou more sympathetic to the characters\u2019\nlives and you gasp when the characters\ngasp.\nAdventures and all, the heart of the\nstory is the drama between the charac-ters. The complex interplay between\nthe relationships and motivations of the\ncharacters is one of the books\u2019 strength.\nIn some way, the books feel like a narrative in Machiavellian politics, with each\nparty conniving in their own plot to get\ninto power and trying to call the bluff of\ntheir enemies. It is a smart thriller and\nif you are one of those who enjoyed the\nintricacy of Inception, you would probably enjoy the intricate web of politics\nin A Song of Ice and Fire.\nGeorge R. R. Martin may be called\nthe American Tolkien, but his writing is\ncertainly not Tolkein-esque at all. The\nsubjects Martin deals with in his book\nwould probably rile Tolkien\u2019s sensibil-ity. He shows medieval life the way they\nare \u2013 sometimes romantic, but most of\nthe time harsh and cruel. There is a lot\nof sex in the story too. It makes you\nwonder sometimes, when reading Tolkien, where are the whorehouses in Gondor? How do hobbits do it? How about\nthe elves, what does being immortal do\nto your sexual urges? Well, Martin does\nnot answer those in his books, but his\ncharacters are like you and I, and they\ndo think of sex quite a lot.\nThere is also a characteristic lack of\nmagic in Martin\u2019s books. Unlike arche-typical fantasy books, magic is very\nsparse in Westeros. It is like our world,\nwhere magic is a thing of legend and\nsuperstition. That is why when magic is\nmentioned; a sort of awe accompanies\nit, as if it is a miracle.\nEvery once in a while, there comes an\nauthor with an imagination so verdant,\nand the skills to bring the story alive and\ninhabit it with an intriguing cast of characters as rich and complex as a rainfor-est. George R. R. Martin is one such. A\nSong of Ice and Fire was the herald of\nan age of fantasy writing that is darker\nand feels more \u2018real\u2019.\nGuo Heng Chin\nMaster of epic fantasy Dark tales of ice and tales\n\n"

The\nmen and women would\nstill be players, but of a\nvery different kind. And\nscientists would be the biggest gamers of all.\nWhen it comes to comparing gamers to sci-entists, the case is a compelling one. To do\nwell in a game, the player must test out how\nthe game works using the tools at their dis-posal. There\u2019s no way to win in a game world\nif you don\u2019t understand its rules (Tekken, per-haps, aside). \u201cWhat works and what doesn\u2019t?\nIs gravity the same as in real life? How much\ndamage does an alien take before it bleeds\nout?\u201d A scientist has to deal with a much more\nexpansive set of rules and environments, but\ntheir fundamental goal is the same: to understand how the world works, and then, poten-tially, exploit it for benefit.\nAs children, we play to learn the rules of the\nworld. \u201cWhat happens if I jump off this step?\nDo worms taste good? How long can I badger\nmy mum for a biscuit until she gives me one or\nyells at me?\u201d This is a simple form of experi-mentation, and our emerging view of reality is\nshaped by the results we get.\nAn extra level of sophistication can be added\nto turn play into a game: a system of rules.\nHide and seek would be a fairly pointless exercise if no-one was seeking. Games have been\naround for millennia, and their rules range in\ndetail enormously. Past a threshold of com-plexity, a game can offer space for a player to\nbe engaged, to experiment and to learn, both\nabout the game but potentially also about the\nworld. The board game Risk can teach basic\ngeography, statistics and backstabbing skills;\nthe flash game Kitten Cannon is all about\nvectors and momentum. Plus - it almost goes\nwithout saying - games are more fun than the\nclassroom.\nAs in game design, there are different approaches taken by the architects of a scientific investigation. Some define their research\ntightly, aiming for specific, applied outcomes\n\u2013 like breaking down a building to knock out\na pig in Angry Birds. Other scientists take a\nmore open-ended, basic approach, following\ninteresting leads as they pop up \u2013 more like the\nshaping of a species in Spore.\nThen there\u2019s the metagame. Scientists can\u2019t\njust buy a lab off the shelf, stick it in a slot in\ntheir house and start doing science. They go\nthrough years of being newbies, rarely entrusted with difficult quests, shepherded by veteran\ngamers who coax them along with the promise\nof experience points but take the publication\ngold. As they go up through the levels of tertiary education, they start to build their own\nteam, their own stores of gold and items with\nwhich they can tackle bigger and harder prob-lems. If they solve something tough, they gain\nesteem in their peer community.\nLet\u2019s be realistic, though. In science, the\nrewards can be fewer and less intense than\ngames. That\u2019s because games are designed to\ncaptivate and entertain right from the start.\nSure, there might be hours of side games to get\ncoins or XP or the knack of the special move,\nbut at least there\u2019s still nice noises and colours\nto keep the brain occupied. Staring at Excel\nspreadsheets just doesn\u2019t have the same zing.\nNot only that, but if you complete a track on\nGuitar Hero on hard, you don\u2019t need to write\nit up in 3000 words only to have three or more\nstern peers criticise your performance before\ndeciding not to accept it, two months later.\nScience games, like protein-folding challenge\nFoldit, seek to tap into the fun of playing a\ngame, but are actually collecting real data and\ndeveloping real scientific skills.\nSo, next time you walk into the lab, try superimposing your favourite game world over\nit. It takes imagination, but it\u2019ll spice up your\nday. Just don\u2019t call your supervisor Illidan\nStormrage to his face, or accuse her of being\nMedusa and avoid her gaze. And if you change\nyour computer\u2019s settings to give you the Mario powerup noise every time you enter a cell\nof data, you\u2019ll be a lot happier. After all, your\njob is to play the biggest and most immersive\ngame in the world!\nLove video games? Then\nyou\u2019re a perfect scientist\nDavid Robertson explains how gamers explore and learn just like scientists\nWeb Games\nEach week we\u2019re going to bring you a selection of\nfresh, free and fun web games that you can play right\naway in your browser. Unless otherwise specified,\nyou\u2019re going to need the Adobe Flash Player plug-in\nwhich can be installed from http://get.adobe.com/\nflashplayer/.\nBurrito Bison\nnotdoppler.com/burritobison.php\nThis charming \u2018catapult-plus\u2019 game features our\ntitular character trapped in Candyland, home of the\ngummy bears, trying to escape his captors by bounc-ing, gliding and pogo-ing his way to freedom. The aim\nis simple: bounce on as many gummies as possible,\neventually blasting through the exit doors and out\ninto the real world.\nAlthough the repetitive launches get a bit tiresome\nlater on, things are kept fresh by plenty of \u2018special\npower\u2019 gummies and upgrades. There\u2019s a genuine\nchallenge in breaking through each zone\u2019s door, and\na sense of satisfaction when it\u2019s done for the first\ntime. Visuals are a real treat: the characters and environments look rich and colourful, and it\u2019s obvious\nthere\u2019s been plenty of attention to detail.\n...then Tekken must be like data entry: pointless, boring and a lot of button-mashing\nSo if Braid\u2019s time travel is the rocket science or brain surgery of the gaming world...\nAngry Birds\nchrome.angrybirds.com\nI played it once. Just once, on a friend\u2019s phone, but\nI was hooked. But then I was stuck - I didn\u2019t own a\nsmartphone. So, naturally, I had to buy a new Samsung Nebula S or something just so I could play it!\nDo you know what I found out when I got home? The\nmotherfriggers had gone and released a browser ver-sion. As long as I had an up-to-date copy of Chrome\nor Firefox, I could play it in my browser. What am I\nsupposed to do with my useless Galaxy S II now,\nhuh? Hot damn.\n\n"

There are fantastically named cocktails, like \u201cOrgasm\nplease!\u201d and \u201cBlow work\u201d, and tunes\nblasting from 11pm until 3am.\nThis is a place to have a drink to get\nsome rest after the endless hours of revision or just celebrate the end of ex-ams. During the \u2018Happy Hours\u2019 there\nare offers for house spirits from \u00a32.95,\nselected cocktail jugs from \u00a39.95 and\nHunger has taken me to many weird\nplaces \u2013 Zone 6, meat free foods and\neven Ginster\u2019s pasties. What I have\nnot done is eat a donkey\u2019s cock as Paul\nMerton almost did on his documentary\nseries about China. But if I were really\nhungry, would I?\nHaving ridden horses for a while, including a few stallions, I am confident\nthat the equine penis is pretty impossible to avoid noticing. Despite the donkey\u2019s reputation for pork swordsman-ship, equine vets inform me that that it\nis trumped by the tackle of your average Grand National winner. I cannot\nsay that that particular factoid makes\nme any keener to go near either geni-tal, let alone imbibe one should it rock\nup on my dinner plate\u2014however much\nprotein it might provide. But what about\nthe rest of the horse?\nIt is well known, if not well docu-mented, that the number of Exmoor ponies in South Devon was considerably\nsmaller after WWII than before it. As\nevery GCSE history student knows, rationing hit every food source hard, with\nmeat as no exception. But people were\nstill hungry and wanted to eat. And\nthere is a lot of meat on a horse. Even\na modestly-sized but properly-fed Exmoor pony will net over 100kg of meat.\nAs a large steak weighs about 0\u00b75kg, this\nrepresents a considerable supply of the\nred stuff. My father\u2019s family are from\nNorth Devon and so in order to survive the war healthily they probably ate\nhorsemeat. Even despite that, I am not\nthat keen. Sitting in a nice warm office\nwriting this, with a freezer of venison,\nduck, beef, chicken and fish at home I\nam not much being tested though.\nHowever there is an intellectual line\nR\neviews. I hate writing reviews for places that I\u2019ve\neaten \u2018on the house\u2019.\nThere\u2019s something about\ndining for free, and the\nawkward moment when you don\u2019t\ncall for the bill. Do you just thank\nthe waiter and bid him \u201cAdieu!\u201d? And\nwhen the restaurant gets my review\nin the post, I always wonder whether\nthey admire and put it amongst their\nother shiny reviews; or do they put\nyour name in the black book if you\nfoulmouthed the taste of their tap\nwater; or do they simply throw it in\nthe trash. The latter does seem far\nmore likely. (Especially when they\nsee the last sentence isn\u2019t even finished with a full stop.)\nI\u2019m not a fan of artistic blobs on\nthe plate to emulate fine dining. Just\nbecause three meagre drops of red\nberry jus are served on the side of a\nmelon starter does not make it look\nor taste any better. It\u2019s still 99p Galia\nmelon.\nI am a savoury person. Allow des-serts,sugar and sweets. It\u2019s a matter\nof variety more than anything: think\nof the wonderful world of cheese,\nthe oh-so-tasty steaks, the freshly\nbaked pastries and breads; pasta,\nfish \u2019n\u2019 chips, fried artichokes! Although, saying that, I don\u2019t settle for\nanything less than a Pierre Herm\u00e9\nmacaron. Paul, Ladur\u00e9e, nada. Making these almond delights at home\nhave always resulted in baking paper studded with sticky, sugar blobs,\nso I ask, why waste time when I can\ntaste perfection from the artisan of\nLe Macaron himself. People who\nthink Ladur\u00e9e is some kind of luxury\u2026 man, are you oblivious. (And it\u2019s\nnot two \u201co\u201ds, but one. If you were\na true macaronolic, you would know\nthe difference.)\nI can\u2019t cook as well as people\nwould expect. I am a self-confessed\nfoodie, which means I have an affinity to good food. It doesn\u2019t mean I\ncan cook (well). What were restaurants made for, eh?\nAnd yes you hate me because I\u2019m\nthe person that makes you wait until\nthe food goes cold, whilst I take a\ngazillion photos on my dSLR. And?\nAnd finally, being food editor this\nyear, boy was that hard. Having free\nmeals to distribute, being sent a\ncookery book here and there, maybe just get a free ticket occasion-ally. But no, seriously, with students\u2019\nmeal habits ranging from a baguette\nfrom The Sandwich Shop to a meal\nin Heston Blumenthal\u2019s \u2018Dinner\u2019the middle ground sure is No Man\u2019s\nLand.

If you visit the place on Tuesday\nor Wednsday you\u2019ll find yourself in a\n\u2018Wicked Student Night\u2019 with student\ndrinks deals all night, but there\u2019s also\nfree entry for girls on Thursday.\nThe bar is open Tuesday\u2013Saturday,\nBy Dana Li\nthat I make. Horses are working ani-mals. I do not use them as such, but I\ndo not use cats or dogs in their working capacity either: and neither do I eat\nthem And it is clear that those animals\nare not stock animals anywhere in the\nwestern world. What is equally clear\nis that cows, chickens and duck are not\nworking animals anywhere in the western world either. They are stock animals\nthat are bred (or shot) for meat. At no\npoint are they working animals. This\nmakes a nice distinction between the\ntwo types \u2013 animals bred and reared for\nmeat, and animals that are not.\nflickr/publicenergy\nSamuel Furse\nBut there was one I could not put\nin the list \u2013 pigs. Although they are not\nthought of as working animals, ethically\nI know they are not only used as stock\nanimals in western Europe so I could\nnot put them in the list above. One reason is that they are used to find truffles\non the continent. More recently, heart\nvalves from pigs have been used to treat\nheart disease in humans. If you had had\na replacement heart valve from a pig,\nwould you feel the same about eating\na Cumberland sausage afterwards? It\nmight be a bit close to the bone for me.\nSo unless I make a subtle and rather\nlame extension to the differentiation\nbetween the sort of meat I do and do\nnot eat, that means it is alright for me\nto eat pigs (or not), I am cut off from\nany sort of moral imperative behind my\nchoice of foodstuff. I now wonder why\nI or anyone else makes a distinction between which meats to eat and which not\non intellectual or moral grounds at all.\nWhat could that possibly achieve? All it\ndoes it lend a certain lofty high ground\nto a combination of personal prefer-ence, practicality, dated hygiene considerations and availability. And what\nis wrong with those as reasons anyway?\nAi Chihuahua!\nAnastasia Eleftheriou pays a visit to Los Locos\n5pm\u20133am, and the restaurant is open\nTuesday\u2013Saturday, 5\u201311pm.

    "content": "The annual artistic extravaganza returns to draw the\ncrowds to the Royal Academy for a mixed bag of works\nFELIX\n20\nPoems for the Week\nARTS\nArts Editor: Rox Middleton\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFriday 24 JUNE 2011\nTo Summer\nby William Blake\nOver the past three terms, I\u2019ve made a habit of\nsitting on the fence when it comes to review-ing. I\u2019ve never known quite why we don\u2019t include ratings in the Arts section, but I suspect\nit might be due to the fact that it would just be\na constant stream of three star reviews. Having said this, I wouldn\u2019t give the RA Summer\nExhibition three stars. Well, at least some bits\nof it. Christ, other bits I wouldn\u2019t even care to\ndeign with attention. This, dear reader, is the\nSummer Exhibition dilemma.\nI struggle to think of anything, like, anything at all, that changes and renews itself on\na regular basis and yet consistently succeeds\nin making the grade as the Summer Exhibition\ndoes. Take its distant cousin, the Summer Ball\n\u2013 2010 offered Tinie Tempah, 2011 brought\nwith it Ian Brown. The decline is so steep that\none could easily be lead into thinking that the\nBeatles had reformed just to play in 2009. Any\nDPFS could learn a thing or two from the annual exhibition of the work of the students of\nthe Royal Academy.\nLike I said before, the exhibition isn\u2019t wall-to-wall stunners. Anthony Green\u2019s small crop\nof postcard, pastoral scenes appeared to be\npainted on the theme of Beryl Cook with a\nheadache. Surrounded by chocolate boxey\noil paintings, the collection had echoes of\nLabrinth grinding out a set in the rain with everybody else, ironically in retrospect, waiting\nfor him to play \u201cLet the Sun Shine\u201d. The nature\nof the Exhibition is that the vast majority of\npieces are for sale, and despite the fact that I\ndoubt many semi-blind cave dwellers visit the\nexhibition on the hunt for a painting of an old\nman and a dog decorating a nude woman in a\nfield, I suspect someone will buy it. Possibly\nalong with a copy of Stooshe\u2019s new single, the\ntender love ballad \u2018Fuck Me.\u2019\nJust as one man\u2019s Chase and Status is another man\u2019s Chew Lips, it\u2019s not hard to stroll,\nnose aloft, past into the more edgy corners of\nthe Exhibition and find something to one\u2019s\ntaste. Early on in the exhibition, one encounters Keith Tyson\u2019s Deep Impact. A huge piece,\neight metres square, depicting a maelstrom of\nswirling, foreboding darkness, topped of with\na name that sounds like a low-grade porn film.\nIt washes the beholder in a charging anger that\nwith every glance throws up before unnoticed\ndetails, all contained in a smooth, almost cold\nslab. A feat of practical creation as much as\nconceptual, the skill in its crafting is belied\nas the guide lists it as being made of \u2018mixed\nmedia\u2019.\nDifferent rooms are given over to different\ncurators, each of whom bring unique flavours\nto each room. Prints this year have a greater\npresence, afforded more walls in the exhibition and not as crammed as has been the case\nin bygone years and water colours are making\nan unwelcome resurgence, death by pastel colours is apparently in vogue. Head and shoulders above the rest stands Michael Sandle\u2019s\ncollection on the horrors of war. The pieces are\ndisplayed with a strange air of memorabilia to\nthem and mix silent, portentous sculpture with\npieces made of scatty splinters of emotion. Tim\nShaw\u2019s sculpture of a man in flames, running,\nstands as a poignant testament to the horrors of\nwar, with the painful directness that the more\nsolemn pieces lack.\nUntil 15th August at the Royal Academy\nHave a Ball at the RA\u2019s\nSummer Exhibition\nWill Prince\nDeep Impact: Keith Tyson\n\u201cHead and shoulders\nabove the rest stands\nMichael Sandle\u2019s\ncollection on the horrors\nof war\u201d\nO thou who passest thro\u2019 our valleys in\nThy strength, curb thy fierce steeds, allay the heat\nThat flames from their large nostrils! thou, O Summer,\nOft pitched\u2019st here thy goldent tent, and oft\nBeneath our oaks hast slept, while we beheld\nWith joy thy ruddy limbs and flourishing hair.\nBeneath our thickest shades we oft have heard\nThy voice, when noon upon his fervid car\nRode o\u2019er the deep of heaven; beside our springs\nSit down, and in our mossy valleys, on\nSome bank beside a river clear, throw thy\nSilk draperies off, and rush into the stream:\nOur valleys love the Summer in his pride.\nOur bards are fam\u2019d who strike the silver wire:\nOur youth are bolder than the southern swains:\nOur maidens fairer in the sprightly dance:\nWe lack not songs, nor instruments of joy,\nNor echoes sweet, nor waters clear as heaven,\nNor laurel wreaths against the sultry heat.\nImagine this but 4mx2m.

Companies across the web have been striving to find a\nmodel for digital currency that works. From Facebook\nto Farmville; World of Warcraft to Second Life people\nare buying currency that is used online even though\nit has no physical manifestation. Stranger still, people are willing to accept payments for goods and services in the real world using these virtual currencies.\nIn 2009, Satoshi Nakamoto, a Japanese cryptography expert created the world\u00eds first decentralised\ndigital currency and Bitcoin was born.\nNow this sort of economic alchemy has been done\nbefore. All modern day government-backed currencies are fiat: their value is not tied to anything physi-cal. But unlike conventional currency, Bitcoin (BTC)\nhas no centralized issuing or holding authority. Its\nproduction is hardcoded into the software itself and\ncannot be altered. Only market forces control its val-ue. So what benefits does this offer compared with\nthe tried and tested British Pound Sterling?\nTransfers are conducted from peer to peer and are\ncertified by the network itself so there is no need for\nbanks or other third parties, resulting in almost no\ntransaction fees. Your account can\u2019t be frozen, even\nby the founders of Bitcoin, so you have complete liquidity and freedom to spend your money irrespective of external forces. This is extremely valuable to\npeople who keep large amounts of money on-line in\naccounts at companies such as Paypal. Earlier this\nyear the US government froze hundreds of millions\nof dollars in online poker accounts leaving thousands of people without access to over 80% of their\nnet value, something that would be impossible using\nthis new currency.\nThere are still a lot of kinks that need to be ironed\nout. Last week $500,000 worth of BTC were stolen,\ncausing the currency\u2019s market value to crash from\n$20 per 1BTC to just $0.01 per 1BTC. However, it\nhas subsequently bounced back. Furthermore, the\nanonymity that the system affords attracts a black\nmarket where people buy and sell contraband such\ndrugs, weapons and stolen personal information so\ngovernments are becoming increasingly weary of\nthis uncontrollable marketplace. Right now you can\nonly use Bitcoins to buy niche tech products and services and gimmicky alpaca socks.\nHowever, if major retailers start taking virtual currency seriously it could revolutionize our perspective\non money, doing for finance what the internet did for\npublishing, ownership and transfers. Adam Labi\nA\ns summer draws nearer and the\nspring round of exhibitions and\ntrade fairs draws to a close,\nthere\u2019s a lot of shiny new technology to look forward to over\nthe next few months. Driving the latest round of\nproducts is the incessant slide towards perpetual\nconnectivity: be it mobile, tablet, laptop or the\nincreasingly elusive desktop, all major tech\nplayers are pushing to have you wired 24/7.\nNFC and mobile wallets\nThe most noticeable push this summer will lie\nin NFC and the possibilities it opens up for\nmobile wallets. To the uninitiated, NFC chips\nare a close relative to the RFID chips that you\nhave in your student and Oyster cards. The\nnew NFC technology that is being championed by telecom operators and device manufacturers alike will allow your phone to read\nand write data to sensors and other phones by\ntouch alone.\nThe applications for the technology are very\npromising. Tapping two phones together could\ntransfer a song between friends, or connect\nthem on Facebook. The real money will lie in\nmobile wallets, however. The concept of using your phone as a wallet (tap-to-pay on special till sensors) has been floated for at least\na decade and has made some inroads in the\nFar East, but hasn\u2019t kicked off in earnest yet.\nThis is all set to change in the next few weeks,\nas card companies, phone manufacturers and\nline operators are all jockeying frantically for\na slice of what might be a huge revenue pie.\nOrange\u2019s Samsung QuickTap handset has already been introduced in the UK, and the three\nmajor mobile operators in the UK (Everything\nEverywhere, Telefonica and Vodafone) have\njust announced a move to form a mobile payment joint venture that will bring widespread\ncoverage \u2018before the end of the year\u2019. With\nGoogle Wallet also promising similar functionality in the near future, the death of cash-points may be within sight.\nLocation, location, location\nGPS on phones has been available for some\ntime now, but it has taken a while for most\nbusinesses to cotton on to the potential of\nknowing exactly where your user is. While\nservices that depend on location often tread\nthe fine line between creepy and useful, there\u2019s\nsomething to be said for the wealth of location-based discount services mushrooming on social networking sites. Check-in, publicise the\nrestaurant, receive a coupon and everyone\u2019s\nhappy. It\u2019s not everyone\u2019s cup of tea, but on a\nstudent budget, I\u2019m not complaining.\nTake your stuff with you\nThe potential of the \u2018cloud\u2019 has been trumpeted by the media for the last few years now,\nbut there has been a stark absence of many\nreal cloud products beyond data backup and\nGoogle docs. If the last few months are any\nindication, however, 2011 is poised to be the\nyear where you\u2019ll never have to worry about\nleaving home without your books, music or\nvideos.\nAmazon, Google, Apple and Spotify all\nhave huge plans for your music library - their\nservices will all give you varying degrees\nof access to your songs across your devices.\nSpotify\u2019s services have been up and running\nin the UK for a while now, and the others are\nsupposed to roll out from late 2011 onwards.\nAlong with the Kindle\u2019s cross-platform books\nservice and rumours of a launch for streaming\nmovie provider Netflix, there will soon be no\nbarrier to carrying your media with you wherever you go.\nThe summer will also see the launch of\nGoogle\u2019s Chromebooks in the UK. A radical\nre-envisioning of what a laptop should look\nlike, the system only comes bundled with what\nis essentially a browser. In future, you will be\nable to find all the software you need through\ntheir online apps. It\u2019s a bold move, and there\u2019s\nno telling how far it will go just yet, but if\nyou\u2019re buying into the cloud philosophy and\nwant a basic computer on the cheap, this will\nprobably be worth having a look at.\nFinally, a free lunch?\nThe implications of all this innovation are\nhuge. On the one hand there are the positive\nconsequences: we will see people finally being\nable to exchange media seamlessly by tapping\nphones together, while physical money is making it\u2019s inexorable decline into obsolescence.\nDevices around us are becoming smarter and\nincreasingly interconnected every day: integrating chips into almost everything we own is\nbecoming an expectation rather than a luxury.\nAs always, freedom comes at a price. Ubiquitous computing has been driven in part by\na system of barter in a 21st century context:\nyour personal information in exchange for\na service. This has worked brilliantly so far:\nswapping some personal information for targeted advertising is a price that most of us are\nwilling to pay. Yet technology companies are\nconstantly redrawing the boundaries, and for\nthe first time the, dynamic is shifting away\nfrom users choosing to upload their data and\ntowards devices constantly collecting data\nfrom your palm as you travel, spend money\nand make friends.\nIf nothing else, it\u2019s always worth remembering that anything you put out there on the\ninternet will always remain on some server,\nowned by a company that you have no control over. Facebook, Twitter and Google have\nus wrapped around an innocuous finger of free\nservices and constant connectivity. The onset\nof ubiquitous computing might take nothing\nfrom your pocket, but will drop these companies into your life forever. As gloomy a prophecy as that may seem, the information is only\nthere if you choose to give it to them. So if you\ndo choose to tap-to-pay using NFC or coupon\nyour way around town with foursquare, always\nremember the hidden price you are paying for\nthe service. Have a great summer!\n\u2018Everything everywhere\u2019 a reality?\nFeroz Salam picks out the top tech debuting this summer\n\n"

    "content": "4 FELIX\nNEWS\nFriday 24 june 2011\nFEATURE\nIf you think the grass might be\ngreener on the other side of the\npond, here\u2019s what you need to know\nto apply for a PhD at US universities.\nGenerally, graduate studies in the\nUnited States take five years. This\nseems like a long time compared\nto the three years of a PhD in the\nUK. However, the first year of the US\nPhD is equivalent to the one year\nMasters of Science courses in the\nUK, which means that the effective\ntime you spend doing PhD research\nis only a year longer than its UK\ncounterpart. If you are considering\nan academic career this extra year\nmight give you a crucial advantage\nwhen competing for postdoc posi-tions. As a PhD student you often\nhave the most productive phase in\nyour third and fourth years.\nDuring your first year of graduate\nstudies you will do a Masters de-gree. Hence it is most convenient to\ncontinue in the US after your three\nyear BSc course at Imperial College.\nHowever, a Masters in your pocket\nwill not weigh you down. While you\nstill have to take the so called qualifying examinations for the US Masters, the courses will often be very\nsimilar to the ones you have already\ndone and you won\u2019t need to do them\nagain, which leaves time for research in your first year. If there is a\nconsiderable overlap, you might be\nable to do the qualifying exams at\nthe beginning of your graduate studies and obtain the US masters after a few weeks in graduate school.\nSome universities even offer an initial \u2018free shot\u2019 at these exams.\nSo how do you get in? There is no\ncentral application system like UCAS\nand there are typically no interviews,\nwhich might be a relief for some of\nyou given the track record of the average Imperial Student at Oxbridge\ninterviews. An application to US universities has three components: a\nstatement of purpose, GRE exams\nand letters of recommendation.\nThe statement of purpose is much\nlike your personal statement, where\nyou elaborate on your motivations,\nexperience and research interests.\nThe GRE exams are like the SATs for\nNews Editors: Matt Colvin\nAlex Karapetian\nnews.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nThe American Dream\nGraduate studies in the USA\ngraduate students and are divided\ninto a general GRE and a subject\nGRE. The general GRE consists of\nthree sections that test your verbal,\nquantitative and writing skills. To\nsee which scores will get you into\nwhich grad school you can check\nthe university website and the www.\ngradcafe.com. You can book the\nexam up to two weeks before you\nplan to take it. You can even resit\nthe exam, but be aware that the\nscore report will show all your at-tempts. For PhDs where the subject\nGRE is a prerequisite, it is a crucial\ncomponent of your application. It\ntests the knowledge of your subject\nat undergraduate level with 60-100\nmultiple choice questions that you\nhave to answer in almost 3 hours.\nNote that you should start preparation at the end of the summer between second and third year (third\nand fourth year for MSci students),\nbecause you can sit the exam at\nonly one date in November. It is difficult to prepare properly during the\nfirst term. Letters of recommendation are very important and should\nbe written by someone who knows\nyou very well and ideally who is also\nknown by many other researchers in\nyour favourite field of research.\nFunding is often a deal breaker for\nmost students considering a PhD\nin the US. Don\u2019t be discouraged.\nFirstly, admission officers know that\nstudents are financially challenged\nand often enter graduate school with\na considerable debt. For the record,\nUS undergraduates pay between\n$30,000 and $50,000 annually\nthroughout their 4-year Bachelor. You\nwill be surprised to find that universities compete for you with lucrative\nscholarships. The financial package\nattached to your offer of admission\nwill obviously be greater the stronger your application is. This often\ncovers your tuition fees for the first\nyear (roughly $35,000) and you can\nalways do a Teaching Assistantship\n(TA), where you work between 5 and\n20 hours a week for 9 months and\nearn a salary of $18,000. During\nthe remaining years you will attend\nfew classes and hence will only pay\na small tuition fee. Additionally, you\nwill have the opportunity to work as\na \u2018graduate research assistant\u2019. This\nmeans you can assist your supervisor and do research contributing\nto your PhD for an annual salary of\n$19,000. Hence you are in the blissful situation where you get paid for\nresearch that you would do anyway.\nIt\u2019s almost too good to be true.\nTom Neiser\nRegistration chaos for\nBusiness School courses\nThe registration system for optional\ncourse modules in Business In Science,\nEngineering & Technology (BEST) was\nhit with problems on Monday. The Departmental Student System (DSS) used\nfor registering optional modules in\ncourses across college was swamped\nwith connection requests as students\nlogged on to pick their chosen modules\nin the morning.\nThe registration system is handled on\na first come first served basis and registration was due to open at 9:00am on\nMonday morning. Since a substantial\nnumber of connection requests were\nmade by students trying to use the\nsystem concurrently, it appeared to be\ndown as the connections were slowly\nhandled. One student from the Department of Computing complained that\nby the time they gained access to view\nthe system at 9:10am, all courses with\nthe exception of two were already full,\nwith one option from the previous year\nshown in error.\nStudents complained of the system\u2019s\nfaults especially at such a critical time\nas registration and many were left\nwithout their preferred options. Tony\nField, reader in Performance Engineering at the Department of Computing,\ncommented in an email that the system\nin place was \u201ca new piece of software\u201d\nand that \u201cwe can safely conclude it\ndoesn\u2019t work\u201d, noting the lessons to be\nlearnt regarding testing quality of ser-vice, performance and other requirements in forward-facing systems for\nstudents and staff alike.\nQuestions have been raised as to\nwhether the problems ought to have\nbeen prevented due to its foreseeable\nnature and how these issues will be\naddressed. A number of students have\nalso complained about the timing of the\nopening of registration. Exams are still\nongoing across campus, and a 9:00am\nopening time may not be optimal. Students also may not know their timetables for the coming year and may end\nup dropping options they register for\ndue to clashes with compulsory mod-ules. In addition, third year students,\nnotably in the Department of Computing, are on industrial placements and\nare unable to check the system until a\ndesignated break.\nThe issue of each student having an\nequal opportunity to take these courses\nhas been raised, and Undergraduate\nProgrammes Manager Edina HamzicMaguire commented that the faculty\nare \u201caware that the system is not perfect and [they] are reviewing it.\u201d Colin Love, Director of Undergraduate\nStudies explained to Felix that they\n\u201cteach some 2200 students a year on\nBEST courses and demand for places\noutstrips supply by three times on average.\u201d\nDerryck Stewart of the Department\nof Physics apologised to their undergraduates and explained that \u201csome\nplaces on some courses have now been\nreserved for Physics students\u201d, raising\nmore questions regarding equal oppor-tunities. Hamzic-Maguire went on to\nmention that \u201csome departments have\nintegrated these modules into their programmes and those have had a chance\nto pre book spaces.\u201d\nColin Love explained that \u201cthe DSS\n\u201cThere\u2019s no central\napplication system\nlike UCAS\u201d\nsystem [they] are using this year is not\nowned by the Business School so the\nwebsite capabilities are out of [their]\ncontrol\u201d and continued to mention that\nhe understands \u201cthe first come first\nserved allocation of places is not perfect but in the absence of a better system [they] made no changes this year.\u201d\nRegarding reserved places, he said\nthat \u201cdepartments were contacted in\nMay and invited to hold some places\nfor their students\u201d and that the allocation \u201cis earmarked for particular courses but not for individual students.\u201d He\nexplained \u201cwhere actual demand from\na department exceeds the reserved\nplaces their students have to compete\nfor places alongside everyone else.\u201d\nAddressing the earlier complaint of\nthe options not all being available in\nthe morning, he said \u201cthe system crash\ncaused this also as the production team\ncould not log in to activate all the options\u201d.\n\u201cWe have done whatever we could\nin the run up to today to liaise with\ndepartments and ensure most students\nhave a fair chance of registering on\nthese extremely popular courses\u201d. By\n10:00am on Monday over 60% of the\nBEST course places had been allocat-ed. The Business School online page\nlinking to DSS noted that the technical\ndifficulties were resolved at 9:40am.\n\u201cWe are delighted to say that by midday on Monday all 2200 places were\nallocated and we look forward to welcoming those students to BEST classes\nfrom October.\u201d\nAlex Karapetian\nThe Union has publicly condemned the\nbehavior of large academic journal publishing companies, claiming that their\nservices are detrimental not only to Imperial, but to the Higher Education sector in general.\nCurrently, about 50% of Imperial College Library\u2019s budget is spent on jour-nals, which are either provided on an individual basis or as part of a larger deal\nthrough a publishing company, which\ninstead allows staff and students access\nto thousands of academic references.\nAt the most recent Union Council\nUnion supports journal subscriptions campaign\nmeeting, which took place on the 13th\nJune, a policy was passed outlining the\nUnion\u2019s dissatisfaction against publishing companies, with specific reference and heavy criticism made towards\nthe journal pricing of Elsevier and Wiley-Blackwell.\nIn a note brought to the Council\nmeeting by Deputy President (Educa-tion) Alex Dahinten, mention is made\nof publishing companies being \u201caware\nof the need for their product, which is\nreflected in the pricing,\u201d moving on to\nexplain that subscription prices rise by\nabout 6% per year.\nDahinten argued that over-priced\njournal subscriptions are compromising the Library\u2019s ability to provide a\nservice to academics and students at\nImperial.\nDirector of Library Services Deborah\nShorley is supportive of the Union\u2019s\nposition on the matter, remarking that\nthe Library is \u201cvery grateful to [the\nUnion] for its support.\u201d\n\u201cWe are determined to do all we can\nto safeguard access to the information\nresources. Our students and researchers\nneed to do their work but we don\u2019t underestimate the task ahead of us so it\u2019s\ngreat to know that the Imperial student\nbody is right behind us.\u201d\nMatt Colvin\nComplaints after high demand\nbrings down registration system\n\n"

Kings of Indiedom Arcade Fire present\na huge, festival-sized performance in Hyde Park,\nalongside the fantastic Beirut, in their biggest UK\nshow ever. You\u2019ll be sure to hear songs from their\nrecent third album The Suburbs, as well as fan favourites from the fantastic Funeral. On the down-side, you\u2019ll have to bring earplugs since you\u2019ll need\nto put up with support from faux-folk yawn-inducers\nMumford & Sons, as well as awful punk-revivalists\nThe Vaccines, but you can take that opportunity to\nget dinner. The best part of the evening, however,\ncomes right at the beginning when brilliant Canadian violinist Owen Pallett (formerly Final Fantasy)\nplays his half-hour set. Make sure you buy your\ntickets quickly, because this promises to be the\nbiggest gig for many many months. Stephen Smith\nWith ukelele workshops, a pop-up planetarium and The Go! Team in attend-ance, Stephen Smith can\u2019t wait for this year\u2019s astro-themed Deer Shed festival\nGlorious Glastonbury\ndy corner somewhere.\nGlastonbury is totally unique amongst festi-vals, a throwback to the \u201860s and \u201870s when\nthe events were about more than the music and\ninstead became a cultural force in their own\nright. Glasto has retained at least of that spirit,\ndespite its vast security fence and slick corporate PR, making it the only major festival in\nthe country where you stand a greater risk of\nmaking a fool of yourself country dancing with\nthe Wurzels than you do of being compelled\nto listen to the latest round of identikit beige\npopsters while being force-fed Virgin cola.\nFor all the tabloid headlines, you can tell your\nMum it\u2019s safer than London \u2013 you might get\nmugged for your ice cream by a man dressed\nas a seagull, but your stuff\u2019s pretty much sacrosanct \u2013 so long as it\u2019s waterproof. No matter how gloriously sunny the Spring may have\nbeen, one thing you can rely upon is that it will\nrain for Glastonbury, and the weather gods will\npour their wrath upon the uncaring hordes and\nturn the valley into a scale model of the Somme. We won\u2019t care. I\u2019ll see you at the front.\nW\nriting about music quickly\nmakes you cynical about\ndull and repetitive festivals\nall over the country, all\nplaying boring music and\nall with the same sex, drugs and rock \u2018n\u2019 roll\nattitude. But occasionally there comes along a\nfestival so perfectly concieved that you can\u2019t\nquite believe that it\u2019s real. The Deer Shed Festival is a perfect example.\nThis year\u2019s festival is headlined by superb\nalt-rock outfit I Am Kloot, whose recent album The Sky At Night gives rise to this year\u2019s\nfestival theme: astronomy. On Saturday night,\na group of professional astronomers will lead\nfestival-goers on a star-gazing trip, with telescopes and binoculars provided of course.\nWhen not staring at the stars, you will be\nasked to make a small plasticine alien to place\non the papier-mache moonscape for an epic\nstop-motion film, and once you\u2019ve done that\nyou\u2019ll be able to make an alien mask out of\nmilk bottles. And all this while bouncing\naround the fields on a free space hopper.\nFriday night sees an unnamed Russian cosmonaut hosting an evening of comedy and\ncabaret, and afterwards, he\u2019ll be helping to\nsend a mysterious object space-bound.\nIf all the astronomy gets too much, you can\nalways retreat into the wonderful music on\noffer, including the fantastic Go! Team, the\nbeautiful Leisure Society and the always fascinating Erland and the Carnival. Deer Shed\nreally is a science student\u2019s dream.\nSadly, Brian won\u2019t be able to make it to this year\u2019s Deer Shed Festival, but don\u2019t\nworry, there will be plenty of real physicists and astronomers there, and Colin Firth\nAs the UK\u2019s most famous festival gets underway, Duncan Casey tells us\nwhat awaits the lucky few with tickets\nBon Iver\nBon Iver\n4AD\n2011\nThis year\u2019s Glasto line-up is sufficient to send\na tingle up the spine of even the most jaded\nfestival veteran.

    "content": "FELIX Friday 24 june 2011 19\nCOMMENT\nI\n\u2019m not one for blowing my own\ntrumpet, but sometimes when\nI look down on this sprawling\nmetropolis of science and soccer,\nof museums and Metro newspa-pers, I think we can feel a modicum of\npride. I\u2019m not talking about just London\nthough. It\u2019s everyone, the whole human\nrace! When I think about what we\u2019ve\nachieved, I have to say that humanity\u2019s\npretty great.\nAnd how did we find ourselves in this\nmost envious position? Was it through\nstrength? Um, no, we\u2019re actually pretty\nweedy, especially compared to our distant cousins, the gorillas. They could\neasily rip your whole arm off. If species success was measured on strength\nalone, we\u2019d barely get an honourable\nmention. But in reality, we are gracious\nwinners. It\u2019s good to see more and more\ngorillas finding employment as club\nbouncers.\nWell, maybe it was our flighty feet that\ngave us the evolutionary edge? Again,\nnot so. Humanity is the asthmatic kid of\nevolution, always getting picked last for\nP.E. \u2013 we\u2019re not even in the same league\nas the likes of the leopard.\nSimon\nWorthington\nRhys Davies\nLiving up to election promises\n\u201cIt\u2019s good to see\nmore and more\ngorillas finding\nemployment as club\nbouncers\u201d\nApat on the back for humanity\n\u201cThe question I\u2019m\nasking is \u2013 did they\nmake the difference\nthat they promised?\u201d\nleave a legacy in a language written in\nmore than just A, G, C and T.\nBut our minds have a dark side also.\nWith such a grand capacity to think, we\nare so vulnerable to over-thinking. We\ncan take one event, one comment, and\ntorture ourselves over its most absurd\ninterpretations. This is the price for our\nmental agility; Mr Hyde to our otherwise fantastic Dr Jekyll.\nAnd even when we\u2019re thinking\nstraight, our minds can be our sternest critics. We set impossible standards\n\u2013 the only ones worth reaching for \u2013\nand crucify ourselves when we fail to\nreach them. We could be the brightest\nspark, but if we can\u2019t please ourselves,\nthen everything else is worthless. The\nreverse can be just as true; sickening\nsycophancy only builds up illusions of\ngreatness.\nBut these are just blemishes on what\nis truly a beautiful mind. I am willing\nto pay in psychosis and neurosis for all\nwe have gained, and have yet to gain,\nfrom this brilliant collection of electrical impulses and ion imbalances. Could\na flagellar motor do that?\nThink about it!\nBut there isn\u2019t a secret order of leopard high elders controlling the sum of\nworld politics behind the scenes (prob-ably). How come? It is because, though\nwe are not the fastest or the strongest,\nwe are the smartest. From a little clump\nof tapioca-mush in our heads spring all\nof humanity\u2019s achievements. This is\nwhy I think we\u2019re pretty groovy; the entire sum of art, philosophy and science\nhas arisen from a few thousand years of\nsemi-random electrical discharges.\nSoaking up mankind\u2019s finest endeav-ours, I can almost forget that we\u2019re little\nmore than complex, over-complicated\nmachines for replicating lengths of a\nsugar-base polymer.\nIt can be a bit of a downer to think that\npurpose of life is just to beget more life\n\u2013 no matter how fun the process may\nbe. But then I realised, because E=mc2\nand Michaelangelo\u2019s David have no\nimpact on passing on the genome, they\nare more significant, not less. Einstein,\nMonet, Nietzsche, Newton, Descartes.\nUndeniably great men but where are\ntheir children now? It is the fruit of our\nminds, not of our loins that allow us to\nachieve immortality. They allow us to\nI\nwant it to be the year where your\nUnion makes a Guinness World\nRecord attempt.\u201d \u201cVote for me\nfor better quality lecture notes.\u201d\nSorry, what? Can you say that\nagain, please? I think my brain might\nbe haemorrhaging. I was expecting to\nhear some realistic, sensible proposals\ncoming out of your mouth, but instead\nall I\u2019m registering is a massive pile of\ncrap. If you haven\u2019t got it already, those\nphrases up there are all extracts pulled\ndirectly from the manifestos of next\nyear\u2019s Sabbatical officers.\nJust look at them. What do they even\nmean? They\u2019re either so vague and woolly as to be pretty much meaningless, or\nelse they\u2019re so badly thought out that\nthey\u2019re unfeasible in practice. People\npromise stupid things \u2013 one candidate\npromised to campaign for a \u201cfreeze on\nfees for international students.\u201d Seriously, what position do people think they\u2019re\nrunning for? \u2013 Rector? If not, then this\n\u2018campaign\u2019 is pretty much futile \u2013 I\u2019d\nlike to see a Union Sabb forcing the\ncollege out of hundreds of thousands of\npounds a year in the name of some ideal.\nFor many candidates, their manifesto\nis just a big pack of lies \u2013 stuff they just\ncame up with to get your vote. I hold\nthe (somewhat cynical) view that many\ncandidates have no intention of keeping any of their election promises because they know once they\u2019re in power,\nthey can do pretty much whatever the\nhell they like. After their year of \u2018representing our views\u2019, they walk out the\ndoor and disappear. I\u2019m not saying the\nelected officers don\u2019t make a difference\n\u2013 anyone remotely involved with the\nUnion knows that they do. The question I\u2019m asking is \u2013 did they make the\ndifference that they promised?\nThe short answer is that no-one\nknows, or, at least, no-one bothers to\ncheck. Once the year is done and dust-ed, no-one looks at whether the elected\nofficers achieved what they promised us\nthey would, or whether they sat on their\nthumbs all year.\nWhat all this leads to is a system\nwhere candidates can say one set of\nthings in their manifestos and then,\nupon election, act completely different-ly. This renders the whole democratic\nprocess meaningless \u2013 if we can\u2019t rely\non what candidates say they\u2019ll do, how\ndo you choose who to vote for?\nClearly then, it is important that the\nelected officers are held to account if we\nwant to bother with this whole voting\nbusiness. Felix doesn\u2019t enjoy covering\nit, because stories about Union politics\nare boring and the majority of students\ncouldn\u2019t give a toss anyway, so without\nthe voters themselves to dole out the\npunishment, who else is left? Thankfully, there\u2019s the Union Council.\nUnion Council voted last week to deny\nthe current Deputy President (Finance\nand Services) an Honorary Life Membership of the Union, an accolade that\nwas given to the five other Sabbs. The\ndecision was quashed by Court because\nthe voting procedure was unconstitutional and it still hasn\u2019t been fully re-solved, but I\u2019m glad that Council did it.\nThis isn\u2019t a poke at the DPFS himself \u2013 I\ndon\u2019t know anything about his job and I\ndon\u2019t know whether his performance deserved such a ruling \u2013 I\u2019m just glad that\nthe Union Council actually has the balls\nto deny an elected officer such an award\nif they think that it isn\u2019t deserved.\nIt means that someone is holding\npeople to account, and is smacking them\ndown if they\u2019ve done a bad job.Although\nit\u2019s a tiny decision in the grand scheme\nof things, it shows that their heart is in\nthe right place. If elected officers are\nfinally being held to account for their\nperformance in office, it means that we\nmight actually be starting to move away\nfrom a culture of nonsense manifesto\npoints and Sabbaticals who can do what\nthey want. Ultimately, that\u2019ll lead to a\nmore meaningful election process and,\ntherefore, a better Union for everyone.\nA\nndy Murray may have\nmade his name as\na great British and\nmediocre international tennis player\nbut when it comes to fending\noff burglars (otherwise known\nas false alarms) he really\nought to leave it to the pros.\nKim Sears, his girlfriend,\nquestions Murray\u2019s decision\nto defend her honour with a\ntennis racket...\nMurray: I was just lying in\nbed when I realised that there\nwas a burglar trying to attack my girlfriend. My racket\nwas obviously my weapon of\nchoice. Haven\u2019t you seen what\nI can do with that thing?\nKim: No way is a racket any\nuse against a burglar. What\nwere you thinking Andy?\nMurray: I was thinking I\u2019d\ncatch him off guard with a\ngood smash, rather than my\nsignature dropshot that I always use even though Rafa\nand Roger can reach it, no\nproblem.\nKim: First it was all that Playstation and now it\u2019s tennis.\nI\u2019ve had enough of your frolick-ing. You say it\u2019s your life but\nwhen you gonna win one of the\nbig tournaments?\nMurray: That\u2019s not what you\nwere saying last night, remem-ber? About how you were going to give me my first grand\nslam? That was the whole reason my racket was in bed in\nthe first place!\nKim: Yeah, well what applies\nin role-play doesn\u2019t apply IRL.\nFor example, last night I was\nactually picturing your big bro.\nMurray: What!? I\u2019m defo superior to Jamie.\nKim: Well, at least he\u2019s won\nWimbledon.\nMurray: But that was only\ndoubles - I work alone baby.\nAnd it was MIXED doubles at\nthat!

The clearing of the\nminefields were agreed upon as part of the peace\nagreement with the Maoist rebels who now form\npart of the Nepali Government. Despite the clearing\nof the minefields, Nepal however still faces many\nchallenges ahead including how to demobilise the\n19,000 former Maoist soldiers.\nNepal\nThe People\u2019s Republic of China has said that it\nwould abstain from using force to solve maritime\ndisputes in the South China Sea. This comes after Vietnam, which was blamed by China for exacerbating tensions, held a live fire drill and issued\na decree specifying who will be exempted from a\ndraft during a time of war. China is involved in a\nterritorial dispute with the Philippines, Malaysia, Vietnam and Brunei over the strategic Spratly and the\nParacels which are also believed to contain oil and\ngas deposits.\nSomalia\nSomalia\u2019s Prime Minister Mohamed Formajo has refused to resign, defying an UN-backed deal to oust\nhim. The deal extends the mandates of the Somali\nPresident, Speaker and their deputies until 2012,\nand was reached after months of squabbling between rival political parties. Mr Formajo claimed support from the people and there have been protests\nagainst the deal in the capital Mogadishu. Somalia\nhas been without an effective Government following\nthe fall of Said Bare\u2019s regime in 1991.\nEdited by Kenneth Lee\nThe Politics of Summer 2011\nWith Felix Politics on holiday for the summer,\nyou\u2019re probably worried that you\u2019ll either have\nto read a proper political paper for the next\nthree months (really very dull) or become completely ignorant of the world around you. Fear\nnot! Below are the only important headlines\nthat may, or may not, occur. Read these and\nyou can spend the rest of your summer lying\non a beach, without a care in the world.\nMuslim Brotherhood elected in Egypt\nFollowing the ousting of President Hosni\nMubarak after 30 years of power, the interim\nmilitary government has promised free and\nfair parliamentary elections in September. The\nGaddafi Dead\nWith pundits increasingly warning of a stale-mate, the western alliance has been increasing\nthe military assistance to the Libyan rebels.\nA victory would be a clear sign to other lead-ers, such as Syria\u2019s al\u2013Assad, that they are not\nimmortal. With any luck, it will also reduce\nsuspicion of the West, particularly important\nafter Blair and Sarkozy\u2019s \u201cdeal with the devil\u201d,\nwhen they met Gaddafi. It could also give a\npopularity boost to Presidents Sarkozy and\nObama who are both facing re-election.\nWho will come, who will see, who will conquer?\nRajat Jain\nSarkozy will not stand for re-election\nEarly next year, France will hold its Presidential elections, but incumbent Nicolas Sarkozy\nhas yet to say whether he will stand. His wife,\nwhose photos strangely seem to appear in\nmore newspapers during international conferences than her better half\u2019s, is pregnant and\nhas said she does not want him to stand but\nthat it is ultimately his choice. Despite Sarkozy\u2019s failure to reform the economy, he has\nstill been described the best candidate for the\njob by his centre-right party. He also no longer\nhas the threat of a strong centre left candidate.\nThe socialists were widely expected to choose\nDominique Strauss-Kahn who, as head of the\nIMF, was likely to understand how to keep the\neconomy strong and competitive while maintaining the values of the French Left. However,\nhe is facing trial in New York for rape. Instead,\nwith anti-Islamic sentiment growing since\n11th September 2001 and anti-European views\nemerging due to bailouts of weak economies\nsuch as that of Greece, it seems the far-right\nmay well sweep to victory. Their new leader,\nMarine Le Pen, is young, ambitious and char-ismatic. With no strong left-wing showing and\nno status quo candidate to fall back on from\nthe centre right, the EU\u2019s most important country could be about to elect a reactionary racist.\nSarah Palin to stand for president\nThe former Grand Old Party candidate for vicepresident has, at the time of writing, yet to declare whether she will stand for president. The\nformal elections aren\u2019t until next year, but the\nRepublican Party is preparing for its primaries,\nwith debates already taking place. Now, I\u2019m\nnot suggesting she is a credible candidate, but\nlet\u2019s face it - the only thing that makes these\nelections bearable, regardless of which party\nyou support, is the slightly thick Republican\ncandidates. With George W. Bush long gone\nand Donald Trump recently backing out, Palin\n(who recently questioned whether the Libyanmilitary-thing we\u2019re involved in is a war, intervention or \u201csquirmish\u201d), is looking to be\nthe our only chance to laugh smugly at Americans while sipping on fine wine in the south of\nFrance (or wherever you happen to summer).\nGreece defaults - Euro collapses\nEuropean Finance ministers have refused to\nincrease Greece\u2019s bailout or improve conditions unless austerity measures are pushed\nthrough. This, however, is becoming difficult\nas Greeks take to the streets in increasingly\nviolent protests against the proposed budget.\nDavid Cameron, meanwhile, has declared that\nhe is unwilling to increase loans to the Eurozone country unless he must do so due to IMF\nobligations. This all puts the Eurozone under\nincreasing pressure. ChancellorAngela Merkel\nof Germany has suggested allowing Greece to\ndefault if it comes to it, an option that is considered suicide for the Greek economy by\nmany economists. France\u2019s finance minister,\nChristine Lagarde, has refused to consider that\nas an option. If it were to happen, it could well\nsend a shock wave through Europe that could\nspell the end of the Euro.\nPresident Ahmadinejad faces impeachment\nOne would think the West would be excited by\nthe possibility of the end of the anti-Semitic,\nhomophobic, nuclear weapon developing,\nhate\u2013mongering and increasingly anti-demo-cratic rule of Iran\u2019s current president. Unfortunately, in Iran the president is not as powerful\nas the title might suggest and things can get a\nlot worse. Ahmadinejad is not facing pressure\nfrom the same moderate political opponents\nwho protested the election results in 2009, but\nfrom his former ally, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei, who is the absolute authority\nin this theocratic state. The first signs of a rift\nemerged in April, when the Supreme Leader\nreinstated the intelligence minister that Ahmadinejad had just fired. As befits any man with\na childish passive-aggressive personality, Ahmadinejad refused to turn up to work, missing\na number of important meetings, for eleven\ndays. Now the parliament has rejected two\nof his ministerial nominees, accusing him of\nchoosing friends and challenging clerical rule.\nPolitics in Iran is highly secretive but speculation is rife about the kind of power plays that\nare taking place between parliament, the revolutionary guard, guardian council and supreme\ncouncil, who all take some part in ruling the Islamic Republic. Ahmadinejad\u2019s impeachment\nor resignation looks increasingly likely. This\ncould signal an end to what little democracy\nthe people of Iran had since the 1979 revolu-tion. Alternatively, optimists may hope that it\nwill mean the end of nuclear weapons devel-opment, assuming Khamenei\u2019s fatwa against\nthem was sincere.\nproblem is Mubarak was not just unpopular for\nhis corruption and crackdown on dissidents,\nbut for making peace with Israel and being seen\nas a pawn for the West. The Muslim Brotherhood, a radical Islamist group, was legalised\nafter the revolution and formed its own party.\nRecently, they have declared an alliance with\nliberal parties, however if they make a strong\nshowing at elections, it could lead to new tensions with Israel and a step back in the Middle\nEast peace process. Intervention by the United\nStates or Israel may even be on the cards.\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX\n18\nCOM M ENT\nComment Editors: Anna Perman\nJan Piotrowski\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFriday 24 june 2011\nO\nne might think that, after having changed nine\nschools and two univer-sities, I\u2019d have gotten the\nhang of farewells.\nIt is true that up to the age of eight, I\ncan hardly remember some of the faces\nof my \u2018friends\u2019. Then again, were we\nreally \u2018friends\u2019? Surely rubbing paint in\neach other\u2019s faces and playing tag during recess (as I did with one particular\nboy) is not what you\u2019d call friendship\nnow. Nevertheless, despite the childish\nnature of these attempts at socialising,\nyou might even conclude we had a crush\ngoing on. I never got to say goodbye to\nhim because I actually did not know I\nwas going to leave the States in the summer of 1997, for good.\nBy the age of sixteen, I think I got so\nbitter about continually leaving that I\nstopped socialising in secondary school.\nI was the tall kid with the massive headphones and the dark jeans, and I spent\nquite a significant amount of my time\nwith my head buried in a book. It would\nbe stupid of me to say I did not have any\nfriends, I just never made much of an\neffort to \u2018hang out\u2019 after school. I knew\nthat in a year or so, I\u2019d leave them and\nthat would be that.\nBut then, after we graduated in 2007,\nthey made the effort to see me. An email\nturned into an in-depth analysis of Anna\nKarenina and some of the best brownie\nrecipes I have ever tasted. These two\npeople were quite different, and I am not\nsure they would have gotten along, but\nsurprisingly, they mirrored some of my\ninterests and I found that I was laughing\nat a computer screen every other night.A\ngraduation trip to Ibiza was a nice kickoff for the summer before uni started,\nand I found that I enjoyed just having\nfun with other people. By the time I was\nleaving Sarajevo and Vienna to come to\nLondon, I had a handful of new friends\nand we have managed to stay in contact every now and then. Holiday trips\nto Christmas markets, catching up with\nfriends, English-style pubs everywhere\nI go, and nice tunes in the background\nare what I love about going back home.\nOh and homemade food only my mum\ncan make.\nFast forward almost four years to that\npost-final exam Union session and one\nmight think that indeed, we no longer\nhave the \u2018until I finish uni\u2019 excuse to\nuse. Most of the people I know will go\non to work in the City as consultants,\na few are starting their PhDs and second MSc\u2019s, and a handful will still be at\nImperial for another year. It seems that\neveryone has been doing the same thing\nfor the past month \u2013 everyone is saying\ntheir goodbyes.\nWith one group of friends, I vouched\nto meet up once a year in a different place in the world. With another, I\npromised to visit London every now and\nagain. I\u2019ve offered my home for each\nand everyone to come and visit and I\nreally do mean it when I say \u201cI\u2019ll miss\nyou\u201d. There are a couple of instances\nwhere I have even forgotten to say those\nthree words \u2013 it might have been due\nto the fact that it was quite late at night\nthat The Goodbye had taken place, or\nWe\u2019ll meet again\nmaybe even because I had thought it\nwas a foolish thing to stay. Wasn\u2019t it\nobvious that I\u2019d miss you all? Everyone\nhas their moments and each relationship\nis unique. If it were up to me, we\u2019d all\nbe able to teleport or travel at the speed\nof light whenever we wanted to. And I\nchoose to ignore the limitations of that\nidea.\nOne night in November 2007, a friend\nand I blagged our way into a VIP area\nof a nightclub in Piccadily. It was about\none in the morning when I saw a familiar face walk into the room and I heard\nmy name screamed over the music:\nNAIDAAAAAAA!! My reaction was\nthe same and this was a perfect example\nof one of the things I tend to repeat in\nmy monotonous goodbye speeches: The\nworld is extremely small and I keep getting astonished at how often this has\nbeen demonstrated to myself. I am not\nafraid to say that indeed, I\u2019m one of\nthose suckers who believe that we shall\nmeet again when the time is right \u2013 or\nwhen I happen to find a better brownie\nrecipe to share. Goodbye my friends,\nuntil we meet again!\nSaying goodbye isn\u2019t easy, no matter how often you do it\nNaida Dzigal\nHave your say on\nthis article at\nfelixonline.co.uk\n\u201c\ng\ng\nas\nas\no\no\nds\n\u201d\nThe world is extremely small \u2013 I\nam astonished at how often\nthis has been demonstrated\nI hope that you will excuse me for writing in\nthe first person. This is the last article I will\never write as Editor of this publication and, as\nsuch, it is quite a significant moment for me.\nWhen I first came to Imperial in 2007 to\nstudy Physics, I would not have believed\nit possible that one could invest so much\ntime, effort, and emotion into any one proj-ect. I started right at the bottom of the Felix hierarchy, writing articles for the Politics\nsection (in fact, I think I may have started\neven lower than this; my first appearance in\nFelix was in a photograph of a cross-dress-ing party from halls). The newspaper quickly\nbecame a home for me, a place where I met\nmy closest friends and found refuge from\nmy sometimes-stifling studies.\nMy writing was incredibly poor, and my editing probably worse. I made a shocking number of mistakes and missteps; I am happy\nto say that this continues, though, I hope, at\na marginally reduced frequency. I remember\ntrying to resign my position as Politics Editor\nafter a particularly awful week \u2013 three separate letters of complaint about three separate problems in my section \u2013 but the Deputy Editor at the time understood that Felix\nis built upon inclusiveness, opportunity, and\nhumility; he laughed off my resignation and\ntold me to try harder next week.\nFrom these ignominious beginnings, I\nworked my way up the ladder, learning different skills in different sections, until, in\nmy 4th year, the student body gave me the\nopportunity to take the helm. It is not a responsibility that I have always felt comfortable holding and I have not always fulfilled\nmy duties as well as I should have. Where\nI have made mistakes I have done my best\nto correct them and I have always endeav-oured to, in the words that stay with me\nthree years on, \u2018try harder next week\u2019.\nHowever, though the work has been hard\nand the hours long, it has always been a\nprivilege to edit this paper with the many students who volunteer their time in the Felix office each week. It has been deeply fulfilling to\nsee my ideas and aims become reality, and\nit has been a joy to see students and staff\npick up the paper each week. There is nothing quite like it. The depths I sink to when I\nmake an error are nothing to the dizzyingly-high peaks when someone dashes over to\ngrab a copy as soon as I have laid it down.\nI have worked on this paper for four\nyears \u2013 despite, paradoxically, having only\ncompleted three years of my degree \u2013 and\nit is time for myself and my generation of\neditors, to let a new generation shape Felix,\nand make of it what they will. I would only\nask them to always remain true to its ethos:\nto always ask people to \u2018try harder next\nweek\u2019 instead of chastising them; to always\nmake every effort to encourage students to\nget involved; to always be humble enough\nto admit their mistakes; and to always give\nFelix their all, and then some. For me, it is\ngoodbye. Thank you all for your support.\nFELIX\n\u2018Try harder next week\u2019\nHello, goodbye... see you on the other side!\n\u201cI thought it was a\nfoolish thing to say.\nWasn\u2019t it obvious I\u2019d\nmiss you all?\u201d\n\n"

    "content": "24 FELIX\nFriday 24 JUNE 2011\nMusic Editors: Greg Power\nLuke Turner\nStephen Smith\nmusic.felix@gmail.com\nMUSIC\n1979 holds the key to the farthest reaches of musical conception. That year,\nNurse With Wound released their debut album Chance Meeting on a Dissecting Table of a Sewing Machine and\nan Umbrella. Their music is the aural\nequivalent to the paintings of Salvador\nDal\u00ed, stretching the mind and questioning reality. The surrealistic instrumentation and Dadaist approach are an amalgam of some of the strangest music of\nmodern times. Tucked into the vinyl\ngatefold, the revered NWW List payed\nhomage to their influences and bore the\nwonder for others to discover.\nFrom Henri Chopin to Karlheinz\nStockhausen, through the Velvet Underground and into Tangerine Dream,\nthe list spans and pulls together the most\nunlikely of artists. Dabbling in psychedelics and staggering with no-wave\ndrawl, rolling the rocks in one ear and\nout the other.\nThe list pays its respects to a horde of\nhomegrown freethinkers and experimen-talists such as industrial outfit Throbbing Gristle and freakfolk gem Comus.\nAmong other London-based groups appear AMM, pioneers of free-improvi-sation, whose founding member Eddie\nPr\u00e9vost can be found on Sunday nights\nholding improvisation workshops in the\nbasement of a chapel in Borough.\nOne of the most influential bands on\nthe list is Essex-based anarcho-punks\nCrass, who cemented the conscientious\nand passionate cornerstones of the punk\nmind, burning in the grasp of Thatcherism. Taking up camp in the Dial House\ncommune in the Essex countryside, they\nnurtured a creative environment for free\nexpression, which still exists today and\nis documented in the film There is No\nAuthority but Yourself.\nStrongly represented is the psychedelic krautrock movement which sprouted\nin Germany at the end of the 60\u2019s in\nresponse to the summer of love. Noting the seminal meanderings of Can,\ncommune jam band Amon D\u00fc\u00fcl and of\ncourse one of the biggest influences on\nmodern electronic music, Kraftwerk.\nJohn Cage makes an appearance as\nwell as Greek architect-turned-compos-er Iannis Xenakis, who used the mathematics of chance and architecture in\nmany of his works.Avant garde guitarist\nFred Frith is also mentioned alongside\nFrank Zappa\u2019s Mothers of Invention.\nThe list is a colourful display of originality and with bands such as The Deep\nFreeze Mice or Lemon Kittens, sometimes it\u2019s worth reading for the names\nalone. For the curious ear, it is a mere\nchip of the cookie and a musical map\ntowards deeper horizons.\nMusic to make you question reality\nIs it me or is this the greatest album cover ever? Just me? Shit\nD\near Friend: it would\nappear that we are approaching the end.\nWe\u2019ve had some laughs,\nwe\u2019ve shed some tears. I\nthink overall we had a pretty damn good\ntime, wouldn\u2019t you say?\nI\u2019ve very much enjoyed being one\nof the Music Editors for Felix this\nyear. It\u2019s one of those things that got\nme through the tougher times of life at\nImperial. Being a student at one of the\nUK\u2019s leading institutions is rewarding\nmore often than not, but let\u2019s just say\nthere\u2019s a dark and demanding side too.\nAnd you don\u2019t want that stuff to bring\nyou down. This is why it is so important to have extracurricular funtimes\nto latch onto, balancing out the good\nand the bad vibes: the yin and the yang\nof the student struggle, if you will.\nPerhaps this sort of activity is even\nmore important in a place like Imperial, where I am convinced people at\ntimes believe there is nothing more to\nthe student than his/her subject matter.\nThis makes me sad.\nI remember Fresher\u2019s Week like it\nwas yesterday. Okay, not really. But\nanyway I remember arriving at Imperial and people guaranteeing that I would\nbe bored of the Union by the end of the\nfirst term. The naysayers had a point:\nit was nice to get out of the Imperial\nbubble and explore all the wonders\nLondon has to offer, be it musical or\notherwise. I\u2019ve had the opportunity to\nsee most of my favourite bands of all\ntime during my time at Imperial (here\u2019s\nto you Mars Volta, Nine Inch Nails,\nHealth, Dillinger Escape Plan and\nFlight of the Conchords to name but\na few of you fucking legends) leaving\nme with many fond memories of unforgettable performances, shared with\nmy best friends. I\u2019ve also discovered so\nmuch great new music just by staying\nopen and receptive to all opportunities\nof seeing and hearing brilliant up-and-comers with bright futures ahead of\nthem (I love you Factory Floor).\nI guess I\u2019ve always had - and needed - music. I\u2019m grateful that I found\nso many other people who think the\nsame way despite the pressures of Imperial. Even though we might not be\nrenowned for our talent for Arts here\nat ol\u2019 Gimperial, some of the most talented musicians I have met in my life\nwalk amongst us nerds incognito. If\nyou\u2019ve ever seen Will Jones shred on\nthe guitar or Aaron Berk punishing the\ndrums, then you\u2019ll know exactly what\nI\u2019m talking about. Jazz & Rock Soc is\na haven for Imperial musicians, and I\ntip my tophat to the gents that run that\nbeautifully-oiled machine. Long live\nJ&R. I also want to take this opportunity to publicize that Nick Read is an\nall-around badass.\nI am also forever indebted to the Sexiest Editor Alive (not an actual award,\nKensington Gore, styling back in \u201808, when the world was a simpler place\nFamous last words\nGregory Power wishes you a fond farewell\nthough it totally should be): Kadhim\nMotherhugging Shubber. Not only\nfor letting me spread my dribble on\nthese pages, tainting the holy institution\nthat is Felix, but also for believing in\nmy ridiculous plans. Seriously, I spent\na lot of time at the Union complaining\nabout the quality of the acts. And most\nof the time under the influence of beer\nand whiskey. So when I set out to throw\ntogether a \u201cpunk\u201d, cheap-as-chips DIY\nmusic night at Imperial, only a madman\nwould have actually backed my fantasies with cold hard cash. Luckily my\ngood friend Kadhim is a poet, which is\nclose enough to mad for me, and so my\ndream of a united Imperial music scene\nmaterialised not once \u2013 but twice.\nThrough these activities I met a\nwhole new cast of awesome peeps from\nMusic Tech. First and foremost, my\nhomeboy I\u00f1igo Martinez de Rituerto,\nwho introduced me to a load of talented\nelectronic maestros. David Trevelyan\n(Phrij), Will Berg (Niceberg), Adam\nChainz and the rest of y\u2019all - you rock\nmy world. Long after I\u2019m done at Imperial I\u2019ll still be looking for new material\nby these guys, along with soon-to-be\nBBC Sound of 2012 winners Monsk,\nVetoes and The Tin Can 44s. I\u2019m kidding of course, I would never wish that\nsort of horror upon them. I know that\nthey will however move onto bigger\nand greater things.\nAs for the Union itself, looking back I\nnow realize I may have been a bit harsh\nin my inebriated judgement: the Stop\nThat Urban Noise nights were actually\nkind of awesome: great line-ups, (Rus-ko, Chase & Status) plagued by Imperial\u2019s general apathy and poor turnouts.\nI applaud Malcolm Macpherson and\nRavi Pall for this, as well as for some\ngreat Summer Ball performances - especially that insane Scratch Perverts\nset last year.\nOne last shout-out and then I\u2019ll get\nout of your hair and become just another\nnameless face you might or might not\nremember ten years from now. Selective memory is funny like that. I want to\nthank the boys from Kensington Gore\n(get low, bitches) and Operation Midnight Complex (or A Badger Cadaver,\nMalarky, T Minus, and whatever we\u2019re\ncalled next year): you guys are seriously\nbad mofos.\nAnd so my job here is done. I\u2019m\npleased to hand over the music section\nto Stephen and I\u00f1igo. They\u2019re more\nthan qualified for the role and I\u2019m sure\nthey\u2019ll do an awesome job.\nIn retrospect, Imperial isn\u2019t half as\nbad as people initially made it out to be.\nThere\u2019s good people, good parties and\ndamn good music. If you have any interest in music (and I don\u2019t trust anyone\nwho says they don\u2019t) then I urge you to\nget involved.As a performer, as a fan, as\na Felix contributor; whatever floats your\nboat. Just keep on rocking, baby.\nI\u00f1igo Martinez de Rituerto de Troya walks you through the influences of the weirdest band ever\n\n"

    "content": "TELEVISION\nFELIX\n28\nTelevision Editors: Matt Allinson\nJames Simpson\ntv.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFriday 24 june 2011\nTwo Girls One Cup. It\u2019s shit...\nJames Simpson\nTwo Girls One Cup is a scatological\nfantasy drama centered around a\nsolitary cup, which is shared by the\ntwo girls named in the title. Produced\nby Brazilian company MFX Media in\n2007, it is the notorious work of the self-described \u201ccompulsive fetishist\u201d Marco\nFiorito. What a dirty bastard he is.\nOriginally intended as a trailer for\nthe (now apparently banned) film\n\u201cHungry Bitches\u201d, Two Girls One Cup\nis at its most efficacious when viewed\nimmediately after a meal. Particularly\nif that meal consisted of chocolate ice\ncream.\nThe opening scene manifests itself\nto the viewer much like the average\nlesbian pornographic movie would (I\nassume...). The two main characters are\nkissing to the soundtrack of \u201cLovers\u2019\u2019\nTheme\u201d from Gerard Oury\u2019s 1971\nfilm \u201cDelusions of Grandeur\u201d. The\naudience are then transported via the\nmedium of a rapid crossfade to the\ndebut appearance of The Cup. The Cup\nis proffered unwillingly to the anus, as if\nblissfully unaware of what it is about to\nreceive, and then, in a fleeting moment\nof cataclysmic defecation, its purpose\nbecomes apparent.\nIn the now infamous words of the\nUgandan Pastor Doctor Martin Ssempa,\nthe two girls then proceed to eat da poo\npoo, like ice cream, like ice cream.\nRather than summarily vomiting, the\nTwo Girls find the need to induce\nphysical sickness by means of the\npharyngeal reflex. This, I summise, is\nrather strange given that they have both\njust engaged in an act of mutual fecal\nconsumption.\nLogic, it seems, is precluded here.\nOne might suspect that the motive\nbehind the vomiting may be to expel\nthe ingested detritus, but the disgorged\nfilth is poured unceremoniously into the\nmouths of the Girls and onto The Cup,\nwhich is still brimming with recently\nexcreted fecal matter. The Cup is then\nutilised without delay as the source of\nthis egregious, bilious mixture, which\nbecomes the catalyst for an intense\nsequence of lustful undertakings.\nThe screen fades to black and I can\nstop peeking through my cardigan. The\nsixty-second clip is probably the most\ncoprophagia I have witnessed since\nNick Clegg had to eat his own words\nover tuition fees. There is (I am told)\na conspiracy surrounding the origin\nof the brown substance which is so\nvoraciously gorged upon by the Two\nGirls - apparently it\u2019s ice cream. Fiorito\nallegedly uses chocolate ice cream in\nsome of his movies, to \u201cappease some\nof his actors who [are] willing to appear\nin scat films but not actually eat fecal\nmatter\u201d. I hope so. Don\u2019t watch it.\nG\niven that we have\nmonths of freedom in\nwhich one could watch\nanything one wanted to\non TV, I thought that I\nmight bring back a brilliant and unique\nseries from the depths of Dave and\nDave-ja-vu.\nBlackadder \u2013 which stars the\nhilarious Rowan Atkinson in its title\nrole \u2013 is a fantastic sitcom based\naround Edmund Blackadder (a butler)\nand his Dogsbody, Baldrick - played\nby Time Team\u2019s very own Tony\nRobinson. Considering the abundance\nof rarely-bettered one-liners such as\n\u201cAM I GLAD TO SEE YOU OR DID\nSOMEONE JUST PUT A CANOE IN\nMY POCKET?\u201d I\u2019d be surprised if you\nhadn\u2019t heard of it before now.\nThroughout the latter three series (I\u2019m\ndiscounting the first one because it\u2019s\ngenerallyacceptedthatitisn\u2019tverygood)\nEdmund and Baldrick are surrounded\nby a variety of other characters, played\nby such big names as Stephen Fry, Hugh\nLaurie and Rik Mayall (right) as Lord\nFlashheart (Series 2, Episode 1). My\nmother fancies him.\nI don\u2019t think I could possibly ever\nreccommend any series more. Seriously,\nwatch it!\nCurrently on BBC1 is the second\nseries of the award-winning detective\ndrama Luther.

Sixteen twatty\npeople vie for the role of Lord Sugar\u2019s\n\u2018Apprentice\u2019 which, he says, carries a\nsix-figure salary (he probably includes\na couple of decimal places, the stingy\nbastard).

    "content": "FELIX Friday 24 june 2011 27\nGAMES\nThe internet and games. They were always going to go hand-in-hand, and I\u2019m\nsure the gaming industry would look\nvery different today if not for the advent\nof personal broadband. Of course, there\nare the obvious benefits such as online\nmultiplayer and downloadable content,\nbut there are also slightly more subtle\nways the internet has changed the indus-try. Things that are not so immediately\napparent.\nBut, however known to everyone\nthey may be, it would be wrong not to\ntalk about those internet-enabled elements that have the most impact. Online\nmultiplayer is huge. Whether you like\nto run around killing people in Call of\nDuty or quest with friends in World of\nWarcraft, it\u2019s almost certainly going to\nbe online. There are many, many games\nout there which are far more fun to play\nwith people you know, and the internet\nmakes that far easier. It removes the\nbarriers of you and your friends having to be in the same place on the same\nnetwork \u2013 hugely reducing the hassle\nof playing together. For most people it\nalso probably increases the number of\nfriends they can play with on a regular\nbasis, with location no longer an issue.\nA good thing then, certainly.\nThen there\u2019s downloadable content.\nThere are possibly mixed opinions on\nthis one. Some may see it as a nice way\nfor developers to provide more content\nfor your game, while others might think\nit\u2019s a way to pay more for the content\nthat would have been included in days\ngone by. Indeed, there was general outrage when 2K Games released a downloadable expansion for Bioshock 2, and\nit was proved that the content was already on the disc.\nAlso, sometimes the prices are (or at\nleast seem) ridiculous. For example, the\nCall of Duty: Black Ops map packs retail for \u00a311.49 each \u2013 just under a third\nof what you pay for the game in the first\nplace, and only for five additional maps!\nBut at the other end of the spectrum,\nwhere the prices are lower, you may\nstill end up paying more. It\u2019s a classic\ntechnique \u2013 consumers are less likely to\nbother to keep track of micro-payments,\nand hence will actually spend more of\ntheir cash. Let\u2019s look at buying additional songs in Rock Band/Guitar Hero\nas an example. A single song download\nwill knock you back around \u00a31.50. It\ndoesn\u2019t seem much at first glance, but it\nwill soon rack up. Without this however,\nyou\u2019d have to rely on the developer releasing a disc with extra songs on \u2013 pre-chosen and at a specific price. At least\nwith downloads you get the choice.\nPatches are in a similar vein. It\u2019s almost impossible for a developer to release an entirely bug-free game. Even\nthough games studios pour hours upon\nhours into testing, quality assurance and\nfixes, it is as Josh Olin of Treyarch said:\n\u201cIf you look at the population size of\nthe Call of Duty franchise, just a single\nhour of gameplay collectively after the\ngame\u2019s been out - you add up all the\nman-hours that all the fans put into itthat\u2019s more time than you could put into\nQuality Assurance in a lifetime.\u201d So \u2013\neven for an offline game \u2013 the internet\nmakes it very simple for games developers to distribute patches for inevitable\nissues. On the flip-side however, it could\nbe said that this makes said developers\nlazier. Armed with the knowledge that\nfixes for any arising problems can easily\nbe provided to the users, it\u2019s certainly\nconceivable that games could be pushed\nout sooner with less testing. It would\nprobably save the developers money\nif the early adopters become testers of\nsorts, but it\u2019s something we definitely\ndon\u2019t want to see.\nHowever, there are ways when early\nadopters being testers can be very bene-ficial, and that\u2019s for indie games. Games\nlike Minecraft get a lot out of those people who buy early versions of the game.\nThose who are playing it in such early\nstages are likely to want to help out with\naiding development, so they\u2019ll submit\nany bugs they find. On top of that, the\ntesting is free(!) but it is probably going to be more sporadic than proper\nuser testing. Also, without the internet,\ngames like Minecraft wouldn\u2019t even be\non the map. Indie games wouldn\u2019t be\nable to create any sort of presence without driving forces such as social media.\nSo what else has the internet changed\nabout the gaming industry? In the same\nway that the internet has changed almost everything, it is so much easier\nto find information about games. In\nmany cases, there is a plethora of information available about a title even\nbefore it is out. Take Super Smash\nBros. Brawl as an example: before its\nrelease you could find out every char-acter, stage and item. On top of that,\nevery gamer has a dozen different reviews for a game at his or her disposal\nat the click of a button. Long gone are\nthe days when you need to buy a gaming magazine to find out about upcoming games, or just guess as to whether\nor not a game will be good. Nor do we\nneed to ring a premium rate number or\nbuy a guide to complete a game, with\nonline walkthroughs available for almost every game.\nThose gaming magazines also used\nto give access to new games via demo\ndiscs. For a few years, due to rising\ncosts and lack of demand, demo discs\nwent into decline. However, thanks to\nthe ease of distribution thanks to the\ninternet, there are many more demos\nbeing produced today. These are mainly on the consoles though, with the\nmanufacturers offering a fairly easy\nway for developers to push out their\ngames.\nWhat PC gamers sometimes do,\nthough, is adopt a bit of a try-before-you-buy mentality. Some gamers will\nillegally download a copy of the game\nfirst to try it out and see if they like it.\nOf course, this ties into the big problem\nof pirating games in general, but it\u2019s\nan interesting use-case of sorts. Other\npeople sometimes illegally download\ngames for emulators of their favourite\nconsoles. This though is usually not for\ncurrent generation consoles, as emulators are inherently inefficient.\nThere are many more ways that the\ninternet has altered the gaming sector,\nmore than it is possible to detail in this\narticle. For example, services like Steam\nfor digital content distribution, the rise\nof global leaderboards and rankings,\nand the possibilities of game-streaming\nservices such as OnLive. Nevertheless,\nI think it\u2019s safe to say the internet has\ndefinitely affected the gaming industry,\nand mostly in positive ways. And I\u2019m\nsure it will continue to do so for the\nforeseeable future.\nHOW HAS\nTHE INTERNET\nCHANGED THE\nGAMES INDUSTRY?\nChris Bowers\nOblivion\u2019s useless \u2018horse armour\u2019 is widely regarded as the \u2018worst downloadeable content of all time\u2019\n\u201cIndie games\nwouldn\u2019t be able to\ncreate any sort of\npresence without\ndriving forces such\nas social media\u201d\n\u201c\n\n"

    "content": "3\nFELIX Friday 24 june 2011\nNEWS\nThe Union have admitted that the\nturnout at last week\u2019s Summer Ball\nwas disappointing, saying that the\npoor weather, a low turnout from other\nuniversities, and the number of students\nwho hadn\u2019t finished their exams \u201chad a\nbig hit on sales.\u201d\nThe Union were forced to hold the\nSummer Ball two weeks before the\nend of term this year, instead of the\nusual one week, because the clash\nwith Glastonbury meant that \u201cacts\nand equipment\u201d would have been too\ndifficult to hire. Union President Alex\nKendall explained that the difficulty in\nhaving the Summer Ball at the very end\nKadhim Shubber\nDisappointing\nSummer Ball turnout\nUnion expected to release Ball\nfinances next week\nthe event, and on the day, meant \u201clast\nminute ticket sales weren\u2019t as good.\u201d\nIn previous years there has been a\nsignificant spike in ticket sales in the\nrun-up to the Summer Ball and several\nhundred on-the-door sales.\nHowever, he also pointed to the live\nmusic on offer, like Laura Marling and\nIan Brown, saying that \u201cthe live acts\nwere great,\u201d and pointed out that the\nSummer Ball after-party was \u201cpacked.\u201d\nThe after-party in the Union had a\ncapacity of 1000 students and ended\nat 4am. Agreements with the Council\nand neighbours over noise meant that\nthe after-party could not continue\ninto Sunday as in previous years. The\nSurvivor\u2019s Photo had to be hastily\norganized by a Felix photographer at\nthe end of the night when it became\nclear that arrangements had not been\nmade.\nKendall said the Union had been\nvindicated in removing an explicit\nblack tie dress code and letting\npeople wear what they want at the\nSummer Ball: \u201cI think we clearly\nwere justified in saying that black tie\nwasn\u2019t compulsory as people looked\ncomfortable in whatever they were\nwearing.\u201d\nThe Summer Ball was split between\ntwo stages this year, with student\nbands in Prince\u2019s Gardens and external\nacts on the main stage on the Queen\u2019s\nLawn. The low turnout meant that\nPrince\u2019s Gardens, where the food stalls\nwere sited, was virtually empty for\nmuch of the day. Kendall admitted that\nthe Prince\u2019s Gardens stage \u201ccould have\nbeen more full.\u201d\nDeputy President (Finance &\nServices)-elect Michael Foster, whose\nresponsibility it is to plan next year\u2019s\nSummer Ball, said that he would gauge\nthe reaction of students \u201cand adapt\naccordingly.\u201d He assured students that\nany decisions on the direction of the\nSummer Ball \u201cwill be based on student\ninput, opinion and feedback, as well as\nan objective assessment of the Ball\u2019s\nsuccess.\u201d\nof term, after everybody\u2019s exams, is that\nfirst years would be moving out of halls.\nThe full financial implications of the\npoor turnout are not yet known but the\nUnion says it will release the full figures\nearly next week; it is still analysing\nbar sales and tickets sold on the day.\nHowever, members of the Union have\nprivately acknowledged that the losses\ncould run into the low tens of thousands.\n1269 tickets were sold, with the vast\nmajority of this believed to be Imperial\nstudents. Union President Alex Kendall\nsaid, \u201cI would suggest not expecting\nturnout from other [universities] in\nthe future,\u201d although other students\nwould always be welcome. He said\nthat the poor weather in the run-up to\nFelix has set up an\nonline Summer Ball\nfeedback form. Tell us\nwhat you thought of the\nBall if you went, and\nif you didn\u2019t go let us\nknow why at felixonline.\nco.uk/summerball\nStudents warned about\ncampus pervert\nOn Saturday 18th June, during the\nSummer Ball, an at around 3pm in\nthe Central Library, a female Imperial\nstudent, who has asked to remain\nanonymous, was followed into the 2nd\nfloor toilets by another person who then\nattempted to take pictures of her by\nsliding their mobile phone underneath\nthe stall.\nThe female student told Felix that,\n\u201cthis person positioned herself/himself\nin the cubicle to me and proceeded to\ntake a succession of photos of me with\na mobile phone by sliding their hand\nfrom underneath the partition and then\nagain from underneath the door before\nfleeing.\u201d\nAfter the initial shock of the incident,\nthe female student informed the security\nguard on duty, who had spotted a tall,\nslim man of Oriental descent taking\npictures of him on a mobile just\nmoments before she had arrived.\nEven though the library was virtually\nempty, the student remembered that\nthere was also another female student\nstanding outside the toilets by the water\nfountain at the time of the incident. She\ndescribed her as \u201caround 5 foot 2-3ish,\nwith long brown hair and wearing\ncolourful shoes.\u201d\nAemun Reza The student said that \u201cwhen I first\nspoke to campus security, they seemed\nvery taken aback at the incident, and\nI guess I could assume that this sort\nof thing probably had never occurred\nbefore.\u201d\nShe then reported the incident to\nSherfield security in the hope that\nthey would be able to examine CCTV\nsecurity but she felt that the female\nsupervisor showed a \u201ccomplete lack\nof sensitivity and rudeness.\u201d However,\nsecurity has been through the CCTV\nfootage of the reception but could not\ncome across an Oriental male holding a\nmobile phone in the reception area. The\nHead of Security of Sherfield informed\nFelix that there are no CCTV cameras in\nthe area of the bathroom.\nThey believe that finding the exact\nidentity of the person will be difficult\ndue to lack of description from the\nlibrary security guard and the fact\nthat the female student only caught a\nglimpse of hand taking the picture. They\nassured Felix that they are doing all they\ncan to catch the offender.\nHowever, the female student was\nunhappy with the way her case has\nbeen dealt with. \u201cFor the amount of\ntuition fees Imperial charges, this sort\nof appalling level of service provided\nfor the safety of its students is, I feel,\nutterly unacceptable,\u201d she said. Even\nthough security had immediately\ncontacted the police and advised the\nstudent to do the same, she still felt\nthat she had to take the responsibility\nof reporting the incident to the Chelsea\nPolice station herself, where she then\nsays she waited for four and a half\nhours to talk to an officer. An officer\nhas been assigned to the case and a\nreport is going to be filed.\nAs this incident occurred during the\nexam period, the female student was\n\u201cpretty shaken\u201d as it has significantly\naffected her revision. She said that her\ndepartment was \u201cfairly sympathetic\u201d\nbut felt that they weren\u2019t \u201cparticularly\nsupportive\u201d. The department stated,\n\u201cThe regrettable incident described has\nbeen noted by the relevant Personal\nTutor, the Senior Tutor and the\nExaminations Officer and placed on\nfile. The incident will be discussed by\na sub-board of the Board Examiners\nconsisting of the Senior Tutor, the\nDirector of Undergraduate Studies\nand the Chairman of the Board of\nExaminers in July and then again at\nfinal moderation.\u201d\nThe female student would like to warn\nother females to be vigilant about \u201csuch\na depraved person roaming around\nCollege.\u201d\nAwards\nRector\u2019s Awards for Excellence in\nPastoral Care and for Supporting\nthe Student Experience\nExcellence in Pastoral Care\nDr Martyn Boutelle (Rector\u2019s\nMedal)\nDr Vanessa Garcia Larsen\nDr David Hartley\nProfessor Anthony Kucernak\nDr Paul Wilde - Chemistry\nExcellence in Supporting the\nStudent Experience\nMiss Amy Allinson\nMiss Julia Cork\nDr Lorraine Craig (Rector\u2019s\nMedal)\nMrs Joanne Harlow\nMr Chris Harris\nMiss Anna Hikel\nDr Martin Holloway\nDr Philip Power\nDr Emma Watson (Rector\u2019s\nMedal)\nMs Jo Williams\nUnion: Recreational Clubs\nCommittee (RCC) Colours\nDistinguished Service Award\nDavid Coolegem\nJennifer Wilson\nSimon Child\nRachel Fox\nFull Colours\nRyan Tunstall\nClare Tan\nMarie-Eugenie Joanny\nRobin Jones\nTimothy Runcorn\nWilliam Mason\nHalf Colours\nChristina Kontoghiorghe\nGemma Bale\nChoo Zheng\nJonathan Ely\nJaimie Henry\nYi Fei Li\nJonathan\nPritchard\nSara Arbos Torrent\nThea Powell\nWilliam French\nJohn Davey\nWilliam Eldred\nJan Jachnik\nRoyal College of Science Union\n(RCSU) Colours\nPresident\u2019s Award\nPaul Beaumont\nElwin Carlos\nLaura Jeffrey\nOutstanding Service\nElwin Carlos\nDeep Shah\nHalf Colours\nJoanna Cai\nSilvia Colucci\nLisa Hale\nAlan Itakura\nChandni Nakum\nMia O\u2019Gorman\nStefano Pennese\nWilliam Prince\nJohn-Oliver\nThornton\nElena Trabucchi\nMaria Veiga\nFull Colours\nBen Chappell\nVanessa Hume\nZeki IIkan\nKing-Hing Lo\nJacklyn Nagle\nDan Wan\nEdward Willans\nKelvin Wong\n\n"
