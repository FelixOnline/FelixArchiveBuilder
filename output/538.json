    "content": "FILMS\nDue for release in the next week are two very interesting films.\nAPOCALYPSE NOW\n(X, Francis Coppola)\nThe guilt and fears of the American people over their involvement\nin Vietnam have fostered several features on the subject. By far the\nmost impressive and direct is this truly grim epic of carnage and\ndestruction.\nCaptain Willard (Martin Sheen) is a young agent who is sent on a mission to 'terminate' the command of Colonel Kurtz (Marlon\nBrando). He is told that Kurtz is mad; he is told Kurtz is a murderer;\nhe is told Kurtz must be terminated. Yet despite this Willard cannot\nbelieve that one of America's best Colonels has done anything with no\nreason.\nKurtz has become the God of an army of ruthless natives who\nfollow his orders to the limit. He has a renegade army at his control\nand wages a path of terror and destruction. Willard, the 'messenger\nboy' of the American military must locate and also destroy. He\njourneys up a river in a patrol boat with a crew of four; during the trip\nhe is influenced by their experiences and attempts to understand\nKurtz's actions.\nCoppola believes he has created a film which will communicate the\nfull horror of war \u2014 he bases it strongly on visuals and leaves the plot\ndeliberately thin. There are some stunning sequences, notably the\ndestruction of a village by Lt Colonel Kilgore (Robert Duval!) who\nblasts out Wagnar from his helicopters as they spew bullets, rockets\nand napalm.\nI cannot comment on the ethical and political side of it, but can say\nthat the message seems to be that good and evil can be mixed where\nit is convenient. This was done in Vietnam and Coppola wishes to\nexpose the lie that the people of that time were living. Don't kid\nyourself, it applies to you as well. Amos f enjoyable film which should\nnot be missed.\nMarlon Brando plays Colonel Kurtz.\nby MARK SMITH\nSTAR TREK\nTHE MOTION PICTURE\n(Robert Wise)\nPersis Khambatta as Ilia, the Deltan navigator of the\nEnterprise.\nOn a completely different theme and bias is this feature based on\nthe cult TV series. The technology is better, the effects more\nstunning, but the characters and ideas are the same.\nNot many people have dared to portray the optimism and joy that\nGene Rodenberry has in Star Trek. He delights in the idea that the\nhuman race can and will survive, becoming more benevolent and\nunderstanding as they grow.\nLess of the ideas, what about the film? As a keen fan of the series I expected a great deal and was only partly rewarded. The crew of the\nEnterprise are reunited to face an imminent peril; Earth is threatened\nby a mysterious cloud which is approaching the planet rapidly. The\nEnterprise is in 'dry dock' following re-design and is the only available\nstarship which can investigate. Admiral Kirk takes over command\nafter spending several years on Earth. He is unfamiliar with the new\nship but will not allow Captain Decker to face this ultimate threat\nalone. Spock, McCoy and all the other crew soon arrive, as well as the\nbeautiful Ilia, a bald headed woman from the planet Delta.\nI found the film very enjoyable, even though tedious in places. The\nstory is a little disjointed but as the characters are already so familiar,\nthey compensate for this. The only disappointment was the ending. I think that in an attempt to emulate 2001: A Space Odyssey that they\nlost a lot. Here though significance is pointed out and strange\ncircumstances clearly explained, leaving little to the imagination. The\nmessage of optimism is great, but you need n't ram it home quite as\nclearly.\nAnyway besides that it was very enjoyable. Fans of the series will\nnot want to miss the return of their favourites, but I feel that the\nappeal will not be much greater. Treat it as escapism and you'll end up\nfeeling warm inside. Otherwise don't bother.\n10\n\n"

    "content": "LETTERS THE FELIX SOCIETY\nWith the thirtieth anniversary of FELIX last week, it seems\nappropriate that our readers should know about the FELIX Society,\nwhich aims to help the Editor with the production of the paper, by way\nof advice and feedback. The production of FELIX is a complex\nmatter; not only on the technical side, viz.proofreading, pasting-up\nand collating, but also in decisions as to which copy or material to\ninclude, where to go for information and news, and how to achieve a well-balanced and attractively presented newspaper. And that's where the FELIX Society comes in, to give a helping hand. Started by\nlast year's Editor, the Society is now fully operational, with a full\ncommittee and a growing membership. The committee is organized\nso as to deal with most major areas of FELIX; members being\ndelegated to deal with news, photography, finances, sports, reviews\nand lias on between the other media at IC and is responsible to the\nPublications Board of the Union; co-ordination is definitely a major\nissue. Whilst major decisions on content must rest with the Editor,\nthe Society can recommend inclusion, omission or amendment of\nmaterial requested by readers and has proved its usefulness in giving\nthe Editor time to include important features such as editorials, U GM reports, etc. Next term's meetings, which you are ALL welcome to\nattend,should be hot stuff indeed.so if you are interested.GO to the\nFELIX Office and either drag the Editor (Colin) out from under his\npaste ups and talk to him or me.\nLars Wernberg-Moller\nSir\nI have made serious consideration of Simon Jerome's recent\nletter advocating compulsory\nindustrial experience between\nschool and university.\nI agree that a 'year out' is usually\na good idea. I would suggest that a total break from academic work is\nunwise, while day release courses at local technical colleges my not be particularly\ninstructive either.\nMy main criticism, however, of\nMr Jerome's letter, regards his\nsuggestion that working in\nindustry makes you appreciate\nuniversity more. Unfortunately, in\nmy case the reverse is true. Quite\napart from the specialized problems that IC students endure\nto get a degree, I would probably\nbe irritated an any university by\nliving on an essentially fixed\nincome, by mixing with an essentially narrow band of\nsociety (students) and by having a large academic workload.\nYours until G Day\nKen Strachan\nDear Editor\nProf Bremsstrahlung has asked\nme to write to you about a most\ngrave and disturbing matter.\nLast week, two and a half years\nafter his retirement from FELIX,\nhe was astounded to read that you\nare reissuing his biography for\nsale to the public without\nnotifying him first. The Professor\nwishes to remind you that\nalthough many FELIX readers\nmay not remember him, he has\nkept himself well occupied forcing back the frontiers of\nknowle ge, fully justifying his\ncontinuing status as the most\nbrilliant intellect this side of the\nBig Bang. Such an intellect is not\nto be treated in such an offhand\nand contemptuous manner. Even\nworse, the Professor's good friend\nand colleague, Mr Tony Jones, is\nin a severe state of shock after the\nnews was broken to hm by a scruffy urchin in a lift.\nI can now reveal to you that the\nProfessor was intent on releasing\nthe contents of his genetic\nmanipulation laboratory into your\npremises, but that I managed to\npersuade hm to desist from this\nprecipitous action on the grounds\nthat the proceeds from the sale of\nthe book will go to a more\ndeserving cause than your good\nself. In the circumstances, the\nProfessor will be satisfied with a grovelling apology. '\nYours faithfully\nQuark\nChief Assistant to Prof Bremsstrahlung\nDear ICU\nI hope you are aware that last\nnight the School of Mines had a strip show in the Union S CR. Many people object to this type of\n'entertainment'.\nIt encourages men to look at\nwomen only as objects for their\namusement, however women are\nreal people with minds and\npersonalities. Strip shows attempt\nto suppress any recognition of\nthis fact, they instead seek to\nshow that a woman's physical\nappearance is the only important\nthing and thus serve the exploitation of women.\nPresenting women as objects\nfor the amusement of men\nencourages men to look upon\nwomen as their property, women's bodies to be used at will,\nthe awful conclusion of this state\nof mind being rape, a most violent\nviolation of women's rights.\nIt is time we questioned whether\nUnion facilities should be used in\nthis way.\nLucy Scott\nMaths 1\nDear Colin\nI would like to take this\nopportunity to thank all members\nof IC Volleyball team for giving up\ntheir time and (some of) their\nenergy to play for Imperial.\nAlthough at the start of the term\nwe lost the first three matches,\nonce a team framework was\nestablished we pulled off four\nconsecutive wins, one of which\nwas against UL U, and therefore\nvery satisfying.\nThanks go to Suki, Dave, Andy,\nMarek, Lech, Henry, Peter, Bo,\nTony, Chris, Alexis and Tarn for\nconstantly turning out and playing to win (on occasion).\nThanks also to the other\nmembers of Volleyball Club,\nparticularly Sheilagh and Diane of\nIF and Judith, all of whom began\nplaying for the first time this term,\nand are rapidly improving I should\nalso mention Vic for supporting\nus, and Carolyn for cheerleading, writing reports, cups of coffee etc.\nAnyway, Happy Christmas to\neveryone, and remember that we\nhave two hard matches at the start\nof next term, so easy on the mice\npies! Volleyball Club meet in the\nUnion Gym on Wednesdays\nbetween 3:00-6:00pm and on\nSundays between 12:00-3:00pm. New members always welcome.\nMary Young\nCaptain, IC Volleyball Club\nDear Sir,\nWe find it disturbing that articles\nshould be submitted for printing in\nFELIX that contain errors which\nmight surely have been corrected\nwith a little more time and effort on\nthe part of the author.Being involved\nin the production of FELIX this\nweek,our wrath was aroused by one\nexceedingly long article which made\nus question our faith in the ability of\nour contributors to write with brevity\nor even inspiration.May Santa Claus\nbe more liberal with gifts of articles of\na less turgid composition for the\ncoming year.\nYours, L. Wernberg - Moller\nD. Crabbe D. Everett\nDear Colin\nI am writing in reply to Mr Hodgson's letter (issue 537)\nconcerning the advertising in last\nyear's Rag Mag. As Advertising\nManager last year, I do not feel that\nthe real problem has been given\nmuch consideration. The root of the\nproblem is that we are in London and\nbecause of this comparisons\nbetween the advertising in our mag\nand in two from provincial\nuniversities are not possible.\nMost colleges have their Rag\nMags printed by Mcmillan and\nGraham who do not charge for the\nprinting but take in all the advertising\nrevenue (and make a healthy profit\nfrom it). However, they will not\nobtain advertising for any London\ncollege, presumably because they\nrealise the difficulties involved in\ngetting advertising in London.\nLast year I sent out rate cards to\nabout one hundred and twenty firms\nand received less than ten replies,\nmost of which were negative.\nIn most cities, the students form an\nintegral part of the community, but\nin London there are so many\ndifferent colleges that shops are not\nprepared to advertise for one\nparticular college. Mo and I went\nround a lot of local shops (on High St\nKen, Gloucester Rd, Knightsbridge\nand Old Brompton Rd) and obtained\nfour adverts. This was due partly to\nthe general lack of interest in\nadvertising and, to a large extent, to\nthe number of chain stores we found.\nOne final point is that last year the\nadvertising did not start until\nJune/July, whereas this year the Rag\nCommittee should be electing the\nAdvertising Manager at the first\nmeeting next term. In fact, Mr Marshall tells me that he will be\ndefinitely proposing Mr Hodgson as\nAdvertising Manager of the next Rag\nMag at this meeting.\nYours sincerely\nTansy Hepton\nDear Sir\nI apologise to the individuals\nabout whom I made uncomplimentary remarks in my last letter.\nTheir amusing reply puts me to\nshame. Secondly, I want to\namplify my remark concerning\naffiliation to political groups.\nUnder the present system of\nautomatic membership student\nunions are funded directly by the\ntaxpayer. Hence, union funds\nshould only be used for the\npurpose for which they are given,\nnamely, promoting the well-being\nof students. Students are rightly\nconcerned with political issues\nbut a student union should not\nsupport, using taxpayer's money,\norganisations that are not\nprincipally concerned with\nstudents' interests.\nDisgusted\n2\n\n"

    "content": "S)P DAY BY DAY\nWEDNESDAY 5\nNUCLEAR POWER PLAN\nThe building of at least one controversial\nAmerican-style press uri sed water nuclear power\nstation has been approved by a cabinet\ncommittee. According to the minutes of the\nmeeting this will be \"subject to satisfactory safety\nclearances being obtained\". Sizewell in Suffolk is\nthe favoured site for the PWR reactor,\nconstruction of which would begin in 1982.\nRHODESIA CEASEFIRE PLAN\nThe deadlock on the ceasefire plan for\nRhodesia was broken when the PF were given\nassurances that the Rhodesian airforce will be\nkept in check and disarmed, that the\nCommonwealth monitoring will be large enough\nto do the job and that South Africa will be asked to\nkeep out of Rhodesia during the ceasefire and\nelections. The final task is working out the military\nlogistics to implement the plan, which could take\na week.\nMINERS ACCEPT20% DEAL\nOver fifty-one percent of the miners voted\nagainst their executive's advice in an 87% poll and\naccepted the National Coal Boards. The PM told\na parliamentary lunch that she was heartened by\nthe result which was one of the signs that her\nphilosophy and beliefs were in accord with those\nof ordinary people.\nTHURSDAY 6\nCIVIL SERVICE JOBS TOGO The Lord President of the Council announced\nthat 40,000 Civil Service jobs are to be axed over\nthe next three years. These cuts, which will save\n\u00a3212 million a year, are in addition to the 20,000\njobs lost by the three-month ban on Civil Service\nrecruiting after the General Election.\nBritish Steel, who are also cutting jobs,\nannounced that the 2,400 workforce at the River\nDon Plant, Sheffield is to be reduced by 400.\nNUCLEAR PLAN LEAK\nThe Prime Minister has ordered a Government\ninquiry into the leak of a Cabinet paper about the\nsiting of a nuclear power station. The paper\nrevealed that the Goverment has approved the\nbuilding of at least one press uri sed water (PWR)\nnuclear power station. The paper, which was\npublished in the press, also states that they\nshould keep a low profile over the programme to\nminimize the expected opposition from anti\nnuclear protesters.\nINCREASE IN VIOLENT CRIME\nHome Office figures reveal that violence\nagains.t the person in the first three quarters of the\nyear rose by ten per cent compared with the same\nperiod last year. Criminal damage offices have\nincreased by three per cent. However, offences of\nrobberies, burglaries, theft and fraud show a decrease \u2014 robberies showing a seven per cent\ndecrease.\nFRIDAY 7\nNATIONAL STEEL STRIKE\nAn all-out national steel strike was called from\n2nd January by leaders of th 90,000 British Steel\nCon workers in protest at the pay offer of 2%\nmade earlier this week. This will be the first\nnational strike in the steel industry since the\nGeneral Strike in 1926. the decision was\ndescribed as a 'tragedy' by the BSC Chairman\nand he said that the only winners would be foreign\nsteel makers. BRITAIN OUT' CALL Demands by the Irish Republic for a British\ncommitment to withdraw from Ulster are\nexpected soon. This follows the election of Mr\nCharles Haughey as Prime Minister designate\nand iea der of the ruling Fianna Fail party. Mr\nHaughey said he stuck by his party's policy on\nUlster which began with a de cie ration that \"we\nwant to bring about unification\".\nSATURDAY 8\nNEAR MISS FOR CONCORDE The USAF admitted that on 30th October a formation of its fighters on a refuelling exercise\nmissed collision with an Air France Concorde by\nmilliseconds, the near disaster was the fault of the\nUSAF traffic controllers who did not warn the\nUSAF pilots that a Concorde was flying in a20 mile wide cor rider between two forbidden military\nair zones. The lead plane in the formation of four\nF15s missed the underside of the Concorde's nose by just ten feet and the second plane missed\nConcorde's cockpit by 15 feet.\nNATO MOVE\nThe four big powers in Nato \u2014 American,\nBritain, Germany and Italy \u2014 are to press ahead\nwith their decision to build and install new\nmedium-range nuclear missiles, despite growing\nopposition among their smaller allies. They plan\nto build 572 missiles with nuclear warheads at a cost of \u00a34,000 million to be spread through\nWestern Europe. The Russian's have warned that\nthere would be no disarmament talks if the Nato\nmissile programme went ahead.\nJACK SOLOMONS DIES\nJack Solomons, who rose from being a fishmonger in the East End to become Britain's top boxing promoter died today, aged 77. During\nhis career he promoted 26 world title fights. He\nwas closely associated with Randolph Turpin,\nFreddie Mill, Bruce Woodcock and many other\nboxing headline-makers of the 1950s. MONDAY 10\nEND OF SMALLPOX\nA17 nation commission of the World Health\nOrganization in Geneva concluded that smallpox\nhas been totally eradicated. They recommended\nthat all vaccination against the disease should be\nabolished, although 200 million doses of vaccine\nare to be kept. Research is now only to continue\nin four centres, one of which is St Mary's Hospital,\nPaddington.\nSPANISH CONCUBINES\nMr Bias Pinar, the leader of the Spanish Fuerza\nNueva party received loud cheers from his blue-shirted fac is t followers, when he suggested\nconcubinage as a solution to marital problems in\nSpain, where divorce is not permitted. Some of\nhis female followers, however, were less\nenthusiastic although one admitted that\n\"concubinage is hardly new here in Soai:;\".\nTUESDAY 11\nBSC CUTS 52,000 JOBS\nBritish Steel is to cut 52,000 jobs in its efforts to\nim Drove productivity and bring capacity in line\nwith demand. By next August the work force w: be reduced to 100,000. The cut-back is the big ges. than any nationalised industry has ever had to\nendure. BSC was warned by Mr Sims, General\nSecretary of the Iron and Steel Trades\nConfederation, the largest union in the industry,\nthat it could expect 'mass trade union action'.\nSUNDAY 9\nCEASEFIRE IN DOUBT\nThe weekend raids by Rhodesian ground and\nair forces into Zambia and Mozambique against\nbases occupied by the guerillas of the PF. have\nthrown doubts over the conclusion of an early\nceasefire at the Lancaster House conference\nThe reaction of the PF was bitter and the twin\noperations by troops of General Walls were\ndescribed as 'outrageous' especially as the\nGeneral was a key figure in ceasefire negotiations.\nKHOMEINI' S FOLLOWERS RIVALS\nFive people were killed in fighting between the\nsupporters of Iran's two most powerful religious\nleaders for control of the broadcasting station a! Tabiz. The fighting was between the followers of\nAyatollah Khomeini and Ayatollah Kazem\nShariatmadian.\nSOAMES OFF TO RHODESIA\nDespite anxious protests from the opposition\nthe Government launched the fuel stage of the\nRhodesian gamble by sending Lord Soames to\ntake up his duties as Governor of the revived\ncolony of Southern Rhodesia, even before the PF\nleaders had accepted the final\"terms of the\nceasefire proposals. Lord Soames will be met by\nBishop Muzorewa, the outgoing PM, who has\nacknowledged that all legal powers rest with\nBritain. He will face demands from the PF to\nabolish by decree all legislation restricting their\nactivities including ail emergency powers\nintroduced in 1965.\nFEES RISE MAY SHUT THREE\nLONDON COLLEGES Lord Annan, London University s ViceChancellor, warned that it faces redundancies\nand closures of three colleges because of\ngovernment spending cuts. In a letter to the\nUniversity Grants Committee he appeals for t ne university to be made a special case for funds t; ease it's 'specially disastrous plight'. This ha^\nbeen caused by the Government's plan to cu*\nfinance to universities in direct proportion to\nnumbers of overseas students they admit and so\nforce them to charge 'full-cost fees'.\n11\n\n"

The lecture will be given by Sir Mark\nTurner, Chairman and Chief Executive of Rio Tinto Zinc\nCorporation Ltd, on Monday 14 January 1980 at 6:00pm in the Mining Lecture Theatre at the Royal School of\nMines, South Kensington, London SW 7. The lecture\nwill be on the topic of International British-based\nCompanies in a Nationalistic World. All are cordially\ninvited to attend.\nOVERSEAS STUDENTS\nAsset or Liability? By the time you read this IC Committee\non Overseas Students will have had its\nsecond meeting of this session. At the last\nmeeting, IC Union was represented by\nAftab Gujral and Mick Berry and topics\nincluded allocation of Hall places to\noverseas postgraduates (at present 10%),\nthe TOEFL test (Teaching Of English as a Foreign Language) and the successful\nIntroductory Arrangements (in future to\ninclude lias on with Michael Arthur, Union\nWelfare Adviser).\n\" A SUBSIDY TO BRITAIN\"\nAny campaign against the government's proposed reduction in grants to universities\n(eg for IC, from \u00a322.37 million now to \u00a317.29\nmillion in 1983-84 \u2014 the latter figure \u2014\nincluding no fees for overseas students \u2014\nmoney those students will presumably have\nto find themselves) must urge a broad\nviewpoint if it is to carry any weight. As Lord\nBullock points out in a recent letter to the\nObserver \"there should at least be an\nattempt to analyse the advantages, as well\nas the costs\" of the presence of overseas\nstudents, especially postgraduates at British\nuniversities. The benefits of unpaid research\nwork and to international trade (with\nBritish-educated students returning home\nand maintaining links with British industry\nand its modus operand i) are obviously more\ndifficult to evaluate than costs of running\ncourses and maintaining establishments,\nbut without them we only have half the\npicture. Indeed the British educational\nsystem would have to be paid for even if we\nsent all overseas students home, and many\nadvanced courses would have to close, and\nlevels of academic and cultural stimulation\nfall as a result.\nThe Government seems to have dropped\nthe 'Full Economic Cost' line (and\nunderstandably so!) but the fictitious \u00a3100\nmillion subsidy paid by taxpayers towards\ndegree courses for foreigners seems to have\nreplaced it and last month the Telegraph\nquoted this, though the underlying\ncalculation is far from clear.\nEven if one is opposed to granting\noverseas aid, the present government's policy towards overseas students makes\neconomic nonsense. The most charitable\nthing that can be said is that it hasn't been\nthought through fully. Previous Conservative leaders would surely have\nconsidered such unpleasant discrimination\n\"un-British\". As Lord Flowers said on\nCommemoration Day: \"It makes our\npartnership in Europe much harder to\nachieve It impoverishes our society. It\nis wrong.\"\nAll overseas students entering British\nuniversities in 1980 will face minimum fees of\n\u00a32,000 (arts courses) and \u00a33,000 (science\ncourses) excluding all accommodation and\nliving costs. As you go home for Christmas\nreflect that saying \"Happy Christmas\" to an\noverseas student at IC may be impossible by\nChristmas 1985 \u2014 there would not be any\nand Britain would be poorer economically,\nintellectually and culturally.\nMick Berry\nOverseas students at the Mayor's reception.

So our first race in\nthe Novice Regatta (which was only for\npeople who started rowing this term) was\nagainst Reading University. In this race,\nwhich was not our greatest achievement, we\nshowed Reading what seven men rowing is all\nabout. After about fifty strokes we were about\none length down, this was too much for Stuart\nwho decided to swim it. After a spectacular\n'Crab' he found himself ejected from the boat\nand as we swept oas t him he was smacked on\nthe head by Pete Mance's(\"I thought he was\na swan\") blade. Exit main competition.\nHowever all was not lost (yet), we were now\neligible for the plate (a competition for first'\ntime losers). After a compete rethink of our\nstrategy (we decided to lower the rating and\nlengthen the stroke by opening out the angle.\nTechnical!), we were ready for the first round.\nIn this we ably showed the inferiority of the\nWelsh by thrashing Cardiff University with\nthe ample margin of three feet!\nWe were now in the semi-finals! Our\nopponents, the Royal Military College of\nScience, Shrivenham, never really stood a chance. After racing the whole course side by\nside we won comfortably.\nSo to the final. After a very close race we\nwere narrowly beaten by Jesus (\"We only row\nfive days a week \u2014 we walk on water\")\nCollege, Cambridge by one length.\nThe indomitable Novice crew were: P Tebbutt, J Vedy, S Allinson, A Purdy, R Redhead, J Marsden, P Maince, M Agnew and\nS Crampton.\nGLIDING Despite poor weather I CGC has had an\nexcellent year with eight new cross-country\npilots completing silver distance (50km), Pete\nReading attaining diamond g> al (300km triangle) in the Club Libelle, and Phil Guthrie\nattaining much embarrassment (280km in the\nAstir on the same day!)-The Easter course was highly successful\nwith everyone on it going solo by the end,\nthough perhaps the same cannot quite be\nsaid of the Long Mynd expedition. Suffice to\nsay that the Astir is recovering nicely after an\nargument with a fence, and should be flying\nagain by the New Year. However, some\ninteresting 'wave' and 'ridge' soaring was\nachieved before the accident, and afterwards\ndue entirely to the generosity of the Midland\nGliding Club, who let us fly their machines.\nNow with the onset of winter it's back to^\noverhauling the gliders ready for next\nsummer \u2014 yes, those bits of fibre glass in the\nAero basement really fly!\nIf you've got this far, are still reading and\naren't yet a member, then you're obviously a natural glider pilot. Why not come along to\none of our meetings and find out? Training\ncontinues throughout the winter and for\naround eight pounds you can get down to\nLasham one weekend and have a fly round\nand that in clu aes social membership, a flight\ntransport and accommodation \u2014 all you need\nis a sleeping bag.\nWe meet at 5:30pm in Aero 254 every\n' Thursday.\nChris Starkey EE3\nWe also had one ladies crew entered in this\nevent \u2014 the ladies competition that is. In their\nfirst race, they took on the might of the\nBillygoats (Fitzwilliam College, Cambridge\nfor those of you who didn't know) and won by\nabout two lengths. This put them in the semi-final, where again they had Cambridge\nopposition, this time from Churchill College.\nThey led for the first part of the race, but they\ncould not hold off Churchill's challenge over\nthe second half of the race and lost by about\none length.\nAfter four races in four hours the\nsympathetic reader will realise we needed\nsomething that refreshes the parts that a certain lager doesn't! Consequently we went\nback along the A4 (because there aren't any\npubs on the M4) and although we missed Dr\nWho, I don't think anyone really minded.\nNow for the plug! If Ithere are any of you out\n- there who would like to have a go, take the\nplunge (sorry about that one!) and come\ndown to the Boathouse on the first\nWednesday afternoon of next term and find\nout what it's all about. It's just along the\nEmbankment from Putney Bridge, on the\nsouth side of the Thames; you can get there\nby tube or number 14 bus (from the tube\nstation at South Ken).\nSteve Crampton\nIC 4th s REACH SEMIFINAL OF\nCUP\nOn Saturday, IC 4th s faced their toughest\ntest yet in the cup against AMC3 rds. A side\nwho are not only in the division above us but\nwho also knocked out IC 3rds in the last\nround.\nQM C got off to a shock start by scoring in\nthe first five minutes but this only helped IC to\nadapt to the tighter game and come back at\nthem fiercely. Twenty minutes of intensive\npressure mainly inspired by some superb\nplay by Richard Dolan rocked the QM C defence bringing some fine saves from their\nkeeper. Desperation soon showed in Q MC's play, ruthlessly bringing down any of our\nforwards who got near the ball. Then the\nbreakthrough came when Andy Hartland\nfinished Richards fine approach work by\nrifling a superb low shot wide ofthe keeper's full-stretch dive. The game proceeded at a furious pace.\nThe second half continued much the same\ntill Andy struck again squeezing the ball in\nbetween keeper and post. IC looked poised to\ntake firm control of the game till a surprised\ngoal was def elected past Steve Veats from an\nuncharacteristic loose ball from the corner.\nThe next five minutes were very shaky for IC\nwith Steve Veats making two fine saves from\nforwards who were clear through. At about\nthis time Paul Galvin, whose j in king 'Barnes'\nlike play on the right got him regularly\nflattened by the definitely nasty QM C defence was squashed by the hairiest\nleft back in the country. He later had to come\ntired of wandering round in ever tightening\ncircles wondering what century he was in.\nConsequently superb sub Dave Brannan had\nto come on and add his own exciting brand of\nexhaustion to the team for the last ten\nminutes. This move coincided with Andy\nbecoming 'Hatrick' Hartland and putting IC\nahead 3-2 and taking their rightful place in the\nsemi-finals. This was a fantastic team\nperformance and everyone in the side\ndeserves credit. However, last words must go\nto Steve Kaye's dramatic (even traumatic)\nsixty yards run down the left wing beating at\nIS THERE NO STOPPING THEM?\nIC Volleyball reached new heights of\nsuccess this week when they beat the team\nfrom West London College of Further\nEducation on their home ground at Osterley\non Tuesday 4th December. We (the\nsupporters) all thought that the score was\ngoing to be really impressive when the first\ntwo sets were won, 17-15 and 15-10 by the IC\nteam, but this thought was soon shattered\nwhen the next two sets were dropped 2-15,\n14- 16 during the final set we shouted\nourselves hoarse cheering the team on to a1513 victory which will give us five more\nvaluable points in the 'Seetech' League.\nEvery member of the team deserved\ncongratulations for playing well both\nindividually and as a team, especially Chris\nWa ch nicki, whose general play was\nexceptional and Henrey Szyszko and Andy\nCiuksza who were both 'spiking' very well.\nAlso a special mention to Tam and Marc for\ncoming along even if they did not get the\nchance to prove how good they are!\nThe team comprised: M Banasiak, L Bogdanowicz, A Ciuksza, P Diaz-Lalcaca, B Hermansson, D Penty (Capt on court), S Tam, H Szyszko, C Wachnicki and M Young.\nCarolyn Wainwright\nTeam mascot\n~ \" FOOTBALL least five players and leaving QM C grateful\nthat he was playing at left back.\nTeam: Steve Veats, Neil Morris, Steve Kaye,\nNeil Redmayne, Dave Griffiths, Damian\nNnochiri, Paul Galvin, Steve Sims, Richard\nDolan, Ramsey Hawa, Andy Hartland and\nDave Brannan.\nSECONDS IN SEMI-FINALS\nAt 12:30pm on Saturday 8th November, the\nheroes ofthe IC 2nd XI began to converge on\nthe Union Lower Lounge. On arrival it was\nobvious there were two sorts of players.\nThere were the quiet, sober, well-behaved\ngentlemen such as Al Betts, Brian Scannell\nand Giles Brereton, who had sensibly had a quiet Friday evening in, as a suitable\npre part ation for this important quarter-final\ngame. The other sort was typified by Phil\nNiccolls, who staggered in, with the help of\nKevin Buckley and Andy Haralampous\nbemoaning the fact that he had lost all\nrecollections of the previous evening's 'one\ngarment' party (I won't mention the 'lure x' body stocking, Phil!) and staunchly denying\nhe had only worn a smile!\nThe whole team assembled and carried out\nthe time-honoured IC tradition of waiting\nhalf-an-hour for Capitol Coaches to turn up\nOn eventual arrival at Harlington, the\nusual pre-match ceremonies were performed\n(notice how I avoid giving details!) and IC 2nd XI took to the field.\nAt full-time IC had won by two goals from\nKevin Buckley and Phil Niccolls. Rumour has\nit that Andy Haralampous hit the bar (cross-bar!) and Julian Gamble cleared off the line.\nThree jugs, one shower and one of Arthur's teas later (not necessarily in that order!) six of\nus realised we had missed the last coach back\nto College! The five travelled by tube, while\nBarry (I 've got two crutches!) Hatton got a lift.\nBack at the Union celebrations continued.\nThe team: Al Betts, Jim Beer, Julian\nGamble, Declan McGuckin, Goldilocks\nBrereton, Brian Scannell, Dave Dean and\nJames Rowley.\nYours libellous ly Giles Brereton\n12\n\n"

    "content": "EDITORIAL\nThere is no end, no beginning just new\ncalendars taking the place of those that indicated\nthe passing of the seventies. On into the eighties\nspins the earth \u2022 a space ship hurtling through\nspace slowly being polluted and no-one knowing\nwhere it's going.\nEnough of complex imagery .... I 'll leave that to\nthe FELIX fiction writers. We have the good\nfortune to know where we're heading (at least in\nthe short term). Most of you will be going home,\nthis weekend, back to your family life sharing\nChristmas with your friends and relatives.\nAt this point I would like to welcome a new\nreader to FELIX - the British Prime Minister, Mrs\nThatcher. If I wanted to be political I could write al\nlength about the cuts but that would be taking\nadvantage of 10 Downing Street's current interest\nin FELIX. The leader of the Conservative\nGovernment must be aware that she is losing the\nstudent vote but we don't remain students for\nlong! I believe cuts can be beneficial if they only\nstop wastage and if the enforced discussions and\nmodifications produce a more efficient system.\nHowever, if cuts restrict development and r reale stagnation then they must be condemned.\nWithin the last few weeks an important new\nclub has been formed al Imperial. The\nMicrocomputer club has emerged rather late\nconsidering that we are one of the foremost\nUniversities of Science and Technology in Ihe\nUK. The importance of hands-on experience of\nmicro-processors is clear to everyone who has\ndab led in computing. I have pledged my help to\ngive the club a hand during their early\ndevelopment but the signs are thai interest is\nlikely to snowball as we begin to try to cope with\nthe micro-processor 19R0s. Large mainframes will become strange\nmuseum pieces like, their parents, the valve\ncalculators of the fifties. It was a shock to see a micro simulating a game of space invaders. The\nwhole package was just sitting at the end ol a table\nin the Lower Refectory. The program had been\nwritten in a mere five hours.\nImperial students may be able to understand\nthe workings of the latest computers but coping\nwith human beings could become difficult as we\nspend more time with machines that to some\nextent are becomming human substitutes.\nTHE GETAWAY\nSteve McQueen, AliMcGraw, Sam Peckinpah;\nlow brow entertainment but never a dull moment.\nOn general re release this month, this film bears\nthe unmistakable stamp of Peckinpah, with slow\nmotion death scenes and some excellent\nphotography; Ali McGraw never looked so lovely\nas when she made her exit from a refuse truck.\nBeginning with a sequence of shots, each\nabruptly frozen after a few seconds, the film\nrevolves around the progress of Doc McCoy\n(Steve McQueen) as he blasts his way across the\nUSA, accompanied by wife Carol (Ali McGraw)\nafter a bank raid he has carried out, his side of the\nPlaying a solo game against a machine is often\naddictive. Gone are the days when nearly all\nstudents played card games to pass the time ....\nthere are only four years to go to 1984!\nHaving managed to get the editorial around to\nmentioning the social lives of students I will now\nbegin a con travers i al discussion on the role of\nICWA (Imperial College Women's Association).\nAt the start of next term it is strongly rumoured\nthat a motion will be put to aUG M which, if\npassed, would effectively destroy ICWA. I hope\nthat the pages of the first FELIX of the eighties will\ncontain contributions from both sides of the\nICWA debate. As Editor of FELIX I have to\ndecided to print my own views to start the debate:\n1: ICWA needs to change .... any organisation\nisn't perfect and so change in the right direction\nis always for the best. The question that has\nto be answered is how the change should take\nplace and what will be the end result.\n2: ICWA could be disbanded. If so we must decide\nwhat should replace it or whether it needs to be\nreplaced. Has it outlived its initial purpose?\nAt the end of the debate YOU will be given the\nchance to vote at aUG M. Merche Clarke has written on page four of this\nnewspaper that if there is a question of change in\nICWA then it is ICWA who should decide and be\ninvolved in any discussion. Every female student\nat Imperial is a member of ICWA and I have not\nconsidered the arguments without consulting\nseveral members of ICWA.\nI note that there are few occasions where girls\nat Imperial have the opportunity to meet in a large\ngroup. FELIX has given extensive coverage to the\nLadies Rugby team. Involvement in women's rugby is one of the rare chances for girls at IC to\nbe involved in an activity which is their own.\nICWA does organise events purely for women\nand some where men are invited as well e.g. the\nICWA Ball. However, I am certain that there is a need for more events regularly each week. More\nevents mean that more people would have to\nhelp with the organisation. That brings me to the\ncriticism of ICWA i.e. not enough people get\ninvolved. It is easy to say that ICWA should be\nabolished because few are interested, but there is\na good chance that with radical change ICWA\ncould quickly become an Association that plays a the bargain with a politician who has arranged his\nprison parole. Several people are gratuitously\nkilled, and car-chases abound.\nFor all his neat tricks, McCoy loses faith in\nCarol, after she guns down the politician and a theme of doubts and chances taken is quite subtly\nintroduced. There is a nice touch in the film,\nwhere McQueen does a car-stunt and actually\ngets it wrong; long live the human factor.\nUnfortunately for the film as a whole, there is a happy ending, but all in all, if you don't wince at\nthe idea of Steve McQueen saying What seems to\nbe the problem, Officer?, at a roadblock, then I can guarantee you'll enjoy yourselves.\nLars Wernberg-Moller\nmajor part in life at IC. A new Society would take\nat least a year to get going. ICWA has the ability to\nbe able to reach full potential faster than a completely new Society.\nGirls need help on a wide range of topics.\nICWA can play a major role in the welfare of a woman Imperial.Advice on contraception e.g. The advantages of Low Oestrogen Pills when\nconsidering the side effects of being on the Pill.\nAdvice to Freshers on how to cope with the\nmultitude of problems that crop up during their\nfirst year. The Fresher can benefit from the\nexperience gained by Second and Third year\nstudents. ICWA events are ideal for encouraging\ninformal discussion that might not be started in a more formal environment.\nMale students can only benefit from a strong\nwomen's organisation. More girls will be\nencouraged to come to Imperial and when they\narrive they stand a better chance of being happy\nhere if they have the support of a well organised\nwomen's association.\nOnce the year is underway it is difficult to meet\nnew people. A lot of students waste their 'social'\ntime. Men and women can be trapped in the\nsearch for unreachable goals.\nI believe that ICWA can help the Fresher\nshorten the period when she learns about\nImperial. ICWA could be one of the important\naids to women at IC.\nYOU will be given the chance to influence the\nlive of students in the 1980s. By writing to FELIX\nthe ICWA debate can be thrashed out before the\nfrantic discussions at the next U GM. If you're still reading this Editorial then you\ndeserve an extra special medal for per server ance. I must close by thanking everyone that has helped\nproduce FELIX this term. Few realise the long\nhours that have to be put in to bring you FELIX. It\nis quite usual for me to get up on a Monday and\nnot return to my Linstead hall room until Friday\nafternoon (there are always chances of taking\nshort FELIX cat-naps during the long nights).\nOK that's my job but dozens of students, studying\nfor degrees, give many hours to help me get\nFELIX pasted up and collated. As I sit at the\nFELIX computer typesetter my digital watch says\nthat its 6:10 a.m. For most of the night there have\nbeen a least half a dozen students working in the\noffice. Soon the sun will be rising heralding the\nstart of another Thursday at Imperial.\nI still need more help. Everyone is welcome to\njoin the FELIX Society. FELIX is your newspaper.\nIf you think we can make specific improvements\nthen either help us carry them out or at least pop\nin for a chat.\nHave a great Christmas. Enjoy your brief\nrespite from the pressures of Imperial.\nColin Palmer (FELIX Editor)\nWHAT'SON FRI 14 DEC: IC Christian Union Fellowship Evening at 6:30pm in the Music Room,53 Princes Gate.

'Gorrunnghhf was my first reaction, as I stood there , desperately trying to gain an\noverall view of my body in the mirror, between\nthe large spaces where the reflective coating\nhad disappeared altogether. Then as the idea\nappealed to me more, and I attempted to\nremove a layer of oily substance from my\ntongue, I thought 'Mmmrrmghaa'.\nAs I teetered dangerously on the platform of\nthe District Line, only inches away from high -voltage death, I mused that Archangel,\nRussia, is one ofthe coldest places on earth.

Hit Squad\nhit Carnaby Street with one slight\ndifference, they got the public to hit\nthemselves for a small donation, Chem Eng\n1 must be hit mad: Ruth collected \u00a3161 all by\nherself and others got more than \u00a3100 each.\nMany thanks to all those who collected.\nAlso on the Rag front, carol singing took\nplace with about one hundred and fifty\npeople in Scarf. An onslaught in London\ntook place with Guilds choosing to arrive in\nDowning Street just as Maggie arrived.\nShe was greeted by renderings of a few\ncarols and by a Boomalaka. She gave five\npounds to our collection. It would have been\nmore but the education cuts are starting to\nbite.\nMerry Christmas to you all.\nBryan\nTHE ICWA ARTICLE\nWell, Christmas is here again; turkey and\nXmas pu d, crackers and mince pies \u2014 oh!\nyes those little tart lets of wonder which you\ncan stuff down open gullets, hit the market\nagain and you too can taste some of the\nmost varied offerings in the mince pie\ngendre from ICWA today at lunchtime. As\nan added attraction we have invited some of\nthe College personalities to pit their wits\nagainst one another in a spectacular balloon\ndebate. Each candidate has to pick a woman\nfrom history, eg Frank James has chosen\nMary Summerville (and you can join in too)\nand convince you (the audience) why they\nshould remain in the balloon whilst the\nothers are thrown over board. See you at\none o 'clock in the ICWA Lounge.\nI shall take this opportunity to advertise\nsome of the events we shall be holding next\nterm. The ICWA Lounge will be open all day\nwith books, newspapers (Guardian and\nMirror), magazines (Time Out, Spare Rib\nand Cosmopolitan). For the first couple of\nweeks of term there will be free coffee, tea\nand biscuits with the possibility of music\n(has anyone a tape machine?) and the\nlikelihood (spot the statistician) of lively\nconversation! Bring all your friends and\nhave lunch here. (Has anyone a tape\nmeasure to measure the windows for\ncurtains?)\nThere will be a Women's Bar Night on\nSunday 17th February in the Union Bar so\nlet me have any songs you want to sing and\nwe'll get a song sheet together.\nFollowing a small but enjoyable trip to the\nballet, we shall be arranging other such\nevents so come forward with your\nsuggestions.\nFinally, with respect to certain people\nquestioning the necessity/role/function of\nICWA, we are holding an Open Meeting (it\nis important that as many people as possible\nattend) to discuss The Role Of ICWA on\nTuesday 15th January in the ICWA Lounge.\nIf there is a question of changing ICWA it is\nus who should decide and be involved\nimplicitly in any discussion.\n\n"

After fifteen\nminutes, Guilds President Jo Armitage was challenged by a constable who had apparently\nbeen in consultation with the\nBritish Rail Area Manager.

    "content": "THE OSTERLEY PARK RELAY\nOn Wednesday 5th December, the club\ncompeted in the Osterley Park Relay. The\nrelay is four legs of just over three miles and is\nof a high standard attracting many of the top\nuniversity teams in the country. The level of\ninterest in the relay was raised by the\npresence of Sebastian Coe, using the race in\nhis build-up for the 1980 Olympics.\nThe IC A team in the guise of the UL team,\nwere led off on the first leg by Mark Prickard\nwho showed an excellent turn of speed to\nhand over to Steve Kirk in fourteenth place,\nrecording the fastest time for an IC runner.\nMeanwhile at the front, on the second leg,\nSebastian Coe( Loughboro') had set off in\npursuit of the leading Borough Rd runner,\ncross-country international Dave Clark.\nUnfortunately he lost his shoe, halfway round\nand although he carried on, it ruined his\nchances of taking the fastest time of the day.\nOur very own Steve, also lost his shoe on the\nsecond leg, but being a down-in-the-pocket\nstudent, unable to afford to leave running\nshoes lying around, cool y stopped to tie his\nshoe up, losing four places in the process!\nEvan Cameron, ran a steady third leg to pull\nback four places whilst lan Morton running\nlast leg, gained a couple more places to finish\nthe team in a fine twelfth position.\nSo onto the fortunes of the S and C teams\n(alias the A and 8 teams). Richard Green,\nrunning for the A team, kept things sensible,\nfinishing ahead of Mark Thwaites (8). Then,\non the incident-packed second leg, positions\nswitched, with Richard Seville, on his debut\nrun, gaining no less than twelve places to\nbring the 8 team in, in 29th position, one\nahead of the A team, with Mick Kelly, having a TABLE TENNIS December 5th, remember that date,\nbecause it could go down in the annals of IC\nTable Tennis history as JEFF STE AN DAY. It all began with the Christmas Competition\nwhich I had organised (with handicap\nscores) as a semi-social, semi-serious\nepisode. First of all Jeff defeated a University\nof London first division player without (in the\nthird game) the need of his eight point start.\nThis alone would make most IC team players\nday, but then came the third teams match that\nevening (Jeff is the Captain) and a display of\nsheer dogged 'blood and guts' (pardon the\nvulgarity Snooker Club!).\nBackground info: IC3 equal top of their'\ndivision with INT STUDENTS HOUSE1( their opponents) and having both won all\ntheir matches very easily, this match was\ncrucial to the championship. Also, up to this\nmatch Jeff had a100% winning average (and\nall his opponents were 100% or over 90%).\nAfter losing the first two matches (despite\ngood play by Stanley Wong and Hong-tai\nMan) Jeff's first victory instigated an IC\nrecovery to 4-2. Then, however, Hong-Tai\nplayed a player, who, though not his equal in\nability, responded better to the pressure.\n(Man needed to win the game, to settle the\nmatch.) This left Jeff, facing the only other\nplayer in his league with a100% average prior\nto the match, and needing to win, as the final\nmatch was very unlikely to fall to IC.\nHe pushed, served, looped, smashed,\nblocked and most of all THOUGHT his way to\na great third game 21-19 victory and this\nmeans that IC now have a marvellous chance\nof winning the league championship (barring\nfatal injuries or death).\nThe other league matches were as follows\n(if anything can follow):\nIC1 vs TWA1: 7-2\nbad day. Happily, for Mick things turned out\nbetter in the UL Championships, but on with\nthe relay. By the end of the third leg, the A team were ahead again, with Gary Longhurst\novertaking Chris Smith. Finally to the last leg,\nwhere our guest QE C runner, renowned\noriente er, Hugh Dixon finished the A team in\n26th, whilst Alan Murray had a respectable\nrun for the 8 team finishing them in 32nd position.\nThe relay itself was won by the home team\nBorough Rd, with Loughboro' second and\nBirmingham third, but it was good to see the\nIC team put up one of their best performances\nin a relay, for the last few years.\nUL CHAMPIONSHIPS\nEven without the services of our new\nmarathon star, Mark Pickard, who was\ndisplaying his talents on Wimbledon Common for his club, the IC team hoped to\nretain the team trophy they won last year. Our\nScottish international, Evan Cameron,\ndespite being off-form recently, showed he\ncould still put out a big one when it mattered,\nin winning the individual championship by\nbeing the first student home, though well-beaten into second place overall by a past\nmember of the university who won the race.\nNext runner home, in eighth place, was five\nmillion dollar man (cuts affect us too) Steve\nAustion-Kirk, who, never happy with just one\nrace a day, used this as a warm-up for the\nover-night British Orienteering Championships, only three hours later. Mick Kelly,\nrecently returned from the dead, and looking\nafter the race as though he'd be joining them\nagain soon ran very well to finish in sixteenth\nplace.\nOn Tuesday 4 December IC Water Polo\nClub produced two teams to compete in the\nUL U Knockout. Our first team had a two goal\nhandicap and our second six goals.\nIC2 were the first to play, the score at the\nstart was 6-6, playing against Barts Hospital\n2nd team. We did not start off very well and\nBarts scored a goal to take the lead. Our front\nplayers were very unlucky, Dimitri Papconstantinou's shot hit the crossbar and\nthen the goalkeeper in the head but the ball\ndidn't go in and Adrien Butler hit the goal post\ntwice shooting from in front of the goal, but\nfinally he scored a goal to equalise.\nIn the second half, Barts were completely\nout-played, Nick Ajderian and A ke Wallin\nwere marking tight at the back and did not\ngive them another opportunity to break. Mike\nCasey scored our second goal after breaking\nfrom his man. John Heffernon was passing\nthe ball accurately up front and Bob Bradley\nYes, another excellent win for the firsts\n(also top of their division). Kartick hit a peak\nfor the season, winning all three matches\nsuperbly and Pete and Hong gave solid\ndisplays winning two matches each.\nIC2 vs DAVIES, LAING & DICK: 6-3\nOne good player doesn't make a team as\nD LD found to their cost. All the IC heroes won\ntwo sets.\nIC4 vs NC B3( AWAY): 8-1\nThe slowest table, the hottest room and the\ndeadest bats it has been my misfortune to\nencounter and we still th raped 'em!\nConsidering that, on arriving home, I was\nwrongly accused of stealing half a bottle of\nketchup from a flat mate( and had the other\nhalf thrown all over me!) I am quite pleased I managed an un-nasty report.\nPete Hewkin\nOur valiant Captain, lan Morton, aware that every position was important in the team race\nstruggled to finish in nineteenth place,\ndespite badly pulling a muscle half-way\nround the course. With four of our team, in\nand six to count, it was painful to see our main\nopponents, University College, start packing\ntheir runners in, but four of our own team\nwere fighting it out for the remaining two\nteam places. Alan Murray and Richard Seville\nfinished 29th and 32nd, with Charles de Bono\n33rd and Mark Thwaites 35th helping us to\nwin the event for the second year running.\nWith half the field now finished, there was\ngrowing anxiety over what had happened to\nGary Longhurst, who had not yet completed\none of the two lap course. Unfortunately, he\nnever finished and has not been seen since,\nleaving his distraught girlfriend waiting for\nhim to complete the first lap. Meanwhile,\nFrancis Smith, who had presumably stayed\nwell down the field looking for the missing\nGary, finished near the back in 64th position.\nSpeculation about Gary mounted when at the\nprize-giving, lan limped up to receive six gold\nmedals, one o'f them being for the women's race!\nNow a plea for help. With our two most\nimportant fixtures coming up next term, when\nour top three or four runners are certain to be\nnabbed for the UL U team, it is essential we\nhave a better turn-out for races. The standard\ndoes not need to be high, but this could be\nyour chance to compete alongside Seb Coe at the British Students Championships (with\n600 others!). However, if anyone wants to run\nover a few things with a coach, don't try the\nCross Country Club, apply instead to the\nNation Bus Company to become a driver.\n\" WAT FR POLO\nscored our third goal, positioned in front of\nthe goal. Finally, Bob scored another goal to\nmake the final score 10-7 to us.\nSo IC2 went through to the quarter-finals,\nwhere we were unlucky to play against Guys\nHospital first team, last year's winners of the\ncompetition. Guys were a very fit and\nexperienced team, and despite our efforts\nthey completely dominated the game. We\nstarted off with a60 lead, but they managed\nto produce four goals in the first and three\ngoals in the second half from 'cannon' shots\nto make the final score 6-7, a very close win\nfor them.\nThe team was: B Bradley, M Casey, J Heffernon, A Butler, N Ajderian, A Wallin and\nD Papaconstantinou.\nIC 1 were the next to play, it was a game\nagainst Barts first team, we started off with a20 lead. Dave Dunstone scored the first goal\nfor them (!) when he tried to pass the ball back\nto our goalie Dave Roberts. Our defence was\nrather disorganised, Barts were fast\nswimmers and they always managed to have\na free man up front whenever they were\nattacking. No wonder they managed to score\nseven more goals to go through to the semi-finals, winning by 8-2. A poor result for ICI.\nwho didn't play up to their usual standard.\nThe team: D Roberts, P Mills, P Porter, N Buckland, D Dunstone, N Last and B Ashwin.\nFinally, we played the last games for the\n1979 Middlesex League. IC1 took part in the\n2nd Division with three more teams, and they\nfinished joint first with eight points. IC2 took\npart in the 4th Division with six more teams\nand they managed to finish fourth with ten\npoints. The players of both teams should be\ncongratulated for their excellent performance throughout the year.\nDimitri Papaconstantinou\n13\n\n"

A plethora of gifts\nand frivolities. A festival of Greed (he'd never let greed get in his way before) but\nwhen it came to significance, all this god bit\nreally didn't cut much ice.

    "content": "A Question of Faith By Justin Newland\nThe joyous sound of church bells pealing\nresounded through the winding alleys of the small\nvillage, cheer fu j ly knocking on every door as it\npassed, as if to proclaim the dawn, the coming of\nChristmas. A light fall of snow had decked the\nstreets and rooftops with a mysterious,\ncomfortable glow. The gas-lights flickered lazily\nfrom side to side, swayed by the gentle breeze\nthat had sprung up after the snowfall. A gorgeous\ncalm rested over the country village, set deep\nwithin the bosom of the Black Forest.\nHis gaze fixed wearily to the ground, a man\ntrudged along the deserted streets, oblivious to\nthe Christmas spirit that rang out from every door\nhe passed. His lips, maroon with the cold,\nremained tightly shut: he would not be joining in\nthe hymns this Christmas day. Neither would his\nglove less hands, thrust deep inside his tatty \u2022\novercoat, be pressed together in pious prayer to\nthe Lord.\nBut why? Who was this young soldier with only\nhis shadow for company? And why did this\nsolitary figure divert his eyes to the ground as\nsoon as someone approached?\nThe day before, on Christmas Eve, K \u2014 had\nbeen ignominiously discharged from the Army.\nStripped of rank, honour and self-esteem, the\nshameful humiliation of that day still hounded him\nwhichever way he turned. He had come to his\nhome town to spend Yuletide with his ageing\nparents, but it was the very thought of facing them\nthat filled him with dread. Twice already he had\nreached the door, but had slunk away each time,\ndisgusted with himself.\nHe sought refuge in the warm anonymity of a tavern where he'd spent some time before his\nrecruitment, some nine or ten months before.\nThe familiarity of the rough, oaken pews, the low,\npanelled ceiling and the pungent odour of hops\nrekindled vivid memories of tranquil, untroubled\npast. He thought it was appropriate that he\nshould find himself in this nether-world of drunks\nand thief s. He ordered a cognac, then sat alone in\nthe corner.\nSitting opposite him was a middle-aged man, a most disreputable-looking character wearing a threadbare suit beneath an equally worn\novercoat. To add to his dishevelled appearance,\nthe fellow hadn't shaved for several days, and\nclearly needed a good wash. It wasn't long before\nhe tried to strike up a conversation with K \u2014 , who\nat first just frowned whenever the fellow said\n, anything. But from his accent and speech, K \u2014\nrealised that the man, who by now had embarked\non his life-story, was by no means a tramp. In a voice hoarse with self-pity, he told him that his\noccupation had been Sub-Clerical Officer in the\nlocal government departments. He had a wife,\nthree little children and a home, all waiting\nanxiously for him to return bearing gifts and\nbenedictions, but he wasn't going home. He\ncouldn't. He'd been fired from his job three days\nago, and in a desperate attempt to double his\npaltry earnings, he'd gambled and then drunk\naway the lot. His tiny blue eyes were shiny with\ntears as he told K \u2014 that he couldn't possibly face\nhis consumptive wife and three darlings empty-handed. He'd rather die than see his children\nstarve!\nAs often happens when men, whether they be\nstrangers or not, are brought together under the\nsame troubled roof, these two quickly came to a kind of sympathetic understanding. Cheered\nsomewhat by the velvet warmth of the cognac .\nK \u2014 proceeded to relate to his companion his own\nwoeful tale: one month ago, he'd been arrested\nfor a theft he hadn't committed. The quarters of\none of his commanding officers had been\nransacked and the thief had made off with a princely sum of money.\nThe following day, a thorough search of the\nbarracks revealed the stolen money in K \u2014's belongings. Relieved from guard duty, he'd spent\nthe night in question reading alone in the barracks\nand therefore had no alibi. His insistent\nproclamations of innocence only berated his\nsuperiors all the more; they glibly suggested how\ndignified it would be for K \u2014 to admit his guilt, and\nbe done with it. But despite their threats and\nadvice, he'd maintained his innocence with a stubborn pride.\nFor three weeks, he'd festered in the Army\ndungeons, racking his brains to think who had\nplanted the money in his chest. He swore on his\nparents' lives that if he ever caught up with the\nbrigand, he'd chop off his hand. Finally, on\nChristmas Eve, the travesty of justice was\ncompleted: he'd been court-martialled.\nThe identity of the criminal would have\nastonished him. Thinking that the truth is always\nhidden in the shadows far from our view, we\nscour the distant horizons and beyond\nforgetting to look at what is nearest. For\nunbeknown to K \u2014 , his best friend in the Army\nhad been the agent of his misfortune. The motive\nfor the theft, unlike the deed itself, had been\ndecidedly honourable; L \u2014 had wanted to give his\nelderly parents a bountiful Christmas, and had\nsuccumbed to temptation with this noble\nintention in mind. L \u2014 had carefully concealed the\nbooty in his friend's chest without either his\nknowle ge or consent: he had thought to leave it\nthere until their Christmas leave, but to the\ncal amato us results we have described above.\nAt any rate, by this time K \u2014's eager listener\nhad fallen asleep. With his conscience\nunburdened by confession, K \u2014 took his leave\nand soon found himself outside the door of his\nparents' house.\nWhat had he to fear from then, anyway? He\nwas innocent, or was he? He'd been found guilty\nof theft and dishonour ably discharged from the\nArmy. Yes, these were the facts. Then would his\nparents too condemn him unjustly, would they\nbelieve the word of their son, a convicted thief,\nover the decision of an Army court? Would they\nbear his shame and disgrace with him, or oust him\nfrom their company? With these thoughts beating\naround his head, he knocked three times on the\ndoor.\nTo his amazement he was not met by his\nbespectacled father, but by another elderly\ngentleman, a stranger! Not without some\nembarrassment, the old man informed K \u2014 that\nhis parents were deceased. Somehow K \u2014 had\nalready guessed as much. His father had died of a sudden stroke three weeks previously, and as so\noften happens when one partner of a long\nmarriage is laid to rest, his mother had died of\ngrief just two days later.\nOf course K \u2014 hadn't heard the news earlier\nbecause he had not been allowed to receive any\nmail during his detainment. He was more\ndisappointed at not being able to at end their last\nrights and their funeral than at their actual deaths;\nafter all, they were both old, and it was right that\nthey should receive the last call at the same time.\nThe old gentleman nervously explained how\nthey'd been desperate to escape from the city,\nand had moved into the dwelling within a week of\nit being put up for sale. By now K \u2014 was in a state\nof mild shock. He did not even think to ask who\nhad given the permission for his abode to be put\nup for sale.\nThe old man took pity on him, and humbly\nasked K \u2014 to spend at least one night in his home.\nThe self-consciousness of K \u2014's disgrace\nsuddenly paled into a thin shadow beside the\ntragic loss of his be get tors. But no sooner had he\nbeen given the chance to overcome his\nbereavement than his sense of humiliation\nreturned once more.\nFor as soon as he stepped into his old living-room he was met by L \u2014, his army friend. There\nhe was warming his hands by the warm glow, of\nthe fire in the very place his father had sat and\nsmoked his pipe for so many years. The room, the\nfurniture and the ornaments had all changed; only\nthe distinctive smell of the place had remained.\nThere are some moments in a man's life that\nare like watersheds: in them he seems to see all\nhis striving s, his hopes and his misgivings in an\nentirely new and brilliant perspective. It is at this\ntime that his life is stripped of illusions; truth is no\nlonger fragmentary but, on the contrary, it\nappears to him as an integrated whole. It is like a man in a labyrinth, who, after years on aimless,\nendless wanderings down dead-ends, suddenly\nrealises and knows the way to the centre.\nAt the moment when L \u2014 stood up to greet\nhim, K \u2014 had such a revelation. Was it the shy,\nreluctant way his friend had offered him his hand,\nor the confused look in his eye that acted as the\ncatalyst? K \u2014 did not think about it. He knew it\nwas L \u2014 who had committed the theft and\nhidden ed the money in his belongings as sure as a man knows that the sun will rise on the morrow.\nIn the moment of recognition L \u2014 too realised\nthat he had unwittingly revealed his guilt. A sharp\npang of disappointment stung K \u2014's heart. He\nremembered the promise he'd made to himself in\nthe tavern. He looked across at the nativity scene\nin the corner of the room, and at the dining table\nlaid for the Christmas meal.\nfn that instant of emotional turmoil, he made\nan unconscious decision. This was a watershed in\nhis life, if he but knew it; his choice led either to\nwrath and ven gence or to forgiveness and mercy.\nIt was then that the sorrowful glint in his eye\nturned to one of the most sublime happiness. All\nthat had happened, he realised, was good, it could\nbe no other way. It is the vicious sentiments of\njealousy, avarice and anger that have to be\novercome; man has paid for his victories over\nthem with much blood, and will continue to do so.\nLet earthquake break the ground beneath your\nfeet, let nations be toppled, let your love be\nunrequited; what matter!

Construct a5 x5 square of letters beginning with the code word,\nwhich must have no recurring letters, continue\nwith the rest of the letters in the alphabet except\nJ.I does for I and J. Ex \u2014 Codeword \u2014 outspreading ly. Code Square:\noaTS? RA1NG LY3C FH Kha Vw X Z To encode a word, which must have an even\nnumber of letters, split'it into pairs of letters. If a pair of letters both appear in the same column\ntake the letters appearing directly below them IN\nORDER. If a pair are in the same row, take the\nletters to the right (OR, if at the end of a row or\ncolumn the letter at the beginning or top). If not,\ntake the respective opposite corners of the\nrect angel, obtained by the pair.\nEg 1 DELAWARE DE/LA/WA/RE\nDE-\u00bb IA\nL A*HL WA-\u00bbTL\nRE-\u00bbEA\nEg 2 SWINGS - SW/IN/GS\nSW-\u00bbTX NOT XT which would be WS\nIN-\u00bbRB\nGS-\u00bbYU\nPuzzle: Having solved all the clues and completed\nthe diagram, notice that the leading and reverse\ndiagonals are all white squares, the first six\nletters and the last three letters of the leading\ndiagonal and the first letter and last four letters of\nthe reverse diagonal are to be compared with the\nletters of the phrase \"Sean wishes you a drunken\nChristmas\", where they appear when the phrase\nis spelt out along the diagonals in order, not e he middle H appears one (twice!). Compare the\nrequired letters in pairs (ie the last letter of 35\nacross and the first letter of 8 down make a pair).\nThis SHOULD yield seven pairs of code\nequations from which the code square used in the\nfirst place is to be deduced!
