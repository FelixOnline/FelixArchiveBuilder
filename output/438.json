Although good performances were recorded, it was only in the diving pool that IC hit the medal traiL\nWater-polo\nOn Monday night the IC\nwater-polo second team entertained the Amphibians in the\nWinter Handicap KO. The match started with the IC team\nfive goals better off on handicap, but finished at -14 goals\nto 10 in the Amphibians' favour.\nSwimming Heats\nMeanwhile, on the swimming\nfront, a small IC contingent\nwas battling its way through\nheats of the UL U Swimming\nand Diving Championship, This year sawI C field an extra-strong Ladies' team, being represented in the 110yd s freestyle by Cecilia Nevil land Wendy Lowe, In' the Men's section John Bag n all, Francois Hindlet and Rory Lewis all made it to individual finals, with Ian Shott and Colin Dale just missing out in the backstroke respectively.\nDiving medals for IC lads\nIwo days later i he team\nreturned to Malet Street for the\nfinal. First on the programme\nwas the diving, which turned\nout to be IC's best event,\nYair Tamir won the gold medal,\nhaving turned up half an hour\nearly to perfect his dives, with Francois just being\npipped for second place by\nhalf a point.\nDisappointing swimming Finals\n^Unfortunately the IC swimmers were unable to\nrepeat this performance. In the\n440yd s freestyle Rory set the initial pace but was eventually overtaken and\nforced into third place, while\nJohn comfortably finished sixth with a point for IC, The individual medley produced a similar result, this ' time\nFrancois gaining third place and John coming in fifth.\nIn the blue ribbon event,\nthe 100yd s freestyle, Rory lost his chance to win the\ntitle three years running on\nthe final turn and had to be\ncontent with fourth place\nThe evening was completed\nwith the team relays. The medley team, consisting of\nIan Shott, Francois, Rory and\nJohn, finished well down the\nfield against some strong\nopposition. However certain\nmembers were saving their\nenergy for one final effort in the free sy tle relay and the IC team of Rory, Francois, John\nand Dave Lowther obtained a creditable second place. Excess merriment and a tiring 12 hour marathon bowl\naccounted for some rather\nmediocre ten pin bowling\nresults last weekend. At one\nstage the IC2 nds beat the ICl st \u2014 such was the state of\nthe teams. ;\nOn Saturday the club had bravely made their way to Birmingham for the annual\nBrum Marathon \u2014 12 hours\nnon-stop bowling and drinking.\nThe last few members of the\nteam really caught the spirit\nof the occasion by entering\nwith a barrel of beer. This provoked a large cheer from\nthe crowd.\nThe man of the match must\nbe Nick Gascoigne,-who, under\nthe \"\"affluence of in co hol' staggered and collapsed to\nthe line more often than\nanyone else. It was here that the seconds\nbeat the first s. Although\nSimon Spurrier hit the gate\nand suffer the penalty of50 pins, the marathon was worthwhile in that Pete Churchyard\nscored.201, so achieving national recognition at long\nJewish Society\nGrand ' Eng of Term Get Together Party', Food, fun, people and music.

    "content": "2 - FELIX, DECEMBER10 th1976 letters to the editor\nDeranged films at SCAB evening\nSir, \u2014 We have read with avid interest (?) the stirring piece, printed in last week's Felix issue, written by . ' S PUP' of\nPhysics Firstly, the reputation of\nSCAB Evenings as a forum for\n' Artistic' expression is well i now tj, even amongst physicists. Although the offending\nperformances affected Mr Spup\nnobody was forcing him to\nstay and continue watching the\nfilms. Secondly, intelligent\npeople should be able to\ndecide whether they wish to\nrook at something or not.\nThirdly, blue films were not\nthe only form of art to be\nperformed during the evening.\nWe would like to point out\nthat although we do not\nappreciate the finer art in performances of this nature,\nwe see no reason to persecute\nothers who attend, either for\nsexual satisfaction or just a good laugh. This can be\nillustrated by the fact that a sizeable proportion of the\naudience at the RCS Smoking\nConcert persisted in making\nremarks to the stripper about\nthe whereabouts of her alsatian\nand eels. If this fine fellow took the trouble to find out the views of other people, he\nwould see that the majority\nof people enjoyed both\nevenings' entertainment.\nWe look forward, with great\nanticipation, to the meeting\nbetween Mr Spup and Ms\nMillington, that well known\nentrep rene use of erotica.\nCi vEng111 c/o Scotland Yard Porn Squad\nMIKE ELK IN( Physics2) DAVE WRIGHT( Physics2)3 rd December 1976.\nCOPY DEADLINE\nFOR NEXT ISSUEMONDAY 2pm Sir, \u2014 Following the letter from\nS PUP, Physics2, printed in last week's issue, I would like\nto make some comments myself\nabout^ the SCAB evening\nevents which lite (I assume,\nperhaps mistakenly, that S PUP is a male) found so upsetting,\nthe way I see die situation,\nand lastly about an Editorial Policy I should like to see invoked in all future issues of\nFELIX. Firstly, though, I must say that the ranting s of this\nunfortunate (on his own\nadmission) individual are\nreminiscent of those of the\nestimable Lord Longford and Mary Whitehouse, who, at\ngreat risk, subject themselves\nto deplorable and unspeakable\ndepths of filth and depravity\nin order to protect the 'public\nat large'. What right have these\nself-appointed savers of our\nsouls to say which book,\ntelevision programme, film or\nshow we should or should not\nsee? What right has S PUP to\nsay that it is necessary to\n\" rid College of any future\nthreat of obscene showings\"? But what of these films, the\n\" obscene showings\"? Yes, they were degenerate \u2014 by\ndefinition, a blue movie can be nothing else! \u2014 and I, like\nS PUP, viewed the scenes of\nbestiality with contempt. But, in my case, as was evidently\nlacking in S PUP's, there was\nmingled with this initial\nrevulsion a touch of humour;\nif provided only by the\npathetic attempts of the\n'actors' to prompt the hound,\nwhich seemed perpetually to\nforget its lines, and the altogether crummy editing.\nS PUP knew what he was going to see \u2014 blue movies.\nIf (and we can only assume\nthat he did know his own\nopinions on such forms of\n'entertainment' before going\ninto the showing) he felt that\nhe was going to be so upset\nby the whole affair he should\nhave stayed away. That way\nhe would have saved himself\nmuch embarrassment and anger and possible mental\nderangement.\nBut who is this S PUP character anyway? Nobody\nknows. There are lots ol\npeople to choose from in Physics2, and of course, that\nmight be put in to throw you off the track. But the final\npoint 1 wish to make is this: it is a fine and noble thing to\nwrite to FELIX saying how\ngood this, how bad that, how\nobscene the other. But it is quite another kettle of fish to\nactually sign your name to\nyour views and be recognisable\nas the possessor of a belief,\nopinion, or mi she goss. It is only right, after alt, that a person without the guts to\nput his name behind his argument should not have his argument heard.\nYours DUNCAN SUSS\nEle c Eng2. What transport\nthorn ?\nDear Sir, \u2014 In response to\nDerrick Everett' s 'Orange\nMole' column last week we\nmust point out that transport\nis not 'a thorn in the Union's side',rather it is a great asset. ACC and RC C transport is\nself financing and is run\nefficiently by ACC and the\nRC C transport sub committee.\nThere certainly are a lot\nof problems in this area but at\npresent RC C and ACC have\nthem well under control.\nYours Sincerely,\nAndy Nelson Merlin Hibbs\nMike Eliot t Nicki Whitehead\nRichard Szczepanski\n(ie the RC C Executive)\n6th December 1976\nThe problems\nof parking\nDear Sir, \u2014 The other morning,\nwith my H Zone parking permit\nproudly stuck on my windscreen,\nI attempted to park in the\nallotted zone in Imperial\nInstitute Road. But lo! It seemed that\nH \u2014Zone was already full of\nother b lighters, who far from\nparking neatly side by side,\nhad parked in any-old- how\nwith exaggerated spacing. Eventually, after much ' to' ing and 'fro'ing, I managed to\nsqueeze in between two\nvehicles. At this point, a problem\nbecame apparent, since I was now unable to open the car door. I swiftly wound down the\nwindow and individually transferred my briefcase, flask and sandwiches through the window\nto the front bonnet. I then\ndexterously climbed out\nthrough the window and stood\nbetween the two cars, opened\nmy door \u2014 as far as I could \u2014\nand stretched inwards to wind\nup the window.\nAt this point \u2014 when the\nwindow was nearly closed \u2014\nanother problem became\napparent. I was unable to\nreach in far enough to close the window fully.\nWith some considerable\ndifficulty, I managed to get\nthe window fully open again.\nI then climbed back in to the\ncar, wound up the window and\nlocked die door from the inside. I then opened the front\nwindow on the opposite side, climbed out and opened the\ndoor. To my relief\nthe clearance between my car and the adjacent vehicle was\nabout an inch greater on this\nside, and I eventually succeeded in winding the window fully\nclosed. As I proudly shut the door\nand locked it, my triumph was\ncrowned \u2014 by a standing\novation from a window on the\n6th floor of the Biochemistry\nDepartment.\nAN ON.

Soon a whisker y fate, bleary-eyed and pinched\nwith the idd appears.\nThis is a scene which\noccurs every night on which soup-run takes place; when\nmembers of IC Community\nAction Group ( ICCA G) travel\ndown to the Charing Cross area at about midnight to\nwalk around the Embankment\nGardens and Strand Palace, to\ngive the \" dos s ers\" \u2014 who sleep-out there \u2014 something\nwarm to drink, and to have\na chat to them.\nThe soup-run is just one\nof the ICCA G's activities, the\ngroup's aim being to give\ndirect help to people in need,\nwhether it be children or old people.\nAt present we have a dire\nlack of people. We especially need help on:\nSoup-Run\nICCA G members are picked up from Falmouth Kitchen on\nMonday nights at 11 o' clock, and on Friday nights from\nTi zard kitchen at 11.30pm.

ICCA G members\nare picked up from the Union arch-way at 2 o' clock on Sundays, so if you like\nchildren, come along at this\ntime.\nCottage \u201e.-.ek ends are also organised for children. Here\nICCA G members go with them\nto a country cottage to have a weekend away from London. It can prove to be the first\ntime that some of the children\nsee such mundane things as cows. Visiting Old People: This can be quite success ful if you get on well with\npeople, and the old person\ntends to become like a second\ngrand-parent in the end. If you\nwould like to visit an old person once in a while, we\ncan put you in touch with\nsomebody.\nBlood-Do ning:-ICCA G is also responsible\nfor the blood-do ning sessions held in College, and is badly\nin need of somebody to take\nover the organisation of this.\nIf you are interested contact\nDave Millard or myself (Cheryl\nWhiffin). This activity helps\nsave people's lives and is well-worth supporting if you can. Whilst we're on the\nsubject, a few weeks ago IC donated 394 pints of blood \u2014\nmany thanks to those who\nhelped.\nICCA G also needs a publicity officer to do posters\nfor the various events; and above all we need drivers.

Thumbs up for\nJanuary travel\nThe setting up of a London\nStudent Travel Bureau ( L ST B), as put forward by ex\u2014IC\npresident Trevor Phillips three\nweeks ago to replace the\nliquidated NUS Travel, took a step towards inception this\nweek.\nRepresentatives from the\nstudent unions who would run\nthe Bureau's offices \u2014 at IC, University of London Union &\nQueen Mary College \u2014 met two\nmain travel companies SATA( who operate air flights) and Transalpino (who operate\ntrain travel).\nThe meeting, on Wednesday,\nagreed details to supply the\nBureau with SATA and Trans al pino services. Negotiations\nwith British Rail to sell their\nRail card have already been\nsuccessfully concluded. ICU president Nick Bray shaw, who attended the meeting, said that\nthe way is now open for a viable L STD. A few minor\noperators have yet to be seen\nand the final go-ahead could be given late next week. If\nthis happens the IC travel\noffice could re-open in January.\nUnion riot\nEight people were taken to\nhospital at the weekend\nfollowing a five minute battle\nbetween rival Turkish students\nat IC Union. The trouble began during\nthe all day annual conference\nof the left wing Turkish Federation of Students in the\nUnion Lower Refectory last\nSunday. A right wing group\nof students stormed the Union building just after noon, and tried to get into the Refectory.\nTheir way was barred by\nthe students in there who resisted the onslaught with\nsticks, chairs and later\nbottles. Damage to the Union\nincluded the loss of several\npanes of glass to the doors\nof the Union foyer, and the\nloss of a brass door handle to\nthe same.\nThe Federation have\noffered to pay for the damage,\nand have already forfeited\ntheir \u00a350 deposit on the room\nbooking.\nAlthough doubts exist to\nthe identity of the attackers,\n'The group inside the building\nlooked as though they expected\ntrouble' said one eyewitness\nin Be it Hall. The battle lasted five\nminutes after which the\nattackers withdrew. Police \u2014\nalerted by College security \u2014\narrived on the scene soon\nafterwards.\nThe police requested that\nthe meeting close promptly.\nThis it did at 2pm, eight\nhours ahead of schedule.

    "content": "6 - FELIX, December 10th1976 THE KNIGHTSBRIDGE ASSOCIATION'S ALTERNATIVE PLAN xxxx^^ College is living in\nRip Van Winkle land\nThe Knightsbridge Association is a typical local amenity\nsociety brought to life by \"960's legislation as a consultative\nbody to the planning authority, Westminster City Council, for\ndev elopement within its area.\nAbout a generation ago Imperial College acquired Princes Gardens and with it permission to construct term-time hostels\nand vacation-time hotels. Thus the College received permission\nto demolish the houses in Princes Gardens in the days before\npublic consultation. One can now hypothesize that a better\nsolution might have been to house students in the central\nCollege area, thereby enlivening the campus deserted after the\nday's work.\nIn the last two years the College has made application to\nincrease the existing student population in Princes Gardens from\n600 to 1500, though the subsequent listing (by the Dept of\nEnvironment of Nos 8 to 15 reduced the increase to 600 persons.\nDuring these proceedings the Association has sought to cooperate with the College to produce a solution acceptable to its\nneighbours: and repeatedly the College has declined. It has to be said that after a decade of experience, neighbours\nto the Halls are confident that what amounts to a virtual replica\nextension of Linstead Hall would result in a sharp deterioration\nof desirable standards of a normal domestic environment. Indeed\nwe believe that any new building should have a domestic rather\nthan hotel emphasis. To many it seems that the College, in\npursuing its 20 year old plan, is more like Rip Van Winkle than\na University in the forefront of scientific development and\nequipped with an industrial sociology department.\nThis summer, the Knightsbridge Association, challenged to\nmake constructive proposals, very reluctantly set about producing\nits own scheme. At root we believe it necessary to retain the\nresidential area in the South Kensington mix, to avoid not only a Bloomsbury death, but the sort of dangers of central city d is integration that have been emphasized by the Planning Minister\nand his predecessor: there are many ominous examples to be\navoided if the enormous exodus from London of those in search\nof better living conditions is to be stemmed.\nOvercrowding is one of the repulsive features of city life:\ncertainly the College has already overtopped the historic density\nof its own (and the adjoining) Square. Proposals to increase it\nwould account for one quarter of the whole of Knightsbridge\nsimply invite resistance. Our scheme then is designed to mend\nthe gaps in Princes Gardens with useful buildings to house an\noptimum and not just a maximum additional population,\nOn the east side our proposal includes a car park in the\nexisting basement, decked over with 3 tennis courts (with an all weather finish), and a series of covered games courts with\nmaison et tes above accommodating a student population of 72.\nOther facilities, including a medical centre and acre che, are\nA sketch of the proposals put forward by the Knightsbridge Association (looking from the present Garden Hall on the north side of\nPrinces Gardens.\nlocated in several storeys above the existing boiler house. To\nthe east of Linstead Hall open car parking would be obscured by\na per go la. In our view, a building four storeys in height is sufficient to\nblanket from sight the back of Ennismore Gardens terrace.\nContinuing to use the materials of the original builders \u2014 brick\nand stucco \u2014 the style would balance the mews design and the\narticulations of its main street Victorian neighbours.\nOn the north side, some sixty students would be accommodated\nin a low rise building fronted by a double storey conservatory\ncommon room. Apart from the attractiveness of such a feature\nthe proposal is aimed at satisfying the Planning Authority's desire to see design sympathetic to its Victorian surrounds.\nSuch a height would continue the line of the heavily emphasised\nporticos: the exposed terrace end would mimic features from its\nmain facade.\nConceptual design of student halls of residence has made\nradical progress in the last 20 years: our own design, put\nforward soley in outline, incorporates this progress and we are\nconfident it would meet with the approval of those whom it is\nintended to accommodate.\nTHE COLLEGE SECRETARY REPLIES^x W ft WS?*: 'It's a question of\nThe College Secretary, Mr Davies has been one of the major\nspokesmen for College on the Linstead proposals. As such FELIX felt that it would be only courtesy to let him reply to some of the\npoints raised elsewhere in this feature.\nConcerning extent of College policy in influencing the terms\nA longitudinal section through three courtyards of the plans drawn up by Wiggins and Gardiner. It shows the mezzanine\narrangement of study bedrooms around a central staircase. The existing Linstead boiler house is shown on the left -common rooms or study bedrooms are planned here.\nFELIX, DECEMBER10 th19767 THE WARDENS' VIEWS\nMore open discussion\nneeded\nA model of College proposals for an extension to Linstead Hall.\n10 years ago when plans for the present Linstead Hall were\nbeing drawn up, its warden designate, Civil Engineer Dr Paul Minton, was deeply involved in consultations with the College architects. Along with then Domestic Bursar, Carl Seaford,and\nSenior Warden Mr Stephenson \u2014 his equivalent now would be the\nCollege Senior Tutor \u2014 Dr Minton spent a considerable time\nformulating L instead' s design. He was involved in the planning\nfrom the early stages, something which has not happened with\nthe present warden, Dr C arab in e, over the extension plans.\nIn fact whilst Dr Carabine has been involved with the Working\nParty on the Linstead Extension he has only been so since just\nyou draw the lines'\nof the benefaction, Mr Davies said there was 'no consultation\nabout the precise terms of the benefaction'.\nAs to whether the money donated could be used for a new hall\nrather than an extension he pointed out that as the same benefactor had given the money for the original Linstead Hall, 'not\nun-naturally he or she envisaged an extension to Linstead and\nCollege did not quarrel with that.'\nQuestioned if College had asked the ben if ici ary to change any\nconditions he commented that 'College had informed benefactor\nabout the rejection of planning permission.'\nMr Davies refuted the suggestion that the views of the Knightsbridge Association( KA) had not been taken into account.\n'College has had meetings with KA and some of the points they\nraised have been met.'\nFurthermore, he emphasised that although College had to\nhave 'things done fast', this in no way implied that there was\ninadequate consultation or that the urgency was a cause of the\nultimate rejection of the plans.\nHe was sure that the composition of the Working Party was adequate. He added 'there has to be a limit as to the numbers\ninvolved in the planning process. It's a question of where you\ndraw the lines in this matter.'\nHe further pointed out that Dr Ken Weale \u2014 College Tutor and\nan ex-warden-had been involved with the working party from the\nbeginning. The inclusion of Dr Carabine was not implied because\nhe was the present warden. Wardenship has a tenure of five years\nand Dr Carabine need not necessarily be the warden when the\nextension is opened.\nMr Davies was not prepared to comment on the findings of the\nRoyal Fine Art Committee, or on possible College policy as seen in the new brief for the architects. He felt that it would be\ninappropriate as the Governor's will discuss the question of the\nLinstead Hall extension at their meeting a week today.\nA typical courtyard - showing the mezzanine section and roof ft fc fc gardens - as envisaged by the Wiggns and Gardiner Scheme.\nafter the time the plans had been submitted to College by the\narchitects Norman and Dawbarn. His role was as observer in\nattendance, assessing the plans and presenting any points\nraised by the Linstead Hall Committee.\nMe feels the Working Party have been lumbered with a plan\nwhich is, in essence, a repeat of the Northside plan for a hall\nabove the sports centre (the plan was subsequently dropped\nbecause the foundations of the centre were not suitable).\nHe has never really been happy with the proposals for an\nextension, favouring the idea of a separate hall. Initially, he\nraised this with the Working Party where the idea received some\nsympathy. But the terms of the benefaction appeared to be\nexplicit, requiring an extension to Linstead Hall. The Linstead Hail Committee did not react favourably to the\nWorking Party's proposal e 'ther; they did so on the grounds that\nthere would be a large number of students in the present common\nrooms, and that these would be the only access to the new\nbuilding. Dr Carabine conveyed this to the Working Party, along\nw: th mod if c;ations made by Paul Jowitt, then sub-warden of\nLinstead and himself a Civil Engineer. These modifications\nincluded the provision of an entrance at ground level. These modifications were accepted by the Working Party.\nDr Carabine emphasises that his criticism is not really of the\narchitects plans \u2014 as long as the building is functional and\nattractive - but of the brief presented to Norman and Dawbarn\nand the manner in which it was drawn up. He recognises that the\nCollege had a tight schedule, being required to start building by\nJanuary 1977. However, he feels that 'fo some extent, consultation within College was curtailed at very early stages when\nperhaps it would have been of most value.'\nThe Working Party did not discuss the Knightbridge As soci ation or Professor Wiggins' alternative plans, Dr Carabine said. For various reasons they have not met since July. He expressed relief on hearing of the extension of the time\nlimit, and sees it as providing an opportunity for further discussion. This could centre around both the type of residential\nunit required and the wishes of outside groups, especially the\nKnightsbridge Association and Westminster City Council. He\nthinks there is a need for involving students wardens and\nadministration in any future working party to produce a concept\nof residence suitable for everyone.\nOn the suggestion of an open meeting on the subject, Dr\nCarabine commented that it might be a good idea if there were\nenough people interested. 'After all', he said, 'If a competent\nfirm of architects have not managed to produce an acceptable\nbuilding within their brief, then it indicates that one ought to go\nback and discuss the constraints', (of the brief).\nHe felt it was pointless to speculate on alternatives at this\nstage - in fact he did not know the College plan had been rejected until it was published in FELIX but thought the consultation with the Fine Arts Commission was good since 'an\naesthetic consideration is needed at this stage.'\nDr Carabine's call for more discussion was echoed by Mr\nFrank Potter, Warden of Keogh Hall, Southside and a former warden\nof L instead. He does 'not know how one can go ahead without\nmore discussion.' He sees the extra year as giving a chance for\na 'new beginning' with all parties, including students and\nwardens, involved in consultation.\nHis personal opinion of the design of the extension was that\nit was incongruous with the present Linstead Hall. He also felt\nthat management problems would arise and there was the possibility that a requirement of 'double sittings' at meals would\nresult in some students not feeling part of L instead. Mr Potter is 'not keen' on the idea of an open meeting. He\nfavours quiet discussion, discussion which he feels is now\nabsolutely necessary.\nDavid Crabbe\n\n"

The new benefaction came in January\nthis year and was conditional on College being in a position to\nstart building by January 1977. The College duly set up a working party that considered the plans submitted by architects\nNorman and Dawbarn.\nThe plans were also scrutinised by Westminster City Council's( WCC) Department of Architecture and Planning when they\nreceived the am mended College plans. Since July the College and the Department have been in consultation, ironing out design problems and servicing arrangements.\nThese negotiations were so successful that the Department\ngave the College plans a clean bill of health in a report to the\nW CC Town Planning Committee meeting of 28th October. In\nparticular the Department rejected the ideology of a low rise development for Princes Gardens. They thought that a third type\nof architecture \u2014 in addition to the terraced houses and student\nhalls \u2014 would not be appropriate to complete the square. They\nfelt the college plans retained the Gardens' essential character-is tics. The Department also decided that a population density of 200\npersons per acre was 'not un appropriate for student ac com moda tion'. Thus they rejected the Knightsbridge Association' s(KA) submission that a density of 85\u2014100 be adopted for the new The space that refuses to be filled at present.\nspend \u00a3350,00000\nbuilding. Attached to their report was a draft letter to IC giving\nplanning permission.\nThe Department's recommendations were overturned at the\nTown Planning Committee meeting and the design rejected on\ngrounds of height and general design. The meeting was well attended by the KA, who had lobbied the Councillors beforehand.\nThe mood of the meeting was such that a member of College remarked that it was a case of \" How do we reject these plans\", not 'Whether we reject them\". Since then the benefactor has extended the deadline to\nJanuary 1978. The extension will be fully discussed at a Governing Body meeting today week.\nThe College proposal\nThe proposed extension to L instead Hall has been planned\nby the College Architects to a layout and design which embodies\nthe advice and requirements of student representatives who were\nmembers of a Working Party first established in 1972 to consider\nthe further development of student residential accommodation in\nPrince's Gardens. Although earlier schemes for loan-financed\ndevelopment had to be abandoned through lack of finance,the\noffer by the Anonymous Benefactor made possible the realisation\nof plans which have been the subject of careful consideration\nfor some years. The extension is planned to provide 9 5 residential places on\nthe site immediately north of L instead Hall and above the existing ca lori fier chamber which was specially designed as a base for a new building. So as not to intrude a third architectural\ndesign into the Gardens (in view of the preservation order on\n8\u201415 Prince's Gardens on the north side) the architectural\ndesign reflects broadly the rhythm and style of L instead Hall, it follows the same structural grid and has identical floor heights\nfor ease of communication. In order to take account of views expressed by local residents the overall height of the building is\nthree storeys lower than L instead Hall itself; for aesthetic\nconsiderations and for economy of maintenance improved materials\nare to be used on the exterior of the building, and the design of\nstudy bedroom? has been improved to reduce sound emission \u2014 a point of concern to the local residents.\nInternally a typical floor is designed on a \"communal\ncorridor\" principle around which study bedrooms are double-banked, the corridor being divided by fire doors to permit 4 or 5\nstudents to share a utility room (galley) bathroom and separate\nWC and shower compartment \u2014 a simple flat concept \u2014 but also allowing, if necessary, for a wider social grouping of up to 16\u2014\n20 on one floor. Vertical circulation is by staircase and lifts.\nThe building includes two self-contained flat lets for the\naccommodation of married students. The concentration of the\nrooms in a single block does not contravene the permitted\ndensities laid down by the planning authorities, and contributes\nto developing the Gardens to their full potential. The College Architects have been in close touch throughout the planning\nstages with the officers of the Planning authority, whose publicly\nexpressed advice was that the Architects should not do other than\nconform to the lines of the square, in order to retain the essential characteristic enclosure which is typical of London squares. Having looked deeply at the various plans put forward for the\nLinstead extension the two of us feel inclined to agree in\nprinciple, with the height of the College design. Like W. City Council's own Architectural and Planning Dept we are against a low rise extension. The square should be completed with a medium rise development \u2014 like Southside and Linstead \u2014 as originally envisaged before the ' listing' of 8\u201415 Princes Gardens.\nWe feel that, any low rise development would destroy the\nsquare by adding a further architectural design. We hope that the\nRoyal Fine Art Commission ( RFA C), who have been asked to\ncomment on how \u2014 low rise or medium rise \u2014 the square should\nbe completed, will come to a similar conclusion. If they do this\nmay provide sufficient grounds for a College appeal to the Department of Environment.\nHowever, we are less keen on the way College has approached\nthe extension's design. There seems to have been insufficient\ndiscussion within College. We were hardly endeared to learn\nthat L instead warden Dr Carabine did not receive a copy of the\nCollege plans \u2014 as submitted to Westminster CC \u2014 and had to\nget one through devious means.\nFurther, Topic, the College magazine, has not been allowed to publish as much as it would have liked on the College plans.\nWe realise that in the future interests of the College some matters\nshould not be made public immediately \u2014 however does this rule\nout a completely 'quiet discussion'? We feel that whatever the comment of the RFA Commission further discussion is needed \u2014 especially concerning the facade\nand interior details. This is an area where it would be useful\nto involve the warden, Dr C arab in e, even though he has not been\ndesignated warden of the new extension. We would ask the question that if one of the terms of the\nbenefaction has been changed (the time limit) is it absolutely impossible to change others if either College is cons i sent ly denied planning permission or changes are warranted to provide\na better hall? Further more we are not completely satisfied that the terms\nof the benefaction were not influenced by top college personnel.\nThis supplement is intended to stimulate discussion on the\nLinstead extension. Letters on the subject are welcome since they will help to provide a wealth of ideas to construct the new\nbrief to the College architects.\nThe uncredited articles in these four pages have been\nwritten by College, the Knightsbridge Association and Professor\nWiggins.

This term the takings are up by approx 15%\nwhich represents a5% increase in profit\nratios (approx). This rise is largely\ndue to the lack of bad publicity in the Union's media.

That was never\nsaid,suggested or agreed by the meeting.\nWhat was agreed was that the referendum\nwill be held in the spring term. It would\nappear that the most sensible time to\nhold this referendum is before the\nsabbatical elections so that they do not\ndegenerate into a question of \" in or\nout\".

I will have become a responsible, independent worker, relieving my boss of his work burden. I will type his letters,\narrange appointments for him, deal with\nunwanted visitors. I will be punctual,\nhonest, well-dressed and have a sense\nof humour.\nThat' s not being a status sy sm bol. It's hard work. Secretaries are a very vital part of business life. They are dedicating\ntheir life to make the boss' s easier \u2014 if\nhe doesn't take advantage of the help\noffered, more fool he. Indeed there is a certain amount of truth in the statement:\n'British executives need to be trained in\nthe proper use of a secretary'.\nOn Tuesday, November 14th we are going Carol singing with Gui Ids \u2014 de tai Is\nfrom IF Union.

These outline in some detail\nhow the executive will spend their\nmoney. As most of you will know NUS is in some financial difficulties due to loosing \u00a343,000 when travel went bust\n(because of an off-set agreement with the bank). This, together with the\nrecent spate of Scottish d is affiliations, means that NUS will have very little to\nspend on campaigns next year.\nICU says cut International work The ICU delegation will be proposing\nthat all the money NUS currently spends\non International work (Chi le, South Africa, Portugal etc) is transfered to the more\nimportant domestic campaigns such as Grants, fees, social security and\noverseas students.\nThe other motions to be discussed are on Grants, Overseas Students, Racial ism, South Africa and the NUS Constitution. On the Constitution motion\nIC has put an am mend ment calling for the\nintroduction of direct elections for the NUS executive. This unfortunately stands\nvery little chance of being accepted. ICU has also put am mend ment s in on\nSouth Africa and Grants \u2014 the Grants\nam mend ment calling for the abolition of\nthe parental contribution and discretionary\nawards as the main aims for next year's grants campaign.\nThe rest of the business of Conference\nis taken up with the executive report of\nwhat they have done in the past year.\nAll night bars.\nThis may sound a heavy workload and\nconference is in session from 9am till12 midnight to get most business d is cussed \u2014 the only compensation is that\nthe bars don't close until 6a ml Finally, following last week's incredible 1200 signatures on the letter to Mrs\nWilliams about fees, I'd like to thank the\npeople who did most of the hard work in\ncollecting those signatures \u2014 the\nDepartmental Representatives.\nThis house\nthat a successful debating society\nis essential to Imperial College's welfare\nand cultural well being.\nWell that's one motion, which would\nprobably be carried quite easily by IC's recently revived Debating Society.

    "content": "8 - FELIX, DECEMBER10 th1976 An alternative plan from Professor Wiggins & Stephen Gardiner\nHuman habitation\nfor students\nPeople have begun to hate universities. If you doubt this, look at the newspapers \u2014 empty of understanding of what\nuniversities do, and full of malice towards'students, invariably\nimagined in a state of parasitic al dependence on the' long\nsuffering taxpayer. The cut-back in university expenditure which\nstarted well before the squeeze, is just one reflection of the\nstate of public opinion.\nThere are many reasons for this view of us. One reason is the\nself-absorption of universities. The most perfect expression of\nthe self-centred ness of London University is its building policy. The Sunday Times for 10th August 1969 wrote:\n\" London University, whose reputation for phi list in is m was already secure, has struck its shrewdest blow yet against the\nforces of beauty and pleasure .... Woburn Square is gone .... it is\ngone by the will of what is supposed to be a great seat of\nlearning and culture financed by public money and spurred on by\ngood intention. It is worse than a crime. It is a folly. All those\nresponsible .... should be ashamed.\" But conservationists are not the only people who distrust the\nUniversity. People who care about modern architecture are\nequally concerned. Apart from the Royal College of Art, what\ngood building has the University put up in Kensington? The Secretary of the Royal Fine Arts Commission once wrote to Norman and Dawbarn, architects then as now to Imperial College,\" The quality of the design (of the IC campus) seems to\nexpress a great commercial concern rather than a seat of learning\nand research.\" Will the new Huxley building in Queens Gate refute this\ncharge?\nThere are conservationists and there are connoisseurs of\narchitecture, and there are neighbours overshadowed and ignored.\nBut there is yet another group who find IC's present buildings\nwanting \u2014 the students themselves, who complain about the isolation which has resulted from the plan you find at L instead Hall, four rooms to a cell with virtually no other reference point\nbetween the cell and the whole building. The remedy for this is\nnot another plunge into the unknown \u2014 a hotel version of the\nsame unsuccessful building form. What is needed is a way of\nbuilding which has proved its ability to answer to the needs of\na community.\nThat at least was the possibility I envisaged, and which the\nshame I have long felt for the University, prompted me to\ncommission Stephen Gardiner to explore, when the College unveiled its plan to enclose Princes Gardens again, and to\noverwhelm with yet more high buildings the space and air which\nthe square had accidentally got from the clearance of its East side. The guidelines I gave Stephen Gardiner were, first, the\nneed to design an alternative which students would be happy in;\nsecond, the position of the site in the existing square; third, the\nspecial character of the neighbourhood as a whole. He drew the\ndrawings which can be found in the Union Office. He writes\nabout his scheme:\n\" The alternative to a high-rise concrete slab block extending\nLinstead Hall northwards (with inevitable internal central\ncorridor, lifts and uniform windows), is a scheme with low\nbu iI dings spreading across the whole site between Ennis more Gardens Mews and the hedge which marks the beginning of the\nsquare. This means a series of domestic scale buildings which can be arranged to make a series of courts between three and\nfour storeys high. The court, like the street terrace, is a building form which has been tried and enjoyed over centuries, whereas the high-rise building form has come to be rejected\nwithin the space of one generation. The court makes a focus for\nliving and working. It brings people together round a community\nspace. People can see each other, or are aware of the presence\nof their neighbours. This makes for a friendly, secure society.\" The brief asked us to provide the maximum number of\nstudents that was architecturally acceptable for the site. We\nfind that we can house 280 (and 300 if we build over the boiler\nhouse rather than build a Common Room there). We do not like\nthe idea of double rooms for students but, simply for purposes\nof showing what an alternative to the official scheme would look\nlike, we have reluctantly followed the College's own over ali ratio of single to double rooms.\n\" Obviously we have to live with the economics of this\nproblem. For a rather smaller number of students, we could have\ndesigned a better scheme with even less of the feel of \" student buildings\". But even with the present number of rooms, ours\nwould be very unlike most of the student housing we have seen\nin London, especially when the small gardens established them-selves.( If you doubt the beauty or utility of small gardens like\nthese, walk around in the City, eg between Carter Lane and the\nRiver, and see what such spaces can be like, and how much\npeople value them.)\n\" Taking the three phases together, the capacity of our\nscheme is the same as the College's if, when the College seek\nplanning permission for Phase III in the 1980s, the City Council insists on enforcing daylighting regulations and removes three\nstoreys ( s80 students).\n\" The guidelines of the existing square and the adjoining mews streets of the neighbourhood confirm the Tightness of\ncourts among buildings. The square contains a large garden and\nthe courts are like echoes of this garden. They continue it as\nsmaller gardens. At the same time, it has to be remembered that\nwhen this Victorian square was built over a hundred years ago it\nwas all of one stucco piece, and the trees were saplings. It was\nnever a spacious square, but one thing saved it. The South side was built lower than the East and West sides.( You can see one\nor two of the remaining houses at the South-west corner.) The square was tilted to the midday sun. That advantage is gone with\nthe great height of the rebuilding to the South. It follows that any\nproposal to close the East side, and to cut out light, must be\navoided. Such enclosure can only be avoided by low buildings, and by treating L instead Hall as a large free standing object \u2014\nwith an effect which would be thoroughly typical of Kensington.\n\"Without going into a maze of detail, there is another important factor which influenced our design, and this was the need to\nrelate the level of the site to the level of the square. At the same\ntime, the level of our roof lines had to match the level of the\nmews roof line. These two things were achieved in one move \u2014\nby raising the level of our site ( at present one storey below that\nof the square) by four feet. The section - and thus the staircase\nplan with two rooms off every landing \u2014 evolved from this move.\nWe use a mezzanine section where the lower ground floor starts\nfrom the present level of the site and our entrance starts from\nthe new level. It sounds complicated but is really very simple, as a glance at our drawings will show. The traditional college staircase plan with between 14 to 20 students off it creates a pleasant domestic arrangement which leads to roof gardens at\nthe top. These, like the courts below, unify the blocks, and\nrelate them to the square as a whole.\n\" The roof gardens provide a communal space for the inhabitants of each block. The courts are a place where all the students\nin the scheme and from elsewhere would come across one\nanother in a natural way as they do in countless other universities\n\u2014 Cambridge, Durham, Oxford, Bologna, Harvard, Cracow, Amsterdam, Prague, (to name but a few).\n\" There are people who disagree with the idea that the back\nof Ennismore Gardens could define the western side of Princes Square. They dislike these backs. But these very people would\ncondemn half the students in the official scheme to look close up on no other view than the one they say they dislike. Our\nalternative would involve planting trees and grass - in making\nsomething which would be good to look at and live in.\" I am sorry the Union Executive did not invite me to their\nmeeting to explain our drawings, which they have misunderstood\nin certain important ways, or respond to a further suggestion of\na meeting with students. A letter of clarification of the drawings\nwas sent to Mr Brayshaw on 16th October, which I hope he will show to any students who are interested in problems ot domestic\nor communal architecture.\" When Stephen Gardiner had made his drawings we had them\ncosted by the quantity surveyor who had acted for the L instead Hall building. Our building costs slightly less than the College's at Phase One and 19% less per student housed at Phases Two and Three. What is more, the low-rise alternative would admit of\npiecemeal additions after Phase One, and would enable the\nCollege to complete student accommodation gradually with the\nhelp of small benefactions. The plan is flexible. It is to be\nfavoured if what the College really wants is to accommodate as many students as soon as possible. There is something for a technologist to think about in these\neconomic findings. The ugly solution need not be the cheap one,\nand the cheap solution need not be the ugly one. The time is\ncoming when people will require technologists to find solutions\nwhich combine simplicity with beauty and economy and congruity\nto the needs of everyday life. The Princes Gardens scheme combines mediocrity and defiance of neighbourhood with very\nhigh cost - money which would be better spent providing more\nstudent accommodation here and now.\nI think people would stop talking about the need to enclose the square and undo the fortuitous benefits of the demolition of\nthe East side of Princes Gardens if they would try to think what\nthings would be like on the ground when the Phase Three block,\ndaylighting infringements and all, is finished, and when the\nprocess which began with a locking of the light from the South\nis completed. In a situation like this, it is the emptiest formalism\nto speak of the classic qualities of London squares in connex ion with Princes Gardens. Consider Bedford square: It is wider in\nextent and lower on all sides \u2014 as well as complete. In Princes Gardens, where so much has gone wrong already, what is needed\nis an architectural idea which will make the best of what remains:\na sense of space, and light from the East. As it is, if the\nCollege has its own way, the gardens will be overwhelmed \u2014 and\nby a building which I have yet to find any member of Imperial\nCollege call beautiful.\nLet me end where I began. In the Universities we have to\nlearn to live in harmony with the city, else we shall eventually\nbe starved out of the city. I leave to Leibniz, a philosopher whom\nI think I can rely on Imperial College to respect as co-inventor\nwith Newton of the infinite sti mal calculus, the last word on what\nsort of loss that will be for the community of learning.\n\" . . . . thus a new maxim \u2014 which goes completely against the\nold one has become necessary; namely that students and\nscholars should participate as much as possible and be as\nmuch as they can with people and in the world.\" "
