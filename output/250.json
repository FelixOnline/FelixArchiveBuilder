    "content": "2 FELIX\nH.G. Wells Society\nU.F.O.'s The meeting opened approximately on time, and about 15\nminutes later the committee, accompanied by the Guest speaker\nCharles Bowen arrived, after being delayed by a very important\ncup of coffee in Southside upper\nlounge.\nMr. Bowen began his lecture by\nsaying that many people refused\nto take the question of U.F.O's. seriously, even though there had\nbeen sightings for many years,\nand a large amount of publicity\nfor the last 20 years.\nMr. Bowen is the editor of the\nHying Saucer Review, and in this\ncapacity has made a number of\nappearances on television and\nradio. Curiously enough he says\nhe does not believe in flying\nsaucers as such, but insists there\nis a definite phenomenon to be\ninvestigated.\nIn his discussions Mr. Bowen\ntold how in 1953 an American\nAirforce Committee was set up\nand systematically investigated\nabout 20 selected cases of sight-in gs. This Committee, however,\nmerely reported that nothing existed which presented itself as a threat to the U.S.A. Before circulation of this then secret document the C.I.A. modified it to\nsay that any U.F. G. reports\nshould be played down as much\nas possible, a thing which Mr.\nBowen believes is still happening.\nHe then went on to describe how\nmany, in his view, legitimate\nsightings had been made out to\nbe sightings of planets or stars\ndistorted by atmospheric conditions. After describing, rather vividly,\na number of sightings reported to\nhim Mr. Bowen concluded by\nsaying how he dislikes people who\ndefinitely go out of their way to\nobserve U.F.O's. and rates any\ninformation put forward by them\nas useless, but readily accepts\nthe in format i or* forward f ordinary pe op l<10 sec one i these strange o',,.ct s once in a lifetime.\nGhosts\nThe Wells Soc. Ghosts Group\nexamined last year's trip to Hannath Hall on Tuesday 24 October.\nPhil Haskell, the chief spirit,\nstarted by giving an outline of the\nlegend concerning Hannath Hall,\none of the best-known haunted\nhouses in the country. Joseph\nHannath is supposed to have\nbricked up his dead wife in a chimney. Phil then described the\napparatus which they took with\nthem : tape-recorders, cameras,\npressure and heat detecting de-vices. A great deal of time spent\ntravelling, setting up the apparatus\nand two chilly nights waiting produced precisely nothing. Mr.\nHaskell's view was that the psychological attitude of the party\nwas too gay and cynical.\nPsychological ?\nProfessor A. J. Ellison of\nQMC, a member of the Society\nfor Psychic Research, agreed with\nhis view; in fact he stressed that\nthe psychological attitude of the\nghost watchers was of paramount\nimportance in creating ghosts. He\npraised the technical ingenuity of\nthe group before warning of the\ndangers of attributing noises having rational explanations to hypothetical ghosts.\nIC 2000\nThe latest in the series of Wells\nSoc. Study Group projects\u2014the\n\" I.C.2000\" Group\u2014had its introductory meeting on Tuesday\n17th October.\nThe Group's aim is to identify\nthe choices and decisions open to\nus which, if they are taken or just\nleft to drift, will determine what\nan institution like this College will\nbe like in 2000 A.D. For example, the new University of Sussex is a product tof\nmany radical ideas. To discuss\nthis topic, the Group invited\nProfessor David Daiches, one of\nthe thinkers behind the innovations, to speak on \" Universities\nof the Future.\"\nThe main new idea in the creation of the University of Sussex\nwas the \" core and context,\" ap-p roach; that is, to study a specialist subject plus its context among\nrelated subjects. This was\nachieved by creating schools\ncovering several subjects in place\nof separate departments.\nOther ideas have included\nseminars bringing together students of different subjects. There\nis a systematic attempt at early\nprevention of student breakdowns\nand suicides. Students are advised\non how to study and organise\ntheir time, in order to employ\ntheir labours most productively.\nProfessor Daiches also drew from\nhis long experience in North\nAmerica to compare their systems\nwith ours.\nThe Group's next meetings are:\n\" Science as non-education, or\nhow to be a young fossil\" on 14\nNovember, and a talk by Professor Lord Ritchie-Calder on 21\nNovember.\n:::::\n::::;\n::::!\n:::::\nA CAREER IN\nENGINEERING\nF01\nPHYSICISTS, MATHEMATICIANS,\nMATERIALS SCIENTISTS,\nCHEMISTS as well as ENGINEERS.\nWe need graduates and postgraduates for our training schemes leading to\ncareers in the operational side of the industry and ultimately to management,\nand for research work. If you want to lear rt further about us you will be interested\nin the following:\niii l! Visits to our Research Laboratories These are arranged to our laboratories at\nBerkeley, Leatherhead, Marphwood and to\nour Computing Branch during the week\n1 to 5 January 1968.\nVacation Training This is given in all aspects of the Beard's work.

Hotel accommodation will be\nprovided and travelling expenses paid.\nUniversity Visits Representatives of this Industry will visit\nthis university on\nand will be pleased to meet you to discuss\nopportunities.\nCENTRAL\nELECTRICITY\nGENERATING BOARD Hop\nPunch-up\nFollowing an argument over\nthe ownership of some bottles of\nbeer at the end of last Saturday's hop, Rugby club member Rog\nMarshall was attacked with a bottle by two non-students.\nSubsequently there was a chase\ndown Prince Consort Road in\nwhich Rich Davies, Captain of\nSoccer, caught one of the offenders who was holding a large\niron bar. Returning to the security office the police were summoned and the miscreant removed (although he was later released as he could not be positively identified). IC Exec is to\nhold a full inquiry into the affair\nat their meeting on Monday.\nIC Protests\nI.C, participation in the anti-Vietnam war rallies was, as might\nbe expected, strictly limited. Following Dave Flint's appeal at the\nlast Union meeting for as many\nas possible to take part in the\nrallies, an estimated fifteen I.C. students went to Trafalgar Square\nfor the Sunday demonstration.\nAbout half this group stayed for\nthe holocaust later outside the\nAmerican Embassy. As far as\ncan be gathered no I.C. man got\ninvolved with the police-crowd\ninfighting, and the only incident\nof note perpetrated by I.C. was a severe reprimand to the Young\nLiberals of I.C. from the YL London organizer for carrying the\nwrong banners on the wrong day.\nExotic Jazz\non Sunday\nJazz and Folk returned with a bang last Sunday following the\nprevious week's rather placid ses-sion. The Splinter Group provided the Jazz complete with bow\ntics and satin sashes and produced\na stirring effect in the subdued\nblue light. Many strange sounds\nfrom such exotic instruments as\nthe \" swan nee whistle \" and the\n\" kazoo \" were combined with\nfirst class tr ad, and created continuous humour. The performance was indeed worthy of this\nI.C. band which is recognised as\nthe top college traditional jazz\ngroup.\nFriday Trad\nFriday October 20th saw the\nfirst traditional jazz concert of the\nyear. Alan Elsdon's group performed impeccably with near\nbrilliant solos by guest trombonist\nJohnny Pickard and clarinet\nplayer Andie Cooper. Mick\nGilligan on bass was most entertaining both to see and hear with\nhis unique way of making faces at\nthe double bass in time to the\nmusic!\nM0R PH Y STOMP In addition to the Sunday night\nspots, there is a Morphy Day\nStomp in Southside featuring Blue\nNile and his Delta Jazzmen. On\nFriday November 3rd the Ken\nGibson Big Band returns. This\nfifteen piece jazz orchestra really\nmust be heard. Last at I.C. in\nMarch, it made such a thrilling\nsound that a return booking was\nmade at once.\nKnobbly Knees contest at Sweatery Hour.\nSWEAT\nLast Thursday evening Tizard\nHall held a protest \u2014 another\nprotest! \u2014\u2022 against the hothouse-style central heating prevalent in\nSouthside. It took the form of\na Sweatery hour\u2014a corruption\nof the standard Tizard Buttery\nhour^and wine was served in\nplace of the usual coffee. The\nnotable feature was that all the\nprotesters protested by wearing\ntowels, and little else. Those\nwho did not wear towels had to\npay extra for their wine\u2014an anti-democratic measure put forward\nby new RCS President Bob\nMackman. There was a knobbly\nknees contest, deservedly won by\ncraggy Geoff Longstaff, but this\ndid not detract from the main\npurpose of the den ud ation, which\nfor some can only have been to\nThe sub warden was heard to\ncomplain bitterly about the pro-test. He claims that if the protestors get their way, the temperature of his flat will fall to\nzero. A crowd of sympathetic\nanti-protesters gathered, huddling\nin thick winter over l oats, but\nsoon after the meeting gaily adjourned to Southside bar.\nHell. Soc in\nThe Hellenic Society is now\nrecognised as an official IC club\nfollowing a brief grilling of\nchairman George Assimakis at\nthe SCC meeting on the 18th October. Deputy president\nMartin Lack promises a society\nnotice board in Southside and\nAssimakis envisages plenty of\nsocial events in the future, pos-sio ly culminating in a trip to\nGreece.\nThe same meeting discussed\nSCC's contribution to carnival\nand several of the clubs intend to\nplay their usual part in making it\na success. Chairman Pete Ruheman said later that he hoped\nan improved, invigorated and\nmore popular carnival fe te would\nresult.\nThe Overseas students committee reported on the recep tic yi centre which was run at the beginning of term for foreign\nfresher s. Their report stated that\nit was clear that the main problem\nthey all faced was ac com moda tion, and it was generally hoped\nthat the Union and the College\ncould start tackling this problem\nbefore the beginning of next\nsession.\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX 5\nLORD PENNEY\nAmidst almost regal proclamations from every college notice\nboard, Lord Penney took up his appointment as Rector of IC on\nMonday the 16th of October. To find out how he ticks and how he\nthinks we tick, Felix went to his utilitarian office on the second floor\nof the Beit building for a \"coming up\" interview.\nSeated comfortably around a table we asked Lord Penney,\nwhose general demean our is of\nslow, easy-going, good humour,\nthe following questions :\nQ. What kind of life did you lead\nas a student and were you\nactive in student affairs ?\nA. I was at college between 1927\nand 1931, studied maths in the\nHuxley building. I lived in\nrather poor digs and played\nsoccer and cricket for both\nRCS and IC.\nWhen asked if his legendary\n100 per cent for his degree was\nfor all papers, he said that he\ndidn't know but in his time high\nmarks were easily come by in\nMaths, by the best students.\nQ. In 1934, H.G. Wells said,\n\" The struggle to blend technical equipments with a carefully\ncherished illiteracy, an in ate oafish ness about fundamental\nthings has been well sustained.\nSouth Kensington will tell you\nproudly, \" we are not literary,\"\nand explain almost anxiously\nthat the last thing it wants to\nimpart is a liberal education.\n. . . Imperial College has no\nfirm idea of what it is and what\nit is supposed to do. That is\nto say, it has no philosophy.\nIt has no philosophical organ-is ation, no social idea, no\nrational is ed goal, to hold it\ntogether.\" Do you think,\nLord Penney, that this image\nwas, and is, fair ?\nA. There was some justification\nfor what Wells wrote in 1934.\nIn that era the effects of the\ndepression were still being felt.\nThere was little general understanding of science and technology and there was a deep\nrevulsion of war. Scientists\ncould not easily find jobs and\ncould only see themselves getting a post for which their degree would be a specialist\nqualification. However, this is\nnowhere near the mark to-day,\nand does not apply to IC. The\nyoung people of to-day are\nmuch more aware of things\naround them. I would, to-day,\nrather criticise the humanities\nand arts for their ignorance\nand disinterest in science and\ntechnology, rather than the\nother way round.\nOUR FUTURE ?\nQ. How do you foresee the development of the college to\nkeep abreast of technological\nprogress ?\nA. The purpose of the college\nmust remain to educate students in fundamentals and in\nresearch, but it is important\nthat industry and colleges of\ntechnology come closer to-get her. UNION\nQ. IC has a very active student\nunion. How do you view this\nunion as an autonomous body?\nA. I think that it is important\nthat there should be an exchange of ideas between myself\nand students and I want to\nlisten and talk to students. I think that student representation is important .although it\nneed not always be by students.\nQ. The Union has been overspending for the last few years.\nDo you consider this to be indicative of a responsible student body ?\nA. I don't know the details of the\nsituation, but I am fully in\nfavour of student activities.\nWe shouldn't curtail an active\nunion simply because we can't balance the books. I would\nlike to leave the finance side as\nfar as possible to the students,\nwho seem to be very capable.\nLord Penney refused to be\ndrawn on the subject of his connections with the field of nuclear\npower and said that he could not\noffer a considered opinion on the\nsubject of the government':; increase of fees to overseas stu-dents, so Felix went on to ask\nhim if he thought that the University of London had any relevance to IC. Lord Penney replied\nthat the same question was being\nasked in his college days but UL\nshould be thought of in some\nways as a confederation whose\nmembers had common ties in\nsuch fields as education, finance\nand building policy.\nHALLS\nQ. It is generally agreed that\nthere are too few hall places\nfor students. Are there any\nplans to improve this and can\nyou give us your views on the\nsituation ?\nA. Well, of course there are\nplans to improve the position,\nbut there are many problems\nof fin anc s and space involved.\nI think that students who are\nnot in hall lose a great deal.\nOn this .encouraging note the\ninterview ended.\nBefore him Lord Penney has,\nas I see it, two tasks\u2014on the one\nhand to maintain in the College\nthat degree of academic excellence for which it is renowned,\nproducing at the end of their\ncourses adults capable of making\nfull use of their training to lead\nthe world's advancing technology ; and on the other hand to\nfoster the improving awareness of\nteacher and taught within the col-leg e, as it is only by a mutual\nunderstanding that the ever-growing courses may be successfully absorbed in the all too short\ntime available.\nTo maintain a sense of purpose\u2014and to achieve that purpose\u2014at a time when the demands of industry are so rapidly\nchanging would tax the greatest\nof men, and with this challenge before him we of ICU\nwish Lord Penney every success\nin his time with us.\nExecutive\nAction\nFollowing the meeting on Monday, 16th October, the Union\nExecutive is'-i el the following statement on discipline:\nThe disciplinary measures open to the Executive Committee for\nmisbehaviour (especially in the Southside Bar) are:\nPut beer prices up another 2d. Ban individuals.\nStop sales of draught beer.\nClose the bar.\nThe dc tion taken will consist of:\n(1) Banning individuals from the Union. (This includes the\nUnion Buildings and facilities.) If the individual is a member of a club, that club and the relevant Clubs\nCommittee will be informed. If the ban is ignored\nfinancial support will be withdrawn from the club for\nthe period of the ban.\n(2) For misbehaviour in the Bar, the Executive Committee\nwill first ban individuals from the Bar, displaying\nnames of banned individuals, and then close the Bar\nearly, with an explanation. A lower standard of\nbehaviour will be tolerated in the Union Bar than in\nSouthside, as it is hoped to maintain the latter as a lounge bar.\nSome other subjects were also\ndiscussed at the meeting. It\ntranspired, for instance, that\u2014\n\u2014after a prolonged period of rumours\u2014Guss of Southside Bar\nfame has now replaced Howard\nas head barman at the Union.\nHoward will remain as an ordinary barman. The Union will also\nhave a set of shutters, in Southside Bar style. On the question\nof finance, it seems that the\nUnion accounts last year fell to\na deficit of \u00a31,140, which it is\nhoped will be written off by the\nCollege.\nBetween 1964 and 1967, a total\nof \u00a35,000 was drawn from the\nSports Centre fund by successive\nExecutives, while the College also\nearmarked for the Union an\nadditional \u00a31,500 in 1966. A new grant from the College, a sum of 17/6 per head of Union\nmembers, should ensure that the\nUnion account will be in the\nblack by the .end of the year.\nOther assorted topics: the card\ncheck at Hops is to be tightened\nup ; Hops are to be allowed in\nthe lounge only on occasion\n(probably twice a term); and the\nUnion Lounge Bar is to be open\non Tuesdays, Firdays, Saturdays\nand Sundays.\nSir,\nLast year, quite a lot was heard\nabout the department and year\nwhich sold the most number of\nraffle tickets for Carnival. May\nI suggest that a similar scheme be\nadopted for money collected in\ntins and perhaps a small prize be\ngiven for the department-year\nwhich collects most per head. In\nthis way even more enthusiasm\ncould be aroused than last year\nby inter-College rivalry.\nTin-collecting can become\nvery effective if people are approached and asked for rno ney.* M.B. ROGERS\nGeology II\nSir,\nCedcijtt has again offended\nsome members of the College;\nthis time it is a minority\u2014the\nwomen. Does he really want us\nto take this insult lying down?\nAlthough no survey into virgin\nterritory will be conducted\namongst Icwarians, the magnitude of objections received indicate that he's got his vital statistics\nwrong. To quote some figures: less than one per cent of the women at I.C. fail to complete their\ncourse and this is due to the usual\nreason\u2014inability to satisfy the\nexaminers' requirements.\nPlease, Colcutt, watch /our\nstep next time.\nJANE E. PEARSON,\nPresident ICWA\nSir,\nFor the second year running\nyour column has continued to\npropagate the popular misconception that to belong to the Dramatic Society means exam failure.\nEstimates vary of the average\nCollege failure rate, but 10 per\n. cent seems an accepted figure. Of\nfifty members who joined Drain.\nSoc. last September and remained\nactive throughout the year three\nfailed to return this October.\nThis six per cent were active not\nonly in DramSoc but in other\nsocieties and committees as well.\nSimilarly for the last eight years\nat least\u2014it may be more\u2014no\npresident-elect has failed to return to take up office.\nAdmittedly when one considers\nthe time that DramSoc members\nspend on providing College functions with light and sound, quite\napart from our own productions,\none might expect a higher failure\nrate\u2014but this is not the case.\nSuch a slur can only harm the\nSociety's reputation and its re-cr u it in g.I hope you will acknowledge your inaccuracy and\nhelp to stop this rumour circulating further.\nMARTIN CLARKE\nICDS President\nFELIX:\nEditors\nAt a meeting of the Felix\nBoard on Tuesday, 17th October,\na solution was found to the Editorial problem\u2014the Board appointed an Editor for each term\nof the session.

In the first\nmonth of this session they have done two really pit ive things wh;\n~h stand out as of being of importance to every mem of ICU Fii >\nthey have changed a previous ruling and invited z FELIX reporter to\nbe present at the Monday Exec, meetings. This will, I'm sure, lead to\nbetter understanding of criticised executive.decisions as in most cases\nit is true to say that an informed press is a cooper at i '\u2022\". press. Even if\nfeeling runs against a decided course of action at least t lie\" pros \" as\nwell as the \"cons\" may be stated and more open discussion\nencouraged.\nTheir second, and potentially more important move, has been\nthe issuing of the statement on discipline printed in this issue of Felix.\nIn past years we have repeatedly been faced with an executive whose\nfacade has cracked whenever it is confronted with a case of unacceptable student behaviour.\nLet it be hoped that this statement is not another empty threat\u2014\nthat when faced with a drunken dissident, as doubtless they will be,\nthey will use their full powers to show they mean business.\nAlthough their responsibility is great the onus is not entirely\nupon them; it is up to every student to help create the atmosphere we\nwant of our union.\nIf we are to have a union of which we may be proud\u2014a union\nwhere we may relax\u2014a union where we may lead a corporate and\nintegrated life\u2014we must make it quite clear that we, the members, will\nnot accept behaviour in our union that would not be tolerated\nelsewhere.\nPRESIDENTIAL ABUSE\nOver the last two years union meetings have developed into a contest of President v. the rest. This has lead to a decline in debating\nstandards and an increase in presidential abuse of the floor. For\nexample, in the session 65/66 this took the form of an apparently\nbiased running of the AGM at which the annual elections are held,\nin 66/67 the president (and chairman) deserted a meeting and already\nin this session the president has abused the floor of the union in his\nhandling of the meeting of the 16th October. There are I feel two\ncauses of complaint;firstly he allowed two of the IC vice presidents\nto continue an amusing but distracting pantomime with their water\nduring a proposal speech for the Carnival charity\u2014this was crass\nill manners and should have been stopped immediately if choosing our\ncharity is to be any thing more than a farce. Secondly his offhand\nattitude to the absence of the accounts for last session gives cause\nfor concern. Presentation of the accounts at the first union meeting\nof the session is an article of the ICU by-laws designed to keep the\nfloor of the union informed; it would have been at least courteous to\nhave volunteered an explanation early on o? why they had not yet been\naudited, and to have said when their readiness was likely.\nIf the object and conduct of a union meeting is to be serious, as\nI believe is desirable of ICI meetings, then interest will be generated\nonly if the subject and standard of debate is high. Therefore, to this\nend, I would suggest that floor and chair alike return to a more\nformal debating style and that an effort be made to find an organised\nopposition to general motions, as it is hard to get raging discussion of\nan unopposed motion.\nMIKE\nWithin a month the IC mascot, Mike, should again be restored\nto its seat of honour in the union lounge, to start its fifth week on display since its inauguration early last session. Having been bandied\naround London and suffered a peculiarly unpleasant stay at UC\nencased in concrete it will indeed by a happy change for members of\nIC to get a glimpse of him.\nWhether or not one believes in mascot ry is irrelevant; if we have\na mascot (for which incidentally the union has paid \u00a335 and others\nconsiderably more) we may as well look after it. It is not for instance\na cunning defensive ploy to leave our beloved (?) micrometer\nunguarded in a room with two unlocked exits as was the case, we are\ntold, at the beginning of this session. It was fortunate indeed that it\nwas found by two college patriots who removed it to a place of safe\nkeeping. Learn your lesson, you members of W.H.O.; next time it\nmay be some marauding kings man or polytechnic ian who carries Mike\noff.\nFinally then, gentlemen of IC, be upstanding and steadfast in the\ndefence of your mascot\u2014be not thwarted by the powers of evil, (UC\nand the like), for if Mike is again mislay ed we must admit ignominious\ndefeat and adopt that truly foolproof plinth as our piece d 'honneur.\nVino d's Views Imperial College\nLondon, S.W.7 Internal 2881\nTel.

As a member of Council\nand of its External Affairs Committee he has the chance to put\nhis ideas and opinions into pra c tice. Here he writes about the\nways in which he feels the Union\ncould be improved.\nIt has been repeated over and\nover again that I.C. Union administration has lost its touch\nwith the students whom it is supposed to represent. I believe in it\nto a large extent, although it is\nnot entirely the administration's fault. As a rough guess not more\nthan 800 students are in any way\nassociated with Union activities.\nHence a concerted effort has to\nbe made to attract as many of the\nother 3,000 members.\nPublicity\nThe Union must ensure that\nminutes of its meetings, council\nmeetings and resolutions of special importance adopted by committees must be publicised as\nmuch as possible by displaying on\nall departmental notice boards. A display in the Union building is\njust not sufficient. Attendance at\na number of Union meetings\nbarely reaches the quorum stage\nThis may be so partially because\nmany students do not wish to\nmiss the General Studies programme of their choice. It\nwould be worth a try not to\nore anise any other lectures when\nUnion meetings are held. This in\nno way implies any criticism of\nthe General Studies programme,\nbut I think that most of the students who take the trouble to go\nto General Studies would be the\nones who would also be interested\nin attending Union meetings.\nI.C. Lodging Bureau\nIt has been pointed out that\nsince a large number of students\nstay a long distance away from\nthe College, it is difficult for them\nto participate fully in College\nactivities. One way by which\nthe situation could be eased would\nbe the establishment of a College\nLodgings Bureau. It is common\nknowledge that there are literally\nthousands of student lodgings in\nareas within walking distance of\nthe College. However, many students complain that the University of London Lodgings Bureau\nhas very few addresses in areas\nnear I.C.A body like this, which\nhas to deal with many thousands\nof students from all over London,\ncannot seriously be expected to\ncater specially for students in\nSouth Kensington. This void can\nbe effectively filled by the establishment of an I.C. lodgings\nbureau. To help with the running expenses of such a bureau,\nsome suitable arrangement may\nperhaps be reached with the\nRoyal College of Music and, the\nRoyal College of Art.\nP.G. s The fact that SO few P.G. s come\nat all to the Union should\nsuggest the need of a special effort to interest them. It should\nnot be forgotten that the majority\nof P.G. s come from foreign\ncountries and therefore some\nmeasure of hesitancy and reluctance should not be unexpected.\nIt is necessary for the Union to\norganise special meetings and get\ntogether s( even dinners for married P.G. s!) to cater for them.\nThe Union and constituent College officials should try to contact\nthem personally by visiting them\nin their departments. This is,\nundoubtedly, very hard work; but\nI do feel that unless an attempt\nis made to contact them on a personal basis, there can be little\nhope of participation from that\nquarter.\nExternal Affairs\nFinally a word about external\naffairs. There is a tendency for\nsome students to dismiss the\nexternal affairs aspect of College\nactivities as \" politics.\" Surely a student is much more than a data feeding machine and he cannot be\nexpected to behave as if he has\nno obligations as a member of an\ninternational community (whether\nsome like it or not is another\nquestion!). Let us not forget that\ncriticism and discussion are very\nhealthy signs of an alive, challenging society.\nSir,\nOn Tuesday, 24th October, ,an\nan any mou s duplicated sheet was\ndistributed in the Union. This\nwas concerned with Vietnam\nWar Demonstration on Sunday,\n22nd of October, in which a number of I.C. people took part. In\nparticular, it alleged police brutality in Grosvenor Square. I was present at the Embassy and\nthought the police acted with\ngreat restraint. The trouble was\nin fact started by a group of\ndemonstrators attempting to\nbreak through the police cordon\nby physical violence. The use of\nflour bombs by certain demonstrators shows that they came\nprepared to start trouble. If\npeople assault the police\" they\nshould not be surprised when the\npolice retaliate. Thirty policemen were injured in what cain\nonly be described as a riot, and\nI fail to see how this serves the\ncause of peace. To accuse the\npolice of defending US Imperialism is fatuous. The police\nwere defending the occupants and\nproperty of the Embassy from\nwhat had degenerated into a mob. The document ends with\nthe following: \" Forty-seven\npeople have been arrested. Several police and demonstrators are\nin hospital all because of L.B. J.\"I would suggest that it is all\nbecause of the irresponsible behaviour of a small group of\ndemonstrators, \u2022 and I am\nashamed that anyone from IC\ncould take part in or condone\nsuch action.\nMARTIN BLAND.\nCOL CUT T You all know about the happy\nyak\u2014the who ?\u2022\u2014in the Isle of\nMan who thought his wife was\ntoo woolly. \" Before I get down\n(up?) to making love to you,\"\nhe said, \" You go and get\nbugged.\" \" Er ?\" queried his\nwife. \"No, just bugged,\" he\nsaid. So his wife went and had\nher fur rho the aten and when she\ncame back, hubby yak was dead\npleased. \"Keith Guy will just\nlove that coat,\" he explained,\n\" and anyway, I didn't want our\nheirs cut off.\"\nAnd among other ideas that\nKeith Guy just seems to love is\nSpastic Dairy Pail\u2014flowing, no\ndoubt, with the milk of human\nkindness. A disco headache with\nits light bazookas aimed at\nthought reforming you into believing you're the greatest\u2014and\naren't you, when you're purple\nand pink together ? Man, those\nhops ain't hip no longer.\nLet's all be beautiful like the\nswing Ents Committee and switch\non every Friday night. There's only one small problem : it's not\none of size\u2014hell, we could all\nswitch jn to another and who'd notice ; it isn't one of organisation\u2014 you forget we've the\ngreatest Ents Committee of all\ntime. It's really that the\nEnts Committees want to be\npart of something select\u2014they've\ntried long enough. And so there\nare to be restrictions on those who\nmay enter this cy there an centre\nof perpetual pleasure. \"This,\"\nsays Guy, \"will enable us to restrict membership.\" I suppose\nthis is in the best traditions of\nImperial College. And I suppose Guy, though he made Council is still narked at the alliances\nwhich in the past have restricted\nhim from getting the I.C. Presidency. So a little bit of empire-building on the side is all in the\ngame. I mean Tony Duke, whom\nthey dragged in to oppose Guy,\nwas a nice fellow. Wasn't he ?\nPerhaps all Guy wanted was to\nbe sub-warden of Weeks.' It's just the job for someone who\ncouldn't keep the Union he presided over in order.\nBut it's always best (isn't it,\nMr. Seaford ?) to allow those\nwho've had it already to have\nsome more. Perhaps Guy just\nwants to keep the rugby players\nout. Okay, so we all hate the\nrugby club\u2014but that's no reason\nto keep them out\u2014not so as to\nkeep out any old Union member.\nAre you a member of the hierarchy ? Switdh on, love in and\nfreak out every Friday. And if\nyou're not\u2014well, tough.\nBut there are some other guys\nwith quaint, up-to-date ideas.\nLike Chris O 'Donnell. Suave,\nfast-talking Father O 'Donnell\nwith his Stateside T shirt, who\nguides the prelates of Guilds\nto further sins against I.C.\" Stronger constituent Unions\nmeans a stronger I.C. Union,\" he\nconfesses. I get it fast\u2014divided\nwe stand and united we fall. Like\nif three people attempt to urge\ntheir followers to greater things,\none may succeed. ' So let's put\neverything in triplicate \u2014 Comrade Ruhemann should love that\n\u2014and throw in a joint Union for\ngood effect.\nBut the effect is bad: who\ncares about Union No. 4 ?\nWhere will Ray Phillips be on\nMorphy Day ? Sitting alone in\nthe Union Office, talking to himself in an outlandish voice ? And\nwith the strange two-faced ness of\nour three colleagues, the three\nconfesses. I get it fast\u2014divided\ndiscussions on academic matters.\nWe must admit to the logic of\nthese Unions with their concern\nfor throwing mud-pies for real on\nMorphy Day at their fellow-stu-dents : and metaphorically in the\na cede mic sub-committees at their\nprofessors. It's all good for staff-student relations\u2014and how many\ndo we have together ? They may\nargue that we shouldn't take life\ntoo seriously\u2014after all, we won't get out of it alive.\nNo, it's like the nurse in the\nBeatle rhyme:\n\" She feels as if she's in a play,\n\" She is, anyway.\"\nExcept that our three Colleges\nare playing a farce.\n\n"

UNIMPRESSIVE LORDS AT\nCOMMEM. DAY\nInquorate meeting\nWhere is Mike?\nGarga elected to Council\nThe Leukaemia Research Fund is to be I.C.s carnival charity ;\nthe Union Executive are to tighten up on discipline; and Vinod\nGarga is to be the sixth floor rep. on council. These main points\nemerged from the first I.C. Union meeting of the year. It was a quiet\nin quo rate affair, with an attendance of perhaps 250.\nThe meeting began three minutes late, with Mike Tait still adjusting a tie he had hastily borrowed from the floor, and the minutes\nand letters to the Union were read out while he discreetly munched his\npicnic lunch\u2014 a fair comment on Mooney meals. Among the letters\nwas one from Frank Morris, ex-president of the Wooden Horse Club.\n\" Two I.C. patriots \" had removed an unguarded Mike, from Committee room A to demonstrate its vulnerability and he apologized for\nits temporary disappearance. After this came the election for floor\nrep on council to fill the place vacated by C.C. Parker's exam failure.\nVinod Garga, proposed by Andy Jordan, was unopposed.\nNew Associates being presented\nto the Chairman of the\nGoverning Body.\nCarnival Charity\nThree charities were nominated\nfor the Carnival Fund. Ian Wells\nspoke on behalf of the Cancer\nResearch Fund, Chris O 'Donnell\nfor the Leukaemia Research.\nFund, while the Chairman of\nI.R.C. Joan Ruddock, delivered\nan impassioned and fluent speech\nfor Andy Jordan's\" mixed bag \"\nof Oxfam and ICSASAF. As far\nas could be judged, the Leukaemia Fund was voted in by a large\nmargin, although the exact results\nwere not announced, Its merits\nare twofold; it is readily acceptable to the general public, but has\nnot been as yet overexposed.\nDiscipline\nRay Phillips put aside his mood\nof gay banter, in revealing the\nnew disciplinary policy. The full\ntext of the \" ban-the-boozers\"\nmeasures are given elsewhere in\nFELIX; in general, the meeting\nappeared to be in agreement.\nAs for last year's accounts,\u2014\nwhich should, under union byelaws be presented at the first\nunion meeting of the next year\u2014\nthey have not yet appeared. They\nshould also, under these bye-laws,\nbe presented to the Rector by the\nend of October; but whether they\nwill be is another matter.\nMartin lacks\ninitiative\nIt is reported that one day the\nweek before last five college\nmembers were passing by the\nillegal subterranean route into\nSouthside when they were observed by a security guard\u2014four\nescaped unidentified, but the\nfifth, \"Mike Smith\" (??), was\ncaught and \" severely reprimanded.\" Mackman\nRCS Ents\nBob Mackman was sworn in as\nRCS President on the 24th of\nOctober at one of the liveliest\nRCSU meetings for some time.\nAs a result of vigorous and\nwell organised campaigns by both\ncandidates there was a high poll\ngiving a final result of 442 votes\nfor Mr. Mackman and 372 for\nFrank Fuchs.\nAfter the Union meeting Bob\nsaid that he thought that this\nyear's Union would be healthy\nand strong both with regard to\nserious matters and to more lighthearted affairs\u2014the latter being\namply demonstrated in the Union\nmeeting. Frank was naturally\ndisappointed at having lost but\nintends to. put forward some of\nhis policies at future Union\nmeetings.\nMike Tait, the Vice-President,\nopened the meeting and quickly\nswept aside most of the serious\nbusiness\u2014the presentation to him\nof a wooden spoon appropriated\nfrom \" some women's college,\"\u2014\nso that he could announce the\nelection result and subject the\nnew president to a long and tortuous inaugurate ceremony. For\nthis Mackman had to strip and\ndon a green towel\u2014the ceremonial uniform\u2014run three times\nround the lecture theatre holding\nTheta aloft, enter a drinking contest (which he won), with champion beer s will er Steve Moffat, be\npainted in RCS colours, make an\nimpromptu speech about carrots\nand, after adopting an extremely\nvulnerable position on the lecture\ntheatre bench, shout a Kangela,\nwhich was not very rousing, and\ninaccurate.\nAfter the hilarity had faded,\nMalcolm \" Spooks\" Duckett,\nChairman of RCS Ents got up to\nexplain that he had tried unsuccessfully to resign. He had done\nVictorious\ndisheartened\nthis because he was disillusioned\nwith RCSU as a result of the lack\nof active support the Ents Committee had received in the past.\nHe complained that too many\npeople, for instance FELIX, were\ntoo inclined to criticising and not\nenough to helping. He did not\nsee why all the work of the Union\nshould be loaded on to a few\npeople.\nThe meeting then swung back\ninto its light-hearted and frivolous\nmood of a few minutes before\nwith the announcement of the\nsequel of the \" Queen of Jez\"\nThe gentlemen of the audience\nwere as reticent and shy as the\nladies had been the previous week\nuntil several beefy females started\nto haul members of the Exec,\nfrom their seats. The competitors\nparaded across the front of the\ntheatre displaying their knees after\nthe fashion of the Mr. ICWA\ncontest ranged from Jeff Warren\nclad in rather less than trousers,\nto Pete Hall, Chairman of RCS\nclubs committee with the knob-b lies t knees on view. Pete Hall,\nwas therefore judged the winner\nand awarded the title \"King of\nJez.\"\nUC S ASAF It was reported in the Guardian\non Tuesday 24th October that\nU.C. has started a U.C. S. A.S.A.F.( University College South African\nStudent Appeal Fund.)\nWhat should LC.'s re acd on be\nto this revolutionary idea? Should\nwe send them the \u00a3150 so far\ncollected for I.C.S. A.S.A.F. or\njust advise them in a paternal\nway against the whole scheme?\nThe fragile basis tor the Commemoration Day ceremony broke\ndown under the weight of two\nuninspiring speeches by the Rector and Lord Kings Norton, the\nspecial visitor, last Thursday\nafternoon.\nAn assembly of 2.000 or so\u2014\nconspicuous tor the sparsity ot\nstudents not being presented\u2014\nwatched the splendour of the\nprocession of dignitaries to the\nplatform while the choir sang the\nstirring \" Gaudeamus Igitur\";\nheard Martin Lack, the student\norator, read the proclamation;\nwatched the ACGFs presented to\nthe chairman of the Delegacy and\nthe ARCS's, ARSM's and DICs\nto Lord Sherfield, Chairman of\nthe Governing Body; heard the\ncitations and watched the presentation of diplomas to Lady Linstead, honorary Diplomate of\nImperial College, Professor\nBlackett, Sir Charles Goodeve,\nProfessor Sir Ewart Jones, Professor McCrea, Dr. Mitchell and\nMr. Newby, all Fellows of Imperial College.\nSo far so good ; a bit of a drag\nduring the presentation of Associates and DIC's, watching an\nendless stream of people walk to\nthe middle of the platform, stop,\nand walk on, broken only by the\noccasional lady, whose curtsey receives a doff of the cap.\nThen came the Rectors' ad-dress, surely the shortest in\nboth time and content for many\nyears. Briefly he said that we\nhave almost come to the end of\nthe era of rapid expansion and\nare now entering a new one of\nconsolidation. In this era the\nmain effort must be to work more\nclosely with industry, to train\nscientist and technologists for in-dust ry, and to stimulate a greater\nflow of ideas between the two.\nOn the occasion of the Rector's first official appearance one would\nhave expected a rather more\ncomprehensive idea of the direction in which he intends to lead\nImperial College.\nA pleasant interlude followed\nwhile the choir sang an excerpt\nfrom Cantata No. 21 by Bach\nand the Chairman of the Governing Body was welcoming Lady\nLinstead, Lord Penney and the\nspecial visitor, Lord Kings\nNorton spoke for only about a quarter of an hour. In many\nways his theme was an extension\nof the Rector's, that we must\ntrain more scientists for industry\nHowever his main interest was in\nthe creation of an e ducat ive structure which would channel\nthe right minds into pure or applied science or into manage-ment. He envisaged a very much\nbroader education at the secondary school level, with little or no\nspecial is ation until university.\nThis he hopes will reduce the gap\nin understanding between artists\nand scientists, so making them\nmore tolerant of and co-operative\nwith one another. His other\nmain point was that we are not\nbeing selective enough in our pursuit of scientific knowledge. He\nbelieves that we should be much\nmore selective in our targets of\napplied research, carefully weighing the benefits which wit! accrue\nagainst the cost of the project,\nand more selective in the people\nengaged for pure research.\nHe summed up his speech:\n\" My thesis, broadly, is that we\nabsorb knowledge too narrowly',\nin our youth, and that we extend!.;\nits boundaries too carelessly late f; on.\nLucid as this speech was, he\npresented no original ideas, nor\ndid he elaborate on the well-known ideas that he did present.\nIn fact it consisted of a succession of vague generalities along\nthe lines just mentioned, offering\nnot a scrap of evidence to support\nhis views.\nThe indifference of the two\nmain speeches leads one to ask\nwhat is the purpose of Commemoration Day ? The origins of it\nhave little relevance to the present day (it commemorates the\nvisit of King George VI and\nQueen Elizabeth in 1945) serving,\nso it seems, merely as an excuse\nfor a presentation ceremony. But\nis it just a presentation ceremony\nwith a couple of speeches thrown\nin to add weight ? Surely not.\nThe Rector's address is his only\nofficial annual delivery to the college as a whole, and as such is\nan important, occasion in its own\nright. One would expect at least\na general outline of policies.\nNo wonder so few students\nattend when the occasion seems\nto have so little relevance to\nthem.\n\n"

Following\nICWA's lead with ICWords, Guilds, Mines and RCS have produced\nGUILDSPOT, GENTLEMEN OF MINES and MACKMANIAlong may they live.\nGUILD SPOT Welcome to our first Guilds\ncolumn of this year which we are\ndelighted to open by categorically\nstating that Guilds still have\nSpanner. Despite rumours to the\ncontrary, which even reached the\npages of FELIX, Guilds never\nlost Spanner\u2014certainly not to\nsuch an outlandish spot as\nNorthern Poly ! Somehow, some-where, someone must have\nstarted this fiendish rumour, the\ndetails of which are still not clear\nand which struck dread into our\nspanner bearers who were in imminent danger of tarring and\nfeathering! Actually, much\npraise in due to our mascot men\nand their team of maniac car-drivers who by their ingenuity\nand timing defeated all attempts\nby R.C.S. and Mines to capture\nSpanner.\nThe Guilds Freshers Dinners\nare now over. We hope everyone\nwho came enjoyed themselves,\nparticularly as the majority of the\ndinners this year were mixed !\nThis is a very pleasant change in\nGuilds and just in casa there is\nanyone who hasn't realised it yet,\nGuilds have twelve girl fresher s this year\u2014so the total number of\ngirls is now trebled. There has\napparently been a similar increase in R.C.S. \u2014'this, of course,\nmakes no difference to their chant\nfor which, I am told, the correct\nbeginning is \" Ladies of R.C.S., are we in good voice ?\"\nThe Guilds calendar is pretty\nfull in the next couple of weeks\n\u2014 to-day of course being the\nevent of the year\u2014MORPHY\nDAY ! So Guildsmen assemble\nin your cast of thousands, cheer\nour boat crews to victory and\nthen let battle commence !\nRemember also that we need\nlots of support to get Bo off to a good start on the Brighton Run\nnext Sunday\u2014and of course to\nwelcome Bo in Brighton at the\nMotor Club lunch.\nThe next big day is the Lord\nMayor's Show on November 11th. \u2014we have been asked to supply\nprogramme sellers, so let Guilds\nhave your names for both events\nas soon as possible.\nGENTLEMEN OF MINES Under the capable and enthusiastic leadership of President Ian\nWells, Mines Union has got off to\na very active start this session.\nThere has been a good turnout to\nthe fresher s' dinners, though not\nthe 100 per cent hoped for. This\nis a pity as the fresher s do get\ntheir meal and entertainment free\n\u2014and only have to drink the beer\nand attempt to drain the yard of\nale in return.\nNew ideas, some thought up in\nprevious sessions but never put\ninto practice and some from this\nyear, have now come into action.\nA Hot Drink vending machine,\nwill shortly be installed in the\nMines Building\u2014this in response\nto a survey conducted at the beginning of term. A new notice\nboard, for use by the Sports Club\nand badly needed for years, has\nnow been erected. The Union\nOffice is at last in use, and Bar\nSocials, held on Wednesday evenings in the Union, are now in full\nswing and give Minesmen a chance to meet over a quiet (?)\npint.\nSport is flourishing with a lot of\nnew talent and the steady support\nof the old lags. Mines should win\nthe race on Morphy Day again\nand the end of season should see\nthe Engineers' and Sparke's Cups\nand the Bottle once again back in\nMines.\nVisits to foreign Mining Schools\nare off to an early start. Mines\nare being represented in Delft,\nHolland and Trondheim, Norway,\nin early November. Preparations\nfor the return visit in December\nare well under way.\nThis may well be a year to\neclipse all others.\nFor the progressive element amongst I.C. students, Felix\nexamines three of the outfits on the \" avant garde \" bandwagon.\nSHADES OF THE\nUNDERWORLD\nThe Experimental Arts Lab. is exactly what it says it is, or so it\nreckons. Hoping to succeed where Indica and others failed, as a solvent centre for original art-work, their primary hang-up is ade-qu ate finance. However, even if you're broke, you're welcome, especially if you've got ideas or things that might help them create a\" groovy environment.\"\nThe \" lab \" consists of a small theatre, a cinema and concert\narea, an art and environmental area, a bookshop, a restaurant and a home for a film production unit. You can visit any day. except\nMonday.\n182 Drury Lane.\nProcess\nThe Process exists to discuss\nanything, but the subjects tend to\nbe predictable. LSD, Road to\nHeaven or Chemical death ? for\ninstance, and their 3-cornered\nintellectual battle, \" Game of the\nGods,\" featuring the voices of\nJehovah, Lucifer and Satan, each\ngiven an evening to put over his\ncase. The views of the Gods are\nexpensive, however, and it will\ncost you 7/6 to hear Satan close\nthe trilogy this Friday. Most of\nthis, no doubt, goes to pay for\nthe Processes' excessively sumptuous headquarters in Mayfair,\nsub sidi sed also by their Process\nSessions\u2014-a course designed to\nincrease one's personal communication with others and to improve\none's self-awareness, ending with\nevenings of courageous self-dis-co very, finding blinding visions of\nGod, coupled with the stench of\ninfinite corruption . . . the blurb\nsays it much better than I, please\nget one (they're free) from the\nProcess, 2, Balfour PL, W. l. Yoko Ono\nYoko Ono\u2014J life, \\ space exhibition at the Lisson Gallery,\nBell Street, N.W. I. The usual\nYoko Ono nothing ? It's difficult\nto make objective comments except that the exhibition is a comment on our \\ communication\nand Jr experiences and consists of\n4 environments, including one,\ntitled Back-yard, which turns out\nto be exactly that (including\nRain, courtesy of Yoko Ono, if\nyou're lucky). Yoko Ono (of\n\" Bottoms \" fame) says she attempts to \"make music within\nyour own mind \" which is perhaps her way of describing what\nartists have always done, any-way, if you don't get too cynical\nit can happen. Closing date Nov.\n14, don't miss it.\nFELIX\nMACK MAN IA\nOf course with everyone so involved in the Presidential election,\nthere's been plenty of stirring\ngoing on on behalf of each of the\ncandidates. However, that's all\nold hat now, and since we have,\nat last, a real live President, things\nshould settle down to their more\nusual steady pace.\nWhat did you all think of\n\" Spooks\" and his dramatic ap-peal? It was truly sincere, not a put-up job, and he reports that a few stony hearts were touched, so\nfor these and any other interested\npeople he hopes to be getting the\ndesigns for the flats soon and will\nbe asking for help in painting\nthem via the notice boards.\nIf you haven't been put off by\n\" Spooks\" there still remain a few union posts.

    "content": "FELIX\nSPORTS NEWS1 st Soccer XI Retain\nUnbroken Record\nA function of the sports page is to report on news, views and in\nfact anything worth mentioning about sport in I.C. It is the responsibility of the athletics clubs to submit news of their activities, whatever it might be. Everything, and in fact anything, , II be con-side red, and it is hoped that, eventually, all the sports clubs will be\nrepresented in their respective proportion.\n1st XV Crush Beckenham\nI.C. Ist XV 29\u2014BECKENHAM 1st XV 3\nSaturday saw a marked improvement in the whole of the I. C.1st XV. Despite rather damp conditions the team got quickly into\ntheir stride at Beckenham. We were fortunate to get an early converted try due to some slack tackling near the opposition scrum, and\nwere soon on the way to amassing a good score.\nBeckenham resisted well but the sheer speed and determination of\nthe I.C. back row brought Clive Summerton his first try. This was\nfollowed by a try by Beckenham, which we gave away due to some\npoor defence. Wefinishedthe first half with an orthodox passing\nmovement to the left wing for Rog. Chappell to plough his way over.\nAfter a lapse at the beginning of the second half, if we scored two\nfurther good tries and John Lum boosted the score with some fine\nplace kicks. We left the field, just as it started to rain, worthy winners\nat 29-3.\nThe whole club had a block fixture with Beckenham with the\nEx-Ists, Bl's and B2's also winning, the other teams just losing.\nIt is ver v pleasing to see a great deal of team spirit being generated in the lower teams and I am sure this will take us all to some\ngood victories.\nBOB PINE (Capt.).\nSquash\nClub\nExpanding\nThe I.C. Squash Club is expanding and becoming increasingly active in anticipation of\nhaving its own courts when the\nSports Centre is completed.\nLast year our first team played\n24 team matches and won 21.\nThis year we are playing in the\nLondon University League and\nhave entered four competition\nteams\u2014one in Division I, one in\nDivision II and two in Division\nIII. One of the latter teams has\nbeen allocated to girls at I.C. wanting to play competition\nsquash.\nBad Start\nThefirstshave not started well\nin the League, losing to University\nCollege and to the College of\nEstate Management,, but they\nhave won a practice match against\nRAF - College, Cranwell. The\nseconds have done better by defeating the Institute of Education\nwithout losing a game, and then\nthe Institute of Cancer Research.\nThe other teams have not played\nyet.\nSTUART CANNING\n(Squash Committee)\nWater Polo\nI.C. Ist team v Q.M. C. This match was the first of the\nnew academic year and proved to\nbe far from encouraging for I.C. Theoretically, I.C. should easily\nhave won this match in spite of\nthe fact that in the Q.M. C. team\nwas an ex-Great Britain inter-national, but I.C.'s play was too\nscrappy and although close the\nmatch was eventually lost. The\nonly bright spot was \"Shorty\"\nRandall's three goals which at\none stage seemed to be swinging\nthe match I.C.'s way, but shot-shy forwards and slack defensive\nmarking took their toll.\nThis match is better forgotten\nalthough potentially I.C. have a team capable of sweeping the\nboard in the U.L. U. honours.\nThe final score for the record was\n4\u20145.\nDown on the range; a rifle club member lines up on his target.\nGliding club members prepare for a flight; a feature on the Gliding\nClub will appear in the next issue of Felix.\nI.C.4 \u2014U.C.2 The 1st XI continued then-successful early season, run, by\nbeating LJ.C. at Harlington last\nWednesday. It was a somewhat\nscrappy game, both apparently\nstill trying to sort out tactics at\nthe start of the season.\nThe game started off with I.C. doing all the attacking, but no\ngoals came. After a quarter of\nan hour U.C. gradually came into\nthe game and eventually scored\nafter 25 minutes with a very well\ntaken goal from 20 yards to take\nthe lead. Shortly after a clever\nrun down to left wing Geoff Keer,\na first year who is giving tremendous punch to I.e. created an\nequal is erA hard low centre was\ntoo much for the goalkeeper to\nhold and Male Whittle hooked the\nball into the roof of the net. Just\non half time an almost identical\nmove by I.C. gave them the lead,\nagain a long run and hard accurate centre by Keer, again the\ngoalkeeper failed to hold and\ncentre-forward Whittle made no\nmistake in converting.\nIn the second half U.C. fought\nvery hard and for the first 20 min.\nkept I.C. under constant pressure.\nThe I.C. defence however was too\nstrong for their forward line,\ncentre-half Brian Hall, another\nexceptional 1st year, controlled the\nmiddle both in the air and on the\nground with ease. But then in\nkeeping with I.C.'s infamous inconsistency U.C. scored from a corner with the I.C. defence completely at 6's and 7's. After this I.C. appeared to\ngather their senses and commenced to take control of the game.\nAll eleven players combined very\nwell and numerous good moves\ncreated, by law of averages per-hap s, two more goals. Stan Lister\nput a hard low ball down the\nmiddle which Phil Hopwood\ncleverly stepped over sending the\ndefence the wrong way, and Geoff\nKeer after a bit of scrambling\nscored a very good goal. Shortly\nafter, Brian Hall split the defence\nwith a clever flick and Lister\nmade no mistake in scoring number four.\nAll in all, a satisfactory performance by I.C. and let's hope\nthat early season spirits and success will continue throughout the\nyear and that soccer cups will\ncome to I.C. this year.\nCross Country\nULU Honours\nImperial College gained nine\nUniversity team places after the\ntrial at Parliament Hill Fields last\nSaturday. Barry Jones, aP.G. fresher and New Zealand three\nmile champion finished second\nonly ten yards behind the winner.\nHe was well backed up by the\nrest of the I.C. team with Nick\nBarton, Tony Mason, Ian Jones,\nHoward Smith, Ashley Deans,\nDave Dallman, Alan Mowatt and\nNorman Morrison gaining University team places.\nI.C. are now lying second in\nthe London Colleges League I and are going all out to win.\nThere should also be a good battle\nin League II with the III and IV\nteams keen to gain promotion. If\nthe fighting spirit of the team\nmaintains its present level, this\nwill be its best season for many\nyears.\nASHLEY DEANS\nHockey\n5 Teams\nTwo trials were held this year,\nand it was apparent from them\nthat the club would be able to\nfield some strong teams. This\nhas in fact turned out to be the\ncase and so far the 2nd,3 rd and\n4th elevens have met with not a little success.\nSince there are nearly 80 members in the Club it is hoped to run\na regular 5th XI, and fixtures are\nnow being arranged. Therefore\nit is vitally important that members co-operate with the committee by filling up the availability\nlist as far ahead as possible since\nthere is no point in arranging\nfixtures for non-existent teams.\nThe First Eleven included 6\nmembers from last year's eleven.\nAlthough at the time of writing\nthe results consist of draws with\nGuy's Hospital and Southampton\nUniversity, and a narrow defeat\nby West Essex, it is felt that success will come once the team has\nsettled down.\nFinally, let us hope that the U.L. Challenge Cup which so narrowly\neluded our grasp last year will in\nfact come to I.C. this year.\nNovember 5th will\nbe chilly\nBuy your College scarf\nfrom the Bookstall now\nIt helps to make a very cosy\ntwosome\nPublished by Rory Redmaync on behalf of FELIX BOARD Imperial College, London, S.W.7. and printed by WEST LONDON OFFSET CO.. 86, I.i l lie Rd., London, S.W.6.

    "content": "FELIX 7\nIvor' s'6 a David Martin is a lecturer in Sociology in the London School of\nEconomics, so I suspect he knows what he is talking about when he\naddresses \"the general reader \" in his book \" A Sociology of English\nReligion \" (published by Heinemann, 1967). Here is a sentence from\nhis book : \" Let it be said quite simply that in the course of a year\nnearly one out of every two Britains will have entered a church, not\nfor an event in the life cycle or for a special personal or civic occasion,\nbut\" for service within the ordinary pattern ot institutional religion.''\nA truly staggering thought,\u2014but one which will make the \"Jeremiahs\"\nwho bewail the \" Christian decline \" wince!\nIt may be that your clever sixth-form science master has told you\nthat \" Scientists don't believe in God \" and things to that effect. You\nmay have had some sort of connection with the \" local church \" back\nhome, and in the vastness and anonymity and im personality of your\nnew surroundings you may be inclined to drift into an aimlessness\nas the practice of your faith is concerned.\nChristian community in Imperial\nCollege is composed of the Christian Union, the Methodist,\nRoman Catholic and Anglican\n(C of E) chaplaincy.\nWilliam Temple\u2014a former distinguished Archbishop of Canterbury\u2014once remarked that the\nChurch was the only society\nwhich existed solely to serve the\nneeds of those who are outside its\nmembership. I should very much\nhope that in Imperial College the\nChurch is seen to serve the needs\nof all the members of the College.\nThe entire College exists as a unit\n\u2014domestic, administrative, academic staff; post graduates;\nundergraduates; porters; etc. etc.\nChristianity at I.C.I just want you to know that in\nImperial College there exists a vigorous, articulate and engaging\ncommunity of Christian men and\nwomen, who have no illusions\nwhatever of the moral courage\nand integrity required to persist in\nthe Christian faith. This community of faith is to be found in\nevery Hall of Residence, in every\ndepartment of the College, and its\nmembers will be found to be\ndeeply and genuinely engaged in\nall the areas of college life\u2014\nsports, academic, social, political\nand whatever else is going!f. The\nThe Church is set within the entire College to serve as its willing\nservant. We are not in the College to further mere \" spiritual\"\nends. We are in the College to\n\" human is e\" the entire structure.\nIf you want to learn how to grow\nand develop as a HUMAN BEING, then join the Church in the\nCollege.\nHuman beings care and care\neven when it costs them greatly to\ndo so. There can be no area of\nCollege life which the church\ncan regard as outside her task.\nI hope that you will feel perfectly\nfree to make use of the facilities\nand opportunities provided by the\nchurch in the College to further\n\" human is ation.\" If you happen to be a Christian,\nthen be up and doing. The Cpllege/\nneeds the church and you can\ndo your best to contribute to its\nlife. If you are not a Christian\nhave no fear of being press uri sed into a\" religious \" groove. The\nonly groove the church can operate in is the \" human groove.\" In\nImperial College you have the\nfreedom and the facilities of leading your own life. You haven't got your parents, your schoolmasters or even your local vicar\nto breathe down your neck! This\nfreedom can result either in an\naimless drifting into complete\npurposeless ness or it could be\ndirected into a deep and genuine\nsense of human responsibility. I believe that 'the church in the\nCollege can be a great help in\nshaping your choice in this matter.\nSo it's up to you!\nLit Soc's Reactionaries\nBy restricting its intended discussion to European Reactionary\nWriters, the re-formed Literary\nSociety at a recent meeting succeeded in confining its actual discussion to the realms of politics\nand philosophy. The foundation\nfor the evening was laid by M. Jean Conrad, who traced the evolution of reactionary thought from\nthe Renaissance period through\nthe French Revolution and up to\nthe last World War; he was particularly successful in illustrating\nthe influences of the reactionaries\non one another. In the lengthy\ndiscussion which followed, an attempt was made at categorising\nthem in order to discuss the roots\nof the movement, but this was\nnot pursued as it was believed\nimpossible.\nTinkers at IC Folk\nICWords: On Virgins\nDoes Colcutt speak from experience when he says that less\nthan 60 per cent of l Cw arians are virgins? 1 think this is unlikely.\nWhat business is it of Colcutt's anyway? It is the attitude of him and\nothers like him that give I.C.a bad name among women. Just\nbecause there are so few women it doesn't mean that all girls are\nnymphomaniacs. It is common knowledge that headmistresses advise\ntheir \" gels \" against coming to I.C. Probably because of the large\nexcess of men and tales of \" Over 40 per cent of the women aren't virgins \" etc. etc. The shortage of women at I.C. is not only due to\n\" all science \" and difficult courses but also to many girls being\n\" warned \" off. If people like Colcutt would stop making such gross\ngeneralizations everyone would realize that ICwarians are the same as\nother undergraduate women and perhaps our female population would\nincrease.\nIClothes\nWe go to College in the heart\nof Kensington which is full of\nboutiques (and not all expensive),\nwe get a\" reasonable \" grant and\nthis is probably the only time in\nour lives when we can dress\nexactly as we like, then why, oh\nwhy do ICwarians dress so un-originally? There are exceptions\nI know and to them I apologise\nbut so many wear a sweater and\nskirt in \" sensible \" colours. Why\nnot splash out and buy or make a new outfit (ICWA has a sewing\nmachine). Wear it to College instead of saving it for best and\ncause a sensation!\nMr. 1CW A Finally latest news of Mr.\nICWA. Nominations were very\nslow in coming and in fact at the\nmoment only two people have\nbeen fully nominated and sec on ded. These are Pete Franklin\nand C.R. Penycate. Other nominees who have yet to be seconded\nare Dick James, A. Friend and\nI.E. Wells. There should have\nbeen a better response than this.\nAre no members of the Rugby\nClub going to stand? Nominations must be in by Nov. 5th and\nthe election will take place on\nNov. 7th. All ICwarians are\nurged to attend what could be a very entertaining general meeting.\nThe folk season in the upper\nrefectory began with a visit from\nthe Tinkers, the popular Irish folk\ngroup. The group has been together for a year and a half, and\nconsists of Maureen KennedyMartin from London, Gerry Fox\nfrom Tyrone who plays the fiddle,\nand Mick Flynn from Dublin,\nwho plays a variety of instruments including banjo, penny-whistle and tabor.\nTheir performance was thoroughly enjoyed by the audience,\nwho joined in all the choruses\nwith gusto. Their repertoire\nranged from a traditional Irish\ninstrumental which began the\nevening to \" pop \" music in the\nform of the Dubliners' hit \" A Black Velvet Band.\" Their song?\nwere highly amusing and included\na delightful song about a girl fr or p Barnstable written by Jeremy\nTailor of \" Wait a Minim' and\n\" Mrs. Wilson's Diary \" fame.\nThe Tinkers were ably supported by members of I.C. folk\nwho demonstrated that there is a great deal of talent in the folk\nworld right here in college.\nThroughout the evening the tremendous audience participation\nwas a clear reflection on the talent\nof the performers.\nFELIX CROSSWORD\nCLUES ACROSS\n1.
