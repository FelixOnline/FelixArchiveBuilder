    "content": "FELIX\nFriday 16 MARCH 2012\n22\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nComment Editors: Tim Arbabzadah\nSam Horti\nCOMMENT\nFELIX\nT\nhe Overseas Societies Committee is the arm of the Imperial College Union which\nboth looks after the interests\nof and manages all of the international societies present at Imperial.\nWith a current strength of 38 societies under our watch, the total membership that\ncomes under the OSC amounts to a staggering figure of 2126, making us one of\nthe largest Management Groups around.\nThe line-up of events for the OSC this\nyear witnessed the inauguration of the\nOSC World Summit and the International\nFestival entitled \u2018The Melting Pot\u2019, alongside our staple events which included the\nOSC Football World Cup and the International Night. Apart from Management\nGroup level activities, a large number of\nconstituent societies also very enthusiastically stage their own annual cultural performances to showcase their tradition and\nheritage in an emphatic style.\nIt may seem like a no-brainer to an outsider that the international scene at Imperial College London should be one that\nis flourishing and thriving in light of the\nhighly cosmopolitan make-up of the student community. However, the flowery\npicture I have painted in the first paragraph\nis simply a fa\u00e7ade which hides an unsettling truth behind it. In reality, the OSC is\nsuffering from a declining spiral which is\nthreatening its very existence. A deeper\nprobe into the situation uncovers several\nfundamental issues international societies\nare facing, as I shall depict below.\nFirst, Union policies have been structured to not support activities which involve food. Sadly, food is sometimes\none of the most effective ways of sharing\nvarious cultures and traditions with one\nanother and it is not surprising that the international societies are suffering beacuse\nof this.\nSecond, arguments which are usually\nput forward by other Management Group\nExecutives point to the fact that certain\ncultural shows are profit-generating,\nhence they should not receive financial\nsupport from the Union. Little do they\nrealise that they have gotten the order of\ncause and effect horrendously wrong. The\nprogressive cuts in the budget of the OSC\nhas driven societies to increase their ticket\nprices year after year, with the minimal\nprofit they generate channelled back to\nfinance events involving food (which they\nreceive absolutely no grants for) or donated generously to a charity in an attempt to\nbenefit the community around us. Moreover, we should also understand the main\nsource of this ticket income: it comes from\nthe very pockets of international students\nlike myself who attend several shows a\nyear in support of fellow international stu-dents, with the damage usually amounting\nto around \u00a350 by the end of Spring term.\nThird, on top of the worrying problem\nof a shortage of funding, international societies are further slapped with huge fees\nfor running cultural performances. The\ncost incurred amounts to \u00a32500 on aver-age, of which approximately \u00a32000 is attributed to lighting and sound equipment\nhire from Dramatic Society, and approximately \u00a3500 is attributed to the charge by\nthe Conferences & Events office for the\nGreat Hall hire. While the figure for Dramatic Society\u2019s services may seem like an\nexcessive amount, charging to hire an auditorium within the school which we pay\nfees to attend seems a rather ridiculous\npolicy in my opinion.\nWhat I have described is simply the tip\nof the iceberg. These persistent problems\nhave severely undermined the activities\nand events within the OSC. Even the inauguration of two new large-scale events\nin the form of the OSC World Summit\nand the International Festival failed to re-invigorate our quest to increase funding\nfor the OSC. The Management Group\ntook hefty cuts for the third consecutive\nyear, which saw us drop to a funding level of \u00a34186 for the upcoming academic\nyear. This figure reflects the largest percentage drop amongst all Management\nGroups and Faculty Unions, and the current amount stands at a worrying 60% of\nthe funding level back in 2009/10. With\nsome simple mathematics, each member\nwithin the OSC is given, on average, a\n\u00a31.97 grant for a full academic year. In\nmy opinion, these figures seem to have\nsome stark resemblance to poverty statistics quoted in many reports. Such is the\nsorry state of the support that the OSC\ncurrently receives.\nIn the past few weeks, this issue has\nbeen surfaced by several key leaders and\nelection candidates within the Union.\nComparisons have been made between\nthe \u00a34186 received by the OSC and the\napproximate amount of \u00a315000 received\nby a 60-member-strong Gliding club. It\nis heartening to know that there are student leaders who understand our con-cerns, and it is the hope of the international community that there will be more\namongst the student population who will\nlend their ears and appreciate our plight.\nThere are exemplary models around in\nother Universities to draw comparisons\nto. The One World Week at Warwick\nUniversity is an annual extravaganza\naimed at celebrating the diversity of the\nstudent population through forums, de-bates, discussions, parades, performances\nand a large host of sports and games. This\nevent is by no means an easy task for\nIC\u2019s international scene\nvolunteers to organize, but it is without\ndoubt impossible to put in place without ample support from the University.\nGlancing over to our close neighbours at\nKing\u2019s College London, international societies get their College theatre venue for\nperformances at negligible running costs,\nincluding light and sound equipment.\nInternational students who are aware of\nsuch discrepancies in funding within our\nCollege can only yearn for equal levels\nof support to those provided at other\nUniversities, and we are left to reflect on\nthe absence of the true international experience that Imperial had promisingly\nlooked to offer. It is the duty of not just\nthe student leaders, but all members of\nthe student community to stand up on this\nissue so as to curb the degradation of the\ninternational scene at Imperial.\nIt would be foolish to expect changes\nto happen overnight, but it is time for us\nto rally together to lift the international\nscene to the dizzying heights that it is\npotentially capable of reaching. More\nimportantly, my use of the word \u2018us\u2019 in\nthe previous sentence refers not just to\ninternational students but local students\nas well, for the benefits of improving the\ninternational scene will have far-reaching\npositive effects for the entire student\ncommunity. Local students will stand\nto gain from a more holistic experience\nof the plethora of cultures and traditions\nthat international students represent, right\nhere in their home country. Other concomitant positives include improvements\nin satisfaction surveys, advancement in\nUniversity rankings, and even possibly\nthe boosting of our reputation to become\none of the most prestigious institutions\nwhere the best minds from all over the\nUnited Kingdom and the world assemble\nto study, work, and play in a warm and\ninclusive cosmopolitan environment.\nIt is a dream of many of us that one\nday every student who walks through the\ngates of Imperial College London can say\nthat he or she has had a truly international\nexperience at this world-renowned estab-lishment. But it is only if everyone works\ntogether that this dream can be achieved.\nDo your part, and stand up for our cause!\nWant to show\nyor support\nfor the OSC\nfrom the comfort of your\nown home?\nHead over to\nfelixonline.\nco.uk to get\nyour voice\nheard.\nWenjun Er\nFelix, unlike many other student publi-cations, enjoys editorial independence.\nThis grants us the ability to criticise\nthe decisions of the Union and College\nwithout interference in the publication\nprocess. Other universities have, for\nexample, sabbatical positions in place\nwithin their unions, undertaking the\nrole of covering communications within\nthe union. This could cover all manners\nof media; television, radio, and indeed\nthe press. Felix, on the other hand,\ndoes not have a sabbatical officer enter the office just before the printing\ndeadline, looking to remove a quote\nthat doesn\u2019t tie in with the Union\u2019s own\nstance.\nLast week Felix ran a comment piece\nwhich called into question the editorial\nindependence of Felix. This article led a\nsignificant number of people to believe\nthat College had directly intervened in\nthe production process of Felix a week\nprior to this. I would like to take the\nopportunity to reassure readers that\nthe decision to run or not run articles\nremains solely an editorial decision,\nwith editorial independence remaining\nentirely strong. The reasoning in the\ncase detailed was the result of potentially serious inaccuracies, something\nthat I feel, as an Editor, should in turn\nbe taken with the utmost seriousness.\nIt is certainly right that we have the\nability to hold those who represent us\nto account when the evidence is entirely clear. Felix thrives on responsible\njournalism and investigations, bringing\nlight to the student body relevant and\npertinent behind-the-scenes. The comment section, while promoting opinion\nand debate, should in no way court libel or defamation when it could threaten the responsibility invested in Felix\nby its editorial independence.\nOnce again, I apologise for any concern caused with regards to the relationship that we hold with both the Union and College. Investigative reporting\nmust be encouraged, but what is being\nreported must be scrutinised before\nwe can make anything from grandiose\nclaims to the smallest of statements\nto the most heated t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate with the\nUnion. Even when under the banner of\nopinion, we cannot allow claims against\ninstitutions to go unchecked. Perhaps\nfuture successors will disagree, but\ndiving in to expose a story without, for\nexample, having the hard evidence to\nback it up, is not the way that it works.\nIndependence Days and\nFelix\nDoes the international scene need to reach\nexplosive new heights?\n\n"

    "content": "I\u2019m sat on a couch at The Beans Group head\noffice, waiting to interview its founder,\nJames Eder. I\u2019ve been there only a matter\nof seconds and I\u2019m already finding myself\nforced to adjust my expectations. The mental images evoked by the word \u2018office\u2019 certainly weren\u2019t matching the scenes before\nmy eyes. As Heart FM gently filled the room\n(that I later discovered to be referred to as\nthe Beanstalk) employees scoured computer\nscreens, tapped furiously or, as a few were\ndoing, discussed what I could only deduce to\nbe this week\u2019s EastEnders. I can\u2019t purport to\nbe a regular when it comes to \u2018office tours\u2019,\nbut this was certainly not what I envisaged.\nThe Beans Group is best known for stu-dentbeans.com, the brainchild of the 29 year\nold James Eder. A business that actually\nsprung out a final year project during his time\nstudying at Birmingham University, James,\nalong with his brother, put their savings on\nthe line and set off to made a success of it.\nSeven years on, studentsbeans.com is now\na nationally recognized brand that receives\n700,000 visitors to its website a month,\na fact that swells Eder with pride. \u201cI can\u2019t\nwrite songs, I can\u2019t sing,\u201d he admits, \u201cbut\nif you\u2019re walking down the street and you\nhear someone singing a song you\u2019ve written,\nhow awesome a feeling is that? We\u2019ve created something that has made a difference,\nthat last month just got over 700,000 visitors\ncoming through to the site, and if you removed it from the world, in theory 700,000\npeople would notice it disappear. It\u2019s really\nthis excitement that keeps me personally go-ing, and similarly for the team.\u201d\nThe thought of building a customer base\nof 700,000 in seven years would make any\nbudding entrepreneur baulk but Eder downplays his successes as he explains to me the\ncompany\u2019s 25 year vision. Better known as\nthe BHAG (pronounced bee-hag) \u2013 the Big\nHairy Audacious Goal \u2013 is for The Beans\nGroup to touch 100 million people everyday,\na target that James feels keeps the company\nprogressing in the right direction. He draws\non the example of NASA engineers who, in\ngetting a man on the moon, worked purposefully to achieve something that excited and\ninspired them. This in turn trickles down and\ndefines the working environment as one in\nwhich work is done with real enthusiasm\nand enjoyment, two characteristics that are\nboth seen in the atmosphere at The Beans\nGroup.\nClearly well read in the business of busi-ness, Eder backs up his experience of start-ups with the words of Vue Cinemas founder\nTim Richard: \u201cit\u2019s a combination of luck,\nwind and timing. You need to be in the certain place, but the wind needs to be blowing\nin the certain direction, and also at the right\ntime. It\u2019s not about luck, but when fortune\nmeets opportunity, things come together\u201d.\nEder certainly seems to know about fortune meeting opportunity. He recounts to\nme the occasion when internally they decided to contact Acorn, the company that\npowers Virgin Experience Days (similar to\nRed Letter Days), with a view to opening up\na working relationship. Minutes later, having left the office, he\u2019s standing on platform\nat Golders Green, the location of the Bean\nGroup office, that James is the first to admit\nis not the centre of the world. Waiting for\nthe tube, he gets chatting to the person next\nto him. Asking what he does for a living, the\nstranger turns and replies \u201cYou know Virgin\nExperience Days? We\u2019re the company who\norganize those\u2026\u201d All this, as James points\nout, within the space of ten minutes. \u201cYou\ncouldn\u2019t make that up, I feel like I\u2019m in The\nTruman Show sometimes.\u201d\nWhilst that story seems purely down to\nchance, you get the sense that James is the\nkind of guy who makes his own luck. He\ntells me about the dark early days of stu-dentsbeans when, for the first four years,\nworking 18 hour days was not unusual. In\nthe face of abuse from shop owners in Sheffield or intimidation from competitors on\nFELIX\nFriday 16 MARCH 2012\n20\nbusiness.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nBusiness & Finance Editors: Will Prince\nDeepka Rana\nBUSINESS & FINANCE\nIn brief\nFelix Business recommends...\nSix books to fill those poolside,\nEaster holiday moments\nSpilling all the beans\nthe streets of Birmingham, James has repeatedly picked up his head and powered on.\nIn fairness, as admirable as James\u2019 example of persistence and application is, it\u2019s\nnothing unconventional. In every sphere of\nlife, hard work, generally, results in reward.\nHowever, James has clearly meditated long\non the science of business and his seven\nyears being his own boss have given him an\nimpressive ability to view business in a very\nstripped down form. When I finally ask him\nfor some advice for budding entrepreneurs,\nhis answer is far from conventional.\n\u201cCould you imagine if everyone goes out\nand randomly speaks to one new person every day? Just something random and stupid\nand small, that gets people talking. People\ndo business with people. Who in your network who you\u2019re close to but have never\nmet yet could be that person who could help\nyou in the future? Whether its getting a job\nor being business partners, you just never\nknow. And that\u2019s the point of the story about\nthe platform in Golders Green.\u201d\nThe point is simple, it\u2019s more of a lesson\nin life than in business, but at its core sits\nsomething that\u2019s key for anyone who wants\nto get on in the world of work. Moreover, it\nstrikes me as something that would be particularly potent at Imperial, given our vast\nresources of intellectual capital and apparent lack of any sense of community. If only\nthe candidates in the presidential election\nheld such simple yet progressive ideas, we\nmight yet see some real change for the bet-ter.\nWill Prince\n\u201cYou get the sense that\nJames is the kind of guy\nwho makes his own luck\u201d\nWe speak to studentbeans.com founder James Eder, who takes\nthe time out to teach us a short lesson in business.\nFull of beans \u2013 James Eder\nThe Naked Leader \u2013\nDavid Taylor: Hailed to\ncontain the formula for\nguaranteed success,\nstraight from the celebrated lifestyle guru\nhimself.\nToo Big To Fail\n\u2013 Andrew Ross Sorkin:\nScene-by-scene narrative of what brought\nabout the financial crisis and its key players.\nThe Moral\nSense \u2013 James Q.

Niven introduces us into his world as God returns from his one week vacation \u2013 a\nweek in Heaven corresponding to several hundred years on Earth. God, who\nleft for his vacation at around the time of\nthe Renaissance, returns to find his lovingly created planet scarred by \u201cAuschwitz, Buchenwald, Belsen, Guantanamo, Belfast, Cambodia, Vietnam,\nFlanders, Ypres, Nagasaki, Hiroshima,\nRwanda, Bosnia\u2026\u2026ethnic cleansing,\ncapitalism, communism...nuclear deterrence and mutually assured destruction\u2026Fatwa and Jihad\u2026.gays being\nhanged\u2026the Taliban\u2026the burqa and\nthe hijab\u2026Kim Kardashian\u2026deforestisation, globalisation, collateral dam-age, brand awareness, marketing, product placement and Republicans\u201d.\nHowever, this is no \u2018normal\u2019 God.\nAs Niven gleefully tells us, this is a\nGod that \u201cloves fags\u201d, \u201cloves spades\u201d\nand has his \u201cshirt sleeves rolled up\u201d\nto tackle the big problems of our age\n(like a celestial David Cameron). This\nis a God that conference calls his fellow religious entities (complete with\na potty mouthed Muhammad) and has\ndinner with Satan \u2013 the two have a\nfriendly competition going about who\ncan get the most admittances into their\nrespective domains, and a God that accidentally starts the big bang because of\na casual \u201cmorning toke\u201d gone awry. So\nfar, so deliberately controversial.\nNiven does not stop there. When God\nis meeting Satan for dinner, we are\ngreeted with a parade of celebrity and\npolitical hate figures meeting numerous grisly ends: you have Reagan crapping himself to death and the recently\ndeceased Jesse Helms. Helms was, before his death, a five term Republican\nsenator for North Carolina, who was\nfamous for opposing civil rights, disability rights, any bill that he suspected\nof hiding vaguely feminist tendencies,\ngay rights (he once famously called\none of his many political opponents a\n\u201cmilitant-activist-mean lesbian\u201d), affirmative action, contemporary art that he\nconsidered to be sexually inappropriate,\nand (of course) abortion.

In a bid to spread his new commandment of \u201cBe Nice\u201d to the masses,\nJesus enters American Popstar \u2013 a\nreality show that searches for the next\nbig thing. And of course it is headed by\nSteven Stelfox, Niven\u2019s deliberately\nunsubtle recreation of Simon Cowell.\nIt is within these segments of the\nnovel \u2013 the ones that deal directly\nwith the music industry \u2013 that gives\nthe novel its only redeeming feature.\nIt is hard not to be swept along with\nthe genuine enthusiasm the author has\nfor the concept of Jesus playing \u2018Born\nto Run\u2019 on the final of American Popstar. However, for some reason, Niven\nsuffocates these moments of agile and\nauthentic humour with clunking pieces\nof synthesised angst about just about\neverything. And this is what proves\nterminal for the novel.\nAs you may have noticed from the\nabove extracts, this is a book that\ndoggedly chases controversy. Henry\nSutton, a journalist for the Daily Mirror, said that \u201conly the truly ignorant\nwill take offence\u201d to Niven\u2019s novel. I\nwould agree with that statement \u2013 this\nbook is not offensive. However, the\nbook is incorrect. Not politically incorrect but just completely incorrect.\nNiven aims his tirade of artificial\nmoral disdain at almost every aspect\nof organised religion. He does not\nconsider the fact that the characters\nhe chooses to represent organised religion are realistic. For example, the\nPastor in the novel is an obviously\nhomophobic, racist, misogynistic and\nsexually repressed individual. Not\nonce does Niven reflect the debate that\nis present inside the church regarding\ntopics such as gay marriage; instead,\nhe decides to depict the argument using only primary colours. He takes a\nshot at the celebrity culture we live in,\nyet does not decide to dissect the anatomy of such a culture. Niven also criticises the burqa \u2013 but again chooses to\nignore the existence of the many wom-No humans were harmed in the writing of this review\nI have somewhat of a fondness for\namusing lists. They\u2019re a quick read\nand perfect whether you want to you\nwant to wind down or just procras-tinate. I was therefore interested to\nhear of Tastes like Human, the latest\nbook by \u2018The Shark Guys\u2019 \u2013 Noel\nBoivin and Christopher Lombardo.\nHaving written for websites like\nCracked and The Huffington Post\nthe pair are no strangers to the format and show themselves to be more\nthan competent.

Tastes Like Human\nis good for a collection of humorous\nbooks but, as you might expect from\na book of this type, it certainly isn\u2019t\nanything life changing. That\u2019s not\na criticism and I would still recommend that you check it out. At 115\npages it is somewhat short but this\nmeans you don\u2019t tire of it and that\nit can easily be finished by even the\nbusiest student or slowest reader. At\nless than \u00a32 for the ebook it\u2019s certainly at least good value for money.\nA look at Tastes like Human: the latest book of humorous lists by \u2018The Shark Guys\u2019\nen who choose to wear the burqa for\ntheir own personal reasons. In doing\nso, Niven ignores the inherent beauty\nof that decision \u2013 the kind of decision\nthat even the God Niven depicts would\nagree with and thus misses the point\nquite spectacularly. Thus, he portrays\nall of his arguments in exceptionally\nsimplistic, Tabloid-esque headlines\nwith the intention to shock, polarise\nand, childishly enough, probably to of-fend. And it is this that proves to be the\nworst part of a pretty distasteful book.\nHow can Niven credibly criticise organised religion, republicans etc. etc.\nof making over simplistic, illogi-cal, unrepresentative and essentially\nbigoted arguments when he himself\nmakes over simplistic, illogical, unrepresentative and essentially bigoted\narguments? To put it another way, I\nam not criticising Niven for pointing\nout the plank of wood in his brother\u2019s\neye when he has dirt in his own \u2013 I am\ncriticising the fact that they\u2019re brothers\nin the first place.\nOr to put it in a way Niven may un-derstand, only buy this book if you\nwant to fork out \u00a37.99 for a roll of toilet paper with only 376 sheets.\nMaciej Matuszewski\n\u201cirreverent and outrageous [...] and always funny\u201d\n\n"

    "content": "SCIENCE\nFELIX Friday 16 March 2012 15\nLast great ape genome sequenced\nA decade after the completion of the human genome sequence, researchers have\nsequenced the genome of a female western lowland gorilla called Kamilah from\nSan Diego zoo. This means we now have\na fully sequenced, representative genome\nsequence from each of the four great ape\ngroups: humans, chimps and bonobos,\norangutans, and gorillas. Having the full\nset will enable scientists to better understand when each of these groups evolved\n\u2013 a current matter of debate.\nHumans are identical to our ape relatives in almost all of our DNA base-pairs. We differ by 1.37% from the\nchimp, 1.75% from the gorilla and 3.4%\nfrom the orang-utan. Molecular data\nsuggests humans and their closest rela-tives, chimps, diverged about 4.5 million\nyears ago while evidence from fossils\nsuggests they diverged as far back as 7\nmillion years ago. Having completed the\nsequencing of the great ape genomes,\nresearchers at the Sanger Institute in\nCambridge now suggest that humans\nand chimps split around 6 million years\nago. Additionally, they believe gorillas\ndiverged from the human-chimp line approximately 10 million years ago, a finding consistent with previous estimates.\nThe researchers also confirmed that humans are most closely related to chimps\nbut, in fact, 15% of the human genome\nmore closely matches the gorilla\u2019s.\nDr Richard Durbin, senior author of\nthe study from the Sanger Institute, said,\n\u201cAfter decades of debate, our genetic\ninterpretations are now consistent with\nthe fossil record and provide a way for\npalaeontologists and geneticists to work\nwithin the same framework. Our data\nare the last genetic piece we can gather\nfor this puzzle: there are no other living\ngreat ape genera to study.\u201d\nAnother significant finding was that\ngorillas share many parallel genetic\nchanges with humans including the evolution of hearing. Previously it has been\nshown that a gene involved in hearing,\ncalled LOXHD1, had evolved rapidly in\nhumans compared to the same gene in\nchimpanzees and this was thought to be\nrelated the development of language in\nhumans. However, the sequencing of the\ngorilla genome has shown that this gene\nhas evolved in gorillas at a similar rate to\nthat in humans, casting doubt on the connection between the gene and language.\nAs well as sequencing the genome of\nKamilah, the researchers also partially\nsequenced the genome of three other\ngorillas including an eastern lowland\ngorilla, a rare species estimated at only\n20,000 individuals. They compared the\ngenomes of eastern and western lowland gorillas and concluded that the species diverged around 0.5 million years\nago but continued to interbreed a small\namount after that. Researchers have\npreviously suggested that the shrinking\npopulation and low genetic diversity of\neastern lowland gorillas is due to recent\nhuman activity.\nHowever, the new analysis suggests\nthat this problem is much older.\nAnother reason for studying animals is\nto help decipher the functions of genes\nin the human genome. The researchers\nat the Sanger Institute have identified\na mutated version of a gene that, while\nstrongly associated with dementia in\nhumans, is present in all the gorilla genomes they sequenced. Therefore, it is\ninteresting how gorillas can survive with\nthis mutation when it causes such problems in humans.\nToday, gorillas survive in just a few\nisolated and endangered populations in\ncentral Africa. As well as informing us\nabout human evolution, this latest research also emphasises the importance\nof protecting the full diversity of these\nspecies and may aid conservation efforts.\nHarry Marshall, a primate researcher at\nthe Zoological Society of London, said,\n\u201cPeople can start to take the genome and\ntry to look for bits of it that might be\nlinked to animals\u2019 fitness.\u201d\nDOI: 10.1038/nature10842\nKamilah the gorilla\nPeek-a-boo, I see you! Our eyes are\namazing machines, capable of capturing all of the light coming into them for\nthe brain to process, as well as adapting\nto variations of distance, hue and inten-sity. And it\u2019s not only humans that are\ngifted with this. Almost all animals use\neyes as their primary method of sensing\ntheir environment, be it with two eyes,\nfour or eight.\nNow, new research has been presented which shows that a species of polyp,\nHydra magnipapillata, uses specialised\ncells which respond to light in the absence of eyes. Published in the journal\nBioMed Central (BMC) Biology, the report outlines that stinging cells (cnido-cytes) in the polyp\u2019s tentacles are controlled through a nervous system which\nuses light as a stimulus. The light triggers a defence mechanism of poisonous\nbarbs on the tentacles against potential\npredators and or to catch unwary prey.\nThe research was conducted by a\nteam led by Dr. David Plachetzki from\nthe University of California. They further discovered that opsin \u2013 a light sensitive protein found in sensory cells \u2013 is\nresponsible for regulating the action of\nthe protective cnidocytes. This is linked\nto a simple nervous system with light\nsensitive neurons to act as a relay, in a\nsimilar fashion to many other sensory\norgans.\nPlachetzki described that other pho-totransduction proteins are also present\nin their sensory cells. \u201cNot only did we\nfind opsin in the sensory neurons that\nconnect to cnidocytes in the hydra, but\nwe also found other components of\nphototransduction in these cells. These\nincluded cyclic nucleotide gated ion\nchannels (CNG) required to transfer\nthe signal and a hydra version of arres-tin, which wipes the phototransduction\nslate clean for a second signal.\n\u201cWe were also able to demonstrate\nthat cnidocyte firing itself is effected\nby the light environment and that these\neffects are reversed when components\nof the phototransduction cascade are\nturned off,\u201d he said. Though cnidarians\nhave been around for over 600 million\nyears in various animals\u2019 systems, the\nHydra\u2019s approach to using light is along\na similar pathway to other animals\u2019\ndevelopment \u2013 sensing more of your\nenvironment can only be an added advantage to help catch your prey, while\navoiding being someone else\u2019s. The\nsimilarities shared with human evolution also hints at a common ancestor\ngoing back millions of years.\nDOI: 10.1186/1741-7007-10-17\nNo eyedea\nPavitar Devgon\nLast week, just days before the anniversary of the Fukushima disaster, came\nevidence that radioactive plutonium has\nspread much further from the nuclear\nplant than previously thought. Scientists\nfrom the National Institute of Radiological Sciences in Japan, found traces of\nthe potentially harmful substance over\n20 kilometres away from the plant \u2013\nthankfully though, they say this poses no\nhealth risk.\nThe crisis, which left 27,000 people\ndead or missing and caused billions of\ndollars in damage, began on 11 March\n2011.Amagnitude 9.0 earthquake on the\nPacific floor triggered a tsunami which\nimpacted, and subsequently devastated,\nthe northeast coastline of Japan. Moments after the initial quake, the three\noperating reactors at Fukushima Daiichi\nautomatically shut down. However, 41\nminutes later the tsunami burst through\nthe plant\u2019s defences, flooding the reac-tors. Over the following days, emergency systems failed and the reactors melted\ndown. Hydrogen gas was released, triggering explosions in the reactor buildings which allowed volatile radioactive\nchemicals to escape into the air and sea.\nUnlike other radioactive contaminants\nto come from Fukushima, plutonium is\ndifferent. It is not volatile so it is harder\nfor it to escape from a nuclear reactor during a meltdown. But it is thought, in the\ncase of Fukushima, the force of the hydrogen explosions propelled out some plutonium in the form of particulate matter.\nPlutonium can be extremely harmful.\nWhen it decays, it releases heavy particles\nsuch as electrons and helium nuclei \u2013 not\nparticularly dangerous outside the body,\nbut if ingested can cause genetic damage.\nThe team analysed soil samples for\ndifferent plutonium isotopes produced\nduring the course of the power plants\u2019\nnuclear reactions. And for the first time,\ndetected traces of plutonium-241, which\nhas a half-life of about 14 years.\nThe additional plutonium exposure\nfrom inhaling this loose plutonium is\nfive times higher than the government\u2019s\ncurrent estimate for exposure from the\naccident. But the health risk is less scary\nthan you might assume, as the average\nperson on Earth receives much greater\nexposure over a 50 year period from\nnatural sources of radiation.\nLead author of the study Jian Zheng\nestimates that the total amount of pluto-nium-241 released from Fukushima was\nabout 10,000 times less than that from\nthe 1986 Chernobyl accident in Ukraine\n\u2013 making these recent findings particularly interesting. The distances at which\nthe plutonium was found suggest that it\nwas ejected during the hydrogen explosions in the first days of the crisis yet the\nrelatively low levels indicate that the\nheavily shielded concrete casings around\nthe reactors did offer protection from the\nworst of the fallout.\nIndependent work such as this is particularly important because, as reported\nin Nature last week, mistrust in the government in running high among Japanese residents. And although clean-up of\nthe immediate site could take four or five\ndecades, studies like this are key for providing residents and evacuees with the\ninformation they need to get their lives\nback to normal.\nDOI: 10.1038/srep00304\nPlutonium found far from Fukushima\nEmma Houghton-Brown\nSophia David\nWant to write for\nFelix Science?\nEmail us.\nSampling sites around the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant (DNPP)\nNature\n\u201c\n\u201d\nOur data are the\nlast genetic piece\nwe can gather for\nthis puzzle\n\n"

It\u2019s hardly an achievement to beat most other universities anyway \u2013 they have\npeople on Arts degrees, and\nthat lot still use Comic Sans\nfor everything.\nThis week you don\u2019t care\nabout elections.

It\u2019s doing\nmy head in.\nelectionscopes-stilllessspamthaninyouremailbox\nMichael Hunt reports on how the Onions\u2019 most successful elections ever failed to reach the ambitious goals set\nThe last week has seen\nthe Onion\u2019s latest attempt at reaching the\nnumber one spot in\nstudent union election\nturnout. Last year\u2019s first\nplace (based on the\npercentage of voters to\nelectoral role) went to\nExeter University. With\na staggering 38.3%\nturnout, Exeter was assumed to be the obvious target to beat in\n2012. However \u201cbig\u201d\nplans from Imperial College Onion\u2019s think tank\nset the optimistic goal of\nachieving a 120% turnout in this years Sabbatical elections. While\nsome criticised such a\ngoal has \u201coptimistic\u201d or\n\u201cmathematically incorrect\u201d, the Onion (with its\nteam of hardened mon-keys) set about to do\nthe impossible. However, the inevitable failure\nof reaching such a target has come as no surprise to some individu-als, despite a plethora\nof gimmicks and stunts\nto boost figures.\nThroughout the five\nday voting period the\nOnion went to extremes\nto attain a respectable\n(but not quite wanted)\nfigure, topping the election league tables na-tionally. The first and\nmost obvious ploy was\nto bring back a live\nstats page which, after\nlast year\u2019s popularity,\nproved to be a huge\nsuccess. Paraded by\nthe official mascots (The\nLittle Guys), this year\u2019s\nstats went to show that\nthe sheer arrogance of\nImperial students would\nnot let them be bested\nby \u201clesser\u201d universi-ties. With an average\nof 40,000 users on the\nstats page at any one\ntime, Hangman fully\nexpects this tactic to\nreplicate itself for many\nyears to come.\nHowever, in a particularly controversial move,\nthe Faculty Union elections were merged into\nthe same period and\nsystem as those used\nfor the Sabbatical elec-tions. Due to the nature\nof every student officer\nposition being elected\nat the same time, students were continually\nspamed with emails,\nflyers and lecture shout\nouts to go and vote.\nWhilst most students\nwere annoyed with the\ncontinual bombardment\nof election propaganda,\nsome individuals welcomed the infinitely\nincreased attention.\nSome have speculated\nthat such a system will\nleave other (still impor-tant) positions open to\ninadequate candidates\nwhere an unsuccessful\nsabbatical candidate\nwould normally stand.\nIn what is considered\nto be the most shocking\nexploitation of \u201cFreebie\u201d\ntheory, the Onion decided to heavily invest in a\nfree iPad 2 for everyone\nwho voted. The saving\ngrace of this was that\nthe tablets were bought\nin bulk just before the\nrelease of the iPad 3,\ncosting the Onion marginally less. With such\nan incentive irresistible\nto the majority of under-graduates, the costly\ninitiative succeeded\nin rapidly raising the\nturnout of voters. However the public wish to\nmeasure the outcome\nof the event, it can not\nbe denied that this was\nthe best year for student\ndemocracy according\nto someone \u2018s definition.\nOutside the Onion\u2019s\ncontrol, Imperial Memes\n(a Facebook page with\nover 4,000 fans) is\nthought to have heavily\ninfluenced the outcome\nof the elections with\nsuggestive posts about\ncertain candidates.\nAll votes are likely to\nbe cancelled and rendered void henceforth,\nwith Imperial joining\nthe heady ranks of UK\nuniversities questioned\nover election reliability.\nFriday 16 march 2012\n\n"

    "content": "COMMENT\nFELIX Friday 16 MARCH 2012 23\nCOMMENT\nFELIX\nT\nhis May, Londoners will\nagain be called upon to\nelect a mayor, and if the\npolls are anything to go by\nthe race between incumbent Boris Johnson and returning rival\nKen Livingstone is too close to call.\nThe thing is, I have real difficulty understanding how that can be so. Cynics\nremark that British politics is increasingly being reduced to a personality\ncontest and, worryingly, it seems to me\nthat the 2012 mayoral election has a\ncandidate basing their entire campaign\non a persona.\nBecause, simply put, if we look over\nthese four years of Johnson we see that\neven his claimed successes, such as the\ncouncil tax freeze and the \u201cNew Bus\nFor London\u201d, don\u2019t hold up to close\nscrutiny.\nSeeing as it is now plastered around\nthe city as part of Boris\u2019s \u201c9 point plan\nfor a Greater London\u201d, the freeze of\ncouncil tax bills in the \u201cMayor\u2019s Precept\u201d portion of London is the perfect\nexample. The Back Boris campaign\nproudly claim that this freeze saved\nfamilies \u00a3445, and while it\u2019s true that\nthe precept did rise under Livingstone,\nthis figure is entirely imaginary. Rather\nbeing derived from promised bud-gets, this figure comes from projected\nincreases based on the average precept rise under Livingstone. Not only\nthat, this ignores the fact that Boris\u2019s\nfreeze was funded substantially by a\ncentral government grant, for which\nKen would also have been eligible.\nOf course, Johnson has also gone one\nstep further, pledging to cut the precept\nif he\u2019s re-elected. The slight issue is\nBack Boris? Not bloody likely!\nthat his cuts only amount to a generous\naverage saving of \u00a37 a year per house-hold.\nOf course, as students, council tax\nchanges aren\u2019t entirely our concern.\nTransport however, the area where the\nmayor has the most direct control, most\ncertainly is, and the record here is similarly patchy. Under Boris ticket prices\nhave soared, seeing the cost of a single\nbus journey rise by 50% to \u00a31.35, and a\nweekly zone 1-2 travelcard by 20% to\n\u00a329.20. But while Boris is happy to try\nand claim network investment begun\nunder Livingstone for himself, it seems\na fair portion of this money is propping\nup pet projects with spiralling costs.\nWhile fares make a dent in our pock-ets, TfL has spent \u00a311m developing\njust 8 of the \u201cNew Buses For London\u201d,\nwhich is a stark contrast to the \u00a3300k\nit costs to purchase an existing hybrid model. The Barclay\u2019s Cycle Hire\nscheme, originally meant to be delivered at no cost to the tax payer, now has\n80% of its current \u00a3140m bill footed\nby TfL and the London Boroughs. In\na strikingly similar story, the planned\nThames Cable Car, also promised to be\ndelivered through private investment,\nnow has nearly half its \u00a360m bill being\nmet by TfL, with no clear indication of\nhow its predicted \u00a33m annual running\ncosts will be met.\nOf course, it\u2019s also possible that fare\nincreases have come about as a way to\nreplenish revenue lost from scrapping\nthe Congestion Charge Western Extension. And while Boris is making some\neffort to recoup the economic effects of\nits abolition, the same cannot be said\nfor the environmental impacts.\nUp to 4,000 deaths a year in the capital can be attributed to air pollution, and\nLondon is looking at swingeing fines of\n\u00a3300m from both the EU and the International Olympic Committee. But\nBoris has seemingly refused to treat\nthe issue seriously, at one point trying\nto claim high levels of particulates in\nCentral London were due to pollution\nbeing carried over form the continent.\nAny money he has committed to the\nissue has been spent predominately\non Dust Suppressants, which a TfL\nstudy states \u201cwill not be a useful [...]\ntechnique for preventing exceedances\nof the PM10 EU limit value\u201d, and pot\nplants, rather than actually addressing\nthe causes of pollution.\nAll of these points above fit in to a\nwider image of an entirely disconnected City Hall. A place where Tory London Assembly members believe \u201crelatively few Londoners use [\u2026] transport\nin any way\u201d. Where the number of\nstaff paid over \u00a3100k has doubled, the\nmayor receives a larger salary than the\nPrime Minister and marketing advisers\nare paid through private companies to\nevade tax. It\u2019s a City Hall accused of\n\u201cbarefaced lying\u201d about Police cuts,\nand that boasts of cutting waste while\nmaxing out public borrowing.\nOf course, who you vote for on May\n3rd remains entirely your choice. However, I implore you to reflect carefully\non the following question when making your decision: What precedent does\nit set for our Democracy if we allow a\nman to drift towards a second term simply because he\u2019s \u2018funny\u2019?\n...the 2012\nmayoral election\nhas a candidate\nbasing their entire\ncampaign on a\npersona.\n\u201c\n...the 20\n...the 2\nmayora\nmayora\n\u201d\nn a\nn a\nPadraic Calpin\nO\nn the Wednesday before\nelections opened, members of the Union had\ntheir questions answered\nlive on STOIC by candidates for the ICU Sabbatical Positions,\nas well as the faculty union presidents\nand the student trustees. This is a fantastic idea \u2013 if the candidates want our\nvote, they should be prepared to answer\nour questions and be subject to our\nscrutiny.\nIf only that\u2019s how it worked. The programme itself was excellent, very well\nput together with some brilliant commentary by the people in the \u2018Felix Studio\u2019. However, the format of the programme could do with improvement, as\nit came across as simply a platform for\nthe candidates to say \u2018Hi\u2019 \u2013 not that this\nis bad, in fact, it\u2019s important that we all\nget to know them.\nAs it so happened, one of my questions came up for the Felix Editor can-didates. To my disappointment, in a\nquestion where I asked for details on\nhow the potential editors would change\nthe journalistic output of Felix, the\nthree of them proceeded to answer the\ncomplete opposite: how they would improve the satirical output. Needless to\nsay, I was annoyed, and so proceeded\nto question them on Twitter (and then\nchallenge them on their replies).\nCandidates need to be scrutinised\non their policies: they can promise no\nend of wonderful things, but if people\ndon\u2019t actually challenge them to see if\nthe policies are realistic, or that they\nhave been properly thought through,\nthen there is a risk that a bad candidate\nis elected. Who isn\u2019t won over by tales\nof wonder and awe (and free sweets)?\nWhilst this allows the electoral body\nto challenge the candidates \u2013 grilling\nthem as they deserve, there are other\nbenefits also: candidates can fight\namongst themselves. Whilst this could\nlead to petty fighting and generally disgusting tactics, we can hope that Imperial students are above this, and can\nengage in an open and honest debate.\nThis not only teaches us more about the\ncandidates\u2019 policies (and how practical they are), but also gives us a honest\nidea as to what the candidate is like as a\nperson, away from the superficial image\ngiven off by campaigning.\nWe saw this in 2010 with the General Election \u2013 the three party leaders\nwere put head to head in a (strangely\nentertaining) debate. It may not have\nchanged many people\u2019s vote (bar a\nsomewhat temporary boost in support for the Liberal Democrats), but it\ngave the public a chance to make their\nmark. The only thing I would change\nis to allow the audience to fight back\nat the candidates \u2013 make them prove\nthemselves to the electorate. Just less \u201cI\nagree with Nick\u201d!\nI have support in this, @Esoteric-Gamer and @ICUChris both called for\na proper debate \u2013 this should send a\nmessage. It may be too late for this year,\nbut that does not mean that next year\u2019s\ncandidates can\u2019t be subject to the interrogation they deserve. Let us scrutinise\nthem in public for everyone to see, and\nin return ICU gets the best set of sabbatical officers that they could possibly\nhave. In the meantime, back to Twitter.\nReminder: If you\u2019re reading this on Friday, and you have not yet voted \u2013 remember to have your say! Voting closes\nat 23:59 at www.imperialcollegeunion.\norg/elections.\nPhilip Kent\nWhere was the debate?\nJust a persona? Boris in action\n\n"

Sadly Jack was injured for his ef-forts, so Freddy White was introduced\nto the action. As the half progressed, St\nMary\u2019s started to come more and more\ninto the game.

    "content": "FILM\nFELIX Friday 16 MARCH 2012 35\nAll hail the crime-fighting Hobo\nSome films are bad. Some films are so\nbad they\u2019re good. And there are some\nfilms which are so bad, they\u2019re awe-some.\nThe plot is neatly summarised in\nthe title. The Hobo (played by Rutger\nHauer of all people!) arrives at a town\nblack with crime and corruption. He\ndecides to take a stand and starts cleaning up the streets \u2013 with a shotgun, nat-urally. This attracts the attention of The\nDrake, the particularly vile crime-boss\nof the town, who calls for the Hobo\u2019s\nhead on a platter.\nThis film was originally a spoof trailer for Planet Terror and Death Proof\n(a collective homage to grindhouse by\nRobert Rodrigeuz and Quentin Tarantino respectively) but was lucky enough\n(and so were we) to be made into a fea-Rhys Davies\nDirector Jason Elsener\nScreenwriters Rob Cotterill,\nNiv Fichman, Paul Gross, Frank\nSiracusa\nCast Rutger Hauer\nHobo with a Shotgun\nture film. Other entries which were not\nso lucky include: Werewolf Women of\nthe SS, Don\u2019t, and Thanksgiving.\nCinematically, the film looks like it\nwas made in the 70s for that authentic\nexploitation feel. The writing and the\nacting are equally hammy. You get the\nfeeling that someone was sitting over\ntheir typewriter, thinking, \u201cOh yeah,\nthis is going to be really deep and\nmeaningful.\u201d That earnestness transforms the tragedy (in any other film)\ninto comedy.\nLikewise, the violence and gore in\nthis film is so over-the-top, it is beyond\nridiculous, fitting for something associated with Tarantino and Rodriguez. It\u2019s\nthe kind of violence that your 16-year-old self would get a real thrill out of; it\nprovoked howls of immature laughter\nfrom the sofa when I watched it with\nmy housemates.\nSo far, I\u2019ve only explained how it\u2019s\nbad. And it is bad, believe me, but it\nis also so very awesome. This comes\nfrom two main factors, I believe. First,\nthe enthusiasm of those involved. It is\nclear that no one in the cast is trying\nto bag an Oscar with this film. Instead,\nthey are free to enjoy themselves and\nmake a fun film. That is part of what\nmakes this so refreshing to watch.\nThe other element that sublimes this\nfilm into gold is Rutger Hauer. Unrecognisable as Roy Batty from Blade\nRunner or the \u2018Man with the beer\u2019 (A\nseries of ads by Guinness, as, in a black\ncoat, Hauer looks like a Guinness),\nHauer conveys a great deal of complexity in the character of the Hobo. At the\nstart of the film, we see the Hobo pushing a trolley around, rooting around in\nrubbish bins for food and cigarettes.\nHe begs and degrades himself in order\nto get enough money for the one thing\nhe wants more than anything else (not\na shotgun but I won\u2019t spoil it). Not particularly easy to watch. But when he\nconverses with another character, he\nflits between simple human desires and\npossibly mad ramblings. Even though\nhe is the sole protagonist, it is hard to\nbe sure where he is coming from. In the\nentire film, he is the only character elevated from a 2D cut-out, thanks largely\nto Hauer\u2019s engaging portrayal.\nHe also blows away a paedophilic\nSanta Claus. Did I mention that?\nOn the back of Oscar season, there\nare plenty of deep and artistic films to\nwatch. Also, summer is coming, bringing with it the usual clutch of block-busters. This is neither. If you want to\nwatch either of those, you know where\nto go. If instead you want largely mindless violence to the point of hilarity,\nI advise you check out Hobo With A\nShotgun from your local Blockbuster.\nBoris Johnson is getting serious about winning his London Mayor campaign\nGlenn Close is a Nobbs\nNo, this is not a story about an Irish\nlesbian. Sure, Albert Nobbs (Close) is\nactually a woman posing as a man in\n19th Century Ireland, and the slightly\nmisleading trailer might make you\nthink that Albert is sexually interested\nin women. However, Albert Nobbs is\na story that has very little to do with\nsex. Instead, it\u2019s about companionship,\nloneliness and survival during tough,\nconservative times where social and\ngender divisions prevented females\nfrom the working class being taken at\nall seriously. The decision to dress like\na bloke was really the only method that\nNobbs could think of, at the young age\nof 14, and she has kept up with this act\nfor decades.\nWorking as a butler in a hotel, earning\nan honest living, saving up, and dreaming of a bright future, Nobbs is solely\nfocused on being good at her job. She\nhas very little interest in socialising or\nspeaking a word to her colleagues, and\nJohn Park\nDirector Rodrigo Garc\u00eda\nScreenwriters Glenn Close, John\nBanville, George Moore (short story)\nCast Glenn Close, Janet McTeer,\nMia Wasikowska, Aaron Johnson\nAlbert Nobbs\neveryone at the hotel agrees that she is\nnot only shy, but is also a bit of an ec-centric. The only real method she communicates with anyone is in her own\nroom, talking to herself as she counts\nthe money she has managed to save up\nover the years. It\u2019s sad and depressing\nto see a person this isolated, but this is\nall she has ever known, and she is fine\nwith it.\nClose may not look enough like a\nman on screen for everyone around to\nbe tricked by her disguise, but that is\nreally not the point here. She has had\nto pretend for most of her life, and this\nrestriction has naturally had an effect\non Nobbs, most notably her confi-dence. She is always on the look-out,\nparanoid and absolutely petrified at the\nthought that someone might find out.\nAnd Close\u2019s rigid and restrained performance perfectly embodies the nervous\nNobbs, as Close gives one of the most\nstirring, touching performances of the\nyear. She says very little, and is always\ncarefully mannered.\nHer secret however, doesn\u2019t stay\nburied forever. A painter, Hubert Page\n(McTeer), forced to share Albert\u2019s bed\ndue to a shortage of rooms, discovers\nNobbs\u2019 secret. It turns out Page is going through something similar of \u201cher\u201d\nown, and Nobbs is further intrigued\nwhen Page is revealed to be happily\nmarried, to a woman. Is it still possible\nto have a normal life, a person to fully\nlove and embrace you even if you happen to be a woman who dresses up as a\nman? Seeing Page, her wife, and their\nhome give Nobbs hope, and she turns\nher eyes to the young, beautiful Helen\n(Wasikowska), working as a maid in\nthe hotel.\nComplications arise though, as there\nis a young man also interested in Helen. Joe (Johnson), a boy hired off the\nstreet for knowing how to operate the\nhotel boiler, actually welcomes the fact\nthat Nobbs shows keen interest in his\ngirlfriend. He wants Helen to hang out\nwith Nobbs, and to squeeze out many\nmaterial gifts. Helen initially goes for\nthat idea, but as time goes by she realises that Nobbs is a strange yet nice\nman with manners, qualities her current\npassionate younger lover seems to lack.\nWasikowska is charming as the clueless young girl who may not be easy to\nlike at first, but does eventually win you\nover with her na\u00efve warmth. Johnson\non the other hand, plays his nasty piece\nof work with a hint of ambition, anger\nand jealousy, a mixture that results in\nintense confrontations and outbursts,\nsomething that Johnson handles well.\nDespite being a film revolving around\none woman\u2019s unique life, the director\ntakes his time to use his supporting\ncharacters rather than relying on one\noutstanding performance of a seasoned\nperformer. McTeer provides a reliable\nshoulder of support for our heroine\nwho often struggles to find her place in\nthe world, Brendan Gleeson, whenever\nhe sporadically shows up, is a funny,\nboozy doctor, a regular guest at the\nhotel, and Pauline Collins, the money-and-opportunity-grabbing lonely owner\nof the hotel, Mrs. Baker, manages to\nconvey the uptight, strict boss with both\nher wicked ways as well as with the occasional wit.\nThe problem with Albert Nobbs is\nthat even in the most crucial, emotional\nmoments, everything feels too slight\nand oddly doesn\u2019t explore the character\nof Albert further. A brief background\nstory is not sufficient enough to truly\nenrich an intriguing, yet highly unusual narrative such as this one. Most\nfrustrating of all, is the hastily written\nending. Most of the running time is\nspent on relatively tame events, that\nthe film never builds a strong momen-tum. It\u2019s sloppy, and leaves the film\u2019s\nstory hanging. Albert Nobbs is a clear\nshowcase for the versatile actress that\nClose is and has been for years, and\nyes, she does no doubt give an award-worthy performance that will be one of\nthe highlights of her distinguished ca-reer, but the muted atmosphere cannot\nquite keep up with the actress\u2019 intense\nperformance.\nI don\u2019t boil bunnies anymore! You must believe me!! I\u2019m not crazy!!!\n\n"

Dakar is the capital\nof Senegal, the most westerly point of\ncontinental Africa and over 5,500km\nfrom Paris. We will leave from Paris\nafter exams, nipping through the traffic and cutting into the calmer interior of France. We will travel along\nthe Way of St. James, a network of\npilgrimage routes converging on the\nCathedral of Santiago de Compostela in Galicia. We will depart from\nthe Way around the Pyrenees, long\nbefore Galicia in the north west of\nSpain. Through Spain we will aim for\nGibraltar, then taking the ferry across\nthe Straits to the port of Cueta in Morocco.\nThe ferry from Gibraltar marks a\nsignificant point in our journey. We\nleave behind Europe and all its sensibilities for the unfamiliar African\nleg of the trip. The route will mainly\nfollow the coast, offering a cooling\nbreeze from the Atlantic. In Morocco\nwe will pass through the chattering\nbazaars and enjoy vistas of the Atlas\nMountains. Leaving Morocco we will\nenter Western Sahara. Everything I\nknow about Western Sahara is from\nWikipedia. The first paragraph details the facts of it being a disputed\nterritory, one of the most sparsely\npopulated territories in the world and\nmainly consisting of desert flatlands.\nMy only first-hand connection with\nit is a friend who told me his friend\nvolunteered in a refugee camp there.\nWhen I try to imagine the view I will\nsee from my bike for days travelling\nthrough this country I can only see a\nblock of hot sand rising into a sky of\nhot blue.\nWestern Sahara passes into Mauritania. Entering near Nouadhibou, the\nroad becomes a desert track for 7 km\nand is bound on both sides by a mine-field. Sticking to the track it is safe\nenough but it sometimes happens that\nwild camels become victims of the\ndispute within sight. We will continue\nsouth, passing through gendarmerie\nmobile checkpoints every 30-100 km\napart, the scenery becoming greener\nas we pass out of the Sahara desert\ntowards our destination.\nAfter two months on the road, resting for a day every five days or so,\nwe should reach Dakar.

    "content": "FEATURE\nFELIX Friday 16 MARCH 2012 9\nthat I did not make the links between\nthis and my insomnia, some of the\nsubsequent changes in my behaviour,\nattitudes and emotional side, and the\nrelationships I had with important people in my life. This changed when last\nsummer I got a few snapshot flashbacks\nof what happened, and everything was\nsuddenly made clear. I felt anger that I\ndid, and still don\u2019t, know how to express\nor release. I felt that it was my fault for\nnot dealing with it earlier, and so I felt\ndeep, painful regret for what I had lost\nin the meantime and I soon slipped into\ndepression. I could not focus on work or\nother areas of my life, and outbursts of\nthese emotions sometimes (still) spring\nout of me at the slightest trigger. I guess\nwhat I am trying to say here is that I was\nvery na\u00efve and ignorant of how rape can\nhappen, and the serious effects it can\nhave on emotional, mental and physical\nwell-being in the longer term.\nI also had misconceptions of who and\nwhat counselling services are for, believing that they were only for people\nwith extremely serious difficulties. This\nmeant that I did not look for help from\na counselling service until I truly was\nin a dire state, and ultimately needed a\nlot more help. I believe that this is probably the case for many people at least in\nthe British society \u2013 admitting that one\nneeds counselling, and then that we are\ngoing to counselling, is still very taboo\nhere. It was only towards the end of this\nyear that I did not make up some excuse\nabout where I was going on Tuesday afternoons when people asked, again fearing awkwardness. It turns out that there\nwas no awkwardness at all, and I would\nencourage anyone else who is going or\nhas been, to be more open about visiting a counsellor. It is not just for those\nwith serious mental health issues, there\nis no reason to be ashamed for going,\nand contrary to what I initially thought,\nthey help enormously.\nI\n\u2019m a female Imperial Student\nand wrote this poem for you\nabout my mental health ex-periences. I feel down every\nfortnight or so, wasting hours\non the internet, having eating binges,\nnot being able to get anything done\nthat I wanted to or talk to anyone\nabout what I\u2019m going through. On\nthe outside I can be quite an outgoing and upbeat person! I do think I\nhave low self-esteem though. I have\nnever sought any help, partly due to\nthe stigma, partly because I deny that\nI do have a problem.\nUnderneath\nNo one knows what lies under the sur-face,\nIs it better that way?\nFeel I have to be fun around my friends\nOr they won\u2019t be friends anymore.\nSo I stay inside, safe in my own world,\nBut it\u2019s in my own world where my\nthoughts suffocate me.\nWhen the shadow passes I don\u2019t want to\ntalk about it anyway.\nJust pretend it never happened,\nTry to move on\nTo sunnier days.\nW\nhen I was 14 I developed depression.\nThings were really\ndifficult, I was self\nharming and missing a lot of school and I had completely\nlost my friends \u2013 it\u2019s a very isolating\nexperience. Even though I saw a psy-chologist, I couldn\u2019t talk to anyone \u2013 I\nfelt massively ashamed that I wasn\u2019t\ncoping, I\u2019d always been a high achiever\nand wasn\u2019t the \u201ctype\u201d to struggle so I\nput up this wall and refused to face up\nto things. It took several years of therapy before the depression and self harm\nstarted to be less present in my life \u2013\nI was 17 by the time I was discharged\nand outwardly coping pretty well with\nthings. I say outwardly as although I\u2019d\nmostly stopped self harming, it\u2019d been\nreplaced with an eating disorder. I\u2019d\nhad it for years before I finally told my\ndoctor about it, having moved to Imperial and finding things getting out of\ncontrol again \u2013 getting good grades and\nkeeping busy became a lot more stressful and pressurised in a uni environment\nthan back in 6th form and combined\nwith homesickness I just found myself\ncompletely overwhelmed. I\u2019m now\nwaiting to start treatment for my eating\ndisorder. I wish I\u2019d spoken out earlier\nand asked for help back when I first\nbecame ill but that\u2019s what makes mental health problems so difficult to cope\nwith. It\u2019s a lot easier to admit to having a cold or something physical than\nto admit that actually, things are really\ntough but talking about it is so impor-tant. Sometimes people react badly, but\noften they don\u2019t \u2013 without the support\nof people like my friends and my mum,\nthings would have been a lot harder.\nWe\u2019d really like to run more articles\nlike this.

    "content": "Laurence Pope takes some time out to chat to Michael Cook, a PhD student designing\n\u201cAs A.I. becomes more\nsophisticated and more\nable to create, hopefully it\nwill only serve to highlight\nwhat we value in human\ncreativity\u201d\nL\naurence: So, first question, for\nsomeone who\u2019s never heard of\nAngelina, how would you best describe it?\nMike: Angelina is just a piece of soft-ware, exactly like any other kind of application\non your computer. It needs a lot more resources\nto run, and what it essentially does is I set a few\nparameters, let it run, and it emails me when it\u2019s\ndone to let me know when a new game has been\nproduced. Inside there there\u2019s all kinds of artificial\nintelligence going on to produce these games. It\u2019s\nreally just your average bit of code running on the\nPC.\nL: What was it that prompted you to look into\nA.I. and base your research on this sort of soft-ware?\nM: I\u2019ve always played video games, and they\u2019ve\nalways been an interest, but A.I. in particular became of interest to me when I started computer\nscience at Imperial. There are a few streams you\ncan go down in computer science, but for me it\nwas always about the logic and making computers\ndo really unusual things. Video games are already\nan exotic thing for a computer to do anyway, pro-cedurally generated worlds, things like that.\nL: I\u2019ve read a couple of the articles that have\nFELIX\nFriday 16 march 2012\n40\ngames.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nGames Editor: Laurence Pope\nGAMES\nIt\u2019s not Crysis 2 quite yet I\u2019ll admit... (An Angelina designed game)\nGames by Angelina: Artificial\nalready been written, and I got the impression\nAngelina was very much in silico Darwinism.\nWould that be a fair assessment?\nM: I often relate it back to natural evolution, because I think it\u2019s a good touch point for people to\nunderstand computational evolution, and there are\na lot of similarities. It\u2019s probably best to talk about\nAngelina\u2019s evolutionary processes.\nComputational evolution is a very common A.I.\ntechnique used all over the place; medicine, en-gineering, pharmacology, all kinds of stuffs. It\u2019s\nbeen used in games before, so it\u2019s not something\nnew in that sense, we\u2019re just using it in a different\nway. In essence it\u2019s very much like evolution in\nthe real world. It\u2019s not really directed, there\u2019s no\nintentionality, at each step it\u2019s not clear where the\nprogram\u2019s moving. It\u2019s only when you step back\nand look at Angelina as a whole that you can understand where it was headed. It\u2019s just like evolution in the real world \u2013 it doesn\u2019t have a real goal,\nit\u2019s just a process that happens naturally.\nIt has helped to think of this as an evolutionary process, because normally evolutionary processes in computing are just one thing, one species of animal, but in Angelina we have multiple\nspecies evolving alongside one another, and they\nexert pressures on one another, just as two species\nwould in a natural environment. So if a level design starts to tend toward a particular feature the\npower ups will have to alter their design to compensate for that.\nL: At the moment Angelina can\u2019t add in graphics or audio on its own. What\u2019s the raw product\nlook like before you spruce it up?\nM: It looks pretty much like the Santa games up\non my website now. It\u2019s the stock stuff sitting there\njust waiting to be used. I often put in a lot of the visual touches later, especially if I\u2019m making a game\nfor something like the New Scientist game. If you\ngo back further, before the platform games, you\ncan see what they were really like, when they were\nsimplistic, little more than basic coloured shapes\non the screen.\nIn a way I feel that some of the coverage I\u2019ve\ngotten has been a little cheap; the screenshots\nmake it look very clever, but I did all that art. The\ngood thing is my PhD supervisor, Simon Colton,\ndoes lots of work in A.I. generated art, so we\u2019re\ngoing to look into ways to get Angelina to be a bit\nartier in future all by itself.\nL: So it\u2019s likely that Angelina will soon be able\nto add in simple graphics all by itself, but what\nabout higher resolution stuff? For example, do\nyou think Angelina will be able to create a game\nas visually rich as Team Fortress 2?\nM: Yes, eventually. The idea of computational\ncreativity is quite interesting, because researchers\nlike ourselves are struggling with defining a grade\nof creativity. For instance, writing the Felix article\nyou\u2019re going to write requires a certain level of\ncreativity, but reading it also requires a certain level as well in order to visualise some of the things\nyou\u2019re discussing. Now you could argue that\nthey\u2019re two quite different levels of creativity, one\nbeing much higher than the other. Currently, some\naspects of Angelina feel creative, but we don\u2019t really consider the system very creative at all.\nYou could go some steps up and have Angelina\ndesign artwork based on existing things in the\nworld. It could say look on Google images of images of people or soldiers and restyle them in a\nparticular painting style. That would be one form\nof creativity.\nTo generate the kind of high-quality art style\nseen in TF2 from scratch would take a very long\ntime, but definitely Angelina will start to make\nstrides towards that eventually. 8-bit is just a convenient start point.\nL: You\u2019ve said before you believe Angelina has\nbenefit for game designers, but do you think it\nhas any use outside of that?\nM: It\u2019d be better to say research like Angelina,\nas I\u2019m obviously not the only person looking into\nthis sort of A.I. There\u2019s a bunch of different ways I\nhope it\u2019ll affect the games industry.\nOne of the ways as you say is that it\u2019ll give designers more powerful design tools to work with.\nSecondly, from the opposite end of things, which\nis that people like you or I will be better able to\ndesign games, because tools like Angelina will be\nable to boost people up, just like Photoshop has\nboosted my photoediting skills in general. It\u2019ll help\nus make more intelligent and interesting games for\nourselves, which are still designed but are amplified by the effects of intelligent tools.\nThirdly I hope that\u2019ll lead to really interesting\ngames, and that\u2019s a benefit for everyone. In computational creativity we often think about how A.I.\ncan emulate existing human creativity. We talk\nabout how A.I. artists could paint paintings that\nhumans might, or design games that designers\nAn exclusive look at Michael\u2019s next line of Angelina-based research \u2013 the building of\npuzzle games with a series of levels and increasing difficulty\n\n"

After Christmas we were joint top of the league with Kings,\nbut an unfortunate loss against them a couple\nof weeks ago means that we will most likely\nfinish second in the league.

We have been known many\ntimes to turn up with the bare 11 players, but\nthe girls have shown great commitment and\ncompetitiveness and have had a magnificent\ntime so far. This season has seen the team play\nsome of their best, expansive hockey and we\nhave gained promotion in our BUCS league, to\n1A, with one game in hand; as well as winning\nthe ULU premier league. These are massive\nachievements for the team, made even harder\nby great runs in both the ULU and BUCS cups,\nresulting in reaching the final of both. With the\nhelp and dedication of our coach Oli Bell, the\nteam has trained hard and as a result has only\nlost one match so far this season, but with two\nfinals and a potential rearranged varsity match\nahead the hardest are yet to come.

Warner\nThe legendary Cecil B. DeMille\u2019s last silent film, it does have its\nodd, completely original material (including its fairly creative\nopening in which Mary Magdalene, possessed by the Seven Deadly Sins, searches for her lover, Judah Iscariot), but he does mostly\nstick to the events outlined by the Bible. He doesn\u2019t put everything\nin order, but Hollywood\u2019s most ambitious director does a fine job\nadding more of his unique touch. The famous resurrection scene,\none of two sequences in the film shown in colour, remains as powerful as ever.\nKing of Kings (1961) \u2013 Jeffrey Hunter\nReleased by the same studio (MGM) a couple of years after their\nenormous success of Ben-Hur, even the poster for King of Kings\nshared a similar style to the Oscar-winning Charlton Heston epic.\nSo imagine everyone\u2019s disappointment when the box office returns\nwere weak. The mass appeal of its attractive sparkling blue-eyed\nHunter couldn\u2019t pull in massive numbers at the cinemas, although\nhis youthful look did give the film its lasting nickname of I Was\na Teenage Jesus, a parody of the title I Was a Teenage Werewolf\n(1957).\nThe Gospel According to St. Matthew (1964) \u2013 Enrique\nIrazoqui\nFamous for having most of its dialogue taken straight out of Matthew\u2019s Gospel, Pier Paolo Pasolini\u2019s take on Jesus is unique in\nthe way that the director himself couldn\u2019t be further from being\na devout Christian. With his reputation of being an atheist, homosexual and Marxist individual, he doesn\u2019t sentimentalise nor\ndoes he glorify the story \u2013 instead he chooses to keep an accurate\nrecord of events. Most refreshing however, is Irazoqui\u2019s aggressive,\noutspoken Jesus.\nGodspell (1973) \u2013 Victor Garber\nThe fact that this is set in the 70s New York should immediately\ntell you that Godspell: A Musical Based on the Gospel According to\nSt. Matthew (its full title) is not your typical film telling the story of\nJesus. Yet its fresh, comical approach, smart and never offensive,\nfull of entertaining, catchy tunes written by Stephen Schwartz (now\nan Oscar-winning composer for Disney) is exactly the reason for\nthe film\u2019s timeless appeal. Jesus does dress up as a clown here,\nall the more reason to seek this one out.\nGospel Road (1973) \u2013 Robert Elfstrom\nThe year 1973 saw the release of three musical films based on\nthe life of Jesus Christ and perhaps the most memorable one is\nthe feature sung and narrated by American country singer Johnny\nCash. His wife June Carter Cash stars as Mary Magdalene, and\nwith its on location shoot in Israel, combine these with Cash\u2019s\noriginal songs in his signature performance style perfectly suiting\nthe film\u2019s every scene, what could have been a cheesy, tacky music\nvideo turns into a touching, sincere piece.\nThe Greatest Story Ever Told (1965) \u2013 Max von Sydow\nAn expensive flop for United Artists, von Sydow plays Jesus\namongst the starry ensemble cast that includes Charlton Heston,\nClaude Raines, Jose Ferrer, John Wayne, Angela Lansbury, Sidney\nPoitier and Shelley Winters. This epic tale of massive proportions\n(e.g. its 260-minute running time), there is no denying that this is\na challenging, butt-aching watch, but the sheer ambition and vision director George Stevens carried with the project is well worth\na watch, perhaps not in a single sitting though.\nThe Passion of the Christ (2004) \u2013 Jim Caviezel\nThe brutal yet riveting portrayal of the last few hours of Christ\u2019s\nlife is an unforgettably raw and bloody experience, and yet the\nviolence seems never unnecessary or over-the-top. Whether you\nbelieve in this story or not shouldn\u2019t prevent you from being completely drawn in. Mel Gibson\u2019s reputation may have gone downhill\nover the recent years but his directorial achievement here is unquestionably bold and unique, putting his lead, the usually quiet\nyet intense Caviezel through many tough physical ordeals.\nThe Last Temptation of Christ (1988) \u2013 Willem Dafoe\nA more human, perhaps more relatable take on the Crucifixion, Jesus contemplates a quieter, less painful life with his \u201clove\u201d Mary\nMagdalene. Plagued by doubt, depression and lust, this brave departure from what the scripture says attracted a fair amount of con-torversy for director Martin Scorsese, but it\u2019s a contemplative piece\nand an interesting spin on a widely accepted story. Christians, try\nto watch and absorb with an open mind. Non-Christians, indulge in\nthis honest bit of filmmaking by one of Hollywood\u2019s finest.\nJesus Christ Superstar (1973) \u2013 Ted Neeley\nIt was only a matter of time before Andrew Lloyd Webber\u2019s smash\nhit, award-winning stage musical Jesus Christ Superstar caught\nthe attention of film studio bosses. Two years after its stage debut,\nWebber\u2019s biblical tale made it to the screens and was met with\nmixed reviews. There is no doubting Webber\u2019s talent when it comes\nto music composition, but Neeley\u2019s Jesus has been criticised as\nbeing more \u201cwhiny than heroic\u201d with its general tone being \u201cmonotonous\u201d and \u201ctedious,\u201d never a good sign for a musical.\n\n"

Freud,\nfrom his beginnings one of the greatest artists\nof the 20th Century, has struggled with his\nart, learning and challenging himself up to his\ndeath last summer at the age of 88. Until then,\nhe had been working closely with the National\nPortrait Gallery to prepare this exhibition;\none of the painting was left unfinished, its striking incompleteness proof of his energy.\nDramatic tension tinges every single one of\nhis paintings, an undercurrent of conflict that\nbrought about by the awkward positions of the\nbody, the unnatural perspectives or the violence\nof his brushtrokes. One wonders whether the\nsitters he chose were troubled themselves or\nwhether it was Freud\u2019s own vision that impregnated his paintings with drama.\nHis early painting possess a unnatural flatness\nand a obessive precision that echos old Flemish\nartists. Portraits of Kitty Garman, Freud\u2019s first\nwife, are dominated by her huge absorbing\neyes, which resemble the females populating\nthe paintings of Paul Delvaux, pupils dilated as\na result of belladona. Freud deliberately depicts\nsurreal cartoon-like figures who appear trapped\nin their own, flat, world.\nShowing some flesh\nThe bold brustrokes and the myriad of tones\nthat mark Freud\u2019s style do not appear until the\n1950\u2019s during which time he started to develop\nhis fixation on the human body. \u2018Woman smil-ing, a portrait of Susy Boyt\u2019, marks this transi-tion: her skin has texture and feeling, and we\ncan perceive the bone structure that supports\nthis skin. This is one of the few paintings Freud\ndid where the subject is smiling.\nFreud\u2019s talents now unleashed a powerful\nwhirl of skin tones and thick brushstrokes that\nseem to sculpt rather than paint human flesh.\nFrank Auerbach\u2019s portrait is a beautifully crafted piece, were the sitter appears to emerge out\nfrom the canvas. Auerbach was a close friend\nof Freud and Francis Bacon, all three of whom\nwere significant figures of the School of London movement in the 80s which revindicated\nfigurative painting and tried to bring it back to\nthe art galleries.\nHalfway through the show, there is a drastic change in the size and magnificence of the\npieces. The last rooms contain inmense can-vases, which cover the walls with voluptous\nflesh. The encounter between Freud and Leigh\nBowery lead to one of the most thriving stages\nof Freud\u2019s career. Leigh Bowery was a performance artist whose hefty body and physical\nawareness inspired Freud. Bowery introduced\nto Freud to his most well-known muse, Big\nSue. Her massive body nurtured Freud\u2019s obsession with flesh and its changeable nuances.\nFreud Portraits will remain in the memory\nof all of those who go to see it, a mark hard to\nremove if ever that was desirable.

The presidency of France is\nup for grabs once again and will be contested in two rounds on 22 April and 6\nMay. In 1981, the French people chose\nleft over right and booted out the unpopular incumbent. It is not unrealistic\nto think that we could see a replay of this\nunusual situation in the upcoming elec-tions.\nFran\u00e7ois Hollande, the centre-left\nSocialist Party presidential candidate,\nhas been ahead in the polls for the past\nfive months. Hollande\u2019s ideas appeal to\nmany in France, but critics point out that\nhe has never held government office and\ndoesn\u2019t possess the charisma a president should exhibit. In his manifesto, he\nvows to introduce higher tax rates for\nhigh earners, scrap tax breaks and create\n60,000 new teaching posts. In February\nhe proposed a 75% marginal tax rate on\nincomes above 1,000,000 euros, which\nis higher than Sweden\u2019s top marginal tax\nrate. This was a bold step and a change\nfrom his earlier proposed marginal tax\nrate of 45% on incomes above 150,000\neuros. In January he announced, \u201cMy\ntrue adversary does not have a name, a\nface, or a party. He never puts forward\nhis candidacy, but nevertheless he gov-erns. My true adversary is the world of\nfinance.\u201d\nShortly after the February tax pro-posal, Hollande visited London, where\nhe sought to rally the support of the\n300,000-strong expatriate French community residing in the British capital,\nthe majority of whom voted for Nicolas\nSarkozy five years ago. He met with Labour leader Ed Miliband and the shadow\ncabinet and gave a speech at King\u2019s College to supporters and students. David\nCameron, however, turned down his request for a meeting.\nThe British Prime Minister has made\nit clear that he supports the incumbent\npresident \u2013 in an interview with Le Figaro he called him \u201ca brave politician\u2019\u201d\nand stated that \u201cNicolas Sarkozy has my\nsupport, I say it clearly\u201d. The presidential candidate came under attack during his five-year term for his perceived\nimmodesty and flamboyant lifestyle,\nleading to the moniker \u2018bling bling\npresident\u2019. Some think that he used his\nprivate life to strategically divert media\nattention from political issues, for example when he announced his divorce\nfrom longtime wife C\u00e9cilia on the same\nday as one of the first strikes against his\nreform program unfolded.\nHis merits include pushing through\neconomic reforms in the wake of the\nfinancial crisis and an assertive foreign\npolicy. He led the successful military\nintervention in Libya and strengthened\nrelations with other European coun-tries, in particular with Great Britain \u2013\non military relations and collaboration\non civil nuclear energy. The dynamic\nduo of the German Chancellor Angela\nMerkel and Nicolas Sarkozy, known as\n\u2018Merkozy\u2019, tackled the Eurozone crisis\nwith zeal. Merkel said earlier this year\nthat \u201cI support Nicolas Sarkozy across\nthe line as we belong to friendly (politi-cal) parties\u201d.\nAlthough Cameron and Merkel have\nbacked the French president\u2019s re-elec-tion bid, it is the French people who get\nto decide whether he can stay or not.\nFran\u00e7ois Hollande is not the only opponent in the first round. Marine Le Pen,\npresident of the right-wing National\nFront, announced on Tuesday that she\nhad secured the backing of 500 elected\nofficials, required to be able to stand in\nthe presidential race. She is popular \u2013\naccording to an ifop poll 16% of French\npeople support her, which makes her the\nthird horse in the race. She finds support\namong traditionally rightwing voters and\nincreasingly among the unemployed,\nwho support her anti-immigration, Eurosceptic and protectionist policies. The\nNational Front\u2019s appeal has increased,\nowing to the current economic crisis and\nthe softer image projected by a young\nand polished Marine Le Pen.\nThe other presidential candidates\ninclude Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou of the centrist Democratic Movement, who came\nthird in the first round in 2007 \u2013 he is\nnow fourth in the ifop poll with 13% of\nFrench people intending to vote for him\nin the first round. Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon\nis a left-wing candidate who has been\npolling 10% support. He was originally\na member of the Socialist Party, but\nbroke away and founded his own party\nFront de Gauche (Left Front) in 2008.\nOn Tuesday, after five months in the\nlead for Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, polls indicated a reversal of fortunes for the first\nround, with 28.5% of French people\nsupporting Nicolas Sarkozy and 27%\nsupporting Fran\u00e7ois Hollande \u2013 only\nlast week the situation was the other way\nround. The polls give Hollande a comfortable lead for the second round.\nNicolas Sarkozy attended a mass rally\nthis week where he announced that the\nSchengen treaty that permits free movement of people between European states\nhad to be renegotiated, otherwise he\nwould pull out of it. He also proclaimed\na protectionist \u2018Buy European Law\u2019.\nThis can be seen as trying to win back\nBetween a rock and a hard place: I don\u2019t envy the French people\nvotes from Le Pen supporters. This\ncould lie behind the bump in support\nseen in Tuesday\u2019s ifop poll. He is not\none to cede to triumphalism, at least not\nyet.\nThe opinions of students are, however,\nvaried. One Imperial student I talked\nto is not enthused by this year\u2019s presidential campaign and complains that\n\u2018France is going straight into a recession\nand they are debating on whether the\nmeat in supermarkets is halal or not\u2019. He\nsays the solution is to see through and\ncontinue with the policies introduced\nby Sarkozy \u2013 here he emphasizes that\nhe doesn\u2019t approve of Sarkozy \u2013 and is\nafraid that the election will effectively\namount to a referendum on Sarkozy and\nnot the result of a battle of ideas. Another French student is considering voting\nfor Hollande and approves of his support\nfor small and medium enterprises, which\nshe says would promote innovation, and\nabove all is wooed by the theme of social justice in his campaign.\n\u201cThe British Prime\nMinister has made it\nclear he supports the\nincumbent\u201d\nReuters\n\n"

It\u2019s interesting because it could\nlead to new genres of games or new mechanics\nthat we might never have thought of.\nHopefully, as researchers get closer to the public\na lot of our research will get released for free, and\na lot of our games are released for free.

It\u2019s impossible to think that these won\u2019t have an effect\non people, because in a sense the app market has\nalready experienced these problems before, in\nthat it\u2019s already quite easy to make a basic app. If\nwe make that process even easier we\u2019d certainly\nsee flushes of very simple apps. One of the next\nprojects I\u2019m working on with Angelina is puzzle\ngames, and I\u2019ve already realised that the kind of\ncomplexity we could potentially create, those apps\nare already being sold now for \u00a30.69. It would not\nbe beyond the stretches of imagination to have Angelina do that.\nIf that were to happen, I hope that what we\nwould see is that the minimum level of what we\nconsider interesting would rise. It would no longer\nbe interesting to us to see the next Zynga game,\nand that could be a great thing. It might be that in\nthe future Angleina would be on everyone\u2019s com-puter, and they could push a button and let it make\na game for them, so that they don\u2019t have to spend\n\u00a30.69 on another.\nThen, people would take an interest in games that\nare truly creative and truly inventive. Of course,\nthe question is what would happen when Angelina\npushes up to that level, if it ever could. My feeling is that as A.I. becomes more sophisticated and\nmore able to create, hopefully it will only serve to\nhighlight what we value in human creativity.\nFor me people like Edmund McMillen, who\nmade Super Meat Boy and The Binding of Isaac,\nand Derek Yu, who made Aquaria and Spelunky,\nMichael has plans to use a new library called APACE to allow Angelina to create point-and-click adventures\nthose people communicate something very unique\nthrough their games, something very deep about\nwho they are. I\u2019ll always be interested in buying\ntheir games, and I don\u2019t think an A.I. could ever\nreplicate that connection between me and the de-signer.\nGames like Battlefield 4 are going to be highly\nmechanical games. There\u2019s going to be a lot of\nequations that need balancing, a lot of weapons,\ngeneric vehicles and levels that will need to be balanced and created. Those games might find themselves being impacted by Angelina.\nIf you look at the indie market and the huge\nswathes of inventiveness, uniqueness and human\nconnection between the games and the people that\nmake them, they will be, if anything, the very\nlast games to go if they should ever be affected\nby these tools. This is where the real art shines\nthrough. My supervisor always says \u201cPhotoshop\ndidn\u2019t ruin fine artists,\u201d and I don\u2019t think these\ntools will either. What they might do is flush out\npeople who are getting away with churning out the\nsame app every week. Maybe those people will\nsee their incomes affected, but hopefully it\u2019ll encourage them to go after projects they really love,\nrather than just chasing the current trend. Maybe\nit\u2019ll be a bad thing for the industry; I really hope\nit isn\u2019t!\nL: For me certainly, I\u2019ve never been a fan of\nthose mechanical shooters that come on year on\nyear, so I do think it\u2019ll have a positive effect.\nM: Yes, and I think that eventually, whether or\nnot these tools are released, if they become useful\nprivate companies like Activision will build their\nown, and they\u2019ll have a lot of money to spend on\nR&D. It may be that their tools will far surpass\nwhatever I could ever produce to make the next\nBattlefield, in which case you\u2019ll see these games\ncoming out, because they\u2019ll always have the edge\nwith technology.\nOf course, not all creative or inventive game developers are indie; Valve\u2019s games have a terrific\npersonality, and those things will always be here.\nYou can\u2019t match them with A.I. You can\u2019t replace\nthat human element. Humans have slaved over\ntheir work and it shows; Angelina can\u2019t emulate\nthat, and nor would we want her to. That\u2019s another\nquestion. There are a lot of things the industry are\nCompanies like Activision will probably have\nto up their game in one way or another\nnot interested in.\nL: There was a comment made by Mark Nelson,\nclaiming that Angelina should be more trans-parent, and should allow designers to change\nwhat they want. Do you believe what he says?\nM: Mark is a really awesome researcher, and a lot\nSuper Meat Boy \u2014 a highlight of human\ncreativity in the gaming industry\nof his papers spurred on the research that I did. I\nkind of brought that quote on myself. When I talk\nabout Angelina in interviews like this I often talk\nabout it being used in conjunction with designers\nand things like that. Really, it\u2019s the research around\nAngelina that will go on to be used. Angelina itself\nin an autonomous designer, it can\u2019t be used in conjunction with human designers.\nMark on the other hand has worked on building tools that collaborate with a human. For those\ntools it\u2019s very important that humans can express\nwhat they\u2019re looking for. With Angelina it requires\na lot of tinkering with the code, when I run it it\ndoesn\u2019t ask me what I think. There are a lot of\ngreat tools like Tanagra, a level design tool. You\nstart to make a 2D level for a game like Mario, and\nas you make the level Tanagra watches and tries\nto work out what kind of level you\u2019re after, and it\nstarts to fill in the level ahead of you. You can tell\nit to change things, but it tries to collaborate and\nInterested in more?\nIf you\u2019re interested in finding out more\nabout Michael\u2019s research or fancy trying\nout one of Angelina\u2019s games check out\nhis website and blog:\nhttp://www.gamesbyangelina.org/\n\u201cA.I. might offer another\nform of creativity, games\nwhich humans could never\nmake themselves\u201d\ndesign alongside you.\nMy aim with Angelina will always be to make a\ndesigner that works on its own and designs games\nwithout me.\nTools need more transparency, but Angelina\ndoesn\u2019t. Hopefully her research will spurn on the\ndevelopment of more development tools however.\nL: So the final question I had \u2013 Angelina, where\ndid the name come from?\nM: In computing, there seems to be a tendency for\nreally terrible acronyms. There are many dreadful\nexamples! Angelina\u2019s acronym is A Novel GameEvolving Labrat. It\u2019s tail-recursive, which I find\nhilarious, but I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s at all funny outside\nof computer science departments \u2013 or even within\nthem!\nL: Thank you very much for your time. Good\nluck with your research!\nM: Cheers!\n41\n\n"

    "content": "TELEVISION\nFELIX Friday 16 MarCH 2012 37\ntv.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nTelevision Editors: George Barnett\nJames Simpson\nAbrams vs. Alcatraz\nC\nreated by J.J. Abrams, the mastermind behind Lost and Fringe,\nAlcatraz follows a special unit\nwithin the FBI dedicated to investigating the disappearance of the\nprisoners and guards from the infamous prison\nin 1963. The year is 2012 and the 63s, as they\nare commonly referred to, have started showing\nup the same age as when they disappeared and\nwith no memory of how they vanished, or where\nthey\u2019ve been for the past 50 years.\nHeading the investigation is Emerson Hauser,\nan FBI agent who also served as an officer on\nAlcatraz in the 60s. Played by Sam Neill (Juras-sic Park), his main goal is to capture the convicts as they arrive in the present day, while also\ntrying to figure out how they disappeared in the\nfirst place. His character is generally quite cynical with many hidden agendas. He is aided in his\nquest by Rebecca Madsen, an SFPD homicide\ndetective with familial ties to Alcatraz. Jorge\nGarcia (Lost) rounds off the main cast as Dr Diego \u2018Doc\u2019 Soto, an author of books about Alcatraz and comic book shop owner. His in-depth\nknowledge of all of the inmates has proven invaluable and his character provides some much\nneeded light-heartedness.\nVoted as one of eight Most Exciting New Series, the show first aired in the US in January\nand has followed an \u2018inmate-of-the-week\u2019 for-mat. Each episode therefore follows the team as\nthey chase down the newest prisoner to return\nfrom who\u2013knows\u2013where, as well as showing\nflash-backs from said prisoner\u2019s time at Alcatraz. The warden, deputy warden and head\ndoctor at Alcatraz are crucial characters in\nthese flashbacks, showing us that many of the\nguards were every bit as cruel and criminally\ninclined as the convicts themselves.\nAfter 10 episodes, we are still no closer to\ndiscovering the secrets behind Alcatraz. The\nplot is easy to follow, but each new episode\nbrings up more questions. Background\ninformation about the main characters\nthemselves is also quite scarce, but then\nit is still early days. So far it is clear\nthat they all have a few skeletons in their\nclosets. The disappearance seems scientific in its nature, with numerous references made to the works of Jules\nVerne. In typical J.J. fashion questions of morality and religion are investigated, whilst psychology and brain-washing also play an important\nrole. Why and how did over 300 people disappear all at once? Where have they been and why\ndo they have no memory of how it happened, yet\nknow to look for certain objects hidden in various locations in San Francisco?\nBeing a great fan of Lost and Fringe, I was excited to hear about Abrams\u2019 new project. The\nelement of time-travel was not at all sur-prising, but the idea behind it was something unique. The series is\ndefinitely entertaining\nto watch, but it lacks the\npunch and fast pace\nof his other\nshows. I guess the main issue I have thus far is\nhow unconcerned everyone is with the fact that\npeople are popping up from the past. After an\ninitial \u2018is everyone else\u2019s head exploding right\nabout now\u2019moment in the first episode, Rebecca\nand Doc just take it at face value and stop questioning it. Even the inmates themselves don\u2019t\nseem too concerned about suddenly finding\nthemselves in the future and adapt to the present very quickly. I also question the inmates\u2019ongoing compulsion to carry out the crimes they\nwere originally caught and imprisoned for.\nDespite these drawbacks, I still think Alcatraz\nis an enjoyable watch and I look forward to new\nepisodes every week. It has all of the elements\nat hand to make it a great show. With only three\nmore episodes until the end of the season,\nI\u2019m sure the writers will keep us\nLucia Podhorska breaks out a review of Alcatraz\nPick of the week\nFacebook\u2019s actually quite boring isn\u2019t it?

Increasingly we\nare working with adult men and adolescent boys. Consistently the research\nshows that men also have body image\nconcerns. There is also research being\ndone with children as young as four\nyears of age and adults as old as 80\nyears of age. It is an issue across the\nlifespan for everybody.\nN: At Imperial we have a strong gender imbalance \u2013 do you see this as an\nissue and do you see it impacting on\nbody image?\nP: In terms of it impacting on body image I couldn\u2019t really say. I don\u2019t know\nof any research that has looked at that\ndirectly so it\u2019s a bit of a leap to talk\nabout that in relation to body image.\nN:At Imperial we live in a reasonably\nhigh stress environment \u2013 is there a\nrelation between academic performance pressure and body image?\nP: There are studies that show people\nwho have a negative body image are\nless likely to participate in class. There\nwas also a study that showed that students with high body image concerns\n[performed worse academically] than\nstudents who didn\u2019t.\nN: The fashion industry is often\nblamed for people\u2019s obsession with\ntheir bodies. Is this fair?\nP: It\u2019s fair in that the fashion industry\nhas a role to play \u2013 I don\u2019t think it\u2019s\nfair when they are blamed exclusively.\nI think there are a lot of industries that\nbenefit from reinforcing narrow beauty\nideals that contribute to body image\nconcerns. Certainly I would like to see\nmore diversity in the types of people\nand appearances that they use and rep-resent, and there\u2019s a lot of research, including some that I\u2019ve done, that shows\nthat if advertisements use more diverse\nand larger size models it has a positive\nimpact on people\u2019s body image. I think\nthere\u2019s a lot of room for improvement\nbut I think it\u2019s important to focus on the\npositives and we are starting to see initiatives from within the fashion industry which are about promoting diversity\nin appearance.\nN: Do you know of any other cultures\nwhere media and the fashion industry don\u2019t have the same impact?\nP: No, not really. There is some research that shows that with increasing\nexposure to westernised media there is\nan increase in body image concerns and\ndisordered eating behaviours. There\nwas a study that looked at body image\nand disordered eating among adolescent girls in Fiji before and after television was introduced and they found a\nsignificant increase afterwards. I don\u2019t\nknow that we would be able to make\nany significant comparisons with any\ncultures where the media isn\u2019t an is-sue. The research focuses on western\ncultures and the impact of westernised\nmedia.\nN: Is there an ideal body size?\nP: I\u2019d say there is an ideal body size\nthat is unique for every individual and\nthat is probably what I would call the\n\u2018healthy ideal\u2019, when they are at a body\nsize that is comfortable to them and\nwhen they have a healthy relationship\nwith food and exercise.\nN: You\u2019ve mentioned men a couple of\ntimes \u2013 we have a lot of men at Imperial. I wonder how body image issues\nin men compare to body image issues\nin women.\nP: It\u2019s difficult to make direct comparisons \u2013 most of the research focuses on\none or the other, but there is an increasing amount of focus on men. We did\nsome research in collaboration with\nthe SUCCEED foundation that was focused on body image in adult men in\nthe UK. What we found is that men are\nconcerned with body image and that it\nimpacts on different areas in their lives.\nIt\u2019s really hard to make clear comparisons with women, and it has traditionally been seen as a women\u2019s issue, but\nthe study that we did also looked at\nhow men talk about their appearance\nwith other men, and how often they do\ntalk about it, and 80% of men said they\nregularly engage in conversations that\nfocus on appearance and reinforce their\nown beauty ideas. The vast majority of\nmen said they wished they looked different to the way they did, with a heavy\nfocus on muscularity, hair and height.\nN: What impact would you say men\ncan have on women\u2019s body image and\nis there anything men can look out\nfor and try to do differently?\nP: It\u2019s not so much what men can do\nto women \u2013 it\u2019s what everyone can do.\nOne thing that everybody can do is\nnot engage in \u2018body-talk\u2019 or \u2018fat-talk\u2019,\nwhich is commenting on another person\u2019s body weight and shape whether\nthat\u2019s complimentary or in a negative\nway because what that subtly does is\nreinforce that how we all look is impor-tant, and people value that.\nIf you have any questions or would\nlike to get involved with the SUCCEED programme but can\u2019t come\nto the talk on Monday 19 March at\n12:30-13:30 in SAFB 121 then get\nin touch with dpwelfare@imperial.\nac.uk\n\n"

Arriving at the Coventry Sports & Leisure\nCentre, the team were brimming with\n(as much) enthusiasm (as is possible at\n8am in Coventry) on their first outing at\nthis great tournament.\nThe initial group stage saw Imperial\nin a group with Aberdeen A, Bangor,\nYork B, and Warwick B. Aberdeen A\nwere the favourites to win the group and\nchallenge for the trophy. Our team captain Jeeves Dattani, having previously\ncaptained Warwick B, was keen for a\nstrong win over his old side.\nThe first match was against York B,\nand started in a disastrous fashion with\nan early goal conceded on the counter-attack. The remainder was fairly close\nhowever, and goals from Jeeves Dattani, Joe Slade and Jonny Ely saw the\nteam through to a 5-3 win.\nThe next match saw Imperial face the\ndaunting prospect of Aberdeen A \u2013 a\nstrong team who trounced Warwick 7-1\n\u2013 our closest rivals in the group. Some\nplayer recruitment was needed, and as\nteams are allowed two players from different universities Kerstin Schillinger\n(University of Kent) and Gordon Proctor (Royal Holloway) \u2013 also playing for\ntheir respective barbarian teams \u2013 joined\nin. Aberdeen showed much of the same\nattacking spirit against Imperial as they\nhad against Warwick B, winning 7-0 in\na strongly fought but ultimately unsuccessful match.\nNext on the cards were Bangor, a previous tournament host (with possibly\nthe worst after-party in living memory),\nwere easily walked over with a 9-1 win\nwith goals coming from nearly all our\nplayers. With one match left to play,\nthings were set for a second place de-cider. Imperial against Warwick B, the\nwinner finishing second with a draw\nmeaning Warwick B would finish on\ntop due to goal difference. The match\nstarted badly with Warwick B scoring\nthe first goal, but the team\u2019s determination came through bringing the score to\n2-2. With a minute left to play Joe Slade\nskipped past two Warwick defenders to\nscore the winner.\nImperial finished second in their\ngroup; a fantastic result for their first\nouting at the tournament putting them\ninto a group with all of the other second placed teams from the other groups.\nThese were: Warwick A, Warwick Barbarians, Plymouth Barbarians and Oxford (Barbarian teams are made up of\nformer students). This was a much more\nexperienced group with heavy defeats at\nthe hands of Warwick A, Warwick Barbarians and Plymouth Barbarians. Their\nonly hope remained in beating Oxford.\nA now tired and worn Imperial team\ntook to the water and conceded the first\ngoal \u2013 starting the match on the back\nfoot. This continued and despite scoring\ntwo goals past Oxford, courtesy of Jonny Ely and Andy Strang, they lost 6-2.\nThis was a fantastic experience for\na young team who had never played\ntogether before, and an overall tournament finish of 7th out of 18 university\nteams and 10th out of 25 overall was a\ngood result which we will look to improve on next year.\nWe train every week at St. Mary\u2019s\npool, Paddington, at 7pm on\nMondays \u2013 usually followed by\na pint at the Fountains Abbey.\nMeet in the Beit Quad at 6pm \u2013\nall you need to bring is swimming\ngear and we\u2019ll provide the rest of\nkit for the session.

It cradles\nyou beyond boredom, tucking you neatly in\nyour comfort zone, knowing that the next\nthree minutes are going to be exactly the\nsame. No change. No worries.\nThen there\u2019s jazz. As feared by Vince Noir\n\u201cEver second, a\nbreath suspended.\nA veritable vertigo of\nanticipation.\u201d\nmonotonous structure is a poor man\u2019s kalei-doscope, recycling a simple pattern ad nau-seam.\nRhythm is the reappearance of sound in particular patterns. But couldn\u2019t playing a sound\nonce be enough? Once it has become, why\nsummon back its memory? It remains a constant affirmation of its non-vanishment, a reminder of something that cannot last forever.\nIs it an attempt to remind you what it sounded like \u2013 massaging your ears once more in\ncase you forgot how it felt? Or is it an attempt\nto recycle the past? Why do what has already\nbeen done?\nSurely there is a better representation of\nsound in its subordinance to the time domain\n\u2013 an ever fleeting object continually disappearing into the past. Something to be left as\na memory and perhaps recall it in a synpatic\ndisturbance. Or does the recollection serve to\nkeep us in a single moment, conveying something greater than time would allow?\nOur memory can hold a moment forever,\nsuspending everything, all at once. We can\nexperience a tremendous amount in a single\ninstant and condense the greatest of spaces\ninto the finest point.\nTime is too precious to linger on.\nReviewed in\n60 Seconds\nRoman Fl\u00fcgel\nWaste It All\n2012\nDespite its five track length and status as an EP,\nWaste It All could well stand as the most diverse set\nof recordings London-based \u2018nugaze\u2019 group Spc Eco\n(founded by Dean Garcia of Curve, and his daughter,\nRose Berlin) have ever put out.\nThe tracks recorded with Skylight employ a slower,\nmore guitar-heavy mix than Eco\u2019s usually dreamy ma-terial, with Rose\u2019s vocals pushed lower in the mix. The\nEP as a whole is harsher than their older sound, with\nsome tracks notably employing a kind of dubstep-style\n\u2018dirty\u2019 (awful word) bassline.\nSomehow, it works. If you like checking out local\ntalent be sure to grab this.\nRoss Gray\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2729\nExperimental electronic musician Ricardo Tobar\nproves once again that dance can fully transcend its\nboundaries when challenged with influences from\nshoegaze, noise and drone. With Betweener EP, he\nmoves slightly toward standard progressive house\nbut sticks firm to his principles. His beats are industrial sounding, muted with filters and interesting.\nOpening with an incredibly beautiful, swelling,\nlo-fi analogue synth, the EP proceeds triumphantly;\nspacey, muted sounds are utilised throughout, phenomenal euphoric highs slowly drift into each other,\nand short breakdowns lead into nuanced, rarely used\nvocal samples.\nTobar yet again manages to produce incredible music that breathes beauty in the bedroom and creates\nfrenzy on the dance floor.\nRoss Gray\nRicardo Tobar\nBetweener EP\n2012\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\nIf any of you have seen the recent contentious\narticle from The New York Times talking about\nhow depraved and culturally rigid London has\nbecome. Thankfully, Soko, whose origins lie in\nFrance, but spends most of her time in California, doesn\u2019t hold such views about our fair\ncapital. You can see from the very first minute\nof her show that playing here, at the Union Chapel in Islington, was a special moment. After\ninterviewing her following the gig she indicated\nthat the venue was \u201cabsolutely perfect, like everything you could ever hope for\u201d and one can\nunderstand why; her dream-like bedroom pop is\nperfectly sited to the intimate, beautiful setting.\nIt was obvious from when she walked on,\nSoko was extremely nervous. The technical\nproblems which plagued the beginning of the\nset only added to any anxiety. I couldn\u2019t really\nconnect with the opening barrage of songs as\nthey stuttered into life. I had been warned by a\nfriend that quality control was something that\nSoko was not famed for, and I have to say that\nI definitely agree. However, her beautiful and\nhaunting lyrics began to draw me in. Lines such\ntimes I felt quite uncomfortable having a singer\nspeak words so painfully honest. She told to me\nthat every other singer who does not perform\nwith such sincerity and fragility are \u201cliars and\nfrauds\u201d.\nWhen leaving the venue I felt a certain sadness that whatever show I went to next, the intensity would not compare with what I had just\nexperienced. Soko totally excelled in the softer\nmoments but I was left thinking if only the set\nwas honed, it would have been a perfect night.\nas \u201creal love is looking at someone sleeping for\nlonger than you can sleep for\u201d as well as the\nmelancholic crys of \u201cI am still looking for my\nfather, so I cannot have a lover now\u201d. Her fragile voice only added to the depth and one could\nalmost reach out and touch the troubles which\nshe was singing about.\nThe highlight of the night was the title track\nof her debut I Thought I Was An Alien. The ever\nrotating backing band excelled on this song\nto bring the chapel to a quasi-religious level\nof worship. It occurred to me that this packed\ncrowd sat in almost total reverence to the waif-like vision that was Soko. They were totally in\nawe, remaining silent, only to erupt in rapturous\napplause after each song.\nThe song which first made me aware of Soko\nwas \u2018First Love Never Die\u2019 which is totally\nawesome and I would recommend it to all of\nyou. She explained that creating all forms of her\nart was like playtime for a child, and that this is\nbest represented by the video for this song, co-directed by her friend Spike Jonze.\nBy the end of the show, Soko was visibly cry-ing. It was easy to see that this gig meant everything to her. However, something I couldn\u2019t\nget to grips with was the lack of setlist which\nmeant that any momentum built up was easily\nlost. It took six years to make her debut, creating a base of 100 songs, but it was easy to feel\nthat a bit more focus would have helped. And\nyet, this is where Soko\u2019s charm lies; the striking\nelven figure who has fleeting moments of beauty interspersed with times of utter madness. At\nSoko at the\nUnion Chapel\nMark England\nKudos to Soko: this hat is hard to pull off\nThomas Leeman\n\n"

Not on\nMY watch!\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking for pre-probing test subjects. If\ninterested, talk to your\ncollege\u2019s test associate\nand he\u2019ll fill you in. As\nwill everyone in the lab\u201d\nH\nello Earth-dwellers, Cave Johnson here.\nFirstly, I\u2019ve got a note from\nthe lab boys over in biochem,\nand they\u2019ve told me to tell you\nnot to eat any of the \u2018Election Special\u2019 range\nfrom the JCR. There\u2019s something scribbled\nhere about \u2018politicitis\u2019, and severe social repul-siveness. This news probably comes too late\nfor most of you, but you can all take comfort\nin the fact that you\u2019re furthering the advance of\nscience by at least a couple of minutes.\nFor the last question of term, Harry asks,\n\u201cIf we meet friendly extraterrestrial life, how\nshould we abuse (sorry, harness) its power? If\nit\u2019s evil, how should we combat it?\u201d\nFirstly, we can be pretty sure that any\naliens who turn up at our doorstep are going\nto be more technologically advanced than us.\nThey\u2019re likely to have ray-guns, teleporters\nand some fancy anti-lemon technology. If they\ncome in peace, then it\u2019s our duty as citizens\nof the United States to keep all of the science\nand advancements to ourselves, and make\ndamn sure it doesn\u2019t fall into the wrong hands.\nLike communists. Or Black Mesa. I\u2019m not sure\nwhich is worse.\nWe know from all the stories that it\u2019s not a\nproper abduction unless there\u2019s some kind of\nprobing. That\u2019s science fact. Our resident xe-nobiologist says that this is because it\u2019s the\nway that most aliens greet each other, and as\nsuch we want to give our visitors the warmest\nwelcome possible. We don\u2019t want to risk damaging the alien bodies through such invasive\nprocedures, so the boys down in biology want\nto get some pre-probing done to minimalize\npotential loss when the time comes. Coincidentally, we\u2019ve got a great testing opportunity\nfor lazy students \u2013 talk to your college\u2019s test\nassociate and he\u2019ll fill you in. As will everyone in the lab. Once we\u2019ve learned everything\nabout their technology, we\u2019ll just be left with\nthe little green men themselves. The aliens \u2013\nnot the leprechauns \u2013 for the UCL-calibre students among you. Keep up.\nThe Journal of Astroxenochembiophilosophical Geological Pseudo-Sciency Materials\nB recently published an article that listed the\nways that aliens may be biologically different\nfrom us. It\u2019s a couple of hundred pages long,\nbut it\u2019s a good read, if your college has access\nto it. It even has pictures. They\u2019ve concluded\nthat the most likely form of any alien invaders is not that of the classic green-skinned\nand beady-eyed variety, but rather short, furry\ncreatures that embody an image of cuteness.\nThat\u2019s how they get close to their prey. For\nthe conspiracy theorists among you, I would\nsuggest printing out a copy to keep on you at\nall times. Don\u2019t worry about the amount of paper required though \u2013 there are too many trees\nanyway. And they\u2019re all watching you. As a\nspecial testing offer to you paranoid students,\nwe\u2019ve created a unique testing experience.\nMonsters TD\nhttp://www.newgrounds.com/portal/\nview/591382\nCrumpled is not a tower defense, but trying to\nclassify it is difficult. It\u2019s part puzzle, part parkour,\npart artsy, part pure imagination. You control both\na wall-climbing man and his fellow\u2019 blob\u2019 of plas-tic, which can morph into shapes and take on new\nproperties.\nCombined, the two must get through the levels,\nactivating switches, blocking damage and providing platforms for one another amongst other\nthings. It\u2019s amazingly creative, and certainly worth\nyour time.\nMonsters TD is a tower defense game. Pretty stan-dard, right? Perhaps, but Monsters TD spins it out\nvery well.\nA strange group of monsters are trying to reach a\nportal, and your only defense is a weird selection of\nfreaky steampunk towers. It starts off pretty basic,\nbut as you advance towers can be upgraded and\nbecome more specialised in their function. Like all\ntower defense games Monsters TD requires a little\ntrial and error and a fair bit of thinking to position\nyour defenses appropriately. Give it a shot.\nFree Web Games\nSorry, nothing remotely funny to say up here this\nweek. I\u2019m suffering from the \u2018flu, and I don\u2019t see\nwhy anyone else should be happy. Check out these\ntwo totally mediocre web games that you can play\nright now in your web browser. In order to suffer\nthorough these you\u2019re going to need the Adobe\nFlash Player plug-in, which can be installed from\nhttp://get.adobe.com/flashplayer/\nCrumpled\nhttp://www.newgrounds.com/portal/\nview/590513\nGet the probulators ready...\nPictured: one puppy, one disguised alien. One will bark and yap, the other will transform\nand vomit boiling space acid down your throat. Choose wisely\nWe\u2019re looking for volunteers to sit in a room\nwith a tin foil hat on. We\u2019ll then bombard you\nwith all the types of radiation we can think off,\nand see what happens. Don\u2019t worry about the\ncancer risk, as we\u2019ll just boil the tumours right\nout of you later. With more radiation.\nBack to business then. If they\u2019re here for\nglobal domination, then I expect that the human populace won\u2019t have much of a chance.\nThe governments will bow down, and you\u2019ll\nall become slaves to your new despotic over-lords. Do not despair, faithful test subjects.\nAperture has a set of guidelines for this exact\nsituation. I don\u2019t know what they are, but I expect it has something to do with the giant lasers\nthat the boys have been making over in weapons testing. There\u2019s supposedly enough energy\nfrom one blast that we can go directly from\n\u2018cow\u2019 to \u2018steak\u2019 in half a second. There is so\nmuch abandoned weapons technology down\nhere that we should start hosting conventions.\nOn the upside, Aperture has enough nuclear\nmaterial to make sure that if I can\u2019t have the\nEarth, neither can they.\nJust as a reminder, I\u2019m going away for a few\nweeks. This is in no way related to the missing\nzoo animals, or my recent attempt at creating\nCave\u2019s Ark. This is just a holiday. A simple underwater holiday. With slugs.\nI\u2019ll leave you in Caroline\u2019s safe hands whilst\nI\u2019m gone.\nGet probed.\nFor science.\n\u201cIn the worst case\nscenario, Aperture has\nenough nuclear material\nto make sure that if I\ncan\u2019t have Earth, neither\ncan they\u201d\n\n"

It\u2019s coming to the\nend of term and just when you\nthought you might look forward\nto a bit of shut-eye, BAM! iCU\nCinema phwacks you in the gut\nwith an All-Nighter. Six films, back-to-back, from the early evening to 6am the\nnext morning, or until the projectionist\ngoes insane and feeds his hair into the\nprojector, whichever comes first.\nOne might reasonably ask, \u201cHow on\nearth does one survive such a test of endurance?\u201d Well, it just so happens that\nI prepared a thorough and completely\nunscientific guide to all those who dare\naccept the iCU Cinema All-Nighter\nchallenge.\nImagine the scenario: it\u2019s around 2am,\nThe Girl with the Dragon Tattoo has\njust finished, and you\u2019re all feeling a bit\nabused, both by the film and by the fact\nthat you\u2019re now three films in. You\u2019re\nbuying a cup of tea when the hot guy\nor girl beside you realises they haven\u2019t\ngot change for a Pot Noodle. Jackpot!\nSwoop in with a couple of 50p coins and\na cool remark about how \u201cthe original\nSwedish version was way better\u201d and,\nhail mary!, you\u2019ve got a duvet buddy.\nNote: if you don\u2019t bring some change,\nthis will never happen and you\u2019ll never\nfind happiness... ever.\nTimetable\n18:00 \u2013 Mission: Impossible\n\u2013 Ghost Protocol\n20:45 \u2013 Sherlock Holmes:\nA Game of Shadows\n23:30 \u2013 The Girl with the\nDragon Tattoo\n02:30 \u2013 Puss in Boots\n04:30 \u2013 Moneyball\n06:00 \u2013 Attack the Block\nTickets are \u00a310 in advance\nat tickets.icucinema.co.uk, or\n\u00a312 on the door. Individual\nfilms are \u00a33 on the door.\nHot and cold food & drinks\nwill be on sale throughout the\nnight. (Including beers, coffee\nand cider!)\nBefore I begin, let me reassure you: it\nis possible. Almost. There are rumours\nthat Chuck Norris made it to the second-to-last film before falling serenly asleep\nin his chair, mumbling something about\n\u201croundhouse kicking Joseph Kony before it was cool\u201d. To give yourself the\nbest chance of making it all the way\nthrough the night, it\u2019s essential that\nyou get a good night\u2019s sleep on Monday. You may have read articles about\nhow the 8-hour sleep is unnatural, and\nyou need two seperate sections of sleep\nwith sex in between (or reading, what-ever). For the All-Nighter you\u2019ll need to\nbe in bed on Monday at 6pm and not\nrise from your comatose slumber until\nTuesday 1:37pm (at the earliest).\nMission: Impossible?\nCoffee is your friend\nOf course, being the independent-mind-ed and strong-willed Imperial students\nthat you are, you may choose to ignore\nmy sleep advice. I would warn you to\nThe girl with the pillow\nHave you ever been to one of those\nfancy cinemas that have sofas instead\nof normal seats? They\u2019re awesome,\naren\u2019t they? A truly luxurious cinematic experience. iCU Cinema is not one\nof those cinemas. More than 12 hours\nsitting on the Union\u2019s standard-issue\nfold-out seats will do ghastly things to\nyour body that would see even the hardiest Medic run for the hills screaming,\n\u201cTHERE IS NO GOD!\u201d Pro-tip: bring\na pillow, bring a duvet; heck, wear pyjamas and bust out those man-uggs you\nkeep pretending you don\u2019t have.\nMoneyballs\nI might as well go ahead and put this out\nthere now: you can pretty much write\noff anything you were planning to do\non Wednesday. That includes: lectures;\nthat super-important meeting with your\nproject supervisor, and that lunch with\nAttack the fry up\nPuss in bed\ndo so at your own peril, and to hell with\nyou, but my colleagues at iCU Cinema\nare more sympathetic. Hot, fresh coffee is piped in from the fields of South\nAmerica via a mind-bendingly long\npipe that looks mysteriously like a jar of\nNescafe, a paper cup, and some scalding hot water... The crack-like caffeine\nis your only weapon against the oblivion of sleep so use it; but use it wisely.\nAh, one other thing \u2013 tea and beer are\nalso on sale. Certainly they are more delicious than coffee, and the beer is likely to make even Puss in Boots a riotous\nlaugh, but help you stay awake until the\nmorning, they do not...\nSo, let\u2019s say we\u2019ve come to the end of\nthe All-Nighter. You\u2019re feeling proud\nof yourself no doubt. Only problem is\nyou\u2019ve got to re-enter the land of the\nliving, and we all know what a terrible,\ndeadline-infested place that can be.\nWhat you really need is an infusion of\ngood, strong, deadly cholesterol. Luckily the SCR does a bang up breakfast.\nOr if you\u2019re feeling really adventurous,\nseek out the Contractors\u2019 Cafe \u2013 just\non the other side of the walkway to the\nQueen\u2019s Lawn. Seek, and ye shall find\naffordable breakfast of the likes ye only\nfind at the Sandwich Shop.\nyour boyfriend/girlfriend that you totally promised to not be late for. The crazy\nshit that summoned the dead from their\ngraves in Dawn of the Dead won\u2019t be\nenough to get you out of bed after the\nAll-Nighter. Your only other option is\nto go hard and just power through with\ncrack-caffeine, because as soon as you\ngo home you\u2019re done.\nIf you\u2019re planning on coming to the iCU\nCinema All-Nighter, tweet @iCU_Cine-ma and let us know how the preparations\nare going.

They have collaborated with Sophie Frankford (violin),\nMidori Jaeger (cello) and Elin Klingfors and\nTxako Jones (backing vocals).\nAnastasia: How did you get the initial motivation to form POCA?\nGeorge: I was probably three years old, when\nI decided to become a singer. After that, it did\nnot take very long to realise, I needed songs to\nsing and a band to play with. I started to write\nsongs when I was thirteen. I came to London\nin September 2010, to become a professional\nmusician. I came to London to find my band.\nAnd now we have POCA.\nA: What kind of music do you usually play\nin your performances?\nG: We play original songs. Sometimes we top\nit off with a nice cover. I don\u2019t like to label the\nmusic we create. I just know what my beliefs\nare. They lay in magic and wonders, in colours\nand dark skies, in moons and stars, in beauty\nand love. That is what I bare in mind everytime\nI write; everytime we jam.\nA: Do you compose music as well?\nG: Yes. That is all I do. Every day gives me another melody to work on. When a new melody\nis starting to make sense, I add lyrics to it or\nvice-versa and take it to the rehearsal. All the\nmagic happens then. We arrange the songs to-gether.\nA: From where do you get your inspira-tions?\nG: I like to walk a lot, seek for inspiration.\nIt manages to find me everytime. The streets,\nthe people, the cafes, the lights, the colors, the\nmoon taking a swim in the Thames - all that\nmakes this vibrant city. These are the reasons\nfor me to write another line. Last week I found\ninspiration in a traffic sign.\nA: I am sure that you lead very busy lives as\nstudents and recent graduates. How many\nhours a week/a day do you spend on rehearsing and performing?\nG: Yes, that is true. We all have to work non-music related jobs to support ourselves and\nthat makes everything a bit more complicated.\nHowever, I really do believe in the saying, that\nIf it is important you will find a way, If not,\nyou will find an excuse. POCA is important.\nWe rehearse when we can. Regulary on Sundays, sometimes for a couple of hours, other\ntimes seven hours.\nA: Tell me all the details of your next per-formance. I believe that many Imperial\nstudents would love to spend a music night\nwith you.\nG: And we would love to share our music with\nmany Imperial students. Our next performance\nis on the 4th of April, at The Comedy bar , in\nPOCA\u2019s poppy atmospheres\nLeicester Square. Watch our space in Facebook for more information closer to the date\n(facebook.com/POCAandthecaptains).\nMeanwhile, we are participating in the Live\nand Unsigned 2012 competition. Our second\nround took place on the 11th of March.\nA: What are your future plans for POCA?\nGe: We have only just completed recording\nour first EP, which will be released very soon.\nIn the meantime we will be performing in venues in and around London and possibly some\nfestivals this summer. We will keep on being\ninspired and writing more music, until there is\nnothing left for us to write.\nSince this interview took place, POCA have\nmade it through to the London semi-finals of\nLive and Unsigned 2012 (congratulations!):\ncheck their Facebook page for details.\nYou can\u2019t read my P-P-P-P-POCA face\nAnastasia Eleftheriou finds even traffic signs can inspire\nRama\u2019s Hip-Hop\nTune of the Week\nIn an attempt to redeem myself for last week\u2019s\npoor no-show this week I\u2019ve upped the ante and\nbringing you a whole mixtape.\nA month ago Drake was the only Canadian\nhip-hop artist I knew of, and judging from a\nquick Wikipedia search my knowledge hasn\u2019t\nexpanded much, however I recently had the\ngood fortune to come across Shad. I love old\nschool hip-hop beats and so it would appear\ndoes Shad, his social awareness and general\nrapping style remind me a lot of Common\u2019s\nolder material, all of which make his music\npretty awesome.\n\u2018Besides\u2019, released in December, is a mix of\nsome of the features he has done over the past\nyears.

We have won 9\nout of 9 ULU games and well placed to win back-to-back titles. Varsity is a big game for us as we\noften train with and compete against the medics\nthroughout the season. No-one can remember\nthe last time the medics won, and we hope to\nkeep it that way.\nVarsity ambition:\nKeep our unbeaten record this season and in\nvarsity history.\nLineup:\nTBC\n2012\u2019s ULU water polo league results may prompt\nsome of you to think IC will dominate at varsity. They\nare sitting at the top of the league table, undefeated\nin weeks. They play their matches, they go to the\npub and they exchange (tall) stories of their dazzling\ntactics.\nBut while they sit jauntily on puffy cushions in the\nHoop and Toy, the Medic Beast has been stirring.\nWe play our matches. Then instead of filling the\nlocal with news off our brilliance, we go straight to\na late night gym and sculpt our abs. We work on our\nswimming and throwing muscle groups so that the\nnext time we\u2019re in the water, we are bigger, better\nand stronger than our opposition.\nAnd it works.

We have been told on\nseveral occasions by both losing and winning\nopponents that they appreciate our fairness\nand positive attitude.\nThe greatest success of the team is that\nwe made it to today\u2019s BUCS Cup Final!

The next\ngame vs. City University will decide which team\nwins the league and gets promoted to a new\ndivision.

We have equaled last year\u2019s\nwin total in ULU despite being severely injury\ndepleted. We also defeated the IC 2nds in ULU\nfor the first time in club history. This is our first\nseason in BUCS, and we currently have two wins,\nwith two more matches to play. Our biggest win\nof the season came in the 2nd round of the BUCS\ncup, when after being down by 20 points at half-time, we came back to beat St. Mary\u2019s University\nCollege by one point!

We\u2019ve suffered an unprecedented\namount of injuries to key players and as a result\nwe\u2019ve failed to put out consistent XIs all season.\nThis has meant building an understanding between\nteam members has been more difficult than usual\nbut the players have still performed with admirable\nspirit and passion throughout the season.\nVarsity is a one-off game and we can use that to\nour advantage. Setbacks during the season can all\nbe forgotten with a win in this fixture. Our penalty\nshoot-out loss last year is still fresh in the memory\nso we\u2019re determined to settle the score in 2012.\nLineup:\nImran Ahmed\nKarim Amer\nIme Eka\nDavid Hillier\nSamuel Horti\nJames Illif\nBradley Lonergan (GK)\nPatrick McGown\nUzoma Nnajiuba\nIfeanyi Onubogu\nYoussuf Saleh\nAdem Uner\nWilliam Tomlinson\nHarold Wilson-Morkeh (C)\nCaptain: Marc Robins\nWe have started the season being the winners of\na dramatic cup final last year and having lost the\nleague title by a point. Our aims for this year were\nto literally win every title we were competing in: ULU\nCup, ULU league and BUCS league. Unfortunately,\nwe did not have the necessary depth in the squad to\nachieve this, so we ended up being in an average position in ULU league. We are chasing the league title\n(and consequently the promotion) in BUCS and are\ncurrently 3 points behind the top team; with 2 games\nto go (including a table-top clash vs Westminster) we\nhave plenty of chances of finishing first.\nMoreover, we managed to make it to the final of\nULU Cup for the third year in a row.\nICFC is definitely a club to be proud of being part\nand all 7 teams are truly a big family.\nOverall, we are 3 wins away of winning an dreamy\ndouble and becoming one of the most successful\nImperial teams ever.\nLineup:\nHenry Gardner (GK)\nTom Fryatt (CB)\nPete Woodhead (CB)\nChristian Nielsen(RB)\nOmar Amjad (RB)\nGavin Graham (RB-LB)\nTheocharis Tofis (LB)\nDominic McMonagle(LB)\nWilliam Wilson (CM)\nJonathan Hill (CM)\nWill Wilson (CM)\nDionigi Benincasa (CM)\nAhmed Cherif (CM)\nConstantinos Zarnas (AM)\nPierre-Luc-Joffre (RW)\nNathan Ferrol (AM)\nJack Robinson (CF)\nJoshua March (CF)\nCaptain: Ajay Mohite Captain: Timothy Beasley\nThe 2011/2012 season has been\nsomewhat of a transitional year for IC\n2nd Football Team. Results have been\nmixed as personnel and tactics have had\nto be adapted at many points throughout\nthe year to cover for injuries and player\nmovement between squads. At the start\nof the season the ambition was to strive\nfor promotion in both our BUCS and ULU\nleagues, and although this has not quite\ncome to fruition, things could have been\nvery different if a few results had gone\nslightly differently along the way.\nHowever, the season can still be seen\nas a relative success. The vast majority of the squad will still be available for\nselection next year, and with a few addi-tions, we should be set up nicely to have\nsuccess in all competitions.\nThe highlights from this year have included victories over both the Medic 1st\nand 2nd teams, and hopefully this run\nwill be continued at Varsity!\nLineup:\nChris Aspinall\nKola Ayanwale\nTim Beasley (C)\nTom Caron\nKume Feese\nJoan Garcia\nDom Lawrance\nKyri Mavrommatis\nJon Mitchell\nPeter Nugent\nOladapo Ogunbiyi\nGus Polisano\nNam Seungkyu\nTom Than\nDan Widdowson\nWill Wright\nMedics Captain: Harry Posner IC Captain: Haran Rajkumar\nThe 4s have had a very successful season with\n11 wins and counting leaving us second in the\nleague with 3 games remaining. Despite this, a\npoor set of results in the middle of the season\nmeans it will be difficult for us to win what would\nbe a third consecutive league title. This season\nhas still seen some fantastic performances and\nthe 7-0 destruction of LSE 5s, will be long re-membered. Freshers Taha Butt, Jack Peacock\nand Myles Jarvis have been stand out performers all season. (The lack of culture/ intellectual\npresence in Reynolds had left Myles disgruntled\nat his former club). After disappointing performances in various cups the 4s will be looking to\nachieve a taste of success in Varsity.\nLineup:\nGiles Mann\nHaran Rajkumar\nJack Peacock\nBilal Abou El Ela\nMarcello Valerio\nPhill Vautier\nMyles Mcgrath\nTaha Butt\nAriff Faisal\nPaolo Strampelli\nBruno Howard\nMyles Jarvis\nFrancis Nwobu\nSander van der Bie\nGeorge Bizell\nIC Captain: Sami Dabbagh\nExpectations at the beginning of the season\nwere muted, with the departure of big names and\neven bigger characters at the back end of last\nseason. Two wins from our opening 2 games away\nat UCL hinted at a promising season. First term\nalso saw us recover from a terrible start in BUCS\nto win 3 games on the trot taking us to the top of\nthe table. A major highlight was beating our own\n2s and also our demolishming of St. Mary\u2019s in the\nBUCS cup. As the season comes to a close, with\ntwo games to go we are still in the mix for promotion in both of our leagues, quite an astonishing feat. And with 2 wins and 2 losses out of 4\nagainst Medic opposition this season, Varsity is\na perfect curtain closer.\nLineup:\nChris Aspinall\nSam Thomas\nSami Dabbagh\nNick Birtle\nEd Lobb\nApos Mourouzis\nDan Moxham\nBilal Nasim\nOli Gaite\nMax de Pauw\nRob Maizonnier\nByung Choi\nFares\nIndy Birdee\nTristan McKee\nMedics Captain: Louis Peters\nThis will be the second year that the 3rd teams of\neach football club have met each other under the\npretence of Varsity - Last years inaugural match was\ndeservedly won in a hard fought game that the medics clinched in the dying minutes. It was a game\nenjoyed by not only the team but also the tens of\nfans on the sideline cheering their support which\nwill hopefully be repeated this year!\nICSMFC 3s have had a highly successful season\nthus far. Having already reached the UH Cup Final\nto be played on Wed 14th March we will hopefully\nbe bringing the team its first piece of silverware for\nmany years. One week later we will hopefully be\nrepeating last years accolades and succeeding in\nconquering our IC rivals.\nLineup:\nGK : Naeem Meghjee\nLB : Louis Peters (c)\nCB : Ed Cairns\nCB : Will Hancox\nRB : George Issit\nCM : Mark Jenkins\nCM : Odhran Keating\nCM : Jawaad Saleem\nCM : James Gilbert\nCM : Jay Cash\nLM : Alex Maini\nRM : Will Ocen\nST : Shaneel Patel\nST : Tobi Oyefesot\nThe 4th team have had an incredible season\nthis year, with a great intake of new freshers\nto bolster the side. The chat has been beyond\nbelief and so has the playing on the pitch. With\na goal tally of unbelievable belief, for the 4s,\nwe have had some great results, but with the\nfirst varsity we hope to extend our streak.

    "content": "FELIX\nFriday 16 march 2012\n24\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nComment Editors: Tim Arbabzadah\nSam Horti\nCOMMENT\nDon\u2019t vote\u2026 yet\nY\nou heard me. Despite\nbeing torn three or more\nways between candidates telling you to vote\nfor them, hold back until you\u2019ve heard what I have to say (as-suming you have a voice in your head\nwhen reading this), or even complete-ly. This article is no more than twelve\nhours from being too late for this year,\nbut should serve well for next year\u2019s\nelections and beyond.\nDemocracy is the best of a truly awful set of government options: for it\nto work properly you need a populace\nthat\u2019s not only impartial and properly\ninformed, but intelligent and humble\nenough to know when their opinion is\ncompletely unwarranted. Yeah, everyone has the right to their opinion, blah\nblah blah. Claiming otherwise would\npaint you as some demon advocate\nagainst free speech. I couldn\u2019t care less\nabout everyone having their own opinion on a topic, but for two things: not\nall of them are sufficiently informed\nand not everyone is capable of dismissing ignorance or propaganda. Either problem by itself would be solved\nby the absence of the other; and solving the latter is a hell of a lot harder, so\nhere\u2019s what you do.\nIf you don\u2019t have any good reason\nto vote, don\u2019t. If you can\u2019t handle telling your friends that you didn\u2019t vote\nthen just lie about it, praying nobody\nhacks the elections to de-anonymise\nthe whole thing. \u201cBut it\u2019s your right\nto vote! All the people who died in\nthe struggle to have your voice heard\nwould be disgraced! If everyone\nstopped voting, we\u2018d have another\nHitler in power!\u201d Sure, prove Godwin\u2019s Law yet again. And sure, all of\nus here have a right to vote. A duty,\nsome might even say. This is where\npeople are wrong. Your duty is to\nmake a vote that matters \u2013 one that is\nbased on a critical review of each of\nthe candidates. So in fact, your real\nresponsibility is to put your brain into\ngear during elections to think properly\nabout how to spend your vote, rather\nthan blindly choosing someone because they hounded you the most over\nTwitter or Facebook. At best, your vote\nis completely random, hence inconse-quential. At worst, you\u2019re favouring a\ncandidate for the wrong reasons at the\nexpense of someone better.\nI will confess that the \u201cproperly informed\u201d pre-requisite is quite hard to\nachieve: not only does a campaigning\nlength of two weeks hardly provide\nsufficient information, but the candidates themselves could be running for\na slew of unfavourable reasons that can\nbe hard to filter out. Not to mention that\nif you\u2019re slick enough with your public relations you can completely hoodwink enough people to win an election.\nImpartiality is trivial in governmental\nelections but called into question when\nthe chances are you might personally\nknow a few of the candidates. In my\nexperience, it\u2019s the people who aren\u2019t\nparticularly enthused by elections that\ntend to say that they\u2019re going vote for\nthe guy they know \u2013 if you\u2019re one of\nthem, just remember that they don\u2019t\nknow if you actually voted, and any\nbrownie points you gain are minimal\nwhen you consider you are just one\namong dozens of friends and potentially thousands of voters. You might\nargue that if one vote is insignificant,\nthen there\u2019s no harm \u2013 which is true\nuntil others start thinking the same.\nIn short, if you think elections are a\npopularity contest, kindly step away\nfrom the booth and into your nearest\nautocratically governed student body.\nThe frenzy surrounding elections\nis sure to dazzle and disorient you (I\nknow I feel like that), but before giving\nin to the rainbow of posters, tweets,\nFacebook updates, human pyramids,\nflyers and free sweets to vote against\nRON, take a step back and think about\nwhether you should even bother.\nVeli Akiner\nM\nost people define a\nmiracle as a supernatural event, inexplicable by the laws\nof science and na-ture. So is it reasonable for a modern,\nrational, Imperial scientist to believe\nin miracles?\nLast week I spent an afternoon wandering around the Blackett lab, asking fellow Physics undergraduates for\ntheir opinion on this. Many simply\nhadn\u2019t considered the question, and\nfreely admitted they didn\u2019t have any\nthoughts on the matter. Others refused\nto answer, perhaps nervous of this\nodd, religious second year interrupting their conversations. However, a\nfew had stronger opinions. One student stated that miracles were impos-sible, another that a belief in miracles\nand a belief in physical laws are in-compatible. Yet another explained\nthat his belief in miracles and his scientific studies were two separate areas\nthat didn\u2019t necessarily contradict one\nanother.\nLet\u2019s conduct a little thought exper-iment. A first year medic bursts from\nthe SAF claiming that a supernatural event has taken place. A cadaver,\njust about to be dissected, suddenly\nopened its eyes, sat up and asked for\na glass of water. As a rational Imperial scientist, you\u2019re naturally scepti-cal, and your friend sitting with you\nlooks incredulous. Your friend immediately exclaims \u201cThat\u2019s complete\nbalderdash!\u201d and continues eating.\nCan a scientist believe in miracles?\nBut you\u2019re not so quick to dismiss\nthe claim. You question the medic a\nlittle further: \u201cAre you certain of what\nyou saw? Have you slept much lately?\nWas anyone else present?\u201d The story\nstill checks out, and you decide to go\nand examine the evidence for your-self. You enter the SAF and immediately see a group of medics laughing\nuproariously. It turns out to have been\nan elaborate RAG Week prank.\nBut who was the better scientist:\nyou or your friend? Despite the fact\nthat your friend was correct, how was\nhe so certain? I would like to suggest\nthat it is unscientific to dismiss miracles without first investigating the\nevidence, even if the claim is outra-geous. Because we all study science\nit can be easy to forget that scientific\nlaws are not infallible. They are simply expectations based on consistent\nobservation and experience.\nNow, as a Christian I certainly believe in miracles. Christianity makes\nno sense if miracles aren\u2019t possible.\nMy entire faith hangs on the miracle\nof Jesus Christ, having been dead\nfor three days, rising from the dead.\nOf course, you\u2019d initially think that\nwas impossible. So did all those who\nclaim to have seen Jesus alive after\nhis death. In the biographies of Jesus\u2019s life, we read of how his own\nfriends took some convincing before\nthey really believed it was him, and\nnot a ghost or some trick of the mind.\nJesus talked to them, touched them,\nand ate with them. Only then did they\nbegin to believe.\nInterestingly, the Bible doesn\u2019t seem\nto make much distinction between\nsupernatural and everyday events. It\nexplains how in God \u201call things hold\ntogether\u201d \u2013 that is, matter would cease\nto exist if God were to stop sustaining it. From this perspective, our very\nexistence is the real miracle. Any socalled \u2018supernatural events\u2019 might be\nunusual, but are just as miraculous as\neverything else.\nThere is one other, huge miracle\nin the Bible. According to Jesus, the\nmost important things in life are to\nlove God with all your heart, soul,\nstrength and mind, and to love your\nneighbour as you love yourself. I\ncan\u2019t answer for everyone, but I know\nthat I, for one, have not met these cri-Personally, I\u2019m getting memories of Bognor Regis\nMy entire faith\nhangs on the\nmiracle of Jesus\nChrist, having been\ndead for three\ndays, rising from\nthe dead\n\u201d\nfrom\nfrom\n\u201c\nMy enti\nMy enti\nh g\nh g\nteria. I\u2019m a long, long way off. But by\nhis death and resurrection Jesus has\nmade it possible for me to have the\nright relationship with God, despite\nall my shortcomings. The miracle is\nthat anyone who has faith in this, no\nmatter who you are or what you\u2019ve\ndone, can look forward to an eternity\nin paradise.\nPerhaps what you\u2019ve read has been\nintriguing, provoking or just plain\noffensive! I\u2019d love you to bring your\nquestions or objections to a series\nof events investigating the resurrection of Jesus next week at Imperial.\nIt\u2019s advertised under \u201cImpossible,\nImprobable, Irrelevant?\u201d To find out\nmore check out www.impossible2012.\norg. I hope to see you there!\nJames Faux\n...if you think\nelections are a\npopularity contest,\nkindly step away\nfrom the booth\naway\nawa\noth\nth\n\u201c\n...if you\n...if you\nelection\nelection\n\n"

    "content": "A powerful hallucinogenic drug once used by\nthe CIA in torture experiments may help alcoholics stop drinking, according to new research.\nThe research, funded by the Research Council\nof Norway and based on experiments conducted\nin the 1960s and 1970s, shows that the psychedelic drug LSD (Lysergic acid diethylamide)\ncan have \u201ca significant beneficial effect on alcohol misuse.\u201d\nIt fails to show how LSD works in alcoholics,\nbut doctors who have seen the research say that\nLSD causes the human brain to function more\n\u201cchaotically\u201d, inspiring alcoholics to give up\ntheir dependency on booze. Robin Carhart-Harris, a psycho-pharmacologist at Imperial told\nNature, \u201cPsychedelics probably work in addiction by making the brain function more chaotically for a period \u2013 a bit like shaking up a snow\nglobe \u2013 weakening reinforced brain connections\nand dynamics.\u201d\nOnce the dust settles, many people who take\nLSD say that their problems appear clearer and\nsimpler, allowing them to make a strong resolution to stop drinking.\nLSD was introduced on to the market in 1947\nas a psychiatric drug and was used by some doctors to treat alcoholics. Several trials conducted\nin the decades that followed the drugs release\nall showed positive benefits on alcoholics. But,\ntaken individually, these trials were too small\nfor researchers to draw any scientific conclusions from.\nSo Teri Krebs and Pal-Orjan Johansen, researchers at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology, decided to pool together\ndata from six clinical trials conducted in the late\n1960s and early 1970s. They found that a single\ndose of LSD leads to a \u201cdecrease in alcohol misuse\u201d.\nIn the pooled analysis, there were a total of\n536 participants, mainly men who had sought\ntreatment for alcoholism and who were subsequently admitted for in-patient treatment.\nThe alcoholics were given either a dose of\nLSD or a placebo at random.\nOf those who took LSD, nearly 60% stopped\ndrinking. In comparison, only 38% of patients\nwho were given a placebo stopped drinking.\nBut the beneficial effects of LSD faded after one\nyear, the research suggested.\n\u201cGiven the evidence for a beneficial effect of\nLSD on alcoholism, it is puzzling why this treatment approach has been largely overlooked\u201d,\nthe Norwegian researchers said.\nLSD, a class A drug in the UK, is the most\nLSD may help alcoholics\npowerful hallucinogenic drug known. People\nwho use it report a wide range of intense physi-cal, sensory and psychological effects. These\npsychological effects, known as a \u2018trip\u2019, may\nbe pleasant or unpleasant, and can induce profound short and long-term effects on the mental state of those who take it.\nThe idea of psychedelics shocking the mind\nand altering one\u2019s perceptions so that new\nthoughts can be planted is not new or unique\nto psychotherapy. The English poet William\nBlake wrote that \u201cif the doors of perception\nwere cleansed, everything would appear as it\nis, infinite\u201d.\nHumans have used natural psychedelics for\nthousands of years for religious sacrament.\nLSD was used in the 1950s and 1960s by beat\npoets like Allen Ginsberg to spark creativity\nand by politicians who thought LSD could help\nbring about world peace. Even the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) used LSD to try and\ncontrol people\u2019s minds in their human experimentation program known as MKULTRA.\nThe findings from the Norwegian study\nshow that the use of LSD in treating alcoholics\nis just as good as any other treatment we have,\nif not better.\nProfessor David Nutt, from Imperial College, summed it up well to the BBC: \u201cCuring\nalcohol dependency requires huge changes in\nthe way you see yourself. That\u2019s what LSD\ndoes. Overall, there is a big effect. Show me\nanother treatment with results as good; we\u2019ve\nmissed a trick here. This is probably as good as\nanything we\u2019ve got.\u201d\nDOI: 10.1177/0269881112439253\nHoney bee scouts are at the forefront of bee\nexploration, seeking out new sources of food\nfor the hungry hive and finding suitable nest\nsites for the colony when it outgrows its current home. These bees differ from their fellow\nforagers. They do not wait to be told where to\ngo or what to do, but seek novelty, maybe even\nadventure.\nA new study, published in Science, has examined the brains of honey bee scouts and\nfound that this novelty-seeking behaviour\nappears to be based on the same molecular\npathways used in similar thrill-seeking human\nbehaviour.\nNovelty-seeking behaviour in vertebrates\ninvolves catecholamine, glutamate and gam-ma-aminobutyric (GABA) signalling in the\nbrain. The differences in thrill-seeking behaviour between individuals are often attributed\nto personality differences. So do insects like\nhoney bees have personalities of their own,\njust as we humans do?\nThe researchers, led by Gene Robinson and\nZhengzheng Liang, compared the molecular\nunderpinnings of novelty-seeking behaviour\nin bees that do and do not scout. The bees in\nthe colony under scrutiny were fed from a jar\nof sugar water with a yellow flower pattern\nand faint scent for a few days. On three consecutive days an alternative jar with a different\ncolour and a different scent was placed in the\nhive\u2019s vicinity. Bees that visited at least two\nnew jars were defined as scouts and marked by\nLiang, for later capture.\nMicroarray analysis was performed on the\nbrains of these scouts, and on the brains of\nnon-scouting bees, to determine the activity\npatterns of genes in each. Among the thousands of differences in gene activity that the\nresearchers found between scouting and non-scouting bees \u2013 around 16% of 7500 genes in\ntotal showed a significant difference \u2013 several\nwere related to the signalling pathways implicated in vertebrate novelty-seeking, including\nreceptors for the neurotransmitters glutamate\nand dopamine.\nAs both scouts and non-scouts forage for\nfood, Robinson and his colleagues were surprised by the magnitude of differentially expressed genes between the two. In order to\ndetermine whether changes in brain signalling\ncaused novelty-seeking behaviour in the bees,\nthey were exposed to different treatments that\nwould activate or inhibit the neurochemical\nreceptors involved in the signalling paths implicated in vertebrate thrill-seeking.\nThe researchers found that octopamine and\nglutamate treatments increased the likelihood\nof scouting behaviour in bees that had not\npreviously shown novelty-seeking behaviour.\nBees that were fed chemicals that blocked dopamine receptors were less likely to exhibit\nscouting behaviour.\nSince honey bees and humans are not\nclosely related, novelty-seeking behaviour has\npresumably evolved independently in each\nlineage. But the results suggest that insects,\nhumans and other animals share a \u201ctoolkit\u201d of\ngenes that plays a role in this type of thrill-seeking behaviour. This kit has been adapted\nfor use in each species, but it still contains the\nsame components. Perhaps the pioneers of our\nworld, be they human astronauts or honey bee\nscouts, are not so different after all.\nDOI: 10.1126/science.1213962\nFiona Hartley\nFELIX\nFriday 16 March 2012\n14\nscience.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nScience Editors: Kelly Oakes\nAlexander Karapetian\nSCIENCE\nIn brief\nZara Shubber\nScientists at Imperial College have discovered\nthat efficiency savings of up to 80% in the production of biofuel can be made by lubricating the\nwood biomass.\nBiofuels are used widely in Brazil, where all light\nvehicles run on ethanol or a 25% ethanol in gasoline blend, and the USA where gasoline with 10%\nethanol content is widely available. Wood chips\nfrom fast-growing trees such as pine are used to\nproduce cellulosic ethanol as well as biodiesel.\nThe first stage in this process, which often happens at the logging site, is the grinding of wood\nchips into even smaller particles to increase their\nsurface area and thus their reaction and dissolution\nstates. After this, the biomass is treated with ionic\nliquids as a solvent for the cellulose and lignin.\nThe researchers, led by Dr. Agnieszka Brandt of\nthe Department of Chemistry, studied the effects\nof treating the wood before the grinding process.\nThey found that a short impregnation with ionic\nfluids increased the energy efficiency of the grinding process by up to 80% depending on the fluid\nused. A short impregnation time was found to be\nnecessary as the fluid is acting not as a solvent,\nchanging the chemical properties of the wood, but\nas a lubricant for grinding. The findings were published in the journal Green Chemistry.\nBrandt says: \u201cTree wood is a mine of really valuable chemicals locked up in a safe that we need\nto unlock before we can use the different com-ponents. Breaking down the timber into a fine\npowder helps us to access these chemicals, but it\nneeds to be an energy-efficient process to make\nit sustainable. Our previous work showed how the\nchemical action of ionic solvents improved energy\nefficiency in the processing, but we were surprised\nto discover how much more energy could be saved\nwhen take advantage of their lubricating physical\nproperties.\u201d\nThese energy savings could reduce the per-litre\nprice of ethanol fuel by 10%.\nDOI: 10.1039/C2GC15663F\nKeir Little\nLubricated wood grinds better\nHoney bees seek thrills just like us\nPine trees are used to produce biofuels\n\u201c\nWe\u2019ve missed a\ntrick here. This is\nprobably as good\nas anything we\u2019ve\ngot\n\u201d\nhing we\u2019ve\nhing we\u2019ve\nOn his way back from an adventure\n\n"

Are you approaching it differently as captain?\nFirst year I watched from the bench as\nwe missed a great chance to win, having\nbroken my clavicle earlier in the season\nI wasn\u2019t ready to start again. Second\nand third year were similar, disappointing experiences where we didn\u2019t make\nthe most of our chances. Nothing really\nchanges too much as captain, just have\nto be aware of the team\u2019s strategy as\nwell as your own individual role on the\npitch.\nHave you been able to evaluate the\nopposing team\u2019s level, given that\nyou\u2019ve only played once this year?\nWe played the Medics in the BUCS\ncup back in November. Despite not\nperforming too well we won 18-10. I\u2019m\nsure they have come a fair distance since\nthen though, and we certainly have.\nIts fair to say they\u2019ve had a really poor\nseason but maybe they can pick it up for\nthis one off.\nWhat are your thoughts on playing at\nthe Stoop? Sport Imperial have pulled\nout all the stops to get people to\ncome to the game this year;\nhow important is it to have\nstrong support?\nIts great to play at The\nStoop, knowing guys like\nCare, Monye & Easter play\nthere week in week\nout.

It will certainly be a late night\nif things go our way that\u2019s for sure!\nThere was a lot of basking in the glory\nof promotion last week, I\u2019m sure we\ncould manage it again.\nIC CAPTAIN:\nCHARLIE ESBERGER\nA word from the\nclub captains\nThis season has not been an easy one for the medics. The medic timetable and a number of long term injuries have led to a disrupted and\nat times frustrating season in the BUCS premiership. The competition\nhas at times proved a little too difficult. When playing universities that\noffer sports science degrees we are sometimes left a little short of\nresources.\nThat said a number of encouraging performances have been strung\ntogether and a lot of younger players have really come through the ranks.\nOur Saturday side is doing well in London North West 2, sometimes\nplaying against semi-professional outfits. We have qualified for the final\nof the United Hospitals Cup this fixture is being played on the 16th of\nMarch. This is the oldest rugby competition in the world and we are hoping to win the cup for the 9th time in 10 years.\nIn true medic form, despite what some may see as a disappointing\nseason, we appear to be reaching a crescendo in time for varsity. Bring\nit on.\nICURFC have had a successful season, with a strong contingent of fresh-ers, a number of whom will be playing tonight. They have bedded into the\nClub well and have pushed a number of senior players. The 1st XV are\nlooking for promotion and had a successful cup run including victory over\nImperial Medicals. This has been the only College v Medicals fixture as\nthe teams compete in different leagues. It promises to be a great match\nwith both sides expecting victory!\nLooking forward, ICURFC are excited to be touring North America this\nsummer. Playing a number of top American Universities including MIT,\nHarvard, Princeton and Columbia, the Club is pushing the boundaries of\nsport at Imperial. Players will, I am sure, be a credit to the University and\nthe Club.\nI would like to wish both teams the best of luck and to thank ICURFC\nsponsors Accenture, Citi and Find Invest Grow for their continued support\nand look forward to hearing \u2018Sylvia\u2019 reverberating around the stadium\nafter the final whistle.\nJPR WILLIAMS MATCH\nRUGBY: THE JPR WILLIAMS MATCH\nToby Spittle\nICURFC Club Captain\nJoseph Pick\nICSM RFC Club Captain\nTeam L\nReserves\nICURFC:\n16.

    "content": "In Brief\nSexism forum held at Union\nA forum on sexism at Imperial College was held on\nTuesday, with the intention of investigating the extent of sexism within the college as well as brainstorming plans on how best to address it.\nEarlier this term, a proposal to create a feminist\nsociety was submitted to the New Clubs Committee, who rejected it on the grounds that it would\nlargely fill the same role as Women in Science,\nEngineering and Technology.\nIn light of this and other recent issues, Deputy\nPresident (Welfare) Nicolas Massie held a forum\nfor a general discussion. It involved short talks\nfrom the Equality and Diversity Unit as well as\ngroup discussions to answer questions, such as\nthose regarding the role of the Gender Equality Officer (a position few people know exists), the need\nfor and specific aims of a feminists\u2019 society, and if\nthere is sexism and barriers to success for women\nat Imperial.\nThe forum concluded that that a society should\nbe founded with the aims of raising awareness,\nproviding a safe space where people who have\nbeen mistreated can go for help, and outreach \u2013\npromoting gender equality both at Imperial and in\nschools and the wider community. Further details\nwill be provided when available.\nKeir Little\nFEATURE\n4\nImperial take on BP Grand Final\nFollowing the Regional Semi-Finals last month, two\nteams from Imperial College have made it to the\nBP Ultimate Field Trip Grand Final. The Grand Final\nwill take place in the Royal Institute on 8 May. Imperial teams make up two of the three teams competing to win the prize of a 6-8 week internship in\nTrinidad and Tobago in the Gulf of Mexico.\nThe first Imperial team to reach the final is CLess, which is made up of three third year Mechanical Engineering students: Zie Wearn Chua,\nZhi Xiong Chong, and Wern Chia Chang. The other\nteam is Global Intelligence Consulting which is\ncomprised of Dun Xiang Ang, Nicholas Kwok, and\nZhen Xiong Lim who are all in their third year of\nMEng Chemical Engineering.\nGlobal Intelligence Consulting spoke about their\nwin with Felix: \u201cWe are very excited to be in the\nfinals! The BP challenge provided a realistic platform for us to put what we had learnt in Chemical\nEngineering into use and we are really proud that\nwe had gone this far in the competition. We really\nhave to credit our success to the rigours of Chem\nEng [\u2026] as well as the support provided by our\nlecturers. The final will be tough as it clashes with\nfinal exams, nevertheless we will try our best and\ndo Imperial proud!\u201d\nAemun Reza\nNicolas: Can you tell me little bit about\nyourself?\nPhillippa: I\u2019m senior research fellow at the\ncentre for appearance research at UWE and\nI\u2019m a research psychologist who specialises\nin body image and eating disorder prevention.\nN: Tell me about the type of research that\nyou do.\nI do a range of applied research. It\u2019s all about\nresearch which aims to have a meaningful\nchange rather than research for research\u2019s sake.\nI do a lot of different projects. At the moment\nprimarily my research is focusing on evaluating body image and eating disorder prevention\nprogrammes in school and in universities, one\nof which is the SUCCEED body image pro-gramme. And I also do a lot of work looking\nat the impact of media images and advertising\non people\u2019s body image and a lot of advocacy\nwork as well. I am heavily involved with the\nCampaign for Body Confidence, a campaign\nset up by two liberal democrat MPs, bringing\ntogether involved stakeholders to speak in the\nCommons every couple of months.\nN: Can you tell me a bit more about your\nwork with the SUCCEED foundation spe-cifically?\nP: I\u2019m the head of research for the SUCCEED\nBody mage programme, which is an evidence\nbased eating disorder prevention programme\nthat originated in the US around ten years ago\nand was hugely successful in sororities. There\nare now over eight years of evidence showing\nsuccess at improving body image and reducing risk factors for eating disorders. It has been\nbrought over to the UK and we are in the process of rolling it out across UK universities,\nevaluating how effective it is at preventing\neating disorders and improving body image. It\nfocuses on women at universities and is a two\nsession interactive programme. The great thing\nabout it is that university students are trained to\nthen deliver the programme to other university\nstudents.\nN: Do you have any figures on how effective\nit is compared to traditional therapies?\nP: Not at this stage in the UK but there is US\ndata that shows it is more effective than alternative interventions.\nN: I understand that you are going to be giving a talk at Imperial in two weeks \u2013 what\nwould you hope to achieve?\nP: The talk is part of a campaign. The aim of\nthis campaign is to raise awareness of body\nimage and eating disorders, with a particular\nfocus on body image and how it\u2019s an issue that\nimpacts upon almost everyone and can affect\npeople across all key areas of living including\npsychological and physical health but also social relationships, and how well people achieve\nin academic stetting. It\u2019s also to discuss social\nand cultural influences that affect the way we\nfeel about how we look and some key tips on\nevidence base and a good success rate in the\nUnited States with improving body image\namong young women. What individuals can\ndo is focus on what they like about their bod-ies, including what it looks like, but also what\ntheir bodies can do for them, trying to appreciate the function of their bodies as well as the\nway they look.\nN: When should someone consider one of\nthese programmes?\nP: This is a varied answer and it depends on\nwho you talk to. Taking part of the SUCCEED\nbody programme has been shown to improve\npeople\u2019s body image as well as their mood.\nFrom my perspective I would obviously recommend that everyone take part in the SUCCEED programme, especially considering\nthat over 75% of people are unhappy with the\nway they look according to the figures that\nwe see in the research. I don\u2019t think there is\na critical point anyone needs to reach before\nthey take part in something like that.\nN: Would you say that there is a continuum\nfrom body image issues to eating disorders\nand body dysmorphic disorder (BDD)?\nWould you say that they are connected?\nP: They are connected but I wouldn\u2019t say there\nis a continuum. Eating disorders and BDD are\nvery complex illnesses that are determined by\na range of factors, biological, social and psy-chological. Body image issues are a risk factor\nfor certain types of eating disorders but are not\nthe cause. It\u2019s a lot more complex than that.\nNot everybody who has body image concerns\nwill go on to develop an eating disorder and\nhow people can improve their body image.\nN: A lot of people spend a great deal of time\nthinking about their bodies, what they eat,\ntheir exercise regime. Can you tell me when\nthis sort of fixation becomes a problem?\nP: I think it becomes a problem when it starts\nto heavily influence how somebody sees themselves and judge their value. If you spend so\nmuch time working out in the gym that you\ncan\u2019t finish your university assignments, or\nhave a happy, healthy social life, then that becomes a problem.\nN: You said \u2018if you can\u2019t live a happy,\nhealthy social life\u2019 it becomes a problem.\nWould you say it becomes a mental health\nproblem?\nP: Anorexia and bulimia are diagnosable mental health conditions. Body image concerns\nare when people negatively evaluate how they\nfeel about their own bodies and their appear-ance, whether that\u2019s how they look or how\nthey function. That\u2019s not a clinical disorder\nbut there is lots of research over the past twenty years that shows that negative body image\nis a significant risk factor for anxiety and de-pression, and for unhealthy relationships with\nfood and exercise.\nN: You said it isn\u2019t a medical condition but\nare there any sorts of treatments or strategies that those who want to improve their\nbody image could employ?\nP: There are lots of effective programmes out\nthere, one of which is the SUCCEED body\nimage programme which has a very strong\nfeatures.felix@gmail.com\nFeatures Editors: Katy Bettany\nStephen Smith\nFELIX\nFriday 16 MARCH 2012\nAll about body image\nDr. Phillippa Diedrichs, an expert in Body Image, gives a talk next week at Imperial.

Are you approaching\nit differently as captain?\nIt\u2019s always been a great match\nto be involved in from\ncoming on in extra time\nas a fresher to captaining\nthe side last year at the\nStoop. Getting MoM in\n2nd year is a personal highlight. It\u2019s my\nsecond year as captain and I don\u2019t think\nit makes that much difference really; it\u2019s\nfairly easy to get the boys pumped up for\nmatches like Varsity.\nHave you been able to evaluate the\nopposing team\u2019s level, given that you\nhaven\u2019t played each other this year?\nWe played them in the cup a while back so\nwe\u2019ve seen a little of each other. The College are obviously coming in off the back\noff a promotion season from the league\nbelow but we\u2019ve been in this position before and I think the Varsity match really\nis a one-off game, which is probably\nwhy it\u2019s such a close affair every year.\nHow often do your course commitments clash with rugby ones? What\nwins out in the end?\nWith two games and two training sessions a week rugby takes up a lot of\ntime but usually people are pretty\nunderstanding so I always put\nrugby first during the season.\nWhat are your thoughts on\nplaying at the Stoop?\nSport Imperial have\npulled out all the stops\nto get people to come to\nthe game this year; how\nimportant is it to have\nstrong support?\nIt\u2019s not a bad pitch. Don\u2019t think it\u2019s a\ntouch on our home ground at Teddington but suppose it will have to do. It\nwas a brilliant atmosphere down at the\nStoop last year and it\u2019s always amazing\nto have the support of the Med school\ndown at the game, I think it makes\neverybody raise their game.\nDo you pay attention to the other\nVarsity results, or is it all about the\nRubgy?\nDefinitely. We only really get to watch\nthe other rugby matches and some of\nthe Hockey and Football down at Harlington. Supporting your mates in the\nother sports gets everyone a bit fired up\nfor the game in the evening.\nSpeaking of Rugby; was England\u2019s\nvictory against France a one-off or\ndo you think things are moving in the\nright direction after the World Cup?\nThey\u2019re a pretty inexperienced side at\ninternational level at the moment but the\ngames against Wales and France have\ndefinitely been an improvement on the\nhorrible performances during the World\nCup. Think they\u2019re probably going to\nget better and better as a side the more\nthey play together.\nHow would you convince the average\nImperial student to go and watch\nVarsity?\nI think there\u2019s still quite a lot of Med\nschool pride and spirit around so don\u2019t\nthink it should be too much of a hard\nsell. Even if you don\u2019t particularly like\nrugby it\u2019s an entertaining night out\nwith your mates and the atmosphere is\nalways great.\nFinally, what are your post-match cel-ebration/commiseration plans?\nSame old nonsense at the Reynolds as\nevery Wednesday\u2026 ideally not ending\nup as a double page spread in a national\nnewspaper the following week.\nVARSITY WILL\nTAKE PLACE ON\nWEDNESDAY 21\nMARCH\nRUGBY 2NDS MATCH\nICSM CAPTAIN:\nJONNY FISHER-BLACK\nLineups\nThe 2s this year have had an up and down sea-son. After a disappointing start against teams that\nwent on to top the league, our season was back on\ntrack with back to back wins in the run up to Christmas lifting us up the table. After Christmas we had\na series of narrow losses, losing two games by a\ntotal margin of 3 points, both after being in winning\npositions.\nHowever we recovered from these with two more\nwins to hopefully secure survival in the league whilst\nplaying some very attractive rugby. This team is a\nyoung team and has grown in confidence and ability\nthroughout the season leaving us in a strong position for Varsity and the future.\nCaptain: Matthew Poynton\nLineup:\n1.

    "content": "A note from the Editors\nW\nhen Mark Pincus founded\nZynga (named \u2018Presidio\nStudios\u2019 at the time) in\nApril 2007, only a small\nproportion of the relatively\nfledgling Facebook user base were aware of the\ntransformative impact \u2018social\u2019 would have on\ntheir digital lives. Even less appreciated was its\napplication to online gaming, a pastime thought\nto be the reserve of a generally derided stereo-type. But last year Zynga accounted for 12%\nof Facebook\u2019s total revenue, and a quick look\nat the monthly active user (MAU) rankings for\nFacebook apps places Zynga way out in the\nlead with 240 million, six times the figure for\nsecond place. So where did this company come\nfrom, and what are its plans for you?\nA company founded five years ago next\nmonth naturally hasn\u2019t had a lot of time to generate much of a \u2018history\u2019. Mark Pincus (age 46)\non the other hand, has. After getting his MBA\nfrom Harvard, he started the technology company Freeloader with a $250k loan in 1995.\nSeven months later he\u2019d sold the business for\n$38 million, announcing himself as a player in\nthe evolution of the web 1.0. However, not everything Pincus touched turned to gold.Among\nhis failures can be counted tribe.net, a social\nnetwork he started at age 37 that never took off.\nBut the big break came when, in 2007, along\nwith friend and technology investment powerhouse Reid Hoffman, he invested in the social\nsapling Facebook.com. This put Pincus on a\ncollision course with Mark Zuckerberg (Face-book co-founder) and at the heart of the social\nrevolution that would, not uncontroversially,\ntransform all of our digital lives irreversibly.\nIn his five years at the helm of Zynga, Pincus\nhas played the role of the quiet revolutionary.\nMark Zuckerberg has had his own Hollywood\nfilm made in his (arguably \u2018dis\u2019) honour while\nthe late Steve Jobs (Apple co-founder and\nCEO) was never one to hold back praise of his\nown products. Through all this, Pincus focused\non the quality of his products at the expense\nof his public profile. This approach paid divi-dends. When Zynga released its first product\nin July 2007, (a poker game for Facebook us-ers) it ushered in a new age of free high quality\ngames. Before Poker Blitz (since replaced by\nTexas HoldEm Poker), free online games were\nmore often associated with poor Java applets\non addictinggames.com, miniclip.com and the\nlike. Zynga were the first to change all this. In\ncomparison with Apple\u2019s iOS app store, today\u2019s most ready supplier of free digital games,\nPoker Blitz was launched almost a year earlier.\nZynga has never stopped growing. Attracting\nan investment of $29m early on in its life and\nrecruiting big names from the gaming industry\n(notably Bing Gordon, former Chief Creative\nOfficer of EA) propelled it to produce hits\nsuch as FarmVille, CityVille and Words with\nFriends, to name but three. Expanding across\nGoogle+, Myspace and Yahoo! and generating\nenormous valuations year on year culminated\nin the company going public in December\n2011, following a $10bn valuation in April\nof the same year. However, this action forced\nZynga\u2019s hand, revealing a lot of information about the company that had been closely\nguarded up until that point. For instance, only\n2.5 per cent of its users paid for virtual in-game\ngoods. This was enlightening to other players\nWhat is Zynga up to now?\nFELIX\nFriday 16 march 2012\n16\ntechnology.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nTechnology Editors: Chris Bowers\nFeroz Salam\nTECHNOLOGY\nof companies who could, and do, offer what\nZynga currently provide, and Facebook has no\nqualms about tapping that resource. At present\nfor Zynga, there\u2019s only one worthwhile social\nplatform, but while they dominate that market,\nthey can only grow in tandem with Zuckerberg\nand co\u2019s gaming user base.\nBut has all that just changed? On 1 March,\n2012, an overhaul of Zynga.com \u2013 first announced five months earlier \u2013 finally arrived,\nintroducing the \u2018Zynga platform\u2019. The press\nrelease describes this as a \u201cnew platform designed to bring players what they\u2019ve asked\nfor: new ways to play and more people to play\nwith\u201d. This in no way severs Zynga\u2019s strong\nand valuable Facebook ties. What it does offer\nis a route to Zynga\u2019s vast community of online\ngamers, without the Facebook intermediary.\nIt also boasts enhanced connectivity and user\ninteraction within games, and with what could\neffectively become a quasi-newsfeed dedicated to your gaming-sphere, you can quickly\nsee how broad and future-proof a move this is\non Zynga\u2019s part. It deftly sidesteps a five year\ntie-in deal with Facebook (signed in 2010), for\nwhich most of the details are withheld, while\nat the same time tapping into a 800 million\nstrong user base it has invested little effort in\ncultivating.\nSo now we play the waiting game. Zynga\u2019s\ncontinued success will rely on it building an attractive social environment tuned as much to\nits users as to its games, accessible through mobile and desktop. Much akin to Apple\u2019s success\nin building a digital ecosystem where hardware\nand software are seamlessly integrated, Zynga\nmust look to blur the line between social and\ngaming. By drawing in customers on these two\nfronts, it can create a product not only for the\navid gamer, but for the masses. This must be its\nnext step in expanding the portion of its user\nbase driving revenue. Regardless of their success up until now, just as EA, Activision, and\nBlizzard missed the boat on social gaming 1.0,\nZynga could well lose the race to dominate second time round. However, with their announcements this month, they don\u2019t look to be going\nanywhere just yet.\nApple: reviewing our reviews\nTwo weeks ago, on this very page, Feroz reviewed\nthe latest Macbook Air. The review itself was fair,\nbalanced and overall very positive about the lap-top. However, this has been tarnished somewhat\nby the hoops we had to jump through just to get the\nreview out to print. The article itself had been written and finished three weeks prior to publication,\nbut we couldn\u2019t print it until two Apple employees\nhad read through and approved the review. Their\napproval was based on the criterion of there being nothing overtly critical said about Apple or the\nproduct itself. That is stifling.\nAs the review was generally positive, we passed\nthrough this process, albeit not swiftly. Thankfully, no change was required - the words you read\nwere 100% Feroz\u2019s. Principally though, that\u2019s not\nthe point. What would have happened had the review been more critical? It feels like we are being\npressured to write a glowing review \u2013 more like an\nadvert than a critique \u2013 just to be able to get it in\nthese pages.\nPerhaps you think this sounds unfair \u2013 after all,\nApple did provide us with the laptop, trusting us\nwith equipment it values at over \u00a31,000. You don\u2019t\nneed us to tell you that Apple is a popular company \u2013 it\u2019s going to have students buying its products\nleft, right and centre; it doesn\u2019t necessarily need\nour publicity. Based on this, what right do we have\nto criticise its goods?\nThis isn\u2019t how we see it though \u2013 and nor do\nother companies: we haven\u2019t had our work pass\nthrough pre-publication scrutiny from other hardware manufacturers. We feel that companies\nshould be confident enough in their products to\nrun the \u2018risk\u2019 of a bad review. Should a company\nfear negativity from a newspaper article, perhaps\nit should proactively improve the product; pour its\nheart and soul into the project so it\u2019s as good as it\ncan be. The popularity of the Apple brand however,\nwould suggest this has already been done, and\nthat it doesn\u2019t need to fret over student journal-ism.\nDon\u2019t get us wrong \u2013 we fully respect and welcome any company\u2019s right to respond. That is,\nshould we print an article or review that the involved company feels is unfair or inaccurate, and\ncan factually prove as such, we would be happy\nto retract our comments. We strive in this section\nto bring you accurate and interesting journalism \u2013\nwe have no desire to slate a company or product\nbased on preconceptions.\nIt seems to us then, that Apple has taken this\na step too far. It is a very brand-conscious com-pany, so it seems fair that it wants to protect that\nbrand image. However, we feel there needs to be\nsome trust in a situation such as this \u2013 there\u2019s\na fine line between making sure people don\u2019t attack your brand unprovoked and dictating peoples\u2019\nopinions. Unfortunately, we feel this particular example falls on the wrong side of the line.\nJoshua Maxey looks at the past and present of Zynga\nin the industry who saw a chink in Zynga\u2019s\narmour. Away from all the preposterous MAU\nfigures, there was only a small proportion of\nthe gaming community bringing Zynga its\nrevenue. Overcoming Zynga\u2019s near monopoly\nswiftly became a mission to win round a portion of the user base who valued game quality\nover loyalty. And with details of Facebook\u2019s\nnear-preferential treatment of Zynga coming\nto light at the same time, competitors were not\nshort of motives to topple the social gaming giant either.\nCue Zynga\u2019s next big move. Having firmly\nestablished itself as the industry\u2019s game changer (pardon the pun), it is now on a mission to\nbecome for gaming what Google is to search,\nand Facebook to social. In 2007 Pincus joked\nthat Zynga \u201c[are] a fly on Facebook\u2019s ass\u201d. It\u2019s\ncertainly true that while Zynga brought in a\nlot of revenue for the social network last year\n(around $445m), but to really innovate, at some\npoint it must fly the nest. There is a plethora\n\u201c[Zynga is] now on a\nmission to become for\ngaming what Google is\nto search\u201c\nZynga are responsible for many of the most popular games on Facebook\n\n"

With the high costs\nof college placements and the low number of apprenticeships and jobs on offer\nyoung students are facing an increasingly\ncomplex financial world with fewer and\nfewer opportunities available. Socially\ndisadvantaged youth are particularly af-fected, thereby perpetuating a vicious\ncircle of poverty and social exclusion. It\nhas become all too apparent that young\nstudents today are rarely given the chance\nto learn about business and finance thus\nshrinking a potentially lucrative avenue\nof opportunity. Insight Into Business is a\nproject dedicated to providing the knowledge and skills necessary to allow young\nstudents to create their own success.\nIt has been said that an individual becomes an entrepreneur through the experience of actually going out and trying\nto start a business. Through a number of\nspecially designed and highly interactive\nworkshops we provide the fundamental knowledge and experience necessary\nto encourage students to become more\nentrepreneurial and give them the confidence to go out into the world and start a\nbusiness of their own.\nThe program runs every year throughout the autumn term. Our workshops are\ntypically divided into three sessions that\nare delivered on a weekly basis. Each session aims to provide an overview of a key\nfundamental aspect of the business development process.\nEach year the program culminates in\na competition in which teams from each\nschool are set a business related task and\nthen come to Imperial to compete.

We are currently working with organisations such\nas STEMNET to promote IIB and attract\nmany more schools into the program.\nIn order to facilitate the higher number\nof schools we will naturally need a larger\nteam. We at IIB are currently looking for\npassionate and committed individuals\nwho are looking to get really involved in\na worthwhile project.\nAll the work we do is London based so\nthis is the perfect opportunity for anyone\nwho is looking for community/ volunteer\nwork. Also, for anyone thinking of joining the CV2012 award scheme next year,\nthis will count towards your mandatory\nthirty hours. This is also naturally a perfect opportunity for anyone who is looking to improve their teaching skills.\nThere are a number of new initiatives\nwe are looking to implement for this\ncoming year to ensure the program runs\nsmoothly.\nA new hierarchy system will be introduced with a larger number of roles of\nresponsibility being created. This will allow the more experienced IIB members\nto provide support to new members more\neffectively and ensure a smooth transition\nwhen the program is handed down each\nyear.\nThis is also a great opportunity for anyone looking to enhance their CV.

Industryspecific mentors provide guidance on\nclearing the hurdles that often put off\nfirst time entrepreneurs: incorporation,\nshare structures, taxes and accounting.\nAnd it has caught on even more than\nthey had imagined \u2013 \u201cthe response we\nhave gotten from the students accepted\ninto the program has been fantastic. In\nthe coming weeks one company is heading off to Stanford to showcase its work,\nand two are currently working on final\napplications to Y Combinator,\u201d says\nChristian. This is all the more impressive when you realise that there are only\nthree companies in this current cycle,\nwith a target of 10 to 15 for this summer.\nWhen asked about why they got involved and decided to set up UpStarts\nMatthew is clear in his beliefs, \u201cFor me\nit\u2019s because when I was studying software engineering I saw the potential of\nthe super-bright coders but there was no\nsupport from the university.\u201d Matthew\nstudied Computer Science at Durham.\n\u201cThen again at business school \u2013 all entrepreneurial sounding but not one lesson on sales or how to set up a company.\nAnd the winners of the business plan\ncompetition got \u00a310k but that was useless without further support/network.\nThat\u2019s what pissed me off. I\u2019ve worked\nfor the corporates and I just found them\ntoo restrictive and slow moving.\u201d\nChristian points out similar flaws\nin the UK system, \u201cThe best students\naren\u2019t offered help from their universities and so look at the big corporate jobs\nin consulting and banking instead, telling themselves \u2018I will do a startup later\u2019.\nThe problem is, before you know it, you\nwill have a mortgage, wife and kids and\na tough time trying to start a company.\nHowever, as a student, you are in the\nbest position to start something with\nnext to no risk attached. Absolutely\nnothing is holding you back.\u201d\nThe UK has four of the top ten universities in the world (QS World Rankings\n2011/12) and one of the greatest and\nmost diverse urban centres \u2013 London.\nHowever, until very recently, there has\nbeen a huge gap in the market for a venture that backs student entrepreneurs.\nWhich, when you think about it, makes\nlittle sense.\nThat scene is now starting to change.\nUniversity entrepreneurial societies\nhave been growing organically. In ad-dition, last year the Prime Minister announced that any higher institute without such a society would be assisted in\nits establishment by the end of 2012.\nWith the European debt crisis, there is\nclear government support to back entrepreneurship as a driving force of creating new jobs and reducing unemploy-ment. In this coming budget, the UK\ngovernment is set to announce a new\ninvestment option for business angels,\nthe Seed Enterprise Investment Scheme.\nThrough this, they can get up to 78% of\ntheir investment deducted from their income tax. Meaning it has never been a\nbetter time to be an Angel investor, and\ntherefore, the best time to seek out these\nAngels.\nSo what\u2019s next for Students UpStarts?\nRight now the current batch of companies are incorporated and being mentored by strong, relevant mentors as well\nas getting exposure to Business Angels\nand VCs, while networking into the\nLondon start-up scene and they are loving it. In the summer this could be you.\nChristian and Matthew are currently\nin the process of getting office space for\nthe summer startups around Shoreditch\nand the Silicon Roundabout, home to\nthe new Google offices (and more hip-sters than you have ever seen before!).\nIf this sounds like something you want\nto be a part of, applications opened this\nweek and you can apply online at www.\nstudentupstarts.com. The brilliant part\nis, your company can still be at the idea\nstage. So what\u2019s your excuse to not ap-ply?\nYou can stay up to date with Student\nUpStarts on Facebook, on Twitter\n@studentupstarts, or by dropping\nan email to contact@student-upstart.com.\nWhat do Steve Jobs, Bill Gates and\nMark Zuckerberg have in common with\neach other? Apart from being incredibly successful businessmen, all began\ntheir companies during the period that\nthey should have been in college - and\nall dropped out to do so. Indeed, a look\nthrough more recent history gives numerous examples of Americans who\nhave also begun their great adventure\nwhile still at university.\nIt is harder, though not impossible, to\nfind a similar list of Britons who have\ndone the same thing. But this simply\nmeans there is a clear opportunity to\nfind such people within our university\nsystem and not wait for them to caught\nup in the corporate life on graduation.\nStep forward, Student UpStarts.\nStudent UpStarts is a relatively new\naccelerator that sets itself apart by being\nfocused entirely on students. Founded\nby Christian Jakenfelds and Matthew\nStafford \u2013 both former Imperial students\n(Christian studied Biochemistry and\nMatthew graduated from the business\nschool with an MBA) - they realized\n\n"

    "content": "of a special approach to Africa that\nbegan with colonialism \u2013 it is an in-fantilising attitude that says that Africans are helpless without the West and\nmoreover that Africa\u2019s problems and\ntheir solutions are uniquely simple.\nSo simple that even, say, a four year\nold American could understand them.\nFrom this we come to the conclusion\nthat \u201cwe must do something\u201d. So we\nsend T-shirts to Kenya and destroy\ntheir local garment market. We spend\nthousands of pounds to send some\nA-level students to build a school in\nGhana, and take jobs from locals. We\nbuy some Kony 2012 bracelets to promote intervention in a war we don\u2019t\nunderstand and risk civilian lives.\nWhen we are ill-informed, \u201csomething\u201d is absolutely not better than\nnothing.\nThose who buy the bracelets and put\nup posters will never have to live with\nthe consequences of their demands.\nBut here we hit the heart of the matter\n\u2013 the video was never about Africans.\nIt was about us, the West. A message\nthat we are uniquely privileged and\npowerful in this world. That by simply\nposting or retweeting we are \u201cmaking\na difference\u201d. I don\u2019t doubt that those\ninvolved have genuine intentions, but\ntheir efforts are unlikely to do more\nthan make them feel good about themselves and have untold consequences\nin central Africa.\nSome good may yet come from Kony\n2012. The fierce backlash it promoted from development experts means\nthat more people are questioning the\nmotives and methods of charity campaigns in general. If it encourages\nviewers to take an interest in the LRA\nand read around the issue, it may well\ncreate and intelligent level of aware-ness. But neither of these was the\nintention of Kony 2012. In so far as\nit succeeds in its own goals, the campaign is likely to be harmful.\nFilm making can and should play\na powerful role in raising awareness\nof strife in other countries. A great\nexample of this is Channel 4\u2019s Sri\nLanka\u2019s Killing Fields which focussed\non interviewing those involved in\nthe country\u2019s civil war and using raw\nfootage of the conflict. It managed to\nbe both a powerful call for change and\nan intelligent, realistic account of the\nwar while maintaining the dignity of\nthose affected. Invisible Children, on\nthe other hand, chose simplification\nand Mumford & Sons. The public and,\nmore importantly, the LRA victims\ndeserve better.\nI\nf you\u2019ve been online at all in\nthe past week, chances are\nyou\u2019ll have seen Kony 2012,\na 30-minute video about the\nLord\u2019s Resistance Army (LRA)\nin central Africa made by the charity Invisible Children, officially the\nmost viral video in the history of the\ninternet. But along with the inevitable memes, the criticisms came hard\nand fast. You will likely have heard\nthat the charity has dubious finances,\nspending just 30% of its income on\nprojects in Africa, much of the rest on\npublicity. But this isn\u2019t why we should\nbe concerned by the success of Kony\n2012. Now a week later, we can reflect on a video that was dangerously\nsimplistic, misleading and ultimately\ndeeply patronising to Africans. This\narticle explains why.\nIt is the year 2007 and alien visitors\narrive to Earth. An American citizen,\nGeorge, needs their help. He shows\nthe aliens a video entitled Bin Laden\n2007. They see the terrible events in\nNew York in September 2001. They\nsee airborne steel slice through tall-standing concrete, they see the dust\ncloud envelop New York, they see the\nmisery and destruction, pain and an-guish; all created at the order of one\nman \u2013 Osama Bin Laden. Why did\nhe do all of this? \u201cHe hates America,\u201d comes the reply. The aliens are\nmoved. They want to help. Surely\nthey can do something for the poor\npeople of New York? And what about\nBin Laden? \u201cYour alien firepower can\nhelp us bring this man to justice, dead\nor alive.\u201d\nWe all know how the aftermath to\n9/11 turned out. We know that, contrary to what the aliens might think,\nNew York is back to being a thriving\nmajor city \u2013 those dust cloud images\nare simply out of date. We know that\nwhile Bin Laden was unmistakably\nvile, \u201cHe hates America\u201d just doesn\u2019t\nexplain terrorism away \u2013 it\u2019s more\ncomplicated than that. We know that\nvastly superior firepower, alien or not,\ndoes not make capturing the leader\nof a rebel organisation easy, not least\nwhen they can hide in unfamiliar terrain in a foreign country.\nWe now know that it took billions\nof dollars and two wars to finally kill\nBin Laden. We now know that simple\nanalyses of hostile groups, however\nvile they may be, are dangerous. We\nknow that foreign interventions do not\ncome without significant civilian ca-sualties. So now, in 2012, have really\nwe failed to learn this lesson?\nIn a word \u2013 yes. The similarities between Kony 2012 and America\u2019s response to 9/11 are as clear as they are\ndisturbing, a perfect marriage between\nBob Geldof and George W. Bush. Just\nlike Manhattan, northern Uganda is no\nlonger a war zone \u2013 the LRA left over\n6 years ago, a fact brushed over by\nKony 2012. As with Bin Laden, Kony\ncannot be explained away as an anomalous evil, Like Al Quaeda, the Lord\u2019s\nResistance Army exists because the\npolitical situation allows them to \u2013 in\nthe LRA\u2019s case, a complex mix of land\nissues, political rivalry and religion.\nJust as fighting the \u201cWar On Terror\u201d\nmeant collaborating with some very\nunpleasant regimes (like Egypt and\nSaudi Arabia) so too would the removal of Kony (the president of Uganda is\nall but a dictator).\nWar on Terror analogies aside, the\nvideo fails to reflect the reality on the\nground. It is simply not the case that\n\u201cnobody cares\u201d about the LRA. America has already sponsored two military\nstrikes against the group with the intention of killing Kony. One resulted\nin the deaths of eight Guatemalan special forces. And no Kony. The other,\nin 2008, resulted in an LRA backlash\nagainst civilians with 1,000 killed and\n500 children abducted. And no Kony.\nDoes this mean that military interven\u201cLike Geldof mixed with Bush\u201d\nAfrica finally gets what its always needed: a bunch of trigger-happy white American students\ntion can never work? No. But it does\nmean it is very complicated and un-predictable. It can also have terrible\nconsequences.\nAmerica currently has 100 military\n\u201cadvisors\u201d working to help the Ugandan army to track down Kony. They\nhave been there for just 5 months\nwithout the need for a Facebook\ncampaign and there has been no suggestion by the Obama administration\nthat they will be withdrawn. And yet\nthe video urges pressure on the White\nHouse to keep them there. Why? They\noffer no explanation.\nThirty minutes of YouTube was never\ngoing to suffice to tell the complete\nstory. But the problem with Invisible\nChildren isn\u2019t that they failed to tell a\ndetailed story, it\u2019s the very story they\nchose to tell. It is a centuries old story\nof a helpless, childlike Africa at a loss\nwithout \u201cour\u201d help. It is a story that\nmust stop.\nWatch Kony 2012 and the first thing\nthat jumps out to the politically correct among us has to be this \u2013 why\nso few Africans? It is supposed to be\nabout Africa, after all, and yet so much\nof the video is taken up by not just the\nwhite American director but his four-year-old white American son. Most of\nFELIX\nFriday 16 MARCH 2012\n18\npolitics.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nPolitics Editors: Rajat Jain\nJoseph Letts\nPOLITICS\nRory Fenton argues Kony 2012 is not just stupid \u2013 it sets a dangerous precedent\nMoving On\nAn American Analogy\nThe African Reality\nAn Attitude Problem\nthe interviews are with white American policy makers and activists, with\njust two Ugandan politicians (briefly)\nand a former child soldier making up\nthe African contingency. But this is a\nWest-focussed video because it has a\nWest-focussed message; the LRA\u2019s\ncontinued existence is because we in\nthe West don\u2019t care enough but \u201cmake\nKony famous\u201d and he can finally be\nbrought to justice. This is wildly de-luded.\nLet\u2019s be clear \u2013 Africa is not governed by quantum mechanics. It\ndoesn\u2019t need us to look at it to exist.\nThere are amazing local people working within their own communities to\nconfront the LRA. But more impor-tantly, Africa\u2019s problems are at least\nas complex as those in the West. After all, we still have desperate poverty\nin London, we have problems with\nour health system and kids who fail\nto learn basic literacy at school. We\nshould never give up trying to tackle\nthem but we acknowledge the lack of\na simple, one-size-fits-all solution and\nwe rely on experts to guide us. There\nis no reason to assume Africa\u2019s problems to be any less difficult. Not in-tractable, just difficult.\nSo why the different standards for\nAfrica? Why was Kony 2012\u2019s message so opposite to what we would\nwant for ourselves or, say, the Middle\nEast? We are seeing the continuation\n\n"

KVN (translates as\nClub of Funny and Ready-witted)\nhas been running for over 50 years in\nRussia, now spread all over the world\nincluding Australia, Canada, USA, Israel, Germany, and it started in the UK\nin 2010. It has had enormous success,\nand attracted teams from all over the\nworld for the Inter-continental Festival of KVN last year and also a set of\nworld-famous judges such as a Russian\nfootball player Roman Pavlyuchenko,\nprevious world champions of KVN and\nfamous Russian artists and producers.\nOur team was mainly made up of\nmasters and undergraduate students \u2013\nour team captain Elena Yaklych, Natalia Yankova, Alex Bukharin, Oksana\nIamshanova, Anna Volokitin as well as\nfour PhD students \u2013 Artyom Romanov,\nAlexey Denisov, Irina Tsymashenka,\nand Nickolai Vysokov, as well as two\nguys from outside of the university,\nEgor Savvin (LSBF) and Igor Jevseev.\nThe team has performed brilliantly on\nstage throughout and took the first place\nin quarter-finals, then in semi-finals\nround and won the finals! In the finals\nwe have withstood a fierce battle with\nLSE, London Kazakh Society (who\ntook the second place), Bournemouth\nUniversity, and a joint team from Oxford Brookes and City University.\nWe have presented the best jokes,\nfunniest and most original sketches\nto over 800 people from the Russian\ncommunity living in London. It took\nStudents from Imperial Jewish Society travelled to Lithuania to explore the country\u2019s Jewish heritage. JSoc\nmember Andrea Levy describes the experience of revisiting the past\nNickolai Vysokov\nCLUBS & SOCIETIES\nRussian standup and sketches impress to become United Kingdom\u2019s top group\nImperial KVN team take comedy crown\nI\nmperial JSoc members\nwrapped up to keep warm in\n-25\u00baC temperatures during\ntheir heritage trip to Lithuania.\nThe action began when nineteen\nvalorous Imperial College Jewish\nSociety members and Rabbi Broder,\nthe London Student Chaplain, met at\nLondon Gatwick airport to embark\non a surreal trip to Kovno, Lithuania \u2013 the second largest Lithuanian\ncity after Vilna. It would be a trip\nto a centre of European Jewry and\nrabbinic learning in the 18th to 20th\nCenturies. For many of us, it would\nalso be a trip of rediscovery of our\neastern European roots and of return\nto the very place our ancestors once\nfled from.\nFrom around the 14th Century, the\nJewish community in Lithuania grew\nconsiderably, probably as a result of\nthe fact that Vytautas the Great, ruler of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania\nfrom 1392 to 1430, granted freedoms\nto the Jews that were restricted else-where. These freedoms included the\nright to practice their faith and thus\nto celebrate their religious holidays,\nprotection of synagogues and cem-eteries, the right of unrestricted\nmobility, trade, financial activities,\namongst others.\nHence, Jews became deeply rooted in Lithuania, developing a rich\nheritage in the country, despite later\nturmoil, including persecution and\nexpulsion in the late 15th Century.\nAnti-Semitism picked up in the 20th\nCentury and culminated with the brutal assassination of the vast majority\nof the Lithuanian Jewish community\nby the Nazis in the Second World\nWar. In fact, a significant number\nof Jews in the UK have ancestors\namongst those who fled.\nThe expedition began when we\nmet our Kovno-born tour guide\nChaim, an expert of all things Jewish in Lithuania, and set off for Vilna.\nThe first stop was the small town in\n\u017die\u017emariai, where there had once\nbeen a Jewish community and where\nwe walked into what remained of\na wooden synagogue. It was an immediate connection to our past, and\nwe experienced the gratification of\nreturning to the place from where our\nancestors once fled. Indeed, the majority of Lithuanian Jews are known\nto have inhabited small towns such\nas this, which were a cradle of Jewish\nculture, whilst often working in the\nlarger cities.\nWe visited the largest Jewish cemetery in Lithuania in the outskirts\nof Vilna, where we saw the tomb of\nthe highly influential Rabbi Eliyahu\n(1720-1797), known as the Vilna\nGaon (\u201cgenius of Vilna\u201d) after an\nenlightening talk about his ethos by\na direct descendant of his among us.\nOnce in Vilna, a noteworthy visit was\nto the site where the first copies of the\n\u201cVilna Shas\u201d were printed, which is\nused throughout the Jewish world as\nthe authoritative, traditional edition\nof the Talmud; rabbinic discussion\nconcerning Jewish law. Indeed, there\nwas a widespread saying that \u201cif one\nwants to gain wisdom \u2013 one goes to\nVilnius\u201d, given the vast number of\ncentres of biblical study and distinguished scholars in the city.\nWe came together in the evening for\na superb, traditional JSoc Friday night\ndinner with Israeli students of medicine in Kovno. The next morning, on\nwalking around the Kovno city centre\nit became clear we were the only ones\nimprudent enough to be outside in\nsuch cold, snow-lined streets \u2013 there\nwasn\u2019t a soul to be seen. An ideal opportunity to roll down hills covered\nby snow in the island formed at the\nconfluence of the two rivers \u2013 the\nNemuras and the Neris.\nFurthermore, remarkable visits\nmade on our last day, included the\nnow abandoned synagogue in the\nKovno town of Alexandrot, where\nRabbi Israel Salanter was based; head\nof the Mussar movement \u2013 a Jewish\nethical and educational movement,\nborn in 19th Century Lithuania. We\nwalked the streets of the Slobodka\nneighbourhood where the renowned\nSlobodka Yeshiva (Jewish educational institution) was once located\nand stood before breath-taking views\nof Kovno, on a hill where the first\nnovel written in Hebrew is thought to\nhave been written, by the rivers which\nwere once the border between Russia\nand former Prussia.\nMost notable perhaps, was listening\nto Chaim narrate to us the story of escape of the last group of Jewish prisoners of Fort 9, a Nazi concentration\ncamp. Standing in the dark silence of\nthe tunnels in the fort in the biting\ncold was a powerful means of helping\nus understand what was experienced\nby our forerunners.\nIn essence, we are very thankful to\neveryone who made this trip possible.\nThe trip was funded by Holocaust survivor and businessman William Stern,\nUJS, Tribe and Imperial College\nUnion. Thanks also go to the enthusiastic organizers of the trip within\nImperial JSoc, Noah Nathan first and\nforemost, not to mention Gabriella\nLebrecht and Yoni Weiner. Not only\nwas it a cool off \u2013 -25\u00baC cool off \u2013\nfrom a long week at university, but a\nunique experience we won\u2019t forget.\nus hours of brainstorming, weekends\nof rehearsal, and sacrificing the time\nwe should have devoted to education to\ncome up with the jokes tailor-made for\nthe audience and to perfect the details\nof our acting to deliver a show we can\nbe proud of.\nNo words can describe the energy\nemanating from the stage during the\nperformance and no English words\ncan translate the witty wordplay, so to\nexperience it one would have to come\nand see it live if you speak Russian or\nif you\u2019re learning it and can come along\nwith someone who speaks Russian (to\nexplain the references to political and\ncultural background). But to give you\na flavour \u2013 our first performance in\nthe quarter-finals started with a geeky\ncharacter coming on stage with a dead-serious announcement that \u201cImperial\nCollege scientists have successfully\ncrossed Large Hadron Collider with a\nwashing machine.

Having brought only 11 players to a ULU Cup\ngame against UCL (who play BUCS in the league above us), we have now grown to a squad of over 30\nthanks to the appointment of our coach Danny Badham in January, and the wonderful cameraderie\nof the team.\nOther highlights saw a tense rematch agains Kings College London.

An amazing testament to the effort and imporovement of all the girls.

We\u2019ve enjoyed being\nvegan more than we thought we would. Our\npreconception of the vegan lifestyle was that\nof tasteless and unfulfilling meals that satisfied your body, but not your mind. So it was\na surprise when we found that actually some\nparts of being vegan were pretty good.\nWe\u2019ve both enjoyed soya milk, albeit different forms. Clare enjoyed having her Alpro Soy sweetened soya milk in everything,\nfrom tea to cereal, and is pretty much planning on sticking with it after we finish. In\ncontrast Hannah enjoyed unsweetened soya\nmilk in tea, but couldn\u2019t face it at all on its\nown or in cereal. So while she conquered\nher biggest potential challenge when taking\non veganism (maintaining her daily tea-fix),\nshe\u2019s excited at the prospect of drinking a\nnice cold cup of creamy fully dairy milk.\nAfter all you can\u2019t beat the real McCoy.\nAdditionally there\u2019ve been some pretty\ngood meals! A particular favourite was\na mixed vegetable and barley soup \u2013 really wholesome and warm for the winter\nmonths. If you want the recipe, comment on\nthe article online and we\u2019ll send it to you.\nVeganism is often portrayed as one of the\nhealthiest lifestyles you can follow, with minimum saturated fat and a lack of processed\nfoods, just plenty of vegetables, pulses and\ngrains. With this in mind we expected to feel\nhealthier and to shed a few pounds. The true\nreality of the situation is that yes, we have\nlost a few pounds, which is great! However\nwe don\u2019t feel it\u2019s a surefire thing that you\nwould, because we often found ourselves in\nthe situation of compensating our meat for\ncarbs. Perhaps it\u2019s only because we made a\nconscious effort to use this month to (dare we\nsay it) diet a little that we managed to avoid\nthis trap; there is such a thing as a fat vegan!\nIt\u2019s incredibly difficult to maintain a balanced diet, particularly with regards to pro-tein. After all there\u2019s so many beans you\ncan eat before it\u2019s antisocial. We have been\nfeeling tired constantly and concentration during lectures has been more difficult\nthan usual. A good chocolate bar is what\nwe would normally need to keep ourselves\ngoing; that endorphin and sugar rush that\npushes you through your afternoon sched-ule. We did find a good alternative in Nakd\nbars. Clare would really recommend the\nChocolate Orange flavour and would continue to eat them occasionally after finishing\nveganism. Hannah on the other hand preferred the Banana Bread and the Apple Pie\nflavours. They tasted so much like the real\nthing, an opinion with which Clare concurs.\nHaving said that, they weren\u2019t the real thing\nand often made you miss them even more.\nSo now we\u2019re coming to the end we\u2019re\nlooking ahead to that fateful hour when milk,\nsteak, sushi and a boiled egg will be able\nto pass our lips again. As you might imag-ine, a little like a final meal on death row,\nwe\u2019ve been giving quite a lot of thought to\nwhat we\u2019re going to eat first. It\u2019s a difficult\ndecision, which could lead to dairy-meat-filled binge, resulting in hospitalization.\nHannah is definitely looking forward to her\nfirst mug of cow-milk tea \u2013 she\u2019ll have the\nwater boiled ready for the stroke of midnight!\nThe following day she\u2019s going to feast on a\njuicy steak with b\u00e9arnaise sauce and Heston\u2019s brilliant triple cooked chips (she\u2019s literally salivating as we write). Clare shall be\nhaving herself a huge Chinese takeaway, no\nscrimping on the roast duck pancakes. Perhaps she may even top it off with some sushi\nat the end\u2026 she\u2019s pretty desperate right now.\nWe\u2019ve realized that veganism isn\u2019t the\nend of the world for food lovers. It makes\neveryday life that little more difficult when\nyou walk down the aisles of delicious Easter Eggs or pass a good ol\u2019 burger bar with\nthat smell of meaty goodness. It\u2019s virtually\nimpossible to eat out at most restaurants;\na handy tuppa wear box of humus and crudit\u00e9s must accompany you at all times.\nFor us this is definitely a one off. Our love\nof food conquers our love of animals and\nthe environment \u2013 sorry tree huggers. However as mentioned previously there are lots of\nthings we\u2019ve enjoyed about being vegan, and\nwill carry on in the future. In particular what\nwe will try to continue with is the principle of\nhaving a vegetable based diet with a steak on\ntop of course. Previously to undertaking this\nchallenge, the balance of our plate was definitely in favour of a nice piece of meat or fish.\nPerhaps this is one of the reasons why obesity\nrates world wide are so high as people have\nlost sight of what a truly balanced diet is. After finishing our vegan month we\u2019re definitely\ngoing to make more informed food choices.\nTo conclude, veganism has been an eye\nopening experience; not a life choice that\u2019s for\nus, but very informative and something we\u2019ll\nnever forget. Thank you for reading and please\nremember this was all for charity, so please\ngive generously at uk.virginmoneygiving.\ncom/team/goingvegan We\u2019ve earned it!\nAs you all know we\u2019ve been doing all of\nthis for the Multiple Sclerosis Trust. For\nthose of you who don\u2019t know MS is a neu-rodegenerative disease, where over time\nthe neurons of the nervous system lose\ntheir myelin and eventually die altogether.\nThere\u2019s no cure and it mainly affects people around our age (20s-30s). Many of\nyou will know somebody in your lifetime\nwho is struck down by this disease.\nHopefully however with support from\nthe MS Trust that person will get the best\ncare possible. They raise awareness of\nthe disease, provide advice to patients\nand families of suffers, as well as fund\ncrucial research to improve therapies\nand perhaps one day find the cure. It is\nessential for the continuation of the trust\nthat they get support from the likes of\nyou and I.\nSo far we\u2019ve raised close to \u00a3600\nthanks to people\u2019s generous support.\nHowever we\u2019re still hoping to raise more\nby doing a marathon bag-packing ses-sion, as well as going around campus on\nMonday 19 March with Hummingbird cup-cakes.

Ever since starting her\nvocal career at the WOMAD festival in 2007, Sally\nArcher has performed in many gigs around the\ncountry and has recorded in Abbey Road Studios.\nHer songs include a selection of heartfelt melodies\nwith beautiful piano and soulful guitar parts; and of\ncourse the wonderful blend of her voice can\u2019t help\nbut make you smile.\nSally\u2019s first EP\n, Wonder, was released last May.\nThe get-up-and-go title track has creative jazz-influenced rhythms and a warm, bright feel, while\nthe beautiful \u2018Gold\u2019s Fool\u2019 has a mellowness which\nmakes the passion in Sally\u2019s vocals stand out. The\ntalent and charisma of her accompanying band of\nmusicians shine through particularly in the title\ntrack and the last track, \u2018Fearless\u2019. Along with her\nwell crafted blues-influenced music, the stories in\nSally\u2019s lyrics are deep, emotional and profoundly\nhonest. As an artist, Sally has also made the album artwork herself. Overall, the EP has a charming quality to it with a lovely mix of colours, moods\nand sentiments.\nFollowing her last stunning performance at The\nCuban Bar on Wednesday, Sally will be coming to\nthe Imperial College Union Level 1 to perform in a\nlive lounge along with other artists, which is kicking off on Friday 16th March at 7pm (hosted by the\nImperial College Christian Union).\nR\negular readers of my column\nprobably need little introduction to the label that I concern\nmyself with this week. Hyperdub has, with not a hint of exag-geration, been the most influential electronic\nmusic label to have come out of London in a\nlong, long time. Why then, you may ask, has\nit taken me so goddamn long to dedicate some\nprime Felix real-estate to the imprint? Well\nHyperdub is the music label equivalent of a\nseven foot, teardrop-tattooed, switchblade-wielding nut job: fucking intimidating.\nThis is the label that, in 2005, introduced\nthe world to Burial; the elusive and outlandishly gifted producer hailing from the same\nSouth London school that produced Joe Goddard (Hot Chip), Kieran Hebden (Four Tet)\nand The XX. In all honesty, it was this man\u2019s\nmost recent release that prompted me to write\nthis, and I could cover many columns in literary masturbation about the guy. But I won\u2019t.\nIt\u2019s eight years ago that Hyperdub released\nits first record, and in those early days the\nlabel was predominantly used by the owner,\nSteve Goodman aka Kode9, to put out his\nown material. Kode9 (often teaming up with\nMC The Spaceape) makes dark, jungle and\ndub reggae infused electronic music that can\nbe both smooth and bitingly aggressive at the\nsame time. Following the release of Burial\u2019s\nMercury nominated album Untrue (ultimately\nbeaten by Elbow\u2019s Seldom Seen Kid), Hyperdub added several new artists to its roster.\nZomby, Samiyam, Ikonika and King Midas\nSound all released music on the label in 2008\nand since then output has only increased.\nAs the UK dubstep scene grew out of\nSouth-East London in the mid-late 00\u2019s, Hyperdub began drawing fans from around the\nworld. Kyle Hall (Detroit), Samiyam (LA)\nand Hype Williams (New York) have all put\nout EPs on the label, giving it, and the London scene it champions, further exposure to\nhuge audiences. Despite this diversity that\nhas spread across the label, Hyperdub\u2019s output is still heavily London based with one of\nmy favourite tunes of last year; Ossie\u2019s \u2018Set\nthe Tone\u2019 which layered meltingly smooth\nvibes over lively staccato percussion. Terror Danjah, the grime-rave producer from\nEast London and part of the Butterz crew, has\nalso seen several releases on Hyperdub, adding yet another side to label\u2019s ever-expanding\nmetaphorical music polygon.\nAnd yet, I can\u2019t resist. Some mention has to\ngo to Hyperdub and Burial\u2019s most recent re-lease; the Kindred EP. This record sees Burial\ntake a different path; yes the stuttering drum\npatterns and haunting vocal samples are still\nthere but in the underlying feeling there is a\nstark difference. The tone is more aggressive,\nthe songs are longer \u2013 pulling you further and\nfurther into the twisted and emotional soundscapes \u2013 and just when you think a song has\nfinished, it evolves and spits something else\nout at you. The track \u2018Loner\u2019 sees Burial take\ninfluence from 90\u2019s rave rhythms but layers\nthem over a bass line so full of dread there\u2019s\nno way those kids would have been able to\ndrop a handful of pills to this without ending\nup curled in a corner, shaking with fear.\nIt\u2019s taken me a long time to get this out of\nmy system, and in a way it\u2019s been therapeutic.\nI\u2019m no longer scared but, boy, does Hyperdub\ndemand respect.\nTechno Nonsense: Hyperdub\nSimon Hunter gets to grips with London\u2019s latest dance music pioneers\nHoney for the bears of the future.\nEASTER GIGGING\nPelican\nChicago post-metal quartet Pelican\nplay Relentless Garage in Camden,\nsupporting their upcoming EP Ataraxia/Taraxis.

    "content": "Over the past ten weeks, I\u2019ve tried to give an\ninsight into the wonderful world of post-hardcore\nmusic. Hopefully I\u2019ve achieved my goal in revamping the record collection of the old-timer P-H fans\nand perhaps even converted some people previously sceptical about this incredible genre. However, the sad truth is that there\u2019s probably very\nfew of you willing to read anything labelled \u201cposthardcore\u201d but for anyone that is, I urge you to read\nthis summary and listen to the bands mentioned,\nyou will not be disappointed.\nStarting with the old favourites of post-hardcore,\nwe came across At The Drive-In with their drug-induced weirdness and unpredictable live shows.\nNext up was Refused, a hardcore band from\nSweden who fathered modern heavy punk. The\nalmighty Glassjaw came third with American metalcore heroes Every Time I Die following in week\nfour. Then we had The Fall of Troy and witnessed\nThomas Erak\u2019s godlike guitar mastery. Week six\nthen saw a change of setting as I began to let you\ninto the UK post-hardcore scene and the amazing\nbands it has to offer. Firstly there was funny men\nReuben and then the apparent vagrant-led Meet\nMe In St. Louis bringing us up to two weeks ago.\nWe then had the ever-ranting Blakfish and finally\nexplosive trio Shapes.\nAll of these bands, while quite different are phenomenal in their own way and I would strongly\nencourage you to check them all out. On a more\nspecific note, you can find so many decent UK\npost-hardcore bands if you just look around the\nFacebook pages of Shapes etc. and I would really\nrecommend you do this because, in the words of\nBlakfish, the scene is dead, and any underground\nbands you find will really need the support that\nyou can give them. Don\u2019t get me confused with\nLenny Henry though. I\u2019m not trying to get charity\nfor these bands; the music they produce is astonishingly good and any money they get is more\nthan well-deserved. These bands are constantly\ntouring and their shows (just like all post-hardcore\nshows) are fucking awesome, just have a look\naround and there will definitely be something you\u2019ll\nenjoy, normally in some terrible area of London\nbut the shows are definitely worth getting a little\nbit stabbed for.\nIf you are a rich man however, something far\nmore appealing may be Sonisphere 2012 which\nwill have the newly reformed Refused as well as\nGlassjaw playing Worship and Tribute in its en-tirety. Unfortunately I will not be attending as the\npleasure overload would render me a deadman.\nFinally, never stop listening to post-hardcore\u2026\never.\nGeorge Jeffery\u2019s\nA beginner\u2019s guide to\npost-hardcore\nFinal Lesson: Summary\nMUSIC\nFELIX Friday 16 March 2012 31\nC\nontinuing my recent binge of\nchurch-based gigs, last Sunday\nI had a beautiful foray to The\nUnion Chapel to see Earth\u2019s\ntour, supported by Mount Eerie and the pretty obscure French Canadian\n\u00d4 Paon. If you read my recent review of\nNicolas Jaar at Roundhouse, you\u2019ll be well\naware that sweaty, active gigs are not really\nmy thing. As such, spending several hours sitting in a cold church listening to some sweet\n\u2018ATP\u2019-presented music is pretty much ideal.\nSadly this review will likely lack in humour\nas all the patrons were not absolute mugs, so\nremained quiet and respectful throughout, as\nit always should be.\n\u00d4 Paon opened the show, which she informed us was her biggest ever. Her sound is\nsomewhat hard to describe but she reminded\nme of a more singer-songwriter style grou-per; intricately layered structures of delicate\nguitar and vocals built up through extensive\nlooping. Her singing also made me think\nin places of Braids\u2019 Raphaelle StandellPreston, with long notes extremely full and\na playful vocal style. Numerous tricks were\nemployed to coax the full range of timbres\nfrom her voice and guitar; she would turn her\nhead mid-note to produce a Doppler effect,\nalongside not-so standard guitar practice\nsuch as scraping her pick along the ridges\nof the strings. All of the lyrics were sung in\nFrench but this was in no way to her detri-ment; it allowed you to focus more on the\nmelodies and layers she was creating. Besides, I\u2019m sure whatever her lyrics were they\nwere pretty great.\nI was pretty excited for Mount Eerie\u2019s slot,\nmostly because I was hopeful he would play\nsome of his fantastic 2009 black metal inspired folk album Wind\u2019s Poem. Upon opening he immediately dashed my hopes, coming\nout with a 12-string guitar and informing us\n\u201cThis is all new material tonight\u201d. Obviously\nhe stuck to his word and we were treated to\na set entirely consistent of tracks I had never\nheard before. I can\u2019t help but feel I ruined\nEerie\u2019s set for myself by not paying atten-tion; I\u2019d assure myself that I would focus on\nhis deep lyricism (perhaps his strongest trait),\nbut instead ended up daydreaming every\ntrack. He managed to get some interesting\nsounds out of his guitar, and I did particularly\nenjoy \u2018House Shapes\u2019, a track which opened\nwith 4 \u2013 5 second blasts of atonal strumming,\neach separated by piercing silence. All of the\nnew material was in a far more standard Eerie/The Microphones style, with the two releases penned for May and September.\nThe man who invented drone metal, Dylan\nCarson, revealed no shocks with his band\nEarth, now known for their \u201ccountry doom\u201d \u2013\nstill slow, drawn out instrumental tracks, but\nfar less heavy than his massively influential\nmaterial (so influential that Sunn O))) named\na track after him). Earth played mostly from\ntheir newest album Angels of darkness, Demons of Light II. In this incarnation, Carson\nis accompanied by a bassist, drummer and\ncellist. It was particularly interesting to hear\nsome old tracks (though nothing Earth 2 era)\nsuch as \u2018Tallahassee\u2019 performed with the cel-lo; for this track the cello was put through a\npedal that gave it an extremely deep, doomy\nsound.\nThe (pre-encore) set was ended with \u2018The\nBees Made Honey in the Lion\u2019s Skull\u2019, probably the highlight of the evening. Each member of the band is extremely tight in their\nplaying, and everything is controlled perfectly \u2013 in this track, extensive use was made\nnot only of guitar feedback, but also cello.\nThis feedback was never the kind of raw idiocy you would hear morons like Kasabian\n(if they even use feedback, I haven\u2019t listened\nto them \u2013 just blindly assuming) idiotically\nbashing out, it was carefully handled, subtle,\nand surprisingly quiet. The cello\u2019s feedback\nprovided deep, resonant bass, only noticeable\nif you listened really carefully. These short\nbursts of feedback were always followed by\na drop straight back into the grooves Earth\nmanage to develop in their generally 10 minute upwards tracks. While it\u2019s obviously not\nwhat you would expect had you only heard\nthe drone metal albums, Dylan Carson is\nstill a musical force to be reckoned with and\nI highly recommend that if you can, you try\nand catch this tour at some point.\nSamurai Jack rides an antelope for the Day of the Dead\nAccurate representation of French Canada\nEarth shattering performance\nRoss Gray spends Sunday in a church... and enjoys it\n\n"

    "content": "In Brief\nMotor Club races towards fire\nengine repair\nMembers of RCS Motor Club have got one stop\ncloser to fully repairing Jezebel, the RCSU\u2019s 1916\nfire engine, after successful remetalling of an engine bearing, and reconstruction of the engine. Jezebel has been off the road since the end of last\nyear, following an engine fault when travelling back\nfrom Brighton.\nThe new bearing has been produced in house\nby the club, utilising the expertise of the club\u2019s\nalumni members. Following part of a metal ingot\nbeing molten down and cast to form the new bear-ing, it was then machined and etched to form a\ngood fit with the engine. The engine has now been\nrebuilt, with distinctive features such as the pots,\nradiator, and lights now reattached.\nJezebel now runs again under her own power,\nand is capable of driving around. However, there\nis still reassembly work to do, such as reattaching\nthe bonnet, before the repair is complete. These\nalterations are expected to be completed soon.\nThe club have also recorded the production of\nthe new bearing, with a view to produce this into a\nvideo released to the general public.\nPhilip Kent\nFEATURE\nFELIX\nFriday 16 MARCH 2012\n8\nfeatures.felix@gmail.com\nFeatures Editors: Katy Bettany\nStephen Smith\nUnseen Imperial\nAnonymous accounts of student experiences\nT\nhere are some aspects of our\nlives that we just don\u2019t talk about.\nThis makes it easy to think that\nwe\u2019re alone in our experiences,\nwhen in fact, we\u2019re probably not.\nLast week the Union asked the student\nbody to submit anonymous accounts of\ntheir experiences of mental health. Sincere\nthanks to everyone who took part \u2013 here\nare the responses:\nL\nast year my father was diagnosed with a serious illness. It\nwas the tipping point in a chain\nof events that lead me to where\nI am today. Talking about my\nfeelings, especially when it involves seeing\ndoctors and potentially taking medication,\nhas been met with very mixed responses. I\u2019m\nhoping by contributing and telling my story\nI\u2019ll be able to tell my friends the secrets that\nI have kept from them for fear of what they\nwill think.\nI\u2019ve always been a stressy and panicky\nperson and throughout school my family,\nmy friends and I learnt to deal with it. Then,\nwhen I came to University, it was picked up\nby my personal tutor who thought it might be\nbest that I speak to a councillor in College.\nTo put the experience in short, I hated it. I\nwent to one session and within the space of\nabout 30 seconds I wanted to run. From that\npoint on I decided I\u2019d just have to cope.\nOver the course of the next few months\nthings went from OK to bad. Little things\nbecame a big deal. I couldn\u2019t go to a party\nwithout feeling suffocated and really alone. I\ncouldn\u2019t go on a tube or into a shop without\ntears filling my eyes. I couldn\u2019t keep on top\nof my studying without exhausting myself\nfrom fretting. I decided to go home for the\nweekend to get away from it all.\nIt was that Friday night that I was told about\nmy father. My whole world came crashing\ndown. Despite the positivity of his doctors\nmy mind immediately jumped to the worst\nconclusions. I cried a lot. I stopped sleeping.\nThe stress I was feeling started to manifest itself in physical problems that made me snappy and unsociable. At this point, just before\nmy exams, my mother suggested that I go see\nthe GP. She referred me to a councillor in the\nhealth centre.\nThe counselling at the Health Centre began as awfully as it had previously in College. There were awkward silences and it\nwas quite frankly really weird talking to a\nstranger about my life. I felt like my problems were silly, but I persevered. I knew I\ncouldn\u2019t continue to rely on my mother. After the third session I finally started thinking about me and sorting myself out. As a\nscientist one tends to learn to think in black\nand white. Then when there is no evidence\nyou tend to think it\u2019s not valid. It\u2019s hard to\nO\nK, so here goes: In the not-too-distant past, I was raped. I was\nraped by someone I called my\nfriend, in my own bedroom,\nduring the day. And it is because of these details in particular that I would\nlike to write this note.\nLike probably most of you, I was taught by\nmy parents, by my schools, and by the media\nthat I should be aware of the dangers of being raped when going out at night. I should not\ndress in a revealing manner, I should carry my\ndrink around with me, I should be wary of men\nthat I do not know, and I should go home in a\ntaxi or licensed cab, or via the main, well-lit\nstreets. It seems na\u00efve and stupid now, but this\nis how I thought rape was played out. And I\nthought that the victim would be visibly, physically hurt, and be left in some strange room or\ndark alleyway.\nSo at the time, because of my misconceptions about what rape is and the circumstances\nunder which it can happen, I was totally taken\naback and I was unprepared. Then after what\nhappened, I saw it in some way as not being\na \u201creal\u201d rape. I tried to be logical about it, and\nsaid to myself that if I just forgot about it, it\nwouldn\u2019t hurt me. I managed to do this so well\ndefine anything about the process that you\nhave to go through to change your mentality.\nIt\u2019s a way of thinking that I had never before\nemployed.\nSo here I am today. I have learnt that I cannot just deal with my worry and low mood;\nI have to consciously make an effort to stop\nit. Sometimes it\u2019s exhausting. Sometimes I\nfeel myself taking a step backwards and even\nsometimes things still spiral a bit. But I know\nI\u2019ll get there; it\u2019s a work in progress that I\nknow will never be complete because no one\nparticular thing is going to stop it and make\nit all go away.\nYou may feel that you\u2019re fully accepting of\nmental illness but imagine if your best friend\ntold you they were on anti-depressants. I\nknow how some of the people closest to\nme reacted and it upset me and it stopped\nme from speaking to anyone about my ex-perience. If you\u2019re reading this and you\u2019re\nanxious about revealing how you\u2019re feeling\n- don\u2019t be! There\u2019s a wide network of support out there to help you even if, like me,\nyou chose not to tell your friends. Use it. I\npromise you that it\u2019ll help if you can give it\nthe chance and are prepared to put in some\neffort.\nEmail icu-disabilities@imperial.ac.uk if you would like to share your anonymous experiences of top\nBike auction brings the money\nOn Monday lunchtime ICU RAG and the Bike User\u2019s\nGroup for the Imperial College Community (BUG)\nheld this year\u2019s second bike auction. Up for sale\nwere 52 bikes varying from basic and run-down to\nhigh-end racing frames. Prices this time around\nwere lower than October\u2019s highly successful auc-tion, in part due to lower numbers in attendance\nand also due to the variable bike quality.\nHead of Sport Imperial Neil Mosley once again\ntook on the role of auctioneer. BUG raised funds\nfor their workshop (with plans currently in prog-ress) and RAG raised money for charity.\nThe total raised from the bikes sold amounted\nto \u00a31,100, with some rolling over to the next auc-tion. This was a successful start to Cycling Week,\nand the Dr. Bike Mechanics on-site once again\nproved very useful to the students, both for bikes\nbought at auction and those from home, providing\nboth repairs and professional and personal advice\nabout the bikes and cycling.\nSpecial thanks go to everyone who came along,\nAndy from Sport Imperial, Deputy President (Wel-fare) Nicolas Massie and College Security for all\ntheir help in securing the bikes, auctioning them\noff and assistance provided on the day, and Stef\nPiatek for organising everything.\nJack Hewitt \u2013 RAG Chair\nAfonso Campos\nThe auction spinning into action\n\n"

    "content": "COMMENT\nFELIX Friday 16 march 2012 25\nThere aren\u2019t enough intellectuals\nT\nhe world is ruled by aggressive simpletons. We\nhave all met jobsworths\nand nice guys, people\nwho run things according\nto the first thing that comes into their\nhead, rather than thinking it through.\nThe first example of this I came\nacross in the political arena was the\nmonarchy debate. There are a number\nof British people who describe themselves as republicans, many of whom\ncomplain bitterly about the royal fam-ily. This seems to include a disparaging tone about the members of the\nfamily themselves, what they do or are\nperceived to do, the constitutional position they hold, and perhaps even how\nthat position fits into the running of the\nBritish state. All of these things are de-lineable, but are never separated in the\ndebate. Added to which, what republicans think it should be replaced with\nis at least as unclear. An elected head\nof state? How will they be elected,\nand by whom, and how often? Royalists are frequently no better. They do\nnot complain of course, because they\nhave their way. But rarely, if ever, do\nthey put forward a coherent set of reasons for retaining a hereditary monar-chy. So the debate, such as it is, falls\napart \u2013 or never really starts in the first\nplace. It just becomes a raging torrent\nof abuse from republicans up against\nslight bewilderment from royalists.\nThe NHS reform bill disagreement\nhas many of the same characteristics.\nWe have an elected government who\nare doing what they have said they\nwill, but in a way that is making a lot\nof people bleat furiously. The bleating\nmay be perfectly correct and justified,\nalthough we will not know that until it\nis far too late. As with most government policy, it is probably going to be\na mixture of success and failure that is\nall too murky to pick apart. Certainly,\nwe cannot tell exactly what will hap-pen, not least because the NHS is far\ntoo big and complicated to be readily\npredictable. The anti-NHS-reform-bill\ncampaigners do seem to include quite\na lot of medical professionals, but despite their undoubted intellectual abil-ity, they have failed miserably at putting forward any coherent argument\nagainst it. Their poster campaign is\na perfect example: a picture of a photogenic woman physician and a strap\nline about a high percentage of medical professionals being against the bill\nbecause it will destroy the NHS.\nEven if it will destroy the NHS \u2013\nwhich seems unlikely, frankly \u2013 why\nis that the best way of getting the point\nacross? Yes, the attractive female\nmedic makes it look better, but why\nshould she, or others at her level in\nthe organisation, be seen as knowing\nwhat will and will not work in a public\nservice health care system? To put it\nanother way, why should a junior doctor be in a position to run the NHS?\nCompare it to the idea of a train driver\nbeing in charge of a railway or a postdoc running a University. It is just not\nrealistic. More than that, there is no\ncoherent argument from the self same\npeople about what should be being\ndone with the NHS. The opposition to\nthe bill has become a stroppy barrage\nof loathing for both the proposal and\nits proponents.\nAs I say, they may turn out to be cor-rect, but I think it is more likely to be\nonly partly correct at best. In any case,\nsurely, in order to deal with this benighted legislation in an effective way,\nthe opposition to it needs a coherent\nand well-articulated set of arguments.\nMedics are not stupid people, why are\nthey not fighting this on intellectual\ngrounds? I cannot see why taking an\nintellectual approach would be ill-ad-vised, provided you had lucid reason\non your side, whether it be politically\nleft, right or down the middle. But\nperhaps I am not intellectual enough to\nsee its short-comings.\nSamuel Furse\nL\net me ask: what have you\npersonally done to prevent\nrape recently? If you\u2019re a\nman, the answer is hopefully \u201cnot raped anyone.\u201d\nIf you\u2019re a woman, the answers will be\nmany: avoiding dark places at night,\navoiding walking alone, taking a taxi\nrather than public transport, not making\neye contact with people in the street,\nkeeping away from groups of men or\ncalling a friend to make sure that they\ngot home safely. This is only considering the relatively rare case of people\nbeing raped by strangers in the street,\ncompared to the much more common\ncrime of being raped by someone you\nknow or someone you\u2019ve just met in a\nsocial situation, which requires its own\npreventions: not getting too drunk, not\ntaking drugs at a party, watching one\u2019s\ndrink, and avoiding going to social\nevents without close friends. Men reading this might be shocked at such mea-sures: surely all of that\u2019s not necessary?\nIt is. Rape, sexual assault and harassment happen. In 2006, the UK saw\n85,000 rapes \u2013 around 230 per day. Of\nthese, less than 1% led to a conviction.\nOf children aged 13 to 18, 33% of girls\nand 16% of boys have suffered from\nsome form of sexual abuse. In total,\n15% of women are victims of rape at\nsome point in their lifetime, and it is believed that 85% of rapes go unreported.\nThink about those numbers for a mo-ment: someone you know, likely several people, has been raped or sexually\nJust a joke?\nassaulted. You may not know about it;\nthey may not talk about it, but it hap-pens.\nThis brings us to our infamous Hangman article for two reasons, the first of\nwhich is rape culture. Even disregarding the abysmal rate of conviction noted\nabove, you may be thinking \u201crapists\nare hated by society, how can there be\na \u2018rape culture\u2019?\u201d Rape culture is not\na culture of rapists or one that glorifies them, but a culture that downplays\nor even disregards the effects of rape.\nIt\u2019s the idea that women who dress provocatively are \u201casking for it;\u201d the idea\nthat a woman who\u2019s sexually active or\ndoesn\u2019t fight back is \u201csecretly enjoying\nit;\u201d the idea that if someone does walk\nthrough a dark place at night, they \u201chad\nit coming to them.\u201d No one deserves to\nbe raped. These ideas blame the victim for something that isn\u2019t their fault,\nand in doing so, they take some of the\nblame away from the rapist. The tactics\nfor preventing rape may well be good\nadvice, but they do not constitute blaming someone who fails to follow them:\nif I leave my door unlocked, it is still\nthe burglar\u2019s fault if my TV gets nicked.\nSimilarly, no one believes that people\nwill read Hangman and then date rape\nsomeone, or condone someone who\ndoes. Each joke like that, however, contributes to a culture in which rape isn\u2019t\nsomething serious, but something to\nbe laughed at: where victims of a horrid crime are ignored or dismissed, and\nwhere criminals are seen as, \u201coh, those\nsilly rapists!\u201d It leads to a culture in\nwhich rapists aren\u2019t brought to trial or\nconvicted; where victims are afraid to\nreport that they\u2019ve been raped and people raped by their partners can\u2019t even\nturn to the police for help, because it\u2019s\nbelieved that such a thing simply can\u2019t\nhappen. This is rape culture, and it is\neverywhere, even here at Imperial.\nSecondly, given the statistics above,\nthink how many people here are victims\nof rape or sexual abuse. Think of how\nmany people there are reading this article now, and who read Hangman on\nthe 10th of February. Rape is a traumatic experience, which can cause long-term distress and damage to sufferers.\nDescriptions of rape, especially those\nHumour and context are linked in obvious and less obvious ways\nRape culture is not\na culture of rapists\nor one that glorifies\nthem, but a culture\nthat downplays or\neven disregards the\neffects of rape.\n\u201d\nards the\nards the\npe.\npe.\n\u201c\nRape c\nRape c\na cultu\na cultu\nwhich present it in a trivial, humorous\nlight, can trigger anxiety and panic attacks in victims. Do we really want a\nnewspaper distributed to over 13,000\nstudents doing that?\nOn some level, there\u2019s a time and\na place for every joke: you might see\nme, for example, playing a game which\ntrivialises violence and makes fun of\npeople blowing up. You would not see\nme, however, laughing at such a thing\nin the context of any real war or shoot-ing. What\u2019s the difference between this\nand rape jokes? In our society, with rape\nso prevalent, there is no such thing as a\ncontext that\u2019s removed from rape. Until rape has stopped completely, it\u2019s not\n\u201cjust a joke.\u201d\nKeir Little\n\n"
