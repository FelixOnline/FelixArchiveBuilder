Not too\nmuch of a thought, however, because it\nwas interrupted by a stewardess bringing me my lunch. The journey almost\nseemed too luxurious a preface to a\nweek\u2019s walking in the mountains; I felt\nmuch more at home when changing\nonto my bus in Aberdeen, and I was\ngreeted by a fish and chip shop connoisseur of a bus driver with the words:\n\u201cBraemar? What the **** do you want\nto go there for?\u201d Welcome to Scotland.\nI was made to feel much more welcome when I rounded the corner into\nBraemar Lodge to discover the group\nstill unloading the minibus. There\nwere a few surprised faces at my unannounced arrival, but after locating the\nonly free bunk, I soon settled into an\nevening of wishing I\u2019d stopped at a supermarket to buy some beer.\nBright and early on Sunday morn-ing, it was time to get stuck into some\nMunros. First up were the twin peaks\nof North Top and South Top, although not before a long traipse along\na snowed over Landie track \u2013 something that would later develop into a\ntheme of the week. Our first ascent\nbegan, and after a brief delay for Dave\nto change up his shorts for his trousers,\nand another brief delay for Dave to add\nthermals under his trousers, we broke\nthrough the cloud and onto a beautiful plateau. North Top proved a challenging find on the lunar landscape,\nbut Alex\u2019s stellar navigation guided us\nto our first Munro of the week, and all\nwithout anybody falling off a cliff or\nbeing caught in an avalanche. A quick\ntrek back across the Moon and South\nTop was also ours.\nOur descent was sped up consider-ably, at least for some, by the frequent\ndeployment of essential safety equip-ment. Unfortunately, all this time was\nthen lost to The First Great Snowfight. Small skirmishes had been taking place all the way down the hill, and\nthings gradually escalated until snowballs the size of beach balls were being\nexchanged, despite constant threats\nfrom the resident schoolma\u2019am that\n\u201cwe would be in so much trouble\u201d. Not\nlong later, we were trudging back to the\nminibus through the snow.\nBack in the hut, Jim and Peter treated us to a delicious Sunday roast, full\ntrimmings included, and there was\nmuch rejoicing. Despite our efforts,\nwe didn\u2019t quite manage to finish every-thing; after all, \u201cthere\u2019s no need to ram\nmeat down your throat just for the sake\nof it\u201d, right?\nEarly nights followed for most of the\ngroup, except for the dedicated team of\ndessert designers who worked into the\nearly hours creating The Beast.\nForged from every imaginable in-gredient, The Beast was a four-layered\nmonstrosity of heart disease waiting to\nhappen. Weighing in at approximately\ntwenty kilos, it was unlike anything\nwe\u2019d ever seen in a kitchen, and it\nhadn\u2019t even left the pot yet. That would\nhave to wait for a day of settling.\nSunrise on Monday greeted us with\ntraditional Scottish weather, or at least\nit would have done, had the traditional\nScottish weather not obscured it. Carn\na Tuirc was our goal, and undeterred\nby the wind, the rain, and the complete\nabsence of any shelters marked on the\nmap, we headed up.\nThe view from the summit was non-existent, so we stayed only to argue\nbriefly about our next destination, and\nwhich way it was, before setting off for\nCairn of Claise. Once again, we managed a whole day without anybody falling off the many available cliffs. Morale\ndropped considerably on the descent,\nuntil finally we dropped out of the\ncloud and the minibus came into view,\nalthough still several hundred metres\nbelow us. Thankfully, our trusty survival bags were once again at hand to\nspeed our descent. Stopping only to\ndiscuss the possibilities of multiple\nroadkill rabbits as dinner, we headed\nback to to town to see what Braemar\nhad to offer.\nAside from whisky, walking equipment and woollen clothing, Braemar\ndoes not offer much, so our time would\nmostly be split between the single pub\nand a delicious-looking takeaway, The\nHungry Highlander, that served the\nbest of world cuisine: Fish and chips,\npizzas and kebabs.\nAfter a quick trip to the pub, we returned to the bunkhouse to discover\nthat the Beast was about to be unveiled\nin all its glory. A ten minute struggle\nensued, after which we finally managed\nto release it from the pot, and it sat in\nthe middle of the dining table challenging us to finish it \u2013 or even start it!\nThe top layer was a milk chocolate\nand marshmallow affair, followed by a\nlayer of white chocolate and brownie\nclusters. Below that, the cereals kicked\nin, with one layer of rice krispies and\ntoffee and another of cornflakes. The\nwhole thing was almost six inches\nhigh, and nearly two feet in diameter.\nEating it all this week would be quite\na challenge...\n\u2026 a challenge we got stuck straight\ninto as soon as we\u2019d finished our chili\npasta. Perhaps ambitiously, we set ourselves the target of eating a quarter\nevery night, and dished portions out\namongst the group accordingly. Some\ncomplained they were being served\ntoo little, some too much, but nearly\nall of us were soon stifled by the sheer\nsweetness of the dessert. Throughout a whole evening of the traditional\ngame Werewolf, and some of its less-er-known variants, we struggled to\nfinish the culinary task we\u2019d assigned\nourselves.\nNo walking was planned for Tuesday, so we seized the opportunity for\na lie in with both pillows and stayed\nin bed until the decadent time of eight\no\u2019clock, when I walked into town to\nbuy pancakes, satisfying myself that\nI had made my culinary contribution\nfor the week, and leaving the preparation in the much more capable hands\nof Jen, who did not disappoint. Well\nstuffed, we headed off to Balmoral\nto see the Queen. Unfortunately, the\nQueen wasn\u2019t in (kind of her to tell us),\nso we just had a poke around her house\ninstead, and then strolled around her\noversize garden.\nSecretly, I\u2019m sure everybody was\ncounting down the minutes until our\ndistillery tour began. Jim, James, Peter\nand I even found a mini hill to climb,\nalthough despite our best efforts, we\nfailed to get lost.\nRoyal Lochnagar did not disappoint!\nOur tour guide survived most of Joe\u2019s\ntechnical questions, and provided us\nwith plenty to taste at the end. She\nseemed very keen for us to know that\nRoyal Lochnagar are now owned and\noperated by Diageo, so it would be\ncriminal of me not to further her cause\nby leaving out that essential factoid.\nThis being my first time, I discovered\nhow water and barley become hango-vers, and I gather that even the seasoned whiskey tourists learnt a thing\nor two.\nOnce again, we\nmanaged a whole\nday without anybody falling off\nthe many available\ncliffs.\nfelix FRIDAY 28 MAY 2010\n...we evaded the\nwerewolves, and\nthe Russian spies\nwho were camped\nout in the vicinity.\nCome Spring, the Hiking Club migrates to warmer lands\nHiking Club\ndiscover the\nbeast within\n\n"

Well, you have to give it to them;\nthe title is catchy and certainly opens\nthe doors to much media-loved bickering between discerning parties. But\nwhat is this buzz all about?\nTo explain: Cells are the basic units\nof life and DNA is essentially their\nsoftware. This fairly simple molecule\ncontains a code in the form of four\nchemical bases that the cell decodes\nto synthesise proteins and enzymes,\nwhich in turn regulate cell behaviour.\nEasy.\nWhat Venter\u2019s team did was to take\nsmall fragments of this DNA, identical\nto \u2018natural\u2019 DNA but synthesised by a\nmachine, and paste them in increasingly big fragments. The final product was\na slightly modified copy of the genome\nof a bacterium (the donor), which they\ninserted into a close relative bacterium\n(the host). The modified host showed\nthe same characteristics as the donor,\nshowing that DNA really controls cell\nidentity (\u2026 surprise?).\nWhile some claim that Venter is\nplaying God, it seems to me that he is\na mere counterfeiter, simply trying to\nphotocopy an incredible painting. The\ntrue achievement of this work is in the\npractical realisation of the task, which\nexpected. We now have a slightly different picture of how life at its basics\nworks. It is not a simple chain that\nlinks DNA to protein, and consequently protein to function, but rath-er, it is a very complex network with\nmany branching points, loops and\ninterconnections.\nThis is a problem at two levels. First\nof all, we have not yet mastered the art\nof creating new proteins because we\nare missing some of the information\naround a bit.\nThis highly laborious technique,\nwhilst providing an alternative to traditional methods in which we simply deleted or added genes, has the\npotential to become a valuable tool\nfor things such as the production of\nmedicines and the treatment of pol-lutants, and it has helped develop the\nfield of \u2018Synthetic Biology\u2019. At present\nhowever, we seem to be incredibly far\nfrom being able to \u201cdesign\u201d a cell from\nscratch. This poses the question; why\nnot use the well-designed and nature-tested models that we presently have\nas a scaffold? \u201cIt will eventually come\nin useful\u201d appears to be the only possible answer at present, even though\nit is hard to imagine the supporters of\nthe $40m funding being happy enough\nwith that...\nWhilst some people are concerned\nwith the risk of this method being\nused to manufacture new biochemical weapons, in light of what has been\ndescribed above, it does not appear as\nthough we are in more danger than we\never were before. After all, who would\nchoose a new, more expensive, more\ncomplicated and troublesome technique when current techniques are\nmore than sufficient?\nCraig Venter\u2019s work is revolutionary\nin the sense that now we can play with\neven bigger DNA fragments, and that\nthe synthesised DNA appears to be as\ngood as the \u2018natural\u2019 DNA. The creation of new methods is always a prerequisite for their optimisation and\nfurther developments, thus leading to\nlower costs, and so making them more\nwidely available.\nHowever, in this case it looks like the\nprogress of the \u201cartificial cell\u201d will not\nbe limited by the improvement of tech-niques, but rather by the increased understanding in the field of biology and\nbiochemistry which requires much\nmore effort.\nWithout an understanding of the\nnetwork DNA-protein-function, we\nare simply going to keep photocopying\npaintings.\nE\nvery now and again there\u2019s a\npiece of news that just leaves\nyou stood wondering in\namazement. Something that\nwithin one fell swoop can lift you to\nanother realm of conciousness and\ntotally transform your viewpoint in a\npositive manner. Dr Venter would like\nhis creation of the \u2018artificial cell\u2019 to be\none of these moments in time. However, it quite simply is not. Just forget it.\nThe research published in Science\nlast week titled \u201cCreation of a Bacterial Cell Controlled by a Chemically\nSynthesized Genome\u201d is a fine piece\nof work. As Carla explains, it is a feat\nof technical brilliance to be able to implant chemically synthesised DNA into\nan existing \u2018shell\u2019 of a cell (i.e. all the\ncomponents of the cell including the\norganelles and enzymes) that has had\nits DNA removed and to then \u2018re-boot\u2019\nthe system using this implanted DNA.\nIt is a technical breakthrough, but then\nso too is a lot of the research coming\nout of research institutions every week.\nCreating life can surely only be a\nclaim made legitimately once the entire cell and its components are synthesised from scratch using a man-made\nDNA construct? Rather than having a\nload of the hard work already done for\nyou? This idea is a remote possibility\nand is something a million miles away\nWhat\u2019s all this\nabout then?\nNathanLey\nNathanLey Science Editor\nscaremongering, hyperbolic article\nalongside an interview with our very\nown Lord Robert Winston, who very\ngently and calmly put us all back in our\nplace.\nSo, in simple terms, the research\nitself is nothing to worry about, and\nneither are the possibilites and likely\napplications that eventually come out\nof it. What is more disturbing is something else slightly more hidden.\nThis week Prof John Sulston (a Nobel\nPrize winner for his work mapping the\nhuman genome, so you might expect\nhim to know what he\u2019s talking about)\ngave a slightly more cynical view on\nthe issue, claiming that Craig Venter\nwas seeking to create a monopoly with\ngenetic engineering techniques. He\nmade his claims on BBC Radio 4 whilst\ndismissing the research as nothing\nmore than a \u201cpretty little experiment\u201d\nstating that \u201cthey are using this experiment to claim an enormous range of\npossibilities which really would give\nthem control of all bioengineering in\nthe future\u201d. He continued: \u201cit seems to\nme that this is exactly the sort of thing\nthat we don\u2019t want the patent system\nto do\u201d.\nThese are worries shared amongst\nthe wider scientific community, but\nit is both easy and difficult to be too\nskeptic. On the one hand, we have a\nchauvanistic individual who clearly\nknows how to play the media, and\nwho may partake in slightly dubious\ncollaborations with cloudy motives (a\n$600M deal wth ExxonMobil having\nrecently been announced). But on the\nother hand, this is the same individual\nwho brought us shotgun sequencing\nand the completion of the human genome project.\nThe motivations of his research\nnotably include the possibilities that\nwork could be put towards advanced\nbiofuels, new vaccines and medicines.\nThese are wholesome and worthy\naims to have, and so on the surface\ngiven his achievements to date thus far\nalong with the power at his command,\nCraig Venter is clearly an important\nindividual.\nAs humans we are, generally speak-ing, all for innovation and creativity,\nespecially in the name of discovery.\nBut so too should we be for regulation and control over the bodies and\nindividuals that oversee the important\nwork on some of the most pressing issues society faces today.\n\u201cThese are worries\nshared amongst\nthe scientific\ncommunity, but it\nis both easy and\ndifficult to be too\nskeptic\u201d\nScanning electron micrograph of M. mycoides JCVI-syn1\nprobably took the word \u201ctroubleshooting\u201d to a whole new level. This\nproject, started more than 10 years ago\nwith a reported cost of $40m, has been\ntermed by some as a \u201cscientific landmark\u201d. But is it really? At first sight,\nthere are already quite a few problems;\nto understand why, we need to go back\na few years.\nWhen the race for the Genome Sequences started, we had the hope that,\nupon its completion, we would literally unlock the secret to life. While it\nbecame an incredibly useful tool, the\nresults were not as self-explanatory as\non how the sequence of a protein leads\nto a particular function (i.e. from the\nsequence of the protein alone we can\ndeduce very little and we are missing\nthe sequence-function relationship).\nSecondly, we can only try to understand the end product, i.e. a living cell,\nby examining the network or the interactions at the protein level, something\nwhich takes time, and which we are\nstill working towards.\nThis means that at present we cannot \u201cwrite\u201d a new code that will create\na new cell but we can simply play with\nwhat Nature has given us, tweaking\nDr Craig Venter, leader of the team to create the \u2018artificial cell\u2019\nfrom the stage we are currently at, and\nconsequently unthinkable at this moment in time.\nThe standard mainstream reaction\ntowards this research has been driven\nby the apparent fear that soon, this line\nof enquiry and technical expertise will\nmake it possible for scientists to create\nfully fledged organismal life and commit acts tantamount to the \u2018work of\nGod\u2019.\nNow, I\u2019ve already aired my irritation about the usage of the phrase \u2018act\nof God\u2019 relating to insurance claims,\nand it should come as no suprise that\nall this discussion of \u2018playing God\u2019 is\nequally as unappealing to me. Will\nwe ever reach a point in time where\ntabloids and news outlets can report\non stories without resorting to such\ntasteless tactics? Nevermind that the\nconcept of a \u2018God\u2019 is very much open\nfor debate. Credit where credit is due\nthough, The Sun ran their standard\n\n"

The Complete University Guide 2011 published in the THE\nIndependent ranks the University 3rd\nnationally behind usual one-two duo\nOxford and Cambridge respectively.\nThe highest placed London-based\nuniversity behind Imperial is the\nLondon School of Economics in 5th\nplace. University College London,\npreviously placed 4th in the world\naccording to the Times Higher Education-QS World University Rankings 2009 (ahead of Imperial in 5th),\nis now ranked 9th nationally.\nAlongside an overall ranking of\nUniversities, the Complete University Guide also provides subject\nspecific rankings, throughout which\nImperial also placed strongly. The\nUniversity scored highly across the\nsciences, placing 1st nationally for\nCivil Engineering and 2nd for Materials, Mechanical Engineering and\nChemical Engineering.\nThe student satisfaction ratings\nlisted by the Guide also exhibit some\nsurprising developments. Imperial\u2019s\nstudent satisfaction, notorious in\nthe past for being comparatively low\namongst the top Universities of the\ncountry and especially in London, is,\naccording to the Guide, higher than\nthat of LSE and not far behind UCL\nand King\u2019s College London.\nThis University league table will, if\nanything, be likely to bolster Imperial\u2019s already well regarded position\namongst both the public and potential employers. While the University\nleague table will give those hiring\ngraduates an overview of Imperial\u2019s\ncredibility, the specific subject tables\nare likely to be even more influential for future employers in specialist\nfields such as engineering.\nHowever, some continue to criticise the use of league tables, citing\nbias towards better funded and older\ninstitutions as a significant flaw in\nthe system. Indeed, in Imperial\u2019s case,\nscience and engineering degrees require greater research income and\nultimately provide more employable\ngraduates than a University running\nboth science and arts courses.\nThe Russell Group, of which Imperial is a member, receives two thirds\nof research grant and contract funding in the UK, thereby elevating the\ntwenty Universities who are part of\nthe group above the others with its\ngreater wealth.\nOn the other hand, this latest survey appears to suggest that this bias\nis being overturned, with newer institutions such as the University of\nHertfordshire (rising four places this\nyear to 41st) fighting back against\nolder and more traditional counter-parts. In addition to the rise in student satisfaction, this goes some way\ntowards justifying Imperial\u2019s continued steady and impressive position\nacross the league tables year after\nyear.\nMatt Colvin\nMatt Colvin\nThe University of Oxford tops the list of highly-achieving universities in the UK\nImperial still \u2018best of the rest\u2019\nAssistant Editors\nJovan Nedi\u0107\nCharlotte Morris\nNews Editor\nKadhim Shubber\nNews Reporters\nRox Middleton\nJoanna Cai\nAlex Karapetian\nAlice Rowlands\nLayout Editors\nCarlos Karingal\nHolly Farrer\nOnline Editors\nRavi Pall\nChris Birkett\nBusiness Editor\nSina Ataherian\nInternational Editor\nTom Greany\nFilm Editor\nEd Knock\nTechnology Editor\nSamuel Gibbs\nSports Editors\nMustapher Botchway\nDavid Wilson\nIndy Leclercq\nFashion Editors\nKawai Wong\nSaskia Verhagen\nMusic Editors\nKadhim Shubber\nAlex Ashford\nLuke Turner\nComment Editors\nRavi Pall\nCharlotte Morris\nScience Editors\nBrigette Atkins\nNathan Ley\nWhat\u2019s On Editor\nZiggi Szafranski\nArts Editors\nCaz Knight\nRosie Milton\nLucy Harrold\nPolitics Editors:\nJames Goldsack\nKatya-yani Vyas\nJames Lees\nTravel Editor\nDylan Lowe\nCoffee Break Editor\nCharles Murdoch\nPuzzles Captain\nSean Farres\nPhotography\nBen Smith\nAlex Karapetian\nCatnip Editor\nRhys Davies\nClubs and Socs Editor\nAlex Kendall\nFeature Editor\nAfonso Campos\nMarco Couch\nVictoria Brzezinski\nRox Middleton\nMatt Colvin\nLizzy Griffiths\nAyyub Kamaludin\nJamie Beal\nRichard Howard\nStefan Zeeman\nEditor-in-Chief\nDan Wan\nEditor-in-Prowling\nKadhim Shubber\nDeputy Editor\nGilead Amit\nCopy Chief\nSasha Nicoletti\nUniversity of Oxford\nUniversity of Cambridge\nImperial College London\nUniversity of Durham\nLondon School of Economics\nUniversity of St. Andrews\nUniversity of Warwick\nUniversity of Lancaster\nUniversity College London\nUniversity of York\nThe Complete University Guide 2010\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n(1)\n(2)\n(3)\n(5)\n(4)\n(7)\n(6)\n(12)\n(8)\n(10)\nThe sun\u2019s out, the casts are off.\nT\nhe summer officially arrived in London this week.

Well dear reader, let me introduce you to the wonder that is the Haldane Collection. The Haldane used to be awesome, situated in what is now\nthe Level 1 Computer Room in the library. I\u2019d spend most lunchtimes sat on the comfy chairs reading a newspaper or perusing the DVD collection for something to\nwatch that night. The Haldane Collection has now moved (minus the comfy chairs and newspapers) to the stifling heat of Level 5. Culture, amongst our very own.\nDVDs\nIf you\u2019re into opera, you\u2019ll love the library\u2019s DVD collection- it\u2019s Verdi\nand Puccini heaven. If you don\u2019t like your singing quite so..erm\u2026 loud\nthen it\u2019s a bit less fun.\nRocky Horror\nPicture Show\nMaybeoneforafterexams\nbut it is a must see for\nanyone who\u2019s ever seen\na guy wandering down\nthe street in fishnets\nand suspenders and\nthought WTF?

The\nsongs are catchy, the story\nis absolutely ridiculous.\nYou may find yourself\ndeveloping affections for\nmen in suspenders...\nMacBeth\nThis\nproduction\nstarring theatre\nlegends Ian\nMcKellen and\nJudi Dench is the\ndefinitive version\nof \u2018The Scottish\nPlay\u2019. Performed\nwithout costumes\nor complex sets the\ntext is the star of the\nshow, really getting\nback to the purpose\nof Shakespeare as an\nart form, not a tool to\nbore schoolchildren.\nCDs\nThe library has the strangest collection of CDs, I\u2019ve even spotted Louise Redknapp\u2019s\nonly solo offering. But we\u2019re going to narrow the search to theatre generally\nbecause a) That\u2019s my favourite subject and b) I think I must have taken out most of\nthe CDs in the eclectic collection.\nCompany\nAmazingly, the library has\na rare rendering of the\n1995 Donmar Warehouse\nproduction of Company\nstarring Hustle\u2019s Adrian\nLester. Company centres\naround Bobby on his 35th birthday\nas his friends around him grow up and\nget married, Bobby is left cynical and\nyearning for a relationship of his own. A\ncurious version of the show featuring a\npredominantely black cast and imagining\nBobby as a cocaine addict.\nSong highlights include Ladies Who\nLunch: Witty mentions of Mahler, hats\nand all those girls we love to hate; and\nBeing Alive which is the ultimate male\nballad (well maybe except for Jesus\nChrist Superstar\u2019s Gethsename).

Sally\nhas lost everything \u2013 her man, her\nlivelihood, her baby and possibly\nher life. When done properly, it\u2019s\nheartbreaking.\nBooks\nRagtime\nI must admit I\u2019ve taken this book out a fair few times but now\nhave my own copy so you can read it instead. Ragtime is the tale\nof three families in turn of the century New York. An upper class\nwhite family in New Rochelle, a black couple from Harlem and an\nimmigrant family from Latvia. E.L.

    "content": "11\nfelix FRIDAY 28 MAY 2010\nscience.felix@imperial.ac.uk SCIENCE\nGeomorphometric techniques take us back in time\nS\nhe sits alone. Much like\nHamlet, Dr Williams beholds\na skull - poring over every\ndetail. Yet this skull does not\nbelong to the fictional jester.\nIt is the face of a young child. Her time\nwith the specimen is not a fleeting lament but a laborious and emotionally\ntaxing study. But unlike the tragedy\u2019s\nprotagonist, Dr Williams is not left\nwith sadness but with hope.\nPreviously forensic scientists have\nencountered difficulty in identifying\nthe remains of children. It has been\nthought that distinct features do not\nmanifest themselves in the bone until\nadulthood. But Dr Williams of the University of Florida believed otherwise.\n\u201cThe skull, is endlessly fascinating,\nas so many features which define the\nway in which we are perceived in the\nworld are etched into its surface. For\ninstance, clues to a person's sex, and\nancestry are imprinted on bone itself.\nWith minimal equipment, keen eye-sight, training, and perseverance many\nof these secrets can be uncovered\u201d.\nAnd they were. Using \u2018geometric\nmorphometric\u2019 (GM) techniques, Dr\nWilliams studied the skulls of 50 children and adults. It involved \u2018collecting data by applying a probe attached\nto the mechanical arm of a piece of\nequipment called a digitizer to various\npoints on the skull.\u2019 Single 3D points\nwere then mapped and compared\nacross different age groups. The findings were exciting, as Dr Williams re-calls. \u201cOur results found no significant\ndifferences in between the teens and\nyoung adults, indicating adulthood is\nreached earlier in the skull than commonly thought.\u201d\nFor forensic scientists this means\none thing - techniques used to identify\nadult skulls can also be applied to older\nchildren.\nThe hope extends further. Children\nof the past and of past civilisations can\nnow be analysed whereas before, their\nancestry and sex were not attempted\nto be determined. The study\u2019s results\nwere later applied to a 10 year old boy\nwho was found to be of Mesoamerican\norigin. Ancestral identifications could\nhelp investigators with facial recon-structions. Perhaps even one day GM\ncould help bring closure to the families\nof missing children.\nDr Williams does not doubt the\npower of GM. \u201cI am confident GM will\nbecome more commonplace in forensic analyses. There is no doubt that the\nprocess can be tedious, but the final\noutcome makes it well worth it.\u201d\nSo while Hamlet will forever ponder\nthe great questions of life and death,\nDr Williams is providing answers and\na glimmer of hope for what are essentially stories of tragedy. And after clo-sure, I hope that for these children and\ntheir families the rest is silence.\nShupaula Dass reveals a new technique has been developed to allow identification of the remains of children\nIs this the dagger I see before me ... oh wait, wrong one\nOne of the three \u2018Southside\u2019 halls of residence\nhousing around 120 undergraduate students\nover 7 floors.

My personal favourite is when people choose to\nwhisper thinking that I will not hear them because they are\nsat across from me and that the laws of physics dictate that\nsound does not carry that far.

    "content": "23\nfelix FRIDAY 28 MAY 2010\nclubs&socs.felix@imperial.ac.uk C & S\nfelix\nA quick stop at the supermarket\nfor some, and a quick stop at the pub\nfor others, was necessary on the way\nhome, where we settled down to try\nout all the whiskey we\u2019d been coaxed\ninto buying at Royal Lochnagar. Our\nlocal culinary experts once again excelled with a risotto, followed, as\nusual, by Beast. Unusually, however,\ntonight\u2019s serving of Beast contained\nsome unpleasant surprises: My slice in\nparticular seemed to have an unusually high onion content. The shocking\ncombined flavour of onion and marshmallow forced me to retreat from the\nkitchen, tail between my legs, and not\nreturn for the rest of the night.\nWednesday would bring us the marquee walk of the trip: Cairngorm and\nBen Macdui \u2013 the second highest peak\nin the UK. Not satisfied with only the\ntwo Munros, Alex had also hatched a\nsecret plan for the more adventurous\ngroup members to take in another pair\nand walk most of the way back to Braemar from Aviemore. However, before\nwe did any walking, we\u2019d have to negotiate the sixty mile drive to Cairngorm\nSki Centre. With a long walk ahead, we\nwere taunted all the way up the first\nascent by the sight of skiers the other\nside of the fence, enjoying the snow\nthat was making our lives so difficult.\nTwenty minutes in, Anna, Joe, Peter\nand I could no longer resist the temp-tation, and, ignoring the disdainful\nglares, we returned to the base station\nto rent equipment, buy lift passes and\nenjoy the Easter snow.\nWhile we were wasting our day frolicking around with gravity, Alex, Jim,\nJames, Gavin, Jiri and Eva set off on\ntheir marathon hike, heading from Ben\nMacdui over to Carn A\u2019mhaim. After\na pitched battle with some wandering\norcs at the summit, they slew three\ndragons along the river back to Braemar, and would have hiked all the way\nhome had Rafal not intercepted them\nwith the bus.\nAlthough, I wasn\u2019t there, so I can\u2019t be\ncertain. They might have exaggerated\nthings a bit.\nThe next day arrived with a curious mixture of slackers\u2019 fresh legs\nand hikers\u2019 stiff legs, but nothing like\nthat would deter us from upping our\nMunro count. We set off early to Beinn\nBhreac, along a route spied by Alex on\nyesterday\u2019s return. After another prolonged track trek, we set off into the\nwilderness past a house that looked\nsuspiciously reminiscent of Dog Soldiers. This was too much for James\nand Dave, who soon after decided that\nthey\u2019d be much safer in the minibus,\nand disappeared back down the track\nto hide. Once we\u2019d evaded the were-wolves, and the Russian spies who\nwere, for no apparent reason, camped\nout in the vicinity, we began to climb\nup to the peak of Beinn Bhreac. At\nleast, we thought it was the peak, but\nour celebrations were cut short by\nAlex\u2019s announcement that actually\nthe real peak was further over to the\nEast, and was a phenomenal four metres higher. So off we tramped through\nthe wind until we reached the summit,\nwhen we decided that it was too windy,\nand that we should all lie down behind\nthe cairn for a nap.\nRefreshed, we began to head home,\ntaking a detour to take in a gorge that\napparently \u2018looked nice from the map\u2019.\nWe were lured in by the promised of\npicturesque scenery to admire while\nenjoying our lunch. Along the ridge,\nwe were blessed with amazing views of\nsome of the week\u2019s earlier walks, which\nwa s good, because the gorge itself was\ndisappointingly quarrylike. No matter,\nmorale was high on this bright sunny\nday as we made good pace home.\nThe car park presented us with an\ninteresting distraction in the form of a\nbiotoilet, which as far as I could tell, is\nsimply a toilet with fewer moving parts\nand many more instructions: so many,\nthat quite a queue formed just because\nwe all took the time to read them.\nWe arrived back in Braemar relatively early, which offered us an opportunity to head into town and remind\nourselves that there wasn\u2019t much there.\nA local tea room provided a welcome\nchange of scenery from the bunkhouse,\nhowever, and much entertainment and\ndiscussion of child labour laws when a\nsix-year-old child came to collect our\ndirty crockery at closing time. Another\ndelicious dinner, this time haggis, was\nfollowed by nervous servings of Beast,\nwith much poking to find any stray\nslices of cheese or onion that may have\nsneaked in.\nOur final day was scheduled to be\nlong one: a 28 kilometre circuit taking\nin a measly five Munros. Early starts\nwere required, including some last-minute packing for the one person\nwho had to ruin everything by leaving\na night early.\nUncharacteristically, this walk allowed us to get immediately stuck in to\nthe climb; no flat tracks would eat up\nour morning today. We were headed\nfor Lochnagar, a beautiful lake beneath\nbeautiful cliffs that gives its name to\nthe whiskey produced at Tuesday\u2019s\ndistillery. Up in the snow on a clear\nday, we had breathtaking views of the\nCairngorm National Park and of all\nour week\u2019s walking, and mid-morning\nwe hit our first Munro, Cac Carn Beag.\nOnce we\u2019d arrived at this summit, the\nhighest of the day, we had also completed nearly all our ascent, so we took\nsome time out for photographs and\nsnacks, interspersed with some final\nlast-day snowballing for those of us\nwho still hadn\u2019t tired of it.\nCarn a\u2019 Choire Bhoidheach and Carn\na t-Sagairt M\u00f2r soon also fell to our relentless boots, although the third surprised us with a lone aircraft wing resting near the top. Dave\u2019s aeronautical\nengineering training let him down as\nhe failed to identify it from a sole wing,\nbut through the wonders of mobile internet we identified it as a RAF Canberra, WJ615, from all the way back\nin 1956, which unfortunately collided\nwith the mountain after overshooting\na night-time landing nearby.\nOn we hiked, with some of the group\nmaking the most of the last of the\nweek\u2019s survival bagging opportunities\nin the snow (some of us had been issued new bags and were forbidden\nfrom unwrapping them).\nWe soon reached Cairn Bannoch,\nand pressed on to Broad Cairn \u2013 with\nfewer than a hundred metres of descent and ascent between peaks, the\ngoing was not tough, and at the top we\ntook some time to survey our day\u2019s impressive accomplishments. That was\nthe end of our climbing for the week.\nIt was not the end of our walking,\nhowever: we still had nine kilometres\nOur final day was\nscheduled to be a\nlong one: a 28km\ncircuit of five\nmountains.\ndown to and along the side of Dubh\nLoch, along some tight, steep tracks.\nAs we neared the water, Alex became\nincreasingly nervous, obviously aware\nof Dave\u2019s plans to enact the \u2018tradition\u2019\nof submerging the trip leader, but fortunately for him we never came close\nenough to the waterside.\nPerhaps much later than some had\nexpected, we returned to the car park\nafter an impressive day, and a far more\nimpressive week\u2019s walking.\nThe end of that walk also signalled\nthe end of my time with the Fellwanderers. After an undignified change in\nthe back of the minibus, I was abandoned in Ballater to make my own\nway home. Not that I had much to\ncomplain about \u2013 my own way home\ninvolved the sleeper train down from\nAberdeen, including breakfast served\nto my cabin. Followed by Beast, of\ncourse!\nSpecial thanks go out to all the\nFellwanderers committee for a well-organised and exciting trip, Jim and\nPeter for keeping our engines running\non delicious meals, the entire group\nfor being great trip-mates, and Rafal,\nJoe and Jules for all the extra miles\nthey did in the driving seat of our\nminibus.\n\n"

    "content": "POLITICS\nPolitics Editors\nPolitics Editors James Goldsack and James Lees\nJames Goldsack and James Lees\npolitics.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n9\nfelix FRIDAY 28 MAY 2010\nI\nwas shocked after reading the\nincredibly one-sided article \u201cDo\nBrits really want electoral reform?\u201d and some of the points\nhave to be met head on.\nThis government is arguably the first\nto have legitimate authority in over\nseven decades. Yes you did read that\nright; no party in the last 70 years has\nhad more than 50% of the popular vote.\nMost people voted against Labour\u2019s famous 1997 \u2018landslide\u2019. In light of this\nit\u2019s very interesting how the writer accuses this coalition of having no right\nto push for electoral reform especially\nwhen the Liberal Democrats have had\nthat issue in their manifesto for over 20\nyears. To anyone accusing the Con-Lib\ncoalition of lacking a mandate, I say\nright back at you. Any voting system\nwould be put to a referendum anyway.\nNumerous polls have found that if\npeople thought the Liberal Democrats\ncould win in their area, their share of\nthe popular vote would rise dramati-cally. Because of things like this it\u2019s\nvery difficult and misleading to translate results from this system into another one. Voting systems affect how\npeople vote.\nThere is this extremely damaging suggestion that we should castrate our elec-Jakov Marelic\nJakov Marelic\ntoral system to keep undesirable parties\nout. \u201cPR will give power to the BNP\u201d\ncry the critics. If you took this idea to its\nlogical conclusion, you might as well not\nhave voting at all. Have the government\nbe decided by a meritocracy who know\nbetter than the common people. Under\nSingle Transferable Vote (STV), the system that Liberal Democrats proposed, a\ncandidate still needs 25% of the vote in\ntheir constituency. Nobody is arguing for\nIsrael-style PR where only 0.5% around\nthe country is enough to get a seat. Critics should stop using this strawman.\nThe childish accusation of \u201cYou only\nfavour PR because you\u2019re a small party\u201d\nis easily turned around. You only favour\nFPTP because you\u2019re a large party.\nThe writer brings up the example of\nItaly having 60 governments in 60 years,\nbut forgets to mention that Germany, for\ninstance, has had mostly coalition governments for decades and its economy is\nstronger and larger than say, the United\nKingdom. Analysis has shown that out\nof the 16 countries enjoying a triple-A\ncredit rating, 10 currently have coalition\ngovernments and 12 use some form of\nproportional representation. Far from\nproducing weak governments, PR produces ones with a clear mandate because\nthe majority of people have voted for\nthem and fewer votes are wasted.\nFirst Past The Post has created a\nclass of MPs who totally ignore their\nelectorate. Yorkshire will always vote\nLabour, South Kensington will always\nvote Conservative and MPs have ex-This\nweek\nFirst ever Con-Lib Queens Speech\nThisweeksawtheofficial\nopening of the new Parliament with the Queens\nSpeech. The new coalition government\u2019s plans\nwere set out in full with\nthe 22 bills that Cameron\nand Clegg hope to pass\nin the next year. Several\nbills focusing on small\ngovernment or big society have been proposed\nas the Conservative-Liberal alliance seeks to reverse the centralisation of power and removal of civil liberties brought in\nunder Labour. Fixed term parliaments have been pledged\nalong with a bill which should bring about the change to the\nalternative vote system. No mention of fox hunting.\nRace for the Labour leadership\nConservative back-benchers known as the\n1922 Committee have\nbeaten back Cameron\u2019s\nattempt to allow ministers to vote in their\nmeetings as ministers\nwill not be voting at\nthe election for the\nchair of the commit-tee. The 1922 committee serves as a place for Conservative backbenchers to\nexpress views not handed down from the Party leadership.\nThis allows them to serve as a vital check to the increasingly\npresidential power of the Prime Ministers position. It was responsible for the vote of no confidence which removed Iain\nDuncan-Smith from the Conservative leadership in 2003.\nBackbenchers still have power\nFollowing Gordon Brown\u2019s\nresignation, the competition for a new leader of the\nLabour party has begun.\nAny candidate wishing to\nrun has to be nominated\nby 33 Labour MPs. At the\ntime of writing Ed Milliband, the former energy\nsecretary,wasleadingwith\n41 nominations, and David\nMilliband, the former foreign secretary in second\nwith 37. Other candidates include Ed Balls , the former education secretary and Andy Burnham a backbencher. Who the\nwinner is will determine the direction the Labour party takes\ninto the next general election which will be in May 2015.\n\u201cOne of the most\nbeautiful features of\nSTV is that candidates\nfrom the same party\nhave to compete with\neach other.\u201d\nSome Brits really do want electoral reform\nFollowing \u2018Do Brits really want electoral reform?\u2019 in last week\u2019s felix, a polling polemic in favour of change\nGerman governments have often been successful coalitions in recent decades.\nploited their unaccountability to the\nhilt, as we\u2019ve seen with the expenses\nscandal. One of the most beautiful features of STV is that candidates from\nthe same party have to compete with\neach other. If your MP doesn\u2019t reply to\nyour letters, you can throw them out\nat the next election without ditching\nhis or her party. FPTP forces voters to\nchoose a candidate at the same time as\nthey choose a party; it gives power to\npoliticians instead of people. If the Conservatives really believed in free market\nforces like they claim, they should jump\nat the chance of introducing STV.\nI predict that if STV is achieved, we\nwill end up with much more choice as\nnew parties are created and older parties split. The Liberal Democrats are\nlikely to divide into Social Democrats\nand Liberals again. The Conservatives\ncould end up splitting into the more left\nCameroons and the right old Tories.\nMany little parties are likely to\nsolve the Kingmaker problem where\nsmall parties have a disproportionate\namount of power in coalitions. The\nsmall parties would be forced to compete to take on the kingmaker role and\nbefore you know it their power would\nbe significantly reduced.\nVoter turnout has been steadily\ndropping. From the 84% high in 1950\nto the most recent 64.6%, the electorate is realising their votes are wasted;\nthey don\u2019t have the power or the\nchoice. And you know what? They\u2019re\nabsolutely right.\nAnachronism and the state of democracy\nI\nt is no small wonder that electoral reform sparks such heated\ndebates. Living in what we are\nalways told is a democracy and\nthen watching as a party with\nconsiderably less than half the vote gaining a near majority doesn\u2019t seem fair.\nWith the most recent election it would\nseem the entire country managed to get\nscrewed- nobody voted for an amalgam\nof Tory and liberal policies but that is\nwhat we are now \u2018represented\u2019 by.\nHowever, if I had been offered the\nchance to vote for the new coailition\nI would have done. I think their plans\nare better than either party\u2019s manife-toes were on most issues.\nThe people who really lost this election were dyed in the wool liberals who\nspent the election campaign turning the\nConservatives into some kind of boogie\nman. Of course on a large number of\nissues the Conservatives and Liberals\npolicies overlapped making the coalition an easy option to take. A fact that\nmany liberal supporters would have noticed had they spent some time reading\nthe manifestoes rather than insulting\nTory toffs and learning the word \u2018anachronistic\u2019 to describe first past the post.\nThat truly was one of the more bizarre things about the election for me.\nSeemingly at any given opportunity,\ntelevised Liberal supporters would describe FPTP as anachronistic- I guess it\nwas in the Guardian.\nIn the end whether the electoral system changes really will be up to us all\nwhen the issue hopefully makes it to a\nreferendum. I hope the articles in felix\nwill have made you think about which\nway you will vote.\nPolitics Editor James Lees\nange\n\n"

It was probably dwarfed by iPad news. For the\nlife of me I can\u2019t understand why so\nmany people want such a gadget. It\u2019s\nthe sheer scale of interest that surprises me most! I do understand\nwhy certain individuals need to get\ngadgeted-up but these kind of sales\nare comparable to a gadget that\u2019s actually useful.\nAnyway, let\u2019s not digress, next\nthing you know we\u2019re talking about\nmanbags.\nDid I say I wasn\u2019t going to start\ntalking about shoes? I lied. I\u2019ll get\nstraight to the good stuff. High\nheels. Of course, they are a solution\nfor the vertically challenged female\nbut I propose that they are more than\nthat. Yes, they make legs look good\nbut cheerleaders\u2019 legs look good and\nthey wear trainers. And yes, heels\nlook elegant (unless they\u2019re wedges).\nBut their excellence is derived from\nthe acoustics. That\u2019s right, the clip-clop noise when walking.\nNow, even if you\u2019re a man and you\nprobably are (a man so bored he fancied reading about shoes), you will\nknow about the noise of footsteps.\nFor example, rubber soles tend to\nbe near silent (I like to sport these\naround college to keep a low-pro-file). With high heels however you\nget two sounds per footfall (when\nI walk I put heel down followed by\ntoe). However I do not claim that\nthis is the correct way to walk in\nheels as my mother never taught me\nhow. I presume that\u2019s what mothers\nare for? But all credit to her she did\nsay I looked like a camel, and as a\nresult I try to be as uncamel-like as\npossible and I\u2019ve had no complaints\nthus far.\nSo why do I like the sound of high\nheels? It is the sound of class, nothing more, nothing less. Though un-fortunately, heels are not necessarily\nthe vision of class; unless you walk\nproperly you look like a confused\nslapper. What\u2019s sad is that I\u2019m stuck\nin a vicious cycle. I don\u2019t walk well\nin heels. I don\u2019t wear heels. I don\u2019t\nget better at walking in heels. I don\u2019t\nwalk well in heels. It\u2019s a tough life, I\ncan tell you.\nTo clarify, I don\u2019t really care about\nLouis Vuitton as such, he\u2019s merely\nFrench designer. If I\u2019m going to publicise a shoe designer it\u2019s going to be\na female and a Brit, say L.K. Bennett. I adore L.K. Bennett. There\u2019s\na branch in King\u2019s Road where I try\non the shoes and come up with increasingly elaborate reasons for the\nassistants as to why I am unable to\ncomplete the purchase. I may have\nto start using other branches.\nI couldn\u2019t talk about shoes without\nmentioning FMBs. For the ignorant\nthis is a most appropriate time to\neducate you. I only recently discovered this acronym and I am feeling it\nthrough and through, having seen a\ngood friend of mine purchase some\nboots which truly matched the FM\nsentiment. Fun for all the family.\nFinally I\u2019ll touch upon bags. Bags\nare always a very controversial topic\nso I\u2019ll try not to arouse too much\nanimosity.\nI\u2019m not kidding here, bags are no\njoke when you have a lot of thingie-mebobs and nowhere to put them.\nMen\u2019s clothes are pockets galore\nand unlike women\u2019s clothing there\nare few fake pockets or pockets that\nare too small or tight so that if you\nsquish your phone in, you look decidedly asymmetrical. Let\u2019s be prac-tical. Absolute essentials for a girl\ninclude purse (usually drastically out\nof proportion to contents which puzzles me), phone (preferably in a pink\ncase but don\u2019t get me wrong, any colour glitter is also permissible), tissues (apparently it\u2019s not so uncommon for men to be with tissue these\ndays, they say hayfever, I say no need\nto make excuses I can\u2019t stand seeing\nmen cry), a book (if you\u2019re trying to\nimpress someone, be sure it falls to\nthe floor at some point), and college\nID card (unless you want to be chatted up whilst attempting to tailgate).\nThis has happened to me both whilst\nopening the door and whilst having\nthe door opened for me. Just so you\nknow, it didn\u2019t turn out to be a story\nfor the kids. Point is, check out LK\nBennett, where both bags and shoes\nare sold. Also dresses. But dresses\nare another story entirely\u2026\nPhil Sandwell has a new way to assess knowledge\n\u201c[high-heels]...\nunless ou walk\nproperly, you look\nlike a confused\nslapper\u201d\nT\nhe third term is synonymous with examination.\nRecently I decided to put\na little thought into the\nexams; not just in the usual brain-aching way, but about how I\nwould improve them.\nFirstly, I decided that their timing\nis all wrong. It has been impossible to\nescape the mini-heat wave that has recently graced the country with its rare\npresence. Even the students who have\nbecome permanent fixtures in the Library have been seen gazing lustfully\nat the Queen\u2019s Lawn, yearning for an\nopportunity to enjoy the fickle British\nweather while it lasts. So why, I ask,\nare exams held in the summer? Far\nbetter, say, to hold the exams in November or December, when students\nwill be far more motivated to revise\nand enticed into College by the warm\nbosom of free central heating. All that\nwould be required would be a small\nrescheduling of the term timetable,\nmoving lectures into August and\nputting the summer holiday in January. On second thoughts, the prospect\nof a three-month vacation spent at\nhome, in the West Country, in winter\nis a very unappealing one, as anyone\nwho has ever seen Swindon in the rain\ncan attest. A deserved break when the\nsun still shines is retrospectively far\nmore attractive.\nThe point of exams is to assess and\napply the knowledge we have supposedly gained in the previous year. Unfortunately, the traditional way to do\nthis is to sit everyone down and make\nthem take a test. Under what scenario\noutside of an exam room will you ever\nbe required to solve problems under\na time limit, and without the use of\nWikipedia? I didn\u2019t come to university\nto just know things, I want to understand them, and so I think a better test\nof understanding is required. Someone wise once said that if you can\u2019t\nexplain something to an intelligent\nten-year-old then you don\u2019t truly understand it yourself: perhaps College\nshould therefore enlist an army of\nprimary school children to judge the\nintellectual capabilities of students.\nThis might collapse, however, when\nyou have to spend several hours explaining to your examiner-child what\ndifferentiation is, let alone what use\nit is to you. Explaining your understanding to someone more qualified\nthan you would save a lot of time, but\nthe prospect of standing before one of\nmy lecturers and displaying precisely\nhow much I didn\u2019t learn from him is\none I would rather not face. Perhaps\nthree hours in the Great Hall isn\u2019t so\nbad in comparison to a personal academic firing squad.\nWorst of all, though, is that exams\ncan be really boring. While gawping at\none piece of paper in order to organise your thoughts onto a different one\nmay be the best method examination,\nI would like to see tests be modified\ninto a more accurate reflection of student life. The assessment would begin\nwith a communal nap in the lecture\ntheatre, followed by a buzzer sounding the start of the race to the Union.\nAfter a pint has been consumed you\ncan leave for the Library, where you\nwill then have to forcibly remove a\nWorld of Warcraft enthusiast from\nhis (or her... his) terminal in order to\npost an inane Face-status. You can\nleave to start your exam once someone has liked it. While I think this is\nfair test of how good a student you\nare, degrees are apparently awarded\nfor academic ability; this makes nap-ping, drinking and Facebook entirely\nextra-curricular, regardless of how\nmuch time I\u2019ve spent revising them. If\nwe wanted degrees in pissing around\nwe would all be studying English; it\nlooks like the dullness is here to stay,\nand rightly so.\nLike death and the taxman, exams\nare a necessary evil. Despite their\nshortcomings, several hours of procrastination have not yet led me to\na way in which they could be noticeable improved, and nor will several\ninevitable hours more. I think exams\nare a lot like injections: unpleasant,\nsadistic and terrifying, but they\u2019re\nover quickly probably good for me in\nthe long term. And hopefully I\u2019ll only\nhave to have each one once.\nBloodyMaryis all handbags and gladrags\n\u201cI didn\u2019t come to\nuniversity to just\nknow things, I\nwant to understand\nthem...\u201d\n\n"

    "content": "19\nfelix FRIDAY 28 MAY 2010\nARTS\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nWhy I Like... Judy Garland\nRosannah Elsbury tells us about the studios\u2019 darling, her short-lived career and dark personal life\nO\nn the tenth of June 1922\nin the little town of\nGrand Rapids, Minnesota, a baby girl named\nFrancis Ethel Gumm\npopped out of a very disgruntled Mrs\nEthel Gumm.\nAs has been recorded countless\ntimes throughout the late 20th centu-ary, this little girl grew up to be none\nother than Judy Garland.\nLittle Francis was the youngest of\nthree girls, thanks to their mother\u2019s\nceaseless pushing and vicarious living\nthey became known in the vaudeville\nworld, imaginatively enough, as \u201cThe\nGumm Sisters\u201d\nMary Jane \u201cSuzy\u201d Gumm and Dorothy Virginia \u201cJimmie\u201d Gumm made\nthe larger part of the trio and it soon\nbecame apparent that, whilst the two\nolder sisters could sing and dance as\nwell as anybody else, they were no\nmatch for the bizzare gimmick of a\nvery little girl belting out a song like a\nseasoned alto with a megaphone.\nAt some point it dawned on the\nGumm sisters that their name provoked a certain amount of hilarity in\nthe audience and so after due consideration they changed the name from\n\u201cGumm\u201d to \u201cGarland\u201d Francis then\nchanged her name to Judy after a popular Hoagy Carmichael song.\nJudy shot to fame as Dorothy Gale in\n\u201cThe Wizard of Oz\u201d, she later went on\nto star in many popular musicals such\nas \u201cMeet Me in St Louis\u201d, where she\nmet her future husband and father of\nher first child, Vincent Minelli.\nDespite adoring Judy and fathering\nfuture musical star Liza Minelli, Vincent was a renowned homosexual, a\ntrend that was to continue in many of\nGarland\u2019s marriages.\nAfter her success in \u201cMeet Me in St\nLouis\u201d, Judy\u2019s life started to go downhill.\nAfter filming the box office flop \u201cThe\nPirate\u201d, Ms Garland suffered a nervous\nbreakdown and was promptly escorted\nto a private mental institution.\nAfter a few weeks she was released\nand went back to her hectic film sched-ule. Unfortunately Judy was still very\nunwell and was unable to complete the\nfilming of \u201cThe Berkelys of Broadway\u201d\nand was replaced by Ginger Rogers.\nJudy suffered with these bouts of depression and nervous anxiety throughout her life, she was famously troubled,\nrarely sober, pumped full of speed to\nmake her more productive and skinny I love The Wizard of Oz, here is Judy in her most famous role as Dorothy Gale\nand bullied to within and inch of her\nlife by the studio chiefs, Judy, unsur-prisingly became a very insecure and\nirrational person.\nCan you imagine what it would have\nbeen like to work with her? Granted\nshe was reportedly a true luvvy to her\nco-stars, but she was very unpredictable and suffered with her nerves. They\nnever knew if she would fly off the han-dle, lose consciousness or even just not\ncome out of her dressing room.\nUndoubtedly this lady is a legend of\nboth stage and screen, a dazzling siren\nwith the face of an innocent little girl\nand a leather-tough, husky and emotive voice, but an insecure, unpredictable mess off camera or stage.\nThe astonishing thing is that, despite this, everyone she ever worked\nwith has always said what a wonderful\nperson she was. There is rarely a bad\nword spoken about her in interviews,\nperhaps she couldn\u2019t help it and maybe\nher good points outshone her bad ones\nso much that the bad was forgotten,\nbut next time you hear her praises being sung, spare a thought for all those\nwho had to support her through the\ntough times, and watch her soak up the\npraise in the good times.\nA\ns a roving arts corre-spondent, I took it upon\nmyself this week to make\nthe intrepid expedition all\nthe way to the V&A. Yes,\nI realise I\u2019m not going to win any points\nfor originality, and this is not the cutting edge of contemporary alternative\nculture, but it\u2019s very much easier to do\nvery little work on getting in the good\nstuff.\nAnyway, this is a proper reason to go\nto the V&A, since we\u2019re so generally\noblivious to the everyday breathtaking\nglory of its permanent exhibits; there\u2019s\nan exhibition (opened 1 May) \u2018til 23\nJune of prints by Dali, Picasso, Matisse\nand Warhol. How\u2019s that for an eyeful?\nYes, seventy-five years covering the self\nproclaimed \u201cbirth of the modern age\u201d\nin one easy exhibition. Not only that,\nbut this exhibition is just two rooms!\nFor efficiency, it doesn\u2019t get much better than this.\nThe two rooms are each divided into\ntwo sections, half for each artist, and a\ngood range of prints to display a range\nof their respective styles and variation.\nThese are not the paintings but prints,\nwhich doesn\u2019t really sound so impres-sive, until you realise the huge importance of lithography in the oeuvres of\nall four great artists.\nLithography is merely a type of\nprinting but specifically one in which\na smooth stone or metal plate is used\nto create the print, rather than wood\nblock, intaglio or letterpress printing\nwhich is \u2018potato-print\u2019 style.\nThe image is made by drawing the\ndesired picture onto the plate with a\nhydrophobic, oily medium (think wax\ncrayons). Then hydrophilic gum Arabic in water is poured over so that it\nsurrounds the picture, forming the re-lief, turpentine is used to strip off the\nexcess oiliness from the original picture and the (oil-based) ink is poured\nover the top. Obviously, it sticks only\nto the original design and not the rest\nof the plate where the hydrophilic gum\nis. So then the inked-up plate can be\nused to produce multiple copies or ex-perimentation. I wish I\u2019d known this\nabout lithography as I was wandering about, mystified as to how exactly\nthese pictures had come to be, and why\nit mattered.\nThe pictures themselves are certainly varied, there\u2019s no chance of getting\nbored of the same style. Dali\u2019s start off\nwith a series of seriously cool posters\nhe made to advertise train destinations\nin France.\nThese large and gaudy pictures contrast with the next ones in the Dali section which are some surreal fine line\ndrawings of a tree-body cutting off\nits own leg and stuff like that. I can\u2019t\ndecide whether that sort of creepiness is really my type of thing but it\u2019s\nquite nice to see. There are also some\ntotally different sketchy scribbly pieces\nby Dali, like the owl which looks like a\nmassive biro doodle, and there\u2019s a little piece of card which boasts that Dali\nonce made a lithograph using snails\ndipped in oily stuff. This, disappoint-ingly, is not shown. And that\u2019s it! Move\nswiftly on to Warhol.\nWarhol really was a printmaker, and\nwhile Dali may be more well known for\nhis paintings, the Warhol wall is reassuringly lurid. There are some Marilyn\nMonroes and some pictures of him\namongst a couple of others. You\u2019ll have\nseen them before, but it\u2019s interesting to\nsee the full size faces layers of built-up\ndesign.\nAfter the first room, I preferred the\nsecond more. There\u2019s a gamut of Matisse\u2019s nudes, from the iconic minimal\nline drawings which are fantastically\nevocative, for all their simplicity, to\nplainly drawn studies, and a photo of\nMatisse drawing a nude model which I\nparticularly liked. There are even fun-ny, curvy women called \u201cMonumental\nodalisques\u201d on the little bit of card,\nalthough I didn\u2019t find that description terribly enlightening. It turns out\nan odalisque is a particularly Matisse\nthing and means an Ottoman slave\nwoman (part of the Imperial Harem,\nhaha).\nPicasso\u2019s section has a naked woman\npicking a flea off her bum (\u201camusing\nyet sensual\u201d?) and some really lovely\nink-flooded portraits which I thought\nwas printmaking at its finest; black and\nwhite and simply beautiful. Not being\na buff of any of the four great artists,\nI really enjoyed it, a nice espresso cup\nof great art.\nModern Masters- Dali, Picasso, Warhol and Matisse\nRoxanne Middleton nips down the road to the V&A to lift the lid on some misunderstood modern classics\nPicasso always regretted installing a window where his door was\n\n"

    "content": "5\nfelix FRIDAY 28 MAY 2010\nNEWS\nnews.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nof Commercial Services at Imperial stated that this\nreview was \u201cnot cuts-led\u201d. Commercial Services are\na branch of College\u2019s business that are ultimately\nresponsible for building and running of student\nhalls. They share the cost of the wardens with College\u2019s welfare services, but do not have any say in\nhow many wardens the College decides freshers\nneed.\nJackman insisted that although it was too late for\nthe Review\u2019s results to have effect on wardens in\nthe next academic year, no cuts would necessarily\nbe made.\n\u201cThe point of this Review is to accurately ascertain the value of the wardening system,\u201d he said.\nBoth Wright and Jackman were open to the idea\nthat if wardens were found to justify their current\ncosts, no cuts would be made. Despite this, there\nwas obvious inclination towards cutting rather\nthan unlikely further investment.\nWith the student Union seemingly accepting\nCollege\u2019s cuts to wardening, the onus of justification rests on the wardens themselves. Dr. Read has\nbeen a warden for three years, and although he\nunderstands the importance the College needs to\nput on disability and counselling services, he also\nreckons that the early role wardens play is an essential part of an Imperial student\u2019s experience at\nuniversity.\n\u201cCentral counselling and disability services are\nan essential part of the College\u2019s welfare system,\nand the wardening system provides complementary front-line welfare and pastoral care to first\nyear students who are particularly vulnerable to\nthe stresses of a new life away from home and in a\nchallenging academic and social environment.\u201d He\ncontinues, \u201cThe experience of first year students\nhas a significant impact on the ethos of the College\nand their enjoyment of life throughout their time as\nstudents at Imperial.\u201d\nNext year\u2019s Deputy President (Welfare), Vicki\nMasding, has also had plenty of first-hand experience with wardens at different levels of authority.\nAfter being a fresher in Beit Hall two years ago, she\nis currently a hall senior this year. Although she is\nnot directly involved in the review process, she has\nstated her opposition to any warden down-sizing.\nHer opposition puts her in a head-on collision with\nincumbent Deputy President (Welfare) James. She\nstated her appreciation of the vital role wardens\nplay for the majority of students at Imperial.\n\u201cThey take down barriers between the College\nand the students. This is especially important\nin your first year. We\u2019ve got to appreciate that a\nnumber of students rely on the cushion and support the wardens give, even if they do not actively\nuse them,\u201d she argued. \u201cSocially, they become your\nfriends around the clock. Counsellors are only\navailable on appointment and within office hours.\nUnlike a professional College counsellor, you never\nfeel like a warden is helping you as part of a job. It\u2019s\nadvice you\u2019d take from an older sibling or an Uncle\nwho\u2019s already experienced everything you\u2019re going\nthrough.\u201d\nSelkirk subwarden, Marcus Shepheard, also\npointed out that wardens are greatly advantageous\nfor first years going through a crucial transition between dependent and independent living.\n\u201cWardens are qualified for their positions by virtue of temperament and experience. The majority\nof issues we face are ones that all students face over\ntheir time at university and the added value comes\nfrom our first-hand experiences of how to resolve\nthese situations,\u201d he said. \u201cBy living within the hall\nand by being integrated into the freshmen community we are able to actively observe and catch\nwelfare issues while in their infancy.\u201d\nA subwarden for three years, he warned that war-dening duties inevitably impede on his academic\nwork, and that with a larger workload in a smaller\nteam would be severely detrimental.\n\u201cBeing a subwarden does involve a degree of sac-rifice. You will never improve your PhD by being a\nsubwarden. The time commitment is already at the\nlimit of what is reasonable in a team with four war-dens. In particular around the end of September\nand the start of October we lose a huge amount of\ntime ensuring that people integrate smoothly and\nhappily into university life,\u201d he admitted.\nProf. Wright also suggested that he was happy to\nsee larger modifications to the wardening system\nin his new role as Dean of Students. Currently,\nwardens receive free accommodation in return for\ntheir pastoral duties. This is considered the cost of\nthe wardens to College, and Prof. Wright loosely\nmentioned other forms of payment possible, such\nas warden stipends or honorariums.\nfelix has received mixed messages regarding the\nimminent Wardening System Review. Whilst some\nare adamant that this Review is not cuts-led but\nfor the benefit of pastoral services, others, most\nworringly including current Union representa-tives, have shown clear inclination and resignation\nto what they believe will be cuts to the wardening\nsystem. One feels there should be more pressure on\nCollege to carefully consider all factors and angle of\nthe down-sizing of wardening teams.\nW\nardens have highlighted that the\nWardening System Review comes\non the heels of what they describe as\n\u201chasty proposals\u201d to make cuts to the\nhall senior system.\nAn initial plan was made to downsize hall senior\nteams, but after some fierce rejection from warden\nrepresentatives, Dan Read said that College compromised by abolishing the subsidy hall seniors get on\nrental fees in return for their work during the year.\n\u201cThe College back-tracked on this proposal and instead cut the Hall Senior subsidy, resulting in an extra\ncost to Hall Seniors of about \u00a340k,\u201d he said.\nDespite advertising hall senior roles for next year\nfor the first time in years without the discount, usually\naround 10%, College have insisted that they have still\nrecruited a full complement of older undergraduates\nto fulfil the roles.\nThis is especially surprising especially as Head of\nCommerical Services, Paddy Jackman, confirmed\nthat rent prices will go up once again for Imperial\u2019s\nhalls of residences.\n\u201cThe 2.86% increase on rent for halls is lowest in\nthe sector,\u201d he said. In comparison, some of UCL\u2019s\nrent prices is set to increase by up to 9% next year. A\nensuite standard single room in Southwell Hall will\ncost around \u00a3158, and the most expensive room in\nthe new Eastside Halls will cost around \u00a3234 for the\nyear 2010-11.\nThis follows a 3.9% average increase on hall rent\nfrom last year. Rent has steadily been increasing over\nrecent years, with Southside single ensuite rooms\ncosting \u00a3155 in its first year of opening.\n\u201cWe realise we\u2019re at the top end of rent but the\nCollege is committed to making it affordable for students.\u201d With impending increases in tuition fees, this\nmay not be the case very soon.\nOf course, the wardens and amenity budgets are\nfactored into the cost of renting a room. Jackman\nnoted that pastoral and community care in student\naccommodation at Imperial is largely unrivalled. The\namenity budget for halls comes out of students\u2019 rent,\nand allows for social events to be put on to create a\nsense of belonging.\nHall Senior discounts abolished from next year as rent prices rise once again\nWelfare\u2019s more than just wardening\nI\nf the Wardening System Review is not\ncuts-led, the other argument for it is to\nfairly provide other branches of the College welfare system with deserved resources that wardening may be taking up.\nIt is an issue that the Union have pressured\nCollege into doing something about it.\nDespite hailing the job the current staff in\nthese welfare services do as \u201cincredible\u201d, he admitted Imperial is falling short on a national\nscale.\n\u201cWhilst the counsellors are doing excellent\nwork, assessments show they weren\u2019t at the\nlevel other universities are currently providing\nto their students,\u201d he said. \u201cThe recommended\nlevel of counselling provision is at least one full-time professional to every 3,000 students. We\u2019re\nnot quite there yet.\u201d\nThere are currently five part-time and one\nfull-time counsellors on campus for the 13,400\nstudents at Imperial and Prof. Wright suggested some \u201cmodest increases\u201d could be made for\n\u201cfurther admin support\u201d. He also noted that the\nnumber of students attending professional help\nsessions had steadily increased over the last few\nyears. Where previously a student would be\nguaranteed an appointment with a counsellor\nwithin the week of request, this is no longer the\ncase.\nProf. Wright also noted that investment was\nalso needed in the disability advisory service.\n6% of the student population are now claiming\ndisability help on campus, compared to 3% two\nyears ago. An increased awareness of services\navailable to students with physical and learn-Dean of Students\nProfessor Denis Wright\nemphasised the need to\nput more investment in the\ncounselling and disability\nadvisory services. He says\nthat Imperial\u2019s welfare\nprovisions in these areas\nare currently lower than\nmost other universities\ning disabilities has been so successful that the\nlimited structure of service currently in place is\nbeginning to feel the strains.\nWhere the money for these \u201cmodest increases\u201d in investment comes from is the issue at\nhand. The question is whether there should be\nless for wardening and more for counselling.\nWhere previously\na student would\nbe guaranteed an\nappointment with a\ncounsellor within the\nweek of request, this is\nno longer the case.\nPastoral care at other unis\nOxford and Cambridge have a very different model\nof pastoral care provided to their students. They have\na developed College Tutor system, as well as Head of\nHouse and Porter-style security. They have the fourth\nand fifth lowest first year drop-out rates respectively\nin the UK.\nLSE have a similar structure to that at Imperial\u2019s halls.\nBoth have hall-assigned teams of academic wardens.\nHowever, LSE\u2019s student : warden ratio is around 75 : 1,\nwhilst Imperial\u2019s is around 30 : 1.\nDespite the shortfall in wardens, LSE have the 24th\nlowest first year drop-out rates in the UK, whilst\nImperial only has the 27th. This could suggest LSE\nhave more effective professional or tutoring welfare\nsupport. - Victoria Brzezinski\nCollege are wary the\ncost of wardening teams\nis disproportionate to\nnumber of students it\nreaches.\n\n"

Fearing the worst\nafter losing the toss, IC were shocked\nto hear that KCL 2s wanted to field in\nthe 26 degree heat. Looking forward to\na long patch of sun-bathing, Pete sent\nsuperstar Anirudh and Joe O\u2019Gorman\nto open.\nThis proved to be an inspired deci-sion, leading to a season (and probably\nmuch longer) record opening stand of\n136 off just 16 overs. Anirudh\u2019s chance-less, classy 75 showed the immense\npotential that he has when he concen-trates. Only his ability to hit a reverse\nsweep so well as to pick out the only\nfielder on the boundary stopped him\nfrom going on to get a huge score: as\nhe quite elegantly stated back on the\nboundary \u201cif there wasn\u2019t a fielder there\nthat was 6\u201d\n. Joe continued to bat well\nuntil fatigue got on top of him and after being dropped twice in one over he\nholed out for an excellent 80. Adam,\ncoming back from being dropped after\nhis shocking 21 byes the game before,\nhit a quickfire 24; Bernard contributed\na solid 29 to propel IC to what was looking like a huge total. Unfortunately, the\nlower order couldn\u2019t quite make the\nmost of the opportunity and despite\nseveral elegant shots (including a beautifully timed lofted drive from Pete, who\npromptly missed the next quicker ball\nwith an attempt at the infamous Imperial College Late Cut; for some reason,\nhis team mates thought that he was ignoring their calls that a faster ball was\ncoming), the scoring rate slowed. Imperial finished on a decent 259 all out,\nbut a lot more had been expected by the\ncaptain after such a brilliant opening.\nAfter a decent tea, the team reluctantly took to the field in the sweltering heat and an opening combination\nof Daanish and Sridhar plugged away\nand were rewarded; Daanish was swept\nstraight into the hands of an expertly\nplaced Vinno at shortish midwicket.\nSridhar got the other opener lbw, which\nbrought the expected 1st team ringer to\nthe crease. He smashed some incredible\nstraight drives before playing all around\nTaking on London town\nImperial Men\u2019s Cricket 1st XI are victorious over neighbours King\u2019s College 2nds and UCL Medics this week\nImperial College Men\u2019s 1st XI\n\u2013 259 all out\nKings College London 2nd XI\n\u2013 158 all out\nImperial won by 101 runs\nAlex Tinsdale Cricket\nImperial College Union 1st XI\n\u2013 248\nRUMS (UCL Medics) 2nd XI\n\u2013 168 all out\nImperial won by 84 runs\nan extremely slow ball from Anrirudh.\nPete chipped in with a wicket, courtesy\nof a fortuitous lbw decision. A quick\nchange then brought on the second\nslow bowler, Joe, and the spin twins ran\nthrough the middle order, with Joe taking 2 wickets in two balls (the hat-trick\nball was dispatched for a one bounce\nfour much to the amusement of every-one). To their credit, the last KCL batsmen hung around, fortunate in one case\nwhere Adam showed why he was \u201cforgotten\u201d (or more bluntly dropped) with\na missed stumping. They managed to\nhit some big shots before the re-intro-duction of Daanish lead to the number\n10 being caught out. The result though\nwas never in doubt as Imperial pulled\noff a huge 101 run.\nAfter the game, wanting to instil some\nproper cricketing traditions into the\nteam, Pete lead the players to the pub\nfor a few social drinks and discussion\nabout the game. On the way back, man-of-the-match Joe showed that even\ncharity shopping was too expensive for\nhim as he picked up a very manly cardigan from the train. Adam, not wanting\nto make the journey boring either, spent\nhis time chatting up drunken married\nwomen at Wimbledon station and relieving his very weak bladder at several\nstops on the tube line with his team\nmates showing true team spirit by holding the doors open. Classy to the end.\nO\nn Wednesday, Imperial\nbatted first and were\ngiven a rapid start by\nour own IPL import Anirudh, who set off like a\nDelhi Daredevil and Deccan charged\nhis way to 26 from 22 balls, including a\nmonstrous six over long on. However,\nsearching for one DLF maximum too\nmany, he made a Rajasthan Royal mess\nof another booming drive and was\ncaught in the outfield.\nHowever, this setback only brought\nCaptain Ankit Patel to the crease.\nCalling upon his subcontinental an-cestory, he and Matt Tarr mastered\nthe conditions and batted their way\nto a comfortable 100-run partnership.\nHowever, with Ankit a fan of the quick\nsingle and Matt considerably less so,\na run-out seemed to be the inevitable\nend-point of the partnership. It was:\nperhaps wanting to put the captain-in-waiting in his place, Ankit ran out Matt\nTarr for a very well-played 49.\nIn fact, the run-out seemed to be the\ndominant theme for the rest of the Innings. Iain \u201cplease-put-in-the-reportthat-I-was-the-only-one-to-time-theball-off-the-front-foot-all-day\u201d Stobbs\nsmashed a very quick 36, even occasionally timing the ball off the front\nfoot, before a dodgy call from Ankit\nsent him on his way. However, oblivious to the cascade of falling wickets\nat the other end, Ankit batted on until\nthe penultimate ball for an excellent\n92, but not before he\u2019d had time to\ngive Adam Hugill the show-and-go en\nroute to run-out number three.\nA target of 249 in 40 overs was always going to be tough as the pitch\nwas, by the half-way point, starting to\nresemble the surface of the moon, and\nso it proved. Once Hasit and Anirudh\nhad removed their openers, the rest of\nthe team offered little resistance. Hasit\npicked up 4 wickets and Sridhar 3 (for\nzero runs), with Ahsaan Ismail ripping\nout both the middle and leg stumps\nwith one delivery despite the keeper\nstanding up to the stumps. It was\nfortunate that, on this occasion, the\nball hit the stumps after the batsman\nmissed it; on an astounding 21 other\noccasions the ball missed bat, stumps\nand keeper, contributing 21 byes to extras and a huge fine for Adam Hugill at\nthe end of the season...\n\n"

In a\nmarket full of expensive consumer electronics that are locked down\nand bound to carriers and application\nstores, the concept of releasing the\ncode to software that has taken you\nhundreds of hours to create may seem\nunintuitive, even silly. Yet despite the\nunorthodox business model that it en-genders, open source software is surprisingly successful. A Linux server is\nprobably behind a majority of websites\nyou browse daily, whilst open-source\nAndroid powered smartphones have\nrecently begun outselling the iPhone\nin the US. Yet despite a few notable\nexceptions, the concepts behind open\nsource are opaque to the average con-sumer, which is in my opinion, to the\ndetriment of the entire movement.\nOne reason for this situation could\nbe the fact that the concepts and ideology that define free/open source\nsoftware have been made ridiculously\ncomplicated by those creating the soft-ware. It\u2019s hard to get an ideological\nmovement going if no-one within the\nmovement can agree what the ideology truly is. An interesting example\nof this situation is the case of Linus\nTorvalds and Richard Stallman, two\nvery important people in the world of\nopen source. Between them, they have\nhelped in the creation of some of the\nmost widely used software tools in\nthe world. Yet their philosophies on\nthe way code should be released differ\ngreatly. Stallman is the leading figure\nin the Free Software Movement, an organisation that works towards software\nthat can be freely distributed, modified\nand used without restrictions. The\nFree Software Movement could fairly\naccurately be described as the radical\nfar-left of the software industry. Stallman, in a testament to this culture,\nwill only use a single Chinese netbook\nthat solely runs free and open source\nsoftware and nothing else. In contrast,\nthe general open source movement\n(that the Free Software Movement attempts to distance itself from) isn\u2019t as\nconcerned with the licensing issues as\nthey are with spreading the concept of\nopen source, even if that means having\nto work with closed-source companies in a trade-off. Those behind the\nLinux kernel recently accepted a code\ncontribution from Microsoft, with Linus Torvalds (the father of Linux) say-ing: \u201cI really find the whole notion of\nLinux as being \u201cagainst Microsoft\u201d to\nbe silly and wrong-headed\u201d. With there\nbeing no agreement within the move-ment, it\u2019s hard to attract investment\nfrom businesses, who worry that the\nfrequent and drastic licensing changes\nthat have typified the last few years of\nopen source software design, might\nwork against them in the long term.\nOne of the greatest things about\nopen source software is choice. There\u2019s\na huge amount of software out there,\nand some of it is great. Yet the community behind open source software\ncan sometimes be intimidating to\nsay the least. From Stallman with his\nfrankly ridiculous Free Software Song\nto the endless bickering about software choices on internet forums, getting advice on software that is impartial and unclouded by dogma is hard.\nAdvertising campaigns seem only to\nattack other closed source software\nwithout really educating people about\nbenefits of open source. The end effect\nis a confusing jumble of contradictory\nideas all being shouted at loud volumes\n- an effect that is frankly annoying and\noff-putting.\nYet despite these problems, open\nsource software has grown remarkably over the last decade. Linux has\nbeen at the forefront of this growth,\nwith its dominance of the server mar-ket, running the majority of the world\u2019s\nsupercomputers, and even the surprising rise of Google\u2019s Android mobile\noperating system. In some ways, the\napproach taken by Linux has been the\nmost pragmatic, accepting help from\nthose who offer it regardless of differing ideologies and with a surprising\nresistance to dogma. Its success shows\nthat open source can succeed. Yet as\nlong as the continual disputes over ideology and licensing continue, it\u2019s probable that businesses won\u2019t see open\nsource as a serious and viable option\nto replace their current software pack-ages. In the end, consumers will simply\nchoose big named closed-source alternatives that don\u2019t come with the baggage of ideologies that they feel they\nhave no personal investment in or simply don\u2019t understand.\nI\nf you haven\u2019t heard, Google\nlaunched its attempt to infiltrate\nthe TV space with Internet con-tent. Google TV aims to bring not\nonly video but the whole Internet onto\nthe small screen. But it\u2019s not the first to\nattempt to do so. Microsoft tried and\nfailed to do the same thing many years\nago with its WebTV. Google thinks\nthe failures of the past have been due\nto poor implementation, but I beg to\ndiffer.\nOK, having certain web content on\nyour TV would be a boon. Web video\nsuch as YouTube, Hulu and the plethora of other user created and network\nproduced online video sites often deserve to get off your monitor and actually onto your primary watching de-vice, your TV. But anyone who\u2019s ever\ntried to surf the web on their TV will\nknow that it\u2019s a paradigm that simply\ndoesn\u2019t work.\nThe thing is your TV viewing experience is a long distance one. You\nsit several metres from your TV and\ncontrol it with a simple remote. Reading subtitles, and possibly the digital\ntext that replaced TeleText, is about as\nmuch reading as you\u2019re ever likely to\ndo on your TV and there\u2019s a reason for\nthat. Reading text on your TV is both a\nstrain on your eyes and plainly annoying if the text is too small.\nTo do justice to web browsing on\nyour TV you\u2019re going to have to sit\npretty close to that screen of yours,\neven if it is a monster. And that\u2019s the\nproblem; you are going to have to get\noff your comfy sofa and either grab a\nchair or sit on the floor in the middle\nof your living room. If your TV was\nthe only place to consume the web,\nperhaps this would be a viable option,\nbut it\u2019s not. I for one am not going to\nbother getting off my arse just to view a\nbit of news or IMDB on my TV when I\nWeekly Wrap-up: A quick guide to the best of the rest you might have missed\nR\noll up, roll up, what\nhave we got for you\nthis week eh? Well in\nthe wake of the Google geekfest that was Google IO,\nthe big G\u2019s web video format\ncame under a bit of fire.\nWebM, heralded by Google\nas the open source answer to\nthe video war currently raging in the HTML5 spec,\nhas spiked the interest of\nthe MPEG-LA, the folks\nwho licence out the\nH.264 specification.\nAccording to them,\nthe WebM with VP8\nvideo codec flies\njust a little too close\nto the premium H.264\ncodec and therefore might\nnot be as free as everyone\nthinks. Maybe Steve Jobs was\nright when he said patent litigation was not far away for the\nopen source audio and video\ncodecs.\nThe little green Android has\nalso been in the news this week\nwith Froyo causing quite a stir.\nGoogle claims Android 2.2\nhas the fastest mobile\nbrowser and it\u2019s quite\npossible with Froyo\nshowing a 4.5x\nspeed increase\nin several benchmarks over Eclair.\nThen we\u2019ve\ngot the news that\n\u2018Gingerbread\u2019 will\nbe the next tasty edition\nof Android, packing WebM\nsupport among other things\nand will land around Q4 2010.\nMore mobile news this week\nfrom Samsung with Europe\u2019s\nfirst Bada phone, the Wave.\nOK, the phone is pretty sweet,\nbut Bada, well, let\u2019s just say it\u2019s\na bit disappointing. Slap Android on it for goodness sake!\nLG showed off some serious\n3D screen real-estate this week\nwith their 84-inch 3DTV, packing a whopping 3840x2160 res-olution. That\u2019s UHD, or Ultra\nHD; shame about the highly\n\u2018fashionable\u2019 glasses you need.\nSony was in on the OLED\naction this week with its prototype rollable OLED display.\nThe 4.1 inch display is 80\u00b5m\nthin and can wrap around\nanything thicker than 8mm in\ndiameter, like a pen or pen-cil. Outputting 16M colours\nwith a 1000:1 contrast ratio\nand 100nits brightness, the\n432x240 resolution display\ncould be the future of wear-able, rollable, slide out displays\njust like every decent sci-fi\nmovie. Let\u2019s just hope it makes\nit to market in the near future.\nSocial networking is a luxury\nthat the majority of us enjoy\nin one form or another, but\nit\u2019s undoubtedly a great way\nto get into trouble if you\u2019re in\nthe public spotlight. To save\nhis players from that prob-lem, England manager Fabio\nCapello has banned his squad\nfrom partaking in Twitter and\nFacebook. To be fair out of the\npreliminary named squad only\nDarrent Bent, the Sunderland\nstriker, actually used Twitter.\nSo if you were hoping for in-the-dressing-room progress\nreports from Rooney, Lampard\nand Rio, I\u2019m afraid you\u2019re out\nof luck.\nNokia and Yahoo announced\na partnership this week to\ntrade services. Nokia is going\nto run Yahoo\u2019s online mapping,\nto take on market leader Google Maps, whilst Yahoo is going\nto bring its webmail expertise\nto Nokia phones. More competition is always good, but can\nNokihoo! really compete?\nLast but not least, Apple\nlaunched the iPad in the UK\ntoday. Available in store with\nseriously short supply, good\nluck actually getting one.\nAll Google\nTV\u2019d out\nSamuelGibbs\nSamuelGibbs Technology Editor\ncan just grab my iPhone, my laptop, my\nnetbook or perhaps my tablet and do\nit. It\u2019ll be a damn sight better browsing\nexperience on all those devices than it\npossibly could be on my TV.\nIf we look at the devices that can\ncurrently access the Internet that pack\na browser and are plugged into your\nTV, we\u2019ve got things like the PS3, the\nWii, Media Centre PCs, perhaps even\na Boxee box or Mac Mini. All of these\ndevices do an admirable job of rendering text on the big screen, but you have\nto zoom in so far to actually read it that\nit disrupts the browsing experience\nwell beyond being a decent one.\nIs the answer reformatting and re-flow of text to fit the screen? Perhaps\nyou could strip out the content from\nthe site and display it in a purpose\nmade \u2018TV mode\u2019. But again, isn\u2019t it just\neasier to grab that netbook that\u2019s beside you?\nThe other problem with browsing on\nyour TV is that for the most part, TV\nwatching isn\u2019t a solitary experience.\nAre your friends, family or strangers\nwatching in from the street, really going to be chuffed with you taking up all\nor a significant portion of the screen\nto look up who directed the Exorcist?\nPerhaps the only social aspect of the\ncurrent web experience is web video,\nmeaning the browser simply gets you\nto the video content, nothing more.\nGoogle initially wants you to use\nanother box under your TV that essentially sits in between your content\nboxes like Sky, Virgin, FreeviewHD or\nFreeSatHD receivers and your TV. It\u2019s\nanother box to buy that doesn\u2019t really\ndo anything you can\u2019t already do with\nother devices. Perhaps once Google\nmanages to get Google TV into actual\nTVs with partners like Sony, maybe\nyou\u2019ll find it gaining traction. But that\u2019s\nstill only a maybe for the big G.\nst of\nlks\n4\nmight\nbrow\npos\n\u2018\nbe th\n\n"

I can report, with an irrepressible grin, that it was both a\nvisual and sonic treat for the senses:\nthe musical equivalent of tiramisu,\nsurely the ultimate in desserts.\n\u2018I probably have a bit of a different\nsound because I don\u2019t really know\nwhat I\u2019m doing,\u2019 she once said. Well,\nwho does? The best things in life often emerge from those who are just\nwinging it. The difference between\nher and most indie-pop-new-wave-upside-down-topsy-turvey acts out\nthere these days is that she is both\nconfident and impatient, both pow-erful-yet-rare virtues in the hedonistic 21st Century.\nCase in point: the first album, for\nmany bands, has a few songs on\nit that are specifically designed to\nlaunch themselves into the public\nconsciousness, whether through ac-cessible, catchy lyrics, or something\nthat is so infuriatingly annoying, intellectually insulting, yet impossibly\npersistent. Marina\u2019s debut album\ncontains lyrics involving metaphorical vomiting, musings over tooth-paste, and lots of monkey noises. Oh,\nand at one point, she is, we assume,\npursued by come rather naughty cut-lery. You must be both impatient and\nconfident to fire yourself into the\npublic soundscape with material like\nthat; better yet, you must be incredibly talented to make it sound so utterly brilliant.\nLyrically, she weaves contemporary poetry, pointing out those who\ndisappoint and those who could be\nso much more: \u201cYou\u2019ve been hanging\nwith the unloved kids/who you never\nreally liked and you never trusted/\nbut you are so magnetic/you pick up\nall the pins.\u201d Her songs are colour-ful, mystical, and pleasingly ironic\ntakes on people and their highlights,\nmisgivings, and misjudgements, including her own; she picks apart\nmentalities and infuses them with\nher own individualistic flair. Each\ntrack performed not only has its own\npersonality, but its own unique vocal\nidentity. The rapid pitch-changes on\n\u201cHollywood\u201d; the ethereal highs of \u201cI\nAm Not A Robot\u201d; the melancholy\n\u201cObsessions\u201d; the near-insane Jungle\nBook-infused \u201cMowgli\u2019s Road\u201d: all\nMost listened to this week by\nFelix Music members on last.fm\n1.

    "content": "4 felix FRIDAY 28 MAY 2010\nnews.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nNEWS\nT\nhe vast majority of students at Imperial have had an experience involving\na hall warden. Even the most evasive\nof freshers would have at least been\ngreeted by one as they moved into\ntheir halls of residences on their first day.\nCollege are due to comprehensively review the\nwardening systems in halls, which is likely to result\nin a downsizing of the pastoral care teams within\nfirst year accommodation.\nA small real-term decrease has been made on\nCollege\u2019s Welfare Budget for next year, and hall seniors have suffered the immediate brunt of the cuts.\nFrom as early as next October, the traditional 10%\nsubsidy on rent that they are provided with in return\nfor their help to the wardening team during the year\nhas been abolished.\nProfessor Denis Wright, the new Dean of Students, was appointed at the beginning of this academic year. He faces his first major decision as he\nlooks to rebalance College\u2019s budget for welfare services with slightly less money.\nTalking to felix, Prof. Wright said that they needed\nto be \u201cmore careful about using money in the future\u201d on the services which include the College Tutor system, disability advisory service and College\ncounsellors, in addition to the cost of hall wardens.\nHowever, some claim it is not the lack of money\nthat has initiated this review. College are wary the\ncost of wardening teams is disproportionate to\nnumber of students it reaches. Wardens are only\nimmediately available to the around 2,000 first year\nstudents that choose to live in College-organised\naccommodation, but takes up 50% of the total welfare budget. Arguments have been put forward that\nmore money should be invested in disability advisors and full-time counselling services as they are\naccessible to every student at Imperial, and not just\nfreshers.\nHowever, wardens themselves have voiced their\nopposition to any impending cuts to their teams.\nDan Read, Warden of Falmouth and Keogh Halls,\nsaid any cuts made to the 86-strong wardening roster would be \u201ca shame\u201d.\n\u201cIt is interesting that the College is conducting a\nreview so soon after the external review of Residences in 2005 which recognised the invaluable role of\nthe wardening system in fostering an environment\nthat enables students to adjust to academic and social pressures of moving to Imperial. It would be a\nshame if College were to retract its commitment to\nHalls welfare, which is consistently rated highly in\nstudent satisfaction surveys,\u201d he said to felix.\nThe Wardening System Review is in its preliminary stages. The level of wardening for postgraduate\nstudents in College accommodation is to remain the\nsame at around 65 students to every warden. This\nwill be factored into the construction of new postgraduate accommodation at Clapham Junction and\non the newly acquired Wood Lane site. A meeting\nnext Tuesday will determine the wardening ratio for\nundergraduates. This currently varies widely, from\n21 students per warden in Parsons House to 39 in\nBeit Hall.\nFive working groups have been established to fully\nassess how the wardening system at Imperial can be\nchanged for the better. One of the working groups\nfocuses on pastoral care, in which student\u2019s representative John James is part of. As Deputy President\n(Welfare) of the Union, he is all but resigned to cuts\nmade to the wardening roster in halls.\n\u201cThe current recommendation [from the Union]\nis that an Imperial hall of residence must not rise\nabove more than 30 students per warden,\u201d he stated.\nCurrently, eight of sixteen Imperial halls have a ratio lower than 30 students to one warden, including\nSelkirk, Tizard, and Gabor; three halls in the lucra-tive, near-campus Prince\u2019s Gardens location.\nJames describes his role on the Review panel as\nminimising any slashes to wardens made by College.\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t help to fight any cut,\u201d he stated. James\npersonally testified that Imperial had the \u201cbest war-dening system in the UK if you consider the support\nfirst year students actually get.\u201d\nDespite his proclamations of the wardening sys-tem, he suggested that the cuts being made were a\ntypical example of any organisation under financial\npressure.\n\u201cWhen cuts have to be made, it is natural to trim\nthe services that are doing well. I disagree with the\nidea that these cuts mean what the wardens provide\nto students are not valued at their current cost,\u201d he\nsaid.\nOn the contrary however, Paddy Jackman, Head\nWARDENS: A\nHELPING OR\nHINDERING\nHAND?\nWardens in halls look to be cut, Hall Senior subsidies\nare no more, and rent figures rise yet again. All would\nsuggest doom and gloom for those living in College\naccommodation. Is it barbaric cash-making, necessary\nsavings, or in the best interests of students? Which ever\nway, it\u2019s all a bit complicated. Dan Wan tries to explain...\nF\nelixsurveyedstudents\nliving in a variety of\nhalls, and asked them\nwhat they reckoned\nthe role of their wardening\nteam was. Most were inclined\nto use their wardens for advice on problems they\u2019ve never experienced at university\nbefore. The second most common answer showed that students mainly saw the wardens\nas the face of hall-organised\nevents. People were generally quite vague when actually\nquestioned about their wardens and few cited personal\nexamples of what wardens\nwere there to do.\n62% of students revealed\nthey rarely ever spoke to their\nwardens, and 68% said they\nwould feel comfortable within halls without wardens and\nsubwardens.\nTake what you wish from\nthese statistics. They reportedly oppose overwhelmingly\npositive feedback from previous student-led surveys\nregarding first year pastoral\ncare.\nIs it a case of unappreciative\nstudents not realising the wardens\u2019 work behind the scenes\nof their hall, or are live-in wardens a dated and underused\npastoral care system?\nAre wardens valued?\n68%\nof students claim\nthat they would\nbe comfortable in\nhalls without sub-wardens, and just\nenhanced security\nOctober 2009: Wilkinson Hall wardens and Seniors help freshers move in\n\n"

Eyeliner and mascara can prove to be the difference between being a Plain Jane to being a sexy\nfashionista, giving shape and definition to highlight your eyes. They really\nare the fundamentals of eye make-up,\nbut there is still a lot of scope to play\naround with colours, application techniques and different types of make-up\nAvailable in over ten different colours,\nthis liquid liner will allow you to\nexperiment with new exciting looks.\nLong-lasting and water resistant, this\ngel form of eyeliner offers the precision\nof a liquid liner but is easier to apply\nthan most liquids.\nThis cake eye-liner is perfect. It lasts\nforever and with a choice of black or\nbrown, it\u2019s compact and suitable for day\nand evening-wear. Don\u2019t forget, you\nneed to find a good brush to accompany\nthis cake eyeliner, which Benefit will\nalso provide for a meagre \u00a312.50. Their\n\u2018Get Bent\u2019 liner brush makes for easy\napplication, especially when doing the\ntop eyelids.\nURBAN DECAY\nLIQUID LINER\n\u00a311.00\nBOBBI BROWN\nLONG WEAR\nGEL EYELINER\n\u00a315.00\nBENEFIT\nBABE CAKE\n\u00a315.50\navailable.\nWhen it comes to eyeliner, there are\na few different types to choose from;\nnot only liquid or pencil, we also have\ncakes and gels and other, more exotic\ntypes, such as felt-tips. Personally, I\nuse a combination of a kohl pencil and\na cake eyeliner. An important point to\nnote when using cake eyeliners is that\na quality brush to apply it with is essen-tial. Because the kohl pencil is easier to\napply, I use this on the bottom eyelid,\nand then apply the cake eyeliner to the\ntop. I find it best to have a variation\nbetween black and brown eyeliners so\nthat you can use brown during the day\nand black for a night out.\nYou don\u2019t have to limit yourself to\nblack and brown. For a night out, experiment with other colours. I find that\nCharlotte Morris\nCharlotte Morris\nwhite and silver work well, as do metallic blues and purples.\n\n"

There is\nnothing better than a good old singsong of dodgy nineties Britpop (or in\nmy case a fuckload of theatre songs).\nOr get some cheap watercolour paints\nand have a painting contest in the park.\nBest picture wins beer.\nI suffer from nasty bouts of hayfever\nand hate hot weather so I\u2019ll be taking\nmy culture indoors thank you very\nmuch. For me this means singing incredibly loudly whilst writing my dissertation (apologies to my flatmates!)\nand doodling a costume design or two.\nAlthough I\u2019ll never say no to a good old\ntrip to the theatre. We in the felix Arts\noffice have been raving about Hair.\nCaz saw the press night and I went on\nopening night. It was absolutely phenomenal from the show itself to racing around the entire theatre to get\nthe opportunity to dance onstage to\nrefusing to get off said stage. My friend\nand I met everyone from James Rado,\nwriter of Hair (he was pretty stoned\nand attempted to pat me on the head)\nto Jodie Prenger, soon to be starring as\nthe Lady of the Lake in Spamalot on\ntour.\nFor those of you still suffering with\nexamavitis, never fear! I\u2019ve found you\nsome culture without even leaving the\nlibrary. Don\u2019t be scared of the Haldane\nCollection it really does hold some\ntreasures. Rox Middleton hasn\u2019t gone\nmuch further, taking in a new exhibition at the V&A. Rosie Milton reports\nback from the Tate Modern and, in a\ntriumphant return, Why I Like is back\nwith a look at Judy Garland.\nTen Years of Tate, yay!\nRosie Milton looks at the Tate Modern\u2019s \u2018Festival of Independents\u2019\nToo Darn\nHot...\nLucyHarrold\nLucyHarrold Arts Editor\nI\nknow, I\u2019m supposed to keep an\nopen mind when it comes to\ncontemporary art, or \u2018happenings\u2019 (whatever the on-trend\nterm may be nowadays). However, although the plethora of activity\non view at the Tate this weekend was\nsupposed to instil a sense of excitement about current art production, it\nreally didn\u2019t. My peers\u2019 view of Tate\nis normally withering and anti-estab-lishment. I think they mostly disagree\nwith the curatorial processes in terms\nof the displays of the modern art and\nthe message of the big shows. For ex-ample, criticism of how the Rothko\u2019s\nare hung has often come up in class. I\nwould be lying if I said I agreed; I actually like the soft, muted greys of the\nRothko room (when occupied by said\nworks) and have no idea of their original placement in the Seagram building\nto compare with.\nI approached the mini-festival, \u2018No\nSoul For Sale \u2013 A Festival of Independents\u2019, with an open mind. As I have just\nalluded to, I subscribe to Tate\u2019s method\nof putting on events and \u2018blockbuster\nshows\u2019 and was intrigued by this particular event. Unfortunately this festival \u2013 apparently representative of the\n10 years that Tate Modern has existed \u2013 did not, I feel, do justice to that\nwhich it was celebrating.\nThe back of the main turbine hall\nwas the site for the festival; areas had\nbeen partitioned off and labelled, by\nway of taped margins on the floor. Coloured bits of paper, random objects\nand stalls of various kinds, not to mention crowds of people milling around\naimlessly, had swallowed up every\nsquare inch. At first we attempted to\ninvestigate every partition, working in\nan anti-clockwise movement. Nothing\nseemed to be clear \u2013 there was the usual unexplained conceptual display: a\nseated girl holding the carcass of a blue\nchicken, television screens on the floor\nplaying film, paper everywhere with\nnondescript text and an abundance\nof other bits and pieces. Strangely\nenough this festival calls to mind another event that spans only a couple of\ndays and needs to be as absent as it is\npresent in only matter of hours: that\nof the Chelsea Flower Show. Knowing active participants of the competition aspect, I understand that you are\ngiven a small concrete space and have\nto recreate a \u2018moment\u2019 almost, of a garden that should look as if it has always\nbeen there, then dismantle it at the end\nof the show. This of course raises the\nvery issue that I have with the \u2018Festival\nof Independents\u2019: there is the obvious\nfacet of financial backing. I appreciate\nthe fact that this event was free for all\nand sundry, but that very fact became\npainfully obvious by its general de-meanour and \u2018hippyishness\u2019. The small\nexhibits were tired and sad; like a really bad jumble sale. A car-boot-type\ntrestle table was set up in one area with\nready-made knick-knacks that had all\nbeen modified in some debilitating\nway, making them even more undesirable than they would have been before.\nOther irksome spectacles: a photocopier churning out pages and pages of the\nsame bland script on A3 (what is the\npoint?), a faux shaman playing music\nthrough house plants (yes, even I didn\u2019t\n\u2018get it\u2019) and very expensive boring art\nbooks everywhere (no surprise there).\nI enjoyed the energy of the event,\nbut I have to put my hands up and say\nthat when it comes down to it, I prefer\na little bit more the gloss of the estab-lishment. Tate were clearly just trying\nto show that they were \u2018down with the\nkids\u2019. After 10 years of displaying a collection which is equal to such a huge\namount of expenditure (not to mention what we have spent on tickets of\nthe big shows) it was frankly insulting\nto see this rickety fair as the epitome of\nthis last decade. Send the kids back to\nthe East End and let\u2019s hope Tate pulls\nits socks up.\n10 years of the Tate Modern was celebrated by the \u2018Festival of Independents\u2019\nAbove: The floorplan from Festival of\nIndependents.\nLeft: Art and music combine as these\nplants play dinky little tunes.\nTHE ARTS\n\n"

As her distraction ensued, the pram in which his grandmother was tending\nto rolled towards the tracks. The Victorian train company admitted that its older platforms slope towards the tracks. As is\nshown on CCTV footage, the grandmother strove to save the\npram from falling onto the tracks, but failed. The pram rolled\nonto the tracks and underneath the body of an oncoming train.\nLuckily, the child escaped with minor bruises and scratches.\nThis is the second such incident to happen in Melbourne in\nthe past year.\nAustralia\nF\nourty-four people were killed in Jamaica in the hunt\nfor a drug kingpin. Street battles have occured for\nover three days in West Kingston as police sought\nto arrest Christopher \u2018Dudus\u2019 Coke, a member of\nAmerica\u2019s \u201cMost Wanted\u201d list. Jamaican Prime Minister Bruce\nGolding has been under increasing pressure from the Obama\nadministration after it promised to crack down on the drug\ntrade. As the firefight raged on in Tivoli Gardens, a section\nof Kingston, Coke was rumoured to have escaped the security\nforces. Local residents complained of grenades being thrown\nerrantly as well as the burning of bodies in the streets. Coke\nis reported to be highly revered by residents in West Kingston\nfor the services his empire provides them; he is known locally\nas the \u201cpresident\u201d.\nI\nran faced the threat of new U.N. economic sanctions this\nweek. The U.S. announced that it had received the commitments of each veto holder on the U.N. Security Council for a draft resolution that would impose economic\nsanctions on Iran due to its nuclear programme. Iran early this\nmonth proposed to trade 1,200kg of its low-enriched uranium\nfor nuclear fuel, a deal which mirrored a proposal by the U.S.\nlast year. This proposal did not manage to dissuade the Security Council from agreeing to sanctions. Russia\u2019s commitment\nto the principle of sanctions took Iran off guard; it was commonly believed that Russia would delay judgement on the pro-posal. Russia\u2019s decision to support the draft was surprising due\nto the extensive diplomatic and economic dies between the two\ncountries. Iran\u2019s president said that Russia would be a \u201chistoric\nenemy\u201d of Iran if it followed out this decision.\nL\nabour\u2019s promised increase\nin University places to\n20,000 has been halved by\nthe new coalition government in a bid to cut back on\nspending. Although record numbers\nof students are applying, there will be\n10,000 fewer places this Autumn than\npromised by the previous government.\nThe Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, responsible for Universities, said the cut in numbers will\nsave \u00a3118 million. The cut, however,\nwill mainly affect Science, Technology,\nEngineering and Mathematics (STEM)\nsubjects, due to the previous government\u2019s planned increase focusing in this\narea.\nThe promise of increased students\nin the Sciences was popular with business leaders who frequented the idea\nthat more science graduates would\nhelp the British industry compete\ninternationally.\nThe government has said that spending on research, innovation, business\nand enterprise will be protected. The\ntotal budget for Higher Education\nstands at \u00a37.3 billion.\nThis move to reduce the Labour fund\nto provide extra places by \u00a3118 million\nhas been slammed by the Lecturers\u2019\nUnion, who said ministers had \u201cdashed\nthe hopes of thousands of people\u2019\u2019. Sally\nHunt, general secretary of the University and College Union, commented\non how \u201cour competitor countries are\nincreasing the number of graduates\nto compete in a high-skill knowledge\neconomy\u2019\u2019 yet \u201cwe are denying thousands a place at university and increasing the burden on our benefits system.\u2019\u2019\nBy reducing the increase in STEM\nplaces, students who fail to meet their\nconditional offers from Universities in\ntheir A level results will have fewer options when entering the Clearing sys-tem.

This means\nthat more than 200,000 could miss out.\u2019\u2019\nThe funding arrangements mentioned\nhere, however, only relate to England,\nwhile Universities UK represents Higher Education bodies across the UK.\n\u201cWhat is critical is the need for funding per student to be maintained. That\nis the only way we can hope to maintain the world-leading position of the\nUK\u2019s higher education system\u2019\u2019, Smith\nadded. \u00a3150 million saved from government wide spending cuts will be used to\nfund 50,000 new apprenticeship places,\nhowever. The move was praised by Lee\nHopley, chief economist at the EEF Engineering Employers\u2019 group, who said\n\u201cshifting skills funding in favour of ap-prenticeships, which provide higher\nlevel qualifications, could provide a big\nboost to companies already seeing skills\nshortages as orders pick up\u2019\u2019\n, but he added that, \u201cthe loss of University spots in\nSTEM subjects may be the sting in the\ntail.\u2019\u2019\nThe Russell Group warned that \u201ca\nsuccession of cuts could lead to universities and courses closing and much\nhigher student ratios, damaging top\nuniversities beyond repair.\u2019\u2019 Overall\nspending on Higher Education will,\nhowever, increase compared to last\nyear, but further savings of \u00a3600 million across Higher Education, Science\nand Research budgets are required over\n2011-2013.\nApproximately \u00a360 million of the cuts\nto be made are still yet to be identified.\nImperial College has commented on\nthis and said that \u201cthe number of new\nImperial undergraduate students starting in 2010 is expected to be much the\nsame as in 2009\u2019\u2019 and that there is likely\nto be no increase. They say \u201cit\u2019s worth\nbearing in mind that HEFCE has announced the overall budget for the\nsector but individual universities won\u2019t\nknow what their own allocation will be\nuntil March.\u2019\u2019\nFormer Higher Education Minister,\nDavid Lammy said that the fears were\n\u201cscaremongering\u2019\u2019\n, but Steve Smith,\npresident of Universities UK, said the\ncuts would impact on the quality of\nteaching and competition for University places would be increased.

    "content": "Alex Kendall and Nicolas Massie question :\n7\nfelix FRIDAY 28 MAY 2010\nF\nairness; a word used frequently during the general\nelection; so much so that\nmost people will end up\nwondering if they are being\ndealt with fairly, by the government,\ntheir employer or indeed, their uni-versity. There are many times during\nour degrees when we think we are being dealt with unfairly by our departments or Imperial as a whole. There\nare also plenty of examples of inter-university differences which can be\nseen as unfair; the argument that a 2.2\nfrom Imperial is as good as a 2.1 from\nmost other Universities is an example.\nOne of the greatest issues of fairness\nis the way our work is marked. There\nare not only differences in marking\nbetween Universities and depart-ments, but also between individu-als. Exams are marked anonymously,\nthe marker not knowing the name of\nthe student. This is an attempt to exclude bias or prejudice by the exam-iner, whilst ensuring that the quality\nof the work rather than the student\nis assessed. If we accept this principle to be valid, and something to be\nupheld, why then do we not use it for\nall assessed coursework? I believe this\nquestion must be answered. Blind\nmarking across Imperial for all pieces\nof coursework and all exams should\nbe our goal, a justified burden on re-sources, if it even is one.\nThe implementation of blind marking would contribute to several\nworthwhile university goals: standardised assessed work across College,\nimproved trust of students in a system\nwhich evaluates them for three or four\nyears, and a removal of any conscious\nexpectation or subconscious bias or\nprejudice by markers. It would still\nallow students to receive personal\nfeedback on work as once the mark\nhas been given, the CID number can\nbe converted back into a name and the\nwork made available.\nThere does not need to be any evidence of foul play by markers to ask\nfor such a system. I do not believe that\nthere is a lot of conscious bias and I\nprefer to trust our lecturers. But there\nis always the threat of unconscious\nbias leading to similar marks for all\npieces of a student\u2019s coursework regardless of the quality, simply because they have been labelled out of\nexpectation as of a particular grade.\nOr, worse, they could be directly discriminated against. A system of blind\nmarking would cancel out both the\nbias and the impression that there\ncould be bias.\nLeeds and Swansea Universities\napply this principle, and mark blind\nfor all assessed work which counts\ntowards the final grade. There are exceptions made, as there would have to\nbe in our case, for presentations and\nvivas.\nIt is not a new idea; University\nstandards is a national issue and\nanonymous marking used to be an\nNUS campaign, so I hope lecturers\nand other markers will not take of-fence. The whole point of an external\nexaminer, after all, is to make sure our\nmarking system is sound. If external\nexaminers are accepted as necessary\nfor exams and major pieces of coursework to ensure fair marking, then\nsurely the logical next step is for another check on all pieces of assessed\nwork, the blind system. In fact, since\nall assessed work should probably be\nmarked by two people, the double-blind system.\nAs long as there is the proviso that\nfeedback will not be compromised,\nanonymous marking will lead to students having greater faith in the sys-tem. With the expectation of changes\nin student fees arrangements to come\nwith the Browne review, we have to\ndemand more transparency and better value for money. This is one way.\nIt\u2019s only fair.\nT\nhere is a certain aspect\nof University life that is\nuniversally reviled by all.\nFor most, it lasts for a\nfew unpleasant weeks, after which it can, with great relief, be\npushed from one\u2019s mind. For some, it\nuncomfortably squeezed, as if by some\nmetaphysical crowbar, into a week,\nor less, of excruciating torment. For\na certain few with dangerously masochistic inclinations, it occupies them\nfor months at a time, consuming them\ncompletely and depositing their broken husks on the steps of the Union. I\nspeak, of course, of revision.\nEven from the other side of this letter,\nI can feel your collective shudder. It is\na cruel trick that no matter how much\none revises, there always appears to be\ninfinitely more to do. Unwise comparisons with one\u2019s peers only reinforce\nthe vast gulf of ignorance that must be\ncrossed to achieve that degree. Imagining one\u2019s colleagues on the far side\nof this chasm, regardless of their own\ntrue position, drives a wedge in even\nthe deepest of comradeships.\nIn efforts to bridge the unfathomable\ngap in personal knowledge during this\ngrossly unpleasant period, students\ndescend ever deeper into unhealthy\nneuroticism. Beverages shift from bottled water to re-caffeinated coke, coke\nturns to double espresso, coffee turns\nto snorting ProPlus off a librarian\u2019s\nback. Taking the stairs instead of the\nlift constitutes the whole of a week\u2019s\nexercise. Eating moves from half-healthy meals at semi-regular times\nto mysterious quests in the twilight of\n4am to find a shop still open, regardless of whether or not their stock is\nedible or not.\nAnd the only way out of this most\nuncomfortable of periods is by exami-nation, a horror in itself. As if the time\nspent falsely imprisoned by ignorance\nwasn\u2019t bad enough, our only means of\nescape is through a potentially weeks-long tunnel of mental diarrhoea. We\ndon\u2019t even have the benefit of Morgan\nFreeman narrating our ordeal. (The\nShawshank Redemption \u2013 great film,\ngreat metaphor). I\u2019ll refrain from talking about the exams any further as\nthat\u2019s another tin of worms ready and\nwaiting to shank me that I\u2019d rather not\nopen.\nBut revision, for most of us, does\nend eventually. It is simply a matter\nof finding a way to make it, certainly\nnot easy or interesting, but bearable.\nI don\u2019t know how you seek to accomplish this but I have stumbled over a\nrather novel solution.\nAs we all know, revision is knowledge and knowledge is power. And if\nwe don\u2019t try to restrain that power we\ntend to lose our eyebrows and other\nbody parts. A decaying radioactive\nisotope, an un-grounded electrical\ncircuit, a Bunsen burner with a mischievous streak; all sources of power\nthat will do us a serious injury if we\ndon\u2019t take action to contain them.\nKnowledge is no different \u2013 it must be\ncontained.\nSecondly, why is it that, no matter how much revision we do, there\nalways seems to be more to do? Obviously, unbeknownst to the lecturers that set the exam questions,\nknowledge undergoes an exponential\nexpansion. Or, to put that in more\naxiomatic terms, knowledge begets\nknowledge. Like rabbits on a council\nestate. Due to the openness inherent\nin my revision notes (in a vain attempt to learn by sheer diffusion), the\nknowledge is free to wander the page\nand bed down with whatever it likes.\nI have woken on some mornings to\nfind embryogenesis shacked up with\nopioid pharmacology (Oh yeah, like\nyou wouldn\u2019t!). Since my notes are the\nfruit of a greater proportion of my life\nthan I\u2019m comfortable, hosing them\nwith cold water would probably give\nme a stroke. Therefore, the next best\nthing is that all knowledge needs to be\nenclosed separately.\nThis is why, from now on, all my revision notes are meticulously penned\nin by biro delineations. This is the\nonly way I\u2019ve found that can safely\ncontain the knowledge. It allows me to\nstep back from the page and breathe a\nsigh of relief. No matter how bad it all\nlooks, or how little (I fear) I know, I\ncan rest assured that I\u2019m safe because\nall the knowledge, in all its abstract\ninfinities, is bounded by the concrete\nconfines of red and blue ink.\nThis way, the revision doesn\u2019t get\nto me. I can then slip my arms back\ninside my straightjacket as the nurses\ntighten the straps for the night and\nrest my head against a padded wall\nand sleep peacefully.\nP.S. I do hope this works and doesn\u2019t\nturn out like the raptor paddock in\nJurassic Park. I have been sleeping less\nthan a metre away from notes on cancer and malignancy. Hm, clever girl...\n\u201cour only meas of\nescape is through a\npotentially weeks-long tunnel of\nmental diarrhoea\u201d\nRhysDavies contemplates the horror of revision\n\u201c...anonymous\nmarking will lead\nto students having\ngreater faith in the\nsystem.\u201d\nIs the marking system at Imperial fair enough?\n\n"
