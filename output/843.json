    "content": "Just ten pounds buys you entry to all of the Freshers' Week events below. Entertainment\nfills in the details....\nFresher s' Week Events Firstly, I must remind anyone who has ordered\nFreshers' Week tickets or Ents Cards (or both] to\ncollect them from the Union SCR Monday morning or\nafternoon-you will not be able to collect them on the\ndoor on Monday night. Anyone who has not bought\na ticket, shame on you, the only way you can redeem\nyourself is to buy one from the Union Office or the\nUnion SCR today.\nWhat have we got lined up for you then? Only one\nof the best Freshers' Weeks in England. We start off\non Monday 2nd October (tonight) with the New Year\nParty. This is headlined by The Four Brothers, the best\nband to come out of Zimbabwe. They have been\ngetting a lot of press lately with the release of their\nhighly acclaimed second LP 'Bros', and are one of\nJohn Peels fave bands; \"The guitar playing has been\nknown to make grown men cry\"\u2014John Peel. They\nare an excellent dance band.\nAlso in the Concert Hall is The Woodchildren who\nare four lovable mop-tops from Merseyside. With their\nunique dibble y guitar sound they have plucked their\nway into our major Freshers' Week slot after a run of\nmajor London Polytechnic dates. They replace\nSyndicate who recently split up. Check out the new\nalbum Shopaholic, it's great!\nBut that is only half of it. We have two excellent\nbands pre forming in the Lounge. One of them, The\nSandkings are soon to be touring with the Wonder\nStuff and have a similar sound to REM. The other, The\nKatydids are an in di pop band recently signed to a major record company.\nBut don't take my word for it-come and see for\nyourself. Also on the Monday we have a crazy mix\nof late bars, very late discos, films and fun which all\ngo together to provide an unbeatable night's entertainment.\nWednesday is Comedy Night when you can see\nsome of the best alternative comedy on the circuit.\nWe have Wack and Zan, a hilarious juggling act, Felix,\nan impressive stand up comedian and Sean Hughs,\nan entertaining impress a rio. The night is comp ered by\nIvor Dembina.\nThe week is rounded off by the big party on Friday,\nthe Freshers' Ball (don't bring your dinner jackets, it's not that sort of Ball). This is in a similar vein to the\nMonday night with late bars, late discos, food and fun.\nThis night features some of the best party bands in\ntown. Headlining is the Big Town Playboys, old\nfavourites of Imperial College, and supporting them\nis the Jivin' Instructors, you may have seen their\nnames on walls around London! We also have Dave,\nPuppy and the Happy Dogs-a band to miss at your\nperil.\nSo this is what's on-how much does it cost?\nMonday and Friday night are \u00a35 each and Wednesday\nis a mere \u00a33. You can, of course, buy a week ticket\nfor \u00a3 10 that gives you guaranteed entrance to all three\nnights. Tickets can be bought on the door (but please\nbe early to avoid disappointment) or from the Union\nSCR or Union Office on Monday.\nSo when Freshers' Week is over what other events\nare Ents putting on?\nEvery Friday night (bar the first one) Ents put on a regular 'Lounge' feature. This involves a band or\ncabaret act along with the Lounge disco and late bar.\nThe cost of these will be anything from \u00a32.50 to\nnothing. There will also be larger Carnivals once or\ntwice a term along the same lines as the Freshers Ball.\nThis brings up the subject of Ents Cards. These give\nyou reduced admission to all the Ents events except\nFreshers' Week. Large savings can be made for the\ninitial \u00a37 it will cost for the Ents card.\nIf you want to get involved with the Ents crew you\ncan see us at the Freshers' Fair where you can get\nsome information about us. Sign up, it's great!!!\nB.J.

    "content": "Sailing\nAt the end of last term a hand-picked squad of Sailing\nClub members gathered outside Beit Arch to be rushed\naway (eventually) to Coleraine (Nl) for the Old\nBushmills International Distillery Trip. This involved\ntasting whisky and then pretending to canoe the\nminibus back to the tents. The morning after, we\nfound that the locals had organised a24 hour dinghy\nrace as well, so as we were there, we split into two\nteams, jumped into a couple of boats and set off into\nthe breeze.\nThe first team got a good start and set off round\nthe course only to be caught up by the seconds in a mad orgy of glory-lust that left both boats tearing\nround the course at a remarkable speed. The wind\nsoon fell away to nothing and the firsts, with Richard\nat the helm, gradually crawled away whilst Liam, hero\nof these pages, went for a swim. By morning the firsts\nhad clawed their way up to second and were now\ngaining on the leader, whilst the seconds, in ninth\nplace overall, were immediately behind both the other\nuniversity teams; Edinburgh and Manchester.\nIn the final few hours the wind broke up and the\nfirsts unluckily missed all the good gusts and were\nunable to close in on their prey, the final positions'\nremained unchanged.\nWater Polo\nWe all like pleasure. Some of us even like pain!\nWhichever you get a kick from, come and join in with\nus. We've got both simultaneously in boundless\nquantities.\nEvery Monday and Friday evening, from 6.30pm, the Swimming and Water Polo Club gets together for\na training session. All levels of ability are welcome to\njoin in, from doggy-paddlers to would-be 'Matt\nBlondi's'. And if you think swimming to time\nschedules sounds painful, you'd be wrong! Great fun\nis had by all who come along.\nIf you've still got any energy left, from 7.30pm Water Polo is played. It's a fast, furious and\nexhilarating team sport (for those of you who don't already know) and can be played by both the ladies\nand the men on (comparatively) equal terms.\nSo don't be shy. 'Get yer kit off and join in! There\ncan't be any other way of keeping/getting fit that's so much fun.\nMonday and Friday evenings from 6.30pm at\nthe IC Leisure Centre.\nScience Fiction\nRighty-ho then, this is the welcome all! to ics f, the\nImperial College Science Fiction Society.\nIn case you miss us at Freshers' Fair, the first film\nof the year is BeetleJuice, an excellent modern horror\nmovie which frightens, when at all, through\npersonalities rather than special effects. This will be\nscreened on Tuesday 10th October at 7pm sharp (we\nreally mean this dear hearts) in MechEng 220, which\ncan be found by going to the main entrance to College\nin Exhibition Road, entering and then turning left.\nMembership is \u00a31.50, which lets you into this film free\nand all the rest of this year's films for 50p, with other\nsociety events at reduced rates, or even free!\nIf this film is not up your street (uncultured lout) or\nshould you be busy that night (what could be more\nPage 16\nfun than this?), but you're still interested in ics f's events, you can get on our mailing list by seeing us\nat Freshers' Fair or alternatively you can contact\nAmanda Baker, Physics 2, or ics f itself through the\nUnion Office, or come to one of the library meetings\non Thursday lunchtimes at 1pm. The library, our pride and joy, is situated down the\nstairs in the South West corner of Beit Quad. It really\nis a sight for sore eyes, to lovers of SF/F in any of its\ngene res. Borrowing is easy and free to members, and\nthe library functions as a nexus for many social events\non and off the SF theme.\nDrop in, we'd love to eat you!\nThe Mad Hatter.\nWing\nChun\nImagine yourself walking home at night, when a stranger approaches you and asks for some money.\nHe is keeping his right hand in his jacket pocket. What\nwould you do?\nIn China, hundreds of years ago, if somebody was\nto mug or attack you there would have been no army\nor police force to protect you. You had to defend\nyourself. For this reason the Chinese developed\nMartial Arts (Kung Fu in Chinese) as a form of self-defence. Wing Chun is a style of Kung Fu from\nsouthern China. It is the only Martial Art (bar one) to\nhave been developed by a woman-the Buddhist nun\nNg Mui. She developed a system of close quarter\ncombat that is efficient and economic in motion.\nRealising that a woman cannot compete with a man\nfor strength she based her system on speed and skill\nto overcome an opponents strength and size. Ng Mui\ntaught her system to a talented young female student,\nYim Wing Chun, after whom the system is named.\nWing Chun is an effective self defence system that\ncan be learnt in a relatively short period of time. It is\nnot a sport-when you are fighting for your life it is\nnot a game. Wing Chun can teach the weak to\novercome the strong and one person can defeat many.\nWing Chun will enable you to learn many possible\nresponses to a situation and although your response\nmay not be perfect, you stand a much better chance\nif you have trained in Wing Chun Kung Fu.\nNews\nThe Club had a very active summer and while many\nmembers of the College were holidaying in the sun,\na hard core of committed practitioners continued to\ntrain in night classes run by the Club.\nOur annual awards were held at the end of the\nsummer term, with trophies being awarded for skilled\nfighters. In April Moy Yat, one of Yip Man's disciples,\nvisited Imperial College and gave an impromptu\nseminar. He was extremely impressed with the\nstandard of Kung Fu here.\nWe held film shows and on August 27th we headed\nout to Herfordshire for the Summer Camp '89. This\nincluded an assault course complete with ambush\nattacks, a detailed discussion of first and second\nforms, a question and answer session on dummy\ntechniques and a barbeque. All this activity was\naccompanied by music from Laki. The Camp's spirit\ncontinued over to the next day's training at Imperial\nCollege, where a table fighting competition was held.\nMost recently we have held a reunion to allow old\nmembers of the Club to come and see how their Kung\nFu family is progressing and to show that even if they\nhad forgotten us, we hadn't forgotten them.\nFor those of you coming back from holiday, you will\nbe amazed to seethe progress your Kung Fu brothers\nand sisters have made. This progress and all the\nevents this summer have only been possible because\nof the endless enthusiasm and top class instruction\nprovided by Sifu Sid Sofos, who we are very\npri vele ged to have as our chief instructor.\nOld or new members wishing to train or view\ntraining sessions you will find us in the Union\nGym in Beit Quad at the following times:\nAdvanced\nMondays 7.30-9.30pm Thursdays 8.30-10.30pm Beginners\nWednesdays 1.30-2.30pm Fridays 4.30-6pm "

Go out and make the most o life; join a club, laugh a lot or just get pissed.\nFRESHERS' GUIDE\nFreshers' Week begins with a mass registration from\n9 'til 4 in the Junior Common Room, Sherfield\nBuilding. You will need your registration slip to obtain\nyour IC Union Card and, more importantly, your grant\ncheque (also available in the JCR). Union cards will\nbe available from the Senior Common Room in the\nUnion Building from 9 'til 5 each day except Tuesday.\nIt is well worth registering as quickly as possible since\nregistration will only be possible through room 343\nfrom 12 O 'clock Tuesday.\nOnce the formalities are over there is an address\nfrom the Rector, Professor Eric Ash at 10.30 on\nMonday, followed by CCU General Meetings in the\nafternoon. Monday evening's entertainment is\noutlined on page 12. Suffice it to say that this is the\nbest chance for you to 'get out there and meet\npeople.'\nTuesday is everybody's chance to find a new\npastime or follow an old one by touring the vast array\nof clubs and societies at the Freshers' Fair.

With the ensuing hangover you can do a good deed and have fun to boot by tid d ly winking down Oxford Street. If you've made it that far through\nFreshers' week, well done; maybe you'd like to see\nhow Marlowe, the FELIX private eye found his first\nday last year.\nIt had been a hard week, the kind of week that slugged\nyou across the face and made off with your bus pass,\nand I was on a tough case. I had been hired to\ninvestigate Imperial College's Fresher's Week.\nIt started on Monday. The place was full and I tried\nto blend in with the crowd. It didn't work: students\ndon't wear trenchcoats and carry loaded Colt 45s.I was in a hurry and I don't deal with small fry. I had\nto see the man at the top, the big cheese, the man\ncalled 'The Rector'.\nFor once, lady luck was on my side: the word was\nthat The Rector would be at a joint called the Great\nHall at 10am.I got there at 9. The place was empty\nso I went away and came back an hour later.\nNow the place was packed. At the far end of the\nroom I could just see the white haired figure of The\nRector. He was speaking but it didn't make much\nsense. He was talking about something called 'hard\nwork' but no-one seemed to be listening. It was then\nit hit me. I had been given a double dose of boredom.\nThe world went hazy and I collapsed. No one seemed\nto notice.\nI woke up, I looked around. The place was like Skid\nRow without the charm. I must have been at the New\nYear Party. I stood up, my legs objected. I sat down\nagain. 'Hey,' I said to a nearby kneecap, 'where am\nI?'

    "content": "Free money for students! Interested? Read on!\nGet what's coming to you\nEvery year many people, including students, fail to\nclaim their full entitlement to state benefits, because\nthey do not know what they can claim or how to go\nabout claiming it. Imperial College Union Welfare is\nrunning a 'Benefits and Rights' Information desk in the\nJCR, on 12th13 th October between 11.30am and\n3pm. Experts on Housing and Social Security Benefits\nwill be among the people present. Come along for\ninformation on the Benefits which you are entitled to,\nhow to go about claiming them and how to get the\nmaximum possible Benefit. Housing Benefit specialists.\nwill be available, with plenty of HB forms which they\ncan help you to fill in and will probably be able to\naccept your claim forms then and there. If you want\nto hand in your forms then you will need to bring\ncertain things with you: an official notification of your\nterm dates (College should have sent you one of\nthese, or you can get them from Registry in Sherfield),\nyour Education Grant Award Certificate, a copy of\nyour Deed of Covenant if you get one, a copy of a recent bank statement, proof of your rent, and a copy\nof your tenancy agreement. If you have trouble getting\nany of this information then come along to the JCR\nand find out where to get it, or what to do if you can't get it!\nOVERSEAS STUDENTS:\nDo you want a secure British education? If you are an\nOverseas Student, this may not be as simple as it\nsounds. Overseas Students run into all sorts of\nproblems while studying in this country. On Friday\n13th October Cathy Presland of UKCOSA (UK Council\nfor Overseas Students Affairs) will be at the\ninformation desk in the JCR to answer questions on\nm benefits, accommodation problems and visas.\nUKCOSA is an organisation set up to promote and\nprotect the interests of overseas students. It provides\nadvice, training and publications concerning issues\nfaced daily by students from abroad.\nHOW TO AVOID HOMELESSNESS\nRenting a flat is not as straightforward as it may at\nfirst appear. Not only do you have to find\naccommodation which you can afford (which isn't much fun, as anyone who has had to do it will know!),\nbut you have to make sure of your rights to avoid\neviction, raising of your rent and many other\nfrightening possibilities. If you want to find out more\nabout your rights as a tenant, then specialists will be\nin the JCR on both Benefits and Rights Days to answer\nall your questions, and to help you make sure that your\nperiod of tenancy is problem free.\nSURVIVING!\nThere are many other situations which may arise\nwhen it is important for you to know your rights. What\nhappens if your new Walkman chews up its first tape,\nyou find a slug in your lettuce, or your next door\nneighbour keeps you awake all night with loud music?\nThese are examples of some of the areas which the\n'Benefits and Rights' Campaign aims to address. As\nwell as the specialists on Benefits, Legal Rights etc.\nthe Union Welfare Adviser, Yve Posner, will be\navailable and is able to answer most of the questions\nyou might come up with! If you can't make it to the\nJCR on the 12th or 13th, she is available in her office,\nabove the Union office, between 12.30pm and\n5.30pm weekdays.\nThere may be some extra \u00a3\u00a3\u00a3\u00a3\u00a3's in the benefit system for you\nFAXFILE\n\u2022 Do you know what your rights are as a tenant?\nDid you know that most tenants cannot be evicted\nwithout a court order or that your landlord has a legal\nduty to carry out repairs whatever your contract says?\nAlso, it is possible to get your deposit back even\nthough your landlord is refusing to repay it-you just\nneed to go about things the right way.\nDo you know where to go to get housing advice?\nEvery Local Authority has a Tenancy Relations Officer\nand a Housing Advice Department there to help you.\n\u2022 Do students pay Income Tax? Well, you can earn\nup to \u00a32,785 in the current tax year before you have\nto start paying tax.\n\u2022 Legal Advice? Do you know where to get free legal\nadvice? Do you know what the Green Card Scheme\nis or fixed free advice? In London there are a large\nnumber of Law Centres where it is possible to get\ncompletely free legal advice from a qualified solicitor.\nThere are also other ways of getting reduced cost\nadvice.\n\u2022 Overseas students? Do you know what benefits you\ncan claim? Many overseas students are unable to\nclaim certain benefits.\nAre you allowed to work in the UK? If you look in\nyour passport you should be able to check your visa\nregarding this? Most overseas students are restricted\nfrom working but their wives can usually work\nwithout having to get a work permit.\n\u2022 Did you know that most British and EEC students\ncan claim Housing Benefit? An undergraduate with\nonly a student grant and paying rent of \u00a360 per week\ncan get up to \u00a327.40 per week Housing Benefit.\nA postgraduate with a SERC grant can get up to\n\u00a315.27 towards \u00a360 per week rent.\n\u2022 Prescription charges? Dental charges? Sight tests?\nGlasses?\n-Prescription charges are now \u00a32.80 per item\n-All NHS dental treatment is charged for unless\nyou are under 20. A simple check-up and clean\ncan cost \u00a310.\n-Sight tests are now \u00a310 unless you are under 19\nand the cheapest pair of glasses can set you back\n\u00a315-\u00a320.\nBUT all students are eligible to claim help towards\nthese charges and many qualify for completely free\ntreatment.\n\u2022 Are you a student with dependant children under\n18? If so then you can claim Child Benefit for them -it's currently \u00a37.25 per week per child.\nSingle parents can also claim One Parent Benefit,\ncurrently \u00a35.20 per week for the eldest child.\nIf your partner is working you might be able to claim\nFamily Credit (this varies according to income).\nFor more information on benefits and rights\ncontact Union Welfare Adviser, Yve Posner, via\nthe Union Office or come to the Benefits & Rights\nDays on 12th13 th October.\nUnion Welfare Officer Jackie Scott demonstrates the best way\nto get your Housing Benefit\nPage 6\n\n"

    "content": "In a last desperate bid to unscramble the government's higher education policy FELIX\nasked Kenneth Bryliantine, Minister of State for Quoting Statistics and Blaming the\nLast Labour Government at the Department of Education and Science, to explain.\nMinister Speaks Out\n'Firstly let me say this, I personally did myself go\nto University. Well do I remember my five happy years\nstudying Applied Mediterranean Studies at Oxfordthe balls, sailing every weekend and, of course,\nregular meals at high table. Let it not be said that I, Ken Bryliantine, do not understand the plight of the\nmodern student.\n'The Prime Minister, and I, of course, agree with her\ncompletely and wholeheartedly, feel that now the\ngovernment has solved all the country's ills, it is time\nto pass on our knowledge to the next generation\nwhether they like it or not.\n'The foremost, fundamental, principle aim of our\neducation policy is to bring education into the really-real real world of 1989.\n'Obviously it is unreasonable to expect all these\nDoctors and Professors to understand the\ncomplexities of our grand master plan but\nfundamentally we aim to introduce market forces. For\ntoo long Universities have been operating a closed\nshop: for too long they have insisted, unreasonably,\non only allowing those who are good at a subject to\nstudy it. In the incredibly-real real world of 1989 this\nis obviously ridiculous .\n'We will create new entrance requirements based\nnot on what you know but on what you can afford!\nDegrees will be rewarded to the highest bidder. We\nwill create a new Utopia of equality!\n'Just look at America. Where else can a man with\nthe IQ of a tomato buy himself enough qualifications\nto become Vice President? Where else can decent\ngod-fearing religious fundamentalists dictate what is\nto be taught? Where else but the Unified States of\nAmerica? Britain! A brave new Britain of tomorrow's Victorian values.\n'We want students to become more resourceful.\nThat is why grants are so small-it is to encourage\ninventiveness and entrepreneurship. Students must\ntake on jobs, several jobs each, to make ends meet.\nIt is an ideal opportunity to learn about the importance\nof money and even if they have to drop out, they will\nhave learnt one important fact central to our\nphilosophy: poor people lose.\n'Just think wha fa great advance student loans will\nbe. What better way is there to learn about debt than\nto spend your student life permanently in the red? It's brilliant-Nigel Lawson told me so.\n'Now, I know, and I am sincerely sincere in this, that\nyou Imperial students have special problems. I know\nthat we only provide \u00a319 to cover rent and I know\nabout the cost of housing in South Kensington\u2014I myself personally own three blocks of flats. But just\nthink what this little extra impossibility will do for your\npowers of entrepreneurship.\n'This Government's science policy is frequently\nattacked by politically motivated pink os who claim we\ndo not provide enough cash. This is totally and utterly\nwrong: we have a minister for science, the Rt Hon....\nThingy. A high profile job! But you must understand\nthat in the really very real real world of not quite but\ncoming up to 1992 we just cannot afford it.\n'Science CAN do without funding: did Einstein have\nfunding when he discovered Evolution-did he? Of\ncourse not! We propose a whole new form of\nsponsorship: the Rothmann's Cancer Research Fund,\nThe Macdonald's Nutritional Study Centre, The\nRonald Reagan Memorial Laser Laboratory. What a world of possibilities lies open ahead of us.\n'With the assistance of sensible students like\nyourselves we may soon achieve our goals. And we\nmust not forget that the majority of students are\nhappier, more energetic and prettier-in real terms-than under the last Labour Government.\n'Keep up the good work!'\nSince this article was written Mr. Bryliantine\nhas been promoted. His replacement in the post,\nJohn McNobody, has vowed to continue with his\npredecessor's policies 'but with a Scots accent'.\nBRITISH RAIL\nWe have lots of great jobs in all branches\nof engineering, research and general\nmanagement.\nFind out more from your Careers Service,\ncome and see me at the Careers Fair on\n2 November or contact me now:\u2014\nTim Steven,\nFl. 15, Room 11,\nSouthern House,\nBritish Rail (Southern),\nWellesley Grove,\nCroydon CR9 1DY Tel: 01-666 6872\n\n"

    "content": "Two Moon Junction\nBye bye w impish eighties heroes you have been\nforgotten. Slimy lizard Gordon Gekko of Wall Street\nand Micky Rourke's pretty boy from 9'A Weeks heed\nthe words: the dollar is no longer sexy and stripe y shirts and bonds are a bore. Okay, so this was always\ntrue but when Zaman King, the maker of 9% Weeks\ncasts a rough hunk of meat as the lead in his latest\nfilm you can bet that the New-Age Nineties are\nnervously starting to dawn.\nTwo Moon Junction takes sex back out of the city,\nbrings it down from the penthouse heights and lays\nit down gently to graze (and rut) in the plains of\nAmerica's South. The timeless South where another\nSouthern Belle, April (Sherilyn Fen), is reaching the\nseason of her life where all good girls of the oldest\nfamilies must put on their grandma's wedding dress\nand marry the boy next door: Mr Average-Preppy\n'Chad' (Martin Hewitt). But wait-the circus has come\nto town and I 'll be darned if riding in with it, in the\ntruck with his fight in' dog, it isn't the cockiest,\ncraziest son of a bitch straight out of April's wildest\nshower-room fantasy-latter-day Norse-god Perry\n(Richard Tyson). Stepping down from the rubber and\nchrome and straight out of a Levi's ad he's a rough-cut, long-haired bad boy dripping sex. Spitting out\ngravelling sounds through the swigs of Bourbon he's a cowboy-cum-philosopher. He's got an allergy to\nshirts and a gravity to women so when April takes her\nlittle sisters to the circus for a ride she starts to\nimagine she might quite like a ride herself.\nAt this point we all remember the reason we're here\nand the director obligingly throws reality out of the\nscript-room window. Next scene Perry pops around\nuninvited (?) to April's massive mansion for a casual\nshower. April is somewhat surprised at this and tells\nhim to 'Get out!'. But Perry knows and we know that\nwhat she really means is 'Get out of the shower, strip\nmy clothes off and teach me all about sex'. This he\nobligingly does, even thinking to tape the whole thing\nNewington Green\nentry \u00a32-3, food under \u00a35.\nAn evening at the Jazz Cafe involves being blasted\noff your feet or out of your seat by some of the best\njazz that London can offer. The Cafe is intimate (that\nis small) with the jazz band in the front room (where\nconversation is impossible) and piped to the back\nroom.\nThe bands change nightly, although old favourites\nplay there regularly, and range from trios to septets\n(probably the maximum number of people physically\npossible on the stage). The jazz itself covers the whole\nrange from modern to and fusion, so if you have any\nparticular likes or dislikes it's worth checking their\nlistings in Time Out. The place is uncomfortably\ncrowded at weekends but pleasantly packed for\natmosphere in the remainder of the week.\nThe Cafe is good: app et ising vegetarian and vegan\nfood with all main dishes under a fiver. You can book\na table and listen to the jazz in more comfort, but you\nhave to eat, and they won't hold the table after\n8.30pm; otherwise it's unlikely you'll find somewhere\nto sit after about 8 o 'clock. House wine is around \u00a35\nfor her further study later on.\nFrom here on in you get what you paid for\u2014\nsomething for the ladies and something of course for\nthe men. As an unexpected bonus some of the dead\na bottle and they have about ten different bottled\nbeers on offer, as well as more expensive named\nwines.\nOctober sees the Cafes 1000th performance, so\nthis would be a night to avoid unless you enjoy\nsuffocating, and also a Jazz Against Apartheid\nevening and a photographic exhibition.\nGetting there from College is relatively easy. A number 73 bus takes you to the door. Getting home\nmay be more of a problem unless you catch the last\n73, but there is a new night bus service that will get\nyou as far as Trafalgar Square. To get in costs \u00a32-3,\nalthough there are student concessions (mind you, the\nmonthly programme implied these were for NUS\nstudents only!) and there is a temptation to drink a lot of wine. It's not a cheap evening out, but it does\nbeat sitting in the local pub listening to the juke box.\nUz W pan love lines of bland sincerity wrinkle on the\ntransatlantic flight (as ever) and spike some of the\nsilliest moments with the chance for a laugh. The rest\nis hairy chests and pliant beasts: enjoyable smut.\nK9 There's an old Indian saying: \"Man who jogs in Hyde\nPark gets dogs hit on trainers\". By analogy with this\nintuitive maxim one might also venture: \"Man who\nwatches formula film gets bullshit in face\". And a very\nappropriate analogy it would be for the latest\ndroppings from the 'Man-and-best-friend-beast' stable\nK9. The unfortunate distinction remains that in public\nparks throughout the country people are trying, for the\nsake of their communities' health, to clean up these\ncanine deposits. The film industry, in contrast, is still\nhappily crapping away to the offence of viewers'\nsensibilities. So for those with an interest in the manmade environment or students of canine stools here\nis an analysis of the latest outbreak of this cinematic\ndisease.\nJames Belushi is the unfortunate 'star' trying not\nto soil himself as he plays maverick narcotics cop\nThomas Dooley. Dooley is too wacky and dangerous\nto take on a human partner but the scriptwriter soon\ndelivers him a package deal. Dooley's ideal new\npartner is equally full of crap and just as unafraid to\nspread it around in public, coming in the form of a German Shephard dog by the name of Jerry Lee (what\nelse?). After a shaky start together they catch the cut-out baddies and risk their futures in the films.\nThe moral of this story then: \"In public parks and\ncinemas both, be careful where you tread!'\nMAC\nPage 13\nThe Jazz Cafe\n\n"

Ten\nout of the 24 telephones in Selkirk and Tizard Halls\nwere stolen the day after they were fitted. Each of\nthe telephones is worth about \u00a330.\nWarden John Hassard said that he did not know\nwho the culprits were and said they could have been\nSummer Accommodation Centre residents, students\nor outsiders. He said that there had been no thefts of\ntelephones during 88-89 when the old system was\nin place.\nThe stolen phones were all replaced within a day\nand the cost of the new phones will be borne by the\nCollege Telephone Account. The cost of any further\nstolen phones will be met by the hall.\nThe new phones replaced the old system, which Dr\nHassard described as 'appalling and dangerous'. He\npointed out that if the phones were damaged it was\nnot only inconvenient but also dangerous in the event\nof a fire. The phones have now been secured.\nBirdathon\nSilwood Park Natural History Society are taking part\nin a Birdathon against Oxford University on October\n28.

The motion, proposed by\nEdgar Denny and seconded by R.

It goes on to claim\nthat 'to defeat this tax we must be prepared to break\nthe law.'\nThe Freshers' UGM will be held in the Junior\nCommon Room, Sherfield at 1pm on Thursday.\nScholarships\nFinal year undergraduates should hurry if they wish\nto study cheaply in the USA next year.

    "content": "THE\nDELATOR\nCOLUMN\nby Paul Shanley\nInsist on your right to pass through the manual gate at Underground\nStations, says Paul Shanley\nSnookered\nBarrier Methods\n\u2022\nthe sort you buy from newsagents. The second\nmethod requires two video recorders and a blank\nvideotape. With these three items, you need never pay\nyour fare again.\nThat is why the barriers don't work. That is why\nthey don't justify the massive investment that London\nRegional Transport has placed in them. But so what;\nthey aren't doing anyone any harm, are they? Well,\nthe truth is, they might not have done yet, but it's only\na matter of time.\nA recent independent safety report carried out by\nan agency working for the LRT watchdog The\nPassenger Complaints Authority revealed that during\ncertain types of power failure, the barriers close\nshut-not open, thereby trapping commuters within\nthe closed confines of station exits.\nFurthermore, at certain stations contained within\nthe limits of the Circle Line, the number of barriers in\nuse is less than is necessary to allow a rapid and safe\nflow of passengers through the automatic gates. In\nthe rush hour, it is not uncommon for the queue of\ntravellers to spill right down the stairs and onto the\nplatform.\nThese two faults are more than inconvenient-they\nare potential death traps. If, God forbid, another Kings\nCross happens, the station staff will not be able to\nclear commuters away in time.\nThere are also a number of peripheral arguments as\nto why the introduction of the gates was ill-conceived.\nThey are virtually impossible to use by blind people\nwith guide dogs, disabled people and people carrying\na lot of luggage to name but a few. LRT maintain that\nstation staff are on hand to help wherever necessary.\nThis isn't always true, and in any case, those\nmentioned above shouldn't need to seek help.\nThe London Evening Standard has been\ncampaigning for the abolition of these death traps.\nThey advocate that travellers should insist on the right\nto use the manual gate whenever leaving a station\nequipped with automatic barriers. This is a view I support. South Kensington Station-the nearest one\nto College that has these barriers installed-seems\nintent on making commuters use them. Last month\nI spent fifteen minutes arguing with a jobs worth at\nthe station to let me use the manual gate. In this time,\nhe let five other people pass through ahead of me,\nbecause their tickets were the old type that didn't fit\nin the new machines-why was I any different?\nWhen you travel by Tube into College\u2014or anywhere\nelse for that matter-insist on your right to pass\nthrough the manual gate. It is only in this way that\nLRT can be brought to their senses.\nAgainst mounting pressure from its customers,\nLondon Regional Transport is continuing with its\ncampaign to equip all London Underground stations\nwith automatic ticket barriers. At a time when the\nauthority should be concentrating on more pressing\nmatters, such as better security for its staff, more\nreliable services and much safer travel for its late-night commuters (particularly on the quieter routes\nsuch as the Northern Line), it sees fit to continue with\nthis course of action.\nAutomatic barriers were introduced to combat the\never increasing problem of fare evasion. Something\nneeded to be done. With LRT losing more and more\nmoney each year, it was left up to the fare-paying\npassengers to sub sid is e those travelling free.\nUnfortunately, this particular nut has been cracked\nwith a very large and potentially dangerous\nsledgehammer.\nTo address the problem of using the machines as\na tool to catch the fare-evade rs is to realise that they\ndon't perform this task adequately. A distant cousin\nof the ticket barrier was introduced at about the same\ntime-the all-singing, all-dancing ticket machine.\nThese differ greatly from their predecessors-they\nissue return tickets, they issue child tickets and they\nissue one-day travelcards. Fare evasion has never\nbeen so easy. The most common way to fiddle is to\nbuy a child ticket and use that. There is no-one to stop\nyou buying the ticket, because you've got it out of\na machine. There is no-one to collect your ticket at\nthe other end, because it is collected by a machine.\nOkay, that leaves the third problem-ticket\ninspectors. There is less chance of finding one of\nthese on the Tube than there is of spotting Lord Lucan\nriding Shergar. Since the introduction of the barriers,\nI have been asked to produce a ticket only once by\nan inspector. This happened a fortnight ago late at\nnight on Victoria Station. I was just about to admit\nto myself that LRT had changed their ways when I was approached by a second man. He informed me\nthat the 'inspector' was Jeremy Beadle and had I spotted the hidden camera.\nThere are two lesser documented methods of not\npaying which I won't describe in too much detail. The\nfirst involves careful use of a one-day travelcard-Snooker's governing body, the WPBSA, finds itself\ndesperately in need of sponsors for two of its ranking\ntournaments this year, with the current season\nalready underway. Maybe this would be a good time\nfor the association to examine the reasons behind this\ninstead of desperately rallying around to attract likely\ncandidates.\nThe problem is the vast amount of money required\nto cover such an event. Unless a company's name is\n\u2022synonymous with the tournament\u2014such as\nEmbassy's endorsement of the world championships,\nthe \u00a31/4m or so outlay represents poor value for\nmoney.\nIt all stems back to the domination of the game by\naccountants and leisure groups in the early 80s. At\none time, if a player didn't belong to Matchroom,\nFramework or one of the other professional\nmanagement companies, then they had little chance\nof getting anywhere in the game.\nCertainly, the continuing argument between Barry\nPage 14\nHearne and the WPBSA has done nothing to improve\nits image-an image that has been shaken by\nallegations of drug-taking, match-rigging and off-baize\ndisrepute by some of the more boisterous players.\nThe Football League introduced a ruling a few years\nago banning the ownership of more than one club by\nan individual. Snooker could do well to consider this\nproposal in their own game. Even if they don't take\nas radical a step as this, they could at least limit the\nnumber of full-time professionals that a manager or\ngroup can control at any one time. This would restrict\nthe bully-boy tactics of certain managers in\nthreatening to withdraw all their players from a tournament if their conditions were not met.\nThe away from the table antics of the Higgins',\nWhites and Stevens' of this world are not what is\nrapidly bringing the game into a state of disorder and\nchaos. The real hooligans are the men in suits who\noccupy the back rows of arenas with management\ncontracts in one hand and a cheque book in the other.\nTrading\nPlaces\nThe successor to John Smith, present College\nSecretary has been appointed. The new supremo,\nAngus Fraser, is to be known as the Managing\nDirector of Imperial College. I look forward to any\nother changes that may be brought in, to accompany\nsuch an appointment.\nWith the apparent need for Imperial to create such\na post, it will surely not be long before Imperial College\nHoldings pic is trading on the stock exchange floor.\nWho will benefit from such a share offer? Why, the\nstudents of Imperial College of course. The\nopportunity to participate in this flotation is one that\nwill be regarded with dubious optimism. For a company to be unleashed onto, and sold to, the people\nwho already own it leaves a very bitter taste. It is hard\nto imagine who could conceive such an idea....\n\n"

I should only like to add my\nwelcome and a few words of advice.\nI know too many people who did not make the most\nof their Freshers' week; they all regretted it. This is\nyour best chance to meet people before they\nhermetically seal themselves in their social shells. Go\nto the Ents events this week and go to the Freshers'\nFair. If you do nothing else all week you will still have\nmade some friends.\nI can offer no better advice than to enjoy your time\nat Imperial. Ignore the Rector's twaddle, which he will\ninevitably spout at the Freshers' reception, about\nmaking the most of London as a cultural centre: most\nof us can't afford to attend concerts and opera. Try\nlooking further afield than just IC however. The\nUniversity of London Union offers some worthwhile\nclubs and events, which are very cheap.\nEnough of the advice; mine is as much a pile of\nopinionated rubbish as anyone else's. On to more\nserious matters. This week's news covers a story on\nthe pos sib lit y of fees chargeable to students. The\nwhole idea has yet to be formally considered by the\nheads of Universities, but it must inevitably happen.\nI say this with regret because the reason for the move\nwill not be a hard-line approach by the Committee of\nVice Chancellors and Principals; it will be financial\npressure brought to bear by the Government's tightfisted funding of higher education. If Britain's Universities are not funded sufficiently they will have\nno choice but to increase fees and charge them to\nstudents. It should be noted that the Government has\nnot promised to fund the fee increases fully\u2014\nsho lar ships are usually for the few: I wonder how long\nit will be before corruption spreads and they are only\nfor the wealthy with highly paid accountants and\nchildren brought up on scholarship exams? The idea\nstinks but then so do the rest of this Government's 'bright ideas' on education. (Before ConSoc come\nwing eing, chargeable fees are an idea originated by\nKenneth Baker and his sidekick Jackson; so they are\nGovernment ideas.)\nCloser to home I have to admit to some amusement\nat the motion to be considered at Thursday's UGM.\nHave its authors gone mad? Even if IC Union did\n'demand' that the College did not hand over names\nand addresses to the Poll Tax register, the College\ncould not possibly comply. They may be open to\nnegotiation on most matters, but when asked to break\nthe law, the College is bound to refuse. The demand\nis as constructive as asking the College to ban Polish\nstudents from the College. The debate should be\nworthwhile, however, since it will allow the Union to\nformulate some policy on Poll Tax, now that we have\na clearer view of what it entails.\nThe Rector is a conniving g it. I hear he claims that\nhe is worried for the safety of Chinese students. This\nis why he cannot give much from his personal\nallowance to help them. If he did, the logic\n(somehow?) goes, he would endanger the future of\nChinese students at IC and their families in mainland\nChina. More twaddle, Eric!

    "content": "College plans Nightline eviction\nImperial College plans to oust West London Nightline\nfrom its present IC site to provide more student\naccommodation. The counselling service run by\nstudents is currently in Princes Gardens.\nThe decision to change the college's support from\nprovision of accommodation to a cash grant, like\nthose provided by other London colleges, was taken\nat a meeting of the College Management and Planning\nGroup over the summer. The proposal was approved\nby last year's Union President, Nigel Baker, and by\nDon Adlington, the College Student Counsellor.\nNightline have been offered one year in which to find\nalternative accommodation.\nThe Chairman of the Nightline Steering Committee,\nAnn Conlan of Kings College, who received\nnotification of the decision last week, said that she\nwas 'very disturbed' by it. She said that the\ncommittee had discussed the accommodation\narrangements at its last meeting in April and were very\nhappy that IC provided accommodation. She felt this\nshould continue as it provided continuity and added\nthat she would be calling an emergency meeting of\nthe committee to discuss the matter.\nCollege Assistant Finance Officer, Malcolm\nAldridge, said that as Imperial had provided the\naccommodation for the past 8 or 9 years, it was felt\nthat it was 'time someone else took a turn'. He\npointed out that the rooms involved would be released\ninto the college accommodation system and that there\nwas 'no intention to precipitate the demise of\nNightline'.\nThe Rector, Professor Eric Ash, admitted that there\nmight be some problems with the upheaval but said\nthat since IC had been 'taking the major load it seems\nreasonable for the load to be taken by someone else'.\nProfessor Ash added that he felt it was 'worthwhile\ncontinuing to support Nightline' since he felt 'it's the\nsort of thing where one phone call could be critical'.\nThe level of financial support from each college is\napproximately 30 pence per student.\nCollege Tutor David Goodgame said he would be\nraising the matter at the next Union Welfare\nCommittee and said that his concern was whether\nstudents would suffer from the move. He felt that as.\nthe service was used by students they should be\ninvolved in the decision.\nUnion President, Neil McCluskey, quoted the\naverage cost of a call to Nightline as \u00a35 and said that\nhe felt this was rather on the expensive side if the call\nwas merely for information. He pointed out that in\naddition to the colleges' contributions, each student\nunion also contributed to the service's running costs.\nThe current contribution from Imperial College Union\nis \u00a3700 per year.\nMr McCluskey went on to say that he 'really didn't know enough about the situation to comment' and\nsaid that 'I 've been here five years and I 've never used\nNightline. Maybe that's an indicator in itself. He felt\nthe question of Nightline's existence should be\ndiscussed in the light of the fact that organisations\nsuch as the Samaritans existed and that perhaps the\nmoney would be better spent supporting a student\nservice within the Samaritans.\nChinese students still suffering\nChinese students at Imperial have found themselves\nout of pocket following their efforts to keep in touch\nwith friends and relatives in mainland China during last\nJune's student uprisings.\nThe students spent over \u00a32000 pounds on faxes\nand gestures of support. Last year's IC Union\nPresident, Nigel Baker, verbally agreed to help with\nsome of the costs and the Chinese Students Scholars'\nAssosiation has presented a claim for \u00a3470 to the\nUnion.\nThis year's Union President, Neil McCluskey , has\nreceived an offer of \u00a3200 from the Rector's Personal\nAllowance, which is granted by College to dispose at\nhis own discretion. The Rector has also suggested\nthat an appeal be launched and will be making a personal donation.\nMr McCluskey said that he was 'pretty\ndisappointed' and that he 'did expect the Rector to\ncontribute the whole sum'. He said that as the sum\nhad been borne by one student, he would be taking\na claim to the first Council of term to ask for the\nrelease of the remaining money. This would then be\nreimbursed by any money raised from an appeal. He\npointed out that the Union had already made a contribution to the students in the form of free\ntransport and publicity.\nHe welcomed the idea of an appeal to help raise\nmoney to assist Chinese students who were\nexperiencing hardship and also to publicise the plight\nof the students and the progress of events in China.\nSuggestions for the appeal include collecting whilst\nUnion Cards were issued, publishing features in FELIX\non the background to the situation and the special\ndifficulties being faced by Chinese students and\norganising a fund-raising event of some kind.\nStudents may pay \u00a350,000 fees\nUniversity heads are to consider charging students full\nfees after a meeting last week. The new scheme could\nmean a fees bill of up to \u00a350,000 to a five year\nmedical student.\nThe Committee of Vice Chancellors and Principals\n(CVCP) decided to consider the option of full fees at\na meeting last Thursday after a reinforcement of the\nGovernment's aim to double the number of students\nin higher education in 25 years. A spokesman from\nthe CVCP told FELIX that they were 'looking at all the\npossible options that there were.' Thursday's meeting, which passed the motion to consider full fees\nin further discussions, was a non-decision making one.\nThe idea of charging full fees is to be considered\nwith a scheme of scholarships from the Government's funding of higher education, which the CVCP hopes\nwould meet all or part of the cost.\nAs a member of the CVCP, the Rector, Professor\nEric Ash, told FELIX that the meeting was 'divided.'\nHe added that the majority in favour of the move was\n'not very big.' Professor Ash voted against the\nmotion, which he felt did not gain much enthusiasm\nfrom the Department of Education and Science and\nthe Secretary of State for Education, John\nMacGregor.\nUniversities are currently able to charge students\nfor fees above their local education authority grant\nsince there is no provision in the law to prevent them.\nThe Royal College of Art in South Kensington is\ncharging incoming postgraduate students \u00a3110 per\nyear for fees. A spokesman told FELIX that the\nCVCP's decision was 'of interest' to the RCA, but\nadded that the proposal was 'vague.'\nIf the CVCP decide to charge full fees for courses,\nscience students could be faced with a bill of \u00a36000\nper year of study, with no guarantee of funding from\nthe Government.\nPage 3\n\n"

    "content": "Bob Speer previews Paul Davies' forthcoming lecture\nThe birth of the cosmos\nWednesday October 4th at 12.30pm in the Great Hall\nSherfield is certainly a date to put in your diaries and\nserious devotees are advised to get there early!\nAuthor of 17 books and well known science\npopulariser Paul Davies will be on hand lecturing and\ntalking to all a ff ici on a dos from about Noon onwards\nin the Great Hall. His theme will be \"The Birth of the\nCosmos\".\n\"Like many compelling images, it may turn out to\nbe a mirage, but for the first time in the history of\nscience we can form a conception of what a complete\nscientific theory of the world will look like.\"\nA new theory of the universe is emerging from\nrecent discoveries in fundamental physics and\ncosmology. Some scientists now believe that all of\nnature is ultimately under the control of a single\nsuper force, which weaves together space, time and\nmatter into a unified field theory. Bringing together the\nfrontiers of high energy particle physics and\ncosmology, the super force explains what caused the\nbig bang that gave birth to the universe, and how the\nfoundations for the cosmic structures we now see\nwere forged in the microseconds that followed. It also\nsuggests a bizarre new idea-that space and time are\nin reality eleven-dimensional, with the unseen\ndimensions of space masquerading as nuclear and\nelectromagnetic forces.\nSpeaking with clarity and elegance Paul Davies,\nrecently described in the New York Times as \"one of\nthe most adept science writers on either side of the\nAtlantic\", relates the story of these awesome new\nadvances:\nPaul Davies, himself a research scientist in this\nsubject area, believes that we might soon realise\nman's age-old dream-a unified theory of all\nexistence.\nPaul Davies is Professor of Theoretical Physics at\nthe University of Newcastle upon Tyne. He holds a doctorate from the University of London where he\nspent eight years as a lecturer in mathematics. His\nres each has ranged across much of fundamental\nphysics and cosmology, and he has acquired an\ninternational reputation as a science populariser\u2014\nOther Worlds, The Runaway Universe, The Edge\nof Infinity and God and the New Physics received\nworld-wide acclaim. He also writes regularly for The\nGuardian, The Economist and a number of science\nperiodicals, and frequently contributes to television\nand radio broadcasts.\nWe understand that the IC Bookshop will be\narranging a display of Paul Davies' books in the Lobby\nof the Great Hall after the lecture and there should be\nplenty of opportunity for book signing.\nA guide to London's secondhand music shops\nCheap Cutsby Chris Leahy\nBeing poor students we all love a bargain. However,\nfor those of us who cannot exist without spending\nnext week's rent on black vinyl or silver CD, the\nchallenge of undercutting Virgin's Megadeal on this\nweek's chart becomes as much a necessity as a pleasure. So where in this great metropolis, the very\nhub of the music 'biz', does J. Student go to get\nquality music at cheap o prices?\nLet's face it, unless you really want Singalonga Max\nVol V or Hooked on Classics for a bargain fiver, the\nsales held by the major chain stores are pretty useless\nfor picking up real bargains. Virgin Megastore and\nHMV on Oxford Street and Tower Records at\nPiccadilly Circus all claim to be the biggest/best record\nstore in the known universe and can on occassions\nbe useful for information on new releases. However,\nfor that limited edition pink vinyl EP needed to\ncomplete a cherished collection or just to obtain a few\ncheap records it is necessary to go and root around\nLondon's second-hand record shops.\nPage 8\nBy far the biggest 'chain' is Notting Hill Record,\nTape and Video Exchange which has four branches\nat Notting Hill Gate and can also be found in Goldhawk\nRoad, Shepherds Bush and Camden Town. As\nindicted by the name, they buy and sell records, tapes,\nCDs, videos (music and film, including those 'adult'\nmovies which I 've heard about but never seen) and\nalso have branches for books and musical\ninstruments. They will buy anything whatsoever and\nresell it at the going rate, periodically reducing the\nprice until someone buys it. So you can watch your\ncoveted item get cheaper until you can afford it, or\nuntil some bastard buys it before you. Records start\nat \u00a36, CDs at \u00a310, but there is also a department for\nreal rarities and a bargain basement (Singalonga Max\n50p). In central London, Reckless Records in Berwick\nStreet is always worth visiting, as it tends to get\nrecent material almost on release (unwanted review\ncopies mostly) and is a little cheaper than the\ncompetition (LPs \u00a35, CDs \u00a38.50). Runaway Records\nin Neal Street, Covent Garden recently opened and\nis a welcome addition despite its erratic opening\nhours. Just by Leicester Square tube is Steve's Sounds, which is not exactly second-hand but the\nprices are and they always seem to have some\nreduced stock.\nFurther out of town are Ruthless Records on\nPutney High Street and Honest John's( although I 'll\nbet he isn't) on Portobello Road. This article would be\nincomplete without a mention for Camden Market\nand its plethora of bootleggers. Their wares range\nfrom last night's big gig in London to the likes of Led\nZeppelin's US tour of 1975. Expect to pay around \u00a34\nfor a sixty minute cassette and always insist on\nhearing the quality first.\nOther genres are also well represented. For jazz try\nDobell's on Tower Street (WC2) and James Asman\n(New Row). He is a respected critic and his staff are\nalways helpful and comprehensively knowledgeable.\nClassical music is best sought at Farringdon\nRecords on Cheapside or Holborn. The very\natmosphere of the place will convert your tastes and\nthere are so many budget price recordings that you\nare spoilt for choice. Also worth a visit is Charing\nCross Records at Cambridge Circus.\nSo, a selection for the vinyl junkies to look for. There\nare many more, especially in Soho, but you can find\nthose for yourself whilst seeking that last elusive piece\nof plastic.\n\n"

This was one of those occasions, a competition to write up a scientific paper, Crick\nand Watson's1953 announcement of the famous double-helix strut ure of DNA, in the style of\nparticular newspapers. Below, you will find Narmada de Silva's winning entry and two of the\nrunners up. A report on the BAAS proper will appear on Friday.\nFINANCIAL TIMES\u2014Narmada de Silva\nPhosphate dies ter groups\nset to claim market lead\nA structure for the salt of Deoxyribose Nucleic Acid\n(DNA) has been proposed by J.D. Watson and\nF. C.H. Crick of the Medical Research Council Unit for\nthe Study of the Molecular Structure of Biological\nSystems (MRCUSMSBS), the Cambridge-based\nCavendish Laboratory announced yesterday.\nThis is based on trans-atlantic collaboration with the\nNational Foundation for Infantile Paralysis (NFIP)\nsupporting much of the research, hence a possible\ntake-over bid for the Wellcome Foundation cannot be\nruled out.\nThe novel structure has two right-hand helical\nchains of phosphor dies ter groups with opposing atom\nsequences centered around a common axis. The\nstructure is an open one with a high water content,\nbut the forthcoming privatisation may result in a stream-lining of the molecule as water becomes less\nfreely available and the structure becomes more\ncompact, in accordance with the prevalent market\ntrends.\nAs seen from the price at the close of trading\nyesterday BOC shareholders have been quick to\nrealize the importance of hydrogen-bond joints\nbetween .single bases in each chain. These pairing s of purine and pyr imi dine are not freely determined but\none chain sequence will define the other, reflecting\nthe current restrictions in manufacturing industry.\nThe Dow Jones index is steady at present but the\npossible replication mechanisms are being keenly\nexplored and observation of the price of Rank Xerox\nmay give an indication of when a suitable copying\nprocess for this genetic material had been achieved.\nTHE SUN\u2014Fran Tattersall\nMystery chemical\nOur eggheads crack it\nTwo scientists in Britain are the WINNERS of a weird\ncompetition. This is the race to work out the design\nof a MYSTERIOUS CHEMICAL called DNA. DNA is\npart of every human body from Thatcher's to Sam\nFox's but NOBODY KNEW WHAT IT WAS LIKE... 'til\nnow!! In Cambridge, brainy Englishman Francis Crick\nand Yankee helper Jim Watson have beaten American\nLabs to it! And today we've got complicated scientific\npapers to PROVE it! They've even built a model of the\n. chemical, it looks like a GIANT CORKSCREW, but this\nis A LOT BIGGER than the real thing.\nYou and I may not understand the jargon of\n'molecular biology' as the subject is called. But it's good to know that the b of fins are finding out more\nand more about how our bodies work, and this shows\nBRITAIN is one of the BEST when it comes to BRAINS.\nWhat do they get as a prize for their hard work? Hearty\ncongratulations from failed scientists elsewhere. And\nwho knows, maybe another NOBEL PRIZE for the\nBritish?\nTHE SUN\u2014Mark Weatherall\nBritish b of fins' breakthrough\nNature article shows the way\nThe scientific world was STUNNED this week by\noutstanding British b of fins Francis Crick and James\n'Jim' Watson. Whizzkids Watson and Crick, working\nin Cambridge's world-famous Cavendish Laboratory,\nCRACKED a problem that has taxed top scientists for\nyears. In their paper in the highly respected journal\nNature they solve the structure of mystery substance\nDeoxyribose Nucleic Acid, DNA.\n\u2022They beat American Nobel Prize winner Linus\nPauling to the discovery.\n\u2022 They dismiss other people's work.\n\u2022 They EXPLAIN just how they found the right\nanswer.\nScientists think DNA may be the stuff that makes\nus what we are. Now these courageous Cambridge\nworkers have shown the way scientists everywhere\nare FRANTICALLY changing their ideas about DNA.\nOdd couple, balding Crick and boyish Watson\nworked DAY AND NIGHT for two years. Now their\nresults are out, they plan to step up the pace and stay\nONE STEP AHEAD of the competition.\n\u2022 Has Japan gone Green? This depends on who you\nbelieve. At a recent government inspired conference\nin Tokyo, the massed ranks of the great and the good\nincluding the heads of the World Bank, the United\nNations Environment Programme and the World\nMeteorological Organisation praised the Japanese\ncontribution to environmental protection.\nElsewhere various non governmental organisations\nincluding Friends of the Earth attacked Japanese\ninvolvement in mass deforestation. Meanwhile, the\nTokyo Government has announced the provision over\nthree years of $2,250 million in overseas\nenvironmental aid.\n\u2022 Legislation, just introduced by the Indian\nParliament, will make AIDS an officially not if i able disease. The bill requires regional health authorities\nto coordinate the counseling and treatment of those\ninfected by HIV. It also imposes criminal penalties on\nHIV infected people who knowingly donate blood or\norgans. The Delhi Government has set aside $10\nmillion for the scheme which could require the\ncountry's1450 registered sufferers to be rounded up\nand placed in special centres: centres which have yet\nto be built.\nIn Europe, British and French health officials have\ndiffered a decision over whether to cut short a trial\nof the anti AIDS drug AZT despite the apparent\nsuccess of US based trials. The Europeans claimed\nthat the American evidence was insufficient.\n\u2022 Exxon, the accident prone oil company, have\nofficially called off cleaning up operations for the\nAlaska oil slick despite the fact that many miles of\ncoastline remain badly affected. Alaskan State\nGovernor Steve Cowper announced that the state,\nunlike the oil company, will continue with the work\nand forward at least part of the $21 million bill to\nExxon.\nExxon denies it is pulling out, saying that it has\nalready spent $1,000 million and is leaving behind a crew of 300 to help. According to the latest figures,\nsince the spillage the oil slick has killed over 34,000\nbirds and almost 1000 otters.\n\u2022 Bones thought to belong to the infamous Nazi\ndoctor Josef Mengele have been taken to West\nGermany for DNA fingerprinting. Mengele's relatives\nhope that the tests will dispel doubts that he is still\nalive and well and hiding in Latin America. They may\nnot be so lucky; according to state prosecutor Hans\nKlein, the bones are ten years old and were buried for\nseven, any remaining traces of DNA may be too small\nto detect.\n\u2022 More bones, this time belonging to American\nIndians. The Smithsonian Institute have agreed to\nrelease 18,600 sets of Indian bones to their\ndescendants. They have, however, hit a problem with\nredistribution: Indian tribes tended to move about and\nbones found in one territory may not belong to the\nancestors of the current inhabitants. To try and\nresolve the problem the Institute has proposed a$2.25 million research project involving\nanthropologists and forensic scientists to try and\nmatch tribes and bones.\nPage 7\n\n"
