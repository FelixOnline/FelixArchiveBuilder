The complaint seems to\nhave been made in response to a\npost a candidate made on Live! (the\nonline CGCU newspaper). The post\ninsinuated that Mr Collins had not\nbeen entirely truthful in his communications with candidates.\nShortly afterwards, Mr Collins\nsent an email to the candidate in\nquestion, which included language\nthat implied that disciplinary action\nwould be recommended against\nthe candidate. The candidate then\nasked for the post to be removed.\nIt seems that this candidate felt\ndiscriminated against by Mr Collins for this and other reasons, and\ntherefore filed a complaint. Other\ncomplaints against Mr Collins\nwere also discussed by the Executive, who met in closed session last\nThursday (which means the media\nhad no access to the proceedings)\nto discuss them. Felix is not privy to\nthe details of the complaints.\nSecrecy\nAt the closed session, Mr Collins\npresented his defence against the\nallegations of bias. However, Exec\nvoted to remove him as Returning\nOfficer with immediate effect.\nJohn appears to have taken the\ndecision very badly, and was later\nseen in the Quad haranguing at\nleast one member of the five-strong\nExec with expletives.\nUp until Tuesday this week, the\ncandidates had no idea what had\noccurred, as the meeting had taken\nplace in closed session. They were\nnot aware Mr Collins had been removed as Returning Officer for\nalleged bias, or that Eric Lai had\ntaken over the role for the time be-ing. An email was received by all\ncandidates reminding them to send\ncampaign material for approval\nto elections@imperial.ac.uk only,\nrather than copying Mr Collins in\n(as had previously happened).\nNeither the removed Returning\nOfficer nor Mr Lai would reveal any\nfacts about what occurred; the details were not made public until the\nCourt Chair, Hamish Common, was\ninvolved.\nThe long arm of the Court\nMr Collins was clearly very unhappy with the decision, and was\napparently offered the chance to\nreconvene Exec to discuss the\ncomplaint again rather than possibly hold up the election. Felix can\nonly assume he rejected this offer,\nas the newly-created Union Court\nhas been dragged into play.\nAn oddity of this situation is that\nMr Collins is not the one who made\nthe appeal to Court; instead, the appeal was made by Jad Marrouche,\nRSCU President, who was not\npresent at the Exec meeting and\nhas so far stayed relatively clear of\ncentral Union politics. Mr Collins\nhas been spotted discussing the\nmatter in the RSCU office recently.\nThe Court has been asked to decide if the decision to remove John\nCollins as Returning Officer was\nconstitutional. The appeal centres\non four points; insufficient time to\nconsider the issue, conflicts of interest by members of Exec, relevant evidence unavailable, and procedural irregularities (otherwise\nknown as poor quality hackery).\nMr Collins apparently convened\nthe meeting himself, which lasted\nfor more than three hours, casting\ndoubts on the first point. It is true\nthat Exec members faced conflicts\nNo results by Felix\u2019s deadline day, Union Court called in to deal with a dispute between the President and\nthe Executive Committee, and candidates\u2019 expressing dissatisfaction with the process \u2013 Felix explains all\nAndy Sykes\nEditor-in-chief\nof interest, having seconded or\notherwise supported one or more\ncandidate in the sabbatical and/or\nNUS elections. However, even if\nmore members of Exec had been\npresent, almost all would have\nfaced this conflict.\nWhy call the Court?\nIf the Court decides it was not constitutional for Exec to remove Mr\nCollins as Returning Officer, then\nthis does not remove any claim of\nbias against Mr Collins; rather, it\nforces Exec to meet to discuss the\ncomplaint again, and decide if the\nallegations of bias are valid.\nWhy John Collins has not appealed directly to Council, the supreme body of the Union, remains\nunknown. A new Exec may well\nmake the same decision.\nSo what does this all mean?\nElection results will be delayed. For\nhow long, no-one knows. Before\nresults can be announced, all the\ncandidates must sign a declaration\nwhich says that the election is free\nand fair. So far, very few sabbatical\ncandidates have signed it.\nCandidates approached by Felix\nwho had not signed the declaration said that they either had outstanding complaints that had not\nbeen resolved (such as a Felix Editor candidate who has seen someone systematically removing their\nposters) or that they felt it was\nnot appropriate while the status\nof the Returning Officer was still\nundetermined.\nA complete farce\nIt appears the candidates are somewhat disillusioned by the process as\nwell. Felix has approached each of\nthe candidates for comment. \u201cThis\nsorry debacle has had no effect on\nthe outcome whatsoever and even\nif he [Collins] feels wronged he\nshould just stop whinging and take\none for the team to preserve the integrity of what were, on the whole,\nhassle free elections,\u201d said one\ncandidate, who wished to remain\nanonymous. Another candidate\nfound the elections to be somewhat\nless than satisfactory: \u201cThe whole\nthing was a complete fucking shambles,\u201d adding that he had signed the\ndeclaration but he regretted doing\nso. One candidate referred to the\nelection as \u201cthe most farcical I\u2019ve\nseen in my time at Imperial.\u201d Most\ncandidates have expressed unhappiness with the hustings, one calling it \u201ca complete and unmitigated\nfarce\u201d. Some candidates expressed\ndissatisfaction with Mr Collins\u2019 role\nas Returning Officer, one citing his\napparent inability to keep his anger\nin check, though recognising that\nbeing RO is a difficult task.\nThe future\nThough all this farcical to-ing and\nfro-ing will probably have little effect on the election results, it has\ndone little to improve the Union\u2019s\npublic face.\nA pram.

The\nmen\u2019s/mixed race was won by\nSt Mary\u2019s University College in\na time of 98 minutes 54 seconds.\nNottingham University finished\nas runners up whilst 14AC (Not-tingham University Old Boys)\ntook third place.\nThe foreign competition was\nwon by the Dutch University\nSquad, whilst first guest team\nwas 14AC.

The runner up\nspot was taken by St Mary\u2019s University College, whilst Sheffield Hallam\nUniversity claimed third place. The\nDutch University Squad and 14AC\nboth completed a double by winning the women\u2019s foreign and guest\nteam competition respectively. The\ninternal women\u2019s competition was\nwon by CivEng Revenge in a time\nof 56 minutes and 39 seconds. The\nnext internal team was Beit Hall\n(62 minutes 37 seconds) and the\nthird best internal team was Girls\nAbound Improved\n(62 minutes 46 sec-onds). The fastest\ninternal individuals were Harriet\nScott (11 minutes\n38 seconds), Hilary Dyer (13\nminutes 15\nseconds)\nand Sara\nAl-Kahmidi (13 minutes 22\nseconds).\nHowever, the most\nimportant prizes were\nthe wooden spoons\n(and lots of alcohol)!\nInthemen\u2019s/mixed\nthese were given\nto Beit Hall\nS3 Warriors,\nwhilst in the\nwomen\u2019s race,\nthe prize was\n(rather surprisingly)\ngiven to Ecole Central Paris.\nAfter the prize giving ceremony\nthe committee swiftly cleaned up\nthe JCR, whilst the competitors\nwent back home (or to the gym/\nEthos) to make themselves look\nbeautiful. It took a while for me to\nget there, but when the race organiser finally got to dB\u2019s (at about\n10:00) the party was well and truly\npumping! There was an estimated\ncrowd of about 600 people; it was so\nbusy that even some of the sabbs\nwere seen working behind the bar!\nBut there was still another famous\ncontest to be completed \u2013 the Boat\nRace. There were many teams\nlined up side by side (too many for\nme to remember), but the boat race\nwas swiftly won by Manchester\nUniversity, whilst Imperial beat the\nImperial Old Boys to claim those\never so vital bragging rights! The\nparty was, once again, a fantastic\nnight and it definitely lived up to its\nreputation of being one of the most\npopular and successful nights for\nthe union.\nI would like to thank everyone\nwho competed in the event for turning up and making the day such a\nmemorable one in the college\u2019s\ncentenary year. The HPR committee would also like to thank Imperial College, ICU, College Catering,\nSecurity, St Johns Ambulance, The\nRoyal Parks, the timekeepers and\nresults team, and all the marshals.\nThere is also a special mention for\nKristine Rajamanikam whose advice and experience was particularly helpful at the times of need and to\nAziz Bilgrami who helped with taking in entry forms.

    "content": "Live music up the wazoo\nTake two live reviews, one of up-and-comers and another of noise, mix thoroughly\nGod bless the shared iTunes libraries on the Imperial network, without which I would not have discovered The Freedom Spark, Larrikin\nLove\u2019s debut album. After having\nlistened to it on repeat to the point\nwhere all lyrics were firmly embedded into my memory, I was ecstatic\nwhen Felix offered me to chance to\ngo and review them.\nUsually a dedicated dance music\nfan when out and about, I have appreciated indie and its \u2018sub-genres\u2019\nfrom afar for a long time, so this gig,\nbeing my first and also my first visit\nto Koko, added to the excitement.\nIt is very easy to lump a lot of the\nbands that circle the charts into the\ncategory of indie without looking at\nwhat the band has to offer. Larrikin\nLove combines elements of many\ngenres including folk music, guitar\nsolos reminiscent of Santana, vocals not dissimilar from the Kooks\nand the strong Irish influence is\nclear too.\nUpon entering Koko I warmed to\nit straight away. It had theatre-like\nquality in that it is set on many lev-els, where seating would have been,\nwith the addition of the boxes overlooking the stage too. The feel to\nthe venue was not the beer soaked,\ncigarette butt-lined floor as I had\nimagined of gigs, but had a more\nsophisticated air that matched the\ndrinks prices too! The night started\nwith me enjoying the most expensive double vodka and cranberry of\nmy life (\u00a37.50) and then sticking to\ncider for the rest, much more fitting for the occasion anyway!\nThe stage itself was littered with\nvarious paraphernalia including\na plastic sharks head, a few potted plants and several inflatable\ngoats. Rather reflective of Larrikin\nLove\u2019s varied music style and also\nof the band members\u2019 colourful\npersonalities.\nThe Tiny Dancers were first on\nthe line up and after having been\nrecommended to me by the Larrikin Love I was keen to see what\nthey were all about. Fronted by a\nsinger reminding me slightly of\nAxl Rose, but slightly cooler in my\nopinion, he sported a fine face of\nglitter and entertained a non-danc-ing crowd with \u2018folk rock\u2019 jazzed\nup with an eclectic mix of violins\nas well as hints of Arabian tones.\nI thoroughly enjoyed their set although many in the crowd thought\notherwise: I winced for the Tiny\nDancers as I heard boos and cries\nof \u201cYour shit!\u201d coming from the\nback and only hoped the laws of\nphysics combined with the throngs\nof people there stopped the shouts\nfrom being heard by the band.\nAfter a twenty minute interlude,\nwhere we were spoilt (ahem) with\nthe delights of Top 40 rock, the\nimpatience for Larrikin Love to\ncome on stage was palpable and\nthe moment the lights went up a\nstampede of fans rushed from the\nbar areas to wherever they could\nbest see Edward (donning a top\nhat), Miko (I want his \u201cI know Tom\nFrog\u201d T-shirt!), Alfie and Coz. Us\ngirls stayed on the second level\naway from the beer-fueled dancing and beer-fueled beer-throwing\nwhich ensued in front of the stage.\nThe show kicked off with the much\nloved Happy as Annie followed\nclosely by my personal favourite\nEdwoud (the track that drew my\nattention to Larrikin Love). Many\ntracks were played from the album\nas well as some I was not familiar\nwith. As Downing Street Kindling\nmarked the end of the show I related very much to Edward\u2019s sentiments \u201cEngland has nothing more\nto offer me\u201d and felt saddened at\nthe prospects of leaving and returning back to reality. However,\nthe band and the Tiny Dancers surprised us all with piling back onto\nthe stage for an encore, kitted out\nin silver space suits and partaking\nin some post-show drunken stomping on stage amidst the cheering\nand clapping.\nWhile indulging in some Larrikin\nLove memorabilia we\u2019ve got to congratulate David Kay, aka Axl Rose,\nminus face glitter and ensure him\nthat the bands set was enjoyed.\nI left feeling this was the first of\nmany gigs I would be attending and\nonly look forward to seeing the Tiny\nDancers and Larrikin Love again\nin the future.\nCaz Knight\nMatty Hoban\nis looking at you\nY\noyo how\u2019s my little mu-sicarinos? What\u2019s up in\nthe hizzle? Where you\nat dawg? You got the\nwhole city behind you.\nSince with all this Centenary\nfever, there will be a resurrection\nof of Femm hopefully, since it died\nfrom starvation at the beginning of\nthis term. Well, I needed to study\nand realised that it took up a bit of\nmy life to put together that thing. I\nshall however produce a 100 year\ntheme, yet to be decided on and\nFemm will be big. Yes, hopefully it\nwill be done soon, maybe not this\nterm, maybe it will, the suspense!\nAlong with all this Centenary\ncraziness I thought that I should\ntalk about what is happening mu-sic-wise. Well, let us first look towards the Jazz and Rock society.\nJazz and Rock are dedicated to\nproviding an affordable practice\nspace and they are the life-blood\nof live music at the College. Like\nso many societies, they are only\nas good as their members\u2019 activity so I suggest you join them and\nreap the benefits of being part of\nan active live music society. You\ncan pick up experience in being\na soundman or find (good) musicians to make some sweet love-food with.\nThe Jazz and Rock society\nare organising two events in the\ntheme of the Centenary: the first\nis the Medics vs. Non-medics\nRock-off which is basically battle\nod the bands varsity stylee; the\nother event is called The Clash of\nthe Century which will be a huge\nbattle of the bands competition.\nI recommend that you enter the\nlatter if you are a band, and if you\nare not, just go. Go to www.jazzan-drock.co.uk for more information.\nThe Medics vs. Non-medics night\nis on 6th March and the Clash of\nthe Century is on the 10th March.\nThe events are both in dB\u2019s. You\nshould go.\nThere will be more musical\nevents and on 17th March, there\nwill be a Kids Will Be Skeletons\nwhich will help celebrate the 10th\nanniversary of Gringo Records,\na brilliant Nottingham-based\nrecord label. The headliners will\nbe Souvaris, who appeared at the\nunion last year and astounded us\nall. Following them is Bilge Pump\nwho are a Leeds-based noise-rock\nband who make stonking great\nmusic, and the drummer is one\nof the best UK drummers around\nat the minute. So get involved and\nmaybe organise your own events.\nLarrikin Love\nKoko\nlive review\nFour bands. Half a stage. A pool\ntournament. Noise! Noise! Noise!\nSmashing into your ears like Richard Hammond's brain (look, he's alright now!); the sound is a perpendicular obtuse triangle pulverised\ninto a square hole. Oh for the love\nof noise.\nIt\u2019s four bands, and four is a lovely\nnumber, but to honest, only half of\nthis noise-pie was worth watch-ing; Geisha. And Yolk. Bristol and\nFrance, united, c'est la revolution!\nGeisha \u2013 once described as\n\u2018crushing blasts of impossibly hy-perdistorted rock baked in massive\nfrequency overload and massive\nhooks and melodies and sinister\ncrushing riffs, all of it slathered in\nfilthy throbbing feedback and white\nnoise horror holocaust\u2019 \u2013 load up\nthe stage with what appears to be a\nwall of amps.\nThe ever-decreasing space shifts\nTony and Steve onto the floor and\ninto the crowd, bringing the per-Yolk/Geisha\nThe Plaza\nlive review\nformer audience relationship a little more sweaty closer. The concept\nof Geisha has changed remarkably\nduring their 5 year existence. After\nchanging drummers from human\nto sub-human to robot (aka Terry\nBOTzio, drum machine extrodi-naire), they have progressed from\nthe classic 'shout like Alec Empire\nand add distortion' to their current blood curdling anger sadness\nI feel love mash up. The setlist is an\norgy of new songs, with names like\nVon Dreck und Feuer, Fulcivision,\nExploitation Cinema in the Workplace and Bloodbath in Bethlehem\n(exclusively renamed at this gig).\nYou'd think you were in the company of the great eccentrics, sat\nsmoking cigars listening to Wagner.\nBut oh no, it\u2019s two beardy men bashing out distortion in a fury of anger.\nThe precision of the drum machine\nbeats and syncopation add a new\ndimension to the beautifully miscellany sound of guitar and bass.\nThe crowd are actually staring\nin amazement as the music grows\nand dies from synth and bass lined\nmelodies to an ambience of fuzz and\nbrutal guitar abuse. It\u2019s music with\nsexual frustration, like Berlioz on\nspeed, watching some girl wearing\npink shoes. If you want a pretty picture think of Dinasaur Jr colliding\nwith My Bloody Valentine and Slint,\nripping out the vocal chords of Unsane and Helmet. And may I add,\nthe bassist is a piece of hot ass!\nAfter the onslaught of Geisha's\nlast song, a version of I Feel Love\nthat made me want to tear my heart\nout and pretend love exists as a\nbloody heap of aorta and ventricles,\nYolk gather themselves on stage.\nWhat can I say about Yolk? They\nare French. This explains a lot! I've\nnever cast my eyes on such a genius group of muscicians. Never in\nmy small short life.\nFrom only the first few minutes\nI think of Mr Bungle immediately,\nBungle with a vagina. The girl is\nmaking those science fiction sounds\nfrom the twilight zone, but she's using her mouth.\nThere\u2019s a violin, there\u2019s a sax-amaphone, and the drummer may\nactually have the soul of THE Terry\nJohn Bozzio. The clanking great\nbig syncopated chords, train track\nbeats and that good old gypsy folk\nmelody blend almost too well with\nDelphine Delegorgue's bursts of\nsound effects. I mean, this girl is\nproducing the imitation of blowing chunks, then sobbing ghosts. It\nprogged me in all the right ways.\nThe night is one big noise tastic\nsuccess, so much so that the usual\npub goers, who were in the middle\nof watching football and having a\npool tournament managed not to\nwave their hairy fists at the bands\nor resort to name calling in the vicinity of 'freaks' and such like.\nPerhaps the music touched their\nlittle coal-shaped hearts? Or maybe\nit proves my theory that at the centre of us all is a small troll that is\njust waiting to mosh out.\nLia Han\nLIA HAN\nGeisha bringin da noise (top), Larrikin Love bringing \u2018it\u2019 (bottom)\neviews\nMUSIC music.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n11\nfelix\nFriday 2 March 2007\nR\n\n"

    "content": "WarCraft : Defence of the Ancients\nThe girl next to you plays it. Your lecturer plays it. Chooi Yew Vern plays it, and here\u2019s how to play it\nD\nefense of the Ancients\n(DotA) depicts the epic\nbattle between the\nnoble Sentinel and the\nnefarious Scourge as\nthey attempt to destroy each other\non the field of battle. Spells fly and\nblades flash as heroes both good\nand evil fight for the supremacy of\ntheir respective allegiances. Exaggerated comments aside, DotA is a\nteam game between two sides \u2013 the\nSentinel and the Scourge. Up to five\nplayers can play on a team, meaning 10 players maximum in a game.\nUsing a range of heroes unique to\nthe side they are playing on, players do battle in order to destroy\ntheir opponent\u2019s base and ultimately their opponent\u2019s \u201cAncient\u201d while\ndefending their own \u201cAncient\u201d,\nhence the name.\nDotA sports an immense amount\nof heroes, currently numbered at\n84. Each hero has 4 unique skills\nto use throughout the game. These\nabilities determine the role a hero\nis most likely to play in a game. Heroes with skills that allow them to\nsustain more damage from enemy\nattacks usually play the \u201cTank\u201d role\nwhile those that are weak in combat\nbut cast powerful spells are usually\nthe supporting casters for the team.\nThis not only requires players to be\nskilled at the game but requires\nteams to have strong teamwork,\nto be able to forge strategies and\ntactics on the fly, as well as adapt\nto changing situations in the game.\nHeroes in DotA even have the privilege of having their own histories\nwhich adds depth to the game, not\nto mention being fun to read.\nThe items in the game, such as\npotions and weapons, are vital to\nplayers to enhance their heroes.\nItems have their own uses such\nas for healing, adding to a hero\u2019s\ndamage and casting spells such\nas cyclones and lightning bolts. A\ncombination of these basic items\ncan then be mixed together to form\nbetter items with enhanced abili-ties. A large total number of item\ncombinations combined with a\nlarge number of heroes to choose\nfrom promises to make each game\nunique and interesting.\nWhat really makes the game interesting is the fact that it is always\nevolving. New heroes, items and geographical changes are constantly\nadded to make the game interesting\nfor beginners and exciting to those\nthat are already fans of the game.\nWith DotA being the most popular\ncustom map on the Blizzard online\nBattle.net server and fast becoming a competitive game internation-ally, tinkering of heroes and items\nare constantly underway in order\nto make the game more balanced.\nWith the game constantly changing and improving, players have to\nregularly rethink their game strategies and hero builds in order to best\ntheir opponents.\nSo how do you start playing DotA?\nFirst, get yourself a copy of Warcraft\n3 and its expansion, The Frozen\nThrone. Download the map and the\nAI information from www.getdota.\ncom. With this you\u2019re set to play!\nYou should refrain from jumping\nstraight into an actual game online\nor with friends as you\u2019ll probably\nnot do too well on your first try (this\nis speaking from personal experi-ence). Play a few practice games\nby yourself or with the computer\non the AI map, just to get familiar with the game. Practice with a\nfew heroes to start and move on to\nother heroes once you get the hang\nof them. Once you\u2019re confident with\nyour skill, its time to move on to the\nactual thing.\nYou can log on to Battle.net \u2013 Blizzard\u2019s internet matchmaking service \u2013 to play DotA online or get together a few friends and play over\nthe Local Area Network. A word of\nadvice: playing with the computer\nis nothing compared to playing with\nreal players. However, if you intend\nto get better at the game, nothing\nbeats real experience. Guides and\ntips are available online for players\nwho seek to improve their game and\ntake it to the next level. For more\ninformation and announcements\non the game, visit the DotA main\nwebsite at www.dota-allstars.com\nor come join ICGC\u2019s sessions.\nThe key things to remember in\nDotA tend to be common across all\ngames \u2013 first, it\u2019s important to know\nhow you play. Once you\u2019ve found\nsome heroes that you enjoy playing\nwith, stick to them and get better at\nplaying them. It\u2019s all very well being\nan all-rounder, but you need sharp\nskills in some areas to get by.\nYou also need to get to know DotA\u2019s large repertoire of skills and\nitems. If you don\u2019t know that your\nopponent can stun your hero, then\nhe won\u2019t be the only one stunned\nwhen you come to pull off your final\npush.Know what you\u2019re up against,\nor get beaten.\nSpeed is also of the essence, so\nlook for items (and heroes) that can\nhelp with movement. A slow hero\nis a dead one, so don\u2019t get caught\nnapping.\nFinally, remember that your hero\nlives and dies based on the experience he can gain \u2013 and that means\nkilling blows. Taking the final hit on\nan enemy not only nabs you more\nexperience, but denies enemies\nthe experiences themselves. Watch\nhealth levels of the units around\nyou and focus attacks carefully.\nDefence of the Ancients is one of\nthe Computer Games Society\u2019s\nnetworked games. If you want\nto get involved in some matches,\nemail nb604@imperial.ac.uk to\nsubscribe to the CGC Mailing List.\nMajestic. Shiny. Prone to posing for dramatic pictures. It\u2019s like the Felix centrefold, but with more clothes and less controversy afterwards\n18 felix Friday 2 March 2007\nGAMES games.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n\n"

Clearly,\nthere are plenty of\npeople who (quite rightly) might\nquestion whether being good at\ngames is such a good thing after\nall. But the best way to play is to\nplay to win.\nThis week is about winning.\nSome of it\u2019s about working\ntogether to win \u2013 if you can call\nour death-addled trip through\nthe ranks of SWAT a \u201cwin\u201d, that\nis. Some of it\u2019s about setting\noff on a course to be the best\n\u2013 alright, Warcraft III mods\ndon\u2019t polish up into personal\ndevelopment movies as well as\nboxers or superheroes do, but\nyou get the idea.\nIt\u2019s quite hard for designers\nto play around with the idea of\nwinning. Recently, one of the\ndevelopers of Empire Earth\npublished an article on the\nidea of forcing a player to lose\nin certain situations. Even\nthough it was the worst crime\na developer could commit, he\nsaid, it could prove to be one of\nthe most powerful design tools\nwhen used properly.\nHideo Kojima \u2013 the plot-crazed madman behind the\nMetal Gear Solid series \u2013\nfrequently talks about his desire\nto create a game that \u201clocks\u201d\nafter you die \u2013 effectively\ngranting you one life, one go\nat the game before it renders\nitself unplayable. Winning\nthen becomes something very\ndifferent indeed.\nGamers can be split into those\nwho play multiplayer and those\nwho don\u2019t. The single-players\nare trained to fight against a\ncomputer and win, so they tend\nto look for quick patterns and\nways to solve problems using\nearlier ideas. But the ones\nthat play online are forced to\nkeep changing and thinking in\ndifferent ways.\nMaybe everyone does need\na good kick up the arse from\ndesigners? Single-player games\nneed the concept of winning\nto be redefined to stop games\ngetting repetitive \u2013 narrative-driven games tend to be better\nat shaping this idea of \u201cvictory\u201d.\nMultiplayer gamers, on the\nother hand, are getting too\ncomplacent with the idea of\ngaming. Counterstrike cuts\ndown the die-and-respawn\nsentiment, but until someone\nhas the balls to take Kojima\u2019s\nidea onto shop shelves, it\u2019s not\nquite the same.\ngames.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nMichael Cook\nGames Editor\n16 felix Friday 2 March 2007\nGAMES games.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nThis week in videogaming\nFollowing last week\u2019s coverage\nof the sghOpen tournament 2007\ncomes an announcement of ICGC\u2019s\nfirst cash gaming tournament\n(playing for cash, not with it), which\nwill run in mid-March and promise\na variety of prizes from \u00a350 to \u00a3200.\nThere are four games to compete\nin \u2013 Warcraft III, Counterstrike 1.6,\nPro Evolution 6, and DotA. Signups for Warcraft and Pro Evolution\nclose on March 2nd (the day of our\nrelease, so hurry!) and signups for\nCS1.6 and DotA close on the 9th \u2013\nwww.imperialcgc.com for more in-formation, but don\u2019t forget to check\nout our article on DotA this week if\nyou want to find out more about the\ngame.\nFinance is a funny thing in the\nreal world. This week we\u2019ve had\nnews of forthcoming price drops in\nall of the next-gen consoles, partly\ndue to lower production costs \u2013\nSony is outsourcing Cell production\nrather than trying to co-ordinate it\nin-house \u2013 but mainly due to a race\nto compete financially as the early\nstages come to a close.\nBut this week also provided reports that consumers are likely\nto get stung in the next twelve\nmonths with continuing high prices\nfor much online content. Sony has\nboasted about free online access\nto the Playstation3\u2019s main hub, but\nprices for other services remains\nhigh, and the Nintendo Virtual Console prices seem entirely frozen.\nScreen Digest published a report\nthis week stating that a \u201csmall portion\u201d of next-gen games were likely\nto be profitable, but most would lose\nmoney due to spiralling production\ncosts and overinvestment. But this\ndoes lead us to ask \u2013 with hardware\nmanufacturers, software develop-ers, and consumers all losing out\nfinancially over the next four years\n\u2013 who exactly is making money?\nStrange though it sounds, it could\nwell be retailers. Already famous\nfor taking a large cut of the final\nsale price, it was thought a few\nyears ago that the high street would\ndie off as internet shopping drained\nrevenues, but American store EB/\nGameStop has gone from strength\nto strength since the new wave of\nWant to kill people for money?

If high\nstreet retailing is going to survive,\nit might be the only reasonable way\nto do it. Of course, reasonable might\nbe the last thing you\u2019d call it.\nReleases on this side of the Atlantic aren\u2019t so hot this week, but\nif you\u2019re a PC gamer there are a\nfew notable good \u2018uns this week\n\u2013 depending on your opinion of a\nSims 2 add-on that adds Seasons to\nthe game, of course. FEAR is also\nre-released for less than a tenner,\njust in time for the average gamer\nto have a PC capable of playing it,\nand Resident Evil 4 makes an ap-pearance. The best releases of the\nmonth are still yet to come, however \u2013 the Winter slump is over, and\nthe games are returning quickly to\nthe shelves again.\nFinally, if you\u2019ve got a bit of spare\ncash, make an investment here:\nhttp://www.halflife.com\n43\nPosition of the original World of\nWarcraft in Amazon.com\u2019s hourly\ntop sellers list.\nPosition of the recently-released\nMMO Vanguard in Amazon.com\u2019s\nhourly top sellers list.\nVanguard\u2019s famous Tumbleweed instance at peak population\n<100\n\n"

So that we are all singing from the\nsame hymn sheet we thought it would be a good idea to print some of the more popular (and\nconfusing) chants. This first song is something of an anthem for Imperial rugby, traditionally\nsung when the team win and to lift spirits when things go bad:\nThis Wednesday will see the annual\ncompetition between IC and ICSM,\nalso known as the \u201cmedics\u201d, to do\nbattle once more on the sports field.\nVarsity in Imperial\u2019s centenary year\nshould be a bigger and more fiercely fought event than ever before\nThe day includes outdoor sports\nat Harlington Sports Ground including football, rugby, lacrosse\nand hockey, indoor sports at Ethos\nincluding water polo, badminton,\nnetball, basketball and squash; finishing the day with the spectacular\nICU RFC and ICSM RFC clash in\nthe JPR Williams Rugby Varsity\nMatch at Richmond Athletic Association Ground.\nEvents kick off (or push back)\nfrom 12.00 at Harlington with Imperial and Imperial Medics teams\nbattling it out in football, rugby, lacrosse and hockey matches.\nLast year there was some fierce\ncompetition between the 2nd and\n3rd XV, in the rugby, with the medics\nwinning both games but not without\na fight from the Imperial boys. The\nfootball club showed their flair by\ncomprehensively beating the medics at Harlington, in some cases utterly embarrassing the medics and\nleaving the supporters wondering\nwhether; rather than face IC themselves they had each brought along\ntheir favourite great aunt to play\ninstead.\nThe hockey club did not disappoint either, with all the mens and\nwomens hockey teams dominating\nthe field, providing great entertainment for the supporters who were\nthere.\nAt Ethos, the water polo, badmin-ton, basketball and netball sides are\nback for some more competition\nand this year, squash has also been\nadded to the program, however\ndue to the lack of viewing areas in\nEthos, we will not be selling tickets\nto the Ethos matches.\nThe JPR Williams Cup is now in\nits fifth year, last year the medics\nedged away towards the end of the\ngame, winning 22 \u2013 12; 2007 promises stronger competition from IC,\nexcellent rugby, and a very vocal\nand enthusiastic crowd.

The tune if the same as the Candy Man song from the start of the first Charlie and\nthe Chocolate Factory film, the good thing about this chant is that some rather large, slightly\nlairy, drunken bloke will start and all you have to do is repeat what he says:\nWho can take just two bricks, hold one in each hand,\nbang them on a medic, like the cymbals in the band?\nThe S&M Man, The S&M Man,\n\u2018cause he mixes it with love\nand makes the hurt feel good...\nThe hurt feel good...\nWho can take a feminist, punch her in the face.\nThrow the bitch in the kitchen and yell, \u201cKnow your fucking place!\u201d\nWho can go to an abortion clinic, sneak around the back,\nRummage through the dumpster and grab a tasty snack?\nWho can go to an abortion clinic, fuck sneaking round the back,\nEnter through the front door and take one off the rack?\nWho can take two ice picks, shove \u2018em in her ears,\nride her like a Harley while he fucks her in the rear?\nThere are also some ever-popular one-liners including:\nShipman is your idol, Shipman is your idol, la la la la, la la la la\nMedics take it up the arse, do-dah, do-dah!\nWho owns you, who owns you\nAnd my housemate\u2019s personal favourite:\n(No I don\u2019t live with very nice (or intelligent) people, if you have a spare room please email:\nfelix.sport@imperial.ac.uk)\nIf all else fails then just copy what the person next to you is yelling, or simply yell something\nincoherent involving medics and some unsightly part of your anatomy!

The new VPA, whoever they\nmay be, should have excellent organisational skills, an appreciation\nof the traditions of the RCSU and be\ntall, dark and handsome.\nWelfare Officer\nIf you care about the students of the\nRCSU and want to be the official\nstudent condom dispenser then you\nshould apply for the Welfare Officer\nposition! You need to be available to\ntalk to students: I strongly recommend being available for weekly\nsurgeries. You will represent the\nstudents views in committees like\nthe Representation and Welfare\nBoard. At the start of the year you\nwill settle-in the freshers by coordinating the buddy scheme.\nSports Officer\nThe role of the sports officer is to facilitate sports within the RCSU. In\nother words the sports officer must\nbe able to tempt people away from\nthe union bar and into sport. The\nsports officer comes into contact\nwith large amounts of the student\npopulation so the ability to deal\nwith people is a must, as is time\nmanagement. As for other skills,\nreliability, organisation and persistence are fundamental.\nAcademic Affairs Officer\nThe Academic Affairs Officer may\nnot sound the most glamorous of\njobs, but it\u2019s one of the most important positions in the RCSU. You\nwill be responsible for ensuring\nthat the four thousand undergraduates have the facilities they need\nin order to study effectively and\nefficiently. This is your chance to\nmake changes which will improve\nthe manner in which courses are\nrun. In reality this means you\u2019ll sit\nin on many meetings (mostly with\nfree lunches), most at a high level\n(including Union Council), and try\nand sway decisions your way.\nEvents Officer\nEvents Officer is a job for people\nwho are organised, fun and socia-ble, including organising a range\nof events for Fresher\u2019s week and\nthroughout the year, like bar nights,\npub crawls, club nights, buddies\nevents, RAG events... Well the list\nis endless and it\u2019s basically up to\nyou to provide organised fun events\nthat appeal to a very diverse union.\nThis job is for people with an imagination and an ability to get people\ntogether. Good Luck and enjoy!\nPublicity and Web Comm.\nThe publicity officers are responsible for publicising and promoting the many RCSU events during\nthe year. What\u2019s involved? Well,\nposter design, sticking up posters,\nupdating the website with the latest announcements, sports results,\nevents info, making design changes\nif needed, and generally organising\npublicity pushes. After a big publicity push it is very satisfying being\npart of a very successful event.\nBroadsheet Editor\nBroadsheet is a glossy magazine\nof 12 to 24 pages of news from the\nfaculty, produced twice per term.\nThe editor\u2019s job is to collect the ma-terial, construct the issue, and get\nit printed. The editor also puts together the RCSU Freshers\u2019 Handbook over the summer.\nDepartmental Representative\n(by the current Physics Rep)\nPhysics Departmental Representative is responsible for all the important things: proper elections and\nrepresentation from Year Reps,\nPhysics Staff Student committee,\nUCAS tours, some fresher\u2019s events,\nthe buddy scheme. Oh and definitely one of the perks is getting to sit on\nthe Physics safety committee and\nhear about the accidents that happened in the physics department.\nOther positions available are:\nHonorary Junior Treasurer, Masters Rep and Postgrad Research\nRep.\nNot into science? CGCU nominations are open\nE\nngineers unite! Now is\nthe time to follow in the\nfootsteps of your forefathers and stand for election in the CGCU committee elections. Are you the next\nJames Fok, Nick Simpson, Tristan\nSherliker or Ashley Brown?\nHere\u2019s what the current holders\nof some positions had to say about\nwhat they\u2019ve been doing this year.\nPresident\nAs President, I planned events for\nfresher\u2019s week withthe rest of\nThat\u2019s some big boots to fill\nthe Committee number, culminating in the Fresher\u2019s Ball. We have\nalso organised a mince pie party,\npaintballing trip, bar nights \u2013 the\nlist goes on. On a serious note,\nrunning the union is not just about\nfun and keeping the students away\nfrom their books You also represent them academically and must\nensure that their welfare is looked\nafter. There are dedicated officers\nfor each of the above.\nVice President (Finance and Socs)\nMy role as the Vice President of Finance and Societies is to take care\nof the pot of money we have each\nyear and ensure we all get the most\nout of it.\nI also help out with any problems societies might have, and\nassist anyone who might want\nto set up a new one.\nVice President (Activities)\nAs Vice President (Activities)\nit is my privilege and responsibility to organise the various\nsocial events we put on for the\nstudents.\nI\u2019ve been involved in the Buddy\nSchemes, the Lord Mayor\u2019s Show\nand the Internship Centre; but also\nin organising bar nights in the Union, paintballing, football, a sports\nday, the infamous egg race and\nmany more.\nHonorary Secretary\nAs the incoming Honorary Secretary I will spend the following year\ndocumenting everything CGCU\ndoes. Unfortunately for me we\nhave a long agenda of activities and\nevents!\nI also have the responsibility of\narranging your Fresher\u2019s Dinner.\nEvery year the Fresher\u2019s Dinner grows and if you take on this\nrole you\u2019ll be responsible for making sure it is even better than this\nyear\u2019s.\nAcademic Affairs Officer\nAcademic representation plays a\nkey role in ensuring that the academics and facilities are adapted to\nthe needs of the students, and are\nbefitting of an institution such as\nImperial College.\nI ensure that the dep reps (see\nbelow) do their job and that the academic representation is organised\nand \u201cup-to-scratch\u201d. I also work\nwith ICU and IC faculty at a higher\nlevel to ensure that the courses are\ntailored to the needs of taught students (undergrad & MSc students).\nDepartmental Representative\nThe way the academic representation structure for the Engineering\nFaculty works is that each department has a departmental representative commonly known as a\nDep Rep. They are elected to handle all academic and welfare matters in the department, to ensure\nthat these are taken seriously by\nthe staff and that they are resolved\neither at a departmental level or\ntaken to CGCU.\nHe refused to fight the RCSU president.

Playing against the wind\nforced them to run more of their\npossession. With some excellent extended periods of play, and fast ball\nsecured by everywhere flankers\nSimon Jones and Rhys Cutler. The\nball was spread wide incorporating fullback Will and wing Tom on a\nnumber of occasions, but the CSM\nput up a determined defence. A\npenalty awarded to RSM was within striking distance, which \u2018missed\u2019\nby inches as the Camborne touch\njudge decided.\nThe RSM scrum was even more\nsecure with the arrival of Jovan,\nand any Camborne possession was\nquickly turned over with Gareths\nsneaky hands. RSM continued\ntheir pressure with great running\nlines from man of the match Flannan and Jovan, but could not convert it into points. RSM again were\nawarded a penalty for foul play in\nthe Camborne defensive line in\nthe last minute of the game. Stewy\nstruck it well, under immense pres-sure, only to have the wind drag it\nwide at the last second leaving CSM\nto claim their first Bottle Match in\na decade.\nA devastated RSM proceeded to\nthe union to drown theirs sorrows,\nand plan their Bottle recovery mission to Camborne next year.\nRob Phillips\nThe match started fairly cautiously\nwith both teams not giving anything\naway too early. The favourable wind\nblowing behind the RSM was taken\nadvantage of, with captain and fly-half Rob Phillipps kicking them into\na good attacking position. In the\nopposition 22, the RSM tried to run\nsome backs crash back moves with\ncentres Andy D and Nathan but\nwere spoiled by an eager Camborne\ndefence. RSM continued to win safe\nfast line out ball with a combination\nof pin-point throwing from Charlie\nand catching from Ben, which Camborne could only defend against il-legally, providing scrum-half Stewy\nto step up and take the points. RSM\n3-0 Camborne.\nCamborne came straight back\nwith re-newed enthusiasm with a\nseries of rolling mauls which the\nRSM had some trouble stopping.\nHowever, the RSM forwards defence at the fringes was solid. The\nprops Alex BB and Joe held strong\nin the scrums even after claims of\neye gauging and ear biting had been\nstubbornly ignored by the ref. Camborne finally tried to spread the ball\nwide where their winger was soon\ndenied access by Alex O\u2019Rourke.\nThe referees dubious decision of a\nspear tackle led to Alex spending 10\nminutes in the sin bin.\nThe weakened RSM team was\nspread even more allowing the\nCSM to push hard for a try.

We had established\nthat over the summer, we ought to\nhave secured sponsorship for the\nevent \u2013 a stumbling block for most\norganisers \u2013 but met with success\nby this one. By the start of term a\nrace permit had been obtained,\nand by December formal invites to\nteams from across Britain and Europe had been sent. The preparations for Imperial College\u2019s largest\nstudent sporting event were well\nunderway! (Yes, that\u2019s right: the\nHyde Park Relays is bigger than\nthe Varsity matches!)\nThe massive task for the\norganising committee was\nto promote the event within\nImperial College. Although\nmost students and staff know\nabout the relays, it was still very\ncritical to ensure that freshers\nknew about the race. Over\nChristmas, there were whispers across campus of the\nHPR, but we needed to get\na full-blown message out\nASAP! A number of different methods were tried,\nincluding practicing\nthe race route, advertising on Facebook, setting\nup stalls\nacross\ncampus\nand even\nplacing a\nbanner in\nthe JCR.

In\nthe run up to deadline day, I\u2019m sure\nyou couldn\u2019t walk around campus\nwithout seeing a HPR poster.\nPreparations for the committee\nreally kicked off when our foreign\nfriends arrived. 45 Poles overran\nthe campus on the Wednesday before the race, with 17 Germans and\n88 Dutch arriving the following day!\nThis was when the hard work really started for the committee.

    "content": "An open challenge to the sceptics\nI\nn the many discussions I have\nhad on Islam, there seems\nto be an underlying concept\nwith those out of \u201cthe fold\u201d \u2013\nthat a belief in Islam is inherently irrational and ultimately due\nto the unexplainable, fervent zeal of\npast-dead generations. Further, it is\neven more baffling that this belief is\nmaking a resurgence. More Muslims are practising than ever before,\nand more people are still becoming\nMuslim. A mere few years ago I\nwas just another semi/non-prac-tising Muslim, bored with strange,\nalien and ultimately \u201cweird\u201d beliefs\nin the face of the Enlightenment\u2019s\nglory. Today I am more observant\nand at ease with the liberation of\nIslam than ever before.\nThe crux of the issue is this; how\ndo we know that a self-professed\nprophet is truly from God? It is simple \u2013 we challenge him on a miracle.\nThe following is Islam\u2019s miracle:\n\u201cAnd if you (mankind) are in\ndoubt concerning that which We\nhave sent down [the Qur\u2019an] to Our\nslave Muhammad (peace be upon\nhim) then produce a chapter of the\nlike thereof and call your witnesses\n[supporters and helpers] besides\nAllah, if you are truthful\u201d\n(Author: God, The Qur\u2019an, chapter 2, verse 23)\nIf Muhammed was just a man, another politician grabbing at power\nExaming the Qu\u2019ran in a critical, literary fashion \u2013 does it prove itself to be \u201cinimitable\u201d? Does the\nconstruction of the Arabic text reveal the presence of a divine hand?\nwith a (more than usual?) masterful\nplan, then surely his genius can be\nmatched with the collective effort of\nhumanity? What I want to show you\nis why Muslims regard the Qur\u2019an\nas a piece of literary excellence,\nsomething that is totally inimitable\nby man, and thus miraculous. It is a\nproof that you may wish to disagree\nwith, but it is rational, and so the\nbelief is based upon reason. It is not\narbitrary or inherited.\nFirst of all, what is Arabic poetry?\nArabic poetry is a form of metrical\nspeech with a rhyme. This rhyme is\nachieved by every line of the poem\nending upon a specific letter. The\nmetrical aspect comes in when you\ncan divide the Arabic up into different divisions (called in Arabic \u2018al-bihar\u2019 or \u2018the seas\u2019) according to the\npattern of short or long syllables\nused in the line (with some variance allowed). This was codified\nin the 8th Century by al-Khalili bin\nAhmed and there are 16 distinct,\nseparate seas. If there is a verse of\npoetry not in these 16 seas, then it\nis either prose, or it is not Arabic.\nThere is no other way to construct\nthe Arabic languge.\nFrom a purely objective and structural view, the Qur\u2019an does not fall\ninto any of the categories above, be\nthey prose or rhymed. Some chapters contain some elements of the\nabove rhyming seas, yet the style\nmay switch quickly and smoothly to\nprose. Thus, when a chapter is evaluated as a whole, it is not possible\nto ascertain its literary form. The\nQur\u2019an therefore defines its own\nliterary genre, with its own unique\nform that has surpassed attempts\nby any other to come close to imitating it. Such a peculiarity does not\narise when evaluating any other literary work on the planet.\nYou may think that God would\nhave spent too much time to make\nthe message aesthetically pleasing\nto have actually left any wisdom in\nit. Yet the Qur\u2019an brings a huge relief and wisdom to the struggles of\nlife when applied in a sincere and\nproper (not perverted) manner. All\nthis from an illiterate forty year old\nman with no history of being a liar.\nNo person, orientalist or eastern,\nhas challenged that fact that prior\nto the Qur\u2019an, Mohammed was\nmore inclined to asceticism and\nabandoning the world, rather than\npersuading anyone about anything.\nBoth western and eastern scholars recognized the evident inimi-tability of the Qur\u2019an. The Scottish\nOrientalist Hamilton Gibb said that\n\u201cwith remarkable boldness and self\nconfidence Muhammad appealed\nas a supreme confirmation of his\nmission to the Qur\u2019an itself. Like\nall Arabs they were connoisseurs\nof language and rhetoric. Well, then\nif the Qur\u2019an were his own composition other men could rival it. Let\nthem produce ten verses like it. If\nthey could not, and it is obvious that\nthey could not, then let them accept\nOmar Hashmi\nthe Qur\u2019an as an outstanding evi-dential miracle\u201d\n(Islam: A Historical Survey. Oxford University Press, p. 28)\nHistorically too, we can see that\nthe challenge has never been met.\nThose who knew classical Arabic\nthe best were the Arabs of Mohammed\u2019s time. Their attempts\nat immitating the Qur\u2019an are well\ndocumented. Examples such as\nMusaylimah the liar and al-Muqaffa\u2019 are just two of many people who\nwanted Islam to be neutralised.\nThere have been no acceptable imi-tations, and how can we expect to\ndo any better now with less knowledge of the language comparred to\nback then (though I\u2019m sure more\npeople want to try).\nSo, if you want to try to copy it,\nthen please do so! The shortest\nchapter in the Qur\u2019an is three lines,\nso just try and copy three lines. It\ncant be haram (forbidden), because\nDear Sir,\nLike many other students, I am one\nof the select staunch supporters of\nthe \u2018fry-up\u2019 breakfast since its glory\ndays as the \u2018All Day Breakfast\u2019 in\nthe JCR. My diet of two fried eggs,\nfour hash browns and baked beans\nsaw me through many a lecture,\nwell fed, satisfied and ready to face\nany challenges ahead\nHaving seen various re-branding\nstrategies imposed upon this most\nlegendary of college feasts, I have\nwitnessed drastic changes, such as\nrestricting breakfast serving times\ntill 10:30am (not a civilised time by\nthis student\u2019s calculations), and\nthe move of venue from the JCR,\nvia the MDH, to the SCR. This last\nmove, instigated since the start of\nisn\u2019t Allah asking you to do it? So\nplease do try, and whatever you\ncome up with I will diligently forward to every scholar/academy I\ncan find. If they can\u2019t reply to you,\nthen I will push them to accept that\nthe book can be forged. However,\nwe have been holding our breath\nagainst intellectuals and linguists\nfor 1400 years, and I don\u2019t anticipate\nthat it will stop.\nI can promise you that far from\nthe Muslim community being outraged at the audacity of the chal-lenge, they will respect those who\nare sincere enough to search for\nhigher Truths.\nEvery time there is propaganda\nagainst Islam, its simply increases\nthe Muslim motivation for dialogue.\nGo on, wake the sleeping giant.\nPlease see www.theinimita-blequran.com for more detailed\nliterature.\nthe new term, has been particularly\ninfuriating: we are expected to enter a fantastic room used by college\nstaff, postgraduates, visitors and\nprospective students, purchase\nour breakfast and swiftly remove\nourselves to the JCR where we unkempt and dishevelled undergraduates can gnaw at black pudding to\nour heart\u2019s content. We are but\ncommon students, why should the\nserving staff in the SCR be nice to\nus?\nNot all the enforced changes have\nbeen bad. For instance, the decision to play Heart FM\u2019s \u201880s and\n\u201890s cheese throughout breakfast\ntime in the MDH was greeted with\nenthusiasm, but sadly cannot be\ncontinued upstairs in the SCR. The\nloyalty card scheme, which promises a free breakfast for every 9 purchased within 2 calendar months,\nwas long overdue and has proved\nextremely popular.\nHowever, it would appear that\namongst all these positive changes,\nwe are being overcharged for our\ndaily breakfast.\nSigns in the SCR clearly state\nfood item prices, for a normal visitor and for a student. As under-graduates, we receive 10% discount\nand VAT exemption; whilst staff\nand postgraduates are denied this\nlatter luxury. It appears that the\ncomputer system used at SCR tills\nneglects to award the full discount\navailable to us for whatever reason\n(maybe they assumed when they\nbuilt the system that no undergraduates would ever use the SCR\nand if they did, well tough, they can\npay what everyone else pays since\nthey\u2019re not supposed to be there\nanyway).\nTake for example a recent breakfast I purchased at the SCR. I purchased 8 items (breakdown available on request) which totalled \u00a32.35\naccording to the marked prices, but\nwas charged \u00a32.69 after my card\nwas swiped through the card reader at the till. Whilst the difference is\na matter of pennies, it is nearly 15%\nmore than what I should have been\npaying which is a matter of considerable concern. It defeats the purpose of the loyalty card, since by\ncharging students 15% more each\ntime, catering can recoup the cost\nof the 10th breakfast and still make\na profit.\nIinviteFelixtotryaSCRbreakfast\nsometime, and discover the pleasures of a good wholesome meal\nwith plenty of variety, but be forewarned that his wallet may empty\nsomewhat faster than expected!\nYours truly,\nUnhappy in JCR\nPS: whatever happened to the water coolers in JCR? Do they expect\nus to buy all our drinking water\nfrom the shop, whilst our richer\nlecturers next door benefit from\nchilled distilled water straight\nfrom t\u2019Valley?\nAndy Sykes replies:\nWe\u2019ve passed it on to the right folks.\nToo much technology spoilt the breakfast budget\nomment&\nOpinion\n5\nfelix\nFriday 2 March 2007\nC\nThe Qu\u2019ran: written more than 600 years ago, and still not bettered?\n\n"

It\nhas been this way since the sunny\nlittle seaside town was transformed\ninto the production line of the most\nfamous movies in the world early\nlast century, and how better to celebrate ego than with a little gold\nman. This man went on to become\naffectionately known, as you may\nhave guessed, as Oscar.\nIn case you\u2019d missed it, this week\nsaw the 79th Academy Awards, the\nmost prestigious awards ceremony\nin the film calendar, and you\u2019d be\nhard-pressed to find a bigger ceremony in any field given the sway\nthe movie industry, especially that\nof Hollywood, holds today. If you\nwant artistic recognition, look to\nCannes, but for glam, glitz, and\ngold, head here. Win an Oscar and\nyou can have it on your tombstone.\nThat will be your legacy.\nOr so is the common perception.\nWhilst it may shatter an illusion or\ntwo to say it, the Oscars are notorious for getting it wrong as well.\nMissing out key players in film history seems to be the major gaff:\nHitchcock and Kubrick both died\nwithout being Best Director, a lifetime achievement award being the\nformer\u2019s only consolation and a\nminor Special Effects prize for the\nlatter; The Shawshank Redemption and Pulp Fiction were both\nbeaten to Best Picture by Forrest\nGump; and whoever nominated\nSylvester Stallone for Best Actor in\n\u201976 alongside Robert De Niro must\nbe licking their wounds to this day.\nYes, there are years when the Academy just can\u2019t get it right. And this\nyear wasn\u2019t about the talent. Unless\nyour name is Mirren or Whittaker\nthat is.\nDon\u2019t get me wrong; the nominations weren\u2019t bad. The problems\nare that (a) the best of the selection\nwere never going to win, and (b)\nthe best of the year were criminally\noverlooked. Besides Whitaker, The\nLast King of Scotland went unnoticed despite winning my vote for\nfilm of the year, filled with as many\nlaughs as brutal shocks (and not\nlike Scary Movie), closely followed\nby United 93 which is conspicuous in its absence from the awards\nseason. Too soon America? Maybe.\nXenophobia, commonly a major\nproblem in the Oscars with great\nforeign offerings being limited to a\nsingle Best Foreign Film category,\nwas reported to be AWOL this year\nso I\u2019m not sure what to blame for\nVolver not making it into the foreign\ncategory even. Shame on you Academy. Worst of all, whilst last year\u2019s\nshortlist for Best Picture contained\nthree great films (Crash, Capote,\nGood Night and Good Luck), one\ngood film (Munich) and the dull and\nhorrendously overrated exploigay-tion fest of Brokeback Mountain,\nthis year it seemed mediocrity was\nthe order of the day, at least in the\nsame category. The acting reminds\nus that these people do know what\nthey\u2019re talking about. It\u2019s just the\npremiership awards that show a\nfavour for an old friend takes prec-edence, even when the world is\nwatching.\nBest Picture \u2013 The Departed\nThis didn\u2019t win because it was the\nBest Picture. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve met\nanyone who was supporting it. It\nwon because Scorsese won. The\nrule goes that Academy members\nget bored by the end of the voting\nsheet and so tick the same boxes in\ndirector and picture categories, exceptions to which have only arisen\nfive times in the past twenty years.\nOne of these times was last year\nand so it would have been too much\nof a break with tradition to award\nScorsese then cheat him out of Best\nPicture and give it to the deserved\nwinner, Little Miss Sunshine. This\nfilm wasn\u2019t groundbreaking but\nneither were the others, and at\nleast this one was enjoyable from\nstart to finish. I would have happily\nseen The Queen walk away with it\non the wave of Mirren fever as well\nbecause it was so different to how\nI\u2019d imagined it. Babel was also surprised me: I imagined something\nworth the entrance fee and was\nrewarded with sleep-inducing pap\nthat must have only won the major prize at the Globes because of\nthe cultural diversity it showcased.\nI\u2019m glad it didn\u2019t win here. Last up\nwas Letters from Iwo Jima but I\u2019d\naward Babel before I gave another\naward to Oscar whore Clint Eastwood who has less integrity than\nJade Goody.\nBest Director \u2013 Martin Scorsese\nScorsese had everything going for\nhim: The Golden Globe, the Directors Guild Award, five failed nominations already and a much better\nback catalogue than this mediocre\ngangster fable. That\u2019s why he won:\nsentimentality and the \u201coops-weforgot-you-earlier\u201d syndrome. This\ntime they remembered before he\nwas dead so at least his comic questioning of the envelope contents\nwas better than a posthumous acceptance by wife/child/whoever.\nStand by for ovations, applause and\nrewriting the \u201cBiggest Snubs in History\u201d books. But always remember\nthat Paul Greengrass should have\nwon for United 93.\nBest Actor \u2013 Forest Whitaker\nThis is where the smiles start.\nForget that he\u2019s not the lead ac-tor, forget that James McAvoy has\nbeen cruelly left off every shortlist\nand just accept this was the right\nresult, no matter how many sympathy votes Peter O\u2019 Toole got for being a pervy old man playing a pervy\nold man in Venus. Forest Whitaker\ntore the screen to shreds with his\nvicious scenes in The Last King\nof Scotland and made being best\nfriends with a Ugandan dictator\nlook like a great way to spend a gap\nyear. Why did they overlook the film\nin every other category though? I\nwon\u2019t rant any longer; if you saw it,\nI\u2019m sure you agree. Don\u2019t feel too\nsorry for the others: DiCaprio will\nwin one day, Will Smith makes very\ndubious film choices so isn\u2019t ready\nfor this yet and as for Ryan Gosling,\ndid anyone see Half Nelson?\nBest Actress \u2013 The Queen, sorry,\nHelen Mirren\nWhile the Chinese New Year tried\nheralding the year of the pig, everyone else saw it was really the year\nof Mirren. Every critics\u2019 circle in\nthe world gave her those gold stars\nshe loved (other than the Evening\nStandard who sided with Dame\nJudi, I\u2019m sure Helen hasn\u2019t lost\ntoo much sleep though) and well-deserved it was too. If the Royal\nFamily ever gets democratically\nelected then Mirren will have my\nvote for that too. The weird thing is\nthat this was a surprisingly strong\ncategory given the clear-cut odds\noffered: Penelope Cruz (Volver)\nproved she should stick to Spain\nrather than wallowing in Hollywood\ndrivel, Dame Judi Dench (Notes on\na Scandal) showed that rancorous\nlesbian was just another inspired\nday at the office, Kate Winslet (Lit-tle Children) completed the British triptych in what I imagine was\ngreat acting from our finest un-der-forty actress and Meryl Streep\n(The Devil Wears Prada) just nails\neverything she goes into, even if\nthis was hardly the dramatic power\nshe\u2019s flaunted in the likes of Sophie\u2019s Choice. Still, no-one\u2019s stealing Mirren\u2019s light here, the true\nQueen of the night.\nBest Supporting Players \u2013 Alan\nArkin and Jennifer Hudson\nGood to see an upset to make the\ndull ceremony slightly more inter-esting, and better it be Eddie Murphy (Dreamgirls) who was pushed\nto the side than the leading part\nfavourites. My money was on Mark\nWahlberg who managed to steal the\nonly acting nomination in The Departed next to Nicholson, DiCaprio, Matt Damon, Alec Baldwin and\nMartin Sheen. Alan Arkin for Little\nMiss Sunshine was a pleasant, if\nforgettable, surprise though as I\u2019m\nnot a Murphy fan. The other two,\nDjimon Hounsou (Blood Diamond)\nand Jackie Earle Haley (Little Children), passed me by completely.\nDreamgirls did come into its own\nwith Jennifer Hudson. It was her\nfilm, not Beyonce\u2019s, and so this\naward was fair, if a bit too Cinderella for my liking. First acting job ever\nfor the girl who used to be a Burger\nKing salesperson and before January was most famous for losing in\nAmerican Idol? Hmm, I doubt she\u2019ll\nhave another shot any time soon,\nunlike some of the other contend-ers. Abigail Breslin (Little Miss\nSunshine, yes the little girl) has\nher whole life to act and I think this\nnomination was youth sentimentality unseen at the Oscars since\nthey awarded Anna Paquin at age\n11. Now she\u2019s in X-Men in case you\nthought she\u2019d rise and rise\u2026 Cate\nBlanchett has one already and the\nBabel actresses will see their dues\nwhen they are in better films. Hudson won\u2019t be holding court over the\ncategory for years to come.\nO\nther than that, it was\ngood to see Al Gore\ntaking home the\ndocumentary prize\nfor global warming\nflick An Inconvenient Truth, days\nbefore critics attacked his excessive energy use at home. I would\nhave liked to see the two screenplay awards go the The Queen and\nNotes on a Scandal but I doubt\nthe largely North American crowd\nin the Kodak Theatre appreciated\nthe delicacy of the British touch as\nmuch as I did. And Mexican cinema\ngot the boost it deserved, despite\nBabel boring the world, as Pan\u2019s\nLabyrinth picked up a hat trick of\ntechnical doodahs, wahey.\nSoitwasn\u2019tatotalbustonthenight\nto be fair, but the winners shouldn\u2019t\nbe the ones that enter the Hall of\nFame. When the time is right, The\nLast King of Scotland will get consigned to the \u201cgreat forgotten\u201d pile\nwith Citizen Kane, Vertigo and The\nShining. Well maybe not, but it\u2019ll\njoin a personal inventory of exhibits in the case against the Academy.\nDon\u2019t get me started on everything\nfrom Europe and beyond, they won\u2019t\nunderstand anyway.\nThat\u2019s not what the Academy is\nfor. It\u2019s an ivory tower in its own\nworld, swelling with a sense of su-periority. But this year, even they\nmust have been slightly bored by\nthe show they put on. If they could\neven see past the ego sitting in\nfront.\nScorsese attempts to hide his insecurity over the size of his statuette\nCruz works the carpet while Hudson copies Mirren\u2019s dress and pose in the hope people will remember her\n12 felix Friday 2 March 2007\nFILM film.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nAlex Casey\nFilm Editor\n\n"

We were forced to display the picture by numbers X, 6 and 7 otherwise the\nconsequence was a severe case of bum cracks meet face juxtaposed with gaseous emission. We wish for forgiveness in our time of clear need\nThe 16-man squad were full of high\nspirits and energy as they left the\nRSM looking the most professional\nthey have ever been. Only time\nwould tell if this highly charismatic\nband of brothers would pull off a\nstunt that hasn\u2019t been seen for 7\nyears.\nAfter watching the CSM ladies\nsteal a victory off our own, our resolve was hardened and we held\nour heads high as we took to the\nfield. The first half we played at a\nnail biting pace which was matched\nby the CSM.\nOur steely defence of Pete, Simon,\nSam and Tim were hard to beat\nand our midfield could be renamed\nwholefield as they were seen in\nhelping out in the entirety of the\npitch. There were some stunning\nruns through midfield with Sam L,\nYung and Rich F at left and right\nhalves passing triangles round the\nCornish folk with the centre halves,\nRich D and Mikey.\nUnfortunately we did not capital-ise on our opportunities and Camborne snuck two fluky deflections\npast Ade, who was playing up to his\nname \u2018The Cat\u2019. Leon and Kwesi\nfound themselves fighting a devilish battle with the CSM defence\nonly to be unlucky not to score.\nThe half time whistle went and\nRSM were 2-0 down, a harsh score\nline considering how even the\nmatch had been so far. The RSM\nhave come back from worse situations before and they were going\nto do their best to come back from\nthis one. As soon as the second half\nstarted the aggression from us doubled and we made many more attacks into their half. Leon, Ben and\nTom did sterling work at bringing\nthe game to Camborne. The attacking play only cut us short through\ntheir added fitness allowing them to\nbreak, and score.\nAnthony and John gave fresh legs\nto the defence, but not enough to\nkeep back the CSM defence. Our\ndefence shorts were perfect not letting anything go in with Ade once\nagain proving himself and gained\nchampagne moment for a reaction\nsave of a drag flick. The defence\nkept making powerful on-the-line\nsaves displaying the resolve of the\nteam.\nOur consolation goal was made\nby Pike when he carefully lofted\nthe ball for the Camborne defender\nto guide in, beautiful tactics well\nworked. The game ended 1-5, Camborne having out-played us. Special\nmention to Tom for brilliant stick\nwork and play on the ball, Man of\nthe Match went to Pete for stoic\ndefending.\nThe score line was a poor reflection of the game, and how hard we\nhad worked or how well we played.\nThank you to all who played and to\nKiran for some first class heckling\nand support.\nLadies rugby team also gets kicked into touch\nLadies Rugby\nRSM 1st XV 5\nCSM 1st XV 15\nFor the second time, RSM gathered together a group of dedicated,\nvaliant ladies ready to fight to the\ndeath for the \u201cParky Bottle\u201d (a\nnow formalised trophy rather than\na scrawled on milk bottle that was\nused last year) against the inbred\nscum that formed the CSM \u201cwomen\u201d. Unfortunately \u201ccough-tests\u201d\nwere not permitted on the CSM\nteam, so we could only take their\nword for it that they were in fact,\nwomen- a fact I\u2019m still unconvinced\nof.\nThe game began and CSM were\nfirst to score resulting in a height-Susie Ogilvie\nening in the game\u2019s intensity.\nTechnicallyplaying\u201ctouch\u201drugby,\ntackles became harder and head-on\ncollisions were rife, preventing any\nextra yards being gained by either\nparty. Ellie Bailey spotted an opening on the try line and dived forward\nduring a restart, causing great delight on our part to wipe the smug\ngrins off their mutated faces.\nUnfortunately, they only retaliated harder and scored two more\ntries, resulting in a 15-5 defeat for\nus. A sad result after the hard work\nand effort put in, but all the more\nmotivation to win it next year! We\u2019re\ncoming for you CSM!\nLuckily pride was restored later\nin the evening when all the RSM\nand CSM team captains fought it\nout in a boat race. RSM\u2019s experienced warriors wiped the floor with\nthe useless CSM scum. Not that\nthey ever stood a chance!\nGet on the deck and give me ten for losing! Then give me twenty for looking so damn happy about losing!\nFelix Sport needs you!\nYes, you! Well, your sports reports at\nleast. Along with any more pictures of\nAlice Rowlands naked that you might\nhave laying around. Dirty stalker.\nsport.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n\n"

One goes\nalong the top floor to the main ga-rage, above the walkway. The other goes with me, down the stairs,\ncleans out the car-park and wedges\nthe doors. They wait outside the\nmain garage for the final assault.\nIn that respect, the Endurance\nrun of SWAT 4 went identically,\nalbeit with me in a lower-ranking\nposition, and everyone having far\nstranger accents than the butch\nAmericans that accompanied the\nAI\u2019s chirps of, \u201cGet down or I put\nyou down!\u201d\nThe difference really came when\nit was time for me and my partner\nto break through the door to the office and take out the perp standing\ndirectly across the room from us. It\nwas simple \u2013 blow the door, shout\nat the disoriented criminal, and\nthen tazer him. It was simple. No\nAI pathfinding problems. No misunderstood commands. Just five\nhumans and Voice-Over-IP com-munications. Simple.\nMy partner blows the C2 charge\non the door, and it flies open, showing that the target has moved since\nwe used our camera-sticks to check\nunder the door. He turns around\ncalmly and has a quite real pistol with quite real bullets in it. My\ntazer \u2013 which looks like a sellotape\ndispenser \u2013 fires off prematurely\n(always embarassing when you\u2019re\nin a situation like that) and thuds\ninto the wooden doorframe, buzzing loudly as it defies everything I\nlearnt in Year 9 physics.\nFortunately, the door-breaching\nStarsky to my Hutch has got his\nprimary weapon out \u2013 a pepper ball\ngun, still a peashooter compared to\nthe Colt Python being waved at us\n\u2013 and has let off several rounds into\nthe perp\u2019s face. He\u2019s screaming. It\u2019s\na good sign.\nStarsky bumbles over to handcuff\nthe wailing, eye-rubbing chump,\nand I move slowly into the office\nroom, looking out of the window\nthat looks down into the garage.\nThe other half of our team is waiting on that side.\nThere\u2019s a shout to the left, and I\nturn to see another perp on the elevated walkway, behind the glass.\nMy primary weapon is out, another\npepperball gun. No chances this\ntime. Pff! Pff! Pff!\nThe pepperballs explode on the\nglass like hailstones on a barbeque,\nleaving a cloud of green smog in\nthe office, and doing very little to\nthe paper-thin sheet of glass. The\nmagnum rounds the perp is firing,\nit turns out, are far better at penetrating glass. As well as fibreglass.\nAnd skull.\nSo began the seven-hour jog\nthrough the most recent outing of\nthe tactical criminal-punching simulator SWAT 4. It was expected to\nbe the shortest Endurance run to\ndate, since each mission only took\naround fifteen minutes to complete,\nand the two teams of five were expected to get extremely high end-of-mission ratings straight off the\nmark. After the 51% report for the\nAuto Parts mission, things began to\nchange.\nIt was the diamond merchant\u2019s\nhostage rescue where things really\nbegan to go downhill. After three\nattempts at the mission, all ending\nin either the execution of a hostage\nor \u2013 more amusingly \u2013 the complete\ngutting of the team by a single shot-gun-wielding attacker, our team\u2019s\nleader began to change his tactics.\nWe all started with our usual load-out \u2013 CS Gas, heavy armour, non-lethal weapons. But someone had\nan AK-47.\nWhoops.\nAfter a few restarts, mostly involving either tazering the rogue SWAT\nmember into submission, or everyone getting slaughtered, terrorist\nstereotype-style, we managed to\ngroup together and progress past\nthe mission \u2013 not without half of the\nteam getting shot first, but it was\ncompleted either way.\nIt turned out that missions were\nnotdestinedtobefive-minutejaunts\nafter all, and an estimated two-hour\nfinish time rapidly increased as\nplans gave way to shooting which\ngave way to gas grenade fights. By\nthe time we\u2019d started playing the\nmissions properly again, we\u2019d had\nto merge the two teams together\ndue to dropouts, and found ourselves hopelessly stuck just a few\nmissions from the end.\nSingle-player runs such as Deus\nEx, or more recently, Hitman: Blood\nMoney, were just a matter of plodding through a long enough story at\nyour own pace. Hitman picked up a\ncompetitive element once the players got talking to each other, but\nSWAT 4 was a different challenge.\nAll you needed to do to complete\nthe game was to keep the players\nfocused, and keep concentrating on\nplans. But with the team at varying\nlevels of inebriation, and problems\nwith the way the server was set up,\nit was easier said than done.\nThe final, beautiful moment came\nin the last mission when, after half\nan hour of frustrating cock-ups and\nself-imposed civilian executions,\nthe team decided to shirk their soft-ly-softly approach, ditch the bean-bag-firing shotguns, and take some\nreal weapons. A SWAT 4 element,\nall with Magnums, storming a controversial research laboratory, with\nself-given orders to shoot first and\ntake no prisoners later.\nLike a crazy black ops team from\nsome awful faux-action TV series,\nthe Englishman, the Irishman,\nthe Scotsman and the Northerner\nstumbled through the eerie spotlights and explosive gas canisters,\nheadshotting and door-kicking like\nit was Counterstrike on steroids.\nAfter an evening of cock-ups and\nsubtlety, it was a beautiful end.\nSingle-player might have depth,\nbut it doesn\u2019t have heavily-armed\nYorkshiremen.\nRadio Chatter\nEDDIE \u2013 Pick it.\nANDREW \u2013 Someone else pick it,\nI\u2019ve got the gas out.\nMIKE \u2013 I\u2019ll pick it.\n(Mike begins to pick the lock.)\nANDREW \u2013 Is there a way to put\na grenade away after you\u2019ve got\nready to throw it?\nEDDIE \u2013 RightMIKE \u2013 \u2026 you mean after you\u2019ve\ntaken the pin out?\nANDREW \u2013 Yeah.\nMIKE \u2013 \u2026\nEDDIE \u2013 Alright, look, I\u2019ll secure\nthe right hand of the room.

Alright? Alright. Now we\u2019ve\ngot a door open at the end of that\ncorridor \u2026 Go wedge the door.\nMIKE \u2013 Alright, I\u2019ve got a wedge.\nEDDIE \u2013 No, it\u2019s alright.

Well a\nweek has passed and so has the\nBottle Match, the following few\npages give a sneak insight into the\ncarnage that was last weekend.\nThe Bottle Match kicked off in\ntrue style with a traditional RSM\nBar night, as usual the yard glass\nmade its appearance and the beer\ntourettes took us to Belushi\u2019s. Friday morning started with the golf,\nand amazingly the sore heads from\nthe night before didn\u2019t stop the\nteam making a 9am tee off time!\nThe squash matches took place in\nthe evening at Wilson House, followed by the obligatory celebrations in the Union.\nOn Saturday we made our way to\nHarlington where hockey (men\u2019s\nand women\u2019s), football (men\u2019s) and\nrugby (men\u2019s and women\u2019s) were\nplayed. As ever there was much\nbanter coming from the sidelines\nthroughout the day, especially during the rugby match. One of my\nfavourite quotes has to be from Satan, \u201cIs inbred the right term or am\nI being politically incorrect?\u201d As\nwell as the absurd amount of abuse\nbeing thrown at the Camborne min-ers, a team of enthusiastic RSMers\ndazzled the inbreds with a half time\nperformance of bouncing baps and\nballs (they streaked!). Using this\nas a distraction, Ents Officer Holly\nSutherland broke through the CSM\ndefences to snatch some of their\nmuch treasured regalia. 30 seconds\nlater, Holly was on the floor amidst\na brawl of fists and studs (and not in\na good way!). The end of the match\nsaw many tears shed, of which we\nshall say no more (other than what\nis written on the opposite page\n\u2013 Ed).\nFollowing the matches we migrated home towards the Union Bar for\na swift 6 halves before our slap up\nmeal in the SCR. A quick retreat\nsaw us back in the Union Bar and\nDa\u2019Vincis for the presentation and\nfurther carnage. After the handover\nof OUR bottle, we challenged CSM\nwith the final sporting event, the\nCaptain\u2019s Boat Race. We retained\nour pride and absolutely destroyed\nthem, when will they ever learn?\nWe look forward to next year when\nthe Bottle will return!\nDaniel Hill\nRSM Sports Officer\nMourning miners lose their bottle\nAlice Rowlands,\nSports Editor\nPHOTOGRAPHS BY CHRIS LARVIN\n\n"

    "content": "March is always a weird period for myself and the\nblonde as it is one of those months that just creep\nuponyouwhenyouleastexpectit.Onethoughtthat\nshe has on the month is that it follows February, the\ntime for love, romance and RAG. A hub of activity\nsurrounds the students at the College as most plan\ntheir event in the shortest month of the year. Now\nthis confuses me, (as well as the misses, but this\nwas to be expected as she is non-Imperial) why\nwould the top students in the country, if not the\nworld plan events; a) in February and b) all at the\nsame time? There must be something magical or\nmysterious about the month! The same hypnotic\ntype drug that gets people to spend hundreds on\ntheir loved ones for a day invented by Clinton cards\nis infecting our students and getting us to pile a\nwhole host of events together.\nWhen speaking to some of the students who lie on\nthe sofas outside my o\ufb03ce, they had a few ideas\non why February was so unique. A few suggestions\nwere \u201cit\u02bcs hard to spell the month\u201d, (she was a non\nmedic) another student was more philosophical and\ntried to use some historical fact to his argument\u2026\n\u201cFebruary is probably named after a Greek God and\nthat God must have been pretty crap or something\nand so they decided it should be the shortest\nmonth of the year\u201d. Both are very sound arguments\nto my question but taking the \ufb01rst student\u02bcs idea on\nnames being a factor when deeming the importance\nof a month\u2026why not May? Surely, it is the most\nextreme of the twelve? For starters it does not even\nend with \u201cary\u201d, it possesses the least letters of them\nall and it\u02bcs named after the Imperial God of Rock\nand hair products, Brian May!\nSo before we close the book on the wonder that is\nFebruary and present it with its month of the year\nsash, I wanted to notify the jury on a little gem called\nMarch. March to me is special as it welcomes in the\nsmell of Varsity. A period in the College\u02bcs year,\nwhere friends become enemies and lovers become\nhaters, for just a few days. For those who have been\na sleep for a few years or are new to IC, varsity is\nthe chance for the medical school to exhibit why\nwe are the cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me of Imperial. The day\nallows for the medical school clubs to compete\nagainst the rest of Imperial in a whole host of\nsports from waterpolo to lacrosse and of course\nthe big J.P.R. Williams rugby trophy in the evening.\nVarsity carries with it the underlying message that\nthe medical school is a unique entity and that it\u02bcs\nindividuality needs to be respected. It is more than\njust a sports competition. This year varsity comes\nwith a few delightful little twists, one being that it\nis Imperial\u02bcs big 100 and the Faculty of Medicine\u02bcs\n10th birthday this summer and two, that we have a\nnew competition added to the pot\u2026athletics (Which\nyou will read about in my next exciting instalment).\nSo below, is a little highlight of the fun packed day\nnext week.\n2007 welcomes another exciting Varsity\nprogramme with an array of spectator sports on\no\ufb00er. The day entails outdoor sports at Harlington\nSports Ground including football, rugby, lacrosse\nand hockey, indoor sports at Ethos including water\npolo, badminton, netball, basketball and squash;\n\ufb01nishing the day with the spectacular ICU RFC and\nICSM RFC clash in the JPR Williams Rugby Varsity\nMatch at Richmond Athletic Association Ground.\nHarlington Sports Ground\nEvents kick o\ufb00 from 12.00 at Harlington with\nImperial and Imperial Medics teams battling it out\nin football, rugby, lacrosse and hockey matches.\nTickets are required for the matches at Harlington.\nEthos\nThe water polo, badminton, basketball and\nnetball sides are back for some more competition\nthis year and squash has also been added to the\nprogramme.\nDue to the lack of viewing areas in Ethos, we will not\nbe selling tickets to the Ethos matches.\nJPR Williams Rugby Varsity Match\nThe \ufb01fth year in the event\u02bcs history, 2007 promises\neven stronger competition, excellent rugby, and\na very vocal and enthusiastic crowd.
