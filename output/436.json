    "content": "2 - FELIX, NOVEMBER26 th1976 letters to the editor\nThat Rag Committee meeting Linstead fallacies\nDear Sir, \u2014 With reference to\nthe article on Rag on the\nfront page, and the editorial\nin last week's FELIX, we, the undersigned (who all attended the meeting) wish to\nobject most strongly to the\nreporting.,\nWe feel that at no stage\ndid any C CU participate in\n\"inter and intra C CU bickering\" or \" wrangling\" to \" uphold the image of their C CU\".. Any discussion, although heated\nat times, was directed at the\nleaders of the Rag Committee\non a united C CU front. It\nseemed to us that it was being\nleft to the CC Us to organise\nthe majority of Rag Week, and\ncalling a meeting the day\nbefore it started, so that we could do this, appeared to\nbe impractical.\nAfter some sensible conversation all matters were\nresolved, and there is no\nexcuse at all for the reports\nin FELIX, which made the\nmeeting appear to be unproductive. The situation' was obviously over drama tis ed due\nto the need of a good front\npage story.\nWe feel that there is an\nobvious lack of leadership on\nthe committee, but we cannot\nin any way deride the effort\nof the Carnival Co-or d in at or, Secretary and Treasurer, since\nthey have had to pick up the\ndregs after the summer. It is with great regret that this\nletter has had to be written\nbut incompetent reporting has\ngrossly mis-informed the whole\nof Imperial College, Yours faithfully,\nPKu row ski( RSMU President)\nM Osborn\n(RSMU Vice President)\nA Musgrove\n(RSMU Ents Officer)\nC Yule( RSMU Newsletter Editor)\nS Braund\n( R CSU Vice President)\nS Dearing\n( C& GU President)\nR Beveridge\n( C& GU Publicity Officer)\nCA Morrell\n( R CSU President)\nNUS Time to get out\nDear Sir, \u2014 This letter has been written in the light of last Friday's startling announcement from the NUS Executive that they intend to\nclose down the Union's travel\nand printing service, due to\ntheir accrued deficit of over\n\u00a3500,000. I suggest that the\ntime is here for us to' again\nexamine our position within NUS. But before we join the band\nof d is safi lia ting unions led by Edinburgh, I would like to elucidate some of the\nimplications and how we could cope with them.\nIn last term's debate on whether NUS was representative of students, Charles\nClarke used his political rhetoric to the utmost. I ask you, how can a group of full time officers represent the\nviews of students, the ranks\nof whom they left many years\nago? Surely our representative\nshould be closely involved within student circles, at the\ngrass roots level, and be democratically elected. Do I hear cries of more\nbureaucracy and elections? Quite possible, but not\nnecessary as we already have\nsomeone who can fill the roll, the Union President. One of the principal factors\nthat bonds the NUS together,\nis the claim that they can present a strong bargaining\nbody when putting forward the\nstudent case to the government\nover matters such as grants\nfees and graduate un employ ment, areas in which I feel the\nNUS must be given s ome\ncredit.\nWhat is against the ICU President putting forward the\nviews of Imperial College students to the Government or\nother interested bodies?\nAt least he would have\ncredibility. If he were to feel\nisolated there is nothing to\nstop communication with other\nUnion Presidents to formulate\na unified front. Surely this\ntype of external involvement\nis what we expect from our\nPresident and if he feels this\nwould involve too much work\nthen would he not be absenting\npart of his responsibility?\nFar rather our external\npolicy is involved in matters\nwhich directly involve Imperial\nCollege students in preference\nto the spurious political and\nideological debates over\nmatters alien to us.\nAs for the services that the\nNUS offer: I can't think of any\nsector in which we as a Union would be incapable of\ndeveloping an alternative.\nWhen considering this, remember that we would have an\nextra \u00a35,000 in our coffers\nthat would otherwise have gone\nto the NU S.Ends leigh Insura n ce, which according to our\nNUS Executive is profitable,\nwould be available to you as a student, whether you be a member of the NUS or not. In\nany case it has often been\nstated that one can obtain a better insurance deal from\nmany of the large insurance\ngroups, after all insurance is a competitive market.\nNow is the time to stand\non our own, to communicate\nwith other institutions but\noverall to develop the services\nwe need and will use.\nThe decision to leave will\nbe harder to make than the one\nto stay in, but a short term\nloss would soon be forgotten\nin the light of long term gains.\nYours faithfully,\nJOHN MORGAN ICU Welfare Officer\n22 November 1976\nDear Sir, \u2014There is much more\nagreement than he supposes\nbetween Mr Cheetham's thinking \u2014 both his criticism of college residences and his praise of the knightsbridge\nAssociation plan \u2014 and the\nthinking behind the alternative\nproposed by Mr Gardiner and myself. In the latter we have\ntried to demonstrate the\neconomics and feasibility of\na human scale low rise\nsolution, which would harmon is e the interests of both students\nand residents.\nThe difficulty in making\nthe comparison Mr Cheetham\nwants to make, however, is that the Knightsbridge Association scheme accommodates\nonly 72 students and is enormously expensive. Whereas\nStephen Gardiner's plan\nattempts to meet the College's brief as far as is possible, and within the limits of the\nbenefaction. This is not easy. The scheme wins on costs, yet it already represents a compromise (280 hall places)\nbetween the College's target\n(which issued in daylighting\ninfringements and conditions\nthat I dislike as much as Mr\nCheetham does) and the lower\naccommodation targets, which\nwould give the space and privacy Mr Cheetham very\nunderstandably desires. Of course larger quadrangles\nand fewer rooms would make\nour scheme better. That is what we should have liked. Meanwhile, though, even in the scheme as it stands, Mr\nCheetham is wrong about the\nquadrangles. Their size is comparable with that of\nseveral treasured public\ngardens in the City. Let Mr\nCheetham explore the squares\nand alleys between Carter Lane and the river.\nComprehensibility. Mr Gardiner\nand I have offered to explain what schemes like his would\nbe like. The Union Executive has not responded to this offer.\nFurthermore its comments on\nthe scheme have rested on\nseveral serious misunderstand-in gs. Sports. Mr Gardiner's report,\nsent to the College, made\nsuggestions about new\nlocations for these.\nCars. There is no prospect of\nthe benefaction being available\nto accommodate cars in the\nmanner envisaged by the\nKnightsbridge Association. If\nMr Cheetham likes low rise, human scale buildings, loss of parking is the consequence.\nHe cannot have everything.\nYours sincerely,\nDAVID WIGGINS\n12 November 1976\nCritics corner(ed?)\nDear Sir, \u2014 I should like to\nexpress my extreme diss at is faction with recent issues of\nFELIX, particularly number\n434. Surely there is not such a shortage of contributions, or\nalternatively such a low standard of literacy among\nyour readers, that one page\nneeds to be occupied by a rather facile depiction of\nMorphy Day, and the centre\nspread almost wholly concealed by banner headlines advertising\nRag Week. I realise the need\nto make a visual impact on\nthe reader, but surely items\nof such doubtful relevance are\ncarrying this too far; one would expect a newspaper to\nprovide a certain amount of\nreading matter, a service\nwhich appears to have been\nneglected.\nHaving said this, I must\nwelcome the disappearance,\nin issue 434, of the opinionated\nand sometimes contradictory\ncomment appearing in the\n' What' sOn' section. Can Ian\nMorse claim that conducting a personal vendetta against\n'Sounds' (from whom the\nconcert information appears to\nbe borrowed, judging by the\nidentical printing errors) is the legitimate function of such,\na column?\nComparing the technical\nstandard, and apparent expense,\nof production of Sennet and FELIX, one would expect a similar superiority of content' in the latter. Unless material\nof more relevance and interest\nto 1C students is included, this unenviable comparison\nmay be continued; the gate of Sennet needs no further\ncomment.\nCOLIN ADAMS Mat. Sci2.12 November 1976\nIAN MORSE rep lies :-You are quite alert in your\nassumption that the gig guide\nis obtained from Sounds. As\nfor me conducting a vendetta\nagainst this poor-mans NME;\nif pointing out una c curacies of\ntruth entails the term 'vendetta'\nbeing used, then I see little\nharm in it, although two small\npieces concerning Sounds can\nhardly justify a 'vendetta'. To\nconclude, I am told some\npeople actually find the\n'What's On' column both\ninteresting and informative.\nNeed a lift give a lift\nA file of those requiring\nlifts (by car) to IC and those\nprepared to offer them is now\nbeing compiled. Details \u2014\nplease keep these to a minimum \u2014 should be place\non a plain postcard and sent to\nMISS J CRAWLEY, Department\nof Geology. A typical card\nwould read thus: (top line)\nOffered/Wanted, place of\nstarting; (underneath) name\nand internal contact point,\n(No 'phone calls and No\nLong Letters, just the essential\nfacts on a postcard.\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX, NOVEMBER26 th19765 Fake is funnier than sex\nStanding in a dark comer \u2014 appropriately enough \u2014 I was approached by\nthe Editor who, as brazen as ever,\nmanaged with little subtlety to convey\nhis wish that I review the latest erotica\nfrom SYLVIA KRIST EL. To cut a long\nstory short, I went to see it and can report thus: it is a beautifully shot film,\nas are all Franco-Italians films concerning sex. Unfortunately, but as usual, there is no story line, or even plot, as\nsuch. Miss Krist el, in her second\ncoming as Emmanuelle, moves easily from one screw to another with only a slight-pause for relief)?)\nRelief comes to her in the form of\norgasmic bliss induced by acupuncture.\nSo much then for Emmanuelle 2; sensual,\nerotic and so BORING. Equally disappointing, but not so boring, is Rene Cardona's Survive (x ABC Shaftesbury Ave and Fulham Rd, released by EMI). It is a re-creation of\nthe Andes plane crash of 1972 and the\nsubsequent ordeal of the survivors. An intense film \u2014 it starts off dramatically\nenough, with its opening sequences of\nthe crash \u2014 although it fails to bring\nhome the impact of the actions of the\nsurvivors to stay alive. Scenes of\ncan i bali sm are treated very tamely; the\ncamera zooming in only to zoom out\nagain, leaving one in doubt as to what\nhas just taken place. But it did happen;\nwhy, then, the timidity? One can only\nconclude that the director's own reticence\nthat is the root cause.\nThis is a pity because Cardona' s loose grip permeates through to the\nplayers, some of Mexico' s leading\nactors. Left to their own devices, they\nmore or less wander through film in no\nway giving it the emotional impact that\nit needs. Yet, despite all this, Survive is\nworth watching; some small part of the\nreal-life survivors does seep through.\nAnd it asks of the audience, ''Would you\nhave done this?' FOR FAKE, written, directed and\nstarring ORSON WELLES is about fake ry and the masters of that trade. Leading\nthe pack is EL MYR DE HORY, celebrated\nfor his forgeries (or shall we say, more\nkindly, exact duplicates) of post-impressionist paintings. So good, in\nfact,' that( so called) art experts have\nauthenticated them. But Welles would\nnever be content with a story so simple. He sidetracks the audience to another\nforger - de Hory's biographer, Clifford\nIrving.\nThe connections do not end here,\nhowever. Welles reveals yet another\nlink between Irving, Hughes and himself\n(and there we get the first glimpse of\nthe charlatan Welles' beginnings as an\nactor). Impunity is the forte of a great\nforger \u2014 and Welles has it, right from\nthe start. (At 16 \u2014 broke, and out of\nwork \u2014 he got his first role as an actor\nin Dublin by claiming he was a Broadway\nstar. How' s that for bare-faced cheek?)\nWith all this fake ry and imposter ing, Wei les quizzes: 'How important is an artist's signature\nto his work?' How he answers his own\nquestion is the most revealing aspect of\nhis whole attitude to subject. I leave it\nto you to find out what he says. Fake is a beautiful masterpiece, (or is\nit?) with Welles looming through, OJ A KODA R sensuously floating by, EL MYR DE HORY playing at being himself, and\nCLIFFORD IRVING desperately trying\nto maintain a facade of innocence.\nHar lech' s mob were so impressed\nwith it, they have awarded Fake the\nunique certificate M( for masterpiece).\nFake is now showing at the Essential Cinema, 76 Wardour Street, Soho (439\n3657) and the Electric Cinema, W11\nSlapstick and intimacy\nRalph Mc Tell at IC's Great Hall (last\nSaturday)\nFirst off, congratulations to Ents for\na superb Saturday evening's entertain-ment! (makes a change from last week \u2014\nEd). They had us in stitches for the first\nhour, with an original line-up called Theatre Slapstick \u2014 two girls and five\nlads with a bewildering conglomeration\nof instruments (including a gun and duck\nmating calls!) which they used well in a wide range of songs. These ranged from\nfairly serious funk rock numbers to dead\nfunny quickies. Throughout, we had sketches a' la\nMonty Python, mimicry, mime and just\ngeneral silly buggers (all well rehearsed,\ntimed slapstick). All in all Slapstick\nmade everyone have a good time; they\nshou Id go far.\nHaving being put in a good mood, we\nall waited, with baited breath, for\nRalph Mc Tell. He received a lovely\nwelcome, and got stuck in with 'You\nWere My First Song? This was the\nsecond time I 've seen this fella live, and on both occasions he's managed to\ngenerate an intimate atmosphere almost\nimmediately. There was absolute\nsilence \u2014 apart from the drunken bum\nsomeone mercifully escorted out \u2014 while\nhe sang. I felt as though he was singing\nto (and for) me alone \u2014 quite a feat in a packed Great Hall. He played many tracks off his new\nLP, including 'It's a Long Way from\nClare to Hdre' (Clare being a place in\nIreland), 'Tequila Sunset' and 'Weather\nthe Storm'. The latter in tune with the\nair conditioner.\nRalph also showed his talents on the\npiano ['Naomi' and 'Old Grey Rag' \u2014 an\nattempt at ragtime he still hasn't quite\nmastered) as well as on guitar. Throughout all the songs there was a depth of\nfrivolity.\n'Streets of London' finished the set;\nencores were 'Sweef Mystery' and yet another cockney folk song. You'ire the\nbest Mc Tell, and I think we all agreed\nthat you didn't need to wear brown\ntrousers after all. Plum\n.....with Ralph McTell\nRalph Mc Tell 'Right Side Up'Warner Brothers\nRalph Mc Tell's fourth LP for Warner\nBrothers is the second version of this\nalbum; the first of these he scrapped\nbecause, whilst technically perfect, he\nfelt it was not truely his style. The ' second' version proves to be a well-balanced combination of light-hearted, introspective songs. When I first heard it, I thought 'oh yes, just\nanother bit of background music'. But\nafter a while I found that the emotional\ncontent of the songs genuinely gets to\nyou \u2014 they're sincere, and it comes across well. Give the LP a chance, I thoroughly recommend it.\nThe eleven tracks include 'Weather\nthe Storm' (his new single), as well as\ntwo beautiful songs from a couple of his\ncontemporaries: Tom Waites' 'San Diego\nSerenade' and John Martyn's 'May YQU\nNever' (a personal favourite). His v musical ability is well exploited \u2014 with\nkeyboards on 'Naomi' and a good range\nof vocal melodies. The mellow mood is\ncarried over from the first side onto the\nsecond.\nI reckon it's an ideal record to curl\nup by the fire to, with a hot cup of coffee\nand someone nice. Plum\nWould anyone with black and white\nphotos of Rag Week please bring them\ninto the FELIX Office as soon as possible, preferably today or over the\nweekend but certainly by Monday lunch-time.\nA Princely Production\nHamlet at the Olivier, National Theatre\nAlbert Finney' s Hamlet, directed\nby Peter Hall has reached its final\nresting place in the new Olivier Theatre.\nIt is nearly twelve months since its\njourney began at the Old Vic, before\nbeing transferred temporarily to the\nstage of Lyttelton, the National Theatre's proscenium stage. At the Olivier we may\nnow see Mr Finney in all his glory, no\nlonger cramped behind the picture-frame.\nSuddenly the whole production takes on\nan air of authority which I found lacking\nbefore.\nHow exciting to see Hamlet for the\nfirst time, again! YetI felt that, in this\nHamlet, I was seeing the play anew. No longer is the Prince the drooling tow-haired youth driven to the depths of\ndespair by his inability to make up his mind; here he is dynamic, decided, but\nfrustrated by an inability to do the deed.\nMr. Finney' s performance is designed to\nextract the maximum of humour from the\nplay, from the emulation of Osric, the\naffected courtier, dropping r's all over\nthe place, to the instructions to the\nplayers, where he looks to the audience\nfor assent.\nApart from bringing the play out onto\nthe open stage, the Olivier brings the\naudience up to the actors' eye level with extraordinary results. In the ' To be\nor not to be' speech, the eyes continuously dart around the audience drawing\nthe whole house into the mind of the\nPrince. Mr Finney is supported by an excellent\ncast, Susan Fleetwood' s Ophelia and\nDenis Quil ley's Claudius in particular.\nThe length is somewhat excessive \u2014 the\nplay being split into two acts of\nabout two and a half hours and one\nhour, but the ending is well-worth\nwaiting for, as are the blue denims\nprotruding from the bottom of one cloak in Fortinbras' army.\nThomas Stevenson\n\n"

In\nparticular we drew attention to a group of activists who wanted to give\na new life to overseas student affairs.\nHere the same activists outline\ntheir plans in an open letter to all IC students.\nIC's Overseas Students Committee\n(OSC) has been very passive over the last year, probably due to loose organisation now more than ever, so we activists from overseas, together with\nsome ICU officers, have come together\nand tried to change the old form of the OSC, to a new form which we think will be more effective in dealing with our\ncommon problems. In the new form, the\nOSC will be a new major sub-committee\nof ICU Council all national societies wi II be a ff Mated to the new sub-committee.\nA new constitution has been prepared\nand will be submitted to council for\napproval. By the time this is done, a general meeting of overseas students\nwill be called to elect the executive committee, etc.\nThe new OS C will aim to:-(i) bring overseas students together,\nby organising social events (ie cultural\nevenings, to help exchange of knowledge\non how people in our countries live and\nwhat their objectives are.\nThe Links Club, conceived on\n26th October 1926 by a young American anglophile, 'RIP' Mayor, and\nthree fellow Guildsmen, 'John 'Millard,\n'Bobbie' Mayes and 'Percy' Shelley,\ncelebrated its fiftieth birthday with a special Anniversary Ball on Sat. 30th October.\nNo contemporary record of this\ninformation exists except by way of\nrecollection. The original Minute Book\nand Dinner Book missing for many years, mysteriously arrived at College on the\nThursday before the anniversary. The\nrecord of the first dinner and meeting,\nheld on Friday10 th December 1926 in the Mars Res tau rant, Soho (now de moli shed)\ncontains the following:\nThis memorable occasion of the first\nmeeting opened with musical honours,\n'Pug' being at the piano and well\nassisted by the Links Chorus\nA very enjoyable meal followed intermingled with wit and wisdom, fast and\nfurious jokes, the clank and clink of\nglasses. 'RIP' rose: \"We are gathered\ntogether for the first time as 'Friends,\nGoodfellows, Sportsmen'; for what better\nreasons could we meet? The foundation,\nthe ideals and objects of the Club are\nbound up in these words, they form the\nkeynote of our existence as a corporate\nbody: that we may ever prove true,\nloyal and cheerful, and that our acts may\nalways be those of men and sportsmen.\"\nThe meeting was adjourned at 10.30\npm when:\nSeveral Links thereupon wended their\nway into the blazing night of London town in search of entertainment a nd\namusement. Rumour hath it that they\nvisioned the dawn of day.\nLittle has changed in those fifty years.\nWell, that gives a brief explanation as to why some Guildsman can be seen\nwearing those navy, blue, maroon and pink striped ties on Thursdays. The final paragraph from those first minutes\nprobably help to explain other biz are Thursday phenomena. Each new member\nelected to the Club is given a nickname\nand a link bearing his name is added to\nthe Links Chain. The precepts of the\n(ii) organising activities related to the\nproblems facing overseas students in\nthis country, eg, discrimination in tuition\nfees, racial discrimination, restrictions\non immigration and vacation work.\nThe case of overseas students is not\nat al! limited to the arguments about the\nlevel of the tuition fees, (which has risen from \u00a380 in 1967 to \u00a3416 in 1975).\nRather, it is one specific aspect of wide\nranging links that exist between the\nthird world and the western powers.\nAfter World War 2, there was an\n'economic boom' in the western world\nand there was urgent need for labour.\nIn Britain, workers were needed as train\ndrivers, nurses, cleaners and soon. People from the West Indies, Africa, India, Pakistan came over here to do\nprecisely these jobs. But these workers\nwere never told that they were needed\nas cheap labour.\nAgain in the past, the British\nGovernment had welcomed students from\nher colonies and other under-developed\ncountries, because they were needed to\nman her colonial and neo-colonial\napparatus.\nYet, with the British economy facing\nthe worst crisis since the war, the\nimmigrant workers and overseas students\nfind themselves faced with racism and\nThe chain is\nforged\nEven the most unobservant of you\nwill have noticed that some people\nwear the same tie(s)on certain\nday(s) of each week. In the first of a series of articles FELIX looks at\nLinks Club, the Guilds' Social Club.\nClub nave been maintained to a greater\nor lesser extent since 1926 and the Club has seen many arises and survived. There seems no reason why it should not\ncontinue to do so. On 27th May 1935 the minutes record:\nAfter many good stories, we adjourned\nto the bar where we commandeered a man\nwith a banjo and sang ourselves hoarse\nuntil closing time much to the amuse men{ of a watching policeman above.\nIn 1943 the war and other more usual\nevents(!) depleted the returning members\nat the start of the '43\u2014'44 session to just three, two of whom had only been\nelected the previous term and the third\nthe term before that. The Club's constitution had not foreseen this difficulty\nand was temporarily suspended (ICU pay\nno attention!)\nIn later years, to prevent the d is banding of the Club, the constitution\nwas amended, including an article stating\nthat the dissolution of the Club could not\noccur unless consent of all the members\nand Queert Victoria was obtain eu. The future of the Club seems secure.\nOf those four founder members, ' RIP' Mayor died about five years ago, ' Percy' Shelley was last heard of in Burma in1931. The other two, ' John' Millard and\n' Bobbie' Mayes, were both able to\nattend the Anniversary Ball, together\nwith five other Links from the 1 9 2 0 ' s. Judging by the comments in the dinner\nbook passed around at the Ball, the\nevening was a splendid success.'' A memorable evening\" said 'John M',\" Never to be forgotten\", ' Bobbie'. being to id that they are no longer wanted\nin this country.\nAttempts are being made to isolate\nthe overseas students through racist\npolicies. If the overseas students are defeated, the Government will face a divided and hence weakened student\nbody. More attacks on the student body\nwiI I then follow.\nIn brief, our struggle as overseas\nstudents is one with that of the immigrant\nworkers, who are much more exploited\nand oppressed. It is also inseparable\nfrom the economic struggle of British students.\nAs long as we are compelled by\ncircumstances to come to this country,\nwe shall fight discrimination and any attempts at further exploitation.\nUNITED, FIGHT DISCRIMINATION and\nDEFEND YOUR RIGHTS. We need you all to participate for the\nbenefit of all of us. We hope to see you in our next\nmeeting which is on 30th November at1.00 pm in the (Green) Committee Room,\nRoom at the top, Union Building.( Top\nfloor).\nThe more we get united, the stronger\nwe will be.\nActivists of the OS C 'John C* wrote \" whoever invented the\ntie?\" and Sir David Nicholson ( ' Nick'),\" Long Live Links.\" Stella Sketch, wife\nof 'Wilfred' Sketch of 1927 fame comments\n\"I always thought it was the Lynx Club\" Remarks from latter vintages4 include\" Although I'm a woman, I'm one of the\nlads\" by Anne Pickard( C&G Hon Sec75 \u201476) guest of ' Blu to' Hoyle, followed\nby an anonymous \" You could have\nfooled me.\"\" It was worth the trip\nfrom Canada\" said ' Apple' Corr, and there were many comments such as\" see you in2026\",\" and2076.\" It was certainly a marvellous party,\nand in the vein of those original minutes\nRumour hath it that they visioned the\ndawn of day.\nPaul Jowitt\nWorker\ncontinued from page 3\nThe membership is six Ordinary\nMembers, elected by and from aUG M( hence the former title, ' Floor Reps.') augmented;-when meeting outside Council by the President, DP and Hon Sec.

It's a RAGing\nsuccess\nWith two events still to come, this year's Rag Week looks\nlike being declared an all-round success. Attendance at all the\nevents has been better than expected, and enthusiasm shown for\nRag has greatly impressed the Rag Week organised.\nThe 'week' started last Thursday with the Rag & Drag disco.\nOver 200 people turned up to see IF's Paula Marriott and Mines\nPornographer Stuart Arden win two well fought contests for Rag\nand Drag Queen respectively.\nThe three-legged pub crawl the following evening was even\nmore successful. Close on 300 people attempted to hobble their\nway around twelve local host ille ries. Local publicans, and their\ncustomers took the event in its intended spirit and only two pubs\nthe Harrington and the Queens Arms, barred their doors to the\n\u2022C revellers. Although more a social evening than a race, the\npub crawl was won by John Ashworth and Zinta Krumins from\nRSMU.\nThe tooting of steam engine whistles and the rattling of\ncollecting cans started the Rag Procession on Saturday morning.\nDespite fears about the level of organisation (see last week's FELIXfront page) the event passed off smoothly. The two'\nsteam engines present attracted great attention from local\nshoppers, as did the continual battle between Dave Lord's pedal car and the rest of the procession.\nThe only mishap of the day was when C& GU's 'Bo ran out\nof petrol just before re-entering College at the close of the\nprocession. The police, who had marshalled the procession, then\njoined everyone for a pint in the Union Bar.\nTo date the most well attended event was the SCAB evening\nSunday night. Over 350 people warmly applauded Dramsoc's 'After Magritte' production. In spite of complaints from SCAB Chairman Martin Kessler about the undignified stampede for the\nblue films, the event was a success.\n150 IC students would have succeeded in drinking the King\nGeorge IV pub dry on Monday night, had the pub not closed\nearly at 10.15pm. The publican was extremely annoyed at the\nrowdy songs and boisterous behaviour of the students, who he\nfelt was driving his normal custom away.\nMany people braved the cold weather Tuesday night to gather\naround the bar-b que in Beit Quad.

The week is intended\nto encourage internal support for Rag. However, the response from local\nresidents to the procession should in future be capitalised on.

    "content": "IG LEADS MOVES FOR\nNEW TRAVEL SERVICE\nICU PRESIDENT, Nick Brayshaw, and External Affairs Officer,\nHngh Barrett, have this week been-heavily involved in discussions aimed at setting up a London Student Travel Bureau to\nprovide, on a brokerage level only, similar services to those of\nthe now liquidated NUS Travel.\nAt a meeting on Wednesday\nnight leaders of some 4 0\nLondon Student unions,\nincluding ICU, were told of a plan to set up such a travel\nbureau. Trevor Phillips, LSO secretary, and author of the\nplan, envisaged a pilot scheme\nwith three retail outlets, sited\nat the University of London\nUnion, Imperial College and\nQueen Mary College, where\nformer NUS Travel offices\nexist. Mr Phillips pressed for\na3 week trial of the scheme\nto test its viability. But this was not agreed to\nat the meeting. Instead,\nstudent leaders decided to\nelect a committee to look into\nthe proposals. In the meantime\nthey will go back to their\nunions to get support for the\nidea and, possibly, financial backing. No monetary commitments were made at the meeting although the ICU Exec, who had seen Mr Phillips' plans the day before, had provisionally\nagreed to spend \u00a350 on a pilot\nscheme.\nLast night this 7 man\ncommittee, which includes\nboth Hugh Barrett and Nick Brayshaw, expressed optimism\nabout getting an alternative\nTravel Service for IC students\nvery soon.\nNevertheless, Mr Brayshaw\nis sceptical about the scheme's viability, since NUS Travel\nhad always maintained that\nwinter provided the least\nbusiness of the year. Both he,\nRichard Silver ( UL U President)\nand Marcus Turner ( QM C President) are also disgruntled\nthat Trevor Phillips wants to\nsee LSO running the new bureau. They, and ICU Exec, would prefer to see a more\ngeneral and stable body \u2014 such\nas UL U \u2014 in administrative\ncharge rather than LSO. ICU Executive would show\nmore favour to the scheme if\nassurance that the British Rail Student Card would be available\nfor the bureau to sell were\ngiven. At present, BR has indicated that they are willing to continue the card. Half_ price tickets will still be\navailable to those with Cards; those who have yet to purchase\na card can still do so by writing\nto their British Rail area office. Up till five years ago ICU did have its own travel brokerage scheme which was making\na profit.\nAnother organisation that\nhas already agreed to help\nany new student travel bureaux\nis the Student Air Travel Association(S AT A). This is the central ising body that co ordinates air travel operations\nof many student travel\norganisations across Europe.\nSATA has agreed to become\nan air travel booking agency\nfor any local student travel\nbureaux and provide the\nservices it did to NUS Travel\nThe Austria lian Travel Service, which operated flights\ndown under with NUS has also indicated its wish to help\nthese new bureaux. The Eurotrain facilities may also continue, although negotiations\nare not yet at a conclusive stage.\nThe decision to wind up\nNUS Travel along with 2 NUS printing companies had been\ntaken at an emergency NUS Executive meeting last\nFriday. Throughout that week\nthe Boards of the companies\nhad been exploring ways of\navoiding liquidation. At one\nstage the selling of End sleigh Insurances was considered,\nbut this would not have raised\nsufficient capital to see NUS Travel permanently out of the\nred.\nElVz M LOSS\nNUS Travel crashed with\nlosses just under \u00a3'/4M \u201e Of these the main creditors are\nthe International Student\nTravel Conference and British Rail. Charles Clarke, NUS President, has refrained from\ncommenting on how much each\nis owed, but The Guardian put\nthe amount to British Rail at\n\u00a3'4M.IC Union is in fact owed\n\u00a3300 in back rent for the NUS Travel office a tIC. Nobody on NUS Travel holidays will be stranded due\nto the A BT A bond.\n\" NUS itself lost \u00a380,000 of share capital as a result of STUDENT WORLD\nEDITED BY ANDREW EVANS\nMeans Test Loophole\nThe September issue of' Which', the Consumer Co unc i1's magazine, has exposed another\nloophole in the means-test,\nAccording to ' Which', if a student is over eighteen,\nunmarried, and not earning over\n\u00a3350 a year, the student's parents can pass their parental\ncontribution through a cove nant to their son or daughter.\nThe advantage comes through\ntax relief on the covenant for\nthe parent, and reclaimed tax\nfor the student, providing he\nor she earns less than \u00a3350.\nThe Grab War The Grub War continues at\nCentral London Poly, but the\nstudent strategy of boycotting\nthe New Cavendish and Wells\nStreet Canteens on 16th November is unlikely to starve\nout their adversaries, the\nTaylor plan caterers.\nIn their assault on the New Cavendish redoubt, the\nstudents were he pled by\ninside agents (a shop-steward\nand staff of Taylor plan) and\nby some N UP E members.\nNew College\nHaving tailed to buy New College outright, Westfield\nCollege, London, has agreed\nto rent it from the successful bidder, the Open University. Half of the \u00a335,000 bill for\nrenovations will be met by\nthe University Grants Commission, but on this condition:\nthat New College will become\na mixed, intercollegiate hall\nof residence for post-graduates\nonly.\n(WC)\ncessation of trading of the\nthree companies. On a more\noptimistic line, End sleigh Insurance Brokers, NUS Marketing and the NUS Discount\nScheme will continue trading\nas before.\nTheN US Executive decided to close down the three\ncompanies rather than risk the\nNational Union itself failing\nthrough a banking set-off\narrangement.\nUnder this arrangement the\nNational Union's general\naccount maximum liability was either the amount in the\naccount or the amount overdrawn by the service companies\nas a whole, which ever was the lesser. Hence if the three\ncompanies had not been put\ninto liquidation, a situation\ncould have arisen where a failure of one or all of them\nendangered NUS's survival. Last Friday's action prevented such a failure, although\na little amount of money was\nlost by this set off arrangement when the companies were\nliquidated. The exact amount\nwas not made clear at a Student press conference on\nTuesday. Some student leaders\ndo put this in the region of\n\u00a310-50,000.

Nevertheless the odds were\nagainst this since IC had not\nplayed a competitive match for\ntwo and a half weeks \u2014 due to\nwet weather and a flue\nepidemic at Middlesex\nHospital. Moreover QM C were\nsupremely confident following\ntheir defeat of the reigning\nleague champions, Bedford\nCollege, by 4\u20141 the previous\nweek.\nThe game began at a lively\npace and although QM Chad a slight edge they were refused\ncontrol of the game by an IC side apparently un shaken by\nan exploding coach windscreen\non the way to the match. How. ever, mid-way through the first\nhalf QM C did put the ball into\nthe back of the net only to\nhave the goal disallowed for\noffside,\nPanic - stricken goal\nSoon a tter wards IC took the lead. Steve Bates sent Ian\nHuntingdon clear with a measured through-ball. Still suffering from mild concussion after a clash of heads, Huntingdon experienced a complete\nloss of direction, panicked,\nand drove the ball past the\nkeeper and into the net.\nNevertheless, IC did not\nhold on to their lead for long.\nQ MC's equalise r came from a right wing corner cross that\nwas powerfully headed into\nthe net from close range.\nHalft time 1 - 1.\nUpper hand to QM C With the IC team apparently\naffected by the half time news\nthat England had lost 2\u20140 in\nRome, QM C proceeded to take\ncontrol of the game. IC were\nnow restricted to rare breakaway attacks one of which very nearly brought success when Terry Lind on blasted the ball just over the bar.\nIt was not long, though,\nbefore QM C deservedly took\nthe lead when one of their\nforwards was put right through,\nleaving keeper Kev Allen with no chance. Determined not to allow QM C to do the 'double' over\nthem, IC decided to step up\ntheir work rate and fight for\nevery ball.. This, and a tactical reshuffle which sent\nAndy Baker forward out of defence, finally paid dividends\nwhen with less than 15\nminutes left Baker sent a searing right foot shot in to the\nroof of the net to make it 2\u20142,\nand give ICa share of the\npoints.\nTeam: K Allen, C Howley, R Young, A Baker, D Brabbin, T Grimwade, S Bates, P Frampton, T Lindon, I Huntingdon,\nS Gee.\nBoat Club\nPolice launch thwarts Senior success\nThe senior team had rather\na busy time in their first\nmatch of the season (on 13th November). In the University\nof London Winter V HIs they\nhad to row their semi-final\nand then go straight back to\nthe start for the final against\nUniversity College Hospital. This was really the race\nof the day! A police launch got\nin the way on the course!, setting up an enormous wash\nwhich hit UCH first, causing them to stop. We were leading\nat that point, but the judges\ncalled for a re-row. This was\nclosely contested and \u2014 would\nyou believe it \u2014 was a dead\nhead.\nBack for another re-row!\nThis time the crew felt about\nready to curl up and die \u2014 we\nrowed hard but lost.\nIn addition to the Senior\ncrew, a Junior crew and two\nnovice teams did battle that\nday.\nThe Novice crews had the\nfirst races, the B crew winning\ntheir first race (after 1 month's rowing!). The' A' crew pulled\nsome spectacular crabs by half\ndisappearing in a cloud of\nspray on their start. Sadly\nthey couldn't make up the lost\ndistance.\nThe ' B' crew won their\nsemi final narrowly and then\nlost in the final to Queen Mary\nCollege, who had rowed for\nover a year. A promising\nperformance.\nThe Junior crew rowed two\nhard races and won their\nsemi final and final in excellent style. They made a bad start in their final, but\nby the halfway point rowed\nthrough the opposition to win by IV2 lengths. This made it\nthe third consecutive win. P.S.

IC had several\nplayers absent through injury,\nand were also without KLips combe( who had a problem\nsheet overdue!) and Ian\nMac la in, who had an operatic\nsociety meeting.\nIC started well, playing some good rugby. The forwards\ngave the backs a good share\nof possession, and Alan Gregory scored a good overlap\ntry. The hooker, Sam Heath, alias the Flying Friar, was having an excellent match, and\nin addition he encouraged his makeshift front row, with S Asp den, playing tight-head\nprop. Unfortunately, IC did not\ntranslate their territorial\nadvantage into points, and\nallowed K CH to narrow the\nLadies Hockey\nde fec it to 1 point at by con ceding a penalty at aru ck. The new scrum half, Rocky Hobbs,was having an excellent\ngame, despite trouble wit h his right arm. This arm was severely strained by having to\nlift up Asp den's gut to put the\nball in the scrum. Asp den was\nlater penal is ed at a line out for\ntightening his corset at the\nresultant maul, and KC H's kicker made no mistake.\nAt this stage, M Cotter, would be flyweight champion\nof St Helens, decided the time\nwas right for a sparring\nsession. From the ropes, A Gregory came close to his second try. This was the start\nof a concerted college effort to\nscore; but unfortunately, time\nran out, and K CH ran out rather\nlucky winners, while Asp den undid his corset and got back\ninto his flower pot. Good fight despite human shortage\nIC 1 v Barts Hospital3 IC Ladies Hockey team\nturned out for this league\nmatch against Barts two\nplayers short, one of these\nbeing a goal keeper.\nDue to this shortage of\nplayers we were * forced to\nadopt a rather defensive style\nof play throughout. However,\nthe team put up a good fight and\ntook the lead with a goal from\nDiana. This prompted one of the opposition to remark' Thank\nGod there aren't11 of them'.\nIC held on to this lead for\nsome time until Barts scored their first goal and the score\nremained 1\u20141 until almost the\nend of the match when Barts\nLac j asse got two quick goals. The final score was a disappointing end to a match\nwhich could have been much\nbetter if IC had had a full team.\nSo far the ladies hockey team have had their most successful season for some\nyears. They have played 7\nmatches wit h3 wins,3 losses and 1 draw.\nAnyone who would like to\nplay ladies hockey on a Wednesday or Saturday, please\ncontact Janet Coxage (Bot. Ill)\nor Chris Forsyth (Mat Sci 11).\nGoalkeepers especially\nwelcome.\nMore players needed here too\nImperial College 5\nOn Saturday 20th November\nIC Lacrosse Club played their\nfirst league fixture of the\nseason. As usual IC were two\nplayers short, whereas Bexley heath had a full team. So it\nlooked like the match was\ngoing to be a walkover for\nBexley. This, however, did not\nprove to be the case. In the first quarter this two\nman advantage did not prove\ndecisive \u2014 at least in defence.\nBexley did in fact have\ndifficulty in keeping control\nof the ball, and often lost\npossession through bad passing and catching. The attack had a different\nproblem. Whenever IC attacked,\nBexley' s two extra players would come back arid this\nmeant that every man was marked, leaving two or three\nv Bexleyheath ' A'8 players free to go for the man\nin possession. Hard graft and a refusal to\nloose possession meant that\nIC were attacking Bexley' s goal quite often. At half time\nthe score was3 all. At the start of the third\nquarter Bexley realised that\ntheir best policy was to play\na waiting game. AU they had\nto do was keep possession and look for any unmarked man\ngetting into a good position and then play the easy pass. However their finishing was not so good, and the defence\nand goalkeeper were able to\nbreak up most of Bexley' s attacks. IC's attack continued\nto harass Bexley' s defence\nand managed to get a couple\nmore goals. The final score\nwas 8\u20145 to Bexley heath. "
