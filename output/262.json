Especially for students who have a limited amount of free time bo devote to charity work, the organizers should continually have in mind the relation between the financial return and the effort put into it. The smaller events should be abandoned and the people involved v/ith them appointed to more profitable events. It is appreciated that this could entail an alienation between students of the college and carnival'..' \u2022\nactivities, but I feel that it is only the hardy faithfuls who support the fe te etc anyway.

A quorum was\neventually reached for the twice adjourned IC Union Meeting and it\nalso got through some useful business.\nWhen the meeting opened almost on time there could have been\nfew more than 30 people in the Concert Hall as President Phillips\nproposed his constitutional motion for the second time to admit\n\" disguised students \" into the Union, which was passed unopposed\nand with no-one challenging the quorum. By now there were about\n100 students present and Bob Mackman moved the second reading of\nhis motion to elect the External Affiairs and Welfare Officers and the\nUL U agent from the Union floor at the AGM, and to make the first\ntwo officers of the Union, sitting on Council and heading their own\nsub-committees.\nQuorum\nWith the audience reaching the\nstaggering number of 150 Mike\nEdwards challenged the quorum\n(need it be added successfully?)\nand Phillips adjourned the meeting for ten minutes while commercials for the Silwood, Ball,\nCarnival Fete, Sports Day and\nMines (for those who would like\nto change from RCS or Guilds)\nwere given.\nOn reopening the meeting was\nstill without a quorum but noone challenged it, so Andy Jordan\ncould propose that we affiliate to\nthe Co-ordinating Committee for\nOverseas Students which was\nagain not opposed. Still not quite\na quorum so Phillips asked for\nquestions and was asked by Pete\nDolwin about Mike. Phillips\nreplied that it was hoped that\nMike would shortly be restored\nto his rightful place on his plinth,\nalthough he has not yet been recovered from Kings.\nAnother adjournment, five\nminutes this time, and at last the\nmagic figure of 300 was reached.\nThe real business could be done.\nRory Redmayne proposed his\nwell-publicised motion to abolish\nUGM's( Union General Meetings) which, after some lively\nspeeches was soundly defeated although large numbers abstained\nin the words of Mike Edwards\n\" to show the opposition the\nidea of the motion, but to register\ndisapproval with Union meetings\nthis year.\"\nWalkout\nAs Malcolm Duckett got up to\nspeak on Derek Boothman's motion more or less revising the\nUnion constitution he was faced\nwith a walk-out of about 50\npeople. As it was five to two it is\npossible that this was due to lec-ture s, but more likely it was an\nattempt to block the motion.\nDuckett instead asked that a request by the assembled individuals\nthat Council be asked to set up\na sub-committee to revise the\nconstitution. This was passed\noverwhelmingly.\nThe meeting closed with a question about beer prices and\none on the newspapers in the\nLower Lounge.\n\u00a9 ooo ooo ooo^ VACATION WORK?\n^TRY SOMETHING DIFFERENT!\n( ) Get away from the world of books and study and let\n^ your vacation work be an introduction to Business\nO and Industry.\nMANPOWER has a wide variety of interesting jobs\nto offer both women and men.

However, after\nthe dinner they will have no extra\nprivileges and will have to leave\nthe Union by 11.30. No bartels\nof beer will be sold to them and\nthe reading room and senior\ncommon room, where they have\npreviously remained in a besot ten state until 2 a.m., are to be\nlocked.\nSouthside Bar\nSouthside bar is to be given\nan overhaul. New chairs are to\nbe installed and a new carpet\nwill be laid over the vac, and\nthe marble underneath the bar\nwill be extended by 1^ ft. to prevent the wear which has necessitated the early replacement of\nthe present carpet. The old carpet will be used to cover ICWA's new carpet when the ICWA\nlounge is used for parties.\nPG Lounge ?\nVinod Garga, the overseas\nstudents rep proposed that there\nshould be a lounge in the Union\nspecifically for .use by P.G. s. It\nwas pointed out that this was\ncontrary to the policy of in te gra tion-of UGs and PCs at IC and\nthat PGs were honorary members of the SCR during the vac\nand could use this then.\nVinod suggested that an application for block membership on\nbehalf of all overseas students\nshould be made to the International Students House in Russell Square. Vinod is to investigate the support this would have\nfrom overseas students, and Ray\nPhillips is to look into the possibility of a block membership.\nJUR GO The Joint Union-Rector's Governing Committee which is to sit\nfor the first time this term\u2014old\nJUDCO + Rector=new JURGO\n\u2014was discussed. It decides the\nrepresentation of Council on various external committees such as\nparking, medical health and\ngeneral studies committees.\nStanding Orders\nCouncil approved the standing\norders for Union meetings which\nnad been drawn up using the\nRCS standing orders as a guide.\nIt is to be hoped that after the\nfiasco at the RCS meeting a week\nago that iC manages the practice\nof their standing orders a little\nbetter.\nWelfare and\nExternal Affairs\nThe constitutions for the Welfare and External Affairs Committees were passed and the addition of these two officers to council is to go before the next Governor's meeting for approval on\nJune 12th. The Welfare and External Affairs Officers are to be\nelected at the Union AGM on\nMay 31st, subject to ratification\nof the constitution. If the governing body will delegate this\nratification to a sub-committee\nsitting before June 10th then\nthese of fk sr s will hold voting\npositions at the Joint Council on\nJune 10th, when this year's and\nnext year's Council combine to\nelect the next President and\nSecretary of IC. If not, they will\nnot become voting members until\ntwo days after the Joint Council\nMeeting.\nRobb\nAfter the main business had\nbeen concluded, with little of the\npetty wrangling characteristic of\nmost council meetings, Peter\nJtuhemann started a discussion\nm the work of the Union Secretary. Much strong feeling was\naired about the way Mrs. Robinson carried out her highly complex and responsible job. Personality clashes were blamed as\nusual, and Council made no de-c is ions. EMERGENCY BLEED REACHES CLIMAX The College emergency blood\ndo ning scheme will cease operation on June 1st, so that there\ncan be no possible interference\nwith examination performance.\nBy that time the vast majority of\nthe 150 hall residents on the\nscheme will \"have given blood for\nuse at the ,National Heart Hospital. The National Heart Hospital was the scene two, weeks\nago of Britains first heart trans-plant. Some blood given by IC's Emergency donors was used for\nthis operation.\nThe scheme will be set up at\nthe beginning of next session to\ncontinue supplying the hospital\nwith fresh blood at short notice.\nDr. Patterson, the doctor-in\ncharge Of obtaining blood for the\noperation performed at the hos-pital, expresses his thanks to all\nthose who have turned out to give\nblood on this scheme and hopes\nthat next session a similar number of students will volunteer to\nhelp.\nFor those not on the Emergency scheme it is still not too\nlate to sign up for the latest session which continues to-day and\nto-morrow. It only takes about\nhalf an hour and there are free\nbiscuits and tea.

This i.400 figure relates to the flat whose rent is being queried, and\nnot to the whole house.

After the reading of reports of varying degrees of interest, including Stew Barnes report on Council which was apparently interesting enough for several^ u il dsm gn to want to come in and listen, Bob Mackman\nthis year's president, got straight on to the matter of election. Maria wallis, one of the candidates for secretary, read a letter announcing her withdrawal from the contest because of the confused Presidential situation, and because of the extra strain this would have thrown on her academic work had she been elected. Chris Yew let t, the only other candidate in the poll, was therefore elected Secretary unopposed. Andy Keenan had also resigned as u hemis try rep. after the malpractices of the elections( see main issue), but on the suggestion of Malcolm Duck ett, the meeting refused to accept it. Then to the main business the President, Mackman read a letter from Anita Eur nissan d Rog. Webb, in which they both withdrew from the election because the whole conduct of the first ballot was unsatisfactory and would( presumably) reflect on whoever got elected. They suggested instead that an acting president be appointed until a new election could beheld next. year. After a little u is cus sion, this was agreed on and Rog. Webb immediately nominated Mike Tait in. the light of his experience in a similar capacity last year. However, Keith Cavanagh, last year's president, proposed Jeff iVar ren, last year's secretary for the job and Tait immediately stood down. So the meeting accepted him and Mackman\nmoved on to the next item, the result of the second ballot of the Vice\\ Presidential nomination. In this, Adolf Hash ter oud ian squeezed in by the narrow margin of23 U votes to Pete Dol win's230. The meeting moved on to discuss whether RCSU should pay for some\nmicrophones damaged in last term's smoking concert. The question of whether RCSU was really responsible for the maintenance of order on the occasion was mulled over at some length and the question of payment eventually referred to the Finance subcommittee.

Twelve minutes worth\nof \" A New Dawn\" produced\nlittle worthwhile. Chris Woods\non amplified sax played well\nenough, but Winwood's organ-work was a large-scale disappoint-ment.

SPENCE.\n\\ 0 lot ban\ncolumn.\nAt the end of a year, a number of people get the push. I had\na scaffold put up around my column the other day but fortunately\nthey only cleaned me up. The vitriol I 've been told passes as ink\nwas drained from my pen and I turned a blind eye.\nSabbatical Year?\nThis> year's experience has tended to highlight the need for a sabbatical year for the President. With academic work to do, it is\nhighly impracticable for the President to be in touch with students.\nWith no academic work, he would have the time to go the rounds\nmeeting his fellow students. Far from being a professional President,\nhe could be in better contact with student opinion.\nBut after\nall that has been said and written about Ray Phillips,\nhe did a good job considering the disadvantages he labour ed under.\nHis main disadvantage seems to have been that he has not had a well-considered approach to his job. Many members of the Union and of\nCouncil have thought out carefully a basis for their approach to\nUnion affairs. It is a kind of ideology though it is a personal one and\nrarely Marxist or dogmatic. Ray does not appear to have had this\nkind of approach, with the result that some of his decisions seem to\nhave been taken in isolation from other facts. So it was really inevitable that his pragmatic liberalism should have led to bad feeling when\nit was felt he was being inconsistent.\n\"\nI did,\" said Ray\nA good example of this has just come to light. At last week's Council meeting, someone asked Ray how student house wardens\nhad been selected. \" By myself and the Rector,\" he said. \" And who\ndecided that?\" \" I did,\" said Ray. This seems inconsistent with\nhis constant pressure for further student representation on College\ncommittees. It is hard unless one has been specifically mandated, to\nrepresent by one-self all shades of student opinion. It would therefore seem logical that if there are student representatives on com-mitte es, they should be adequately informed of student opinion. In\nsome matters, this general opinion may be that of a Union meeting, in\nothers that of Council: Council is after all constituted in a way\nthought to be fairly representative of the student body. So it seems\nbad for one student alone to select wardens for student houses. Anyone who has had any experience of job selection will know that it is\nusually done by a panel\u2014otherwise personal prejudice can only too\neasily enter into it. This is especially the case where candidates are\npersonally known to the selectors. Council decided eventually to\nallow the President to select while giving itself the power to veto :\nin addition, it stipulated that the jobs should be advertised within the\nthe College, something not done previously. What Council omitted to\nobserve was that it is awkward to veto a selection after it has been\ndone. The selection should be done by a panel of between three and\nfive students.\nThe sense of consensus\nThis incident seems typical of Ray's attitude. In the first year of\na new Rector striking changes have been brought about in bringing\nstudents into the making of decisions. Much of the credit for this\nmust go to Ray. In addition, he has sh6 w n himself quite able to\nchair Union meetings and even Council meetings\u2014no mean feat,\nwhen many of Council have had much to say on a multitude of sub-j ect s. But he also seems to have taken the view that because he was\nelected President, he automatically represents the student view. This is\nwrong because, first, each election is essentially a compromise and,\nsecond, student opinion can only be gathered through consultation.\nGovernment by concensus may appear to be inefficiently slow, but\nfor there to be cooperation, it is ultimately the only way.\nLowins Lesson\nIt look* at the moment as if Rex Lowin will be next year's President He shall have learnt from this year that one can be in\nti j any ways a, good and fair President but still incur the dislike of\nsome.

Jointly\nawarded the clich6 of the year prize with \" Who is\nRay Phillips anyway\" and \" MJ L to organise,\" it\nhas at least been realised that in a body as diffuse (or dilute?) as\nICU good publicity is essential. What has failed to strike home is\nthat, good publicity \" is not posters; it is telling people. Posters\nmay be a means to an end, but they are certainly not the end. Much\nmore must be done in the field of internal communication. People\nhave been muttering \" year reps,\" \" Constituent colleges,\" \" FELIX \"\nfor just about the whole session and have almost unanimously failed\nto properly use any of these media for communication purposes. If\ninterest in the affairs of the Union is to be re vitali sed( and some of\ntheir affairs are both relevant and interesting, believe it or not), then\nthe most important concept is that people must not only be told that\n\" the affairs of the Union are interesting \" but must also be precisely\ntold what these interesting affairs are and how they affect the Union.\nFurther this must be done on a personal level from the top down.\nSo please next year's Exec, whoever you may be Lowin, tell us what is\nhappening; tell us when and why it is happening\u2014then perhaps\nwe will take a more active interest and offer less destructive criticism.\no USES\u2014that is Student 'Ouses! Of the few real advances this session the progress made with the\nestablishment of student houses has perhaps been the\nmost needed. Initiated last session by Pete Finch and\nRex Lowin this project has, through the work of Ray\nPhillips and Bob Fryer, made fairly swift progress under the guidance\nof the Governing Body; so that now we have not only established the\nprinciple and system of this form of hall/lodging but have also\nobtained two of \" your actual\" houses which will give almost 200\npeople cheap communal board next year.\nL IAISON: While all around us students are demanding\nrepresentation on the governing bodies, ICU\nsuggested it in its usual un reactionary way (or was it\nwell mannered and civilised) that perhaps a voice on\nthe,B.o.G. might be a good idea. The Rector, received\nthis in a manner that we are, I think, coming to recognise as characteristic. Having made a thorough survey of the B.o.G. minutes, he\nproduced a report for Council showing just how little of their business\nwas directly relevant to students, and also pointed out that direct\nrepresentation would anyway be of no use to the Union as the affairs\nof the Board of Governors meetings are confidential and so the student\nrepresentative could not report back to discuss the business within the\nUnion. However, by way of an alternative the Rector suggested\nregular meetings of interested parties at which topics of mutual\ninterest could be discussed. From this has emerged JURGO (Joint\nUnion, Rector, Governors' committee). This committee, which is\ncomposed of ICU Council, the Rector, Pro Rector, the Deans,\nRegistrar, College Secretary and three members of the B.o.G., will\nmeet termly and is expected to discuss such matters as college develop-ment, courses and so on. As an instrument for liaison this should\nprove invaluable and great credit should go to those involved in its\ninstigation.\nOn a more day to day level liaison has been one of the great\nstumbling blocks this year. Although Ray Phillips has set a new high\nin liaison upwards\u2014Union-College Admin\u2014he has also set a new low\ndownwards\u2014President-rest of Union. That there should be the internal\nsituation of the President and the Union, instead of the President of\nthe Union, is sad; but if it does exist then the basic requirement of a working arrangement is first class two-way liaison. There wasn't and\nmuch of the \" why?\" of this brings me onto \" I;\"I NTOLERANCE : There has been an almost vicious\natmosphere of intolerance throughout the Exec,\nCouncil and the Union administration generally for a lot of this session; and there can be nothing less conducive to good liaison than an intolerance of one's colleagues. Perhaps new faces and new effort next session will cure\nwhat appears to be essentially an internal problem.\nTWO D DLE \u2014 I refer of course to the proceedings of\nmost of the business of this year's few quo rate Union\nmeetings!\nNS1PID\u2014This is how I would describe this year's Council. As a body they appear to have achieved\nlittle because individuals have repeatedly drawn back\nfrom carrying through in public views they express\nin private. This seems to have lead to a great frustration, which has been intensified by everyone's failure to recognise\nuntil after the event the cunning P.D.C. T.P. \u2014Phillips Disguised\nCommittee Trampling Ploy!\nON ST IT UTI ON: Making what use we could of the\nfew Union meetings that crawled into quo racy, we've\nsucceeded to constitutionally recognise the External\nAffairs and Welfare committees and failed to elect\nour future Presidents by a ple bi site or to do away\nWith Union meetings.\nS is either for the \" S***ies tS***I 've ever seen \" as\nRobb described this year's Council or on a less earthy\nnote for \" stirring;\" this continues to be the prerogative of those of us whose main interests are the\nUnion's affairs and continues to be as ineffective as\nusual.\n\n"

As there were no nominations the fu st time foe\nSecretary, the nomination papers were put up again and Monday's elections included this post.\nThe trouble erupted at the RCS AGM on Tuesday 14th with accusations of inconsistencies in the ballot held the day before for the\npresidency and vice-presidency of the Union. After a marathon two\nand a half-hour meeting, surely one of the longest and stormiest for\nmany years, it was decided that because of the accusation and the\ncloseness of the vote a new ballot would be taken (see the final result\nin FELIX LATE NEWS),\nThe proceedings began, peaceably enough, with the hustings for\nSecretary, Chris Yewlett being proposed by Tony Bailey and Maria\nWallis by Jon Shields (results again in LATE NEWS). After this,\nproposal speeches and a vote for Assistant Secretary in which Penny\nWalters beat Paddy Sterndale, this year's Queen of Jez. Then tb4 elections for RCS Ents Committee.\nNow, after the lull\u2014the storm.\nPat Haxell accused the people running the Chemistry section of the\nprevious day's ballot of keeping\na record of the direction in which\nthe vote was going and of letting\npeople know who had voted\nwhich way. Les Ebdon followed\nthis up with complaints of a complete lack of privacy for the\nvoters when casting their votes,\nand objections to candidates being\never-present at the ballot tables.\nThere were also complaints that\nMackman had let slip the election\nresults in the bar the night before\nthe AGM, for which Mackman\nlater apologised.\nMissing Votes\nMore serious were doubts\nabout whether the Botany Department had been disenfranchised or not. It was established\nthat some Botanists had voted in\nthe Chemistry box, some had\n(perhaps) voted in the Zoology\ndepartment and it was just possible that some even voted in\nBotany itself. Add to this the fact\"\nthat neither Bob Mackman nor\nMike Tait, who helped with the\ncount, could be certain whether\nany or all of the Botany votes\nwere counted and it becomes apparent just how much of a mess\nthe organization of the polling\nwas!\nFrayed Tempers\nDuring the bickering Martin\nLack had attempted to introduce\na procedural motion to move on\nto other bus in es and Mackman\nhanded over chairmanship of the\nmeeting to Vice-President Mike\nTait and tried to answer Haxell's and Ebdon's charges. In the end,\nAndy Keenan, Chemistry rep, was\ncalled to defend the organisation\nof the Chemistry ballot which he\nseemed unable to do. Mackman\nin t erupted the discussion several\ntimes, trying to say that the vote\nshould stand. Mike Tait did his\nbest to keep the heat down and\ntempers from fraying. Then, at\nlast, some measure of sanity-Malcolm Duckett proposing the\nobvious course of a new ballot.\nFollowing came a huddle of the\npoliticians, with Martin Lack still\ntrying to insist on his motion to\nannounce the results and move on\nto the next business, and everyone\ntrying to work their way through\na mess of regulations and decide\nwhat was to be done.\nFinally the huddle, looking\nnow like an American Football\ntactics discussion, broke up and\nChris Kent spoke the magic numbers : \" I formally propose that a new ballot be taken . . . \" All hell let loose again f Martin Bland\nopposing the decision in front of\nan unsympathetic Union, two\neminently sensible speeches in\nfavour of a new ballot from Frank\nFuchs and Mrs. Judy Poe and\nBob Mackman coming to the end\nof his tether, saying that a new\nballot should be carried out. A paper vote agreed, evidently by a large majority. So democracy\nwon and the new ballot for President and Vice-President was held\non Monday along with the ballot\nfor Secretary (once again see\nLATE NEWS for results).\nAfter all this excitement, the\nrest of the meeting dissolved into\nanticlimax. The usual farce of\nfinding people to fill all positions\nnot already filled and the presentation of social colours and general awards. The adjournment\n(without a Kangela) until y ester day.\nAt the time of going to press\nit seems unlikely that a President\nwill be elected until next session.\nAndy Keenan has since resigned\nFinally, FELIX information on\nthe first ballot is that Rog Webb\nbeat Anita Furniss for President\nby about 50 votes, with Peter\nDolwin scraping through by 7\nvotes from Adolf Hashteroudian\nfor the Vice-Presidency.\nPAUL HEATH President's D&D The President's Dinner and\nDance on Friday, 21st June, the\nlast day of term, will this year\nhave its benefits spread more\nevenly over the participants. A smaller dinner than last year's marathon (which had to have a break during the seven courses to\ngive people a chance to recover)\nwill be attended by less ex-officio\npeople {e.g. Council members)\nand more invitations will go to\nclub chairmen.\nFor those getting dance only invitations a buffet supper will be\nincluded and about 70. of these\nwill be on sale soon at \u00a3l double,\nto cover the cost of the food.\nDancing will be from 9 till 3 to\nthe Don Brewer Quintet (who\nplayed at the May Ball) and a dis-co the que.

    "content": "Z2 MAY1968 FELIX3 EDITOR'S Comment The end of the year is fast arriving and the time has come when, if\none is not too busy thinking about exams, with the reduction, or to\nbe more precise, the almost total cessation of Union activities, to look\nback over the year, to identify the successes and failures, to think of\nhow to consolidate the successes and to aVoid the failures next time.\nLet us be optimistic and take the successes first. The things which\nimmediately spring to mind are Carnival, Ents and, of course, the\nhabitual success of all the clubs, both in terms of inter coll cge competition and in their normal activities, too numerous to mention in a. whole year's FELIX issues, let alone this short column.\nBuilding on the foundations laid last year by Jerry Stockbridge,\nChris Palmer has significantly increased Carnival's contribution to the\n\u00a35,000 mark. The two big factors in this achievement have been the\nAlbert Hall concert with Donovan and the street collections by the\nconstituent colleges, notably* Guilds/ 1\nThe near-abolition of Carnival\nweek has removed a lot. of the dead wood, but at the same time\ndestroyed the focal point of the activities. This year the only Carnival function which most of the College has been able actually to\nparticipate in has been the street collecting. Carnival, after all, does\nbelong to the whole College and the danger is that it will become a small super-efficient organisation, out to extract as much money as\npossible for the least effort.\nEnts, despite frequent rows both internally and with the executive,\nhave succeeded in both lining the Union coffers to a considerable\nextent and providing high class entertainment. Whether in the present\nstate of the Union finances Ents should aim to make a profit is\ndebatable. I hope that when the fee increase comes through the\nUnion will be able to sub sid is e their functions since Ents, like FELIX,\nis one of the few organisations from which most members of the\nUnion can benefit.\nWhat about the failures? There have; as is inevitable in any such\nbody as IC Union, been many of these, but few have been of more than\npassing concern. There has, however, been a general feeling around\nof impotence and irrelevance, a feeling that the people \" at the top \"\nhad lost touch with, to coin a phrase, the grass roots of the Union and\nthe Union was not capable of handling their interests anyway. . -The problem, of course, goes much deeper than personalities/and\nconstitutional changes. Although these,may be part of it, I think that\nthe increasing difficulty of degree courses and disenchantment with\nthose who appear to seek posts for the status they afford are more\nfundamental.\nThe remedy is neither simple nor obvious, but it seems to me\nthat the biggest problem to be tackled will be in that magic word\n\" communication \"\u2014the two-way flow of information and opinions\nbetween those elected to serve and those who elected them.\nAs this is the last editorial this session, I would like to take this\nopportunity to thank all members of the FELIX staff for the work\nthey have put in throughout the year as well as those who have sent in\ncontributions, even though they may not have been printed.\nDefendatum\nAngelicum\nVatican III,\nBabylon.\nDear Sir,\nWe assure Messrs.

Do\nthose two simpletons dare contest the very words of His Holiness Pope Innocent III, Saint\nJerome, Saint Ambrose and Cardinal Newman\u2014words that speak\nfor themselves and which have\nno need to be interpreted, s0 clear and unmitigated are they!\nHad the Holy Fathers of the\n\"Mater Ecclesiae\" a \"ghetto-like \" mentality too ?

(FELIX 8th May) that \" if the mountain won't come to Mp*&\nham ed. Mohamed niu st go to the f\" mountain.\" Such a statement is\nfound very offensive by all Muslims as it is devoid of facts and is\naimed at casting aspersions not\nonly at the Prophet Muhammad\n(May Allah keep him safe and\ngrant him peace) but at the religion of Islam also. The same\nstatement recently quoted in The\nTimes led to widespread demonstrations in parts of the Muslim\nworld and the newspaper had to\napologise.\nThe mediaeval Christians who\nfabricated this story of an attempt\nby the Prophet Muhammad (may\nAllah preserve him and grant him\npeace) at miracles knew full well\nthat the story was not true. Their\nargument that untruth could\njustifiably be used to protect\nwhat they believed to be the\nTruth, i.e. their faith, will not be .\ncontended here. .What is a maz^| i tag is that the same slOgan is sf tlf)\" being repeated almost 1,000 years\nafter by those who are supposed\nto be much more, enlightened; and\nmuch better e ducat^.

Hon. Sec. UL U Humanist Soc.\nJEWS IN THE USSR Dear Sir,\nFor many years a grave Jewish\nproblem has existed in in th\u00a3\nU.S.S.R. The Tsars and the\nRussian Church persecuted the^\nJews. To-day, over 50 years after /\nthe Communist revolution, the\nposition of the Jewish minority in\nthe U.S.S.R. has again become\na matter of great concern.\nThe disabilities from which the\nJews in Russia suffer today are\nnumerous,\nIn the communal sphere the\nJewish minority is the only one\ntoday which is not allowed to\nhave any distinct collective organisation of its own, either cultural or religious.\nThe possibility of maintaining\nregular contact between, for in-stance, the Jewish communities in\nMoscow and Kiev is denied to\nthem. Even in Tsarist days regular meetings were allowed. However non-Jewish minorities and\nreligious, groups do not suffer\nfrom similar restrictions.\nIn the cultural and religious\nspheres the restrictions in existence are of a shattering nature.\nThere is not a single Jewish\nschool. Jews are denied ff ie opportunity to serve in the Russian\ndiplomatic service. The hierarchy\nof the Communist party too is\npractically free from Jews.\nOfficially the number of Jews\nin the Soviet Union is given as\nabout 2,268,000. Students of Russian statistics suggest that the\nfigure is well within the region of\n3,000,000: About half a million\nJews have openly declared themselves as the element which persists in using Yiddish as their\nmother tongue. There, is no school\nJa Russia in which Yiddish is\nti gig ht. Other minor rpS ha\u00abe schools which teach the f rna tiB in al language. ~w The Jewish religion has been\nsingled out for special treatment;\nThe baking of Matzos\u2014unleavened bread\u2014was forbidden\nfor some years. Many antisemitic books are published the most\ncrude being \"Judaism Without\nEmbellishment\" by T.K. Kitchko, published under the\nauspices of \" The Ukranian\nAcademy For Sciences \"; this was\neventually withdrawn after being\ndenounced by the Western Communists, among others. Kitchko,\nwho at the time was dismissed\nhas recently been reinstated and\nawarded the \"Diploma of Honour\nof the Supreme Soviet of the\nUkraine.\"\nSynagogues have continually\nbeen closed. In 1953 the official\nnumber was 450, in 1963 it wa j f97 and the current unofficial est i\" mate is 62.\nThe Jewish community, unlike\nother religious minorities, is not\nallowed to maintain contacts with\nworld bodies. The Russian Orthodox Church, for instance, is a member of the World Council of\nChurches and has permanent\nrepresentatives in Geneva. Even\nthe small number of Buddists are\nin a better position than the Jews.\nTo give one more example: \u2014\nsome half million Baptists in the\nU.S.S.R. have about 5,000\nchurches and chapels. This means\none church for every 100 wor-X Asst.

In the case of the Jews\nthere is One synagogue for every\n48,000 worshippers. There are\nJewish communities in, the\nU.S.S.R. today numbering between thirty and forty thousand\npeople without a single synagogue\nleft open for worship.\nThere are still many Jewish\nfamilies split by the Second World\nWar. The Soviet government has\ndone little to help them be re-united. During a visit to Park\n(9th December 1966) Mr. Kosy\",\ngin said, \" As far as concerns the\nreunification of families, if certain\nfamilies desire to be reunited, or\nto leave the Soviet Union, the\ndoor is open to them, and in this\nrespect there is no problem.\" Mr.\nKosygin's statement,was reprinted\nin \"Izvestia.\" However this\nstatement was later played down;\nafter June f967 the Soviet authorities stopped most Jewish\nemigration.\nRecently* the Soviet authorities\nhave substituted the word Zionist\nfor Jew in their antisemitic propaganda thus trying to avoid\nwestern criticism of antisemitism\nin the U.S.S.R. \"Komsomol-s kaya Pravda \" states, quoting a reliable foreign source, \" The\nZionist lawyers comprise about\n70 per cent of all the American\nlawyers; the physicists, including\nthose engaged in secret work on\nthe preparation of weapons for\nmass destruction, comprise 69 per\ncent and the industrialists more\nthan 43 per cent.\" The actual\nsource, which turns out to have\nbeen written in Cairo by a Naz4\nfugitive states, \" The proof of the\nhigh position attained by Jews in\nAmerican Society is apparent\nfrom the following list compiled\nfrom data published in 1950::\nLawyers\u201470 per cent; Physicians\n\u201469 per cent; Merchants\u201477\nper cent; Industrialists\u201449 per\ncent; Labourers\u20142 per cent;\nFarmers\u20141 per cent.\" Looking\nat these two versions we can see\nthat present day Russian antisemitic propaganda is worse than\nNazi propaganda.\nThis Soviet propaganda makes\nJews appear as the enemies of the;\nworld. It is designed to forcibly\neliminate the identity of the\nJewish community in the U.S.S.R. The Jewish minority is being\ndenied its basic human rights and\nis in danger of disappearing as a national and religious entity.\nA world-wide student campaign\n; is being carried out on their be-half. Anyone who is interested\nor desires to help should contact\nL. Finkelstein, Physics II.\n\n"

To this end,\neighteen souls pitched camp just\noutside the town and made frivolous merriment each evening, accompanied by guitar-twanging,\ncomplaints in three languages,\nand crate? of sub sidi sed beer supplied by the British Army.\nIt is worthy of record that not\nonly was it shown beyond all\nreasonable doubt that an I.C. student could consume more Carlsberg ale per unit time than an\narmy private, but he could also\nperform more incredible feats of\ndiving.\nThe liaison between I.C. and\nB.A. O.R. \u2014seconded to France\nfor \" Adventure \" training\u2014blossomed day by day until the\nOfficer Commanding was personally recharging the club's aqua-lungs and chaufFeuring would-be\ngenerals to diving sites in Army\nlaunches.\nFor the benefit of readers who\nare unfamiliar with the events involved in a typical day's diving,\nplease pull on your swimming\ntrunks and read on. (Ladies need\nnot bother with their bikini tops\nat this stage).\nThe day usually starts at the\nungodly hour of 9 a.m. when\ngaggles of groaning mortals\nemerge from their tents and try\nto come to terms with their hang-overs. Breakfast consists of the\nfollowing ingredients: insipid\nbrown fluid which purports to be\ncoffee; and hard-boiled egg\nrolls. (As a sequel to these and\nother meals, the female catering\nofficer has since been sold to a lusty 25-stone Eskimo cannibal.)\nAfter this delicacy everyone\ntravels to the chosen diving site,\nunloads all the gear, and spends\nthe rest of day shivering.\nThe divers dive from an inflatable boat, always in pairs or\nthrees to double or treble the\ndanger as the case may be, and in\nspite of overwhelming odds such\nas huge waves and man-eating\nsharks, some are known to have\nactually reached the boat again\non re-surfacing. The log reveals\nthat they found a number of oc-top us, starfish, and even a dog-fish-like aquatic animal which is\nreported to have survived the\nthrust of a nine-inch diver's knife. The sole (pun unintended)\neye-witness and operator of the\nsaid knife insist that the weapon\nbounced, yeah bounced, from the\nhead of this vast creature but a good deal of speculation remains.\nIt is not untrue that the immensity of the beast increases with\nthe number of times that the\nstory is recounted.\nThe experienced collectors returned from the sea with coral,\nSponge, fern, sea-urchins and\nother souvenirs, notably a sign\nwhich read : \"Interdit au public,\"\nborrowed from an underwater\npublic convenience.

At these depths, the\nnitrogen content of the air\nbreathed from aqualung can give -rise to hallucinations or an effect\nnot unlike that produced by overindulgence of al coh6l. It goes\nwithout saying that the achievement of great depth was a popular pastime.\nFor the sake of posterity,\nunderwater photographs were\ntaken, but the display of these\nhas proved un entertaining compared with those taken on the\nshore!\nOne member of the team was\neven working! This work \u2014\nsome would say research \u2014 required the participation of at\nleast two other divers and definitely pushed back the frontier\nof the science of underwater\ncommunication. The research\nwas a prelude to an expedition\nwhich will take place in Malta\nduring the summer, but now the\nin trip id adventurers have returned to this sceptre d isle, complete with Ambre-Solaire sun-tans, to indulge in one of the\nlesser activities of a university\u2014\n\u2022studying.\nP.S. \u2014\" Have you anything to\ndeclare ?\" said the Customs\nofficer.\n\" 200 Woodbines, a bottle of\nred wine, and a90 per cent proof\nbladder,\" came the muffled reply\nthrough the alcoholic haze at the\nback of the Underwater Club\nvan.\nAthletics Success\nLYC25 Three months of agitation and demonstration by NUS have\nmade no difference at all to the Government's intention to halve the\nrecommended grants increase to students.\nFrom October students in Oxford, Cambridge and London will\nget an extra \u00a325, while students elsewhere will get another \u00a320. The\nnew maximum grants will be \u00a3395 and \u00a3360 respectively. Students\nliving at home will get an extra \u00a315 and students resident at Colleges\nof.

This\npaper was produced by a printer\ncalled Tom Wooler whose editorial policy was very close to the\ndeclared policy of the board of\nthe revived: \" Black Dwarf.\" He\nwanted the paper to \" lead a consistent struggle for the day-to-day\ninterests of the working masses\nand ward off all attacks on their\nstandard of living\" and \"to make\nuse of every partial demand to explain the necessity of revolution\nand show the impossibility of\neven a moderately serious and\nlasting, let alone fundamental, im-prove ment, so long as the po wei of capital is maintained.\"\nThose aims seem so stringent\nthat it is a wonder that the paper\ncan appear at all. Furthermore,\nwhen they say that they do not\nwant a readership for the advertisers' benefit the financial\nstrength of the |paper must be\nquestionable. Much of the initial\nmoney has come from donations\nfrom the more prosperous capitalist hating left-wingers and from\nadvance subscriptions. The Editorial Board have possibly contributed considerably.\nThe best known personality\nconnected with The Black Dwarf\nis, as William Hardcastle puts it\n\" our friend from Grosvenor\nSquare, Tariq Ali\" whose political beliefs seem to be embodied\nin this paper. It is published from\nthe office of a literary agent, Clive\nGoodwin, who made a name for\nhimself by publicly admitting that\nhe -moke d cannabis. He admits\nthai the paper tends to be destructive rather than constructive but\nfeels that this is partially the prerogative of a\" free \" newspaper.\nHe tends to despise what he\nlabels as \" the un-free press,\" for\nit dos not write about real politics and real news and only puts\nforward one side of the argument\nin a strike (and that, comrades, is\nnever the workers' side).\nThe \" startling \" revelations to\nbe made by the Black Dwarf will\npossibly lead them into libel action unless they follow the course\nof Tom Wooler who, on being\ncharged with writing seditious\nand libellous material, explained\nthat he had not written a word, he\nhad simply set it up in print.\nThe name \"Black Dwarf\" is\nvery ill-advised as almost inevitably it will get associated with\nthe \" Black Power \" movement.\nMany problems are almost nonexistent until they are put forward\nand people start looking for them\nand so while the paper, with a hoped-for circulation of 25,000,\nexpressly denies any intention of\ncausing unrest it would be naive\nto expect this aim to be achieved,\nholding the radical views it does.\nAnyone who believes \" Axel\nSpringer today, Cecil King to-morrow\" will probably agree with\nwhat the Black Dwarf has to say,\nbut you do not have to be as\nvirtuous as Lord Beeching thinks\nIC students are to find the Black\nDwarf a little too much to\nstomach. Several people do not\nmind attending a Trafalgar\nSquare rally from time to time,\nbut one a fortnight is a little too\nmuch.\nJOHN SOMMER\nWHAT HAPPENS IN 69?\nAt Guilds Open Day, last au-tum n, people crowded into EE101 to gaze at the computer. It\nlooked so sleek and modern that\nthey did not realise that they\nwere looking at a computer's equivalent of a tank engine. It\nworks all right but it's just too\nsmall.\nThe main problem is that the\namount of work it is required to\ndo is doubling each year, and\nwith an increasing number of re-reach projects involving computer work this rate is going to be\nmaintained for the foreseeable\nfuture.\nSome years ago IBM loaned\nthe college its then most powerful computer, the 7090, with an\na ot fifi on al1401. Very recently\nthis was made into an IBM 7094\nMk II and an IBM 1460 arrived\nto help deal with the increasing\nwork load. Originally, IC could\nonly use the computer for a third\nof the time, but now this has\nbeen more than doubled. Even\nso, this million pound mass of\nwires is stretched to full capacity.\nIC's agreement with IBM terminates in 1969 and they will then\nprobably want it back.\nLuckily there will not b ft a blank in computing facilities\nafter that for the University of\nLondon is lashing out 1^ million\non a CDC 6600 with a direct link\nto I.C. It will be available for\ncollege use for about half the\ntime. Sadly the total capacity of\nmis machine is only four times\nours so by 1970 it will already\nbe overloaded.\nAt present there seems to be\nno plan for purchasing a new\ncomputer\u2014delivery time is about\ntwo years\u2014so what is going to\nhappen in 1970 is anyone's guess.\nSomebody has been incredibly\nshort-sighted because nowadays\nit is not high speed lifts and hot\nand cold running water in every\nroom that attracts scientists; it\nis computing facilities. Without rapid planning in the next\nfew months, Imperial College\nwith all its claims about being\nat the forefront of scientific\nlearning is going to be lost far\nbehind in the technological race\nit is supposed to be leading.\nIt's die new-look Albert Hall! Startling rev eia tio as of a BrMf*\nRailways takeover in the next amazing issue.\nBEITER BIT OF\n1E%t Albert Hall\nTo over 95 per cent of the\nstudents at Imperial College, Silwood will just be a name on the\nnotice board associated with\nTouchstone activities. But the\nconverse is also true, that the\nstudents at Silwood perhaps\nknow South Kensington better as\nthe home of the Albert Hall\nthan of the vast I.C. metropolis.\nThis lack of knowledge about\nSilwood, only 30 miles away, is,\nI suppose, not unnatural, due to\nthe minority of students working\nthere \u2014 at the moment approximately 80 in toto. Since the\nresident students are all post-graduates, involved in deep(?) research work, they show little interest in the affairs of South\nKensington, and the main part\nof the Union and are consequently out of touch.\nThe College Field Station\nwhich was originally established\nin Slough, in the buildings now\noccupied by the Government Pest\nInfestation Laboratory, moved\nto its premises at Silwood Park\nafter the war, in 1947. Basically\nit is the field station for the Zoology Department, with over half\nthe zoologists specialising in en-tom ology.. The'Botany Department has also a large section at\nthe Field Station and this appears\nto be gradually increasing. For\nfour years, the University of\nLondon Reactor has been operational at Silwood, and this is the\nscene of much activity at the mo-ment, with an extension lab.\nbeing built. Meteorology and\nGeophysics have small units on\nthe Field Station, but with few\npersonnel. Annual invasions of\nCivil and Mechanical Engineers\noccur and various other courses\n\u2022bow up from time to time.\nTHIS IS SILWOOD\nThe Uaion at Silwood is represented by a small Silwood Park\nCommittee, the chairman of\nwhich at:\npresent is that flamboyant figure, Mr. Terry Price.\nThis committee looks after the\nday-to-day running of the sports,\nsocial and other facilities and is\nintimately bound up with the run-ing of the Hostel. The Hostel at\nSilwood is situated in the main\nhouse and adjacent huts, there\nbeing a unique situation where\nsome people actually live in\nrooms above the laboratories in\nwhich they work. Compared to\nMooney's, the food at Silwood is\nof .a decidedly better quality, but\ndiffers in that there is no choice\nof me jal unless you have a particular dislike for a certain foodstuff and tell Paddy, the chef, be-forehand. Paddy on ft vo or three\noccasions of the year really goes\nto town and provides a tremendous spread at Dinner-in-Hal!\nand Summer Ball. Apart from\nthe students living in Hostel, a large proportion live out\u2014^either\nby choice or of necessity. There\nis no accommodation for married\nstudents and since everyone is\npostgraduate, approximately one-third are married. They find\naccommodation in the notorious\n\"Blue Star,\" or various abodes,\nas far away as London.\nAnother outstanding feature of\nthe Field Station community is\nits inter nationality. Overseas\nstudents comprise over half the\npopulation and 30 nationalities\nare currently represented at Silwood. The good harmony and\ngenerally friendly relations between races are features that\nwould gladden the heart of any\nUN official. Coupled with this\nharmonious atmosphere is a very\ngood staff-student relationship,\nwhich is seldom to be found at\nSouth Kensington. Of course,\nthis is inevitable in such a small\ncommunity and is evidenced by\nthe many staff patronising Silwood dances.\nTo conclude, though Silwood\nis an isolated community which\nsuperficially appears to shun\nstrangers, it will be found, on\nfurther examination, that Silwoodians are no more different\nfrom, and no less interesting than\nSouth Kensingtonites, but, if\nanything, are more friendly, due\nto this very factor of isolation.\nThis year is the 21st Anniversary of the Colleges' takeover of\nSilwood. To celebrate, an anniversary Ball is being held there\non June 7th from 9\u20144.30 with\ntwo Band, plus West Indian\nSteel Band. Free champagne\ntoast. Appjyibefore Friday to\nB.C. Folland, Silwood Park.\nAscot. Berks* 30/- single ticket\n, P. MADDISON.\nThe Royal Albert Hall, th 1\nmonstrosity familiar to most observant people frequenting t! area, was probably some old\nroundhouse transported stone by\nstone from America and rebuilt\nas per London Bridge. There are\nvarious opinions expressed on its\nvisual properties : \" Gee tha\nswell.\" (Let's hope it doesn't) more usually \"Eurugh!\" Sor\npeople like it, notably Americ. \u2022\nand the resident BBC sound\ng in e ers who like the a co usc properties which, with a bit of\ndiddling, can help produce st- -o recordings second to none. Bat\nmost people say it sounds good;\nthat it, except for a few Beit\nresidents. Of course it has its\nuses. There's boxing most nights\nand the L.S.O. most other nights\nwith Jimi Hendrix or wh w\" thrown in for good measure, usually with John Peel.\nNot only has South Ken got\n\" The Alb.\"; its got the museums\nand they draw the crowds. That's bad. But the crowds draw the\nice-cream vendors and that's wicked. However, compared with\nthe coaches the mausoleum attracts they're a godsend.\nThe other night the Queen gave\na live performance and as usual\nthe masses flocked to see her. The\nBrownies, the Lifeboys, the old\nwomen from Clacton, the cars\nand worst 'of all the coaches-^-coaches packed with senile doddering pensioners out for a thrill;\ncoaches packed with disinterested\nkids and their equally noisy\nparents; luxury coaches packed\nwith stale air and rubbish.\nThey all turned up.\nThat night Liz drew over 35\nchara ban cs into Prince Consort\nRoad. They triple parked, they\nquadruple parked. Four huge'\nglass bulls in line abreast thwarting all traffic flow. They bon ke d, the cars bon ke d, the people\nwailed, screamed and cater-wau led. Prince Consort Road\nwas packed so tight not another\nvehicle could have entered. It\nwas like a mad fair-ground. Have\nyou ever tried writing lab reports\nat a fair, lei alone a mad fair. I SP,/ we sell the eyesore and ear-sore back to the Yanks.\n\n"
