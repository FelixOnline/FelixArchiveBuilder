    "content": "There\u2019s a load of crap on TV again\nFelix TV comes out of hibernation ready to gorge, but which television celebrity offers the best advice?\nThe New Year\u2019s TV schedules\nwasted no time in reviving our seasonal obsession with obesity and\nhealth, capitalising as ever on the\nguilt associated with the traditional\nfestive excess.\nITV served up Drastic Gastric\nSurgery in the wake of the decision\nto offer stomach surgery on the\nNHS for the first time to severely\noverweight children who carry a\nhigh likelihood of developing cardiovascular disease and diabetes.\nPresented by Ricky Grover, the\n\u2018huge and hirsute\u2019 writer and come-dian, the programme looked at the\nrisks and benefits of weight-loss\nsurgery.\nSurgery is very much the last\nchance saloon for clinically obese\nindividuals who fail to control their\nweight through conventional diet-ing, exercise or medication. The\nvarious approaches are all designed\nto make the stomach smaller so\nthat less food is needed to fill it. The\nfeeling of fullness is what makes us\nsatisfied and stops us craving more.\nWith a lessened appetite and a reduced calorie intake, a substantial\nand life-saving loss of fat becomes\nfeasible.\nThe BBC3 documentary Fat Boy\nTo Slim covered the same topic\nthrough the eyes and words of a\nmorbidlyobeseteenager,JackGlas-sett, as he first tried unsuccessfully\nto lose weight, and then weighed up\nhis options with family, doctors and\nEddie Wawrzynczak former patients. The programme\nshowed the long process of preparing for surgery, the operation itself,\nand the necessary post-operative\nprocedures. The good news is that\nJack lost weight and survived the\ntemptation of his first Christmas\ndinner.\nWatching these programmes, one\nwas left in no doubt that extreme\nobesity is no joke and that surgery\nis by no means a straightforward\nsolution to the problem. Leaving\nto one side the potential complica-tions, the full benefits of weight-loss surgery can only be realised if\nthe patient is careful to avoid high\ncalorie food and drink. In effect, the\noperation can only be life-chang-ing if the person\u2019s life does actually\nchange.\nLifestyle change was also the\ntheme of the third dish on offer.\nChannel 4\u2019s contribution is a new\nseries of You Are What You Eat,\nfeaturing the infamous Gillian\nMcKeith and ominously subtitled\nGillian Moves In (Tuesdays, 8pm).\nThe format involves the self-styled\nholistic nutritionist scouring \u2018the\nfat of the land\u2019 to identify \u2018supersize\nslobs\u2019 with \u2018thick hides\u2019 and diets\nlike \u2018porky pigs\u2019. She traps two unwary subjects in her TV home and\nthen subjects them to a draconian\ndiet and exercise regime.\nIn the first programme, Ian and\nSharon were confronted with a\nfood-laden table showing the full\nhorror of their weekly intake of salt,\nsaturated fat, and monosodium\n10 felix Friday 19 January 2006\nTV tv.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nglutamate. This gave McKeith the\nopportunity to swipe the stodge\npetulantly onto the floor and stamp\nall over it. Following further humili-ations, the pair was sent home with\n\u2018recipes, rules and reassurance,\u2019\nonly to be visited again so that the\nevil diet witch could trash the kids\u2019\ncrisps as well.\nMcKeith has been the target of\nheavy criticism for advocating diets\nthat have little scientific support,\nbut there were only fleeting signs\nof such barminess here. On the\ncontrary, the little information and\nadvice she offered seemed modest\nin its claims. And after eight weeks,\nboth inmates had lost two stones in\nweight. Ian could now play football\nwith his son for more than a minute\nand Sharon was out shopping for\nsexy lingerie again.\nMcKeith is also well known for her\nobsession with crap. Her goal is the\nperfect poo: smooth, soft and easy to\npass. For aficionados, that\u2019s a type 4\nstool \u2013 like a sausage or snake \u2013 according to the official Bristol Stool\nForm Chart. True to form, McKeith\ndid not disappoint her fans as she\nduly inspected the captives\u2019 disappointing and disgusting turds.\nShitwasalsofirmlyonthemenuin\nthe first of a new series, The Truth\nAbout Food, going out on BBC2\n(Thursdays, 9pm). The series aims\nto reveal the science behind the\nfood we eat and what it does to our\nbodies. As the first of six well-known\npersonalities slated to present the\nshow, newsreader Fiona Bruce enthusiastically examined different\naspects of food with the help of \u2018top\nscientists\u2019 and guinea pigs plucked\nfrom a willing public.\nAmiable truckers Don and Wolfgang demonstrated the importance\nof dietary fibre as they drove across\nEurope. High fibre replaced their\nconventional fare of greasy-spoon\nfry-ups and tinned food straight out\nof the can. The new diet helped the\ntruckers get their transit time \u2013 the\ntime food takes to traverse the tunnel between mouth and anus \u2013 from\none to two days down to about 12\nhours, helping to clear potentially\ncancer-causing toxins from the\nGilliam McKeith demonstrates the perfect type 4 stool in You Are What You Eat \u2013 Gillian Moves In\nbowels.\nThe workings of the gut were\nfurther illustrated with the help of\nthe \u2018pill cam\u2019, a neat piece of technology in the form of a large pill\nkitted out with its own lights, camera and video link. Swallow the pill\nand it goes with the flow, filming\nthe sights on the way and showing\nus the delights within. There were\nalso some helpful graphics to show\nthe pill passing through the system.\nIt was good science but as Don put\nit: \u201cI can\u2019t stop the truck every two\nhours to take a shit.\u201d\nThe young ranchers working in\nColorado, on the other hand, were\nmore than happy to contribute their\ndroppings as often as needed. One\ngroup dined on vegetables containing high levels of \u2018prebiotic\u2019 nutrients known to stimulate the proliferation of beneficial organisms in\nthe gut. A second group ate \u2018probiotic\u2019 yoghurt containing live healthy\nbugs. Faecal analysis showed that\nthe vegetables were better at increasing the good bacteria over the\nbad ones. The side effect of eating\nartichokes, leeks and onions was\npredictable.\nMuch farting and latrine humour\nwas also evident among volunteers\nliving in a compound at Paignton\nZoo and surviving on 5 kg of raw\nfruit and vegetables daily, a diet\nsimilar to that enjoyed by apes in\nthe wild and by our ancestors millions of years ago. Just 12 days of\nthis unusual torture succeeded in\nreducing the participants\u2019 cholesterol levels by more than 20%, a\ngood thing given the role of cholesterol in heart disease, and it also reduced weight and blood pressure.\nThe Truth About Food seems to\nhave hit upon a formula combining\nthe best of all worlds: the smiling\ncelebrity presenter shown in a new\nlight,thelikeablemanandwomanin\nthe street, easy-to-understand food\ntrials, genuine scientific experts on\ncamera, the use of clever graph-ics, and a range of bite-sized topics.\nWith presenters like Vic Reeves,\nJan Ravens and Colin Jackson, and\ntopics like sex, sport and sunbathing yet to come, there is something\nfor everyone in this series.\nIf all this were not enough, hypochondriacs may be interested in\nanother new series to be screened\nby BBC2 on Tuesdays at 8pm. The\ncheerily titled Don\u2019t Die Young\nplans to demystify the inner workings of the body to help us better\nunderstand how lifestyle impacts\non lifespan. Each programme will\nlook at a particular organ and how\nto look after it, the first taking a look\nat kidney function with the help of\na bare-backed volunteer and a\npaintbrush.\nSo, the start of 2007 offers the\ncouch potato multiple opportunities to cosy up in front of the telly \u2013\nhome-delivery pizza, bottle of fizzy\nrot, and remote control to hand\n\u2013 to ponder our pre-occupation with\nbodily functions and to imagine how\ngood it would be to escape our mod-ern, unhealthy way of living.\n\u2018Pill cam\u2019: it goes\nwith the flow,\nshowing us the\ndelights within\n\u201cI like my mashed potato with lumps in!\u201d \u2013 Hobag\nWatch TV?

Also present in an official capacity were John Collins\n(Union President), Jon Matthews\n(Deputy President, Finance &\nServices), and Ben Harris (Deputy\nPresident, Education & Welfare).\nThe current RCSU \u2018office\u2019 is located in the Blacklett Lab entrance, in\nthe seating area. The RCSU President, Jad Marrouche, has referred\nto it as \u201ca cupboard\u201d. They also\nhave some space in the Sir Alexander Fleming building. The other\ntwo faculty unions (CGCU, representing engineers, and ICSMSU,\nCollege Estates go back on a decision to give the RCSU a new\noffice on the walkway instead of their \u201cbroom cupboard\u201d\nrepresenting medics) both have\nsizable offices close to the students\nthey are representing.\nBefore the Christmas break, the\nRCSU were shown two locations\nas possible new offices to replace\nthe space they currently have. The\nfirst was the old print shop on the\nwalkway, which has recently been\nvacated.\nThe second was in Princes Gate,\non the other side of Exhibition\nRoad. The room is currently being used as \u201ctemporary storage for\ncleaners\u201d, possibly College-speak\nfor a broom cupboard.\nNaturally, the RCSU executive\npreferred the room on the walkway,\nwhich is close to their students,\nand sizable. The proposed space\nin Princes Gate is reported to be\nin bad condition, as is the access\nroute. Additionally, the office is far\nout of the way.\nIt seemed that an agreement had\nbeen reached that the RCSU could\nhave the space on the walkway,\nwith Estates staff sending an email\nreading: \u201cThis space was used by\ncommercial tenants and I shall inform you when the legal issues for\nthe transfer of the space are final-Andy Sykes\nEditor-in-chief\nThe assembled throng, complete with office furniture, couches, and semi-functional computer\nCollege staff have expressed concerns about the pricing of access to\nthe new Ethos sports centre.\nInitially, the sports centre was\navailable for use by everyone, staff\nand students, for free - this was\nthanks to money \u2018left over\u2019 from the\nconstruction, obtained from various funding bodies including the\nNational Lottery. Staff, however,\nare finding the new Ethos pricing\nscheme unwieldy. In order to use\nthe building, they must pay an annual cost of \u00a3216 which is taken from\ntheir salaries on a monthly basis.\nThis suits staff who use the centre\nfrequently, but has upset a number\nof staff that use the sports centre on\na more casual basis. Without paying\nthe annual fee, there is no way they\ncan use the facilities, as no \u2018pay as\nyou go\u2019 system exists.\nMembers of staff that contacted\nFelix have used the example of departmental football games. These\nare often organised on a purely casual basis, with a fee being paid for\nthe hire of one of the courts to play\non. However, with the new system,\nany member of staff who wishes\nto play, even if they only play once\na year, must pay the full \u00a3216 fee.\nThis also means that the staff will\npay Ethos twice; once for the hire\nof the room, and once more for the\nright to use the facilities.\nStaff upset at new\nEthos pricing\nOne member of staff who spoke to\nFelix commented: \u201cWe have always\nanticipated having to pay for use of\nthe sports centre once the free period was over.\u201d He went on to question the logic of forcing any staff\nmember who wants to use the facil-ity, even if only on a casual basis, to\npay \u00a3216, saying: \u201cIf I only swim a\nfew times a year, it is an awful lot.\u201d\nThere are also concerns how this\nwill impact members of College\nstaff who are on minimum wage.\nFelix contacted Neil Mosley, Head\nof Sport Imperial, for comment.\n\u201cWhen we looked at a suitable\ncharging policy for the new Centre one of our major objectives was\nto provide value to money to staff\nby minimizing the administrative\ncosts of collecting any fees.\nI am sure you will agree that\n\u00a318 per month for unlimited use of\na very modern gym and pool for a\nkeep fit enthusiast represents terrific value and over 400 staff have\nnow signed up as members of Club\nImperial. Having said that I recognise that the one group that have\nbeen affected are occasional swimmers.\u201d He added: \u201cwe will be looking at pool use and seeing if we can\nincorporate a scheme for occasional use. If we are able to make such a\nmove we will ensure that it is widely\npublicised.\u201d\nised so that you can start moving\nyour equipment.\u201d\nHowever, it appears Estates had\nsecond thoughts. At a meeting of\nthe esoterically named \u201cSpace Executive\u201d, College decided to allocate the basement space in Princes\nGate to the RCSU, and to give the\nwalkway room to ICT, who manage the computer systems for the\nCollege.\nThe protest was organised after pleas for the decision to be reversed fell on deaf ears. Though the\nRector, Sir Richard Sykes, was not\npresent as he is out of the country,\na number of key College officials\ncame to the windows of the Blue\nCube to wave at the protesters be-low. These included Tony Mitcheson (College Secretary), Martin\nKnight (Faculty of Natural Science\nPrincipal), and Chris Towler (who\nchaired the meeting where the decision was made). Mr Towler came\ndown later to talk to the protesters.\nThe Deputy Rector, Professor\nSir Leszek Borysiewicz, stopped\nto chat amicably with the assembled students on his way to lunch,\nthough he stopped short of signing\nthe paper petition.\nSwimmers in the Ethos swimming pool, swimming\n2 felix Friday 19 January 2007\nNEWS news.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nINVISIBLE SANDWICH\n\n"

Some of these\ncampaigns, such as last week\u02bcs RCSU O\ufb03ce protest,\nare high pro\ufb01le but many are less visible.\nOne of the things the Sabbatical team are trying to\ndo this year is raise the pro\ufb01le and e\ufb00ectiveness of\ncampaigns in general. We hope to do this by making\nsure these campaigns are well resourced, well coordinated and well supported.\nThis term will see the launch of several high pro\ufb01le\ncampaigns including \u201cGreen Week\u201d, \u201cFairtrade\nFortnight\u201d and an LGBT Awareness week, however,\nwe would like to see more campaigns on more\nissues in the future. This is why we are working\ntowards creating new dedicated campaign roles\nwithin the Union and we are looking for enthusiastic\nvolunteers to take on these roles.\nIf you are interested in getting involved in\ncampaigning and perhaps even leading a campaign,\nthen please get in touch with Ben Harris, the Union\u02bcs\nDeputy President for Education and Welfare (dpew@\nimperial.ac.uk). This year we hope to run campaigns\non the following issues:\n\u2022 Anti-Racism: campaigning for better race relations\nat Imperial.\n\u2022 Disabled students: working with the College to\nmake it more accommodating for students with\ndisabilities.\n\u2022 Environmental: campaigning for a greener\nImperial, focussing on Green Week this term.\n\u2022 Ethical: raising awareness of ethical issues\namongst Imperial students, focussing on Fairtrade\nFortnight this term.\n\u2022 LGBT: campaigning on Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and\nTransgender issues.\n\u2022 Womens\u02bc: organising events to encourage women\nto pursue a career in science, engineering and\ntechnology.\nHowever, if you want to propose your own\ncampaign, then please write to Ben or myself.

There have been many parties over the\nfestive period, you have probably all been back to\nyour hometown, met up with old friends and seen\nsome of your family for the \ufb01rst time in ages.\nChristmas can be a strange time of year, many of\nyou have probably had to buy presents for your\nfamily or perhaps some of you may have just had\na good time catching up with old friends; either of\nthese cases can be expensive.\nAs a student it can often be hard to budget for these\nthings after all you have rent to pay, fees, books\nfor education and of course need money to spend\non your leisure time, with all this in mind there is\nalways a temptation to borrow money at Christmas\nto fund your gift buying or your social life.\nThis money can be borrowed from a bank, personal\nloans, credit cards or sometimes from friends but\nthere is always a temptation to spend over your\nlimit at the festive time of year we call Christmas.\nOften after the last mince pie has been eaten and\nthe eggnog has \ufb01nished, the \ufb01rst credit card bill\narrives or your bank is on at you because you are\nover your overdraft.\nThe Information and Advice Centre may be able\nto help if you have over spent your budget at\nChristmas and now \ufb01nd yourself in a bad \ufb01nancial\nsituation. If you are having problems with credit\ncard companies or your bank, we can work out your\nincome and outgoings and write to these companies\non your behalf to negotiate a payment plan that you\ncan actually a\ufb00ord; we can advocate for you in this\nsituation.\nIt is also important that you prioritise your money\nin this situation, something like a credit card debt is\nnot essentially a priority debt. It is best that you look\nto pay things such as your rent, amenity bills and\nfees before looking at other debts, this is because if\nyou don\u02bct pay these things you will essentially lose\nsomething. For example if you don\u02bct pay your rent\nyou will be evicted, don\u02bct pay gas bill, you will be\ncut o\ufb00 and if you don\u02bct pay your fees you may be\nasked to leave college.\nWe can also help if you \ufb01nd you can\u02bct a\ufb00ord your\nfees or rent to the college. We write to the college\non behalf of many students and try to explain why\nyou can\u02bct a\ufb00ord these debts and also sometimes\nmake o\ufb00ers to them to negotiate a payment plan.\nIf you \ufb01nd yourself in heavy debt, it is important\nto tell people what is happening and not bury your\nhead in the sand. Most companies are willing to\nhelp if you \ufb01nd you cannot a\ufb00ord to pay them back\nthe money you owe them.\nOf course debt isn\u02bct just about the money, it can\nbring on other issues such as stress and worry.\nThese of course, can lead to you not being focused\non your academic work. It is important to talk\nto someone if you feel that the stress of debt is\na\ufb00ecting your work.\nYour \ufb01rst port of call\nshould be your personal\ntutor. If you \ufb01nd that they\nare not helpful or you don\u02bct\nfeel comfortable talking to\nthem, then the Information\nand Sdvice Centre can talk\nto your department for\nyou and explain what is\nhappening. We can try to\nnegotiate more time for\nyou to do your projects or at least let them know\nhow you are feeling leading up to an exam.\nThe college o\ufb00ers \ufb01nancial help in the form of the\naccess to learning fund. This is administered by\nthe student \ufb01nance o\ufb03ce and is for students who\nhave exhausted all other areas of income, not all\nstudents will be eligible for this. The Student Support\nO\ufb03cer, Phillipa Worley, administers this; you can\ncontact her on : student.support @imperial.ac.uk.\nThe Information and Advice Centre also has some\napplication forms for this fund.\nThe Information and Advice Centre also gives\ngeneral budgeting advice to students with regard\nto how to manage your money more e\ufb00ectively.

It was due to innovative\nsewing techniques developed for\nmilitary wear that the art of tailoring arose.\nDuring the late middle ages,\nsumptuary laws were established,\nrestricting fashion according to social status. Sumptuary laws existed\nnot only in England, but around the\nworld, in countries such as Italy, Japan and France. In England it was\nstipulated that only certain individuals were allowed to wear specific\ncolours and types of clothing. These\nlaws were used by the nobility to\noppress the growing bourgeoisie in\nmedieval cities.\nDuring the 18th century, the\nlandscape of menswear was unequivocally altered by the enlighten-ment. Puritanism advocated plain\nwear, and no form of ostentatious\nor gaudy display. Perhaps it was\nonly under this extreme cultural\nlandscape that dandyism could\nemerge. Dandies placed enormous\nemphasis on physical appearance\nand clothing. Charles Baudelaire\ndefined the dandy as one who elevates aesthetics to a living religion.\n\"These beings have no other status,\nbut that of cultivating the idea of\nbeauty in their own persons, of satisfying their passions, of feeling and\nthinking ... \"\nAround this period fashion was\nalso taken to the extreme with\nMacaronis \u2013 a name derived from\nyoung men who had picked up the\nvernacular of referring to anything\nfashionable as \"very macaroni\" after travelling to Italy for the Grand\nTour. The Macaronis dressed in\nhigh fashion with stripes and tall,\npowdered wigs with a little hat on\ntop. Macaronis were very exaggerated in terms of dress, their\nmanner of speaking, and gambling\nexcessively. They were also very ef-feminate, and were seen as being\ndevoid of 'traditional' values of mas-culinity, and soon 'Macaroni' came\nto be used as an insult.\nWhereas in the 18th century, dress\nwas important to distinguish social\nrank, in the 19th century aristocratic leadership was breaking down,\nand egalitarianism was increasing.\nThe suit became a symbolic social\nleveller; there was less distinction\ndrawn between social ranks. It also\nmarked a departure from the effeminate fashion-directioned mode\nof dress the Macaronis embraced.\nMenswear catwalks have never\nhad much credibility, and have\nacted as a side note to their female\nequivalent.\nHowever, recently menswear labels have been getting more media\ncoverage, with more male fashion\nspreads and magazines dedicated\nto men's style. It's strange that wo-menswear has dominated the spotlight for a long time, when you think\nback to the early 18th century when\ndandyism was sweeping across\nthe nation. When did the culture of\nmenswear change so much that society deemed it effeminate to have\nan interest in fashion?\nIn the past, fashion was an important signal of a man's status in so-ciety. Military uniform was the biggest influence on menswear in the\n17th century, and was used to assert\nauthority, and also imply the virility\nof its wearer. Military wear, such as\nAs mass-media proliferated in\nthe 20th century, menswear became more defined by popular cul-ture. People aspired to the style of\niconic stars like Humphrey Bogart,\nJames Dean, and Fred Astaire.\nNow, advertising is spreading further into people's lives, and increasingly influencing men to be as body-conscious as women. This increase\nin advertising has some negative\ncultural effects: male cases of\nanorexia and muscle dysmorphia\nare on the increase. The spread of\nmass-media has also meant that\npeople can now be inspired by global culture. This is the age of the individual in the West; style is formed\nby personal philosophies, and not\nso affected by cultural constraints.\nThe increase in high-street stores\ncatering to men mean that fashion\nis now just as accessible for men as\nit is for women.\nVictor & Rolf Etro\nMacaroni 'style'\nDandies\nJames Dean\nJ.

    "content": "Why set up the Club?\nOne small step for Imperial College, London, an impressive shimmy for the Belly Dancing Club!\nAsha Ashokan and Millie Dutt (both\nfifth year medics) were keen to take\nup classes in the formally known\n\u2018Raqs Sharqi\u2019 or oriental dance,\nwhich is practised with many different styles in various parts of the\nMiddle East; Egypt, Lebanon, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Iraq, and\nMorocco, to name but a few.\nWe were interested to learn\nthis very special artform\nlocally, with friends and staff from\nacross the University, and at an affordable price, thus taking advantage of Imperial\u2019s encouragement\nfor the set-up of diverse recreational clubs and societies.\nPerhaps it was the spellbinding\ncontrol and graceful elegance that\ndancers have while performing intricate hip movements and muscle\nisolations to music which mesmer-ised us, maybe it was pure fascination with the exotic glamour of the\nfinely embroidered costumes, veils,\nzills (cymbals) and other accessories that, when worn, instantly\nbring about the urge to celebrate\npassion, creativity, and the small\nrecognised beauty that is being a\nfine woman in our prestigious University that is heaving with male\nstudents in a competitive, hard-working, and undeniably stressful environment! Together with\nthe support and dedication of Nabigha Mohyud-Din (Secretary) and\nKamaljeet Samra (Treasurer), they\nset up the now blossoming ICU Belly Dancing Club.\nThe background to bellydancing\nEarliest forms of the dance\nmay havehad aspiritualorreligious\ncontext although it is generally believed to have roots in Middle Eastern fertility ceremonies, a dance\nperformed for women by women to\nstrengthen the abdominal muscles\nfor the act of childbirth and also a\ncustom at many weddings. The art\nof belly dancing is still traditionally passed down from generation to\ngeneration in some families simply\nas rich female heritage.\nThe separate styles of the dance\nrange from the highly skilled and refined Egyptian cabaret style, where\ndancers are trained to execute\nthose wonderfully slight muscle\nmovements which we most often associate with the term \u201cbelly\ndance,\u201d or dramatic Lebanese cabaret with its dramatic and ballet in-fluences, to softly refined classical\noriental dance which emerged from\nthe courts of the early Ottoman\nEmpire; from modestly dressed\nBaladi (or folkloric dance) of rural\nEgypt which also encompasses the\nmale Tahtib martial arts dance, the\ngypsy style Ghawazee, to the Khaleeji of the Persian Gulf States and\nSaudi Arabia with its distinctive\nhair toss. And many more styles do\nexist, not forgetting Turkish style\ncabaret with it\u2019s flamboyant, earthy\nmovements and, some may say, seductive overtones.\nWith its introduction into global\nmedia notably it is thought in the\n19th century, the term \u2018belly dance\u2019\nbecame inextricably linked with\nsexual glamour and took on alternative meanings which were slightly demeaning to the soulful beauty\nof the danceform.\nHowever, having travelled afar\nand become a worldwide, constantly evolving phenomenon,\nthe distinct cultural traditions of\nbelly dancing and its joyful expression are still largely retained\nand respected; it continues to appeal to the human spirit, and it is\nalso fun, excellent muscle-toning\nexercise, and a great way of making\nnew friends!\nIt has recently gained much\npopularity amongst us younger\ngenerations via mainstream music\nvideos such as those of Shakira or\nBeyonce, its image enduring for the\nmost part as a positive testimony to\nbeauty, strength, and grace, and all\nthings feminine.\nWhat we do\nThe ICU Belly Dancing Club aims\nto make this fantastically strong\nartform accessible to all Imperial College students (including our\nmen, provided there is sufficient\ninterest!), from every department,\nbackground, or level of dancing\n- and no experience is needed!\nWe already have superb, highly\nexperienced teachers and performers for our club and a Beginners\ncourseisrunningsuccessfullyinthe\nReynolds, Hammersmith, for which\nthere has been the highest demand\nsince our set-up in late November.\nOver the first couple of lessons we\nhave already been covering isolated\nupper and lower body movements,\narm movements, hip drops, a fluidly\nelegant move known as \u2018the camel\u2019,\nclassic shimmies, back bends, and\nmore, with our lovely dance teacher Saffron! This month on 25th\nJanuary, ICU Belly Dancing will\nbe starting brand new classes in\nRoom 343, Huxley Building, South\nKensington, to cater for the overwhelming demand for extra classes\nacross the college.\nWe have been fortunate in securing a particularly well-known dancer these classes; Krystina (Chris\nGould), who has trained impressively in all types of Egyptian style\nBelly Dance and has many years of\nteaching experience for which she\nhas achieved distinctions with the\nprestigious Josephine Wise Academy of Arabic Dance. Her training in\nCairo with first-class professional\ndancers and choreographers has\nculminated in her becoming a truly\nstunning dancer of our times, and\nshe will no doubt be able to give our\nstudents an insight into the real essence of the dance.\nShe has performed with the fabulous dance company Massriat at\nseveralshows,whichthoseinterest-ed in the danceform may well have\nseen performing, she holds regular\nclasses, workshops and also has\nher very own dance company that\nperform with her at public events,\nincluding the superb Fantasia\nevents in London. With her unique\nblend of experience and traditional\ndancing style, this course is going to be very special and unmissable for all Imperial students and a\nparticular delight for those with an\ninterest in future performance and\nchoreography!\nHow to get involved\nOne course of 12 lessons, taking us\nup to early May, will be available\nat the unbeatable price of \u00a329.00\nonly for club members, which can\nbe found nowhere else in London,\nwhile membership costs the standard Imperial College Union rate of\n\u00a33 for this year 2006-7.

It was\ncalled \u201cWarbug: Ants of Destiny\u201d, partly because subtitles\nwere in fashion at the time,\nbut mostly because I was\nnine and it sounded right. It was\na sizzling blend of Command and\nConquer and SimAnt, with a twist\nof primary school humour and the\nkind of plot that a straight-to-Dis-ney-Channel movie would be proud\nof. One day, I promised myself, that\ngame would get made.\nA decade on, and I\u2019ve still not\nhad use for my promotional clock\ndesigns (with clockwork thorax\naction!tm\n). In fact, I\u2019m beginning\nto wonder whether I ever will, not\nleast because the market for insect-based isometric strategy games is\nsmaller than I thought, but also because the games industry can seem\npretty daunting for One Man and\nHis Keyboard.\nThe picture does generally seem\nto be a dark one \u2013 production costs\nare soaring, and demand for complex graphical systems is huge.

That\u2019s the message\nthat\u2019s been given by a collection\nof supporters and success stories\nfrom the Indie scene, in a series\nof internet addresses under the\ntitle \u201cSo You Want To Be An Indie\nDeveloper?\u201d\nThe posts ranged from the lighthearted to the serious, all of them\noffering tips and advice on breaking\ninto a competitive, yet rewarding\nindustry. One of the contributors\nWould.You.Like.To.Make.A.Game?\nMichael Cook asks if it\u2019s too late to break into indie game development and Introversion answer\nSimplicity In Blue \u2013 Introversion\u2019s post-apocalyptic strategy game DEFCON is their third game and an example of their pure design philosophy. It\u2019s also unsettlingly foreboding\nto the group was Introversion, the\nself-titled \u201clast of the bedroom coders\u201d, and acclaimed breakthrough\ncoders of Uplink, Darwinia and\nDEFCON.\n\u201cPublishers often have a cookie\ncutter approach to making game\n... so no wonder we end up with\nhundreds of identical first-person\nshooters.\u201d explains Tom Arundel\nin a news post on their website,\n\u201cThat\u2019s where the independent\nsteps in.\u201d\nIt\u2019s true that good design isn\u2019t\nsomething that money makes\neasier \u2013 and talent in that respect\nwill always play well with gamers.\n\u201cKeep it simple.\u201d Tom says, \u201cDon\u2019t\nfeel you have to compete with the\nbigger developers ... in photore-alistic graphics and physics, you\ncan\u2019t.\u201d\nIntroversion\u2019s latest work, DEFCON, is a testament to simple\ndesign, and it\u2019s this cut-down, atmospheric feel that won over the\ngaming world again. Tom spoke to\nFelix about Introversion\u2019s rise to\nfame, and the reality of the future of\nIndie development.\nTowards the end of Tom\u2019s post in\nthe \u201cIndie Developer\u201d news piece,\nhe mentions the freedom given by\nindependent development. But the\nlast piece of advice is perhaps the\nmost important \u2013 \u201cthe only way\nyou\u2019ll ever be able to make the\ngames milling around in your head,\nis by becoming an indie developer.\u201d\nWhether you\u2019re optimistic about\nthe future, or don\u2019t think you\u2019d have\na chance, the only way to find out\nis to get out there and start coding,\nand there\u2019s no time like the present.\nBut don\u2019t think you can take Warbug\naway from me. We\u2019re going places.\nOnwards to the interview:\nThe original team has been together for almost ten years now.\nWhat was the defining moment in\nthe rise of Introversion?\nI think without a doubt, winning\nthree awards at this year\u2019s Independent Games Festival for Darwinia was the biggest highlight\nyet for Introversion. We had really\nstruggled during the development\nof Darwinia, the project over-ran by\nover a year, so financially we weren\u2019t\nin great shape, and morale was also\nrunning pretty low in the company\nby this point. Those awards finally\nmade all the blood, sweat and tears\nseem worth it and it\u2019s amazing how\nmuch that event has positively redefined this year for us. We gained\nan enormous amount of exposure\nand credibility off the back of those\nawards and opportunities are popping up even now which I think are\nas a direct result of IGF.\nWhere did you find you struggled\nmost? Did the biggest challenges\nlie with competing in terms of\nmanpower or technology, or was\nthe difficulty more in terms of getting noticed, getting seen?\nTo be honest, I think really a mixture of both. There are massive\nlogistical issues to solve when you\nset up a computer games company in terms of financing and obtaining enough resources to get\nstarted. Generally speaking, one\nof the biggest issues is you don\u2019t\nhave the time or the manpower to\nattempt certain types of games. It\nalso means we struggle to produce\ncontent; for example a number of\nreviews said that Darwinia was too\nshort but it had taken us 3 years to\nproduce a game with 10 levels!\nThe second major issue is that\npublishers aren\u2019t really interested\n\u2013 that\u2019s the bottom line and it can\nbe a real struggle to get yourselves\nnoticed and taken seriously. When\nDarwinia released, we were big\nenough to self publish in the UK,\nbut the US market is around ten\ntimes larger and we just didn\u2019t have\nthe staff. It took a success story like\nthe Darwinia launch on Steam and\nwinning at IGF for publishers to\n16 felix Friday 19 January 2007\nGAMES games.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nSpeaks for itself really, doesn\u2019t it?\n\n"

    "content": "GolfSoc tee off in Surrey\npages 22 & 23\nCROSSWORD\nSUDOKU\nport\nS\nWhat a way to spend your Sundays,\nbut to escape the stresses of College for a relaxing day in the country dedicated to the splendid pastime that is golf.\nRecently, a small group of members attempted a trip south of the\nriver to a golf club in Surrey. Not\nknowing exactly where the club\nwas, our designated driver (VC\nSimon) utilized his latest gadget,\nGPS, to guide us directly to the\nclub. Problem is these devices are\nonly as good as the idiot who programs them, and there are in fact\n2 Meadow\nRoads in Surrey one of which was\na lot further away from where we\nwanted to be. Guess which one we\nwent to?! So after nearly an hour\nsitting in traffic (much enjoyed by\nthe boys in the back seat with three\ngolf bags sitting on there laps) we\nhad missed our tee\u2013off time and\ndecided to descend on the first golf\nclub we found.\nSo more by luck than Judgment\nwe found South Surrey Golf Course,\nand things got better when it turned\nout to be cheaper than the one we\nwere heading for originally. After a\nwarm up of walking to the first tee,\nthe game began. Clearly everyone\nwas still traumatized from the journey as not a single player hit the\ngreen on the first shot of the par\nthree and Simon even lost his ball.\nThe game pretty much developed\ninto the disappearing ball game,\nwith Danny losing his ball and then\nhis temper on the second. Oli Managed to keep them pretty much between the trees unlike my consistent slicing which baffled everyone.\nThe Longer holes proved opportunity enough for Simon to hit some\nsmashing drives, if only he was as\nfast up the hill as his ball was.

For those members with\nlittle or no previous experience in\ngolf, there is an ambitious beginner\u2019s programme that will last\nfor 8 weeks throughout the spring\nterm. It will teach the basics, from\nholding the club correctly, right the\nway through to effective course\nmanagement.\nGolf Soc. isn\u2019t just for novices, but\nexperienced golfers too. The Tiger\nWoods among you will have the opportunity to hone your skills on the\ndriving range before attempting\nnumerous courses in and around\nLondon.\nThere is a number of golf related\nsocial events, for example Pub Golf,\nwhich is always a popular amongst\nnon-golfers as well, Student alumni\ngolf matches and the infamous\n106th Bottle Match, which is due to\ngo ahead in February. Golf Soc. is\nfor anyone at Imperial with a keen\ninterest in the game of golf. Your\nability in this sport is not an excuse\nto shy away from joining!

I\u2019m going to\nfocus mainly on the bastard that is\nKen purely because I feel that by\nnow most people know Tony Blair\nis a downright fool but some ignoramuses have mixed opinions on Ken\nwhereby some think he\u2019s a legend.\nand it needs to be homed into your\nheads why this man is such a tool.\nKen has no fucking clue what he is\ndoing\u2026first of all, his sense of identity is totally fucked up and lacking (like his hair and good looks)\nHe claims he is \u201cmoderate\u201d (in my\nopinion he is more of an extreme\nsocialist bordering on communist)\nbut he does the stupid thing of coyly\nraising the price of public transport\nto such an extent that sometimes\nyou think he is trying to screw the\nlast shred of money out of all those\npoor souls who are far from well off.\nWhat the fuck is he doing? Seriously, \u00a34 for a single journey is ridicu-lous. Is he having a laugh?\nObviously the little twat is fucking\nhappy to do this because he doesn\u2019t\nsuffer. Of course not, the cheeky\nfucker ponces around and flounces\nhis fat arse about at the taxpayers\nIn the past few years the Mayor of London has stood accused of making racist remarks, and is a polarising\nfigure in London politics. Kat Fu vents her spleen on the subject of transport, politics, and traffic wardens\nexpense so blatantly he\u2019s not going to complain. I\u2019d love to see the\nday he gets a normal oyster card,\ntops it up with \u00a320 (which to some\nof us, namely students, unwealthy\npeople, stingy rich people, is a LOT\nof money) and see it get used up\nwithin a few days. Yes I\u2019d love to\nsee his face if that day ever came,\nhis tiny slitty eyes screwing up and\nbecoming even smaller than they\nalready are if that is even possible?\nI\u2019m imagining it to myself now (its\nnot a pretty sight so actually, I\u2019d\nrather not see his face). I\u2019d rather\nhe just do everyone a big favour and\nlower the fucking prices of public\ntransport which I feel cant really be\ndeemed public anymore because\nthere are fuck loads of citizens who\nfind themselves unable to pay for\nthe extreme and extortionate cost.\nTotally going off on one here, but\nif you have a sneaky little peak at\npictures of Ken, you can see that he\nhas progressively gone from skinny to a little chubby to now full on\nlardy. In my opinion this is due not\nonly to the fact that he is so fucking\nsmug that he can pass any law and\nget away with it, but also his incredible ability to sponge off all the free\nfood and alcohol that he gets during\nmeetings. Labour is so fucking sly.\nThey claim to be all eco friendly but\nhow seriously can we take all this\nI\nn this society of multiculturalism and globalization, what\nwill become the meaning of\nnationality, what is the im-portance? And to what extent\ndoes it define us and your life?\nThese questions arose to me\nwhen I was browsing to through the\nnews from websites back home. As\nmost of you probably don\u2019t know, the\nmayoral elections are taking place\nin Taiwan, and as all of you know, as\nall elections go, that is a time for political opponents to diss each other\nby any conceivable means. Despite\nthe increase in constructive policy\ndebates, and city plans, candidates\nin this new democracy still find it\nirresistible to reveal other candidates\u2019 dirty laundry.\nI\u2019ve seen them all. And I am glad\nthattacticssuchasmedicalrecords,\nunfulfilled military obligation of\ncandidate\u2019s children, tax avoidance\nto mistresses, don\u2019t effect the public decision anymore; a good indication of the development of the public resistance to stupid attacks (a\nmayor with cancer can still govern\nwell, you know!) However, a recent\ndevelopment has truly shocked me:\nthe nationality of not the candidate,\nbut the child and grandchild of the\ncandidate.\nI find it stupid that people are\nconcerned whether the mayor\u2019s\ndaughter renounces her American\nnationality, I find it disgusting that\npressure is place upon the President\u2019s daughter in law to give birth\non Taiwanese soil (she\u2019s studying\nin the US at the moment), and I\ndon\u2019t understand why the previous\nPremier had to recall his son form\na foreign country, resulting in him\nabandoning his lifestyle and perhaps career or education, to win the\nsupport of the public.\nAnd I ask, why do people care?\nDoes the fact that I\u2019m living in London, make my father a less capable\nperson to run for office? Or the fact\nthat our President is a grandpa of\nan American makes him less re-liable? I am truly baffled at this.\nCan\u2019t people see that Sonia Gandhi,\nalbeit being Italian to the bone, is\nparticipating in India\u2019s National\nCongress?

    "content": "Get fit and socialise with Pilates\nPilates is more than just exercise!\nIt is a sport that increases the\nstrength of your inner core muscles\nand helps balance and stability. It\nalso helps with easing some of those\naches and pains caused by under\nor over-use of muscles. If Pilates\nis practised regularly a number of\nbenefits can be found in the body including increased lung capacity and\ncirculation, strength and flexibility,\nparticularly the abdomen and back\nmuscles, and muscular/mental co-ordination. Bone density and the\nhealth of bones can also improve,\nand many experience positive body\nawareness for the first time. Pilates\nteaches balance and control of the\nbody, and that capacity spills over\ninto other areas of one\u2019s life.\nWhy was ICMSU Pilates set up?\nPilates has become increasingly\npopular over the years as many\nsports-professionals and recreational enthusisats reap the rewards\nfrom practising pilates regularly.\nDue to the popularity, pilates is\nbecoming increasingly expensive\nto attend sessions. Therefore, we\nwanted to set up cheap pilates\nsessions with a qualified Pilates\ninstructor and to have the classes\nin the evenings, so it is more beneficial for students who are not on\ncampus during the lunchtimes or\nare on different campuses. ICMSU\npilates welcomes all Imperial students to attend!\nCommittee members\nThe society was set up by Rebecca\nLlewellyn. Deputy-President is\nRavneet Sirha, Secretary - Luxme\nNadarajah and Treasurer is Nishanthy Ranganathan. (All 5th year\nMedics).\nTime and Venue\nMusic Room in the Reynolds every\nWednesday at 6.45pm. If there is\nmore demand for pilates, a 2nd\nclass will be organised so please\nget in contact!\nHow to join Pilates\nYou first need to get onto the mailing list! Email the Deputy President ravneet.sirha@ic.ac.uk and\nyou will be added!. Attendance to\nclasses will be as follows AND you\ncan either:\n1. Respond to the weekly email of\nattendance, and if you are the 1st\n16 who reply you will be able to at-tend. Once confirmed, attendance\nis mandatory as you will be taking\nsomeone else\u2019s place\n2. Buy attendance tickets in advance via www.union.ic.ac.uk in the\npilates section.

The club shall be acquiring\na few sets of backgammon and we\nshould ideally be holding bi-weekly,\nif not weekly meetings for people to\nhave a few games and have a bit of\nbanter etc.\nBackgammon is a great game of\nprobability, strategy and skills. It\nhas very simple rules that anyone\ncan learn within 5 minutes and\nalso offer a chance for them to beat\nan experienced player in a one off\ngame as the game depends partly\non the roll of the dice. It is particularly suitable for the largely numerically competent students of Imperial College.\nThe main aim for the rest of the\nyear is to find a core set of members and perhaps someone who is\nwilling to take it on for next year.\nPeople can sign up through the\nunion website for a nominal fee of\n\u00a31.

I was neither misquoted,\nnor my words taken out of context,\nthey were merely misjudged and\ndelivered in a \u2018moment of madness\u2019. Referring to Mr Eric Lai as\n\u2018small minded\u2019 was unjustified and\nunfair and I would like to apologise\nto him for this statement. Eric has\ngiven many hours of his time up\nover the last two years in service to\nthe ACC, and I for one appreciate\nthis sacrifice.\nLuke Taylor\nACC Chair\nLuke is very, very\nsorry; he won\u2019t\ndo it again\nDear Editor,\nI write to you to express my disgust\nat the uninterrupted Islamophobic\nbigotry on display of late in the pages of your \u2018newspaper.\u2019\nHaving been forced to endure the\nracist, xenophobic ravings of Sam\nLynas in the weeks leading up to\nthe end of last term, we are now\npresented with a series of \u2018revelations\u2019 about the supposed malfeasance of Shama Rahman, the current DGPS.\nAre we seriously expected to believe that her being a Muslim was\nnot a causal factor in your decision\nto make this front-page news? It is\nhard to see what other reason there\ncould have been to create such a\nstorm in a teacup.\nMuslims are already under siege\nin this country, and giving prominence to such trivial claims on such\nbigoted grounds can only serve to\nheighten the feelings of alienation\nSam Lynas is\nback, yes he is\nAndy Sykes replies,\nHahahahahahahahaha. HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA.\nHAHAHA. Hah. Hahaha.\nDear Editor,\nRe: Felix (issue no. 1368) front page\narticle regarding Deputy President\nGraduate Students, Miss Shama\nRahman.\nAfter reading the above article we\nwere shocked and concerned by the\nserious nature of the allegations directed against Miss Rahman. Having worked alongside and under\nthe direction of Miss Rahman, we\nfelt compelled to highlight the positive contribution she has made and\ncontinues to make to the Graduate\nstudent body, specifically through\nher role as Deputy President for\nGraduate Students.\nThroughout all the Graduate Student Association activities meetings that have been held, Miss Rahman has been highly motivated and\nwell organised, despite lacking in\nsupport from many departments in\nthe university.\nMiss Rahman has been able to\ndeal with welfare issues of PhD\nstudents in an efficient and effective manner (in particular, a serious case that developed between\nstudent and supervisor, where she\nacted professionally and provided\nsound and reasoned advice)\nThe \u2018Three Colleges\u2019 night was an\nexcellent event and a much needed\nattempt to encourage integration\nbetween student groups that rarely\nget the opportunity to mix. A great\ndeal of positive feedback was received from the two other colleges.\nThe Graduate Christmas Ball\nwas a great event and catered to\nthe graduate community specifi-cally. The change in venue proved\nto be a beneficial factor making the\nnight more enjoyable for all of those\nwho attended.\nGiven the seriousness of these allegations it is quite extraordinary\nthat they have been carelessly allowed to leak into the public domain before a fair and impartial\nhearing. These issues should have\nbeen more appropriately rectified\nin private and instead, have been\npublicly aired with no chance for\nrefute. Most important, some of\nthese claims do not relate her ability to perform her job as a sabbatical officer.\nIn our opinion, Miss Rahman has\ndone an excellent job to date and\nis organised, exuberant and well\nmotivated. This success is particularly impressive considering that\nthis sabbatical post is in its infancy,\nwith little historical guidelines or\nprotocol to follow. It is also important to acknowledge that graduate\nstudents are an inherently difficult\nbody of students to represent, given\nthe diverse nature of their work and\ndispersal throughout the campuses\nof Imperial. We have observed that\nMiss Rahman has tried her utmost\nto ensure that all graduate students\nare equally represented.\nWithout hesitation, we believe\nMiss Rahman has made and should\nbe allowed to continue to make, a\nvery valuable contribution to the\nlives of graduate students at Imperial. It is hard to imagine a better\ncandidate for this position given\nthe circumstances. We strongly\nurge DPFS Jon Matthews to rethink proposing the no-confidence\nmotion and Council not to pass the\nmotion if it is put before them. We\nalso strongly believe her removal\nwould be detrimental to the representation of the graduate student\ncommunity.\nKind regards,\nAidan Roche,\nPhD Representative,\nDepartment of Bioengineering\nLin Mei,\nResearch Postgraduate,\nFaculty of Medicine, S.O.R.A.\nDominic Southgate,\nPhD Representative\nDepartment of Bioengineering\nTushar Singhania,\nTaught Postgraduate,\nBusiness School\nAlison Williams,\nPhD Representative,\nNational Heart and Lung Institute\nPaul Wobkenberg,\nPhD Representative,\nDepartment of Physics\nthey currently experience. Shame\non you and your filthy rag! We will\nall suffer the terrible repercussions\nyour activities are sure to have on\ninter-community relations in this\ncountry.\nI remain, sir, your obedient\nservant.\nSam Lynas\nNotorious Troublemaker\nAndy Sykes replies,\nThanks for taking the time to write\na letter. I\u2019m currently subject to a\ncomplaint, so I must keep my comments as neutral as possible.\nAs for the leaking of the docu-ment, I\u2019m afraid I cannot reveal\nwhere I got my source from, nor\nshould you expect me to. A newspaper has the right to protect its\nsources..\nFor the record, a motion of no confidence is made public at the time\nit is submitted to Council, so these\nallegations would have entered the\npublic domain at that time. If another elected officer feels strongly\nenough to submit a motion of no\nconfidence, then this is news, and\nthe allegations should be reported.\nI\u2019ll say no more this week. Shama\nhas agreed to write a letter next\nweek detailing her complaint, and\nI shall respond to it in full. This\nshould provide her a chance to refute the allegations publically.\nI hope that\u2019s satisfactory.\n5\nfelix\nFriday 19 January 2007\n\n"

    "content": "I, Gamer\nI\n\u2019m certain now that a\ngame can be made out\nof anything. Not because\nwe\u2019re seeing kooky lawyer simulators or rhythm\naction games that wouldn\u2019t look\nout of place in the Tate Modern.\nIt was actually a very simple\ngame called Kudos, with a very\ncurious objective.\nI\u2019d heard about Kudos a while\nago, when it was celebrated as\nevidence that Indie-developed\ngames were the future. Like\nmany games, you play a man in\nhis twenties, ready to fight for\nhis future. Unlike other games,\nyou play an underpaid waiter\nfrom Slough. And no, Slough\ndoesn\u2019t turn out to be a base\nof operations for an international ring of robot-army-mak-ers. Slough turns out to be full\nof low-paying jobs, and brown.\nYour aim? To rise in popularity\nas far as you can by the age of\nthirty.\nEventhoughKudosisaclever\ngame, and a depressingly good\nsimulation of how to live your\nlife, right down to the way you\ngain popularity, the game\u2019s not\nalways enjoyable. It\u2019s the kind\nof game you\u2019d tell other people\nabout rather than actually play\nyourself. As you can see.\nBut the media were right\nwhen they celebrated Kudos,\nbecause good game or not, Kudos does show why Independent games are needed. Sure\nthey\u2019ll create the genius steps\nthat birth new genres. And as\nwe\u2019re told by Introversion this\nweek, it\u2019s a tough fight. But\nmore importantly than good\ngames, Indie gaming gets us\ntalking about games.\nA trailer for the new expos\u00e9\nfilm on violence in videogames,\n\u201cMoral Combat\u201d (sic) shows\nalmost nothing but the usual\nstereotypes \u2013 Lara Croft, cars\ncrashing, and \u2013 okay, a little\nobscurely \u2013 Abe from the Oddworld series. The reason for all\nof this is that, no matter how\ninteresting and diverse the\nshelves in Game look to us, to\nthe mainstream media it still\nall condenses down to the same\nthings \u2013 sex, violence, violent\nsex and sexual violence.\nIndie gaming rises above a\nlot of that.

Admittance is free,\nand they\u2019re even sorting out the\nwired and wireless magic for you.\nIf you fancy some Warcraft III :\nFrozen Throne DotA or the ever-popular Counterstrike 1.6. then\nsimply bring your laptop or desktop\nalong to the Union Dining Hall between 10am and 4pm. Early admissions are promised drinks! Manlove\noptional, not guaranteed.\nSurely even the most ardent Microsoft fanboys must at last feel\nsympathy for Sony, as this week\nthey were forced to make yet more\nembarassing announcements and\napologies. As if cocking up almost\nevery stage of the PS3\u2019s development cycle wasn\u2019t enough, this\nweek say Sony apologising after reports of an Emmy win for the PS3\u2019s\nSixaxis controller proved false.\nIt all seemed too good to be true.\nThe Sixaxis had allegedly won an\ninnovation award for it\u2019s tilt-mo-tion technology, despite the Wiimote have very similar \u2013 if not far\nbetter \u2013 capabilities. This sparked\nthe predictable ranting on blogs\nand forums the internet over, until\nSony admitted that someone had\nmisunderstood \u2013 the Playstation 2\ncontroller was receiving the award,\nand they\u2019d reported it wrong. Oh,\nSony.\nOther than that it\u2019s been a week\nof smiles for the Industry, including Sony who reported that the\nChristmas big-seller was not in\nfact the XBox 360, but their original\nPlaystation2. Elsewhere, financial\nreports are showing healthy sales\nand growth during 2006 in almost\nevery aspect of the gaming indus-try. America hit $12.5billion, Japan\nsaw \u00a5600billion (around $5billion)\n\u2013 it all bodes well for a 2007 where\nconsoles sales are only just beginning to pick up again.\nUnless you\u2019re a Wii owner, of\ncourse.

The most disturbing so far\ninvolves the death of a woman from\n\u201cwater intoxication\u201d after entering\na contest on an American radio station entitled \u201cHold Your Wee For\nA Wii\u201d. It seems like puns can kill,\nafter all.\nAnd if there\u2019s one aspect of the\nindustry feeling a financial squeeze\nat the moment, then it\u2019s probably\nthe media. Sales certainly weren\u2019t\nup at the offices of Ziff Davis, leading to the sale of 1Up, the renowned\ngaming site, as well as the once-monoloithic Electronic Gaming\nMonthly, a magazine that once\ncommanded huge sales both in the\nUS and abroad. The Official Playstation2 Magazine closes its doors\nthis month earlier than was ex-scores.\nThereleaseschedulecouldn\u2019tlook\nquieter this week, with only a yelp\nfrom Tennis Masters coming to the\nDS, possibly hoping to take advantage of an otherwise quiet week for\ngaming in general. Gamers seem to\nnot mind very much, though, with\nBurning Crusade occupying the top\nslot in the game charts.\nLastly \u2013 if you haven\u2019t bought a\nDS yet, Japan thinks you\u2019re missing out. Famitsu\u2019s list of the 100\ntop-selling games of the year shows\nthat fifteen of the top twenty games\nwere on the Nintendo handheld,\nwith Pokemon Diamond holding\nthe top spot with over 4.3million\nunits sold.\nThat said, the rumour mills have\nyet to be stopped talking about the\nnext PSP\n.

    "content": "Thailand\u2019s time of turmoil\nOver a century ago, the Siam regime based in Bangkok annexed\nthe southern provinces of what is\nknown today as Thailand. It has\nsince been under their administra-tion, but violence still erupts amidst\nthe jungle, palm trees and sandy\nbeaches, as unhappy Islamic insurgents battle for independence from\nthe predominately Buddhist state.\nIn the last three years, the conflict\nhas claimed the lives of 1,800 peo-ple, and has blanketed the region in\na thick fog of fear. There have been\nseveral instances when a villager\u2019s\nhead was removed and placed in\nclear public view, warning anyone\nelse foolish enough to open shop\non a Friday that they faced a similar fate. Of course the government\nintervened and told people not to\nfear; to open their shops on that sacred Islamic day, and to not be ter-rorised by such acts of terrorism.\nBut the situation, deaths, carnage\nand all, in Thailand\u2019s problematic\nsouth, triggered a greater political\nupheaval in the nation\u2019s capital. The\nmetaphorical scalp of billionaire\nPrimeMinisterThaksinShinawatra\nwas taken whilst holidaying in sunny England in the form of a bloodless coup. Evidentially the demos\nof the country had had enough of\npromises to wrap up the issue in\na colourful bow tie and send it off\ninto the history books, but instead\nprovoking greater troubles and letting prisoners roast to death on the\nbacks of transport lorries. Thaksin\nShinawatra was obviously to blame,\nand by September 19 2006, he was\nremoved in favour of a king-backed\nmilitary commander.\nThat is a significant issue as the\nking of Thailand is much loved and\nadmired, and what he says, generally goes. Shinawatra on the other\nhand, has been described as slimy\nand incumbent; he faced much of\nthe same ridicule as Tony Blair and\nSven Goran Eriksson did here in\nBritain. That they promised much\n- \u2018Education, education, education\u2019\nand footballing glory, but all have\nfailed dramatically. Ex education\nsecretary Ruth Kelly cannot even\nbare to send her children to a state\nschool.\nThe weekend saw another couple\nof people die in southern Thailand.\nMigrant contributions to Britain\nOnly three weeks into the new year\nand already 2007 is proving to be a\nconfusing time to be an immigrant\nin Britain. Romanians and Bulgarians were welcomed into the European Union on New Year\u2019s Day by\nthe Foreign Secretary Margaret\nBeckett who stressed the benefits\ntheir accession will bring to Britain.\nBut before the celebrations in Bucharest and Sofia could be cleaned\nup, the Home Secretary John Reid\nwas restricting the right of the new\nEU citizens to work in the UK, amid\nfears of \u201cmass migration\u201d.\nWithin a few days there were\nmore mixed messages when the\nGovernment claim that immigrants\nadd four billion pounds a year to\nthe economy was challenged by\nMigration Watch UK. The anti-im-migration think-tank analysed Government data to produce a report\nwhich concluded with the mouthful\nthat \u201cimmigrants only contribute\nfour pence per person per week to\neconomic growth\u201d, or as they put\nit more succinctly in their press\nrelease, a benefit \u201cequivalent to a\nMars bar a month\u201d.\nThey contended that previous efforts to assess the value of\nmigration had failed to consider\npopulation increase alongside the\nmeasured economic expansion.\nWith this taken into account, their\nanalysis claimed that the benefit\nTwo beheadings and one motorcycle shooting. And the discussion\non the New Year\u2019s Eve bombing\nin Bangkok itself, which also killed\n3 and injured 38, over whether or\nnot the deposed leader had a hand\nin the event, continues. Some say it\nwas an effort to discredit his succes-sors. What is clear is that Thaksin\ndenies it, and that PM Surayud says\nit was the doing of \u2018those who had\nlost power\u2019. As yet, the insurgents\nhave kept their activity within the\nregion that they demand independence for, barring the aforementioned city strike.\nThailand\u2019s image as a safe and\nfriendly tourist destination is under threat from such unwelcome\npublicity. 6% of the country\u2019s GDP\narises from the sector. There were\nno significant cancellations or drop\nin visitor numbers after the military\ntake over, but the future is again\nuncertain with continuing attacks,\nand violence moving into the city. In\ngeneral however, it\u2019s probably best\nto stay clear of the south. The rest\nof the nation; Phuket, Krabi, Chang\nMai, James Bond Island and, heck,\neven Bangkok, is as safe as houses,\nso long as national telecoms selling\nbillionaire ex Prime Ministers stay\nin Beijing.\nper head is then only marginal.\nFor migrants, the roller coast\nride continued. Two days after Migration Watch asserted they were\nof little value to anyone in Britain,\ncame a Bank of England report\nwhich claimed that immigration\nhas bought substantial economic\nbenefits to Britain. David Blanchflower, from the Bank\u2019s Monetary\nPolicy Committee, argued that\nby producing less than they consume migrants have kept inflation\nin check. Moreover, he noted that\nthere is \u201clittle evidence\u201d of immi-Li-Teck Lau\nFormer Thailand President Thaksin Shinawatra who was overthrown in a bloodless coup in 2006\nOmar Hashmi\nPolitics Editor\n4 felix Friday 19 January 2007\nPOLITICS politics.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nG\nood morning every-body.

So much for a radical\nchange of action - surely isn\u2019t that\njust going to make it worse? Cooperation with Iraq and Syria? - Na,\nthanks though. The New Vietnam\nwill continue until Iraq is secure\nand regionally placid to US Will.\nOne wonders what would happen\nif there were moves from the Iraqi\ngovernment to ally with Iran, or if\nthere was a \u201cdemocratically elected\u201d government, i.e. in free and\nfair elections, whose views the US\ngovernment despised. Would the\ninternational community and its\nleading states recognise this state?\nPerhaps not.\nThe recent demise in Somalia of\nthe Union of Islamic Courts is an\nexample where the War on Terror\nhas been used to frame foreign policies with no regard except to national interests and away from the\nperceived \u201cIslamist Threat\u201d. Ethiopian troops have virtually no credence with the people in Somalia.\nYet, security and just governance\ndo not matter where state policies\nare deemed unfit, even if it means\nthat western states help and fund\nthe brutal war-lords that are now in\ncharge of Somalia.\nI am just sick of domestic politics.\nI mean really, for how long has the\nHome office been broken? I\u2019m sure\nthat the problem is systemic, and\nthe frequency of new problems in\nreporting crime, tracking offenders\nand the immigrant population of\nBritain has been increasing for as\nlong as I can remember. Any beast\nas big as the NHS or Home Office\nhas a multitude of problems. I don\u2019t\nwant any scapegoats any more. If\nyou have the job, just do what you\nwant for two years. Go on - get\nsome kahootspa and just dictatori-ally change whatever you want. If\neach an every politician feels that\nhe is going to be unpopular if he\ndoes ANYTHING meaningful, then\nfor God\u2019s sake is anything going to\nchange?\nOf course, giving away that much\npower does undermine every tenant of democracy that there probably is.

Indeed, by\ntaking jobs that many Britons are\nreluctant to do, migrants have reduced the rate of joblessness, in\nturn allowing interest rates to stay\ndown.\nJust as it looked like the murky\nwaters of the immigration debate\nwere clearing, the consultancy firm\nCapital Economics threw in a new\nreport and some extra handfuls of\nmud. They published estimates\nthat immigration is far higher\nthan Government figures show. In\n2005 for instance, the consultancy\nclaimed that 780,000 people emigrated to Britain, against the official figure of 564,000. Accounting for\ntheir estimate of how many people\nleft, they arrive at an estimate of\n400,000 for net immigration, against\nonly 156,000 according to Government figures. If you don\u2019t know the\nnumber immigrants, how can you\neven begin to assess their economic impact?\nAmongst all these competing\nclaims about whether immigrants\u2019\nfinancial score card falls out in the\nblack or the red, the wider social\ndebates about assimilation and integration haven\u2019t stopped either.\nIndeed, 2007 is unlikely to see a\nconsensus emerge on immigration.\nEuropean and London Assembly\nelections will provide platforms\nfor anti-immigration parties such\nas UKIP and the far right BNP to\nmake their voices heard. The threat\nof the BNP actually gaining a seat in\nthe London Assembly is very real:\nunder proportional representation\nthey need little over five percent of\nthe vote to be elected.\nSo more confusing times for migrants ahead and with little consensus about their contribution to\nBritain, it seems there will be only\none certainty in this debate this\nyear: that immigration will remain\nas politically controversial as ever.\nAlexander Guite outlines the latest conundrums in the immigration debate\nThe Home Office building at 2 Marsham Street, London\n\n"

That dream of designing might not be as far off as\nyou think, if you give it a go...\nWhat now? The next steps for Indie wannabes\nsit up and take notice, which also\nprobably explains why we\u2019ve had so\nmuch exposure and coverage with\nour latest game, DEFCON.\nYou recently gave a talk about\nindependent games creation as a\nforce for the future. Is this where\ninnovation lies, in the hands of the\ndevelopers? Or is it more in the\nhands of the publishers, and their\nwillingness to take chances?\nI think innovation relies on both\nsides of the industry, a desire\namongst developers to create\nunique titles and a willingness on\nthe side of the publishers to take\nrisks by taking them on. Independents are often seen as the mavericks of the game industry because\nthey\u2019re usually braver when it\ncomes to trying something new, especially if they self-publish and own\ntheir own IPs.\nAt Introversion we don\u2019t do any\nmarket research before we create a\ngame; ideas just occur pretty ran-domly, inspired by something that\ninterests us so it\u2019s a pretty haphazard process. The trouble with\nthe industry today is that publishers have a cookie cutter approach\nto making games; they look at the\ngames already in the market, decide which ones seem to be selling particularly well and then get\na developer to make another spin-off. In this scenario, the developer\nhas very little creative control and\ngames are made purely with profits in mind so no wonder we end up\nwith hundreds of identical first-per-son shooters!\nWhat made you decide to partner\nwith Steam for the distribution of\nsome of your games? Do you think\nthis changed people\u2019s perception\nof Introversion?\nRetail wasn\u2019t really working out so\nwell for us \u2013 Darwinia was gaining\ngreat reviews but this wasn\u2019t really\ntranslating into particularly impressive sales. Part of that was perhaps\ndue to the comparative inaccessibility of Darwinia when we first released it; it was incredibly difficult\nto market because it was such a\ncomplicated game to explain.\nWe adapted it quite a lot after its\nfirst release to make it more user-friendly, changing the gesture control mechanism and making another demo which showed Darwinia\noff to its full potential. After these\nimprovements were made, we\nmanaged to get a deal with Valve to\nlaunch on Steam and prospects became significantly brighter for the\ncompany after that.\nWe sold more copies of Darwinia\nin the first 3 weeks of selling via\nSteam than we\u2019d managed in the\nwhole prior 6 month period selling\nvia retail and our online store.\nWould Steam only work for growing companies such as Introversion? Or do you see it as a platform for all levels of developers in\nthe future? Could this be the sort\nof system that gives indie development a helping hand?\nDigital distribution channels such\nas Steam are ideal for independ-ents; not only do you get a higher\nreturn on your product but you\u2019re\nalso much more likely to have your\ngame accepted for digital distribution than for retail, especially if it\u2019s\nan off-the-wall concept because the\nfinancial risks of releasing digitally\nare significantly lower. Digital distribution is also ideally suited to the\nkind of smaller titles that independents release \u2013 DEFCON was only 60\nMb so, perfect for online download.\nDo you still have hope for the future of the industry? Has it still got\nlife and invention left in it?\nI think the games industry has gone\nthrough a bit of a rough patch over\nthe past few years but there does\nseem to have been a bit of a back-lash, certainly in the press, against\nsome of the endless sequels and\nfranchises. I don\u2019t believe we would\nstill be here doing what we do if\nthere wasn\u2019t at least a market for\nthe kind of games we make and a\ndesire to try something new.\nT\nom Arundel is the Financial Director of IntroversionSoftware,and\none of the founders of\nthe development house.\nAlong with Mark Morris and Chris\nDelay, whom he met in his first year\nat Imperial College, London.\nNavigating PR, the world of independent publishing, and what happens to the finances when projects\noverrun hasn\u2019t been easy, and Introversion\u2019s balance between financial gain and creative vision has allowed them to retain all of their IPs\nto this date.\n\u201cWhen we finally got to see\nChris\u2019s game [Uplink] we realised\nit was good enough to sell; we gave\nup university beer for a couple of\nweeks, threw in \u00a3200 each and set\nup a store online.\u201d\nA bitter sacrifice, but a good one.\n17\nfelix\nFriday 19 January 2007\nGAMES games.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n\u201cPost-Genre\u201d game Darwinia.

To celebrate this\nsuccess we decided to launch 2007\nby becoming an official college so-ciety. With over 200 signatures supporting our application and many\nmore people signing up to the mailing list, 2007 looks to be an exciting\nyear.\nThe main aims of the society are\nto promote the purchase of Fairtrade Certified products and to\ncampaign for Fairtrade University\nStatus. Our activities will include\norganising Fairtrade Fortnight,\nattending Fairtrade conferences,\norganising debates and speakers\nat Imperial and the oppurtunity to\nsample numerous and varied Fairtrade products.\nFairtrade Fortnight is the 26th\nFebruary to the 9th March. This is\na national campaign endorsed by\nthe Fairtrade foundation. This year\nwe are looking to repeat last years\npopular and very successful \u2018Wine\ntasting Evening\u2019 but on a much\nlarger scale.\nAdditionally we will be running\nsampling sessions at lunchtimes\nacross campus and a \u2018Beat the\nGoalie\u2019 competition. There will be\nraffle prizes to be won, competitions to enter and lots of Fairtrade\nproducts on display. We are even\nlooking to pilot the first annual Fairtrade Bakeoff.\nOther oppurtunities to get involved in FairtradeSoc this year include the Annual Fairtrade Universities Conference in Leeds on 9th\nFebruary and the Ethical Careers\nExhibition on the 21st February.\nMembership of FairtradeSoc is\nonly \u00a33pa and can be bought online\nat www.imperialcollegeunion.org.\nYour \u00a33 will get you a free enamel\npin badge to wear with pride, discounts or free entry to our events,\nfree tea coffee and chocolate at our\nmeetings and a chance to join the\ncommittee.\nWe are currently looking for two\nor three extra committee members\nto help with publicity, web design\nand event planning.\nWith Imperial entering it\u2019s centenary year, and college announcing it supports the application for\nImperial to become a Fairtrade in-stitution, FairtradeSoc provides an\nexcellent opportunity to be involved\nin the process which is making\nchange happen at Imperial College.\nFor more information about events\nand how to get involved contact\nFairtradeSoc chair, Kirsty Patterson at kirsty.patterson@ic.ac.uk.\nICU Fairtrade society\nIC Synchro is one of the latest clubs\nto be created at Imperial. Since we\nare new, we are looking for Imperial\nstudents to join.\nWhy start synchronised\nswimming?\nWell, for starters, it is an excellent\nform of exercise. Also, it is a water\nsport so it is low impact on the joints.\nFurthermore, we are a brand new\nteam, which means that there are\nno expectations to live up to. Just\ncome, have a good time and try to\nlearn synchronised swimming! For\nthose that think it is really hard and\nthat they could never do it, that is\nfar from true. All one needs to be\nable to do is float! (btw, fat floats!)\nFlexibility, experience with water\nsports are just little extras.\nSynchronised swimming is hard\nbut no harder than any other sport.\nIt is just because it is so unconventional that the difficulty becomes\nmore apparent. But it is also this\naspect of it that makes it so amaz-ing, different and fascinating! I\nhope at least a few of you are convinced to join or to at least come to\na few sessions.\nSo, if you find yourself in the middle of the year and you just want to\nstart a new activity, why not start\nwith synchronised swimming?

Our main aim is to fundraise\nand raise awareness of MSF and its\nactivities.\nNo matter if you are an engineer-ing, mathematics, or physics stu-dent, you can still become actively\ninvolved in one of our five projects/\nteams; Collection, Merchandise,\nSmall events, MSF Talent Show\nand MSF Walk. You will not be a\nmere observer, instead, this is a\nchance to be an integrate part of a\nspecific team and be able to actively\ncontribute. You will have responsibilities within each team and your\nactions will directly impact on the\nsuccess of each fundraising activity\nand the success of our society as a\nwhole.\nWe also hope to encourage students to consider MSF or likemind-ed NGOs as a possible career post\ngraduation. Despite qualified doc-tors, MSF also needs logisticians,\naccountants, public health experts,\nand epidemiologists etc. to carry\non the work they do so well. Thus\nwe will invite individuals who have\nworked in the field to come and\nshare their experience.\nWhether you like to take action\nand get involved or simply meet\nothers from other courses, this is\nsomething for you!\nYou can contact us at Friendsofmsf@gmail.com for more in-formation.

Some of these\ncampaigns, such as last week\u02bcs RCSU O\ufb03ce protest,\nare high pro\ufb01le but many are less visible.\nOne of the things the Sabbatical team are trying to\ndo this year is raise the pro\ufb01le and e\ufb00ectiveness of\ncampaigns in general. We hope to do this by making\nsure these campaigns are well resourced, well coordinated and well supported.\nThis term will see the launch of several high pro\ufb01le\ncampaigns including \u201cGreen Week\u201d, \u201cFairtrade\nFortnight\u201d and an LGBT Awareness week, however,\nwe would like to see more campaigns on more\nissues in the future. This is why we are working\ntowards creating new dedicated campaign roles\nwithin the Union and we are looking for enthusiastic\nvolunteers to take on these roles.\nIf you are interested in getting involved in\ncampaigning and perhaps even leading a campaign,\nthen please get in touch with Ben Harris, the Union\u02bcs\nDeputy President for Education and Welfare (dpew@\nimperial.ac.uk). This year we hope to run campaigns\non the following issues:\n\u2022 Anti-Racism: campaigning for better race relations\nat Imperial.\n\u2022 Disabled students: working with the College to\nmake it more accommodating for students with\ndisabilities.\n\u2022 Environmental: campaigning for a greener\nImperial, focussing on Green Week this term.\n\u2022 Ethical: raising awareness of ethical issues\namongst Imperial students, focussing on Fairtrade\nFortnight this term.\n\u2022 LGBT: campaigning on Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and\nTransgender issues.\n\u2022 Womens\u02bc: organising events to encourage women\nto pursue a career in science, engineering and\ntechnology.\nHowever, if you want to propose your own\ncampaign, then please write to Ben or myself. ICU\nhas a reasonable budget for campaigns this year\nand we are able to provide professional support and\nadvice.\nCentenary\nNext week the Centenary will really get going with\nthe build-up to a massive\nlaunch on Tuesday 30th\nJanuary. On that day we\nwill also launch a new\nUnion Centenary website\nthat will advertise every\ncentenary event we plan\nto hold throughout the\nrest of the year. If your\nclub or society is planning\nto hold a centenary event\nthat we don\u02bct know about\nthen please contact Shiv Chopra (medic.president@\nimperial.ac.uk) as soon as possible.\nChips\nAnd \ufb01nally, an announcement that is long overdue.\nWhen I stood for President last year I deliberately\ndidn\u02bct promise to introduce chips to the Union\nsimply because I was under the impression that this\nwould be logistically too di\ufb03cult to do and recent\nPresidents had made this promise and failed to\ndeliver it. Thanks to hard work by our sta\ufb00 over\nthe Christmas, we are now able to o\ufb00er chips in the\nevenings! You can buy a small portion of chips from\n\u00a31 and potato wedges from \u00a32 any evening from\n4:30pm.\nunionpage\nCampaigns, Centenary and Chips\nJohn Collins\nPresident\npresident@imperial.ac.uk\nImperial College Union, Beit Quadrangle, Prince Consort\nRoad, London SW7 2BB\nTel: 020 7594 8060\nimperialcollegeunion.org\nAt this time of year many people don\u02bct feel\nthemselves. There have been many parties over the\nfestive period, you have probably all been back to\nyour hometown, met up with old friends and seen\nsome of your family for the \ufb01rst time in ages.\nChristmas can be a strange time of year, many of\nyou have probably had to buy presents for your\nfamily or perhaps some of you may have just had\na good time catching up with old friends; either of\nthese cases can be expensive.\nAs a student it can often be hard to budget for these\nthings after all you have rent to pay, fees, books\nfor education and of course need money to spend\non your leisure time, with all this in mind there is\nalways a temptation to borrow money at Christmas\nto fund your gift buying or your social life.\nThis money can be borrowed from a bank, personal\nloans, credit cards or sometimes from friends but\nthere is always a temptation to spend over your\nlimit at the festive time of year we call Christmas.\nOften after the last mince pie has been eaten and\nthe eggnog has \ufb01nished, the \ufb01rst credit card bill\narrives or your bank is on at you because you are\nover your overdraft.\nThe Information and Advice Centre may be able\nto help if you have over spent your budget at\nChristmas and now \ufb01nd yourself in a bad \ufb01nancial\nsituation. If you are having problems with credit\ncard companies or your bank, we can work out your\nincome and outgoings and write to these companies\non your behalf to negotiate a payment plan that you\ncan actually a\ufb00ord; we can advocate for you in this\nsituation.\nIt is also important that you prioritise your money\nin this situation, something like a credit card debt is\nnot essentially a priority debt. It is best that you look\nto pay things such as your rent, amenity bills and\nfees before looking at other debts, this is because if\nyou don\u02bct pay these things you will essentially lose\nsomething. For example if you don\u02bct pay your rent\nyou will be evicted, don\u02bct pay gas bill, you will be\ncut o\ufb00 and if you don\u02bct pay your fees you may be\nasked to leave college.\nWe can also help if you \ufb01nd you can\u02bct a\ufb00ord your\nfees or rent to the college. We write to the college\non behalf of many students and try to explain why\nyou can\u02bct a\ufb00ord these debts and also sometimes\nmake o\ufb00ers to them to negotiate a payment plan.\nIf you \ufb01nd yourself in heavy debt, it is important\nto tell people what is happening and not bury your\nhead in the sand. Most companies are willing to\nhelp if you \ufb01nd you cannot a\ufb00ord to pay them back\nthe money you owe them.\nOf course debt isn\u02bct just about the money, it can\nbring on other issues such as stress and worry.\nThese of course, can lead to you not being focused\non your academic work. It is important to talk\nto someone if you feel that the stress of debt is\na\ufb00ecting your work.\nYour \ufb01rst port of call\nshould be your personal\ntutor. If you \ufb01nd that they\nare not helpful or you don\u02bct\nfeel comfortable talking to\nthem, then the Information\nand Sdvice Centre can talk\nto your department for\nyou and explain what is\nhappening. We can try to\nnegotiate more time for\nyou to do your projects or at least let them know\nhow you are feeling leading up to an exam.\nThe college o\ufb00ers \ufb01nancial help in the form of the\naccess to learning fund. This is administered by\nthe student \ufb01nance o\ufb03ce and is for students who\nhave exhausted all other areas of income, not all\nstudents will be eligible for this. The Student Support\nO\ufb03cer, Phillipa Worley, administers this; you can\ncontact her on : student.support @imperial.ac.uk.\nThe Information and Advice Centre also has some\napplication forms for this fund.\nThe Information and Advice Centre also gives\ngeneral budgeting advice to students with regard\nto how to manage your money more e\ufb00ectively. We\ncan look at your expenditure and advise you on the\nareas you need to improve spending on.\nIf you feel you would like to contact the Information\nand Advice Centre on these issues or any other\nwelfare issues, you can contact us on: 020 7594\n8067 or advice@imperial.ac.uk.\nSpent Too Much on Eggnog?\nNigel Cooke\nStudent Adviser\nadvicet@imperial.ac.uk\n\n"

    "content": "Give RCSU\ntheir office!\nI\n\u2019ve always considered protesting as erm\u2026 something for the French. When French students go on\nstrike (students striking is an oxy-moron but that\nis another story) they go and throw bricks at par-liament. When we go on strike, the only reason you\nnotice is because the pubs are busier. ICU managed to\nget about 12 people to attend the top-up fees march last\nterm, hardly a sign of student activism being a major\nfeature in our lives and probably not a sufficient number\nfor the authorities to invoke the modern day equivalent\nof the Riot Act.\nBut wait a minute. What\u2019s that on the front page? Well,\nsome of us staged a protest, a protest that Felix will continue until RCSU get their desired office. The \u201cmeeja\u201d\n(sic) support the scientists in their fight for a decent of-fice. As you may know, the Engineers and Medics have\nthriving Faculty Union offices in prominent, easily accessible parts of campus whilst RCSU (currently operating\nout of a broom cupboard) were offered a dingy basement\nin Princes Gardens, hardly the beating heart of College.\nOur friends at the RCSU are naturally not best pleased\nat this. Felix believes that College are not only needlessly inconveniencing students but they are also shooting\nthemselves in the foot as RCSU have done a lot in the\nfew months they have been in existence which has had a\nhuge positive impact on the atmosphere of the College.\nHave a look at their website. They\u2019ve organised a fresh-ers ball, several bar nights and a football tournament. On\nthe less frivolous side they also hold regular welfare surgeries whose potential is hamstrung by the aforementioned broom cupboard they are currently soldiering on\nwith. Surely College should be encouraging volunteers\nwho give up their time to enhance the non-academic\nside of student life for everyone? This demotion is a slap\nin the face to a group of individuals who, according to\nthe Colleges own website, are giving up their time to run\ntours of the Queens Tower when the centenary celebrations launch at the beginning of February.\nIn recognition of the contribution made by the RCSU\nto College life and their tireless support for both the centenary celebrations and outreach programmes Felix are\nasking that College re-instate their original offer of the\nroom by the Walkway. As far as demands go, its hardly\nthe biggest one that you will ever hear and not the most\ndifficult one to accommodate. It has been commented\nthat the room in Princes Gardens was so far out of the\nway that you might as well have offered them a room out\nat Wye! By re-instating the original offer you\u2019ll make a\nlot of people very happy, the same people who you are\nrelying on to contribute towards the success of the centenary launch. Go on, you know you want to! If only in\nappreciation of the comical value of our makeshift office\nin Upper Dalby Court staffed by a Union Sabbatical looking out of place wearing some rather snazzy golf gear.\nI\nt is pretty standard for people\nfrom most cultures to make new\nyear resolutions. It\u2019s like a shedding skin for a snake, except that\nfor human beings it doesn\u2019t really work! It looks like as if we, like the\nsnake, had an infinite amount of similar\nlayers. Let me explain.\nA perfectly common new year\u2019s resolution is to lose weight. Even your fellow writer (a.k.a. FatFlaps 3000) that\nis presenting you this masterpiece of\ncontemporary literature did it! And that\nit\u2019s why the gyms are always full of giant pieces of bacon running the shit out\nof themselves on treadmills or dislocating their shoulder while trying to bench\n5kgs. But don\u2019t worry fellow vain and\nbrainless buffers: your lovely Ethos will\nsoon be back to normal and you will be\nable to walk around showing your guns\nor new 8-pack to all the three girls in the\nworld that actually care.\nPeople also usually try to convince\nthemselves that \u201cYeah! This year I\u2019ll\nstart going to the library and do at least\nhalf an hour of work everyday!\u201d. This\nwould be perfect and actually work if it\nwasn\u2019t for the small problem that everyone with half the normal amount of sexual hormones needs to go out and hunt\nfor the opposite sex. And this implies,\nfor most people, drinking in moderation,\nand drinking in moderation implies sex.\nWhat a theory! If life was this simple I\nwould have 10 kids right now and made\nlove (notice that I\u2019m not insensible\nenough to write fuck the shit out of) to as\nmany virgins as there are waiting for suicide bombers in heaven. But unluckily\nfor me and for the fellow-reader-who\u2019sResolutions for 2007\nDiogo Geraldes\npenis-is-about-to-fall-off-due-to-exces-sive-self-loving-at-night-while-watching-Rachel\u2019s-perfect-boobs-in-Friends\nlife isn\u2019t that simple, specially if you\ncome from countries where girls are\nactually fit. The theory then changes to\ngoing out implies drinking, then walking\naround the club trying to find someone\ngood enough to deflower, drink, walk,\ndrink, drink, drink, walk, drink, cab ride\nto fuckland, fat girl on top of you (or\nfat guy), then bang, congratulations!\nYou\u2019re a dad! Did you revise that day\u2019s\nlectures at all? No! And you\u00b4ll probably\nfeel like shit after you wake up missing\nMr. Kidney in a bathtub full of ice the\nnext day and won\u2019t feel like it either.\nAnother quite popular resolution is to\nquit smoking! I have actually witnessed\npeople quitting at midnight and never\ntouch a cigarette again until 10 minutes later I see them smoking like as if\ntheir lungs committed crimes against\nmankind and deserved to be punished!\nAnd if they do quit they have to stuff\nthemselves with chocolate and other\nsweet things like 13 year old teenage\ngirls who didn\u2019t make it in to the cheerleading squad! Why did most people\nstart smoking? Not because they liked,\nbut definitely because when they were\nyoung it was cool to do it. I\u2019m sorry if it\nisn\u2019t anymore, but guess what: you are\nstuck with a vicious habit that will probably take both your lungs and your right\ntesticle away from you! So don\u2019t fight it,\njust enjoy it while you can!\nThere are more new year resolutions\nthat I could talk about till your ass feels\nnumb from seating on the toilet for so\nlong, but I think I made my point. They\nare useless but we still make them any-way! Do we make them to actually try to\nchange our lives and become new peo-ple? I do personally think that it is only\nto make us feel better, newborn, capable of everything, even if for 3 or 4 days.\nBut I have to stop with this mind\nramblings since I have more important\nthings to do: I have my second personal\ntraining session after revising today\u2019s\nlectures! Oh, but first I need to stop\nby the chemist to buy some nicotine\npatches!\nFelix, Beit Quad, Prince Consort Road, London SW7 2BB. Tel 020 7594\n8072. Fax 020 7594 8065.
