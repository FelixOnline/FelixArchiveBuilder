The Union leadership\nsaid \u201caccessing the roof required a series\nof extremely dangerous manoeuvres\u201d.\nAccessinvolvedclimbingoverastairwell\nwhich anyone involved could have fallen\nfrom and significantly injured themself.\nThe roof was accessed through a\nwindow with a broken restrictor, which\nmeant it could be opened fully and a\nperson could fit through.

A fall from such\na height could have had \u201clife altering\nconsequences\u201d.\nThe incident came to the Union\u2019s\nattention as a result of a separate\ncomplaint over alleged racism in\na WhatsApp chat which bar staff\nmembers used to discuss work-related\ntopics. Part of the evidence submitted\nin this complaint included images of the\nindividuals in question on the roof of\nthe Union building.\nCasual workers at the Union bars,\nincluding those in managerial positions,\nare not full employees. They are\nemployed by the College on casual, or\n\u201czero hour\u201d, contracts, and are able to\nsign up to shifts as and when they see fit,\nthough permanent staff may encourage\ncasual workers to take up more shifts\nin certain circumstances. Because of\nthis casual worker status, the decision\nto remove those involved from their\njobs is considerably easier than if they\nwere full employees. It is worth noting,\nhowever, that the Union chose to follow\na full process under ACAS guidelines as\nif those involved were employees. This\nis significantly more than was legally\nrequired.\nIn the investigation of the\nstudent employees surrounding\ntheir membership of the Union,\nthe investigating officer was Union\nPresident Dr Lloyd James. The final\ndecision was reached by a panel formed\nfrom the Governance and Membership\ncommittee within the Union.\nJames recently brought a paper to\nthe Governance and Membership\nCommitteewhichaddedammendments\nto the existing disciplinary procedure\nheld by the Union.

    "content": "The underrated yeast\nScience.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nFRIDAY 7TH JANUARY 2022\n3\nEdited by: Isabelle Zhang\nJamie John\nCara Burke\nMarek Cottingham\nScience\nThe vast majority of us have encoun-teredyeastatsomepointinourlives\nin food, such as bread or cake, or in alco-hol. But have you ever considered what\nthese brown or white lozenges actually\nare? The colloquial term \u201cyeast\u201d refers\nto a group of unicellular and free-living\nfungi with around 10,000 species. The\napplication of yeast is not just limited\nto making your bread spongier. In fact,\nyeasts, in particular baker\u2019s yeast, have\nbeen instrumental in the development\nof our civilisation.\nKEY PROPERTIES\nThere are two core properties of yeasts\nthat make them important to both humans and nature.\nFirstly, they are facultative anaerobes,\nwhich means they don\u2019t need oxygen\nto obtain energy, but can use oxygen, if\navailable, to obtain energy via cellular\nrespiration. In the absence of oxygen,\nfacultative anaerobes respire by fermen-tation, a process which consumes the\nsame amount of glucose as cellular res-piration, but produces much less energy.\nThe advantage of fermentation is that\nit is faster and does not require oxygen.\nThere are different types of fermenta-tion, but all yeasts use alcoholic fermen-tation, producing CO2\nand ethanol (al-cohol). These two substances are key to\nthe application of yeast in industry.\nSecondly, although yeasts are capable of carrying out sexual reproduction,\ntheir main means of reproduction are binary fission and budding, both forms of\nasexualreproduction.Binaryfissioncon-sists of the division of a mother cell into\ntwo daughter cells in equal proportions,\nwhile budding means that a fragment of\nthe mother cell with some DNA, cytosol and membranes are separated from it\nand continue their own development to\nmaturity. Asexual reproduction is much\nfaster than sexual reproduction, which\nmakes obtaining large quantities of yeast\neasy. This is essential to the food industry\u2019s abilty to meet the constant demand\nfor fermented products.\nIN THE ENVIRONMENT\nYeasts are essential for the health\nand balance of ecosystems. Living in\nmoist and mild environments, they are a\nsource of food for bacteria, protozoans,\nand other microbial predators. Besides,\nsoil yeasts help in delivering matter, particularly carbon, across the soil.\nIN INDUSTRY\nThe impact of a particular yeast called\nSaccharomyces cerevisiae, also known as\nbaker\u2019s yeast or brewer\u2019s yeast, in the development of our civilization cannot be\nunderstated. Records of the domestication of baker\u2019s yeast date back to Mesopotamia and Ancient Egypt, to around\n4,000 BCE. The importance of yeast to\nhumanity lies in its role in bread and alcohol production.\nThe grains of grasses such as wheat\nand rye are amongst our main sources\nof energy. These seeds contain a long\ncomplex sugar called starch, which is\nan excellent supply of energy. However, starch has one major\nproblem: it is tasteless.\nThe function of\nbaker\u2019s yeast is to ferment the tasteless\nstarch into simple sugars like glucose, which\nare sweeter and easier\nto digest. .\nIn the case of bread,\nthe CO2\nreleased during fermentation causes dough to rise, creating the the signature\npockets of air in bread,\nand similar baker\u2019s\nproducts. When fermented dough is\nheated in an oven, the\ntrapped CO2\nexpands\nand makes the bread\nWang Guo Staff Writer\nHow the brown stuff we add to bread is used in, and is changing, the world we live in today.\nPhoto credits: Rodolfo\nMarques/Unsplash\nPhoto credits: Brett\nJordan/Unsplash\nrise further. The expressed ethanol evap-orates, leaving only the simple sugar and\nthe dead yeasts. The dead yeasts, due to\ntheir high amino acids, lipids and sugar\ncontent, add flavour.\nIn the case of alcoholic drinks, the\nCO2\nand ethanol are not lost. Alongside the remnants of yeast, they give\nthese drinks their appealing flavours\nand colours (dead yeasts are typically\nfiltered out!). The process of making\nbread and wine using baker\u2019s yeast has\naccompanied humanity from its first\nsteps through to big empires and wars,\nand the influence of baker\u2019s yeast on our\neconomy is still present. For example, $1\ntrillion of the USA\u2019s $19 trillion GDP is\ndirectly dependent upon yeast \u2013 that is\n5% of the world\u2019s biggest economy!\nIN RESEARCH\nIn biology research, baker\u2019s yeast is\none of the organisms used to study eukaryotic cells because of its short life\ncycle (a few hours) and relatively small\ngenome. Unlike multicellular organisms\nlike the common mouse, baker\u2019s yeast is\ncheap and easy to grow. Furthermore,\nyeasts are the target of genetic\nengineering.\nThey have been\nused with the ground-breaking gene-ed-iting tool, CRISPR-Cas9. Compared\nto other living organisms, it is relatively\neasier to edit yeast DNA precisely and\neffectively. This not only makes genetic\nengineering easier to carry out, but also\nmeans more positive outcomes. Indeed,\nthe usage of genetically modified yeasts\nin our world is already a reality. Genetically modified yeast is used to synthesize\nuseful molecules such as insulin or anti-biotics.\nAT IMPERIAL\nIt seems apt to conclude with the use\nof yeast in research at Imperial. One of\nthe most ambitious research projects related to yeast is the Synthetic Genome\nProject (also referred to as Sc2.0) carried\noutbylaboratoriesacrosstheworld.Tom\nEllis, Professor of Synthetic Genome\nEngineering at Imperial, is one of the\nUK project leaders. Sc2.0 is attempting\nto create a synthetic genome of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (baker\u2019s yeast) based\non the DNA sequences of the original\ngenome. If the project is successful, it\nwill be a major milestone in genetic en-gineering, as the first organism created\nentirelyinalaboratory.Itcouldopenthe\ndoor for the editing of even more complex living beings, perhaps even humans\nwith genetic diseases.\n\n"

    "content": "FRIDAY 7TH JANUARY 2022\n11\nMUSIC\nMusic.felix@imperial. ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nPressure Machine by The\nKillers\nExpect nothing less than\na massive genre detour,\ndriven by Brandon Flower\u2019s\nsudden realisation that he\u2019s\nnever sung about what he\nknows best \u2013 growing up in\nthe \u201cWest Hills\u201d of Nephi,\nUtah. Even though I relate to nothing in this folk rock\nalbum about a blossoming opioid epidemic in a deeply\nreligious state, listening to it is like walking a nearly\ninvasive path through Flower\u2019s memoirs. I suppose\nit\u2019s best described as the responsibility you feel when\nsomeone trusts you with something very close to them.\nDelta Kream by The Black\nKeys\nThe number of times I\u2019ve\nplayed this album through\nmy house to let this cool\nnonchalance take over and\nblock out the rest of the\nworld is embarrassing. It\u2019s\nDan Auerbach and Patrick\nCarney\u2019s covers of old country-blues rock standards\nbelonging to the Mississippi Delta. Does it make a\ndifference that the Black Keys grew up listening to this\nmusic? Of course it does. I love that I can listen to their\nversions of what they listened to \u2013 there\u2019s something\nincredibly meaningful about it that I can\u2019t put into\nwords. If the first track, \u2018Crawling Kingsnake\u2019, doesn\u2019t\nreel you in, \u2018Going Down South\u2019 will do just as well.\nBlue Weekend by Wolf\nAlice\nThis one became a\nfavourite the moment\nI heard Ellie Rowsell\nwhisper-singing carefully\nenunciated lyrics in the\nfirst track of the album,\ncrescendo-ing into the sort\nof sound you would imagine a thousand seated people\nslowly standing up to. While a large fraction of the\nalbum is atmospheric, I love how Rowsell sings about\nher sensitivity and vulnerabilities in curtly whispered\nsentences in \u2018Smile\u2019. There\u2019s enough in this album to\nsupplementnightsofheartbreak,angerandjustgeneral\nromantic angst.\nTerra Firma by Tash\nSultana\nAs most things by\nTash Sultana, this album\nis another world of her\npsychedelic reggae-rock\nsounds, strung together by\nher characteristic (for the\nlack of a better word) wavy\nelectric and acoustic guitar layering. Yes, she\u2019s a mad\nmulti-instrumentalist, but what stood out to me the\nmost was her voice. \u2018Dream My Life Away\u2019, featuring\nJohn Cashman, reminded me how much emotion her\nvoice can carry, even though a feel-good tropical track\nlike\u2018PrettyLady\u2019showsanothersmooth,seductiveside\nof her that is just as appealing.\nOK Human by Weezer\nYeah, I know. If you\nasked me last year, I would\nnot believe you if you told\nme my top album would\nbe a Weezer record, but\nit is. This project is short,\nsweet, and impeccably\nproduced, with a lovely mix\nof orchestral sounds and strings creating a blissful and\nhappy vibe that very much kept me going through the\ndepressing start of 2021. With no dull Weezer guitar\nriffs or lazy Rivers Cuomo lyricism, Ok Human has\ncompletely exceeded any of my expectations. This is no\ndoubtWeezer\u2019sbestrecordtodate,andjudgingbytheir\nsecond release this year, they\u2019ve gone back to being shit\nalready. Either way, what an incredible album. Weezer\nwill never be this good again.\nTyron by Slowthai\nSlowthai\u2019s second release\nhas all the best elements\nthat made his breakout\ndebut visceral, raw and\nexciting. On the first disc,\nslowthai unloads his anger\nand aggression, with slick\nand energetic delivery\nunique to his rapping style and tracks with Skepta\nand ASAP Rocky that hit as hard as ever. What really\nmakes this project, however, is the second disc, which\nfeatures a change in tempo, transitioning into a more\nmelancholic, emotionally intense atmosphere, with\nsome lovely features from artists like James Blake and\nDeb Never. Tracks like \u2018feel away\u2019, \u2018adhd\u2019 and \u2018I tried\u2019\nare thoughtful, touching, and sad, with slowthai\ndisplaying some of his best lyricism to date.\nBy The Time I Get To\nPhoenix by Injury Reserve\nArguably the heaviest\nlisten on this list, By The\nTime I Get To Phoenix\nis disorienting, noisy,\ncacophonous, and\nabsolutely terrifying and\nblood-boiling at times.\nAs much as I\u2019m in love with what Injury Reserve has\ndone on this project, I get an existential crisis every\ntime I put tracks like \u2018Ground Zero\u2019 or \u2018Top Picks\nfor You\u2019 on. The entire album is so far from anything\ncommonly referred to as music, while still walking\nthis line perfectly, without sounding pretentious or\nexperimental for its own sake. Alongside legends like\nPeggy, Parker Corey has definitely made the cut as one\nof my favourite producers. Moreover, Ritchie\u2019s and\nStepa\u2019s rapping on this cut is as memorable as ever.\nHonestly, I could not hype this project up enough.\nInjury Reserve has knocked it out the park.\n30 by Adele\nThesinglemum,divorced\nqueen has returned with,\nyes, a divorce record. Being\nabout divorce, this album\nhonestly isn\u2019t too relatable\nthematically, but oh my god\ndoes it make me tear up at\ntimes. Adele\u2019s powerful\nvocals running over beautiful piano melodies create\nan absolutely heart-wrenching vibe. The album reads\nlike an introspective journey, Adele\u2019s meditation on\nher overconsuming sadness. The sometimes awkwardly\nlong cuts that drag out longer than you\u2019d expect them\nto make it feel like the album wasn\u2019t really made for\nus, but for her. In a weird way, this makes the sadness\neven more potent for me, as it comes across as messy,\npersonalandraw.I\u2019mtrulyenamouredwiththisalbum.\nNo doubt her most mature effort so far.\nSometimes I Might Be\nIntrovert by Little Simz\nI\u2019m really glad Little\nSimz is finally gaining\ntraction in the hip hop\nscene, with hard hitting\nproduction and flows very\nfew artists in the rap game\ncan match. After the darker\nand heavier \u2018Grey area\u2019, Simz reminds us of her stylistic\nversatility in her new record this year that revives a\nmore soulful, glamorous and lush sound present on her\ndebut. The teaser track \u2018Introvert\u2019 is easily my favourite\nsingle of the year, with epic horns, beautiful strings and\nan elegant song structure that draws you in completely.\nThe whole album is catchy to its core, with tracks\nlike \u2018Point and kill\u2019 also showing African influences.\nHonestly, this project is so tasteful and unique and I\u2019m\nreally excited to see where she takes us next.\nCalvacade by black midi\nFrom the opening drums\nof \u2018John L\u2019, Calvacade\nimmerses you in the world\nof black midi. The album\nis almost a subversion on\ntheir post-punk influenced\ndebut Schlagenheim,\nthough its dissonant\nvirtuosic passages and intense feelings of trepidation\nremain. Without sounding pretentious, one must\nhear Calvacade live to truly experience this album,\neven if just to witness drummer Morgan Simpson\nat his craft. The rhythmic cohesion displayed by the\nband throughout fast-paced improvisatory-esque riffs,\nsquealingsaxophonemovements,andsyncopatedstabs\nMatija Conic\nThe only DJ with revoked aux-cord privileges\nRosie Millns\nNever left their emo phase\n\n"

    "content": "Melissa Harisson\u2019s All Among the Barley was\na pretty odd choice for me, I must admit.\nI work at the Amnesty bookshop in Hammersmith\nand come across all kinds of books every week, some\nof which are so archaic that they cannot be read, and\nsome that have been published so recently it\u2019s scarcely\nbelievable that they have already been read and\ndonated. Of all these books, All Among the Barley\nstuck out purely because of the unparalleled reviews\nit had recieved. \u201cBook of the year\u201d from four separate\npublications.\u201cAstonishing\u201d,\u201cStartling\u201d,\u201cAmasterpiece\u201d.\nSet in 1933, the story is seen through the eyes\nof 14 year old Edith (Edie) Mather, daughter of a\nfarmer in rural England where the Great War still\ncasts a lengthy shadow. Living the normal inter-war\nlife of a child, Edie has always struggled to make\nfriends and spends as much time as she can reading, in\nbetween her mandatory duties of helping mother with\nhousework or father in the field. The first interuption\nto this monotony is seen when the tall, beautiful,\nandrogynous Constance Fitzallen turns up out of the\nblue from the city, intent on writing about the ways of\nrural communities and the wholesome aspects of life\nthat she believes city folk have lost. Breaking many\nof the norms seen as fundamental to being female,\nthe impressionable Edie feels a cocktail of emotions\ntowards Constance from the first time she meets her.\nThe cocktail shaker is shaken even harder when\nEdie interacts with Alf Rose, a boy three years her\nsenior and son of the far richer neighbouring farmer.\nThe book provides a fantastic insight into the\ntrue patriarchy of communities in the \u201830s. Edie\u2019s\nmother is told she will only vote the way her husband\ntells her to, and the family spend great swathes of\ntime tip-toeing around an untouchable, drunken\nfather who only gets away with his actions because\nhe is \u201chead of the house\u201d. Through the whole book\nthe only character we see undertaking a task not\nbefitting their gender is the metropolitan Fitzallen.\nHarrison does a fantastic job of maintaining the\nsense that things may be turned upside down at any\nmoment without ever actually saying it. The book\nfollows Edie\u2019s attempted to make her own opinions\non the world around her through the impacts of the\nwar that she never saw, the changing politics of the\nAmor Towles\u2019 New York Times bestseller \u2018A\nGentleman in Moscow\u2019 is a book that can\nvery literally be described as a pleasure to read.\nNot because of the intricacies of the plot (although\nthere are many), or because of how gripping a page-turner it is, but because of the way it\u2019s written.\nStarting in the year 1922 in, you guessed it,\nMoscow, Count Alexander Ilyich Rostov is on trial in\na Bolshevik court for his prior status: Recipient of the\nOrder of Saint Andrew, Member of the Jockey Club,\nMaster of the Hunt. Born a rich gentleman, and it is\nnot the business of gentlemen to have occupations,\nRostov is sentenced at the age of 30 to indefinite\nconfinement in the city\u2019s Metropol Hotel for his old\nlife of bourgeoisie, with the knowledge that should he\never step outside the building\u2019s walls, he will promptly\nbe shot. The book follows Rostov\u2019s life within the walls\nof the hotel over the proceeding decades, backdropped\nby the phenomenally turbulent external Russia as it\nembraces Bolshevism, industrialisation, nuclearisation,\nand eventually destalinisation. Our protagonist is\nallowed many of the luxuries of his old life whilst\nbeing eternally held in the confines thrust upon him\nby the state. His life looks to be monotonous until\ndeath, when he meets a young girl of 9, staying in the\nhotel indefinitely under the watch of a governess.\nAs the book remains almost entirely centred on the\nCount throughout, the reader knows his personality\nlikethebackoftheirhandbythetimetheyhavefinished\nthe final chapter. Written in the third person, yet as if\nfrom the Count\u2019s perspective (he is always referred to\nas \u2018the Count\u2019 even 30 years after his confinement),\neach sentence is beautifully crafted and peppered with\nreferences to the literature and high society of the past.\nThe Count is always the cleverest in the room, though\nalmost every character we meet teaches him something\nnew about the life he believes he has mastery of.\nTowles\u2019 writing is astonishing. The Count doesn\u2019t\nwrite, but has been known \u2018to fence with a quill\u2019. A\nyoung man courting his daughter in secret is \u2018clearly\nas villainous a viper as has ever slithered from the\nunderbrush of Eden\u2019. Some chapters come almost as\nasides, where the reader spends several pages indulging\nin the craft of perfecting a fish stew, or finds themself\nin the orchards of the Count\u2019s youth with no character\nother than a honey bee having ventured there.\nIf you are after a thriller then this one is not\nfor you, but I think the amalgamation of history,\nromance and kinship has something in it for almost\nanyone. And remember, even if you don\u2019t enjoy it,\nthe surest sign of wisdom is constant cheerfulness.\nFRIDAY 7TH JANUARY 2022\nBooks.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk 15\nA Gentleman in Moscow - Amor Towles\nReviews\nSam Lovatt Editor-in-Chief\nAll Among the Barley - Melissa Harrison\nSam Lovatt Editor-in-Chief\nBOOKS\ntime and a revolution of labour leaving many behind\nas the tractor overtakes the horse-drawn plough.\nOutstandingdescriptionsoftheEnglishcountryside\nand excellent historical insight of the times lead\nto a crescendo that few will see coming.

I\nalways find something new\nwhen listening to For the\nfirst time, whether it is by\ndigging through the layers\nof music or by finding\nmeaning in a cryptic\nmetaphor. This project\nenables you to have a peek\nat the very best of the London scene, which I strongly\nrecommend supporting live.\n??? by Anthony1\nI\u2019ll say it straight up: this\nalbum is not for everyone.\nBut that is what makes it\nspecial. Chilean producer\nAnthony1 has developed\na highly compressed,\ncrushed-up style of trance,\nwhich invokes some kind\nof catharsis within its hypnotic repetition. Having only\nsix tracks, the album runs through about 33 minutes\nand mostly follows the standard trance song structure.\nWhatIfindbeautifulintheprojectistheIcarianwayin\nwhich Anthony1 pushes the limit of his sound design,\ntransforming his songs into audible versions of deep-fried JPEGs \u2013 but in a good way, I promise.\nAttendees of a New Year\u2019s Eve party report awkwardly averting their gaze from their friend who\nstood in the corner of the room for the entire party\nwith his headphones on.\nFriends say he asked for the aux in the first 40\nminutes of the party, to which everybody blithered\nthat \u201ca playlist had already been made\u201d, \u201ceverybody\nwas really enjoying the vibe as it was\u201d and \u201cmaybe just\npossibly folk-punk wasn\u2019t the vibe for a New Year\u2019s Eve\nparty\u201d. Sources report that he slipped his headphones\non when Doja Cat played, and spent the rest of the\nnight hovering in the corner by the aux cord drinking\nRed Stripe on his own.\nPartygoers who voiced concern over the guy alone\nin the corner were warned by friends that they would\nget sucked into a conversation about the differences\nbetween shoegaze and dreampop if they went over to\ncheck up on him.\nAfter midnight had passed, friends tried to wish\nhim a happy New Year but could just hear the muffled\nsoundof \u2018Waltz#2(XO)\u2019fromtheheadphonesaround\nhis neck as they chatted. Those who had approached\nhim made haste to leave after they heard Red House\nPainters playing from his headphones.\nAttendees were questioned on why they were so\nindifferent and heartless towards the plight of a friend\nhaving a bad time at the party.\n\u201cNew Year\u2019s Eve 2019, we let him have the aux for\na bit, mostly so that he would stop creeping girls out\nby telling them the Pac-Man line from Scott Pilgrim.\nIt was getting embarrassing for all of us,\u201d said a close\nfriend, who asked to remain anonymous. \u201cAs soon as\nhe had the aux he exclusively queued up songs by Xiu\nXiu and Slint. Man, I love Xiu Xiu but it just didn\u2019t\nfit the vibe.\u201d He paused, gazing into the distance\nwith distress visible on his brow. \u201cWe entered 2020\nlistening to Neutral Milk Hotel.

The event was scheduled to take place in\njust over three weeks time.\nThe 2021 Grammy Awards, which were also\npostponed, were held in March last year as a hybrid\nbetween recorded and live performances. The\nceremony was drastically scaled down, and hosts had\nhoped that a normal live ceremony could occur this\nyear. A new date has not yet been announced.\nThe 2022 Grammys will be the first year with\na reformed voting process following criticisms of\ncorruption regarding the previous system, over which\nThe Weeknd famously boycotted the awards show for\nlife. Changes made include the removal of anonymous\nand unaccountable committees which previously\ndecided the nominations for key categories.\nNominees for the 2022 Grammys include huge\nnames such as ABBA, Billie Eilish, Lil Nas X, and\nJustin Bieber. Jon Batiste, the jazz keyboardist who\nwrote the soundtrack to Pixar film Soul, dominates\nthe awards with an incredible 11 nominations, whilst\nOlivia Rodrigo leads with 7 nominations, including in\nall major categories, for her debut album Sour.

The only thing worse than Coldplay is people\nwho don\u2019t like Coldplay and have an incessant need\nto tell you in a pretentious rant how much they hate\nColdplay. Once upon a time hating Coldplay told\npeople that you were edgy, but it has now become\nthe equivalent of sharing a meme from 2010: it\u2019s a bit\ncringe, the joke is overdone, and it leaves the same\nstale taste in your mouth that you inexplicably develop\nafter watching a film with Adam Sandler in it. I traipse\na delicate line in writing this article, during which I\npromise to try my hardest to not slip into a pretentious\nrant.\nLead singer of Coldplay Chris Martin announced\non the Radio 2 over Christmas that in 2025, the final\nColdplay album will come out, and after that they will\nnever release music again. The announcement comes\nafter Martin said that Coldplay would stop releasing\nmusic after their 12th album. With nine albums\nreleased, that gives three to go in three years.\nThat doesn\u2019t mean Coldplay are breaking up though.\nThe band plan to tour on their previously released\nmusic. With many citing Coldplay\u2019s 4th studio album,\nViva la Vida or Death and All His Friends, as the last\nColdplay album they enjoyed, perhaps they should\nhave made that decision five albums ago.\nTheir decision to only tour comes three years after\nthey announced they would not tour until they could\ndo so in a sustainable way. Despite their plan to plant\ntrees for sold tickets, and use flooring that generates\nelectricity when concertgoers jump, this is a complete\nU-turn from a band that acknowledge environmentally\ndetrimental aspects of touring: estimates place kinetic\nflooring techniques as generating less than 5% of the\nenergy used at a typical Coldplay concert. On top of\nthis, the band have decided to continue to use private\njets. It\u2019s a hypocritical move from a band trying to\nplace themselves at the forefront of a sustainable music\nindustry.\nMaybe by 2025 when Coldplay commit to being a\ntouring-only band they will also commit to having\ngenuinelysustainabletours.Ormaybetheywillcontinue\ndesperate grabs for headline news by committing to\ndiluted sustainability efforts and making statements\nabout their goals as a plan for three years\u2019 time.\n\n"

    "content": "Elizabeth Holmes, founder of dissolved blood testing start-up Theranos, has been convicted of fraud at a trial\nin California.\nIn 2014, Theranos was estimated to\nbe worth $9 billion, making Holmes the\nyoungest ever female self-made billion-aire. Described as \u201cthe next Steve Jobs\u201d,\ntouted as a Silicon Valley marvel by the\nmedia, and appearing in TIME magazine\u2019s list of 100 most influential people\nin 2015, she has taken quite a tumble,\nfollowing the cease of Theranos\u2019 activity\nin 2018.\nShe was initially put on trial for 10\ncounts of wire fraud and one count of\nconspiracy to commit wire fraud. Her\ndefence attempted to paint Holmes as a\nvictim of Ramesh (Sunny) Balwani, her\nex-boyfriend and Chief Operating Officer of Theranos.\nOf the 11 total counts, Holmes was\nconvicted of three counts of wire fraud\nand one of conspiracy. She is yet to be\nsentenced, however each charge individually carries a sentence of up to 20 years.\nHolmes explained at one point that\nher device worked like this: \u201ca chemistry is performed so that a chemical\nreaction occurs and generates a signal\nfrom the chemical interaction with the\nsample, which is translated into a result,\nwhich is then reviewed by certified laboratory personnel\u201d. This was told to The\nNew Yorker, and has been described\nby CNBC since as \u201cthe quote that\ndoomed... Theranos\u201d.\nThe defence said Holmes \u201cnaively underestimated the challenges her business\nfaced\u201d, along with her being manipulated by Balwani. The quote above brings\ninto question whether Holmes was at\nthis point floundering beyond the point\nof no return, having known all along\nthat the technology would never exist,\nor whether she was \u201cfaking it until she\nmade it\u201d and was genuinely naive to the\ncost of her actions.\nThe defence\u2019s case of Holmes\u2019 victim-hood polarised much of the commentar-iat. A $9 billion valuation does not just\ncome from nowhere, and given the now\nclear absence of scientific undertanding\nof the device, investor confidence was\nbuilt largely by force of personality, to\nthe heights of the Walton family of Walmart and Larry Ellison. People close to\nHolmes, before investigations into Theranos began, have said that following her\ncomparison to Steve Jobs, she intentionally lowered her voice to a \u201cbaratone\u201d,\nan idiosyncrisy that apparently was lost\nafter a few drinks, and intentionally\ndressed in Jobs\u2019 trademark black tur-tleneck. While doing nothing to prove\nguilt at the trial, such behaviours cetain-lysuggestapersonwhoknowswhatthey\nare doing.\nA behaviour that does suggest guilt\ncomes from testimony by lab directors\nat her trial, stating they had warned that\nthe technology was flawed but were told\nto downplay their concerns, at a time\nwhen Holmes was telling investors that\nthe technology was working as planned.\nHolmes approached Rupert Murdoch,\nTheranos investor and owner of the\nWall Street Journal, to ask him to block\npublication of an investigation into the\ncredibility of Theranos\u2019 technology. Her\nrequest was in vain, and the published\nstory began a cascade ending in the collapse of the company.\nOthers saw the defence\u2019s narrative as\ncompletely plausible. Balwani is 19 years\nolder than Holmes and the pair met\nwhen he was 37 and she was just 18. The\ntrial shed light on strings of texts, that\ncould be seen as abusive, from Balwani\nto Holmes. In her own defence, Holmes testified that Balwani had both emotionally and sexually abused her during\ntheir relationship, allegations which he\ndenies. Balwani will go on trial over the\ncoming months on charges similar to\nHolmes\u2019, where another jury will decide\nhow pivotal he was in the company\u2019s\nfraudulent activities.\nFaking it until you make it, while\nsounding blatantly immoral, is not actually too uncommon in start-ups such\nas Theranos. Now-giants such as Uber\nand AirBnB launched their ideas having\ndone sparingly little to ensure the laws\nof the land were in their favour and have\nsuffered lengthy, costly legal battles as a\nresult. What separates Theranos from\nthese examples is attempts to fool reg-ulators, some of which were successful.\nPatients who took part in fudged clinical trials said they had been misdiagnosed with HIV by gimic devices. Trials\nsupposedly testing Theranos\u2019 technology were carried out using commercially\navailable machines.\nThe time period between the investigation and the trial delivers quite a blow\nto Holmes, with advances in medical\ntechnology bringing a device close to\nwhat Holmes promised being trialled\nby the NHS in England as of September 2021, and being already in use in the\nUSA. The Galleri Detection Test can\nscreen for over 50 different types of cancer using a simple blood sample, a function that could have kept Holmes in the\nblack had it been discovered just a few\nyears earlier.\nKEEP THE CAT FREE\n4 Sustainability.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nSCIENCE\nSam Lovatt Editor-in-Chief\nElizabeth Holmes, founder and CEO of the now-defunct Theranos, notably wearing a turtleneck\nreminiscent of those worn by the late Steve Jobs.\nPhoto credits: TechCrunch, CC BY 2.0\nBlood-testing startup founder\nconvicted of fraud\n12.9\nmm\nThe blood test offered by Theranos\nPhoto credits: WIRED\n\n"

    "content": "16 Books.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nBooks.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nKEEP THE CAT FREE\nV2 - Robert Harris\nSam Lovatt Editor-in-Chief\nIbegan this book a Robert Harris virgin and so\nam perhaps not the best qualified to review\nthis novel. Everyone I have spoken to about it has\ninstead recommended either the Cicero series, or\nFatherland, or both. Nevertheless, in the interest\nof remaining succinct I will have a stab anyway.\nV2 tells two alternating, opposing narratives that\nrun side by side over the course of five days, often to the\nsecond. It\u2019s the winter of 1944 and the Germans have\nall but lost the war in Europe. Desperate for anything\nflashy that may strike fear into the allied hearts, Hitler\nthrowscolossalamountsofmoneyattheNazi\u2019sballistic\nrocket programme, headed by Wernher von Braun, a\nnon-fictional historical figure who also appears in the\nbook. We join the German story with Dr Rudi Graf, a\nrocket engineer whose dream since he was a little boy\nhas been to go to space. To much internal confliction,\nGraf\u2019s dream has been hijacked by the Nazi party\nand he finds himself launching his life\u2019s work from\nScheveningen, Netherlands towards London in the\nfor of Vengance 2 (V2) rockets, the most powerful\nballistics in the world that travel at three times the\nspeed of sound. Graf is not a member of the Nazi party\nand never had dreams of causing anyone harm, and is\nforced to grapple with with this moral dilemma ever\nmore as the Nazi\u2019s hopes become bleaker by the day.\nWe first see London through the eyes of Kay CatonWalsh,anofficerintheWoman\u2019sAuxiliaryAirForce.At\njust 24, Kay has been plucked straight from Cambridge\nuniversity and is working in intelligence at a stately\nhome in the English countryside, studying the minute\ndiscrepancies between ordinance imagery for signs of\nenemy activity. All of a sudden, the announcement of a\nsecret, urgent mission and her adulterous connections\nland her in a select team of WAAF officers tasked\nwith stopping the carnage being wrought by the\nV2s, the likes of which the world has never seen and\nwhich London currently has no hope of stopping.\nDespite being relatively short, the books at some\npointsseemslikeit\u2019stryingtobelongerthanitneedsto.\nWhethertoattemptverysubtlecharacterdevelopment,\nor floundering to increase the word count I\u2019m not sure,\nbut both main characters go off on narrative archs\nthat have no real impact on the storyline and could\neasily have been omitted with nothing of the tale lost.\nThat being said, and famed for his historical\naccuracy and dilligent research, Harris delivers a\nthriller and history lesson wrapped into one. Did\nyou know that there was a potato shortage across\nthe Germany occupied states towards the end of the\nwar, as so many had been taken to be distilled into\nrocket fuel? Facts are given throughout the novel,\nhighlightingtheattrocitiesoffamineandforcedlabour\ncommitted by the Axis powers even in their dying days.\nI\u2019ve certainly read better thrillers, though I\ndon\u2019t think there are many who would not enjoy\nsitting down and giving this tome a wide-eyed read.\nWhat we\u2019re reading next\nMark Sullivan Iain Pears Andrew Hunter Murray\nBooks\n\n"

    "content": "album, the nostalgia dripping from every song, as well\nas a bittersweet fondness for places and people who\u2019ve\nbeen and gone in the band members\u2019 lifetimes. Some\nhauntingly beautiful songs hidden in there.\nG_d\u2019s Pee AT STATE\u2019S\nEND! by Godspeed You!\nBlack Emperor\nIt\u2019s no secret to my\nfriends that I\u2019m just a slut\nfor post-rock. There are no\nsurprises then that I love\nthis record - not as much\nas some of the Canadian\ngroup\u2019s other releases, but it\u2019s still a spectacular record.\nThe mood traverses hope and optimism, and the gritty\nnihilism that the group have captured in previous\nrecords. It\u2019s the same kind of thing one expects from\na GY!BE record, but that\u2019s hardly a bad thing! A must\nfor post-rock fans.\nNew Long Leg by Dry\nCleaning\nI\u2019d never thought that\nI\u2019d laugh this much at\nan album; humour isn\u2019t\nsomething you often think\ntolinkwithmusic.Butwith\nDry Cleaning\u2019s vocalist,\nFlorence Shaw, leading us\non a snarky, sarcastic, and intimate journey through\nher mind \u00e0 la Fleabag, I always find myself chuckling\nalong to her dry, witty, spoken-word singing. Shaw\u2019s\ncomments about reverse-platform shoes or needing to\nbeweirdandhideforabitresonatewithmeplentytoo.\nAll in all, a fun and funny (yet still very human and\nemotional) album that\u2019s full of musical treats too!\nCalvacade by black midi\nThe first music I heard\nfrom Black Midi was a\nsingle from this album. It\nwas \u2018John L\u2019, and I loved it\nso goddamn much. I was\nso stoked for Calvacade,\nand the second single made\nme even more excited. The\nactual thing was nearly as good as I hoped, perhaps\nlet down by a few tracks in the second half, but still\na fantastic record, held high by the first 4 tracks. Had\nit been an EP, it might have been a perfect record, but\nwe\u2019ll settle for a very good LP instead.\nWhen You See Yourself by\nKings of Leon\nThis album is shifted in\nfocus, telling an intriguing\ncollection of unfamiliar\nstories with just the right\namount of familiarity\nin their voice and style\n(particularly \u2018Golden\nRestless Age\u2019, which brought back all the chills). It is\nmorewinding,lessexplosive,andIamsogladIlistened\nto it for the first time in the prime environment of a\nlate-night bus ride home.\nBlue Banisters by Lana\ndel Rey\nListening to Blue\nBanisters, this album\nfeels so immediately\nand obviously personal.\nUnlike many of Lana\u2019s\nprevious albums, Blue\nBanisters sheds that\ncertain intoxicated-summertime, femme-fatale-esque\npersona often associated with her. It delves into\nCOVID isolations, BLM protests, and bursts when I\nleast expected it.\nUntourable Album by\nMen I Trust\nThis album makes me\nwant to dress up to stay\nindoors on a foggy day,\nlie on the floor, and watch\nthe windows slowly steam\nup until the outside world\nis entirely blurred out. The\nband apparently (but cleverly) took advantage of the\npandemic situation, and purposely recorded the album\nwithout thinking of how to perform it live. Their\nusually heavy basslines are toned down, sharpness\nis muted, and tracks seem to play on in uniformity,\nenveloping times of solitude with layers upon layers of\ncomfort. Untourable Album was very much made for\nthis pandemic in every way possible.\nCINEMA by The Mar\u00edas\nAn absolute chef\u2019s\nkiss. This album feels\nseductive and comfortably\nambitiousbynature,butin\nno way can be generalised\nso. It fluctuates within\nand between songs, with\nvocals and instrumentals\nintermingling and constantly transitioning effortlessly,\nlike characters and plotlines in a movie. The first and\nlast tracks of CINEMA embody the album in an even\nmore vivid and creative near-cinematic experience \u2013\nalluding, atmospheric, poetic.\nHalf Drunk Under a Full\nMoon by The Fratelliss\nFrom the previous\noutwardly and flouncing\nstyle of Costello Music,\nHalf Drunk Under a Full\nMoon seems to convey\nmore of the band\u2019s\npersonal ideas. The album\ncontinuestheirsignaturestyleofbeingintenselycatchy\nand being \u2018predictable\u2019 in melodies, but is eclectic in\nstyle from song to song \u2013 pop, folk-rock, rockabilly.\nIn combination with new brass and string elements,\nand a higher relatability that can be felt through their\nlyrics, this album seems to be a product of creative\nexperimentation that could potentially pave the way\nfor the band to find their unique style.\nBy The Time I Get To\nPhoenix by Injury Reserve\nItisveryhardtodescribe\nthis one. The anguish,\nthe uncertainty, the pain\ninfused in this made up\nfor one of the deepest\nmusical experiences I have\never had. By the Time I Get\nto Phoenix was released one year after, but recorded\nbefore, the passing of one-third of the Arizonan trio,\nrapper Stepa J. Groggs. However, the project is not just\nan unintentional farewell letter, but one full essay on\nchallenges the human mind must face, whether it is\ngrief,depression,schizophrenia,orjustsimplepersonal\ngrowth. It is one heavy and potent listen.\nSometimes I Might Be\nIntrovert by Little Simz\nI already talked a bit\nabout Little Simz\u2019s latest\nalbum back in October,\nand it deserves to be\nmentioned again. The\ngrandiose instrumentals\nare some of the cleanest in\nhiphop,andtherappingispristine,withversatileflows\nand thought-provoking lines. Telling her life story, the\nrapper addresses themes that are extremely relevant\nin today\u2019s society, culminating in a strong message of\nblack feminism. Sometimes I Might Be Introvert is a\nconfident step forward for an artist that is building up\na massive wave. Give a listen to this accessible project\nand keep an eye out for her.\nTo See the Next Part of the\nDream by Parannoul\nParannoul is a one-person band from South\nKorea.Theybrokethrough\nalternative music circles\nwith this project, an hour-longemoalbumwithheavy\nshoegaze influence. The\nlyrics are (unsurprisingly) introspective and angsty, but\nsincere and absorbing. Indeed, the themes approached\narequiterelatableforayoungpublic,andalongsidethe\nthicklylayeredguitarsandkeys,theycreateanintimate\nand nostalgic atmosphere. It is an album that will make\nyou think of the past, as Parannoul pours their heart\nout about their deepest insecurities.\nFor the First Time by Black Country, New Road\nWiththereleaseoftheirdebutalbum,BlackCountry,\nNew Road became one of the most talked-about bands\nin the music world. The young group is bringing a\nrefreshing take on post-punk poetry, accompanied by\nintricate instrumentals \u2013 somehow making order out\nFRIDAY 7TH JANUARY 2022\n13\nMUSIC\nMusic.felix@imperial. ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nYunke Zhou\nKnows every word to every High School Musical song\nGiovanni Fran\u00e7a\nHis negative review made Coldplay announce retirement\n\n"

One thing is for sure.\nWhatever sound black midi explore explodes in the\nscene shortly after, just as they are about to move on\nandtraversenewsonicavenues.blackmidiarepioneers\nas ever.\nBlue Weekend by Wolf\nAlice\nIworrythatonedayWolf\nAlice will have a release\nthat I don\u2019t cherish as much\nas all their work so far.\nThis worry wasn\u2019t realised\nwith their third album,\nBlue Weekend, which is\nperhaps their most emotive work yet. The album feels\nlike a film soundtrack, ranging from introspective\nand anxious mutterings to explosive rock numbers. If\nyou are familiar with Wolf Alice\u2019s previous work you\nmay be surprised by how comparatively subdued Blue\nWeekendis,choosingtohighlightsingerEllieRowsell\u2019s\nmagnetic voice and evocative lyrics exploring different\nrelationships. I won\u2019t be getting my Wolf Alice tattoo\ncovered up any time soon.\nFor the First Time by Black\nCountry, New Road\nHailing from the\nsame Windmill circles as\nblack midi, 7-piece Black\nCountry, New Road\u2019s\nhighly anticipated debut\ndid not disappoint. They\nare a creative ensemble to\nsay the least, with saxophone and violin alongside a\ntraditional rock-band arrangement. For the First Time\nis an experimental and jazz-tinged reinvention of\ngenres such as post-punk and prog, featuring indulgent\ninstrumental passages throughout to highlight each\nmember of the band which perfectly complement\nfrontmanIsaacWood\u2019sbroodylyrics.Theirsophomore\nalbum,AntsfromUpThere,hasalreadybeenannounced\nfor February, and from the sound of the singles will be\non my 2022 version of this list.\nif we could make it go quiet\nby Girl in Red\nGirl in Red has been\nbreaking our hearts since\nshe released \u2018we fell in love\nin october\u2019 in 2018. With\nherdebutalbum,ifwecould\nmake it go quiet, she moves\naway from the bedroom\npop that brought her fame towards more indie synthpop sounds, reminiscent of beadadoobee. The album\ntraverses topics such as relationships, mental health,\nand queerness, displaying brutal honesty throughout.\n\u2018Serotonin\u2019 is the big track on this album, but my\npersonal favourite is the gentle \u2018.\u2019.\nTheworldwithinourbedroomsbyDrugStoreRomeos\nIncludingthisalbumfeelsalmostlikeacheat\u2013whilst\nit was released in 2021, I didn\u2019t actually get round to\nlistening to it until this week, and boy do I regret it.\nThe 15-track album is 48\nminutes of blissfully woozy\ntracks. The album isn\u2019t just\nethereal shoegaze tracks,\nwith the pace picking up\nslightly in \u2018Vibrate and\nthe Beach Fossils-esque\n\u2018Bow Wow\u2019, though the\nmood throughout the\nalbum is constant. You can picture every single track\non this album being performed by the 3-piece at the\nRoadhouse at the end of a Twin Peaks episode as the\ncredits start to roll. A dreamy glimpse into the minds\nof Drug Store Romeos, The world within our bedrooms\nmakes for a gorgeous listening experience.\nSometimes I Might Be\nIntrovert by Little Simz\nMaybe I\u2019m biased,\nbecause we\u2019re both\nLondoners, but I think\nwe\u2019re looking at one of\nthe greatest artists of a\ngeneration. Little Simz\nhas gone from strength to\nstrength,releasingStillnessinWonderland,GREYArea,\nandnow,SometimesIMightBeIntrovert,documenting\nher incredible growth as a female rapper. This album\nshoots up in production value \u2013 the dramatic orchestra\nmatches the intensity of her introspection, telling a\ncompelling story of evolution and identity. Simz\u2019s\ncharisma and talent shines in an unmistakeable labour\nof love. This is the kind of album you listen to from\nstart to finish. No skips.\nBlacktotheFuturebySons\nof Kemet\nAn album of unrelenting\nafrobeats for 51 minutes\nstraight, Sons of Kemet\nare at the top of their game\nand not afraid to show it.\nShabaka Hutchings and\nTheon Cross create this\nmagnetic dialogue between the saxophone and tuba\nthat is entirely unique. Kojey Radical has such an\nincredible feature on \u2018Hustle\u2019, it\u2019s one of the best tracks\non the album and maybe one of the best tracks of the\nyear. This group is one to watch. Pro tip: if you want to\nexperience them at their best, see them live.\nSmiling With No Teeth by\nGenesis Owusu\nIt\u2019s rare that a debut\nalbum from a relatively\nunknown artist smashes it\noutofthepark,butGenesis\nOwusu is absolutely a\nrarity. Smiling With No\nTeeth adamantly refuses\nto be boxed into a category. Its dizzying switching of\ngenresiseffortless,playful,andrefreshing.Reminiscent\nof artists like Thundercat, Owusu isn\u2019t afraid to make\nyou cackle with his lyrics either. My personal favourite:\n\u201cEvery day is a holiday if you can\u2019t tell the time\u201d. Words\nto live by.\nA Beginner\u2019s Mind by\nSufjan Stevens and Angelo\nDe Augustine\nSufjan Stevens\nknows exactly how to\nsimultaneously bathe you\nin warmth and make you\ncry. Stevens has absolutely\nfound his strength,\nwith soothing harmonies and lilting guitar riffs. A\nBeginner\u2019s Mind is a wonderful comfort in what has\nbeen a challenging year for many. Stevens\u2019 strength is\nin his story telling, which is present in the immense\nworld building of tracks like \u2018Lacrimae\u2019 and \u2018Olympus\u2019.\nThiscollaborationissoperfect,StevensandAngeloDe\nAugustine seem to be made for each other.\nThe House is Burning by\nIsaiah Rashad\nFrom The Sun\u2019s Tirade\nto The House is Burning,\nIsaiah Rashad\u2019s ability to\nsequenceanalbumremains\nfaultless. The transition\nfrom \u2018Headshots (4r Da\nLocals)\u2019 to \u2018All Herb\u2019 is\nso smooth it\u2019s mesmerising. Rashad\u2019s unmistakeable\ntalent shows in this album\u2019s hypnotic beats, incredible\nlyricism, and mellow atmosphere. The features blend\nseamlessly into his distinctive vibe; it really shows how\nclear Rashad\u2019s vision was here.\nFatigue by L\u2019Rain\nNew York musician Taja\nCheek outdid herself on\nher second record. This\nalbum deserves a review\nall by itself (maybe I\u2019ll get\nto it in the New Year!)\nbut for now, I\u2019ll settle for\nsaying that this album was\non repeat basically all summer. I was addicted to the\nstrange, flowing melodies with the thumping beat in\nthe background, the harsh cuts from song to song,\nand the warbling discomfort on certain tracks (I\u2019m\nlooking at you, \u2018Kill Self\u2019). Quite easily my favourite\nalbum of the year, even if\nit\u2019s relatively short.\nFlying Dream 1 by Elbow\nI already wrote about\nthis album a month or so\nago \u2013 my opinion hasn\u2019t\nreally changed all that\nmuch. The tl;dr is that I\nlove the homely feel of the\nBen Batemen\nSelf-described \u201cslut for post-rock\u201d\nPallavi Ojha\nInvented sad witch Autumn\n\n"
