Practising\nself-care is a key aspect to keeping\nyourself productive, motivated and\nhappy while on a busy schedule\nlike the one typically present at uni.\nSelf-care can be as small as trying to\naccept you needed more sleep when\nyou had that nap rather than being\nannoyed at yourself for not keeping\non working, or as large as deciding\nto set aside a few hours to make\nyourself a blanket fort and watch\na movie in it. It can be easy to get\nwrapped up in everything you need\nto get done, and it is hard to notice\nor accept when you really need a\nbreak. When you are feeling run\ndown, let yourself take some time\nout to look after yourself, because\nyou deserve it!\nWriting down some \u201crecipes\u201dfor\nself-care can help a lot, and can also\nserve as work-motivators because\nyou can give yourself a target and\nthen a self-care based reward\nafterwards. To get you started, here\nare some self-care \u201crecipes\u201d I like to\nuse, ranging from the simple to the\nlovely-yet-elaborate.\nRelaxing cinnamon and\nnutmeg drink\n1. Take your favourite mug and\nfill the kettle.\n2. Take a small teaspoon of\ncinnamon powder and a\nsmaller teaspoon of nutmeg\npowder/mace and put in mug,\nwith a generous squeeze of\nhoney.\n3. Fill mug up to halfway with\nboiled water and stir until the\nhoney, cinnamon and nutmeg\nare mixed in.\n4. Fill up the rest of the mug\nwith milk/milk substitute and\nstir again.\n5. Consume to your heart\u2019s\ncontent.\nThe blanket fortress\n1. Make a blanket fort using\nsofas, blankets, quilts, pillows\nand so on.\n2. Furnish blanket fort with soft\ntoys and fairy lights.\n3. Make a hot beverage and\nobtain some snacks e.g.\nSelf-care and looking after\nnumber one\npopcorn, chocolate bars,\nalmonds, crisps.\n4. Find some comforting music,\na book or a movie you love.\n5. If desired, grab a person to\ncuddle along with your soft-toys (OPTIONAL).\n6. Cuddle up in blanket fort with\nsoft toys/person and watch\nmovie or read while drinking\nyour drink and eating your\nsnacks.\n7. Continue until you feel\nslightly less icky.\nMovie time\n1. Get some popcorn of choice\n(can be any flavour or type)\nand a cup of your favourite\nbeverage.\n2. If you want to have a meal\ntoo, then prepare it (e.g. you\ncould make yourself a hotdog\nmeal to be extravagant,or your\nfavourite pasta bolognaise\netc).\n3. Pick your movie.\n4. Turn off the lights and make\na comfortable place to sit to\nwatch the movie - if desired,\nput on some fairy lights for an\natmospheric feel.\n5. Watch the movie and snack\ncontentedly!\nThis is what the FELIX office looks like. Not.

As machines\nand artificial intelligence begin to\npermeate every possible industry we\nwill soon see a workforce without\nwork; tomorrow\u2019s corporation will\nbe a human-free dystopia. It will\nbe faster and more efficient, free\nfrom the slow and unsteady hands\nof man. Society seems blind to this\ninescapable doom, and the one\nsolution that has been discussed, a\nuniversal basic income, is likely to\nface large opposition.\nThere is only one logical solution:\nmake man the machine. This is\nthe uncompromising vision that\nTomorrow Corporation presents.\nWe, as humans, must play an\nessential role in the future of\nautomation by becoming fully\nprogrammable and allowing\nmachines to dictate our lives, so\nwe can increase our efficiency\nbeyond all previous thresholds of\nman. Compare this to a universal\nbasic income which \u2013 within the\ncontext of a post-capitalist society\n\u2013 gives all citizens an unconditional\nsum of money. Without regular\nwork it\u2019s easy to imagine the entire\npopulation slowly devolving into a\ndemoralised mass of web-surfing\nsloths. The creative types among\nus would be complacent to believe\nthat they might be spared from\nthis potentially endless Netflix and\nchill.\nThe alternative, combining the\nmass factory work force of the past\nwith the precision and intelligence\nof modern technology, could lead\nat least lead to a society with some\nillusion of value and purpose.\nLuckily, there is actually a game\nunderneath Human Resource\nMachine\u2019s warped prediction of\nthe future, and it\u2019s pretty great.\nHaving previously developed Little\nInferno, World of Goo and the less\nwell known, but still excellent dual-screen puzzler, Henry Hatsworth,\nTomorrow Corporation are experts\nwhen it comes to designing\ninnovative puzzle mechanics.\nWhilst Little Inferno required the\nplayer to repeatedly buy and burn\nitems to progress, their newest\npuzzler tasks the player with\nautomating the actions of an office\nworker in order to solve increasingly\ncomplex problems.\nBest described as a programming\npuzzle game, a genre which has\nHuman Resource Machine is a big \u2018fuck you\u2019 to captialism. Photo Credit: Tomorrow Corporation\nCale Tilford\nMusic Editor\nTomorrow Corporation\u2019s prophetic puzzler paints a disturbing future for mankind\nWho knew programming could be this cute. Photo Credit: Tomorrow Corporation\nThere is\nonly\none logical\nsolution:\nmake man\nthe machine\nincreasingly found its way into\nthe mainstream with titles such as\nTIS-100 and Spacechem, Human\nResource Machine presents you with\na number of simple commands\n(with more added as the player\ncompletes each puzzle) which\nmust be ordered to create basic\nalgorithms. A small worker, whose\nappearance you choose at the\nstart of the game, proceeds to run\naround the room following each\ncommand in the player\u2019s solution.\nTwo conveyor belts, IN and OUT,\nrepresent the input and output of a\ncomputer, and a small area of tiles\non the floor represent its memory.\nThe jump command is essential\nin allowing players to create loops\nof computation to be applied to\neach input. Throughout forty or so\nlevels, the game provides a basic\nintroduction to assembly-like\nprogramming. As a Computing\nstudent, the majority of the game\nprovided little challenge, but there\nwere some puzzles later on in the\ngame that momentarily caused me\nto question my degree choice. So\nit\u2019s easy to imagine that players with\nlittle programming experience will\nfind the game frustratingly difficult.\nThere are a number of optional levels\n(which are substantially harder) and\noptimisation challenges, offering a\ngreater challenge to more capable\nplayers. No matter what your skill\nlevel, it\u2019s incredibly satisfying to\nwatch as your worker speeds around\nthe screen upon correctly solving a\npuzzle.\nWhen it\u2019s not warning us of our\nimpending doom, Human Resource\nMachine is also a satirical take on\nthe modern workplace. Each level\nrepresents a year in the life of your\nwith oversized heads contrast\nthe backdrops constructed\nfrom distorted monochrome\nphotographs. It will be instantly\nfamiliar to those who have played\nany of Tomorrow Corporation\u2019s\nprevious games, although this time\nA satirical\ntake\non the\nmodern\nworkplace\nworker as you slowly climb the\ncorporate ladder or in this case,\nelevator. By the game\u2019s end (and\nabout 40 years of work) your worker\nhas visually aged with grey hair and\nwrinkles,a comment on the millions\nstuck in the same corporation for\ntheir entire life. The level select\nscreen emulates the floor selection\npanel of a lift with not so frequent\ncoffee breaks indicated between\nlarge sets of levels. By revealing\nmore about the world in these\nshort and ambiguous cut-scenes,\nthe developers are able to capture\nthe painful crawl towards the next\nmoment of respite in the lives of\noffice workers.\nAll of this is presented in\nwarped cartoonish style; workers\nthey have gone for a slightly darker\npalette - a mixture of dreary greys\nand greens that perfectly match the\ngame\u2019s bleak outlook. The music\nfrom Kyle Gabler is surprisingly\nupbeat, taking inspiration from the\nmodern electronica scene. Sonically,\nit\u2019s similar to his previous work on\nWorld of Goo, easily one of 2008\u2019s\nmost memorable soundtracks.\nIf for a moment you ignore\nits deep and prophetic themes,\nthe enjoyment a player gets out\nof Human Resource Machine\nwill ultimately depend on their\nfamiliarity (or lack of) with\nassembly programming. It\u2019s as\nunwelcoming to non-programmers\nas the future is to those who aren\u2019t\nmade from metal.\nOut now on Steam\n\n"

I mean,\nfine, it\u2019s not your credit card, and it\u2019s\ntypically the most expensive item on\nthe menu, so surely you\u2019re getting\nyour money\u2019s worth? You certainly\nwouldn\u2019t pay that much when you\ngo out on a cheeky date to Nando\u2019s,\nbut that\u2019s different; this is a time\nto treat yourself. It\u2019s not like you\u2019re\nmissing out on anything else on\nthe menu \u2013 who really knows what\nhalf of it is anyhow? Foams, airs,\ndeconstructions: all are meaningless\nwhen you know exactly how juicy,\nmeaty and delicious that steak\nwill be. It\u2019s a safe choice. But, ask\nyourself - what am I really getting\nthat I can\u2019t do myself?\nIs it the meat? Well, maybe.\nKitchens have access to some better\nquality meat than you might pick up\nfrom many of the lower end shelves\n(and sorry, but Tesco\u2019s Finest doesn\u2019t\nreally cut it), but lots of the meat\ncounters at many a supermarket\nnow stock some very good meat: dry\naged,well marbled,and cut properly.\nAnd free range, higher welfare\nchicken is now standard, along with\nWelsh lamb and heritage pork.Fine,\nit\u2019s not the cheapest by far, but I\u2019m\nrooting for quality over quantity.\nIs it the accompaniments?\nPerhaps the lack of sauce B\u00e9arnaise\nis what\u2019s held you back last year, so\nit\u2019s only fair to treat yourself to that,\nthe triple cooked chips, and a token\nrocket salad.\nOr is it actually the skill \u2013 the fact\nthat you just get to sit there, idly\nswirling your Chianti (just like at the\nwine tasting your friend at Durham\ntook you to) and chatting about\nthe latest batch of freshers, whilst\npointedly avoiding all conversation\nabout your own degree, before a\nsteak appears, cooked just the way\nyou like it. Of course, that\u2019s medium\nrare; you have to show yourself off\nas a real connoisseur in front of your\nparents, so they see how well you\u2019re\nmaturing at uni. Besides, it\u2019s how he\norders it on Man vs Food, so it must\nbe the best way, right?\nLet\u2019s cut to the chase: you\u2019re\nordering it because you hate cooking\nexpensive cuts of meat at home.\nI used to. Spending \u00a310 on a nice\nsteak, only to have a crisis moment\nwhen it comes to actually cooking\nthe beast. But let\u2019s break it down,\nand dispel a few myths along the\nway. This isn\u2019t my own investigation\n\u2013 far from it,it comes from the chefs\nI\u2019ve worked with, as well as some\nof the excellent literature available\nonline that explores the world of\nscientific cooking.\nHow do you take it?\nFor a start, what do we mean\nwhen we say \u201cmedium rare\u201d so\nproudly to the waiter \u2013 as if they\ninsult you for assuming you might\nhave it any other way?! Well, as a\nscientific institution, we should take\nan objective stance \u2013 medium rare\nis 57\u00b0C. Nothing to do with how\nit feels compared to the palm of\nyour hand, or anything to do with\nhow long you cooked it for on one\nside, or even if you brought it out\nof the fridge an hour before cooking\n\u2013 this is simple fact, temperature\ndetermines doneness. So how do\nyou tell?\nWell, spend \u00a312 on Amazon, and\nyou can get a digital instant meat\nthermometer. Basically a metal\nprobe with a thermocouple inside,\nit takes a reading in seconds, and\nyou get to know exactly when your\nmeat is just so. 53\u00b0C for rare, 65\u00b0C\nfor medium (for beef at least. All\nthe other temperatures you can find\nonline). Life is so much easier now!\nIs this thing on?\nBut how do you get to that lovely\ntemperature? Is it all about the white\nhot coals in a disposable barbecue,\nor maybe the lovingly passed down\ncast iron pan from gran? Again, let\u2019s\nhave a think.\nUnless you\u2019re dealing with very\ncheap steaks, yours should be a nice,\nthick cut piece of meat, and I\u2019m\ntalking 1 inch at the very least! It\u2019s\nwhy meat counters tend to be better\nfor them: you can get them cut to\nsize. Cooking for one? Ask for a\nthick piece from the scrag end, and\nget a slightly narrower cut. Stay at\nhome date? Share a steak. You just\nwant a nice thick piece of meat in\nyour mouth at the end of the day. I\nmean, who doesn\u2019t?\nBut, with the laws of\nthermodynamics (which, as a\nBiochemistry student, I\u2019m not\ngoing to attempt to understand) in\nmind, having a flaming hot grill is\nthe worst thing we can do. By the\ntime the heat has spread through\nthe steak, and you\u2019ve taken your\ncareful temperature reading, the\noutside will resemble the charcoal\nyou\u2019re cooking over \u2013 well past the\ngolden brown caramelised sear we\nwant. So you switch to the pan, and\nagain, it\u2019s just too hot! There will\nbe a nice grey band of overcooked\nmeat around the edge, with a tinge\nof pink in the centre. Fine, you can\nlabour over it for hours with a lot of\nbutter, patience and constant (every\n30 seconds) flipping, but that\u2019s far\ntoo much work for a busy student,\nright?\nNaturally, you can do all sorts of\nthings: leaving the meat out to get to\nroom temperature (which actually\ntakes well over 4 hrs, not exactly\nspeedy), only flipping it once (how\ncould that ever help even heating?)\nand a myriad other supposed tricks\nto get your meat to cook better,\nvery few of which have any sort of\nscientific grounding, and even fewer\nof which work.\nLet\u2019s get technical\nSo, let\u2019s rewind: how to get\nsomething to that perfect\ntemperature? Well,if I was to run an\nexperiment in the lab,I\u2019d use a water\nbath, which is exactly what many\nmodern chefs have turned to, in the\nform of sous-vide cooking. But the\ngadgetry is far too much money \u2013\nJust like at\nthe wine\ntasting\nyour friend\nat Durham\ntook you\nto\nSanjay Bhattacharya\nWriter\nReverse-searing is the the most impressive way to cook a steak on a student budget\nIt\u2019s how he\norders it\non Man vs\nFood, so\nit must be\nthe best\nway, right?\nwe\u2019re looking to use the minimums\nsupplied in student halls.\nWhy not instead of using water,\nusing air as your cooking medium?\nThat\u2019s how a regular oven works,and\nso that\u2019s the secret: cook your steaks,\nand all your nice thick cuts of meat,\nin the oven first. But not too hot \u2013\nyou\u2019re going to have the oven set at\nthe lowest it can go (most should\ndo about 100\u00b0C, but the lower you\ncan go the better), so that the meat\nwarms up slowly. It can take up to 2\nhours for a particularly thick steak,\nbut in that time, you can be doing\nanything. Just check it after half an\nhour and watch as the temperature\nrises. It couldn\u2019t be simpler than\nthat!\nSear it up\nNow that you\u2019ve taken your\nperfectly cooked steak out of the\noven, you could just dive in \u2013 but\nit hasn\u2019t got any of that beautiful\ncrust. That\u2019s ok \u2013 fire up that grill\nor heat a pan on the hob until it\nsmokes when oil is added, and\nquickly brown the outside of the\nsteak, flipping regularly so you don\u2019t\nburn any spots. Or put it under the\nhottest grill your oven can manage,\nand watch it carefully. Now, that\u2019s\nhow meat should be. You\u2019ve just\ncompleted your first reverse sear!\nNamed as such because unlike\nnormally, the sear came last.\nThe above also applies to chops\nof all kinds, whole and jointed fowl,\nand large roasts \u2013 slow, low heat to\nbring up to temperature followed by\na brief trip to hell to crisp.Take your\npick of meat, and enjoy!\nYou don\u2019t have to serve it on a slate, but it does help.

Creeping into Metric on\nthe first Monday of term you would\nhave been pleasantly surprised.\nInstead of the bass and sweat combo\nusually found in the infamous\nnightclub one would have found\na delightful and civilised stand up\ncomedy night entertaining freshers\nand (brave) returning students.\nOkay I was joking, it wasn\u2019t\ncivilised at all. Comedy, guys!\nThe night kicked off with some\nobservational comedy from Carl\nDonnelly, gently warming up the\naudience with his natural story\ntelling ability. After the interval,\nthe audience returned to their seats\nwith apparent eagerness, maybe\nbecause Imperial\u2019s own comedian\nand president of Imperial Comedy,\nArran Hobson-Sayers, was about to\ntake centre stage. Or maybe it was\nbecause of the beer.\nArran welcomed the freshers in\ntrue Imperial style by giving them\nadvice on the wild nights that they\nwould surely experience under the\nUnion\u2019s rigorous social calendar.\nHowever, Arran later warned about\nthe consequences of such drunken\nadventures, stating \u201c...it\u2019s all good\nuntil you wake up and Mary Berry\nis in the bed beside you\u201d.\nIf you ask me, that just makes it\nbetter.Afterthethunderousapplause\ndied down,the next comedian made\nhis way to the stage. Andrew Watts\nelectrified the audience pouring out\nemotional mid-life crisis stories. Of\ncourse, being students, none of us\ncould relate. But what the hell, we\nlaughed anyway. Anticipation was\nthen rife for the arrival of Hasan\nAl-Habib, perhaps Imperial\u2019s most\nfamed comedian. He comically\ndescribed his long and arduous\njourney, fighting against all odds to\nescape Birmingham to the salvation\nthat is Imperial College London.\nThe headliner for the evening was\n\u2018French\u2019 comedian Marcel Lucont,\nwho decided to teach the students\nin the room a thing or two about life\nin the wider world. Dryly delivering\nbawdy wit he reduced the audience\nto boyish giggles (you know who\nyou are) as he made his way through\na collection of meticulous sex\npoetry. And so, the first comedy\nnight of the year came to a close.\nBut it would not be too long before\nanother venue opened its doors to\nthe unique humour of Imperial\nComedy.\nThe dimly lit basement known to\nThe most fun you\u2019ll see people having in Metric any time soon Photo Credit: Imperial College Union\nPeter Munton\nWriter\nComedy Society cracks up campus\nOur very own Imperial comedians are bringing LOLs to Metric\nCOMPANY PRESENTATION\nROYAL SCHOOL OF MINES BUILDING, IMPERIAL COLLEGE\nLECTURE THEATRE 1.31 \u2013 LEVEL 1\nTUESDAY 27TH OCTOBER\n6.30PM FOR A 7PM START\nTo attend please register via JobsLive\nDISCOVER\nOUR WORLD\nGet therefaster\nOliver Wyman is a leading global management consulting firm that combines deep industry knowledge with\nspecialised expertise in strategy, operations, risk management, and organisation transformation.

Not\nwasting any of the postgrads\u2019\nprecious time, the first set was\ndelivered by comedian Matthew\nOsborn, keeping his comic timing\non point. Up next was yours truly (I\nwon\u2019t go into detail here).\nLosing his stand up virginity\nAkash Jyoti then took to the stage,\napprehension was present in the\nroom. Akash then unfurled a kooky\nand eccentric performance bringing\nunconventional energy to the bar.\nThe audience laughed throughout\na first performance worthy of note.\nFollowing on from Imperial\nComedy was Shazia Mirza, who\ndispatched brusque one-liners,\none after the other. Particularly\nengaging the (few) female postgrads\nin the room she whipped everyone\nup into an outburst of laughter.\nThe last spot saw comedian and\nsex symbol Earl Okin headline the\nshow. Hugely musically talented on\nguitar, he erotically made his way\nthrough an assortment of songs\nwith heavy sexual innuendoes\nthroughout.

Sounds\ndramatic, but the Global Goals for\nSustainable Development are the\nnew benchmark to measure our\nprogress as a species for the next 15\nyears; and it turns out the scientific\ncommunity may be the key to\nunlocking such high ambitions.\nMadeleine Webb\nWriter\nWomen are needed to increase productivity\nWhile some goals are explicitly\nlinked to research \u2013 climate change,\nsustainable energy and clean water\n\u2013 two targets could find less obvious\ncommon ground in STEM circles.\nThose being Goal 2: Zero Hunger\nand Goal 5: Gender Equality.\nAlthoughtherelationshipbetween\nSTEM and feminism throughout\nhistory has been complicated, to put\nit kindly,new data shows that the pay\ngap is narrowing, even if progress is\nadmittedly slow.The key problem is\nnow seen to be encouraging women\ninto STEM careers. It\u2019s a common\nR\neports dooming the\nEarth as we know it are\nnot novel concepts. For\nall the much needed\nscaremongering in the media,\nclimate change as a threat sits on a\npedestal. It\u2019s a threat that respects\nno boundaries, operating across all\nborders. However it\u2019s only recently\nthat the financial repercussions of\nsuch a crisis have started stepping\ninto the mainstream.\nCompanies and investors are\nrealising that any inconvenient\nexpenditures to reduce the effects\nof climate change now will provide\nfinancial benefits in the future.\nScience and our economy should not\nbe considered as separate entities but\nas two parts of a dynamic system.\nThis was stressed by Mark Carney,\ngovernor for the Bank of England,\nat the Lloyds leading insurers\ngathering earlier this year.\nCarney emphasised how a\npotential economic crash poses\na huge threat as insurers invest\nheavily in fossil fuel assets, likely\nto be rendered worthless under the\neffects of climate change.A fourfold\nincrease in losses related to extreme\nweather events in the last thirty\nyears has already been recorded.\nAt present it is considered too\nexpensive for companies using oil,\ncoal and gas to invest in alternative\nenergy sources. Infrastructure to\nextract fossil fuels is already there,\nthe investment has already been\nmade.It is a huge risk for companies\nto disregard these current assets\nwhen the future of renewable\nenergy sources and their economic\nsuccess is unknown.\nHowever,as more money is poured\ninto these technologies, the price\nwill decline. Competition between\ncompanies will result in demand to\nproduce renewable energy at a lower\nprice. The only thing needed is that\ninitial investment, to kick-start the\nrenewables industry.\nGovernmental bodies have this\nkick-starting ability. With the EU\ntargeting to limit global warming\nat 2 degrees from pre-industrial\nlevels, it is counter-intuitive for\nthe UK government to cut funding\nobservation, even sort of a running\njoke, that Imperial \u201chas no girls\u201d, a\nstatement that all too often extends\ninto the wider world of research.\nWomen in the UK fill only 9% of\nnon-medical STEM posts and this\nis a problem, not just for equality\nbut for science itself.\nThese issues have been thrust back\ninto the spotlight over the weekend\ndue to the Borlaug Dialogue\nconference, which focuses on food\nsecurity in the developing world.The\nBorlaug convention created waves\nthis year when the central message\nemerging from the discussions had\nan unexpected emphasis on the\nneed for female researchers.\nThe convention wasn\u2019t all talk\nwhen it came to including women\neither, with 3 key heavyweight\nfemale speakers including Chelsea\nClinton the Vice Chairwoman\nof the Clinton Foundation and\nFlorence Chenoweth, the Minister\nof Agriculture for Liberia. This\nwasn\u2019t framed as an issue of political\ncorrectness but instead a matter\nvital to achieving the \u201cZero Hunger\u201d\ngoal set for 2030, perhaps one of the\nmost ambitious targets on the list.\nThe UN\u2019s Food and Agriculture\nOrganization (FAO) have collected\nThe UN Assembly Hall, where the magic happens Photo Credit: Wikipedia\nIt is as\nmuch about\ninstitutional\ntransformation\nas it is about\ninvesting in\nindividuals\ndata showing that disadvantages for\nwomen in agriculture also include a\nlack of opportunities that drag down\nthe efficiency of the whole system.\nAs the FAO\u2019s official statement\nexplained, \u201cif women had the same\naccess to productive resources as\nmen, they could increase yields on\ntheir farms by 20-30%\u201d.\nAccording to World Food\nProgramme, if there were equal\nopportunities for farmers the\nnumber of undernourished people\nin the world would decrease by\n150 million people. Developing\nMoney is green? Bank of England in awe\nfor renewable energies. Lacking\nsupport, it is not surprising that the\n\u201cevil\u201d oil companies are doing little\nto change their main energy source.\nHowever, small steps are being\ntaken. Shell has predicted that by\n2050 oil and gas will still play a\ncentral role, but this will plateau\nby 2100. As a company, it aims\nto meet the 2 degree target and is\nslowly investing more to have a\nfuture that works with nature for a\nsustainable energy supply. All that\u2019s\nneeded is other companies, such as\nExon,to be convinced that a greener\napproach will benefit the company\neconomically in the future.\nAlthough there is no silver bullet\nsolution, a lack of funding by\ngovernmental bodies is a limiting\nfactor to the growth of renewables.\nWithout public demand, it is\nunlikely that governments will\naspire to invest in such bodies, and\nsuch demand is in turn unlikely to\npresent itself, when the result will\nprobably be tax increases.\nIt is ultimately a vicious cycle,\ncontrolled by profit and power.\nThe public does not care enough to\ninvest, thus the politicians similarly\nlack interest.The public will not care\nuntil the effects are immediate and\nthis lack of immediacy ultimately\nfuels our complacency towards\nclimate change.\nJane Courtnell\nScience Editor\nMark Carney: Big money, big... ego Photo Credit: Wikipedia\ncountries, where an estimated 13%\nof the population goes hungry,\nwould benefit the most from such\nmeasures.\nSo the question remains: if an\nincreased female presence is what\u2019s\nneeded how do we achieve that? The\nsolution presented by the director\nof African Women in Agricultural\nResearch and Development, Dr.\nWanjiru Kamau-Rutenberg, is a\ndifficult one: change the culture of\nscientific research. She stated the\ngoal is \u201cas much about institutional\ntransformation as it is about\ninvesting in individuals\u201d.\nA problem this complex needs\nto be address on multiple levels if\nmeaningful change is to happen. A\nwide range of measures to improve\nconditions of maternity leave, equal\npay and encouraging interest from a\nyoung age are essential for success.\nScientific culture does have\nat least one thing going for it\nthough; science likes to aim high.\nIn all likelihood not all the Global\nGoals will be met by 2030, but by\ncontinuing these discussions the\nresearch community can make more\nof an impact on more sources of\ninequality than they could have ever\npredicted.\n\n"

With that in\nmind, I don\u2019t know what \u201ccharacter\u201d\nthe match official selection\ncommittee is trying to build with its\nstatement on the controversial final\ncall in that game. For those of you\nwho haven\u2019t read it, the statement\nreads that \u201cthe appropriate decision,\ntherefore, should have been a scrum\nto Australia for the original knockon\u201d and not the penalty which\nultimately proved the difference\nbetween the two sides. I cannot\nhelp but feel that World Rugby has\nthrown Craig Joubert under the bus\nwith this statement.\nWhat is the point of this\nstatement? Is it for aspiring referees\nto remember at some point in their\nfuture? If so, their various regional\nand national associations can pass\nthis down to them. Is this a pseudo-apology to the Scottish players and\nmanagement? If so, speak to them\nprivately about the matter. The only\npurpose I can see is to shift the blame\non to Craig Joubert for the decision.\nIf this is the route we are now\ngoing down, I invite World Rugby\nto provide us with an opinion on\nevery penalty given (and not given)\nduring a game.Perhaps at the end of\nthe tournament we would then have\na lovely table of could haves and\nwould haves. Yes the link between\nthis last minute penalty and the\nfinal result is obviously clearer, but\nin reality it counted no more or less\nthan any of the preceding points.\nAs will have been drilled into\nevery rugby player from the moment\nthey picked up the ball, the referee\nis always right, even when they are\nwrong.

The\nreferee has to make this call in real\ntime, and as I was watching live I\nimmediately thought that it was\na penalty. There will be many who\nargue that the referee should have\nbeen able to refer to the Television\nMatch Official (TMO) on this call.\nHow many decisions are we going\nto refer if this becomes the norm?\nIs it any penalty decisions with 5\nminutes left on the clock, with 10\nminutes? Indeed, what about all the\npenalties that aren\u2019t given? In many\nrucks there are moments where\nsome referees would call holding\non, while others would give a split\nsecond longer. Should the TMO\nbe watching for all of these in the\nlast few minutes? It simply does not\nproduce a workable game if we go\ndown the route of assessing these\nkinds of penalty decisions.\nFor any fans holding a grudge, the\nwrong call was made at the lineout.\nExecute your set piece correctly and\ntake the referee out of the equation.\nThe reality is that Scotland were one\nsuccessful lineout from a World Cup\nSemi Final.Ultimately,for the game\nJonny Pratt\nWriter\nCraig Joubert sprints off the field at the end of a thrilling, but controversial, game\nat Twickenham on Sunday.

The trip to\nthe College was part of a four\nday visit to the UK, which was\nthe first state visit by a Chinese\nleader in ten years. In addition to\nvisiting Imperial, the President also\nmet with Prime Minister, David\nCameron in an extremely important\nmeeting regarding the building of a\nnew power plant at Hinkley Point,\nSomerset. Whilst in the UK he is\na guest of the Queen, residing at\nBuckingham Palace.\nImperial and China have very\nstrong connections,which is why the\nPresident and the Chinese Embassy\nwere so keen for the visit to happen.\nIn addition to the amazing Chinese\nstudent population at Imperial,there\nare also many Chinese researchers\nworking in the College, and\nImperial collaborates with Chinese\npartners working on cutting edge\nresearch. The key focus of the visit\nwas the announcement of a series\nof new Imperial-China education\nand research collaborations, which\nwill benefit both Chinese students\nwanting to come to Imperial who\nwill now have access to more\nscholarships, and the research\ncommunity in terms of funding for\nImperial PhD students to study in\nChina and research grants.\nThe President and the First\nLady, Madam Peng, were greeted\nupon their arrival to the College\nby His Royal Highness the Duke\nof York, who then introduced\nthem to Imperial\u2019s President Alice\nGast, Provost James Stirling,\nand Chancellor of the Exchequer\nGeorge Osborne. They were also\npresented with flowers by Union\nPresident Lucinda Sandom-Allum,\nand GSU President Luicheng Guo.\nAlice Gast then welcomed the\nPresident and the First Lady to\nImperial with a short speech,\nhighlighting strong links between\nImperial and China, and the\nbenefits to both parties. She hoped\nImperial could become \u201cChina\u2019s\nbest academic partner in the West\u201d.\nIt was\na huge\nhonour\nto shake\nhands\nwith the\nPresident!\nFollowing the speech, the\nPresident and the rest of the\ndelegation were given a tour of\nsome of the research that really\nhighlights the College\u2019s relationship\nwith China. Firstly, he visited the\nData Science Institute, which is\ndirected by Professor Yike Guo,\nand the Hamlyn Institute, directed\nby Professor Guang-Zhong Yang.\nBoth of these institutes will benefit\nfrom a new \u00a33 million grant by the\nChina UCF group to fund research.\nOn the tour he was presented with\nexamples of research from both\ninstitutions, including a data-driven\nanalysis of the political and social\nimpact of China\u2019s \u201cOne Belt, One\nRoad\u201d policy, and technological\ninnovations in medical robotics that\nhave revolutionised healthcare.\nFinally, President Xi met some\nstudents of the College, and\nexchanged a few words with\neach of them. This gave him the\nopportunity to ask what life was\nlike at Imperial, both in terms of\nacademics and activities outside\nthe classroom, including College\nfunded expeditions and heading the\nStudent Union.\nIt was a huge honour to shake\nhands with the President!\nCanweignorehumanrightsabusesinChina?\nAre we supporting suffering by allying ourselves academically?\nSimran Kukran\nWriter\nA\nccording to the College\nwebsite, we are the UK\u2019s\nnumber one research\npartner with China. In\na speech welcoming Xi Jinping,\nProfessor Alice Gast, president of\ntheuniversity,said\u201cbrilliantstudents\nand academic collaborations are\nmaking both the UK and China\nstronger, more prosperous and ready\nto deal with the challenges of this\ncentury\u201d. Surely these challenges of\nthe century should include opposing\ninequality, imprisonment without\ntrial and the persecution of ethnic\nminorities?\nGoogle \u2018Chinese President\u2019 and\nbefore long you\u2019ll be greeted with\na whole host of human rights\nabuses. Amnesty International has\nsaid that the authorities \u201cseverely\nrestrict freedom of expression\u201d, and\nhave criticised China for harassing,\ndetaining and torturing activists\nand their families. For example,\nsince president Xi Jinping has come\nto power, eleven women\u2019s rights\nactivists have been imprisoned,\ndespite the president hosting the\nUN World Conference on Women\njust three weeks ago.\nGeorge Osborne, the Chancellor\nof the Exchequer, accompanied the\npresident on his visit. He has been\npraised by Chinese state media\nfor \u201cnot stressing human rights\u201d\nand focussing instead on business\npotential. He\u2019s said he wants the\nUK to \u201cstick together [with China]\nand make a golden decade for both\nour countries\u201d. Although economic\ngrowth in China has slowed, it\nstill accounts for about 25% of all\nglobal growth, which is why he\nwants China to be the UK\u2019s second\nbiggest trading partner by 2020. As\nChina\u2019s economy transitions, there\nis an opportunity for British firms\nto provide financial services which\nthe UK specialises in exporting.\nThe benefits for the country (and\nuniversity) in collaborating with\nChina are clear. It was announced\nthis week that more of the best\nChinese students will be given\nstate scholarships to study here, and\nsupport will be given to Imperial\u2019s\nPhD students to study at Chinese\nUniversities. I am honoured to be\npart of a diverse student body and\nthe idea of more people having\naccess to the world-class education\navailable here is something that\nmakes me feel proud.It is wonderful\nthat Imperial students will be given\nthe opportunity to study in China.\nI just hope that this does not mean\nwe benefit from an alliance where\nour partner is responsible for stifling\nfree speech and disrespecting its\ncitizens.\nImperial experts and their\nChinese partners are working\ntogether on cutting-edge research\nin fields including nanotechnology,\nbioengineering, computing,\nadvanced materials, environmental\nengineering and public health.\nResearch in these fields will\nhas already made a difference \u2013\nimproving the quality of life for\npeople worldwide. Does turning a\nblind eye to the state of affairs in the\ncountry we are allied with mean we\nthat are inadvertently fuelling the\nabuse suffered by so many? Can we\ndivorce ourselves from this state of\naffairs and just focus on the science?\nA girl can dream.\nXi Jinping is in the UK as a guest of\nthe Queen. Photo Credit: AOL\n\n"

Almost certainly more than\nyou think. For example, the Duke\nof Kent and the Princess Alexandria\n(34th\nand 49th\nin line to the throne,\nas of May 2015) are considered\nworking royals and receive a 24\nhour security detail from the\nMetropolitan Police.\nSince 2013, the royalty have\nbeen removed from the Civil List\n(of people kept by the State) and\ninstead get a single payment from\nthe Sovereign Support Grant,\nwhich is around 15% of the financial\ntakings of the two Royal Duchies\n(the Queen and Prince Charles)\nplus other royal holdings, on which\nno tax is paid.\nControversially, should the\nfinancial situations of the Duchies\nworsen, the amount paid per annum\nthrough the Sovereign Support\nGrant is protected and can only rise\nover time.\nWhile the introduction of the\nSovereign Support Grant has\nremoved the issue (to some extent)\nof categorising which royals are\nconsidered to be \u201cworking\u201d and\ntherefore are on the Civil List, it\nalso appears to have allowed the\nKeeper of the Privy Purse (in charge\nof the financial management of the\nroyalty) to take part in some quite\nshameless spin.\nFor example, the figure paid\nthrough the Sovereign Support\nGrant for 2015-2016 will be around\n\u00a340 million, which one could argue\nis a relatively small price to pay\nfor the tourism money, soft power,\nand warm fuzzy glow of patriotism\nwe all occasionally (yes, even me)\nfeel when we think of our long-established monarchy. It allows very\npositive comparisons to other states\nwith intact monarchies and even to\na handful of states with an elected\nhead (see Italy). However, this\nfigure pales in comparison to even a\nconservative estimate of the full cost\nof maintaining our monarchy.\nFor example, regardless of the\nreform of the Civil List system,\nmany minor and even obscure\nmembers of the royal family receive\nAs symbolic\nas the royal\nfamily may\nbe, they\nshould be\ndeposable\nEamonn Postlethwaite\nColumnist\npolice protection at the expense of\nthe London Metropolitan Police.\nThe budget (as obfuscated as it is, it\nseems that revealing the cost of royal\nsecurity is in itself a security breach)\nputs the most comprehensive\nestimate of the cost of protection\nfor all royals who receive it has\nbeen put at \u00a3100 million, a figure\nthat already dwarfs the Sovereign\nSupport Grant.\nWhen all the ancient and\nobscure, modern and hidden, and\notherwise generally unknown costs\nof the royal family are added up,\nthe pressure group Republic (which\nmay be biased, but the report is very\nwell made) estimates the true cost\nto the British Tax Payer (including\nrevenues from the treasury and\nthose that would otherwise be\ncollected by the treasury) as \u00a3334\nmillion.\nThere was a popular figure of\n\u00a3500 million said to be brought in\nby the royal family through tourism\nthat was produced by VisitBritain.\nThis, if true, would more than allay\nthe financial arguments above.\nHowever the reader might be\ninterested to note that this is simply\na quarter of the figure they judged\nwas due to \u201cBritish Culture and\nHistory attracting tourists\u201d. I don\u2019t\nreally want to start on why such an\nestimate is flawed.\nAdded to this, the bizarre legal\nentities that are the Duchies, with\ntheir tax exemption and legal\nprivileges that would make any true\nbeliever in a free market and/or\ndemocracy wince, add to the feeling\nthat all might not be quite as good\nvalue for money as the Privy Purse\nmakes it seem.\nMany more issues spring to mind,\nonce the question is asked. Prince\nCharles\u2019 little spiders make it clear\nhe hasn\u2019t the restraint of his mother\nwhen it comes to the separation of\npolitics and the monarchy. Prince\nHarry makes you wonder whether\nthe monarchy might always be such\nwell respected ambassadors around\nthe world for these blessed lands,\nas unlikely it is that he\u2019ll ever be\ncrowned.\nIndeed I am not bothered that the\nQueen has such political clout, but\nI feel that if the head of state of my\ncountry embarrasses, misrepresents\nor stands opposed to my view of\nthe world (and a sufficiently sized\ngroup of others\u2019), as symbolic as the\nroyal family may be, they should be\ndeposable.\nHow long before the monarchy\nstops being seen as a beautiful and\nrespected remainder of a bygone\nage and starts being laughed at\nanachronism in a world slowly\nmoving towards democracy? Kudos\nto Prince Andrew for doing good\nwork, but I\u2019d much rather you were\njust an ordinary bloke.\nTheir tax\nexemption\nand legal\nprivileges\nwould make\nany believer\nin the free\nmarket\nwince\nHating on Graduation is hard\nThe Angry Grad\nColumnist\nG\nraduation day. Supposed\nto be a milestone, right?\nOne of the happiest\ndays of your lives, some\npeople (morons) say. Well, not if I,\nthe Angry Grad, have anything to\ndo with it.\nI was proper excited for it to be a\n\u2018mare, and my God did the day start\noff that way. I got stuck in traffic,\nlocked in toilets and stripped of my\ngown (who the FUCK designed\nthem to attach by Velcro? I couldn\u2019t\neven swing my cape around like\nHazza P without some sort of\ngown-related disaster).\nI was all set to miss frolicking\nacross the stage, and that really\nwould have made a fantastic rant.\nBut, alas, I made it and was ready to\npinpoint and critique all the flaws of\nG-DAY.\nWhilst, yes, if we were in the\nUSA, I would major in moaning,\nthere\u2019s no way I can fault the venue.\nIt pains me to praise, but it\u2019s gotta\nbe said: it doesn\u2019t get much better\nthan the Royal Albert Hall.\nThe grandiosity of the venue really\ndoes drive home the fact that you\ncan now put those three little letters\nafter your name, and at the end of\nthe day, I did achieve something\npretty special and unique \u2013 just like\nthe other 800+ people I graduated\nwith.\nThe RAH, as British as it may\nbe, cannot balance out the guju\ncommunity of ICL. I salute you,\nShahs, Patels and Chowdrys, for\nmaking my face crack a smile. Y\u2019all\njust kept appearing,like food at your\ngrandmother\u2019s house, and my God\ndo I love you for it.\nMoreover, instead of us Asians\nsticking out like sore thumbs with\nour names, which debatably were\ninvented on scrabble boards, the\nRobinsons and Smiths amongst the\ncrowd were the ones that shocked\nus.\nWe may have finished the\nceremony with God Save the\nQueen, but that didn\u2019t stop us from\nplaying Where\u2019s Wally with the\nwhite people before, during and\nafter.\nWhileIdidmoanaboutsocialising\nin my last column? Raving it up\nwith my homies at the reception\nwas pretty darn fun. I smashed\nmy fair share of champagne, had\none too many a photo shoot, and\ngenerally just jammed like the baller\nI am with my coursemates.\nIt was quite cathartic really, seeing\naswe\u2019llprobablyneverallbetogether\nagain \u2013 they\u2019ll be finding cures to\ncancer across the globe while I still\ncan\u2019t perfect rolling a round chapatti\n\u2013 so we did just savour the moment.\nI\u2019m not sure how to describe it, as\nit is an emotion I am unfamiliar\nwith, but I believe the common\nfolk call it \u2018being content\u2019. Even\nmy tutor pointed out that I came\nacross as overwhelmed, which made\nan amusing change to my usually\nunderwhelmed state. For those of\nyou yet to graduate: you have a lot\nto look forward to.\nI\u2019m gonna sign off \u2013 I\u2019m heaving\nand need a chunder because this\narticle is sickeningly sweet.I tried to\nhate on graduation,but I couldn\u2019t,so\nnow I hate myself.\nGraduation only disappoints by being difficult to find its flaws\nI didn\u2019t fall\non stage\n... and I did\nindeed look\npeng\nP.S. WTF was that weird drum\nbell thing on stage? Someone\nenlighten me via the Editor please.\nP.P.S. To those who read my\nlast column: I didn\u2019t fall on stage\n(unfortunately, no one did), and I\ndid indeed look peng. DOUBLE\nWIN.\nThe modern-day hypocrite\nJennifer Eden\nWriter\nT\nhe inner hypocrite has\nbeen lurking within\nyou for some time.\nOccasionally it appears\nin its most obvious form, whereby\nsaid hypocrite exclaims, \u201cI don\u2019t\nwatch trash TV,\u201d and then binge\nwatches 20 episodes of Keeping up\nwith the Kardashians. Of course,\n\u201cI only watched it to see what all\nthe fuss was about\u201d. Sadly, not\nfooling anyone. However, generally\nspeaking a hypocrite can take many\nforms.\nThere\u2019s the environmentalist who\nrecently saved a tree in Bolivia from\nbeing chopped down. How did they\ndo that? They travelled 6000 miles\nin a fuel guzzling jet; hacked away\na path in the rainforest to get to\nthe tree; then set up camp, only to\nrealize that the tent has flattened a\nrare species of ant.\nThey proceed to piss off the\nlocals who need the land to grow\nsoya beans, which make the soya\nmilk that you consume because\nit\u2019s supposedly better for the\nenvironment! But no matter, the\ntree lives to see another day. That\u2019s\nuntil the environmentalist flies\nhome one week later (after let\u2019s face\nit,a bit of a jolly),and the locals stop\nhiding the flame throwers.\nThe next species of hypocrite,\nand one whose cause seems to have\nbeen reignited recently, is the anti-capitalist. The person who preaches\nhow much better the world would\nbe if it weren\u2019t being strangled by big\nbad businesses and our consumerist\nways. Of course, they vent their\nfrustrations on capitalism via their\nApple smartphone,on a profiteering\nsocial media site, while sipping a\ncan of Coke, most probably wearing\nclothing from Topshop or Primark.\nRussell Brand is a glaring example:\nwith a net worth of \u00a315 million\nand a new book being launched\neach week, need I say much more\nabout the hypocrisy of this socialist\nchampion. What\u2019s scary is that his\nfollowers/fans/minionsactuallysoak\nup the mouth farts he\u2019s churning\nout, making a whole section of UK\nsociety his good little hypocrites (or\nrevolutionaries, should I say).\nThere\u2019s not enough time in the day\nto list every common way in which\npeople say one thing and do another.\nI think in many ways,we\u2019re all guilty\nof it. We form strong opinions on\ncrises we see on the news, yet when\nit comes to acting on those views,\nperhaps by giving money to a good\ncause, many are reluctant.\nEven something like celebrating\nChristmas every year when not\nbelieving in God could be seen as\nhypocritical. Without trying to get\ntoo deep, we\u2019re all hypocrites each\nand every day. The key is to not be\nso obvious about it.\nStop showing everyone that\npiece of bark you picked up in the\nBolivian rainforest (now a soya bean\nplantation), and the photos of you\ntickling a monkey\u2019s armpit. And\nplease, please stop following that\ncurly haired moron because you\nhave nothing better to do than rant\nabout a system that, so far, is the\nbest we\u2019ve bloody got.\nPut down the monkey..

It\u2019s been\ncalled by the National Campaign\nAgainst Fees and Cuts (NCAFC),\na democratically organised group\nof students in both Further and\nHigher Education. Their demo last\nyear got a good 10,000 people on\nthe streets.\nA group of Imperial students\nare going to this demonstration as\nan Imperial bloc \u2013 the third this\nyear mobilising our students, after\nImperial Medics joined a protest\nagainst proposed changes to junior\ndoctors\u2019 contracts.\nOrganised by our Deputy\nPresident of Welfare,Jennie Watson,\nCampaigns Officer Andrew Tranter,\nand yours truly,the bloc aims to show\nthat there are Imperial students\nwho believe in free education, and\nare willing to do something about\nit, but also to spread the word that\nthere are students who are political,\nare organised, and who make things\nhappen.\nIf you want to come along, or\njust find out what it\u2019s all about,\nsearch \u2018Imperial goes to the Free Ed\nNational Demo\u2019 on Facebook.\nTo get a flavour of what the\ndemo\u2019s objectives are, I sat down\nwith Monty Shield,a member of the\nNational Committee of NCAFC.\nFELIX: Could you give a brief\noverview of the demo, and what it\nstands for?\nM: We\u2019re fighting against the\ngovernment\u2019s education cuts and\nfighting for a better, fully funded,\nfree and democratic education\nsystem.The government is attacking\nFELIX interviews the National Campaign Against Fees and Cuts about their protest\nKieran Ryan\nWriter\nworking class students.They\u2019ve gone\non from the raising of tuition fees in\n2010 to \u00a39,000 to targeting loads of\naspects, in Further Education and\nin Higher Education as well. As\nan example: they have completely\nremoved maintenance grants in\nHigher Education for students\nstarting next year. And a National\nUnion of Students (NUS) survey\nin July revealed that over a third\nof students would have chosen\nnot to go to university without the\nmaintenance grant system.\nAnd in Further Education the\n24% cut in February was followed\nby a recent 2.5% cut once the\nConservatives won the election.\nThis has directly led to the\ndisadvantaging of working class\nand international students and\nmigrants because it led to massive\ncuts for the English for Speakers\nof Other Languages course in FE\ninstitutions, which thousands relied\non and will now have around 16,000\nplaces cut nationally. There are also\nplans to freeze the loan repayment\nearning threshold at \u00a321,000, which\nwill force poorer earners to pay\nmore.\nFELIX: That\u2019s because of\ninflation?\nM: Yeah, so inflation and the\naverage wage rise over time, but the\nthreshold for repayment stays the\nsame. So over time that \u00a321,000\nis worth less and poorer people\nwill have to pay more in relative\nterms. So as I say, they are attacking\nworking class students in all sorts of\nways.\nAnd as if they couldn\u2019t stop at\nthat, there is also the PREVENT\nprogramme for tackling \u2018extremism\u2019,\nwhich tries to force lecturers and\nuniversity councillors, amongst\nothers, to report students who don\u2019t\nfit in with \u2018British values\u2019. Which\nis ridiculous because it means\nthat you could say in a seminar\nor something that you think we\nshouldn\u2019t have the Queen as head of\nstate, as her involvement in policy\nand government is undemocratic,\nand according to the law you\ncould legitimately be reported and\nmonitored by the government for\nsaying that. So it\u2019s absurd and an\nattack on our freedom of speech. It\u2019s\nalso the case that the government\nare using this policy as a way of\nlegally targeting, monitoring and\ndiscriminating against Muslim\nstudents across the country. We\nreally need to fight it.\nBut then it\u2019s not just a negative\ndemonstration, it\u2019s not just against\nthe current system; it proposes a\nvision for a better education system.\nFELIX: Cool, what\u2019s that vision?\nM: So when we say free, partly\nthat means getting rid of tuition\nfees and supplying universal living\ngrants for everyone, but we also\nwant a fully liberated university\nsystem \u2013 part of NCAFC\u2019s policy\nis to fight for universities to be\nrun democratically, by a mixture\nof students, workers, and academic\nstaff.

What would you say to those\nstudents?\nM: The government attacks\ninternational students and at the\nsame time threatens them with\ndeportation if they resist and protest,\nso I think there is a very real pressure\non international students to not\nfight against the attacks on them.\nThe only way to stop this and the\ngovernment changes I mentioned\nbefore is if as many people as\npossible challenge collectively. So\nwhile the pressure is there, if you\nfeel you can get involved and come\non the demonstration then please\ndo and we can all fight together\nagainst these changes.\nFELIX: Imperial is pretty\napolitical, and apathetic towards\npolitics, and our student elections\nare very apolitical. However, we\nhave one of the highest turnouts\nfor our elections in the country. Do\nyou have any remarks about apathy\namong students today?\nM: Well, I did about 20 minutes\nof leafleting for the Demo last week,\nand the responses from Imperial\nstudents were all like \u201cOh yeah I\ndo believe in free education\u201d, and\nthe only thing was that they didn\u2019t\nyet know the demo was happening.\nSo, about apathy: not fighting\nsomething like this is not the same\nas staying neutral towards it. When\nyou do nothing you let the dominant\nforces call the shots, and in this case\nthat\u2019s the government - apathy lets\nthe government in power do what\nit wants to do unopposed. So really\nthe choice is: let the government\ncontinue to attack working class\nstudents, let it continue to attack\ninternational students and migrants.\nOr oppose those attacks together.\nBecause as sad as it is, if we don\u2019t\noppose it together, it will happen.\nBut what is exciting is that our\nopposition can make a massive\ndifference.\nThe protest takes place on Wednesday\nthe 3rd\nof November.\n\n"

Any variety found came in the\nform of expensive import beers like\nGuinness.\nBy 2015 it might appear that\nnothing has changed: Bud Light\nis still the USA\u2019s most drunk beer,\nbeating its equally bland rival Miller\nLight by over $3 billion in sales. Yet\nthe experience of going out for a\nbeer has unquestionably changed.\nDrinkers are now met with a\nsmorgasbord of choice thanks to the\nrise of craft beer. These are highly\nflavourful beers made by small,\nindependent companies. From\ndedicated brewpubs like The Craft\nBeer Co. to curmudgeonly chains\nlike Wetherspoons, almost every\npub sells some amount of craft beer.\nThis visible change in pubs and\nbars on both sides of the pond is\nreflected in the numbers: in the US,\ncraft beer volumes were around 5\nmillion barrels through the early\nnoughties before rapidly growing\nto 22 million today. This double\ndigit growth in production goes\nagainst the negligible change in beer\nconsumption over that time: craft\nbreweries are stealing market share\nfrom the big players.\n2018, and has sold off investments\nin other assets not essential to\nbrewing. These easy profit-boosting\nmoves have undercut the potential\nimpact AB InBev may have had.\nAreas where they might have\nhoped to cut costs, in the arguably\nbloated South African operations\nof SABMiller, will meet strong\ngovernmental opposition as local\npoliticians seek to safeguard jobs.\nIf AB InBev will struggle to\nmake radical improvements via\ncost-cutting then perhaps synergies\nwill justify the acquisition. In the\njargon of mergers and acquisitions,\nsynergies refer to the sharing\nof resources by two firms, thus\nreducing overheads and increasing\nprofits. A challenge to this is that\nthe two firms operate in different\nregions; it is difficult to realise\nefficiency gains when breweries are\non different continents.\nWhere the two firms do share\nterritory such gains might not be\nallowed: national antitrust agencies\n(bodies that watch out for the\ngrowth of monopolies) will demand\nthe selling off of assets to prevent\nthe dominance of the new company.\nThe most obvious goal of AB\nInBev is, surely, geographical.\nSABMiller has a foothold in Africa,\nwith a near 90% market share in\nSouth Africa and a small presence\nin the important Nigerian market.\nAB InBev\u2019s CEO, Carlos Brito,\nclaims that the acquisition will\nallow his firm\u2019s brands to be sold in\nthe rapidly growing African market.\nYet this is not as simple as it\nsounds. Importing brands such\nas Budweiser would make them\nprohibitively expensive. Even\nbrewing the beers locally may be\ntricky; barley is expensive in Africa\nand local brewers have responded\nby developing alternatives based\non cassava and sorghum. It remains\nto be seen whether AB InBev\u2019s\nofferings can gain traction in the\nThe Apprentice did beer once, remember? This is not the same at all. Photo Credit: BBC / Boundless\nAlastair Heffernan\nWriter\nIt is difficult\nto realise\nefficiency\ngains when\nbreweries are\non different\ncontinents\nLast orders as craft beer steals market share\nWill a mega-merger in the brewing industry save big beer?\nThe biggest of all, AB InBev\n(producer of Bud Light and\nBrazilian favourite Skol) is\nresponding to the encroachment\nof the craft brewers by buying\nits rival, second largest brewing\nconglomerate SABMiller (maker\nof Miller, Peroni and Grolsch).\nThe acquisition, provisionally\nannounced last week, will cost AB\nInBev some $104 billion and will\nproduce a global superpower in\nbrewing, responsible for around one\nin three pints consumed worldwide.\nYet, even this industry titan might\nnot be able to save big beer.\nThat\u2019s not to say that AB InBev\ndoesn\u2019t have form in the field of\nbillion dollar acquisitions. The\ncompany was born out of a deal\nthat saw Belgian based InBev buy\nUS brewer Anheuser-Busch. InBev\ntook a firm with flat lining shares\nand ruthlessly trimmed the fat,\ncutting back on everything from\nfree baseball tickets to corporate\njets. The new company, AB InBev,\nsaw its share price increase tenfold\nfrom its acquisition in 2008 to\ntoday, justifying the premium InBev\npaid for AB. The firm would seem\nwell placed to repeat this story of\nsuccess with SABMiller.\nThe problem is that SABMiller\nis not Anheuser-Busch. SABMiller\nhas seen solid share price growth\nsince 2004, rising from \u00a35 to over\n\u00a335 a share in recent weeks. In\naddition, it has undergone its own\ncost-cutting programme, projecting\nsavings of $500 million a year by\nAs most companies don\u2019t sit around with over $100 billion in the bank (Apple being a glaring exception to\nthis rule) AB InBev are looking to finance their deal using debt.They will achieve this by selling a rumoured\n$60 billion of bonds. This cash will be used to buy out around 59% of the shareholders of SABMiller for\n\u00a344 a share (the price is in sterling as SABMiller is listed in London). The remaining 41% of the shares,\nbelonging to two of the major shareholders, are being offered a partial share swap. Instead of buying the\nremaining shares, AB InBev will offer in the region of half an AB InBev share for every SABMiller one, in\naddition to a small amount of cash. Based on the current share prices, this amounts to a significant discount\nto the shareholders getting all cash.The reason the two big shareholders would accept getting a worse offer\nis that receiving shares instead of a cash windfall will prevent them receiving a massive tax bill.\nA $104 billion dollar whip-round\nregion.\nInstead of a potentially value-destroying mega-deal, the firms\nowner\u2019s might have been better\nserved by the company improving\nits prospects at home.\nOne way it could do this is\nby dealing with the elephant in\nthe room: craft beer. Instead of\nreverting to its more monopolistic\ntendencies of the past decade,\nsuch as attempting to limit craft\nbreweries\u2019 access to the market by\nthrottling distribution lines, the\nbig brewers could diversify their\noffering. They could set up beer\nincubators in the manner of tech\nstart-ups,bankrolling small brewers,\nadvertising their products and\nhelping them to market.\nIn this way AB InBev would\nundercut its current products with\nits own brands.To those that would\nrather the big beer companies stay\nout of the craft beer market, the\nreality is that if AB InBev promotes\na California pale ale or sour beer\nin the future as it does Bud Light\ntoday, it would encourage more\npeople to drink better beer, and in\ndoing so, grow the market for better\nquality brews. A bigger market for\ncraft beer benefits all producers and\nwill ensure that even more pubs\nare supplied with the good stuff. A\nworld with declining sales of dire\nlager must be a better one.\nAs it is, AB InBev has bought a\ncompany with an almost identical\nportfolio of beers as itself. While\nAfrican growth might sustain it\nfor a while, the new company will\ncontinue to face declining sales\nunder the pressure from craft beers.\nIf other markets such as Latin\nAmerica and Africa ultimately make\nthe move to craft, then perhaps AB\nInBev will end up wishing it had\ngambled on quality not quantity.\n\n"

The fair ranges from the dull\nto the exceptional \u2013 as you would\nexpect from any art fair \u2013 but the\ncommercial machine seems to\nbleed through everything. Located\nin a giant glorified marquee in\nRegent\u2019s Park, Frieze London in its\nthirteenth year claims to offer an\nunrivalled breadth and vision into\ncontemporary art. In many respects\nit succeeds and given enough\npatience, the Frieze is quite an\nexperience. Everything is on offer\nand everyone will be impressed, but\nthe atmosphere is all wrong.\nArriving at the exclusive complex,\nthe word\u2019s \u201cDeutsche Bank: Main\nSponsor\u201d are splattered left, right\nand centre. The place is crawling\nwith security and I feel distinctly\njudged for not wearing a suit or\nsome kind of felt smock.Apart from\nthe odd cluster of art students, the\ncrowd is made up of businessmen\nand what I assume are art investors.\nI\u2019m not surprised since a standard\nticket is going for an extortionate\n\u00a335,rising to over \u00a360 if you include\nFrieze Masters. Who said the\nart world isn\u2019t accessible? Having\ncycled over from an early morning\nlecture, I\u2019m quite keen on dropping\nmy bag in the cloakroom, but with\nan impressively long queue and\ncharging \u00a35 per item, I think I\u2019ll\npass. I talk an exceptionally grumpy\nsecurity guard into letting me skip\nthe queue, but only press get that\nlucky; the commoners can wait.\nWith over 160 exhibitors from\n27 countries, I\u2019m quite taken aback\nby the scale of the Frieze. I try to\nwork my way through reasonably\nmethodically, trying not to miss\ntoo much, but it\u2019s not easy. I get\nthat they\u2019re trying to put the whole\nrange on show, but everything feels\nMax Falkenberg\nArts Editor\nThe commercial bomb is dropped on the latest and greatest in contemporary art\nCube. Their work is unsurprisingly\ndecadent and impressive, but on\nthe whole the display is rather\npredictable. Walking around, I spot\neverything from Anish Kapoor to\nFrancis Picabia \u2013 contemporary art\nyes, but nothing new. A number of\nlive works are on display and the fair\nhas commissioned a series of Frieze\nprojects, but the masses of people\nand the scale of the fair makes it\npretty hard to focus. I guess I\u2019ll plan\nbetter next year.\nOh look! It\u2019s a cardboard truck!

Photo Credit: Frieze\nIt feels so\nheartless and\nit seems to\ngo against so\nmuch of what\nart stands for\nThe real reason to come to Frieze\nis for Focus \u2013 a selection of thirty\nor so up-and-coming galleries\ncurated by the Frieze to show the\nnewest, edgiest work. Here the\nnames on the walls aren\u2019t familiar,\nbut everyone knows the next few\nstars are hanging here somewhere.\nThis is the dealer\u2019s first destination\nwhen they get to the fair and I\u2019m\npretty sure everything is already\nsold by the time I get there on day\nthree. Personal favourites include a\nseries of works by Harold Ancart\nfrom the New York based gallery\nCLEARING, but I\u2019ll leave my\npicks of the Frieze for the next page.\nAdmiring \u201cWaterfall\u201d by Chinese\nartist Li Jinghu, a staff member\nfrom exhibitor Leo Xu Projects\ncan\u2019t help but try and sell me the\nwork.It\u2019s irritating,but I still admire\nthe quality of what\u2019s on show. The\nreality is that this isn\u2019t a gallery\nbut a commercial event. It\u2019s super\ninteresting and I will definitely go\nagain (if I don\u2019t have to pay \u00a335 for\na ticket), but it\u2019s a once a year event.\nTurn over for my picks of the Frieze!\nFrieze is\nparticularly\noppressive;\nthe art dealers\ndon\u2019t help\na little cramped. Thinking of all\nthe great galleries in London, the\nswarms of people at the Frieze make\neverything a little claustrophobic.\nYou can enjoy yourself at the Tate\nand it\u2019s hard not to have a good\ntime at the Serpentine. Yes it gets\nbusy everywhere, but the Frieze is\nparticularly oppressive, and the art\ndealers don\u2019t help.\nI walk past \u201cTruck\u201d by the\nGerman artist Birgit Brenner and\noverhear the exhibitor arguing with\na husband and wife over the price of\nthe work. \u20ac85,000 the dealer insists;\nthat\u2019s the art world these days he\nquips. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m all\nfor art being valued and I don\u2019t find\n\u20ac85,000 so unreasonable, but there\nis a brutality to witnessing such\nruthless negotiation in what should\nbe an enjoyable event. It feels so\nheartless and it seems to go against\nso much of what art stands for. Of\ncourse I\u2019m an idealist in that sense,\nbut I wish it didn\u2019t have to be like\nthis \u2013 a few make their millions and\nthe rest can\u2019t get by.\nI\u2019ve put quite a negative spin on\nthe Frieze and yes the elitist air is\nrather unpleasant, but I\u2019m here for\nthe art. The bulk of the fair is made\nup of stands from a selection of well-established galleries including the\nlikes of the Gagosian and the White\nThe hilarious world of Ahir Shah\nT\nhe sharpest, most\npolitically charged\ncomedy I have ever seen\n\u2013 period. Of course what\nI\u2019ve seen is somewhat limited, but\nthat changes little; Ahir Shah is\nexceptional. There are many great\ncomedians who make you laugh,\nand some who make you cry, but\nfew can make you think and feel\nlike Shah. Distant isn\u2019t just another\nset \u2013 everything is funny, but funny\nwith a purpose.\nAs a well-educated, British born\ncomedian Shah could play on his\nIndian roots and build a clumsy\nset on cultural stereotypes, but he\ndoesn\u2019t force it. He has an amazing\nappreciation for his place in society,\nand he says so much more about his\nheritage than many others would.\nShah knows he\u2019s an idealist, but\nhe also knows the hypocrisy of his\nwestern views.This isn\u2019t just comedy,\nthis is a political lecture about\npeople like him and people like us.\nWith a lightning fast delivery and\nmaterial of mind-boggling detail,\nShah\u2019s set insists on your full focus,\nand it gets it.Jumping from smoking,\nto ISIS, to the environment, Shah\ncovers immense ground, beautifully\nweaving his words from one topic to\nthe other. You could just call him a\nMax Falkenberg\nArts Editor\nThe upcoming young comedian takes on London\u2019s top comedy venue in style\nShah giving his sermon at the Edinburgh Fringe.

Shah is\na poet with unparalleled vision, and\nhe achieves this at no cost to his side\nsplitting comedy. Many won\u2019t get\nhis jokes, and for some it\u2019ll be too\nmuch to bear,but if you can stomach\nit, Shah\u2019s work is a must see.\nUntil 24th\nOctober at the Soho\nTheatre... So go tonight!\nThis isn\u2019t just\ncomedy, this\nis a political\nlecture\nImperial students enjoy Cumberbatch\u2019s performance without leaving campus\nHamlet Panopto\u2019d into the Union\nE\nveryone\u2019shadthatmoment\nwhen you wake up and\njust cannot be bothered\nto get up, get dressed\nand make it to your 9am lecture.\nSo instead you decide to stream it\nlive from home via Panopto. When\nImperial Cinema decided to take\npart in National Theatre Live and\nstream Benedict Cumberbatch\u2019s\nHamlet from the Barbican straight\ninto the Union Concert Hall, it\nwas all these students that thought\n\u2018Score! I don\u2019t have to travel across\ncentral London to watch this, I can\njust watch it from the union!\u2019\nFirst off it\u2019s important to say\nthat Panopto wasn\u2019t responsible for\nthe live stream of the show, which\nsee every heartbreaking emotion\nexpressed. This also meant however,\nthat when something happened on\nstage and it was not in shot, the\ncinemagoers became very confused,\nwondering what the actual audience\nCumberbatch in zoomed-in glorious HD. Photo Credit: Johan Persson\nwere laughing at.\nAside from these minor\noccurrences, the show was easy to\nfollow, with superb sound and visual\nquality; the rumbling bass and\nsharp lighting effects made it feel\nlike you were actually in the room.\nThe level of detail was astounding,\nsomething you might not get sitting\nat the back of a theatre, from the\nintricate designs of the set to torn\nup photographs indicating that\ntragedy is imminent in this famous\nShakespearean play.\nCumberbatch\u2019s performance as\nHamlet filled the air with an excited\nbuzz of an aggravated and disturbed\nadolescent. What he excellently\ndisplays to the audience is the\nemotional torment of a son who\nhas lost his father, while trying to\nwrap his head around an enduring\npuzzle. What is also seen is the\nemotional development of a would-be king struggling to grow up in\nvery different world. Cumberbatch\nsucceeds in drawing the audience\nin to sympathise with Hamlet, and\nwas apparent due to the ease of\ntransmission and lack of buffering.\nNational Theatre Live provided a\nsmooth and intimate experience\nfor the audience. It\u2019s rare in theatre\nto zoom in on actor\u2019s faces and\nSee every\nheartbreaking\nemotion\nexpressed\nPeter Munton\nWriter\nto hang on every word of the show\nwith anticipation, perched at the\nedge of their seats.\nFor the rest of the NT Live season,\ncheck out www.imperialcinema.co.uk\n\n"

The only clothing\nI own is black. Black\nlike my soul \u2013 my\nheart, which screams constantly in\nI\u2019m really moody, I walk to the park\nand let black mascara be washed\ndown my face by my own salty tears,\nas I talk to a withered oak tree \u2013\n\u201cthe only thing that understands my\nsuffering.\u201d\nAnd what is an angsty emo\nwithout angsty emo music? This\nweek, to free my inner 14-year-old\nwho nobody understands, I listened\nto The Agent Intellect, the third\nalbum from the Detroit-based post-punk project Protomartyr.\nAt first, these guys ticked all\nthe boxes on the \u2018forgettable and\ngeneric\u2019checklist: weird name, faux-intellectual album title,and cover art\n\u201cwith an, um, grim aesthetic that\u2026\nuh, like totally reminds us of the\ncyclicality of history or something,\nman,\u201d their producer reminds them\nwhile sucking down the third doob\nthis hour (seriously, how does he\nafford all that weed? Broke students\nwant budgeting advice).\nThen I sat down and listened to it.\nAnd again. And again. Oh, shit, it\u2019s\ngood.\nGreg Ahee spins slow guitar\nlines, favouring single notes over\nchords. The normally-thin sound\nis overdriven and smeared out by a\ncranked-up reverb pedal. The result\nis an ominous wall of swirling sound\nthat fits in elegantly over the drum\nand bass.\nSpeaking of the rhythm section,\nthey seem to be straight Joy\nDivision. Drummer Alex Leonard\nhas the same plodding rhythm\nas Stephen Morris, but will\noccasionally lapse into something\nOi mate, there\u2019s something on your head. Photo Credit: Hardly Art\nHenry Eshbaugh\nWriter\nProtomartyr\u2019s return holds no surprises\nmore aggressive and animated. To\nbe frank, there\u2019s nothing especially\ninteresting, but he definitely gets\nthe job done.\nOn first listen,I wasn\u2019t particularly\ntaken by Scott Davidson\u2019s bass\nguitar. Lines fit into the background\nwell, but didn\u2019t do anything on\ntheir own \u2013 it seemed. My first\nimpressions don\u2019t match up with\nreality \u2013 take \u2018Pontiac 87\u2019, where\nthe nifty-sounding descending line\nserves as an excellent counterpoint\nPeppers. Very cool indeed.\nThe most distinct part of the\nalbum is probably Joe Casey\u2019s\nbaritone half-singing. Casey\nis positively overflowing with\nexistential torment and a pent-up rage \u2013 opting to sing about\ntopics like Satan as a teenager and\nspecious ideologues in the audience\nof a papal visit to Michigan in\n1987 (witnessed by the frontman\nhimself). Ominous warnings are\ninterspersed \u2013 on \u2018Dope Cloud\u2019:\n\u201cYou dedicated your life to prayer /\nThat\u2019s not gonna save you, man.\u201d\nCasey\u2019s delivery is one of the\nmost striking sonic elements of\nthe album. The singer\u2019s baritone is\nreminiscent of Ian Curtis \u2013 but the\ndelivery differs. Casey\u2019s delivery is\nhalf-spoken, an understatement\nthat seems to underscore the album\u2019s\nthesis of disaffection.\nSo,the album is technically alright,\nbut how does it feel? To answer that,\none night, when I felt particularly\nmelancholy, I got drunk, hit up a\npark, and slumped under a tree to\nlisten to it front-to-back. We vibed,\nProtomartyr and I \u2013 I felt the burn\nof Rust Belt resentment deep in my\nsoul. I wouldn\u2019t say it was a spiritual\nexperience, but it definitely took the\nAngsty Factor to a solid 9.\nMy biggest gripe with this\nalbum, though, is that they don\u2019t\ndo anything new. Sonically, Joy\nDivision\u2019s Unknown Pleasures is a\nperfectly good substitute \u2013 or any\npretty good album in the genre,\nfor that matter. Without Casey\u2019s\nlyrics, there\u2019s not a lot there that\u2019s\nchanging the game \u2013 rather than\nstand on the shoulders of giants,\nthey\u2019ve opted to hide behind them.\nHowever, they definitely have sown\nseeds of a unique identity \u2013 \u2018Uncle\nMother\u2019 is a standout track in terms\nof (as Sokal put it in his seminal\npaper) transgressing the boundaries.\nwrithing agony about the horrors\nof the human condition and the\nbleakness and depravity of our\ndismal existence.

On \u2018Dope Cloud\u2019, the\nbass felt as if Davidson was literally\npulling the rest of the band towards\nthe end of the song \u2013 very cool.\nThe niftiest groove, worthy\nof special mention, came at the\nbeginning of \u2018Uncle Mother\u2019, and\nfeatured an excited bassline with\nsplattered drumming and one hell\nof a guitar hook \u2013 it almost felt\nlike they got drunk and forgot\nthey weren\u2019t the Red Hot Chilli\nOverall, this album is a well-executed continuation of the status\nquo. I wasn\u2019t satisfied. It\u2019s not game-changing, but good background\nmusic while you and your goth\nfriends get together and scribble in\nyour diaries about how your parents\njust don\u2019t get you.\nThe Agent Intellect by Protomartyr is\nout now on Hardly Art\nCasey is\npositively\noverflowing\nwith\nexistential\ntorment\nRather than\nstand on the\nshoulders\nof giants\nthey\u2019ve\nopted to hide\nbehind them\nWhen I\u2019m\nreally moody,\nI walk to the\npark and let\nblack\nmascara\nbe washed\ndown my\nface by my\nown salty\ntears\nBeachHouse\u2019slatestisdream-popfection\nI\nt\u2019s rare to see bands produce\nsuch consistently great music,\nand the few that do offer\nsubstantial evolution of their\nsound over time. Beach House,\nLucky Stars is no different in\nthis respect; it\u2019s a continuation\nof their sound that presents the\ndream-poppers at their best.\nRecorded at the same time as\nDepression Cherry (and only released\na few months after), their latest\nalbum strips out many of the layers\nof sublime production that Beach\nHouse have become known for.\nLuckily,theirmusicstillsoundswarm\nand fuzzy - the sort of stuff you\u2019ll\nwant to snuggle up to in winter.\nThe festive jingle of bells and\ndream-like keys remain, but\nthere\u2019s now a aggressiveness\nexposed underneath.

I\u2019ve\nbelieved for a while now that the\ntrue measure of a horror movie is not\nwhether it makes you jump, but if it\ninstead makes you stare emptily into\nspace for days after seeing it, start\nbringing up matters of existential\ndespair in friendly conversation,and\nlose hour after hour of sleep because\nof fears of what\u2019s lurking in your\ncupboard. Sensory shocks like jump\nscares are all very well for transient\nadrenaline bursts, but a film that\nsays something truly horrifying\nabout the human condition delivers\na psychological shakedown that\nsticks with you forever.\nSo when I saw the first trailer\nfor Guillermo del Toro\u2019s latest film\nCrimson Peak \u2013 all unfinished-looking CGI, random audio silence\nfor suspense, and that classic cheap\nscare of a loud bang-scream sound\nquite a few too many times \u2013 I\nbecame a bit nervous. Furthermore,\nalthough his previous film, Pacific\nRim, displayed del Toro\u2019s strong\nsense of craftsmanship, it was\nnonetheless bundles of simple and\nthoroughly commercialised fun.\nThat heart-sinking trailer moment\nwas now about five months ago \u2013\nto have its release coincide with the\napproaching Halloween season, del\nToro kept this new finished film\nunder wraps for quite some time\n\u2013 and thinking back, it\u2019s a relief to\nknow how much it differed from the\nfinished product. The wobbly CGI\nis fixed and then some, and while\nthere are still somewhat irritating\njump scares here and there, Crimson\nPeak is one of those rare horror\nmovies that is not just a horror\nmovie; it is much more.\nEdithCushing(MiaWasikowska),\na young writer in late 19th\ncentury\nBuffalo, New York, is struggling\nto kick-start her career; perhaps\nbecause she lacks the talent, but\nmore likely because she is a woman.\nEnter Sir Thomas Sharpe (Tom\nHiddleston), an English aristocrat\nseeking financial help for a mining\ninvention from Edith\u2019s father Carter\n(Jim Beaver). At a party thrown by\nEdith\u2019s childhood friend Dr Alan\nMcMichael (Charlie Hunnam),\nEdith meets Sharpe\u2019s sister Lucille\n(Jessica Chastain), a serious\nwoman with a chilling stillness\nabout her. Sharpe draws Edith\u2019s\nattention, and then her affection,\nwith his mysteriously charming air\n(essentially his Tom Hiddlestonness), but also riles the suspicions\nof Carter and McMichael. Carter\ndecides to take action, and the\nresulting events lead to Edith\nbeing whisked away to the Sharpe\nfamily home Allerdale Hall, an\nancient, decaying mansion literally\nbeing swallowed by the English\ncountryside surrounding it, with\ncrimson-coloured clay seeping\nthrough the floorboards.\nIt is within this house that the true\naction of the story begins: with this\nchange of setting the plot shifts from\nan intriguing romance story to a\nnebulous gothic mystery,punctuated\nby bursts of startling, blood-soaked\nimagery, and moments of shocking\nJessica Chastain as Lucille Sharp in Guillermo del Toro\u2019s Crimson Peak Photo Credit: Universal Pictures\nTom Stephens\nWriter\nGuillermo\ndel Toro\nunderstands\nthe real root\nof drama\nand horror\nCrimson Peak is an education in terror\nAn exploration of the nature of fear from gothic master Guillermo del Toro\nviolence that allow the movie to\nremain unmistakably a horror. Del\nToro shows that he hasn\u2019t lost a jot\nof his production design skill that\nmade Pacific Rim so pleasing to the\neye. The film is simply gorgeous\nfrom beginning to end; the\nsweeping, Victorian-era backdrop\nof crumbling Gothic architecture\njuxtaposed with the clanking\nmachinery of mining equipment\nmake for the vivid atmosphere of\na twisted period drama with a hint\nof steampunk. Each shot has a\npath or position that feels perfectly\nplanned and \u2013 evidently polished\nafter the making of the trailer \u2013 the\nCGI has an impressively physical,\ntangible feel to it \u2013 the ghosts that\nhaunt the mansion have a look\nthat appears (typically of del Toro\u2019s\nwork) simultaneously hypnotising\nand horrifying.\nWhat\u2019s most impressive about the\nfilm, however, is that the characters\nand the drama itself take centre\nstage, not the ghosts. Del Toro has\nsaid of his approach to filmmaking\nthat he interprets \u201cthe good and\nbad in our lives through monsters\nand fables\u201d that help him \u201cgrasp\nwho we are\u201d. With this statement\nand the film he shows that he\nunderstands the real root of drama\nand horror: it doesn\u2019t lie in monsters\nand ghosts, but in real people.\nThe actors all rise to the situation,\nincluding a charming Charlie\nHunnam, an understatedly fiery\nMia Wasikowska, and an excellent\nTom Hiddleston. None, however,\ndeliver a better performance than\nJessica Chastain as the terrifying\nLucille \u2013 her character represents\nthe best things about psychological\nhorror, as she turns out to be in fact\nthe most terrifying monster in the\nmovie. It all builds to a nail-bitingly\ngripping climax with surprising\namounts of genuine emotional\nheft. It\u2019s not a perfect movie \u2013\nthere\u2019s the occasional cheap jump\nscare or off line of dialogue, and\nit\u2019s slow to start \u2013 but del Toro has\nmanaged to recreate the melding\nof stunning production design and\nnarrative depth that made films\nlike the fantastical Pan\u2019s Labyrinth\nso good, and has shown that when\nthe horror genre, although so often\ndone wrong, can be truly stunning\nat its best.\nThe Program\nDir: Stephen Frears.

But there\nremains from those days an image\nin my head of a bright yellow strip\nof rubber that I\u2019d pulled onto my\nwrist, with a word engraved into it\nthat filled me with a kind of warmth\nthat I\u2019d never really understood\nat the time, but I recognise now\nto be some form of pride. The\nword was \u201cLivestrong\u201d, the name\nof the cancer-based charity that\nLance Armstrong, big-time\ncycling champion, philanthropist\nand all-round incredible guy, had\nestablished. I barely knew anything\nabout the exact scale of Armstrong\u2019s\napparent achievement (which, as it\nturns out, was massive), but to me,\nhe was quite simply a hero; I had\nseen him on TV, he won stuff, and\nhe helped people, what else could\nyou possibly need to be one?

Script: Gabe\nPolsky. Starring: Slava Fetisov,\nVladislav Tretiak, Scotty Bowman,\nVladimir Pozner. 84 minutes.\nI\nn my experience, when\nwatching a documentary, it\nhelps to have at least a slight\ninterest in the subject. It\u2019s a\nlesson I learnt myself when I went\nto see Asif Kapadia\u2019s 2010 film\nSenna, despite having nothing short\nof complete antipathy towards the\nentire industry of Formula One.\nNeedless to say I did not enjoy it.\nAnd so the thought of sitting down\nto see Red Army, a film that centres\naround the sport of ice hockey \u2013 a\ntopic about which I know essentially\nnothing \u2013 did not fill me with joy.\nHow I was mistaken.\nDirector Gabe Polsky, himself a\nkeen hockey player, takes the classic\napproach of using a singular example\nas a metaphor for something greater;\nin this example, the Soviet Union\nice hockey team \u2013 who completely\ndominated the field from 1954, the\nyear after Stalin\u2019s death, up until the\ndissolution of the USSR in 1991 \u00ad\n\u2013\ntake the metaphorical weight of the\nCold War upon their broad, well-built shoulders.Told largely through\nthe eyes of Russian legend Slava\nFetisov, Red Army is a story almost\ntoo unbelievable to be true; with\nthe international reputation of the\nUSSR, and with it socialism itself,\nbased on how the players would\nperform, the stakes were nerve-rackingly high,elevating an already-dramatic sport to Dostoyevskian\nlevels.\nOf course, every story needs a\nvillain, and Red Army\u2019s is provided\nby Viktor Tikhonov, the ruthless\ncoach who \u2013 while driving the team\nto victory \u2013 ruined any chance the\nplayers had at a normal life; in one\nmemorable anecdote,a player recalls\nthat they were trained so hard that\nmembers of the team began to\nurinate blood.Through sketching in\nTikhonov as the arch-enemy, Red\nArmy gains dramatic clout, but this\nis tempered by the niggling feeling\nthat the explanation is too simplistic:\nsure, Tikhonov seemed heartless,\nand probably was, but the wider\ncontext of what factors in the USSR\nwould lead to such an appointment\nare never really explored. After all,\nnot all evil actions are performed by\nbad people, a statement reinforced\nat the end of this film, when it is\nrevealed that Fetisov, held up as a\nskating hero, was personally invited\nto become Minister for Sport by\nVladimir Putin \u2013 a leader who\nis perhaps the greatest threat to\nEuropean human rights.\nBut brevity is the soul of wit,\nand omitting a thorough historical\nanalysis allows Polsky to focus\non the heroes of the story \u2013 the\nRussian Five, the quintet who led\nthe team to victory time and time\nagain. Aided by snazzy graphics \u2013\nall Cyrillic lettering and socialist-realist cartoons of overjoyed peasant\nwomen \u2013 the film weaves together\nnearly half a century of skating\nhistory into a rich tapestry, one\nthat manages to combine high\ndrama with touches of humour.\nIndeed, the film is threaded with\nnumerous moments of levity, from\nan ex-KGB agent speaking to his\ngranddaughter to muddled Russian\nidioms that clearly have no English\nequivalent, a feature that lifts some\nof the gravitas such a complex topic\ncan bring.\nHis first documentary feature,Red\nArmy marks an incredibly strong\ndebut from Polsky. While he has\na habit of making himself very\n\u2018present\u2019 in the film \u2013 including\nthe frequently-muddled questions\nhe asks his sitters, zooming out\nto reveal parts of the recording\nequipment,panning across someone\nwho is speaking; he\u2019s certainly no\nFrederick Wiseman \u2013 these don\u2019t\ninterfere with the overall effect of\nthe film. Red Army may document\nthe position ice hockey held in\nSoviet life \u2013 a fast, brutal sport in a\nruthless regime \u2013 but, like the team\nitself, Polsky handles the material\nwith a lightness of touch, and true\nfinesse.\nFRED FYLES\ncan\u2019t win without it? \u2013 and The\nProgram deals well with both sides\nof the issue.\nIt documents the rise of\nArmstrong from not-so-humble\nbeginnings to seven-time winner\nof the Tour de France, and his\nfall from an honest, ambitious (if\nobnoxious) cyclist to a sociopathic\nmegalomaniac. Ben Foster gives a\nmagnetic performance as the man\n\u2013 his early earnestness is perhaps\nthe only reason that one could\nsympathise with the character of\nArmstrong for around the first third\nof the movie, and as he becomes\nincreasingly entangled in the web\nof his own deception, a venom seeps\ninto the performance so deep that\nyou can almost feel flecks flying off\nhis tongue onto your face.\nBut a good story and a great\nlead performance, however, does\nnot a good film make, and The\nProgram\u2019s flaws often lie in the\nlittle details. Frears does a fine job\nwith individual scenes, camera\nmovements, and conversations,\nbut never fully delivers a sense of\nthe cinematic, and the film can\nsometimes feel as if it were made for\nTV \u2013 there\u2019s no really breathtaking\nmoment or setpiece, whether in the\nsporting or the human drama. The\nscript too is thoroughly uneven:\nChris O\u2019Dowd does well as David\nWalsh, the sports journalist on a\nmission to expose Armstrong, when\nhe\u2019s involved in actual dialogue,\nbut many of his lines and those\nof the people he speaks to are\nriddled with awkward exposition.\nThe only other cast member who\ncomes across well is Jesse Plemons\nas Floyd Landis, the cyclist who\ngot caught doping and decided to\nbring Armstrong down with him;\npretty much all other characters are\nbadly written, badly acted or both.\nThis is especially true in the case\nof Guillaume Canet\u2019s performance\nas Armstrong\u2019s manager Michele\nFerari \u2013 several times I found myself\nthinking, \u201cDid he really direct him\nto say it like that?\u201d\nWhile there is also a problem\nBen Foster as Lance Armstrong in Stephen Frears\u2019 The Program Photo Credit: StudioCanal\nBen Foster\ngives a\nmagnetic\nperformance\nas Armstrong\nwith some of the editing choices\n\u2013 headlines documenting his\nwins and names of random new\ncharacters flash onto the screen in\nsuch silly pop-art style that it looks\nlike it was pieced together on an\nold laptop \u2013 other pieces of editing\nwork well, such as cuts between\nArmstrong\u2019s motivational speeches\nand scenes of the team injecting\nsyringe after syringe of dope. Scenes\nlike these remind you of just how\nridiculous the scam became \u2013 and\nof why this movie is an important\none: it reminds us to question our\nidols,and to not believe great stories\nsimply because they\u2019re great. It\u2019s just\na shame the execution of it makes it\nsometimes feel a bit damp.\nTOM STEPHENS\n\n"
