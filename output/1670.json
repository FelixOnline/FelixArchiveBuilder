    "content": "ISSUE 1670\nFELIX\n15\nARTS arts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nRoyal Academy shows the links between two titans\nTheir latest exhibition explores the links between Salvador Dal\u00ed and Marcel Duchamp, two of the most influential\nartists of the 20th\ncentury\nARTS\nSimran Kukran\nArts Writer\nS\nalvador Dali and\nMarcel Duchamp\nare both regarded\nas two of the\ntwentieth century\u2019s most\ninfluential artists, but\nare often seen as polar\nopposites. Although their\npersonal and professional\nlives have been studied\nextensively in literature,\nthis exhibition at the Royal\nAcademy is the first to\ndisplay their works side\nby side, exploring their\nfriendship. Duchamp\u2019s\nwork is highly conceptual;\ntoday he is perhaps most\ncommonly remembered\nfor Fountain, a displaced\nurinal he submitted to an\nopen exhibition under a\npseudonym, only to defend\nit in a magazine under his\nown well-regarded name\nonce it had been rejected.\nDuchamp rejected the\nidea that art was meant to\nbe aesthetically pleasing.\nAlthough he personally\ndistanced himself from\nany movements, he was\nhighly associated with the\nDadaism; an avant-garde,\nintellectual movement\nwherein artists produced\nart rejecting bourgeois\nvalues in the wake of the\nFirst World War.\nDali, on the other\nhand, is best known for\nhis highly technical,\nrenaissance-influenced\nsurrealist paintings, exploring the dream world\npost-Freud, moving away\nfrom rational thought. His\npersona was based on a\n\u2018love of everything that is\ngilded and excessive\u2019, and\nhe was highly criticised for\nreturning to Spain during\nFranco\u2019s reign, living out\nhis final years with his\nwife in a castle.\nDespite these differences in philosophy and\noutlook, the playful artists\nwere united in their wit\nand cynical view on life\nand art. The exhibition\npresents common themes\nin the Artists\u2019 work across\nthree rooms. The first,\nIdentity is both chronological and thematic.\nA highlight is Dali\u2019s A\nPortrait of my Father\n(1925), painted just after\nDali had been kicked out\nof the Academy in Madrid\nfor telling his examiners\nthey were unfit to judge\nhim. This is alongside\nDuchamp\u2019s Portrait of\nthe Artist\u2019s Father (1910),\n\u201cThe exhibition\nis the first\nto display\ntheir works\nside by side,\nexploring their\nfriendship\u201d\nlooking thoughtful and\nfatigued. It is clear that\nalthough Duchamp was\n17 years older than Dali,\ntheir interests and satirical\nrebellion followed similar\ntrajectories, pushing the\nboundaries of cubism and\nfuturism. Their shared\nsense of humour can be\nseen in their moustachioed\ntakes on the Mona Lisa.\nDuchamp\u2019s is titled with\na pun \u2013 L.H.O.O.Q (1919)\nsounding out the French\nsentence \u201cShe has a hot\narse.\u201d while Dali\u2019s Self\nPortrait as the Mona Lisa\n(1964) parodies his own\nself-centredness.\nThe second room,\nThe Body and the Object\nexplores how both men\nchallenged conventional\nmedia of art. Duchamp\u2019s\nready-mades including\nthe fountain and bicycle\nwheel sit on a backdrop\nof Dali\u2019s antipaintings; a\nseries of abstract shapes\non canvas which were an\nexpression of his frustration over whether an\noriginal form of painting\ncould ever be found. For\nFisherman in the Sun, Dali\nrefused to be restricted by\nthe confines of the canvas\nand used rope to extend\nit. Both artists abandoned\npainting. Duchamp permanently in 1913, and\nDali temporarily in 1928.\nAlthough this is before\nthe artists\u2019 friendship,\nit is possible that Dali\nhad been influenced by\nDuchamp criticism of art\nbeing appreciated only on\na \u2018retinal\u2019 level.\nPerhaps another topic\nof conversation in their\n30-year friendship was\nfascination with science\nand questioning reality.\nDali\u2019s Apparition of\nFace and Fruit Dish on\na Beach (1938) is full of\nvisual puns. Once a few\nare recognised, the reader\nis tricked into looking for\nmore, finding shapes in\nthe clouds perhaps where\nthey were not originally\nintended. These optical\nillusions were an exploration of his interest in\npsychoanalysis and reality\nitself. Duchamp\u2019s \u2018three\nstandard stoppages\u2019 is my\nfavourite work in the exhibition \u2013 three meter-long\nropes were dropped from\na height and their new\nlength end-to-end encased\nin glass and declared a\n\u2018standard\u2019 unit of meas-urement, almost laughing\nat the arbitrary bases of\nphysics.\nAnother common\ntheme of the artists\u2019 work\nis eroticism and voyeur-ism. Although Dali and\nDuchamp are not the only\nmen in the world to have\nappreciated nudes, their\nartworks and lewd puns\nextend beyond the chat of\ndirty old men. Duchamp\u2019s\nfinal work, which he\nworked on in secret over\nthe last two decades of\nhis life, \u00c9tant donn\u00e9s\n(1946-1966) is too fragile\nto travel but is represented\nwith a photograph. The\nwork is perhaps one of\nthe first art installations,\nand sits at the Philadelphia\nMuseum of Modern Art\nbehind a wooden door that\nmust be peeked through.\nInside lies a diorama of a\nnaked woman lying with\nher legs splayed apart on\na bed of twigs and fallen\nleaves. This sits alongside\nDali\u2019s near pornographic\npaintings, including The\nFirst Days of Spring. Both\nartists play with a reductive perspective of desire.\nThe focus of the final\nsection, Experimenting\nwith Reality and perhaps\nthe whole exhibition is a\nreplica of Duchamp\u2019s large\nglass, The Bride Stripped\nBare by her Bachelors,\nEven. The objects suspended in the panels\n\u2013 including cones that\nwere left to gather dust to\ndepict \u2018slow\u2019 art \u2013 are particularly impressive. This\npiece took over 10 years\nto complete. A parallel is\ndrawn between the glass\nand Dali\u2019s Christ of Saint\nJohn of the Cross (1951).\nBoth are the size of altar\npieces and have a definite\ntop and bottom half, but\nthis comparison seems the\ncrudest and weakest of the\nwhole exhibition, perhaps\nan excuse to present one of\nDuchamp\u2019s most interesting pieces, for which the\ninterpretations are endless.\nOne of the final works\nin the exhibition is a\nphotograph of Dali and\nDuchamp sat playing\nchess, a shared hobby and\nfascination which served\nas inspiration for both. The\nexhibition adds a personal\ndimension to the understanding of both artists,\ninvestigating a friendship\nthat spanned decades and\ncontinents, allowing us\nto better understand the\nemotions of two revolutionary painters.\nSalvador Dal\u00ed, The First Days of Spring, 1929 // Salvador Dal\u00ed Fundac\u00edon, DACS 2017\nWhere?

Whether it\nis families visiting the\ngallery with children\nwho have never heard of\nBasquiat, or the Young\nBarbican members who\nhave been waiting most\nof their lives to see his\nwork in real life \u2013 it has\nstruck me how inviting\nand accessible his work\nis to everyone who comes\nto see it. Laden with\nsymbols, text and imagery,\nBasquiat\u2019s work draws\nout people\u2019s curiosity and\ninvites the audience to\nmake their own interpre-tations.\nFHL: How do you\nthink Basquiat has influenced art today?\nCW: Basquiat\u2019s work\ncontinues to inspire new\nartists across all the art\nforms; young people are\ninspired by the fact that he\nhad no formal training and\nbroke the boundaries of\nthe art world \u2013 I think his\ncross-arts approach and\nthe collaborative nature of\nthe New York scene also\nresonates with the next\ngeneration of artists who\nare increasingly under\npressure to do more and\nbe multi-disciplinary.\nFHL: Why did you decide to curate this\nevent and why now?\nCW: We heard a lot of\nexcitement from the\nyoung people we work\nwith at Barbican Guildhall\nCreative Learning when\nBoom for Real was first\nannounced - the work of\nJean-Michel Basquiat\nreally resonates with\nyoung people. It felt fitting\nto curate an event that\ngives young people the\nopportunity to explore and\nshowcase their creativity.\nPoets, curators, reviewers,\nartists and photographers:\nBasquiat\u2019s cross-arts\npractice provides a perfect\nplatform to bring these\nart forms together at\nBarbican.\nFHL: How and why\ndid you choose the\nestablished artists in-volved?\nCW: The artists involved\nare a mix of artists we\nhave existing relationships\nwith, like poet Jacob\nSam-La Rose who leads\nBarbican Young Poet and\nPaula Varjack, a performer\nwho is a tutor on Barbican\nJunior Poets, and artists we\nhave cultivated projects\nwith specifically for this\nshow, like glitch artist\nAntonio Roberts who we\nare undertaking a new\nglitch portrait project with.\nWe have also engaged\nfour past-members of\nBarbican Young Poets to\nhost conversations on the\n\u2018SAMO\u00a9, but different\u2019\nstage, and have a group of\nsixteen young artists from\nacross all our programmes\nwho will be creating new\nwork in a two-day \u2018Art\nHack\u2019 and showcasing\nit on our main stage. To\nengage new artists we\nhave partnered with Poet\nin the City to co-curate\nseveral parts of the event\n\u2013 through our work with\nthem we\u2019ve been able to\nfind an exciting group of\nwriters, poets, musicians\nand street artists, all of\nwhom feel a personal\nconnection to Basquiat\u2019s\nwork.\nFHL: What first drew\nyou to these artists?\nCW: We approached them\nmainly because their\npractice had a link or connection to Basquiat. For\nsome artists this was a very\nliteral connection \u2013 for\nexample Gemma Weekes\nwill be sharing an excerpt\nof her performance Who\nMurked Basquiat?, a piece\ninspired by the work, life\nand times of Basquiat and\nher own struggles with\nmisogynoir. For others it\nwas more about finding\nparallels in practice. I\napproached glitch artist\nAntonio Roberts because\nof his interest in copyright,\nownership and appropriation of content \u2013 Antonio\nis both an artist and the\ncurator of the show \u2018No\nCopyright Infringement\nIntended\u2019 and the themes\nthat run through his\npractice resonate with\nBasquiat\u2019s process.\nFHL: Is the future of\nart in collaboration?\nCW: Collaboration is\nalways going to be important to art, but it is especially essential for young\ncreatives today who are\nunder pressure to be artist,\ncurator, agent, marketer\nand often commissioner of\ntheir own work. It is important that young people\nare supported and feel\nthey are a part of a creative\ncommunity that both\nsupports them and pushes\ntheir boundaries. With Too\nYoung For What?, we are\ntrying to draw inspiration\nfrom the collaborative\nscene that Basquiat was\na part of, while drawing\nparallels to the London\nscene today. Many of the\nworkshops and activities\nare collaborative in nature\nand the \u2018Make A Scene\u2019\nroom invites visitors to\nhave a say, discuss and\ncreate content that reflects\ntheir creativity today.\nWhy is it important\nto have platforms for\nyoung artists?\nCW: With increasing\npressure and standardisation in formal education,\nit\u2019s important that young\npeople have opportunities\nto explore their own\ncreativity and measure\ntheir progress against\ntheir own goals and stand-ards. Barbican\u2019s Young\nCreative programmes\ngive young people an\nopportunity discover their\ncreative voice and work\nwith mentors who support\nthem to showcase their\nbest work. There are many\nroutes into careers in the\narts and it\u2019s important to\nprovide young people with\ninformal opportunities that\nfit around the pressures\nin their lives \u2013 our programmes like the Young\nVisual Arts Group give\nyoung people insight into\nwhat a career as an artist/\ncurator looks like, but also\ninto the inner workings of\narts organisations, so they\ngain an understanding\nof how to programme,\nmarket, deliver and\nevaluate their own arts\nevent.\nToo Young for What will\ntake place at the Barbican\nCentre on Saturday the 7th\nof October from 12 noon.\nAdmission is free. Check\nbarbican.org.uk for full-programme of events\nToo Young For What? is a free day of art and activities at the Barbican Centre inspired by Basquiat: Boom For\nReal, a retrospective on the work of American artist Jean-Michel Basquiat. The day will feature work by glitch\nartist Antonio Roberts, poet Jacob Sam-La Rose and performance maker Paula Varjack as well as workshops and\ndiscussions.

This is in line with\nBlackett\u2019s manifesto\npromise of \u201cno above-in-flation drink prices\u201d. The\nalso mentioned in The\nGuardian three days pre-viously). An anonymous\nsenior source told the i:\n\u201cWe don\u2019t think it is right\nthat the poorest students\ncome out of university\nwith most debt.\u201d\nMaintenance grants\nwere scrapped in 2015\nin favour of loans, which\nwere more generous but\nalso had to be paid back\nwith interest. Then-chancellor George Osborne\nmade the changes on the\nbasis that maintenance\ngrants cost the taxpayer\n\u00a31.57 billion a year. He\nclaimed that lifting the cap\non student places would\ndouble this figure to \u00a33\nbillion and there would\nbe a \u201cbasic unfairness in\nasking taxpayers to fund\ngrants for people who are\nlikely to earn a lot more\nthan them\u201d.\nThe IFS estimates that\nswitching from loans to\ngrants would cost just\nunder \u00a3500 million.\nThe changes to tuition\nfees would also require\nan additional \u00a32 billion\ngovernment funding. The\ngovernment has declined\nto say where this extra\nmoney will come from.\nAny details will emerge\nin Philip Hammond\u2019s\nautumn budget statement\nnext month. Let\u2019s hope the\nmagic money tree is still\nalive and well.\nNEWS\n(cont. from page 1)\nUnion claims the price\nfreeze will save students\nmore than \u00a310,000, since\nremaining with Stella\nwould have required an\nincrease in price by 10p.\nIn a statement, Blackett\nsaid \u201cthe opportunity\narose for us to reduce the\ncost of our house larger\nwhilst also increasing the\ninvestment in other areas\nof the bars to improve\nstudent experience, whilst\nnot losing any quality in\nthe products we offer\u201d.\nHe said that this increased\ninvestment should \u201cgive\nyou a better service and an\nimproved experience at all\nof our venues\u201d\nWhile Stella 4 has,\nas the name suggests, a\nstrength of 4% ABV, Bud\nLight only has a strength\nof 3.5%. On BeerAdvocate, which describes itself\nas \u201cyour go-to resource\nfor beer, powered by an\nindependent community\nof enthusiasts and professionals\u201d, Stella 4 achieves\na rating of 2.97 out of 5,\nwhile Bud Light is on\n1.86.\nOne of the bar staff\nFelix spoke to said that\nthey had overheard a customer react to the change\nby saying it was \u201ca cold\nday in hell\u201d. Students who\nspoke to Felix expressed\nsimilar sentiments: one\ndescribed Bud Light as\n\u201cliteral piss\u201d; another\nsaid that the \u201chypocrisy\u201d\nof the Union\u2019s failure to\nconsult students on the\nchange, while criticising\nthe College for making\nchanges to Campus Services without consultation,\nwas \u201cchilling\u201d.\nIt wasn\u2019t all bad news\nthough: one student\nclaimed that Bud Light\nmade a much better mixer\nfor his snakebite.\nBlackett told Felix:\n\u201cWe constantly change the\noffering in our bars with\nno student consultation, as\nit is not always appropriate\nand timely for feedback\nfrom students to be garnered.\u201d He explained that\nthe decision on the change\nneeded to be made within\ntwo days of the offer being\nrecieved, and his being\nelected on a manifesto\npromises to you\u201d section,\nImperial College Union,\nwhich is a not-for-profit\ncharity, states that \u201cthe\nrange of products we offer\nwill be regularly reviewed\nto ensure we are providing\nyou with the products you\nwant\u201d.

If this keeps\nup, we\u2019ll have computers machine writing the\nwhole issue, and I\u2019ll\nbe jetting off to travel\naround Italy before\nXmas. But for now it\u2019s\nprogress enough.\nThis week sees\nFelix kicking back into\naction. We\u2019re back, with\neveryone\u2019s favourites:\npuzzles! Endless pages\nof Arts! Union hackery!\nIt\u2019s like we never really\nleft.\nWhen chatting with\nthe News team about\nwhat should go on the\nfront page this week, we\nwere trying to decide\nbetween two stories: on\nthe one hand, a shadowy\npowerful body has\nmade what seems to be\na decision against the\nwishes of their elector-ate; on the other hand,\nTheresa May announced\nthey were going to cap\ntuition fees.\nIn the end the tuition\nfees debate won out,\nbut while I suspect it\nwill have more of an\nimpact on the financial\nfutures of so many of\nus, at the end of the day\nall that most of us really\ncare about is being fed,\nclothed, watered, and as\nhappy as can be possible\nwhilst working in the\nPhysics department.\nFor that reason, I think\nthe story that will have\nmore of an impact this\nweek is the fact that\nthe Union have poured\ntheir last Stella, and are\nswapping their house\nlager to Bud Light.\nWhile I\u2019m more\npartial to stout myself,\nI can see why people\nare upset \u2013 not so much\nabout the change, but\nabout the fact that\nthey weren\u2019t consulted\nabout it beforehand.\nMatt Blackett, Deputy\nPresident (Finances and\nServices), explained\nsome of his reasoning\nto Felix, and only time\nwill tell how things will\ngo. But this is what we\nshould be doing at Felix:\nfostering debate and\ndialogue; encouraging\nstudents to share their\nviews; and ensuring that\nthose in power \u2013 both the\nUnion and the College \u2013\nare held to account.\nDialogue was something I was thinking\na bit about after the\nFreshers\u2019Fair this week.\nWhile Felix was outflanked and out-teched\nby ICTV, we still had a\nlot of interested students\ncoming up to us. Some\nwanted to write. Others\njust wanted to know\nwhat we were. Others\nstill thought we were a\ncat appreciation society\n\u2013 an easy mistake to\nmake.\nEven if you missed\nus this week, I want to\nuse this editorial to try\nand convince you to get\ninvolved. Not only do\nyou get to work with a\ngreat bunch of people,\nbut you also get free\ntea and coffee in the\nFelix Office. With that\nin mind, we\u2019re holding\na pizza party in the West\nBasement next Monday\nat 6pm \u2013 come along,\nenjoy some drinks and\nfood, and meet the\npeople who stay up\nstupid hours to get the\npaper out on time.\nSome of you might\nend up writing for us.\nMany more will just\nread Felix, just like\nyou\u2019re doing now.

    "content": "ISSUE 1670\nFELIX\n21\nBOOKS books.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nThe story of one life, and another, and another, and\nanother\nI\nn 4321, Paul Auster\nsets out his main\nhypothesis on the\nsecond page. He\u2019s\ntelling the tale of Isaac\nReznikoff, a European\nJewish immigrant who\nmoves to America at the\nturn of the century, and\nis bestowed the name\nIchabod Ferguson by an\nimmigration official at\nEllis Island. A kind of\nimmigrant-everyman, his\nlife is tough, and money\nis tight, and so the only\nthings he can give his\nfamily are stories about\n\u201cthe vagabond adventures\nof his youth.\u201d \u201cIn the long\nrun,\u201d Auster writes, \u201cstories are probably no less\nvaluable than money, but\nin the short run they have\ntheir decided limitations\u201d.\nIf this is the case,\nand written words are\nas valuable as dollars\nand cents, then 4321 is a\nbullion. A tombstone of a\nnovel, it stands at nearly\n900 pages long, completely impractical for reading\non the move. Throughout\nthe course of the novel,\nAuster takes us through\nthe early life of Archibald\nFerguson, the grandson of\nIchabod, who grows up in\nthe New Jersey-New York\narea in the 1950s and 60s.\nOr rather, he takes us\nthrough the early lives of\nFerguson, since from the\noff the timeline is disrupt-ed, with four Fergusons\ndiverging off from each\nother in parallel, their\nexperiences all slightly\ndifferent. Early trials\nand tribulations play a\nlarger role in how the\nFergusons develop than\nlater developments, and\nsymmetries and patterns\ndevelop between the four\ntimelines. The Schneiderman family, for instance,\nplay a key role in each\nnarrative, but each time\ndifferent members come\nto prominence; Amy Sch4321 subverts the tired\ntrope of the \u2018immigrant\nnovel\u2019, turning around\nthe idea that any individual story of hardship can\nencapsulate 20th\nCentury\nAmerican life. If one were\nto separate out the four\ntimelines of 4321, and\npresent each as a short\nnovel, then each could\nprobably be described\nas \u2018a microcosm of the\nmid-century USA\u2019 \u2013 by\npresenting them together\nAuster reveals how hollow\nsuch platitudes ring.\nWhen Auster was 14,\nhe himself had an early\nbrush with death, coming\nnarrowly close to a lightning strike that killed the\nboy next to him. This has\nclear influences on 4321,\nwith the title becoming a\ncountdown of Fergusons\nremaining as the others\nshuffle off their mortal\ncoil. The first of these\ncomes less than half way\nthrough the book \u2013 a\ndramatic shock that is\nintensified by the blank\nchapters that take up the\nrest of that character\u2019s\nnarrative, which function\nas a bleak epitaph.\nAuster draws on his\nown experiences at\nother points too: three of\nhis Fergusons become\nwriters \u2013 in a variety of\ndisciplines \u2013 and two\nwrite books that are direct\ncopies of the lines Auster\nhad written earlier on in\nthe novel. These kind of\nmetafictional twists are\nwhat Auster does best, and\n4321 is no different.\nAs an exercise in meta-fiction, Auster\u2019s intention\nis clear, but 4321 still\nmanages to hold up as\na straightforward piece\nof fiction \u2013 an excellent\nthing, since it makes up\nfor the wrist strain experienced from carrying\naround the tome. With\nlengthy, verbose sentences\nthat run into each other in\na delirious train of descrip-tion, Auster contemplates\na number of big themes,\ncentring around the Jewish\nmid-20th\nCentury experi-ence, and the special place\nNew York \u2013 \u201cthe capital of\nhuman faces, a horizontal\nBabel of human tongues\u201d\n\u2013 has in that milieu.\nPhilip Roth\u2019s 1997\nmasterpiece American\nPastoral takes on similar\nthemes, but while Roth\u2019s\nnarrative is darker, and\ngoes further forward into\nthe paranoiac decade of\nthe 1970s, 4321 remains\nrelatively buoyant. The\naction plays out against a\nbackdrop of the turmoil of\nthe 1960s, with the killing\nof Martin Luther King, the\n1967 Newark riots, and\nthe 1968 Columbia University protests cropping\nup \u2013 the casual anti-sem-itism of WASP America\nmakes an impact, causing\none Ferguson to reflect\nthat \u201cuntil that moment\nit had never occurred to\nhim that he might not be\nan American, or, more\nprecisely, that his way of\nbeing an American was\nany less authentic\u201d \u2013 but\nthe Fergusons move\nthrough relatively un-scathed, and their world\nviews remain remarkably\nsimilar, despite their different life experiences.\nAuster\u2019s sentences are\na delight to read, but can\nhave a tendency to veer\ninto self-parody. Consider\nthis one:\n\u201cAs Ferguson listened\nto Amy defend New York,\ndeclare her love of New\nYork, it occurred to him\nthat she herself was\nsomehow an embodiment\nof her city, not only in her\nconfidence and quickness\nof her mind but also and\nespecially in her voice,\nwhich was the voice of\nbrainy Jewish girls from\nBrooklyn, Queens, and\nthe Upper West Side, the\nthird-generation New York\nJewish voice...\u201d\nThe sentence then continues for the remainder\nof the page, and while it\nis beautiful, it is one of a\nnumber of moments where\nyou feelAuster might have\nrequired a firmer editing\nhand. Similar issues crop\nup towards the end of the\nnovel, where things come\ntogether a bit too neatly \u2013\nthe threads of destiny are\ntied together by Auster\nin a way that, to me,\ncame across as trite. That\nbeing said, 4321 remains\na powerful experience \u2013\nAuster has managed to\nsustain a simple conceit\nthrough an epic length,\nthanks to his powerhouse\ncontrol of the written\nword. In the long run,\nthat is definitely worth its\nweight in gold.\nWith the Man Booker\nPrize being announced\nTuesday week, Felix Books\nwill be reviewing more\nfrom the shortlist over the\nnext couple of weeks.\nPaul Auster\u2019s Booker-nominated 4321 is an audacious work of metafiction, which revels in its multiple timelines\nDilemma: carrying 4321 around will make you look clever, but will fuck up your back // Wikimedia/Faber & Faber\nBOOKS\nFred Fyles\nEditor-in-Chief\nFaber & Faber. 880 pp.\n4321\nby Paul Auster\n\u201cWhen Auster\nis at his most\nmetafictional,\n4321 begins to\nshine\u201d\nneiderman, the daughter\nof the family, plays a key\nrole, here romantic, here\nfamilial. Similarly the\npath that each Ferguson\ntakes is different, from\ncollege choices to family\ntragedies.\nWhen Auster is at his\nmost metafictional, the\nnovel begins to shine.\n\n"

Upon arrival,\nit was discovered that\nthey were to be sharing\nan apartment complex\nwith athletes of a similar\ncalibre to their own \u2013 the\nKorean triathlon team.\nThe stunning views and\nimpressive peaks visible\nfrom the balconies whet\ntheir appetite for a week\nof gruelling hills, tricky\ntrails, and challenging\nclimbs.\nThe week of training\nsaw a number of events:\nsteady group runs to take\nin the local sights, such\nas Europe\u2019s largest solar\nfurnace; a questionable\n\u201crest\u201d day featuring a re-covery-turned-tempo run;\na super early run to watch\nthe sunrise from a vantage\npoint by the ruins of a\ncastle; a competitive continuous relay session at the\nathletics track; attempts at\nranking highly on some\nof the nearby Strava\ndidn\u2019t consist solely of\nrunning!\nDuring the week, the\nfour rooms took turns to\nhost a Come Dine with\nMe-style evening of food,\ndrink, and entertainment.\nThe themes included\nwedding, Ancient Greek,\nBritish pub, and traditional French, with food highlights including an assortment of canap\u00e9s, stuffed\npeppers, three-in-one\npasta, homemade curry,\ntartiflette, sticky toffee\npudding, apple crumble,\nand Greek doughnuts.\nThe evening entertainments featured various\ngames that revealed lots\nabout the club members,\nparticularly the pub quiz\nwhich featured a round\ninvolving embarrassing\npast Facebook statuses\nfrom tour members and a\nsize comparison between\nBig Ben, a Mini Cooper,\na King-sized bed, the Taj\nMahal, and the penis of a\nblue whale.\nBesides all this, the\nCX about to drop the hottest running mixtape of 2k17 // IC Cross Country and Athletics\nweek saw countless games\nof Perudu, questionable\nuses for bags of flour, and\nlarge portions of banter\n\u2013 sometimes reaching\ndangerously high levels!\nOn the last night, to celebrate the end of the highly\nsuccessful week, the team\nheaded for a late-night\nrave by one of the larger\nstatues in the outdoor\nstatue walk.\nThe club would like\nto thank outgoing club\ncaptain Will Jones for\nfantastic work in organising the trip and wish all\nmembers of the club grad-uating/leaving all the best\nfor the future.

There\u2019s also\nan orienteering twist to the\nraces, as teams compete\nto reach pre-positioned\ncheckpoints and gain\npoints. The tougher the\ncheckpoint is to reach, the\nmore points are assigned\nto it. At the end, the team\nwith the highest number\nof points is crowned the\nchampion.\nWe split-up into individual teams of three\nor four to take on our\nfellow tri members and\n50 other equally fit &\nmotivated teams. Olympic\nrower, Helen Glover,\neven decided to make an\nappearance! This race\ncertainly wasn\u2019t going to\nbe a walk in the park.\nBeing a team race, one\nconstraint was that team\nmembers could not be\nmore than 10m apart \u2013\nmeaning the entirety of\nthe threesome/foursome\nhad to complete grueling\nuphill climbs or long\nkayaking distances to be\nallowed the checkpoint\npoints.\nWhen the klaxon\nsounded at 9am, it was\neach team for themselves.\nEveryone headed off in\ndifferent directions, each\nbelieving theirs would lead\nthem to glory.

Among the new\nfaces were reliable fellas\nsuch as Amin, Michael,\nand Jacob, as well as a\nLord Farquaad impersonator and a nervous\nyoung fresher called Will\nAynsley (poor lad, he was\npractically shaking).\nSummer was officially\nover, and it was time\nto begin excavating\nthe long-buried rigs of\nICURFC in preparation\nfor Freshers\u2019Week and the\npromise of far-off ACC\nnights parading around\nthe union as Spartans.\nOnce gathered, the squad\nwas informed that the\nfirst session would be a\nrigorous fitness test to\nsee just how great our fall\nfrom grace had been over\nsummer. Upon hearing\nthese news, Lord Allingham of his father\u2019s estate\npromptly paid off the Sport\nImperial staff to feign a\nknee injury, and spent the\nrest of the training session\nloudly commentating as\neveryone else was put\nthrough their paces.\nWith fitness testing\nover, the next few\ndays got underway as\nexpected, the team gelling\ntogether over rugby and\nweights sessions. The\nnew coaching setup, now\njoined by Martin\u2019s broth-er-in-bicep Coach Lovejoy\nand led by flair-master\nCoach Will, was firing on\nall cylinders and we were\nbeginning to look like a\nreal squad again: Chopper\nwas chopping (people and\npints), Owen was sniping,\nAllingham was coaching,\nToby was watching\nother people train, and\nBlackett was breaking all\nthe promises he\u2019d made\nin the run-up to his Sabb\nelection; it was Imperial\nrugby as it should be.\nThe first of our two\npreseason matches,\nagainst King\u2019s, saw a tight\nfixture in which the new\ngame system was used\nto great effect in the first\nquarter but ultimately\ndropped off as our fitness\nlevels faltered. After a less\nsuccessful second half we\nended up with a 20-5 loss.\nHowever, not to be put\nout by this, the next night\u2019s\nannual Oxford social saw\na full turnout and a great\nnight on the town. One or\ntwo of the lucky Oxford\ngals even managed to bag\nthemselves a long, steamy\nnight of cuddling. Saucy.\nApart from that, preseason\nfinished successfully, a\nfriendly against Brunel\nUniversity took place,\nand more freshers than we\ncould anticipate showed\ntheir faces. Unfortunately,\nSylvia has yet to make an\nappearance (perhaps she\nheard about Brady\u2019s antics\nand decided to steer clear),\nbut apart from that we are\nready to hit the ground\nrunning in the new season\nand look forward to seeing\nall of our new members\nsoon!\nIf you\u2019re interested in\nIC Rugby, email rugby@\nic.ac.uk\nSPORTS\nVictoria Thompson\nIC Triathlon Club\nSPORTS\nAli Zaboronsky\nPress Officer\nPicture the idyllic Brecon Beacons.

He was just 18\nwhen he began to scrawl\npoetic graffiti on the\nstreets of New York with\none of his school friends\nAl Diaz as SAMO\u00a9 \u2013 a\ncontraction of \u2018same old,\nsame old shit\u2019. When the\nduo were exposed as the\nfigures behind SAMO\u00a9,\nBasquiat turned to creating\nart under his own name,\nfirst hawking handmade\npostcards outside New\nYork\u2019s galleries, and then\nworking on large scale\ncanvases.. His primitivist,\nneo-expressionist paintings drew the admiration\nof everyone from Keith\nHaring to Andy Warhol.\nHis raw, exuberant style\npaired with his tragically\nshort career \u2013 there was\nlittle more than half a\ndecade between his first\nsolo show and his death\nat the age of twenty-seven\nfrom an heroin overdose,\nhas mythologised Basquiat\ninto the annals of modern\nart history.\nThe photographs of\nSAMO\u00a9 reveal Basquiat\nand Diaz\u2019nascent attempts\nto shed light on inequality\nand their frustration at the\nlack of diversity in the\nart world through art, and\nsometimes cryptic tags.\n\u201cWhich institutions hold\nmost political power?\u201d\nreads one: \u201cthe church,\ntelevision, SAMO or\nMcDonald\u2019s?\u201d (the box\nfor McDonald\u2019s is ticked),\n\u201cSAMO as an end to\n9-to-5, \u2018I went to college\u2019,.\n\u2018not 2-nite honey\u2019 bluz\nthink\u201d. Basquiat\u2019s canvasses translate the insouciance of his graffiti into a\nhost of brilliantly vibrant\npaintings \u2013 a hastily\ndaubed double portrait of\nhimself and Warhol is not\ntechnically brilliant such\nfizzes with a magnetic\nenergy.\nThe rooms towards the\nend of the exhibition, filled\nwith works from the end\nof his career are the most\ncompelling. These show\nthe artist gaining maturity.\nBasquiat never went to art\nschool but his voracious\nappetite for learning from\nthe art canon is evident.\nHis adoption of elements\nfrom Picasso and Cy\nTwombly\u2019s work is easy\nto spot, yet Basquiat\u2019s\naffinity for the non-West-ern canon seems to have\ninfluenced him the most.\nHis thick pastel linework,\nheavy with scratchings,\nfigures jutting into patches\nof solid colour seem\nsculptural, reminiscent\nof African tribal rock\ncarvings.\nIn his later works\nBasquiat\u2019s began to\nexplore the themes of\nrace in America in greater\ndepth; references to\nslavery, the cotton and\nsugar trade abound. His\nwork also became more\ncontemplative.

We are\nleft with the sense that\nBasquiat himself is trying\nto synthesise his thoughts,\npainting as he thinks,\nmaking connections,\ndrawing threads of conclusion that aren\u2019t altogether\nclear to him, let alone to\nus.\nHis notebooks, where\nhe set down ideas and\nrefined the poetry he\u2019d\nlater graffiti are especially poignant. For all\nthe breadth of assembled\npieces, the spectre of\nwork unfinished hangs\nover the exhibition. I kept\nturning corners expecting\none flash of brilliance to\nbring it all together, but it\nnever came.

Naturally, I desperately wanted to experience all that. Thus, a few\nmonths ago I managed to\nmake it up north for the\nlast few days of the Fringe,\nand was overwhelmed by\nthe levels of energy and\ncreativity concentrated in\none city.\nEstablished in 1947, the\nFringe is now the world\u2019s\nlargest arts festival, with\n53,232 performances of\n3,398 shows in 300 venues\nat the festival this year.\nBilled as an open event\nwelcoming performers\nand groups from all over\nthe world, the Fringe is\nespecially known for its\ndiversity, with shows\nspanning across the\ngenres of theatre, comedy,\nimprov, spoken word,\ndance, physical theatre,\ncircus, cabaret, musicals\nand everything in between.\nIt is also known as the\nplace for newcomers to\nbreak out and be noticed.\nThe festival celebrates\nboth the mainstream and\nthe alternative, the edgy\nand the family-friendly,\nthe well-established acts\nand the newcomers.\nWhen I stepped out of\nthe train, what caught my\nattention most was how\nevery inch of available\nwall was covered with\ncolourful posters of any\nsize. \u2018Strong and Stable\nProductions present\nBrexit: The Musical\u2019 one\ndeclared. Extra fences had\nbeen set up for the purpose\nof accommodating the\ninfinite number of posters.\nWhat I found most\nattractive, however,\nwas the constant festive\natmosphere penetrating\nevery corner of the city.\nWalking around the\ncity that was at once so\nfamiliar yet to foreign, it\nfelt like everyone was in a\nmerry mood. The gardens\nin which I spent countless\nhours lying on the grass\nrevising had transformed\ninto the giant street food\nand bar area, with fairy\nlights strung across. Every\nstreet revealed a new\nsurprise venue, pubs that\nI never knew existed were\nsuddenly hosting stand-up\ncomedy shows.\nInitially worried that\nI did not have a detailed\nplan of what to see at what\ntime on which day, I eventually realised that those\nfears were unfounded and\nin fact it was a blessing\nin disguise that I had not\nplanned what to see. In\nmy four days there, I saw\nten shows, and it was\nthose that I spontaneously\nwalked into that turned out\nthe most impressive.\nOne of these impressive\nsurpriseswasTheCrossing\nPlace by Romantika, a\ntheatre company founded\nin Estonia but now operating across Sweden and\nthe UK. I was handed a\nflyer and saw that it was\n\u2018a visual theatre piece\nbased on the poetry of\nTomas Transtr\u00f6mer\u2019, and\nimmediately decided I\nwas going to see it \u2013 I love\nTranstr\u00f6mer\u2019spoetry.Minimalistic and powerful,\nthe piece was performed\non a top-floor studio\nspace, and consisted of\nthree identically-dressed\nmen using energetic,\nfull-body movements and\nintense facial expressions\nto convey the themes of\nloneliness, monotony\nand loss in Transtr\u00f6mer\u2019s\nwords, which they recite\nat the same time.\nAnother show I saw\nas a result of a flyer was\nthe Reduced Shakespeare\nCompany, which I had\nwanted to see since I\nwas a secondary school\nstudent in English class\nbeing shown their version\nof Romeo and Juliet. That\nwas a wonderful case of\nchildhood dream come\ntrue unexpectedly, and\nthey did not disappoint,\ndelivering a hilarious\namalgamation of Shakespearean tropes and plots\nin his alleged \u2018first play\u2019.\nOf all the shows I saw,\nhowever, the one that\nimpacted me the most and\nwhich I found the most\ninsightful and technically\nbrilliant was Mouthpiece,\na collaboration from\nCanada between Quote\nUnquote Collective and\nWhy Not Theatre. The\nset is simple \u2013 the stage is\ncompletely empty except\nfor a plain, white bathtub\nat the centre, and two\nwomen dressed in identical white strappy leotards.\nThe two women perform\nthe conversation within\nthe character, who has just\nlost her mother the night\nbefore and has to now go\nabout her day choosing her\nmother\u2019s casket, her dress\nfor burial, and arranging\nthe service. In an expertly\nexecuted and beautifully precise sequence\nof a capella harmony,\ndissonance, physicality,\nlighting and text, the\nstruggles of the modern\nwoman are revealed by the\nscintillating performances\nof Amy Nostbakken and\nNorah Sadava, as the\nprotagonist reflects on her\nmother\u2019s death and her\nsubsequent tasks. I am\nusually not a fan of \u2018nasty\nwomen\u2019 art that shouts too\nloudly in one\u2019s face, but\nthis was a subtle, elegant\nand nuanced portrayal of\nthe female psyche, quietly\nangry in the precision of\nits performance.\nThe Fringe provides\nsomething for everyone,\nand is a holistic artistic\nexperience as a whole. As\na wellspring of passion\nand creativity, I found it\ninspirational and hearten-ing, and will definitely be\nreturning for more.\nThis writer\u2019s virgin Fringe experience was marked by unexpected childhood dreams come true, favourite poetry\ncome to life, and an overdose of creative genius.\nMouthpiece by Amy Nostbakken and Norah Sadava at the 2017 Edinburgh Fringe // Joel Clifton\n\n"

An\nanimal without a nervous\nnet can\u2019t respond to its\nenvironment, so its odds\nof survival could be\nlikened to flipping a coin.\nHaving one was a real\nbreakthrough.\nLater on, the flatworm\ndeveloped a central\nnervous system, realizing\nthat it was more efficient\nto turn decision making\ninto a centralised process.\nFrom that point on, the\nanimal nervous system\ngrew and matured, gaining\nthe limbic system, the ne-ocortex, and more blocks\nthat would eventually\nform the brains of the first\nhumans. One of those\nhumans, approximately\n50,000 years ago, came up\nwith the idea of associating sounds with physical\nobjects \u2013 language \u2013 and\nour collective knowledge\nas a species took a giant\nleap.

For one,\nthe human brain remains\nthe most powerful and versatile supercomputer in the\nknown universe, running\non less power than most\nlaptops. A good explanation for why we have such\na hard time understanding\nour brains boils down to\nthis quote by Dr. Moran\nCerf, \u201cIf the human brain\nwere so simple that we\nwould understand it, we\nwould be so simple that\nwe couldn\u2019t\u201d.\nUltimately, the greatest\nchallenge we may face\nas a species could be\nunderstanding not some\noutlandish technology, but\nrather ourselves.\nTechnological hurdles\naside, it turns out not\neveryone is ready to jump\nthe gun on becoming a\ncyborg.

However, to\nsend students there by\ndefault operates under\nthe assumption that the\nservice is fit for purpose;\nin its current state, it most\ncertainly isn\u2019t.\nAccording to last year\u2019s\nMentality survey, 40%\nof students waited over 3\nweeks to be seen, with just\nunder a fifth of students\nwaiting over six weeks. If\na student is struggling, by\nthe time the counselling\nservice offers them help,\nthe moment has often\npassed. Moreover, each\nstudent is only offered a\nhandful of appointments\nper year, with a maximum\nof seven being offered\nto students most at risk.\nThese time constraints\nmean that students often\nfelt like they only received\ngeneric advice, could\nonly tackle superficial\nissues they were facing,\nand some reported feeling\nunder pressure to use the\nsessions as efficiently as\npossible which only ended\nup generating additional\nanxiety. One student even\nreported feeling like they\nwere burdening the service\njust by using it. Evidently,\nthe service that\u2019s supposed\nto be making students feel\nbetter isn\u2019t doing its job.\nThe service\u2019s biggest\nfailing is clearly its waiting\ntimes. An important part\nof mental health services\nis checking if there is\nany immediate risk to the\npatient, which cannot be\ndone weeks after they\u2019ve\nasked to be seen. It\u2019s not\nasking too much to have\na counselling service that\noffers initial appointment\nwithin a few days of\nenquiry, especially when\nother college services\noffer similar; Ethos has\nan online booking system\nfor activities and classes\nwhere you can even get\nsame day slots. The fact\nthat you can take an Ethos\ninduction on the same day\nas you booked it and yet\nhave to wait six weeks for\na counselling appointment\nis staggering, and just\ngoes to demonstrate how\noff college priorities are.\nNow, that\u2019s not to\nsay that the counselling\nservice is at fault. In fact,\nthey\u2019re doing the best they\ncan with what they\u2019ve\ngot \u2013 which is exactly the\nproblem. More impor-tantly, the issue with the\nservice is twofold: not only\nis the counselling service\nunderfunded, but it also\ndoesn\u2019t have any room\nto expand. The service\nis in some hidden-away\ncorridor in the Sherfield\nBuilding, with no more\nrooms to house counsellors even if the funds\nwere available. There\nisn\u2019t even a waiting room:\nyou just have to stand in\nthe corridor, awkwardly\nwaiting for the counsellor\nto call you in. Frankly,\nCube Faculty Building\nand significant sections of\nthe Sherfield Building; the\nmajority of the staff there\ndon\u2019t need to be located\non campus, let alone in\nsuch central locations.\nThere\u2019s plenty of room\nfor the counselling service\nto expand, it\u2019s just the\ncollege do not consider\nit important enough to\ninconvenience themselves\nwith the moving process.\nThe current status quo\nis not acceptable. With\nthe creation of the White\nCity campus, discussions\nare happening right now\nto decide what\u2019s moving\nto the new campus and\nwhat\u2019s staying in South\nKensington. This gives\nus the perfect opportunity\nto fight for counselling\nservice expansion, but this\nwill only succeed with\nstudent action behind it.\nTo find out more about the\ncampaign, come to ICU\u2019s\nWorld Mental Health Day\nevent on the 10th October,\nor email at icu-mental-health@ic.ac.uk. Help\nmake this the year where\nthings finally change!\nHere\u2019s what I\u2019m up\nto at the moment!\nS\ntepping into the newly-created role\nof Mental Health Liberation Officer, I\nwas acutely aware of the scale of the\nchallenges faced. In the Mentality\nSurvey, which was run two years ago, 70% of\nstudent at Imperial reported mental stresses\nor a mental health problem. It\u2019s so important\nthat we hit the ground running this year.\nWe\u2019ve organised our first major event of\nthe year: on Tuesday 10th October, World\nMental Health Day (WMHD), we\u2019re going to\nbe raising awareness of mental health, as\nwell as raising money for the Young Minds\ncharity. I\u2019ve organised a partnership between\nImperial College Union and Young Minds,\nwhich does fantastic work in promoting\nself-care, addressing mental health stigma,\nand encouraging young people to lobby the\ngovernment on mental health issues. If you\u2019re\ninterested, come along to Beit Quad next\nTuesday, where we\u2019ll be running a number of\ndifferent events \u2013 you can find out more info\nabout Young Minds, and see how student\nsocieties can make a difference at Imperial.\nI\u2019ve also been speaking to incoming\nundergraduate and masters students across\nImperial, about how the Union represents\nthem regarding mental health issues. It\u2019s vital\nthat all students at our university know about\nhow they can make their voices heard, and\nwhere they can turn to for help.\nHowever, there is no point in raising\nawareness if there is no commitment from\nthe College and faculty to increase the\nprovisions available to students. One of the\nmajor issues is that there simply isn\u2019t space\nfor the counselling service to expand \u2013 we\u2019re\nlaunching our campaign to pressure the\nCollege to change this on WMHD, so please\ncome along and ask me any questions you\nmight have about what we plan on doing.\nDuring the rest of the year I will be putting\npressure on the College \u2013 it\u2019s time that your\nvoices are heard, and real change is achieved.\nLIBERATION\nAriana Sadr-Hashemi\nMental Health Liberation\nOfficer\nStudents need more than awareness; they need proper support // Flickr/Hey Paul Studios\n\u201cThe current\nstatus quo of\nmental health\nprovision at\nImperial is not\nacceptable\u201d\nthe current location is just\nembarrassing.\nThis is a complete slap\nin the face when you\nconsider how much room\non campus is dedicated\nto college staff that have\nno contact with students\nwhatsoever.

The documentary\nfollows a group of divers\nand scientists documenting disappearing coral\nreefs across the globe. The\nteam used the technology\nbehind Google\u2019s Street\nView to create a set of\n360-degree images, allowing anyone with internet\naccess to take virtual dives\nat world-class dive spots.\nThey also conducted surveys to better understand\nchanging reef health.\nThe cause of the\ndisappearing reefs and,\narguably, the largest\ncurrent threat to reef ecosystems is coral bleaching,\na phenomenon caused by\nrising water temperatures.\nWhen water becomes\ntoo warm, coral polyps\nexpel their symbiotic\nalgae. Without the energy\nprovided by the algae\nmany corals starve, with\nknock-on consequences\nfor the rest of the ecosys-tem. Unfortunately this\nis an increasing problem,\nwith 2016 having one\nof the longest and most\nsevere global bleaching\nevents on record.\nOne area that has thus\nfar been spared is the Red\nSea. In spite of the high\ntemperatures experienced\nthroughout the summer,\nthe majority of corals have\nmanaged to avoid bleaching entirely, although\nsome localised outbreaks\nhave been reported. As a\nresult it has been proposed\nthat these corals could\nhelp to regenerate coral\ncommunities in other locations that have been lost\ndue to bleaching.\nThis highlights the crit-icality of protecting such\necosystems, and luckily\nthe corals here appear to be\nmore bleach-resistant than\nmost. Yet despite their resilience when it comes to\nbleaching, Red Sea corals\ndo face threats in the form\nof unsustainable shipping\npractices and increases in\ntourism. If the area is not\nfully protected, we therefore risk losing not only a\nbeautiful ecosystem, but\nalso an invaluable bank\nof corals that could help\nto mitigate the impact of\nfuture bleaching events.\nEnter Ahlan Aqaba\nScuba Diving Center.\nOwner Shadi Hatoky and\nhis team are the only PADI\ncentre in the area with a\nGreen Star Award, thanks\nto their collaborations\nwith Project AWARE in-novatives to conduct reef\nhealth surveys and \u2013 most\nimportantly \u2013 actively\nrid dive sites of trash.\nUpcoming partnerships\ninclude educational\nprojects with the Royal\nMarine Conservation\nSociety to improve public\nunderstanding of conser-vation. Ahlan Aqaba are\nleading by example when\nit comes to protecting the\nlocal area, and are also\nnow offering internships\nfor divers intending to\nacquire that coveted Divemaster certification.\nAside from the encouraging conservation efforts\nunderway, the diving in\nthe Red Sea is world class.\nThere are generally no\nstrong currents, palatable\nwater temperatures, and\nexcellent visibility. The\nspots on offer include\nthe majestic Japanese\nGardens, whose kaleidoscope of colour will keep\nyou entertained for as long\nas your tank has oxygen.\nThere\u2019s also a shipwreck,\nbest explored by night,\nfollowed by a top deck\nbarbecue and late night\nboat party. Overall, Aqaba\nis a fantastic place to\nspend a few days getting\nlost beneath the waves.\nFor more information\non Ahlan Aqaba diving\nand internships visit\ndiveinaqaba.com or\ncontact the Editor.\nI follow you, deep sea baby // Shadi Hatoky\nHopping to the stars and beyond\nK\nnown for everlasting stretches\nof desert and a\nmonopoly on\nmarsupials, Australia is\nnot a country commonly\naffiliated with the space\nabove us. But this is set\nto change in 2018: the\nAustralian government\nhave announced the\ncountry will launch a\nnational space agency,\nbringing them in line\nwith other countries like\nCanada (and importantly\nNew Zealand).\nThe government said\nthe development of a\nnational agency will\nassist Australian efforts\nin the global $330 billion\nspace industry, and hopes\nthe move will focus the\ncountry\u2019s economy on\ninnovation and science\nactivities. But it has said\nlittle else.\nWith no budget or\nspecific aims the agency\u2019s\nannouncement seems a\nlittle premature. This is\nnot to say, though, that\nthey aren\u2019t involved in\nthe world of space-related\nsciences. Australia rapidly\njumped on the satellite\nbandwagon back in 1967\nand images of astronaut\nNeil Armstrong\u2019s first\nsteps on the moon were\ntransmitted by NASA\u2019s\nHoneysuckle Creek\ntracking station inAustral-ia. Since then, however,\ngovernments have stalled\nat the prospect of creating\na space agency because of\nthe related cost.\nPrime Minister\nMalcolm Turnbull confirmed the agency would\nbe \u201csmall\u201d, though it is\nnot yet clear how much\nmoney will be allocated.\nThe government indicated the costing would\nbe included in the 2018\nfederal Budget.\nSo, what exactly is a\n\u2018space agency\u2019? And why\nwould a country that has\nhad been happily without\nfor half a century choose\nnow to form one?\nA space agency is an\nofficial organisation that\nbrings space exploration\nand satellite technology\nunder one branch of\nnational government. As\nexpected, of the 71 countries with space agencies,\nno two run theirs exactly\nSCIENCE\nOlly Dove\nScience Writer\nthe same, and each have\nslightly differing priorities.\nAustralia currently\nrelies on data collated by\nother countries\u2019 satellites.\nThis includes data used for\nsecurity and surveillance\npurposes. Under a national\nagency ,the 11,500 people\nworking in the space\nindustry would be able to\nrecord their own data and\nAustralia would have more\ncontrol over the information collected. Starting\nup the agency will not\nbe an easy or cheap task.\nHowever there is clearly\nspace for improvement.\n\u201cAustralia\njumped on\nthe satellite\nbandwagon\nback in 1967,\nbut the they\nhave since\nstalled at the\nprospect of a\nspace agency\u201d\nHow the Australian government plans to reach out to the great beyond with its first space agency\n\n"

I diligently wrote a\npiece, though seemingly\nmy first draft wasn\u2019t good\nenough for this highly\ncoveted newspaper and\nfor that I am tremendously sorry.

A guide to surviving your\nfirst year at Imperial\nTake it from a third year \u2013 there are some things that you should know now to make your first\nyear at university a lot easier\nCOMMENT\nThomas Carroll\nComment Writer\nD\near Freshers,\nSeeing as\nyou\u2019ve all\ndescended upon\ncampus to begin your\narduous journey towards\ngetting a pretty piece of\npaper from some people\nwith letters in front their\nnames, I thought I\u2019d tell\nyou a couple things I\u2019ve\nlearnt in my own time here.\nThese are four things that\nI\u2019ve learned about university that I think will help\nevery fresher get through\nfirst year \u2013 because a little\nheads up doesn\u2019t hurt.\nMake an effort to\nmeet people\nThis is probably one of\nthe most important things\nto do in the first term of\nuniversity \u2013 a good beginning here can set you\nup for success throughout\nyour degree and beyond.\nDuring the first term,\npeople are still forming\nfriendship groups and are\nopen to new people. It\u2019s\na socially-fluid situation,\nand requires work to make\nconnections with perma-nence. Identify people you\nthink are cool, and turn\nthem from \u2018people you\u2019ve\nseen once\u2019 into \u2018people\nyou know\u2019 by making the\neffort to meet them two\nor three more times. Once\nthat initial connection is\nmade it\u2019ll likely last for a\nwhile, and then you can\nsuss them out to see if\nyou actually get on with\nthem beyond the universal\n\u2018ooh-we\u2019re-both-freshersisn\u2019t-this-cool-but-also-alittle-scary\u2019.\nAs time goes on, people\nwill have started to form\nloose groups, and by the\ntime the end of first year\nrolls around they are a little\nbit more established. It can\nbe a little bit more difficult\nto \u2018break in\u2019 to an entirely\nnew friendship group, especially since people have\nless time for socialising\nin exam season. I\u2019m not\nsaying go to every mingle,\npub crawl, and club night\nat Metric \u2013 nobody\u2019s got\nthe time (or liver capacity)\nfor that. All I\u2019m saying is\nto make that initial effort\neven though it may be\nscary, and it\u2019ll pay itself\nback in a big way.\nA good thing to do is to\ntry and establish multiple\nsemi-independent social\ngroups: your halls friends,\nyour course friends, and\nyour society friends. This\nis useful if you accidentally leave a metal spoon in\nthat bowl of soup you\u2019re\nmicrowaving and the\nwhole thing explodes and\nnow everyone in halls\ncan\u2019t talk to you without\nmaking soup puns. If\nthis happens, take refuge\nin a different group,\nisolated from soup-related\ncatastrophes, and count\nyour blessings for having\nmultiple robust social\nsupport structures.\nAim for a 2:1 in first\nyear\nGrades in first year may\nnot count (or count very\nlittle) towards your final\ndegree, but they reflect\nmore than just your marks.\nFirst year is when you\u2019re\nlearning how to learn at\nuniversity. It\u2019s a very different style from secondary education, and getting\na handle on it in first year\nsets you up for success\nin the remaining years of\nyour degree. To be clear:\nno-one expects you to be\nmaking perfect notes in\nthe first week of lectures \u2013\nor even in your last week\n\u2013 and no-one expects\nyou to have it completely\nworked out by the end of\nfirst year. Developing your\npersonal learning style\nis essentially a process\nof trial and error that\nnever stops. You\u2019re never\nmay be an internship or\nplacement, or even a little\nproject on something\nunrelated to your degree.\nEither way, opportunities\nfor summer abound, but\nyou have to be looking\nout for them. Have this\nin the back of your mind\nthroughout the year, and\ndon\u2019t be afraid to inquire\nwhen you hear about\nsomething potentially cool\ngoing on in the summer.\nThere\u2019s every chance it\u2019ll\nhelp you figure out what\nyou may want to do after\nyou get that pretty piece\nof paper at the end of your\ntime at university.\nKeep an ear out for\npotential housing options\nWhere you live in\nsecond year, and who\nyou live with, can make\na big difference to your\nexperience.

The\ngovernment will also raise\nthe threshold at which\nloans must be paid back\nto \u00a325,000. Announced\nat the Conservative party\nconference in Manchester,\nthe pledges are part of an\n\u00a311 billion drive to win\nover young voters following their disappointing\nelection results, which\nsaw them lose 13 seats and\ntheir majority.\nDescribing the fee\nfreeze as part of a \u201cmission\nto make the UK a fairer\nplace\u201d may allow Theresa\nMay to dodge accusations\nof another U-turn. The\noriginal plan would have\nseen tuition costs rise\nyet again next year to a\nmaximum \u00a39,500 a year.\nAs part of the Teaching\nExcellence Framework\n(TEF), universities with\ngold and silver ratings\nwould be able to raise\ntheir fees in line with\ninflation. Institutions with\na bronze rating would also\nbe allowed to increase\ntheir costs but only by up\nto 50% of the inflationary\nuplift. Putting these plans\non ice raises doubts about\nthe value universities will\nplace on achieving a good\nTEF rating in the absence\nof a financial incentive.\nIf the fee cap is maintained in the long term,\naverage student debt\ncould fall from \u00a350,600 to\n\u00a349,800. According to the\nInstitute for Fiscal Studies,\n77% of current graduates\nwill not fully repay their\nstudent loans before the 30\nyear write off point. The\nlatest proposals, which\nwill slash average lifetime\nrepayments by around\n\u00a310,000, will see 83% of\ngraduates failing to pay\nback the total amount.\nThis means the only\nones who will benefit from\nthe tuition cost freeze are\nthe highest earners. An\nextra 6% will no longer\nrepay the full amount of\ntheir debt before having it\nwritten off. The 17% that\ndo completely pay back\ntheir loans will repay a\nlower amount overall.\nRaising the repayment\nthreshold will have an\nimmediate impact on\nthose earning \u00a321,000\nto \u00a325,000. Low-earners\n(who are already unlikely\nto pay back the full amount\nof their loan) will now\nrepay even less before\nhaving their student debt\nwritten off. According to\nThe Times, this represents\na saving of around \u00a31 each\nday. Those with salaries\nof \u00a326,500 will save \u00a3500\na year. However it is the\nmiddle-earners who will\nbenefit the most, some\nto the tune of \u00a315,700\naccording to the IFS.\nThe proposals were\nheralded as a \u201crevolution\u201d\n\u2013 enthusiastically in The\nTelegraph and sarcastically in The Mirror. Labour\ndubbed the changes\n\u201cdesperate\u201d and claimed\nthat the Conservatives\nhave \u201cno plans for young\npeople\u201d. More generally,\nthe reception has been\nlukewarm with many\nwelcoming the move but\nwarning that much more\nmust be done.\nTheresa May may have\npreempted this with her\nsuggestion of holding a\nmuch wider review into\ntuition fees. This could\ninclude the return of\nmaintenance grants, as\nrevealed this week in an\n\u201cexclusive\u201d by i (although\nCont. pg 3\nNEWS\nUnion changes\nhouse lager\nto Bud Light,\nsparking anger\nPAGE 3\nTECH\nElon Musk\u2019s\nplans to get\ninside your head\nPAGE 8\nBOOKS\n4321 kicks off\nour Booker Prize\nreviews\nPAGE 21\nSPORT\nICUAFC doesn\u2019t\nlike being\ncritiqued\nPAGE 32\nTories promise to keep your tuition fees on ice // Joe O\u2019Connell-Danes\n\n"

Unfortunately, each\nof this years stories serves\nthe end goal of reaching\nthe resolution of Beth\nand Jerry\u2019s divorce. It\u2019s\nthis rush to resolve this\nplotline by the end of the\nseason that pushes what\ncould have been fantastic\nstandalone adventures to\nthe side, instead making\nthem slaves to the season\u2019s\nnarrative.\nCast your minds back to\nearly April, when Roiland\nand Harmon teased us\nwith an early April Fool\u2019s\nepisode, one devoted to\nbreaking one of our titular\ncharacters out of a mind\nprison. For four months\nwe were left up the creek\nwithout any zany, nihil-istic, Sci-Fi paddles. It is\nmaybe because of this time\nbetween this first episode\nand the rest that leaves\nThe Rickshank Rickdemption feeling more like the\nsecond half of last year\u2019s\nfinale, rather than a fresh\nstart to season three.\nSeason three doesn\u2019t\nreally kick off until the\nthird episode, Pickle Rick,\nwhich is a fairly bread and\nbutter episode that would\nfit thematically into any of\nthe three seasons. Like The\nWhirly Dirly Conspiracy\nand Rest and Ricklaxation,\nthis is as close as we get to\na true standalone episode\nthis year. Still, Rick spends\nmost of this episode\navoiding dealing with the\nissue of his daughter\u2019s\ndivorce, something I wish\nthe shows creators would\nhave done too.\nEpisode continuity can\nbe a fantastic way to keep a\nmay have made the series\nso successful to begin\nwith, the actual result is\nto render many of the key\nplot points irrelevant.\nPerhaps realising this\nshortcoming, we are\ntreated to what is easily\none of the strongest and\nmost complex episodes yet\nin The Ricklantis Mixup.\nThe gimmick of having\nevery character be a Rick\nor a Morty is much more\nthan that, as having these\nblank canvases allows\nthem to both assume\ncultural tropes and remain\nrecognisable and familiar.\nThe fact that the episode\nis literally Justin Roiland\ntalking to himself for 23\nminutes takes nothing\naway from the density of\nstorytelling in this episode.\nIt culminates in a dramatic\ndolly out, accompanied by\nthe recurring theme for the\nseries\u2019 darkest moments\nDo You Feel It? which\neagle-eared fans might\nremember from that time\nRick tried to kill himself.\nPlacing this episode in\nthe middle of the season,\nhowever, is like having\nyour cake before your\nsteak, especially as the\nseason ends on a dry,\nunremarkable tale that\ncould have fit into any\npart of the season, save\nfor the fact that Beth and\nJerry finally get over their\nthroughout the season.\nHowever, the small\ninsights into Morty\u2019s\ndeleted memories we do\nget is lighthearted and fun.\nWell, as lighthearted as\na story about a suspected\npeaodophile\u2019s suicide can\nget.\nThe last episode is a\nthematic continuation\nof The ABC\u2019s of Beth,\nthe first real time Beth\u2019s\ncharacter complexity is\nactually explored. This development comes across\nas retroactive considering\nwe have known these\ncharacters for 28 episodes\nalready. However, it does\nalso serve to end the\nseason, with a disposable\ntaleaboutthePresidentand\nreturn to both the family\nand premise we loved in\nthe first two seasons. Let\u2019s\njust hope that this season\nwas a necessary evil for\nRick and Morty\u2019s return to\nthe quality we had come to\nexpect.\nCatch the last episode\nof Season 3 on Netflix and\nAdult Swim this Sunday, if\nyou haven\u2019t pirated it like\nyou should have done.\nEveryone\u2019s favourite neglectful Grandfather has graced our screens and left almost as schwiftly as he arrived with\na season that presses the reset button on last years finale\nCould you pass the interdimensional salt? // The Rickshank Rickdemption, Rick and Morty\nRICK AND MORTY\nSEASON 3\nCreator: Dan Harmon,\nJustin Roiland. Starring:\nJusin Roiland, Chris Parnell,\nSpencer Grammer, Sarah\nChalke\n\u201cWe are\ntreated to\none of the\nstrongest and\nmost complex\nepisodes yet\u201d\nshow feeling like a living,\nbreathing world. But when\nthe last episode negates\nthe whole reason we have\nspent so much time on the\ndevelopment of our characters it feels cheap and\nfrustrating, as we know\nhow good this show can\nbe at its best. Whether to\nstart afresh with the many\nstory opportunities that\na full family offers, or an\nattempt to recapture what\n\u201cA dry,\nunremarkable\ntale that would\nfit into any part\nof the season\u201d\nirritating divorce. The\ndisappointing climax has\nled to many fans speculating that there are more\nepisodes to be released,\nand that the season isn\u2019t\nreally over. As much as\nI\u2019d like to believe this too,\nto do so is to make the\nsame error that befell fans\nof Sherlock, and afford\nan initially promising\nshowrunner far too much\ncredit. Sometimes a disappointing ending really is\njust that.\nWhile I appreciate\nHarmon and Roiland\u2019s\ntwist on a clip show,\ncramming all of this\nseason\u2019s standalone\nadventures into Morty\u2019s\nMindblowers was short\nsighted, as they would\nhave been welcome as\nfully fledged episodes\n\n"

It\u2019s also\nHollywood\u2019s go-to\nlocation for all movies\nMartian, which tells you\nall you need to know about\nthe kind of landscapes\non offer. I was initially\ndubious about spending\nseveral days of a short trip\nsurrounded by endless redness but, in the end, Wadi\nRum proved to be nothing\nshort of spectacular.\nIt\u2019s the perfect place to\nunwind with a good book\nor meditate in silence\namong the stillness. Or,\nfor the more energetically\ncharged, it also offers\nendless sandstone and\ngranite mountains to scale.\nAnd that\u2019s before the sun\nsets and the stars rise.\nIf you were interning in\nLondon over the summer,\nyou\u2019ve probably forgotten\nwhat stars look like. Well,\nI\u2019ll remind you: they\u2019re\nmagical twinkles of hope,\na testament to the beauty of\nthe cosmos, and a symbol\nof both your irrelevance\nand insignificance, something you probably need\nreminding of if you\u2019ve\nbeen stuck on a trading\nfloor all summer.\nThe Nabateans, of Petra\nfame, left their mark in\nthe form of graffiti, rock\npaintings, and temples.\nNowadays, Wadi Rum is\nhome to several communities of Bedouin, nomadic\npeople living across the\ndeserts of NorthAfrica and\nthe Middle East. While\nsome Bedouins have abandoned their nomadic traditions in favour of a more\nmodern lifestyle, many\ngroups have retained their\ntraditional practices of tent\nknitting, arts and crafts,\nand clan structures. Many\nsuch groups are very much\nopen to outsiders, who\noften act as a main source\nof income.\nOne of the issues faced\nby Bedouin communities\nis the complete erosion\nof traditions in favour\nof western comforts, a\nprocess facilitated by\ncertain types of tourism.\nNew fancy desert camps\nare emerging all the time,\ntending towards ugly,\nself-contained \u2018pods\u2019 in\nplace of traditional tents.\nSuch camps threaten to\ndisplace local people and\nruin the pristine land-scapes. Meanwhile, excessive around-the-clock\nair conditioning within\nthe pods contributes to the\nclimate change.\nThankfully,somecamps\nare refusing to abandon\ntraditions by offering an\nauthentic Bedouin experience instead of luxury,\none that respects local\nindigenous history and\nculture. That\u2019s not to say\nthat there\u2019s a sacrifice in\ncomfort or quality: the\nmore traditional camps\nare perfectly pleasant and\nsuitable for both backpackers and families alike.\nOne standout camp is\nRahayeb Desert Camp,\nwhose simple quarters,\nfound in a peaceful\nlocation within the protected area, offer a true escape\nfrom the chaos of the\nnewer camps. The staff are\nfriendly and knowledgea-ble, and provide support in\norganising camels, jeeps,\nchicken and lamb, slow-cooked beneath the sand.\nThis is by far the best base\nfrom which to explore the\nsurrounding area.\nFinally, no trip to Wadi\nRum would be complete\nwithout escaping the\nMartian rock immersion\nto appreciate its true magnitude from 4,000 feet.\nIn fact, the Royal Aero\nSports Club of Jordan was\nfounded by King Abdullah\nafter discovering the thrill\nof flying and seeing the\nbeauty of the country from\nabove. This non-profit\norganisation now offers\nactivities, such as hot air\nballoon rides, from which\nyou can really appreciate\nthe magnificence of the\narea. The panoramic views\nare out of this world and\nnot to be missed.\nFor more information\nvisit rahayebdc.com,\nrascj.com, or contact the\nEditor.\nChris Richardson\nTravel Writer\nChris Richardson goes full Bedouin in Jordan\u2019s answer to Mars\nTRAVEL\n\u201cWadi Rum is\nHollywood\u2019s\ngo-to location\nfor all movies\nMartian, which\ntells you all\nyou need to\nknow about\nthe kind of\nlandscapes on\noffer\u201d\n\u201cThe food is\nfantastic, and\nincludes the\nzarb, a Bedouin\nbanquet\nof chicken\nand lamb,\nslow-cooked\nbeneath the\nsand\u201d\nsandboarding, and other\nactivities in the area.

Over 400 roles are\nopen to students, including positions on the new\nWellbeing Representation Network (WBRN).\nThe nominations, which\nopened on 30th September\nwill remain open until the\nend of next week, closing\non 12th October. Other\npositions include roles on\nthe Academic Representation Network (ARN)\n\u2013 a body of students\nresponsible for feeding\nback educational issues\nto their department \u2013 Ordinary Council Members,\nConstituent Union roles,\nand the Gender Equality\nLiberation Officer.\nThis is the first year that\nthe WBRN is being run.\nThe scheme is \u201cunique\namong British universities\u201d, and modelled on\nthe existing ARN. The\nUnion\u2019s definition of\n\u2018wellbeing\u2019 covers five\nkey areas where support\nis available to students:\n\u2018Health\u2019, \u2018Financial Concerns\u2019, \u2018Relationships\u2019,\n\u2018Equality and Diversity\u2019,\nand \u2018Personal Safety\u2019.\nThe WBRN consists\nof 85 student volunteers,\nfrom across all depart-ments: there will be one\n\u2018Departmental Wellbeing\nRepresentative\u2019 for each\nUG department, and one\n\u2018Year Wellbeing Representative\u2019 for each year of\na course. Each representative within the Network\nwill have to complete\na mandatory induction\ndelivered by the Union.\nSome representatives will\nalso receive Mental Health\nFirst Aid training, which\nwill not be mandatory;\nadditional training will be\nmade available throughout\nthe year, focusing on\nvarious aspects of wellbe-ing.\nThe framework has\nbeen arranged under a\nCASPER framework:\nreps are responsible for\n\u201cCampaigning, Awareness\nraising, Signposting, Promoting positive conversa-tions, Early intervention,\nand Representation\u201d.

Since Wellbeing\nReps will be obliged to\nreport issues they have\nbeen presented with by\ntheir peers, it has the\npotential to find out what\ntruly affects students.\u201d\nHe went on to say that\nCGCU would be using the\nWBRN to gather data on\nwellbeing in their Faculty\nto determine differences\nbetween year groups.\nHowever, some student\nrepresentatives have concerns about the WBRN:\nMichael Edwards, RCSU\nPresident, said that\nwhile the network has \u201ca\nsignificant potential to\nmake a lot of change\u201d, the\nUnion needs to \u201crealise\nthat one of the costs will\nbe the well-being of the\nstudents that take up\nthese roles in the trial\nyears.\u201d Abhijay Sood,\nRCSU Academic Affairs\nOfficer, raised issues with\nhow the WBRN had been\ndeveloped: \u201cIf the Union\nreally gave a damn about\ndemocracy, they\u2019d have\nconsulted properly with\nstudents; there wasn\u2019t so\nmuch as a vote at Council\non this...if the Union ever\ndoes anything this big\nagain, we need to make\nsure they tell us ahead of\nare already doing: \u201cI am\nconcerned that the Union\nhas too much work to do\nalready, and this will only\nworsen things\u201d, said one\nstudent representative.\nAnother student told\nFelix: \u201cThe Union has\na lot of problems \u2013 not\nhaving enough roles isn\u2019t\none of them.\u201d\nO\u2019Connor told Felix:\n\u201cWe have spoken at length\nto a small number of students who had legitimate\nconcerns about the safety\nof Wellbeing Reps, and\nwe are grateful for their\nviews, which have helped\nimprove it. Their concerns\nwere often ones that we\nhad already identified our-selves, and we have put\nthe safety of our members\nat the heart of our planning\nfor this Network.\u201d\nNominations close next\nThursday.

And if\nthe latter, why are you\nstudying Mech Eng at\nall?\nO: I like the idea of it being a future career; the\nglamour of being a professional in the film or theatre world. I have looked\naround for jobs in the theatre sector \u2013 acting, direct-ing, getting into writing at\na ground level \u2013 by sending out works I\u2019ve done\nand seeing if people like it,\nand I\u2019ve looked for jobs in\nengineering. But I priori-tise the engineering.\nI\u2019m in the position of\nenjoying my subject as\nwell as really enjoying the\ndrama I do on the side. I\nwouldn\u2019t mind a career\nin either, but a job in engineering would be a lot\nmore profitable and safe.\nIf I went into engineering\nI\u2019d still do a lot of drama\nin my spare time and if I\nwent into drama I\u2019d still\ndo a lot of engineering in\nmy spare time.*\nenjoyable. I\u2019ve not been\ntrawling towards the end\nof the degree wishing it to\nend. But there are people\nI know who have started\ntheir degrees and fallen\nso in love with acting,\nwriting and directing that\nthey\u2019ve left after two\nyears and gone to acting\nschool. And a lot have\nbeen success stories. I\nthink a lot of that stems\nfrom the fact we\u2019re in the\ntheatre capital of Europe.\nIt\u2019s intoxicating. And to be\nat a STEM university with\nno competition from those\nstudying arts, it\u2019s easy to\nget taken away with that.\nI\u2019m lucky enough to be\nable to appreciate both\nsides of that life.\n*Seriously, he\u2019s telling\nthe truth. The man has a\nburning passion for fixing\nthings.\nRhodes must fall: a passionate retelling of a real-life\nstudent revolution\nT\nold through a series of compelling\nmonologues, The\nFall is a drama-tisation of the real events\nsurrounding a group of\nactivist students studying\nat the University of Cape\nTown (UCT), several decades after apartheid. Specifically, it tells the story behind the fall of the\nstatue of colonialist Cecil\nRhodes, which stood for\nyears outside the University as a staunch reminder of\nthe violent events that unfolded over a century ago.\nThrough the discussions\nand personal accounts\ngiven by the seven-strong\nensemble cast, the major issues affecting their\nlives as regular students\nare explored. Through a\nclash of personalities the\nsignificance of race, class,\npatriarchy and gender in\nmodern-day South Africa\nraises questions on how\nto bridge the gaps in-be-tween through dialogue\nabout decolonisation.\nWritten by the cast\n- who are playing them-selves, the play draws on\ntheir own experiences,\nbuilding a deep narrative\nsurrounding the events\nthat happened.\nEach cast member has\na definitive attitude, and\ntells the story in a way that\nreflects their own iden-tity; be it the headstrong\nBoitshoko who comically wants to take on the\nstatue using \u201ca chisel and\nhammer\u201d, to the young\nChwaita who is struggling to find her voice in\nthe group, constantly asking questions about what\nexactly they\u2019re striving\nfor. Lead by the incredible Zandile Madliwa as\nthe leader of the Black\nRadical Feminist move-ment, and Cleo Raatus as\na non-binary council rep,\nthe play lights up with intensity when the students\nconfront each other and\nbegin to find deeper understanding through a series of strongly worded ar-guments. Ameera Conrad,\nwho plays Camilla, was\nparticularly impressive\nduring her fiery speech\nthat divides the group and\nthrusts gender issues into\nthe limelight.\nThe scenes are interspersed with impressive\nchoreography and traditional song, echoing the\nstrong collective spirit they have as a group\nto address the needs of\ntheir country. In the short\nspace of 80 minutes, the\naudience were taken on a\nroller coaster of emotions,\nlaughing at the naivety of\nquestions and comedic\nchides to crying alongside\ncharacters forced to make\ndifficult moral decisions.\nProjections of the real-life\nprotests that happened following the #RhodesMust-Fall movement centre the\nplay synchronously alongside the history of the\nmovements.\nWhilst the stories are\ntold with colour and pas-sion, the way they are effortlessly interweaved to\nfollow a historically-ac-curate narrative makes\nyou come out of it feeling\njust as enlightened as you\nwere entertained.

But as it turns out, there are a bunch of\narts-loving, STEM-studying students here. In the first of a series of interviews on the topic, Arts Editor Adam Gellatly\ninterviews DramSoc President Oscar Gill.\nARTS\nAdam Gellatly\nArts Editor\nO\nscar Gill is a 4th\nyear Mech Eng\nStudent and\nsitting President\nof Imperial DramSoc. He\nwas also my flatmate for\n2 years and we\u2019re right\nold chums. We sat down\nover a mediocre cup of\nSCR coffee to discuss his\nrelationship with the arts\nwhile studying at Imperial.\nAdam: Can you briefly describe what arts\nyou\u2019re interested in\nand how you\u2019re involved with the arts\nat Imperial?\nOscar: I\u2019m interested in\nthe performing arts, and\nin particular, theatre; so\nthat\u2019s anything from mu-sicals, to comedies, to\nShakespeare. I got interested in it quite a while\nago. My entire family are\nthespians, everybody\u2019s\ncome from some theatrical background. I was involved [in theatre] quite a\nlot growing up, but during\nmy A-Levels I didn\u2019t do\nanything at all and felt really bad about it. So, when\nI went into 1st\nyear, I was\nreally determined to get\ninto a play as soon as I\ncould. I found the Imperial Dramatic Society and it\nwent from there.\nNow, as the President I\nexecutive produce every\nsingle DramSoc show that\nis performed during my\ntenure; making sure there\u2019s\na production team, and a\nproducer and director that\nwork together. As well as\nthat my duties extend to\nmanaging the committee,\nwhich consists of the\nacting and technical side.\nA: There\u2019s a perception from the outside\nthat Imperial students are only interested in their chosen\nSTEM degree. Can\nyou talk more about\nyour own experience\nof balancing interests\nin Mech Eng and the\nperforming arts?\nO: A lot of people tend\nto mix their skills from\ntheir degree with what\nthey do in their clubs and\nsocieties. I like to keep\nthem completely sepa-rate. Everything I do in\nMechanical Engineering\nis different to what I do in\nDrama. And I like that di-vide; it means I can take a\nbreak from one and do the\n\u201cEverything\nI do in\nMechanical\nEngineering\nis different to\nwhat I do in\nDrama.\u201d\n\u201cI have looked\nfor jobs in\nacting.... and\nI\u2019ve looked\nfor jobs in\nengineering.\nBut I\nprioritise the\nengineering.\u201d\nother.\nOther people definitely\nview us as a STEM university and that\u2019s tricky\nat times. When you come\nhere you don\u2019t expect\narts to be a big thing, but\nit really is. I feel that the\nmost when DramSoc goes\nto the Edinburgh Fringe\nFestival. ICL has almost\nno name to work with and\nit\u2019s difficult to get over\nthat perception of being\nat STEM university and\nproving that we are artistically talented.\nA: How do you get\nover that?\nO: In recent years, we\u2019ve\ntried to massively expand\nour image over London by\ntaking part in the London\nStudent Drama Festival.\nAll the colleges in London\nget together and compete\nwith a piece of drama written by themselves. All of\nthem are critiqued by professional writers and crit-ics. It allows us to show\nwhat Imperial is made of\nand mingle with the other\nuniversities, which I think\nis very important in creating the image of arts at\nImperial as being a \u2018real\u2019\nthing.\nA: Do you think the\nquality of Imperial\u2019s\ndramatic output suffers from the fact that\nno one studies acting,\nor writing here?\nO: I think it can be prob-lematic. But we\u2019re not trying to put out the highest\nquality drama as STEM\nstudents. The society is\nan amateur theatre group\nand quality is something\nwe aspire to. At times it\u2019s\nhard to achieve that, not\nbecause of the people we\nhave \u2013 because we have\ntalented people \u2013 but because of the time commitments people have with\ntheir subjects. Degrees\nlike medicine, like engi-neering, are very full-on\nand don\u2019t leave a lot of\ntime for people to practice\nand improve their artistic\nside.\nA: When you look at\na group like the Cambridge Footlights,\nwho also have non-arts members, they\nseem to have an aim\nto produce high-qual-ity material. Do you\nthink at Imperial it\u2019s\nless about that and\nmore about the \u2018club\u2019\naspect of the society?\nO: To an extent, yes. The\nCambridge Footlights\nhave a tendency to produce high-quality stuff,\nbut they also have the\nexpectation to do so. But\nhaving seen a lot of the\nFootlights productions at\nthe Fringe this year, I can\nsay that a lot of it is sub-standard. They\u2019re in a similar boat to us \u2013 working\nhard on their degrees \u2013 but\nthey also have the pres-tige. We don\u2019t have that,\nand although that\u2019s unfor-tunate, it takes a lot of the\npressure off. So essential-ly, you\u2019re right, we\u2019re a\nclub. People need to join\nit not with the aspiration\nof producing something\nthat is ground-breaking,\nbut because they want to\nhave fun with it and want\nto create something they\nhaven\u2019t had a chance to\nbefore.\nA: Do you find your\nfellow actors are like\nyou, in that this is\nsomething they\u2019ve\ndone before, or do\nmost have zero acting\nexperience?\nO: It varies. Maybe 70:30\nto people who have acted before. But the way I\nlook at it, anyone can act,\nit doesn\u2019t take a lot. I\u2019ve\nsold it people on that be-fore, and people with no\nexperience have tried it\nOscar performing in Flour, 2016 // Fadhi Kanavati\n10\n\n"

It is at once all the\nthings I find difficult about\nthe performance, and what\nseems essential to the\nspirit of the original novel\nwhich is itself a howl for\nwomen\u2019s independence\nand self-determination.\nAdapting any novel as\nconcerned with a single\nprotagonist\u2019s inner experiences as Jane Eyre is an\nunenviable task. Director\nSally Cookson has tackled\nthis issue with aplomb:\nthere is much to admire in\nher reimagining.\nFirst staged as a two-part play at the Bristol\nOld Vic in 2014, the production spent a short spell\nat the National Theatre\nthree years ago, toured the\ncountry, and is now back\nin London. It remains\nan inventive sensory\nexperience that despite\nits strengths sometimes\nbecomes too enmeshed\nin its complex theatrics \u2013\nbecoming a showcase of\nstyle over substance.\nEschewing 19th\ncentury\naesthetics, Michael Vale\u2019s\nset is a stripped down, bare\nbones two-level stage has\nbeen built around a three-man band. The simple\nstage acts as a background\nto bold lighting and cho-reography. The company\nclambers up and down\niron ladders in a frenzy of\nmovement accompanied\nby Benji Bower\u2019s modern\nfolk score. Some scenes\nare punctuated with song\n\u2013 Melanie Marshall\u2019s\nmellifluous voice soars\nabove the strings. The\nproduction would not be\nhalf as successful without\nMarshall who, it quickly\nemerges, is not merely narrating the story but is the\nvoice of the \u2018mad-woman\u2019\nBertha Mason. Cookson\u2019s\ntreatment of Bertha is a\ntriumph: not only is she\nallowed out the attic room\nin which she is incarcerated in the novel and given\na voice, she is also given\none of the most memorable scenes in the play.\nThe sequence in which\nMarshall belts out a hauntingly gothic rendition of\n\u2018Mad About the Boy\u2019 was\nspine-tinglingly good.\nOther dramatic flourishes threaten to overshadow\nthe substance of the play in\nsome parts however. In the\ntransitions in which Jane\ntravels from Gateshead\nto Lowood, the company\ncongregates around Nadia\nClifford to form a human\ncoach, jogging on the\nspot to mimic its journey\nthrough the countryside.\nNovel at first, by the\nsecond time it seems\nindulgent. Similarly, Paul\nMundell\u2019s embodiment of\nthe dog, Pilot, is played to\ngreat comedic effect, but\nPatchy in parts, Sally Cookson\u2019s adaptation remains a worthy staging of the much beloved novel\nNo net ensnares her: Nadia Clifford as Jane Eyre // Brinkhoff M\u00f6genburg\nWhere? The National\nTheatre\nWhen? until 21st\nOct\nHow Much? from \u00a315\nJANE EYRE\n\u201cClifford in\npartcular\nis superb,\nscrappy and\nrebellious as a\nchild\u201d\n\u201cDramatic\nflourishes\nthreaten to\novershadow\nthe substance\nof the play in\nsome parts\u201d\nhis enthusiastic portrayal,\ncomplete with panting\nand wagging tail, detracts\nrather than adds to the\nweight of some of the crucial scenes between Jane\nand Rochester.\nMuch like the novel,\nthe play comes into its\nown at Thornfield. There,\nthe chemistry between\nNadia Clifford in the\neponymous role, and Tim\nDelap, playing Rochester,\nis electric. Clifford in particular is superb, scrappy\nand rebellious as a child,\nself-assured with a hidden\nsteeliness as a woman.\nDespite excellent\nperformances, timing remains an issue. The three\nhour run-time is at once\nexhausting and too short\nto do the novel justice. It\u2019s\nat Lowood, the tyrannical\nboarding school Jane attends in her youth, that the\nplay seems truncated. We\nhave been scarcely introduced to Jane\u2019s only friend\nand solace at the establish-ment, Helen, when she\ndies. We never really feel\nthe impact her friendship\nand her subsequent death\nhas on Jane. Similarly,\ntowards the end of the\nplay, Jane\u2019s time with the\nRivers feels rushed. The\nhour that was cut in order\nto accommodate the play\nas a single performance in\nits transition from Bristol\nmay well have smoothed\nboth the beginning and the\nend of the production.\nCharlotteBront\u00eb\u2019snovel\ntook the literary world by\nstorm when it was first\npublished in 1847, with\nits strong fiery heroine and\nits undercurrent of sexual\ncharge, it was unlike any\nother novel of the time,\nespecially not one written\nby a woman. Cookson\u2019s\nadaptation attempts to\nbring that revolution to the\nstage \u2013 it\u2019s a shame that\nit chooses to focus much\nof its time on thrilling the\naudience with dramatic\nstaging as it\u2019s when the\nactors are left alone to tell\nthe story simply is when\nthe production is at its\nmost powerful.\n\n"
