    "content": "Opinion 23\nImperial CollegeA Wasteland Of Mindlessness\nDear Felix,\nThe malaise which is destroying Imperial\nCollege is often said to be the apathy of the\nstudents - in fact, it is far worse than that. The\ntrue problem is that the people here just have no\ndesire to think. In a place which lays claim to\nsome 7,000 of the highest IQs in the country,\nthis is purely absurd. The atmosphere should be\nbuzzing with intellectual discovery - instead, it\nis a wasteland of mindlessness.\nThere was once a time when people went to\nuniversity because they wanted to learn, to\nquestion, to understand. Nowadays they come to\nImperial for nothing more than to let their minds\nstagnate in a boorish atmosphere of beer and\nnicotine smoke.\nWhy do these 'students' (and I use that term\nadvisedly) have no interest in studying? Those\nfew who dare to express an interest in learning\nanything, who have the insolence to mention\npolitics, philosophy, or art for instance, are\nridiculed - \"what's that got to do with your\nsubject?\" say the bovine herds. Don't they want\nto understand the world they live in? They even\nderide those who express an interest in their\nchosen field of study.\nA place like Imperial should be a nucleus of\nideas, its rooms pulsing with debate. The JCR\nshould be an Utopian forum for discussion,\nscientific enquiry and political tirades - instead\nit is an Atopia of self-satisfied mindlessness.\nOf course, there are a few surviving enclaves\n- the debating society struggles on, Felix still\nprovides a platform for the few who still have\nviews to air. Some people even have the\ncuriosity to attend voluntary lectures.\nAnd yet, the mindlessness still spreads. The\nstudents close their eyes, provide automatic\nanswers to automatic questions. Gone are the\npolymaths and auto did acts, to be replaced by\nblab bering sloths. No more can Imperial hope to\nproduce another Einstein, a Da Vinci or a Bertrund Russell. A few minor engineers and\naccountants maybe, but nothing more.\nSo what has happened? Much of the blame\ncan be laid on the education system, which\nchannels people into this narrow-minded\nacceptance, but the real blame lies with the\nstudents themselves. They don't care because\nit's easier to switch yourself off, to repeat what\nyou've been spoon fed all your life - it's just so\ndamn easy not to think. Maybe they should just\nstop for one second to ask themselves, \"Do I want my life to be worthwhile, or not?\".\nYours,\nMarcus Alexander\nMech Eng 2\nCredits\nPrinter: Theatre:\nAndy Thompson Rekha Nayak\nTypesetter: Features:\nRose Atkins Owain Bennallack (Ed)\nBusiness Manager: Layout & Proofing:\nSimon Govier Kin Wei Lee\nAdvertising Manager: Collators Last Week\nSteve Newhouse Tony Grew\nIvan Chan\nNews: Joe McFadden\nMichael Ingram Penguin\nLynn Bravey Steve Newhouse\nJoe McFadden Jon Jordan\nOwain Bennallack\nPuzzles:\nPenguin Collators from the\nSphinx final issue last term\nJaymz (as promised)\nJon Jordan\nPhotography: Owain Bennallack\nMike Chamberlain Simon Shaw\nDiana Harrison Tamsin Braisher\nIvan Chan Tim St Clair\nPenguin\nBooks: Steve Newhouse\nJuliette Decock Ivan Chan\nJoe McFadden\nMusic: Michael Ingram\nJon Jordan Diana Harrison\nPatrick Wood\nCinema: and thanks to IC Radio\nJoe McFadden for the disco speakers\nThe Munster Road Kitchen\nby Samin Ishtiaq\nNils' TV is, I think, sometimes more trouble that\nit's worth. Let me explain. Last year Nils bought\nthis great big f**k off (as Matt says) television\nset from a shop in Tottenham Court Road. It\nwasn't the most technologically-advanced set: it\nwas basically just the largest set they had.\n(Yeah, it would be interesting to do some kind\nof Freudian analysis on this. Are television sets\npost-modern symbols of male virility? If so,\ndoes Nils suffer from the male version of penis-envy?)\nNils was under the impression that the shop\nwould deliver it for free - and was taken back\nwhen the delivery guy asked him for ate nner. That was soon sorted out. But not before Paul\nhad to lug the television set all the way back to\nW l so that Nils could check that he had indeed\ngot the biggest one (TV set, that is).\nThankfully, our previous landlady (also\nknown as 'stupid cow') failed to notice the\nmassive dents in the hall and the stairway, where\nPaul let the television slip.\nIt does weigh a ton and a half, as Matt and I found out when we had to transport the TV to\nour current place. On the first flight of stairs I was at the bottom, so that the entire weight of\nthe TV was on me. 'F**k that for a game of\nsoldiers', I thought and on the next flight\nswapped places with Matt. I did feel slightly\nsafer - though I did keep on thinking about the\nexcuse I'd made to Matt's mum when I eventually did let the TV slip and squash Matt.\n(Notice how in all this Nils never got to do\nthe hard work of moving the TV once.\nSomehow, he always seems absent when heavy\nshifting has to be done.)\nOur current problem with the TV is the na ff reception. We don't seem to have an outside\naerial in this place. Matt did attempt to hook\nsomething up once, but being a past STOIC\nchairman (sorry, chairperson) he couldn't actually complete the job, could he now?\nThough I think I 've fixed the reception - and\nin a typical computing/bod gy way. There's a particular way to blue-tack the small aerial onto\nthe wall, sideways, that gives excellent reception\nfor BBC2 and Channel 4. Of course, since these\nare the only channels worth watching, the rest of\nthem can go jump in a lake.\nSMALL ADS DramSoc Auditions will be held for 'Doctor\nand the Devils' at 5.30pm in the Table Tennis\nRoom (top floor of the Union Building) on\nWednesday 26th January.\nPostgraduate\nMathematical\nAdvice Centre\nHelpLine:\next 5752\nDr Geoff Stephenson\nMathematics Dept\nArticles Deadline: Friday, 6pm Letters Deadline: Monday 6pm "

    "content": "10 Feature\nTrumpets, fanfare, we're kicking off our Cat's Tales! Forget the RSPCA, this\nisn'ta series on feline mutilation but weekly stories, the first by Rachel Basset\nAt twenty, it had of course occurred to me that\nto still be unmarried was, perhaps, a bit of a dis-grace. For many months I had lain awake, night\nafter night, ruing the fact that I was less likely to\nbe picked off the shelf than a packet of\nKellogg's Pop Tarts and was destined to be an\nunloved, childless old maid. Maybe I would\nhave slept better had I known that the book\nwhich will (I am sure) change may life was just\nround the corner...\nThe moment I saw Light His Fire by Ellen\nKriedman (subtitled How to keep you man passionately in love with you) I knew that it was\nsomething special. The warning on the first page\ntold me I'd been right.\n\"WARNING!\" it said in bold type. \"Do not\nread this book unless you are a woman that\nwants to captivate and mesmerize a man for the\nrest of his life. I REPEAT - DO NOT, UNDER\nANY CIRCUMSTANCES, read the following\nmaterial unless you want complete control over\nthe destiny of your love life!\"\nIt sounded just my kind of thing. Heaven\nknows, I 've tried to woo enough men into marrying me, with no success. The chance for 'com-ple te control' seemed too good to miss. Avidly, I read on to find that Ellen, the author, had been\nmarried happily for twenty three years and had\nbeen running courses called 'Light His Fire'\nwith thousands of satisfied couples as a result.\nGenerously, she has also shared her knowledge\nwith those of us who do not live in the US by\nwriting this book - and what knowledge! She\nobviously know her stuff, as some of her testimonials showed:\n\"Mary began to receive love letters after the\nfirst few classes. She received two offers of marriage and three dozen roses all in the same\nmonth.\n\"After she'd done just three homework\nassignments, Cindy's lover proposed marriage.\"\nI couldn't wait. I swallowed up the book\nwhole in my impatience to be down that aisle.\nFinally, having absorbed all the advice and written the important points, as recommended, on\nindex cards to be carried around with me at all\ntimes, I set forth to the ultimate test - a man.\nPete was my first target. A fellow student\nhere, he lived just two floors down and by a stroke of luck was in. He greeted me genially\nand invited me into the room, little knowing that\nthe quiet girl he once knew had been transformed into a love bomb ready for explosion.\n\"And how are things?\" he asked.\nNervously, I tried to remember my lines. I was taking the piece of Ellen's advice which\nstarted \"Notice your man. Notice his muscular\nlegs. Notice his masculine chest. Notice...\" and\ncarried on through the anatomy. I was determined to notice them all.\n\"Pete,\" I said. \"Did you know you have muscular legs, a masculine chest, a handsome face, a gorgeous head of hair, sexy eyes, a beautiful\nsmile, broad shoulders, large muscular hands\nand a deep voice?\"\n\"Why thank you Rachel,\" he replied, calmly\ncontinuing to stack his notes. \"So have you.\"\nTwenty minutes later I left the room, un-pro-posed to. Obviously I had just had the bad luck\nto choose one of life's eternal bachelors.\nThe next day, I had the good fortune to run\ninto my unattached friend Bob in the corridor.\nThis seemed an excellent opportunity to try out\nEllen's hint of calling men by pet names. She\nhad even suggested some pet names to try and I had committed some of the best to memory.\n\"Hell, Hunky Punky\" I said. What a reaction!\nBob was so pleased that his mouth dropped open\nand he went a peculiar shade of red.\n\"What?\" He was obviously unable to believe\nhis luck.\n\"Stud Muffin? Dr. Nude?\"\n\"I don't understand,\" he said. Typical of a man to play it cool.\n\"Nummy Num, Hunkey Poo. Bob, would you\nlike to marry me?\"\nThat was, I think, where I made my mistake.\nMaybe I sounded just that bit too keen for Bob\nwho hurried off - just when I'd really made an\nimpression on him! It looked as if here was a man who just needed a little more persuasion.\nOver the weekend I pondered over my cam-pa ign, Light his Fire never far from my side. I read it endlessly, trying to find that elusive plan\nwhich would get me my man.\n\"At Hallowe'en, dress up in a mask and a coat. Wear nothing underneath. Ring his front\ndoorbell when he doesn 't expect it, say 'Trick or\ntreat' and flash him.\"\nAn excellent idea. What a shame Hallowe'en\nhad been and gone.\n\"Just before you enter the restaurant or your\nWho is Don Adlington? Turn to page 7 to find out\n\n"

He\nexpressed his regret at his past\ninadequacies when dealing with\nCollege matters at a meeting of the\nUnion Executive Committee on\nMonday.\nA letter leaked to Felix last week\nconfirmed fears that Mr Wensley\nhad misled students at Imperial. An\noutline of the letter from the\nCollege Registrar, Peter Mee, was\nand Ents office above the Traditional Bar. The club was moved to\nmake way for a welfare office.\nFollowing complaints in\nprevious years, an agreement was\ndrawn up whereby the practise\nrooms were only to be used when\nthe library was open, enabling\nresidents to study there. This year's residents, however, are unhappy\nwith the situation. Dr John Finley,\nthe Warden of Beit Hall, told Felix:\n\"People renting a room want to be\nable use it. The current\narrangements haven't worked and\nthe practise rooms are being\nmoved.\"\nFurther grievances have been\nbrought up by residents of the hall.\nIt appears that after many years, the\nstairways in the hall have now had\ncarpets fitted.

In a speech given at his farewell\nreception, Mr Lloyd Davies made\nseveral satirical comments about the\nrunning of the College. These\nremarks were said to be likely to\nprinted in last week's issue of Felix.\nThe full document was presented to\nthe Executive Committee at the\nmeeting on Monday.\nThey suggested that a working\nparty be formed to meet and discuss\nthe development of the constitution,\ntaking into account the comments\ncontained within the letter.\nCharles Leary, Deputy President\n(Clubs and Societies), told Felix:\n\"Andrew feels now that he held\ninformation away from the students\nfor too long. It has to be appreciated\nthat he had a lot going on at the\ntime and was trying to be sure that\nin preference to the rooms.\nOne resident commented: \"It's been rumoured that the rooms are\ngoing to be carpeted but we're still\nnot sure when.

He is said to\nhave criticised the current link\nbetween Imperial and St Mary's. Mr Lloyd Davies offered several\npieces of advice to his successor\nand ended by expressing a hope that\nImperial's administration would\nimprove in the future.\nall information was correct before it\nwas presented to the students.\"\nThe Executive Committee\nmeeting also highlighted the need\nfor more in-house training. Mr Leary stated: \"There is a problem\nwith the current training methods.\nAll Executive members are invited\nto a course over the summer\nvacation but many are unable to\nattend.\"\nMr Wensley stressed the \"need\nfor improved training for all union\nposts\".

The American\nsoldier being 'G.I.', and present meaning 'Give'.\nFor the actual answer this needed to be taken a step further 'with a paper' referring to the\nFinancial Times, 'F.T.' so the 'present' took the\nmeaning 'GIFT' and this was the intended\nanswer.\nAnother whoops ie was on Day 10, 14 down:\n14. Tense, but sounds successful (4)\nThe common mistake here was ' TAUT'. Tense meaning taut. The actual answer was\n'PAST' since it sounds like 'passed' and hence\n'sounds successful'. 'Tense', therefore, referred\nto the past tense.\nAnother point that was hardly spotted, even\nby some of the winners, was the appearance of\nthe 12 Days of Christmas in the relevant days of\nthe crossword.

    "content": "18 Reviews\nNico - Songs They Never Play\non the Radio\nby James Young\nAnd then there was Nico, all by herself, and she\nliked it like that. Except that Nico was never by\nherself. Within you, without you, her constant\ncompanions were powder and a hypodermic; as\nclose as blood, thick as life. Once the unwanted\ningenue forced upon the Velvet Underground by\nAndy Warhol, she could sing a bit and had been\nfilmed by Fellini. Yet this book is about a career\ndownward; the period 1981-1988.\nThe time when a needle scarred junkie tottered around Europe, growing old and looking\nfor a fix. If Spinal Tap was funny and true, this\nis true and tragically sad. James Young played\non those comfort less tours with bands that\ncouldn't play, without money, even without\ngroupies.\nDespite what Tony Parsons says on the front\ncover, this book is never funny. How can it be?\nIf Paul Simon sings 'every day's an endless\nstream of cigarettes and magazines' and James\nYoung says Nico's 'was a life measured out in\nMarlboro butts' and worse, I see nothing to\nlaugh at. Their heroin intake was prestigious, as\nbefitted the 'Queen of Junkies', her diet was\nanorexic, small wonder she became a sexless\nangel of the night.\nHer company was little better. Third rate\nmusicians living off a self destructive icon. They\nplayed behind the drug less iron curtain (while\nstocks lasted), the disco bars of Italy, even the\npolite applause of the Japanese.\nGoing nowhere with a small white package;\nJohn Cale even managed to get an album out of\nher. 'Camera Obscura'. In fact Cale is the most\nsolid figure in the 288 pages. An addict who\ncleans up, loses four stone and a death wish.\nSomeone who makes it through and, as such, he\nwas a contrast to Nico. She did try; she got onto\nmeth and one, she straightened up; but fate was\ncruel. In July 1988, a regenerating Nico died\nafter falling off a motorbike in Ibiza, aged 50.\nShe was never great, she struggled for it.\nMaybe she was influential but I doubt it. Her\nrollercoaster decayed from the Factory to the\nend. It's a story worth telling; for the music,\nmediocrity, drugs, waste, morbid humour and\nsoulless ness. The safe middle classes will rejoice. Boring\nis best, Nico is your mirror.\nTintin\nPublished by: Arrow\nPrice: \u00a35.99\nDriving Force\nby Dick Francis\nDick Francis writes thrillers about horse racing.\nI can't stand horse racing.\nBut, after twelve months of reading nothing\nbut text books in preparation for exams, I could\nthink of no better reward for all that work than\nto saddle up with one of Francis's horsey who-dunn its. Driving Force is Francis's31st thriller\nand I consumed it with the same gusto as the\nother 30!\nFreddie Croft, the hero of Driving Force, is a former jockey who now runs a haulage firm specialising in transporting champion race horses\naround the world.\nA hitch-hiker, picked up by one of the horse-box drivers, despite the strict instructions to the\ncontrary, dies in the cab. In his possession is a flask, which appears to hold coffee but turns out\nto be something far more sinister. Later, Croft's mechanic accidentally discovers secret compartments underneath the horse boxes. Someone is\nusing Croft Transport as a courier to carry...well,\nit's nothing so obvious as drugs and the reader\nwon't work out what it is until Francis reveals it.\nWithout giving too much away, the plot will\nparticularly enthrall IC's scientists and even they\nwill be hard put to solve the mystery. Francis\nkeeps the reader tightly reigned from the off\nuntil the final furlong, galloping them through\nmurder and mayhem at a tumultuous pace.\nThe final scenes are rivetting and the solution\ningenious. Every muscle, sinew and nerve in my\nbody was drum-skin tight as my eyes raced\ntowards it. This Driving Force is a very powerful one indeed.\nShaun Joynson\nPublished by: Pan\nPrice: \u00a34.99\npi MMMMi\nChief of Staff\nby William Coyle\nWhen I saw that the resume on the back of the\nbook went as follows: quote \"...two people\nthrown together by the harsh climate of war. An\nAmerican man and an Australian woman, each\nseizing the last chance to live and love, while\nothers prepared to die...\", I thought, oh no! It's going to be one of those books!!\nBut, to my surprise it wasn't one of these\nsoppy stories. Set during the Second World\nWar, the book was mainly about the war in the\nPacific (it makes a change after the thousand of\nbooks about world war II in Europe). Set at the\nlevel of the Generals, it follows their ambitions\nand intrigues to get more power. The 'love\naffair' between the Chief of Staff and an\nAustralian Officer only seems to come in as a side story (thank God for that), but is well fitted\nin. The author manages to grasp your attention\nand even if this is not the book of the century, I ended up enjoying the read more than I expect-ed.\nThe Frog\nPublished by: Pan\nPrice: \u00a34.99\nl Pr; Wmii\nl Pr; Green Mars\nby Kim Stanley\nRobinson\nThis is the second book in a trilogy on the\ncolonisation of Mars.\nThe first revolution of 2061 failed and now\nmany of the first 100 settlers are dead or have\ngone into hiding, scattered in isolated groups\nacross the surface of Mars. But still the dream\ncontinues of a terraformed Mars, with vegetation and a breathable atmosphere. Slowly the\nunderground movement gathers the momentum\nneeded to overthrow the transnational companies who are fighting for dominance on Mars.\nThroughout this book, one is struck by the\nrealistic technical details of life on Mars. Unlike\nmany Science Fiction novels that hang technical\nfragments on a poor story line, Kim Stanley\nRobinson manages to do the opposite: the science has a gripping story hung on it. The characters and the plot develop over 50 years, as the\nface of Mars changes due to the effects of the\nterraforming.\nThis book and probably the whole series is\nan absolute must for anybody.\nBlodwin\nPublished by: Harper Collins\nPrice: \u00a314.99 (Hardback)\nFor a review of monologue by a man in an anorak - see page 16\n\n"

    "content": "16 Reviews\nMerry Wives Anorak of Fire\nNorthern Broadside presents Shakespeare's Merry Wives. Good acting, few props and horrible costumes were the most eminent features:\nmost of the men were dressed in such a creepy\nway it was impossible to admire any one of\nthem.\nIshia Bennison played Mistress Quickly and\nwas hilariously convincing. Elizabeth Estensen\nas Mistress Ford did very well as a turtledove\nand certainly outdid Minnie Mouse - I could\nalmost see small flashy hearts rising in the air.\nMistress Page, portrayed by Polly Hemmingway, is a Shakespearean feminist who knows\nhow to deal with the world, including a lecherous braggart, by the name of Sir John Falstaff.\nThis part was brilliantly played by Barrie Rutter\nwith the help of a big pillow amongst other\npadding.\nOne of the most hilarious scenes was when\nmost of the characters had to pretend to be\nfairies, wearing tutus and veils combined with\nwell ies! A splendid and worthwhile show.\nKristine\nLyric Hammersmith, King Street, W6.081 741\n2311. Tube: Hammersmith. Mon-Sat 7.45pm. Tickets from \u00a37.50. Ends Jan 22.\nA one man show about the trials and tribulations\nof a trains potter doesn't, on the face of it, sound\nlike a bundle of laughs. The antics of anorak\nwearers are intrinsically boring and pathetic (go\nand talk to a physicist if you don't believe me),\nbut not actually all that funny; they're too easy\na target. So, despite all the plaudits, this play had\nreceived during its run at this year's Edinburgh\nFestival, I doubted it was possible to fill an hour\nwith trains potter jokes. (What else can you do\nwith trains potters except tell jokes about them?)\nWas I right? Well...yes and no. This isn't, as\nsome critics would have you believe, a laugh-a minute show; there simply isn't enough material\nfor that, and some of the gags are worn and\nover-used. Gentle amusement was a more common response than uncontrollable laughter, but\nit would be wrong to think of everything apart\nfrom the punchlines as just padding; we really\nare allowed a glimpse into a hobby that appears\nto most outsiders as strange and obsessive - we\neven emp a this e with our guide to the world of\ntrain spotting, Gus Gascoigne.\nIn a show like this, everything rests on the\nactor's performance, and James Holmes convincingly portrays Gus as a very real person,\nwith human frailties and desires. This ensures\nthat when Gus regales us with the joys of\nnight spotting, or shares with us the story of his\none, fleeting brush with the opposite sex (a brilliant sequence this, suffering only slightly from\nan over-obvious punchline), we laugh with him\nrather than at him. Gus's secret hopes and fears\nare, in essence if not in detail, very easy for us to\nunderstand and the play is all the more touching\nand poignant because of the very personal nature\nof the performance.\nThe monologue does have its down-side\nthough, and its difficult to sustain the interest of\nthe audience when all they have to hold on to is\na single, lone voice. Even an hour is too long;\nthe effect eventually becomes wearying, almost\nclaustrophobic. Despite these problems, Anorak\nis worth seeing, just don't expect a brilliantly\nfunny show - you may be disappointed.\nJoe\nArts Theatre, Great Newport St, WC2. 071 836\n2132.

    "content": "Feature\nChow Guide\nThe Chicago Pizza Pie\nFactory\nHanover Square is more notorious for Caspers\nWine Bar, where people sit at tables with individual telephones and everyone rings everyone\nelse up. However, if verbal intercourse is not a strength, judge the pizzas on offer at a neighbouring joint - Chicago Pizza Pie Factory.\nSituated in a basement, the first thing that is\nnoticed are the calling cards of previous visitors\ndisplayed on the staircase on the way down.\nDon't hesitate in adding yours to the collection.\nThe decor is obtrusively American, with no\nnatural lighting and white walls. Decorations are\nthe run-of-the-mill '50s posters advertising\nyoung damsels with pure white teeth. The pipes\non the ceiling have not been covered and are\nclearly visible in their garish red. But once this\nis combined with the music playing, it all fits\ninto place.\nAlso, do not forget why you came here. I say\nskip the starter and set your mind and taste buds\nto the forthcoming pizza. There are other choices for the main course, but you would be wasting a visit if you choose them.\nThe pizza arrives and remember your previous finest pizza, because those sentiments will\nsoon be forgotten. The base is portentously soft\nand smooth, more so than any former pizza\nexperience. The tomato sauce combines wonderfully and there is not an excess of toppings to\nhide the sensuality of the crust.\nOnce you have demolished your pizza I see\nno need to pillage your palate with a dessert.\nStill, if the occasion requires it, the Chocolate\nExtravaganza is sufficient for two and the\nCheesecake ranks amongst the best.\nAgain, there is a cocktail bar in the rest au rant, near the entrance, with its own seating area\nand TVs showing American football or MTV.\nDrinks ordered come from there, but to take\nadvantage of the Happy Hour you must sit at the\nbar and not at your table.\nThis place does get busy, so a reservation\nalways helps. The service is fast and sociable,\nchiefly because the waitresses are American.\nThey will happily help you celebrate birthdays,\nbringing out cakes and join in with the singing.\nI have no doubts in announcing the Chicago\nPizza Pie Factory as producing the best pizza in\nLondon, and giving it an award of 9 for the\npizza, but 8 overall due to limited menu.\n(Nainish clearly paid by credit card and forgot to scrawl the prices on a serviette or nick\nthe menu. You're looking at about \u00a38 a meal.\nOh, and the pizzas are second best to my own\ndemon, the Wandsworth Waster - Features Ed)\n17 Hanover Square, Wl\nTel: 071 629 2669\nTube: Oxford Circus\nHours: Mon-Sat (11.45am11.30 pm) Sun (12pm10.30 pm) Luigi Malone's One of many locals to eat at in South\nKensington, Luigi's is the most attractively\npriced, with a menu that spans all continents in\nits variety.\nIt is small and popular, especially with yup-pies, but there is no discrimination against stu-dents. However, that does ensure it gets busy,\nespecially with a cocktail bar.\nLuigi Malone's is small, and this is emphasised as you enter. Immediately you notice the\nnarrowness, especially as the bar is right at the\nmain door and you are normally required to\nwade through a dozen portable phones with their\nowners.\nThe menu is a surprise, though. A plentiful\nchoice is offered, with eight starters which\nshould be by-passed for reasons which are\nupcoming. If you do want to have a full meal,\ntry the Malone's Mushrooms (\u00a32.85), or the\nimaginative Deep Fried Brie with Cherry\n(\u00a32.95).\nBut now to the main course. There is the\nchoice of hamburgers (\u00a34.95 to \u00a35.25), pizzas\n(\u00a34.65 to \u00a35.95), hot sandwiches (\u00a35.25), pasta\n(\u00a34.50 to \u00a35.25), salads (\u00a34.55 to \u00a35.95), steaks\n(\u00a39.95 to \u00a310.95), fa j it as( \u00a38.25) and more!\nDisappointingly, there is a slant towards\nAmerican food.\nNow, not only is the choice liberal, but the\nportions are even astoundingly copious. Be prepared to share a pizza (classically thin), or forgo\nyour next meal.\nIda ren't recommend a dish because they are\nall good, but pizzas are always preferred, mainly\nfor the price! I must say that I have never known\nLuigi's to disappoint me.\nMoving on to the desserts. I doubt patrons are\nassumed to have a dessert, but if they do, all\ncosting \u00a32.45 apart from the Potted Stilton\n(\u00a32.95). The Chocolate Ripple Cheesecake causes waves on the tongue, but I was not sufficiently impressed with the Tiramisu.\nThere is a large selection of international\nbeers (\u00a31.85 to \u00a32.65), further emphasising the\nmulti-cultural menu. A wide selection of cocktails (\u00a32.95; \u00a32.25 during Happy Hour) are\ngiven, but ask for your own to be made if it isn't offered. Soft drinks weigh in at \u00a31.10.\nLunchtime queues are very rare. At\nlunchtimes a free drink is offered with any meal.\nFriday and Saturday evenings are murder, otherwise there is rarely a requirement to wait.\nLuigi's is a place that you can go happily\nenough for lunch or dinner, it is close to college,\nand the service is efficient, fast and friendly. Be\nwarned that the place is small, and even stretching your legs must be done with caution, unless\nyou desire to harm someone.\nI give Luigi Malone's an 8.\n73 Old Brompton Road, SW7\nTel: 071 584 4323\nTube: South Kensington\nIdeas for places to review?

For, despite the quirky and,\nlet's face it, downright obscure origins of the\nband members, this is a tedious pop-rock\nalbum. In fact, they use every trick in the book:\nthe choruses go \"nah-nah-nah-nah\" and every\nsong has a guitar solo. One or two veer a bit\nmore in the direction of hardcore, but the feeling is that this MUST be a joke.

A time when the members of\nImperial will break away from the drudgery of\nthe eating establishments within the College\ncampus, safe in the knowledge that their\npalates can be satisfied elsewhere.\nMuch fuss is made about the delights of\nLondon's theatres, museums and other historical monuments, but the wide range of cuisines\navailable is often looked over.\nYes, the food world's answer to Film '94\nis here. Here in the consecrated pages of Felix\nsuggestions will be given, free and without\nthe need for a TV licence, for places to go and\nspend your hoarded few precious pounds on\ngrub.\nThere will be a mixture of places reviewed\nand all desires, afflictions (including veggies)\nand wallets will be catered for. Everywhere\nwill be within walking distance or else accessible by tube.\nThe reviews will consist of selected dishes\nand drinks, with prices. Personal favourites\nmight be given and an overall average meal\nprice will be included. There will be the all-important, but occasionally misleading, mark\nout of 10, based on choice and quality of food,\natmosphere, service, decor, value for money\nand personal perception.\nIf anyone has any ideas for restaurants to\nreview please drop a line to the Felix Office,\nand you can even give it a go yourself.\nHere's looking forward to a stomach\nag grand ising year.\nNainish Bapna\nThe FELiX Superior\nKhan's For an experience which you will repeatedly\nwish to relive, Khan's is the place. Okay, the\nfood is not the best. Yes, the service leaves room\nfor improvement. Yes, the owner's name is Mr\nKhan. And don't come hoping for a quiet meal,\nor nouvelle cuisine. But it's cheap. And yes,\neveryone loves it.\nIt's easy to see why once you go there. The\nfood is not what my mother would cook, but it's not over-rich like most restaurants manage, it's not much better than the local take-away at\nhome. The menu is quite sizable, catering for\nveggies and all the meat cooked is Halal.\nThere are no starters at Khan's, but the perennial papa dom s do remain popular, especially\nwith the choice of pickles that are always on the\ntable.\nMoving onto the main course I recommend\nthe Butter Chicken (\u00a33.80), it has just the right\namount of cream in it. Avoid the Chicken Tikka\n(\u00a33.10), it's different from how it is normally\ndone. Meat-wise the Rogan Josh (\u00a32.60) as a curry or the Tandoori Boti Kebab (\u00a34.95) as a whole meal, are the best bets.\nThe th ali(ve g: \u00a35.25, non-ve g: \u00a35.50) is\nactually the best venture, giving you a range of\nfoods. Another choice giving a mixture is the\nMixed Grill with nan (\u00a34.95), for carnivores\nonly, but is a bit dry.\nFor dessert the Rasmali (\u00a31.50) and Kulfi\n(\u00a31.50) are preferred choices, with my preference towards the Kulfi, as the Rasmali's milk is\na bit thin.\nWhat gives Khan's its popularity is its atmosphere. I love it. I feel like I have been transported to a restaurant back in India. The background\nnoise level ensures that whispers will not carry,\nthe fans whirring up above, the waiters scurrying\naround shouting in a strange language and carrying an unbelievable number of utensils on their\nforearms.\nCobra Beer is served here. A beer brewed in\nIndia, but which is very rarely drunk there. Well,\nI 've never seen anybody drink it there. There are\nno cocktails to choose from and the soft drinks\ncost 90p. The waiters do speak English and ask them if\nyou don't understand anything. They are pretty\nefficient, with your food normally arriving 15 to\n20 minutes after ordering.\nKhan's is great for big groups, where you can\nmake as big a disturbance as you like. Table\nbookings are only given rarely, at the beginning\nof an evening at that, so be prepared to wait.\nRemember, not a romantic night out.\nThe location is handy to those at St Mary's( it\nis in Bayswater). Otherwise, those of you on the\nSouth Kensington campus can always stroll\nacross the park.\nOverall I award Khan's an 8.\n13-15 Westbourne Grove, W2\nTel: 071 727 5420\nTube: Bayswater, Queensway or Royal Oak\nHours: Daily (12pm3 pm,6 pm to 12am) Wong KeVs\nLocated in Chinatown, this is one of the most\nfamous Chinese restaurants. Their notoriety is\nbased on the quality of the service, which really\nmust be encountered to be believed. The waiters\nspecialise in supplying the minimum amount of\nservice possible. Their English is sketchy, so\ntaking a Cantonese speaker with you might\nprove of assistance.\nThe food itself is cheap, but not a gastronomical delight. You can escape with a bill of\nless than \u00a33 if you settle for a combination dish\n(\u00a32.40 to \u00a33.50). A combination dish is rice or\nnoodles with meat or vegetables. I 've never had\nthe same dish twice.\nOf course, you may care to eat properly. To\ntake a main course and rice, boiled (90p) or fried\n(\u00a31.10) separately. The choice of dishes is very\nwide, with seafood, duck, pork, all the favourites\nand cheap for what you get. But be warned, the\nchoice for vegetarians is very limited.\nStrangely, the waiters never allow non-Orientals to have con gee, a rice soup and meat\ndish unless you particularly insist on it. I tried it\nelsewhere and I found nothing sinister.\nI find though that the food is slightly oily.\nEven ostr aci sing this misdeed, this place is not a locale to take your diet to. Very few people need\nmore than a combination dish to sustain them\nuntil their next meal.\nChinese tea is supplied, unless you ask not to\nhave it. There is a small charge added on at the\nend, which I assume is for the tea, but as the bill\nis written in Cantonese (I think) I cannot be too\nsure. There is the normal choice of soft drinks\n(\u00a31.00) and there are some wines, but I have\nseen people take their own drinks in.\nThe service, speed-wise, is good, only normally having to wait for about ten minutes, but\ndon't forget the irascibility of the waiters.\nIf you ask nicely you can forgo the joys of\nusing chopsticks for the luxury of a fork.\nThe queue is normally non-existent, as the\nrestaurant spans at least four floors and you are\nnever given much chance to loiter after finishing\nyour food, with your bill deposited on your table\nbefore they even start clearing up.\nWong Kei's is a place that has to be visited,\njust for the experience of seeing these businessmen (who else would wear suits?) sitting in this\ncheap restaurant and being vilified by the wait-ers. However, once you've experienced it, go to\nthe other restaurants in Chinatown, the food and\nservice are better.\nWong Kei gets 7 for the first time visit experience, after that only 5.\n41-43 Wardour Street, Wl\nTel: 071 437 6833\nTube: Piccadily Circus\nHours: Daily (12pm11.30 pm) Look out for more restaurant reviews in future issues\n\n"

Strange really, we're all grown, sane\nadults here, concentrating on carbon daubed\npaper. It's like someone has died. Modigliani\ndid die of course, and in the best possible taste,\ntoo. By1920 the great lover of 1884 was\nwrecked with tuberculosis and he did other\nthings which did him no good: opium, alcohol\nand hashish. His only lifetime exhibition was\nclosed down for indecency in 1917 and it didn't sell anything anyway. The man had little going\nfor him. Even today his characteristic elongated,\nstylised faces are only regarded as second rate.\nIf Modigliani could have attended his exhibition himself, a scene springs to my mind In\nstrides the drunken artist, joint in hand and disreputable girlfriend struggling in behind on\ntwelve inch white stilettoes. There is a gasp\nfrom the assembled serious art journalists as\nModig. clatters across to Brian Sewell, promptly\nthrows on the famous critic's shoes and then\nlaugh es long and loud, ha a aha a aha a a. The point\nis he was not a serious artist in the way we\nanalyse him to be and we lose something by\nthat.\nThe exhibition itself is over long, consisting\nof 240 sketches but, alas, only one oil and one\nsculpture. The sketches themselves are there for\nthe delights of Modigliani PhD scholars but for\ndull. I suppose the historical point of the work is\nthe developing maturing of his style and there is\nsome of this on show. A linkage to primitive art,\nespecially African and Cambodian, is one exam-ple. Of more artistic interest is a room dedicated\nto Caryatids, which are sculptural figures used\nas columns. Here, at last, full bodies with a certain grace can be seen, over and above the two-view mug shots which predominate elsewhere.\nThe exhibition was all collected by Dr Paul\nAlexandre, who was Modigliani's patron during\nthe period 1906-1914. He saved most of the\nsketches from the bin, as Modigliani generally\nthrew away everything he didn't consider good\nenough. And the question remains, assuming\nthat Alexandre did the world a service, have the\nRoyal Academy done us a service putting on an\nexhibition so heavily angled towards the his tori an?\nTintin\np.s.I think Brian Sewell is an astute art critic,\nwhatever that means.

    "content": "Reviews 17\nAnother Menace II\nStakeout Society\nStarring: Richard Dreyfuss, Emilio Estevez\nDirector: John Badham\nStakeout was a storming film and the sequel will\nnot disappoint. All too often sequels are made\njust for financial reasons, but a great deal of\ntime and thought has gone into this film. It is\nrefreshingly different from the last, but still with\nthe same style and humour.\nThis time detectives Leece and Rymers\n(Dreyfuss and Estevez) are teamed up with\nassistant attorney Gina Garrett (Rosie\nO 'Donnell). They pass themselves off as father,\nmother and son to stake out a possible hiding\nplace for a trial witness who's on the run.\nLeece's love interest from the first film features again, though like all really great sequels\nthis quite happily stands on its own with no\nviewing of the original necessary. However, I guarantee that after seeing this you'll want to\nsee the original, if not for the first time, then to\nremind yourself how good it was.\nThe only down point is that perhaps this\nsequel has too much humour and not enough\ndrama; I think it was this fine balance that made\nthe original so repeatedly palatable.\nSphen\nStarring: Larenz Tate, Tyrin Turner\nDirectors: Albert and Alan Hughes\nFirst off, let's be clear that it gives me no pleasure to tell you that Menace II Society is not\nvery good. Life in the LA ghettoes, the pressure\non young men to join gangs and the tragic consequences of doing so, has made rivetting viewing in films like Boyz 'n' The Hood and New\nJack City.\nMenace had the opportunity to make its point\nmore realistically and powerfully than ever. Yet\nreviews have been lukewarm at best, and the US\nbox office takings confirm how average the film\nis. The most cursory comparison with Boyz V the Hood, which caused riots in cinemas and\ngained an Oscar nomination for its 23 year old\nfirst-time director, shows the sheer lack of\npower in this effort.\nThe problem lies with the Hughes brothers'\ndirection, which suffers from a severe lack of\nexperience. Not of film-making, because some\nof the most moving films are first efforts, but of\ntheir subject. If I was a cynic, I might assume\nthat the boys pitched a more violent version of\nBoyz to a gullible studio who, in true Hollywood\nfashion, were eager to cash in on this new genre.\nO Doggonit - not another gangsta movie\nThey singularly failed to notice the brothers\nwere from the middle-class suburbs of Detroit,\nand that directing a few rap videos was about as\nclose as they had come to the ghetto.\nThis helps to explain why the story of O Dog\nand his violent surroundings seems so hollow\nand ultimately un fulfilling. Tony Grew\nStranger Than\nParadise\nStarring: John Lurie, Ezter Balint, Richard Edson\nDirector: Jim Jarmusch\n'Paradise never found' would aptly describe the\nfate befalling this trio of drifters in this film.\nWillie (Lurie) is an Americanised Hungarian\nwho has lived in New York for ten years. When\nhis sixteen year-old cousin, Eva (Balint), arrives\nto begin a new life in America, he's compelled\nto re-establish links with his estranged family.\nEva stays with Willie before travelling to\nCleveland to stay with their aunt.\nOne year later, Willie and his best friend\nEddie (Edson) are caught cheating at poker and\nare forced to make a rapid exit. They head for\nCleveland, to 'kidnap' Eva from her dead-end\nlife. The trio reach Florida where a bizarre\nsequence of trag i comic events lead to an ironic\nand suitably pathetic conclusion in which the\ngroup becomes finally separated.\nThe film is shot in short, black and white and\neach scene is acutely succinct and unadorned.\nA Postcard from Paradise: Weather was here, wish you were beautiful\nThe dialogue is crisp and carefully chosen,\nwhilst effective use of music enables poignant\nmoments to be highlighted. Overall, the story is\ntold simply and evocative ly. The plot is somewhat unconvincing, but the film's elementary\nnature sharply accentuates the moments of\nhumour and pathos.\nThe end is apt - Willie and Eva epi to mise the\nmany immigrants who entered the New World\nfull of hope, but for whom the American Dream\nwas never fulfilled.\nCoffee and Cigarettes\nThis short film showing with Stranger Than\nParadise is one of five by Jarmusch. Iggy Pop\nand Tom Waits meet in a gro tty cafe and discuss\nsubjects including roadside surgery, coffee and\ncigarettes. The stilted dialogue is occasionally\namusing and the acting well rehearsed, but the\nfilm lacked purpose and I was left asking: \"Well,\nwhat's the point?\"\nDavid Montagu.\nNext Week: Reviews of Heaven and Earth and Mrs Doubtfire\n\n"

    "content": "22 Opinion\nEditorial\nThe attitude of students towards the affairs of\nImperial College Union have changed quite\ndramatically in recent times. Last year, I was\ntalking to a President of ICU from about seven\nyears ago and he was telling me about how it\nused to be. People were interested and\nconcerned about what went on; Union General\nMeetings (UGMs) were packed full of people\nwanting to put forward their opinions; people\nwanted to change things.\nClubs and societies would operate devious\ntactics to ensure that they got their own way.\nThey would get all their members to turn up to\nthe UGMs and when a motion came up that they\nobjected to and didn't want passed, they would\nall get up and walk out. The meeting would\nbecome in quo rate and the last person to leave\nthe room would shout 'Quorum'. That would be\nthe end of the meeting and the end of the motion\nuntil the next U GM when the same thing would\nprobably happen again.\nI don't think that the issues of today are any\nless important or affect the student body any less\nthan ten years ago. Maybe people no longer\nhave a desire to change anything or maybe they\nthink that expressing their opinion won't make a difference in the grand scheme of things or\nmaybe they just don't know what's going on\nwithin that great institution that is Imperial\nCollege Union.\nThe Union isn't exactly going out of its way\nto promote any interest in itself or improve its\nimage among the students. We've got a President who's been misleading the students\nand he's the one who's supposed to be the\nultimate representative of the students and their\nviews. Who knows what else he may or may not\nhave done?!\nGranted, he has been working with the U GM Chair to publicise details of the UGMs, but there\nare elections coming up for all sorts of posts\nwithin the Union and no-one's got a clue about\nthem. What good is it if you've got people\ninterested in what is going on in the Union but\nno-one to actually run the place.\nHow many of you know that the sabbatical\nelections are taking place this term? I guess\nthose of you here last year will. Marcus, in his\nletter on the opposite page, talked about student\napathy amongst Imperial's students. Never is it\nmore obvious than during the sabbatical\nelections. A campus wide ballot is taken and last\nyear and the grand total of 23% of the students\nvoted. Maybe, like I said before, people just\ndon't know what's going on. But when you are\nelecting the people to represent you and your\nviews for the following year, maybe you ought\nto be told about it.\nSecurity\nPeople have apparently were running around the\nPhysics department yesterday brandishing water\npistols. Now, College Security aren't too happy\nabout this because in the past police have\narrested people after mistaking the water pistols\nfor real guns. So, they've asked me to ask all of\nyou not to hold your water fights within the\nCollege premises.\nThe Valentine Special Edition of Felix will be coming out\non 11th February.\nYou can send a message to the love (or hate) of your life y rae| of charge through Felix.Just make sure they are put into the\nValentine pigeonhole in the Felix Office by 4th February.\nJazz History In\nThe Making?\nDear Beccy,\nThursday the 13th saw an event which will\nlive long in jazz history; well at least as long as\nit takes to get this published anyway.\nIC now has a thirty piece jazz orchestra with\na library of roughly forty tunes. We're a totally\nnon-serious band although, if students and staff\nlearn something from playing jazz together now\nthat the opportunity is there, then so much the\nbetter.\nWe're finding a rehearsal venue so close to\nthe union bar very educational.

(Photo by Malcolm Crowthers.)\nIn 1969 the young composer John Tavener was\nintroduced to Apple Records by John Lennon.\nThe following year, the company kick-started\nTavener's discography with their recording of\nThe Whale, which soon achieved cult status. Rereleased by EMI in 1992, it has just been deleted\nfrom the catalogue; evidently even cult status is\nnot enough to sell a32 minute CD. A dramatic\ncantata based on the story of Jonah, The Whale\nis a melting-pot of influences from jazz to\nWebern. There's also a blatant crib from\nBritten's War Requiem and a brief contribution\nfrom Ringo Starr (plus megaphone). The Celtic\nRequiem, recorded as a follow-up to The Whale\nand also recently deleted, displays more co he sion, as well as a black sense of humour in its\noverlaying of the Latin text with nursery rhymes\n(e.g. 'Mary had a little lamb' in the 'Agnus dei').\nThe best reasons for seeking out this disc are the\nstrange and haunting B side items, Nomine Jesu\nand Coplas.\nTavener now distances himself from much of\nhis early output, feeling it to be unrepresentative\nof his mature style of composition. Since his\nconversion to the Russian Orthodox Church in\n1977, his music has increasingly been inspired\nby the liturgy and doctrine of Eastern\nOrthodoxy. He often describes his later works as\nikons - contemplative objects designed to focus\nattention on particular aspects of the faith - and\ntheir repetitive, episodic nature is more suited to\nthe church than the recording studio. It's simplistic but illuminating to describe a typical passage of contemporary Tavener as being like a bright skein of melody unravelling across the\ndeep pile carpet of the is on, or Byzantine drone.\nThis style is easily approached through\nTavener's unaccompanied choral settings, of\nwhich several fine examples, including the\nMagnificat and The Tiger, are to be found on\nHyperion's 'Sacred Music of John Tavener'.\nEven more rewarding is the fragile splendour of\nthe Ikon of Light for choir and string trio,\nsuperbly sung by the Tallis Scholars on Gimell,\nand also offered by The Sixteen on their new\nand better-coupled Collins Classics release.\nAnother good starting point on all three of these\ndiscs is the beautiful setting of William Blake's The Lamb, which is also available from Conifer\non their generously-filled mixed collection ' A Boy Was Born'. And if these all sound a little\naustere, try the exhilarating dance episodes of\nThe Repentant Thief, played by clarinettist\nAndrew Marriner and the LSO on a Collins\nClassics CD single.\nTavener's larger-scale works progress not\nthrough the expected technique of thematic\ndevelopment, but by repetition and varied sc or ing. Tavener would say that such a technique is\nretrograde only in the narrow context of the\nWestern musical tradition that has led from Bach\nto Berg and beyond. He prefers to see himself as\napart of a wider milieu encompassing Eastern\nmusical influences. These are manifest in an\noccasional insistence on the augmented second\n(sometimes sounding kitschy and pseudo-Oriental) and, more subtly, in a flexibility of\npitch that recalls the pungent keening of the\nmuezzin. Which brings us to the peak of\nTavener's recorded o eu vre, Virgin Classics' The\nProtecting Veil for cello and string orchestra.\nTry the beginning of track two, soloist Steven\nIsserlis threading a melody sweet and malleable\nas melted toffee through the hushed nocturnal\nglissandi of accompanying strings; do listen to\nit, it'sachin gly beautiful.\nThe Protecting Veil enjoyed well-deserved\nchart success a couple of years ago, and Tavener\nwas unable to resist quoting its aspiring cello\ntheme at the climax of his vast choral ikon We\nShall See Him As He Is, available from Chandos,\nconducted by Richard Hickox. The concept of\nmusic as ikon is taken further in the opera Mary\nof Egypt, written for the Aldeburgh Festival and\nenterprising ly recorded by Collins at its premiere\nthere in 1992. Stripped of all but the barest minimum of action, the work consists of a series of\nstatic stage-pictures, or living ikons, relating the\nprogress of the central character from prostitution to redemption via self-denial in the desert.\nSuch a brief summary may smack of arid\nSunday school dogma, although the music is\nsometimes startlingly original and vivid.\nWithout the visual element, the material seems\nthinly stretched by the opera's two hour dura-tion, but sample the blissful first ten minutes of\nAct III for a glimpse of Tavener at his best.\n'Ikons', the BBC's weekend festival of the music\nof John Tavener, begins tonight with the\nAkathist of Thanksgiving at 7.30pm in\nWestminster Abbey and continues at the\nBarbican and Westminster Cathedral.

The company made an\ninformal application to Imperial\nCollege for permission to place a memorial on College land. They\nwere then asked to make a formal\napproach to the College Estates\nManager, Ian Caldwell (Felix 982).\nIt is felt by some that a statue\nmay be inappropriate and an\nalternative suggestion is that the\nmemorial may take the form of a plaque instead.\nFears have been expressed that,\nsince no grave exists (Freddie was\ncremated), fans will turn the\nmemorial into a shrine. Since the\nanniversary of Freddie's death is\nduring the Autumn term, the fans\nwishing to pay their respects may\ncause disruption to College life;\nthere could be as many as a thousand people.

    "content": "Feature 1\nWho You Gonna Call?\nTo Don Adlington, counselling is more about coffee than cookies on couch e If you have the label 'Student Counsellor' hanging round your neck you tend to get some funny\nreactions - \"Oh, you deal with grants and\nthings\" or \"Does anybody come to see you?\".\nWell, what does a counsellor do and why might\na University feel that it makes economic sense to\npay someone who doesn't teach, research, cook,\nclean, type, compute, manage, or do any of the\nother demonstrably productive things that go on\nin an educational institution?\nMy job, quite simply, is talking to students\nwho are experiencing worry or difficulty, affecting their studies or other aspects of their lives at\nCollege. In some ways it is a bit of a paradox\nthat counselling should be provided for students\nwho are, in many ways, the most competent and\nable segment of their age group. There aren't counsellors for bricklayers, bus-drivers, shop-workers, engineers, secretaries or bank clerks,\nall of whom are exposed to the normal hazards\nof life - so what is so special about students?\nThe answer lies in the job that the student is\ndoing. Sustained and intensive learning, mem or ising, concentrating are cognitive activities\nwhich are impaired - sometimes severely - by\nanxiety, distress and grief. This non-mix of cognitive functioning and emotional upset is not\npathological, it is a normal reaction. But for the\nuniversity student, especially perhaps, at a college like this where the work is cumulative and\nsequential, it can quickly lead to trouble and\ntherefore needs to be recognised and dealt with\nproperly.\nOf course, all sensible people expect to have\na few ups and downs in life, so how would I know if I had a 'problem' in this context? My\nown view is that we should expect to have a certain sense of well-being in the groove. Feeling\nmore than temporarily anxious and weepy, finding concentration difficult, feeling socially iso-late d, feeling profoundly doubtful about the\nSome problems, of\ncourse, are peculiar to\nstudents...\nrightness of one's choice of subject, course or\ncollege, are all indications that you should talk\nthings through with someone. Students often\nhave a very strong resistance to the idea of talking to professional helpers - or indeed to openly\nacknowledging that there is anything wrong at\nall. The assumption by family, schools and\nfriends that becoming a student is an automatic\npassport to happiness and success is sometimes a factor here, but personal pride and fear of being\nidentified as failing in some way also affects\nadaptive and straightforward ways of looking at\nproblems when they arise.\nMany problems encountered by students are\nthose to which all human beings are exposed.\nSome of them are what a psychologist would\ndescribe as maturation al problems - to do with\nthe individual's social and emotional develop-ment. The first years at University happen to\ncoincide pretty closely to the final shift into\nadulthood in which one's perception of oneself\nand one's capacities for relating to others\nbecome crystallised to a large extent. Many people move through these transitions painlessly,\nothers have some difficulty and this tends to\nemerge fairly traumatic ally as students leave the\nfamily setting for the first time and are thrown\nonto their own resources. Students having this\nsort of difficulty sometimes feel out of step with\ntheir fellow students and are convinced that\neveryone else is more socially skilled, more gre-ga riou s, more successful in finding\ngirlfriends/boyfriends and somehow more\n'valid'.\nSimilarly grief, or loss experiences are common human hazards, but with special connotations for University students. Bereave-ment or\nbroken love affairs are well understood to be\ndeeply painful and disturbing events. It is not\nquite so clearly understood that the anxiety\nengendered by parental marital problems, or by\nthe early indications that a girlfriend/boyfriend\nrelationship may be disintegrating, can be just as\ncorrosive of a person's emotional security, and\nare a major source of trouble for students.\nSome problems, of course, are peculiar to\nstudents. It is very easy for clever and intellectually talented people to become a little too closely\nidentified with academic point-scoring for its\nown sake, so that a person may come to see his\nown wholeness or validity solely in terms of\nbeing academically clever. This distortion of\npersonal development can easily give rise to\ndepressive feelings if, on coming to University,\nthe student discovers that he or she is not at the\ntop, or falls short of meeting some ideal standards which have somehow become built into\nthe person's expectations. This gives rise to what\nI call an inappropriate imperative and can be a course of real unhappiness.\nWhen things go wrong there are many people\nyou could talk to - parents, friends obviously,\nbut also personal tutors and senior tutors, wardens and sub-wardens. There are also other people in College on whom students can make\ndemands - for example Health Centre Staff - the\ndoctors and nurses. The Student Adviser in the\nStudents Union, is an expert at helping students\nwith special financial problems, with Home\nOffice queries, with landlord problems, with\nstate benefit queries and many other things. Or\nyou could come to see me. I work normal office\nhours - you can just call round or you can ring\nme. I can nearly always see people very quickly,\nusually on the same day, and talking to me is\ntotally confidential. My office is at 15 Princes\nGardens (the same house as the Accommodation\nOffice) and next door to the Health Centre, and\nmy telephone extension is 3041.\nYou can call the Student Counsellor on internal ext 3041\n\n"
