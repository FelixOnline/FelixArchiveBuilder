Last years winner\nwas Damien Hirst with his famous\ncow in formaldehyde and I was\ncurious to see what this years\nentrants could offer. So with the\naim of delaying my biochemistry\nwork for as long as possible, I set\noff for the Tate with my friend Lizzy\nin tow. This year the shortlisted\ncandidates are all women which\nhas brought a few accusations of\novert political correctness on the\njudges' behalf after last years all\nmale shortlist brought accusations\nof sexism. It seems as if they can't win either way. The first exhibition\nwas that of Christine Borland\nwhose \"exploration of language of\nforensic science and themes of\nmortality, explore the ways in\nwhich institutions exploit and\ndevalue life\"...mmm. Her exhibits\nincluded two skeletal images\nreflected onto the wall after being\ndrawn in glittery dust on panes of\nglass. (I could even identify the\nfemur!) One of the skeletons was\nvery small and the other very tall,\nthe exhibit inspired by a book of\nfairy tales. The book is on display\ntoo so even the non-arty types like\nmyself can pretend we know what\nit is all about.\nSasha and Mum was a black\nand white\nvideo piece by\nGillian Wearing, the\nsecond of the\nfour shortlisted can di dates. It\nseemed to\nconsist of a grown woman\nthrashing about in her\nunderwear whilst making\nlots of weird\ngrunting noises and pulling\na blanket over\nher head with\nanother older\nwoman next\nto her (presume ably the mum) hugging her then pulling her hair about\nand pushing her to the floor. I won't pretend to know what all this\nwas about but as the most disturbing exhibit, it will probably win.\nCornelia Parker had numerous\nsmaller exhibits on show including\n\"Wedding ring drawing\" which was\nin fact a series of diamond\nscratched lines on the outside of a glass display case. I was on the\nverge of complaining about the\ndust in the\ndisplay case\nwhen I realised that\nthe two furry\nballs of fluff\nwere part of\nthe exhibition\nentitled \"The\nNegative of\nSound\". They\nwere earplugs\nmade from\ndust collected\nat the\nWhispering Gallery of St\nPau Is Cathedral. Inhaled Cliffs\nlooked suspiciously like a folded sheet but 1 was assured that\nthe sheet had been starched with\nchalk from the white cliffs of Dover\nwhich defined it as artwork.\nLeading into the next room we\nwere greeted by the sight of a Clockwise from top left: Angela\nBulloch, Christine Borland, Cornelia\nParker, Gillian Wearing,\nrather comfy looking, brightly\ncoloured beanbag/sofa object\nwhich you could actually sit down\non. The piece called \"Untitled\"\n(seems like she wasn't too sure\nwhat it was either) was by Angela\nBulloch and was described as a superstructure with satellites.\nElectrical impulses triggered by\npeople sitting on the flat cushions\nproduced sounds around the\nroom. Her \"Blip Drawing Machine\"\ndrew a series of lines as you\nwatched, producing an image that\nlooked uncannily like an ECG,\nalthough we decided that the\npatient would almost certainly be\ndead after two blip less lines were\ndrawn.\nThe Turner Exhibition is open\nevery day at the Tate Gallery until\n18 January. The winner will be\ndecided on 2 December when you\ncan catch live coverage of the exhibition on C4. You can also check\nout the exhibition details on the\nweb at www.channel4. com. Entry\nto the Tate is free but this special\nexhibition costs \u00a33.50. Love it or\nhate it, it is definitely worth making\nthe effort to see. Decide for yourself where modern British art\nstands at the moment.\nClare Ashwin\nLONG LONG AGO\nll an Reichel\n1\n1 \\ M/n ere do we come\n\\ i\\l from?\", \"Why are we\nV V here?\" - questions\nwhich have intrigued and baffled\nthe human race since the beginning\nof time. For several years director\nll an Reichel has been fascinated by\nthe idea of exploring the human\nperception of the creation of the\nworld and its connection with\nhuman creativity. Reichel began by\nresearching countless creation\nmyths and stories from throughout\nthe world, struck by the challenge\nof lifting these legends off the page\nand bringing them to life as a piece\nof theatre. A little over two months\nago, Reichel, along with a cast\ndrawn from the Court Theatre\nTraining Company, began the\nprocess of discussions, workshops\nand improvisations which culminated in the production of \"Long,\nLong, Long Ago \"\nOn entering the small, cosy\ntheatre, with its simple, bare acting\nspace, devoid of set but for the\nwide steps rising to the backdrop,\nthere is an immediate sense of\nexpectation, of wonders about to\ncome to pass. At the sound of a gong we are plunged into darkness,\nand the stage is suddenly peopled\nby barely visible watchers and lis-ten ers. Only one man speaks,\nholding aloft a single torch, of the\ncreation of the Sun, the Earth and\nthe Solar System.\nThen follows a presentation of\nthe Polynesian creation chant,\nKumolipo, which describes the\ntransformation of the earth from a dark world of water and silence\ninto one teeming with life of all\nkinds. This involves the entire cast\nchanting in unison, and bringing to\nthe chant the most wonderful\nphysical portrayals of creation and\nbirth. During descriptions of the\nforming of the creatures in the\n\"pregnant night\" a mass of inert\nbodies becomes a crawling,\nwrithing tumult of emergent life,\nwhen the cast move almost as one\nsingle entity.\nThe dreaming people, a Malaysian story, begins with a universe inhabited only by two wise\nbeings, at the time when the sun is\ncreated by the giant dung beetle,\n(this very cleverly played by three\nactors assuming some of the\nstrangest postion s.) The woman,\nperhaps more a goddess, dreams\nof the birth of a son, and begs her\nhusband for the child. He spreads\na cloth beneath a fruit bearing tree,\nand the fruit which he catches is\ntransformed into the wished-for\nchild. The fruit is played by actors,\nwhose metamorphosis into human\nform is perfectly in keeping with\nthe beautifully fluid physical work\nthroughout the tale, which was\nflawlessly interwoven with the nar-rat ive. As the play progresses, a sense\nof magic gradually develops, permeating both movement and\nspeech, completely enthralling, and\ngiving the feeling that one could\nstep in and become part of the stories being told. The final piece, \"The\nLand of the Gods Floats on the\nSea,\" tells of the time before the\nislands of Indonesia were formed,\nwhen only the home of the gods\nfloated upon the water. The people of Indonesia attempt to paddle\ntoward this promised land, but it is\nforever sinking below the horizon,\n\"at the point of sunrise.\" Here\ncomes a wonderful portrayal of the\ntravel by boat; paddles in slow,\nfluid motion, somehow creating a feeling of immense space, of infinite blue. As the play ends I am\nleft with the sense that, having\nbeen taken on a long journey\nthrough the ages and through the\nhuman consciousness, I have\narrived in a safe and peaceful\nplace.\nAbi Kirk.\nLong, Long, Long Ago...\nThe Court Theatre Training\nCompany, Directed by ll an Reichel.

    "content": "10 COLUMNS 5 December 1997\nOn Monday a new\nElectoral Reform\nCommission was\nappointed by Tony Blair. In the\nchair was Lord Jenkins of Hillhead,\nveteran Liberal and Chancellor of\nOxford. The idea of reforming our\nelectoral system seems good - it is\nsurely ripe for improvement, the\nprevious Government have sat on it\nduring their lengthy reign. The 'first\npast the post' system whereby\nMembers of Parliament are chosen\nfrom constituencies, each one\nelecting the person who received\nmost votes, causes many electoral\nreformers to wince. Our beloved\nUnion even elects its officers by the\nSingle Transferable Vote (if you\nwant an explanation of that then\nask at the Union). Public opinion is\nwarming to the idea of change.\nThe only problem, in fact, with\nPR is a simple one. It doesn't work.\nIt's not a new idea, despite what its\nproponents may say. It was mooted during the 1832 Reform Bill, and\nenacted in the 1867 Reform Act.\nThree member constituencies\nexisted, with each elector having\ntwo votes, so the third seat could\ngo to a minor party. In reality the\ndominant party instructed its supporters to spread their votes so it\ncould grab all three seats. It caused\nsuch a political upset in the\nCommons that it was discarded.\nPurer forms of PR exist today,\nnotably in New Zealand, Ireland,\nIsrael, France and Germany. All\nhave had their successes, but the\nfailures are grave. Italy has just\nreformed its system to something\nremarkably like the 'first past the\npost system', having had more governments in the last decade than\nwe have had this century.The reason for this is the coalition pro b lem, something that we don't have,\ndue to the two party tradition and\nour particular constitution. In our\ngovernment, the Prime Minister is\nin effect a temporary dictator,\nwhose word becomes law. He is\nunder continuous scrutiny, and the\npublic can kick him and his government out after five years. This creates a 'strong executive' which\ndeserved, since the government\nobviously didn't get the mandate it\nrequired. However, small parties\ncan exact a greater price. If they are\nbig enough, or can band together\nto become big enough, their continued support may become essential for the government to rule.\nTake the 1977-79 Lib-Lab pact,\nwhere Scots and Welsh called the\nshots, and the Ulster Unionists\nmanaged even to increase the\nnumber of MPs they had representing the area. Governments that\ndepend on coalition support have\nHamish Common Westminster\nEye\nmeans the PM and Cabinet can\ndetermine policy with only advice,\ntheir own conscience and public\nopinion determining it. In a coal i tion, minor parties lend their support in all government bills whether\nthey like them or not, in order for a number of concessions. The concessions they exact would presume\nto be in proportion to the votes\nthey receive. They may also\ndemand ministerial positions. This\nwould tie the hands of the government to particular policies, and\ncause any ministerial reshuffle to\nconsider party affiliations over\nother considerations. This may be\nhistorically shown to be unstable\nand unable to rule in the public\ninterest, simply ruling to serve its\nown coalition partners - thereby\nbetraying the very people who\nelected it.\nThe other, and perhaps more\ninsidious problem with PR is the\ngrowth of the power of the Party.\nPr has become known as \"Party\nRules\". Once you have some PR\nsystem, lists are required of candidates to fill seats, so when the\nseats are allocated, the party can\ntake the top however-many people\nand 'issue' them with a seat. This\ncreates a tremendous power. MPs\nwho dissent against the party line\nmay find themselves lower down\nthe list next time - in some co un tries, being moved a place down\nthe list is the standard punishment\nfor MPs' 'mis demean ours'. This\npower will be retained from the\nsmallest party to the largest. Under\nthis system, MPs in the party's good books may not worry so\nmuch come election time. If high\nup on the list, they are almost guaranteed a seat. In the 'first past the\npost' system, because the swing in\nthe chamber is far more pronounced than the swing in public\nopinion, you may find yourself out\non your ear, as many Tories in former safe seats are adjusting to.\nParties that take a mauling in this\nsystem, with no hope of power for\na number of years, are more likely\nto critically examine themselves\nand try to change for the better\nthan they would under a system\nthat simply slapped them on the\nwrist (or the party could simply\nself-destruct, which not unknown).\nThe other reason suggested for\nLabour's and the Lib Dem's PR idea\nis that there is a permanent left-of-centre consensus, which many\nbelieve would rule for ever if in\npower. PR would help this. The\nTories said the same thing in the\nearly eighties - look what happened\nto them. In reality, if the voter\nwants you out, there is no genuine\nelectoral system on earth that will\nstop them.\nCARROT CAKE\nThis week's insight into culinary\nfantasia is really easy, really\ncheap, really healthy and really\nreally tasty.\nYou will need:\n\u00ab\" 6 oz (150 g) carrots\n2 medium eggs\n4 oz (100 g)d emer ara sugar\n*\" 3 fl oz (80 ml) sunflower oil\n\u2022\u00bb\" 4 oz (100 g) whole meal self-raising flour\n1 tsp ground cinnamon\n*\" Vz tsp ground nutmeg\nor any multiple thereof.\nGrate the carrots using the\nprickly side of a cheese grater. Try\nnot to grate the end of your fin-ter\ngers as well but if you do, don't worry the blood won't spoil the\nflavour. In a large bowl mix the\neggs and the sugar and whisk\ntogether with a fork until all the\nsugar has dissolved and the mixture has become slightly fluffy. Try\nto get as much air into it as possible by lifting the fork out of the\nliquid at each revolution. Now\nadd the oil by pouring it into the\nbowl as a very thin trickle and\nwhisking away vigorously at the\nsame time. An extra pair of hands\ncan be very useful at this stage.\nOnce the oil is in, add the grated\ncarrots and any juice they've produced and give it a quick stir.\nFinally, gently fold in the flour and\nspices. By folding, I mean delicately scooping some mixture up\nfrom the bottom of the bowl and\npl on king it back on top until all the\nflour is just absorbed. The aim\nhere is to keep as many air bubbles in the paste as possible\nwhich makes for a lovely light\ncake.\nNow heavily grease and flour\nyour favourite cake tin, pour in the\nslop and put in the oven, preheated to 375\u00b0F,190 \u00b0C, gas mark 5.\nThe cake should take 20-25 minutes to cook. To check whether\nit's ready or not, poke a knife in\nthe cake and pull it out. If the\nknife comes out clean, the cake is\nready, if it comes out with bits\nattached, the cake is not. Sorted?\nAntoine\n\n"

    "content": "NEWS 5 December 1997\nJCB Causes Power \"Chaos\nANDREW OFORI\nAfter the devastating power surge\nof 16 November, the hapless\nChemistry department has once\nagain been afflicted with electrical problems. Before 9am on\nMonday the RCS1 building was\nsuddenly cloaked in darkness.\nThe cause was soon traced to\nsub-contractors on the BMS\nbuilding site who had still failed\nto notice the fact they had grazed\nthe electric mains feed to RCS1.\nThe company responsible for\nthe BMS building venture, Schal,\nhad informed the sub-contractors\nof the presence of power lines in\nthe area they were excavating and\nadvised them to dig to a safe level\nusing the JCB digger and then finish\nthe task by hand, as is common\nbuilding practice. Unfortunately the\nsub-contractors attempted to complete the excavation using just the\nJCB and consequently struck a power line. As news of the 'black-out' spread to the building site and\nthe cause was established, the JCB\ndriver and his guide were dismissed\noff site and replaced.\nChris Sousman, the building\nsupervisor from the Chemistry\ndepartment, described the situation that ensued in RCS1 as\n\"chaos\". Due to the lack of electrical equipment to control experiments as well as the loss of light-ing, the building was evacuated and\nsealed. Morning lectures for the\nchemists were moved to the Civil\nEngineering building. The major\ndamage caused as a result of the\nincident extended to: disruptions\nto timetables, ruined experiments,\ndegraded or destroyed samples\nand lost computer data.\nLondon Electricity Board had\nrepaired the damage by 4pm on\nMonday. Ian Cillett, IC'S Safety\nOfficer, carried out a full safety\ninspection before the power was\neventually switched back on at\n8.30am on Tuesday. He stated that\ndisruption to the department had\nbeen kept to a minimum, but\nadded he was unable to assess\nhow severely safety levels were\ncompromised until the incident's full effects had been evaluated. Illustration: Stavros Polyviou\nLabour MP Talks Conservative MP Talks\nPATRICK HAYES\nOn Tuesday 2nd December,\nImperial College Labour Club\nplayed host to Tony Wright, MP\nfor Cannock Chase, and chair of\nthe Constitutional Affairs Select\nCommittee.\nHe spoke of \"the dramatic\nchange which the Labour Party has\nundergone in recent years, with the\nparty bouncing back from the election defeat of 1992\". He also\nreferred to a new, third way in pol-it ics, often called the \"Radical\nCentre\", speaking of the decline of\nthe 1980s market doctrine and\nThatcherism, and the waning of a public belief in the old left's idea\nthat \"a bigger state is a better\nstate\" describing this as \"not sus-tain able.\" He concluded saying\nLabour must use its huge majority\nto drive the country through this\nperiod of \"radical uncertainty\"\nahead of the millennium.\nHe then faced stiff questioning\nfrom the audience on a range of\ntopics including the issue of benefits for single mothers. On this\npoint he reinforced the govern-ment's determination to end the\n\"dependency culture,\" adding that\nadditional money had been made\navailable by Gordon Brown to help\nlone parents into work. Mr Wright's last point was that New Labour was\nbuilt on Old Labour values but with\ncoherent positions which people\ncould understand.\nVERONIQUE NEVEUX\nOn Wednesday, Sir George\nYoung, shadow defence minster,\naddressed an audience of t wen ty-one people at a meeting in\nthe Mechanincal Engineering\nDepartment.\nInvited by the ICU\nConservative Society, Sir George\nspoke out against Tony Blair and\nhis 'New Labour' party, describing\nthe cabinet as a. \"Pernicious cock-tail\". Issues such as European\nUnion and priv it is ation were also\nraised during the talk.\nPhoto: Veronique Nevuex\nImperial Students Fall Victim to Conmen\nFELIX NEWS TEAM\nFelix has learned that professional confidence tricksters operating\naround London are targeting foreign students at train and bus\nstations. At least three IC students have been ripped off this\nterm, and have lost up to \u00a3100\neach.\nThe men are adopting a cunning guise, posing as professionals\nclaiming to have been mugged and\nneeding a loan.\nOne of the victims was\napproached whilst walking in Earl's Court on the evening of Monday\n17th November. The victim\ndescribed the incident as follows:\n\"I was stopped by an upper\nmiddle class looking, tall, slim\nwhite man wearing a grey suit and\naged between thirty-five and forty.\nHe asked me the way to Edgware\nRoad to get to the Ml. Looking\nvery tired, he informed me that he\nhad been mugged in Heathrow by\ntwo black youths and he had\nreported it to the police and that he\nhad been walking since 8pm. He\nsaid that they took his money, his\nticket and bag so now he was going\nto hitchhike from the MI. He said\nhe was a professional golfer and\nplayed for Scotland and teaches\ngolf in London and usually flies\nfrom London to Edinburgh. He told\nme that he was a devout Christian\nand would return the money in two\ndays' time on Wednesday\"\nConvinced by the man's story\nand appearance the victim gave the\nman \u00a3100. In return he was given\nan address and telephone number\nwhich later proved to be false.\n\"I reported it to the police and\nthey informed me that this kind of\nthing was common in London. I could not believe my stupidity at\nbeing conned like this but on talking to other pe o peI realised that\nthis also happened to many other\npeople when they initially came to\nLondon.\"\nThe man was described as\n\"smartly dressed wearing a grey\ntrousers, black shoes, a grey blazer\nand a pink shirt. He had brownish\nhair with a parting from the side.\nThe hair was 1.5 inches long, he\nwas not bald. He did not carry a bag or anything else and had a Scottish accent.\"\n\n"

An\nasteroid at the millennium has\nbrought about the collapse of civilisation and only now are the survivors of the cataclysm able to\nrebuild their society.\nYou play Arkhan, a Guardian of\nFire in the city of Sparta, a sort of\narmy lieutenant in a bustling outpost offering salvation and shelter.\nAfter being disfigured by a deadly\npoison your task, as Arkhan, is to\ngo in search of a cure. However the\ncity is full of treachery and where\nthose at the echelons of power are\nforging ahead with their own agen-das, Arkhan will undoubtedly cross\ntheir paths.\nDark Earth is a3rd person\nadventure game, with you in complete control of the 3d character of\nArkhan. Controlling the character\naround the beautifully pre-rendered\nscreens is a treat, the animated\ncharacters are fluid (166MHz PC is\nrecommended) and the in game\nspeech is varied and unobtrusive,\nsince you can read the text and\nthen skip the speech which runs\nconcurrently. The game play is not\nlimited to picking up objects and to\ntalking to other characters, a combat mode allows Arkhan to fight in\nfull 3d, and with a huge assortment\nweapons, from axes to rifles.\nThe story line is incredibly tight\nand you find yourself going from\none place to another because you\nsimply have no other options. At\ntimes Dark Earth is frustrating when\nyou get stuck but this is the same\nwith all role playing games but the\nsimplistic keyboard control, the\nmedieval look of the game and the\nreal time 3d graphics, makes you\npersevere.\nThere are quite a few adventure\ngames out at the moment, so compared with other adventure games\nsuch as Blade Runner reviewed last\nweek, which one should you go\nfor? Personally 1 found Blade\nRunner's plot far to complicated\nwith too many threads happening\nall at the same time. Its four CDs\nare quit a bit daunting, but the\ngame wraps you totally in its Blade\nRunner atmosphere and this is\nwhat makes it an excellent game.\nDark Earth on the other hand has a greater pace and you will find yourself moving swiftly between\nscreens but there are enough stumbling blocks to keep the game chal-leng ing. So you could play a game\nwith a20 year old history and that\nhas been rehashed in every single\nscience fiction film or you could go\nfor something that has an original\ntheme with equally excellent graphics and game play.

Maxwell was soon\nproved wrong with the development of atomic physics, and I was\nsoon proved wrong when Namco\nreleased Tekken2.\nWhen Tekken 1 was released,\nalong with the playstation, it was a truly ground-breaking game, but\ndid not achieve wide recognition\ndue to the large number of combat\ngames on the market. Tekken was,\nand is, a superb game combing\nspeed, fine graphics and a wide\narray of characters with plenty of\nhumour and a hundreds of slick\nmoves to give a game that never\ngets boring. Better still, smashing\nthe shit out of your flat mates/ ene-mies using a heavily armoured\ntiger, with all the sound and gory\ngraphics to boot, certainly helped\nto preserve my sanity during my\ndegree. The number of websites\nthat can be found, created by\nfanatic devotees of the game and\nintent on documenting every one\nof the moves, features and tricks\nbears testimony to the excellence\nof Tekken.\nSo when my flat mate, in one of\nhis more god-like mano eu vers, returned to the nest with a copy of\nthe newly released Tekken 2, I did-n't see how much it could have\nimproved over its predecessor. The\nanswer is; a great deal. The game\nhad improved so much, in fact, that\nleaving the flat for lectures was out\nof the question. Tekken had given\nme an aim in life - something tangible I could actually achieve - to\nbeat up the world and its mother\nusing my very own digital super-hero.\nNamco had added another\nbunch of characters, improved the\nspeed, graphics and play ability, overhauled the menu system and\nincluded two new modes - a practice mode and a team battle mode.\nOh, and did I mention shed loads\nmore moves? All these changes\nmade it easier to get sucked deeper into the game, and 1 was.\nSo this time, unlike Maxwell,\nI'm going to get this right; Tekken2\nis the second best combat game.\nMake way, mortals, for TEKKEN3\nJeremy\nTekken2 costs around \u00a335 from\nthe usual outlets. Tekken can be\npicked up second hand for \u00a310\u00a315.

    "content": "5 December 1997 MUSIC 17\nSINGLES\nBlue Seed - The Only Ones\nQuiet verses, then a loud chorus. It's been done\nbefore. Bush have done it and look where it got\nthem. The verses are alright but only in that I have no particular opinion of them. However,\nthe chorus is drowned out by a mass of distortion making whatever else that might be present\ninaudible. Why does the guitar player always\ninsist that he has to have his amplifier louder\nthan everything else? Blue Seed do not rock.\nThey suck.\nElliot Green - Come On\nThis is bog standard stuff. A whining string-bending riff accompanies the verse and the chorus tries hard to be uplifting. However, I don't think Elliot Green's delivery of 'So, come on, get\nwith what you want!' is going to get teenagers\njumping up and down. Mind you, some blok e once said, 'You gotta roll with it', and got away\nwith it.\nLightning Seeds - What You Say\nShrewdly placed as track one on their current\nBest Of.... Album, JL/7<e You Do, you'll only have\nto listen to this a few times before you find the\ntune banging around in your head. Not in the\nsame vein as their usual happy-go-lucky singles\nbut a quality Seeds tune nonetheless. However,\nforget about this single. Do yourself a favour and\nbuy the album.\nPeach - On My Own\nThis is number one in Israel It's currently the\nfastest rising single in the US chart and gets\nmore airplay than any other British band.\nImpressed? No? Neither am I. It was released\nover here a while ago but the UK ignored it.\nThat's because we're not fooled into buying\ncommercial drivel just because it's got a sexy\nlead singer, an easily hum mable tune and some\nstupid lyrics. On no, not us!\nMonk and Canatella \u2022 Who's Who?\nI'm a firm believer that you can judge some CDs\nby their cover. I saw this and thought it'd be\nsome sort of quirky song with samples from\nHorror B Movies and spooky noises all thrown\ntogether and then completed by a gothic voiceover from the singer. I was right. I'm actually a powerful psychic in disguise, you know. Give me\nanother cover!\nTHE ESSEN TIA! CHOON Naomi - Personal Touch\nOh dear! I can tell what this sounds like just by\nthe name alone. This is some ponce y manufactured woman singer, probably kicked off some\nsoap opera, telling us she's happy, free and\nloves her man. Wrong! This is, in fact, a cracking\nlittle stomper of a track. Naomi is only 19 years\nold and could show some of the recent female\nangst fakers how to do it properly. 'I don't need\nyour personal touch!' she screams. Oh, hit me,\nNaomi, let me be your slave, hit me Er, sorry\nabout that.\nThe Saw Doctors - Simple Things\n'It's the simple things that make it all worth-while.' The familiarity of the Irish accent makes\nsure that this song comes across as genuine.\nTake note, people. A softly sung little ditty with\njust a light drum beat, an acoustic guitar and a gushy theme. It works, you know.\nSheryl Crow - Tomorrow Never Dies\nI can't tell you why but this is definitely a' James Bond song. Maybe it's because\nshe sounds like some classy under-rated singer\nin some late night smoky bar. Maybe it's because of the seductive guitar sound. Maybe\nit's because of the dramatic violin break. Or\nmaybe it's just because I actually knew it was\nthe latest James Bond song. Who knows?\nSparks vs. Faith No More - This Town Ain't Big\nEnough for the Both of Us\nStupid! Stupid! Stupid! This track is ridiculous. It\nsounds like an attempt at mock-rock-opera or\nsomething. I cannot stress how annoying this\ntrack is. Initially, you appreciate its comedy\nvalue but then you come to realise that at the\nend of the day it's just a huge pile of horses hit.112 If Cod Will Send His Angels\n1 feel that I should like this song. There's not\nreally that much to have a go at. 1 mean, at least\nI'm not listening to some third-rate indie band\ntrying to do a cover of Pretty Vacant. Well, act u ally, maybe that'd be better. It'd be interesting.\nI wouldn't fall asleep during it. There's only one\nreal reason why I don't like this song: It's boring.\nRobbie Williams - Angels\n'Tonight we have a young man by the name of\nRobert Williams. He is currently working as a professional entertainer. He has sung before in a5 piece dance act. However, this didn't work\nout and tonight he's hoping that this could be\nhis next big break. So, Robert, tell them who\nyou're going to be.' 'Well, tonight Matthew, I'm going to be Elton John.' No, but seriously, this is\na half-decent effort from the former b lobster. H Dennis\nCLUBSCENE - CLUB REVIEW\nPM SCIENTISTS\nWEDNESDAYS @ SMITHFIELDS EC1\nT he people responsible for this\nnight had clearly put a considerable degree of effort into\nproviding the discerning club-goer\nwith a quality night out. For my\nmoney, there cannot realistically be\na better musical combination in a club than the darkest jungle to get\nhot and sweaty to, coupled with an\neclectic spectrum ranging from the\nabstract to the just plain phat for\nyou to chill out to.\nThe problem was that it was all\njust too ambitious. I cannot see\nhow this basic blueprint would\nwork in a club with a capacity\nbelow 500, and squeezing half this\nnumber into Smithfields would certainly not have been comfortable.\nThe likelihood of this scenario,\nhowever was only slightly greater\nthan that of a syndicate of flying\npigs winning the Lottery. Let's face\nit, how many out there can afford\nto throw caution to the wind, go\nout on a Wednesday night and give\nit all they've got, without the\nprospect of getting up on a Thursday morning hanging high\nabove their heads? On the evidence of this night, not many. I left\nthis club feeling a tad depressed\nand disillusioned.\nDespite everything, the music\nWAS good (playing Gary Numan's Cars gets a pat on the back from\nme for sheer audacity), and once\non the jungle dancefloor it went\nbeyond being merely a minute\npatch of desolation and I finally\nstepped on it. I quickly got very\ninto it and found myself being taken\nto that plateau that all c lubbers know and love. And although they\nquite severely lacked quantity, the\nheads that were there went part of\nthe way towards making up for this\nin quality.\nIt's just a crying shame that\nexcessive ambition on behalf of the\npromoters led to blatant oversights\nwhich quite simply ruined the experience for me. 1 feel 1 can, however,\nrecommend this night to you if you\nare part of a group of like-minded\nindividuals with a love for the music\nand a complete disregard for\nThursday morning lectures. If you\nfit this bill then you will definitely\nhave a wicked night, just be sure to\ninvite me along.. EE\nMart\n\n"

She was also the main songwriter\nand brought us gems such as\nCepetto and Feed the Tree.\n(Disappointingly for this reviewer\nshe didn't play them).\nGot to the venue and initially\ntrouble was brewing when we got\nto the door. There was a problem\nwith the tickets, they weren't there\n(as if 1 wasn't expecting this any-way), but another flick through the\nenvelopes revealed the pair. We\nwere in, it was packed, and just in\ntime for the last part of the support\nband The Warm Jets' set. Their\nsong Hurricane deserves a mention just because of its utter sub-lime ness and forced restraint as\nthough trying to hold back, to prevent from going totally ballistic.\nTanya and co. arrived a little\nlate to an impressively enthusiastic\ncrowd. A slow ie from the recent\nalbum Lovesongs For Underdogs\nlulled everyone into a dreamy\nsense of contentment, her voice is\nexquisitely penetrating. She exuded a much greater commanding\npresence (compared to her Belly\ndays) and proves that total heavy\ngrunge, coated with a generous\nhelping of pop is not out of the\nquestion, with blinding tracks like\nBright Light and Pretty Deep. On\nthe first single from the album,\nBum, her voice is impossibly per-fec t. Accusations of playing nice,\nsweet, bland pop can be dismissed\nimmediately.\nFor the encore Tanya returned\nalone and treated everyone to\nanother potent dose of her\nrefreshing voice.\nFor those fans who were raring\nto hear a few old Belly numbers,\nthey were not let down or forgotten by Tanya who decided to play\nus a couple, namely, Low Red\nMoon with its discordant ly fluid\nguitar and the rush along, manic\nDusted. She is too good to us. E3 Jason\nCURVE\nKing's College Union\nIn1991 I heard a song called 10\nLittle Girls, from the debut EP\nby a band called Curve. It was\nthe single most inventive, novel\nsound I had ever heard up until\nthen (I had, admittedly, been a little sheltered). Sure, baggy was\ncool, but Curve were different.\nWithin a year, they had conquered\nthe 'indie' market with a string of\nclassic EP's. After two albums, and\na year of relentless touring, they\nimploded amid rumours of break-downs, addiction and ego over-load. Bands like Garbage and\nSneaker Pimps took their blueprint\nof sex, goth, elastic basslines and\nmore sex, and made a mint. And\nsuddenly, nobody remembered\nCurve anymore. But they were\nalways too bloody-minded to just\nlie down and die like a dog, and at\nlast they're back with their spanking new single (Chinese Burn) getting Sony Minidisc sponsored\nadvertising. In Kings College,\nthere's only really one question the\ncrowd want answered - are they\nstill relevant? And Curve answer\nwith a resounding err rm mmm. Musically, they've taken the\nnext logical step on from their last\nproper release, the Superblaster\nEP, by becoming even more indus-trial, trowelling on layers of fuzz\nand noise over Toni Halliday's she-devil vocals. Sweef Back and\nAlligator sound like NIN remixed by\nThird Eye Foundation, and it's wor-ry ingly apparent that the gorgeous\nmelodies of old may well have\nbeen sacrificed for a even more\npowerful sound. But all the time\nToni's voice brings the songs back\nfrom the edge of meltdown as she\nvents years of frustration on us,\nlooking more severe than ever in\nlashing s of black make-up and\na dead-crow hairstyle. A heavier\nthan ever Fait Accompli is revived\nto a rapturous reception, and\nthings seem to be going to plan\nuntil a faulty fire alarm forces us all\nout of the building for half an hour.\nWhen the gig finally resumes, Curve\nrattle through Chinese Burn and\nCome Clean before some desultory\nguitar trashing and an almost\nembarrassed exit. Still relevant\nthen? Errrmmmm.\nNorm\n\n"

    "content": "5 December 1997\nIN THE PLAYHOUSES\nARTS\nTHE JEWISH WIFE and THE JEWISH DAUGHTER\nBertolt Brecht and Sonja Linden\n23\nT he New End Theatre, New\nEnd, Hampstead is a very\nsmall, intimate venue, with\nseventy-five seats, and a space at\nthe front, as opposed to a stage,\nwhere all the action takes place.\nThis increased the impact that the\nplays had on me, and 1 have a feeling that both would possibly be less\neffective in a larger venue. The first\nplay, The Jewish Wife, opens with a woman, Judith, telephoning her\nfriends, cancelling bridge engage-ment s, telling them that she's going away for a few weeks, and\nasking them to look after her hus-band, Fritz. She then rehearses the\nthings she wants to tell him, the\nreason for her leaving, that she's only leaving for his sake. He is, of\ncourse, German, and the play is set\nin 1937, when already the Jews\nwere beginning to feel the hatred of\nthe Nazis. The husband tries to\npersuade her not to leave, but they\nboth know that she will, that it's the\nbest thing. She, however, cannot\ntell him what she is really thinking\nand feeling. The play ends with him\ntaking her to the station to catch\nher train. As the one play ends the\nsecond begins. In this companion\npiece, the actress and actor playing\nthe wife and husband turn out to\nbe married, and the actress,\nAmanda, is the granddaughter of\nJudith. Her mother, Ruth, is in the\naudience, and she enters into the\ndrama, as Amanda reveals that she\nis preparing to leave her husband\nPeter. Ruth tries to persuade her\nnot to, and many powerful emotions are displayed.\nTo begin with, there is the supposed anti-Semitism of Peter,\nwhich Amanda is using as an\nexcuse to leave him. The play\nmoves on, examining both Ruth's relationship with Judith, and\nAmanda's relationship with Ruth.\nBoth women have a lack of a father-figure in their lives, which\nleads to them being unable to form\ngood, lasting relationships with\nmen. The argument rages on, with\nall three hitting and hurting each\nother, in an almost childish way.\nThe play ends with Peter and\nAmanda resolving to talk to each\nother, a complete contrast to\nJudith and Fritz, who, although they\nlove each other, cannot talk to\neach other anymore:\nThese plays are primarily about\nlack of communication, and about\nthe way that people tend to think\nand rehearse things they want to\nsay to each other, yet never manage to speak to each other, or\nwhen they do actually speak, say\nnothing. The first play is a political\nstatement.\nBrecht, forced into exile, wrote\na series of plays called \"Fear and\nMisery in the Third Reich\" which\nobviously couldn't be performed in\nGermany. Brecht himself was number five on Hitler's death list. These\nseries of plays were a definite\nattempt on Brecht's part to try and\nforce people to understand what\nwas really happening in Germany,\nand where the madness would lead\nthem to. The Jewish Wife is a very\nclear picture of the devastating\nimpact that the Nazis had on pe o ple's lives. The second play is also\nemotionally charged; set in the present day, it shows how little things\nhave changed, and how events\nfrom our past can influence the\nway we live today. This play\nexplored many themes, including\nthe after-effects of the war, the\nrelationship between men and\nwomen, the relationship between\nmothers and daughters and the\njealousy felt by mothers as their\ndaughters become sexually active. I really enjoyed these plays, they're\nthoughtful, they're thought-provo k ing, they're tense and they're inter-e sting. They are only showing on\nSunday and Monday nights until\nthe 15th of December, and are well\nworth a visit. The tickets will cost\nyou seven pounds, and the nearest\ntube is Hampstead. There's also a very good pub just next door.\nJulia H The Jewish Wife with The Jewish\nDaughter\nDirected by Emily Gottlieb and performed by Limetree Productions.\nShowing at the New End Theatre,\n27 New End, NW3.

Shows 8pm Sunday\nand Monday. \u00a310, \u00a37 students.\n27 - A PERSONAL RETROSPECTIVE\nJohn Keats\nT his play deals with the fragmented memories of a27 year old man; a personal ret-ros pec ti ve. It's from his point of\nview so you could be forgiven for\nexpecting a boy's own adventure,\nbut in reality it is written by a man\nrather than for a man. Whichever, it\nis an insight and it touched me;\nresulting in a delayed response, it\ntriggered a backwash of memory\nripples that I haven't had since God\nknows when.\nThe Fecund Theatre use (rather\nthan abuse) their chosen tools\nwhich comprise of radio-micro-phones, video, cool music, n arra tion, action, movement, s ug ges tion, and seamless integration. The\nmulti-media dimension doesn't detract, it abstracts compliments\nand provides depth and colour to\nthe passion, conscience and\nhumour of the performers.\nThe piece itself is well-balanced\nand accomplished, it is not so\nmuch a rites of passage production\nas a montage of feelings and dealings that make the man or perhaps\nun-make the boy. An ordinary, settled childhood dappled with\nhumour and loss begins to unravel\nwhen Paul - the focus of our attention learns - betrayal at first hand.\nAt the time it is the ultimate\nteenage nightmare. The girl he\nloves, his first love and the receiver\nof his virginity is found in bed with\nhis best mate. Oh dear. Paul is not\nhappy and the seed is sown. A pivotal point has been reached; until\nnow young teen Paul was as high\nas he could go on his playground\nswing without it going loop-the-loop, experiencing the exhilaration\nof weightlessness that is childhood\nat the full extent of its swing. He\nmay well have regained control if it\nhadn't been for his Uncle Dick\n'bee ring' in with the \"treat 'em\nmean keep em keen\" adage.\nUp to this point the professional cast had charmed us, with magical memories; Saturday grand-stand, rainy Sunday boredom, the\nnightmare child catcher from 'Chitty\nchitty bang bang' and 'Jaws'. All\nwell observed and tightly per-formed. Now we see a change of\nfocus, the camera begins to swing\naround and we begin to see a decline, the degradation of a wholesome boy to half a man.\nTeenage parties, student arrogance and debauchery b lag and\nbluster their way to the very suburbs of Babylon - fully fledged\n'a ving it, cash splash nose-powder\nland. These club-drug drug-clubbed\npunter stunt scenes looked and\nsounded fantastic, but lacked the\nsharp focus of the first half. Excess\nupon excess left protagonist Paul a hollow character, not even mildly\nattractive to the audience. His\neventual awakening in the entrails\nof his own hung-drawn and quartered existence, was well due.\nHe ended the performance\nwith a grin, which might have provoked the un tempered amongst us\nto loosen a couple of his teeth.\nHowever, the audience showed no\nsigns of violence; they just clapped\nand whooped (in an English sort of\nway) because it was an excellent\nshow. I thought that that would be\nthat, ninety minutes of intelligent\nand kicking entertainment but not\ntoo much to think about. However,\nwithin twenty-four hours I was\nthinking of memories, friends,\nexperiences; a personal retrospective. Fecund seem to be searching\nfor the ultimate definition of existence; strangely epi tomis ed in the\nSchrodinger's girlfriend scene\nwhere teenage Paul puts his love\non the line, presenting the ques-tion(aire) 'Will you go out with me.\nYES [] or NO []. An ultimate if ever\nI saw one.\nLuis Stooles\n27 - A Personal Retrospective\nPresented by the Fecund Theatre\nand showing at the Oval House,\n52-54 Kennington Oval, SE11.\nTube: Oval.\nShows are 7.45pm Thursday to\nSunday until 14 December. \u00a37.50,\n\u00a34.50 students.\n\n"

    "content": "5 December 1997 COLUMNS\nYou have escaped politics for a couple of weeks, so I'm afraid\nyou'll have to indulge an old man\nfor a few minutes. Is it me, or has\nyoung Mr Mandelson disappeared? A short time ago, the king\nof spin was omnipresent, but of\nlate He seems to have vanished up\nhis own rebuttal. By pure coincidence, wheels are failing off the\nNew Labour bandwagon with all\nthe drama of Nigel Mansell's Williams, an unfortunate analogy\nin the current circumstances.\nMandelson is in the unfortunate\nposition of being both invaluable\nand politically unacceptable. Such\nis the mastery of His brief (sub-vert ing the democratic\nprocess/running Britain), He has\nbeen a victim of His own success.\nSurely Mandy would have spotted\nTobaccogate before it got messy.\nNo doubt He would have known\nthat cutting benefits to single\nmothers would enrage His back-bench ers. At this rate, the growing\nsigns of political arrogance should\nbe reigned in by public disgruntle-ment. One can but hope.\nI shall now do something that I rarely, if ever, do in this august\njournal. 1 shall say something nice\nabout College Catering. I had the\noccasion to be at the 75th Anniversary Dinner of The\n'22 Club on\nSaturday. I must\nsay that, save for\na couple of\nminor glitches,\nCatering did a very good job.\nThe food was\ngood, as was the\nwine and the\nservice. It just\ngoes to show\nthat this department can perform\nwhen it gets its act together.

To describe a video of a few peas and model sheep vibrating on a washing machine as\n'immensely funny' indicates that he\nor she is peerless ly ironic or deeply\ndisturbed (or the recipient of a back-hand er). The Ante Room,\nafter its recent refurbishment, has\nbeen raised from the status of a hovel to a fine venue. For it to be\nused to accommodate such\nrubbish, bereft of any talent,\nis verging on the criminal. I am, as\nyou all know, very broad-minded,\never-willing to embrace new ideas\nor thinking, but this is too much. A much better idea would be to\nobtain works of art from other col-lect ions.

This is a serious letter so\nyou'd better print it!\nDear Felix,\nIn lieu of the recent 1CU Presidential election we at MS\nthought that a few facts should be\nput Into perspective. Combined as\nwe now are St Mary's and Charing\nCross and Westminster Medical\nschools have approximately 1100\nstudents and taking into account\nthe number of people on elective\nor residency it is closer to 1000.\nOut of these 1000 people, there\nwere more than 700 votes cast and\neven us i numerate medical students can work out that this\nequates to a70% turn out. 1C non-medics however, of which there\nabout 7000, still only managed to\nequal the medics with about 700\nvotes also, again with these easy\nnumbers it is clear to see that there\nwas only a10% turn out. Now there\nis only one way to say this to you\nguys (and girls) over there... you\nare pants!\nSo, does this mean the beginning of the end for IC? If this result\nmeans that we as medics are 7\ntimes more motivated than non-medics on issues such as Student\nUnion affairs can this be extrapolated into other areas of IC? An\nInteresting fact that you might not\nbe aware of is that the average\nannual intake into any single academic course at IC is around 30 students on the other hand next year\nthe intake into ICSM will be just\nover 300 which means that by the\nyear 2002 there will be nearly 2000\nmedics at IC. With this number of\nstudents each with 7 times the\nmotivation than their non-medic\ncounter parts is there any hope left\nfor 1C? Well I 'll leave this tricky one\nup to your imagination but what 1\nwill say to you is don't worry about\nbeing swallowed up by IC.\nP.S.

UO^'i irix t!1.1 JAN NY MOWELL5 (SOUetCH)\nCLUBSCENE - SINGLES\nT his double CD has been put\ntogether by one of the leading\nlights in the underground electronic music scene. One of the original purveyors of progressive house\nmusic in the early 90's. The first CD is full of original\nclassics from the Guerrilla label, taking us back to tunes that have heavily influenced today's dance scene.\nUsing only tracks from one label 1\nthought there were bound to be\nsome weak tracks. But I'm glad to\nsay 1 was wrong and was reminded\nhow many classics Gorilla have\nnotched up over the years. It makes\nyou wonder why the label closed\ndown with tracks like Fuzzy Logic's Obsessions, React 2 Rhythm's Whatever You Dream and Dr\nAtomic's Schudelfloss .\nA high standard of mixing by Phil\nPerry is maintained throughout the\nCD which is worth the money alone,\nbut amazingly you get another quality CD for the same price. And this\nreally is a bargain.\nThe second CD is made up of\nremixes of Guerrilla tunes, many\nfrom the first CD, but you'd be mistaken to think that this one sounded\nsimilar to the first. It has a totally\ndifferent feel; still in the realms of\nprogressive house this but this time\nit's right up to date.\nStarting off on the break-beat\nside of house music, again with\nsome superb mixing by the up &.\ncoming Danny Howells, you take a hypnotic journey through all areas Of\nhouse music, the pace gradually\nbuilding throughout the CD and climaxing in excellent hard house/\ntechno with remixes from the likes\nof Digweed, Carl Cox 8^ Van Dyke.\nAll in all, this is one of the very\nbest mixed compilations around at\nthe moment. No cheesy fillers, no\nlame un-involved mixing and no hint\nof commercial it y it is well worth\nchecking, a nugget of gold in the\nmountain of commercial compilation rubbish being put out for the\nChristmas rush. This is one out of\nthe many mixed CDs I 've received\nover the past month that I will actual listen to again and again. It's nice\nto see Jackpot keeping the vibe\nalive.\nTo see the Jackpot crew in\naction you can catch them at their\nweekly outings to Subterrania, 12\nAcklam Rd, Ladbroke Grove,\nLondon. 10pm3 a m.F!\\c\\ Jo Public\n\u20220 I' II Mr mm \u00bb GA1 Prisoners of Technoiogy(P.O.T) \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nDelicate Beats/ What does it All Mean\n(Fresh Kutts)\nRelease Date: Out Now\nP.O.T have come up with another two absolutely storming tracks. Delicate Beats is on that\njump up tip again, but with fresh arrangements\nand another funky fresh original b line, it's gonna' be massive. What does it all Mean, has\na more stepping feel to it, and that b line that\ncan't help but get all twisted out of shape &get\nyou jumping all over the place. Wicked.\nUSA. West Coast/East Coast\n(Formation) \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 1 / 2\nRelease date: Early Dec.\nUSA, a subsidiary of Formation, has finally\nreleased West Coast/ East Coast a absolutely\nmassive tune that I 've heard the likes of Fabio\ndropping for the past year or so. This dark step-per cuts back &. forth between amen breaks,\nsquelch ey bass tones and spin backs.\nGuaranteed to send any crowd crazy, sounds\nquite superb in the mix. Well worth checking.\nJohn B.f a zz Sessions EP\n(Formation Records) kkk k Release date: Early Dec.\nThis 3-track EP is designed to give us a taste of\nJohn B's forthcoming album. VCS is a very synthetic piece; acid-washed and stained with\nsprinklings of a distorted bassline, this is techno\ntranslated into breakbeat language! Jazz\nSessions combines both the synthetic and\norganic elements, with crazy bassline madness\nand an excellent breakbeat fighting for attention\nover some punchy samples. And that's just the\nbeginning. Once this track actually kicks off,\nthere's no stopping it!\nIntermolecular Forces. 10*1/10*2\n(Molecular Rec.) * * *\nTrack 10*1 is very minimal and very hypnotic,\nwith the barest of back beat and not much\nelse. This one is strictly for the head strong.\n/0*2 is a bit more easy going, if you can say\nthat about a techno track, with fast driven\nbeats and off-key strings a must for all techno\nheads.\nPunk Floyd. Piper At New Cross\n(Euktech) \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 1 / 2\nI liked this one, hard 'n' fast beats, cool bend y sounds setting a nice hard house / techno\nthing going on. A track that stands out from\nmany more plain techno tracks I 've heard. This\nwill definitely keep an up-for-it crowd going\nmental on the dance floor.\nTechno/House\nRandom 2 - The Gary Numan Remixes\n(Beggars Banquet) \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nThis is the second EP of remixes of the 80's pop maestro's work. The B side contains two\nbrilliant remixes of Cars. Mike Dearborn completely mashes up this old hit and gives it a dark and sinister 4/4 edge. Meanwhile Dave\nClarke leaves the basic structure of the track\nmore or less intact, but spices up the funk fac-tor!\nDale Lawrence - Theorem (+8) \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nRichie Hawtin's Canadian label serves up this\noffering of deep and mystical vibes to continue\nits abstract musical journey. Mantra One is a minimal yet very rhythmic track. Os can best\nbe described as aural beauty; gentle and all ur ing. Think of the most beautiful sunset you've\nseen and imagine it as a piece of music. Clone\nis a serving of more minimal beats with a funky\ntwist that surprisingly works very well.\nSima. Give You Myself.\n(Mo's Music) \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nThis track is too strongly in the song style for\nme, but the Skunk Dub mix saves the day.\nStripping away those over-used lyrics and\nreplacing them with a looped sample of the\nvocal and adding fatter beats makes sure that it\nworks out alright in the end.\nS J.I Feel Divine\n(React Rec.) \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 1 / 2\nYou've a host of mixes to choose from on these\ntwo 12\". Either a Hard house/Trancey 12\" or a Garage/ House 12\". My favourite is the Baby\nDoc mix in a hard house style which works well\nwith S J's lyrics. The best of the other 12\" is Tall\nPaul's reworking. The Dem 2 garage mix is just\ntoo weak 'n slow with no punch and not enough\nto keep the floor moving.\nHi-Life Feat. Da Scat Cat. Crosswordz/\nBelieve Me. (Boom Dynamite) kkk k This is one of the best garage tunes I 've heard\nin a while, fat 'n' funky. Clean crisp beats and\nnice vocals. With two mixes of each you can't go wrong. These tunes have got some seriously\nfat 'n' fresh b line business going on Believe Me.\nSlam Mode. The Pink Horizon EP\n(Deep Worldwide Music) \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nAll the tracks here are soulful and groovy 6am house music designed to bring you back down\nto earth rather than take you higher! Ceres\nAquatica is a light and stylish little number with\nseductive strings. Anemone Blanda is a delicately produced track, definitely designed to\nsoothe and chill out the listener. Space lets the\nside down in my opinion, sounding as if it is trying to be a\" trance y\" house track, but failing to\nsound convincing. That aside, this EP should not\nbe ignored. EE JP & al;ck\n\n"

For the record\nCharing Cross had the best finals\nresults in London and was ranked\none of the top medical schools in\nthe country before the merger. This\nis exactly why College wanted us to\nbe part of Imperial in the first\nplace.\nTo say that Charing Cross\nmedics are unsophisticated and\nneed raising to the South\nKensington academic standard\np rooves that he has not made any\neffort to get to know anyone at\neither of the medical schools and is\njust writing rubbish as he grinds his\nown peculiar and very personal\naxe.\nWhat his motivation for these\narticles is 1 do not know. I have no\nobjection to having anything said\nabout me provided that some of\nwhat is said is true.\nIf Simon wants to come over to\nCharing Cross some time he would\nbe very welcome and then, after\nthat, if he still feels the same way\nthen he is at least writing from a position of knowledge insta ed of\nthe position of ignorance that he\ncurrently occupies.\nYours sincerely,\nNick Newton, ICSM\nSORRY NOT.\nDear Lads\n1 am writing to apologise for\nthe appalling play and total lack of\nprofessionalism that I demonstrated last Wednesday.

    "content": "12 FEATURE 5th December 1997\nCrude on Campus\nRoger Geffen reports on how IC is linked to Oil Companies, and why we should be\nworried about it.\nThis week in Kyoto, Governments from around\nthe world are meeting to discuss climate\nchange. They are taking part in the Third\nConference of the Parties to the Convention on\nClimate Change. They have a mandate to set\ntargets and timetables for limiting the emissions\nof greenhouse gases, as we enter the 21 st century. Yet the prospects do not look good. The oil\ncompanies have waged a highly effective campaign to block effective political action. The\nindustry is addicted to its enormous profits, and\ncarries on regardless of the devastation it causes to the environment and to people, particularly in the Third World.\nA week ago, a Nigerian dissident named\nOronto Douglas visited Imperial College to give\na talk about the oil industry. He was here to tell\nstudents what they - and Shell Oil in particular -are doing to his country. Oronto is a voice who\nShell and the Nigerian dictatorship would dearly\nlove to silence, as they silenced\nKen Saro-Wiwa before him. That is\nwhy it was important to hear what\nOronto had to say.\nNigeria is ruled by a military\ndictatorship, propped up by the oil\nmoney which forms 90% of its revenue - Shell accounts for nearly a half of this. For 30 years Shell has\nrelentlessly polluted the Niger\nDelta and profited from its rich\nresources at the expense of local\npeople. The tribes of the Delta\nonce lived by farming and fishing.\nThen the oil companies came and\nlaid high-pressure pipelines\nthrough their villages and across\ntheir fields. For fifteen years the\nDelta region suffered an average of\nfour oil spills every week, j Agricultural land is now contaminated and the rivers polluted with\npetroleum and oil. Fish stocks have\nbeen decimated and cholera is rife.\nExploratory and other work has devastated\nmore rainforest, mangrove and wetland habitat,\nthreatening the biodiversity of the Niger Delta.\nShell operations have killed endangered species\nsuch as fishing owls, chimpanzees, manatees\nand pigmy hippos. Unsurprisingly, the company\nhas found itself the target of protest. In January\n1993, 300,000 Ogoni people (one of the many\ntribes of the Niger Delta) rallied against Shell.\nThe company responded with frequent appeals\nto the country's notorious Mobile Police Force\nto stamp out the protests, but was soon forced\nto withdraw from Ogoniland. When General\nAbacha seized power in a coup later that year -annulling the results of recent elections and\nimprisoning the winner Chief Abiola - he set up\na new Internal Security Task Force to carry out\n\"ruthless military operations\" against the Ogoni\nto reinstate \"smooth economic activities\" in the\nregion. The military began a campaign of terror\nagainst the Ogoni., including mutilations,\ngang-rapes and an estimated 1800 murders.\nAt about this time, four Ogoni elders were\nkilled by security agents. Nine other Ogoni lead-ers, including the renowned writer Ken\nSaro-Wiwa, were subsequently arrested and\ncharged with murdering the elders. The Ogoni\nNine were imprisoned and tortured for nine\nmonths before being brought to trial before a kangaroo court in January 1995. They were\nhanged amid international condemnation on\nNovember 10th. Shell claims to have no influence on Nigerian\npolitics. Yet at one point the company sought to\nbribe Saro-Wiwa's brother with an offer to\nrelease Ken if MOSOP (the Movement for the\nSurvival of the Ogoni People) called off its\nprotests and declared that there was no environmental damage in Ogoniland. Moreover,\nWorld fury as Nigeria\nsends writer to gallows\n1|| Ken Saro-Wiwa among nine\n\u2022 . hanged by military junta\nThe Independent front page, 11/11/95\nShell was recently forced to admit that it has\nprovided both logistical and financial support to\nthe Nigerian military, after years of denying this.\nTwenty more Ogoni prisoners await trial\naccused of the same murder charge as Ken\nSaro-Wiwa - 19 have been imprisoned without\ntrial for between 2 and 3 years, in appa ling con-ditions. Yet protests continue in Ogoniland, and\nhave recently spread to other parts of the Niger\nDelta.\nThe same contempt for people and the environment is in evidence wherever the oil companies operate in the Third World. Whether it is BP\nin Columbia, Texaco in Ecuador, total in Burma,\nMobil in Brazil - the details may vary but the\nbasic picture is the same. Previously un contact ed indigenous peoples, who have lived in harmony with their jungle environments for genera-t ions, suddenly find their lands have been taken,\nthe habitats on which they depend for food and\nsustenance are cut down, and their people are\ninfected with diseases against which they have\nno immunity. The population of the Cofan peoples has been reduced from 70,000 to 30,000\nin thirty years. Meanwhile the U 'wa people in\nColumbia are threatening to commit mass suicide rather than allow Shell and Occidental to\nplunder their lands.\nBut even when operating in Western co un tries, the oil industry still causes a litany of\ndestructive environmental impacts at every\nstage of the process. Exploration for oil involves\nseismic testing using vibrations and explosions,\nwhich drive whales from their feeding grounds\nand have been known to kill turtles in the Gulf of\nSuez. Marine extraction involves the release of\n55,000 tonnes of oil into drill cuttings and\nmuds, poisoning sea-bed ecosystems with\narsenic, cadmium and mercury. Oil\nspillages during transport at sea are\na routine occurrence.\nOccasionally these hit the news\nwhen they occur close to environmentally sensitive coastlines. Oil\nrefineries are major sources of air\nand water pollution. The city of\nWhiting in Indiana has a permanent\nlayer of oil floating above its\ngroundwater, thanks to the Amoco\noil refinery there. Yet more problems arise from the disposal of\nredundant oil infrastructure - the\ncase of Shell's Brent Spar oil platform epi tomis ed the industry's lack\nof concern about where it dumps\nits rubbish.\nArguably, the most significant\nenvironmental impacts come from\nconsumption of the industry's core\nproducts - fuel oil and petroleum.\nThis produces a host of pollutant\nemissions, notably the toxic cocktail which spews out of the world's500 million\nexhaust pipes. These cause a range of impacts\non natural and built environments and on\nhuman health. The most worrying pollutant\nemission however is the one which causes no\nimmediate damage whatsoever - carbon dio x ide. Since pre-industrial times, concentrations\nof this greenhouse gas have increased from 280\nto 350 parts per billion. This is almost certainly\nlinked to the rise in average global temperatures\nwhich has taken place over the same period. In\n1990, a United Nations-appointed panel of\n2,500 climate scientists reported that an immediate 60% cut in greenhouse emissions was\nneeded to prevent further global warming. Two\nyears later at the Rio Earth Summit, the world's politicians' responded by setting a target to stabilise emissions at 1990 levels by 2005 - effectively a0% cut in 1 5 years. However, very few\n\n"

    "content": "SPORT 5 December 1997\nSo great it's unbelievable\nICFC Iv Golds I First team captain Chris Soberg\nescaped with a warning following a meeting with a ULU disciplinary\ncommittee, even though the committee stressed that his offence\nagainst UMDS was \"pathetically\ntiny\" rather than \"small\" as reported by Felix last week. Injuries gave\nTony Boyce and Felix Schroeder\ntheir First team debuts, while Jules\nPorreca and Phillip Siverns were\nrecalled, the latter after a28 year\nspell with the Seconds.\nGoldies dominated early on,\nbut failed to create scoring opportunities, and it wasn't surprising\nwhen Warren Brayn crossed for\nBoyce to score on his debut.\nIn the second half Goldsmiths\nequalise d when poor marking gave\nGoldies' a free header from 5 yd s from a corner kick. Goldsmiths\nthen took the lead when confusion\nbetween Psycho and Steve Fleming\nled to Goldies' top scorer scoring\nhis 7th goal against Imperial in 3\nseasons. Brayn made it 2-2 with a clinical finish after he was put\nthrough by Porreca. Brayn then got\nImperial's third with a great strike\nfrom 30 yards. Perhaps not undeservedly Goldies equalise d after\nSiverns had left a huge gap down\nImperial's left hand side.\nICAFC 1 3 - 3 Goldsmiths I ICFC IV v George's II ICWFC v City\nThe herd of buffalo that are the IC\nFourths continued their winning\nrampage up the League, with a dominating performance over the\nMuppets at Cobham.\nWe are now probably the highest placed Fourth-team in the\nwhole of the London University\nFootball, but better still we are\nplaced ahead of IC Thirds in our\nleague. As with the Georgian military coup of 1963 the victors started badly and if Georges could have\nshot as straight as the Soviet army\nthey would have been three goals\nup. As it was, the Fourths fluke da goal against the run of play and let\nGeorges equalise before going on\nto dominate the rest of the game.\nSpeaking words of wisdom,\nAndy Swift superbly marshalled the\ndefence that was also Perez, David\nand Paul, a player who is surely\nplaying the best foot ie of his\ncareer. But as usual the attacking\nplayers will always take the most\ncredit; Darren 'Dazzler' Boland,\n(perhaps back to his best) scored a hat-trick, old bastard Morgan a brace, Serge a Zola-esque free-kick, and both Dave and Perez\nquality goals.\nEven that half-wit with the hat\nplayed OK...\nSt George's II I8 ICAFC IV\nEd's greatest hits\n(and kicks)\nThe ULU karate squad have been\ninvolved in a few scrapes over the\nyear. The first was in the Southern\nRegionals. Around seven rounds\nwere fought before Ed Dos Santos\nqualified - this was gonna be tough.\nThe fight started with both fighters\ntesting one-another reflexively. Ed\nwas acting the aggressor. His\nopponent was having none of it.\nEd launched with a Tobi UrakenUchi flying back fist strike.\nHowever, it was anticipated; the\nattack was blocked and a Gyak\n(reverse punch) was piled to Ed's mid-section. Ed a was a Half-Point\ndown, fight re-started, this time\nwith more movement. Ed faked\nand threw a Reverse punch which\nLanded making it evens. With time\nclocking, the next point would\nsurely win. Fortunately Ed landed a solid backhand blow to the face\nEd took the Southern Regional\nIndividual Male Kumite (Sparring)\nTitle and won the Enoeda award for\nbest fighting spirit that year. In the\nindividuals, Ed had progressed well\nuntil he faced the best karateka\nfrom Cambridge. It was a close call\nbut Donny took it on the day.\nWhen the ULU team went back\nto Chesterfield in an attempt to\nretain the student national title, Ed\nwas looking good. He had to face\nPat, an England KUGB fighter who\nhad beaten him in the open\nnationals in Summer. They knew\neach other and the fight saw a few\nexchanges. After a long and drawn\nout affair, Ed got caught with a blow to the body to send him out.\nIt was cold, wet and miserable, but\nthis did nothing to dampen the\nenthusiasm of 7 IC players who left\nthe shelter of west London to\nbrave the 5 a side team of City uni-vers it y. The game started well,\nwith IC continually taking shots.\nUnfortunately they had a keeper\nwho could actually keep. But with\nper sistance Wee Marissa actually\nput one in. We swapped players at\n1/3 time and feeling confident\nstarted to play again.\nUnfortunately, Vasso of the 5-a side rules conceded a penalty\nwhen she stepped in the circle.\nWith the score at one all the stakes\nwere high, and it was at this\nmoment that the opposition's coach noticed Wee Marissa's superb ball handling skills and set\ntwo men on her. But this did leave\nHacker Lyle free to play off some\nsuperb crosses from Oily and the\nnow bleeding Medic, eventually\nscoring two more goals.\nDuring the 2nd interval Amy\ncomplained about not touching\nthe ball (she was in goal). Despite\nher state of mind, she occasionally\nput down her book long enough to\nsave a penalty. In the final third\nwith encouragement from\nKatherine, both Wee Marisa and\nHacker Lyle scored making it 3 and\na hat-trick for Hacker Lyle.\nAt the end of the evening we\nwere jubilant at having won our\nfirst 5 a side match of the season.\nICWAFC 5 - 3 City university\nICFC II v King's II\nWith the future of King's College\nfootball club in doubt after a \u00a3700\nfine for poaching a ref, IC met the\nKing's seconds in despondent\nmood. With third team ringers Jag,\nJohn and Johnno the seconds were\nby no means assured of victory. As\nthe game began IC looked so good\nit was untrue, but as the half progressed King's became increasingly dominant and it was only superb\ndefending from Loz, Phil The Pill,\nJules and Johnno kept us in the\ngame - allowing Martin's superb\ngoal to separate the teams at half\ntime. Shielding the ball, he turned\nand shot in one motion from the\npenalty spot and curled it into the\ntop corner.\nIn the second half King's fell\napart and we heaped on the humiliation with Jag scoring two on his\ndebut, Jules scoring a fine goal and\nMartin sealing a fine performance\nwith his third goal of the season.\nSpecial praise must be given to\nChris \"Scouse\" Barlow who was\nsuperb in goal as he has been al!\nseason - player of the year so far.\nKing's II 0 5 ICFC II\nlii a shock result tonight, the elite\nof Men's rugby were crushed by\nthe superior drinking prowess of a ladies' hockey ream in a boat race.\nI his result highlights both die v vo e ful abilities of men's rugby an il the\nalcoholic might of ladies' hockey.\nGrandmaster Mestel\nand the Furious Fifty\nHow would you like to take on a world-famous Grandmaster at\nchess? Not really up to that stan-dard? OK, let's even it up a little -we'll give the Grandmaster 50\nopponents at the same time.\nInterested now? On Monday 15\nDecember Dr Jonathan Mestel of\nthe Maths Department will be giving a simultaneous display of his\nchess skills. Dr Mestel is a Grandmaster twice over, having\nreceived the title for \"over the\nboard\" play and for \"problem so lv ing\" - the only person in the world\nto hold two Grandmaster titles.\nGiven the circumstances this is\nprobably the best chance you'll\never get to beat a Grandmaster. If\nyou lose you'll be in good comp a ny, and if you win (or even draw)\nyou'll be a hero!\nThe Challenge will take place in\nLecture Theatre 341 in Huxley\n(Maths), starting at 6.30pm. ALL\nCHESS-PLAYING MEMBERS OF\nTHE COLLEGE ARE INVITED, but\nplaces are limited and priority will\nbe given to students. Light refreshments will be provided for those\ntaking part. Spectators are we l come. To book your place in the\nMestel Challenge, or for further\ninformation about the Chess Club,\nplease contact Bany Gale,\nb.j. gale@ic.ac.uk.\n\n"

    "content": "24\nOUR KID SPEAKS\nCOLUMNS 5 December 1997\nThought for the day\nNo. 7: The fall and rise of Felix\nIf there is such a thing as a regular reader of my self-indulgent\nmusings (Ali Campbell? Isn't he\nthe blok e who was in UB40?) then\nhe or she will undoubtedly be\nrather miffed about the lack of any\ncontribution in last week's Felix. 1\nsecretly suspect that our beloved\nEditor loathed my curry article too\n(it was supposed to be about the\nelections, all right?) but apparently\nhe just ran out of space. (Perhaps\nSimon Baker had been having\nwords...) Naturally he then had to\nbribe me not to reveal the incident\ninvolving the evil malfunctioning\nprinting press, the spade and the\nthree thousand pound repair\ninvoice, which, it must be said, he\nhas kept under a real shroud of\nsecrecy. (At least, nobody has\nmentioned it to Andy Heeps yet).\nMy point, which is rapidly vanishing into the lofty green mists of\ntime, is that, at least as far as I am\nconcerned, Felix has turned the\ncorner. The reason that Jeremy had\nno room for my shite last week is\nthat the contributions are now\ncoming thick and fast. Jon does not\nwander round the office, pale-faced, wondering where his next\nfeature is coming from. (I'm sure\nhe illegally wrote a lot of them him-self, you know.) News meetings no\nlonger consist of two people\nstanding around a depressingly\nwhite whiteboard arguing about\nwhose turn it is to make the tea,\nand deciding whether the article\nabout the broken toilet in\nChemistry should go on the front\npage or not. Last week there were\nmore music reviewers than records\nto review. We once again have a full complement of sub-editors.\nPlus I have not been forced to\nproof read anything for weeks now,\nso some unfortunate sucker must\nhave been found to do that as well.\nJeremy is doing more editing and\nless of everything else, the collating\nis now done by Inky and his team,\nrather than myself and the Editor\non Thursday nights until three in\nthe morning (Rock and roll!), the\nmusic pages have picked up; it's all\ngoing rather nicely. Oh, and\nLiverpool beat Arsenal at the week-end, so the God of the Print Shop,\nAndy \"Inky\" Thompson, is the only\nmiserable bugger in the office.\nI ought to say at this point that\nFelix appreciates all contributions,\nand that if you are interested, just\npop in.

    "content": "ETHICS: Ethics, together with the process of\nknowledge, is one of the most\nimportant philosophical topics\never discussed by the human kind. It is\nmainly about the behaviour of a human\nbeing with respect to another human\nbeing, or inside society.\nSocrates, for instance, said that\nevery man that is provided with a bit of\nrationality cannot do but good things.\nMore recently, Immanuel Kant set the\nbasis of ethics from a non-religious point\nof view saying, for instance, that if a man\nsaved the life of a friend, it would not be\nan ethically-right action. But if that man\nwere to save the life of his worst enemy,\nit would be a perfectly ethical action\nbecause that man recognises the importance of human life above any temporary\ncont in gence. The problem is that philosophers\nsometimes have quite different ideas.\nNiccolo Machiavelli concluded in 1500\nthat morality and ethics are not\n\"absolute\" values but \"relative\" to the\ntemporary situation, and this is particularly true for a king or a head of a nation.\nThat is to say that if we need to kill, say,\n20 terrorists in order to save a whole\ncity, then that will be a perfectly moral\naction.\nNow, we have to remember that\nMachiavelli is considered the founder of\nmodern politics and all nations, including\nthe so-called democratic nations use\npolitical homicide as a means to achieve\ntheir purposes, to ensure the national\nsafety and so on. This is the philosophical basis of many problems of our age.\nWhat we should discuss, in order to\nfind some solutions to these problems,\nis whether ethics has to be considered a \"relative\" science (Machiavelli's opinion)\nor if it has to based on firm principles\nthat cannot be discussed at all (Kant,\nChristian way of thinking). It may be very\ninteresting to go through some examples\nof these different schools of thought and\nto see the possible consequences.\nConsider respect for human life: if\nwe think that ethics has firm principles,\nthen on any occasion we cannot accept\nthe deliberate killing of another man, no\nmatter what the cont in gence. Then, if we\nhad the chance to go back in time and\nkill Hitler, we would be unable to do that\nalthough it would prevent the second\nworld war and millions of deaths.\nIf we think that ethics has a relative\nbasis, we would be able to do this \"sad-but-useful homicide,\" but another huge\nproblem arises. If there are not precise\nethical laws, who decides what is right\nand what is wrong? In this case, we\ncould say that the ethically-right actions\nare the ones that are good for most pe o ple, the ones that cause \"least damage\".\nIn this case, the Americans executed a perfect action when they killed thousands of Japanese by H bombing as their\npurpose was to save as many lives as\npossible by finishing the war in this way.\nWe can easily notice that the same\napproach can be used to discuss other\nproblems,for instance abortion. As long\nas we agree that a human foetus is a( potential) human being, we cannot\naccept abortion if we adhere to Kant's \"Is it ethically\nright to explore\nspace when three\nmen out of five die\nearly because they\ndon't have enough\nfood to keep alive?\"\nschool of thought. According to\nMachiavelli, if we think that the bearing\nof this child will bring so many troubles\nfor him and for other people, (for example because his mother doesn't want\nhim or because he has an illness, that\nwill cause him permanent pain) we can\nabort the birth. In recent years debates\non abortion and the death penalty have\nbecome more violent.\nDuring this century, in both science\nand humanities, we have seen the apology of the relativistic approach to every\nproblem. Einstein stated that that time is\nnot an \"absolute\" entity. Freud investigated the secrets of the human mind\nand discovered how big the influence of\nthe environment on the development of\npersonality is, and how little is the mind\nknows. Still, in 1997, a lot of fundamentalist groups are flourishing, stating that\ntheir ethics and codes of laws are the\nright ones, and according to these statements they feel free to persecute whoever disagrees with them.\nMoreover, is it ethically right to\nspend huge amounts of money on space\nexploration, when on this planet three\nmen out of five are destined to die early\nbecause they don't have enough food to\nstay alive? This is not the case if human\nlife is considered the most important\nvalue, because EVERY SINGLE LIFE is\nunique and after it is finished, it will\nnever repeat. There is nothing to regret if\nwe think that everything is relative and\nevery one of us is lucky with respect to a Third World man, and unlucky with\nrespect to a rich business-man. Then\nwhat are we supposed to do?\nWhat we know for certain is that religious ethics are not a safe-harbour for\nmost of us. Most people are unlikely to\nsteal because it is forbidden by the law\nor because it is a socially reprimand able action, rather than because it is forbidden by religion. Therefore it is TOTALLY\nup to us. If we were a society made of\ngods, a society in which every single\nman is able to choose what is best for\neverybody and not just for himself, then\nlaws wouldn't be necessary. As Socrates\nsaid, if we use a bit of rationality, only\npositive things would exist.\nBut we are here on this planet: 6 billion thinking beings. Men watch the sky\nand ask why they are here. They see a comet and think how similar they are to\nit. A sudden apparition, a wonderful\nshow of bright colours and an equally\nsudden disappearance. But while we\nstay here, we must find the best way to\ninteract with other beings like ourselves.\nWe should try to respect their individuality and at the same time pursue common happiness. When we formulate\nlaws, we have to take into account our\nimperfect and selfish nature, but also our\nnatural right to freedom, since none of\nus were born in chains and none of us\nwere told at birth that we were superior\nto others.\nThe problem remains unsolved now,\nin the same way that it was thousands of\nyears ago. In fact, it will probably remain\nunsolved as long as those imperfect\ncreatures called men are part of this uni-verse.\nMafreo Floris\n\n"

    "content": "NEWS 5 December 1997\nBUSA controversy\nJEREMY THOMSON\nImperial College Union Council is\nlikely to have its most lively\nmeeting this year when it convenes on Tuesday.\nThe controversy has arisen over\nentries to BUSA (the British\nUniversities Sports Association),\nthe backbone of inter-university\nsports competition. In recent\nyears, St Mary's Medical School\nhas registered seperate ly from\nImperial College, but this is now in\ndebate. Eric Allsop (ex-president of\n1CU) and Katie Armstrong\n(President of ICSMU) have submitted conflicting motions to council,\nwith Mr Allsop recommending a move to single entry and the medical officer hoping to field a seperate ICSM team.\nCaptains of all sports teams\nhave been requested to attend and\na large delegation is expected from\nthe medical campuses. Due to the\nexpected size of the meeting and\nthe strength of opinions involved,\nICU is considering drafting in extra\nstewards to maintain order.\nFelix has also heard that the\nnew president of the Royal College\nof Science Union, Helen-Louise\nWindsor, will be tabling a motion to\nforbid smoking during the meeting.\nThe meeting will be held at\n6pm in the Union Dining Hall and is\nopen to all students.\nChemistry Meltdown\nfrom front page\ninadequate maintenance, but the\nstatus of talks is being kept confidential. A number of subsequent surveys have been carried out on the\nwhole electrical system of Chem 2,\nin order to reaffirm safety levels\nthat were previously taken for\ngranted. Thermal imaging has\nbeen employed to identify any\nhotspots within the system, as they\nsignify dangerously high levels of\ncurrent. The unofficial conclusion\nof this analysis gives the building a clean bill of health.\nMaintenance manager, Chas\nGuirey explained how arrangements are being made to have a full visual inspection of the system\nin the near future. This will involve\nisolating each floor and manually\nsurveying all electrical routes. This\npractice usually takes place every\nsix years, but has been moved forward by two years in order to\nensure high standards of safety; it\nis presumed there will be no faults\nfound as a result of this inspection.\nNews in Brief\nSOUTHSIDE\nBRAWL\nA fight which broke out in\nSouthside bar on Friday 21st has\nled to the bar management\nenforcing their rules on not allowing any outside members into the\nbar.\nThe events of the night started\nwhen the bar opened at 5pm with\nfive or six men were waiting at the\nbar. The men were approached by\nGareth Parry, Senior Barman, who\nsuspected that they were outside\ncontractors. They replied saying\nthat they were Imperial College\nGardeners, and were taken on\ntheir word when they failed to\nproduce identification. Mr Parry\nwas warned later that night by a drinker in the bar that the men\nwere starting to get loud, who\ndecided it best not to approach\nthem at the time. The next time\nthat Mr Parry's attention was\ndrawn was when one of the students in the bar came out from\naround the pool table bleeding\nheavily as a result of a split nose,\naccording to Mr Parry, after being\nhead butted by one of the men.\nThe bar staff then proceeded to\neject the party from the bar. The\nstudent then went to the toilet\nwith one of the bar staff and\nreturned apparently OK, although\nhe was taken to hospital by his\nworried friends.\nAlthough the incident was isolated Mr Parry has advised all his\nstaff that no contractors are\nallowed on the premises. The incident is still under investigation by\ncollege security, but is being hindered by a veil of silence that has\nfallen over the incident, and also\nthe fact that the identity of the\nparty has not been established.\nELECTRONIC\nLOCKS LEAVE\nROOMS INSECURE\nIt has emerged that a few of the\nnew locks which were recently fitted in Beit Hall could be opened\nusing an Imperial College Union\ncard.\nThe new system uses cards\nthat contain electronic information which then opens the lock,\nbut due to bad fitting and the\ndesign of the locks and frames it\nwas possible to open the locks by\nsliding a flexible card between the\ndoor and frame and forcing the\nlock to open. The fault was first\ndiscovered by one of the residents and was reported to the\nwardens who acted quickly to\nresolve the problem. All the locks\nhave now been checked and the\nfaults have been repaired.\nThe locks were put in to\nincrease the security of the rooms\nas any lost keys would not result\nin the re-fitting of a new lock but\nsimply reprogramming it.\nWorld AIDS day was marked on Monday 1st by a now traditional red\nribbon mounted on the front of the union building. The day featured\ninfomation stalls and the sale of red ribbons. Photo: Ivan Chan\nWanted\nUniversity News Researcher\nCorrespondent needed to investigate news stories at other uni-vers i ties. You would be expected\nto read student newspapers,\nboth in print and on the web and\nregularly contact the editors of\nkey publications, and check the\nnational press.\nYou would also need to attend\nthe news meetings (12.30pm Fridays and 2pm Tuesdays).\nIf you are interested, please contact the Felix office on (0171\n59)48072 or felix@ic.ac.uk, or\ncome and see us in the office.\nWanted\nWorld News Researcher\nEnthusiastic writer needed for a new section. The job, which\nwould take around five hours per\nweek, will involve researching\ninternationl press for the week\n(written and world wide web) for\nstories of interest to students.\nThe stories can then be prepared\nyourself or passed on to the\nnews team for production.\nIf you are interested, please contact the Felix office on (0171\n59)48072 or felix@ic.ac.uk, or\ncome and see us in the office.\n\n"

Due to lighting conditions scores were generally lower than anticipated but again\nEd proved equal to the task.

Indeed, this charming team has succeded in breaking\nan ankle, our captain's nose, and\n(well, nearly) our goddess shooter\nPat D.'s finger. Treacherous villa ny are the words.\nNevertheless, spirits remain\nhigh. As it stands, the team is currently top of the League, and has\nan excellent chance of reaching the\ntop 32 in BUSA.\nClaire D.'s shots deserve a special mention, together with\nSandrine B.'s offensive efforts during Friday's match against\nGoldsmiths. We look forward to\nmore stunning performances from\nour female basketball ers. Downhill All the Way\nfor IC Skiers\nHUSKI'S SERIES\nThe first race of the Huski's series was held on Sunday\nevening in Welwyn Garden-City.\nDespite being short of racers\n(due to multiple injuries in the first\nrace) we managed to enter a team\ncomprising of Alex Clerdel, Alex\nWright, David Wahl, Caitlin Wroe\nand Izabelle Kaminska.\nThe race consisted of two\ntimed individual runs dow a slalom\ncourse followed by a head to head\ndual slalom race. There were some\ngood performances all round,\nespecially considering that two\nmembers had never raced before.\nCaitlin won the Ladies slalom.\nIn the team dual slalom, we\nhad rather an unlucky draw against\nthe \"plastic playthings\" (who's team consists mainly of ex-England team members) in our first\nrace so we were knocked out\ninstantly. Despite this we gave a brave performance and didn't lose\nby too much of a margin!\nSOMETHING ELSE?\nFor the first, and probably the\nlast time this season, Imperial\nmanaged to remain unbeaten all\nevening. Despite winning all of\nour races we somehow only managed to finish in 15th place over-all. How is this possible? We may\nbe great skiers, but sadly our orienteering skills are somewhat\nlacking. Both cars managed to\nget lost, and as a result we\nmissed the first round of races.\nAfter sweet-talking the judges\nwe were allowed to enter a single\nteam in the remaining rounds.\nWith only a few practise runs\nbefore the second round of racing,\nwe easily managed to crush our\ninferior opponents in the four\nremaining races.\nDespite missing half of the\nraces, we finished a respectable\n15th, with some awesome displays of skiing, most notable from\nCaitlin racing against her older\nbrother.\nRugby\nThe Imperial Medicals 1st&.2 nd XVs have finished with unbeaten\nrecords at the top of their respective BUSA league groups, securing\npromotion into the Southern\nPremier league, where they will\nhope to compete on a level footing\nwith the likes of Brunei, Exeter &.\nBristol. The I st XV took their group\nby storm as opposition teams\nstruggled to contain a pack that\nwas both powerful and mobile and\nthe backs were allowed to display\nsome breathtaking running and\nhandling skills in attack, scoring a massive total of 401 points in the\nseven games. Fierce tackling in\ndefence meant that the team only\nconceded 53 points in total in the\nleague.\nThe road to the top of the\nleague was marginally harder for\nthe 2nd XV and the final game of\nthe league saw them facing\nPortsmouth in a game they had to\nwin. With 10 minutes remaining,\nthe score line read 29-20 in the\noppositions favour. However, the\nunyielding spirit of the medics created a breathtaking finish to the\nmatch and a try in the corner on\nthe stroke of full time sealed the\nnarrowest of wins and snatched\nthe league away from the grasp of\na dispirited Portsmouth side.\nHockey\nHolloway Iy ICHC I The firsts set out with an air of\nexpectancy after their Godlike triumph in the group stages (P6 W5\nDl L0). On a grey day at a pitch\nbest described as crap, we battled\nout a hard fought contest on a frozen afternoon.\nAfter an under served goal from\nan under served short corner, we\npiled on the pressure to equalize\nthrough top scorer and God-like\ncaptain Chicken-Bol.

But the confusion surrounding the scientific evidence\nprobably does merit a few words.\nWe know with certainty that our rate\nof greenhouse emissions far exceeds\nwhat our planet can absorb.\nAtmospheric greenhouse concentrations and hence global temperatures\nare therefore bound to rise - indeed,\nthey would continue to do so for another 60\nyears even if we made that 60% cut tomorrow.\nAnd it is now pretty clearly established that\nman-made global warming has already started;\nthe IPCC recently stated that \"the balance of\nevidence suggests a discern able human influence on global climate.\"\nWhat we do not know for certain is how\nmuch or how quickly temperatures would rise in\nresponse to a given level of greenhouse emissions; nor what the effects these temperature\nrises would have on our climate systems.\nHowever, the best estimates from the IPCC and\nothers predict average rises of 1.5 - 4.5 C if we\ncontinue with \"business as usual\". This would\nincrease the incidence of extreme weather\nevents; ecosystems would collapse under the\npace of change; tropical diseases would spread\nto traditionally cooler climates; millions would\nbe displaced as environmental refugees due to\nUnwanted gas from oil wells is 'flared', resulting in respiratory difficulties for\nlocals and contributing to global warming.\nfamine, flooding and other disasters; wars over\nwater would replace wars over oil.\nThe irony is that, as sea levels start to rise,\nthe countries which have profited from causing\nthe problem will be able to afford flood\ndefences etc, whilst third world societies who\nstill lead low-impact lifestyles will be least able\nto fend for themselves.\nSo what does the rector of Imperial College\nhave to do with all this? Imperial College probably has closer links with the oil industry than any\nother higher education establishment in Great\nThe Rector of IC, Sir Ronald Oxburgh,\nis a non-executive director of Shell\nTransport and Trading.\nBritain.\n\u2022 IC is believed to carry out more than twice\nas many research projects for the oil industry as any other college;\n\u2022 IC provides more recruits for the oil industry\nthan any other college in Britain apart from\nAberdeen and Robert Gordon Universitiesboth local to the North Sea oil fields;\n\u2022 The Rector of IC, Sir Ronald Oxburgh, is a non-executive director of Shell Transport\nand Trading.\nSo when Oronto Douglas spoke to us last\nweek, he was in effect telling us what our\nRector's company is doing to his country.\nOil is an inherently destructive business. By\naccepting oil money, we as students become\npart of the problem. Our education and\nresearch is no longer a pure, value-free quest\nfor knowledge. It is about serving the needs of\nan industry whose core activity involves claiming\nownership of a substance which has\nresided inside our\nplanet for millions of\nmillennia, extracting\nit, turning it into\nmoney and releasing it as pollution.\nSelling the free\ngoods of the earth is\nbound to be enormously lucrative.\nAnd the lure of\npetro-dollars drives\npeople to kill.\nWe should be\nresearching the\nalternatives - wind,\nwave, biomass and\nparticularly solar\nenergy. Some will\nargue that renewables will never be\nable to meet the growing\ndemand from developing\ncountries if they are to\nachieve their legitimate aspirations to western standards of living. All the\nmore reason to devote further research into\nmethods of energy conservation, and on economic activities which are less demanding on\nenergy.\nThe oil companies are exploiting the financial dependence of educational establishments\nresulting from the funding gap left by central\ngovernment. Yet if Imperial College is to get out\nof its Faustian contract with the oil industry, we\nwill undoubtedly need to ask how to replace the\nfunding - just as many sporting bodies are having to do in the absence of tobacco\nsponsorship. There are several possible answers. We should use our\ninfluence with the oil companies to\npersuade them that there is no future\nin ever-increasing oil consumption,\nneither for them as businesses, nor\nfor life on earth as we know it. We\ncan make it clear that we will have no\npart in their plans for continued\ngrowth into the 21 st century; we can point out\nthat future graduates will no longer be attracted\nto work for companies whose reputation is\nrapidly sinking to that of the once prestigious\nnuclear industry. On a more positive note, we\ncould offer our expertise in helping them to\nresearch the renewable energy sources which\nhave got to turn to in the future.\nBut continuing with the status quo is not an\noption. It is sometimes claimed that an oil-free\nfuture is \"unrealistic\"; the opposite is in fact the\ncase. Continuing oil-exploitation is not only\nimmoral from the point of view of the Third\nWorld; it is also an environmental impossibility.\nThe future lies in a different direction, and we\nmust choose it however much it may cost us in\nthe short term.\n\n"

If you haven't heard of him before, you're\neither pre-teen, foreign, or were\nliving in some back-water village as\nEverything I Do... blasted record\nbooks left, right and centre. So, you\nwill no doubt already have your\nown views as to his pros and cons.\nThe question is whether or not this\nalbum is going to change any op in ions.\nThis is an 'Unplugged' and generally this means an acoustic 'best\nof, but this is debatable. The name\nBryan Adams goes hand in hand\nwith songs like Run to You and the\naforementioned Everything I Do...,\nbut unfortunately neither of these\nmade it into the Unplugged ses-sion. However, Summer of '69 did\nmake it in, and what a rendition it\nwas. Then things start becoming a little strange. Following rousing\nperformances of I'm Ready, Cuts\nLike a Knife, and Back to You,\ncomes 18 Til I Die - but this one's dead on arrival. Over fan c if i ed by\nmore strings than you can shake a stick at, it really wasn't written with\nviolins and cellos in mind. Then,\nthings get stranger still; Bryan\nAdams - country &. western musician extra ordinaire. What he's doing with / Think About You does-n't bear thinking about.\nThe characteristic guitar wielding Adams does come back for the\nfinal act, which includes the classic\nballad Heaven.\nAdams knows his fan base is\npretty much carved in stone and\nwith this he only seems to want to\nsteal a few Michael Bolton follow-ers. If you like Bryan Adams, you'll\nlike this. If you're undecided,\nremember that this is really a 'best\nof that doesn't contain all of his\nbest. CI\nDerek\nADEVA\nNew Direction * *\nA deva, the queen bee diva is\nback in town ready to sting a few souls with her latest\nalbum New Direction. She first\nappeared on the charts with her\nsoulful presence with her single\nRespect and followed that up with\nher debut album Adeva which gave\nher platinum status in the U.K. That\nis all very interesting but what does\nher album sound like?\nNew Direction starts with the\nfeel good factor of some commercial house tunes. There are a few\nbopp in', movin',g roo v in' tracks\nbut overall they all sound similar\nand lack musical variety. The whole\ntempo of the album then hits the\nbrakes and switches on to the Soul\nTrain sounds with the funky track\nDon't Think About It. This is a groovy laid back chilled track produced by the UK soul stars, DInfluence whose musical skills\nwe're definitely feelin'. 1 was pleasantly surprised by this number but\nthere was more to come with\nFriday Night, Saturday Mourning\nanother tune to look out for. This is\njoint hip hop effort produced by\nKarl Gordon who comes out with a wicked boom ba stic classic track\nsounding similar to the sounds of\nYvette Michelle and Funk Master\nFlex. This definitely boosts the\nrespectability of this album, showing how impressive Adeva's voice\nis with an R'n Bf lava. The album\ndisappointingly finishes with yet\nanother deflated garage tune, Nu\nBirth remix of Don't Think About It,\nlack in' severe inspiration. Adeva\nhas got some appealing, funky\nsounds which are just raped by the\nmajority of howling house tunes on\nthis album. Looks like Queen Bee\nAdeva has just stung herself!

Hope everyone feels good.\nIts that time of the week again, that Friday\nfeeling. (A quick shout out to all the West\nCoast G's and now back to the column.) Last\nweek I was feeling lazy and so you only got my\ntop ten, this time round normal service has\nbeen resumed and you get the old style back\nand in full effect.\nGoing straight in to the news and happen-in gs.I got some news that is gonna break\nsome boys' hearts, the big bad mama Foxy\nBrown is officially engaged to be married to\nDogg Pound member Kurupt. Foxy is currently touring stateside with The Firm as part of\nthe Bad Boy tour, while Kurupt is in the stu-dio, his last project was over seeing the highly successful Gang Related Soundtrack, which\nby the way is tha bomb. Just released on the\nbig screen is 'Nothing To Lose' staring Martin\nLawrence & Tim Robins from what I been told\nthis is funny but ain't nothing to write home\nabout. In addition we also have 'Def jams\nHow To Be A Player' staring Bill Belllamy, this\nis pure crap, Bill Bellamy can't act for shit so\nsave ya money and wait for the release of\n'Soul Food', which is meant to be blow those\ntwo out of the water.\nBack to the music and released this week\nis the new Salt'N 'Pepa album Brand New.\nThere's been a gap of about two/three years\nsince their last album Very Necessary and\nthey have picked up where they left of, this LP\nis full of some first class stuff, and will\nundoubtedly spawn many successful singles.\nNext up is compilation tribute album In Tha\nBeginning, the album is described as a tribute\nto rap and is made up of covers of old rap\nclassics. Featuring the likes of The Wu-Tang\nClan, Snoop, Puffy, Cypress Hill, Bone Thugs,\nand more, just looking at the line up this is\nsure to be a success on some level. For all the\nsoul men (and ladies) the essential buy for\nthis week is the new Babyface joint, entitled\nFace Unplugged, just as it sounds this is the\nMTV unplugged gig he did in September. For\nthose who don't know Babyface is Mr Soul\nhimself, he has written for nearly every major\nsoul/R& JS artist, and it was he who penned\nthe Boyz II Men hit 'I 'll Make Love To You',\nwhich stayed at number one in the US for a record 17 weeks. On this Mister Babyface\ngets together with his friends and does the\nacoustic thing on all of his own classics and\nthe classics he wrote. This is a must.\nTime to move into singles territory. First\nup we got those Motown men, Boyz II Men,\nwith A Song For Mama this is just as you\nwould expect, the boys are masters on the\nvocals and the production is tight, but this\nwouldn't be my choice for the second single.\nIt's lifted from their album Evolution and for\nthose trains potters it was also showcased on\nthe Soul Food Soundtrack. Dru Hill release\ntheir third single 5 Steps; now I don't like Dru\nHill and I don't like this, but I would advise\nbuying it for the So So Def mix of In My Bed,\nthis was a monster over tha summer. Busta\nfollows up the successful Put Your Hands....\nwith a favourite of mine Dangerous. Some\npeople been telling me that Busta has lost his\nraw energy, but you know what I don't give a fuck tha boy got it and'When Disaster Strikes\nis a must have. BLACKstreet still doin' it,\nthese boys are tha definition of tha bomb,\nvocals are of the highest class, the production\nis out of this world, for me they're the greatest R&B band in the world at the minute.\nTheir first album was a classic; this second\none has brought them more mainstream success and is rated as one of the best albums of\nthe year. As we draw to the close of the year\nthey have release of their cover of the Bealtes\nclassic Money Can't Buy Me Love, this ain't bad and should do well in the charts, especially now at Christmas.\nIts the 5th December, only twenty days till\nChristmas Day and only two weeks of term\nleft, nice! That's me finished, see you around,\nMilen\n\n"

    "content": "5 December 1997\nTRASH, BASICALLY\nTHE BLACK BOOK\nBOOKS 21\nSara Keays\nI was bitterly disappointed by\nthis book. Instead of the sizzling bon k buster about a beautiful female Parliamentary secretary\nwho gets seduced by the evil politician on-the-rise, culminating in his\nsacking from the Cabinet, and\nreneging on a promise to marry her\neven though she is pregnant with\nhis child, it's a rather tame thriller\nabout a book containing scandalous stories about the dealings of\nMPs and the impact that these stories might have on the country. In\nview of Ms Keays being the former\nmistress of the now Lord\nParkinson, I was expecting far, far\nmore than this. According to the\nElectronic Telegraph, many\nConservative MPs were to read the\nbook avidly in fear of recognising\nthemselves. Ms Keays's novel,\nwhich she has said is based on her\n\"life and times\", avoids parallels\nwith her affair, which is a shame,\nsince all the scandals under this\ngovernment have been very dull,\nand probably hushed up by the\nspin doctors. The book paints a picture of\ncorrupt and hypocritical MPs\nwhose mis demean ours are noted\nin a \"Black Book\" guarded by the\nChief Whip, Harry Hunter. Jo, a beautiful, tall, slender widow, with\npensive blue eyes, and a thoughtful\nmouth, the usual type of high powered secretary, is temporarily working for this unpleasant, adulterous\nman, whilst his permanent secretary is on sick leave. She is asked\nby his wife to visit his London Flat,\nand whilst there, finds the \"Black\nBook\", and is scandal is ed by what\nshe reads. In doing this, she's spotted by a member of the CIA,\nwho is watching the flat, apparently as a matter of routine. I'd like to\nsay that about five car chases and\nsix reverberating scandals later, she\nis gunned down by the combined\nforces of the British and American\nsecret services, but sadly, she isn't. Instead, she hides the book, and\ninvestigates. The ruling party, which\nis assumed to be the Tories, tries to\ndiscredit her allegations as the\n\"fantastic al ravings of a deranged\nfemale\"; none the less she succeeds in jailing several MPs and\nbringing down the Government.\nJo, a woman of principles, is\ndisillusioned to discover the\nHouses of Parliament, and in particular the Commons, to be an\ninstitution full of \"oddballs and mis-fits\", many of them \"arrogant little\nshits\". This will not come as much\nof a surprise to anyone who has\never read a newspaper or watched\nthe news. Most are \"much more\ninterested in fame than sex\" and\nwould prefer to be \"on television\nthan in bed with a gorgeous girl\".\nHowever, I'm sure Messieurs\nMerchant, Yeo, Parkinson, Mellor,\nSpring, who allegedly prefers three-in-a bed, Booth and Hughes, all of\nwhom became famous due to their\nhabit of going to bed with gorgeous\ngirls, would disagree with that\nstatement. She is also horrified to\nlearn that many MPs are \"too busy\nearning fat fees from outside inter-est s\" to do their own work or to listen to their constituents. I could\nreel off another list of corrupt and\nhypocritical MPs, but I feel that\ntheir names are already far, far too\nfamiliar to most of us. The book is\nfull of praise for Commons secretaries, hmm, I wonder why, who\nare treated \"like battery hens\"\nwhilst practically giving blood \"for\nsome ambitious creep who takes\nyou for granted and gets all the\ncredit\". Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned\nIn a way, I liked this book even\nthough it is not at all as exciting as\nit could have been. It's interesting\nenough to read on a tube or bus, or\nif you really have nothing better to\ndo. It strikes me as a bit of a revenge fantasy, and maybe Ms\nKeays would like to have seen the\nentire Conservative party discredited by her actions, as opposed to by\ntheir own. It's not as irritatingly\nun put down able as the last book I reviewed, in fact I really can't remember any point of distinction\nin it at all.

    "content": "18 MUSIC 5 December 1997\nCLUBSCENE\nAbout three weeks ago, I accepted an invitation to travel out to Munich in Southern\nGermany and take part in an experimental\nradio show called Brainput. 1 decided to stay\nin MjrtBjTWr11\n' a^'^ jj ltr i lrt y f jar it was< u in o%J lup#e\" n^sW miSt l# pai#\n\u2022 :\n\\\n. \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n. . \":\n\u2022 I This,:j^|j Qi J \u00bbI^S| M^^ jJ^|j l^^p: a boi it some of the electronic music that you can\nfind coming out of this region. Munich is a small, compact city and its scene is often\nreferred to as \"the family\". This has nothing\nto do with the mafia, but is an affectionate\nway of describing the closeness between the\ndifferent branches of music. Everyone seems\nto support everyone else and homegrown talent is valued and nurtured.\nFrom relative obscurity, Munich has grown\nto a major force in European electronic\nmusic; gaining respect from the international\ntechno community. For all its presence, only a handful of underground labels arc prod wta jp music out of the city. Each label has such a varied and diverse sound that you feel the\nwhole electronic spectrum is represented.\nDisko B has been putting out '\nnearly as long as there was techno. Early\nreleases on the label were all cutting-edge\nhard club techno. Artists such as Dj Hell\nmade sure that Disko B would always be\nremembered as one of the top International\nlabels. As one of the world's leading techno\nD|s he was also crucial in spreading the Diskou\nB sound on a global scale. Musical highlights\nfrom his career include the album Geteert\nund Gefedert and the an the mic Jeff Mills\nremix of Allersehen.\nDisko B cannot be accused of staying with\nits winning club-techno formula in order to\nplay it safe and sell more records. The philosophy behind the label is not merely to move\nwith tr \" \u2022\n. .vS- fAn i A A i^ i.f AAvC,.:,\n;\"'!J:.,, \u00bbv>.;i;., f.i Brokesch {Sharing the Sunhat LP), an artist\nwho twists and cu^K^r% g^f ois* ant( melodies\nto create different\nPlatzgumer is another in-house artist (Der\nSeparator LP) who is playing with snippets of\nelectro, trip-hop, jazz and pop and creating a unique, experimental sound.\nWith new releases from established US\nartists such as Gemini, Blake Baxter and a well-anticipated forthcoming release from\nKiriian (aka Abe Duque; Pleasure Yourself LP),\nthis a label not to be ignored.\nof re ce..

If you are interested in a variety of jazzed-up, funky sounds with\nemphasis on the word eclectic then do check\nout the Future Sound of Jazz compilation\nalbums.

Man.\nL ast week on the Electric Cafe\nSpencer Kinsey (aka Gemini)\nrevealed his desire to have\nthe freedom to reach as many people as possible with his music. He\nclaimed that five years with Relief\nRecords became claustrophobic\nand perhaps hindered his ability to\ndo this. So what did he do to put\nhimself back on track? He recorded\nthree albums and released them all\nwithin three months of each other!\nAll three are in the typically quirky\nbut catchy house/techno style of\nGemini, but each captures a different period and mood in his career.\nFollowing the heavy, frustrated\nsounds of Imagine a Nation (Relief)\nand the freer melodies of In and\nOut of Fog and Lights (Peacefrog),\nIn Neutral is the third in the series.\nIt deals with the theme of relaxation and introspection as a means\nof finding the energy and motives\nto move forward once more.\nWe begin with Campanula and\nLifted Life both of which are a subtle blend of house rhythms and\njazzy melodies. Although not the\nbest tracks by far, they provide a solid start and an indication of\ngreat things to come.\nGreat things come very soon.\nMemory is the work of a vivid\nimagination. Waves of sound wash\nover a punchy beat and as this\ntrack unfolds, stories are told and\nscene ries painted. The effect is\nawesome; when the volume is low\nthis is ideal listening music, but it\nalso makes for good dancefloor\nmaterial.\nGemini expounds his philosophies and creates a very quirky\ntrack with On This Planet. It is\nunique to the Gemini sound; more\nexperimental than house, less\nabrasive and slower than techno.\nAhi has a very trip py, happy-go-lucky rhythm section, and is a fresh change to some of the more\ncontemplative tracks on offer. This\nis definitely for relaxation.\nThe disappointment of this\nalbum is the down tempo, disco-influenced title track In Neutral.\nThis would probably sound good if\nit was not on this album, but\ninstead on another EP. Personally I don't think it fits into the In Neutral\nproject, sounding too separate\nfrom the other tracks on offer.\nHowever this is quickly forgotten with the next track, ?. This\npiece plays with rhythm, shuffling\nand clicking its way through. It is an\nexample of how to be experimental\nand not cut off the mass of your\naudience.\nGemini has created what he set\nout to achieve in his own subtle\nway. The emphasis is on how it\nshould be listened to rather than\nwhere it should be played in aD] set. The end result is an album that\nbegs the attention of your\nears...and your mind! rTl cl al;ck\n\n"

    "content": "5 December 1997\nFICTION\nFICTION 27\nI 've Got Today by Caspar von Wrede\nThe three figures stepped into the\nnight and were immediately enveloped by\nthe bitter cold. As the icy air washed over\ntheir faces the warmth of the dimly lit\nrestaurant had already become nothing\nbut a distant memory. A neon sign above\nthem flickered sporadically and briefly\nilluminated the flurries and confusions of\nmyriad snowflakes that endlessly fell\nfrom an inky sky. The smallest of the\nthree figures gave an exclamation of\nchildish glee at the sight of the newly fallen snow, whilst the remaining two stood\nhand in hand. With the child running\nahead, and the parents following, they\nbegan carefully making their way over the\nglittering layer of white, which crunched\nsoftly under the soles of their feet.\nThe young mother snuggled up close to\nher husband for she could already feel the\ndarkness sapping her warmth through the\nthin overcoat.\n\"Carol, stay with us\", she\ncalled to her four year-old daughter whom\nthe snow-specked darkness was threatening\nto swallow. Her voice was weak.\n\"How bad is it today?\" the young man\nasked his wife quietly, in case the child\nheard him.\n\"It has been worse\", she coughed fee-bly, and hoped in vain that he had not heard\nthe wince of pain that followed. \"But I think\nI 'll need those stronger pills\". The man\nsqueezed his wife's waist with the one arm\nhe had laid around her.\n\"Of course. Honey, we'll pop down to\nthe hospital first thing tomorrow.'' He tried\nto sound casual but in reality it seemed a cord had tightened around his heart. He\nknew that his wife was suffering excruciating pain and that her death loomed ever\ncloser. They both realised the futility of the\nmedications she was taking at the moment\nbut they were prepared to try anything that\nwould inspire hope. The list of cures, that\nhad been tried and failed, had grown longer\never since the cancer was diagnosed, shortly after their marriage. Now the\ndisease had been pronounced terminal and\nthey both found it very difficult to come to\nterms with the fact that, in the near future,\nthey would be separated forever.\n\"We'll try and get home soon; it must\nbe the cold that's making it so bad\". His\nbreath hung in the air like the lie he had just\ntold.\nThe young girl with her inexhaustible\nsupply of youthful energy, was busy making\nsnowballs. She was not aware of her par-ents' apprehensions, nor of the cold that\nwould soon begin to bite. Her face was\nalight with her glowing vitality whilst the\nsnow frosted her white blonde hair.\n\"Daddy, where is the car? Are we going\nhome soon?\"\n\"Yes, my sweet, the car park is just\nbeyond that road\". The carefree voice of his\ndaughter had, as always, dispersed the\ngloom that had settled on the young man's soul.\nThe three of them came to some broad\nstone steps that led into an empty square.\nA deserted road junction was just visible\nthrough the darkness and falling snow\nbeyond the square. A rank of sodium arc\nlamps stretched into the gloom along with\nthe empty roads. Their lights, high above\nthe ground, glowed diffusely and were surrounded by a halo of falling snow. They\ncaused the whole scene to be bathed in a supernatural orange light.\nIt is so silent, thought the man, as he\nhelped first his wife and then his daughter\ndown the treacherous steps. Not a breath\nof the icy cold air stirred, whilst the featureless expanse of orange-tinged snow\nstretched away before them. It almost looks\nlike a vast stage, he thought, I wonder what\nscenes will be acted out upon it tonight.\nThe trio trudged silently\nacross the seamless blanket of snow\ntowards the deserted junction, where a single traffic light glimmered forlornly. The\nsnow had settled on the lanes of tarmac\nand it was obvious that no snow plough or\ngrit spreader would clear this road tonight.\nAs they reached the curb, the young\nwoman was suddenly racked by a coughing\nfit and doubled over. The young man knelt\nbefore her and anxiously peered into her\nface which was contorted with pain\n\"Julie? Are you all right?\"\nNeither of them could see that the\nyoung child had stepped over the curb and\nwas crossing the road.\n\"Yes, it's Okay, I just need to rest\"\nFor a brief second a car's headlights\nswept through the snow far ahead of them.\nThe man looked up In their direction and\nthey reappeared, two malevolent eyes cutting swathes into the driving snow.\nSoundlessly the lights glided towards him\nand his wife who was kneeling in the snow.\nFor a fraction of a second he had the illusion that the car would hit them\nbut then he saw it would pass harmlessly by\non the road. Then his eyes fell onto his\ndaughter who was still crossing the road\nand the adrenaline erupted hotly into his\nblood.\n\"JESUS CHRIST! CAROL! GET OFF THE\nROAD! CA-\"\nThe car was coming too fast, the child\nwas too far away. He stood transfixed, his\nlast words caught in his throat. It seemed to\nhim that the sands of time had slowed to a trickle. The car came on with an unerring\nslowness, yet his limbs locked solid as he\ntried to leap forward. The blood was\npounding in his temples. He knew that what\nwas unfolding in front of him now was being\nburned indelibly into his memory, to haunt\nhim in his nightmares and every waking\nhour for years to come. He tried to shut his\neyes but was not surprised to find that\nnothing happened. The picture before him\nremained crisp and almost unnaturally\nsharp. He could see everything down to the\ntiniest detail. He saw that one of his da ugh ter's shoelaces was undone and that she\nhad a small pink plaster on her little finger.\nHe saw the individual snowflakes as they hit\nthe car's windscreen and exploded into tiny\ndrops of moisture.\nThe car had slowed to a inexorable,\nmaddening crawl. It seemed to him it\nwould stop before it ever reached the child,\nyet he knew it to be untrue. His imagination\nraced and already he could see and hear\nwhat was about to happen next. In his mind\nhe saw the car's wet bumper touch his\ndaughter's leg and crumple the thin\ntrousers that covered it. He imagined the\ncold steel on the child's thigh and the soft\nsnaps as the delicate bones fractured. He\nsaw the girl's foot begin to drag in the snow\nas the car advanced steadily further. He\nheard the soft thud as the radiator grille\nbutted into her torso. He could perfectly\nimagine the tiny rib cage dent and expel the\nlast, warm breath from his daughter's mouth. He imagined the tiny heart crushed,\ncaught in mid beat, desecrated. He could\nsee the small head, with its wispy curls,\nwhiplash onto the bonnet and crack. He\nimagined the blood burst forth, and fan out\nin the slip stream. He heard the patter of a million droplets and saw the crimson\nsmear, dark on the snow.\nThen, mercifully, his mind blanked,\noverloaded with the grotesque images that\ncrammed into it. There was a blissful second of blackness, a mental vacuum, and\nthen for the first time he heard the car. It\nexploded into his brain, a mechanical roar,\nthe scream of thumping pistons, the whistle of hot exhaust and the muted concussions deep inside the engine block. His\nlungs were suddenly filled with dense,\nfumes and he choked and vomited into the\nsnow.\nAn eternity later his wife sharply hitched\nin breath beside him. Now she will scream,\nthought the man as he slowly opened his\neyes. The first thing he saw was the car that\nhad wildly slewed into the junction. His wife\ndid not scream, however, she only sobbed\nonce, heart-wrench ingly, and then she\nstood up and ran into the road.\nFor there stood the girl, untouched. The\nmother gathered her into her shaking arms\nand held her close. She felt the warmth that\nthe child radiated and the vitality that\ncoursed through its body.\nAs she stood in the sifting snow, inches\nfrom the fresh tyre tracks and feeling the\ninextinguishable life that pulsed in her arms,\nthe young woman felt, for the first time in\nyears, hope.\n\n"

Ultimately,\nthough, it is the motion that is\ntabled first that stands the most\nchance of success, as a decision on\nthe first motion renders the second\nobsolete.

    "content": "5 December 1997 FILM 25\nStarring: Pierce Brosnan, Jonathan Pryce, Michelle Yeoh, Teri Hatcher\nDirector: Roger Spottiswoode\nBeautiful women, car chases\nthrough crowded back\nstreets, a crazy villain\nintent on world domination and\nspectacular explosions. Yep, Bond\nis back.\nTomorrow Never Dies is not\nreleased until December 12th but\nthere is no Felix next week so we\nare reviewing it early. The hype\nand advertising has been\nintensive and the eighteenth\ninstallment is the most expensive\nyet so the film has much to live\nup to. Unfortunately, it never\nquite meets the audience's expectations.\nAll the essential elements of\na Bond film are present. This\ntime the villain is a Rupert\nMurdoch-esque media baron\nwho intends to start World War\nIII purely to increase the circulation of his global newspaper, the\n\"Tomorrow\". Bond's ubiquitous\nfemale ally appears in the form\nof a Chinese agent played by\nMichelle Yeoh, a star in Asian\naction cinema, and Teri Hatcher\nadds sex appeal to the proceedings as the media mogul's wife.\nThe problem is that the entire\nfilm lacks much of the excitement of its predecessors and\neach action sequence seems too\nformulaic.\nTomorrow Never Dies begins\npromising to be one of the Bond\ngreats. The pre-title set-piece is\nladen with expensive effects and\nsets the scene for an intriguing\nstory about the power of those\nwho control the news. There are\nalso some hilarious one-liners\nfrom Moneypenny about Bond's latest fling with a Danish\nlinguistics professor. However,\nafter this the film descends into\npredictable action-packed scenes\nwhich are too long and lack pace,\njohnathan Pryce's villain does not\nhave the flamboyance of 007's previous adversaries and there is\nnot enough interaction between\nagent and nemesis.\nAt one point it seems as if the\nfilm may redeem itself by giving\nus an insight into a side of Bond's character rarely seen. The media\nbaron's wife is a former girlfriend\nof his and seems to be one of the\nfew women he misses and truly\nfeels for, We see Brosnan's Bond\ndrinking and appearing distressed\nat being reminded of his former\nlover. However, this is soon\nforgotten and replaced by\nexplosions and fist-fights, giving\nthe impression of an opportunity\nmissed by the director.\nIt is not all bad news,\nhowever. The film boasts a great\nadversary for 007 in the shape of\na German assassin with a penchant for torture. This sadistic\nn utter, who claims to specialise\nin making the murder of\npop stars appear to be\nan overdose, is far more\u2122\nentertaining than Pryce's character and deserves more screen-time. Pierce Brosnan is more than\ncompetent as Britain's premier\nsecret agent and portrays a more\nvulnerable Bond than we have\nseen lately. He bleeds when\npunched and for once does not\ninstantly get his own way with the\nfemales who cross his path.\nAll in all, this meets the standards of the last 17 Bond films\nbut does nothing to update the\nseries for the nineties. It is worth\nseeing, and not only for the\nblatant product placement\nthroughout its two hours running\ntime. It is just a pity that james\nBond still hasn't really found a worthy adversary since the fall of\nCommunism. \u2022 Chris\n\"Three women to one blok e. If only Imperial...\"\n\u00ae I \u00a7\nFIUM\nCOMPiVriTKIM\nWIN TICKETS TO SEE COP LAND...\nCop Land is a Western-style mob film with an all-star cast. Sylvester\nStallone is a pacifist sheriff who must overcome his fear of the mob\nin order to clean up his town. Opposite him are Harvey Keitel, Ray\nLiotta, Robert de Niro and Robert Patrick to name a few. Rarely has\na director been able to bring together such a talented group of\nindividuals.\nAs if you hadn't guessed, the Odeon Kensington has given us five\npairs of tickets to offer to the winners of this week's competition. To\nenter, simply e mail the answer to the following to felix@ic.ac.uk.\nIn which classic gangster film did Ray Liotta\nand Robert de Niro star together?\nLast week's Alien Resurrection competition was the most popular\nyet. We asked \"Who directed the original Alien!\" to which the answer\nwas Ridley Scott, the genius responsible for CI Jane. The winners\nreceive a pair of tickets and a poster each and they are:\nDaniel Booker\nNikoo Saber\nKatherine Ruggeri\nTony Wong\nVivien Ma "
