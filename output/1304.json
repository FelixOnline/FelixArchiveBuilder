Some sterling runs\nand tackles by the backs contributed greatly to the overall\noutcome of the game, while\nthe forwards were solid in the\nscrums and line outs. There\nwas amazing effort by all who\nplayed, resulting in the best\nmatch of the season so far.\nOur superstar winger, Lil,\nwon woman of the match for\nher blinding tackles, knocking\nany GKT girl for six. Cat, the\nhooker, kept the scrum tight\nagainst some controversial\nput-ins by the opposing team.\nHer powerful tackles managed to hospitalise one of the\nopponents, causing a broken\nleg. Beware, this hooker is a\ntrue hardcore Wye girl!\nThe sole fresher, Nat, put up\na brave performance, lasting\nthe full 70 minutes, despite\nthe ferocious intensity of the\nmatch.\nWith possession on our side\nfor most of the first half, two\ntries were well-deserved.\nOne was a dashing run by the\nscrum half from the 10m line.\nWe went into the second half\nwith confidence and eventually gained another try from\nan amazing piece of play by\nthe pack, the hooker touching\nthe down on the try line with a\nspecial above the head move.\nAndrea converted the last\ntry, to finish the game with a\nconvincing win. Em was also\nparticularly fantastic with her\ntackling skills, which kept our\ndefence solid throughout.\nThis week, our team played\nsuperb rugby, and we hope\nthat the standard of play can\nbe repeated for next week\u2019s\naway match against the\nVirgins. Let\u2019s see how many\nbones we can break this time!\nThanks must go to all our sup-porters, our coach, the touch\njudges, the referee and the\nWilliam Harvey ambulance\ncrew. See you again next year\nGKT!\nRUGBY\nThrees run riot as\nUCL are destroyed\nSponsored by\nImperial Men\u2019s 3rd 49\nUCL Men\u2019s 3rd 0\nBy Dan Lindsley\nThe second run out for\nthe Threes this season was\nagainst the old enemy, UCL.\nPrevious encounters with\nUCL had seen ringers drafted\nin from the teams above, but\nwith every team playing this\nWednesday Imperial were\ndetermined to make their\nstrengthened squad count.\nThings boded well for\nImperial, with the opposition\nturning up late and barely\nfielding a full team. From the\nkick off it was pretty evident\nthe way things were going\nto go. Strong scrummaging\nfrom the Imperial pack gave\nquality ball to the backs and\ngreat rucking left us with all\nthe possession and territory.\nIt soon told with tries pouring in from all areas, with\neven our heavyweight prop\nJoe Sanders deciding that\nhis surname was Rokocoko,\nspinning through the tackles\nbefore waddling over for a\ntry.\nGreat support play from\nman of the match Dave Collis\nled to a stunning backs try\nfrom the restart as well\nproviding others with the\nopportunity to score. Matt\nBanger once again had an\noutstanding game, running in\ntwo tries in the first half, and\nfresher Gonz impressed from\nfull back with strong running\nand a great try. There was a\ngreat debut too for Marcos,\nthe Spanish number eight,\nwho worked tirelessly across\nthe entire park.\nWith the full compliment of\nsubs used at half time, things\nstarted in a similar fashion to\nthe first half. Strong running\nfrom Andy Wright and a great\ndebut try for lock Ben started\nthings rolling. At this point the\nUCL lads started to drop like\nflies, leading to a downturn\nin our performance as complacency set in. Eventually,\nwith a UCL front row suffering a suspected broken\nneck caused by the substantial frame of Joe Sanders, the\nmatch was wrapped up.\nTwo games over this season\nfor the Threes with nearly\nseventy points scored and\nnone conceded, how could\nthings improve? They did so\nin style as the Threes humiliated the cock-sure Imperial\nFirst XV in a close game of\nring tone challenge on the\nbus home, winning 18-17\ndespite the cheating of Firsts\ncaptain Hixxy.\nRUGBY\nWye make a start to\nwinning streak\nSEND US YOUR SPORTS REPORTS! sport.felix@ic.ac.uk\nUCL Beginners\u2019\nTournament\nIt was yet another overcast\nday in Hyde Park when\nImperial College Ultimate\nTeam (the Disc Doctors) gathered for the UCL outdoors\nbeginners\u2019 tournament.\nAfter a quick chuck around\nand warm up, the Disc\nDoctors (DD) got ready for\ntheir first match against fellow London team Brunel\n(also known as STD1). DD\nhad a fantastic turnout of\nover 15 beginners and five\nexperienced players, enough\nfor two 7-a-side teams.\nFor beginners\u2019 tourna-ments, teams are allowed five\nbeginners (less than three\nmonths\u2019 playing experience)\nand two experienced players\non the pitch at any one time.\nExperienced players are\nalways identifiable by hats or\nfunny items of clothing. The\nbest one this year was a tiger\nsuit!\nSTD1 9\nDisc Doctors 0\nThe first game of the day, and\nthe pace was quite slow. DD\ngot right to business, making a number of good, safe\npasses. Well-placed cuts kept\nthe game flowing, but after\nsome impressive offence by\nSTD1, they managed to score\nthe first point of the match.\nBrunel swiftly got into\nrhythm and scored three consecutive points. Disc Doctors\u2019\ndefence was quickly broken,\nthough not through lack of\neffort. They responded well\nby marking tighter and slowing down the STD point-scor-ing rampage. After a further\nfive points, the final score was\nunfortunate, but all part of\nthe Ultimate learning curve.\nOne important part of\nUltimate Frisbee is the call.\nThe two teams gather round\nat the end of the match and\nthe captains say a few words.\nThen both teams pick a \u2018call\u2019\nto do or play. Calls vary from\n\u2018disc fencing\u2019 to cycling on\nmini-bikes, or even drinking\nbeer! After the call, the teams\nwalk around in a circle giving\nhigh fives to the other team\nwho are walking round in the\nopposite direction. This is a\ngood example of the spirit of\nUltimate.\nPurple Haze 3\nDisc Doctors 1\nAfter a short break of practising throws, DD faced the\nLoughborough team, Purple\nHaze. The Haze team have\na good reputation and track\nrecord for both their beginners and experienced teams,\nso the match was expected to\nbe a challenge.\nMotivated from the previous game, DD went on the\noffensive, moving towards the\nPurple Haze endzone. Haze\nheld DD at bay and in a twist\nof fate broke free to score\nthe first point. Purple Haze\npushed hard, making fast endzone cuts, but unfortunately\nmissing the completions.\nDisc Doctors intercepted and\nMagic (Chris R) threw a long\npass to Stas, who sent the\ndisc on to Alvin to score DD\u2019s\nfirst point.\nPurple Haze changed their\ntactics, making cuts to the\nback of the DD endzone, but\na great DD defence stopped\nthemfromscoring.Eventually\nthey scored two more points\nand with less than a minute\nleft, an all-beginners team\nwent on the play out the dying\nseconds. This was a good performance by DD against well\ndrilled Loughborough begin-ners.\nDisc Doctors 5\nABH 3\nDisc Doctors\u2019 third match was\nagainst an all-women\u2019s team,\nmade up mainly of members\nof ABH (Actual Bodily Harm)\nand a few female Thundering\nHerd beginners.\nABH showed what they\nwere made of, putting up a\ngood hard fight. The teams\nwere quite evenly matched\nat the start, with fantastic\ndefence and offence. ABH\nwent two points up thanks to\nsome solid handling and very\nfew errors, but DD began\nregaining control with some\ngood interceptions and came\nback to score. Towards the\nend of the match, the Disc\nDoctors were fighting back\nand scoring points.\nThis match brought DD\u2019s\nfirst win, and great performances from both teams. ABH\nplayed a well-structured\ngame, despite the very muddy\npitch and rain. Hey, Ultimate\nis all-weather!\nLSE 4\nDisc Doctors 2\nHaving beaten ABH, DD\nwent on to play fellow London\nCollege LSE. Hats off to LSE,\nwho last year didn\u2019t have an\nultimate club and had turned\nup this year with a full team of\nbeginners.\nDisc Doctors began experiencing a little bit of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu,\nfinding themselves two points\ndown once again. LSE then\nhad the upper hand throughout the match. After three\nhard games, making mistakes\nwas inevitable, but the commitment was still there with\nDD players admirably laying\nout for hard-to-reach discs.\nThey managed to score two\npoints, but it wasn\u2019t enough\nto win. The game ended 4-2 to\nLSE, a wonderful start to the\nseason for their new team.\nHaving played four games\nof competitive Ultimate, the\nDisc Doctors beginners had\nlearnt a heck of a lot more\nabout game situations and\nthe spirit of the game. All the\nplayers had improved drastically from the first to the last\nmatch, and thanks go out to\nall the experienced players\nthat came to play alongside\nand support the new guys.\nThe muddy shirts and\nsmiling faces showed that\nthe whole team had had a\ngreat time. Even the 9-0 defeat didn\u2019t look so bad,\nas STD1 went on to win the\ntournament!

This year, the bus got\nus to Dover without breaking\ndown, but there our journey\nwas delayed by rough seas.\nSeveral hours later, ferry\nservices were resumed and\nour long journey to the Ecrin\nMassif continued.\nOn arrival, the weather\nforecast looked settled for the\nnext few days, so wasting no\ntime we headed straight up\ninto the mountains. An early\n(Alpine) start saw everyone\ncontinue up on to the Glacier\nBlanc as dawn broke, after an\novernight bivi at Refuge du\nGlacier Blanc. From there,\none group ascended Pic du\nGlacier d\u2019Arsine (3364m) by\nthe north west ridge, and the\nother climbed the south west\nrocky flank of Pic de Neige\nCordier (3614m).\nBase Camp was set up back\non the Glacier Blanc (3070m),\njust down from the Refuge\ndes Ecrin and under the\nsouth face of Pic de Neige\nCordier.\nThe following day, we\nattempted our prime objec-tive, the Barre des Ecrins,\nand a 3am start was called\nfor to beat the weekend rush\nof climbers attempting the\nsame route. Bleary-eyed,\nwith head torch beams vanishing into the darkness, we\nmade our way up the Glacier\nBlanc soon to discover a line\nof other groups already ahead\nof us.\nAlex made short work\nof overtaking our fellow\nEuropeans \u2013 not easy on\nuncompacted snow \u2013 and\nby the time we reached the\nfoot of the mountain, just as\nthe sun was rising, we were\nalmost in pole position. From\nhere, steep snow slopes were\nascended, their gradient and\nthe lack of oxygen at altitude\nreducing our pace to a slow\nplod.\nAt the Breche Lory, a steep\npitch of ice led up to ridge,\nslowing the groups ahead of\nus down and causing a bottle\nneck. Once up on the ridge\nanother difficulty, this time on\nrock, formed another bottleneck delaying those waiting\nto gain the west ridge of the\nBarre des Ecrins. Given the\nsize of our group and the long\nqueue, we elected to summit\nthe Barre des Ecrins\u2019 smaller\nneighbour, Dome de Neige\ndes Ecrin (4016m).\nThe views from the top\nwere amazing, with the\nMatterhorn, Mont Blanc and\nMonte Rosa all visible on\nthe other side of the Alps.\nBut despite the clear skies\nthere was a chilly breeze, and\nbefore long we were descending to keep warm.\nDescending the steep ice\npitch was painfully slow,\ncrowded and dangerous,\nespecially as a gaping crevasse loomed at its base. A\nFrench climber from another\ngroup slipped and fell onto\nNaomi, but fortunately only\nbruises were sustained before\nthe rope prevented them both\nfalling any further. The rest of\nthe descent was uneventful\nand we made it back to base\ncamp around midday.\nWith feet battered and blis-tered, some people spent the\nnext day resting, while the\nremainder climbed Pic de\nNeige Cordier (3614m), this\ntime by way of an exposed\nscramble up the north ridge.\nHaving made good time, we\ndecided to try a second peak,\nRoche Emile Pic (3586m). The\nsun had been on the snow a\nlong time now, and the short\nclimb was exhausting as we\nsunk into the soft white slush\nup to our thighs. The descent\nproved even more tricky with\nthe conditions making slips\ninevitable and falls difficult\nto protect against. Once back\nat the col, we dropped down\nonto a snow slope, inclined at\nan easier angle, from where\nwe sat on survival bags and\nslid the final 500m back into\nbase camp. That afternoon,\na small group climbed the\nrocky south ridge of Pic du\nGlacier Blanc (3527m).\nWith food supplies dwin-dling, another early start\nsaw us reach the top of the\nRoche Faurio (3730m) before\npacking up base camp and\ndropping over 2000 vertical\nmetres back to the valley\nfloor. Dan and JJ cycled back\nto the campsite while everyone else got a lift in the\nminibus. Unfortunately, hitting a pothole at speed on\na descent while applying the\nbrakes sent Dan over his han-dlebars, leaving part of his\nknee spread over the tarmac.\nUnder strict doctor\u2019s orders\nto \u201crest the knee\u201d and \u201cnot go\ncycling for at least two days\u201d,\nDan joined the rest of the\ngroup rock climbing in the\nvalley (on one leg) and doing\nVia Ferrata. The following few\ndays were spent in the club\u2019s\ninflatable canoes (or, as the\nFrench call them, \u2018hot dogs\u2019)\ndescending the grade III rapids of the Lower Durance and\ncanyoning down one of the\nmany icy melt water ravines,\ncarved deep into the side of\nthe valley.\nReturning to the Refuge\ndu Glacier Blanc (2542m),\nwe climbed the Pointe des\nCineastes (3203m). JJ and\nBernard climbed a route\ncalled Le Vieux Piton, before\nmeeting the rest of us at the\ntop for a south-north traverse\nof the pinnacled ridge. With\ndrops of 1000ft on either side\nand the valley floor visible\nsome 3000ft below that, the\nexposure soon had stomachs churning. This was only\namplified by a massive rock\nfall which sent reverberations across the valley and\ncolumns of dust high into the\nair. Thankful that we were\nnot in its path, we finished\nthe ridge by abseiling off to a\nsnow slope. Unprepared for\nits steepness, those not wearing mountaineering boots\nwere soon caught out and\nsent skidding down the moun-tain. Accelerating alarmingly\nquickly, Dan hit bumps and\nflew through the air before\nthe slope eased and the self-arrest was effective in terminating his slide. Numbed by\nsnow burn, and bloodied by a\nlacerated finger, Dan joined\nthe others before returning\nall the way back down the\nvalley.\nThe next day, thunderstorms and torrential rain\nlike you\u2019ve never seen before\ncaused rocks, some the size\nof televisions, to plop 20-30m\ninto the river from overhanging river cliffs. Feeling vulnerable in our canoes, we sought\nshelter on the opposite river\nbank, taking care to distance\nourselves from all things\nmetal as the lightning flashed\noverhead. Thankfully, within\nhalf an hour the storm had\npassed and we continued paddling the unrelenting grade 4\nrapids of the Upper Ubaye\nRacecourse in the rain.\nMore canoeing followed on\nour final day before returning to the campsite for a\nhumungous barbeque washed\ndown with lots of French\nwine and beer (essential to\nhelp the long journey back to\nLondon go quicker the next\nday). A stop and search by a\ndozen French customs officials ensured we missed our\nferry home too. They eventually let us continue after a lot\nof gesturing and the repetition of French sentences that\nmade no sense whatsoever\nconfirmed their suspicions\nthat we were nothing more\nthan \u201ccrazy Englishmen\u201d. We\nmade it through Calais without any asylum seekers jumping on board and reached\nLondon just as a new day was\nstarting, left with the memories of an awesome few weeks\nin the Alps.\nAlex, Martin and Matthew on Pic de Neige Cordier, with Dome de Neige des Ecrins in the background\nOUTDOOR CLUB\nOutdoor Club in awesome Alps\nStephen and Dan on Pointe des Cineastes\n\n"

The\nelection has been far and\naway the biggest story of the\nlast week, and with Tony Blair\naway signing the European\nConstitution, domestic news\nhas been pretty slow. So what\nhave the papers been talking\nabout?\nThe Daily Mail was getting pretty exercised, in a way\nthat only it can, about gam-bling, even setting up a \u2018Kill\nthe Bill\u2019 petition on its web-site. The Mail was not alone\n\u2013 Guardian and Independent\ncolumnists came out against\nthe bill to legalise super-casi-nos as well \u2013 but Mail writers\nare the only ones able to do it\nwith such vigour. Many newspapers were dubious about\nthe government\u2019s claims that\nthe new casinos would create 80,000 new jobs without\na significant increase in the\nnumbers of gambling addicts,\nbut it is interesting that those\npapers that usually shout\nthe loudest about interfering\n\u2018nanny state\u2019 legislation are\nsuddenly the ones asking the\ngovernment to protect us.\nThe Mail spoke about a poll\nwhich showed Britons were\n\u2018overwhelmingly\u2019 against the\nnew bill; but for those of us\nwho read the poll results, this\nwas a surprising conclusion.\nThe Telegraph was more\neven-handed, reporting that\n59% of Britons believe \u2018adults\nshould be treated as grown\nups and allowed to choose\ntheir leisure pursuits\u2019 and not\njust that 70% thought there\nwould be an increase in gambling addiction as a result of\nthe plans.\nThe Archbishop of\nCanterbury also spoke out,\nsaying the casinos would lead\nto a \u2018downward spin\u2019 in parts\nof society. Some Labour back-benchers, in particular Frank\nDobson, were against the bill\nas well, arguing that it will\nbe a tax on the poor. Others\nargue that, like the lottery,\nit is not a tax on the rich or\nthe poor so much as on the\nstupid.\nThe Gambling Bill was\nread for the second time in\nParliament this week and\nwas passed, but only after\na large rebellion by Labour\nbackbenchers who were\nonly won over after concessions from Tessa Jowell, the\nCulture Secretary, including a\npossible cap on the number of\nsuper-casinos allowed nation-wide. Expect further trouble\nand many more concessions\non this Bill before it is settled\none way or the other.\nThe Sun had a good week\ntoo, with the astonishing discovery of \u2018Victoria Barkham\u2019\n\u2013 a Labrador that, with the aid\nof a wig, looks exactly like the\nformer Spice Girl. They also\nfound time to get outraged\non behalf of \u2018our boys\u2019 in Iraq,\nwith the news that they have\nto buy their own kit due to the\nstuff they are supplied with\nbeing seriously faulty.\nWhich brings us nicely onto\nthe other big story of the\nweek \u2013 the news that Iraqi\ncivilian deaths are nearer\n100,000 than the 10,000 previously spoken about. This was\npicked up in a big way, as\nit would be, by the anti-war\nIndependent, who reported\nthat half of the dead were\nwomen and children. The\nreport estimating the number\nof deaths was published in\nThe Lancet last week and\nwas studiously ignored by the\nleaders on both sides of the\nAtlantic.\nThe newspapers were\nreduced to quoting Claire\nShort on the issue. No matter how much sense she\nmay be making, she isn\u2019t\nexactly representative of the\nGovernment on this particular subject.\nWe may, we hope, have some\naction \u2013 or at the very least\nsome mindless platitudes\n\u2013 on this after the American\nelection. Until then, it\u2019s too\ndangerous to mention.\nNew Bill to create nation of gamblers?\nReading the newspapers so you don\u2019t have to: Emily Gwyer looks at some\nof the week\u2019s biggest national news stories\nBy Dave Edwards\nEditor\nA total of around 530 students attended last Friday\u2019s\nFreshers Ball, held jointly by\nthe City and Guilds College\nUnion and the Faculty of\nPhysical Sciences Students\u2019\nUnion.\nDinner was enjoyed by\nengineering students in the\nMain Dining Hall and physical sciences students in\nthe Senior Common Room.\nEntertainment on the\nQueen\u2019s Lawn included live\njazz, a casino, a bar and a\nscalextric track.\nTicket sales for the ball were\ninitially slow, leading to fears\nover its viability.

I often go to the Union Bar and would recommend the happy\nhour at the Polo Bar for a change.

We drank cloudy cider all day then finished off with a\nbottle of champagne on the beach at Bankside while the fireworks went off.\u201d\nMy... alternative\n\u201cNotting Hill Arts Club is friendly place with really clever decoration inside. They have a deep\nhouse night called Underdog every second Sunday from 5pm until late, and entry is free before\n6pm. They also have South American nights where they start with a bit of live salsa and carry\non to some drum and bass. My favourite thing about the venue though is the range of drinks and\nthe free snacks. There\u2019s no draft beer but all the spirits, wines and bottled beers are excellent\nand come from unusual places like Lapland.

Reliably,\nLondon public transport\nleft our team five minutes\nto change, warm up and\nimpress the Essex ladies\nbefore tip-off.\nA capacity crowd of 30\nwitnessed a tit-for-tat first\nquarter with multiple lead\nchanges against a full ten\nplayer Essex team. Weary of\nbeing run into the ground,\nImperial used tactical substitutions by our non-existent\ncoach (applications to our\nStudent Activities Centre\npigeonhole please) to keep\nus sprightly.\nSpirits were high going into\nhalf time with an eight point\nlead. This was short-lived as\nEssex made a third quarter\nrun and left the score tied at\n52 as we entered the fourth\nquarter.\nWith the loss of one of our\nplayers to the Chelsea game,\nthe Imperial boys were\nsearching for an answer,\nand they found it in the\nform of zone defence. This\nthrew Essex for a loop and\nrevived the Imperial offence.\nFrustrated and physically\noutmatched, the Essex players took to fouling, which left\ntheir four best players out on\nthe bench.\nIt was a hard-fought game,\nbut Imperial triumphed with\na final score of 80-66, thanks\nlargely to the 39 points posted\nby Ian Bonzani and the 21\nrecorded by last minute draft\nLaurie Neale.\nBASKETBALL\nHuge haul for Bonzani\nbrings Imperial victory\nImperial Women\u2019s 1st 2\nHertfordshire\nWomen\u2019s 1st 3\nBy Cindy Drinnan\nWell, what went wrong, I hear\nyou cry? That\u2019s something\nthe ladies\u2019 first team were\nwondering themselves last\nWednesday. The team never\nreally got in to the swing\nof this match, and, to put it\nbluntly, we were a bit pants.\nArriving at Harlington, the\nteam had time to warm up\nthoroughly, and our \u201cdynamic\nstretching\u201d was clearly a\nhit with the Chelsea youth\nplayers (our new fan club).\nWe came out strong in the\nfirst half, although not at our\nbest. Flush and Tyson provided excellent vocal coaching on the pitch and were\ndoing their best to get us in\nto the game. Unfortunately,\nour captain Yoda was not feeling well. Nevertheless, she\nfound strength from the force\nand played on. Before half\ntime came, two short corners\nhad produced two goals for\nImperial. Some might call it\ntextbook hockey, with excellent injection from Womble,\nspot on stick-stopping from\nEmbryo and immense strikes\nfrom Flush!\nAt the start of the second\nhalf, the score was 2-2. Despite\nnotable performances from\nTyson (man of the match) and\nSpellcheck, the winning goal\ncontinued to elude Imperial,\nand Hertfordshire went on to\nscore a third. In the final five\nminutes of the game, there\nwas a collective awakening\nof the team and we really did\nplay well, but unfortunately\nour last ditch effort wasn\u2019t\nenough to get the win. As\nthe final whistle blew, one\nHertfordshire player proved\nshe had truly played to the\npoint of exhaustion by fainting\non the pitch. Was the fatigue\ndown to the fact that she had\ncontributed such a sterling\neffort, or was it perhaps a\ncunning ploy to engage in\nsome mild flirtation with the\nstrapping young man who\ncarried her to the sideline? I\nguess we\u2019ll never know!\nIt was a shame to lose this\ngame, but we continue on,\nheads held high, to face the\nwrath of Royal Holloway next\nweek. Whatever it was that\nrobbed us of our mojo for the\nHertfordshire game, be it the\ndreary London weather, the\ndepression of watching others graduate (whilst we still\nhave mountains of work to do)\nor simply the excitement of\nFreshers\u2019 Week wearing off,\nI\u2019m sure we will get it back\nand be eating goal pie again\nsoon.\nHOCKEY\nHockey ladies lose mojo\nUCL Men\u2019s 4th 2\nImperial Men\u2019s 4th 1\nBy Michael Nicholson\nThis was the Fourths\u2019 first\nchallenge against one of our\nserious promotion rivals, and\ndespite starting the game\nwell, we were eventually\ndenied any points thanks to\nanother piece of highly dubious refereeing.\nAs usual we started slowly,\nbut luckily we held firm and\ngradually dug in to get a\ndecent foothold in the game,\nculminating in another goal\nfor Shwin. Most of the credit\nfor the goal should go to\nAldridge-Carlos who blasted\ndown the left wing with all\nthe grace of a giraffe on some\nof Adrian Mutu\u2019s special\nbrew. Eventually he made it\nto the box where he hit a\ncross-shot which the keeper\n(the identical twin of our\nown Tom Clifton) parried to\nthe feet of Shwin\u2019s, who just\nhad to roll it in. One-nil and\ncruising.\nSadly we were having\ntrouble at set pieces, with\nfree headers being gifted at\nevery corner and free kick.\nEventually, one of their big\ndefenders got his head on to a\ncorner from the left, resulting\nin the ball bouncing around\nthe box. Sadly their striker\nreacted more quickly than\nShinguards, and hooked in a\ndecent finish past a helpless\nVanni.\nAt half time Ant was\nreplaced in midfield by Dave\nand, with the rain continuing to pour, it became evident\nthat the next goal would be\nvital. Imperial were riding\ntheir luck with Vanni making some good saves, and\nShinguards blocking one on\nthe line. Sadly UCL eventually got the crucial goal, when\ntheir lanky striker, and the\nproud owner of another mullet (what is it with us and mul-leted strikers), ran from an\nobvious offside position and\nrounded to Vanni to score.\nAnt, refereeing, had to go with\nthe decision of their linesman,\nthe \u201cginger whinger\u201d, and the\ngoal stood.\nStill we had chances to pull\nthe game back, with Dave\nshanking a half chance, and\nthe \u2018keeper smothering well\nfrom Jai. The final whistle came just too soon, and\nImperial were subjected,\nunluckily, to their first defeat\nof the season. Still, heads up\nboys! Lots to play for.\nFOOTBALL\nFourths undone by\nyet another mullet\nImperial Men\u2019s 4th 3\nLSE Men\u2019s 4th 3\nBy Michael Nicholson\nIt was a sad day for Imperial\u2019s\nFourths as they failed to beat\na decent LSE side despite\nplaying, in the words of captain Vanni, their \u201csexiest football\u201d of the season.\nIn response to the first\ndefeat at the hands of UCL,\nthe Fourths made a number\nof changes. Controversially,\nAldridge-Carlos kept his\nplace at left-back ahead of\nthe returning Ed Goh, whose\nsore something-or-other must\nhave healed. Michael Hughes\nslipped into central midfield,\nalongside Dave the Hippy,\nwho turned up to the match\nwearing shirt, tie, and\u2026 flip-flops. To the amusement of\neveryone, the aforementioned\nfootwear forced him to suffer\nthe indignity of rejection from\nthe fine establishment that is\nCheapskates.\nTo the match itself, and for\nthe fourth time in four games\nfortheFourths,itwasImperial\nwho got themselves in front. A\nfree kick was awarded on the\nright-hand edge of the box,\nand while the defence were\nmuttering amongst themselves about how this one\nwould really suit a left-footer,\nup stepped Shwin to loop a\nright-footed shot over the wall\nand into the net. There\u2019s a\nreason why defenders aren\u2019t\nallowed near any free kicks.\nSeconds later, the Hippy\nburst through midfield and\nhit a decent shot from range,\nwith his now fully clothed\nright foot. Much to his annoy-ance, it crashed off the bar\nand found its way to Chris\non the left. Being a physicist,\nChris measured the wind-speed, checked his angles and\nsmacked a goal of the season\ncontender into the top right\ncorner.\nTwo-nil and coasting,\nVanni\u2019s team-talk centred on\nnot conceding stupid goals.\nHow that would come back\nto haunt him. Two minutes\nafter the restart, LSE\u2019s afro-haired sub got the break of\nthe ball on the corner of the\nbox. Vanni was caught in no\nman\u2019s land, and to his credit,\nthe afro threaded an amazing finish around Vanni and\ninto the corner. The response\nfrom Imperial was immediate though, as Shwin restored\nthe two-goal advantage with a\ndeflected shot after good work\nfrom Perry, who had replaced\nthe terminally injured Jai at\nhalf time.\nStill Imperial\u2019s penchant\nfor losing soft goals came\nback to haunt them, as first a\nmix-up allowed the Afro time\nand space on the right, and\nhis cross picked out his fellow striker who struck with\na good right foot shot. Then,\nunbelievably, for the third\ntime in the match, Imperial\nwere caught out by a long ball\nover the top. Vanni misjudged\nthe flight of the ball, and his\nhesitation was fatal as the\nLSE striker got there first and\nbent it around the stranded\n\u2018keeper to even things up.\nThat\u2019s how it ended, but\nImperial can take heart from\nanother great display. As\nsoon as the back line learn\nto protect the good work of\nthe forwards, victories, and\nhopefully promotion, will be\ncertain.\nFOOTBALL\n\u2018Sexy\u2019 Fourths\ndenied by LSE\n\n"

    "content": "By Cassandra Aldrich\nCareers Editor\nRecruitment season may\nhave left you with the impression that employment opportunities exist solely within the\nCity. Imperial is specifically\ntargeted by the City institu-tions, which is great if that\u2019s\nthe route you want to take,\nbut not so good for diversity\nat recruitment events.\nSo, to remind myself that\nthe choice is not only between\nbanking and management\nconsultancy, I started to jot\ndown some other professions.\nThe first thing that came to\nmind was intelligence work!\nSpooks has left me a little\nobsessed, but it is compulsive\nviewing. Just as a career in\nmedicine is not likely to lead\nto a life out of ER, I must also\nremind myself here that the\nreality probably isn\u2019t quite\nthe same as the programme.\nHowever, it is a fact that the\nintelligence agencies are\nincreasing their recruitment.\nWorking in the Civil Service\nprobably sounds slightly more\ndown to earth. I have never\nthought of the Civil Service as\na potential employer and only\nhad a vague idea of the differ-enttypesofworktheydo.After\nlooking at their website I was\nimpressed with the variety of\nopportunities. Departments\ninclude International\nDevelopment, the Foreign\nand Commonwealth Office,\nthe Defence Science and\nTechnology Laboratory\n(DSTL), the Forensic Science\nService, the Cabinet Office,\nthe Charity Commission and\nloads more.\nThere is also a Fast Stream\noption for graduates who, if\naccepted onto this accelerated training and development\nprogram, are earmarked for\nsenior management (see\nwww.faststream.gov.uk).\nOptions for Fast Streamers\ninclude general manager\nor policy advisor positions\nin any government depart-ment, joining the Diplomatic\nService, working in EU institutions on European policy\nissues or working in science\nand engineering depart-ments. It all sounded very\ninteresting to me, and they\ncertainly think so \u2013 the home\npage reads \u201cThe Civil Service\nis a whole world you never\ndreamed existed. It\u2019s a world\nyou\u2019ll want to join\u201d.\nFurther ideas for my list\ncame from a Proctor &\nGamble (P&G) presentation I attended. There are\na number of different \u2018functions\u2019 such as marketing and\ncustomer business develop-ment, but surprisingly I found\nmyself drawn to research\nand development (\u201csurprisingly\u201d, as once I finish my\nPhD the sight of a lab bench\nis very likely to make me run\na mile). It turns out that R&D\ndoesn\u2019t necessarily mean\nbeing stuck in a laboratory.\nA past Imperial PhD student\nwho now works in the R&D\ndivision of P&G UK explains\nhow she has been in the laboratory once only since she\narrived. Although you can opt\nto work at the bench, other\njobs include developing ideas\nfor products (by using information from experimental\nresults and also market analysis and consumer research),\nand matching existing P&G\ntechnologies to ways of making new products. So if you\ndon\u2019t see yourself as a \u201clab\nscientist\u201d, but don\u2019t want to\nwaste your scientific background either, perhaps R&D\nin a multinational consumer products company will\nappeal.\nFelix Careers will have\nmore on P&G next time, along\nwith a focus on media.\nOutside the Square Mile\nCareers felix@ic.ac.uk\nwww.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 4 November 2004 9\nBy Gabriella Silvestri\nCareers Editor\nWhere will the Careers section take you this week?\nObviously we don\u2019t expect\nfreshers to get bogged down\nwith the nitty-gritty applica-tions-and-interviews career\nstuff. But even if you are\nembarking on possibly the\nbest years of your life, you\nhave to have in the back of\nyour mind that pot of gold at\nthe end of the journey: your\ndream career.\nThe transition from student\nlifetotheworldofworkneedn\u2019t\nbe painful and so here we are\nto tell you about CV and applications secrets. Most large\ngraduate firms use the \u2018application, first interview, assessment centre\u2019 model for their\nrecruitment. Be prepared for\nthis: 27% of these companies\nuse telephone pre-screening,\nmore than 40% have a single deadline (typically either\nDecember or January),\nwhilst one third opt for year-round recruitment. One third\nof large companies use online\npsychometric, numeracy or\nverbal reasoning tests (Real\nWorld Magazine, September\nissue). Let\u2019s then get into\nthis prospective: you are a\nproduct and so you need to\nmarket yourself well to tempt\nemployers to invest in you.\nMore or less, everybody\nknows how to write a CV\nif you consider it to be just\na chronological series of\nevents occurring in your life.\nHowever, if you aim high, it is\nnot that simple.\nA good CV is an essential\ntool for anyone on the job\nmarket. It is a written snapshot that succinctly describes\nyour experience and educa-tion. But an outstanding CV\nis more than just good writing\nand a list of activities. A truly\noutstanding CV is custom-tailored to the position you\nwant, presenting information\nin order of relevance to the\nposition.\nHere are some tips that I\nlearnt from Jake Harding,\na member of Elliot Penny, a\ncompany that delivers strategic consultancy, coaching,\nfacilitation and training:\n\u25cf A good CV consists of two\npages and can only have a\nthird page for references.The\nfirst page has to be power-ful, therefore you must do\na lot better than a common\nchronological CV. You do not\nwant the employer to have to\nturn the page to find out you\nare brilliant! Concentrate the\nmost effective information on\nthe first page and target the\nCV for the job you are applying for.\n\u25cf Highlight what you are\ngood at and include evidence\nto show you have the main\nskills most relevant to the\njob.\n\u25cf Build an idea of who you\nare and focus on standing\nout from your contemporar-ies. Ask yourself: how can I\nconvince them to choose me\namong others?\n\u25cf Emphasise how you personally would add value to\nthe company.

Senate\nwww.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 4 November 2004\n6\nComment felix@ic.ac.uk\nLook after\nyour drink\nIn the last few years, drink spiking\nand sexual assault have been on the\nincrease. The use of alcohol or other\ndrugs in order to make a person less\nable to resist unwanted sexual contact has become more widespread\nand continues to do so.\nThe substances used for this purpose are often tasteless, colourless\nand odourless, making them almost\nundetectable when they are put\ninto drinks. This of course means\nthat more and more people who are\nsocialising need to be more careful of their surroundings and more\naware of where their drink is.\nAlthough the issue is now becoming more widely spoken about, there\nstill remains a lot of confusion and\nmisinformation about what happens\nin an attack and what happens if\nyou are unfortunate enough to have\nyour drink spiked.\nIt should also be noted that many\nsuch attacks occur when people put\nstronger alcohol into drinks, such\nas putting a strong spirit into something like lager. This is a particular\nconcern as alcohol is so widely avail-able.\nIt is widely believed that all such\nattacks are committed against\nwomen, however it was reported\nthis year that 12% of calls to the\nRoofie Foundation (a helpline that\nprovides support to those who have\nexperienced drug-assisted rape)\nwere in fact from men.\nWhen you are out and about, it is\nvitally important that you are aware\nof what to look out for with regard to\ndrink spiking. Below are some ways\nto keep yourself and your fellow\nstudents safe.\n\u25cf Go out in a group and have a\n\u2018sober\u2019 person.\n\u25cf Keep your drinks with you at all\ntimes.\n\u25cf Don\u2019t drink anything that has\nbeen left unattended.\n\u25cf Look out for unusual behaviour in\nyour friends.\n\u25cf Stay away from high risk areas.\nIf you think that your drink has been\nspiked:\n\u25cf Find someone you trust.\n\u25cf Show them you feel ill. If need be,\nmake yourself sick.\n\u25cf Don\u2019t leave on your own, as you\nmay pass out.\n\u25cf If you can\u2019t find a friend, make a\nscene.\nIf you have any more detailed\nconcerns or questions regarding this issue, contact the Student\nAdvice Service on 020 7594 8067 or\nadvice@ic.ac.uk.\nADVICE SERVICE\nNIGEL COOKE\nSTUDENT ADVISER\nMuch of my time is spent in meet-ings. In general I hate meetings.\nMeetings are a mechanism for like-minded, similarly-suited bureaucrats to pretend to \u2018work\u2019 whilst\nactually doing nothing more than\ningesting copious amounts of tea\nand biscuits to add to their insulation layers.\nSenate is different. As the College\u2019s\nacademic governing body, it has\noverall responsibility for educational provision. It\u2019s the second most\nimportant meeting I attend. And I\nactually enjoy it.\nMuch of College can feel sterile\nand corporate. Senate still offers a\ngenuine forum for debate and dis-cussion. Academics can (and often\ndo) \u2018kick off\u2019 in a major way on some\nmatter that appeared to be simple\nand non-contentious. Many a battle\non a student issue has been won (or\nlost) on the (in)ability of the student\nrepresentatives to manipulate the\nshow.\nWhy am I talking about Senate?\nI wanted to raise the profile of the\n\u2018unseen\u2019 side of student representa-tion. Students all too easily see the\ncommercial services (bars, shops,\netc) that we run as a Union. To a\nlarge extent, they see the clubs and\nsocieties that are so prolific here\nat Imperial. On occasion, students\nmight even notice a political issue.\nWhat people don\u2019t see so much is\nrepresentation of academic matters\n\u2013 our raison d\u2019etre.\nThe next Senate meeting is considering issues from access to examination scripts to staff redundancies in\nthe life sciences. Add on a sprinkling\nof careers services, teaching quality\nin agricultural sciences, ICT, professional development and widening\naccess, and you get a fairly meaty\nagenda covering broad spectrum of\nacademic activity.\nGet your say!\nSenate\u2019s business is mainly over-sight. Most of the \u2018work\u2019 is being\ndone in subcommittee meetings, all\nof which have student reps. Herein\nlies my first problem: postgraduate\nstudents, and research postgrads in\nparticular. Whilst many of you are\ninvolved as Union officers, we have\na dire shortage of postgraduate\nreps. This gives us headaches when\nwe need student reps for committees (we often send undergraduates\nor someone with no legitimacy as an\nelected academic representative).\nWe have vacancies for research\nstudent reps in life sciences,\nphysical sciences and medicine.\nNominations are now open for a\nsecond set of by-elections. If you\nare a research postgraduate student reading this then please,\nplease, please, consider standing or\nfinding a colleague who will do so.\nVisit www.union.ic.ac.uk/elections.\nThere\u2019s a free box of Harrods doughnuts for the first postgraduate to get\nthemselves nominated for election.\nGo on, it\u2019s easy. It\u2019ll only take two\nminutes to send one email. And\nI really want to buy you some\ndoughnuts.\nOf course, not all student\nrepresentatives get to attend all\nCollege meetings. The Union\u2019s internal processes are just as important for formulating policy. When I\nattend Senate, I need to know\nwhat the opinion of Union Council\nand other bodies is on various\nissues so that I can represent them.\nThe same is true of all student representatives on all committees.\nAt present, the Union\u2019s ability is\nhandicapped by not having a full\nCouncil. If we do not have enough\nproperly elected members then it\nundermines the legitimacy of the\nUnion\u2019s policy-making. It increases\nthe danger that opinions formed by\nthe Union end up representing a\nsmall clique. That\u2019s why it is incredibly important that we have a full\nCouncil.\nSo please, look again at the elections to Union Council. Nominations\nfor the new by-elections are open.\nVisit www.union.ic.ac.uk/elections.\nThink about the doughnuts on\noffer. Then please send an email\nto elections@ic.ac.uk telling us\nthat you want to stand. This time it\nmight help if more of you submit a\nmanifesto...\nAt the end of the day, don\u2019t think\nof Union elections as \u201cpolitical\u201d.\nThe Union is a integral part of\nthe governance of the College.\nUnion Officers are involved at all\nlevels of decision-making on matters that directly affect students.\nIf you don\u2019t take part, you lose\nyour say.\nMUSTAFA ARIF\nUNION PRESIDENT\nSTATE OF\nTHE UNION\nSign up now!\nWhy not get active in the community whilst you\u2019re at Imperial\nCollege London?

    "content": "Five famous physicists\nWhat does Stephen Hawking think the most important advances of science were?\nHarriet Wellington finds out in hardback technicolour\nBooks books.felix@ic.ac.uk\nHawking\u2019s grand tour of modern\nastronomy singles out just five of the\nphysics greats: Copernicus, Galileo,\nKepler, Newton and Einstein. We\nstart with a taste of Copernicus\nand his controversial theory of a\nheliocentric universe before moving\nto meaty biography detailing the\nyoung physician\u2019s Polish upbringing and entrance into the clergy,\namongst finer details that Hawking\nnarrates with enthusiasm.\nA celebration of Galileo\u2019s work\ntakes up the next chapter which\nincludes the transcripted adjuration that Galileo was publicly forced\nto announce prior to his imprison-ment. Hawking neatly intertwines\nthe development of Galileo\u2019s split\nsocial interests and support and\nrejection of Copernican astronomy\nwith an account of the astronomer\u2019s\nambitious life.\nKepler occupies the chapter three\nspot in Hawking\u2019s team for his legendary avocations of the Copernican\nheliocentric universe and concern\nfor the five platonic solids. Here\nKepler\u2019s interest in the universe\u2019s\nmathematical ratios is explained,\nand we learn that each planet in\nfact has its very own musical har-mony! If only Hawking had thought\nof including sound effects...\nNewton comes next in Hawking\u2019s\nhall of astro-fame, where Hawking\npoints out that (just like the average student), Newton conducted\nexperiments in his own bedroom:\nobserving prisms and light and\ngenerally making clever theories.\nHawking chronicles the scientist\u2019s\nlife and work with a pronounced\nadmiration, and here the book also\nincludes quite hefty extracts of the\nPrincipia.\nEinstein concludes the collec-tion, paving the way for Hawking\nto explain what the current status\nof astronomy is. Hawking teases\nus with a little algebra to explain\nEinstein\u2019s theory of relativity, which\nyou will either deliberately leave\nopen on the coffee table in order\nto look rather clever, or decisively\nslam shut with a horrified gasp.\nA disappointingly short discussion\nis included in an attempt to bring\nus up to date with more recent\ndevelopments, and this is the one\narea where Hawking lacks. Whilst\ninteresting suppositions are raised,\nsuch as \u201cWhat happens if you could\ngo back in time and kill your grandfather before your father or mother\nwere conceived?\u201d Hawking fails to\nexamine these in much depth and\nwe arrive at the endnotes a little\nhastily.\nThis is, however, a description\nof the great works in physics and\nastronomy, and although Hawking\nis picky about the few that get a\nmention, the book does fulfil its task.\nThe book is beautiful and the colour\nillustrations really make it special.\nNot only are we given old paintings,\nbut computer-simulated depictions,\nphotographs and diagrams.\nThe book is an open invitation to\na complex and often impenetrable\nsubject without any hint of conde-scension. There is enough technical\ndetail for those who want to get\nto grips with specific theories, but\nalso enough biographical and undemanding narrative to charm any\nnon-scientist.\nThe Illustrated\nOn The Shoulders of Giants\nwith commentary by\nStephen Hawking\n(Running Press)\n\u00a319.20, Hardback\nHHHHI\n\u201c...the physics\ngreats: Copernicus,\nGalileo, Kepler, Newton and Einstein\u201d\nwww.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 4 November 2004 19\nFinding Nothing-interesting-land\nMemoirs of an Imagineer\nFilm film.felix@ic.ac.uk\nin association with\nOdeon High St Kensington\nsee What\u2019s On, page 14\n\u201cSo why is the cinema full of 50 to 60year-olds?\u201d This was the first question I asked myself as I sat down to\nwatch Finding Neverland. \u201cWhere\nshould I put the popcorn?\u201d was the\nsecond question. For the purposes\nof this review, the first question is\nmore important than the second or\neven the third, which I do not actually remember.\nThe answer to my first question\nis that this is a film about the life of\nJM Barrie (played by Johnny Depp),\nauthor and playwright, who wrote\nthe classic children\u2019s story Peter\nPan. In 1953, Walt Disney turned the\nplay into a feature length cartoon\nwhich you may have come across.\nHowever, Peter Pan made an indelible impression on the minds of\ntoday\u2019s older generations, which\nexplains the slightly skewed demographic at my screening.\nFinding Neverland is about\nBarrie\u2019s relationship with the\nwidow Sylvia Llewelynn Davis (Kate\nWinslet) and her four young children.\nThe film tells the story of Barrie\nbefriending the family and drawing\ninspiration from the Davis children\nto create the world of Neverland and\nwrite his play Peter Pan. Inevitably,\nconflicts emerge as Barrie becomes\nmore detached from his life at home\nwith his wife, and grows closer to\nthe Llewellyn Davis family and to\nPeter Pan.\nThe film deals with themes such\nas creativity, childhood, belief and\nfamily in an overly saccharine and\nalmost sanctimonious way. I found\nmyself worrying at times at how\nunashamedly clich\u00e9d the scriptwrit-ing was \u2013 not surprising considering\nthat this was David Magee\u2019s first\nscreenplay. Suffice to say that the\nplot was predictable and the characters were about as interesting as the\nSherfield Building. What is clearly\na highly ambitious and worthwhile\nidea for a film has been wrecked by\na novice screenwriter with a first-class honours degree in crass sen-timentality.\nThen there was the acting. The\nlikes of Johnny Depp, Kate Winslet,\nand Julie Christie were a bit like\nTiger Woods at the 2000 US Open\nat Pebble Beach: way under par.\nHaving recently seen Winslet in The\nEternal Sunshine of the Spotless\nMind, audiences will be aware of the\ntalent which is so obviously absent\nfrom her performance here. We\nknow they can all do better.\nThe film partially redeems itself\nthanks to the child actors Nick Roud,\nJoe Prospero, Freddie Highmore\nand Luke Spill. They carry the\nmovie, giving by far the strongest\nand most intense performances.\nIn fact, Depp was so impressed by\nHighmore\u2019s performance that he\nconvinced Tim Burton to cast him\nas Charlie Bucket in next year\u2019s\nCharlie and the Chocolate Factory.\nSo if you are looking for an unpredictable thriller starring Wesley\nSnipes as an alien space-cop stuck in\na parallel universe where mankind\nhas been enslaved by giant radioactive slugs... then you will have to\nwait till 2005. Finding Neverland\nis certainly an ambitious film with\nsome important messages, which\ncan easily be lost in an age when\nstudios are churning out films like\nAlien vs. Predator. Unfortunately it\nis also loaded with some nth degree\nsentimentality that will inevitably\nalienate students and sceptical film\nreviewers alike.\nDarius Nikbin\nFinding Neverland\nDirector: Marc Forster\nStarring: Johnny Depp, Kate Winslet,\nJulie Christie, Nick Roud\nLength: 101 minutes\nCertificate: PG\nHHIII\n\u201cBarrie, look at my sexy body, my washboard abs.

No breakfast. Was up all last night getting my essay finished and was really rushed this morning. Also had\nto entertain my parents who had come up for the ceremony. Had to get into College early to hand in my essay, collect my\ngown and have my photo taken.\n11am Sneaky banana, just before entering the Albert Hall for the start of the ceremony.\n1.45pm Champagne reception on the Queen\u2019s Lawn. I managed to get two glasses of champagne and five canap\u00e9s with cream cheese and smoked\nsalmon.\n3pm Lovely meal with parents in a Lebanese restaurant just off high Street Kensington. We had mezzo which consisted of lots of little dishes such as a pitta\nbread and hummus, lamb kebabs, falafel, lentils, pastries containing spicy meat, fried chicken wings in lemon and butter, and fried potatoes with chilli and pep-pers. I also had three more glasses of champagne and two glasses of red wine. This was all followed by mini pastries with mascarpone style cream.\n10pm Absolutely stuffed after the meal, so nothing until late. Some lovely crusty fresh white bread with Sainsbury\u2019s Taste The Difference apricot jam, and a\nlarge cup of Earl grey tea.\nRosie Taylor, Felix Science Dietician says...\nStudent total calorific intake: 3500 calories\nRecommended (female) calorific intake: 2000 calories\nAs this is a special day for Kate, one might expect a little overindulgence. The odd day of eating unhealthily like this is not a concern, as long as the diet is\nmore well-balanced on a day to day basis.\nBoth the canap\u00e9s and the meal at the restaurant were laden with saturated fats, with most of the foods containing pastry. Add to this the eight units of\nalcohol (five glasses of champagne, two glasses of wine), which contributed 1200 calories and far exceeded the recommended upper limits of two to three\nunits per day for women, and you\u2019ve got the makings of a fairly horrendous diet. There is no sign of any fruits or vegetables, except for the banana, and a small\namount of peppers in the main meal, which doesn\u2019t go far enough to meet the minimum five portions a day that is recommended.\nFancy a baby? This is a\nthought that most of you are\neither postponing to a later\ndate or, more likely, has barely crossed your mind. Not\nsurprisingly, nowadays an\nincreasing number of couples\nunderstand the advantages\nof deciding to have children\nlater on in life.\nReproductive science has\ncome a long way since the\nfirst test tube baby, Louise\nBrown, was born in Britain\non July 25, 1978. The event\nwas accompanied by furious\ncontroversy over the ethics\nand safety of the procedure.\nSince Louise, IVF treatment\nhas continued to provide a\npotential solution for the millions afflicted by infertility\nand is the most commonly\nused method of assistive\nreproductive technology.\nQuite alarmingly, however,\nrecent news has emerged\nthat babies conceived in the\nlab are more likely to suffer\ncertain health problems such\nas cancer, birth defects and\ncertain genetic disorders.\nThese newborn are twice\nas likely to have a low birth\nweight, which is a factor in\n65% of infant deaths.\nIn the procedure of in-vitro\nfertilization, female egg cells\n(ova) are removed from the\novaries and fertilised \u201cinvitro\u201d (Latin for \u201cin glass\u201d)\nupon the addition of sperm, in\na fluid medium. The embryos\nare then transferred back\nto the uterus where normal\ndevelopment takes place.\nIn some countries, multiple\nembryos (up to six) are transferred in order to improve\nthe chance of at least one\nsuccessful pregnancy taking\nplace. As a result of this, the\nrate of multiple IVF births\nworldwidehasincreased,with\na twinning rate of 25% (com-pared to 1.25% for the normal\npopulation), a triplet rate of\n2-3% and a quadruplet rate of\n0.5% of total IVF pregnancies.\nThese multiple pregnancies\nrepresent further risks both\nto the test tube babies, which\nare at a greater risk of complications than single births,\nand to the mothers, who are\nplaced under larger physical\nstrain.\nOne would imagine that the\nsimple solution would be not\nto put so many fertilised eggs\nin. According to experts gathered at the ASRM (American\nSociety for Reproductive\nMedicine) meeting in\nPhiladelphia on 21 October\nthis year, it may actually be\nthat simple. Studies now suggest that adding more embryos does not boost the chances\nof pregnancy \u2013 single transfers are just as likely to result\nin success.\nComplicating the matter\nfurther still, fresh news seems\nto suggest that not only multiple births but also multiple\nparents may be associated\nwith IVF.\nWork from a group of\nresearchers led by Zhuang\nGuanglun in Sun Yat-Sen\nUniversity of Medical Science\nin China has led to the pregnancy of a woman with foetuses which have three\ngenetic parents. This was\naccomplished by the process\nof nuclear transfer, by which\nfertilised egg nuclei (pronu-clei) are removed and placed\ninto ooctyes (immature\nfemale eggs) that have had\ntheir own nuclei removed.\nThe result is an oocyte which\nmay possess DNA from 3\ndifferent sources: nuclear\nDNA from the original sperm\nand egg and mitochondrial\nDNA from the second, \u2018emptied\u2019 oocyte. These oocytes\ncan then be induced to form\nembryos.\nThe logic behind this\npractice is to increase the\nchance of the foetus having\nhealthy mitochondria, the\nenergy producing organelles\nof the cell. In the US, up to\n4000 children are born with\nmitochondrial DNA defects\nper year. Such defects are\nlinked to a variety of diseases\nsuch as Parkinson\u2019s, can-cer, heart disease, diabetes\nand Alzheimer\u2019s, and may\nlead to infertility.

Congratulations\nalso to all the new members on their virgin races\nfor the club. Needless to say,\nracing of an alcoholic nature\ncontinued until late into\nthe night, culminating in a\ndeserved victory for Imperial\n\u2013 we may not be able to do\ndegrees in running, but\nthere\u2019s always one event\nwe\u2019re sure to win.\n\u25cf Also in Sport this week:\nFootball page 23\nRugby page 22\nHockey page 23\nBasketball page 23\nUltimate Frisbee page 22\nKings of the Hill\nCROSS COUNTRY\nEverything\u2019s more fun in the mud: Imperial\u2019s Cross Country Club pose for the camera after a successful race in London\nRESULTS\nMEN\u2019S TEAMS\n1.

    "content": "By Amadeus Stevenson\nPhysics department\nLast week we began looking\nat ways in which your computer is vulnerable to attack\nfrom crackers or malicious\nindividuals. This week we are\ngoing to look at what vulnerabilities are, why they are\nbad news and how to protect\nyourself in the best way pos-sible.\nAs you all know, the software you use on your computer is made up of source\ncode, which is programmed\nin a human readable computer \u2018language\u2019 before being\nconverted into machine executable code and run. Really\nlarge software, like an operating system such as Microsoft\nWindows XP\n, is made up of\nlots and lots of this source\ncode, which in the case of\nXP\n, with over 40 million lines\nof code, when printed out is\nroughly equivalent to a 600m\nhigh stack of A4 paper.\nIt is hard to keep track of it\nall. Inevitably mistakes, also\ncalled bugs, will creep in or\nbe overlooked. A bug is a flaw\nin the coding, that means that\npart(s) of the program might\nnot work correctly. Many bugs\nare nuisances \u2013 a certain feature might not work correctly.\nMore irritatingly, a bug can\ncause a crash and this can\nresult in the loss of work.\nSerious bugs may result in\nvulnerabilities such as buffer\noverflows, where a malicious\nuser can run some of his/her\nown code remotely on your\ncomputer, doing all kinds of\npossible damage without your\nknowledge.\nHow do you get rid of these\nbugs and vulnerabilities?\nKeep your computer updated\nregularly with patches for\nyour operating system and\nsoftware, which will update\nthe code so that these vulnerabilities no longer exist.\nFor Microsoft Windows\nusers, visit windowsupdate.\nmicrosoft.com (automatic\nupdating can be enabled\nthrough the Control Panel).\nFor Apple Macintosh users,\nvisit www.apple.com/support/\ndownloads/.\nFor Linux/BSD users, visit\nyour distributor\u2019s website\nfor information on the latest\npatches.\nIt is true that Microsoft\nWindows operating systems\nhave the largest frequency\nof these patches, and hence\nbugs, out of the operating\nsystems listed above. There\nare many reasons for this,\nbut that is beyond the scope\nof this article. A good idea\nto increase security, and particularly to avoid spyware and\nadware, is to try switching\nto a web browser other than\nMicrosoft\u2019s Internet Explorer,\nwhich has frequent problems\n(see picture, right) and which\nthese malicious programs\ncan exploit to install themselves on your computer.\nAlternatives are aplenty,\nthe most popular ones including Mozilla, Mozilla Firefox\n(www.mozilla.org \u2013 both free)\nand Opera (http://www.opera.\ncom \u2013 a free version is avail-able). These will work on all\nthe main operating systems\nlisted above.\nMany viruses and worms\nuse vulnerabilities on\nunpatched systems to propagate and cause damage.\nThe widespread \u2018MSBlast\u2019\nor \u2018Blaster\u2019 worm, which\nappeared in August last year,\ncaused massive havoc when\nit infected hundreds of thousands of Windows 2000 and\nXP computers. As a result,\nsystems were rendered unusable due to constant reboot-ing.\nThe Blaster worm exploited\na vulnerability in a part of the\nXP or Windows 2000 operating system to infect systems.\nThe vulnerability had a patch\navailable for it for quite a long\ntime before it appeared. The\nvirus took advantage of the\nfact that many people had not\nbothered to keep their systems updated \u2013 an important\nexample of why you should\ndo so.\nAccording to Microsoft\u2019s\nwebsite, the vulnerability\nallowed one to \u201crun code of\nattacker\u2019s choice.\u201d In the\ncase of the Blaster worm,\nthis was to download and run\nitself. Once running on the\ncomputer, the worm would\nlaunch more attacks on other\ncomputers to infect them, and\ntry to take down Microsoft\u2019s\nupdates website using a technique called a Distributed\nDenial of Service (DDoS).\nAnother way of stopping the\nworm infecting a computer\nin this case would have been\nto use a firewall to block out\nunneeded parts of XP and\n2000, which the worm used to\ninfect other systems.\nwww.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 4 November 2004\n4\n\u201cthe Blaster worm...\ntook advantage of the\nfact that many people\nhad not bothered to\nkeep their systems\nupdated\u201d\nShields up Worf and secure that comms line!\nComputer vulnerabilities and why you should keep yourself updated\nWarning: security holes in software found on a daily basis\nBy Tom Simonite\nScience Communcation\nLast month, the $10 million\nAnsari X-prize was won after\neight years of competition\nbetween 27 privately-funded\nteams from around the world.\nThe challenge was to send\na three-man craft carrying\nat least one person beyond\n100km above the earth twice\nin a two week period.\nNow the foundation behind\nthe prize is expanding its\nremit, planning prizes for a\nwhole series of science and\ntechnology breakthroughs,\ndescribed as \u201cthe greatest\nchallenges facing humanity in the 21st century\u201d. None\nhave yet been laid down, and\nthe foundation is asking for\nsuggestions from the pub-lic. To get you started, their\nwebsite offers a few ideas,\nranging from \u201ca cure for cancer or other major diseases\u201d\nto \u201cartificial intelligence, tel-eportation, molecular assemblers (true nanotechnology),\ncold fusion, or a believable\nvirtual reality system.\u201d\nThis is a clearly a very different project. The original\nX-prize aimed to encourage\nthe development of a private\nspace industry. Although it\nwill only ever be for the rich,\nprivate vehicles would have\nreached space eventually\nsooner or later. The legacy\nof the prize is that a small\nnumber of rich people will be\nable to pay to go into space.\nIn the end the lot of humanity has been changed little by\nthe success of SpaceShipOne,\nwinner of the original prize.\nThe new set of prizes has\nloftier ambitions, but will\nthe same approach work for\nthe very different challenges\nintended?\nThe jackpot, and the challenge itself, are motivational\nand promotional devices.\nJust like the original Xprize, the prizes offered will\nnever match the sums needed to meet the challenge.\nSpaceShipOne won just\na third of the total $30 million bill for the project, more\nthan $20 million of which was\npicked up by Microsoft cofounder Paul Allen.\nJust as before, the prize\u2019s\nmain role is to stimulate the\ndedication of private funds\nto research without imme-diate, guaranteed commercial value. Investors are\nattracted by the concrete\nand recognisable goals, the\nbenefits of being associated\nwith the ideals of the prize,\nand widespread publicity in\nthe event of success. On this\nbasis, private individuals and\ncompanies may already be\nconsidering getting involved,\nbut the success of the new\nprizes ultimately depends on\nthe scientific details of the\nchallenges set. Perhaps they\nshould think again: is it possible to set challenges that both\nfulfil the aspirations of solving major problems, and still\nwork within the framework of\nthe competition?\nA cure for cancer is perhaps an example of the worst\nkind, although it is certainly\naspirational enough. Whilst\nthe treatments available continue to improve, we are a\nlong way from ever eradicating the complex set of pathol-ogies labelled as cancer. Few\nresearchers in the field would\nadmit to entertaining such a\npossibility. More focused challenges closer to the realms of\npossibility \u2013 such as an AIDS\nvaccine \u2013 would be much\nmore powerful. Getting the\nbalance right is a very difficult task, and there is certain\nto be a degree of risk in any\nchoice made. Perhaps it\u2019s not\nsurprising that they\u2019re asking\nfor a little help \u2013 make your\ncontribution to our future at\nwww.wtnxprize.org.\nNew X-Prize for \u201cthe greatest\nchallenges facing humanity\u201d\n\u201cThe jackpot and the\nchallenge itself are\nmotivational and\npromotional devices\u201d\nBy William Gates\nBioengineering department\nBrowsing through a newspaper earlier this week, I\nwas suddenly confronted by\na headline: \u201cTea can help in\nfight against Alzheimer\u2019s.\u201d\nStartled, I read it again. Yes, I\nwas reading what I thought I\nwas. Great, I thought. I drink\nloads of tea.\nBut I am, after all, a scientist (OK... a student scien-tist). Not wanting to become\ntoo enthusiastic too soon,\nI decided to read the small\nprint, which happened to be\nthe rest of the article. Soon I\nfound that my hope had dis-sipated. Tea apparently contains chemicals that inhibit\nacetylcholinesterase, an\nenzyme which hydrolyses\nacetylcholine, a neurotrans-mitter, in the synaptic cleft\n(neural junctions). Reduced\nacetylcholine can indicate, so\ninhibiting the enzyme would\nreduce the breakdown of the\nchemical.\nThis sounded worryingly\nfamiliar. Acetlyl cholineste-rase inhibitors form a potent\nweapon in many insecticides,\nwhere they disrupt the nervous system of the pest, causing it to die. If I drank too\nmuch tea, would this have the\nsame effect on me?\nAdmittedly this is unlikely; I\nprobably wouldn\u2019t die of nervous system failure if I drank\ntoo much tea. Yet this raises an interesting point. Tea\nalso contains caffeine, which\nis another chemical that has\nvarious negative side-effects.\nSo, if I were an Alzheimer\u2019s\nsufferer and I drank 20 cups\nof tea a day to try to increase\nthe concentration of the acetyl\ncholinesterase inhibitors in\nmy body, the chances are that\nI would develop conditions\nthat were damaging to my\nhealth, rather than positive.\nSo are we, as consumers,\nmisled by research that is\nspecifically weighted so as to\npromote a certain product?\nNot that I am accusing tea\ncompanies of fabricating evidence for the health properties of their product; yet it\ncould be that a certain aspect\nof the research results have\nbeen highlighted to provide\nan exaggerated illusion of\nhow healthy tea actually is. In\npolitical circles, this may be\ncalled \u2018spin\u2019.\nThere are other examples of\nmyths that surround certain\nfoods. Chocolate makes you\nhappy, for example. Maybe.\nBut if you were so desperate to be happy that you ate\nlots of chocolate and put on\nweight, would you be satis-fied?\nI know of no-one who feels\nthat being fat is a necessary\nprerequisite to being happy.\nSimilarly, red wine ceases to\nbe good for you when you\ndrink it in excess amounts.\nWe, as consumers, must be\nsceptical of the information\npresented to us by food com-panies. Might a bright young\nstar in a cigarette company\none day turn around and\nsay: \u201cSmoking reduces fertil-ity; therefore cigarettes are\neffective for use as contraception\u201d?\nUltimately the question\nmust be whether we can\nbelieve everything we hear.\nIn a market \u2013 indeed a world\n\u2013 where misrepresentation is\ncommonly used to promote\nan idea or illusion, we must\nread between the lines. Often\nthere are underlying facts\nthat have been marginalised\nwhen they should actually\nhave been emphasized. We\ncannot trust those who use\ninformation in a way which\nbenefits them rather than us,\nthe consumers.\nIn this day and age, it seems\nthat a certain amount of mistrust is vital.\nMisrepresentation, illusion\nand \u2018spin\u2019 in science\n\u201cIn a market \u2013 indeed\na world \u2013 where\nmisrepresentation\nis commonly used to\npromote an idea or\nillusion, we must read\nbetween the lines\u201d\nDoes tea really improve\nyour memory?\nWinner of last months X-prize: SpaceShipOne\nSCIENCE science.felix@ic.ac.uk\n\n"

Under new proposals,\neight matches will be played\nin one day across three different sports to celebrate friendly rivalry, good sportsmanship\nand enjoyment of the game.\nSince 2003, the annual\nVarsity match has seen\nImperial Medicals Rugby\nFootball Club take on\nImperial College Union Rugby\nFootball Club for the JPR\nWilliams Cup. The cup is\nnamed after former Wales full\nback and St Mary\u2019s old boy\nJohn Peter Rhys Williams,\nwho made 55 appearances for\nhis country during a successful career.\nThe event was originally\nconceived to promote friendly\nrivalry and good sportsmanship between the two sides,\nwhilst also celebrating the\nhigh standard of rugby they\ncan produce. In February this\nyear, the match was played\nat Richmond in front of over\n800 students, staff and guests.\nThe Medicals triumphed\n43\u201319 to retain the cup after\nwinning the inaugural competition 12\u20130.\nThe 2005 JPR Williams\nCup match will take place\nat Richmond on Wednesday\n16 February.

By expanding\nthe Varsity match to more\nsports, we will attract more\npeople to play sport and to\nspectate.

    "content": "DJ Mag is one of the most respected publications on the dance music\nscene, being read all around the\nworld and with contributions from\nsome of the industry\u2019s heavyweights.\nEvery year, it holds an open poll of\nthe general public to rank the top\n100 DJs of the year, and bestow\nupon some lucky jock the crown of\nNumber One DJ In The World. This\nvote is really quite significant and\nprovides an interesting profile of\nthe current state of the world dance\nscene and the tastes of the world\u2019s\nclubbers.\nDJs are generally not popular\nbecause of the way they look, their\npersonality, or whether they\u2019re\nin a \u2018slutty celebs\u2019 feature in this\nmonth\u2019s Heat magazine. No, the DJ\nworld is relatively \u2013 and refreshingly \u2013 free from all the rubbish we\nget shoved in our faces in today\u2019s\npersonality-centred world. A DJ\nwill be popular or not, based on\nthe strength of their performances:\nstyle, track selection and technical\nability all play equal parts, and to\na certain extent so does showman-ship, but what\u2019s definite is that it\u2019s\nonly these things that really make a\ndifference: I don\u2019t know what half of\nmy favourite DJs look like, their real\nnames, marital status etc, because\nit really doesn\u2019t matter! Suffice to\nsay, then, that the results of this\nvote can be taken as a pretty good\nmeasure of who\u2019s hot and who\u2019s not\nin terms of DJs.\nLast Thursday was the Top 100\nDJs announcement party, a night\nreally not to be missed. Not only\nwould they be telling us who the winner was, the party would also feature sets from dozens of the world\u2019s\nbest. Add to that free entry before\n10pm or a \u00a35 donation to UNICEF\nafter, and you need a pretty good\nreason not to go. And no, lectures on\nFriday don\u2019t count.\nSo off we went, to start what was\nto be a heavy weekend of three\nnights out in a row, under the arches beneath London Bridge station.\nBeing a school night, there wasn\u2019t a\nmassive queue so we got inside in a\nfew minutes and found the place to\nbe pumping already. Tonight three\nof the massive arches were in use.\nOne was host to drum and bass and\nbreakbeat, one run by house label\nDefected, and the biggest, back arch\nbeing the \u2018main room\u2019.\nNow unfortunately there were no\nset lists to be seen, so we followed\nour ears to where the music was\nbest and ended up in the Defected\narch. I really can\u2019t comment on who\nwas playing where or at what time,\nbut in this arch there was a right old\nparty going on. Sexy, sunny house\nmusic filled the air \u2013 notably Praise\nCats\u2019 Shine on Me, one of my tunes\nof the year \u2013 and people were getting down everywhere. The main\nroom was, as you would expect,\npretty packed, and rocking all night\nto the likes of James Zabelia and\nArmin van Buuren. The drum and\nbass arch seemed to be rolling from\nthe outside, though when we took a\nlook near the end of the night, the\nmusic had changed down a gear to\nbreakbeat, and it seemed that the\nroom had emptied a bit.\nApparently at midnight they\nannounced the results, but we totally\nmissed that, and I only found out the\nnext day that the winner, and World\nNumber One DJ 2004 is Ti\u00ebsto, for\nthe third time in a row!\nCLUB REVIEWS\nTake a five minute walk out the back\nof Kings Cross Station, and you\u2019ll\nfind a little hotspot for nightlife.\nWithin feet of each other are The\nCross, The Key and Canvas. The\narea they\u2019re in is an industrial area\nby the canal, so it\u2019s all warehouse-type buildings. I remember my first\nexperience of clubbing in London\nwas here, at The Key, and how stuck\nI was with the atmosphere of this\narea.\nTonightIhadgonedownformyfirst\nvisit to The Cross, for Renaissance,\ntonight with special guest Hernan\nCattaneo. Hailing from Argentina,\nhis is probably not a name you\u2019re\nfamiliar with. It\u2019s one you\u2019re going\nto hear a lot more about, though\n\u2013 he\u2019s number six in the top 100\nchart, and has been going from\nstrength, including recently mixing\na Renaissance Masters CD.\nOn arrival, The Cross looks a little\nout of place. In amongst the old warehouses and factory buildings, it\u2019s\nnicely decorated from the outside,\nand makes you wonder what\u2019s going\non inside to warrant big queues. At\nthis point I feel I must mention the\ndoor policy, since The Cross is one of\nthe few serious nightclubs in London\nto enforce a dress code. I\u2019ve found it\nhard to pin down exactly what this\nis, and have heard variously that it\u2019s\n\u2018smart club-wear\u2019, \u2018no jeans or trainers\u2019 and \u2018jeans and trainers OK\u2019.\nWith this in mind, I had suitable\nattired myself with no denim, and\nshoes that were definitely not train-ers, and advised my companion for\nthe evening similarly. Unfortunately\nit was not enough, and as we got to\nthe head of the queue he was told he\nwouldn\u2019t get in, as he looked too cas-ual. In the end my friend went home,\nand I queued again for another try.\nI understand the reasons behind\nthe dress code, and am willing to go\nalong with it, but I have say it spoilt\nmy night, and I think it\u2019s a shame.\nThis had been the main reason I\u2019d\nbeen apprehensive about the place,\nand it may be a reason not to go\nback. One way or another, if you\u2019re\nplanning on visiting The Cross, I\u2019d\nmake sure you think about what\nyou\u2019re wearing first.\nIssues aside, I got in eventually,\nalbeit alone, and was ready to party.\nThe Cross is made up of three arches of music, with a bar/lounge in\nbetween each. The last arch from\nthe entrance is the main one, with\nthe DJ at one end, and the floor rising toward the back, where there\u2019s\nan exit to the neatest part of the\nwhole place, the outdoor terrace.\nThis is effectively an extra chill out\narea, nicely decorated with seating\nand space to dance just outside the\nmain arch, and it\u2019s a great place to\nlet some of the sweat evaporate and\nmake some new friends.\nHaving had a good nose around\nto check the place out, it was time\nto get lost in the music. With the\nsecond arch providing more funky\nhouse, the main arch was home to\nthe progressive beats provided by\nDesyn Masiello and Pete Goodwing.\nThe main attraction, though,\nwas Hernan Cattaneo. At 1am he\nappeared behind the decks and\nstarted his epic journey through\nmusic. This kind of house is all\nabout a vibe, constant and tight.\nThe music takes hold of you and,\nprovided the DJ has what it takes,\nwon\u2019t put you down until the end\nof the night. Technically, Cattaneo\u2019s\nmixing was almost flawless \u2013 his\nworst slip-up was at one point letting the music get down to a bare\nbeat before the next track came in\nproperly. Aside from that, his set\nwas enveloping, and the rammed\nmain arch went right off. The Cross\nisn\u2019t a huge place, and tonight it was\ndefinitely approaching capacity. This\nwasn\u2019t a huge problem, though, as\nthe place is so well air conditioned.\nHuge vents blow cooling air into the\ncrowds throughout the arches, so\nthere\u2019s no problem keeping yourself\nat a moderate temperature whilst\nstomping like a nutcase.\nThe crowd is stylish, as you\u2019d\nexpect when there\u2019s a dress code in\nforce. As a place to meet potential\npartners, The Cross scores pretty\nhighly \u2013 from my point of view there\nwere plenty of cute women around,\nand they were particularly forward,\nif you know what I mean.\nAll in all, I found The Cross to be\na fantastic club with a great atmosphere and superb music. I can\u2019t get\naway from the fact that my night\nwas spoiled when my friend was\nturned away, though, so beware.\nSimon Clark\nNightlife Editor\nThe End is one of my favourite late\nnight hang outs in London, as you\nmay have noticed if you\u2019re used to\nperusing these pages. The attitude,\nstyle and quality of the place and\nthe people that go there mean that,\nin my opinion, this is the best basement in London to be spending the\nsmall hours in.\nGivenallthat,andthefactitwasmy\nbirthday, you won\u2019t be surprised to\nhear that I was there last Friday. The\nnight was Harlem Nights, another of\nThe End\u2019s great monthly occasions,\nand our host for the evening was the\nvenerable Steve Lawler. Master of\nhis chosen discipline, Lawler plays\ndirty, progressive house.\nOn arrival, the queue was already\nstretching around the corner. This\nwas a busy night, and with good rea-son. The quality of the music on offer\nand the system they play it over are\nenough to draw people, so when a\nbig name like Lawler comes to town,\nyou know it\u2019s going to fill up. Tonight\nthe lounge was a separate area, with\nLawler in charge of the main room.\nThe music in the lounge was funkier\nhouse, so we made for the floor and\nonly left a couple of times the whole\nnight.\nNormally there\u2019s no hassle with\nheat at The End, as their air conditioning is good enough to keep\nyou cool. Tonight it seemed that the\nplace might be more rammed than\nusual, as I couldn\u2019t stop sweating.\nNot just clammy skin, but great drips\nof the stuff rolling down my face. To\nbe fair though, the place really was\nfull, with even the corners of the\ndancefloor filled out with revellers.\nLeaving the party briefly for a\nbreak in the lounge, which by this\npoint was very cool and relatively\nempty, we found some nice hiphop beats to lounge to for a while.\nApparently the majority of the crowd\nwas in the main room, and I can\u2019t\nblame them. Lawler was firing on\nall cylinders tonight, and the crowd\negged him on with plenty of encour-agement. Overall this was another\ntop night out courtesy of The End,\nthe only downer being that it finished at five.\nSimon Clark\nTi\u00ebsto makes it a triple\nDJ Mag\u2019s annual Top 100 DJs poll is the definitive guide to the best spinners on the circuit.\nFelix went down to check out the Announcement party\nArgentine Hernan Cattaneo behind the wheels of steel\nwww.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 4 November 2004\n16\nNightlife clubs.felix@ic.ac.uk\nHarlem Nights\nThe End, West Central Street\nHHHII\nTop 100 DJs\n2004\nLast year\u2019s position in brackets\n1 Ti\u00ebsto (1)\n2 Paul Van Dyk (2)\n3 Armin Van Buuren (3)\n4 Sasha (4)\n5 Ferry Corsten (6)\n6 Hernan Cattaneo (22)\n7 Christopher Lawrence (35)\n8 John Digweed (5)\n9 Paul Oakenfold (8)\n10 Deep Dish (10)\nWell it seems that trance is still on\ntop.

    "content": "Lured in by \u00a31 student tickets and\nthe promise of a complimentary\nCobra beer post-performance, I\ntook myself off this Friday evening\nto the Royal Festival Hall for my\nfirst ever live orchestra experi-ence.\nDespite avid participation in a high\nschool ensemble, my knowledge and\nunderstanding of the plethora of\nclassical composers is sadly fairly\nminimal. I entered the auditorium\narmed with little beyond the names\nof the three composers behind the\nnight\u2019s pieces and a vague sense of\nexcitement for this excursion into\nthe unknown.\nGiven the above preamble, I am\nperhaps unqualified to \u2018review\u2019 the\nevening\u2019s performance in the strictest sense of the word, but would\nnevertheless like to attempt to convey my experience to you in a bid to\nensnare a few more specimens into\ngiving a classical concert a go.\nIt was to be a night of Russian\nmusic by the composers Stravinsky,\nProkofiev and Rimsky-Korsakov. I\nentered the hall and took my seat\nin the choir section and thus had\nfull view of both the players and\nthe main audience. The orchestra\npromptly filed in and began tuning\ntheir instruments in preparation\nfor the arrival of their conductor.\nThis duly occurred when a certain\nVassily Sinaisky, an aged and wiry\nRussian sporting a mass of unruly\ngrey curls, took to the stage gracing\nboth the public and his orchestra\nwith a deep bow and cheeky grin.\nWithout delay, the company\nlaunched into its first piece,\nStravinsky\u2019s Scherzo Fantastique,\nOpus 3. With no preconceived\nnotion of what to expect, I spent\nthe duration of this piece watching\nin fascination as Sinaisky writhed\nround the podium, swinging his\narms to and fro, baton in hand,\nsending cryptic signals to his minions to create what appeared to\nmy untrained eye and ear a vigorous and triumphant performance.\nDouble bassists smacked their\nstrings to produce a rich and heavy\npulse, violins crescendoed to earsplitting effect, oboes squeezed in\ntheir thin, fragile lament between\nthe more powerful reverberations\nof the brass and a majestic, solitary\nflute rose above them all to captivate the entire hall and bring the\nScherzo to conclusion.\nBy this point I was thoroughly embroiled in my study of each\ninstrumentalist and their toils with\nthe music and watched with interest as members of the orchestra\nswitched seats and re-jigged instruments in preparation for the second\npiece of the evening, Prokofiev\u2019s\nConcerto 3 in C for Piano and\nOrchestra, Opus 26, a piece that\nbelonged to its solo pianist from\nstart to finish.\nThe charismatic Jean-Efflam\nBavouzet was quite clearly relishing his every moment on stage and\ndid indeed deliver a polished and\nmoving performance. He concluded with great panache and was\napplauded excitedly by the packed\nauditorium. After several returns\nto the stage, and much over-zealous\nbowing and grinning, he sauntered\nback to his piano and proceeded\nto delight the audience with a five\nminute solo delivered with perhaps\njust an ounce too much self-indul-gence.\nRimsky-Korsakov\u2019s symphonic\nsuit Scheherazade, Opus 35, is composed of four movements and based\non the Arabian Nights stories. The\nmusic thus manages to envelope\nthe listener into its fairy-tale setting and evokes a distinctly oriental\natmosphere. The piece alternates\nbetween the signature of the hulking menace of a Sultan, represented through strident, confident\ngroupings of strings complemented\nby a self-assured tuba and a pair\nof bassoons, and his Scheherazade\nrippling through this rumble on a\nsolo violin and graceful woodwind\naccompaniment.\nThis lengthy suite was the showpiece of the evening, delighting\nplayers, audience and myself; I\nremained enthralled from start to\nfinish. Armed with the programme\nnotes on what I should be looking out\nfor through the progression of each\nmovement, I felt better equipped to\nappreciate the complexities of what\nwas unrolling before me. I proudly\nrecognized the \u201cshivering strings\u201d\nsignalling \u201cdanger and adventure\u201d\nin the second movement and could\nappreciate the sound of the sea\nthrough the \u201cheaving\u201d strings in\nthe first movement. By the end of\nthe fourth movement, as the Sultan\nand Scheherazade are reconciled,\nI too let out a deep sigh of relief\n\u2013 the story and music had come to\na successful conclusion and I had\nsurvived my first foray into the\nclassical world.\nI had done much more than just\nsurvive though. I had thoroughly\nenjoyed the evening, full, as it was,\nof novel excitement.\nI compel you all to give such a\nconcert a go. From as little as one\npound you can take a break from\nyour scientific study, spend a couple of hours in the company of some\ntalented musicians and exit with\na peculiar sensation that, despite\nthe loss of that pound, your world\nhas become that little bit richer\nfrom what you have just exposed\nyourself to.\n\u25cf Information on the\nPhilharmonic\u2019s programme can be\nfound on their web site www.lpo.\norg.uk, and the Box Office can be\nreached on 020 7840 4202.\nTo receive regular updates on\nthe special student offers available,\nsign up to the Noise mailing list on\nthe website.\nIf you are already a fan of the\nRussian composers, and wish to find\nout more, I would suggest reading\nOrlando Figes\u2019 Natasha\u2019s Dance. It\nmay seem a bit of a daunting read\nat the onset, but stick with it and\nyou will be suitably rewarded by\nthis well written history of Russian\nculture.\nwww.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 4 November 2004\n18\nArts arts.felix@ic.ac.uk\nRed Square, Moscow\n\u201cI had done much\nmore than just survive\n\u2013 I had thoroughly\nenjoyed the evening,\nfull, as it was, of\nnovel excitement\u201d\nLondon Philharmonic\nRoyal Festival Hall\nStravinsky: Scherzo fantastique\nProkofiev: Piano concerto 3 in C\nRimsky-Korsakov: Scheherazade\nFrom Russia to the South Bank, with love\nLynsey McInnes more than survives an evening at the London Philharmonic,\nserenaded by the glorious music of three Russian composers\nSo, what is this about? Any suggestions from the audience? Readers\nwho were around last year will,\nhopefully, remember the assorted\nattempts that were made to get you\nall involved in the Arts in London\nby encouraging you to subscribe\nto various student programmes.\nAs you can see above, we\u2019ve\nhad some success with the\nPhilharmonic.\nWe are fully aware that orchestras\nare not everyone\u2019s cup of tea. So, this\nweek we bring you the Royal Court\nTheatre\u2019s student programme.\nThere are leaflets dotted about\nthe South Kensington Campus, but\nshould you not be able to get your\nhands on one, here are the basics:\nFor the princely sum of \u00a35 you\nwill receive: discounts on tickets;\nfree drinks at pre/post-perfomance\nreceptions, and for you frustrated\ndramatists out there, invitations to\ncasting, play writing and directing\nworkshops.\nI trust this has whetted the appetites of some of you out there. The\nRoyal Court Theatre is on Sloane\nSquare, very easy to get to, and has\njust recently been redeveloped. It\nboasts a spacious bar and restaurant in the basement (very nice,\ntake my word for it), and the auditorium is more suited to the demands\nof the modern theatre-goer.\nThe theatre focuses on bringing\nnew works to the public. These\ninclude not only works by both\nBritish and international play-wrights, but also works by young\naspiring playwrights who have risen\nthrough the theatre\u2019s play writing\ncourse. Definitely on the leading\nedge of theatre.\nLabelled \u201cthe most important\ntheatre in Europe\u201d by the New York\nTimes, anyone interested in theatre\nneeds a very good excuse not to\nmake the most of the Hype offer.\nGo to the theatre\u2019s website www.\nroyalcourttheatre.com for more\ninformation, or take yourself down\nthere and have a look around. It\u2019s\nabout a 15 minute walk from South\nKensington.\nWhat is all the Hype about? Since I\u2019ve already got started...\nApologies to those of you who really\ndon\u2019t like Russian composers; I\u2019m\ngoing to indulge and continue on the\ntheme.\nI\u2019ve always loved the Russian com-posers, going back to the time when\nI was going to be a ballerina, so it\u2019s\nreally been a while. Their music is so\nbeautifully expressive, full of emotion\nand a fabulous number of thoroughly\nmemorable melodies.\nMost of you will be familiar at least\nwith some Tchaikovsky. Swan Lake\nis quite possibly the world\u2019s most\nfamous ballet, and there are snippets\nof his score for Sleeping Beauty in\nthe soundtrack of the Disney classic\nof the same name.\nApart from Tchaikovsky, there are\na great number of other Russian\ncomposers whose music you will\nhave, no doubt, been exposed to.\nRimsky-Korsakov\u2019s Flight of the\nBumblebee has been hijacked and\nturned into a ring tone. Mussorgsky\u2019s\nNightonaBareMountainalsomakes\na Disney appearance in Fantasia,\nand Rachmaninov is given a writing\ncredit on a Celine Dion song, though\nI forget which one. Prokofiev\u2019s Peter\nand the Wolf is a timeless classic,\nand Shostakovich\u2019s Waltz from the\nsecond Jazz Suite appears in Eyes\nWide Shut. I could go on...\nI cannot recommend Natasha\u2019s\nDance enough, and will leave\nyou with a reminder to check the\nPhilharmonic\u2019s season and with\nadvance warning that the Royal\nBallet will be gracing us with\nStravinsky\u2019s seminal The Rite of\nSpring this spring.\nPaola Smith\nArts Editor\n\n"

    "content": "www.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 4 November 2004 3\n\u201cI suppose hobbits need some\ndescription nowadays, since\nthey have become rare and\nshy of the Big People, as they\ncall us. They are (or were) a\nlittle people, about half our\nheight... They... wear no shoes,\nbecause their feet grow naturally leathery soles and thick\nwarm brown hair like the\nstuff on their heads (which\nis curly); have long clever\nbrown fingers, good-natured\nfaces, and laugh deep fruity\nlaughs (especially after din-ner, which they have twice\na day when they can get it).\nNow you know enough to go\non with.\u201d \u2013 JRR Tolkien, The\nHobbit (1937), p16.\nWere he alive today, the novelist and anthropologist Tolkien\nwould have been as amazed as\nthe scientific community when\nthe 28 October 2004 issue of\nNature revealed the discovery\nof a new human fossil whose\ndescription was surprisingly\nsimilar to the hobbits: they\nwere a little people, about half\nour height.\nBut this is really one of\nthose rare cases when fiction turned fact, as a team\nof Australian and Indonesian\nresearchers, led by Peter\nBrown and Mike Morwood\nof the University of New\nEngland, New South Wales,\nand Thomas Sutikna and RP\nSoejono of the Indonesian\nCentre of Archaeology, introduced Homo floresiensis to\nthe world. The discovery was\nso unpredicted that Nature\neven had to put a \u2018This is\nnot a hoax\u2019 sign on the news\npages, lest somebody thought\nit was some kind of joke.\nThe remains of these little\npeople, that had actually been\ncalled \u2018hobbits\u2019 by some of\ntheir discoverers, show that\nthey were only 1m tall in life,\nand their brain size was only\nabout a third of ours. They\nwere unearthed at the Liang\nBua cave on the eastern\nIndonesian island of Flores.\nThe type specimen, LB1, is\na fairly complete skeleton of\nan adult female, comprising\nof a skull, a leg bone, a part\nof the pelvis, and some limb\nbones. Fragmentary remains\nof seven other individuals of\nthe same type were also found,\nwhich dismissed the probability of LB1 being a freak indi-vidual. Dating methods gave\nan age of 38,000 to 18,000 years\nfor them. The researchers\nalso found bones of Komodo\ndragons, now-extinct dwarf\nelephants, and also stone tools\nin the same site, which gave\nan insight of how these people\nmight have lived.\n\u201cThis find really does rewrite\nour knowledge of evolution,\u201d\nsaid Chris Stringer, head of\nhuman origins at the Natural\nHistory Museum, as quoted\nby news@nature.com. And\nrewrite it, it will. The discovery of Homo floresiensis has\nopened the door for a host of\nnew possibilities and interesting questions for the study of\nhuman origins. For starters,\n\u2018the hobbits\u2019 might demonstrate that the human lineage\nwas affected by the same pressures that dictated the evolution of other creatures.\nFlores is situated near the\neastern end of the Lesser\nSunda Islands, a chain of\nislands stretching from Bali in\nthe west to Timor in the east.\nDuring glacial times, the western part of Indonesia was connected to the Asian land mass,\nwhile the eastern part was\nconnected to Australia. But the\nLesser Sunda Islands (exclud-ing Bali) were never attached\nto any major land mass. Homo\nerectus, known also as Java\nMan, lived on Java, west of\nLesser Sunda Islands from\nabout one million to as late as\n40,000 years ago. Earlier excavations in Flores from geologically older sites (dated 840,000\nyears) discovered crude stone\ntools which were then associated with Homo erectus, and it\nwas speculated whether Homo\nerectus had the ability to make\nboats to cross the seas. Since\nHomo floresiensis specimens\nshow more skeletal and dental similarities to Homo erectus fossils than to modern\nhumans and Australopithecus,\nthe discoverers propose that\nfloresiensis might have originated from Javanese Homo\nerectus.\nBut why were they so small?\nAt 1m tall, Homo floresiensis\nwere diminutive compared\nto their taller cousins Homo\nerectus, Neanderthal Man,\nand we Homo sapiens could\nreach the height of 2m. The\nexplanation might be due to\ntheir island home. Islands do\nstrange things to the evolution\nof the creatures that colonize\nthem, due to lack of preda-tors, lack of competition, and\ninadequate resources. Small\nanimals grow large: examples include lizards (Komodo\ndragon), tortoises (Galapagos\ntortoise), and even pigeons\n(the dodo). On the other hand,\nlarge mammals shrink. To cite\na well-known case, until 4000\nyearsagotherewereadwarfed\nspecies of woolly mammoths\nliving in Wrangel Island off\nSiberia. For large mammals,\nan island\u2019s limited resources\nwould have favoured smaller\nanimals which could subsist\non less food, and natural selection over generations would\nhave resulted in a reduction\nin body size. Also, the environment of Flores was (and still\nis) drier and less productive\nthan other Indonesian islands,\nand scientists had long known\nabout the existence of pony-sized ancient elephants of the\ngenus Stegodon throughout\nthe Lesser Sunda Islands.\nNormal-sized Stegodon lived\non Java and Sumatra at the\nsame time. There is a strong\ncase for insular dwarfism. But\nno such case had been found\nfor humans, before the discovery of Homo floresiensis.\nThey are now thought to be\nthe result of the same dwarfing evolutionary process as\nhappened to the elephants on\nthe islands.\nOur own species, modern\nHomo sapiens, were thought\nto have arisen from erectus-like ancestors in Africa 150,000\nyears ago, and then spread\nthroughout the world. Modern\nsapiens might have reached\nFlores during the existence of\nHomo floresiensis. This could\nexplain the presence of stone\ntools. But at present there\nis no evidence that they did\nreach Flores at that time, and\nfloresiensis could have been\nthe toolmakers. And here we\nhaveanotherinterestingpossi-bility, because floresiensis had\nthe brain size of a chimpan-zee! This might indicate that in\nterms of brain evolution, size is\nnot everything. This is the second major impact brought by\nHomo floresiensis. The little\nguys might be smart enough\nto make stone spearheads to\nhunt pygmy elephants for din-ner.\nAnother prospect brought\nby Homo floresiensis is the\nreturn of a major palaeoan-thropological attention to\nIndonesia. History recorded\nthat Homo erectus (Java\nMan), the first fossil that science acknowledged to be a\npossible human ancestor,\nwas found in Java, Indonesia\nby Eugene Dubois in 1891.\nIndonesia was later brushed\nto the sidelines as Africa\nyielded more interesting fossil humans: Australopithecus,\nHomo habilis, Turkana Boy.\nNow the discovery of the hobbits has drawn the human\norigins researchers\u2019 interest\nback to Indonesia. It has been\nreported that the AustralianIndonesian team that discovered floresiensis plan to do\nmore excavations on neighbouring islands. Look forward\nto more astonishing palae-oanthropological finds from\nIndonesia. In the meantime,\nthere are also plans to extract\nDNA from floresiensis bones.\nThe most important implication Homo floresiensis\nbrought us might be its challenge to some of our conventional views. This comes in two\nparts. First, for a long time,\nhuman evolution is portrayed\nas a linear march to progress,\nfrom lowly knuckle-walking\nape to proud human standing tall. Until several decades\nago, the discoveries seemed\nto strengthen that view.\nPalaeoanthropologists saw\na trend of increasing stature\nand brain size in time. The\noutline of human evolution\nwas beginning to be predict-able. But nobody predicted\nthat human evolution could\nproduce extreme forms like\nfloresiensis: a dwarfed form of\nits probable direct ancestors.\nSure, there were cases like\nthat in other lineages, such\nas horses, and elephants, but\namong humans? No, palaeontologist had ever speculated\nthat it could happen.\nOf course, it should not\nhave been too much of a sur-prise. After all, evolution is a\nseemingly undirected process with no long-term goal\nto achieve. But in the case\nof humans, somehow, we\nnever got round the issue of\nprogress. Somehow we still\nwant human evolution to be\ndirected at producing only us,\nthe single dominant species\non Earth today. As Henry Gee\nsaid in his commentary of the\nfind for news@nature.com,\nthe uniqueness of humans had\nbecome ingrained in our phi-losophy, ethics, religion, and\neven our science. And this is\nthe second part: the challenge\nto our notion of uniqueness.\nThere are only one human\nspecies on Earth now, but it\nhad not been always so. There\nwere times when our ancestors lived alongside other\nhuman species. They lived\nside by side Neanderthals in\nEurope and Middle East, and\nthe last populations of Homo\nerectus in Java. They might\nalso have encountered the\nhobbits, Homo floresiensis, as\nthey spread across the world.\nFurther back, one or two million years ago, there were\nass many as four species of\nancient humans living together in Africa. We were not alone.\nAnd I wonder how our ancestors treat the other human\nspecies. Did they ignore each\nother? Did they treat them as\nfriends? Enemies? Or even as\njust another animal to hunt?\nWe are left to speculate the\npossibilities.\nIn time, we will address the\nchallenges Homo floresiensis\nbrought. But for now, let us\njust celebrate the introduction of this new and extraordinary member of our family,\nFlores Man, the \u2018hobbit\u2019, Homo\nfloresiensis. We did not get\nto meet them in life, but we\ncould still imagine the world\nthey lived in, a world almost\nunreal. They were a little\npeople, they lived in the presence of (Komodo) dragons,\nand they probably hunt dwarf\nelephants.\nThey were the real hobbits.\n\u25cf Visit Nature magazine\u2019s\nwebsitewww.nature.com\nfor the paper by Brown\net al\nDiscovery of \u2018hobbit\u2019 man confounds experts\nAndya Primanda reports on the discovery of Homo floresiensis and explains why it\nrewrites our understanding of the evolutionary process and who we really are\n\u201cIslands do strange\nthings to the\nevolution of creatures\nthat colonize them\u201d\n\u201c...for a long time,\nhuman evolution was\nportrayed as a linear\nmarch to progress from\nlowly knuckle-walking\nape to proud human\nstanding tall\u201d\nHomo floriensis\u2019 remains were found on the Indonesian island of Flores\nDid our ancestors mingle with \u2018hobbits\u2019 like these?\n\u201cNature even had to\nput a \u2018This is not a\nhoax\u2019 sign lest somebody thought it was\nsome kind of joke\u201d\nScience science.felix@ic.ac.uk\n\n"

    "content": "Who are the real pirates?\nIn response to Numaan Chaudhry\u2019s article on illegal downloads in last week\u2019s Felix,\nMatheus van den Bergh argues that the music industry are the real villains of the piece\nwww.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 4 November 2004\n8\nCOMMENT felix@ic.ac.uk\nIn any discussion of the music indus-try, it is vital to keep one fact in mind:\nit\u2019s all about the artists and the\nfans. Everyone else involved is just\na useful intermediary, and like all\nmiddlemen they face the prospect\nof being superceded by advancing\ntechnology. There will probably be\nrecord labels for years to come, but\ntheir role is changing and the \u2018big\nfive\u2019 behemoth labels seem unable\nto adapt. It certainly doesn't help\nthat record labels (especially the big\nones) are routinely accused of using\nbyzantine \u2018Enron-style\u2019 accounting\ntechniques to defraud their artists.\nThroughoutthelatenineties,labels\npassed up opportunities to develop\nonline music distribution. Indeed,\nthey only took notice of the internet's\nexistence when Napster turned\nMP3 sharing from the preserve of\nthe technically adept few into the\nnew hobby of the wired masses.\nThe RIAA\u2019s (Recording Industry of\nAmerica) response was to litigate\n(not legislate as Numaan Chaudhry\nclaimed in last week\u2019s Felix) Napster\ninto the ground. Perhaps they na\u00efvely imagined that this would be the\nend of the problem. One might have\nexpected that Napster\u2019s popularity\nwould serve as a wake up call to the\nindustry. Unfortunately, they missed\nthe boat again.\nSpeaking of lawsuits, the RIAA\u2019s\nlegal campaign of terror, which the\nBPI (the RIAA\u2019s sister organisation\nin the UK) is now bringing to this\nside of the Atlantic, has achieved\n\u2013 despite Chaudhry's comments\n\u2013 absolutely nothing. The RIAA has\noften quoted a statistic indicating\na 50% drop in file sharing activity\nsince they deployed their legal beagles against errant downloaders, but\nunfortunately that figure is based on\ndeeply flawed studies. The surveys\ndid not take into account the migration of users from older, established\nnetworks to newer ones which are\nmore difficult to trace. They also\nrelied on asking a large group of\nAmerican adults about their music\ndownloading habits, which is a bit\nlike basing crime statistics on the\nresults of a door to door poll conducted by local policemen. In fact,\nall that they can be said to show is\nthat in the wake of a cluster bomb\nof lawsuits aimed at heavy Kazaa\nusers, people are (a) moving to\nother networks, the users of which\nhave not yet been targeted, and (b)\nless likely to admit to using Kazaa.\nSurprise!\nQuite aside from their ineffec-tiveness, the lawsuits are morally\ndubious. Among those torpedoed by\nthe RIAA\u2019s lawyers was a 12-year-old girl from a lower income family.\nLike most of the targeted \u2018pirates\u2019,\nher family eventually settled out ot\ncourt. In her case, the RIAA had to\nmake do with a settlement of only\n$2000 \u2013 not a bad haul considering\nthat this was the all of the family's\nsavings. Who are the real pirates\nhere?\nNot all musicians are thrilled to\nsee their fans reduced to destitution.\nOne prominent musician denounced\nthe RIAA\u2019s tactics as \u201cpure Gestapo\u201d.\nThe Association\u2019s claim to be protecting the artists is also dubious.\nDisturbed\u2019s David Draiman reacted\nby saying: \u201cProtecting the artists,\nmy ass. I didn\u2019t ask them to protect\nme, and I don't want their protection.\u201d\nThere isn\u2019t even any evidence that\nfile sharing really decreases CD\nsales. Chaudhry tells us that 2001\nwas a bad year for the industry and\nsays that \u201cthere are no prizes for\nguessing the root cause of this\u201d.\nCertainly none that our esteemed\nbusiness editor is likely to win. The\neconomic recession that started in\nearly 2001 and only got worse after\nthe 11 September might have had\nsomething to do with it. In general,\nsales of luxury items are the first\nand hardest hit by any economic\ndownturn, so a modest decline in\nsales is hardly surprising. Indeed,\nin the second quarter of 2004, with\nfile sharing more popular than ever,\nCD sales actually increased by more\nthan 10%. Not only that, but several\nrecent studies have shown a positive\ncorrelation between filesharing and\nmusic purchases.\nThis fits neatly with the experiences of the many unsigned bands who\nhave used the internet to promote\nthemselves and find audiences that\nwould otherwise have been out of\ntheir reach. According to Chaudhry,\nsaying that greater exposure leads\nto higher sales is a \u201cflawed argument\u201d, but he gives no good reasons\nfor this bizarre assertion. He posits a\nhypothetical situation in which there\nare artists who prefer to be obscure\nand without fans.\nThe industry may finally be moving into this century. Apple has managed to wrangle distribution contracts with large numbers of major\nlabels, and this number will likely\nincrease in the wake of iTunes' suc-cess. Unfortunately, all is not well in\nelectronic distribution land \u2013 there\nare indications that labels are using\nthe transition to new distribution\nchannels for a sordid orgy of financial shenaningans. Understandably,\nartists are not at all amused by this.\nCan the major record labels fix their\nproblems and embrace modernity?\nOnly time will tell.\nA rather extreme message on the\nsubject of pirate MP3s\nBy Nichola Hawkins\nat the Wye campus\nAs Wye Charity Week is in full swing,\nit is hard to imagine why anyone\nwould want to be anywhere else.\nHowever, once the week is over,\nthe next major event will be the\nlaunch of Campus Link, a scheme\nthat will hopefully allow Wye students to participate in some events\nat the main campus.\nThe scheme has taken several\nmonths to set up, largely because of\nthe amount of funding that had to be\nsecured. It will allow each student,\nundergraduate and postgraduate, to\nattend up to three specific College or\nUnion events at South Kensington\nper academic year, by reimbursing\nthe cost of train tickets.\nThe scheme was first suggested\nafter comments made by Sir Richard\nSykes in a lecture last year hinted\nthat Wye did not fit into his vision for\nImperial\u2019s future, a comment that he\nlater clarified as having meant that\nWye had not integrated as well as\nmight have been hoped. Cynics may\nclaim that the idea was merely an\nattempt to regain favour after that\npublic relations hiccup, but whether\nor not that is the case, the scheme\nis likely to be welcomed by at least\nsome students.\nIn order to ensure that students\nare attending the South Kensington\ncampus, rather than the College\ninadvertently subsidising trips home\nor shopping excursions, each student will be given a card, which will\nneed to be stamped by the College\nor Union in South Kensington.\nWye students will receive further\ndetails from publicity around the\ncampus in the next couple of weeks.\nWhilst this is a one-way scheme,\nLondon-based students should\nstill take note, as suggestions for\nappropriate use of the allocated\ntrips include events or activities\nwith London-based Union clubs and\nsocieties.

As a medieval king\n(or queen in my case), you would\nhave two options: either go to see\nhim in person to say a few words, or\nsend a messenger to deliver a letter\nto the person in question, both of\nwhich are not very efficient ways.\nOn the other hand, 20th century\nstudents have access to telecommunications technology, and even the\nmost outdated mobile phone available on the market would serve the\npurpose of making a three minute\ncall to your friend, in the warmth\nand comfort of your home, without\nhaving to brave the weather or having to wait ages for your messenger\nto come back for an answer. And the\noption of sending text messages and\nemails is still there if the voice of the\nperson in question is unbearable...\nStudent life involves living in halls\nwith minuscule rooms or dodgy flats\nwith tatty furniture, and it would be\nalmost offensive to try to compare\nthese to the space and furnishing\nof palaces. But even us students\nhave more riches than the richest people at the time in terms of\ntechnology and services. Tired of\ncooking? You can treat yourselves,\neven on a student budget from time\nto time, by ordering a pizza. Give\nthose customer-friendly people a\nring, promise them a sum of money\nand they\u2019ll be at your modest abode\nin less than no time with a steaming hot dinner! Need some enter-tainment? One can just go to the\ncinema nearby and relax, or telephone a friend and go to the pub to\nchill. More examples? Think fridge,\nmicrowave, computers, radio, and\ncentral heating, which keeps your\nroom at the desired temperature\nthanks to that simple device called a\nthermostat, without having to bear\na superheated room when the fire\nin the chimney is lit or icy cold when\nit is not. I\u2019m sure you can come up\nwith more.\nLet\u2019s move to another more\ninteresting topic, which is that of\ntravel. Most of us here don\u2019t live\nnear College, let alone in London.\nTravellinginLondonisniceandeasy.\nBut what if I lived, say in Manchester,\nor Scotland? Nowadays, we can just\njump on a train and visit our folks.\nCenturies back, it would have taken\ndays to make such a journey in a\ncarriage. And I doubt kings could do\nthe same as in Lord of the Rings and\ntravel from the north to the south of\nthe UK on horseback non-stop. And\nwhat about Australians? By the time\nthey reached home by sea, summer\nwould be over and term would have\nrestarted!\nMy laptop and internet connection are other comforts that none of\nthese kings could have at the time.\nI can just type this article, email it\nand share my ideas... all this, lying\ndown in bed and without having to\ntravel, feeling warm and contented.\nOf course, you might not agree with\nme: kings did not have to bear the\ntorture of never-ending lectures, or\ncook for themselves, or slave away\nto get some more pocket money, but\nit\u2019s just a crazy idea...\nJust a crazy thought...\nZaina Nobeebux argues that many students today are far better off than they might think\nTransport issues affect everyone\nwho studies or works at Imperial.\nMany of you commute in by tube,\nrail, bus or bike every day; others\nuse them at some point to go shopping or go out with your mates. So\nhave you ever wondered why things\noften don\u2019t seem to work the way\nyou\u2019d like?\nImagine this: you\u2019re coming into\nImperial in the morning by train,\nand an announcement is made that\nyour train has been delayed because\nof \u201cleaves on the line\u201d. Sound famil-iar? The media seize on this every\nautumn, but the reality is that leaves\non the line are as dangerous as\nblack ice on a road. When leaves\nfall onto the track, the weight of a\n135 tonne train compresses them\ninto a graphite-like coating which\nacts like a lubricant on the track.\nThe next train that comes along\njust slides along the track when it\nbrakes, which can lead to it overshooting red signals or station plat-forms. Therefore train drivers drive\nmore slowly when there are leaves\non the line, leading to delays, but\nsafer journeys.\nSo, you\u2019ve eventually arrived at\nyour terminus and you need to catch\nthe Circle Line to South Kensington.\nUnfortunately there are none indicated on the departure board, and\nafter waiting for ten minutes you\ngive up and catch a different line.\nWhat is it about the Circle Line that\nmakes it, frankly, crap?\nWell, the poor old Circle has to\ncross six flat junctions on its repetitive trek around London. A flat junction is where trains on one track\nhave to cross another track \u201con the\nflat\u201d \u2013 meaning that whilst a train\nis crossing that junction, any other\ntrains have to wait for it to fin-ish. If you\u2019ve ever got to a crossroads just as the lights go green for\ncars and you have to wait at every\narm you cross, you\u2019ll understand\nhow it can make you late (espe-cially when you\u2019re dashing into lectures from Evelyn Gardens). And\nbecause Circle trains are constantly\ngoing round, there\u2019s nowhere for\nthem to make up lost time. All this\nleads to you being late into College.\nIn fact, plans are afoot to get rid\nof the Circle line completely, by\nchanging the service patterns of\na number of other lines \u2013 but not\nbefore 2011.\nAfter all that stress, you might\ndecide to go out clubbing in the\nevening. You come out of the club\nat 2am... and realise that you\u2019ve got\na long, bumpy night bus ride home.\nOther cities run their metro systems\nall night \u2013 why can\u2019t we?\nYou might not have realised, but\nLondon\u2019s Underground is the oldest in the world \u2013 the first section\nopened in 1863! Like your elderly\ngrandma, it needs a lot of attention to keep it in working order.\nPlaces like New York benefit from a\nnewer system which was built with\nfour tracks for many lines instead\nof two (two slow, and two express).\nThey can keep running trains on\none pair whilst working on another.\nWe, on the other hand, need five\nhours every night just to keep it\nworking during the day! It\u2019s not all\nbleak, though \u2013 the Mayor is considering running trains an hour or\ntwo later on Friday and Saturday\nnights. One day, you may stagger\nout of the club and just catch the last\ntube home!\n\u25cf Dave Arquati runs the website www.alwaystouchout.com\nand is a third year biochemistry student at Imperial College\nTransport troubles\nComplaining about the Underground has become a favourite pastime amongst Londoners.\nDave Arquati discusses some of the major problems and the reasons behind them\nThe tube: \u201cLike your elderly grandma, it needs a lot of attention to\nkeep it in working order...\u201d\n\u201cWork expands to fill the time allowed\u201d\nDAVE EDWARDS\nEDITOR\nEDITORIAL\nHow time flies when you\u2019re having\nfun (or panicking about deadlines).\nIt feels like we\u2019ve hardly started,\nbut this is the sixth Felix out of 11 to\nbe published before Christmas, so\nwe\u2019re already halfway through the\nautumn term.\nI hope you\u2019ve enjoyed reading\nFelix this year. It\u2019s been great to\nreceive so many compliments about\nthe new style, from a variety of\nsources, and I know that we will\ncontinue to improve your newspaper over the coming months.\nI would like to thank everyone\nwho has contributed to Felix so far\nthis year. The newspaper could not\nexist without the time, effort and\nenthusiasm of my excellent team of\nvolunteers.\nIf you have any comments or questions about Felix, or you would like\nto submit a letter for publication on\nany subject, please contact me at\nfelix@ic.ac.uk.\nGraduation\nLast Wednesday, along with some\n1900 others, I officially graduated\nfrom Imperial College.\nAs I listened to the Union\nPresident and the Rector describing Imperial\u2019s illustrious history, I\ncouldn\u2019t help feeling that the whole\nexperience didn\u2019t mean as much as\nit could have.\nEveryone present had already\nreceived their degree certificate by\npost, many of us had already \u2018moved\non\u2019 from university into employ-ment, and the ceremony itself took\nplace almost four months after our\ndegrees ended.\nWith the Government pressing for\n50% participation in higher educa-tion, acceptance at university set to\ndepend more on one\u2019s finances than\none\u2019s ability, and an increasingly\nsaturated graduate recruitment\nmarket, it is difficult to escape the\nconclusion that a degree is simply\nnot as valuable as it once was.\nHowever, even if the qualification\nis not worth quite as much, and the\nceremony was at the wrong time,\nI could still reflect on some great\nmemories and be satisfied that I\nhad taken advantage of some of the\nopportunities that Imperial life can\noffer.\nYour time here will pass quicker than you think and the piece of\npaper you pick up at the end might\nnot be an express pass to the next\nstage, so make the most of the student experience while you can.\nParkinson\u2019s Law\nI was reminded recently of something called \u2018Parkinson\u2019s Law\u2019,\nwhich states that \u201cwork expands\nto fill the time allowed\u201d. I\u2019m sure\nyou\u2019ve experienced this law in action\non many occasions, as you frantically try to complete some course-work. Personally, I want to rename it\n\u2018the Law of Editing Felix, Receiving\nArticles After Deadlines and Not\nSleeping on Tuesday Nights\u2019.\nEnjoy this week\u2019s issue.\n\n"
