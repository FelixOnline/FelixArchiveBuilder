    "content": "felixonline.co.uk | felix@imperial.ac.uk | @felix_imperial\n24 | Sport 15 March 2024\nT\nhe plethora of ski slopes in the\nAustrian Alps make it the best\nplace to learn and develop skiing and snowboarding skills, as the\nslope run difficulties are not only\nblue, red, or black. In my opinion,\nsome slopes are dark red; some, a\nlight shade of navy; and some are\njust pink, an easy red. Taking a random week outside of the national\nschool holidays in early spring to\nhit the slopes gives beginners a\ngood chance to learn at their own\npace, make mistakes on empty,\nwide slopes, and fall into mounts\nof artificial snow at comfortable,\nlukewarm temperatures of air.\nHowever, the impact of climate\nchange causes temperatures of up\nto 10\u00b0C at 2000m elevation, exemplifying the current crisis that\nwe have placed Mother Nature in.\nHowever, this shall be reserved for\nanother article.\nLast weekend, my friend D\nand I went to the Alps to learn\nhow to snowboard. Our friends\nT and J became our teachers\nfor three days. D knows how\nto skateboard, I do not; howev-er, unlike him, I know the Alps\nand have skied before. Hence it\nwould be interesting to see how\nwe both would do on our boards.\nRotation and technique\nTechnically speaking, snowboarding takes the coordinate system of\nskiing and rotates it by 90\u00b0. To ski\nslowly or slide down the slope, skiers point their knees towards the\nleft or right side of the slope. On the\nother hand, snowboarders \u2018heel\u2019 or\n\u2018toe\u2019 down the slope, with their torso facing towards or away from the\nmountain.When skiing quickly, the\nskier faces away from the moun-tain, curving slightly in a S-shaped\nmanner. Snowboarders also form\nS-shaped curves, but their torsos\nface either side of the slope.\nBoth sports require a curved\npath on the snow: a flat board or ski\nwhose face is directly on the snow\nwill accelerate quickly, and the\nowner will lose control and crash.\nMuscles\nWhen I ski, I control myself with my\nheels; however, in addition, snowboarding also requires the toes for\ncontrol, which was quite new to\nme. My toes hurt a lot when \u2018toeing\u2019\n\u2013 facing the mountain. The snowboard put quite a lot of strain on my\nfeet, tailbone, and core, while skiing\nstrains the thighs and hamstrings\nmore. Technically, I can assume\nboth sports activate the quadriceps\nand the core; however as a first-time\nsnowboarder, I found myself sore\nin placed I did not expect, such as\nmy shoulders and arms. This was\nprobably from lifting myself off the\nground every time I fell.\nSlopes and lifts\nSnowboarders and skiers may\nprefer different slopes. Straight\nhorizontal paths that connect two\nslopes can become a nightmare\nfor snowboarders who lose mo-mentum. They cannot accelerate\nas easily by propelling themselves\nwith their sticks, hence they need\nto waddle down a short path or\nwalk with their board in hand.\nLifts are also less convenient for\nsnowboarders than skiers, as they\nneed to unbuckle and buckle their\nstraps every time they get on a lift,\nwhich look as if they were designed\nprimarily for skiers.\nTips\nFirst, wear protection on your tail-bone. J told us how he broke his\ntailbone twice while snowboarding.\nSecondly, do not wear a backpack.\nI found that mine would pull me\ndown every time I tried to stand up.\nThirdly, you will fall \u2013 a lot. You may\nalso experience soreness in the back\nof your neck, as D did, due to whiplash from falling backwards. As a\nresult, he spent a day in bed unable\nto lift his head.\nI grew up skiing, yet I cannot\nwait to spend next winter season\nsnowboarding. I mean, you already look cool just by standing on\na snowboard.\nSPORT\nSnowboarding\nin spring\nSportEditor\nCHARLOTTE PROBSTEL\nJ, D, and I on the slopes in Austria T\nA skier\u2019s review\nof snowboarding.\nWeekly\nScores\nWomen\u2019s Rugby\nwins 79-5 in final\nBUCS match against\nPortsmouth\nPost-win selfie Jo Van Pelt\n\u201cGreat way to end the season.

Allan's\nwords were criticised in a letter to the\neditor in Felix Issue #1845.\nHi Felix,\nThere seems to be some confusion\nsurrounding the quote attributed\nto Mao Zedong \u2013 \u201cthe journey of a\nthousand miles begins with a single\nstep\u201d \u2013 in the latest issue of Felix.\nAs someone raised with a Chinese\ncultural background, I wanted to\nclarify that this proverb actually\noriginates from a much older source.\nThe quote appears in the Dao\nDe Jing, written by the ancient\nphilosopher Laozi over 2,000 years\nago. The specific passage, the sixty-fourth chapter reads: \u2018The tree that\nfills your arms grew from a tiny seed;\nthe nine-story tower rose from a pile\nof earth; the journey of a thousand\nmiles begins with a single step.\u2019 My\nthorough online research has not\nrevealed any evidence of Mao Zedong\nquoting this proverb. (Interestingly, Xi\nJinping has been known to use it.)\nI want to be clear that I am not\nattempting to defend or justify any of\nMao's actions. China\u2019s 20th\n-century\nhistory, particularly the period under\nhis rule, was undeniably tragic and\nleft deep scars on the nation. My\nsole purpose here is to highlight the\nhistorical inaccuracy of attributing\nthis quote to Mao. In fact, such\nmisinterpretations can have serious\nconsequences. Here is an example:\nthe red traffic light was deemed as\ncounter-revolutionary in the 1960s,\nbecause people were \u2018stopped\u2019\nfrom the \u2018red\u2019, a colour representing\ncommunism.\nI hope this clarifies the origin of\nthe quote and the potential impact of\nhistorical inaccuracies.\nKind regards,\nAngze Li\nWin \u00a3400 (and an end-of-term review)\nEDITORIAL\nA\nnd so another term nears its\nend. The run-up to Easter is\na hectic period: coursework\ndeadlines and exams beckon for most\nstudents, alongside mounting piles of\ntutorial sheets and hours of lectures.\nI\u2019d like to personally thank all of our\ncontributors \u2013 writers, copyeditors,\nsection editors, photographers, and\nmore \u2013 who, during this busy time,\nhave put in a monumental effort to\nkeep the paper running.\nIt\u2019s been another eventful term\nfor us here at Felix. We started with\na series of stories on the appalling\nheating problems at Imperial, running\nthe biblical-sounding headline \u2018Illness,\nfire, and fury\u2019\n.\nOne important story that deserved\nmore coverage was Imperial\u2019s\nannouncement in February that it\nwould stop accepting money for\nresearch that propagates fossil fuel\nextraction.Inawinforstudentactivists,\nthe College also announced that it\nwould determine its engagement\nwith energy and fossil fuel companies\nusing the new Imperial Zero Index,\na framework that performs annual\nassessments of energy-industry\ncollaborators.\nReverberations from the tragedy\nunfolding in Gaza in the wake of\nHamas\u2019s 7th-October attacks on Israel\ncontinued to feature in the paper.\nOnly two weeks ago we featured\nthe story of Nael Qtati, the Gazan\nalumnus appealing for support for\nthe evacuation his family as the Israel\nDefense Forces prepare to invade\nRafah. To date, Qtati has raised just\nover \u00a34,000 towards a target of\n\u00a330,000 that he says is required for\nthe evacuation.\nLast month, we reported on the\nnews that Imperial College Union\nwould push for more part-time work\nopportunitiesforstudents\u2013anexample\nof how Union Council can work to\nimprove the student experience.\nUndoubtedly, the biggest story\nto feature in Felix this term was the\nopposition to Imperial\u2019s new logo. Our\noriginal news report on the story has\nreceived over 30,000 views online,\nand has been quoted in Time Out and\nTimes Higher Education.\nWin \u00a3400\nFelix is running the Sophia Prize\nonce again this year. At the end of\nSummer Term, we will pick out one\noutstanding, inspiring, and accessible\narticle featured in the paper, that\nhelps tackle climate defeatism and\ncovers an economic, cultural, or\nscientific innovation that helps fight\nglobal warming.\nAll you have to do to enter is write\na relevant article in Felix! The winner\nwill be awarded \u00a3400 and will have\ntheir name featured in the paper.\nWhile we\u2019re on the topic of climate,\nour Environment section is looking\nfor one more editor to manage the\nsection next year. If you\u2019d like to apply,\nplease email environment.felix@\nimperial.ac.uk.\nThat\u2019s all from us this term. Have a\nlovely Easter break, and all the best to\nthose of you preparing for exams!\nLetter to the Editor\nRe: Council Chair quotes Mao Zedong\nSelina Ye\n\n"

    "content": "felixonline.co.uk | felix@imperial.ac.uk | @felix_imperial Books | 11\nISSUE #1846\nA\nprivate affair starting from South Kensington\nstation and ending at Victoria lasts 12 minutes.\nIn this time, amidst the train of thought obscured by standing Londoners and masked by the\ncommuter scowl, I\u2019d have gotten far enough to replace\nthe preconceptions of the book I was reading \u2013 a little\nmotivation to continue, I suppose.\nBut ultimately, I would not have read enough to establish a proper sense of direction of what I was reading\n(and actually, what my motivations were to continue),\nright before I alight from the District Line, ready to focus on minimising the steps it takes for the interchange.\nThis traditional agreement of reading on the commute has served me over the years. It has helped to get\nthrough a number of smaller reads \u2013 Lord of the Flies,\nThe Bell Jar, and Sula \u2013 and set the pace to conquer a\nnumber of larger ones \u2013 Madame Bovary, White Teeth,\nand Moby Dick. But the organised nature it takes on\nslightly disconcerts: as if some huge reading counter floats around in my head, and it becomes another\nthings to quantify, sand down, perfect, for what should\nbe an enjoyable activity.\nA segue. In a conversation the other day about tastes\nin books and the reasons for reading, two things came\nto me. First, I need to incorporate some lighter material\ninto my palette: to this end, I will be taking to some more\ncasual book recommendations. But there was a solid solemnity that had built up over the years in my approach\nto reading.\nIt\u2019s not that I have reasons for reading different to\nmost people. I do have the same reasons of enjoyment,\nenlightenment, fascination, entertainment, the list\nwraps around itself. I have viewed books through the\nparticular symbolism of boundary stones parting\nour lives in its stages, reflecting our thought, at-titudes, and otherwise growth in the world.\nBut university and coursework\ndemands test such a view. At\nthe current pace of life, I find there\u2019s\nmore to put my mind to than s i t t i n g\ndown to read a single book for hours.\nAssessments. Commitments. Emails, and\nthe angst of them. To equate read- ing to items\nin this list feels not only like a be- trayal, but\nalso turns reading into yet another task to do.\nHence, audiobooks. A great way to catch up on\nreading on-the-go, while grocery shopping, or\nstalling time in between lectures. Perfect while\nmultitasking, and to have on in the background\nwhile doing some cleaning. Andifithappens\nthat the Tube is too crowd- ed to have a book\nopen in hand, audiobooks are the perfect\nconvenience. This was not sponsored by\nAudible.\nHowever, despite its solutions, and\nthe rise of similar services of sub-scription-based au- diobook platforms\nin recent years, it seems that there still\nexists a void creat- ed by the joys of handling\npaperback.\nMoreover, I consider audiobooks more\nof an alterna- tive than a true solution to\nthe problem of scheduling reading time.\nAudiobooks exist as somewhat antithetical\nto the read- ing experience. I evidently regard\nreading as a private pursuit, where transferred ideas\nconfront the reader \u2013 beliefs, tendencies to scribble, the\ntides of being put down, shut, and thrown away \u2013 by actively reading someone else\u2019s words in their own voice.\nAs your own words. Audiobooks carry a sort of sensa-tion, by nature of their novelty \u2013 being able to listen to\ngreat novels dictated by celebrities, or having\nthe power to speed up or slow down audio\nexplicitly based on the \u2018Hours Left\u2019.\nHowever, at the end of the day, it\u2019s all\nkiwis and pomegranates. What it really comes\ndown to is creating the time, atmosphere, and place\nfor my style of reading, and being at peace with I\ncan or can\u2019t read. University takes up time, it\u2019s the\ntruth \u2013 and one not worth denying.\nAnd so if you\u2019re finding it hard to get in the\npages, or haven\u2019t had the chance to read anything non-academic this term, don\u2019t be hard\non yourself! It\u2019s never too late to \u201ccome as you\nare,\u201d to make those little steps of progress towards your reading goals. Far from being just\nabout self-interest, it feels as if reading is an act\nof service towards others, from wanting to see\nnew perspectives; I find calling it an activity\nwith a sense of underlying kinship helps me to\nbe where I want to be with it.\nI\u2019ve started slow \u2013 purchasing (or using credits for) predominantly non-fiction. And it\nmight be that I branch out to my first fiction\naudiobook (hopefully, a comedy \u2013 I mean it,\nI need the recommendations) soon. But I\nhave started to appreciate audiobooks for\nwhat they are and for what they\u2019re worth:\nthe ease of being able to listen to books.\nSo this week\u2019s news: asides from forgetting to celebrate World Book Day on Felix\n(!), I have started listening to audiobooks.\nAudiobooks, awkward\nskims, and hanging in there\nBOOKS\nThis week in Books: audiobooks, and a goodbye to the Spring Term.\nAudiobooksEditor\nFIYINFOLUWA T. OLADIPO\nBeliefs, tendencies to\nscribble, the tides of being\nput down, shut, and thrown\naway.\n\u201c\nUnsplash\n\n"

It acknowledges the natural\nvariation in human brains and cognitive\nstyles, encompassing a range of neurological differences such as autism,\nADHD, dyslexia, dyspraxia, and Tourette\nsyndrome, among others. Neurodivergent individuals may face various challenges in society, but they also possess\nunique strengths and perspectives that\nenrich our world.\nIt is estimated that 15-20% of the\nworld\u2019s population exhibits some form\nof neurodivergence. These conditions,\nincluding ADHD and autism spectrum\ndisorder (ASD), are overrepresented in\nSTEM fields. Unfortunately, neurodiver-gent individuals often face significant\noccupational exclusion. Only 22% of\nAutistic people in the UK are employed,\ncompared to a disability average of 53%\nand an abled average of 83%. One study\nby Student Beans found that 25% of neu-rodivergent students agreed that their\nneurodivergence impacts the way they\nstudy or revise.\nUntil now, neurodiversity at Imperial\nhas been somewhat hidden. The Disability Advisory Service (DAS) has been\nthe primary point of contact for neu-rodivergent students, focusing mainly\non the challenges associated with neu-rodivergence. Although DAS provides\nincredible support for thousands of stu-dents, the service rarely focuses on the\npositives of being neurodivergent. The\nNeurodiversity Society is intended to be a\ncelebration of Imperial\u2019s neurodivergent\nstudent population.\nThe society\u2019s mission extends beyond\nproviding a safe space for neurodivergent\nindividuals, including those with formal\nand self-diagnoses. It aims to educate\nboth neurotypical and neurodivergent\nindividuals about neurodivergent issues,\nraise awareness of these issues at Imperial, and advocate for policy changes. The\nsociety also supports neurodivergent individuals who may be experiencing difficulties due to their neurodivergence and\nthose who believe they may be neurodi-vergent through the diagnosis process.\nThe society has an exciting lineup of\nevents planned for this term to honour\nNeurodiversity Celebration Week, a global initiative that aims to transform how\nneurodivergent individuals are perceived\nand supported by schools, universities,\nand organisations. The week is dedicated\nto promoting acceptance, providing ed-ucation, and celebrating the talents and\nstrengths of neurodivergent individuals.\nBy creating more inclusive and equitable\ncultures, it highlights the many advantages of being neurodivergent and empowers every individual. Ultimately, the\ngoal is to change the narrative and help\nthe world understand, value, and celebrate neurodiverse minds.\nTo achieve this, the Neurodiversity\nSociety has an exciting array of events\nplanned between Monday 18th March\nand Sunday 24th March. On Wednesday 20th March, they will launch their\nSiblings Scheme, where neurodivergent\nindividuals are grouped to facilitate engagement and integration within the\nsociety. To celebrate the launch, the society will host its first PowerPoint Night,\nwhere individuals give presentations\nabout their special interests in a safe\nand fun environment. There will also\nbe a panel discussion on Thursday 21st\nMarch, where speakers from Neurodiversity Society and Able@Imperial (Imperial\u2019s staff disabilities network) will share\ntheir experiences and insights into being\nneurodivergent. Throughout the week,\na book stand promoting neurodivergent\nliterature will be displayed in Abdus\nSalam Library.\nStudents can join the Neurodiversity Society on the Union website, follow\nthem on Instagram @icneurodiversity-soc, or visit their linktree at https://linktr.\nee/imperial_ndsoc. The society will also\nbe recruiting more committee members\nin the Summer Elections to help it grow.\nThe Neurodiversity Society at Imperial College Union is a significant step\ntowards acknowledging and celebrating\nneurodiversity. It provides a platform\nfor neurodivergent students to connect,\nlearn, and advocate for change. Whether you\u2019re neurodivergent or not, getting\ninvolved in the society is a great way to\ncontribute to a more inclusive and understanding community at Imperial.\nCelebrating\nNeurodiversity: The\nRise of Imperial College\nUnion\u2019s Neurodiversity\nSociety\nSocietiesWriter\nJORDAN ELLIOTT\nNeurodiversity Society\u2019s Logo /\nJordan Elliott\nAs Neurodiversity Celebration Week approaches,\nwe take a look at the new groundbreaking Neurodiversity Society\nSocietiesWriter\nSCARLETT KILFORD\n\n"

Imperial students\nare swamped with follow requests from campaign\naccounts and Instagram stories endorsing one candidate\nor another.\nBeneath the spectacle though, an important process\nis at work. Imperial College Union\u2019s (ICU) Leadership\nElections determine which students run clubs, societies,\nand projects (CSPs), and the Union itself.\nThey are the most prominent set of events in ICU\u2019s\ncalendar each year, and over the course of several years,\ncan shape the student experience significantly.\nUp for grabs are positions in the Union\u2019s Officer\nTrustee team (a group of five students who take a year\nout of their studies to lead ICU as paid employees); roles\nin the Union\u2019s representation network, which consists of\nover 600 elected student representatives; and committee\npositions for ICU\u2019s 400 or so CSPs.\nThe elections are a test not only of the candidates\nstanding for office, but also ICU itself. Election turnout\ncan be viewed as a bellwether of student engagement\nwith the Union.\nIn 2023, the most recent year for which figures are\navailable, 30.4% of eligible students voted (see chart\n1). Since 2012, turnout in ICU\u2019s elections has fallen by a\nquarter, but still remains well above national levels.\nLast academic year, the National Union of Students\n(NUS), a consortium of UK-based student unions\nexcluding ICU, surveyed 76 of its members. It reported\nthatunionswith10,000to20,000students\u2013comparable\nto ICU \u2013 achieved an average turnout of 12.7%.\nICUelectionfiguresshowthatundergraduatestudents\nare far more engaged with the Union than postgraduates\n(seechart2).Undergraduatesarethreetofourtimesmore\nlikely to vote in the elections than postgrads, despite\nrepresenting roughly equal proportions of the student\npopulation.\nThis has undoubtedly had its impact on Union\npolitics. Nine of the past ten Union Presidents at ICU\nwere undergraduate students before being elected to\nthe role, and for the most part, made little mention of\npostgraduates in their manifesto pledges.\nOther universities such as UCL have a full-time\nsabbatical officer dedicated to addressing the needs of\npostgraduates. At Imperial, a volunteer-run Graduate\nStudent Union (GSU) once existed, but was scrapped in\n2022 by the only Union President in the past ten years to\nhave been a postgrad themselves.\n\u2018The difference between UG and PG engagement\nand satisfaction with the Union, across a wide range of\nmetrics, is stark \u2013 and unacceptable,\u2019 wrote then-Union\nPresident Lloyd James , supporting calls for a new system\nfrom a student-led working group. He said the GSU had\n\u2018a mixed track record\u2019 but had \u2018not achieved a significant\noverall level of impact on the PG experience\u2019.\nThe GSU was disbanded and its functions subsumed\ninto the central Union, with new postgraduate\nrepresentative positions created. Under the new system,\nresponsibility for postgraduates ultimately lies with two\nsabbatical officers, the Deputy President (Education) and\nDeputy President (Welfare).\nLast year\u2019s election turnout figures show that much\nremains to be done in order to engage postgraduates.\nPromisingly though, this year\u2019s Deputy President\n(Education), Yi Yang, says she has made postgraduate\nengagement one of her priorities, and has met with\nstudents and staff to initiate change.\nThe undergrad-postgrad disparity rears its head\nin peculiar ways when the\nWhat ICU's\nLeadership\nElections tell us\nabout the student\nunion\nEditor-in-Chief\nJAMIE JOHN Postgraduate engagement is low...\nTurnout is declining, but still\nbeats other student unions\naround the country. Unions of a\ncomparable size to ICU had an\naverage turnout of 12.7% in 2023.\nREAD MORE ON 6\n1\n2 3\n4\n\n"

Perhaps a better definition of what severe pain\nsymptoms are would be beneficial\nin addition to the empirical data the\nregulatory body requires.\nMany scientists have warned of\nthe ill effects of unwanted genetic\nmutations caused by CRIPSR based\ntherapies.

But we know from other\nstudies, including ours, that these\noff-target effects occur genome\nwide, and there\u2019s been lots of development in detections of these\noff-target effects\u201d.\nThere are many different sequencing pipelines that can characterise off-target effects that\ndon\u2019t happen often.

Scientists have\ntaken cryo-EM and X-ray crystallography structures of these Cas9 and\nCRISPR effectors in the presence of\nDNA which have on and off targets.\nThey rationally design and create\nmutations between these proteins\nto create new high-fidelity variants\nwhich exhibit fewer off-target effects to the ones that they observe\nwith the wild type variants.\u201d\n\u201cThis is the main way in which\nthey create high-fidelity variance,\nbut there are other ways as well. You\ncan use directed evolution, where\nyou evolve higher fidelity variants\nof Cas9 using a screening assay.\nSniper-Cas9, a high-fidelity variant of Cas9, was created using an E.\ncoli-based directed evolution meth-od. So, it\u2019s mainly through structural biology or directed evolution\nmethods.\u201d\nWhile CRISPR-Cas9 is the most\nwidely publicised method of gene\nediting in today\u2019s world, there are\nalso other mechanisms of gene\nediting that exist. However, even\nthough these other techniques of\nmanipulating the genome exist,\nCRIPSR remains the dominating\ntechnique. As Quentin explains,\n\u201czinc-finger nucleases and TALENs\nare both alternative gene editing\ntechniques that work on similar ar-chitecture. They have DNA binding\ndoamins that recognise and bind to\nDNA and a Fok1 nuclease domain\nthat cleaves DNA. However, Cas9\nis quite superior because it uses an\nRNA guide, so you can work directly with complementarity between\nDNA and RNA.\u201d\nAs Quentin makes very\nclear, therapies such as Casgevy hold great promise, and\nthe work on mitigating any\nill effects these therapies\nmay cause means that the\nroad looks only smooth\nfrom here on.\npy allows the ability for you to cure\nmany common and very rare genetic diseases.\u201d\nThe main downside of Casgevy\nare the off-target unwanted genetic mutations it may cause.

This was the first\ndrug based on CRISPR technology to be licensed for use\nin humans. In Felix issue 1844 on 1st\nMarch 2024, we covered Casgevy and the promise it poses.\nThis week Felix sat down with Quentin Smith, a final\nyear PhD student at Imperial working in Prof. David\nRueda\u2019s lab at the MRC Laboratory of Medical Sciences\n(LMS). Quentin\u2019s research aims to understand genetic\nengineering technologies in greater detail and their implications in health and disease.\nHis research focuses on CRISPR-Cas9 and how it discriminates between on and off-targets.\nEver since it was engineered in 2012 by Jennifer\nDoudna and Emmanualle Charpentier, whose work\nearned them the 2020 Nobel Prize, Cas9 has always offered great promise in genome editing and the potential\nto cure genetic diseases. However, up until now, using\nCRIPSR-Cas9 in medicines has been too dangerous because it often causes off-target effects, where Cas9 binds\nand cuts DNA elsewhere than the desired locus. This\nundesirable cleavage can cause mutations and diseases\nworse than the original condition being treated.\nQuentin Smith told Felix that his research \u201celucidates\nthe molecular basis of why this occurs and provides\nrational on how to generate high-fidelity variants that\nmitigate this.\u201d\nResearchers not involved with the study have raised\nconcerns that the trial of only 29 people, was not large\nenough to justify the licensing of the new technology.\nSmith, however, explained that \u201cthe amount of people\nwho were treated and free from severe pain was quite\nstark - in the upper 90 percent range, which is rare to\nsee and may have led to the approval being granted.\u201d\nSickle cell and \u03b2-thalassemia are inherited blood dis-orders. Persons affected with these disorders produce\nlittle to no haemoglobin, a part of the blood that carries\noxygen around the body.\nCasegevy is a medicine proposed to treat blood disorders in the body. It works by reducing the number of\nsickle cells in the body to a negligible amount.\nThe drug itself is an ex-vivo treatment that uses CRISPR-Cas9. Clinicians extract stem cells from sufferers of\nsickle cell anaemia and \u03b2-thalassemia. These stem cells\nare then cultured and transfected with Cas9 that targets the BC11A gene that codes for foetal haemoglobin.\nThese cells are then reintroduced into the patient\u2019s body\nthrough intravenous infusion to allow them to grow\nand differentiate and express the corrected gene. Going\nslightly more into the nuances of the therapy, Quentin\nexplained that the logic behind the genetic edits being\nmade only to a few cells that are reintroduced and not to\nall cells present.\n\u201cThe idea is that the transfected cells proliferate and\ndivide and outlast the diseased cells, gradually replacing them.\u201d\nAn important point to note in the approval of this\ndrug, barring the fact that it is the first of its kind, is the\ndata on which it was approved. Despite clinical trials\nhaving a high success rate, it has only ever been performed on less than 50 people. Many deem this to be\ninsufficient and question whether it should have been\ngranted approval on the basis of such a small study.\nQuentin commented that, \u201cI agree that the numbers are\nquite low for clinical trials. I believe Casgevy is in trial\nphase three, which means they should have anywhere\nbetween 300-3000 people according to the Food and\nExploring CRISPR-Cas9\u2019s\nbreakthrough genetic therapy\nSCIENCE\nFelix interviews\nImperial PhD student,\nQuentin Smith,\non CRISPR-Cas9\u2019s\ntherapeutic potential\nand the significance of\nCasgevy approval.\nQuentin Smith, a PhD student working in Prof. David Rueda\u2019s lab at the MRC Laboratory. He works on CRISPR Cas systems, which has\nbeen used to create a GFP-transcription factor fusion protein. T. Macfarlane, National Institute of Child Health and Human Development\nCas9 poses great promise in\ngenome editing and curing\ngenetic diseases.\n\u201c\nScienceWriter\nTEJAS GUPTA\n\n"

Then I feel\nsomething fluffy between my knees, I look\ndown, and it\u2019s a mouse right there!\u2019\n\u2018I jump and yell, my friends start yelling,\nmeanwhile the mouse runs away, jumps\ninto my friend\u2019s coat\u2026 and then vanishes\ninto thin air.\u2019\nOther mouse sightings have been\nreported in the Abdus Salam Library,\nSenior Common Room, Sir Alexander\nFleming Building, and Imperial College\nBusiness School. Rodents have also been\nseen in College-run student residences,\nincluding Beit and Wilson Halls.\n\u2018To be honest, I don\u2019t fully blame the\nCollege for this one,\u2019 said one EEE student,\nspeaking specifically in relation to the\nLibrary Caf\u00e9, which he said turned into \u2018a\ncomplete pigsty\u2019 at night.\n\u2018The caf\u00e9 space is open 24 hours, and\nafter the staff go home, that place can\nbecome a disgraceful mess in a few hours.\nDirty tables, food, and scraps on the\nfloor, just an incredible display of people\ncompletely disregarding the basic courtesy\nof cleaning up after themselves.\u2019\nHe alleged that students \u2018throw rubbish\non the floor\u2019 rather than in bins.\n\u2018I\u2019ve seen mice chewing through bags of\ndeliveryordersleftonthefloor\u2026it\u2019salmost\nnosurprisetheplaceisfullofmiceifpeople\nkeep making it such a great place to live.\u2019\nBetween 2017/18 and 2021/22, the\nCollege spent \u00a3848,160 on pest control\nservices, according to its response to a\nFreedom of Information request.\nThe spokesperson for ICU said: \u2018At the\nUnion, we take the well-being and safety\nof our spaces and venues seriously, and\nthat includes addressing any concerns\nregarding pest control promptly and\neffectively.\n'We understand recent reports of\nrodent sightings have raised concerns,\nand we want to assure our community that\nproactive measures are in place to address\nany reported issues comprehensively.\u2019\nImperial did not respond to requests for\ncomment, but Felix understands that the\nEstates team is aware of and working to\nresolve the ongoing pest problems.\nAdditional reporting by Jamie John.\nFor more mouse pics and videos, follow us on\nInstagram (@felix_imperial). Go on, we know\nyou want to.\nNEWS\nU\nnion Council will vote next Tuesday\non a motion calling for Imperial to\nseek more feedback on its new logo\nbefore proceeding any further with its\nrollout.\nThe motion argues that Imperial\u2019s\nefforts to solicit feedback on its logo\n\u2018were not effectively [or] sufficiently\nadvertised,\u2019 and that \u2018without pushback\nfrom the Union,\u2019 the university is\n\u2018unlikely\u2019 to solicit or apply any new\nfeedback.\nImperial has faced widespread\ncriticism after unveiling its new logo\nas part of a wider rebranding project.\nA change.org petition calling for its\nreplacement has gained nearly 8,000\nsignatures, and the university\u2019s social\nmedia posts have been flooded with\ncomments ridiculing the new design.\nIf voted through, next week\u2019s motion\nwill mandate Union President Camille\nBoutrolle to lobby Imperial\u2019s brand team\nto \u2018openly address the criticism of the\nnew logo\u2019 and \u2018improve engagement and\nfeedback collection methods\u2019.\nResponding to the criticism last\nmonth, Imperial\u2019s brand project team\nsaid that it would \u2018take any opportunity\nto hear what people think, to listen, and\nto answer questions.\u2019\nThe team said it provided project\nupdates in a video, on its website, and\nthrough a series of emails. However,\nstudents and staff say they were not\naware of the new logo until last week,\nbecause none of the emails explicitly\nmentioned the logo or contained images\nof the changes.\n\u2018Students feel unheard due to a lack of\nacknowledgement of the pushback,\u2019 says\nthe Union Council motion. \u2018Imperial not\naddressing the wave of negative feedback\nis likely to have a lasting negative impact\non students\u2019 trust in [the university]\u2019.\nA brand project spokesperson said that\nthe new brand \u2018articulate[s] Imperial\u2019s\npurpose and vision, our strengths and\nimpact, while seeking to differentiate us\nin a crowded and competitive landscape.\u2019\nUnion Council to vote on\nImperial logo motion next week\nEditor-in-Chief\nJAMIE JOHN\nThe new logo on the facade of the City & Guilds Building in South Kensington.
