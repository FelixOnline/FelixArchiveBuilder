    "content": "Tips & Hacks\nBring on some Raspberry Pi\nWhile we were all busy watching the Union Elections Hustings, it turns out Apple was simultaneously revealing \u201cthe new iPad\u201d. That\u2019s right \u2013 at\nthe time of going to print there is no mention of\nthe official name of Apple\u2019s new tablet. Both iPad\n3 and iPad HD have been touted, but the speakers\nconsistently referred to the latest device as \u201cthe/\nthis new iPad\u201d. Strange, but on to the actual thing\nitself. Some of the rumours did come true, with\nthe new iPad sporting a retina display weighing\nin at 2048 x 1536 (that\u2019s 3.1 million pixels), and\na better camera that now allows you to record in\nfull HD. Other specifications include a quad-core\nA5X chip, 4G compatibility (which is perhaps more\nexciting for our American cousins), and ten hours\nof battery life (nine if using 4G). Interestingly, the\niPad 2 will remain on sale, but at $100 cheaper\n\u2013 further out-pricing the tablet\u2019s struggling com-petitors. In other news, Apple also announced the\nnew Apple TV, supporting 1080p and featuring a\nslicker interface, but no word of an Apple smart\nTV.\nT\nhe web is changing. Sites such as\nFacebook and Twitter keep you\nhooked by constantly updating in\nreal-time any activity that happens in your social network. This\nis incredibly powerful and last year the Union\nused this to create the incredibly successful re-al-time voting statistics page. Along with a lot\nof people, I was glued to the page during election week, transfixed by the moving bars and\nanimated numbers that were constantly changing as students placed their votes. Technically\nhowever, it was a far from perfect system that\ncaused the entire union server to grind to a halt.\nThis year Paul Beaumont came to me with the\nsuggestion that I have a go at improving it, and\nI would like to share some thoughts on how the\ntechnology behind the new system is shaping\ntoday\u2019s world wide web.\nTraditionally, websites have been a very\nsimple affair. Servers, essentially large com-puters, sit in some dark damp basement waiting for someone to browse to the site that they\nhost and, when this happy event occurs, present to the browser all the information that it\nneeds to display the site. Once this is finished\nthe relationship between the browser and the\nserver ends until the browser navigates to another page. This system works very well and\nis all that static websites, such as Wikipedia,\nBBC News and Felix Online, need. However\nweb developers wanted more. They wanted\nwebsites to be more dynamic. They wanted the\nwebsite to update with new content without users having to continually click the refresh but-ton. In short they didn\u2019t want the relationship\nbetween browser and server to end once the\nsite is displayed.\nOne solution is to use JavaScript. JavaScript\nis a scripting language that all modern browsers support and is almost universally used to\nprovide a more interactive and dynamic experience for users. It can also be used to fetch\ninformation from the server through a group of\ntechnologies collectively called AJAX. This allowed developers to fake a real-time connection\nby making a browser regularly ask the server\nfor new information and so keep the page up\nto date without refreshing. This is the system\nthat the previous elections stats website used,\nand although it works it has its problems. First\nof all it doesn\u2019t change anything about how the\nserver is operating since the JavaScript is simply doing what an overzealous user could be\ndoing by refreshing the page manually all the\ntime. Secondly it can result in lots of unnecessary requests as the data may not have changed\nsince the last request. Finally, and more practi-cally, once this is set up the developer has no\ncontrol about when the user will request this\ndata and so with a large enough active users,\nrequests will come in all the time. This can be\nThe power behind the web\nFELIX\nFriday 09 march 2012\n10\ntechnology.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nTechnology Editors: Chris Bowers\nFeroz Salam\nTECHNOLOGY\ngot this far then you probably want to know\nhow it was done). We are using some cutting\nedge technologies that make it even easier to\nimplement real-time connections \u2013 specifically\nNode.js and Socket.io. Node.js is a new server\nside platform that runs JavaScript on the server\nusing Google\u2019s V8 runtime engine (it powers\nChrome) and it is blazing fast! It is completely\nasynchronous, lightweight and currently the\ndarling of the web development community. I\ncould go into Node.js a lot more, but that will\nhave to be a topic for another article. Socket.\nio is where the magic happens. As it states on\nits website \u201cIt\u2019s care-free real-time 100% in JavaScript\u201d. Since WebSockets aren\u2019t supported\nby all browsers (I\u2019m looking at you Internet\nExplorer) to enable real-time communication\nwe need to fall back to older technologies.\nSocket.io does this all for us by supporting all\nbrowsers from IE 5.5 onwards, while giving a\nconsistent development interface. Essentially it\nlets us forget about trying to support old browsers and just concentrate on writing cool appli-cations. Together, Node.js and Socket.io, allow\nus to very quickly implement an interactive\nand real-time experience for the Union stats.\nAs a small test of how it all might work, a\nsmall box was added to the sidebar that shows\nhow many candidates are standing and how\nmany seconders there are. This is updated (us-ing Node.js and Socket.io) every second and so\nfar everything seems to be running smoothly!\nAt all times the server, not the browser, is in\ncontrol of how often the statistics are updated\nand this means that there is only one request\nat a time (from the server) as opposed to multiple requests from different browsers. In the\nunlikely event that the server is overloaded, I\ncan dive in and change the frequency at which\nit updates to prevent a recurrence of last year\u2019s\ncrash.\nWebSockets, and the advent of the real-time\nweb, are a fundamental change in how the web\nworks. Instead of sites being static and entirely\ndependant on user interaction to update, they\ncan now just sit there and new information is\nfed directly to them. It makes things like online chat trivial and sites such as Facebook and\nTwitter even more addictive. I\u2019m sure you will\nsee what I mean when the stats page launches!\nApple announce... \u201cthe new iPad\u201d\nEagerly awaited and extensively promoted, the\nRaspberry Pi debuted at the end of last week to a\nmassive response that sent sales websites crash-ing. Priced at \u00a322 and targeted at children learning to program, the Pi runs a Linux OS on an ARM\nchip. It provides users with the ability to plug in a\nmonitor, keyboard and mouse and get going. Considerably cheaper than any competing device on\nthe market, the Pi makes its savings by reducing\naesthetic appeal in favour of bare bone features.\nWhether the Pi will actual get children programming is another question, however. Despite the\nwidely reported low price, users will still need the\naforementioned monitor, keyboard and mouse to\nget started; a decent monitor will probably cost\nmany times more than the card itself. Even assuming the use of a family monitor, the device\nalone seems quite dull. The eventual success of\nthe chip will depend upon developing programming software that makes development attractive\nto kids. Programs such as \u2018Ruby for Kids\u2019 (which\nis intended to go on the Pi) are exactly the sort of\nthing the Pi developers should look for; the trick in\ngetting children using the device will not lie in the\nhardware, but in slick software that drags perception of computing away from Excel spreadsheets\nand towards the grand designs of Skyrim or Grand\nTheft Auto.\nJonathan Kim discusses the election site\u2019s technologies\nincredibly taxing for a server as it will need to\ndeal with all these requests one at a time and\nit can amount to the same effect as a Denial of\nService Attack which is usually employed by\nhackers wanting to overload a website so it can\nlonger function (groups such as Anonymous\nuse this type of attack to bring down large corporate websites). This can be further exacerbated if the information that is being requested is\ncomplex and takes time to generate, which was\nthe case for the elections stats last year and the\nreason it brought the union server to its knees.\nObviously simply using AJAX is not a good\nsolution in the long term and so we had to turn\nto new technologies to implement a true realtime connection between the browser and serv-er. One such technology is called WebSocket.\nWebSockets allow a server and a browser to\nopen up a persistent connection through which\ninformation can be sent by either party. This\nallows the server to push information to all\nbrowsers whenever there is a change as opposed to browsers constantly asking for new\ninformation. Through this method the server\ncontrols the rate at which users receive new\ninformation.\nNow to be a bit more technical (if you\u2019ve\n\u201c...it lets us forget about\nolder browsers (I\u2019m looking at you Internet Explorer)\u201d\nPrepare to see some funky stuff going on at the stats page\n\n"

    "content": "A\ns the \u201cArab Spring\u201d un-folded, many Syrians\nlooked on with envy,\nhoping for a chance\nto ride the waves of\nchange. Yet, after a few failed attempts \u2013 the first being on February 5\n2011 \u2013 many had lost hope. However,\nno one had envisioned the regime itself providing the spark for the revo-lution.\nSyria\u2019s regime has long been known\nfor its ruthlessness and brutality, and\nits people for their calm and peaceful\nnature. However, the Assad regime\ncrossed a line on February 27, which\ndestroyed the fear barrier in many Syrians. Twenty primary school children\nhad been arrested and tortured for\nwriting anti-government graffiti on the\nschool building. When an attempt to\nfree their children resulted in the humiliation of the parents by the mayor,\nprotests erupted in the city with the\nchant \u201cdeath rather than humiliation\u201d\nechoing loud in the protests. The regime tried to use brute force to bring\nback order, but all that did was cause\nanger among Syrians and start coun-trywide protests.\nFor the past year the Syrian revolution has defied all the odds. Many had\npredicted its demise very early on, but\nit seemed that the more force the regime used, the more determined the\npeople became. Every attack by the\nregime led to more areas joining the\nrevolution. Every death led to a funer-al-turned-protest.\nThe regime intensified its operations\nto crackdown on the freedom move-ment. Deraa, the suburbs of Damascus,\nIdlib, Hama and the coastal cities all\nfaced heavy military operations. The\nregime closed off these cities, causing\nshortages in water, food, electricity,\nand fuel, and systematically detained\nand tortured the citizens, in an attempt\nto force the people into submission.\nBut all that was nothing compared to\nwhat Homs went through. The city\nwas systematically bombed using\nartillery shells and multiple missile\nlaunchers; the water, electricity, food,\nfuel, and communications were totally\ncut off and the army drove people out\nof their homes to use them as sniper\ndens.\nHospitals became slaughter houses\n\u2013 injured protesters faced torture and\neven death in hospitals, which led to\nthe formation of field hospitals \u2013 makeshift clinics where doctors treated patients with rudimentary equipment. It\nbecame a crime to carry medication,\nblood bags or medical equipment \u2013 an\nattempt by the regime to eradicate any\nkind of opposition it faced. However,\nthis was far from sucessful. Jacques\nBeres, one of the founders of MSF,\nvisited one of the field hospitals in\nHoms and was surprised at the amount\nof work done with the few tools available to the doctors.\nThe regime tried to adopt certain\nreforms to reduce the intensity of the\nprotest movement and reduce pressure\non it. However many people saw these\nreforms as too little too late, most\nnever meeting the demands of the\npeople. The new constitution would\nhave been very well received if it had\nbeen brought in at the beginning of\nthe revolution. However, the regime\nbegan by accusing the protesters of\nbeing conspirers, American opera-tives, Mossad operatives or al-Qaeda\nextremists, among many others. It attacked the protests and incarcerated\nmany activists as it looked to quell the\nrebellion.\nWhen that failed, the regime tried\ndeclaring an amnesty but firstly many\nof those detained during the revolution were excluded. Anyway, by the\ntime the amnesty came protestors had\nchanged their demands from asking\nfor freedom to asking for the fall of\nthe regime.\nFinally, the regime tried to pass off\nthe new constitution as a very worthwhile and forward reform. To be honest I wasted my time reading the full\nconstitution. It began by lining out\nall the rights of the citizens and the\nDulce et Decorum est\nHoms\u2019 latest celebrities: Though low in numbers, armed rebels are high in popularity\nGot something to say?\nSend your articles to\npolitics.felix@ic.ac.uk\nresponsibilities of the government towards its citizens. Anyone reading it\nwould have assumed they were reading a constitution of a country that\nfully respected human rights, not one\nthat at the same moment was carrying\nout mass atrocities across the coun-try. That aside, there were many other\nsmall laws that caused people to have\nmany objections to the constitution.\nExamples of these include: giving the\npresident two seven year periods in\noffice that don\u2019t include any previous\ntime in office, meaning that Bashar\nwill be in office until 2028, knowing how the election process will be.\nSecondly, it gave parliamentarians\nimmunity from law as well as giving\nthem the right to offer people an amnesty from any previously committed\ncrimes. Many thought that this will\njust lead to the same situation as we\nhave now, where people can do whatever they like without fearing any\nrepercussions. However, the biggest\nand most fundamental flaw was the\nfact that on the day of the referendum,\nPOLITICS\nFELIX Friday 09 MARCH 2012 11\nBasel Chamali argues that there is no peaceful solution in Syria\nHoms, Hama and Idlib were heavily attacked and their citizens did not\nvote. Regardless of the outcome, the\nflaws of the constitution and the time\nit came at made many Syrians reject\nit out right.\nAnother possible way out was suggested by Tunisia: give Bashar AlAssad immunity and allow him to\nseek refuge in Tunisia and so stop\nthe bloodshed in Syria. This plan\nhas many flaws. Firstly, the regime\nis not only Bashar; taking him out\nof the equation will bring his brother\nor some other family member in to\nfill his place and the situation won\u2019t\nchange. This family regime has been\nin place since 1970, a change to the\nfigurehead will do little to change the\nway it is run. The only way to effectively change the current situation will\nbe to completely uproot the regime.\nThat aside, many Syrians, myself in-cluded, would not accept this suggestion to end the conflict. It is an insult\nto the thousands who lost their lives\nand others who were affected by the\nbrutality of the regime. I don\u2019t think\nmany Syrians can bring themselves\nto tell these people, especially the orphans who lost their parents, that their\nsacrifices were in vain as we have decided to let the culprit go free.\nFinally, militarisation, although con-troversial, is something that many Syrians agree on. The revolution began as\na peaceful movement to gain freedom\nfrom an autocratic, dictatorial and oppressive regime. However, people can\nonly take so much, and after months\nof vicious and inhumane attacks on civilians and after seeing whole families\nslaughtered for opposing the regime,\npeople began losing hope in a peaceful resolution and decided to take the\narmed route. It began with army defectors creating brigades to defend the\ncivilians against the attacks from the\nregime. Now it has spread to normal\ncivilians. These freedom fighters are\nfunded by donations from Syrians\nand other friends outside Syria and\nbuy weaponry one or two rifles at a\ntime, which then have to be smuggled\ninto Syria through the border. However, despite all these restrictions and\nlimitations, they have become a formidable force in many cities that the\nregime\u2019s forces fear. Take Homs as an\nexample. It is well controlled by the\nrebels- the army forces bombard the\ncity from a distance but can hardly\nmake their way into the city without\nfearing an attack that will eliminate\nmore than half of the group.\nPersonally, I feel that the only salvation is by force. The regime knows\nthat it has no way out and is fighting to\nthe last man, so it would be delusional\nof us to think that at some point they\nwill rethink their strategy. They will\ncontinue to kill and their methods and\nmanner will only intensify. The freedom fighters are growing in numbers\nand strength by the day; they were able\nto hold off the regime\u2019s attack on Baba\nAmr for around a month, protect the\njournalists in Homs, and even smuggle them out to safety, which is much\nmore than can be said for their respective governments. These fighters have\nno fear \u2013 talking to them fills me with\nhope as I see their determination and\nstrength. Whenever an alternative solution is suggested their response is to\nrefuse. Their goal is to eradicate the\nregime that for years has done nothing\nbut kill, torture and abuse Syrians.\nRegardless of what route the revolution takes or how long it lasts, one\nthing is for certain: Syrians have decided on their goal. This regime will\nlose this battle; it\u2019s but a matter of\ntime. The question remains however:\nhow many Syrians are willing to still\nstand by it as it kills their fellow broth-ers?\n\u201cThe only salvation is\nby force. The regime\nknows it has no way\nout.\u201d\nPolitics Editors: Rajat Jain\nJoseph Letts\npolitics.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n\n"

Nothing says welcome more\nthan running through training drills,\nsparring and demonstrating your \u201cKiai\u201d\n(war cry used to both intimidate/domi-nate the opponent & psyche up your-self) to your opponent. Well, nothing\nexcept for a few rounds of drinks after-wards. However, this was only a small\nglimpse of \ufb01ne Kendo. The main event\nwas still to come.\nThat following Saturday the students\nfrom Tokyo were greeted by a much\nlarger crowd with members from do-jos around and outside London making\na total of 60 \u201ckend\u014dka\u201d (person who\npractises kendo) on the day. The day\nbegan with a performance by ChidaSenpai himself and one of his students.\nThe demonstration was of an ancient\nform of \u201ckata\u201d (the essence of Japanese swordsmanship linking modern-day kendo to the teachings of the many\nearly kenjutsu schools) passed down\nthrough generations of pupils from the\njikishinkage-ry\u016b school of combative\nswordsmanship founded in the mid-16th century. Each stage of the performance symbolises each of the four\nseasons, ranging from explosive and\nintense movements to represent Summer, to the more slow, reserved pace of\nWinter.\nThis was followed by the moment\nwe had all been waiting for. When we\nstrapped on our \u201cbogu\u201d (armour) and\nfought in a friendly individuals competition versus the Hitotsubashi students.\nThe traditional rules being the \ufb01rst\nplayer to score two clean hits on the\nother within a two minute match is declared the winner. After the \ufb01rst seven\nmatches we were in the lead, though\nthe students from Japan quickly turned\nthings around in the later rounds. Both\nsides fought valiantly till the end with\nthe \ufb01nal match lasting well over 10min-utes with neither side showing any sign\nof defeat.\nThe day was rounded off with an hour\nof sparring and a great social meal in\nEastside Bar with our new friends from\nthe East. After waving our \ufb01nal goodbyes we quickly wrote plans in our diaries to hopefully meet again, though this\ntime it will be on their side of the world.\n\u201c\n\u201d\nNothing says\n\u2018welcome\u2019 more than\nrunning through\ntraining drills...\nGoing at it with a Ken-do attitude\nFrom the land of the rising sun to the land of the permanent cloud\n1 2 3 4 5 5 6 7 8\n9\n10 10\n11 12 12 13\n14\n13 14 15 16\n17 18 19 19 20\n20 21 22 23 22 23\n24\n24 25 26\n26 28\n11 15\n16 17 18 19 20\n21\n22 23 24 25\n26\n19\n25\n27\n21\n18\n17\n16\n15\n\n"

    "content": "COMMENT\nFELIX Friday 09 MARCH 2012 15\nCOMMENT\nFELIX\nF\nebruary 10th\u2019s edition of Felix managed, in two articles,\nto highlight the issue of sexism at Imperial College, in\ntwo very different ways. One\nwas a straightforward, serious article on\nthe issue of sexism, while the other was\nthe (now infamous) satirical \u201cHangman\nGuide to Get Laid\u201d. Not surprisingly,\nperhaps, the reception enjoyed by these\narticles has been extremely different. But\ndespite their differences, are the overall\nviewpoints of the articles really that dis-similar?\nThe viewpoint of the first article is pretty obvious: sexism exists at Imperial, and\nit\u2019s bad. It would be pretty hard to argue\nthat sexism isn\u2019t bad, and I\u2019m not going\nto. An example was given of a group of\n\u201clads\u201d classifying women in a lecture by\ntheir looks. Such comments are certainly\nimmature and crass, but are they indicative of a deeper prejudice? That\u2019s ques-tionable. It\u2019s probably just an outlet for\nsexual frustration and a backlash against\nthe large social power that women at Imperial have. While not wanting to make it\nsound like women, or people in general,\nare commodities, supply and demand arguments do apply to romantic/sexual opportunities as well, and I\u2019ve heard groups\nof young women in female-dominated\nenvironments making similar comments\nin the past.\nRegarding the Hangman article, I wish\nto ask a simple question: what is the purpose of humour? The obvious answer is\nHangman\u2019s dark sense of humour\nthat it exists to make us laugh. But is that\nall there is to it? I don\u2019t think so. It also\nexists to challenge and provoke thought\non taboos, the establishment and our entrenched notions of society. Often, there\nis a strong sense of irony, and I would\nnote that an episode of The Simpsons\nfeatured a police officer telling road-rage\noffenders to \u201cFire a weapon at your TV\nset, pick a fight with someone weaker\nthan you, or write a threatening letter to a\ncelebrity\u201d. This is obviously ironic satire,\njust like the Hangman article, but I wonder if those objecting to Hangman also\nwant to see The Simpsons banned. Given\nits popularity, I doubt it.\nIn the case of black humour, humour\nacts as an emotional release: it serves as\na coping mechanism to dampen negative\nemotions to a horrible situation by trying\nto see a bright side, however absurd. This\nis probably why people who deal with\nthese issues every day (soldiers, police,\nundertakers, doctors etc.) are widely regarded as having a dark sense of humour.\nIf anything, by dampening negative emo-tions, black humour actually makes it\neasier to talk about issues such as rape,\nand I\u2019ve often found that people with\nsuch a sense of humour are more likely\nto be willing to discuss such issues seriously rather than burying their heads in\nthe sand and pretending that everything\nis okay with the world.\nGiven the purpose of satire and black\nhumour, I would therefore argue that\nno topic should be off-limits, as long as\nit is handled correctly. So what about\nthe controversial Hangman article? The\ncriticism that it has received seems to be\nbased on the article\u2019s perceived trivialisa-tion and encouragement of rape and the\nobjectification of women. Was that really its intention? The article described\nrohypnol as \u201canything but nice\u201d and took\na generally abusive tone to the would-be\nrapists that it was supposedly instructing,\nsuggesting quite the opposite.\nIndeed, the only part of the article that\neven comes close to promoting the use of\nrohypnol is its description as \u201cthe perfect\nmixer \u2026 for some girl who is probably\njust using you for free drinks\u201d, and this\nis such a warped and absurd description\nthat I struggle to see how anyone with\nhalf a brain could believe that it is meant\nto encourage such behaviour, particularly\ngiven the content of the rest of the article.\nQuite rightly, the article portrays the attacker as a \u201cwaste of oxygen\u201d and the\nvictim as just that \u2013 a victim, while highlighting and laughing at the absurdity of\nany justification that a rapist might try to\nuse.\nIf anything, the Hangman article has\nsucceeded in its satirical purpose by\nmaking people think about the issue\nand reminding us that yes, unfortunately\nthere are people in existence who think\nthat rape is trivial or acceptable, and\nthat these people are among the worst in\nsociety. However, I don\u2019t think that the\nwriter(s) of the article is/are among them.\nOverall, the two articles are both against\nsexism and objectification, one expressing this via argument and one via satirical\nblack humour, so the different reception\nthey received is largely unjustified.\nDisclaimer: Just to make it clear that\nthere are no vested interests at work here,\nI have no involvement with the Hangman\nsection, and this is the first piece I\u2019ve\never written for Felix. Therefore, please\nsend all your Hangman hate-mail to the\nusual address.\n...the Hangman\narticle has\nsucceeded in its\nsatirical purpose by\nmaking people think\nabout the issue\n\u201c\n...the Ha\n...the Ha\narticle h\narticle h\n\u201d\nple think\nple think\nsue\nue\nSteven Abnett\nSo it\u2019s not Hammertime, then?\nA revision of dietary laws\nO\nne of the overarching\nthemes displayed by\nthe main religions of\nthe world is a set of\ndietary restrictions. An\nexample is Islam, and its recommen-dation/order that you abstain from\nalcohol and swine. Many of these\ndietary restrictions were possibly in\nresponse to practical issues in the society in which the religion was born\ninto. It\u2019s reasonable to propose that\navoiding pork and alcohol was a very\ngood idea at the time of the birth of\nIslam because of the hazards of either\nin an arid climate: pigs rot quickly in\nthe heat and harbour salmonella while\nalcohol is a diuretic.\nIn the modern world, where water\nand refrigeration are plentiful, the rationale behind these rules of thumb\nhas been lost and you find many people following such dietary laws just\nfor the hell of it. The same goes for\nJudaism, which is even crazier about\nwhat you can and can\u2019t eat. As a fan\nof several of these forbidden goods\nbut not one to annoy God, I would\nlike to propose an alternative formalism of how these restrictions should\nbe observed.\nSeeing as every religion I know of\nis simply someone\u2019s interpretation of\nGod\u2019s words, I\u2019ve taken it upon myself to develop my own interpretation\nof these dietary laws. Intuitively, one\nwould consider the \u201csin\u201d of eating\nsomething haram or non-kosher to\nbe additive: eating a ham sandwich\nwith a beer is worse than just having a beer on its own. So beer is a -1\nagainst your name and the sandwich\nis a -1, giving you a total of -2 against\nyour case for making it into Heaven.\nInstead, I propose that in any given\ninstance these are instead multiplica-tive, so in this lunch we would have\nthe negatives cancel out and you\u2019d\ninstead get a positive answer, negating the sin (\u201cthe sin\u2019s in the sign\u201d).\nAs any usurping theory, this explains\nall the observations that the old one\ndoes (i.e. that consuming pork or beer\nsends you to Hell), but provides extra insight that can be proven or debunked (pork AND beer is okay). All\nI need to do now is to test this, by seeing if I will go to Heaven if I consume\nboth of these in tandem, or if God will\nlaugh me away from the Pearly Gates.\nNot only are the food items themselves subject to restrictions, but their\nmethod of preparation and time they\nare consumed are also factored in to\nthe religious equation. It is forbidden to eat an animal that has not been\nslaughtered in the proper manner\nmandated by the Quran: the blood is\ndrained to minimise suffering and a\nprayer said for the life of the animal\nthat is being deliciously taken. It\u2019s\nalso forbidden to eat or drink anything\nin the day during Ramadan, when one\nis supposed to empathise with those\nwho have no choice but to starve. The\ngeneral rule of my theory is that any\neven number of nutritionally based\nsins in tandem cancels out any net sin.\nWhile it is debatable whether eating\na sandwich and drinking beer afterwards is simultaneous, doing either\non its own during Ramadan surely is.\nAs with quantum mechanics, the results that the mathematics predict can\nbe counter-intuitive: it seems to be\nperfectly halal to eat pork during Ramadan, but only during the day. If the\nsun\u2019s set, you better go for chicken.\nOf course, this theory only works\nif the terms \u201cpork\u201d and \u201chalal\u201d are\nproperly defined, which is where I hit\na snag. Consider, if you will, a hypothetical pig/cow hybrid. Or a cow\ncrossed with this hybrid, to make an\nanimal only 25% pig. At what point\nis the pig DNA no longer enough to\nmake the animal porcine? Even more\nspeculatory is the halal status of an\nanimal slaughtered improperly, only\nto be re-slaughtered in a halal fashion.\nOf course, neither of these scenarios\nare currently achievable, and so my\nrefined \u201crule of thumb\u201d will hold for\nnow. I will leave it to the faithful of\nthe future to further revise it when\nthese dilemmas become practical is-sues, i.e. when the laws no longer suit\nthe circumstances.\nVeli Akiner\n\n"

Additionally,\nI have actively shown a passion in\nthe education Imperial offers by\nworking with the current DPE on\nNotebox and being involved in the\nbuddy system for the last two years.\nI am not doing this for my CV,\nas I have already secured and deferred my dream graduate job. The\nonly reason I want to be DPE is to\nimprove the quality of education at\nImperial.\nSo don\u2019t be a mug, vote for Doug!!!\nAlexander Karapetian\nF\nrom the first day I started\nat Imperial I knew I was\ngoing to dedicate myself\nto Felix. Since then, I\u2019ve\nserved the paper for three\nyears undertaking various roles including News Reporter, Photographer, Copy Editor, Web Editor, News\nEditor (2010-11) and Science Editor (2011-12). Having always had a\nkeen interest in writing and journal-ism, I\u2019ve worked hard to stay on\ntop of issues at Imperial, providing\nyou with weekly news and relevant\nfeatures.\nA vote for me is a vote for Transparency, Stability, and Professionalism. We\u2019ve been your voice since\n1949 and we need to stay true to\nthis in an open and social manner.\nIf elected, I will set up and man a\nFelix stall in the JCR every week to\ngive you a platform to approach us,\nask questions, get involved, or simply voice your criticisms.\nAs your Editor, I will bring back\nHangman and make sure Felix is\nkept humorous by introducing two\nnew subsections to it to keep you\nentertained. We need more comics,\nmore wit, more investigative journalism and more satire, and I mean\nMock The Week style repartee localised to Imperial.\nI love Felix, and with the experience I\u2019ve gained, I\u2019ve been able to\nensure my sections were produced\nto the highest standards in both\ncontent and coverage. I aspire to\nbring this rigorousness to the whole\npaper. Felix is an award winning\npublication, and your vote can keep\nit that way. Vote Alexander Karapetian.

Should I become editor\nI would use my place in the Union\nto report on as much Union politics\nas allowed under the constitution,\nin order to inform fellow students of\nwhat goes on and why, as well as\nkeep the Union on its toes.\nRegarding recent controversies, I\nbelieve that whilst Felix should aim\nto conform to the standards set by\nthe British press (minus the phone\nhacking) Hangman deserves greater freedom of expression. Should\nHangman still be cancelled I will\nbring it back, as I know the section has the potential to offer up\ngood, satirical humour. I won\u2019t impose hard and fast rules upon the\nsection, and will judge each piece\non its own merit. I will continue to\nencourage new writers to write for\nthe paper, emphasising its more\nrelaxed nature - Felix isn\u2019t an exclusive society!\nOver time I wish to refine the number of issues printed each week, reducing wastage. This will be through\ndiscussion with the printers and\nweekly assessment of the number\nof wasted copies. Likewise, I hope\nto reduce the number of adverts\nfound in the paper, though only if\nthis does not come at the cost of\nreduced quality.\nLaurence Pope - for a phone-hack\nfree Felix.\nDEPUTY PRESIDENT (EDUCATION)\nFELIX EDITOR\nTimothy Arbabzadah\nI\n\u2019m currently the Comment Editor and love writing for, editing,\nand reading Felix.

Vote Hangman for President. I\u2019m not sure\nhow I\u2019m going to change anything, but I sure am enthusias-tic. If elected I probably won\u2019t drop out, and if that happens\nI really really really want to make everything at the Union\nway better than it currently is. I\u2019m talking about a whole new\nwebsite with a working search function. How about having\nMetric open during the day? I even want to try to get more\nstudents involved. Not sure with what exactly, but I\u2019m sure\nthere\u2019s something for them to do. What I\u2019m really looking\nforward to is all the super long meetings with various College committees. I personally find them super fun. Actually\nfuck this, the above is all bollocks. Surely you should know\nHangman better than that? I know College and the Union\ninside out, and I\u2019m going to wreck this place up. Vote for\nme and Save Imperial!\nMy name is Hangman, and if there is one thing I will do for you\nit\u2019ll be getting you a 1st\nfor your degree. If elected I will lobby\ncollege continually to make all degrees equal. That way everyone can stop being boring and sleeping in the library all\nthe time. However I\u2019m not just a one trick pony, I\u2019d also like\nto unextend the college day, with the aim of eradicating all\npre-12pm lectures. I never made it to those anyway. In fact\naxe humanities completely and there may be room for lunch.\nI also want to make sure everyone does the NSS. I\u2019ll achieve\nthis by creating a policy stating you will not qualify for you\ndegree (which will be a 1st\n) unless it is completed. To speed\nup the process some departments have begun collecting\nstudent details and falsifying the survey (Conputing). This\nshould be College wide. Lastly I\u2019ll bring back the feedback\npolicy, for it to never be completed as usual.\nHi I\u2019m Hangman. Unfortunately I don\u2019t conform to the recent\nwinning trend of being a female candidate for DPCS, however just like every other successful candidate I do have great\nadministration skills. I can use Outlook, Word, PowerPoint\nand can operate a telephone. This makes me more than\nsuitably qualified to frustrate Clubs & Societies by being\nrude, ignoring their pleas for help and generating false information which obviously highlights the inadequacy of this\nrole. I promise to merge all Clubs & Societies against their\nwill into just one Club and one Society. Furthermore I will\nagain cut Club & Society funding so that we can increase\nthe money available for me to go on holiday and do sod all.\nThere\u2019s nothing new here, we all know that four permanent\nstaff members already do this role. So if I\u2019m going to be the\nusual waste of air, I may as well do it at your expense.\nAs Hangman, I\u2019ve been part of Felix for four years. That\nhands down gives me the most experience over any other\ncandidate. If elected, and I will be elected (or else), I promise that I\u2019ll redesign the paper. By redesign, I mean get rid\nof. No more paper, instead Felix will give every student an\niPad 3 with the issue automatically being pushed out every Friday. In fact everything will be automatic. I\u2019m talking\nautomatic layouts, automatic spelling correction, automatic\ncontent generation and even automatic dictation. On top of\nthat I\u2019m going to get rid of all adverts. No one likes adverts.\nMaybe I\u2019ll even quadruple the Hangman pages (I\u2019ll make\nmy mind up later). On top of all that, every Wednesday will\nbe free Felix party night in the Felix office. It\u2019s guaranteed\nto be better and more intimate than Metric. Drugs not provided but suggested \u2013 for the sheer scandal, obviously.\nMy extensive expertise in the realm of welfare has been\ndocumented publicly over the years. Known as a figurehead amongst senior College officials for pioneering the\nHangman Wellbeing Survey, I, Hangman, care about all\npeoples. There have been accusations in the past that I\ndiscriminate against race/gender/sexuality/age/species\n(delete as appropriate), however my strong pastoral background has taught me to discriminate equally. If elected, I\npromise to try my hardest to do absolutely nothing, much\nlike those in the role before me, and let me tell you \u2013 doing\nnothing IS doing something! I, like the current welfare sab-batical, am more than happy to play with condoms, cry to\nchick flicks and annoy the fuck out of everybody. So vote\nfor stagnation, vote for pointless expenses and vote for re-dundancy. Hangman, never there for you.\nMoney, I\u2019m all about the Money! Hangman is rolling in dol-lar. So much so, If I\u2019m elected I\u2019ll float Imperial College\nUnion on the FTSE 100. More so, I\u2019m going to change the\ncurrency to $ICU just because I can. I\u2019ll reduce costs by\neliminating all permanent staff and with the money saved\nwe can have an open bar... all year round! Not just the\nSummer Ball! Speaking of balls, I\u2019m single handedly going to balance the gender ratio by consolidating Goldsmith\nStudents\u2019 Union into one simple easy-to-manage organisa-tion. Who said debt consolidation was limited to the extrav-agant? With a background of being the treasurer of both\nthe Gender Equality Society and Tamil Society; I hands\ndowns have the experience needed to do a job a professional with several legitimate qualifications should be hired\nto do and manage.\nhangman\nhangman\nhangman\nhangman\nhangman\nhangman\nNOW100%TYPOFREE!\n\n"

The study reveals\nthat the increasing replacement of multi-year ice by saltier seasonal ice is driving\nthe increased release of salt ions such as\nbromine into the atmosphere, which then\ninteracts with various atmospheric components such as pollutants and ozone.\nThe team of researchers from the\nUK, USA, Canada and Germany combined data from NASA, European Space\nAgency and Canadian Space Agency\nsatellites with field observations and an\natmospheric model in order to observe\nbromine release and establish the atmospheric height at which the process oc-curs.\nBromine occurs as dissolved ions in\nseawater, and becomes incorporated\ninto sea ice upon freezing. Upon interaction with solar radiation at the boundary layer between the atmosphere and\nsea-ice surface, salt ions (such as bro-mine) are oxidised into reactive species and released into the troposphere.\nCascades of chemical reactions then oc-cur, termed the \u2018bromine explosion\u2019, to\nproduce bromine monoxide which goes\non to react with mercury and other toxic\npollutants. The mercury and bromine\ncomplex is subsequently deposited on\nland and in ocean waters.\nYounger seasonal sea ice, that forms\nand melts annually, has a higher salt\ncontent than older perennial ice, suggesting the disappearance of old ice\nwill cause an increase in bromine ex-plosions. Perennial sea ice has declined\nin surface area by half on average since\n2000, and replaced by saltier seasonal\nsea ice, suggesting that global warming\nmay cause more bromine explosions in\nthe future.\nSon Nghiem, a NASA scientist based\nat the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in\nCalifornia and leader of the study com-mented: \u201cShrinking summer sea ice\nhas drawn much attention of exploiting\nArctic resources and improving maritime trading routes, but the change in\nsea ice composition also has impact on\nthe environments. Changing conditions\nin the Arctic might increase bromine\nexplosions in the future.\u201d\nThe study found that mountain ranges\nbordering Alaska and Canada act as\nphysical boundaries to the occurrence\nof bromine in the lower atmosphere,\nrevealing that the chemical reactions\nassociated with the bromine explosion\nin the Arctic Ocean are contained in the\nlower 2km of Earth\u2019s troposphere. This guy is on a mission to find the lost Arctic sea ice\nDrinking in space can be a messy affair.\nIn the absence of gravity liquid floats requiring all drinks to be sucked up from\na pouch using a straw \u2013 a particularly\nodd sensation when having your hot\ncoffee in the morning. But now, thanks\nto NASA astronaut Dr. Don Pettit, sipping from an open top cup is possible,\neven in the zero gravity.\nDr. Pettit, a member of the International Space Station (ISS) crew, occupies his spare time in space by conducting fascinating experiments for school\nchildren via video and inventing useful\ngadgets. It was during the STS-126\nmission to the ISS that he finally became fed up of feeling \u201clike an insect\u201d\nsucking up all his beverages and so, in\n2008, he created the Zero-G Cup.\nTo make the cup Pettit folded over\nplastic sheet and sealed it with yellow\n\u201cspace-tape\u201d to form a teardrop shaped\nvessel with an acute angle along one\nside. This shape creates a meniscus\nthat, due to surface tension, keeps most\nof the liquid at the bottom. At the same\ntime it allows a small stream to run up\nthe side by a force called capillary ac-tion. Inspired by the fuel delivery method of rocket engines, Dr. Pettit knew\nthat due to the acute angle of the cup\u2019s\ncross-section, liquid would be drawn up\nthe side and rest next to the lip.\nThe Zero-G Cup not only allows hot\ndrinks to be sipped from an open top \u2013\ngreatly satisfying for coffee lovers such\nas Pettit. But, as a video from the ISS\nshows, also allows the crew to make\ncelebratory toasts!\nIn order to improve the crude initial\ndesign, Dr. Pettit teamed up with designer Travis Baldwin to come up with\na more robust space cup, from which\nan espresso can be sipped in stylish\ncomfort. The base is small to keep the\ncoffee in place by surface tension, deep\ngrooves allow the coffee to climb the\nsides and the small indentation at the top\nkeeps liquid in place at the lip. Due to\nits popularity with the crew NASA has\nnow adopted Pettit\u2019s cup as standard kit\nfor the ISS and any other manned space\nflights it launches in the future.\nDr. Pettit is currently on the ISS as a\nmember of the Expedition 30 crew and\nis continuing his scientific demonstra-tions. NASA and the American Physical Society (APS) have teamed up to\nshare his unique videos from the ISS\nwith students, educators and science\nfans around the world. Using everyday objects from Earth, Dr. Pettit demonstrates physics in a series of videos\ncalled \u201cScience off the Sphere\u201d, which\nincludes a demonstration of the Zero-G\nCup and can be found on the Physics\nCentral website. And this time Dr. Pettit\nhas even added a physics challenge for\nthe viewers!\nBottoms up\nin zero-G\nEmma Houghton-Brown\nIn the 21st\ncentury, our minds are brimming with concepts from iPhones to genetic testing to superstring theory, that\ncould not have been entertained by our\nhuman counterparts centuries or millennia ago. This is because our species has\na unique capability for \u201ccumulative culture\u201d, a process through which knowledge accumulates over time and technology is advanced iteratively. On the\nother hand, we can reasonably assume\nthat the ideas inside the minds of other\nanimals today are not vastly different\nfrom those centuries ago. Therefore,\na team of scientists from University\nof St Andrews are seeking to explain\nwhat is special about the human mind\nthat allows us to gradually accumulate\nknowledge. A study reported this week\nin Science investigated the differences\nin the capacity for cumulative cultural\nlearning among humans, our closest\nrelatives, chimpanzees, and capuchin\nmonkeys.\nThere are various hypotheses regarding the cognitive capabilities, or social\nconditions, that are required for cumulative culture. These include aspects of\nsocial cognition that are either exclusive to or substantially enhanced in hu-mans. For example, imitation, teaching,\nlanguage and helping others. Additionally, characteristics of other animals\nthat may prevent cumulative culture include scrounging of resources, as well\nas the tendency of dominant individuals\nto monopolise resources, thereby preventing subordinate individuals from\nlearning.\nIn order to examine the mechanisms\nbehind social learning, the scientists\nused a puzzle-box with three stages of\nincreasing difficulty to test three- or\nfour-year old children, chimpanzees\nand capuchins. Children, rather than\nadult humans, were used to help remove cultural effects since adults have\nbeen more exposed and influenced by\nsociety. The scientists hypothesised that\nchildren, but not chimpanzees or capu-chins, would show evidence of cumulative learning, and also sought to discover the underlying explanations. They\nfound that after 30 hours, only 1 out of\n33 chimpanzees had reached stage 3 of\nthe puzzle and similarly, after 53 hours,\nno capuchins had reached stage 3. By\ncontrast, after just two and a half hours,\na significant number of children had\nreached the most difficult stage.\nTo determine the underlying mecha-nisms, the authors firstly reasoned that\nif a factor, such as teaching, causes\ncumulative culture then a species that\nteaches (humans) should perform better on the task than a species that does\nnot (chimpanzees and capuchins). Secondly, they hypothesised that when\nteaching occurs in a particular species,\nit should be positively correlated with\ntask performance. Using this reasoning,\nand testing a number of hypotheses, the\nscientists found that teaching, commu-nication, imitation and helping others,\nlargely only present in humans, likely\ncontribute to the ability of humans to\naccumulate knowledge.\nThe authors state, \u201cThe puzzle-box\nexperiment reveals clear and characteristic differences in cumulative cultural\nlearning and patterns of social interaction among children, chimpanzees,\nand capuchin monkeys. The children\nresponded to the apparatus as a social\nexercise, manipulating the box together,\nmatching the actions of others, facilitating learning in others through verbal\ninstruction and gesture. In contrast, the\nchimpanzees and capuchins appeared\nto interact with the apparatus purely\nas a means to procure resources for\nthemselves, in an entirely self-serving\nmanner, largely independent of the performance of others, and exhibiting restricted learning that appeared primarily asocial in character.\u201d\nThis study provides valuable new\ninsights into the phenomenon of cumulative culture, a powerful capability\nwhich largely explains the remarkable\nsuccess of the human species in colo-nising almost every terrestrial habitat\non the planet and becoming globally\ndominant. The research also paves the\nway for understanding when precisely\nthese uniquely human socio-cognitive\ncapacities evolved.\nDOI: 10.1126/science.1213969\nCumulative culture makes us different\nSophia David\nCarys Cook\nSuperstring theory \u2013 a product of\n\u201ccumulative culture\u201d?\n\n"

When his brother suspects that his\nwife (Judy Greer) may be cheating, Jeff helps with the spying process. The Duplass brothers,\nhaving both written and directed the film, have assembled a killer cast, and all the festival\nattention this has been receiving bodes well for the film\u2019s overall quality.\nAlbert Nobbs (27 April)\nGlenn Close is now a six-time Oscar nominee thanks to her latest passion project. Adapting a\nplay she performed around thirty years ago, her performance has won rave reviews since its\nrelease last year, and it finally hits the screens here. The tragic story of a woman living disguised as a male butler in 19th century Ireland to survive and make ends meet in the sexist\nsociety, Close never sets a foot wrong in portraying the paranoid woman trapped within the\nwalls she built for her protection. It\u2019s a touching, gentle and subtle drama that also makes\ngood use of its excellent ensemble. Janet McTeer also nabbed an Oscar nomination as the\nperson providing support for Close, whereas Mia Wasikowska is her usual charming self.\nThe Cabin in the Woods (13 April)\nBefore you roll your eyes and dismiss this as yet another predictable slasher horror in which\nattractive youngsters are killed off one by one by a deranged psychopath after the group\nmakes the foolish mistake of going to an abandoned house in the middle of nowhere, have\na closer look at the trailer. To start off with, these unfortunate people are harassed by not\none serial killer, but instead a secret, well-organised group which seems to be equipped\nwith hi-tech terrorising resources. Produced by Joss Whedon, the man behind Buffy and this\nsummer\u2019s much anticipated Avengers Assemble, The Cabin in the Woods could be that rare\nhorror film that carries with it some originality as well as some genuinely scary moments.\nAmerican Reunion (2 May)\nThe original American Pie gang is back, 9 years after their American Wedding stint. Times\nhave changed, their living situations have changed, but have they really grown up? Jim (Ja-son Biggs) and Michelle (Alyson Hannigan) are busy bringing up their two year-old son, Kevin\n(Thomas Ian Nicholas) is a married househusband, Oz (Chris Klein) has a new hot squeeze,\nand Stifler (Seann William Scott) is still Stifler, but with a job this time (we see him defecating in a picnic basket so maybe thankfully for the audience, he hasn\u2019t quite matured). Also\nback are Jim\u2019s Dad (Eugene Levy) and Stifler\u2019s Mom (Jennifer Coolidge) who end up in the\nsame bedroom. Will the destined pair finally hook up in this instalment? Only time will tell.\nSalmon Fishing in the Yemen (20 April)\nThis must have been an absolute nightmare to finance and advertise for, given its highly\nunappealing title \u2013 fishing itself is an acquired-taste kind of activity, take this to the Yemen\nand you\u2019ll have an even smaller audience. But Lasse Hallstr\u00f6m, known for his heart-warming\ndramas (Chocolat, Hachi: A Dog\u2019s Tale, Dear John), is the reliable man in charge telling the\nstory of a fisheries expert (Emily Blunt), a consultant (Ewan McGregor), and a hopeful Sheik\n(Amr Waked) coming together to bring the sport of fly-fishing to the desert of Yemen. Despite\nthe seemingly bland subject material, Blunt and McGregor form a likable team, and Kristin\nScott Thomas pitches in some fine comic performance as an ambitious politician.\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX\nFriday 09 MARCH 2012\n6\nfeatures.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFeatures Editors: Katy Bettany\nStephen Smith\nFEATURES\nthe main dissenting voice shifted to\na more radical ideology. A number of\nstudent unions, who were originally\nagainst the fees, ended up removing\ntheir opposition in an attempt to work\nwith the government.\nMeanwhile those left on the streets\nbecame radicalised by the lack of concession from the state, and the severe\npolice oppression that accompanied\nthe protests. As the protests progressed the students were joined by\nschool children and anti-cuts protestors (not all mutually exclusive). The\nscenes became more violent ending\nwith the near death of Alfie Meadows\nfrom a police assault.\nThe more radical groups of the student movement organised in occupations and formed bodies such as the\nEducation Activist Network and the\nNational Campaign Against Fees and\nCuts. These students called for the\nNUS president of the time, Aaron Porter, to resign due to his lack of support\nfor, and even condemnation of, the occupations and protests after Millbank.\nSince this split there has been little\ninteraction between these two groups.\nHowever, due to the treatment of\nPorter the new NUS president, Liam\nBurns, used a more pro-activist stance\nduring his campaign. Up until now\nthis had lead to very little, with Michael Chessum (head of the National\nCampaign Against Fees and Cuts) remarking how poorly the student demo\nin the Autumn of 2011 was supported\nby NUS.\nThe march was organised by few\nO\nn the student march last\nterm, as 10,000 people\nprotesting against the\ngovernment\u2019s Higher\nEducation white paper trundled through a path laid out\nby 4,000 riot police, a chant rose up:\n\u201cLets go back to Millbank, Na-NaNa-Na, Hey!\u201d But what is the student\nmovement now?\nIs it merely nostalgia for a sudden,\nshort fight back against the fee increases in 2010; or, with the imminent\nNUS week of action, has it developed\ninto a sustained campaign to prevent\nprivatisation and increased competition in our already heavily socially\ndivided university system?\nHere, I discuss how the student\nmovement has gone from Millbank to\nthe first NUS-supported action since\n(happening next week).\nOn 10 November 2010 the NUS\norganised a 50,000 strong march that\nfilled the streets of London. In the normal treatment of marches this was being given mild media coverage and almost no political attention until 2,000\nstudents pushed past police lines into\nthe Conservatives\u2019 Millbank HQ. The\nlobby was destroyed, parties started\nand a sudden dynamic changed in the\ndebate. A movement that had received\nreasonable cross-party support within\nthe student population \u2013 I sat in planning meetings with devout Tories \u2013\nnow seemed to have split.\nOn one side remained those who\nbelieved change would happen by\nmarching serenely from A to B, writing letters to MPs and calling on the\nNUS to lobby on their behalf. The\nother half demonstrated over the following two months how they believed\nthe current political avenues were de-funct, and how direct action was the\nsolution \u2013 from occupying tens of university buildings (in one case for nine\nmonths!) to attempting to storm parliament on the day of the vote.\nThis spectrum of action has always\nexisted but the autumn of 2010 was\nunique in a generation for the sheer\nquantity that abandoned the establishment line. As the Newsnight reporter\nPaul Mason observed, overnight Liberal Democrat supporters had morphed\ninto black-bloc anarchists.\nIn both political views and actions\npeople with little money, leading to\ncomplications that caused many student unions to pull their support and\nnot pay for coaches.\nEven though \u00a39,000 fees will be imposed in autumn this year, the action\nagainst the government\u2019s plans are\npicking up again - after a year of qui-escence. The NUS are calling a week\nof action from 12\u201316 March where\nthey want students walking out of\ncampuses and lecture theatres across\nthe country.\nWith higher fees seeming almost\ninevitable the NUS have changed tack\nand are focussing on government plans\nhas to overhaul the university system.\nThe coalition\u2019s plans involve the\nrapid privatisation of universities,\nwith not just the go ahead given to\nlow-end private providers, but also the\nencouragement for current universities to privatise. This poses the issue\nof not just a reduction in the quality\nof education as fees are siphoned off\nto pay board members, but also asset\nstripping \u2013 where valuable parts of the\nuniversity, such as buildings and land,\nare sold to line the pockets of those\nsame lucky board members.\nThe plans also allow the market failure of universities, which could cause\ngreat disruption to learning and the\npossibility that hidden costs (for lab\nequipment, fieldtrips, materials) will\ncreep in on top of the fees.\nImperial, however, is unlikely to\ntake part in the week of action. Not\nonly does it have no obligation (with\nit not being a member of the NUS or\nULU) but the president, Scott Heath,\nstates that, \u201cit is the same week as the\nunion elections and we will be helping\nthe students take part in the democracy here instead\u2026also we won\u2019t be encouraging a walk out as students come\nhere for an education.\u201d\nThis is not surprising, as not only\ndid Imperial have no involvement in\nthe first wave of student protest but\nalso the changes will probably have\nlittle effect on Imperial, with them\nmore likely to harm the universities\nattended by the poorest students.\nAlthough, once again, the plans are\nmoving away from the NUS and the\nstudent unions with student activists\nand more radical student unions calling for a ULU feeder march on the\n14th of March ending in parliament\nsquare. With thousands already con-firmed, there are calls on the NUS to\nsupport it, but there appears to be silence on their part.\nThe student movement was beginning to appear aligned as the week\nof action against the privatisation of\nuniversities approached; but cracks\nalong old faults are starting to open\nagain and the ideological divides seem\nunlikely to heal. While the opposition\nto the rest of the government plans, of\nwhich the fee increase was merely a\nstart, begins to build, it seems the students will not fight back united.\nThe NUS seem set on toeing the\nline with the political class and do not\nwant a repeat of Millbank. But after\na year of anti-cuts and anti-capitalist\naction, there are large sections of the\nstudent community who have disaffected completely from party politics\nand seem unlikely to return.\nStudent protests: one year on\nLuke Sheldon asks where the student movement is now, twelve months after it began\nNo ifs, no buts...\nJosh Towers\nDavid Cameron looking suspiciously like Bashar al-Assad\nAhmed Peerbux\n\u201cI sat in planning\nmeetings with devout\nTories\u201d\nT\n\n"

    "content": "FOOD\nFELIX\nFriday 09 MARCH 2012\n34\nfood.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFood Editors: Anastasia Eleftheriou\nMichael Krestas\nMake your own nuggets\nWe all love nuggets; it\u2019s the first choice, possibly\nafter burgers, that we usually choose to eat at a\nfast-food restaurant. Despite the addictive taste\nof the fast-food nuggets, they are really bad for our\nhealth; and it\u2019s not only about fat and frying. We\ncannot be sure of the quality of the chicken used\nfor their production, basically because we cannot\neven recognize whether it is chicken at all. They\ncould have used literally any cheap material that\ntastes good.\nFor those who enjoy eating nuggets very often\nand are concerned about health problems or they\nwant to keep fit, I will explain in simple words how\nI used to make delicious nuggets at home that are\nlow in calories.\nFirstly, you need to preheat the oven to 200 degrees and put a non-stick baking sheet to a pan\nand grease it with butter. Take 2 chicken fillets and\npound evenly until they are about half their original\nthickness. Cut up the fillets in pieces and season\nwith salt and pepper.\nThen you need 3 bowls. In the first one put half\ncup of flour, in the second one 2 eggs (yes, you do\nneed to whisk them before) and in the final one a\ncup of breadcrumbs, some parmesan and orega-no. After that you just put each piece of chicken\nin the bowls in order (flour \u2013 eggs \u2013 breadcrumbs)\nand you place them in the pan. For extra taste,\nspread some olive oil on top of the nuggets.\nThey need approximately 30 minutes in the\noven, but don\u2019t forget to turn them after the first\n15 minutes in order to get a brown colour on both\nsides. To make it a healthy supper serve it with\nsalad, or for a complete meal serve it with chips\nand ketchup or mayonnaise.\nGoing vegan: third week\u2019s the charm\nby Anastasia Eleftheriou\nMilk was such an important part of our diets\nbefore veganism and we\u2019ve been finding it\nhard coping without it in our cereal and tea.\nSo we thought this week that we\u2019d investigate\nfour different alternatives to cow\u2019s milk to see\nwhich one we liked the best.\nThe four milks we chose were classic unsweetened soya milk, almond milk, rice milk\nand oat milk. We investigated each milk on its\nown and then with tea and shredded wheat.\nIt\u2019s fair to say that soya milk was the closest\nalternative to cow\u2019s milk \u2013 perhaps there is a\nreason why it\u2019s already the most popular alter-native. In tea we couldn\u2019t taste the difference\ncompared to cow\u2019s milk, but then again we\nhave been drinking soya milk for two weeks\nalready and are enjoying it. It also goes well\nwith cereal, being very close to skimmed milk.\nIn our opinion we felt that the other milks\nIt\u2019s all about Me Me\nI\npassed Me Me almost every day in\nmy second and third years of College,\nbut only ate there once. I returned\nagain last night to satisfy the craving I\u2019ve been having for Vietnamese\nfood. From the outside it looks pretty stan-dard. Menu in the window, bright sign and\na bright welcoming look to it. Go inside\nand the guy will be sitting there playing\nWarcraft on his laptop, oh the authenticity.\nHe does greet us, before he lets his female\ncounterpart show us to our table. The front\nof the restaurant looks quite cramped, but\ntowards the back it widens out, and there are\nsome bigger tables. The menu is very inter-esting, and has a wide selection of Vietnamese food, and the westernised classics. They\nhave written all the names of the authentic\ndishes in green, which immediately attracts\nme to them. They all have a good English\ndescription, so you know what you\u2019re in for.\nAs for drinks, don\u2019t expect any high quality\nwines or beer, but the jasmine tea went down\na treat.\nWe got summer rolls for starters. I know\nwhat you\u2019re thinking, are they just the same\ngreasy deep fried things you get in a Chinese restaurant, just with a different season.\nOh how wrong you are. A summer roll lives\nup to its name. They have prawns, the freshest herbs (mint and coriander mainly), add\nsome rice vermicelli noodles all wrapped\nup in rice paper. Then dip it in a slightly\nspicy peanut sauce, and take a bite of sum-mer; which with summer fast approaching, I\nam filled with excitement for London in the\nsummer time.\nThe mains came in little metal pots with\nlids, which I thought was a nice touch. I like\ntaking a lid off food, it\u2019s like unwrapping a\npresent. We ordered Pork Kho, which had\na pungent smell (in a good way.) The meat\nwas very tender, and fell apart easily. This,\nfor someone who isn\u2019t an expert with chop-sticks, was appreciated. The taste was im-pressive. It wasn\u2019t due to a great combination\nof flavors; it was the one powerful flavor\nthat made this dish. I later learned that the\nsauce is made from fermented soybeans.\nThe smell somewhat reminds me of a brew-ery, not the most pleasing to the nose, but I\nstill want to drink it. It also came with a little plate of vegetables, mostly bean sprouts,\nagain mixed with some very fresh herbs, and\na taste of lime. I wasn\u2019t sure they belonged\ntogether, but eaten separately they were a\ngood contrast; maybe that\u2019s the intention.\nOverall I found Me Me to be very satisfying \u2013 they had very authentic food without\ntrying to be one of those fashionable \u2018real\nthing\u2019 restaurants that can charge ten times\nthe price because some food critic says so.\nStick to the green highlighted food on the\nmenu and you are sure for a good experience.\nMe Me\nwww.memerestaurant.co.uk\n565 Fulham Road, SW6 1ES\nThis is all for the MS Trust! Please sponsor Hannah and Clare at uk.virginmoneygiving.com/team/goingvegan\nshouldn\u2019t be considered as alternatives to\ncow\u2019s milk, for example in the way that coconut milk isn\u2019t considered an alternative. In\nits own right, rice milk was really nice. It was\nkind of creamy and mixed well with tea and\ncereal.\nIf you have a sweet tooth then perhaps almond milk would be for you. Despite its wa-tery-ness, it is sweet and nutty. It\u2019s very nice\nwith tea even though it doesn\u2019t mix very well.\nWith cereal however it\u2019s not so good.\nI\u2019m sure for some out there oat milk is nice,\nbut I have to admit we really didn\u2019t like it. It\u2019s\nfair to say on its own it was quite interesting and oaty. However with cereal and milk\nit was disgusting because it had too much of\nits own flavour, making it a sour accompani-ment. It was as wrong as mixing orange juice\nwith tea or cereal.\nSo for now we\u2019re going to stick with our\ngood old soya milk. If anything, Jordans\nCountry Crisp with Chunky Nuts tastes better with sweetened Alpro Soy soya milk. So\nin conclusion if you\u2019re looking for an alternative to milk, whether you\u2019re vegan or just\nhealth conscious, soya milk is the one for\nyou.\nClare Cheng\nHannah Cox\nwww.examiner.com\nHere\u2019s your \u2018worrying-looking cow\u2019 fix of\nthe week, enjoy!\nStephen Gallagher pays a visit to the Vietnamese restaurant\nSo what you need to do now is try the recipe and\ngive me feedback!

Ranging from ex-pressionism, cross hatching and papiers\ncolle (collages), neo-classicism, cubism\nwith its typical elements (the guitar, jugs\nand lemons) to purely abstract art with\nbonelike forms, it is impossible to classify Picasso as anything other than an ever\ndeveloping, experimental modernist.\nWithout a doubt, what I most appreciated from the exhibition was the op-ARTS\nFELIX Friday 09 march 2012 19\n\u00bfNo Pablo Ingl\u00e9s?\nTate Britain examines the relationship between modern British art and Picasso\nI remember being mesmerised when\nseeing Picasso\u2019s \u2018Guernica\u2019 for the first\ntime in Madrid; the same happened to\nthe millions of Brits who were able to\nsee the imposing painting when it was-first exhibited in England.

It\ncontained a variety of Picasso\u2019s stunning\npaintings and prints, those that were first\nexhibited in London between 1910 and\n1914, and at the time widely rejected\nand negatively criticised. Particularly\nbreathtaking is his etching \u2018The Frugal\nMeal\u2019, which was the first of his works\nto enter a public British collection.

Our base for the duration of\nthe tournament was the bustling Vauxhall Holiday Park where all the university teams resided (the ones that didn\u2019t\nend up on the streets that is!). After\nregistering and catching a glimpse of\nthe 36 pristine Supreme Pool tables\nthe anticipation kicked in and we were\nready to get the ball rolling.\nThe qualifying matches for the individual championships were played on\nDay 1 and were first to three frames.\nStanley Cheng our resident 9 ball\nplayer started well against Mike Kay\nof Aston and secured the match with\n\u201cStan it in specials\u201d and an audacious\ndouble on the winning black. The only\nthing Stanley didn\u2019t do in a hurry was\nreturn the white ball to the director after the victory! \u201cTake it to the Max\u201d\nChalmers was next up and edged into\na 2-1 lead and eventually sealed the\nmatch by continuing Imperial\u2019s growing tradition of doubling the black in.\nUnfortunately Andy Leung couldn\u2019t\npull through his match losing 3-0 to\nStephen Brooks from Warwick 1st\u2019s.\nFinally at 6.00pm Shyam Pankhania\nwas able to get his tournament off to\na flying start by clinically disposing\nof his opponent Paddy Brown from\nSheffield 3-0, to which Max Chalmers\ncommented \u201cHe\u2019s having a stormer!\u201d\nThe 2nd round of qualifying began\nwith an emphatic 3-0 win for Stanley, but Captain Carlos who received\na bye into qualifying round 2 failed to\nget out of first gear and his opponent\nwon 3-1. Max Chalmers match went\nto a decider in which he potted six reds\nafter the break and had the chance to\nserve a Dish on his opponent (potting\noff the break and clearing up). However an error from \u201cMagic Max\u201d cost\nhim and his opponent Garry Rayment\nJr went on to pinch the match. In the\nfinal match of the day Shyam Pankhania went 2-0 behind to Geraint Evans\nof Durham 2nd\u2019s, but the determined\n\u201cShamful\u201d was just about to dish up a\nhandful. With the teams support and\nsome gritty tactical pool Shyam levelled the match at 2-2. Shyam grabbed\nhis chance in the final frame to complete an outstanding comeback to book\nhis place in the last 128.\nThe individual tournament resumed\non Day 3 with the matches extended\nto first to four with Stanley Cheng\nand Shyam Pankhania looking to gain\na place in the last 64. Stanley shared\nthe opening two frames with James\nPaul of Manchester 2nd\u2019s, however\nStanley went on to suffer a 4-2 de-feat. All hopes now rested with Shyam\n\u201cShamful\u201d Pankhania. Unfortunately\nIfan Williams of Cardiff controlled the\nopening exchanges and after Shyam\npotted several outstanding yellows, he\nwent on to knock in his opponents yellow after potting a difficult long black;\ntherefore going 1-0 behind. Ifan Williams was too good on the day and ran\nout with a 4-0 victory to end Imperial\u2019s\nrun in the individuals.\nIn the team tournament Imperial\nwere in the Shield alongside three\nother first teams and one second team.\nThe format was that each player in a\nteam would play single frame matches\nagainst two players in the opposing\nteam, with the winning team being the\nfirst team to secure 6 frames. After a\n5-5 draw against UEA 1st\u2019s, Imperial\ntook on a Sheffield team with Midlands Snooker Cup finalist Abhishek\nRaj. El-Win Carlos ended his losing\nstart by edging a scrappy win over Rishi Aggarwal however this was only\nafter missing a cuttable black to lose\nagainst Abhishek Raj. Imperial ended\nDay 2 with one draw and one loss and\nto reach the last 8 we needed to win\nour remaining matches. To raise the\nspirits that evening the team embarked\non an arduous forty minute walk to\nPlanet Poppadum and sampled the delightful Indian cuisine that Great Yarmouth had to offer.\nOn Day 3, Imperial drew 5-5 against\nthe group leaders Aston with El-Win\nCarlos finally waking up and comfortably winning both his frames and Stanley continuing his tremendous form.\nImperial 1st\u2019s then comfortably beat a\ndrunken Nottingham Trent 1st\u2019s, however this was after Elwin lost against\nhis drunk opponent Jason Dalton who\nattempted to chat up the referee between frames and insisted on taking a\nsip of his pint between every shot. ElWin had suffered embarrassing defeats\nin the past, but this was a low! Jokingly he suggested \u201cWhat next?\u201d Imperial won the tie 6-3 with Andy Leung\nplaying \u201cLeung pots\u201d to win both his\nrubbers. Regrettably results didn\u2019t go\nour way and although we beat Medway\n2nd\u2019s 6-3 Imperial finished the group\nin 4th with two wins, two draws and\none loss.\nWe thank the tournament organis-ers, the players and all those involved\nwith BUCS Pool 2012 for making it\nan incredible tournament.

    "content": "New international rail station\nEver since its conception, the future expansion of Heathrow airport has been the topic of\ndiscussion of many a government. Generations\nof our \u2018representatives\u2019 have used the topic to\ntheir political gain, including the current co-alition, who opposed the famous 3rd runway\nto help them garner support in the leafy west\nLondon suburb of Richmond Park. Now worry\nnot, this is not an article about government\npolicy; you\u2019ve had enough of those from me\nfor a while. Instead, I\u2019d like to take a moment\nto outline what is possibly the most exciting,\nand vital project for kick-starting the UK\u2019s\nfailing economy: the Thames Hub.\nProposals for an airport in the Thames estuary have existed since the 1940s, but none\nhave caught the public attention as much as\nthe current offering from Foster & Partners.\nThis is the same firm that brought you Hong\nKong and Beijing Airports, Wembley Stadium\nand London City Hall, amongst many other\nprojects. Widely publicized by Boris Johnson,\nLord Foster\u2019s latest airport in the Thames estuary would be a complete overhaul of transport in the South East, updating vital rail and\nroad links, and other important infrastructure\nincluding a much needed update of the aging\nThames barrier, and new hydroelectric power\nfacility. The main argument behind the case for\na Thames Estuary airport lies in the need to\nmaintain London\u2019s status as a hub airport. This\nis an airport where there are a large number of\npassengers passing through each year on flight\ntransfers. This enables the airport to serve a\nwider network of destinations and to sustain a\nhigh frequency of services due to the demand\nfor flights. These transferring passengers allow\nmore direct flights to more destinations to be\neconomically viable from London, thus giving\naccess to cheaper and more frequent services\nfor UK-based businesses and residents.\nCurrently, Heathrow handles just under 70\nmillion passengers per year, more than any\nother European airport, squeezed into its permitted 480,000 landing and takeoff slots. Back\nin the 1990s, Heathrow offered more destinations than any other European airport, yet recently has been faced with increased competition from hubs in Europe, including Frankfurt\nand Amsterdam. These two have 53% and\n45% of capacity as transferring passengers,\ncompared to Heathrow\u2019s 35%. This, along\nwith the availability of more runways, has allowed them to offer increasingly more destinations and services. Meanwhile, Heathrow has\nslipped to fifth in term of destinations offered,\nand will continue to slide if nothing is done.\nWhat this means is that the already struggling British economy is set to lose out on a\ngreat deal of new trade and investment, especially from emerging markets such as Brazil\nand China. Studies show that we stand to lose\nbetween \u00a38.6 and \u00a312.8bn of investment as a\nresult of the limitations posed by Heathrow\u2019s\nlack of capacity. New connecting routes are\nurgently needed to tap into the vast potential of\nthese new markets and Heathrow, even with a\nnew 3rd runway, is not placed to do this.\nProjects of this nature are never cheap, and\nBoris Island is no exception. Coming in at\n\u00a350bn in total, the airport itself holds a price\ntag of \u00a320bn and the associated infrastructure\na lofty \u00a330bn. However, to put this in perspec-tive, a new terminal and runway at Heathrow\nwould cost at least \u00a39bn. Furthermore, the\nplans for the Thames Hub include sourcing\nmuch of the funding from private investors,\nthus relieving the burden on the Treasury cof-fers. Put simply, although an expensive option,\nit is by no means fiscally unachievable, even in\nthe current economic climate.\nPromo shots for the latest Grand Theft Auto game were met with a lukewarm critical response\nFELIX\nFriday 09 MARCH 2012\n12\nbusiness.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nBusiness & Finance Editors: Will Prince\nDeepka Rana\nBUSINESS & FINANCE\nWhose line is it anyway?\nEveryone knows success in business is all about\nthe chat (cough, cough). Below are five faces from\nthe business world along with quotes from them.\nBut, using a complex algorithm we\u2019ve jumbled\nthem up. Can you work out the source of each of\nthese pearls of business wisdom?\nMore Airports for the UK?\nThe main opposition to this plan, as with any\nairport expansion, is found amongst the ranks\nof the environmentalists. The chosen location\nis apparently the home of some birds, which\nrun the risk of falling out with their man-made\nflying cousins should the plans go ahead. However, are we seriously advocating that the welfare of a few birds should stand in the way of\nthe continued recovery of the British ecoomy?\nAlso, I understand that Heathrow\u2019s current\nneighbors find it rather grim living in its flight\npath. It seems simply ludicrous that we as a\nsociety should put the lives of a few birds in\nahead of the living standards of our citizens.\nUnfortunately, we live in an increasingly bureaucratic state, where projects of this nature\nmove from committee to committee without\nvarious governmental bodies at a glacial pace.\nTake the recently opened Heathrow Terminal\n5: it took 20 years to progress from its design conception to its eventual opening, and it\nwasn\u2019t even a particularly ambitious plan. In\ncontrast, Beijing airport\u2019s Terminal 3 took just\nover four years to be ready.\nThe rapid expansion currently taking place\nin China is fueling continued growth and\nBeijing Airport, as the second busiest in the\nworld, has already been deemed by the central\ngovernment as at capacity. Work has already\nstarted on what will be the world\u2019s biggest\nairport, with a capacity of 130 million, and a\nbreathtaking 9 runways. And furthermore, they\nplan to accomplish this all in time for a 2017\nopening.\nNow it would unrealistic to expect as rapid\nprogress as occurs in China. Their efficiency\nis one positive that comes out of building in a\none-party state. However, it is about time the\nBritish government took some decisive action.\nTo quote Boris Johnson \u201cthere is no doubt that\nto do nothing would lead to economic stagnation\u201d thus leaving London unable to compete\non an international level. London needs to\nmaintain its airport hub status, and this is becoming increasingly difficult by the day as the\nrest of the world surges ahead.\nGeorge Howard\n\u201cHeathrow handles just\nunder 70 million passengers per year\u201d\nLon\nnot, th\npolicy;\nfor a w\nto outl\nand v\nfailing\nPro\ntua\nIs the sky the limit, or will it never take off? Plane crazy or runway success?\n1. Well, you know,\nI was a human being\nbefore I became a busi-nessman.\n3. Beware of geeks\nbearing formulas.\n5. You\u2019re fired!\n2. Reputation is more\nimportant than the last\nhundred million dollars.\n4.

    "content": "BOOKS\nFELIX\nFriday 09 march 2012\n30\nbooks.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nBooks Editor: Maciej Matuszewski\nLet me guess, this novel is set in Imperial Russia?\nI \ufb01nd it rather disappointing how so few of\nthe books available to readers in this country\nare written by foreign language authors. Sure,\nyou can \ufb01nd translations of all the French and\nRussian classics in the larger bookshops but\nnot much from other countries and certainly\nnothing contemporary. I\u2019m somewhat at a loss\nto explain this phenomenon. Other European\ncountries don\u2019t seem to have this problem,\nwith some bookshops devoting up to half their\n\ufb01ction section to translations. I think that it\u2019s a\ngreat loss for the British public \u2013 foreign literature is a way of immersing yourself in new cultures without leaving your home \u2013 it broadens\nthe mind and gives you a new viewpoint. I bet\nthat not many of you have even heard of Henryk Sienkiewicz, despite the man having won a\nNobel Prize in Literature. It seems that, in gen-eral, publishers have seemingly decided not to\nrun the risk of giving their readers something\ndifferent. I was therefore pleasantly surprised\nwhen I heard that the independent British publisher Atlantic Books will be putting out an\nEnglish translation of Jacek Dukaj\u2019s acclaimed\nscience \ufb01ction alternate history novel Ice before the year is out.\nIce is set in alternate universe during the\n1920s, where the 1908 Tunguska event unleashed creatures known as \u201clute\u201d. Looking\nalmost like angels made of ice they move at a\nglacial pace but bring endless winter wherever\nthey venture. As they move through Siberia,\nand later European Russia, agriculture collapses and people \ufb02ock to cities to \ufb01nd new livelihoods and protection from the deadly cold.\nThe lute have, however, created a whole new\nindustry, transmuting anything that they pass\nthrough into strange new materials, such as an\nincredibly light and strong steel or coal that,\nwhen burned, produces darkness and not light.\nThis has all drastically altered the balance of\npower on the continent \u2013 the First World War\nhas never happened and the European powers\nmaintain an uneasy peace.\nBenedykt Gieros\u0142awski, who provides the\nnovel\u2019s narration, is a poor mathematician living a Warsaw that is still occupied by the Russian Empire. He earns a pittance working as\na private tutor but everything changes when,\none morning, he is awakened by functionaries\nfrom the Ministry of Winter who inform him\nthat they want him to travel to Irkutsk, deep\nin Siberia, to \ufb01nd his father, who they believe\nhas developed an ability to speak with the lute.\nThis thrusts him into a world of political in-trigue, as various factions try to control him\nand his father for their own ends. This element is the greatest strength of Ice. The book\nis long and slow paced, allowing this complex\npolitical situation to be explored in great de-tail. We see a picture of how power in the Russian Empire is dangerously fragmented \u2013 the\nlist of the people and organisations trying to\ncontrol Benedykt is quite impressive. We have\nSzulc-of-the-Winter, the governor of Irkutsk;\nPobiedonoscew, head of the Siberian mining\nmonopoly Sibiro\u017ceto; Rappacki, the Russian\nMinister of Winter; the Tsar himself; Siberian\nJacek Dukaj\u2019s Ice\nA political and philosophical alternate history thriller\nMaciej Matuszewski\nA Handmaid\u2019s Tale\nMargaret Atwood\u2019s The Handmaid\u2019s Tale often appears on people\u2019s lists of recommended novels. Unfortunately, I have a somewhat bad record at reading\nmust-read books so I only picked it up last week.\nPerhaps, however, I should begin to pay more attention to such highly recommended books since The\nHandmaid\u2019s Tale is honestly one of the best books I\nhave ever read.\nSet in the near future where a crisis brought on by\nmass infertility has allowed a Christian fundamentalist government to take over the USA, renaming it the\nRepublic of Gilead, the novel follows Offred whose\nonly worth to the regime, as a low class but fertile\nwoman, is, in her own words, \u201ca womb on legs\u201d.\nThis is a chilling and bleakly believable tale of life\nunder an oppressive totalitarian and fundamentalist\nregime. One of the most famous quotes from the\nnovel is \u201cnolite te bastardes carborundorum\u201d but the\nfact is that we see everybody, even those who have\npositions of power or who the reader had thought\nwere strong, being ground and broken down by the\nharsh societal and political climate.\nThe focus is of course on Offred \u2013 stripped of her\nfamily, her identity and even her old name \u2013 now referred to only by the name of the man to whom she\nis providing her services. While forced to maintain a\nquiet and pious outer demeanour through her first\nperson narration we see her desperate struggle to\nmaintain her identity, and hope for a better future,\ndespite all that surrounds her.\nThe true strength of the book is its language and\nnarrative style. Offred\u2019s account is structured as if\nshe were directly addressing the reader. There is a\ngreat deal of nonlinearity as she goes off on a tangent or remembers something important from the\npast. This makes us feel like we\u2019re in her head \u2013\nmaking everything feel more real and immediate.\nShe begins to feel like a real person so we can\u2019t help\nbut feel for her.\nThis is a powerful novel that works on every level.\nAtwood is a masterful author and I thoroughly recommend that you check this and her other work out.\nMaciej Matuszewski\nseparatists; Polish terrorists and freedom \ufb01ghters; and the mysterious members of the Church\nof St. Marcyn, lead by Rasputin himself, who\nworship the Ice. I have never before read a\nbook that explores political intrigue with such\ndepth.\nUnfortunately this element is not the main\nfocus of Ice. Rather, most of the book is spent\nexploring the nature of logic, and how the fabric of reality itself has been affected by the\narrival of the lute. This could have been fascinating and we do see glimpses of brilliance\nbut Dukaj wallows in the worst excesses of\npseudo-philosophy, resulting in pages of pages\nof what, to me, is just meaningless drivel. This\nalso leads to some rather weird moments. The\n\ufb01rst line of the protagonist\u2019s narration is: \u201cIt\nwas on the eve of my Siberian Odyssey that I\n\ufb01rst began to believe that I don\u2019t exist\u201d. This\ndoubt leads him, a few chapters in, to suddenly\nswitch from \ufb01rst to third person. I do often enjoy elements of weirdness but here they don\u2019t\nhave any depth. They\u2019re fun to read but they\njust don\u2019t add anything.\nI should probably say here that I\u2019m not trying to discourage you from reading Ice. I\nrecognise that books like these can often be\nsubjective and it certainly has been popular in\nPoland, winning numerous awards. You should\ncertainly give it a go, even if only to try something different.\n\u201c...most of the book is\nspent exploring the nature of logic...\u201d\n\n"

    "content": "FASHION\nFELIX Friday 09 march 2012 29\nfashion.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFashion Editors: Saskia Verhagen\nAlice Yang\nFashion\u2019s big re-shuffle\nJacobs, Pilati, Sander, Simons and Slimane; Alice Yang brings you the latest amid a designer overhaul\nA\ns a month of high-fashion draws to an\nend with yards of lace, cashmere and\nleather erupting lavishly off the Paris\ncatwalks, the unavoidable fact is that\na tornado of names is what belies the\ncentre of its storm.\nThere has been an explosion in terms of change at\nthe top of fashion this season, morphing the familiar\nhorizon of creative designers as we know it into a\ncompletely new landscape. Fuelled by the rumour\nmill created by keen-eyed journalists anxious to\npair-off displaced designers with prospective houses,\nsuch turbulence has been envisaged ever since the\nscandal involving John Galliano kicked-off nearly a\nyear ago.\nThe biggest news to date: Hedi Slimane has replaced Stefano Pilati as the creative director at Yves\nSaint Laurent.\nLate last week, after numerous mumblings, the\nFrench luxury house confirmed that Stefano Pilati\nwould not be renewing his contract after this season.\nAlthough the house claimed in a statement that Pilati\nhad been \u201cinstrumental in rebuilding and repositioning\u201d the label, guiding it to become \u201ca contemporary\nreference in high fashion\u201d, Pilati\u2019s tenure at YSL has\nnot been without its bumps. In fact, it was widely\nspeculated a couple of seasons back that Pilati would\nbe replaced at the house since it emerged he had lost\nfavour with the label\u2019s chief executives, owing to the\nline\u2019s accessories selling better than its clothes.\nYet having followed on from Tom Ford, Pilati\u2019s\n8 years at the house have been an overall success.\nGreatly concentrated on precision tailoring and\nluxurious fabrics, Pilati\u2019s designs were sensual and\nseductive, with a heavy hint to the Parisian elegance\nSaint-Laurent himself had strived for, but which\nwere somewhat lost amongst Ford\u2019s sexually provocative pieces.\nIn fact, Pilati\u2019s last collection on Monday seemed\nalmost prophetical. Elegant bare-backs, glittering\nchain mail dresses and leather wasp-waisted jack-ets; Pilati\u2019s finale infused darkened sincerity with a\nsparkle of floral romance, as if hinting that he would\nemerge from the thicket of changeovers as a bloom\nof freshness.\nBut alas, before Pilati has managed to reveal his\nown future plans, the heads of YSL validated strong\nrumours by naming Hedi Slimane as the house\u2019s new\ncreative director.\nFor those out-of-the-know, Hedi Slimane is nothing less than a fashion legend in his own right. Having held a cult following whilst he was creative\ndirector at Dior Homme in the 2000s, and known\nfor his introduction of the super-skinny silhouette\n(i.e. the driving force behind the male skinny jeans\nrevolution); Slimane was, and still is, the menswear\ndesigner of our time. In fact, Chanel\u2019s own fashion\nmogul Karl Lagerfeld puts Slimane\u2019s suits down as\nthe reason he lost a remarkable amount of weight in\n2001.\nThis new appointment of Slimane to YSL is nothing short of a homecoming given that he led their\nmenswear designs in the late 90s, yet it is still a big\njump for the house. Not only will this be the start\nof Slimane\u2019s career in womenswear, it is photography he has dedicated himself to these past 5 years,\nand so understandably, the fashion world watches on\nwith high expectations and even higher tensions. No\ndoubtYSL\u2019s show next season will be one of the most\nhighly anticipated.\nFrom one reinstatement to another, the headline\nnews from Milan fashion week was that Jil Sander\nwould be making a return to her eponymous label 40\nyears after she founded it, following the release that\nRaf Simons would be leaving his post at the helm of\nthe house this season.\nHaving recently completed his highly acclaimed\n\u2018couture trilogy\u2019 for the label, Raf Simons\u2019 farewell\nshow was a breathtakingly simple one. With a flow\nof petal pink and ivory coats daintily clutched at the\nchest, which morphed into a procession of shiny black\nPVCandleatherdresses,Simons\u2019finalparadebrought\ntears into the eyes of those that watched. Heralded as\nhis best collection\nyet, Simons departed to a standing\novation and an\nencore; it was\na monumental\nend to his majestic journey\nof influential\nsimplicity with\nthe house.\nGiven the\ninflux of\nnewly displaced de-signers, as well\nas the prospect of\nfurther reshuffling,\na waterfall of potential candidates has\ncascaded the fashion blogosphere to\ntry and answer its\ngolden question:\nWho will be the\nnew creative director\nat Christian Dior?\nHaving ruled out Riccardo Tisci and Azzedine\nAla\u00efa last season, London designer Christopher Kane\nbecame the center of speculation last week following his collaboration with Donatella Versace on a\nCamden-inspired acidic-tie-dye collection for the diffusion line Versus.\nYet as soon as Kane had ruled himself out of the\nrace, the rumour mill turned to Haider Ackermann,\nanother of fashion\u2019s most talented new designers, after it was reported that a bouquet of flowers had been\nsent to Dior\u2019s HQ earlier this week with a congratulatory message for him. This has since sent editors and\nbloggers alike into a flurry, as not only was Ackermann popularly conceived to be \u201ctoo edgy\u201d for the\nlegendary label, it is well known that Karl Lagerfeld\nhas named Ackermann as his preferred replacement\nat rival French house Chanel.\nInevitably, following the Louis Vuitton show on\nWednesday, Marc Jacobs also re-entered the scene\ndespite stating, \u201cI am at Vuitton, and I am very happy\nthere\u201d himself last year. Add onto this rumours that\nRaf Simons or Stefano Pilati may make Dior (or\neven Louis Vuitton) their new home, as well as the\nsweet sound that Galliano himself may return to the\nthrone, and the torrents currently underlying the fashion world are fast becoming as intricate as a political\npower swap.\nIts all change at the top of fashion as designers and\nhouses alike line up for a big game of musical chairs,\nyet we must remember that it is the CEOs who are\nplaying God. This leaves the creative visionaries in\nsecond place behind the money jiggling of chief ex-ecutives, and unfortunately, such expressively fragile\nimaginations have a tendency to get caught up and\nswallowed in whirls of media attention and unwarranted pressure. So as fun as this game of Guess Who\nis, let\u2019s hope for the benefit of all that this storm is\ncoming to an end.\nHedi Slimane Stefano Pilati Jil Sander Raf Simons Marc Jacobs Christopher Kane Haider Ackermann John Galliano\nYves\nSaint\nLaurent\nAW\n2012\nVersus\nAW\n2012\nJil\nSander\nAW\n2012\nJil\nSander\nAW\n2012\nHaider\nAckermann\nAW\n2012\n\u201cHedi Slimane has replaced Stefano Pilati as\nthe creative director at\nYves Saint Laurent.\u201d\n\n"

On regaining consciousness,\nhis accounts of DI Gene Hunt (Philip Glenister),\nDS Ray Carling (Dean Andrews) and DC Chris\nSkelton (Marshall Lancaster) were dismissed as\nfantasy, but for Alex, it\u2019s all about to get very\nreal.\nLured into a disused\nshipping container by\na seemingly mentally\nafflicted man with\na revolver, Alex\nis shot in the\nhead and wakes\nup to find herself in a brothel\n(and dressed as a\ntop-class prosti-tute, phwoaar)... in\n1981.

Abandoned by his own father to a foster home, 11 year-old Cyril falls into\ntrouble as he tries to reconnect with his distant father and also retrieve his lost bicycle. He\nbefriends a local hairdresser who agrees to care for him during the weekends, as well as a\nlocal gang member who manipulates the boy\u2019s need for a stable father figure to take him\nunder his wings. It has already been hailed as one of this year\u2019s most gripping, intriguing and\nexciting, despite what may sound like a slow, bog-standard, foreign indie drama.\nWe Bought a Zoo (16 March)\nAimed at a large Christmas audience in the States, the significant delay in the U.K. release\nsuggests the studio is banking on the warm, spring reception here in Europe. Which is just\nas well, because Cameron Crowe\u2019s feel-good family drama involving lots of furry animals (the\ntitle makes this clear) is an ideal film for both the older and younger generations. In a very\nJerry Maguire-type of plot, Matt Damon, who plays a likable widower, quits his job in the\ncity and decides to relocate to the quieter, brighter countryside with his two young children,\nand ends up buying a zoo for his house. Let the redemptive reconnection between a parent\nand kids begin, as well as blossoming new romance with a local hottie (Scarlett Johansson).\nTitanic 3D (5 April)\nSay what you will about the three-hour long film where essentially a boy and a girl who aren\u2019t\nsupposed to fall in love do so anyway, whilst a gigantic ship sinks after hitting an iceberg that\njeopardises the lovers\u2019 plan: the fact remains that James Cameron\u2019s Titanic walked away with\n11 Oscars and a cool 1.8 unadjusted billion dollars at the worldwide box office. One of the\nworld\u2019s most beloved films is back, this time with a 3D conversion; considering that Cameron\nis the man who started this recent obsession with the extra dimension, he must have done a\nremarkable job. An unmissable cinematic event for fans, and perhaps even first-timers may\nfind themselves hooked and tearing up at Leo and Kate\u2019s doomed romance.\nThis Must be the Place (6 April)\nA word of advice \u2013 brace yourselves before you get even a glimpse of the poster of this film.\nSean Penn has never looked this scary. And this is the man who\u2019s played convicted criminals\nin the past. No, this time he\u2019s a bored, retired rock star, a soft-spoken, slightly spaced out\nindividual. After his estranged father\u2019s unexpected death, he goes on a very personal trip\naround America to find an ex-Nazi officer who tormented his Jewish father in Auschwitz. This\nkind of eccentric character is absolutely ideal for the kind of diverse and unique actor that\nPenn is, and a self-discovery road-trip is always a good starting point for a touching and\nbeautiful journey of what appears to be an interesting character.\nThe Hunger Games (23 March)\nBased on the popular young adult novel, industry experts are hopeful that the ticket sales\nfor this will match the hype that went with the Twilight franchise. While it\u2019s still too early to\nbe making bold estimates like that, the Battle Royale-esque plot involving a futuristic world\nin which 24 unfortunately selected teenagers are first trained and then forced to fight for\ntheir lives until there is only one survivor, a \u201cgame\u201d that is watched by everyone. Intense and\ngripping, although the 12A certificate suggests there will be less blood. This also has the\nadvantage of having secured two rapidly rising stars of Hollywood as the main leads: the\nOscar-nominated, gutsy Jennifer Lawrence and The Kids are All Right\u2019s Josh Hutcherson.\n\n"

I believe strongly that my past\nexperiences have shaped\nthese two cardinal values in me and\nempowered me to want to commit to\nthe few yet highly crucial roles that a\nstudent trustee undertakes.\nPrevious Experiences:\n1) Armoured-Infantry Platoon Commander in the Singapore Armed\nForces. Responsible for the lives of\n30 men under my charge and charting\ndirections and plans for the unit as a\nwhole.\n2) Took on a professional multifaceted\nrole in TUV SUD, a german certification company (i.e. admin, laboratory,\non-site).\nMotivations:\n1) ICL has a highly international com-munity. Yet, year after year, there is\na lack of international representation\nwithin the union. I desire to be the\nunique international voice as part of\nthe independent body within the union,\nspurring constructive changes that\nwould affect the larger community.\n2) Having relished the university experience that the ICL and its community\nhas granted me thus far, I want to further enhance it for others in a position\nthat draws the most out of my abilities and attributes. In particular, the\njob of a student trustee fits my driven,\nshrewd yet stolid nature and my keen\ninterest to provide checks and balances pertaining to finances. It also\ntaps on the key strengths I possess\nas follows:\na) A calm confidence to be able to size\nthings up within a short time, make\nsound judgements and decisions that\nwould impact at the large scale, yet\npossessing a ...[word limit reached]\nTaehyun Lee\nW\nhy should anybody\nvote for me as a Student Trustee? Well,\nthat is a good question and I will answer\nthat at the end.\nBut first I thank every one of you\nreading this manifesto this instant\nbecause it means so much to me\nthat you are. Not only that you all\nare thinking about who to vote for,\nyou all care where your votes go to.\nSo I stayed up all night, for days,\nthinking about what to write here so\nthat you all get an accurate description of who I am.\nI am a fresher (like 1500 others\nhere), studying computing (like 150\nothers here). I am also an Asian\n(like 100000 here) specifically Korean (like 100 others here), but\nwhat distinguishes me is that I want\nthis Student Trustee more than anyone and I know I can do this.\nDo you have what it takes? Some\npeople ask me. Do I have what it\ntakes? I ask myself sometimes. I\nknow that I am not perfect. I know\nthis and you have all the right to\ncriticize me for who I am not. But at\nthe same time, acknowledge me for\nwho I am.\nIf you vote for me, I promise you\nthat I will do all I can to make the\nImperial College Union better, more\nenjoyable place for all of you. With\nwhat I have, for better or worse, I\nwill try my best.\nNathaniel Bottrell\nH\nello! I started Imperial\nin 2004 and next year\nwill be my final year as\na PhD student. This year\nI am a student trustee.\nIf elected for a second term, I know\nI can serve the union\u2019s major stake-holder, YOU, with the confidence the\nrole deserves.\nI believe a student trustee should\nhave a good understanding of the\nunion, and I do. I have held a number of positions in a variety of roles,\nwhich include Treasurer and President of two clubs, and chair of the\nRecreational Clubs Committee (a\nManagement Group of the union).\nAs RCC Chair, I sat on both Council and Exec, which has given me\na great understanding of the union\n(including knowing the constitution).\nA vote for me, is a vote for experi-ence.\nThe union is undergoing a major\nchange, one of which students may\nnot know about. The union is applying for charity registration and by\nlaw is required to register with the\nCharity Commission. Having already\nserved a term as a student trustee,\nI have the background knowledge to\nput forward an opinion from the student\u2019s perspective. Vote for me to\nkeep continuity through the charity\nregistration process.\nThe 5 year strategic review, started last year and reviewed at the\nlast trustee board meeting, is soon\nto be published. If elected, I would\nensure the targets set by this document are met by the union. Vote for\nme to ensure the union remains on\ntarget.\nHitesh Hassani Chandershekh\nH\nola Que pasa! I\u2019m a\nSpindian (Spanish-Indi-an) ChemEng guy and I\nwant to be your Student\nTrustee.\nThe most important part of a university is its students, and it is my\nbelief that students should have\na greater say in decision making\nwithin the college and union, I believe your voice must be heard! The\ngoverning board of the union needs\nsomeone who is not afraid of stepping outside the boundaries in order to do what is right for you; I am\nthe person.\nI will always strive to support students in whichever which way I can\nand I assure you that if I were elected I would wholeheartedly bring forward your ideas and relay these to\nthe governing body so that all student needs and desires are met.\nI believe that students matter and\nI feel that this simple truth is sometime forgotten at Imperial College.

    "content": "FELIX\nFriday 02 MARCH 2012\n14\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nComment Editors: Tim Arbabzadah\nSam Horti\nCOMMENT\nFELIX\nO\nn Wednesday 14th March,\nChannel 4 will broadcast \u2018Sri Lanka\u2019s Killing Fields: War Crimes\nUnpunished\u2019 at 10.55\npm. The program is a sequel to the critically acclaimed and RTS-award winning\ndocumentary released last year, under a\nsimilar title, which shocked and horrified\nviewers worldwide. The documentary\nis set against a backdrop of brutal war\ncrimes and human rights violations by the\nSri Lankan Armed Forces, once alleged,\nnow confirmed by a report commissioned\nby the UN in 2011. The report concludes\nthat 40,000 Tamil civilians were killed\nin the final few weeks of Sri Lanka\u2019s 27\nyear civil war and that \u201cmost civilian\ncasualties in the final phases of the war\nwere caused by government shelling\u201d.\nThe panel who conducted the report,\nhowever, were barred by the government\nfrom entering Sri Lanka during the 10\nmonth period over which they gathered\nevidence. Upon release of the report political figures around the world, including\nDavid Cameron, demanded an \u201cindependent, international investigation\u201d. However, these calls have been repeatedly\nignored by the Sri Lankan government,\nwho continue to maintain that the war\nwas carried out with a zero-civilian casualty policy. The upcoming Channel 4\ndocumentary, and its predecessor, show\nhow urgently an independent investigation is really needed.\nThe documentary, a forensic investigation into the events of the final few\nweeks of Sri Lanka\u2019s civil war, was\nmeticulously put together after hours of\ntrawling through photographs, amateur\nfootage and videos recorded on mobile\nphones. The video evidence, recorded\nby both victims and Sri Lankan Army\nsoldiers, was described by Channel 4 as\n\u201csome of the most horrific footage it has\never broadcast\u201d. Whilst the documentary\nexamined the atrocities committed by\nboth sides, particularly disturbing were\nthe sexual assault of deceased Tamil Tiger rebels and the systematic execution\nof bound prisoners by the Sri Lankan\nArmed Forces. The program also detailed\nthe government\u2019s shelling of areas that it\nhad previously declared \u201csafe-zones\u201d,\nwhich raises the question of whether\nthe military operation had indeed been\nan orchestrated act of genocide against\nSri Lanka\u2019s Tamil minority. Sri Lanka\u2019s\nKilling Fields was screened at the UN in\nGeneva and New York and also shown to\npoliticians in the House of Commons, the\nEuropean Parliament and various members of the US Senate. Whilst the program triggered strong reactions around\nthe world, condemning the actions of Sri\nLanka\u2019s security forces, the perpetrators\nhave yet to be brought to justice.\nThe upcoming sequel contains conclusive new evidence, which points to the\ninvolvement of officials at the very top\nlevels of both the Sri Lankan army and\ngovernment. \u2018War Crimes Unpunished\u2019\nfocuses on four main areas: the deliberate bombardment of civilians and even a\nhospital in the so called \u201cNo Fire Zone\u201d,\nthe humanitarian blockade to starving\nand wounded civilians already trapped\nin dire conditions in the conflict zone,\nthe slaughter of civilians escaping the\nconflict zone (despite the Sri Lankan\nArmy saying it was mounting a \u201crescue\nmission\u201d) and summary executions of\nstripped and bound prisoners, including\nhaunting video footage of a 12 year old\nSri Lanka\u2019s Killing Fields\nboy who has been executed. It also asks\nquestions of those still ruling the coun-try. Shocking new evidence suggests that\nsome in the highest tiers of command\nwere complicit in crimes against human-ity, including the current President Mahinda Rajapakse, his brother, Defence\nSecretary Gotabhaya Rajapakse, and two\nformer army generals who have been\nmade diplomats and gained immunity\nsince the conclusion of the war.\nWith England\u2019s cricketers set to tour\nthe island this month and Sri Lanka\nconfirmed as the venue for the coming\nCommonwealth Heads of Government\nmeeting in 2013, this documentary is an\nopportunity for the international community to press for an independent, international investigation and a chance\nfor some form of justice for Sri Lanka\u2019s\nTamil community, who have been failed\nand forgotten by the world.\nIf you would like to take action please\nsign the e-petition, titled \u201cIndependent,\ninternational investigation into war\ncrimes in Sri Lanka\u201d on http://epeti-tions.direct.gov.uk/petitions/14586.

Then\nhead over to\nfelixonline.\nco.uk to get\nyour voice\nheard.\nVisakan\nBalalumar\nIt can only be election season. College\nis at the mercy of constant flyering, its\nwalls plastered with the faces of candidates hoping to take on the various positions of responsibility that are available for those keen enough to seek them\nout. After a solid week of campaigning,\nopinions are invariably going to differ\nacross college in a wide number of re-spects: is it just for the CV? Do candidates even know what they are running\nfor? As ever, year on year, these questions will be asked of the candidates.\nIf anything, people can now be held\nto account with greater ease than ever\nbefore, and such questions as those\npreviously listed will become less and\nless redundant as individuals are held\nto greater scrutiny. The advent of Twitter\nespecially allows a constant barrage of\nquestions for candidates who are willing to answer, public for all to see. It is\nthe immediacy and urgency of hustings\ntaken to the next step of its natural pro-gression, and allows those interested to\nengage with candidates instantly.\nOf course, saying that, it is a shame\nthat this year\u2019s hustings (outside of the\nfaculty unions\u2019) were not held in a public\nplace, such as last year in FiveSixEight.\nMeeting your critics face to face affords\nthe option to bring across more personality in your answers, and allows for an\ninstant view into the thoughts of many\nof Imperial\u2019s voters. Merely sitting in\na closed-off studio with one individual\nleading a smaller and more intimate interrogation does not bring across the\nsame form of College-wide emphasis\nthat these elections should really be\naiming for, rather viewing the live broadcasted hustings back gives the impression of a very small and very contained\nevent.\nHowever, there is no denying that the\naudience that the live broadcast has\nthe potential to command is far greater\nthan that allowed by hustings. The cost\nof this with regards to a personal touch\nmust be considered.\nAt the very least, I can take this opportunity to offer some insight for those\ncandidates running for Felix Editor.\nMake sure you are prepared for a year\nunlike any other. Late nights, balancing\ncommunication with a vast amount of\npeople across College and outside of\nit, and racing against an ever encroaching deadline that will just, never, ever\ngo away. All that being said, it\u2019ll be a\nfantastic year.

In fact, you\u2019re not\neven sure why you know them anymore. Everytime\nyou hang out with them you find your brain warning\nyou, with fundamentalist zeal, \u201cGet the fuck out of\nhere before I cut off the oxygen to myself\u201d.\nQuantic & Alice Russell are two of the UK\u2019s\nfinest, if the not the finest, independent artists.\nBoth release through the sublime Brighton label\n\u2018Tru Thoughts\u2019. Since the millenium they\u2019ve been\ncarving out a space away from the mainstream of\nBritish music for soul, funk, gospel and blues. And\nmy god is that space a good place to be.\nThe album whisks you off to all corners of the\nglobe, with \u2018I\u2019d Cry\u2019 leaving me with flowers in my\nhand outside a Cuban restaurant, stood up by my\nlong-legged Habanera date; with \u2018Travelling Song\u2019\ndropping me slumped drunk in a New York jazz\nbar; and \u2018Boogaloo 33\u2019 throwing legs and arms in\nall directions on some Ozzie beach.\nIt\u2019s the kind of music that I\u2019d love the director to\nuse when shooting the biopic of my life. Boys of a\ncertain age who have read Jack Kerouac\u2019s On the\nRoad, or watched a Godard film or two, are prone\nto bouts of solipsism like this. Put more simply,\nwhen wandering the streets of Soho drunk, we fall\ninto the trap of narrating the night in our heads,\nwith suitably ostentatious imagery, and friends\ntransformed into \u2018characters\u2019 who are then blown\nall out of proportion. I should confess: I do this\nalmost all of the time. And from now on, whenever\nI imagine my life being a billion times cooler than\nit is (what\u2019s a billion times zero?), Quantic, Alice\nRussell, and the Combo Barbaro will play on in\nmy head.\nI\u2019ll end by beseeching you to dive into \u2018Tru\nThoughts\u2019\u2019 back catalogue. There\u2019s gem after gem;\nit\u2019s perhaps the best independent label this side\nof the millenium. This latest release, Look Around\nthe Corner, does credit to their record of putting\nout great music, and its title is wonderfully suggestive \u2013 softly prodding the UK public to check\nout what\u2019s going just down their street beneath\nthe ostentation of modern pop.\nI\u2019ll confess, this album isn\u2019t actually out yet \u2013 it\u2019s\nout on the 2nd of April.

    "content": "FELIX\nFriday 09 MARCH 2012\n26\nfilm.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFilm Editors: John Park\nLucy Wiles\nFILM\nTwo spies who love me\nWith a love triangle that is as impossibly good looking as this one, it\u2019s difficult to know which pair to root for. But\nto put things simply, it\u2019s a showdown\nbetween a young James Bond (Hardy)\nand a young Ethan Hunt (Pine) who\nare also best friends. \u201cI know that you\nwould take a bullet for me, I would for\nyou as well.\u201d Awwwww. Their bro-mance is shown in none other than a\nloud, kinetic action scene on the rooftop\nof a tall Hong Kong tower, something\ndirector McG (Terminator: Salvation)\nshould be familiar with. But it\u2019s nothing special, with a modest scale that\nseems to be a waste on the two talented\nyoung actors. And just from watching\nthe first ten to fifteen minutes or so of\nuninspired, highly ordinary footage, we\nimmediately begin to worry whether\nthe rest of the film will be as mediocre.\nThings get more interesting however,\nfor both the leading men and the audi-ence, when Witherspoon enters the pic-ture. As her bright and perky unlucky-John Park\nDirector McG\nScreenwriters Timothy Dowling,\nSimon Kinberg, Marcus Gautesen\nCast Reese Witherspoon, Thomas\nHardy, Chris Pine\nThis Means War\nin-love Lauren appears, it\u2019s no more a\nnice bromance, but a full-on war, hence\nthe title. A slight misunderstanding involving a blind date and a chance encounter at a video rental store, the two\nmen meet her within minutes, and are\ncompletely taken by her. Witherspoon,\nthe talented comic actress who can do\nthis kind of simple role in her sleep, is\neffective in showing us just why these\ntwo tough guys are bending over backwards to impress her. The snarky, sly\ninterception of various dates begins,\nwith the two spies, who have access to\nplenty of CIA\u2019s most advanced resourc-es, smartly outdoing one another in the\nmost spectacular ways. It\u2019s a nonsense\nscrewball comedy, worked to maximum\neffect with the occasional action added.\nA part of what makes this such a\nwatchable experience is the entirely\nconvincing chemistry Hardy shares\nwith Pine. They\u2019re cheeky, funny, and\nseem uninhibited as they appear scene\nafter scene bickering like two immature\nlittle boys. As they spy on Lauren she\nhas no problem sharing all the intimate\ndetails of her two relationships to her\nblunt gal-pal confidant Trish (Chelsea\nHandler). FDR (Pine) has small and\ndelicate hands \u2013 and this has more troubling implications, and Tuck (Hardy) is\nBritish \u2013 which apparently means the\nsame thing. Hilarity ensues as the two\nspies are powerless to stop her.\nIt\u2019s not all about the bromance how-ever: because Witherspoon is paired\nwith a priceless comedic supporting comedienne Handler. Her dialogue is rich\nwith dry, sarcastic and sexually charged\nzingers, and with her deadpan delivery of the well-written lines, she is an\ninvaluable addition to the already impressive cast. This allows Witherspoon\nroom to develop her character more and\nalthough Handler\u2019s role may be plagued\nwith predictable clich\u00e9s of a borderline\nalcoholic, sex-obsessed, middle-aged\nwoman, the fact that she adds a whole\nlot more quality laughter into the film\nworks out as a massive plus.\nDespite the obvious humour that\ndrives a lot of the film\u2019s first half,\nthe script also remains faithful to the\nmore romantic side of the two sets of\nrelationships. FDR, the womanising,\nclub-hopping playboy who lived on\none-night stands, is actually thinking\nof settling down with the girl who he\nis truly taken aback by. Tuck, reeling\nfrom his divorce and struggling to connect with his son whilst having to deal\nwith the cold-shoulder treatment from\nhis ex, also finds something deep and\nmeaningful during his time with Lauren. Yes, there is nothing romantic, ethical or legal about how these two spies\nconstantly have their eyes on this woman by spending some hi-tech valuable\nnational resources \u2013 but this is McG\u2019s\nworld. It\u2019s not supposed to be taken too\nseriously. And once you get past the\nissue regarding invasion of privacy, it\nturns into an entertaining romp.\nWith appealing leads, McG sustains\nthe intrigue surrounding his love triangle but where he fails to truly impress\nis with his action scenes which never\nfind enough momentum. As a subplot,\nthese two CIA agents manage to anger a\ndangerous mobster. And surprise, Lauren gets caught in the middle of something deadly. What follows is a highly\nunsatisfying car chase, followed by one\nanti-climactic shoot-out in which Lauren makes her ultimate decision, all too\nsoon, with a far too convenient solution to give everyone a happy ending.\nIt will make you cringe, but because of\nits consistent build-up, ultimately it\u2019s\nan ideal film for a brainless night-out.\nI spy...with my little eye...something beginning with H...\nTotal mayhem and carnage... just your average night at Metric\nLucy Wiles\nDirector Nima Nourizadeh\nScreenwriters Matt Drake, Michael\nBacall\nCast Thomas Mann, Oliver Cooper,\nJonathan Daniel Brown\nProject X\nA distinctly unfunny teen-exploitation\ncomedy about an epic all-night party that\nquickly collapses into anarchy, Project X\nalso is a clever kind of clean page; viewers can project whatever feelings they\nhave about the degenerative behaviour\non display, since the film itself offers\nvery few opinions. In that way, producers manage to provide a cultural, generational and even political theme to debate,\none that will captivate a portion of the\nteenage demographic it shows, just as\nit alternately angers, infuriates and disgusts other, probably older, audiences.\nFrom watching the film, several questions are raised. Firstly: have teenagers\nalways been this moronic, or does Project X set new boundaries? Secondly:\ndid earlier generations approach having\na good time with such serious planning\nand forethought? And thirdly: does this\nfilm set the standard for the nausea-in-ducing use of the unsteady cam \u2013 possibly the MOST ANNOYING filming\ntype ever.\nThe premise, admittedly, is hugely un-original. Like all the other many films\nof this type, the motivating factor in the\nscreenplay by first-timer Matt Drake and\nMichael Bacall (Scott Pilgrim vs. the\nWorld, the soon to be released 21 Jump\nStreet) is the urgent and uncontrollable\nneed for teenage boys, specifically of the\ngeekish persuasion, to get laid. In this\ntale, this is exactly what lanky nice guy\nThomas (Thomas Mann) would like for\nhis 18th birthday, so plans are hatched\nfor an epic, lady-filled blowout the night\nhis parents leave town for the weekend\u2026you can see the problems arising\nalready.\nUnfortunately, taking control of things\nis Thomas\u2019 pal Costa (Oliver Cooper),\na rude, crude, grubby little creep who\nignores rules \u2013 notably those laid down\nby Thomas to do with limiting the party\nto two or three dozen guests and not allowing them in the house. Costa keeps\nreassuring Thomas that everything will\nbe fine, and not to worry about it, while\nmaking sure drugs will be widely available courtesy of a horrifically unsavory\ndealer. In another movie, you could\nimagine Costa could have been a funny,\nover-the-top character, always goading\nhis pal into ever-more-risky territory;\nhere, as adamantly enacted by Cooper,\nhe\u2019s just loathsome, venal and without\nhumor, and that he pointedly identifies\nhimself as Jewish won\u2019t endear him to\nguardians of the religion\u2019s reputation.\nThe format is predictable, but what\nProject X does manage to do is remove\nall the usual elements of cuteness from\nthe equation; being a nerdy teenager\nhas always involved a certain amount\nof awkwardness, angst and anxiety, but\nthere usually is some fun attached, and\nthe usual teen films tap into that nearly\nuniversal insecurity and apprehension\nconnected to the rites of passage. Here,\nthere is none of that \u2013 the desperation\nlevel is too high; it\u2019s all about getting\nbooze, getting drugs, getting sex, and\nall immediately. Or, as Costa says, \u201cTonight\u2019s about changing the game.\u201d\nProject X was supposedly inspired by\na similar event in Australia a few years\nback when, thanks to a moronic Facebook post, hundreds of people turned up\nfor a house party, resulting in uncontrollable mayhem and madness\u2026and a bill\nfor the parents of thousands of aussie\ndollars. In Project X, after a slow and\nslightly tedious start, it seems like everyone in North Pasadena between the ages\nof about 16-18, plus a few older partygoers and a bunch of younger hopefuls,\nhas gathered at Thomas\u2019 house for a\nparty of awesome proportions. The DJs\npound classics into the calm neighbour-hood, the alcohol flows all too freely,\nslutty girls strip off and jump in the pool,\nan unsuspecting dog is sent airborne via\nmultiple balloons, a pi\u00f1ata spills Ecstasy tablets, all morals and inhibitions\nfade, Thomas\u2019 parents Mercedes ends\nup underwater, and the drug dealer turns\nup with a flame thrower. They meant it\nwhen they said awesome proportions.\nAmazingly (and somewhat unrealisti-cally), the cops only visit once and leave\nafter they are turned away by some legal\nchitchat from Costa, who aspires to be\nlawyer. Eventually, however, the party\nbecomes major media news even as it\ncontinues, which is all it takes to justify\nits existence in this day and age.\nThe ending concludes with the boys\ndefinitely feeling the life-changing consequences that must be paid for their\ndelinquency. However, the filmmakers\nstill imply that, even if they do nothing\nfurther of any use in their whole lives,\nthey\u2019ll always have this one massive\nevent; here lies the problem of the film\u2019s\nlack of point-of-view, leaving it to the\nviewer to decide if the party was a good/\nbad/absolutely horrific thing.\nAesthetically, the film just does your\nhead in, unless you can cope with the\nnausea that comes with \u2018home-cinema\u2019\neffect filming. Under the pretext that a\nraver is filming the party, first-time director Nima Nourizadeh and cinematographer Ken Seng swing the camera\naround repeatedly and unfortunately\ninduce a strong feeling of seasickness.\nThe images tend to be dark and random,\nthe music incessant; this is certainly not\nthe film to see when hungover, or with\na headache. From a production point of\nview, the set is such carnage that you\nmust imagine the vast amount of clearing up for retakes would be horrendous.\nAnd where on earth was the movie shot\nso as not to bother the neighbours?!\n\u201cHave teenagers always been this moronic?\u201d\n\n"

On my\nquest of the past few years to find new and ever-better alternative music I\u2019ve learnt that you tend\nto find all the best bands somehow clumped together and the goody bag labelled \u2018Big Scary Monsters\u2019 is a prime example of this. Despite it being a\none-man independent jobby, for some reason the\nmajority of genuinely good UK-based alternative\nbands are affiliated with this label. Many of the\nbands signed to BSM are not in any way hardcore\nand so if you are more partial to softer indie music then I would strongly recommend checking out\ntheir collection because it\u2019s a blinder. That said,\nthe post-hardcore bands are amazing too, Shapes\nbeing one of them. This trio are again from Birmingham and formed in early 2008. Releasing\ntheir first EP just five months later, the band had\nalready gained attention amongst hardcore fans\nand this response to their music escalated. Just\nanother seven months later and they had been\nsnapped up by BSM and recording EP number\ntwo, The Pasture, The Oil. After it\u2019s release in\nMay 2009, their fan base grew far wider and even\n\u2018Zankyo Records\u2019 in Japan wanted a piece of the\naction. The next couple of years saw them tour\nwith the incredible Glassjaw and Pulled Apart By\nHorses before recording their debut full-length\nwith Eskil Lovstrom of Refused fame. This album,\nMonotony Chic, was again met with ubiquitous and\nwell-deserved critical acclaim. Shapes are known\nfor their explosive sound both live and on record.\nThis sheer aggression is then met with calculated\noff-beat rhythm and intricate guitar work to make\nsomething which is not only fascinating but phenomenal to listen to. If it\u2019s possible, the music\nis even better live when it\u2019s being smashed into\nyour ears by three Brummie men losing their shit\non stage. As I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll be pleased to know,\nthis band is actually still together and they gig in\nLondon often. Their next show is 17 March at the\nWilmington; you better be there.\nWriter\u2019s Recommendations\nWatch the video for \u2018Trampled By A Horse\u2019.

The song is filled with\nvoices of those that died making a stand \u201cWell,\nI was killed in 1963 one Sunday morning in\nBirmingham\u201d/ \u201cWell, I died last year crossing\nthe southern desert\u201d. Their spirits, however,\nlive on and their \u201csouls will rise to carry the\nfire and light the spark\u201d.\nWrecking Ball is no Born To Run or Born In\nThe USA. Personally, I would place it somewhere between The Rising and Magic, labelling it as one of Springsteen\u2019s best albums during the past 20 years. It\u2019s so amazing to see a\n62-year-old rocker carrying the same spark he\nhad when he was performing in Asbury Park\n40 years ago. Having been experiencing with\nvarious music types and singing, he presents a\nstunning piece of work which combines rock,\nfolk-rock, gospel and even hip-hop elements.\nAlthough not an original E Street Band record,\nthe production by Ron Aniello, joined together\nabout 40 musicians, including many guest performers - Tom Morello plays electric guitar in\ntwo songs \u2013 creating a solid album that came\nto remind us that Bruce Springsteen, living\nthrough his 4th career decade, has so much to\nsay, so beautifully.\ners\u201d, \u201cthe fat cats\u201d, \u201cthe greedy thieves\u201d who\ndestroyed everything and their actions were\nleft unpunished. Different characters arise,\nsimilar to each other, sharing the same feeling of anger and disgust. They seek salvation\nand cleansing through criminal methods \u2013 Is\nthis where we\u2019re heading? At that point \u2018The\nDepression\u2019 reveals the vulnerability of the\nworking man. Hope is long, long gone and all\nthe narrator needs is the love of his companion\nduring these hard times.\nThe other half of the album has a more upbeat tone. \u2018Wrecking Ball\u2019 sets the \u201cimage\nwhere something is destroyed to build something new\u201d. The optimism is carried on on\nwhat I think is the best song on the album,\n\u2018Land Of Hope And Dreams\u2019. Containing\nelements of Curtis Mayfield\u2019s \u2018People Get\nReady\u2019 and demonstrating Springsteen\u2019s Catholic upbringing, the song marks the movement\n\u201cfrom guys who are really very angry to guys\nwhow are angry but constructive\u201d. The song\u2019s\nspiritual intro followed by Steven Van Zandt\u2019s\nmagical mandolin and Big Man\u2019s emotional\nsaxophone moment join perfectly with Springsteen\u2019s passionate voice and meaningful lyrics.\nThe album closes with the uplifting \u2018We Are\nB\nruce Springsteen is finally back.\nAfter the unfortunate death of\nhis long-time friend and music\ncompanion, saxophonist Clarence Clemons, the Boss has been\npreparing for the release of his 17th studio album titled Wrecking Ball packed with a tour\nacross the US and Europe starting late March.\nFor those of you not belonging in the hardcore fans of Springsteen you may have the image of an American wearing a red bandana and\nsinging a patriotic anthem called \u2018Born In The\nUSA\u2019 back in the 80s. This is not what Bruce\nSpringsteen has been for the past 40 years of\nhis career; at least not just that. His music has\nbeen inspired by figures like Bob Dylan and\nElvis and has also been a great inspiration\nfor fellow New Jerseyan Bon Jovi, the Foo\nFighters and many more. Springsteen\u2019s work\nhas always been about \u201cjudging the distance\nbetween American reality and the American\ndream \u2014 how far is that at any given moment.\u201d as he mentioned at a press conference\nheld in Paris mid-February.\nFrom the iconic Born To Run and the struggle to escape from a dead town, to the massive\nhit album Born In The USA inspired by the\npain and despair the Vietnam War brought to\nthe Americans, to The Rising and its elevating\nspirit after the 9/11 hit, Springsteen has always\nembedded in his music and lyrics traits of the\nAmerican society, backing up the blue-collar\nguy, judging those responsible for the decline\nof his hometown, for the constant fading of the\nAmerican Dream.\nWrecking Ball is an album inspired by the\nlatest financial and socio-economic crisis.\nThe album opens with \u2018We Take Care Of Our\nOwn\u2019. The artist assesses the current situation\nof his homeland before he strikes the listener\nwith a series of questions the rest of the album\ntries to answer:\n\u201cWhere\u2019s the love that has not forsaken me\nWhere\u2019s the work that\u2019ll set my hands, my\nsoul free\nWhere\u2019s the spirit that\u2019ll reign rain over me\nWhere\u2019s the promise from sea to shining\nsea\u201d\nThe next few songs, \u2018Easy Money\u2019, \u2018Shackled And Drawn\u2019, \u2018Jack Of All Trades\u2019, \u2018Death\nTo My Hometown\u2019 take a look at the injustice\nthat has surrounded the actions of \u201cthe bank-Bruce wants to know why you haven\u2019t bought the album It was out March 5th!\nIs Springsteen still the Boss?\nMichael Krestas finds reason to celebrate with the release of Wrecking Ball\nMissing breakfast inspiration? Give ear-on-toast a try\nIn other news...\nThe supergroup Gorrillaz have released an accompanying video\nto their Converse-promoting song, DoYaThing. The song, featuring\nthe incredible talents of James Murphy and Andre 3000, has\nbeen cut down from its epic thirteen minute duration to a more\nYouTube-friendly five-or-so minutes. Covering the mundane activity of getting up in a morning in less-than-ordinary house (think\ngimps, bowls of ears and a bus-sized creature laying on the roof),\nthe video is an animated marvel. But to appreciate the song properly hunt out the unabridged version.\n\n"

After the\nintense coding, the participants returned\nagain very early on the Sunday morning\nto continue on their project with intensity and vigor.\nDevelopment of the application culminated with a pitch in front of judges\nfrom JP Morgan, Facebook, Imperial\nInnovations, and student entrepreneur\nand alumnus of Imperial College Milen\nDzhumerov. Nine teams presented their\nwork and each idea was not only fascinating but also intriguing in its applica-tion. Two teams developed applications\nunder the names Imperial Foodie and\nIEAT to assist in the digitization for the\npurchase and payment of food using\nour swipe cards. If such a system were\nimplemented, students would be able\nto purchase food much more easily and\ntrack their eating habits. This, however,\nwasn\u2019t the most innovative of the ideas\nas Duke University and California Institute of Technology (Caltech) have already been at the forefront of digitizing\nBUSINESS & FINANCE\nFELIX Friday 09 MARCH 2012 13\nImperial College Hackathon launched\nI\nmperial College has one of the\nbest Computing and Electrical\nEngineering Departments in the\nWorld, producing the most disciplined and talented software developers and programmers consistently.\nThese programmers often benefit from\nhigh salaries and fabulous perquisites\nfrom their employers. Imperial College prides itself on this monumental\nachievement. However, students often\nobserve the lack of ambition for entrepreneurship and technological innovation among Computing Undergraduates\n\u2013 please correct me if I am wrong.\nTo this rather depressing phenom-enon, I have attributed many reasons.\nThere is no incentive for undergraduates\nto become innovative or entrepreneur-ial, and the bureaucracy that exists in\nImperial College stops any such move-ment. The administrators are unwilling to help and they themselves do not\nhave any incentives to help either. This\nhas been exemplified by possibly high\ncatering prices on weekends that clubs\nand societies cannot pay for and many\ndifficulties in booking venues (it would\nhave been very convenient for the participants of Imperial College Hackathon\nto have stayed in the venue after 11pm\nto continue coding rather than being dismissed by a security guard). In addition,\nthere is no major software or investment\nbanks led challenges or competitions in\nImperial. In Imperial College, there is\nincredible number of talented students\nand they are just not given the chance\nto excel.\n\u201cHackathon is es-entially the culture\nthat built Facebook,\nGoogle and Micrsoft\u201d\nTo circumvent this problem and accelerate entrepreneurship in Imperial\nCollege, Imperial Innovation launched\nImperial Digital Accelerator on January 19th to \u201cfacilitate entrepreneurship\nin the digital space at Imperial College\u201d.\nImperial Digital Accelerator aims to\nprovide funding, mentorship and legal\nand accounting advice. They are organizing seminars with serial and student\nentrepreneurs to provide real examples\nof how technological innovations and\nentrepreneurship proceeds as an undergraduates or as a postgraduate.\nThis, however, was largely a departmental effort and we still noticed lack\nof student effort in such technological innovation. The Imperial College\nHackathon committee hence decided to\norganize the first ever Imperial College\nHackathon on 25th and 26th of February\nsponsored by JP Morgan, Facebook and\nImperial Innovations. Hackathon is essentially the culture that built Facebook,\nGoogle and Microsoft, and Hackathon\u2019s\nessence is summarized in its first five\nletters: HACKA. Each letter captures\none element of the event: (H- Hidden\nNeeds; A- Associational Thinking; CCracking code; K- Killer concept; AAction Now).\nOn Saturday morning sixty software\ndevelopers gathered in 060ABC Skempton Building. They were obviously very\nexcited and the organizers could sense\nthe excitement of participants whether it\nwas induced by redbull or genuine en-thusiasm. We also had engineers from\nboth Facebook and JP Morgan, a technology associate and digital accelerator\nmanager from Imperial Innovations to\noverlook the event. Simon Cross from\nFacebook explained why Hackathon\nwas such a central part of Facebook and\nthe achievements that it has made such\nas the development of Timeline and\nmany other applications.\nFueled by presentation by Facebook\nand JP Morgan, software developers\nfrom various parts of Imperial College\nLondon and other universities gathered\nand started to develop applications\nbased on the theme \u201cImproving Imperial College.\u201d With free pizza in one\nhand and the other hand on the key-board, programmers in groups of six\nor seven developed their applications\nfrom morning to dawn. The developers\nstudent activities with their swipe cards.\nBefore lectures start, we often have\ntrouble printing off materials due to\noverloading of the system and inefficient system that the ITC team has built\nfor our college. In addition, there has\nbeen increase in the use of tablets and\nlaptops in the lecture theatre to assist\nour learning. The two teams that won\nthe Imperial College Hackathon developed an application that allowed instantaneous uploading of relevant lectures\non each day. This removes the need to\nprint lectures every day and the need\nto download lecture notes from black-board. The application automatically\ndelivers the relevant lecture notes every day based on your course, date and\nlocation. Such an application enhances\nand accelerates the digitization of learning materials and eliminates the need\nto actually attend a lecture. The second\nteam developed an application named\nHEATNOTE that allowed live visual\npresentation of materials that were not\nunderstood in the lecture. Such a system\nallows for the lecturer to identify which\npart he has to re-clarify and this system\ndoes not stop the flow of the lecturer\nat all. This winning team received five\nhundred pounds in cash and praise from\ndevelopers. Other teams also developed\nfantastic websites and applications such\nas News4D and IMPEK that could be\nused immediately.\nThe first Imperial College Hackathon\nwas not only successful, but also invigorating for organizers to watch. Both participants and sponsors were surprised by\nthe originality of ideas and how much\nthey could actually do in a limited time\nof 24 hours. Now the participants have\nto move their ideas forward to make it\ncommercial and implementable in a\nschool environment. This would definitely need help from both the faculty\nmembers of all departments and admin-istrators. Without their help all these\nfantastic ideas would be buried and\nwould never rise again. If the administrators could only help to push such\ntechnological innovations in our school,\nImperial College Undergraduates and\nPostgraduates would become more and\nmore innovative and entrepreneurial,\nand that will tremendously benefit our\nschool. This could possibly happen by\narranging meetings between participants\nof Hackathon and ICT department, and\nhaving the Rector push our ideas.\nAfter Imperial College Hackathon,\nFacebook and JP Morgan took all the\ncontact details of the participants to\npossibly recruit all these talented participants to their firm. Imperial Digital\nAccelerator took in three teams to its\nprogram to provide mentorship and fi-nance. JP Morgan and Facebook and\nother software companies are willing to\nsponsors this event next year. In fact JP\nMorgan wants to have their own Hackathon with Imperial College students\nafter the success of our event. Next\nyear, the event will be not only bigger,\nbut better. You better join it or you will\nregret it.\nBob Xu\nApplications abound as students take to their screens, writes Sangjin Lee\n\u201cBoth participants\nand sponsors were\nsurprised by the originality of ideas...\u201d\nSecurity at the event was tight, but the guy in the hat still managed to wander in for the nibbles\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX\nFriday 09 march 2012\n16\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nComment Editors: Tim Arbabzadah\nSam Horti\nCOMMENT\nI\nn last week\u2019s Felix, I had intended\nto publish an article which exposed\nwhat I believe are serious problems\nwith Imperial\u2019s Careers Advisory\nService. It detailed how the service\nhas been susceptible to privatisation, it explained why so much of our career advice\nis just advertising for the financial sector\nand it criticised the College for allowing\nsuch an important service to become biased towards wealthy corporations.\nBefore the article could be printed, how-ever, a member of College staff emailed\nthe Felix editor asking him not to publish\nit. She said that it contained accusations\n\u201cwhich could be considered defamatory\u201d\nin its \u201cserious claims about a College\nservice and its staff\u201d. The email implicitly threatened Felix with legal action if it\nprinted the article. Understandably, it was\nnot published.\nThis raises very serious questions about\nthe independence of Felix, and its ability\nto report on mistakes, lies and corruption\nwithin the College.After all, what is a student newspaper for, if not to print stories\nlike the one in question? Are we simply\nmeant to paraphrase press releases from\nthe College and the Union? Are we nothing more than a long-winded advertisement for those with power?\nFreedom of the press, if it means any-Keep the Cat free!\nthing at all, means the ability to publicly\ncriticise authority. It means the ability for a\nwriter to publish inconvenient truths without fear of reprisal, and the ability for him/\nher to criticise anyone without the looming threat of legal action.\nWhenever I print an article or blog post\ncritical of a person or institution, I am\nasked why I did not raise the issue with\nthem privately beforehand. It is, they say,\neasier to solve problems without making\nthem public. This may be true, but I do not\nwrite about these issues simply because I\nwant them to be solved. I write also because I want to expose the behaviour of\nthose in power, and I want students to be\naware of the true motives of the people\nthey are supposed to trust. If all issues\nwere solved privately, then students would\nbe made ignorant of events about which I\nbelieve they have a right to know.\nImperial is a company like any other,\nand therefore seems to put its financial\nwellbeing ahead of the welfare of its stu-dents. Consider, for instance, the issue of\ncoursework feedback. Students had been\ncomplaining for years about the quality\nof the feedback, but it was not until Imperial\u2019s dramatic drop in the most recent\nUniversity league tables that the College\nactually did anything about the problem.\nSo it is with any such issue. Formally\ncomplaining, no matter how forcefully,\nwill not work. We must shout angrily in\nany way possible about how terrible the\nissue is. We must publish articles, write\nblogs, inform national newspapers. We\nmust attempt to give the College \u201cbrand\u201d a\nbad reputation, and thereby make ignoring\nour complaints financially unwise. And if\nthis means resorting to defamation then so\nbe it.\nThe importance of student journalism in\nthis uphill struggle should not be under-estimated. It is by far the best method we\nhave for rallying support behind a cause\nand, evidently, for troubling the estab-lishment. But when student journalism is\nsilenced, Universities can get away with\nanything. Who but Felix can constantly\nquestion Imperial\u2019s authority and actions?\nImperial College is a University of science and, as such, ought to be a place\nwhere criticism is accepted, and never si-lenced. If the College disagreed with my\narticle - even if they thought it was factually incorrect - they could easily have written a response to be printed the following\nweek. That is how debate works in newspapers and magazines. It does not work by\nbanning controversial writing.\nStudent newspapers, in particular, have\ntraditionally been the voice of opposition\nat Universities, but it appears that our\nWho but Felix can\nconstantly question\nImperial\u2019s authority\nand actions?\nuthority\nuthority\n?\n?\n\u201c\nWho bu\nWho bu\nconstan\nconsta\nUniversity would be happier if we printed\nonly those articles to which they had given\ntheir approval. What kind of newspaper\nbehaves in such a way? How would we\nreact if The Guardian only printed articles\nwhich had received the government\u2019s con-sent?\nIn the words of George Orwell, \u201cEverything in our age conspires to turn the writ-er, and every other kind of artist as well,\ninto a minor official, working on themes\nhanded down from above and never telling what seems to him the whole of the\ntruth.\u201d\nThis small battle has been lost, but we\nwill not be swayed by Imperial\u2019s apparent\nattempt to silence criticism. From now on,\nwe will seek out College scandals with renewed vigour, and we won\u2019t forget what\nthe role of the journalist really is: to speak\nthe truth to power.\nA fully referenced version of this article is\navailable at rustylight.blogspot.com\n[The views expressed in this piece and section are those of the author alone. The article in question was not published due to\nfactual inconsistencies. In order to clarify\nany misunderstanding, Felix will investigate claims made regarding the Careers\nAdvisory Service in the near future \u2013 Ed.]\nStephen Smith\nQueen\u2019s Tower Rooms\n18.00 Thursday 15 March\nFIND A FLATMATE\nFREE MINGLE EVENT\n\u00bb .FFU\u0003QPUFOUJBM\u0003lBUNBUFT\n\u00bb 4BGF \u0003TPDJBM\u0003FOWJSPONFOU\u0003\n\u00bb '3&&\u0003QJ[[B\u0003BOE\u0003TPGU\u0003ESJOL\u00d0\n\u00bb $BTI\u0003CBS\u0003BWBJMBCMF\n\u00bb /P\u0003BXLXBSE\u0003lBUNBUF\u0003AJOUFSWJFXT\b\n:PV\u0003NVTU\u00033471\u0003CZ\u0003UIJT\u0003'SJEBZ\u0003\u001a\u0003.\"3$)\u0003JO\u0003PSEFS\u0003UP\u0003BUUFOE\u0003UIJT\u0003FWFOU\n3471\u0003/08\u001b\u0003kOEBlBUNBUF!JNQFSJBM\u000fBD\u000fVL\nwww.imperial.ac.uk/accommodation\n\n"

    "content": "Reuben Margerison\nW\nhy should you vote\nReuben for Deputy\nPresident (Welfare)?\nBecause YOU\u2019RE\nworth it.\nThere are three main points that I\nwould fight for:\n1. Better CCTV\nWhen people think of South Kensington, they don\u2019t usually think \u2018crime\u2019,\nbut a large number of thefts occur on\ncampus, and one of the main reasons\nthat so few of these items are recovered is the poor quality CCTV. There\u2019s\nno point in having CCTV if you can\u2019t\nsee anything! Better quality CCTV is\nabsolutely necessary around campus,\nand something that I would fight for. It\nis a great shame that it is not already\nin place, to act as a deterrent to all\ncrimes, including theft and sexual\nassault.\n2. Fairer Accommodation\nAccommodation charges have increased across the whole of Imperial\u2019s halls at a rate way above market value. This is especially important\nfollowing the tragic announcement of\nthe closure of Clayponds. If elected, I\npromise to fight for the best value accommodation available, for both Postgraduates and Undergraduates, an\nissue which as a hall senior is close\nto my heart.\n3. Better Catering\nFood is a basic requirement, and on\ncampus there does appear to be a lot\nof choice. A closer look, however, reveals that the same sandwiches crop\nup in every caf\u00e9. A vote for me secures\na look at how we can improve the food\nacross campus, with exciting and importantly varied menus that cater for\nall tastes and dietary requirements.\nThe future\u2019s bright - the future\u2019s Reuben for Welfare.\nRebecca Lane\nM\ny name is Rebecca\nLane and I am a\nthird year physicist.\nI have had first-hand\nexperience of many\nof the problems faced by Imperial\nstudents and feel that I can build on\nexisting welfare policies.\nWe all know how much of a high\npressure environment Imperial can\nbe, and I am committed to making\nsure that students receive the highest possible level of pastoral care\nacross every department. There\nneeds to be an effective feedback\nmechanism regarding personal tutors and there should be staff in\nevery department committed to\nstudent wellbeing. I think there also\nneeds to be a more uniform peer\nsupport service from department\nto department. Some faculties have\nbuddy systems; I think there needs\nto be a robust model rolled out\nthroughout college.\nAside from departmental pastoral\ncare, I will campaign to further increase the resources of the Student\nCounselling Service, meaning any\nstudent feeling isolated gets help\nas promptly as possible. I will also\nraise awareness about help available to students to reduce the stigma attached to asking for support.\nI will also campaign to find a solution to the lack of bike storage,\nto provide basic bike tools in all\nlock-ups and continue to rally for a\nprepay top-up college card system\nfor purchasing food on campus.\nAs a third year student, I feel that\nI have the experience to represent\nundergraduates, but also the level\nof maturity to represent the voice of\npostgraduates at Imperial.\nSupport my welfare campaign,\nvote for Rebecca Lane.\nJack Hewitt\nF\nor the last year, as RAG\nchair, I\u2019ve chaired a management group of projects,\nrepresented them at the\nClubs and Societies Board,\nand been an active member of Union\nCouncil. I\u2019ve chaired the New Projects Committee (overseeing the creation of new student-run projects),\nwritten for Felix regularly, organised\nmetric nights, a successful Jailbreak,\nbike auctions with the current DPW,\nworked with all the Sabbatical Officers and Faculty Unions, significantly\nreduced RSMU\u2019s storage issues and\nsat on the Entertainments Committee. I\u2019m both very experienced and\ncommitted to the cause, having\nfaced massive problems with housing and as an international applicant\nwho\u2019d been to London twice before\nuni.\nIf elected I will-- Provide a housing guide giving\ninformation on basic housing law,\ncontracts and a blacklist of landlords\nand estate agents known to mistreat\nstudents.\n- Hold an alternative careers fair,\ngiving a different look at employment\n- Hold termly hall meetings, in every\nhall, to stay connected with Freshers\nand the problems they face\n- Make Smoking Quit-Kits readily\navailable to students\n- Hold monthly \u2018Sabbatical Surgeries\u2019 - Ensure buddies are assigned\nbefore Freshers\u2019 week, especially for\nInternational Students\n- Write regularly for Felix about the\nUnion, how it works and what it can\ndo for you\n- Set up a gym buddy system for the\ngyms on all campuses, both for Halls\nand course-mates\n- Reinvigorate Imperial Home Solutions to get more on there, photos\nand floorplans\n- Provide a list of student discounts\non the Union Website and in pre-arriv-al information, and budgeting advice\nBinayak Basnyat\nC\nourse: 3rd year Computing.\nProject Leader of volunteering group Project Nepal, IC Football team and\nDepartment of Computing\nSociety.\nHaving spent the past three years at\nImperial, I have had my share of prob-lems. The welfare system has helped\nme get through the intensive course\nthat all of us face. This has strengthened my belief to stand up for this\nposition to improve the system where\nneeded and take new initiatives to introduce preventive measures so that\neveryone can have an overall enjoyable experience.\n\u201cDepartmental Responsibility for Student Welfare\u201d\nLeaflets and posters are not enough.\n- Senior tutors to chase up students\nlagging behind which could be a result\nof various issues other than academ-ic. All students come here with 3 or\nmore A\u2019s and there should be no excuse for lagging behind.\n\u201cMore Volunteering Opportunities\u201d\nVolunteering can be one of the most\nrewarding ways to make a difference\nin local or international communities.\nI want to:\n- Make it easier for students to initiate new volunteering societies. (From\nfew months to 2 weeks)\n- Build new partnerships with volunteering organisations to fast track our\nstudents.\n- Promote new opportunities available via dedicated website.\n- Organise charity fundraising sports\ntournaments.\n\u201cTackle academic issues as preventive measures\u201d\n- Reading week for every course.\n- Scrapping midnight deadline.

    "content": "Once more I managed to wangle my way into\nwatching DramSoc\u2019s second spring term\nproduction, Can\u2019t Pay? Won\u2019t Pay!, Nobel\nlaureate Dario Fo\u2019s 1974 farcical comedy,\ninvolving pseudo-pregnant women, confused\nhusbands and a suspiciously similar-looking\nstring of police inspectors and undertakers. I\nwas promised a barrelful of laughs, and I certainly didn\u2019t leave empty handed.\nCP?WP! revolves around two frustrated\nhousewives, Antonia and Margherita (Sophie\nHernando Kofman & Sin\u00e9ad Ward), inciting\nchaos in their local supermarket and making\noff with a stack of goods. Life is far from sim-ple, and very quickly their husbands (played\nby Tommy Partl & Tom Cunningham) grow\nsuspicious. Cue a bizarre revolutionary policeman (Hasan Al-Farhan) and you have\na recipe for chaos (and hilarity!) as the two\nwomen do all they can to evade both arrest\nand the ire of their hubbies.\nIt sounds very weird at first \u2013 you might\nfear that a play about women stuffing bags of\nfruit and veg down their coats would struggle\nto remain fresh and funny throughout. Thankfully this was not the case as the energetic\ncast kept the script from falling flat and ensured the physical humour and over-the-top\nscenes were delivered with aplomb.\nIt\u2019s clear that the actors involved have been\nenjoying themselves during rehearsals. An\nadvantage of watching full performance rehearsals is that you get to see the little blips\nthat occur when there\u2019s not a large judging\naudience present. More than once the cast\nended up giggling during particularly exaggerated scenes, and it was great to see them\nstill enjoying their roles, even after weeks of\npracticing. The failure of Hasan\u2019s fake moustache to stay on his face didn\u2019t help matters\nmuch, though its repeated picking up and\nsticking back on only added positively to the\nfarce.\nEven with its low budget and small production team Can\u2019t Pay? Won\u2019t Pay! doesn\u2019t fail\nto impress. If you\u2019re suffering from Monday\nblues, this is the perfect remedy. But please,\nfor the sake of DramSoc\u2019s finances, don\u2019t\nstart holding up the front of house and begin\nstuffing tickets down your shirt.\nCan\u2019t Pay?

At the time of its\nrelease, it won three Golden Globes and an\nAcademy Award. It is surely a huge undertak-ing, then, to successfully bring a story with\nsuch pedigree to the stage. This is the challenge that ICSM Drama have set themselves\nthis term, and from what I\u2019ve seen, they have\nindeed been phenomenally successful.\nFor those who have seen neither the film\nnor stage adaptation, Some Like It Hot begins\nin 1929, where two musicians in a speakeasy\nwitness the Saint Valentine\u2019s Day massacre.\nStruggling to make money by finding work\nelsewhere, they disguise themselves as women\nin order to be part of an all female musical act\nand along with the rest of the group they make\ntheir way to Florida. On the journey and at the\ndestination much hilarity, of course, ensues.\nIt is very easy with the type of humour presented in the play to become complacent of\nHot? Or Imperial Hot?\nthe attention needed in all aspects of its per-formance, but there appear to be no signs of\nthis in the production. Staging is handled incredibly well and credit here must go to the\ndirectors, Tom Philips and Katherine Kennet.\nScenes of long dialogue are kept interesting\nand the pace never slows. Even violent scenes,\nwhich in many productions of this kind can\nappear childish, are handled extremely con-vincingly. Jonathan Buckley and Mike James\u2019\nportrayals of Jerry and Joe respectively must\nalso be mentioned. Cross-dressing and putting\non a silly voice is difficult at the best of times,\nbut not only is this managed rather naturally,\nboth actors give fantastically amusing perfor-mances.\nHowever, what really struck me with this\nplay was the entire ensemble\u2019s absolute attention to detail throughout. Not a single lapse in\ncharacterisation could be seen throughout the\nwhole performance, and the effort put in here\ngives the element of believability needed in\ncounterweight the plot\u2019s absurdity. The energy\nshown by the cast never lets up and for this all\nperformers deserve commendation.\nMany more words of praise could be written\nabout this play, but all comments boil down to\none simple thing: the play is incredibly enter-taining. Nothing has been lost in the transformation of this classic film onto the stage, and\nICSM Drama are on to a definite winner.\nSome Like It Hot runs from Wednesday 14\n\u2013 Saturday 17 March in the Union Concert\nHall\n\u201cThe energy shown by\nthe cast never lets up...\nall performers deserve\ncommendation\u201d\nICSM Drama set the stage alight with\na little cross-dressing and a lot of fun\n\u201cMore than once the cast\nended up giggling during\nexaggerated scenes\u201d\nBirmingham\u2019s attempt to match London Fashion Week fell a little short of the mark\nCode{poems} is a project calling on programmers\nto summon their creative energies and write poems entirely in code.

Gaming is a medium where one\ndoesn\u2019t just hire an attractive actress, but designs\na character from the ground up to be a walking\nsex object, with physics to control the jiggle of\neach individual breast (yes, really!). This is offensive not only to women, but to the men who\nplay games, suggesting that a real, developed female character is something we\u2019re not interested\nin. That\u2019s not to say there are none of these in\nThis isn\u2019t a great stereotype...\n...but let\u2019s be honest, neither is this one\nThey look content now, but wait until someone breaks their killing streak\nmainstream games \u2013 Alyx Vance from Half-Life\n2 is a scientist dressed in normal clothes; Samus\nAran from the Metroid game series is sexy without being sexist and wears armour that looks like\nit could deflect more than a raindrop. This seems\nto be largely overlooked by the community,\nthough, and the fact that these characters appear\nin countless \u201cvideo game babes\u201d lists (this publication included) is cause for some concern.\nI\u2019ve mentioned \u2018mainstream\u2019 gaming as, like\nfilms, there are big blockbuster games as well\nas smaller, artier \u2018indie\u2019 games. Unlike films,\nno game so far seems to have bridged the gap,\nand been a piece of artistic impression while\nalso appealing to a wide audience. Unlike any\nother media, games are unique in that they can\nuse the player\u2019s actions as part of the storytell-ing; the game mechanics themselves can be part\nof the plot and symbolism. My favourite example of this is Bioshock, which subverts its own\ngameplay to deliver a twist I can honestly say\nis better than any film I\u2019ve seen (and yes, I\u2019ve\nseen The Usual Suspects). Yet still, Bioshock is\na game largely about shooting people or hitting\nthem with a wrench. Its atmosphere is beautiful;\nits twist magnificently dealt, but its plot is little\nmore than \u2018objectivism is bad.\u2019 While games that\ncan be called works of art exist, there are not any\nwhich have a plot comparable to a good book\nor film. Is this because of a lack of good writers working for major game developers, fans who\ncannot enjoy a deep plot, or just that developers\nare afraid to release something that doesn\u2019t appeal to the lowest common denominator? I hope\nit\u2019s merely the latter. I\u2019m sure gaming can do bet-ter, but with the utter lack of sensible storyline or\nbelievable characters in any current blockbuster\ngames, it\u2019s going to take a long time. Gaming\nneeds its Dark Knight.\nFinally, the gaming community is self-entitled\nto an extreme. When a television series goes in\nthe wrong direction, critics will complain and\npeople will begrudgingly stop watching the\nshow. Usually, the series\u2019 earlier, good episodes\nare still fondly remembered. When a game series\nchanges, or an individual game fails to deliver on\npromises, the internet becomes filled with fans\u2019\nrage. For example, the recent announcement that\nMass Effect 3 will allow gay relationships (male,\nof course \u2014 otherwise there\u2019d be no complaint)\nhas resulted in several angry outbursts, the most\nridiculous being that the idea is non-canon \u2014 in\na roleplaying game, where you choose exactly\nwhom you want your character to be. One of\nmy favourite games, Team Fortress 2, was made\ncompletely free-to-play last June, nearly four\nyears after its initial release. Owners who bought\nthe game soon after its original release date received an in-game badge to show their \u2018veteran\u2019\nstatus, which provoked outrage. \u201cI paid for this\ngame,\u201d people complained, \u201cand all I get for it is\na badge?\u201d seemingly oblivious to the four years\nthey\u2019d spent playing it.\nOne could point out that such childish behaviour can be seen in any pub or football stadium,\nand they\u2019d be right. But gamers are seeking newcomers to the hobby, and for it to be recognised\nas a legitimate entertainment and art form. I mentioned the old stereotype of a gamer is breaking\ndown, but a new one is taking its place \u2013 that of\nself-absorbed lazy lads, doing nothing better than\nsitting around, drinking beer and playing on the\nXbox. If the gaming community\u2014 vocal, obnoxious and ever-present on the internet \u2014 wants to\nshake this image before it\u2019s too late, they\u2019ve got a\nlot of growing up to do.\n\n"

Losing a lot of players to work commitments left the 3rd XI with just 10 players.\nTo make up the numbers, Dirty Whaler and\nUdara stepped up to make the numbers.\nFollowing a great series of results (10-1,\n2-0, 3-0), the 3rd XI were full of confidence\nand raring to go. Stand-in captain Fritzl gave a\nrousing team talk reminding us that to win, we\njust needed to play simple hockey.\nThe first half was a timid affair, with neither\nteam dominating the game. IC were finding it\nhard to break down the Queen Mary\u2019s mid-field, while the opposition failed to find their\nway through the organised defence of Free\nWilly, Eager Beaver, Fritzl and Bum Tablet.\nSPORT\nFELIX\nFriday 09 march 2012\n38\nWeb: www3.imperial.ac.uk/sports\nFacebook: Search \u2018Sport Imperial\u2019\nTwitter: @SportImperial\nsport.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nSport Editor: Indy Leclercq\nChances were few and far between, with neither keeper making a save, with the 0-0 half\ntime score reflecting that.\nAt half time, the message was clear \u2013 attack\ndown the wings. IC had noted the frailties in\nthe Queen Mary full backs and decided to focus on exploiting this.\nIC began the second half well, with the\nwing wizards (Pappity-boopity, Cockerel\nand Fresher Ed) all tormenting the Queen\nMary\u2019s full backs, but the goal just would\nnot come. The pressure, however, did its job.\nQueen Mary\u2019s were on the back foot, which\nallowed for both Fresher Tom and Designer\nV to boss the midfield. Fresher Tom\u2019s flat\npasses out wide routinely stumped the Queen\nMary\u2019s midfield, while Designer V exploited\nthe spaces that were opening up. To consolidate this dominance, Eager Beaver and Fritzl\npicked up any scraps offered to the QM for-wards.\nThe breakthrough almost came within the\nfirst 10 minutes of the half, when Dirty Whaler broke through the QM defence and played\na neat 1-2 with Tharun, before squaring for\nFresher Ed, who contrived to miss the ball.\nSPORT\nFELIX\nsport.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nSport Editor: Indy Leclercq\nThis set back didn\u2019t deter IC for too long, and\nthey straight away found themselves in front.\nA great ball from Designer V found Dirty\nWhaler in space, before he arrogantly roofed\nthe ball into the top of the net, 1-0, and it was\njust about what IC deserved.\nThe QM midfielders were starting to get\nmore and more frustrated, and one of them\nfinally hit tipping point and was sent off for\nswearing at the ref. IC sensed an opportunity and pounced. Free Willy and Pappity\ncombined down the left to send Designer V\nthrough on goal to double the advantage and\nput IC in the ascendency.\nThe third goal came from a breakaway\ndown the right. QM packed into the IC D, but\na quick break from Bum Tablet saw him into\nthe opposition 25, where he squared for Tharun. Tharun\u2019s pass (which some would call a\nmis-hit) looped straight to Designer to slot in\nhis second, and IC\u2019s 3rd.\nA huge win over a team two leagues above\nthem (and the league above the Men\u2019s 2nds)\nsees the 3rds go second in Big Guns and potentially look to set up a final against the Medics 2nd XI.\nMen\u2019s 3rd 3\nQueen Mary 1sts 0\n\"I'd already done an internship here so\nI knew it was a great place to work.

I had visited the\nsite and talked with a few\npeople. I liked the way they focused attention on the how the current economic crisis is being handled. The camp\nhighlighted the close links between the\nCathedral and the City of London. Yet\nit also had wide support from local UK\nChurches. Their members feel the economic issues themselves and hear the\nstories of hardship from their partner\ncommunities in developing nations.\nThe existing systems of banking and\nregulation have led us to this place of\neconomic instability and rising inequal-ity. The world wide Occupy movement\nfocuses the demands of people around\nthe world for new thinking and new\nways of doing business, ways that offer some stability for our futures. Much\nof the outcry about recent bonuses for\nbankers at RBS comes from a sense that\nafter the greatest wake-up call in economic history nothing much seems to\nhave changed. Instead austerity, financial instability and increasing inequality\nseem to be all that is offered.\nStudent concerns about debts and employment options \u2013 and how these play\nout around the world - now feature in\nthe conversations we hear as Chaplains.\nIn a multi-faith team these concerns are\nseen within different religious frame-works. Our religious traditions have\nlong histories and have adapted to different economic systems over the cen-turies. Religions have views about the\npurpose wealth, and how to combine\njustice with our personal economic\nneeds. For example, Islamic banking\nasks fundamental questions about the\npurpose of money. In Hinduism there is\nthe idea that financial success needs to\nbe seen alongside true devotion if the\nsuccess is to bring goodness into life.\nThe Jewish idea of \u2018sabbath\u2019 questions the purpose and scope of work,\nwhile the idea of \u2018shalom\u2019 gives a holistic vision of prosperity. Christianity\nasks how the poorest are to share in\ngeneral prosperity.\nAt a time of economic uncertainty\nmaybe dialogue with the religious traditions about finance and business can\ngive an new angle to the debate. Students from Imperial Interfaith and the\nChaplaincy are bringing together a panel of people with varied experience of\nfinance and business. They will be invited to answer questions from students\nabout how their own faith engages with\ntheir business practice and what insights it offers for shaping the current\nsituation. Members of the panel are\ndrawn from the Hindu, Muslim, Jewish\nand Christian faith traditions. Alkesh\nPatel, is a trader and columnist for the\nFinancial Times. Tarek El Diwany was\nhead of the Islamic Finance department\nat Prebon Yamane in London and a\nbond trader. He now writes and consults\non Islamic banking and finance. Marcus\nBateman is Vice President of Corporate\nPayments for Barclays Corporate. His\ncurrent area of responsibility is Product\nManagement for Faster Payments. He\nis a Licensed Lay Minister (LLM) in\nthe Church of England. Maurice Ostro\nis Chairman of Ostro Minerals (UK)\nand Chair and founder of Fayre Share\nInvestments. He is also a trustee of the\nAnglo-Israel Association and the Council of Christians and Jews.\nThis is not about finding complete\nagreement. Religious communities\nhave good questions. Yet, like St Paul\u2019s\nthey cannot avoid their own involvement in the current systems. No one is\npretending that religious communities\nhave all the answers. Rather we want to\nwiden the debate about issues that affect\nall human beings. There is a sense of ur-gency. Religions with long memories \u2013\nlike political campaigners - know that\nif current practice is not reshaped with\njustice then those with the most power\nwill shape things for their convenience\nand at the expense of the majority.\nBusiness and Religion : In Dialogue\nThursday 15 March, 6:30-8pm in\nthe Business School LGS lecture\ntheatre.\nFor more see www.imperial.\nac.uk/chaplaincy or \u2018Imperial Interfaith\u2019 on Facebook.\nAndrew Fok\nThe relationship between religious traditions and business could provide a new angle to the Occupy movement\n\n"

    "content": "Scientists at the University of Oxford have\ndeveloped a pair of protein fragments dubbed\n\u2018SpyTag\u2019 and \u2018SpyCatcher\u2019 that form an incredibly strong bond. Within minutes of being brought into contact the protein fragments\nform a covalent bond so strong that when put\nunder pressure, the protein breaks away from\nthe apparatus before the bond breaks. It is effectively a biomolecular superglue \u2013 except,\ndue to its good specificity, without the possibility of accidentally sticking to the edge of the\ntest tube or other unwanted molecules.\nThe discovery was inspired by Streptococcus\npyrogenes, which causes infections ranging in\nseverity from sore throats to toxic shock syn-drome. The bacterium uses the FbaB protein\nto bind to human cells before invading. The\nparticular strength of this link is caused by\nthe protein\u2019s shape. Rather than simply being\nmade of a chain of covalently bonded amino\nacids held together by comparatively weak\nforces, FbaB forms amino acid loops which\nare subsequently held together by an additional\ncovalent bond. The team of scientists reasoned\nthat, if they were able to successfully engineer\nthe protein in such a way as to allow the creation of two separate fragments which would\nform this covalent bond again once brought\ntogether, the same mechanism could be used to\nattach other molecules to each other.\nThe bond is not only very selective, forming\nbetween SpyCatcher and SpyTag rather than\nany other molecule in the cell environment,\nbut it also forms in a large range of conditions.\nThe team successfully repeated the experiment\nStuck like superglue\nInspiring: Streptococcus pyogenes\nnot only at 37\u00b0C and neutral pH, mimicking a\nmammalian cell, but also at 4\u00b0C in high concentrations of detergent and under acidic con-ditions. This was true not only in vitro but also\nwhen tested inside Escherichia coli bacteria.\nThis development is a leap forward towards\nthe goal of being able to combine different\nproteins at will and with ease. Unlike previously discovered non-covalent equivalents,\nwhich can be broken by sufficient shear forces\nwithin milliseconds, the SpyCatcher:SpyTag\ncomplex cannot be broken by molecular mo-tors. Other existing approaches binding biomolecules using covalent bonds are similarly\nstrong but slow, associated with poor yields,\nor in need of reaction conditions hostile to\ncommon life forms.\nUnfortunately, unlike other mechanisms,\nSpyTag is not traceless. Also, the rate of bond\nformation between SpyTag and SpyCatcher\nis too slow to be effective inside living cells;\ndiffusion is likely to occur before bonding.\nWith further research and optimization, how-ever, we may soon see the dream of biological\nLego come true.\nDOI: 10.1073/pnas.1115485109\nMost women will at some point in their lives\nencounter the ticking biological clock: the realisation that their fertile years are limited,\nand if they wish to start a family, they cannot\nwait much longer. This is because we have\nonly the supply of oocytes or egg cells we\nare born with, and when they\u2019re gone, they\u2019re\ngone. At least that is the conventional view of\nhow the female reproductive system works.\nBut research published recently in Nature\nMedicine suggests that there may be more\ngoing on than we had previously realised.\nSeveral years ago a team of researchers,\nled by Jonathan Tilly at Harvard Medical\nSchool, studied the dynamics of ovarian follicles (which produce oocytes) in mice, by\nmeasuring the rate at which they mature and\nare released or simply die. They found that\nsomething did not add up. Given the measured rate of degeneration, there should have\nbeen few or no healthy follicles left by the\ntime the mice reached adulthood. However\nthis is not the case; like most animals mice\nretain reproductive potential throughout their\nadult lives. Further studies of the biochemical activity in the ovarian cells suggested an\nintriguing possibility. Was it possible, the researchers asked, that the follicles were actually being renewed, and producing new oo-cytes throughout the mouse\u2019s life, by rare and\npreviously unknown stem cells in the ovary?\nThis was a controversial suggestion which\ninitially met with some scepticism; however,\nsome years later such cells (oogonial stem\ncells, or OSCs) were indeed isolated from\nmouse ovary tissue, and shown to spontaneously generate new oocytes both in vitro and\nwhen injected into the ovaries of mice whose\nfertility had been destroyed by chemothera-py. The same mice went on to produce viable\noffspring. Similar results were achieved in\nrestoring the fertility of elderly mice.\nThe potential implications were clear: could\nthere be a similar mechanism in humans, and\nwould this allow us to develop new fertility treatments for women? Common causes\nof infertility include damage to the ovaries\nfrom chemotherapy or disease, or premature\nmenopause, when there are relatively few follicles leading to the supply of oocytes running out at a relatively early age. If the stem\ncells could effectively cure or reverse these\nconditions in mice, then why not in humans?\nThat was the question the recent research\nset out to answer. Applying similar techniques to tissue from human ovaries, they\nwere able to isolate what appeared to be the\nhuman equivalent of mouse OSCs. The human experiments did not go as far as the\nmouse ones, however. Ovarian tissue from\nhealthy young women is rarely available for\nresearch and in limited supply. In this case\nthe donors were transgendered and undergoing sex reassignment surgery, and had\nagreed for their ovaries to be used in this way\n\u2013 clearly an unusual set of circumstances.\nAdditionally there are serious ethical issues\naround fertilising human oocytes and creating embryos for research purposes. What the\nresearchers were able to do, however, was to\ntransplant human ovarian tissue containing\nhuman OSCs into mice. These were shown to\nproduce immature but healthy follicles, containing tiny new human oocytes.\nThe researchers advise caution however.\nThere is much work to be done and many\nquestions to be answered before there is any-possibility of OSCs becoming a tested and\nproven fertility treatment for humans. However the results are promising, and with infertility a major and growing problem in the\ndeveloped world particularly, any hope for\nwomen and couples facing this difficult situation will surely be welcomed.\nDOI: 10.1038/nm.2669\nSarah Byrne\nFELIX\nFriday 09 March 2012\n8\nscience.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nScience Editors: Kelly Oakes\nAlexander Karapetian\nSCIENCE\nIn brief\nAnnina Sartor\nA Japanese company has devised an unusual solution to help defend homes against earthquakes\n\u2013 involving levitation. While other disaster-resis-tant homes provide solutions such as using elastic iron to be able to move with an earthquake,\nthis method devised by Air Danshin Systems lifts\nthe house above the ground.\nAir Danshin claim that the technique it is not\nonly effective, but a third cheaper than many\nother earthquake-proofing systems and requires\nlittle maintenance. A set of powerful compressors is installed around the home and, when an\nearthquake hits, a vast amount of compressed\nair is released underneath the home, lifting the\nstructure. The response time is within one sec-ond, and structures can levitate up to 3cm using\nthis method.\nWhen the house is lifted, indoor valves control\nthe flow of air under the house, keeping the structure stable. Following the earthquake\u2019s end, the\nhouse is then lowered onto a reinforced concrete\nfoundation for extra stability. The system is currently being implemented across Japan, and is\nlive in 88 sites thus far. The company was established in 2005 to sell this technology, originally\ninvented by Youichi Sakamoto.\nThe news comes as Japan nears its first year\nsince the Fukushima disaster, where a series of\nfailures at the nuclear power plant following an\nearthquake and tsunami caused devastation.\nThe company hopes to expand the system in\nlarger and more critical structures, though issues\ninvolving gas, electricity and water lines still need\nironing out.\nTo better promote the technology, the company\nhas created some videos in-house demonstrating model homes floating as well as the mechanisms being used on live people. By showcasing\nsuch safe and possible measures of dealing with\nan earthquake, the company potentially paves\nthe way to a future of floating houses and power\nplants, with the onslaught of earthquakes leaving the homes of thousands and critical systems\nintact.\nLift off for Japanese houses\nStem cells help stop biological clock\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention\nNot actual levitation method\nTime might not be running out, after all\nWant to write for Felix\nScience?\nSend us an email.\nscience.felix@ic.ac.uk\nby Alexander Karapetian\n\n"

From dealing with the budget\nto supporting the various departmental unions, the Union trustee\nBoard does everything. In my view it\nis essential that students are represented by tough people to make the\nUnion hear their voice. I am committed to strongly supporting decisions\nensuring\n\u2022 A fair split of the budget between under/postgraduates and\npostdoctorates\n\u2022 Greater activity of clubs and societies in cooperation with UK and\nworldwide charities to involve students in broader challenges!\n\u2022 Closer solidarity between students,\na stronger \u201cacademic welfare\u201d to\nsupport them in their hard times\nand increase student satisfaction!\nI believe that I not only have ideas\nand strong enough convictions to\nmake other members of the Board\nrespect my views, but also that I am\nopen-minded enough to consider\nother opinions and find the best\nagreement, as I did as a member\nof trustee boards before I joined\nImperial.\nAs a second year biologist, closely\ninvolved in many of Imperial\u2019s music\nand sports societies, I know students from all courses and all years,\nand discussing my university experience with them has made me realize what changes ought to be done.\nGiving ME a place among the student trustees assures you YOUR\npoints will be heard, because the\nreason I\u2019m campaigning is to reach\na position where I can make a\nchange for you!\nSo remember : vote for Cora!\nDaniel Stoddart\nD\no you want someone\nwho will always listen\nto you?
