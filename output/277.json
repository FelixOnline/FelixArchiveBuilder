    "content": "Page 2 FELIX 8th May, 1969\nCOMMENT\nThe Parliamentary Select Committee on student relations\nhas attracted a fair amount of national publicity recently.\nFew people seem to be in any doubt that the committee are\nenquiring into student protest and what can be done about it.\nThe events at Essex are well know and further comment\non them would probably incur the wrath of Mr. Speaker,\ndespite the obvious value to the country of press comment\non such a topical event Undaunted, the sub-committee\ndecided to visit LSE; at first they did not want to meet any\nof the 'militants', merely Union 'bureaucrats', but, under\npressure they met a delegation of a dozen from the Uniaf\nmeeting. Why, it will be asked, this reluctance to meet\n'protesters', the people they are supposed to be enquiring\nabout?\nTo many students today this fracas seems typical of the\nbasic paradox of our society. We can reach for the moon,\ncontrol complex nuclear reactions and extend our dominion\nover nature in a thousand and one ways, yet the world is\nnot far from the brink of total disaster. This state of affairs\ncomes not from lack of control over nature, or God's crea-tion, but rather our lack of control over our own creations,\nthe institutions man has set up. Thus parliament, originally\nthought of as the institution through which popular opinion\ncould control the government, increasingly looks like an\ninstitution through which the government tries to influence,\nand hence control, popular opinion.\nSeen in this light, the re luc ta nec of the committee to meet\nreal protesters no longer seems amusing but disquieting. Is\nthe committee really trying to find ways in which the government can control outbreaks of student violence, because the\ninstitutions they represent are unable to really do anything\nto cure the disease of which protest is a symptom. How\nwould the committee suggest that the contradictions of the\npresent system can be solved ? How can academic freedom\nbe reconciled with the \" demands of the economy\" or\nequality of opportunity be brought about in a society of\nunequal wealth?\nNow we hear this committee is to visit IC on May 14th, and the Rector was asked to provide a wide spread of opinion\nfrom staff, students and authorities. Now this is a distinctly\nmore encouraging idea but how tragic the failure to rise to\nthe occasion has been! Lord Penney and Rex Lowin, who\nwas asked to provide six student representatives, have fallen\ninto the error of \" trying to preserve the good name of\nImperial College\". They have both submitted uninspired\nlists of respectable staff, and students involved in various\nreformist activities, but not a hint of an unorthodox ' protestor ', staff or student. Unfortunately the committee will\nprobably learn little from these eminent Daily Telegraph\nreaders.\nIn passing, it might be noted that this same attitude is\nexercised towards FELIX. The ' good name preservers'\nwould prefer to empty this newspaper of opinion and lower\nit to the turgid level of a house journal. Whereas we intend\nto maintain FELIX as a paper where all views can be\nexpounded.\nPerhaps some day those in authority at IC will ask a few outsiders what the standing of IC really is. The National\nFront types can't distinguish one student from another and\nthose progressives who can regard such antics with the\nderision they deserve. No, come off it, Rex and Rector, let\nthat committee meet a' wide spread of opinion '; more than\nthe good name of IC is at stake.\nPublished by the Editor, Les Ebdon, on behalf of\nICU Publications Board at Imperial College, London,\nS.W.I(015892963).

Here we publish reports from three of the most interesting,\nby members of the I.C. delegation.\nUniversities and\nindustry\nAbout 250 students from\n23 countries attended a conference on ' The Relationships between Universities\nand Industry\", held in\nChurchill College, Cambridge, during the vac. The\nwhole thing had been conceived and organised by a group of undergraduates\nthere and paid for by various companies they ap-pro ached. The conference was split\ninto five sessions, each consisting of two lectures, a break into small groups to\ndiscuss the points raised and\nthen back into the lecture\nhall for questioning of the\nspeakers and further discus-sion. Some of the subjects\ndeal th with were ' Universities' aims', Industry's needs',\n'The years before and after\nbusiness school', 'Organisa-t ional careers' and ' An\neconomist's view '. The class\nof the lectures varied from\nexcellent to pretty poor, with\nthe best session being given\nby Prof. Casimir, Director of\nResearch and Development,\nPhilips N.V., Eindhoven, and\nProf. Leavitt of the Stanford\nBusiness School.\nThe widely varying back-grounds, nationalities and\npolitics of the students produced many interesting heated and entertaining arguments. To say that any conclusions were reached would\nbe a great fallacy, but perhaps some of the points\nbrought out were a general\ndislike and fear of industry\nby the student body and a feeling that industry should\nchange to accommodate universities and their graduates\nand not vice versa; a general\nplea for a break from the\nspecialised education to a more general one and the advice that it would be a good\nidea for all students and especially those doing science\nand technology to spend a year 'out' before going to\nuniversity.\nOn the social side, our stay\nwas most enjoyable, from the\nopening dinner with its impressive selection of guests\ntopped by Prince Philip\nthrough an international folk\nevening with Lilian entertaining on her recorder, to\nthe final discotheque and\nlate-night film. Perhaps the\nfact that the bar was open\nuntil 11.30 helped.\nIt was altogether a worthwhile experience giving an\ninsight into what went on in\nother universities in this\ncountry and abroad. Most of\nthis information was gleaned\nduring a few late-night sessions consuming imported\nduty-free liquor. It also supplied an opportunity to see\nCambridge at the expense of\nindustry. Our thanks go to\nthe organisers, Churchill College, and those companies\nwho paid for it.\nDermott Corr\nThe Red Base\ntheory\nAt the University of Manchester, on Saturday and Sunday,\nMarch 22nd and 23rd, the first delegate conference of the\nRevolutionary Socialist Student Federation took place,\nattended by two hundred delegates, including three from the\nI.C. Group. In a serious and co-operative atmosphere, with\na high-level of debate, the wide spectrum of left-wing militancy represented aired its views. Differences were never very\nfar below the surface, but these were frankly discussed, not\nhidden behind a fragile facade of complete unity. They were\nin the main differences of means, not ends. The maximum\ncommon ground was sought, but principles were not sacrificed\nto this end.\nAfter the election of a triumvirate to chair the meeting,\nan agenda and standing orders were adopted. The announcement that the record of the open Round House Conference\nof last November had disappeared along with the stenographer (whose dedicated note-taking no-one had ques-tio ned) was met with some derision and speculation as to\ntheir whereabouts. By 96 votes to 92, the press was excluded\nfrom the conference on the grounds that press distortion\nrendered the publicity useless.\nRegan Scott, on behalf of the National Co-Ordination\nCommittee, reported that a nation-wide organisation was\nnow functional with its own resources, and that the conference must decide on its future direction. Manchanda called\nfor evaluation, stressing that there can be no revolutionary\nmovement without clear objectives which RSSF lacked at\nthe moment. After a financial report and a defeated proposal\nManchester congress\nThe Manchester Congress ' Response to Crises' was held\nover the Easter Vac, to study the problems of poverty in\nthe world. A series of main plenary sessions were held,\nthough two of the most important speakers were unable to\nattend. Jesse Jackson, the American Civil Rights leader had\nhis passport impounded by the U.S. authorities, and Conor\nCruise O 'Brien was stuck in Biafra at the time.\nOf the other Speakers, Ronald Segal described ' The Histtorical Causes of the World Crisis '. Much on the lines of his\nbook, 'The Race War', he emphasised the way the developed\nsocieties of the non-European world were raped by the slave\ntraders and the colonial exploiters. The failure of the coloured races to fight back effectively gave the white man a general feeling of superiority which still intensively survives,\noften in the assumptions made of how the poor countries of\nthe world should deal with their internal problems.\nThe second main speaker, Dom Helder Camara, Archbishop of Recife Brazil, spoke on similar lines, especially\ncrit ising paternalistic attitudes. \"The root causes of disagreements between social classes in one country lies in the\nattitude of the rich, who feel that the problem can be solved\nby aid, generosity and the proper distribution of the crumbs\nthat fall from their tables \".\nA large number of secondary meetings took place with\nspeakers such as John Davy, whose articles on the study of\nhuman nature have recently appeared in the \" Observer',\nMichael Duane, the ex-headmaster of Risinghill Comprehensive School, and Merlyn Rees, minister with special responsibility for immigration.\nThe general level of contributions and discussions were\nhigh, and there was a great deal of agreement as to the root\ncauses of the problems considered. I found the event particularly enjoyable for the opportunity it provided to meet\nstudents from other places, who were concerned with the\nproblems, and to have enlightened discussions with people\nwho did not resort to entrenched standpoints.\nHowever, no detailed answers emerged\u2014perhaps it was\nfoolish to expect magic solutions to arise. ' The Revolution'\nwas urged, but to most this did not mean necessarily a violent\nrevolution. A quite substantial minority did, all the same,\ndecide to occupy the South African Airlines Office, conveniently placed opposite the conference hall. To most the\n' Personal Revolution' and ' Not compromising with the\nsystem' were the answer, By this was meant not living\nwithin the narrow horizons of personal affluence, but being\nwilling to help the poor, and to stand out against the wrongs\ncommitted by ones compatriots\u2014indeed being aware of them.\nTo realise that the reformist treating of symptoms will not\nwork, but widespread political awareness of the needs of\nothers, and the willingness of a majority of people to tackle\nthe problems are all that will bring real results.\nTo members of I.C. this congress could have considerable\nsignificance. Not only do we work within two miles of\nNotting Hill, considered by some as the worst Ghetto in\nBritain, where all the classic causes of poverty exist\u2014large\nscale political domination by the surrounding areas, combined with indifference; bad housing; racial problems and\nefforts at social aid generally under financed. We are also at\nthe forefront of the move to create the post-industrial society\n\u2014a fran g men ted society, where the successful will increasingly forget the unsuccessful. Perhaps through our work as\nScientists and Technologists, the better, more integrated world\ncan arise.\nPete Elphick\nthat a horse-shoe shaped conference was more conducive\nto discussion, the base reports were given, particular emphasis\nbeing given to the activities of the London RSSF and the\nLSE. Activity was by no means confined to London how-ever. The recent events at Essex were however unique, and.\nthough reported in an extremely amusing manner, still gave\na clear warning of the result of lack of direction and purpose\nAt Essex, a large but undeveloped ' left' had been de mobilised and de moral is ed by the ease with which its ' aims'\nhad been achieved ! ! A two-week occupation, a strike and\na boycott of lectures had brought the University\u2014and the\n' left'\u2014to a standstill. The Aberdeen delegate, on the other\nhand, stressed the need to separate those who were in earnest\nfrom the ' cowboy-socialists'. Self-education in every field\nwas the real crux.\nContinued on page 7\nJ "

    "content": "Page 6 FELIX 8th May, 1969\nFIGHTING THE SYSTEM\nDave Christopher gives his own personal views on teaching methods\nThere is much discussion at the moment about teaching\nmethods. All this is meaningless without a clear concept\nof the purpose of teaching; a concept both of the purpose\nthat should direct teaching and that which directs it in\npractice. From a liberal definition of education, present\nteaching falls far wide of the ideal. In fact education in this\ncountry follows clear cut lines and is highly efficient.\nA list of the active governors of this college reads like the\nBoard of Directors of some giant industrial complex. As\nsuch people are the loudest single voice in the ear of the\ngovernment, it is clear that they will be moulding the broad\nlines of policy upon which the college is run. Just as 19th century public schools arose to supply a need for colonial\nadministrators and the like, our present system of further\neducation supplies the people to keep the industry and commerce of monopoly capitalism running.\nImperial College's main role is to provide research workers and technically qualified administrators. The industrial\nsystem in which they must work is not a simple one of\nstriving for increased production for the benefit of all. The\nwestern industrial nations are in a crisis of overproduction.\nTheir economies are constructed in such a way that existing\nstores of wealth would quickly lose their value unless surplus production were absorbed in some harmless way.\nWe have an essential place in this scheme of things. It is\nscientists that absorb surplus production by the million;\nrocketing metal into outer space; writing programmes to\nimprove the efficiency of killing asians; inventing processes\nfor taking the foam out of washing powders; inventing processes for putting a more attractive foam back into washing\npowders . . . you know the pattern already\u2014the mass media\nare full of it. In addition to playing these games with the\nfruits of labour of the exploited and with the hope of the\nstarving, we help dupe the mass of the population into blindly accepting it all by our complicity; by laying the weight\nof the popular mystique of science behind it for its just if i cation.\nIt is hard to imagine anyone leaving school with such\nan aim in mind. Freshers are more likely to see science as\nthe means of man's development from necessity to control\nhis environment, or to wish to pursue a particular branch of\nscience for its own sake, in a pure search for knowledge.\nIt is the function of a university to replace such ideals\nwith alienation and cynicism and thus prepare the student\nfor his career.\nBy the time we have completed three or more years of\nweekly lectures, problem sheets, practicals, tutorials, etc., we\nwill have been subjected to a formidable conditioning pro-ces s. If we then enter industry and find that our hard-won\nknowledge is either largely out of date or else mostly irrelevant to our work, we might feel it had all been a waste\nof time. That would be to miss the point. Our methods of\nthought and work and our attitudes to our work are\nmoulded in these years. We are taught to investigate set,\nisolated topics with scientific rigor, while any grasp of a wider view is discouraged and stunted. Our courses largely\nconsist of little compartments which we must explore along\nthe lines of past examination questions. Teaching is reduced\nto an uncritical churning out and learning to a passive con-sump tion. The sheer volume of work and our limited\nenergy and interest stops us from really learning about our\nsubject, as opposed to merely learning to perform exercises\nin it or write essays about certain related topics. When we\nare given a task, be it a practical or a problem sheet, or a lecture to learn, no-one justifies its usefulness. We may question this ourselves, especially in our first year, but with\ntime we accept the work automatically.\nThe staff always know best\u2014we just follow along. By\nthe end of it all, we are capable of performing certain technical functions well, even of directing others to do them,\nbut have no idea, and no wish to have any idea, of what lies\nbehind it all\u2014we accept unquestioningly the authority of\nothers to direct us.\nWith such a mentality we will be capable of performing\npractically any allotted task without question, however\nridiculous or inhuman it may be. We will be a credit to any\nemployer.\nThis process does have disadvantages for the system.\nScience and technology are progressing at such a rate that\none's knowledge must be constantly developing. For this, a broad-based knowledge of science is required, as more and\nmore fields are related to one's own and thus used. That the\npowers-that-be tolerate this deficiency is a measure of their\nreliance upon the passive subjugation to authority which\nour education has instilled in us.\nNot all I.C. undergraduates will end up in industry or\nsome related bureaucracy. Some may take up teaching or\nlecturing. Here, encouraged by their own attitudes, the\nsystem and the pressures of their teaching load, they will\ncontinue the process in the minds of future generations.\nThis state of affairs is deeply entrenched. You may be\nsure that any changes in teaching methods at I.C. will not\nbreak the pattern.\nI.C. Rugby tour of Ireland\nThe IC tour team again\nmade an Easter pilgrimage\nto the Guinness country,\nostensibly to play three\ngames of Rugby. Following\nin the wake of an apparently rowdy (surely not?) Oxford University team, the\nwarmth of the welcome was\na little in doubt, especially\nafter the odd escapade by\ntwo ginger-headed brethren\non the ferry.\nThe boat arrived on Sunday at 7 a.m. in Dun Laoghaire; by 10 a.m. all were\nbreakfasted and asleep in\nMoran's Hotel and by 3\np.m. all (well, nearly all) were\nlined up ready for the kickoff against Monkstown.\nUnfortunately IC were a man short as Pine had been\ninjured the day before in another game but our hosts obligingly provided the extra\nman. Against a much bigger\nside IC went extraordinarily\nwell for the first half culminating in a gem of a try by\nKeith Devaney who flashed\nin untouched from 25 yards\nout. Unfortunately just before half-time Devaney was\nlaid out along with his Birmingham mate Charlie.\nYour correspondent was\nthen obliged to accompany\nthe injured to St. Vincent's For the latest books on :\nHistory\nLAMLEY'S Architecture A Languages\nM \u2022\nfor your \u2014\nQrama\nM \u2022 BOOKS\nAnthropology\nNatural History\nJTconomics\nVisit the\nLEY ART MATERIALS\nPAPER BACKS\nSTATIONERY\nHaldane Library14 Prince's Gardens,\n9\n*\nOpen : Mon.-FH. 10\u20147; s Wed. 10\u20145.30 1 EXHIBITION ROAD, S.W.7 Hospital (where all the\nrugby players go) where the\nnurses and nuns performed\nthe customary miracles.\nDevaney was detained \u2014\nsomething wrong with his\nhead \u2014 and Charlie emerged\nsporting a sling. In the mean-time, a gallant IC team went\ndown 11-6 despite 'help'\nfrom another Irish guest\nplayer.\nMonday was a day of rest\nspent mainly in taking\nwaters and passing the water\nin the next bar. On Tuesday\na gallant 14 stood trembling\nbefore the might of some\nvery mature-looking ' fresh-ers ' from University College.\nThe result was predictably\nunfavourable. The whole affair is best forgotten especially as our opponents disappeared rapidly after the\ngame leaving us to amuse\nourselves \u2014 not too difficult with Moffat and\nSmithies in the party !\nAfter paying an exorbitant\nhotel bill\u2014the proprietor\nwas ' at the dentist's' when\nwe complained, Wednesday\nwas spent in travelling to\nAthlone in the rural heart of\nthe Irish peat bogs.\nThe bus driver flogged his\nvehicle along at a frightening rate in complete contrast\nto all else in the Shamrock\nIsle. The reason became apparent when after an hour\nLC. break away\nthe bus stopped and all and\nsundry piled out and into\nthe nearest bar for 20 min-ute s. This is apparently part\nof the service! The rest of\nthe journey was uneventful\napart from being made to\nfeel like caged monkeys by\nsome curious junior Irishmen at the other end of the\nbus. The sight of Messrs.\nMoffat, Mowat, Smithies,\nBallard and all fast asleep\nwas apparently fascinating.\nArriving in Athlone, one\nand all were immediately\nstruck by the preponderance\nof bars\u2014well over 60 which\nlined the streets. It transpired that in the Summer\nmonths these hostelries extract \u00a32 million from the\nAmerican tourists. Apart\nfrom this Athlone appeared\nvery poor with little alternative income but with\nfriendly natives and a position straddling the Shannon.\nOur hotel, the Shamrock\nLodge Hotel, was excellent,\ncheap and noted for the fact\nthat Queen Salote of Tonga\nand every other important\nMonsigneur stayed there.\nThe game against Athlone\nRFC on Thursday was\nplayed in the evening on a sloping pitch in brilliant sun-shine.

    "content": "8th May, 1969 FELIX Page 5\nVive la France! by John Spenc\nWhatever you say about the French! However much you\ncackle at them for Trafalgar and Waterloo, whether or not\nyou argue traditional ineptitude on the basis of the Maginot\nLine or the Fourth Republic, and even if you attribute at\nbest French kissing to them, and at worst onions \u2014 you\nhave to give them at least one thing \u2014 their art.\nFor in visual art, at least, France has probably shaped\nthe course of Western culture more than any other European\ncountry. From Van Gogh to Picasso, with Degas, Gauguin,\nMatisse and Cezanne in between, the French instigated and\nsustained the Impressionist period and when, in 1902, a rapid succession of images under the collective title of \" Les\nVictimes de L 'Alcool\" enthralled a Paris audience, most of\nwhom were seeing their first film, the stage was set for the\ncinema's takeover of public entertainment. Not surprising\nthen, that that film \u2014 probably the first ever social documentary \u2014 had a certain Monsieur Zecca as director who,\nas a Frenchman, blazed a trail in 16 millimetres which the\narchdeacons of the art, Louis Feuillade, Rene Clair, Louis\nBunuel and Jean Renoir so magnificently exploited half a century ago.\nMillions of words have been written on the effect early\nFrench cinema had on French (and western) painting\u2014moving images on a screen having been used to explain why, in\nturn, Picasso went all \" bitty,\" Toulouse-Lautrec all \" sexy,\"\nMagritte and Dali all \" eerie\" and Jackson Pollock all\n\" screwy,\" and it is a point, that, with the cinema and\nCartier-Bresson's camera reflecting realism into the public's eye, the painter simply had to find something else. But\nmuch is speculation and many theories are spurious \u2014 what\nis not in doubt is that nowhere is the development and\ntransformation in visual art seen better than in France and\nnowhere is French cinema, from the early silents of Feuillade to the noisy riot films of young Phillippe Garrel, better\nrepresented than in the Cinematheque Francaise \u2014 and that\nis the subject of this article.\nThe Cinematheque is a film archive and is to cinema what\nthe Natural History museum is to Paleontology. It is not\nthe oldest one \u2014 our own Natural Film archive dates before\nit but it has easily the largest and most varied selection of\nfilms of any such institution. It's oldest piece is an epoch\nmaking bit of celluloid from 1896 and, collecting con-tin u ou sly, it is bang up to date with the new, new, new wave,\nmany of which make Godard look like Cecil B. De Mille.\n\"The cinema the que is a school. From this school have\ncome the best directors of our time,\" said Jean Renior, and\nLuc-Godard likened the place to a\" permanent film \". Both\nthese comments are very apt. Night after night apparently,\nyou find at the place all the great French directors you\nwould expect\u2014projections can last ten hours and more\nwith no breaks except to allow the audience to assimilate\nthe impressions of the previous film. Yet the physical exhaustion could not have surmounted the essence of the\ntraining since early patrons like Chaplin, Lang, Losey,\nDreyer, Orson Welles, Truffaut, Marlene Dietrich, Simone\nSignoret and Jeanne Moreau have all, I think you'll agree,\nturned out pretty well.\nSo where lies the appeal of the place \u2014 its not as smart\nas our National Film theatre, not as comfortable as the\nEmpire, screen probably a third of the size of Cinerama,\nbut it goes on and on, and in a sense, perpetuates itself by\nkeeping French directors in the forefront of the \" nouvelle\nvague\" in addition to contributing some refreshing new\nterms such as \" cinema ve rite\" or \" cinema d 'hauteur \" to\nfilm jargon which under Hollywood got no further than\n\" so bbi es,\"\" weepies,\" \" cliff-hangers \" and \" horse-operas.\"\nMy guess is that it is the policy of its director \u2014 Henry\nLanglois \u2014 which gives the Cinematheque its unique qu ali ties. For thirty years Langlois has been an omnivorous collector of everything, disregarding contemporary critical opinion since often only age can bring out the rare qualities of a piece of art. Langlois endears himself to successive generations of young Parisian intellectuals by selecting his material fairly with no artistic or intellectual prejudices. He is a perceptive critic of the medium and sees Warhol, Reynaud,\nJean Vigo and Claude Lelouche as a great panorama of art,\na vision he has sought to impart to his audiences.\nHis film programmes are renowned and anyone who sees\nhis, presentations at the National film theatre in May will\nsee how the careful juxtaposition of one film with another\nwill evoke from each its own very special qualities. He is in\neffect a showman.\nAs a proud citizen of this \" nation of shopkeepers\" it\nsaddens me that in Britain we have nothing to rival the\nCinematheque Francaise; the National Film Theatre does\nwell without actually maintaining a stock of films, but it is\na sorry reflection on the British industry that almost everything you see at the NFT needs subtitles, earphones or an\nAmerican accent. The individual efforts of British directors\nhave been remarkable \u2014 especially when endowed with\nAmerican money \u2014 but there is as yet no true national\nachievement in \" technique,\" and even that's a French word.\nIt seems to me that unless someone somewhere begins to\ncollect all that is great about the British directed films, and\nsome not so great, young film-makers in this country will be\nforced to look French-wards for any stimulation to evolve\nnew colours (Lelouche), new editing (Godard), new structure (Rivette) and new music (Previn). I see a time when\nthe subtitles will disappear and if you can't roll your \" r's\" you'll be OUT on to the street.\nRECORD REVIEWS\nFELIX wishes to apologise for any in convenience caused to our film reviewer by the appearance of the word \"geno us iconoclasts\" in the article\n\"Romance and Revolt\" in the last issue of FELIX.\nElektra EKS 74033\u2014\nJudy Collins: Who\nknows where the time\ngoes?\nFriends in the U.S. tell me\nthat July Collins' songs are\nsweeping the land. DJs devote three-hour programmes\nto them; on the strength of\nthis album, it is easy to understand this. Nearly all the\nnine tracks are memorable;\nthere are two Leonard\nCohen songs, Dylan's\" Poor\nImmigrant\" and the Incredibles' \" First boy I loved \"\nfeatured, and one penned by\nJudy herself. \" My Father \"'\ndemonstrates the emergence\nof a new talent in song writ ing. Judy's sensitive treatment of the songs charges\nthe lyrics with a new power;\ninstrumentally the album is\ncharacterised by a tendency\ntowards C&W sounds, a trend which is growing at the\nmoment. C&W normally\nleaves me cold, but I found\nthe combination of contemporary songs and country-influenced instrumentals very\nattractive.\nIncidentally, Steve Stills,\nlate of Buffalo Springfield,\nplays guitar on all but one\ntrack.\nIt would be pointless to\nselect any particular track\nfor praise\u2014the whole album\nis superb.\nPhemius.\nSpooky Two \u2014 Spooky\nTooth\u2014Island 1LPS9098. The latest LP from\nSpooky Tooth contains eight\nlong heavily stylised but still\nindividualistic tracks. Most\nof these are heavy and full,\ncommonly termed a\" good\nsound.\" After three or four\nhearings the complete record is very likeable indeed\nand it is difficult to pick out\nany of the tracks for separate comment but perhaps\nthe best is \" That was only\nYesterday,\" a plaintive but\nfast number with an easily\nrecognisable melody.\nAmong the other songs\nthere are \" I 've got enough\nHeartache \" and \" Hangman\nhang my shell on a tree,\"\nboth sad but not really\nslower than the other tracks.\nThere is also \" Better by\nyou, Better than me\" and\nnearly ten minutes of \" Evil\nWoman \" both with admirable guitar work.\nMy only criticisms are the\nlack of variation in the\nmusic and the rather poorly\ndesigned sleeve. All the same\nthis is an excellent buy for\nall devotees to current mainstream pop.\npackage from a new group,\nLeviathan. The first record\nis conventional repetitive\npop, with better than average instrumentality, and the\nsecond consists of \" The War\nMachine\" and \" Time,\"\nboth of which could have\nbeen better if their themes\nwere not so overworked.\nFour Faces of Leviathan \u2014 Elektra \u2014\nEKSN 45052/57.\nThis is a double single\nThreshold of a Dream\n\u2014 Moody Blues \u2014\nDeram.\nThis much-heralded LP\nfollows the basic format of\ntheir previous \" Lost Chord,\"\nwith 10 songs and 2 poems.\nThe music, as one has come\nto expect from the Moody\nBlues, is excellent but in\nseveral songs the words are\nweaker than one would ex-pec t.I thought the best\ntracks were \" Never comes\nthe day,\" also released as a single, and \"Have you\nheard ?\", which contains\nan interesting instrumental\npiece, \" The Voyage.\"\nThe cover contains some\necstatic blurb from David\nSymonds and Lionel Bart, all\nof which can be safely ig-no red; the Moody Blues\nplay good music and\nshouldn't take themselves\ntoo seriously, lest they go th<.\nway of most pop groups.\n\u2022 Ml Judy Collins\n\n"

    "content": "Page 4 FELIX 8th May, 1969\nTEACHING AND LEARNING Following the Teaching and\nLearning Methods Conference,\nthree students give their views on\nwhat can and should be done.\nAction to be taken\nby Brian Hains\nThere has been considerable discussion over the past year\nor so about the purpose and structure of our degrees, and\nalso about their means of assessment. Many proposals have\nbeen brought forward for reform, but before trying to press\non with reform, however, we must first of all establish the\nneed for reform. Though this need may be self-evident to\nthose working in academic affairs, I have the impression that\nrelatively few of the total number of students are really interested in trying to change the existing system. Many students have accepted the examination as a fact of life and\nhave probably never thought of the purpose of the exam in a tion, and even less as to whether the examination achieved\nthis purpose.\nThis, then, must be the first objective. Students involved\nin academic affairs must not hide their light under a bushel.\nEach and every student of this college must be encouraged\nto think in depth about what he is doing and why he is\ndoing it.\nThe second objective is the staff themselves. The simplest\nway to involve large numbers of staff in this discussion is\nthrough the tutorials. Instead of being solely concerned with\n\" sheet 2 \u2014 problem 3,\" tutorials could be seen as a ready\nmade means by which four or five students can discuss the\npurpose of their education with a member of staff. Informal\nmeetings between staff and student are also very valuable\nand should be held on a regular basis in each department,\nsimilar to those held in Electrical Engineering.\nIt is important to realise that there are quite a number of\nprogressive staff, and while they must be given all our\nencouragement, none the less the initiative for reform must\ncome from the students. Otherwise the progressives will get\nnowhere, conservative staff will claim that everything in the\ngarden is lovely and that things should stay as they are \u2022\u2014\nwitness the lack of student objection.\nThe staff-student committees provide a valuable forum\nfor student dissension to be resolved. However, their terms\nof reference are rather ill-defined, as also is their power.\nI should like to see these become a vital ancillary to the\nstaff meeting and to have a more precise function to fulfill.\nAt present they are mostly concerned with minor administrative details such as coffee machines, availability of problem sheets and the size of a lecturer's writing. If these committees are not give a more imaginative role to play. I fear\nthat they will degenerate into a mere \" grouse and moan \"\nsession.\nThe diversity of student opinion is probably comparable\nto the number of days in the year. Clearly, then, there should\nbe some way for the student body to present the staff with a coherent policy. To achieve this I would suggest meetings\nsimilar to those I have begun in physics, namely a meeting\nfor year reps, student members of the staff-student committee and anyone else who is sufficiently interested to come\nalong. It is often useful in studying one's own department\nto know what goes on in other departments. I would, there-fore, advocate IC year rep meetings whose purpose would\nbe the free exchange of information between departments.\nThey could also, possibly, make recommendations to the\nRector's Education and Technology Committee.\nAlthough any fundamental changes must be approved by\ninnumerable committees in the University of London, I feel\nit is true to say that if a department really believes that a change is necessary, then this change will be granted. It is\nup to us to convince the staff body of the need for this\nchange.\nPurpose of Education by Piers Corbyn\nMan is moulded by his social environment \u2014 this is no\nless true for the students at IC who, being influenced by two\ncontrasting and conflicting claims on their time, lead dual\nlives, the conflicting influences being:\n(1) the course of study . . . work\n(2) the rest . . . influence inside and outside 1C which\nare not part of the degree course.\nThe moulding effect of the degree course is dictated by\nwhat is in it and the way it is taught. What is taught, is\nlargely decided by the needs of industry which are in turn\ncontrolled by the profit-motive, rather than by human needs.\nThe two are syn on omo us as was shown by Les Ebdon\nwhen discussing research in last FELIX.\nStudents in IC may be considered to have their existence\njustified on three accounts:\n(1) training for industry\n(2) Indulging in the ' disinterested pursuit of knowledge '\n(3) Being educated as responsible members of society\nand the world who have a good grasp of the way the\nworld works.\nTeaching is influenced in various directions by each of\nthese justifications. In IC, training for industry is by far the\nmost influential factor and any education to be responsible\nmembers of society is negligible. In RCS, the 'disinterested\npursuit of knowledge' is taken more seriously than else-where.\nAs far as training for industry is concerned, IC functions\nmainly to produce experts but we know, as Mr. Carpenter\npointed out at the conference, recruiters from industry look\nfor abilities such as those of applying ideas, recognising the\nsignificant and exercising judgement, rather than for people\nwho have assimilated a lot of facts. Most of the courses as\nthey are taught now suppress most of these abilities, at\nleast in the first two years. Promotion of these abilities\nnecessitates the complete re-structuring of the degree courses.\nObviously the actual re-structuring depends a great deal on\nthe department, but broadly speaking ' task-work ' should be\nthe centre of courses \u2014 to teach students how to formulate\nproblems. Lectures would then have a new lower status,\nbeing more like demonstrations and question-posing meet-in gs. The work entailed both for the students and staff\nwould be more difficult in initial stages but would pay\ngreater dividends in the long run. The re-structuring of\ncourses will not be easy and necessitates a lot of work in the\nBoard of Studies, Depts., and staff-student committees.\n\" I don't want to change the world, I want to be an\nengineer \" someone once said. This attitude is symptomatic\nof IC's failure to demonstrate the relationships between\nscience and society. Engineering \u2014 applied science \u2014 has\nchanged the world; ' science is social' said the \" New\nScientist \" and the BSSRS. Science is to do with scientists \u2014\nand vice versa \u2014 as was stated by Dr. Topping. The problem before us is how is ' social responsibility ' taught ? Social\nresponsibility is encouraged by not giving students time\nto study how the world works, as Gerald Leach said in the\nObserver (April 27). Scientists' education is usually lamentably bad at helping them see the broad significance of their\nwork.\nSocial responsibility is concerned with attitudes and it is\nprobably fair to say that people's attitudes are moulded by\nthe people they meet or work with. For this reason a specialised institution like IC tends to foster social irresponsibility\nthrough its uniformity of mind and corresponding lack of\nappreciation of ' other minds' and feebleness of criticism.\nThis brings us to ' the rest' \u2014 moulding influences which\nare not part of the degree course. The presence of arts students in IC would improve the situation \u2014 as should the\ncoming of the Architectural Association and as will the USK.\nIt might be possible in the future to have a limited number\nof courses common with the nearby colleges but if this does\nhappen we should not assume that joining the colleges under\nthe same administration would be a good thing, because IC\nis so industry-orientated that a common source of money\nwould be detrimental to the nature of the work done in\nthose colleges.\nIn closing let us say that a great deal needs to be done in\nIC and can be done if we all take the initiative and accept\nradical changes \u2014 perhaps extending to a4 year course to\ncope with what should be done.\nMethods of assessment by John MacAdam\nThe \" Teaching and Learning Methods \" conference held\nat IC at the end of last term drew attention to certain aspects\nof the teaching here that have been bothering at least some\nstaff and students for some while. To these people there\nappears to be something fundamentally wrong with the\nteaching here \u2014 something that cannot be corrected simply\nby a change in lecturing style or the use of audio-visual\ngadgets. The trouble lies not so much in the way the courses\nare taught, but to what end they are taught. The aim of a course naturally determines its content and also the way in\nwhich the student is assessed, since the assessment should\nmeasure the degree to which the student has fulfilled that\naim. As a corollary, the true aim of a course, whether\nspecifically stated as such or not, can be determined by\nexamining the content of the course and, more precisely, the\nmethods of assessment.\nThe predominant form of assessment throughout IC at\nthe moment is the written exam. The most important of\nthese exams, and so the major part of the assessment, generally comes at the end of the course. This indicates that the\naim of the course is to develop in the student some faculty or\nfaculties and the extent to which this has been done for the\nparticular student is estimated at the end of the course.\nWhat is the most important faculty looked for in these\nexams ? One point raised by Prof. Elton of Surrey University was that, on average, over 50% of a Finals exam in a scientific subject tests pure memory only. Furthermore, the\nremainder of the exam tends to test skills that are heavily\ndependent on memory; for instance, solving problems of the\ntypes the student has previously been shown how to ap-p roach. The time-limit on these exams also exaggerates this\nmemory dependance \u2014 there is just not enough time for a student to complete a question by working from basic principles. In general, it appears that the aim of teaching a course at IC is mainly that of getting the student to commit\nthat course to memory as best he can.\nSuch issues were raised at the teaching methods con-ference. Dr. Topping, Vice-Chancellor of Brunei, pointed out\nthat more general than specialist scientists are in fact required by industry in the ratio 3 : 2. He went on to\ncriticise present courses in which \" the facts concealed the\nprinciples\" and urged that the education of scientists and\ntechnologists should \" encourage flexibility \" and give them\n\" an appreciation of their role in society.\" Prof. Elton dealt\nwith the assessment side from the same point of view. He\nrecommended that rather than having one type of assessment\ntesting one skill, many different types should be used to\ntest the student's ability over a wider field. One example\nwould be the student's ability to work with others, rather\nthan competing against them as occurs with the traditional\nexam system. The result of such an ' all-round ' assessment,\nwhich has already been tried at Surrey, would be a profile\nof the student's particular skills, rather than a grade of\ndegree.\nIf such a teaching methods conference is to be of any use,\nsome positive action must come of it. Firstly the views of\nall staff and students on the issues of (i) the aim of the\nteaching at IC; (ii) the content of the courses here and (iii)\nthe methods of assessments best employed, must be collected.\nA committee must be set up, one would hope by JURGO's initiative, to organise, co-ordinate and analyse a wide ranging\nquestionnaire. This committee should be made up of both\nstaff and student representatives, the latter preferably elected by, and responsible to, ICU. It should be inter depart mental, for the issues to be dealt with are basic to the teaching throughout the whole of IC. The committee will also\nprovide a forum for the exchange of ideas between departments (in the past discussions and changes in course content\nand assessment in one department have often not even been\nheard of in others). When the views of all concerned have\nbeen collected and analysed, there must be machinery made\navailable to begin to put any changes indicated into effect.\nThis machinery could well be based on the staff-student\ncommittee mentioned above (it would be simpler if there\nwas student representation on the Board of Studies). Whatever the case, authority must be given so that all changes\nconsidered necessary can be put into effect in all depart-ment s. "

Discipline impasse\nCrisis looms Today, assuming there hsu,\nbeen no settlement of the\nASTMS University technician\npay claim, the Imperial College Branch of the union will\nbe in the last day of a three\nday official strike designed to\nsupport their demands for a10 per cent increase.

'Courts'\nA structure of discipline\n'courts' has been agr,e ed culminating in an Appeals com-mitte e. Four bodies have the\nright to give summary punish-ment s, Hall committees (who\nwill take over the Warden's responsibility for punish-ment), Union, Departments\n(who will be allowed to exclude people from lectures or\nlabs and levy fees for breakages but not expel students)\nand the Senior Warden.\nEither the accused of these\nbodies (who then become the\naccusers) can take offences\nto a discipline Committee\nconsisting of three authorities\nand three students with a Dean as chairman; the President will as a result of negotiations have a say with the\nRector in the appointment of\nthis chairman. The Appeal\ncommittee, the pinnacle of\nthe tier system will compromise two students, one of\nwhom will usually be the\nPresident, and two author i ties, usually including the\npro-Rector, a governor will\nbe chairman.\nThe first main concession\nwon by Union negotiators\nhas been the agreement to\ndrop the nebulous charge of\n'bringing the good name of\nthe college into disrepute'.\nHowever the central issue of\ndouble punishment remains\nunresolved. The college seem\nto insist on the right to punish\npeople who have previously\nbeen tried by the courts of\nland. This issue has already\ncaused one storm at an I.C. union meeting when a motion\nwas passed overwhelmingly\nrefusing to accept double\npunishment under any circumstances and mandating\nthe Governors to this effect\nby the end of the session. I.C. students were hoping that\nthrough JURGO the college\nwould, by negotiation, agree\nto drop their support for\ndouble punishment. This is\nthe stage that has been\nreached.\nA week ago when the subject was raised at the subcommittee no progress was\nmade. The three authorities'\nreps, according to reports,\nwere not prepared to abandon the principle of double\npunishment but tried to negotiate procedures to enforce\nit. They suggested two trials,\nthe first to decide whether to\nproceed with double discipline. Reports suggest that\nthe chairman of the committee Dr. Ware was a strong\nopponent of the union representatives, and attempted to\nmove the discussion off the\nmain topics onto legal arguments. President Rex Lowin\nbelieves that when the\nstrength of Union opposition\nto double punishment is\nknown, the Governor's representatives may be more\namenable to negotiation.\nNext move\nUnion officials are divided\nas to what the next move\nfrom the Rector's side will\nbe. Some feel that an attempt\nwill be made to split 'mode r ate' and 'militant' opinion, by\nan attempt to push a compromise through. There seems at\nthis stage little likelihood of\nsuccess for such a move as\nI. C.su dents are united on\nwhat is basically a nonpolitical issue. Other officials\nsuggest that the Rector might\nstep in to prevent the present\nimpasse developing into the\nkind of crisis that has led to\n'sit-ins' at other colleges. To\nmany council members how-ever, the negotiations involve,\nbesides the issue of justice,\nthe whole future of JURGO.\nIf the talks fail to eliminate\nthe possibility of double discipline they feel JURGO will\nhave proved to have been\nworse than useless.\n\u2022 Spike Bantin will be\nwriting an article opposing\ndouble punishment in the\nnext issue of FELIX. April 29th s Picket\ncould \"to ensure the success\nof Open Day\". The long\nmotion, put toward by the\nAUT committee, reorganized\nthe vital role which technicians play in the successful\nteaching of Science and Technology and, believing that\nthey were under - valued,\nwished them success in then-pay fight. Nevertheless the\nremainder of the motion\nstated that the IC AUT\nbelieved the \"good name of\nthe college and the best\ninterests of staff are in se per able\" and so AUT members\nshould ensure the success of\nOpen Day.\nThis is not in accord with\nthe official AUT line, but Dr.\nNewey, secretary of IC AUT,\nsaid it was up to individual\nmembers to place their own\ninterpretation on the motion.\nA member interviewed after\nthe meeting was uncertain\nthat a lot of staff would\nactually follow the AUT line.\nArthur Sier, branch chairman\nof ASTMS, said he couldn't understand how they (the\nlecturers) could support the\nAUT line on one day and not\non the other 3 days.\nNice footnote from the dis-put e. When the college computer came to deduct a day's pay from the technicians after\nthe April 29 stoppage, it\nmerely took off a seventh of\nthe weekly rate since it works\non a7 day week. ASTMS\nwouldn't stand for this as\naccepting a one seventh deduction would imply accepting a7 day week with obvious comebacks on overtime\nand holidays. Accordingly,\nthe college have had to spend\nmoney on converting the\ncomputer to a5 day week.\nGuilds failure rate shock\nThe interim report of the\nWorking Party on Student\nFailures produces figures\nwhich show that the failure\nrate of C and G students is\nway above that for other constituent Colleges. Taking an\naverage over the past five\nyears, the percentage failures\nin C and G in the first and\nsecond years are 12 per cent\nand 13 per cent respectively;\nthe equivalent figures for\nR.C.S. are 9 per cent and 6\nper cent. Since the Party feels\nthat although 1st year failures\nmay be due partly to academic reasons, subsequent failures\nshould be due mainly to non-academic factors, and should\ntherefore \"be smaller in pro-portion\", it has centred its\nattention on C and G depart-ment s. The report starts by suggesting that since Engineering\ncourses are wider in scope,\nthe value of School subjects\nas preparation is necessarily\nless than for Science subjects.\nThe report goes on to state\nthat \"the insistence upon\nrelevance to industry poses\nfresh intellectual problems,\nand the range of knowledge\nrequired may be such that\nthe relationship of parts to\nthe whole is hard to grasp.\"\nTests\nThe Working Party sees no\ngrounds for suggesting a change in the present standard of examinations in engineering subjects, and it finds\nno evidence to suggest that a certain proportion of students\nare doomed to automatic\nfailure (sic). It proposes that\nthe present system could be\nimproved by providing a series of tests throughout the\nyear, to provide preparation\nfor examinations; that examinations should be adjusted\nin time \"so as not to, provide\nundue strain on candidates\",\nand that some idea of marks\nobtained in examinations\nshould be given to students.\nGreat emphasis is placed\nin the report on the need to\nbalance the quantity of work\nbetween the 1st and 2nd years. Since a number of\nstudents have covered at least\na small proportion of their\nfirst year work at school, they\nmay be encouraged to \"place\ntoo great an emphasis on\nextra-curricular activities\". In\none department 43 per cent\nof the third year students felt\nthat the 2nd year course was\noverloaded. The present procedure of providing a Common Course in the 1st year\nalso comes under fire, since\nit tends to breed lack of\ninterest in the main subject.\nThe diversion of interest in\nthe first year also tends to\ncause some overloading in\nthe 2nd year.\nPass degree\nAfter discussing the need\nfor improvement in the\ntutorial arrangements in the\nsecond year, the report concludes that what it terms\n\"rescue operations\" should\nbe introduced as a solution to\na number of problems. It\nquotes the 70 per cent pass\nrate obtained in 1st year re-sits elsewhere as good reason\nfor introducing the same\nprocedure in C and G and\nrecommends the introduction\nif Pass Degree c sur ses in the\n3rd year to cater for marginal\nfailures, who would otherwise\nbe forced to re-sit 2nd year\nexaminations 12 months later\nto get back onto the third\nyear course. The report\nquotes figures from R.C.S. departments to support this\nmove: in Physics the outright\nfailure rate of 1.2 per cent in\n1968 would have been 16.1\nper cent if it had not been for\nthe pass degree course, which\n14.9 per cent opted to take.\nThe Working Party stresses\nthat their report is only in-teri m, and suggests that long\nterm investigations over 2 or\n3 years are needed to produce\na Final Report on the subject of student failures. Some\nstudents have been shocked\nby the report's complacent\nattitude to the exam system\nin the College.\n\n"

Also, the'\nopinions represented in these\nletters are not necessarily the\nopinions of Felix. .\nStudent house shock\nRelevance of Essex\nDear Sir,\nWith reference to the recent demonstrations at the\nUniversity of Essex during\nthe visit of the Select Committee C on student relations,\nI feel that the national press\nhas, deliberately or other-wise, completely ignored or\nmisrepresented the point that\nwas being made by the de-mon strat or s. With the pending visit of\nthe same Select Committee\nto IC I should like to take\nthe opportunity of stressing\nthe point of the demon strat ors, as I feel it is very relevant for us.\nThe Commons Select Committee on Education has been\nand will continue to, travel\nthe Universities collecting,\nprimarily, information on\nstudent unrest. It does, there-fore, seem ludicrous to me\nthat the Select Committee is\nnot meeting the one group of\nsud ents who are most able to\ngive them the relevant information\u2014that is, the left-wing\nWhose\nopinion ?\nDear Sir,\nI 've just watched Christopher Parker make Imperial\nCollege look ridiculous by\nassociating its name with the\nreactionary and stupid views\nhe put forward on the BBC's' Man Alive'. This surely\nbrings up the whole question\nof who is to represent IC in\nany matter of external com-muni cations. Perhaps the\nPresident would care to explain his choice (if it was his\nchoice) of Mr. Parker at the\nnext Union meeting. This\nwould seem to me exceptionally relevant at the present\ntime in the light of the coming visit of the Government's Select Committee of Student\nAffairs, and their meeting a wide spectrum of College\nopinion. How wide? Who de-cide s? Whose opinion?\nYours sincerely,\nAlan Lafferty.\nstudent ' protesters'.\nThe fault for this lies both\nwith the select committee\nitself and with the authorities of the Universities con-cern ed. In certain cases, e.g. the London School of Economics the Select Committee\nhas asked to see the President\nof the Union, the Vice-President, the President of the\nAthletic Union, etc., but under pressure it agreed to meet\nelected Union delegates. In\nother cases, e.g. Imperial\nCollege, the Select Committe has asked the Principal to\nallow them to meet half a dozen students representing a fair cross-section of student\nopinion. Once again the same\nhandful of Union bureaucrats\nhave been selected. This does\nnot allow the student left a chance to explain itself neither is the Committee meeting\na fair cross-section of student opinion.\nIt must be pointed out that\nwritten evidence can be submitted by any student; this,\nhowever, is no substitute for\na personal confrontation\nwhere one can make relevant\nand instructive comments as\nthe Select Committee, I am\nsure, wishes.\nThe only way that it is\npossible for the select Committee to meet a broad spectrum of student opinion is by\na completely open question\nand answer session. If it is\nfelt that this would be unmanageable or an inadequate\nway for the Select Committee\nto ask its ' prepared' questions and it is felt best to\nresort to small personal interview sessions, then, in order\nfor the Select Committee to\nachieve the purpose for which\nit was constructed, surely it\nmust be allowed to meet\nmembers of the student left.\nOr else, as we saw at the University of Essex, the student\nleft will find it necessary to\ntake their views to the Standing Committee.\nYours faithfully,\nC.P. Thunhurst.\nOverseas Students\nCommittee\nDear Sir,\nImperial College has a higher proportion of overseas\nstudents than many other similar institutions. In this connection with the new and still evolving Overseas Student Committee should serve a useful purpose and should be welcomed. I also welcome its recent promotion, I gather, to\nbecome a sub-committee of the Union Welfare Committee,\nand its recent effort to ensure, through a new constitution,\nthat its member be elected from the general body of overseas\nstudents.\nOn the other hand I should like to suggest, while the\nmomentum of the Committee and its evolution is still gain-ing, that it broadens and looks further in its aim than the\npresent one of catering for the welfare of overseas students,\nand what it sounds like in the constitution, of pulling them,\nlike a separate species, into more active life in the college.\nIf we follow the apparent wish of the brains behind the\nnew constitution, that the committee be one elected and thus\nbe longing to overseas students, surely its aims should be that\nfurthering their interests (welfare being one of these), of\nbringing out their contributions to the life of the College\n(it is more often outsiders who ' encourage participation'\nto quote the original wording), and of promoting an international atmosphere among all students (rather than encourage British-overseas social contact).\nThese suggested changes are much more than a matter of\na difference in wordings. They are necessary in order that\nthe Committee can give a more genuine benefit to the\noverseas students well as to the whole student life. They\nare also necessary in order that the committee can attract\nsupport. Unless in the general meetings where its members\nare elected, there are sufficient controversial issues (or\nprobably unless there are sufficient entertainments of whatever kind, as at the Constituent College Union meetings),\nit seems unlikely that more than the quorum of 80 overseas\nstudents would attend, just to elect a committee that only\nlooks after their welfare and, following again the wordings\nof the Constitution, to assist them in their problems. The\nrecent general meeting attracted only 20 students.\nJohn Cheung\nCollar and tie rule\nDear Sir,\nA rule requiring jacket,\ncollar and tie to be worn in\nBeit Upper Refectory has\nrecently been enforced. No\nother refectory in College has\nthis rule; not even the South\nSide staff refectory.\nThe College seems to want\nconformity to an old-fashion-ed idea of respectability, a policy more appropriate to a finishing school than to a University.\nWhy have this rule ? The\nonly reason can be to keep\nstudents out, so that it becomes effectively the Beit\nstaff refectory. If so, this is\nanother reason why the rule\nshould be strongly opposed.\nYours sincerely,\nDr. B. Achwayshilaf, M.G. Green, G.P. Gopal, A. Mutalib, G. Thompson, D. Pearce, B. Penny, (PGs,\nPhysics).\nDear Sir,\nWould you like to be suddenly handed a bill for electricity which was supposed\nto be free ?\nResidents in Bernard Sunley House were told last term\nthat due to insufficient heating arrangements they would\nuse their own electric fires\nplugged into the \" free \" wall\nsockets.\nFive weeks later they were\ntold that they had no right to\nuse them and from then on\nthey would receive a bill for\nall electricity used. This term\nthey received a bill for the\nwhole term\u2014charged at the\n\u2022maximum rate of 3d. per\nunit.\nAlright, so they were only\npaying for what they used,\nbut are they ? Inquiries into\nhow the totals were arrived\nat are met with the sharp\ncomment that \" they've got to\npaid, no arguments\". The bill\nfor one single room came to\nover \u00a38! That is 9 units a day, seven days a week, yet\nthe person in question spends\nmore of his time out of the\nroom.\nThe residents have been\ntold that the house is running\ninto financial difficulties. It\nis obvious that they are paying for other people's mis-takes.\nSomebody has also thought\nout that the more of us there\nare, the more we pay; so\nwhen somebody returned to\nhis room last week he found\nanother bed and a wardrobe\ncrammed into it. Unluckily\nthere was no room at all for\na second writing desk\u2014so the\nnew resident has to do with-out.\nIt appears that this is the\nfirst of many ' enlargements '\nthat will be made, though details are, as usual, hard to\ncome by until everything has\nhappened.\nThe \" House Committee \"\nset up to safeguard our interests is taken no notice of\nat all. Everything they want\nis agreed to at meetings, yet\nnothing done after.\nWe keep being told the\nhouse is new, difficult to or-g anise, but do we hear any\ncomplaints from Linstead\nHall?\nYours,\nJohn Giles.\nDOUBLE\nPUNISHMENT\nWe have received a number of letters on the subject\nof double punishment but\nare unable to publish them\nbecause of lack of space.\nHowever we hope to publish\nletters on this topic in the\nnext FELIX. All letters for\npublication should be brief,\npreferably under 300 words.\nYou have enough\nto worry about. So we don't ask for bank charges.\nThe biggest cloud on the horizon\nfor a student (apart from\nexaminations) is money. A grant\nis difficult to live on.\nSo Lloyds Bank doesn't ask for\nbank charges on student\naccounts, provided\nthe account is\nalways in credit.\nWe can also give free advice\non how to manage your\nfinancial affairs.\nWhy not talk to the Manager\nof your nearest branch of\nLloyds Bank? He'd be delighted\nto see you.\nLloyds Bank\nhelps you to plan.\nNearest branch to the College: 67/69 Old Brompton Road, S.W.7. "

'ill\nPete Ruhemann.\nConvocation to hear\nRuhemann motion\nA motion to be proposed\nat London University Convocation on May 13th contains\na number of highly topical\npoints. Seconded by Pete\nRuhemann, chairman of IC\nSCC last year, it welcomes\nthe NUS-VC statement of\nOctober last year which, according to the motion, emphasises the importance of\nstudent participation on com-mitte es, and in disciplinary\nprocedures, staff-student discussion of courses and exams,\nand freedom of expression of\nunpopular opinions.\nA second part of the motion notes developments within the University in the spirit\nof the statement but expresses\ngrave concern at events which\nsuggest the principles of student participation are neither\nwelcomed nor put into pra c tice. The events the motion\nquotes are \" the continuing\nconfrontation at LSE\", the\npressures on certain students\nactive in the \" Save Woburn\nSquare\" campaign, and the\n\" racial discrimination \" affair in relation to the University Lodgings Bureau.\nApplicants shun\nStudent Houses\nIt appears that there will\nbe little difficulty in applicants to Student Houses being\ngiven places, as only about\n50 application have been received for up to 350 places if\nthe new Houses are opened\non time. Rejected applications\nfor Hall are passed on to the\nStudent Houses if the applicant wishes, so these will be\nused to fill up the remaining\nplaces.\nThere is some disagreement over the opening date\nof the new Houses. Due to\nthis uncertainty, it has been\ndecided that the 69 fresher\nresidents will be given prefer-en ce. Thirty five people have applied for the posts of Wardents for the new Houses, and\n12 have been selected for\nfurther interview with their\nwives or fiancee s. In Bernard Sunley House,\nthe rule that residence for\nmore than half a session\ncounts as a full year has been\nrelaxed this year, as many\nresidents have been living in\nfor just over the half ses-sion, and because of the considerable hardship already\nundergone by many of these\npeople.\nApplication forms for\nP. Gs. who want a place over\nthe Summer Vacation, mainly in the Student Houses, are\nnow available from the Halls\nof Residence office.\nConfirmed\nOn Thursday, May 15th( Ascension Day), a number\nof students from IC will be\nconfirmed at a service at St.\nAugustine's Church, Queen's Gate, at 6.15 p.m. There will\nbe a buffet supper afterwards.\nIC \"not happy\"\nFrom time to time various\nstudents have approached\ntheir academic representatives to express a desire for\nnon-technical studies to be\nincluded in their degree\ncourse. As a result, the academic representatives of the\nConstituent College Unions\ncirculated a questionnaire to\nassess the demand for such\ncourses, and therefore to decide whether there is a case\nfor action at College level.\nTheir report had been published this week.\nClearly, students are not\nhappy with the General Studies scheme available at pre-sent. General Studies compete with other activities\u2014\nincluding lunch. Some departments already offer nontechnical courses as part of\nthe degree course but practice varies between depart-ment s. RSC notably do not\noffer these courses whilst\nElectrical Engineering is particularly progressive in this\nrespect.\nIn the USA the advanced\ntechnical universities, Massachusetts Institute of Technology and California Institure of Technology in par-tic u dar, permit their students\nto include a considerable\nnumber of non-technical\nsubjects as part of their\ndegree. The questionnaire\nwas circulated among just\nover 2,000 students of which\nexactly 1,000 replied.\n4 per cent Opposition\nThe most impressive conclusion that can be drawn\nfrom the replies is that over\none third of those who replied would like non-tech ni cal studies to comprise more\nthan 20 per cent of the assessment for their degree. Only\n4 per cent were opposed to\nthe introduction of nontechnical studies irrespective\nof whether or not it was included as part of their degree. The most popular subject\nrequested, out of a number\nsuggested, was Economics.\nPsychology was second.\nStudents participating were\ninvited to add any comments\nand these were principally\neither endorsing the need for\nnon-technical subjects or expressing the opinion that it\nwas essential to make time\navailable for such studies.\nThe results indicate quite\nclearly that students are dissatisfied with over-special is a tion. Non-technical courses\nare not wanted as soft options\nbut as serious studies.\nUrgency\nIt is now a matter of urgency that facilities should be\nmade available to offer alternative subjects: ninety-six\nper cent of the present students who replied to the questionnaire want them. The report makes various suggestions for short-term solutions,\nincluding making courses in\nother colleges of the university available as part of the\ndegree courses here.\nPerhaps the final word\nshould be had by someone\nfrom Physics who commented on his questionnaire :\n\" I came to IC for the\nsimple reason that there\nwere no auxiliary courses\nof humanities, social sciences, etc. Had I wanted\nthem I would have gone\nelsewhere. The fact is that\nI am a narrow-minded\nscientist and wish to remain\nso.\"\nLodgings\nBureau\nthreat\nRumours are rampant that\nthe proposed West London\nbranch of the University of\nLondon Lodgings Bureau at\nImperial College will adopt\nthe same listing of landlords,\naccording to the skin pigment\nof tenants they will accept,\nand that direct action is being planned to prevent the\nnew Bureau opening. However it is likely, in view of official Council policy and pressure from overseas students\nthat the college authorities\nwill be asked to take action\nbefore any incidents can\noccur.\nJarvis hits trouble over\nStatus Quo letter\nLegal Action is being\nthreatened against Ian Jarvis,\nthe Carnival Co-or d in at or following comments made by\nhim about the pop group\nStatus Quo in a letter to\ntheir agency after the ill-fated\nAlbert Hall Concert. In this\nletter he expressed his disgust\nat the behaviour of the Status\nQuo during the concert.\nSolicitors for the group re-plied, demanding an unqualified apology and withdrawal\nand an offer of a reasonable\nsum to compensate the Status\nQuo within seven days or\naction would be taken. This\nwas not done, and the entire\nmatter is now in the hands\nof the College Solicitors.\nThe total loss on the concert has now been added up\nto \u00a31344 15s., which has been\npaid from collecting tin\nmoney, as reported previous-l ill ll ll iii Improved decor lightens bar atmosphere\nThe revamped Union Bar\nwas opened to its regulars at\nthe beginning of term. At a cost of approximately \u00a31300,\nalmost all of which was provided by various breweries,\nthe improved decor now allows Gus, the barman, to\nmove in lounge furniture on\na Sunday to create an atmosphere in which women do not,\nas in the past, feel out of\nplace.\nGus himself feels the new\ndecor is a vast improvement\nbut cannot comment on consumer reaction until the regulars return from their pre-exam hibernation. Initial reaction has, however, been\nfavourable; as one drinker\ncommented : \"the old atmosphere has been maintained\ndespite the improvements\".\nMuch of the improvement\nis to the woodwork, which\nhas been cleaned and varnish-ed. The bar counter itself has\nhad an extension to its width,\nwhich had brought about a marked decrease in the\namount of beer spilt over the\nedge. If, when the hordes re-turn, any beer does creep\nover the edge it will not meet\nwith the old wooden floor but\nwith a more resistant concrete verge.\nThe trade-mark of the old\nbar still remains, however;\ndespite having been cleaned\nand waxed the floor is rapidly\nreverting to its old beer-stained form. Gus hopes that\nthe planned re clean, and varnish with a different technique will, however, add the\nfinishing touch to the new\ncreation.\n\n"

Ala\nplayed a very tight match,\nmaking few un forced mistakes and allowing his opponent to win a mere 10 points.\nThe entire fate of the cup\ndepended on this last match.\nIt is extremely satisfying\nto see the material is ation of\nour aim and endeavours, for\nwhich all those involved are\nheartily congratulated.\nResults: (I.C. players first)\nJ.

F.C. tour party left\nLondon on Saturday March\n22nd and on the evening of\nthe same day received a very\ncordial welcome from the\nlandlady of a very exclusive\nLlandudno guest house in\nwhich we were to be the only\nguests for a week. The first\ntwo days were spent getting\nacc lim at is ed, but unfortunately, acc lim at is ation proved\nto be rather difficult on the\nSunday as Llandudno was\nfound to be in a \"dry\"\ncounty. However it was soon\nThe Red Base Theory\nContinued from page 2\nA long debate on the \"red-base theory\" followed. This\nis the building up of politically conscious groups in the\nUnversities, and increasing\npolitical awareness and militancy there with the aim of\ncarrying this to the working\nclass by example. This was\nsupported by the New-Left\nReview Group, the International Marxist Group and\nmany un aligned delegates.\nThe critics (mainly the International Socialists and the\nMaoists) condemned the\nstratagem as petit-bourgeois\nand isolationist, and as an\nattempt to substitute student\nfor workers' struggle. Much\nof the debate centred round\nthe events at LSE, and contributions from Nick Bateson\n(against) and Robin Blackburn (for) were received. All\nspeakers stressed the need\nto build a revolutionary\nmovement with strong theory,\nand the obvious problem\nwas fusion with the working\nclass. The termination of this\ndebate, bec aue s of the lack\nof time, gave rise to the only\ndisorder of the conference,\nsince it occurred immediately prior to Manchanda's con-tri but ion. The Maoists halted\nproceedings for about twenty\nminutes until a compromise\nwas reached (to continue the\ndebate the next day).\nThe Ulster (People's Democracy) representative took\ncomplete advantage of the\ndisorder to follow it by an\nimpassioned demagog uic speech, in which, to scattered applause (?) he attacked everyone, urging them to\nprove the pudding by an\nEaster weekend in Ireland.\nThe second day included\na talk, discussion and question time with four representatives of Ford workers;\nthe adoption of the 'red-base\ntheory' as official policy; the\nproposal of a series of policy\nand solidarity motions; and\nfinally the adoption of an\nofficial, RSSF manifesto, a condition of membership being acceptance of the general\nprinciples therein. This latter\nmay prove a thorn in the\nsides of several groups of\nRSSF members, since it precludes the existence of any\nparty at present capable of\nrevolutionary leadership. The\nconference closed with a rousing version of the ' Internationale ', and, just for once,\neverybody knew the words,\nif not the tune.\nJ.P. POYSER\nTEN PIN\nBOWLING CLUB\nSince the last report in\nFELIX, there has only been\none match, which was at the\nend of last term against Sussex University, down at Hove.\nSussex have a small club\nand so could only put out 3\nthree-man teams as opposed\nto the 5-man games which\nwe normally play. However,\nwhat they lack in numbers\nthey make up for in perform-ance. Our 2nds and 3rds were\na long-way outclassed but the\n1st team game turned out to\nbe a superbly close match\nwhich we were unfortunate\nto lose by only 7 pins out of\na total pin-fall of about 3000.\nThis was such a close match\nall the way that even the\nopposition said that the just\nresult should have been a draw. Top series scores of the\nday were D. Foster 519, and\nR. Owen 517.\nThe 720 series scored by\nDave Foster at the end of\nlast term which broke East\nActon's house record is almost certainly the British\nUniversities' record.\nStevenson Cup to R.C.S. R.C.S. have won the Stephenson Cup, the constituent\ncollege mens' hockey trophy. They secured overall victory\nby drawing 2-2 with Guilds on the last Sunday of the Easter\nterm, in what proved to be an even, exciting game.\nGuilds took the lead through Mudan early in the game, but\ngoals by Thacker and Andrews saw R.C.S. with a lead at\nhalf-time. The second half was a fluctuating affair with first\nR.C.S., then Guilds seeming to get on top, culminating in\nBates equal ising for Guilds a few minutes from the end.\nEarlier in the season R.C.S. has beaten Mines 2-1 with\ngoals scored by Roper and Vincent, and Guilds later lost\nto Mines by the same score.\nR.C.S. team:\u2014 Stevart; Smith; Anderson; Stewart, Roper\n(capt); Vincent; Hobbs; Thacker; Adams; Andrews; Bowler.\nrealised that a short bus ride\ntook us across the border into\nColwyn Bay, which was\n\"wet\".\nOn Tuesday, joined by the\nlast two members of the\nparty, we travelled to Saint\nAsaph to play the high school\nthere in what proved to be an\neasy match I.C. winning 6-3.\nQuite a few spectators\nwatched the game and the\nI.C. goalkeeper complained\nabout objects thrown from\nbehind the goal. These were\nfound to be lollipop sticks\nand not beer bottles, as first\nthought.\nThe evening was spent in\nRhyl, which, although it is\nsupposed to be the main holiday resort of this coast was\nrather deserted while we were\nthere.\nWednesday saw us faced\nwith our hardest game of the\ntour and with two casualties,\none player having a bad\nattack of 'flue and the other\nneeding a visit to the physiotherapist at the local hospital\nfor treatment. Both players\nturned out in the afternoon,\nhowever, and we managed to\nbeat John Bright G.S.43 in\na very closely fought game.\nThe opposition were strengthened by the inclusion of 3 or\n4 players of local league\nexperience and this was a good win for the I.C. team.\nThe next day I.C. moved\nalong the coast to Abergele to\nplay their third game in three\ndays. The pitch looked as if\nit had been freshly ploughed\nfor the game and at half-time\nwith the score 0-0 it seemed\nthat we might lose our 100\nper cent record. However in\nthe second half I.C. got on\ntop of the opposition and\neventually mastered the pitch\nto finish the game 4-1 win-ner s. The final evening was\nspent, as might be expected,\nvisiting some, or even most\nof the most refreshing places\nin Llandudno.\nThe players deserve congratulation on their fine\nrecord on tour. Although the\nopposition was not, in most\ncases, too strong, it was the\nfirst time that the players,\ntaken from the 1st XI to 4th XI had played together and\nthey gave quite a lot of effort\nand enthusiasm to play as a team.\nTour party: R.
