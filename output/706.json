    "content": "GOODBYE MOONEY! 2\nThe\nEighties\nStudent dies after meal\nAn Engineering student collapsed\nand died last Tuesday as a result of\nconsuming a Sherfield Refectory\nmeal. His name is being withheld\nuntil the College authorities have\ncontacted his relatives.\nFriends of the student told\nFEEL SICK that they had eaten\nwith him on Monday lunchtime\nin the Lower Sherfield Dining\nRoom. The deceased had eaten\nbaked mince beef roll, peas, and\nchips whilst his friends had eaten\npizza, peas and chips.\nOn his way to afternoon\nlectures, the student collapsed in\nthe Mchanical Engineering\nDepartment foyer, clutching his\nstomach. While the messenger\ncontacted the College Health\nCentre, the student's friends\nplaced pullovers under his head\nto make him comfortable.\nThe doctor from the Health\nCentre immediately telephoned\nfor an ambulance and the student\nwas taken to St Stephen's Hospital. While in intensive care\nhe experienced violent convulsions and passed away in\nthe early hours of Tuesday\nmorning.\nAt the postmortem held on\nWednesday afternoon, it was\nrevealed that death had been\ncaused by an excessive amount of\nforeign indigestible material\nbuilding up to the student's stomach. Professor Brown, the\npathologist who performed the\nautopsy told FEEL SICK that he\nfound 957 potato peel ers,251 can\nopeners, 152 fly buttons, 92\nhairpins, 61 cigarette butts, 57\ntoenails, 29 pairs of spectacles, 25\nsets of false teeth, 18 glass eyes,\n15 Max Bygraves cassettes, 14\ncolo s to my bags, 12 packets of\nsuppositories, 5 digital watches, 2\nrusty bicycle pedals and one\nsurgical support in the deceased\nstudent's stomach and colon. He\nadded that he would be\ncontacting the Guinness Book of\nRecords just as soon as he had\nwashed his hands.\nReaction to the death has been\nswift at the College. An undisclosed source in the\nS her field Kitchens told FEEL SICK that as soon as Mr Mooney heard about the death\nhe rushed into the refectory and\ntold the chef not to keep the\ngravy browning on the same shelf\nas the potato peel ers, can\nopeners, fly buttons, hairpins,\ncigarette butts, toenails, spectacles, false teeth, glass eyes,\nMax By graves cassettes, colo s to my bags, suppositories,\ndigital watches, rusty bicycle\npedals and surgical supports.\nFEEL SICK asked Mr Mooney\nabout the student's death. Mr Mooney said that it was probably\nsomething he ate. When\nFEEL SICK challenged this\nstatement, Mr Mooney said that\nhe was very sorry about the death\nas it gave College catering a bad\nreputation and that it really\n'screwed up' his chances of a CBE in the Birthday Honours\nList. He stressed that he had\ntaken steps to ensure that it\nwouldn't happen again. He\nadded that there had been a similar incident earlier in the\nweek but the student had not\ndied. He said that he would\napologise to the next of kin but as\nthe student had made such a 'life\nand death' issue about it he\nwould not give them a refund.\nFEEL SICK asked Captain\nLindley, Domestic Secretary,\nhow many students had died\nafter eating at IC. He answered\n53,744, but doubted if they had\ndied immediately after eating.\nJohn Passmore, ICU President, said that the affair was\nvery distressing, particularly as it\nhad happened now as it would\ninterfere with his UL U Presidential election campaign.\n'Nevertheless' he stressed, 'I will\nhelp the\u2014College hush up this\nmatter to the best of my a bil ties'. Reprintedfrom FEELSICK 1981\nHealth centre\nafter meal\nAn IC student, Abid Ali Dost, a Chemistry PG, received a cut lip\non Tuesday evening while eating a meal in the Southside Refectory.\nHe had been eating Pizza, rice\nand salad in the main Southside\nDining Room, when he cut the\ninside of his lip on a piece of glass\napproximately one centimetre\nlong. The glass came from his\nmeal, so he went back to the\nserving point with two friends.\nWhen he complained, he was told\nthat the bowl containing the\nsalad was chipped, and it was\nthought that the glass came from\nthere. Mr Dost was taken to the\nHealth Centre at 6.00pm for\nmedical attention.\nMr Dost told FELIX that he\nthought it strange that the\nSouthside staff should know of\nsuch a hazardous bowl, as they\ncould identify it immediately, but\nstill serve from it. He added that\nthe way the matter had been dealt\nwith in Southside made it appear\nthat such events were an\neveryday occur ance. On returning to Southside\nlater, the offending bowl was still\nbeing used to serve salads from\nand it was not removed until a further complaint was made.\nWhen FELIX telephoned Mr Mooney, he said that he knew\nnothing about the affair, as it had\nnot been reported to him. When\nhe was asked about the chipped\nsalad bowl, he relied that it was\nonly hearsay, and he would not\ncomment on it.\nJunk food\nLAST TUESDAY afternoon a computing first year undergraduate found a piece of metal in\nhis Sherfied Refectory meal.\nHe had been eating quiche,\nchips and sweet corn, when he\ndiscovered a chunk of metal in\nhis mouth. His friend, who was\nalso eating the same food, found\na piece of metal in his meal as\nwell.\nThe person concerned took the\npieces to Mr Mooney, Catering\nManager, who asked what the\nstudents had been having to eat.\nOn hearing sweet corn mentioned\nhe went to the can-opener in the\nkitchens to inspect it. He said\nthat the blade was old and had to\nbe replaced.\nFREE GIFT!!!\nYour very own\nMr Mooney\nSCRATCH and SNIFF\nRefectory meal\nFEUX Friday 31 May 1985 11\n\n"

    "content": "[TETTERS\nLetters\nTo: Aidon Jennery-Broadsheet Editor\nDear Aidon,\nI write with regard to the 'Vicious\nRumours and Dirty Lies' column in issue 13\nof Broadsheet, especially the references to\nLee Standley. The author, who can only sign\nhimself ' X'( further evidence that RCSU\nhacks are ESN?), claims that 'Even Gluids\n(sic) don't particularly like him...and a source close to Gluids (sic) Office tells me that they\nactually regard him as a complete shit-bag.'\nBOLLOCKS! I suppose that your 'source'\nalso told you that the earth was flat, Simon\nBanton is Samantha Fox in disguise and that\nthe Rector works part-time in Gloucester\nRoad Kentucky Fried Chicken. As far as I could make out, there was not one iota of\neven half-truth in your little story. And all\nthis from a column which in issue 12\nquestioned the accuracy of FELIX' s reporting!\nLee is one of the most pleasant blok es that\nI have been privileged to meet in my short\ntime at College, and any suggestions to the\ncontrary merely serve to portray R CSU as a collection of lying illegitimate s, as well as\nbeing grossly insulting both to Lee and to\nGuilds Union. It is a shame that R CSU, which on an individual basis contains so\nmany decent people, is seen once again to\nreduce the C CU system to one of childish\nbitching.\nYour readership may not be aware of the\ngreat help that C& GU has been in the\ntechnical side ot the last few (where few is at\nleast four) issues of Broadsheet. Not only\nhave we lent stencils and reams of paper (of\nwhich ten of the former and five stencil\ncutters) basically, without C& GU Broadsheet would have had very\nconsiderable (if not infinite) problems in\nappearing. Whilst I do not mind Broadsheet\npoking jibes at Guilds Union, this final\nincident has gone beyond the pale; we do not\nwish to assist you in making libellous\nstatements about us and our friends, and\nhenceforth the use of our equipment is no\nlonger open to RCUS\u2014after all, would you\nsupply the bullets for people to shoot you\nwith.\nThere are, however, two stencils which we\nwill readily cut for you; the first is one\nfeaturing this letter (un doctored and\nunedited), and the second a letter of\nunconditional apology for the insulting\nremarks, signed by the true author of the\ncolumn. These would be printed by you or\nyour successor in the next issue of\nBroadsheet. Perhaps then we could review\nthe situation. If there is any integrity and guts\nin R CSU( which seems to be doubtful), you\nwill take us up on this.\nYours sincerely,\nAdrian Johnson\nGuilds Union Duplicating Officer 1984-86\nDear All,\nIt has been brought to my attention that an\narticle in last week's Broadsheet has annoyed\none of its readers.\nThe article in question is 'Vicious Rumours\nand Dirty Lies', a scandal and gossip column\nwhose first appearance was prefaced by the\ndisclaimer: 'Warning, anything contained\nwithin this column is likely to be:-a Totally Untrue\nb Totally Warped\nc Very, very TRUE!' So you can see it is meant as a light-hearted\npiss take column. However, the paragraph\nwhich criticizes third year Mathetician Lee\nStanley, who has been driving (dangerously)\nfor Gluids Mascotry for a long while, and\nwhich advocates the awarding of a'UG A( Ugly Git Award) or at least Anti-social\ncolours' apparently caused Mr Stanley some\ndiscomfort.\nThe paragraph also mentions that Guilds'\nHit Squad flan ned him eight times at the Beer\nFestival and that a 'source close to the Guilds\nOffice tells me that they actually regard him\nas a complete shit-bag'\u2014this source was a RCS man who happened to be standing in the\nMech Eng foyer at the time.\nA popular RCS Bar song does contain the\ntwo lines:\n'S is for Stanley, just see the next line and T is\nfor Traitor, yes that'll do fine.'\nAnd yes, the RCS Mascotry Team have\nunanimously voted him 'Absolute Bastard of\nthe Year 1985',\nI list these points to show the nature of the\nparagraph in question which Mr Stanley has\nsaid is all lies and plans to 'take the matter\nfurther' if an apology is not forthcoming in\nthis FELIX. All the information above is\nfactually correct, if a little vicious in its\ndelivery.\nIn fact the only line which may contain a lie\nis:\n'If anyone sees his car, twist the wing mirrors\nround the wrong way, that really pisses him\noff\n\u2014Perhaps it really WOULDN'T piss him off,\nwho can tell??\nAnyway, from the bottom of my heart I would like to say I'm very, very, sorry to have\ndescribed you in the way that I did and I would ask everyone to ignore the fact that\nyou have deserted your own C CU in favour\nof another, and to judge you on your own\nmerits\u2014like attempting to run over six RCS\nmen who were standing in the road to block\nyour car after the Maths Dinner, one of\nwhom you injured quite badly, when you\nwere trying to steal Theta.\nI wish you every success in your degree\nexams, that you get a good job and are able to\nleave College as soon as possible.\nYours,\nThe a pole get ic sincere, g it X More than thirty years ago Victor Mooney\ncame to Imperial College as Refectory\nManager. His retirement today marks the\nend of an era.\nEver since his arrival Mooney has been the\nbutt of student humour. Generation after\ngeneration have hurled a barrage of\ncomplaints and abuse at the man and at his\nstaff. As his 'empire' has grown the criticisms\nhave become more severe and more\nnumerous. To the detached observer it would\nappear that Mooney is a genial buffoon who\nlistened to complaints and brushed them\naside with always the same tired, old excuses.\nIt seems incredible to me, that a man can\nstay in the same job for thirty years when he is\ncontinually being criticized for doing a bad\njob.\nEver since the 1960s, Mooney has always\nb^ en on the defensive. There have been no\nreally new initiatives\u2014any changes have\nbeen rep on ses to criticism after the event. His\nmanagement style has been more suited to a corner shop than to a vast refectory\nsystem\u2014the man is still living in the 1950s. His successor Mr Northey must be full of\nbright new initiatives and changes if he is to\nhave success.\nDespite Mr Mooney's detractors, chief\namong whom has been FELIX, let it be said\nnow that he is really a very nice chap. The\nloyalty and respect that his staff have for him\nis enormous. He is a man of remarkable\ncharacter. He is truly the last of the old\nschool, and the place just won't be the same\nwithout him.\nGoodbye, Mr Mooney, and Good Luck.\nFelix is published by the Editor for and on behalf of Imperial\nCollege Union Publications Board and is printed by the Union Print\nUnit.

Copies are available in your departmental general office\nor from Professor JC Anderson, Elec Eng Dept.\nThe name of the game is participation. Using the directory you can\ndecide on what line of research interests you and go and see the\nmember of staff concerned. If all goes well you can mutually arrange\nwhat you will be doing, when, for how long and whether it will include\npaid work in the Summer vacation. The Supervisor has to find the\nmoney and how much he pays you is a matter for negotiation between\nyou; we lay down a maximum of \u00a370 pw and the usual period is not\nmore than 10 weeks. The method of payment is by a student bursar y, which means you do not pay NHI or income tax and you do not need a work permit.\nWhat we are not doing is trying to get cheap labour in the\nlaboratories. UROP has a serious educational purpose, which is to\ngive undergraduates the opportunity to learn how research is done\nand, hopefully, make a contribution to the project they join. You can\ncontinue to participate during the term (in your own time) and, with\nluck, may find your name on a published paper or a share in a patent.\nAt the very least, participation can give you a flying start at the project\nwork which is part of your course.

And how\nmany people ate their cockroach\nwithout realising it?\nCockroaches can be seen on\nthe walls and floor of the kitchens\nat all hours of the day and they\nswarm all over the place at night.\nSome of the more daring actually\nwatch the television.\nANY RESTAURANT INFESTED LIKE THIS WOULD BE CLOSED BY THE HEALTH AUTHORITIES! Can Mooney be sup rise d that\nstaff are hard to come by? Would\nyou work in a bug infested\nkitchen? Moreover, the stink of\nrotting food, well known to all\nFalmouth and Tizard residents,\nwould attract all the insect life in\nSW7!!!\nFELIX CALLS FOR ACTION NOW!!! In the next\nissue of FELIX we hope to\npublish a further investigation,\ntogether with Mr Mooney's replies.\nThe matter will also be\ndiscussed at today's Union\nMeeting.\n10\nFELIX asked Mr Mooney for his\nopinions on a possible refectory\nboycott. He gave the impression\nof being upset and offended.\nIn his opinion the standard of\nhygiene in Southside was\nacceptable and not worse than\nthe other refectories.\nMr Mooney said that the\nkitchen staff in Southside were\nmore annoyed than he himself\nwas. The staff were particularly\noffended that the students found\ntheir food inedible.\nMoving on to the alleged\ncockroach in ie station in\nSouthside, Mr Mooney stated\nthat it was no worse than most\noutside restaurants and considerably better than some.\nHe cited the Savoy where\ncockroaches are often seen\ncrawling across the dining room\nfloor!\nHe said that cockroaches were\nbasically clean, harmless\nanimals, despite their ugly\nappearance, and were a neglig ble health hazard. Of much more\nconcern w ere the flies. College\nBlock in particular suffered from\na large number of flies, a nuisance which started during\nthe recent dustmen's strike. Also\nthe Union kitchens were troubled\nby many black beetles coming\nout of heating ducts.\n1970\nGive Southside a chance\n'The standard of cooking has\nimproved in the last fortnight,\nand must be given a chance.' So\nsaid Mr Stephenson at 'Massive\n(Inquorate) Mooney Meeting'\nlast week.\nMr Stephenson (Refectory\nCommittee Chairman) and Mr Mooney answered questions\nfrom the floor. Mr Mooney saw\nno necessity for such extreme\nmeasures as a boycott, but agreed\nthat the standard of cuisine in\nSouthside used to leave\nsomething to be desired. The\ncooks were quite upset by the\nboycott and felt that they had not\nbeen given a chance to prove\ntheir worth, one of them saying\nhe did not know if he was any use.\n1973\nMo'one y returns to limelight\n3 years since last confrontation\nwith Mooney\nCockroaches and mice in\nrefectory\n'We must not be complacent, but\nat least the situation is not as bad\nas in other parts of Kensington.'\nThat is how Dr Levy, Chairman\nof the Refectory Committee,\nsummed up the infestation of the\nkitchens by mice at Thursday's Refectory Committee meeting.\nThe meeting was told it would\nbe necessary to spend \u00a33,350 to\ndisinfect the refectory area of\ncockroaches and mice. This sum\nincluded \u00a31,250 to pay for steam\ncleaning and \u00a31,000 for washing\ndown walls.\nPolice! The College authorities went to\ntremendous lengths last week to\ntry to prevent too many students\npaying the old price for refectory\nmeals.\nThey preferred to take good\nfood from the students and\nTHROW IT AWAY rather than\nallow students to pay the old\nprice. The police were even called\nin the hope that they would be\nable to force students to pay\nCollege's inflated prices instead\nof last year's price.\nMr Dawson, College security\nofficer, warned that students\nwould be liable to prosecution\nunder the Theft Act for refusing\nto accept the inflated College\nprice.\nFFLIX\nFriday 31 May 1985\n\n"

This gave the present students\nan opportunity to find out more about\npossible careers available to them and gave\nthe staff a chance to indulge in reminiscences\nabout classes of students long gone.\nThe department was formed in 1971 with\nSamuel Eiloi as its head. Before that it existed\nas the Management Engineering Section in\nthe Department of Mechanical Engineering.\nWhen the postgraduate course was first\ninstituted in 1955 with two members of staff\nand four students it was regarded as an\nintriguing though somewhat risky\nexperiment, which few thought would\nsurvive, let alone grow into one of the largest\ncourses of its kind in the country. There were\nno business schools in those days, and\nmanagement education in the university\nsector was rather sparse and quite\ninsignificant. Courses in general\nmanagement, or in a particular function of\nmanagement, were available in non-university institutions, but the general ethos\nwas that you acquire your managerial\nknowledge and skill on the job.\nIn the Mechanical Engineering\nDepartment at Imperial College it was\nrealised early on that for engineers to be\neffective in industry, technical knowledge\nand expertise was not enough. They needed\nto know what it costs to convert a design into\na marketable product, how to evaluate\nmarket potential, how to ensure the financial\nviability of their enterprise or a particular\nventure, how to handle superiors and\nsubordinates; in short, engineers need\nmanagerial skills and know how. Most\nengineering institutions have long included\nthese requirements as a necessary\ncomponent of the professional qualifications\nof their members, and at the beginning of the\n1950s the College started exploring ways in\nwhich engineering students could satisfy the\nprofessional institutions in this respect.\nThe first move in this direction came as a result of an agreement between the College\nand LSE, whereby third year engineering\nstudents could go to LSE every week for two\nterms, largely to attend courses in\neconomics, accounting and the structure of\nindustry. Later, a set of lectures was\ninstituted in the College on production\nmanagement with special reference to\nmanufacturing industry, there by marking\nthe beginning of the service teaching activity\nprovided by Management Science staff. This\nservice teaching now constitutes an\nimportant component of the wide range of\nactivities of the department, involving\nhundreds of undergraduate students in\nscience and engineering, particularly in the\nareas of managerial economics, accounting\nand finance, production management, and\noperational research. In addition, the\ndepartment has a modest number of\nstudents on joint honours courses, where\nstudents devote their third year to the study\nof a wide range of subjects in Management\nScience. Unfortunately, this course will be\nterminated soon, an indirect casualty of the\ngovernment cutbacks in education. Both\nstaff and students regret the decision.\nResearch and the MSc in Management\nScience have always been the mainstay of\nthe department's work. There are over 100\nMSc students this year, a far cry from the\ntentative beginning of four students in 1955.\nThis is no longer a risky experiment, but a robust activity with a proven track record.\nThe lecturing staff now number over 20.\nOver the 30 years there have been over\n1250 graduates of the Department. Surveys\nof past students and feedback indicate that\nthey have greatly benefited from their spell in\nthe Department both intellectually and in\ntheir career development. It is also\nencouraging to see the diversity of careers\nfollowed. While some have gone into\nOperational Research and Management\nServices Departments in industry and\ncommerce, there has been a distinct trend in\nrecent years for our students to go into other\nfunctions of mange ment, covering the whole\nspectrum of careers, showing clearly that\nmany of our past students are not content to\nadvise decision makers but have aspirations\nto become decision makers themselves.\nFive years ago it was proposed to set up an\nalumni association using the results obtained\nfrom the surveys of past students.\nUnfortunately those plans had to be shelved\ndue to the severe financial cutbacks all UK\nuniversities have experienced. A restriction\non manpower and other resources meant\nthat all effort was concentrated on teaching\nand research. Today we find ourselves in a reasonably stable position. More positive\nsteps are now being taken to establish an\nalumni association. As well as the central\nbody in the UK, there will be branches\nscattered world-wide. Plans are progressing\nto set up branches in Singapore, Malaysia,\nHong Kong and Cyprus.\nThe variety of research undertaken in\nrecent years is a clear indication of the\nwidening base of the department, which a decade ago was in the main known for its\ninterest in the production planning and\ninventory control fields. These areas\ncontinue to thrive with recent work in\nscheduling and investigations into integrated\nproduction-inventory systems. Other areas\nhave now come into prominence, such as\nfinancial control and corporate planning,\ndistribution systems, foreign exchange\nmodelling, leasing, risk analysis, productivity\nand profitability measurements, graph\ntheory and mathematical programming, the\ndevelopment of approximate solutions to\nqueueing models, the use of simulation and\nindustrial dynamics, and the problems of\nenergy and resources.\nThe department has obviously grown and\nexpanded its activities in the last 30 years \u2014\nit is now looking towards to the challenge of\nthe next 30!\nProf Samuel Eilon, centre, greeting guests.\n6 Friday 31 May 1985 FEUX\n\n"

    "content": "BIOMECHANICS\nDamage to human joints can occur in a number of ways\ninvolving disease, trauma, or accumulated damage arising\nfrom normal activity. Osteoarthritis is a typical example of\nthe latter process and for some people it can lead to joints\nbecoming 'worn-out'. At this stage cartilage has been\neroded from opposing surfaces of the joints allowing bone\nends to rub together painfully. The development of artificial\njoints that are capable of relieving pain and restoring\nfunction in such areas forms the major research\nprogramme in the Biomechanics Section. Most of the work\nis being carried out at the request of orthopaedic surgeons,\nand involves close collaboration with them at all stages.\nOne current project, which is headed by Dr Amis, has\nled to the development of a replacement elbow joint and\nthe surgical instruments that are needed to fit it. Clinical\ntrials on this joint are showing good short term results for\nthe treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. The photograph\nshows the components that make up the joint, and the two\nradio graphs show the side and front view of a joint two-and-a half years after replacement. In the past Professor\nSwanson has produced a number of implants which include\na knee and a hip joint.\nWhen designing the components it is important that they\ncan be fixed reliably to the ends of the bones, and can\nwithstand constant use without loosening, as it is possible\nthat they might have to function in this hostile environment\nfor thirty years or more. The prototypes, which are\ngenerally made of stainless steel or titanium alloys, are\ninitially used in small scale human clinical trials. It may be\nseveral years before problems appear, and it is generally at\nleast five years before the artificial joints are widely\navailable. During the clinical trials close work with the\nsurgeons is necessary to appreciate the modifications that\nare needed.\nWhen implants fail it is important to know why so that\nthe design can be improved. One of the major ways to\nmake them more reliable is to improve the materials so\nthat fatigue failure or wearing out is less likely. PArt of the\nSection's work involves looking at failed implants to try and\ndiscover why they fail, and the facilities available include\nmaterials testing machines.\nThe research activities of the Biomechanics Section are\nnot limited to work on ar it if ici al joints, but cover a number\nof areas. For instance, they are involved in fundamental\nbiological research to try to understand how natural joints\nwork and how breakdown occurs with the onset of\narthritis. Other study areas include fixation devices for\nfractured bones, artificial ligaments for use after knee\ninjuries, and artificial tendons for use after hand injuries.\nThere are also a number of Mechanical Engineering\nundergraduates who are working on Biomechanics\nprojects. They are looking at a number of interesting topics\nsuch as implants to treat leg fractures, the contact pre sure s experienced on bones at the elbow joint, possible use of\ncarbon fibre and ter yle ne fibre for artificial knee ligaments,\nand the design of a hand splint to be used when tendons\nbecome damaged.\nAilments such as arthritis cause a great deal of suffering\nfor a large number of people, and the research in the\nBiomechanics Section is making a valuable contribution\ntowards solving this problem.\nWhen human joints become damaged it can cause severe pain for the\nsufferer. The Bio mechanics Section of the Mechanical Engineering\nDepartment are developing artificial joints that will\nrelieve pain and restore\nsome use to the affected\nparts.\nFELIX Friday 31 May 1985\n\n"

    "content": "BOAT\nFrom Heads\nto Regatta\nThe Boat Club this year has been\ndivided into several different\nsquads and within these squads\nthere has been strong\ncompetition for places in the top\ncrew from each squad.\nNational Squad\nThe club has two members in the\nNautilua VIII, the men's National\nLightweight (LWT) Squad crew.\nBoth members, J Griffiths and W Downing have as a result spent\nconsiderable amounts of time\ntraining at the squad headquarters at Hammersmith. The\nNautilua VIII came fourth in the\nTideway Head and won Open\nEights at Nottingham City\nRegatta. The crew will be going\nto Nottingham International,\nHenley, Lucerne, National\nChampionships and the World\nChampionship in the following\ntwo months. Despite their\nconsiderable achievements in\nrepresenting the club in a National crew they found time to\nrace for the club in the Scullers\nHead. W Downing won three\npennants and came fifteenth, the\npennants included the third\nLWT pennant, the Senior B pennant and the LWT Senior B pennant. John also won a pennant as the highest placed\nNovice Sculler finishing twenty-fourth. The entry of 404 scull ers gives an indication of the quality\nof their performance.\nThe Men's Top Squad\nThis squad got off to a sticky\nstart with coaching from\nnumerous sources. The training\nprogramme in the first three\nmonths of the year nevertheless\nthinned it out to the more\ndedicated oarsmen. John\nMcArthur took over coaching\nthe squad full-time in January\nand proceeded to give the squad\nthe direction it badly needed.\nThe squad had little time to\nprepare fully for the Heads and\ntrained with a view to the\nTideway Head as its aim.\nRegrettably the performance in\nthis event was handicapped by\nillness, and the attentions of the\nsquad were then focussed on\nBedford Head. The squad picked\nup wins in Senior A and Senior B cox less pairs and Senior A cox less fours.\nFollowing Bedford Head a cox less four was selected from\nthe squad, and two members\njoined what had been the Novice\nVIII and the other two formed\npart of a Senior A cox less four.\nThe cox less four trained hard\nwith its eyes set on Ghent,\nNottingham and Henley and\npossibly National Championship.\nAll members of the four had to go\non a diet to trim down to the\nlightweight limit. The crew\nmanaged to make the weight for\nGhent helped by some fairly\nclose to starvation diets. Ghent\nproved to be a great success as\nthe Last 4 gained invaluable\nexperience of racing at an\ninternational level over 2000m, and it had the added benefit of\npicking up a silver medal in the\nUnder 23, LWT 4. On the\nSaturday of the seventh Belgian\nChampionship to pick up more\nrace experience the crew raced\nin the Open Coxless IV's, a non-lightweight event and qualified\nfor the final of the event at the\nexpense of University of London\nand others. In the final of five\ncrews, which was viewed as\ngiving the crew another race\nover the distance, Imperial\nfinished fifth as expected, with\nthe French Composite finishing\nfourth. The crew won their silver\non the Sunday finishing three\nseconds adrift of a German LWT\nComposite. The now changed\ncrew is now training hard with\nHenley and a LWT 4 at National\nChampionships in the forefront\nof its aims.\nThe Men's Novice Squad\nAt the start of the year Bill Mason\nstarted with a strong squad of\nNovice oarsmen. With intensive\ntraining that few if any other\nNovice squads endure, the\ngroup was divided into a Novice\nsquad and a Novice-Novice\nsquad. I hasten to add that both\nnames of reference couldn't be\nmore inappropriate. The Novice\nVIII went through the entire\nHead season without losing.\nThere were wins at Burway,\nKingston, Reading and at the\nTideway Head which is the first\ntime Imperial has achieved such\na string of wins. The emphatic\nnature of the wins and the wins\nthat were achieved in fours as\nwell, looked good for the regatta\nseason. At Bedford Head the\nNovice Squad had wins in all\nfours events they entered. The\ncombined wins of the Top two\nNovice squads gave a club\nrecord of nine wins in one day at\na Head.\nThe Novice VIII won its first\nregatta at Hammersmith and\nthen had to race at Senior C status and above; and since then\nhas won Senior C VIH's at\nMortlake Spring and Senior B VIII's at Thames Ditton. The VIII\ns tre ngh ten ed by two members of\nthe top squad will hopefully\ncontinue in its winning way and\npick up the racing experience\nthat it so vitally needs to achieve\nthe ambitions it has set itself in\nthe Thames Cup at Henley.\nNot forgetting the so-called\nNovice-Novice squad\u2014they\nhave trained hard all winter and\nwith self-motivation and little on\nthe water coaching came close to\nwining at Mortlake Spring getting\nthrough three rounds and losing\nin the final. At Putney Town they\nwon Novice IV's and are now\nlooking to racing at Senior C. The Women's Squad\nThe Women's squad of eight did\nwell through the winter achieving\na very creditable performance in\nthe Women's Eight's Head\nbeating many of their rivals such\nas the University of London.\nSince the Head Season the\nWomen's squad had gone from\nstrength to strength and the VIII\nhas been unlucky not to win.\nIncreased training under the\nsuper vis on of J Griffiths has seen\nvast improvements in both\ntechnique and fitness. At Aipha\nBorrie the women's squad won\nSenior B cox less pairs and\nshowed how well their VIII was\ngoing but were unlucky to come\nup against a strong and\nexperienced Thames VIII. At\nNottingham City the women's Senior B four which consisted of\ntwo novice oars women won an\nthe Saturday rowing through\nDurham and Southampton\nUniversity in a spirited\nperformance. This is probably\nthe best result for an Imperial\nCollege Women's crew for\nseveral years as they were the\nfastest women's college or\nuniversity crew at the event.\nHopefully the successes of the\nyear will be sustained by the\nvarious squads and added to by a recently formed double scull and\nSenior A cox less four.\nFEUX Friday 31 May 1985 13\n\n"

    "content": "\u2022TITERS:\nAcademic\nAffair\nDear Sir,\nI am writing in response to the article Peter\nKlemperer wrote in FELIX number 705\n(Friday 24 May). Much of what Peter says is\ntrue, and I support him, however there are a few points which I must object to:\n1 He implies that science alone is central to\ntechnological bargaining power and\neconomic effectiveness, omitting that science\n(ie knowledge) alone is not as central as the\nengineering for wealth which is a skill. It is\nengineering skill, applying scientific\nknowledge, which underpins our nation's technological developments. Skilled\nmanagement is also very important to our\neconomy.\n2 While I agree with the purpose of the\nNUS campaign to augment the role of Higher\nEducation as the nation pulls out of the\nrecession, I feel that our responsibility as\nA A Os in Imperial College should be to\ndefend the interests of the students we\nrepresent\u2014so that the nation is not starved of\nthe engineers, managers and scientists needed\nto pull the economy out of decline.\n3The A A Os in IC are not there to\ncommunicate with the NUS at all, in my\nopinion, for two distinct reasons; ICU is not a member of the NUS, this being a decision of\nthe student body here. Why does Peter seek\nto act as aNUS rep to IC\u2014he should\nrecognise the views of the students and seek\nto work within that framework.\nThe A AO primary function while I have\nbeen C& GAA O this year has been almost\nexclusively within IC\u2014on College and Union\ncommittees. Although I have attended\nmeetings of UL U General Union Council, I feel that the relationship between ICU and\nUL U and beyond is the responsibility of the\nExternal Affairs Officer and Committee. I sincerely hope Peter is not distracted from his\nrole within IC during the coming year.\nYours,\nLuke Walker\nC&G AAO 1984-86\nRucksack Soc\nDear Sir,\nIn last week's editorial, you mentioned\nthat the Union has achieved quite a lot this\nyear. Yet we still have to capture the students'\nfaith.\nLet me explain\u2014last week you received a petition from some Computing students. It\nresulted from courses being stopped\nfollowing discussion at a staff-student\nmeeting on Friday 10 May. A meeting to\nwhich the Guilds A AO, Luke Walker, was\nnot invited. This year's Computing Dep Rep\nsaw, and spoke, to Luke, and I on the\nfollowing Monday at Council. Despite\nhaving signed the petition, he didn't mention\nthe problem (obviously engrossed in the\ncolourful conversation!). The matter was\nraised at Guilds A A meeting on Tuesday,\nwhere it was decided that it was in hand. And\nyet, we have the petition still handed into\nFELIX\u2014not the Union, not to an Academic\nAffairs Officer, but to FELIX??\nThankfully, having chased up Luke, and\nthe petition organiser, I now understand the\nsituation. By why didn't the Computing\nstudents bring the problem to me, Luke or\neven Ian? AmI using the wrong de oder ant? Yours, upset and mystified\nGraham Thorpe\nAcademic Affairs Officer\nDear Sir,\nI have just put down a bible after looking\nup the references in M Hayes' letter printed\nlast week. I was interested to see which bits\nhe/she had pulled out. You see, I too have a hope! I hope for a world where we can\ndispense with Politics with a big P, and\nReligion with a big R. For to me, they are\nboth obnoxious, because both stand in the\nway of true world peace. I am sure M Hayes\nabhors racism, but how much of it is due to\nsectarianism instead of skin colour? Did we\nnot have proof of this recently in FELIX, with those Israeli/Lebanese letters.\nPlease, M Hayes, and other like him/her,\nlet us dispense with any Religious\nsuperstition and mysticism. Instead let us use\nour human resources and compassion to\nsolve the real problems of the world.\nYours,\nG Thorpe\nMetal 3\nHamlet\nDear Sir,\nHere are some points which we think may\nbe of interest to prospective residents of\nHamlet Gardens and possibly other places.\nThey are the result of a six-month farce over a leaking roof:\n\u2022The legal status as regards repairs to Head\nTenancies is that unless repairs are affected\nwithin a 'reasonable period', tenants are\nentitled to compensation under Section 32 of\nthe 1961 Housing act. The nature and extent\nof compensation is, of course , a matter for\ndiscussion with the landlord, ie College.\nCollege is responsible for all repairs and the\nexcuse that they're doing all they can is\nunacceptable even though they don't carry\nout repairs themselves. It is worth getting as\nmuch down in writing as possible\u2014if you're\nnot paying your rent for some reason, then\nwrite and tell them why.\n\u2022The system of reporting faults to Student\nManagers cannot be relied upon to get\nrepairs done promptly. For example, four\nmonths of reporting a leaking roof using this\nsystem had absolutely no effect.\n\u2022Reporting your problem direct to Student\nServices is much more effective\u2014they will\nusually ring the owner of the flats (who is\nsupposed to do repairs) and will also be\nthreatening if you're lucky. With the help of\nStudent Services we were able to get a rent\nreduction of about \u00a3230 each.\n\u2022 The Hammersmith and Fulham Community Law Centre, 106-108 King\nStreet, W6, will give free advice on all sorts of\nlegal matters, especially housing. Law\nCentres like this one are a valuable asset to\nstudents who are having problems with\nhousing.\nHopefully this information will be useful\nto someone. There is often a temptation to\ngive up in cases like this, but persistent\nnagging usually has some effect eventually.\nYours faithfully,\nNeil Weightman\nMiles Turner\nPhysics 2\nfo foo'l To\n4 Friday 31 May 1985 FEUX\n\n"

    "content": "CRICKET\nFind\nThe\nEdge\nIC Sunday XI vs Silwood Park XI\nAlec Bedser joined in the\ncontroversy last weekend over\nthe future career of IC Sunday XI \u2022\nskipper, Graham. Along with\nPeter May, chairman of the\nEngland selectors, Mr Bedser\nmade a flying visit to Harlington.\nAt a press conference, the\nfollowing statement was issued:\n'In the forthcoming Ashes Test\nseries, with an Australian side\nmissing some of its South African\n'rebels', the authorities at Lords\nhave offered the Australians the\noption of playing between twelve\nand fifteen men per match. It is\nhoped that this will be taken as a gesture of goodwill; the only\ncondition is that one of the team\nmust be Graha.m, the IC Sunday\ncaptain, and that he must field\nthroughout and be allowed to\nbowl at least two overs'.\nA spokesman for the\nAustralian supporters was\nreported to have replied that\nsuch a low down underhand trick\nis beneath contempt.\n'It's true that we make rules\nabout balls per over and who can\nand can't play; but although\nplaying with more then eleven\nmen has historical precedent,\nnone of them could have played\nlike Graham', said Mr Sydney\nOprahouse, Chairman of the\nKoala Lumpur Tea company and\nPresident of the military wing of\nthe Australia Cricket supporters\nclub.\nMeanwhile, the Australian\ntour manager made a similar\ngesture to Mr Bedser. 'Let them\nplay with twenty men, as long as\none of them is Graham', he said,\n'and make Graham bowl just one\nover!'.\nThis followed Saturday's match when Silwood encountered the Sunday XI. Losing the\ntoss yet again, The Sunday XI\nfound themselves in the field. In\nthis 40 overs a side match,\nSilwood began slowly against\nLeyland and Khan who reduced\nthe batting side to 30 for one in\nsixteen overs the ball swinging\nup to two feet through the air-and that was without the\nvase line. When Graham took\nover the bowling he brought\nabout utter confusion, producing\na run out in his first over.\nHowever, the score began to\naccumulate, until five wickets fell\nin seven overs, leaving Silwood\nall out on 160 in the 39th over.\nRichard took four for 28, and\nJeynes three for 20. Le Mesurier,\nthe Silwood skipper and opening\nbatsman gave stability to the\ninnings. However dropped\ncatches, and extras, and\nbatsman 'not being good enough\nto find the ,edge' \u2014 eh,\nDave?\u2014had ensured that IC\nwere set a target that they had\nonly achieved once before. All\nthe Silwood batsmen had scored\na few runs, except the\nexperienced Pramulch\u2014who\nknew what was to follow.\nThe IC innings opened with\nGaskill being bowled first over by\nthe reliable Hamilton. The\ninnings was then given a sparkling foundation by Ayres\nand Richard who took the score\nto 70 in ten overs, before\nPramulch brought about a terrifying collapse, to 93 for five.\nThis included the wicket of\nChew, spectacularly caught low\ndown at cover point by a fielder\non the run; and Smith, out first\nball, swinging across the\nline\u2014obviously taking lessons\nfrom his captain. Khan\nproceeded to steady the innings,\nwith help from first Leyland and\nthen Bradley. A scoring rate of\nthree an over was maintained,\nbut wickets continued to fall. A few imaginative wide s helped the\nscore, but the bowling was\nalways tight\u2014as were the\ncaptain's trousers. Obviously\ntoo much food at tea time. As\nKhan tried to hit out, he sliced a catch to deep backward square\nleg. But it was put down just\nthree yards inside the boundary\nas was the fielder. With nine now\nneeded in five overs, Bradley\ndeparted, bringing in Jeynes.\nGiving a sharp catch and bowled\nchance, and several others in the\nfirst four balls faced, he smashed\na four off the last ball of the 36th over, and Khan did the rest,\nhitting eight off the 37th, bringing\nup his own 50 (eight fours) and an\nIC victory by three wickets.\nPramulch, with four for 19 in\neight overs was the pick of the\nbowlers, while Ballard proved\nslightly worse than Graham (but\nhis batting made up for that\u2014he\nscored eight)\nNeil Murphy didn't bat or bowl\nbut was a jolly good sport. Next\nweek, Neil, next week...The\nMatch ended after eight-o clock;\nthe drinking after nine-o clock.\nNext week we play IC\nUnion\u2014on Sunday, and in three\nweeks we meet IC Ladies.\nAnd Finally, do you know the\none about tea made from Koala\nbears?...\nSilwood: 160 (Le Mesurier 38,\nEllison 20, Long 19, Ameer 15,\nLeyland 1-14, Jeynes 3-20,\nRichard 4-28)\nIC: 164-7 (Khan 51, Richard 47,\nAyres 25, Ameer 1-20, Pramulch\n4-19)\nATHLETICS\nShort\nSweet\nSeason\nThe men were overshadowed\ntwo weeks ago by a compact\nImperial Ladies Squad who\nannihilated the opposition at the\nSouthern Universities Athletics\nChampionship, Reading.\nLadies Results\n1. Imperial 62 points\n2. Reading 46\nMens Results\n1. Southampton 115\n2. Bristol 93\n3. Imperial 60\nOverall\n1. Imperial\nThe Ladies Squad of four(!)\ncomprising, Imoni Akpofure,\nCharlotte Ford, Jo Savage,\nSarah Shaw well deserved their\nwin. Imoni barely missed winning\nin the 100m with a fine second\n(13.7s). In the 800m, Sarah Shaw\nwon comfortably (we promise we\nwon't tell them about the\nopposition!) and Charlotte by no\nmeans disgraced herself with\nsome fine Javelin throwing.\nGood High Jumping from the\nReading girl meant that Jo had to\nsettle for second place with a season's best of 1.60m. The team effort on the part of\nthe ladies was epi tomis ed by\ntheir 4x100m relay performance\u2014a quality win.\nAlas, the 4x100m is not the\nbest point to start on as far as the\nmen are concerned where poor\npractice showed.\nHowever, all was far from\ngloomy; especially for Graham\nHarker, Peter Howes and Roger\nLoughney who all competed very\nwell indeed. Peter, though\ninjured, won both Shot and\nDiscus to bring IC good points.\nRoger\u2014'Hey Mum I 've won a sprint'\u2014Loughney proved too\nstrong for the best in a close\n100m and just missed the Sprint\ndouble coming second in the\n200m. Graham Harker produced two\ngood performances in the 800m heats (2:05.5s) where he\ncomfortably qualified and the\nfinal (1:58.3) where he finished\nsecond in a strong field. Good\npoints were provided by Andy\nGain who competed well in the\n100m, to get to the final, the\n110m Hurdles and the 200m. The men finished the day on a high note coming a good second\nin the 4x400m( John, Jon, Lea,\nRoger and Graham).\nThis marks the end of our\nshort (but sweet) season, at least\nas far as the Imperial team is\nconcerned. Next year we hope\nto fulfil many more fixtures and\nhave good training sessions,\ndetails of which will be produced\nat the end of this term.

    "content": "CGOODBYE MOONEY!\nJ AND GOOD RIDDANCES\nGood\nold\nMooney!\n1955\nIn the Lower Dining Hall\nSuggestions Book, dated 19th February, is the entry:\nWE LIKE MOONEY\nGood old Mooney!\nKeep up the good work!\nKeep off the /\nOn the opposite page, the\ndietician-in-chief has written:\nNoted\nMr Mooney was born in 1923,\nand he tells us that his early life\nbefore 1939 was uneventful. He\nspent seven years during the war\nin the Merchant Navy, and saw\nmost of the world, but not as an\nadviser on cookery! His life as a catering manager did not start on\nJoe's Stall in the Mile End Road;\nit started at the Selsdon Park\nHotel in 1946. From that time\nonwards, he stayed at the St\nJames Court Hotel, the Grand\nHotel at Harrogate, and many\nothers.\nIn 1953, Mr Mooney came to\nIC as manager of Union Catering\nand since that time has taken\nover nearly the whole of the\ncatering of the College. When he\nwas asked what he liked, he\nreplied 'Quieter Carnivals and\ntrifles that are eaten, not used as\nmissiles!'.\nAny profile of Mr Mooney\nwould be incomplete without a reference to Mr Kitchener.\n'At a recent dinner in the\nUpper Dining Hall,' said Mr Mooney, 'I put peppercorns in\nKitchener's soup; but he found\nthem. I put cayenne pepper in the\nfish course; but he twigged it. But\nI got him at last\u2014I put ginger in\nthe cherries of the fruit salad, and\nI can't tell you what he said to\nme!'\nKitchener replied by asking\nMooney to 'come out and have a good dinner'.\nPuke! Dear Mr Mooney,\nThe meal I had with you\nyesterday is all coming back to\nme now. If necessary, I can bring\nit up at the next Refectory\nCommittee meeting.\nQueues Mr Mooney will shortly begin an\nexperiment to prevent the\nenormous supper queues which\nhave of late graced the Lower\nRefectory. The plan is that he will\nguarantee a good selection of\nfood between 6.00 and 7.30. In\naddition the Upper Refectory\nwill now remain open until 6.30,\nwhich should relieve some of the\npressure downstairs.\n1956\nThanks to a magnificent and\ndetermined effort by the\nRefectory Manager, Mr Mooney,\nand his loyal staff, it was possible\nto open the Lower Refectory in\ntime for lunch on Monday,\nOctober 8th. This was despite a series of setbacks which would\nhave surely de moral is eda lesser\nman.\nMr Mooney is one of those\ncomparative rarities among\nadministrators who realise that\nstudents are the one essential\ningredient of a college and that\ntheir needs and welfare must\ncome before all else. He\naccordingly set about his colossal\ntask with his characteristic\nrefusal to be flustered.\nMr Mooney had been\ninformed that the kitchens and\nRefectory would be available for\nhim to move in on Thursday,\nOctober 4th, thus giving him\nreasonable time to prepare for\nthe following Monday. Despite\nvigorous exhortations from the\nPlanning Department, the\ncontractors had to postpone the\navailability until 9.00am on\nSunday, giving Mr Mooney and\nhis staff barely a day in which to\nprepare for serving about 400\nlunches using new and strange\nequipment. A senior member of\nIC Administration informed the\nPresident that he could not see\nhow the Refectory could possibly\nbe used until Friday 12th. However, 'cometh the hour,\ncometh the man'.\nBut even worse was to come.\nOn Sunday morning the kitchens\nand serving hatch were still\nswarming with workmen. Mr Mooney could not start until\n4.30pm. The working squad who\nwere to carry the heavy packages\nof equipment from their storing\nplace in the Snack Bar across to\nthe Refectory packed up their\nbags and went home. Not until\nabout 6.00pm could Mr Mooney\nand his kitchen staff begin their\nmove, and they were assisted by\nabout eight volunteers from the\nHostel.\nOn Monday morning the\nkitchen was a scene of chaos.\nRemnants of painters and tile rs were finishing their work. The\nonly sign of food was a huge bowl\nof steaming soup being\nvigorously stirred by 'Kit' who\nhas been a cook at IC for 30 years\nand who knew of worse times\nthan this during the war. She\nshouted cheerfully 'Don't worry\ndear. The lads'll have their lunch\nat 12.'. Meanwhile dusty plates\nhad been piled into the new\nwashing machine. The switch\nwas pressed, the brushes\nrevolved\u2014but unfortunately in\nthe wrong direction, and their\neffect was not to clean the plates\nbut to fling a spray of water all\nover the kitchen. Elsewhere Mr Mooney was peering into a large\npan of fat. Dense black smoke\nrose into his face and more fat\nwas flung in to avert a conflagration. With the kitchen\nawash in one corner and\nthreat ing to become aflame in the\nother, Mooney and Co battled\non, and so over 400 people\nobtained their lunch little\nrealising the drama that had gone\nbefore. It is as well to retain a sense of humour in such\ntroublesome times as this.\nFeather! Dear Mr Mooney,\nAmong the many diverse\ningredients of my cream of\nchicken soup this evening, the\nonly sign of chicken was one\nfeather. This is a bad thing.\nBoycott Dear Sir,\nIn view of the fact that the prices\nof meals served in the Imeprial\nCollege Refectories are due to be\nincreased by anything from 6d to\n1/6 to make a few comments on\nthe quality of the food that is\ncontinuously churned out in\nlarge quantities for the\ncom sump tion of a mass of\nstudents whose suggestions and\ncomplaints are always ignored by\nthose responsible for the catering\narrangements.\nI am app la ed by the total\nindifference displayed by Mr Mooney and his staff. Several\nrestaurants give better service\nand much better food are lower\nprices than this so-called nonprofit making organisation. It is\ntherefore reasonable to assume\nthat Mr Mooney imagines that he\nhas an absolute monopoly\nwhereas if students would look\naround they would soon realise\nhow they are being treated.\nI therefore advocate a boycott\nof Imperial College Refectories\n\u2022until such a time as Mr Mooney is\ncapable (a) of providing a reasonable service and (b) of\nmeals which are both eatable and\nedible.\nYours faithfully,\nPJ Cunningham\nWire! Dear Mr Mooney,\nA fortnight ago I was fortunate\nenough to find a threepenny bit\nin the bottom of my fruit salad,\nabout which I am not\ncomplaining. Please, however,\nfind enclosed a bundle of wire,\ntwo-thirds of which I had the\nmisfortune to swallow while\neating your otherwise excellent\napple pie.\n1957\nWhen Mr Briggs first produced it\nin October this year, this volume\nwas immediately recognised as\nindispensable to IC students.\nA large part of the book deals\nwith the complaints and\nparticularly interesting is the\nchapter on peas. Mr Mooney's peas hace been variously\ndescribed as lead shot, green\nbullets and indigestible ball\nbearings, but all contributors\nagree that they show little\nres em bla nm ce other than in size\nand shape to the natural product.\nAs they are quite inedible this\nform of fish and chip decoration\nis one luxury we can do without.\nOne contributor asked, in rather\nbad taste, whether they were in\nfact made from real peas or from\nsome synthetic formula for\nwhich ICR holds the patent. The\nCatering subCommittee remained ominously silent on\nthis matter, but it pointed out\nthat garden peas would increase\nthe cost of a dish by about 3d. It is\npleasing to note, though, that\nevidence of the last few weeks\nindicates that a compromise has\nbeen reached, and the peas, if not\ntasting of the genuine article, are\nat least edible.\nPerhaps as typical of the\nsection dealing with complaints\nwe may quote:\n'The white of an egg was\nrubbery, the yolk more so. The\npeas were hard except where they\nhad come into contact with the\negg, which they had dyed an\nunnatural shade of green. The\nchips were leathery and the whole\ndish was quite cold.\nThe author of these comments\nwas told to return such dishes to\nthe counter, to help maintain\ngood standards.\nThe eating habits of domestic\nanimals do not interest the\nCatering sub-Committee. A wood louse was found exploring\nthe suet pudding and two days\nlater five cockroaches were found\nin the refectory. Elsewhere we are\ninformed that a question of\nsupply and demand determines\nthe Brinell hardness of chips and\nthat the square on the cut side of\na sandwich is equal to the sum of\nthe squares on the crusty sides.\nAs a final educational extract we\nquote:\n'For some time I have been\nconfused regarding engineering\nterms: ductility, rigidity, tensile\nstrength, hardness, brittleness.\nYour pastry demonstrates them\nall'.\nRubber! Dear Mr Mooney,\nIf you must serve up rubber\nbands with your kidney t urbi go, would you mind cutting them up\ninto small pieces, as your knives\nare not sharp enough for me to\ncut them myself.\n1963\nDear Sir,\nI am prompted to write this letter\nonly through sheer force of\ncircumstances. After reading in\nthe latest FELIX that a survey is\nto be made on dining conditions,\nI feel that I must get my spoke in\nas a mere Fresher.\nMy main complaints concern\nthe lower refectory in the Union\nBuilding.\n1. Filthy glasses.\n2. Cutlery semi-washed.\n3. The flat plates on which the\npuddings are put radiate heat\nquite efficiently. Result: cold.\n4. Not enough large trays for\nsoup lovers; those of us who are\nnot trained jug ler s are liable to be\ndogged by the smell for the rest of\nthe afternoon.\n5. The servers look and talk as\nif they have 'stood enough cheek\nfrom you,' especially one who\nwill not allow anyone to wait for\nfish, and another who puts peas\non beside all the fish and becomes\noffended if one wants anything\nelse.\n6. Inpenetrable sausages.\n7. Chairs which knock\neveryone else's elbows.\nYours faithfully,\nDD Williams\nOld crock Since the 1st October this session,\nlarge quantities of crockery and\ncutlery have disappeared from\nthe refectory: 250 large knives,\n140 small knives, 180 dessert\nspoons, 130 teaspoons, 80 large\nforks and 570 cups. Mr Henry,\nthe Security officer, was of the\nopinion that by far the majority\nof the missing articles would be\naccounted for by people\nborrowing, but forgetting to\nreturn them. He suggested that a search in the Hostel might bring\nto light vast quantities of\nMooney merchandise as\nhappened when the Hostel was\nredecorated last summer.\n1964\nThe Royal Army Education\nCorps' display in the top\nrefectory attracted many visitors.\nThe officers accompanying the\nexhibition were extremely\nfriendly and said that they were\ndeeply impressed with the\natmosphere in this ' real' university and that they found all\nstudents very courteous. Major\nHarper, ex-President of Durban\nUniversity, seriously said that the\nfood in the upper refectory was\nthe best and cheapest he had\nsampled out of 27 universities.\n8 Friday 31 May 1985 9\n\n"

    "content": "GOODBYE MOONEY! J It took the efforts of one\nman for thirty years to\nmake the IC Refectories\nwhat they are today. That\nman was\nVictor\nMooney\nMooney came to IC in 1953.\nFor the first few years he\nand his food were popular.\nBut while time marched on\nMr Mooney stood\ninexorably still.\nThe quality of the food\ndeclined, criticism became\ncommonplace.\nHere FELIX pays tribute\nto Victor Mooney and\ncatalogues his rise, decline\nand fall.\n1954\nThe Refectory has had another\nchange of management. It has\nbeen running at a loss for almost\nas long as anyone could\nremember, and three years ago\nexcessively large losses\u2014\u00a35,000\nand more \u2014 brought John Gardner & Co to cut them down.\nThis they managed to a certain\nextent, cutting the losses by\nabout 40%. The cut was brought\nabout partly no doubt by\nimproved efficiency and economy, but partly too by a reduction in the total number of\nmeals served.\nThe contract with Messrs\nGardner was terminated on Dec\n23rd, and Mr Mooney is the new\nmanager. A great improvement\nwas noticed last term in the\nquality and value of the food\nbeing served, and it is to be hoped'\nthat the new manager will\ncontinue the improvement. An increase in prices at this time\nwould be disastrous, and can\nonly result in a further drop in the\ncontinued overleaf\nnumber of meals served. As the\noverheads remain the same, it\nwill mean a definite increase in\npercentage losses, though the\nabsolute loss may be less. We\nnotice that the Suggestions Book\nhas been absent for a long time\nfrom its normal perch. Surely this\nis the time to ask for, and study,\nmore suggestions from the\nconsumers?\nThe possibility of supplies to\nthe Refectory from Silwood Park\nhas been studied in great detail by\nthe Refectory Committee. The\nprimary aim was to provide\nvegetables, but it is found that by\nitself this will not be very\nlucrative. Coupled with livestock, however, the scheme\ncan work very profitably, and\nwould supply, besides vegetables,\neggs, pork, bacon and chicken.\nThe difficulty lies in the large\ninitial outlay that will be involved\nin getting 45 acres under\ncultivation. The matter is being\nfurther studied.\nSalad Days Complaints about the reduction\nin the number of l/7d dishes in\nthe lower dining hall are\ncompletely unjustified. The\nappearance of a greater number\nof higher priced dishes has led to\nthe conclusion that there has\nbeen a reduction in the quantity\nof cheaper dishes available.\nFigures show that during a certain period, 147 different\ndishes were offered at l/7d, as\ncompared with 87 at l/9d and 40\nat 2 / - and above. The misconception has arisen from\nattempts to introduce a wider\nchoice of dishes, an effort which\nshould be welcomed by all using\nthis refectory.\n1955\nRefectory Progresses\nThe Refectory is at last showing\nsigns of recovery. Losses in the\nlast two terms have slowly\ndiminished, and there is reason to\nhope that they will eventually\nvanish completely. The only meal\nwhich consistently runs at a loss\nis breakfast, and it seems\ninevitable that it will continue to\ndo so until more custom is found.\nThe progress is due mainly to\nthe efforts of the new manager\nMr Mooney, in close cooperation with the Catering sub-committee. Readers must have\nnoticed that quite apart from\nfood, small things like new lights,\nmore water jugs, racks for trays\non the sides of the tables and so\non have made the Refectory a far\nbetter place than of old. It is to be\nhoped that the improvement\ncontinues.\nFELIX Friday 31 May 1985 7\n\n"
