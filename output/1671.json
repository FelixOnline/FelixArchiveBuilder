This\nbook deals with so many hard questions that\nit would be useless to start writing them down\nhere and, more importantly, it will make you find\ndifferent views no one has noticed before.

Yes,\nyou\u2019ve guessed: the perfect time of the\nyear for some Stephen King! My recommendation\nfor a horror book is Salem\u2019s Lot which, I know, is\nnot the most popular of his books, but it\u2019s the only\none that gave me nightmares.\nThe classic vampire story manages to be scary\nnot due to an unexpected turn of events or\namazing actions you\u2019ve never heard of before,\nbut due to the vivid descriptions. King is definitely\na master of description that can bring to life\nanything, no matter how impossible it seems.\nReadthisandyou\u2019llbethereforBenMears,Straker\nand Barlow.

This book seems so superficial at first sight\n\u2013 you can read it as a nice science-fiction, but you\ncan, again, see so many faces of humanity in the\nstory that it will make you think twice. It might\nlack some style for the fancier reader who doesn\u2019t\nwant to be seen reading YA, but it compensates\nin form \u2013 the story is told as a dossier that follows\nKady and Ezra and, my favourite character, the AI\nsystem. If you don\u2019t trust me when I say that this\nis this decade\u2019s space odyssey, just go to a library\nand open the volume \u2013 you\u2019ll be intrigued enough\nto want to read it and then you\u2019ll say I was right.\n/\n/\nF\na\nb\ne\nr\n&\nF\na\nb\ne\nr\n/\n/\nA\nn\nc\nh\no\nr\nB\no\no\nk\ns\n/\n/\nP\ne\nn\ng\nu\ni\nn\nR\na\nn\nd\no\nm\nH\no\nu\ns\ne\n\n"

Many\nput themselves\nin situations to\ninduce a sense of tension,\nof being utterly in the\nmoment, feeling truly\nalive; fear is a motivator\nfor many a near-life ex-perience, after all. These\ninstances are fairly regular\noccurrences: be it horror\nfilms, deciding autonomously to visit Metric\non a Wednesday evening\nduring Fresher\u2019s Week or,\nperhaps for the downright\nfoolhardy, deciding to visit\nonce again the week after.\nLooking around a busy\ntube train filled to the brim\nwith hordes of commuters,\nmyself included, momentarily brain-dead to their\nsurroundings, what better\nplace to start than with\nman\u2019s undead counterpart:\nthe zombie.\nZombies are a night-mare, but surely nothing\nmore than that? Nature is\na wonderful awful thing,\nhowever. There is a parasitic fungi capable of commandeering the bodies of\nnot-long dead ants.\nResearchers noticed\nthat fossilised remains of\nleaves bared the hallmarks\nof tiny ant bites. These\nfossilised leaf remains\ndate back approximately\n48 million years ago and\nwere found at the Messel\nFossil Pit in Germany.\nIndependent of this, the\nsame ant bite marks were\ntaken from the underside\nof leaves in southern\nThailand. As a prior\nwarning, if you\u2019re an ant,\n(not colloquially) as Ophiocordyceps unilateralis,\nthis fungus modifies the\nant\u2019s behaviour. In some\nsense, having been infeced\nby the fungus, the ant is\nalready dead.\nProfessor Matthew\nFisher from Imperial\nCollege London said\nthat the fungus appears\nto secrete metabolites,\nGuanidinobutyric Acid\n(GBA) and Sphingosine,\nthat are \u201clikely involved in\nzombifying their hosts\u201d by\nhijacking the ant\u2019s central\nnervous system. The ant\nclimbs to approximately\n25cm above the forest\nfloor, biting onto leaves\nin the lower canopy,\nevidenced for by the scars\nseen on leaves in the Rhine\nRift Valley. The fungus\ngrows as a spine through\nthe back of the ant\u2019s\nhead. Once the ant dies,\nthe spores held within\nthe spine explode out and\nshower onto other ants on\nthe forest floor, spreading\nthe infection once again.\nThe fact that evidence\nfor this symbiosis exists\nthrough varying different\nepochs to the present day\nis testament to the tenacity\nof the infection. With little\nto no protection for the\nants, the only solution\noffered by the colony\nis to carry off infected\nmembers to avoid colo-ny-wide infection in what\nsounds like a somewhat\nless PG sequel to Pixar\u2019s A\nBug\u2019s Life.\nOK. OK. I hear what\nyou\u2019re thinking. This is\npretty creepy stuff, but\nthere\u2019s a pretty big distinction between ants and\nhumans. Tell me when\nundead humans can be\nparasitically reanimated.\nIn fact, maybe don\u2019t talk\nto me even then.\nEnter Toxoplasma\ngondii, which infects many\nmore complex mammals,\nA zombie ant apocolypse is coming soon // Wikimedia\nFear is one of the driving factors of human behaviour, but not everything we see in horror films is a fantasy. Science\nalready has a wealth of horrific things, starting with parasitic fungi and moving up to bacterial mind control.\n\u201cZombies are a\nnightmare, but\nsurely nothing\nmore than\nthat?\u201d\nToxoplasma gondii infecting a mouse brain: creepy stuff // Wikimedia\nmay act to maximise the\npossibility of transmission of the parasite to\nfurther hosts. Luckily, the\nbehavioural effects have\nnot yet included climbing\ninto trees to maximise the\nefficiency of spreading\ninfective spores (This is\nperhaps something that the\nobservant reader should\nwatch out for this Halloween). Professor Fisher,\nnoticing my distress,\nadded that \u201cexamples of\nfungi maximising their\npotential for transmission\nin higher organisms are,\nfortunately, rare\u201d.\nWhile the chances of a\nfull-blown Walking Dead\nstyle apocalypse may still\nbe fortunately low, the\npossibility of behavioural\nmodification due to the\npresence of parasitic\ninfections \u2013 immensely\ninteresting and infinitely\nsellable to Hollywood\n\u2013 is still a pretty freaky\nprospect.\nthis next section may make\nfor some grim reading.\nThe bite marks are\nindicative of ants in their\ndeath-throws. Having\nbeen infected with a\nparasitic fungus, known\n\u201cToxoplasma\ngondii infects\nmore complex\nmammals,\nincluding\nhumans\u201d\nincluding humans.

Curly fries\nwill take centre-stage\nin student life, the Felix\nEditor will rarely leave\nthe basement, and sports\nteams will get in trouble\nat some point during the\ncourse of the year.\nI attended my first Communications Committee\nmeeting in the Union\nthis week. I learnt a lot,\nlike what happens in the\nUnion\u2019s inner sanctum,\nand what biscuits are on\noffer there. One question\nthat was discussed a bit\nwas \u2018what is Felix for?\u2019\nand I don\u2019t think I have\na clear answer. Please\nsend in your thoughts on\na postcard to the Felix\noffice!\nIn many ways, the\nrole of Felix is to keep\nstudents up to date about\nwhat\u2019s going on, which\nthen allows them to hold\nthe College and Union to\naccount. You can\u2019t effect\nchange if you don\u2019t know\nwhat\u2019s happening, and\n\u2013 all due respect to both\nthe Union and College\n\u2013 the way decisions are\ncommunicated to students\nand staff can be a little\n\u2018heavy\u2019. Part of what Felix\ndoes is to cut through all\nthat, to try and ensure that\nnothing is done about you,\nwithout you.\nAs such, being in the\nFelix team means listening\nto as many different people\non campus as possible.\nEvery story that we print\nin Felix has two sides, and\nit\u2019s our job to make sure\nthat both those sides are\nheard, so don\u2019t be afraid\nto get in touch \u2013 unlike the\nother sabbatical officers, I\nnever turn on out-of-office\nreplies, mostly because I\ncan\u2019t work out how to do\nit.\nBut another important\naspect of Felix is creating\na community of student\nwriters, editors, illustra-tors, and photographers.\nIt\u2019s sounds a bit glib, but\nI really do believe that\nthere are so many talented\npeople at Imperial who\ndon\u2019t get the exposure\nthat they deserve. During\nmy time on the editorial\nteam, I\u2019ve gone through\nsome incredible content\nfrom student writers,\nwatched new editors go\nfrom strength to strength,\nand shuttled between the\nedit studio and the office\nwith cups of tea for our\nHead Photographer as he\ndoes a sky replacement on\nPhotoshop.\nBeing at an all-STEM\n(well, and business) university means that things\nare a bit different. There\naren\u2019t as many people who\ncome to uni with plans\nready-made in their head\nof becoming journalists\nand writers. You might\nthink that this is a problem\nfor a student paper, but\nactually it can be the\nopposite: the atmosphere\nis a bit more relaxed, it\u2019s\neasier for people to get\ninvolved, and students\ndo it out of the goodness\nof their heart, rather than\nchasing bylines. It melts\nmy cold, icy heart.\nFinally, I\u2019d like to think\nthat Felix is something that\nstudents genuinely enjoy\npicking up and reading\nevery week. When I do my\nrounds of the campus on a\nFriday, dropping stacks off\nin departments I\u2019ve never\nbeen in before, I love\nseeing people grab issues\nhot off the press, eager for\n#content. Even if people\nonly turn to the centrefold\nand Puzzles (shoutout\nto Joe for his Photoshop\nmagic this week, and\nHamish for doubling up\non the Puzzles spread), at\nleast they\u2019re reading. And\nmy job is done.\nOh, and this editorial\nalso gives me a chance\nto spill my guts each\nweek. Better than a diary\nI guess...\nFred Fyles \u2013 Felix Editor\n2\n//Amy Mather\n\n"

A few lines later,\nKendrick mentions his\ncousin Carl Duckworth,\nwho is a member of the\nHebrew Israelites. At the\nbeginning and end of\n\u2018FEAR.\u2019, we hear voice-mails from Carl where he\neffectively explains that\nKendrick, and people of\ncolour in general, feel \u201cHe frequently\nuses religious\nimagery\nto remind\nlisteners of the\nconsequences\nof disobeying\nGod\u201d\nthe concept of \u2018wickedness\nvs. weakness\u2019. This concept reflects the battle between faith and flesh and it\nis immediately introduced\nby the album\u2019s opening\nlines, \u201cIs it wickedness?\n/ Is it weakness? / You\ndecide / Are we gonna live\nor die?\u201d. Kendrick further\nrefers to this on \u2018XXX.\u2019\nwhen a friend, whose\nson was just murdered,\ncalls Kendrick saying,\n\u201cK-Dot, can you pray for\nme? / It\u2019s been a fucked\nup day for me / I know\nthat you anointed, show\nme how to overcome\u201d.\nDespite knowing better,\nKendrick\u2019s gut reaction\nis to seek revenge and he\nreplies, \u201cI\u2019ll chip a nigga,\nthen throw the blower in\nhis lap / Walk myself to\nthe court like, \u2018Bitch, I did\nthat!\u2019\u201d. Kendrick ends the\nverse with, \u201cYou should\nchip a nigga, then throw\nthe blower in his lap /\nMatter fact, I\u2019m \u2018bout to\nspeak at this convention /\nCall you back\u201d, followed\nby a brief interlude: \u201cAlright kids, we\u2019re gonna\ntalk about gun control /\n(Pray for me) Damn!\u201d.\nBy contrasting the violent sentiment from this\nverse with the non-violent\nmessage from the ensuing\ninterlude, Kendrick gives\nan insight to his internal\nstruggle with wickedness\nand weakness. DAMN.\nis a rebuke to the perceived \u2018saviour of rap\u2019\nposition that he\u2019s been\ngiven since TPAB. The\nweight of expectation has\nbecome a burden and, by\njuxtaposing tracks like\n\u2018PRIDE.\u2019 and \u2018LUST.\u2019\n(two of the seven deadly\nsins) with \u2018HUMBLE.\u2019\nand \u2018LOVE.\u2019 respectively,\nKendrick is showing\nus that, while trying to\nremain humble, show love\nand stay true to his faith,\nhe continues to struggle\nwith these sins of the flesh.\nKendrick\u2019s music lends\nitself to controversy and,\nshortly after DAMN.\ndropped on Good\nFriday, the internet was\nrife with rumours of a\nsecond album dropping on\nEaster Sunday, not least\ndue to troll tweets from\nTDE producer Sounwave.\nAlthough no second\nalbum came, it has been\nargued (and since confirmed by Kendrick) that,\nwith DAMN., Kendrick\nactually released two\nalbums in one. When the\nalbum is played from track\n1 to 14, we hear the story\nof the \u2018weak\u2019 Kendrick\nLamar and, when the\nalbum is played in reverse,\nit tells the story of the\n\u2018wicked\u2019 Kung-Fu Kenny.\nThis is hinted at throughout DAMN. and it\u2019s telling\nthat the album begins\nwith Kendrick\u2019s death on\n\u2018BLOOD.\u2019. On the chorus\nof \u2018PRIDE.\u2019, Kendrick\ncroons, \u201cIn another life, I\nsurely was there\u201d, further\nhinting at the duality\nof character that he has\npreviously referred to in\nhis music. At the start of\n\u2018DUCKWORTH.\u2019, Kid\nCapri literally tells us \u201cWe\ngon\u2019 put it in reverse\u201d and\nthe track ends with us\ndelivered four completely\ndifferent listening experi-ences. TPAB and GKMC\nwere met with widespread\ncritical acclaim due to\nthe visceral way in which\nthey evoked the modern\nday black experience\nand DAMN. is almost an\namalgamation of all his\nprevious offerings. While\nTPAB was concerned with\nthe state of the times,\nDAMN. is more concerned\nwith state of mind and self.\nKendrick is an album\nartist in a singles era; a\nunique artist who focuses\non delivering cohesive,\nthoughtful, classic albums\nin an era obsessed with\nchasing easily-digestible\nhit singles. He\u2019s a selfless rapper in a \u2018selfie\u2019\ngeneration and continues\nto tackle societal issues\nand address the problems through his music.\nKendrick has proved\nthat he is undoubtedly the\ngreatest rapper alive. He is\na league above his current\ncompetition and it\u2019s now\ntime to debate Kendrick\u2019s\nstanding amongst the\nall-time hip-hop greats.\nTime will tell where it\nultimately lands in the\nranking of Kendrick\u2019s\noverall discography, but\nDAMN. feels like another\nclassic to instantly add\nto the greatest rapper\u2019s\nimpressive collection.\nverse, Kendrick delves\ninto his \u201cfear of losin\u2019\ncreativity\u201d and paranoia\naround going broke despite his monumental success at age twenty-seven.\nWith storytelling\nalbums, the listener can\neasily get drawn in and\nthere is a danger that\nthe concept behind the\nalbum becomes stronger\nthan its individual tracks.\nKendrick avoids this\nexpertly on DAMN. and\ntakes fans on a journey\nfrom start to finish.\nThroughout DAMN.,\nKendrick repeatedly\nrefers to feeling afflicted,\nbeginning the first verse of\n\u2018FEEL.\u2019 with \u201cI feel like\na chip on my shoulders\u201d.\nIt has been theorised that\nthis chip on Kendrick\u2019s\nshoulder is in response\nto those that continue to\ndoubt his standing as the\ngreatest rapper. Kendrick\ndoesn\u2019t believe he\u2019s\nreceiving the accolades\nthat his accomplishments\ndeserve and this could explain why Kung-Fu Kenny\ncame so hard on tracks like\n\u2018DNA.\u2019and \u2018ELEMENT.\u2019.\nHowever, it\u2019s more\nlikely that Kendrick is\nexpressing his frustration\nat feeling abandoned by\nthose constantly looking\nto him for wisdom, guidance and prayer, whilst not\noffering him the same. We\nrepeatedly hear Kendrick\nbemoan this throughout\nDAMN., alluding to it on\n\u2018ELEMENT.\u2019 (\u201cBitch, all\nmy grandmas dead / So\nain\u2019t nobody prayin\u2019 for\nme, I\u2019m on your head,\nayy\u201d) and throughout\n\u2018FEEL.\u2019. He repeats,\n\u201cAin\u2019t nobody prayin\u2019 for\nme\u201d on its hook, and the\nfinal verse of \u2018FEEL.\u2019\nends with Kendrick\npleading, \u201cI feel like the\nwhole world want me to\npray for \u2018em / But who\nthe fuck prayin\u2019 for me?\u201d.\nKendrick has never shied\naway from discussing religion in his music and this\nalbum is no exception. On\n\u2018YAH.\u2019, Kendrick says,\n\u201cI\u2019m a Israelite, don\u2019t\ncall me black no mo\u2019\u201d \u2013 a\nreference to the Hebrew\nIsraelite movement, a\nbranch of Christianity\nwhich consists of people\nof colour who believe they\nHUMBLE. // Billboard\n\u201cDAMN. has an\noverall more\nmarketable,\ncommercial\nsound\u201d\nafflicted because they are\nbeing punished by God.\nWhile some artists\nfocus on God\u2019s blessings,\nKendrick prefers to focus\non the fire-and-brimstone,\njealous God of discipline\nfrom the Old Testament.\nKendrick has since said\nthat he feels it\u2019s his calling\nnot only to share the joy of\nGod but, more so, the fear\nof God and, in his artistry,\nhefrequentlyusesreligious\nimagery to remind listeners of the consequences\nof disobeying God.\nThis ties in nicely with\nanother of the album\u2019s\ncentral recurring themes,\nhearing the whole album\nplayed in reverse before\nKendrick\u2019s first line from\n\u2018BLOOD.\u2019 (\u201cSo I was\ntaking a walk the other\nday\u201d) is repeated, bringing\nthe album full circle.\nDAMN. has no skippa-ble tracks, which is just\ntestament to the strength\nof the album.

This expansion of the genre is no\nmore apparent than when\nlistening to this latest\nrelease from 20-year-old\nIrish producer Iglooghost.\nNe\u014d Wax Bloom\nblends frantic, syncopated footwork rhythms\nthrough grime, bass, RnB\nand pop. Although this\ncollage of sounds reads\nlike a complete mess, it\nprovides a surprisingly\nuniform product, making\nit unsurprising that the\nalbum was released on the\nlabel of wonky pioneer\nFlying Lotus. Soulful\nvocal samples and sparkly\nsynth lines neatly weave\nbetween hard kicks and\ndeep bass, perhaps best\nheard on \u2018White Gum\u2019: a\n160BPM+ grime banger\nwhich ends in a particularly uplifting breakdown.\nThe grime-influenced\ntracks in general tend to\nstand out on the album.\nPitch-shifted rapping\nbecomes just another instrument in the onslaught\nof sine-waves and dirty\nkicks washing over you.\nOn the more pop and\nRnB influenced tracks\nan undeniable Asian\ninfluence shines through.\nTracks contain scattered\nstring plucks and vocal\nsamples, reminiscent of\nthe productions of Japanese Shibuya-kei artists\nsuch as Cornelius. \u2018Infinite\nMint\u2019 utilises layers of\nbreathy vocals and bursts\nof percussion to make\nsomething both loud and\nintimate. Although, within\nthis intense maximalism\nlies the albums downfall.\nSometimes the footwork\nskeleton of a song is so\nobscured in overdubs\nthe music starts to feel\nfussy and robotic. This\nis particularly true on the\nfrenzied outro \u2018G\u00f6d Grid\u2019.\nDespite this, the\nalbum presents a riveting\ncollection of wonky-foot-work. In a genre full of\nyoung and ambitious\nproducers, Iglooghost has\nundoubtedly distinguished\nhimself from the crowd.\nB\neck is the\nchameleon of\npop music. You\nwant a ballad?\nYou want a rocking guitar\nsolo? You want a funky\ndance song? Beck does it\nall with exceptional ease.\nAnd with new album\nColors out today (13th\nOctober), Beck returned\nto the capital to play a\nsecret intimate show at\nLondon Bridge\u2019s Omeara\nlast Sunday for an \u2018All\nthe Colors Live\u2019 show,\nannounced at 1pm on the\nday. Despite the adver-tising, Beck did not play\nColors in full, but he did\nplay all those aforementioned styles, and more.\nOpening with an introspective ballad section,\ntaken mainly from 2014\u2019s\nMorning Phase, the crowd\nwas hushed, listening\nintensely to Beck and his\nextremely accomplished\nband. In his jet-lagged\nstate, he mentioned that\nthis would be the most\n\u201cMumford moment\u201d we\u2019d\nbe getting, referencing the\nfact that Omeara is owned\nby one of the members\nof Mumford and Sons.\nHowever, this was nothing\nlike Mumford; this was\nnot folk for stadiums,\nthis was folk for each\nindividual in the room.\nHe playfully interacted\nwith the audience, like a\npreacher, between songs.\nHe showed support for\nBono in the face of people\nshouting \u201cFuck U2!\u201d in\nrelation to his recent supporting stunt with the\nband and expressed\nhis dislike for the\nword \u201clit\u201d (he much\nprefers \u201cwowzer\u201d).\nLater on, the big\nhits came thick and\nfast and the party\nreally took shape:\n\u2018Devil\u2019s Haircut\u2019,\n\u2018Black Tambourine\u2019,\n\u2018Dreams\u2019, \u2018E-Pro\u2019, and\n\u2018Loser\u2019, to name but a\nfew. Beck\u2019s music is part\nnise. \u2018Devil\u2019s Haircut\u2019\nhit hard and the crowd\nresponded with manic\njumping and screaming.\nThe temperature in the\nroom rose significantly,\nand didn\u2019t drop for the\nrest of the show\u2019s dura-tion. During \u2018Dreams\u2019,\nthe band gently slowed\ndown the song slightly\nbut this did nothing\nto stop the crowd\nsinging the backing\nvocals so loudly that\nthe band were visibly\ntaken aback, not\nleast bassist\nD w a y n e\nI\u2019ve seldom seen Beck-ter // Aiden Langan\nArtist: Iglooghost.

The\nreport, however, adds\nweight to a growing body\nof evidence suggesting\nthat neonicotinoids, like\nmany pesticides, are\ncausing long-term harm to\npollinator populations.\nNeonicotinoids have\nbeen banned from use\non flowering crops in the\nEU since 2013, but this\nban only applies to plants\nsuch as oilseed rape and\nto sowing treated seeds\nduring the spring or\nsummer. The ban does\nnot apply in gardens or\nto crops such as winter\nwheat.\nEnvironmental groups\nurged the UK government\nto permanently extend the\nneonicotinoid restrictions\nto all crops and commit\nto keeping any ban\npost-Brexit. In June, Julie\nGirling, a British MEP\nfrom the European Conservatives and Reformists\nGroup, led an attempt to\nblock the neonicotinoid\nban. Her bid was thrown\nout by the European\nParliament\u2019s environment\ncommittee, but is seen by\nsome observers as being\npart of an effort by the\nUK\u2019s Conservative Party\nto prevent the proposed\nban.\nOver 100,000 invertebrate species have a role\nin pollination and have a\nconsiderable influence on\nthe production of more\nthan 150 global food\ncrops.\nHowever, the most\ncrucial pollinators to\nagricultural crops are bee\nspecies. Over the last few\ndecades, many pollinator\npopulations have declined\ndue to various human-re-lated pressures. These\ninclude loss of habitat,\nintensification of agricul-ture, a more uniform and\nless biodiverse landscape,\nFetishisation of the Nobel Prize continues\nR\nainer Weiss,\nKip Thorne, and\nBarry Barish received the Nobel\nPrize for Physics for their\ndiscovery of gravitational\nwave: distortions in the\nfabric of space and time.\nThey led the Laser\nInterferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory\n(LIGO) project and\nhelped to make and keep\nit a reality. However, the\nhundreds of scientists in\nLIGO that actually made\nthe discovery received\nnone of this recogni-tion. The Nobel Prize\ncommittee\u2019s refusal to\naward prizes to groups or\ncollaborations is causing\nproblems and giving a\nmisleading impression\nof how a lot of science is\nactually done.\nThe same issues crop up\nall across science. Jacques\nDubochet, Joachim Frank,\nand Richard Henderson\nwon the Chemistry Nobel\nPrize for the development\nof cryo-electron microsco-py, which both improves\nand simplifies the imaging\nof biomolecules, while the\nNobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine went to\nJeffrey C. Hall, Michael\nRosbash, and Michael W.\nYoung for their discoveries\nof molecular mechanisms\ncontrolling the circadian\nrhythm.\nThe Nobel Prizes\nrepeatedly pedestalise a\nselect number of scientists\nas deities, meanwhile\nothers who may have\nhad an equally important\nrole are eliminated from\nhistory.\nAs if by some strange\noccurrence, this year\u2019s\nNobel Prize for Economics could go some way to\nexplaining why the Nobel\nPrize committee are so\nunwavering. The prize\nwas awarded to Richard\nH. Thaler for incorporating psychologically\nrealistic assumptions into\nanalyses of economic de-cision-making. By exploring the consequences of\nlimited rationality, social\npreferences, and lack of\nself-control, he has shown\nhow these human traits\nsystematically affect individual decisions as well as\nmarket outcomes. Indeed\nit would be interesting to\nstudy how these affect the\nNobel Prize market.\nIt may not be entirely\nfair to say the Nobel\nPrize committees are\ncompletely out of touch.\nThis year\u2019s Peace Prize\nwas timely awarded to the\nInternational Campaign to\nAbolish Nuclear Weapons\n(ICAN). But this raises\nthe question: if one prize\ncan be awarded to an\norganisation, can the other\nprizes be awarded to large\nscience collaborations?\nIf only Kazuo Ishiguro\nhad written more sci-fi,\nwe (the Science section)\ncould have had a clean\nsweep!\nScience and the world is changing quickly all around us: does the Nobel Prize need to catch up?\nSCIENCE\nHenry Bennie\nScience Editor\nSCIENCE\n75% of global honey contaminated with pesticides\nLaura Bailey\nScience Writer\nand increased pesticide\nuse.\nExposure may not\nimmediately kill a bee,\nbut the results of studies\nshowing sub-lethal effects\nare concerning.\nImpacts include effects\non immune efficiency,\nforaging efficiency, reproductive success, queen\nsurvival, and changes in\nbehaviour.

At a national\nGreen Party congress in\nJune, founding member\nPeter Pilz, famous for\nuncovering numerous\nscandals among previous\ngovernments, lost his\nplace on the list of Green\nParty parliamentary can-didates. As a result, he left\nthe party and formed his\nown organisation called\nListe Pilz, with which he\nis now running for par-liament. In an interview\nwith Austrian national\nbroadcaster ORF, he said\nhe hopes to provide an\nalternative for non-voters\nand protest-voters, who\nfeel unsatisfied with the\ncurrent state of affairs.\nThe \u00d6VP has also\nundergone change. After\nthe resignation of Reinhold Mitterlehner as head\nof the party last spring,\nforeign minister Sebastian\nKurz took control of the\n\u00d6VP. As foreign minister\nhe gained popularity in\nrecent years for closing\nthe Balkan route (the main\nroute for refugees coming\nto Europe in 2015). He\naims to transform the\nimage of the \u00d6VP, by\nattempting to deprive old,\nestablished party members\nand functionaries of power\nand changing the party\u2019s\ncolour from black to tur-quoise.\nA poll by the Market\nInstitut predicts an \u00d6VP\nwin with 33% of votes.\nThe right-wing nationalist\nfreedom party FP\u00d6 comes\nsecond with 25%. The\nSocial Democrats with\ncurrent chancellor Christian Kern as their candidate\nhave fallen to 23% from\n27% in just one week as a\nconsequence of a scandal\ninvolving a smear campaign against Kurz. Kern\nhas denied knowledge of\ntwo Facebook pages that\ndiscredit and insult Kurz,\ndespite the involvement\nof former SP\u00d6 election\nadviser Tal Silberstein in\nsetting them up. Liste Pilz\nis estimated to get 6% of\nthe votes, followed by the\nneoliberal NEOS and the\nGreen Party with 5% each.\nIt is hard to say whether\nthese predictions will\nprove accurate. Some\nexperts still see the SP\u00d6\nas a candidate for second\nplace.

    "content": "FILM\nFRIDAY, 13TH\nOCTOBER, 2017 FELIX\n26\nfilm.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nThe Death of Stalin: Armando Iannucci returns\nFILM\nAshley Luckyram\nFilm Editor\nS\ncotsman Armando\nIannucci is the\nfinest political\nsatirist of the 21st\ncentury. Through his television shows The Thick\nof It and it\u2019s American\nadaptation Veep, he has\nshown a propensity for\nmocking politicians who\nostensibly claim to have\nthe interests of the people\nat heart, while actually\nonly being concerned\nabout their own agenda\nof obtaining as much\npower and influence as is\nhumanly possible. He also\ndirected one of the wittiest\ncomedies of the new mil-lennium, with 2009\u2019s In\nthe Loop concerning the\nWest\u2019s decision to go to\nwar in Iraq.\nFor his sophomore\neffort, and his first film\nin eight years, he turns\nhis attention to one of\nthe darkest periods in\nEuropean history - the\nStalin-era Soviet Union. It\nis a shame that we had to\nwait so long for Iannucci\nto follow up In the Loop,\nbut this also serves to\nmake his evolution as\na director all the more\nevident. The camera work\nis more refined, as are the\nother technical elements,\nwith costume design, hair\nand make-up, score and\nediting all absolutely on\npoint here.\nThe stakes are much\nhigher than anything he\nhas done before, and that\nis not just because of the\nincreased budget, high\nprofile cast and the weight\nof expectation based on his\nown reputation growing.\nWhere a faux-pas from\nvice-president Selina\nMeyer of Veep may result\nin a couple of days of bad\npress, even the tiniest slip\nin Stalin\u2019s Russia likely\nwill cost one\u2019s life. This is\nestablished early on when\na manic Paddy Considine\nscrambles to get his orchestra to redo a concert,\nwith all spectators still\npresent, as Stalin has requested a recording. \u201cNo\none is going to be killed\u201d,\nhe says unconvincingly.\nWe meet Stalin\u2019s\ncabinet, a group of ageing\nmen forced by their eternal\nleader to engage in boozy\ndinners and watch John\nWayne films, desperately\nstumbling over each other\nto win his favour. There\nis a hilarious tension at\nall times as each man so\nbadly wants to make their\nleader laugh, but is equally\nworried about angering\nhim. Eventually the event\nafter which the film takes\nits name does occur, the\nresult of a stroke. Stalin\u2019s\ncronies gather around their\nboss\u2019 body, which gives\nrise to a running joke\nabout a puddle of urine,\nevidencing Iannucci\u2019s\nuncanny ability to mix\nhigh and low humour to\na devastating effect. So\nensues a scramble for\npower.\nThe leadership falls\nto the hapless Georgy\nMalenkov (an excellent\nJeffrey Tambor). He is extremely unsure of himself,\nand finding a young girl to\ntake an iconic photograph\nwith is seemingly far\nhigher up his to-do-list\nthan running the country.\nThe toad-like chief of\npolice Lavrentiy Beria (a\ndevious Simon Russell\nBeale), positions himself\nwell, essentially calling\nthe shots while Malenkov\nis occupied with getting a\nnew haircut. One suspects\nhe has been planning his\nown ascent to the throne\nwell before Stalin actually\ncroaked. In opposition to\nBeria is Nikita Khrushchev (Steve Buscemi\nsporting a prosthetic\nnose). A twisting plot\ninvolving back-stabbing\nand paper-thin alliances\nfollows. Anyone familiar\nwith Russian history will\nknow what happens, such\nis the accuracy with which\nIannucci draws from his\nsource material, a French\ngraphic novel by Fabien\nNury and Thierry Robin.\nThis is a true ensemble\npiece, with a number of big\nnames who will hopefully\nhelp draw crowds into\ntheatres to see The Death\nof Stalin. The film\u2019s title\ndoes not initially scream\ncomedy, and so this may\nbe difficult to sell to those\nnot already familiar with\nIannucci\u2019s work. Stalin\nis surely one of the best\ncast films of the year,\nwith Tambor, Buscemi,\nBeale, Considine, Jason\nIsaacs, Michael Palin (his\nfirst proper film role this\ndecade), Andrea Riseborough and Rupert Friend\nall excelling. They use\ntheir natural American and\nBritish accents \u2013 Isaacs, as\nRed Army chief Georgy\nZhukov, delivers his lines\nwith a particularly aggressive Yorkshire drawl.\nThis helps tie what is on\nscreen to the modern day,\nas well as establish the\nfilm as comedic right from\nthe off. Also, Russians do\nnot speak English with\na Russian accent in their\neveryday lives, so why go\nfor a half measure?\nExpectations ahead of\nStalin opening the Toronto\nInternational Film Festival\nwere sky high. Iannucci, a\nman who has mastered television on both sides of the\npond and scored success\nwith his debut film, takes\nto the biggest stage of his\ncareer and performs yet\nagain. He does not shy\naway from the horrors\nof the Soviet Union\u2019s\npast, and his unflinching,\npitch-black comedy is\nexactly what we need in\na time that will almost\ncertainly be satirised by\nthe Armando Iannucci of\nthe 22nd century.\nThe Death of Stalin is\nreleased in UK cinemas\non the 20th October.\nRenowned political satirist Armando Iannucci\u2019s second escapade into film. It may be The Death of Stalin but will it\nbe the revival of top notch satire movie making?\nThe all-star Communist cast gathers for a selfie // Photo Credit: TIFF\nDir: Armando Iannucci.\nScript: Armando Iannucci,\nDavid Schneider, Ian Martin,\nPeter Fellows.

New Yorker\ncritic James Wood described it as \u201can allegory\nat once too vague and\ntoo literal\u201d, and I know\nwhat he means. I found\nit difficult to get through,\nbecause it moved slowly,\nwithout the buzzing interi-ority of his earlier works.\nI appreciate subtlety, and\nits overt fantastical nature\ncame across too strongly\nas an allegory.\nHowever, The Buried\nGiant was evidence of\nIshiguro\u2019s unpredicta-bility, his willingness\nto push boundaries and\nexperiment with new\nmaterial. In the interviews\nafter the book came out,\nIshiguro revealed that he\nhad originally intended\nto set the book in a more\nfixed point in time and\nspace, but decided to set\nit in the gap in historical records about what\nhappened after the Roman\noccupation of the British\nIsles. He was attracted by\nboth the uncertainty over\nwhat happened and its\ndistance from contemporary events. Perhaps it is\na bold statement about the\nuniversality of his themes:\nfragility of memory and\nrelationships.\nIndeed, despite his\ntendency to push genres,\nIshiguro\u2019s themes recur\ntime and again. In fact,\nthe writer himself often\nmaintains that he \u2018writes\nthe same book over and\nover again\u2019. Perhaps that\nis where his charm lies:\nin the expression of such\nuniversal human truths\nand struggles that stand\nacross time and space,\nmanifesting and distinct\nand independently enjoyable stories.\nAs a long-time Ishiguro\nfangirl, I was delighted to\nhave a chance to meet the\nwriter at an event at the\nSouthbank Centre early\nlast year. Ishiguro and\nDavid Mitchell (author of\nCloud Atlas) appeared on\nstage together to discuss\nwriting, inspiration and\nthe nature of fantasy. After\nthe event, I got Ishiguro to\nsign my hardback copy of\nThe Buried Giant (given to\nme as a birthday present),\nand told him that I really\nliked his books and that\nThe Remains of the Day\n\u201cchanged my life\u201d. In\nperson, Ishiguro exuded\n\u201cPerhaps\nthat is where\nhis charm\nlies: in the\nexpression of\nsuch universal\nhuman truths\nand struggles\nthat stand\nacross time\nand space\u201d\nan aura much like his\nwords: calm, unassuming,\nbut with an undercurrent\nof a complex interior. The\nonly difference perhaps,\nis the occasional dash of\ndown-to-earth humour in\nperson.\nThe Nobel Prize in\nLiterature is the second\nmost speculated upon\nafter the Peace prize, and\nevery year people place\nbets on various favourites.\nMore or less the highest\naccolade a writer can get\nfor a body of work rather\nthan winning prizes for\nindividual works, the prize\nwas given controversially\nto Bob Dylan last year,\nwhich opened up a whole\nnew world of speculation\nas to what exactly can be\nconsidered \u2018Literature\u2019.\nMany critics suggested\nthat, after last year\u2019s\nunconventional choice,\nthe Nobel Committee\nwould go with a more\nconventional choice this\nyear. Despite that, Kazuo\nIshiguro never appeared\non many of these lists of\n\u2018conventional\u2019 writers\ntipped to win.\nIndeed, the writer\nhimself seemed as surprised at his win as the\ncritics, but I must say\nthat for me it was a very\npleasant surprise. Ishiguro\nis most certainly in the\ncategory of \u2018conventional\u2019 winners, but unique\nperhaps because most past\nwinners tend to be either\nless well-known by the\ngeneral public, or their\nwins are of a political\nnature.\nFor example, when the\nChinese writer Mo Yan\nwon in 2012, human rights\nactivists were not happy,\nsaying that he was too\nclose to the party, while\nothers said his works were\nquietly subversive. People\nstill wonder if Salman\nRushdie will ever win the\nprize, given the controversial nature of his books\nand the fatwa against him\nfor alleged irreverence\nagainst Islam.\nIshiguro might not\nbe as widely popular as\nMurakami, but he is still\ngenerally well-known,\nespecially with the brilliant film adaptation of\nThe Remains of the Day\nstarring Anthony Hopkins\nand Emma Thompson,\nand that of Never Let Me\nGo. Perhaps he will rival\nMurakami in popularity\nafter this win. In my\nopinion, Ishiguro is well\ndeserving of the prize,\nfor both the delicate,\nunassuming beauty of his\nlanguage and his equally\ndelicate handling of the\ndeepest, most complex\ncorners of the human\npsyche.\n\n"

This\nwas the question posed\nto the 5,313,564 inhabitants of Catalu\u00f1a, of\nwhich an overwhelming\n90% voted \u201cyes\u201d, with a\nturnout of 42.3%.\nWhile it is true that the\nright to self-determination\nis a fundamental human\nright, and that the people\nshould dictate the government and not vice versa, it\nis of no surprise that this\nreferendum was deemed\nillegal by the Spanish\nconstitutional court (a\nruling corroborated by the\nEuropean Commission).\nNot because of the question that is being asked,\nbut because of the way\nthat this question is being\nasked to the Catalonian\npeople.\nA review by international observers concluded the referendum did not\ncomply with international\nthe effects of the declaration of independence to\nundertake talks to reach\nan agreed solution. The\nconflict with Spain can be\nresolved in a negotiated\nway\u201d.\nHe effectively declared\nCatalonian independence then took it back\nin the next breath. This\ncaused havoc in central\ngovernment and Spanish\nPrime Minister Mariano\nRajoy has encouraged\nPuigdemont to clarify his\nstatement. If Puigdemont\nrefuses to back down,\nRajoy can retaliate by\nactivating Article 155\nof the constitution. This\nessentially allows the\ncentral government to take\ncomplete control over its\nautonomous communities\n(i.e. Catalu\u00f1a) and allows\nit to take \u201cnecessary measures\u201d to force the region\nto comply with laws and\nobligations imposed by\ncentral government.\nYet again, the Spanish\ncentral government has\n\u201cCatalonians\nare angrier\nand more\nfrustrated\nthan ever as\ntheir voices are\nsilenced\u201d\n\u201cThere is no\nlegal way for\nCatalonian\npeople to\ndecide if they\nwish to be\nSpanish or not\u201d\n\u201cInstead of\ndialogue,\nSpain crushes\nany possibility\nof agreement\nby using force\u201d\nAida Manzano\nKharman\nPolitics Writer\nstandards owing to numerous irregularities. These\nincluded people being\nallowed to vote multiple\ntimes and use homemade\n\u2018voting slips\u2019. Some ballot\nboxes were placed in the\nstreet, allowing citizens\nto vote without being\nregulated, and transported\nwithout having been\nsealed. There were also\nsuggestions some ballot\nboxes may have contained\nvotes before arriving at\npolling stations.\nEven if the referendum\nhad been carried out to\ninternational standards,\nit would have still been\nillegal under Spanish\nconstitutional law, and it is\nhere that the real problem\nresides. There is no legal\nway for Catalonian people\nto decide if they wish to\nbe Spanish or not. The\ngovernment offered no\nlegal dialogue or alternative to the people of Catalonia to ask them about\ntheir national identity.\nInstead, they sent the\npolice and civil guards to\nensure this referendum did\nnot happen, even if that\nincluded the use of force.\nWe are left with the\nquestionable result of an\nillegal referendum which\nOnly 42.3% of Catalonians were able to vote after police were sent to prevent the referendum // Nina A J G\nleft Catalonians angrier\nand more frustrated than\never because their voices\nare repeatedly silenced.\nThe aftermath was no\nless problematic than the\nreferendum itself.

In the cavernous\nhalls of the Barbican\nCentre, zine makers, short\nfilm directors, poets, and\nphotographers set up\nworkshops, encouraging\nthe public to get involved\nand displaying their art.\nI made a zine, watched a\nshort film, and listened\nto some poetry. It was\nall about collaboration\nand identity, which were\nthemes strongly apparent\nin the Basquiat exhibition.\nBasquiat left home\nwhen he was 17 and\nstarted his art career as a\ngraffiti artist in New York\nCity, a grossly deprived\nand bleak city. Graffiti\nbecame popular at this\ntime (1980s) to brighten\nthe harsh, brutalist environment and leave statements of protest. Basquiat\ncollaborated with a school\nfriend Al Diaz to create\nthe graffiti tag SAMO\u00a9.\nTheir graffiti was unusually poetic and became\nthe talk of New York\u2019s\nartistic circles. Eventually\nwhen the duo\u2019s identities\n\u201cBasquiat\nformed a\ncommunity\naround a close-knit group of\nartists\u201d\n\u201cJacob Sam-La\nRose is trying\nto promote\nthe idea that\nabsolutely\nanyone can\nwrite poetry\u201d\nwere revealed SAMO\u00a9\ndisbanded. Within a few\nyears, Basquiat\u2019s fame had\ngrown, leading most from\nan unlikely friendship\nwith Andy Warhol whom\nhe met by selling him\nthree handmade postcards,\neach for a dollar. During\nhis life, tragically cut short\nby drugs, Basquiat formed\na community around a\nclose-knit group of artists\nwho would gather to party,\nplay New Wave music and\nmake art.\nThis spirit of entrepreneurship and working with\na range of contemporary,\nunusual media, creating\nspaces was at the centre\nof Too Young for What,\nin which attendees, particularly young people,\nwere encouraged to get\ninvolved in making art.\nIn one of the rooms,\nHolly Casio was running\na workshop on zine-mak-ing. Casio is an artist who\nroots in pop culture and\nhas strong feminist and\nqueer bias. The latest\nfeature from her zine is a\nwarm, educational, and\nhumorous comic on OCD.\nIt is illustrated with deceptively simply linework,\nbrimming full of expres-sion, reminiscent of Nick\nSharatt\u2019s illustrations for\nchildren\u2019s and young adult\nfiction such Jacqueline\nWilson\u2019s Tracy Beaker.\nAlso featured was Jacob\nSam-La Rose, a poet\nwhose work has now been\nfeatured in some English\nA-Level curricula. He lead\na workshop promoting\nspoken word emphasizing\nthe importance of creative\nexpression and collaboration between artists.\nHighlighting that the best\nwork comes from learning\nfrom others and exploring\noneself in relation to one\u2019s\npeers. Rose\u2019s connection\nto Basquiat was apparent \u2013\nhe\u2019d written a poem about\nBasquiat\u2019s confidence the\nyoung artist had in his\nown art. In an age where\nyoung artists are increasingly asked to be their own\npromoter and advocate,\nSam-La Rose is trying to\nbattle the misconception\nmany young people have\nthat because of their\nbackground they cannot\nsucceed in the world of\nart, and trying to promote\na the space for people to\ndevelop this confidence\nand the idea that anyone\ncan write poetry.\nNot all of the works\nfeatured had direct links\nto Basquiat: Grasp the\nNettle, a feature length\ndocumentary made by the\nWeAreChange collective\n(which is available on\nYouTube) concerns a\ngroup of lands rights\nactivists struggling against\ncorporations, government,\nand police in order to set\nup a eco village in an abandoned plot in Brentford.\nThey aimed to be entirely\nself sufficient \u2013 live literally off the (National) grid\nand survive off food they\ncollected in supermarket\nskips. In doing so they\nattempt to create a self-made community away\nfrom an increasingly\nconsumerist world, exploring a rebellion against\nthe state and modern way\nof living. The film shows\nhow the village soon\nattracts outcasts who most\nimportantly found a sense\nof place in this community.\nIn bringing together the\nmany facets of Basquiat\u2019s work and psyche,\nthe Barbican created a\nsuccessful day that will\nhopefully inspire a new\ngeneration of young artists\nto believe that they can\nbuild their own communities and succeed in the\nworld of art.\nYeah, this portrait looks nothing like me // Tristan Fewings / Getty Images\nmakes zines \u2013 cheaply\nproduced magazines \u2013 on\nthe themes of self-explo-ration.

The problem:\nfew stores had the sauce\nin adequate numbers, if\nat all, and the result was\nhundreds of Rick and\nMorty fans left disap-pointed. In some stores,\npolice had to be called,\nas people were unable to\ncontain their anger at the\nemployees being unable\nto supply them with a TV\ntie-in joke.\nA bit of background\nis needed: this particular\nSzechuan sauce has been\nreferred to multiple times\nthroughout the third\nseason of Rick and Morty,\nserving as a kind of plot\ndriver for the exploits of\nthe misanthropic, genius\ninventor Rick, and his\nbeleaguered grandson\nMorty. Justin Roiland,\none of the co-creators of\nthe show, received a jar\nof the sauce earlier in the\nThe fans of Rick and\nMorty have become a\ncultural entity all of their\nown.

It\u2019s a perfect\nexample of what Pulitzer\nPrize-winning critic Emily\nNussbaum calls \u2018the Bad\nFan\u2019 \u2013 proponents of a\nshow who will stop at\nnothing to defend it. In a\nrecent article, the AV Club\nwriter Clayton Purdom\ncomplained that the\nshow\u2019s fans are \u201cgetting\nreally fucking hard to deal\nwith.\u201d\nWhile #saucegate might\ncapture a particularly\nembarrassing aspect of\nfan culture \u2013 perhaps a\nby-product of countless\nTV shows that tell the\naudience that to be smart\nyou have to be cruel \u2013 the\nway McDonald\u2019s attempted to exploit the hype\nactually shows something\nmore interesting: the\nworrying trend of hy-per-capitalist institutions\nmaking use of internet\nculture as a marketing\ntool.\nFrom Doritos using\nmemes to advertise on\nTwitter, to pop stars attempting to generate viral\nvideos in exchange for\nalbum listens, no aspect\nof the web is safe from\nmonetisation. Indeed, it\ncould be argued that this\nis the basic purpose of the\ninternet. As Jaret Kopek,\nauthor of the Silicon\nValley-satire I Hate the\nInternet writes:\n\u201c[The Internet] was\ndesigned with the sold\npurpose of maximizing\nthe amount of bullshit that\npeople typed into their\ncomputers and telephones.\nThe greater the intercon-nectivity, the greater the\nprofits. It was feudalism\nin the service of brands,\nand it rested on inducing\nWell actually, Morty, you need to be very clever to understand this show // Adult Swim\nhuman beings to indulge\nin their worst behaviour\u201d.\nThe fashion house\nGucci attempted to do this\nearlier this year, as part\nof their promotion for a\nwatch collection. They\nenlisted artists and \u201cmeme\ncreators\u201d, to generate a\nseries of advertisements\nthey hoped would spark\nthe internet alight. In\none \u2018meme\u2019, the caption\n\u201cWhen you get a new\nwatch but you don\u2019t have\nany friends to show it to\u201d\nsits above a pre-Raphael-ite painting, upon which\nGucci \u2018swag\u2019 has been\nsuperimposed, in a clear\nreference to the \u2018classical\nart memes\u2019 that dominated\nthe internet a few years\nago. The campaign was a\nfailure.\nIt makes sense for these\ncompanies to jump on\nthe meme bandwagon.\nThe internet thrives on\nsuch user-generated\ncontent, which has little\nto no intellectual property\nregulation. After all, copyrighting a meme would\nremove its lifeblood:\nthe ability to share and\nalter it. For corporations,\nmeme culture represents\nthe intersection of two\nmarket goals: an engaged\nconsumer base, and free\ncontent-production. But\nfor those interested in\nmemes, such attempts at\nmonetisation will always\nfail, since they tend to kill\nof the very meme they are\nexploiting. Once Burger\nKing starts tweeting, the\nmeme is dead.\nWhile the Szechuan\nsauce promotion, and its\nresulting fiasco, might\nreveal something about\nthe nature of some\ndie-hard Rick and Morty\nfans, who were willing to\ntravel hundreds of miles\nto partake in an internet\nin-joke and scream at\nminimum-waged staff,\nit actually tells us more\nabout how marketing can\nwork in the digital age. It\nis unlikely that this trend\nwill change anytime soon.\nUntil then, hide yo\u2019 kids,\nhide yo\u2019 memes.\nEmbarassing // Gucci\n\u201c#saucegate\nreveals the\nworrying\ntrend of hyper-capitalist\ninstitutions\nusing memes\nas marketing\u201d\nsummer, prompting speculation from fans of the\nshow about what would\nhappen next.\n\n"

    "content": "ISSUE 1671\nFELIX\n29\nTRAVEL travel.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nElina Michaelidou\nTravel writer\nE\nvery day, many\npeople travel.\nWhether for busi-ness, studies, or\nleisure \u2013 the list is endless.\nTravel is their living, their\nfuture, or their relaxation,\nbut why else do people\nchoose to travel abroad?\nThere are many\nanswers, but what I am\nlooking for is medical\ntourism. Now, some of\nyou may wonder what that\nis and others may question\nhow medicine can relate to\ntourism. So let\u2019s start from\nthe beginning.\nThe literal part\nDifferent types of\ntourism categorize both\nthe reasons for and the\nways of travelling, as well\nas the places people travel\nto. For example, there\u2019s\ninternational tourism and\ndomestic tourism: the first\ndescribes travelling to\nanother country, while the\nsecond describes travelling to another city/region\nwithin the home country.\nIn the same way, the term\nmedical tourism refers\nto travelling to another\ncountry for medical\nreasons. The Medical\nTourism Association gives\na nice definition of what\nexactly medical tourism\nis: \u201cMedical Tourism is\nwhere people who live\nin one country travel to\nanother country to receive\nmedical, dental, and\nsurgical care while at the\nsame time receiving equal\nto or greater care than they\nwould have in their own\ncountry, and are travelling\nfor medical care because\nof affordability, better\naccess to care, or a higher\nlevel of quality of care.\u201d\nSo if you have an illness\nor need emergency health\ncare that your country is\nunable to provide, then\ntravelling may be the\nonly choice, and can even\nsave your life. In this\ncase, travel is literally\nthe best, or \u2013 more accurately \u2013 the only remedy.\nThe mixture\nHowever, this kind of\ntourism doesn\u2019t apply to\nemergencies only. Many\ncountries advertise their\nmedical expertise, inviting\npeople for cosmetic\nsurgeries, physical treat-ments, and relaxation ther-apies. Thus, travellers get\na chance to not only experience the medical benefits\nof their trip but also enjoy\nthe beauty of the place\nthey\u2019re visiting. In my\nopinion, this is a perfect\nexample where travel can\nact as both a literal and\na metaphorical remedy.\nThe metaphorical part\nBut there are more\nmetaphorical aspect to the\nterm \u2018remedy\u2019. Travelling\nis known to have a lot\nof non-physical benefits,\nwhich indeed are the\ndriving force for many\npeople to keep travelling:\nyou can broaden your\nhorizons by visiting\ncountries with a different\nculture than yours, getting\na taste of the way the\nlocals live, communicating with them, trying\nthe local cuisine, etc.;\nyou can improve your\ncommunication skills in\na foreign language; you\ncan fight your fears, for\nexample, a fear of heights\nby travelling by plane,\nadmiring the view of a\ncity from a tall building,\nclimbing a mountain,\ndoing bungee jumping,\netc.; you can relax on\nthe beach or exercise by\nhiking, cycling, climbing;\nyou can learn to be more\norganized and to manage\nyour time, so you don\u2019t\nmiss any important events,\nsuch as flights; you can\neither strengthen ties\nwith the people you are\ntravelling with or understand yourself better (if\ntravelling solo); you can\ngain confidence by getting\nout of your comfort zone;\nyou can meet new people\nby interacting with locals\nor other members of your\ngroup if you are on an organised tour; and last but\nnot least, you can collect\nprecious memories (and\nmany photos)!\nSo keep travelling \u2013\nbecause it can be a treat,\nnot only to your body, but\nalso to your soul!\nEd: For more travel\nstories and advice, please\nfollow Elina\u2019s blog\nempnefsysandtravel.com.\nWhy travelling is the best remedy \u2013 literally and\nmetaphorically\n\u201cIf you need\nemergency\nhealth care\nthat your\ncountry is\nunable to\nprovide, then\ntravelling may\nbe the only\nchoice\u201d\nTRAVEL\nTravelling can often be a healing experience, but not necessarily in the ways you might think\nWhile some people may travel for life-saving treatment, for many others travel remains an important part of their self-care // Pixabay\nIC Masseur Society had gotten really professional this year // Pixabay\n\n"

The thrill of\ninstant gratification takes\nprecedence over the dull\nand laborious wait that\ninevitably precedes the\nonset of sleep. When time\nis limited, our attention becomes a commodity \u2013 and\nit is this commodification\nthat has heralded in the era\nof ubiquitous computing.\nSaying \u201cyes\u201d to our smartphone is saying \u201cno\u201d to\nsleep. Chronic sleep loss\nis commonplace in today\u2019s\nsociety, yet even among\nthe brightest of individu-als, we are unaware of the\npotential health effects of\nhabitual sleep restriction.\nIn 2015, the American\nThoracic Society heavily\nemphasised the impact\nthat good quality and\nquantity of sleep could\nhave on our physical and\nmental health along with\noverall quality of life.\nThe researchers suggest\nthat a lack of sleep could\nresult in decreased focus\nand health issues, among\nmany other problems.\nAt the back of our\nminds we know that\nthe well-known maxim\n\u2018quality over quantity\u2019\nholds true in the case of\noptimising productivity\nand enjoyment. Scientific\nliterature over the years\nhas shown that we lose\nself-awareness when\nsleep-deprived; whilst\nwe might think we are\nbeing hyper-productive\nthrough virtue of spending\nmore time on an activity,\nin reality we become\nbiologically impaired and\nfall victim to Parkinson\u2019s\nlaw \u2013 where an activity\nfills the time we have set\naside to complete it.\nWe all have experiences\nwhere we know this to\nbe true: during one group\nproject, we ended up\npulling an all-nighter.\nHaving begrudgingly\nagreed to stay late for a\ngroup project, initially\nthere was enthusiasm\nand excitement. This was\nshort-lived. The remainder\nof the session consisted of\ntyping, on average, three\nwords per hour. We missed\nthe submission deadline.\nSleep is a natural period of\nrest for the mind and body\nand one that is essential\nto our lives. Perhaps the\noutcome would have been\ndifferent had we realised\nthis.\nMild sleep-deprivation,\nwhen appropriate, is\noften necessary and can\nbe temporarily overcome.\nPolyphasic sleep, the\npractice of sleeping at set\ntimes throughout the day\nin order to cut down on\ntotal hours slept, can help.\nDrugs that help us fend\noff sleepiness \u2013 mainly\ncaffeine \u2013 have become\npervasive in society.\nHowever, for most people,\ndeveloping a habit of sustaining enough sleep for\ntheir genetic disposition\nwill help individuals live\nfuller lives. Lives that fill\ntheir internal barometers\nfor the aspects of life that\nmatter most: health, work,\nlove and play.\nIt is not enough to know\nthat sleep is important;\naction to support this fact\nis required. In our micro-the importance of sleep\nhygiene and sleep itself.\nBenefits are wide-ranging,\nan example being that\neating habits and weight\ncontrol are better when\nwe are not overtired. It is\nsomething that we believe\ncould be achieved with\nrelative ease.\nOur Sleep Imperial\ncampaign hopes to transform the way you perceive\nsleep and improve your\ngeneral wellbeing. In the\nmeantime, set a caffeine\ncurfew \u2013 cut the caffeine\nprior to 6pm. Black it out\n\u2013 keep your electronics\naway from your bed, and\nturn off all unnecessary\nlight around your room to\nmaximise sleep quality.\nMeditate for 10-15\nminutes prior to sleep, or\nlisten to some Autonomous Sensory Meridian\nResponse (ASMR) recordings \u2013 this will calm\nyour body and prepare you\nfor sleep.\nKeep an eye out for\nfurther tips at Sleep\nImperial events around\ncampus later this year\nstarting with our launch\nevent at midday on 13th\nNovember 2017 in the\nChaplaincy.\nCampaigning for a\nbetter Imperial\nE\narlier this year when I ran to become\nyour Campaigns Officer, I spoke\nabout the ways in which previous\ncampaigns have changed the very\nfabric of the Imperial that we know and love.\nI referenced the way in which we lobbied for\nquality affordable accommodation for all our\nstudents, and for free universal healthcare\ncoverage for our international student\ncommunity \u2013 success or failure, over the years\nthere have been many excellent campaigns\nthat have had a profound impact on our\nuniversity experience.\nWhat I did not highlight in great detail\nwas the scope for improvement at Imperial\n\u2013 improvement that only effectively-run\ncampaigns can deliver for the student body. It\nis my hope that the rapidly-changing campus\nculture, partly driven by changes in senior\nCollege and Union leadership, will sustain a\ndrive towards more active engagement with\ncampaigns from a greater cross-section of\nthe entire student body. My priority this year\nis to support the student body to not only\ninitiate campaigns, but to follow-through and\nsuccessfully execute them in a meaningful\nway, beneficial to the organisers \u2013 in a\npersonal and professional manner \u2013 and the\nwider community.

I\u2019m\nnot a fan of historical\nnovels and was aware of\nthe difficulties that come\nwith moving from short\nstories to novels. My fears\nwere unfounded, George\nSaunders\u2019 first novel is a\ntriumph. To even call it a\nhistorical novel boxes it\nin too tight, even calling\nit a novel is restrictive, it\nis quite unlike anything I\nhave ever read before.\nThe first thing you will\nnotice upon picking up the\nbook and flipping through\nthe pages is how weird it\nlooks inside. Please don\u2019t\nbe put off, all will become\nclear. The novel is entirely\ncomposed of dialogue and\nquotations from historical\ntexts (some of these texts\nare fictitious, but Saunders\ncould fool even the best\nhistorians).\nBoth dialogue and\nquotations appear in the\nsame format creating a\nlarge chorus of often contradictory voices. This in\nthe hands of others would\nseem clunky and possibly\njust literary bravado, but\nthe genius of Saunders\u2019\nconstruction becomes\nwonderfully apparent at\nthe climax and is the best\nrealisation of the plot.\n\u201cEven calling\nit a novel is\nrestrictive, it\nis quite unlike\nanything I\nhave ever read\nbefore\u201d\nThe Lincoln of the title\nis eleven-year-old Willie\nLincoln, beloved son of\nthe President of the United\nStates Abraham Lincoln,\nwho dies of typhoid fever\n20 February 1862. We\nfollow Willie over a single\nnight, two days after his\ndeath, in the Bardo. The\nBardo is the \u2018intermediate\u2019 or transitional state\nbetween one\u2019s death and\none\u2019s next birth, according\nto Tibetan Buddhism. Here\nWillie joins the restless\nspirits who are responsible\nfor much of the novel\u2019s\nnarration.\n\u201cOne must be constantly looking for opportunities to tell one\u2019s story,\u201d\nexplains Hans Vollman,\none of the ghosts, who\nlike the others, believes\nhimself not to be dead, but\nmerely ill, recuperating\nafter the misfortune that\nhas brought him to the\ncemetery in his \u2018sick-cart\u2019\nand makes him rest during\nthe day in his \u2018sick-box\u2019.\nThe ghosts are unsettled\nthat Willie isn\u2019t moving\nonto his next life, like the\nyoung do quickly, he\u2019s\nstuck in the Bardo, and\ngood doesn\u2019t come to\nthose spirits that tarry.\nThe novel centres\naround the legend that\ndeep in the midst of\nthe Civil War Abraham\nLincoln, driven to\nmadness by grief, visited\nthe body of his dead child\nthe night before burial. In\nthe novel, the visit by his\ngrieving father agitates\nWillie\u2019s spirit, as well as\nhis graveyard neighbours.\nHis demonstration of love\ncalls up all sorts of weird\nfeelings in the lingering\nsouls.\n\u201cIt was cheering. It gave\nus hope,\u201d a ghost called\nReverend Thomas says,\n\u201cas if one were still worthy\nof affection and respect\u201d\neven in this debased state.\nAnother ghost, Roger\nBevins III draws a similarly optimistic conclusion.\n\u201cWe were perhaps not so\nunlovable as we had come\nto believe,\u201d he says. If\nthe spirits can persuade\nthis boy to undertake his\nrightful departure to the\nOther Side, they might be\nsaved as well. It will be a\nlong night.\nThe souls of the Bardo\ncrowd around this uncanny\nchild. As the cast grows,\nso does our perspective;\nthe novel\u2019s concerns\nexpand. In the midst of the\nCivil War, saying farewell\nto one son foreshadows all\nthose impending farewells\nto sons, the hundreds of\nthousands of those who\nwill fall in the battlefields.\nLincoln in the Bardo author George Saunders // Tim Knox\n24\nBOOKS\nHenry Bennie\nBooks writer\nRandom House. 368 pp.\nLincoln in the Bardo\nby George Saunders\n\u201cAs the cast\ngrows, so\ndoes our\nperspective\u201d\n\u201cThe genius\nof Saunders\u2019\nconstruction\nbecomes\nwonderfully\napparent at\nthe climax\nand it the best\nrealisation of\nthe plot\u201d\nAs the cast continues to\nexpand, we see more and\nmore of life and out of the\nvoices of the graveyard we\ncan see a whole country.\nLincoln in the Bardo\n\u201cSaunders has\nserved up the\nperfect novel\nof the year\u201d\nwas clearly conceived\nbefore the present circum-stances, but it is nonetheless inflected with the\ntensions we can see today\nwith the rise of populism.\nSaunders has served up\nthe perfect novel of the\nyear. It is an all-encom-passing, exhausting, emotionally involving attempt\nto get up again after a fall,\nto fight for empathy and to\nresist.\nThe writer notes that\nthere is also an audiobook\nwith a cast of 166 people,\nincluding Nick Offerman,\nDavid Sedaris, Julianne\nMoore, Lena Dunham, Ben\nStiller, Susan Sarandon,\nMegan Mullally and Don\nCheadle giving voice to\nplethora of ghosts, which\nmight be an even better\nexperience than reading!\nWith the Man Booker\nPrize being announced on\n17 October, Felix Books\nwill be reviewing more\nfrom the shortlist over next\ncouple of weeks.\n\n"

    "content": "ARTS\nFRIDAY, 13TH\nOCTOBER, 2017 FELIX\n14\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nAngel enthralls at Arcola Theatre after Fringe success\nI\nn London it takes\nsomething special\nto be a stand-out\nvenue. The Arcola\nis just that: committed to\ndiversity and accessibility,\nthey stage performances\nof new and exciting plays,\noften fresh from festivals\nlike Edinburgh Fringe. Its\ncommitment to diversity\nand equality is reflected\nin its programme: over its\nlast season two thirds of\nperformances have been\nled by women and stories\ntackling issues of gender\nand equality are a key\nfeature. One such piece,\nAngel has just completed\na successful run. Angel\nis based on the story of\nRehana, a female fighter\nbelieved to have helped\ndefend the Syrian town of\nKobane from ISIS in July\n2014. Although precious\nlittle is known about the\nwoman herself, a mythology has built up around her\nand this play combines the\nsparse facts known about\nRehana with the myths\nbuilt around her as well\nas the true experiences of\nmany women in Kobane.\nThe atrocities suffered\nby women under ISIS\nhave been highlighted by\nwestern media, but less\nattention has been given\nto the women engaged in\nthe frontlines of defence.\nAngel shines a spotlight\non these women and their\nrole in the conflict.\nThis play is a one-wom-an show: actress Avital\nLvova plays Rehana as she\ntransitions from a young\ngirl aspiring to be a lawyer\nto a legendary sniper,\nbut this isn\u2019t her only\nrole. She plays Rehana\u2019s\nfather, mother, friends and\nfoes, smoothly switching\nbetween characters. In\nsome ways Angel feels\nalmost like one continuous monologue \u2013 Rehana\nis taking the audience\nthrough her story \u2013 we are\nright there with her, experiencing every moment.\nAt times the play is\nnoticeably unsubtle: early\non in the play, a young\nRehana is bullied and\nchallenged by neighbourhood boys and prevented\nfrom climbing a tree for\nbeing a girl, she is forced\nto pretend to be the wife\nof a strange man merely\nto gain passage, and, at\none point, is captured and\nsold as a slave alongside\ndozens of other women.\nIt is clear that Angel\ndoesn\u2019t just want to tell\nRehana\u2019s story: it wants\nto capture the experiences\nof the many thousand\nwomen caught in this\nbrutal conflict. Although\nsuch ambition should be\npraised, at times, it makes\nthe play feel heavy handed\n\u2013 Rehana\u2019s story feels\nalmost unreal \u2013 she faces\nchallenge after challenge,\nrunning full tilt through\nit all. In the play\u2019s short\nrunning time of one hour\nthis sometimes feels more\nthan a little overwhelming.\nOther aspects of the\nstory are much more\nnuanced: Rehana\u2019s own\ninternal conflict is portrayed beautifully \u2013 she\nis angry and desperate,\nbut also guilty and afraid.\nArguably the best portray-alofthisisinascenewhere\nshe shoots down invading\nsoldiers, narrating the\ndeath of each one: \u201cThe\nrapist with his nine-year-old sex slave? Death. The\nhomesick boy who made a\nterrible mistake? Death.\u201d\nIt is one of the many ways\nAngel acknowledges that\nthe people she is fighting\nare not demons: like any\nwar, this one is multifaceted and there are victims on\nall sides.\nThe staging is intimate.\nArcola\u2019s studio two is a\nsmall space, with Lvova\nfrequently within arm\u2019s\nreach of the audience.\nThis makes the experience\nall the more intense. The\nlow ceiling, stark lighting\nand minimal props contribute to the experience,\na clear demonstration of\njust how powerful good\nstorytelling and acting\ncan be. \u2018Good acting\u2019 may\nwell be an understatement\nwhen it comes to Lvova\u2019s\nperformance. She is re-markable; the one woman\nshow gives her no breaks\nand no one to hide behind.\nHer role is physically and\nemotionally demanding as\nshe fills the whole stage,\nswitching rapidly between\ncharacters and emotions.\nDespite all this, she keeps\nthe audience enthralled\nwith her performance,\nthere is no way you can\ntear your eyes away from\nher Rehana for the full\nduration of the play.\nIts not difficult to see\nwhy Angel was so well\nloved at Edinburgh Fringe\nin 2016, achieving a\nsold-out run and several\nawards.

And despite the\nworld being in love with\npumpkin this season \u2013 and\nby this I mean pumpkin\nspice latte \u2013 I feel like the\nonly thing that deserves\nto be mentioned is the\npumpkin pie. But let\u2019s\nface it, no one has time\nto make an absolutely\ndelicious pumpkin pie. So,\nafter some brainstorming,\nI decided that the only\nother food thing related\nto autumn that is worth\nmentioning, is game.\nYes, you\u2019ve heard me\nright! Probably most\npeople are not even\naware that autumn is\ngame\u2019s season, but I think\nyou might want to give\nsomething different a try.\nI know you haven\u2019t been\n\u2022 4 partridges\n\u2022 salt\n\u2022 pepper\n\u2022 1 tbsp olive oil\n\u2022 1 tbsp butter\n\u2022 100 ml Cognac\n\u2022 100 ml chicken stock\n\u2022 4 shallots\n\u2022 20 g Juniper berries\n\u2022 5 garlic cloves, crushed\n\u2022 thyme to taste\n\u2022 lemon juice\n\u2022 200 g baby carrots or chopped carrots \u2013 keep in mind that if you go\nfor the normal carrots, you\u2019ll need\nto cook them more\n\u2022 200 g peas \u2013 preferably not the\nfrozen kind\n\u2022 1 tbsp butter\n\u2022 1 tbsp honey\n1. Preheat the oven to 200\u00b0C and salt and pepper the birds to taste.\n2. In a pan, heat the oil and then gently fry the partridges. Remember\nto turn them from one side to another from time to time. After 5 min-utes, add the butter and continue frying them until browned. Move them\nin a roasting pan or a tray.\n3. In the frying pan, add the cognac and stir gently. Now, you should\nmake sure that it mixes with the grease and butter \u2013 that means that you\nshouldn\u2019t have burnt it. If, however, you did, you can gently scratch the\npan. Add the stock and heat on medium power until it\u2019s reduced by half.\nPour the sauce over the partridges.\n4. In the same pan, on low heat, saut\u00e9 the shallots, berries and the garlic for no more than 5 minutes. Add the thyme and then transfer to the\nroasting pan. On top, add the lemon juice \u2013 try not to pour too much,\nok? Roast for 10-15 minutes, until the meat is easy to pierce with a fork.\nAfter that, you can take it out, unless you want it to be roasted a bit\nmore \u2013 be careful, however! It can get too dry and you don\u2019t want that.\n5. For the side dish, boil the carrots and the peas for about 2-3 minutes\nin slightly salted water, then drain. In a frying pan (don\u2019t use the one\nyou used for the meat prep, unless you cleaned it), heat the butter and\nthen saut\u00e9 the veggies. Add the honey and the thyme and fry for another 5-7 minutes or until golden. Season and add a couple of spoons of\nwater. Cover, reduce the heat to low and cook for a few minutes until\neverything is nice and tender.\n6. Now you are done! You should finish it in no more than one and a\nhalf hours so, if you think about it, it\u2019s a nice easy quick recipe, isn\u2019t it?\nDon\u2019t forget to serve the juices from the roasting pan!\nin uni for long enough\nto mind eating the same\nmicrowaved food. But you\nwill at some point, and\nthen you will want something new for a change.\nSo, better save this page\nfor some inspiration.\nFOOD\nAndrada Balmez\nFood Editor\nI imagine that living in\nLondon provides us with\nanything we want, even if\nit\u2019s out of season \u2013 if we try\nhard enough to find it \u2013 but\nas students, we\u2019d prefer to\nspend less. You can totally\ndo that if you go for game\nduring its season, and you\nshould give partridge a\nchance. Now, when going\nshopping keep in mind\nthat in the UK you can\nfind both grey partridge\nand red-legged partridge.\nFor the following recipe, I\nrecommend using the first\none.\nKeep in mind that the\npartridge is a small bird\nand one will feed only\none person, but because\n\u201cMost people\naren\u2019t even\naware that\nautumn is\ngame\u2019s season\u201d\nI know you will actually\nhave a dinner with friends\n(there\u2019s no other better\nreason to serve a fancy\ndinner), I\u2019ll go with the\ningredients amounts for\n4 people \u2013 for any other\nnumber of guests, you\ncan do the maths yourself;\nafter all, you are an\nImperial student\nDon\u2019t these leaves make you crave a lovely pumpkin spice latte? // Flickr/Lali Masriera\n\n"

However,\nas the daylight gradually\nvanishes and the ground\nbecomes littered with\nshades of red and brown,\nwe must remember that\nthe end of summer is not\nall doom and gloom. It\u2019s\ntime to forget salads and\nlight lunches, and instead,\nbring on the comfort food.\nNothing says warm and\ncosy like soup. Especially\nfor those of us with dry\nthroats at the moment due\nto freshers\u2019 flu, which, for\nthe record, does not exclusively affect first years.\nThe classic Heinz tomato\nsoup is all well and good.\nBut if you want to try\nsomething a bit different\nfor a change, try swapping\nyour fancy Pret A Manger\navocado-and-something\nsandwiches for one of\ntheir soups of the day.\nThey offer a nice mixture\nof flavour combinations\nfor vegetarians, which are\nfar more interesting than\njust tomato, such as kale,\nlentil and roasted spices.\nThey also have meat\nvarieties , such as red Thai\nchicken and veg, which\nshould appeal to those that\nare so inclined and make a\nnice change to overused\ncream of chicken soup.\nOne pot dishes also\ncome to mind when I think\nof comfort food. Investing\nin a slow cooker would\nsave you lots of time. Just\nchuck all the ingredients\ninto it in the morning and\nvoila, as if by magic (but\n\u201cWe must\nremember\nthat the end of\nsummer is not\nall doom and\ngloom\u201d\nactually by super organ-isation), your delicious\ndinner is ready for you\nwhen you return home\nafter lectures. Your hall/\nflatmates will be jealous of\nyour time-saving strategy\nand likely be equally\nsurprised and confused\nby the unusually pleasant\nsmell when they stroll into\nthe kitchen. You could try\nmaking a hot pot, stew,\nor even a curry in a slow\ncooker or saucepan.\nMy favourite one pot\ndish has got to be chilli\ncon carne though. I usually\ncheat and buy a flavour\npacket from a supermarket\nrather than all the separate\nspices. Maybe one day\nI will truly commit and\nmake it all from scratch.\nBut in the meantime, I\nthink not. If you lack the\ntime or inclination to cook\nit yourself, you could\nalways opt for chilli on\nyour baked potato in the\nLibrary Caf\u00e9. Adding\ncheese is also a good\nshout if you can spare the\nextra pennies. My Old\nDutch, a fantastic pancake\nhouse with branches all\nover London, including\nKensington High Street\nand King\u2019s Road, offer\na pancake with a mini\nmountain of chilli con\ncarne on it, plus nachos\nand guacamole on the\nside \u2013 always welcome\nadditions in my opinion. I\ncan highly recommend.\nSo the take home\nmessage here is simple. If\nyou find yourself stressing about a lab report or\npanicking about leaving\nthe lecture theatre with no\nunderstanding of what just\nhappened, sit down, put\non your slippers, and eat\nsome comfort food.\nI challenge you to make one as nice as this // Flickr/Beck\nCalling all\nfoodies!\nFancy showing off your\nculinary skills by writing a\nrecipe?\nNoticed a food trend you\nwant to rave (or complain)\nabout?\nHave a talent for\nillustration or photography?\nContribute\nto the Food\nsection!\nNo experience needed, just\nan enthusiasm for good\nfood.\nFor more information and\nto get involved, email:\nfood.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n\n"

It is a love\nletter to the New York\nof old, the glamour of\nBroadway and the pain of\nreaching middle-age with\nregrets. Older, wearier,\nand dowdier the former\nWeisman girls reminisce\non beauty lost, the paths\nnot taken, the lives not\nlived. In particular the\nstory focuses on best\nfriends Phyllis and Sally\nwho have lost touch since\nthey left New York. Life\nhas taken them in different\ndirections \u2013 Sally is a\nhousewife still struggling\nwith self image, Phyllis,\nmore confident, more\nsuccessful, and outwardly\nliving the life they both\ndreamed of is battling\ndemons of her own. Buddy\nand Ben, their husbands,\nare also ruminating on\nthe past and the choices\nthat have both led them\nto troubled marriages.\nDuring the night of their\nreunion, buried flames\nreignite, and old hurts\nmust be reckoned with.\nEach character appears\non stage as a duplicate,\nthe ghosts of their former\nselves mingle with\nthe returning dancers,\nwatching their future\nunfold. Through the\nyounger incarnations of\nthe two couples we are\ngiven flashbacks to their\nyouth. At the same time\nthe ghosts are conscious\nof the future, watching\nwarily as their older, but\nno wiser selves retrace\npast mistakes. Here, Bill\nDeamer\u2019s fantastically\ndeft choreography really\ncomes into its own, the\nsequences in which the\ntwo versions of the characters dance around each\nother \u2013 sometimes mir-roring, sometimes taking\none another\u2019s place \u2013 are\nstunningly good.\nThe original, first\nstaged in 1971, gave only\nthe central four characters\npast and present versions,\nbut in the new staging\ndirector Dominic Cooke\nextends this to the entire\ncast. This proves an\ninspired choice, lending\nbuckets of pizzazz to the\nbig dance numbers \u2013 Dawn\nHope leads a wonderfully\nenergetic \u2018Who\u2019s That\nWoman?\u2019 in which the\nolder women recreate one\nof their favourite numbers,\nand as they dance, their\nyounger selves join in\nuntil the stage lights up\nin a wonderfully uplifting\ngalore of shimmies and\nheel flicks.

As\nwith \u2018The Heart Part 4\u2019\nand \u2018HUMBLE.\u2019, K-Dot\ncomes with a militant vibe,\ngoing at all other rappers\non the chorus of \u2018ELEMENT.\u2019: \u201cIf I gotta slap\na pussy ass nigga, Imma\nmake it look sexy\u201d. With\nthe line, \u201cMr. one through\nfive, that\u2019s the only logic\u201d,\nKendrick again asserts\nhis dominance over the\nrap game by effectively\nsaying \u201cfuck your top five\nMCs list, I am the list\u201d.\nHe further disregards\nhis competition when he\nsays \u201cI am legend, I feel\nlike all of y\u2019all is peasants\u201d\non the poignant \u2018FEEL.\u2019.\nKendrick\u2019s final verse on\n\u2018ELEMENT.\u2019 ends with,\n\u201cLast LP I tried to lift the\nblack artists / But it\u2019s a difference between black artists and wack artists\u201d and,\nwith these bars, one thing\nis clear: gone is the Kumbaya Kendrick from TPAB\nwith the uplifting message\nof black empowerment.\nInstead, Kung-Fu Kenny\nis coming at wack artists\u2019\nnecks and nobody is safe.\nIt could be argued that\nKendrick\u2019s conscious\nmusic requires too much\nthought, and hence isn\u2019t\nan easy listen for casual\nfans. This could explain\nhis lack of chart-topping\nhits (prior to DAMN.,\nKendrick\u2019s highest chart\nsuccess was \u2018Swimming\nPools\u2019 from GKMC,\nwhich landed at number\n17). However, Kendrick\nhas noticeably reinvented\nhis sound and moved\naway from the jazz/funk\ninfluences of his previous\nstorytelling, conceptual\nalbums. DAMN. has an\noverall more marketable,\ncommercial sound and includes radio-friendly hits\nlike the Rihanna collabo-ration, \u2018LOYALTY.\u2019, the\nsmooth ballad, \u2018LOVE.\u2019,\nand \u2018HUMBLE.\u2019,\nwhich became his first\nnumber one as lead artist.\nDAMN. is 2017\u2019s\nhighest selling album and\nits commercial success\nis proof of Kendrick\u2019s\nability to produce standalone hits as well as\nclassic albums without\nabandoning his integrity\nby relying on shallow, materialistic subject matter.\nDeep Dive into DAMN.\nWith the DAMN. tour on its way to London, revisit the album itself with Felix\u2019s resident Kendrick stan\nAndy Djaba\nMusic Editor \u201cKung-Fu\nKenny is\ncoming at wack\nartists\u2019necks\nand nobody is\nsafe!\u201d\nS\nince dropping\nb a c k - t o - b a c k\nclassics with\n2012\u2019s good kid,\nm.A.A.d city (GKMC) and\n2015\u2019s To Pimp a Butterfly\n(TPAB), Kendrick Lamar\nhas been relatively quiet\n\u2013 I would go as far as to\nsay that we\u2019ve had to put\nup with polished mediocrity in his absence. He did\nsurprise fans with Untitled\nUnmastered last year,\nbut this felt more like an\nextension of TPAB. Fans\nwere on red alert when, a\nday after teasing its release\nwith a cryptic Instagram\npost, he released \u2018The\nHeart Part 4\u2019. \u201cThe five-foot giant woke up out of\nhis sleep\u201d to declare he\u2019s\nreached \u201cthe legendary\nstatus of a hip-hop rhyme\nsaviour\u201d, denounce\nDonald Trump, and\nchallenge his contemporaries (\u201cYellin\u2019 \u2018One, two,\nthree, four, five / I am the\ngreatest rapper alive!\u2019\u201d).\nHe even sent subliminal\nshots: \u201cMy fans can\u2019t wait\nfor me to son ya punk ass\nand crush ya whole lil\u2019\nshit / I\u2019ll Big Pun ya punk\nass, you a scared lil\u2019 bitch\n/ Tip-toein\u2019 around my\nname nigga, you lame /\nAnd when I get at you\nhomie, don\u2019t you tell me\nyou was just playin\u201d. Kendrick and Drake have had\na subliminal beef since\nKendrick took shots in his\ninfamous \u2018Control\u2019 verse\nin 2013 and it\u2019s telling that\nKendrick effectively stole\nDrake\u2019s thunder by dropping this on March 23rd\n,\njust five days after Drake\nreleased More Life.\nHaving said that, it\u2019s\nmore likely that Kendrick\nwas addressing Big Sean,\nwho sneak-dissed the\n\u201csaviour of rap\u201d on his\ntrack, \u2018No More Interviews\u2019. No offence to Big\nSean but there is simply\nno comparing him to Kendrick; it\u2019s like comparing a\ncandle to the Sun.\nKendrick ended \u2018The\nHeart Part 4\u2019 by throwing\ndown the gauntlet, warning the entire rap scene,\nDAMN., his 4th\nalbum,\nwith \u2018BLOOD.\u2019 and\nwe hear a story of him\nattempting to help a blind\nwoman, only for her to\nturn around and shoot\nhim. The track ends with a\nbrief sample of Fox News\nreporters criticising his\n2015 BET awards performance of \u2018Alright\u2019, from\nTPAB. We then launch\nstraight into the explosive\nsecond track, \u2018DNA.\u2019,\nand Kendrick relentlessly\nbombards us with bar\nafter bar of pure heat.\n\u2018DNA.\u2019 is undeniably\nan album standout, and\nI\u2019m not ashamed to admit\nthat it gassed me so\nmuch on first listen that\nI was punching the air\nfor no damn reason. The\nfinal verse is particularly\nbreathtaking, with Kendrick using double-time\nflow to seemingly fit\nmore rhymes in each\nbar than sounds possible\nwithout coming up for air,\nbreathlessly showcasing\nhis pure lyrical ability.\nAhead of the final verse,\nwe hear a brief sample\nof Fox reporter Geraldo\nRivera\u2019s ludicrous claim\nthat \u201chip-hop has done\nmore damage to young\nAfrican-Americans than\nracism in recent years\u201d\nin response to Kendrick\u2019s\n2015 BET awards perfor-mance. Kendrick directly\nresponds to this criticism\non the next track, \u2018YAH.\u2019\nwhen he says, \u201cInterviews\nwanna know my thoughts\nand opinions / Fox News\nwanna use my name for\npercentage\u201d and \u201cSomebody tell Geraldo this\nnigga got some ambition\u201d.\nThrough repeatedly referencing their criticism of\nhim and hip-hop in general on the first three tracks,\nKendrick is telling Fox\nNews (and mainstream\nmedia in general) that he\nsees through their deliberate manipulation of his\nname and image, and their\nmisinterpretation of the\nDAMN. // Top Dawg Entertainment\nMUSIC\nArtist: Kendrick Lamar.\nLabel: Top Dawg //\nAftermath // Interscope.\nTop Tracks: FEAR.; DNA.;\nHUMBLE. For Fans Of: J.\nCole; ScHoolboy Q; Chance\nthe Rapper. 55 minutes\nDAMN.\n\u201cY\u2019all got \u2018til April the 7th\nto get y\u2019all shit together\u201d.\nA week later, Kendrick\nreleased outstanding visuals for the album\u2019s lead\nsingle, \u2018HUMBLE\u2019. With\nits catchy hook, Kendrick\neffectively tells Big Sean\nand the rest of his competition to humble themselves,\nall while using Sean\u2019s \u201clil\u2019\nbitch\u201d ad-lib.\nKendrick begins\nAlthough Kendrick\nhas taken a new direction\nwith DAMN., that\u2019s not\nto say that storytelling\nhas been completely\nabandoned on this album.\nIn fact, almost every track\ntells its own story. His\nstorytelling prowess particularly comes to the fore\non \u2018FEAR.\u2019 and the last\ntrack, \u2018DUCKWORTH.\u2019,\non which we hear Kendrick effortlessly float\nover three distinct beats\nwhilst recounting a tale\nabout the shocking coincidental link between his\nfather and Top Dawg, the\nhead of Kendrick\u2019s label.\nKendrick is at his most\nreflective on \u2018FEAR.\u2019,\nas he explores experiencing fear at different\nstages in his life. Each\nverse is delivered from\na different perspective,\nwith Kendrick assuming\nthe character of his strict\nmother on the first verse,\ninstilling fear of authority into a seven-year-old\nKendrick. Having grown\nup surrounded by gang\nviolence and police brutal-ity, Kendrick dedicates the\nsecond verse to his fear\nof an untimely death at\nage seventeen. In the final\n\n"

Books editor Jingjie\nCheng writes about her experience with the writer and\nhis works.\nBOOKS\nJingjie Cheng\nBooks Editor\n\u201cThe gentle,\nundulating\nflow of his\nwords always\ncarried with\nit a certain\nmelancholy\u201d\nI\nfirst encountered\nKazuo Ishiguro\u2019s\nwriting back in high\nschool, in the form of\nhis short story collection\nNocturnes. I had won\nsome book vouchers, and\nwas browsing the local\nbookstore for something\nworth buying when I came\nacross this slim volume.\nFive Stories of Music and\nNightfall, it read, against\nan austere background of\nblurred fairy lights in the\ntwilight. Curiosity piqued,\nI bought it despite having\nnever heard of Ishiguro\nbefore that, and thus\nbegan my love affair with\nIshiguro\u2019s words.\nIt was his words that\ndrew me in. The gentle,\nundulating flow of his\nwords always carried with\nit a certain melancholy, as\nif embodying the multiple\ndepths of emotion of his\ncharacters. The quiet\ncalmness of his tone does\nnot attempt to articulate\nevery level of his characters\u2019 complex internal\nworld \u2013 on the contrary,\nit respects this complexity\nby acknowledging the\ninability of words to ever\nfully capture emotional\ndepth, and thus in the\nprocess defers to its power.\nIndeed, the Swedish\nAcademy conferred the\nNobel Prize in Literature\nupon him for novels which\n\u201cuncovered the abyss\nbeneath our illusory sense\nof connection with the\nworld\u201d and were driven\nby a \u201cgreat emotional\nforce\u201d. It was this \u2018abyss\u2019\nthat I had been getting\nglimpses of across his\nbooks that I\u2019ve read, and\nthis \u2018emotional force\u2019 that\nhad moved me.\nAfter Nocturnes, I\nmoved on to his arguably\nmost famous book, The\nRemains of the Day, since\nit had won the Booker\nprize. I read it at a point in\nmy life when I was starting\nto make larger, more\nconsequential decisions,\nand Steven\u2019s struggles\nreally stood out for me,\nnot as an explicit lesson\nbut by being a bystander\nwatching his internal\ndrama as it unfolded\nbefore me.\nIshiguro\u2019s novels are\nnever the least didactic,\nunlike, say, those of\nMargaret Atwood (one of\nthe favourite speculations\nfor this year\u2019s prize whom\nI\u2019m glad did not win, but\nthat\u2019s a story for another\nday). We watch as Stevens\nstruggles to tell his story,\nrevealing information\nthen correcting himself,\nwrestling with himself\nin coming to terms with\nhis past decisions, as if\nearnestly hoping for the\nreader\u2019s assurance that his\nlife had been lived well.\nWe become anxious for\nhim, then for ourselves.\nIshiguro\u2019s novels\nexamine life incisively,\nas if we are suddenly\npresented the world\nthrough hyper-sharp\nglasses that illuminate our\nKazuo Ishiguro, back in 2005 // The Paris Review\nown internal worlds more\nclearly. Themes of loss,\nregret, ephemerality and\nthe fragility of memory\npermeate his work, and\nthe universality of these\nthemes are demonstrated\nby the various different\nsettings of his novels.\nDespite moving to\nEngland at the age of five,\nthe hometown that he\nnever knew impacted him\nenough that his first two\nnovels, An Artist of the\nFloating World and A Pale\nView of Hills, were set in\nJapan.\nAn Artist of the Floating\nWorld appeared to be the\nprecursor, a working draft\nof sorts, for The Remains\nof the Day. I read it after\nRemains, but detected a\nsimilar plotline: a narrator\nlooking back on his past,\nwrestling with past de-cisions, unreliable in his\nstorytelling because of\nparts of his life he wants\nto forget, decisions that\nhe regrets. However, their\nvery different settings\ngave each an entirely\n\u201cIshiguro\u2019s\nnovels\nexamine life\nincisively,\nas if we are\nsuddenly\npresented the\nworld through\nhyper-sharp\nglasses\u201d\nA selection of Ishiguro\u2019s work // Faber&Faber\n\n"

The\nunofficial Bottle Match\nfixture pitted two traditional Celtic sports, Shinty\nand Hurling, against one\nanother. Imperial were\nunlucky to lose 3-1 to 2-0\n(which equivalates to 10\npoints to CSM against 6\npoints to ICGAC).\nThe game involved a\nm\u00e9lange of rules from\nboth sports. Hurling, a\ntraditional Gaelic sport, is\ndescribed as an amalgamation of hockey, lacrosse,\nand golf. It is regarded as\nthe fastest and oldest field\nsport in the world and\nthe ball can travel up to\nspeeds of 120km/h. Shinty\nis a Scottish game derived\nfrom hurling with sticks\nwhich more resemble\nhockey sticks than the\nIrish \u2018hurl\u2019.\nThe first half saw the inexperienced ICGAC team\nbravely take on the Shinty\nSPORTS\nBeth Hassan\nICGAC Chair\nteam who were armed with\nsticks twice the size of our\nhurls (hurling sticks). In\nthe first minute, the Men\u2019s\nCaptain Lorc\u00e1n Cropper\nhad to leave the pitch due\nto a battered and heavily\nbleeding hand, leaving\nthe team a man down.\nDespite some excellent\nhold up play by Alex\nAboud and Beth Hassan,\nCSM managed to score 3\ngoals taking advantage of\ntheir well-rehearsed team\ntactics against Imperial\u2019s\nstill forming team.\nICGAC has, however,\nfaced worse odds and\nsurvived. The second half\nsaw a totally rejuvenated\nperformance where\nImperial came into their\nown. A solid defence consisting of Joe Allen and\nNelson Taluker, with Nick\nOon in goal saw off every\nchallenge CSM could\nthrow at them. This, along\nwith the work of mercenary Fulham hurler Paul\nMannix, whose end-to-end\npassing, tireless running\nand total dominance of\nthe midfield helped to\nensure some pride could\nbe restored. He and our\nown American Sniper,\nEoin Lyons, peppered\nthe opposition goal with\nshots, scoring a goal each.\nAfter the exciting\nmatch, a well-deserved\npint, or two, was had by\nboth teams at Wetherspoons. The occasion was\nspent reflecting on how\nthis was fast becoming a\nmajor annual fixture for\nboth clubs. The ICGAC\nChair, Beth, thanked\nCSM and all the dedicated Imperial players for\ndragging themselves out of\nFelix is recruiting!\nWe want you \u2013 yes, you! We\u2019re looking for writers, photographers, editors, illustrators,\nreporters, computer experts and grammar nerds to join our team. No experience needed\n\u2013 we\u2019ll teach you everything you need to know. If you\u2019re interested, send us an email on\nfelix@ic.ac.uk\n\u201cAfter the\nmatch, a well-deserved pint\nor two was\nenjoyed at\nWetherspoons\u201d\nbed on a Sunday morning\nfor the match. A special\nshout-out was given to\nour very own cheerleader\nand photographer Sorcha\nBegley (out-of-action due\nto injury), who captured\nsome great shots of the\naction on the day.\n\u201cAnd then he tried to tell me that football was faster than hurling!\u201d // Sorcha Begley\n\n"

Any\nbreach of these policies\nand rules is taken very\nseriously by the College\nand the Union, and disciplinary action will be\ntaken where necessary. As\na result of allegations of\nmisconduct by the ACC\nMen\u2019s Hockey and ACC\nMen\u2019s Rugby clubs, the\nUnion suspended several\ncommittee members of\nboth clubs pending investigation into the incident.\nFollowing the outcome of\nthis, action has been taken\nby both clubs.

But is\nDefenders an Avengers-style blockbuster or a Fantastic Four flop?\nTELEVISION\nSaad Ahmed\nTelevision Writer\nA\nfter two years\nand five seasons\nworth of episodes between\nthe characters, Marvel\u2019s\ndarker and grittier street\nlevel heroes finally come\ntogether Avengers-style.\nHowever, after all the\nbuild-up and a lacklustre\nperformance from Iron\nFist, the biggest question\nwas whether Defenders\nwould be able to justify all\nthe hype. Unfortunately,\nthe answer is no; sure\nit\u2019s better than Iron Fist,\nbut it\u2019s disjointed, poorly\npaced, and ultimately\nmisses an opportunity to\nbe something greater.\nThe first two episodes\ndon\u2019t do the show any\nfavours, as hardly anything\nhappens. All we see are\nthe individual characters\ngoing off on their own\npursuits, which are pretty\nvaguely connected at best.\nI\u2019m all for building things\nup , but with only eight\nepisodes, it\u2019s frustrating\nthat nothing majorly\nrelevant or interesting\nhappens until the heroes\nfinally meet at the end of\nepisode two. It doesn\u2019t\nhelp that everyone\u2019s individual stories aren\u2019t as\ninteresting or engaging as\nthey were in each of their\nindividual shows.\nThe show really kicks\ninto gear when all the\nheroes get together and\nclash against each other\u2019s\nconflicting personalities,\nwhich is the real meat\nof any crossover and\nteam-up. The chemistry\nbetween all the characters is fantastic, and it\u2019s\n\u201cThe chemistry\nbetween all the\ncharacters is\nfantastic, and\nit\u2019s fun seeing\nthem get to\nknow each\nother\u201d\n\u201cWith all the\nengaging\nmoments there\nis an equal\nnumber of\noutright dumb\nones\u201d\nfun seeing them get to\nknow each other as well\nas question each other\u2019s\nstyles and methods. One\nof my favourite moments\nis when everyone\u2019s having\ndinner and discussing\neach other\u2019s situations and\ninformation. Sometimes\nyou don\u2019t need a big battle\nwith epic proportions to\nget involved and immersed\nin a story. Frustratingly,\nthere aren\u2019t as many\ninteractions as we\u2019d like.\nDanny and Luke work\nparticularly well against\neach other and Jessica\u2019s\nsnarky personality clashes\nbrilliantly with Daredevil.\nOnce they all meet, the\nquality of the show goes\nup a few notches. We see\nall the Defenders forced\ntogether as a result of the\nHand, a criminal organisation already established\nin Daredevil and Iron Fist.\nWith the danger to their\nloved ones, they\u2019re forced\nto work together and plan\nahead against their own\nwishes. Unfortunately, the\nfinal act is less interesting,\nthanks in no small part to\nthe villains.\nThe Hand remain the\nweakest villains of all the\nNetflix series so far. They\nhave very little personality\nand, in particular, Sigourney Weaver\u2019s Alexandra\nis a very bland character,\nespecially when compared\nto the likes of the other\nNetflix villains. The intentions of the group are also\nkept very vague until the\nend where their plan turns\nout to be something a bit\nbizarre and fanatical. The\nFingers of the Hand that\nare introduced later on are\nsomewhatmoreinteresting\nbut any potential nuance\nand insight they could\u2019ve\nhad is foregone in favour\nof plot progression. At the\nend of the day, the Hand\njust weren\u2019t worth all the\nbuild up we were getting\nfrom the previous shows.\nIt\u2019s really aggravating,\nespecially when there are\nhints of better storylines\nand ideas. The return of\nElodie Yung as Elektra\nis very well-done. She\u2019s\na more credible villain\nto the Defenders and her\nconnection to Daredevil\nalready makes her more\ncompelling than Alexandra. It\u2019s this relationship\nwith Daredevil that sows\nthe seeds of disharmony\namongst the team as\nthey\u2019re struggling to unite\nin precarious circumstanc-es. Her story eventually\ngets merged with the less\ninteresting one of the\nHand which leads to an\nuninspiring and lacklustre\nfinal two episodes.\nThe action sequences\nare entertaining, though\nnot as amazing as they\ncould\u2019ve been. Highlights\ninclude a hallway fight\nwhere the characters come\ntogether for the first time\nand a Daredevil vs. Iron\nFist fight in the middle of\nthe series. The scenes with\nthe Fingers however, don\u2019t\njustify their supposed\nfighting prowess. Additionally, most of the\naction sequences don\u2019t\nreally have much weight\nto them; for the most part,\nit\u2019s the Defenders fighting\nninjas in isolated loca-tions. Without civilians\nin the potential crossfire,\nthere\u2019s no great sense of\ndesperation or tension\nwhich could\u2019ve added so\nmuch more.\nWith all the fun and\nengaging moments, there\nis an equal number of\ntroublesome and outright\ndumb moments. Danny\nis told the Hand need his\npower and he proceeds\nto use it in a very crucial\nmoment (his character is\nbetter here than in his own\nshow at least). Also Daredevil, whose entire shtick\nis heightened senses, can\u2019t\nhear someone making\nvery little effort to sneak\nup on him. Similarly,\nthe supporting cast from\nthe individual shows\ndon\u2019t have much of a\nstrong presence outside\nof Foggy\u2019s occasional\nappearances, and the few\ninteractions they have\nseem forced.\nWhile the show has\nmoments of excitement\nand fun, ultimately they\u2019re\nonly due to the brief\ncharacter interactions\nand less from a compelling plot and engaging\nvillains. While there was\npotential for the show to\nbe something great, at the\nend of the day it just felt\nhastily put together and\naverage for the most part.\nHopefully, any future\nendeavours with the team\nare more successful, more\ncohesive, and can deliver a\nmore interesting story.\nMarvel\u2019s Defenders\nSeason 1 is available on\nNetflix and any good tor-renting website.\nSome heroes don\u2019t have time for costumes // Empire\nDEFENDERS\nSEASON 1\nCreator: Douglas Petrie,\nMarco Ramirez Starring:\nCharlie Cox, Krysten Ritter,\nMike Colter, Finn Jones.\n\n"

Johnson\nqualifies this carefully in\nspeeches: \u201cGreat science\nis, of course, important in\nits own right, as well as\nyielding enormous practical benefits.\u201d His delicacy\nimplies how he thinks\nwe should view science:\nfundamental research is\nnecessary, but we should\nfocus on its practical\noutcomes.\nThis analysis could\nbe thrown off as mere\ncynicism, but with last\nweek\u2019s announcement of\nthe non-executive board of\nUKRI, the government\u2019s\nplan for research is exactly\nwhat I feared it might be.\nThe UKRI non-exec-utive board will play a\ncritical role in providing\nstrategic direction and\noversight of research\nfunding in the UK.\nMembers of the Board \u2013\nwho were appointed by\nJohnson, and will typically serve for between three\nand five years \u2013 include\na number who specialise\nin turning science into\nan industry: Mustafa\nSuleyman is co-founder\nand Head of Applied AI\nat DeepMind, where he is\nresponsible for integrating\nthe company\u2019s technology\nacross a wide range of\nGoogle products. There\nare also academics with\nlinks to big business: our\nown President Alice Gast\nis, amongst her other\nroles, a board member of\nChevron, who \u201cwork[s] to\nmeet the world\u2019s growing\ndemand for energy by exploring for oil and natural\ngas.\u201d Another important\nmember is Lord Browne,\nwho chaired the Browne\nReview which recommended the removal of\nthe student fees cap. He is\nemblematic of universities\nbecoming a business. And\nwhat would a research\nfunding council be without\nan ex-managing director\nof an investment bank, Sir\nJohn Kingman.\nThrough selecting\nthese board members the\ndirection UK research will\ntake is evident: the only\nscience worth doing is\nscience that can have an\neconomic impact. On the\nsurface this may seem like\na fairly innocuous state-ment. Indeed, why waste\ntime and spend taxpayers\u2019\nmoney doing something\nthat might not be of use to\nanyone?\nScience can take time\nto show how it can be\nuseful, and some of the\nto be no reason to believe\nthat electricity will be\nused as a practical mode\nof power.\u201d\nIs the UK\u2019s push for\nresearch to be useful in\nthe here-and-now, in an\neconomic sense, a step\nin completely the wrong\ndirection? I would heartily\nsay yes, but what\u2019s more\nunsettling is that the trend\nisn\u2019t specific to the UK.\nSpeaking at a European\nResearch Area conference\nin Berlin last year, Carlos\nMoedas, the European\nCommissioner for\nResearch, Science and\nInnovation said the next\nframework programme\nfor European research\nfunding, FP9, should have\n\u201ca more sophisticated\napproach\u201d to impact.\nHowever, it is still yet\nto be understood, what\nexactly Moedas means\nby his comments. Some\nbelieve he wants to replicate the UK\u2019s Research\nExcellence Framework,\nREF across Europe, but\nwe will only find out when\nthe FP9 is developed over\nthe next year.\nThe EU \u201cpoorly distinguishes between research\nfunding and obsolete\nforms of industrial subsidisation\u201d, wrote Peter\nStrohschneider, President\nof the DFG, a German\nresearch council. He is\nhighly critical of the UK\u2019s\nand the EU\u2019s stance on\nimpact and believes that\nresearch can only have\ntrue impact when anticipated short term benefits\nare not allowed to become\nthe main criterion for\nfunding decisions.\nI side with Strohschneider, for in my eyes the\ntruth worth of science is\nunquantifiable and beyond\nany measure of impact.\nJo Johnson, Minister for Universities, likes his science profitable // Wikimedia\n\u201cThrough\nselecting this\nboard, the\nmessage is\nevident: the\nonly science\nworth doing is\nthat which has\nan economic\nimpact\u201d\nmost remarkable discoveries have come out of\nlooking at something that\nfirst appeared pointless.\nCERN management\nthought Tim Berners-Lee\nwas wasting time with his\nuseless world wide web;\nthe Nobel-prize-winning\ncancer researcher Paul\nNurse stumbled across\na gene for cell division\nafter watching yeast, and\nin 1867, nine years after\nFaraday\u2019s death, a meeting\nof British scientists pronounced that \u201cAlthough\nwe cannot say what\nremains to be invented, we\ncan say that there seems\n\u201cExplotation of\nscience, a.k.a.\ninnovation, is\nat the heart\nof the UK\ngovernment\u2019s\neconomic\npolicy and\nindustrial\nstrategy\u201d\nof all UK funding councils\ninto one super-council: UK\nResearch and Innovation\n(UKRI). Science can no\nlonger survive as a worthwhile human endeavour\n\n"

However,\nas is always the case with\nsocial media snaps, the\nalbum is an airbrushed\nportrayal of my holiday\nand by extension of Cuba.\nMuch like Raul Castro and\nFidel before him, I make\nsure you only see the best\nbits.\nWhat we actually saw\nbeyond the hotel was\na country unchanged\nfor decades. A place so\nsteeped in nostalgia it\nnever thought to look\nforward. And amidst the\nsmiling faces there was\nthe sense that not all is\nright in paradise.\nAway from the ears\nof hotel managers, our\nguide explained to us\nhow Cold War-era rationing is still in place\nfor Cuba\u2019s residents.\nOne chicken leg per\nmonth, no beef \u2013 that\u2019s\nonly for tourists. To kill\na cow illegally results\nin the same penalty as\nmurder, the resources are\nthat scarce. He went on\nto talk about the colourful classic cars \u2013 a result\nof ancient economic\nsanctions which made\nbuying new cars virtually impossible. They\u2019re\nnot just a quirky feature,\nthey\u2019re a reminder to\nresidents of the stagnant\neconomy.\nThe next day we were\ndriven to Havana in\none of these old relics,\naccompanied by another\nmember of hotel staff \u2013\npresumably so that we\ndidn\u2019t stray too far from\nthe tourist routes. He told\nus about how wonderful\nCuba is, how awful\nEngland sounds, and\nwhy it\u2019s not so bad that\nhe can\u2019t leave the island.\nAfter a bit more probing\non this unexpected\nremark he elaborated:\napparently Cuba does\nnot permit its residents\nto leave unless they are\ngoing for business or\nanother official reason;\neven then there\u2019s no\nhelp them go on holiday,\nsee family elsewhere in\nthe world, or simply to\nescape to a new life.\nTo escape is the last\nthing most sun-worship-ing, white sand-chasing\ntourists think on arrival\nto Cuba. But as a resident\nit\u2019s easy to understand\nwhy: aside from their\nlack of freedom Cubans\nmust contend with the\ncrumbling buildings and\ninfrastructure; the state\nowned TV channels,\nthe restricted wifi and\ninternet access; old cars\nspewing out god knows\nwhat, choking up the\nstreets. Their world\nfamous health care is\nremarkable considering\nthe limited resources,\nbut even in this department there lie problems,\nwith foreigners and Raul\nCastro\u2019s inner circle\nusing one set of facilities and everybody else\nhaving to use another.\nHere you get the\nsense that the world is\npassing by and people in\nCuba are helpless to do\nanything about it. GDP\nwas down 0.9% in 2016\nand yet the communist\ngovernment still loosens\nits tight control on the\nmarkets at a snail\u2019s pace.\nOut of a population of\n11.1 million only 38.8%\nhave access to internet,\nmeaning the majority of\nthe population are out of\nthe loop with any current\naffairs not broadcast\nby biased state-owned\nmedia. As a result of such\nrestrictions Cubans are\nstuck in the 1960\u2019s, both\neconomically and psy-chologically, while the\nnothing changes.\u201d\nSome will always\nuphold Cuba as a socialist model of fairness and\nliberation from the capitalist machine. Maybe\nI\u2019m wrong in saying\nit\u2019s not. People in Cuba\nare equal, I suppose.\nEqually down-trodden,\nequally frustrated \u2013 frustrated by the poverty, the\ndecay, the stagnation.\nBut above all by their\nlack of freedom, the\nacquisition of which\nwill always outshine\nmonetary equality as a\nhuman need. After all,\nhave you ever heard of\nan inmate satisfied with\nlife behind bars because\nof uniform portion sizes\nin the canteen? I doubt\nit, even if their prison is\na tropical paradise.\nYou might like vintage cars, but what about communist rule? // Flickr/Pedro Szekely\n\u201cAmidst the\nsmiling faces\nthere was the\nsense that not\nall is right in\nthis tropical\nparadise\u201d\nrest of us surge forward\ninto the 21st century.
