Papers are up in\nthe common room.\nNUKES On the other side of the Atlantic, they\nhave tee shirts which read Nukes Puke.\nNuclear fuels and nuclear power are\ntopics which are at present very much in\nvogue and with good reason; if nuclear\ncatastrophes are averted by one hour (ie\nsixty minutes \u2014 and in seconds it sounds\neven shorter), it makes a lot of people\nvery unhappy. Three-mile Island is the\nname that comes to mind; on the same\nday that leaks of radioactive water were\ndiscovered in California, ani dependent team set up by the Nuclear Regulatory\nCommission in America produced its findings on the recent crisis in Pennsylvania\nat Three-mile Island. This revealed that the\nimmediate area was saved from a 'melt-down' of reactor fuel, and implicit in this\nserious consequences for public safety\nand health and the evacuation of thousands by one hour and one observant\nforeman at the nuclear plant. The particular\ncircumstances of this case are unlikely to\nrecur, but according to the investigating\nteam, unless fundamental changes in the\nindustry are encompassed, there is a high\nrisk of another similar accident.\nThe blame is laid at the door of management; the accident has already led\nto an extensive review of the nuclear\nindustry, but someone has to find the\nhappy medium between rushing into decisions and sitting around and hoping.\nHarking back to California with its history\nof tremors and the possible huge and\ndamaging earthquake that seismologists\nare predicting will occur in the next ten\nyears, it is essential that decisions, the\nright decisions, are taken.\nThe problems with nuclear power are\nnumerous and notorious, the clashes with\nenvironmentalists are well-documented;\ncloser to home, British Nuclear fuels\n(which is state-owned) has been sparring\nwith the Water Authority in Cumbria, accused of selfishly trying to commandeer\nwater for their nuclear fuel plant at\nWindscale, water which the Water Authority want to channel into the industrial west of Cumbria. The motion at\nour last UG Mon nuclear waste being\ntransported through London in containers\nwhich have already proved unreliable is\nanother reflection of this. But what of\nalternatives? Undoubtedly the issue will\neventually pass out of fashion; behind-the-scenes work will still go on, with the\ngeneration of new ideas and new problems. Joe Q Public, for all his concern, seldom offers constructive advice, and in the end is content to leave\nit all to the experts; is he really only after\nsomething for nothing?\nFor some unfortunate people, the sooner the matter slips into obscurity the\nbetter. They must be so weary of saying,\n\"Yes, Ido live near Three-mile Island; No,I don't glow in the dark.\"\nLars Wernberg-Maller\n2\n\n"

    "content": "SAILING CLUB\nIC vs Oxford University\nLast Saturday, Imperial College sailing team travelled lip to Oxford, ,for\nthe first away match of the year,\nhoping to complete a double over\nOxford University, who were defeated\nat the Welsh Harp in November. Conditions were light, but improved\nduring the first race, which Oxford\nwon by securing second, third and\nforth positions. In the second race, IC\nheld first, third and fourth places, but\nhaving taken two two point penalties\nfor rule infringements, the position\nwas not good enough. Some close\nracing resulted on the last leg of this\nrace, with IC pulling through to first,\nsecond and forth and so winning the\nmatch by half a point.\nTeam:John Williams( Captain), James Baxter, Kevin Andrews, Colin\nMurray, Nick Ajdarian, and Jill Butler.\nIC BILLIARDS AND SNOOKER\nCLUB\nOn Wednesday, IC 'A' team played\nL SE'A' team at home. They won 5-0.\nFirst onto the sacred altar was Christ,\noh sorry, Chris Tripp, who only won\n117-9 to the shock of the bookies who\nwere' offering odds on a147 break.\nYou can buy a Chris Tripp adoration\nmat from Mecca (but don't go armed).\nSecond on was Geoff Keymer (I'm not\nthe only one who thinks he's cuddly\nanymore, eh!). His opponent couldn't even have beaten a two-legged Tito\npuppet and Geoff won comfortably.\nThe next player was Dave Crossland\nwho was victorious even though the\nopponent was related to Adam and\nEve, who's related to Mao.\nST THOMAS' HOSPITAL1 vs IC 1: 2\u20143\n\" FOOTBALL For the first hour of this match IC\nwere content to watch St Thomas'\npass the ball amongst themselves\nprovided they didn't enter our penalty\narea, where Steve Veats would gather\nthe ball and kick it back to their centre\nhalf. Then St Thomas' scored and IC\nhad to attack.\nImmediately Ian Stevenson equalise d with a typically powerful twenty yard\ndrive. Not to be outdone, Slinky Rickard dribbled down the left wing\nand, with the defender sitting watching,\nhe crossed the ball into the goal\nnonchalantly.\nWith less than ten minutes to go IC\nonly had to hang on to the lead. Until\nKinky Kenrick let the winger trip over\nhis leg to give away a penalty. As usual Steve \" Look No Hands\" Veats\nstood no chance with the kick.\nBut like all good stories there was a happy ending, Dave Dean sporting ly allowed the defender to head the ball\nclear to the feet of Andy Haralampous\nwho didn't kick it over the bar for a change but deceived the goalkeeper\nwith the softness of his shot and scored. This time IC held firm to\ncollect two useful points.\nIC CHRISTIAN UNION ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING at 6:30pm in Union Concert Hall.\nCANOE CLUB will be showing slides\ntaken during last summer's tour of the\nAlps at 7:30pm in the I CW A Lounge.\nAnyone welcome.\nREAL ALE SOCIETY MEETING at\n7 : 3 0 pm in the Crush Bar,2n d floor,\nUnion Building.

GAY SOC INFORMAL MEETING\nWITH DISCUSSION\nTHURSDAY 7th FEBRUARY\n6:00pm SOUTHSIDE UPPER LOUNGE So next came the friendly, but\ndeadly MP for Stevenage who just\nwangled a win against not too brilliant\nopposition. Last on was aW OG( Western Oriental Gentleman) whose\nsnooker action is as nonexistent as the\ndodo. He's so brilliant he got us all\ntickets for the Benson and Hedges and\nforgot to get himself one! He won however to keep the A side poof ter s firmly entrenched at the top end of the\ntable.\nThe' B' team played RH C.Alan Leclezio won his game then did a service\nto humanity and beamed himself six feet\nunderground. The soppy, wet Steve\nJeans pons ed to the table next and\nnearly wet himself winning. (I'd just like\nto take this opportunity to say Newport\n2, Cardiff 0).\nNext came Andy Kresewski to whom\nthe steel strike has meant he can't purchase any iron curtains (if those\nRussians start a war we know\nwho to blame). Just for the Kremlin's records, he lost. So the formidable\nChris Calvert entered the scene handcuffed to his rucksack (looks like\nhe could do with a dose of terminal\nanorexia nervosa) or am I on about\nSimon Bennett? CC won and last on\nwas the Orson Welles of IC, Simon\nBennett, who lost.\nThe' C team were at home to\nCharing Cross. First on was D Nuttall\nwho wasn't particularly P Merryment.\nThe way he tried to rally support was\nreally effective as having a bath with'\nsix other blok es and singing / Feel\nFine in Japan. So the insignificant yet\npathetic Nuttall lost in superb style.\nSecond on was that miserable, oh so\nmiserable specimen of sociability Alex\nCameron (I still haven't worked out his\nteeth equation). Fending off waves of\nsheer happiness he blasted his opponent from here to the Khyber\nPass. I, myself and me played next\nand what can you say. More exciting\nthan the last supper, more devastating\nthan a kebab and more nail biting than\nthe rocket scene in Life Of Brian. Well\nI don't like to beat about the point too\nmuch since modesty is my main asset\n(and also I come from Newport) but I won. So on came Damian Kelly. The crowd could hardly contain themselves,\nbut nevertheless he lost his second\ngame in a row. Last on was Graham\nCurtis, who lost.\nThe draws have been made for the\nOpen and Handicap Snooker Tournament and games must be played by\nthe end of the first week in February.\nLessons are still available and can be\narranged for anyone interested.\nGareth Machin\n11\n\n"

    "content": "Saffron has appeared on TV and Radio in many places. These appearances include\n'About Anglia' (Anglia TV); ' Look West' (Harlech TV); 'Pebble Mill at One'\n(BBC Birmingham TV); John Peel's 'In Concert', 'My Kind of Folk',' Country Meets Folk', \"12 Noon Show', ' Bob Harris Show', 'Alan Freeman Show' (all BBC\nradio); 'Show of the North' (BBC\u00a3cot land radio). She has done TV and radio in\nHolland, Belgium and France and appeared in a showcase half-hour spot on\nWBAI-Radio, New York.\n\"It's quite an experience to accompany Saffron to a folk club where perhaps some\nof the people might have only vaguely heard of her, and then watch the effect on\npeople when she sings. It really is startling, the transition from mild curiosity into\ncomplete absorption and enjoyment. Then listen to the various comments afterwards,\nranging from 'Who is she?' to 'Where has she sprung from?' interspersed with such\nthings as ' Good g awd!' and 'Blimey!'. Next Monday in Lower Refectory\nFolk Club present\nSaffron Summerfield\nI wish I could think of something\nlight-hearted and jovial to say about\nthis album.1 would really like to\nbreeze through it and amuse you in\nthe process, but it cannot be done.\nI admit freely to not understanding\nall of it, but I know one thing for\nsure, a barrel of laughs it is not.\nThe Wall by Pink Floyd has\nbeen nearly three years in the\nmaking and is almost entirely\nRoger Waters1\nbaby. The other\nmembers hardly feature and of\nthem only Dave Gilmour is even\ncredited on the sleeve, as he co-wrote three or four tracks and\nassisted in the production.\nThe members of the group have\nfled this Isle (for tax reasons) so\nfast that no one got a chance to\nask them what it all means, which is unfortunate because it is by no\nmeans self-explanatory, in fact it is\ndownright obscure in places, but\nwhat follows will be, I hope, a very\ncondensed analysis.\nThe Wall is that which we build\naround ourselves, with help\nfrom parents, teachers and\nspouses, to protect ourselves\nfrom emotional hurt. As everyone\nknows, however, a wall can keep\nthings out but also keeps things\nin, so the wall becomes a cell in\nwhich we are isolated from\nothers. This happens to the\nhero of the a lub m, which is, by\nthe way, also a story. Just for\nsubtlety's sake we'll call him\nFloyd.\nIn his childhood Floyd is subjected\nto the normal traumas, he goes to\nschool and is bullied by his schoolmaster. His father leaves and\nhe feels rejected and when he goes\nto his mother for advice she helps\nhim build the Wall. He grows up,\ndiscovers sex and marries a woman he eventually ceases to\nlove. His violent outbursts against\nhis property and her, force her to\nleave him, and in one of the powerful moments on the album he\nsings that he doesn't need her, or\nanyone or anything at all anyway.\nHis view is that \"it was all just\nbricks in the wall\", which, of\ncourse, it was.\nPINK FLOYD THE WALL or A VERY SERIOUS BUSINESS\nOn the second record we find\nFloyd has become a rock star,\nbut still cannot make human\ncontact. After a few seemingly\nirrelevant songs he is made to\ngo on stage against his wishes,\nand finds himself part of a neo-fascist group, and the audience\nchants of \"Pink Floyd, Pink\nFloyd\" sound unnerving ly like\nthe Nuremberg Rally. Floyd\nrebels against all of this and is\neventually put on trial, where\nhis schoolteacher, wife and\nmother add their damning\ntestimonies that he \"showed\nfeelings of an almost human\nnature\". The judge sentences\nhim to be \"exposed before his\npeers\", his wall is torn down by\nan enormous raging mob and\nfinally, as the dust settles in the\naftermath, we see a faint glimmer\nof light at the end of a very dark\ntunnel, a hint that there may still\nbe hope.\nThat, anyway is the story.\nMusically, a Pink Floyd album can\nonly really be compared to other\nPink Floyd albums, and in my\nopinion this one could have been\nas good as Animals if only Waters\nhad been kept on a tighter rein by\nthe others in the group. If the\nunnecessary stuff had been cut\nout and the good condensed into\njust one record, the story would\nhave made more sense and the\nwhole could have been a really\ncoherent work. Tracks like Hey\nYou, my absolute favourite of\nfavour ties in which Floyd is cry ng out for someone to help him\nbreak the wall, deserve better\nthan to be hidden away where\nthey are.\nComfortably Numb and Run Like\nHell are two of the tracks which Dave Gilmour co-wrote and stand out even\nafter only one or two hearings.\nEngineered to sound like a live\nrecording, Run owes a lot to Sheep\nfrom Animals as far as the singing\nand guitar playing go, while the lyrics\nare pure paranoia. \" As the hammers batter down your door/ You' d better\nrun.\" by Leigh Foster\nI must just mention the sleeve\nwhich is a brilliant gate fold by\nGerald Scarfe. The outside\nshows an anonymous wall but\ninside through holes we can see\nthe final sentence being executed\nin a stadium that could swallow a hundred Wembleys. Ranks of\ngoose-stepping hammers parade\npast and the hideous characters\nof mother, wife and, still in an\na pople tic rage, the schoolteacher\nlook on as the appropriately\nfeatured Judge presides.\nYou may think I have said a lot here,\nor you may think I have just written a lot of words, but either way there is\nstill a lot I haven't said. I haven't mentioned the fantastic pieces of\nacoustic guitar that might move a less\ncynical being to emotion. I have only\nskimmed very lightly over the surface\nof the story, so if you want to buy the\na blum, there remains much more for\nyou to discover yourself. Personally it\nis too expensive but I might buy a record Music From The Wall if\nanyone can persuade them to release\nit. Maybe I 'll write to them myself,\nnow where was it they went to . . . ?\n\"ALL i aT4 cl1 HiI^ VITe$> TD j TH g\" ME*R. VISS1AK) K& HI 5 f0 K>6M A \u00bbv) CsO \u2014\n\n"

What is it\nall about?\nProvidence (Row) Nightshelter and Refuge\nis a large, rambling building in Crispin Street,\nE1, built by a local priest in 1860 to provide\nmuch needed succ our to the poor and\nhomeless of Victorian London. Readers of\nDickens' novels will understand something of\nthe sould destroying conditions of poverty,\nhunger and homelessness that he set out to\nimprove. It would be nice to think that now,\nafter one hundred and twenty years, Providence Row\"s work is complete, but\nsadly, this is not so. Various estimates\nranging up to 20,000 have been made of the\nnumber of homeless currently on London's streets. That's right, at this moment there may\nbe 20,000 men and women within twenty\nmiles of here with nowhere to live and nothing\nto keep them warm and dry save an old\ncornflakes box and yesterday's Evening\nStandard. Providence Row provides meals\nand beds for up to seventy-five such people\neach night. More importantly, the workers\nthere interview each person admitted to\ndetermine the cause of his (or her)\nhomelessness. Once that is known, steps can\nbe taken to remedy it.\nYou may be aware that, when signing on for\nthe dole or social security, one has to give an\naddress. Without an address it is almost\nimpossible to get any money. Without money\nit is generally impossible to find anywhere to\nlive. Providence Row breaks this vicious\ncircle by providing an address from which\nresidents can \"sign on\". This is a crucial first\nstep to rehabilitation. The next step is to try to\nfind the root cause of homelessness; this may\nvary from the demon drink through a whole\nrange of broken family problems to mental\ndisorders. By providing support for each\nindividual, backed by profesional help from\ninternal and outside social services, Providence Row aims to return him (her) to a normal life within one or two months of\nadmittance.\nHow can we help?\nProvidence Row is entirely supported by\nvoluntary donations. No money is demanded\nfrom residents on entry (although once\n\"signed on\", the social security department\npays something towards accommodation\ncosts). At present five full-time workers and\none administrator are employed and most of\nthe day to day running of the Refuge is\ncarried out by the Sisters of Mercy.\nThe Joint Chaplaincies of West London\nUniversity have adopted Providence Row as\nthe subject of their Charity Appeal 1979-80.\nAs well as fund raising we are organising\nvolunteers to go to work at Providence Row.\nUsually this means helping with serving\nmeals and talking to residents (it can mean a lot to a person who is really down on his luck\nto feel that someone else cares and is willing\nto listen). We would like to hear from anyone\nwho could go regularly, say once a week or\nfortnight, to help for an evening between\nabout 5:30 and 9:00 or 10:00pm. We are also organising a sponsored walk\non 8th March. A similar event last year raised\n\u00a33,000. With your help we could do even\nbetter this year. The walk will take place in\nlovely country near Guildford, Surrey and\neach year proves to be an excellent opportunity to meet new faces as well as\nrenewing old acquaintances.\nIf you would like more details of how you\ncould help Providence Row, please contact\nRobert Hodgson, Civ Eng PG or Carla\nMarchetti at More House, 53 Cromwell Road\n(01-584-2040).\n5\n\n"

So who needs a society to help\nthem do it? Well, firstly, it might help\nsome of you out there realise that there is\nmore to drinking coffee than pouring hot\nwater over your Nescore. Basically, it's function will be similar to that of the Wine Tasting Society, trying out different blends of coffee, secondly, I hope that the\ninformal atmosphere of normal coffee-drinking can be maintained, probably taking place in members rooms, if\nnumbers permit, encouraging people from\nall over College, especially those in 'digs'\nwho don't seem to involve themselves in\nthe more organised 'Ents'.\nSo what's so great about coffee? You may not think there is much to it, but this\nsociety will set out to prove otherwise,\nallow me to explain. Instant coffee takes\nthe beans from the coffee bush, roasts\nthem fairly lightly, grinds them, brews the\npowder so produced, and then dries the\nbrew either by boiling the water away, or\nfreeze dried. This process produces the\npowder familiar to most of us, leaving all\nthe sediment behind, which can be turned\nback into coffee with hot (not boiling)\nwater thus leaving no sediment in the\ncup. Freeze drying is better, but both\nprocesses lose much of the flavour and\naroma. If you smell a cup of instant\ncoffee, you will probably merely smell the\nwarm milk.\nThe surprising thing is that with very\nlittle extra effort, or money, you can\nmake a far better cup of co ffe. If you use\nthe ground bean, instead of the dried\nbrew, and brew it yourself, the resulting\ncup will actually taste and smell like\ncoffee. The problem of sediment can be\novercome in a number of ways. Either\nfilter the brew, using a funnel and paper,\npercolate it, or use coffee bags. Coffee\nbags tend to be expensive, and percolation\ngives the coffee a taste you either like or\nhate, personally I hate it, so I tend to use\na 'Melita' funnel and papers, which are\navailable in most department stores.\nOne other problem with real coffee is\nthat it does not keep, about seven to ten\ndays for ground coffee, and two weeks if\nyou buy the roasted bean, and grind it\nyourself, after this the coffee begins to\nlose its aroma and flavour, so obviously\nbuy a little coffee, often.\nSupply is no problem. Most supermarkets sell the Lyons brands, but for\nfreshly ground coffee, the best source is\nFern's,27 Rathbone Place which is just\noff the Tottenham Court Road end of\nOxford Street, who do a whole range of\nblends and roasts (as well as many types\nof tea). To really enjoy a cup of coffee, it\nshould be drunk black, without sugar, this\nisn't snobbish, just plain good sense. After\nall, how can you taste the coffee if all you can tast is the milk and sugar? If you\nreally can't do without them, real coffee is\nstill worthwhile. Real coffee is much stronger than instant and thus is very\nuseful if you have to burn the midnight oil\n( about one cup per hour is usually enough to keep you awake). However, strong coffee is addictive (I get blinding\nICU SELL YACHT\nAt the ACC General Meeting last\nTuesday, the decision was taken to ask\nICU to sell the College yacht, Impetus,\nsince the boat has proved to be a constant drain on Union funds and has\nbeen of very little use to the Yacht Club mer r to ers. Since being bought in 1977, the boat\nhas suffered from severe problems arising\nfrom faults in the manufacture of the hull,\nwhich have resulted in Impetus being\nunsafe and therefore unusable.\nThe final straw came when, after losing\nher rudder in heavy seas in August, the\nboat was dried out and allowed to stand\non her keel, (a normal enough procedure)\nand the keel nearly came through the\nbottom.\nThe insurers have ruled that the damage so caused was due to a fault in\nthe building of the keel supports and\nMichael Arthur is at present trying to\nobtain the money for necessary repairs\nfrom Coral Marine, who supplied the\nyacht new to the Union. After it became obvious that Impetus\nwould not sail again this year, the Yacht Club has decided to switch its activities\nand charter yachts instead.\nA J Pearce\nCapt ICY U headaches if I stop drinking the stuff) but\nsince no one has ever found any side\neffects, that isn't going to stop me!\nIf you've read this far, you must be\ninterested in c coffee, so let me tell you a little bit about the stuff. Most coffee is a blend of coffees from different parts of\nthe world. Here are the main types. They\nfall into two main types, Arabica, which\ngives the coffee its main taste, and Robusta, which keeps the cost down and\ntakes away the bitterness of some of the\nstronger types. Main types of Arabica are:\nKenyan, Costa Rica, Mocha, Santos, Columbian, and Indian.\nA popular blend is ' Mount ian Blend'\nwhich is a mixture of central American coffees, but the number of blends is\nvirtually limitless. Also the flavour depends on the roast, from light, which\nproduces a very mild cup to a 'continental\nroast which produces a strong cup, but\ntends to mask some of the subtler flavours.\nSo this is where Coffsoc comes in.\nEvery meeting, if possible we'll try a different blend or roast, and allow members to make up their own minds as\nto what they like. I sincerely hope there\nwill be no snobbishness in this society, if\nafter going to some of our meetings, you still prefer instant, with milk and sugar,\nthat's fine. How do you join? Just contact\nany of the below, <and we'll see if there is\nenough interest to get going (you might\neven get a free cup of coffee, if you ask\nnicely).\nLee Pad don Beit 121\nJonathan Brigs Beit 3\nRobert Yates Beit 91\n\n"

Firstly, the coveted front page\nfeature was devoted to 'Life On A Grant', and was mainly concerned with new information\nnot even brought up at the\nmeeting.\nThen inside we were treated\nto not one, but two anonymous\npersons views on the meeting,\nboth mainly concerned with\nsarcastic comments about apathy and general bitching at\nthe Exec.\nIam fortunate in that, having\nattended the meeting myself, I know what went on, but I'm sure if I hadn'tI would have\nbeen very confused and probably much put off by the\ntrivial is ation of most of what\nwent on. With reports like\nthese is it surprising that UG Ms are \"attended by the\nslightly confused faithful few\"\nto quote the first anonymous\nauthor( or should I say authoress as I expect it was aMs), or that \"those that attend\nhave become hardened to the\nidea that they are just talking\nshops\" to quote the second.\nSurely it would be better to\nhave an official report by a FELIX news reporter, giving\nthe facts, ie what actually went\non, in the most clear, concise\nand preferably unbiased manner possible, and leave the\nMr( Ms)X s to air their personal views on the letters'\npage \u2014 they might even have\nthe courtesy to put their names\nto it there.\nRachel Snee\nEds Comment\nThe UGM report was\nwritten by our News Editor.\nThe 'Not A UGM Report' is\ntraditionally written by our\n'Internal Affairs Correspondent'.\nThe names of the students\nwho hold these positions on\nthe newspaper, have been\npublished in FELIX this term.\nThe front page included\ninterviews with student\nrepresentatives from both sides\nof the grants argument and\nends with an overall comment\nfrom the NUS President.\nDear Colin\nI should like to explain my\nopposition of the grants motion\nat the last U GM as I do not\nfeel it was adequately summarised in FELIX last week. The\npoint I was making was that, as\nwe are frequently reminded the\nmoney which the Government\nspends has to come from somewhere. In asking for an\nincrease in grants and, in the\nsame breath, advocating no\ncuts to the education budget,\nwe are demanding money on\ntwo accounts which does not\ngive the appearance of an awareness of the situation. There must be some give and\ntake on both sides and, although\nI was being idealistic in suggesting students could possibly\naccept a short term decrease\nin grants, I do believe that the\nfull grant, as it is now, is\nperfectly adequate for a student\nto live on and I do not think it is a matter of going without luxuries\n\u2014 who else at our age can afford\nto drink in the bar every night or\ngo out to theatres\u2014concerts\u2014\ncinemas\u2014night clubs several\ntimes a week?\nIn demanding more money\nfor students you are removing\nany credibility that the cuts\ncampaign has established in\nthat our criticisms are no longer constructive. I was appalled to read that the only\nresolution that came out of the\nrecent NUS conference was to\ndemand a36% increase in student grants and that there\nwas no decision made to\nactively and constructively fight\nthe cuts. I would be bitterly\ndisappointed to see ICU adopt\nadopt the same approach.\nYours sincerely\nJo Armitage\nDear Sir\nWhat is a Union Hack? At the last Union Council meeting that question was asked (and never answered)\nwhen it was proposed that\nattempts should be made to\ninvolve non hacks in. Union af far is.\" We need to have ordinary\nstudents on our Union committees to represent the views of\nthe ordinary students.\"\nWhat is an ordinary student?\nA non-hack.\nSomebody who gets involved\nin the Union and sits on committees.\nCatch22. You can't have\nordinary students on committees to represent the views of\nordinary students.\nPeople call me a hack. DoI take it as a compliment or an\ninsult? Even if I take it as a compliment, was it meant as an\ninsult? And if it is an insult,\nwhat is wrong with getting\ninvolved in the Union?\nWould an ordinary student\nplease answer these questions?\nBut I 've fallen into the trap too.\nIf an ordinary student writes a letter to FELIX answering me,\nhe or she is getting involved in\nUnion affairs and must therefore\nbe a hack.\nYours questioningly\nGary Nichols\nAcademic Affairs Officer\n(and hack?)\nImperial College\nf) foes eS octet QI L Chinese New Year :_\n\\ .1 rie i\\S how: Chi11 est Dinner& Disco On SATURDAY l6 th Feb\n5: .t nll ll l3:iM,, ll lla,, Till ii pin Viiri el v Slum : (Jretil Hull Dinner : M.i in Dining I hi 11\nDiseo : Junior Common Itooin\nSlier T irl cl Ituililiiifj\nPrince C HIM IN Itouri Ml7 Til be : Sni if li Kensington lil is: Allie nll. ill UL member ICC STick el: \u00a34.oo Member: \u00a33..,o AVAILABLE FROM UNION4 "

Amongst the many computers on show was the newly released Sinclair ZX80 personal computer, which was described to the Club by Clive Sinclair,\nthe founder of Sinclair Research. At under \u00a3100, this powerful machine brings\npersonal computing within the range of\nmost students. Also on display, although\nin a much higher price bracket, was the\nDAI personal computer, shown to the\nClub by its designer. Much in evidence at\nthis years show where high resolution\ncolour graphics facilities for various machines. There were also one machine\non display playing Chess, and moving the\npieces itself by means of a small crane.\nWe were surprised to find that one firm\nat the show, SIR A, was made up almost\nentirely from ex-IC students. We hope to\narrange a talk from a member of SIR As design team later in the year.\nIf you would like to find out more about\nMicros, why not come along to one of\nour informal club meetings( every Tuesday, 7:30pm in the Green Committee\nRoom, top floor IC Union Building), or\ncontact one of the people below via UG letter racks.\nS Jamieson, Physics 2\nJ Bambridge, Maths2 A Sauter, Elec Eng1 POST GRADUATE\nCOURSE IN THE SUN\nThe need for a better understanding of\nconstruction materials by civil engineering\ngraduates is to be met by the Harry Stanger\n[ Laboratories, who have agreed to run a series\nj of two-week courses on materials technology\n\u2022 at their training college in Malta, starting in\n\\ March 1980.\nAs the foremost materials testing, investigating\n* and consulting laboratory specialising in the\nbuilding and construction industry, Stangers\noriginally set up the training college in Malta to\nmeet the need of emerging countries in Africa,\nthe Middle East and Asia for qualified materials\ntechnologists and engineers. At the suggestion\nof some UK universities and several of the\nlarger construction companies, the extensive\nfacilities and specialist staff at Malta are to be\nmade available to British students in a series of\ntwo-week postgraduate courses in practical\nmaterials technology.\nIn view of tightening legislation on liability for\ndefects and failure to comply with legal or\ncontractual specifications and the general\nproliferation of new building materials and\nmethods, it is felt that there is now a need for\nstudents to gain practical experience of\nlaboratory and site testing before embarking on\ntheir career.\nMINES Last Sunday saw the RS M Rugby Sevens. The Batmobiles ( Met3) led by\nRich Walmsley won the final by 30-12.\nEveryone, even me, had a storm of a time\nand congratulations to Dave Rhodes who put a lot of work into organising the\ncompetition for making it such a great\nday out.\nOn Tuesday a contingent of Miners( wearing suits!) visited the London Metal\nExchange. Privileged to watch from the\nfloor, they watched the world prices of\ncopper, tin, lead, zinc, silver, aluminium\nand nickel being determined in the five\nminute dealing sessions towards the end\nof which the dealers tend to become a trifle emotional!\nOn Monday at 6:00pm in the M LT there will be aMin and Met Soc lecture\nentitled Industrial Relations by Joe Gormley.\nThe following day, Tuesday5 th February, is the Pre Camborne RS M Union General Meeting which should start around 12:30pm. Please come along\nfor the rugby captains address and watch\nthe Union officers make a cock-up of\ntheir reports.\nThe annual Chaps Indoor Fete is on Friday 8th February in Stan's Real Ale Bar from 6:00pm till late. There will be\nsome pretty unusual games with amusing\nprizes. Try and come along, if only for a short while and bring some friends with\nyou.\nThe R SMU are holding a Curry Supper\non Tuesday 12th February for all second\nyear students. Details will be forthcoming\nvery soon. Also on the 12th is aGen Com m in the Geology Conference Room. Some important issues were discussed at\nthe last one, so if you are on the committee, turn up! If you just want to\nCITY AND GUILDS Last Friday was the Guilds Dinner and Dance \u2014 the best night of the year.\nEverybody who attended had a good\ntime. I know I did.\nForthcoming events include Inter C CU Monopoly on Saturday 2nd February in\nthe IC Union Office at 9:30am. You will\nhave togo round the places on the monopoly board answering clues and collected money. There will be a time\nlimit for answering the clues and points\ntowards a prize will be given for correct\nanswers. Transport is no problem as Rag will pay for a Red Bus Rover. Come along\nand collect for Guilds.\nOn Thursday7 th February is the\nGuilds Interdepartmental Pedal Car Race\nin Princes Gardens at lunchtime.

In\nthis game the rugby teams play for the\ntwo foot high tin bottle which was given\nby Whitbread in 1 9 1 1 . It is kept on display behind the Union bar. It seems\nthat tickets for the weekend are all sold,\nbut still keep your ears pinned back for\nany spares.\nSee you at the UG Mon Tuesday,\nBob the Slob\nThe cost of the course is \u00a3200 and the\nCollege can arrange accommodation for\nfourteen days ranging from \u00a381 in self-catering\nflats to \u00a3154 in local hotels. The fee includes\ntemporary membership of the the local sports\nand social club (from sailing, diving, para-kiting\nand riding to folk dancing and discos) and free\ntransport from the media val town of Vittoriosa\nto the Old Armoury, where the college is\nhoused.\nReturn charter flights (Gatwick \u2014 Luga) can\nbe arranged through Stangers, but arrangements\nare also being made for future courses for a four-week overland package, taking small mixed\ngroups 'on safari' down and back through France\nand Italy.\nIndications are that many of the students will be\nsponsored by construction companies who are\nfinding the cost a worthwhile investment to give\ntheir graduate intake a sound practical grounding.\nFull details and application forms are available\nfrom Mr EF Lewis at Harry Stanger Ltd, Fortune\nLane, Elstree, Herts, WD63 QR( tele 01-207-3191).\n3\n\n"

We're off the ground, on Sunday\n20th February after immense hassle the\nfirst flight of the club's glider was achieved.\nHaving bought a Vortex hang-glider at the\nend of last term four of us set out for\nsunny Brighton to have it test flown and to\nhave a go ourselves. We arrived at a site\nknown as Mill Hill to find no gliding in\nprogress due to lack of wind, so we moved\non to Steyning Boul. Here we met up with\nGraham Slater who this year won the\nindividual trophy in the American Cup (an\ninternational competition, possibly the top ,\ncompetition of the year in HG terms).\nGraham then decided that Mill Hill would\nbe a better site to fly due to the wind speed\nrising a little.\nReturning to Mill Hill, we rigged the\nglider and as the wind was now strong\nenough Graham took off. After a short\nflight he OK'ed the glider and it was our\nturn!\nHowever disaster attempted to strike: as\nwe were preparing for flight the glider\ndecided to have a go on its own and\ncartwheeled off the top of the hill, over a barbed wire fence, a road and finally\nanother fence before stopping, fortunately\nundamaged.\nBack on the hill top we found that the\nharness we had was too long, however our\nSafety Officer, Dave Roberts decided to\nhave a go and promptly piled in on take off\nhaving decided to fly prone (lying down) in\na seated harness! Nice one Dave.\nOur resident expert, Tore Christianson\ntook off next in nil wind for a superb\nICHGC first flight. The day finished with\nsome ground runs to get the feel of the kite\nby me and Al Dempsey our President, who\nattempted a run with his helmet on the\nwrong way round! (he is half Irish!). All in\nall an interesting first flying outing for the\nclub, hopefully to be followed by many\nmore.\nChris Golding\nSORRY FOLKS!\nYour hard-working Ents Committee have been let down by another band:\nGallagher and Lyle have dropped out of\ntheir tour, so their concert here\non 17th February has been canceled.\nWe apologise for any inconvenience.\nPHOTSOC\nThere will be a Print Competition on Tuesday\n5th February, at 7:00pm in RSM 303.

Free professional coaching (AFA Club Coach),\ngood competition and your chance to fence for\nthe University of London.\nPRODUCTION\nCAR TRIAL\nOn Sunday 10th February, City and\nGuilds Motor Club will be holding a production car trial in a disused chalk pit.\nThere will be about a dozen tests in all, of\ntwo types. The majority will be distance hill\nclimbs which tests how far up a steep,\nloose surface a competitor can drive\nwithout touching the canes marking the\ncourse. There will also be auto tests, which\nare timed tests of a driver's skill in\nnegotiating a tight course round bol lards and include reversing.\nThere is very little risk of damage to\ncompeting cars because there is almost\nnothing to hit or roll over at the chalk pit.\nIn addition, the loose surface minimise s tyre and transmission wear on the\nauto tests, where competitors may use\nhand brake turns, etc, in their man oe uv ring. There is also plenty of opportunity for a bit\nof freelance sideways motoring between\nthe tests, so it's a good opportunity to learn\nskid and spin control safely.\nIf you are interested, have a look at the\npictures of last term's PCT on the motor\nclub noticeboard on level three of Mech\nEng or have a word with any motor club\ncommittee member in Guilds' Union Office.\nWe will need marshals, as well as competitors\nso come along even if you don't have a car.\nThe entry fee will probably be three\npounds per competitor.\nNick Fell\nPublicity Officer C& GMC\nFOR SALE GLASTONBURY FAY RE(1971).
