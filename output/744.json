    "content": "Mephisto\nThe extraordinary thing\nabout Mephisto is that, no\nmatter how many\nproductions I attend, I can\nnever remember having\nseen it before. Bill\nAlexander's production is\nparticularly forgettable.\nMephisto is the story of an\nactor in Hitler's Germany,\nstruggling for rec ogni it on and respect in Berlin,\nagainst his liberal and\nrevolutionary beliefs. This\"\nproduction, however, does\nlittle to highlight his\npredicament, but shifts the\nemphasis of the,play\ntowards surrounding\nevents. The result is that\nwhilst the play movingly\ndocuments the demise of\nrevolutionary Theatre In the\n\"years preceding the\nSecond World War, the\ncent ra) parallels between\nMarlowe's tragedy, Fault in\nas ou less country under\ndictatorial rule, and the 1\n\\)\nreversed roles of the actor\non stage and in real life are\nsadly upstaged by ag it prop tomfoolery. Cllve Merrison\nprovides some excellent -performances and the cast\ncoped well with a diminished set, but this\nfragmented production, has\nlittle to offer save a tired / \\\nambience. John Burg e88 The Golden Oriole\nThe Golden Oriole by HE Bates is a beautiful and\nenchanting book of five\nlove stories, each in its own\nway extraordinary. The\npeople are described as\n'unremarkable' in the blurb,\nbut every central character\nin this quintet is an oddball.\nThere is the man whose\ntrue love is a Rhode Island\nRed Hen, Georgina; who\nroosts in the front room\nharmonium. Fed on\nwhiskey with coffee beans\nand cream mash, the hen is\neventually ousted by an\nequally hen nish widow\nfrom across the road.\nIf you think that's normal,\nthere is always the woman\nwho hides from her\nhusband every night when\nhe comes home from the\noffice, waiting to be found\nby him, and yet he has\nnever seen her naked. Then\nthere is 'The Quiet Girl', a seamstress, who almost\nthrough her quietness and\nlassitude gets a lover, then\ngoes out and gets another,\nbefore the third, and most\ndisturbing, man in her life\narrives.\nThe other two stories\nboth involve young men,\nthe first seeking freedom\nfrom the memory of his\nfather's death. The other, a philosophy student from\nOxford, hitches a ride from\na parasitic lorry driver, who\nseems to have\nunderstanding relationships\nwith most of the women\nwho live alongside the A4.\nAll these stories\nemphasise how much\nhuman activity is a blind\ndelving for love of any kind.\nThey are truly exquisite\nstories, with tone, rhythm,\ndetail and character, and\nyet sad, as the mortal love\nthese people have is only\ntransitory and it is\nfrequently wrenched from\nthem. Well worth the \u00a31.95\nprice as the stories are so\nbountiful they are always\ngood for a reread. This is\npublished by Penguin and\navailable from most good\nsized bookshops.if Finally, if\nyou hadn't noticed, it's the\n2nd International Feminist\nBook Fortnight, so scan\nTime Out, City Limits and\nLAM for details of feminist\nactivities.\nSarah Kirk\nPOLICEPolice, a French\nfilm,stars the ubiquitous\nGerard Depardieu as\nInspector Mangin\ninvestigating a drug ring. In\nthe course of his daily\nduties he becomes involved\nwith the girlfriend of the\nchief suspect and manages\nto convince himself, against\nall the evidence, that she is\ninnocent. Too late he\ndiscovers that she is a compulsive liar. From the\nopening claustrophobic\ninterrogation scene the\naudience is thrown into a bumper car ride through\nexotic characters. The\nacting throughout is\nremarkable, young Sophie\nMerleau is brilliant. The\nuse of improvisation by\nMaurice Pialat, the director\nresults in a plot that feels\nas if it is of secondary\nimportance. However, this\ntechnique allows for some\nvery moving performances,\nand Police is a good film\nand well worth seeing.\nNow we get on to the\nbriefly s. Compromising\nPositions is a comedy and\nwith a name like that I was\nexpecting pretty dreadful\nthings from it especially\nwhen I discovered that the\nstory concerns the murder\nof a flirtatious dentist.\nHowever, it is slowly\nrevealed that the dentist is\nhaving affairs with virtually\nevery patient and further\nthat he is involved with\npornography. This was not\na great film but I found it\nquite fresh and pretty fun,\nand I think I particularly\nenjoyed this film because it\ngave all the good lines to\nwomen, unusual for a Hollywood film. Static,\n(Cannon Chelsea, Electric\nScreen) is a very\nentertaining but odd film\nabout a person who invents\na 'television' that shows\nheaven. It has some\nwonderful lines: 'Good to\nmeet you Miss Julie I hope\nyour death is painless'. I also really liked the idea of\nthe collection of deformed\ncrucifixes. Go and see it\nand find out!\nFilms to look forward to\nover the Summer include\nKunchalorsky's 'Runaway\nTrain' (June 27),\nSpielberg's 'The Colour\nPurple' (July 11), Woody\nAllen's 'Hannah and her\nSisters' (July 18)\nFinally Jim's list of 12 of\nthe best films to have\nopened this year (in no\nparticular order): My\nBeautiful Launderette,\nSilverado, Defence of the\nRealm, Colonel Redl,\nJagged Edge, No\nSurrender, Heartbreakers,\nRoom with a View, The\nLightship, To Live and Die\nin LA and After Hours.\nJim Clay den "

    "content": "4)\n3\nSummer\nBenefits\nWelfare Advisor Lesley Gillingham looks\nat what you can claim this Summer.\nIt is now time to think\nabout claiming money over\nthe Summer vacation. This\narticle is designed to give\nyou an idea of what you\ncan claim and how to do it l If you find yourself\nconfused or in difficulties\nthen call into Student\nServices and see Lesley,\nthe Welfare Adviser.\nUndergraduate Students\nUnlike the Christmas and\nEaster vacations, there is\nno element included in the\nstudent grant to cover\n'living expenses' over the\nsummer vacation and\ntherefore if you are unable\nto find a job you will be\neligible to 'sign on' as\nunemployed in the area in\nwhich you are living.\nPostgraduate Students\nPostgraduate students\ncan only 'sign on' in the\nperiod that they are not\nreceiving a grant or\nsponsorship. This is often\ndifficult to prove. However\nyou should be able to claim\nStandard Housing benefit.\nWhich Benefit\nThere are three main\ntypes of benefit:\nUnemployment Benefit,\nSupplementary Benefit and\nHousing Benefit. They are\nnot mu tally exclusive and it\nis possible to receive two\nor in some circumstances\nall three types of benefit at\nthe same time (but only up\nto \u00a330.45 plus rent a week\nfor a single person).\nUnemployment Benefit\nTo be eligible fo> this\nbenefit you will have to\nhave paid or been credited\nwith Class 1 National\nInsurance contributions on\nearning of at least \u00a31767\nbetween April 1984 and\nMarch 1985. This will give\nyou a basic rate of \u00a330.45 a week. (See 'How to claim'\nbelow.\nSupplementary Benefit\nSupplementary Benefit\nwas set up as a 'safety net'\nfor those who did not meet\nthe conditions for\nUnemployment Benefit. It is\nnow the principal source of\nincome for a large portion\nof the unemployed\nincluding most student\nclaimants. Eligibility is\ndependent on the claimants\nability to 'sign on' as\navailable for work in the\narea in which they live.\nThere are three rates of\nbenefit: 'Householder\",\n'Jointholder' and 'Non\nhouseholder'.\nNon Householder Most\nstudents living with a landlady/landlord will be\nclassed as non\nhouseholders. If you are\nclassified as a non\nhouseholder you will\nreceive a basic rate of\n\u00a323.60pw. Joint Householder\nStudents sharing flats will\nbe classed as joint\nhouseholders. The benefit\nrate for a joint householder\nis slightly higher than that\nfor a non householder and\nyou will probably receive a basic rate of approx \u00a325pw. Householder students\nliving in individual beds its may be classed as\nhouseholders. This will give\na basic rate of \u00a329.50pw. The term 'Householder* is\nloose and ill defined and\nopen to appeal but\nobviously the DHSS will\nseek to classify students as\nnon householder where\npossible.\nStudents living in\nColleges Halls of residence\nor houses will almost\ncertainly be classified as\nnon householders.\nHow to Claim\nOn the first weekday of\nthe vacation go to your\nlocal Unemployment\nbenefit office (address in\nthe phone book) and 'sign\non' as available for work.\nTake along your P45 (if you\nhave one) and your\nNational Insurance number.\nThey will tell you any\nfuture arran gm ents for\nsigning on, and get you to\nfill in a number of forms\nand give you a B1 claim\nform which should be taken\nto the local Supplementary\nBenefit-Office. The\nSupplementary Benefit\nOffice will probably call\nyou to an interview and you\nwill need to take certain\ndocument with you rent\nbook/receipts (letter from\nStudents Services if staying\nin College accommodation)\nand a recent bank\nStatement.\nHousing Benefit\nDuring the summer\nvacation your entitlement\nto Housing Benefit will\ndepend on your\ncircumstances. If you are\nreceiving Unemployment\nBenefit or Supplementary\nBenefit, you should receive\nbetween 80-100% of your\nhousing costs back through\nCertificated Housing\nBenefit or through\nStandard Housing Benefit\nand Housing Benefit\nSupplement.\nTypes of Housing Benefit:\nCertificated Housing\nBenefit: for those receiving\nSupplementary Benefit.\nUnder this benefit you may\nreceive 100% of your\nhousing costs.\nStandard Housing Benefit:\nanyone can apply for this\nbenefit if they pay housing\ncost. The basic rebate is\n60% plus additions if your\nincome is below the set\n'Needs allowance.'.\nHousing Benefit\nSupplement: an addition to\nStandard Housing Benefit\nfor those who narrowly\nmiss qualifying for\nSupplementary Benefit on\nincome grounds.\nHow to Claim\nIf you are claiming\nUnemployment or\nSupplementary Benefit: all\nyou need to do is to make\nit clear to the people\ndealing with your claim that\nyou wish to claim Housing\nBenefit. They should then\nsend you all the\nappropriate forms to be\ncompleted and returned to\nyour local Housing\nAuthority.\nIf you are NOT claiming\nUnemployment or\nSupplementary Benefit:\nYou can still claim\nStandard Housing Benefit.\nYou need to submit a claim\nto the local Housing\nAuthority for the area in\nwhich you are paying rent.\nStudent Services have\napplications forms from\nmajority of borough. You\nc liam will be dated from the\nday the Housing Authority\nrecieve s the application\nform, you will need to\nsubmit proof of income and\nproof of how much rent\nyou pay.\nUseful Information\nHolidays Housing Benefit\ncan be paid during\ntemporary absences but\nyou should let the Housing\nBenefit office know your\nplans. For Unemployment\nor Supplementary benefit\nyou can complete a holiday\nform which will allow you\nup to sixteen days away\nwithin the Bristish Isles\nwithout losing benefit but\nmust sign on again as soon\nas you get back. If you go\non holiday abroad you will\nnot be entitled to ANY\nBenefit whilst you are out\nof the country and you\nmust start a completely\nNEW claim as soon as you\nreturn.\nCo-hab l ting When an\nunmarried couple live\ntogether they are treated as\na married couple for benefit\npurposes. The Official\nreason for this regulation is\nto be fair to married\ncouples, but since a married couple receive\nconsiderably less than two\nsingle people it is easy to\nsee another reason for this\nregulation. To avoid being\nclassed as a couple you\nwill have to prove that the\ntwo of you live totally\nindependent, normally you\nwill have to prove you have\nyour own rooms.\nAppeals if you feel your\nbenefit has been incorrectly\nor unfairly assessed don't be afraid to appeal. Call\ninto the Student Services\nas soon as possible to\ndiscuss the procedure, a delay could lose you the\nright to appeal.\nRemember if you\nexperience any problems\ncall Into the student\nservices office and ask to\nsee the Welfare Adviser.\nPrescription Charges\nMany students are eligible\nfor exemption from\nprescription and dental\ncharges on grounds of\nincome. It is worth applying\nto the DHSS on form FP91\nwhich is available in DHSS\noffices and the Health\nCentre.\nIf you application is\nturned down it is often\nworth asking why, and it\nmay be worth appealing\nagainst the decision.\nIf you intend to apply for\nexemption keep receipts for\nany charges made-you may\nbe eligible to have the cost\nrefunded if you are\nsuccessful.\nGood luck!\nRaaman Gillon\nDirector, Health Centre\n10 Wednesday 18 June FELIX\n\n"

    "content": "Many of you will be\nexpecting the last FELIX\neditorial to be a lenght y tirade against Carl, Dave\nand Quentin. It's not going\nto be. One of the things\nthat you learn as FELIX\nEditor is that arguments in\nthe Union are soon\nforgotten. The turnover of\nstudents at any university is\nsuch that within eighteen\nmonths Union arguments\nare forgotten. I would\nimagine that in two years\nfew, if any, students will\nremember much about this\nyear. This year has been\none of significant change\nfor Imperial College, so to\nconcentrate on the Union\nwould be profoundly\nwrong.\naims of universities.\nStudents have been hit\nby the Government's short\nsighted attempts to cut\neducation. Grants for next\nyear have only been raised\nby 2% in cash terms.\nStudents have been told\nthat they may lose their\nrights to claim certain\nbenefits. The government\nappears to have decided\nthat students are easy\ntargets. A fair proportion of\ntory voters believe that\nstudents are lazy dos s ers who are trying to avoid\nhard work. The effect of the\ngrants cuts is very obvious.\nMany current students\nseem to come from middle\nand upper class families.\nMost current students have\nstudents' lives easier, it is\nstill the case, though, that\nsome departments ignore\ntheir students interests. For\nexample Life Sci still\norganise lab session during\nthe College's official\nlunch break. This means\nthat Life Sci students have\nproblems if they want to sit\non certain Union\ncommittee. They have to be\nmarked as absent from lab\nif they want to attend.\nThe Union has, as usual,\nhad problems representing\nstudents on College\ncommittees. Students will\nalways have problems\nwhen they have to\nnegotiate with professional\nadministrators. Student\nrepresentatives have to\nCollege that the Union isn't worth defending.\nThis year there have\nbeen several'significant\nchanges in the college\nadministration. The new\nRector Prof Ash seems\nkeen to take an interest in\nStudent affairs. He has\ngone to Dramsoc shows\nand Rag Fete.\nUnfortunately he seems to\nbe quite good at irritating\nsome of his staff. Rob\nNorthey also seems to be\nquite good at irritating\npeople in his new job as\nRefectory Manager. It is\ndifficult to know whether\nthese two people have\nannoyed the right people.\nIn any organisation there\nwill be some people who\n\u00a9 d tori a In the long term the most\nsignificant thing to happen\nto the College was the\nUGC' s decision to cut the\nCollege's funding yet again.\nThe College has suffered\ncuts in funding in real\nterms for a number of\nyears. The cuts are,\ncausing the College serious\nproblems. Research at the\nCollege is being cut\nbecause there is no money\nfor equipment etc. The\nCollege is unable to recruit\nthe best academics\nbecause it can't afford to\npay them properly an-l in\nmany cases the College is\nunable to replace\nacademics because it is\nhaving to cut staff. The\nrecent statements by the\nDepartment of Education\nand Science suggests that\nnext year the Government\nmay not make any cuts.\nWhile this is good news it\nwon't prevent severe\ndamage being done to\nhigher education.\nUniversities need to be\nproperly funded so that\nBritish industry has the\nflow of ideas, and\ngraduates it need. The\nmajority of the money must\ncome from the\nGovernment. Industrial\nsupport for universities\nnormally ties research and\ncourses to specific short\nterm needs of industry. It is\nup to the Government to\nsupport the longer term\nneeds of industry by\nsupporting the longer term\nlarge overdrafts.\nOne of the disappointing\naspects of the Union this\nyear has been its failure to\nget involved in campaigns\nagainst Government cuts.\nExternal Affairs Officer\nGrenville Manuel has tried\nhard to organise campaigns\nyet apathy on the part of\nthe majority of Union\nOfficers (including\nsabbaticals) has meant that\nIC as usual has hardly been\nrepresented on cuts\ncampaigns. Indeed Imperial\nCollege Union seems\ndetermined to do as much\nharm as it possibly can to\nthe public's image of the\nstudent by continuing to\nsell a Rag Mag that has\nbeen slated in the press, by\norganising events like\nMorphy Day etc. I really\nwonder if the majority of\nstudents care about cuts\nbecause their behaviour\nsuggests they don't. Perhaps they feel that they\nwill have left College by the\ntime cuts campaigns have\nany effect.\nCollege has again shown\na si rt of schizophrenia\nwh n dealing with students.\nAt nines the College has\nshown genuine concern\nabout students interest.\nThe Undergraduate Studies\nCommittee has taken a genuine interests in the\nproblems faced by\nstudents. The report\nproduced by the committee\nis an attempt to reduce\nfailure rates and make\nlearn in a few months skills\nwhich College\nadministrators have had\nyears to learn. This year\nstudents reps have been\nhampered by a breakdown\nin communications within\nthe Union. Some officers\nhave virtually stopped\ntalking to others. Union\nofficers have had to go to\nCollege committees with\nlittle background\nknowledge on the issues to\nbe discussed because they\nhadn't talked to the right\npeople. Carl, Dave and\nQuentin have had their\nsuccesses and failures. In\nmany respects they haven't been,any worse-than other\nsabbaticals. The thing that\nhas marked this years as\nbeing the worst in a long\ntime is the split within the\nUnion. Carl, Dave and\nQuentin must take the\nblame for this.\nMore generally the Union\nhas faced up well to the\nproblems caused by further\ncuts to its funding. The\nincreases in trading activity\nhas been very successful.\nUFC has been realistic\nabout the areas that should\nbe cut. The union has been\nsuccessful at trading and\nall those involved should be\ncongratulated. The Union\nhas, though, lost space\nwith the FELIX Office being\nshunted in to a hole behind\nthe Lounge. It's just a pity\nthat sometimes one gets\nthe impression that there is\nso much apathy round the\nare dead wood and new\nadministrators can often\nimprove things by annoying\nthese people and getting\nthem to leave. The\nproblems come when the\nnew administrator irritates\neff i cent colle ages. Mr\nNorthey has made some\nimprovements though.\nDon Ferguson has been\nthe success of the year. He\nhas had severe problems at\nStudent Services but he\nhas had shown a genuine\ninterest in student Welfare.\nI just hope he doesn't get\ndepressed about the lack of\nsupport there seems to be\nat times from other parts of\nthe College.\nPersonally this year has\nbeen enjoyable although at\ntimes there have been\nsome frustration. There is a full credit list on the\nopposite page and like to\nthank all the people\nmentioned and anyone else\nwho has in any way helped\nme. See you all next year.\nIt difficult to know how to\nthank people who've put\namazing amounts of works\ninto FELIX. People have\nmade real sacrifices for\nFELIX. All I can say is that I really appreciate your\nefforts. I hope that you all\nstill regard me as a friend\nafter a year in which I 've\nnagged you all at times.\nMay I especially thank all\nthe Union's permanent staff\nwho've managed to put up\nwith me despite all my\nfaults.\nWednesday 18 June FELIX\n\n"

    "content": "Simon Singh\nReplies\nIn last week's FELIX Physics Dep Rep Simon Singh was\nattacked by Anon of Ibid In his column 'A Sideways Look'.\nThis week Mr Singh responds. Take It away Simon....\nLast week's FELIX\ncontained an article which\nraised several points\nconcerning the setting up\nand funding of a new\nPhysics departmental\nstudent common room.\nHopefully, the following\nbrief paragraphs will put\npeople's minds at rest\nconcerning the common\nroom as many of the\nconclusions stated were\neither illogical or else\nbased on false information.\nAnon of Ibid's first\nstatement claims that the\nPhysics Department is only -prepared to fund the\nstudent common room in\norder 'to appease the\nseething masses' by 'doing\nvery little'. The Department\nis in fact investing \u00a32000 in\nthe common room venture\nand to suggest that\nmembers of academic staff\nare willing to throw \u00a32000\nat undergraduates in order\nto keep them happy is\nfoolish and naive. The\nquantity of money in\nquestion is approximately\none quarter of the budget\nof any of the CC U's. We\nare not dealing with petty\ncash but rather in terms of\na major Departmental\ndonation. The Physics\ndepartment has already\nsub sidi sed student\npublications, parties, discos\nand sporting events. Its\nreputation in the College is\nhigh with respect to\nstudent welfare and it really\nhas no need for a cosmetic\napproach to student\npolitics.\nAnon of Ibid states that\nthe common room is an\ninsufficient facility, bearing\nin mind that the department\nhas 600 undergraduates.\nThis is true! But in a time\nwhen other departments\nare losing their common\nrooms and postgraduate\nfacilities are also\ndiss appearing surely it is\nbetter to have some kind of\ncommon room than none at\nall. Over three quarters of\nfirst and second year\nundergraduates were in\nfavour of spending any\navailable money on new\ncommon room facilities as\nopposed to computers,\nlibrary books or laboratory\nequipment.\nThe major conclusion of\nlast week's article was the\nclaim that the whole\ncommon room venture was\na clever political ploy on\nmy behalf to win the RCS presidential election. The\nelection was on March 3rd. The common room was not\ngiven the go ahead until\nthe following term and was\nnot announced in FELIX\nuntil May 5th, nor in\nSchrodingers Cat (Physics\nnewsletter) until May 9th. Despite the many talents of\nthe students in RCS, I am\nafraid clairvoyance,\ntelepathy and the ability to\npredict are still alien to\nmost undergraduates. Why\ndoes last week's author find\nit necessary to view any\nachievement as suspicious\nand motivated by\nselfishness?...surely this is\njudgement at its most\nperverse.\nLastly, although\ncriticising Dep Reps is the\nright of every member of\nthe Union taking\nanonymous potshots at\ninnocent first year\nAcademic Reps is a contempt able act.\nWei I.... sorry to have\nbabbled on for so long on a subject which is relevant\nonly to physicists but I am\nafraid that until people\nrealise that FELIX is not the\nplace for petty personal\nvendettas, there is little else\nthat can be done.\nDep Reps as a whole\nhave had a pretty poor\nimage over the past year.\nDave Kingston described\nus collectively as a 'rabble'\nin his annual report and\nthere have been many\ncriticisms of poor\nattendance by Dep Reps at\nimportant Union committee\nmeetings. What has been\ngoing wrong?\nDep Reps are essentially\ndedicated to departmental\nissues concerning their\n'constituents' and they are\noften the first direct contact\nfresher s have with ICU or\nthe CC Us. In many ways\nthe Dep Rep is the ideal\nperson to purvey all that is\ngood about student unions.\nBut in many departments\nthe Dep Rep is seen to be\nan isolated figure, who isn't really fully integrated into\nthe Union hier ar achy.... a rather queer animal with no\nreal place amongst 'the real\nhacks'.\nMost IC Union posts are\nheld by IC Union 'hacks'. A friendly bunch of students\nwho work damn hard on\nour behalf. These people\nhave to work together and\nregularly meet up socially.\nOften election to such\nposition is from within the\nranks, and at least in this\nway students can be\nassured that a sensible\napproach is taken to the\njob in question. A similar\nsystem works within the\nCC Us. Dep Reps are an\nanomaly in the electoral\nprocedure. They tend to be\nfaces familiar within the\ndepartment but generally\nunknown outside that\nparticular environment.\nConsequently when\nattending major Union\ncommittees it is easy for\nDep Reps to feel\nintimidated and isolated.\nThey don't feel confident\nenough to sit with the ICU\nor C CU hacks and Dep\nReps rarely know each\nother well enough to form\ntheir own cliques.\nI know Christine Taig is\nkeen to nurture Dep Rep\ninvolvement next year and\nhopefully I can do my best\nto get RCS Dep Reps in\nparticular to act as a unit.\nDep Reps actually\nrepresent us on Council in\nthe most direct manner\npossible. Their influence\nand responsibilities next\nyear could be significant.\nWith Dep Reps having a higher profile Academic\nand Sdfeial Reps would\nimmediately benefit from\nworking with an influential\nCouncil member, perhaps\nwith a College-wide\nreputation.\nI have spent the last year\nas Dep Rep for 600\nundergraduates and 150\npostgraduates. It's been\ngreat fun and very\nrewarding. I was fortunate\nto know a few other\nCouncil members before I began had I not perhaps\nthings would have been\ndifferent!!!\nSimon Singh\nps Should Anon of Ibid be\nprepared to reveal his/her\nidentity I would be most\npleased to meet him/her in\nopen debate. I am sure that\nthe students of IC would\nappreciate a good old\nbitching session!!\non the i uk e~*~~ Catchi^ the. tube a luj cu^ x sealed, to he. tho_ west t3AC \u00abro^v uL post of tka c La jj by d dnS rsS \u00a3..\\Qrs22 Wednesday 18 June FELIX\n\n"

    "content": "We are extremely\nfortunate that jazz music\nhas evolved side by side\nwith techniques we may\nuse to record it. Indeed,\nwith the exception of the\nelectronic avant-garde\nmusic, that started in the\nlate fifties, jazz is possibly\nthe only form of music to\nhold such a claim. It is,\nhowever, unfortunate that\nat the birth of this new art-form, the opportunities for\nblack performers to record\ntheir work were extremely\nscarce. As jazz has evolved,\nperformers and (especially)\naudiences have tended to\nforget these roots, or at\nbest, to pay some token\nhomage to them, in the\nlight of better times. Hence\nthe spirit behind rhythm\nand blues-slavery,\nsegregation and exile-have\nbeen larg ley displaced by a modern jazz and\nemphasises technique,\nsyncopation, rhythm,\nenergy, to a larg i ey white\naudience. Nevertheless, the\ndriving force behind this\ncreativity, despite its\ndevelopment, remains\nintact; Jazz was expected\nto be about something.\nIn order to express\nthemselves clearly, jazz\nmusicians have used the\nhuman voice to sing, to\nspeak and to use as an\ninstrument in itself. Early\nsingers were\nun constrained; John Lee\nHooker, Leadbelly, Muddy\nWaters and later, BB King\nsung their injustices to an\neager and receptive black\naudience. The pianist, Bud\nPowell, frequently moaned\nand snarled as he played to\nadd emphasis to the mood\nof his music, rather than\ndevelop his unique but\nheavy-handed playing\ntechnique.\nIn this way, black artist of\nthe forties, fifties and early\nsixties were able to express\nthemselves with a certain\nsense of freedom, and yet\nWords To Music\nstill retain the respect of\nwhite audiences that\nallowed them to play in\nclubs, restaurants ann bars\nand earn a living wage.\nMost musicians knew it was\nunethical, but if they were\ngood enough to play in\nwhite clubs, found\nthemselves with little\noption. Other saw it as a chance to directly\nchallenge their audiences\nwith black issues, and it is\nnot co-incidental that many\nof the direct blues singers\nwere women: Billie Holiday\nmade Allan's composition\n'Strange Fruit' and 'God\nBless the Child' lastingly\nfamous; referring to the\nwhite jazz-clubs scattered\nacross Eastern and Middle\nAmerican, Bessie Smith\ncries (in a live record in of\n'Barrelhouse Blues' given to\nan all white audience): '25\ncents? Ha! No, no, I wouldn't pay 25 cents to go\nin nowhere!' For those\nmusicians who staked their\nreputation on per f om ances such a these, it was\ndisheartening to find that,\nto a large number of white\nmusicians, black music was\ntaboo.\nThe overwhelming urge\nfor the black artist to\nexpress himself or herself\nunambiguously was\nreleased in the early six ites by a young saxophonist\ncalled John Coltrane. His\nearly work with Thelonious\nMonk and Miles Davis, with\nwhom he produced 'Kind\nOf Blue', had long\nestablished him as a talented mainstream\nperformer. He played\nincessantly fast, breaking\nbars into sixteenths and\nthirty seconds, and\nintroducing differ rent keys,\nmodes and time signatures\nto his own improvisations,\nwhilst his backing band\nbeat the time of the original\ntheme. After a performance\nof 'My Favourite Things' at\nthe Village Vanguard,\ncritics found themselves\nstrongly divided over his\ntalent:\nThe irrational nature of\nColtrane's playing broke\nJazz music into two. Artist\nsuch as Archie Shepp,\nOrnette Coleman and Don\nCherry were directly\ninfluenced by John\nColtrane, creating an\nexperimental 'Free Form'\njazz that was angry,\nchallenging and frequently\nde rise as, for example,\nShepp's 'Rufus (turned his\nface to he wind and the\nrope broke his neck)'..\nReactionary music such as\nthis, however, was far more\nenigmatic to white\naudiences than were the\ndouble-entendres of the\nblues-singers twenty years\npreviously; although of\nsome interest to musicians,\n'The Art Of the\nImprovisers', as Coleman\ndescribed the movement,\nwas largely irrelevant.\nglissando riffs of free-form\nsaxophone. Short words\nare preferred, in the same\nway that a performer will\nuse single run in notes and\nnot block chords.\nSyncopation is introduced\nby rhyming words on\nupbeats or at irregular\nintervals; monosyllables\nalso help in this respect,\nmaking the text more\nflexible. Colours are\nespecially important. Apart\nfrom the more obvious\npsychedelic connotation,\ncolours are str on l gy suggestive of mode, pitch\nand timbre, and many\ncolours juxtaposed with\neach other emphasise the\npowerful confusion of freeform jazz and its underlying\nspirit:\nJazz poetry has often been\ncorrectly linked to 'Rap',\nrhyming couplets spoken\nover a simple funk backing\nor syncopated drum beat.\nFew of these compositions,\nhowever, capture the\nessence behind modern\njazz. Early recordings dealt\nwith black issues;\nac como dati on, segregation al apartheid. As\n'Rap' has developed,\nJazz...America's only true art form.\nFar more influential were\nthose artists who combined\nfree-form jazz with the\nspoken word: Charles\nMingus, Max Roach, Miles\nDavis, and the work of Jala\nNuriddin and the Last\nPoeters. Using modern jazz\nas a medium for poetry,\ncomposers were able to\nunderline important aspects\nof their music in verse,\nwhilst black poets,\ndiscredited or suppressed\nin white literary circles,\nused universally admired\nmusician, such as Herbie\nHancock and Chick Corea\nwho were rapidly becoming\nestablished in 'funk' and\n'jazz fusion', as vehicle for\ntheir work.\nMuch of the early jazz\npoetry draws is material\nfrom transcendental or\nnarcotic drug experiences,\napocalyptic or prophetic\nChristian and Muslim texts\nor black political writing.\nNone of this was original;\nbebop singers or 'wailers'\nof the forties had delighted\nin taking common music-hall and vaudeville tunes\nand pla gia rising their lyrics\nwith surreal images.\nStylistically, however, the\nnew poetry attempts to\nclosely imitate the\nperforming jazz instrument,\nindulging in long sections\nof text without punctuation\nto simulate the ch act eris tic however, it has become\nmore a platform for a performers ego rather than\npolitical issues. In addition,\n'Rap' was conceived with\none principle ambition: to\nprovide a different form of\nmusic to dance\" to, where a free-form jazz has steadily\nprofessed away from the\nconstrains t of rhythm.\nThere are signs, however,\nthat the new poetry has\ncome more moderate,\npre sum bly to influence a younger generation. Archie\nShepp mixes his live\nperformances with freeform jazz and the very\nroots of jazz: rhythm and\nblues. Gil Scott Heron has\nenjoyed a recent rise in\npopularity. The new jazz-revivalists, Working Week,\nin corporate d Jalal\nNuridden in a new work,\n'Stella Marina' for their\ndebut LP, 'Working Nights'.\nWomen poets have also\ntaken to jazz music as a means of expression, as for\nexample Maggie Nichols\nand The Feminist\nImprovising Group, and a novel recording company,\nStroppy cow. As the\npopularity of jazz increases,\nspurred on by the spate of\n'revivals', there is a strong\nchance that Jazz Poetry\nmay once more develop\nand encourage the roots of\nblack music to grow.\n>\n\u2022I FELIX Wednesday 18 June 11\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX looks back at the stories which made the headlines\nmost consistently this year.\nThe early part of this year was\ndominated by the struggle for\ncontrol of the Union Building. For\nthe first few weeks of the autumn\nterm the front pages of FELIX lead\nwith the moves to takeover the\nUnion Bar. Towards. Christmas\nnegotiations between College\nadministration and IC Union over\nother areas of the Union building\nmade most of the headlines.\nBefore term began there was a dispute over a rise in bar prices,\nintroduced by Refectory Manager\nRob Northey. Union representatives objected and were able to\nnegotiate a few reductions. Trouble\nflared in Freshers' week when\nUnion barmen Doug Armstrong\nand Brian Ellison resigned because\nof a disagreement with Mr Northey\nover the running of the bar at the\nNew Year Party. Student bar staff\nreacted angrily when the two\nregular barmen were prevented\nfrom working their one month's notice. The day after the\nresignations the first Union\nGeneral Meeting of term backed a proposal for a one week boycott of\nall the College bars in protest\nagainst Mr Northey's manage-ment. Union President Carl\nBurgess put forward the view that\nthe Union should try to takeover\nthe bar, though he was later able to\ndeny that the boycott was planned\nto help the Union gain control. The\nboycott itself was well supported,\nwith only a handful of students\nchoosing to drink in any of the\nCollege bars.\nCollege Secretary John Smith\nOF THE C OATH^'' coa\n'^nger a some s,'*>) Fusion:\n\u2122at hanger as omg s split off:\nif A agreed to investigate the possibility\nof a takeover but immediately\nsuggested that the issue should be\ndiscussed in 'a wider context' and\nsaid that the use of other rooms\nwould also be considered. Mr\nSmith prepared a draft document\non the takeover which was\nsubmitted and approved at a meeting of College House\nCommittee on November 6.\nThough Mr Smith presented the\npaper jointly with Mr Burgess the\noriginal draft was submitted\nunaltered, after Mr Burgess had\ndecided to ignore am mend ment s suggested by other senior Union\nOfficers. On the day after House\nCommittee met, Mr Smith sent Mr\nBurgess a letter say ng that it was\nthe College's intention to transfer\ncontrol of the Botany-Zoology\nCommon Room and the Lounge to\nthe Biology Department. At the\nnext meeting of ICU Council Mr\nBurgess was attacked for not\npublic ising the details of Mr\nSmith's letter before Council met.\nHe was also criticised for failing to\nimplement the suggested changes\nto the plans for the bar takeover.\nCouncil instructed Mr Burgess to\nmake it known to College\nadministration that the transfer of\nthe rooms did not have Union\napproval, and to ask that plans for\nthe bar takeover be halted until the\nmatter had been resolved.\nTowards the end of the term,\nCollege agreed that the Union\nDining Hall and Senior Common\nRoom should be used by the\nBiology Department as seminar\nrooms, but should remain in Union\ncontrol. Just before Christmas it\nwas agreed that there would be a phased takeover of the Union Bar,\nbeginning on January 1 and being\nfinalised on July 1. These schemes\nwere approved by Council.\nFollowing the resignations of\nDoug Armstrong and Brian Ellison\nthere was a series of personnel\nchanges in the Union Bar. Mr\nNorthey first appointed Mr Tony\nMcVey, who had previously\nworked in the refectories, as Bar\nManager. Only two weeks after\nbeing appointed, however, Mr\nMcVey was dismissed for failing to\nopen the bar on Saturday night. Mr\nMcVey told FELIX that he had\nbeen ill with a form of food\npoisoning. Former student Dave\nBrennan was then made Bar\nManager, only to resign in the\npenultimate week of term after\nlosing \u00a3100 of takings. The current\nManager, Mr Moore Lyttle, was\nappointed when the Union took\ncontrol of the bar in January.\nAnother story to make news\nearly in the year was the decision of\nthe Sabbatical Officers to ban this\nyears Rag Mag. Union Sabbaticals\nare entrusted with the right to\ncensor the Rag Mag, but only a portion of the paste-ups were\nchecked before the publication was\nsent to be printed. President Carl\nBurgess stepped in to prevent the\nsale of the Rag Mag when it was\nreturned from the printers, a decision which potentially wasted\nthe \u00a31500 spent on the Rag Mag. A motion to reverse the ban was\nupheld at the first UGM of the\nProfessor Manny Lehman\nyear, however, and Mr Burgess was\ncensured for failing to edit the most\noffensive material.\nThe involvement of Imperial\nCollege academics in the US\nStrategic Defence Intiative ('Star\nWars') has been featured regularly\nthis year. In October it was\ndiscovered that Emeritus Professor\nManny Lehman of the Computing\nDepartment had signed a contract\nto work on SDI. Professor Lehman\nsaid that he thought the US system\nwas impossible because software of\nsuffice nt size and complexity could\nnot be built, but that his research\nwould have enormous benefits for\nsociety. Most of the other DOC\nacademics disagreed and sent a The bar takeover\nmust be discussed\nin a wider context\npetition to the Prime Minister and\nthe Financial Times, dissociating\nthemselves from the project.\nProfessor Bruce Sayers, Head of\nDOC, did not sign the petition but\nsaid that he thought SDI would not\nwork and that the research might\ndivert resources away from other\nprojects. Towards the end of the\nspring term, FELIX lead with an\nexclusive story explaining how US\nofficials connected with SDI might\nbe empowered to classify British\nresearch projects as a result of an\nagreement signed by US Defence\nSecretary Caspar Weinberger and\nformer Secretary of State for\nDefence Michael Heseltine. More\nrecently Mr George GallagherDaggitt of the Ministry of Defence\nwrote to all British universities\nencouraging applications for Star\nWars research contracts, giving the\nassurance that there was no danger\nof research work being classified.\nAs yet only three academics from\nIC are understood to be chasing\nSDI contracts.\nIn January many of IC's administrative and academic staff\nsupported the national day of\naction, organised by the\nAssociation of University Teachers\nand the National Association of\nLocal Government Officers, and\ntook part in the one-day strike. The\nAUT was protesting against the\nGoverment's poor funding of\nHigher Education and was striking\nfor the first time in its history. The\nday of action was acclaimed as very\nsuccessful and received the support\nof IC Union and of the Rector,\nProfessor Ash. ICU organised its\nown day of protest on January 24\nin response to the announcement of\na2% increase in next year's student\ngrant and the withdrawal of\nstudents' e legibility to claim\nbenefits during short vacations.\nYou know why they like me at ULU?\nNo Dave?!\nWell it's because they can see I 've been\ndoing two jobs. I 've been doing both the\nPresident's job and the Deputy\nPresident's job.\nThis con in cide d with student\ndemonstrations instigated by the\nNUS all over the country.\nProblems in Southside Halls\nwere again in the news this year. In\nthe first term residents of Selkirk\nand Tizard Halls opposed plans to\nconvert a small number of rooms\ninto staircase kitchens. Building\nwork which was required to bring\nthe halls into line with fire\nable to continue to provide its\npresent level of financial support. Other London Colleges have since\nagreed to share the cost of the\nservice more fully. Though the\ndetails have yet to be finalised,\nCollege Assistant Secretary\nMichael Arthur has given the\nassurance that the service will not\nbe closed down.\nRecent items of news have\nMeeting referred back the annual\nreports written by President Carl\nBurgess and Deputy President\nDave Kingston.\nFinally, it appears that this will\nbe the last term-time FELIX is\nproduced in the present office.\nCollege's intention to move the\nFELIX office was first made\nknown shortly after Christmas,\nwhen the move was proposed as a FELIX staff say goodbye to their office\nregulations has gone ahead as\nplanned, however.\nThe future of West London\nNightline looked in doubt last year\nafter College administration\nannounced that IC would not be\nincluded the announcement of a prospective merger with St Mary's Medical School and the occupation\nof the Libyan Consulate in Princes\nGardens by student squatters. Last\nmonth the Union Annual General\n18 Wednesday 18 June\nlong-term solution to satisfy the\nspace needs of the Biology\ndepartment, instead of using the\nUDH and SCR as seminar rooms.\nThough Council supported FELIX\neditor Hugh Southey's objections\nto a move of the office, the financial\ncompensation which College\nadministration are offering makes\nthe move difficult to resist. The\nUnion cannot afford the\nre investment which is desperately\nneeded if the Print Unit is to\nsurvive. After 12 years on this site\nFELIX is now close to agreeing a final version of the plans for a new\noffice in the kitchen area behind the\nLounge.\n19\n\n"

The\nDemonstration was\norganised by the\nAssociation of University\nTeachers (AUT) and who\nhad limited support from\nthe ASTM S and NAL GO. The protest began with a march from Gordon Square\nto the Department of\nEducation and Science,\nwhere a mock examination\npaper was presented to\nEducation minister Kenneth\nBaker, 'Questioning' the\nGovernment on its record\nto date. The meeting then\nmoved on to Central Hall,\nwhere Liberal leader David\nSteel, SDP Leader David\nOwen, and Labour MP\nGiles Radice made\nspeeches..\nThe demonstration\nproceeded to Westminster\nitself where a massive\nlobbying exercise was\norganised Professor Frank\nLeppington of ICAUT, said\nthat the majority of staff\nwere members of the AUT, but a small number of\nrepresentatives from the\nother campus Unions had\nalso attended.\n| $ H Hi Hill Uf f;l|i\\ ri 1\nBar Blues\nThe transfer of the Union\nBar licence will be delayed\nfor at least two months.\nThe licence es were due to\nchange on July 1, but due\nto a misunderstanding of\nthe requirements for\ntransfer of the licence the\nUnion will not be able to\ncomplete the takover for\nthe Union Bar until early\nSeptember.\nUnion President Carl\nBurgess told FELIX that he\nhad thought that a simple\ncovering letter from the\nCollege's Licencees would\nbe adequate to transfer the\nbar to the Union's nominees. In fact the\ntransfer first requires the\napproval of Bar Committee.\nThis was not discovered\nuntil the deadline of the\nLicence application had\narrived.\nMr Burgess commented\nthat the delay would make\nlittle difference since only\nthe Summer vacation would\nbe affected. He explained\nthat Refectory Manager\nRob Northey, the Current\nLicencee, was willing to\nkeep his name on the\nLicense until after the\ntakeover could be\nconfirmed.

Dr Andrew\nSessler of the Lawrence\nLivermore Naitonal\nLaboratory in American\nhad to wait one year after\ncompletion of his research\nbefore the SDIO finally\nagreed to allow publication.\nDr Sessler is working on\nfree electron lasers.\nIn a recent interview Dr\nSessler said that when the\nresearch had reached an\nadvanced stage, he had\nbeen asked 'to keep quiet'\nabout his findings even\nthough the project was not\nclassified. Originally the\nwork had been funded by\nthe Department of Energy.\nDr Sessler said he had\nnever signed a contract\nwhich imposed restriction\non publication.

    "content": "Politics Of SDI\nHassled(?) FELIX Reporter\nBill R2D2' Goodwin takes a look at some of the political\nconcerns.\nThe Strategic Defence\nInitiative, more commonly\nknown as Star Wars, is a huge project comparable in\nsize to the Apollo\nprogramme. With an annual\nbudget of $3 billion, it\nbrings together hundreds\nof scientific disciplines in a research programme which\naims to make nuclear\nweapons 'obsolete and\nredundant'. Not\nsurprisingly, it has raised a great many questions.\nAcademics wonder how\nmuch money they can\nsqueeze from the USA.\nWhether they will be able\nto publish work that they\ndo for SDI, and whether\nAmerican firms will be able\nto 'rip off British ideas.\nPeace groups worry that\nthe deployment of SDI will -bring about the end of the\nA BM( Anti-Ballistic Missile)\ntreaty and will cause an\nescalation in the arms race,\nor whether SDI will provide\na Soviet first strike,\nscientists wonder if SDI will\nwork at all, and pol tic ian s are concerned that the\nwhole project may be a waste of money. As Tarn\nDalyell MP told FELIX\n'Universities such as IC and\nHerriot Watt must make up\ntheir mind whether they\nwant American gold more\nthan the failure to\nparticipate in a reckless\nand un peaceful programme'.\nIn December 1985 Micheal\nHeseltine and Casper\nWeinburger sig end an\nagreement known as the\nMemorandum of\nUnderstanding (MOU)\noutlining British\ninvolvement in SDI. The\ndocument has been\ndeclared secret in\nperpetuity.\nSince then West\nGermany and Israel have\njoined the Star Wars\nprogramme. They too, have\ntheir own MOU agreements.\nPOT OF GOLD? One of the myths\nconcerning SDI is that the\nAmericans will be handing\nover a 'pot of gold'. Before\nthe MOU was signed\nHeseltine was trying to\nobtain contracts of $1.5\nbillion for the UK based on\na list of 18 research areas.'\nAs the negotiations\nproceeded', said Sandy\nVerscvow of the US\nEmbassy, 'It was\nrecognised that the US\ncould not set aside money\nfor any one country'. As a result Britain will receive\nfrom 7 to 10 industrial\ncontracts worth an\nestimated $30 mill lion. It\nwill also have to compete\nfor projects in the next\nround of research.\n'Heseltine expressed\nchagrin at the number of\ncontracts', admitted Mr\nVerscvow.\nThe UK, though has been\ngiven one exclusive project:\nthe 'European Computer\nArchitecture' study, worth\n\u00a37.2m. The study will\nconsider 'The scientific and\ntechnological possibilities\nand obstacles to building\nSDI'. The program will, if\nsuccessful give Britain the\nleading edge in the\ncompetition for the next\nresearch phase.\nCLASSIFICATION ?\nThe secret nature of the\nMOU has aroused much\nspeculation. British\nresearchers are concerned\nthat they may be prevented\nfrom publishing any SDI\nwork they do, and they\nwonder what protection\nthey have against American\nfirms 'ripping off their\nideas. University academics\nare particular y concerned\nas their careers depend on\nthem publishing their\nfindings. The concept has\nbeen given the buzz words\n'Intellectual Property Right'\nor IPR. At the hub of the\nproblem is the question can\nthe Americans apply\nAmerican law in Britain?\nThe question has become\nknown as the\n'extraterritorial it y' debate.\nAccording to the Defence\nProcurement Minister John\nLee 'Depending on the\nnature of the contractual\narrangements applicable to\neach piece of work placed\nin the UK, either US or UK\nlaw may apply.' In cases\nwhere extraterritorial it y does apply the US may /\nhave the right to classify '\nwork at any time. Whether\nthey will apply pressure on\nBritish researchers in the\nsame way that pressure\nwas placed on an American\nAcademic, Andrew Sessler,\nto keep his research quiet\nduring a non-classified\nproject on electron beams,\nis a matter for debate. As\nMr Verscvow pointed out\n'one should not make\njudgements on individual\ncases.'.\nTHE MC TL The Pentagon's attempts to\nkeep technology from the\nRussians have led to the\ninstitution of the Military\nCritical Technology List\n(MCTL). Technology\nplaced on the list is subject\nto restrictions to prevent it\nfrom falling into the hands\nof the Soviet Union. In\nFebruary a stir was caused\nwhen Clarence Robinson\narrived in Britain on a contract to place British\ntechnology on the list,\nwithout the knowledge of\nthe British Government.\n(See FELIX No 733).\nAcademics at IC were\nworried that their work\nwould be placed on the list\nwith the result that they\nwould be prevented from\npublishing. As it turned out\nMr Robinson was refused\naccess to classified work at\nGEC and Aerospace by Mr\nHambleton of the MOD( who was later moved to a different job). Finally Mr\nRobinson was thrown out\nof Britain by the US\nEmbassy. The fact that the\nPentagon felt they had the\nright to look at British\nResearch, because of the\nMOU, has caused people\nsuch as Paddy Ashdown\nMP to postulate that the\nBritish Government has\nbeen 'hoodwinked'.\nFour months earlier in\nNovember, American\nrepresentatives visited\nImperial itself. A group\nfrom United Technologies\narrived to inquire about the\nareas of research in which\nIC was a world leader. A later visit by representatives\nfrom the Pentagon was\ncancelled when academics\nfrom IC sent a letter to Mrs\nThatcher condemning SDI\nresearch, according to\nRichard Ennals, who\nresigned from IC in protest\nover SDI.\nTHE MOU Fears were aroused when\nthe German MOU was\nleaked to the press. The\nUS, it said, had been given\nultimate control over\nclassification in Germany.\nIt was thought that the\nBritish MOU might contain\nsimilar statements. As it\nturned out the British\nagreement was much more\nfavourable.\nThe British MOU was put\nItogether in a hurry, late at\nnight, and has been\ndescribed by one of the\nnegotiators as a 'very\nideo sync rat ic document'.\nEven so, the British\nGovernment is said to be\npleased with the deal.\nSources who have seen\nthe MOU have told FELIX\nthat it contains details of\nmutual defence\narrangements, nuclear\nweapons, NATO and\ngeneral treaty obligations,\nalthough this is denied at\nthe American Embassy.\nThe document has been\nkept secret at American\ninsistence, but has been\nshown to companies such\nas Marconi who are\ndeemed to be trustworthy.\nThe MOD'S SDI office is\nprepared to show the MOU to people it considers\ntrustworthy in universities,\naccording to a former\ndirector.\nTwo clauses are of\nparticular interest to\nacademics. The first gives\nBritish researchers a veto\nover the American use of\nBritish work. The second is\na proviso that the US companies sign an\nagreement not to rip off\nBritish work. Richard\nEnnals told FELIX,\nhowever, that he felt the\nclauses were 'not worth the\npaper they are written on'.\nHe pointed out that British\nacademics could not refer\nto the clauses in a court of\n'law given the fact that they\nare secret and the\nacademics in theory would\nnot known of their\nexistance.\nWILL SDI WORK? The task of producing an\neffective missile defence\nsystem is at the very least\ndifficult. There have been\nseveral studies designed\njust to show how difficult.\nOne such study by the\nMassachussetts Institute of\nTechnology, concluded\nthat the equipment and fuel\nnec ess are y for a space\nbased chemical laser\nsystem would take ten\nspace shuttles making\nthree trips a year three\nthousand years to\nassemble. A ground based\nsystem on the other hand\nwould use 60% of the US\npower supply. Perhaps the\nmost dubious aspect is that\nof computing. David Parnas\nof the SDIO Panel on\nComputing in Support of\nBattle Management\nresigned his position in\nprotest against SDI, had\nproduced a lenght y document explaining why\nthe computing side of SDI\nwon't work. The difficulty\nlies in producing ten\nmillion lines of error free\ncode, bearing in mind that\none error could mean the\nstart of a nuclear war.\nCREDITS: Special thanks to\nPaul Walton, Paddy As hJ down, Andy, Pete and the US\nl Embassy.

The\nmeeting was to have discussed the awarding of the\nPresident's UGA, as well as officers' reports and\nawards to members of the Union.\nIn the event, after\nconsultation with the\nsabbaticals Chairman Hugh\nStiles decided that a meeting of those present\nshould be held, using\nCouncil's Standing Orders\nand following the same\nagenda. However any\ndecisions taken would have\nto be ratified at the first\nCouncil of next term, and\ncould in principle be\noverturned.\nPresident Carl Burgess\nand Deputy-President Dave\nKingston submitted new\nversions of their annual\nreports which had been\nreferred back at the ICU\nAnnual General Meeting on\nMay 22nd. The new reports\nhad had the offending parts\ndeleted but the bodies of\nthe texts remained\nunchanged. There were no\nobjections to the revised\nreports and they were\npassed provisionally.\nMinutes of previous\nmeeting of the various\nminor subcommittees were\nread and discussed,\nalthough it was reiterated\nthat no firm decisions\ncould be made or matters\narising from them, and that\nthe meeting could only\nindicate its f eling s to the\nincoming Exec, which\nwould have to make any\ndecisions on these matters\nover the summer.\nSome of the scheduled\nelections took place\nalthough the elections for\nCouncil Chairman and a representative to sit on the\nFinance and Executive and\nGoverning Body College\nCommittee were deemed to\nbe too important for the\nmeeting to decide, and\nwere held over until the\nnext Council meeting. Pete\nWilson was provisionally\nelected as a representative\nto the Departmental\nComputing Committee,\nSteve Flower to the\nHumanities Committee, Ian\nHowgate to the Students\nResidence Committee and\nHugh Southey to Wine\nCommittee.\nFinally outgoing\nmembers of Council were\nasked to decide if they\nwere to vote on the awards.\nHugh Stiles said that this\nwas the \"last chance that\nthe candidates for awards\nwould have to be judged by\ntheir peers.\" The meeting\nagreed, although there\nwere only nine members of\noutgoing Council present\nout of a theoretical\nminimum of twenty four to\nvote on them.\nThe President'sUGA was\nawarded on a straight vote\nwithout discussion\nfollowing a procedural\nmotion that the question be\nput. The matter had been\ncarried over from the last\nCouncil. Pots were\nawarded to Nick Shackley,\nAlan Rose and Quentin\nFontana. Honorary Life\nMemberships were awarded\nto Quentin Fontana, Pascal\nCarr, J Martin Taylor and\nDave Kingston for services\nto the Union.\nAfter the meeting Hugh\nStiles said that he was very\ndisappointed with the poor\nturnout, the worst that he\nhad seen in the three years\nhe had sat on Council. Carl\nBurgess was also\ndisappointed with the\nturnout and said that \"most\nof the recommendations\nwill go to the Exec meeting\non Friday and since they\nwill have to make all the\ndecisions because Council\nwas in quo rate then there is\nreason why they can be\ncriticised for taking them.\"\nHe added: \"You cannot\nexpect UG Ms to be quo rate but you can usually expect\nCouncil to be.\" He also\nsaid that Hugh Stiles had\nmade the right decision to\npress ahead with the\njudging of awards as this\nwas the last opportunity for\noutgoing Council to\ndiscuss them. He agreed\nwith Tim Palmer that it was\na farce for nine people to\nvote on the awards, but\nthat those present had\nadopted a sensible attitude\nto the matters discussed.\nPresident-elect Christine\nTaig regarded the meeting\nas \"a waste of time\". She\nsaid that she had submitted\ntwo nominations for .\nHonorary Life Memberships\nbut withdrew them before\nwalking out, feeling that it\nwould be an insult to give\nawards at such an\nunrepresentative meeting.\nShe added that she had a lot of sympathy with Hugh\nStiles but believes\n\"decisions were taken\nwhich would have gone\notherwise had the meeting\nbeen qu cf rate.\" Honorary Secretary\nQuentin Fontana also\nwalked out of the meeting\nin disgust, to return later.\nHe was very disappointed,\nespecially as \u00a335 of Union\nmoney and two days of his\ntime had been wasted on\npreparing the Council\npapers which had gone\nlargely unused.\nCouncil is a committee of 48 elected representatives of the\nUnion, including the Sabbaticals, CCU Presidents, Officers\n(including Welfare, Womens', Academic Affairs etc.) and\nDep Reps. As such it has the highest powers of any\ncommittee, and is responsible for any changes in the\nUnion.

    "content": "uS\nBy\nNobody in College is\ncertain what will happen in 1\nthe twenty years time. In\nthe last twenty years the\ni universities have gone\nthrough massive expansion\nfollowing the Robins\nreport and then contraction\nin recent years under the\nThatcher government so\nnobody can realistically\npredict in any detail what\nI IC will be like in fifteen or\nI twenty years. A new\nI political party in\nGovernment may mean a change in the level of\nj universities' funding. As I Prof Sayers, Dean of Guilds\nJ told FELIX 'anybody can\n| guess and your guess is as\n' good as mine.'\nchange are the research\nand teaching subject. As the College plan says 'new\nresearch areas and new\nsubjects at both\nundergraduate and\npostgraduates levels must\nbe established and\nencouraged.'. The College\nplan is aimed at operating\n'suffice nt flexibility to allow\nresources to be moved\nfrom contracting to new\nand expanding activities'. In\nother words College\nbelieves that they have to\nplan so that they can keep\nthe College at the forefront\nof tech on ology. Prof Cole,\nDean of RCS, told FELIX\nthat 'there are people who\nare waiting for a 'because the\nfuture is hard to\nfor tell, it isn'ta good excuse for\nnot having a plan'\nThe College has to\nattempt to overcome these\nproblems though and plan\nfor the future. Ever since\nthe Jarett report on\nincreasing of fic ien cy in\nhigher education, the\nCollege has been expected\nto have a cohesive strategy\nfor the future. The College\nhas a Development\nPlanning Group which is\nmeant to look at strategy\nfor developing the College\nand there is a College plan\ncontaining submission by\nall of the department etc\nabout their plans for the\nfuture. This means that one\ncan make some general\npredictions about future of\nthe College. Although as\nthe Rector Prof Ash said\n'because the future is so\nuncertain all planning will\nbe subject to what actually\nhappens next and we are\nquite likely to find\nourselves going along\npaths somewhat different\nfrom those envisaged'. He\nadded though that 'it is\nvery important to stress\nthat just because the future\nis hard to for tell, it isn'ta good excuse for not having\na plan'.\nIt seems to be generally\nagreed thai the actual\nnumbers of students and\nthe balance between\npostgraduates and\nundergraduates won't change substantially. Prof\nAsh believes that College\nwill expand the student\nnumbers but will be limited\nto restrictions on the site.\nWhat does seem likely to\nbandwagon to jump on.\nWhat makes IC a very\nexciting place is we do\nexpect to create are own\nnew bandwagons'.\nThere are several factors\nthat academics fear could\nprevent IC remaining at the\nforefront of science and\nengineering. Firstly there is\nthe fear that further cuts in\nuniversity funding will be\nso damage IC that it will be\nunable to finance changes\nin the research being\ncarried out in the College.\nProf Brown, Dean of RS M said that his biggest fear\nfor the future of IC was that\n'Maggie Thatcher will be\nIC: Has\nyears 35 members of staff\nwould go. This could be\ndone by closing one\nmedium size department or\nby natural wastage across\n'biggest fear for\nthe future of IC\nwas that 'Maggie\nThatcher will be\nre-elected'\nre-elected'. When the UGC wrote to IC several yeas\nago, the College replied\nsaying that\n\u2022 Level Funding would\nprevent any major\nexpansions. Any new areas\nof activity would mean cuts\nelsewhere in the College.\nNo new 4 year courses\ncould be developed and\nsome areas of research\n'valuable to the community'\ncould not be pursued.\n\u2022 one percent cut for five\nall departments. If done by\nwastage then staff loses\nwould be uneven and\ntherefore in certain areas\nthat would be no expertise\nand courses would have\ntheir syllabus changed.\n\u2022 Two per cent every year\nfor five years 80 academics\nstaff would have to go,\nresulting in the closure of\ntwo medium sized\ndepartments or a natural\nwastage policy so severe\nthat most undergraduate\ncourses would have to be\ndowngraded or even\nwithdrawn. In addition it\nwould be unlikely that all\nthe College buildings could\nbe maintained-one would\nhave to be sold or\ndemolished. This year the\ncollege was cut by over 3%.\nProfessor Ash described\nthis year's university cuts\nas 'Bad, there simply isn't enough money to go\nround. Against that\nbackground I think that\nImperial College has done\nreally rather well....The\njudgement that has been\nmade on our research puts\nus on the same level as\nOxford, Cambridge and\nUniversity College...If we\nwere to have similar cuts\nfor the next five years the\neffects would be\ndisaster o us.| think we can\nsee the magnitude of the\ndisaster I'd prefer to guess\nat the vector because thats\nsomething one would have\nto face if it was going to\nhappen.\nOne of the departments\nthat seems to be most at\n30\nWednes\nA Future\nrisk is that humanities\ndepartment which Union\nPresident Carl Burgess\nexpressed worry about he\nstatements promising\nincreased cash for\nuniversities before he lost\nhis job as Education\n'education is an\nissue on which ,\nvotes will depend'\nfact that the humanities\ndepartment was placed\nbelow average in research.\n'If can't have any other\noutlet such as pottery, art,\nmusic, literature and such\nlike I think it will be a poor\nplace with poor atmosphere\nand people will just\nbecome mechanical\nrobots'. Prof Cole echoed\nthis worry.\n'I think it is a pity financial\ncontra in sts make associate\nstudy marginal in hard\ntimes'.\nYet things are not as bad\nas they could be. Sir Keith\nJoseph made several\nMinister.\nProfessor Ash along with\nmany observers of the\nsituation bele ives that more\nmoney will be available\nnext year. 'I think it has\nbecome evident that\neducation is an issue on\nwhich votes will depend\nand I believe therefore that\nit is probably that there will\nbe additional funding for\nthe universities. I hope\nthere will be enough\nfunding so that for a little\nwhile at least we can go\nalong on a constant income\nbasis.\nIC has anyway come off\nbetter than many other\nuniversities. In the most\nrecent load of cuts a number of un iver is ties were\ncut, by over 5% in real\nterms, and are warning that\nthey will be bankrupted.\nProf Sayers thought that IC\nwould 'find ways round the\nfianc i al issue...difficult and\nunpleasant though it will be\nand everyone will suffer'.\nOne way to increase\nincome is to sell research.\nAs Prof Cole put it 'We\nought to recon gnis e that\nscientific information is a commodity'. The College\ncommissioned a report\ncalled 'Commercialization\nof Research At Imperial\na major problems in that\nthey can very often not\nlook in their own\nlaboratories at a horizon\nthat is more than about two\nor three years away. It is\nprecisely to help them to\nsee what will happen in the\nnext ten years that will turn\nto universities and this is\nprecisely the sort of\ninteraction that I am\ninterested in fostering.\nWhich doesn't alter the fact\nthat in engineering\ndepartments it is perfectly .\nappropriate to be working\non stimulating and creative\nresearch that will find\napplication in the short\nterm... most people who\n'I am worried\nabout the\nincreasing\npressure that\nthere is on staff\nto do research\nfor commercial\npurposes'\nCollege'. From Rhys Jones\nConsultants. Academics,\nthough, have expressed\nfear that basic\nfund una mental research\nmight be sacrificed. Prof\nBrown said 'I am worried\nabout the increasing\npressure that there is on\nstaff to do re a search for\ncommercial purposes\nrather than research for\nI know that some\nmembers of the Governing\nBody and some\nadministrators seem to\nthink that is why research\nis done or should be done\nand I'm one member of the\nstaff who's not happy about\nit. Prof Coles said that he\nwas worried that industry\nexpected universities to do\nresearch that produced\nmarket ably products within\n. seven years and was also\nunwilling to pay. Prof\nSayers defends for informal\nresearch. 'If we say right\nthis is part of our duty at\nnational level then the way\nin which we use our time\nand the way in extent to\nwhich public money is used\nand the extend can exploit\nresearch and do expo lit our research by choice will\nI think fall into place'.\nProfessor Ash argues that\nthis shouldn't necessarily\nmean a greater\nconcentration on-short\nterm research. 'Industrial\nResearch laboratories have\nhave been involved in\nfunding research realise the\nfact that getting money is\neasy. What you need to do\nis get money to do the\nthings you want to do and I have great confidence in\nmy colleagues at IC that\nthey will succeed in doing\nthe later'.\nThe other major threat to\nthe College staying at the\nforefront of science and\ntechnology is pay for as\neveryone must know\nacademics are paid\nsignificantly less than their\ncounterparts in industry.\nFor example in Petroleum\nEngineering academics are\npayed roughly half what\ntheir counterparts in\nindustry are paid. College\nacademics are worried even\nif the money was available\nto recruit their succesors,\nnobody of sufficient quality\nwould apply.\nThey are particularly\nworried that although\ntalented people may be\ntempted to work as\nacademics for a short\nperiod, in the long term the\nlimited promotion\"\nopportunities and the poor\nrates of pay for senior\nlecturers and readers will\nmean that few people plan\nto make a career in\nindustry.\nThe Association Of\nUniversity Teachers have\nrecently started ne go cia ting I(1 ay 18 June31 "

    "content": "Beanfield, the Stonehenge Festival\nwill be taking place in some form\nor another \u2014 if only at the\nMagistrate's Court in Winchester.\nIf you've never been arrested,\nhad your car impounded and\nbeen beaten around the head\nwith a riot shield, then here's your big chance. Seriously, this\nevent needs all the support it can\nget, unless you really want to see\nthe country degenerate into a model of South Africa or Russia,\ncontrolled by a set of pass laws.\nYou can find all about it from\nthe 'hippies' own publication,\nFestival Eye, a snip at only 70p from the FELIX Office.\nA week later, once again at\nMilton Keynes Bowl, Marillion\nheadline a heavy rock bash,\nfeaturing Gary Moore, Magnum,\nthe really awful Mama's Boys and\n'special guests', Jethro Tull in\ntheir new synthetic, shrink-wrapped cellophane guise\n(Tickets \u00a312.00 plus booking fee).\nAlso on June 28th, Sting, Boy\nGeorge, Gary Kemp, the\nCommunards and Billy Bragg will\nbe appearing at an Anti-Apartheid\nbenefit. The free concert is to be\npreceded by a march from Hyde\nPark, and one of the organisers,\nJerry Dammers said:\n\"The concert is for the benefit\nof those who take part in the\nmarch from Hyde Park which\nstarts at 1 lam, and I hope that\neveryone who goes to the concert\nwill go on the march first. The\nevent may be the last of its kind\nbecause after the Police Bill goes\nthrough Parliament, things like\nthis may not be allowed.\"\nNot content with that lot, on\nthe very same weekend, London\nis treated to the indoor Reggae\nSunsplash. Currently on the lineup are Alton Ellis, the Wailers,\nAswad, Black Uhuru, King Sounds\nand the Israelites (Tickets: \u00a317).\nThe Editor keeps on telling me\nit's really crucial, and feeds\nendless reggae tapes into the\nghetto blaster just to prove it.\nOf course there's always the\nlast Wham! gig ever at Wembley\nStadium \u2014 the only problem is\nthat it's already sold out. Bit of a shame that.\nIt's good old has-been s time on\nJuly 5th, with Rod Stewart and\nELO, also at Wembley Stadium,\npropped up by Feargal Sharkey\nand the Blow Monkeys. And the\nbad news isn't over there, it costs\n\u00a315 to boot, on top of the cost of\nthe binoculars. More has-been s follow on July 11th and 12th with Queen and Status Quo on\ntheir 76th farewell tour. The\nAlarm try to achieve rock\nimmortality by supporting them;\nit's probably about the closest\nthey'll get. If these sell out, which\nthey look likely to do, there's another performance at\nKnebworth Park on August 9th \u2022 (Tickets: \u00a314.50 plus booking\nfee).\nMeanwhile, back at another\nfarm, we have Siouxsie and the\nBanshees headlining the WOMAD\nFestival (July 18th \u201420th, Kenn\nPier Farm, Cleveden, near\nBristol). This festival features\nsome of the world's most\ninnovative music-makers with\nmutant funk band Chakk and\nmetal bash ers23 Skidoo amongst\nothers as the English bands.\nBack in London, on July 26th and 27th we have the Damned's10 th Anniversary Tea Party at\nFinsbury Park. Thefirstgig\nfeatures the suddenly ubiquitous\nDr and the Medics, Screaming\nBlue Messiahs and the March\nViolets, while the second one has\nthe Fall, the Mission and Pete\nShelley.\n/n door rock venues range from\nthe awful to the really good, the\nproblem being that some of the\nbest bands, famous and just\nstarting out play in the worst\nones. The biggest offenders are\nundoubtedly Dingwalls and the\nHammersmith Odeon. The first\nfeatures up-and-coming bands,\njust about to break big, who have\nthe problem of playing in a corridor with a bar at the back\n\u2014 avoid unless you're really\ndesperate. The Odeon has all the\nbands that have made it while\nthey crank up to playing the\namphitheatres at Wembley, but it\nhas all the charm and character\nof a derelict aircraft hanger. To\nmake matters worse it is staffed\nby over-zealous bouncers. The\nbest point about the Odeon is\nthat it sells tickets for the\ncavernous dancing space of the\nHammersmith Palais, even if the\ndrinks are extortionate ly expensive. The Palais is one of\nthe few venues left of\nintermediate size ever since the\nsad passing of the Lyceum in\nAldwych. When bands get so big\nthey have to play places like\nWembley Arena there aren't any\nalternatives and you just have to\ncope with seeing the band as\npinpoints on the horizon. But at\nthe small end of the market there\nis a nice selection of venues,\nwhich have the cosy cupboard\natmosphere of the Marquee\n(probably the cheapest drinks at\nany concert) or the greater space\nof the Town and Country Club,\nalthough this one is rather\nexpensive compared to a lot of\nsimilar venues.\nMusic of a different kind is\noffered at the Almeida\nInternational Festival of\nContemporary Music and\nPerformance, it's been running\nfor a while, but doesn't finish\nuntil July 6th. Philip Glass, Steve\nReich and John Cage are all part\nof the offerings, with a lot of\nmodern Spanish music.\nThere's space to give the WH\nSmith Cushion Concerts another\nplug. For just \u00a33 you get to go *\na classical concert at the Roya\nAcademy of Arts in Piccadilly,\nplus free Admission to a prva te viewing of the RA's Summer\nExhibition \u2014 since that's where\nthe concerts are held. The\nconcerts are on Thursday, from\nJune 26th to July 17th, the\nviewing is at 6:30pm and the\nconcerts at 7:30.\nAnd this is where Capital Ideas\nfinally leaves you for the time\nbeing. Perhaps we'll be back, and\nperhaps we won't. "

    "content": "Love him or\nhate him noone can deny\nthat Rex\nReeves has\nmade an\nimpact on the\nworld. In an\nexclusive\ninterview w FELIX Rex\ntalks about his\nire eric lu ding his\ntime as as tude ipl^ Colleg\n-When he graduated in 1972 Matthew\nJohnson seemed destined to be one of\nthe world's non-entities. Fourteen years\nlater he's known as Rex Reeves and and\nseen by many as one of the driving\nforces behind British rock music of the\n70's. He's slightly built, deceptively tall\nand totally obnoxious -or at least that is\nwhat the press would have you believe.\nOn meeting him in person all those\npress cuttings seemed so far away from\nreality I thought he'd sent a stand in.\nDressed in an immaculate navy blue\nsuit.his hair permed to hide the thin\npatches and sporting stylish red glasses\nthe former wild man of rock had\nobviously changed. His features are\nremarkably angelic for a man branded\nby many as evil and they certainly belie\nhis thirty five years.\n'Just because I don't smash up hotel\nrooms and kill an ni mals with my teeth\nI'm supposed to have sold out. People\njust don't seem to have grasped the\nwhole statement I was trying to make\nthrough my music. My generation had\neverything the kids of the sixties had\nbut we were robbed of any sense of\n\"I dedicated my 'wide eyed\nand legless' cover version\nto leprosy research\"\noriginality -everything had been done\nbefore. Freud was right, it's all a matter\nof penis frustration really, we just had\nto wait for an opening. The quickest\nway to succeed isn't to push hard but to\nknow where you want to go.' I decided\nto let the opening remark pass and ask\nhim about his time at college.\nAt Imperial Rex learned all the arts\nassociated with wine, women and song,\nthe second being an even rarer\ncommodity then than it is now. It took\nhim only three lectures to realise that\nphysics didn't interest him, but in those\ndays the grant was plentiful and, as this\nyears ICU President has proved, it\ndoesn't take much to get a degree in\nphysics. Music played a very important\npart in his life and in those early\nexperimental days he showed the great\nvers it ili ty of the bass guitar. He laughed\nas he told me that his first band was\ncalled The Cockroaches in fond\nmemory of his room in Beit Hall.\nAfter graduating Rex joined the\ncountless hoards trying to discover\ntheir true selves. 'The work I did at that\ntime was full of a prime vil energy that\njust flowed through me every hour of\nthe day. It was to attenuate my body to\nits e the rial frequency that I began to\ntake LSD and it opened out whole new\nvistas for me. It was the gateway to the\nwork I knew was within me. I had an\nirresistible urge to communicate, every\nnote I produced seemed predestined by\na mighty power. You can't explain that\nsort of experience in terms of words.'\nThis desire to explore the more offbeat realms of personal experience is\nbelieved to have been partially\nresponsible for his classification as a complete n utter by his critics. Rex\nspent over three years in the musical\nwilderness before he was offered his\nfirst recording contract. It had been his\n\"It's all a matter of penis\nfrustration really\"\nsupreme goal but success was ell u sive. 'The visual spectacle of my art has\nalways been as important to me as the\naural. I once bit off the head of a white\nswan on stage in Birmingham but you\ncan't capture that sort of statement on a record and the film companies just\nweren't interested.\nIt was for the nature of his charity\nwork that Rex received most flack in the\npress. 'I vividly remember the outcry\nfrom the self proclaimed protectors of\npublic decency when I dedicated the\nproceeds of my 'wide eyed and legless'\ncover version to leprosy research. It's at\ntimes like that when everything you\nstand for is being trampled on that you\nreally find out who your true friends\nare. The record company disowned me\nand people I had trusted wrote terrible\nthings about me in the press, claiming I took drugs, was cruel to animals and\nwas totally insane. I was outraged at\nthese lies but I knew the establishment\nhad been against me ever since my\nteacher burned my creative composition\nin front of the class.'\nRex was soon blacked by every\nrecord company in the UK. Desperately\nseeking an outlet for his natural\ncreativity he finally found the role that\nhas earned him \u00a3 2 m in the last five\nyears. 'I finally feel fulfilled knowing my\nwork reaches thousands of people\nevery day. I was overjoyed when I was\ngiven the Mills & Boon contract, though\nit sadly caused at lot of problems with\nthe few friends who had stuck by me. I felt I was being labelled and refused to\nbe shoved into a box and forgotten. My\nfirst major work was Hidden Depths and\ntold the story of a young checkout girl\nwho was initially rejected by\nauthoritarian society but eventually\nfinds full fill ment by marrying a policeman. The story operates on\nseveral l~ 'els depending on the nature\nof the re a car. For me the most striking\nfacet is the total rejection of the\nFreudian ethos of sexual causality by\nthe girl, who insists on maintaining her\nvirginity until the wedding night. I further ex plc ed this theme in my\nsecond book, Forbidden Love, which\nexplores the conflict between a docker s daughter and her so called betters\nbefore she finds happiness with the\nmanager of the fruit canning factory\nwhere she works.' I could see the gleam\nin his eye as Rex talked at length of\nthese major works which were both\nnominated for the Jane Lovelace\nMemorial Award. At last his great\ngenius had been acknowledged, a final\ndefiant gesture to those who call him\ninsane.\nUnder his pen name of Victoria Pearl\nRex has recently teamed up with Claire\nRaynor (alias Greg 'Pecker' Williams of\nThe Rubbers) to produce a best selling\ndiet book for the American market. Rex\nfirmly believes in the high fat, high\ncarbohydrate, low fibre diet which he\nhas personaly practiced for the whole\nof his life. This tough regime, known as\nthe Binge Plan, has proved immensely\npopular with the health-conscious\n\"I was overjoyed when I was given the Mills & Boon\ncontract\"\nAmericans and Rex will finish a British\nedition once he has fully recovered\nfrom his recent heart bypass operation.\nSadly, Rex now acknowledges tba%\nhis recording career is over having |\nfought many battles to maintain his\nartistic integrity. His music failed to get\nhis message but writing has given him a second chance. He looks back with\naffection to the week when he received\ntwenty thousand fan letters each day\nafter one appearance on the Old Grey\nWhistle Test. Perhaps calling Anne Nightingale a stupid bag on air will be\nhis most lasting claim to fame.\nNext week Felix will interview Albert\nSprog, a world famous banana grower\nwho graduated in civil engineering in\n1967.\n\n"

To be\nmore precise I'm going to\nbe nice to 3 people-namely\nthis years Exec. This trio of\nbastian s of the Union have\nreceived no end of stick\nsince even before this\nacademic year began.\nThe cover of the ICU\nHandbook, which serves as\nan introduction to IC for\nmany fresher s, even\nattacked the President,\nleading to instant credibility\nproblems for Carl among\nall of the first years. Even\nCollege had its go at the\nExec by trying to ban him\nfro iT j the usual presidential\nplace in Linstead Hail, and\nthere were so many other\nreported items on the new\nExec over the Summer that\nthere is not enough space\nto list them. This is hardly\nthe sort of thing that is\nlikely to encourage 3\npeople in positions of\nresponsibility at the start of\ntheir term of Office!\nThen, as the year\nprogressed, more s lagging off, potential and real\nsuccesses or for what ever\nreasons, always reported,\nand personal animosities\ngrowing all the time.\nLooking at it from the\nExec's point of view, when\nall they have got for 6\nmonths, is criticism and\ncomplaints its not\nsurprising that they feel\nthat all they get from\nstudents is 'a load of grief.\nNow it looks up to now if\nI'm saying bad news should\nnot be reported. That's not\nwhat I'm trying to get at.\nOur problem at the start of\nthis year was that personal\nanimosities and prejudices\ncaused a lot of damage\nbefore anything got started,\nand certainly some of our\ncurrent problems have\nbeen inherited from them.\nMy first plea, dream,\nrequest or whatever, is that\npeople reporting events or\nproducing publications\nkeep personal comments\nwhere they belong-ie out of\nfactual reporting. Indeed\nthose are the self same\ngrounds on which Dave\nand Carl's reports were\nrejected this year. It's a principle that could well be\napplied elsewhere. (And\nsince this is a comment\narticle of a sort I can get\naway with it).\nNow its all very well to \u2022 -*\nsay that personal\nanimosities have caused\nsome of our problems this\nyear, and its not surprising\nthat College should take\nadvantage of the divided\nUnion in such areas as the\nBot Zoo and FELIX\ntakeovers, but we should\nlook at the root of this bad\nfeeling. It al! starts well\nbefore last year's election,\nwhen the sabbatical\ncandidates became clear.\nThe outstanding character\nof all the candidates was\ntheir mediocrity. None of\nthem were especially\nexperienced in the Union.\nCarl had been a joke\ncandidate for President two\nyears previously, Quentin's highest post previously was\nCoffee Machine Rep (but in\nmy humble view has done\nthe best job of the 3 this\nyear), and Dave was a failed Dep Rep. And they\nwere the best of the lot!\nThe real problem is not that\nthe wrong people were\nelected, as some of those\nwho initially dogged the\nExec may think, but that\nthe Union posts did not\nattract people of a suffice nt calibre. I could make a snide comment about\ndemocracy, but I did that\nlast week. No, the real\nproblem is that doing\nthings essentially for other\npeople, such as\nWednesday 18 June\n\n"

That is if you\ndon't want to see it in real life.\nSeeing a match on the centre\ncourt is often tricky, but some\ngood tennis can be seen on the\nperipheral courts, and it's just\nthat bit cheaper.\nIf you want to watch a really\nrelaxing sport, then there'll be\nplenty of cricket at the Oval\n(Oval tube) and at Lords (St\nJohn's Wood tube) where the test\nmatch against Pakistan is to be\nplayed this summer.\nStill on the sport, away in that\nother capital \u2014 Edinburgh \u2014 the\nCommonwealth Games are being\nheld, as long as the rest of the\nCommonwealth don't boycott us\nfor not boycotting South Africa.\nThat little show rolls on at the\nend of July, to be followed by\nthe Edinburgh Festival: a city-wide circus of military tattoos,\nconcerts and some very odd\nplays.

The general\nadvice is to avoid the multi-screen jobs like the\nHammersmith ABC and the\nCannon Chelsea which have a multitude of screens and films\nbut very little in the way of leg-room. Surprisingly enough the\nLeicester Square cinemas are\noften much better value with\n70mm screens, bouncy seats and\nreal stereo sound.

For a few smackers you\ncan get to see four or five films all through the small hours right\nup to breakfast time.

The\nfresh-faced chemical engineer\ngave evidence of his irrational\nenthusiasm early on by sticking\nto the mind-blowing ly tedious\njob of 'What's On' editor for six\nmonths.\nThroughout the three years\nbefore he became editor, Hugh\nwas one of the most dedicated\nself-publicists in College. As\nwell as sitting on most of the\nimportant Union committees,\nHugh made sure he was never\nout of the news. In his second\nyear he was pictured on the\nfront page of FELIX, having\nsaved an injured pigeon from\nbeing run over in Prince\nConsort Road. (The wretched\nbird was bumped off shortly\nafterwards, but this was not\nrecorded).\nDespite his broad experience\nof College life, Hugh has always\nbeen uncontrollably nervous\nand fidgety, and has great\ndifficulty standing still for more\nthan a few seconds. This is due\nto a combination of his youthful\nexuberance and limited sex life.\nRecently he spent six weeks\ntrying to find a partner for the\nCollege Dinner, and ended up\ntaking a friend's fiance. (Anyone\nwho might be interested in\naccompanying Hugh on the\nweekend for two in Paris which\nhe won in the Rag Fete raffle\nshould contact the FELIX\nOffice).\nBy his third year Hugh had\nmade such a good job of\nblowing his own trumpet that he\nwon the election for FELIX\neditor by a landslide majority\nthough the fact that his main\nrival had never entered the\noffice before might have aided\nhis easy win. Hugh celebrated\nhis trui mph by getting\nhopelessly drunk and screaming\n'No, no, no!' at the top of his\nvoice, whilst standing in the\nmiddle of Princes Gardens at\n2am. He began his reign as\neditor by subjecting the staff to\na constant barrage of his limited\nmusical tastes. Our ears were\nconstantly assailed by his 'gang\nof four' tapes, played in\ncontinual rotation. Hugh's other\nantisocial habits include\ncontinually neglecting to do the\nwashing up and a sadistic\nknack of farting in the camera\nroom.\nHugh is something of an IC\nRadio hack and last year took\npart in a 'strip for Rag' show\nwith several other IC\nnotables\u2014Hugh's bum beamed\nforth from the following issue of\nFELIX.

Though he lead\nthe FELIX football team to their\nfirst ever victory last year his\ncricket ing prowess is rather\nbasic. Whilst playing in the\nannual FELIX fixture he was\nstruck on the head by a 'fast'\nbowler after losing sight of the\nball completely.

St\nSteven's were not impressed\nwhen he turned up in casualty\nwith a second fracture of the\nsame thumb.\nThis year, not least because\nof an endless series of technical\nproblems, Hugh has had to put\nin an immense amount of time\nin order to bring FELIX out\nevery Friday.

    "content": "- 1\nCarl Burgess\nThe FELIX Interview\nCarl Burgess will be remembered by many as a weak President who was frequently criticised for\nhis unrepresentative decision-making and poor\npersonal conduct. In an end-of-session interview\nwith FELIX last week he reviewed the Union's achievements and setbacks.\nFELIX: Much of your time\nis spent on College\ncommittees. How effective\ndo you think you have\nbeen in representing the\nUnion at this level?\nCB: I think I 've done what\nI'm supposed to do; put\nforward the Union's viewpoint, or the students'\nviewpoint in fact, for\nexample on issues such\nas accommodation. At\nGoverning Body I 've said\nthat the major problem for\nstudents is the lack of\naccommodation available,\nand this has been a prevalent issue for many\nyears now.\nFELIX: The early part of\nthe year was dominated\nby the takeover of the\nUnion Bar. How\nsuccessful financially has\nthis venture been so far,\nand are there, in your\nopinion, more ordinary\nstudents using the Bar?\nCB: It was very difficult to\nbuild up trade in the\ninitial instance when we\ntook it over because there\nwas so much trouble in\nthe first term with a selection of Bar Managers\ncoming and going, and\nvarious acts of vandalism\nand wanton destruction.\nWith the Bar boycott\noccurring it drove a lot of\ncustom away in the first\nplace, but ever since we\ntook over in January there\nhas been a general\nincrease in the number of\npeople coming to the Bar.\nIt has actually generated\nenough money for us to\nbe able to forecast that\nwe will be able to build up\nthe Lounge and have a more social area instead\nof a hacks' bar.\nFELIX: This year has been\none of considerable\nchange around IC. One\naspect of this has been\nthe arrival of a new\nRector. What is your\nopinion of Professor Ash\nso far?\nFELIX\nCB: My opinion of the\nRector is that he's a very,\nvery keen, well-motivated\nand well-meaning person.\nHe was a student at this\nCollege and he has\nvarious ideas of how it\nwas then, and he has\nbeen trying to learn\nwhat's actually happening\nnow. He's visited all the\nresidences as far as\npossible in the time\navailable, and he's visited\nall the departments. He\nhas taken a very active\ninterest in academic\nstandards and in\nteaching. He wants to see .\nthings changing for the\nbetter. He doesn't want to\nsee us rest on our laurels.\nFELIX: At the AGM your\nannual report was\nreferred back and you are\nnot writing a new one, I believe...\nCB: I was quite glad to\nsee that people were\nthere trying to uphold\ntheir beliefs and disagree\nwith what I said. It makes\na great change. When\npeople don't even bother\nturning up to criticise\nwhat you've\nsaid\u2014because, I mean, it\nwas my viewpoint and if\npeople disagree with it\nstrongly, which they did,\nand were willing to stand\nup for their own viewpoint\nand get mine defeated\nthen that's a good thing.\nI 've put in my Council\nreport the same AGM\nreport with the offending\narticles removed, so there\nwould be a record of what\nI thought the year had\nbeen like, because the\nmajority of the report was\naccurate and valid in my\nview.\nFELIX: You've awarded\nfour UGAs this year, but\nnot to either of the other\nUnion Sabbatical Officers.\nIs this a sign that you are\nat all dissatisfied with the\nperformances of Dave\nKingston and Quentin\nFontana?\nCB: This is not the case\nat all. My view of the\nUnion General Award is\nthat it is the greatest\naward the Union can give,\nand it is for services\nwhich go past one single\nyear. It is an award for\nservices in all your time at\nCollege. For one year's work I feel the UGA\nwould be undervalued.\nFELIX: Council has yet to\nmake a decision on\nwhether or not to award a UGA to yourself. Do you\nfeel that some members\nof Council have not fully\nappreciated the efforts\nyou have made this year?\nCB: That might have been\nmy fault for not\ncommunicating as well as\nI could have what I'd been\ndoing, but it's very\ndifficult to do so. You\nhave to balance up the\ntime you've got to write a report and trie time you\nspend doing other things.\nEither you spend more\ntime writing a report and\nthen you detract from the\ntime you get to do\nsomething you need to\ndo, or you leave\nsomething out of your\nreport and do things but\ndon't report them.\nFELIX: What do you feel\nhave been your main\nfailings as President this\nyear.\nCB: My main failing has\nbeen a lack of\ncommunication; I haven't been able to\ncommunicate properly\nwith the student body, I don't think. I have been\nable to get on well with\nthe people in the\nSherfield Building and\nexpress my points very\nwell and succinctly, but I haven't been able to\nexpress myself properly,\nboth on paper and at\nUGM's and Council.\nFELIX: College Assistant\nSecretary Michael Arthur\nhas expressed some\nalarm recently over the\nmisuse of supermarket\ntrolleys around College.\nDo you share his\nconcern?\nCB: I think Michael's just\nover-reacting. It's so\nridiculous. Everybody's been using trolleys since\ntime immemorial. You find\nthem everywhere, all over\nthe street. You don't even\nhave to take them from\nWartrose. I mean, they're\nthe most convenient\nmode of transport even\nfor the Estates workers.\nYou couldn't do without\ntrolleys here. I think it's a classic over-reaction.\nFELIX: Finally, Carl, what\nis your most prominent\nmemory of your time at\nIC?\nCB: I can't remember.\nX17 "

    "content": "renews For a man of some-78\nyears, Max Wall is a remarkably sharp and\nassertive actor and by his\nown admission, reluctant to\nperform when he is past his\nbest. Krapp's Laat Tape is\nhis new production at the\nRiverside Studios, part of a tribute to Samuel Beckett\non his eightieth birthday.\nAlthough it has been ten\nyears since Wall last\nperformed the piece, of all\nBeckett's plays Krapp's Laat Tape will be the one\nfor which he is most\nremembered; he chooses to\nreflect as much upon his\nown varied career as Krapp\ndoes over his 'Lost Love';\n'perhaps my best years are\ngone, but I wouldn't want\nthem back, not with the fire\nin me now'.\nKrapp's Last Tape is a short play for one man and\na tape recorder. Krapp,\nlistens to recordings of\nhimself as a younger man:\nthe death of his mother and\nhis lover; little changes for\nKrapp; more regretful,\nperhaps, but thirty years\non, there is little that he\nwould want or need to add\nto his testimonies. The tapes are the same as those\nused ten years previously,\nand Wall, a decade on\ngives a performance as\nprecise and as genuine as\nthese recordings; but with\nan even deeper sense of\nregret.\nEndgame is the second\npart of Riverside's tribute to\nBeckett. The play is set in a precisely circular room, in\nwhich lives Clov, Hamm\nand his parents, each\nconfined to a dustbin. They\nwhile away their time,\n'making progress' towards\nsome unspecified objective\nabout which they know\nnothing, except that it will\nbe reached, and shortly.\nClov, spying the arrival of\nsome character through a window, prepares to leave\nHamm, but never moves.\nThe scene is abandoned;\nunfinished and unending as\na circle. The director\nCharlie Hanson, sees fit to\nforego any novelties and\nconcentrates on the\nmaligned aspect of\nBeckett's work: its Irish\nhumour. The meaning\nspeaks for itself in the\nwords of the play', says\nHanson. More importantly\nthe company has\nreinterpreted the way in\nwhich they are spoken to\nsuit as wide an audience as\npossible through the use of\ncomedy. Using a completely Irish cast,\n(except Sylvester Moran as\nHamm), Hanson has made\nEndgame into a lightweight\nand lucid piece and yet,\nsurprisingly, it still has that\nsense of sober order\ncharacteristic of its time.\nThis production is a perfect\ntribute to one of the\ngreatest playwrights of this\ncentury.\nJohn Burgess\nMAX WALL\n'I only do Beckett plays now I don't think the others are any good'\nby Jim Cartwrlght at The Royal Court until July 5th Road is the best\nproduction that I have\nseen. It is fatuous to be\nclever with words and try\nand detail all that this\nunique experience offers;\naccept that Road is\nbrilliant, and go.\n'Down Road', a street in a small Lancashire town, you\nmove through the painful\nand humourous lives of\nthose who live there. Buy\nsome chips, watch an old\nlady putting on her lipstick,\na skinhead freaking out\nabout fighting, two young\npeople who just give up\nand die, or just dance with\nScullery (Edward Tudorpole). 'You'll meet all-sorts',\nfor Road allows you to walk\nwith the cast, to become\npart of the experience and\nso get closer to it. But\nRoad is not something\ntangible that can be\ndescribed, it must be felt,\nlike it is by those involved;\nfor the cast aren't acting,\nthey're being.\n'If you're ever in the area\ncall again.' I'm going to see\nRoad again and again and\n.again.... Simon Lewis\n\n"

    "content": "I Whatever Happened To...?\ni PUL On Friday October 18th FELIX printed a letter from\nDr R Benodekar, a research\nassistant in Mechanical\nEngineering. Dr Benodekar\nwrote 'Whosoever did the\nact of cowardice of\nthrowing a carrier bag full\nof water on me, on\nTuesday the 8th October in\nthe gents toilet on the 7th floor of Mech Eng at 14.00\nshould come forward and\nlet me know what his\nintentions were'. These two\ninnocuous column inches\nannounced the arrival of a College personality whose\nidentity is still.not known.\nFor a few short weeks the\n'Phantom Soaker' was the\nmost dreaded man in\nCollege.\nBy the time FELIX was\npublished on Friday\nOctober 25 there had been\n3 more confirmed soakings,\nall in the Physics\nDepartment. It then came\nto light that the Phantom\nhad been operating since\nmid-September, and 30\n'strikes' had already been\nreported, largely in the\nSherfield Building. FELIX\nreceived a letter, signed by\nthe Phantom, claiming\nresponsibility for the\nsoaking of Dr Benodekar.\nChief Security Officer\nGeoffrey Reeves was\ninitially reluctant to say\nwhat schemes were being\nput into action to catch the\nphantom, and only\ncommented that he was\nconcerned for his mental\nhealth. This situation\nchanged one week later\nwhen Mr Reeves himself\nbecame the next Soaker\nvictim. He told FELIX that\n\u00a350 of his clothing had\nbeen damaged by the\nSoaker and announced his\nintention to make the\nculprit pay for the damage.\nMr Reeves chanelle d all the\navailable manpower into\nthe hunt for the Soaker and\ntook charge of the\ninvestigation personally but\nstill drew a blank. A second\nletter was sent to the FELIX\noffice, ridiculing the efforts\nmade to catch him and\nnaming Tuesday November\n19 as the date of his next\nstrike. Though the\nhandwriting was different\nfrom that in the previous\nletter, Mr Reeves was\nI convinced that they were\nwritten by the same person.\nOn November 19 the\nCollege was rocked by the\nnews that ICU President\nCarl Burgess had been\nsoaked in the Sherfield\nlavatories. This was later\ndiscovered to be a hoax\nsoak, however, and was not\nattributed to the Phantom.\nBy the end of November\nthe soakings had ceased.\nAs mysteriously as he had\nbegun his reign of terror,\nthe Phantom disappeared,\nleaving Mr Reeves shocked,\nstunned, and no nearer to\ndiscovering his identity.\nThe man behind the plastic\ncarrier bag is still at large.\nMr Reeves closed the\nSoaker case just before\nChristmas, convinced that\nthe soakings were at an\nend. FELIX moles were\nable to infiltrate the inner\ncircles of the IC security\norgans ation and gain\naccess to Mr Reeves' files.\nThe extract printed here is\na list of suspects drawn up\nby Mr Reeves and gives an\nindication of the progress\nhe had made when the\ncase was closed.\nSoaker File\nJOHN SMOOTH\nCollege typist.

    "content": "Cold\nComfort\nThermographic\nMeasurements, a South\nWirral company, has\nintroduced the\n'Chillchecker', to protect\nfrozen and chilled goods.\nIt is most important that\nfrozen foodstuffs and\nmedical supplies should\nnot be thawed out, and\nthen re-frozen, before they\nreach their user. The\nChillchecker is a self-adhesive disk that can be\napplied to frozen goods\nbefore freezing. The\nChillchecker is then\nactivated by pressing the\ncentre. Once pressed, the\ndevice changes colour if\nsubjected to temperatures\nabove its rating. The\nChillcheckers come in a range of eight bands from17 \u00b0C to + 2 0 \u00b0 C, each band\naccurate to within \u00b1 1 \u00b0 C. The only problem is that\nthe Chillcheckers cost\nabout 50 pence each,\nwhich adds rather a lot to\nthe price of a packet of\npeas.\nPest\nLecture\nOn 10'June 1986, Dr GA Norton (director of Silwood\nCentre of Pest\nManagement) gave the 14th lecture in the series on\nScience and public policy,\nwhich is jointly sponsored\nby Imperial College and the\nScience Policy Research\nUnit. The title was Pesf\nmanagement and world\nagriculture-research,\nextension and policy. In his\nlecture Norton highlighted\nthe relationship between\nscientific R and D and\nsocio-economic factors.\nThe problem is often\ninterdisciplinary and close\nco-operation with farmers\nis essential if methods\nformulated are to work. In\nthe past, however, Pest\nManagement fi as often\nbeen hampered by\nscientific 'paradigms' eg the\nconcept of 'integrated pest\nmanagement'. It is Norton's belief that if future\nsolutions in pest\nmanagement are to be\nsuccesful then a far more\nobjective approach to the\nproblems under\nconsideration will be\nneeded.\nThe Week In Science\nTime Out Meets Tomorrow's World\nWorld's First Leech Farm\nBiopharm (UK), situated in\nSwansea, Wales, claims to\nbe the only leech farm in\nthe world. The leeches are\nbred in their\nthousands\u2014current stocks\nrun to about 30000\u2014and\nare exported, mostly for\nmedical use, throughout\nthe world.\nA zoologist from South\nCarolina established the\ncompany to provide\nleeches for the\ndevelopment of the\nbiochemical and clinical\nuses of products derived\nfrom the salivary secretions\nof leeches.\nIn the course of\nevolution, leeches have\nbecome specially adapted\nto sucking mammalian\nblood. As a result they\nproduce a number of\np harm a co logically active\ncompounds which are\nsecreted by their salivary\nglands and which facilitate\ntheir feeding off the host.\nLeeches are already used\nin plastic surge y to restore\nthe circulation in re planted fingers or ears, where their\naction depends on the\nactive compounds released\nby the leech, which help\nrestore the circulation.\nNASA's Water\nThrust\nDespite many setbacks in\nspace exploration in recent\nmonths, the US National\nAeronautics and Space\nAdministration (NASA)\ncontinues it's research into\nspace travel.\nGround testing of an\nauxiliary propulsion system\nfor NASA's Space Station\nhas shown that thrusters\ncan operate for long\nperiods without hardware\ndegradation.\nThe new technology that\nhas been developed uses\nelectrolysis of water\non h^ ard the Space Station\nas the propellant source for\nthe t fr uster s. Water is\nbroken down into hydrogen\nand oxygen, and these\ngases are then burnt as\nfuel.\nTests >i ave been\nconducted for NASA's Lewis Research Centre,\nCleveland, US, by Bell\nAerospace and Aerojet\nTechSystem. The two\ncompanies were awarded\nparallel contracts last year\nto design, fabricate and test\nsmall thrusters based on\ntechnology developed by\nNASA's office of\naeronautics and space\ntechnology.\nThe thrusters ran for\n22,000 seconds. NASA's Space Stations is in tende to last for about 10 years,\nso a run of 40,000 to 60,000\nseconds is the goal.\nFormula Shell Puts Spark In Petrol\nFor many years the oil\ncompanies have claimed\nthat their petrol contains a 'secret ingredient'. Now\nShell claims to sell petrol\nthat reduces fuel\nconsumption, reduces\nexhaust emissions, cleans\nthe engine and leads to\nsmoother driving. In the\nwords of the market\nresearcher, Shell has\ndeveloped a 'unique selling\nposition'.\nFormula Shell contains a cocktail of surface active\nagents: there is a detergent\nthat keeps the engine\nclean; and there is a spark\naid er,a potassium\ncompound that is deposited\non the electrode of the\nspark plug, and leads to a stronger flame kernel in the\nspark.\nOil companies started\nadding to petrol in the\n1920s, when driving\nbecame more and more\npopular, the demand for\npetrol increased, and oil\nrefiners had to crack heavy\ncrude oil fractions to give\npetrol grade hydrocarbons.\nSo Shell's petrol is not\nunusual in that all petrol s contain additives. The\nclaim is that Formula Shell\ngives better performance\nthan the competition.\nRoad tests have been\nperformed over 4 million\nmiles, using 400 different\ncars, old and new. The\nresults show fuel economy\nincreases of more than 2\nper cent, and carbon\nmonoxide exhaust emission\nreduced by 26 per cent.\nThere was no spark plug\nfouling, no degradation in\nengine lubricant\nperformance, and no toxic\npotassium salts in the\nexhaust, says Shell.\nThe only effective way to\ncontrol exhaust emissions,\nhowever, is by use of\ncatalytic converters. There\nis the three-way converter,\nthat renders harmless\ncarbon monoxide, nitrogen\noxides and hydrocarbons.\nAnd there is the 'lean burn' engine which allows a very\nhigh proportion of air to\npetrol, but still requires a catalyst to remove\nhydrocarbons. Whichever\ncatalytic method is used,\nthe petrol must be free of\nlead: lead poisons platinum\ncatalysts, as well as\npolluting the environment.\nThis is going to be the\nmajor challenge to oil\nrefiners in this country, if\nand when Britain goes for\nlead-free petrol. High\noctane unleaded petrol is\nexpensive to refine, and\nlow octane unleaded petrol\nis expensive to burn.\nFELIX Wednesday 18 June 29\n\n"
