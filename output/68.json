    "content": "2 FELIX PROFILE ANDY LEVINE\nTHE TRACTION ENGINE\nPeter Lewis Levine has been known as \"Andy\" ever since his schooldays, when someone noticed his resemblance to the film star Andy Devine, and, though for some years he\nused to try to introduce himself as\" Peter\" still, it never worked for long and he has almost given up now.\nAndy entered the chemical engineering department in1951 and, largely on a reputation for hard work built up in his first two\nyears, gained a first class honours degree in1954. Those first two years were spent in comparative obscurity but, after a character building process including attendance at, various hops and carnivals and a trip to Finland in the summer of1953, he entered the Guilds Union Committee as Chairman of the Chem. Eng. Soc. Thus his qualities of persevere n ce, good sense and good humour were\nbrought sufficiently to public notice for his election as C. and G. President, at the remarkably early age of20, last summer.\nWhile he was still at school all interest in sport was quenched, so he tells me, when\nhe was forced to go on across country run, in January, wh i oh involved crossing a partially frozen river; but he did play cricket for the Links Club against the Chaps Club last year and claims to have taken a wicket, though nobody remembers very clearly. Also he has recently tried to give swimming\nlessons on the3 rd floor of\" tn eux d House i, but these lapsed through lack of the right sort of support. Apart from Union affairs and work ( he will be starting research in Chem. Tech. anytime now) his main interests are flying and\nwomen. His is one of the, best known faces in x ne University Air Squadron ed his favourite topic of conversation is aero pj. an.es.\nAs for the second interest he has asked me\nto say nothing, as some of the interested parties are certain to read this. If Andy cannot be found in room 36 ( Old Hostel), Chem. Tech., the I.C. Union Office or the bar, he is probably in a Guilds Union Committee Meeting. He may also be seen at nearly all the Balls and Carnivals but rarely visits a hop - unless he is looking for a new girlfriend, which is quite often as he prefers to eso or this ladies to the theatre or cinema, if he takes them out at NEWS FROM THE S. C.C. The first meeting of the Social Clubs Commltte\ntook place on Monday 2 5 th. October, in the plea sant atmosphere of Committee Room A. Many wise counsellors and familiar voices were missed, and the meeting must have been one of the shortest in the history of the Committee. After discussing a request from the Gliding Club for a tour grant, for travel to Ju go slavia, where the I. C.G.C. wished to be the first British gliders to sweep the Serbian skies, the Committee\npassed on to the Conservative and Socialist Society Constitutions which were given a second reading and duly ratified. After a brief discussion as to the merits and demerits of its own standing orders the Committee\ndecided to hold their next meeting in Dinner Jackets before attending the last dinner of term on Tuesday.December 1 4 th. The Mines' Union now has a steam traction engine.\nThough first mooted over a year ago tt \u2022 idea was\nconsidered seriously only during last te* and a suitable engine purchased a fortnight ago.\nThe question of a 'mascot' has been a hardy per-- rani al at Union meetings. Besides providing ceremonial transport for tha R.S. M. President and\nbeing a useful moral tribal totem, an engine of\nthis type Is felt to be appropriate because of the\nstrong links with the mining industry: at the turn\nof the century traction engines provided the nec--ess ary power for the opening-up of many remote\nmines.\nA child of the industrial nineteenth century, the\ntraction engine has been largely an English jr o duct. Machines were sent out from this country to\nall parts of the world in the 1880's and 1390's. Some, for use in South America, were equipped rl th conveyor belts for feeding grass to the firebox in place of the more usual coal. The Science Museum last year acquired a general\npurpose engine of 1872. This early machine ha* no\ndifferential, the rear wheels being driven from\nthe axle through stout steel pins: to turn a cor ner it was necessary to stop, take out one of\nthe driving pins, and go round the corner with\none w nsa ian ving. ine real fun arose w nen i to a a e to aligning the holes for the pin to be replaced.\nEngines fall into one of three classes:(1) agri cultural engines, used for threshing, ploughing,\nand general haulage work; (2) showmen's engines,\ndesigned for driving fairground machinery and\nhauling it from one site to another (these engines\nare always gaily painted, with burnished brass work and dynamo fitted on the smoke-box); and (3) road\nlocomotives, used for road haulage. For this last type of work, John Fowler's of Leeds produced a standard model weighing 17 tons. At the other ex-- tsetse, many manufacturers produced engines of\nfive or six tons.\ni The Mines' engine weighs 6 i tons loaded and was\nmade in1919 by A vel lng and Porter of Rochester\n( all their engines carry the white Horse 'Invlcta'\nof Kent). It has solid rubber tyres which s nou ld be a great advantage round London. Boiler pressure\nis200 lb/ in2. To stop in a hurry the steam regulator is shifted to apply steam to both sides of the pistons, thus ef fec xiv ely locking them. Two\nspeed gears are fitted, the engine needing to be\nstationary in order to change. An endearing habit\nof steam contrivances that Interested spectators\nshould be warned about is 'priming'. When this occurs, water that has accumulated in the cylinders is suddenly shot up the chimney where it picks up large quantities of soot before descend-ing onto the surrounding observers. You have\nbeen warned I The Mines' Union intends to run the engine (she\nis as yet un-named; suggestions would be welcomed)\nto ceremonial functions such as Morphy Day, and\nalso to take part in some of the rallies that are\nheld outside London. Although a relative youngster\nas regards both weight and age, her six tons should\narouse a little respect. It is NOT desired to fl aunt her as an aggressive and provoking means of\nattack on other colleges but use her rather as a sedate and respectable member of the Union. May she\nlong remain on amicable terms with Boanerges, even\nif at times there some friendly rivalry between\nthem.\nBecause of the upheaval of rebuilding in South\nKensington she is to live at Harlington for the\npresent.\n\n"

Cup Competition at the expense\nof N.E.C. on Sat. 6th November. On a dull, miserable day, when the conditions were all against good football the I.C. team proved them-selves worthy winners with a score of5 goals\nto 1.\nThe game began with the play quite even on\nboth sides with each team attacking vigour ou sly, although I.C. looked the more likely to score.\nHowever, with the condition very treacherous\nunderfoot it took some time for the teams to mast er the difficulties. I.C. were the first to do\nso and after several near misses the home team\ntook the lead with a goal scored by Hodge.\nAt halftime the score was still10 but with\nmore accurate shooting N.E.C. might have had to face a bigger deficit. I.C. were now in the\nascendancy and playing as a team with every man\ndoing his job very well, and it only seemed to be\na matter of time before more goals would oom e. But in one of N.E.C.' a sporadic raids on the I.C. goal the equalise r came after a mix up amongst\nthe I.C. defenders. This produced great consternation amongst the four valiant supporters who\nhad visions of the preliminary round when the result was undecided until the last few minutes.\nThe equal ising goal had an amazing effect on\nthe I.C. team. They pulled their socks up and\ngoals then came at regular intervals until the\nend of the match. N.E.C. could not cope with a much fitter and faster team and they fell to pieces, hodge cOmpleted'a nat uric x ana ure en also added a goal whilst one of the N.E.C. def ender s had the misfortune to put through his own\ngoal.

After losing three members from last year's1st team another lean season was expected. However, with a fresher, Bra i thwaite, playing well at No. 3\u00bb and a considerably improved Mark Abbott\nat 5\n> the prospects look somewhat brighter.

    "content": "5\nNOV. 5\u2122 -THE PAST\nIn these days of highly-organised Guy Fawkes\n-Celebrations it is good to look back to at in e when\na conflagration was only obtained in the teeth of\npolice resistance. Take 1949 for example. the first fire on the Albert Memorial steps was not a success.\nThough wood was being put on at a greater rate than\nits removal by the many police on the scene, a fire work exploding in the^cid dle of i to lew it out. Two fires were then started on either side of a smoke\nscreen, and -whilst the police were putting one out. the\nother thrived until only the Fire Brigade could deal\nwith it. This duly came, but retired after a look,\nto await reinforcements. Ther followed an exhibition\nof pyrotechnics, burning Guys, and deep and muffled\nexplosions that shook Albert visibly, the Fire Bri gade returned, and after a pitched battle in which\na hose was nearly won for the Union, water was turned\non to the crowd, and the fire put out. Dispossessed\nstudents then entered the main road and showed pass ive resistance to the traffic, which had to be diverted for two hours.\nResult : Loss of 16 students and gain of umpteen\nhelmets. The spot is now commemorated by a chipped\nkerbs tone on the upper road wi y. BO'\n\" Boanerges\" commonly known a s\"3o\" is the official transport of Guilds' President, and\nis used on all occasions where_ a town carriage is required Lord Mayor's Day, Morphy Day, Engineers' Cup, Field Cup, and so on. The car belongs to Guild's Union and the Motor Club are trustees.\"30\" is a James and Browne car, built in \u2022Hammersmith in1902.52 years of motoring and\nstill going strong! The car is a horizontal parallel twin of13 hp( about2 litres). It has a four speed gearbox and final chain drives to the back wheel. Tumbler coils give a terrific spark. There are brakes in there a rw neel s only. Braking is generally surprisingly good, but last week one brake rod broke when\npulling up, for a policeman, behind a car that st on ped sharply. Bo did not stop! This is not the first Bo. Boanerges I was a single cylinder Rover made in1905. When the RAC\ntightened up on the3 right on Run rules in1933, eliminating all cars built after1904, Bo I was\nsold and Bo II acquired in his pla oe the following year. Bo II came from a blacksmith in Shropshire. He went on all the Brighton runs up to the war,\nand every one since. He came out from his wartime retirement in1946. On the Brighton Run of1949 he was disqualified for speeding, arriving there first! Last year Bo got there notwithstanding the rain. This year's run is on Sunday and Bo\nwill be there as usual. In1939 Bo lapped the mountain LAH circuit at Brook lands at29 m.p.h. it is not recorded how far up the By fleet banking he went. Finally, could someone tell me - what is Bo's sex?

Could I add my plea for a better selection of records. Most of the vocal numbers have no discern able rhythm at all and are hence\nimpossible to even attempt to dance to. Could we\nplease have a few more strict tempo numbers, when\nperhaps fewer people would be seen struggling to\nwaltz or foxtrot to a quickstep tune.\nYours Faithfully, I.G. HacBean.\nDear Sir, How many of us smiled scornfully when we\nread the wording on our Guy Fawkes hop tickets? But in the shame of our ignorance we could not\nknow that what seemed to us a childish spelling error was Instead an adult subtlety of word, a nuance of meaning, that our guiding light, our Un-ion. had thought fit to reveal to us.\nTHEY did not need to seek the Shorter\nOxford to know that. BUSS ( bi iS), search. and dial.1570 meant a kiss. From 7 p.m. these sweet greetings of the lips were\nto be free; and in our hearts we i thanked) THEM for allowing us the chance, If we were early, to capture\nJust-one wind blown buss before it soared to Autumn's starry heavens.\nI remain, Sir, your obedient servant\n\u2022A Humble Ignoramus'.\nRoyal School of Mines,\n1st November 1954.\nThe Editor,\" Felix\". Dear Sir,I must register a strong protest at the inconsistency in the supply of the beef and yeast\nextract, M rm-t( to the New Lounge Snack Bar.\nWhenever possible, my lunch-time diet consists of\nsix or eight sandwiches filled with this precious foodstuff. It is on this, and a daily quota of\nbla ok beer, that I depend for the energy and\nstamina that is required for the st reno us course\nfor which the School of Mines is noted.\nAlas, Sir, every three weeks or so, the supply of M rm-tin the snack bar runs out and it is often a week before the stock is replenished. I hope that through publication in your esteemed\nJournal, this deplorable state of affairs i a rectified. Yours faithfully Ravenous Jack.45, E ard ley Crescent, London, S. W.5as from Imperial College. To The Editor of\" Felix\". Dear Sir, The recent appeal in your columns for responsibility in the handling of fireworks a tH arlington passed by almost unnoticed. May I, who had the doubtful honour of being the first victim, sincerely thank those who helped me in any way, particularly the two gentlemen who\nextracted the shrapnel from my foot. Yours faithfully, ri y lton Booth roy d( Maths. Ill) Imperial College,\nNov.7th. Dear Sir, Despite overcrowding, the Guy Fawkes\ncelebrations passed off reasonably successfully. However, I think that their organisation should\nbe altered for future years. I do not see why,\nJust because the function is held at Harlington,\nthe brunt of the work involved should be borne\nby officials of the athletic clubs, who already\nhave their hands full. This year, for example, the Soccer Club\nhad their1 st round cup match on Saturday, Nov.6th, and had arranged a practice match on the previous\nWednesday. It seems most unfair that the officials of the soccer club were burdened with the resp-on sibi lit y of building the fire a very consid-er able task which they performed very well -during this* crucial period. In fact tha Captain\nhad to miss nearly all the Trial Match which was\nconsequently almost useless. The Rugger and Hock-ey officials also with Cup Matches approaching\n- were similarly obliged to carry out tasks\nwhich could well have been performed by people\nwith less responsibility already in their hands.\nI suggest that in future the whole affair should be run by a Guy Fawkes committee which sho\n-ul d consist largely of those people who otherwise contribute little to the Union, but who al ways turn up to such functions as this. Even the clearing up on Saturday morning\nwas left to about a dozen people, mostly aem--be rs of the Rugger Club. When an attempt was\nmade to persuade people to help with this on the\nprevious night, a profusion of absurd excuses\nwas offered, of which the most abysmal was \"work--ing\"I Whether the whole affair is worth the\nvery considerable expense which it entails, Just \u2022\nto keep I.C. students off the London streets, Is\nanother problem. Personally I think the money\nInvolved - a aid to be about a hundred pounds -could be put to a better purpose.\nYours sincerely, A. Kitchener.\nI.C. Union.30 th October1954 Dear Sir, On Road Safety Posters we read of a race of\npeople so silly that we doubt their existence. The other day I met a car in Prince Consort Road, orI should say it ran into me and threw me\nout of its way with remarkable force and efficiency. I do not advise stopping cars this way,\nthough it worked, the driver soon being beside me.\nIt is not the most comfortable way and very humi-lia ting. When one fully realises what a clot one has\nbeen, somebody usually has to rub it into bring you down a peg and put themselves up two. Might I therefore thank the driver, workmen and in particular the staff of the New Lounge who helped me\nwith smiles, sympathy and strong, sweet tea (no\ncharge). Not even a student cursed me and I think I learnt my lesson better without it, thanks again to them.\nThe moral is, I suppose, \"Judge not\" but I write because we often forget the kindness and\nhelpfulness of the Refectory staff, examples of which,I have seen so often. Yours etc., Robert B. Palmer.\nEvening Dress\nAFT IO/6 Double\nTHE ENGINEERS BALL FRIDAY 26th NOVEMBER\n' 8 jam. to 2 am.\n\n"

Guy Fawkes Day a tH arlington was one of the noisiest, most crowded, yet enjoyable College fu notions most people o an remember.\nEveryone seemed to be there. A conservative est i mate of the numbers was 850. During the few days before the5 th tickets were sold out twice, and at Friday lunchtime the queues for the Snack Bar and\nfor Guy Fawkes t ioke ts became gloriously mingled. The air was slightly foggy that evening and\nfumes from fireworks, bonfires and the barbecuing pig all mingled. The official firework display and bonfire followed the usual pattern, supported of course by\nmany individual efforts. FELIX is surprised to find that no-one has claimed the Biggest Bang;\njudging by the number of attempts heard between9.00 and 10.00 we rather ought to give a free copy to the people who didn't try. Mohody managed to shoot down the President's balloon, not even the unofficial R.C.S. firing squad. They stationed themselves immediately underneath the balloons and even then were only able to s evert ne strings of one bunch of three. The barbecued pig was well and truly cooked. Mr. Mooney dealt with this without any previous experience; perhaps we shall be having mass bur be ou es for lunch from now on! The tastiest tit,bits were found in the fire afterwards. Eating' t nem from a garden fork just added to the glamour of the evening.

REFECTORY COMMITTEE\nThe 1 1 8 th Meeting' of the Refectory Committee was. held on Monday, October25 th. Apart from the routine business mu oh was\ndiscussed which should be of general interest to the Union. In particular the question of overcrowding at lunch hours was brought up\n.and discussed extensively. The general feeling was that everything possible should be\n'done to relieve the congestion. To this end1, the suggestion of some sort of staggering of lunch hours would be refered to the Board of Studies. The Wine List has been completed and\nprinted and a full cellar is be in&laid down.\nMr. Neale had plenty of things to say about that institution so near to our hearts, the Bar. In particular, in view of its imminent move to temporary quarters and the necessary designing of new premises, he felt that customers should have the choice of, higher quality grades of beer. In conclusion the Committee all agreed that the Refectory finances were now in a very happy state, due almost entirely to the endeavours of Mr. Mooney. He was to be\ncongratulated on his success, and it. was\nexpected that this year the financial loss on\nthe Refectory would be completely eliminated.

SEELEY Circulation:1 \u00b000\nMost people who were at H arlington for this year's November 5th. will agree with us that it was the best organised Guy Fawkes night they o an remember. An Interesting comparison o an be made\nwith the article \"November 5th. The Past.\" on\npage 5. It seems as though with the pronouncements of U.L. Senate, and of our own. Authorities, that kind of November 5th. has gone. As long as\nI.C., Union Executive o an organise evenings like this last one a tH arlington, nobody should be\nsorry,' exo ep t those irresponsible people who want\nto get themselves arrested to complete an evening'a entertainment. No other Colleges attempted\neither to crash in on our bonfire, or our Union buildings; and as far as we know no I.C. men tried to do the same to anyone else's bonfire. We o an confidently expect that on future occ-as ions when, the Union requires really good entertainment, it will be provided by our own Union\nofficers and Executive. We would like to extend\nour thanks to all those people who made Nov. 5th.,1954 such a happy evening.\nSo in e Mines have got their Traction Engine\nat last.

If only\nthose who wanted to wear them, wore the rn, the public would at last know that University Students throng the streets of South Ken sing ton. Unfortunately it seems v.e require some\nreason for wearing them. Many of us have been so weighty in our opinions, obscuring the simple reason for wearing academic ci res s. question1 u ao on s^ der \u00bb on \u00b0 e and for all, t ne We are, by definition, University students and are therefore entitled to wear gowns\nJn like some other colleges we are not, fortunately, oom pelle d to wear them. Therefore,\nshould we do so it is through our own will and because we are proud to be students of\nImperial College. Make no mistake! I to an be easily shown that we have every right to\nbe most proud of everything concerning our\nposition as students of I.C. Firstly, of ourselves. By personal effort each one of us has earned the right to\nbe called a student of I.C. and a member of\none of the greatest Universities in the world.\nWe work while we are hero, hard and with long hours. All of us have to cope with special problems wh i oh affect our work.\nSecondly, our own College. In addition,\nto a deserved fine academic reputation, it has a Union. A Union, organised by our-selves, where we o an develop our particular interests and .which has made the word\n\"Imperial\" respected throughout the Clubs and\nSocieties of our University, and beyond.\nWe have every reason to show our pride in being students - and students of Imperial College. A gown is easily obtained, and is relatively cheap considering it is hand-made. On,\ni leaving college It may be sold to defray parti of the initial cost. It is interesting that most students have their blue college blazers tailor-made. An ordinary blazer of the same\nquality( with I.C. badge) and a gown,oost s less than a tailored blazer. A gown is black and therefore seldom requires cleaning! It is also an excellent overall, pinafore and\nI dust sheet exo ep t where moving machinery is I he ing used in the Lab, when the gown should ,\nJbe taken off and hung on a peg. .\nIt is not regimentation, neither is it snobbery to wear, of our own freewill, a gown - it is our deserved privilege. Let us use this privilege whilst we have the\nbrief opportunity.\nK.K. Dent.\nCASSANDRA SPEAKS AGAIN\nCassandra is glad that her last article made\nfewer enemies than usual.
