    "content": "Page 10 FELIX 9th October, 1969\nFRESHERS' DAY\nI.C. SLEEP-IN\nUntil May, 1969, the UL lodgings bureau had a policy\nwhich invited racial discrimination among landladies. After a long discussion on how to handle the situation which would\nprobably ensue, ULU Presidents Council said that this policy\nmust end. Lodgings bureau landladies in the West London\narea were asked to accept the new policy; only 10% agreed.\nICU's amateur bureau has been working reasonably well,\nbut the situation was still rough on Freshers' Day, so the\nPresident, Piers Corbyn, arranged for the Union Upper\nLounge to be made available to homeless students. So on\nMonday might the fight against racial is m was carried into\nICU by six \u2022students, who slept comfortably on the thick\ncarpet to be welcomed at 0.7.30 by the cleaners. The sleep-in\ncontinued throughout the week with a transient batch of\nbetween 8 and 4 happy (?) students. (But were there more on\nSouthside floors ?) The sleepers interspersed their slumbers\nwith j olli ties with the cleaners in the morning and trips to\nSouth Ken Wimpy Bar at night.\nOur activities could be more positively anti-racial if ICU\nappointed a Lodgings officer Who had time to discuss with\nthe landlords the question of racial is m \u2014something the UL Lodgings Bureau refuses to do anything about.\nPOST-GRAD GRANTS\nAt present the majority of past-graduate students receive\nan annual grant of \u00a3530 from the Science Research Council.\nAs reported elsewhere in FELIX the A.S.T.M. S. has recently\ngained a salary increase related by a job evaluation exercise\nto the work the technician is actually doing.\nIt might be a good idea to have the same evaluation applied\nto post-graduate earnings. Any sensible evaluation should\nlead to a salary vastly greater than that now received. \u00a31250\nper annum is not unreasonable with annual increments of\n\u00a3100 and a London allowance of \u00a3125.\nAfter all, post-graduate work should be right for the\ncommunity and the results of research evaluated and\nutilised properly. If a person doing research is to feel a full\nsense of belonging to the community as a whole and to feel\nthat his work is worthwhile he should be paid on a par with\nother full time university qualified workers, not be treated as\na cheap method of doing advanced and necessary work.\nEven the present government puts university finance under\nthe social service sector of the economy instead of moving it\nto the more reasonable investment sector\u2014surely research\nand education is an investment if ever there was one.\nIn the 1964 National Plan universities were going to have\ntheir costs linked with school milk and the infamous \"imputed\nrent\"\u2014money that the government would have if it had built\nflats instead of schools and universities.\nUniversities now have an allotted sum\u2014that left over when\nthe other social services have been accounted for. The attitude towards post-graduate grants seems to be that the universities can certainly give p.g' s more grants but the number of\np.g' s must decrease accordingly to keep the allocation con-s tant. This is obviously ridiculous.\nFurthermore Her Majesty's Opposition has seriously\nmooted the idea of further debasing research by introducing\nloans for post-graduate students. This would only have the\ndetrimental effect of lowering standards, productivity and of\ncourse ensuring that still more students go abroad to study.\nAs long as p.g' s continue to acquiesce in the present situ a tion, however, there can be little hope of an improvement.\nThis year's fresher s had the\nusual introduction to I.C. on\nfresher s day: a meeting in\nthe Royal Geographical\nSociety headquarters in Exhibition Road. There were,\nhowever, a number of breaks\nwith tradition: President\nPiers Corbyn refused to wear\na suit or academic gown,\nthere were none of the pathetic jokes Which every other\ngroup of fresher s has had to\nendure, (there were no\nspeeches from the constituent\nCollege Presidents, their\nplaces being taken over by\nthe Welfare, External Affairs\nand Academic Officers.\nThe meeting was opened\nby the Rector, who started\nhis speech with a series of\nStatistics about the college.\nHe went on to explain die\nprogress of the College expansion programme, which is\nnow 75 % completed with just\nthe Chemistry and Maths\nbuildings to come. Lord\nPenney followed this with a description of the area in the\nColege block common to\nstaff and students (see page\n4).\nThe Rector finished by\nemphasising the importance\nof joining Clubs and societies,\nand said he thought anyone\nwho spent his whole University career doing academic\nwork would not be gaining\nall he could from his stay\nhere.\nPiers Corbyn (then introduced the Union officials\npresent, and delivered his\nwelcoming speech, the greater\npart of which dealt With the\nacademic nature of I.C. He\nstarted by suggesting that the\neducation given at any University is designed only to\nproduce graduates for indus-try, where they will become\nan integral part of the\neconomy. Speaking about I.C. specifically Piers dismissed\nthe idea that we have an academic community; according\nto his way of thinking an\nacademic community implies\nsocial equality between all\nsections of the College, and\nan atmosphere of free and\ncritical discussion. He felt\nthat alt I.C. an academic\ncommunity did not exist\nsince students had no real\ninfluence in the direction of\nthe path which I.C. is taking.\nTo produce a real academic\ncommunity the President\nthought that the students\nshould have m and a table representation on the Governing body and on the smaller\nbut more important Finance\nand Executive Committee of\nthis Body.\nMr. Corbyn went on to disclose the results of a survey\nheld last year which showed\nthat 96% of undergraduates\nwanted some non-technical\nsubjects as part of their\ndegree course. He expressed\na hope that the authorities, in\ndiscussion with the Students\nUnion, Would introduce the\nchanges necessary to introduce broader courses.\nThe President concluded by\nsaying that this was an important year for the Union,\nand that there were many\nimportant issues coming up\nfor discussion, concerned\nwith both the Union itself\nand its relation with other\ngroups. He felt that in all\ndiscussions and negotiations\nthe fresher s would find that\nit is not rules or requests\nwhich really decide things\u2014it\nis the balance of forces \u2014\nwhich means our ability to\norganise ourselves and act to-get her. After a few words from the\nother speakers, the fresher s moved off to a reception in\ntheir own departments.\nDO YOU WANT TO GET TO\nKNOW PEOPLE ?\nCAN YOU\nWRITE?\nTAKE PHOTOGRAPHS ?\nTYPE?\nBE AN IDEAS MAN ?\nIF SO\nJOIN FELIX NOW\nCome to Press Meetings Every Tuesday\nand Thursday, 12.45.\nPress Room, Union Top Floor\nat\n3LC on October 11th Tickets will be on sale in the Union Cloakroom.\nPOETS PERFORM\nThe incomparable Barrow\npoets treated I.C. students to\na further selection of their\nown distinctive brand of\npoetry, humour and music\nduring General Studies on\nThursday, Oct. 2nd. This was their seventh visit\nto I.C. and the poets are fast\nbecoming a regular feature of\ngeneral studies. They were\nvery enthusiastically received\nby a large gathering in the\nUnion lower lounge, and\nwent straight into their act,\nbeginning with a comic duo-logue between two men at an\nart gallery and proceeding\nthrough a welter of music old\nand new intermingled with\npoetry from al eras.\nThe bulk of the recitation\nwas carried by William\nBealby-Wright and Gerard\nBenson, who also joined in\nthe music making with various odd-looking and odd-sounding instruments.\nThe Barrow poets first appeared in 1951, going around\nthe London pubs reciting\nDRAM SOC This coming year should\nbe a big one for the Dramatic\nSociety \u2014DRAMSOC. Each\nyear we do three productions,\none each term.

The A.S.T.M. S. claimed\na10 per cent salary increase. They are now pleased to say\nthat they have gained a7 per cent increase composed of\na4.4 per cent interim increase and a further 2.6 per cent\npart payment for any salary increase arising from a\" job\nevaluation exercise\" to be run under the guidance of the\nManpower and Productivity Service of the Department of\nEmployment and Productivity.\nThe aim of the exercise is to produce a factual report\non the jobs that the universities technical staff actually do.\nThe exercise, taking place at Imperial College from October\n13th to 17th, will be supervised by a college monitoring\ncommittee consisting of two from I.C., two from A.S.T.M. S., and a chairman from the Manpower Services. In each\ndepartment there will be a committee of two\u2014an A.S.T.M. S. representative and the Head of Department. Each member\nof the technical staff will be interviewed by one of 17 field\nworkers, composed of postgraduates from other colleges paid\na fee of \u00a35 per day plus expenses. The interviews will last for\nabout an hour and a half and there will also be a confidential\nquestionnaire to fill in.\nIf the whole exercise is completed by April 1970 as hoped\nfor, it will be an outstanding achievement as similar\nexercises in the motor industry have taken up to two years.\nOn completion negotiations for further salary increases will\nstart again, backdated incidentally to April 1969.

Despite\nthe extreme thinness of the\nexcuse, the darkness was\naccepted in silence (and dark-ness) by the vast throng and\nalso by the large audience.\nThis revered period of abstinence from light was just\none of the many totally irreverent and irrelevant happenings at the meeting. It was\nfollowed by several amusing\nsketches by well-known\nRCSU personalities. As they\ndid not appear to need to use\na script, one must draw the\ninescapable conclusion that\nsuch behaviour is normal to\nthem ! The standard of the\nfun side of the meeting was\nconsiderably improved upon\nlast year.\nEarlier on, the various\nUnion officials addressed the\npacked lecture theatre and\nexplained to the fresher s the\nworkings of RCSU and its\nThe first thing about the\norganisation is that we are\nnot really a club or society.\nWe have no formal meetings,\nexcept the Obligatory general\nmeetings, no entry fee, in\nfact not really any members\n\u2014just helpers. At the mom-ent, some would doubt that\nwe even have any organ is a tion, as two of the committee\nmembers did not satisfy their\nexaminers and another is\nnews editor for Felix. However, organisation is our\nraison d'e tre. If anyone wants\nto spend time helping others,\nwe try to provide the opportunity or put them in touch\nwith someone who can.\nPerhaps the most spectacular of our activities are the\nte gular bloOd do ning sessions.\nAnyone who has seen these\ngoing on must realise how\nmuch work they require.\nHowever, Mood is often\nneeded quickly, so we also\norganise an emergency\nscheme, with volunteers from\nthe Halls of Residence.\nWork Parties\nWork parties are another\nof our activities. At week-ends, groups of three or four\ngo off to decorate a room in\nNotting Hill\u2014often for an\nold widow living alone in\njust that one room. If this is\nso, we put her on top of her\nfurniture at one end of the\nroom, while we start at the\nother. It soon becomes apparent that everybody assumed\nthat someone else knew how\nto hang paper. A little later,\nit generally turns out that\nanyone who puts his scientific\ntraining to it can turn out a pretty good job.

These\nspeeches, the only serious\npart of the meeting, were\ngenerally very straight for ward, and should go a long\nway towards introducing the\nnewcomers to RCSU.\nAt the end of the meeting,\nthe only long-haired skin-but it usually turns out that\non Sunday afternoon, four\ngood friends wash their\nbrushes and rearrange the\nfurniture in a bright new\nroom.\nOdd things have been\nknown to happen. I remember one young lady who was\nsent out by three men on\nSunday afternoon to buy a packet of razor blades!\nHelp for the Blind\nHave you ever wondered\nwhat would happen if you\nwere blinded tomorrow? For\nsome young men and women\nthe courageous answer was\nto take up physiotherapy. To\nqualify they must reach A level standard in physics and\nknow a great deal of anatomy and physiology. Some\nof us go every week to read\ntext books to them. For those\nwho cannot manage such a regular commitment we need\nhelp tape recording books for\nthe Royal Normal College\nfor the blind. Grundig gene r head Butty in captivity attempted to sneak out without a rendition of a Kangela.\nHe (it?) was quickly brought\nback to \" do his thing \", but\nsince the fresher s had not\nbeen taught the words, the\naudience reaction was not\noverwhelming in volume.\nou sly gave us a tape recorder,\nso that anyone with half an\nhour to spare can help.\nEvery so often we are\nasked to visit an old person.\nThey would usually like\nsomeone to go regularly, to\ntalk to them over a cup of\ntea and relieve their lone li ness. Although we operate a rota, they appreciate the continuity of regular visitors.\nYouth work is another of\nour activities, normally\nthrough a youth club.

    "content": "9th October, 1969 FELIX Page 9\nSports Felix Edited by\nJohn Darley\nHockey Squash\nEDITORIAL\nIn previous years it has been customary for the chairman\nof clubs committees to speak at the fresher s reception. This\nyear however, it was decided that there were more urgent\nmatters with which to bore the fresher s and the more mundane affairs of college life could not be mentioned. I should\nlike to take this opportunity, therefore, of welcoming fresher s to the college and point out that although there may be many\nthings wrong with IC in the field of student participation etc,\nthere are many things for which IC is rightly respected, not\nleast of which is our sporting tradition.\nIt is fair to say that for many years now IC teams have,\nif not dominated, at least strongly challenged other London\ncolleges in all fields of sporting activity. If the initial enthusiasm shown on Freshers day and at the first trials can\nbe maintained there is no reason to suppose that this\nchallenge will fail this year.\nWith about 200 fresher s attending trials at Harlington\nit is clear that there will be no shortage of players for the\nrugby, football and hockey teams. ICWA hockey club, in\nfact, suddenly found itself with a regular team and is now\nlooking for regular fixtures.\nOther clubs were also well supported on fresher s day and\nit is hoped that the boat club and cross country clubs will\nhave yet another successful season. Elsewhere on this page\nyou will hear of the prospects and hopes of various ACC\nclubs and I should like to wish every club a successful and,\njust as important, an enjoyable year's sport.\nCricket\nThe cricket club ended an undistinguished season\nwith an undistinguished tour \u2014 at least as far as results\ngo. Although 7 matches were lost out of 9, the standard\nof play remained high. This in part due to the fact that\nresults were only of secondary importance, \u2014 though another\ndefeat by the LSE wasn't too welcome.\nFor the benefit of newcomers, we tour Devon, playing\nlocal Clubs around Plymouth and Torquay. It is the highlight of the season, offering an all too welcome relief from\nexams. During the early part of the season we try to run\nabout 4 XI's, every Wednesday and Saturday. Including\nthe tour this adds up to about 30 matches a season!\nNevertheless, we have found that the shortness of the\nsummer term and the pre-o coup ation with exams then tends\nto interfere with cricket. For this reason we run nets during\nthe winter at AM Gover's cricket school in East Putney on\nSundays, so that the club can get settled down before the\nseason proper starts. If you play any kind of cricket, we\nwould advise you to join now rather than wait until summer,\nbecause besides offering coaching facilities, the school is\nan excellent social club. It is well worth joining for this alone.\nIf you wish to play at all and we haven't got your name\nyet, get in touch with Tony Furling, 28 Weeks or Russ\nSmith, Maths 2.\nBadminton\nThe Badminton club (annual subscription 12/6) runs three\nmen's teams, one mixed and one ladies' team. There is club\nplay on Monday evenings (ladies), Wednesday afternoons,\nand Saturday and Sunday mornings in -the Gym. The club\ncaters for players of all standards, from the complete beginner to the player with many seasons of experience behind\nhim.\nThe home courts are no longer at Nine Elms Baths, but\nhave moved to Wimbledon Baths, which open on October\n15th.(I must hasten to add that we play on a covered pool\n\u2014 sub-aqua badminton has yet to reach its peak of\npopularity.) These courts will mainly be used for team\nmatches, but will be available for club play when there are\nno fixtures.\nWith the exception of last season, when the mixed team\nput the rest of us to shame, the first men's and mixed teams\nhave had an enormously successful record, having won the\nULU Division I championships for as long as student memory\ngoes back.\nThe intake of new members includes at least one county\nand one ULU player, and there is every prospect that the\nclubs is returning to its former playing strength.\nPhil Poyser\nLast year's football team in action at Harlington\nFootball\nWith over 90 names taken on fresher s day, the Soccer Club\nis hoping to field several strong sides this season. Freshers\ntrials were held last Wednesday and with such a large number of players present it was difficult to assess them all.\nHowever, several promising players have already emerged.\nIt is evident that with such strong competition for places all\nteams should be able to maintain a high standard.\nThe final trials on Saturday last (including last year's players) simplified selection of the teams for the opening\nmatches yesterday.\nThis has been a promising start to the season and provided\nthis support for all the teams continues the club looks forward to a very successful season. Tom McCardle\nRugby\nAs most fresher s will have\nbeen bombarded by anti-Rugby Club literature during their short stay here so\nfar, it might be a good idea\nto show the other (perhaps\nmore realistic) side of our\nreactionary, alcoholic, anti-Left-wing image.\nThe RFC is one of the\noldest of IC clubs and is\nthus, by definition, steeped\nin tradition; perhaps this is\nwhy it has been the target\nfor such a dramatic smear\ncampaign of late.\nInjuries\nFor many years IC\ndominated London college\nrugby, but last season\u2014due\nmainly to gross bad luck and\nunfortunate injuries to vital\nteam members \u2014 we suffered a few losses. However, this season, with 60\nnew members in the club,\nprospects look bright both\non the playing and on the\nsocial side. While the main\naim of the 1st XV will be to\nwin the Gutteridge cup\n(played for amongst London\ncolleges) once again, the\nother 6 XVs will be striving\nto maintain their fine records\nof being successful on and\nespecially off the field.\nRemember that the Club\nis the most socially minded\nin IC \u2014 it cannot be beaten\nfor the sense of fellowship\nits members enjoy; this goes\nfar deeper than its often\nattacked bar image.\nMike Adams\nWater Polo\nThe Water Polo Club this\npast summer explored the\ndepths of darkest Devon.\nThe team's spartan discipline\nwas sorely tried by the miscellaneous vices rife in the\nTorquay YMCA, but, inspired by the example of the\nmoral guardian, Mr.\nSpooner its members' sobriety was matched only by\ntheir willingness to train in\nthe 53\u00b0C water.\nWater temperature proved\nto be a crucial factor in the\nteam's success. In warm\nwater pools at Brixham and\nExeter emphatic victories of\n14-2 and 10-0 were recorded,\nwhereas at Devonport, in a pool at 56\u00b0C we were lucky\nto obtain a55 draw after\nbeing 3-0 up after the first\nquarter. It is thought that\nthis temperature effect was\ndue to excessive loss of body\nheat in passing Swedish\nschoolgirls in Torquay. The\nlast match, against the\nDevon county champions,\nExmouth, in the international pool there, produced some very fine polo,\nand some very imaginative\nrefereeing. IC defeated' Exmouth by 6-4. The result of\nthe match between IC and\nthe referee was a decided\nvictory for the latter.\nSo the tour was, on the\nwhole, very successful, with\nno defeats and one very\ngood and unexpected win in\nthe last match. Needless to\nsay, the virulence of the\ncider of Devon revenged any\nembarrassment caused to its\npolo players.\nJohn McGarrity\nThe fresher s' trial was\nheld on Wednesday 1st October, and was attended\nby about 30 people. This\nwas not as many as had\nbeen expected, and it is to\nbe hoped that the absentees\nhave not been overcome by\nacademic work at this early\nstage of the term.\nThose who attended were\nable to take part in two or\nthree games during the afternoon on the pitches which\nhave been used during the\nlong vac. for both an International match between the\nWorld champions Pakistan,\nand the England U.23 XI,\nand a game between an\nEngland XI and the Middlesex county XL There were several\npromising newcomers to IC\nhockey who made their\ndebut at the trials, and\ncoupling this with the fact\nthat 5 members of last years\n1st XI have returned to\ncollege we should have a strong 1st XI this year.\nHowever, anyone who\nfeels that he is not of 1st team calibre need not worry\nsince we are hoping to run\n5 elevens on Saturday this\nyear, so there will be plenty\nof hockey for anyone who\nwants it.\nAnyone who wants to play\nand has not yet been contacted should see one of the\nclub officers listed below.\nCaptain: Mike Burtt: Falmouth 244.\nFixture Secretary: J.

    "content": "Page 6 FELIX 9th October, 1969\nTWO KINDS OF POP MUSIC A Biased Look at Modern Music in some of its Manifestations\nIf we believe what our ears and eyes tell us, pop music is\nnow becoming respectable. The evidence is all around, in\nthe newspapers, on the radio and television, and in the\nmagazines that clutter the book stalls. Just before the start of the session the Deep Purple/\nRoyal Philharmonic Orchestra concert was given a great\ndeal of advance publicity as something new in the music\nworld, when only a few years ago such an idea would have\nbeen thought ludicrous. The fact remains: some of the older\ngeneration are now condescending to take the younger\ngeneration's music seriously. Tony Palmer has been the\nfirst reviewer to take pop music as something more than\njust an idle entertainment for the young; his regular column\nin the Observer points out both its faults and its virtues\nwithout ever taking a paternalistic attitude.\nNow the Sunday Times produces its \"jazz/pop\" column\nand occasionally deigns to remove some \"jazz\" to make way\nfor a little \"pop\" to be reviewed; almost all the daily newspapers run a weekly feature including brief record reviews\nnot all singles, thankfully \u2014 as well as the inevitable top\nten chart and some sort of gossip column about \"pop per-son ali ties\". The business is booming, glowing under its\nnewly acquired halo of respectability.\nBut even the most enthusiastic pop fan would admit it\nis a halo undeserved by the greater part of the business.\nPop music is just a label used by most people to describe any\nkind of music not classifiable as jazz or classical, it can be\ndivided and subdivided into many different kinds of music.\nMainly, however, there are two kinds of pop. There is pop\nmusic you buy as L.P.s and hear in the record shops, and\nthere is pop music you hear on the radio (apologies to John\nPeel) and buy as singles at extortionate prices. Sadly, it\nis the latter which gets all the playing time on radio and\ntelevision.\nThe former have taken on various other labels in an\nattempt to dissociate themselves from the \"teeny bopper\" groups but people still call them pop groups because a great\ndeal of their exponents started off as small-time pop groups\nin the '63-'66 era when groups were the big fashion. In\nthose days they made their living by having a single released\nwhich was pushed into the charts by some enterprising record\ncompany, and the resulting publicity was enough for them\nto be signed up for one-night stands and dances for the\nnext few months. A great deal of the groups disappeared\nalmost as soon as they had been created but some kept on,\ndisregarded the hit parade and started producing albums of\ntheir own material \u2014 some good, some bad, but almost all\noriginal. They progressed but the word \"progressive\" has\nbecome a word almost of abuse used by pop fans who\nfind themselves unable to understand music produced by\nthe \"underground\" music faction.\nAnyone who watches \"Top of the Pops\" every week\nwill recognise the average teeny bopper group. Three or four\npeople, if that is the right name for them, stand idly\nstrumming guitars, fingers hardly moving on the strings,\nsomeone \u2014 or something \u2014 else apathetically brushes the\ntop of a drum with a drumstick, perhaps there's an organ\nor a string less piano for realism, while a gibbering transvestite hops around at the front of the stage waving a microphone about. Somewhere, you can hear an orchestra playing.\nIt is no wonder that the average age of the 45-rpm-record\nbuyer is about twelve or thirteen, especially considering the\ncost of singles today.\nNevertheless, it is the youngsters who put records in\nthe hit-parade who have controlled a great deal of the\ntrends in modern music. The groups whose records regularly\ntop the L.P. charts readily admit that a great deal of their\nsuccess relied on publicity they received appearing on tele-vision, and the few available television record shows all deal\nexclusively with the singles market. On the other hand,\nduring the past year, BBC 2 produced \"Colour me Pop\"\nwhich has done a great deal to further the recognition of\nmany progressive pop groups, and groups like Led Zeppelin,\nFairport Convention, Chickenshack have all had very good\nalbum sales without the benefit of a successful single.\nSo is it right that the only branch of pop music to be\ngiven an appreciable amount of broadcasting time is that\nwhich the rest of pop music would be gladly rid of?\nLong live John Peel and his precious two or three hours\nbroadcasting time; it may not be the easiest to listen to,\nbut at least it sets you thinking.\ntl ill lA JEROME HELLMAN JOHN SCHLESINGER PRODUCTION\nDUST II M HOFFMAN JON VOIGHT\" MIDNIGHT COWBOY x\" BRENDA VAC CARO \u2022 JOHN Mc GIVER \u2022 RUTH WHITE SYLVIA MILES \u2022 BARNARD HUGHES Screenplay by WALDO SALT \u2022 Based on a novel by JAMES LEO HERLIHY\nProduced by JEROME HELLMAN \u2022 Directed by JOHN SCHLESINGER\nMusical Supervision by JOHN BARRY \u2022 \"EVERYBODY'S TALKIN'\" sung by NILSSON\nORIGINAL MOTION PICTURE SCORE AVAILABLE ON UNITED ARTISTS RECORDS\nCOLOUR by DeLuxe United Artists\nNOW SHOWING LONDON PAVILION\nPICCADILLY CIRCUS PHONE4372982( Fully Licensed Bar)| Progs : Daily 1.10, 3.00, 5.30, 8.10.

    "content": "9th October, 1969 FELIX Page 5\nCOLCUTT\nIt's nice to be back in dear old London, or is it ? J. Elroy Flecker may have been thinking of students looking\nfor lodgings when he said:\u2014\n\"Half to forget the wandering and the pain,\nHalf to remember the days that have gone by,\nAnd dream and dream that I am home again.\"\nThat I should imagine sums up many London student's attitude to being in the news once more.\nThe accommodation problem grows steadily worse\nyear by year, and this year has been no exception. As the\nnumber of students continually grows the accommodation\navailable remains almost static.\nIn fact this year for many reasons it has probably de-creased. The traditional digs that are provided and officially\napproved by U.L. Lodgings Bureau has been cut back\ndrastically by the action of U.L. Presidents Council last\nyear.\nA reasonable statement of intent to prohibit racial is m in student accommodation has been turned into a catastrophe by inept handling. An all too common wrangle between student politicians and college administrators has\nagain resulted in hardship for the college student, particularly those new to the game of catch-as-oat ch can between landlord and tenant.\nTo imagine that the landlords are feeling the cold winds\nfrom Siberia by losing student tenants is to be more than\nnaive but to submit to their blackmail is probably worse.\nWhat was needed from the U.L. administration was careful\nhandling rather than hostile interpretation of Council's wishes. However not all the blame rests with the U.L. ad-ministration, much of it must be carried by Council itself,\nsince it must have realised it was not bargaining from a position of strength. Still, I expect that all the students\nliving out of suitcases at the moment are doing so with\ngreat gladness knowing that such fine principles are being\nupheld.\nAs far as can be seen, this, and many other factors that\nare making accommodation difficult, if not impossible, to\nobtain points in one direction only, to a tight control of\nlandlords letting furnished premises. This has been chewed\nover more times than a Mooney steak, all that remains is\nto see what our local M.P.s can be forced to do about it\nin the next election.\nComing back to College we have the new Student\nHouse and a new lodgings bureau: they both appear to be\nshaping up well, although the latter shows evidence of the\nlandlords' inevitable grip. Perhaps the two further Houses,\naccommodating a total of 120 students will be able to\nalleviate a few more problems; although one presumes that\nopening two months earlier they would have been far more\nuseful. Why, oh why, when a decision is made to finance\nthese Houses it should take more than twelve months to\ncomplete them is impossible to imagine. The conversion, is\nminimal, yet the contractors are in for months and it's the\nsame all along the line.\nWe must put our priorities right: a student can't study\nunless he has a place to live, this of all things must come\nfirst.\nWhat is\nColcutt?\nColcutt was a person, not\na thing, and was responsible\nfor the erection of Colcutt's Tower, otherwise known by\nits more correct name of\nthe Queen's Tower (the\nQueen in question being\nVictoria). This tower was\npart of the Imperial Institute, now mostly demolished to make way for\nCollege Block. Only the\ntower was preserved, and\nwas cleaned up and greatly\nstrengthened at a cost of\nover \u00a3200,000. It is rather\ndifficult to miss standing\nalone before College Block.\n\"Colcutt\" is the pseudonym under which a prominent Union personality\nwrites a comment column\nin FELIX. The identity of\nthe author of this piece is\nnormally known only to the\nEditor. The writer is imagined as sitting on the top\nof Colcutt's Tower surveying\nthe IC scene, and passing\ncomments thereupon.\nConfusing the Issue\nOne of the most confusing\nthings that fresher s come up\nagainst at this College is\nthe incredible number of\nabbreviations and initials\nused by the students already\nhere. In an attempt to\nalleviate the confusion for\nnew students and also for\nany ill-informed second\nyear students, here is a quick run-down on just what\nthose initials do mean.\nICU: Imperial College\nUnion.\nRCSU: Royal College of\nScience Union.\nC& GU: City and Guilds\nUnion.\nRSMU: Royal School of\nMines Union.\nICWA: Imp Coll.

    "content": "Page 4 FELIX 9th October, 1969\nFELIX Graft in Hall Selection?\nAn editorial on the Halls of Residence, and the selection\nof people for places might seem rather premature at this\nearly stage of the session, especially in view of the fact that\nthose who obtained places for this session have only just\nmoved in. There are, however, many disturbing reports from\npeople known to FELIX about the methods of selection last\nyear in particular Halls. Coupled with this there are other\nreasons important enough to call for a working party to be\nset up to investigate Hail selection and to gather a concensus\nof student opinion on the subject of those sections in the Hall\nof Residence dealing with who is allowed into Hall and for\nhow long.\nFirstly, two mistakes known to FELIX which confirm\nthat tar from being lair and democratic, the selection system\nfavours those who are on friendly terms with the committee.\nIn the first case two of a selection committee of three actively\ndisliked a particular reap ph cant and despite the fact that\non paper alone he was worthy of a place (even according\nto t ne two selectors who marked him down) he was not\ngiven one solely because of the antagonistic attitude of these\ntwo selectors. Although this is a case of only one individual\nit surely suggests the possibility that personalities have a greater influence in election (or non-selection) than is desirable if the system is to be fair to every applicant.\nMy second report involves a number of people and is much\nmore disquieting. In the Hall in question the committee had\nselected all the applicants who obviously deserved a place\nin Hall, but were left with a number of rooms to fill. One\nwould have thought that if the credentials of all the remaining applicants were so identical (which in itself is hard to\nbelieve) a method fairer than that employed could have\ndevised. What happened was that the selection committee\npicked out all those applicants known personally to them-selves!\nThere are also more general aspects which suggest that the\nselection system is not what it should be. According to many\npeople wardens places are being abused if they are given to\na person to allow him a third year in Hall for reasons other\nthan medical. But wardens tend to reward work in Hall with\nanother years residence, irrespective of the number of years\npreviously spent in Hall. The point that needs stating here is\nthat any person who spends three years in Hall is effectively\nremoving the possibility of two other people spending a year\nin Hall. And if the chairman of the previous years Hall\ncommittee is to be given a third year in Hall then this too\nshould surely be included in the list of Union officials who\nare allowed an automatic place.\nThe Halls of Residence Handbook, besides listing those\nare given the option of an automatic place, also divides\napplicants into sections \u2014 undergraduate, postgraduate and\noverseas student. The chance of an applicant gaining a place in Hall depends on which category he falls into. The\nonly time a percentage of the total places allocated to\napplicants has been questioned was last session, when the\ncollege authorities sought to double the number of fresher s in Hall. This move caught the Student Residence Officer with\nno real idea as to what the student body thought about the\nsubject; and it was only the combined opinion of the wardens\nwho stopped the move going through.\nNeither during or since this episode has any attempt been\nmade by a Student Residence Officer to obtain the opinion\nof the student body on how many fresher s are desirable in\nHall. If the authorities were to put forward the same demand\nagain, this time armed with dozens of letters from headmasters stating that a place in Hall influences choice of uni-vers it y, the Union would be in no position to either support\nor oppose it, for it has no real knowledge of student opinion\non the subject.\nThe only way to investigate any charges of unfairness in\nthe selection of residents for Hall, and to determine the percentages of places allocated to the specified groups which are\nacceptable to the student body is for the Union to set up a working party into Hall selection procedure, and the allocation of places)\u2014in Hall. Only then could a person refused a place in Hall be sure that it was on merit that his application\nwas judged, and not by the people he knew, or the personality he projected.\n* FELIX, tJ THE NEWSPAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE UNION$\n* Phone 01-589-2963.

J Piers' Piece\nToday marks the first Union meeting of the year, in Mech.\nEng. 220 at 1 p.m. Union policy is made at Union meetings,\nso since a lot of policies must be decided this year, it is\nimportant that you come to the Union meetings.\nThe main matters to be discussed at the first U GM( short for Union General Meeting) are: the lodgings situ a tion, double discipline, IC's five year plan, and representation\non the higher college committees. Here follow a few words\non each.\nLodgings\nBy now you know quite a bit about the development of\nICU's lodgings bureau. It was set up with the generous\nhelp of the College in response to the lodgings crisis which\narose from moves to combat the racially discriminatory\nattitude of the University of London lodgings bureau. Some\nstudents may feel, especially after receiving an un diplomatic letter from Mrs. Tabart, the UL lodgings officer, that it\nwould be better to ignore racism and make the obtaining\nof accommodation easier.\nI do not agree with this. Racism must be fought and\ndefeated; it will not be defeated without hardship. We cannot\nignore the situation and wish it away \u2014 it will not go away\nby itself; if ignored by us and left to the manipulations\nof certain men and certain newspapers racism will increase;\nthe time to fight is now. The University of London is certainly not the place for racism \u2014 hence our efforts and\nhardships.\nOne thing we have learned from the recent developments\nis that the operators of the UL lodgings bureau do not\nseem to have the right attitudes, and backlash might develop.\nThe only solution to the present situation seems to be to\ndo an increasing amount of lodgings work ourselves. It might\nbe possible to employ a lodgings officer for IC and the\nrest of USK in a similar way to Chelsea College; this will\nbe discussed at the UGM.\nRepresentation\nIn response to the Rector's letter, copies of which you may\nhave seen around, it will be proposed that ICU asks again for\nm and a table representation on the Board of Studies, GoB, and\nF&E, this representation being consistent with the idea that\nthe College should be an academic participating community.\nIt will be suggested that there be 5 representatives on the\nBoSt (eg the President, the IC Academic officer and the three\nconstituent college academic officers). As part of this motion\nthe idea of the Imperial College Representative Council will\nbe officially put forward. You can read about this in the\nhandbook or in last year's election propaganda, copies of\nwhich can be obtained from the Union Office.\nDouble Discipline\nA proper probing and consideration of principles always\nseems to reveal that arguments against the Union's policy\nof no double discipline, although superficially appearing\nvalid to some people, have no justification whatsoever.\nEducation is a right; not a privilege, hence it follows that\nthere is no reason why students who are exercising their\nrights to education should have any non-academic disciplinary powers imposed upon them which overlap and add\nto the law of the land; students are people! The Rector\nhas agreed to come to the first U GM at the request of the\nUnion, to explain his opposition to the Union's policy.\nFive Year Plan\nIn response to the Rector's request for student views on\nthe development of IC in the next quin que n niu m( these views\nto be presented to the UGC by February 1970 with outlines\nby this December), IC Council has set up a working party.\nAt today's UGM the suggested areas for discussion must be\nagreed, and further students elected to this working party.\nOne of the most important aspects of the working party\nis that concern e with education \u2014 considering how IC's educational structure must be changed to meet the many\ncriticisms levelled against it, for example its super special is a tion, non-participation, non-critical un creativeness, etc. This\ngroup should have some suggestions before the Board of\nStudies meeting on October 29.\nThe quin que n ni al plan is very important, so if you have\nany ideas bring them along to any meeting of the working\nparty.\nWe hope you like\nthe new\nIMPERIAL COLLEGE BOOKSHOP..... we do !\nOther Matters\nSome of the other import at issues to come up soon are:\nA sabbatical year for me! What a good idea! Investigations\nof many other Colleges on the usefulness of this will soon be\ncompleted.\nThere will soon be discussion on whether or not students\n\u2014or rather, how the students\u2014can have a say over the choice\nof special members of staff who do work of very direct\nrelevance to the student body.\nHalls and Student House rules reform is something else\nwhich needs overall thinking about.\nHow the Union runs\nThe Union, as a democratic body, allows and encourages\nall members to question and give any ideas to any Council\nmember or Union official, and to attend (as observers) any\nmeeting of ICU Council or any of the numerous sub-com-mitte es and working parties. The dates for meetings will\nappear on the Council notice boards in the Union, Southside,\nand College Block.\nIn the Union Office there is always waiting for your\ninspection at ray ful of matters soon to be dealt with, and a \"meetings with the Rector\" record book.

It was only\nafter an expensive trunk\ntelephone call that I found\nthat I had not been allocated\na place. At the time of writ-ing, well into the first week\nof term, I have still not\nheard officially whether I have a place or not.\nI do not wish to complain\nabout not getting a place.\nWhat I will complain about\n(Or: Central Site For\nSore Eyes)\nCongratulations to the\npowers that B. on the\nefficiency of the new College\nBlock. For the benefit of\nthose who have not yet ventured in, perhaps a short\ntour would help clarify the\nsituation slightly.\nYou arrive in the main\nfoyer with the intention of\nobtaining a meal in the\nlower refectory. You stride\ninto the ante-room and\nbump into the queue. This\nseems rather long and very\nstatic, so you decide to try\nthe upstairs snack bar, or\n\"buttery\" if you're that way\ninclined. You climb the outside stairs and walk along\nthe covered promenade.\n\"Ah\", you think, \"I 've\nfound the bookshop at last.\nPerhaps they've got that\nbook I was recommended\nthis morning.\" No such luck,\nso you decide to leave and\nwalk towards the door. Oh!\nThere doesn't seem to be a handle on the inside of the\ndoor, so you have to wait\nin the queue to pass the cash\ndesk.\nHaving escaped you try\nto find the snack bar. Again,\nno luck; there doesn't seem\nto be such a place. However\nyou realise that the way in\nmay be through the wide\nopen spaces of the students'\ncommon room. Propelled by\nthe elastic properties of\nsome of the temporary\nwooden paving stones, you\ntry to find the door to the\nis the inefficiency in dealing\nwith a matter that is of\ngreat concern to many stu-dents. It is the difference\nbetween bringing half a ton\nof luggage relatively easily\nin one's car, or travelling by\ntrain; it is the difference between coming to a car parking space in College, or arriving here and finding that\nyou have to park two miles\naway in Fulham.\nJust as a point of in-te rest, just how are the car\nparking places allocated ?\nHow many people have any\nidea of what goes on ?

And what of the students\nfrom this country? Lodgings\nwere at the best of times\nnever easy to come by. Now,\nwith only fresher s receiving\nhelp from the lodgings\nbureau, as 90 per cent of the\nlandladies in the West London area have been struck\noff the list, the situation is\nchaotic.

Wake up, publicity\nofficers!\nDear Sir,\nMost of us are aware that\n90 per cent of the addresses\nof the Lodgings Bureau in\nthe West London area have\nbeen struck off due to the\nreluctance of Landlords to\ntake overseas students. This\nattitude of the landlords has\nbeen \" righteously \" condemned by London University, but nobody seems to\nconsider that there are\nreasons why British Universities should not accept overseas students in the first\njpl&ce. (Let us define here\nthat an overseas student is\none who does not hold and\nis not entitled to hold aUK passport, i.e. an alien. This\nis a non-racial definition, as\none does not have to be a white anglo-saxon to have a UK passport.)\nThe main reason why we\nshould not accept overseas\nstudents is that there are not\nenough places in our Universities. The minimum entrance requirement for most\nUniversities is 2 A level\npasses and as yet our Universities cannot offer places to\nall the Britons who have\nthese qualifications. If anyone doubts this contact\nUCCA clearing scheme!\nOther countries, notably West\nGermany, are obliged to give\nanyone who has passed the\nnational school - leaving\nexams a place. In Britain we\ncan do nothing like this, so\nit would appear unfair on the\nBritish taxpayer to keep\nBritish students out of places\noccupied by an overseas\nstudent.\nIt has been pointed out\nthat many of our best\nstudents are from overseas;\nare they, however, better\nthan our best? Furthermore,\nwill these excellent students\ncontribute anything to\nBritain? What overseas\nstudents pay in extra fees is\nnothing compared to the loss\nto Britain of a trained tech-no logi st. When we have enough\nplaces to train our own\npeople, then we can offer\nplaces to overseas students.\nUntil then it is intellectual\ngenocide to refuse places to\neligible Britons because their\nplace is occupied by someone\nwho will return to his own\ncountry when his education is\nfinished.\nYours faithfully,\n\"GEORGE X\".

Heralded\non its formation in the early\nsummer as the first\nAmerican - termed supergroup Blind Faith played\njust one free concert in\nHyde Park and then set off\nto gain appreciation (and\nmoney) in the States. Money\nthey have gained in plenty,\nbut it seems that the\npressures of living up to the\nsuper-group image have\nproved too great, and have\nresulted in the break-up of\nthe group.\nThose who are not fortunate enough to have attended the Hyde Park concert\nare therefore left with this\none L.P. as the sole reminder\nthat the group ever existed.\nJudging by the position of\nthe record in the L.P. charts\nit seems that there will be\nmany besides myself who\nqualify to write a personal\nobituary, and predict what\nmight have been.\nThe L.P. consists of just\nsix tracks, which for a studio recording is rather a small number. It is however\nquality which the reviewer\nseeks to comment on, and in\nany case the playing time\ndoes exceed 40 minutes so\nthe group cannot be accused\nof not covering all the available plastic.\nThe reason for the scarcity\nof tracks is that on side two\nDo What You Like almost\nfills the side. This is the best\ntrack of the L.P. and if, as\nseems to be the tendency,\nthe group is considered as a revamped Cream Do What\nYou Like is the best number\nthey have ever produced.\nBearing in mind some of the\nlegacies from the CreamSpoonful, Toad and I'm So\nGlad \u2014 this statement needs\nstrong justification.\nThe basis for the track,\nwritten by Ginger Baker is\na pulsating guitar rhythm by\nEric Clapton: add to this\nWinwood singing at his best\nand you have the first two\nminutes. At this point the\nsequence is broken by Winwood, who takes an organ\nsolo, followed in turn by\nClapton, Grech and Baker\nwho each express their ideas\nin lengthy instrumental solos,\nwith the occasional accompanying chant of Do What\nYou Like in the background.\nIn comparing the two guitar\nsolos with the many instrumental produced by the\nCream it is important to\nremember that neither Bruce\nnor Clapton ever did a solo\nand in all their instrumental\npieces one could always rely\non the other to provide a new idea. On Blind Faith,\nhowever, Clapton and Grech\nboth have to rely on their\nown capacity for improv is a tion, which is a far harder\ntask. Nevertheless they both\ndo exceedingly well, Grech\nmore so than Clapton.\nWinwood was responsible\nfor composing three of the\ntracks on the L.P.: Sea of\nJoy, Had to Cry Today and\nCan't Find My Way Home\nand although all are good\nby normal standards none\ncompare with Baker's com-position.\nOf the other two tracks\nBlind Faith's version of an\nold Buddy Holly number\nWell All Right must cause\nhim to turn in his grave.\nThis is, however, the second\nbest track on the record,\nmainly because of the exciting arrangement. Completing\nthe L.P. is a number by\nEric Clapton singing praises\nto the Lord (sic).\nThen Play On\nFleetwood Mac, Reprise.\nIn the last issue we reviewed the Fleetwood Mac's L.P. \"Pious Bird of Good\nOmen\", released by Blue\nHorizon. Now working for\nReprise they have brought\nout a new album and a single, with material written\nmainly by Danny Kirwen. In\ncontrast to the last L.P., the\nmaterial here is all new, and\nmuch better than their previous efforts. The single\n\"Oh Well\" is almost completely instrumental, as are\nmany of the tracks on the\nL.P., but the tempo changes\nabruptly at various places\nthroughout the record, sometimes switching from a quiet\nAlbatross-like sound to a heavy stomping rhythm,\nwell worth listening to.\nClouds\nJoni Mitchell, Reprise.\nJoni Mitchell's second L.P. takes over where the first\nleft off; some of the tracks\nare well known already,\nespecially \"Both Sides Now\"\nwith which Judy Collins had\na great deal of success.\nThere are ten songs, all composed by Joni Mitchell,\nsome, like Tin Angel, Chelsea Morning, and I Dont\nKnow Where I Stand have\nbeen produced on previous\nL.P.s by other folk singers,\nbut others are new to me.\nThis is not a record that\nyou enjoy the first time you\nhear it, indeed very few\ntracks have recognisable\nmelodies, but after you have\ncome accustomed to the\nmusic, and have heard the\nrecord through once or\ntwice, Joni Mitchell's fine\nsinging and guitar playing\nseems very compelling. It is\na record to listen to rather\nthan have playing in the\nbackground.\nFILMS BOOKS\nA night out in London to\nvisit the cinema poses its\nown special problems. At the\nweekends the whole of the\nWest End is inaccessible\nfrom six p.m. onwards with\nqueues blocking the streets,\nand it means waiting for at\nleast an hour to get in. Often\nthe cheap seats sell out\nearly, even more often cheap\nseats don't exist. So if you\nare prepared to spend vast\namounts of money with the\npossibility of standing in the\nrain all the early evening,\nchoose something worth\nseeing, like Goodbye, Columbus.\nThis is one of the new\nstyle American films featuring actors and actresses who\ncan act and an excellent\nscript. It was a surprise to\nsee the main character played\nby Richard Benjamin,\u2014I did not recognise the name\nbut the face was familiar.\nHe is currently on TV playing the husband in one of\nthe cosy-American-family-life situation comedies the\nBBC spends its money on.\nNeil, the character he plays\nin the film bears a great resemblance to the husband in\nthe TV series, which is\nstrange because no one\ncould describe Goodbye\nColumbus as a cosy film,\nand it would be ludicrous\nto say his family life conformed to the American\nDream in the way all\nAmerican TV situation\ncomedies do.\nNeil is a shiftless young\nman living with his Aunt\nand Uncle and working as a clerk in the town public\nlibrary. In the opening\nfilm sequence he meets\nBrenda, a rich Jewish girl\non vacation from college.\nShe agrees to go out with\nhim, and in the traditional\nAmerican way, romance\nblooms in the following few\ndays and they see each other\nregularly. The girl's family\ndisapprove of him for his\nlack of drive and ambition,\nand Brenda herself tries to\nencourage him to start in the\nrat-race before it is too\nlate.\nFreedom\nAgainst her mother's wishes Brenda invites Neil to\nspend his fortnight's holiday\nwith her family, and after a stormy beginning they settle\ndown to two weeks bliss to-get her. Every night he tiptoes along to her room to\nsleep with her there, every\nmorning he dashes back to\nhis own before her father\nrises. Finally, one night as\nthey are having a shower\ntogether she mentions that\nshe is not using a contraceptive. From then on the\nromance deteriorates as\nNeil sees his freedom dis-appearing.\nAlthough the ending is far\nfrom happy the film itself\nis packed with humorous\nasides, with both Richard\nBenjamin and Ali McGraw,\nwho plays Brenda, showing\ngreat comic talent. One of\nthe more spectacular points\nin the film is the wedding\nscene: Brenda's brother is a muscle - bound baseball\nplayer, described by his\nfather as \"not the brightest\nboy in his class\". Nevertheless he is given a partnership in the firm, married,\nwith a safe future. Neil is\ninvited to the wedding which\nis followed by a great feast\nand dance, where all\nBrenda's rich relations gorge\nthemselves and gradually\ndrink themselves into a stu-por. During the festivities,\nBrenda's father takes her to\none side and tells her how\nhappy he is that he has such\na reliable daughter, and how\nsorry he is for all the parents\nwho cannot trust their\nchildren. Already Neil and\nshe are growing apart from\neach other, her departure to\nUniversity and his return to\nwork only deepens the rift\nbetween them.\nThe basic theme of the\nfilm is the conflict between\nthe girl's natural love for\nher parents and close-knit\nfamily life and her attraction\nto Neil, the freeman. She\nhas been brought up to\nbelieve money and advancement are everything, and discovers that Neil's freedom\nsets him apart from her\nworld and way of life, while\nNeil sees his life more and\nmore in the light of growing\ninsecurity.\nAlso worth seeing in London is Targets, a supporting\nfilm, again from America,\nagain about the American\nway of life, or death, to be\nmore accurate. Some parts of\nthe plot are clich ed but the\ninsight the film provides into\nthe American preoccupation\nwith guns and their right to\ncarry them makes it well\nworth the money. The plot\nconcerns a young psychopath\nwho, after murdering his\nwife and mother, sets off\nwith a bag filled with guns\nand ammunition, determined\nto kill as many as possible\nbefore being caught. His last\nact is to climb up behind\nthe film screen at a drive-in\nmovie, poke a hole in the\ncanvas and try and pick off\nas many of the audience as\npossible with a rifle.\nIt's good for a laugh if\nnothing else.\nAn Age, by Brian Aldiss,\nis a novel about time and\npeople. Publishers are\nSphere Books, price 5/-.\nLoosely termed as science-fiction, this book concerns\none Edward Bush, an artist\nwhose psychological hang-ups are quickly revealed to\nthe reader. Part of the novel\nis set in the future about a century hence, in a Britain\non the edge of bankruptcy.\nSomeone has discovered a drug which gives anyone who\nuses it the ability to \"mind\ntravel\" into the far past, the\nDevonian, Cambrian and\nJurassic eras. The book is\nsprinkled with scientific\ndetails concerning the conditions connected with such\ntravelling, but these are aside\nfrom the main theme, which\nis the nature of time itself.\nThe mind travellers exist as\nghosts in the desolate wastes\nof the earth before man\never existed; most of them\nare rich social drop-outs;\nbut others are working for\nthe Institute, an organisation\nfirst set up for scientific research but later dedicated to\nmore sinister purposes. There\nare a lot of faults in the\nplot, which are admittedly\ndifficult to avoid given such\na complicated setting in\ntime and space, but the\nquality of Mr. Aldiss'\nwriting is evident in the\nbeautifully descriptive\npassages set in the half-world\nof the past, and, in sharp\ncontrast, his vision of a totalitarian British Isles\nwhere freedom has disappeared and martial law\nprevails.\nHis prose often reads like\npoetry, and it is easy to\nbecome confused with the\ncourse of the action, but An\nAge is worth persevering\nwith for the questions posed\nby its ending. It's also a very\nenjoyable way of spending\nan evening instead of watching the box.\nIn a totally different vein,\nSignet and Mentor books\nare soon to be turning out\nthree of Isaac Asimov's science books called Understanding Physics. These are\nwritten for the layman and\nDr. Asimov has laid all the\nemphasis on making his\nstyle as clear as possible.\nNot for the enthusiastic\nPhysics or Engineering\nstudent, but they make very\nuseful gifts for the unscientific friend, or for Maths\nstudents like me who could\nnever understand the subject.\nThey cost 8/6 each and are\npublished this Autumn.\n\n"

The number and standard\nof the bars at I.C. is well\nknown and envied throughout the London colleges.\nThere are two main bars and\n5 others open to students, as\nwell as the many temporary\nbars set up at parties, etc,\nwhile the staff have their\nown drinking places in the\nSCRs. All of these are free\nhouses, and the major ones\ncan boast of a range of\ndrinks that will beat most\npubs and other colleges; at\nleast 5 different keg bitters\nare available.\nBy far the most popular\nplace to drink in the College\nis the Southside bar. The\nsenior barman here is Mr.\nStan Kearns, who has run\nthis bar for 4 years now. He\nis justifiably proud of the\nchanges that have taken\nplace during this period.\nIn 1965, the bar sold only\ntwo draught beers, one brand\neach of whisky and gin, had\nfew bottled beers on its one\ncold shelf, and had no keg\ncider, wines, or sherry. Four\nyears later there are 9 beer\npumps, and one has only\nto look along the packed\nshelves behind the bar to see\nthe fantastic range of bottled\nbeers, wines, spirits, and\nliqueurs. Teetotallers need\nhave no fears, as Stan stocks\na full selection of nonalcoholic drinks. Indeed,\nalthough the ICU President\nis frequently seen in the bar,\nthe strongest thing he ever\ndrinks is orange crush!\nHowever, the popularity\nof Southside bar has\nbrought problems. The first,\ngross overcrowding, is ob-Drinkers photographed recently in the Union Bar. On the\nshelves behind the bar are many tankards, given to the\nstudents by their Unions, clubs and societies.\nFor the latest books on:\nLAMLEY'S History\nA Architecture A Languages\nM for your\u2014\nQrama\n1 BOOKS\nAnthropology\n^'a't ural History E ART MATERIALS\nEconomics\nY PAPER BACKS\nVisit the\nY STATIONERY\nHaldane Library2 nd Floor, Library Block,\nS* Open Mon. to Fri., 10\u20145.30\n1 EXHIBITION ROAD, S.W.7 vio us to the harassed customer trying to force his way\nthrough to the counter after\nabout 9 p.m., and is equally\nobvious to the equally\nharassed and over-worked\nbarmen. Since the bar opened\nover 5 years ago, the turnover has increased more\nthan threefold, but the\nnumber of barmen has only\ngone up by one. On some\noccasions the situation is so\nbad that the bar can only\nfunction by using temporary\nstudent barmen. Even so,\nthe staff are often so busy\nserving drinks that they have\nno time to go out and collect\nglasses, and so a shortage\nof glasses occurs. Some of\nthe students who have helped\nout in the bar confirm how\noverworked the bar staff\nare.\nStan attributes the lack of\nbarmen to two principal\ncauses: firstly the pay is poor\ncompared to the majority of\npubs, and secondly there is\nno accommodation for bar\nstaff provided by the\nCollege. The latter point is\nimportant, as it is difficult to\nget home by public transport by the time the barmen\nhave closed and tidied up the\nbar. Stan claims that 6\nmonths have passed since\nthe Refectory Committee\nagreed that the barmen\nshould have a rise and that\nattempts would be made to\nprovide them with flats near\nthe College. However, so far\nthis lumbering body has\nfailed to implement either\ndecision, and the best reply\nStan has been able to get is\n\"we've got that in mind too\".\nStan hopes for results now\nthat Dr. Ken Weale has\nbecome chairman of the new\nBar Committee.\nAnother urgent problem\nin Southside as far as the\nbar staff are concerned is\nthe acute shortage of storage\nspace. The small beer cellar\ncan only hold 3 to 4 days\nsupply of keg and tank beer,\nwhile crates of bottled beers\nhave to be stacked up at the\nends of the bar. A further\ngrowing nuisance in Southside is rowdiness. Despite the1 price differential between the\nUnion and Southside bars,\nmany drinkers think that\n2d per pint is a not unreasonable price to pay for the\nvastly improved comfort of\nthe latter bar. On some nights\nit is not wise to take in a timid girlfriend, a fact which\nmany users of the only bar\nsuitable for entertaining girls\nfind rather annoying. Discipline in the bars is the\nresponsibility of the student\nduty officers, and Stan hopes\nthat they will keep the\nrowdiness down in the\nfuture.\nOne possible way to avoid\ncustomers overcrowding the\nbar is to open up the hardly-used SCR buttery to\nstudents, and employ more\nbarmen to staff this. However, this is unlikely to\nLinstead bar, which opened last January, is the ideal\nplace for a quiet drink, and the Hall is well known for its\nparties and Disco-bars.\noccur as certain staff members jealously guard their\nright to have their own bar\non the few nights a month\nthey want to use it.\nPassing on from the crush\nof Southside, one can call\nin either Linstead or Weeks\nHall (or both). Here the bars\nare student run, so the\nstandard of service is on\noccasion a little unprofessional. These are definitely\nthe bars for a quiet evening\ndrink, though the service\ntends to suffer when the unpaid student barmen decide\nto drink away the evening's profits!\nWalking along to the Beit\nbuilding, one may enter the\nUnion bar after first leaving\none's girl-friend outside this\nall-male preserve. This bar\ntends to be either half empty\n(midweek) or packed out\n(weekends and special functions), and the standard of\nbehaviour is way below that\nof the other bars. The\namount of custom on normal\ndays has dropped off sharply\nover the past year, and with\nthe redecorating and refurbishing of the bar and the\ncrushes in Southside, it remains to be seen whether\nthe usage of the bar will return to a more reasonable\nlevel. The stock of beers\nhere is extensive, but there\nare few wines or liqueurs.\nLadies can get service, with\na bit of luck, at the extension bar in the corner of the\nUnion lower lounge.\nThe Crush bar, outside the\nconcert hall in the Union\nbuilding, opens on dance\nnights to serve a limited\nrange of beers.\nFinally, lunchtime drinks\nwill be available at the new\nCollege Block bars. The\nstudents' bars will not open\nat night except for special\nfunctions. Fears have been\nexpressed that this bar will\nprove to be totally inadequate to cope with such\nfunctions. There is very\nlimited space to store beer\nwith no cold store for keg\nbeer, though the breweries\nwill provide flash coolers\nfor the keg in use.\nThe Senior Common\nRoom bar is even more in-adequate, and, is notable for\nits two-glass size washing up\nsink! At the time of writing,\nthe bar shutters cannot be\nlocked. It is apparent that\nsome of the design mistakes\nmade in Southside have been\nrepeated here.\nThat concludes the\nFELIX tour of the bars in\nIC.

For example, if\nthere is a shortage of glasses\ndon't just go and get one\nfor yourself, take back as\nmany as you can. If you intend to get drunk, don't go\nto one of the lounge bars.\nIn these, and other ways, you\ncan help to improve the\nfacilities both for yourself\nand for the other users.\nPleasant drinking!\nThe Southside Senior Barman, Stan Kearns, relaxes for\na moment in one of the infrequent quiet spells in this1 bar.\nANDREWS\nphotographic\nFelix wishes to thank Mr.\nKearns for his help in compiling this article.
