Born and bred in Sutton,\na Suffolk village where for the past eighteen years\nhis father has kept the local hostelry -'The Plough1\nThe second decade of his life began at Lelston\ngrammar Sohool where he spent eight years in a carefree co-educational atmosphere. -Headers, can\nyou not see the environmental effect on e hara c ter building up even at that age!.\n1952 found him at Guilds pursuing his chosen\ncareer of Civil Engineering. However it was through\nthe Rifle Club that he first became known. Living in the country he has and makes use of shooting rabbits\netc; surprisingly enough he HAS a licence. It seems\nthat on one occasion during the war, whilst pr act i sing pistol shooting with a U.S. army revolver, he\nnearly shot the cat,descendants of which must still be feeling the blast. His steady eye- no comment -has earned him iris I.C. full colours for shooting.\nHowever this year his happy smile, or should\nI say lecherous leer, graces Council in the capacity\nof Entertainments Chairman and it is in this post\nthat most of you will recognise the above portrait. He has wandered around the world on Vac. jobs\nover the past four years to places as far apart as\nStockholm and the London Docks. In the former his steady eye was 'put out' for a while after he colli ded with alam post through looking at a passing\ngirl. She certainly gave him the eye - a black one!\nIn I.C. Hostel he is well known for his loud\n'good-nights' and his referring to intruders as\nmiserable pieces of turf.Mention must be made of\nthe lampshades in his room. Their colour is not\nblue for a boy or red for but a subtly Ivannic\nshade of pink!\nHis hobbies are women and collecting earrings -an excellent combination.\nHe likes Swedish coffee, his pipe and throwing\n- trifle. He dislikes loudly ticking clocks,early rising ahd being on t ne receiving end of an airborne trifle. Finally, as a tip to would be party p ivers here\nis u is recipe for a good o up of coffee:\nas hot as hell, as black as night and as sweet\nas love.\nTHOUGHTS FOR THE WEEKEND.\n1 tie \u2022\"bod s\" who sleep in lectures\nhey'd be much more\n\"bod s\" who\npla.of^ end to end --j rta hie.\nthen, a boy breaks a date, he has to -when a e irl breaks a date, she has two!\nA. ns.x student, who left I.C. not more than\n' y** rc ago, now possesses a Rolls-Royce\na gen+ley. -- It can hso sen!

This Hop was a great\nsuccess from all points of view and reminded one of the better Hops of\nthe good old Gym and Upper Dining Hall days of\nlast year. There was a complete sell out of raffle tickets for a bottle of \" grand old Scotch liqueur\nwhisky\",and 'Hags' conducted the Dutch Auction with\nmuch aplomb. We feel that he has probably missed\nhis vocation i A sobering influence, however, was\nthe Soccer Captain's black tHe and dark suit - for\nthe Cup semi-final we didn't win,but the gay atmosphere soon cheered him up. (Jueenie's Bar was perhaps\nher best effort in that direction to date!\nFor the statistician, approximately \u00a330 was raised\nfor the British S.T.

All was taken in good spirit and perhaps forthcoming exams had something to do with this childishness.\nThe Guild's Carnival, reported elsewhere, appears\nto have raised some controversy regarding the pos-it ion of future carnivals. It seems that Carnivals\nare rapidly becoming as ham blas and if they degenerate further, some one in authority is going to\nput a stop to them. When we visited the Guilds\nCarnival at about 6.40 there seemed to be little superficial signs of hooliganism and a few die-hard\ncouples appeared still to be enjoying themselves in their.various ways I Perhaps there were numerous\nnewspaper reporters' prostrate bodies secreted in some\nspecial room.\nFelix is produced under some duress this week.

Soon after this came the Goldsmiths break-sway which was to produce their goal which was a well taken chance from clever exploitation of the\nweaknesses In the I.C. defence.\nThough exciting to watch, the game began to degenerate and became rather scrappy. A near miss for\nI.C. came however when Bay, diving, headed Just past\nthe post. Until the final whl at leI. C. continued\nto press for an equalise r but the Goldsmiths defence\nwere never rattled.\nGoldsmiths deserved to win. I.C. should have made\nmore use of the long ball out to their wingers and\nthe wing halves might be criticised for playing too\nmuch of an \u2022t tacking game leaving their opposing\ninside forwards very often unmarked.\nI.C.

    "content": "FELIX s.MUG TEST. general Description\nThe glass was in the form of a frustrated\nnone. Down one side was a fissure probably\ncaused by imp a ot. It bore the inscription \"Property of G. W.H.. Not to be taken away.\"\nDetermination of Cubic Capacity\nThe number of times the mug had to be refilled to produce as ozz le factor of 10 was noted.\nDetermination of Suokabillty constant\nTo determine the Suckability Constant, the mug\nwas filled, and the contents drunk. The Suokabillty\nConstant was found to be so good that this test was\nrepeated a large number of times, until not only\nwere the contents drunk but the operators as well. It was found to be very diff i ou lt to test a single\nmug when one appears to have 2 mugs and twi oe the\nnormal number of laboratory staff. Determination of Rate of flow\nThe rate of flow was measured with a Moving\n3uck et ff all ono meter of a type designed by Messrs.\n3ur p and Pardon of the Ministry of Alchohology.\nThe normal measuring cylinder of this instrument\nhad been replaced by a reverberating Hick Cup of\nour own design.\nThe integral of rate of :Jlow x time for flow in and out were found to be equal proving\ntn us the empirical law that what goes in must\ncome out. (This was found to be applicable to\noperators as well.)\nFIG. I MIN\npints/ Min = f( mina)\nArea under graph represents the volume\nconsumed.\nPO/int p represents\nthe ultimate Sozzle\n'Factor. This varies\nfrom person to person\nbeing nearly equal to\ninfinity for Miners.\nComment on Design\nThe first thing about the mug that strikes\none, is the foam. There ought to be some way\nof removing it.( A small fan perhaps with a dancer to propel it). Another improvement we\nsuggest, is the provision of some form of alarm\nto inform the operative that the mug is nearly\nempty so that steps could be taken to refill it before genuine <li stress was caused.\nConclusions\nAs everyone knows, the conclusions are the most\nimportant part of an experiment.\nBALDY\n1*11 teach you to try and find out whether my\npermittivity is greater than my reluctance.\nCOMING EVENTS FBEDAY FEB 4th,I. lOp.m, In zoology lecture theatre.

    "content": "4\nFELIX LETTERS TO THE EDITOR\nI.e. Hostel.\nThe Editor,\nFELIX.\nDear Sir, May I take advantage of the spa oe offered\nby your columns to air a few thoughts on the subject of Carnivals.\nThe great thing about Carnivals Is that\nt ney represent some of the few occasions In the\nyear men everyone Is intent on enjoying themselves\nYou can get to know anyone, do or say almost anything and know that it won't be held against you on\nthe following day.\nas well as giving people a oha no e to try their hand at decorations and humor ou b dramatics,\nt ney enable them to get to know the opposite sex \u2014\nan all we say \u2014 a little better, and to learn their own capacity for alcohol} and why not? We have to\nlearn sometime, and among one's friends at I.C. seems to me the best place that one could wish to\ndo it. personally, though, I am not sure that\nwe are achieving our object at the moment, as there\nis a definite increase in general irresponsibility as distinct from free and e say enjoyment.\nI nave never been completely sober at a Carnival, myself, except on oe when I was recovering\nfrom a party the night before, so this is not\nwritten from any narrow-minded viewpoint.\nIt is quite noticeable that, however,\nthat the cabarets are having more and more difficulty in.making themselves heard, and the breakages\nin the refectory and the bar have increased alarm-ingly. Is flinging trifle across the refectory\nreally fun after it ceases to be original, and did\nthe people who tore down a large quantity of the\ndecorations at the Mines' Carnival during the first hour realise that they were destroying the work of\ntheir fellow students?\nOf course they almost certainly weren't sober, and perhaps that is really the point. Isn't adding one's liquor? as the saying goes, not merely a matter of physically holding it, but of showing\nthat you are a reasonable character when the shell of sobriety is washed away, and if you find that\nyou're not, of doing something about it. This, of course, probably means that I can't hold mine, so perhaps we all ought to think\nabout it. Mike Neale.\nThe Editor, Felix. Dear Sir, Investigations are being made by a group of\nI.C. students into the state of Morality within\nthe college, they asked one of their number to\nwrite a report on the Guilds' Carnival. Happily,\nthis reporter was quickly Imbued with alcoholic\na pir it, rather than the spirit of righteousness,\nso possibly this report will not be written in a form accept i ble to those who wish to decry the\nbehaviour of I.e. It is felt by these students that I.C. is immoral, and that the outward manifestations of\nthis is evident from the conduct of those e.t the\nGuilds' Carnival. sir! Immorality implies\ncoarseness and vulgarity. If we were sJ, then\nthe Jelly Battle in the refectory would have\ndegenerated into a punching brawl. B'.t no. We\nsoon wont across to \" listen\" to the Ct-o are t. The\naudience were kept waiting, so they trap t the show\nwaiting - and how! The Cabaret wen-, on bravely,\nbut it t was a case of who could shou. the loudest.\nOne side having many times the vo ije s, and the\nother, a couple of microphones (rr aero phones?) With all this chaos, including 1j sing of scripts,\ncollapse of curtains, and near ie struct ion of\nmusical instruments, not once jid any one become crude or offensive.\nEveryone had a jolly di> ime at the Carnival\nand it is about time this sia pid confusion between\n\"Immorality\" and \"Good Tlae-' ended.\nYrs. etc, T42\nCHILTERN HUNDRED The navigation rally held last Friday night\nwas a great au oe as, even though it was the first time an all night rally had been organised by the\nC ft d Motor Club. Seventeen drivers signed on\nat the \u2022Peggy Bedford}\" - near London Airport - and set\noff with their crews about 10 p.m. on a100 mile\nsearch for an even greater number of Guildsman\nhidden at obscure points among the chilterns.\nTo find the first point, Competitors had to tramp about in a swamp. The hidden marshals had\nto exe roi a e the greatest restraint on hearing the\nsearchers calling for them in the strongest tones\nfin/i terms, One navigator was heard blowing a whistle franti o ally for a marshal (who of course\ndid not appear to the summons). Even so, one poor\nman, deeply discouraged, wandering vaguely around\nholding his route card in his hand wa s amazed when\nsomeone he was about to pass took his card from him\nand\" time checked it! One would have thought that\nthe title of a point, \"Everest\", would have lead\ntired competitors to expect some relaxation but the\nsight of a row of lights leading to a tent at the\ntop of a hill unaccountably caused him to climb the\nthing rather than search at the foot where the\nmarshal was patiently waiting.\nThe course eventually lead to the halfway\npoint where a short break could be taken. Amusements were provided - the Chief Perpetra or in vi ting all navigators to a round of golf 'At Two\nO 'clock in the Morning'. After envious glances at\nthe Organisers' cooking arrangements - and Cookthe Competitors went \"To the Woods\". The marshals\nand the Moustache so well known in20 were only\nlocated afl era chase over numerous ploughed fields. Then to Che>-,ham to \"Late Night Final\" where the\nlanguage was said to be the worst on the whole rally due to the illusive positions of the Marshals and\nthe frivolous notices they had exhibited. After\na further point, cunningly concealed among Burnham\nBeeches, back to the finish at \"June's Cafe\" where\ncompetitors clocked of fat about 5.30 a.m. and\nstrengthened themselves for the journey home with\ncups of coffee and plates of ? and chips.\nOpinions on the rally, although in particular\ncases unprintable, were generally very favourable.\nThe organisers wish to take this o port unity of\nthanking all the many people who have helped to\nmake this event so enjoyable.\nThe first I.C man (seo on d man home) was\nK.G. Hound \u2014 Wolseley 18. The first motor-cyclist was Bob Walker, R.C.S. Thirteen people out of the seventeen starters\nfinished the course. It was said that the four\nnon-finishers found their female companions too\ndistracting.\nM.T. D.K.K. D. Dear Sir, We .ie heard mu eh of the mission to Catholios\nand Non-Cho l los in recent days. We found it quite nov t. to di so over those little oar ds posted\nin every iL geon hole in the Union racks and surely\nthat st aau1& have brought the Ulaaiom ta the notice\nof p raetia l lyall th e students In the college.\nBut no. Jne further a ot of intrusive publicity\nwas deem'd neo ess ary by the organisers.\nWe /rare not amused to s it down in the Refectory\nand fin staring at us from the middle of the table\nyet mo?e of these oar ds. We feel that some means\nof o or cro l should be exerted over the pub lio it y met ji c is of certain clubs and societies. Publioity\nstupi^d be u on fined to the not ioe boards provided for the purpose and possibly to o an vas singin entrance\nhalls, etc. It should NOT be allowed to intrude on\nr ir daily habits, and particularly not on our meals.\nYours sincerely,\nT. Bailey,\nG. Grimshaw.\n\n"

Not only was a FELIX reporter present at the\nGuilds Carnival on Jan. 21st., the EVENING STANDARD also was there. An item entitled \"Cavemen\"\nappeared In the \"In London last night\" column of\ntheir next day's is suo. Although the write-up was\nvery flattering from some points of view, in other\n\u2022aspects it was Just plain inaccurate. These gossip\ncolumnists Just don't know what goes on.\nThis was the STANDARD'S description of\nCarnival:the\nBones, animal hides, prehistoric birds\nand charcoal braziers decorated an enormous\ncave where druids and cave women danced\nwearing bath towels and leopard skins. Students at the City and Guilds College, Kensington were celebrating the New Year with\na carnival.\nf\\ pterodactyl - a prehistoric flying mammal - was suspended from the ceiling of one\nof the three dance floors.\nDuring the buffet at ml d nl t_*.t there was\na fight with trifle pudding. At eight this\nmorning breakfast was served to the remnants\nof a party of more than a thousand people.\nJudging by the tone of the whole thing the\nStandard was expecting a small Chelsea Arts Ball. With a touch of imagination (stimulated by alcohol\nperhaps?) our snack bar with decorations might be\nlikened to an enormous cave, Oh Where! - did the\n1000 people come from?\nThe sentence about the fight with trifle pudding was unfortunately quite correct, and that is not the kind of publicity for our Carnivals.\nThe decorators set about their task with much\nvigour and originality. Perhaps the Snack Bar\ndid not look quite like a vast cavern as they\nhad hoped, but the effect was good and the\ninnovation of having two bars most popular.\nThe decorations were definitely the high\nspot of the evening but the cabaret, in suite\nof the hard work put in by the performers,\nwas for the most part rendered inaudible by\nthe audience. Only Mr. Basil Svans was able to\nquell the riot whilst he gave arul phe c it ul ph at ion which amused us all even if only half\nunderstood 1\nThe buffet degenerated into at rifle fight\nand the Jazzmen in the Upper Dining Hall, apart\nfrom the indomitable Johnny Parker, tend efl to\nflag after a while.\nBut in general the majority did have the\ngood time they looked for\n- SHOT UP OID MBH } JUST SWOTTIN^\nFOrt THE NCXT CfMJNIVfJL\nREFECTORY COMMITTEE The Refectory Committee met on Monday 24th January. The main part of the meeting dealt with\nproblems of alternative catering arrangements after\nSaster. As yet, nothing definite has been decided\nbut both the Rector and the Planning Dept. regard\nthe matter as being urgent. It is very probable\nthat in addition to Ayrton Hall and the new temporary Refectory in the Union Building, an additional room will be available in the neighbourhood.\nThe Easter closing will be complicated this year\nby the fact that kitchen equipment in the Union\nBuilding has to be transferred from the West end\nof the building to the temporary space on the site of the Old Lounge. This will put the Refectory\nout of action for probably the whole of the vac-ation. Alternative arrangements will be made to\ncope with this situation so that meals will be\nobtainable within the college during the vacation,\nexcept for the normal five days closing over the\nEaster period.\nOther business discussed by the Committee\nwas the announcement that a Nutrition expert,\nMiss Ward, will shortly make a survey of the nut-rit ional value of our menu. In succession to\nthe Rector, Professor Ubbelohde has been appointed Chairman of the Wine Committee.\nThe Ayrton Hall sub-cou i mitte e were able to\nreport that Ayrton Hall was now fully available\nfor evening functions, and that facilities had\nbeen made for Attendants and for Ladies Cloakroom space.\n\n"

Circulations1200 This FELIX i a Being sold on the last day\nof the first half-session, a time w hio h.i a generally quiet for the Union, and within, the\nColleges. Thia i a naturally so because for many\npeople in the Mines and R.C.S. it is examination\ntime. The quietness i a as It should he for we\nshould all take our examinations seriously.\nSinoe we oom e to Imperial College for techno logi o al training seo on d to none in the oo un try, it is right that our work should oom e first. Any student of this College who unnecessarily\nneglects his work for other activities is being\nunfair, both to himself and to those people responsible for sending him here.\nHowever we are members of a University ins-t it uti on here at I.C. and we owe obligations to the student body to which we belong. A Student\nUnion is a self-contained community, and should\nbe a preliminary training ground for life in la rger and more adult communities. Yet how many of\nus use the opportunities thus offered to be oom e participating members of our community, coming to\nterms with it and obtaining a more mature outlook\non life? The answer of course is, too few.\nOut of 2000 students at Imperial College, a very\nconservative estimate would be that 1000 take no\npart in any Union activities. Who are the missing 1000 ? Do they have no social interests or\nhobbies, or a sport to play ? Of course they do,\nbut their free time is spent away from College,\nthe reason being the general difficulty and expense\nof travelling about London. With a College as\nvast as ours, situated in Kensington, residential schemes as. exist at other Universities are impossible; although we feel that something oo ul d, and should be done for those people who would\nlike to live nearer to I.C., if something were\nprovided.\nThe real trouble is too much apathy. Work\ncan be fitted in with Union activities and travelling problems as many Union Officers have shown\nin the past. Even lunch-time activities are\nsupported by no more than 400 people, who we suspect are the same people who join in during the\nevenings and at weekends. As the College expands\nwe hope that more people will make their Univers it y education a complete one, otherwise too much\nwill continue to be done by\" too few for too many.\nATTENTION ALL.\nA large number of tools.pliers.hammers\nand saws.wsr e lost after the last carnival If' anyone has any idea where these may he found\nwould they write to BOX 1,FELIX.\nFor Sale: Match Tennis Balls, good condition, at\nprices from 15/- do z. will sell in lots of four.\nApply Secretary, R.

TICKETS' Zj-or3/6 DOU&kE\nIE\\\nIt has been a short while since \"Viewpoint\"\nappeared last in Felix, but the reo ent Carnival\ndeserves no small oom ment in view of the attendant happenings.\nA Carnival i a the College equivalent of a Chelsea Arts Ball, and oost safi ft fj \u00b0f the amount\nto attend. In this light, the ticket price is very reasonable, and the margin for profit is neglig able. The Guild's Carnival net liabilities total at least \u00a3110.\nTo balance these liabilities, if a working\nfigure of one hundred tickets is used, then\ntie ket sales should have netted \u00a3100. About 70\ntle ket s were sold.\nTo quote the Evening Standard, a party of a thousand people attended - we divide this by four\nto obtain a fair estimate - which gives us 250\npeople present.\nTotal present: 250\nPresent with tickets: 140\nPresent without tickets: 110\nAbout \u00a35 was collected In half crown admission\nto the Cabaret, that is,40 un partnered men paid.\nThis leaves 70 people who paid nothing to attend -2\n8\n?\n\u00a3 of the number there.\n\"This Carnival has run at a bigger loss than\nany previously\" says a member of Guilds Entertainments committee.\nIs it little wonder that the Carnival runs at\na loss, with these unscrupulous people, in the words\nof the Yorkshire proverb, \"Takin' all and pay in' now t\"? One does not need to contemplate long before\nthe realization that Carnivals will cease to exist,\nwith such a state of dishonesty, becomes apparent.\nThese people have come to expect da no ing, buffet\nand cabaret as free, gratis and for nothing.\nThere is one solution: throw the louts out -in the gutter where they belong.\nFelix will cake much pleasure in printing the\nnames of such people after the next carnival.\nP.A.E.S. JUDO SPORTS PAGE CONTINUED..\nL.3.E. On Wednesday, January 19th I,C. entertained\nL.S. ii. to a Judo mato h.L.S. E. is rather a new\nclub, and apart from one 1st Kyu, or brown belt,,\ntheir team consisted of 6th Kyus, or white belts.\n1.0. in return fielded 6th Kyus, with one 5th( yellow) and one 3rd Kyu (green). The I.e. beginners did ,.ell, all winning their bouts, and the\nolder hands were also successful with well yr a otis edo so to gar i's, taio to sn i's, and hara i gosh i1s. L.S.E. also brought along Mr. Nakanishi, a Japanese 4th Dan (Black Belt) now studying at L.S. S. As there are very few men in England of that high\na grade, let alone in I.e., Mr. Nakanishi kindly\nacted as referee. After the match, which resulted\nin a12 to 1 victory on points for I.e., he gave\nvaluable advice to both teams.\nH.M. A. Sandhurst\nThe following Wednesday, Jan. 26th, I.C. went\ndown to Sandhurst. The Cadets team was fighting\nOxford, and I.C. fought a team consisting mostly of\nwonderfully fit P.T. instructors and other regular\nArmy instructors.\nBurford succumbed to an ogo shi by one P.T.I., and seth did well to draw with an even bigger one.\nRotgans had an easier task, and convincingly beat a languages lecturer, but after a battle of hip throws\nWilliams narrowly lost to a Grenadier sergeant.\nScience as opposed to strength is the principle\nof Judo, but as one of our team discovered there is not a lot one o an do scientifically when picked up\nbodily anf hurled to the ground. One of t ne most\ninteresting bouts was between the I.C. captain,\nMacpnerv.on, and his cadet opponent, when oso to gari was matched by kb so to gari. The final result was a win to the H.M. A. by\n5 points to 4s. this being I.C.'s first defeat this\nyear.\n\n"
