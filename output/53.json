    "content": "FELIX\nPROFILE\nJ. M.IA TH AWAY Great confusion rp ign s in the Union Oiiice this year -when Lrs. Robb. shouts \"JohnJ\", both tile President and\nSecretary answer. The only solution to the difficulty has\nbeen to label them John-filly and John. La3t week FJ2LIX\nprofiled John Willy; this week it's John.\nJohn Murray Hathaway spent his school days at Felsted\nschool, where he rose to the position of school prefect and\nhead of his house, at.the same time gaining a lively interest\nin various sports, including rug ger, squash and swimming,\nand (\n.\n'\n) Physics.\nThe nation then requested his services for eighteen\nmonths. lie entered the Royal Artillery, and later, ;_on s officer cadet school, gaining a commission as second\nlieutenant. After four idle months in an amy/ pigeonhole at Vi'oo lw i oh, he was sent off to Gibraltar in charge of\na maintenance battery. A many-sided job was this - it included supervising regimental sports, paying off the\nkeeper of the apes, ( whose presence is the traditional\nguarantee of continued .British posse sion of the Rock),\nclearing the wreckage of an exploded ammunition ship, and\nappearing as witness in a Spaniel-, court. John's National\nservice seen s to have given Mm a love of big guns, which\nnay explain his n resent position as Union Sec. But as yet\nno blast or rockets have issued i'r oj. the Union Office.\n. John flew back from Oib. in August '51 to become a very\ngreen R.C.S. fresher. Runour has it that he even Mistook\nDai Nicholas for the Rector.' At any rate he was one of the\nquiet few at R.C.S. union meetings, and studied hard to\nremove the mental rust of unlettered Amy life. It was\nnot long, however, till the Rugger club discovered him, and\nhe became a member of the I.C.\"A\" team - one of 'the boys'\nwho kept in shape by continual elbow-bending exo er c is e in the bar.\nSecond year found him as year rep., Chairman of K.O.S. \u2022Entertainments Committee, and on the top floor of the old\nHostel, where he distinguished himself by kicking a rug ger ball through the glass doors. Later in the year an old\nrug ger injury recurred to put him in bed during VJhitsun and\nshortly after Coronation. As a result he has had to join\nthe spectators at rug ger games, but is still an enthusiastic\nsupporter of the club. His other sporting activities\ncontinue unabated, especially squash - \"the Hostel game\".\n\\!hen this year he became Seoretary of the Union, he\nv/ as strongly urged to move from his perch atop the Old\nHostel to a more accessible room, but firmly refused, saying\nthat five flights of stairs would lighten his work by\neliminating all but the meat serious visitors. Actually,\nit has not worked out that way - John himself uses the room\nonly between the hours of 12 p.m. and 8 a.m. but he still manages to be extremely elusive.\nLike most science students, his extra-curricular\ninterests are non-scientific. They include the reading of\nclassical literature and poetry, music (hot quite to the\nMozart stage yet\"), and ballet. He is keenly interested in\nother people, and enjoys watching their antics on tube trains\nand city streets. Since the simmer of ^88 John has become\na keen Christian, and is a committee member of the Christian\nUnion. His practical faith finds expression in all his\nactivities and Attitudes. On executive matters he tends\nto have definite opinions which are expressed with clarity\nind a certain restrained forcefulness. He finds Council\nmeetings tiring, be o a use one has to thin!: like mad if one\nis to be of any use to the Union.\"\nSensitive, esa j res siVe, yet controlled, he can be easily\nhurt by a friend vino lets him down. Indeed this is\npossibly his greatest fault - if fault it is that he\nexpects the same high standard of dependability from hio\nfriends as he does of himself. But it is rather difficult\nto find fault with him, and his acquaintances sum him up as\nan all-rounder, well-worth knowing.\nA. Grand Eviction Party was held by ix. J. Douglas and\nMr. 3. George at their Sydney Street residence on the\nnight of V/ed nes day21 st Oct. Guests provided their own\nentertainment in the form of beer and wine. Other\nentertainment was provided during the evening by a large\npolice sergeant, an enraged landlady, fu riou o neighbours,\nand a piano full eight feet high.\nRags went out years ago, but we like to do\nsomething for the fresher s, One of the happiest\nthings about them is their cape olt y for being\nretold; for the Rag in progress is often rather\ndull and long winded, and always very artificial. X remember howling with laughter on being\ntold about tm Rag of all time: how some students dressed as labourers unloaded a heap of\nroad-mending tools in Piccadilly Circus, then dug\nup the road, diverting all the traffic, and than\nwent hone.\nA while ago I heard about the smart,\ncourteous, well-spoken student who approached a gentleman strolling in Clubland, and asked him\nif he \"would mind holding the end of this tape,\nwhile X carry the other end round the comer.\nSurveying, you know.\" The gentleman was vary\nobliging, but, twenty minutes later, grew restive)\nand went round the corner to register a wall brad\ncomplaint. He was astonished to find * similar\ngentleman standing a few yards away, patiently\nholding tho other end of the tape.\nHowever neither of these unfortunate victims\nof student humour was quite so surprised as a Birmingham student who, returning to College\nafter a doubtful week-end, found that his oar had\nbeen dismantled and reassembled in his bedroom.\nIt is also rumoured that a friend of his, who complained at the uncomfortable quality of this joke.\nhad occasion to go home a few weeks later, leaving\nhis oar in Birmingham. His return to College was\ngreatly ao eel a rated by the arrival by post, at his house, of sections of his car.\nOur own \"29\" Club has an increasing reputation\nfor work with paint and footprints. Nevertheless,\nlooking into the past, it seems that it is not\noriginal. Birmingham again. Two years ago dawn\nbroke on a public square where stood statues of\nthe mighty dead. A set of footprints in whit*\npaint were seen on the square. They led down Off\none of the pedestals, into a urinal, out, and beak\nup to the pedestal. On another ooo as iona fountain in the same square poured froth all over\nthe road. The water had been treated with detergent .\nThe yarns are endless. Most old students\ncould tell you half a dozen, all mu oh better than\nthese. The London Speoial is Ho kidnap somebody\nelse's mascot, and send it to Edinburgh, or round\nthe Inner Circle. \"Reggie\" of King's College is said to have spent several days on a tube train a couple of years ago. Imperial College generally\nhas no Hags at all Except- Bonfire Night. Pour years ago the\nI.C. Annual Bonfire was held on the road behind\nthe Albert Hall. Naturally enough, the road,\nw hio his made of tarred wooden blocks, caught firm,\nThere was a memorable struggle with poli ee and\nfiremen. Hose pipes figured in tugs of war, and\nwere turned on the crowd. Eleven students were\ncarried away in Black Marias, and were fined.\nI.C. was in disgrace; th\u00a9 Authorities clamped down. Any student arrested the following\nbonfire night, was to be sent down. A grave\nPresident laid down the sepulchral law in funereal\ntones. Wo had a quiet bonfire on the Rector's lawn (the then mate land opposite the Union), and\nthen wont en j aaaa e toPi oo a dll ly, blocking the\nroads, and lifting up oars. More grave Presidents\nand we spent the following two years relatively\nquietly at Harlington.\nRags went out when the Income Tax went up;\nwhen the wealthy could no longer send their sons\nto College for fun. We have our occasional\nletting offs of steam, but they are not the real\nthing. Purgatory and the Army, and June examinations are always too near.\nStill, things are not too bad. Morphy My is racing towards us. Bonfire night is almost\nupon us, and looking at FELIX, I note that three\nyears ago thin week one of our students climbed\nthe Albert Memorial and left a red.lamp on top-He was carried a we v, of course.\nIn a Marie,\nm "

The results were a creditable\nreflection not only upon the keene s s of the club members but\nalso on the club playing strength.\nThe first XV were the only unsuccessful side, but\ntheir narrow defeat at the hands of Wasps Vandals team, did them great credit. The forwards played valiantly against\na heavier ami more experienced pack and the backs tackled\nhard and relentlessly.\nThe second XT .beat Q.M. C.2 nd XV by 27 points to nil. The A XV. after a late cancellation and fixture rearrangement\nwhich led to much confusion, won 12-0 and against Old\nGran ni arians and. the 3 rA and B XVs were winners by 9-0\nand 16-3 respectively.\nThe dauntless 0 XV scored a resounding -victory by 15,\npoints to 14.

The standard of Eookey is very hi j h, when we consider that no less than five I.C. men\nplayed regularly fo* the University last season. True\nthis does have an adverse effect on I.C. hookey since\nit is never possible to field the best team available, but it is nevertheless a great compliment to\nI.C. hookey that ti his is so. Jim Tayler himself ekes oat an existence in the\nChemistry Dept. of the R.C.S. At the moment he is engaged in a little research into \"The Insecticides\nobtained from Natural Products\" with the accent on\n\"Isobutyl amides\"( Whatever they may be!) Jim la a quiet kind of cove, who rig on ou sly denies that he is in fact a secret extrovert. He came to I.C. from\nChippenham School in the Ootober of 1950, ha vine there also held the position of captain of Hockey.\nHe arrived just In time to miss the Hookey Club's Holland Sour which takes place every four years;\nHowever he does; tape to go on the next tour.\nOn the field, his usual position is at inside\nforward , but so far this season he has played in the centre position. He works the ball well, and is very apt at finding breaches in the opposite defence.\nAt the moment he is the principle scorer for the I.C. first team, having cured as light slowness in shooting which he squired last season. His other\ninterests range from \"Hops* to Tennis, Cricket and\nSquash, a pretty normal selection for anybody at\nI.C.J imT a vl erIs popular both in the Hockey Club ,\nand in the Union. As a captain he may seem a little a low in congratulating hie men on their play, but\nthey know that any praise they reo i eve from him on\nthe field really means something and.is not to be\nmistaken for the hollow compliments which so often\nfly around the field of sport. This page wishes Jim Tayler and t ne Hoeltey Club\nthe best of luck in the \"coming season. ' \u2022 ^\nThis year should b*a successful one. Many new\nplayers, par J6. cula rly he p poor d, Harris, the Leiwis Bros, and\nbarren show j sio h promise.

Little did we know that those coverlets\nconcealed the most hideous assortment of filthy rags ever\n3old by a TTkrainiaabeggar to a Chinese seaman for the\npurpose of cleaning boilers. We deposited these rags\nout aide the landlady''3 door, whence they disappeared over-night.

During the last year, many Words !\nwere written and spoken telling us that 1953 was to be \u00ab\n'truly Imperial year.'' However only one rag, other than the! annual events, took place. Even this had to be saved from j becoming an anticlimax, by the 'Guild's Karch'. j. It is thus obvious that, so far, this committee has J failed in its self allotted tack. 3e fore the Rag committee I c.:_n succeed it mU3t be supported officially by the Union. |\nAlternatively, \u00ab new.o or a a it tee should'be formed, preferably I made of th oae who have nt lost the.art of acting without j 'an un neoS f^aa ry amount of discussion.

With these qualifications iI am sure, you will find me unfitted for any post. I.

J Tours fitfully, Hier animus Bosoh.\nSilver Collectioii.:. for Lunch hour Concerts Dear Sir, There has been fairly widespread criticism of the practice adopted by the Musical Society, of making a Silver Collection at Lunch hour Concerts. The committee would like to reply to these criticisms as expressed in Felix, by first outlining the policy of the series of recitals, and secondly explaining how this policy is conditioned by financial restrictions. It is the aim in giving these concerts to firstly encourage the performance of music at a high standard within the college, and secondly to encourage the appreciation of music, by providing a few concerts( two or three per term), at the highest possible standard, given by professional musicians. The services of the latter are given for a nominal sum; a sum in fact to cover expenses, but this is still by no means a negligible figure. Even to give a recital involving only students, the cost is by no means zero, for there are always incidental expenses. Hence, the decision that has to be taken with regard to the cost of these concerts, is 'How much money from the S. C.C. grant can be\nvoted for them, without curtailing any of the other equally valuable activities of the Society; a pti vi ties such as the choir, orchestra, and the library. If the cost of the recitals draws too heavily on our resources, then the subscriptions paid by other members of the Society, for example\nthe choir members, becomes unreasonably high.-It is deemed unfair that these other members\nshould sub sid is e the recitals with which they have no direct connection. The committee believe that a fair balance can be achieved by covering about half the cost of these concerts from the S. C.C. grant and asking the concert goers to contribute the deficit. In this way the standard of the recitals can be maintained, without any\n'indue strain on the Society as a whole. However the committee would like to make it quite plain that to give or not to give to the collection is left entirely to the individual's discretion. There is no moral obligation to give 'something to the pot', if you have been to one of the concerts. But the concerts cost money, and\nwe believe that we may fairly ask that the half cost of them be provided by the concert goers. In spite of this it is better that the Council Room should be full, and the pot empty, than that both should be half full, the missing half of the audience having been put off by the thought of yet further financial demands.\nFinally may we say that we are the first to regret to have to ask for even a voluntary collection; to us the freer the music in Imperial College, the better. Tours faithfully, A. J. Fry, President.. Music alSo t fie ty. Dear Sir, It is with great emphasis that I wish to refute the\n-, allegations of Mr. Michael Baty, published in your last issue, that Hostel res iei eh ts in general are opposed to the\n\"serving of breakfast in the Refectory to. non-residents.\nSince my own residence in the Hostel dates only from\nthis term, I. do not presume to represent Hostel opinion;\nbut in my conversation with both residents and nonresidents since last term when the matter was first raised,\nnot one man or woman has voiced the opinion that the rule\nat present in force should remain. Further, no clause in\nthe*rationing or catering regulations can be advanced as a reason for preventing any Union member - or his guest -from buying\", a px-oper meal in the Refectory at any time when\nit is open. The present rule has no basis either upon\nlaw or upon opinion: let us then have it removed without\ndelay. It is offensive to our sense of fair play, and it la a skeleton in our cupboard which I for one would rather\nnot hear being rattled by my friends from outside the\nCollege. \u2022\nFinally I wish to thank Mr. Baty through your colts mo for blaming the affair on the Hostel residents; it was that\nprick which spurred me on to write in support of his cause.\nI firmly believe that not one resident deserves Mr. Baty's remarks, and I earnestly hope that Mr. Baty will have the\nright to treat himself era?, hi partner to breakfast at College after the Comr.. . Bell. It is a right which\nshould not need to be fought for._ \u2014\nlou rsf sl th fully,. Soger G \u00a9\u00bbSX\u00aby.j( Md Hostel.)\n\n"

Circulations 1208.\nA letter was published in the last FELIX complaining\nabout the breakfast regulations at present in force in the\nUnion refectory. Several people have pointed out that\nHostel';residents are firmly opposed to these regulations,\nand do not ask for more privileges as suggested by the\nauthor. Same - very few, admittedly, - argue that\nbreakfast is a meal meant expressly for Hostel residents and\nnot for the Union as a whole.

Baty has received a reply from\nsomebody who is connected with the running of the Refectory.\nWhat the letter says, whether it is an apology, an explanation,\nor a rebuttal we don't know and in faf tt that is besides the\npoint. It is the accepted'rule that all accusations\" made in any letters to the.. 23d ft or are replied to in the same columns.\nWriting personally to the author is just not done. Why\nthen was FELIX left out of this question? People write\nletters to newspapers because they concern something that\nis of interest to the general reader, because tj hey feel that r sore people should know about it.. Many letters to\n'FELIX originate in the discussions going on in the Bar or\nthe lounge, when somebody thinks that more people than'\nthose within earshot should know the views or- complaints\nor suggestions that he has to put forward. Well a j fid proper. Now if another person feels differently, or feels\nthat he is responsible for replying to that letter, i mediate ly puts pen to paper and sends it to the newspaper\nfor publication. This is normal practice.\nThe Refectory on the other hand seems to have different\nideas. The question of breakfast for Union members is not\na remote one, or one concerning a very limited number of\nstudents. . it at her more, it is a principle, and not\n\"merely breakfast, that is involved. Surely if they have\nto say something on the matter JELIX is the place to say\nit. They might have, an explanation regarding those\nregulations, in which case it should be put forward frankly\nand squarely before the student /body.

Last week, guilds held a union meeting. Most people\nwould have called it a fireworks display. Not so long ago,\na union meeting was an occasion for witty debate; if a subject -was up for discussion a fellow was expected to\npersuade the union by the logic of his argument and not, as\nis the case nowadays, by blasting out the other persons views\nwith 'penny b angers'. The new session seems to he-ie brought forth a great\nmany of these incendiaries. We hear of them at the hops and\nat the Mines fresher s dinner where they treated the one they\ncaught as all such hooligans should be treated. Too many of\nour ' letting off steam' activities axe little more than\nhooliganism. Too seldom do wa hear of incidents which display\nsome originality. The worthwhile rags are usually those with some fore\nthought and as organised rags axe frowned upon at I.C. perhaps\nit is to be exp acted that our outbursts of student ex huber a nee should tend -towards hooliganism. But events in the past few\nweeks show that some members of I.C. have reached a new peak\nin rowdyism. It was only last y fa&r that some misguided\ncharacter was made to apologize for throwing part of a lavatory cistern at the president of Guilds during one of\ntheir union meetings. Yet. nowadays, it seams to be considered\nthe thing to throw as many fireworks as the duration of the\nmeeting'will allow.\nThis sudden decline in behaviour seems to indicate\nthat mu oh of the blame lays with the fresher s. The fresher s seem to think that I.C. is the place to continue their\nschoolboy pranks of the sixth form which they have recently\nleft. Hence it is up to the seo on d and third year men to show\nthe fresher s how to behave at a university - and if example\ndoes h't teach them, perhaps the Mines method will convince\nthem of the folly of their ways.\n\u201e Never let it be thought that explosions, in general,\nare to be deplored. Used occasionally, and with some thought,\nan explosion is an excellent thing. And this applies to the\ncacophony of horns, bugles etc. that often drown the words of\nthose who do attempt to give soma meaning to a union meeting.\nOn occasions, such diversions are very useful but\ncontinually to blow or operate these instruments detracts\na lot from their effect.\nA union meeting is to discuss any matter that concerns -the mem be is of that union. Such matters are the provision of\nitems on the top floors of the various colleges (Mines have\ngot theirs; Guilds are still waiting). All of us will reap\nthe benefits nf these installations which would not have\nbeen possible if the conditions at our present union i had prevail ec in the past. Fusilier.\nFASHION CORNER\nHOW TO HE SMART AT I.C. Whilst agreeing that most of the people you\nsee at I.C. closely resemble walking rag bags, I will say that there are some whose appearance at\nleast does them some or ed lt. You may be able to\nstand that greasy pair of corduroy bags up In the\ncorner at night, but there are certain other\naspects to a pair of trousers that to my mind are\na little more desirable. Of course, if yon are\nin the habit of rolling about in the gutter, or\nmaybe sleeping in Council dustbins then you might\nas well not read this art iole, because a greasy\npair of bags will be far better for you anyway.\nTo be smart in I.C. as in all o iv? liz ed so'oie tle a, you have to conform to certain patterns\nof dress. The average oha p pie at I.C. conforms\nto a general pattern in that his everyday wear is some kind of sports oo at; however, if he wishes\nto be really in the fashion he wears a smartly\ncut Bookstall Blazer together with some brightly ^\npolished-brass buttons and sc^e sort of oo lle ge insignia on his top poo ket. Invariably he wears\na pair of trousers, partly for decency's sake in summer time and for warmness' sake in winter tine.\nEnglish Worsted and Gaberdine seam to be the new\nseason's' trend, boys; and by the \"fay note the\nEdwardian trend in imitation drain-pipes; they\nseem to be all therage at the Royal School of\nArts, where It is becoming increasingly difficult to distinguish between the two sexes. The\nfemale me mfc ers have not succeeded in cultivating\nbeards yet, so at least we have one yardstick to\ndistinguish the lambs from the goats.\nFor shoes, the best type to wear are the\nfelt top crepes, wh i oh not only require little or\nno cleaning but also do not need to go to the\noo bbl ers until you can feel the pavement under\nyour tootsie s. To look pretty round the neo k wear one of the oo lle get ies,. but a silk square\nof some loud ana garish hue will do just as well.\nHeadpieces of the tr il by type are rare in I.C., but if you do really suffer from o olds in the\nhead, a' little corduroy ' flat 'at' will do.\nDuffles are fairly common in I.e., but raincoats\ngenerally fit the issue for the average bod.\nThus in this brief survey I have given yon,\nas the Ann\u00ae Edwards of I.C.,a brief resume of\ncurrent foibles in dress. Not that I expect\nany of you to take e great deal of notice of what\nI have written, be ca,;,:...... you've probably\nattached to that sports oo at you've been\nnow for a few yea.., and niet her time,\nor leather pato he s on the elbows will high mutual regard that you have for each other.\nFrom Tour Seville Row Spy,\nSamuel\n\n"
