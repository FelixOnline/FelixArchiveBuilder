This new album hails a\nU-turn in their music direction, with\nharder and faster guitar playing and\nan unmistakable Black Sabbath in-fluence, clashing on stage with thier\nold \u2018Led Zepplin\u2019 style classic rock.\nRead any review of Wolfmother and\nyou\u2019ll undoubtably find a comparison to Led Zepplin, and with good\nreason. All their riffs and singing\nstyles, they seem to have borrowed\nfrom 70\u2019s rock royalty and then sold\nback at a resonable price with an\naustralian twist. Its kind of like a\nsubway sandwich doing low fat fish\nand chips, and somthing just doesn\u2019t\nfeel right.\nAnyway, although they\u2019re an easy\nband to musically tear apart, the truth\nof the matter is they deliver incread-ibly tight psy-rock and the punters\nRock so hard his own face is melting\nlove it.

Classical rock is a nice\njuxtaposition to the modern music\nscene, where new bands strive to\nmake their music more punchy and\nfresh, and its appeal is obvious to any\nyoung soul runined by dubstep. But\nI\u2019m not quite convinced that the solution is to copy great bands and create\ndated music that makes the Brixton\nAcademy feel like a pub gig.\nWolfmother\nThe O2 Academy Brixton\n21st January\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2729\u2729\n\n"

In addition to our teaching\nstrengths, we also beat both Oxford\nand Cambridge in the last assessment\nof research excellence. Students gain\na distinctive edge in the marketplace,\nand Imperial is a worldwide brand.\u201d\nThe higher education sector across\nthe world has been criticised in recent\nyears for focusing too much on league\ntables at the expense of less measurable marks of quality. Professor Begg\nexplained that the Business School has\navoided this: \u201cWe continue to enjoy\nforward momentum, and the spread\nof our reputation, but rankings are\nnot the whole story. For example, if we\nspecialised in investment banking, our\nstudents would get even higher salaries\nand our education ranking would rise\nas a result. But successful strategy entails being true to one\u2019s roots. We will\nalways have a strong role for innovation and entrepreneurship, even if this\nprevents us getting to the very top of\nthe MBA rankings.\u201d\nGiven the School\u2019s commitment\nto enterprise, it is ironic that like all\nuniversities, it depends on the Government for much of its funding. Professor Begg claimed to recognise the\nT\nhe Financial Times World\nRankings is one of the\nmost respected international league tables for\nBusiness Schools. In their\nlatest annual assessment, released\nthis week, Imperial College Business\nSchool has moved up seven places to\n32nd place in the world. Its Principal,\nProfessor David Begg, has given felix\nBusiness his thoughts on the School\nand its future plans.\nAlthough ICBS\u2019s overall FT ranking for 2010 is 32nd, Professor Begg\npoints out that, \u201cwithin the last two\nmonths, the Business School\u2019s Masters\nin Management has been ranked the\nbest Masters programme in the world\nfor entrepreneurship. Last Monday,\nthe Financial Times ranked our MBA\nprogramme the third best MBA in the\nworld for entrepreneurship - and also\nthe sixth best for economics and the\nseventh best for marketing.\u201d\nIt is clear that applying entrepreneurship to Imperial College\u2019s academic strengths across science, technology and medicine is central to the\nBusiness School\u2019s vision. Professor\nBegg believes that its main commitment is to \u201ccreating a world-class\nbusiness school that is as distinctive\nas Imperial itself. This means three\nthings - rigour, translation of scientific\nthinking into managerial applications,\nand acknowledged excellence.\u201d\nOf the School\u2019s plans for the fu-advantages of working with the private\nsector: \u201cImperial\u2019s avowed policy is\nto build other funding sources [than\nthe state] as quickly as possible, and\nthe Business School is at the forefont\nof development of deep commercial\nrelationships.\u201d\nAnother issue that many prospective\nstudents have with business schools is\ntheir high cost. Many studies have suggested that with so called \u2018degree inflation\u2019 caused by increasing numbers of\nstudents at universities, they may no\nlonger be a good investment. The ICBS\nPrincipal, however, begged to differ,\ndescribing the Imperial MBA\u2019s \u00a334,000\nprice tag as \u201ctremendous value\u201d and\ncountered the idea that the degree only\nmakes sense if someone else pays for\nit: \u201cFew of our full-time MBA students\nare sponsored. Most work for a few\nyears, then come back to achieve a step\nchange in their subsequent career.\u201d\nHe added that he is looking forward\nto greater achievements in the future\nfor the Business School by aiming to\ntake advantage of, and supporting,\nImperial College\u2019s existing areas of\nexpertise: \u201cThe Business School has\nbeen growing at 15 to 20% a year, and\nwe intend to continue to build on our\nrecent success.\u201d By 2020 he sees the\nBusiness School \u201cworking much more\nclosely with other faculties - on digital business, on risk, on sustainable\nenergy, and on advances in healthcare\nmanagement.\u201d\nICBS Principal, Professor Begg, who is frequently commissioned to advise national and supranational governmental\norganisations such as the Bank of England and the IMF, is pictured here meeting UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown.\nImperial College Business School:\nFACTS AND FIGURES\nTheSchoolismainlyactiveinfourareasofresearch-entrepreneurship\nand innovation, organisations and management, finance and\naccounting and healthcare management. Of these, it is particularly\nrenowned across the world as a leading academic center for\nentrepreneurship and innovation. ICBS maintains strong international\nlinks and has especially strong connections with India, whose 7th\nPrime Minister, Rajiv Ghandi, is a notable alumnus of the College. The\nSchool takes particular pride in its diversity and international outlook:\nWomen faculty 19%\nWomen students 16%\nWomen board 36%\nInternational faculty 74%\nInternational students 72%\nInternational board 55%\nInternational mobility rank 47\nInternational experience rank 75\nOf course there are many problems with facilitating so many students\nfrom so many countiries (and one in particular). But Professor Begg is\nconfident that the School is right to expose its members to this level of\ninternational diversity, \u201cour students will have to survive in a world of\nincreasing cultural diversity and we cannot shield them artificially. We\nhave however embedded more pedagogical technqiues - recording\nof lectures, web-based environments, that allow students to review\nlecture material in what may not be their first language.\u201d Despite the\nSchool\u2019s committment to maintaining its bredth of expertise rather\nthan specialising in investment banking, its students still have fairly\ngood career prospects:\nAverage salary US$120,306\nSalary percentage increase 107\nValue for money rank 17\nCareer progress rank 35\nAims achieved rank 71\nPlacement success rank 51\nEmployed at three months 85%\nAlumni recommend rank 67\nSome departments such as Electrical Engineering include compulsory\nmanagement modules delivered by the Business School. The School\nalso offers a range of optional courses on management, finance,\naccounting, enterprise and innovation to third and forth year\n\n"

The\npaper asks the Union to: Implement a\nban on smoking in any part of Union\npremises and a ban on the sale of tobacco by the Union and to lobby college to\nimplement a smoke free campus.\nDuring the meeting, concern was expressed that a ban on smoking in the\nQuad would result in smokers congregating by the entrance on Prince Consort Road or at the back of the Union\nbuilding near the Albert Hall. Anyone\nentering the Union would still have to\nwalk past smokers, as would pedestrians using the pavement.\nJohn Silver, Deputy President (Edu-cation) expressed his dislike of people\nsmoking in the Quad, implying he felt\nunable to ask them not to smoke near\nhim. He said that he was put off going into the Quad because he \u201cgets a\nface full of smoke\u201d every time he walks\nSmoking stubbed out on campus?\nthrough. This reporter wonders whether Mr Silver\u2019s dislike of walking through\nthe Quad may go some way to explain\nhis sporadic attendance at the office.\nA lot of people feel a student of Imperial College ought to be able to ask\nanother to alter their behaviour, if they\nsee it as offensive. As pointed out by\nnon-smoker, Jess Poore: \u201cIf it\u2019s got to\nthe point where we can no longer rely\non common courtesy and the ability to\nask someone to move away from you\nif you find them smoking unpleasant,\nand instead need to enforce school-like rules, we should be concerned\nabout the general conduct of our student population rather than a bit of\nsmoke.\u201d\nTalking to students around campus,\nit appears there is little support for a\nfull ban on smoking in the Quad, even\namong non smokers. Amanda Cheung\ntold felix: \u201cI think a full ban is a bit\nextreme but it would be nice if people who don\u2019t smoke could sit outside\nwithout having to breathe in cigarette\nsmoke, especially with the summer\ncoming. How about implementing\ndesignated smoking in the Quad?\u201d\nSmoker Matt Kaufeler joined a\nnumber of students in questioning the\nsanity of the motion telling felix: \u201cIf\nthis is anything more than an attempt\nto stimulate a debate on smoking, then\nit is idiocy. A short term ban would\nprobably be accompanied by a short\nterm boycott, which may lead to a long\nterm loss of custom\u201d\nThe meeting resolved not to pass\nthe paper, but to ask Council to vote\non whether to hold a referendum on\nwhether students want a smoke free\ncampus at the next Council meeting\non the 15th February. Any student may\nattend Council and voice their opin-ion, though only Council members can\nvote on whether to pass a paper.\nAside from soothing the sensitive\nnose of our DPE, many question the\nmotivation of the paper and whether\nthis is really one of the biggest Welfare\nissues affecting Imperial students. If\nthe aim is to improve the atmosphere\nof the Union, the pools of snakebite\nand vomit, odour of student and\ngeneral decor, should probably be\nattended to before smoke in the Quad.\nAlternatively, if the aim is to stop\nselling students products that may\nharm their health, I\u2019m sure the Union\nhas served me \u2018meals\u2019 that pose a far\nmore imminent danger to my\nhealth than a few\ncigarettes would.\nAliceRowlands\nAliceRowlands\nfelix 1,451\n29\n.\n01\n.\n10\nFelix, Beit Quad, Prince Consort Road, London SW7 2BB.

Barclays head Bob Diamond, and Lord Levene,\nchairman of the insurance market Lloyd\u2019s, have both lashed out at Barack\nObama\u2019s plans to break up banks \u2018too big to fail\u2019. Mr Obama\u2019s proposals, which\nneed congressional approval, would also prevent banks or financial institutions that own banks from owning hedge funds and bar them from proprietary trading. Lord Levene was quoted as saying that \u201cWe need good regula-tion, better regulation but not more regulation.\u201d\nThe world beyond\nCollege walls\nBy Raphael Houdmont & Tom Greany\nI\nn Sri Lanka\u2019s first presidential election since victory in the\ncivil war against the Tamil Tigers, the incumbent Mahinda\nRajapaksa has been declared winner with a majority of 57.8\npercent.\nBeing the first President to have led a successful campaign against\nthe Tigers, it may have seemed that Mr. Rajapaksa was in no threat of\nlosing his post. But his main rival in the race was General Fonseka,\nthe head of the army during the war, who got 40% of the votes.\nSoon after the results were announced by the Electoral Commission,\ntroops were deployed around the hotel where General Fonseka was\nstaying. The General has since lodged a complaint to the Electoral\nCommission alleging vote rigging.\nSri Lanka\nD\nays of violence between Christians and Muslims in the city\nof Jos, Nigeria, have left nearly 500 people dead.\nThe riots started in Jos, but then spread to neighbouring\ntowns, and dozens of houses, churches, and mosques have\nbeen burnt down. Police are still removing bodies from wells\nand pits, whilst residents are fleeing to military camps set-up around the city.\nThis is not the first time the city has experienced such trauma. Indeed, an\nestimated 200 people were killed in religious clashes in the city in late 2008.\nThe political situation in Nigeria isn\u2019t helping the situation either. It\u2019s President, Umaru Yar\u2019Adua has been in hospital in Saudi Arabia for two months,\nand the Senate has called on him to concede his powers to his deputy, to allow\nhim to take up presidential duties.\nNigeria\nSwitzerland\nU\nnder mounting political pressure, Tim Geithner, U.S.\nTreasury secretary, testified on Wednesday for the bailout\nof AIG, the world\u2019s largest insurer.\nSpecifically in question are AIG\u2019s payouts of collateral-ised debt obligations (CDOs) at full value to undisclosed\ncounter parties, who were comprised mostly of large banks. As a result,\nmany politicians and pundits are labelling the bailout a further opaque handout to banks. Geithner defended the bailout of AIG and the measures taken\nto uphold its credit rating as \u201cabsolutely essential.\u201d This testimony and the\nuncertain confirmation of Federal Reserve chief Ben Bernanke for a second\nterm come amid a rising wave of populism in the U.S. and elsewhere, affecting\nglobal politics and economic reform.\nUnited States\n\n"

Eliot\nBarford takes a retrospective look at the\nre-release of Bowie\u2019s debut album\nWho\u2019s afraid\nof the big bad\nwolf?\nI\n\u2019m afraid of the big bad wolf,\nthe wolf in this context, it being\nthe looming power of the music\nindustry, in all its underesti-mated, dream crushing glory. It\nis an enormous hive of killer bees that\nmeddles where it needn\u2019t meddle and\nseems to be ever growing. It feeds from\nthe excitement and enthusiasm of\npretty young things, before devouring\nthem and leaving the carcasses for music journalists such as myself to pick at\nuntil a page in a newspaper is filled. To\nsay I have no grudge against the music\nindustry would be a painful lie but, a\nfirst hand account is surely worth more\nthan rumours.\nI once heard an amazing quote by\nElvis Costello which said, \u201cMusic journalism is like dancing about architecture\u201d. This is something that almost\ncan\u2019t be done, an art in itself because\nmusic is to express what words can\u2019t.\nThis would be true if the raw musical\nmaterial from so many recording artists was left as it was. Instead much\nof the music nowadays is subject to\nnot only months, but years of being\nchurned through the meat grinder\nby the killer bees, leaving it overproduced and souless. Song writing,\na demo, live performance, rehearsal\nand an album are the steps that ought\nto be taken that would allow the music\nsomeone makes to naturally develop.\nI\u2019m not saying this shouldn\u2019t be a rocky\nroad with an incredible amount of\nwork put in, but it shouldn\u2019t be an execution of creativity, as it is now.\nThere is a huge aura of fear that surrounds the \u2018top dog\u2019 of a record label,\nbut in my opinion, fear arises from the\nability for them to do harm to you in\nsome way, and this is what happens\nmore often than not. It\u2019s the musicians\nwith the songs, the look, the influence,\nthe passion and most importantly the\ncreativity, everything these people\nprobably lack. It\u2019s true to say that they\nhave the power and don\u2019t need you,\nbut they need new musicians and it\nshouldn\u2019t be them to decide who the\nmusicians they need are.\nA friend of mine was signed to a successful American record label (they will\nremain anonymous to preserve their\ndignity), as a drummer in a band and\nwas set to record in their studios. Before the studio time, he was informed\nby them not to turn up to the sessions\nas they were going to employ a session\ndrummer to record his part, however\nhis name will appear on the record.\nThis is the type of music crimes that\nare being committed by the big men in\nsuits, who care not for the music, but\nthe money, and how to make more of it\nby wringing out the wide-eyed, bushy\ntailed innovators.\nWhat I want to see, is an album created by a handful of people, in one\nmonth without computers. If to you\nthis seems impossible, come back to\nEarth, it\u2019s music not a shuttle launch.\nThat will be the music that captures a\ngeneration, \u2018That\u2019ll be the day\u2019.\nLuke Turner\nLuke Turner Music Editor\nReviews\nThis is classic HIM, with a touch more\nsanity. This single is extremely tight in\nall aspects. The sound of crunching\nguitars under an American pop-style\nvocal, with pauses to accentuate the\nlack of dynamics throughout. It feels to\nme as if this is HIM on a leash, out for\na Sunday walk, but it can\u2019t be denied\nit does call for a night of rock. It must\nbe said the lyrics lack something when\n\u2018come hither\u2019 is a theme. -Luke Turner\nThis new single writhes with dirty electronic sounds laid underneith a humble choir hum. A well structured song\nthat catches your ears with heavy layering and distorted sounds. This is not\nbreakthrough music, not hugely interesting but it has spirit and a feeling of\nfight. A nice follow-on from prievious\nmusic of theirs. - Luke Turner\nTHE BIG PINK\nVELVET\n4AD\nSINGLE\nThis is handmade hip-hop in a simple form with jovial uses of a sampler.\nRapid vocals with laid back break-beat\ndrums, this has a vintage sound despite\nits recent release. A gentle, sweetly\ncontained album that is just the right\namount of Belleruche, any more may\nbring on a repetitive itch, but a talented group of musical minds.\n- Luke Turner\nBELLERUCHE\nTHE LIBERTY\nTRU THOUGHTS\nALBUM\nBringing back the quirky sounds of\nindie guitar, this song is filled with\nlayered clean guitar riffs. It\u2019s pure in\na dirty way, mainly due to the politely\nrestrained vocals singing truths of the\nhuman race. This song is pretty guitars\nand a pretty vocals with impressive\ndrumming. - Luke Turner\nANIMAL\nKINGDOM\nTWO BY TWO\nWARNER MUSIC\nUK\nSINGLE\nA jazzy fusion of Ray LaMontagne and\nPaulo Nutini, Krystle Warren uses her\nbeautiful voice in a range of ways to\nvary her music. This is feel-good and\nlaid back to its very definition, \u2018Three\nWomen\u2019 a smile in musical form. Gentle acoustic guitar and crisp clear vocal matched up with an upright bass in\n\u2018Title Track\u2019 speaks soulful music. This\nis quite refreshing to hear whilst reviewing albums in the felix office during sports night at the union, maybe I\u2019d\nrather be here when it\u2019s music like this\nthat\u2019s my subject,and a pint of Guiness.\nBeautiful. - Luke Turner\nKRYSTLE\nWARREN\nCIRCLES\nBECAUSE\nMUSIC\nLP\nHIM\nHEARTKILLER\nSIRE RECORDS\nSINGLE\nA powerful combination of musical\nrebels, amplifiers, and a damaged voice\ngives rise to The Smoking Hearts. This\nis angry punk rock which despite it\u2019s\nclearly audible passion, fails to vary a\nhuge amount throughout. This loud\nfive-some are having a ball of a time\nplaying this music, and metal-lovers\nwill enjoy this true to the form album.\n-Luke Turner\nA blur of speed and distorted sounds,\nthis album is musically intelligent but\ntrue to it\u2019s album name, an abyss. A\ndeep sounding melancholic mash of\nsouds that quite often don\u2019t match\nwell, full of dischord; it is individual\nbut not my cup of tea. -Luke Turner\nSERENA\nMANEESH\nNO 2: ABYSS IN\nB MINOR\n4AD\nALBUM\ntell us what you\nthink, music.felix@\ngmail.com\nS\no David Bowie\u2019s eponymous\ndebut album is getting the\nre-release treatment, with\na Disc 2 filled with A-sides,\nB-sides and stuff that didn\u2019t\nmake it to release. Is it worth your\ntime? Well, some have put it down as\na misstep better forgotten, but I think\nit\u2019s more than that. That\u2019s not to say it\ndoesn\u2019t have its blemishes though.\nAs Bowie\u2019s very first LP it should\nspark interest in any fan of the man.\nIts songs are a mixture of orchestrated\nballads and music hall yarns with a few\nsomewhere in between. The first, \u201cUncle Arthur\u201d, is a cheesy, innocent, characteristically British tale. The next, my\nfavourite, is the melancholic \u201cSell Me a\nCoat\u201d and its graceful vocal melodies.\n\u201cLove You Till Tuesday\u201d will make you\ncringe with its menacing refrain and\nreek of \u201clight entertainment\u201d. \u201cThere Is\na Happy Land\u201d looks as Bowie\u2019s idea of\nchildhood idyll. The album progresses\nthus, between good pop/rock songs\ncoming more questionable tracks. Top\nof this pile is the B-side \u201cThe Laughing\nGnome\u201d, which almost needs no expla-nation. Terrifyingly, despite its pun on\n\u201cLondon School of Eco-Gnomics\u201d, this\nsong became a Top 10 hit after Ziggy\nStardust came out!\nWhat about the new stuff? While the\nstereo mixes eliminate the mono\u2019s period quality, they might enrich the experience if you ever want to revisit it.\nMost of the unreleased material and Bsides are mediocre, but \u201cThe London\nBoys\u201d deserves note as a noirish look at\nMod excesses. The BBC sessions largely rehash what is present on the album.\nVerdict? I honestly quite like it, but\nlots of Bowie devotees will probably\nfind it embarrassing. I think it\u2019s intriguing to see where this \u201cpop genius\u201d\ncame from, and it\u2019s all there: the sto-ries, the theatricality, even the dystopian messiah-fantasy (\u201cWe Are Hungry\nMen\u201d). Above all, David Bowie shows\nthe man experimenting with existing\ntropes to deliver more than just a sonic\nexperience, and isn\u2019t that what made\nhim famous when he transformed into\nZiggy Stardust?\n550\nApproximately the number\nof songs David Bowie has\nwritten throughout his carrer.\n1966\nThe year David Bowie\nchanged his name from\nDavid Robert Jones to\nDavid Bowie.

There is, how-ever, one thing which I envy about\nFrance: the way the French Republic\nsticks to its principles \u2013 mostly.\nThis week, a French parliamentary\ncommittee published its report recommending a ban on wearing veils which\ncover the face in public places. This\nis the latest episode in a movement\nwithin France to stop the wearing of\nthe niqab, which the French press\nand government is belligerently, and\nwrongly, calling the burqa. The niqab\nis a full body veil with slits for the eyes.\nThe burqa, a full body-and-face covering garment with a mesh allowing the\nwearer to see, is from Afghanistan and\nall but unseen in France.\nLast year, President Sarkozy made\nthe first presidential address to parliament in 136 years. The speech was\nbroad and wide-ranging, and until that\nyear had been banned to protect the\nseparation of powers in France. This\nalone sparked controversy, especially\nas it was held at the Palace of Versailles\nleading some to perceive connotations\nof monarchy and a thirst for increased\npresidential power. However, the real\ncontroversy was not the move towards\na king-like president, such as the position has become in America, but from\na few remarks that Sarkozy made.\nIn his address, he stated that \u201c[the\nburqa] will not be welcome on French\nsoil... We cannot accept, in our coun-try, women imprisoned behind a\nmesh, cut off from society, deprived of\nall identity. That is not the French republic\u2019s idea of women\u2019s dignity.\u201d\nSince then, the wheels have been set\nin motion in this further progression\ntowards a secular nation. Secularism,\nor \u2018la\u00efcit\u00e9\u2019 as the concept is known\nin France, is part not just of the cul-ture, but part of the constitution.\nWearing \u2018conspicuous\u2019 religious\nsymbols was banned in schools in\n2004. It follows then that France\nshould forbid the wearing of\nsuch a prominent religious symbol as the niqab. What is inter-esting, though, is that many of\nthe arguments for forbidding\nthe burqa revolve around security concerns and the difficulties in cultural integration\nof someone who cannot be\nseen, rather than in further\nremoval of religion from\nthe state. People pressing for the ban commonly point out, just as\nSarkozy has, \u201cThe burqa\nis not a religious sign\u201d\nand that \u201cneither the\nburqa, nor the niqab,\u201d\nas Dalil Boubakeur,\nrector of the Paris\nMosque says \u201cnor\nany all-over veil, are\nreligious prescriptions of Islam.\u201d\nFrance is currently home to over 5\nmillion Muslims, the largest Islamic\npopulation of any European nation,\nmost of whom are ethnically descended from North Africa where Muslim\nwomen don\u2019t typically wear veils that\nfully cover the face. Reports suggest\nthere are approximately 1900 women\nwho currently wear the niqab or burqa\nin France. Sources claim that 90% who\ndo are under 40, 2/3 are French nationals and nearly \u00bc are converts. This\nmeans that the vast majority of those\nwearing the full veil are women whose\nmothers did/do not wear the full veil,\nfrom which it has been concluded that\nthe increase in women wearing the\nveil in France is not from immigration\nof people from the Gulf, but from the\ngrowth of ultra-puritan Islam amongst\nthe population.\nWhether the ban will actually materialise is another matter. The expected\ncourse is for the report to be followed\nby the drafting of a bill and a debate in\nparliament. The main opposition party\nhas stated it is against the ban, and the\nfar-right movement led by Jean-Marie\nLe Pen has said a ban is unnecessary as\nFrench law already prohibits being out\nin public with a mask on.\nfive men at the centre of the case have\nbeen living off \u00a310 a week in cash and\nrequire special permission for other\nexpenses. The judgement has been\nsuspended for a month by the court,\nallowing the government to change\nthe law to lawfully freeze alleged terrorist assets. The two orders to freeze\nassets were brought in by Gordon\nBrown when he was Chancellor of the\nExchequer.\nIn the ruling, the Supreme Court justices said that if the government wanted to take \u201cfar-reaching measures\u201d to\ncombat terrorism, then approval from\nParliament is needed. Lord Hope said:\n\u201cEven in the face of the threat of international terrorism, the safety of\nthe people is not the supreme law. We\nmust be just as careful to guard against\nunrestrained encroachments on personal liberty\u201d. He continued that the\nTreasury had exceeded its powers in\nhow it had devised and implemented\nthe Terrorism Order. \u201cThis is a clear\nexample of an attempt to adversely affect the basic rights of the citizen without the clear authority of Parliament,\u201d\nhe said.\nLord Hope said that one of the five\nmen, Mohammed al-Ghabra, had been\ndenied a basic right to challenge his\nrestrictions.\nIn the explanation of the judge-ment, Lord Phillips, president of the\nSupreme Court, said: \u201cNobody should\nconclude that the result of these appeals constitutes judicial interference\nwith the will of Parliament. On the\ncontrary, it upholds the supremacy of\nParliament in deciding whether or not\nmeasures should be imposed that affect the fundamental rights of those in\nthis country.\u201d\nA spokesman for the Treasury said\nthat it would attempt a change of legislation as soon as possible but would\nabide by the ruling.\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to be clear that this\nruling does not challenge the UK\u2019s\n\u201cThis is an attempt\nto adversely affect\nthe rights of the\ncitizen without\nthe authority of\nParliament\u201d\nobligations under the UN Charter to\nfreeze the assets of suspected terror-ists, which we will continue to meet.\nWe will introduce fast-track legislation\nto ensure there is no disruption to our\nterrorist asset-freezing powers.\u201d\n\n"

    "content": "15\nfelix FRIDAY 29 JANUARY 2010\nARTS\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nY\nou know how it is, you\nwait all term for a new\nmusical to open and finally one does. Two days\nbefore my exam. See what\nI sacrifice for you dear reader; who am\nI kidding? I needed a break and Legally Blonde the Musical was the perfect\nexcuse.\nThe Savoy theatre places host to\nthe show and is possibly one of the\nugliest theatres in London, built in a\ntribute to Art Deco it is more a lesson\nin dodgy concrete and tired looking\nvelvet curtains. I was hoping that the\nshow would be good enough to make\nup for the eyesore it played in and\nluckily I was right and even the many\ncrusty old critics around me agreed!\nIf you\u2019ve seen the film of Legally\nBlonde, the general storyline is the\nsame; Elle Woods, a sorority queen\nfrom Malibu strives to get into Harvard Law School in an attempt to\nwin back her ex-boyfriend Warner\nHuntington III but instead finds herself fighting to fit in and be taken se-riously. She is helped in her quest to\nbecome a lawyer by the dowdy but\nsweet Emmett and love-lorn Paulette.\nThe play takes this storyline and bulks\nit out a bit, adding a back-story for\nEmmett and expanding Paulette\u2019s love\nlife. This makes for a much more satisfying book and well-rounded charac-terisations lifting the story from shallow and girly to smart and funny.\nThe movie really suits musicalisa-tion, certain scenes were just screaming out to become large production\nnumbers and luckily the creative team\nhave chosen the right situations to\nreceive this treatment. The Bend and\nSnap has naturally become a hiphop inspired anthem with additional\ndance breaks and Elle\u2019s discovery of a\nkey witness\u2019s perjury is now emphasised in \u201cThere Right There\u201d (guess\nwhat that\u2019s about).\nLaurence O\u2019Keefe and Nell Benjamins\u2019 score is catchy and captures the\nfun of the show without being superficial and the lyrics are very witty with a\nsense that they are in on the jokes too.\nMusic wise, highlights for me were the\nballad \u201cLegally Blonde\u201d which I must\nadmit nearly made me cry and \u201cSo\nMuch Better\u201d, the act one finale that,\nin the hands of Sheridan Smith, gives\nWicked\u2019s \u201cDefying Gravity\u201d a run for\nits money. I must give a little shout out\nto O\u2019Keefe\u2019s orchestrations, full and\nbrassy is how I like my shows and full\nand brassy is what he gave me.\nJerry Mitchell\u2019s direction is fun and\nbouncy and makes great use of some\nbrilliantly designed mechanised sets,\nincluding a dormhouse frontage and a\nvery cleverly designed judge\u2019s podium\ncum toilet suite! His choreography\nis vibrant and incredible intricate, a\nstand out being \u201cWhipped into Shape\u201d.\nThis was a complex number involving\nsome amazing jump rope (or skipping\nrope for us Brits) stunts and a strong\nperformance by Aoife Mullholandow\nto the matter of the cast. I must admit that when first announced, I was\nincredibly sceptical- three TV person-alities, two reality TV hopefuls and a\npopstar does not fill one with much\nhope. For some reason in England a\nmusical cannot be successful without having a *star name* to entice Joe\nPublic in. Why can\u2019t a musical be sold\non the merit of its book and songs!?\nRant over. On the whole I was very\nimpressed with the casting and should\nlearn to be less sceptical. Sheridan\nSmith stole the show as Elle Woods,\nOmigod You Guys, like a New Musical!\nLucy Harrold finally gets to see a new show after a long theatre draught and luckily it\u2019s a rather awesome choice\nshe was phenomenal and even better\nthan Laura Bell Bundy on my well worn\nout cast recording. Her comic timing\nwas perfect yet did not hamper any of\nthe more serious moments and boy has\nthat lady got a voice! I loved Alex Gaumond as Emmett; his high note and little dance at the end of \u201cChip on Your\nShoulder\u201d sent me into a frenzied moment of \u201cawww, he\u2019s so cute\u201d. Another\nrevelation for me was Peter Davison\nas Professor Callahan, who I\u2019d never\nseen in any other role other than the\nfifth Doctor Who. \u201cBlood in the Water\u201d, a song I would normally skip on\nthe album was well executed by Davison who even added a jazzy lilt to this\npatter song.\nMy cynical predispositions were not\nentirely unrealised as I felt Jill Halfpenny, although a fine actress, was totally\nmiscast as Paulette. The part can be\ntaken in two ways- sassy yet vulnerable\nor playing for laughs. Halfpenny didn\u2019t\ndo either and didn\u2019t really have the belt\nto pull off Paulette\u2019s showstopper \u201cIreland\u201d. Duncan James, although he well\nsuited the part and sings very well, just\ndidn\u2019t seem right in the cast- whether\nthis was because he looks too old to\nbe at Harvard or that James isn\u2019t yet\ncomfortable in the theatre surroundings is yet to be seen. It doesn\u2019t help\nthat he has one of the weakest songs\nin the show and little else to do yet\nhas been the main feature of publicity\ncampaigns.\nDespite these few niggles I was really impressed with Legally Blonde, the\ncast were full of energy and genuinely\nappeared to be having a good time.\nThe play stays faithful to the fabulous\nfilm yet adds a new dimension and\nthe music is infectious without being\ngrating.\nThe show\u2019s unexpected draw was its\nheart. I truly did feel all warm inside\nby the end and this is a testament to\nthe entire package- writers, production team and cast. Perhaps a winter\nopening was a bonus to entice freezing\nshoppers off the streets and into the\ntheatre and I say good on them!\nIf you only have the opportunity to\nsee one movie musical this season,\nmake sure it is Legally Blonde, you\u2019ll\nfeel better for it. Plus it offers a lottery\nsystem where by turning up two hours\nbefore the show your name is entered\ninto a lottery. If you are pulled out you\ncan bag yourself some very cheap front\nrow seats. Yay for cheapness!\nWant to go to a show but its too pricey?\nEvery winter the Get Into London Theatre Initiative offers tickets\nto top shows for under 26s for bargain prices- \u00a310, \u00a315, \u00a325 or \u00a335!\nAnd these aren\u2019t just any old shows, these are top West End Shows.\nCurrent offer include \u00a360 Legally Blonde tickets for \u00a335 and \u00a350\nHairspray tickets now at \u00a325. For this you\u2019ll get a nice stalls seat and\nan awesome view. www.getintolondontheatre.co.uk\nDon\u2019t forget the \u201cA Night Less Ordinary\u201d Scheme where you can\nget free (yes free!) tickets to shows at selected theatres including\nthe National and the Donmar Warehouse. Again, all need to be is\nunder 26.\nwww.anightlessordinary.org.uk. Or we\u2019ll get you tickets if you\nwant to review a show, email us at arts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nLets play \u201cOne of these things is not like the others\u201d, any ideas? I\u2019ll give you a clue: Duncan from Blue doesn\u2019t count.\nThe incomparable Sheridan Smith as Elle Woods bags herself possibly the cutest guy ever in Alex Gaumond as Emmett\n\n"

It takes courage to wear bold shoulders to col-lege. When it comes to men\u2019s fashion,\nthere\u2019s only a very thin line between\nlooking stylish and looking like a\ntranny. A friend (male) almost died\nof shock when he saw a man wearing a pair of skinny jeans - turned up\nrevealing a red pair of socks and kept\nsnugged with a knee length mink fur\ncoat. He was definitely living at the\nfashion forefront in Shoreditch. Outside of Central London though, I\u2019m not\nsure if he\u2019d even survive\u2026\nThe Shoreditch crowd, for some\nbizarre reason, always seem to don\nmajor trends two seasons early. Look\nat the trend dominating the Autumn/\nWinter 2010 runway \u2013 furs, furs, furs,\nfurs - although they are pared down\nversions of the knee length coat seen\non the tranny-looking man. (Tranny?\nStylish?)\nAnyway, there are more plausible\nways of expressing your stylish self\nwithout selling out your manly de-Fashion and\nMen\nKawai Wong\nKawai Wong Fashion Editor\nmeanour. Saskia Verhagen returns this\nweek to fill us in on the latest know-hows in order to look nonchalantly\nstylish. Nonchalance - a word that men\nshould bear in mind while attempting\nany trend GQ may persuade you to\nfollow...\nLastly, just a thought, are gay men\ngenerally more stylish than straight\nmen? if so, are they are more prone to\nexpressing themselves creatively and\nartistically in terms of outerwear? If so,\nwhy is this? Do they simply not care or\nif they do, are they afraid of the inner\nfeminine side catching up with them?\nHaving said that, I\u2019d much prefer to\nhave the mirror to myself in the morn-ing, rather than having to force a style-obsessed boyfriend out of the way just\nto get a slice of the mirror.\nMy good friend Igor Ostrikov offers\nhis views on the straight versus gay issue on fashion: some gays dress over-the-top and they look hideous. Some\nof them go to fashion parties and they\nwear art but not clothes. On an everyday basis, ties are straights who dress\nas well as gays.\nSo there. The gays are still winning\nthe fashion marathon.\nFashion\u2019s Rugged Gentleman\nThe week of uber-eliticist fashion\nshows is back. The Spring 2010 season\nof the highly exclusive Paris couture\nshow ended on Thursday the 28th after\na short schedule of only 5 days.\n19 designers and classic fashion\nhouses completed the first four days\nof the schedule with the last day of the\nweek reserved for artistic jewellery.\nAt the time of going to print Valentino has just closed his show. The\ncollection featured vibrant and youthful short dresses that featured a lot\nof the classic Valentino fine draping\nand spiral-cut organza. Valentino has\nrenewed the idea of celebrating the\nwomanly curve by the brilliant draped\nmummy-like bodysuit. The use of a\nfluorescent palette which diverged\nfrom the widespread candy floss colours that have infested Spring (ready\nto wear as well as couture runways) is\nalso very refreshing.\nJean-Paul Gaultier\u2019s creations were\nheavily influenced by ethnic tribes in\ndifferent parts of the globe. Straws,\nchains, geometric origami, leaves,\nfeathers, spikes and leather pleating\nwith raw colours accompanied the\nusual Gaultier strong-edged, slightly\nfetishist style. Models looked like stylised tribeswomen coming straight out\nof an Amazon rainforest or a tribal\nconference in the rural part of Southeast Asia.\nEven Chanel has moved on from\nthe classic boucle and pearls. Models\ndonned sheer metallic leggings and\nLagerfeld-esque gloves in shiny silver-clad leather. Elie Saab continues to\nprove to the fashion world that he is\nthe man to look to if wedding dresses\nare in question. Galliano again went\nback to the Dior archive and created a\nNew Look dash Equestrian hybrid.\nParis Couture Roundup\nR\necently it has seemed\nlike the popular choice of\nsmart menswear has become rather banal. The\nlooks are tediously cookie-cutter; it\u2019s\nclose to impossible to differentiate\none insipid middle-class estate agent\nwith a bad suit and a worse personality from the next. My ideal personifies more than an external projection\nof \u2018smartness\u2019 \u2013 it requires a quiet\nconfidence, a quirk and a bit of internal angst. This is not your awful\ngeneric city boy \u2013 this is a damaged\nhero, a man with a purpose; the man\nwho left everything behind to explore the world, the cardiac surgeon\nwho fixed someone\u2019s broken heart \u2013\na man who embodies exactly what a\nman really ought to be: this is James\nBond, Rhett Butler, Rick Blaine \u2013\nrugged heroes with a tainted past\nand a fabulous wardrobe.\nThe rogue returns, shuns his daily\nuniform, and dons instead a flawless\nbespoke suit \u2013 but the nonchalantly\nruffled hair, the sense of insatiable\nintent, the subtle air of heroic arrogance are all main-tained. He becomes the\nperfect oxymoron \u2013\nsexily dishevelled\nand impeccably\nput-together; a\nman who seems not\nto care much for\nstyle, but knows\nenough about\nwhat looks good.\nHe has sufficient\nconfidence to\ncarry it off with\nthat enviable\nsemblance of, \u201cOh\nthis old thing?

    "content": "GileadAmitandtheabuseofsympathy\n9\nfelix FRIDAY 29 JANUARY 2010\nT\nhis has been a busy week on\ncampus. Imperial Christian\nUnion have been hosting\ntheir free thinking week,\nand the Palestinian Society\nhave organised a Gaza awareness week.\nAnd being a conscientious, participating member of the Union, I\u2019ve tried to\nget involved with all these conflicting\nactivities as best I can. I came to some of\nthe Christian Union events, ready for an\nargument and the free doughnuts, with\nmy fists clenched and my cheeks turned.\nI even went to some of my lectures.\nBut I haven\u2019t gotten involved with\nGaza awareness week, even though it\u2019s\na subject closer to my heart than Richard Dawkins or even the Foundations\nof Quantum Mechanics. And the reason for my silence is there hasn\u2019t been\nanything for me to say. One year ago,\nhundreds of people were dying in a\nhorrendous and avoidable war. Thousands of others suffered and the cause\nof peace has been irreparably harmed.\nThere should be time to grieve.\nBut grief cannot be isolated. Tragedy\ndoes not occur in a vacuum. We must\nlearnfromhorrorandatrocity,anddoour\nutmosttoensureitisneverrepeated.And\nwhen it comes to the Middle East, I think\nthe world is learning the wrong lessons.\nIsrael is far from irreproachable. It\nmakes political, strategic and humanitarian mistakes, and in my opinion it\nneeds to accept its share of the respon-sibility. But when we discuss the human\nrights situation in Gaza, we need to direct our criticism appropriately, and not\nbe blinded to the central issues at hand.\nSympathy with suffering, and indeed\neven suffering itself, are not certificates\nthat guarantee one is telling the truth.\nOne must try to look beyond emotions\nand beyond the feelings of sorrow we\nautomatically and instinctively extend\nto those who have been abused.\nThose who style themselves as pro-Palestinian speak very eloquently, and\nin great detail, of the human rights violations Israel inflicts upon the residents\nof Gaza. We constantly hear how the\nGazan population must endure Israeli\nsecurity checkpoints and searches, Israeli blockades on necessary goods and\nservices, and the constant threat of Israeli bombardment.\nWe rarely hear of the ongoing feuds\nbetween adherents of Hamas and followers of Fatah, feuds which in the\nduration of Operation Cast Lead alone\nkilled dozens and wounded many\nmore. We are seldom told of the plight\nof the Palestinian families who wait\nin terror lest militants commandeer\ntheir property or use their children as\nhuman shields to protect themselves\nfrom Israeli reprisals. Few stories reach\nus of the Palestinians whose buildings\nexplode when a next-door neighbour\nmakes a mistake in calibrating an explosive device; a device intended for detonation among Israeli schoolchildren.\nOver the past twenty seven years,\nover 6 billion dollars in aid have been\npoured into Gaza and the West Bank.\nEven during the Gaza war, Israel imported thousands of tons of medical supplies, fuel and grain into Gaza.\nEven when the ceasefires convoked to\nallow the safe passage of medical supplies were broken by Hamas militants.\nEven when aid lorries and ambulances\nwere hijacked and hospitals used as\nsafe zones by gunmen. Even when the\ntunnels leading out of Gaza were used\nto import weapons and explosives instead of medicine and food. The total\naid received by the Gazan population\nis over five times as much per capita\nas post-war Europe received under the\nMarshall Plan. And the Palestinians\nneed it. They deserve enough money\nto build the finest schools, maintain the\nmost advanced hospitals, and develop a\nflourishing Palestinian economy.\nSo why hasn\u2019t this happened? Why,\nin the years since Israel pulled its settlers out of every square inch of Gaza,\nhas the region not developed the best\nschools in the Middle East? Why are\nthere no hospitals in Gaza to rival those\nacross the border in Israel? Why have\ngardens left behind by the Israelis not\nbeen urged to give fruit to new masters?\nThe simple and depressing answer is\nthat munitions are expensive. One cannot build up an arsenal of rockets and\nexplosives while at the same time improving the education of one\u2019s children.\nIf the choice is guns or better living, we\nknow from experience which way the\nPalestinian leadership always swings.\nAnd why should they choose any dif-ferently? The less well-educated their\npeople\u2019s children are, the easier it will be\nto fill their heads with extremist, anti-Israeli dogma. The fewer hospitals are\nfunctional, the more obvious it will be to\nall in the sensitive, caring West that the\nIsraelis are irredeemably in the wrong.\nThere are thousands upon thousands\nof innocent Palestinians whose suffering is so great as to make description\nimpotent. But they have been callously,\ncynically and relentlessly abused at the\nhands of their supposed leaders. But if\nthe self-proclaimed Palestinian advocates are to be believed, it is the sole\nresponsibility of the Israelis to ensure\nthe well-being of those living in Gaza.\nTheir suffering is Israel\u2019s failing.\nBut why? Gaza does not only share a\nborder with Israel; it shares one almost\na fifth as long with Egypt: another Arabic-speaking, Muslim region. Surely,\nthen, the assistance across that border\nmust exceed anything received from\nIsrael? Surely the welcome received at\nthe Egyptian border is one of sympathy\nand even brotherhood?\nOne need only look at the way in which\nethnic Palestinians have been treated\nin Egypt, Jordan and Lebanon to get an\nunderstanding of how the Arab world\nregards the people of Palestine. It is all\ntoo easily forgotten that areas of Gaza\nwere under Egyptian control for nearly\n19 years, during which time the Palestinians were subjected to brutal oppression\nand appalling conditions in the refugee\ncamps were allowed to perpetuate. If\nonly the flow of genuine assistance were\nas bountiful as the flow of anti-Israeli\nrhetoric. At least, then, people would not\nbe dying for the sake of hypocrisy.\nThe systematic abuse of the Palestinians by their leadership and the rest\nof the Arab world has to end, and this\ncan only be achieved by removing the\njoker from the pack. The instinctive,\nritualised demonisation of Israel must\ncease, or else the motivation to provide\naid to the suffering will drop, and the\nmanipulation of the weak will continue.\n\u201cOne must try\nto look beyond\nemotions and\nbeyond the\nfeelings of sorrow\u201d\nA\nnyone who has lived in\nthe new Eastside/Southside complex of halls\nin Princes Gardens (of\nwhich I am one!) would\nknow that every kitchen comes with a\nflat screen plasma TV. To achieve su-periority, this fact would be bragged\nabout countless times in conversations\nwith friends of other universities or\neven with the older years at Imperial.\nI think having a plasma TV is a lot\nless impressive than it sounds. Many,\nif not most of my fellow friends sharing the same kitchen as me would\nhumorously mention that the envious\nTV would only ever show a mixture of\nFriends, Scrubs, The Simpsons or Top\nGear repeats on either E4, Channel 4\nor Dave (or E4+1, Channel 4+1, Dave\nja vu). Occasionally BBC Breakfast,\nas its name suggests, is shown in the\nmornings, serving more as a waking\nup mechanism than anything else. Although this circadian pattern has been\ndisrupted by the Australian Open in\nthe past week or so, I am certain that\nonce Roger Federer has won that, all\nwill return to normal again.\nEven though I am massive fans of\nall 4 programmes, I find this peculiarity very depressing. I would have\nthought British television could conjure up some form of mass entertainment appealing to the lazy, procras-tination-prone university students of\ntoday. I was wrong. Briefly scanning\nthe \u201cFavourite TV Programmes\u201d of my\nFacebook friends, I noticed a distinct\npattern: people either liked the American programmes of the present or the\nBritish comedies of the past, myself\nincluded.\nHaving also had a look ahead to\nwhat will be on the main TV channels\n(BBC1/2, ITV, C4/5) in the following\nweek, things didn\u2019t look any better.\nBeing an Imperial student I will bring\nsome mathematics into this. If primetime is defined as the period between\n7pm and 11pm, it would give 28 hours\nof supposedly worthwhile TV to watch.\nExcluding films, I have managed to\nfind 5 hours of quality TV I would\nwatch, most of it being comedy and including an hour of the aforementioned\nTop Gear. This is a poor reflection of\nBritish TV and it is hardly a surprise.\nWith Saturday prime time dominated\nby so called \u201cTalent\u201d shows, it is no\nwonder the quality of TV drama has\ndeteriorated so badly over the last dec-ade, catalysed by the conception of Big\nBrother whose life will shortly end and\nwill serve as a massive relief for many\npeople who literally \u201ccouldn\u2019t care less\u201d.\nSoaps, which in their wonder years\ncould pull in more than a third of the\npopulation of Britain are increasingly\ndiluted by eye-candy and improbable reincarnations of old characters.\nThe only genre worth watching has\nbeen the comedy programs, and even\nthough I still find the classics such\nas Blackadder better, the comedies\nof today are still compelling enough\nto watch. I do often wonder, with the\nmoney from the licence payers, why\nBritain cannot produce good quality\nTV. Maybe it is true that Jonathan Ross\nhas pocketed all of it!\nIt may seem unfair to compare the\nBritish television industry to the military might of Hollywood who seems\nto effortlessly churn out the law, crime\nand medical dramas that we know so\nwell. It may be down to the fact that the\nAmerican TV season is normally 24\nepisodes long where as our TV season\nis only 8-10 episodes long.\nExtending the TV season could mean\nthat good programs such as Spooks or\nHustle can last longer and attract more\nof an audience but there is still a lack\nof quality programmes. I had hoped,\nwhen I was about 12, that when I get\nto university I would finally be able to\nescape the parents shouting for me to\ntear myself away from the TV and get\nto bed. Well the day has come and how\nfrustrating is it that there is no good\nTV to watch in defiance! I hope, with\nthe economy now out of recession, that\nthe BBC can actually use some money\nto make some good programmes so\nthat students can use the plasma TV\nto good effect rather than relying on\na laptop screen. But for now, I really\ncouldn\u2019t care less: my 7-season West\nWing Box Set arrived in the post today!\n\u201cI have managed\nto find 5 hours of\nquality TV I would\nwatch, most of it\nbeing comedy \u201d\nKenWu onhowrubbishTVisthesedays...\n\n"

Best fancy dress definitely goes to our very own Imperial\nRAGgers Izzy and Jon who dressed up\nas pandas!\nThe day started off early for Loughborough and Cambridge, who began\ncollecting at 7am in order to catch the\nmorning commuters. It was, however,\nwell worth it! At around midday,\nImperial, LSE and one lonely UCL\ncollector joined in on the fun. Although UCL was meant to provide 20-30 collectors, they once\nagain proved that they are all a\nwaste of oxygen.

    "content": "5\nfelix FRIDAY 29 JANUARY 2010\nNEWS\nnews.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nThe Union\u2019s policy is to oppose a rise in tuition\nfees. When you\u2019re representing the Union\nexternally what do you say when someone asks\n\u2018howarewegoingfundeducationwithoutraising\ntuition fees?\u2019\nThat\u2019s never come up actually! So far, no one has\nactuallycomeupwithanalternativemodel.Ifyou\nlook at the NUS model, that involves graduate\ntax, which we\u2019re opposed to, because our policy\nalso opposes it. My problem with this question is\nthat I can only say what the Union\u2019s policy is and\nwe don\u2019t have a policy on this. We\u2019re working\nquitecloselywiththeothernon-NUSuniversities\nto bring about an alternative model for funding.\nThere\u2019s going to be a survey of students this\nterm which will help form a policy on this so\nhopefully next time I\u2019m asked that question I\ncan say our policy has an alternative model.\nTuition Fees\nAccommodation\nAre you worried that the price of accommodation\nat Imperial excludes students?\nMy main worry with accommodation prices is\nthat you end up with a sort of class system with\nhalls.You\u2019vegotthereallyrichpeopleinpremium\nrooms and less well off people in triple sharing\nrooms in crappy halls. There is an idea with\nsome people at college that Imperial shouldn\u2019t\ndo anything second-rate, so all accommodation\nshould be of a very high standard. Which is\ngreat, if they\u2019re affordable, which they won\u2019t be.\nMy argument is that to ensure that everybody\ncan afford to be at university, then you have to\nprovide a range, which includes lower quality,\naffordable, accommodation. There won\u2019t be any\nmore re-development for quite some time after\nEastside and Southside so for now we can keep\nthebalancethatwehaveatpresent.Imean,when\npeople can afford to pay \u00a337,000 a year in fees\nthen you might say that you can afford an extra\n\u00a3150 a week for accommodation, but if you\u2019re\npaying those fees and over-stretching yourself\nthenyouneedcheapaffordableaccommodation.\nthat happened?\nA - The problem with table service is\nthat people move around and then the\nbar-staff waste loads of time looking\nfor them, and then your food gets cold.\nOn busy nights we can\u2019t spare the staff\nto do table service. We\u2019re discussing,\nwith the re-development, to introduce\nhand held buzzers which will tell you\nwhen you can collect your food.\nK - Why isn\u2019t it coming in this year?\nA - I didn\u2019t expect the refurbishment\nto happen this year, we were told that\nwe wouldn\u2019t get any money from the\nCollege, but we put together a good\nbusiness plan and reduced the scope\nof what we\u2019re doing to the point where\nwe can afford it. So now it makes more\nsense for a lot of the stuff that I wanted\nto do this year to be included with the\nrefurbishment.\nK - Another thing that you promised\nin your manifesto was to have \u201csecret\nshoppers\u201d to report on the quality of\nservice in the Union. Is that happening?\nA - It\u2019s starting this term. I haven\u2019t selected the secret shoppers yet. Basically\nyou\u2019d go to the Union, get a meal, fill\nin a form about it and we\u2019d refund you\nso you get a free meal. Anyone who\u2019s\ninterested, give me an email. We actually did it over the summer, with the\nbarbecue that we had outside and we\nidentified some problems which were\nfixed. I wanted to start it straight away\nat the beginning of term but I found\nthat there was no need because even\nas President at times I was getting poor\nservice. We\u2019ve got to the point where I\nthink the service standards have come\nup, so now maybe I\u2019m too close to it and\nso hopefully the secret shoppers will\nhelp to iron out any problems that I\u2019m\nunaware of.\nBar service\nK - In terms of motivating student staff,\nwhat can you actually do to, say, speed\nup bar service?\nA - What I want to do is hold on to experienced bar staff, which you can only\ndo by offering them money. We\u2019re trying to put in a training program. What\nthe Union does quite badly is that we\nthrow people in at the deep end and\nthen people complain that they can\u2019t\npour a pint properly, well what can we\nexpect when we don\u2019t train them prop-erly. That said, we do have some excellent bar-staff who could be part of that\ntraining process.\nK - When is that going to come into\naction?\nA - We\u2019re trying to get an intern from\nCollege because we don\u2019t have the staff\nresources to do it ourselves. If that hap-pens, then we\u2019ll have someone starting\nin March to build this training package\nfor about six months. There is training\nat the bars already, which needs refinement also. The problem is that we\ndidn\u2019t do this in October so we didn\u2019t\ntrain all the new staff as we would have\nliked. So it\u2019s behind where it should be.\nWe also want to review pay-scales so\nthat student staff that progress through\nthe training and stay on longer will see\nan increase in their wages.\nK - At the moment, the bar-staff get\npaid near enough minimum wage. Do\nyou think that acts as a disincentive to\nreally care about the job?\nA - Yes. But it\u2019s not as simple as that,\nbecause we have to structure it to be\nfair. It\u2019s great to give people extra pay\nif they\u2019re experienced, but how do you\ndefine if they\u2019re experienced? There\u2019s\nthe basic pay when you first start and\nthat wouldn\u2019t go up because there\u2019s\nquite a high turnover, and you don\u2019t\nwant to invest resources if staff aren\u2019t\ngoing to stick around. Hopefully this\nwill start coming in around March.\nK - The price of drinks usually increases every couple of years, is this going to\nhappen next year?\nA - It will go up this summer, probably\nby about 10p. We managed to avoid\nputting the prices up last summer because we had a deal with a new sup-plier, but as result of that it has to go\nup this summer. Obviously there\u2019s another issue with the wider crackdown\non cheap drinks. If the government\ndecides to introduce minimum drinks\npricing then our prices could go up, but\nthen prices could go up everywhere.\nK - In your manifesto you promised\nto do more deals on spirits. But that\nhasn\u2019t happened.\nA - Nope. We did some deals at the\nbeginning of the year, but part of the\nproblem is that alcohol license holders\nare being told, in no uncertain terms,\nnot to encourage excessive drinking.\nIf we introduce, for example \u201cdouble\nup for 10p\u201d, as a new promotion, then\nthere\u2019d be issues with the licensing\npeople. I would like to see some deals\non spirits, but squaring it with licensing authorities is a problem.\nDrinks prices\nK - Do you think that students should\ncare about what goes on at the Union?\nA - It depends on what\u2019s going on. For\nexample, there\u2019s a motion coming to\nCouncil this month asking for a referendum on a smoke-free campus. Now\nif students think that\u2019s a good idea, or\na bad idea, then they should come and\nhave their views heard. If people want\nthings changed, then they should come\nto Council.\nK - Will a smoking ban have a positive\nimpact at imperial?\nA - It will definitely cause problems in\nsome areas. For example, if you\u2019re in\nthe bar, you\u2019ll have to go all the way out\nto Prince Consort Road, which is quite\ninconvenient.\nK - Do you agree with the principle of\na smoking ban?\nA - Students are adults and if they\nwant to smoke, that\u2019s their choice. I\u2019d\nbe in favour of more rigorous controls\nto stop people smoking by doors, but\nnot a complete ban. Of course, policing\nthat sort of thing is a right pain.\nSmoking ban\nK - The RCSU and CGCU Autumn\nBalls attracted a lot of controversy last\nterm. Did they spend too much money\non their events?\nA - They lost money, so you\u2019d say yes\nthey spent too much money, but it\u2019s\nnot as black and white as that. The FUs\nhave two main roles. One is welfare for\ntheir students, which is the most important thing that they should be doing and they should be spending time\non that. If you get people involved and\ncomfortable about talking to the FU by\nthrowing parties, then great. The other role is to foster a community spirit\nwith the FU, which is the reason for the\nparties, but I\u2019m not sure that you want\nto be spending extortionate amounts\nof money on that sort of stuff.\nK - The CGCU President last term,\nKirsty Patterson, responded to criticism\nabout the amount of money spent on\nthe CGCU\u2019s Masquerade Ball by referencing Rudyard Kipling\u2019s poem \u2018If\u2019. Do\nyou think that was an appropriate way\nto explain to engineering students why\nmoney was spent in the way that it was?\nA - No, basically. I\u2019m fairly laid back\nand if people think that I\u2019ve screwed\nsomething up, I should talk to them and\nexplain why things have or haven\u2019t been\ndone, which is why I\u2019m doing this inter-view. I think that you have to do that because people have voted for you.\nK - Also, the CGCU\u2019s Welfare Officer,\nAlice Rowlands criticised the amount\nof support that you provided to the\nCGCU in an article in felix. Do you feel\nthat her criticism was fair?\nA - The problem with the CGCU was\nthat nothing was written down. I told\nthem that we\u2019ll support it and we\u2019ll\nfind an act for it. The Union Entertainment team offered them a number of\nacts that they could choose and they\nwent for an expensive one. That\u2019s their\nchoice. Our role was not, and was\nnever going to be, to run their event\nfor them and give them the profit. The\nsituation was that we\u2019d support them\nin their event and on the Friday before\nI was with the President of Guilds getting things prepared for the Ball. The\nsupport was there, they just had to ask\nfor it, not just sitting there and whinge-ing. They should have come and said\n\u2018this is going wrong, what can you do?\u2019\nK - Regarding the Freshers Festival,\nDan Fowler, the organiser said they\ndidn\u2019t get enough Union support either.\nA - That was our fault like I talked\nabout before, and they did get less support than Guilds did. But we learned\na lot from that and I wouldn\u2019t say the\nGuilds didn\u2019t receive enough sup-port. When I asked them to really lay\nout what they expected from us, and\nwhat we didn\u2019t give them, they didn\u2019t\nrespond. I can\u2019t do anything about that\nif they\u2019re not going to tell me what they\nexpected.\nK - What is your main aim for the rest\nof your time as President?\nA - Getting the re-development done\nproperly. Even if I do nothing else, I\nwant to make sure that we get that\nFaculty crisis\nright, because we don\u2019t get the opportunity to spend that kind of money very\noften.\nK - The elections for next years sabbatical will be starting soon. What do you\nthink next year\u2019s President should be\nfocused on?\nA - There are probably two things, firstly pushing Phase 3 of the re-develop-ment through smoothly. But also making students aware of the representation\nnetwork and the changes that have been\nput in place. Students fill out surveys\nand then wonder what\u2019s been done but\nfor example, we have a new Dean of\nTeaching and Learning to deal with student\u2019s issues. The university created a\nwhole new position specifically for that\nand the challenge I think is to ensure\nthat students know about and are able\nto take advantage of these changes.\nThe\nsmoking\nban referendum will\nbe debated\nat Council\non the 15th\nof February in the\nUnion Dining Hall at\n6:30pm\n\u201cIt takes a\nlong time to get\ninto the role. If\nI could go back\nto September\nknowing what\nI know now,\nthen I would\nget a lot more\ndone. There\u2019s\na lot of stuff\nthat you don\u2019t\nnecessarily\nimagine as\ntaking up a lot\nof your time\nbut you get into\nthe job and you\nask yourself\n\u201cWhere\u2019s all my\ntime gone?\u201d\n\u201d\nIf you have\nany comments\nor queries\nregarding\nthe issues\ndiscussed in\nthe interview,\nAshley is\nhappy to hear\nthem. Email\npresident@\nimperial.ac.uk\nR.C.\n\n"

    "content": "imperialcollegeunion.org/oneworldweek\none world\nWhat if an object had a gender? After all,\n\u2018male\u2019 and \u2018female\u2019 electrical components\nare commonplace. Say we\u2019re in a lab. If we\u2019re\ngoing purely on appearance, then a pipette\nwould be, for obvious reasons, male, and\na test tube would be female. Similarly, a\nlaser could be masculine, whilst a telescope\ncould be considered to be more feminine.\nBut is this right? Have I made assumptions\nabout the gender of the equipment based on\nstereotypical gender-defined roles? Would\nthe objects wish to be primarily viewed as\nmale or female, or would they rather be\nconsidered first and foremost just as people?\nThis is the focus of a documentary created\nfor Gender Equality Day, part of One World\nWeek, by Women in Science, Engineering and\nTechnology, a group run by female students\nfor female students at Imperial. In the semi-comic documentary, WSET use the idea of\ngender possessing lab equipment to tackle\nthe issue of sexism in the lab, an ever present\nissue given that the laboratory is a traditionally\nmale dominated workplace. Billed as being\n\u2018light-hearted yet thought provoking\u2019, it aims\nto challenge preconceptions about the roles\nof male and female scientists in the lab, and\nquestions whether the lab is currently truly a\ngender neutral environment in which to work.\nWomen in Science, Engineering and\nTechnology is an Imperial College Union\nsociety dedicated to supporting the growth\nand development of female students at\nImperial. Created in 2007 by Eirini Spentza,\nEllin Saunders and Milena Peric, three Imperial\ngraduate students, its aim is to encourage\nfemale students from secondary school to\ngraduate level to pursue careers in science,\nengineering and technology.\nThe activities of the group are multifaceted,\nand include teaching, challenging\npreconceived gender-based notions about\nscientists and engineers, and inspiring by\nproviding identifiable, successful female role\nmodels in the scientific field. Regular events\ninclude networking events with leading female\nscientists as guest speakers, workshops\ntailored for female scientists focusing on\ndeveloping Curriculum Vitae, application and\ninterview skills, and open days for schools.\nOne WSET created initiative, \u2018Robogals\u2019, is\nspecifically designed to encourage female\nschool students to pursue a degree in science.\nFemale Imperial students, trained in using\nLEGO robot technology, go into schools and\nteach the female students to use the robotics.\nAs well as fostering a sense of scientific\nachievement, the workshops encourage\nfemale students to view a scientific career as\nbeing both attainable and interesting.\nAnother project, entitled \u2018100 Women, 100\nVisions, saw British Professional Photographer\nof the Year Jackie King taking portrait photos\nof 100 female students and staff members\nto produce a series which celebrates the\ndiversity and talent of female scientists at\nImperial. An exhibition of these portraits will\nbe held in London City Hall in March and\nFebruary, and an online exhibition of the\nphotos is available at imperialcollegeunion.\norg/100women100visions. This year, as part\nof International Women\u2019s Day on the 8th\nof March, WSET are encouraging Imperial\nstudents and staff to get behind the lens to\ntake pictures representing women at Imperial,\nas part of a photographic competition and\nexhibition run in collaboration with PhotoSoc.\nThe documentary produced by WSET for\nGender Equality Day will be shown on the\nday (1st Feb) on televisions around campus\nand projected onto the Queen\u2019s Tower.

Only this time it wasn\u2019t\nabout bombings, shootings or kidnappings,\nbut the extra-marital affair of NI\u2019s own First\nLady, Iris Robinson. Good old normal politics,\nit seemed, had finally returned to Northern\nIreland. But while an affair between a 59\nyear old and a teenager could have happened\nanywhere, the response to the affair was\nuniquely Northern Irish. In nowhere else\ncould so isolated an incident ever have\ntriggered threats of increasing sectarian\ntension. And yet this is exactly what is at\nstake in a frighteningly fragile peace process;\nthe slightest hiccup could bring the whole\nhouse of cards crashing down, leaving in\nits wake the threat of restarting the longest\ncivil war in world history which claimed over\n3,500 lives during the last 40 years and has\nleft many living in segregation, still viewing\n\u2018the other side\u2019 through a prism of suspicion\nand fear. The causes of the Northern Ireland\n\u2018Troubles\u2019 are many and complex but in\na province divided between Catholic and\nProtestant, religious intolerance is clearly a\nlarge culprit.\nIreland has had a painful history of religious\nintolerance dating back to the infamous\nPenal Laws, banning or attacking anything\nCatholic in predominantly Catholic Ireland,\nthe denial of soup to those who would not\nconvert to Protestantism during the Famine\nwhich was to claim a million lives and\nvicious retaliations leading to the slaughter\nof innocent Protestants. And yet there is\nnothing, nothing whatsoever in the teachings\nof either Christian denomination that justifies\nthis; nothing that should have lead to such\nviolence. Rather, it has been ignorance and\npolitical opportunism that has caused so\nmany of these tragedies; and continues to\nthreaten them today. Religious difference\nneed never to turn into religious intolerance,\nbut does so when groups misrepresent\ndiffering opinions while alluding to political\nand social prejudice. I remember a ten year\nold Catholic boy telling me that of course\nhe knew Protestant beliefs, \u201cDon\u2019t they\nbelieve in God the dog and God the cow\nand all that?\u201d Reverend Ian Paisley himself\ndenounced the Pope as the antichrist to his\nface. It is when religion ceases to be about\nGod and simply turns tribal that religious\nintolerance thrives. Catholicism means being\na Republican and Protestantism means\nwanting British rule; these are hijackings\nof religion. There was never a petrol bomb\nthrown in the name of the Sacrament of\nConfession or a bomb in defiance of papal\nauthority; rather it was people abusing\nreligion for their own ends.\nThis is not just an Irish problem; it is\nevidenced in Britain as well. Increasingly,\nbeing a Muslim can be seen to mean simply\nbeing against \u2018American Imperialism\u2019;\na thought that is no doubt insulting to\ntrue believers in Islam and yet Islam\nwas so clearly abused in the case of the\nfailed December bomber Umar Farouk\nAbdulmutallab, who had been president of\nthe UCL Islamic Society. It is against such\npeople that all religions must unite. We\ncannot deny the immense and powerful\nbeliefs held in common between our faiths.\nWe cannot allow prejudice to cloud our view\nof other religions. And yet it is people such\nas Abdulmutallab who claim centre stage,\nwhose voices are shouted from the mountain\ntops- just as with Northern Ireland it has\noften been the extremists whose bombs\nspoke louder than the prayers of others. As\nthe great Irishman W B Yeats said, \u201cThe best\nlack all conviction, while the worst are full of\npassionate intensity\u201d.\nBut the \u2018best\u2019 are out there; challenging\nreligious intolerance and promoting\ninterreligious understanding. That\u2019s why\nReligion\nby Charlotte Ivison\nimperialcollegeunion.org/oneworldweek\nmore articles and information at\nby Rory Fenton & Obadah Ghannam\nd\n\n"

As it turns out, annoyingly\nenough for a sports editor, predictions\naren\u2019t my strong suit. Not giving much\ncredence to Andy Murray\u2019s Australian\nOpen bid last week turns out to have\nbeen a mistake. It seems now that the\nonly player capable of halting Murray\u2019s\nscorching progress through the tournament (up to the quarters, the Brit\nhad yet to drop a set) is the king of tennis himself, Roger Federer.\nThe equally superlative Swiss has so\nfar played some very impressive tennis;\nit seems that the rough patch occurring\ntowards the end of last year was simply\nRoger getting used to a slightly different style of play. By adapting a more\nupcourt position and striking the ball\nearlier, Federer reduces his footwork\nand gets across the court quicker. According to the experts this induces less\nfatigue, and means that Fed can look\nforward to many more years of high-level competiton. Which can only be\ngood news for us spectators. More\nspectacular games, more bitter rivalries and more broken records await.\nSpeaking of rivals, one thing has\ncome to attention about this year\u2019s\nAussie open. I\u2019m talking about the\ndemise of Nadal, who despite playing\nsome very good tennis up to, and dur-ing, the Murray quarter-final was let\ndown by his knees midway through\nthe third set. The Spaniard has been\nbothered by injury for some time now,\nand I sincerely hope that this isn\u2019t the\nbeginning of the end for him. Sure, he\u2019s\nalready won six Grand Slams at the age\nof twenty-three. But for such a bright\nstar to burn out so soon would be a\nloss to the world of sport.\nReturning to Federer, if he does win\nthis one he\u2019ll equal Andre Agassi\u2019s\nrecord of 4 wins down under in the\nOpen era. But (and somehow I know\nthat I\u2019m going to get it wrong again) I\u2019ll\nbe rooting for Muray to be the first Brit\nto win an Open since 1936. C\u2018mon,\nAndy.\nAll right, that\u2019s all I\u2019m going to say\nabout tennis for a while, I promise. The\nproblem is that if I stop talking about\ntennis I\u2019m going to have to start talking\nabout football, which is a subject that\ntends to somewhat polarize a sporting\naudience.\nI\u2019m assuming you\u2019re a sporting au-dience, of course, because let\u2019s face\nit: the people who read this aren\u2019t the\nones who spend all their free time staring at a screen. You are a geek, in your\nown particular way-don\u2019t deny it, you\nwouldn\u2019t be here otherwise - but you\nbalance that geek with just the right\namount of jock (or in the case of Rugby,\nperhaps a bit too much jock). Thank\ngod this place actually has people who\nsee the point of running after a football\nor a Frisbee every week while freezing\nyour arse off or drowning in mud. That\nsaid, the only way Imperial will actually top the BUCS university league\ntable is if they recognize MMORPGs\nas a sport.\nIn any case, thanks for turning your\nfelix around every week, and even\nlooking inside the back cover from\ntime to time. If you have any sugges-tions, or requests as to what you\u2019d like\nto see in the sports section, email us\nat sport.felix@imperial.ac.uk. (Ed -Please send in you reports. We would\nlove to hear from you! Though, when\nreferring to people can you refrain\nfrom using nicknames. Though\nthey\u2019re fun and mildly banterous at\nbest, anyone reading it years later\nwill not have a clue who these individuals are. Thanks!)\nAn editorial\nof sorts. Or\nsomething\nthe match was fitness, since this was\nthe first time many had exercised in a\nmonth!\nWhen the opposition arrived having\ntaken the scenic route via Heathrow,\nthe match eventually started.\nImperial dominated from the start\ntaking an early lead and were 3-0 up at\nhalf time thanks to goals from Soraya,\nEllie and Carina.\nOur Christmas lack-of-practise unfortunately began to show in the second half with many tired legs.\nDespite the fatigue, we still managed\nto score one more goal without con-Hockey 1sts &\n2nds in New\nYears\u2019 success\nContinued from back page\nContinued from back page\nceding, and the game eventually finished 4-0 to Imperial.\nThe victory means we move on to\nthe semi-finals of the reserve cup, to\nplay either the Royal Veterinary College or Royal Holloway.\nCredit has to go to King\u2019s medics\nwho only had nine players but still\nmanaged to make Imperial\u2019s lives difficult at times.\nThe women\u2019s 2s were back in action\non the Wednesday playing Buckinghamshire at home.\nAgain, they were strong from the beginning with solid defending allowing\nthe midfield and forwards to push up\nand put pressure on the Buckinghamshire New University\u2019s defence.\nSome great hockey and well-re-hearsed set pieces kept Imperial in the\nopposition\u2019s half for the majority of the\ngame, smothering the Bucks team.\nFantastic goals from Soraya, Ellie,\nAmanda, Annabel and Hilary brought\nthe ladies another well deserved win\nwith an 8-0 rout being the final score.\nIC ladies\u2019 hockey 2nds. Of course they\u2019re smiling, they just won 8-0. You\u2019d be smiling too\n\n"

Wait a\nminute, iPad, you having a laugh?\nYou sure it doesn\u2019t come with \u2018flexy\nwings\u2019 and should be kept in a woman\u2019s\nhandbag? OK.\nYep, the Apple iPad, not the iSlate or\niTablet, but iPad. To be honest I\u2019m not\nquite sure why Apple didn\u2019t call it the\niPod touch HD or iPod Maxi, because\nthat\u2019s essentially what it is. A giant iPod\ntouch. I have to admit, I\u2019m a little dis-appointed. I would have liked something more like an OSX touch tablet,\nnot some iPhone OS running maxi\niPod touch.\nAnyway, the proof will be in the playing with it, as to whether it\u2019s any good\nor not. Apple\u2019s trying to slide this one\nin a space in between the laptop and\nthe smartphone. I\u2019m not entirely sure\nthere\u2019s actually a market position in\nthere for the iPad to fill. It\u2019s not as capable or cheap as a decent netbook\nand it\u2019s not as portable as an iPhone or\nNexus One.\nThe iPad\u2019s also got a dock connector\nand it\u2019ll take accessories like an iPhone\nor iPod touch like the dock keyboard.\nGreat a portable keyboard for the iPad,\nI\u2019ve been after one for the iPhone for\nages. Nope, Apple\u2019s dock keyboard is\na full size keyboard that sits on your\ndesk. Yes that\u2019s right next to my computer with it\u2019s own full size keyboard.\nWho\u2019s stupid idea was that? I mean\nsurely if it\u2019s full size and sits on your\ndesk why the hell wouldn\u2019t you just use\nyour computer? Novelty value? Now,\nif they made a docking a collapsible or\nmini physical keyboard now that might\nmake sense, but no sign of anything\nthat useful.\nIt may look pretty and it\u2019s apparently\na pretty slick experience, but where\u2019s\nthe need for it? Perhaps you could get\nit and buy a dumb-phone, forgo the\nSamuelGibbs\nSamuelGibbs Technology Editor\nC\nhina and Google have begun\nsquaring off in what is bound\nto be a protracted political and\nlegal battle that might take years to set-tle. Yet whatever the outcome, the fu-rore over China\u2019s attempts to infiltrate\nGoogle has kicked up an issue which\nhas been brewing for many years now\n\u2013 the effects of internet censorship. I\nspent the majority of my childhood in\nSaudi Arabia, where the state of the\ninternet is markedly different from\nthe rest of the world. Not only are the\nstandard \u2018morally corrupting\u2019 websites\nblocked, but so are most websites that\nwe take for granted here in the UK,\nsuch as Facebook and Myspace - the\nlatter remained blocked when I last left\nthe country in 2007.\nAs we enter a decade where perpetual internet connectivity isn\u2019t as much\na luxury but a necessity and access to\nthe internet is being legally defined as a\nhuman right in a handful of countries,\nthe extent of global internet censorship\nis rather surprising. Most governments\nmaintain some form of filtering; even in\nthe UK all ISPs are required to monitor\ntraffic for suspected child pornogra-phy. Yet a handful of governments take\nthis much further, blocking access to a\nwide variety of websites, justifying the\ncensorship as vital to their national or\nreligious interests. The culprits tend to\nbe monarchies, pseudo-democracies\nand the handful of communist nations\nthat still remain - countries that have a\nlot to lose by allowing citizens free access to view and transfer information.\nOf course maintaining censorship\nincurs quite a hefty economic cost as\nwell as deterring otherwise profitable\nforeign investment projects. To put\nthe task of internet censorship into\nperspective, one need only consider\nthe fact that China has 300 million internet users, about the same number\nas the entire population of the US. To\nhandle filtering of that kind of traffic,\nChina spent five years designing the\nmajestically named \u2018Golden Shield\nProject\u2019. Mere preliminary work on\nthe system cost roughly a billion dol-lars. Saudi Arabia has taken a different\napproach to the problem, routing all\ntraffic through a server farm at a uni-versity, where all requests are filtered\nwith those relating to blacklisted URLs\nimmediately blocked. This filtering\nis of course a major limitation on the\nnational internet infrastructure. Saudi\ninternet providers are among the few\nto still offer dialup connections, with\ntheir fastest DSL connections maxing\nout at 10 Mbps, costing a whopping 42\npounds per month excluding installation (makes BT in the UK look positively cheap).\nThe political nuances involved in\nreducing internet censorship doesn\u2019t\nhelp things either. While the US was\nquick to denounce the Chinese attempts to infiltrate Google, with Hilary\nClinton warning of an \u2018information\ncurtain\u2019 that is descending across the\nworld, it\u2019s surprising that an American\ncompany maintains the blacklist that\nallows Saudi Arabia to block all websites \u201crelated to drugs, bombs, alcohol,\ngambling\u201d and most vaguely, \u201cpages insulting the Islamic religion or the Saudi\nlaws and regulations\u201d. The close military and political relations between the\nWest and Saudi Arabia also means that\nmany free speech related human rights\ntransgressions go virtually unnoticed.\nJust three years ago a prominent Saudi\nblogger, Fouad al-Farhan, was arrested\nand held without charge, seemingly\nto set an example to those who might\nquestion the government about policy.\nThe issue raised very little attention\ninternationally, with 5 months passing\nbefore he was released without charge\nand being told to \u201ctone down\u201d his commentary by the authorities.\nWhatever the result of Google\u2019s battle with China is and whatever Google\u2019s\nmotivations, it\u2019s obvious that there\u2019s\na deeper issue that\u2019s slowly coming to\nthe fore in many countries that practice\nwidespread censorship. The internet\nhas changed from a luxury to a neces-sity. Globally, individuals need easy access to a good connection, while businesses require the confidence that they\ncan move confidential information\nacross the globe in a secure and quick\nmanner. Without being able to provide\nthese assurances, these countries run\nthe risk of creating a data black hole,\nletting the pervasive computing bandwagon pass by without harnessing it\u2019s\npotential for growth and possibly creating a connected divide.\nsmartphone experience for the larger\n\u2018smart-tablet\u2019, but I don\u2019t know about\nyou, if it won\u2019t fit in my pocket it\u2019s not\nlikely to come with me.\nOf course there\u2019s also the bog-com-puting segment. That one place where\nyou sit but can\u2019t really have a laptop\non your legs. Bit pricy for me, perhaps\nSteve Ballmer might be interested.\nThere\u2019s also the often lucrative medical or educational sectors that the iPad\nmight be useful in. Of course, we fit\nsquarely in the educational sector so\ncan you see it in your work flow? Perhaps as a much more flexible and faster\neBook reader for text books? But then\nthere\u2019s no multi-tasking so no Spotify\nwhilst you scan through Molecular\nMicrobiology of the Cell.\nTalking about eBooks, Amazon\nshould be seriously worried at Apple\u2019s announcement of the iBooks\nstore. It was bound to happen with\nthe release of an Apple tablet device.\niBooks could do for the eBook market\nwhat the iTunes music store did for\nmusic downloads. They\u2019re supporting the ePub format which is nice and\nthey\u2019re making as many distribution\ndeals as possible. OK, so the iPad may\nnot be the best reader around as reading from backlit LCD is always much\nmore tiresome to the eyes than print\nor E-ink, but I think the eReader is a\ndieing breed. It\u2019s too limited and the\nrefresh-rate of the E-ink display is far\ntoo low to support any intuitive UI.\nIn fact I think if OLED screens ever\nget into a device like the iPad, reading\nfrom a tablet screen might just be good\nenough. I know I\u2019ve been dreaming of\nan eReader device that\u2019s good enough\nto read journal articles and be able to\nscrawl notes on them. It sure would\nsave paper and be a hell of a lot more\nportable than that stack of articles you\nneed for that literature review you\u2019ve\ngot to hand in tomorrow.\nInternet freedom, you take it for granted but should you?\nWeekly Wrap-up: A quick guide to the best of the rest you might have missed\nYou could be forgiven for\nthinking that this was an Apple\nonly week. But the blackhole of\nnon-Apple related news that is\nan \u2018Apple Event\u2019 let slip a few\ninteresting tidbits which I\u2019ve\nselected for your enjoyment.\nHave you ever thought that\nyour ordinary everyday RC car\nwas looking a bit 20th century?\nWondered what would happen if it was powered by sugar?\nYeah, me neither, but Tomy has\njust unveiled the Ene Pocket.\nThis hideous looking box of a\nRC car runs on the Sony Bio\nBattery which uses the energy\nreleased from sugar breakdown to generate electricity.\nOf course efficiency is entirely\ndependent on what kind of\nliquid you feed\nit. Coke is\ngood but\ngrape\njuice is\napparently the\nbest. All\nyou have\nto do to power this\nlittle eco-racer is top it up with\nsoda and watch it fly. Don\u2019t\nexpect it to break any speed\nrecords, but it\u2019s certainly an\ninnovative (if somewhat odd)\nuse of sugary drinks. No word\non when it\u2019ll hit retail but if it\ntakes off we could see a whole\nhost of sugar powered toys.\nMore weird tech hit the news\nthis week including a pair of\nshoes that can Tweet. Obviously the makes of the Rambler\nSneakers have a low opinion of\nthe inane chatter that occurs\non Twitter, creating a pair of\nshoes that tweets every time\nyou take a step. What\u2019s next?\nA toilet that tweets every time\nyou... Think I\u2019ll pass thanks.\nEver lost a small pet and\nthought, I wish I could carry\nmy essays and presentations in\n\u2018Hammy\u2019? OK, maybe not, but\nnow with the Taxidermy USB\nstick you can put your dead rodents and other small\npets to use as USB drives complete with red LEDs for eyes.\nJust remember to eject before\nunplugging OK?\nThis week saw the first real\ntime tweets from space, as the\nISS got hooked up to the \u2018net.\nEssentially astronauts on the\nISS can remotely access a computer on the ground from the\nstation. It\u2019s no broadband, but\nbetter than nothing I suppose.\nMore Google action this\nweek too, with the roll out of\na feature called \u2018Answer Highlighting\u2019. Essentially what this\ndoes is identify and extract\nstructured data and puts it\nright in your search results.\nExcellent if you want an answer quick, but it could be really damaging for content web-sites. Users won\u2019t need to leave\nGoogle to find the answers\nthey\u2019re looking for and so\nthey won\u2019t bother going to the\noriginal site. Rupert Murdock\nhas accused Google of \u2018stealing content\u2019 and this move by\nby the search giant certainly\nseems like it.\nExoskeletons have always\nbeen the dream of the SciFi sol-dier, to be encased in a metallic\nfighting suit, able to lift enormous weights and possibly\nmore importantly fire\nenormous guns. Soon,\nthe weight carrying\naspect might actually reach reality\nif Lockheed has\nanything to do\nabout it.

Yep it\u2019s January,\nits bloody freezing and this\nis your first arts section since\nChristmas.\nHow was your Christmas? Mine was\nalright, strangely my favourite present\nwas a pair of red ballet shoes from my\nparents. I don\u2019t do ballet but they will\nbe put to good use scrambling around\nthe floor pretending to be a hippy for\nour spring show Hair.\nI also finally got to update my blog\nover Christmas as exams tend to get\nme thinking about anything other than\nChemistry. Yes, I have a blog and yes\nit is about theatre (what else did you\nexpect?) Its mainly a chance for me\nto vent my anger over things like John\nBarrowman\u2019s sorry excuse for a Saturday evening show \u201cTonight\u2019s the Night\u201d\nand the plight of British Musical Theatre thanks to Andrew Lloyd Webber\nand co. I also tend to put reviews for\nshows I\u2019ve paid for on there which tend\nto be the more obscure choices. I love\nlooking on Google analytics to see who\nactually looks at my blog, although it\nis, of course mainly my friends.\nMy little sister has now decided she\nwants one too, this time about art and\ncraft, so I\u2019ve had her asking how to do\nthe coding for it. Finally a reason to be\na geek who can do html!\nSo if you like theatre, you\u2019re welcome\nto check the blog out at http://the-atregirlinascienceworld.blogspot.com\nand if you don\u2019t, you should still check\nout the arts section as you might find\nsomething you do like.\nThis week, Christopher has been immersing himself in Russian Literature\nand the life of Mikhail Blugakov and\nhis mate Stalin. This takes me back to\nA Level history, studying Stalin and\n\u201cconsolidating our notes\u201d (my teacher\u2019s\nfavourite phrase).\nRox Middleton takes us on a magical\njourney through the world of comedy\nsongs and shows us how they can be\nused to pass Chemistry exams (umm,\nbit late for me Rox) and I\u2019ve been out to\nsee Legally Blonde the musical. Finally.\nA new musical!\nComedy Comedy Comedy...Tonight!\nWell, comedy songs. Rox Middleton shares some of her favourite examples from Lehrer to Minchin.\nFrom Russia with Satire\nChristopher Self explores Russian Literature... and Stalin\nI\ns comedy art? There\u2019s a certain\nsnobbishness, I think, which\nsays no. There\u2019s a tendency to\nconsider comedy merely cheaply scoring laughs, compared to\nthe magnificent themes of True Art.\nBut is this so fair? Everybody likes to\nbe made to laugh; dramas are praised\nfor their ability to joke whilst heaving\ntowards their epic goal. Sculptural or\ngraphic jokes are common; the idea\nis that they make you laugh, but then\nmake you stand around to really think\nabout what the artist is really trying\nto do. Because heaven forbid the artist should be really trying to make you\ngiggle. Comedy has such physical and\nemotional power that it is absurd not to\nadmit that it has artistic merit. In fact,\nbrilliant jokes take such originality and\nskill that the best are surely some of the\nworld\u2019s most beautiful things.\nWell, some hyperbole perhaps, but\na particularly exquisite specimen of\ncomedy is a subject dear to me; the\ncomic song. Although nominally mu-sic, the tune can vary from catchy\nmelody to a repetitive riff for the lyr-ics. Ideal to sing or to listen to, perfect\nfor the musical and non-musical alike,\nthey are more than the tameness and\ncringey innuendoes of George Formby\u2019s Little Stick of Blackpool Rock (or\nis he just pleased to see you type\u2026) or\neven my Granny\u2019s favourite, Bernard\nCribbins, who said Right Said Fred.\nGood comic songs are a rare substance\nbecause their creators tread a fine line\nbetween edgy and obscene, whimsical\nand twee. So for this purpose, as so often is the case, Youtube is your friend\n(especially if you like your friends\nslightly fuzzy and with low quality\nslide-shows).\nI plan to make the following a pleasant potter through the genre of comedic song with absolutely no sense of\nobjectivity or rigour. So let\u2019s start with\nThe Best. I don\u2019t want to make this\nramble through comic songs to be all\nabout Tom Lehrer, so it won\u2019t be; but\nit\u2019ll be tough. Tom Lehrer is a mathematician whose songs you may have\nheard, what chemist worth their salt\ncould have missed The Elements Song,\nwhich lists every element of the periodic table (of the time) to a galloping\njingle? Most of his songs are still fresh\nas ever, although he left the public eye\nto return to mathematics and teaching\n- having written only 37 songs, in 1960.\nHis subjects range from STDs to soci-ology, bombs, scouts, plagiarism and\nmasochism besides much more. The\nlamer ones can\u2019t take much repetition,\nbut in general they are miles ahead of\nmost comic songs in originality and\nenergy, and are still setting the standard for the next generation.\nFor more musical whimsy there is\nalso Flanders and Swann, very much\nmore old-fashioned and wordy with\nsome slightly outdated topics. Although a few have not stood the test of\ntime, others are addictive, even catchy;\namusing songs are the Song of the Reluctant Cannibal (If the JuJu had meant\nus not to eat people, he wouldn\u2019t have\nmade us of meat), and the brilliant First\nand Second Law of Thermodynamics\n(Heat won\u2019t pass from the cooler to\nthe hotter, you can try it if you like but\nyou far better notter). Try Have Some\nMadeira M\u2019dear for the bizarre sound\nof two very quaint men singing abut\ndate-rape.\nFor something a little more mod-ern, you probably already know The\nFlight Of The Conchords, whose ingenious flashes, like the binary solo,\nor hip-hop-opotamus, make up for the\nsometimes rather tediously adolescent\nsentiments. For something more excit-ing, Weird Al\u2019 Yankovic is pretty good;\nI love Amish Paradise, a parody of\nGangsta\u2019s paradise but with an excellent video of an Amish town (Tonight\nwe\u2019re gonna party like it\u2019s 1699). Tim\nMinchin is a rising star with some really good material, like a song in which\nhe points out to his girlfriend that\nwhile he thinks she\u2019s special she obviously falls within a bell-curve. Mitch\nBenn is another comedian songwriter\nwith pleasantly weird imaginings, but\nsurpassing most others by singing\nabout topical news as well. There are\nalso Imperial graduates The Amateur\nTransplants, with very funny medically themed songs in their repertoire\nand their Black and White Menstrual\nShow. And these acts nestle amongst\ngazillions of funny musicians, ready to\nbe discovered or perhaps discarded.\nI haven\u2019t mentioned comedians like\nBill Bailey, Victor Borge or Kit and\nThe Widow, whose comedy is focused\nmore on the music itself than the lyr-ics, and are all definitely worth a watch.\nThen there are also so many comedians who have dipped into comic songs\nnow and then, notably Victoria Wood,\nHugh Laurie and also Monty Python,\nwhose Every Sperm Is Sacred, and The\nLumberjack Song are gems from their\nsmallish offering of humorous tunes.\nThis article is futile in attempting to\nconvey the brilliance of these comedians without their music, so I say go and\nget some culture down you today.\nA\nrtists are fascinating\ncreatures, the drive and\nnatural ability to create\nsomething in which others find genuine meaning\nis an incredible power. And one that\nseems to attract characters whose own\nlives are as noteworthy as any of their\ngreat works.\nThere\u2019s a Stalinist era Russian author\ncalled Mikhail Bulgakov who exemplifies this phenomenon, a young doctor\nwith a bourgeois intellectual background whose life became embroiled in\nthe turmoil of the Russian Revolution.\nUnable to escape the new soviet nation\nand having been forced into combat\nas a frontline medic in the civil war he\neventually found himself in communist Moscow writing reports and satire\nfor some of the leading publications.\nThe state was new, just finding its feet,\nand censorship was not the all powerful controller it would become. He\neventually began to write books suc-cessfully, publishing a few that, though\nwell received, began to earn him a\nreputation as a counter revolutionary,\nsomething particularly dangerous for\na person with his background. While\nwriting his fourth satirical work The\nHeart of a Dog, the censor cracked\ndown, confiscating the manuscript before he could publish it. He never got\nanother book published during his life\ntime, falling with his wife into a state\nof poverty. This unimaginable sense of\nentrapment eventually led him to write\nto Stalin himself begging to be allowed\nto leave the country.\nBulgakov\u2019s relationship with Stalin is truly surreal. Stalin was the first\nreader, the censor in chief, and at this\ntime was probably well acquainted\nwith Bulgakov\u2019s works. Following his\nletter the first citizen personally called\nthe author and Bulgakov talked frankly\nwith the autocrat about his personal\nand political problems, a conservation\nthat ended with Stalin arranging work\nfor him as a director. He publicly criticized Bulgakov\u2019s works but never denounced him as an enemy of the state;\nBulgakov was never threatened with\nthe gulags. Indeed when he penned a\nplay that depicted Stalin as a kind and\ngentle wartime leader in the civil war,\nthat too was banned as an executive\ndecree from the leader himself, who\ndeclared that Bulgakov was just trying\nto win him over. But satire is a subtle\nthing that is often done with a heavy\nhand; just because a book has a message\ndoesn\u2019t make it a good read, and this\nis one of the reasons I particularly love\nBulgakov\u2019s books. Written as they were\nunder the oppressive atmosphere of the\nSoviet Union, the satire in The Heart of\na Dog and The Master and Margarita is\nalways veiled. There is an added depth\nto a good story that genuinely leaves you\nsitting back thinking \u201cWell I bet that\ncharacter symbolises\u2026\u201d\n. More than just\na critique of Soviet life his books reflect\nhis own existence and are genuinely imbued with a fantastical sense of magical\nabsurdity.\nThe Master and Margarita in particular has become one of my favourite\nbooks, an incredible tale that Bulgakov\nnever finished re-writing that draws on\nall of his experiences and frustrations\nand is packed with satire so cleverly\ninterwoven into the story that it can\nbe read entirely in abstraction from\nit. It always seems odd to talk about\nhow well written one finds a translated\nforeign novel. But let me just say that\nthis is one of two foreign books I\u2019ve\nread that have actually made me want\nto learn the parent language, just to\nsee if the author\u2019s prose were really as\nbreathtakingly good as they appeared.\nMinchin, the new God of comedy song\nGrandad of cringe Cribbins, I just put\nhim in because I love Doctor Who.\nTHE ARTS\n\n"

Women are for\ngays.\u2019 That, my friends, is what the elite\nfirms of this world like to call \u2018blue-sky\nthinking\u2019- whatever the fuck that really\nmeans, I\u2019ll leave it to you. In one fell\nswoop I had to re-evaluate my whole\noutlook on life, it didn\u2019t take long as it\nturned out that Philpott was being a\nphenomenal twat.

Besides it\u2019s their own\nfault that they attract such obscure\nclientele- with Foster\u2019s (or what they\ncall Foster\u2019s) at \u00a31.87 a pint you\u2019re going to get some Class A retards kicking about. What do they want? A slap\nround the head? Yes, they do.\nI ramble\u2026 yes the bar. That place\nwas a shitting train wreck. I don\u2019t claim\nto still have a fully functional brain, in\nfact I know a good chunk of it is missing and I\u2019m partly unhinged. Nevertheless I have never, not even once, felt\nthat I need to wear a lycra wife beater\nto the bar. Literally never, essentially,\nif I was asked to define acceptable bar\nwear, lycra would not feature highly on\nmy list, if at all, not even if it weren\u2019t\nfucking snowing outside.

Now, if he\u2019d flopped his wang\nout and started to exemplify the finer\nart of the windmill, without question,\nI would have been very much less than\nimpressed.

    "content": "4 felix FRIDAY 29 JANUARY 2010\nnews.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nNEWS\nKadhim - Let\u2019s start by talking about\nthe third phase of the Beit Redevelopment. What\u2019s the vision?\nAshley - Our aim is to create an atmosphere where people feel like they\u2019ve got\na high quality product but not extortionate prices. We want to have a venue\nthat\u2019s for students but that\u2019s also really\ngood quality.\nK - You\u2019ve been asking for student input\ninto the redevelopment. How has that\nbeen?\nA - I\u2019ve found that people just doodle or draw jacuzzis on the plans; we\nhaven\u2019t had a lot of positive input. If\nstudents want to have input then they\nshould give proper ideas, otherwise\nwe\u2019ll do what we think is right, and if\nthat turns out to be wrong, well we\u2019ve\ngiven students a chance.\nK - Don\u2019t you think that if the union actively went out, face-to-face to get student input, it would work better?\nA - We did actually go around the JCR\nwith the plans for the redevelopment\nshowing them to students. We got some\ngood ideas but most people, like I said,\njust messed about. The feedback hasn\u2019t\nbeen as good as we\u2019d hoped but if students don\u2019t submit ideas then there\u2019s no\nway we can take it into account. We\u2019re\nstill working on the plans so there\u2019s still\na lot of space for student\u2019s ideas and\ncomments to be worked into it. We\nalso have a working group of around 10\nstudents which has provided good feedback so it hasn\u2019t all been bad.\nK - Do you think that the problems with\nsay, dBs, are a bit overblown?\nA - The bar service capacity, even with\nthe mobile bar, is terrible. With the re-development, the bar will be twice as\nbig so on busy nights there won\u2019t be a\nproblem with getting drinks. In terms\nof getting students into dBs, it\u2019s been\nmuch busier this year on Wednesdays\nand Fridays since we\u2019ve tweaked the\nmusic lineup. Once you\u2019ve got completely pissed, you just want cheesy\nmusic and to dance around. So we\u2019ve\ngiven them that and it\u2019s been a lot busier in dBs.\nK - A large part of the renovation of dBs\ninvolves turning it into a high quality\nlive music venue, but what\u2019s the point\nwhen like you say, it\u2019s drunken cheesy\nmusic that\u2019s pulling people in?\nA - One of the key things that came out\nof the Trading Survey 18 months ago\nwas that students wanted to see more\nlive music. And we also want students\nto be proud to come over here and\nsay \u201cWell, actually we\u2019ve got a really\ngood Union\u201d. Which means, on Sports\nNight, then we cater to the situation\nbut on say, a Friday, we can put on\nsome good live bands.\nK - Well this year a \u201cFreshers Festival\u201d\nwas held, with live acts. It wasn\u2019t a wild\nsuccess you might say. You\u2019re aiming\nto have more live music, but does that\nsit well with the failure of the \u201cFreshers\nFestival?\u201d\nA - The problem with the Freshers\nFestival was that it was a week after a\nheavy freshers week. We should have\nlumped it in with Fresher\u2019s Week, included it with the marketing for that\nand dropped the price, then it would\nhave worked a bit better. And there\u2019s a\ndifference between doing a live gig on\na Friday night and doing a whole weekend of music.\nK - One of your manifesto points has\nbeen to have more student input into\nthe planning of Union events. What\nhave you done so far to achieve that?\nA - At Southampton university, their\nexecutive committee (which is made\nup of students) receives the term planner in advance and can say we want\nthis to change or we want to tweak this.\nSo we\u2019re going to bring that method in.\nBut what I\u2019ve wanted to do, which is\nthe best way to ensure that students are\ngetting what they want, is to get clubs\nto hold events at the Union and support them doing that.\nK - How\u2019s that worked out?\nA - Not as well as I hoped if I\u2019m hon-est, mainly because I\u2019ve been running\naround doing so much other stuff.\nWhat I\u2019ve found is that I\u2019ve got less\nthan a day a week, if that, to work on\nmy manifesto points, and the rest of my\ntime is spent trying to stop the Union\ncrashing down around me.\nK - So you\u2019ve found that the demands of\nyour job day-to-day mean that it\u2019s quite\nhard to reach out to students?\nA - Yes, much more difficult than I\nimagined. During Freshers Week we\nconnected well with a lot of students.\nI must have spoken to hundreds of students that week. But then term starts\nand everything kicks off. You\u2019ve got to\nhelp individual students with problems\nand there are committees to go to; you\nfind that you\u2019re running around all the\ntime. After the initial burst in Fresher\u2019s\nweek it\u2019s been more difficult.\nLook out in\nnext week\u2019s\nfelix for\nthe chance\nto rename\ndBs and\ndaVinci\u2019s\nTHE STATE\nOF OUR\nUNION\nKADHIM SHUBBER INTERVIEWS\nUNION PRESIDENT ASHLEY BROWN\nON HIS ACHIEVEMENTS AND\nFAILINGS AS PRESIDENT SO FAR\nPromises kept?\nTable service in the\nevenings\nBetter induction\ntraining for bar-staff\nStudent input in\nevents planning\nSupport for club\nevents at the Union\nRemove entrance\nfee on Sports night\nBeit Redevelopment\nUnion food\nK - Let\u2019s talk about the changes in daVinci\u2019s. What\u2019s happening there?\nA - We\u2019re going to change the design\nof the kitchens because we don\u2019t need\nthem in their current state. The Tower\nRooms has damaged our lunchtime\ntrade. The idea is to have a grill kitchen\nlike the Prince Regent, which doesn\u2019t\ntake up a lot of space, but they can\nstill cook a lot. But we\u2019re still discussing what that lunchtime trade will be,\nand actually that would be quite a good\nthing for students to have input in. I\nthink we still need to keep some form\nof lunchtime food at the union, but it\u2019s\nwhether we stick with hot food or just\na sandwich bar.\nK - The catering is quite a financial\nburden on the Union right?\nA - Lunchtime catering was losing us\naround \u00a380,000 a year, we\u2019ve made\nsome changes which reduced this to\naround \u00a340,000 a year but it\u2019s getting\nbetter still. If we were making a profit,\nthen we\u2019d keep it in its present state but\nwith a new venue it\u2019s a good time to\nthink about what students want.\nK - Why do you think that students\nwould rather eat at say, the Library\nCafe, than the Union?\nA - I think it has something to do with\nthe location, and what we are capable\nof serving. The kitchens are so old and\nknackered we cannot produce something of the same quality as say, the\nTower Rooms. When I was a fresher\nthere would be a massive queue in dBs\nfor baguettes at lunchtime, but then\nthe JCR started offering baguettes and\npeople didn\u2019t come over anymore, so\nour location is a disadvantage.\nK - Let\u2019s talk about food in the evening.\nWhen you campaigned you wanted to\nre-introduce table service.

However the medics replied shortly after\nas a lack of communication led to a\ncharge down not far from the College line, leaving the medic 9 to run in\nunopposed.\nThe College players recomposed\nthemselves with the forwards leading\nthe charge and headed into half-time\nconfident that the medics were there\nfor the taking.\nThe start of the second half saw IC\u2019s\ndynamic game-plan finally come together with the medics being able to\noffer little in response. College took\ncontrol of the set-piece play as Niall\nWatson, Captain Coggy and Fresher\nToby bossed the scrum and Tom Chavas showed some typical Gallic flair\nin the line-out. Dave Blake\u2019s one man\nmission to take on the medic forwards single-handedly saw him justly\nrewarded with a hat-trick of tries as\nwell as providing numerous breaks\nsupported by Rob Dowden and Fraser\nJames, allowing College to stretch their\nopponents around the park.\nIn the last 20 minutes, College\nstepped up their offensive efforts and\nneat handling from Hugh Jarman and\nfresher Alex led to Chris Lau scoring\nin the corner. Not content with seeing their teammates lead the way, the\nforwards also went on the attack and\nColin Hill\u2019s try rounded off a powerful\ncontribution from the sub.\nFurther contributions from subs Jack\nGoring and freshers Rob, Tom and Oscar led to College completing a magnificent 42-5 victory.\nAn exhausted yet ecstatic 2nd XV\nheaded to the bar to reflect over a\nmemorable win with Hugh Dingleberry, recently dropped from the firsts,\nentertaining the victors with some\nclassic anti-medic banter.\nDavid Wilson Sports Editor\nThree medal\nhaul the British\ntarget for\nVancouver\nBritain isn\u2019t really into Winter sports.\nThe names Ed Drake, Elise Christie,\nDavid Murdoch do not have the same\neffect as those of Wayne Rooney, Lewis\nHamilton and Jonny Wilkinson. But\nthose three have, along with 40 other\nmen and women been chosen to represent Great Britain at the Winter Olympics held in Vancouver this year.\nBritain wouldn\u2019t be your first port\nof call if you were looking for world\nclass winter sports athletes, after all\nthe country grinds to a halt with a thin\nsmattering of snow and every year\nthere is the suggested Christmas break\nfor the football league. As a nation I\nthink it is fair to say we don\u2019t like the\ncold. We don\u2019t not have the geographical landscapes (really big mountains)\nneeded to produce the top athletes for\nwinter sports and thus the sports are\ndominated by men and women from\nAustria, France, Switzerland, Germany, USA and Canada. Therefore these\ncountries would be expected to dominate the forthcoming games.\nHowever the Brits do try and throw\na spanner in the works when they can\nand have managed to pull off some\nmonumental achievements in the past:\nIn 2002 at Salt Lake City, Alain Baxter won Britain\u2019s first ever alpine skiing\nmedal but was subsequently stripped\nof it after testing postitive for doping.\nAlthough Baxter still maintains it was\nthe result of a decongestant. At the\nsame games four British women won\ngold in curling (Bowls but on ice and\nwith brooms) much to the acclaim of\nthe British public, although most people would be hard pushed to remember a single name from that team now.\nAt the last Winter Olympics Shelly\nRudman won an unexpected silver\nmedal in the skeleton event (jumping\non a tea tray and speeding down an\nicey tube) and comes into these games\nas a top contender for a medal. Rudman\u2019s fianc\u00e9, Kristan Bromley, who\nalso competes in the skeleton event\nwill be hoping to be among the medals after securing the 2008 World\nChampionship gold medal. In addition the two (wo)man bobsleigh team\nof Nicola Minichiello and Gillian Cook\ncome into the Olympics as 2009 World\nChampions as do the men\u2019s curling\nteam. Cook has become a youtube hit\nafter her bobsleigh suit split just before a race revealing her backside to\nthe television audience. Not a bad way\nto raise the profile of your Olympic\nquest one could suggest. Minichiello\nhas only recently returned to racing\nafter undergoing laser surgery due to\nthe loss of sight in her left eye, this has\nhampered her and Cook\u2019s preparations\nfor the games somewhat. The funding\nbody, UK Sport, have set a target of 3\nmedals for the upcoming games. This\nis an optimistic figure but one that is\nattainable nonetheless. It is better to\nover-achieve than underachieve after\nall.\nProblems have struck the Britsh\nteam in the run up to the games however as the British Ski and Snowboarding Federation are in dire financial difficulties and many athletes have seen\ntheir funding slashed drastically in\nthe past year. This has threatened the\nparticipation of some of the athletes\nat the Olympics, most notably Chemmy Alcott. Alcott is perhaps the most\nrecognisable face of the team going to\nVancouver, she has not set the world of\nski racing alight, and her career could\neven be described as disappointing.\nHowever, her looks have helped her be\nthe most recognisable British Winter\nathlete.\nThe Canadians will be looking to\ndominate their home Olympics, with\nManuel Osborne-Paradis carrying the\nexpectations of a nation in the alpine\ndownhill events, while the Austrians\nand Swiss will be bringing strong and\non-form teams to battle it out for the\nmedals. The women\u2019s alpine events are\ndominated by the American Lindsay\nVonn who, returning from injury this\nseason, has dodged jibes about her\nweight.\nThe events may not provide a great\nopportunity for British victory, but\nthey will be enthralling all the same\nand at least we are sure to beat the\nAussie\u2019s in the medal table. Aren\u2019t we?\n\n"

    "content": "d week\n1-5 February 2010\nIt\u2019s all too easy to associate wheelchairs\nand hearing aids with the word disability, as\nthey are so visible. However the majority of\ndisabilities in the young are \u2018hidden\u2019, including\nthings like specific learning disabilities, mental\nhealth disorders and chronic health disorders.\nDisability is defined as any physical or mental\nimpairment that has a substantial, adverse\nand long-term effect on his/her ability to carry\nout normal day to day activities. For example,\nconditions that are classified as a disability\ncan include:\n\u2022 Mobility difficulties\n\u2022 Aspergers and autism\n\u2022 Chronic health conditions, for\nexample asthma, diabetes and\nepilepsy\n\u2022 Deafness or blindness\n\u2022 Depression, schizophrenia and\neating disorders\nIt\u2019s not about labelling- if someone with\nchronic depression doesn\u2019t want to\ncall it a disability, that\u2019s fine. However,\nacknowledging it as a disability means you\nmay be eligible for additional support. It\u2019s\nabout knowing your rights, and specifically\nthat you are not discriminated against\nbecause of your condition and that you have\nequal opportunities to resources that your\npeers do.\nThings that may be available to disabled\nstudents at Imperial, depending on their\ncircumstances, include:\n\u2022 access to lecture notes in advance\n\u2022 special examination arrangements\n\u2022 financial support from the Disabled\nStudents Allowance\n\u2022 continued eligibility for\naccommodation in halls\nThings like depression and specific learning\ndisabilities are surprisingly common in the\nstudent population and it\u2019s a shame that\nfew people will talk about their experiences\nof it and admit they may need help. There\nare a number of services available but\nthe first point of contact should be the\nCollege\u2019s Disability Advisor. Every person\u2019s\nrequirements are unique so support will\nbe tailored to you, and they will be able to\nsuggest other services which may be of\nbenefit and advocate on your behalf.\nHaving a disability shouldn\u2019t hold you back!\nBelow are some famous people and their\ndisabilities.\nDo you each of their disabilities?\nThe answers are underneath.\nDisability\nthis year saw the birth of Imperial College\nInterfaith; a new committee, comprised\nentirely of students, set up to do just that.\nUniting Christians, Muslims, Jews, Baha\u2019is\n, Jains, Hindus, Sikhs and Buddhists, the\nsociety is taking apart misunderstandings\nbetween faiths by encouraging dialogue.\nThe fantastic opening event in November\n(Unifaith: Road to Dialogue) was a perfect\nexample of interfaith dialogue, bringing\ntogether prominent speakers from eight\ndifferent religions under the one banner of\nunderstanding, and coincided with the UK\u2019s\nfirst ever National Interfaith Week. Rodney\nEastwood, the College Secretary, was also\npresent on the day on behalf of the Rector.\nHe gave testament to the religious and\ncultural diversity of the college community,\nwhich thus necessitated the endorsement\nof such events. We can only truly learn the\nreality of others religions by speaking to\nthose who practice them.\nThis coming week marks the Union\u2019s One\nWorld week, at which Interfaith is set to\nhave a large presence with stalls on Monday\nand a massive Question Time style event\non Religion and Science. The aim is to\nbring different faith perspectives together\nto address the clashing notions of faith and\nscience: do they conflict or complement\neach other? Can the morality we derive\nthrough religion also be drawn from science,\nor is religion exclusive in providing this?\nCan we be scientific about spirituality,\nprayer, consciousness, good works, God\nand our intrinsic beliefs? Regardless of our\nconclusions, we will still be able to work\ntogether towards common objectives.\nThis is Imperial students standing against\nreligious intolerance, creating not just\ntolerance but dialogue and understanding.\nThis is Imperial College Interfaith.\nby Hannah Theodorou\n1 Heather Mills - Amputee 2 Michael J Fox - Parkinson\u2019s Disease 3 John Prescott - Bulimia Nervosa\n4 Billy Connolly - ADHD 5 Stevie Wonder - Blind 6 Stephen Fry - Bipolar Disorder\n7 Richard Branson - Dyslexia 8 Steven Spielberg - Aspergers 9 Halle Berry - Diabetes\n\n"

The story\nfocuses on Malik El Djebena, a 19 year\nold Arabic man who is given a 6 year\nsentence in a corrupted French jail. He\nenters the prison with no family, no\nreligion, and no friends. His only distinctive previous home was a Juvenile\nhall, and is now left alone in a cruel\nnew world.\nWith a six year stretch ahead of him,\nMalik is clearly vulnerable within the\nprison walls. At first, the na\u00efve Malik\nhas every intention of keeping his head\ndown in the prison where he is noticeably out of his depth. Unfortunately\nthe prison has other plans for him.\nHe is approached by a group of Corsican inmates, who control everything\nthat happens within the prison.

He must initially overcome his conscience before he can kill\na stranger. The scene is gut twistingly\nintense yet vividly real.\nMalik is played by Tahar Rahim, who\nwas relatively unknown before the film,\nbut has shot into the limelight with a\nfantastic debut. Rahim produces a gritty\nperformance, evolving brilliantly from\ntimid teenager to criminal mastermind.\nDuring Malik\u2019s stay, the prison\u2019s\ndemographics change, to which he\ntakes full advantage. He slowly gains\nthe trust of Corsican kingpin C\u00e9sar,\nwhilst involving himself within a group\nof Arabic prisoners, who aim to take\ncontrol of the prison. Battling between\nthe politics of prison life and his own\nsurvival, Malik mercilessly attempts to\nclimb the criminal ladder in and out of\nthe prison. The film constructs a brilliant insight into life within a prison,\nand makes anything conjured up in\nfilms like The Shawshank Redemption\nlook like a weekend stay at a Holiday\nInn. The brutal dog-eat-dog world\nnever forgives or takes a break.\nKingpin C\u00e9sar is played superbly by\nNiels Arestrup. The cold hearted man\nslowly deteriorates to desperation as\nthe world that he previously ruled\ncrumbles around him. C\u00e9sar\u2019s evident\nweakness becomes Malik\u2019s strength in\nhis path to glory. Malik is reborn within the prison where he experiences\na new type of paradoxical independence which he could not experience\nin the outside world. The film is made\nwith near perfect execution. Director\nJacques Audiard produces a claustrophobic view of prison life, whilst maintaining a gripping portrayal of Malik\u2019s\nrise in the prison hierarchy. Jacques\nAudiard won the 2005 Best Director award for The Beat that my Heart\nThe cause of the mass destruction is\nnever explained and the audience is\nnever encouraged to care. The point\nis everything has died. No plants or\nanimals have existed for the past few\nyears. It\u2019s only the humans who have\nsurvived, and since all we make is\ntrouble, this sets the perfect apocalyptic scene. An unnamed man (Viggo\nMortensen) and his son (Kodi SmitMcPhee) struggle on, heading south,\nhoping it will be warmer and more\nhabitable. Their journey is never easy\nsince man has turned against each oth-er, resorting to theft, murder, rape and\ncannibalism. The na\u00efve son, who still\nhas his youth and innocence intact,\nis desperate for them to be \u201cthe good\nguys.\u201d And the father doesn\u2019t have the\nheart to tell him that not everything\nworks that way. But of course, when\nsociety has been damaged to such an\nextent, survival involves getting your\nhands dirty, an idea never fully grasped\nby the boy who was born during the\nmost unfortunate times.\nSmit-McPhee is convincing in his\npurest, boyish form, shocked and horrified at every dishonesty and moral\ncorruption from his surroundings.\nMortensen gives a truly moving performance as the father who will do literally anything to protect his son; he\u2019s\neven prepared to shoot the boy himself\nto spare him the misery and pain of being captured by a hungry band of can-nibals. The relationship between the\ntwo is never over-done. The boy is by\nno means too vulnerable to be cute,\nand the man is not portrayed as the\nomnipotent superhero who is capable\nof saving his son time after time. There\nis a raw, genuine connection between\nthe father and son who aren\u2019t perfect.\nAs the film progresses the conflict of\nideals between the two becomes more\napparent. The man is prepared to steal\nand kill for survival whereas through\nthe eyes of the boy, one should never\ndo such things no matter what the\ncircumstances.\nA couple of equally talented actors\nplay minor roles. Charlize Theron\nplays the wife in flashbacks and Robert Duvall plays an old man who is also\nwandering aimlessly. They have very\nlittle screen-time and although it\u2019s easy\nto think that their acting abilities were\nunder used, The Road reminds us that\nthis is strictly a film about Mortensen\nand Smit-McPhee and doesn\u2019t deviate\naway from that.\nThe scenery couldn\u2019t be more de-pressing. Dead trees and crops line\nthe pathway and there isn\u2019t even an\ninch of greenery in sight which is the\ntruly terrifying nature of the film. The\nbare, grey emptiness constantly reminds us of death and destruction\nall-round. Even when we do see\nhumans, it\u2019s never a welcoming\nsight, since they\u2019re most likely\nto be violent gangs of cannibals\nwho will stop at nothing to eat\na bit of flesh.\nThe Road is a truly heart-felt\nportrayal of love, pain and human values during the chilling\ndays of a devastating apocalypse.\nThe brutal reality of human nature\nis never easy to stomach, but what\nthe film shows is the ugly, inconven-Skipped, a Parisian criminal thriller\nabout an aspiring pianist. Audiard\nwill be undoubtedly a commanding\ncontender for this year\u2019s prize and is\ncertainly a name to look out for in the\nfuture. A Prophet won Best film award\nat BFI London film festival and Grand\nPrix at the Cannes film festival, and it\u2019s\nclearly visible why. This powerhouse\nproduction contains a potent formula\nfor a fierce prison thriller that\u2019s definitely worth seeing.\nmore de-crops line\nt even an\nhich is the\nfilm.

    "content": "away from this level of club promotion and concentrated on selling music around the world and in that time\nalso the licensing laws changed and\nclubs compete with bars; things have\ngotten more thinly spread over town.\nI think it was great that the clubs were\npacked. You couldnt book a venue in\nBrighton on a weekend night as clubs\nwere so popular, and now you can easily go and get a club for a birthday par-ty. Back then it meant people had to\nwork hard to deliver something special and parties were bigger. But I am\nnot one to dwell on how things used\nto be, as I am as excited about our music and nights as I ever was. Brighton\nis an ever-changing and developing\nmusic town and that remains strong.\nWhen the label was smaller you\nmust have been choosing your artists personally, has that changed?\nWhen we started we did tended\nto sign people based in Brighton, or\nfriends of people down here, so that\nmeant Nostalgia 77, Natural Self,\nQuantic, Bonobo etc. Nowadays\nwe get sent demos from all over the\nworld. But in a way our scene (which\ndoesnt really have a name) has a network across the world. So we are\nfriends with the labels who do our\nmusic all over the world and so it feels\nlike the same family in Brighton, but\nin a larger sense.\nConsidering your releases range\nfrom electronica and drum & bass\nto soul & funk, what is the unifying\nthread between all the artists you\nhave signed?\nRob picks the acts based on something that he likes in their specific ear\nfor a tune. So when we signed Flevans\nthe first time around he was doing\nmusic on a 4 track, but Rob liked his\nquirky sounds and how he put them\ntogether. Flevans thought it was a\nmate pretending to be Rob, when Rob\ncalled him. Rob has never told me this,\nbut Flevans mentioned that he thinks\nhe told him in colourful language to\num, go away. But all of our acts have\na certain individual sound and that is\nwhat we are drawn to.\nIn which musical directions are you\nlooking to expand the label?\nLast year was our 10th birthday year and it was enjoyable\ndoing the parties and our special 3 disc booklet. But we\nalso sat at the end of the year\nand decided that we wanted\nto take the label back to its\nroute of more future looking music. This year we have\nsigned Maddslinky aka Zed\nBias, who is collaborating with\nand getting mixes from people\nlike Toddla T, MJ Cole, Omar,\nSkream, Mr Scruff, Blame and\nAtJazz, which is an exciting\nproject with all these quality\nartists from a range of gen-res. We have also got a double\ncompilation album form Zero\ndB (Ninja Tune) and then add\nTru\nThoughts\n21\nfelix FRIDAY 29 JANUARY 2010\nmusic.felix@imperial.ac.uk MUSIC\nFounded in 1999 by Paul Jonas and Robert Luis, Tru Thoughts independent record label has been managing leading\njazz, funk, soul and hip hop artists for the past ten years. Kadhim Shubber gets in a word with Paul Jonas\nTen years of independence: Tru Thoughts\nW\nhat were your\naims when you\nfounded Tru\nThoughts? What\nwas the label\u2019s\nraison d\u2019etre?\nWe started the label in 1999 from\nRob Luis\u2019 stairwell and the reason for\nstarting the label was that we were\nrunning a weekly club night (called\nphonic:hoop) and we noticed promoters were coming in and pinching our\nacts, so we thought that if we released\ntheir music then we would create a\nroster of acts for both club and label.\nMusically we wanted to release soul,\njazz and funk, but in its more contemporary terms.\nHas it changed at all over the last\nten years?\nI think our love of music and our\ndreams of running a label have re-mained, and the people we work with\non the label, in the office and day to\nday follow that same philosophy. Musically it has been an enjoyable jour-ney. We have always supported our\nkey producers on the journeys they\nhave taken. So Nostalgia 77 went\nfrom hip hop, funky 7s to winning the\nJohn Peel Play More Jazz Award with\nhis jazz releases, Quantic went from\nbedroom producer to fronting a funk\nband (Quantic Soul Orchestra) and\nthen moving to Colombia and making\nmusic with artists from South America (Quantic and his Combo Barbaro)\nand Lance from The Bamboos has\ndone music as The Bamboos (funk\nand soul), Lanu (broken beat and\ndance music) and introduced us to\nKylie Auldist (soul, jazz, funk singer).\nAll of these journeys have happened\norganically and we have been involved\nall the way. We may not have planned\nall the stages, but we have enjoyed\nwhere they have gone and have supported them.\nWhen you were running it from underneath Rob Luis\u2019 stairs, did you\nthink that you\u2019d reach your tenth\nanniversary?\nHa ha, no chance! I was running\naround trying to not get caught\nputting posters in illegal places and\nRob was mostly buying and developing his huge record collection.\nHow did the label fit in with the\nmusic scene in Brighton around the\nmillennium? Do you think nowadays that the Brighton music scene\nis assumed to just involve skinny\njeaned indie pop?\nWhen we started the label, the town\nwas popular for the style of ourselves,\nSkint and Catskills Records. Trip hop,\nnu jazz, big beat, whatever the names\nwere, it was a stage where people\nwere sampling, looping, cutting up\nand mixing styles. Very hip hop in its\nbase, but with a world of influences.\nOur weekly night (and our Mr Scruff\nmonthly night) pulled in around 2000\npeople a month, so there were some\namazing parties. We have changed\nthings around over the years, moved\nAn independent record label formed in\nPrince\u2019s party\nyear of 1999,\nin Brighton,\nby Robert\nLuis and\nPaul Jonas.\nSpecialising\nin electronic\nmusic they\nreleased their\nfirst records\nin 2000\nthey now\nhave over 30\nsuccessful\nrecording\nartists and\ncounting.\nto this the more classic sound of The\nBamboos (check out the video of On\nThe Sly on YouTube) and Quantic\u2019s\nFlowering Inferno project.\nIf you could sign anyone, who would\nyou take on?\nWe have had the pleasure of working with a lot of the people we wanted\nto. There have been one or two acts\nin ten years that we have tried to sign\nand lost, but it is a pretty small percentage thankfully. We were sad to see\nAlice Russell leave the label, but this\ncan happen when acts want to try a\ndifferent route to selling music. It is\ncomplicated to explain, but people\nhave different ways of looking to sell\nmusic and we have a certain model\nthat has worked well for us and attracts some acts, but with Alice she\nwanted a different form. We hope\nshe will record for us in some form\nagain soon. In terms of others, well\nwe would want to get some massive\nacts of course! I dont know maybe the\nQuantic/Stevie Wonder album is what\nwe should aim at!\nHow did the Unfold/Tru Thoughts\nCovers album come about? Was that\nyour idea or the artists?\nWhen the Quantic Soul Orchestra\nalbum was being put together Quantic\nand ourselves felt that the retro cover\nversion was an overdone thing, and\nso Will (Quantic) did versions of Mr\nScruff, Sunshine Anderson and 4Hero.\nThat theme has stayed throughout the\nlabel with Nostalgia 77 and Alice doing Seven Nation Army, The Bamboos\ndoing Max Sedgley\u2019s Happy etc\u2026 and\nwe got asked a lot to put them all on an\nalbum. We felt conscious of the whole\nMark Ronson thing, but wanted to put\nthem out anyway as we have ten years\nof them. It is a great album. Really\nhandy for party DJing!\nTell us about Zebra Traffic. How did\nthat get started?\nWe always wanted hip hop to be\na part of our releases. We felt that it\nneeded its own label (and hip hop\nbuyers are a bit unforgiving if you mix\ngenres!) but one of the key things was\nthe potential of releasing music by Phi\nLife Cypher and Life, who remain one\nof the best crews the UK\nhas seen.\nAre there any plans for\nan album of hip hop\ncovers by Tru Thoughts\nartists? We thought that\nHot 8 Brass Band would\nsound good covering\nSnoop Dogg and maybe\nAlice Russell covering\nWu Tang Clan. What do\nyou think?\nNice idea! I might pinch\nthat, Thanks!!! Alice doing Wu Tang would be\nclassic.\nTru Thoughts has prospered in a time when\nindependent labels and\nrecordshops also have been in de-cline. What has Tru Thoughts done\ndifferently?\nThis comes down to where I mentioned the way that we run the label.\nWe started with little money so we\nhad to do everything ourselves, and\nthis kind of stuck over the years. We\nare careful with money and let the music do the talking. If a country loves a\ncertain album then we put money in\nto support that and so on and so forth.\nSome feel this is us being too cautious,\nbut we have unfortunately seen so\nmany of our favourite labels go down\nbecause they took big risks. We want\nto be around for the next 30 years and\nonwards.\nIncreasingly, records are being released through vinyl and mp3 only,\ndo you think that combination is the\nfuture?\nThe business is ever changing. Vinyl was dead a few years ago and now\npeople are saying it is becoming more\npopular (it is growing in the States for\ninstance). We keep an eye on changes\nand consider each release on what we\nthink will work. We still sell a good\nI was running\naround trying to not\nget caught putting\nposters in illegal\nplaces and Rob was\nmostly buying and\ndeveloping his huge\nrecord collection.\n\u201c\n\u201d\nHOT 8 BRASS\nBAND\n\u201cA true New\nOrleans brass\nband\u201d\nQUANTIC\n\u201cDeep funk,\njazz and tough\ndrums\u201d\nALICE\nRUSSELL\n\u201cA soulful and\ntimeless voice\u201d\nTHE\nBAMBOOS\n\u201cDrum-break\ndriven grooves\u201d\nnumber of CDs worldwide and the album format does tend to be central to\nour ways of working music.\nHow do you think the music industry will overcome the problem\nof music piracy? Or continue to be\nprofitable in a world where people\ndownload music for free?\nIt won\u2019t be able to overcome it I\nthink, it is a rare business where the\nthing it sells \u2013 the CD \u2013 can be easily\ngiven out between people for free in\nthe same quality. That will remain. For\nus we hope that enough people don\u2019t\nwant to do that. I buy music when I\nwant to get something as I want the\nartist to get paid and make more\nmoney. This attitude is shared by a lot\nof people I feel. Maybe we won\u2019t sell\na million cds but we might just sell\n100,000 and we can make a living and\nrelease more music for that.\nDo you have any tips for musicians\nwho want to copy Tru Thoughts\nmodel of starting a label to release\ntheir own material? Or for anyone\nbrave enough to go about starting\ntheir own label?\nI think it is all about promoting\nthe music. The worst thing people\ndo when they start a club night for\ninstance is think that they can put a\nsmall advert in one mag and then their\nclub will be full. You have to poster, ad-vertise, do online promo, tell everyone\nyou have ever met and go into every\nshop in Brighton and invite them. The\nsame is the case for a label. The music\nbit is the simple bit. You then have to\nwork hard. Don\u2019t be put off though.\nIt is a a great job to have.

Not likely, he says\nIn a long line of mishaps involving the\nCity & Guilds College Union, their\nVice President (Finance & Societies)\nRikki Norris has been criticised for his\nabsence about College, but has now\nspoken to felix to clarify the situation.\nOn 21st January, the CGCU\u2019s news\nwebsite Live! reported that Jenny Wilson had to take up some the slack created by Norris\u2019s absence by processing nearly \u00a32,000 worth of claims. Mr.\nNorris has since said he has been ill for\nan \u201cextended period of time\u201d, and feels\nthat the Live! article is largely unfair to\nhim in light of his illness.\nHis disappearance has been largely\ncondemned by the news website and\nits readers leaving comments on the\narticle, even citing comments from\nUnion officers such as Deputy President (Welfare) John James.

Try it at Thai Taste.\nThai food has one too many choices\nT\nhe following waffle is my\ntypical thought process\nupon scanning a Thai\nrestaurant menu, and the\nconfusingly colossal conundrum of choices which engulf my\nbrain. \u2018I want something light, refresh-ing, and a bit spicy. Perhaps a salad.\nActually I could go for something a tad\nheavier, so I\u2019ll go for something more\nrich and unctuous, packed full of herbaceous flavours. A curry fits the bill.\nOn second thought, something more\nsimple and punchy will do it for me,\nperhaps a stir fry. Ah, but I want that\nubiquitous soup which encompasses\nsweet, sour, hot and salty flavours.\nOh but that noodle dish always hits\nthe spot\u2026 But they\u2019ve got those crab\ncakes\u2026\u2019\nI\u2019m normally a bit disoriented at this\npoint so I just make my decision based\non my gut feeling. Nine times out of\nten, upon receipt of my delicacy, I\u2019m\npretty happy with it. But there is that\nodd occasion where I peer across at the\ndelights on a neighbouring table and\nthink that perhaps my decision wasn\u2019t\nthe best one after all; a thought which\nis really hammered home when a whiff\nof those hot-off-the-wok scents meander their way into my nose. I don\u2019t\nlike this feeling of leaving the restaurant wishing I\u2019d chosen an even more\nmouth-watering alternative, or that I\u2019d\nloosened my belt, emptied my wallet\nand tried a bit of everything. So I write\nthis article with a view to helping make\nchoosing the right dishes that tad eas-ier, and to help others avoid that feeling of gastronomic regret. I\u2019m going\nto keep it simple by picking out some\nnoteworthy dishes at the two best lo-cally-based mid-ranged Thai eateries,\nAddie\u2019s Thai Caf\u00e9 and Thai Taste.\nNeither restaurant has a particularly\nstriking d\u00e9cor nor unique ambience,\nbut both are pretty effective at doing what they set out to do. I like the\nchic-ness and informality of Addie\u2019s\nChris Sim visits Addie\u2019s Thai Cafe and Thai Taste and found many treats were awaiting. But how did they compare?\nand it\u2019s definitely the better of the two\nfor gathering a lively group for some\nbanter or as a pit-stop before a night\nout. Thai Taste appears more formal\nto the eye with its all-white interior,\nyet somehow feels more laid back. No\nmatter which restaurant your foodie\nsixth sense has led you into, the arrival\nof the menu signals the commencement of that daunting challenge of\nchoosing your tummy-fillers. Both\nrestaurants have the spectrum of Thailand\u2019s culinary masterpieces pretty\ncomprehensively covered, but for me,\neach had one standout dish.\nSom tam (papaya salad), sticky coconut rice and grilled chicken is just one\nof those combinations which makes\nyou think that they should create a\nNobel Prize for Gastronomy for the\ngenius who conceived this immaculate trinity of joy. Since trying it on\nthe streets on Bangkok I have craved\nto find a source of this pleasure closer\nto home, and fortunately for me, Thai\nTaste does a pretty good rendition of\nit. The slight crunch of the papaya and\nits spicy yet subtly sweet sauce, combined which the meaty chicken flesh\nand its beautifully caramelised skin is\nmarried with the mellow richness of\nthe rice to create an uplifting flavour\ncombination. True comfort food. Addie\u2019s star act isn\u2019t too bad either. The\nenglish translation of this dish\u2019s name\ndoesn\u2019t quite do it justice. \u2018Grilled\nneck end pork with special sauce\u2019. But\nit could be called anything to be hon-est, and it wouldn\u2019t take anything away\nfrom the tender pork with its distinctly\nbarbeque-esque overtones, accompanied by a sweet sauce containing lively\nchilli and refreshing coriander.\nBoth do the classics pretty well too\nand whilst these dishes weren\u2019t quite\nup to the standard found in the Land\nof Smiles, they weren\u2019t too far off. Thai\nTaste\u2019s Pad Thai had an appropriate injection of tamarind, a touch of\nsweetness and was pleasingly complemented with generously-sized prawns.\nAt the same time, Addie\u2019s Roast Duck\nCurry comprised juicy duck pieces\nembalmed in a fragrant coconut sauce,\ncreated with an optimal amount of\nlemongrass and sweet basil.\nYou might\u2019ve guessed from the above\nthat the overall level of skillsmanship\nof both restaurants\u2019 culinary creations\nmeans that Thai Taste and Addie\u2019s are\npretty much level pegging in the food\ndepartment. Service is pleasantly efficient at both, and portion sizes are\npretty agreeable considering most\nmain dishes cost between \u00a37-9. To\nconclude, whilst it is normally my job\nto name which restaurant triumphs\nover the other, on this rare occasion,\nit\u2019s too close to call. But at the very\nleast, I do hope that this article has\nprovided you with gastronomic guidance when paying a visit to either of\nthese fine establishments.\nFood: Equally Tasty: 9.0\nValue: Equally Priced: 8.0\nService: Equally Efficient: 7.0\nAmbience: Equally Average:\n7.0\nOverall: 8.0/10\nA great way to beat the winter blues... indulge in some chocolate\nHolly Cumbers shows that a bit of care and thought can go a long way in discovering the right chocolate\nI\nhave been making a promise\nto myself for the last couple of\nweeks now, to eat extremely\nhealthily and to start going to\nthe gym regularly to make up\nfor all the fatty foods I have eaten over\nChristmas. But then I realised that\nnot only was this impossible but also\ngoing to be extremely boring. So this\nweek I have decided to write an article\nall about chocolate, (well to be more\nprecise, about ways you can select the\nmost mouth watering chocolate \u2013 even\nwithout blowing your budget at Hotel\nChocolat) as a protest to the amount\nof articles in popular magazines at the\nmoment about dieting! Articles which\nI personally think are a lot more boring\nthan any revision we all have to endure\nover the following weeks!\nThe most important thing about ensuring you buy a chocolate to be proud\nof is to carefully examine its ingredi-ents; these are the only things which\ndetermine whether a chocolate is to be\nleft on the shelf or lovingly consumed.\nDark chocolate is, I believe, the one you\nreally have to get right; buying a horrible dark chocolate really isn\u2019t very nice\nand leaves you with a sour taste in your\nmouth. A good dark chocolate should\ninclude; plenty of cocoa, (bear in mind\nthat cocoa gives a strong flavour and\ntherefore the more the cocoa, the\nstronger the flavour) sugar or other\nnatural sweeteners and cocoa butter.\nMake sure you avoid buying any dark\nchocolate which includes vanillin, or\nartificial flavourings. Also, for all you\nhealth fanatics out there (and I am\nsure you will already know this) dark\nchocolate is by far the healthiest.\nGetting a good milk\nchocolate is also very\nsatisfying and there is a\nlot of difference between\na good milk chocolate\nand the most basic you\ncan get. The ingredients\nshould include all those\nthat are in dark chocolate and, obviously, milk.\nI personally prefer milk\nchocolate with cream, as I\nfind this has a richer and\nsmoother taste, however,\nit can also be in the form of\nmilk powder or whole milk;\nit might be worth experimenting with different milk\nchocolates to see which one you\nprefer.\nI have decided not to discuss\nthe best ingredients for white\nchocolate \u2013 after all, it can be disputed\nwhether it is actually chocolate at all\ndue to its lack of cocoa \u2013 in my mind\nthe essential ingredient of chocolate. I\nhave also found that most chocoholics\nI have met also tend to dislike white\nchocolate, claiming it is far too sweet.\nI am sorry if I have offended you in my\nneglect of white chocolate!\nFor all the fellow chocoholics out\nthere, you can now buy a\nchocolate pizza on the internet, which\nwill surely help you through dooming\nweeks of revision and the depressing\nJanuary blues! The pizza is available in\nfive chocolaty flavours; dark chocolate\nwith cranberries; smarties mixed with\njelly beans and white chocolate; hon-eycomb; chocolate brownie and finally\nmarshmallows mixed with Belgium\nchocolate.\nTrust me, the pictures alone are\nenough to get your mouth to water,\nlet alone the taste. On a closing note,\nyou shouldn\u2019t feel guilty when scoffing\nyour face with chocolate \u2013 I think we\nall do deserve it!\n\n"

Only this time it wasn\u2019t\nabout bombings, shootings\nor kidnappings, but the extra- marital\naffair of NI\u2019s First Lady, Iris Robinson.\nGood old normal politics had finally\nreturned to Northern Ireland. But\nwhile an affair between a 59 year old\nand a teenager could happen anywhere,\nthe response to the affair was uniquely\nNorthern Irish. Nowhere else could\nsuch an incident have triggered the\nthreat of increased sectarian tension.\nAnd yet this is exactly what is at stake\nin a frighteningly fragile peace process.\nThe slightest hiccup could bring the\nwhole house of cards crashing down\nand threaten to restart the longest civil\nwar in world history which claimed\nover 3,500 lives during the last 40 years\nand has left many living in segregation,\nstill viewing \u2018the other side\u2019 through a\nprism of suspicion and fear. The causes\nof the \u2018Troubles\u2019 are complex but religious intolerance is clearly the main\nculprit.\nIreland has had a painful history of\nreligious intolerance dating back to\nthe infamous Penal Laws, banning or\nattacking anything Catholic in predominantly Catholic Ireland, the denial of soup to those who would not\nconvert to Protestantism during the\nFamine which was to claim a million\nlives and vicious retaliations leading to\nthe slaughter of innocent Protestants.\nAnd yet there is nothing whatsoever\nin the teachings of either Christian denomination that justifies this; nothing\nthat should have lead to such violence.\nRather, it has been ignorance and political opportunism that has caused so\nmany of these tragedies; and continues\nto threaten them today. The ability to\nturn religious difference into religious\nintolerance relies on the ability to misrepresent differing opinions while alluding to political and social prejudice.\nI remember a ten year old Catholic\nchild boy telling me that of course he\nknew Protestant beliefs, \u201cDon\u2019t they\nbelieve in God the dog and God the\ncow and all that?\u201d Reverend Ian Paisley himself denounced the Pope as the\nantichrist to his face. It is when religion ceases to be about God and turns\ntribal that religious intolerance thrives.\nCatholicism means being a Republican and Protestantism means wanting\nBritish rule; these are hijackings of re-ligion. There was never a petrol bomb\nthrown in the name of the Sacrament\nof Confession or a bomb in defiance of\npapal authority; rather it was people\nabusing religion for their own ends.\nThis is not just an Irish problem. Increasingly, being a Muslim can be seen\nto mean simply being against \u2018American Imperialism\u2019. A no doubt insulting\nthought for true Islamic believers and\nyet Islam was so clearly abused in the\ncase of the failed December bomber\nUmar Farouk Abdulmutallab, ex-pres-ident of the UCL Islamic Society. It is\nagainst such people that all religions\nmust unite. We cannot deny the immense and powerful beliefs common\nto all our faiths. We cannot allow prejudice to cloud our view of other reli-gions. Yet it is people such as Abdulmutallab who claim centre stage- just\nas with Northern Ireland it has often\nbeen the extremists whose bombs\nspoke louder than the prayers of oth-ers. As the great Irishman W B Yeats\nsaid, \u201cThe best lack all conviction,\nwhile the worst are full of passionate\nintensity\u201d.\nBut the \u2018best\u2019 are out there; challenging religious intolerance and promoting interreligious understanding. This\nyear saw the birth of Imperial College\nInterfaith; a new society, comprised\nentirely of students, set up to do just\nthat. Uniting Christians, Muslims,\nBaha\u2019is, Jains, Hindus, Jews, Sikhs and\nBuddhists, the society is taking apart\nmisunderstandings between faiths by\nencouraging dialogue. The fantastic\nopening event in November (Unifaith)\nwas a perfect example of this, bringing\ntogether speakers from six different\nreligions under the one banner of un-derstanding. This coming week marks\nthe Union\u2019s One World week, at which\nInterfaith is set to have a large presence\nwith stalls on Monday and a massive\nQuestion Time style event on science\nand religion. This is Imperial students\nstanding against religious intolerance,\ncreating not just passive tolerance but\ndialogue and understanding. This is\nImperial College Interfaith.\nDavidStewarthasdiettipsforthefatandlazy\n\u201cIreland has a\npainful history\nof religious\nintolerance\u201d\nS\nuppose you\u2019re worried about\nyour weight. Perhaps you feel\nyou could lose a few pounds.\nThe modern way to deal with\nthese feelings is to smother\nthem with anti-depressants, so you\ncould take a fistful of Prozac washed\ndown with a tub of Ben and Jerry\u2019s and\ncall it irony.\nStill, some people are picky and may\nentertain certain objections with this\nadvice. If you\u2019re one of these people,\nyou will have to investigate other med-ications. There is a panoply of substances you can take these days, which\nmight seem daunting to the prospective pill-junkie, so I\u2019ve reviewed a few\nof the current offerings on the market.\nAlli is the latest drug to be released,\nand unusually, it\u2019s actually legal as well,\nwhich is of course a bonus. Alli is a li-pid-absorption blocker. In other words\nit\u2019s a Fat-Shitting Drug (FSD). Because\nfats aren\u2019t absorbed by the digestive\nsystem, they will appear in your faeces.\nThis means that you will be curling out\noily turds, which, depending on the\namount of fat you\u2019ve eaten, can make\nthem so greasy and loose that they can\nactually slip out during the day. Eat\nenough KFC and your rectum can get\nso full of grease that a fart will splatter\noil all over your underwear. In combination with white shorts, this is a great\nidea for a dare.\n2,4-Dinitrophenol (DNP) was one of\nthe first to be invented and remains the\nmost effective, some consider it a \u2018wonder drug\u2019. Your cellular currency for\nenergy is called ATP. Once it is spent,\nit becomes ADP, which must then be\nrecharged again. The process for doing\nthis, \u2018chemiosmosis\u2019, involves a huge\ncylindrical molecule, rotated about by\nthe passage of hydrogen ions across\nan electrical potential. As the molecule spins round it adds a phosphate\ngroup onto the ADP molecule, turning it back to ATP again. DNP blocks\nthis process, allowing protons to flow\nunhindered across the potential, doing\nno work and simply generating heat.\nYour body then burns more food to replace this energy. Upshot: you get hot,\nyou lose weight. This might make you\nsweat like a pig. In fact it was banned\nwhen people took so much of it that\nthey died of a fatal fever. Also associated with cataracts in women.\nNext, there\u2019s Ephedrine. Your nerve\ncells can\u2019t tell the difference between\nthis drug and adrenaline. However,\nEphedrine causes your nerve cells to\nfire much more rapidly. Upshot: ephedrine makes you hyper, suppresses\nyour appetite and helps you concen-trate. Sounds good except you might\nbe busting for a piss which you can\u2019t\nsqueeze out and paranoid that people\nare laughing at your inability to uri-nate. Also you can get acne. Or die. Often mixed with caffeine and aspirin to\nform an \u2018ECA stack\u2019.\nGet a tapeworm. (Warning: Don\u2019t\nread this while eating). A Big Mac\nshared is a Big Mac halved. Imagine\nyou have a tapeworm, whom for sake\nof argument we\u2019ll call Terry. Terry is\nlike a mate who follows you around all\nday with a fork picking at your plate\nof food. The only difference is that\nhe lets you eat it first. He gets fat so\nyou don\u2019t have to. Terry can grow to a\nmetre in length inside your guts soaking up all your Snickers\u2019 and stuffed\ncrust pizzas. The only trouble is that\nyou\u2019ll need to abort Terry before he\ngets too long because otherwise you\nmight find him burrowing his way\nout of your abdomen or the walls of\nyour anus. If this happens, wave a banana around your bum-hole, grab him\nwhen he comes out to investigate and\nthen slowly wrap him around a pencil.\nYou can decide how lavish to make the\nfuneral.\nTry the Atkins diet. The idea is to\ncut all carbohydrates out of your diet,\nthereby teaching your body to me-tabolise fat and protein. So you can\neat as much meat as you like. Have the\nburger, not the bun; the sausages, not\nthe mash. Kebab vendors can be very\nhelpful, and there\u2019s nothing quite like\nordering a box of meat. Also, as it\u2019s a\ncarbohydrate, this also means you can\u2019t\ndrink alcohol, which is probably the\nmain reason you actually lose weight.\nUnfortunately, since your diet will be\nessentially that of a desert jackal, you\ncan expect to smell like one.\nNow, the real boon comes from combining all these at once. Get yourself infected with a tapeworm, start swallowing your FSD, DNP and ECA and don\u2019t\neven look at a potato. Then you can expect to find yourself pimple-covered,\ntaking a sweaty winter stroll through\nHyde Park in your underwear, while\nyou munch your way through a can of\nPrince\u2019s hotdogs, farting grease into\nyour increasingly transparent briefs so\nthat the seething mass of worm heads\npoking out of your rectum are on view\nto passers-by, who will be vomiting in\nhorror and calling the police to have\nyou taken away and sectioned.\nBut of course, if you find such a prospect horrifically depressing we have a\nsolution for that\u2026\nRoryFentonworriesforIrishpolitics\n\u201cImagine you have\na tapeworm, whom\nfor the sake of\nargument we\u2019ll call\nTerry\u201d\n\n"

After all the hype,\ncould the much rumoured Apple tablet\npossibly deliver?\nApple is aiming the iPad (not the iS-late, iTablet or iPod HD/Maxi) to fit in\nbetween your laptop and smartphone,\na device space that doesn\u2019t necessarily\nexist at the moment that is normally\ncovered by the netbook or eReader. If\nyou had your hopes pinned on a fully\nfledged tablet computer I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m\ngoing to have to disappoint you, the\niPad is essentially just a giant iPod\ntouch. It may have a few fancy features like a 9.7 inch screen and an\nApple developed 1GHz processor\nnamed the A4, but essentially it\u2019s the\nsame capacitive-touch screen experience you are already familiar with.\nOn-board the device you\u2019ve got\ncustom versions of the usual apps\nyou\u2019ve come to expect on Apple iDe-vices: iTunes and the iTunes store\nincluding the App Store, Maps, Calendar, Mobile Safari and email, each\nlooking like a cross between what\nyou find on a Mac and the iPhone.\nThe main difference comes when\nyou explore the greater real-estate\nprovided by the new screen size.\nThe Email app for instance provides\nan experience similar to that of a\ndesktop with a two-pane view displaying a list and an email preview.\nLikewise browsing on the iPad is\nlike that on the desktop with a fairly standard 1024x768 display.\nSomething that\u2019s brand new for\nthe iPad is Apple\u2019s movement into\nthe eBook market with iBooks. Essentially aiming to be the iTunes\nmusic store of books coupled with\nan eBook reader application on\nthe iPad, the iBooks store allows\nyou to buy and read ePub books.\nI\u2019m not sure what the screen reading experience is going to be like\non that LCD, but Amazon should\ndefinitely be scared.\nText is entered on iPad via a\nvirtual chiclet-style keyboard\nwhich looks like a cross between\nthat found on an iPhone and a\nMacBook.\nThe iPad essentially runs\niPhone OS and therefore can\nrun almost all App Store apps\neither at native or 2x resolution with more iPad specific\napps in the works including an\niPad version of iWork.\nThe iPad will be available\nwith WiFi only in 60 days from\n$499 and WiFi+3G in 90 days\nfrom $649.

In an interview with the BBC he stressed that despite\nthe data in the report being questionable, it \u201cdoes not detract\nfrom the fact that the glaciers are melting.\u201d This news comes\nat a time when the credibility of climate science is still uncertain following the leaked emails from the UEA Climate Unit\nlate last year.\nArjun Hassard\nArjun Hassard\nThis may end up in the bullshit graveyard of sensationalist physics specula-tion, but seemingly impossible occurrences \u2013 such as a shattered pane of\nglass returning instantaneously to its\noriginal form, a Latte separating back\ninto pure coffee and milk, or Megan\nFox replying to my emails \u2013 are not as\nconceptually absurd as they may appear at first glance.\nTake the Starbucks Skinny Cinnamon\nDolce Latte for example. Intuition tells\nus that once you have mixed the key ingredients of coffee, milk, cinnamon and\npretentiousness, you can never recover\nthem in their pure form. Yet the laws of\nphysics that we worship and occasionally tattoo on ourselves are for the most\npart \u2018time-invariant\u2019 \u2013 in lay-douche\nterms, that means they work just as well\ngoing forwards and backwards in time.\nThey are fundamentally symmetrical\nequations. So why can\u2019t the chav un-break a library window and un-verdict\nhimself an ASBO?\nThe reason is that in the real world\n(i.e. the one where Mr T is not allowed\nto randomly murder warlocks) \u2013 the\nmajority of physical processes are \u2018irreversible\u2019. This is governed by the\nsuper-exciting \u2018Second Law of Thermodynamics\u2019\n, which states that the change\nin entropy of a system is always posi-tive. The entropy of a physical system\nis its extent of disarray, essentially the\nnumber of ways in which the system\ncan be arranged. Windows can be shat-tered, which increases disorder, but\nwill never spontaneously un-shatter.\nGases disperse naturally (especially in\ncrowded elevators), but will not spontaneously compress themselves. Therefore the \u2018entropy of the universe\u2019 always\nincreases. (Disclaimer: for every macroscopic system there IS a finite possibility that the entropy can decrease, but the\nprobability of this happening is so small\nthat it is unlikely to have occurred once\nsince the beginning of the universe.\nEven if you had a million baboons conducting thermodynamics experiments\nall day since the dawn of time. No toilet\nbreaks. I\u2019m serious.)\nSo what this clown Lorenzo Maccone\nreckons is that counter-intuitive decreases in entropy happen all the time,\nthe snag is that we just fail to remember\nthem! Before you sigh and flick to the\ncentre page (I\u2019ve seen it already and I can\nquite sincerely say unless you are bulimic it\u2019s not worth it), Maccone claims his\nfindings do not violate any laws of quantum physics. Plus he went to MIT, so he\ncan\u2019t be a complete head case (MIT is\nalmost as good as Imperial right?).\nHis argument is based on the premise\nthat according to quantum mechanics,\nif anyone does observe an entropy-decreasing event, their memories of\nthe event \u201cwill be erased by necessity\u201d.\nYour memories will form and then\nbe subsequently erased. Witnessing\na system or process means you enter\ninto a \u201cquantum entanglement\u201d with\nit (there\u2019s scope for yet another dorky\nchat-up line here). In other words, you\nand the system are entangled and cannot truly be described independently.\nThe entanglement, according to our\namico Lorenzo, is between your memory and the system. The crucial step is\nthe removal of this entanglement, and\n\u201cthe disentangling operation will erase\nthis entanglement, namely the observer\u2019s memory\u201d.\nThis all sounds a bit like something\nMorpheus would say to Neo, before\nre-adjusting his ridiculous specs and\nscratching his ass. Nevertheless the\nthought experiment Maccone uses to\nelucidate his idea is fairly easy to understand (Medics...don\u2019t worry about it):\n\u2018An experimenter, Alice, measures\nthe spin state of an atom sent by her\nfriend Bob, who is otherwise isolated\nfrom Alice\u2019s laboratory. The atom is\nin a combined state (superposition)\nof spin-up and spin-down until Alice\nmeasures it as either up or down.\nFrom Alice\u2019s perspective, her lab gains\na single bit of information from outside,\nand it\u2019s then copied and recorded in her\nmemory and on her computer\u2019s hard\ndrive. That information flow from atom\nto lab increases entropy, according to\nAlice. Because Bob doesn\u2019t see the re-sult, from his perspective the spin state\nof the atom never resolves itself into up\nor down. Instead it becomes quantum\nmechanically correlated, or \u201centangled,\u201d\nwith the quantum state of the lab. He\nsees no information flow and no change\nin entropy.\nBob has total control of the quantum\nstate of her lab. To reduce the entropy\nof the lab from Alice\u2019s point-of-view,\nBob reverses the flow of that one bit of\ninformation by removing any record of\nthe atom\u2019s spin from Alice\u2019s hard drive\nand her brain. He does so by performing a complicated transformation that\ndisentangles the lab\u2019s quantum state\nfrom that of the atom.\nFrom Bob\u2019s perspective, the quantum information of the atom plus Alice\u2019s lab is the same whether or not the\ntwo are entangled \u2013 there is no change\nin entropy as viewed from the outside.\nSuch reversals could happen in real life\nbut because the Universe \u2013 like Alice \u2013\nwould retain no memory of them, they\nwould have no effect on how we perceive the world.\u2019\nYou might say that since this thought\nexperiment is attempting to portray\nMaccone\u2019s ideas as viable in the real\nworld, he\u2019s is doing himself no favours\nby pretending one of the physicists is\nactually a girl. Alice? More like Alan.\nEither way, my opinion is that his logic\nseems to hold. Whether it applies to our\nuniverse is incontestably another question altogether. But, like a cup of coffee\ngetting cold while you argue with the\nLibrary cafe staff about the necessity\nof a tray, or a pint glass shattering into\nhundreds of pieces due to reasons unrelated to Snakebite, it would be \u2018sickmansick\u2019 if these things did happen in\nreverse. And memories of events being\nerased by necessity, especially if that\nevent is Sports night, is something you\nare all familiar with.\nBioterrorism\nand Botox\nNathanLey\nNathanLey Science Editor\nI\nt\u2019s pretty much February now\nso understandably you may be\nreading this whilst depressed\nand/or fed up with life, especially in light of how much\nwork you claim to have to do. But\nyou should see it as a positive thing.\nIt's not unfair to say that the times\nwhere the going gets tough define\nour character. England cricket players\ndon't have their greatness measured\nby how many test match double centuries they pile up on a concrete road\nagainst Bangladesh, nor is a football\nteam\u2019s success for the year determined\nby how far they go in a domestic cup\ncompetition. Nope, nothing good\never came easily. So get your head\ndown, stick at it, and don't give up. If\nyou do bottle it, it says a lot about you.\nAnyway that was just a point I wanted\nto get across.\nTopically speaking, \"Bioterrorism\"\nwas an official line spouted by governments for a fair while, although\nit has died down recently (in light of,\nyou know, nuclear stuff). This is the\nthreat that we may all die at any given\nmoment as a result of terrorists using\ngerms or other biomaterial as weapons of mass destruction. To this day\nno such thing has quite materialised.\n2001 brought the US anthrax attacks,\nwherein letters containing anthrax\nspores were sent to various news of-fices, killing 5 people. But even this\nis considered by many to have been\nnothing other than an inside job, rather than the work of a terrorist threat.\nThis week, however, New Scientist\nreported on a new threat from none\nother than our favourite facial enhancer \u2013 Botox. It stands for the Botulinum toxin produced by Clostridium\nbacteria, and it is the most poisonous\nknown natural substance. It paralyses\nmuscles, and can kill you in minute\nquantities (80 mg). If carefully regulated between a few licensed companies\nit doesn\u2019t pose a threat to our safety,\nbut a cheap unlicensed version has allegedly been produced in Chechnya,\nan area frequently associated with\nMuslim extremism. Put two and two\ntogether, and we have the next episode in the story of \u201cBioterror\u201d.\nIn a tenuous but not totally unrelated link to this, the news came last\nweek that Heidi Montag recently underwent 10 plastic surgery treatments\n(including botox) within one day, at\nthe age of 23. On the one hand we\nhave here a sad story about an American celebrity that is totally insignifi-cant; on the other we have a remarkably dangerous precedent. Consider\nnot only the irreparable damage to\nher young body that she's inflicted,\nbut also the knock-on mental and social effects. You think she'll be happy\nwith these looks forever? Not likely.\nIt is just the thin end of the wedge, a\nwedge which commits her to a lifetime of regular cosmetic alterations.\nThe worst thing is that as these\nthings occur more frequently, they\u2019ll\nbecome seen as more acceptable,\nand will be catered for by a more accessible industry. How long until we\nreach a stage where it will no longer\nmatter if you are born with something\nyou don\u2019t like, because you can just\nchange it with a commercially available product? Before you dismiss\nthis idea, you cannot say that societies don\u2019t change and embrace liberal\nideas. You only need to look at the\nchange in public opinion on topics\nsuch as abortion, homosexuality and\nthe voting rights of women. Unlike in\nthese cases though, change will not\nbe for the better. These are worrying\ntimes for society, on one front more\nso than on the other.\nAmbidexterity linked\nto hyperactivity\nIn a talk entitled \u201cThe detection of extra-terrestrial\nlife and the consequences\nfor science and society\u201d, Dr\nFrank Drake has warned\nthat our technological development may hinder our\nprogress to find extra-ter-restrial life. During the analogue TV age, transmitters surrounded the Earth with a 50\nlight-year-wide \u2018shell\u2019 of radiation. The digital signals used to\ntransmit information now would be virtually indistinguishable from background level radiation.\nDr Drake of \u201cDrake Equation\u201d fame believes that there\ncould be up to 10,000 detectable civilisations within our\ngalaxy. However, 50 years of scanning the skies has failed to\nconfirm their existence.\nHidden by the digital\nrevolution\nA new study at Imperial College London has revealed that\nambidextrous children are\ntwice as likely to be hyperactive and struggle at school.\nDr Alina Rodreguez, who\nled the investigation, said that\n\u201cdifferencesinthebrainmight\nexplain these difficulties, but\nthere needs to be more research.\u201d Not only were the ambidextrous children found to be\nmore prone to learning difficulties such as ADHD, but the severity of any such condition was increased amongst this group.\nDr Rodriguez stressed however that the results \u201cshould not\nbe taken to mean that all children who are mixed-handed will\nhave problems at school.\u201d\nForgotten what happened last night? Now you know why\n\n"
