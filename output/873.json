    "content": "Gather ye round, good citizens, for the Phallix players present..\nThe Knights of Cheapsfc\nThe drums rolled, the trumpets sounded. Rave\nBeandick, accompanied by Charlie, the Cheapskate\nChaplain, made his way slowly to the chopping block.\nCharlie twirled his cane, and administered the last\nrites. Jolly Hockey Sticks stepped forward to proclaim\nthe charges.\n'Let it be known,' she cried,' that although I had\nnothing to do with this, de aries, it is my solemn duty\nto confront the accused with the charge of medium-to-high ish treason. Whereupon, the party of the first\npart being not party to the sherry party henceforth to\nbe known as the party of the second part, did\nknowingly and wilfully enter into hard labour upon the\ncitizens spit roast, hereafter to be known as the labour\nparty; and whereas the first party in conjunction with\nthe labour party was partly party to the second party's party, we find him guilty of attempted je no cide.'' I think that's pretty clear, de aries,' She smiled.\n'Well, partly,' said Beandick.\n'Hear, hear,' cried Dai Incompetent, who was\nwriting a treatise along similar lines.\n'Silence,' bellowed Fiona Knickerless, citizen's herald, 'Pray silence for the Lord High Executioner.'\nThe Lord High Executioner raised his chopper and\nprepared to chop.\n'Come on Beandick, give us some head,' shrieked\nBigun, Jolly Hockey-Sticks' lady in waiting/and she'd been waiting a bloody long time for this...\n'Listen,' said Beandick, 'I can do you a very good\ndeal on second hand choppers. I 'll throw in a couple\nof citizens' parchment pads for nothing. I won't even\ntake my cut.'\n'Not bloody likely,' groaned the Lord High\nExecutioner, expertly positioning his chopper for the\nfirst swing. Whack! The blade cut cleanly through.\nThere was a deathly silence.\n'Sherry anyone?' said Jolly Hockey-Sticks.\nSir Derek Dash was watching from high in Surefield\nFortress. His only thought was simple. T wish I had\na chopper that big,' he mused. Suddenly he realised\nhow pointless his wishes were, as Mad Dash entered.\nAh Mad Dash! What a princess she had been. How\nSir Derek regretted that fateful day, when he had first\nkissed her and she had promptly turned into a frog.\nOr was it a toad? He could never quite remember the\ndifference.\n'The meeting's about to start,' said Mad Dash. 'Sir\nFraser, Grand Financier, is already here, and trying to\nget his value for money. He's eaten an entire bowl of\npeanuts at the bar.'\nStop him,' shrieked Sir Derek,' that's the budget for\nthe citizens' dormitories, he's scoffing!'\nSir Fraser stalked in, 'Ok, so where's the new table\nI ordered?' he said.\n'It's in the bored room,' said Sir Derek. Sir Derek\nwas somewhat ashamed of his new table. Somehow,\n'The Knights of the Semicircular Table,' just didn't sound right. Cutbacks seemed to be everywhere\nnowadays. At least they could still afford to hold the\nannual Jousting Tournament organised by the\nbarbarians from the HUB. (Nobody knew much about\nthe people of the HUB, they came and went, but HUB\nwas forever.)\nThe Bored Meeting was due to start. The Knights\nof the Semicircular table had assembled to discuss the\npast year. Blancmange, the citizens' Bar Knight was\nthere, Neil McColostomy, the Cheap Knight Out was\ntoo. Prof Dicks, the Knight of the Long Knives was\nPage 24\nthere to represent the blood letters. Sir Charge of the\nAccommodation Office was standing in for the Knight\nof Passion and the Knight on the Tiles, who were both\nunavoidably detained. The Sleepless Knight had\ndropped off in the corner and the rather trendy Next\nKnight had still not turned up.\n'Let me take you back,' said Sir Derek,' to the start\nof the year '\nMcColostomy stepped into his new hut. Jolly\nHockey-Sticks was waiting for him with a pile of\nparchment-work. 'The job's quite easy, de a rie' she\nsaid, 'as long as you do as you're told, de a rie. We're\nhaving a sherry party to celebrate the new chief\ncitizens; you're invited. We're meeting in the inner\ntemple after lunch.'\nDai Incompetent woke up. The world was spinning\nround him. He felt Fairly III. 'Get off,' she screamed.\nIncompetent just grunted and staggered to his feet.\nIt was time for some incompetence.\nRave Beandick was waiting in the citizens' hut.\n'Where is Dai Incompetent?' he moaned. 'We've got\na meeting about the Citizens' Manuscript Store at\nmidday. We've still got ten copies of the dead sea\nscrolls to shift, and I haven't even started to sell the\nones signed by the author. After all that fuss over the\nlast batch of Turin shrouds in the citizens sporty store,\nI refuse to close this one as well. We are talking\ntakeover here, my son.'\nDai Incompetent stumbled in, swayed and rushed\nout again.\n'I give up!' said Beandick, holding his head in his\nhands.\nElsewhere, Rushed Clerk was talking to a citizen.\n'Of course, now, in the 16th century, there isn't much\ncall for accountants,' he was saying. 'I can, however,\noffer you something in a similar line. The pay's good\nand promotion is purely upon merit. There's a great\nfuture in clubbing old ladies over the head, and\nstealing their money. Banditry's a thriving profession,\nand you'll still be using all those skills you gained in\nyour course in rock smashing.'\nClerk's job was to find jobs for the useless, the\ngorm less and the jobless. It was tough work, but so\nfar he had resisted the temptation to invent\nmanagement consultancy. Times were hard. Sir Derek\nhad just decided to close the Jobbe Shoppe down. Sir\nDerek's Manuscript, Wetjerk, needed more gold, and\nthe fearsome creature from the HUB was demanding\nto be fed.\nThe citizens just didn't need proper jobs, thought\nSir Derek. He'd survived for years without one. Life,\nhe argued, was all about the basics: an apron, a liking\nfor running around with one trouser leg rolled up and\na silly handshake. If those young citizens didn't like\nit, well tough! There were plenty of jobs for\ndecorators; they could all go and do that instead.\nDecorators! Sir Derek thought back to his speech\nto the young citizens. He had given them a lesson in\npainting their cells. Magnolia went wonderfully with\nthe green mould.\nSuddenly the door slammed open. 'Sir Derek, Sir\nDerek, we regret to have to report an incident.' It was\nGaff Peeved, the captain of the guard.\n'It was a black man, I saw him,' murmured Merry\nTerry, his second in command. Merry Terry had spent\nmany years working for the metropolitan guards, and\nhe knew what a guilty black man looked like,\nespecially if he had an Irish accent. Merry Terry had\nspent his entire life trying to arrest a man called Nelson\nO 'Flynn. He hadn't actually done anything, but Merry\nwas pretty sure there was no smoke without fire. He\nknew, he smoked 30 cigarettes a day (quite an\nachievement, considering they hadn't even been\ninvented in the 16th century.)\n'We have reason to believe,' said Peeved, 'that the\naforementioned individual may have been relieving the\ncitizens of their goods.' Gaff paused to refresh his\nmemory from his notebook. 'I was proceeding in an\neasterly direction along the Surefield dirt track when\nI... sorry, wrong black man.'\nGaff resumed. 'The miscreant is believed to have\nfirst sneaked past our guards, by cunningly tricking\nthem into falling asleep. We believe the robbery took\nplace between 12 0,clock midday and 12 O 'clock\nmidnight. The thieving scoundrel was unable to steal\nanything more than the entire west wing, thanks to\nthe vigilance of our guards. We hope to have the r otter banged to rights soon. We'll catch him with the\ncement on his hands still, no doubt.'\n'Don't trouble me with such trivialities,' said the\nBaron, waving Gaff and Merry away. 'I must have\ntime to think.'\nSir Derek thought. He began to connive about the\njousting fields at Gravlington. The gold extraction had\nbeen going badly . All they'd found was sand, but that\nworked out bk, since Sir Fraser had managed to sell\nit to some arab friends at even Moor profit. The\nproblem was Sir Derek didn't know what to spend the\nmoney on; a new suit of armour; a new set of candles\nfor the banquet hall or a new dungeon for the citizens.\nMeanwhile in the Phallix Office, Smuggly was\ndrooling over some highly illuminated manuscripts.\n'Gadzooks,' he said 'look at the coffers on that!\nThey're as big as dinner plates.' Smuggly had decided\nto produce a special edition of Phallix, dealing with\nthe grubbier specimens of illuminated manuscripts. He\nhad sent out his menial, Dung Kink, to collect the\nfilthiest specimens he could find. Dung was\nparticularly pleased with the copy of Sub Constructus,\na manuscript for the jollier man. Dung felt that he had\ndone such a good job for Cheapskate, that he decided\nto stand for Chief Citizen, and walked outside to\nannounce the fact to his citizen friends.\nNo sooner had Dung walked out than Athens\nRitzBiscuit, the Witch Finder General, jumped out from\nbehind a bush. 'Witch,' he screamed inanely. 'The\nDevil's spawn.' He started to quote wildly from the\nbible. 'And the number of the beast shall be issue\n850,' he read. 'And it shall be printed in a faint hue\nof orange, so the Lord's children shall not see the sins,\nunless they look really, really closely.'\nSmuggly stormed out of the Phallix Office. 'Will you\nshut up,' he shouted, wiping the blood from his hands.\n'I 've scuffed the bloody pentagram, and the virgin's gone off.'\n'Get ye hence,' shrieked RitzBiscuit, rapidly marking\nout a cross upon his chest. 'I believe in God the single\nparent, the illegitimate son and the spooky ghost y.' RitzBiscuit had been working on the reformist bible.\n'Be gone,' boomed Smuggly, 'for I will conjure from\nthe depths of hell, the most hideous creature and he\nwill defeat you.' Smuggly clapped his hands. There\nwas a flash.\n'Bloody tubes,' moaned the creature as it stumbled\nfrom the smoke. It was Shan FareDodger, who had\njust finished writing another 'Deluder Column,' for\nPhallix.\nWhoosh! A great gust of wind blew RitzBiscuit\naway. 'Nice one,' said FareDodger, as the wind\ngripped him too. Smuggly was safely within his\nportable pentagram. A huge storm seized Cheapskate\nand tore the roof off. Three weeks later, Gaff Peeved\nnoted the whole affair and decided to send out a description of the offending black cloud.\nThe wind blew so hard it woke up the Baron, who\nhad been exhausted by the effort of all this\nreminiscing. 'That's all off the record, of course,' he\nsaid, certain that he had said something incriminating.\nThe Knights were all playing a game of cards in\nanother corner of the room. 'Black Jack!' shrieked Neil\nMcColostomy, the Cheap Knight Out.\n'Where'sthe knave?'screamed Peeved, rushing in...\nPage 25\n\n"

    "content": "In addition to the closure of most of the major fur\noutlets, a large number of small stores have fallen:\nSacks and Brendler in East Anglia (after 40 years),\nGlyn and Leinhart in Sheffield, and Faulkes Furs in\nBirmingham (after 62 years).\nThe reason for these massive closures: LYNX, the\nleading organisation against the fur trade. Their\nadvertising campaign has been strong and dramatic,\neven offensive, but this is exactly what the general\npublic is supposed to think. Posters appear in red and\nblack, to show the sick and bloody truth of the fur\ntrade. The once glamourous market is now dead.\nMany people reading this article will have seen\nLYNX'S famous 'Dumb Animals' commercial of the\nfashion show during which a fur coat disgorges blood\nover a horrified audience. This and all the other LYNX\nadvertising has made fur perhaps the most\ncontroversial and often debated animal welfare issue.\nRecent surveys by LYNX have shown that more than\n70% of the population are opposed to the killing of\nanimals simply for fur. LYNX'S campaign has an\ninternational reputation for its peaceful, non-violent\nwork for animals. It is actively campaigning within\nparliament to update laws that affect fur bearing\nanimals.\nThe Law is an ass! Why in this country, where we\nhave banned the use of the steel leg-hold trap, do we\nstill import fur from countries that are using this\nbarbaric device? In 1982, no fewer than 28,000 Lynx\nwere trapped for the fur trade in Canada alone. As the\nlarger cats are becoming scarce, the hunt turns its\nattention to the smaller species, the Ocelot, Margay,\nLynx, and Geoffroy's Cat. In 1984 the skins of more\nthan 13,000 Geoffroy's Cats were imported into\nFrance from Bolivia, while West Germany imported\n16,890 Leopard skins from China. Fortunately, West\nGermany has proposed protection for these smaller\ncats in the future.\nLast Summer, LYNX investigators visited the\nSwalesmoor Mink Factory just outside Halifax. They\ndiscovered appalling conditions and lax security. Dead\nMink were left lying in cages. The fur trade is trying\nto prevent such evidence from ever being revealed.\nThe LYNX investigators, along with key personnel\nhave now received writs of trespass. LYNX is being\nsued for financial damages, although no damage was\ndone to the property, and now faces substantial legal\ncosts. A report has been sent to the Ministry of\nAgriculture, who licence all mink factories in the U.K., and their response is awaited.\nIn North America, the Coyote, a wild creature, is\nhunted for its pelt. Bullets are not used to kill the\nanimals, because this damages the fur so there are\ntwo main practices of killing once the creature has\nbeen trapped: repeated bludgeoning of the head, and\na practice called 'suffocation', where the trapper\nstands on the animal's vital organs, usually for 14-15\nminutes, until the animal is dead.\nLast year alone, more than 300,000 coyotes were\namong the 20 million wild animals trapped for their\nfur. A full length coyote skin coat can be bought in\nLondon for between \u00a34,500 and \u00a37,000. Even in\nBritain, an estimated 100,000 red foxes are illegally\ntrapped or snared for their fur.\nPage 10\nTraps are indiscriminate. Swans, Deer and\ndomestic pets are regularly caught and\ndiscarded as 'trash' by the hunters. In\nAmerica, it was discovered that the traps\ncaught more than ten times as many\n'unwanted' animals and birds than they did\nCoyotes. These creatures included\nBobcats, Golden Eagles and Sheep. The\nsteel jaws used in these traps have been\ncondemned by American scientists and\nneurologists as 'primitive, un civilised and\ninflicting maximum pain.' Some animals\nhave been known to gnaw off their limbs in\nan attempt to escape.\n\n"

    "content": "Adam Tinworth looks at recent issues of some of London's student newspapers...\nHot off the presses or ju\nYou hold in your hands a student newspaper produced\nby a college devoted entirely to science subjects, none\nof which are terribly relevant to good journalistic skills.\nIn fact, a strict training for lab reports can make\nfeatures almost unreadable before editing. We are\nmembers of a larger institution, however, which\ncontains many colleges with literary based courses.\nSurely there should be some superb newspapers\nknocking about London..\nThe Cub\nSince the merger of Queen Mary's College with\nWestfield college, the local students' union has\nsuffered a number of problems. They have been\ntroubled with the merger of the two unions, and Cub,\ntheir newspaper, has been on the receiving end. Until\nrecently it was produced almost exclusively by union\nstaff and still remains a mouthpiece for union policy.\nIt has just been relaunched as 'The Cub', to coincide\nwith the official launch of the new college after over\ntwo terms of existence. The main changes have been\na reduction in page size from tabloid to A4, and the\ninclusion of the college logo as part of the masthead.\nIt's a pity they couldn't actually get the masthead\nstraight with the text.\nInside the content has changed little. The most\nnoticeable feature is the poetry corner. Perhaps the\nless said about this the better, but the A/ lay issue\nincludes a little gem called 'The girl in the lab',\ncontaining such lines as:\nHer head it was like a transformer in a way\nAnd her eyes like two helmholtz coils\nTheir news section also combines opinion with\nwhat starts off as a fairly standard news story and\noften degenerates into a rant from the writer's own\npolitical standpoint. The stories tend to revolve around\nexternal affairs which affect students (loans, poll tax,\netc.), while internal affairs are reduced to a small\nThe Cub\ncolumn, despite the fact that the news includes the\nrepossession of one of the union minibuses, the\nopening of new halls and on-campus drug problems.\nThe letters page is fairly active, revolving mainly\naround homosexuality and 'The Students' Union/Cub\nare crap' letters. Editorial replies can take up more\nspace than the letters themselves. In-jokes are out in\nPage 70\nforce, as are comments about the rugby club. The\nMusic page is quite impressive, managing to cover a fair range of both indie and mainstream music. The\nreviews page is pitiful, rarely progressing beyond a page, and consisting of such gripping items as the\nCollins Gem 'English Grammar'.\nThe problem page is somewhat of an oddity. It is\ndifficult to work out how serious it is meant to be. It\ncombines hack jokes aka broadsheet with apparently\nserious questions about sexually transmitted diseases.\nAll this said, Cub has shown a marked improvement\nover the year, and with another year's work, might\nactually get somewhere. At present it comes out\nevery three to four weeks, with around sixteen pages.\nDRAMSOCS FUTURE LOOKS BLEAK\nSPORTSCLUB S TO LOSE GYM PI\nPI\nUniversity College's student newspaper, PI, has a problem. UCL's proximity to ULU draws many of the\npeople who are interested in producing a student\nnewspaper into London Student. This year's PI is a case of resurrection. For much of the year nothing was\nproduced, at least nothing that came to the notice of\nthe students. Then a concerted effort was made to\nput together a new editorial team and start producing\nPI on a monthly basis.\nThe most noticeable feature of PI is that, although\nit is 20 pages long, it contains comparatively little.\nThis is mainly due to a large text size, and an\nexcessive amount of creative use of white space. It\nis divided into sections in a clear way. There is a fair\namount of news, usually consisting of two or three\nstories, with some comment and opinions to back the\nstory up. Not surprisingly, much of the recent news\nhas involved the loss of UCL union facilities. This\nbrings up the issue of distribution, as many UCL\nstudents in intercollegiate halls have learnt about the\nfacility loss through FELIX, rather than through their\nown paper. The reason for this is that PI is not\ndelivered to the departments, but has to be collected\nfrom the union building, an effort which most don't bother to make. This is a common problem among all\nstudent newspapers in London.\nThe letters page is filled with three short letters, one\nof which complains about the lack of a letters page,\nand an obvious space-filling cartoon of 'The Leaning\nMonk of Croydon'. Lucky UCL students get a free gift\nwith their paper-a Teenage Mutant Ninja Sabbaticals\nAirship! Just add a smoke filled condom (ribbed, of\ncourse).\nPI normally carries a reasonable selection of\nfeatures, with the May issue concentrating on NUS\nand student politics in general. May also sees an\ninterview with a Chem Eng student who runs discos\nat UCL and a piece about Ludovic Kennedy, who\ndelivered their Founder's Day Oration. Reviews\noccupy a page, covering two films and a play, while\nmusic coverage is almost non-existent. Three Society\nreports over two pages and a page filled with ten\nsmall ads complete the inside, while a small listings\npage on the back, much of which duplicates material\nin the regular 'Whats on at UCL' sheet, covers\nforthcoming Union and DramSoc activities.\nOh yes, they've got poetry as well-To The\nUnnamed Student...\n>\nt lukewarm?\n\"TUB i jji it Casey L Until recently, King's College, London (KCL, Casey\nL,ge dd it?) had a student newspaper which screamed\nDesk Top Publishing at you. They seemed incapable\nof using the same typeface for more than one article.\nThe result was frankly a mess. With the latest issue\nthough, there are definite signs of improvement.\nSomeone actually knows how to use their Mac these\ndays, it seems. It does bear more than a passing\nresemblance to PI though...\nAppearance aside, news gets a fair crack of the\nwhip, occupying the first few pages of the\nnewspaper, although again they are more\ninformation/opinion articles than pure news. Politics\nare the major theme, with NUS, ULU, loans and poll\ntax all discussed. The style can be a little unusual at\ntimes, with one report of a Kensington UGM written\nas something between a football report and superhero\ncomic. Features are a mixed bag; some are little more\nthan adverts for clubs while others make fairly\ninteresting reading, such as the inevitable exam hints\nand welfare special.\nAdverts are carried with two full pagers for local\neateries gracing issue eight. Reviews and music cover\nan average of two to three pages, with a reasonable\ncoverage of film and theatre, albeit somewhat\nselective. Music is covered across a good range.\nThe back page contains a listing of union bands and\nparties. Compared to most of the other papers their\nare surprisingly few space fillers, and a reasonable text\nsize has been used, giving a decent amount to read\nin each issue. Unfortunately, it's only monthly (if that)\nand can read like one big ents advert at times.\nNo poetry I'm afraid, but there is a delightful picture\nof the entire Taekwondo club.\nEgham Sun\nThe word 'order' is not one that you could easily\napply to Royal Holloway and Bedford New College's Student Union Newspaper, The Egham SUN {or NSU,\naccording to the level of toilet humour at the time).\nIt is difficult to work out exactly how they produce\nthis journal, but the text appears to be a mix of\ntypewritten and computer printed articles. Their basic\npolicy seems to be to take anything they're given and\nprint it, while filling the spare spaces with cartoons\nripped off from anything going.\nTo give a breakdown of standard contents would\nbe impossible, and so the best that can be done is to\nquote a couple of articles. RHBNC has just withdrawn\nfrom the NUS. The Egham Sun's coverage of this\nconsists of an article from the Secretary of the Labour\nClub telling them what a mistake they have made. In\nthe self same issue they cover the closure of the\nCollege Chemistry department with an article called\n'Chemistry Downer'-a short news style piece and aM EWS^.S A^S fc Casey L letter. It's good to see that RHBNC students are kept\nso well informed of crucial events around their college.\nMuch more importance is given to the first part of a romantic four part serial, 'Domestic Passion'. The\ngripping tale of Rafe and Clarissa is so much more\nimportant than the closure of an entire department,\nisn't it?\nThe only regular feature seems to be the two pages\nof music. These are actually painful to look at. With\na menagerie of small pieces, photos and reviews\nripped straight from music papers, it looks like it was\npasted up by a partially sighted, drunken idiot.\nThe Egham Sun is of indeterminate size and comes\nout at irregular intervals.\nLondon Student\nOtherwise known as the second newspaper of UCL,\nLondon Student comes out fortnightly and has a sabbatical editor. It is distributed to all the colleges\nof the University of London. IC's copies can be found\nin the Snack Bar if anyone is interested. London\nStudent is sited in the ULU building, next to UCL.\nPerhaps it's only claim to represent all the colleges of\nLondon is its proximity to the intercollegiate halls\nround Russell Square, otherwise it is staffed mainly\nby UCL students.\nPrinted in a tabloid format, London Student consists\nof 20 pages and is produced biweekly. London news\nspreads over the first three pages, followed by\nnational news and a news feature. Their news team\nseem to struggle somewhat with IC based articles,\nhaving cut one off in mid sentence and misspelt Tom\nYates as Tom Yeats. Written by an English student,\nfor whom it was more than his wordsworth, perhaps?\nThe centre pages are devoted to a listings section.\nThere doesn't seem to be any particular way of\nselecting the events that are included in this, a random\nselection of film, theatre, music and art have been\nused to fill the pages.\nThe back pages are devoted to sports reports,\nmaking it seem more like an imitation of a national\nnewspaper. These pages show an unhealthy\nobsession with reports from the London University\nSwimming Team-acronym LUST. Their Arts and\nMusic pages have more than a touch of PI about\nthem-minimum content in maximum space. This is\nmainly achieved through the use of huge photographs,\na trick which spreads into the features as well.\nMEW mm ON THE BLOCK Egham Sun\nIt seems strange that a science college should be\nproducing just about the best student newspaper in\nLondon. The only explanation that can be offered is\nthat students on relevant courses are too fed up with\ndoing their course work to indulge in the same thing\nin their free time. Is FELIX entirely staffed by\ndisaffected science students?\nPage 71\n\n"

    "content": "The Crucible\nArthur Miller's play The Crucible is a very good play.\nIt is also very difficult to stage well. There are certain\ncrucial scenes that would become laughable if not\nplayed by good actors. The National have not made\nthings any easier for themselves by staging it on the\nhuge, revolving Olivier stage, as it is a play that can\nwork best in a smaller, more claustrophobic\natmosphere.\nIt tells of the Witch hunts in Salem, Massachusetts\nin the year 1692. The accusations of a number of\nyoung girls caught dancing in the woods lead to the\nhanging of many of the townsfolk as the frenzy of the\npeople runs out of control. The play was written by\nMiller after his participation in the House Un-American\nActivities Committee hearings in the 1950's. The\nemotion he witnessed during the communist hunts\ngave him the inspiration for a play about witch hunts.\nAn emotional play it is indeed, leading us through\nsuperstition and fear in the human psyche as well as\na look at the nature of good and evil. It is a story of\na community not a small group of people, and so we\nhave more of an ensemble piece than a play which\ncan be carried by any one good actor. Although the\nstory of John Proctor provides the framework of the\nplay, his story becomes subsidiary to the greater\ntragedy of the community. The cast deliver. Individual\ncharacters are brought out well without any one\nstanding out from the rest and dominating the stage,\nallowing a real sense of community to develop.\nTheatre\nThey play out their tale against the background of\na set which increases with size. At the initiation of\nthe hunts the people are bigger than the scenery, but\nby the end they are dominated by the huge, imposing\ngallows structure, with a threatening noose hanging\nsilhouetted against the breaking dawn. In this way,\nthe increasing atmosphere of helplessness is\nconveyed as the hunts become bigger than any of the\npeople.\nAtmospheric, powerful, frightening, moving and\nmost of all enjoyable, the National have put on a superb production of a superb play. If you wish to see\nanything at the national at the moment, see this!\nThe Crucible is showing in the Royal National\nTheatre's Olivier Theatre on the South Bank. Student\nStandby's cost \u00a35.00.\nAdam T. Anna Christie\nTheatre Theatre\nThe first time that Greta Garbo spoke on the silver\nscreen was when she played the title role in the 1930\nversion of Anna Christie.\n'Gimmie avi sky ginger ale on the side, and don't be stingy baby' was the celebrated opener she\ndelivered in her seductive, guttural voice that assured\nher a triumphant passage from silent films to 'talkies'.\nThis latest stage production, set in-the-round at the\nYoung Vic, is a celebration of author Eugene O 'Neill's skill for painting a vivid picture of twenties New\nEngland. Anna Christie (Natasha Richardson),\nrelinquished by her father (John Woodvine) at the age\nof five to mid-western relatives, pays him a visit\nfifteen years later. She, sick of a being 'abused' by\nmen shelters with him on his barge and immediately\nfalls in love with the sea and then with a seaman. He\nhowever, is deeply fearful and distrustful of the\noceans, having lost most of his family at sea, and is\ngiven to frequently cursing 'that 'ole devil sea'\nwhenever fate intervenes in his simple existence.\nO 'Neill's characters' naturalistic in art i cula cie s give rise\nto a large amount of melodrama especially in the\nsecond half when Anna, her father and her lover\nstruggle to voice their real feelings.\nAlthough the melodrama can induce spurts of\nembarrassed laughter from members of the audience,\nthe overall effect is one of humanity and social\nrealism, making the fatalistic conclusion entirely\nbelievable. Natasha Richardson [A Month in the\nCountry, Gothic) sporting a flawless Brooklyn accent\nturns in a strong performance and John Woodvine\n(You'll recognise him when you see him) is superb as\nAnna's colourful and idiosyncratic father. Incidentally,\nthe programme is one of the most interesting I 've read\nin a long time, darlings.\nAdrian Pagan,\nThe Illusion\nCrucial to good theatre is the ability to draw audiences\ninto the play in such a way that they forget that they\nare watching actors on a stage. This, like all rules, can\nbe broken. Temptation made the auditorium and the\nstage one, to apply its message to us. The Illusion\nmakes no attempt whatsoever to make us forget we\nare in the theatre. From the moment the curtain rises\nto a rather primitive, if amusing, puppet show, to the\nclosing moments when the backstage is revealed one\nis constantly reminded that one is sitting in The Old\nVic, London.\nThe main part of the play is an illusion, shown by\na mage to a traveller to tell of the life of an errant son,\ndriven away by his father's callousness. At intervals\nthroughout the play these two crop up again and\nagain, sitting in some fake stalls, peering through the\nroof of a mock up Old Vic. The illusions themselves\nare overplayed caricatures. There are no props, the\nactors merely miming to the appropriate sound\neffects, all played for comic effect.\nThe thrust of the plot is a simple tale of love and\njealousy, of crime and escape. The character is at ions of the sexes are very similar to the other play of\nCorneille that has been performed at The Old Vic, The\nLiar (FELIX 854), with the cheating and hypocritical\nmen, and the more idealistic women.\nThis, though, is largely irrelevant to the overall\nmeaning of the play. The is about theatre and\ntheatrical s. It is about and by Playwrights and actors.\nSomewhat incestuous perhaps, but enjoyable none\nthe less. In fact, to coin a phrase, darlings, marvellous\njust wasn't the word! A treat for the s bian s and\ntheatre-lovers everywhere.\nThe Illusion is showing at the Old Vic, Waterloo\nRoad, SE1. The Box-Office is on 071-928-7616.\nAdam T. Page 21\n\n"

    "content": "An old story of what can happen is that of the sea\notter, hunted and killed for its very smooth fur. It has\nbeen said that there are approximately 800 million\nhairs in each pelt. Its troubles were at a peak when\nthe Chinese Mandarins were introduced to this richest\nof pelts by Russian hunters. This led to entire herds\nbeing wiped out, the population of Otters falling from\n150,000 in 1740 to just over 1000 in 1911. A treaty\nwas then signed by representatives from the United\nStates, Great Britain (for Canada), Russia, and Japan.\nThe Otters were given complete protection, and\nthankfully, their numbers have now recovered\nsomewhat. Sadly, it now faces other threats from\nentanglement in fishermen's nets, and oil spills.\nLYNX is even opposing the wearing of fake fur,\nsaying that glamour ising fur in any way is wrong.\nTheir attitude is that furs are beautiful-but only on\ntheir rightful owners, the fur- bearing animals. After\nhigh-lighting the fact that OXFAM had been selling\nsecond hand furs, LYNX has persuaded them not to\naccept donations of fur, and all stocks of fur were\nwithdrawn on March 1st this year.\nMany of those women who own a fur coat, now\nrefuse to wear them. Models are paid extra for the\nsocial stigma of wearing Mink coats, and many refuse\neven to wear one. This effect is not international as\nyet, and only The Netherlands has been affected as\nmuch as Britain, although fur is at last struggling to\nstay in fashion in the United States, which accounts\nfor about a third of the $6 Billion market. LYNX has\nopened an office in Los Angeles, and is planning to\nstart a similar publicity campaign in Western Europe,\nusing its 'Rich Bitch. Poor Bitch' posters.\nIn Kenya, hundreds of thousands of pounds of illegal\nwildlife products are being destroyed. Recently, a bonfire was lit to destroy over three tons of ivory,\nwhilst in Brazil, thousands of furs from illegally killed\nendangered species were incinerated. This removes\nthe items from circulation, with the view that the\nitems have no monetary value anyway. LYNX will be\nholding its own ceremonial bonfire of fur coats later\nin the year.\n' < \u2022 : h. If you don'tw; and killed in Ii-L' hoh traps\nI!11!on* don't animal\na fur\ntori iii ee. LYNX Among the anti-fur trade's supporters are Paul &\nLinda McCartney, Richard Adams, Richard Briers, Liza\nMinnelli, Elton John, Kate O 'Mara, David Bailey, Neil\nKinnock, David Owen, Hayley Mills, Andrew Bowden\nMP, Ron Davies MP, Tony Banks MP, The Princess\nCatherine Aga Khan, Richard Ryder, Phil Cool, Big Fun,\nand the Bishops of Salisbury, Edinburgh and Bangor.\nSeveral Lord Mayors have expressed support for the\nending of the use of fur on ceremonial robes. These\ninclude the Mayors from Birmingham, Bristol,\nManchester, Bradford, Cardiff, Swansea, and the Lord\nProvost of Inverclyde.\nIf you would like to become a member of LYNX and\nsupport the campaign to end the cruelties of the fur\ntrade, please contact LYNX for further details, by\nwriting to : LYNX, P.O.

This feature is\nonly concerned with the hall. The nearest tube is\nBarbican or Moorgate-leave a good three quarters of\nan hour to get there from South Kensington. Ticket\noffice 938 8891. Student standbys are reduced price\ntickets sold less than an hour before the performance\nand conform to the same free-market criteria as for\nthe South Bank Centre. Prices range from \u00a34 to \u00a37.\nThe hall is as large as the Royal Festival Hall, but\nis much more pleasant as it is made of pine wood with\nranks of comfortable and convenient benches rather\nthan seats. Once again, interval coffee can burn a hole\nin your pocket.\nThe Royal College of Music in Prince consort road-between Aeronautics and the Mines building, the tall\nred brick building out of Transylvania. It puts on free\nconcerts virtually every night in term time, and\nsometimes puts on operas of a high standard, which\ncost less than \u00a35 to see.\nThe quality is good-with occ a is ional errors (the\nperformers are students). The music ranges from the\ngood old fashioned classics to modern stuff like\nWebern, Schoenberg and Reich. Term programmes\nare available from the RCM reception desk.\nImperial College occasionally puts on free lunch\nhour concerts by professional and often world famous\nmusicians. These are held in the Read theatre at 1.30\non Thursdays, except when the Humanities\ndepartment changes it without advertising the fact.\nTerm programmes are dotted about the college, or\ncontact the humanities department (Telephone\ninternal 7059).\nCovent Garden Opera House in Covent Gardennearest tube of the same name. Ticket office 240\n1066/1911, or recorded standby information on 836\n6903. This puts on a variety of extremely expensive\noperas and ballets. The so-called 'low price standby'\nis \u00a310. But it is possible to get restricted view seating\nfor \u00a31 to \u00a3 4 - you see the occasional flash of a tutu\nand thats it. I don't much like opera or ballet, so that's all this place gets.\nThe Royal Academy of Music in Marylebone Road,\nnearest tube is Regents park. Free concerts are held\nby students on a fairly regular basis during term time.\nLeave in plenty of time to buy a ticket; all student\nstandbys are sold to the student in person just before\nthe performance on production of a valid student\nunion card.\nSt John's, Smith Square-the nearest tube is\nWestminster and involves a10 minute walk. The bus\nservice stops closer but tends to be very irregular. It\nis quite cheap with concessions costing from \u00a32 to\n\u00a35.\nIt is another beautiful 18th century church rebuilt\nafter the war. A good setting for all music from the\nchamber to the grand, and has concerts virtually every\nevening.\nSt John's, Smith Square\nPage 53\n\n"

    "content": "Catch Me...If You Can\nIf your school were about to close, would you fight\nto save it? Well neither would all but one student at\nSt Cloud's Cathedral High. Melissa the school\npresident is trying to raise the $200,000 required to\nsave the school by selling apple pies and raffle tickets.\nThe situation seems hopeless until the school rebel,\nDylan Malone, offers to raise the money by gambling\nit on illegal car races.\nHere come one of the many improbable twists in\na very dreamy story. The racer they are going to bet\non is none other than Dylan himself. From here on the\nstory follows the typical story line of success followed\nby failure and finally triumphing against all the odds.\nIn addition, the nerd is particularly well played, being\na bit different from most nerds that you may have\nseen. He is the stereotypical nerd to all appearances,\nbut manages to add a little extra to the part in terms\nof character.\nH.G. Wells has a lot to answer for!\nLight-years away the Martians, three foot tall with\nheads that bulge like a huge zit on their heads, are\nattacking a planetary system and things are not going\nwell. One ship is lost and wanders into the vicinity of\nEarth which happens to be broadcasting 'War of the\nWorlds', thirty years after the original hoax. They\nmistake this for a real invasion and so rush in to help\nwith the wondrous victory.\nThey pick their night well, for it is Halloween, the\nnight of ghosts, goblins and Martians. Being mistaken\nfor out-of-town kids, they are prevented from blowing\nup their first target (a house) by being taken on a trick-or-treat ride by a woman who grabs them by antennae\nthat look remarkably like wooden spoons.\nBut all is not well in the little town of Big Been, Illinois.\nThe farmers collective, now owned by a group of\nmean businessmen who want to take advantage of\nthe new off-ramp, are repossessing all the farmers'\nland. One of the farmers tries to take advantage of\nthe aliens landing to take pictures, hoping to sell them\nand so save his farm.\nThere then follows a story of mistaken identities and\nNotebook\nWhatever impression you may get from the title of this\nfilm\u2014it's wrong.\nDespite its generalised title, Notebook on Cities and\nClothes is basically a documentary about Johju\nYamamoto-his life and opinions and much of the film\ncentres around a fashion show he is putting on. (Just\nfor those of you who don't know Yohju Yamamoto\nis a Japanese fashion designer.)\nThe first couple of minutes of the film are quite\ninteresting-a voice philo soph ising about the word\n'identity' (a concept which fails totally to be\ndeveloped during the course of the film), but that's about as far as it goes. The rest of the film is taken\nup with Yamamoto's feelings on people and cities and\nhis life and work.\nThe fact that Wim Wenders (the director) was asked\nto do this film by the Georges Pompidou Arts Centre\nshould really be enough to scare you off. He was\npretty sceptical about the idea at first-with good\nreason-it's a pity he did agree to do the film.\nPage 18\nfumbling attempts by the Martians to destroy vital\nEarth installations. The action comes thick and fast,\nas does the humour, produce ing responses ranging\nfrom chuckles to bounding hysterics form the\naudience.\nPerhaps the best example of both is when they try\nto destroy a silo using their heat ray. Little do they\nknow that it's a silo for corn, not missiles. As it\nwarms-up they notice a strange rumbling noise and\ntoo late they switch the ray off. With a mighty roar\nthe top blows off and out pours a mountain of\npopcorn, very appropriate for a cinema. Lying under\ntonnes of popcorn one of them discovers that you can\neat it and when another asks how they are going to\nget out you hear a munching noise as they tunnel\nthrough.\nThe costumes and effects are very well done, the\nMartians faces are cute with little stubby noses and\nshiny eyes, the lips did have a nasty habit of not\nmatching what they were saying, a bit like a spaghetti\nwestern. Most of the space scenes were the classic\nconvoy set-up but at last they have used models that\nresemble something conceivable, not the impossible\noil Cities\nThe race scenes, that take up about half of the film\nare reasonably well filmed, with some nice camera\nangles and the action is well portrayed without being\nover dramatic.\nDylan is a very self confident character and his\nswaggering gait is often comical, although I expect\nit was not meant to be. If you have a teenage sister\nshe may well come out with a slight crush, but don't let her hopes get too high as I am afraid he is married.\nThere is a fantastic al twist in the tail of the film. Not\nwanting to ruin the film, I won't divulge it, but I will\nsay that it involves the school principle and fast cars.\nOverall I feel that the film is aimed at a slightly\nyounger market, which it's PG rating suggests. So if\nyou have a young teenage brother or sister then\nrecommend it to them, but stay clear yourself.\nIan Hodge.\nFilm\ncontortion that they often use.\nIt must be very hard to decide how to portray aliens\nbut in this case they have decided to give them human\npersonalities, the flash cool lieutenant and the brainy\nscientist (complete with German accent!) are the best\nof the bunch. As for the humans, they produce\npassable performances with the not i ble exception of\nthe young daughter of the sheriff. She has a wonderful\nface and the expression as she says goodbye to the\naliens and their metallic cat are very convincing.\nSuspense is maintained by the Enforcer Drone that\nis trying to kill them for being failures. It chases them\naround, seeking them out, shooting at them and being\ngenerally very unfriendly.\nIt's very enjoyable and well worth seeing, although\nyou may have to use the excuse that you are taking\nyou kid brother or sister, just to keep up the pretense\nthat you're an adult.\nThe best part for me was the ending. All I 'll say is\nthat horse dung is NOT the best fertiliser in the\nUniverse.\nIan Hodge.\nFilm\n& Clothes\nA large part of it was filmed with a video camera\nwhich means the picture quality is rather poor-low\nresolution especially when projected onto a large\ncinema screen. In fact the film in general fails to\nexploit any of the advantages of the big screen-it\nwould have probably been better as a TV\ndocumentary-always supposing you were interested\nin the subject.\nWenders is exceedingly fond of imagery-he refers\nto Yamamoto's team of workers as 'guardian angels'\nand the theme of a small TV is recurrent throughout\nthe film.\nIf you know of Yamamoto and are interested in his\nopinions and neuroses then maybe this film is for\nyou-otherwise forget it. The film totally fails to\ncapture the attention; after half an hour I was\nwatching the clock. It may cater for a small specialised\naudience but as a film for the entertainment of the\ngeneral public it is a complete failure.\nJ L Wright.\nSpaced Invaders\n\n"

Where possible films are followed by their certificate and books by their author\nare no comments for the theatre listing as most of the shows will have closed by now, save a few Na\nTheatre, RSC and West End productions.\nFilms\n845 The Abyss (?)\nCross between Alien, The Poseidon Adventure and\nClose Encounters of the Third Kind. Better qualities:\nit was expensive, the plot is O.T.T.. If you ignore the\nincongruities the action never dulls.\n851 Back To the Future II (PG)\nThe classy time travelling DeLorean returns in a complex time jump plot. Light hearted in the future,\ndark in an alternative 1985. Not intellectually\nchallenging but who cares? A worthy sequel.\n842 Bad Taste (?)\nAliens invade seaside town to use inhabitants as\nhamburger meat. Bad Taste is a bit of a laugh with\nample chance for the squeamish to wriggle. Is there\na market for such bland films?\n866 Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure (PG)\nTwo young idiots travel through time to pass their\nhistory exam and found the rock group of tomorrow.\nMost of it is funny and effects are pretty good for a mickey-take of teen adventures.\n855 Black Rain (18)\nManhattan cop chases Yakuza thugs in Japan. Plenty\nof action while cop steps on police force's toes. Lone\ngunfighter ending. Some violent scenes, but mostly\na mainstream thriller not to be missed.\n865 Black Rain (?)\nChronicles the life of a family in Hiroshima after the\nbomb and how the survivors cope with the memory.\nMarvelous attention to detail, b/ w images of death\nand a strong ending with great impact.\n858 Blaze (15)\nRomance of stripper with governor as a historical\ndrama (slightly simplified for the film). Colourful\nbackground for the statesmen's machinations with\ngreat costumes. Not too taxing but enjoyable.\nVietnam vet returns wounded to a country that feels\nsorry not proud. Outshines other 'Nam films with\nrealistic locations and imaginative photography. Tom\nCruse is utterly convincing and is worth seeing.\n856 Casualties of War (18)\nVietnam. Young girl is raped, soldier sets on quest for\njustice. Mostly predictable characters though tension\nmounts nicely but let down by set pieces. Serious flaw\nin relegating rape to the sidelines.\n853 The Chocolate War (?)\nCatholic Boys' school needs funds so sells chocolate!\nPower, avarice and sheer malevolence follow in a study of dictatorship in miniature. Very emotive with\nexcellent music and performances.\n846/853 Cook, Thief, His Wife & Her Lover (18)\nPeter Greenaway's themes of death, decay and\ncorruption combine with food and sex and a simple,\nsurreal, plot to bombard the senses. Extreme brutality\nbut not misplaced. Highly disturbing.\n842 Cousins (?)\nAmericanised version of French film Cousin, Cousine.\nTwo married couples have adult u rous affairs in a 'romantic comedy'. Laughs are quite thin on the\nground in a celluloid 'Mills and Boon'.\n872 Creator (15)\nPeter O 'Toole tries to clone his dead wife in back yard\nwhilst pursued by nymphomaniac 19 year old. Full of\npathetic sentimental ising, neck licking and ear\nsucking. Perfect for IC students.\n862 Dad (PG)\nMother falls ill, son flies in to restore father's health\nthen Dad too falls ill. A mix of comedy and drama that\ncan get too sentimental at times. A bad script\nmeanders aimlessly. Nice try.\n852 Dead Calm (15)\nSex, violence and a happy ending in a glorified chase\non the open waves when a couple stumble upon a psychopathic killer. The acting is good, the directing\nprecise but don't rush to see it.\n853 The Dream Team (15)\nFour inmates run amok in the city whilst their doctor\nis in hospital being hunted by bent cops. Their\ndisabilities are not funny but the humour is natural.\nA good comedy, worth seeing.\n860 Driving Miss Daisy (U) Black chauffeur is taken on after lady crashes her car.\nSlowly she accepts him and friendship develops.\nGentle and delightfully funny amble though 25 years\nof social change with clever period touches.\n855 A Dry White Season (15)\nRacism and justice in Johannesburg studied through\ntwo families. Stunning realism shows strength of the\nblack people against terrible adversity. Noteworthy\nperformances. A moving film leaving us with hope.\n854 Earth Girls Are Easy (PG)\nAliens crash in a pool, act like multi coloured gorillas,\ncut their hair and fall in love with girl. Hackneyed plot\nwith wasted potential except for some interesting\ndetails. A formula film rather than SF.\n865 The Fabulous Baker Boys (15)\nA duet needs something more, so a female singer is\ntaken on. She re vital is es the act, then a relationship\ndevelops. Little plot, ambles pointlessly and\ninconclusive.\n858 Family Business (15)\nExploration of Father-Son relationship when son gets\ncaught after returning to crime. Some touching scenes\nbut relies on the stars too much. Comedy, drama or\ntear-jerk er? Enjoyable but misses the boat.\n842 The Fly II (18)\nSequel to remake of 'B' flick where man/fly mutation\npasses on altered genes to son. 'Snuff movie' type\nspecial effects leading to a predictable ending. Sick\nbags useful.\n852 Ghostbusters II (PG)\nThe team form up again to rid the city of a river of\nsupernatural slime. The effects are good (although a slight lack of ghosts) with funny one- liners. Less plot\nthan Ghostbusters I but still enjoyable.\nPage 59\n\n"

    "content": "100 YEARS AGO\n\u2022\nAt ermita rium, rising out of the ground like ruins of some ancient building.\nother debris. Like the term it a rium it contains many\nliving areas, larders and corridors.\nNot all nests are ground based. For instance, the\nIndian ant, Oecophylla sm arag dina, builds nests in\ntrees. A brigade of worker ants pulls the edges of two\nleaves together in order to 'sew' them into a sheet.\nWhere the gap between leaves is wide, the ants form\nchains, holding onto each others legs! The thread is\nproduced from a grub, held in the mouth of another\nant. The grub produces a silk thread from its lower\nlip and this is criss-crossed between the leaves to sew\nthem together. Eventually, enough silk is present to\nform a solid joint.\nBees\nThe bee is a well known social insect, whose colonies\noften contain 60-80,000 individuals. Wild bees\nfrequently live in a hive, hanging from the branch of\na tree. The hive is composed of hexagonal cells in\ncombs. The size of the cells varies between species\nand can be specialised for certain uses. The bigger\ncells are often used for the rearing of drones and the\nlargest are usually reserved for queen bees. Some\nspecies prefer a more out of the way habitat such as\ncaves or hollow trees.\nCrabs\nThe tiny, pink-bodied pea crab lives inside the\nCommon mussel and grabs its food from the mussel's gills while the aptly named Hermit crab supplements\nits own skeleton with empty sea snail and whelk\nshells. Nereid worms, which are a type of rag worm, often live with the Hermit crab for protection.\nThe Human home\nNot all arthropods live in remote or secluded places\nlike rain forests or damp cellars. The human body is\nhome to many, otherwise homeless, creatures. There\nare often over 2000 mites on one human being, not\nthat this is something to worry about. Eyelash mites,\nwhich spend their days, as their name suggests, in\nthe roots of eyelashes, help to keep the lashes clean.\nThere are other mites living in hair follicles all over the\nbody. Some mites have strong anchorage spikes on\ntheir feet and powerful jaws to allow them to feed on\nsoft human skin, often a cause of itching.\nOn a larger scale, are the blood sucking insects. The\nTsetse fly grips onto a suitable blood donor, inserts\na tube known as the proboscis and feeds until its body\nis so distended that it can drink no more.\nMore revolting still is the habitat of the human blood\nfluke. At the larval stage it leaves its first home, the\nwater snail, and remains in water until it penetrates\nthe human skin. The fluke works its way into the blood\nvessels and grows in the veins. It lays eggs that have\na sharp single spine, which permeate to the bladder\nand are passed out. In some cases the eggs may\ncause damage by trying to tunnel their way out\nthrough the bladder wail.\nIn the home, huge armies of creatures, which look\nferocious under the microscope, live in beds, furniture,\ncarpets and curtains. The book louse, probably a distant relative of that well known animal the\nbookworm, lives on the mould that grows on damp\nbooks. It belongs to a group of over 1000 species,\nthe majority of which are winged, living in forest and\nwoodland on a diet of leaves and bark.\nThe homes of the arthropods are tremendously\nvaried. Their ingenuity is often awe inspiring and a result of many years of evolution and adaptation.\nMaybe man could learn something from these so\ncalled 'creepy crawlies.'\n\u2022 Next Friday will see the lighting of the Natural\nHistory Museum with the use of electricity. The\nscheduled function is that of the Society of Arts and\nit will allow the authorities to test the effectiveness\nof electric lighting in the building. If successful, the\nlighting seems likely to be made permanent. At the\nBritish Museum, where electricity is already used,\nmembers of the public have to be excluded for an\ninterval at dusk, so that the lamps can be lit. This has\nnot been successful, since the practice has started to\ndiscourage visitors.\n\u2022 'Is there coal in the south-east of England?' is\nthe title of a lecture to be given next week at Mansion\nHouse by Professor T McKenny Hughes FRS. It will\nbe presided over by the Lord Mayor and supported by\nthe 'Coal Search Committee'. The Committee\nconsists of scientific and commercial men, donating\ntheir services free of charge. It was formed with the\naim of locating and finding the extent of coal fields\nin the south-east.\n\u2022 Paris is to have its own University, it was agreed\nlast week. The General Council of the Paris Faculties\nheld a meeting at the Sarborne and decided the\nUniversity should have five faculties (Protestant\nTheology, Law, Medicine, Science and Literature)\nwith an upper school of Pharmacy. Besides\nprofessional degrees, the University will grant\ndiplomas of purely scientific studies to native and\nforeign students.\n\u2022 One million square miles of Canada is still\nunexplored, estimates Dr GM Dawson in a paper just\npublished. The area represents between one third and\none quarter of Canadian territory.

    "content": "Thinking of getting a computer to help you? It may create more problems than it solves. Liz\nWarren explains why 'information systems' are a minefield for the unwary.\nThe Dream Machine?\nThe term 'Information System' can equally be applied\nto a humble card index as to a multi million pound IBM\nmainframe running sophisticated software. But the\nlast thirty years have seen unprecedented growth and\nincreased complexity in the area of 'information\nsystems', from the punched card systems of the\nfifties to the 'fifth generation' languages and 'artificial\nintelligence' of the late eighties. At the same time,\nthere has been a revolution in the general level of\n'computer literacy' fuelled by the advent of the home\ncomputer and pledges by certain companies\n(promoted by certain computer manufacturers, who\nmight be described as having an interest) to have 'one\nper desk'. Everybody can believe they are a computer\nexpert. Or can they?\nWith the advent of more sophisticated 'information\nsystems' has come an increase in incomprehensible\njargon. The non-specialist is left fumbling with MIPS\n(million instructions per second), EPROM (Erasable\nProgrammable Read Only Memory) and CASE\n(Computer Aided Software Engineering). The non-specialist is usually the person, such as the\ndepartmental manager, who is responsible for\nacquiring the 'information system', whether it be an\naccounts package or an ordering system. The rise of\njargon, and the lack of explanation by those who\nunderstand the jargon to those who do not, can be\na major stumbling block in the choice and\nimplementation of the 'right' information system.\nWithout the 'right' choice, the system is bound to fail\nto some degree.\nThe jargon and mysticism of the experts has led\npeople to over-estimate the potential of a new\n'Information System'. Managers frequently expect, or\nare led to believe by computer specialists and\nconsultants, that the 'white heat of technology' will\nnot only solve their current data processing problems,\nbut also, in some mysterious way enhance and\nimprove their whole working lives. One senses they\nare sold it with some vague promise that the system\nwill generate orders in a stagnant market, solve all\ntheir staff disputes and even make a jolly nice cup of\ntea! Given that only rarely is a totally appropriate\nsystem installed, managers feel even more\ndisillusioned because the system has not lived up to\ntheir unrealistic and inflated expectations.\nWhy do systems not live up to those expectations?\nA prime reason is that the system simply does not do\nwhat it is supposed to do. This may seem subtle, for\nexample an accounts package does not produce a desired report: it may be possible, with the\nexpenditure of yet more money, to 'fix' the problem\nby paying someone to add another program. (This is\nevidence of an organised mafia amongst computer\nprogrammers to build in 'bugs' so that they or their\ncolleagues can be kept in work sorting them out.) This\nsort of inability to provide the information required by\nmanagement to help it take decisions is actually a major failing by the system, since this providing such\nsupport is one of its main roles.\nAlternatively, the system may be completely\nunsuitable, in scale or methods, for the task in hand.\nWhere one company installed a complicated\nautomatic cheque generation system which produced\nabout four hundred cheques a month, another\ncompany, which produced that many cheques in a Page 74\nweek, could operate far more efficiently using a manual system.\nA system may also be suitable for the short term\nneeds of the company, but unable to cope with long\nterm development plans, which may produce more\ndata than the system is capable of handling. One\ncompany originally had a stock control system for\nabout 100 different types of stock. When they\nexpanded, this increased to about 2000 different\ntypes of stock. The system which had worked well\nwhen handing small numbers simply clogged up and\nbecame unwieldy when faced with the much larger\nnumber.\nSo, why are systems often so wide of the mark?\nThis is mainly due to a lack of information and\ncommunication, ironic in an industry so obsessed with\nthe processing of information and data. The system\nmay have been incorrectly specified, perhaps because\nthe people requesting the system did not fully\nunderstand their current system and their future\nneeds, or perhaps because the analysts from the\nsystem suppliers did not understand the explanations\nof their clients. (Believe me, it's quite possible for\nanalysts, when faced with a simple procedure for\ndeducting 10% of an invoice to be paid at a later date\n- quite common practice in engineering firms - to turn\nthis into a system which added 10% to every invoice.\nI 've seen it done by a 'reputable' software house who\nwere official agents for IBM.) Although the analysis\nof requirements is frequently seen as very expensive,\nespecially as part of a 'preliminary' study, money\nspent here is usually well invested and can help to\navoid major problems arising later.\nAnother reason for failure is the 'gadget' attraction\nthat specialists can imbue systems with: 'For only a little more money, it can do this, this and this,' they\nmay declare, impressing their client with technology\nwhich may be irrelevant or, even worse, actually\ndamaging to the way the client wishes to work.\nFinally, there is a large market for 'off the peg'\nsystems, or 'packages'. While some packages are\nexcellent and live up to their advertising puff, many\nare written to suit everybody and frequently suit\nnobody.\nEven assuming that the system has successfully\navoided the pitfalls described above, it is likely that\nit has not been considered in the wider context of the\norganisations overall information systems needs. An\nexample is the engineering company which had\nrecently acquired an IBM mainframe for its accounts\nand costing system. The department responsible for\ntendering for contracts was at the same time installing\na computerised version of its tendering system, based\non IBM Personal Computers. When the company won\na contract, the tender became the budget for the\ncontract and was transferred to the accounts costing\npackage. To do this the data had to be re-entered by\nhand onto the accounts mainframe. Both systems\nwere excellent in their way, but completely\nincompatible. The data even had to be recoded\nbecause the two departments used different codes for\neach part. No-one had considered that the large\ninvestment in both systems should be coordinated to\nensure that they worked harmoniously.\nThe investment in and 'return' from systems is\nanother area where systems are frequently\ndisappointing. A study by TRW, one of the leading\nsoftware contractors in the US, has shown that initial\nestimate for the cost of a system can be anywhere\nbetween a quarter and four times the actual cost.\nWhile you may be happy if your system costs one\nquarter of what you expected, you are not likely to\nbe very leased if it takes four times as much to make\nit even do part of what you wanted. The reasons for\nthis uncertainty lie in the very nature of software:\nwithout a specific knowledge of the system\nunavailable before the system is almost fully\ndeveloped, the cost of, for example, programming,\ncan only be guessed.\nEfforts can be made to improve the estimate of\ncosts, using for example 'software metrics' which\nmeasure either a characteristic of the software, such\nas the estimated number of lines of code, or\nsomething about the software production, such as the\nnumber of man hours used in a certain phase of the\ndevelopment of the system. From these\nmeasurements and estimates, forecasts about the\nsystem can be made which may be more accurate\nthan simple guesswork. However large scale\ncomputer systems are still characterised by overruns\non costs and late deliveries.\nAnother popular misconception is that by spending\nmoney on information systems, companies can save\nmoney. Suppliers, obviously interested in selling their\nproducts, will make claims for 'increased productivity'\nor 'throughput' which can be totally unfounded.\nManagement consultants Price Waterhouse have\nindicted that 'cost justification studies with the\nsupplier aren't really worth the paper they ar written\non. It's in the interests of the supplier to make the\nfigures look good'.\nA forgotten aspect in many information systems\nwhen they are being designed is the needs of the end\nusers. The VDU operators who have to input the raw\ndata seemed to be consulted rarely during the planning\nand specification stage. They often find the new\nsystem inflexible, awkward and irritating. They may\nfind it difficult and bewildering to use. Retraining is\noften neglected and poorly trained staff who do not\nunderstand the system properly are likely to be a major\ncause of machine failure - simply through pressing the\nwrong key at the wrong time. Steve Jobs built the\nmarket for the Apple Macintosh on its ease of use and\nby providing a standard 'user interface' or way in\nwhich the users interact with programs. This results\nin low training costs and almost immediate\nproductivity. IBM have developed a similar strategy\nrecently, called the Standard Applications\nArchitecture, to be implemented by software\ndevelopers on some of their machines.\nAs an interesting diversion, it is amusing to note just\nhow many supposedly computer literate people are\nreally rather frightened of computers. If something\ngoes wrong, they will invariably claim, 'I never\ntouched it!'. It usually turned out that they pressed\nkeys X and Y in the wrong order and the system fell\nover and waved its legs in the air. This is the\ndesigner's problem, not the operators, but from the\nway people talk and react, you'd think it was the other\nway around.\nSo if many of the problems associated with systems\nfailure are so easily avoided, just why are so many\nunsuitable systems implemented. The fault rarely lies\nwith the technology itself, but with those who\nmanipulate it. Many schemes start off as private\n'babies' for certain managers or departments, who\nsee them as ways of gaining power over other\nmanagers or departments and who push them through\nregardless of their merits. Clients are also frequently\nvictims of their system suppliers, who are interested\nin selling more of their products (and ensuring a steady\nstream of system support work) rather than satisfying\ntheir customers exact needs. 'Impartial' management\nconsultancies these days are quite likely to have their\nown systems houses under their wings and can\npromote the 'best' solution because it is the best for\ntheir own company, not the client's company.\nInformation systems are not inherently doomed to\nfailure, although at times they may seem to be. But\ncareful management, and an examination of the real\nneeds and motives of those involved, are and will\ncontinue to be an integral part of their successful\nimplementation.\nPage 75\n\n"

    "content": "50 YEARS AGO\n\u2022 The effects upon workers, of blacking-out\nwindows in factories are being investigated by the\nIndustrial Health Research Board. Artificial lighting\ntolerated under peace-time conditions is no longer\nacceptable in present circumstances, with longer\nhours being worked. Pre-war practice was mainly\nconcerned with adequate levels of illumination. Poor\nillumination can lead to psychological problems\ncausing a decrease in output of a factory. When\nnatural skylights are blacked out, distracting glare and\ndazzle can produce an objectionable tunnel effect.\nNew means of lighting may be designed to conserve\nmental and physical reserves.\n\u2022 The electron microscope in the McLennan\nLaboratory at Toronto is now claimed to have a resolving power of greater than 60 Angstroms. In a paper last year, the suggested limit was a resolution\nof 200 Angstroms. The improvement is a result of the\ncontrol of the illuminating beam of electrons, and the\nnature of the specimens used.\n\u2022 Imperial's offer to HM Government of the\nservices of the Biological Field Station at Slough has\nbeen gratefully accepted. This commitment during the\nwar will provide research areas for study on insect\ninfestation of food produce. The Department of\nScientific and Industrial Research now takes all staff\nengaged on this project under its own employment\nand, with the consent of the College's Governing\nBody, secures Professor J W Munro as a consultant.\n\u2022 With pressures on the economy rising, and\nunlikely to fall in the foreseeable future, the util is ation of waste products is being emphasised by the Salvage\nDepartment. The sixth report of the Select Committee\non National Expenditure recommends the appointment\nof a national controller of salvage, supervising the\nsalvage work of all departments. The Minister of\nSupply has made it obligatory for local authorities with\na population of more than 10,000 to arrange for the\nefficient collection of salvage.\nThe collection of waste paper doubled between\nNovember last and April to 9,000 tons. Even banana\nstalks have an alternative use as valuable fertilizer.\nThe household cooked bone can provide one eighth\nof its weight in cooked fat and one eighth in glue, with\nthe rest used as feeding meal for cattle or as bone-based fertilizer. All these previously discarded\nmaterials are needed.\n\u2022 'What a lovely pear' was previously an\nover generalisation used by fruit farmers describing\ntheir produce. Now all cultivated pear varieties can be\nclassified using a system by MB Crane and D Lewis.\nThe characteristics suggested are genetically\ncontrolled and can be used with confidence when the\nrange of variations is known. They are: leaf-margin,\nmid-rib, shoot hairiness and leaf colour.\nPage 80\nIf we were the size of a typical insect the world would appear\ncompletely different. We all need homes to live in, however.\nSimon Haslam looks at the more unusual arthropod flat in\nthe city...\nWebs to nests\nIn the natural world, things that crawl the earth's surface find a wide variety of homes to live in. Out\nof over a million species of animals more than three\nquarters are arthropods, that is invertebrates with\njointed legs.\nSpiders\nArthropods build an incredibly diverse range of\nstructures for themselves and spiders are no\nexception. One spider weaves a cocoon and hangs\nonto its underside when swimming below the water\nsurface. This traps a small pocket of air allowing the\nspider to breathe underwater, very much like a diving\nbell. Another spider, the grass spider, spins its web\nin such a way that it forms a dry tent-like enclosure.\nMoney spiders construct large webs in a horizontal\nsheet across gorse and grass. The sheets are\nsupported by vertical strands in which hopping insects\nget tangled, later to fall to their dooms in the\nhammock.\nTermites\nNot all arthropods lead such solitary lives, though.\nTermites, like ants, are very social creatures. They live\ntogether in large colonies and have different forms for\ntheir various roles within the microcosm. Their castle,\nat ermita rium, is made from a range of materials\nincluding earth, rotten wood, clay and other debris,\nwhich varies from one species to another. The fabric\nof the building is usually bonded together with a cement of saliva. The structures are so strong that\ndynamite has been used to clear them in the past.\nThe nests can be up to 5m high and 3m in diameter\nat the base. They frequently extend a metre or so\nunderground. This is particularly true in desert regions,\nwhere the nest can be almost entirely subterranean.\nIn such nests vertical tunnels can go so deep as to\nreach the water table, thus enabling the nest to be\nkept damp.\nIn wet environments, term it a rium s have pitched\nroofs to allow the water to drain away. The nest itself\ncontains a series of chambers interconnected by\ntunnels with the central areas being reserved for the\nking, queen and young brood.\nThe Mastotermes darwin i ensis termite, which lives\nin Northern Australia, is one of the most destructive\ninsects on the planet. There can be up to a million\ntermites per nest, which will attack almost anything.\nAbandoned farms have been turned to dust in less\nthan three years!\nWasps\nWasp colonies thrive in nests at a temperature of\n26-36\u00b0C, some 5-15\u00b0C above the temperature\noutside. The layering of the nest's structure provides\ngood insulation, and central heating is generated from\nactive worker ants and larvae digesting food. Potter\nWasps build mud containers in which they lay eggs\nand deposit paralysed insects, in the larder as it were,\nfor the larvae to feed on later. A variation on the\nnursery theme is the female Praying Mantis who lays\nher eggs in foam which hardens in air so encapsulating\nand protecting the eggs.\nAnts\nThe most common ants' nests are built in the ground,\noften under a log or stone. Dedicated worker ants\nbuild the nest, grain by grain. The constructions are\nbuilt to last; some nests are more than twenty years\nold! The workers shift the brood to other parts of the\nnest according to whether the surroundings are dry\nor wet, hot or cold in order to give the right conditions\nThe intricate nest of the wood ant can be more than\na metre high and is built from grass, twigs, soil and\nA Hermit crab complete with hoarded shells^ The shells shown are not the customary snail\nbut are those of cockles and scallops.\n\n"

    "content": "Film\nA Tale of Springtime\nThis is the first film in the series Tales of the Four\nSeasons directed by Eric Rohmer. A Tale of Springtime\nis a rather tepid exploration of the ever-Rohmerian\ntheme of relationships. Jeane is a philosophy teacher\nwho has two apartments, but feels she has no home.\nShe befriends a young girl (Natasha) at a party and\nis invited to stay with her for a few days. Natasha lives\nin a massive apartment where her divorced,\nwoman ising father drops by every now and then. He\nin turn lives with his girlfriend, Eve, only slightly older\nthan Natasha herself. Their lives are thus ready to be\ncomplicated, and dilemmas presented. Natasha does\neverything in her power to eliminate the obnoxious\nL 'Atalante\nEve, and tries to hook Jeanne up with her father (Igor,\nwould you believe). Igor tells that he is ready to drop\nEve and put his seduction plan into gear. Jeanne\nrejects him, etc, etc.\nThe film leaves you cold because it is neither clever\nor witty enough (as this kind of middle-class French\nfilm invariably tries to be) nor is it charming enough\nto move the viewer. By the end the characters have\nprobably moved on, or even 'learnt something', but\nyou can't help thinking as you leave the cinema: so\nwhat?\nI.H. Film\nThis the restored version of Jean Vigo's1934 release,\nwhich at the time was heavily cut and proved to be\na commercial failure. The new print has added eight\nminutes to the originally 81 minute film, giving\nArtificial Eye (the backers of the new print) an excuse\nfor a re-release.\nThe film is basically a 'warm' \"Study of four\ncharacters aboard a barge travelling up and down the\ncanals of France. The captain (Jean Daste) marries a peasant girl (wonderfully played by Dita Paris) who\nlongs to escape the boredom of village life. Also\naboard the ship is an eccentric, grizzled mate (Michel\nSimon) and a boy.\nPage 16\nThe film is a little hard-going at the beginning but\none is very quickly seduced by the charm Vigo has\ninvested in his characters. There are some brilliant\nscenes, particularly when Dita Paris is in the mate's filthy room which is full of little pieces of treasure he\nhas collected from around the world through his entire\nlife. In another scene the haggard mate single-handedly beats himself in an example of what he calls\n'Freaco-Roman wrestling'.\nIf you think you can handle an old, black and white,\nFrench film one evening, look out for this one. It's good.\nI.H. Music\nMozart\nShostakovich\nDvorak\nViolin\u2014G Kremer\nConductor\u2014J Tate\nThe programme opened with Mozart's Adagio and\nFugue in C minor. Originally developed for two pianos,\nthis is a highly technically accomplished composition\nand displays a seriousness not usually associated with\nMozart. The LSO string sections provided a polished\nperformance which prepared the audience for the next\npiece.\nShostakovich's second Violin Concerto was\ncomposed in 1967. As with much of his later work,\nit is shot through with disquiet and resignation, the\norchestra providing a bleak and melancholy\nbackground to the soloist. Gidon Kremer's playing\nwas electrifying, swooping between the necessary\nchanges in tone and pace with apparent ease. His full,\nstrong sound dominated the orchestra, and indeed\ntheir playing was almost irrelevant, so totally\ncompelling was this performance. Kremer himself\nseemed overwhelmed by the occasion, and it was a nice touch to see the soloist calling upon the audience\nto acknowledge the orchestra before taking the\njustified rapturous applause for his own performance.\nThe second half of the programme began\ndisappointingly. Jeffrey Tate, who is principal\nconductor at the Royal Opera, Covent Garden,\nobviously wanted to bring out the lyrical and fluid side\nof Dvorak's seventh symphony. Unfortunately this led\nto the first movement being so fluid it could have been\nwrung out and hung out to dry. The playing lacked\nthe sharpness needed to give shape to the piece. The\nsecond movement was simply massacred. Starting\nwith the emphasis on subtlety, the contrast between\nthe extended quiet passages and the introduction of\nthe brass section was completely lost. Later this was\nreversed as loud passages began so loudly there was\nnowhere left for them to go and the orchestra ended\nup straining themselves trying to achieve more and\nmore force.\nIn the third movement, the piece at last began to\ntake shape, with some excellent, crisp playing. This\nwas certainly forced on the orchestra by the speed\nat which Tate took the movement, leaving the\naudience as well as the players breathless. However\nTate's interpretation redeemed itself in the final\nmovement, where the orchestra was finally allowed\nto show the delicate touch and sensibility of which\nit is more than capable.\nLondon is blessed with a wealth of orchestras of\nmany types, but for my preference, the London\nSymphony Orchestra is the best in London at the\nmoment, even if some guest conductors get less than\nsparkling performances out of them, and the Barbican\nHall is an excellent showcase for their talents.\nLiz Warren.\nLSO\n\n"

Starring Warren\nBeatty, Madonna and Al Pacino with a huge number\nof cameos, including one by Dustin Hoffman, it is\nbased on the Thirties' and Forties' comic strip. Tracy\nwill be up against a wide variety of villains from Flattop\nto Pruneface, all to a backing of Stephen Sondheim\nmusic. Madonna herself sings and a tie in album has\nbeen released (See Music Pages). The film sounds\nintriguing...\nAlso likely to be popular are the sequels hitting the\nstreets. Gremlins II (released July 27) sees the return\nof Mogwai and his human owners, who have to\ncombat a whole new batch of these little beastie s, this\ntime in a tower bearing not a little resemblance to\nTrump Towers. Back to the Future III (released July\n11) is reviewed on page 19.\nThe team behind Top Gun are back with Tom Cruise\nin Days Of Thunder (released 10 August) which will\nbe probably be more of the same except with stock\ncars. Tom Hanks is still struggling to equal the success\nof Big, after the mediocrity of The 'Burbs and Turner\nand Hooch. Joe Versus the Volcano (release July 6)\ncould be it as he teams up with Meg Ryan (When\nHarry Met Sally) to escape from a boring urban life and\ncombat a Pacific volcano. Clint Eastwood will be\nstriding back onto our screens in White Hunter, Black\nHeart (released Sept 21), playing a film-maker gunning\nfor an elephant. Eastwood also directs and produces.\nWell, at least he didn't do an Eddie Murphy and write\nit as well. Mr. Murphy himself will be back with us\nsoon in Another 24 hours.\nWoody Allen is playing the writing/acting/directing\ngame again with Crimes and Misdemeanors (released\nJuly 20th), co-starring Alan Alda (Hawkeye of\nM*A*S*H). It's( apparently) about love, reality, faith,\ndelusions, success, failure, good and evil which gives\nhim plenty room to mano eu ver. Stella (released\nSeptember 7th) brings Bette Midler and John\nGoodman back to our screens in a touching tale of a mother' love for her daughter and the self-sacrifice she\nendures to give her the life she herself could never\nhave. It is also a second remake! Sometime in\nSeptember we may also see Robin Williams in Cadillac\nMan as a woman ising Cadillac salesman who ends up\nin trouble with an angry husband.\nFor horror freaks Tremors (released 29 June) is a traditional monster movie combining science fiction\nand humour. The Guardian (released 31 August) is\nnot, despite the name, the first movie adaptation of\na newspaper, but a tale of a young couple moving to\nthe country. After employing a nanny to look after\ntheir young son they get caught up in the forces of\nevil. This fairly standard horror flick stars Jenny\nSeagrove.\nWhile on the theme of children we have Problem\nChild (released 7 September).

    "content": "The death of two students taking part in drug trials has highlighted the dangers trials can pose. Martin Davies investigates the truth of the matter.\nThe human guinea pigs\nHuman Volunteer Drugs Trials (HVDTs) are\nincreasingly becoming a source of quick cash for debt-laden students, student nurses and travellers. But the\ndeaths of two students in the early 1980s, and the\nincreasing number of unsubstantiated stories of\ndubious, poorly supervised tests, have heightened\nfears over risks to volunteers.\nHVDTs are, at present, the final stage in the testing\nof drugs prior to their possible launch on the market.\nAll drugs have side effects, therefore no drug can ever\n'pass' a drug trial. Rather, it is the purpose of the trial\nto determine the nature of side effects and whether\nthese outweigh the potential benefits. Whether this\ncriterion is met will depend upon the 'treatments'\nalready on the market, and upon the medical condition\nbeing treated. For example, it is extremely difficult to\nbring a new painkiller onto the market because there\nare several effective painkillers in existence with\nrelatively minor side effects. In contrast, cytotoxic\ndrugs, used for cancer treatment, are often extremely\npoisonous: one such group of drugs is related to\nmustard gas! But the extremely harsh side effects of\nthese drugs are tolerated because of the potential\nlonger term benefits in the treatment of life\nthreatening cancers.\nMedical students at St Mary's will be familiar with\nnotices asking for human volunteers willing to\nparticipate in clinical testing of drugs, monitoring of\ndiet, body functions, and many other (often\ncompletely benign) observations. But there is evidence\nthat an increasing number of non-medical students\nand travellers are participating in drugs trials. With tax\nfree payments of up to \u00a3900 for a two week trial on\na specialist unit the inducements are obvious, but the\never increasing financial pressures on students mean\nthat the potential abuse of the system as a source of\n'money for nothing' is clear.\nSo what rules and legislation apply to HVDTs? In\n1986 the Royal College of Physicians (RCP) prepared\nguidance for doctors after the deaths of two students\nduring trials. These give broad safety standards and\nrecommend that payment be limited to pocket money\nor repayment of loss of earnings. The Association of\nIndependent Clinical Research Contractors (AICRC) is\na voluntary organisation which represents most of the\nlarge drug testing contractors; it's members choose\nto work to strict guidelines governing their practice.\nThe NUS recently drew up a short guidance\ndocument, after consultation with the ICRC, which\nlists fourteen basic requirements that a drugs trial\nshould meet before any student participates. Other\nthan general law relating to negligence and medical\npractice in general, however, there is no specific\nlegislation relating to human volunteer drug trials.\nIt would seem that there are stricter legally binding\ncontrols on animal experiments than on those\ninvolving human beings.\nDr Elizabeth Allen from the Guy's Drugs Research\nUnit (GDRU) (perhaps the best known HVDT centre)\nis also a representative of the AICRC. She felt that\n'legislation wouldn't make it (HVDT) any safer' and\nthat the AICRC wouldn't be worried by any legislation\nthat might be introduced, as the guidelines followed\nby their members were more than strict enough. The\ninstructions given to volunteers for a typical drug trial\nat GRDU, do show that at GRDU a responsible and\ncomprehensive set of guidelines is followed and that\nexcellent medical facilities and qualified staff are\navailable at all times.\nPaae 66\nSo what's the problem? There seems to be no hard\nevidence to suggest that the horror stories about\nstudent having their hearts stopped or bowels highly\npress uri sed are anything other than myths. A recent\narticle in The Times (March 29,1990) describing how\n'one student had reportedly been paid \u00a32,000 to have\nhis heart stopped and restarted' is pure speculation.\nDespite the introductions of guidelines, there are still\na number of aspects of current HVDT practice which\nshould be of some concern.\n1. The growing pressure to take part in drugs\ntrials for purely financial reasons. The NUS\nguidelines state that 'no financial inducement or\ncoercion should colour your judgement and payment\nmust never be offered for risk'. This appears to be\nrather naive; if you're rapidly approaching your\noverdraft limit plus the \u00a3425 loan you've been obliged\nto take, it's fair to say that the chance to supplement\nthis with a tax free payment of \u00a3200 might just\n'colour your judgement'.\n2. The increasing number of non-medical students\nparticipating in HVDTs. Traditionally the medical\nschools have been the main source of volunteers. It\ncan be argued that it's actually quite educational for\na trainee doctor to 'see the needle from the other end'\nso to speak, and of course the beer money always\ncomes in handy. Clearly a medical student will have\na reasonably good idea of what's going on and is more\nlikely to know when to report any unusual sensations.\nBut worries that medical students may be adversely\naffecting their studies, particularly at exam time,\nmeans that their medical schools are usually aware\nfo their participation in the drugs trial. No such\nundertaking is made for non-medical students.\nTwo years ago the Dean of St Mary's Hospital Medical\nSchool specifically requested his students not to take\npart in drugs trials during and leading up to exam time.\nWhat about other students at other universities?\nSurely this potential problem needs acting upon in\nsome way?\n3. The reliance on the volunteer to fully disclose\ntheir medical history. It is very easy to be high and\nmighty about this: 'if you don't tell them then it serves\nyou bloody well right.' The NUS and AICRC say that\n'you must authorise, and they (the contractors) must\nrequest, your permission to assess your past medical\nhistory from your general practitioner'. This is NOT\na commitment to obtain your medical history, only a granting of permission. So what will happen when\nsomeone eventually does or nearly dies through not\nrevealing a previous illness. The recent increase in the\nnumber of travellers-from Australia, South Africa\netc-taking part in drugs trials at GDRU, makes it\nunlikely that their medical history is going to be\nobtained from their GP. And it goes without saying\nthat financial inducement is bound to colour their\njudgements (plane tickets do cost money!).\nAfter reading this, if you still feel that you must or\nwant to participate in drugs trials, then don't do it at\nexam time-you'll be under enough stress, without\nworrying about why you've suddenly grown a second\nhead. Finally, satisfy yourself that at the very least\nthe following basic requirements are met by the trial:\n1. For all students taking part, the study must involve\nno more than minimal risk.\n2. No financial inducement or coercion should colour\nyour judgement and payment must never be offered\nfor risk.\n3. There must be close qualified medical supervision\nfor the whole period of the trial, and not just when\nthe drugs are administered.\n4. Full resuscitation equipment and facilities must be\non hand, with trained staff to use them.\n5. Confidentiality must be maintained throughout and\nbeyond the trial.\n6. The organisation should hold full insurance and\ncompensate without regard to negligence.\n7. You must authorise, and they must request, your\npermission to assess your past medical history from\nyour general practitioner. Full records must be\nmaintained by. the organisation and your GP.\n8. Only sign a consent form that you have read in full,\nand that gives you the right of withdrawal from the\nstudy at any time without having to give a reason.\n9. You should be healthy at the time of the trial and\nundergo a full medical examination.\n10. Do not witt hold any information regarding any\nfood you may have eaten or drugs you have taken\n(this includes common non-prescription medicines and\nalcohol).\n11. You should report immediately any unusual\nsensations you may experience during the trial, and\nsubsequently to your GP.\n12. Leave at least twelve weeks between any trials\nyou participate in, and inform the company of any\nprevious trials.\n13. Before participating, ask the organisation for proof\nof membership of the Association of Independent\nClinical Research Contractors.\n14. Always remember that whether the drug is 'tried\nand tested' or new on the market, you may\nindividually suffer adverse reaction.\nIf any of the above requirements are not met, do not\ntake part, and report your findings to the NUS who\nmay be able to warn other students.\nCase study\nSimon took part in a four day drug trial last July (name\nand date changed). The trial was part of the tests\nrequired before the licensing of the slow release tablet\ndrug Ramitidine, a treatment for stomach and\nduodenal ulcers, in the UK. A few days before the trial\nSomon and other applicants were screened prior to\nselection of volunteers.\nSimon was given a full explanation by a Doctor of\nthe purpose of the trial, what he would be expected\nto do, and of the physical and/or psychic effects\nwhich he should or might expect to experience. He\nthen had a blood sample taken, an electro-cardiogram\nrecorded, a full medical examination, and provided a urine sample. He was also asked about his medical\nhistory and finally signed a consent form (with the\nright to withdraw from the trial at any time).\nAfter being selected, Simon was asked to report to\nthe hospital at 6.30pm on the evening before the first\ndose. He was not allowed to drink alcohol for 48 hours\nbefore his admission and not allowed to eat or smoke\nfrom 10pm on the evening of the admission until\nsometime the following day.\nAt about 8am on the study day Simon was given\na tablet and intravenous blood samples were then\ntaken regularly over the next 32 hours. Six days later\nhe was readmitted and the same procedure was\nrepeated. A final blood sample was taken on a visit\nsix days after the second dose.\nAs well as the restrictions mentioned above, Simon\nwas asked not to take any other medication-both for\nhis own safety and to prevent contamination of the\nresults of the experiment-without first contacting the\ndoctor in charge of the trial.\nThe payment for this? A cheque for \u00a3300. Needless\nto say, for Simon, this was considerably more than\neither 'pocket-money' or 'loss of earnings'!\nPage 67\n\n"

    "content": "This is the last editorial of my year as FELIX editor and,\nas such, it contains a great deal of my own personal\nconclusions and heartfelt regrets, some of which I have been unprepared to voice before now. I hope that\nwhat I am about to write will not be taken as a personal attack by anyone, but as a comment upon\ntheir position within the college in a professional\nsetting.\nThe Union\nI started the year determined to cooperate with the\nunion. I had seen the unproductive results of past\nmedia campaigns against the body which supposedly\nrepresents the students and I had no wish to repeat\nthese tragedies.\nAs the year progressed I began to find it harder and\nharder to accept the ineptitude of one sabbatical who\nshall remain nameless. A sabbatical should be\nsomeone who sets good examples, I thought. I was\nwrong. I had not comprehended who really runs the\nstudents union. The union is not really a representative\nof the students. It has a management committee,,\ncalled council, full of students, 90% of whom have\nbeen spineless knobs, not worth the job title they\naspired to for its CV credibility. It has a sovereign\nbody, the UGM, which is poorly attended and does\nvery little. In short, the Union has no input from\nstudents. It relies upon discussions around the union\noffice and the, often unwise, advice of the permanent\nstaff.\nThe Union's entire raison d'e tre is now just self\nfulfillment. Many of the plans for the future involve\nexpenditure on things 'for the union office.' The\nstudents have become a secondary aspect to that of\nthe growing number of trading outlets and the needs\nof 'the union.' Few ex-sabbaticals would have\nenvisaged the purchase of a computerised network\nfor the union office next year, but this will be a major\npart of this year's spending. At the same time, clubs\nand societies have been pushed into cutting their\nbudgets. The clubs are where the real students meet\nthe Union. The end result will be a computerised union\noffice, which nobody will be able to operate, and an\neven greater degree of bureaucracy as students will\nbe required to enter numbers etc 'for use on the\ncomputer.'\nIt is about time the union started to think of itself,\nonce more, as the 'union' rather than 'the union\noffice.' The sad fact is that I cannot see a great deal\nof change forthcoming. The union has been stagnated\nby the dogged opinions of those who think they know\nbetter within the union office. Until these mini empire\nbuilders leave there is little hope for progress beyond\nthe petty power politics which currently prevail. The\nbest thing that could happen is the abolition of NALGO\namongst the, now divided, staff of the union.\nThe College\nI started my year as FELIX editor with some frank\nopinions about the rector. These have not changed.\nI am sorry to say that the rector would make a far\nbetter politician than a manager. Every reply he has\nwritten this year has skirted the issue I previously\ncomplained about. This is a crazy college, where the\nman who is nominally in charge is really the court\njester.\nThe entry of Angus Fraser as managing director may\nhave a long term influence upon the college's poor\norganisation and internal communications. And it may\nnot. Mr Fraser has arrived at Imperial with a fresh\noutlook. He wants value for money, he says, which\nis more than anyone ever asked for before at IC. I just\nwonder how long his initial enthusiasm will last.\nSomebody once told me that the problem with\nImperial College is that it is made up of a large number\nof independent empires, known as departments. What\nmay be acceptable in one department may not be in\nanother. For instance, the mathematics department\nis a no smoking zone. There is no clear cut college\nwide plan on whether every department should be a no smoking zone. This would require somebody to tell\nthe departments to do something, which they would\nreject out of hand, on the principle that departments\ncannot be preached to. You can recommend a great\ndeal, but each department will eventually perform its\nown wishes, and sod the group decision. Angus Fraser\nhas to face the task of co-ordinating the heads of\nthese departments if he is to succeed where others\nhave tried and failed. His chances are very small. Very\nfew of the Heads of Departments know much about\nmanagement and fewer still know the meaning of the\nwords 'value for money.'\nI shall be interested to see the fruits of Mr Eraser's attempts in three years, when I believe he will have\ngiven up and left.\nAttitudes\nImperial College has an ethos of its very own. This\nis probably best summarised by the phrase 'I'm alright\nJack.' Students at Imperial College typify the self-centred attitude which is usually prevalent in children\nrather than adults. Distributing FELIX this year has\ntaught me more about human nature than ever. I still\nremember the days on which, after successfully\nbattling to hold open the double set of doors at the\nentrance to the mechanical engineering building with\na trolley full of FELICES, I was confronted by a student\nbarging through the opening I had spent five minutes\ntrying to secure. The people who held doors open for\nme were generally staff. The average student seemed\nfar too wrapped up in themself to even consider\nhelping me. I cannot see this narrow minded, selfish\nattitude abating. My time at Imperial has taught me\nto be hard nosed to this kind of person. Maybe this\nis IC's idea of a preparation for the real world. I hope\nnot.\nCommittees\nOne breed of creature so prevalent at Imperial is 'Mr\nCommittee.' Both the college and the union love him.\nThe best sort of committee in their minds is one which\nis guaranteed to last more than 3 hours, involve a damned heated argument and result in practically no\nchange. This description fits almost all of the union's committees and most of the college committees upon\nwhich students are represented.\nThe academic committees are self sustaining PR\nexercises, designed to make you feel better as you\nendure some of the worst lecturing techniques\naround. They help produce lecturer evaluation\nquestionnaires, whose results are posted upon\nnoticeboards. Students are left to decipher their\nmeaning from a list of numbers and letters (just look\nin the chem eng department if you want to see an\nexample of such a badly presented report.) The end\nresult of the whole exercise is a set of answers which\nthe college wanted to hear, from a set of questions\ndesigned to extract such a response. The\n\n"

    "content": "Seriously folks, FELIX says 'don't mess with drugs. '\nD$H%& \u00a3HB3L!GJ%!?\nThis year saw the first warning sign of drug abuse at\nIC for sometime. A sign in Southside bar warned\nstudents of the College's policy on drug abuse upon\nits premises. If you are caught, you will be prosecuted.\nAmerican students were smoking marijuana in the bar\nand the staff were becoming concerned that IC might\nlose its licence if the police were to raid the bar. Their\nconcern is one which I share. Why should drug users\nendanger the facilities open to all students? The\nquestion of taking drugs in your own home is another\nmatter.\nThe Government's Central Office of Information\n(COI) is currently running a campaign against drug\nabuse. The horrific tale they portray of teenagers\ndying whilst under the influence of drugs is a strong\nimage designed to shock rather than inform. Few\npeople are ever told of the actual effects of a drug.\nAs a well known media celebrity once said, 'Drugs are\ngreat, it's just the morning after...'\nMarijuana\nPot, dope, blow, hash; marijuana probably has more\nnames attached to it than any other drug. It also has\nthe greatest amount of mystique and hearsay\nsurrounding it. Many people argue that it's just the\nbeginning of the road to ruin. They are also the people\nwho fear that vitamin pills may only be the beginning\nof a drug problem. The COI have nurtured this kind\nof blinkered thinking in order to mask the true\ngovernment policy on the matter: Britain does not\nwant another drug on the market. Tobacco and\nalcohol are already freely available to the general\npublic, under a strict and costly system of excise and\nduties. The manpower cost of administering the\ntaxation and movement, is just one area the\ngovernment would rather avoid. The current argument\nwould collapse under a legal is ed system. People\nwould have to seek out 'hard' drug pushers to buy\ndrugs more serious than marijuana. The pushers\nwould move further underground as the'soft' side of\ntheir sales, represented by marijuana, fell through.\nForced to peddle hard drugs only, they would place\nthemselves at a higher legal risk. (The penalties for\ndealing in hard drugs are far higher than those for\nselling marijuana.)\nSo what is all the fuss about?\nThe effects of cannabis are similar to those of alcohol.\nCannabis, however, is not a depressant. You can get\nstoned when you're down as well as when you're up.\nAlcohol is a depressant, and the effects of getting\ndrunk when depressed tend to add to the 'down'\nfeeling. Cannabis has never been proven to have any\nphysically addictive effects, whereas alcohol is known\nto be physically addictive. The fuss is that we are\nsubjected to a hard sell for alcohol, in every form of\nmedia possible and yet we are told that cannabis is\nan evil of society. The public are being conned in big\nway for the sake of a little administrative ease.\nCannabis is great and cheap! A quarter of an ounce\nof the stuff will probably cost you \u00a325-30. When you\nconsider that a sixteenth of an ounce of cannabis is\nenough to get most people 'stoned' it works out far\ncheaper than alcohol. The problem is that people still\ndon't find it socially acceptable.\nThe law still applies a weird kind of logic to\ncannabis. Graded as a 'class B' drug, it has far more\nlax sentencing for usage. Many people are let off with\na warning but dealers can be given a prison sentence.\nYou are classified as a dealer if you are carrying a quarter of an ounce or more of cannabis.\nThe biggest problem that students at Imperial face is\nnot being able to find any and not knowing what to\ndo with it once they've got it. As far as the former\nis concerned there is little advice I can offer. What is\nworth noting is that people who buy cannabis from\nsomebody they don't know, in a pub are asking to be\nripped off. Unscrupulous dealers are commonplace in\nLondon and will happily cut cannabis with all manner\nof substances, including shoe polish. They will happily\nsell you an underweight chunk or a lump of 0X0. The\nbest place to buy dope is from a friend.\nWhat to do with it.\nAlthough the standard joint is easy enough to\nproduce, the joys of a bubble pipe are certainly\nsomething worth writing home about (but not\nliterally.)\nInstructions\nTo make your own FELIX bubble pipe you will need.\n1 Demijohn (available from Boots).\n1 Large funnel\n1 Large foil pie tray\n1 packet of Blu Tak (available from ICU Bookstore)\n1 needle 3ft of syphon hosing (available from Boots\nwine section)\n2 pints of water\n1 lump of cannabis (approx. one sixteenth of an ounce\nbetween two people)\n1 lighter\n1. Pierce the foil tray with the needle to form a fine\nmesh gauze at its centre.\n2. Attach the pie tray to the funnel with part of the\nblu tak, making sure you have formed an air-tight seal.\n3. Attach a1 ft length of the hosing to the end of the\nfunnel.\n4. Place the funnel and the rest of the hosing into the\nneck of the demijohn, filled half full with water.\n5. Seal the hosing and funnel with the remainder of\nthe blu tak, forming an air-tight seal.\n(Note that the hosing from the funnel should be below\nthe surface of the water. The other section should be\nabove the surface of the water.)\n6. Place the cannabis on the gauze section of the tray\nand run a flame over it.\n7. Suck the hosing whilst warming the cannabis.\n8. Enjoy.\nPage 49\n\n"

    "content": "How do you like your\nfur, madam?\nGassed or trapped?\nLYNX FUR-Once the ultimate fashion accessory, now\nconsidered to be what it is; the cruel death of a large\nnumber of animals. LYNX, the anti fur trading\norganisation, started its campaign in 1985, whilst the\nfur trade was at a peak. Five years on, after some\n'very powerful and critically acclaimed, advertising\ncampaigns,' sales figures for fur goods in the United\nKingdom have declined by over 75%.\nThe Department of Trade and Industry has\nregistered a decline in fur sale from \u00a380 million in\n1984 to \u00a311 million in the first half of 1989. The\noutlook for fur trading companies looks bleak. There\nis no longer a huge demand for mink coats and other\nfur goods. This year, Harrods was forced to close its\nlong running fur department; the last survivor in the\nHouse of Fraser group. Selfridges, the only other major\ndepartment store selling furs in London, has yet to\ndetermine its policy on selling fur, although the store\nhas effectively served notice to quit upon its current\nfur concession, Jindo.\nAnother main fur retailer has also left the U.K. The\nHudson Bay Company, which once auctioned the\nskins of millions of animals, has transferred operations\nto Helsinki, bringing an end to more than 300 years\nof fur trading and trapping in the UK.\n40% of Europe's fur is traded through the Hudson Bay\nCompany, although in recent years there has been a reduction of the business. It has sold all of its\nCanadian trading posts and its Toronto auction house.\nThe company has held a Royal Charter since the reign\nof King Charles II, and it is rumoured that a large\nproportion of its shares are still owned by the Royal\nfamily.\nOne of the largest fur factories in the U.K. is set to\nclose, after supplying fur manufacturers with skins for\nthe last 38 years. The reason cited for the closure of\nthe Hawkyard mink factory in Yorkshire was a Worldwide over-production of mink skins. The true\nreason is a lack of demand, which continues to fall\nas the younger generations become more naturally\naware.\n\u00a3 MILLION SALES OF FUR GOODS MANUFACTURED IN UK\n120\n100\n40\n20\niI JJ_ This creature is obviously in severe pain, but so what? The skin will be used to a good cause,\nthat of the fashion trade, a status symbol for the rich, luxury garments bought at a heavy price\nin animal pain and suffering.\n1980 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88\nContrary to popular belief, 92% of all fur comes\nfrom factory-farming methods, where mink and fox\nare reared in hundreds of tiny wire cages. Mink are\nnormally kept in pairs in cages typically 30x9x15 inches. These farms produce pelts which are relatively\ncheap, with high consistency and quality, and a large\nvariety of colours. Variety comes from selective\nbreeding, which often results in distressing genetic\nside effects. The animals are slaughtered before they\nare a year old. Methods include gassing, commonly\nwith car exhaust fumes; lethal injection or\nelectrocution. Foxes are killed by the use of mouth\n(clamp or rod) and anus (rod) electrodes connected\nto a portable 12v battery via a step up transformer\nproducing approximately 200v. This can lead to\nprolonged deaths if the battery is not in perfect\ncondition. To fac il it are in the pelting process, the skins\nare usually removed whilst the animal is still warm\nwhich prevents bleeding.\nOver a ton of protein enriched food goes into the\nproduction of every full length coat. Half of the Finnish\nherring catch goes into feeding animals on fur farms,\neven though the catch could be better used to help\ncure the starvation that is apparent throughout the\nWorld at this time.\nMink farms should legally be su rounded by a secure\nboundary fence to prevent the escape of potentially\ndestructive non-native species. Many farms are\ninsecure and Mink have been photographed after\nescaping into the wild. Feral Mink, previously a non-native species, escaped from fur farms and have now\nbecome well established in mainland Britain. The\neradication of the Feral Mink was eventually given up\nby the MAFF (Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and\nFood) in 1970 as it became apparent just how\nwidespread they had become.\nPage 9\n\n"

    "content": "Rhydian Hapgood discusses the consequences ofthe Government's reform ofthe NHS and looks to tA risky operation\nOn January 25 1988, the Prime Minister announced\nthe Government's intention to reform the NHS. The\nWhite Paper 'Working for Patients' was published the\nfollowing year, followed by eight working papers. By\nthe end of 1991, the first NHS Hospital Trusts will be\nestablished, the first GP practice budget holders will\nbe buying services for their patients, drug budget\nschemes will have been implemented, and District\nHealth Authorities (DMA) will be paying directly for\nthe work they do for each other. This plethora of\nchanges raises a number of questions. Why the need\nfor change? What will be the effects on medical\neducation? Is this the correct way forward for medical\nteaching, practice and research in the UK?\nThe need for change\nThere is an increasing disparity between the\ncontribution to health that modern medicine can\nprovide and the amount of money available. It is\nwrong that, in spite of steady rises in Government\nspending, NHS resources are ever more constrained\nand waiting lists continue to increase.\nThe effect on medical education\nThe White Paper places little emphasis upon medical\neducation and research. Only a token commitment to\nthese areas is expressed and the Working Papers give\nlittle additional detail.\nEach DHA will be obliged to supply only a baseline\nof core services with little restriction upon where\nthese, or the non-core services, are to be obtained.\nA major concern is that hospitals may decide that it\nis more cost-effective to provide fewer services in\norder to specialise in certain fields, and patients with\na particular condition may not be referred locally.\nUndergraduate training depends on the provision of\na wide range of core and complementary services in\nteaching centres. It is therefore necessary for\nspecialists in a correspondingly wide range of\ndisciplines to be concentrated in these same centres.\nFailure to achieve this will mean that students will not\nreceive the case mix required to produce competent\ndoctors capable of making informed decisions. With\nthe referral of patients to geographically distant\nlocations (perhaps more than one!) students will find\nit hard to observe their patients' progress through the\nvarious stages of their illness. Perhaps community\nservices should be included in opted-out trusts to\nprovide continuity of care.\nIndependent hospitals subcontracting to the private\nsector will result in students not receiving any\ninstruction in that particular discipline. In addition,\nmany medical schools have a clinical course involving\nseveral hospitals, some of which may choose to\nassume self-governing status whilst others may not.\nThese changes would result in fragmentary teaching\nprogrammes. An obvious remedy for this is for a group\nof hospitals to opt out together.\nThe costs Of undergraduate teaching within the\nNHS are difficult to dissect from the costs of providing\nhealth care, as both are closely linked. There is much\noverlap in the work performed by University and NHS\nstaff in hospitals and there has been a traditional\n'knock-for-knock' arrangement between medical\nschools and health authorities, based on a certain\namount of goodwill and flexibility among medical\npersonnel. A commercial environment would lead to\nthe disappearance of this relationship and valuable\nteaching will be lost. In addition, increasing\nconcentration on cost-effectiveness may lead to\nPage 54\nhospitals regarding it as impractical to retain the\nadditional staff required for teaching. The present\nsystem owes part of its effectiveness to the fact that\nit requires virtually no administration: the proposed\nidentification of the specific costs involved would\nrequire a large administrative input in both the medical\nschool and the health authority.\nNo provision is made in the White Paper for the\ncosts incurred by academic practices in respect of\nteaching and research activities. At present, such\npractices are permitted to restrict their lists to allow\ntime for teaching and research. Under the new\nproposals, with a substantially greater proportion of\nfunding coming from capita tion fees, academic\npractices will have to sacrifice teaching in order to\nmaintain large enough lists for adequate funding. GPs\nin non-academic practices are also likely to have less\ntime available to teach.\nIn order to facilitate planning, finding and evaluation\nof medical education, joint management between\nhospital trusts, DHAs and medical schools is desirable\nfor main and associated university hospitals and their\ndistricts. The proposed level of university\nrepresentation on the relevant committees is\ninsufficient to ensure that the needs of medical\neducation and research will be considered fully.\nLondon University trains one third of Britain's doctors and 28% of the country's dentists. The\nGovernment's argument that 3% higher capita tion will\nbe sufficient to meet the extra costs of operating in\na capital city, where the population has high medical\nand social needs, remains unconvincing. Costeffective and rapid reimbursement should be available\nto cover the treatment of the acute needs of\ncommuters and visitors to London. The mechanism\nby which this will be assured has not been\ndemonstrated.\nOf particular concern to London is the proposed\ncapital charges. London Teaching Hospitals, through\nno fault of their own, are on sites which are extremely\nvaluable and so the capital charges to be incurred\nwould be proportionately high. These high costs,\ncoupled with the high costs of employing labour in\nLondon, would make it very difficult for these\ninstitutions to be financially competitive.\nPostgraduate training is at risk. It is difficult to see\nhow, even by contracting out training, Regional Health\nAuthorities will be able to ensure that Hospital\nManagers will maintain costly supernumerary training\nposts. In addition, it is very likely that there will be\nfewer Junior posts within the hospital service. For\nexample, a supervised registrar will take longer to\ncarry out an operation than will a consultant. Hospitals\nwill look un favourably upon this owing to commercial\npressures. Hospitals will probably make most of the\nreductions in GP training posts as self-governing trusts\nare likely to put their own priorities before those of\nnational requirements.\nResearch will be adversely affected. In order to\ndevelop the health service, it must be possible to try\nout new ideas and undertake research. Although the\ntime and resources required may not be cost effective\nin the first instance, new methods may be developed\nwhich would eventually prove to be more economical\nthan existing techniques; the advance of medicine\nmust not be overly constrained by financial\nconsiderations.\nThe way forward for the NHS\nThere is a need for change in the NHS. However, the\nproposed changes will, if introduced nationwide, very\nseriously disrupt the health service. There is no\nevidence that the changes overall will improve the\nstandard of care, access to care, or its cost\neffectiveness. Furthermore, there is no evidence that\nforcing teaching hospitals and medical schools to\nspend large sums on costing and on billing to replace\nthe present system of freely given mutual assistance\nwill improve either patient care or medical education\nand research. The Government's proposals are based\non theory rather than on practical experience. We\nshould urge the Government to accept that their main\nproposals, if they are to be introduced, should be done\nso as part of a carefully planned programme initially\nlimited to not more than two regions, and carefully\nmonitored. They can then be evaluated and modified\nbefore they are introduced more broadly. This\nevaluation should take into account that facilities for\nthe education and training of medical, nursing and\nother professions will change, as change is required,\nbut must identify and foster changes that can be\nshown to be beneficial, and modify those that are\nshown to be less effective. It is in the interests of the\nGovernment, the Public, the professions and the\nstudents to ensure that the whole of the NHS is not\nthe subject of a gigantic and costly experiment with\na high risk of failure.\n\n"

    "content": "I was talking to an acquaintance last week who, when\nI mentioned the Trafalgar riot and the fact that I was\nthere, looked at me in disgust and said 'Did you\ndemonstrate!' Surely it is the basic right of an\nindividual to protest about a matter that they feel is\nunfair or that they just disagree with? Why then, do\nI feel as though I have violated some major unwritten\ncode? Do I just sit back and let the powers that be\nimpose their will on me? Or stand up and say how I feel? For the first time in my life I took the latter\ndecision. Now, as I read the papers and watch the\ntelevision I am labelled in with the 'hooligans' and\nmilitants of this world.\nThe aim of the day, that Saturday, was to present\na show of opposition to not only the Poll Tax, but to\nthe Government and its method of almost dictatorial\ngoverning. The Poll Tax is the first issue that has\naffected the population as a whole. The students,\nnurses and ambulance men have all had their justified\nreasons to march and no less important were they but\nthis affects me, you, your parents, and if it is allowed\nto remain law as it is now, your offspring.\nKennington Park, where the march gathered, was\nfull to capacity of all cross sections of society;\npensioners in their hundreds, students in their\nthousands, the hopeless, the well off, the general\npublic. After a few speeches, one imploring for a peaceful end to the day greeted by an all agreeing\ncheer, we all set off slowly towards Westminster,\npeople joining us from all directions of the park. One\ncouldn't help but grin at the sheer weight of feeling\nin the air, people protesting as far as the eye could\nsee. The atmosphere of a carnival was all pervading;\ndoberman s in Anti-Poll Tax T shirts, one guy dressed\nas Maggie seemingly oblivious to the jovial hatred\ndirected at him. It was going to be a fun day out with\na purpose.\nAs the march traipsed towards the river so the\nsinging and dancing increased, passing drivers hooting\nin support, as the houses of Parliament came into view\nso the crowd hissed and booed, venting their anger\nat the perpetrators of such an unjust tax. As we\ncrossed Parliament square into Whitehall we could see\nthe sea of people ahead of us massing in Trafalgar\nSquare and what looked like a great ending to a wonderful day. However it was not to be.\nAs we approached the entrance to Downing Street\nthe march was forced to a halt by a huge Police\npresence. Channeling us away from the massive\nsecurity gate and the masses of backup police behind\nthem. These gates seemed to symbolize how the\ngovernment is. We have been bred into a trap: pay\nup or go to jail. We don't care, Conservative voters\npay their Poll Tax. We could gradually feel an ugliness\nin the air, face to face confrontations with the Police\nseemed to inflame both sides. News filtered down the\nmarch that a sit down protest had started occurring\nand the Police had split the march in two.\nSuddenly the Police cordon hemming us onto the\npavement fell back in a great wave and we swarmed\nacross the street. A great cheer went up, it seemed\nsuddenly as though we had won . Even before\nanything had been thrown, a feeling of battle was\neverywhere. People started chanting 'Maggie\nThatchers boot boys' and 'you've got to fight for your\nrights.' It was extremely tense further towards the\nPolice cordon. They started to syphon the marchers\nwho hadn't made it to the square down Horse Guards\nParade, towards the river with the somewhat false\npromise of a rally in Hyde Park.\nThe atmosphere seemed to improve as people\nslowly and reluctantly dispersed. I wasn't going to\nmiss the rally so I worked my way around Scotland\nYard and walked through the Police line stopping\npeople leaving the square. A lot of people had\nmanaged to get there as it was full. At the time\neveryone was milling around, chatting and singing.\nThe speeches having finished, I walked around ,met\na few friends. A peaceful time.was being had by all.\nSuddenly a shout went up from the South side of\nthe square. I was pushed back by a wave of people,\npanicking at the first Police charge. Now fully kit ted out in riot gear, how could a child and pushchair be\nany match against this?\nChaos and madness ensued as the Police repeatedly\ncharged. The crowd started throwing any object they\ncould lay their hands on; traffic cones, sticks, and\nplacards. As the Police charged towards the\nscaffolding, their aim to bring people down, so the rain\nof missiles erupted further, scaffold poles, concrete.\nThe Police were beaten back at first but then they\ncharged with horses, carving a swath through the\nfrightened crowd towards St Martins Lane. Smoke\nbegan to billow from the contractors building, perched\nover the square.\nHow could this be London 1990? It felt like Vietnam\n1970: sirens, screaming, the smoke drifting over the\nsquare, the road littered with missiles, and a dangerous feeling of pure panic. Camera crews were\nrunning all over the place, Police vans were careering\nin and out of the square. A Policewomen was hit by\na steel bracket and staggered off bleeding, a group\ncarrying an unconscious woman, trampled by the\nhorses, was carried to safety. Why was this\nhappening? History was repeating itself, the Poll Tax\nriots of 1381 ended in a similar way!\nWe were herded like animals down Northumberland\nAvenue. The crush was unbearable, cries of\nHillsborough, Hillsborough' filled the air as we were\npushed against the buildings. A girl in front of me was\nhit by a truncheon and called a slag. How can I be\nexpected to ever respect a Policeman again? If these\nare the lengths the Government will go to to impose\ntheir will on us, then God help this country.\nA feeling of shock emerged as we reached the\nEmbankment. Shock and anger at having witnessed\nsuch unwarranted violence, violence against the\nPolice and violence against the majority who were\npeacefully opposing. It shouldn't and need n't have\nhappened. Democracy is dead. Long live democracy.\nPage 37\n\n"

    "content": "Mass, International Resque + Carter T.U.S. M. Oxford venue 8.6.90\nMass were thrash, had two fans and sounded like lots\nof other bands, though not as good. A safe option for\nan enjoyable first support band. It's a shame, but as\nlong as they play like a first support band they will\nprogress no further.\nInternational Resque were confused. They were a scally band who got wise and decided they needed\na new sound. They collected a host of 'successful\nindie' records and copied the style of each one in turn\nincluding sounds of Ned's Atomic Dustbin, Snuff,\nMega City 4, Mudhoney and whatever else it seemed\nthey could lay their hands on. They even kept their\nBez for posterity, who danced aimlessly with a 'DANCE' placard clutched before him. Good as a support band but they had nothing new to offer.\nWhereas Carter hit the stage and changed\neverything: the crowd suddenly livened up. They\nstarted with Rubbish the single and bounded through\ntheir standard set, although spiced up with covers of\nPet Shop Boys Rent and the non - album tracks RSPC\nEverything and the alcoholics song Anytime,\nAnyplace, Anywhere.\nThe footballs flew, as is becoming commonplace\nwith Carter sets; the crowd leapt, danced and\nstage dived as is also common at Carter gigs.\nAfter the cataclysmic Perfect Day to Drop Bomb\nthey left, though soon they were shouted back into\nan encore, including Alternative Alf Garnett and\nGeneration X's King Rocker. They left again and the\npolice were going to come and arrest us all, so they\nteased. The lights came on but still the shouts did not\nabate. Some people left, but those who had the\npatience to hang around were rewarded with another\nencore 'because the police liked them'. They finally\ndrained us with a song which shouts 'everybody's happy now' and dies to the screams of 'don't pay the\npoll tax, don't pay the poll tax.' What fun.\nDEL\nMind Over Four\n- The Goddess LP\nHave this band nicked every idea from another group?\nWell perhaps not on the A side anyway. Set in the\ntraditional mould of heavy metal, with hard beats and\nincomprehensible lyrics, this band goes too far. The\nalbum starts well with Prayer For The Dying, a lively\nsong with good vocals and music. It's a shame they\ndon't last until the end of the song. Next, the title track\nis better - heavier but more mumbled. Then the album\ngoes downhill, with two tracks that sound slightly\nraw, with words that mean nothing and convey even\nless. Post however, picks the A side off the floor with\nclearer singing and com pet ant music.\nThe B side makes it all worthwhile, probably\nbecause here the band sound like much more well\nknown groups. In fact the first two songs reminded\nme of Powerslave sung badly. The apex of the record\nmust be Autumn's Here which starts slowly before\ncrashing into heavy bass guitar. This is what they're\ngood at. The euphoria doesn't last, as we are\nsubjected to Hell's Bravest Song with some awful\nsinging. Luckily the group recover with Airplanes;\nslow and heavy, it's obviously their forte.\nAfter a few playing s,I started to get into this album.\nThis wasn't difficult as, at 34 minutes for ten songs,\nit's really quite short. Reading the lyrics on the sleeve\n(you can't understand them otherwise), I found that\nthey const s ted of half formed sentences concerned\nmainly with the death of friends and mortality. A promising band dragged down by meaningless lyrics.\nToby Jones.\nPage 6\nCarter The Unstoppable\nSex Machine\n-Rubbish 12\"\nCarter are both excellent on record and a manic ally brilliant live band, so when they take a live favorite\nRubbish and put it onto vinyl it seems disappointingly\ntame. Carter have better songs, so this should have\nremained a live classic. But if you haven't heard it live,\nit's fab.\nThe Pet Shop Boys Rent is ritually livened up on the\nB side followed by Alternative Alf Garnett, an ironic\nsing along classic; each verse finds something\ndifferent about today's fucked up society and ends\nwith a joyous 'if you're happy and you know it clap\nyou hands'.\nA perfect taste of Carter the Unstoppable Sex\nMachine.\nDEL\nt. Af. KB52's Cosmic Thing LP\nThe B52s, after only one major chart success have\nproduced a commercial album to catch and hold the\ninterest given by the single Love Shack. Where their\nprevious albums were much more limited in their\nappeal, with only a few good tracks, this album has\nhit commercial reality and necessity on the head to\ngive an ever successful 'reliable' album. The album\nis very much in the same frame of mind as Love\nShack, mindless fun, but a few tracks, as ever, stand\nout above the rest.\nThe Number One Love Shack, is a classic, a Tainted\nLove for the nineties. Roam, the present single, is a catchy tune: you will find yourself singing along\nwithout hardly noticing it. ChannelZ is full of classic\nB52s madness, zest and energy.

Revolver is targeted at people from\ntheir mid-teens to their twenties and it walks the\nmid ground between the other two Fleetway\npublications, not as realistic as Crisis but not as\nfantastic as 2000AD. The first issue contains seven\ndifferent strips in its 52 pages.\nPurple Days is the most Crisis-Wke of the strips,\nbased on the life story of Jimmi Hendrix. The story\nis not told chronologically, but leaps around different\ntimes in his life, making odd connections to try and\ndescribe the influences that formed his life.\nDare is a new version of that old favorite Dan Dare,\nPilot Of The Future. 'Old' is the word, as he is in\nretirement, manipulated for advertising and receiving\nnews of the suicide of an old friend Jocelyn Peabody.\nDrawn in a simple stylised fashion, as opposed to the\nPage 20\nvery childish for someone approaching 25 years of\nage-maybe the result of being the youngest and\nliving all her life in a small southern town.\nElain seems to be very concerned about her sister\nand willing to do all she can to help. She announces\nthat she has left her husband who adores her but\nwhom she seems to despise. But she does like the\nstyle of life which money can buy...\nDelmount is very fond of his young cousin but\ncannot understand why this contest means so much\nto Cannelle. He is given to philo soph ising and is\ndisgusted with many things in the world, including\nbeauty contests.\nThe film is fairly good at character is ation, the appeal\nof the character of Cannelle is her childishness but\nsometimes it can get a little irritating. The characters\nare unusual, in fact there is not a little carica tur is ation in some of them-Popeye hears voices through her\neyes, Aunt Ronelle had her pituitary gland replaced\nby that of a monkey's and long hair sprouted all over\nher body.\nAt times the film seems to drag and you find\nyourself wondering about more interesting aspects of\nthe story than this beauty contest. Having said that\nMiss Firecracker is partially redeemed by an excellent\nending and if a light evening's entertainment is all\nyou're looking for then this may do.\nJ L Wright.\nbeautiful painted artwork of Purple Days, at this early\nstage all that can be said is intriguing...\nPinhead Nation is a bizarre two page spread, based\non the news stories telling of pinhead aliens landing\nin Russia.\nHappenstance and Kismet tells of the meeting\nbetween Lucius Kismet and Monty Happenstance in\na pub in a tale involving deeds, space warps and\nludicrous volumes of alcohol.\nRogan Gosh tells of a Karmanaut tricked by the\nSoma Swami and forced to reincarnate himself as a curry about to be consumed by a lager lout. Probably\nmakes more sense if read when stoned.\nDire Streets is all about life in a student flat. Includes\nthe immortal line 'Well...it was nothing...its\njust...well..he says I 've given him The Clap!'\nNine Inches to The Mile takes us on a guided tour\nof the structure of the Universe. Totally weird and\nbound to annoy physicists.\nAlthough its large number of short strips gives a slightly disjointed feel to Revolver, it is a worthy\naddition to the marketplace and goes a step further\nin creating a new mainstream for comics away from\nthe super heroic antics of DC/Marvel.\nMarvel UK have also launched a new comic - The\nKnights of Pendragon. Basically a spin off from a Marvel US comic Excalibur, set in Britain, it lifts\nseveral of the main characters (Captain Britain,\nCommander Dai Thomas, CID and Alysande and\nAlistaire Stuart of Her Majesty's Weird Happenings\nOrganisation (WHO).\nThe story is an ecologically based one, with\nenvironmentally unfriendly people being brutally\nmurdered, a whaler torn to death with a harpoon and\npeople choking to death on Hamburgers. The\npublishers have even tried to prove their green\ncredibility by printing it on Scangloss, a paper which\nuses half as many trees and needs less chlorine\nbleaching than normal paper.\nIts well written with some great one-liners - 'I 've\nflown all the way from Wales, into a strong headwind,\nwithout a plane, so don't annoy me.' although\noccasionally the environmental message is laid on a bit thick. It fits in nicely with the style of Excalibur,\nwith Dai Thomas dwelling on the death of his wife.\nGary Erskine's pencils are good, capturing the\ncharacters well, making good use of visual humour\nand the Alan Davis cover were a nice touch. The\nCaptain Britain link is so tenuous one suspects that\nit is solely there to guarantee sales in the US. The plot\nis left sufficiently obscure to leave one keen to buy\nthe next issue. Well worth a look.\nRevolver and. The Knights of Pendragon are both\navailable now in Newsagents and specialty comic\nshops.\nAdam T. "

The meeting, which lasted\ntwo hours, covered a wide range of issues including\nthe need for a new hall of residence, better sports\nfacilities, local improvements and problems with the\nCollege day nursery.\nThe College was represented Caroline Fox of\nRegistry and John Finley, the warden of Beit Hall\nand an unsuccessful candidate in the local elections.\nImperial College Union was represented by President\nNeil McCluskey and Tom Yates, one of the organisers\nof the Imperial College local election campaign. They\nmet with Knightsbridge councilors Robert Michaels\nand Robert Moreland. Mr McCluskey and Ms Fox\nare now putting together a joint plan to be submitted\nto the council.\nCouncillor Michaels also asked about the arts at\nIC. According to Mr Yates, this came as a surprise\nto everyone: he claimed to have been 'gob smacked' but believes that it may be possible for the College\nOrchestra to obtain a grant to invite a professional\nstring quartet to give lessons. He is looking for similar\nproposals from other art orientated societies.\nThe meeting fulfilled an promise made during the\nlocal elections, the first to be fought by Imperial\nCollege candidates.

Mr McCluskey presented a proposal\nto make ICU president a member of MPG at a meeting\nof Governing Body held on Tuesday 12th June. This\nproposal was rejected.\nSerpentine\ndanger\nWarning signs have been erected around the\nSerpentine in Hyde Park after traces of potentially\ntoxic blue-green algae were found.

The robbery took place\nbetween 8 and 10pm. The thief was not caught.\nAnother opportunist thief, who is believed to have\nbeen stealing from Imperial College earlier this year,\nhas been arrested after trying to rob students at City\nUniversity. It was the second time that the man had\nbeen caught at the University. On the first time cheque\nbooks belonging to IC students were recovered but\nthe man escaped before the police arrived.\nHe was arrested after being recognised when he\nreturned to the site for a second time last Thursday.\nHe subsequently admitted a dozen offences. IC Chief\nSecurity Officer, Geoff Reeves, told FELIX 'we've\ngot him bang to rights.'\nPownall\ntaken ill\nRoger Pownall, the College Bars' Manager, was\nrushed to hospital last Thursday morning suffering\nfrom heart trouble. Mr Pownall is 36 and, prior to\nthe incident, had been very active. The news has\nshocked his many friends at college.\nMr Pownall first felt ill while resting in his flat.\nHe phoned for an ambulance and was admitted to\nhospital by 10 am with his heart beating at twice the\nnormal rate. Rob Northey, Catering and Conferences\nmanager who is Mr Pownall's boss, visited him last\nThursday night. 'Roger was alright,' Mr Northey\nsaid, 'he was bored with having to read his newspaper\nsix times.'\nThe hospital requested that Mr Pownall stay in the\nCoronary Unit while tests were carried out and he\nwas discharged the following day. He has gone to\nthe West Midlands to recover and is expected back\nnext week.\nChem Eng\npay up\nThe Chemical Engineering department has finally paid\nthe \u00a3150 it owed to the college for damage done at\nFebruary's Chemical Engineering annual dinner.\nProfessor Wakeham, the head of department, said that\nthe delay was due to problems getting the Chemical\nEngineering Society and the City and Guilds Union\nto pay their share.\nBarbecue\ncurse\nThe curse of the Barbecue continues.

It saw the FELIX editor\ndescribing the Rector as a 'conniving g it' and a union\nelection being won by a cartoon. In short, a lot has\nhappened.\nThe storm which swept across Southern England\nin late January caused \u00a310,000 worth of damage to\nthe College. Winds in excess of 100 miles per hour,\ntore branches from trees and ripped slates from roofs.\nIn one incident, a lump of lead six foot by two, blown\noff the Union Building, landed near the Albert Hall. In\nthe country as a whole, the storm claimed more than\ntwenty lives.\naccommodation. The College denied everything then\npromptly made a number of improvements.\nAnyone entering the FELIX office in mid November\nwas likely to be dragged across the room and forced\nto look at pictures of 'Ample Annie.' This, and other\n'interesting' research material went to make the\ninfamous pornography issue, another stage in Dave\nSmedley's campaign to become the most offensive\nFELIX editor in history.\nAs far as Professor Richards, the Dean of St. Mary's was concerned, he had been 100% successful.\nProfessor Richards rounded up every copy of FELIX\nsent to the Paddington site and consigned the lot to\nthe bin, earning himself the title of Mary's( twice), the sports centre and assorted halls of\nresidence, relieving them of tens of thousand pounds\nworth of cash, cheques and equipment. One\nenterprising criminal obtained a television by falsely\nclaiming it as a raffle prize.\nSecurity has been lax. On one night in mid February,\ntwo students in the guise of the 'Pink Panther\nSociety', set out to prove how insecure the Union\nBuilding was. The students, Doug King and Mylan\nLester, broke into various rooms within the building\nand plastered them with posters proclaiming their\npresence. The two were subsequently interviewed by\nthe constabulary but not charged.\nAnother group to find themselves entangled with\nIn October, a student suffering from malaria was\nkept waiting for medical assistance for over three\nhours following a breakdown in communications\nwithin the College Health Service. It took almost an\nhour to contact Tessa Addenbrooke, the doctor on\nduty and a further three hours before she turned up.\nBy this time, the student had already been taken to\nhospital. Dr Addenbrooke had initially decided that the\ncase was not serious enough to warrant her attention.\nThe student recovered quickly and was released\nfrom hospital within a few days. The affair was,\naccording to Ranaan Gillan, the Director of the College\nHeath Service, a very definite 'cock up.'\nThe issue of health reared its sickly head again at\nthe end of the spring term when FELIX run a story\nheadlined 'Day Nursery is a Health Hazard.' The story\nalleged that the children in the College run nursery\nwere being kept in damp, mouldy and dangerous\nPage 12\nWhitehouse. Other would be members of the moral\nmajority were equally annoyed. One, when told that\nthe cover was deliberately printed so that the pictures\nwere faint, is alleged to have replied 'Yes, but if you\nlook really close...'\nPlaces like this attract a certain type of tourist. Over\nthe year, Imperial College received a number of visits\nfrom the great and the good. Margaret Thatcher also\npopped in, as did her South Korean counterpart, Roh\nTae Woo while the Royals were represented by\nPrincess Anne. There are also reports of a flying tour\nby an obscure and irrelevant Scotsman believed to be\nthe Education Secretary.\nCRIME AND PUNISHMENT\nIt has been a bad year for theft. The criminal element\nhave visited, among others, the Radio Ham Society,\nthe Rugby club, the Union Office, the Union Bar\nthe law were the Afro-Caribbean society (Afroc). Their\ndisco held in the JCR, was stopped early after reports\nof violence and 'professional' drug peddling. After this\nfiasco, the college decided to ban the society from\nholding further events on college premises and\ninformed the Students Union of this fact.\nUnfortunately, the Union did not get round to telling\nAfroc until ten days before their next planned event.\nThe event, a Jazz night, had to be cancelled, a cancellation which cost the Union \u00a3 1200 in publicity\nand bands' fees. Afroc chairman, David Cornwall,\nthreatened the Union officer responsible for the delay,\nDeputy President Dave Williams, with legal action.\nm peri al College has a reputation for drunken and\nboorish behaviour, a reputation which the Chemical\nEngineering Department and the Southwell drinking\nclub, the Diggers, both tried to live up to.\nStudents AND staff at the Chemical Engineering\nrial College 1989/90\nDepartmental Dinner behaved in what was de sci bed as a 'compromising manner' in front of their guest\nspeaker. A spokeswoman for the Chemical\nEngineering Society told FELIX 'I didn't enjoy the\nevening as much as last year.' The later Diggers do\nculminated in someone urinating over the table and\na \u00a3100 bill for broken crockery.\nEarlier in the year, a student was taken to hospital\nfollowing a fight in the Union bar. The three students\ninvolved were taken before the College Disciplinary\nCommittee but escaped criminal prosecution. The\nUnion now has a policy of calling in the Police in the\nevent of a disturbance.\nOne person who did not avoid the courts was\nformer FELIX editor Bill Goodwin. Bill started a new\ncareer as a cause celebr e after he refused to reveal\na source. He subsequently featured in court cases as\nhigh up as the House of Lords, the BBC Nine o 'clock\nNews, a number of newspaper editorials and the\n'Megalomedia' cartoon strip in the Guardian. This did\nnot, however, stop him being found guilty and fined\n\u00a35000.\nTHE CONNIVING GITS\nProfessor Eric Ash, the Rector of Imperial College,\nreceived two prestigious accolades during the year.\nIn January, HRH the Queen tapped him on the\nshoulder with an offensive weapon magically\ntransforming him into Sir Eric. Earlier, in October,\nFELIX Editor Dave Smedley awarded him the FELIX\n'conniving g it' award over his reaction to events in\nChina. He went on to win it another twice more.\nThe Tiananmen Square massacre last year shocked\nmany people, not least IC's large Chinese community.\nThese students found themselves badly out of pocket\nafter spending over \u00a32000 on contacting relatives and\nsending messages of support. IC Union agreed to help\nfinance this and was eventually presented with a bill\nfor \u00a3470. The soon-to-be Sir Eric sent just \u00a3200. Neil\nMcCluskey, ICU president, had expected the Rector\nto provide the difference and it was felt in some\nquarters that Professor Ash had been pandering to the\nChinese regime. The College is always reluctant to\nlose overseas student fees.\nIn November, Sir Eric was joined in Sherfield by the\nCollege's new Managing Director, Angus Fraser. Mr\nFraser, who had worked extensively in Industry before\ncoming to IC, took over from retiring College Secretary\nJohn Smith and quickly undertook a shake up of the\nCollege Bureaucracy which left some people very\nshaken indeed.\nThere was much conniving in the epic saga of the\nBookstore. The Bookstore, which used to be owned\njointly by the Student's Union and the College, was\ntransferred wholly to the Union during the Summer\nand left in the hands of Dave Peacock, the Union\nManager. The first FELIX of the year (18th August)\ncarried the report of his discovery that, because of a huge out-of-date book stockpile, the Bookstore was\n\u00a375 000 further in the red than had previously been\nthought.\nThe following week, Dave received another nasty\nsurprise when, after the Union had refurbished the\nshop, the college quadrupled the rent. It took a month\nof negotiations to persuade them to back down. In the\nfollowing six months, the Bookstore made a profit of\n\u00a336000, all of which went back to the Union.\nThe next target for 'rational is ation' was the Careers\nAdvisory Service (CAS). Sir Eric has de sci bed the CAS\nas 'over funded and over-resourced' and, in recent\nyears, its budget had been slashed. One member of\nstaff had already had to stop finding jobs for students\nand start finding a job for herself. Another was in\ndanger of following her, leaving the CAS with just one\nfull time member of staff. Sir Eric had planned that\nthe service would be run by postgraduates working\npart time. Unfortunately for the good knight, the FELIX\nconniving affairs correspondent heard about his plans\nand promptly printed them on the front page.\nICU stepped in, agreeing to pay for a part time\ncareers advisor and a compromise was reached. The\nservice will now employ two full time staff members\nwith postgraduate assistants. Russ Clark, College\nCareers Officer, said 'we're not entirely happy with\nthe situation but we'll have to live with it.'\nCollege and Union clashed again over the Harlington\nsports ground. To raise money, the sports ground\nitself is being steadily dug up for gravel extraction, the\nextra cash going into a trust fund. In December, the\ntrust administrators had agreed that the trust money\nshould go towards new sporting facilities including an\nastroturf pitch.\nIt was a this point that Sir Eric and Angus Fraser\narrived with an alternative plan. The money was to\nbe taken from the Union and spent on a new hall of\nresidence. Unfortunately, the Rector's plan was\nrejected by everyone from the Union President to the\ngrounds trustees. Sir Eric retaliated by suggesting that\nthere should be a referendum to let the students\ndecide. This never happened and there is still no sign\nof the astroturf - no score draw.\nPrivate sector scheming thrived at Imperial\nBiotechnology (IBT). IBT, formerly part of the college,\nwas sold to an Austrailian firm last year. In January,\nthe new owners decided that the enterprise was too\ncostly and threatened to cut seven staff. The IC trade\nunions did not take kindly to this, and took industrial\naction.\nStudents and hall wardens too found themselves\nat odds with the conniving classes. A little under two\nyears ago, it was decided to set up an extra security\nlodge at one of the entrances to the Southside Halls.\nEighteen months later, it was decided that this was\ntoo expensive. Three months after this, it was decided\nit wasn't. Southside is promised its security lodge\n'soon'. Meanwhile, the thefts continued.\nThat is not to say that, when they tried, the college\ncould not keep people out of the halls. Among the\npeople locked out of Southside this year was the\nwarden, Dr John Hassard. Dr Hassard fell victim to\nan ingenious security scheme in which the locks on\nthe hall are changed yearly. The scheme would have\nworked if someone had not handed out the wrong\nkeys.\nPage 13\n\n"

    "content": "Conniving Git?\nDave Smedley's year as FELIX Editor has made him\nthe most infamous of all the sabbaticals. Most of you\nwill have already dissected his character from the\ncontents of his FELICES, while never meeting the man\nhimself. But is this fair? Is Dave really vindictive and\nscheming, devoid of morality? Well...\nLike many before him, his editorship followed a year\nas news editor, one of the most tort u rous of tasks\nknown to man. After three years at IC playing in the\nPhysics department, the stress was beginning to swell\nand showed in the cigarette intake. Like a genie from\nthe Arabian Nights, Dave always appears in a puff of\nsmoke.\nThroughout the year this has not improved, despite\nthe appearance of a subtle 'No Smoking please' sign\nin the typesetting area. Indeed, there is trouble in the\nair if you catch him without a fag in his mouth.\nMaybe one of these troubled periods preceded the\nValentines edition of Broadsheet, for which he was\neditor at the time. Was it produced AO or A6 size? No.\nIt came out in heart shaped format and his name has\nbeen mud ever since.\nSpeaking of Valentines, Dave has been the first\nFELIX editor in a long time who has led a covert\nrelationship for the better part of the year. The identity\nof Smedder's sweetheart remains a mystery to this\nvery day. Indeed, clues as to the existence of such\na relationship have been few and far between.\nPerhaps the largest one was uncovered by one of the\nsabbatical candidates back in March. Knocking on the\ndoor of Dave's penthouse love-nest in Selkirk Hall, the\nprospective President heard much groaning and\nmoaning coming from within. Mr Smedley eventually\nanswered the door looking most disheveled claiming\nthat the noise had been a steamy item on television.\nA cursory glance at the TV Times reveals that\ntele visual delight was none other than Coronation\nStreet.\nHis degree of contempt and disillusionment\nconcerning the Union and the College has not grown\nsince taking office, because it was bad enough\nalready! In that light he has been firm but fair in his\nreporting of the cock-ups that always abound. His\nhate of committees is paralleled only with his hate of\nDave Williams.\nA frustrated photographer, bitter after losing his\nartwork from school, he had his big break during the\nsummer. Mrs Thatcher deigned to grace IC with her\npresence, but Dave lost his nerve. Shooting from the\nhip, he didn't realise that he had left his Colt 45 in the\noffice and mistakenly picked up his OM 10 instead.\nThe result, a blurred photograph and the continuation\nof the UK under tyranny. Yes Dave is the man\nresponsible for the state of edu kay shun that resides\ntoday.\nDave could be described as a man with a rapier wit\nbut only if the rapier concerned was poison tipped.\nEvery editor has his own preoccupations: his was to\nwind up as many people as possible.\nThis included the staff. Dave's idea of a deadline\nfor a4000 word article is 'anytime within the next\nten minutes.' Many a staff member has been spotted\nhopping around the room, gibbering after being given\nseven pages to write.\nThe formation of the 'conniving g it' award in his\nFreshers issue marked the advent of subtle criticism\nfor the year. The recipient, the then non-Sir Eric Ash,\nthe rector, made no comment, until it was pointed out\nto him several weeks later. Though cringing at each\nletter that Sir Eric sent, he played fair and included\nthem in the letters page for our amusement.\n\u2014\n\u20220 mm\nMost editors go through a frantic stage (for this to\nbe put in perspective take your definition of frantic,\nadd it to the News editors view of frantic, multiply by\n10 and you're about half way there). In many it\ninspires complete lunacy, schizophrenia, paranoia and\ndelusions of grandeur (George the III style). The final\nstraw in Dave's case was the photo-story 'A Fistful\nof Parking Permits'. After a postponement of two\nweeks and then a couple of all-night developing and\npaste-up sessions it was all too much. But for Dave\nnone of the tell tale signs became apparent.\nThe bubble did burst though and from it was born\nthe Pornography special. 'Are You Feeling Yourself\nToday' asked the front cover. 'Piss off said the Dean\nof St.Mary's, Professor Richards, in a move that\ncondemned 500 copies of FELIX to incineration.\nDave was not happy. A feature with a message and\na serious approach became the most controversial\nproduct out of the FELIX stables. Though inflaming\nthe outspoken and misguided views of a number of\ngroups in college it was also the most sought after.\nPeople came in from miles around to obtain a copy\nof the one they missed. 'Excuse me, but I don't seem\nto have a copy of Issue 850, have you got any left?'.\nAce columnist, and Dave's collaborator in many\ndodge y scams, Paul Shanley, took as much an\nexception to the sacrificial burning as Dave. In a move\ndesigned to bring Dr Richards back to earth with his\ntail between his legs, Shan phoned first Private Eye\nand then some newspapers, including the Evening\nStandard. His ignorance of this newspaper was his\ndownfall as the story they gave was mis-quoted and\nturned on it's head. The faxing of the cover, which\nhad been printed in a subdued hue of orange to limit\nimage definition, produced a sharp black and white\ncopy for inspection. This revealed quite unashamedly\none of the biggest orgies since Roman times. Dave\ninstantly denied encouraging Mr Shanley in this\nventure when the paper came out the next day, but\nwe know better.\n\u2014\nJ Not content with the volume of letters from readers,\nanother controversial issue was explored. 'Thatcher's Girls', a feature on prostitution in issue 868, gave the\nbare facts on an issue that is ever contemporary in\na world of ever changing values. This cheap ploy failed\nto work, spawning only a few letters, less in fact than\nan ordinary book review in the same issue (giving\nDave something else to rant about).\nHowever, the effect was more pronounced than\nfirst appeared. Dave began walking around all the local\nphone boxes. Now the research was over he knew\nexactly what to write on his sticky labels to attract\nthe punters.\nDave encouraged the works of Dave Peacock, the\nUnion Business Manager, and Ian Richards, the Snack\nBar Manager. The Union office let him get away with\ndoing the job he was doing, despite wanting a PR man\nand not so much of a newspaper man. They did\nhowever realise, far behind the FELIX staff and the\nreligious societies, that Dave was the Anti-Christ. This\nshocking revelation came after the news that nobody\nin the Union office was working at all. In fact they had\nall been on holiday in Barbados at a wedding. In all\nhonesty, how could this be true? Such a thought was\nunheard of, well, unspoken up until now anyway.\nAll was sorted out in over zealous celebration at the\nPresident's Dinner. Hugs and kisses on the central\nstaircase of the Union were much in evidence (\u00a310\nor we publish the photographs).\nThe one major fault in this year's FELIX is the lack\nof proof reading in certain Sci Fi Soc articles and the\nWhat's On page, allowing mistakes like PRICKOCON\nto slip through.\nAt this point Dave would like us to say: the last year\nhas been great and Dave has kept everyone on their\ntoes. He's been the most professional and\norganised of the editors we've worked with. A good\nfriend aY id an inspiration for us all.\nIs that OK Dave, do we get our money now?\nPage 83\n\n"

    "content": "Ian Hodge reveals how little freedom of information we enjoy in Britain...\nSecret society\nInformation is power. If you can control the flow of\ninformation you have the ultimate power. The society\nthat we live in is one where people are given\ninformation on a 'need to know', not a 'want to know'\nbasis. There are many ways in which the present\ngovernment continues to maintain a society where\ninformation is a highly valued commodity.\nThe Official Secrets act.\nIntroduced in 1911, it was rushed through parliament\nin half an hour with the threat of war hanging over\nthe heads of the British population. The act has one\nmajor flaw: Section Two.\nDescribed as a 'catch all' provision, section 2 makes\nthe disclosure of classified information by a civil\nservant, an offence. The crime is punishable by a sentence of up to two years and/or a fine.\nThe act has many weaknesses:\n\u2022 It is does not distinguish between the important and\nthe trivial. The plans for the latest fighter plane are\ntreated with the same level of secrecy as the number\nof sugars the Prime Minister has in her tea.\n\u2022 Once the information has been disclosed it is an\noffence to pass it on to anybody else. Printing the\ninformation in a newspaper or passing it on to\nanybody by word of mouth is illegal. The classic case\nis the 'Spycatcher' affair.\n\u2022 Anyone who receives information that is covered\nby the act is committing an offence, unless they can\nprove that it was given to them against their wishes.\n\u2022 Most farcical of all, it is illegal to knowingly allow\npeople to hand over information covered by the act\non your land.\nUnder the Official Secrets Act, the Government may\ndecide what is classified information and prosecute\nthose who disagree with them.\nReform.\nIn 1989 the then Home Secretary, Douglas Hurd, put\nforward a white paper in a bid to correct some of the\nfaults in the original act.\nNow, the Government has to prove that actual harm\nwill be caused to 'National Security,' by a disclosure.\nThe government claims that the changes have\nremoved the cases where people were liable for\nprosecution for revealing irrelevant or meaningless\ninformation. This rarely happened with the original\nact. The new version is merely window dressing; it\nmakes no real attempt to promote freedom of\ninformation.\nThere are several areas that the white paper\ncompletely fails to address:\n\u2022 If a senior civil servant or a member of parliament\nbreaks the law or is incompetent in their job it is illegal\nfor anybody to reveal the fact even though it is clearly\nin the public interest.\n\u2022 What makes information harmful? The act's definition of harm is hazy. All that is required is for\nthere to be a danger of harm being done to the state.\nIt does not specify what it means by 'harm'. What is\n'National Security?' The security of the people or of\nthe government in power?\n\u2022 Certain categories of information do not require any\nproof of harm. Indeed, the courts are forced to ignore\nany evidence that harm has not been done.\nPage 56\nFamous Prosecutions under the official\nsecrets include:\n1977: Duncan Campbell and Crispin Aubrey\ninterviewed ex-soldier John Berry. They were\nprosecuted and convicted for receiving information\neven though the government had expressed its\nintention to alter section two so that receiving\ninformation was not an offence.\nThe soldier received a6 month sentence while the\ntwo journalists were both conditionally discharged and\nordered to pay costs.\n1984: Sarah Tisdall, a clerk in the Foreign Secretary's private office, was convicted for revealing information\nabout the arrival of cruise missiles at Greenham\nCommon. During the prosecution it was\nacknowledged that no harm had been caused by the\ndisclosure but, without the promised alterations to the\nact, she was given a sentence of 6 months.\n1984: Clive Ponting, a senior civil servant in the\nMinistry of Defence, was prosecuted for revealing\ninformation about the sinking of the 'General\nBelgrano' during the Falklands conflict. The defence\nargued that the disclosure was in the public interest.\nThe jury agreed with the defence and rejected the\njudge's comments that the 'national interest' was\nequivalent to the self-interest of the government of\nthe day. He was unanimously acquitted, and was later\nto achieve notoriety within the civil service through\nthe slang term 'to pont,' meaning to leak information.\nThe Data Protection Act.\nSince November 11th1987 you have had the right\nto see data held about you on any computer system.\nThe act is a major advance towards freedom of\ninformation but falls well short of what is required.\nThere are still wide ranges of data that you are not\nallowed to see:\n1. Data which has been designated National Security\nInformation. This means that any information that the\ngovernment wants to keep quiet can be classified as\n'National Security Information', making it an offence\nto reveal it.\n2. Criminal records.\n3. Data held purely for payroll purposes.\n4. A credit reference, since you can gain access using\nthe Consumer Credit Act, 1974.\n5. Medical records, except when it is considered to\nbe in the patient's interest.\nHow to gain access.\nTo get a copy of the information that a company holds\nabout you you must write to them, giving sufficient\ndetail for them to be able to identify you and for you\nto prove your identity. They must provide the\ninformation that you require within forty days or give\na reason for being unable to do so. There are several\nreasons why data might be withheld:\n\u2022 Giving you the information would make them liable\nfor prosecution under another act.\nOR\n\n"

    "content": "An alcoholic is a person for whom one drink is too many and a hundred is not enough. Liz\nWarren explains why and investigates the incidence of alcoholism at Imperial College.\nIt could be you.\nThere are probably between 350 and 400 students\nat Imperial College who are alcoholics. This is about\nsix percent of the student population, or more than\none in twenty. Think about it: it's over ten people in\neach year of Physics, four per year in a course like\nAeronautics. And that's just if you consider the\nnational average. With its culture of excessive\ndrinking, Imperial perhaps has even more heavy\ndrinkers than average and that might mean more\nalcoholics.\nWhat is an alcoholic?\nConsider the popular conception of an alcoholic. It is\nthe sad old man sleeping in his cardboard box at\nLincoln's Inn Fields, clutching his bottle of cheap\nsherry bought with this week's giro. Or it is the errant\ngenius liberally dosing his wit and brilliance while he\neither squanders his talents or produces a masterpiece.\nThe truth is that he, or indeed she, is more likely\nto be your doctor, your bank manager, perhaps your\nbrother or your best friend, or the person sitting next\nto you in the lecture theatre. Or it could be you.\nAlcoholism is no respect er of age or class or sex or\nrace. You don't have to be rolling drunk from the\nmoment you wake up until you get thrown out of the\npub at closing time to be an alcoholic. You don't even\nhave to drink very much, although your chances of\ndeveloping alcohol related health problems are much\ngreater if you do.\nThere are different ideas about exactly what\nalcoholism is. Contrary to a popular misconception,\nwhich is hopefully dying out, alcoholics are not weak\nwilled people who drink because they have no moral\nfibre. Alcoholism is a disease, much like one of those\nother unmentionable diseases, cancer. It is a progressive illness: if an alcoholic goes on drinking,\nthey will become progressively worse. It is not a disease which can ever be fully cured, but it can be\narrested. Most alcoholics suffer from both a physical\ndependence or craving for alcohol and a mental\nobsession with their drinking.\nEach individual's drinking can be seen as one part\nof a continuum ranging from safe drinking to harmful\ndrinking. The alcoholic has crossed over a line where\nthey can no longer control their drinking and where\nit begins to affect the whole of their life. Drinking can\nlead to them losing their jobs, their friends and their\nfamilies. These are the roots of the popular image of\nan alcoholic: the down and out who has lost\neverything, except his desire to drink. Alcoholics do\nnot start as down and outs, they become that way\nbecause losing control of their drinking makes them\nlose control of their lives.\nAlcoholics are frequently in trouble with the police\nbecause of their actions when drunk, because they\nwill steal or cheat to obtain the next drink. Equally,\nalcoholics can spend years behaving to the outsider\nand even to those quite close to them as if they have\nno problem whatsoever.\nAlcoholism is also linked to many other diseases\nwhich are caused by excessive alcohol consumption,\nsuch as cirrhosis of the liver and high blood pressure.\nWomen, drinkers face an increased risk of cirrhosis\nof the liver, obesity , anaemia and malnutrition\ncompared to men. A study amongst UK Civil Servants\nTwenty key questions\nEach individual must decide for themselves whether they are an alcoholic. This can be meant in both\nthe sense of someone who is physically dependent on alcohol or someone who is not physically\ndependent but finds that drinking is adversely affecting their life. Alcoholics Anonymous have devised\na list of twenty questions which can help people decide if they have a problem.\n1. Is drinking making your home life unhappy?\n2. Does your drinking make you careless of your family's or friends' welfare?\n3. Have you ever tried to stop drinking for a week or so but only lasted for a couple of days?\n4. Is drinking affecting your reputation?\n5. Do you drink to escape from worries or trouble?\n6. Do you drink alone?\n7. Have you lost time from work due to drinking?\n8. Has your ambition decreased since drinking?\n9. Has your efficiency decreased since drinking?\n10. Is drinking jeo pardi sing your job or business?\n11. Have you ever felt remorse after drinking?\n12. Are you in financial difficulties as a result of drinking?\n13. Do you turn to or seek an inferior environment when drinking?\n14. Do you crave a drink at a definite time daily?\n15. Does drinking cause you to have difficulty sleeping?\n16. Do you want a drink the next morning?\n17. Do you drink to build up your self confidence?\n18. Have you ever had complete loss of memory as a result of drinking (blackouts)?\n19. Has your doctor ever treated you for drinking?\n20. Have you ever been in hospital or prison because of drinking?\nAdd up how many questions you answered yes to and turn over\nPage 31\n\n"

    "content": "Now we have some fine weather, why not take a break and go on a walk? Every week s eve run dozens of guided tours around London, each with its own attractions. Toby Jones decided\nof the most well known companies, City Walks.\nWalks in London\nCity Walks\nThe current programme continues unchanged until\nJanuary 31 1991. Note: No tours on December 24,\n25, 26, or January 1.\nAll walks are \u00a34 or \u00a33 to students, International\nYouth Hostel card holders and OAPs. A London Card\ncan be purchased for \u00a37 for two walks; \u00a37 for an all\nday ticket; \u00a312 for unlimited walks for two weeks or\n\u00a3 17 for unlimited walks for the whole year. City Walks\ncan be contacted on 071-937 4281.\nGhosts, Ghouls and Graveyards\nEvery night 9pm outside St Pauls Underground.\nEvery night a cheerful group sets out from St Pauls\nto be haunted with tales of mass burials, victims of\nthe plague and spirits that won't lie peacefully. I joined\nthe tour on a clear, cold Wednesday night with eleven\nothers. This was a medium sized group, sometimes\nthere are as many as sixty!\nWe started at St Pauls with a peaceful, ghostly\nclergyman, accidentally dispelled when a staircase,\nnot shown on any plan, was uncovered. Setting a good pace, we covered Deadman's walk, the last\nplace condemned men saw before being hanged; the\narea where they were cut up in aid of science (some\nnot quite dead!) and secluded courtyards and\ngraveyards where certain spirits roam in search of\nmissing clothing or limbs!\nTwo hours later we had over-run by fifteen minutes\nwith only a short stop in a pub to warm up. I was glad\nI'd wrapped up. Still, the lively commentary from an\nenthusiastic guide and a fairly brisk pace between\nMiddle Temple, once the headquarters for the powerful religious order of the Knights Templa\nfrequent stops kept us from freezing up altogether.\nI enjoyed this tour immensely and parted good friends\nfrom my fellow phantom-hunters.\nThe Royal Courts of Justice, which oddly lack the customary statue of 'Blind Justice.\nPage 50\nThe Original Hidden Interiors of Old London.\nEvery week-day 10.30am outside Temple Underground (except Apr 13, 16; May 7, 28; Aug 27; Dec\n24, 25, 26, 31; Jan 1 1991)\nAs a change from ghosts, I thought I would take a more factual walk. I almost didn't make it due to\ndelays on the Underground-a warning to set out in\ngood time, since many tours start promptly if there\nare enough people. This time, on a windy Friday, I had\nonly two companions plus guide but there can be up\nto thirty people.\nWe started in the grounds of the Middle Temple,\nonce the head quarters of the Knights Templar, now\none of the training centres for barristers. We were\ngiven a long talk on the history of the surrounding\nbuildings and how they came to be a law school.\nLuckily, the Middle Temple Hall was open, as was the\nnearby Templar church. Like all Templar churches it\nhas a circular nave. Damaged in the war it now has\na wooden roof.\nAfter a short pub stop, we visited the church of St\nClement Danes, where the bells play 'Oranges and\nLemons', before crossing the road to the Royal Courts\nof Justice. This is a huge building, built like a cathedral.

    "content": "found that heavier drinkers had twice the mortality\nrate after ten years than light drinkers.\nWork currently being carried out at St Mary's Hospital suggests that alcoholism may be hereditary.\nIt could be linked to a gene, which, if activated, causes\nalcohol to be converted into a strongly addictive\nsubstance. The biochemical basis for alcoholism is\nthus being uncovered and lends weight to the theory\nthat it is a 'real' illness, not a moral problem.\nOnce someone has become a 'problem drinker', it\nis extremely unlikely that they will ever be able to drink\n'normally' or socially again. Organisations exist to help\nheavy drinkers cut down, but for those who cannot\ncontrol their drinking, usually the only answer is to cut\nout alcohol altogether, with the help of organisations\nlike Alcoholics Anonymous.\nHow widespread is alcoholism?\nThe figures quoted at the beginning of this article are\nonly a rough estimate. It is nearly impossible to\naccurately gauge how many alcoholics there are since\nso many remain untreated or unrecognised. Surveys\nquoted by the National Association of Health\nAuthorities suggest that 6% of the men and 1% of\nwomen nationally are drinking at dangerous levels\nImore than 50 and 35 units of alcohol per week\nrespectively).\nThey also cite mortality rates due to alcohol as being\nbetween 8,000 and 40,000 per year. The uncertainty\narises because although alcohol is associated with\nmany types of physical ill health, only about 3,000\ndeath certificates per year mention alcohol as a primary cause of death. These figures mean that\nalcohol misuse is one of the major causes of\npremature death.\nSeveral researchers have carried out work into\npatterns of drinking amongst students. A survey\ncarried out at Nottingham University into student\ndrinking patterns asked students whether they ever\nfelt they were unable to control their drinking. 7% said\nthey felt the could not control their drinking and a frightening 20% said they had suffered blackouts or\nshaking hands, both strong indicators of alcoholic\nbehaviour. Interestingly in this study the proportions\nfor men and women who felt their drinking was out\nof control were almost identical, although the number\nof self confessed heavy drinkers was much higher\namongst men than women, in line with the national\nfigures.\nA survey amongst students at a London medical\nschool suggested that although drinking amongst\nmale students matched that for the general\npopulation, female students drank much more heavily.\nAgain nearly 20% of the students felt that they might\nhave a drinking problem and had appeared to do so\nfrom their responses to a section in the survey\ndesigned to test for alcohol abuse. Over half felt their\ndrinking had affected their academic performance at\nsome time.\nAll these results suggest that alcohol has a particularly devastating effect on students, most likely\nbecause of the nature of student social life. Reasons\nfor drinking almost always seem to centre around peer\npressure and the prominence of drinking at social\nevents, something Imperial College is no stranger to.\nThe welfare survey carried out at IC last year bears\nout these results although it was not directly\nconcerned with alcoholism. The number of heavy\ndrinkers was roughly 25% of men and 15% of\nwomen. About 15% of the drinkers said they drank\nevery night while over a quarter drank more than five\ntimes a week.\nThere is every reason to suppose that students at\nIC are as at risk as students elsewhere.\nThe social costs of alcoholism.\nAlcoholism affects not only the individual concerned\nbut the society in which they live. The economic costs\nPage 32\nof alcohol abuse in society amount to \u00a31.9 billion\n(1986).\nThe social cost to industry, in terms of time lost\nthrough illness, unemployment and premature death,\nis the bulk of this total, \u00a31.6 billion. The burden on\nthe National Health service is estimated at about \u00a3115\nmillion.\nThe cost of alcohol related road accidents is over\n\u00a3100 million, whilst criminal activities, including both\ntraffic offences and drink related court cases, costs\nthe country about \u00a340 million. Not all these costs can\nbe attributed to alcoholics, but they do give evidence\nof the scale of the problem.\nThe most disturbing cost is the expenditure in\nresponse to alcohol related problems by national\nbodies and in research. This is less than \u00a31 million,\nor 0.05% of the cost to the country. Given the\nsuccess of groups such as Alcoholics Anonymous in\ncuring alcoholism, a little more expenditure in this area\nmight reduce the cost to industry in particular.\nThe effect of alcoholism on the workplace mainly\nmanifests itself in declining standards of work, lower\noutput, excessive absenteeism, higher levels of sick\nleave, an increased number of accidents and strained\nrelationships with fellow workers. Employers face the\nproblem of both recognising alcoholics and dealing\nwith them. Problems can be exacerbated because\nmanagement, union officials and fellow workers often\nbelieve that a person's health problem is a private\nmatter.\nUnion Officials and fellow workers can often believe\nthat they are acting with the best of intentions by\ncovering up cases of problem drinking for members\nand fellow employees. Management also ignore\nbreaches of discipline until they have allowed the\nsituation to deteriorate to such a degree that severe\ndisciplinary action becomes inevitable, frequently\nresulting in dismissal. This is destructive for both the\nemployee and the employer. However, there are\nfeelings that more companies are beginning to take\nan enlightened attitude and deal with alcoholic\nemployees more responsibly.\nYou may think that this article doesn't apply to you.\nIt may do. Try the questionnaire. The results may\nshock you. Alcoholism is more widespread than most\npeople think. But alcoholism is only a disease, which\ncan be arrested. With help, it need n't be a problem.\nAnd the answers\nAccording to Alcoholics Anonymous: if you answered yes to one of the questions, there is a definite warning that you may be an alcoholic. If you answered yes to two questions, the\nchances are that you are an alcoholic, if you answered yes to three or more you are definitely an\nalcoholic.\nThis may seem very extreme, but AA claim that their experience of dealing with recovering\nalcoholics has shown them that this is all it takes.\nNo-one else can convince someone that they are an alcoholic if they don't want to accept it.\nEqually, it may be difficult for the families and friends of alcoholics to accept that someone they\nknow is more than a 'heavy drinker'.\nIf you are worried by the amount you drink and the answers you've given to these questions\nyou can get help from: Alcoholics Anonymous. The aim of all A A groups is to give up alcohol\nentirely and develop an alcohol-free life. Tel. 071 352 3001 Drinkwatchers. Drinkwatchers help\nheavy drinkers reduce their consumption to sensible levels. It is not intended for those who are\ndependent upon alcohol and wish to abstain totally. Tel. 071 381 3155 The College Health\nCentre is available on internal 3099.\nIf you are concerned for someone else, you can get help from: Al-Anon Family Groups. These\nself help groups are for the families and close associates of problem drinkers. The aim is to\nrelieve the pressure of living with the drinker by sharing experiences and giving support. You can\njoin whether or not the problem drinker is attending an AA group or receiving other help. Tel. 071\n403 0888 Alateen. This group is similar to Al-Anon, but it is for the teenaged children of\nproblem drinkers, who often feel happier with the support of people their own age, and do not\nalways want to share their experiences with parents or other adults.\nCase study\u2014an IC graduate\nMy name's Susan, I'm an Imperial College graduate\nand I'm an alcoholic.\nI left Imperial College some time ago with a degree,\nplenty of good memories, a lot of friends...and a drink\nproblem. When I arrived at IC, I didn't have a problem.\nMy parents had encouraged me to drink in moderation\nfrom about the age of fourteen, so I was fairly aware\nof my limits and how to drink sensibly and sociably.\nThis didn't change for two years as I only drank a little\noccasionally. Then I became successively involved\nwith two socially active groups who did drink a lot.\nMy drinking patterns altered radically. I acquired a taste for real ale and, in an effort to prove I was equal\nto my male friends I acquired an ability to drink pints\nthat seems ludicrous looking back. Here is evidence\nof the particular pressures which I think IC can exert\nto encourage students into alcoholism: so much of the\nculture seems to be underlined by a competitiveness\nwhich at its most extreme manifests itself in drinking\ncompetitions and downing yards of ale. A great deal\nof social life seemed to revolve around pubs and bars.\nAgain I was under the impression I could handle my\ndrinking. This was despite the fact that I was having\nblackouts with increasing regularity and that after a while I was getting into financial difficulties. I also\nbegan to spend more time drinking because I wanted\nto escape from my problems. Even after a Christmas\nI prefer to forget, when I drank nearly two bottles of\nspirits in a week because I was depressed, I still\nbelieved I could control my drinking, merely promising\nto myself that I wouldn't ever drink alone. This only\nresulted in me finding lots of excuses to spend time\ndrinking with other people. At one point I was drinking\nheavily almost every night. When I realised this it\nshocked me enough to cut down a little. But worse\nwas to come. I was unusually fortunate for a long time\nin that I rarely got hangovers, but I began to get them\nmore often. Then I began to get 'reverse hangovers':\nI would wake up feeling fine and then start to feel\nworse and worse during the day, including shaking\nand feeling sick. It was the point at which I realised\nthat these were actually alcohol withdrawal\nsymptoms, that I finally acknowledged I was an\nalcoholic. Other things began to fall into place. I realised that once I had had one drink, I was incapable\nof stopping unless there was some external control,\nsuch as being with someone who was only having a couple of drinks because they were driving. When I stopped, the pace of my illness began to accelerate\nrapidly: I was starting to have cravings at definite\ntimes of the day and I was finding it hard to work\nbecause I was either hung over or in need of a drink.\nI acknowledged and faced up to my alcoholism when\nI went home to my parents at Easter. On my last night\nat home we had gone to the pub. I drank a great deal\ntoo much, partly because I was depressed. The next\nday I began to feel ill. On the train back to London I started shaking and feeling freezing even though the\ncarriage was warm. That was the point I knew I was\nnever going to pass my finals if I didn't stop drinking\nthere and then. I haven't had a drink since. That was\ntwo months ago. Since then I feel in control of my life\nfor the first time in years, I'm much more emotionally\nstable and physically much healthier. I don't know\nwhether I 'll never drink again, but I'm determined to\ngo through each day with the philosophy that I'm not\ngoing to take that first drink. Imperial College didn't make me an alcoholic; that was already in my make-up. But IC certainly propelled me more rapidly into\nalcoholism and made it harder for me to see my\nproblem for longer.\nPage 33\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX reporters and photographers describe their experiences and views of Easter's Poll Tax\n'riots.' Police brutality amidst a public uprising against the Poll Tax\u2014who started it all, anyway?\nTrafalgar square bashing\nOn a glorious, sunny day at the end of March, the Anti\nPoll Tax rally marched from Kennington Park to\nTrafalgar Square.\nA good natured diverse, collection of families and\nindividuals made up the countless numbers of\ndemonstrators, in high spirits walking to protest about\nthe crippling tax. The square filled near to capacity\nas the masses continued to flood in at 4 o 'clock.\nTwenty minutes later, a sit down protest outside the\nsecurity gates of No. 10 prompted the end of peace\nand tranquility in inner London.\nThe police vainly attempted to remove the sitters.\nDisturbance was inevitable, and adding to the distress\nof the demonstration, the Riot and Mounted Police\nentered into the fray. The black- flag-carrying\nAnarchists and the Anarcho Punks were sparked into\nviolent reaction.\nA scaffold clad building near the South African\nembassy was taken and used as an offensive\nplatform. Scaffold joints and poles were removed and\nhurled as spears and missiles. Cement and stone was\ndislodged and the site office Portakabin 'torched'.\nNext door the embassy kindled into flame soon after.\nFire Engines and Brigade men were inexcusably\nattacked, although Ambulance workers throughout\nthe day were left alone.\nMany of the marchers had obviously been spoiling\nfor an excuse to lash out at the police, not just the\nPoll Tax. It was, however, the police who\ninstrumented the start of the trouble. Without the\nheavy handed, and surely misguided, attitude of those\nin control, the trouble would not have flared and\nspread as it did. The officers were ill-informed,\nconfused and scared. Many of them had been dragged\nin from football grounds and the like as the emergency\ngrew.\nThe Riot and Mounted Police charged\nindiscriminately at the crowds to disperse the\nmultitudes. Snatch squads raided the front lines of the\nprotestors, to root out troublemakers; a hopeless task,\nwith a later stated number of three to three and a half\nthousand rioters out of the huge number of innocents.\nThe Police attempted to restrict entry to the Square\nand further progress up Whitehall, pushing protesters\non this side to the Embankment. Many\ncircumnavigated the blockage to gain entry to\nTrafalgar Square, where violence flared in retaliation\nfor the action against the peaceful protest outside\nNo.10.\nBy 5 o 'clock, the area north and south of the square\nrang out with chants of \"Stazi\" and \"Maggie\nThatcher's boot boys\". Shattering glass concentrated\nthe voices and exclamations of the crowds. As police\nmoved in on small groups they were rushed by\nsurrounding crowds.\nIn a move to disperse the demonstrators from\nTrafalgar Square, the police pushed them up Charing\nCross Road. Harassed marchers spread to the\nadjacent streets, including St Martins Lane, where\nthey trashed and looted on there way.\nWest End tube stations were closed adding to the\ndifficulties of those who just wanted to get out!\nPage 36\nOxford Street was next in the firing line as three to\nfour thousand people rampaged its length. People\nspread to the neighboring roads to the south, taking\nthe back roads into the heart of the West End which\nwas ritually smashed. Shopkeepers in Regent Street\nclaimed two thousand people had run its course. They\nwere then turned by the police and pushed back to\nwhere they had been pushed from. These were the\n'tactics' that not surprisingly failed to clear the streets.\nA call for an assault on the Chinese Embassy was\naverted by a lightning response from the police\nradioing ahead. A fire engine had been on standby,\njust in case.\nRound in circles the protesters were forced,\nnavigated by the short sighted will of the police, nearly\nevery side road was entered and affected. The crowds\nwere pushed again down Oxford Street, heading east\nto Tottenham Court Road where tourist coaches\npassed by, their passengers' faces pressed hard\nagainst the windows to attain a clear view.\nEventually, the marchers who remained were\nbrought back to Trafalgar, the place that they had\ndesperately been trying to clear. Riot police charged\nsilent protestors on the steps of St Martins in the\nFields. More considerately, Uniform officers cleared\nthe steps of the National Gallery.\nBleeding out of the square, people moved again on\nWhitehall and No.10, this time attended by thirty\npolice vans and coaches. Nothing happened!\nRioting continued late in to the evening throughout\nthe West End. Theatres, cinemas, and restaurants\nwere barricaded, hoarding their customers\nprotectively.\nMany people had talked of a revolution but nobody\nhad expected the Battle of Trafalgar in the centre of\nour Capital. Shocked and bemused, people wandered\nthe streets not knowing how it all happened. The\npolice still have many lessons to learn in their pursuit\nof civil order. It can only be hoped that the next time\nthis kind of event occurs, they do not attempt the\nshort sharp shock approach, which is more likely to\nkill than cure.\n\n"

    "content": "\u2022 If they decide that it is 'unreasonable' for them to\ngive you the information.\nThe data holder can charge you for the service.\nAlthough local authorities tend not to charge, many\nprivate companies will bill you for the maximum \u00a310\nfee. In some cases, when the information is held on\na number of separate systems, the bill can be as high\nas \u00a360. A charge can be levied on each request with\nno guarantee that they hold information about you.\nIf you are refused information you are not told why,\nthey may not even have any information at all. The\nfee that you have paid may not be returned, making\nsearching for the information that you require a costly\nand frustrating business.\nOther Freedom of Information Legislation.\nIn recent years there have been a number of small\nadvances towards total freedom of information.\nThe Local Government (Access to Information) Act\n1985 was introduced as a private member's bill by\nRobin Squire. It increases the public's rights of access\nto council meetings and any associated documents.\nThe agenda for any meeting of the council or any of\nits sub-committees must be available for three clear\ndays before. Documents that will be discussed at the\nmeeting and any background information must also\nbe available. Copies must also be obtainable for a small fee.\nBefore the act was introduced it was possible for\ncouncils to withhold information without consulting\nthe public.\nAccess to Personal Files Act 1987.\nThis act allows people access to personal files, such\nas social security and housing records, held by local\nauthorities. It also allows parents access to their\nchildren's school records and students in further\neducation can also see their files.\nAccess to Medical Reports Act 1988.\nArchie Kirkwood MP introduced another private\nmember's bill to allow people access to medical\nreports requested by insurance companies or\nemployers. You have the right to inspect, correct and\neven withhold the report if you wish, although the\ninsurance company or employer may not take kindly\nto this.\nEnvironmental and Safety Information Act 1988.\nWith the increase in environmental matters came an\nexplosion in the amount of information that people\nwanted. Before this bill was introduced it was possible\nto discover how much waste a company was legally\nallowed to discharge but not whether they were\nobeying the limit. Under the new bill, public registers\nof all enforcement notices must be set up and\nmaintained.\nIn addition to this legislation there are plans by the\nEEC to introduce an Environmental freedom of\ninformation act which this government backs. It will\ngo further than our existing laws and should be in\nforce by January 1993.\nConclusions.\nIt is noticeable that the legislation for the freedom of\ninformation was introduced through private members\nbills. There was no government support. Neil Kinnock\nhas given a promise to introduce freedom of\ninformation but there is no concerted campaign by the\nLabour party in the Commons, at present.\nIndividual bills have singled out areas that needed\nimproving. The legislation so far, however, shows a scattered approach towards a workable freedom of\ninformation act.\nThe organisations that are campaigning for the\nfreedom of information have a common goal: a freedom of information act similar to the ones in\nAmerica, Canada and Australia. These acts allow\nnormal everyday people access to all but the most\nsecret information.\nWhat is deemed to be too secret for the public to\nsee? The easiest way around this problem would be\nto have nothing that was too secret, nothing that\nwould damage the country by its disclosure. As the\nmajority of information that would be withheld under\na freedom of information act would be military if you\nremoved the need for military secrets then you could\nhave complete openness.\nHow much will a freedom of information act cost?\nVery little, probably less than it costs for the\ngovernment to withhold the information. In Australia\nand Canada the cost of running a freedom of\ninformation act comes to about \u00a36.6 million, the\nminutest fraction of the money spent on\nadministration and paperwork. Is this too much to pay\nfor the right to seek the truth?\nThe way forward\nOne major step forward would be to increase the\nscope of the Data Protection Act to manual records.\nThis would increase the range and extent of personal\ndata that people can inspect and remove the glaring\nanomaly that exists at present. In a recent survey it\nwas found that nearly 50% of people intended to use\nthe data protection act and about 80 to 90% of people\nwanted greater access to information held about\nthem.\nThe final goal must be a full freedom of information\nact. On its own this will not remove the fact that we\nlive in a society in which secrecy is inbred. Once this\nbarrier has been removed and the insanity that results\nin reports on cycling proficiency being stamped\n'confidential' corrected, then perhaps we will be able\nto live in a more open and truthful society.\nIf you are interested in pushing for freedom of\ninformation then the following organisations will be\nthe best way to help.\nThe Campaign for Freedom of Information.\n3 Endsleigh Street, London, WC1H ODD.\nTel 278-9686.\nNational Council for Civil Liberties.\n21 Tabard Street, London, SE1 4LA.

    "content": "BLESSED UNIONS\nThis is probably the third year in succession that FELIX\nhas run the 'Imperial College Union to merge with St\nMary's Hospital Medical School Student Union' story.\nThis union of Unions has been through more false\nstarts than a Cortina on a damp morning. It now looks\nas if the open hostility between last year's presidents\nhas given way to a good working relationship and, at\nlong last, an agreement. The agreement is that things\nshould stay largely as they are.\nMaybe un ionisation is contagious. St Mary's Union\nthis year played host to the first meeting of the\nNational Association of Medical Students (NAMS).\nNAMS could best be described as conglomeration of\n26 medical school student unions, working together.\nIt is the first time that the medical schools have\nformed such political links.\nFinancially, ICU itself would seem to be doing a passable impression of a black hole. The Union Snack\nBar has made a loss of over \u00a312000 while the Union\nrun bookstore, while no longer making a loss, will not\nbe paying dividends for at least two years.\nDespite this, the Union has managed to produce a surplus equal to a quarter of its \u00a3450,000 grant from\nthe College. The College was so impressed by this that\nit has lowered the grant by \u00a310,000.\nThis surplus is due, at least in part, to Dave\nPeacock, Union Manager for the last three years and\nthe man largely responsible for changing the fortunes\nof the bookshop. His job would come high on\nanyone's list of thankless tasks and, just three weeks\nago, he tendered his resignation.\nIn addition to the grant and the profits from the\nvarious outlets, the Union has assorted other ways\nof pulling in the cash. One such money spinner is the\nCareers Fair. The money raised is distributed by the\nIndustrial Relations Committee which consists of a chairman, the three union office sabbaticals and the\npresidents of the CCUs. Coincidentally, this year, a significant proportion of this money is going on\ncomputer equipment for the union office and the\nCCUs.\nThat part of the Union responsible for raising money\nfor OTHER PEOPLE, Rag have had a typical rag year,\nfollowing their time honoured traditions. The year\nstarted with the traditional tid d ly winking down Oxford\nStreet and the London wide game of monopoly. It\ncontinued with Rag Week and the traditional beer\nfestival and slave auction, finishing traditionally with\nKeele University banning the Rag Mag on the grounds\nthat it was a sexist, racist, able is t and obscene\npublication.\nOn the subject of obscenity in the Union, next\nyear's President will be Paul Shanley. Mr Shanley beat\nthree other candidates by apparently claiming not to\nhave paid his tube fair. He will be joined in the Union\nOffice by Hon. Sec. Murray Williamson and, on his\nsecond attempt, Deputy President Ben Turner.\nMr Turner was originally the only candidate for the\npost, and became the first ever would be sabbatical\nto lose to New Election, splendidly represented in\nFELIX by Jessica Rabbit. He then stood again, this\ntime against two flesh and blood candidates and won.\nDave Smedley's successor as FELIX Editor is Chris\nStapleton. Mr Stapleton had only one opponent,\nConSoc plant Thomas Wyatt, and won by an\noverwhelming margin.\nThe year ended, appropriately, with the Great\nImperial Debate. Speakers from IC past and present,\nincluding Nina Temple of the British Communist Party\nand Trevor Phillips of London weekend Television, met\nto argue over whether or not Imperial College should\nbe razed to the ground. The answer was a definite\nYES.\nPage 15\n\n"

For a really good night out, head for the sleazy slime y squats where the crea tur night creep at dusk and slink away to sleep at dawn.\nLondon clubbing\nKitKat\nThe KitKat is where most beginners go. At such\nplaces the dress code is: the more hair (preferably\ncoloured more unnaturally than a tube of Smarties)\nand the fewer clothes the better, so long as they are\nblack, or lace, or rubber, or sharp and very erotic. Here\nyou will find naked caged dancers, dangling\nprecariously above the dance floor, luring ly pulsating\nto the sounds. Other, more introvert, totally naked\nwomen stalk the dancefloor and clear away the\nglasses.\nThe KitKat's crowd changes every few months with\nthe venue and night, but the regulars are easily\nrecognised by their hairstyles. You can join them, at\na cost, at the upstairs extension centre (hair only) so\nlong as the colour you choose clashes with everyone\nelse. Sadly, most of the stunning ladies are Yugoslavs,\nFrench, German or Italian, and most of the ravishing\nmen are only interested in the Yugoslavs, French,\netc... It's the place to go on a sex-drive.\nThe music? No one cares so long as they look wie rd enough. Even Madonna gets an occasional sing.\nThere's a nice dose of good indie, bad indie, goth punk\nand The Cure. Does Robert Smith have shares in these\nclubs? There he goes up the stairs, or is he the one\nat the bar, on the dancefloor, etc. etc...If you don't like it, there are enough dark alcoves to occupy\nyourself in between.\nOnce accepted here, you are ready to progress to\nthe hard-core clubs. These are mostly sordid, slime y, illegal and the places to be seen at. Due to a high\npolice presence, especially around King's Cross, they\nPage 34\ntend to move frequently, so leaflets and word of\nmouth are the key to cornering one. Once found,\nselect your chosen club by the style of dress, which\nalso implies the style of music. Follow the crowd.\nSlimelight\nUp at Angel in Slimelight fester another breed. The\nonly lighting throbs from glowing hair and poached\nflesh, simmering in the mud or hanging like albino\nkippers in the smoked air. Slimelighters are elitist and\nsnobs. They sit around regally getting stoned and\ntripping and couldn't care less what goes on. The DJ's noticed this long ago, so play some of the worst,\nunidentifiable sounds around. Entry is exorbitant\n(members and guests only); clothes are worn but\npunks are easy prey for amorous designs as there's nothing else to do in that closet all night. Strangers\nare estranged. If you haven't got green or flour e scent hair, forget it. You'll have a miserable time and may\nlose your DM's in the mud.\nWraith\nAt the same time, Wraith offers the ultimate all night\nand the next day travelling commune. As the last Goth\nstronghold, it is run illegally in a warehouse and is\noften 'interrupted' at 1.30am by the King's Cross\npolice, and then ends the night in a jail or a Camberwell flat before migrating to Camden Palace\nwith the dawn. There's none of that indie-crap here.\nResidents either resemble a walking black drapery or\nare barely decent enough for a strip parlour. The\nregulars even appear from Southend and are easily\nidentified as the ones still flinging their arms about to\nthe dodge PA at 7.30am Sunday. Everyone else has\ngone to catch the first tube or has passed out in a pool\nof the sewage and toxic waste that oozes down the\nwalls.\nBadcat\nIf you can't stand the pace of dancing from 11pm Saturday to 2pm Sunday you could always opt for a paisley-clad bop down at Badcat 'til 3.30am. It used\nto be full of the greatest freaks until the indie-bopper s and sc allies took over. It's mainly indie-chart, but most\npeople find something to groove to, if they can cram\nthemselves onto the dancefloor, or bar, or toilet, or\nanywhere. Spats resembles the inside of a mini-metro\nin size, and is a steaming jungle.\n\n"

He landed, apparently on his\nback, on a second floor gallery over 70ft below. There\nwere no suspicious circumstances.\nDespite the efforts of friends and passers-by who\ngave him emergency first-aid, Mr Madhab died in\nWestminster hospital two hours later. He is said to\nhave lost consciousness within seconds of falling.\nOne half of a double door leading on to the gallery\nhad to be broken down to allow the stretcher bearing\nMr Madhab to leave. The security guards on duty\nhad been unable to unlock it although Chief Security\nOfficer Geoff Reeves claims they had a key. The key\nmay have jammed.\nMr Madhab had been among some 20 Tizard Hall\nresidents who had gone out for a meal the previous\nevening after which he and three friends returned to\nhis room to talk. It was then that, despite his friends\nprotests, Mr Madhab started 'window-walking'. He\nhad been out and back in once and was standing on\nthe window ledge when he tried to pull himself up\nby his arms. He is believed to have lost his grip. His\nfriends, one of whom tried to give Mr Madhab mouth-to-mou fh resuscitation, were said to be suffering from\nshock.\nThe coroners inquest into the death began on\nWednesday 13th June and the body was cremated the\nfollowing Friday.

He died in Westminster Hospital never\nhaving regained consciousness.\nShourjo was in Maths. 1; he had just completed\nhis dissertation on 'The Farkas Lemma and Duality'.\nHis supervisor, Dr. 0 . Pretzel, called it highly\noriginal, and Shourjo a first class student.

He\nadded that he was 'much loved and will be much\nmissed.'\nMr Madhab was said to be a brilliant student and\na gifted mathematician. He came from a cultured and\nindispensable people, who made the Hall work. He\nmade things happen. He was gregarious, organised\nand sympathetic; he knew everybody and was close\nto many. Next year he was to be a Tizard Hall re app: he was a natural choice, and he was looking forward\nto it.\nWe all have a great sense of loss - the loss of a friend, a brilliant and incisive mind, a warm and\ncolourful character.

    "content": "FELIX Editor Dave Smedley, exhausted and cynical, gives his view of those wonderful people who've\nput up with him all year.\nThe Staff\nThe staff in the FELIX Office have been fretting for\nweeks, ever since I promised to write an article about\nthem for this issue. They have a totally unreasonable\nmistrust of me. In certain cases, they think I am going\nto poke fun at their excessive hair loss, their rather\nyoung age and their eating habits. As any regular\nreader of FELIX this year will know, I am totally\ntrustworthy and would never stoop to the depths of\nknocking my fellow workers. Or would I? One of the biggest stars of this year has to be Adam\nHarrington. As news editor, he has not only been short\nof a news team, he has often been short of news as\nwell. Adam has attempted to force Kulture down the\nthroats of the ignorant masses in the FELIX office by\nplaying classical music at every opportunity. This has\nbeen much to the distress of the music editor, who\nprefers Carter the Unstoppable Sex Machine to\nBeethoven. Although I have almost tripped over him\non occasions 'The Weasel,' as our diminutive news\neditor has become known, has been irreplaceable and\nI owe him more thanks than I am capable of giving\nin these few words.\nIf you look at the photograph on this page, you will\nnotice one spaced-out individual who does not appear\nto be on the same planet as everybody else. Staring\ninto the distance is one thing Adam Tinworth has been\nforced to practice on many occasions this year. As\ntheatre reviews editor he has seen some appalling\nplays as well some good ones, and has now gained\nthe ability to switch on that glazed look at a moment's notice. Adam has pasted a vast amount of this issue\nand has written a sizeable chunk as well. Although\nhe is the youngest of the staff, he doesn't act it.\nJeremy Burnell acts this part out perfectly. He has\nprovided the FELIX Office with a jovial atmosphere,\nalthough his humour does tend to verge on the sick\nside. In his attempts to emulate an RCS hack, Jeremy,\nor 'Soft-Scoop' as he is usually known, has become\na scavenger of late. He frequently roots around\ntelephone boxes late at night in the hope that some\ndistributor will have left a pile of vouchers for some\nuseful food products. Soft-scoop's latest acquisitions\ninclude a wad of 'buy one get one free' vouchers for\nthe local Burger King. Jeremy is now the only person\nI know capable of eating seven 'Whoppers' in one day.\nApart from stuffing himself silly with fast food,\nJeremy has worked incredibly hard on the money side\nof FELIX. Without him, very few bills would have been\npaid or sent this year and I would probably have had\na nervous breakdown. I am very grateful for all his help\nthis year, even if he has got a silly laugh.\nBook reviews have appeared this year, courtesy of\nIan Hodge, hereafter referred to by his\nnickname/Bodge'. Bodge came to the FELIX office an\ninnocent fresher, pure as the driven snow. Sexual\ninnuendo would pass him by, leaving him standing as\nthe office fell about laughing. Not so now. Bodge now\nhas a more perverse sense of humour than a jester\nin a brothel. I feel FELIX has ruined the touching\nnaivety which Bodge once had, and which I preferred\nto the constant Finbarr Saunders persona that he has\nnow taken on. Despite all this Ian has been a constant\nsource of help on FELIX, and has written and pasted\nup more than I dare imagine. He has my immense\ngratitude for all he has done on FELIX and my\nsympathy for deciding to edit the Union Handbook.\nToby Jones has been this year's cinema reviews\neditor. With his chatty writing style he has added a Page 84\ngreat deal to the reviews pages. His filing system is\nstill a mystery to all but the inner circle of reviewers.\nThe 'system' seems to go something like, 'take one\ndesk drawer and a pile of information and photographs\nand combine with a liberal sprinkling of chaos.' Along\nwith Toby's filing has come his eating. Toby's mind\nis never far away from the subject of food and when\nhe'll be eating it next. If you want to spot him on the\nphotograph, he is the one on the far right, leaning\ndown to grab an illusion ary doughnut on the ground.\nMany thanks for your help Tobes, you've been a laugh\nand fun to be around.\nBeards are an accessory which featured heavily in\nthe FELIX Office at the beginning of the year. Then\nbearded science Editor, Jason Lander, was later\nreplaced by a similarly bearded Simon Haslam, who\nhas often rushed in on a Thursday with a science\narticle, exclaiming 'I 'll paste it up this afternoon.'\nJason's beard has since left his chin, along with an\ninch wide strip of hair from his head. The top of his\nhead now resembles a miniature wooded golfing\nfairway, which probably explains why I have often felt\nlike clubbing him. Jason and Simon have provided\nsome good science coverage and a massive thanks\nis again due to both of them. I should mention at this\npoint that Jason, with the aid of enough coffee to\nkeep an elephant high for a week, has stayed up for\na large part of the round the clock production of this\nissue; he's a hero, albeit a cynical one.\nOne of the hacks from last year, Liz Warren, has\nproven to be another mainstay of this year. Almost\nas addicted to caffeine as the aforementioned 'Space'\nLander, Liz has made more cups of coffee and written\nmore 'instant' features than anyone else in the office.\nBest known for her mammoth features, specifically\nthe pornography one, Liz has the ability to write a minimum of 1000 words on any topic of conversation\nimaginable. She is the kind of person who, when filling\nout a form, always has to use the separate sheet of\npaper provided. Many thanks are due to her for\nsteadfast late night pasting and subbing on this issue\nespecially.\nThe photographic section of FELIX has expanded\nmassively this year. With every photographer aspiring\nto a job on 'Playboy,' the darkroom has been\ncontinually drained of materials. My theory is that they\nare producing dirty pictures in there. Photographers\nthis year have included Richard Eyers, who has\nworked immensely hard on this issue, and Roland\nFlowerdew, who produced most of the photographs\nfor this issue's 'Just 7.'\nThe subject of Just 7 raises the question of what\ndrove Music fiend, Sarah, to volunteer. As the office\ngoth, Sarah has always been the person who made\nsure the music pages appeared. Under the manic rule\nof 'Dingly' Del, she often saved the day with a quick\npaste up. I am very thankful to her and DEL for the\nmusic pages this year, even if DEL has driven me\nround the twist on more than one occasion. DEL I hate\nyou, but thanks.\nDarlings! The biggest n utter in the FELIX Office this\nyear has had to be Adrian Pagan, alias Edna, alias\nFruity, alias 'Darlings.' With his pretentious reviews\nhe has added that daring dash of suave sophistication\nthat the FELIX Office has always lacked but never\nwanted. Fruit, you've been fun to work with, many\nthanks for fashion especially.\nAnd so to the permanent staff. Our printer, Andy\nThompson, has been the hardest working printer I have known. Working late hours on Thursdays and\novernight during the sabbatical elections, Andy has\nnever failed to amaze me. I admire him both as 'boss'\nand fellow worker, and I hope he succeeds in his\nintended career as a musician. (I can't be rotten, he\nhas to print this.)\nBoth Andy and Rose Atkins have been more like\nfriends than staff this year. As typesetter operator,\nRose has worked incredibly hard and has still been\nable to laugh along with all of us. Her drinking tales\nand Spanish holiday recollections have kept us\namused and amazed at the levels of alcohol the human\nbody can take. I wish her the best of luck in all she\ndoes in the future and just hope that I will remain in\ncontact with her and Andy after this year.\nFinally, Chris Stapleton. A great support and a good\nfriend, Chris has escaped the net of this article. His\ndemise, after all, is the prerogative of next year's staff.\n\n"

    "content": "Graphology is the interpretation of handwriting. It is the understanding of the psychology that\nway we consciously and subconsciously express ourselves to others with pen on paper. As w psychological science, graphology is treated with scepticism by those who know of it at only a However, graphology is being used increasingly in business for personnel selection and eva lua as in other areas such as vocational guidance, marriage compatibility and criminology. Ben T Handwritten CV, please\nIn 120AD, the Roman historian Suetonius 1 ran quill us said of Emperor Augustus, 'He does not separate his\nwords-l do not trust him.' A link between\nhandwriting and personality had been established, but\nit was not until the early nineteenth century that\nserious research on the subject began. This was\nundertaken by a group of French churchmen who\nattempted to examine the link between personality\nand the form of letters. The result was simply a catalogue of signs and rules, with no attempt to\nintroduce psychological analysis. Their student, Jean\nMichon, and his pupil, Jules Jamin, were both branded\n'just interpreters of signs'. The art did not develop into\na science until Jamin requested Alfred Binet, the\nFrench physician and psychologist who founded the\nmodern intelligence test (IQ test), to examine the\nreliability of graphology related to psychological\nmethods of testing character.\nGerman influences entered the field in the late\nnineteenth century, with more detailed analysis of the\nform of writing than in the symbolism of individual\nletters. In 1904, Dr Ludwig Klages determined the\nbasis of graphology as the study of the speed, spacing\nand pressure of the writing, and the intensity and\nvariation of these facets within a manuscript.\nGraphology became a focus of scientific input.\nNeurologists studied the physical factors of the act\nof writing relating personality types to the interplay\nbetween nerves and muscles. Psychiatrists analysed\nthe psycho motor function-how writing movements\nare affected by emotions. Philosophers linked the\ninhibiting force of the Mind and the creative liberal ising elements of the Soul through their projection into the\nexpressive rhythm and motion of handwriting.\nIn recent decades, much investigation of the subject\nhas been undertaken. With the formation of Societies\nfor Handwriting Psychology, the art has developed\ninto a scientific forum, with much evidence to support\nthe validity of grapho logical analysis.\nHow does graphology work?\nAs with most social sciences, there is an accepted\nstandard. It is clear that, through the complexities of\nhuman nature and a person's adaptation to\nsurrounding influences, the standard does not actually\nexist.\nThe British 'copy book' standard is that developed\nduring the 1910's by Marion Richardson, which is\ntaught in British schools to this day. The copy book standard of handwriting varies vastly between\ncountries according to national characteristics and\ninfluences. It also varies within each country at\ndifferent times as a result of the differing spirit of the\ntimes. Thus the cursive copy book style of Richardson\nis giving way to a modern approach to writing based\non block printing, exemplified by typed text.\nWhat can graphology do? The experienced\ngraphologist will be able to determine many facets of\npersonality. These are based under the main headings:\nBasic personality eg tendency towards aggression,\nsensitivity, self-confidence\nTemperament eg emotional control, compulsiveness\nPage 38\nFIG. 1\nFIG. 2\n\n"

They are easy\nto identify by their lack of height and lack of clothes.\nTheir heritage seems to deem a skirt unnecessary and\nthey have an overwhelming urge to cover their bodies\nin fishnet, belts, chains, leather, pvc, etc. What do\nthey use the handcuffs for? To go with the thigh-high\nstiletto domination boots, no doubt. They can be seen\ndancing to anything they can pace up and down to,\nhiding beneath their black and red hair extensions.\nGoths\nA real one will never admit to it, so call them what\nyou like-goth, g of f,g off ick, meat head etc. They\nalways wear black and always go where they know\nthey'll be miserable, accumulating glumly in an alcove\nto swap make-up and hair tips. It is often difficult to\ndifferentiate male and fa male, but generally, the males\nare better looking and wear more make-up.

    "content": "NO PLACE LIKE HOME\nThe cost of living in London, always high, continued\nits steady climb towards exorbitant. Students living\nin Halls of Residence and College administered head\ntenancies next year face unexpected rent rises while\nthose living in private accommodation will lose their\nright to housing benefit.\nOne of the main planks of Neil McCluskey's1989 Election Campaign was that, under him, Hall rents\nwould not rise. As election promises go, this one\nshould have been easy to keep. Under an agreement\nreached between the College and Christine Taig, one\nof Neil's predecessors, Hall rents were to stay at their\n89/90 levels over 90/91. This SHOULD have\nhappened whether Neil had been elected or not. The\nemphasis there is on 'should', the College, claiming\nthat they were short of cash, reneged on the\nagreement. Rents will go up by just under 5%, which\nwas slightly above the then rate of inflation.\nA5% rise is nothing when compared with what the\nresidents of Hamlet Gardens head tenancy will be\nfacing. Senior Assistant Finance Officer, Malcolm\nAldridge claimed that rents there would have increase\nby 20% to balance the books. These figures were\ndisputed by Matthew Bridgewater, student manager\nof the tenancy, who argued the true figure was closer\nto 10%.\nEven allowing for Malcolm's arithmetic\nPage 14\ninconsistencies, the books were in sore need of\nbalancing. The Summer Letting Scheme made a huge\nloss and it is rumoured that the Olave house may be\nlumbered on the account, despite claims by the\ncollege that it would be separately financed. The hall,\nwhich was brought by the College at a time when\ninterest rates were low and house prices were rising,\nrapidly became a liability when the 'economic miracle'\nmiraculously disappeared. Undeterred, the College has\nlaunched an appeal fund, part of which will be used\nto build yet another hall.\nWith the halls becoming more and more expensive\nto keep, the College is having to resort to strong-arm\ntactics to force recalcitrant students to pay their bills.\nQuite simply, debtors will not be allowed to continue\ntheir degrees: no cash, no course.\nIt is not just students in College-run accommodation\nwho will have to pay significantly more. This was the\nyear in which rates were abolished and the poll tax\nintroduced. From September, the vast majority of\nstudents will be unable to claim Housing Benefit,\neffectively doubling their rents. Despite this, most\nprivate sector landlords will be charging more next\nyear. It is tempting to say that the students who spent\none night in their own cardboard city on the college\nwalkway were training for next year. In truth, they\nwere raising money for London's genuinely homeless.\nTHE GENTLE ART OF POLITICS\nImperial College Union could be described as having\nall the political conviction of the SDP, but even it had\nto act when the government started to introduce\nStudent Loans. The idea of replacing grants with a system of low interest loans was first mooted by the\nthen Education Secretary Kenneth Baker. Baker gave\nthe task of working out how such a scheme could be\nrun to the chartered accountancy firm, Price\nWaterhouse, and it was their report which was used\nas the basis for the Student Loans Bill.\nThis year's ICU anti-loans campaign started early\nin the October. The Union, while keeping its usual\ndisdainful distance from the National Union of\nStudents, became involved in a number of NUS\nmarches and the lobbying of MPs. Price Waterhouse,\nfor their sins, were banned from the College Careers\nFair. The effect of this was somewhat diminished\nwhen Imperial College nothing-to- do-with-the-Union-thank-you Conservative Society took it upon\nthemselves to override the Union and invite the firm\nto give a presentation anyway.\nThe loans scheme was officially announced in the\nQueen's Speech in November, and the announcement\nwas followed by a series of NUS marches. These, ICU\nrefused to officially support, a decision Union\nPresident, Neil McCluskey, clearly felt had been\nvindicated when the first ended in violence and\nfourteen arrests. The second march, the following\nweek was more successful with an estimated twenty\nthousand students attending a rally in Glasgow.\nThe anti-loans lobby returned from their Christmas\nholidays to what they thought was good news. The\nmajor high street banks, which were to be heavily\ninvolved in the scheme, had given in to student\npressure and pulled out. But the celebrations were\nshort lived. The government immediately announced\nits intention to continue with its plans and to set up\ntheir own 'Student Loans Company'.\nThe Student Loans Bill became law in April and the\nscheme will be phased in from September.\nPossibly emboldened by this flirtation with proper\npolitics, ICU threw its weight behind a plan to put up\nPro College candidates in May's local elections. 35%\nof the electorate in the Knightsbridge ward of the\nborough of Westminster are students and, the\norganisers of the scheme felt that if they could\nmotivate them enough to vote, then the college could\ngain useful influence with the council. They couldn't, they didn't and the candidates lost.\nIn fact, IC did have some influence with\nneighbouring Kensington and Chelsea council. Bryan\nLevitt, a local councillor and IC's director of\nUndergraduate studies, made history when he\norganised the councils plan to be the first in the\ncountry to use the so-called 'queer bash ers charter',\nthe famous clause 28.\nIC's own home grown right wingers, ConSoc,\nlanded themselves in trouble during the long running\nambulance dispute. They were behind a plan to put\nup posters reading 'Support the Ambulancemen, Let\nthe patients die.' Apparently, they thought this was\nfunny. In just one day, ICU received no less than four\nseparate complaints and the posters were torn down.\nOverleaf left: Triumph Herald damaged in storm\nOverleaf right: Princess Anne visits College\nLeft: The Poll Tax demonstration\nAbove right: Paul Shanley, next year's ICU Pre\nBottom left: Deputy President candidate in ICU\n\n"

    "content": "Stanley and Iris\nFilm\nStarring Robert de Niro and Jane Fonda as the title\ncharacters, Stanley and Iris is basically a good old\nfashioned love story-but don't let that put you off.\nIt is a mature story of two people trying to rebuild their\nlives after a series of misfortunes and how they learn\nto help each other.\nStanley is one of the twenty per cent of Americans\nwho are illiterate. He is ashamed of this and pretends\nthat he can re a a and write just like anybody else. Until\none day he is found out...\nIris lost her beloved husband eight months ago. He\nhad been ill for a long time, so his death was hardly\na surprise but she still grieves for him and finds it hard\nto let go.\nIris is the one who realises that Stanley is\nii literate \u2014suddenly all his little peculiarities, like\nrefusing to sign for his shoes that had been reso led or not wanting to read a fortune cookie, make sense.\nAshamed at having been found out and angry\nbecause his boss fired him when he realised the\nimplications-a cook unable to read could pick up the\nwrong tin: roach powder instead of seasoning salt-Stanley avoids Iris for a while until a run of bad luck\nculminating in the death of his father leads him to try\nto learn to read.\nThe film is very sympathetic-the appeal is in the\nsimplicity and honesty both of the script and the\nfilming. The audience is given an insight into what it\nfeels like to be illiterate-all the things you cannot do\nthat most people take for granted: you can't sign your\nname for a cheque - 'it makes you wonder if you have\na name if you can't write it'; you can't read signposts\nto find your way, or read where a bus is going.\nThe film explores the issue of illiteracy with\ncommendable sensitivity but it is not just made as a comment on society, it is also good entertainment.\nA fine film to watch when you're in the mood for an\nold fashioned romantic movie with an extra twist to\nthe basic plot.\nJ. L. Wright\nTemptation\nTheatre\nIt's hard to believe how the premiere of a fledgling\neastern european democracy, Czechoslovakia, can\nhave written such a zany nightmarish comedy as\nTemptation, now being performed at the Westminster\nTheatre. Vaclav Havel, playwright turned politician,\npresents us with a political allegory paralleling\nclandestine dabbling s in the occult with a belief in\nfreedom of speech and the individual's right to\nchoose. It's hardly surprising then that the play was\nbanned in Havel's native country until Christmas last\nyear.\nDr Henry Forster (Aden Gillet), a promising young\ndoctor at a research institute, is approached by a leprechaun-like devil (Sylvester McCoy) who coaxes\nhim into believing he has enough magical power to\nseduce a young secretary. In fact, he succeeds in\nwooing her, not through magic, but merely by\nspouting forth a proliferation of democratic ideas\ninduced by his discussions with the unnerving ly eccentric 'devil'. But when the director of the institute\ngets wind of Forster's 'plotting', Forster accuses his\nlaid-back girlfriend (Rula Lenska) of shopping him to\nthe authorities, with agonizing consequences. In\nshort, Havel is showing us how easily one can fall prey\nto the 'bureaucratic system,' not just in communist\nCzechoslovakia, but the whole world over.\nWhat makes the production so enjoyable is a combination of stylised movement and visual gags\nthat add an element of dynamic comedy to an\notherwise serious piece of theatre. Full use is made\nof stage smoke, vibrant costumes, an excellent score\nand a cast whose oddball caricatures add grotesque\novertones to the sombre all-dominating bureaucracy.\nStrangely enthralling, but make sure you digest the\nprogramme notes beforehand.\nAdrian Pagan\nTheatre\nGasping\nLike him or hate him, Ben Elton has to be one of the\ncomic phenomena of the late eighties, but sadly his\nbrand of humour is not at all suited to the stage. In\nthis, his first play, Elton focusses his beady eye on\ncorporate lifestyles and ethics, lampooning all the\ngreed and superficiality that big business breeds. As\nusual, his observations are spot on and his ingenious\nuse of metaphors (like 'this machine sucks so much,\nit's like a hyperactive rent boy') are often very funny,\nbut labour ed sexual innuendo and joke overkill make\none think that Elton's message would have exerted\nfar more clout if the subject matter were delivered by\nthe man himself in a fifteen minute cabaret slot.\nHugh Laurie plays the crawling upwardly mobile\nPhilip who hatches a plan to privat is e oxygen, much\non the same lines as bottled water, and produces a machine called 'Suck and Blow' (oo - er). Initially this\nis a huge success but when the scheme turns out to\nhave a devastating effect on the environment (very\nnineties) Philip reneges leading to a black, yet\ninn effectual conclusion. The ever popular Hugh Laurie,\ndespite some interesting yoga esque positions, is much\nthe same as seen on TV whilst the rest of the cast\nincluding Bernard Hill (excellent in Boys from the\nBlackstuff) are desperately unimaginative and\nlacklustre, as is the score.\nBut pretentious arty criticism aside, by the sound\nof it most of the audience appreciated the plethora\nof gags and one out of the three friends I went with\nthought the show was 'brilliant'. One warning though,\nif you do go, take a portable fan: the Theatre Royal\nHaymarket is rather hot and stuffy. An uncanny\ncounterpoint to a play about fresh air.\nAdrian Pagan\nFilm\nRevenge\nYou can tell this film was from the same Director as\nTop Gun. He manages to get a totally irrelevant jet\nsequence into the beginning of the film. Unfortunately\nthe jet is just about the only thing about the film that\nmoves fast.\nKevin Costner plays a just retired American fighter\npilot and (surprise, surprise) Vietnam veteran. After\nhis retirement party, he packs his bags and dog and\nsets off to pay a visit to an old friend in Mexico. The\nold friend, Tibbey, turns out to be an old man with a young wife and criminal empire. Pilot falls in love with\nwife. Wife is frustrated, so she copulates with pilot.\nTibbey finds out, brutally beats both. Pilot sets out\nfor revenge. That's it. Somehow the producers\nmanage to string out the flimsy plot of the original\nnovella into 2 hrs. 9 mins of mind numbing boredom.\nThe basic story is too hackneyed and unoriginal to\nsustain much interest and the subsidiary characters,\nwho are largely irrelevant, are never developed enough\nto become interesting. Added to this already dire\nsituation are the problems the good actors have, trying\nto deliver serious lines that provoke astonished\nlaughter from the audience. Totally failing in its\nattempt to produce a modern western, it doesn't really\nfall into any recognisable genre, and will thus fail to\nfind an audience. This is just as well, because it is truly\ndire.\nAdam T. Page 17\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX investigates code making and codebreaking...\nCryptography\n4,000 years ago a master scribe writing near the Nile\nsketched hieroglyphics that told the story of his Lord's life. He used some unusual hieroglyphic symbols,\nintending to impart dignity and authority to his writing.\nThe scribe incorporated one of the essential elements\nof cryptography; it is the oldest text known to include\na substitution.\nAs the Egyptian civilisation continued, the\nsubstitutions grew more complicated and more\ncontrived. In its first 3,000 years, cryptography arose\nindependently in many places and in most of them it\ndied with the civilisation. In some places it survived,\nembedded in literature, to be elaborated still further\nby later civilisations.\nVatsayana's famous textbook of erotic s, the\nKama-Sutra, lists secret writing as the 45th of the\n64 arts, or yogas, that women should know and\npractice.\nThe Spartans established the first system of military\ncryptography in the 5th century BC. Lacedaemonian\ngenerals exchanged messages by winding narrow\nribbons of parchment around cylindrical staffs. The\nsystem was called the sky tale. Messages were\nwritten onto the parchment lengthwise and the ribbon\nunwound, scrambling the letters. The idea was that\ndeciphering the message needed an identical staff.\nThis reordering is known as Transposition\nEncipherment and is one of the two basic principles\nof modern cryptography.\nMany methods were found to relay the message.\nOne of the more bizarre was to tattoo it onto a slave's head; then once the slave's hair had grown back, to\nsend him to the recipient. Crude and slow this may\nsound, but even as late as World War I, it was\ncommon practice to send spies into enemy territory\nwith messages written in invisible ink on their skins.\nMore scientific cryptograms were devised by the\nearly Greeks; one method was to substitute numbers\nfor letters from an alphabet-square. The substitution\nof one letter for another was a favourite device of the\nRomans. This is an example of the second main\nprinciple of modern cryptography, Substitution\nEncipherment. Caesar had a very poor cryptographic\nimagination and used a system of shift substitution\nwhere D represents A, E represents B etc.\nIn the 1790's a simple cipher machine was invented\nby Thomas Jefferson. It was made from a long\ncylinder made from 36 independant narrower\ncylinders, mounted on an axis and with a jumbled\nalphabet inscribed upon each. The message to be sent\nis divided into 36 letter sections and the cylinders\naligned so that the message can be read along a line\nrunning the length of the larger cylinder. The\ncharacters from another, previously specified line can\nthen be sent as the encrypted message. This was a very clever machine in its day, but now with the\nstatistical information available these days, such a code can easily be broken.\nA cipher for secrecy in telegraphy that was used\nin the Boer War carries the name of Lyon Playfair, as\nin the Lyon Playfair Library here at Imperial College.\nThe cipher was actually invented by his friend Charles\nPage 22\nDETAILS OF ENIGMA MECHANISM Rl M NE oo.o \u201e \u201e\n0 0 6 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0\nOOO OO t joO OOO OOO Wheatstone, a man with a remarkably fertile mind.\nWheatstone constructed an electric telegraph,\ninvented the concertina, studied underwater\ntelegraphy and produced some of the first\nstereoscopic drawings. He discussed phonetics and\nhypothetical speaking machines and popularised the\nmethod for measuring electrical resistance accurately,\nnow known as the Wheatstone bridge.\nLyon Playfair, the first Baron Playfair of St Andrews,\nwas deputy Speaker of the House of Commons and,\namong his many achievements, he helped lay the\nfoundations for modern sanitation. Both Playfair and\nWheatstone were short and bespectacled and they\nwere frequently mistaken for one another-once even\nby Lady Wheatstone.\nWheatstone and Playfair amused themselves on\nSundays by solving the en ciphered personal messages\nin the London Times. The correspond ance of an\nOxford student with his young lady in London was\neasily deciphered. The student proposed an\nelopement. Wheatstone inserted an advertisement in\nthe same cipher remonstrating with her. There\nfollowed a frantic, 'Dear Charlie: write no more. Our\ncipher is discovered!' and then silence.\nIn 1854, Playfair demonstrated what he called\n'Wheatstone's newly-discovered symmetrical\ncipher' to Prince Albert and Lord Palmerston. The\nsystem worked by substituting pairs of letters and\ncou id beat the usual deciphering methods which were\nbased upon single letter frequency analysis.\nThe most frequent letters in English are E(12%) and\nT(9%). The most frequent English pairs or dia graphs are TH (3% %) and HE (2'/2 %). There are, of course,\n26 letters in the English alphabet, compared with 676\ndia graphs. The Playfair cipher was regarded as\nunbreakable. It was simple and practical: no tables or\napparatus were required only a keyword, easily\nremembered and easily changed. Its simplicity made\nit ideal as a field cipher.\nAt a dinner with Prince Albert, Playfair suggested\nit be used in the impending Crimean War and Britain's War Office finally adopted it as the British Army's field\nsystem during the Boer War.\nThe vast use of secret communications in the First\nWorld War lead to the British Type X Mklll Cypher\nmachine and its German equivalent and prehaps the\nmost famous of all encryption machines, the Enigma\nMachine.\nBoth these machines were products of by the new\nage of electricity and me chan is ation and both relied\non a single simple device, widely used in\ncryptography: the wired code wheel or rotor.\nEmbedded around the circumference of each face\nof the rotor are 26 evenly spaced electrical contacts.\nEach contact is connected at random by a wire to a contact on the opposite face.\nWith the rotor stationary, say, a letter T can be\nmapped to the letter Q. When the rotor clicks forward\non step, the letter is mapped to an entirely different\nletter.\nA second rotor shifts a step after the first rotor has\ncompleted its revolution. Several other rotors can be\nadded to the machine.\nnonsense\nThe Enigma cipher was invented by Arthur\nScherbius in 1923, but not patented until 1928. It\nused three rotors and 6 separate plug connections,\noffering more than 5.2 x10 encoding positions.\nThe Enigma differed from the original rotor\nconception in two important ways. The last rotor\nreflected incoming electrical signals back through the\nsystem, generating a new letter. If this was fed into\nanother machine with the same combination of rotors,\nthe original letter would be produced. Hence one\nmachine could act as both encoder and decoder.\nAdded security was given by the use of gears to make\nthe rotor progression irregular.\nAs Hitler began rearming Germany, the Wehrmacht\nbegan supplying their expanding forces with the\nEnigma. During World War II the portable glow lamp Enigma, battery powered, served as the top German\nsystem. Signal officers believed it to be secure. The\nonly disadvantage was that it did not print out a message but lit up individual letters. Fast operation\nrequired three men. One to enter a message, another\nto call out the letters as they lit up and a third to write\ndown the resulting code.\nEventually, the allies obtained one of the Enigma\nmachines. Working with what was then the latest\ncomputing equipment at Bletchley, the brilliant\nmathematician Alan Turin and his team broke the\ncode. This breakthrough was one of Churchill's best\nkept secrets.\nBy decoding German signals Hitler's spies\nparachuting into England were detected and captured.\nTheir reports were then falsified as a means of\nconfusing Hitler.\nSince every effort was being made not to alert Hitler\nto the collapse of Enigma, information gathered could\nnot be used overtly. A strange example arose in naval\nwarfare. If the rate of interception of ships increased\nunaccountably fears about Enigma would have been\nraised. In order to overcome this, spotter planes were\nsent to the known positions on ships, 'accidentally'\nfinding them.\nIn the late 1930's the British introduced the Type\nX Mk III Cipher Machine, developed by Air\nCommodore Oswyn Lywood. This used five drums\nrather than Enigma's three and had the advantage of\nprinting the resulting code on paper. The drums were\nrotated by the operator as he typed thus adding the\nextra complexity needed to defeat German attempts\nto crack the cipher.\nEnigma and it's predecessors were essentially\nmechanically based but the advent of small, cheap\nand powerful electronic computers has led to\nsoftware based cryptograms that even the most\ningenious analyst cannot break.\nThe Enigma, possibly the most famous cipher machine in history, on display in the Science Museum\nPaae 23\n\n"

Biology has just started its second such\nrevolution in twenty years. Most people did not even\nknow the first had occurred!\nThe first revolution occurred in the mid-70s when\nwe learnt how to isolate single genes from complex\norganisms such as the human being and grow them\nin pure form-the recombinant DNA revolution. The\nnext revolution will be the result of a proposal that\nwas first put forward by a group of molecular\nbiologists in Europe and the USA, to establish the\nstructure of all genes in the human being; the Human\nGenome Project as it is called. The cost will be huge,\nperhaps three billion dollars, spread over 10 years.\nWhy is this happening, what will it achieve and how\nwill it be achieved?\nThe function of DNA\nGenes are made of DNA, whose elegant and beautiful\ndouble-helical structure has become a totem of the\nnew biology. Genes code for proteins in the same way\nas tape codes sound or video pictures but instead of\nusing electrical storage, it uses a sequence of simple\nchemicals, the bases.\nBases can be A, G,C or T( the full names are\nirrelevant) and DNA stores information in the triplet\ngenetic code. A small region of DNA could have the\nsequence of bases GGATCTTTT, for example. Broken\nup into triplets of bases we have GG A, TCT and TTT.\nThe cell uses this information to put a protein\ntogether.\nProteins are the catalysts of cells. They can\nmanufacture almost all of the complex organic\nmolecules needed to 'make a human'. A protein is\nmade up of a long, specific sequence of amino acids,\n20 of which are used in the body, put together in a unique order. The order determines the biological\nproperties of the protein and it is this information that\nis stored in DNA. So, in our example, GGA codes for\nGlycine, TCT for Serine and TTT for Phenylalanine and\nthe protein will have these amino acids in this order.\nSo far I hope this is simple to understand. The\nproblem is that the^e is a vast amount of DNA in each\nhuman cell, 6x10 bases, and only 5% of this is\n'genes'. The rest is the space between genes. All this\nDNA is called the human genome.\nHow many genes a^ e there a human being?\nProbably between 10 and 10 , all of which are\npresent in every cell of our body. Of course, all genes\ndo not work in al! cells: brain cells are very different\nfrom blood cells which are themselves very different\nfrom sperm cells and these differences are reflected\nin the genes that are expressed in the different cell\ntypes.\nGenetic Diseases\nThat the system works at all is the product of three\nbillion years of evolution, but it is still touch and go.\nOne per cent of all live births in this country will have\na genetic abnormality that will either kill or result in\nrequiring medical support, sometimes for life. It is this\nthat has powered the surge of work on the genetic\nbasis of development. Genes that are responsible for\nlife threatening diseases such as cystic fibrosis\n(carried by 1 in 20 of the white population of the UK)\nsickle cell anemia, phenylketonuria, thal as semi a and\nTay Sachs disease, have all been identified and the\ndefects that cause disease are now becoming\nunderstood. At present, the best we can do is to offer\ndiagnosis of the condition before a baby is born-ante natal diagnosis, followed by therapeutic abortion,\nif this is requested (it is not always). Perhaps later,\nas the normal function of the gene product is\nunderstood, we will be able to offer treatment rather\nthan this unpleasant method of prevention.\nNot all genetic diseases are caused by single gene\ndefects and a complex of genes interacting together,\nperhaps as many as five or six, can lead to, for\nexample, a predisposition to breast cancer or coronary\nheart disease. Unless we have this gigantic picture of\nwhat normal genes look like in humans we cannot\nestablish what the normal pattern of variation is within\nthe genes, to decide which may contribute to the\ndisease. The function and structure of perhaps 5% of\nour genes are partly understood. The rest of the genes\nare a complete mystery, of unknown structure, of\nunknown function and of unknown effect upon\nhumans.\nAfter the sequence, what next?\nWhat happens when we achieve the goal and\nestablish the sequence? The quick answer is that then\nthe work really starts. How do we establish the\nfunction of a gene knowing only the sequence of\namino acids it contains? In principal, the techniques\nof genetic engineering and molecular genetics allow\nthese problems to be answered, but we quickly run\ninto ethical problems. Genetics is carried out by the\nbreeding of animals or plants together to examine the\neffects of a gene on the offspring. The idea of\nbreeding humans is repugnant and ethically\nunacceptable, so how do we get round this problem?\nThe obvious answer is to use another species and\nsince we are ultimately interested in humans, it must\nbe a vertebrate. The common house mouse is the\npreferred animal: rapid to breed, simple to keep and\nwith a huge store of accumulated information about\nits genetics, development and structure. The\nsequence of all mouse genes is included in the Human\nGenome Project. Since mice have the same amount\nof DNA and about the same number of genes as\nhumans, this doubles the size of the project's huge\ntask. The genetics community is studying several\nother species with equal intensity as the human and\nthe mouse, in particular the fruit fly, Drosophila\nmelanogaster; the nematode worm, Caenorhabditis\nelegans, the yeast and the common gut-living bacteria\nE. coli. Fortunately, these organisms have less DNA\nthan us-the fly and the worm 1 0 s bases, yeast\n4x107 and E. coli 4x106. Sequencing DNA\nHow will the project be done? Technically, we can\nsequence about 600 bases of DNA in one go and the\nnormal way to sequence DNA is to break a small, say\n5000 base, gene randomly into 600 base fragments.\nEach of these fragments is then sequenced, choosing\nfragments at random. Computers are used to identify\nsequences which overlap or are the same, and it is\na relatively simple operation to align lots of sequences\nof 600 bases to give one re pre se native sequence of\nthe whole 5000 bases. It does mean many regions get\nsequenced several times-on average 4-5 and this\nmay seem a labour intensive method as a consequence. It is not, because the process of DNA\nsequencing is automata ble, but the process of\nidentifying specific 600 base fragments to allow the\n\\playing its part in. 25 YEARS AGO\nscience\n5000 bases to be sequenced by about 9 unique 600\nbase pieces, is not and is hugely labour intensive.\nCan we do the whole of human DNA like this? The\ncomputational problems alone would be tough, since\n3x109 bases would require 5 million 600 base\nfragments, all sequenced 4-5 times. This is difficult\nbut what makes it impossible is that some pieces of\nhuman DNA are found at more than one location in\nthis chain-they are repeated. One class of this\nrepeated DNA is about 350 bases long and present\n750,000 times. The computer, comparing 600 base\nsequences would have no way of knowing which of\nthe repeats matched which and would get into a terrible mess.\nSome technical help is needed\nThe way round this is to break the DNA into smaller\npieces. First let us look at chromosomes: there are 46\nof these in humans, so we can analyse just one at a time. This is technically possible. The average\nchromosome is about 3x108 which is a reasonable\nfigure but still too large to sequence directly. So the\nnext step is to make a 'map' of particular sorts of\nsequences along a chromosome, since this map lets\nus break the DNA into smaller regions. We can then\nconstruct sets of fragments of DNA each being about\n40,000 bases long and partially overlapping to cover\nthe whole region. We can now sequence these\n40,000 base fragments by computerised analysis and\nsince we know the precise relationship of 40,000\nadjacent fragments, we never need worry about the\nwhole of the human DNA, just the fragments either\nside. This is technically tough, but again possible and\nis the work that my lab is most involved in. We know\nwhich fragments contain genes that we are already\ninterested in, so we can overcome the problem that\n95% of DNA is not gene and to start with just the bits\nwe know are interesting. Later we can do the rest and\nfind totally new genes. That will be the real\nexcitement!\nThe future?\nWe will need large computers and robots, to make\nsequences and handle DNA, and very careful work in\nour laboratories. The scale of the project will require\ninternational coordination, probably under the Human\nGenome Organisation (HUGO), a group of some 300\nleading figures in human genetics, myself included.\nThe future course of the project is gradually becoming\nclear even though, as in any big money project,\npolitics sometimes takes more time than actual work.\nIf you want to see how this work is actually done, why\nnot come and see my research team for yourself?\nThe revolution has started and there was no\nexplosion at the gates. That doesn't mean it is any\nless revolutionary.\nThe determination of DNA sequence. Each\nband on this analysis represents a base.\nThe sequence is read from the bottom\ngoing from band to band increment ally up\nthe track. Each group of 4 represents all 4\nbases G,A,T and C, and there are about\n200 bases on this analysis. Human DNA\nwould require about 10,000,000 similar\npictures for a complete analysis.\n\u2022 Transistors have led to an incredible\ndevelopment in colour television. Developed by\nJapanese scientists, the portable set has a screen\n7)4\" across and weighs 16lbs. Transistors were\nrequired for al! but the high voltage rectifiers and\npicture tube in order to pack the electronics into a10\" cube. Thanks to this, power consumption is kept\ndown to 30 watts, one tenth of that normally needed.\nAnother change is the use of one electron gun rather\nthan three. The single gun presents red, blue and\ngreen colour information sequentially. The set,\ndeveloped by the Yaou Electric Company of\nKanagawa, is to be introduced to Japanese and\nAmerican buyers shortly.\n\u2022 Lifts getting you down? The logistics of lifts;\nwhere they go, the number of stops they make and\nhow many there are have always been within the\ndomain of architects and engineers. But Miss Helen\nParlow, a research assistant at Imperial, has just\ncompleted a study of these factors on traveller's waiting times. Most of the lift companies' work deals\nwith offices, which only require the filling and\nemptying of the building in two half hours per day.\nUniversities and hospitals have different needs, which\nhas prompted interest in the report from the Ministry\nof Health.\n\u2022 'Consort', the University of London's research\nand training reactor has been officially inaugurated\nat Imperial's field station at Silwood Park in Berkshire.\nIt is water cooled and designed to run at 10OkW. This\ncompares to the 10kW reactor originally envisaged.\nWorking closely with Imperial, designers GEC-Simon\nCarves began about five years ago. The total cost is\nestimated to be about \u00a3100,000. It incorporates\nmany research facilities, notably the large 'bare face'\nbetween the inner tube and concrete shielding.\nAccess to the face is possible within 24 hours of a shutdown.\nThree years ago the University of London turned\ndown an offer of a 'Merlin' reactor as a free gift from\nthe AEI Company.\n\u2022 Concord, the supersonic airliner, is to carry a specially designed cosmic ray meter. The monitor,\nstill in the experimental stage, has been developed by\nthe Atomic Energy Authority. It will be capable of\ndetecting all types of rays, including neutrons, present\nat the 12 mile level that Concord will be flying. Green,\namber or red lights show depending on the dosage.\nGreen is safe, amber is a warning light and red is\ndangerous. Action on a red light will be to descend\nto 9 miles where the density of the atmosphere should\nbe enough to absorb any dangerous rays, although\nthis will probably require a return to subsonic speed.\n\u2022 The Mathematical Association has published\nits report on the teaching of mechanics. It is\nintended as a guide for teachers, and insists that\nmechanics should be taught as part of a mathematics\ncourse rather than in science lessons. But it is feared\nthat this approach may lead to too much abstraction\nand kill interest in the subject. Problems in the physical\nworld cannot be ignored by students' learning\nmethods in so-called 'applied mathematics' they say.\nThe report deals with teaching to pre-university level.\nPage 79\n\n"

    "content": "Ken Weale retired as Union Senior Teasurer in September. Colin Palmer investigates the man\nbehind the job, which he took on 43 years ago...\nProfile \u2014 Ken Issue 87 of FELIX dated 10th February 1956 contains\na profile of Kenneth Edward Weale. Thirty four years\non, Ken is active at Imperial even though he officially\nretired last year.\nKen spent his undergraduate days at Aberyswyth\nwhere he obtained a first in Chemistry, and, after a brief excursion into industry, came to I.C. as a research student in 1946. Ex-ICU President Alan\n'Kitch' Kitchener wrote that Ken's cunning and\nmethodical brain caused Ken to plan his research\nprogramme with great care. He spent just over two\nyears doing experimental work, then he performed\nsuperfluous confirmatory experimental work until the\nsummer, so that he could combine writing his thesis\nwith spending every day at Lord's or Harlington.\nKen was one of the few members of staff who took\nan active interest in Union affairs. In 1956 he became\nthe Hon. Treasurer of I.C. Union, a post he was to hold\nfor thirty four years. Ken was also President of the\nCricket Club and a Vice President of the Rugby club.\n'Students will be relieved to hear that the Treasurer\nis very thrifty:- even Mrs. Robinson (Jen Hardy\nSmith's predecessor) claims that it took her five years\nto cadge a sherry from him' wrote Kitch.\nIn his student days Ken gained a purple in both\nboxing and rug ger. He went with IC Rugger Club to\nDelft, some of whose students believed him to be the\nhero of the famous old English rug ger song Round and\nround went the bl\u2014y great wheel.\nPerhaps Ken has achieved most notoriety in his\nactivities as a cricketer, in which capacity he modestly\nstyled himself 'The Great Doctor'. He batted with a rare and graceful artistry; his most impressive stroke,\nwhich he frequently brought into play, was a firm\nforward push wide of mid-on, which sends the ball\nover the slips' heads for two.\nIn 1956 his bowling prowess was rather an\nunknown quantity. The only occasion on which he\nwas put on to bowl was in a Sunday match, when\nhe himself was captain.\nKitch writes, 'His alertness of mind, so essential to\na cricketer, was demonstrated when he narrowly\naverted a road accident by changing the car he was\ndriving straight from fourth gear into reverse.'\nPage 68\nIn October 1959 FELIX celebrated Ken's marriage\nto Carol Weale by printing a fake obi tura ry: 'It is with a heavy heart, wet eyes, and a shaking\npen that we bring to your knowledge the sad and\ntragic 'death' of one of College's beloved servants -Dr. Weale. Whether or not his academic work, his\nUnion book-keeping or his physical exertions on the\ncricket field, rugby field, and squash court, brought\nhim to an untimely end, we shall never know. We offer\nour commiserations to all his friends, both within the\nbar and without, it is a sad day for I.C. but we must\nall go one day. P.S. Please look after him Carol.'\nKen was present at the opening of the Student\nUnion Bar on the 3rd January 1957. The first pint was\npulled by the Rector Sir Patrick Linstead and was\ndrunk by the ICU President, Kitchener. Apparently it\ncontained an overdose of sawdust thanks to all the\nlast minute work that had been going on.\nKitch recalls that they had difficulty making the door\nlock on the bar work, which encouraged them to make\na liberal interpretation of the licensing laws, much to\nthe delight of the Welsh barman, Dan Lloyd, who\nloyally stood guard, 'testing the pumps' as he put it.\nThe character of Ken Weale is summed up by the\nfollowing account of an incident at a Sunday XI game\nat Harlington:\nThe last ball of one over was fielded by Weale and\nas the captain (Kitchener) held out his hand for the\nball, Kitch said 'Christ, I don't know who to put on\nnext.' Weale said, 'I will bowl, Kitchener.' Kitch\nastonished at such a ridiculous suggestion said 'We\ndon't want things to go from bad to worse.' Weale\nreplied, 'I have the ball and I am going to bowl.'\nAs skipper Kitch was always able to grasp the\nstrategic aspects of any situation very quickly, and\nas Weale was bigger and stronger, he allowed him to\nbowl.\nThe third ball was cracked smartly in Kitch's direction at cover point and the batsman called for a single. This was a suicidal act and so it proved, though\nin rather an unexpected way. Kitch's throw was hard\nbut uncharacteristically astray. The batsman went for\na2nd, the ball bisected the wicket and awoke the mid-wicket fielder with a jolt. He hurled the ball at the\nbowler's end where Ken Weale, triumphant, removed\nthe bails for a run out. Eventually IC won the game.\nIn the beer-up, afterwards, Weale insisted that his\ncoming-on to bowl was the turning point of the game\nand claimed credit for the wicket. It transpired that\nthe mid-wicket had hurled the ball to the bowler's end,\nrather than the wicket keeper, because he wanted to\nsting Ken's hands. But Ken Weale came out on top!\nA member of every social club and a popular\nspeaker at any dinner, Ken Weale first knew FELIX as\n'a scandal sheet' that was started up in 1950. He\nremembers the students' Union as 'a sort of cottage\nindustry in the Beit Archway,' and recollects the Union\nbudget being just over \u00a35,500 in 1957. With the\nunion's a turnover in excess of \u00a32 million, Ken's task\nas senior treasurer has increased formidably from the\none he took on to 'make them (the students who\ncame to ask him) go away. Ken will be sorely missed\nas senior treasurer and FELIX wishes him well in his\nretirement.\nColin Palmer\n\n"

    "content": "Back to the Future III\nFrom out of the west they came, with the speed of\nlight, a cloud of dust and a hearty 'Hi-Yo...DeLoreon!?'. Marty McFly and Doc Emmet\nBrown ride again!\nIn the last of the trilogy of Back to the Future films,\nMarty McFly, the intrepid time traveller is sent back\nto the days of the Wild West, 1885. Doc and Marty\nare united in 1955 but Doc (the 1985 version) is now\nliving in 1885. He manages to send Marty a letter\ntelling him of where his is and a map of where he hid\nthe DeLoreon more than seventy years ago. Doc is\nmore than happy living in the Wild West so he wants\nMarty to head back to the future and disassemble the\ntime machine. However on finding the DeLoreon the\n1955 Doc and Marty also discover a photograph of\nDoc's tombstone showing he died on September 7\n1885\u2014only seven days after the Doc sent the letter\nto Marty..\nObviously Marty must travel back in time to rescue\nthe Doc from this deadly fate.\nThis he manages to do and arrives with five days\nto spare. A few hundred red indians and a cavalry\ntroop later, Marty is taken in by Seamus McFly, also\nplayed by Michael J Fox, and his family. When asked\nhis name Marty replies 'Er...Eastwood, Clint\nEastwood.' Most of the comedy in the film revolves\naround this point. Can you imagine Michael J Fox as\nClint Eastwood?\nA confrontation with Burford 'Mad Dog' Tannera distant relative of Biff-beckons next as Marty and\nDoc try desperately to fix the DeLoreon that was\ndamaged on it journey. Will they manage it in time?\nTo make matters worse, the Doc loses his heart to\na certain Miss Clara Clayton-the new school Ma'am.\nThings look bleak for even Clint Eastwood.\nThe plot is confusing in the beginning as there are\ntwo Docs to contend with, one in 1955 and one in\n1885. But all soon becomes clear even if you have\nmissed the first two films. For those who have seen\nthe earlier films, the loose ends created in Back to the\nFuture II are tied up neatly, leaving one completely\nsatisfied.\nLike the previous film, Back to the Future III is\npacked with action, comedy and drama and this time\nallows Christopher Lloyd to shine a different light-he is the real start of the film. The writers have\nprovided a good vehicle for him.\nOverall an enjoyable film and a fitting end to Marty\nMcFly's adventures, with some surprises on the way.\nJ L Wright.\nTreasure Island\nRobert Louis Stevenson's famous story has been\nresurrected again. This time they tried to produce the\ndefinitive version. When you consider the quality and\nexperience of the actors involved it should have been\nbrilliant, but what a disappointment.\nFirstly the dialogue is straight from a Sunday\nafternoon matinee with far too much pirate talk.\nPhrases like 'Ah Jim-lad' and 'shiver-me-timbers' fly\naround and make the film very dated.\nSecondly the initial acting is diabolical. Exaggerated\ngestures and labour ed conversations make the first\ntwenty minutes a chore not a pleasure.\nFinally there is nothing new added to the story. It's very commendable to be faithful to the original but\nthere must always be room to change.\nIt's not all gloom and doom. The quality of the\nactors finally breaks through the director's constraints\nwith Jim Hawkins played by Christian Bale (the boy\nfrom Empire of the Sun) producing the best\nperformance. Charlton Heston as Long John Silver\nalso produces a more than adequate performance but\nnothing more than you would have expected.\nA major disappointment is the small size of the role\ngiven to Oliver Reed and the fact that he was given\nthe part of Captain Billy Bones, a drunkard old sea-salt. He is a fine and talented actor and giving him the\nrole of a drunk can do nothing for his popular image\nor self-esteem.\nTowards the end the film defiantly picks its feet up\nand runs. Despite the fact that I knew the ending I was still engrossed by the twists and turns that keep\nyou guessing until the very end.\nOne part of the film that deserves credit is the\ncamera work, the ocean scenes are very well done\nas is the filming of the island. Also the costumes and\nmake-up are very good, giving an authentic feel to the\nfilm.\nDefinitely room for improvement but not a complete\nflop.\nIan Hodge.\nBye Bye Blues\nDaisy Cooper and her husband, Teddy, are stationed\nin India. Their life is a happy until Teddy is transferred\nto Singapore and Daisy returns to ll ling ton with her\ntwo children.\nUnfortunately the army has timed things badly,\nSingapore falls to the Japanese shortly after Teddy\narrives. Daisy has no idea if he is dead or alive.\nRunning short of money, she tries her hand as a part-time singer. Unfortunately she has a fine voice\nbut is a no-hope r when it come to the piano. With the\naid of Max she improves, but finds that their\nrelationship is becoming more than professional. With\nthe success of the band she faces a dilemma as they\nare about to set off on a tour. Does she stay with her\nchildren or go and earn desperately needed money?\nThe money wins.\nMax's intentions become less honourable and\nwithout a word from her husband in two years what\nis she to do?\nThroughout the film there are occasional songs that\nreveal what a wonderful voice Daisy, played by\nRebecca Jenkins, has. It is clear and sharp and raises\nthis film above the mediocrity that is the norm for\nmusical films.\nThe acting is also very good, Rebecca Jenkins and\nRobyn Steven who plays her young daughter have\nboth won awards and deservedly so. There is real\ncompassion and feeling and you are left guessing until\nthe end who she chooses: Teddy or Max.\nWorth a look and \"When I Sing\" is the best song I have heard in a film.\nIan Hodge.\nPage 19\n\n"

The cynic is the natural\ninhabitant of the FELIX Office, however. People who\nwork on FELIX tend to learn a great deal more about\nthe college and the union than the average student\nand it is this knowledge that fuels a growing degree\nof cynicism within them. After a year of reporting\nupon the college and the union, I cannot recollect\nmany examples of something for us all to aspire to.\nThe rector et al would love me to print those 'good\nnews' stories which appear in Network, telling of Elsie\nBassett drinking the millionth cup of tea from the\nvending machine in QT, as well as other such dull and\nbanal tales. I refuse to stoop to such depths. There\nis no such thing as good news, only news and PR.\nIdle gossip\nEverybody indulges in a little idle gossip from time to\ntime. Southside bar is full of it. Imperial College is such\na close knit community that word gets around quickly.\nLast week's death in Southside Hall is a case in point.\nWithin a day of the incident, the security guards were\nspreading rumours, 80% of which were utter rubbish.\nThe frightening part of this is that Chief of Security,\nGeoff Reeves, took part in the gossip, disseminating\nhis own flavour of bullshit. Mr Reeves should already\nbe in enough trouble since the security guard on duty\nwhen the student fell was unable to open one of the\ndoors to allow a stretcher through. The spreading of\nthese rumours merely compounds Mr Reeves' sins.\nIn the time honored fashion of any college official, Mr\nReeves has already passed the buck by saying that\nthe security guards had a key, a fact that cannot be\ndisproved. His arse was covered from day one, since\ncollege officials will always look after each other and\ncover up each other's in competencies in these sort\nof circumstances.\nThis issue\nAt 88 pages, this issue is now the biggest ever. I cannot see this record standing for long. Next year's editor, Chris Stapleton, has an ego which is even\nbigger than mine and he has probably planned a100 pager already. All this said, I believe this to be the best\nissue under my editorship. Every member of staff has\ncontributed as much time and effort as has been\nhumanly possible. The issue has been produced by\nday and night shifts, with the office running 24 hours\na day for the last ten days. The issue represents more\nman hours than I could even begin to calculate.\nAlthough it hardly seems much, I have to thank\nWouter van Hulten for the cover design, which was\nprinted in the ICU Print Unit, and, specifically, the\nfollowing superheroes, many of whom were working\n20 hours on, and 4 off, per day: Jeremy Burnell, Jason\nLander, Adam Tinworth, Toby Jones, Liz Warren,\nRichard Eyers, and Ian Hodge. Thanks also to all of\nthe contributors for this issue; there are too many to\nmention. The list at the end of this editorial is designed\nto be one for the complete year.\nGoodbye\nDespite my jaundiced views, I have enjoyed my year\nas FELIX editor. The year has been all too brief; I just\nabout seem to have the knack of it now. If anybody\nis still looking for the regrets I mentioned earlier, I have\nnone. This has been a memorable experience, and I hope it will prove so for Chris next year. Goodbye to\nall those people I have known at Imperial and hello\nbrave new world.

    "content": "These contain characteristics which indicate control\nand lack of control (sections I left and I right\nrespectively), introversion and extroversion (sections\nII left and II right), and lack of joie de viv re and ability\nto enjoy life (sections III left and III right). Each major\nsection can be divided into further segments, using\na variety of handwriting features. Here six features\nin each section are used to demonstrate how the\noverall picture of the character may be constructed.\nTo analyse a sample of handwriting, at least 15 lines\nof script is needed, preferably on blank paper. In order\nto test certain categories, such as how broad the\nwriting is, it is important that the writer is using a writing implement with which they feel comfortable.\nEach of the features is taken in turn and judged as\nto whether the sample indicates tension or release for\nthat characteristic (or is neutral, for example upright\nwriting with no slant either way). It is rated from 1\n(slight tendency) to 4 (exaggerated) and the section\nof the segment corresponding to that score is shaded\nin, with the inner section being 1 and the outer section\n4. When complete, the shading pattern provides an\ninsight into the balance and tension with the sample.\nSamples are reproduced in Box 2 which are\naccompanied by a basic assessment of whether each\nfeature lies in tension or release for that sample.\nFurther explanation of certain features can be found\nin Box 1, When the degree of tension has been\ndetermined for each section, Table 1 is used to\ntranslate the handwriting feature into a general\npersonality trait.\nThe form level of the sample\nAnother type of analysis is based on the 'Form Level'\nof the sample, after the methods of Dr Robert Saudek.\nThis is a combination of characteristics relating to\nspeed, spacing and originality. In general, the higher\nthe standard of writing and spacing, the more positive\nwill be the interpretation of other factors.\nFor example, slow copy book handwriting,\nprojecting little originality or intellectual leaning, will\nbe written by a monotonous, st ero typed and\nunimaginative individual-a follower rather than a leader; this would merit a poor Form Level indicating\nplainness and a mundane character.\nA high Form Level might be merited by originality\nof letter forms with emphasis on graceful quality,\nsimplicity and legibility. These are expressive of the\nwriter's productive ability and intelligent ideas. The\ncreative and logical thinker will write without\nadornment but not to the point of neglect. Neglect of\nletter form and also a disorder of spacing point to\nd is organisation and intellectual disturbance, such as\nconfusion in comprehension.\nThere are several aspects of form which are of\ninterest to the graphologist. The length of the initial\nstroke, if any, is indicative of the degree of inner\npreparation that the writer needs before starting a task. No initial stroke at all is a positive factor in\ndetermining Form Level.\nThe formation of the personal pronoun T( PPI)\nrelates to self-image. An enrolled ' I' with curls at both\nends is indicative of greed. A straight 'I', narrow and\nsimple, is a natural response, for a writer who wishes\nto be seen as he/she actually is. A complicated and\nenriched PPI expresses feelings of self-worth and is\noften an over-compensation for an inferiority complex.\nCircle 'i' dots show immature attitudes, and a false\nattempt to project an image of sophistication. The dot\nconnected to the next letter shows a quick and agile\nmind.\nLow 't' bars belong to the inflexible person. High\n't' bars, if touching the stem, indicate ability to lead\nand take control, if detached from the stem a dominance of social interests is indicated. As with the\n'i' dot, when joined to the next letter, the 't' bar\ndisplays a quick and agile mind.\nLower loops, especially in the letters 'g' and 'y', are\nthe most important indication of sexual maturity and\nimagination. As such, it might be unwise to include\ntoo many examples here which may be seen as\nlibellous. Suffice to say that the longer the loop the\nbetter! Wide loops, open and to the left, display\ncontemplation, openness to sensual impressions with\na poetic attitude to the sensual world. If the loop\nclaws back from the left towards the end of the\nstroke, greed and egoism are the order of the day.\nThe left margin shows how the writer utilise s his\nresources. Width points to generosity and pride. A writer whose left margin widens as the the writing\nprogresses down the page is impulsively motivated\nand saves time but at the expense of accuracy. The\nwriter appreciates new projects as a welcome release\nfrom mundane activities. Such people tend to lose\ncontrol. Sometimes a writer will become aware of the\nwidening margin in the text and will pull himself back\ninto line with each new paragraph. Thus the impulsive\nnature is controlled.\nSignatures\nSignatures are never analysed without a sample of the\nnormal handwriting. The general script represents\nwhat the writer is and the signature represents the\nimage that the writer wishes to project to others.\nWhen the signature and body of the script are alike,\nthere is little discrepancy between the writer's private\nand public life. A signature that is smaller than the\nscript will show an individual who has a low profile\nof modesty, inhibition and shyness.\nSimilarly, a signature larger than the script exhibits\nan image of importance and stature-a desire to be\nrecognised. Legible signatures indicate a person\nwilling to honour commitments, being sincere and\nreliable, with a good balance of expressiveness in\npersonality. A completely illegible and complicated\nsignature is adopted by the vain character who\nconsiders himself superior.\nThe initial stroke of a signature is often used as a flamboyant springboard into the rest of the motion.\nThis shows a need for continuous advancement in\nbusiness and social circles, and an active drive and\naggression. When written in one conti nous movement, the writer is logically oriented and\nunwilling to be interrupted in his thoughts. A heavy\nfull stop after a signature represents an opinionated\nand obstinate attitude. As a final note on signatures,\nif the name is cancelled out by a score finishing to the\nleft, the writer has very low self-esteem, and when\nthe crossing out is carried out with heavy pressure,\nthe writer has no desire to carry on with life as it is.\nGraphology in the real world\nOn reflection, one might be dismayed that so much\ndetailed information might be gleaned from such an\nopen and commonly used form of personal\ncommunication. It must be stressed that in highly\nconfidential situations, especially with regard to\npersonnel selection, graphology is generally used as\na tool only at the short-list stage. It is an aid to\nconfirming underlying impressions that an interviewer\nmay have developed, in order to give a more complete\npicture of the candidate.\nThe fact that a grapho logical analysis does form part\nof the selection procedure in many companies is not\nin doubt. In small businesses, where the compatibility\nof employees is crucial to the success of the\ncompany, graphology has an even more important role\nto play. As with all such psycho metric tests, though,\ngraphology is never used as a screening implement\nin its own right.\nThe equilibrium of handwriting and personality is\ncontinually shifting. As the character changes through\nlearning and response to influences, so the adaptive\nprocess causes sub con cio us modifications in the\nhandwriting. These effects are often minimal, but\nwhen accumulated can suddenly reveal a different\nperson, just as minute shifts in personality ultimately\nproduce a new person.\nIt is certainly useful to know when you fill in those\napplication forms that your writing may well be\nexamined in detail, that certain hints about your\ncharacter may be drawn from this analysis, and that\nthis may influence the direction that an interviewer\nmight take. Knowing what tell-tale signs might be\ngiven away by your handwriting can only serve to\nprepare you better for the selection process.\nThe candidate cannot afford to be sceptical about\ngraphology-it is a science which has academic\nsupport and which possesses enough credibility for\nmajor companies to be serious about its use in\npersonnel selection. In an increasingly competitive job\nmarket, every possible means to select the best\ncandidate will be used. Forewarned is forearmed.\nBOX 2 SAMPLE A SAMPLE Bc p Release-number only: tension-denoted by A: neutral- denoted by N Segment number 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 1 1 12 13 14 15 16 17 18\nSample AN23 A45 A6 NNNN11 A12N1415 A16N1718 Sample 6 N23456N89 A10 AN12N1415161718 Page 40\n\n"

    "content": "High life in London\nO A, Adam Harrington\nThe one thing that makes a big, dirty, ugly city like\nLondon bearable is its music. Contemporary rock and\npop venues are expensive and very well publicised.\nWhilst classical music is not exactly 'cheap', it is\ncheaper and is on every night in a number of places.\nSo if you are bored with the insistent ratatat at at of\nS, A and W and want something more subtle than\nMeatloaf, try music that in many cases has been going\nstrong for over two hundred years.\nThe Wigmore Hall is located at 36 Wigmore street,\nthe nearest tube is Bond Street. Ticket office 935\n2141. Student standbys can be bought one hour\nbefore the performance - they are the best available\nseating at the lowest price (usually \u00a34).\nThe hall is hidden behind a small porch (in the\ndrawing). It is a rectangular room decorated in the\n1920's style. It is good for chamber music and any\nsmall scale performances.\nThe South Bank Centre is between Waterloo and\nHungerford bridges on the south bank of the Thames.\nThe nearest tube is Embankment and involves a walk\nover Hungerford bridge. This is not advised late at\nnight if you are alone. Ticket office 928 3002.\nStandbys are sold two hours before the performance.\nPrices vary according to the popularity of the\nconcert-i.e.a programme including Mozart's Eine\nKleine Nachtmusik will be upwards of \u00a35 whilst the\nlatest horror from Phillip Glass may be \u00a32.\nThe Royal Festival Hall is a big auditorium for music\non a grand scale. It also hold occ a is ional poetry\nrenditions.\nThe Queen Elizabeth Hall and Purcell Room next\ndoor are for smaller scale works. The Queen Elizabeth\nHall is a nasty cavern of wood and concrete.\nThe centre is a good venue for most music but the\narchitecture is gross. The interval cafe is expensive\nand the place is always full of trendies or down-and-outs. The walk across the footbridge is frequently\nnerve-w racking.1 '\u2022\u2022\u00ab-/ mm Wigmore Hall\nPage 52\nSt Martin's in-the-Fields in Trafalgar square. The\nnearest tube is Charing Cross, but the most\nconvenient is Embankment, which is only a few yards\ndistant. Ticket office 839 1930. Concessions for\nstudents are \u00a31 off the full price (\u00a33 to \u00a34) and\nlunchtime concerts are free, with a \u00a31 donation\nexpected.\nThe church has occasional concerts on Saturday\nevenings and rarely on other evenings. Lunchtime\nconcerts (1.00pm) occur on Mondays and Tuesdays\nand sometimes other days.\nIt is a beautiful 18th century church which\neverybody sees when they visit the square. A superb\nsetting for baroque or early classical music.\n\n"

It would be helpful\nif you could\ninclude your age\nand the area you\nlive in.\nUnfortunately,\nAnna and Dingly\nare unable to\nanswer letters\nprivately.\nDRUNK PARTY We have received several\nletters on the following\ntheme:\nI went to a party last\nFriday. It was a dinner and\nthere was lots of alcohol\naround. It was really good\nfun, but I got very drunk\nand I don't remember a lot\nof what I did. People keep\ncoming up to me and\ntelling me I did lots of\ndreadful things that I can't remember, like molesting\nseveral members of the\nopposite sex.\nI don't know whether to believe them, but I'm really\nembarrassed. What should\nI do?\nA Jason Donovan Fan, S Kensington\n\u2022\nIt was very silly of you\nto drink so much. And\nyes, you did do all those\nthings everyone said and I'm never going to speak to you\nagain! The bet's off.\nPARANOIA I have to spend a lot of\ntime making speeches to\nyoung people. Over the\npast four years, I 've\nbecome very worried that\nthey don't really respect\nme and that they are\nlaughing at me behind my\nback. I also worry that\nthey are writing nasty\nthings about me and\npassing these around.\nIam keen to encourage\nyoung people into taking\nup a sport and a social\nactivity and I also like\nadvising them on aspects\nof DIY, such as painting\nrooms. However, I'm worried that this isn't having the right effect on them. Do you think I'm being paranoid?\nA Kylie Fan, Queensgate.\n\u2022\nPerhaps the young\npeople you're talking to\nfind you distant and\nunapproachable. Remember\nthat young people don't like\nbeing condescended to. If you\nrespect them, I'm sure they'll\nrespect you.\nI don't think you have to worry\nabout them writing things\ndown about you. After all, not\nmany people will see it.\nPerhaps you should moderate\nyou enthusiasm for your\nhobbies. After all, not\neveryone shares them.\nEXAM FEAR Iam just about to start a new\njob. To get it I had to be\nvelvety, sabre toothed, ice-cool and satirical. Iam really\nlooking forward to it, but I have one small problem. I have just taken some exams\nand if I don't pass them, I won't be able to do the job.\nI have had trouble\nacademically over the past\nfive years, having to retake\nseveral sets of exams. I 've\nalways managed to scrape\nthrough in the past, but I won't be allowed to retake\nthese and I'm really worried.\nI tried working hard for them,\nbut I'm very frightened I haven't done well enough.\nI'm so worried, my hairline\nhas started receding and I 've\nstarted smoking lots more\nthan usual. What can I do?\nA Rick Astley Fan, W Kensington.\n\u2022\nIf your exams are, its too\nlate to do anything. You\nshould have worked harder\nearlier. But I'm sure if you don't pass, there are lots of other\nthings you can do, like work for\nHarrods.\nSOCIAL WORRY My hubby has just gotten a Knighthood from your cute\nlittle English Queen and I guess we'll be meeting\nsome pretty important\npeople now. I'm just a little worried I won't know what to do. I mean, in\nAmerica we don't have all\nthis class thing and I guess\nit wouldn't go down too\nwell if I called your queen\n'Lizzie', would it?\nI also guess I don't really\nknow what to do with all\nthat cutlery you get at\nthese posh occasions. Only\nlast week, my hubby had\nto tell me not to eat my melon with the steak knife.\nWhat can I do?\nA Sonya Fan, Queensgate\n\u2022\nI recommend Emily\nPost's book of etiquette.\nThat should put your mind at\nrest on all the important\npoints. But etiquette is\nbecoming less important these\ndays as I'm sure you know.\nRemember, the most important\nway to make sure you're not\ntoo rude is not to impose\nyourself too much on other\npeople.\nDISASTER Iam very worried about a problem which seems to have haunted me\nthroughout my life. I seem\nto be disaster prone.\nWhatever I become\ninvolved in always seems\nto turn into a nightmare,\nwhich takes more time to solve than the original\nproblem. My job requires a lot of organisation, which I just don't seem capable of.\nI have tried taking brick\nlaying lessons and have\neven attempted to learn\nsomething about\ncomputers. The results of\nmy labours are a pile of\nrubble and a bargain\nbasement, full of\nnetworked ZX Spectrums.\nI want to change, but my dumb hunk nature seems\nto stop me every time.\nA Meatloaf fan Wales(B'A) \u2022\nYour case seems a hopeless one. You\nshould retire from your job and\ntake up a career in hod\ncarrying. The photograph you\nhave enclosed seems to\nindicate that you may be able\nto carry the bricks with the aid\nof your enlarged, alcoholic\nmidriff instead of a hod. If hod\ncarrying proves too mentally\nstrenuous and responsible a position for you, why not try\ngrave digging\u2014you seem quite\ngood at making your own.\n\n"

    "content": "STA manager Roy Hughes and Wendy Parks describe experiences of a mini world tour and how to plan one.\nCatching the travel bu\nIt is not inconceivable that in the darkest recesses of\neach of Britain's universities there is a meteorological\ndepartment with the sole responsibility of ensuring\nthat during the period leading up to exams the weather\nwill be extremely hot, sticky and generally not very\nconducive to spending hours locked away in a library,\nbedroom or wherever else silent sanctuary is to be\nfound. For most people this is an intolerable situation,\nfor experienced travellers it is the nearest thing to\npurgatory and for others this is the time that the\nembryonic idea of 'getting away from it all' takes\nserious root.\nSo what constitutes 'getting away from it all'? For\nsome people it is nothing more complicated than two\nweeks of hedonistic pleasure in a mediterranean\nhotspot; for others it is an Inter-Rail pass, a tent and\na stout pair of hiking boots. Some hardy souls,\nobviously deeply disturbed by an excess of academia,\nbeg, steal or borrow the required finances and set off\non a round-the-world ticket (purchased from STA, of\ncourse). A prerequisite for this latter group is a sense\nof adventure and/or a degree of temporary insanity.\nFor all potential travellers the easy part is deciding\nto go. Difficulties begin to arise when choosing a suitable destination (or destinations). I have lost count\nof the number of people I have spoken to over the last\ntwo years with STA, who have uttered those near\nWalthamstow-ish classic lines; 'I want to go on\nholiday but I don't know where'. ('There are people\nin the air...they think it's all over...'.) Unfortunately\nfor me these people usually expect an immediate\nsolution-as a matter of interest, my usual answer is\n'Laos', as I have yet to meet anybody who has\nsuccessfully negotiated their way either in or out of\nthe country. On the other hand there are people who\ncollect 'sets' of countries; one of our intrepid\nconsultants in another branch of STA went to the\nextremes of visiting Tirana in Albania sometime last\nyear so he could complete his 'European set'. I have\nto admit to being one of these irritating people and\nI am, at present, working on a collection of 'One Party\nStates' which is quite an interesting one as new ones\ncrop up all the time, while others disappear.\nAs some indication to where independent travellers\nare heading for at the moment, I would tentatively say\n(after a quick straw poll in the office) that the most\npopular destinations are the perennial favourite, the\nUSA, and a relative newcomer, Thailand. The latter\nis fast becoming the Hawaii of South East Asia, so\nit would be advisable to get there before it's too late.\nA couple to watch out for in the future could be\nIndonesia (especially Sumatra) and a rank outsider The\nMaldives; a factor not entirely unconnected to the fact\nthat they are sinking and it is somewhat of a novelty\nto visit islands that might not actually be there in ten\nyears time. Whatever your final choice of destination,\nthe next step is usually the most difficult, the pre-travel preparations.\n'SvVAYAMBHUNATH' THE MONKEY TEMPLE. KATHMAMDU\nIt was during my student years that I caught the\n'travel bug', backpacking around Europe as much as\ntime and money would allow. Although I then settled\ninto a teaching job, I longed to travel further afield and\nafter two years I started making plans for a year's trip.\nThese plans and the necessary preparations took me\nalmost six months.\nMy first task was to decide where I wanted to go.\nI read books and brochures which made me want to\ngo to almost every destination inthe world. Studying\nthe seasons, I laboriously worked out a round the\nworld route which avoided the monsoons as much as\npossible. I took this route to a few travel agents for\na quote, but when figures in excess of \u00a33,000 were\nthrown at me I decided it was time to rethink! I also\nbecame more realistic about just how much of the\nworld I could see in a year. This became even more\napparent once I had travelled for a while and I realised\nthat the more countries or towns I tried to visit the\nless I actually gained-it was impossible to scrape\nbelow the surface if I was constantly on the move.\nI would be travelling alone for three months through\nAsia before arriving in Australia to spend Christmas\nwith friends. As I was unsure at this stage about being\nin Asia on my own, I found out about a number of\ntreks and tours specifically geared towards budget\ntravellers. While I was busy sorting out my route and\na tour I also had to work through a long list of many\nmundane and time consuming procedures: obtaining\na new passport, relevant visas, international driving\nlicence and YHA card, insurance, making several visits\nto the doctor for a series of in no cul at ions and then\nequip ing myself with a new rucksack, walking boots,\nsleeping bag and other necessities.\nMeanwhile, the actual trip was falling into place. I had booked to go on a trek in Northern India in\nSeptember and then in November I would go on a tour\nfrom Kathmandu to Bali. All I needed was a flight to\nDelhi and then a flight from Bali to Australia, I was\nquite impressed how well I'd cut down my flights\nalthough the planning had taken me so long that by\nthe time I returned to STA to book them the cheapest\nfares were already full.\nAnd so for the first three months everything was\nrigidly planned. I went on the trek in Northern India\nand then travelled overland to Nepal where I spent a month before joining the tour that was to take me to\nBali in an astounding five weeks...While this tour\noffered me security and a hassle free trip, I found it\nfrustrating travelling through five countries at such\nspeed and not having any real contact with the people\nand their ways of life and so I was quite relieved to\nspend another two weeks in Bali on my own after the\ntour had finished. During this time I developed a real\nlove for the island, with its beautiful scenery,\nincredibly friendly people and relaxing lifestyle, and\nI made the decision to return at some point. It should\nbe noted that there are two sides to Bali -the southern\ntip of the island is to Australia what Benidorm is to\nthe UK-for people who just want to drink, eat and\nsurf cheaply it's great, but Kuta is not Bali.\nFortunately, it is easy to get away from the tourist\narea and elsewhere in Bali, life continues as it has for\nhundreds of years...with a culture that is fascinating\nand unique.\nI flew on to Australia just before Christmas and\nsuffered from culture shock for the first time since\nleaving home! I spent the next two months visiting\nfriends and picking fruit to earn some quick money.\nI then headed for the bright lights of Sydney, where\nPage 76\nI bumped into a girl who I'd first met in Bali. Before\nlong we decided to travel together, with Bali as our\nfinal destination.\nWe travelled mostly by arranged lifts, as advertised\non hostel noticeboards, and had one adventure after\nanother. It was by far the best time I had in Australia.\nWe took a month to travel from Sydney along the\ncoast to Cairns to see the Great Barrier Reef and then\nacross the outback to Darwin.\nHere we discovered flights to Bali were not as cheap\nas we had hoped for but we could fly to Timor for\n\u00a3250 return. We were also told we could leave the\nnext day and as we were desperate to leave Australia\nby this point we spent the rest of the day rushing\naround like demented ants getting injections,\ntravellers cheques, etc.\nThe next two months were superb as we travelled\nacross the lesser known islands of Timor, Sumba,\nFores and Lombok before reaching Bali. Tourists have\nyet to reach these islands, which means conditions\nare basic, but the people are very friendly and were\nalways inviting us to their homes and giving us food.\nThis was sometimes difficult coming to terms with,\nin the light of their relative poverty. I loved Indonesia\nso much that I ended up spending a further four\nmonths on my own in Timor, Bali and then travelling\non through Java and Sumatra. I was so glad at this\npoint that I had not booked any onward flights from\nAustralia before I'd left home as this allowed me to\nbe more flexible. I eventually made my way up to\nPenang from Sumatra and spent a final five weeks in\nThailand before buying a cheap flight back to London\nfrom Kuala Lumpur.\nDANCER \u00b0 \u00a5 OO BANGKOK\nON THE, BEACH\nAUSTRALIA.\nWherever you want\nto go\nWe'll get you there\nfor less\nLow Cost Flights on Quality\nAirlines\nSpecial Fares for Students\nWeekend Breaks, Tours &\nGroup Bookings\nWell Travelled Staff to\nGuide You\nOver 100 Offices\nWorldwide\nUL U TRAVEL Sherfield Building\nImperial College\n\\W4WA BT A ULU TRAVEL\nPage 77\n\n"

    "content": "Madonna\n-I'm Breathless LP\nA change in style for Madonna? Ha, understatement\nof the decade.\nThis album, set in the 1930s around the movie Dick\nTracy, should never have been released as an\nindependent Madonna album; though Madonna injects\nall the tracks with her talent and vitality, it still sounds\nlike the soundtrack to Anniel The further one\nprogresses with the album, the more one gets the\nfeeling that the whole thing has been produced\nSoup Dragons\n-Love God LP\nLovegod is the second LP by the Soup Dragons, Sean\nDickinson & Tribe, preceded by the excellent lifted\nsingle Mother Universe. As with Mother Universe, the\nwhole album shows a total change in direction, to a mellow, beat based sound. Though excellent material,\nunfortunately, fated to pass the same way as the\nsingle: 'the single? we never heard of it!', you may\nsay. Exactly my point.\nEach track follows the same basic format of ebbing\nvocals and guitars over a backing bass and drum\n(machine-might as well be) beat. Each track leaves\nan impression, but leaves nothing stronger, nothing\ndemanding or attention seeking; sometimes a line will\ninfiltrate for its classic value alone, overall each track\nin turn washes nicely but effortlessly by.\nOn the basis of simplicity, dominating attitudes\noscillate somewhere between two extremes, from the\nraunchy expressiveness of Drive the Pain or Kiss the\nGun, to the mes m eric mellowness of Softly or\nSweetmeat; appreciation rises and falls between\ndiffering moods.\nOn a good day, buy the record, catch a crest of the\nSoupies and enjoy riding on it.\nDEL.\ntongue-in-cheek and it is a big joke; but it can't be can\nit?\nA lot of it sinks into basic 1930s female vocalist\ntracks but some cannot go without mention for their\nnovelty value. The first such track, Hanky Panky, is\nas the title suggests about kinky sex, but it takes\nsome listening to to believe she really is singing 'hanky\npan ky,I like a bit of spanky' and 'tie my hands behind\nmy back and ooh I'm in ecstasy'! I'm Going Bananas\nis Madonna doing exactly that, but in a very energetic\ncalypso way. Something to Remember is a classic\nMadonna love track which she sings with true felt\nemotion. If only it wasn't in the middle of the album...\nNow I'm Following You (Parts I and III is a brilliant\nwaltz around the dancefloor with Madonna; on the\nsecond attempt she adds a dance beat to help it along\nand if it didn't have the awful samples from the film's bits, it could be a classic dance track. Well a novel\none anyway.\nVogue sits uncomfortably on the end, totally out of\nplace. It may be a good dance track, but thank God\nthe whole album didn't turn out like that.\nThe album is good if you like Madonna, or the film\nDick Tracy when it is released. It's very confusing to\nknow how to take it: seriously?\nDEL.\nI Like Danny's Hair\n-Trapdoor 22.5.90\nThe hair was everywhere, but who was Danny?\nPerhaps he was the obscene 5ft inflatable killer whale\nor the giant pink rabbit\nThey threatened to be brilliant. The raw guitars\ndevoured the subtle synths and the erotic whale\naroused some obvious pleasure in the singer. A pounding version of a Doors classic became\nmonumental, but from then onwards the songs just\ngot cornier and the technology took over.\nShamelessly, they sang about 'Fatso' and 'Printing'\nChe's not a Yankee, he's a printer'?). As the synths\ndevoured the subtle guitars, the Billy Idol lookalike's greatest challenge became to start the drum machine\nand sequencer in synch, and so, after achieving\nsuccess, he dropped his trousers for the delighted\naudience.\nThey destroyed Greased Lightning in a torrent of\nblips and echoes, whilst on some tracks the whole\nband were redundant. So the maniacs pranced over\nthe stage or tried asphyxiation by wearing rubber\ngloves as hats. Who needs 'live' music when you've\ngot a digital sampling sequencer?\nGreat for a cabaret-good all-round non-family\nentertainment at it's most sordid-but where's the\nmusic gone?\nSJH.\nInspiral Carpets\n-Live LP\nScally sensation? Cool as F***??I was dying to find\nout, when prejudice and good taste stopped me in my\ntracks.\nAfter pulling out the record sleeve to find, to my\nhorror, the picture on the right, could you expect me\nto continue with the review?\nDEL\nill iH;. vr\nMorrissey\n-Hulmerist VIDEO\nIf you hold any interest in Morrissey you'll enjoy the\nvideos: an overall reflection on Morrissey, his\nManchester humour and devoted fans.\nThe promo videos are interspersed with clips of his\nfree Wolverhampton gig from '88; unless of course\nyou were there yourself, when the video would be\nmore of a visual moment o interspersed with the\npromo videos.\nMorrissey whilst in The Smiths was a devout nonbeliever in video, so a certain naivet e is evident,\nthough overcome with some strong imagery.\nLast of the Famous International Playboys, though\nan excellent song, is his first and most disappointing\nvideo. Sister I'm a poet is shot from live footage and\nemphasises Morrissey's idol is ed image as fans swarm\nthe stage to touch, kiss or hold him. Every Day is Like\nSunday has some brutally attacking shots; 'Cruelty\nwithout Beauty' scrawled on a subtle postcard digs\ndeep. Interesting Drug with its schoolboys in high\nheels, shocks but gives no real impression. Suedehead\nis a tribute to James Dean, showing Morrissey has\nused the videos to express what he wants to see.\nOuija Board, Ouija Board is a manic video around a sinister but brilliantly expressed song, starring Joan\nSimms of Carry On fame. Finally November spawned\na monster is a totally underrated track with a excellent\nvideo. Set in Death Valley, Morrissey takes the\nsparsity and void around him and wraps himself in it\nto show his angst, captured with some striking\ncamera shots.\nIf you enjoy Morrissey, this is a collection he really\nseems to enjoy.\nDEL\nPage 7\n\n"
