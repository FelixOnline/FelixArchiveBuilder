It is\nthe largest event in Western\nEurope and all the top club,\ncollege and university crews\nenter together with national\nsquad-based crews and several\nforeign clubs.\nThe 1st VIII came tenth\noverall out of 420 entries, taking\n18min10s.

The novice eight\ncame a creditable 234th. Following the extra long\nEaster break of four days,\ngenerously given by coach Bill\nMason, the senior squad returned to racing at the smaller\nscale Bedford Head. Over the\nshorter 2,000m course, Imperial\nCollege took three out of the\nfirst four places in the fours\nevent, winning senior A and\nsenior B fours. They also picked\nup the trophies for senior A cox less pairs and novice sculls.\nThis was the final head race of\nthe winter and so the squad had\nto return to intense training to\nprepare for the side by side\nracing of regattas.

Despite a fast start by TTRC,\nthe 1st VIII soon hit their\nrhythm and pulled away to win\nby two lengths. The Senior A cox less four won with ease as did\nthe Senior B cox ed four and the\nelite cox less pair.

Even the hand-dryer was functional. All that\nwas required was a nail brush,\nalthough had there been one it\nwould probably have been\npinched. In my eighteen months\nat College this is the first time I have witnessed such an event.\nYours in astonishment\nGareth Fish\nIt Wasn't Me\nDear Sir\nI imagine that even the most\nardent champions of FELIX\nwould hardly claim that its\nreports are renowned for their\naccuracy and veracity. The\narticle you published under the\nheading 'Warding off Lauwerys'\nin the issue of March 23 must\nsurely, however, represent a new\nlandmark in creative journalism.\nIt was apparently a report of the\nStudent Residence Committee\nmeeting held on March 21 and\nincluded the following state-ment s: \u2014If Mr J Lauwerys goes ahead\nwith the plans he proposed at a student/staff committee on\nMonday...\n\u2014The meeting...had a double\npurpose: for the Union to\nquestion Mr Lauwerys on his\nreport on residence manage-ment...\nand finally, best of all,\n\u2014Mr Lauwerys seemed unable\nto bring forward very good\narguments in favour of the\nproposal except...\nThis latter inability may have\nhad some bearing on the fact\nthat I wasn't at the meeting at\nany point during the day, nor\nhad it ever been intended that I should be present!\nI remain a devoted reader.\nYours sincerely\nJohn Lauwerys\nTea Mines\nSir\nThe Mines Coffee Room\nAttendant would like it to be\nknown that AK Waner, all\nstreaming hor ds of parasitic\nstudents, ICU hacks, physicists,\ndisgruntled Life Science students\nand staff, and all other social\nmisfits, plus Mrs Shirley Veary\nand Professor Wood, will all be\nmade most welcome at our first\nfloor haven of succulent treasures; the Mines drinks machine\noperates twelve hours a day\neveryday.

At present it is still\ntoo early to make many positive\nsteps towards looking for\naccommodation as most landlords are not prepared to\ncommit their property this far in\nadvance. Student Services do\nhave a few addresses of flats for\nnext year mainly for share rs but\nunfortunately we won't know\nabout the bulk of available\naccommodation until September. The new updated ac com mo*da to in guide should be available\nfrom Student Services shortly\nand this will give you some\ngeneral hints about accommodation in the private sector. In\nthe meantime it may be worth at\nleast thinking about what sort of\naccommodation you may be\ninterested in, and perhaps\ngetting a group of friends\ntogether, as accommodation\nfor share rs is often easier to Find\nthan flats for one or two people\nYou could also try asking\naround any final year students\nyou know who may be living in\nrented ac como dati on as some\nlandlords are happy to offer\naccommodation to one group of\nstudents on the recommendation\nof the present tenants if you have\nany specific difficulties, then call\ninto Student Services and we\nmay be able to help.\nYour ticket to exam success?\nOnce again the exam season is\nupon us and students everywhere begin to burn the midnight oil, poring over long\nforgotten textbooks.

    "content": "Sophistry\nfor Sophie\nSo here we are once again, back for another\nCollege term, and more importantly another\nissue of that literary lion and bastion of the\nstudent's right to know. But what of the film\nworld? What has Hollywood served up in\nrecent weeks to tempt you from your books?\nWell, a lot happened in the film world since\nlast term. The much hyped academy awards\nhave been distributed, every one has predicted\nthe rebirth of the British film industry and\nHollywood has continued to pump releases at\nus at a rate of a couple a week. The awards\nthemselves were a bit of a sham; the slight of\n'Dahling' Dicky Attenborough trying to mount\nthe stage once again under the increasing\n.weight of golden gongs to tell us what an\nhonour and a privilege it all was, was highly\namusing. No doubt Spielberg cried all the way\nback to his modest little spread and went on a guided tour of his bank balance to cheer\nhimself up.\nMeryl Streep deservedly won the award for\nbest actress in the title role of Sophies\nChoice, now playing at the Empire Leicester\nSquare, based on the novel by William Styron.\nStingo (Peter MacNichol) moves into a boarding house in Brooklyn to try and fulfil his\nambition of becoming a writer and writing the\ngreat American novel. Unfortunately the\nnocturnal peace of his refuge is disturbed by a couple upstairs setting to with the sort ot gusto\nthat has been known to cause structural\ndamage. Stingo, as Styron's alter ego.\neventually meets the energetic pair and is\nswept into their intense charisma. Nathan is .1\nvolatile brilliant Jewish intellectual, supposedly\na biophysicist at the nearby university, and\nSophie is a Polish Catholic refugee from\nEurope, a survivor of Auschwitz. The film is\nStingo's story of an idealised Brooklyn\nsummer as he narrates the story of his\ninvolvement with the enigmatic Sophie and the\nmanic quixotic Nathan (Kevin Kline).\nWhat might have become a comedy about\na happy menage-a trois doing loony things in\nBrooklyn becomes high melodrama as the film\nprogresses and we realise that theirs is a desperate sort of happiness. Sophie is trying to\nescape from a past she cannot face which is\ntold in a flashback sequence when she reveals\nher secret to Stingo. Nathan is not merely\ntempestuous and emotional, but a paranoid\nschizophrenic barely able to keep control and\ntotally reliant on Sophie. This central\nrelationship is one of the best double acts on\nthe screen for many years. Both accomplished\nperformers, Streep and Kline really strike\nsparks off each other. Streep is at her\nsuperlative best and having demonstrated she\ncan master a Devonshire burr in French\nLieutenant, she now adopts a mid-European\naccent of equal persuasion. This is a part\nwhich Ms Streep initially rejected and then\nhaving read the script, begged to be given after\nMeryl Streep and Kevin Kline play the doomed lovers in Sophie's Choice.\nPage 6 ^ HH BB H W^^H BH B WB BH H WW BBBB HB WH i^ FILM Elizabeth McGovern-a professional problem\nit had already been cast (the couch is this\nway my dear...) and she certainly gives it\neverything she's got. A somewhat typecast\npart for her, having had experience of\nconcentration camp tragedy in Holocaust, but\nshe's easily the best dramatic actress on the\nscreen. Perhaps she might try some lighter\nroles next.\nSpeaking of which brings us nicely to\nLovesick, Cert 15, directed by Marshall Brickman now playing at the Warner West End,\nwhich stars cuddly Dudley and Elizabeth\nMcGovern. A few weeks ago I predicted that\nManagement Consultants would be the focal\nprofession in Hollywood; unfortunately my\nhopes have been dashed as yet another film\ntakes a humorous sideswipe at that oldest of\nHollywood foils, the shrink. The profession of\npsychoanalysis has a love-hate relationship\nwith Hollywood; directors and performers\nkeep the Hollywood shrinks in business: but\nthey cannot resist the occasion attempt to\nexpose the whole profession as a bunch of\ngreedy charlatans. Dudley Moore plays Dr\nSaul Benjamin who 'inherits' Chloe Allen (Miss\nMcGovern) when her regular psychiatrist dies\nsuddenly. He immediately becomes obsessed\nwith her (who can blame him?) and she\nlikewise. He fights again t his twin bur der s of\nmarital guilt and his professional ethics,\npersonified by the mystical appearance of Dr\nSigmun Freud (Sir Alec Guinness).\nObvious comparisons will be made between\nthis film and the recently televised 10. There is\nthe same rich easy lifestyle suddenly disrupted\nby a frantic pursuit of a woman, which\nthreatens to ruin his career. But whereas 10\nwas a sex comedy, albeit of a rather\nun sensational nature, this is a romantic\ncomedy and the casting emphasises it. Instead\nof the sensual Bo Derek we have the impish\nand vulnerable Elizabeth McGovern. But\nfor Dr Benjamin.\nwhile Ms Derek's cold sexuality left me rather\nunmoved. Ms McGovern was a revelation to a hopeless romantic like myself. The heart\nfluttered, the mouth dried and the legs turned\nto jelly; she is a vision, the sort of girl you could\ntake home to mummy with no trepidation\n(form a queue behind me please). Dudley\nMoore's performance is as good as we've\ncome to expect. He must have one of the\nlongest and most varied comic pedigrees\naround, from Derek and Clive to Jackanory.\nThis performance is a nice mixture of the\nabsurd, slapstick and pathos. In my opinion\nthis film is superior to its notorious\npredecessor.\nAlso passed over at the Ghandi award\ncer monies, Tootsie, cert PG, directed by\nSydney Pollack now playing at the Odeon\nLeicester Square, starring Dustin Hoffman is\nsuperficially a comedy but actually works on\nseveral different levels. It is the story of a 'serious' but um employed actor, Michael\nDorsey, who needs to raise some money to\nproduce a friend's play. Unable to get work\nbecause of his reputation as a difficult actor, he\ndecides to audition for a female part in a long\nrunning TV hospital soap. Working with a bunch of no-talent has-been s, playing a stereotyped part and facing the studio's obsession with ratings, he learns to be less of a bull at a gate. He doesn't argue with the\ndirector, he just does the part his way and\nshows that it works. Unfortunately this is\ndisconcerting to the other actors who are\nslaves to the auto cue and are disconcerted by\nthis ad-lib approach. This success on the\nscreen leads to great problems in his personal\nlife. He has to lead a double life as Michael\nDorsey the unemployed serious actor and\nDorothy Michaels the rising soap star. He falls\nin love with fellow soap star Julie (Jessica\nLange) but can't reveal his true identity (or\neven sex).\nJulia thinks s/ he's a lesbian, his old girlfriend\nSandy think he's being unfaithful, his flat mate thinks he's gay, Julia's father wants to marry\nhim and his agent is understandably worried.\n.So thus far we have a fairly predictable\nsitcom. Where this film scores is the\nundertone of feminism. Forced to view the\nworld from a woman's point of view, he fights\nagainst chauvinism and men's patronising\nattitude through the medium of Dorothy. The\nstrength and clarity of her message not only\nproduces a huge fan following but also changes\nthe attitude of the other female actors in the\n'soap'.

It is a great credit\nto his ability that he is a highly believable\nwoman and he puts across the woman's point\nof view with strength and conviction. Jessica\nLange picked up the gong for best supporting\nactress as Julie, and it has to be said it was a good performance, although not outstanding.\nHer characters are always vague, detached,\nmixed up people, merely as though she's playing herself.\n1 suppose you can't have a serious comedy,\nbut you can use it as a; medium and have a good laugh, rather reminiscent of the\napproach taken in the hit stage show\nAccidental Death of an Anarchist.

All jolly scenic and nice,\neveryone is too good to be true and a tragic if\nsomewhat predictable twist forces choices to\nbe made. Good acting all round, but generally\na bit banal. Aimed at a whole new market of\ndivorced fathers, this could be the first of a whole new man-sized Kleenex genre.\nMichael Winner, never one to let subtlety\nbother him, gathers together a highly talented\ncast which he then proceeds to waste on silly,\nbut possibly highly commercial, rubbish.\nWicked Lady, cert 18, playing at the\nLeicester Square Theatre is 1 suppose what\nthey call escapist drama.\nLots of what we've come to\nexpect from Mr Winner as Denholm Elliott,\nPrunella Scales, Faye Dunaway, Alan Bates\nand John Gielgud mess around with leather\nwhips and sil miar silly goings on.

    "content": "Southside Security\nIn an Editorial early last term\nvarious issues concerning security in Southside were raised. It\nwas pointed out that locking the\nmain doors at 7:00pm achieves\nlittle, yet annoys the residents,\nand may even make access easier\nfor intruders, since many stu-dents, mindful of the inconvenience caused, Jam the doors\nopen or allow strangers into the\nbuilding.\nThe correct way in, of course,\nis to use the internal telephone\nsystem and call your host to the\ndoor, but anyone who tries this,\nhaving sought out the night\nporters tucked away inside the\nso-called 'main entrance' and\nattracted their attention through\nthe locked glass door, will only\nbe allowed to use the phone\ngrudgingly, if at all, and made to\nfeel most unwelcome for disrupting a relaxing evening in\nfront of the television.\nShortly after the Editorial\nappeared Jon Barnett, the Union\nWelfare Officer, and Stephen\nGoulder, the President, presented College with a paper on\nsecurity to be discussed at House\nCommittee. This paper contained several sensible and\nworkable ideas to improve the\nsituation, yet despite this (cynics\nmight say because of this) it has\nreceived negligible response\nfrom College.\nSince Jon & Steve's proposals\nare not particularly well known\nby the student body, it may be as\nwell to outline some of them\nhere.\nAt the Selkirk/Keogh entrance to Southside there are two\npairs of doors arranged in series.\niii iii iiii i.'_'_i_i~ i~i~i~ ri~i~i~i~ i~i \u00bb \u00bb \u2022 < \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022'\nWHATEVER YOUR opinions\nof Oxford University, a circular\nsent to me by the Oxford\nUniversity Magazine ISIS will\ndo little to( improve them.\nISIS, I am told, is planning a survey comparing the sex lives of\nstudents at various universities\nand has asked me for a rough\nguide to sexual mores at IC\n(a layman's guide?). From the\nquestions which followed one\ncould well believe that ISIS is\nabout to publish a league table\non the easiest universities to get\nlaid at; should the editors be\nreading this, I'm sorry we didn't reply, but put IC at the bottom\nof the list, theological colleges\nnot excepted.\nThe questionnaire starts out\nwith a series of detailed questions such as 'How many abstain\nfrom sex on religious or moral\nEDITORIAL\nSummertime, and the living is easy...according to Porgy and\nBess anyway, but they never had exams to put up with. For\nthe rest of us, long summer evenings and warm weather bring\nthe time of year when a young man's thoughts turn to hard\nwork, and consequently there are far fewer staff keen to\ndevote their every spare minute to working on FELIX.\nThe moral is that for those of you who don't have exams, or\nwho have exams very early in the term, or who don't want to\ntake exams particularly seriously, if you have ever\nconsidered helping on FELIX, now is the time to volunteer.\nMore than ever this term we shall be needing photographers,\nreviewers, writers, paste-uppers...in fact, however great or\nsmall your ability, we can use you. Look in at the FELIX\nOffice at any time, but especially on Thursday evenings\nwhen, in return for an hour's unskilled labour collating, I have\nbeen known to buy a round of drinks.\nFor those of you who don't volunteer, help, or contribute in\nany way this term, don't complain if FELIX gets rather\nthinner than you're used to.\nAt present the main lock is on\nthe outer pair of doors. The\nUnion has proposed that these\ndoors should have the main lock\nmoved to the inner doors and a Southside-network telephone\nfitted in the entrance lobby\nbetween the doors where visitors\ncould use it at any time. The\nmessengers' desk at the main\nentrance should be closed and\ntransferred to the existing (but\nunused) messengers' desk just\ninside the Selkirk/Keogh doors\nThis would enable those doors to\nbe left open until midnight, or\nwhenever the security guards\nbegin their rounds; at other\ntimes entrance would be by key\nonly.\nThe internal doors connecting\nSelkirk to Tizard should be\nunlocked at all times.\nThe Falmouth/Tizard doors\ninto Southside should be permanently on key access, while\nthe so-called main entrance\nshould be locked when the\nrefectory closes at 7:00pm. The advantages of these\nproposals are so obvious that\none wonders how the current\nsystem ever came into existance.\nIs there any reason for locking\nthe door from Selkirk to Tizard?\nWhy are two security guards\nemployed to a protect a securely\nlocked entrance while fifty yards\naway anyone can get in by\nfollowing one of the residents?\nA change in the system has been\nnecessary for some time now,\nand the proposals Jon and\nStephen have put forward will be\nwelcomed by anyone who has\never faced the frustration of\ngetting into Southside. The\nquestion which must now be\nasked is why has College done so\nlittle in response. Will it take\nanother rape before someone\ntakes any notice of the Union's suggestions?\nCopy Deadline\nCopy deadline is still 5:30pm on\nMonday, and because there are\nfewer staff in the summer it will\nbe even more rigid than before.\nSince this coming Monday is a Bank Holiday, though, the\ndeadline this week will be split:\nfor the Summer Term Calendar\n(which will be in next week's FELIX) the deadline is 3:30pm today; for all other contributions\nit is 10:00am on Tuesday.\nParking Permits\nIf anyone has a Union parking\npermit which they don't use,\nwould they return it to Andy\nGrimshaw, please.\nParties\nBecause of the disturbance\ncaused during the exam term to\nstudents living in Beit, John\nMcCallion has decided not to\nallow any parties in the Union\nBuilding this term.\nImpossible Without...\nany of the usual bunch.

'What percentage\nof boyfriends/girlfriends are\nthere within college?' which\nassume my knowledge of IC\nstudents' sexual habits is as\nwide-ranging as it is detailed.\nThe questions then begin to\ndegenerate not only in pre sump tion, but also in accuracy of\nwording. One rather quaintly\nasks 'Are there any College\nsleeping rules?' to which one is\ntempted to reply that it is left to\nindividuals to decide how much\nsleep they get. Another puts the\nbald question 'Number of\npartners?'\ns<^~\\ iii it i it i it iiii iii iii iii iii iii iii iii iii iii it iii ii it i14 iT \u2022 \u2022 II \u2022\"\n1 1 1 1 1 ! 1 1 1 1 1 1 L11111111I III \u2022 \u2022 t \u2022T \"\u2022 i111 \u2022 t \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 fI Iii iII \u2014\niii< ii \u2022 r \u2022 i*^l^i1 IIII1 I11111111111(1111111111t11 iiii iiii iii And if you were wondering\nwhether\"Jhis question was meant\nto be taken personally, the last\nquestion on the list leaves no\ndoubt on this matter, yet still\nmanages to be at the same time\nimpertinently inquisitive, im-mature, and astonishingly vague\nas to what they really mean.

    "content": "CCHI\nIn January this year, Dr Pretzel of the maths\ndepartment sent me an innocuous looking\npuzzle which falls into two sections: a fairly\neasy first part, and a second part (in the\nFootnotes section), to which the answer is still\nfairly uncertain. To this week's prize puzzle\nfirst:\nParr the First\nYou are sitting fishing in the middle of a round\npond, when suddenly you see the gamekeeper\nat the edge of the pond. He can run four times\n-as fast as you can row or swim; can you give a strategy that will enable you to escape?\n(You can assume that you can have infinite\nacceleration for changing direction etc, and\nassume that neither party will get tired).\nSolutions, comments, criticisms to me at\nthe FELIX Office by Wednesday, 1:00pm. \u00a35\nfrom Mend-a Bike for a randomly selected\nentry.\nLast Term's Solutions\nRehearsal Requirement\nTwo correct solutions were received; the\nwinning entry was from Paul Fisher and\nRichard Glover. Mech Eng postgraduates, and\na cheque for \u00a35 is waiting in the FELIX Office\nin Paul Fisher's name, and can be collected by\nhim any time after Tuesday 1:30pm. The reasoning is as follows: you are given\nfive equations, at least one of which you are\ntold is untrue, and a series of in equations. By\nassuming that the tenor makes two state-ment s, ie that two of the equations are false,\nany three of the remaining equations will\nsupply an infinite set of solutions for the four\nvariables. But the puzzle states that it is\npossible from the given information to find a solution; hence you need four equations to\nsolve four unknowns, irrespective of the\ninequalities given. Thus the Tenor only makes\none statement.\nThe only solution then is that the statement\nfour is the lie and that the alto has made the\nfifth statement. This gives the solution\nSopranos 15, Basses 13, Altos 12, Tenors 5.\nwhich satisfies the in equation. It's an III Wind\nUnder the quite reasonable assumption that\nthere is a one-to-one mapping of keys, then the\nunique solution is that the keys are relabelled:\nKey Relabelled\n1 2\n2\n7\n8\ng0+36+7198I shall admit that I don't know if the\nsolution is unique if bijection is not\nassumed, but thanks Perola for a fascinating\npuzzle.\nJudith Glading of Civ Eng 1 was selected as\nthe winner and can collect her \u00a35 from the\nFELIX Office after 1:30pm on Tuesday.\nDots'n 'Boxes\nCongratulations to CN Goh, an Elec Eng PG,\nwho was randomly selected from the five\ncorrect entries and can collect his \u00a35 cheque\nas per above.\nThe solution is found thus:\nThere are 400 dots, 324 in the middle, 72 on\nthe edge, 4 at corners, and 760 segments.\nGiven that there are 219 red dots, there are\ntherefore 181 green dots.\nNumber of segments attached to red dots is\n(180 x4)+(39x3)+(0x2)=837 And for green:\n(144 x4)+(33x3)+(4x2)=683 The 237 black segments are attached to red\nand green. Therefore of the 837 segments\nattached to red dots, 237 are black. Therefore\n600 arc red, and similarly, of the 683 segments\nattached to green dots, 446 are green.\nEach green segment is shared between two\ngreen dots.\nTherefore there are 223 green segments.\nThanks to John Flanagan (Chem PG) for\nthe above proof.\nBaby, it's code outside\nHad you counted the number of letters,you\nwould no doubt have noticed that there were\n225\u2014a square number, which should have\ngiven away that the letters were to be arranged\nin a15 x15 square to give:\nInviting and inciting me to rise.\nAnd through the window in the wall\nCome streaming in on sunlight wings\nA million bright ambassadors of morning.\nAnd no-one sings me lullabies,\nAnd no-one makes me close my eyes,\nSo I throw the windows wide.\nAnd call to you across the sky.\nPink Floyd\nwhich comes from 'Echoes' from the LP\n'Meddle', by Pink Floyd.\nFruit Shop\nWell, I don't know how many of you looked\nat this one, but a simple solution is for the men\nto sell their oranges at lp a dozen, and 3p for\nsingle oranges.\nPart the Second\nQuite simply, what is your optimum strategy\n(the one which puts the maximum distance\nbetween yourself and the gamekeeper when\nyou reach the edge), and what is the greatest\nratio of speed of gamekeeper to your own\nspeed before you cannot escape?\nThere are two uncollected prizes of \u00a35\nawaiting collection in the FELIX Office by\nRobert Macrae of Elec Eng 1 and James\nAldridge of Physics 2.\n<L*j rW^ Gastropod goes on holiday\nGastropod's Easter jaunt comprised a boat\ntrip up the Thames from Hampton Court to\nOxford. This is a recipe for a superbly\ninexpensive holiday costing as little as \u00a335\neach for a week. Boats are available with two\nto nine berths although for comfort it is best to\nhave a boat with more berths than you need.\nThe boats are fully equipped with kitchen,\nshower and toilet facilities and surprisingly\ncomfortable.\nThe journey to Oxford affords varied and\npicturesque scenery for those who are inclined\ntowards that sort of thing and frequent\nopportunities to moor up at riverside pubs for\nthose who aren't. Any pre-conceptions of tranquillity verging\non boredom are soon dispelled by the need to\nnegotiate numerous locks and assorted\nrip arian hazards such as running around and\nfalling overboard.\nA further attraction is the variety of eating\nplaces along the river. Of those sampled the\nfollowing are the most noteworthy:\nBluebeckers, Church Square, Shepperton\n\u2014 Walton-on-Thames 43377\nThis pleasant and popular burger house is set\nin the old part of Shepperton, close to the\nriver. Although prices are similar to the\nLondon equivalent, portions are bigger and the\nexperience of eating there is enhanced by its\nvillage setting. A standard range of burger\nhouse fare is on offer and the puddings are\nparticularly good. Shepperton is well within the\nrange of IC for a Saturday afternoon outing\nand worth a visit.\nLoad of Bull, 6 Clarence Street, Staines\nStaines 53252\nNot as the name suggests but a burger house\nwith a difference which revolves mainly around\nthe concept of the monster burger.

    "content": "Examinations,\nAnxiety\nAnd Commonsense\nby Don Adlington:\nStudent Counsellor\nWritten, formal examinations\nhave a hallowed place in academic life, and while, from time\nto time, education a lists have\nespoused alternative methods,\nthey are widely accepted as the\nfairest and most efficient means\nof assessing students' knowledge\nand understanding.\nThe written examination is\nnot however by any means a precise instrument. It is certainly\npossible, for example, on individual papers, to come up with a 'fluke' result, that is a result\nmarkedly better than the stu-dent's actual ability would have\nled one to expect. It is also\nunquestionably possible to come\nup with results that are worse\nthan either the student or his\nteachers anticipated, and which\ndo not fairly reflect the student's ability.\nThe risk of systematically\nunder performing in a set of\nexaminations is linked to two\nseparate, but closely related,\nfactors: (a) an inadequate\ntechnique for playing the examination game, and (b) an inadequate recognition that a formal\nexamination, like any other\ntesting situation, can generate\nlevels of anxiety which in\nthemselves may have an adverse\neffect on intellectual functioning.\nPlaying the examination game\nExaminations are to some extent\nan abstraction from reality, an\nartificial construct. They are a sort of game in which the\nparticipants are invited to\ndemonstrate what they know, in\nwriting, on a blank piece of\npaper, in a set time. An important component of the game is\nthat the examiners is forbidden\nto give credit on any other\nevidence than that presented in\nthe script. It is astonishing\nfact that despite this elementary\npoint, some students insist on\nabandoning common sense to\nthe extent, apparently of playing\nFELIX HB HH HH another game altogether. A common manifestation of this is\nthe student who spends an hour\nand three quarters (out of three\nhours) writing, re-writing,\npolishing and perfecting one\nanswer out of four or five\nrequired.\nAnother common departure\nfrom the rules consists in writing\nout the answers without properly\nreading the questions. There are\ntwo, equally devastating variants\nto this: (a) not selecting the\nquestions which opt i mise the\ncandidate's chances of scoring\nhigh over-all, and (b) misreading\nindividual questions and subsequently writing an answer to a question which in effect is not\nthere.\nthe end for finishing off. Some\npeople find that it helps to make\nquick notes on each question at\nthis stage.\n3. Be disciplined in adhering\nto the timetable. Recognise that\nthe first few marks accruing to a question can be obtained far\nmore easily than the last few\u2014\nand it is the total mark which\ncounts. If you get stuck in the\nmiddle of a question leave it and\ndeal with the next one. You can\nalways return to the unfinished\nanswer later, and indeed the\nvery act of disengaging from the\ndifficulty may allow are sol tui on to surface while your mind is\nactually focussed on something\nelse.\n4. Answer the easiest question\nfirst, so that you can proceed to\nthe others on a psychological\n'high'.\n5. Don't be afraid to make\nrough notes in your answer\nbook. When you are answering\none question, ideas relating to\nother questions you are going to\nanswer may come into your\nhead\u2014jot them down. Similarly\non entering the examination\nroom, and possibly before\nreading the paper at all, you may\nwish to write down very quickly\nsalient points which you have\nmemorised in your final pre par ation.\nIt is, of course, essential to\nrule out rough work very clearly,\nso that the examiners knows that\nSome basic and well recognised components of a good\nexamination technique are as\nfollows:\n1. Read the question paper\ncarefully, preferably twice. Errors\nof perception are highly correlated with heightened anxiety.\n2. Select the questions you are\ngoing to answer, put them in\norder, and write out a simple\ntimetable, allowing the same\ntime to all questions (assuming\nthe same maximum marks for\neach). Allow fifteen minutes for\nthe planning and five minutes at\nOH H HM HB HH Hi April 29,1983\nit does not form part of your\nanswer.\n6. If you run out of time, tell\nthe examiner so, and say which\npoints you would have gone on\nto discuss if you had more time.\nDealing with anxiety\nA degree of anxiety, accompanied by recognised physiological symptoms, is a normal\nreaction to testing and stressful\nsituations. Everyone is affected\nto some extent and should be\naware of it. You tell yourself that\nyou are anxious, that it is\nnatural, and that you can handle\nit. In doing that, you minimise\nthe risk that the anxiety may\nescalate to a point where it\nbecomes disabling. Again there\nseem to be some common sense\nways of handling this problem.\nArrive early\u2014far better be\nbiting your nails outside the\nexamination room, than sitting\nin a traffic jam at Earl's Court.\nOnce you are in the examination\nroom, sit down and relax a minute or two before doing\nanything.\nTo a certain extent anxiety is\ncontagious. If you feel that this\nis a hazard for you, then 'keep\nyourself to yourself before\nadmission to the examination\nroom. It may also be worthwhile\nresisting the impulse to compare\nnotes with all your friends\nimmediately after an exam.\nIt is also a good idea in the\nexamination itself, not to let\nyourself be thrown if your\nneighbours appear to be writing\nwith more facility than you are.\nThey may, for all you know, be\nwriting rubbish, and in any case,\ninordinately long answers do not\nnecessarily bring the best results.\nThe most common symptoms\nof anxiety getting out of hand, is\nan overwhelming sense of panic,\na temporary breakdown of\nour rational and ordered response to a demanding situation.\nIn an examination this may, for\nexample, take the form of\n'blanking out' \u2014 completely\nforgetting everything. The\nremedy for this is to switch off,\nclose your eyes, and do nothing\nfor a while.\nThis is far better than yielding\ntoo easily to the powerful\nimpulse to resolve the tension by\ngiving up altogether. When you\nfeel that the anxiety attack has\nabated, try getting your mind\nworking again by using a 'scribble technique'. Just write\ndown words \u2014any words \u2014\nwhich lead to other words, until\nyou feel that your faculty of\nrecall is available to you again.\nA final point. If you have a history of becoming particularly\nanxious at exam times, or if for\ncontingent reasons you think\nthat you may do so this time, it\nwould be sensible to talk to\nsomeone about it well before-hand. Tell you personal tutor or\nyour senior tutor, talk to a doctor or nurse at the Health\nCentre, or come to see me. Just a small amount of practical help\nmay make a substantial difference in the event.\nSome material in this article\nis derived from a lecture given by\nDr Robert Sharp of the Institute\nof Behavioural Therapy.\nI Page9\n\n"

    "content": "WALKABOUTLOOKSCC\nby Mobile Optics Inc.\nIn 1836, a committee of the House of\nCommons was set up to investigate the\npromotion of art in Britain. They reported that\nthe arts received little encouragement in this\ncountry (...so what's new?) and made two\nmajor recommendations to improve the\nsituation. Firstly, schools of design should be\nestablished: the School of Design, later the\nRoyal College of Art, opened the next year.\nSecondly, museums should be set up\nthroughout the country with collections\nincluding, as well as ancient art, 'the most\napproved specimens, foreign as well as\ndomestic, which our extensive commerce\nwould readily convey to us from the most\ndistant quarters of the globe.'\nIn 1852, Henry Cole set up the Museum of\nOrnamental Art: his original collection\nconsisted of examples of decorative art\nunearthed from the cellars of the RCA and\n\u00a35,000 worth of purchases from the Great\nExhibition of 1851. This was the embryonic\nVictoria and Albert Museum.\nConversion from Science to Art\nRight at the end of last term the first expansion\nof the V&A since 1909, the Henry Cole wing,\nopened on Exhbition Road.\nThe new wing is Imperial College's Old\nHuxley Building which once housed, amongst\nother old curiosities, the Department ol\nMeteorology, which was swallowed up into the\nphysics department during the move to the\nNew Huxley Building on Queen's Gate.\nThe new wing contains the Department of\nPrints. Drawings and Photographs, and\nPaintings. It has a specialist bookshop on level\none and a machine dispensing peculiarly nasty\ncoffee on level six. The galleries are spread\nover the intervening floors and linked by the\ndramatic Great North Staircase.\nThe finest gallery, on level six, is that of the\nConstable Collection. Constable's buxom\nclouds float above a soft-pile carpet and the\nview from the windows is across the rooftops\nof South Kensington, towards Constable-style\nclouds over Croydon.\nOn level four, the 1824 Panorama of Rome\nby Caracciolo is on display for the first time. It\nis 44ft long and displayed, as far as possible, as\nit would have been at the time, with steps\nleading up to a circular viewing platform: if you\nlook very carefully you'll find the join!\nTemporary Exhibition Hall\nOn level two, in the high ceiling ed Henry Cole\nGallery, is the exhibition 'Pattern and Design\n1480-1980'. The groups of exhibits show how\nfs and drawings act as inspiration or as\n-nina ry patterns in the creation of\nRampant Ramblings\nMonday Morning Fever\nTo the uninitiated this may conjure up images\nof your familiar lecture theatre with flashing\ncoloured lights in the floor and your balding\nlecturer in gold lame trousers and a white\njacket, doing his best to avoid a stroke to the\nwail of the Bee Gees.\nBut the rest of us know better. A more\nappropriate analogy is perhaps big black gorilla\ndisease. Somewhat akin to green monkey\ndisease, but bigger and uglier; it usually occurs\nafter one has been carousing till after the first\nof the 'morrow, as the saying has it.\nWhen you're safely tucked in bed, a large\nblack ape comes in, beats you about the head\nand puts all manner of foul substances in your\nmouth, and then departs without anyone being\nthe wiser.\nShortly afterwards, Monday morning arrives\nlike Apocalypse Now only closer to your left\near.\nThe way in which fate connives with alarm\nclock manufacturers to produce clocks which\nmake it not only impossible to find the off\nbutton without full consciousness, but also\nelude the desperate lunge of a roused but\nuncomprehending assailant, will remain one of\nthe gross injustices of this world. Those people\nwho do manage to cope with those radio-alarm-cassette player-fridge freezers first thing\nin the morning have my eternal admiration.\nHaving managed to put my pullover on\nninety degrees out of phase, wash in the\ncornflakes bowl, eat my breakfast out of the\nsink and get toothpaste up my nose it must be\ntime to be late for the first lecture.\nSo next time someone arrives ten minutes\nlate on Monday morning looking like\nsomething that's been cleared off the set after\nshooting Alien you'll know. Or maybe you're\nten minutes late?\nRhyno\nornamental 3D objects, be they candlesticks,\ntables or silk petticoats.\nIn one group the focal point is William\nMorris's1874 'Willow' design for wallpaper.\nOne of his sources may well have been the\nplant imagery of John Gerard's17 th century\n'Herball', which is displayed open at the\nillustration of 'The Ozier or Water Willow'.\nThe intricate willow design itself became\nsource material for a printed cotton produced\nby Morris & Co twenty years later. Recently a wallpaper, produced by Osborne & Little Ltd\nfor Liberty & Co in 1975, was adapted from\nthe printed cotton fabric. The delicacy of the\nfoliage is preserved from design to design, but\nthe spontaneous naturalism of the original has\ndeveloped, through successive mutations, into\na stylized intertwining of leafy shapes.\nThe catalogue for this exhibition deserves\nthe book self rather than the coffee table.\nIts illustrations, both B& W and colour, provide\nan attractive (as well as informative) record of\nthe links between designs and finished\nartifacts. And for the enthusiast, or specialist,\nthere's an index to the huge collection of\ndesigners' drawings in the V&A. Where? Wheren? \u00a3?\n'Pattern and Design: Design for the decorative\narts 1480-1980' is the main exhibition area of\nthe Henry Cole Gallery. It's on until July 3 and\nis free. The exhibition and the new wing are\nopen, like the rest of the V&A, weekdays and\nSaturday 10:00-17:50. Sunday 14:30-17:50,\nclosed Fridays.\nPage 81 April 29,1983 FELIX\n\n"
