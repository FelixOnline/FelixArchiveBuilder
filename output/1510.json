    "content": "It is very difficult to retain a historical perspective of the present. Artistic movements only acquire recognition and an associated nomenclature once they are well established, or in many\ncases once they have peaked. However, I am going to stick my neck out to predict that art histories yet to be written will refer to \u2018Sciencism\u2019 or\n\u2018Technophilism\u2019originating in our time. Perhaps\nsome other silly name will be used, but I stand\nby my hunch. A term will be required to collect\nthe current dearth of art/science collaborations.\nArt has always drawn inspiration from scientific advance and vice versa. One could point to\nthe Renaissance or Futurism in the early 20th\nCentury as a precedent but at no time in history\nhas this truly cross-disciplinary conduit been\nmore alive with crackling, electric energy.\nWe currently live in a society saturated with\ntechnology to an extent never seen before. The\nfruits of nanotechnology, genetic engineering,\nand quantum physics are no longer confined to\nthe space program and international research es-tablishments. These developments are present in\nour pockets, on our plates and in our hospitals.\nFELIX\nFriday 10 february 2012\n22\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nArts Editors: Will Prince\nEva Rosenthal\nARTS\nThe Poets are on holiday:\nFusion\nWhat do Lady Gaga, Made in Chelsea, and Chicago\nhave in common? A high level of entertainment.\nSex Appeal. Great hair. And Fusion@London.\nYou\u2019ve probably heard of Fusion@London. But\nyou might be wondering what it is and why you\nshould care. Fusion brings together music, dance,\nand fashion. All four headliners are ones to watch\nin 2012. Clement Marfo & The FrontLine (rap\nmeets rock meets dubstep), Angel (R&B\u2019s best\nkept secret), Charli XCX (80\u2019s pop, but better), and\nSunday Girl (synth-pop, but melancholic) have all\nbeen featured on MTV\u2019s Brand New Artists.\nOn the fashion front, the designers are just as\ncool as the headliners \u2013 Central St. Martin\u2019s graduate Ara Jo has dressed the likes of Lady Gaga\nand Jamelia; designs by LCF\u2019s Jenny Morris can be\nseen gracing the shoulders of Girls Aloud star Nicola Roberts; and Viven of Holloway\u2019s fifties style\ndresses can be spotted all over the red carpet. Fusion can boast even bigger street cred with names\nlike Jaeger and Hugo Boss \u2013 also providing looks.\nSo who has put this all together? Well, the committee and cast are drawn from all over London.\nThat hot girl in your engineering lecture? She\u2019s\nprobably modelling lingerie.

And it\u2019s no\nbake sale (those rock though). It\u2019s twelve months\nof hard work. Money invested on lights, music,\nchoreography, costumes, and venues (plus all the\nstuff they got for free).

For those\nwho missed it, we had seven exhibits, each with\ntheir own imaginative take on the theme. These\npieces included ceramics, glassware and book-bindings on themes as diverse as viral evolution,\nenvironmentalism and MRI tomography. I observed a real curiosity on the part of the artists\nto understand the work of the various scientists\ninvolved but more importantly an eagerness to\nexpress a meaningful response.\nThis meaningfulness is important. It is not\nenough for art to simply draw on the imagery\nof science nor to simply exploit new methods of\nproducing work. Art is important because it can\nreact and respond in a considered yet emotive\nway to its influences. If science reflects society\u2019s\nrational, analytical aspect, then art is the exhibition of its spiritual and sensitive side. As anyone\nwho has ever been a human will testify, an individual will suffer if these two elements are not in\nphase. The same is true for a culture. Welcome\nto the world Sciencism.

An age best\ndescribed as scientifically enlightened but socially and politically backwards world. One sees\nevidence of this slow shift everywhere. Rambert\nDance School now has a scientist in residence\nand Imperial College Physics Department has an\nartist in residence. David Hockney paints with\nan iPad and our own Computing Department\nprograms computers to paint. There are now galleries and arts fairs in London entirely dedicated\nto technological new media art. I could, as you\nmight guess, list examples of projects and artists\nworking in this arena for pages, but I will refrain.\nThe truly exciting thing is that this movement\nis happening now, today, in this city. What is\nmore, you have a chance to contribute. It was my\nown interest and enthusiasm for art/science collaborations which lead me to chair Artifact last\nyear. For those of you who have not heard of the\nproject, the basic premise was to pair scientists\nfrom Imperial College with artists and designers from the Royal College of Art. We sought\nto provide a central forum where people could\nexchange ideas and inspire each other\u2019s work,\nvery different from the ad-hoc collaborations I\nhad seen to date. The enthusiasm was palpable.\nAlmost two hundred people signed up for our\ninitial speed-dating just under a year ago. There\nwere talks from speakers and lots of ideas buzzing around during an extremely fun and lively\nevening.\nSo, after the hangovers had dissipated, what\nactually materialised from the hours of talking\nand the brainstorming? Quite a lot, rather to my\n\u201cWelcome to the world,\nSciencism.

    "content": "any way from the science itself?\nCC: Personally, I think that if you\u2019re\nwriting a science story in a newspaper\nlike the FT for example, for an intelligent but generally non-scientific read-ership, you should be able to include\nsome details which will not be understood by everyone, and will be under-stood, and illuminate the piece, say, for\nscientists. It shouldn\u2019t put off non-sci-entists. In other words, the piece should\nbe comprehensible to any intelligent\nreader, but that does not mean that any\nintelligent reader should be able to understand every detail in the piece. You\u2019d\nnever get anywhere if you had to spell\nout all the details. I am a great believer\nin pieces that can be read by everyone,\nbut will not be so over-simplified for\nthe scientist.\nFB: What of the different vocabularies used? The scientific training\nprovides a very different working\nvocabulary \u2013 for example those cases\nin which journalists ask astronomers\nwhether there is a chance of a meteorite hitting the Earth, and the scientist would say, \u201cWell there is a 99%\nchance that it won\u2019t hit the earth,\nbut...\u201d and immediately the journalist asks, \u201cBut is there a chance?\u201d\n\u2013 \u201cWell, I can\u2019t assure it won\u2019t happen...\u201d. Obviously, when that word\nis said in a scientific context it would\ndenote that the chances are it will\nnever happen. But said in a general\ncontext, without the implied scientific\ncaution, it may give the impression\nto the general public that there is a\nfair chance of a meteorite hitting the\nEarth.\nCC: I agree there is a different vocabu-lary, not just in terms of technical terms,\nbut even just the way everyday words\nare used, which journalists sometimes\ndon\u2019t get. I\u2019ve learnt to interpret this for\nthe public in a way that will not embarrass the scientists. But some scientists\ndo take it too much to extreme, like\nquantum physicists, who will say \u201cthere\nis a chance that this chair will levitate\nitself\u201d. They say that, but in fact there\u2019s\nzero chance. I would say it\u2019s impos-sible, but quantum physicists would say\nit\u2019s not impossible. It depends what you\nmean by impossible.\nFB: Related to that it seems, especially in the US media, that there\u2019s a\ntendency amongst the public to consider expert opinions merely as opinions and so, for example the educated\nopinions of climate scientists about\nglobal warming is sometimes put\non the same level as general opinion\nleaders with no particular expertise\n\u2013 is this a problem when it comes to\nscience journalism? Is it right that\nnon-experts be given equal platform\nto experts?\nCC: No, it\u2019s very wrong, and certainly\nat the FT the policy of our editor \u2013 all\nFT editors in my memory \u2013 has been\nthat if it\u2019s a science-based issue, the\nvoice of scientists is paramount. If the\nvast majority of scientists are saying\none thing, well, you should reflect that\nopinion, even if there\u2019s a small number\nof scientists saying something different.\nObviously on climate change there are\nsome scientists, even a few who know\nquite a lot about climatology, who challenge the orthodoxy. But when the vast\nmajority of scientists say one thing, we\nfollow them. Likewise on the safety of\ngenetically modified foods and other is-sues.\nFB: The BBC tends to take a different\nopinion, in that it will try and present\nall views \u2013 to not really side with any-one. And there are these Newsnight\nstyle panel debates where you\u2019ll have\nthe creationist sitting opposite the expert in evolution. Do you think that\u2019s\ndamaging to the scientific message,\nhaving these very polarised debates?\nCC: Yes, I think it is damaging. For ex-ample, on the issue of climate change,\nclimate sceptics regard the BBC as\nbeing very much against them, very\nmuch the voice of scientific ortho-doxy. Whereas from the point of view\nof most scientists, the BBC gives too\nmuch weight to the skeptics. The BBC\nis particularly exposed, and on this\nsort of debate it just can\u2019t win. I rather\nsympathise with them on this. Yes, they\ngive probably too much voice to very\nminority views, but in their position\nthey have to really.\nFB: Do you think the social media\nand the blogosphere are, in part,\nresponsible for the laudation of non-expert opinions? Are they affecting\nscience journalism?\nCC: I think they are affecting science\njournalism, but I think things are getting better. When blogs were quite new,\na lot of weird stuff was going out there.\nNow that it\u2019s so easy, there are more\nscientists in the blogosphere, so there\u2019s\nmore of a weight of sensible scientific\nviews than there used to be. I think that\nbalance is tilting back towards science.\nThere\u2019s just so much there! So many\nscientists are taking part I think things\nhave got better.\nFB: Most of the science journalism\nnews are reports about scientific dis-coveries. I wonder if you\u2019d agree that\nengineering as a discipline doesn\u2019t\nget that much of a covering in gen-eral?\nCC: Yes I agree.\nFB: For example a mobile phone\nis something that people take for\ngranted, but when you actually study\nwhat\u2019s inside them, you find something preposterously complicated\nand sophisticated. It seems that that\npeople do not get to appreciate, in\nthe same way as with science in gen-eral, how much work and how many\nbreakthrough discoveries are involved engineering as a field.\nCC: What you have said is very true.\nI would say there are two field which\nare under-reported: engineering\u2019s probably the biggest one, but also the whole\nof chemistry is very under-reported.\nIt\u2019s difficult to know how to report either of those. I do try. But it\u2019s difficult\ncompared to discoveries in biomedical\nresearch or even physics, where there\u2019s\nmore of a sort of gee-whiz factor, a\nwow factor \u2013 particles going faster than\nthe speed of light, or some new step towards curing cancer. Yes it is a fault in\nthe whole system; I think it always has\nbeen probably.\nFB: But, for instance, in the 19th\ncentury writers seemed very excited\nabout new machines that were in-vented. I don\u2019t know whether we\nhave already taken for granted that\ntechnological progress is going to\nkeep happening on an everyday ba-sis, so that now we are not surprised\nby the amazing feats engineering offers continuously.\nCC: Well I think one of the things is\nthat now a lot of the engineering \u2013 the\nbasic engineering breakthroughs \u2013 are\nmade in companies that don\u2019t want to\ntalk about it; whereas in the 19th century it was more open. Mobile phone\ncompanies don\u2019t want to give away secrets really. If you look at the science\nand engineering that\u2019s reported in the\nmedia, the vast majority comes out of\nuniversities and public research labs because they want to talk about it whereas\nthe companies only want to talk about it\nin terms of selling their product, rather\nthan talking about their underlying science and technology. And then also\nwhat engineering needs is a sort of Brian Cox equivalent, who can really win\nover hundreds of thousands, millions of\npeople by popularising it. There isn\u2019t\nanyone like that in engineering as far as\nI know. Or chemistry.\nFB: Each year there\u2019s a Royal College of Science Union \u2018Science Challenge\u2019, which is an essay competition\nfor students here at the college, and\none of the questions this year was set\nby Pallab Ghosh, science correspondent at the BBC. How would you begin to answer his question \u201cWhat is\nthe role of science journalism in the\n21st century?\u201d\nCC: That\u2019s a very good question! I\nsuppose the simple answer to Pallab\u2019s\nquestion is that science journalism is\nthe medium by which scientists communicate with the general public. So\nlooking at it from the scientist\u2019s point of\nview, even with the latest technology,\nvery few scientists can get through to\nvery many people. For most scientists,\nif they want the world to know about\ntheir research \u2013 and more and more of\nthem do \u2013 then science journalists are\nthe best medium, the best means of\ncommunication. And you can look at\nit from the other way around, from the\npoint of view of the general interested\nreader or viewer or listener. Then you\nwould like to find out about what\u2019s going on through science journalism because the average person is not going to\nread Nature or Science or any other primary journal, so you\u2019re going to have to\nuse a secondary or tertiary source. For\nmost people, that\u2019s going to be science\njournalism and the mass media.\nBUSINESS\nFELIX Friday 10 February 2012 17\n\n"

Email\narticles to:\npolitics.felix@\nic.ac.uk\nPOLITICS\nFELIX Friday 10 february 2012 15\nI\nn the wake of last week\u2019s pay\nscandal concerning RBS CEO\nStephen Hester, a lot has been\nsaid in regards to the opulence\nof bankers\u2019 bonuses. In fact, in\nthe private student accommodation in\nwhich I live we even held a debate at\nthe weekend, with a slim majority voting for motion which stated that the\ngovernment should prevent excessive\npay. Since the recession and our slow\neconomic recovery, the public has been\nbaying for blood at the mere mention\nof a large bonus, with heads of public\nbodies afraid of the public backlash of\nreceiving a bonus, no matter how well\ndeserved. Over the last two weeks, the\nChairman and CEO of RBS (83% state\nowned) both declined to take a bonus,\nfollowed by several directors of Network Rail. Now, while these companies\nare both controlled by the state that, as\nmajority shareholder, has the right to\nveto executive pay packages, some people are starting to call for the government to cast its net wider and consider\nbanning bankers\u2019bonuses in the general\nfinancial industry.\nThe general consensus is that the Global\nFinancial Crisis of 2007-8 was caused\nby the financial services industry using risky sub-prime mortgages sold to\na low-income section of society with a\nhigh risk of default. Some believe that\nthe banking bonus culture propagated\nthe system failure, arguing that mortgage sellers aimed to sell large numbers\nof adjustable rate mortgages to customers with a high risk of default because\nthey were more concerned about short-term achievements such as hitting targets\nand getting bigger bonuses than about\nthe long-term risk of their investments.\nA main criticism of bonuses is that they\nencourage the purchase of riskier debt by\nbankers, the pay of whom is only related\nto short-term performance and not the\nlong term performance of the deals they\nmake. This behaviour lumbers the bank\nwith toxic assets, which can turn bad at\nshort notice that, as was seen at the time,\nputs the customers of the bank at risk\nand can lead to bailouts by governments\nworld-wide.\nAnother argument for banning or capping the bonuses of bankers is that\nthey are simply given too much mon-ey. Banking bonuses can range from\ntens of thousands given to graduates\nin their first to the odd million pounds\ngiven to a bank\u2019s top performers and\nexecutive staff. This is in a stark contrast to the median American annual\nsalary of $26,364 in 2011 or a mean\nUK household income of \u00a326,000.\nMany say it is negligent to allow\nbankers and CEOs of top companies\nto be allowed to propagate income\ninequality by being paid many times\nthe amount of an average employee in\ntheir company (or in the case of banks,\nan average person).\nSince banks handle such large sums\nof money and gain astronomical rev-enues, it is fairly accepted that banks\nhave a lot of money available, however\nthey seem to distribute a large amount\nof this to their employees instead of\ngiving some benefit to their customers\nor investing in community programs.\nBanks pays their employees a lot of\nmoney simply because they can, not\nnecessarily because it is deserved.\nPeople do also wonder if the amount\ngiven can be in any way related to the\nextra value an employee has brought to\na company. Certainly there are the odd\nfew stories of hedge fund managers\nhaving being paid 50% of the returns\nmade by their funds in recent years.\nSimilarly for CEOs, do million pound\nbonuses (like the one offered to Stephen Hester) accurately reflect the extra work and results that the payee has\ngiven? Surely they, and other employees are already compensated enough by\n100,000 or million pound base packages for salaries? In fact many people\nbelieve that bonuses given to bankers\nare not performance related at all but\nare in fact an way to give their employees more money, whether earned or not.\nThe aforementioned points are a few\nof the reasons that people have raised\ntheir spears in the direction of bankers\u2019\nbonuses. Why doesn\u2019t the government\ndo something, like tax bankers or even\nban bonuses? Indeed who else can effectively regulate the financial services\nindustry to reduce the kind of risky behaviour that can lead to another financial crash? But what should the government do? There are already some\nregulatory bodies like the Financial\nServices Authority in the UK and Federal Reserve Board of Governors and\nthe Securities Exchange Commission\nin the US, however they are not always\nable to keep abreast of the latest developments in the financial sector and so\nat times they can only offer a knee-jerk\nreaction to negative practices which are\neventually brought to light. Increasing\nthe awareness of such bodies and tightening regulations would be a good start\nto make the financial services industry\nmore transparent. The government also\nhas the option of increasing the rate of\ntax paid by bankers, however this is\nnot so easy in practice. Since they cannot single out employees from a single\nindustry for tax purposes they would\nhave to either increase the top rate of\ntax for high earners, introduce a new\nhigher rate tax band or increase taxes\non financial institutions. There are, of\ncourse, problems associated with each\nof these approaches, the most obvious\nbeing that an increase in tax paid by\nwealthy individuals or companies will\nlead to a \u2018talent drain\u2019 where these individuals will simply move to a different\ncountry where they can enjoy a larger\ndisposable income. Also this may encourage such entities to use tax avoidance or evasion techniques to hide their\nearnings from the state. This can be a\nproblem, especially in countries like the\nUK where the financial services industry is a major part of the economy and\nlarge companies pay around 60% of all\ntaxes received by the government.\nAnother problem we face is determining\nhow involved the government should be\nin the affairs of private sector compa-nies. In the western world the capitalist\nsystem is generally embraced and the\nideal of the free market is roughly adhered to, excusing some interventions\nby the government like competition regulations and the minimum wage. With\nBringing down the Bankers\nJoseph Letts looks at the future of performance-related pay in the City\nBankers like Hester earn over \u00a32m. Meanwhile, print journalism is dying. Nice\nthis system in place it seems impossible\nfor a government like that of the UK to\ncredibly place restraints on the behaviour of companies in the private sector\nyet some still call for the government to\nset a maximum salary or to ban bonuses\naltogether. Taking the UK government\nas an example, with their reluctance to\nemploy a financial tax on banks without\na similar effort being made globally it\nseems unrealistic to believe they would\ntake a more hands on approach. Aside\nfrom the fact that enforcing such measures in the UK would wound our competitiveness internationally it is easy to\nimagine that the unease caused by the\ngovernment micromanagement could\nsend companies running to the arms of\na much friendlier ruling body. Not to\nmention the legality of such actions. In\na democratic country the government\nsimply does not have to right to influence or penalise what they consider bad\nmanagement decisions made by private\ncompanies.\nBut what could the government do in-stead? One suggestion is to give more\npower to shareholders, an idea already\nbeing considered by the Con-Lib coali-tion.

These\npaintings were not created in flashes\nof inspiration, but were the product of\nyears of study in the pursuit of perfec-tion.\nIn fact perfection, and in particular\nidealised beauty, was another theme\nthat ran throughout this particular selection of pieces, and indeed through\nall of da Vinci\u2019s work. In his portrayal\nof women, such as Cecilia (Sforza\u2019s\nARTS\nFELIX Friday 10 FEBRUARY 2012 23\nVeni, Vidi, Vinci\nDeepka Rana and George Howard came to the Leonardo exhibition, had a look\naround then, err, wrote a review, unearthing a few conspiracy theories along the way\nW\ne would never\nclaim to have an\nimpressive bank of\nknowledge of the\narts, however this\ndid not reduce the sheer excitement felt\nwhen, against all odds, we secured a set\nof, now hallowed, tickets to the Leonardo da Vinci exhibition.\nSince November, more than half of\nthe Old Master\u2019s existing paintings\nand a multitude of his drawings have\nbeen hanging within the halls of the\nNational Gallery\u2019s Sainsbury Wing.\nInsured for a breathtaking \u00a31.5bn,\nthe collection was remarkable for its\nunprecedented scale, displaying paintings and drawings never before seen\ntogether. In fact, this was an exhibition of many firsts \u2013 notably, the two\nversions of the \u2018Virgin of the Rocks \u2018\ncould be seen facing each other - and\ncertainly did not disappoint as a once-in-a-lifetime show.\nThe selected works, shown under\nthe title of Painter at the Court of\nMilan chronicled the time Leonardo\nspent in the employment of Ludovico\nSforza, the Duke of Milan, during the\nlate 15th Century. It was this partnership that was responsible for the remarkable metamorphosis of the art of\npainting that took place during his 18-year residency; although Leonardo did\nnot complete a great number paintings\nin his lifetime, this particular period\nwas responsible for some of his most\nrevered work.\nIt was almost reassuring to find that,\neven for a master craftsman like Da\nVinci, the mantra of \u2018practice makes\nperfect\u2019 still holds. Adorning many\nwalls was a wide selection of comparatively small sketches or \u2018studies\u2019,\nmost of which are part of the Royal\nCollection, on loan from Her Majesty the Queen. Leonardo used these\nto practice the many intricate details\nof his paintings before beginning the\nactual piece. The importance of these\nstudies can truly be appreciated as the\nexhibition continues from room to\nroom. Rough sketches such as those\nlong term mistress) in \u2018Lady with an\nErmine\u2019, da Vinci gives the subjects\nsuch perfect features that it was often\nquestionable whether he actually paid\nmuch heed to the sitter\u2019s true form.\nThis idealisation was fuelled in part\nby the belief that outer beauty reflected the virtue within a person. In fact\nthe portrait of Cecilia was deemed so\nbeautiful that it moved Bellincinio, a\ncourt poet, to write a poem about it,\ndisplayed in the exhibition adjacent to\nthe painting itself.\nThis review could not pass without\na mention of the extraordinary agreement with the Louvre that allowed for\nthe remarkable sight of both versions\nof the \u2018Virgin of the Rocks\u2019 hanging\nside by side. This was a juxtaposition\nnever seen during Leonardo\u2019s lifetime,\nor ever since, and is unlikely to be re-peated. Although superficially similar,\nthe subtle intricacies of the two works\nrevealed how Da Vinci\u2019s technique\nand style changed over his time in\nMilan. They also served to emphasise\nthe attention to detail that Leonardo\npoured into each of his works, with\nsome elements so similar that it was\nhard to imagine that they were painted\nindependently of each other. To be\nable to stand in the centre of a room\nwith these two masterpieces on either\nside for comparison was a truly amazing experience.\nThe final \u2018pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance\u2019,\nreached by a short detour into the\nbowels of the main gallery, was most\ndefinitely worth the suspense. Entering the second part of the Da Vinci\nexhibit, and turning the corner, one\nwas greeted by the awe inspiring Last\nSupper, reproduced by one of Leonardo\u2019s students on canvas. Leonardo\u2019s\noriginal, painted on the wall of the\nSanta Maria delle Grazie monastery in\nMilan, has sadly hugely deteriorated\nsince his time, partly due to the experimental materials the artist used to\nseal the wall after painting. However,\ntwo contemporary copies do luckily\nexist which provide a valuable record\nof the original.\nThis scene has been subject to many\na conspiracy theory in its time; ranging\nfrom the presence of a pregnant Mary\nMagdalene to stories of the chalice\nand the Knights Templar. Some have\neven gone to such lengths as to superimpose a mirror image of the painting,\nand \u2018see\u2019 a Templar Knight and a baby\npictured, raising many questions as to\nLeonardo\u2019s true intentions in his portrayal of biblical scenes. Unable to obtain any comment from His Holiness\nthe Pope, the authors can neither deny\nnor confirm such theories\u2026\nUnfortunately, Leonardo at the National Gallery has since finished\n\u201cIdealised beauty\nwas a theme that ran\nthroughout this selection of pieces\u201d\nThe consumer response to the release of the Samsung Galaxy Tab didn\u2019t quite match that of its competitors\n\u201cThis was an exhibition of many firsts \u2013\na once-in-a-lifetime\nshow\u201d\nHe knows\n\n"

Yeah I was at Sunderland Uni, which is not really anything to brag about, but I was only doing Film and Media. But yeah I packed\nin half way through my final year and\nended up doing stand up. I\u2019d done the\nfirst paragraph of my dissertation and I\nwent ah fuck this and just stopped.\nT: Now that your friends know that\nyou\u2019re a stand-up comedian, do you\nfeel pressured to be funny in normal\nconversations?\nC: I\u2019ll tell you what, this is genuinely\ntrue, beware right, because if you end\nup doing a bit of stand up, once you\nare a stand up comic, you are no longer the funniest one in your group of\nmates. It\u2019s fucking weird. It\u2019s really\nbizarre. If you start being really funny\nwith them, everyone just goes: \u201calright\nmate you\u2019re not on stage now\u201d. It\u2019s just\nreally strange, I can\u2019t explain it.\nWith my friends when they\u2019re all\ntaking the mick out of each other and\nhaving a laugh; I always come in far\ntoo strong and ruin it, like I come in\nwith an awful, horrible insult. It\u2019s just\nreally weird \u2013 your barometer totally\nchanges.\nT: Do you think that now that you\u2019re\nknown, when people see you on stage\nthey actively try to heckle as they\nthink: \u201cRight, I\u2019m getting one over\non him\u201d?\nC: They can try. I did Manchester\nComedy Store on Saturday Night, I did\nthe late show and it was just 20 minutes\nof heckles and 20 minutes of me just\nslamming into everyone who opened\ntheir fucking mouth, was good fun.\nT: I\u2019m guessing you\u2019re very\ncalm and aren\u2019t going to be\nfazed.\nC: Yeah essentially, I mean there\nare still heckles that can\nthrow you off, but\nyou get to a point\nman where everything they can\nshout out is the\nsame. There\nare only a few\ndifferent angles you\ncan go\nwith a\nheck-le. No matter what the words are it can\neither be an insult, a funny comment,\na comment on something you\u2019ve done,\nor it can be sarcastic, or it can sometimes be complimentary, which is always weird.\nT: I wouldn\u2019t know how to reply to\nthat. I guess just thank you, okay,\nI\u2019m going to get back to my material\nnow.\nC: Yeah a few times a girl\u2019s shouted\n\u201cyou\u2019re fit\u201d and I\u2019ve been like \u201cthat\nis not relevant at all, shut up, do you\nknow what I mean? First of all, don\u2019t\nheckle compliments cause it just\nthrows us off. I\u2019d rather you called me\na cunt, if you can believe that. It has\ngot no relevance to the performance,\njust shut up.\nT: (laughs) I don\u2019t know, to be hon-est, maybe you should have tried to\nget her number after that?\nC: (laughs) Nah: they\u2019re normally nut-ters. If you\u2019re shouting out \u201cyou\u2019re\nfit\u201d to a boy on stage at a comedy club\nyou\u2019re not normal are you?\nT: I think that\u2019s probably the female\nequivalent of beeping your horn\nwhen you see someone attractive\nwalking across the road.\nC: Exactly, or hanging out of a white\nvan going \u201cget your tits out love\u201d.\nT: Do you have sort of set responses\nto them? As in, if someone says this\nabout my hair I\u2019m going to say this?\nC: Yeah well first of all it will depend\non what they look like. A lovely little\ntrick I like to do, if I\u2019m doing my own\nshow and someone heckles from the\nback, I go: \u201cAlright you\u2019re just heckling there from the back in the darkness\nand I want to see you\u2026 house lights\nup\u201d and then the sound man\nwill put all the fucking\nlights on and they just\nsit there shitting their\npants. They just didn\u2019t\neven think I had the\npower to do that. I love\ngetting house lights on, it\nreally levels the playing\nfield \u2013 it\u2019s great.\nT: Have you ever had\na joke or routine that\nyou\u2019ve said that someone\u2019s either stolen, or\nsomeone\u2019s just thought\nof it independently,\nand you\u2019ve thought:\n\u201cah no I can\u2019t use that\nnow\u201d?\nC: Yeah, I thought of something when\nI was first starting out. I thought of like\n3 heckle putdowns in a row that were\nabout someone\u2019s mum that were this\nfull little routine thing. I did it on stage\nand this guy came up and he went \u2018oh\nerm that\u2019s on Jimmy Carr\u2019s DVD\u201d. I\nwas like ah shit. He said go on YouTube and it was fucking word for word\nwhat I\u2019d written \u2013 I was devastated.\nI\u2019ve never stolen material and I never\nwould steal material. I think it\u2019s just\nthe worst crime in comedy. There are\nsome people who keep doing it as well.\nI know a comic who did a routine and\nyou go \u201csuch and such has been doing\nthat for years\u201d and they go \u201cyeah, well,\nI thought of it, I didn\u2019t copy off them,\nso I\u2019ll keep doing it\u201d and it\u2019s like well\nyou can\u2019t do that.\nIf you started writing a book and\nsomeone said: \u201coh by the way mate,\nCharles Dickens wrote that years ago\nabout Christmas. It\u2019s exactly the same\nas the one you\u2019ve written\u201d and you go\n\u201cwell I thought of it, I\u2019m going to keep\nwriting it\u201d. No-one\u2019s going to fucking\nbuy it are they. David Johnston\u2019s A\nChristmas Carol.\nT: Have you got a writing process?\nDo you sit down at a laptop, or just\nrandomly think of stuff?\nC: No I haven\u2019t got one at all. Some\ncomics can sit down and click away\nbut I can\u2019t do it. If something tickles\nmy fancy, I do it in sort of really short,\nsharp, bursts and then work most of it\nout while I\u2019m on stage. So I just do it\non the fly really. I can\u2019t sit and write a\nfull routine; if I do I just end up not being able to remember it.\nT: A lot of comedians nowadays go\ninto acting. Are you thinking of doing that? Any TV shows you\u2019d like\nto do?\nC: Yeah, there\u2019s one on the horizon ac-tually, but it hasn\u2019t been officially announced yet so I can\u2019t say anything.\nT: Have you ever done any acting or\nis it just you\u2019re a comedian so you\nthought \u201cmeh, might as well give it\na go\u201d?\nC: The particular thing in question,\nthere was a thing in Manchester called\nthe sitcom trial. We had to do a big live\nrun through of the sitcom \u2013 like a play.\nWe did it all in one go in front of a live\naudience and it was mad to do. That\nwas my first proper foray into acting,\nunless you count playing Santa in a\nschool nativity when I was 5.\nT: (laughs) I don\u2019t know, you could\nhave had a starring role then.\nC: Actually, don\u2019t think it was 5, think\nI was 7. It\u2019s not a very big point, but\nthat\u2019s two years of serious maturity of\nmy acting career from 5 to 7.\nT: Those were your Brando years\nwhen you were getting your method\nacting on. Is acting weird compared\nto comedy because you\u2019re saying\nsomeone else\u2019s words?\nC: Yeah, it\u2019s really weird. I\u2019d never\ndone it and I felt like I couldn\u2019t do it.\nThen people are going \u201cno you\u2019re good\nat this\u201d and I just thought they were\nlying. Every time they were saying\nyou\u2019re good at this, I was holding eye\ncontact for a bit too long to see if they\nlooked away.\nT: Do you think the state of comedy\nnowadays is healthy?\nC: For someone at my level and upwards it\u2019s healthy. I think it\u2019s going to\nstart getting harder for new people to\nstart breaking through. I\u2019m lucky that\nI broke through when I did. I hope the\nsmaller clubs don\u2019t suffer, because\nyou\u2019ve just got to look in your local\nculture guide and there\u2019ll be about\nfour fucking comedians there this\nmonth doing shows, which is brilliant,\nbut, what\u2019s that doing to the smaller\nclubs? A lot of people are saying that\nit happened in America: apparently\nthe smaller clubs just died out and all\nthe touring comics took over. I\u2019ve got\nto say I\u2019m glad I\u2019m on tour, but really\nhope that doesn\u2019t happen.\nT: When was your first show? Do you\nremember it?\nC: Yeah it was mad actually. There was\na ferry from Newcastle to Amsterdam.\nI was on it with my mates and there was\nan entertainer, like a comedian, on the\nstage and he was doing alright. It was\na little bit sort of juggly and kind of\nstuff like that bit more family friendly.\nHe had what was either some kind of\nstroke, or a heart attack, and he sort of\nkeeled over. My mate was a medical\nstudent and looked after him for a bit. I\npicked up the mic to put it back in the\nstand and I ended up saying something\nto someone, and just started messing\nabout, and before I knew it I\u2019d done 40\nminutes of this routine, just impromptu\non this boat.

You\ncan use brown or caster sugar for these\ncheesecakes \u2013 personally I prefer using\nsoft dark brown sugar, because you\u2019ll\nget a lovely rich color that visually\ncomplements how indulgent these are.\nIf you opt for caster sugar, you\u2019ll get\na lovely contrast between the very pale\ncheesecake batter and the dark pieces\nof Twix. Taste-wise the difference is so\nmild; so your choice of sugar just boils\ndown to what your visual preferences\nare.\nAlso, if you really want to cut a few\ncorners, use Sainsbury\u2019s own brand\nchocolate toffee biscuit fingers as dupes\nfor Twix.\nCrust:\n\u2013 20 Oreos (a typical 154g package\ncontains about 14)\n\u2013 50g unsalted butter, melted\nCheesecake batter:\n\u2013 450g cream cheese, softened (leave\nit out at room temp for 1-2 hours before\nusing.)\n\u2013 100g caster/brown sugar\n\u2013 1\u20442 tsp vanilla extract\n\u2013 2 large eggs, lightly beaten\n\u2013 125ml sour cream\n\u2013 12 mini/fun size Twix bars\nPreheat oven to 135\u00b0C.

It\u2019s now\nten days until we will have to ditch the\nfrozen prawns and pizza in the freezer\nand all we can think about is how we\ncan fit in our last steak from Gauchos on\nSloaneAvenue. Tea, for Hannah, will be\nfor the two of us we know we can do\nit because it\u2019s not just for us; it\u2019s for the\npeople out there who suffer from multiple sclerosis.\nMultiple sclerosis (MS) is the most\ncommon neurological condition affecting people of our age. The neurons of\nthe central nervous system are attacked\nby their own immune system, damaging the myelin and eventually the axons\nthemselves. The effects are extensive\nand depend upon the degree of neuron\ndamage, and include emotional effects,\nsuch as depression and anxiety; cognitive effects, such as forgetting recent\nevents; and physical effects, which affect the entire body. Individuals with\nMS can have problems with their vision,\nbalance, bladder control and movement,\nand in some cases they can become severely and rapidly disabled.\nThe cause is still unknown and there\nis no cure. The Multiple Sclerosis Trust\nis a charity that provides information\nand education for the worried, training\nfor professionals, and funding for research into new treatments. As we all\nknow, funding is the key to any successful research \u2013 without the funding the\nresearch doesn\u2019t happen.\nFor Hannah, this is also a very personal challenge, having several family\nand personal friends who suffer with\nMS. We\u2019ve raised \u00a3215 already and we\nhaven\u2019t even started yet \u2013 proving that\nthere are people out there who think we\ncan do it!\nBut this month of veganism won\u2019t\nhave to be hell. We\u2019re going to explore\nall the possibilities and make the meagre diet of a vegan into a delectable\nvariety of satisfying meals \u2013 well we\u2019re\ngoing to have a good go at it anyway.\nAs a good luck present Clare has been\nbought a vegan cookbook and we\u2019re really excited to open it up and get started.\nSo over the next month starting from\nthe 20th of February to the 20th of\nMarch we\u2019re going to be writing weekly\nupdates on our progress in Felix\u2019s Food\nSection. We\u2019ll be including our favourite recipes that we\u2019ve tried and tested,\nwhere to get your best vegan groceries\nfrom, vegan restaurants that do some\ngood nosh, and the latest activities we\u2019ve\nbeen up to to raise awareness for our\ncampaign.

    "content": "A\nlong time ago, in a multiplex not\nso far away, Star Wars: Episode\nI \u2013 The Phantom Menace was released to a baying public, hungry\nfor the most hyped film of the\nmillennium. As parents accompanying their\nchildren fell asleep and grown adults cried\nout in horror at their collective childhood being destroyed by what they were watching on\nscreen, the eight-year-old me sat there, dazzled\nby the then groundbreaking special effects and\nLiam Neeson. Watching it today, of course, I\nnote the many, many obvious flaws and its entire existence as a merchandising opportunity,\nbut it still holds a special place in my cinematic\nmemory. A special place that is in the process\nof being tainted by a 3D re-release this week.\n3D and me? We don\u2019t really get along. The\nproliferation of inter-dimensional spectacles\nhas joined food and drink as one of my (pre-tentious) pet hates of the cinema. I\u2019ve managed\nto put up with it over its various novelty resurgences over the years. Heck, I even enjoyed the\nexperience the first time I saw it, used for an\neducational film in the Science Museum when\nI was a young\u2019un.\nAnd then along came Avatar in 2009. I could\naccept this. What appeared to be an ambitious\nfilm (at least visually) by an accomplished director who clearly wanted to push the format,\ndespite its lingering limitations, was to be\npraised. Hey, at least we were out of the red\nand cyan flimsy plastic glasses phase. No, it\nwas the consequence of Avatar\u2019s success that\noffended me. The complete saturation of cinemas with 3D films, turning the multiplexes into\nfairground rides rather than, well, cinemas.\nThe ten-a-penny 3D cash-ins that emerged\nfrom the shadow of Avatar were relegated to\nFELIX\nFriday 10 February 2012\n26\nfilm.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFilm Editors: John Park\nLucy Wiles\nno less than Best Film at the Academy Awards.\nAnd 3D shows no signs of slowing down at\nthe multiplexes. Other big-hitters scheduled\nfor this year include Marc Webb\u2019s reboot of\nthe Spider-Man franchise with The Amazing\nSpider-Man and not forgetting Peter Jackson\u2019s\nreturn to Middle Earth with the first of his two-parted adaption of The Hobbit.\nThese are big blockbusters, however. And\nI\u2019m wary as to the exact input the directors\nhave had behind the scenes. J.J. Abrams, director of the upcoming Star Trek sequel, has\nstated in an interview that he didn\u2019t \u201cfight\u201d for\nthe use of 3D in the sequel, heralding its use\nas a studio decision over anything else. Peter\nJackson, on the other hand, remains full of admiration for the concept of using 3D to shoot\nfilms.\nIt\u2019s not going anywhere fast \u2013 not as long as\nit remains the industry\u2019s biggest money spinner outside of Christopher Nolan. I still remain\nto be convinced, given Hollywood\u2019s unlearning focus on profit and keeping shareholders\nhappy. Just look at sequels and, well, George\nLucas.\nAt the end of the day, 3D is an elaborate magician\u2019s trick. But it\u2019s a noticeable one. Give\nme a couple of auteurs ready to take the format\nin a new direction, akin to Nolan and IMAX,\nor Scorsese with his Oscar-nominated antics,\nand I\u2019ll start to pay more attention.\nUntil then, it\u2019s 2D for me. That is, after I\u2019ve\nqueued up first in line for Star Wars: Episode I\n\u2013 The Phantom Menace 3D. Sorry, but I really\ndo have to see intergalactic trade disputes in a\nwhole new dimension.\nStar Wars: Episode I \u2013 The Phantom Menace 3D is out now\nFILM\nAre 3D films worth it?\nEven the great Yoda cannot escape this 3D craze \u2013 his force clearly wasn\u2019t strong enough\nslashers (The Final Destination, Final Destination 5), bog-standard action films (Clash of\nthe Titans, anyone?) and animated films, returning to the concept of Episode I\u2019s original\nrelease and becoming a way of drawing youngsters in, at now exorbitant costs.\nUnder normal circumstances, and with such\na bevy of not-so-great films under its belt, I\nwould argue against the format entirely, citing its very existence as a demonstration of the\nworst Hollywood excess; a vehicle for visual\nspectacle over any semblance of emotional res-onance. Cheap thrills dressed up as expensive\nentertainment. In short, a gimmick. I would\ngladly side with the most stringent of naysay-ers, arguing against the dimness that 3D glasses over, sucking the colour from even the most\nvibrant of films. I would argue that the practise\nof 3D films are a means of studios squeezing\nextra cash from its audiences. I realised this\nmost of all with Tron: Legacy. If ever there was\na film most \u2018suited\u2019 to the format, it was this\nvideo-game based fantasy. Unfortunately the\nbest part of it was the Daft Punk soundtrack.\nA feast for the ears rather than the eyes, especially since the 3D glasses dimmed out the\nalready dark imagery.\nAnd yet, here comes Martin Scorsese,\nfresh from pitting Marky Mark against Jason\nBourne in one of his many Very Serious Adult\nFilms (read: The Departed) with Hugo, filmed\nwith 3D firmly in mind. An acclaimed direc-tor, winner of countless awards, taking the\nformat and running with it. Creating what I\nthought never possible, a 3D film with heart, a\n3D film that wows the critics with its heart and\nwell as spectacle, where 3D is no longer a gim-mick, but is used to draw the viewer into an\nemotional journey.

    "content": "COMMENT\nFELIX Friday 10 february 2012 19\nCOMMENT\nFELIX\nB\nack home in the Midlands, there is an extremely popular bus\ncompany known as Trent\nBarton. Like just about\nevery other bus company in the world,\nyou get on the bus, you pay some mon-ey, and they drive you to where you\nwant to go. Some of their competitors\nare faster at getting to some destina-tions, and are sometimes cheaper too.\nSo why do they remain much loved and\nadmired throughout the East Midlands?\nThe reason for this is clear: they value\nthe community they created around\ntheir products.\nIf you have a product, there is a massive amount of potential to tap into the\ncommunity you have. If you have us-ers, they are there for your use. Thinking of bringing out a new brand? Ask\nthem for their opinion. Need a new advertising campaign? Run a promotion\nwith your customers. This increases\ncustomer satisfaction, makes them feel\nappreciated, and can even be good PR\nfor the company.\nIndeed, it just goes to show that a\ncompany is not just about making mon-ey, at least not in the current day and\nage. It\u2019s about looking after your community and making them feel appreciated and part of the family \u2013 the success\nof Trent Barton is testament to this!\nSo why is it, then, that some companies and organizations treat their community badly, if not ignoring them? As\nwe have seen on Felix Online, when\npostgraduates heard of the potential\nclosure of the Holland Club, they were\nup in arms! Having been left completely out of the loop, the postgraduates, the\nNew library door, satisfaction skyrockets?\nAbandon all hope all ye who neglect\nyour community\ncommunity in this case, became angry\nand even felt neglected (as Thomas\nPhillip\u2019s recent Comment article sug-gested).\nSimply looking after the people\nwhose patronage you rely upon could\nhave prevented a lot of this from hap-pening.Alack of communication leaves\nthe community out of the loop and disconnected \u2013 ruining the potentially excellent relationship that an organization\ncould have with its community.\nCollege is not the only one guilty of\nthis. We can look at Elsevier, for ex-ample. Controversial business practices\nalienated the community \u2013 causing\nthem to revolt, as we saw with the recent boycott. By treating them in a way\nthat they could not agree with, their\ncommunity turned against the compa-ny, which did not aid them; and the bad\npress worsened their reputation. Again,\nby simply working with the commu-nity, such as by holding discussions to\nsee if what they were doing was popu-lar, this whole disaster could have been\naverted.\nAnd why is it that organizations such\nas John Lewis are often more trusted\nand liked than competitors such as\nHouse of Fraser (according to a YouGov study)? It\u2019s a well-known fact that\nJohn Lewis is a partnership of which\nall staff has a stake in, and it\u2019s this fair\ntreatment that looks good in the eyes of\nthe community, and increases perception of the brand. Motivated and happy\nstaff provide a better level of service to\nthe customer, who feel that they are being treated well and whose patronage is\nactually valued by the company.\nSome would argue that a public body\nT\nhe new Library entrance\nwas today unveiled in\nwhat is already being\ncalled a stunning coup\nfor students. The en-trance, which whilst still in the same\nplace, now encompasses an incredible\n3.75m2\n, will provide untold numbers\nwith easier access to Imperial\u2019s coveted study areas.\nIt will certainly be a relief to many\nstudents to find that the outrageous\n\u2018face-on\u2019 style previously employed\nhas been scrapped in favour of two,\nmore acceptable, side entrances.\n\u201cFrankly, I was this close to writing\na letter of complaint about the positioning of the entrance \u2013 it was really\ndangerous and offensive\u201d said one\nstudent who wished to remain anony-mous.\nAs well as its clear benefits to students\u2019 comfort and safety, the entrance\nwill also encourage more students to\nuse the facilities contained within. \u201cI\nnever used the library before, but I\u2019ll\ncertainly consider it now,\u201d said another student before adding, \u201calthough\nI\u2019m not sure what I\u2019d do once inside\u201d.\nNot only does the new entrance represent an unheralded show of good\nwill by Imperial College towards its\nstudents, but the building work was\nimpeccably timed. The decision to\nstart building in the winter months\nduring term time was, without a doubt,\nnot straightforward. However it was\nentirely vindicated as students were\nfinally able to appreciate some of the\nbehind-the-scenes work that goes into\nmaking Imperial tick. Sure, the library caf\u00e9 was cold enough to make\nthe crew of Frozen Planet think twice\nabout eating there and more crowded\nthan most places are legally allowed to\nbe, but there was strong positive feedback from interviewed students indicating that the timing of construction\nreally made them feel looked after.\nStudents from the Life Sciences appeared to be amongst the happiest at\nhas a duty to look after the community,\nand that for a private organization this\nis not necessary. And it is true, public\nbodies should \u2013 one can consider it a responsibility of using funds provided by\ntaxpayers (and is also why it is so sad\nthat many establishments are seeming\nto become increasingly more commercially focused \u2013 run as companies and\nnot institutions). And it is true, public\nbodies should: one can consider it a responsibility of using funds provided by\ntaxpayers. This is why it is so sad that\nmany establishments seem to become\nincreasingly more commercially fo-cused, run as companies and not insti-tutions. But private companies should\ntake heed too \u2013 just because the public\ndoesn\u2019t run the company doesn\u2019t mean\nthey don\u2019t have a view over how they\nare run and how they interact.\nRuining this relationship helps no-the sight of the entrance. The department underwent serious perestroika\nlast year resulting in excellent lecturers losing their jobs and many students feeling betrayed by their uni-versity; however, reaction has been\noverwhelmingly positive. \u201cAt first\nI was doubtful that a new entrance\ncould repair the cracks created by the\nrestructuring process, but now I\u2019ve\nseen the entrance myself, it\u2019s certainly worth three or four good lecturers\u201d\nsaid 2nd year biochemist Lee Sewell.\nWith this kind of investment in stu-dents, Imperial will surely look forward to rocketing up the student satisfaction rankings for 2012.\nbody. The company or organization\nin question loses trust, and as a result,\ncustom and reputation. It becomes less\nlikely that people recommend friends\nto their services, and they can even\nbecome labelled as \u2018nasty people\u2019 or\n\u2018bullies\u2019 \u2013 we just have to look at the\nrecent outrage over the bonus of RBS\nboss Stephen Heston for an example of\nthe ill-feeling that can result from such\na disconnect. In my eyes, it would not\nbe unfair to call it commercial suicide.\nLuckily for employees everywhere,\ndressing up in a giant mango costume\n(as Trent Barton has its staff do) is not\na necessary part of nurturing the relationship a company or organization has\nwith its community. But if trust and\ncustom is wanted, respecting the community is a necessary part, and is one\nthat must not be forgotten in the urge to\nmake money and boost profits.\nLaurence de\nLussy Kubisa\nMotivated and\nhappy staff provide\na better level of\nservice to the\ncustomer... whose\npatronage is\nactually valued by\nthe company\n\u201c\nMotivat\nMotiva\nhappy s\nhappy\n\u201d\nlued by\nlued by\nny\nny\nIf a giant mango can\u2019t get you to ditch the car, then what will?\nPhilip Kent\n\n"

    "content": "According to new analysis of more than 160\nyears worth of data, the North Star may be wasting away, shedding an amount of gas equivalent\nto up to the mass of the Earth each year.\nThe North Star, also known as Polaris, has\nbeen used by navigators for centuries, as its\nalignment with the Earth\u2019s rotational axis\nmeans it always sits directly above the North\nPole. It is also a \u2018Cepheid Variable\u2019 star, meaning it pulsates, getting dimmer and brighter as\nthe conflicting forces of gravity inwards and\nradiation pressure outwards constantly tug the\nouter layers back and forth from its dense, burning core.\nThis \u2018pulse\u2019 of the star, with a period of\naround 4 days, has been observed by ancient\nastronomers for hundreds of years. In 2004,\nDavid Turner, of St. Mary\u2019s University in Halifax, Canada, compiled an archive of these mea-surements. His analysis, including data stretching back as long ago as 1844, showed that the\nNorth Star\u2019s pulse was slowing down. Turner\njustified this increase in the star\u2019s time period of\naround 4.5 seconds per year by concluding that\nthe star was in the early stages of its evolution\non its first crossing of the \u2018Cepheid instability\nstrip\u2019, and still burning only hydrogen \u2013 a trademark of a young star.\nHowever, Hilding Neilson of the University\nof Bonn, Germany, was not so sure. Combining\nhis own recent observations with Turner\u2019s archived data, Neilson and colleagues compared\nthe star\u2019s measured behaviour with state of the\nart models of stellar evolution. They didn\u2019t\nmatch up.\n\u201cOnly if the star is losing a lot of mass can\nthat [discrepancy] be resolved,\u201d says Neilson,\nreferring to the North Star\u2019s mysteriously decreasing pulse. In a paper published recently in\nthe Astrophysical Journal Letters, he explains\nhow the time period data is inconsistent with\nall regular phases of stellar evolution, and, in\ncontradiction to Turner, he asserts that the star\nis old, having passed through the red giant stage\nand already burning Helium. In Neilson\u2019s mod-el, as the star pulses, swathes of gas are pushed\nout from it in waves, as the pent-up light bursts\nthrough the star\u2019s outer layers. He concludes\nthat the North Star must be losing mass, at\nthe rate of around one Earth mass each year \u2013\nequivalent to roughly a millionth of the mass of\nthe star itself.\nThe result is particularly exciting because it\u2019s\nthe first truly strong argument for such extreme\nmass loss in a Cepheid star. While most suspected examples of Cepheid stars losing mass\nNorth Star is shrinking\nAll other stars appear to rotate around the North star as the Earth spins\nare uncertain, as they are based on shaky observations of the surrounding stellar material,\nthis novel method employs the wealth of data\nalready gathered about the North Star, to make\nactual quantifiable measurements of the rate at\nwhich it is wasting away.\nThe quest for understanding the mechanisms\nof the North Star is not over, however, and\nTurner is the first to admit that \u201cthere are many\nmysteries about Polaris that defy simple explanation.\u201d In the coming months and years, new\ndata from the Hubble Space Telescope about\nits distance from Earth, and its luminosity, will\nhopefully help solve the mystery once and for\nall of what exactly is going on deep inside the\nstar we thought we knew so well.\nDOI:10.1088/2041-8205/745/2/L32\nIn a paper recently published in Science, a\nteam from the University of Manchester has\nreported that graphene oxide is capable of\nselectively filtering water molecules, leaving\nall other types of molecule blocked. This is a\nparticularly surprising result for the team, who,\nfrom previous research, expected the graphene\nderivative to be completely impermeable.\nMore surprising with this research is that\nwater permeated through the membrane at a\nrate very similar to that of water permeating\nthrough a system with no membrane.\nThe team used a cylinder filled with water\nvapour to conduct the investigation. A seal\nmade of porous copper plates coated with gra-phene oxide was used to cover the container,\nand then the loss of mass of the cylinder over\ntime was measured.\nAdditionally, when the cylinder was filled\nwith other gases (such as hexane, ethanol, and\nhelium), there was almost no loss of mass over\na 24-hour period. This shows that the membrane prevented any gases other than water\nvapour from escaping.\nThis seems to be a property of graphene ox-ide, rather than graphene itself \u2013 when the film\nwas made of chemically derived graphene,\npermeability dropped again.\nProducing substances capable of blocking\nhelium is a non-trivial task, with even glass\nallowing some to permeate through. The\nfact that graphene oxide allows water to pass\nthrough almost unimpeded, yet completely\nblocks other gases, surprised scientists.\nUnder normal conditions, graphene oxide\nwould have water molecules in capillaries located within the layers (where the other gaseous particles would otherwise travel), and\nit is these molecules that prevent the flow of\nother gases. Water can still flow through, as\nthe water at the top of the layer evaporates off\nleaving .\nIn low humidity (i.e. when there is not much\nwater vapour in the cylinder), the water within\nthe layers is not replenished when it evaporates\nfrom the top, causing the capillaries to shrink.\nThis also prevents water molecules escaping.\nApplications for this could include filtration\nand separation, and could find use in situations\nwhere it is desired to remove just water from\na sample. In a more humorous test, the team\nsealed a bottle of vodka using the same mecha-nism, and found that the vodka became stronger over time as the water vapour evaporated\nthrough the seal.\nDOI: 10.1126/science.1211694\nPhilip Kent\nFELIX\nFriday 10 February 2012\n12\nscience.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nScience Editors: Kelly Oakes\nAlexander Karapetian\nSCIENCE\nIn brief\nArianna Sorba\nAnxiety\nby Maria Veiga\nLast year, at an intelligence squared event, James\nWatson stated that one of the biggest improvements in medicine would be personalised genome\nsequencing, whereby patients will have a personalised healthcare plan developed from their genome sequence. Personalised genome sequencing is now becoming a reality in Norway, less than\na decade after the first human genome was fully\nsequenced.\nNorway\u2019s plan is to focus on cancer care. Several phases have been outlined. Initially, in the\npilot phase the Norwegian Cancer Genomics Consortium will look at 3,000 previous tumour biopsies to better understand how different cancer\nmutations respond to drugs. Furthermore, 1,000\npatients will also have their genomes sequenced.\nThe next phase will see specific clinical, computing and laboratory infrastructure being built.\nAlthough, Norway is the first to incorporate genome sequencing into its national health system;\nit is not the first country to have personalised med-icine. The UK and USA already have personalised\nmedicine; just not on as large a scale as Norway\u2019s\nproposed plans. In the UK, the NHS is currently\nonly conducting research, with DNA extraction,\nstorage and testing of tumour genomes. In Boston, USA, researchers at Massachusetts general\nhospital have developed a test for 15 genes which\nare already targeted by current cancer drugs. Norway\u2019s plans differ to Boston\u2019s targeted testing,\nfor within their healthcare system they plan to\nsequence entire genomes. It will be interesting\nto see which country\u2019s strategy is preferable. Norway could just be putting in place infrastructure for\ngeneral personalised healthcare, which does not\njust focus on cancer treatment. Furthermore, who\nknows what the extra data could reveal, perhaps\neven mutations in other genes.\nIt is exciting to see how research and healthcare are merging together more and more. Who\nknows what could be revealed through using personalised genome sequencing and how the future\nof healthcare will be shaped.\nJula Humphries\nNorway puts genome sequencing\nin national health system\nWang Jinglei and Jia Hao, NASA\nGraphene oxide filters out water\n90% vodka, anyone?\n\n"

It is clear that Viggo Mortensen\nis a very polite, very considered man,\nwho has clearly spent a great deal of\ntime studying Freud for this role, and\nseemed happy to have a conversation\nwith us about it all.\nHaving visited the Freud museums\nin both London and Vienna, Mortensen\ntells us how he enjoyed getting a real\nfeel for the places \u2013 Freud\u2019s home in\nVienna was temporarily ransacked by\nthe film crew for props and artifacts, so\nthe London home actually gave him the\nbest idea of what Freud\u2019s home looked\nlike. \u201cI liked thinking of him in the\ngarden, seeing the images of him back\nthere,\u201d he says, while wandering around\nthe room and looking interestedly into\nthe garden, \u201cThat always helps me as an\nactor.\u201d The film itself was mostly filmed\nin a studio in Cologne, Germany, where\nthe interiors of Jung\u2019s house and Freud\u2019s\noffice were copied down to the very last\npossible detail \u2013 Mortensen tells us that\nthe film\u2019s director David Cronenberg\neven had the blueprints of both houses\nso that the sets were really perfect. The\nexterior for Jung\u2019s house was filmed\nin southern Germany, as well as a few\nother little scenes in various places.\nIt\u2019s well known that Mortensen is\nkeen on researching his roles, immersing themselves in their lives as much\nas he can. When asked whether there\nwas simply too much to absorb with as\ncomplex a character as Freud, he spoke\nabout the impossibility to absorb a person\u2019s whole life in such a short time\nframe. \u201cIf I had a choice, I\u2019d always\nask for more time,\u201d he shrugs. In his\nshort period of preparation however, it\nseems Mortensen managed a great deal,\namassing vast quantities of articles, papers and descriptions of Freud, as well\nas reading through some of Freud\u2019s own\nwork. He assures us that understanding\nFreud\u2019s behaviour and mannerisms is\nmore important for an actor to grasp the\ncharacter than simply learning about\nin that play than in my last ten or fifteen\nyears in filming,\u201d he says, seriously.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no saying cut, you just figure\nit out; it\u2019s like an hour and forty minutes long take. I really loved it, loved\nthe connection with the audience.\u201d\nMortensen speaks about how he likes\nhearing how the audience truly reacts\nto a film, and admits that he has been\nto see his movies aside from premieres.\n\u201cIt\u2019s more interesting to see them with a\nregular paying audience because there\u2019s\nno favouritism, just people reacting\nhonestly\u2026 that\u2019s probably the best way\nto see it,\u201d he muses.\nMoving back onto the subject of\nFreud, Mortensen is asked what scene\nhe would have liked to have elaborated\non in A Dangerous Method, given the\nopportunity.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think anything was missing from the slice of time that we were\ndealing with,\u201d he says, \u201cBut it might\nhave been interesting to see Freud in\nthe United States in 1909 lecturing and\ninteracting with Americans, not just\nAmerican academics, but American\naudiences. [A brief scene in the movie\nshows Freud and Jung getting onto the\nboat to go to America for a conference.]\nHe had a lot of preconceived ideas -not all good, mostly not good - about\nAmericans!\u201d Talking about a very well-acted (not that Mortensen mentioned\nthat himself!) scene where Jung has a\nfirst class ticket on the boat, and Freud\ndoesn\u2019t react to it although clearly put\nout, Mortensen says, \u201cI think he [Freud]\nwas a natural gentleman, and although\nthe Jungians or anti-Freudians might\ndisagree, I would say that he was essentially a modest person and a generous\nperson\u2026 But he could also be very cut-ting, he didn\u2019t take well to being contradicted\u2026 He was insecure - like we\nall are.\u201d Which again brings to light just\nhow much work Mortensen put into the\nrole.\nWe idly discuss how much we enjoyed the film, even though a few of us\nhad very little knowledge of Freud or\nJung. \u201cI don\u2019t think you have to know\nanything about psychoanalysis, or the\nhistory of psychoanalysis, to enjoy this\nmovie,\u201d says Mortensen, \u201cBecause it\u2019s\nessentially about people who are in-teresting, who are intelligent, who are\nvery ambitious and keen to make their\nmark in their field, but who are also\nvery competitive, jealous insecure and\nbehave often as childishly as the people\nthey are supposed to be helping.\u201d\nAnd with that, and a brief handshake,\nhe was ushered from the room to other\nduties. And I didn\u2019t shriek \u201cAragorn!\u201d\nat him once.\nA Dangerous Method is out today\nFreud\u2019s academic ideas. Mortensen\nstudied Freud\u2019s posture, the way he\nsat, how he held his cigars, and how he\ncomposed himself in order to get a clear\npicture to represent \u2013 quite a feat for\nMortensen to have accomplished from\nthe limited descriptions of his character.\nHe adds that he had to smoke a lot of cigars on set \u2013 \u201cHe [Freud] smoked twen-ty-two [a day], but I had to smoke many\nmore parts of cigars!\u201d he laughs, adding\nthat it was hard to get used to, as well as\nbeing hard to recover from. However, it\nwasn\u2019t all bad as the cigars hold happy\nchildhood memories for Mortensen,\nwhose grandfather (who was a farmer\nin Denmark) smoked them, and his\ngrandparents house smelled like it.\n\u201cThe sense of smell is definitely underrated,\u201d he says.\nIt was mentioned in the interview that\nFreud\u2019s witty side is not so well known,\nand it was asked whether Mortensen\nwas keen to show this side of him. He\nspoke about his initial worry that Freud\nwas just a \u2018stern academic type\u2019, and\nthat his portrayal would be hugely difficult \u2013 especially as his part in this film\ninvolves long stints of intellectual dia-logue. On discovering his love of jokes\nand humour, however, Mortensen was\nless concerned, and found out more\nabout this side of Freud. \u201cHe even supposedly once met up with Mark Twain,\nand they sat and smoked cigars and told\njokes for hours,\u201d he smiled. Unlike his\nacademic peers, Freud chose to spurn\nLatin and Greek vocabulary, and spoke\nin what Mortensen describes as \u2018good,\nclear German\u2019. He didn\u2019t always take\nhimself too seriously, and made many\njokes and witty asides \u2013 untroubled as\nto whether they were recognised or not.\n\u201cHe was very English, I think, in that\nway \u2013 had a very English sense of humour,\u201d remarked Mortensen, even going as far as to likening Freud\u2019s sharp,\ndry sense of humour to his director\u2019s;\n\u201cIt maybe helped make it a such a good\nmovie.\u201d\nTalk moved onto David Cronenberg,\nthe director of A Dangerous Method.\nWhen asked if Cronenberg told his the\nreason for his casting, Mortensen says,\nmodestly, \u201cHe never came right out and\nsaid it\u2026 I guess there was something\nright.\u201d He remembers how much fun it\nis working on set with Cronenberg, and\ncites this as one of the main reasons he\ndecided to take on the role, alongside\nCronenberg\u2019s interesting ideas and attention to detail. \u201cIts\u2019 fun working with\nDavid\u2026 he\u2019s excited, running around,\u201d\ngrins Mortensen. \u201cDavid remembers\nthat, after all, it is play. It\u2019s make-be-lieve. It\u2019s a game which he enjoys playing.\u201d Despite many critics saying that\nthis is a departure from Cronenberg\u2019s\nusual type of movie, Mortensen insists\nthat it\u2019s not so strange. \u201cI thought Eastern Promises was quite different from\nA History of Violence, and this film was\nquite different from those two.\u201d He goes\non to praise his director: \u201cI don\u2019t think\nhe imitates himself\u2026 he\u2019s not at a lack\nfor good ideas. Some living directors\nwho\u2019ve been making movies for forty\nyears like he has\u2026 become less interesting as directors, and seem trapped by\npeoples perceptions of them.\u201d\nHaving discussed the idea of directors becoming less interesting because\nof \u2018staying safe\u2019 strategies, it was wondered aloud whether some actors might\nhave the same problem. \u201cAs you get\nolder you get tired and it takes a lot to\nchallenge yourself. But then it can be\ninvigorating, probably rejuvenating,\u201d\nsays Mortensen, enthusiastically. He\nclearly feels strongly about this point,\nand it\u2019s safe to say he doesn\u2019t shy away\nfrom a different kind of role. \u201cBut you\ndo have to face it \u2013 with fears of \u2018am I\ngoing to fail this time\u2019 \u2018I haven\u2019t tried\nthis before\u2019\u2026 some actors get tired and\nthey get lazy. And it\u2019s safer to repeat\nsomething you know works, and that\nyou have a target audience for. Some\nactors perfect [their repeated role] in\na \u2018zen fashion\u2019, some challenge themselves to new roles. \u201cActors who like\nmyself are terrified of doing a bad job\u2026\nyou don\u2019t want to let anyone down,\ndon\u2019t want to let yourself down,\u201d he\ntell us. \u201cAnd it takes a lot of work to do\nit, so you want to do it right\u2026 Life is\nshort, why not try and do the best you\ncan?\u201d\nMortensen clearly prefers to take a\nrisk once in a while and work hard to\nperfect a role \u2013 he clearly is unhappy\nwith the idea of \u2018staling\u2019 and being\nthe same kind of character over and\nover. \u201cIt\u2019s approaching new things that\nmakes me afraid.\u201d He is happy to take\na gamble on a role, providing a good\ndirector he can trust feels he\u2019s up to the\npart. \u201cAlthough I don\u2019t think any other\ndirector in the world except Cronenberg\nwould have thought that I was right for\nFreud!\u201d he chuckles. Having just finished a run of the theatre production\n\u2018Purgatorio\u2019 in Spain, which involved\njust two actors (Mortensen and an ac-tress) on stage for almost two hours,\nwith no interval and no scene changes,\nMortensen knows about a challenge. \u201cIt\nwas terrifying,\u201d he remembers, \u201cThose\nfirst performances I was thinking \u2018what\nhave I done?\u2019, but by the end I loved it.\u201d\nHe adds that he felt he owed it to the\npeople who wanted to see the play and\nowed it to himself to step up to the challenge of intense theatre, and he will always be glad that he did, as he should -the play was a resounding success with\nvery good reviews. \u201cI learned more\nabout acting and thinking on your feet\nFelix Film talks to Aragorn\nLucy Wiles interviews Viggo Mortensen, the star of A Dangerous Method\nDear Mr Mortensen, will you be my Valentine?\n\n"

    "content": "Following Galliano\u2019s dismissal just days before Dior\u2019s A/W 2011-12 show, the whirlwind\nof rumours about who would take his place of\n14 years, leading one of fashion\u2019s most monumental houses has continued to distract from\nthe fashions on the catwalk, replacing the\nfantasy with flurries of intrigue. Who would\nbe able to fill these prodigious shoes? No\nviable options have presented themselves,\nwith all prime candidates seemingly content in the positions they currently hold.\nFrom Louis Vuitton\u2019s alluringly versatile Marc Jacobs, Givenchy\u2019s prince\nof darkness Riccardo Tisci, the young\nand rebellious Haider Ackermann,\nJil Sander\u2019s modern man Raf Simons, and even the designer of\nperfect dresses Azzedine Ala\u00efa,\nthe position remains unfilled\nthree seasons later.\nNevertheless, the house of\nDior has continued to fill its slot at Paris\nfashion week under the undeniably weaker\nhand of Bill Gaytten who spent 15 years as\nthe right-hand man of Galliano. Gone are Galliano\u2019s dramatic tales of dark glamour, and\nnever again will our hearts flutter at the sight\nof a tulip dress or yearn to go riding sidesaddle in masterfully tailored jackets before\nbeing swept away to a ball swathed in layers\nof satin.\nThis is not to say that Gaytten hasn\u2019t made\na fair attempt at trying to fill the position unceremoniously laid at his door, but given 15\nyears of working under the promiscuous visionary of design that Galliano undoubtedly\nwas, you might have suspected a somewhat\nstronger desire to show the world his own\nwell of pent up talent. Alas, that has not been\nthe case. Instead, the former\nhouse of dreams has given\nus season after season of\nrestrained, safe designs\nand far too heavy a reliance on Christian\nDior\u2019s legendary archives,\nresulting in\ncraftsmanship\nof John Galliano by continuing\nto buy, and hence\nsupport, the house\nthat so quickly\nturned on its own\nsaviour? Indisputably, what Galliano\nsaid was inexcusable,\nbut do buyers not realise\nthat the items they now\npurchase no longer hold\nthat enchanting feel that\nGalliano breathed into his\nevery design, and the clear\nlove and understanding he\nhad of the legend of Dior?\nIt is a prerequisite that a designer taking the reins of a\nA\ns unlikely as it may seem, I\nhave found myself swapping\nthe glossy pages of Vogue for\nthe less conveniently sized\nFinancial Times this week as\nthe recently realised flurry of financial figures\ndrag my attention away from the conventional\npre-fashion-week buzz.\nInstead of delighting in the prospect of seeing Michael Kors\u2019 first post-IPO collection of\nluxe loungewear in New York next week, or\neagerly awaiting to be swept away by Sarah\nBurton\u2019s lace and leather embellished goddesses at Alexander McQueen later in Paris;\nI find myself, rather uncharacteristically, poring over Christian Dior\u2019s annual earnings re-port.\nSimilar to an oblivious fat seal skimming\nthe turbulent waters of the melting Arctic\noceans, not only has the luxury market continued to plump out its profits in such harsh economic times, with multinational luxury goods\nconglomerate LVMH\u2019s sales up 14% from\nlast year on a like-to-like basis, the rumour-enshrouded house of Christian Dior has managed to ride out the storm with increased sales\nof 21% over the last three quarters of 2011.\nInstead of joining the shareholders of said\ncompanies in celebrating such figures as we\ncount down the days until the catwalks kick\nin, I find myself agonizing over the future of\nhigh-end fashion and grieving for one of the\nindustry\u2019s most talented creative geniuses.\nThe scandal that erupted just under a year\nago concerning anti-Semitic remarks made\nby John Galliano (former Creative Director\nat Christian Dior) sent a tornado through the\nindustry and has since become a story deeply\ncarved into the gilt-edged history books of\nfashion.\nhouse that does not bear their own\nname must not only have a definite\nknowledge of the history and culture of the\nbrand, but also their own vision which must\ninspire and convince consumers of the next\ngeneration that their designs will endure, just\nlike the illustrious name of Christian Dior.\nThe despairing answer that I must postulate\nis that the majority of customers who fund\nthese labels no longer care about the designers behind the house\u2019s name. Rather than\nrelish in the artistic talent and craftsmanship\nof the garment they don, they care only that\nits price tag is beyond what their dry cleaner\nearns in half a year and that upon removing\ntheir plush coat, their contemporaries\u2019 butlers\nwill see a famous brand name sewn into the\nnape of the silk-satin lining.\nAs far as I\u2019m concerned, this must be considered to be fashion sacrilege. Though it\nseems that the opinion of the nouveau riche\nwith their glimmering Chanel sunglasses,\nmonogrammed Louis Vuitton bags and jewel\ncoloured Gucci fur coats couldn\u2019t care less\nabout Karl Lagerfeld, Marc Jacobs or Frida\nGiannini and co, let alone the disgraced and\nfallen John Galliano. As long as they feel that\nwhat they\u2019re wearing is distinctively covet-able, to them, nothing else matters.

Fashion is\ninstant language.\u201d\nThis month will mark the rebirth of FashionSoc.\nA new enthusiastic committee has formed, and we\nare working hard to restore the society and save it\nfrom dormancy. To make up for lost time, we are organising as many workshops, events and socials as\npossible, so the rest of this term is jam-packed with\ncreative activities. On top of this we are giving our\nmembers the opportunity to experience the fashion\nworld through trips to exhibitions and shows, because the best way to learn to is be well-informed in\nthe work of others.\nOur aim for FashionSoc is to provide members\nwith the opportunity to learn a variety of design and\nmaking techniques in our weekly workshops that\nwill run from February 14 where we will be decorating masks in RSM G1, (and will occur every Tuesday\nevening 6:30-8:30 henceforth). We are also looking\nto put on our own fashion show in May and are looking for creative talent and enthusiasm to fuel it. So,\nregardless of if your style is flamboyant and wacky\nor classic and under-stated, as long as you\u2019re pas-sionate, then we would love to have you on board.\nIf interested, join our Facebook group and mailing\nlists for regular updates.\n14/02: Mask Workshop (RSM G1)\n17/02: Masquerade Bar Crawl\n25/02, 26/02: Fusion\n04/03: Fashion Museum Trip\n11/03: Day trip to Bath\n18/03: Vintage Fashion Fair (Hammersmith)\nWorkshops every Tuesday 6:30-8:30 at Imperial\nCollege\nWanted: Fashionistas with a penchant for art and design\nLove to sketch and stitch?

    "content": "S\naariselk\u00e4 is a small tourist village in mountainous\nnorthern Finland which offers a beautiful landscape,\nvarious snow-based activities to get involved in and, of course, an\nopportunity to see the Northern Lights.\n1. Freeze to death\nThis is the Arctic Circle, which means\ntemperatures that will probably freeze\nurine in your urethra if you ever found\nyourself unable to find a toilet. Temperatures are typically about -15\u00b0C,\nregularly dipping below -20\u00b0C without including wind chill. There\u2019s not\nmuch difference between day and\nnight because, let\u2019s face it, Saariselk\u00e4\u2019s\nfeeble winter sun is nothing more than\na symbolic gesture. As long as you\u2019re\ndressed in warm water and windproof\nclothes, you\u2019ll barely feel the ele-ments, especially when you\u2019re working up a sweat climbing up hills or racing through (and inevitably followed\nby tripping into) foot-thick snow. Unfortunately, I cannot guarantee you\u2019ll\nstay warm if, say, when opening the\ndoor to your cabin the key breaks inside the lock and you have to wait an\nhour outside for some guys to jimmy\nthe door open with a crowbar. Making\nthings worse is imagining the sauna\nthat you could\u2019ve been in all this time\nrather than staving off frostbite while\nyou try to pry the key out with a Swiss\narmy knife.\n2. Toboggan down a slope\nMaking gravity do all the hard work\nfor you has always been entertain-ing. The problem arises when you\u2019re\ncareering down a slope at ridiculous\nspeeds but you suddenly need to steer\nto avoid an impromptu meeting with\na tree, which is a lot less trivial for a\nbeginner than those little Finnish kids\nwhizzing past you make it seem. Or\nmore awkwardly, you could be on a\ncollision course with someone walking up the slope who dodges left and\nright to avoid you, much like trying\nnot to walk into someone in a street,\nexcept at much higher speed. You use\nyour legs to dig into the snow, which\nworks rather well except it then throws\nThings to do in Saariselk\u00e4\n\u201cThe winter sun is\nnothing more than a\nsymbolic gesture\u201d\na load of snow straight into your face,\nblinding you and making you feel like\nyou\u2019ve just been socked in the face by\na snowman.\n3. Go snowmobiling\nRiding machines with motors not much\nsmaller than themselves is always a\nlaugh tinged with the risk of forcing\nyou to ride a wheelchair forever af-ter. Several companies offer snowmobile trips outside town to get a better\nglimpse of the Northern Lights that are\npretty safe since you\u2019re stuck behind\nwhoever\u2019s behind you and no room to\novertake. It\u2019s a bit like being in traffic\nbut with better scenery. Except you can\njust slow right down, build up a bit of\ndistance between the vehicle in front\nand then slam on the accelerator if you\nfeel like the ride is too pedestrian for\nyou. Just keep your eyes peeled for the\nstop signs where roads cross the path,\nbecause if you\u2019re crossing those at 60\nkilometres an hour when a car is coming down the road like I did, there\u2019s no\nchance in hell either of you are going\nto brake in time on snow and ice. There\nis also the hazard of doing this down\na stretch that isn\u2019t quite as flat as you\nthought, which results in the snowmobile rocking side-to-side momentarily\nlosing contact with the ground, making you shit bricks for a few seconds\nas you prepare to flip over. Apart from\nthat though, it\u2019s perfectly safe, I swear.\n4. Eat reindeer\nYeah, they\u2019re cute; get over it and tuck\nin. You\u2019d expect it to taste a bit like\nvenison but instead has a mild beef\nflavour, which isn\u2019t that exciting but\nbeef is just as expensive there so why\nnot? Besides, you can sing Jingle Bells\nin a maniacal voice between mouthfuls of braised reindeer, pretending\nyou\u2019re eating Rudolph or Blitzen. If\nthat doesn\u2019t take your fancy, you can\nget it in pretty much any other form:\nsmoked (utterly delicious with saut\u00e9ed\npotatoes and cheese), thinly sliced and\ncured (or eaten frozen) - even canned.\n5. Burn money\nIt seems like a common theme among\nNordic countries that the price of everything is as if they\u2019re using the notes\nto fuel a smelter to melt the coins into\nmodel reindeer. A simple reindeer\nburger will set you back \u20ac5, while a\nproper meal is a \u201cgood deal\u201d at about\n\u20ac13. You may want to pack your suitcase with food to make things more af-fordable, which has surprisingly little\nshame to it given how much you\u2018ll\nsave. Oh, and if you want to get festive bring a bottle - there\u2019s a monopoly\non the Finnish spirit industry pushing a\nlitre of vodka up to about \u00a340.\n6. See the Northern Lights\nStrictly speaking, you don\u2019t need to go\nto Finland, or even Northern Europe\nfor this. On occasion there\u2019s enough\nsolar activity to make the Aurora Borealis visible as far south as Newcastle,\nwhich is somewhat galling for anyone\nwho travelled specifically to see them.\nNevertheless, they are pretty much\nwhat you expect them to be: green,\nwispy cloud-like formations that dance\nacross the sky that take your breath\naway if the -20\u00b0C air doesn\u2019t do that\nalready. If you book more than a week\nin advance it suddenly becomes a bit\nof a lottery whether you see them owing to weather conditions. Thankfully,\nSaariselk\u00e4 has enough to offer to make\nthe trip worth it in the event clouds do\nruin your day, as if they\u2019ve sensed that\nyou\u2019ve come from England.\n7. Buy racistly-advertised child toys\nGood luck working out what emotion\nthat facial expression (bottom right\nimage) is meant to convey. The racism isn\u2019t immediately evident until\nyou notice the chain round his neck\nwhich either implies he\u2019s too poor to\nafford even a gold-plated one (damn\nyou, Finnish income tax!) or that he\u2019s\nmeant to be a slave. What we can\ndefinitely infer though is that Finnish\nchildren get mad amounts of pocket\nmoney: you need at least \u20ac20 to get\nall ten grills.\n8. Throw your circadian rhythm into\nchaos\nThe good thing about long nights during winter is that you get a huge window to see the Northern Lights. The bad\nthing is that the day lasts maybe four\nhours in January which means that the\nSun pops up slowly, only to come back\ndown before it has a chance to go from\nred to yellow. The result is looking up\nat the sky and having no idea whether\nit\u2019s sunrise or sunset, and when you\u2019re\nout hiking in the wilderness constantly\nwondering whether you\u2019ve wandered\npast the border into Russia, it\u2019s easy to\nlose all sense of time.\n9. Pretend you\u2019re on an alien planet.\nFirst, you have the Finnish language:\nit\u2019s hopelessly unlike any European one\napart from some in the Baltic countries,\nbut nobody cares about those. It can be\nrather frustrating being unable to make\nheads or tails of it if you have a general\nknowledge of a wide range of European\nlanguages, but in practice you\u2019ll have\nno trouble because everyone speaks\nEnglish there. Throw in the clouds that\nglow orange from the lights below, tree\nlines in the horizon that look like cloud\ncover at night and everything on the\nground glazed with snow and you have\nyourself the perfect setting for a sci-fi\nflick.\nTRAVEL\nFELIX\nFriday 10 february 2012\n32\ntravel.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nTravel Editors: Dushi Arumuganesan\nChris Richardson\nWhat\u2019s the time, Mr. Wolf?

    "content": "Tips & Hacks\nEtymotic MC2 headset review\nThe Etymotic MC2 headset is an in-ear, noise isolating headphone and microphone combination\npromising high-quality sound. It also has a single\nbutton that can be used for tasks such as answering calls or pausing what\u2019s playing. I\u2019ve been using\nthem for the last week, and I have to say I\u2019m finding them pretty good. Of course, compared to a\nparticular known-brand of white earphones (don\u2019t\nask \u2013 my old earphones broke), most headphones\nare going to be a decent improvement. However, I\nalso have a separate pair of over-the-ear \u2018phones,\nso they\u2019ll be my point of reference instead.\nLet\u2019s first look at what you get for your \u00a375. Etymotic supply four different pairs of eartips, so\nyou can choose the style most suited to your ear.\nThere\u2019s also a custom ear-mould service avail-able, but at another \u00a375 I decided not to try it. You\nare additionally given a spare pair of filters, and a\nzipper pouch to store the headset in. While it\u2019s no\nmetal box, it gives more protection than nothing.\nThe cable is meant to be reinforced with Kevlar\ntoo, which can\u2019t be a bad thing for durability.\nSo how good are those supplied eartips at shutting out the distracting sounds of the outside\nworld? It depends on what eartip you prefer. I use\nthe foam ones, which are great. My experiences\nwith the two sizes of three-flange variety show\nthey perform well also. The \u2018glider\u2019 tips don\u2019t stay\nin my ear however, so I can\u2019t really comment \u2013\nbut I assume they\u2019re not as great, as otherwise\nthey\u2019d fit better. My tips are comfortable too, with\nprolonged use causing no discomfort whatsoever.\nNow for the important part \u2013 the sound quality.\nWhile not the most expensive headset/earphones\non the market, you\u2019d expect good results for your\nmoney with the MC2s. I\u2019ve listened to a range of\nmusic genres as well as spoken voice, and I can\nsafely say the earphones don\u2019t disappoint. While\nthey\u2019re not the \u2018bassiest\u2019 headphones in the\nworld, you can hear each note of bass, and the\noverall sound they deliver is full and rich. Those\nlittle nuances in the music that you don\u2019t notice\nin cheaper headphones are audible, and you can\nhear all the parts of a given track. Overall, I\u2019ve\nbeen impressed with the quality of audio that the\nearphones put out.\nThe microphone part of the headset worked well\nfor a long telephone conversation I had while in-doors, but apparently when outside there was a\nfair bit of ambient noise that made it difficult to\nhear me. Other than that though, the Etymotic\nMC2 is a good quality headset that delivers on the\nsound front.\nChris Bowers\nI have to say, I\u2019m not much of a tablet man. If\nI really must surf on the move I\u2019m perfectly\nhappy with my BlackBerry, and my laptop satisfies all my mobile computing needs. However, when a friend of mine bought the new\nAsus Transformer Prime tablet, I had to give it\na go \u2013 so I borrowed it.\nThe tablet\u2019s predecessor \u2013 the Transformer\n\u2013 was a good tablet according to its reviews.\nPerhaps its most distinguishing feature was the\nkeyboard dock, which makes its return with\nthe Prime. This fully integrates with the tablet to give you what is basically a netbook \u2013 it\nfeatures a trackpad and a full keyboard with\nall the important Android keys, so you won\u2019t\nbe switching between typing and touching the\nscreen. It also has a USB port, SD card slot\nand an in-built battery pack, which boosts the\ntablet\u2019s in-use battery life from 12 hours to 18.\nThe Prime however, has more than just its\ndock to its name. It\u2019s one of the first major tablet to feature Ice Cream Sandwich (which is\nlovely on it), and indeed to use nVidia\u2019s quad-core Tegra 3 chip. All cutting edge so far, I\u2019m\nsure you\u2019ll agree. The rest of the hardware\ndoesn\u2019t let down either, with a 10.1\u201d Super\nIPS+, Gorilla Glass screen, 32/64GB of internal storage and an eight-megapixel camera on\nthe rear with flash, to name just some.\nOf course, statistics and specifications only\nsay so much about a product \u2013 you have to use\nit to really know how good it is. However, with\nthe Transformer Prime, it doesn\u2019t take you very\nlong to reach your decision \u2013 this tablet is really nice to use, with or without the dock. The\ntablet itself is very responsive, and the dock\u2019s\nkeyboard was good when tested using the supplied Polaris Office.\nIn fact, there are occasions when using the\ntablet that really make you enjoy using it. For\nexample, closing a background task/applica-tion sounds boring, but swiping its tile off to\nthe side of the screen is so satisfying when everything flows in the way it does. A software\nfeature, yes, but one that does need responsiveness to pull off well.\nThat isn\u2019t the best test of the powerhouse\nsitting under the bonnet though. In fact, there\ndidn\u2019t seem to be much that would strain the\nquad-core chip. While perhaps not a world-respected benchmark, Angry Birds was as\nsmooth as could be, as was pretty much everything else.\nThe only time I encountered any issues was\nduring web browsing. This was rare, and only\nwith heavily media-based desktop sites (there\u2019s\nan option to always load the desktop version of\na website). It\u2019s probably more likely that this\nwas a by-product of the browser\u2019s rendering\nA Prime tablet specimen\nFELIX\nFriday 10 FEBRUARY 2012\n14\ntechnology.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nTechnology Editors: Chris McBowers\nFeroz Salamander\nTECHNOLOGY\nChris Bowers\nZuckerberg bored; enter Timeline\nTell your life story with a new kind of profile.\nOr so the marketing material goes. The latest\nrevamp of the Facebook profile page has divided opinion among many people and it has not\nbeen embraced by as many people or as widely as Mark Zuckerberg would have wanted.\nThese changes are possibly more far-reaching\nthan any single modification to our favourite\nsocial network in its entire history. Like it or\nnot, they will be made compulsory for everyone within the next month.\nIn case you\u2019ve blocked yourself from online procrastination for the last three months,\nthe Facebook Timeline is a new way of presenting your photos, status updates and all the\nother great things that adorn what is currently\nyour Wall.\nPossibly the first new feature of the Timeline that you\u2019ll notice is the Cover Photo \u2013 a\nbanner which stretches across the top of your\nprofile and dominates what visitors to your\nprofile will see when they first visit it. Profile\npictures have now been relegated to a small\nsquare displayed on the bottom left corner of\nthe Cover Photo, and are still used throughout\nthe site and displayed next to your name in all\nyour posts scattered across your friends\u2019virtual\nlives.\nThere is also an increased amount of cus-tomisation that is given to users \u2013 every time\nsomeone tags you in a photo, or a comment,\nit goes straight to the \u2018Activity Log\u2019. This is a\nbrand new view of all our activity since joining\nFacebook. From here, we can see absolutely\neverything that we have done on the network,\nand it is possible to manually hide things or set\nFacebook to prod you via a notification to get\nyou to approve new posts onto your Timeline\nbefore it shows up. This is a great way to ensure that those embarrassing banterful photos\nof your Sports Night antics don\u2019t end up as a\nbanner on your profile page.\nThe downsides however are numerous, and\nmainly revolve around privacy issues; yet again\na thorny issue which has cropped up throughout Facebook\u2019s history. Firstly, the default privacy options for new Timeline posts are actually set to \u2018Public\u2019, which means that what is\nlikely your entire life will be available for all,\nincluding Google and your potential employers\nto see. In addition you will be dragged kicking\nand screaming to the new format, and you will\nneed to prepare yourself. It is currently possible to conduct a seven-day trial of the new\nTimeline feature where you can purge everything that you don\u2019t want others to see.\nJason Ye\nengine, as opposed to the processor. The rest of\nthe time the browsing was good \u2013 and it even\nsupports Flash, so there are pretty much no\nlimitations on what you can access.\nFor me, the only gripe I had with the tablet\nis the balance of the unit when using it with\nthe dock. It felt as though it could be dislodged\nand fall backwards too easily. While it may not\nbe in the mentality of this light, thin tablet, I\nthink the unit as a whole would benefit if the\ndock had a bit more weight in it, so as to distribute the balance a little better.\nHowever, other people have reported issues\nwith both the wireless and GPS in the tablet.\nAsus have actually confirmed this is an issue with the (pretty) metal back on the tablet.\nThere are rumours that a follow-up with a full\n1080p screen will appear soon, that also fixes\nthese issues \u2013 so if you\u2019re considering buying\nthis, it might be worth waiting for more details.\nAll in all though, I was very impressed with\nthe Transformer Prime. If I were ever to buy\na tablet, it would be one of these, or one of its\nsuccessors.\nFacebook: bringing you a sudden influx of misused memes\n\n"

So\ninstead, I\u2019m going to take the time to wind the\nclock back and review a game I played when I\nwas eleven. It was brilliant then and it\u2019s still a\nmasterpiece today. I\u2019m talking about Cavedog\nEntertainment\u2019s real-time strategy game Total\nAnnihilation.\nTotal Annihilation was a standout game for\nmany reasons, and whilst over 14 years have\npassed since it was originally released in 1997\nit has secured a comfortable place in the hall of\nvideo gaming honours.

For each side, the only\nacceptable outcome is the complete elimination\nof the other.\u201d Very few games since have captured such badassery in less than 35 seconds.\nDespite this basic goal and the game\u2019s brutish title T.A. required more than just grouping\na bunch of units and slinging them across the\nmap. Unlike other RTS games at the time T.A.\nutilized a multitude of different environments,\nrequiring you to plan out your strategies beforehand and scouting ahead to see what fortifications lay ahead. Some planets were large open\nwaterworlds, others filled with lava lakes and\nmeteor storms.\nThe goals too changed level to level. Whilst\nsome did require you to hunt down everything\nin sight others required more tactical planning,\nTotal Annihilation totally\nannihilates boredom\n\u201cThis is a fight to the death.

They don\u2019t take\nit quietly though \u2013 they buzz around, go invisible\nor just plain pelt you with rockets. It\u2019s incredibly\naddicting; in fact, you could go so far as calling it\nsmashing fun (badum-tish).\nFor a Flash game Closure is pretty scary. Well, maybe not that scary, but certainly sinister.\nThe game is built on the basis of orbs of light\nthat, when held, light up the level. Drop it, and\nyou\u2019re just going to fall into the black abyss. You\nhave to manoeuvre your way around the level by manipulating the glowing orbs to create paths to the\nexit door.

The\nrecent bout of weather spelled disaster as the new library entrance\n(costing \u00a37 billion) failed to open\nSaturday afternoon. The door fail-ure, which has since been attributed\nto a simple electronic malfunction,\nleft a contingent of extremely diligent undergraduates and some less\nthan diligent postgraduates to fend\nfor themselves. As the snow fall on\nQueen\u2019s lawn rose to a staggering 3\ninches, the 27 hour ordeal reached\na climatic turn for the worse when\none student sadly passed away after he was unable to receive medical\ntreatment for his caffeine overdose.\nSeveral legions were found on the\nbody, suggesting that other victims\nresorted to feeding off the corpse.\nThe predominantly Chinese group\nof library enthusiasts were finally\nsaved after a relief effort sent by the\nChinese embassy successfully replaced the faulty electronics; using\nsuperior components made in China. After speaking to the survivors,\nHangman discovered that emergency food provisions were extremely\nlow, and highly inadequate.

    "content": "Link\u2019s latest epic escapade\nNot the best, but certainly not the worst. Rhys Davies embarks on Link\u2019s most\nrecent epic, The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword\nS\no I finally completed The Legend of\nZelda: Skyward Sword last night.\nZelda has always been a passion for\nme, even within my geeky realm of\nvideo games. I was blown away by the\nbeauty of Ocarina of Time when I first saw it and\nwith each new game, a new fix for my addiction.\nSo when I heard Skyward Sword was on the way, I\nstarted salivating. Quite Pavlovian. Even more exciting were the reviews I was heard second-hand\nthrough my housemate. The greatest Zelda ever?\nUh, no. Not really.\nIt\u2019s by no means a bad game but it just doesn\u2019t\nhit the high notes I\u2019ve come to expect.\nIn the confusing, timey-wimey in-game history\nof Zelda, this slots in right at the beginning. Link\nquests to prove himself the hero spoken of in legend and to power up the Master Sword, as it is to\nbecome. That second point is remarkably similar\nto the second half of The Wind Waker so already\nit isn\u2019t winning on originality. The Big Bad in\nthis game is Demise, a demon so powerful that\nthe Goddess Hylia lifted humanity into the skies\nand sealed his ass in the ground. However, in the\ngame, after three attempts to leave his seal as The\nImprisoned, he is finally revived by his follower,\nGhirahim. Ghirahim has much more presence\nas the bad guy but even he only shows up a few\ntimes. As a villain, he\u2019s quite fun, mincing camply\nacross the stage, but for the majority of the game,\nthere\u2019s no palpable threat. After the time-skip in\nOcarina of Time, Ganondorf\u2019s presence as the evil\nmaster of Hyrule is absolute (feeding Gorons to\nVolvagia, freezing Lake Hylia, putting Ingo in\ncharge of Lon Lon Ranch, etc.) That darkness visible just isn\u2019t present in Skyward Sword.\nGraphically, it\u2019s quite pretty. Cel-shading makes\na return from The Wind Waker but with a more realistic feel. The forests feel luscious, the volcano\nis sweltering, the sky is so expansive. Nintendo\u2019s\nhallmark is to continue experimenting with their\nfranchises and here it pays off.\nBut it feels small. This is the cardinal sin of Skyward Sword. One of Zelda\u2019s greatest\u2019s strengths\nis the expansive, filled-in worlds. You always feel\nlike there is something going on and everywhere\nis connected. Not in this game. On the surface,\nthere are three designated areas (Forest, Volcano\nand Desert) which you have to visit at least three\ntimes within the main plot. Sometimes, different\n\u201cA rewarding retrospective\nfor experienced Zelda\naficionados and highly\naccessible for anyone\npicking it up for the first\ntime\u201d\n\u201cOne of Zelda\u2019s greatest\nstrengths is is the\nexpansive, filled-in worlds.\nNot in this game\u201d\nArgument no. 34 in the fight against GM technology\nparts become accessible or sometimes, the way to\nhandle the area changes (at one point, the forest\nfloods) but there are still just these areas, which\ncan only be reached from the sky above. And the\nsky! Fairly big, sure, but with no point. There\nare hundreds of little islands dotted about but\napart from Skyloft, where everybody lives, and\nthe one with the pub on it, there is nothing to do\nanywhere. Compare with The Wind Waker which\nhad 49 squares of massive ocean and in each one,\nthere was an island with something to do on it\n(and I\u2019d be lying if all the adventure happened on\nthe islands).\nThe characters, true to Zelda form, are quite personable and full of charm. If only there were more\nof them. My favourite game in the series to date is\nMajora\u2019s Mask for the sheer amount of characters,\neach with their own unfolding and intercrossing\ndramas. With such a small cast, there is only so\nmuch you can do here.\nSkyward Sword was released last year, during\nthe 25th anniversary for Zelda. You can tell. The\ngame works very well as a Zelda retrospective.\nThe weapons have all been seen before, from the\ndouble clawshot (Twilight Princess, a welcome re-turn) to the bellows (Which I\u2019m sure I saw in The\nMinish Cap). Familiar names and faces crop up\ncontinually. The three provinces, and their guardian spirits, share the names (and rough locations)\nwith those of Twilight Princess. There are a few\ngorons about, who evolution seems to bounce off\nlike rubber, and amazingly Beedle. That travelling\nsalesman has some very, very strong genes. Aspects of gameplay also resurfaced, most notably\nthe spirit trials, which Nintendo loved so much in\nTwilight Princess, they\u2019ve apparently lifted them\nwholesale from that game. Another trope I was\npleased to see return was \u201cLet\u2019s put Link in a cannon!\u201d\nA less welcome return is the annoying helper.\nThis time, it comes in the guise of Fi, the spirit\nof the Master Sword. She\u2019s butts in constantly, to\npoint out the most obvious of facts, in an oddly\ntechnical language. \u201cThere is a 60% chance\nthat\u2026\u201d , \u201cI have calculated that\u2026\u201d, \u201cMy records\nindicate\u2026\u201d This is the earliest Zelda game and\nyou\u2019re accompanied by a computer devoid of\npersonality. In fact, after struggling up to the first\ndungeon with her, I saved, turned off, and then\ndidn\u2019t play the game for two weeks. That is how\ngrating she is. (Also, the start of the game is slow.\nPaint-drying slow.)\nHowever, I returned, stuck with it and finally\ncompleted it. I\u2019m glad I did. Nothing about it\nmakes it the best Zelda game ever but it is still a\ngood game. A rewarding retrospective for experienced Zelda aficionados and highly accessible for\nanyone picking it up for the first time.\nGAMES\nFELIX Friday 10 february 2012 31\n\n"

    "content": "SCIENCE\nFELIX Friday 10 February 2012 13\nWall Street Journal denies climate change\nWith the 2012 US election fast ap-proaching, the politicisation of climate\nchange is something that many Americans can look forward to. It would be\nfoolish to assume that US media is also\nimmune from political influence in a\nsystem as pervasive as the USA\u2019s \u2013 most\nmedia corporations fly their blue or red\nflags willingly. One such media outlet\nthat has come under repeated criticism\nfor its editorial board\u2019s willingness to\npublish factually incorrect and misleading opinions about climate change\nscience is the News Corp Wall Street\nJournal, the most widely circulated\nnewspaper in the Western world. On\nJanuary 27, it published a letter from\n16 scientists claiming climate alarmism\nis a ploy by scientists to maintain fund-ing, for governments to raise taxes and\nfor charities to trick people into donating money to them. Paranoid conspira-cy, anyone? They also claimed there is\ndoubt in the scientific community on the\nrelationship between carbon dioxide and\ntemperature, that global temperatures\nhave not increased in the last 10 years\nand that there is disagreement in the climate science community that climate\nchange is even happening (97% do,\nactually, agree). In fact, combined land\nand ocean surface temperature measurements reveal that eight of the warmest\nyears on record have occurred in the last\nten years, with 2005 and 2010 being the\nwarmest ever recorded, 0.64\u00b0C warmer\nthan the 20th Century average (source:\nNOAA).\nIt is important to note that the Wall\nStreet Journal had previously refused\nto publish a comparable but accurate\nletter written by 255 members of the\nUS National Academy of Sciences that\nhighlighted the scientific consensus\nthat humans are having a very serious\nand dangerous impact on our climate,\nLife on Mars? Not likely\nand called for an improved and serious\npublic debate to deal with this problem.\nDespite claims of openness and indepen-dence, it appears as though the editorial\nboard of the Wall Street Journal is rather\neager to fuel the public\u2019s unfounded confusion and doubt about climate science,\nand play them right into the hands of the\nconservative candidates they support.\nIn all fairness, the Wall Street Journal\ndid publish a rebuttal letter in its online\nversion on February 1, penned by 38\neminent climate scientists and experts\nfrom all over the globe, including Sir\nBob Watson, climate change advisor to\nthe UK government, and Chris Rapley,\nformer head of the British Antarctic Survey, who criticised the fact that many of\nthe authors of the previous letter were\nnot climate scientists, and those that\nwere, were known for their extreme\nviews in the climate science community.\nThey likened these outliers to the few\nretrovirus experts that do not except that\nAnnina Sartor explains how an analysis of Martian soil shows it is not suitable for life\nHIV causes AIDS, and the few medical\nexperts who claim smoking does not\ncause cancer. The letter highlighted that\nevery authoritative body of scientists\nin climate science globally have stated\nrepeatedly that the science is clear \u2013 in\nfact, reports commissioned by the US\ncongress concluded unanimously that\nclimate change is happening and that\nit is largely caused by human activity,\nthe same conclusions held by NASA,\nthe Environmental Agency and the US\nDepartments of State, Defence, Agriculture, Energy, and Health.\nThe science is real, the consensus is\nhuge and the concern is massive \u2013 it\nwould be severely foolish for any political leader, American or otherwise, to\ndisregard that evidence and ignore the\ncolossal risk that inaction poses, even\nif it means coming under criticism from\nright-wing media, whose motivations\nmay often not be as clear-cut as they ap-pear...\nModern\nmedicine\nLaurence Pope\nYou might not immediately assume\nDNA sequencing technology and human medicine go hand in hand, but\nyou\u2019d be wrong. Research currently\nbeing carried out by scientists involved in the Human Genome Project is having a huge impact on 21st\ncentury medicine.\nIn a lecture on February 2, organised by the Friends of Imperial College, Imperial Professor Timothy\nAitman talked about human genomics and its influence on 21st century\nmedicine. The professor, currently a\nmember of quango \u2018the Human Genetics Commission\u2019, discussed the\nadvances made in the identification\nof genes involved in both rare and\ncommon genetic disorders, as well\nas a brief history of how geneticists\nhave gotten to where they are today.\nProfessor Aitman claimed that \u201cthe\ntipping point is very close now,\u201d in\nreference to the fact that genome\nsequencing is now so cheap that the\n\u2018thousand-dollar genome\u2019 is likely to\nbe made possible by the end of 2012,\nif not sooner. He spoke only briefly\nabout the ethical issues that surround\ngenetic testing, though with only\nan hour at his disposal the professor was hard-pressed to do anything\nmore than scratch the surface of the\nvast topic.\nProfessor Aitman spoke both enthusiastically and knowledgeably\nover the course of his hour-long talk.\nHe explained otherwise complicated\ntechnologies very succinctly and\npresented information in a clear,\nconcise way that did not leave people\nwith limited biochemical knowledge\nin the dark.\nThough this member of the audience is well acquainted with the\nbiochemical principles underlying\nDNA sequencing and the Human\nGenome Project it was nevertheless\na very engaging talk that prompted\none to think about both the near and\nfar-future. Professor Aitman neatly\nbrought together scientific research\nand its practical applications in personalised drug therapy and preventative medicine.

It can be contacted\nvia www.friendsofimperial.org.uk.\nNASA/JPL-Caltech/University of Arizona/Texas A&M University\nCarys Cook\nW\nhile May 25, 2008\n\u2013 the date of the\nPhoenix lander\u2019s\ndescent onto Mars\u2019\nsurface \u2013 may be a\nday long forgotten for most, the same\ncannot be said of Dr Tom Pike of the\nDepartment of Electrical and Electronic Engineering at Imperial College\nLondon and his team, who, for the last\nthree years, have been analysing data\nprovided by the lander, along with col-leagues. The results of their work were\ndiscussed at a European Space Agency\nmeeting last Tuesday.\nThe team of researchers analysed\nsoil samples using optical and atomic\nforce microscopes, allowing them to\nresolve particles with diameters of as\nlittle as 100 microns. They have since\nbeen diligently cataloguing the particle\nsizes present in the sample. The particles\u2019 make-up and distribution reveals\nkey information about the formation of\nMartian soil and its interaction with liquid water.\nThe researchers searched for clay\nparticles formed by the chemical process of water breaking down rock. No\nevidence of such microscopic particles\nwas found. Even when making the assumption that all particles within the\nsize range comparable to analogous\nparticles in Earth\u2019s soil were clay, these\nwould only make up about 0.1% of\nMartian soil. Comparing this to Earth\u2019s\nsoil, where clay content can be as high\nas 5%, suggests that Mars\u2019 surface has\na very arid history, unfavourable for the\ndevelopment of life.\nThe particle size distribution (PSD)\nof soil being studied can be used to\ndraw conclusions about its exposure to\nliquid water because the proportion of\nclays depends mostly on length of water\nexposure and the conditions thereof. In\nthe case of the samples of Martian soil\nstudied, this analysis revealed that the\nsoil could not have been in contact with\nliquid water for a total of any more than\n5000 years throughout the planet\u2019s 4.6\nbillion years of history. This window\nof time, even when assuming that the\n5000 years occurred in one continuous\nperiod, is too short to reasonably expect\nlife to have formed.\nIn fact, the PSD of Martian soil\nmatches that of the Moon more closely\nthan that of Earth; it shows signs of extreme physical weathering during its\nformation. While on the Moon, which\nis not protected by an atmosphere, this\nis likely due to frequent collisions with\nmeteorites, Martian soil is weathered\nmostly by strong winds, again suggesting a very hostile environment.\nWhile this study examined only samples from Phoenix\u2019s landing site, close\nto the northern polar cap, satellite images suggest that there is little variation\nin the soil\u2019s consistency between different areas of the globe. The same conclusion may thus be drawn for the planet\nas a whole.\nHowever, all hope is not yet lost. Previous research showed that Mars likely\nhad a warmer, wetter period earlier in\nits history. This would have been more\nsuited for the development of life. To\nfind out more, scientists must dig deeper and look beyond the surface \u2013 liter-ally. Life may still be \u201ctaking refuge underground,\u201d Pike says. More research\nis necessary before the idea of life on\nMars can be dismissed entirely.\nDOI:10.1029/2011GL049896\nNASA\u2019s Mars Phoenix Lander on the surface of Mars\n\n"

    "content": "towards services?\nCC: Well the government of course\nwould like to base future economic\ngrowth on science based companies \u2013\nthe famous \u201crebalancing\u201d phrase. Too\nmuch has been tilted towards particularly financial services, and they want\nto put some back. Not into old-style\ndinosaur manufacturing industries, but\ninto the new-style science based com-panies.\nFB: Would you then agree that manufacturing and R&D should carry a\nmore prominent role in the UK econ-omy?\nCC: I think so. Given that we have a\nhighly-skilled, highly-educated workforce and a good science base, and\nexcellent universities like this one producing people who could do this, and\nconsidering companies based on science have a much higher value added\nper-person than others, it makes sense\nto base the future on it, yes.\nFB: On that point, what do you think\nof City firms poaching science graduates away from engineering and high-tech firms? Do you think that the lure\nof the high salaries these have to offer\nis distorting the UK economy?\nCC: I think it was doing so, but that\nnow there is going to be much less of\nthat because City firms are not growing to the same extent \u2013 some of them\nare laying off people. So I think that\u2019s a\nproblem of the last decade; it\u2019s less of a\nproblem for future decades, or this de-cade. But I actually think it hasn\u2019t been\nbad for the whole field because there\nis an uplift: if physicists and engineers\nand mathematicians can get vast salaries in the financial industry, that forces\nother employers, like old-style technological industries such as Rolls-Royce,\nto pay more than they otherwise would.\nI would say that it has been good for\nscience and engineering because it has\nproduced an uplift for salaries through-out, which would be even lower other-wise.\nFB: Concurrent to this change in\neconomic landscape here though,\nthere seems to have been a change in\nthe time-scales associated with invest-ments. Speculative trading is a notorious example of short-termist think-ing, and this is in stark contrast with\nthe returns on R&D expenditure: for\ninstance, the return time on a jet engine is 25 years. How can investment\nin R&D, being so long-term, be encouraged in an environment where\nyou can make money in seconds?\nCC: Well, I would put it a different\nway, because although the trading itself\nis very short-term, remember there\u2019s\nR&D behind that as well. The trading\nalgorithms and so on are not thought up\nin seconds; they take years of underlying research, and scientists who went\ninto the City have contributed to that.\nSo I think it is a mistake to look at everything in financial trading as being\nshort-term, when the underlying strategies have probably been thought up\nover several years \u2013 not as many years\nas a jet engine or a pharmaceutical\nproduct, but they are not as short-term\nas it might seem. In terms of what you\ncan do about it, there\u2019s nothing you can\ndo about it in a capitalist, free-market\neconomy, absolutely nothing. You can\njuggle with the tax system so that, as\nthey do in America, you pay more\ncapital gains tax on an asset you have\nheld for less than a year than for more\nthan a year. You can try and fight short-termism in that way, but fundamentally\nit is just part of the system we live in.\nFB: Do you think the different timescale associated with investments for\na company like Rolls-Royce hampers\nthe way it spreads its finances \u2013 having to set aside large amounts of\ncapital that aren\u2019t going mature for\ndecades?\nCC: I don\u2019t think so. Remember that\nRolls-Royce and the big pharmaceutical\ncompanies have, for the last few years,\nbeen very profitable. I think that there\u2019s\na very good cash flow in these compa-nies; for example in Rolls-Royce\u2019s case\nfrom maintenance, or more importantly\nselling spares for their engines. And the\nwhole thing is geared up for the long-term. They are making money now out\nof investments they made 25 years ago;\nthe cash is coming in.\nFB: Doesn\u2019t that create a barrier for\nnew businesses to start up in those\nkinds of industry?\nCC: Oh yes, it\u2019s a huge barrier. In the\naerospace industry, for example, it\u2019s a\nvery big barrier to starting up, which is\nwhy there haven\u2019t been any successful\nstart-ups in that particular field. At least\nnot in Europe.\nFB: What about the political timeta-ble? Because that\u2019s also quite short-term. Do you think scientific development requires more constancy than it\ngets in terms of government policy?\nCC: Yes, I do. Though there\u2019s more\ncontinuity in government policy, I\nwould say, in science than in many\nother areas. In this country there is not\na big party-political difference: Labour science policy and Conservative\nscience policy are, broadly speaking,\nvery similar. I don\u2019t think there are big\nideological differences. Yes politics\nthinks in the short-term, but it\u2019s not a\ncase where one government will tear up\nwhat the other one has done.\nFB: Would you agree that there is a\nbias against strong scientific policy\ndue to the backgrounds of government ministers, which are overwhelmingly humanities and social\nsciences?\nCC: Yes. And that\u2019s true more generally of politics and the civil service.\nObviously the backgrounds of government ministers reflect the backgrounds\nof members of parliament in this coun-try, and there are far too few MPs with\nany sort of science, medical or engineering backgrounds. The same applies\nto senior civil servants in government\ndepartments \u2013 there are some, but there\naren\u2019t very many. I wish more scientists\nwould go into politics, and non-scientif-ic administration.\nFB: So does talk of revitalising the\nUK\u2019s manufacturing sector require a\ntechnocrat minister \u2013 someone with a\nPhD in some scientific discipline?\nCC: It doesn\u2019t require it. It would probably be helped, but I don\u2019t think we\nshould despair because these people\naren\u2019t around. It\u2019s going to take a gen-eration, if it happens at all, to get more\nscientifically trained people into these\nsenior government leadership jobs. No,\nI don\u2019t think it requires that. It would be\nnice, but not essential.\nReporting Science in\nFinancial Times\nFB: And do you think that the last\nreform for higher education, with so\nmuch of a focus on science and engineering education, will actually produce that shift towards having more\nMPs, senior civil servants, or politicians in general, coming from a scientific backgrounds?\nCC: Yes. It\u2019s going to be a slow pro-cess, but I think it\u2019s part of a general\ntrend \u2013 yes. But it\u2019s clearly going to\ntake decades. I think it\u2019s going in the\nright direction.\nFelix Business Editors Benat Gurrutxaga-Lerma and Nina Kearsey talk to Clive\nCookson, Science Editor at the Financial Times, about the argument for business involvement in science, and about the challenges and changes facing science journalism\nT\no begin, as interviews\ncommonly do, with some\nscene-setting by way of\na weather report, it was a\ncold albeit sunny morning\n(one of those ironies so common to the\nEnglish winter) when we met with the\nFinancial Times\u2019 Clive Cookson to talk\nscience and business. Both a scientist\nand journalist by training, Cookson\u2019s\nwork for the FT has involved writing\neverything from blogs and podcasts\nto teeline shorthand. Thus embodying\nboth the new- and old-schools of jour-nalism, he is well placed to share his\nthoughts on the changing status of science and science reporting. Retreating\nfrom the unremitting cold of the winter\nanticyclone to RCS1, and with coats\nstill drawn around us against its lasting\nchill and the capricious air-con, we began the following conversation.\nFelix Business: The Financial Times\nis a specialist, financially oriented\nnewspaper. Having established itself\nas the friend of \u201cThe Honest Financier and the Respectable Broker\u201d,\nwith a strong focus on business and\neconomics, why does it need a science\neditor?\nClive Cookson: Well, the narrow answer is because so much business is\nscience based. Everything from the\npharmaceuticals and biotech industries\nthrough to materials, chemistry and\nelectronics; computers, IT; all those\nhave, ultimately, a base in science \u2013\nso that\u2019s the answer to why a business\nnewspaper needs a science correspon-dent. But the broader answer is that\nthe FT is not any longer just a business\nnewspaper. We also have Arts sections,\nand we write about science as science:\nI write about cosmology and the origins\nand future of the universe \u2013 that has no\nimmediate business applications. So in\nsummary, a business newspaper would\nneed a science correspondent, but we\nalso cover non-business topics.\nFB: That begins to answer our second question, which was that the general public has this view of science as\nconnected to the manufacturing industry and high-tech companies. But\ndoes it still carry the same relevance\nas the economy shifts from products\nOn Science Journalism\nBUSINESS\nFELIX\nFriday 10 february 2012\n16\nbusiness.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nBusiness Editors: Be\u00f1at Gurrutxaga-Lerma\nNina Kearsey\nFB: We now have some more general\nquestions on science journalism. One\nof the challenges of reporting science,\nit seems, is to avoid being reductionist\nin your efforts to communicate technical information to a non-scientific\naudience; is this necessary, do you\nthink, or should you demand more\nfrom your readers? Does it detract in\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX\nFriday 10 february 2012\n18\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nComment Editors: Tim Arbabzadah\nSam Horti\nCOMMENT\nFELIX\nN\not here, surely? Sexism\nis everywhere: in the\nmedia, in politics, in\nthe arts, but at univer-sities? The centres of\nliberal thought and tolerance? Where\neveryone is open-minded and friendly\nand \u2013 above all \u2013 extremely egalitar-ian? If there were ever a place where\nsexism shouldn\u2019t exist, it is here. And\nyet it persists like an ugly, cunning\nmouse peskily dodging the hungry cat\nof equality.\nIn lectures, (in most of them, in fact)\nI listen to the irritating chorus of male\nvoices in the rows behind me discussing the sexual attractiveness of the\nwomen in the audience. Life for these\nboys (they can hardly be called men) is\nblack and white: the girls are divided\nneatly into fuckable and unfuckable,\nhot and ugly, those who are \u201cfit\u201d and\nthose who are \u201cwastegash\u201d. And all\nof this within earshot of the very same\nwomen they are \u201cclassifying\u201d.\nTo point out a particularly attractive\nperson to a friend is normal; to classify a whole cohort of humans by their\nlooks \u2013 dismissing the majority with\nthe awful term \u201cwastegash\u201d \u2013 is slightly worse than unpleasant. Perhaps these\nboys should be reminded that fourteen\nOxford students were suspended for\nidentical behaviour two years ago.\nIn a slightly less provocative example earlier this year, a mathematics\nprofessor instructed his male students\nto get girlfriends. His hope was that\ntheir newfound loves could write up\ntheir coursework for them, while the\nboys got on with the serious business\nof mathematical study. For most of the\nboys in the lecture this was understood\nto be banter; but for the girls it set up\nan unnecessary divide, ostracising them\nfrom the overwhelming male majority:\nscience is for men, typing is for women.\nBut these are just stupid boys being\nboorish with friends and an old professor out of touch with modern social\nnorms, sexism is to be expected; surely\nwe can find more rounded views from\nthe mature, creative students who write\nfor the student newspaper? But no. Felix, too, has a healthy dose of misogyny\nin its pages.\nYou will, perhaps, remember the satirical character \u201cGurl with Opinions\u201d.\nTo the writer of these dreadful and unfunny articles, girls\u2019 opinions involve\nhow they look, animal welfare, and...\nnothing else. Combining the usual\nstraw-feminist non-arguments (\u201cthis\nguy held a door open for me and I was\nlike, I can open doors, you know!\u201d)\nand typical women-should-care-only-about-looks sexual stereotyping (\u201cdepressed girls just give up on themselves\nand let their hair go all frizzy and start\nwearing baggy jeans\u201d) these columns\nserved no purpose but self-gratifying\nsexism. Hahaha, imagine girls having\nopinions. Hahaha, their opinions are all\nso trivial and unimportant. Hahaha...\nOn top of this, the usually amusing\nHangman regularly leaves the realm of\nhumour to enter the wonderful world\nof misogyny. This year, the infamous\nsection of the paper described successful businesswoman Deborah Meaden\nas \u201ca grumpy bitch\u201d and told her \u201cyou\nsacrifice your entire life\u2026 to the detriment of your children\u2019s happiness, any\nrespect from the male species, and any\nform of femininity (like you had that\nanyway).\u201d\nDiscussing female Imperial students,\nit divided them into those who are \u201cactually pretty fit\u201d and those who could\nbe described as \u201csome dumpy short\nbitch who wouldn\u2019t even get a second\nlook if she went to UCL.\u201d On top of\nthis, three weeks ago Hangman said of\nfemale readers, \u201cGod knows, it\u2019s hard\nthinking down to your level\u201d, and last\nweek said that misogyny was \u201cnot a\nviewpoint [but] a default\u201d. Hopefully I\ndon\u2019t need to explain what is so very\nsexist about these comments. If I were\nfemale, these examples alone would be\nenough to put me off working for the\nnewspaper.\nAdmittedly, Hangman is a section\nthat explicitly aims to be offensive, and\nI wouldn\u2019t begrudge Felix the right to\nprint \u201chumorous\u201d sexist comments if\nthere are people willing to write them.\nBut the fact that there are students who\nwrite these articles \u2013 and who presumably find them funny \u2013 suggests that\nfeminism still has a lot of work to do:\nif some of the most intelligent, open-minded people in the country find sexism and misogyny amusing, what hope\nis there for everyone else?\nAll of this takes place against the\nbackground of what \u2013 for the students\nat least \u2013 defines Imperial: the gender\nratio. Imperial College, the country\u2019s\ntop science and technology university,\nconstantly admits twice as many male\napplicants as female ones. Although\nthis is certainly not a conscious bias\nby admissions tutors, to an outsider it\nimplicitly suggests that, in the world\nof Imperial, men are considered better\nat science and engineering than wom-en. This is clearly something likely to\nmake a potential female applicant decide against applying to the university.\nAll this (you would think) should\nbe fertile ground for a student society\nSexism at Imperial College\nlike Women in Science, Engineering\nand Technology (WSET) to challenge\nperceptions and make a difference.\nAlthough I have great respect for their\nexcellent breast cancer fund-raising ac-tivities, in the area of female empowerment they appear to have done more to\nentrench stereotypes than to challenge\nthem.\nYou may recall a particularly alluring advert for their club night called\n\u201cGirls Girls Girls\u201d described as \u201cImperial\u2019s best looking Metric night\u201d. It was\nset to feature \u201cjugglers, belly dancers,\nand lots of sexy scientists!\u201d and attempted to lure people along with the\npromise that \u201cOur sexy ladies will be\ntaking down your bets throughout the\nnight\u201d. Undoubtedly, the night was just\nintended to be light-hearted fun (what\nbetter way to attract Imperial students\nthan with the promise of girls, girls,\ngirls?), but when the closest thing our\nuniversity has to a feminist society\nseems to encourage the lazy perception\nof women as tools for sexual gratifica-tion, something is clearly wrong.\nObviously, this is not just a problem at Imperial. At least we have not\nreached the level of The Beaver (the\nstudent newspaper of the LSE) whose\neditor faced calls to stand down after\nprinting jokes about rape. Moreover,\nby the standards of the outside world\n\u2013 where sexism pervades every part of\nlife from The Sun to the billboards on\nCromwell Road \u2013 Imperial is positively\nprogressive.\nBut we really need to aim higher. As\nstudents we should be leading the fight\nagainst sexism, not helping to perpetuate discrimination. If you care \u2013 and I\nhope you do \u2013 then read a book, write\nan article, go on a protest, maybe even\nstart the Imperial Feminist Society.\nAnd, most importantly, get angry. Sexism: it\u2019s everywhere and it\u2019s worth getting really fucking annoyed about.\nAre you a\nmulti platinum selling\nrap artist\nand think\nmisogyny is\na way of life?\nWhy not tell\neveryone at:\nfelixonline.\nco.uk\nStephen Smith\nThe poster for the WSET. This means we can charge\nthem for an ad again, right?\nThe stage has been set for a discussion\non the future of both the Holland Club and\nClayponds. Next Thursday (February 16) will\nsee Imperial College\u2019s Graduate Students\u2019\nAssociation host a panel on the potential\nchanges to the status of both the Holland\nClub and Clayponds, both without a doubt\nthe most contentious issues affecting both\nstaff and students at Imperial currently. If\nyou have any interest whatsoever in the ongoing situation, then it is crucial you attend.\nOnline discussion, such as that demonstrated by the \u2018Save the Holland Club\u2019\nFacebook campaign has been notable for\nhighlighting those who have strong feelings\nregarding the situation (not to mention a\ngenuine form of respite from the sudden\nand \u2018dramatic\u2019 influx of \u2018Imperial Memes\u2019),\nand is indeed impressive by the amount of\nsupport that there has been from staff and\nstudents across college. There is only so\nfar that this can go, however. At its heart,\nthe vast majority of those belonging to the\ncampaign group have their own reasoning\nfor the Holland Club remaining unchanged\nby the feasibility study and will ultimately\nvoice their opinion in line with this. The\narena for opposition, for whatever reason,\nis restricted, especially in lieu of actual\nconfirmation by Commercial Services as to\ntheir plans. Until now, opinions have been\nposted on the campaign group, with no official statement being made by Commercial\nServices with respect to any form of new\nlayout, and with Commercial Services informing people that no firm decision has\nbeen made, something that the campaign\ngroup strongly suggests that in their view,\nis false.\nWhere better to instead fully clarify the\nentire situation than with a panel free from\nthe confines of internet debate? This is a\nplace where full and frank discussion can\nbe held between attending parties, and\nwhere individuals can be questioned in the\nflesh, allowing for greater accountability\nand understanding behind the situation.\nSo whether you have concerns about the\nimmediate future of Clayponds or the potential changes to the layout of the Holland\nClub, now is the time to take your points to\nthose who have the power to represent your\nviews and gain a deeper understanding of\nthe entire situation from those who directly at the centre of any potential changes.\nThere is no choice but to attend the meeting and make your voice heard, and to listen\nto all the evidence (or lack thereof) on offer\nin a hope for transparency, rather than alleged truths.\nHave your say on the\nHolland Club and\nClayponds\n\n"

One\nrapid warm-up later, and we were un-derway.\nThe standard was slightly different\nfrom the team we had beaten 15-0\nthe week before. We started slowly,\nwaiting a whole ten minutes before\nthe first goal \u2013 Kirstin lifting the ball\nover the keeper\u2019s stick from a scrappy\nrebound. Teddy secured our second\ngoal, with some great work from Gigi,\nbefore hearts were once again racing\nas Holloway piled on the pressure in\nour defending half. Some strong defence from Ash and Celia soon saw\nthem off, allowing Teddy the chance\nto score our third, grabbing the opportunity after a serious of rebounded\nattempts in the attacking \u2018D\u2019.\nThe second half started with us\nfired up, ready to expand our lead;\nwe had to keep moving to avoid the\never colder conditions, and our confidence didn\u2019t wane. Our continued\nattacks finally bore fruit as Jill, our\ncaptain, fired one past the keeper\nfrom the top of the \u2018D\u2019. Emma and\nMaria in defence with Jess in goal had\na little more to do this half, but Holloway never looked like scoring, and\nwe continued our pressure on their\ndefence. Harry\u2019s work with help from\nNora in midfield soon took our fifth\ngoal, shooting the ball past a static\ndefence.\nThe final whistle couldn\u2019t come\nsoon enough after that, and we piled\nback into the warm of the mini-bus\nback to Imperial for a well-deserved\ndrink.\nJill Tombs\nHockeyWomen\u2019s 1s post another win to\nremain undefeated and go top of BUCS league\nWomen\u2019s 1s 5\nRoyal Holloway 1s 0\nNetball 3s\nprevail in icy\nconditions\nDespite the sub-zero temperatures for this\noutdoor fixture in Chiswick, both teams\ncame out ready for a fight and the match\nstarted off as an end-to-end struggle.\nUWL opened the scoring; a clinical finish\ndespite some sloppy play around the D.\nPredictably, the first IC goal came from\nTsang, followed in quick succession by a\nbeauty from Batchelor - hardly surprising\ngiven the top form both the shooters have\nbeen on this season.\nIC were a constant threat in front of\ngoal and UWL failed to show any resilience \u2013 with the home side unable to produce any game-changing play, IC stormed\nahead in spectacular fashion, closing up\nthe first half comfortably 30-11.\nAs UWL returned after the halftime\nbreak it was clear that their fighting spirit\nhad been entirely consumed by the icy\nconditions.

Can Imperial defend their\nTeam Trophy and complete a hat-trick\nof titles?\nOn this evidence, why not?\nRiding 1st team grab league top spot\nThe first riding team have moved into\nfirst place in their league after an impressive win in Buckinghamshire on\nWednesday. Picking up individual 1st\n3rd and 7th places, Rachel Gregory,\nIlse daly, Sinead Conneely and Mikaela Bryant-Meisner are now in a favourable position with two competitions left, one being their home event\nat Trent Park in Oakwood.\nThe morning got off to a cold start\nwith snow still on the ground at\nSnowball Park when the show jumping started. After 16 rounds on some\nhorses who weren\u2019t so keen on keeping the fences up Imperial college\nhad a 30 point lead, with Gregory and\nDaly holding joint first individually.\nThe dressage horses proved to be\neven more difficult to handle than the\nshowjumpers but the team held their\nown, extending their lead to 49 points\nat the end of the day. Gregory finished\nup with zero penalties to take the\noverall win, an impressive result as\ntoday\u2019s judge noted that this year the\ncompetition showcased some of the\nhighest standard of riding she\u2019s seen\nat University level.\nFor more information about the riding club email riding@ic.ac.uk.\nRiding\nSinead Connelly\nIC Riding\nInsert horse-related joke here\nsport.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nSport Editor: Indy Leclercq\n1 2 3 4 4 5 6 7\n9\n9 11 10\n11 12 13\n13\n13 14 15 16 15 16\n17 16\n17 18 19 18 19 20 21\n22 19 23\n20 21 25 22 23\n24 25 28\n26 30\n10\n12 15\n16 17 18 19 20\n21\n22 23 24 25\n26\n20\n26\n27\n29\n24\n16\n18\n14\n8\n\n"

Some students, particularly current and previous inhabitants of Wilson\nHouse, have stated their belief that the\nhall is in dire need of refurbishment,\nwith particular mention to the kitchens,\nbathrooms and common room, alongside motions to solve central heating\nbreak downs in winter and overheating\nin summer. Students have also concurred regarding the ratio of kitchens\nto bedspaces issue, claiming a lack of\nfridge and freezer space per student and\na number of broken ovens.\nHowever, refurbishment could potentially cause disruption to students.\nAmong the options that have been considered in the case of temporary closure,\nit has been suggested that students could\nbe rehoused in the Elephant & Castle\nor Waterloo area, with representatives\nfrom Imperial College Union having a\nvisit to view accommodation in the area\nscheduled. The College spokesperson\nstated in response to the possibility of a\nmove, \u201cIn the event that Wilson House\nis closed for a period of refurbishment\nthe College will need to find an additional 270 bedspaces to temporarily replace\nthe Wilson House rooms and is looking for other suitable accommodation\noptions to serve this purpose.\u201d Wilson\nHouse\u2019s warden, Dr Bluck comments,\n\u201cShould closure of Wilson be required\n(whenever that may be), other halls\nwould likely be needed temporarily, in\norder to meet the guarantee we make\nto 1st year undergraduates.

It has to be\nnoted that the actors all speak in fluent\nEnglish with varying European accents,\nwhich was really quite annoying, even\nif Knightley\u2019s attempt at a Russian accent was quite impressive. The strength\nof the film, and of Hampton\u2019s script,\nlies in the fact that the film\u2019s two main\nstories, Jung\u2019s friendship with Freud\nand his romance with Spielrein, are totally complementary and each cleverly\nsheds light on the other. By the time the\nfilm leaps forward for a final epilogue\nin 1934, you feel that Cronenberg and\nHampton have succeeded in a full and\nall-too-telling professional and personal\nportrait of Jung, which has drawn you\nin to the end.\nDirector David Cronenberg\nScreenwriters Christopher\nHampton (play), John Kerr (novel)\nCast Viggo Mortensen, Michael\nFassbender, Keira Knightley\nA Dangerous Method\nLucy Wiles\nA bit of an intense film, this one \u2013 a\nvery starkly constructed look at a few\nstrained relationships, most notably\nthat of Carl Jung and Sigmund Freud.\nHaving enrolled a few big names in\nFassbender, Mortensen and Knightley,\nCronenberg does a very good job here,\ndespite this film not being his usual\ncup of tea (his previous works include\nCrash and A History of Violence). A\nDangerous Method is a clear, clever account of the overwrought relationships\nbetween top Swiss psychiatrist Carl\nJung (Fassbender) and his patient \u2013 and\nlater lover \u2013 Sabina Spielrein (Knight-ley) and Jung and his better-known\nAustrian colleague Sigmund Freud\n(Mortensen). The script is very carefully written by Christopher Hampton\n(Atonement, Cheri) based on his criti-cally-acclaimed 2002 play The Talking\nCure, and this combined with Cronenberg\u2019s plain, understated filming makes\nfor a very interesting movie.\nThe story is told over a short timeline\nfrom 1904 to 1913 \u2013 the period in his\nlife when Jung seems to develop most\nas a professional psychiatrist. Though\nsettled with his wife and children in Zurich, he takes on the unsettling case of\na young, beautiful, disturbed Russian,\nSabina Spielrein. Though highly intelli-gent, Spielrein is haunted by a troubled\nfamily past, and there is a strong suggested link between this uneasy history\nand her subsequent distress, and her\nsexual needs and preferences; she has\na desperate desire for sado-masochistic\nsex, and has done from an early age.\nAround the same time, Jung strikes up\nan intellectual relationship with Freud,\nwho is practicing in Vienna. Although\nthe two men share some ideas, they\ndiffer greatly in some aspects, causing\nclashes over cigars and brandy. Alongside this turbulent friendship, Jung\u2019s relationship with Spielrein crosses a very\ndangerous line as the boundary between\npatient and doctor crumbles.\nAs a good introduction to Freud and\nJung\u2019s ideas and their psychoanalytic\nrevolution, the film makes for very good\nviewing. Knightley\u2019s creepy portrayal\nof her character\u2019s wild hysteria and maniacal moments is very convincing - \u201cI\nshould be put away forever,\u201d she spits\n\u2013 and as Spielrein begins to recover and\nYou may be a sex addicted, metal-controlling psychopath \u2013 but I will always love you...\nA film about freeing three Free Willies\nDirector Ken Kwapis\nScreenwriters Jack Amiel, Michael\nBegler, Thomas Rose (novel)\nCast Drew Barrymore, John\nKrasinski\nBig Miracle\nJohn Park\nwas really this tame.\nThat said, the delightful, uplifting\nmoments are an absolute joy to watch.\nThe beautifully designed whales,\nwhich look incredibly realistic, were\nin fact, puppets, controlled by hydraulics and robotic technology. Even the\nsmall, minute details are paid attention to, most notably on the youngest\nwhale that becomes severely injured.\nHis scarring, as well as his weakened\nmovement are captured so well that\nyou would mistake it for being a real-life animal. Barrymore and the highly\nreliable Krasinski make a nice couple,\nwith supporting players Ted Danson,\nDermot Mulroney and Bell all chipping\nin to complete a more than watchable\nensemble. Big Miracle is sweet, often\nfunny and touching: a trifecta needed\nfor every family film to entertain the\nparents as well as the kids.\naround the States, and later the world,\nflock to Alaska in the hopes of getting\na glimpse of the whales. Adam is particularly glad to see Jill Jerard (Kristen\nBell), a talented, ambitious young anchor he has fancied for a long time.\nA rescue mission is put together to\nfree these whales \u2013 a process that does\nnot come about easily. But it\u2019s thanks\nto Greenpeace worker Rachel Kramer\n(Barrymore) who relentlessly goes after\nMayors and Congressmen, that after a\nwhile, her efforts pay off and even The\nWhite House gets involved in the effort.\nIt\u2019s not initially easy trying to get high\npolitical staff interested in a few whales\nstruggling to survive, but Barrymore\nspeaks with humour, heart and convic-tion. Her endless passion on this subject\nmatter may be hard to comprehend at\nfirst, or even particularly like, but the\nactress\u2019 consistent effort mirrors that\nstart off almost straightaway seeing the\npoor three whales trapped under the\nthick ice of Alaska with only a small\nopening providing room for breathing.\nTheir only way to escape is five miles\naway, the kind of distance they cannot\nswim for without coming out of the water to breathe; and because of Alaska\u2019s\nharsh climate, the only air-hole that is\nkeeping them alive is starting to close\nup.\nTheir struggle for survival is unintentionally discovered by Adam Carlson\n(Krasinski), a news anchor dispatched\nto Alaska who is looking to make a\nname for himself despite being in a\nplace that hardly generates any substantial news for the rest of the world to see.\nWhat starts off as a local sensation turns\ninto a national news topic, where even\npeople in sunny California are captivated by the news. Reporters from all\nWhales... gotta love them; and this is\nexactly the kind of emotional response\nBig Miracle is counting on. Even for\nthose who couldn\u2019t care less about\nanimals or the environment, Kwapis\u2019\npleasant enough family picture where\nwe see a group of brave scientists, environmental activists, reporters, native\nAlaskans, and Russians (??), trying to\nrescue three trapped California Grey\nWhales will have enough emotional impact to tug at the heart strings.\nInspired by true events of 1988, we\ndevelop, so does Knightley\u2019s performance \u2013 culminating in a very complex\ncharacter who is displayed beautifully;\na far cry from the film\u2019s opening scene\nof her kicking and screaming as she is\nforcibly carried into a mental hospital.\nThe majority of the scenes between\nFassbender and Mortensen are informa-tion-heavy and very rigorous \u2013 and by\nthat I also mean a little bit wordy \u2013 but\nthey add a few good pieces of meat to\nthe film\u2019s occasionally rattling bones.\nVincent Cassel\u2019s somewhat brief (some-what unnecessary) appearance as the\npsychiatrist Otto Gross is clever, with\nGross acting as the devil whispering in\nJung\u2019s left ear, encouraging him to let\nhis instincts have control and resulting\nin Jung starting up a sado-masochistic\naffair with Spielrein (cue nipples on display and excessive spanking).\nIt cannot be denied that this is a con-of her character, and at some point, she\ndoes win people over. Her performance\nfeels genuine, and it\u2019s with her kind of\nlikability that Big Miracle soars past the\nusual sugary sweet animal drama.\nClearly aimed for families, and therefore children, Big Miracle does not\nhover over the serious aspects of its plot\nfor long. With every difficulty comes an\nimmediate, back-up, almost too convenient answer, without ever exploring to\nmuch depth the more realistic, pessimistic side of events. At times it becomes\ntoo simplistic and refuses to look at the\nbig picture. What about the massive financial cost this must have had? Surely\nnot everyone was up for spending tax\ndollars rescuing some animals? Perhaps\nI\u2019m over-thinking this, but when a film\nmoves this comfortably, without much\nfuss, it is only natural to wonder whether the true events on which this is based\n\n"

    "content": "MUSIC\nmusic.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nThis week\u2019s band have arguably had the most\nmainstream success out of all the bands that will\nfeature in this series and prove that post-hardcore\nmusic, while perhaps a relatively niche genre,\ncomes in various shapes and sizes.\nThe Fall of Troy split recently after their brief but\nfruitful career. They released their first full-length\nalbum when they were just 17-years-old, to vast\nunderground success. This then led to them being\nasked to return to the studio to record their second release Doppelg\u00e4nger and boy did they deliver.\nThis album is a milestone in the history of post-hardcore and rock music in general. I truly can\u2019t\nstress enough how much of a masterpiece this record is, and if you like any type of heavy rock then\nyou have to listen to it at least once. When you\nlisten to Doppelg\u00e4nger, or any of their albums for\nthat matter, you realise that The Fall of Troy don\u2019t\nmess about. On putting the CD into the player,\nyou\u2019re ears are immediately graced with a wailing\ntapping riff from guitarist and singer Thomas Erak\n(who most fans consider something of a deity) and\nthis opening explosion of noise seems to just continue for the duration of the album.\nThe band is known for Erak\u2019s immense guitar\nplaying skill with every lick being something spe-cial, whether it\u2018s a heavy breakdown or intricate\nmath-style piece. For this reason, the band is\nwidely loved by guitar players of all musical prefer-ence. Doppelg\u00e4nger brought The Fall of Troy (rela-tively minor) mainstream success, mainly from the\ntrack \u2018F.C.P.R.E.M.I.X\u2019 which was featured in several video games including Guitar Hero III. Although\nthis track is not one of their best, if you are new to\nhardcore then I would definitely recommend it to\n\u2018break you in\u2019 so to speak.\nTheir subsequent albums saw them drop such\nan aggressive line in the song-writing procedure,\nalthough they continued to show great musical\nskill. If you like your hardcore hard then stick to\nthe older stuff and check out the recommendation below, if not then what the fuck are you doing\nhere anyway you pansyman!? Nah, just kidding,\ntry \u2018F.C.P.R.E.M.I.X\u2019 for something a bit softer and\nremember to come back next week when I\u2019ll be\ncracking into the UK underground scene; it\u2019s going\nto be a good\u2019un!\nWriter\u2019s Recommendation\nListen to \u2018Laces Out, Dan!\u2019 \u2013 a personal favourite\nof mine, although a bit heavier than some of their\nother tracks.\nGeorge Jeffery\u2019s\nA beginner\u2019s guide to\npost-hardcore\nLesson 5: The Fall of Troy\nFELIX Friday 10 February 2012 25\nRoss Gray on Nicolas Jaar at the Roundhouse\nJaar does the rounds\nO\nn Thursday the 3rd of February,\nmy flatmate and I decided to\ntake a risk. We decided to pay\nfor a gig that cost more than\n\u00a315 and wasn\u2019t run by ATP \u2013\na risk we would come to bitterly regret. The\ngig in question was Nicolas Jaar\u2019s Clown\n& Sunset showcase at Roundhouse, a pretty\nlarge venue. As far as we had gathered from all\nof the promotional material, more than just a\nNicolas Jaar show, this was an opportunity for\nhim to showcase the talent from his new label.\nDisappointingly, the gurned up north London\nhipsters, with too much money to piss away\non gigs they seemingly don\u2019t even care about,\napparently didn\u2019t agree.\nSoul Keita, an extremely talented 18-year-old from Ethiopia, was performing his first\never live show. A fantastic blend of minimal\nbeats, jazz and soul samples, and at times\nodd drum patterns and vocal samples was\naccompanied by a massive screen filled with\nmind boggling visuals and quotes from Guy\nDebord\u2019s The Society of the Spectacle. We\nstruggled to listen over the incessant talking\nfrom everybody around us \u2013 there was no way\nto shush as everyone around us was talking.\nNot only did it completely ruin the (as far as\nI could tell) promising performance, I felt it\nwas incredibly disrespectful to a man who has\njust travelled all the way from Ethiopia to give\nhis live debut. We hoped that the actions of the\naudience would be a one-off, but sadly they\nwere a sign of things to come.\nSoul Keita\u2019s brilliant live set was followed\nby one and a half hours of average DJing from\nAcid Pauli. Apparently this was when the\ndrugs kicked in for the rest of the mugs as they\nfelt a DJ set of tracks pretty similar to what\nSoul Keita was doing live was more silence\nand dance-worthy than the interesting live set\nthat had come before. As if a higher power was\njust trying to anger me more, on top of the extreme irritation caused by the idiocy surrounding me, the set was ended with remixes of Radiohead\u2019s \u2018Creep\u2019 and Joy Division\u2019s \u2018Love\nWill Tear us Apart\u2019 songs I found interesting\nwhen I was 11. Obviously these tracks were\nmet with great joy by the rest of the audience.\nEverything implied that the rest of the audience was pumped for an upbeat, dancey set\nfrom Nicolas Jaar. We derided their idiocy,\nassuming that his live set would be similar to\nhis studio work \u2013 quiet, subtle, beautiful \u2013 but\nwe received a slap in the face when it turned\nout the idiots were right. He opened with an\nambient number, which was met by repeated\nwhopping and yelling by the audience. I tried\nto get some sense of respect by shouting \u201cshut\nthe fuck up\u201d at a particularly loud guy, but sadly this just fuelled him on further. Apparently\nbored by the only track bearing much resemblance to Jaar\u2019s studio work, he shouted \u201cdrop\na bassline Nico!! YEAAAAHHHH!!!\u201d I remained silent this time, hoping that Jaar would\ncome through for me and provide a set full of\nminimal beats, subdued piano and hushed vo-cals. He then proceeded to destroy all of my\ndreams by launching a huge beat, destroying\nthe nuance that makes his tracks so different.\nEventually I managed to get into this style\nof presenting his material (although my flat-mate was so sickened he had to move out of\nthe centre to the edges) and did have a good\ntime dancing. I couldn\u2019t help but feel, how-ever, that if I wanted to dance about to some\nthumping 4/4 bass with a bunch of pilled-up\nmorons I could have just gone to a club night,\nwhich these days I try my best to avoid. Luckily, toward the end of the set, and much to the\ndismay of everyone else, Dave Harrington\ncame on and performed the Darkside EP in its\nentirety, with some lovely pedal work on the\nguitar and a little more subtlety to the music.\nWe left during the second encore as it was\nstarting to get a little needy, and generally I appreciate some modesty from artists. Also, one\nhour and forty minutes of being surrounded by\npeople doused in sweat and smashing into me\nconstantly was beginning to get a little tire-some. I would surmise that if you like Nicolas\nJaar\u2019s music for everything that makes it good,\nand wouldn\u2019t say while listening to his albums\n\u201cGOD I wish this had more bass on it\u201d, you\nshould probably never see him live; especially\nnot for \u00a322 a ticket at the Roundhouse.\nGet your foot away from my face\nThe Dublin Castle\nCamden Town\nSaturday 11, Feburary\nKadhim\u2019s totally hot\nalbum of the week\nDjango Django\nDjango Django\nBecause Music\n2012\nI\u2019m bAAAAAck! Terribly sorry about last\nweek; unfortunately my ghostwriter was on\nholiday, so doing my column was a bit trickier than expected. But now that he\u2019s taken his\nleave for the next 12 years, we can continue on\nas normal. Django Django\u2019s Django Django\nis this week\u2019s Totally Hot Album of the Week\n(try saying that while covered in cheese, hanging upside down from a monkey\u2019s uncle). The\n1st class students amongst you may have noticed that, that sentence didn\u2019t make sense; this\nalbum is just as awesomely weird.\nThere comes a point in a lecture, just moments before the end of a long and complex\nderivation, when your higher brain functions\ncollapse. 30 minutes of barely comprehensible\nlecturing lead you to the end of the Yellow\nBrick Road when out of nowhere your brain\nsays, \u201cFuck this\u201d.\nAt those times, you need something differ-ent, something to cleanse the mental palate;\nmaybe something a bit 60s; maybe something\na bit psychedelic rock; maybe something Paul\nSimon-esque? Ahhh, Django Django, you are\nthe perfect cure to a hectic week.\nLike a crisp, chilly lemon sorbet, Django\nDjango isn\u2019t for large-scale consumption. But\nif you feel like heavy weights are pressing into\nyour temples, this album could be your sav-iour.\nIf you feel irreconciably aggrieved by this\ncolumn\u2019s absence last week, tweet me @kad-himshubber and call me \u201ca swine!\u201d Alternatively go post some Imperial-related memes on\nfacebook.com/ImperialMemes\nBe sure not to miss...\nThe White Lions\nDon\u2019t miss this Imperial band\u2019s spirited takeover of the Camden night\nlight. Lying somewhere between\nsleepy psychedelia and alternative\nrock, their songs let shine a gentle\ncrafting of riffery and intimacy.\nHeartthrob vocals colour the\ncrooning instrumentation, bearing\na likeness to British Sea Power.\nReminding of The Durutti Column,\nguitars echo past, wrapping you in a\nfuzzy blanket of distortion while the\nsparse low end sway lulls you along.\n\u00cd\u00f1igo Mart\u00ednez de Rituerto\nMusic Editors: Simon Hunter\nAlex Ramadan\n\u00cd\u00f1igo Mart\u00ednez de Rituerto\nMark England\n\n"
