    "content": "SWALLOW @ CLUB INNOCENCE\nSwallow @ Club Innocence\nShand St., London Bridge\n\u00a38 NUS/\u00a310\n10pm6 am Swallow. A club run by a group of\nyoung people for young people. Having\nrecieved high accolades in both Timeout\nand The Independent, I figured it was\ntime I went down and had checked the\nclub out myself- in the interests of journalism of course.\nSwallow hasn't been running for\nlong, and you could see that this was a night in it's infancy but with huge potential. You walk into the club and can feel\nthe rawness of a night that will soon be\nmassive. The music policy is simple - no\ncheese. A whole host of DJs play hard-house, techno, and hardcore until the\nsmall hours of the morning. And we're\nnot just talking any old DJs, but jocks such\nas Darren Pearce and Nicky Blackmarket.\nSince Swallow has been changing venue\n(due to costs), tonight saw the night at\nClub Innoncence down by fond on Bridge. There were two rooms, a chill out\narea and a connecting room where you\ncould eat all the sweets you wanted.\nThe atmosphere was great, though\nthe crowd was a bit young for my liking\n(but then I'm a fussy bastard). The decor\nincluded drapes all over the place and\nthe lighting created a very dark and\nhaunting dancefloor. After midnight you\ncould see why Swallow will be massive -lots of people, the beer was flowing\nfreely, there were plenty of DJs and\nthere was still six hours to go.\nOne of the great things about Swallow is its music policy and the large number of DJs playing. Each DJ plays for a couple of hours or so and then there's a change as a new jock plays his kind of\ntunes in his own style. This stops you getting bored and creates an atmosphere\nfilled with anticipation.\nThe venue was alright, and as in\nLondon anywhere is better than\nnowhere....so the club was run in some\nrailway arches that had been converted.\nNot too bad, but I 've been to better.\nI 'll take this opportunity to thank\nChris and the Swallow gang for letting us\ncome down and check out what is sure\nto be one of fond on' s premier nights.\nThere will be more Swallow nights\nthroughout this term and Clubscene will\nlet you know all the details as we get\nthem. The next one should be at Mass\nin Brixton.\nGurm\nSingles\nSingle of the Week\nChubby Chunks\n'I'm Tellln You'\n(Cleveland City)\nfantastic single on the Cleveland\nCity label. Originally this was the first\nrelease on the label and was the 'Star-dust' of it's time. The 1999 version features the great vocals of Kim Ruffin.\nThere are two different mixes on the 12\"\nfrom the Prophets of Sound and Dominatrix. The Dominatrix mix is an excellent\nprogressive track with deep beats and\nbass, whilst the Prophets' mix is a more\nfunkier, house version.\nCharles Schillings\n'No Communication'\nA superb track from premier french DJ Charles Schillings (resident at Discobar\n@ Rex Club, Paris). This comes as a double vinyl pack and includes a deep vocal\ncut just oozing with Parisian soul. Salt\nCity Orchestra provide a soulful electro-influenced rework. There is a funked-up\nversion using rolling electric bass and\nfunky organs whilst the final two mixes\nprovide a harder interpretation with\nplenty of pianos and a pumping style ver-sion. Out in May this is French house at\nits very best.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nDemon\n'Lil' Fuck'\n(20000ST) Fantastic single following on from\nDemon's excellent 'Regulate' track. This\nEP brings together three mixes of the ace\ntitled track, one from Etienne De Crecy\nand one from ECube. De Crecy provides a very vocal, deep and funky remix\nwhilst ECube provides a deeper version.\nThe other track on the EP 'My City' provides a seriously rolling groove, mixing\nbongo with funky beats. Something for\nanytime of the day or night. Out on the\n4th May.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nJlml Tenor\nTotal Devastation'\n(Warp)\nMore funky goo ves from the Finn on\nWarp records. This is pumping old skool\nelectro of the highest quality. Produced\nby Jimi himself, the 12\" boasts three\nexcellent mixes, w his lt the CD version\ngives three very different interpretations.\nWith lots of chilled out funky beats and\ngreat vocals each remix stays closely with\nthe original track whilst giving its own\ninterpretation.\nBeat-Boy\nThe Roof Is On Fire'\n(Fresh)\nFucking awful single on the Fresh label.\nThis debut single from a new group Is\nsimply shit. There are plenty of remixes\nwhich (surprise, surprise) all sound\nexactly the same. Cheesy and irritating\nvocals - some of the worst I have ever\nheard - are passed off as 'hip hop, dance\nand 60's psychedelia with a fresh 90's lick'. Quite frankly the single is a load of\nbollocks (something rare from Fresh)\nand you get the impression that the producers and group haven't put in any\neffort at all. Out on the 10th May - and\nwill no doubt be a hit with the teenagers\nof Britain. Cheese!!\n\u2022\nCarl Cox\n'Phuture 2000'\n(Edel)\nTop single from a top jock, Phuture\n2000 is the first single to be released from\nCarl's long awaited new album of the\nsame name. With great pumping break-beats on as pir tiu al sound and deep\nvocals, this is a single being canned on\nRadio 1, with the 'Hybrid' mix being the\nbest of the three mixes. Out now.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nDelirium\n'Silence'\n(Pinnacle)\nThis excellent, deep s pir tiu al, progressive tune will finally get a release in\nthe UK. 'Silence'is one hell of a track. It\nfeatures haunting vocals from folk-pop\nstar Sarah McLachlan and has been hammered by Sasha and Digweed - it has also\nfeatured on their recent Northen Exposure 3 album. The Sanctuary mix is a gem - subtle and soulful. Progressive\nmusic can't get better. Out on Pinnacle\non the 10th May.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nGurm\n\n"

So keen were some of the\ncombatants that a gun was stolen by one miscreant. dB's was bathed in music from\nthe ubiquitous Shaft.

    "content": "20 Sport & Crossword 26 April 1999\nNetball\nSeven Go Mad In Dublin\nDarts\nHolland Club Take Brakespear Title\nEarly on Saturday, 27 March, the seven of\nus (GS: Sally May, GA: Sarah Coburn, WA:\nPaula McGuigan, G Vlkki Revell, WD: Kirstie\nGosland: GD: Rachel Urwin, GK: Alex Haley)\nleft the Union in a somewhat sorry state\nfor our long awaited Netball Tour to Dublin.\nOur heads felt like a quiet coach journey,\nbut unfortunately sharing our coach with\n31 Essex girls was not the ideal remedy for\nour headaches. With the prospect of six\nmatches in two days, the odds on all of us\nreturning alive, injury free and un-hungover were not good. On Saturday night we explored the\npubs and bars in Dublin and an adventurous three investigated a local club and its\nIrish talent well Into the early hours.\nThe first match on Sunday was against\nLiverpool feds, which we lost 14-7 because\nPaula was going to be sick (okay - they\nwent on to win), and then we played Essex\nA and won105. In the evening we went out for Rachel's birthday meal and seriously\nover-ate, becoming far too fat to fit in one taxi and having to take two taxis home again.\nThe next day some of us (Sarah, Vikki,\nRachel and Sally) were up bright and early,\nas Sarah had to umpire the first match. We then went on to play two matches in a row,\nbeating Essex B74and then narrowly losing to Aston 9-7. Impressed by Trinity's sandwich facilities, we were then refuelled with enough energy to play our\nmatch of the tournament versus the hosts - Trinity. Everyone played storm ingly with some quality teamwork and sequences including Sally's cunning \" hop and shoot\" tactics ensuring a resounding\n10-8 victory (IC scoring 2 5 % more goals\nthan trinity as Alex rightly pointed out). By\nthe way, Alex finally woke up on Monday to give it her all against an annoyingly\ngood GS in the final match. It was a close\nfought affair with us eventually losing to\nUniversity College Dublin 8-7, leaving us 3rd overall.\nHighlights included Paula's displays\nof gymnastic tumbling both on and off\ncourt, once sprawling into the Trinity team\nwho were watching from the sidelines.\nSarah and Vikki perfected their own text\nbook version of the IC centre pass, where the ball travelled from the centre circle to\nthe goal in 4 moves completely ignoring\nthe rest of the team. The mystery of \"that\npink stain\" on Rachel's air tex was finally\nsolved on the last day when it was identified as Sarah's blackcurrant drink. However,\nwe all became slightly concerned about\nPaula's growing ability to pass to imaginary\n12-foot tall people standing 20 miles\nbehind other team members. Delusion or\nalcohol? We suspect the latter.\nAll in all we had a fantastic tour and Sally tried on every pair of black trousers in\nDublin. Special thanks go to Sarah Coburn\nfor umpiring numerous other matches on the tour. Remember girls, \"What goes on tour, stays on tour!\" (Essex Netball Squad,\n1999).\nTowards the end of last term the inaugural season of the Imperial _ . --i( ill ' ! !,.| IS |i...!(I. to its thrilling climax, but dui\nto o the i glorious achi evi ment s we were slightly over I looked.

A double CD with\nwell over two hours of music, this album features the mixing talents of two great\nDJs, Anthony Pappa and Rennie Pilgrem.\nDisc 1 (recorded live In Australia) is the\ndeep, spiritual progressive sound that\nRenaissance is legendary for. Starting\nwith the wonderful opening tune 'Water\nRide' by 16B, the music slowly builds up to more progressive tunes with deep beats. Tracks include Hu mate's 'Love\nStimulation' and Hybrid's 'Kill City'. The\nsecond CD is a more funkier sound mixed by Pilgrem and encompasses funk\nand breakbeat tunes - some of them fast flowing whilst others are chilled.\nThis is an excellent compilation, but then\nyou'd expect that from Renaissance. Out now.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nBang Bang\n'JeTAImeJeTAIme'\n(East West Records)\nIt's been out for a little while now but\nthis is a superb french house album. The brainchild of Xavier Jam aux, the\nalbum is funky, soulful, house and folk\nall rolled into one. Xavier builds the foundation for his tr c aks with his vast\narray of vintage keyboards and adds his\nown drums, bass and samples. Inspired\nby the music of the 70's, he also fuses together folk and soul. Add to this some wonderful vocals, and the result is a top\nalbum, which you will end up listening\nto time and time again.

This is a double CD\nalbum and is a live recording of Oakenfold at Cream playing the kind of tracks\nwhich have made him the top jock in the\nworld. There are nearly thirty tracks over\ntwo CDs and I guess if you like Cream/\nOak ie then it'sw or ht checking out, but\nthis album is really a case of Cream milking as much as they can and it's nothing special. The booklet you get with the CD is amazing probably the worst booklet\nI have ever seen and full of crappy facts\nsuch as the total n uber of beats used in\nOakie's sets at Cream over the last two\nyears! Out now.\nSound of Eukatech II\n(Compilation)\n(Eukatech)\nA great double CD album with over\ntwo hours of cutting edge underground house and techno club tracks. The\nalbum represents the music which is\nreleased on the Eukatech label and which is sold in the Eukatcch record\nshop.

Out in May.\nPills\n'Electrocalne'\nfelix's French connection continues with this top-quality French tech-house album. I using house, funk,\ntechno and tech-house, the CD starts\noff at a hectic pace and stays there all\nthroughout. The tracks use guitar licks,\na303, shredded vocal chants, acid bass\nlines nad beak beat loops with a hint of\npop. It's a great album which you don't get sick of listening to.

Their latest\nalbum is 'Solid Silver' and is an excellent\nalbum of the best progressive house tracks currently doing the business in\nthe clubs. If you need to compare it to\nsomething then try an Oak enfold album great deep tracks which you could spend ages listening to. Tracks include\nThe Band' by Marco/ a ffa rano, 'Rhthym\nClimber' by PVZ and the excellent 'The\nJourney1\nby Sadie Glutz. The list of remix-ers is also impressive and includes Way\nOut West and Paul Van Dyk.

This is a great single with mixes from Paul Van Dyk and from Mijk Van Dijk (I wonder if Dick Van\nDyk will do one?). The PVD remix is a powerful progressive track with lots of\ndeep beats, instrumentals, and pianos,\nwhilst the MVD remix is morehouse sounding but very weird.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nAlso being released is the 1999 remix\nof 'Lust' by Velocity. This is a good progressive tune with deep beats and bass\nbut has a very catchy tune to it. The single features remixes from Slander, LSG,\nand aG Watt remix. The Slander remix\nisn't too bad, following the original quite\nclosely. The G Watt mix is crap but the\nbest of the lot is the LSG remix which is\na fantastic jour en y through prog, house.\nLust' is out now.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nThere will be more info, about the Silver Planet Recordings label later this\nterm.\nSilver Planet Records Special by Gurm\n\n"

Not only did he write this production but he also directed and starred in it - and what a fantastic job he has done. Understandably, this film is an adult-only comedy as the plot revolves around the making of a porno. If the mention of a porno has grabbed your\nattention then you will be disappointed, as this is more of a parody than the actual thing.\nThe main star is Joe Young,( played\nby Parker) a struggling Mormon from Utah who is in LA preaching the Good News. He is engaged to be married and is having problems getting the money together to marry his beloved in\nthe Temple in Salt Lake City, until that\nis, he stumbles upon these to fOr gaz mo an adult movie. Max Orbison who instantly casts our innocent friend\nas the leading man. Captain Or gaz mo, is shooting the porno. Or gaz mo becomes an over-night success and Parker reluctantly finds himself in the spotlight when the film becomes a box-1\nTrey Parker.- A master of subtle adult humour.\noffice hit. Although the film represents\neverything that his beliefs are against,\nhe carries on being Captain Or gaz mo. from the non, it gets silly, with a Chin ese 'home-boy', hamster style martial\narts and many cheesy special effects.\nEventhough this film is a cross\nbetween Power Rangers, a Jackie Chan film and Boogie Nights, it has all the making s of a cult classic, as it is so orig-in al. Parker directs Orgazmo in a freshly\ninteresting style and he also shows great promise as a script writer too. Most of the people in this film have no acting ability at all apart from Parker and a few select others but this just makes the film funnier. Q Helen\nWin tickets to Plunkett & Macleane with\nKENSINGTON\nAttempting to unite the success of Lock\nStock & Two Smoking Barrels with the classic British costume drama, Plunkett &\nMacleane is a non-stop rollercoaster of stylised action and romance. It's directed by Jake \" son of Ridley\"\nScott and stars Robert Carlyle and Jonny\nLee Miller as a pair of ultra-cool eighteenth century highwaymen and Liv Tyler\nas the obligatory be-corset ted love inter-est. It's far from serious - slow-motion,\nfireworks and dry ice can be found in\nabundance so expect cheese, and expect a lot of it.\nIf you' d like to see the movie for\nfree, then we' ve got ten pairs of tickets\nto give away thanks to those ever-reliable\nfolks at the Odeon Kensington( you know where it is). So, for your chance to\nJ ii lili. I|; win, simply answer the following ques-tion:\nIn which movie, due out later this year.\nIs Robert Carlyle lined up to play a bad-die named Renard alongside Denise Richards and John Cleese?\nEmail your answers to fl lm. felix@ic.ac.uk\nbefore Wednesday evening to be in with\na chance of winning. The first ten names out of the virtual hat will win a pair of tick-ets.\nWell done to the winners of last\nterm's Waking Ned competition, who all correctly spotted that full Monty star\nTom Wilkinson and Four Weddings and\na funeral slat Hugh Grant collaborated\non Sense and Sensibility\n17\nVID fc jJ f iiAl Ii IPDATE\nThe Exorcist\nBy finally getting a video release, The\nExorcist is bound to receive a massive\namount of media coverage. Sadly, how-ever, those who go out and rent it in the\nexpectation of a horrific, gory Satan fest\nwill be sorely disappointed. Twenty-Six\nyears after its first tour of the cinemas, the\ngoal-posts have moved to such an extent\nthat a nation of seasoned c in cma goers won't even find The Exorcist particularly\nfrightening.\nNonetheless, it remains a brilliant\n(and fairly nasty) thriller, taught and claus-tro phobic in its execution, that fully\ndeserves the 'classic' tag which it so frequently receives.\nA Perfect\nMurder\nArtistically, the virtue of remaking Hitchcock 90's sty lc with Gwyn c th Paltrow and Michael Douglas in the leading roles may\nbe dubious, but from a monetary point\nof view it's got profit written all over it.\nThe directors of re-makes like this\nalways talk about broadening a movie's appeal, and in this case it's probably true.\nAdmittedly it's not as good as the orig i nal, but the quality of the plot, alongside\nDouglas' ham my but-enjoyable evil\nschtick and some nifty camera work make\nfor a decent night-in nonetheless.\nvelvet\nGoldmine\nOh dear. Once again tw an McGregor proves that just because his name is\nat tat ched to a movie, it's no guarantee of\nquality. Indeed, for every decent movie\nhe's been in, you'll probably find at least\none suck-lost. Worse still, by following-up\nhis role in The Avengers with a supporting performance here, Eddie Izzard is\nhardly making the best of his fledgling\nacting career.\nEssentially, however, it's director\nTodd I layne s who must shoulder the\nblame, rather than his stars. He deliberately sets out to make a movie so devoted to frenzied 70's retro styling that\nhe ignores plot or character is ation which\nleaves two hours of painful glam-rock\ncostumes, and precious little else.\nDave\n\n"

    "content": "26 April 1999 Arts\nKANDINSKY - WATERCOLOURS,\nAND OTHER WORKS ON PAPER\nRoyal Academy of Arts\nVasily Kandinsky (1866 - 1944)\nundoubtedly exerted a profound influence on modern art. Surprisingly\nenough, this pioneer of the abstract style\nwas something of a mature prodigy. He\nabandoned an auspicious career in law at\nthe age of 29, inspired by the revelation of\na Haystack by Monet, which \"impressed\nitself in era dic ably upon[ his] memory, always hovering before [his] eyes\". Besides\nbeing gifted with a photographic memory, Kandinsky was syn aes the sic distinct\nshades of colours stimulated powerful\nsounds and sensations in his brain.\nThe substantial collection\nof prints, sketches, watercolours and gouache s provides\na comprehensive overview of\nKandinsky's innovative artistic\nevolution throughout the 20th century. Initially influenced by Russian fairytales and religious icons, the subject matter gradually evolved towards intrinsically\ngeometric, non-figurative compositions.\nAlthough folkloric motifs of his homeland\nsubsequently emerge In his work such as\nThe Great Gate of Kiev (pictured right),\nKandinsky is renowned for his vivid, nonobjective pieces - Off Balance for instance,\npictured left. Kandinsky also developed and\napplied a scientific, theoretical basis to his\ntechnique, which revolutionised the Expressionist movement. Disillusioned by the political turbulence in communist Russia, he\nemigrated to Germany where he lectured\nat the Bauhaus institute and was involved\nin the compilation of The Blue Rider (Der\nBlaue Reiter) almanac.\nThe most fascinating element of the\nexhibition was the inclusion of a video,\nshowing the artist at work. Within a matter\nof minutes, a blank page was covered in\ndynamic swirls and grids, revealing his spontaneous and swi ff approach to art. His paintings literally came to life.\nHelena\nUntil 4th July\nAdmission: \u00a36, students \u00a34\nOpening hours: daily 1 0 am6 pm( Fri-days in April and May until 8.30pm) Nearest tube: Green Park\nIMPERIAL COLLEGE CHOIR AND\nTHE IMPERIAL MEDICS CHOIR\nVerdi Requiem\nTaking my seat in the Great Hall on Friday 19 March, I noted that there\nwere almost as many places for the performers as for the audience. This was encouraging because Verdi's Requiem is\na big work requiring what might be colloquially termed 'large portions'. A German conductor of the day dubbed it\nVerdi's 'latest opera dressed in ecclesiastical robes' for its dramatic and s ecu lar style. It evokes a series of contrasting\nemotions, sometimes powerfully, some times with the utmost delicacy. It is a string of fixating, breathtaking passages\ninterspersed with less intense sections to allow the audience to refill their lungs\nand release their grip on their armrests.\nThe auditorium prickled with anticipation as the singers filed in - the event\nhad clearly attracted an enthusiastic crowd. There were the occasional bursts\nof partisan applause as a small group spotted their chum on stage, even the odd aborted Mexican wave. The conductor, Therees Tkach Hibbard, entered\nwith the soloists to a ripple of expectant\napplause and everyone settled for the opening chords.\nThe first section is like the lull before\nthe storm. The captivating sound of chorus and muted strings woos the audience\nto calm before being shaken awake by\nthe sudden outburst of orchestral might\nwhich introduces the Dies Irae, the loud-est, longest and probably most famous section of the piece. I was almost blown out of my chair by the blast of brass, the\nscream of sopranos and the boom of the\nbass drum, played by an individual who emulated the heartiest of baseball sluggers in style and power. The relentless\nruns of strings fill one's head with\nthoughts of apocalyptic doom and divine.\nwrath. The 'dread trumpet' calling the dead to rise came in the form of powerful off stage brass playing a fanfare that\nfilled the hall with awe-inspiring noise. Ms Tkach Hibbard hopped about on her\nconducting stand regimenting her\ncohorts, keeping the singers' perform ance tight and intense. The lilting linking sections of duets and orchestral\nplaying allowed on elo breathe out before the next onslaught of over-w hel ming oratorical power.\nThe Requiem is a piece of intense\ncontrasts. The soloists have a real chance\nto shine in their sections. The buxom Miranda Keys (soprano) and Kathryn\nTurpin ( mezzo soprano, standing in for\nthe unwell Louise Mott) carried off the lilting Agnus Dei beautifully, especially considering the lack of rehearsal time. The\nphrases lilted and lingered on the ears in\na smooth relaxing fashion. James Rutherford (bass) and Simon Bainbridge (tenor)\nwere at times menacing and at others\ndeeply sombre. What really stood out\nhowever, was the dynamic control and precision of the chorus. They performed out of their skins not only in the loud sections but also in the more delicate pas-sages.\nMiranda Keys sang the final phrases\nwith such wonderful dulcet intensity that\nthe audience was stunned to along silence before the well deserved rapturous applause erupted. Thank you to the\nchoirs, the orchestra, the soloists and their conductor for a superb night's entertainment.\nlain\n\n"

The fact\nthat I don't keep a dog, poor or otherwise, as a pet doesn't enter into it. Canine non possession impacts\nnot upon the bareness of one's cup boards, and mine certainly were bare.\nEventually, having eaten all seven of the halves of onions that inexplicably accumulate in even the best run of fridges, and when I could no longer stomach yet another meal of Bisto and corn flour fritters followed by ice cubes a la Thames Water, I reluctantly had to admit that the time had come to dig out my Lit tlc woods duffel coat ( one of those 'just too good to miss' bargains that you' re always hearing about) and t rog off to the supermarket to bend my\nknee at the altar rail of20 th century consumerism. I always feel the tiniest bit guilty\nabout making such hard work of going shopping. I mean it's only\njust down the road, a fifteen minute walk at the\nvery most. It's not like I have to trek for hours,\nbarefoot under the mid day sun clad only in a loincloth, sucking groundwater up through hollow reeds in\norder not to die of thirst, following the\nalmost imperceptibly faint tracks of my\nprey which I will have to bring down using a David-and-Goliath-ty pc stone in\na sling. Nor doI have to head off for a three day trip into dense subtropical rainforest armed with a spear and a catapult,\nsearching for arma dil los or something equally scaly and u nap pet ising to knock senseless and turn into a casserole. Compared to the lengths to which some people have to go to in order to fulfil\ntheir most basic dietary requirements,\nmy life is simplicity itself. On the other\nhand, Kalahari Bushmen rarely have to contend with an irate pensioner who, having taken ticket number47 at the deli counter, wandered off to get a bottle of Camp coffee and then returned fifteen minutes later, to find that the ' Now Serving' number has moved on to 62 and he has lost his place in the queue. Likewise I'm willing to bet that instances of\nAmazonian Indians getting stressed out\nbecause the only trolley left is the one with the wheel brake stuck on are very\nrare indeed. This being said, Iam still of the op in ion that all in all I 've probably got the better deal. One thing for sure.\n\"...I have never\nbeen able to under\nstand why age\nshould be a guarantee of quality...\"\nsupermarkets have got a lot more complicated since I used to sit in the little seat at the front of the aforementioned motion impaired trolley. Back\nthen, shopping was shopping, and not a' nourishment acquisition leisure experience', and an in-store\nbakery was something that happened a cci den tally when the heating got stuck on full in the middle of summer. Another thing evident to\nthose of us whore mem ber when things were priced to the nearest half\npence, is the veritable\nexplosion in the range\nof vegetables now available to the discerning consumer. To be\nabsolutely frank, some of the greenery\ncurrently masquerading as\nfood at your local fresh ve g counter scares the life out\nof me. No t only does some of it look like the222' nl,dir, ury rv v*.i*z>' \u2022 ~ on the planets visited by\nthe people off of \"Space 1999\",\nbut I can't pronounce the names of half\nof them, let alone tell which bits to boil\nand which to cut off and throw away.\nThe humble King Edward and deeply un glamorous Brussels Sprout have been forced into a shotgun marriage with Pak\nChoi and Khol Rabi, the long-term con sequences of which can\nonly be guessed at. It's the same with fruit. In\nthe days when all of the\nbubbles in carb on a ted drink\nhad to\"p a; their fizz i cool the big ges choice faced b> the shopper was between Granny Smith's or Cox's Orange Pippin, and the purchase of such exotic a as a box of dates with a picture of a camel on the lid, or\na pineapple, meant either\nthat Christmas was just\naround the corner or that you had a relative in hospital. Not\nany more. Pomegranates sit\nalongside Starfruit which are\nthemselves cheek by t owl with ft Lychees, or some similar pro- HP P \u00ab\nduce, whose only previous appearance in Britain up until recently\nwas In the Ape house at Regent's Park\n2 oo. Please don't misunderstand me.I' m \"Back then, shopping was shop-ping, and not a 'nourishment\nacquisition leisure\nexperience'...\"\nnot saying that all this new-Matt Salter found choice in green grocery and the ability of the\nconsumer to now buy gristly Continental\nsausages that are so full of fat that they\nonly differ from candles in that the latter\nhas a wick, is necessarily a bad thing. The\nemergence of stores\nthat are bigger than Noah's ark and contain\na greater variety of meat and poultry, must\nbe a good thing from the cultural-barrier-breaking, horizon broadening, consciousness-raising\npoint of view. Not only\ncan you now get comestibles, toiletries,\nmagazines, jeans, spares for your car\nand wing mounted air-to-ground missile\nracks for an F16 under one roof, but the traditionally\nun adventurous and nutrient\nbereft British diet might also\ntake a turn for the better -you never know. In awa w j \u00a3\nI hope that the standard of 1|\nfood in this country does1 improve if only so that our\nsmug European cousins will no longer be\nable to lord it over us in matters culinary.\nOne particularly welcome develop ment is the near exponential improvement in the ready-meal market, to the\npoint where heat-up curries actually look\nlike curries and not a slurry of post-surgical\noffal and industrial effluent dribbled over semi-cooked UNHCR-reject\nrice, as they did in the b days when Vesta had\n: monopoly. A sars y, thrusting young dentist with little\ntime and even less\ninclination to wield pots and pans,\nmy shopping basket often i includes a few items from the cook-chill cabinet, and I placed\na couple of600 g Tagliatelli\nCara bonar a and a Chicken Kor ma in my trolley. They\njoined a selection of packets\nand tins and a motley collection\nof exotic fruit and ve g, which I had chosen in a effort to appear cool and hip when unloading my shopping at the\ntill. Next came a jar of Italian\npasta sauce \" made to a300 year old traditional recipe\". I have never been able\nto understand why age should be a guar-an tee of quality, as implied by the label\non the jar which I had just placed into my\ntrolley. I have often wondered whether for the last three centuries Italian hus-bands haven't been eating spag bol made with this sauce with a grimace\nand saying \"Whatta the hell is s a this? It\ntastes lika shit\" under their breaths. Foll owing this was a pot of deluxe super-thick-stand-your-spoon-up-in-it yoghurt -the culinary equivalent of Russian\nRoulette and one that comes with a 'noticeable hardening of arteries or your\nmoney back' guarantee. A visit to the\nmeat counter showed that the inflationary expansion had been extended to\nthis part of the store as well. Now, as well\nas chicken and pork one could purchase\nostrich, alligator and kangaroo. I toyed\nwith the idea of buying some venison\nbut it was a bit deer. The bread counter\nsaw me getting my hands on a crusty cob\nand a packet of American-style donuts\nwhich I didn't really want but which had an extra 25 Advantage\nPoints on them. Then I steered my laden trolley\ntowards the tills, resisting\nthe temptation of the 3 for 2\nCastrol GTX offer. I had purchased so many things\nthat I couldn't make use of the \"eight\nitems or grammatically incorrect\" Express\nCheckout and I was forced to wait while\nthe customer in front, whose shopping seemed to consist entirely of items either\nhaving no price or an unreadable bar-code, slowly packed his things away in\nabout seventeen separate bags and paid with\nthe takings of his Penny\nArcade, before I could\nhave the cost of all my\nnew possessions totted\nup. There then fol-lowed the usual fiasco\nof paying for the stuff,\nwhereby the cashier\ndoes their level best to\nshove the contents of my shopping trolley down the conveyor belt and into the\nholding area at the end faster than I can\nstuff them into the ludicrously flimsy,\npre-ripped polythene bags provided, in\nsome grim and manic imitation of that bit\nwith the cuddly toy at the end of the Generation Game. I left the shop, sweating\nprofusely and with the vein in my tem ple pulsating uncontrollably.\nThere's no disguising it -1 hate doing the weekly shop. But at least it's over for\nanother seven days. With a full larder my\nfood life will be much improved, for a while at least. It's quite a comforting feel-ing, only... oh damn I forgot to buy toilet rolls. And Brillo pads, and coffee...\nand, ...oh for goodness sake...\n\"The emergence\nof stores that are\ns ger than Noah's ark must be a good thing...\"\n\n"

Well\nthe future's bright, the future's orange for\nWar zone2100. Once again a rogue Al has triggered\na nuclear exchange, bringing the end of\nthe world as we know it. As the com mander of one of the groups of survivors your task is to attempt to bring\nback a little bit of that olde world charm by finding the remnants of pre-war technology before the opposition. Did I forget to mention that your group was not\nthe only bunch of survivors? Out in the\ndesert, in the cities, and in the mountains\nthere are other less friendly groups who also want the technologies\nand arc more than willing\nto force the point with a few well placed bullets.\nOn your side is a few trucks and a handful of armoured cars. Not the most impressive of peacekeeping forces, but give\nthe trucks enough time to\nbuild factories and you have your own personal production line. Make the\ntrucks build research labs\nand any remnants picked up along the\nway give you improvements such as\ntracked vehicles, new weapons, even\nnew bits to put on vehicles - like cup holders.\nOne of the best features is the design screen from where you can piece1 together random bits and bobs, to\ndesign incredibly\nfast scout cars or\nbig, bulky can non wielding battle tanks - or if\nyou are odd, slow bulky scouts\nand small fast\nand fragile tanks.\nLater on you get\nhovercraft and v TO L aircraft added to the\narsenal.\nHaving so many\noptions available\nthe game could have been a real\nnightmare to control but the simple\ncontrol interface allows you to fight,\nresearch, command and build without\nneeding to use twenty keys at once. The\ncommand interface for instance allows\nyou to direct a group to fire from various\nranges, change their state of alert or\neven cease fire all within seconds.\nThe graphics take the best graphics\nfrom this genre and notch it up several\nlevels. Not only can you change the viewing direction, but\nalso the ele-v ation. It's better looking than the\nview from a LI 6 cockpit,\nand twice as\nclear.\nSo apart from the story what can Imo an about? Occasionally the Al decides\nthat your forces would much prefer to\ntake on the enemy camp straight on rather than following the safer route\nround the back, but the Al both of your\nand the enemy' s forces arc still a complete leap ahead of earlier games. There\nis even a command to withdraw forces\nafter suffering damage, which can save\neven the most stupid of generals and is\nalso used by the computer forces to preserve its limited forces. Lor once here is\na game where engaging in battles of attrition will fail, yet limited sacrifices are\nalso not heavily penal is ed. With the addition of a multiplayer option it rolls over\nthe opposition and crushes them without\nmercy. For those without exams prepare\nto lose sleep, for those with exams I take no responsibility for the results.\nGary S. Commandos - Beyond the Call of Duty (PC)\nThis game is hard, very very hard. After\nseveral hours of effort on the easiest\nlevel, I managed to sneak my little group\nof World War 2 hardened killers, snipers\nand explosives experts through the island\nfortress planting explosives and removing\nthe odd German guard that had looked at me in a strange way.\nI got to the extraction beach, blew\nthe charges and readied the rubber raft\nto escape the island. It was then Is aw the\nminefield just off the beach, discovered\nthe island was crawling with guards and that I needed to go back and finish off a few of the Anti-aircraft gun positions.\nTime to reload and try again.\nfor those that missed\nthe original commandos, the game features the\nactions of a group of very\nspecial specialists who take\nthe very nastiest and dirtiest\nmissions. It is your job to\nguide them from a distance\nand prevent them being captured, shot and being detected, while completing\nthe mission in the shortest\npossible time.\nHint number one : It\nmight appear to be smart to massacre the\nwhole garrison but It is usually not advisable to start an open war while you are\noutnumbered and your weapon of\nchoice Is a sharp knife.\nThus running in and shooting off your pistols arc not the smartest of Ideas,\nbut crawling up to people and shooting them in the back with a harpoon gun or\nsniper rifle is. Unfortunately while a dead\nguard can not call his friends, his friends\ntend to get a bit jumpy and will hit the\npanic alert button if they see their buddy\nwith a harpoon in his back. Removing\nbodies from view becomes a big and messy task.\nThe graphics are detailed in the\nextreme - the lapping of the sea on walls\nand beaches on the first level, the seagulls floating by, and the buildings them selves all create the impression you are\nin a commandos movie. It is not just a pretty picture though. There is the ability\nto zoom in and out, and create several\nwindows to monitor more than one area\nat once.\nThe sound, while not being perfect,\ndoes go towards completing the impression of a movie, with various stereotypical accents taking the voices of the different characters - the big hard guy is\nasco user, and the sniper a cool sophisticated upper class gent. The\nother sounds are just aver-age, but in a game where brain and appropriate action\narc the rule you would no l expect a loud and explosive\nsoundtrack, the gentle rush\nof the sea on the beach and the quiet snap of a silenced\nrifle are about as urgent as\nyou get.\nWhile the game is\ngraphically pretty, has gameplay in abundance and has\na very easy and well thought out control\nmethod, it is horrendously difficult even\non the easiest level. It is this reason and this alone that will put off all except the\nmost committed of commandos and strategy fans, lor the average gam c play cr the game loses some of its appeal and gets bogged down in the constant saves\nand reloads needed to be able to finish\na situation that you had thought was complete, but had just become a big\ndead end. It is a very good game spoilt\npurely by its difficulty - definitely one for\nthe strategy guys but will not impress\nthe action fanatics.\nGary S. "

Felix. Besides, term has\nbarely started and the few news writers we do have are still revising in far\nflung corners of the globe. Anyway, I believe that we all have a conscience,\nand not even impoverished students\nare exempt from this. \"Why is he hung\nup on this humanitarian crisis, while\nsuccessfully ignoring famine in Africa\nand oppressive regimes in Asia and\nLatin America?\" I hear you ask. The\nbrutally honest answer is that it is a lot\nharder to make a real difference in\nplaces like Sudan. Aid agencies can\ndo their best, but at the end of the\nday a change of attitude is needed as\nmuch as money. In Kosovo, however,\na large injection of cash could make\nall the difference in the coming weeks\n- for many, the difference between\nlife and death.\nEnough propaganda - what about\nthe politics? Well, I'm staying out of\nthem. I am aware that we have representatives from many nationalities\nat Imperial, and don't want to obscure\nthe humanitarian problem by opening\na political can of worms, for the purposes of this rant and this newspaper,\nI don't care if you blame the Serbs,\nNATO or the jolly green giant for the\ncrisis. Ido care that there is a crisis,\nand that people need help.\nThus I call on all media editors at\nthe college to do their bit by including a banner like the one above in\ntheir publications - and I include web\neditors and IC Reporter in that. Web\nbanners (similar to the one above)\ncan be taken from the Disasters\nEmergency Committee web site\n(www.dec.org.uk), while I will happily\ndesign a high resolution version that\ncan be printed. I also call on Felix's readers, and in particular some of the\nbetter paid members of the college,\nto respond to such pleas. And if any-one's got any good fund-raising ideas\nthen feel free to pop by for a coffee\nsometime. Perhaps we could auction\noff the spare granite from those infamous flower beds...\nSummer Ball\nThe Union has taken a chance by\nunderwriting the ball, so I would ask all\nthose in two minds as to whether to go\nto also take a chance and get a ticket\n(assuming the previous topic hasn't got\nyou saving every penny). I don't think\nit was made explicit in the article on\npage one, but this will be IC's second\nball ever, and if it doesn't work out\nthere won't be one next year. So the \"I 'll\ngo next year\" defence won't work. I shouldn't really need to persuade anyone - the event speaks for itself, and\nlooks like being the highlight of the\nyear - but I guess student apathy, and\nthe nervous smiles seen in ICU when\nthe subject is mentioned, have finally\ngot to me.\nA previous editor of le lix had an\nidea for such an event as the ball. Basically, it involved producing a newspaper\nevery hour for the duration of the\nevening, using digital cameras and fast\nphotocopiers. So your em baras sing antics are down in print for all to see on\nthe night. It would obviously take a dedicated and efficient team of journalists and editors to make such a stunt\nwork, and is unlikely to happen this\nyear, but if anyone is keen on the idea,\nlet me know.\nOh, by the way, welcome back\nI knew there was something I had forgotten to say.

    "content": "12 Clubscene 26 April 1999\nPaul Van Dyk Special Feature\nPAUL VAN DYK is currently one of the biggest names In Djing in the world, and has started 1999 with his biggest hit yet\n- his new remix of Humate's 'Love Stimulation', which entered the UK singles\ncharts at 18 and stayed there for four\nweeks.\nThis is only the start of what promises\nto be a great year for Paul, who is working on his new album, 'Avenue Of Stars',\nset for release on Deviant later in '99. It's a year that could hardly have gone wrong after he kicked it off with a live New Year's Eve/Day triple-header, playing to\npacked clubs in Milton Keynes, Stoke\nand Sheffield between mid nid gh t and6 am, and still getting home in time for\nlunch.\n'Avenue Of Stars' will follow-up to\nhis remix collection,' Vor sprung Dyk Technik', his acclaimed triple-CD remix\ncollection. That came in the wake of his\nfirst Top 40 hit, To rAn Angel'98', which entered the national charts in August at\nnumber28 and spent four weeks in the top 75 and two weeks at number one in the dance chart.\nIn a hectic 1998, during which 'for\nAn Angel' not only hit the charts but also\nappeared on a mind-boggling variety of TV and radio shows from the fairly-pre-dic table MTV to the less-predictable\nGrandstand, Paul also enjoyed ten top40 hits as a remixer.\nHe was voted6 th best DJ in DJ\nmagazine's authoritative end-of-year\nchart. He won Bassline magazine's Best\nInternational DJ award. He was voted Best International DJ in Northern Ireland'sBB M magazine. He was nominated for Best International DJ in the1998M uzi k awards and, among his many Djing road rips, he established a residency at New York's Twilo Club (Sasha,\nDig weed and Carl Cox are the other 'res-idents').\n'Avenue Of Stars' will constitute the follow-up to his acclaimed 1997 album 'Seven Ways', which spawned three singles in 1997, 'Beautiful Place', ' forbid den fruit' and 'Words'.\nSo where did all this start? Well, in\nEisenhuttenstadt in the old East Germany: a state where the premier Erich\nHonecker reacted to the Soviet policy of glasnost with the retort, \"If your neighbour redecorated his flat, would you redecorate yours?\", and freedom of movement and creative activity were destinies less likely than a lifelong career\nin a Trabant factory, labour ing under the\nimpression that Western music stopped with The Beatles and Elton John.\nPaul van Dyk - favourite group, New Order - spent his last few years in this\ndying outpost of state-control socialism\ndeveloping, but unable to feed prop-er ly,a growing appetite for house music,\nwhich he first heard on western radio In\n1985. He taught himself to mix on \"two\nfucked-up old turntables and a very old mixer\". However, like those of many of his compatriots, his ambitions seemed unlikely to be fulfilled.\nPaul Van Dyk In crap camera pose.\nBut seismic political and social\nupheavals throughout eastern Europe\nled to the fall in 1989 of the Berlin Wall\nand, as East and West Germany headed towards reunification, far-reaching\nreforms in the East permitted adventurous souls to up anchor and set off for\nwhatever and wherever they fancied - in\nPaul's case, the organically expanding and occasionally exploding rave/club\nscene in Berlin, where he arrived armed only with his primitive mix tapes and started Djing in March1991. The Berlin scene was moving at a hectic pace but Paul van Dyk was moving even faster and it took little time for\nhis unique blend of uplifting trance and progressive house to establish him as\none of the leading DJs on the reborn\ncity's vibrant club scene. He became resident at Dub mission at E Werk, hottest\nspot in a non-stop musical heatwave.\nAnd, sooner or later, just driving the decks would not be sufficient outlet for\nhis talent.\nThe men to realise this first were Mark Reeder (ex-pat Man c uni an) and Torsten Jurk (East German cohort) - both\nrefugees from the DDR who were busy\nrecording the new music of Berlin and its\nenvirons on their MFS label. They encouraged Paul to take the step into the studio and the first result was the Visions Of Shiva project, cooked up with keyboard\nmaestro Cosmic Baby, and coming up\nwith two acclaimed singles, 'Perfect\nDay'(1992) and' How Much Can You Take?' (1993).\nVisions faded, but Paul went on to\nbecome an MfS artist in his own right,\ndebuting with 1994's 'Green Valley' EP\nand following through with the'45 RPM' album later that year. Demand also grew for his talents as a remixer. from'93 onwards, he could be found sprinkling\nthe fairy dust on tracks by artists as\nobscure as MFS labelmates Hu mate and DFM, as unlikely as Madchester survivors\nInspiral Carpets (another of the young FVD's favourite listens in DDR days) and as big as New Order, Tori Amos and Dina Carroll - fabulous remixes that can be found on 'Vorsprung Dyk Technik'.\nAnd all the while he built his international\nreputation as a brilliant and innovative\nlive DJ, both in Europe and the States.\nPaul van Dyk's soulful music is\ninformed as much by the raw melancholy of the New Order and Smiths\nrecords he listened to while holed up in\nEisenhuttenstadt as by the house and techno that led him up the road to Berlin\nand beyond. His prescient records are\ninformed by the knowledge that electronic music must convey emotion if it is\nto swerve anonymity and earn the love\nof a broad public rather than the casual\nattention of a one-night stand club\ncrowd.\nHis Deviant releases which, since\nthe 'Seven Ways' album, have paralleled\nthose on MFS, represent the foundations of a body of work which will long outlive even the cream of any year's fashionable dance genre. Long un arguably the top DJ in Germany, he has not\nbeen bound by the German scene rather, he's become a worldwide ambassador for it and a personal embodiment of its qualities. He maintains a home base in Berlin, but wherever you are, he will be with you soon.

When this album says\n'explicit' it means it. If you don't want your cars polluted with tales of murder, rape, multiple suicide attempts, theft, underage sex and drugs don't get this album. If, on the\nother hand, all this stuff sounds bang up your street this is a prime example of the genre.\nSlim Shady is the new name of tm in em, Dr Dre's( of NWA and Fuck th a Police fame) latest student. Wil h this\nkind of backing, it's pretty definite that\nthis album will get lots of attention - but\ncan Eminem keep this attention with a prime slice of raw rap with a funny edge?\nYep. Looks like this is going to be one of the largest rap albums of the year. I think the secret to this album's attraction is the fact that every track is a little story ail in itself. Brain Damage\nrelates to Lm in em's revenge on his former high school bullies. '97 Bonnie &\nClyde is a very messed up little tale of Eminem murdering his ex-wife, ex-wife's new husband and son. After committing this terrible crime he proceeds to take his\ndaughter back and drive to the beach to\ndump the bodies of his victims. I know this sounds a little sick but this song is\nreally all about his daughter and how much he loves her, a really sweet ballad\nwhich gets a little sick.\nIf I Had talks about all Eminem' s woes with the world, he says he is 'tired\nof being white trash', 'tired of having a lack of funds and resorting back to guns'\nand' wearing the same damn Nike Air\nhat'. He also says that 'If I had one wish,\nI would ask for a big enough ass for the whole world to kiss.' As well as talking\nabout what he sees on the street, he also\nmaintains a comedy edge that somehow makes it all the more poignant.\nJust before it all gets too serious he\nwhips it back in with his ' dance' song, Cmon everybody. A tune in the fine tradition of Will Smith - this would be a sure\nfire hit if he ever gets around to releasing it, and cutting al! the swear words out. Which would probably ruin it - but\nain't that just the way of making it palatable to mainstream America's generation\nX 'ers.\nA great album, full of funny as hell\nlyrics and large beats to go with it thanks\nto Dr. Dre. Get it before he gets too commercial and forgets where he came from. And forgets how to swear so Imaginatively. H Joel\nMATTHEW MARSDEN\nSay Who |\nMatt, mate, do us a favour -give up your day job.\nThrow away-pop would be a harsh yet accurate way of describing the12 sloppy tracks\non this album. With his boyish charm and supposedly amazing good looks,\nMr Marsden has been manufactured to\nmake the heart of any young teenage girl miss a beat. Here arises a problem in that Iam neither 15, nor doI read\nSmash hits or JI 7. Despite this, I'm pretty sure that if I was or did, I would still\nhate this album. Matthew Marsden is yet another attempt by record companies to create\na perfect little package of 'sex-appeal\nthat can sing'. He sounds very similar to\nGary Barlow but that's where the similarity ends. At least Gary Barlow had a bit\nor originality about him in his style of music. One of Marsden' s whiny love\nsongs is just about bearable. But twelve\nof them, back to back, are enough to\nmake you want to go and throw yourself\nout of the nearest window screaming' No More l' Yes, believe mc, it is truly that\nbad. It isn't really Matthew's fault that he is rubbish, though. Afterall, he didn't write the awful songs that he sings. He co-wrote 4 of the 12 tracks (including my particular favourite Say Who) but you wouldn't have noticed - they are just as\nboring and na ff as all the rest. There are\ntwo singles on this album that have\nalready been released. If you know The\nHeart's Lone Desire and She' s Cone,\nthen you know the type of thing we're into here.\nOn a more positive note, the album is well produced with the first few seco nds of each song sounding pretty\ninteresting. It's just the remaining2 or 3\nminutes that spiral down toward new levels of crap-ness never quite reached before/That sinking feeling usually starts\nat the same point that Matthew starts\nsinging. It is not as though his voice is\nbad, it is just that it is so ' normal'. The, only possible use for this album, that I can think of, would be as background music when you are working. It is unique\nto me in being the only CD that can be listened to and not cause distraction\nfrom the task at hand. But, unless you are the type of person that goes into a music shop looking for something that\nit so boring your subconscious will block\nit out, I wouldn't buy this. CI\nIngrid\n\n"

I his 'catch up time' is essential for\nthe running of the Health Centre. I have pointed out repeatedly to David that our service arrangements, including the issue of opening hours, are constantly under review. We will be re-considering our appointment schedules to see how we can accommodate his concerns. David confuses the issue of per-ce i ved lack of appointments with lunchtime opening. Opening at\nlunchtime would not entail the crea tion of more appointments, merely the shifting of their time s,lur the r more, as David knows, the main reas on for scarce appointments during term-time is the very high non-attendance rate by students. Over100 Doc tors and Nurses appointments were lost during the month of February due to non-attendance, mainly by students.\nIf students let us know when they are\nunable to attend we would be able to\noffer those appointments to others. The Health Centre is not a department of College. It is an independent general practice contracted to provide a student health service and an emergency service during working hours. By\nfar the majority of our funding comes from the National Health Service and not from the College. The College liaises with us as to how we provide the services that are contracted within the confines of the financial arrangement between us, and MAD SAC is the advisory committee that effects that\nliaison.\nWe would ask David that, when advocating 'affirmative action', he bear\nin mind our patients' comfort, safety\nand confidence when using the health\ncentre, and their right to confidentiality and privacy when accessing the service. However attacking the Health C en tre isn't the way forward. The staff are dedicated and caring and always avail-able to deal with urgent cases. They provide an excellent service.

The\ndecision to confirm the event was taken\ndespite the sponsorship problems the ball\nhas been facing, leaving the summer ball\ncommittee with the daunting but accomplish able task of acquiring funds for the ball\nthis term. David Hellard, ICU President,\nhas welcomed the news, assuring students that \"anyone who goes will love it.\"\nThe summer ball was in and out of financial difficulties for much of last term\n('Summer Ball's Sponsorship Ordeal, Felix\nissue 1134), after a succession of sponsorship deals with various companies fell\nthrough. It had been hoped that Procter &\nGamble would provide a large amount of money for the event - in an email dated 19\nfebruary a representative stated that several recruiters \"would like to offer some sponsorship\". On21 March, however, Procter & Gamble decided to pull out of the\ndeal. On the same weekend Unilever also\npulled out, leaving the ball without any major sponsors. Since then the committee\nhas had some success, with sponsorship\nfrom Goldmann Sachs and L 'Oreal looking\nlikely.\nMore progress has been made thanks\nBy Ed Sexton\nto the Alumni Office, under the guidance\nof Clive Oakley, with \u00a33000 to \u00a35000 now looking like an achievable amount of money from old Imperial students. Approximately \u00a32000 in sponsorship was also\nobtained over Easter. College, however,\nhave been less forthcoming. Nick Griffith,\nChairman of the summer ball committee,\npresented college with a proposal\nIntended to encourage sponsorship of the ball some time ago. In Ihe proposal he\npointed out that such an event \"reflects\nhighly on the college\" and would attract\nalumni and staff, as well as current stu-dents. If the ball became an annual event,\nlike the May balls at Oxford and Cam bridge, it could also promote Imperial in\nthe media and industry sectors. College\nrejected these arguments, with the Deputy\nRector insisting that he could not give\nmoney from his funds, as these are\nreserved for academic developments. Dave Hellard summed up how he saw the\nCollege's position,- \"anything to do with the\nstudents should be funded by the Union\".\nCurrently a further \u00a37500 is needed, assuming 1500 tickets are sold (generating\njust over \u00a380,000). The Union has underwritten the event, meaning that any shortfall will have to met from the Union's reserve funds, \"tickets arc \u00a310 more than\nlast year, costing \u00a355 for students. Nick Griffith justified the increase by explaining the\nvariety of attractions that should be present\nat this year's ball. The event should include\na big wheel, a classic horse carousel,\ndodge ms,a casino, a cover band and, hopefully, a guest speaker. Coaches to\nthe event arc being provided by Capital\nCoaches, and should hopefully be better\norganised than last year, when most of the\ncoaches were late.\nAs well as praising the Alumni Office,\nNick Griffith cautiously welcomed the Union's support, thinking that \"the s a bbs deserve some credit\". Feelings towards\nthe ball in the Union have been mixed,\nmainly due to the serious financial problem\nthat will result if tickets do not sell well.\nAnother contentious issue is the relationship between the ball and the ICSM su mmer ball, which is scheduled to take place\nthe day before IC's,on Thursday 24 June.\nWade Gayed, ICSM president, was insistent\nthat he did support the IC ball, but was mindful that there arc \"strong feelings for\na separate ball in ICSM\". Although supportive of the idea of a combined ball, he\nfelt that the medical merger was not long\nenough ago to stage such an event; \"one\nyear is too soon to expect a single ball... no\nmedics are going lo IC's ball, except first\nyears\". Dave Hellard agreed that a lot of first\nyear medics would come to IC's ball, and said he could \"understand why they want\ntheir own ball\", but went on to claim \"ours\nwill be better\". The summer ball has survived the politics and financial troubles,\nhowever; now it is up to the students to make it a success.\nInformation\nTickets goon sale from the Union Office\non Friday 30 May \u00a355 for students\n- \u00a365 for staff\nThe summer ball committee would welcome suggestions for the guest speaker\nEmail n.g rl ff l th@ ic.ac.uk\nMore info: www.su.lc.ac.uk/summer ball Medics Football Fall from Grace\nICSM Football has sensationally been stripped of the First Division Championship,\nas a result of last minute wrangling s from\narch-rivals Guy's, Kings and Thomas' (GKT).\nThe Kings Medics successfully\nappealed against two fixtures, in which\nthey claimed ICSM Firsts had fielded a ringer, in the shape of Dr Jonathan\nHoughton. Dr Houghton completed his\ncourse last year, and consequently is no longer eligible for UL competition, but it is\nbelieved that he has played in all but two games of the season. Indeed, if the results\nof all the games in which his name appears\non the team sheet were overturned, ICSM\nwould be left with just six points - and would face relegation to the Second Division.\nCrucially, the reversal of the two matches (in both of which Dr Houghton\nscored) means a six point swing from ICSM\nto GKT, moving the Kings Medics to 43\npoints, and thus into first place, ea ring By David Roberts\nthem promotion to the Premier Division\n(where they replace the relegated Royal\nSchool of Mines squad). Meanwhile, ICSM\nFirsts drop into third place, behind UCL's second string.\nthe ultimate placings, however, arc.\nstill not final. ICSM have appealed against\nthe decision, and, although their appeal has\nbeen rejected by UL Sports League Coordinator Ruth Crawford at the first stage,\nthe final decision of Neil Walker (ULU's Sports Officer) was not known at time of\ngoing to press. Whilst it is possible that the\nICSM victories over GKT could be reinstated,\nthe appeal also carries with it considerable\ndangers, as an appeals panel would have,\nin Ruth Crawford's words, \"every opportunity to take whatever decision they felt\nappropriate...it is not beyond the realms of possibility that they could deem voiding of\nall matches a possibility\"- In this way, every\nmatch in which Dr Houghton played would\nbe declared an opposition walkover, and thus ICSM would be relegated to Division\nTwo. If that were not bad enough, the\nknock-on effect would be the automatic\ndemotion of ICSM Seconds to Division\nThree, as UL rules state that no reserve team\nmay play In the same division as their firsts.\nHowever, the most likely scenario\nremains the current status quo, as eligibility cannot usually be disputed after a match,\nunless (as in this case) the player concerned failed to produce a valid ID when asked to do so by the op pos lton on the day\nof the match. Consequently, as GKT arc the\nonly side to have disputed eligibility, the two\nmatches which have already been voided\nare the only ones which can realistically be\ncalled into question.\nUnfortunately, none of the ICSM squad\nwere available for comment - we'll bring\nyou the final decision next week.\nInside.. m Letters - Health Centre 4\nEditorial - Comment 5\nColumns -AllCampbell 6\nBirttldayS-A space filler 8\nArtS - ICU Choir 9\nClubSCene - Paul van Dyk 10\nMUSiC - tm in em14 Film - Orgazmo 16\nGames - X Wing Alliance 18\nSport - Netball Tour 20\nCrOSSWOrd -by Sheep20 "

If you are thinking along the lines of a wholesome ly attractive female college stu-dent, her sassy sidekick, and various\nblok es generally mouth y, nerdy or\nintermittently sinister - desperately evading a tooled upn utter then you' re not far from the mark.\nWe rejoin Love Hewitt a year on from the events of the first film which saw most of her mates d is em bowled with a big hook by an irate fisherman. Apparently, they had run him over,\nchucked him in a river and left him for\ndead the sort of treatment which would have even that most mild mannered of seafarers, Captain Birdseye,\nsharpening the fish knives and contemplating revenge. When her new best\npal Brandy (of \"and Monica\" fame) wins a holiday for four in the Bahamas, Love\nHewitt is persuaded to leave the college\ncampus behind for a few days.\nAfter all, it Is where most axe murderers do their best work and particularly\non the anniversary of a previous killing\nspree. Joined by a couple of guys from college, the pair head off to the sunshine, leaving all thoughts of evisceration behind them, but unfortunately the holiday island does not provide the reassuring sanctuary she's hoping for. It is\nthe stormy season and the place is all\nbut deserted, and Love Hewitt and co find themselves in that other stalwart\nscary film location, the isolated hotel.\nThe off-season staff introduce themselves and dutifully provide various\ndiversions while you attempt to decide who is a significant character and who is merely present in a hook fodder capacity.\nThe British director, Danny Cannon, handles the misdirection beloved of this genre competently, and when the homicidal fisherman finally arrives on the scene the expected escalating tension is delivered. In fact, it's not even diff used by the fisherman's more comical\nthen sinister choice of slasher get-up.\nI suppose a so u'w ester and raincoat are good for keeping the blood off\nyour clothes, but they're not as fright-e ning as a ski mask. With a plot as flimsy\nas the single ts which stricken heroines\nhave universally settled upon as this\nseason's de rig eur outfit for running away from a loony, this film offers very\nlittle beyond the standard shock tactics\nof a hundred other movies. It is\nundoubtedly polished, but, lacking the humour of Scream say, it is pretty uninspired. Plenty of shocks, but no sur-p rises. D Simon\nAn Ideal Husband * * \u2022\nStarring : Rupert Everett, Minnie Driver, Cate Blanchett, Julianne Moore, Jeremy Northam, Julianne Moore\nDirector: Oliver Parker\nT he first of this year's big screen version's of Oscar Wilde' s classic\nplay is a fairly straight-forward\nadaptation of his turn-of-the-century\ntale of gentle political intrigue and romance, brought to life by a lavish\nAnglo-American co production. Whilst the story is surprisingly relevant today preaching tolerance towards our ever-infallible fellow man( be they politicans or loved-ones) - the real winner is the script. Wilde' s characters come alive via his trademark witticisms and great battle-of-the-sexes\nbanter. Moreover, despite the fact that\nmost of the plot is unbelievably obvious, it somehow manages to carry you along without ever caring that it's so utterly predictable.\nThe other big plus point is Rupert\nEverett, perfectly cast as dapper man about-town Lord Arthur Goring, whose flippant, caddish exterior naturally hides\nthe hero who will ultimately get the girl and save the day. Julian nc Moore Wilde was clearly a big fan of gritty, sll ce of-life realism.\nadmirably demonstrates that she too are the real let-down, with Driver and know show to balance a delightfully Nor tam in particular delivering their\nover-the-top role, playing the villain of lines in a very stilted fashion, clearly not\nthe piece, the devious Mrs Cheevely. at home with the style of Wilde' s dia-It's the rest of the cast, however, who logue. One of the problems in her ant in\nadapting eighteenth and nineteenth century plays is that, by-and-large,\nthey're incredibly studio set, generally\nrevolving around drawing room antics.\nAn Ideal Husband is no exception, and in attempting to open out the script,\ndirector Parker walks a very fine line\nbetween90' s over-styli s ation and Wilde' s lightness of touch. Sadly, it's a line he crosses more than once, and consequently the all-important dialogue\nis occasionally swamped in faux-period\natmosphere. Nonetheless, he does a very good job of making the story\naccessible to a nineties audience. In essence, whilst it's undoubtedly flawed, this is nonetheless a carefully\nconstructed, loving recreation, bouy ed up by Everett's superb performance. Ultimately, however, your take on it\nwill depend entirely on whether you find Wilde'swords sparkling ly brilliant or\nsimply irritatingly clever-clever... Q Dave\n\n"

    "content": "18 Games 26 April 1999\nX Wing Alliance (PC)\nLucasArts\nOur beloved games editor and I have this\nrunning argument about which of the\nStar Wars spacecraft makes the best\nspace fighter. Last time we discussed it,\nhe plumped for the B wing on the\ngrounds that it was very tough, well\narmoured although possibly a bit slow.\nMy preference is for either the A wing or\n(if I feel like playing on the side of the\nEmpire) the Tie Advanced, both because\nthey are fast and very mano eu vr able. There has never been any debate about\nthe coolest ship in the Star Wars universe though; that honour has always\ngone to the Millennium Falcon.\nNow I know full well that many of\nyou keep back issues of felix in bound-leather folders, and quite probably lovingly laminate each new edition as soon\nas It comes out, so I won't bore you with\ntales of X Wing Alliance's predecessors\nwhich I( re)reviewed a couple of months\nago - look them up for yourselves. XWing Alliance is the latest in the series,\nand, as you'd expect from LucasArts, is\npretty damn impressive.\nX Wing Alliance starts shortly after\nthe destruction of the first Death Star and\nthe Hoth evacuation and runs to the battle of the second death star above the\nplanet of Yavin, roughly the same timeframe as Tie Fighter, and follows the\ncareer of the youngest son of a wealthy\ntrading family. This family gets involved\nin a trade war with a second rich trading\nfamily who, not being\nafraid to play dirty when\nnecessary, conspire to have\nthe first rich trading fam-i ly's assets confiscated by\nthe Empire. At this point\nthe family are forced to go\ninto hiding and the son\ngoes off to join the rebel\ncause.\nInitially you get to fly a couple of light freighter craft, both of\nwhich are related to the Millennium Falcon, and the first few missions are very\nmuch about learning how to use the\nextra functions available in these craft.\nThey do very largely replace the training\nmissions in the original X Wing and Tie\nFighter and, despite being wedged into\nthe storyline, do seem to fit in with what\ncomes later. Once you have flown a few\nmissions on the family's behalf, the storyline takes you to the Rebels and you\nstart flying for them.\nIn terms\nof gameplay\nthere are no\nhuge advances from X Wing\nor Tie\nfighter, but\nthe game\nreeks paya-bil it y. The\nmissions are\nvaried enough for a certain amount of\nlateral thinking to be required at times -the best policy is not always to blow\neverything else up - and you certainly\ndon't feel as though you are getting into\na rut which is always a danger In games\nof this kind.\nThere is a very strong\nmultiplayer element built\nin to X Wing Alliance\nwhich is integrated\nthrough the mission sim-ul at or, and allows you to\nmore or less build your\nown missions. Should you\nwant to you can create a mission to assault a Super\nStar Destroyer with a fleet of escape\npods (Tip Of The Day-you'll fail). If you\ndon't feel that's hard enough, how about\nsetting it in an asteroid field? Or a mine-field?\nThere is a huge range of ships that\nyou can build into your missions, from\nstatic bases (and, peculiarly, a casino) to\nthe large capital ships, smaller escorts,\nthe ubiquitous fighters, various freighters\nand transports and the already mentioned escape pods. The types of spaceships available have been increased\nexponentially, and now include all the\nships from\nthe films\nand the\nprevious games, most of\nthose from\nthe accompanying books, and\nsome which seem to\nhave been\nconjured up specifically for Alliance. It's tempting to think\nthat some of these new craft will be\nmaking an appearance in The Phantom\nMenace, but I guess we'll have to wait\nand see. You can fly most of the fight-ers, all of which have been given different cockpit interiors, and they have different flight characteristics that need to\nbe taken into account in your tactics.\nApparently this game has been in\nproduction for at least three years, and\na large part of that time has gone\ntowards a new graphics engine. This\nshows - the graphics are simply superb,\nespecially on a fast PC with a3D card. The\ngame will run in the earlier missions\nusing software rendering only, providing\nyou have a bit more RAM in your box, but\nonce you Join the rebellion, things will\nslow down without a bit of hardware\nacceleration - there are too many ships\nflying around. LucasArts have apparently claimed that you can have in the\nregion of 120 ships fighting it out at\nonce - the most I 've tried it on is about\n50 (plus mines), and it's almost\nunplayable then, not due to graphics\nslowdown: more because it's very hard\nto tell who you should be shooting and\nwho you shouldn't. It's a very hard game to criticise -fuca s Arts have been at the forefront of\nspace combat simulations since they\nreleased X Wing all those years ago, and\nit shows. The lessons from X Wing Vs Tie\nFighter have been learnt, and learnt very\nwell, and what we now have is a game\nthat is perfectly balanced between single\nand multiplayer elements. To sum up -new Star Wars flight sim, state of the art,\nlots and lots of fun.\nDanny\nCompetition Corner Commandos - Beyond the Call of Duty and Warzone 2100 for the PC for free\nDo you like your war close up and personal or do you prefer a bit of distance between\nthe guts and the guns. Well Eidos have managed to produce two excellent games,\nWarzone 2100 and Commandos: Beyond the Call of Duty that cover both the air-chair General and the armchair Lieutenant out there.\nEidos have also supplied us with a copy each of these games, and you can be\none of the lucky, lucky people to pick up a free copy. Just send the answer the following question either to fell x@ lc.ac.uk or pop the answer Into the office on a piece\nof paper. The first two people out of the hat will win.\nThe question is:\nWhich two films about blowing things up have Navarone In their title.\n(Hint Allstalr Maclean has a writing credit on both)\n\n"

    "content": "26 April 1999 Columns 7\nMalaysian Focus\nAnwar Ibrahim: Guilty as Charged. What Next for Malaysia?\nIt was a trial that had no precedent by Malaysian standards. Starting with\nastonishing revelations of the police's brainwashing methods, the public was first introduced to the concept of 'neutralisation' and 'turnover' in\nthe Anwar Ibrahim corruption trial. After\nthat it was a torrent of one bombshell after another and, up to a point, there was a sense of scepticism as to what or\nwhom to believe. When defence lawyers tried to adduce evidence of the existence of a political conspiracy to\ntopple Anwar, they were blocked by a series of rulings concerning their rel evan cie s by the judge, Augustine Paul.\nThere was even a joke going around about the judge's most used phrase during the trial, \" Not Relevant!\". He even went one step further by citing one of the lawyers as being in contempt of court and sentenced him to\nthree months in jail. Besides being the longest-running trial ever in Malaysia, the77 day hearing also broke many other records in Malaysia' s Guinness Book of Records: The first in which a former Deputy PM was brought to\ncourt, a first ever corruption case which didn't concern any money or use of wealth but only abuse of power, and the first in which the accused was o charged under an act that was virtually non-existent to\nbegin with. It was also unique in the way that the charges were amended by i prose iu lion when; doubts were raised by the defence over their accusations of sexual misc on duct by Anwar, resulting in state-ment s and evidence,- including the in famous king-size, semen-stained mat-tress, to be expunged by Judge Paul.\nIronically, the Black Eye inquiry was conducted concurrently with his corr up tion trial and exposed rather dist ur bing aspects of the police force. Anwar scored a bigpoint when the former-IGP, Rahim Noor, sensationally\nconfessed to beating the former DPM on the night of his arrest in September last year. That confession put the gove rn ment under immense pressure as\npeople expressed anger and disc on tent at the unprofessional conduct of the country's police officers. It is also\nbewildering how, at the moment, it is\npossible for Rahim Noor to be able to walk free without any action being taken against him despite having made NikB Hafiz\na clear admission to beating a handcuffed and blindfolded man senseless in the vicinity of the police headquarters. Anwar, in the meantime, had to Dr bail continuously see his request?\nbeing denied, and he still hadn't been proven guilty.\nWith such clear one sided treat-ment of the man, not many people held any illusion that on14 April, Anwar Ibrahim would be cleared of the four\ncharges. Thousands converged to the heart of the capital to show their sup port on the morning of the scheduled announcement. When Judge Paul, as\nexpected, read out a guilty verdict and punished Anwar with6 years in prison,\nmost were shocked at the lengthy sentence. People on the street wept openly, some claimed injustice and expressed disbelief. However, the most\nheartbreaking outcome of this was that\nsix young children were to be denied their father for a maximum period of six\nyears. The eldest of the six, Nurul Izzah,\nwho had been a pillar of strength for\nher mother, Dr Wan Aziz a h,and the rest of her siblings ever since her father\nwas arrested, broke down in tears upon hearing the verdict. It was not only a sad day for Malaysia but, more significantly, for this family of seven to whom many ordinary Malaysians had opened their hearts since this debacle began. So where do Malaysians go from here? Noone can really predict. The whole experience has been an eye-opener to many, resulting in increased awareness among the usually apathetic\nmajority. Dissatisfaction with the ruling\nparty had grown exponentially since\nAnwar launched his ' reform as i' movement with the exposure of corrupt practices within the government. Questions have been raised over the inde-pen den ce of the judiciary, police professionalism, justice, freedom of the media, rights of expression and democracy. Malaysians must now continue their quest for change without Anwar, since he will effectively be out of politics for almost a decade. How ever, his presence will be felt and what he has accomplished and suffered, along with many others in the past\nfew months, will definitely have an\neffect on the future of the Malaysian political scene, and the country as a whole. Thought for the Day\nIt's nearing examination time, ladies\nand gentlemen. The senior members of the student populace will be facing stressful times, and could no doubt do with some practice at interpreting\nexam-type questions. To help out with\nthis, I have generously set you a little\nproblem to prepare you all for the trials\nahead. Read the following carefully: \" Num ber one back and sides, cut short on top and layered in, please.\" Think you could understand that? Does it seem straight\nforward enough? Does it bear any resemblance to the phrase \"I would like\nto leave your establishment looking like\nMichael J fox?\" I didn't think so. If you can spot the difference between these two requests, then I offer my heartfelt\ncongratulations. You are officially a better candidate than the utterly in comp e tent woman who cut my hair on Gloucester Road once.( The precise location of the business in question is still a secret.) You may wonder how such a fundamental error could be made by\nsomeone whose livelihood ought to Chop chop...\nconsist of not making people look like\nMichael J fox. If this is the case, then\ndon't look at me for an answer1 had no idea as\nI fled the building with my hat firmly in place. Perhaps\nthe fact that the ScissorB rand l shing Representative of Doom didn't speak\nany English was a contributory factor, or at least no dialect I'd ever heard. The\nfabled London service\nindustry claims another vic-tim.\nIf this ever happens to\nyou, take my advice - don't be tempted to get the clippers out when you get\nhome. Needless to say,\nthis is exactly what I did and was rewarded with a nice bald streak up the back of my head for my troubles. Bloody\nhell -1 now looked worse than Michael J Fox. Feeling persecuted, miserable and downright stupid, I did the only sensible\nAll Campbell\nKeep those scissors away\nthing - went to bed, hoping that it would look better in the morning. Guess what?\n- it didn't.I finally solved the problem in my usual manner by throwing good money after bad, and getting it fixed up at\na rather more expensive\nestablishment in a remote part of London, making it a financially\nintensive venture indeed. This is just the worst example of along string\nof misfortunes, all of which have revolved around the deceptively stressful goal of a simple\nshort back and sides.\nI cannot possibly stress enough just how much I hate having my hair cut. I loathe it. I dread it. I wouldn't call myself an introvert, but there are certain situations in which I just don't fancy\na pleasant chat. Cab rides are one of them. Having my hair cut is another.\nYou can't run away, or hide. You can't be\nrude. And you can't just say nothing, for\nfear of retribution. These people have\nabsolute control. They have the power to make you look like a million dollars,\nor like an absolute monkey, in just ten minutes, depending on how they feel\non a particular day. There is no recompense. Coming from the North doesn't help either, especially when your torturer\nis feeling vindictive. To ask someone to\nrepeat something once is embarrass-ing. To ask them to repeat it twice is\nhumiliating. I usually bottle out on the\nthird occasion, and just grin and shrug\nin a vague fashion, which can be fatal if\nthey've just asked you whether you want\norange streaks.\nSo if there is a budding entrep en eur out there, looking for that lucrative, elusive gap in the market, consider setting\nup a chain of hairdressers whose modus operand i is that they will not say a word during the entire process. You'd make an\nabsolute packet. 'Introcuts'. I can see it\nnow. "
