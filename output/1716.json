From film nights\nand quizzes, to bar nights\nand art exhibits, we\u2019ve\nspent this month bringing Imperial\u2019s LGBT+\ncommunity together to\ncelebrate the accomplishments and reflect on the\nstruggles of those who\nhave come before us.\nWe\u2019ve had a busy\nmonth, kicking off with\na Bar Night at South\nLondon\u2019s oldest surviving\ngay venue, the Royal\nVauxhall Tavern. With\ndrag acts, stand-up comics\nand many other talents\non display, it was a great\nnight for all who attended.\nOur members attended\nscreenings of two films\nshining a spotlight on\nqueer relationships, The\nFavourite and Disobedience, hosted by Imperial\nCinema, and visited \u201cThe\nOscar Wilde Temple\u201d\nat Studio Voltaire, an\nambitious and immersive\nexhibition celebrating one\nof the earliest forebears\nof gay liberation. The exploration of queer art and\nexpression was continued\nin an Arts and Crafts\nevent co-hosted by IQ\nand Leonardo Fine Arts\nSociety.\nWe liaised with the\nCareers Service to hold\nthe inaugural LGBT+\nCareers Event, a hugely\nsuccessful event that\nconnected students with\nL G B T + - s u p p o r t i n g\nemployers, followed by\nsome of our members\nattending a panel hosted\nby the IC Investment\nSociety, featuring senior\nprofessionals discussing\ntheir outstanding work to\nimprove the inclusiveness\nof their workplaces for\nLGBT+ people.\nLGBT+ History Month\nculminated with National\nStudent Pride, an annual\ncelebration of the young\nLGBT+ community at\nuniversities from across\nthe UK, and the world.\nWith three days of parties,\ndebates, recruitment fairs\nand exhibitions, it\u2019s the\nlargest celebration of\nLGBT+ youth in the UK,\nwith over 1700 students\ntravelling to London to\ntake part in the festiv-ities. This year was no\nexception, and it was a\ngreat weekend for all the\nImperial students who got\ninvolved.\nAlongside LGBT+\nHistory Month, February\nhas also been Black\nHistory Month in the US.\nTo celebrate this, we\u2019ve\nadopted the redesigned\npride flags introduced by\nthe \u201cMore Color More\nPride\u201d campaign. These\nnew flags, first raised in\nPhiladelphia in 2017,\nintroduce black and\nbrown stripes to the iconic\nrainbow flag. These two\nsimple stripes aim to acknowledge and celebrate\nthe role of people of colour\nin the LGBT+ community,\nwho have too often been\nmarginalised, ignored and\nintentionally excluded.\nWe\u2019re also planning on\nchanging our logo to not\nonly better reflect our\nidentity as Imperial\u2019s\nLGBT+ Society, but also\nto ensure that our logo\nrepresents every member\nof the LGBT+ community\nat Imperial, regardless of\nrace, sexual orientation or\ngender identity.\nOur community has\nmade such incredible\nprogress over the years,\nbut there is still more\nto do. IQ will continue\nsupporting the LGBT+\ncommunity at Imperial\nand throughout London,\nwelcoming truly everyone\ninto our society. We\u2019ll\nkeep running events,\nraising awareness, and\nfighting to make Imperial\na more inclusive place.\nThere\u2019s never been a\nbetter time to get involved\nwith IQ and the LGBT+\nSociety, so we hope to see\nyou all soon!\nAn update from\nour LGBT+ Officer!\nI\nmperial has three main avenues of LGBT+\nrepresentation: IQ: Imperial College LGBT+\nSociety, Imperial 600 (Imperial\u2019s LGBT+\nstaff network) and the Union Liberation &\nCommunity LGBT+ Officer. Having a society, a\nstaff network and an officer can be both a strength\nand a hindrance; it is always beneficial to have\nmore people advocating for queer issues, but it\ncan be confusing for students seeking support.\nAs such, integration of LGBT+ voices across the\ncollege was a significant priority this year.\nWhen I was elected LGBT+ Officer, as well as\nIQ President and Trans & Gender Variant Officer,\nit marked the first year of unified representation\nfor Imperial\u2019s LGBT+ students. In my various\nroles, I have managed to further develop several\ninitiatives. First, for the upcoming elections, I am\nworking with the Union Elections team to include\na statement whereby students can self-select\nto vote for Liberation & Community Officers.\nThis will not disenfranchise any students, nor\ncollect demographic data but, instead, allow the\nL&C Officers to be more representative of their\nrespective communities. Students will be asked to\nonly vote for L&C roles that represent them. I am\nalso working with the IQ committee to ensure the\nUnion LGBT+ Officer is involved with IQ in a\nmore overt way. In previous years, there has, at\ntimes, been a complete disconnect between the\ntwo entities. In addition, Imperial 600 has worked\nwith IQ and myself this month for LGBT+ History\nMonth events, thus furthering LGBT+ collaboration and unity on campus. Lastly, as IQ Trans and\nGender Variant Officer for the second year in a\nrow, I have been working on getting a fund set\nup for trans students to assist them with buying\ntransition related items that aren\u2019t covered by the\nNHS. This is currently in the works and should be\nannounced in another Felix article shortly!\nFinally, if you feel excited to show your pride\nor your support for the LGBT+ community at\nImperial, drop by the Union Reception to pick up\na rainbow lanyard and ICU trans and pride flag\nstickers. A limited number of pronoun badges\nwill also be available while supplies last (they/\nshe/he, others upon request). Also remember that\nyou don\u2019t need a PhD for a gender-neutral title\n-- StudentHub will happily change your ID card\nby removing the title or changing it to Mx if you\u2019d\nlike. If you have any questions about LGBT life\nat Imperial, drop me a line at jd4914@ic.ac.uk or\ncome to one of the upcoming IQ: Imperial College\nLGBT+ events!\nLIBERATION\nJehna Devraj\nLGBT+ Officer\n\u201cMore Color More Pride\u201d //IQ\n\u201cThere\u2019s never been a better time to get involved with\nIQ and the LGBT+ Society // IQ\n\u201cA successful month of\ninclusive and inspiring\nevents\u201d // IQ\n\n"

    "content": "The Price\nI\nn Arthur Miller\u2019s\n1968 play The Price,\nfour people quarrel\nover the price of\nold furniture. Yes, that is\nessentially the drama\u2019s\nsynopsis. Four characters\nin a New York attic,\ndebating the value of\nrelics of the past, piled\nup floor to ceiling \u2013\nfrom ancient dining sets,\nchairs, wardrobes, and\nold fencing equipment to\nan out-of-tune harp. But\ndon\u2019t be fooled: Jonathan\nChurch\u2019s 50th\nanniversary\nproduction of Miller\u2019s\nplay is far more than\nthat. Despite a seemingly\nmundane plot, The Price,\nstarring David Suchet\nand Brendan Coyle, is\nas absorbing as a thriller.\nVisually extravagant and\ndeeply emotional, it tells\na story about resentment,\nthe cost of success and\nthe difficulty of making\npeace with the past in\na heavily materialistic\nworld. As Arthur Miller\nput it himself: \u201cThe play\nis about people who make\ndecisions in life and the\nprice they pay for those\ndecisions\u201d.\nThe play\u2019s storyline is\ndeceptively simple. Victor\nFranz is a 50-something,\nutterly frustrated and\nbitterly disappointed\npoliceman, trying to sell\na houseful of old furniture\npiled up in an attic that\nwas once his childhood\nhome. Despite once being\na promising scientist, he\ndropped out of college to\nlook after his father ruined\nby the Great Depression.\nHe sees neither meaning\nin the past nor hope for his\nremaining years. At the\nsame time, he lacks not\nonly the courage to retire,\nas this would force him\nto recognise his failure\nto generate anything\nworthwhile through\nhis career, but also the\nwill to start over. Victor\nresents his older, long-es-tranged brother Walter,\nwho stayed in college\nand enjoys a career as a\nsuccessful surgeon. Yet\neven Walter fails to find\nmeaning or significance\nto his prosperity and\nfame. Over the course of\nan afternoon, duplicity\nand family secrets are\nrevealed. Walter, Victor\u2019s\nalcoholic wife Esther, and\nGregory Solomon, the 89-year-old Lithuanian Jew\nand antique dealer hired to\nappraise their possessions,\nforce the beat cop to face\na painful and long-stifled\nquestion, namely the\nvalue, or \u2018price\u2019 of his\nsacrifice.\nBoth brothers are\nmagnificently played.\nAs Victor, Brendan\nCoyle \u2013 whom you might\nrecognise from Downton\nAbbey as John Bates \u2013 impersonates perfectly the\nweariness of a man forced\nto acknowledge the pointless and meaningless fate\nfrom which he will never\nbreak free; a frightening\nwarning of how rapidly\none might waste their\nlife. Adrian Lukis also\nportrays Walter perfectly\nby capturing his fears,\nunease and the guilt of\nhaving gotten away. The\nwhole cast is undoubtedly exceptional, but it\nis truly David Suchet\u2019s\nmanipulative, versatile\nyet charming portrayal of\nGregory Solomon who\nis the play\u2019s icing on the\ncake. Although it is in\nfact a supporting role,\nSuchet\u2019s glowing performance turned this comic\nand eccentric character\ninto the star of the entire\nshow. Suchet played to\nperfection a seemingly\nharmless 89-year-old with\nextreme joie de vivre and\nincredible manipulation\nskills, but also with a\nvulnerable and wise soul.\nHe was certainly missed\nin the second act, where\nhe spent most of the time\noff stage.\nSimon Higlett\u2019s set\ndesign was a masterpiece\nwith massive amounts of\nchairs, tables, armoires,\nand mirrors stacked up\nto the ceiling, giving\nthe impression that all\nactors would eventually\nbe swallowed up by the\npile of old furniture. Sara\nStewart, playing Victor\u2019s\nalcoholic wife Esther,\nsuccessfully conveyed the\nperilous atmosphere as\nwell as the stuffy and discomfiting nature of sitting\nin a graveyard of objects,\nwhich, although once\nloved, are now worthless.\n\u201cTime is a terrible thing\u201d:\nin this line, Gregory\nSalmon truly encapsulates the whole essence of\nthe play.\nOn the surface, The\nPrice is about how much\nthe antique dealer will pay\nfor the long-neglected pile\nof furniture. But beyond\nthe obvious, the play addresses the price involved\nin self-sacrifice, the price\nwe pay for our success\nand ambitions \u2013 as well\nas the cost of dividing\nfamilies. Although it is\nnow 50 years old, the\nplay\u2019s message is more\nrelevant than ever in\nour current throw-away\nsociety. Miller compels us\nto reflect on the dichotomy of material wealth and\naffluence versus personal\nintegrity, something\nwhich affects every one\nof us, yet something no\none seems to care about.\nFinally, the play reminds\nus that while we are truly\nthe authors of our lives,\nwe must remember that\nthere is always a cost\nattached to our decisions.\nGlowing performances, powerful emotions and a wonderful set design result in a priceless production.\nTruly a production worth any price // Nobby Clark\nISSUE 1716\nFELIX\n13\nARTS arts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nARTS\nNina LitmanRoventa\nArts Writer\nWhere?Wyndham\u2019s Theatre\nWhen?

I\nhave come disastrously\nclose in the past but this\nweek I am genuinely\nworried that I am writing\nthis Editorial in vain.\nThe reason I'm worried\nis because it is past\n10pm and I'm only now\nwriting this Editorial. I\nknow what you're think-ing... \"But Andy, I swear\nyou always write your\neditorial late? 10pm on a\nThursday is pretty good\nfor you,\". This is true,\nwriting my Editorial at\n10pm on a Thursday is\nactually decent by my\nusually pretty unpunctu-al standards. However,\nthis week's issue of Felix\nis an important one - it\nincludes the annual review of the Sabbatical\nOfficers (excluding\nmyself) - and I am yet\nto write up three pages\nof the four page pullout.\nHopefully, you'll get to\nsee this Editorial but\nI'm still sifting through\nalmost three hours of\naudio recordings of\nmy interviews with the\nSabbs, so it's realistic\nthat this issue never sees\nthe light of day...\nConducting the\nSabb Review has been\neye-opening for me and\ngave me a really insightful\nlook behind the scenes\nin the Union. It is clear\nto me that there is a lot\nwrong with the structure\nof the Union and how\nthings currently operate.\nChief among these issues\nis the interaction and\nrelationship between the\nstudent-elected Officer\nTrustees and the Senior\nManagement Group\n(SMG). Together, the\nOTs and SMG form the\nLeadership team within\nthe Union, however there\nhas been an apparent\ndisconnect between the\ntwo at times this year.\nThe conversations I had\n2\nwith the OTs indicate to\nme that this disconnect is\nsomething that has been\nrecognised by members\nof the Union and steps are\nbeing made to mend this\nrelationship.\nWhen I interviewed\neach of the Sabbs, I\nmade a point of asking\nhow realistic they think\nit is to affect meaningful\nchange as a Sabb and their\nthoughts on being left out\nof big decisions made by\nCollege and the Union\n(recent examples include\nthe decision to stop\nserving evening bar food\nat h-bar and the decision\nto stop the trial of Union\nBreakfast). I asked these\nquestions because I think\nit's important, particularly\nwith elections coming\nup, for the student body\nat Imperial to know the\ntruth about what being\na Sabb entails so that\nthey can make informed\ndecisions in the coming\nweeks. The overall sentiment was the Sabbs was\nthat it is very realistic to\naffect meaningful change\nand there was a general\nfrustration at being left\nout of big decisions,\nespecially because these\ndecisions often reflect\nbadly on them. A common\ncriticism that I've heard of\nthe Sabbs is that they are\ntoo weak and this extends\nto a long-standing criticism levelled against the\nUnion - it has too close a\nrelationship with College,\nwhich makes it impos-siblefor it to effectively\nlobby College on behalf\nof the students. I hasten\nto remind the Sabbs that\nthey are supported by\n20,000 students and,\ncollectively, the student\nvoice is loud enough to\nforce College's hand and\nensure that the university\nis run in the interest of\nthe students. It's crucial\nthat this is not forgotten\nin order for meaningful\nimprovements to be made\nfor the lives of the student\nbody at Imperial.\nremain on a year if they\nare currently in their final\nyear to take up a full-time,\npaid position.\nThe Sabbatical positions include the Union\nPresident, one of four\nDeputy Presidents with\nindividuals mandates and\nspheres of responsibility,\nthe Felix Editor, responsible for the weekly publishing of this very paper,\nand the President of the\nICSMSU.\nNominations for all\nof these positions close\n\u201cLate last\nyear, Chinese\nscientist\nHe Jiankui\nclaimed\nto have\nsuccessfully\nedited the\ngenes of twin\ngirls to prevent\nthem from\ncontracting\nHIV\u201d\n\u201cCharles\nTitmuss hopes\nto question\ncandidates\n'about the\nfuture of the\nUnion, the\nstate of the\nUnion and\nwhat they will\ndo to change\nit'\u201d\n\u201cThe\ndiscussion was\ndominated by\nthe feasibility\nand safety of\nusing gene\nediting to\nalter human\nembryos\u201d\ntoday, March 1st\n, at noon.\nAspartofthecampaigning for Sabbatical roles, a\nlive debate between candidates running for these\npositions will be hosted\non March 6th, from 16.00\n\u2013 19.00 at Metric. The\ndebate will be a chance\nfor the candidates to elaborate on their vision and\nmotives beyond the limits\nof their manifestos and\nflyers.

The\ndebate will be chaired by\nCharles Titmuss, Felix\nComment Editor, who\ncan be watched by those\nwho are unable to attend\nlive, allowing more students to make informed\ndecisions about their vote.\nAnother way for students to keep up with the\ndebates will be through\nthe Felix Twitter account\n(@feliximperial), which\nwill be live-tweeting\nthroughout.

The\ndocumentary is one of\nthe multiple efforts to\nexpose the cruelty behind\nthe animal agriculture\nindustry.\nDuring the short but\ndense 45 minutes of the\nscreening, many students\nwere taken behind the\nscenes of intensive\nfarming units. The images\nshown were graphic.\nportraying the reality of\nintensive farming: abused,\ndiseased and suffering\nanimals. In addition,\nthe deep, grievous tone\nof Ed\u2019s narrative that\naccompanied these videos\nfurther intensified the\natmosphere in the room.\nAnyone who had bore\nwitness to those footages\ncould no longer leave the\nroom and simply say \u2018I\ndidn\u2019t know\u2019, because\nwe did, and it was almost\nimpossible to pretend that\nnone of the cruelty was\nhappening.

If\nThe film screening of a vegan documentary gives a graphic but true look inside the British animal agricultural\nindustry\nOne question that I\nthought reflected the\ncomplexity in making\nveganism mainstream,\nwas whether vegan/\nvegetarian people should\nbe purchasing the vegan/\nvegetarian options at\nchains such as McDonalds. These fast-food\nrestaurants are unlikely\nto have ethical sourcing\nat the top of their priority,\nand purchasing from them\ncould feed in to their\nbusiness which thrives\noff of intensive agricultural farming. However, if\nthere isn\u2019t enough demand\nfor these products, they\n\u201cThe images\nshown were\ngraphic\nportraying\nthe reality\nof intensive\nfarming\u201d\n\u201cIt was non-confronta-tional. Just\nthought\nprovoking.\u201d\nISSUE 1716\nFELIX\nWhat I personally\nfound even more com-pelling, however, was\nEd\u2019s talk that followed.\nAlthough I initially had\nthe impression that he\nmight expound his views\non veganism, he actually\nbegan the talk by frankly\nadmitting that he, not only\nate but, loved meat during\nthe first 21 years of his\nlife. He talked about his\nfrequent trips to Domino\u2019s\nand KFC. This was unex-pected, and I\u2019m sure some\nof the non-vegan students\nthat attended the event\nfelt more relatable to him.\nBy introducing himself as\nsomeone who, like many,\nsimply didn\u2019t know the\ncruelty of animal farming,\nEd instantly caught the\nattention of the whole\nroom. This was then\nfollowed by his journey\ninto veganism and his new\nprofound sense of needing\nto change.\nWhat I personally really\nloved about his talk was\nthat from the beginning he\nmade it clear that his aim\nwas not to make us all go\nvegan, but rather, to just\nget us to look at the reality\nand ask ourselves ques- These pigs look just about as happy as the Sustainability copy editors // livekindly\ntions. Why have we arbitrarily decided that some\nanimals like dogs and cats\nshould be adored pets, but\ncows and pigs are for us to\nconsume? Tradition and\ncultures aren\u2019t necessarily\nethical or just \u2013 slavery\nand female genital mutilation are cultures in some\nplaces. What gives us\nthe right to say that these\nanimals exist just to serve\nhumans? Just because we\ndon\u2019t see the killing, does\nthat mean we can pretend\nit doesn\u2019t exist? What\nmatters more, satisfying\nour palates or the life of\nan individual? How can\nthere be a humane way\nto kill if all organisms\nstrive to live? These are\njust some of the prompts\nthat he raised during the\nevening. It was non-con-frontational. Just thought\nprovoking.\n\u201cHow can\nthere be a\nhumane way\nto kill if all\norganisms\nstrive to live?\u201d\nwill stop selling them,\nwhich consequently gives\noff the impression to the\nmainstream that being\nvegan/vegetarian is still\nnot a societal norm. In\nresponse to this question,\nEd explained that purchasing these products\nfrom chains as McDonalds may be a necessary\n\u2018stepping stone\u2019 in putting\nveganism out there. If big\ncompanies could take on\nveganism, it could have\na more profound impact\non society as opposed to a\nspecialised, niche market\nthat only vegan people\nwould purchase from.\nAs the amount of\nmeat consumption has\nincreased rapidly in the\nlast few decades, it seems\nnecessary for us to take a\nstep back and look at how\nthis has impacted the lives\nof billions of animals.\nTelling someone to go\nvegan is most often not an\neffective or compassionate approach. But on this\nnight, I truly felt the power\nof simply witnessing and\nquestioning as a means\nof getting people to shift\ntheir own perspective.\n\n"

    "content": "Ovid\u2019s Metamorphoses\nTacenda\nH\now many\nways can one\nmake age-old\ntales fresh\nand exciting? In 80\nminutes, international\ntheatre company Pants\non Fire tells a selection of\nstories from Ovid\u2019s epic\nMetamorphoses: Jupiter\ntransforms his mortal\nlover Io into a sad cow\nin a gas mask, Theseus is\ntended to by a gaggle of\ngiggling nurses in a military hospital, Cupid is a\nlittle puppet evacuee who\nshoots Apollo and Daphne\nacross a party while the\ngramophone plays in the\nbackground.\nPeter Bramley\u2019s production transports these\nmythological tales to the\nsetting of the second world\nwar, with all its associated\nmilitary costumes, characters and paraphernalia.\nWhen Eurydice dies and\nOrpheus is devastated,\nhe follows her with his\nlyre, charming all in his\nway \u2013 to the Underworld,\nwhich in this case is\nactually the London Underground. The image of\ncharacters emerging from\nand descending down the\nescalators of the tube was\ncleverly done and very\nfunny.\nIndeed, the fantastical\nnature of the show relied\non an array of colourful,\ningenious props, and a\ncreative use of set. Four\nwhiteboards were moved\naround between and\nduring scenes to create\na changing space, from\nthe interior of a room\nto waves at sea. Props\nused were very amusing\n\u2013 as Ariadne sings of her\nloneliness after Theseus\nabandons her, cardboard\nwaves move in unison as\ntwo puppet fish join in the\nchorus.\nProbably the most\nmemorable story of the\nshow was that of Narcissus, who is recast as a Hollywood heartthrob who\nfalls in love with his own\nface on screen. Everyone\nin the audience probably\nhas the image of actor\nMax Gallagher on screen\nsmiling seductively in different angles seared into\ntheir minds. His seductive\nacting was so funny that\nwhen he reappeared on\nstage later playing the\ncello for another story, the\naudience laughed at his\nvery appearance.\nIt was clear that the\ncast was having as much\nfun as we were. The seven\nactor-musicians move\nfluidly between roles in\ndifferent stories, equally\nadept at playing instruments as singing and\nbeing godly. Lucy Egger\u2019s\noriginal music was fantas-tic, helping to tie the otherwise disparate stories\ntogether somewhat.\nOvid opened his poem\nwith the phrase \u201cI intend\nto speak of forms changed\ninto new entities\u201d \u2013 and\nindeed, the stories presented in the show emphasise the transformations\nbetween man and nature.\nDaphne turns into a tree,\nNarcissus into a flower,\nIo into a cow. Bramley\nchose to open his show\nwith the story of Tiresias,\nApollo\u2019s prophet famed\nfor his clairvoyance.\nTiresias predicts that\nthere will be a war in the\nfuture between man and\nnature, a theme that came\nacross as too didactic and\nin-your-face by the end\nof it. It is an important\ntheme, and very relevant\ntoday, but the importance\nof harmony between\nman and nature could be\nmore subtly dealt with.\nThe ample opportunities\noffered by the stories\nof fluid metamorphoses\nbetween man and nature\nwere not fully harnessed\nto bring across the point\nin a more elegant way.\nOvid\u2019s Metamorphoses\nhas received critical\nacclaim since its debut\nat the Edinburgh Fringe\nin 2010 and then off\nBroadway in 2011. It certainly does not disappoint.\nW\nould you\nwatch the\nsame day\nplayed out\nagain and again? Lizzie\nand Joy are best friends,\nbut as Joy is crashing\nat Lizzie\u2019s flat, they are\ngetting on each other\u2019s\nnerves. Joy is trying to\nget bored businessmen\ninterested in her free sanitary pads campaign, while\nLizzie\u2019s music classroom\nis about to be turned into\na shiny new computer lab.\nThe two meet up later to\nattend their friend\u2019s 30th\nbirthday party, taking out\nthe frustrations of their\nday on their friend and\neach other.\nThis same day is\nplayed out multiple times\nduring this show with\ntweaks in their dialogue,\ninteractions, and therefore\noutcome. In one version,\nthe two hide their respective bad days from each\nother, only to take it out on\nstrangers at the party later.\nIn another, Joy is brutal to\nLizzie, saying \u201cYou look\nshit. No, seriously you\ndo.\u201d Even Joy\u2019s taxi ride\nto the party is played out\nin different ways \u2013 she\nchats about her bad day, or\nplugs into her earphones\nto avoid any conversation\nat all.\nIt is difficult to understand the point of the\nshow from the outset. The\ndifferent versions of the\nsame day don\u2019t follow any\nparticular progression,\nand none result in better\noutcomes than any other.\n\u201cTacenda is an archaic\nterm referring to things\nbetter left unsaid,\u201d reads\nthe show\u2019s description.\n\u201cThis is theatre about why\nwe sugarcoat our words...\nTacenda will force us to\nrelive our mistakes until\nwe have the nerve to be\nstraight with each other.\u201d\nIf that was the point, it\ndidn\u2019t come across as\nsuch. None of the scenarios had the characters\nbeing more honest than\nothers, only differing\ndegrees of nastiness to\neach other.\nThis was precisely what\nI thought turned out to be\nthe message of the play\nin the end. That despite\ntweaking this and that\nchoice of words, leading\nto a shift in interactions,\nand therefore outcome of\nthe party and their days,\nnone turns out \u2018better\u2019than\nanother. Whether Joy and\nLizzie were honest with\neach other did not change\nthe fact that someone\nwould always mess up in\nthe party after \u2013 just in\ndifferent ways. Whether\nJoy placidly accepted the\nmanager\u2019s dismissal of\nher campaign, or swore\ncontinuously at him, or\nplayed the compassion\ncard of corporate social re-sponsibility, her campaign\nwas not accepted. What\nchanged was how she felt\nabout it after.\nIn the same vein,\nwhatever Lizzie said, her\nmusic room was going to\nbe taken away from her at\nschool. But it was in the\nsituation where she stood\nup to the head teacher that\nmade her feel better about\nit after. In a way, there\nwas an element of fate in\nhow the scenarios were\npresented \u2013 we cannot\nchange how things turn\nout, but we can change\nhow we approach them.\nIt was also interesting to\nsee how minor changes\nin what characters say to\neach other transform the\natmosphere of a certain\nsituation. The setting of\ncontemporary London\nand very millennial characters also made it feel\nrelevant to our mundane\ndaily lives.\nIn all honesty, it got\nrather tedious by the\nfourth scenario, and I was\nthinking, do I really have\nto watch this again? But\nthat feeling grew on me\nat the end, as it emphasised the Sisyphean feel\nof getting through our\nmillennial struggles. Too\nclose for comfort? Maybe.\nTypical millennial problems // VAULT Festival 2019\nTales from 8AD, brought to WW2 // VAULT Festival 2019\nISSUE 1716\nFELIX\n14\nARTS arts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nARTS\nJingjie Cheng\nArts Writer\nWhere?

James has seen major \"wins\"\nin his first six months largely because his manifesto\nbuilt on the work of his predecessors. These wins\ninclude the refurbishment and expansion of Ethos\ngym. He has also managed to secure almost \u00a3500,00\nfunding for the Union Concert Hall and is currently\nB\necause you're President, when you run\non a manifesto, you have quite a lot of\nbroad points and part of it is shaping a\nteam that will be able to do it rather than\nnecessarily taking on every single project yourself\nbecause it\u2019s simply not possible\". I feel like this\nperfectly sums up Rob's performance. He has\nbeen an effective leader, taking a more hands-off/\nManifesto\nWhat do I want? I want to ensure fresh ideas come through the union so that\nwe can make long standing positive change while building on the successes of\nthis year\u2019s team.\nWhat are my goals?\nFinance and Services:\n\u2022 Better funding for your constituent unions, clubs and societies through a\ncentralised sponsorship support centre*\n\u2022 Better food, including halal and vegan, at all hours, at all campuses\nthrough conducting a complete catering review.\nClubs and Societies:\n\u2022 Ethos expansion with usage-based equipment \u2013 lets end the overcrowd-ing.

IN PROGRESS\nwholistic approach to the job and ensuring that he appropriately supports\nthe Officer Trustees below him. Having said that, he has also done well to\nachieve the majority of his main manifesto points (see below; the stars indicate partially completed manifesto points). Outside of his manifesto, Rob\nhas been involved in various projects, including governance, disciplinary\nreview, Graduate Students' Union review, policy review and Officer Trustee\nrole review.\nFelix: Do you like the direction the Union is currently going in?\nRob: I don\u2019t think I would have run if I thought it was perfect \u2013 manifestos are\nalmost entirely about change, I ran on the idea of change. I agree with the vision,\nmaybe I have questions on how to get there. Overall, the big impact and the big\npieces we do are the right ones.\nWe\u2019ve recently seen examples of the sabbs being left out of big\ndecisions made by college/union \u2013 what are your thoughts on this?\nUnion decisions- it\u2019s part on us, recently we\u2019ve completely redeveloped the\nway that the Leadership Team works. That side has definitely been a challenge so\nfar but I think that the approach that we\u2019ve taken in the last couple of weeks in\ntackling that has been really positive and we are actually beginning to see a way\nforward and a framework that may work. The College side is really frustrating. In\nall honesty, we sit in too many meetings as it is. College is so large, it\u2019s impossible\nto be at every table, the challenge is making sure we\u2019re at the right table at the\nright time, which I think largely we are.\nClaudia Caravello - Deputy\nPresident (Finance & Services)\nC\nlaudia has arguably had the most difficult\ntime as a Sabb. Analysing her manifesto,\nalthough she has made some changes that\nshe said she would, there are substantial\ngaps. This is not completely her fault and complaints\nof \"friction\" between her and members of the Senior\nManagement Group (SMG). She told Felix, \"within\nthe Union, between the senior staff and the Officer\nTrustees, there is a disconnect. We have highlighted it\nand we\u2019re addressing it. In most cases, it\u2019s actually not\ntoo bad. I happen to experienced most of the extreme\nManifesto\nMy promises:\nSTUDENTS AT THE HEART OF DECISIONS\n\u2022 Making YOU the decision makers of events and big changes, so another\nBud Light incident doesn't happen again!\n\u2022 Infographics on how Union income is spent on YOU\nFOOD & DRINK\n\u2022 Focus on Union food quality and deals\n\u2022 Introduce online ordering system\n\u2022 Bring back SCR breakfast, or start it at the Union*\n\u2022 Reduce queues at Library Caf\u00e9 and College Caf\u00e9\n\u2022 Bring back bendy straws\nTRANSPORT\n\u2022 Transport to Harlington on Mondays and Wednesdays\n\u2022 Ensure students get home safe by introducing an end-of-night Union\nminibus drop off system\n\u2022 Improve minibuses upkeep\nCSPs\n\u2022 Negotiate with College to make more departmental spaces available to\nCSPs\n\u2022 Lunchtime drop-in sessions\n\u2022 Useful, quality training, delivered at the right times\nEXTERNAL INCOME\n\u2022 Make the Union less dependent on student spending\n\u2022 Develop online shop to sell to global alumni/prospective students\n\u2022 Advertise facilities to public during the holidays\n\u2022 Generate income from eActivities by licencing to other Unions\nends of this.\" Claudia also doesn't feel the Officer Trustees are adequately sup-ported, making her \"feel very lost\". She revealed, \"it has really taken a knock\non my confidence. The Union environment had got quite toxic at times. It felt\nvery lonely. It\u2019s been quite a big battle coming back from that.\" Claudia's experience as a Sabb highlights the problems with the structure that exists within\nthe Union and the need for adequate support, both pastoral and operational, for\nthe Officer Trustees. SMG has been described as her \"biggest obstacle\" when\ntrying to \"make a change\", however this has been identified and strides are\nbeing made to remedy this issue.\nAlejandro Luy - Deputy President\n(Education)\nA\nlejandro has had a successful six months\nin the role, completing the majority of his\nmajor manifesto points. He started off the\nyear by re-writing the training for academic representatives, which was met with widespread\npraise. Since then, his progress hasn't slowed. He\ntold Felix, \" I\u2019ve been working very closely with the\nStudent Shapers team to develop the whole program.\nWe\u2019ve developed everything from the criteria for\nManifesto\nImproved Feedback\n\u2022 Feedback at Imperial should be a strength, not a weakness. I will continue\nthe work of the current DPE so that every student at Imperial College\nreceives timely, high-quality feedback.\nStudent Involvement in Curriculum Reviews\n\u2022 As part of the Learning and Teaching Strategy, curriculums are being\nre-written across college and I am committed to seeing students integrated into the process from start to end.\nEnhancement of the Academic Representation Network\n\u2022 I will develop practical training materials and effective communication\nchannels to ensure that your Academic Representatives have the training\nand resources they need to represent you well.\nImplementation of StudentShapers\n\u2022 I will spearhead the implementation of the new StudentShapers scheme,\nwhich provides paid opportunities for students (maybe you!) to shape\ntheir own educations.\nPG Timetabling\n\u2022 This is still an issue, and it really shouldn\u2019t be. Just like DPE\u2019s before me,\nI will continue to fight to protect your Wednesday afternoons.\na project to what the partnership between staff and student should look like\".\nAlejandro's response to the news that h-bar would be cutting its evening bar\nfood service, without consultation with the Officer Trustees, is indicative of his\noptimism. He prefers to see this as an opportunity to look at providing a better\noffering to students through the Union. However, this could also be perceived as\nbeing unwilling to effectively lobby College for changes that would benefit the\nstudents. It is a fine balance indeed.\nFelix: How realistic is it to effect meaningful change as a Sabbatical\nOfficer?\nAlejandro: We are very privileged to have the level of influence that we have\nas sabbatical officers. The Officer Trustees have very close working relationships\nwith College - in those relationships, we\u2019re perceived as essential voices in the\nprocess of developing anything. We have a lot more influence and opportunities\nfor impact than I first anticipated\nManifesto\nEXPAND ETHOS GYM TICK\n\u2022 Pressure College to expand gym space\n\u2022 Investigate external gym and space provider partnerships across London\n\u2022 Pressure college for an investment into a wider range of sport and wellbeing facilities\nDEDICATED ATHLETICS HUB TICK\n\u2022 Join key parts of Sport Imperial and the Union, to make one team accountable for sporting decisions, with a student decision-maker at the top\nMORE BOOKABLE SPACE / PROCESS IMPROVEMENT\n\u2022 Pressure college to prioritise clubs and societies bookings in under-uti-lised space\n\u2022 Ensure CSPs have the appropriate space for their activity, and what is\nrequired to do their activity\n\u2022 Ensure students understand how key union processes work (ie minibuses),\nthrough mediums such as infographics\nONLINE CSP SUPPORT PORTAL\n\u2022 Create an online space for queries directing you to the relevant people\nimmediately\nREGULAR OPEN OFFICE MEETINGS / A FRIENDLIER UNION\n\u2022 Regular update meetings on my progress open to all\n\u2022 Regular open office times for students to come with queries\n\u2022 Regular visits to CSP activities to see problems first hand\nworking on a \"big project management piece\" looking to adapt the structure of\nthe Union itself. James told Felix: \"A lot of the problems that people have with\nthe Union are 'it's not very effective', 'we're not very efficient at dealing with\nprojects', 'we're not very good at replying to emails'. All of that is down to the fact\nthat, under our current model, there aren't enough people to do all of the jobs. It\nwasn't designed in a way to deal with problems effectively.\"\nFelix: Do you think sabbatical officers are adequately supported?\nJames: I feel our current structure and current way of working isn't effective\nenough to support the sabbs in the way it should be. Everybody has the same\nview of wanting to support the sabbs and wanting to do these new projects and\nwanting to get it done but the way we're currently set up means that's not always\npossible. I think everybody is aware of that and it's a pain.I dont think we're quite\nstructured right, I think there should be more flexibility within our structure so\nteams can work more collaboratively.\n\n"

In\namongst the useful tips on\nhow to alter our language\nto be more appropri-ate, the heartbreaking\nnational statistics about\nmental health illness and\nprovision and techniques\nwhich could help start a\nconversation about mental\nhealth, we discussed the\nmain problem: the way we\nare programmed to listen\nto each other.\nWhat do I mean? Well,\nthe very thought of silence\nseems to make people feel\ngenuinely uncomfortable\nso we \u2013 in this case the\nlisteners \u2013 feel obliged\nin a momentary silence\nto jump straight in with\ncomment/suggestions/\nideas/anecdotes to solve\nour friend or colleague\u2019s\nproblem. In doing so, we\nare never giving anyone\nthe space to feel heard\nbefore we take all the air\ntime and, let\u2019s be honest,\nnever really find out the\nfull extent of the problems.\nTo make matters worse,\nnot only have we been\nprogrammed by society\nto always fill silence, dare\nI say that in our College\ncommunity as scientists\nwe have a certain disposition to think of logical\nsolutions to seemingly\nsimple problems, as\nthough it is our place\nand position to determine\nwhether something\ncausing our friend or\ncolleague stress or worry\nis ours to judge the level\nof \u201csimplicity\u201d to it.\nMy point is thus, taking\nthe time to listen thoughtfully and completely is\nsomething which takes\nmore skill and practice\nthan we truly give it credit\nfor; sometimes it is difficult to see past our own\npersonal view of a situ-ation. For example, this\nweek is Eating Disorder\nAwareness week; I\nstruggled with Atypical\nAnorexia for around five\nyears but it can be almost\nimpossible to explain the\nfear, pain and anxiety\nthat thoughts around\nfood would have on me\nto another person, which\nin itself discouraged me\nfrom talking. Say I did\nfinally reach out for help\nand I was advised by a\nfriend/colleague that all I\nneeded was to \u201ceat more\u201d,\nI can promise you this is\nneither helpful nor supportive and I had actually\nalready figured that one\nout for myself. This\nmay seem like a stupid\nanalogy, maybe it seems\nobvious that it would be\nunhelpful to tell someone\nwith anorexia to eat, but\nthen why did I hear that\nvery phrase so often?\nFundamentally everyone\nwas so desperate to help\nand it truly came from a\nplace of caring, but also\nof misunderstanding,\nand we do this far too\noften without even re-alising. Often someone\nstruggling with a mental\nhealth problem knows\nthe \u201csimple solution\u201d,\njumping into a conversation when someone is\nconfiding in you to tell\nthem something they\nmay already know may\nactually at times be coun-ter-productive because it\ncan feel dismissive.\nThis is not to say you\nshouldn\u2019t talk to anyone or\nnever give advice; rather\nthe opposite, sometimes\nthe support from a friend\nis the first step to recovery.\nBut maybe, when there\u2019s\nthat inevitable awkward\nsilence or a problem\nseems to have a simple\nsolution, bite your tongue\nfor a few more seconds\nand encourage your friend\nto keep talking a little bit\nmore \u2013 there might be\nmore to it than the first\nbreak in the explanation.\nT\nhe PhD student\n\u2013 supervisor\nrelationship is a\nstrange one; it is\nrare that in a workplace\nyou would have a single\nboss for three to four years\nor have the flexibility to\ncome into work at 11am\nand have the freedom to\ntake three hours for lunch\nif you so wish. Then again,\na PhD isn\u2019t a normal job;\nit is understandable that\nyour PhD supervisor\ndoesn\u2019t have to behave\nlike a normal boss. When\nI started my PhD, I expected that I would have\nto manage my own time\nand experiments. That\nsaid, the frequency with\nwhich I feel like it is me\nand Google rather than me\nand my supervisor working towards a solution is\nstill unexpected (despite\nthe fact my undergraduate\ndegree thankfully prepared me for this).\nWe\u2019re often warned\nof the dangers of a boss\nthat is too hands on, but\nhave you ever considered\na boss that is so absent\nthat he\u2019s often considered\na visitor in his own lab.\nI often feel like I see\nmore days without the\nmention of Brexit than\ndays with the mention of\na lab meeting. And don\u2019t\neven get me started on\nthe things that I seem to\nbe expected to do outside\nof my PhD which often\nget communicated via a\nthree lined email with no\nsignature. Undergraduate\nstudents materialise with\nvague project titles which\nresemble something to do\nwith something I worked\non a while ago and spend\nan unnerving amount of\ntime asking when they\u2019ll\nmeet the person in charge\n(what, you don\u2019t trust\nme?!).\nis kind and interested in\nmy work. When present,\nhe is friendly, approachable and willing to share\nknowledge. A person who\ntakes an interest in my\npersonal life and wellbe-ing. It is just unfortunate\nthat without the postdoctoral staff leading the way,\nmistakes could end up\nbeing detrimental.\nThere are many people\nwho have it worse than I\ndo, and I appreciate that.\nIt could be worse, and this\nindependence is teaching\nme so many skills I\nprobably would not learn\notherwise. What I dislike\nis that a PhD experience is\noften completely dictated\nby the \u201cluck of the draw\u201d\nthat comes with supervi-sors. We need a system\nat Imperial that somehow\nsmooths over this variability and addresses the\noften-unpredictable behaviour that PhD students\nhave come to expect.\nStory\n\u201cA boss that\nis so absent\nthat he\u2019s often\nconsidered a\nvisitor in his\nown lab\u201d\nOn the flip side, we\u2019re\ntalking about a nice person\nhere.

In the\npast, where the play may\nhave ended with Orgon\nand his family playing the\nvictim, here we leave with\nan indescribable sense\nthat Tartuffe is a sort of\nvictim, and Orgon\u2019s\nbourgeoise lifestyle and\nthe allowances that are\nmade for him because of\nhis wealth, were more of\na problem that Tartuffe\u2019s\ndeceptive behaviour.\nIt just shows how\ntransferrable the subject\nmatter is \u2013 it really is an\nincredible thing that a\nplay 350 years old can still\nfeel so incredibly relevant\nto today\u2019s socio-politi-cal issues. From ironic\nreligious hypocrisy and\ndeluding the gullible to\nthe unjust abuse of wealth\nand power, Moli\u00e8re\u2019s\nwork of art has it all.\nhis skilful portrayal of\nthe enigmatic charlatan\nTartuffe, a remarkable\nbalance between charisma\nand oddity. With an\nobscure, slightly dodgy\nEuro-something accent,\nbizarre polka dot under-wear/printed t-shirt outfit\nensemble, and vague\nspiritual ramblings, he\nsomehow manages to\nweasel his way into the\nfamily and dupe the man\nof the house, Orgon \u2013\neven turning him against\nhis own relatives with\nS\net in the high\nsecurity wing of\nRikers Island,\nJesus Hopped the\n\u2018A\u2019 Train boldly contrasts\nthe stories of two inmates\nand the circumstances\nthat led them there. On\none hand, we have new\nprisoner Angel Cruz,\nplayed by Ukweli Roach,\nwho shot a religious cult\nleader \u201cin the ass\u201d for\nbrainwashing his friend\n\u2013 he\u2019s frightened, con-fused, and doesn\u2019t really\nknow where he stands or\nwhat\u2019s going to happen to\nhim. On the other hand,\nthere\u2019s veteran inmate\nLucius Jenkins, played by\nOberon K. A. Adjepong, a\nserial killer who endures\nlife on death row by\nGod-fearing preaching\nand unreciprocated philosophical discourse with\nsadistic, no-nonsense\nguard Valdez.\nThe dialogue goes from\nsharp and witty to deep\ndebates fluently, and the\nmen argue about forgive-ness, faith, redemption,\nresponsibility, and crime.\nThe delivery was spot\non, from Adjepong\u2019s\npowerful performance as\nalmost-too-righteous and\naggressively committed\nto his cause, to Roach as\nsuperficially cocky but in\nreality terrified. There\u2019s\nalso fine work by both\nJoplin Sibtain and Dervla\nKirwan, who play the\narchetypal callous warden\nand arrogant defence\nlawyer respectively.\nThe set itself, expertly\ndesigned by Magda Willi,\nwas evocative \u2013 a cat-walk-type stage running\nthrough the middle with\nseating on either side,\nand perpendicular sliding\nglass doors to signify the\ndivisions between jail\ncells. Young Vic plays\nare always interestingly\nstaged, but this design\nlent itself particularly well\nto the context. Aside from\nthe \u2018jail cells\u2019 and a chair,\nthere is nothing else \u2013 it\nis totally bare, with no\nclutter, both exposing the\ncharacters symbolically,\nand also allowing their\nemotion and acting to\ndo all the talking, so the\naudience can really appreciate it. It is interesting\nto see when the doors\nmove together and apart\nfrom each other, they are\nrepresenting the compression and decompression\nphysically, mirroring the\ncharacter arcs. The dense\nwriting really thrives\nhere, and as Willi says in\nan interview, they didn\u2019t\nneed much d\u00e9cor to make\nit work. The sound design\nstarts off slightly abrasive,\nwith the cacophony of\ntrumpets with lights out\nduring scene changes,but\nyou get used to it.\nIn short, the play is addressing important questions of facing up to your\nwrongdoings and holding\nyourself accountable, and\nwhether redemption is\never possible, which I\u2019m\nsure everyone can relate\nto (just maybe not on a\nscale this extreme). There\nare no easy answers, and\nwhilst you won\u2019t leave the\ntheatre knowing exactly\nwhat the message of the\nplay was meant to be, it\nprovides a lot of food for\nthought \u2013 and really, what\nmore could you ask for?\nUkweli Roach as Angel Cruz // Johan Perrson\nISSUE 1716\nFELIX\n12\nARTS arts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nJohn Donnelly successfully adapts Moli\u00e8re\u2019s classic 17th\ncentury satirical comedy for the modern-day stage,\nnow showing at the National Theatre.\nARTS\nShivani Gangadia\nArts Writer\nWhere?

Perhaps what\nhas made the play such\na staple in the world of\ntheatre is the universality\nof it. Donnelly makes\nit even more accessible\nfor all audiences by\nabandoning the original,\nperhaps more complicat-ed, rhymes in favour of\nmodern-day language to\nsuit the temporal setting.\nThis gives us more of\nan opportunity to focus\non the comedy and\nincredible physicality of\nthe production, such as\nOlivia Williams\u2019s Elmire\nleaping around the room\ntrying to seduce Tartuffe\nand expose him whilst her\nhusband lies hidden on\nthe sofa. The play has a\nslow start (still interesting\nthough), and the second\nscene really takes off, with\nfantastic performances\nfrom all the cast.\nThe real stand-out performance of course comes\nfrom Denis O\u2019Hare, for\n\u201cA real\nstand-out\nperformance\nfrom Denis\nO\u2019Hare, the\nenigmatic\ncharlatan\nTartuffe\u201d\nseemingly little effort.\nThe play snowballs\nfrom here, with the rest\nof the family scrambling\nto help the deluded Orgon\nsee Tartuffe\u2019s lies and\ndeception.

    "content": "COMMENT\nFRIDAY, 1ST\nMARCH, 2019 FELIX\n8\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nIs it #TimesUp for #MeToo?\nArts Editor Claire Chan thinks that the #MeToo movement has had unintended negative\nconsequences\nCOMMENT\nClaire Chan\nComment Writer\nI\nt\u2019s fair to say that\nthe #MeToo movement has been the\nmost significant\nsocial upheaval of recent\ntimes. Triggered by the\nmuch-publicised downfall\nof Harvey Weinstein, the\ntremendous outpouring of\nstories of both sexual assault and everyday sexism\nfaced by women on a regular basis became a force\ntoo powerful to simply be\nignored. All of a sudden,\nthe floodlights were on\nsexism, sexual misconduct and abuse of power\nlike they had never been\nbefore. More and more\nwomen came forward.\nIt was finally reckoning\ntime for all manner of\npowerful figures \u2013 CEOs\nand politicians, celebrities\nand TV hosts \u2013 who, like\nWeinstein, were once\nthought \u2018too big to fall\u2019.\n#MeToo has radically redefined how\nwe behave, think, and\nspeak about gender, sex,\nand power. But like any\nother revolution, it has\nits downsides as well.\nLast week, I wrote a\nreview of fanSHEN\u2019s\ninteractive jury game,\nThe Justice Syndicate,\nin which participants get\nto decide the outcome\nof a sexual assault case.\nThere was a clear power\nimbalance: Huxtable, a\ntop paediatric neurosur-geon, was accused by\nHodges, the mother of\none of his patients and a\nstruggling single mother\nof two. The evidence was\ndesigned to be equivo-cal, as is often the case\nin many actual sexual\nassault cases, where\nwhere physical evidence\nis often lacking.\nfanSHEN didn\u2019t\nhave the explicit aim of\ndiscussing the #MeToo\nmovement. They merely\nwanted people to \u2018think\nabout a challenging\ntopic\u2019 and consider\nhow they responded to\n\u2018situations of fundamental disagreement\u2019.\nNonetheless, the way in\nwhich my fellow jurors\nresponded to the simulated case was telling.\nDespite the paucity of\nevidence (both physical\nand circumstantial),\nmany participants were\nquick to point the finger\nat Huxtable. Indeed,\nthey claimed they \u2018knew\nin their heart\u2019 that the\nsurgeon was guilty.\nIn truth, I found this\nhighly disturbing. How\ncould they assign blame\nwith so much conviction\nwhen there was so little\nto go on? When ques-tioned, their response\nwas highly emotional.\nComparing the case to\nWeinstein and other\ninstances where men in\npower had abused their\npower, they refused\nto allow the \u2018arrogant\nsurgeon\u2019 to \u2018take advantage\u2019 of someone in\na vulnerable position.\nIt was almost like\nreverse victim-blam-ing. Although it seems\nobvious, it was difficult\nto point out to them that\nthe mere existence of a\npower difference doesn\u2019t\nautomatically mean that\npower is misused.\nIn the case of Harvey\nWeinstein, the case\nagainst him was solidified by the scores\nof women who came\nforward to testify,\nexposing his systematic\nabuse of power over\nyears. But not everyone\noffends so serially and\negregiously. What if\nprevious session that ran\njust after the allegations\nagainst Brett Kavanaugh\nhad been made public.\nThat game jury quickly\nfound Huxtable guilty,\nbut it wasn\u2019t even\nabout the specific case\nanymore. In the wake\nof #MeToo, I fear that\nemotions are running\nso high that it is easy to\nbypass rational thought\nand jump to conclusions\n\u2013 a dangerous situation\nwhen assigning blame.\nThere is little room for\nreasoned debate about\nsuch topics.\nAnd yet reasoned\ndebate is precisely what\nis needed when societal\nnorms change. What\nwas considered acceptable a generation ago\nwould now be seen as\nsexual assault. Consider\nthe iconic WW2 photo\nof the US sailor kissing\na nurse on V-day. Last\nweek, a day after George\nMendonsa (the sailor)\u2019s\ndeath, a statue commemorating the event\nwas vandalised with\ngraffiti reading #MeToo.\nWhether or not that kiss\nwas wrong, there certainly is a great deal of\nuncertainty now about\nhow men and women\nshould behave around\neach other, in both\nsocial and professional\nspheres.\nSadly, the outraged\nresponse that #MeToo\nprovokes does not lend\nitself well to open dis-cussion. I find it disturb-ing, too, that the wave of\nfury extends to people\nwho challenge the overwhelmingly positive reactions to the movement\nas depicted in the media.\nThose who voice doubt\nare subject to a swift and\nOverreaction or assault? // Sarasota Police Department\n\u201cMore than\nother crimes,\ncases of\nsexual assault\nelicit strong\nemotional\nresponses\u201d\nthere is only one victim,\nand the accused has no\nprior convictions? Do\nwe believe the victim?\nAnd if so, how can we\nlet the accused get off\nscot-free?\nTo be sure, it\u2019s a hard\ncall in any criminal\ncase, not just sexual\nassault ones, when corroborating evidence is\nlacking. More than other\ncrimes, however, cases\nof sexual assault tend to\nelicit strongly emotional\nresponses. In this case,\nI certainly felt that my\nfellow jurors\u2019 prejudices severely clouded\ntheir decision before\nthey\u2019d even viewed the\nevidence. The game developers told us about a\n\u201c#MeToo\nhas radically\nredefined how\nwe behave,\nthink, and\nspeak about\ngender, sex\nand power\u201d\nnon-penetrative assault\ncan leave no signs, and\nISSUE 1716\nFELIX\n9\nCOMMENT comment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nvitriolic backlash. Last\nSeptember, for instance,\nNorm MacDonald\u2019s\nappearance on \u2018The\nTonight Show\u2019 was cancelled after he said he\nwas \u2018glad #MeToo had\nslowed down\u2019. Perhaps\nnot the most sensitively\nworded, but hardly warranting a show cancella-tion. Actor Henry Cavill\nwas, equally, roundly\ncastigated on Twitter\ntrack on their statements\nand make very public\napologies. One wonders\njust how sincere those\napologies were.\nInstead of dialogue,\nthere seems to be a\ngrowing culture of\navoidance and silence.\nUnsurprising, when just\nvoicing dissent can get\na man in trouble, and a\nsingle accusation could\nruin his career, or at least\nbring it to a grinding halt\nfor the months of trial.\nWhat counts as harassment in the workplace\nnowadays?

Back in\n2017, I thought this\nridiculous, but given the\nhighly charged climate\nwe now live in, I can see\nwhy men would avoid\nputting themselves in\nsituations which might\nbe potentially compro-mising. Unfortunately,\nthis only makes Wall\nStreet (and other places)\nmore of a boys\u2019 club than\nit already is, and hardly\nhelps gender equality in\nthe workplace.\nIn our little jury,\nthe discussions were\noverwhelmingly dominated by the women\nin the room.

Michael Cohen testifies before Congress, almost coherently.\nPOLITICS\nGritty\nSon of God\nT\nhe profligate son\nreturns, crucified\nfor calls to revolution and arisen\nafter three days (and two\nmonths or so). Keeping\nwith the theme \u2013 three\nindependent stories from\nthe past two weeks.\nVenezuela.

This\ntwo-step recipe quickly\nbuilds a failed state, which\nis convenient for the installation of multinational\noil company infrastructure\non VZ land. Right outta\nthe ol\u2019 playbook.\nBernie is running \u2013 his\n2016 money machine\nrebooted, and the other\ncandidates have collectively (more or less)\nshit the bed. These are\nanti-establishment years;\nadopting left-populist\npolicy-focused platforms\n(as I have argued before)\nis the most viable 2020\nelectoral strategy for\nDemocrats. So long as\nSchultz doesn\u2019t spoil the\nelection (quisling centrist\nlimousine shitlibs don\u2019t\nhave the balls to reject\nthe Church of Fiscal\nConservatism), we have a\nfrontrunner.\nBig fun news this\nweek \u2013 the Cohen testi-mony. Donald Trump\u2019s\nformer personal attorney\nand \u201cfixer\u201d voluntarily\nappeared before the\nHouse yesterday in an\nopen hearing. His testimony directly implicates\nTrump Jr., Roger Stone,\nas well as Trump himself\nin conspiracy to commit\nbank and tax fraud, among\nother improprietous\nactions (including participation in \u201ccatch-and-kill\u201d\nschemes, and several\nallegations of flagrantly\nracist remarks out of\nTrump\u2019s mouth \u2013 such as\n\u201cName one country run\nby a black man that\u2019s not\na shithole\u201d).\nMost of the spice is in\nthe prewritten statement.\nThe questioning was\nmostly grandstanding.\nRepublicans hilariously\ntried to paint Cohen as\na \u201cliar\u201d unworthy of\ncongressional testimony\n(Trump\u2019s lied at least 8200\ntimes since taking office).\nDemocrats, on the whole,\nfailed to ask substantive\nquestions. Special creds\nto AOC for a properly\nprosecutorial cross-exam-ination towards the end.\nOtherwise, tune in for a\ngood view of just how\ninane American politics\ncan get.\nOver the next few\nweeks \u2013 more humdrum\nsquabbling, more Dem\noversight. Looks like\nTrump Jr. will be charged\nnext. The Democrat\nprimary field will evolve;\nBernie will consolidate\nhis lead or start to flame\nout. So long as India and\nPakistan don\u2019t bomb each\nother, presumably, we\u2019ll\nbe back next week.\nAlas, I ascend to the\nKingdom of Heaven,\nwhere I shall partake copiously in my own blood,\nand play darts with thun-derbolts, aiming to strike\ndown Henry Kissinger.\n\u201cThis two-step\nrecipe quickly\nbuilds a failed\nstate.\u201d\nT\nhe LSE Festival,\nrunning from\n25 February to\n2 March, is a\nweek-long series of events\naimed at engaging the\npublic with social science\nhot topics. This year\u2019s\ntheme is New World\n(Dis)Orders and focuses\non the changing global\nsituation: a new emergent\nworld order where the US\nis no longer the biggest\nworld power; rapidly-de-veloping technology and\nits implications for our\ndemocracy; the politics\nthat shape our interpretation of the world...\nAs part of the LSE\nFestival, the LSE Global\nHealth Initiative hosted a\npanel on February 26 addressing a major question\nabout antibiotic resistance\npolicy: how can we\nreshape existing global\nhealthcare structures, and\ncoordinate international\nand interdisciplinary\naction, to combat new\nantibiotic resistance\ndangers? The panel,\ntitled \u201cThe Drugs Aren\u2019t\nWorking! Confronting\nthe Crisis of Superbugs\u201d\nprovided broad view into\na scientific crisis whose\nsolutions lie largely in\npolicy and regulation.\nThe panel consisted of\nprofessionals from International Development,\nHealth Policy, Government, and International\nRelations backgrounds,\neach offering solutions\nto the crisis from their\ndisciplinary perspective,\nresulting in a comprehensive analysis of this\npolicy-science crisis\nintersection.\nFrom a healthy policy\nperspective, for instance,\na panelist argued that the\nissue of antimicrobial\nresistance (AMR) is\ntoo interdisciplinary for\ngovernment plans to be\neasily implemented. This\nis despite the estimate that\ninvestments of USD$2 per\nperson per year would be\nenough to prevent 75% of\nthe related deaths, costing\nmuch less than the World\nBank estimate of antibiotic resistance costing\nthe global economy\nUSD$100 trillion by\n2050. Why is investment\ninto AMR treatment so\ndifficult? The International Development panelist\ncontends that investment\ninto drug development\nis inadequate because\nthe usual incentives for\npharmaceuticals to create\ndrugs do not apply to\nAMR. Antibiotics cannot\nbe stockpiled, and must\nbe made universally\naccessible for widespread\ntreatment, making it\nunlikely that pharmaceutical companies can\nearn back a profit from\nthe expensive process of\ndeveloping drugs.\nOther than panels, the\nLSE Festival includes an\nexhibition and prize-giv-ing ceremony of an LSE\nstudent and staff social\nscience research com-petition. These entries\nare on show in the form\nof posters, photographs,\nand research abstracts.\nEntries cover a vast range\nof subjects, from \u201cChina\u2019s\nTwo-Faced Rhetoric\u201d to\nLSE Festival \u2013 An Exhibition of Policy and\nSocial Science Research\nPOLITICS\nIsabelle Zhang\nPolitics Writer\n\u201cPolicing of Live Music in\nEngland and Wales\u201d. Film\nscreenings, live debates,\nchild-friendly events, and\nstudent-led drama performances are also part of the\nfestival program.\nMore information\nabout the Festival and\navailable events held on\nits last day (tomorrow, 2\nMarch) and the research\ncompetition exhibition\ncan be found on the LSE\nEvents website. Entry to\nall events are free but may\nrequire booking ahead.\nThe event looks for solutions to tackle the problems affecting the planet in the 21st century.\n\n"

And\nit didn\u2019t just sound great;\nconsidering the context of\nthe release (her first album\nreleased after a terrorist\nattack at her Manchester\nconcert which left 27\npeople dead), the lyrics\nand song topics displayed\nsurprising strength and\npositivity. The release\nalso took place only a\nfew months after her\nbreakup with rapper Mac\nMiller, her boyfriend of\ntwo years, over concerns\nwith his worsening substance abuse problems.\nConsidering the turmoil\nof the preceding year,\nthe emotional tone of\nSweetener was celebratory and inspiring; even\nthe songs about her pain\nwere made optimistic and\nhopeful.\nNot only did Sweetener\ncontain songs demonstrating a mature and healthy\napproach to dealing with\nthe trauma of the past year,\nit also featured a handful\nof incredibly gorgeous\nand heartfelt love songs\ndedicated to her new\nfianc\u00e9, Pete Davidson.\nHer infatuation was clear\nin a number of tracks\n(including one named\nafter him), and the potent\nmix of lovely production\nand moments of lyrical\ntenderness (take \u201cmy\nwhole life got me ready\nfor you\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m tryna\nturn two single people\ninto a couple\u201d) combined\nto create a euphoric\natmosphere that showed\nthat, after a painful year,\neverything was promising\nto work out.\nTragically, shortly\nafter the release, things\nfell apart. A month later,\nMac Miller died of a\ndrug overdose - only\nfour months after their\nbreakup. Another month\nlater, Ariana\u2019s engagement was over.\nOne might have predicted that there would\nbe a long wait before\nnew music was released.\nNobody could have\nguessed that, only a month\nafter the end of her en-gagement, Ariana would\nrelease a song showcasing\na staggering amount of\nstrength and maturity.\nIt really can\u2019t be overstated how incredibly\npositive and decorous\nthat song, \u2018thank u, next\u2019,\nreally is. In the track,\nshe names her previous\npartners, thanking them\nindividually for making\nher who she is now.\nGoing as far as to directly\nname Pete and Mac in\nthe opening lines is both\nbrave and sad, showcasing impressive emotional\nmaturity and warmth of\nspirit. The song took over\nthe radio, and I would\nargue that a significant\npart of the success was\ndue to the genre-defying\nsincerity, honesty and\nemotional intelligence of\nthe song. Many pop songs\nare reductive, cynically\nproduced for mass-appeal;\nhere is a song that sounds\nmore like emotional\nhealing, showcasing\nbravery and soul-bearing\nrarely heard in the Top 40.\nAfter this, the album\nwas announced, surprising considering how\nrecently Sweetener was\nreleased. And it\u2019s even\nmore surprising that, considering the short timespan between releases\nand the undeniable trauma\nof the past six months,\nAriana has released an\nalbum that is so good.\nIt understandably feels\nmore emotionally vulnerable than Sweetener, with\nmore songs showcasing\nclear heartbreak and pain.\nAnd unlike Sweetener,\nwhere new love provided\nthe antidote to pain, here\nthe turmoil is ridden out\nalone. Without distraction\nand infatuation providing relief, Ariana finds\ncomfort in herself, from\nwithin rather than without.\nAnd it is this self-reliance\nthat makes the album even\nmore inspiring.\nUnlike Sweetener,\nwhere Pharrell\u2019s (unde-niably fun) production\nclashed with the few songs\nproduced by other artists,\ncreating a disjointed and\nconfused overall sound,\nthe production here is\nconsistent, and coheres\nto paint the picture of a\nperson going through the\nrises and falls in emotion\nessentialforhealing.There\nare moments of extreme\nsadness, followed by a\ngradual build in strength\nand confidence, and then\nagain followed by a crash\nin spirits. It feels realistic\nand cathartic, as if this\naccurately reflects the\nemotional journey Ariana\nhas been through.\nWhere Sweetener\nfeatured a small handful\nof unnecessary songs, and\nsome which were great\nbut self-contained, with\ntopics that didn\u2019t contribute to an overall narrative,\nthank u, next contains\nno filler, and every song\nfeeds into the story of a\nperson navigating through\ntrauma. In addition to\nconsistent production\nand lyrical content, this\nis also the first album\nwhere Ariana is the only\nfeatured vocalist, again\ncontributing to a cohesive\nand consistent sound.\nIn addition to containing no unnecessary tracks,\nthere are a number of\nfantastic ones. \u2018imagine\u2019\nis a gorgeous and wistful\nalbum opener, \u2018fake smile\u2019\nhas jaw dropping bridges\nand choruses, \u2018ghostin\u2019 is\nthe heart-breaking emotional nadir of the album,\n\u2018in my head\u2019 is somehow\nboth crushingly sad and\nhopeful. And that\u2019s not\neven mentioning the\nexcellent singles released\nto promote the album; the\ninescapable title track, \u20187\nrings\u2019 and \u2018break up with\nyour boyfriend\u2019 are all\ngreat, with the latter providing a light-hearted end\nto the album. The only\nsong I personally think\nfalters is \u2018bloodline\u2019, and\neven so my main issue is\nwith the cheap-sounding\nhorns; other than that\nit\u2019s another great song\nthat contributes to the\nnarrative of the album,\nand would be missed if\ndeleted.\nSweetener was a great\nalbum with a number\nof fantastic songs but a\nslightly confused message\nand sound. thank u, next\ntakes death and heartbreak\nand creates art, an album\nchronicling emotional\nturmoil and ascension\nfrom despair to a place of\nstoicism and sanity, in a\nsimilar vein to Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s\nexcellent Lemonade.\nAriana takes extreme\npain and transfigures it\ninto something beautiful,\ncomplex and worthwhile.\nUpside down, boy, you turn me inside out and round and round // Republic\nMUSIC\nAlex Large\nMusic Writer\nArtist: Ariana Grande.\nLabel: Republic. Top\nTracks: literally everything\nexcept \u2018bloodline\u2019. For Fans\nOf: Straight up good pop\nmusic. 41 minutes\nTHANK U, NEXT\n\n"

After a mixed\nset of results in the poules\nthe first self-elimination\narose - Filip had drawn\nLouis in the round of 128.\nFilip won the bout 15-8\nand proceeded to come\n16th overall.\nAnother self-elimina-tion was on the horizon as\nJames (last year\u2019s bronze\nmedallist) fenced our\nstrongest epeeist Harry in\nthe round of 32. The bout\nfinished 15-8 to Harry\nwho finished in 6th.\nMeanwhile in Women\u2019s\nSabre, Fran (an epeeist by\ntraining), was progressing\nvery well in her second\nweapon, finishing 13th\noverall. The remaining\nfencers joined everyone\nin Sheffield that night\nwith many enjoying some\nexcellent competition\npreparation with a night\nout in Sheffield\u2026\nThe second day saw\nthe Women\u2019s Foilists and\nMen\u2019s Sabreurs compete.\nA tough round of poules\nlead to our 3rd self-elim-ination when Michael\nfaced Filip in the round\nof 128. Filip, possibly still\ninebriated, managed to\nwin the very close match\nwith a final score of 13-15.\nFilip won the next round\nas well after a quick nap,\nfinishing 32nd overall.\nWomen\u2019s foil had\nonly two entrants from\nImperial - one unfortunately didn\u2019t make it\npast the group stage but\nAilsa, unencumbered by\nthe thought of having to\nfence an Imperial student,\nfenced a strong last 32\nmatch before finishing\n14th, being knocked out\nby the eventual winner.\nThe third day was our\nfinal chance of medals in\nMen\u2019s Foil and Women\u2019s\nEpee. During the poules,\nAaron, our best foilist,\nonly conceded 2 hits\n(and scored 25) ranking\n2nd going into the direct\nelimination round. This\nled to the 4th Imperial\nself-elimination of the\nweekend as Peter ranked\n63rd faced Aaron in the\nround of 64 - Aaron won\nthe bout 15-3.\nIn the Women\u2019s Epee,\nboth Roc\u00edo and Fran got\nto the last 16 but were\nknocked out in closely\nfought matches with\nRoc\u00edo finishing highest in\n10th place.\nBack to Men\u2019s Foil\nand all other Imperial\nfencers were out, meaning\nAaron was our last hope\nof a medal. A very close\nquarter final bout saw\nAaron come back from\n10-13 down to win 15-14,\nfollowed by a more\nstraight forward semi-final\nwin, guaranteeing himself\na silver medal. The final\nwas close fought to start,\nbut 3 minutes in, Aaron\u2019s\ncramp caught up with him\nand a brief medical break\nwas required. He fought\non valiantly but after a\nlong tough day, gained\nsecond place. losing the\nfinal 15-9.\nDespite some unlucky\ndraws and tough matches,\nthe fencers should be\nproud of their fencing and\ntheir fantastic support and\ncoaching of each other.\nReturning a silver medal\nwas an excellent end to\nthe weekend, and a result\nto beat next year!\nParries, pancakes and parties in Paris\nE\nveryyearinParis,\nthe Challenge\nX-Systra \u2013 a student run fencing\ncompetition organized by\nthe \u00c9cole Polytechnique\n\u2013 hosts students from all\nover Europe. Those who\nlove the sport don\u2019t shy\naway from a three hour\ntrain, and so, this year\nwent eighteen Imperial\nCollege Fencing Club\nmembers to Palaiseau,\nParis.\nIf it was already cold\nin London, it had nothing\non the snow-covered\ncampus in Palaiseau.\nThose who love the sport\nalso don\u2019t shy away from\nclimbing up a deathly hill\ndragging equipment and\nsuitcases behind, because\nain\u2019t nobody got time (or\nmoney) for an Uber.\nOn Friday, the individual events began. After a\nlong day of pancakes (and\nsome fencing), the results\nwere as follows: Women\u2019s\nfoil - Marie Obrowski\n34th, Eshaya Lim 28th;\nMen\u2019s foil - Marcel\nBuen 38th, Ben Fry 31st;\nWomen\u2019s epee - Georgie\nStroud 15th, Carolina\nColagrossi 13th; Men\u2019s\nepee - Rohan Kamath\n50th, Kirill Khraponichev\n41st, Zoltan Hanesz 19th;\nWomen\u2019s sabre - Grace\nCollins 19th, Sherry\nXu 6th; Men\u2019s Sabre)Nicholas Walker 43rd,\nRaymond Wang 30th,\nEmre Ozer 28th, David\nDai 22nd, Apostolos Panagiotopoulos 16th.\nOn Saturday, the team\nevents were on. The best\npart about team events\nwere the names of teams:\nImperial Collage, Imperial\nStormtroopers, Caught off\nguard, The Three Moustiquaires... The Women\nSabre\u2019s team final saw\nUnisport Austria against\nMost Likely Toulouse,\nincluding fencers from\nKings and our very own\nSherry Xu.\nThe two teams fought\nvaliantly \u2013 every time the\nboard lit up, the audience\nwould hold their breath,\nwaiting for the judge\u2019s\nruling. When the right\nhand would lift, a roaring\ncheer would erupt from\nthe seats, with many\nrooting for Most Likely\nToulouse.\nThe last bout saw the\npoints raise to 44\u201342 for\nMost Likely Toulouse.\nThe excitement in the\nroom was almost unbear-able, but Most Likely\nToulouse surprised the\nopposition with a last\nsecond retreat and counterattack to win the match!\nThat night the partying\nwas strong with the\nImperial fencers, who\ncelebrated bringing home\na team gold medal by\nmaking the most of the\nopen bar and fireworks\u2026\nSPORTS\nBen Fry\nIC Fencing Vice President\nSPORTS\nCarolina Colagrossi\nIC Fencing Webmaster\nSmiling with silver // IC Fencing\nISSUE 1716\nFELIX\nSPORTS sport.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n37\nLooking fine, after all the cheap wine // IC Fencing\n\n"

On the one hand,\none of our delegates\ndeclared his character a\ngod, which resulted in\nhis untimely death, while\nour other elf character\ndelegate managed to\nrestore the kingdom of\nMirkwood after rising up\nthe ranks from a viceroy\nto a high elven king.\nFinally, the side of good\nprevailed against Sauron\u2019s\narmy thanks to the dwarf\nbetrayal of Sauron (yes,\nyou read that right) at the\nend of what was a fulfilling and certainly special\nweekend.\nMost of us were new\nto this new kind of con-ference, but we indeed\nmanaged to perform\nvery well: with one\nbest delegate award, a\ncommendation and, most\nimportantly, only one\nloss suffered (I know,\nit sounds weird saying\nthis). Our experience was\nyet another example of\nhow ICMUN delegations\ncan leave a mark in these\nconferences.\nTo find out more about\nICMUN, visit us every\nThursday from 6 to 8pm\nin Huxley 308, check our\nFacebook page or email\nmodelun@ic.ac.uk\n\u201cOne delegate\nwas killed\ntwice one the\nsame day, as\ntwo different\ncharacters\u201d\nMorgan.\nIn contrast to the\nprevious two crises, the\nAlgerian War Committee\nwas particularly bloody\n(one delegate was killed\ntwice on the same day, as\ntwo different characters).\nOur delegate managed to\nstay alive as the Algerian\nminister Lakhdar Ben\nTobbal, while organising\nthe resistance against the\nFrench army. Although\nthere were many successful killings, including that\nof President De Gaulle,\na truce brought forward\nby the French had to be\naccepted. Nevertheless,\nthe conclusion was quite\nshocking, as the enemy\nmanaged to build a\nnuclear bomb which was\nlaunched on Algiers. A\ndrastic decision which,\nhad the conference contin-ued, could have favoured\nthe Algerian cause: our\ndelegate was ready with\npart of the army to coun-terattack, so who knows\nhow it could have ended?\nA\ndelegation of the\nICMUN society\ntook part in the\nLSEMUN, held\non the main campus at\nLSE in early February.\nThis is different than most\nof the MUN conferences\nas it\u2019s completely focused\non Crisis committees, an\nunusual and slightly underrated \u2018mode\u2019in MUNs.\nIn Crisis, delegates don\u2019t\nrepresent countries or international organisations,\nbut individual people in\nvarious historical or fictional contexts; everything\nis based on your ability to\ndevise a good strategy to\nachieve your goals and\nreact to random events\nthat can easily stop your\nrise to power. People\nin the same cabinet\ncooperate and usually\nhave a common purpose.\nHowever, betrayals are\nfrequent and everyone\nshould always watch\ntheir back to survive (yes,\ncharacters can be fiction-ally killed): your number\nof choices is limitless, as\nlong as you communicate\nyour clear strategy to the\nChairs - those that run the\ncommittee.\nFor example, as one\nof the conspirators in\nthe 1605 Gunpowder\nplot, our delegate ingratiated himself with\nthe king, then faked his\nown death, hoping to\nlure King James to the\nfuneral of a casket full of\ngunpowder. However, a\ntraitor betrayed us to the\nCrown\u2019s spies and the\nking sent a body double.\nYet all was not lost. King\nJames, now embold-ened, attended the state\nopening of Parliament the\nfollowing day and, with\nmore gunpowder stashed\nbelow the House of Lords,\nwas blown up. Funnily\nenough, due to a miscom-munication between spies,\nan innocent greengrocer\nwas accidentally blown\nup also.\nIn the EU Parliamentary Elections Committee,\nour delegate represented\nTsipras, who was nominated as the spitzenkan-didat for the GUE/NGL\ngroup and campaigned\nalong Frederica Mogherini, the nominee of the\nSocial Democrats (S&D)\nfor the same position.\nThe far-right ENF gained\nthe largest number of\nseats, but it was left out of\npower because the S&D\nabandoned the GUE party\nto combine forces with\nthe EPP, resulting in a\nhost of centrists assuming\nthe top posts in the Commission. While someone\nmanufactured a scandal\nabout Nigel Farage and\nSilvio Berlusconi hanging\nout in a brothel, which\nled to the now famous\nhashtag #NaughtyNigel,\nPablo Iglesias and Tsipras\ndecided to support the\nENF\u2019s candidates as a\nprotest vote against the\nSocial Democrats who\ndecided to betray them.\nAnother real-life House\nof Cards episode took\nplace in the Financial\nCrisis Committee, where\nour delegate managed\nto imprison some of the\nworld\u2019s most important\nCEOs as part of investigations following the\n2008 crisis. Fast-forward\nand the role of District\nAttorney was changed to\nFBI Director, leading to\nmeddling with internal\nelections, thanks to some\nforeign countries, in\norder to make Obama\nlose the 2012 elections\nto the former CEO of JP\nMiddle Earth, 2019, colourised //ICMUN\nImperial College Choir\nSpring Concert - Mozart\nRequiem and Haydn Te\nDeum\nI\nmperial College Choir is one of Imperial\u2019s\nlargest choirs with over 100 members, including both staff and students.

Unfortunately\nwe had a lull where CSM\nscored their first 3 goals.\nBut this didn\u2019t stop us, we\nmanaged to turn the ball\naround and, for the first\ntime in four years, scored\nA\nfter the \u2018true\u2019\nCSM badminton team (in\nwhichonly2out\nof 6 players were miners\n(GEOGRAPHERS)) won\nthe trophy last year, this\nyear, CSM surprisingly\nbothered to send their\nactual team (of course,\na NO-MINER team) to\nLondon. However, neither\nwaking up at 5.30am nor\na 6-hour drive demolished\ntheir excellent racket skills\nand superb footwork.\nOnce again, CSM\nre-emphasized their dom-game began. The RSM\nsupporters had witnessed\nunfortunate losses the\nday before and the RSM\nLacrosse team were eager\nto give them a good performance and win to start\nthe day correctly. Their\nanswers were swiftly answered as the CSM cheers\nwere almost instantly\nextinguished - 3 goals\nwere scored by the RSM\nin the early minutes due to\nsome great drawing from\nArianna.\nThe first quarter ended\nwith an excellent 6-1\nscore line to the RSM. The\nsecond and third quarter\ncontinued in a similar\nfashion, with the highlight\nbeing a great pass from\nArianna almost half the\npitch up to Claudia who\nquickly scored after taking\nthe ball on the crease.\nGoals from Arianna,\nAnnie and Matthew\nduring this period led to a\ncommanding 12-4 lead to\nthe RSM by the end of the\n3rd quarter. At this point,\nhowever, it seemed as if\nCSM had suddenly discovered some newfound\nenergy as the RSM team\nlost some vital players to\nhockey and they quickly\nrallied, scoring 2 goals\npast an increasingly angry\nRSM Goalkeeper.

Some\nrogue chanting from\na couple of unnamed\nex-players (one has a\nblack eye, the other an\nunfathomable enjoyment\nof a port shower), kept the\nCSM players on their toes,\nhowever the first big save\nof the game was pulled\noff by RSM\u2019s resident cat\nJamie Stringer, tipping a\nheader over the top of the\nbar after a rare breach of\ntheir otherwise rock solid\ndefence.\nThe second half saw\nthe game open up, with\nMickey Yu complaining\nof a cricked neck as he\npanned his camera from\nend to end. Captain for the\nday Matthew Campbell\nthought he\u2019d grabbed the\nheadlines when stroking\nthe ball into an empty net\nafter a fumble from the\nCSM keeper, although unfortunately he\u2019d forgotten\nthat kicking the ball out a\ngoalie\u2019s hands is illegal....\nThis sparked a memorable\ncelebration from RSM\u2019s\nyesterday man Lekan\nOgunlana, executing\nrepeated straight drives\nwith yard in hand before\nbeing cruelly escorted off\nthe pitch.\nThe introduction of\nthe rapid Jake Bluston\nstretched the CSM\ndefence, and he proved\nto be the match winner in\nthe 87th minute, chasing\na delightfully chipped-through ball over the top\nto hold off the centre back\nand slot past the keeper.\nThe post goal celebratory\nscenes were a blur, with\nmany hoarse voices still\nstruggling to tell the tale.\nAfter a summer of nearly\u2019s, Football has finally come\nhome...\n12 6\nRSM CSM\nV\nFootball\nCAME HOME\nSPORTS\nTom Hughes\nRSM Football Captain\n5 minutes of stress\nfollowed, with some back\nto the wall defending\nensuring the clean sheet\nremained intact.

At 2/1\ndown in the tie, 3rd string\nEric Newland needed to\nwin to keep RSM hopes\nalive but was defeated in\nthree tight games by an\nexperienced opponent.\nWith the match gone,\nsome pride was restored\nas our team captain and 1st\nstring blitzed his opposite\nnumber 3/0, leaving the\nfinal match score at 3-2\nto CSM. With a packed\ngallery and a great atmos-phere, the Friday squash\nfuelled enthusiasm for the\nrest of the weekend sport,\nhere\u2019s to hoping it stays\nfor next year!\ninance of the trophy.\nAlthough the trophy is\nstill out there waiting to\nbe brought home, RSM\ndid much better this year.\nNot only did we finally\nhave our personalised\nteam shirts on, but we\nalso managed to win 2\nmatches, with the final\nscore 8-2 to CSM. Despite\nthe fact that RSM players\nwere only paired up 2\nweeks before, all three\npairs fought extremely\nhard with good spirits and\nsportsmanship.\nThe RSM team, un-doubtedly, enjoyed the\nshort 45-min game (which\nwas equivalent to the\nexercise of 3 normal RSM\nsessions) and displayed\nsome fairly close games\nfor spectators to enjoy.\nWe all have faith that next\nyear RSM Badminton will\nbe crowned champions in\nBottle Match and bring\nthe trophy back!\nFalmouth players, against\nour RSM-ers, our brave\nbattle was no match.\nThe RSM team\nmanaged to sneak past the\nCSM-ers many times but\na skillful GK on the part\nof the CSM scuppered\nchances at closing the\nscore gap. This, along\nwith an inhumanly\naccurate CSM GS, meant\nthat the game was CSM\ndominated. With this\nbeing said, the goals that\nwere scored by the RSM\nwere met with wild cheers\nfrom the RSM support.\nBy the end of the match,\nCSM remained the victors\nof the Bottle Match and\nthe Netball win eluded us\nfor one more year. Despite\nthis, the home crowd,\nhomemade flags, banners,\nand of course those trusty\nmegaphones kept the\nmorale high and CSM-ers\naware of the fight that the\nRSM were going to bring\nfor the rest of the Bottle\nMatch weekend.\n\n"

    "content": "ISSUE 1716\nFELIX\n6\nPOLITICS felix@imperial.ac.uk\nLabelling The Independent Group MPs\n\u201ctraitors\u201d is exactly why they left\nThere is a powerful rationale for the actions of the 8 Labour MPs that left the party last week\nPOLITICS\nCalum Drysdale\nPolitics Writer\nW\nhen The\nIndependent\nGroup MPs\nleft, they\nwere in disgust at the state\nof their own parties. Let\nus consider the personal\ntoll this must have taken.\nMany MPs grew up\nknowing that they wanted\nto be in politics, and what\nparty they wanted to be\na part of. They will have\nspent years working in\nsmall dingy rooms as\nresearchers, walking\nmiles a day canvassing,\nand putting on smile after\nsmile on the campaign\ntrail. Why did they do\nthat? Don\u2019t tell me that it\nwas just power lust. These\npeople believed, rightly or\nwrongly, that they could\nmake our country a better\nplace. They believed\nin their cause and they\nbelieved in their party. So\nput yourself in their shoes,\njust for a second, and imagine how hard it would\nhave been for them to turn\ntheir backs on everything\nthat they had built. Why\nwould they do that? The\nconduct of some Labour\nsupporters provides us\nwith an insight into how\nfar our two major parties\nhave fallen.\nLast week, published\nin these very pages, was\na tub-thumping condemnation of the actions of\nthe 8 labour MPs that\nchose to leave. The article\nclaims that their departure\nis \u201cgood riddance\u201d and\nmakes a number of other\nextraordinary and, in some\ncases, false statements. I\nfear the author has drunk\ntoo deeply from the well of\nideology. I hope to offer a\nhumble refutation to some\nof his more egregious\nclaims and, potentially,\nrestore some balance to\nthis conversation.\nOne of the tragedies of\nthe decline of the Labour\nparty is that its former\ntolerance and inclusivity\nproved to be the root of\nits transformation into the\nbitter and twisted party\nobsessed with ideological\npurity that we see today.\nCorbyn has been a Labour\nMP since 1983, and, when\nhis party was in govern-ment, he voted against\nthem 428 times. Yet, he\nwas still accepted. It was\naccepted that Labour was\nhome to those on the\nleft and, while the more\ncentrist leadership at the\ntime did not agree with\nhim, they never threatened to chase him out of\nthe party or to deselect\nhim as an MP.\nIndeed, the irony of\nCorbynites condemning\nChuka Umunna as having\nbetrayed the party that\ngot him elected, is compounded by a tweet from\nCorbyn himself. In 2010,\nwhen power was nowhere\nin sight, Corbyn wrote \u201cu\nvote 4 ur MP\u201d. Now that\nthe boot is on the other\nfoot, it seems such values\nhave swiftly faded away.\nForgetfulness regarding uncomfortable truths\nseems to be a trend as the\narticle goes on. \u201c[7 Labour\nMPs] took the unprecedented step of leaving the\nLabour party and forming\na new centrist \u2018party\u2019,\ntaking the incredibly bland\nname \u2018The Independent\nGroup\u2019\u201d. In one sentence,\nhe brushes over historic\nparty schisms, such as the\nLabour MPs that left to\nform the SDP, he is guilty\nof misleading the reader\nby saying MPs have\nformed a party - a position\nhe repeats despite later\nacknowledging it is false\nand adds a pejorative slur\nthat says more about the\nintolerance rife in Labour\nthan anything else.\nIf these are your voters\nand party members,\nthen I have sympathy\nwith Umunna and others\nwhen they looked across\nthe aisle and joined\nwith Conservatives who\nshared in their values of\n\u201c[reducing inequality]\nthrough the extension\nof opportunity\u201d and\n\u201c[creating] fairer, more\nprosperous communities\u201d\nrather than engaging is\nopen anti-Semitism.\nI know that this is\na claim that will rouse\nDo I believe that The\nIndependent Group is\nperfect? No. Of course\nnot. It has been rightfully\npointed out that saying\nthat people of colour have\na \u201cfunny tinge\u201d is not a\ngreat way to start off. I\nbelieve that she should\nface investigation and\npotentially expulsion. But\nI think the author makes\na mistake typical of the\nblinkered state that many\nJez supporters exist in. We\ndo not need our parties to\nbe completely ideologically pure. We need them\nto represent our interests\nand the fact that, despite\n72% of Labour members\nsupporting a second\nreferendum on Brexit,\nonly the threat of more\ndefections has convinced\nCorbyn to back a People\u2019s\nVote shows that Labour\nvoters have forgotten this.\nThe author writes that\nThe Independent Group\nis just \u201canother regressive Third Way tribute\nact from the 90s\u201d. The\ntragedy is that he hasn\u2019t\nnoticed, too busy insulting other people, that his\nown party has turned into\na bad hangover from the\n70s. Maybe we could do\na bit less mudslinging and\na bit more talking about\npolicy?\nA new party in town. // The Daily Echo\nmany people but it is\none that I will stand by.\nCorbyn has a history of\nbeing anti-Semitic and it\nis on his watch that the\nparty has become a place\nwhere Jewish people are\nnot welcome. If you are in\nany doubt over this, I refer\nyou to the incident in 2012\nwhen Corbyn protested\nthe removal of a mural of\na group of Jewish caricatures playing Monopoly,\nthe board resting on the\nnaked backs of faceless\nmen. I, however, prefer\nto listen to the Jewish\nBritons themselves who\nhave expressed time and\ntime again that they are\nbeing targeted. If Corbyn\nbecame PM, almost 40%\nof Jews would consider\nleaving Britain and The\nJewish Chronicle writes\n\u201cCorbyn threat is much\ngreater than far right\u201d.\n\n"

In\nfact, the Icelandic government is struggling to\ncontrol the burgeoning\ntourism industry as more\nand more curious tourists\nmake their way to the\nlone nation island to find\nout what the hype is all\nabout. While Iceland has\na lot of charming popular\nlocations scattered around\nthe island, especially the\nsouth coast, a lot of visitors are still oblivious to\nan enchanted region that is\nhidden in plain sight, the\nSn\u00e6fellsnes Peninsula.\nLocated just north of\nand lava caves, the peninsula has the most varied\nattractions compared\nto any other regions in\nthe country. Because of\nits convenient location,\nmany travel companies\nin Iceland offer assorted\ntour packages for the pen-insula, though they have\nvarying attractions listed.\nWhile you can find\nmultiple black beach spots\nin Iceland, Sn\u00e6fellsnes\u2019\nvery own Dj\u00fapal\u00f3nssandur black pebble beach\nis truly distinctive as it\nis decorated with unique\nrock formations from the\nlava field near the beach.\nAs with other black\nbeaches found in Iceland,\nit is also one of the well-known locations in Icelandic sagas and folklore for\ntrolls and the Hulduf\u00f3lks,\nIceland\u2019s version of elves.\nIt is believed that the rock\nformations belong to the\nbodies of trolls that were\nturned into stones when\nexposed to sunlight.\nWhen visiting the\nSn\u00e6fellsnes peninsula,\nthe breathtaking Sn\u00e6fellsj\u00f6kull will most likely be\nin the backdrop throughout the journey, looming\nover the peninsula as if it\ncommands control over it.\nIndeed, the glacier-capped\nstratovolcano, located\nin the similarly-named\nSn\u00e6fellsj\u00f6kull National\nPark, serves as the main\nattraction of the whole\npeninsula.

Robert\nKiyosaki said that the subprime Morgage Backed\nSecurity (MBS) disaster\nwas a result of them\n\u201cexploding in financial\ninstitutions such as AIG\nand Lehman Brothers\u201d.\nSo, what exactly are\nderivatives?\nA derivative is a\nfinancial security with a\nvalue that is dependent\nor derived from an\nunderlying group of\nassets. The derivative\nitself is a contract between\ntwo ore more parties with\nits price determined by\nthe fluctuations of the\nunderlying asset. The\nunderlying asset can be\nanything from stocks,\nbonds and commodities\nto even interest rates\nand market indexes.\nMost derivatives are\ntraded over-the-counter\n(OTC), since they are\nmostly unique and\nunstandardized. However,\nsome standardised\nderivatives feature on\nexchanges, but they\nare more regulated.\nEssentially, they were\ncreated as a means of\nhedging risk (reduce risk\nfaced by organisations\nand individuals). There\nare two main derivative\ntypes used in the financial\nindustry; futures and\noptions. Futures are\nfinancial contracts\nobligating the buyer\nto purchase an asset\nor the seller to sell an\nasset, most commonly a\nphysical commodity or\nfinancial instrument, at a\npredetermined future date\nand price. Options are\nsold by an option writer\nmethod may involve\na high degree of risk\nand usually have short\nholding periods, it is\noften more attractive\nthan the underlying asset\nbecause the contracts\ncan be highly geared. Put\nsimply, this means that a\nsmall expenditure gives\nthe holder a big exposure\nto the market. This leads\nthe investor with the\npotential for large profits\nbut also large losses. It\nis this speculation that\ndominates criticism of\nthe derivatives market.\nBefore the financial\ncrash of 2008, the Credit\nDefault Swap (a special\ntype of derivative) market\nwas over 20 times larger\nthan the market for the\nunderlying security,\nMortgage Backed\nSecurities.There have also\nbeen numerous occasions\nin which derivatives have\nbeen used to gamble on\nbankrupt companies.\nAkshay Shah, previous\nmanaging director at the\nBlackstone\u2019s GSO hedge\nfund unit, terrorised\nEuropean credit markets\nby spearheading a series\nof unconventional trades\nusing derivatives. His\nsecret formula involved:\nGSO buying a Credit\nDefaultSwapcontractona\nstruggling company from\nanother hedge fund. The\nCDS is like an insurance\ncontract: it pays out if the\ncompany defaults\nGSO then approaches\nthe company and offers it\nvery attractive financing\n(a low interest loan for\nexample) with an unusual\ncondition: it must default\nin a way that will trigger\na pay-out on the CDS\ncontract.\nThe company carries\nout this proposal, for\nexample by paying\ninterest on a bond a few\ndays late, causing little\nconcern to bondholders\nbut \u201ctriggering\u201d the CDS\ncontracts.\nThe hedge fund then\nhas to pay a lump sum to\nGSO given the company\nhas defaulted.\nDespite the negative\nto an option buyer. They\nare typically purchased\nthrough brokers. The\ncontract offers the buyer\nthe right, but not the\nobligation to buy (call\noption) or sell (put option)\nthe underlying asset at an\nagreed future price during\na certain period of time or\non a specific date. There\nare many different types\nof option from lookback\noption, which is path\ndependent option where\nthe option owner has\nthe right to buy or sell at\nthe lowest price over a\nperiod, to a binary option,\nin which the contract pays\na fixed amount or nothing\nat all. The type of option\nused wholly depends\non the needs of the two\nparties.\nMost derivatives are\nused to hedge risk. The\ncontracts can guard\ninvestors against adverse\nprice movements. A\nhedger seeks to protect\na position in the sport\nmarket by taking an\nopposite position in\nthe derivatives market.\nHowever, derivatives can\nbe used for speculation.\nSpeculators take a view\non the market\u2019s direction\nand seek to make a profit\nfrom price movements by\nbuying or selling futures\ncontracts. Although this\nBank of England governor Mark Carney, second left, talks about the US-UK deal in London on Monday// FT\nDerivatives lead to the bailout of isurance firm AIG// Business Insurance\nWhat are derivatives and how are they used?\naspect of this type of\nfinancial product, they are\nstill a key lubricant in the\nglobal financial industry.\nRecently the UK and US\nmarket regulators have\nfinalised a sweeping long-term agreement to jointly\noversee each other\u2019s\nderivatives market,\nproviding a \u201cbridge over\nBrexit\u201d that removes\nconcern of turmoil in the\nevent of a no deal Brexit.\nThe deal will mitigate any\nrisk of huge disruption to\nbanks and institutional\ninvestors who are\ndependent on derivative\ncontracts to hedge against\nmovements in interest\nrates, currencies and\ncommodities.\n\n"

You need a DPW that can provide this, and I have the experience, passion\nand drive to ensure this happens.\nObjectives:\n\u2022 Ensure the Wellbeing Strategy is fully-funded, resourced and delivered\nby College across all campuses.\n\u2022 Cut counselling waiting times and review the missed appointments policy.\n\u2022 Subsidise tampons/sanitary products further\n\u2022 Stop talking about personal tutors and make changes\n\u2022 Support student-led, liberation and community officer campaigns\n\u2022 Collect student suggestions/complaints using an anonymous online\nsystem\n\u2022 More training, support and development for Wellbeing Representation\nNetwork volunteers\n\u2022 Ensure freshers receive adequate information regarding self-care, welfare,\nwell-being and where to find help regardless of where they live.\n\u2022 Run union-wide Mums and Dads events\nsors that end up taking up the majority of your time, to minor administrative\ntasks which can easily build up. You may also be met with more opposition\nthan you had anticipated, or find yourself inadequately supported (as has\nbeen echoed by the other Officer Trustees). As a result, much of Becky's\nmanifesto points are under the \"work-in-progress\" status and will be the\nfocus of the remainder of her tenure. One major failing on Becky's behalf\nis the engagement of the Liberation & Community Officers. Although\nBecky is well-intentioned in that respect, it has become apparent that the\nwhole structure of the Liberation & Community zones needs widespread\nreform before it can effectively deliver results to the students. Having said\nthat, Becky launched the inaugural Liberation & Community Week and\nhs supported the officers as much as the flawed system has allowed her.\nAreas where Becky has underperformed actually further highlight the lack\nof adequate support provided by the Union - case in point is the petition\nsystem, which still hasn't been implemented because the Systems team is\noverworked and unable to support Becky there.\nFelix: What have you and College delivered?\nBecky: I helped make a disabilities rent subsidy happen so that means that\nanyone with a disability that has had to be in halls in South Kensington gets\naround \u00a3100 subsidy because they can\u2019t live far away. I had input in the new\nmitigating circumstances policy. I got that changed a little bit and they\u2019ve definitely looked more carefully at what they\u2019re doing. The student support strategy\nis happening but it\u2019s incredibly slow.\nManifesto\n\u2022 Establish both academic and extra-curricular provisions to mitigate any\nissues faced due to the growing cohort of students\n\u2022 Maintain and develop the Student Consultation on the Curriculum Review\nto create the best teaching experience for our current and future ICSM\nstudents\n\u2022 Develop our Entertainments and Extra-Curricular activities to be inclusive for all students\n\u2022 Develop our comprehensive Welfare strategy and Wellbeing Representation Network to be accessible to and cater for students of all backgrounds\n\u2022 Promote opportunities for leadership training both to those who are in\ncharge of your time here at ICSM, and to all students to develop their skill\nset for their time at ICSM, and future careers\nfaculties. In addition, the SU is looking to implement a culture shift within\nICSM by increasing its inclusivity and, hence, improving its offering and\nensuring the SU functions to cater to all students. Speaking to Felix, Dan\nsaid: \"Communication has been the biggest, most pressing issue throughout\nthe year. We've realised that there were a lot of key areas that we lacked.\nIt wasn't just general communication but the way we communicate with\ndifferent bodies of the College and ICU and help them understand how we\nfunction, us understanding how they function so we can slot in and work\nbetter\".\nAnother challenge that ICSM has been faced with is the growing cohort of\nstudents. One of the resultant impacts of this is the size of the first year cohort\n\"basically outgrowing the lecture theatres and spaces\". In response, Dan says,\n\"with the new curriculum coming in next year, we're looking at how we can shift\nthe way we're using spaces, shift the class numbers to work round that and that's\nsomething that we've been having constant input on with faculty. Putting out\nconsulatation to students about how they'd like to see space repurposed is a key\npart of that.\nIn response to complaints regarding the 'clubs and socs' room in Reynolds,\nDan explained:\n\"In progress. It's all gone a bit slowly but we had the clubs and socs room itself\nredone and now we're looking at how we use the space in the clubs and socs room\nmore effectively. Unfortunately, in the interim, that's moved into the common\nroom, where the microwave is and we have had that raisedto us very recently.\nIt's something we're going to try and sort out, hopefully making sure the facilities\nlike the microwave are accessible in the next week or two\"\nFelix:Youmentionmaintaininganddevelopingstudentconsultation.\nFirstly, do you think you've don that and how have you done it?\nDan: I have done it, I\u2019m very happy with it. We started off last year, we used\nmainly SU officer-student engagement so we had our welfare officers, our pres-ident, deputy president and our academic officers all-round the table discussing.\nWe tried three main different types of consultation since then. The most effective\none we\u2019ve had so far that hasn\u2019t just involved elected reps has been going out to\nour various hospital sites and doing engagement with the third years out there.\nGetting them together in a room, talking to them about what the curriculum\nreview is, what we\u2019ve got so far and what they\u2019d like to see changed or what\nsupport they\u2019d like from the faculty for them to be able to carry out their roles as\nacademic mentors and supervisors\n\n"

In it, the\nauthor Jon Ronson details his interviews with\nthose who were victims\nof ruthless attacks, perhaps for a bad joke or an\nimmature photo posted\nonline, and sheds light\non the aftermath of those\nshamings, from jobs lost\nto rape threats.\nWe, once the voice-less, are given voices by\nthe internet and social\nmedia, given authority\nto enforce morals as\nwe see fit and given\nroles, such as social\ncontrol police. We stand\nup against injustices,\ncriticise the fraudulent,\nand topple the giants -things we never thought\npossible - all with this\ncombined force. But\nslowly, it has evolved\ninto intensive scrutiny,\nwhere we search for that\none politically incorrect\nstatement and tear its\nowner apart, all in the\npursuit of justice.\nRonson starts off with\nthe example of Jonah\nLehrer, a pop science\nauthor exposed for\nmisquoting Bob Dylan\nand subsequently criticised for his apology\nspeech for which he\nreceived $20,000. He\nwas fired from his job,\nand his 2016 release A\nBook About Love was\nimmediately probed\nfor potential plagiarism and factual errors\nand received largely\nnegative reviews.\nAnother example\nhighlighted in the book\nis when PR executive\nJustine Sacco tweeted,\n\u201cGoing to Africa. Hope\nI don\u2019t get AIDS. Just\nkidding. I\u2019m white!\u201d\nAlthough poorly\nphrased, it was obvious\nthat Sacco intended the\nstatement satirically.\nIn fewer than 140\ncharacters, that tweet\nblew up on the internet\nand flipped Sacco\u2019s\nlife upside down. Criticisms, accusations,\nthreats, personal attacks\nall flocked in as social\nmedia influencers\nrallied their followers\nto do the same. Those\nwho spoke up for her,\npointing out that it\nwas merely terrible\nattempt at humour, were\nimmediately labelled\nracist. Then, Sacco was\nnotified that she had lost\nher job.\nAll of those consequences just because\nof a tweet seems like a\n\u201cJon Ronson\u2019s\nwriting\nreads like a\ndocumentary\nin literary\nform\u201d\nhefty price to pay for\na 140-word mistake.\nThere is no forgiveness\nin this dictionary that is\nthe world of the internet.\nIn real life, if one were\nto make a mistake, it is\nsocial convention that\nwe accept an apology\nand move on. But this is\nnot the case when things\nare taken online, especially when the world\njudges you with the first\nthing that turns up in the\nsearch engine, however\nuntrue that representation may be of you.\nJon Ronson // Flickr\nBOOKS\nJia Qi Tan\nBooks Writer\n\u201cWe are\ndefining the\nboundaries of\nnormality by\ntearing apart\nthe people\noutside of it\u201d\nJon Ronson\u2019s writing\nreads like a documentary in literary form,\ncombining aspects of\njournalism, advocacy,\nand expression of his\npersonal opinions. It is\nexpected that he sets the\ntheme around a central\nidea, with a few main\nbuilding blocks that\nportray different cases\nof online shaming. But\nI find it strange that he\nmentions many tangen-tially related topics with\ninteresting potential\nbut only covers them\nbriefly. For instance, he\nincludes his experience\nin a shame-eradicating\nworkshop and Texas\nJudge Ted Poe\u2019s controversial use of humiliation when issuing\nsentences. One subject\nthat I found particularly\nfascinating and had\nhoped to read more\nabout is how women\nand men are treated\ndifferently as victims of\nshame, with men facing\nmainly the consequence\nof getting fired whilst\nwomen receiving rape\nand death threats. It\nwould have been better\nif Ronson had made\na clear choice, either\nstructuring the book\nin a more streamlined\nmanner or addressing\nthose tangential subjects\nmore thoroughly and\nadding another layer of\ndepth.\nIt is perhaps an intrinsic human flaw that\nhiding behind a blank\navatar brings out the\nworst in us and strips us\nof empathy and respect.\nIt could be that we are\nso eager to elevate ourselves that we resort to\nthe humiliation of others\nto satisfy this need.\nMore often than not, we\nhave confused activism\nwith conformity and\nblatant bullying. It is\ndistressing to see that\nwe can be so sensitive\nabout what is politically\ncorrect that we can treat\nothers so wrongly for\nthat reason. As Ronson\nputs it, \u201cWe are defining\nthe boundaries of normality by tearing apart\nthe people outside of it.\u201d\n\u201cWe, once the\nvoiceless, are\ngiven voices\nby the internet\nand social\nmedia\u201d\nThis book was\nreleased almost four\nyears ago, and many\nthings have changed\nsince then - Justine Sacco\nhas landed a job; the\nusers of Ashley Madison\nwere publicised; doxing\nand cyberstalking have\nbloomed. It is hard to\npredict what trajectory\nwe are moving towards,\nbut one thing is for sure,\nto quote Ronson, \u201cThe\ngreat thing about social\nmedia was how it gave\na voice to voiceless\npeople. Let\u2019s not turn it\ninto a world where the\nsmartest way to survive\nis to go back to being\nvoiceless.\u201d\n\n"

At the end, while the\nmajority of the audience\ndeclared Natarajan to be\nthe winner of the round,\nProject Debater\u2019s performance was praised by\nmany.\nProject Debater made\nits opening argument by\nsupporting the idea of\nsubsidizing pre-schools,\nciting findings on the\npositive effects of subsidization from studies and\nhistorical research. The AI\ngrounded its argument on\nthe idea that subsidization\nshould stem from a moral\nand political obligation\nto the public, citing\nfindings from researches\nthat showed that an early\ninvestment in an individual\u2019s education will lead\nto a more successful life\nin terms of health and\nincome. It also cited how\nthose individuals will be\nless likely to lead a life of\ncrime, which will increase\nthe safety of a neighbour-hood.\nNatarajan made his\nopening argument by\nsiding with the opposi-tion, saying that subsidization doesn\u2019t effectively address issues like\npoverty and crime rates in\na country. He argued that\nit is simply a \u2018politically\nmotivated giveaway to\nthe middle class\u2019, who\nprobably already have\ntheir children enrolled in a\npre-school. He argued that\nother programs would be\nmore effective in tackling\nsuch important issues.\nThroughout the rest\nof the debate, both sides\nprovided interesting and\ninsightful views on the\ntopic, though they varied\nin style and approach.\nProject Debater used data\nto support its arguments,\nwhile Natarajan used his\nexperience and skills to\n\u2018reframe the debate about\nwhere government dollars\ncould be best used to\nensure social equality.\u2019\nThe winner was the\none who was the most\neffective at convincing\nthe audience about the\npersuasiveness of the\narguments put forth and\nwas determined through\na live, online polling.\nBefore the debate, 79%\nof the audience believed\nthat preschools should be\nsubsidized while 13% disagreed and 8% were un-decided. Afterwards, 62%\nagreed that preschools\nshould be subsidized\nwhile 30% disagreed.\nNatarajan won.\nThe thing to note,\nhowever, is not who won\nat the end, but rather the\nfact that both sides only\nhad fifteen minutes to\nprepare for this debate\nand didn\u2019t know of the\ntopic beforehand. This\nmeans that the AI was\nnot only gathering the\nmost relevant information\nneeded to support a side\nand formulating that into\na paragraph, but was\nalso actively listening to\nwhat was being said by\nNatarajan and responded\nto him with its \u201cown,\nunscripted reasoning\u201d to\nconvince the audience\nof its position. This is an\nimportant step forward on\nthe long road to teaching\nan AI to master a human\nlanguage.\nknowledge about the topic\nat hand\u2019, while only 20%\nsaid the same of Natarajan.\nIn a discussion after\nthe debate with four-time\nEmmy award winner John\nDonvan, Natarajan, Dr\nRanit Aharonov and Dr\nNoah Slonim (latter two\nbeing part of the primary\nresearchers behind\nProject Debater), it was\nunanimously agreed that\nit was a historically significant evening. Aharonov\nexplained that Project\nDebater should be seen\nto have huge potential\nin \u2018[understanding] both\nsides of a problem and\npresenting all the pros\nand cons so you have a\nwider view of the topic\nand then can make a better\ndecision\u2019.\nIn other words, the\nprimary researchers\nworking on Project\nDebater aren\u2019t building\nthis AI in order to argue\nbetter than a human,\nwhich many viewers\nwere rightfully concerned\nabout, but rather so that\nit can present sides of an\nargument that a human\nmight not even have\nthought of due to their\nbiases/prejudices. The\ntrue potential of this\nwould be to augment\nhuman decision-making,\nwithout replacing the\nhuman decision maker.\nSlonim added: \u201cUltimately, what we saw was\nthat the interaction of man\nand machine could be\nenriching for both.\u201d\nWhile this is a very\nlong-term goal that can\nonly be achieved once\nthe AI works effective-ly, that evening was a\nhuge step forward in a\nmore short-term one of\n\u2018[mastering] the complex\nand rich world of human\nlanguage.\u2019\nTECH\nKrithika Balaji\nTech Editor\nProject Debater vs Harish Natarajan // cnet\n\u201cBoth sides\nonly had\nfifteen minutes\nto prepare\nfor this\ndebate and\ndidn\u2019t know\nof the topic\nbeforehand\u201d\nSpoiler alert: the AI lost, but not without putting up a good fight.\nAnother interesting\npoint to note is that 58%\nof the audience members\nsaid that Project Debater\n\u2018better enriched their\n\n"
