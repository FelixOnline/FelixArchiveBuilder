    "content": "Dominic Strowbridge tells the story ofthe 1989 London University..\nExpedition to Ecuador\nThere was a complete uproar around the packed\ngalleries, as Ailister, Dominic and Lynn entered the bull\nring and made their way to its centre. The swaying\ncrowd of Indians, dressed in their colourful ponchos,\nwent wild at the prospect of some Gringo blood. The\nother amateur toreadors drew back, leaving the\ntrembling three standing in a triangle, no more than\nten yards apart; the snorting bull at their centre. It was\ngoing to charge at one of them...but which one?\nThis was just one of the interesting situations that\nwe got ourselves into as members of the 1989 London\nUniversity Ecuador Expedition last summer. The team\nof eight undergraduates came from different colleges\nof the University of London. From Imperial were\nexpedition leaders Dominic Strowbridge and Basil\nHeaney; Lynn Hughes, a physicist, and Mark\nPickersgill and Alister Clarke, from Chemical\nEngineering. We were joined by Emma Medcalf and\nJanet Dearden from King's College, and Magnum\nPatrick, from UCL\nWe set the expedition three main aims.\n\u2022 Our primary reason for going was to undertake\na domestic energy survey for the Ecuadorian\ngovernment in a small indian village, high up in the\nmountainous central region.\n\u2022 Closely linked to the energy survey was a project\nto make a film of our experiences for the BBC as an\nentry to the Mick Burke Award. If all goes well, this\nshould be hitting your screens sometime next spring.\n\u2022 And once all the work was over, we set about\nclimbing some of the highest volcanoes in the world.\nWe reached the tops of three, the greatest being\nChimborazo, a6310m giant, whose summit retains\nthe distinction of being the point furthest from the\ncentre of the earth.\nOur journey to South America actually started back\nin November of 1988, when Basil and Dominic put a small ad in FELIX, inviting people to apply for places\non the proposed expedition. Within a few weeks, we\nhad a team of eight, and, together, we set about\ndeveloping our plans, making contact with the\ngovernment and universities of Ecuador, and trying to\nraise the \u00a312,000 necessary to get the project off the\nground.\nWe arrived in Quito, the capital of Ecuador, at the\nbeginning of July. The old colonial city lies at almost\n10,000 feet, surrounded by snow capped volcanoes.\nThe thinner atmosphere at this height left us\nconstantly tired, but this gave us a good excuse to\nacc lim at is e in any one of the many street cafes. We\nwere given a more personal introduction to the city\nby the students of the EPN, the Escuela Politecnica\nNacional, the equivalent of Imperial in Ecuador.\nAfter five days of final preparations with the\nNational Institute of Energy IINEI for whom we were\nworking, we set off for Mercedes Cadena, in the\nprovince of Chimborazo, the village where we were\nto conduct our studies. The village was made up of\nabout 100 families, all of them indigenous indians.\nThey eked out an existence from the dusty fields\nsurrounding the village. Constructed mainly of mud\nand straw their homes were primitive, though most\nwere connected to the electricity supply and had\naccess to a clean water tap.\nPage 10\nOn arrival we were met by the parish priest, Padre\nBalseca, who turned out to be the uncle of our contact\nat INE. This greatly helped our acceptance into the\ncommunity. He showed us our home for the next five\nweeks: the communal hut, a drafty construction,\nwhich we were to share with a prolific family of mice.\nSanitation facilities were basic too. Our only washing\nfacility was a concrete trough standing on the other\nside of the village square. Bathtimes proved to be very\npopular amongst the villagers, attracting quite large\ncrowds. On our first night, the whole village\nassembled, and we had to present ourselves before\na mini-inquisition in the village chapel. Luckily they\naccepted us and gave the go ahead for our work.\nThe Energy Survey\nOur main purpose for staying in Mercedes Cadena was\nto undertake the domestic energy survey. Initially, we\naimed to find out what types, and what qualities, of\nfuels the villagers were currently using for cooking,\nheating and lighting.\nWe began by conducting interviews with five,\ndifferent families, to see if we could improve the\nstructure of the questionnaires that we had designed\nback in England. Once any questions had been\nreworded, we began completing questionnaires in\nearnest, interviewing half the population of the village\nin the five weeks of the study period.\nDespite receiving the go-ahead for the survey work\nat the first night's inquisition in front of the whole\nvillage, individual families were, at times, reluctant to\ncooperate. Rumours had developed, claiming that we\nwere a special team of tax inspectors, brought over\nfrom a foreign country to investigate their affairs.\nThey were especially suspicious of how we insisted\non knowing how many guinea pigs they owned!\nHowever, through our help to the community in other\nways, such as providing free medical clinics, we were\nsoon trusted by the majority of the people and the\nsurvey ran smoothly.\nThe language barrier, perhaps, provided the greatest\nobstacle to our work. Three of the team spoke fluent\n\n"

    "content": "Spanish, which was a great help. Although most of\nthe male members of Mercedes Cadena also spoke\nSpanish, they did so as a second language; their first\nlanguage, and that of the rest of the community, being\nQuechua. We were also restricted in the times when\nwe could conduct the survey. With families leaving\nfor their fields at about 5am, the morning had to be\ndiscounted. They tended to return between four and\nsix o 'clock in the evening. This was when we had to\ncatch them, before darkness descended making a venture around the village too difficult a task.\nAs far as the energy survey went, we found that\nalmost all homes burnt wood, cacti or straw on an\nopen fire for cooking.\nTogether with the students from the EPN, we\nlooked closely for opportunities in which appropriate\ntechnology could benefit the community. We\nidentified two areas: agricultural tools, such as\nthreshing machinery; and developments in the home,\nsuch as more efficient wood burning stoves or simple\nchimneys.\nThe results of our involvement in the medical\naspects of life in Mercedes Cadena uncovered a basic\nlack of knowledge about personal hygiene and health\ncare. We began to address this problem by holding\nmedical clinics and by giving evening classes in\nelementary First Aid. We particularly stressed the\nimportance of preventative medicine. In an effort to\ncontinue this work, we trained two men from the\ncommunity in First Aid. They, along with the students\nfrom the EPN, should now be continuing with the\nmedical clinics that we initiated this summer.\nLastly, on a more personal level, there was Hector,\nthe team's favourite villager and expedition film star.\nHector has been profoundly deaf and dumb since\nbirth. Whilst we were in Ecuador, we took Hector to\na hearing specialist in Quito, an incredible experience\nfor him. The specialist recommended that rather than\nfitting him with a suitable hearing aid, which would\nbe difficult to maintain and might result in cultural\ndifficulties for the six year old boy, he should attend\nBathtime for Alister in the village trough\na special school in Riobamba some fifty miles away.\nAt this school Hector would learn to express himself\nmore clearly and communicate with others using sign\nlanguage. We set up a small fund to provide the\nmoney required for the schooling and travel, and Padre\nBalseca, the parish priest, kindly agreed to manage\nthe programme after we left Ecuador. At the beginning\nof November we heard from Padre Balseca that Hector\nhad started school and was progressing very well.\nIt was during our last weekend in Mercedes Cadena\nthat we came across the bulls. The annual fiesta in\nGuamote coincided with our last weekend in the area,\na justifiable excuse for a special party. The fiesta\nlasted from Friday until Sunday; three days of eating,\ndrinking, music making, dancing and bullfighting. The\nlatter did not take the same form as the well known\nSpanish sport. Rather than the bulls being killed, the\nlocal, amateur toreadors are the ones who often end\nHector has a go at filming\nup being hurt, usually after overindulgence in another\naspect of the fiesta!\nAs the three team members stood trembling in the\ncentre of the ring, the bull made its move. It went for\nLynn, who did the natural thing most amateurs would\ndo in the same situation. He turned to run, but\npromptly fell over. A few adrenal in filled moments\nfollowed as he disappeared in a cloud of dust and\ncharging hooves. The bull then turned and made for\nDominic, whose Iberian bl odd saved him, and the bull\ncharged off to another part of the ring. Lynn was\nthankfully un hrt, though covered in dust. In the eyes\nof the crowd he was the hero of the day.\nThe events of that afternoon convinced even the\nmost sceptical locals that we were really humans, just\nlike them. Three weeks later, as Emma and Dominic\nwere travelling to the mountain refuge on Chimborzo,\nover fifty miles away, their driver turned to them and\nsaid: 'Weren't you the bullfighters at the Guamote\nfestival?'. We had made quite an impression.\nClimbing the volcanos\nOur main climbing objectives were ascents of two of\nthe world's highest volcanoes, Cotopaxi and\nChimborazo. We also climbed a third peak for some\npreliminary training. Before we could begin, though,\nwe said good-bye to two of the team, Janet and Mark,\nwho had to return to England for academic and work\nrelated reasons.\nAfter some initial recon na is ance, we chose\nTungurahua, an active 5016m volcano, as our training\npeak. The first part of our ascent was an arduous trek\nup to 3200m. The trek took us through natural tunnels\nto spectacular views of the jungle thousands of feet\nbelow.\nWe started the final climb at 3am the next morning.\nThe weather was appalling. We were soon the only\nparty climbing that day as the other group, a team of\nGermans, gave up. The six of us carried on as the\nconditions grew worse; freezing rain turning into a blizzard above the snow line. We arrived at the summit\nin near zero visibility and stayed there for only a few\nminutes before making a hasty retreat.\nOur second climb was up Cotopaxi (5850m), the\nhighest active volcano in the world. It's recorded\nactivity dates back to 1534, when the Spanish\nConquistadors ventured into this area. Several\ndestructive and spectacular eruptions occurred; the\nbiggest being in 1877, when rivers of mud from the\neruption reached the Pacific ocean, 250km away.\nWe were joined for this climb by Javier Cabrera, a student from the EPN and one of Ecuador's best\nclimbers. His knowledge of the mountains (he had\nbeen up Cotopaxi more than thirty times) and his\nunflagging enthusiasm kept us going towards the\nContinued overleaf\nPage 11\n\n"

    "content": "The Delator Column\nBy Paul Shanley\nThis week's column is a slight departure from the\nnorm. Instead of opining endlessly on some topic or\nother, I'd like to present an alternative hypothesis to\nwhy natural phenomena occur.\nOne part of the Queen's Speech last week, set a stream of consciousness going. From reading about\nresearch using embryos, I digressed to thinking about\nthe whole concept of nature in general.\nMy original thought concerned recent discoveries\nin the field of medicine. The breakthroughs being\nmade with the onset of new ideas occur because\nmethods are evolving to solve old problems. This year\nsaw our race coming a step closer to fighting cancer.\nIn the future, maybe 20-30 years time, we will be near\nto finding a vaccination against and maybe a cure for\nAIDS. Advances in DNA research may find changes\nbeing made to our genetic make-up to make some\nhandicaps a thing of the past. Spinabifida, Cerebral\nPalsy etc will belong in history books.\nThe question I asked myself is; are these changes\ndesirable?\nFirstly, some history. There exists in geographical\neconomics, a rule called Malthus' Theory. This\nhypothesis, controversial when first introduced in the\n1770s, states that population will increase until there\nis no longer enough food to sustain life. The remedy,\nsays Malthus, is to curb population growth artificially.\nOne theory that springs to mind-and it is probably\nnot unique-is that such curbs already exist in an\nintrinsically occurring form. They emerge as natural\nphenomena such as earthquakes, famine, flood and\nthe like. These tragedies are not freaks or accidents.\nThey appear by design.\nLife is being prolonged in many forms. Heart\ntransplants, new drugs etc. By prolonging human life\nin this way, we are breaking some of the laws of\nnature. This is often illustrated very dramatically in\nbooks or on film by The Great Book. The Great Book\nis a huge tome with details of how long everyone\nshould live for, what the future has in store for them.\nEveryone's destiny is contained within The Great\nBook.\nWell, I wouldn't be quite so dramatic as that.\nAssuming the existence of an 'Encyclopedia of\nMankind' infers a belief in some form of deity. I'm not\nso sure about this. Instead I suggest, that there are\nset laws of nature which could quite easily be\ncommitted to paper. These do not control an\nindividual's destiny, but they do place some form of\nrestriction on a planet's growth-what\nmathematicians would call an upper limit. The basic\nlaw goes something like this:\n\u2022 The total population of a species in any planet is\nbounded by a set figure.\n\u2022 When this figure is approached, measures are taken\nto reduce it. These can be in the form of any type of\nnatural phenom ema. \u2022 These measures may occur in an area distanced\nfrom the vicinity of population build-up.\nThis last condition is important. If there is a population\nexplosion in one area, say China, the law may curb\ngrowth in another area, such as an earthquake in San\nFrancisco.\nLife prolonging schemes violate these laws. There\nare two remedies:\nThe first is to cease any research into medicine that\nextends human life. This is an extremely grey area.\nWhere does one draw the line? Are heart transplants\nto be stopped? Is a block to be put on further research\ninto presently incurable diseases such as cancer or\nAIDS? To take matters to extremes, do we put a stop\non use of donated blood, as this is also an artificial\nway to prolong life? Any blood donors, like myself,\nwould be horrified by the idea. However, the Jehova's Witnesses-one of the more public pressure groups-have been saying this for years.\nNo, the answer is not with the first solution. Any\nmother whose baby daughter needs a life-saving\noperation, anyone who is carrying the HIV virus,\nanyone afflicted with Parkinson's Disease or\nAsbestosis or Herpes would agree.\nThe second solution\u2014the favourable one-is to\naccept the consequences. Life-saving research must\ncontinue but it must do so at a cost of not knowing\nwhat is around the corner. When another Ethiopia or\nSan Francisco occurs, it must be accepted as Mother\nNature's way of tipping the scales back into balance.\nThese ramblings are just another hypothesis. The\nlong-standing religions would argue the case for\nultimate control of our planet and others alike resting\nin the hands of some higher force. Others, the atheists\nof this world, assume that life is made up of what we\nsee and nothing more. My scenario is no less probable\nthan that of the Christian or the Jew or the Muslim.\nThe unanswered question remains-how can we tell\nwhich one of us is right?\nCalling all\nPostgrads\nI am currently researching an article into postgraduate\nlife at Imperial. Recently, I 've spoken to a number of\nPGs who are in some way hacked off with the College.\nThe message, however, appears to be not only what\nthe College can do for them but also ways in which\nthe Union can help. Recent grouses include:\n\u2022 Theft of research work by supervisors who\nsubsequently publish under their own name.\n\u2022 Isolation for new arrivals to college, particularly\nforeign students.\n\u2022 Not enough social events organised for them.\nDespite its very high ratio of PGs, Imperial seems to\nrevolve its leisure pursuits around undergraduates.\n\u2022 Poor academic representation.\nIf any postgraduates have similar complaints or some\nnew ones, please write to me at FELIX. Obviously, all\ncorrespondence is confidential.\n\n"

    "content": "Satanist! Annosis Statistics\nDear Dave,\nMen and women concerned about their personal\nrights should stand up and say NO! to IC Christian\nUnion Committee. Their letter in last week's FELIX\nwas frightening enough to make all moral rights\njunkies piss their pants.\nThey've credited us with the mental age of fifteen\nyear olds who get Jekyll and Hyde symptoms when\nthey see a bit of rump y pump y on the telly.\nThey think they know the difference between sex\nand love, well I think they can't know much about love\nif they want to 'reserve' sex until after marriage, like\na business appointment. And as for marriage being\n'specially stable', I wonder how long your marriage\nis going to last when you realise that your partner\ndoesn't turn you on just as much as you had\nanticipated-don't self-righteously push sex under the\ncarpet or save it like a box of chocolates, it's a very\nimportant and enjoyable part of loving someone. So\nhow dare they tell me that my sexuality is God-given,\nwhat it's for and when to use it.\nIt is frightening that people with blinkered views can\nassume responsibility for the moral standards of\nothers because they think they can do better. A very\nreal example of this is the current tide of re rigi o us fever\nin America bringing about the possibility of abortion\nbeing banned: 'Sixteen years old? Poor? Pregnant?\nWell, UNCLE SAM say you'll have to get married 'cos\nwe ASSUMED you would want a baby and be happy\nall the time, there are no such things as battered\nchildren, murdered wives and barbaric religious laws.'\nDon't you find that scary?\nEven more terrifying is religion itself\u2014a constant\nreminder of the imposed reality in which we exist (like\nTie Rack, McDonalds and battery hens)-and the hold\nit has on people to the extent that you can't reason\nwith them (yes, shock-horror, a direct attack on\nreligion). When will they realise that Jesus probably\ndied for his own sins and I don't even know God so\nhow can he love me? (How do they know anyway??)\nAnd did you see the letter by that yawl ing potato\nchip Richard Marett? He stresses that all pornography\ncomes from Satan, the evil one, God's enemy; he\nALSO reckons that Jesus paid for my sins. Don't worry, Richard, Heaven's just like Disneyland, and as\nlong as you're a good boy, sing loudly in church and\ndon't get laid before you marry, you can have your\nplace there guaranteed (well that's what it's all about\nisn't it??...).\nFancy a dictatorship under Runcietollah? Relax and\nwatch it happen...\nYours sincerely,\nRupert Seldon.\nBantoff\nDear Dave,\nNever one to claim praise where it isn't due (what?),\nI must reluctantly point ot that the mascot ry article\nin last week's issue was not actually my work, but\nthat of Chas Randies (RCSU VP) with Paul Errington\n(RCSU TO). I merely supplied the photos which you\ndidn't use.\nSurely having experienced my literary efforts in old\nBroadsheets, you can't have mistaken this well\nreasoned lament of RSMU for my usual drivel?\nHumbly yours,\nSimon Banton.\nDear Dave,\nThe Tumor of Annosis.\nI do personally believe that (and I am sure anybody\nin his/her right mind will agree with me) the solution\nto the Cyprus problem lies at the delicate hands of the\nsurgeon who is capable of removing completely,\nwithout leaving any trace behind, the tumor of\nAnnosis from the minds of people living on the west\nside of the Aegean Sea. The surgeon is called 'the\nwisdom of seeing the reality'. The rest is nothing more\nthan the buzz of a fly.\nYours Cyprusfully,\nDr Sedat Ozbilen.\nHistory\nDear Dave,\nAfter reading the letters on Cyprus in last week's FELIX we feel that a brief account of the re cnet history\nfo Cyprus is essential, as the so-called friends of\n'Northern Cyprus' have grossly distorted it.\nIn 1960 Cyprus became an independent republic.\nAccording to the constitution the 18% Turkish Cypriot\ncommunity was given cultural and religious\nautonomy, 30% of the posts in the Civil Service, and\n40% in the police. The Turksih Cypriots elected the\nVice President, who could veto any presidential\ndecision and appointed 3 out of 10 ministers. In\nparliament 15 out of the 50 seats were reserved for\nTurkish Cypriots, a separate majority required for a Bill to become law.\nIn 1963 the President of the Republic suggested\namendments to the constitution to the Turkish Cypriot\nleadership. Turkey rejected them on their behalf and\nengineered an inter communal crisis. Turkish Cypriot\nleadership withdrew from 1960 constitution\ninstitutions and set up Turkish military enclaves in\nNicosia leading the Turkish Cypriots into isolation and\npromoting partition. In 1964 Turkish air-foc e bombarded Cyrpus, stirring up inter communal trouble\nthat caused deaths and casualties among both\ncommunities.\nOn 20 July 1974 Turkey invaded Cyprus, in an\no peart ion code named by the Turkish army as 'Attila'\nafter the infamous barbarina, using as a pretext the\ncoup against the Cyprus Government organised by the\nGreek junta. An act in violation of the UN Charter,\ninternational law, and human rights. On 23 July the\nGreek junta fell and on 28 July constitutional order\nwas restored in Cyprus. Turkey nevertheless\ncontinued the aggression and on 14 August mounted\na second attack. As a result 37% of Cyprus is still\noccupied, 40% of the Greek Cypriot population are\nstill refugees, and 1,619 people are sill missing. Today\n65,000 settlers have been transplanted from Turkey\nto the occupied Cyprus, while cultural heritage in the\noccupied areas is systematically destroyed as reported\nby the Council of Europe.\nWhat the Government and people of Cyprus want\nand have proposed, is that the occupation army\nleaves, Cyprus is de militar is ed, and all Cypriots are left\nalone to live peacefully together in a federal Republic.\nUnfortunately at a time that Europe is coming\ntogether, Cyprus is kept divided, by the Turkish army,\nagainst the will of all Cypriots.\nThe Cypriot Society,\n{Friends of the whole of Cyprus!. .\nDear Dave,\nFollowing last week's letters from the so-called\n'Friends of Northern Cyprus' may I note that none of\nthem actually comes from Cyprus since they would\nhave known that:\na) The only official census of 1960 showed that the\nthen population of Cyprus was approximately\n660,000 of which 82% were Greek Cypriots and\n18% were Turkish Cypriots.\nb) Turkey invaded Cyprus in 1974 with the pretext\nof restoring constitutional order in Cyprus after a coup\nd 'etat staged by the then Greek Military Junta. Instead\nthey occupied 37% of the northern part of the island,\nwhich ironically had a less percentage of Turkish\nCypriots than the South, purely for strategic reasons,\nand forced 200,000 Greek Cypriots out of their\nhomeland (equivalent to the UK is about 20 million).\nc) In order to change the demography of Cyprus to\nwhat the 'Friends of Northern Cyprus' make now\n30%, Turkey transplanted 65,000 Turkish Anatolian\nsettlers to the occupied area. The settlers together\nwith the occupation troops (35,000) will soon\noutnumber the indigenous Turkish Cypriot population,\nand they certainly impose their political view to the\nCypriots want the unification of the island.\nd) The position of the democratically elected Cypriot\nGovernment ever since independence, was never that\nof 'Enosis' (Unification with Greece). 'Enosis' is just\nthe vision of Turkish expansion is m who would like to\nincorporate Northern Cyprus to Turkey.\nFinally a plea to the prospective holiday maker. The\nmajority of the land, homes and hotels in Northern\nCyprus belong to people who are not allowed to visit\nthem and are forcefully and illegally (by international\nlaw) deprived of.\nBy visiting Northern Cyprus you are granting\napproval to an unjust situation, and you are making\nour struggle for a united, just and free Cyprus that\nmore difficult.\nKypros Pilakoutas,\nIRefugee from Northern Cyprus)\nEarthquake Engineering, Civ Eng Dept.\nPersonal\nDear Dave,\nIn response to Mark Page's letter in the last issue\nof FELIX there are some issues I would like to put\nstraight on the matter of Nicky Fox's resignation as\nConservative Society Chairman and what she\ndid/didn't tell FELIX. I was the person who interviewed\nNicky for the article printed 3/11/89 during which she\nmentioned the personal and political reasons why she\nhad stepped down. The article was submitted and, as\nwith most news items, was edited down to the space\nallowed. In a letter 17/11/89 Nicky mentioned that\nshe had told of her personal reasons. I would like to\nask what more Mr Page requests; that Nicky reveal\nin detail what her personal reasons were?\nAs someone who is most definitely outside of\nConSoc I would find the volley of retaliating letters\namusing if it were not for the underlying facts that\nNicky didn't resign purely on political grounds and that\nshe has a right to privacy on personal matters.\nI hope that this has gone some way to clarifying the\nmatter.\nYours sincerely,\nAndrew Waller.\nPage 15\n\n"

The survey will take two formats:\none to cover halls of residence, the other to cover\nstudents in the private rented sector. The surveys will\nserve two purposes: firstly the survey on halls of\nresidences will settle exactly how the students feel\nabout their halls; eg price, comfort, facilities,\nadministration. Secondly, the information gathered\nfrom students in the private rented sector will provide\nthe basis for starting up a letting agency so that\nstudents find it easier, quicker and cheaper to find\naccommodation.

In order to confirm or deny these\nfeelings, I need some kind of feedback from you, the\nstudents. The perfect forum for this is a Union General\nMeeting. Next Thursday at 6pm in the JCR discussion\nwill take place on this subject, if you have any feelings\nat all on this subject turn up and say so.

Umpire, Sydney HarbourBridge coped well with the complaints from the Barts\ncaptain, who kept insisting that we delay the start\nuntil her team arrived!! How unreasonable can you\nget!! Fortunately, with the astro only booked until 3pm we had to start without them. With the return of\nJackie Wilderhaber to goal, the captain was forced out\nof her usual position, onto the pitch. Despite the break\nof three weeks she bulldozed through the Barts\ndefence on three separate occasions, to claim her first\nhat-trick for IC and her first goals of the season.\nForward Wendy Kite and demon hitter Lisa Kiwi got\nsome serious hockey together with Lisa powering the\nball through the whole of the Bart's defence to\nWendy, leaving her 30 yards head start and two\npeople between her and the goal. Although failing to\nscore on this occasion she did manage to put two\nother goals in the back of the net, one played brilliantly\noff the back line by right wing Laura Betteridge. The\nfinal goal was scored by Centre forward Jackie Scott,\nwho smashed it through the defence from the back\nof the circle, just as the defence thou v,,,i they had it\ncleared. With some brilliant play from the IC defence,\nstopping everything Barts attempted to get through\nthem, the future is certainly looking good for the\nseconds, and promotion is in sight already!!\nIC Ladies 11-1 Sussex Ladies II\u20140\nOn Wednesday IC ladies seconds secured themselves\na place in the next round of the UAU competition. A brilliantly taken free hit by centre half Jane Bunch left\nJackie Scott clear to slip the ball in under the\ngoalkeeper in the opening minutes. Unfortunately,\ndespite IC having the ball for nearly the rest of the\ngame, the forwards failed to produce anything\ninspirational. Halfbacks Jane, Diana Hill and Anna\nGray played brilliantly, stopping Sussex every time our\nForwards gave them the ball, and returning it up the\npitch for us to try again!! Oona and Hazel saw very\nlittle of the ball, but tackled well when called upon.\nStar of the match, in her return to goal, was captain\nAlison Franklin, who didn't touch the ball once!\n(Thanks to the IC defence) With three wins, one draw\nand one loss we now expect a day trip to Bristol or\nBath to further our UAU careers!!\nFootball\nIC 11-2(0) QMC 11-1(0)\nHa! 'It only takes a second to score a goal' and 'the\ngame isn't over until the final whistle' were well used\nclich es by the time IC got to the bar. Trailing to an\nundeserved QMC goal shortly after half time, IC left\nit late to stamp their complete dominance on the game\nand steal the point. There should have been at least\nseven goals produced by an IC onslaught in the\nsecond half, but chance after chance was wasted.\nGoals by R Martinez and J Fordham in the 88th and\n89th minutes were enough to win the game and\nrelieve the team's frustration.\nIC 11-1(1) Sussex-3(0)\nThe IC II band wag gon broke its rear axle in this one.\nForm book predictions were for an impressive victory\nand triumphant march into the next round. History\nsucks! A penalty miss in the first minutes of the game\nby E Coates, the IC captain, didn't help the team's confidence. This was temporarily restored by a well\ntaken goal from A Jalan. However, the appalling\nreferee kept stopping the game and IC never found\ntheir rhythm. Sussex were much better at playing\nbadly than IC and stole their goals in the second half.\nIC sought sol lace in the Hammersmith pub crawl after\nthe match, with Pip Peel being the winner.\nPage 6\nKings College-2 IC 1sts1 The referee set himself up as the Robin Hood of\nfootball, stealing the game from richly talented IC and\nhanding it to our rivals Kings. Two goals in the first\nten minutes of the second half, the first from a dubious penalty that Kings didn't even appeaL for, and\nthe second from a through-ball which found three\nKings players offside. To his credit, the referee gave\nIC an equally dod gy penalty later on but Pat Fancock\nlent back too far and sent the ball soaring over the bar.\nIC had the better of the first half, Tone de Lyon\nhitting the underside of the bar with a swerving free\nkick, and several efforts were only just scrambled\naway. Kings looked menacing from a series of corners,\nwith Pip Peel, playing an unaccustomed defensive\nrole, hooking a dangerous ball away and Si Holden\nperforming an acrobatic reverse dunk over the bar to\navoid ert ding up in the net with the ball. Mike Patton's persistent hustling finally brought IC a goal just before\nhalf-time, forcing an own goal out of their defence.\nIC return to Berrylands in the quarter finals of the\nCup in ten days time and Kings should expect to get\ntheir arse s kicked then.\nIC VI-2 LSE IV-3\nIC battled hard against an onslaught of opposition\nwinging and mad, head-butting pitch invaders in this\nexciting two-sided match.\nIn the first half Jem Ellis superbly equalise d after\nDamon Thomas had managed to head Mike Potter's leg (instead of the balls), to let in their striker.\nThe second half submitted to some of IC's finest\nfootball, but LSE still managed to befuddle the Pinky\nand Rupert defence combination, to knock in two half\nchances, leaving only ten lonely minutes left.\nBut did the team surrender? Nay, I hear you moan,\nas some good work from our new striker and other\nonlookers let Jem in to slip in his second, suggesting\nan exciting finish.\nAnd what a finish it was! A lanky loony decided to\nhead-butt our goalie to steal the match ball thirty\nseconds before we could score two goals, to steal\nvictory.\nAll round shocked looks ensued, before the happy-go-lucky referee decided to prematurely ejaculate the\nplayers from the field. And what a loss it was!\n\n"

    "content": "Michael Carlile investigates the link between the early years of\nbiochemistry, horse chestnuts and the first president of the Jewish State.\nConkers, Cordite and\nThe State of Israel\nPrime Minister: 'Dr Weizmann, you have saved your\ncountry! Name your reward! A knighthood perhaps?'\nDr Chaim Weizmann: 'A national Home in Palestine\nfor the Jewish People'\nThat is one version of the story, resembling that\nsubsequently told by Lloyd George, the Prime Minister\nin question. That version is surely a myth: top people,\nespecially experienced politicians, do not behave that\nway. But the myth, like many myths, is based on\ntruth. What did happen? The participants all told\nslightly different tales but the broad outline of the\nstory is clear.\nSome time between 1906 and 1913, Chaim\nWeizmann, working at the University of Manchester,\ndiscovered the acetone-but an ol fermentation. This is\na process in which a bacterium, now known as\nClostridium Acetobutylicum, converts starch or sugar\nto acetone and but an ol. Weizmann, as well as being\na gifted chemist, biochemist and microbiologist, was\na leading figure in Zionist politics, encouraging the\nemigration of Jews to Palestine with the ultimate aim\nof establishing a Jewish State.\n1914 saw the outbreak of The First World War.\nSoon Britain was faced with a desperate shortage of\nacetone, needed as the solvent for making cordite, the\nexplosive used for firing shells from naval guns and\nheavy artillery. Acetone was then made by the\n. pyrolysis of wood, dry distillation of wood in the\nabsence of air, with 100 tons of wood giving one ton\nof acetone. The main producer was Germany, and\neven if plants had been built in Britain, enormous\namounts of timber would have had to be imported.\nWith shipping shortages and the blockade, this would\nnot have been feasible.\nIn 1915, Weizmann was asked by Winston\nChurchill, First Lord of the Admiralty, if he could make\n30,000 tons of acetone. Weizmann, who had\npreviously made a few hundred grams in the\nlaboratory, undertook the million-fold scale-up that\nwas needed. Biotechnology was born. The first pilot\nplant was set up at Nicholson's gin factory at Bromleyby-Bow, which had both fermentation and distillation\nfacilities.\nThe project worked, but it soon became clear that\nthe necessary raw material, half-a million tons of\nmaize, was not to be had in war-time Britain, nor was\nthere a surplus of any other grain or of sugar. Boy\nscouts collected horse-chestnuts, rich in starch, but\nwars are not won with conker s. Eventually, as\nhappened with penicillin 25 years later, large scale\nproduction was transferred to the USA. Meanwhile,\nBalfour had succeeded Churchill at the Admiralty, and\nLloyd George had become Minister of Munitions.\nBy 1917, Balfour had become Foreign Minister and\nLloyd George, Prime Minister. In November, the\ndocument that became known as the Balfour\nDeclaration was issued. It stated that the British\nGovernment would use their best endeavours to\nfacilitate the establishment in Palestine of a National\nHome for Jewish People. The Declaration is regarded\nby historians as a crucial step towards the\nestablishment of the State of Israel, as it permitted\nJewish emigration to Palestine on a much larger scale.\nThe conversion of acetone-but an ol fermentation\nfrom a laboratory experiment to an industrial process\nin about a year was a remarkable achievement. It was\nthe first time that sterile culture had been practised\non an industrial scale and, in this respect, the process\nwas the precursor of the industrial fermentation s that\nnow yield antibiotics, enzymes and an increasing\nrange of other products.\nIt is unlikely that the Balfour declaration was a direct\nreward for Weizmann's services to Britain. His\nachievements must, however, have convinced Balfour\nand Lloyd George that they were dealing with a practical man of the very highest ability, and that the\nideas of Zionism were not merely the fantasies of\neccentric visionaries.\nWeizmann received no civil honour from the British\nGovernment. He did, however, receive ten shillings\n(50p) for every ton of acetone made by his process\nduring the war. The resulting \u00a310,000, perhaps\nequivalent to half a million pounds of today's money,\nenabled him to devote himself full-time to Zionist\nactivities.\nWeizmann's acetone-but an ol fermentation process\nwas much more efficient than its predecessors,\nyielding about 10 tons of acetone and a similar\namount of but an ol from 100 tons of raw material. It\nwas, however, soon superceded. From 1920 to 1960\nit was gradually replaced by catalytic processes using\npetrochemical feedstocks. It still survives, for\nstrategic reasons, in South Africa, which does not\nwish to be dependent on imported petrochemicals, the\nsupply of which is'vulnerable to sanctions.\nWhat became of the human participants in the\nstory? Balfour, who was getting old, retired from\npolitics. Lloyd George's political fortunes declined\nwith those er f the Liberal Party, and in his old age he\nwrote his unreliable memoirs. Churchill continued his\nturbulent career, which culminated in his role as\nBritain's leader in the Second World War. In 1948,\nWeizmann became the first president of Israel.\nResearch using human embryos is, by its very nature,\nan emotive subject. Few people would disagree that\nthis research needs regulating and, after years of\ncarefully avoiding the issue, the Government has\ndecided to act. The embryo-research bill, shortly to\nbe put before Parliament, will come in two versions,\none including clauses limiting experiments to fourteen\ndays after fertilisation, the other banning such\nexperiments altogether. MPs will be given a free vote,\nindependant of party political pressures, on which\nversion of the bill to accept. It is, after all, a matter\nof principle.\nThis is where the problem lies. Politicians and their\nilk like principles. On a matter of principle, something\ncan be either right or wrong, good or evil, black or\nwhite-there are no shades of grey. Whether or not\nembryo research should be allowed becomes a simple\nmatter of belief, so obvious that it does not even need\nthinking about.\nThe issue has already become entangled with other\nmatters of principle. The anti-abortion lobby is already\nout in force. Womens' groups are complaining that the\nbill ignores the rights of the mother. These groups and\nothers, equally convinced of the rightness of their\ncauses, see the bill as nothing more than a convenient\nweapon.\nAmid all this din, the true purpose of the bill could\neasily be forgotten. The important issues of medical\nethics and the guidelines contained within it will not\nbe discussed. They will become irritating 'problems'\nassociated with allowing research to continue. The\npoliticians will be faced with a choice, either to make\none 'simple' decision and ban research entirely or to\nface a plethora of complicated technical problems.\nThe vote-hungry always take the easy way out.\nThis has already happened in Germany where\nembryo research is now illegal. Similarly, the American\nGovernment has refused to fund such research for the\npast year and has recently confirmed that this ban will\ncontinue indef in in it ely. On the other hand, countries\nsuch as Japan are supporting and even encouraging\nembryo experimentation, albeit within tight ethical-guidelines.\nIt could be said that embryo research will continue\nwhether Britain bans it or not: German biotechnology \u2022\ncompanies have not stopped their work but merely\nmoved it to French laboratories.\nOur Parliament will spend the next few weeks\narguing over an issue with no answer. In this tele visual age we will even be able to see them doing so and\nthe honourable members will no doubt get especially\nirate for the cameras. But what will they have\nache i ved at the end? Embryo research will not stop.\nIt may continue here, it will definitely continue\nelsewhere.\nI hope that Britain continues in the field. Nobody can\ntell what any research may bring and embryo research\nhas already given infertile couples the chance to have\nchildren. It may help cure the victims of Parkinson's disease. There are even researchers who believe that\nit could help control AIDS. What is not in doubt is that\nif the anti-research lobby have their way, we will have\nache i veda grand total of sod all.\nJason Lander\nPage 5\n\n"

The\nslopes were steep, but the snow conditions were\nexcellent at this time.\nDawn was an incredible sight, the huge shadow of\nCotopaxi sketched out over a billowing carpet of cloud\nbelow us. Soon the wind picked up, causing a big drop\nin temperature and lifting up this carpet to envelope\nus. We arrived at the top in zero-visibility, but the\nfeeling of elation at reaching the summit of such a high\npeak made up for the lack of view. This feeling turned\nto awe after ten minutes when the cloud suddenly\ncleared and revealed a most spectacular scene. The\ndark, active crater of Cotopaxi became visible below\nus, as did the many peaks on the horizon. We could\nclearly see Chimborazo over one hundred miles away.\nIt looked formidable.\nChimborazo was our ultimate goal. It's summit has\nthe distinction of being the furthest point on the globe\naway from its centre, due to the earth's asymmetry.\nWe spent three days in the refuge on Chimborazo at\n5000mac cli mati sing, relaxing and practicing ice\nclimbing techniques. Javier had kindly agreed to\naccompany us up this peak as well. On the fourth day\nwe began to climb at 1am to make the most of the\ngood snow conditions. The reality of our awesome\nobjective was made clear to us as a nearby avalanche\nthrew up a chilling cloud of snow around us. At the\nfoot of the massive sera c cliff, which guards the last\n500m to the summit, the team split into two groups.\nDominic, Alister and Magnum made the more usual\ntraverse under the sera cs to reach the summit around\nthe north side of the mountain; while Lynn and Basil\ntook an unconventional direct route. Both groups\nmade it to the summit. Javier and Emma made their\nown attempt the next day, reaching the summit and\ndescending in a grueling twelve hour marathon. For\nall six of the remaining team to successfully reach the\nsummit of this daunting mountain at their first attempt\nwas an incredible achievement. It had defeated many\nbetter but, perhaps less enthusiastic, climbers before.\nWe felt good!\nFollowing the end of the mountaineering, the\nexpedition's field activities grew to a close. The\nremaining team divided into two groups for the return\nto England: Alister, Emma, Lynn and Magnum spent\na couple more weeks in Ecuador, exploring the jungle,\nswinging on liana vines and catching piran a fish, and\nalso finding time to relax on the Pacific coast; Dominic\nand Basil went off in s each of more South American\nadventures, making their way back to Old Blighty via\nColombia, Venezuela and a rather hurricane damaged\nCaribbean.

    "content": "More Cyprus Mary's reply Horrific\nDear Dave,\nWe were moved by the vigour of the letters in the\nprevious issue of FELIX about Northern Cyprus.\nHowever, the anonymous authors, unfortunately\nappear to be the victims of the thriving Turkish\npropaganda. To restore the truth, we want to clarify\nthe following points:\nEver since the Declaration of Independence of\nCyprus in 1960, Greece, Turkey and Britain have\nmaintained their forces in Cyprus as guarantors. Greek\narmed forces have to be present on the island to\nensure that the agreement is honoured, at least in the\npart that remains independent, and to protect the\npopulation against another incident. To say that these\nforces are occupying Cyprus, implies that British\nforces are occupying Cyprus too, which, of course,\nis not true.\nThe claim that the Turkish-Cypriots have now finally\nfound peace in N. Cyprus away from the 'Greek\ntyranny' does not really explain why many Turkish\nCypriots have stayed in S. Cyprus, while many others\nflee there to find the so-called 'oppression and\nsuffering'. It is also worth noting that Ozgier Ozgour,\nthe leader of a Turkish-Cypriot party recently asked\nthe Turkish Government in Ankara to withdraw all\nTurkish troops from N. Cyprus for peace to be finally\nrestored among the Cypriots. This statement was\nquickly covered by the Turkish government.\nEvery informed person knows which country is\nruled by a military regime under which human rights\nare despised, as is repeatedly pointed out by Amnesty\nInternational.\nAs for the 'breathtaking historical monuments' that\nwere advertised in these letters, it is needless to say\nwhich of the two civilisations created them.\nThe United Nations consider Cyprus as a country\nunder invasion and partial occupation; their decision\nis that Cyprus is a self-determined country. It is\ndistressing that the Turkish government with its\nUnilateral Declaration of Independence of N. Cyprus\nis clearly attempting to perpetuate the division of\nCyprus and its people at a time when in Europe walls\nare being torn down.\nWe wish to invite the authors of the letters in the\nprevious issue to meet us to debate on this subject.\nWe believe that open-minded people, as students are,\nwill soon arrive to a conclusion which is acceptable\nfor both sides and not tarnished by prejudice.\nYours sincerely,\nThe Committee of the Hellenic Society of Imperial\nCollege.\nTurd in pool\nDear FELIX,\nJust when you thought it was safe to go into the\nwater...\nAs a regular visitor to the IC Sports Centre, I wish\nto complain about the state of the pool.\nMost people swim on the surface and they are\nspared the horrors of the deep end. The amount of\nhair, hair bands and earrings is appalling but I suppose\nnot surprising. Even marbles and golf balls can be seen\nby anyone diving down to the deep end, but coming\nface to face with a killer turd? I dread to think how\nthis revolting object came to be on the bottom of the\npool but all you swimming without goggles, beware\nstay off the bottom or you might come in contact with\nthe objects of the deep.\nName withheld by request.\nPage 14\nDear Editor,\nI felt that it was necessary to comment on the\ncontroversy surrounding the Dean of St Mary's binning of FELIX, Issue 850, November 17, 1989.\nThe pictures accompanying the article were\ndegrading and irrelevant to the somewhat 'scanty'\ncontent of the article. You obviously misunderstood\nthe reasons behind the Dean's actions. I am confident\nthat his reasons were sound and now firmly believe\nthat FELIX are inexperienced in approaching a controversial subject such as pornography in a professional manner. Spending some time with\npatients in sexually transmitted disease clinics would\nalter your viewpoints. You should also consider the\nwhole of the Dean's memorandum.\nSecondly, in reply to the letter headed 'Mary's Whitehouse', this further underlines the ignorance of\nImperial College students regarding the way St Mary's works and the position of the 'students' already in a semi-professional role. The Students' Union is an\nintegral part of our Medical School but maintains its\nown principles and ideas. I feel the arrogant\nassumption that decisions are made for us is\nunjustified and misinformed.\nFinally, I note the anonymity of the letter. This is\nhypocritical, as a student should 'feel free to say and\nprint their opinions of him and his actions' without the\nfear of getting bad references from the college.\nYours sincerely,\nAndrew Klava,\nVice President, SMH Students' Union.\nKurds & why\nDear Dave,\nIt is encouraging to see the friends of Northern\nCyprus condemn human rights violations, but their\nconcern and cries of outrage seem to diminish\nwhenever the subject changes to Turkey's oppression\nof its Kurdish minority, which incidentally numbers\nwell over 12 million. To say the least, the Kurdish\nlanguage, folklore or any sympathies are still forbidden\nand are punishable offences in a country which seeks\nmembership to the EC and which to this day does not\nofficially recognise its Kurds as a minority group. No\nwonder they would rather burn alive than return there.\nEvidence on this matter and plenty of it is available\nfrom Amnesty, an organisation whose reputation only\nan ignorant bigot would challenge.\nAs for the 'disreputable record', the authors might\nhave been wiser to leave this phrase out, as it only\nserves to disrepute the Turks or at least their\ngovernments. History speaks for itself, so clearly there\nis no need to remind our dear friends of certain sad\nand terrible events earlier in this century, as it will not\nhelp in any way to solve current problems.\nSurely the friends of Northern Cyprus would\ncondemn all violations of human rights anywhere in\nthe world including Turkey's, if they were sincere.\nAnd it would be shocking to hear any excuses\nexplaining these injustices or brushing them aside.\nInstead they should sit with their fellow Greek Cypriot\nstudents and work towards peace and a solution to\ntheir problems, (and the Kurdish problem with the\nKurds) instead of haggling about who started it.\nAfter all, we have the key to the future.\nYours sincerely,\nDAH Sherif.\nDear Dave,\n'My cell mate was taken to the courtyard. They\nstripped his chest bare, forced him to lie, his back on\nthe ground, and placed a heavy stone on to his chest.\nThe heat was almost unbearable. He died after a few\nhours, probably after repeated heart attacks, which\nwas the official cause of death.'\nThis is an account of what happened to a Prisoner\nof War in Turkey, a couple of years ago. About 1,700\nGreek (including many Greek Cypriot) POW's went\nmissing after the invasion of Cyprus in 1974. Very\nfew of them have been seen again. This is an answer\nto allegations, in last week's FELIX, that the Turkish\nArmy invaded Cyprus to 'protect human rights'.\nThe Turkish dictatorships have, in this respect,\nundergone some progress: in the 1920s, Suyma's( TS?) Greek area was burned together with its\ninhabitants. Some had the time to throw themselves\ninto the sea. Most had their arms chopped off as they\ntried to climb onto ships. The grandchildren of some\nof the others are amongst us.\nAlthough the Turkish Army certainly doesn't nail\npeople to trees, through their stomachs, or induce\nthem with honey to be eaten by insects anymore,\ntorture described in the beginning of the letter is bad\nenough.\nThousands of Cypriots found one day that they\nwould never go back to their houses. Some of them\nare members of ICU and they can't sunbathe on their-'unspoiled beaches with crystal clear seas'. They\nwould just pray to be admitted in their hometown and\nvillages for a couple of hours, to fill a jar with earth\nfrom the fatherland, to have something to soak up\ntheir tears.\nEnosis-Union with the Hellenic Motherland-now\nand forever, is for Cyprus the only guarantee of Peace,\nwhich we all ardently desire. This letter is not a provocation, I don't want to have an argument with\nanyone, nor is it a product of hatred which I do not\nhave for anyone. Just bitterness, that sorrow of so\nmany humans is drowned by the 'crystal clear seas'\nand the 'Turkish delights' that the anonymous authors\nof last week's FELIX advertised.\nEmmanuel Saradakis, Physics 2.\nDean support\nDear Mr Smedley,\nI am a medical student at St Mary's Hospital\nMedical School and am writing to you to express my\nwhole hearted support for our Dean, Professor\nRichards. My experience of reading FELIX in the past\nis that it is not part ul a rly stimulating, informative or\nserious in its nature. Indeed the attitude of the Editor\nand some of the correspondents in this issue is\nincredibly childish, short-sighted and irresponsible, as\nwas the publication of explicit, pornographic material.\nApart form the possible exposure to patients to that\nmaterial and the damage to their sensibilities, in\nPaddington we are exposed to the sex industry day\nin and day out we do not need it plastered over a student magazine as well. I would like to end with an\nappeal to the Editor of FELIX to realise that some of\nus live in a harsh and very real world of human\nsuffering and that it is irresponsible for students to\nincrease that suffering by gratuitous and mindless\nactions. Next time THINK about the consequences of\nyour actions.\nYours sincerely,\nSarah Dunkley.\n\n"

Not only have I and\nsome of the staff come down with the flu bug, some\ntwit managed to cut through a66,000 volt cable\nyesterday afternoon, removing our power for an hour\nor so. Such is life I guess.\nLoans\nThe bug I have picked up has caused some extremely\nodd and feverish dreams. At the beginning of the\nweek, everything began to take on a strange tinge of\nblue. I slowly started to realise how foolish I had been\nto complain about loans. After all, I won't have to take\none out and I always received an income from my\nparents when I was here. Why should I care, I thought?\nThat was when I realised that everybody else was\nwearing the same blue tinted glasses. Why should I be bothered for the students at IC when all that they\nwere concerned for was themselves? That is why I am supporting Neil McCluskey in the UGM motion in\nfavour of loans.\nOf course, you could always prove us wrong.\nRents\nRents have inevitably risen again this year. As\nProfessor Ash has said, this was unavoidable. At least\nthe increases are less than inflation. Although Neil\nmust be feeling pretty sore, since he promised to hold\nrents static, he must be more worried by the ulterior\nissues at stake. Their is clearly a strong move towards\nremoving the rent advisory side of Student Residences\nCommittee. This is the only point at which students\nare represented by the Union President on the\nquestion of rents. If SRC becomes a body which just\nadvises the Rector on the ratio of men to women in\nhalls and what colour we should paint the window\nsills, then it will be pointless.\nI hope that the College does not decide to follow\nthis route.

    "content": "South Korea comes to IC\nThe President of South Korea, Mr Roh Tae Woo, visited Imperial College on Thursday. The visit was instigated by GECMarconi, who collaborate with IC on a number of projects, including robotics.\nDuring the visit he met the Rector, Professor Eric Ash, who later told Felix that Imperial College's connections with\nSouth Korea had proved extremely fruitful.\nHall rents go up again\nThe proposed rents for college student\nhalls next year have been released. They\ninclude a rise of 4.5% to \u00a346 per week\n(excluding food) for Linstead, Southside,\nWeeks and Fisher halls single rooms, and\nno change for double and triple rooms\n(details in the Union page).\nBoth the Student Residence Committee\n(SRC) and Imperial College Student Union\nhave recommended that the rents should\nnot be increased any further as the limit\nstudents can afford has been reached. Mr\nJohn Smith, who was the College\nSecretary last year, put forward these\nproposals despite the SRC\nrecommendation. He told Felix that the\n'SRC was, as is often the case, unable to\nreach a unanimous decision' and that he\nhad 'orders to reduce the college deficit'.\nHe recognised that high rents were\ndetrimental to recruitment, and for that\nreason had decided on a compromise. He\nadded that the rents would not be finally\ndecided until the value of the student grant\nfor next year had been published, which\nwould probably be in February or March.\nProfessor Ash said he was 'happy to\nagree with this recommendation'. He told\nFelix that according to the law of this\ncountry, public funds could not be used\nto sub sid is e rents. 'It's not as if we can\ndecide rent in an arbitrary way' he added.\nMr Smith's decision to set rents after\na divided meeting of SRC could mean the\nend of the Committee's advisory powers\non rents. Mr Smith has advised the Rector\nthat the College's new business manager\nmay 'have views about the committee\nstructure and the need for managers to\nmanage.'\nNUS loans march success\nStudents f om all over the United Kingdom\nmarched through central Glasgow last\nTuesday. The action was the latest attempt\nby the National Union of Students (NUS)\nto gain public support against the\nGovernment's Student Loans Bill. Twenty\nthousand students were estimated to have\nbeen addressed by Members of Parliament\nand Education Union leaders. The venue,\nGlasgow, was decided because the central\nadministration of the Student Loan\nCompany is to be based there.\nRepresentatives of most of the\nopposition parties spoke at the rally,\nincluding Ms Diana Warwick, leader of\nthe Association of University Teachers\n(AUT), Mr. Tony Worthington MP, the\nshadow spokesperson on education and\nMr. Archie Kirkwood MP, of the\nDemocrats.\nAn NUS spokesperson told Felix that\nthe march was 'without doubt very\nsuccessful' and that there was a 'mood of\ndetermination, although it was good\nhumour ed'. There was one arrest during\nthe march and the spokesperson added that\nthe media coverage had been poor\nthroughout the country except Scotland.\nThe NUS are still deciding their next\nstep against student loans, though they say\nthey are optimistic about their chances of\nsuccess if students and student unions are\nenergetic in their opposition. According\nto a recent NUS opinion poll sixty percent\nof the population of the United Kingdom\ndoes not support the student loans\nproposals.\nIssue 852\nFriday 1st December\n\n"

    "content": "Alcohol awareness week\nIntroduction\nAlcohol awareness is the theme of the second welfare\ncampaign of this year taking place on Thursday and\nFriday (7th and 8th December).\nThe whole aim of the campaign is not to force you\nto stop drinking alcohol but to promote an awareness\nof how much you are drinking and what effect that\ndrinking has upon you. Over the two days Riverside\nHealth Authority will have a display in the JCR which\nwill have information leaflets available and friendly\npersonnel to offer advice. On the Thursday evening\nthere will be a bar quiz held in the Union Snack Bar\nwith special promotions on selected low alcohol drinks\nand free samples of others.\nWhy do we drink?\nHave you ever stopped to ask yourself why you drink\nalcohol? You may come up with the answers; to relax,\nto feel happy, to forget or to social is e( some of you\nwould even say simply to get pissed). All of the above\nare applicable but cast your minds back to your first\ndays as a Fresher, did you feel an overwhelming social\npressure to drink? Most people certainly would say\nyes. Especially in institutions such as Imperial the\nchoice of whether to drink or not seems to have\ndisappeared. But you do have a choice.\nOnce you've freed yourself from the social\npressures to drink you can then make a choice of\nwhether to drink or indeed how much to drink. To help\nyou in y or choice you should consider the following.\nHow much do we drink?\nAwareness of the health hazards of drinking to excess\nis quite high (liver disease, heart disease, brain\ndamage, overweight, etc).\nAwareness of the recommended limits is relatively\nlow (14 units for women 21 units form men per\nweek).\nAwareness of how much we actually -drink is\npractically zero.\nTo help you to help yourself a drink diary has been\nproduced so that you can easily keep a tab on what\nyou've been drinking.

    "content": "What a load of shish Edited\nDear Dave,\nReferring back to the letters published in the last\nthree issues of FELIX, on the subject of Cyprus, the\nunfair pressure put on STA not to advertise holidays\nto Northern Cyprus by a few Greeks, but ill-informing\nthem, is totally unjustified.\nIt is unfortunate that there are hardly any Turkish\nCypriots from the Republic of Northern Cyprus in\nImperial College who can make their voices heard. The\nGreek Cypriots repudiated the 1960 agreements,\nwhich formed the legal basis of the Republic of\nCyprus, by their conduct from 1963 to 1974. They\ncannot possibly be regarded today as the lawful\ngovernment of the Republic, which was by its very\nCome on\nDear Dave,\nI would like to respond to a couple of points raised\nlast week concerning the quality of FELIX.\nLast year FELIX was an excellent newspaper. It was\ninter sting, informative and often amusing. It was a delight to read, and was extremely popular.\nThis year I have been extremely disappointed with\nFELIX. Issue 851 was the first I actually enjoyed,\nthough this was more due to the readers' letters than\nany particular effort on your behalf. FELIX is padded\nout with monotonous ball-by-baH football\ncommentaries, uninformative record and concert\nreviews, recycled 'Film '89' film reviews and boring\nnature a bi-communal state. The Turkish Cypriots had\nno choice but to establish their own state. British\ntroops, United Nations troops and 'guarantees' having\nfailed to protect the Turkish Cypriots from 1963 to\n1974, they are justified in regarding Turkish troops\non the ground in Cyprus as the only reliable guarantee\nto their existence. The Turkish Cypriots accepted the\n1986 UN plan, which both the British government and\nthe Secretary General endorsed as a good basis for\na settlement, but the Greek Cypriots rejected it and\nstill hold out for 'better terms'.\nYours sincerely,\nFriends of the Republic of Northern Cyprus.\nNames withheld by request.\nDave!\ninterviews.\nJohn Patterson last week suggested you should\nreduce news coverage to save paper. I don't think that\nis possible. ICU's20 page newspaper has two pages\nof news, relegated to the front and back covers. You\nshould increase news coverage, and cut out the\nabove-mentioned dross.\nOh, and bring back the Baron.\nYours sincerely,\nUltan McCarthy, Physics 2.\nPS. Please confirm that the UGM on Thursday 7 will\nbe at 6pm. This seems a very silly time to hold it, even\nby ICU standards.\nDear Dave,\nHas Mark Page considered the possibility that FELIX\nmay not have printed the whole of the interview\nconducted with Miss NJ Fox about her reasons for\nresigning as the Chairman of the Conservative\nSociety. It is not unheard of to cut certain news items\nin order to make way for others deemed more\ninteresting to the average Imperial student.\nYours sincerely,\nAnita de la Motre, Chemistry PG.\nHand it\nover\nDear Dave,\nFollowing the article in last week's FELIX\nconcerning Mascotry, a meeting took place between\nthe two Unions concerned. At the meeting everyone\nrealised that there had been several\nmisunderstandings which lead to the article. We now\nfeel that its content was ill-considered.\nWe decided that our Unions will now communicate\nand cooperate on the handover of Davy.\nWe hope that this will lead to more understanding\nbetween the members of the two Unions, and we\nhope to have the handover early next term.\nYours sincerely,\nAnne Rothwell, Vice President RSM.\nCHR Randies, Vice President RCS.\nAlumnus Day\nBefore I started working at Imperial College, I always\nthought that the Alumnus Office was a faust y back room full of files collecting layers of dust. I was\nwrong. It is in fact an office of hectic bustle and\nhi-tech.\nThe word Alumnus derives from the Latin Alma\nMater meaning Educational Mother. Alumnus being\nthe child of the Alma Mater/University body.\nAlumni Relations is currently one of the fastest\ngrowth areas in UK universities with Imperial at the\nforefront. Although Imperial has long kept in touch\nwith its Alumni through the Old Student Association,\nthe Alumnus Office (part of the Development Office)\nhas only been in existence in its present form since\n1986. It was established to promote and enhance the\nrelationship the College has with its Alumni and now\nhas a database of 72,000 names and 36,000\naddresses worldwide. This is continually being\nupdated by an enthusiastic crowd of students\nemployed by the office.\nAlumni are kept in touch by a minimum of two\nPage 16\nmailings a year. A magazine is planned and other\nmajor projects are underway. The Imperial College\nAddress Book is imminent and will be published in\nthree volumes reflecting the three colleges, beginning\nwith City and Guilds.\nImperial has just launched its Telethon campaign,\nthe third to do so after Edinburgh and Oxford.\nDesigned to bring Alumni into closer contact with the\nCollege, a team of students phone Alumni giving them\nthe opportunity to air their views on Imperial, Alumni\nRelations and to donate to the Imperial College Fund,\nthe proceeds of which go to new student\naccommodation and young lectureship s. All the signs\nshow that it will be very successful. Each campaign\nwill be regional culminating with a social event. The\npresent campaign is centered on London with the\nLondon Alumni Reception at the finish.\nThis reception is being held on Friday December 8th as part of Alumnus Day-the climax of the Alumni\ncalendar. All Alumni have been invited to return.The\ndepartments will open at 2pm with displays and\nlaboratory demonstrations. In the Sherfield Building\nthere will also be displays from Archives, Press Office,\nContinuing Education, Alumni Fund as well as the\nOSA Hospitality Suite. The Queens Tower will also\nbe open especially for the day.\nAs this is the first year that this event is being held\nduring term, Alumni will be able to meet current\nstudents and we hope they will receive a warm\nwelcome.\nAlumnus Day, Friday December 8th.

    "content": "Ghostbusters II It's four years since the Ghostbusters saved New York\nCity from the evil 'gatekeeper'. Since then their lives\nhave taken a downward turn as the cost-conscious\ncity, faced with cleaning up the marsh a mallow, has\nslapped the heros with a judicial restraining order\npreventing them from g hos busting. When Dana Barrett (Sigourney Weaver) first met Dr\nPeter Venkman in Ghostbusters I, she told him 'You\ndon't act like a scientist...you're more like a game show host'. Unfortunately, she was right!\nVenkman (Bill Murray) has now been relegated to\nhosting a cable chat show on the paranormal.\nDana Barrett's relationship with Venkman fell apart.\nShe married another man, but that too fell apart,\nleaving her as a single parent with an eight month old\nboy, Oscar (played by the twins William T and Henry\nJ Deutshendorf). She is working at the Manhattan\nMuseum of Art with the distinctly odd Janosz Poha\n(Peter MacNicol).\nFormer Ghostbusters Dr Ray Stantz (Dan Aykroyd)\nand Winston Zeddemore (Ernie Hudson) have not\nfared well either. They're now entertaining at\nchildren's parties. Only Dr Egon Spengler (Harold\nRamis) has retained his integrity. He is continuing his\nresearch into the effect of human emotion on the\npsycho magnetic energy field. This is central to the\nstory as it is the hate and anger of the city dwellers\nthat is causing a surge in supernatural energy.\nFirst to be affected is Dana when Oscar's pram\ntakes off on it's own-straight into the oncoming\ntraffic. She manages to save Oscar, but who's she\ngonna call?\nOf course the Ghostbusers, along with their fearless\naccountant, Louis (Rick Moranis), and their ever\npatient secretary, Janine (Annie Potts), reform to help\nDana. They find the source of the disturbances, a river\nof slime, but fall foul of the law and end up in a mental\ninstitution. Who, or what, is going to save the city\nnow?\nI thoroughly enjoyed this film, though I thought the\nplot was a little thinner than in Ghostbusters I. Aykroyd, co-writing with Ramis, has concentrated\nmore on human behaviour this time, which means that\nalthough there are still some excellent special effects,\nthe quantity of ghosts is a little disappointing.\nTalking of ghosts, I was surprised to see Slimer, the\nfriendly ghost in The Real Ghostbusters cartoon,\nappearing on the Ghostbuster's side. This is odd, as\nin the first film, Slimer was aggressive, and was\ncaptured by the Ghostbusters. It means that this film\ndoes not follow directly on from the first movie, but\nif you haven't seen the cartoon don't worry, as this\nis a minor detail and won't spoil your enjoyment.\nThe film has some very funny moments, with\nMurray still delivering some excellent one liners.\nSigourney Weaver is still as stunning as ever, but the\nstars of the show have to be the twins playing Oscar.\nI wonder how they got them to fly like that?\nI left the cinema humming the theme tune (re-recorded by Run-DMC) and wishing that I too could\nblast some ghosts. I just had to see Ghostbusters I again and I can't wait until Ghostbusters II comes out\non video.\nToby Jones.\nWhen Harry Met Sally\nWhen Harry Met Sally..As a romance out of the classic\nHollywood mould. The ground rules may be different,\nthe time scale a little longer (11 years), but the result\nis never in doubt. The tale opens on the pair's first\nencounter, aged 21 and fresh out of college. They part\nafter several hours and do not meet up until five years\nlater. By this time each is well down the road to\nmarriage (to someone else). But worry not, we'll just\ntake a short break, and be back after the divorce. Their\nnext meeting is a further five years on, and both\nmarriages are conveniently in ruins. Harry and Sally\nfinally admit to being friends and the story plods on.\nThe film is loosely based on the experiences of the\ndirector Rob Reiner forced back into 'the Dating\nGame' by a recent divorce. It seemingly poses us with\ntwo questions: Can a man and a woman stay friends\nif they don't have sex? Can they stay friends if they\ndo? In divorce torn 80's America these are worthy and\nperhaps timely questions, but this film does not really\ndeal with them adequately. In defence it's funny, and\nat times hilarious. Billy Crystal {ex-Soap) gives an\nexcellent performance as Harry, sardonic, detached,\nand yet still sympathetic. Meg Ryan's portrayal of\nSally is a little more soggy, although she does have\nher moments. The climax comes (dare I say it) when\nSally, trying to persuade Harry of the prevalence of\nfaked female orgasms, stops eating her lunch to give\nan impromptu demonstration (watched in amazement\nby fellow diners), and then quietly resumes her meal.\nBy the time the film grinds its way to its self-imposed anti-climax, 'I love you because...' to\nchoruses of 'Auld lang syne' you feel that it has\nalready dragged on too long. It is interesting to note\nthe quote from ELLE was, 'Two hours of pure joy'.\nThe film is only 1 V2 hours long. I am sure that When\nHarry Met Sally... will be a commercial hit, not least\nbecause of its royal premier on Thursday, and its\nChristmas release, but there are better things to do\nwith your money.\nMatthew G Johnson.\nDead Calm\nHere is yet another film with a bit of sex, some\nviolence and a happy ending for all.\nWell, for everyone except the ship's dog and the\npsychopathic killer (Billy Zane). Oh, didn'tI mention\nhim before? He comes into the story when naval\ncaptain John (Sam Neil) and his wife Ray (Nicole\nKidman) discover an apparently deserted schooner\nwhich is rapidly sinking.\nZane rows to the couple's yacht and tells them that\nthe crew and passengers have died of food poisoning.\nBeing a typical gung-ho all conquering hero, and\ngenerally nosey g it, John decides to go and\ninvestigate, after locking our psycho friend in a cabin\nwith a pretty ineffectual door.\nOf course while John is busy finding dead bodies\n(food poisoning was definitely not the cause of death)\nand soft porn videos aboard the other ship, Zane\nwakes up and is slightly narked about being locked\nin a cabin. So, after an attempt at subtle persuasion,\nhe kicks the door down and, when he finds out where\nJohn has gone, decides to commandeer the yacht\nleaving John stranded to sink with the schooner.\nThe rest of the film is just a glorified chase, but it\nmust be said that there are some tense (if predictable)\nmoments. The acting is good, particularly the scenes\nin which the crazed killer tries to befriend Ray. Philip\nNoyce's direction is careful and precise, but why did\nhe include a shot of the ship's dog harpooned through\nits neck to a door when Dead Calm was only a15 certificate? Worth a look, but don't go out of your way\nto see it.\nDAN.\nPage 3\n\n"

    "content": "Bendover Turnip's boredom\nThe first round of College Athletic Committee and subcommittees have come and gone, and the result, I feel, is a11 draw. Boathouse committee-well, no\ndrastic changes there. Everything ticking along nicely,\nno major issues proposed which would affect, to any\nextent, the students using the facilities or the long-term future of the Boathouse.\nSouth Kensington Sports Committee-As a result\nof the income element of the Sports Centre's operations and financial targets set on this committee\nby Athletic Committee, discussion continues to be\ndominated by money. A few points raised about the\n'Development of the Sports Centre'-an extension to\nthe ladies changing rooms and the multi-gym, which\nhave now been completed. Viewpoints are very short-and middle-term. Where has that proposed multi-million pound sports complex gone? Thrown out of\nWestminster City Council and lost. But I hear talk of\na practical, scaled-down proposal for a sports hall. I feel further discussion and nurturing of this rather\ngood idea coming on during the year.\nOf course, the main issues on the table at the\nmoment concern Harlington, the remit of Athletic\nGround Committee. The good news-the Harlington\nTrust, set up to administer the funds provided from\nthe gravel extraction, will be making its first\ncontribution towards student sport at Imperial\nCollege. The Astroturf pitch is now on its way, to be\ninstalled in the summer term along with necessary\nfloodlighting and our own generator to provide the\nelectricity. Discussions centred on the exact\npositioning of the pitch are detailed in Neil\nMcCluskey's report in this issue of FELIX.\nFurther good news-there is around \u00a31.6 million\nalready in the Trust, being invested for us by Kleinwort\nBenson, with a projected total of about \u00a33.5 million.\nThe bad news\u2014the extraction is behind schedule,\nthe pitches on the Clubhouse (North) side of the road\nwill not all be ready for use for rugby and football until\nOctober 1991. The problem that they would not be\nsuitable for hockey for five years has been alleviated\nby the promise of the Astroturf. Streeters, the\ncontractors, want to start work on the pitches on the\nSouth side of the road as soon as the North side has\nbeen relaid (October 1990), but before the pitches are\nready for use. They obviously will not be digging up\nall the pitches on the South side at once but will dig\none strip at a time-the first strip will take three\npitches from us. Neil McCluskey and I recommended\na year's pause in the extraction to allow the North\npitches to catch up in the reinstatement process.\nHowever, this is difficult because Streeters would\nthen take their extraction equipment to another site\nand would not guarantee a return to Harlington. They\nare prepared to scale down their operations so that\nthis first strip worked on the South side would take\ntwice as long. It seems that this is the option which\nwe must accept because, although negotiations are\nunderway to pause operation for a year and guarantee\na return to the site, we must be sceptical about how\nsuccessful these will be.\nBenjamin Turner, ACC Chairman.\nIZIT another ents report?\nYou are so lucky. Yes, you! Whatever you had planned\nfor tonight, cancel it. You won't be disappointed.\nCome to the Union Lounge and see IZIT, the finest,\nfunkiest jazz band in this fair city. With a smokin'\nsingle at number 56, climbing up the charts, and a sound which makes you wish you could dance like\nJames Brown, IZIT have originality, where many others\nsimply re-hash standard grooves. Sitting still is not an\noption. Every note, every beat makes you want to get\nup and get down; believe me, I 've seen them.\nIf you thought that jazz is for old men, and that funk\nis a strong foreign lager, come along tonight, and all\nsuch thoughts will be blown sky high.\nDoors open at 9pm, disco till 2am and late bar.\nTickets are \u00a32 in advance from the Union Office.\nSatisfaction guaranteed.\nGet your diaries out, next Friday, the 8th, The\nMilltown Brothers will be playing live in the Union for\na showcase concert (lots of record company spies on\nthe guest list) as they are currently trying to secure\na major record deal. As the old clich e goes-see them\nat IC before they go pan-galactic.\nSeven days later, on the last Friday of term (15th), a Christmas extravaganza will grace our humble\nstage. The Energy Orchard have just signed up to\nMCA for lots of wong a, and are playing at College\nbefore a European tour to promote their debut album.\nThey played a storming gig here last year, we couldn't get them off the stage! Hard rockin' boys with bundles\nof energy (sic), and a bluesy melancholy re men is cent of Van the man. They love playing, you'll have a great\nnight.\nWell that's what we have lined up for you, do\nyourself a favour, BUY that ticket!\nRufus Isaacs, Ents Publicity.\nRag week was a success\nWhile exactly how much money Rag Week '89 raised\nhas not yet been extracted from the melee of events,\nit looks as though this year was one of the most\nsuccessful on record. By November 19th IC Rag\ncentrally had raised more money than the whole of\nlast year-well done all.\nThe Beer Festival (8th Nov) was very well attended\nand made over \u00a32,000. 1,200 people managed to\ndrink as much beer as last year before 9.30pm, which\nwas a bit of an under sight on our behalf. The Rocky\nHorror Disco was well attended, with a lot of audience\nparticipation during the film. If you didn't go you\nmissed Millan Lester (as Transport Officer) being the\nmotorbike in the Eddie scene.\nThe Hypnosis Lecture (10th Nov) was incredibly\nwell attended. A good night was had by all and we\nmade \u00a31,300, sorry for not opening the doors earlier.\nThe Poppy Day Collection was poorly attended but\nthose who went raised a lot of money-thanks to\nCath for driving. Sci Fi Marathon went well but while\nall the acts at the SACB Night were very good, the\nevent needs a few changes so that it can make more\nmoney in the future.\nThe Raft Race (Sunday 11th) was an absolute\nPage 8\nwheeze. Firstly I'd like to say thanks to Rob Rowe who\nwas the only miner to turn up (which makes-a three-way tug-o war a bit difficult). Then came the race at\na leisurely pace which RCS won. Then the police\nturned up and asked some rather awkward questions\nthat the people in charge couldn't answer properly (I had been delayed on the tube from Islington). Anyway\nthe police have so far said nothing, probably because\nthey found out that our telephone request to the DoE\nhad been processed wrongly\u2014a bit of a balls-up on\nour behalf.\nThe Comedy Night was well attended, but\nunfortunately not quite well enough as we made a loss. Thanks to James and James for organising it,\nnext year a different format will probably be tried. The\nSlave Auction (14th) went brilliantly, \u00a31,063 was\nmade-2y2 times last year's takings. At the Exec\nInitiative that afternoon everybody cheated lots (can\nI have all the cans back please). The Dirty Disco was\nthe storming do it always is.\nHit the Hit Squad was badly affected by the\nweather. Everyone enjoyed the Bar Quiz which went\nvery well and we'll probably do another one soon.\nThe Smoking Concert broke-even and RCS will be\ntrying a different format next year.\n\u00a315 was made by AeroSoc darts. Not many people\ntortured the members of the Exec who didn't wimp\nout (Carol Luscombe, Rob Rowe, Chris Home and\nRachel Smith) and not enough people turned up for\nthe monster boat race so all the free beer went\nbegging which was a bit pathetic,\nI'd like to say thank you to everyone who helped\nwith the Guilds Carnival, we don't know exactly how\nmuch we made. I'd also like to say thank you to\neveryone in Dance Club who raised squid oodles of\ndo sh for Children in Need.\nThe only event to start on the final Saturday was\nthe sponsored nude Kamikazi Parachute Jump in\nwhich three very brave people raised \u00a3750 for\nChildren in Need in seven minutes of glory-that's the\nspirit.\nSo that was Rag Week-the next Rag event is a Rag\nRaid to Canterbury tomorrow, fancy dress is optional,\nmeet at 10.30 in the Union van park. For further\ndetails please come to the Union Lounge this\nlunchtime.\nLove and Vodaphones,\nHal Calamvokis, Rag Chair 89-90.\n\n"

    "content": "Hockey Squash\nIC 1\n1\n1\n\u2014\n6 UCH II\u20140\nFresh from recent triumphs, IC went into\nWednesday's game in a confident mood. A crowd of\nthousands packed the Harlington stadium to see if the\n,team, which had won all its UAU games without\nconceding a goal, could continue their remarkable run\nby beating a strong UCH team. However, as the teams\nran out onto the pitch it was clear to all in the crowd\nthat this was a much changed IC team. Gone was IC's star centre forward, Indiana McGovern, replaced by\nthe virtually unknown Dave Millard. Also missing from\nthe line-up were Adam Pritchard, Rob Powell and\nJames Larkins, replaced by newcomers, Scott\nHipkins, Kevin Williams and Mike Marshal. But, by far\nthe biggest shock and disappointment to the crowd\nwas the relegation of Nigel to the substitutes bench.\nThe game started with a deafening roar of\nanticipation from the crowd. They were not to be\ndisappointed as IC soon stamped their superiority on\nBoat Club\n\u2022\nthe game with Kevin Hill converting a well executed\nshort corner routine after just ten minutes. The huge\nterritorial advantage enjoyed by IC did not however,\nbring another goal until a minute before the end of the\nfirst half when Jon Briggs' shot was stopped on the\nline by a foot. A flick awarded, Jon himself stepped\nup to slot the ball home for a20 lead at half time.\nAs the military band left the pitch, the second half\ngot underway. IC continued where they had left off,\nquickly making the score 3-0, Mike Marshal finishing\noff a goal mouth scramble. Three more goals were to\nfollow; a tap-in by Dave Millard, a second for Kevin\nHill-again from a short corner, and another for Mike\nMarshal-a superb shot from the edge of the 'D'. It seemed inevitable that more goals would follow\nbut it was not to be so, as the final whistle was blown\nto signify a60 victory, the players left the pitch to\na standing ovation and the crowd went home talking\nof the goals that might have been.\nICICSussex-1\nBarts-0\n\u2022\u2022'V' Last Sunday heralded the first competition for this\nyear's novice intake, in the University of London\nRegatta-the Allom Cup.\nThe men's eight was knocked out by an\nexperienced Hospital crew, but fortunately the men's four had more success and reached the final. They led\noff the start only to lose due to equipment damaged\non river debris.\nThe women's four reached their final without\ndifficulty and won despite an unwelcome bath\nafforded by a passing launch. The women's eight won\ntheir first heat by 5 lengths, but whilst in the lead in\nthe second round suffered a collision and were\nunjustly not awarded a re-row.\nIt is a promising start to the racing season for the\nclub's new oarsmen and women and it looks good for\nthe development of the novice squad during the year\nstarting as they have done from scratch. We hope to\nsee their training and dedication pay off as they strive\nfor greater heights.\nThe ladies squash team maintained their undefeated\nrecord last Wednesday afternoon with a win against\nSussex. This fifth and final UAU group fixture turned\nout to be the decider between the only two\nundefeated teams in the London/SW area. The\nafternoon started at one minute past twelve with a confident win for Liz Parkin, the team's number one\nplayer. The number two, Alison Smith, had a hard\nstruggle and eventually succumbed to the opposition.\nThis left the remaining three members, Toni Perrott,\nHan-Bing Cheong and Jenny Jolliffe, anxious for at\nleast 2 more victories to secure pole position in the\nsection and home tie in the next round. But the\nworries were uncalled for and they all secured easy\n3-0 wins.\nHot on the heels of this victory came another on\nMonday evening in the London league fixture against\nSt Bartholemew's Hospital when Imperial secured an\nimpressive 4-0 overall victory.\nX country\nDeveloped in Sweden, the Ledin Diet advocates a lean, mean and hungry approach to cross-country\nracing. That the IC boys have been following this\napproach assiduously was clear for all to see last\nWednesday at the London Colleges League. Despite\nsevere depletion due to injury, the team salvaged\nsecond place to maintain their overall lead in the\nleague.\nThe course was a testing five miles at Wimbledon\nCommon. A surprising leader at the quarter mile stage\nwas Dan McQueen. However, he didn't close, and slid\ndown to finish 72nd. Better pace judgement was\nshown by Paul Northrop, who ran a storming second\nhalf to finish a strong second. Alex made it two in the\ntop ten for IC, and Dave Ngugi put in another Stirling\neffort, although he later said he needed a DIC to surge\npast.\nHero of the B team was Jim Watson who improved\n32 places on his last run. True Harrier spirit was also\nshown by Steve Beverley, making the top 100 for the\nsecond time. He denied any involvement in the\nmysterious disappearance of the ladies team, but\nreferred instead to a certain E Gaskell from computing.\nTen Pin\nOver the last two weeks we have played two\nmatches, neither of which have been very\nspectacular. The first, against Brunei, we won 6-4.\nIt was a very close match and both the ladies and B team played very well with Roddy Winter in the B's scoring his highest ever of 211. Both the A's and C's came very close, both within 6 pins of an overall win.\nThe second match was against Kent University at\nhome. Unfortunately they managed to beat us by 8-2\npartly due to the absence of one of our best ladies.\nAlthough there was a valiant effort by the A team who\nwon all their games, with a special mention to Phil\nWren who played a587 series with two games over\n200. Overall we have managed to beat Kent in the\nleague.\n7\n\n"
