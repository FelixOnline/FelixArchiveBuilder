ICU is working\nclosely with the College to ensure that we make the most\nof this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and create a legacy\nthat we can all be proud of.\nTraditional College-wide Union events such as the\nSummer Ball, East Meets West and Artsfest will adopt a\ncentenary theme this year and whilst large events will\nform an important part of our events programme, it is\nequally essential that our faculty unions and as many\nclubs and societies as possible organise their own\ncentenary activities throughout the year. It is also vital\nthat we coordinate this plethora of celebratory activities\nin a sensible fashion and in order to achieve this we will\nbe distributing centenary advice packs to all of our clubs,\nsocieties and faculty union committees detailing how to\nrun centenary branded events in the very near future.\nPreparations for the Summer Ball, which is being branded\nas the \u201cCentenary Ball\u201d this year, are now underway and\nJon Matthews (Deputy President for Finance & Services)\nis presently recruiting students who may be interested\nin joining our working group. If you or any of your\nfriends may be interested in helping us with this event\nthen please contact Jon (dpfs@imperial.ac.uk). If you are\ninterested in any other aspect of the centenary project\nthen please feel free to email me (president@imperial.\nac.uk) or the centenary project manager and Medic\nPresident, sometimes a\ufb00ectionately referred to as DPMC\n(Deputy President for Medics & Centenary), Shiv Chopra\n(shiv.chopra@imperial.ac.uk).\nRemember; centenaries only happen once every 100\nyears! This is your one and only chance to get yourself\nor your club or society involved in this great occasion.\nSo, if you are even remotely interested in organising a\ncentenary activity this year then please get in touch with\nus as soon as possible.\nAnd finally - PLEASE VOTE!\nPlease do not forget to vote! The polls have just opened\nand can be accessed by logging on to our website:\nwww.imperialcollegeunion.org/vote. Voting closes at\n23:59 on Tuesday 31st and the results will be announced\nin Da Vinci\u02bcs at 12:30 on Thursday 2nd November.\nJohn Collins\nPresident\npresident@imperial.ac.uk\nUpdate\nfrom the President\nGet involved with the biggest party in the\nCollege, EVER!\nWe need volunteers to help in our Centenary Ball\nteam. If you think you can help then get in contact\nwith Jon Matthews, Deputy President (Finance &\nServices), dpfs@imperial.ac.uk.\nOn Friday the 13th November, a petition containing signatures\nof over 5% of the Full Members of this Union was submitted\ncalling for a referendum on whether or not Imperial should\na\ufb03liate to the National Union of Students. What does this\nmean? Well, in short, a hell of a lot of people have said that\nafter \ufb01ve years, it\u02bcs time you had your say. How many people is\nthis really? Think about every undergrad in Aero, then double\nthem, or the whole of EEE if double Aero is a bit too scary for\nyou, then add a few and you\u02bcll be just about there.\nSo what? Well, I\u02bcm not going to go into any of the arguments,\nthat\u02bcs not my job, but this is a big deal. You have the biggest,\n\u02bbbestest\u02bc and probably only chance (unless you end up hanging\naround here as long as I have) to change the way the Union is\nrepresented and seen on the national stage, or not. That\u02bcs the\nscale of what we are talking about.\nSo what about the good, the bad and the ugly? Well, the Procamp will be more than happy to tell you about the good, the\nAnti-camp about the bad, and I\u02bcm here in case it all gets ugly.\nIt\u02bcs your say that counts, you have a voice and we are listening.\nThe biggest decision this Union can ever take is going to be\nmade over \ufb01ve days in November. Teams of people are going\nto be trying to in\ufb02uence you and persuade you one way or\nanother, they will both have good arguments, they will both\nbe sure that they are right. Which of them are? That\u02bcs your\ndecision.\nFor the next three weeks, you are not going to be able to hide\nfrom the debate, those three little letters are going to become\nthe biggest thing to hit campus since Facebook.\nLive!, Felix and stoic tv will be featuring debates and\ndiscussions, the walkway will become a gauntlet of \ufb02ierers to\nput Oxford Street\u02bcs chuggers to shame, there will be public\ndebates between the two camps.\nIs this a good thing? Should you be allowed to just carry on\nwith your lunch or your mad dash to that lecture that started\n\ufb01ve minutes ago? Why should you vote? I\u02bcm not going to\nanswer those questions, but I will answer a di\ufb00erent one:\nWho doesn\u02bct need to vote? If your life is an Utopia to make\nSir Thomas Moore green with envy; if every evening you stroll\nback from your lectures along a coral beach into a sunset under\nwhich everyone dances together holding hands; if you truly,\ngenuinely live an untroubled existence of perfection in which\nnothing can change, then you don\u02bct need to vote. Everyone\nelse, this vote will a\ufb00ect you.\nLike the NUS or not, want to be\na part of it or would rather sever\nvital parts of your anatomy with\na blunt piece of cutlery, this vote\nwill a\ufb00ect you. Things are going\nto change for us all next year, you\nget to in\ufb02uence how. The good\nold IC apathy is well known by the\nolder hands amongst us, we\u02bcve\nseen it all before, some of us have\neven had this debate before. So\nwhat has changed? We\u02bcre in a\nwhole new ball-game now, we\u02bcre\nleaving ULU, Imperial is becoming\na University in its own right, tuition fees are changing. The old\ndebate is no longer valid, most of us here for the last one have\nleft. We need to see that the situation has changed and a new\ndebate is needed on both sides. Those of you who have joined\nImperial since the last referendum deserve your own say. There\nare people whom have joined Imperial since the last referendum\nyet graduated two days ago. A whole series of members have\npassed through, we have moved on and so must the debate.\nSo, how can you get involved? You can contact the leaders of\neither camp if you want more information or have already made\nyour mind up and want to help with the campaign. You can\nturn up to the public debates but most of all, you can vote.\nListen, think, vote. Please. Remember, our future is in your\nhands, that may sound melodramatic, but it really is\u2026\nJon Matthews\nDeputy President (Finance and Services)\nReturning O\ufb03cer, NUS referendum.\nJon Matthews\nDeputy President\n(Finance & Services)\ndpfs@imperial.ac.uk\nNUS \u2013 Good, Bad, or just plain Ugly?\nOnly you can decide\u2026\nTo contact the pro-campaign\nemail nus.yes@imperial.ac.uk\nTo contact the anti-campaign\nemail nus.not@imperial.ac.uk\nTo contact the Returning Officer\nemail elections@imperial.ac.uk\n\n"

It discusses the possibility of monitoring\nany Islamic society\u2019s leaflets and\nspeakers, and warns of the dangers\nof terrorists \u201ctalent-spotting\u201d on\ncampus and \u201cgrooming students\nfor terrorism\u201d.\nThe paper was leaked at a time\nwhen the Government is under\nstrain with regards to its attitude\ntowards British Muslims, after Jack\nStraw\u2019s request that a constituent\nremove her niqab (face-covering\nveil) when speaking to him resulted\nin outrage amongst many British\nMuslims.\nThe paper devotes a section to\nfactors that can drive students to\nextremism, and lists a number of\ncontributing reasons; these include\na feeling of \u201csegregation\u201d from British society, extremism in their original hometowns, and the influence of\nradical speakers. On the subject of\ninvited speakers, it advises keeping\na close eye on invited speakers and\ncommittee members: \u201cThe control\nof university or college Islamic societies by certain extremist individuals can play a significant role in\nthe extent of Islamist extremism on\ncampus.\u201d It worries that the influence of these \u201ccharismatic, persuasive and eloquent\u201d speakers can tap\ninto feelings of alienation common\nto students arriving at university.\nIt is true that extremists have\nbeen operating on campuses in the\nUK for the past few years. In the\nrecent foiled terror plot to blow up\nairlines travelling from the UK to\nthe US with explosives, one Islamic\nsociety president was arrested air\nside while allegedly trying to smuggle explosives on board an aircraft.\nIn a far less clear-cut case in 2003,\nBabar Ahmed, a Information Technology Support worker at the College, was arrested on charges under the Terrorism Act, and police\nraided rooms in Mechanical Engineering to seize computers. He is\ncurrently awaiting extradition to\nthe US. And at last year\u2019s Freshers\u2019\nFair, individuals acting under the\nname \u201cStop Islamophobia\u201d were\nattempting to recruit students for\nHizb ut-Tahrir, an Islamicist party\nthat was facing a ban under proposed anti-terror legislation.\nThe outcry over the leak has been\nwidespread. Gemma Tumulty, the\nNUS President, compared it to McCarthyism, adding: \u201cThey are going\ntotreateveryMuslimwithsuspicion\non the basis of their faith.\u201d Wakkas\nKhan, president of the Federation\nof Student Islamic Societies, worried about the lack of moderation\nshown by the paper: \u201cIt sounds to\nHalal food debate\nThe rising number of Muslims on\nBritish university campuses has\ncaused a surge in the number of\nuniversities serving halal food,\nthough some, including the Secular\nSociety at Oxford University, have\nprotested against the lack of options available.\nHalal simply means \u201cpermissible\u201d in Arabic; the act of halal\nslaughter is called dhabiha. This\nact involves first checking if the\nanimal is healthy; if so, the animal\nis given water to drink and pointed\ntowards Mecca. The slaughter man\nthen says a brief prayer, and slices\nopen the large arteries in the neck\nof the animal. This helps drain the\ncorpse of blood, as the consumption\nof blood is forbidden in Islam.\nAt Leicester University, students\nmanaged to get pork banned from\nthe union\u2019s food outlet, and all other\ndishes are now exclusively halal. At\nSheffield, a branch of Hally Ally\u2019s, a\nfast food company that serves only\nhalal food, has opened on campus.\nThe Union serves halal food, which\nis clearly marked on the menus. According to Jon Matthews, Deputy\nPresident (Finance & Services),\nsaid that chicken served by the\nUnion is \u201calmost entirely halal\u201d.\nIn College food outlets, the story\nis similar. In a statement made to\nFelix, a catering manger in College\nsaid: \u201cThe majority of chicken we\nserve is halal\u2026 beef and lamb are\nnot currently halal. We identify on\nmenus with an \u201cH\u201d all dishes that\nare halal.\u201d\nAt Oxford University, recently the\ncentre of a furious animal rights\nrow, some chefs have refused to\nprepare halal meat because of concerns over the way it is slaughtered.\nThe University\u2019s Secular Society\nhas also protested the introduction\nof entirely halal dishes, arguing that\none group\u2019s religious requirements\nshould not be forced on to another.\nMr Matthews responded to this\nconcern, saying: \u201cWe never have\nan entirely halal menu, so other options are available. Why would non-Muslim students care about halal?\u201d\nThe College caterer takes a similar\nline: \u201cAs the taste and quality is the\nsame as non-halal meat, this does\nnot affect the menu choices for our\nnon-Muslim customers.\u201d\nResearch into the dhabiha method of slaughter is inclusive with\nregards to animal suffering. While\nsome academics have stated it to\nbe one of the fastest methods of killing an animal, and that the draining\nof blood results in a relatively painless death, animal rights groups\ncontend that it causes unnecessary suffering compared to modern\nmethods that stun the animal prior\nto slaughter. The Governmentfunded Farm Animals Welfare\nCouncil has recommended that the\nconventional form of dhabiha that\ntakes places without any stunning\nshould be abolished.\nSome have raised questions over\nthe accommodation of Islamic eating habits, arguing that Jewish students should be able to obtain kosher food on campus. However, as\nMr Matthews says, this would likely\nrequire an entirely separate kitchen in order to ensure that milk and\nmeat are never handled together\nor with the same utensils, whereas\nhalal food requires far less work to\naccommodate.\nAlmost all the chicken served by the Union is now halal\nA leaked government paper suggests universities monitor\n\u201csuspicious students\u201d over fears of extremism on UK campuses\nme to be potentially the widest infringement of the rights of Muslim\nstudents that there has ever been\nin this country. It sounds like you\u2019re\nguilty until you\u2019re proven innocent.\u201d\nIn defence of the plans, Ruth Kelly,\nthe communities secretary, reiterated that academic staff were not\n\u201cspying\u201d but rather \u201cmonitoring\nstudents\u201d. Paul Mackney, joint general secretary of the University and\nCollege Union, also drew comparisons with the McCarthy era, and\nsaid the paper had \u201cmajor implications for academic freedom, civil\nliberties.\u201d\nA paper put to Union Council on\nMonday night by Camilla Royle, a\nstudent closely involved with SWSS\nand Student Respect, which condemned Islamophobia and asked\nthat the body got in touch with College authorities to ask whether students\u2019 details were being passed to\nSpecial Branch. It seems, however,\nthat those fears are misplaced. This\nreporter contacted Rees Rawlings,\nPro-Rector for Educational Quality,\nasking if there were any plans to\nmonitor affiliations of students or\nto specifically monitor Muslim students and societies. Mr Rawlings\nreplied succinctly: \u201cYour questions\nare simple to answer. The answers\nare no, and no.\u201d\nAndy Sykes\nRuth Kelly, communities secretary, has defended the plans\nChinese and Tibetan \u00e9migr\u00e9s protest outside the Royal Garden Hotel\nin Kensington High Street, where Chairman Jia Qinglin,responsible\nTibet policy, was meeting Tibetan spriritual leaders\nJOSH\nLEVINE\n2 felix Friday 27 October 2006\nNEWS news.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n\n"

    "content": "50th London Film Festival\nFelix provides the low down on everything cinematic that the BFI has on offer for you\nAs the fourth week of term grinds to\nan end, many will be getting bored.\nThe freshers\u2019 events are mostly\nover and the dull, aching rhythm\nof our respective courses has probably just begun to noticeably eat\naway at the abstract noun that we\nImperial students no longer refer to\nas a \u201clife\u201d. Never fear: there\u2019s something far more interesting to do.\nFor two weeks, London is the centre of the Cinema world. The Times\nBFI 50th London Film Festival will,\nby the time you read this, have\nswallowed Leicester Square, and a\ncavalcade of actors, directors, and\nbeautiful people will be waltzing up\nand down its long, red tongues.\nWhat\u2019s this I hear you cry?\n\u201cWorld-renowned film festivals are\nfor places like Venice and Cannes,\nnot the likes of us!\u201d\nHow very wrong you are. Even\nthough most of you have never\nheard of it, the London Film Festival is a prestigious event on the\ninternational film calendar, and\nthis is the 50th anniversary of its\ninaugural opening with Akira Kurosawa\u2019s Throne of Blood. Thus, with\nits line up of screening events and\nworld premiers, it is guaranteed to\nbe brain-smashingly good.\nIf you are still unconvinced, the\nfestival sweetens the deal with its\narray of amazing guests and speak-ers, including Dustin Hoffman, Tim\nBurton, Bob Hoskins, Jude Law,\nWill Ferrel, Martin Sheen, Gillian\nAnderson, Richard Linklater, Ben\nAffleck and Yo La Tengo.\nIn fact, the main problem with the\nfestival is deciding what to see. Unfortunately, as with all things in this\ngreat city, it isn\u2019t cheap (from \u00a37 to\n\u00a311 for most of the screenings); so\nwhittling down the number of films\nto an affordable number (from the\n180+ available) is painful. If you\naren\u2019t an all-knowing film buff with\na couple already picked out, the\nbest way to do this is to stick to\nthe Galas, special screenings and\nscreen talks.\nAt \u00a315 they are more expensive\nthan the normal screenings, but\nthey are truly red-carpet events; attended by members of the cast and\ncrew who give talks and Q&A sessions once the film has finished. It\nis a rare experience to see people\nstanding in front of you who were\non the screen mere moments ago;\nand to ask them, and the other creative forces, the questions that inevitably pop into your head during\na film. Among most promising of\nthese will be Babel, an epic drama\nstarring Brad Pitt, Cate Blanchett\nand Gael Garcia Bernal, created\nby the writer and director team responsible for Amores Perros and\n21 Grams; and Stranger Than Fiction, an intelligent comedy starring\nWill Ferrell, Dustin Hoffman and\nMaggie Gyllenhaal.\nWith the festival on our doorstep\nsuch gems cannot be ignored, no\nmatter how little time you claim to\nactually have.

As well\nas the two films, there was also a\nQ&A session with both directors.\nThe Signs is directed by Eug\u00e8ne\nGreen, who has been described as\n\u201cone of the best-kept secrets of current French cinema\u201d. This short\nfilm came about when he was asked\nto make a film inspired by a piece of\ncontemporary art. He chose a triptych of photographs by the Basque\nartist Maitetxu Etchevarria, and\nused them as inspiration for this\nstory about a family\u2019s vigil for the\nfather who has been missing for 10\nyears, presumed lost at sea. As Eugene discussed afterwards though,\nthe main focus of the film is really\nto communicate some of his ideas\nabout the universe, and how he believes that the universe has mean-ing, which we can discover if we are\nwise enough to recognise the signs\npresented to us.\nPetites R\u00e9v\u00e9lations, directed by\nMarie Vermillard, consists of a series of moments in the lives of various unconnected people, some very\nemotionally charged, others less\nso. Marie explained that she had\nbeen writing down these moments\nin her notebook for many years,\nand she made this unconventional\nfilm without a narrative to allow\nus to focus on the moods created\nby these various moments. Petites\nRevelations was generally agreed\nto be the favourite, the concept is\none of those things which can only\nreally be communicated effectively\nthrough the medium of film, it\u2019s\npretty much impossible to explain\nin writing!\nAnyway, if this article has managed to whet your movie appetite\nor tickle your cinematic tastebuds,\nthe festival is ongoing until the 2nd\nNovember. I urge you to get along\nand see one of the films showing.\nBecome a member of FilmSoc to\nget discounted cinema tickets on\nfuture trips as well as entrance\nto all our weekly screenings in\ncollege.

    "content": "minutes after the ambulance left, I realised that I shouldn\u2019t have taken that and\nlet my friend go to the hospital alone.\nIt turned out that my friend hadn\u2019t\nbeen take to St Mary\u2019s. The error\ncaused us distress and confusion for a\ngood half an hour, as we ran around the\ncity, trying to locate our friend. After\nabout two hours, the nurses dispatched\nus, telling my friend to rest and that\nnothing major was wrong.\nThe pain continued till Monday, when\nmy friend returned to his home country\nin Europe. From what his father told us\nthat evening, my friend was diagnosed\nwith a frontal spontaneous epidural\nhaematoma for the medics, and for the\nrest of us \u2018a leaking vein\u2019, and clotting\nblood was trapped under the skull suppressing the nerves around his brain.\nHe was in the operating theatre within\nthree hours of his plane landing in his\nhome city. A surgery to his skull was\npeformed, without which he would have\nbeen dead within a week, according to\nhis doctor. By the time he was back in\nuniversity again, all was well as before,\nexcept for a scar.\nThe reason I am publicising the incident is that I want everybody to know\nabout how you could be treated when\nyou call the ambulance, and be prepared if this happens. I also want to tell\nthe ambulance service of the unimaginable attitude of their staff. I don\u2019t think\nthat we should have been treated the\nway we were, given the circumstances.\nHealth is a priority as a student. Perhaps this article will prompt improvements in the future, make wardens in\nthe halls be aware that this happened\nor alternatively I\u2019m just making a fool\nof myself by calling the ambulance\nwhen I shouldn\u2019t. Whichever one it is,\nI will be glad if either one of us learns\nsomething.\nJournos of the\nworld unite\nI\nf you have been reading our esteemed publication over the past few weeks you will be aware\nthat student journalists are being persecuted by\nhigh-minded, arrogant sabbatical officers across\nthe country. We had the dubious pleasure of entertaining some of them last week when the Union Presidents of The Aldwych Group came all the way to South\nKen to have a chit-chat and a fairly uninspiring picnic.\nOur editor Andy attempted to discuss issues surrounding freedom of the press in their constituencies. Unsurprisingly the few that he approached did not seem too\nenthusiastic to discuss these matters with ULU President Vicki Slater becoming particularly defensive when\nasked about the future of London Student.\nWho on earth these people think they are and why they\nshould be protected from lowly newspaper columnists is\nbeyond me. What is important though is that the student\npress remains united in the face of such brazen hostility\nfrom bruised political egos. Imperial College has a long\nand proud history of a free press. In addition to Felix\nwe have our own television channel, radio station and a\nthriving news server, Live (live.cgcu.net), run by City &\nGuilds College Union. As you have probably noticed the\nupcoming referendum on NUS affiliation has sparked a\nfierce debate which continue to be fought through these\npages and Live contains several well-informed articles\non this subject, amongst others. This is why I am very\npleased that Live and Felix are now working more closely than ever before, with Felix now \u201csyndicating\u201d contributions to their website which will now also link to articles that have appeared on these hallowed pages. Live\nare in the process of setting up a webpage that will give\nboth sides of the debate with contributions from both the\n\u201cNo\u201d campaign team and the Imperial College Union\nLabour Supporters Network, or the \u201cYes\u201d campaign, as\nthey prefer to be known. If you are interested in the debate on the NUS and how much it will cost our clubs and\nsocieties I would recommend that you have a look.\nAlong similar lines, I find the following information\nrather curious. Both a senior Union source and a prominent member of the Yes campaign have stated that NUS\nactivists who are invited to campaign in favour of joining\nwill be \u201cscreened\u201d. This is because they are aware that\nthe typical NUS activist (a highly political, loony left Polyversity arts student) will not go down too well with your\naverage Imperial student (apathetic, studies a \u201cproper\u201d\ndegree, will be able to obtain gainful employment). If we\nare talking about joining an organisation then surely we\nshould have the honour of seeing a wide cross section of\nits activists and not just the ones least likely to piss us\noff? What is even more startling is that those in favour\nof joining are so aware the negative aspects of the NUS\nthat they have to plan their campaign to minimise their\nimpact. Sounds a bit shifty to me.\nIn reply, about the veil\nR\necently, a friend of mine\nin halls came down with a\nheadache that his doctor diagnosed as an eye infection,\nsaying he shouldn\u2019t worry\nabout it. Three days later the pain in-creased, and the hospital told him that\nit was probably sinusitis. Then, on Saturday, I found him moaning in pain and\nincapable of doing anything due to the\nthrobbing pain in his head. As a result,\nhe had not eaten or slept for more than\nthree days. The situation continued into\nthe evening, when a friend and I decided to take him to the hospital.\nI stood on Exhibition Road for more\nthan ten minutes trying to hail a cab\nwith no success, so, reminded how horribly torturing my friend\u2019s pain was, I\ndecided to call an ambulance.\nI\u2019ve never called an ambulance before,\nknowing that it is a valuable resource\nnot to be taken lightly. However, being\nfirst year students in a foreign country\nin excruciating pain and having no other means of traveling seemed to justify\nthe use. I dialed; the lady on the other\nend asked me some standard questions\nSamuel Lynas responds to Omar Hashmi\u2019s comments about Jack Straw\nand notified me that an ambulance was\non its way. I was really appreciative of\nthe kind and supportive service, but my\nperspective on the NHS changed when\nthe ambulance arrived and the whole\nevening just went downhill.\nThe two drivers walked out of the am-bulance. I greeted the drivers, whose\nexpressions immediately changed\nwhen they saw us. They started to demand who called the ambulance, and\nI, upon confirming, received a bashing\nabout how the situation was inappro-priate: my friend wasn\u2019t bleeding, was\nconscious, and was able to walk (albeit\nbarely) \u2013 basically the situation wasn\u2019t\nlethal enough.\nThey shouted at the patients for being cheap students who took advantage\nof the system, instead of taking a cab.\nWe apparently wanted to save money\nby calling an ambulance. My friend\nrecalled being told on the way to the\nhospital that the drivers scolded him\nfor depriving people who are having\nheart attacks and bleeding to death of\nthe service and that he could be legally\nsued for this abuse.\nI was shocked at this unexpected at-tack; didn\u2019t the university say that we\nshould not be afraid to ask for help on\nthe first day? And the medical centre\nwho said no emergency was too small?\nI explained unavailability of taxis to the\ndrivers, who disregarded it as a lie, and\npushed the patient into the ambulance\nin the manner that police treat crimi-nals. When my friend and I followed,\nthe drivers pushed us away, telling us\nto take a taxi to the hospital to give us a\nlesson that ambulances are not free.\nI asked which hospital, and they replied St Mary\u2019s. I was abhorred at this\ntreatment and too shocked to demand\nthe response that we deserved. As my\nfriends and I climbed into a taxi ten\nR\neading and re-reading Omar\nHashmi\u2019s opinion piece of\nlast week on the current\ndebate stirred up by Jack\nStraw\u2019s comments on the\nwearing of the Muslim veil (\u201cWeighing\nin on the veil issue\u201d, Felix 1360), I felt\nan unexpected surge of empathy in response to his question: \u201cTo what end\ndoes it serve [sic] making some look dif-ferent, isolated, weak and suspicious?\u201d\nLet us leave to one side the obvious objection that it is not Jack Straw\u2019s comments but the veil itself, which makes\npeople look different, and, dare I say it,\nsuspicious. What Mr Hashmi is in essence asking is: \u201cWhat can Jack Straw\nhope to achieve by putting these women\nunder the spotlight?\u201d This is indeed a\nlegitimate question, and one I feel I can\nanswer.\nJack Straw has fired a salvo at what\nwould, in military parlance, be referred\nto as a target of opportunity, that is to\nsay, a target made attractive not by its\nintrinsic value but by its vulnerability.\nAs unassimilated \u2013 and arguably unas-similable \u2013 Muslim populations represent an ever-greater threat to the security of many Western European states,\neven those as marinated in the miasma\nof multiculturalism as our current government have finally realised that the\nramifications of leaving this problem\nunchecked could be horrendous.\nBut how best to confront it? Should\nwe, perhaps, make a bold stand against\nthose who insist we consign traditional\nideas of freedom of speech to the trash-can, as demanded by irate Muslim communities throughout Europe (and the\nworld) during the Salman Rushdie and\nMohammed cartoon crises? Should\nwe introduce new legislation to explicitly ban the criminal practice of forced\nmarriages, rather than relying on a potpourri of existing legislation relating to\nkidnap and the like?\nOf course not. For this might bring\nus into contact with the bad-tempered\nmen with the placards, their faces contorted with rage at the discovery that\nthere exist people on this planet who\nhave the temerity to question their beliefs and values. This clearly being an\nunacceptable option, Jack Straw has\nwisely (albeit cravenly) decided to hack\noff that part of the problem that looks\nlikely to yield the greatest benefit for\nthe least cost. Hence his comments\nabout the veil, an ultimately harmless\nitem of only secondary interest at best.\nSuch are the times we live in.\nI will not expect Mr Hashmi to share\nmy opinions of the problems that Islam\nposes for Britain and other European\ncountries; indeed, he has made it clear\nthat he does not. However, in the spirit\nof the communication he hopes to en-gender, I will express my alarm that he\nseems puzzled by the idea that people\nwith different \u2018core values\u2019 or who favourdifferent\u2018systemsofgoverninglife\u2019\ncould be a danger to society. What, one\nwonders, could conceivably constitute\nan internal threat to a society, any soci-ety, if not those very things? What does\nhe believe underlies the turmoil that\nleaps out at us from the pages of virtually any history book? Leprechauns?\nMr Hashmi goes on to inform us that\nas long as conversation between seemingly opposed groups is \u201cconservative,\nsuitable and necessary\u201d, it should be\n\u201cfine\u201d. But this slightly sinister and\nvaguely authoritarian wording is a manifestation of the problem, not a route to\nits solution. Many Muslims, it seems,\ncannot help but insist that interaction\ntake place on their terms. No Mohammed jokes, no bombs in turbans, no Satanic Verses, no unsolicited comments\nabout the veil, no exceptions. Where do\nwe think we are? Britain? These days,\none rather wonders.\nAs for the tired old claim that it is always the actions of others that account\nfor the violence of Muslims, perhaps Mr\nHashmi could explain why Sunni and\nShi\u2019a Muslims are so intent on slaughtering each other in Iraq and other Muslim countries over a succession dispute\nthat took place over 1300 years ago in\nthe sands of Arabia. If some Muslims\nare prepared to kill each other for such\nfarcical reasons, is it unreasonable to\nsuggest that still others might be prepared to kill non-Muslims on the basis\nof even less legitimate grievances? Mr\nHashmi might do well to consider the\npossibility. As might the rest of us.\nNHS ambulance nightmare\nFelix, Beit Quad, Prince Consort Road, London SW7 2BB. Tel 020 7594\n8072. Fax 020 7594 8065.

    "content": "6 felix Friday 27 October 2006\nGLOBALLY SPEAKING environment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nIn the small town of Mirpur north\nof the capital Dhaka, famous for its\nmango trees, homemade bombs\nkilled over 20 people. In Kansant, a\nsmall village, hundreds fought with\npolice, and 7 were killed. In the suburb of Dhaka, thousands took to the\nstreets in protest; a local MP was\nviolently wounded. Over 500 people\nhave been injured in such riots in\nthe last two months. The Bangaldeshi people are fighting for their\nright to a reliable source of energy.\nOver 18 power plants are currently shut down for repair and maintenance and the countries generating\ncapacity is barely reaching half of\nthe current demand. The challenges of numerous blackouts, sometimes lasting several hours a day,\nhave been particularly strenuous\nduring the holy month of Ramadan\nwhich sees people fast in extreme\nheat. The lack of electricity for even\ncooling fans has pushed the masses\nto breaking point.\nThe energy crisis is not the only\nchallenge that Bangladesh is fac-ing; its water and transport infrastructure has been found lacking,\n24 percent of the population are living under extreme income poverty\nand the country is in serious political turmoil. Over the last year we\nhave witnessed an average of one\nmass strike per week. It is this web\nof intrinsically connected obstacles\nthat has made solving the energy\ncrisis an altogether monumental\nchallenge, one that several energy\nministers have tried to take on\nbut have resigned promptly after\nappointment.\nThe electricity provision in BangJignesh Parekh\nEngineers Without Borders\nBangladesh: the fight for energy\nAccording to the College\u2019s Energy\nand Environmental Services web-site, energy management and environmental services on campus are\nkey issues to Estates. Imperial College Estates promises to provide\nup-to-date information about its energy and environmental performance and its initiatives to reduce\nenvironmental impacts and reduce\nenergy costs and consumption.\nAll of this sounds perfectly reasonable and for anyone who doesn\u2019t\nknow better the College is probably\nkeeping to its promises. However,\nif you take a moment to investigate\nthe topic you will find that the College\u2019s \u2018up-to-date\u2019 information is insignificant at best.\nAccording the Energy Management Policy website, \u201cImperial\nCollege is a world-class teaching\nand research institution providing\nscientific and technical excellence,\ninnovation and solutions for the global needs of the 21st century. Best\npractice in energy management\nwill become increasingly important\nin support of this position.\u201d\nHowever, this spirit is rather\ncontradictory to the website infor-mation, which doesn\u2019t include the\nenergy policy itself. Worse still,\nsome of the web links, for example\nthe College\u2019s Carbon Management\nProgramme, have expired.\nJo\u00e3o Vitor Serra\nGlobally Speaking Editor\nEmbracing the environment\n\u25a0 The average household\nspends approximately \u00a3400\non energy bills during the\nwinter (October - March). This\nis about a third more than\nan energy efficient home.\n(Source: ETSU)\n\u25a0 By turning down your\nthermostat by 1C, or using\none hour less heating a day,\nyou could cut your fuel bills\nby 10%.\n(Source: BRECSU)\n\u25a0 If everyone boiled only the\nwater needed to make a cup\nof tea rather than filling the\nkettle, we could save enough\nelectricity to run practically\nall the street lighting in the\ncountry.\n(Source: DETR)\nladesh has been seen to suffer from\nvariable voltages, poor operating\nefficiencies, significant load shedding and poor tariff and billing pro-cedures. All review indicators have\nbeen towards a lack of investment\nin the country\u2019s power generation infrastructure. With expected\ndemand to increase by 60% in the\nnext 6 years it is expected that an\ninvestment of over 10 billion pounds\nis needed by 2011 to reach a target\nof reliable energy by 2020. It is a\nsum so large that the government\nhas little choice but to look towards\ninternational donors and private investors to replenish the countries\npower infrastructure.\nBut Bangladesh isn\u2019t the easiest\nplace to invest, with alleged issues\nof corruption, beauracracy and\nmisinformation all plaguing the\ngovernment. Whilst Chinese companies have been seen to finance\nand implement projects success-fully, such as a recent 100 million\ndollar transmission refurbishment\nproject, others have been withdrawing investments, including\nthe Indian company Tata. However,\ninvestors don\u2019t seem to be coming\nout with flying colours either; they\nhave often accused of exploiting the\nnations resources. The American\ncompany Occidental had a major\npipeline explosion in 1997 and the\nmatter of compensation for environmental damage has still not been\nresolved, and a similar case exists\nfor the Canadian company Niko Resources as well. Asia Energy PLC\nhave looked to initiate an open pit\ncoal project which displaces over\n40,000 people over the next 10 years\nwhich has caused much anger from\nlocal village communities. There is\nan uncertain and potentially violent\nfuture for the Bangladeshi people;\nThe Bangladesh energy crisis has left 27 people dead and over 500 injured in the last 2 months\nHousehold\nheat loss\nand there seems to be a lack of solutions being delivered. The government has set in place several short\nterm measures, including enforced\nblack outs for \u2018unimportant\u2019 indus-tries, which are seemingly frustrating the situation further. It is ironic\nthat a country with rich natural gas\nis unable to meet its own power requirements due to ultimately a lack\nof good governance and professional technical and management\nhuman resources who are able to\ndeliver solutions in these difficult\nsocial conditions.\nThe world should perhaps take\na serious note of violent repercussions of energy shortages that we\nare witnessing in Bangladesh, for a\nsimilar situation may not be too far\nfor others, the UK included.\nNote to Reader:\nI am not an informed expert in the\narea of Bangladesh\u2019s energy situation and would like to apologise\nfor any misrepresentation given to\nthe reader.

    "content": "This year\u2019s Gliding Club tour happened to start on the longest day\nof the year. Lasham, our home air-field, had decided to try and get as\nmany flights into the day a possible,\nwhich was handy; not only did the\nearly morning start seem more\nbearable but some of us even managed to go flying before leaving! A\nlargely uneventful journey across\nBelgium, Germany and Austria\nfound the group in Nitra, Slovakia.\nNitra is about 60km west of the\ncapital Bratislava and 8km away\nfrom the Tribec Mountains. The\nairfield has hosted numerous World\nand European gliding champion-ships, so has very good facilities\nincluding a swimming pool and a\ntennis court (very useful when you\nweren\u2019t flying). We stayed on the\nairfield in chalets, which were only\n20m from where the glider trailers\nwere parked, so we could easily\nfall out of bed each morning and\nassemble our single seater Discus\n(no assembly required for our twin\nseater, 496, which was either in the\nhanger or trestled overnight). The\nairfield doesn\u2019t have any catering\nfacilities (only a bar), but we were\nable to get food at Nitra\u2019s two Tescos, one of which was actually on\nthree separate floors! We went out\nmost evenings and attempted to\nsample some of the more local cui-sine, including an Italian, a Mexican\nand an Irish restaurant (the origins\nof the Irish one were questionable),\ntwo homemade barbeques, and a\nvery good local restaurant where, if\nyou ordered 2 days in advance, you\ncould get a whole suckling pig. One\nfact that seemed to pass most of the\nrestaurants was that when Sage\nsaid he was vegetarian, this means\nhe eats no meat (Slovakian dishes\n\u2018without meat\u2019 may just contain less\nmeat). We also made evening trips\nto Bratislava and Banska Bystrica;\nthe latter is a historic town in the\nmiddle of the Tribec Mountains.\nSome of us later returned to Bratislava on a poor weather day whilst\nthe others climbed the local ridge.\nThe first day was spent flying\nwith instructors in the twin seater,\nto make sure everyone was safe to\nfly on their own. Launching was by\nwinch, where the glider is hooked\nonto a mile long cable which is\nreeled in at 60mph to catapult you\ninto the air. The Nitra winch was\nnot the smooth, powerful launch\nwe\u2019re used to at home (the average launch was to a pathetic height\nof 700 feet), and was initiated by\nswinging a very heavy metallic bat\naround your head. The problem\nwas the winch driver could barely\nsee this bat from the other end of\nthe airfield, so some people found\nthemselves standing there waving for more than 5 minutes! Once\nunder way the sticky clutch caused\nsome jerky launches, and having\nbroken every weak link (a replaceable part on the cable designed to\nbreak before the glider does) on the\nairfield we decided not to use the\nwinch again. The rest of the launches were by aerotow, a more sedate\nway of getting airborne where a\npowered aircraft tows your glider\nup to altitude.\nGenerally the weather was superb by British standards, with fantastic soaring conditions allowing\nus to stay in the air for more than\n5 hours at a time by riding on columns of rising hot air. This allowed\nthose who were pre-solo to do a lot\nsoaring practice and upper air work\nwith instructors, and those who\ncould fly the single seater were able\nto practice their soaring and go for\nbadge claims. There were a daring\nfew (mainly flying with Bob) that\nwent out to the local ridge. I say\ndaring because, as we saw when\nwe climbed it, if the ridge lift wasn\u2019t\nstrong enough to keep the plane up\nit would be a long way to glide back\nto the airfield with very little height\nto spare!\nThe locals were all very friendly\nand helpful, and the youth contingent even allowed us to join in their\ndrinking games; their shot glasses\nwere the size of tumblers and the\nhomebrew was lethal (the normal\n8 hour minimum before flying was\nnowhere near a long enough recovery time!)\nOverall, everyone there got something out of it. Pre-solo students\nwere able to learn in a familiar glider in superb conditions and those\nwho flew the Discus were able to\nhone their thermalling skills. Thank\nyou to Bob and Sage for their hard\nwork instructing and mentoring\nduring the first two weeks; Sage\neven managed a bit of flying of his\nown in the last week when he had\nno one to instruct!\nUp, up and\naway with IC\nGliding Club\nAn unusual choice of holiday destination\nperhaps, but Slovakia managed to provide\nsoaring skies for everyone involved\nImperial College Gliding Club\nmeets every Friday lunchtime\nat 12.30-13.30 in Aeronautical\nEngineering room 254, and\nwe fly on both days of every\nweekend as well as Wednesday\nafternoons.

Charles Fedrick Worth was\nthe first dressmaker who, instead of\ncopying the popular designs of the\nday from illustrated journals, would\nimpose his own taste on women.\nHe was also the first designer to\nthrow a fashion show, using attractive young women as \u201csosies\u201d, effectively inventing the model. He\nwould dress woman popular in high\nsociety to create a buzz about his\ndesigns, much in the same way designers today give the latest it-bag\nto the latest it-celebrity.\nBut are high fashion labels like\nDolce & Gabbana, Yves Saint Laurent and so relevant any more?\nTrends move so fast these days that\nhigh street stores have the upper\nhand in staying ahead of the trends.\nPeople don\u2019t want clothes that last\na lifetime; they buy clothes that are\nfashionable for the season.\nAre people even being inspired\nby designer catwalks? Especially\nin this media-saturated age, people can get their inspiration eve-rywhere. The internet means that\nwe don\u2019t need designers to travel\nacross the world to find the latest\nlook. People don\u2019t need catwalks to\ndictate their look. Unless, of course,\nyou\u2019re Victoria Beckham, who copies entire outfits from the catwalk:\nwhat a style icon. The latest trends,\nleggings for example, have come\nfrom \u201cthe street\u201d.\nEven if designer stores aren\u2019t as\nquick to move as the high street, are\nthe clothes at least of a better quali-ty? Or the designers any better? It\u2019s\nscandalous that Ralph Lauren can\ncharge \u00a350 for a plain white vest\ntop while an identical high street\nversion is a fraction of the price. A\nlot of the time high street and high\nfashion labels even share the same\nfactory. It\u2019s sewing on the designer\nlabel that costs the extra \u00a340.\nIt\u2019s doubtful that designer labels\nrepresent the cream of the world's\ncreativity. If you really want a great\ndesign, high fashion labels are the\nlast place to go. For something of\nhigher quality than the usual high-street fare, it would be smarter to\nhead to a boutique that stocks a\nrange of lesser known labels. You\nget a sense of exclusivity from the\nfact that the brands are small, as\nopposed to the sense of exclusivity from buying something that\nthe majority of the world can\u2019t af-ford. It\u2019s pretty superficial to want\nsomething that\u2019s merely priced to\nDesigner or high street?\nAre people shunning heavily advertised \u201chigh-fashion\u201d labels, asks Sarah Skeete\nbe exclusive. That\u2019s how you end\nup with the nouveau rich from Russia dressed head to toe in designer\ngear, yet only managing to look like\nupper-class chavs. Money does\nnot buy style. Witness the decline\nof Burberry once the distinctively-patterned baseball caps were colonised by chavs. Nobody wanted to\ntouch Burberry because the sense\nof exclusivity had gone. This type\nof branding, where the label is\nworth more than the design, leads\nto counterfeits flooding the market.\nPeople seem to be moving further\naway from the ostentatiousness of\nheavily-branded goods, towards\nclothing that subtly hints at better\ntaste.\nDesigner labels just don\u2019t have\nthe same cache that they did in the\npast. They brand you as a fashion\nvictim. Granted, their advertisements are more seductive than\never, but aren\u2019t consumers smart\nenough to separate the ads from\nthe brand? Those Calvin Klein jeans\nlook hot on a half-naked model, but\nso would a pair from Oxfam. People understand that adverts aren\u2019t\nrepresentative of the brand. Even if\nthe advertisements are quite crea-tive, what does that say about the\nbrand? They\u2019re created by an outside agency. Diesel\u2019s adverts have\nalways been quite interesting. Their\nfirst adverts, featuring the slogan,\n\u201cDiesel: For Successful Living,\"\nwere intended to make fun of all the\nimprobable advertising promises of\nthe past. I think it\u2019s an interesting\nsell, but that doesn\u2019t mean I have\nany of their clothes hanging in my\ncloset. In fact in the past few years\nthe most successful jeans have\nbeen boutique brands from New\nYork & California who haven\u2019t spent\na dime on advertising; brands like\nPaper Denim & Cloth, Seven and\nRock & Republic.\nWe\u2019re lucky that here in Britain\nwe have a lot of choice between\nhigh street and designer labels.

    "content": "The Game On exhibition\nAn inspired recollection of gaming history or a chance for more Nintendo marketing?\nThe facts don\u2019t entirely speak for\nthemselves, but they allege that\nthere are 26,500,000 gamers in the\nUK. This ranges from the hardcore\ndenizens of Azeroth right through\nto the Brain Trainers and businessmen who play Sudoku on their\nphone. Whether or not all of these\npeople are truly \u2018gamers\u2019 is a debate in itself, but the numbers do\nsay this \u2013 gaming, in one form or\nanother, is a part of the nation\u2019s psy-che. And if it\u2019s technological history,\nthen the Science Museum want to\nplay host to it.\nBut if you\u2019re not convinced by the\nnumbers, you might be wondering\nwhy the exhibition is gracing the\nmuseum at all. Gaming still has its\nneuroses and its stigmas attached,\nand even without them it can still\nseem all too Pop Culture. Has the\nScience Museum sold out?\n\u201cI think it\u2019s very important to actually look at Game On beyond just\nwhat\u2019s in [the exhibition], but also\nthe whole museum.\u201d Explains David Yarnton, the General Manager of\nNintendo UK, speaking at the exhibition\u2019s opening, \u201cThe important\nthing [Nintendo] see in games, and\nthe reason why we want to be here,\nis because we think of games as\nsomething that gives young people\nthe opportunity to get inspiration\nand have fun.\u201d\nIf nothing else, Mr. Yarnton knows\nthe Science Museum\u2019s intentions\npretty well. The exhibition itself is\ndraped in cool blues and bright colours for the most part, with vibrant\nmurals by Jon Burgerman \u2013 an\nartist who has worked for Sony in\nthe past \u2013 and it\u2019s these that really\nunderline the direction of Game\nOn, highlighting the content of vid-eogames, challenging the long-held\nstereotypes and clich\u00e9s, and asking\nquestions of the future.\nBut of course, it\u2019s the games that\nare the focus \u2013 Space Invaders is\nprojected at an impressive scale\nonto the walls, lively platformers\nsuch as Jak And Daxter share floor\nspace with old classics such as\nElite. It\u2019s an eclectic mix of the past\nand the present, offering a whistle-Rock on. Suits wah-wah their whammys on Guitar Hero for the PS2 at the Game On Exhibition\nstop tour of most of the last decades\nof gaming.\nIn Mr. Yarnton\u2019s opening speech,\nhe hinted at the relationship between the exhibition and the wider\nmuseum. He described gaming as\nsomething \u201cwhere kids, by having\nfun, [gain] inspiration to further\nthings in the future.\u201d, and made\nmention of the drop in interest in\nscience across the board. \u201cIt\u2019s so\nimportant, I think, at the moment,\nand I read all the time in the papers\nabout young people\u2026 but it\u2019s so important that we get them involved\nand participating towards innovation in the future.\u201d\nLater,IfindDavidBrabenwandering somewhat bemusedly through\nthe exhibition. He talks to me about\nthe exhibition, and about what gaming has been for him in the past two\nand a half decades. In front of us,\nthe Elite console that he donated\nto Game On glows and sparkles.\nIs there still scope for technological innovation and development in\nthe future? Is there still a future for\nscience in gaming? \u201cWe don\u2019t even\nknow where the \u2018scope\u2019 is,\u201d he says,\n\u201cThis exhibition is a milestone, it\nshows that we\u2019ve reached a turning\npoint. But it\u2019s no more than the end\nof the beginning.\u201d\nIt\u2019s worth noting that the exhibition is sponsored by Nintendo itself \u2013 this doesn\u2019t just mean that\nthey get exclusive sketches of Donkey Kong and Mario. It also means\nthat the exhibition is distinctly lacking in the areas that Nintendo don\u2019t\ncover. Metal Gear Solid, Half-Life,\nQuake, even Doom are all conspicuously absent, and the most\nrecent Final Fantasy they could\nmuster was a Playstation conversion of FFVI. The exhibition still\ndoes its job of highlighting some of\nthe great moments in videogaming\nhistory \u2013 but it also has a few pages\nmissing, particularly as you go on\nthrough time.\nIn the final chamber of the exhibi-tion, a projector throws out Guitar\nHero, two-player, onto a screen.\nSchoolkids and Suits strum away\nto Franz Ferdinand, both equally\namazed and confused by the flurry\nof sound and colour. For all its poor\nlighting and lack of seating, Game\nOn is still a charming exhibition of\ngaming, and offers a few very rare\nchances to glance upon some very\nspecial pieces of gaming history.\nFrom Grand Theft Auto III concept\nart through to Spacewar! and an\noriginal PDP-1, there are some real\ngems. But it\u2019s unlikely to come into\nits own until the Wii and Playstation3 are released, as this will make\ntheir collection finally complete.\nIt comes at an interesting time,\na time when gaming is partially\nembraced by consumers in gen-eral, but still at threat from legal\nand moral minefields both at home\nand further afield. Game On fails to\nchallenge the image of gaming very\nwell, and it\u2019s claim of \u201cevery game\nworth playing\u201d similarly doesn\u2019t\nring true. But it remains a beautiful and rare tour-de-force of some of\nthe lesser-travelled paths in gaming history.\n\u201cIt\u2019s exciting,\u201d Braben explains,\nwith a smile that hasn\u2019t dulled over\n24 years of working in the indus-try, \u201cTo write games, to play them.\nWe\u2019re just beginning.\u201d\nGame On, like the industry itself,\nstill has a lot of work to do.\nMike Cook\nThe Game On exhibition runs\nfrom 21 Oct 2006 until 25 Feb\n2007 at the Science Museum.\nEntry costs \u00a38.50 for adults\nor \u00a36.50 for children and concession entry. Family tickets\nare also available.\nOpening times are from\n10.00 until 18.00 with specific\nextended special events during November.\nBooking can be made online\nat www.sciencemuseum.org.\nuk or by telephone on 0870\n906 3890.

Recent geological evidence confirms\nthat for thousands of years, generations of women in ancient Greece\nwere acting crazy and becoming\nfamous for it.\nDuring the 8th century B.C. the\nDelphi temple in Greece became\ninternationally famous for the\nprophetic powers of Pythia \u2013 the\npriestess who sat on a tripod,\ninhaled toxic vapours and babbled\npredictions of the future. Over hundreds of years, the various Pythia\nat Delphi were consulted for advice\non many major decisions and were\nthe most prestigious and authoritative oracles in the Greek world.\nRecent geological investigations\nhave provided some suggestions\nof the source of the Pythia\u2019s deranged behaviour. Two major fault\nlines have been discovered under\nthe temple thought to be responsible for the release of hallucinogenic gases. These hydrocarbon gases,\nsuch as ethylene, would have\nbrought about striking neurotoxic\neffects in the famous oracle.\nHowever, new research has\nshown that it is more likely to be\noxygen deprivation from carbon\ndioxide and methane release that\ninduced trance and delirium in\nthe oracle. In the enclosed temple\nchamber, these gases may have resulted in acute oxygen deprivation.\nThe research, published in the current issue of Geology, also suggests\nthat the \u2018sweet smells\u2019 described\naround the temple could have been\nfrom benzene fumes coming from\nlocal springs, although they did not\ndetect the gas.\nThis research provides a rational explanation for the bizarre\nantics of the Pythia, though\nresearch is ongoing to uncover\nthe reasons for the behaviour of\nCourtney Love.\nTruth about\nprophetic\nGreek oracles\nNigel Praities\nPythia inhaled\ntoxic vapours\nand predicted\nthe future\nCourtney Love: Another toxin\nabusing, bullshit spouter\n5\nfelix\nFriday 27 October 2006\nSCIENCE science.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n\n"

    "content": "F\normula 1 has always been\na fast moving sport; drivers and champions come\nand go. Races are won and\nin terms of track records,\nwhoever is vigilente enough to be\nstanding on a podium is anyones\nguess. That is of course with one\nexception that has dominated for\nthe past 15 years. In 1991 a young\nGerman called Michael Schumacher came into the sport. His\ninfamous desire to win at all costs\nand genius in driving a Formula 1\ncar would make him a legend even\nbefore he\u2019d finished his career; a\ncareer which started when a poor\nworker knocked together a small\ngo kart for his 3 year old son in a remote part of West Germany.\nDuring the 1991 season, Eddie\nJordan\u2019s young outfit was running\na French driver called Bertrand\nGachot, who was jailed for spraying\nCS gas at a London taxi driver. Jordan were in trouble, they needed\na driver to replace Gachot at the\nhallowed Spa-Francorchamps circuit in Belgium, a track, alongside\nthe Nurburgring-Nordeschleife,\nconsidered as one of the most fearful places on earth to race a car.\nBacked by his success from the junior racing series leading up to F1\nand bankrolled by Mercedes-Benz,\nSchumacher managed to convince\nJordan that he had raced the track\nmany times, in fact he\u2019d only ever\nbeen around the circuit once, on\na bicycle. It didn\u2019t matter. In the\nqualifying for his first race he mastered the much feared Eau Rouge\ncorner, and parked the Jordan 7th\non the starting grid, outperforming\nhis much more experienced team\nmate and shaking up the F1 estab-lishment. In the subsequent race\nhe failed to finish after the clutch\nblew itself to pieces on the run up\nto the first corner, in the meantime\nFormula 1 had already sat up and\ntaken notice. By the Italian GP two\nweeks later, he\u2019d been snapped up\nby Benetton, thus began the epic\nrise of Michael Schumacher.\nWithin a year he\u2019d wrapped up his\nfirst win, at the very circuit he\u2019d begun his career, and went on to win\nthree more in 1993 in an inferior car\nto the likes of Ayrton Senna, Alain\nProst and Nigel Mansell. His early\ncareer had already marked him\nout as the obvious successor to the\ngreat Ayrton Senna, and Formula\n1 was set for a thrilling battle between two of the most gifted drivers in its history. Then came the\nSan Marino GP at Imola, in 1994, a\nweekend which many in the sport\ncall the darkest weekend in the\nhistory of Formula 1. In qualifying\nfor the race, Roland Ratzenberger\u2019s car hit the wall, instantly killing him. In the race, Schumacher\nthe young pretender was chasing\nthe leading Ayrton Senna. Into the\nfast sweeping Tamburello corner,\nSenna\u2019s car bottomed out, hit the\nwall and he was killed when a suspension wishbone hit him on the\nhead. Schumacher went on to win\nthe championship that year, after\na clash with Damon Hill at the last\nrace of the season. His performance at the Spanish GP went down\nas one of his best: coming home\nsecond despite being limited to 5th\ngear for the majority of the race.\nBenetton\u2019s momentum grew and\nSchumacher\u2019s ability to rally the\nteam behind him saw the teams\naquisition of the 1995 championship\ndouble. As all of this was happening,\na middle of the grid ran team called\nFerrari was watching on. Ferrari,\nalthough a legendary name in motor racing, had been struggling\non track for almost 20 years. After\nthe death of old man Commendatore Enzo Ferrari in 1989, the team\nand company as a whole went into\na freefall dive. Rumour has it that\nFerrari approached Schumacher\u2019s\nmanager, Willi Weber, to sign him\nfor them. He laughed, and jokingly\nsaid \u201cgive us a blank cheque and\nhe will sign for you\u201d. Ferrari was\nnot bluffung and did just that. In\n1996, Schumacher came onto the\ntrack in red overalls. His transfer\nwould help revive the most historic team in motor racing to be-Schumacher: is this the\nend of a racing legend?\nA victory lap to look back on the Formula 1 world champion driver Michael\nSchumacher\u2019s 15 year long run of domination as he heads into retirement\nMost Drivers\u2019 World\nChampionships: 7\nMost Race Wins: 91\nMost Podiums: 154\nMost Pole Positions: 68\nMost Fastest Laps: 76\nMost Championships Won\nConsecutively: 5\nMost Career Championship\nPoints: 1396\nMost Races Won in a\nSeason: 13\nMost Championship Doubles\n(drivers and constructors): 7\nMost races won at 1 track: 8\n(Magny-Cours, France)\nMost Laps completed\nin Lead: 4741\nSchumacher\nrecords\nMichael Schumacher in Red, post-Benetton.

    "content": "come world champions once again.\nSchumacher quickly got to work by\nputting together a team of highly\nskilled and motivated engineers\nand mechanics.\nDespite driving a vastly inferior,\ndog of a car, Schumacher took Ferrari to 3 wins that season. Most\nnotable was his first emotional victory for Ferrari at the Spanish GP\nin Barcelona.

Forty-five seconds in a\nsport where timed measurements\nare calculated to infinitely small\ndenominations of a thousandth of\na second is practically a lifetime in\na F1 race.\nThe next year, in 1997, Schumacher had a season to forget. After being found guilty of attempting to drive Jacques Villeneuve off\nthe track in a bid to win the world\nchampionship, he was stripped of\nall his championship points for that\nseason. This is considered by many\nas a turning point in the sport\u2019s\nperception of Schumacher. He still\nhad his defenders, but now he had\ngarnered a whole new set of critics\nprepped with stoked branders.\nMcLaren-Mercedes rose to\ndominance in the late 1990s and\ntook both the double in 1998 and\nthe driver\u2019s championship in 1999,\nwith Mika Hakkinen at the wheel.\nDespite breaking his legs at Silverstone and missing 7 races in all,\nSchumacher finished the year 3rd\nin the championship.\nThe new millennium brought with\nit a new era of complete and utter\ndominance by Michael Schumacher\nand Ferrari. Together, they snapped\nup both the drivers and constructors championships for 5 years on\nthe trot \u2013 the most dominant era\nby any single driver and any single\nteam ever seen in the history of\nthe sport. Prior record holder Juan\nManuel Fangio had won 5 career\nworld championships in the duration of his career, whereas Schumacher not only blasted through\nthat 50 year standing record in 2002,\nbut set a new one by winning just as\nmany championship consecutively\nin only one team. That same year,\nhe faced controversy for the most\npublic display of team orders ever\nseen in F1. At the Austrian GP\n, his\nteammate Rubens Barrichello was\nin the lead and about to win the race\nwhen he was radioed to slow down\nin the last corner and let Schumacher take the win. The outcry\nin the sport was massive, however\nFerrari got away with a $1m fine.\nHis dominance was so oppressive\nthat in 2002 and 2004 the sport was\nlabelled boring and news companies stopped sending journalists to\nthe races to cover events where in\nall probability Schumacher would\nwin.\nHe relinquished his crown to\nyoung pretender Fernando Alonso\nin 2005 and despite a hard fought\n2006 championship campaign, was\nunable to regain his title. A blown\nengine at the penultimate race effectively sealed the championship\nfor Alonso and Renault.\nSchumacher is labelled by many\nas a \u201ccheat\u201d, but I like to believe\nhe is a genius, albeit inherently\nflawed. Critics emphasize how he\ntried to drive his competitors off\nthe track. With this dire hunger he\neven rammed his brother, Ralf, into\nthe wall at 190mph. But these critics take too much ease in overlooking the unsporting actions of other\ngreats such as Ayrton Senna who\ndrove Alain Prost off the track in\n1990 to win the world championship.\nOthers fault him for being handed\nnumber one status in Ferrari, and\nthat all his teammates were bound\nby contracts to do one thing: Help\nSchumacher win. The fact of the\nmatter is Ferrari is Schumacher\u2019s\nteam. Had it not been for him, they\nwould probably have continued\ntheir performance spiral to the\nback of the grid, and perhaps completely out of the sport all together.\nAs a rule of thumb, the best driver\ngets the number one treatment in\na team, all down the pitlane. The\nsame can be said of pilots. Same\ndifference.\nLooking back at Formula One his-tory, it is easy to see examples of\npeople who have pushed the limits\nof the rules to the maximum to win,\nSchumacher is no different. His\nfinely tuned dogmatic drive to do\nonly one thing has labeled him as\naggressive. His only objective is to\nrace a car to victory and he will do\nanything it takes, even if he oversteps the limits of sportsmanship.\nAs Formula One moves into a new\nera without Michael Schumacher,\nmanyhaveaskedthequestion,\u201cwho\nwill replace Michael Schumacher\u201d?\nAlthough the sport is seeing a huge\nwave of talent filtering through as in\nFernando Alonso, Kimi Raikkonen\nand Felipe Massa, the answer to\nthat question can only be \u201cthere will\nnever be a replacement for Michael\nSchumacher\u201d. There is little doubt\nthat any one of these drivers can\nbreak one or two of Schumacher\u2019s\nrecords, however, it is currently inconceivable that any of them will go\non to beat a man who has rewritten\nthe record books. No other driver\nbesides Schumacher can polarise\nthis sport in such a fashion, or cement a team so cohesively together\nbeneath them, or drive the boots\noff their car so well even when the\nodds are heavily stacked against\nthem. In the end, Senna was the\nfastest ever race driver, over a lap\nhis ability was simply mind bend-ing, but as the complete package,\nthere is no parallel to Schumacher.\nHe has raised the benchmark in\nFormula 1, and has shown that it is\nno longer enough to be just the fastest race driver, one must have the\ncomplete package; speed, team-work, resilience, technical aptitude\nand courage. Despite his cold calculating \u201cwinning machine\u201d image\nin the sport, he is known for being\na charitable person, giving $10m to\nthe Asian Tsunami Fund, the largest single contribution made. He\nworks as an ambassador for many\ncharities and promotes the road\nsafety message of the FIA.\nThere are many that say his last\never Grand Prix and indeed his last\never championship didn\u2019t amount to\nmuch. Regardless, he left the sport\nin the most fitting way that only\nMichael Schumacher could. With\na championship deficit of 25 points\nin Canada, many had ruled him out,\nyet at Monza where he announced\nhis retirement, he was back level\non points with Fernanado Alonso.\nIn the season closing race, having\nhad his left rear tyre punctured, an\nunscheduled pit stop sent him to\n20th position. He cut a 70 second\ntime deficit to under 30 seconds\nand carved up the field to 4th place.\nChasing Jenson Button for a podium place into the final lap of his\ncareer at Sao Paulo, he was over\n5 seconds behind, yet he simply\nrefused to lift his right foot off the\nthrottle pedal, setting the fastest\nlap of the race. For 15 years, there\nhasn\u2019t been a single race where a\nMichael Schumacher win has been\ndiscounted, he has been an omnipresent force. In the end, he went\nout as a true champion and, more\nimportantly, as a true racer.\nTop, Schumacher gleeful over a glorious win that probably earned him a few quid. Center, Formula 1\nstockcar with really expensive tires and choice endorsements.

    "content": "Student wins championship\nThe 2006 Quest adventure race\nseries had been one of mixed emo-tions. The first race of the season\ntook place in April in the New Forest\nwhere the fast flat tracks suited me.\nI was pleased to score more points\nthan anyone else (820 points); how-ever, this was overshadowed by the\nfact I had picked up a time penalty,\nwhich dropped me back to second\nplace despite sharing an equal\nnumber of points with the eventual race winner. Unperturbed, I\nfocussed on the next race, held at\nthe end of May in the Brecon Beacons. I was confident I\u2019d be able to\nmake amends; however, I stupidly\nspent too much time and effort bik-ing. This was a big mistake as the\nheavy rains meant it was quicker to\nrun rather than bike along many of\nthe tracks. Consequently, my score\nsuffered, and I was only able to\ncollect a disappointing 630 points.\nThis was a real low point to my sea-son. I had raced to the limit of my\nphysical capacity, and yet I finished\nsome way off the pace. In the future\nI vowed to take more time to think\nabout decisions. With the bad result\nbehind me, the pressure was off for\nthe third race of the series staged\non the Isle of Purbeck in July. I got\noff to a flying start and managed to\nclear the kayaking stage with less\nthan a minute to spare. Next came\nthe biking, where I visited all but\none of the checkpoints which set me\nup nicely for the running. I was sure\nmy final score of 805pts was good\nenough for top spot. However, as\nthe results were read out I couldn\u2019t\nhide my disappointment at only getting third place. The chap who had\npiped me in the first race of the season had done it again. He came second with an equal number of points\nbut he pushed me into third as he\ncollected them in a faster time.\nSo with just one race left in the\nseason, on September 16, I was still\nlooking for my first elite race win. I\nwas placed third in the series over-all, but with only three out of the\nfour races counting towards the\nchampionship I still had an outside\nchance of stealing the top spot. To\ndo this I\u2019d have to perform better\nthan I ever had before.\nRace day began rather sleepily\nat 5am with a drive to the Wiltshire\nDowns. There I raced against 300\nother competitors, running, biking\nand kayaking to collect as many\npoints as possible in the six hour\ntime limit. Almost immediately after setting off I\u2019d made a couple of\nbad decisions but it wasn\u2019t until I\nfell off my bike into a patch of stinging nettles that it hit home. Undeterred, I battled on, having to miss\nout some checkpoints. I started\nthe kayaking late so there was no\nway I would be able to visit all the\ncontrols, thus I took it easy, conserving energy for the run. By the\ntime I clambered out of my canoe\nmy legs had seized. They loosened\nup once I got moving but the first\nfew minutes were hard work. I had\nto visit all the running checkpoints\nto have any chance of winning the\nseries. It was a big gamble, but I\npaced myself and it paid off. Having\ncleared the run, I was back on my\nbike to pick up a few more points on\nthe way to the finish. As I knew all\ntoo well, if points are shared, then\npositions were decided on time, so I\nkept pushing hard right to the line.\nLater,theresultswereannounced.\nI\u2019d scored 810 points \u2013 enough to\nwin the race and with it the series.\nIt was close. After 24 hours of rac-ing, just five points separated me\nfrom my nearest rival but it didn\u2019t\nmatter.

    "content": "Win The\nOmen!\nThe Departed blasts into box offices\nA well-written script can transform\nits setting from a mere location into\na fully-fledged character in its own\nright, doubly so in the hands of a\ngifted director. Few would argue\nthat Vienna is any less important to\nThe Third Man than Harry Lime.\nMartin Scorcese, however, transcends mere geographical nice-ties; in his works, time becomes a\ncharacter itself. Whilst there has\nbeen a lot made of his decision to\nrepeatedly collaborate with Leonardo DiCaprio, his commitment to\nusing time in each and every one of\nJust in time for Halloween, Felix\nhas three copies of The Omen to be\ngiven away.\nThe Omen (2006) is available to\nbuy and rent on DVD on 23rd October 2006. The Omen 30th Anniversary Edition, digitally remastered\nversions of The Omen sequels and\nThe Omen Pentalogy containing all\n5 films are released to buy on DVD\non the same date. Twentieth Century Fox Home Entertainment.\nIn order to win tell me, how many\nversions of The Omen have been\nmade in film history? And also,\nwho was the director of The Omen\n(1976).\nEmail the answer to\nfilm.felix@imperial.ac.uk now!\nScream! The Grudge returns again\nAlex Casey ventures to the cinema in search of a decent sequel and albino spirits but finds familar territory\nReferencing Scream seems clich\u00e9d\nnowadays when discussing horror films, but there is a sequel rule\nthat secretly worries everyone no\nmatter how much they enjoyed the\noriginal ie: they are generally crap.\nTen years on and Hollywood still\ncashes in with remakes, a low artistic merit, high profit margin culture.\nSo can a film that ticks both boxes\never make an entertaining hit? The\nRing 2, possibly the closest relative\nto The Grudge 2, left audiences di-vided. Unfortunately, The Grudge 2\nwill struggle to do that.\nIt suffers primarily from leaving\nbehind the claustrophobic nature of\nbeing stuck in a foreign country in\na haunted house and trying (as did\nThe Ring sequel) to make a more\nomnipresent fear. It also relies\nheavily on coincidence: in Tokyo\nthere will always be a helpful English speaking stranger (even the\nmother of murderous ghosts from\nan isolated village\u2026) so you never\nbelieve the characters are as bewildered as those of the first film.\nThe opening is reminiscent of the\nprequel so depending on your view\nof this, you may already be making\nyour way back past the ticket coun-ter, but if that\u2019s the case, why did\nyou buy the ticket? The ghosts/de-mons/bluey-pale corpses with the\ncreaky throats are back and the\nrest of the original permeates the\nsequel through flashbacks, strange\ntime-blurring frame splicing and\nthe necessary Sarah Michelle Gellar segment to aid continuity.\nThestorypicksupshortlyafterthe\nfirst one left off, although the heavy\nexposition throughout means you\ncan get the gist of its predecessor\nwithout sitting through it (though I\nrecommend that you should).\nHere the story has three separate\nstrands where we meet fairly two-dimensional characters that fail to\ndevelopment throughout. One involving a schoolgirl daring to enter\nthe original haunted house, one centred on the sister of Gellar\u2019s character finding out the truth about her\nsister\u2019s ordeal, and one concerning\na family in Chicago (Why? Who\nknows\u2026) and their encounter with\nthe Japanese curse. The lact of plot\nconclusion and warped chronology\nleave a sour taste.\nNot caring for the main character or anyone else, means Jennifer\nBeals still has Flashdance on top\nof her resum\u00e9 and Gellar will omit\nit altogether, whilst Amber Tamblyn (yes, of The Sisterhood of the\nTravelling Pants) still hasn\u2019t got a\nbig break. But, the actors do alright\nwith the little they have to work\nwith. While Oscar won\u2019t be calling\nany time soon, they\u2019re watchable\ndespite moments of mandatory\nmelodrama.\nBut the main question: Is it scary?\nWell, no. Shocks are in short supply,\nthe croaky voice grew old in the first\none and the death scenes generally\nflatline. The horror genre is again\nin need of resuscitation as, at this\nrate, Kayako is killing more than\njust hapless American immigrants.\nHell hath no fury like a ghost that can hold a grudge. Takashi Shimizu returns for a fourth outing with\nThe Grudge 2. No, really, a fourth time\nhis films suggests an inseparable\nbond.\nAlthough time plays a slightly\nsmaller role in The Departed than\nit did in Scorcese\u2019s previous feat of\nendurance, The Aviator, it is perhaps a more important one. Whilst\nin the earlier work it displayed the\ndeterioration of the mind with age,\nthe latter is more bleak - time represents death.\nThough the juxtaposition is never\nmade explicit, The Departed is un-arguably about death - for all its\nthemes of loyalty and deception, at\nthe end of the day. And also, it contains the passage of a great deal\nof time both on- and off-screen.\nTwo decades pass in the first ten\nminutes, though Scorcese sensibly\nrefrains from allowing the rest of\nthe film to continue at this pace, or\nits narrative would end in the late\ntwenty-third century. However,\nmost striking is the time experienced by the audience; there can\nbe few to leave the cinema without\nrealising that they are considerably\ncloser to their own death than they\nwere on entering.\nThat it does so without leading to intense boredom cannot\nfail to be noted as a remarkable\nachievement.\nHugh A D\nLeonardo DiCaprio stars alongside Jack Nicholson and Matt Damon in Martin Scorcese\u2019s Infernal Affairs remake, The Departed\nThe dreadful backache from sitting in a cinema seat for three hours\nonly makes itself felt as the credits\nroll, as does the need to nip to the\ngents during a pivotal scene, and\nnaturally every scene is pivotal.\nBarely a second of the screen\ntime is wasted: hammering home\nquite how inappropriate it was for\nthe cinema to stick an extra-long\nhalf hour of adverts and trailers\nat the beginning, knowing full well\nwhat proportion of daylight hours\nwould be taken up by it already.\nIn short, where Scorcese is con-cerned, The Departed really is very\ngood.\n14 felix Friday 27 October 2006\nFILM film.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n\n"

With\nthe sweet taste of Jack Daniel\u2019s\nand Fosters vomit still on my\nbreath (sorry Holly; at least it\nall went down the toilet) the\nMixed XI took to the pitch full of\nconfidence for a victory over a\nbunch of IC players who looked\nas hanging as we felt.\nI\u2019d love to give you a full\nmatch report of our first half\ndominance and silky inter-linked\nplays, but to be honest I can\u2019t\nremember a fucking thing from\nthe whole weekend. Tom scored\nan absolute beauty, taking the\nball from the half-way line and\nthreading through a bemused\ndefence before hammering it\npast the flailing IC keeper. Ade\u2019s\ndebut performance in goal kept\nus in the game in the first half,\nalthough a special (speshul)\nmention should go to Andreas\n(the IC striker) who managed\nto miss more easy opportunities\nthan I\u2019ve had Cornish pasties.\nUnfortunately, somewhere along\nthe way IC scored a couple of\ngoals, apparently, and we lost\n2-1.\nPost-match fineage/celebra-tions were postponed until\nafter training on Monday.

Charlotte\ngot the prestigious Thanks for\nComing award, for doing practically nothing all day, although in\nher defence she did buy us some\nbooze for half-time drinks. To\nher sheer delight she was presented with Old Hooky, red wine,\nBells, Blue Aftershock, and\nmore Lea & Perrins Worcestershire sauce than I\u2019ve ever seen\ngo into one drink before.\nSpecial thanks to Sarah and\nthe IC team for the game; we\nshould do that again some time.\nIf anyone happened to walk past\nthe Union on Tuesday morning,\nand was wondering what the 3-square-metre patch of unidentified purple substance was, I\u2019m\nsure Charlotte would be happy\nto explain (ca305@imperial.\nac.uk).\nHavingfinished2ndinULU&ascup\nsemi-finalists last year, we woke up\non Sunday morning with one thing\nin our mind: how the f**** did I get\nhome last night?\nWith nearly all the tube lines\nclosed to King\u2019s Cross and using Jools\u2019 sense of direction, it\ntook us nearly three hours to get\nto Brookman\u2019s Park. Getting to\nRVC grounds meant taking a long\njourney through a deserted forest,\nwalking past the remainders of cars\nand animals, climbing hills and falling into a couple of holes and nearly\ngetting a pre-season injury. Being\nused to playing with the maximum\nof 7 players in most of the matches last year, having 3 subs meant\nChristmas, 2 months early.\nThe first few strikes by IC in the\nfirst half, led to an early goal by\nspaniard Dehydys-\u201cDD\u201d(our very\nown Joaquin). Getting too carried\naway resulted in a shot by RVC\u2019s\nnumber 12 (aka \u201cthe wall\u201d) which\namazingly missed all the defend-ers. IC\u2019s second goal came from\nHarriet\u2019s corner, finding Lizzie G\noutside the box.\nLG\u2019s amazing Totti-styled shot\narched over and beautifully landed\nin RVC\u2019s goal, leaving everyone\nimpressed, especially the ref, who\ncouldn\u2019t get over it.\nSoon afterwards, RVC was rewarded a free kick from an Oscarwinning dive (even better than IC\nmen\u2019s 7s\u2019 Jack Yip\u2019s) which went\npass the all CivEnged defence and\nslipped in.\nIC managed to take control of the\ngame afterwards. Creating constant attacks starting with Harriet\n& Yoke\u2019s awesome moves & ending\nin DD, LG, Pav & Poppy\u2019s shots.\nThe third goal was a classic. Winning a corner in the last second of\nthe first half was an excellent opportunity for all 22 players to take\npart in it. Harriet\u2019s corner landed\nsomewhere in the crowded penalty\nspot.\nWith IC having more than 10 shots\nand each time, hitting RVC players instead of scoring, it was hard\nto understand what the actual aim\nwas. DD (known as the girl with\nheadband to the opponents\u2019 coach),\nfinally managed to miss RVC players and the half time finished with\nIC leading 3-2.\nHaving both Lizzies (LG & LB) in\nthe pitch in the second half, caused\na disastrous confusion on instruction towards them as G and B were\nmixed up. Again we took control\nearly in the half.\nKate & Emma\u2019s move & Pav\u2019s\nball, which slipped though for Poppy, brought the 4th goal. Linesmans\u2019\nobsession with offside cost us lots\nof good chances. Harriet scored\nthe 5th, in a rather un-balanced\nposition, completing her awesome\ngame that day.\nWhen RVC scored their 3rd, Pav\n(the captain) started worrying. That\nwas when Mona (MLisa) & Poppy,\nwisely, started bombarding IC players with cries of motivation in Spanish & Portuguese. The impact was\ninstant on DD, as she went to score\na fantastic goal, taking advantage\nof goalie\u2019s hasty clearance.\nWinning a penalty was the highlight of the match. Although Pop\u2019s\nshot was denied by the goalkeeper,\nit brought the team closer together\n(thanks for the memories Popps).\nThe game finished with a horrible\ntackle on LG & her being carried\nto the changing rooms, where we\ncould still hear the ref, saying , \u201cDid\nyou see that second goal?\u201d\nBeing awarded the \u201cdouble\u201d dame\nof the match, DD & Harriet will be\nenjoying downing pints on Wednesday night along with their fellow\nteam mates, while trying to figure\nout the difference between Kate &\nKatie and Imperial & Imeprial (es-pecially on flyers).\nMona Haghani\nHockey girls win, get drunk, get lost\nThe RSM Hockey mixed team, and their alcoholic beverage of choice, kangeroo urine..

My life is sorted! Roll\nout the champagne and silk shirts!\u201d,\nthe harsh reality eventually dawns\nthat having a brain full of science\ndoes not a fistful of money make.\nAnd as you soon work out research\npay is pitiful and the city (if you can\nget through the minefield of inter-views) may pay a decent wage but\nit will drain your soul.\nSo how do you turn science into\nhard cash? If you\u2019d turned up to\nJohn Hassard\u2019s presentation at the\nLaunch of IC\u2019s Entrepreneurship\nSocieties event last Tuesday you\nmight have a few ideas. Hassard is\na man with his eye on the ball and\na spring in his step. A man who realised that in order to rake in the\ndosh you need to take off your sci\u2018The Best Science Books Ever\u2019, an\nevent organised by the Royal Institution together with Imperial\u2019s Science Communication group, asked\nthree experts on popular science\nwriting to nominate their candidates for best book.\nThe Guardian\u2019s former science\neditor Tim Radford went for Primo\nLevi\u2019s The Periodic Table, a memoir with its metaphorical roots in\nchemistry. Armand Leroi, biologist\nand author, chose an inspirational\nbook on animal behaviour, Konrad\nLorenz\u2019s King Solomon\u2019s Ring.\nLastly, Sara Abdulla, publisher and\ntheatre buff, praised the skilful writing of Tom Stoppard\u2019s brilliant play\nArcadia.\nLively debate among the panel\nand audience identified other authors and books with strong claims.\nAlthough there could be only one\nAnd the winner is... Primo Levi\nEdward Wawrzynczak\nEmma Turner\nJohn Hassard, reader in physics at Imperial, founded the tidal power\ncompany HydroVenturi Ltd and biotechnology company DeltaDot\nwinner on the night, the discussion\nbrought out the characteristics\ndefining the best books of the science writing genre \u2013 successfully\ncovering a big idea, getting across\nwhat we know of the world, showing\nhow science is done, and, not least,\nachieving high literary quality.\nThe Periodic Table ticked the boxes and won the popular vote. Primo\nLevi deserves a place on everybody\u2019s bookshelf. In the words of\nSaul Bellow: \u201cThis is a book that is\nnecessary to read.\u201d\nto enable us to \u2018See the Molecule\nnot the Label\u2019 (the tag-line on the\nwebsite www.deltadot.com.) The\nentrepreneurial bit of this invention\nis the absence of a pesky intrusion\ninto the imaging process \u2013 the label \u2013 a fluorescent chemical applied\nto the molecule that enables you to\n\u2018see\u2019 it. Basically it gets in the way,\nHassard\u2019s team have used their\ncombined disciplines to remove it\nand sell the new technology.\nThe third and potentially most\nexciting company is HydroVenturi,\na company that puts a spin on tidal\npower, the classic renewable energy\nsource by adding some tweaks that\nmake it just that bit better. Why?\nBecause Hassard thinks big and\nenergy is \u2018the biggest fish\u2019 of them\nall. Where there is a problem, actually a catastrophe looming on the horizon that\nis the whole world\u2019s\ninterest to solve\nthere is money to\nbe made. Basically the bit that\nsticks out of the\nwater is called\nthe \u2018head\u2019 and\nHydroVenturi\u2019s\ngenius is making the head as\nsmall as possi-ble, but not too\nsmall \u2013 as the\nman eloquently\nputs it \u201cDon\u2019t even\nbother getting out\nof bed for more\nthan 10\nmetres of head\u2019\u201d. Sounds good to\nme. This is Hassards advice to budding entrepreneurs \u2013 find a sizeable\nproblem and use your sought after\nscience knowledge to solve it, and\nto do this you\u2019re going to have cross\nover into business territory. It\u2019s a\nscary thought.\nBut on listening, frankly en-thralled, to the man for the duration of his speech there is no disguising the fact that for all his Alan\nSugar-like business sense Hassard\nis a physicist at heart. If for no other\nreason than he calls the symbols on\nthe board his \u2018guys\u2019 (a classic physicist trait), but also because he has\nthe stimulating energy of a man\nwho has the recognisable passion\nfor his useless subject. But in contrast to his crazy haired colleagues\nhis application of the subject\nrenders it not so useless.\nHassard believes that\n\u201cphysicists need to\njustify their existence\u201d, a sentiment\ncertainly not shared\nby everyone. But\nwith a passion and\ndeep love of his\nwork as well as\nmore money than\nyou could ever\nearn in the square\nmile just waiting\nto fall into his wal-let, it\u2019s Hassard and\nthe entrepreneurs\nwho are going to\nhave the last\nlaugh.\n\n"

After checking the CIDs and\nnames of those who signed, only\nhe student newspaper\nof Imperial College\nNo. 1,361 \u2022 Friday \u2022\n27 October 2006 \u2022\nfelixonline.co.uk\nfelix\nfelix\nAndy Sykes\nEditor-in-chief\n617 of the 704 were deemed to be\nvalid, just 3 more than the 614 required by the Union Constitution\n(5% of the Union\u2019s total membership of 12,267). The Exec paper recommended that the question on the\nballot be: \u201cShould Imperial College\nUnion affiliate to the National Union of Students (NUS)?\u201d\nMr Collins\u2019 paper to Council reveals that almost all the Executive\nCommittee declared an interest in\nthe NUS, and therefore could not\nform the Referendum Committee.\nThe only members without an interest were James Millen (SCC Chair),\nJames Yearsley (Media Group\nChair), Shama Rahman (Deputy\nPresident, Graduate Students) and\nJon Matthews (Deputy President,\nFinance & Services). Mr Matthews\nhas been approved by Monday\u2019s\nCouncil meeting to act as Returning Officer for the referendum, as\nJohn Collins (Union President) declared an interest and stood down.\nSome hacks are unhappy with\nthe sabbs being so vocal with their\nopinions on the NUS, and arguing\nthat ICU is already being influenced by the ideas of the NUS. Felix approached each of the sabbs to\nask what their interest in the NUS\nwas. Ben Harris (Deputy President, Education & Welfare), said:\n\u201cEverybody knows I\u2019m pro-NUS,\u201d\nadding that he felt it was okay for\nhim to campaign on behalf on the\npro-NUS cause: \u201cIf I believe something is right for students, then I\u2019ll\ncampaign for it.\u201d There are also unconfirmed rumours that Mr Harris\nwas spotted \u2018lewd dancing\u2019 with the\nNUS President, Gemma Tumelty,\nafter the Presidents\u2019 Dinner during\nthe handover period, though thankfully no photos survive of this event.\nMr Collins (Union President) has\ngone on record numerous times\nas being pro-NUS, and commented to this reporter on his reasons\nfor declaring an interest: \u201cI want\nto be part of the debate.\u201d It is not\nyet clear whether Mr Collins will\ncampaign directly for the pro-NUS\ncause. Eric Lai (Deputy President,\nClubs & Societies) is well known as\na supporter of the anti-NUS cam-paign, and is likely to command the\nbacking of the sports clubs, thanks\nto his role as ACC Chair last year.\nThe leader of the Yes campaign\nis Alex Guite, a friend of Mr Harris,\nand the leader of the No campaign\nis James Fok, the CGCU President,\na position once held by Mr Collins.\nEach of the parties has been given\n\u00a31000 to campaign with, and equal\naccess to student media and other\ncommunication opportunities.\nThe student media are working\ntogether to ensure the facts are\npresented to students in an unbiased way. To this end, Felix is collaborating with the CGCU online\nnewspaper, Live! (live.cgcu.net),\nto present arguments from the\nYes and No campaigns. Live! will\nprovide discussion forums based\naround opinion pieces they receive\nfrom each of the campaigns. The\nUnion\u2019s TV station, stoic TV, will be\nrunning a documentary about the\nNUS, interviewing the sabbs and\nNUS officials.\nFelix urges students to think carefully about the ramifications that\naffiliation may have upon the Union\nbefore voting, and that such a decision should not be made lightly.\nFelix editor-in-chief, Andrew Neil Sykes, pictured practising his\ngurning skills for the upcoming Visage Contortion Festival 2007,\nstunned family and friends when he graduated on Wednesday.\nPassing with a 2:1 grade and being awarded the Evans\u2019 Medal for\noutstanding Chemistry skills, rumours that he slept his way to\nsuccess are completely unfounded. Upon finishing his sabbatical\nposition, a PhD and permanent life of periodic tables and PVC\naprons await. Congratulations from the Felix team!

Not one person\nshowed the slightest sign of disappointment throughout the gig.\nI was given no time to adapt to\nthe level of uncontrollable hysteria the crowd suddenly achieved\nas The Kooks ventured out onto\nthe stage. Before any instruments\nwere picked up I was already suitable crushed by squealing girls\nand blaring men, with beer already\ndripping slowly down my neck. Seaside was the perfect opener, it built\nup the indie-flavoured atmosphere\nwith a fantastic acoustic sound-scape, bringing a smile to even the\nmost sardined person.\nEddie\u2019s Gun burst into life and the\nthunderous cheering by the crowd,\nOldies fail to nourish ears these days\nI\u2019malwaysabitdubiouswhenbands\nput the word \u2018scene\u2019 in their song\nor album titles, it usually means\nthat they\u2019re desperately scenester\nwhilst desperately trying to deny\nit (hello The Cribs). Also, everyone\nknows that Radio 4 are a poor man\u2019s\nLCD Soundsystem. Luckily for Radio 4 something about that fat white\nsingle I possess by the band follows\nthat formula.\nTo be honest if you\u2019re really lazy,\nRadio 4 aren\u2019t the worst place to\nlook for that indie-rock-dance cross-over, but there are a hundred simi-lar, better bands out there and they\ndon\u2019t have a cowbell. Listen to The\nRapture instead, they\u2019re better.\nJames Millen\nrandom projectiles and unintended\nviolence dealt out by the various,\nnumerous inebriated fans present\nwould have looked like a full-scale\nriot from afar. This is something\nyou would not normally associate\nwith The Kooks, undeniably, it was\nall the better for it.\nAfter only five songs I smelt\nstrongly of beer and, interestingly,\ncannabis smoke \u2013 no wonder the\npeople behind me announced that\nthey could actually see the music.\nYou could certainly feel the emotion of the band, though; the music\nflowed down into the crowd as they\ntowered over us all on the stage,\nwhilst everyone present was marvellously illuminated by some spectacular lighting effects.\nShe Moves In Her Own Way\nmade its appearance about halfway\nthrough, and those in the standing\narea were doing anything but. Their\nhands were swinging erratically,\nbeer was sprayed liberally all over\nthe place, and several people disappeared into the pulsating crowd.\nThe encore began after the crowd\ndecided to impersonate a stampeding herd of wild rhinoceroses, and\namazingly people quietened down\nto listen to some new solo work by\nLuke. He wowed even the most ex-citable, drunken fan by once again\ndemonstrating his skills on an\nacoustic.\nThe closer, Pull Me In, proved to\nbe the highlight, with both the band\nand the crowd\u2019s infectious enthusiasm soaring, which climaxed with\nLuke crowd-surfing. He was lucky\nnot to have been sucked down into\nthe pit of screeching girls already\ngripping his trousers legs.\nA special mention must go to their\nas yet unreleased songs \u2013 scattered\nliberally throughout their playlist \u2013\nall of which proved as popular with\nthe crowd as their debut album\nmaterial.\nAfter the gig, as I was plodding\nthrough the sea of plastic cups and\nvarious liquids on my way out, I\ncouldn\u2019t help thinking about what\nthe frontman of Razorlight, Johnny\nBorrell, once said about The Kooks,\nbranding their music 'shit' and the\nlead singer 'boring'. The Kooks\nsoon retorted, dedicating the single\nNa\u00efve to Borrell.\nAfter experiencing such a memorable performance, I can wholeheartedly say that anyone who\nclaims they produce sub-standard\nmusic is truly Na\u00efve.\nRobin Andrews\nThe Kooks\nShepherds Bush Empire\nRadio 4\nPacking Things Up On The Scene\n(EMI)\nHHIII\nsingle reviews\nHundred Reasons\nThe Chance\n(V2)\nHHIII\nHundred Reasons are pretty emo.\nDisagree? Well shuddupayaface\nbecause I once talked to them\nand they freely admitted to having kick-started the British strain\nof emo (Brit-emo? Limyemo? Fish\n\u2018n\u2019 Ch-emo?). They suggested that\nperhaps they were, and I misquote,\n\u2018The Grandfathers of British emo\u2019.\nNothin\u2019 to be proud of boys, and\nalso, up until latest offering The\nChance also factually incorrect.\nThe \u2018Reasons debut Ideas Above\nour Station was imaginative and\nnovel for this country, a prime example of what, for want of a better name, I\u2019d call Brit Rock. Other\nsuch advocates of this were Kinesis\n(the political band of the scene),\nHell is For Heroes (the pop band\nof the scene), Aereogramme (the\nheavy band on the scene), Reuben\n(the teenagers of the scene) and\nBiffy Clyro (the most imaginative\nof the scene). Unfortunately for the\n\u2018Reasons even though they predate\nthese bands, and I think I\u2019m correct\nin saying that all of them have supported HR at some point, they\u2019ve\nnever really had the success and/or\ncritical acclaim that has been enjoyed by the others.\nThe band is technically excellent\nlive, and many of their songs are\ncomplex, but to be honest they\u2019re\nboring. Now new single The Chance\nis about the dullest thing that\u2019s ever\nbeen played on my shiny new MP3\nplayer. The band sound bored; it\u2019s\nquiet, it\u2019s repetitive, no real struc-ture, simplistic drumming, and an\nemo-er than thou \u201cWill you remember me now\u201d outro.\nIn contrast the b-side, the yawn-somely titled Live Fast, Die Ugly is\nover-the-top rock. It\u2019s not a patch\non their previous work; it\u2019s achingly\nobvious Hundred Reasons by num-bers. Oh well guys, you had a good\nrun, and you can probably continue\nhalf selling-out the Astoria for three\nyears if you have good enough touring partners. Proof that fancy websites and nifty graphical design\ncannot save your career.\nJames Millen\nman yelping along to his admittedly\npretty funky songs makes my fists\nitch, so I\u2019ll humour them.\nDance-like drum rhythm. Check.\nSquelchy bassline. Check. Slightly\nyelpy nonsensical lyrics. Check.\nGoes on for about 8 minutes. Check.\nIt has got nice touches, like a piano\nintro, some good use of guitar (a\nlot of this kind of music has awful\nguitar), and a bit of nifty chanting\ntowards the end. You know, it probably took them a day in the studio,\nbut they put in some sort of effort.\nExcept with the b-sides, I hate\nit when the b-sides are just two\nremixes and a radio edit, and every\nThe Kooks in a scene of cabbage-leaf green\nThe Hundred Reasons could do with a riff-sandwich to pick them up\nROBIN\nANDREWS\neviews\nMUSIC music.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n13\nfelix\nFriday 27 October 2006\nR\nMatty Hoban\nMusic Editor\nI\ns anyone else extremely\nbored with the amount of\ncoverage given to any old\npolitician giving their two\ncents on the \u2018veil debate\u2019? I\nhave ceased to have an opinion either way and have been\nreduced to an apolitical mess. A\nworm of opinion if you will. I am\ngoing to take you on a tenuous\njourney related to this, so hold\non.\nSomething I feared as a result\nof all this talk is giving London\nband The Veils publicity. I am\nsomewhat surprised that the\nlead singer of this band has\nchirped in with what he thinks\nwe should do with people\u2019s\nreligious freedom. If you looking for an answer to extremism\nand integration \u2013 not that kind,\nmaths fans \u2013 then don\u2019t look for\nit in between the mundane lyrics\nof said band. Quite frankly, The\nVeils are boring and typical of 3\nmillion guitar bands around at\nthe minute.\nWhich leads me onto the point\nof this rants. Guitar music has\nseen a bit of a renaissance lately,\nwhat with My Chemical Romance becoming chart toppers.\nNow, don\u2019t get me wrong, guitar\nmusic was my first love but I\ncan\u2019t help sighing with disillusionment at every new band\nthat gets labelled with the \u2018up\nand coming\u2019 tag. None of these\nattempt to be challenging or\ninnovative.\nYes, I am a music purist. But\nit isn\u2019t just me who is bored by\nthe current crop of \u2018indie\u2019 bands,\nI\u2019m certain of it. I remember\nwhen bands used to say things\nwith their music but now bands\ncome along with watered down\nmessages of watching girls\ndance and dancing with girls.\nYou should give bands who aren\u2019t\nimmediately accessible but are\ninnovative a chance. Don\u2019t submit to the catchy riff or dumb,\nobvious hook. That\u2019s what the big\nrecord labels \u2013 who want nothing\nbut your money \u2013 want you to do.\nTo round off my socialist\ndiatribe, here are three guitar\nband reviews. Two that have\nbeen around a while and were\nonce exciting, now are struggling\nto achieve. The other review is\nof The Kooks, a young band who\nmake music for consumption,\nnot appreciation. This is all my\nopinion by the way, please feel\nfree to challenge it. It would\nmake a better debate than all\nthis nonsense about veils.\n\n"

The play follows\nthe guilt of the white woman, Jennifer, as she inwardly shoulders the\nblame of the atrocities carried out\nby her dying husband while Beauty,\nher maid, takes advantage of this\nto make a fast buck out of her employer using her alleged healing\npowers.\nA sparsely decorated stage floor\ngreeted members of the audi-ence, with live drumming from Joe\nLegwabe, which set the African\ntheme perfectly. The play begins\nwith a spotlight on a young black\nboy (played by Sarah Niles) being\ninterrogated. The scene changes in\nthe beginning of the play are abrupt\nand at first the lack of direction left\nme a little hesitant as to my enjoyment of the remainder of it.\nHowever, Niles picked up the pace\nwith her witty and often impertinent\nretorts to her employer, Jennifer,\ncarried out with great conviction.\nJennifer, racked with guilt at what\nshe had witnessed her husband do\nto the black boy of the first scene,\nyears before, is hoodwinked into\npaying Beauty a hefty sum to cast\na spell to save her husband\u2019s soul\n- Adshead wanting to illustrate the\nneed for the white people to be absolved of their crimes committed\nthroughout apartheid.\nMoran does well in acting the\ntortured soul, fraught with tension\nafter 42 years in an unhappy mar-riage, yet her erratic South African\naccent let her down. Her neurosis\nas Jennifer is entertaining in the\nway it contrasts with Beauty\u2019s comical interludes. Though one did get\na sense that there was something\nlacking, passion perhaps, in Moran\u2019s overall performance.\nAs Adshead intended, it is Jennifer who is left cheated when realising Beauty has no healing power\nbut is merely trying to make a living in the troubles times in which\nshe lives. Despite thoroughly enjoying the development of the plot\nand theatrical techniques used to\nevoke such tension (Legwabe\u2019s\nhaunting singing and drum beats),\nby the end I felt the play had been a\nbit too heavy going for a Wednesday\nevening after a day of using one\u2019s\nbrain. But before I could go back to\nmy initial impression, once again\nthe play redeemed itself by ending\non an uplifting note.\nBeauty experiences a rare moment of genuine healing power and\nis possessed by the boy Jennifer\nsaw her husband torture, and he in\nturn forgives both Jennifer and her\nhusband. The play ends with the two\ntalking of the flowers they would\nreplant in the garden.

From 10pm to 5am\nthe energy level was sky high in all\nthree rooms with the crowd raving\nto the beats from funky-house to\nfilthy-electro.\nUnlike a typical London club, Egg\nis unpretentious in every single\nway. Situated in a medium-sized\nindustrial-looking building near\nKings Cross, the rooms have all\nthe basic necessities essential to a\ngood clubbing experience. There is\na spacious dancefloor, quick service\nat the bar (the average price for a\nspirit with mixer is \u00a34), comfortable\nsofas to chill in, energetic clubbers\nand most importantly, floor-thump-ing tunes blasted through some\nsick-ass speakers.

    "content": "HSBC pushes student over the edge\nA 20 year old Computer Studies\nstudent from South Wales committed suicide after his bank hounded\nhim to pay off his \u00a31,200 overdraft.\nGeraint Banks-Wilkinson, from\nNant-y-moel, studied at Swansea\nInstitute and was described as an\n\u201caward-winning student\u201d.\nMr. Banks-Wilkinson supported\nhis studies with a part-time job at\nMcDonalds, an overdraft and a\nsmall student loan. In December\n2005 HSBC began to phone Mr.\nBanks-Wilkinson almost every day\npressurising him to pay off his over-draft. His parents later said: \u201cHe\nwas not afraid of a bit of work and\nwas doing his studies as well, but\ncould not do everything. The way\nthey treated him was appalling.\nThey were hounding us when they\ncould not get hold of him.\u201d\nWhilst taking his GCSE exams Mr.\nBanks-Wilkinson had self-harmed\nand had a history of depression. He\nhad also been prescribed anti-de-pression medication.\nThe pressure mounted and climaxed at Christmas when a \u00a31000\nstudent loan was paid into his ac-count, paying off most of his \u00a31,200\noverdraft. HSBC then cancelled\nhis overdraft facility leaving him\nwith no student loan and no access to any money. Distraught, Mr.\nBanks-Wilkinson was driven to the\nBridgend branch of HSBC on 11th\nJanuary by his mother. He returned\nin a state of extreme distress. Mrs.\nBanks-Wilkinson recalled: \u201cHe said\n\u2018They can\u2019t help me\u2019. When he came\nback, basically he sat in the car, put\nhis head in his hands and sobbed.\u201d\nMrs. Banks-Wilkinson tried to\npacify her son over a cup of tea, advised him to try other banks or to\ncontact HSBC by another means.\nHe was appeared to cheer up and\nreturned to Swansea in order to return to work at McDonalds.\nThe next day he went to work as\nusual and socialised with work colleagues after the shift was over.\nHowever, Mr. Banks-Wilkinson was\nfound hanging from the ceiling in\nhis bathroom the following day.\nA final, bitter irony came as HSBC\ntried to phone Mr. Banks-Wilkinson\u2019s father on the day his son died:\n\u201cOn the day he died, they even\ncalled and I told them exactly what\nhad happened. I said: \u2018You have\npestered him for months and now\nyou have driven him to his death. I\nhold you responsible\u2019.\u201d\nPhilip Rogers, the coroner, recorded a verdict of suicide after\na post-mortem exam showed the\ncause of death was by hanging.\nHSBC offered the following statement concerning the tradgedy:\n\u201cHSBC again offers its sincere condolences to the family and friends\nof Geraint Banks-Wilkinson. HSBC\nhas not as yet had an opportunity to\nreview the coroner\u2019s findings and\nas such cannot comment on them\nspecifically. Further, privacy legislation prohibits a bank from discussing the details of its customers\u2019 ac-counts, and we certainly would not\nwant to intrude upon the family\u2019s\ngrief.\u201d A spokesman for the company also said: \u201cAt HSBC we make\nevery possible effort to reach customers the moment we begin to see\nsigns of financial difficulty, not to do\nso would be irresponsible.\u201d\nSince the tragic suicide of Geraint Banks-Wilkinson, a number\nof HSBC customers who have had\nsimilar experiences have come for-ward. One student was reportedly\nleft with \u00a330 to last until the end\nof term because his overdraft was\ncancelled. Jamie Marshall, who\nstudied at Reading University, said:\n\u201cI went over my overdraft limit and\ncleared it by paying in all of my student loan and wages from my job.\nHSBC cancelled my overdraft, leaving me with \u00a330 for the term. For a\nmonth, I ate one meal of beans on\ntoast a day.\u201d Another student, Aaron Robinson claimed to have been\ntargeted by HSBC after he gradu-ated. He said: \u201cRoughly every two\nhours a person would call demanding I pay off my \u00a32000 overdraft in\nfull or face serious repercussions.\nThey then rang my parents from\n6:30am to as late as 10:30pm.\u201d\nAn HSBC spokesman comment-ed: \u201cI don\u2019t see multiple calls as\nbadgering people. It\u2019s trying to get\na message to someone in financial\ndifficulty.\u201d\nWhatever the reasons, whoever is\nto blame, one thing is clear. Despite\nhigh street banks bending over\nbackwards to attract new student\ncustomers, the incentives do not\nmean the banks will offer any sort\nof support, or display any kind of\nunderstanding of a student\u2019s situa-tion. Banking is a hard-nosed business and a successful bank will always defend its interests.\nOn the other hand, many students\nfind it find it difficult to pay the large\ntuition fees and support themselves\nwhilst studying, since they may not\nhave much time to work. This conflict can have disasterous effects\nand is likely to get worse with the\nintroduction of student top up fees,\nputting students under a debt larger obligation.\nThe likely effect is that the pressure created on students from less\naffluent backgrounds may grow\nto much for studying at university\nto be a viable career option. And\nsince graduates earn much more\nthan non-graduates, the rich-poor\ndivide could widen. That point\ncouuld not be more clear than to\nthe friends and family of Geraint\nBanks-Wilkinson.\nGeraint Banks-Wilkinson\nBoris to tackle Uni cheats\nBoris Johnson, the shadow education minister has said that ex-ams, instead of months of course-work, would help prevent students\ncheating.\nCoventry University recently\ncaught 237 students who had broken their rule concerning course-work. Seven have been expelled\nand another twelve cases are being\nlooked at. Nottingham University\nhave disciplined 53 students for the\nsame reason, but only one has been\nexpelled.\nThe main method of cheating is\nby \u2018cutting and pasting\u2019 coursework\nfrom the Internet. Some websites\nare selling essays for up to \u00a31000.\nBaroness Ruth Deech, the student complaints ombudsman, said:\n\u201cEducation is a quest, a voyage of\ndiscovery weighing up a range of\nviews and encouragement of no-tions. The intellectual tradition of\ninquiry is getting lost. If lecturers\ncan imbue students of the notion\nthat they are searching rather than\ncopying, we maybe can go some\nway to tackling plagiarism.\u201d\nThe Daily Mail claims that up to\n20,000 university students were\ncaught cheating last year. Boris\nJohnson also said that the alleged\n10% of students who cheated were\n\u201ca minority driven to extremes\u201d.\nHe also described the website\nUKEssays, which sells essays to\nstudents, as \u201cqueasy-making in its\nefficiency\u201d.\nMeanwhile, Wes Streeting, the education vice-president for the NUS\nclaimed the high level of students\nworking part-time was putting\nthem under pressure. He also attacked some universities for having \u201cadopted a heavy hand and\u2026\nthrowing students off courses.\u201d\nAnother popular way for cheaters is to use technology. Typically a\nstudent would photograph a question and MMS the picture to a colleague outside the exam hall, who\nthen sends back the answer. The\nproblem has got so bad that one\nGovernment expert is calling for\nexam rooms to be \u2018shielded\u2019 from\nmobile phone signals using a \u2018Faraday cage\u2019. The device would act\nsimilarly to the way elevators act in\nblocking mobile phone signals.\nPlagiarisers should be wary; Universities UK say that 80% of institutions are now using the electronic\nsoftware \u2018Turnitin\u2019 to catch the\ncheats.\nBoris Johnson moments before tackling German No. 6 Maurizio\nGaudino; if that\u2019s anything to go by then cheaters should watch out\nNo C in the K&C!\nThe Congestion Charge is to be\nrolled out over a large section of\nKensington and Chelsea. The plans\nhave been contested in the area,\nbut the efforts of campaigners appears to have failed. The existing\nzone, which borders Park Lane,\nwill be swept out to the Earl\u2019s Court\nRoad one-way system.\nThe plans have come under intense\ncriticism since the RAC revealed\nthat the most congested roads lay\nto the north, south and east of the\ncentre, rather than to the west.\nThis has led many to question Ken\nLivingstone\u2019s motives. Some believe he is trying to raise income by\neffectively introducing a tax on the\nresidents that live in West London.\nEdmund King, executive director of the RAC Foundation, said:\n\u201cThere is no possible logic for singling out west London for this proposed extension. There are many\nother areas that are far more con-gested. Many key routes that cross\nthe proposed new charging zone\nhave very little congestion at all. Of\ncourse King\u2019s Road gets busy but\nthat is a sign of a vibrant shopping\nand entertainment culture. Experience tends to suggest this latest\nscheme is all about revenue rais-ing, not combating congestion.\u201d Jo\nValentine of London First said businesses were frustrated at the Mayor\u2019s \u201cunwillingness to... address\nproblems with congestion hotspots,\nnone of which are in the proposed\nextension.\u201d\nA document released by the\nRoyal Borough of Kensington and\nChelsea points out that not all the\nresidents of the borough are afflu-ent; some areas in the borough are\nthe most deprived in England. The\nareas of St. Charles and Golbourne\nhave about 23,000 residents, 60% of\nwhom live in social housing. Under\nthe proposed plans, these residents\nwould not qualify for the reduced\ntariff, but would not be able to effectively use their car without paying\nin full.\nHYDE

    "content": "I awake at 1500m, in a hut on the\nslope of mountain Migovec in Slovenia, to the sight of a cup of coffee being waved in my general direction.\nThe caving club has been exploring\nthe deep caves of this mountain in\nconjunction with the local club for\nover a decade. The main cave system is over eleven kilometres long,\nand nearly a thousand metres deep.\nOur hope for today was to enter a\nmore recently discovered cave \u2013\n\u2018Primadona\u2019, and explore in the direction of this main system \u2013 barely\na hundred metres away. Combined,\nthese caves would be the longest\ncave in Slovenia that can be explored without diving equipment.\nSetting off for the peak high above\nwe are accompanied along the\nsteep path by the roar of a river\nin the deep valley to our side, the\nstark peaks of the next mountain\nrange jutting purposefully from the\nwhite cloud that rolled below our\nfeet. At the cave entrance we check\nand stow all our gear carefully \u2013 one\nforgotten item would spell a premature and disappointing end to the\ntrip.\nThe entrance is an enormous\nslope of permanent snow, a fast toboggan ride in a plastic oversuit! A\nquick crawl and a wander along a\npassageway, to reach the first rope.\nDown we shoot, zipping through\nthe inky blackness. Kept company\nby the click of the karabiners onto\nrope, and the clunk of the boulders\nbeneath the feet, forever chasing\nthe headlight in front, the calls of\n\u2018Rope Free!\u2019 and \u2018OK!\u2019 merging into\nsoporific mumbles over the echo.\nToday I am in luck \u2013 the Slovenian at\nthe front of our advance party sings\nbass in a choir. Soon the chambers\nare resounding to his sonorous renditions \u2013 Slovenian folk songs interspersed with Leonard Cohen.\nAbseiling down through a chimney between the rock, the walls\nsuddenly disappear. Looking down\nfar below, I can see pinpricks of\nlight \u2013 the headlamps of the rest\nof the party waiting for me. I reach\na reattachment point in the rope,\nwhere I need to take my abseil\ndevice off one section of rope and\nreattach it beyond the rock anchor.\nBefore I joined the caving club,\nthe very idea of doing such a manoeuvre would have filled me with\ndread. The drop is not just enough\nto guarantee a certain death, but\nwould allow plenty of time for contemplation before hitting the rock.\nHowever, I now know that I am safe\nin my harness and am perfectly at\nease, my actions totally automatic\nas I attach multiple safety cords,\ntransfer my weight over and tested\nmy descending device before taking out the last safety.\nFree once more, with absolutely\nno effort I gently drift down. AbExploring the deep\ncaves of Slovenia\nJarvist Frost seiling down into this bell-jar I am\nleft dangling in free space; the thin\nwhite line of the rope disappearing beyond my light\u2019s illumination\nabove. The knit of the rope sheath\nstarted me gently spinning \u2013 I don\u2019t\neven have to turn my head to watch\nthe chamber go by, to see the waterfall across the way develop from\na drippy purr into an almighty roar.\nAn energetic scramble up a slope\nof boulders got me to my compan-ions, sitting on insulating coils of\nrope in a side chamber away from\nthe damp and the draft of the falling\nwater. Cravings for chocolate and\nnicotine were indulged by the various cavers, ice-cold drinking water\ncollected from a nearby rock pool.\nHow deep were we now? Still very\nshallow \u2013 not much more than two\nhundred metres. So \u2013 only deeper\nthan Canary Wharf is high!\nWe then undulate along, scrambling over enormous house-sized\nchunks of limestone, ducking\nthrough rock archways and stomping along tube-tunnel-sized pas-sageways. At the limit of explora-tion, we unpack and prepare to\nclimb. Hours of work are spent\ngaining a precious ten metres of\nheight through the roof of the corri-dor. Finally up, we had entered the\nunknown.\nA little chamber with a clamber up\ninto a crawlspace. No one has ever\nseen this passage, and we have no\nidea where it goes. This bit of cave\nwas very old indeed, having formed\nwhen this part of the mountain was\nbelow the water table, before the\nkilometre-deep valleys formed on\neither side. As the last of the water\ndrained out, it left behind amazing\nformations in the rock and the mud,\nsome of which inevitably were illu-minated, admired and then crushed\nunderfoot.\nSome rather acrobatic manoeuvres later, and the passage starts\ngetting much bigger. Drawn on by\nthe sound of a waterfall, we clamber down increasingly large climbs\nonto an enormous rock shelf. The\nmain drop was too far for the short\nrope that we have, though looking\ncarefully over the edge, one can see\na little underground river running\npast far below. Placing rock-an-chors on the very end of the ledge\nand bouncing sideways as we abseil\ndown, one could reach a false floor\njust within the length of our rope.\nSafely down, we walk around the\ncorner to be confronted with a clear\nsign that someone had been here\nbefore \u2013 a neat cairn of rocks placed\non a boulder in the middle of the\npassageway, marking the location of\na survey station. But in which cave\nare we now? We had certainly travelled a sufficient distance to reach\nthe main system, but the path had\nso many twists that we have no way\nof telling our overall direction. Exciting stuff indeed!\nWe split up and scramble around,\nlooking for another station \u2013 hopefully one with a little note on waterproof paper stating which part\nof the survey it was, and therefore\nwhich cave. This part of the cave\nwas an absolute rabbit warren, with\nextinct waterfalls and passageways criss-crossing and spiralling\naround each other. Like some Escher drawing, you can step across\na chasm and look down to see another team member crawling along\nsideways below you, while another\ncaver traversed along high above.\nTime was passing, and it was\nmany hours of effort to reach the\nsurface. Half the team started surveying the way back, slowly taking\npoint-to-point compass, clinometer\nand distance measurements for\nfeeding into a computer once back\nin the nearby town. The rest of us\ncontinue to explore. Climbing down\nwith the other English ICCC caver,\nwe found a route which doubles\nback under the way that we have\ncome, shuffling along an increasingly wide gorge. Looking down is\nterrifying indeed \u2013 the roaring river\nbeing very far below, but the climbing was easy, along wide mantelpieces of limestone. Back in a cor-ridor-like passage we explore with\ndawning realisation \u2013 to be suddenly confronted with the sight of\nour original rope disappearing into\nthe ceiling! This bit of cave simply\nreconnects to itself in a loop.\nSo we had failed to make the big\nbreakthrough, on that trip at least.\nBut no one has ever been down\nto that underground river \u2013 all it\nrequires is more rope and more\ntime.

    "content": "Letter\nfrom an\nex-editor\nWho will influence whom?\nA\ns postgraduates, we\u2019ve\nbeen around Imperial\nfor quite a while \u2013 5 or\n6 years in fact. We remember the last NUS\ndebate, which was full-bodied and\nlively, with a sabbatical leading the\nYes campaign and an ex-sabb leading the No campaign. The result\nwas an overwhelming 72% in favour\nof remaining outside the NUS.\nThis time around things have\nchanged. The key argument is that\nonce we pull out of the University of\nLondon we\u2019ll no longer have a union bigger than us \u2013 University of\nLondon Union in this case \u2013 to fight\nour corner at a higher level. Many\npoor misguided souls feel we will\nhave no voice without joining the\nNUS, as evidenced by the publicity\nstunt during freshers week (see the\nphoto on the article). They need to\ntake a serious look at what\u2019s going\non around them.\nThe key question to ask, is \u201cwould\nwe influence the NUS, or be influenced by them?\u201d The answer is\nplain to see, if you look at the attitude of certain sabbaticals. The ICU\nwebsite contains an announcement\nby Deputy President (Education\n& Welfare) Ben Harris of the NUS\nanti-fees march on Sunday.\nWhilst the march is a worthwhile\nventure, ICU appears to be losing\nan independent voice already. Imperial\u2019s delegation will join the NUS\nLondon region, rather than working\nwith non-NUS affiliated institutions\nsuch as Southampton.\nThe NUS introduces the campaign on its website as follows:\n\u201cTop-up fees of up to \u00a33,000 are\nhere. Student debt is at its highest\nand applications to university decreased by nearly 4% this year. This\nIs it in the interests of Imperial students to pay tens of thousands of pounds to the\nNUS when our interests often confict with some of those of the current members?\n\u201cIf we join, our\nvoice will get\ndrowned out in\nan organisation\nfull of career\npoliticians and\nthose student\nactivists more\nconcerned with\nforeign policy\nthan student\nissues\u201d\n8 felix Friday 27 October 2006\nomment&\nOpinion\nC\nDear Andy,\nFirstly, congratulations on hitting the ground running as the\nnew \u2018Editor-in-Chief\u2019 of Felix.\nHowever, I couldn\u2019t help but feel\na little upset with some of your\ncoverage these first few weeks.\nI\u2019m not entirely sure why you\nfeel you have had to belittle my\neditorship of Felix on so many\noccasions \u2013 in your (otherwise\nexcellent) handbook, in your first\neditorial of the year and in last\nweek\u2019s edition.\nYou may not agree with\nsome of the things we did last\nyear, but winning four Guardian Student Media Nominations is quite a success story.\n\u201cIn what may surprise some\nof those he antagonized in the\nUnion and College, the previous\neditor, Rupert Neate, has been\nnominated twice\u201d, is sniping and\ncounterproductive. To write such\na disparaging news story and\nrather pettily choosing a weird\npicture of me (face painted as a\nTiger) seems a little\u2026 bitter?\nTelling the readers of your first\neditorial you had \u201cinherited a\nFelix thoroughly disliked by both\nstaff and students\u201d is just untrue\n(sorry if it\u2019s not a direct quote,\nbut you haven\u2019t updated the website at all despite promising to do\nso in your election campaign).\nAt the end of the day, you\u2019re\nnot just insulting me by belittling\nFelix\u2019s success, but all those who\nworked so hard to make the paper what it was last year \u2013 many\nof whom still work on your staff.\nIt\u2019s a shame you can\u2019t feel\nproud of the fact that Felix has\nbeen nominated four times. Perhaps you should stop attacking\nmy editorship and concentrate\non what really matters to readers \u2013 doing a good job with yours.\nYours,\nRupert Neate\nFelix Editor 2005-2006\nDear Rupert,\nFirstly, thanks for your compliments on my handbook.\nI feel the opinions expressed in\nmy editorial adequately backed\nup the feelings of the general\npopulation of the College. As\nfor the editorial team, well, they\nseem happy with my leadership;\nthe free pizza for those working\nwith me late at night might have\nhelped. That tiger photo is apparently one of your favourites; you\nused it for your columns in the\npast. Perhaps you\u2019ve forgotten?\nIf you take a look at the website\nnow, you\u2019ll see a placeholder. The\nnew site will launch next term.\nGood luck with your journalism\ncourse; I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll fit right in.\nYours,\nAndy Sykes\nAshley Brown\nOliver Pell\nsituation is only set to get worse.\u201d\nBen Harris provides the following\ntake on the campaign on the union\nwebsite, \u201cTop-up fees of \u00a33000 have\narrived on campus. Student debt\nstands at record levels and looks\nset to reach up to \u00a344,000. And it\u2019s\nabout to get worse.\u201d Much of the\ntext appears to come directly from\nthe NUS, with a small degree of\nparaphrasing. The impression is\nof a union whose fees policy is being driven by the NUS campaign,\nrather than an independent, freely\ndiscussed ICU policy.\nIf our policies are already influenced by the NUS, what would\nhappen when we finally joined?\nICU should be defending its own\nstudents, not students all across\nthe country. Our lab-based courses require an increase in funding\nfrom somewhere, presumably from\ncheaper non-lab courses. A central national body (the NUS) will\nbe obliged to defend funding for all\ncourses, even though it would not\nbe best for our current and future\nstudents.\nAnother question to ask is what\ndegree of representation would we\nget from a group so fundamentally\ndifferent from us in their views?\nWhile the NUS national conference\ndiscusses issues such as foreign af-fairs, Imperial tries to keep those\nout of union committees, preferring\nto focus on student issues instead.\nWe would be one voice among thou-sands, no more powerful than unions such as Manchester \u2013 a union\nwhich has not spoken to its Vice\nChancellor for several years, because of his stance on fees.\nIf we join, our own voice will get\ndrowned out in an organisation full\nof career politicians and those student activists more concerned with\nforeign policy than student issues.\nWe have no voice that can be heard.\nWhat\u2019s worse, we might even end\nup with policies at odds with our\nneeds, due to policies drifting downwards from the NUS. Former NUS\npresidents \u2013 Charles Clarke for example \u2013 actively pushed for top-up\nfees despite the NUS opposition.\nIf we do not join, we have only our\nown voice. We will need to shout\nloudly to be heard, but we cannot\nbe suppressed by the views of other\nunions who\u2019s needs our different\nfrom ours. We are the 3rd-best university in the country and 9th-best\nin the world. We have the 4th-best\nmedical school in the world, after\nOxford, Cambridge and Harvard.\nWe have a loud voice if we want\none \u2013 look at the fuss over the dress\ncode. That debacle resulted in the\nGuardian linking to our news serv-er, along with coverage on London\nTonight, BBC News Online, India\nTimes, The Daily Mail and even The\nRegister. Finally, there was the top-up fees debate from 2002 in which\nthe silent protest was covered by\nthe press.\nLet\u2019s not forget that the NUS lost\nthelasttop-upfeecampaignandhas\nhad very few successes in England\nwhile the Labour government has\nbeen in power. A lot of NUS officers\nwant to become Labour MPs (and\noften succeed), which may have\nsomething to do with it. Our fluffy\npro-NUS sabbs \u2013 ICU President\nJohn Collins and DPEW Ben Harris \u2013 are also both supporters of the\nLabour party, along with the leader\nof the \u2018Yes\u2019 campaign, Alex Guite.\nWhen voting, think very carefully\nabout whose welfare these people\nare looking out for.\nILLUSTRATION:\nMATTY\nHOBAN\n\n"

    "content": "This week\u2019s business news\n\u25a0 Shares in the Industrial and\nCommercial Bank of China will\nbegin trading this Friday in what\nis likely to be the world\u2019s largest\never IPO. The flotation of ICBC,\nChina\u2019s biggest lender, generated huge interest last week, with\norders for the 5% portion of the\nshares allocated to retail investors 49 times over subscribed in\nShanghai. Such interest is likely\nto see the shares priced at the\ntop of the proposed range of\n$0.33\u2013$0.39.\nWith the IPO split between the\nHong Kong and Shanghai mar-kets, ICBC stands to raise up to\n$16bn in Hong Kong and $5.8bn\non the mainland, trumping the\n$18.4bn float of NTT DoCoMo\nin 1998. These figures assume\ngreenshoes (the ability to issue more shares than initially\nplanned in case of heavy demand)\nwill be exercised. The success of\nthe offering was due in part to\ninvestors\u2019 desire to access the\nbooming Chinese economy, with\nrisk reduced due to the Chinese\ngovernment\u2019s backing of ICBC.\nThe company has also done much\nrecently to reduce a soaring non-performing loan ratio with a restructuring that has made the\nbank competitive.\nEurope\u2019s impending pension crisis\nOld people are getting older, with\nthe average person living to be 76,\nfive years longer than was in the\n1960s. The reasons: people have\nbetter lifestyles, better healthcare\nand new medicines. Worryingly,\nwhilst the old are multiplying, the\nyoung are not. This is amplified by\nthe baby boomers, born after the\nSecond World War, who are now\nreaching retirement age. Exacerbated by the low birth-rate of 1.47\nchildren per woman, European\npopulations are getting smaller. All\nthis combined is changing the population distribution from a pyramid\nto a more top-heavy shape. By the\nyear 2050, the year I am due to start\nreceiving my state pension, there\nwill only be 2 adults per person over\nthe age of 65.\nThe retirement age in the UK\nis currently 65 for men, and 60 for\nwomen. However this is going to\nstart to rise with the retirement age\nfor women reaching 65 by the year\n2020. In most EU countries, people\ndepend on state pensions when\nthey retire. With the state pension\nin the UK being under \u00a3100 a week,\nit makes for quite a meagre living.\nThe government is encouraging\npeople to put money in to their own\npension schemes.\nIt is not just state pensions which\nare in trouble. Last month, David Norgrove, from the Pensions\nRegulator, expressed his concerns\nabout companies underestimating the length of time people will\nbe withdrawing from their pension\nschemes. With each year life expectancy increases, there is in an\nincrease of 4% to pension scheme\nliabilities. This is becoming a very\nreal and very expensive problem\nfor companies and could spell disaster to any who underestimate it.\nAs it is linked to the stock market,\nif the economy was to slow down\ncompanies may not be able to provide the pensions they said they\nwould. Their mistakes could end up\ncosting us in higher rates or lower\npay out rates once we have retired.\nThe elderly want to help combat\nthe pension crisis. Some have been\nPaul Estruch\nBusiness Correspondent\nforced to retire, whilst others would\nenjoy a part time job for a little extra money and to keep them mentally sharp.\nSome employers frown upon hir-ingtheseveryexperiencedworkers.\nThey can be seen as having a very\nshort shelf life and some bosses do\nnot like the idea of having someone\nmore experienced and possibly\nmore qualified working below them.\nMany of the older generations are\nreturning to work, though. There\nhas been a big increase in part time\nwork for the elderly in places such\nas supermarkets who utilise the\nolder generations experience and\nexcellent people skills.\n\u25a0 Markets have remained buoyant\ndespite mounting evidence that the\nUS economy is heading for a \u201chard\nlanding\u201d. It is increasingly likely\nthat the Federal Reserve will keep\nrates at 5.25%, rather than making\nthe economy-boosting cut that had\nbeen hoped for. Despite this, falling\noil prices have seen the FTSE 100\nretain ground and the Dow Jones\nIndustrial Average break 12,000 for\nthe first time.\n\u25a0 Corus, the Anglo-Dutch steel-maker, confirmed it accepted a\n\u00a35.1bn takeover bid from India\u2019s\nTata Steel, in a deal that would create the world\u2019s sixth-largest steel\nproducer. Corus and Tata Steel have\nagreed a cash offer, valuing Corus\nat 455p per share, which will be put\nto shareholders over the coming\nmonths. The Tata-Corus deal would\nbe India\u2019s largest foreign takeover,\nreinstating Asia\u2019s current strength\nin the steel industry.\nThe deal, which includes an equity value of \u00a34.1bn and around \u00a31bn\nin debt, was not received well by\nStandard Life, one of Corus\u2019 largest shareholders. The investment\ncompany, who own a 7.9 per cent\nstake, says the deal undervalues\nCorus, and has not yet commented\non whether or not they will accept\nTata\u2019s offer. The deal maintains the\ntrend of rapid consolidation within\nthe steel sector, the most recently\npublicised being the \u00a318.1bn takeover of Arcelor by Mittal Steel (an-other Indian steel maker) in June\nthis year.\n\u25a0 Toshiba, the Japanese industrial\ngiant, is to sue Sony for damages\nto its brand image after the recall\nof about 830,000 of its laptops that\ncontain Sony\u2019s allegedly dangerous\nlithium-ion batteries.\nThe batteries, which have reportedly overheated and burst into\nflame, have been installed in laptops\nof several different manufacturers,\nleading to a global recall of about\n8 million Sony batteries, with US\nmarket leaders Dell and Apple recalling 6 million batteries between\nthem. Sony last week announced a\nhuge revision to its operating profits forecast for the full year.\nThe battery recall is expected to\ncost Sony up to \u00a3180 million, based\nonly on the cost of replacing the\nfaulty batteries, and not including\nthe potentially huge compensation\ncosts if legal action is carried out\nagainst them. Sony reported that\noperating profits would be 62 per\ncent below its previous forecast, at\nY50bn rather than Y130bn, despite\nan unchanged revenue forecast of\nY8,230bn. The situation has been\nexacerbated by recent problems\nin its games division. Sony\u2019s huge\ninvestment in its much hyped PlayStation 3 has yet to be realised as a\nresult of launch delays and a reduction in price and initial shipments.\n\u25a0 David Cameron and Gordon\nBrown have sought to win the support of the City in their pledges for\nthe premiership. In a meeting with\nleading City figures Mr Brown proposed a significant review of the tax\nsystem aimed at reducing regulation by \u201cat least 25 per cent\u201d. Mr\nCameron\u2019s Conservative Party published a review that also recognised\nthe need for simplification of taxes\nand further recommended a cut in\ncorporation tax, from 30 to 25 per\ncent, and the abolition of stamp\nduty on share transactions. Currently at a rate of 0.5 per cent,\nthere have been increasing calls\nfrom the financial sector to scrap\nthis tax, an issue that Mr Brown\nhas as yet failed to address.\nThese proposed measures aim to\nkeep the City an attractive place\nto do business. By changing the\ntax regime, London will hope to\nremain competitive with global\nfinancial centres.\n7\nfelix\nFriday 27 October 2006\nBUSINESS business.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nThe government has recognised\nthis want of pensioners and as of the\n1st of October, new age discrimination laws have come in to affect. It is\nnow illegal to discriminate against\nsomeone because of their age if\nthey are under 65 and people over\n65 need to be given 6 months notice\nwhen an employer wants them to\nretire. This, in theory, should help\nto get the elderly out of retirement,\nnot only meaning they do not need\nthe support of the government and\nliving a better life, but paying taxes\nto help support others.\nThe government recognises what\na big problem the pension crisis\ncould become and has set out a list\nof proposals in a white paper earlier this year, based on the recommendations of Lord Turner. It has\nbeen set out that the retirement\nage is going to be raised gradually\nfrom the year 2024, so that by 2048\nthe minimum age for withdrawing\na state pension is 68. The government also wants to introduce a National Pension Scheme in the year\n2012. 4% of a person\u2019s salary will be\npaid in to the scheme, with the employer paying an additional 3% and\nthe government 1% into it. The government is hoping that the National\nPension Scheme will counteract\nany fall in state pensions caused\nby the growing size of the older\ngenerations.\nThere are some people out there\nthat believe there is, and will be, no\npension crisis. It is thought amongst\nsome that the change in ratio of\nyoung to old will be offset by the\nincrease of productivity. Further to\nthis, immigration is increasing and\nwill continue to increase, with the\nacceptance of Bulgaria and Romania in to the EU. These immigrants\nprovide needed relief to the work\nforce, helping to bolster the working force, supporting the elderly.\nUndoubtedly we will have to continue working to an older age than\nour parents. If we want a reasonable standard of living, so we can\nenjoy our twighlight years, we have\nto expect to either pay higher taxes\nor make contributions into a pension scheme almost as soon as we\ngraduate from our courses, and\nmake it a priority.\nBy 2050, the rising proportion of elderly people means that there will be only two adults per pensioner\nThe Commercial Bank of China is set to be the world\u2019s largest IPO\nCraig Lukins\nEmily Tam\nBusiness Correspondents\nThe current retirement ages of 60 and 65, for men and women respectively, are set to rise dramatically\n\n"
