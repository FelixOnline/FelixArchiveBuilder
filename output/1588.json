    "content": "10 THE STUDENT PAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON FELIX\n14.11.2014\nComment Comment Editor Tessa Davey\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nThe darker side to student journalism\nArecent article in The Guardian\nexplored the world of student\njournalism, and the often\nstrained relationship between student\njournalists and their Universities and\nStudent Unions. One such story took\nplace at Plymouth University last\nyear, where the Editor faced thinly\nveiled threats from their Union, who\nwould put her degree at risk if she\ncovered a story about cuts to student\namenities. When trying to run a\nstory about how University staff had\nan all expenses paid trip to Miami,\nshe was told by the University\u2019s\ncommunications team that they\nwould rather she didn\u2019t print stories\nwhich portray the University in a bad\nlight, adding that if she had gotten on\nbetter with the University, perhaps\nshe could also have gone to Miami.\nIt was a similar case at Durham\nUniversity, when a story about a\ncontroversial appointment of their\nnew Master of University College\ncaught the attention of the Union\nand University. Their Editor was also\nthreatened with \u201cserious disciplinary\nmeasures\u201d and the University\ndemanded to proof read each issue\nbefore publication.\nThe Ripple at Leicester was delayed\ngoing to print after their Union\nthreatened to close the paper if a\nfront page investigation into the\nUnion\u2019s engagement with students\nwas not removed from the paper.\nIt\u2019s only natural that institutions\nwant to protect their reputation\nand image, but these stories show\na worrying trend towards the idea\nthat they can bend student media\nand student journalists to prevent\nthe publication of critical pieces:\neffectively preventing them from\nholding their University and Union\nto account. As Universities have\ngrown and expanded their operations,\nthey look further afield for sources of\nfunding. In parallel, rises in student\nfees means they face increased\ncompetition from rival institutions\nto attract students. The number of\nTV and tube adverts we see now for\nundergraduate degrees epitomises\nthis change.\nThese changes have pushed\nUniversities to act more like large\ncorporations than they have ever\ndone before. Image and corporate\ncommunications move up on the\nagenda. I don\u2019t blame them for this\n\u2013 it makes a lot of sense. Image is\nimportant. It is, however, unrealistic\nto expect student newspapers and\njournalists to not investigate issues\nthat affect them and their institution,\nor are of interest to the University\ncommunity. In the rest of the world,\nspokespeople for big corporations\nwill try and quell stories, but have no\nway of controlling what is reported.\nI fail to see why this should be any\ndifferent within a University.\nWe must stay on the right side\nof defamation law (slander and\nlibel), but this is the case with every\npublication. With the right training\nand guidance, this is achievable.\nI\u2019m proud that we can print without\nhaving our paper scrutinised by an\nOfficer of Imperial College Union,\nor Imperial College London. The\nday when we have to submit every\npage for review will be a sad day for\nquality journalism and free press. As\nProfessor Michael Bromley, interim\nHead of Journalism at City University\nsaid: \u201cThis all seems a bit Stalinist to\nme\u201d.\nFelix is proud to be independent from the Union and College.

These were:\n- We misprinted Belly Dancing\nsociety\u2019s email. Their correct\naddress is:\nbellydancing@imperial.ac.uk\nThis week we\u2019re reporting on\nImperial College Union\u2019s\npenalties against the various\nrugby teams, the confusion over the\nSilwood redevelopment plans and\nthe fallout from this week\u2019s Union\nCouncil meeting.\nThe Council meeting ran on for\nan impressive three hours, and was\ndivided into two parts; the main bulk\nwas discussing the papers submitted\nby the Sabbatical officers and some\nof the Council members, whilst the\nsecond part was a discussion on how\nto combat anti-social behaviour in\nsocieties.\nDespite this discussion being\ninsightful, this topic as a whole needs\nto move beyond the walls of Council,\nand beyond the same group of people\nwho, despite, in theory representing\nthe majority of the student body, are\nvery much a select minority of the\nstudent population as a whole.\nThe Higher Education Funding\npolicy is attracting a lot more\nattention than this discussion.\nAlthough Tom Wheeler has claimed\nthat \u201cyob culture\u201d is something he\nwants to tackle, nothing is being said\nabout how to further investigate\ndrinking culture in clubs and the\nnegative effects this may have.\nA General Meeting has been called\nto finalise the Higher Education\nFunding policy, which requires 200\nstudents to attend and vote on the\npolicy before it is passed. However,\nwhy is anti-social behaviour being\nseemingly relegated whilst so many\npeople seem to have to be consulted\nover a policy that, in reality, may\nactually have little effect?\nThe policy, once decided upon, will\nprovide a foundation upon which\nthe Union will lean when it comes\nto \u2018lobbying\u2019 parliament. What\nthis lobbying entails has yet to be\nmentioned.\nWhether parliament will even\nlisten is a completely separate\nstory. Yet hours of discussion is\nbeing dedicated to this topic, whilst\naddressing issues that are affecting\nthe students currently at Imperial\nis being pigeonholed into informal\ndiscussions that aren\u2019t widely\npublicised.\nBack over at College, the decision\nto change bursaries also seemed to\nhave little discussion that involved\nstudents. With Tom given such a\nsmall window to investigate what\nstudents may feel about the proposed\nchanges, and the deadlines for the\nwindow set by the print deadline\nof next year\u2019s prospectus no less,\nit seems again that topics that\nshould be openly challenged and\ndebated are being hastily pushed\nthrough. Meanwhile, others that\nare being allocated hours and hours\nof debate are likely to be rather\ninconsequential.\nThis brings us nicely to the Silwood\nconfusion. We spoke to a number of\npeople, all passionate about the work\nthat happens at Silwood, and yet all\nuncertain as to what to think of the\nplans.\nLuckily, the petition is facilitating\ndebate that could have an impact\nif no formal decisions have been\nmade yet, and hopefully the\nredevelopments that may happen\nwill be advantageous to everyone.\nRelevant discussion is better\nsooner rather than later, and this\nis something both the Union and\nCollege needs a gentle reminder of\nonce in a while.\nTHIS WEEK\u2019S EDITORIAL\nAre you lonely?

    "content": "THE STUDENT PAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON 11\n14.11.2014\nFELIX\nComment Comment Editor Tessa Davey\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nIn the 2015 election, one of the\nlargest issues will be the size of\nthe Government. People are\nasking questions, such as \u201cwhat\nshould the Government provide?\u201d,\nand \u201chow much control should\nthe Government have in our\nlives?\u201d. These questions split the\npolitical parties, with Conservatives\ngenerally in favour of having a\nsmaller Government, and Labour\nin favour of a larger one. Parties\nhave a spectrum of answers to this\nquestion.\nAs economists, however, should\nwe even attempt to answer these\nquestions? Economists often debate\nwhether economics is normative\nor positive. Positive economists\nargue that values are irrelevant in\ndiscussion of economics, whereas\nnormative economists argue for value\njudgements on important economic\nissues. Often someone will assert\n\u201cgrowth is good\u201d or \u201cunemployment\nis bad\u201d without questioning it. In\nreality, economic issues have pros\nand cons, and affect some positively\nand others negatively. In political\neconomics especially, no answer is\nstraightforward.\nFor positive economists, there is no\ndistinction between values and truth.\nThe correct size of the government\nis a question with a correct answer,\njust like there are correct answers to\nscientific questions. These answers\ncan be found using the tools of\npolitical economics; economics\nbecomes almost scientific. A positive\nstatement might be: \u201cSweden has\na higher level of taxation than the\nUSA\u201d.\nBy contrast normative economists\nfocus on ideas like justice and\nfairness and ask what government\npolicy ought to be. For example, a\nnormative economist may say: \u201cthe\nGovernment needs to raise benefits\nbecause the poorest people need\nhigher living standards\u201d.\nPoliticians often evaluate economic\npolicy in terms of macroeconomic\nobjectives. These objectives might\nnot be in the speeches of some party\nleaders, but they are important.\nThese objectives are: growth,\nunemployment, inflation and the\nbalance of trade. One way to measure\ngovernment efficacy is whether\nthe government has used economic\npolicy efficiently to fulfil these\nobjectives.\nEconomists often talk of real GDP\nper capita. This is simply the total\namount of UK goods and services per\nperson, after factoring in inflation.\nGrowth is simply the percentage\nincrease in this quantity per year,\nand is a key indicator of a country\u2019s\neconomic performance. Currently,\nUK growth is 0.8% for the past three\nmonths, or an average of 3.2% this\nyear. The government does not set a\nspecific target for growth, but 2.5% is\nconsidered to be a sustainable level.\nAfter the recession (half a year of\nnegative growth) during the tenure\nof the previous government, this\ncould be considered a success for the\ncoalition. However, all economic\nA success for the coalition? Photo: Manchester Evening News\nThe diversity of opinion that shapes elections\nSamuel Bodansky discusses the issues in the 2015 elections\narguments have counterpoints and\ncaveats: many people question the\nway the economy has grown. Has\nthis growth come with high prices\nand unbearable living costs? Is the\ngrowth environmentally sustainable?\nSome say that this growth has\nmerely benefitted the richest in the\neconomy, as the rich get richer and\nthe poor get poorer. Does growth\njustify inequality? These questions\nare debatable, and this debate forms\nthe diversity of opinions that will\nshape the next election.\nDo you like baring\nall?\nWrite for Felix comment:\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n\n"

Those are the real things. The\nhonours are unreal to me.\u201d\nPresumably then, Feynman would\nnot have had much interest in the\nBreakthrough Prizes.\nFounded in 2012 by some of the\nworld\u2019s most famous billionaires, the\n2015 awards were announced this\nweek to recognise those scientists\nbehind the biggest \u2018breakthroughs\u2019\nin life sciences, fundamental physics\nand mathematics.\nStarting with a $3 million prize\nfund that spits in the face of the\nNobel\u2019s puny $1.1 million, everything\nabout the Breakthrough Prizes is big.\nThey aim to turn scientists into \u201crock\nstars\u201d with a star-studded, Oscarsstyle awards ceremony, and inject\nsome \u201crazzmatazz\u201d into the rather\ntedious business of curing cancer and\nfinding a theory of everything.\nOne of those funding the prize,\nMark Zuckerberg, thinks they have\n\u201cthe potential to provide a platform\nfor other models of philanthropy,\nso people everywhere have an\nopportunity at a better future.\u201d\nThose behind the project seem\nto think of themselves as doing\nsomething good for humanity:\nencouraging breakthroughs in\nmedicine, recognising genius, and\ngenerally making science seem sexy.\nHow they hope it will achieve these\nlofty ambitions, I\u2019m not quite sure.\nUnlike the excellent Bill &\nMelinda Gates Foundation, another\nbillionaire\u2019s philanthropic gesture,\nthe Breakthrough Prizes do not\ndirectly pay for any new research.\nHow is giving away $3 million to\nblow on a house or a yacht supposed\nto have a better impact on humanity\nthan using it to fund a lab? It\u2019s\nnot even like the people receiving\nthis money have gone previously\nunrecognised\u2014many are also Nobel\nlaureates, and all command salaries\nvastly greater than what the average\nresearcher could ever hope to achieve.\nThe entire project seems as empty\nas the wiry ball that serves as a\ntrophy. Among the criticism of the\nprizes was an editorial in Nature\nwhich points out: \u201cyou cannot buy\nclass, as the old saying goes, and\nthese upstart entrepreneurs cannot\nbuy their prizes the prestige of the\nNobels.\u201d\nEven its name is the biggest clich\u00e9\nin science reporting.\nUnusually for an award, news\ncoverage has been directed more\ntowards those handing out the\nprizes than their recipients. They\ncome across as a feeble attempt\nat philanthropy by a bunch of\nbillionaires who don\u2019t want to be\nshown up by Bill Gates and Warren\nBuffet. How many people could\nname a single recipient of any one\nof these prizes? So much for making\nscientists famous.\nIt\u2019s true that we need to do all\nwe can to promote science and\ntechnology. We need to make sure\nthat bright new ideas for treating\ndiseases get the funding they need\nto make it into hospitals. We need\nto promote more esoteric research\ninto mathematics and fundamental\nphysics, not just so we better\nunderstand the world we live in, but\nto lay the foundations for potential\nfuture technologies. We need to\nencourage bright young people to\ntake science up as a career, and to\nensure that the public is aware of\nthe enormous benefits of scientific\nadvancement.\nBut the Breakthrough Prizes\nachieve none of this. The way to\npromote science is by showing it as it\nis: interesting, rewarding and useful.\nScience isn\u2019t about becoming rich\nand famous. Science is about doing\nscience. Trying to dress it up with a\npointlessly large cheque really isn\u2019t\ndoing anyone any favours.\nOn Wednesday afternoon, the\nsignal came through that\none of the most ambitious\nspace missions ever attempted has\nsuccessfully landed on a comet.\nIn the ten years since it was\nlaunched, Rosetta has travelled six\nbillion kilometres to reach comet\n67P/C-G, currently orbiting the sun\nbetween Mars and Jupiter.\nRosetta arrived at the comet in the\nsummer, and has spent the past few\nweeks in orbit around it, creating\ndetailed images of the surface to\ndetermine a suitable landing site.\nThe final landing was complicated\nby the unusual shape of the comet,\nand the 30 minute delay in radio\ncommunications due to the\nenormous distances involved.\nRosetta travelled with a probe called\nPhilae, designed to detach from the\ncraft and carry out the landing.\nPhilae is equipped with two\nharpoons, intended to fire into the\nsurface and ensure it doesn\u2019t skip off\nbecause of the comet\u2019s weak gravity.\nIt carries a mass spectrometer,\nradiation detector, and high-resolution cameras.\nThe European Space Ageny (ESA)\nfirst proposed the mission more\nthan 20 years ago, to investigate the\nchemical composition of a comet,\nas well as its general structure and\nmagnetic environment. Information\non organic compounds is also hoped\nto give us a new understanding of the\npossible role of comets in the origin\nof life on earth.\nThe Rosetta probe, still in orbit,will\ncontinue to take data from above, and\nanalyse dust and gas released as the\ncomet heats up during its approach to\nthe sun.\nDespite the successful outcome.\nthe mission has not been without its\nproblems. It was originally intended\nto land on a different comet, 46/\nWirtanen, but a delay caused by a\nrocket failure meant a different target\nhad to be found.\n\"The Prizes\naim to turn\nscientists\ninto rock\nstars.\"\nArtist's impression of Rosetta in orbit around the comet.

Like British Politics\nit has all the charisma of your\naverage British politician. But\nit is important. It\u2019s important\nbecause defining the future of\nhow Universities receive funding\nis something that will affect\nthousands of young people who\n(for the most part) can\u2019t vote in the\nupcoming UK General Election\nnext May, and yet their lives could\nbe profoundly altered by the next\ngovernment\u2019s stance on this issue.\nYou might say: \u201cBut I\u2019m already\nhere, it won\u2019t affect my fees\u201d, but\nmany of these young people are\nyour brothers and sisters; your\nnephews, nieces, cousins; your\nfriends or perhaps one day your\nchildren, they are your future\ncolleagues, employees and perhaps\neven employers. And let us not\nforget that Higher Education\nFunding does not just mean\nhome undergraduates. The debate\nincludes all kinds of students and\nwhile it may be easy to focus on\nHome EU fees we should bear in\nAlex Savell and Andrew Tranter explain Higher Education\nFunding and how you can help in shaping its future\nmind that even that has a knock\non effect on what other fees\nUniversities may charge to all other\nstudents.\nAnother reason I have heard a\nlot over my time here is: \u201cWhy\nshould I bother? We\u2019ll never\nchange anything.\u201d Which I think is\nsurprisingly defeatist for a group of\nover 16,000 of the brightest people\nin the world, at an institution\nrecently listed as the second best in\nthe world, who last year managed\nto have information from their\nresponse to the government\u2019s\nImmigration Policy read in the\nHouse of Lords. And particularly\nat a time when the nation will\nbe asked to choose its next set of\nrepresentatives. This moment\npresents a true opportunity to hold\nthose we ask to lead our nation to\naccount and to raise our collective\nvoice to make a change.\nThe union over the next few\nweeks will be defining our stance\non Higher Education Funding and\nwe can only do that with your help.\nCome along to our first Union\nGeneral Meeting since 2012 at\n6.30pm on December 1st\nin Blacket\nLaboratory LT1 (Physics). The issue\nwe\u2019re looking at most closely is\nthe debate between which funding\nmodel the union should support;\n\u2018Free Education\u2019, \u2018Tuition Fees\u2019,\n\u2018Graduate Tax\u2019 or \u2018None of these\u2019\nwhich you may recognize as the less\nwell-named brother of R.O.N from\nour union elections. Many of you\nmay not be entirely familiar with\nthese models, particularly if you are\nnot a Home undergraduate yourself\nso we\u2019ve attempted to lay out the\ncase for each below.\nFree Education means just that:\nuniversity education which is free for\nall students.Education is a public good,\nnot a commodity to be bought and sold.\nHow can we compromise an idea so\nfundamentally important? Increasingly\nwe hear students referred to as\n\u201ccustomers\u201d,research being prioritised\nbased on what makes money instead\nof what serves society.That attitude\nis created by a system that is turning\nuniversities into businesses\u2013a system\nwhich cuts education funding while\nmaking students pay more and more\nludicrous sums.Free education works in\nFrance,Germany,Denmark,Sweden and\nScotland.And anyway,increased tuition\nfees basically aren\u2019t saving the taxpayer\nany money.\nFree Education is the only system\nwhich takes commercial interest out of\nthe equation,and it\u2019s the only system\nwhich doesn\u2019t leave students in \u00a360,000\nof debt.Taking a firm,principled stance\nis the only way to stand up to those who\nwould change University for the worse.\nTuition Fees are the system we have now.\nThey\u2019re not trendy or popular but at the\nend of the day they work.At the end\nof the day more students from poorer\nbackgrounds are coming to University\nnow than ever have in the past so it\u2019s not\nthe barrier to entry that some would like\nyou to believe.\nAnd is it really so bad that people\nshould have to pay for a specialized\neducation and qualification? In a few\nyears most of us will be paying income\ntax,why should we pay for someone else\nto be educated? What makes it a right\nfor those fortunate enough to score\nbetter in exams to be given more than\nthose that don\u2019t?\nPlus,tuition fees encourage\ncompetition: competition to offer\nthe best course so that they get the\nmost funding and are seen as the best\ninstitution,attract the best researchers\nand then other sources of income.\nNo one is saying Tuition Fees are\nperfect,but they\u2019re a damn sight better\nthan any other option.\nThere has to be something better than\nbankrupting the nation to pay for\nthousands of students to do Mickey\nMouse degrees or loading students up\nwith debt and making universities treat\nthem like walking income.A Graduate\ntax seeks to achieve just that.\nInstead of a loan you pay a percentage\nof extra tax on income over a certain\nvalue for a number of years.So you\nliterally pay more if you get a really\ngreat job due to your degree than if you\nstruggle to earn anything.There isn\u2019t\never an actual\u2018debt\u2019and there isn\u2019t a real\nor perceived barrier to entry to Higher\nEducation Funding.\nMy favorite thing about the system\nis those that gain the most as a result\nof their degree give back the most in\nreturn for it.That\u2019s like being able to\nonly pay for the cinema if you enjoyed\nthe movie\u2026you pay for the value of your\ndegree not the cost of it.\nWhy pick a second rate system when\nyou can have the best of both and extra\nbenefits on top?\nWhat are you kidding? These three\nmodels are so wrapped up in proving\nthat they are better than each other\nthey fail to notice that being the best\nof a bunch of bad options is still a bad\noption.Why would anyone support\na one size fits all solution to such a\ncomplex problem? Why would we\nswallow the downsides of any of these\nin order to have just one way to fund\na degree.There isn\u2019t good evidence\nto show that Tuition Fees will make\nUniversity more accessible and it will\ndefinitely cost the nation and taxpayer\nmoney.Tuition Fees leave students with\ndebts that can hang on their shoulders\nfor decades and if we supported them of\ncourse they will slowly creep upwards.\nAnd a graduate tax is a laughable\nthing to try and implement and the only\n\u2018improvement\u2019it has on tuition fees is\nhiding the amount you will have to pay\nback from you.\nWe should be campaigning for fresh\nideas and admit that it\u2019s time to go back\nto the drawing board.\nFree Education Tuition Fees\nGraduate Tax None of these...\nWhat model do you agree with most?\nThe Union over the next few weeks will be defining their stance on Higher Education Funding.Fill in the #HEF_ICU Higher Education\nFunding Survey to have your say,which closes on November 19th at Midday.\nFind it at imperialcollegeunion.org/HEF-Survey\n\n"

Minerva\nholds the freehold interest in these\nproperties, with prior planning\npermission granted in December\n2012 for c. 100,000 square feet of\n\u201cprivate residential accommodation,\nwith a basement car park and\ncinema\u201d.\nThe new application, received\nby the council on the 14th\nOctober\nand publicly viewable on the\nRBKC council website, describes\nthe proposed work as involving\n\u201cdemolition of the former Post\nOffice delivery office, Whitlock\nHouse office building and the cinema\nbuilding with retention of the cinema\nfacade to Kensington High Street.\u201d\nA major development proposal, it\nstates that its purpose is to construct\n\u201c63 residential units (including\naffordable housing units) and\nassociated residential facilities, retail/\nclass D1 and office accommodation,\ncar parking spaces, cycle parking [...]\npublic realm improvements and\nassociated works.\u201d It also mentions\nthe \u201cconstruction of a basement\nand buildings to provide cinema\nfacilities\u201d, presumably to replace the\nresulting loss of the Odeon facilities.\nIt is yet to be known however what\ncapacity this new cinema will hold, if\nit will be open to the public, or who\nwould be in charge of running it.\nTo date, over 200 objection letters\nhave been received by the council\nsince late October. Common concerns\nraised in these include proximity\nto noise and dust for residents near\nPembroke Place, the loss of small\nindependent businesses caused by\ndemolishing the W8 portion of\nEarl\u2019s Court Road, as well as potential\nhazards arising from congestion\ndue to moving the proposed new\nunderground cinema\u2019s entrance\nfrom Kensington High Street to the\nsmaller Earl\u2019s Court Road. Many\nhave also denounced the proposed\ndevelopment as \u201canother faceless,\nmonolithic building\u201d that adds \u201cno\ncultural value to our High Street\u201d.\nSeveral objection letters also\nAnger over Odeon Cinema demolition\nCarol Ann Cheah reports on controversy on High Stret Kensington\n\"Demolishing\na number\nof iconic\nKensington\nHigh Street\nbuildings,\nincluding\nthe Odeon\ncinema\"\nOn the morning of Monday\n13th\nNovember, an explosion\ndetonated by a female suicide\nbomber killed 47 people and injured\n79 others in Yobe, Niberia. The attack\ntook place at a local school, and the\nsuicide bomber entered the school\nundetected, wearing a school uniform\nand carrying explosive materials in a\nbackpack.\nThe attack follows a five-year\nIslamic insurgency in the country,\nand it is believed that it was\norchestrated by the Islamic extremist\ngroup Boko Haram.\nThe group has been responsible\nfor a number of other attacks on\nNigerians, notably the kidnapping\nof 276 girls from a town in North\nEastern Nigeria in April 2014.\nThe failure of government and\nmilitary forces to effectively fight the\ninsurgency has caused widespread\nanger amongst the Nigerian people,\nand indeed soldiers who arrived at\nthe school disaster were chased and\nheckled by the people for failing to\ndeal with Boko Haram.\nThe attack took place during an\nassembly attended by 2,000 students\nat the Government Technical Science\ncollege. Musa Ibrahim Yahaya,\none of the students who survived\nthe blast, said that he \u201c\u2026 heard a\ndeafening sound and I was blown off\nme feet. People started screaming\nand running, I saw blood all over my\nbody.\u201d\nMusa is being treated for\nsome minor head wounds but\nunfortunately some of his peers have\nmore serious injuries, some of which\nmay require amputations.\nBoko Haram, the primary suspects\nfor the brutal attack, are notorious\nviolent non-state actors, with\nideologies much like ISIL.\nThe groups advocates a particularly\nstrict form of Sharia law, and its\nultimate aim is to establish an\nIslamic state in Nigeria. It completely\nopposes Western influence on\nNigerian society, and wishes to focus\nits efforts on the mainly Christian Photo: IRIN/Aminu Abubakar (file)\n47 killed by a suicide bomb in Nigeria\n\"A female\nsuicide\nbomber\nkilled 47\npeople and\ninjured 79\nothers in\nYobe\"\nC\u00c9CILE BORKHATARIA\nNEWS WRITER\nSouthern region of the country.\nThe Boko Haram are a Jihadist group\nthat actively seek and kill people who\nengage in activities that they consider\nto be \u2018non-Islamic,\u2019 such as dinking\nalcohol, attending school if you\u2019re a\ngirl and not wearing the full niqab.\nInterestingly, for 7 years since\nthe group was founded, it was not\nso violent and mainly practiced\nits beliefs in remote villages of the\nNorth-Eastern Region of the country.\nIn 2009, Nigerian police arrested\nnine Boko Haram members who\nwere suspected to be planning\nterrorist attacks, with their weapons\nand bomb-making equipment also\nconfiscated.\nSince 2011, the group\u2019s steady\nrate of attacks has claimed many\nlives, and the attacks are only\nincreasing in scale. As the group\ncontinues to pillage the country,\nthere is increasing pressure on the\nNigerian government to deal with the\ninsurgents in order to restore peace to\nthe country.\nmention that the proposed plans\nappear to have had the height of the\nmain housing block increased,, which\nis unfavourable to residents near the\nOdeon from a privacy standpoint\n\u201cdue to increased noise and light\npollution\u201d.

With\nits existence dating back to the\n1920s, it was initially known as The\nKensington, before being renamed\nthe Majestic in 1940.It was known for\nits then-revolutionary architecture,\nas its design was a deliberate attempt\nto move away from the fairground\norigins of cinema in the day. The\nRank Organization, a now-defunct\nentertainment conglomerate, were\nresponsible for its current name after\na takeover in the late 1940s.\nThe original Art Deco interior\nof the building, is believed to be\nno longer intact, which prevents\nEnglish Heritage from listing the\nOdeon Kensington for preservation\n(it currently has a Certificate of\nImmunity which prevents it from\nbeing listed until 2018). However, the\nCinema Theatre Association suggests\nthat some of its original features may\nbe hidden by false walls and ceilings.\nA firm favourite of the late Michael\nWinner, the Odeon Kensington\nappears in the press every now\nand again as his \u201cdesignated local\ncinema\u201d. He was also rumored to\nhave made an arrangement with its\nmanagement where he donates to\ncharity every year in return for free\npick n\u2019 mix on every visit.\n\"Over 200\nobjection\nletters have\nbeen received\nby the council since late\nOctober\"\nPhoto: Nigel Howard\n\n"

The stillborn social\nnetwork appeared before us like a\nghost town in a hackneyed Hollywood\nHorror, and we curiously took a look.\nThe main discovery was a brace of\nembarrassing old photographs of\nfriends on accounts set up 3 years ago\nwhen the G+ tried to launch itself as\na competitor for Facebook, before\nturning into a glorified Youtube sign-in platform.\nOur most exciting discovery,\nhowever, is the fact that Imperial\nCollege London has been rated 4.7\nout of 5 on the site. Even better: most\nof the reviews are hilarious. They are\neither written in broken English by\npeople who have no link to Imperial\nat all or slightly twee thank-yous\nfrom former International students\n(one of whom has his profile pic as a\nselfie with the business school in the\nbackground). Total piss-take reviews\nby sarcastic home students are few\nand far between, but hilarious.\nThe only negative review was\nfrom someone who stayed in halls\nof residence over the summer and\ncomplained it was crap. However as\nthey complained in Spanish, no one\ncares.\nImperial College doesn\u2019t score as\nhighly as its physics department,\nwhich actually has an astonishing 5\nstars, based on its one review. Despite\nhaving a profile, at the stars, based\non its one review. Despite having a\nprofile, at the time of going to print,\nnobody had left a rating on the\ncentral library\u2019s page. However it\u2019s\nsuspected that Felix editor Philippa\nSkett will probably replicate the weird\nflirty relationship she has with the\nLibrary\u2019s twitter on Google Plus to\nattempt to get some form of hollow\nvalidation in her life.\nImperial is tied at 4.7 out of 5 with\nUCL, and both are ahead of KCL and\nQMUL which both have 4.4 out of 5.\nIt is important to note that Eastside\nbar, favoured by one anonymous\nDeputy President (Welfare) over all\nother bars on campus, has 4 out of 5\nBiologists \u201cenraged\u201d by inaccuracies in\nlatest Christmas advert\nBiologists were left outraged this\nweek after the unveiling of the\nnew John Lewis advert.\nThe two minute feature that has\ngone viral on the Internet, features\na small boy with a pet penguin,\nthat, according to sources \u201cdisplays\nanthropomorphic tendencies that\nare, at best, transparent replications\nof Disney-esque ideals and, at worst,\nare a disgusting attempt to replicate\nthe intricate behavioural patterns\nseen in these aquatic, flightless birds.\u201d\nThe video tells the story of a small\nboy, who, for unknown reasons, has\na singular companion in the form\nof a penguin. The boy proceeds to\nenjoy various childhood scenarios,\nwhilst the penguin seemingly joins\nin too. The bird is seen to help the\nchild construct Lego buildings, put\nChristmas lights on the tree, and even\nat one point take part in a game of\nfootball.\nThe penguin however seems\ndistressed, and is seen to stare\n\u201clongingly\u201d at those around him\ndisplaying loving affection to\npartners. The penguin soon loses\ninterest in the world around him, and\nit is only when the boy is able to buy\nand package a new female penguin to\ngift to his pet penguin at Christmas,\ndoes the male penguin become happy\nonce more.\nThe species of the penguin is\nnever specified, nor is there any\nexplanation as to why this penguin\nin particular is not residing in the\nAntarctic or in any other natural\nhabitats these flightless birds are\nusually found.\nSaid one second year ecology\nstudent \u201cThis digitalised penguin\ndoesn\u2019t bear any specific traits\nthat allow for any sort of classic\nspeciation.\n\u201cIf I\u2019m honest, I doubt they even\ntried to model it accurately on any\nsort of species, as the fact that it seems\nto enjoy sleeping on a duvet and\neating processed food indicates that\nthere were no biologists involved in\nthe script writing process at all.\u201d\nSaid another on the apparent\nmating rituals exhibited by this\npenguin, (known as \u201cMonty\u201d), the\nbehaviour exhibited was \u201cirregular.\u201d\n\u201cIn most species, the females are\nthe ones that choose a mate, often\nvia a long and arduous ritual that\ninvolves preening, nest building and\nvocal communications. In this case,\nthe female was simply \u201cpresented\u201d\nto the male in a gift box, a scenario\nthat would be highly unlikely in usual\nmating circumstances.\u201d\nOthers took issue to the breach of\nInternational animal movement laws\nthat the advert implied. A third-year\nsaid that a young boy being able to\nboth own and transport a penguin\naround Central London (on a bus, no\nless) is \u201cnothing short of outrageous.\u201d\n\u201cInternational legislation makes\nowning a penguin illegal, something\nthat this advert neglects to address.\nHe went on to add: \u201cProvisions\nshould be put in place to care for the\nanimal, such as a climate controlled\nenclosure that features large bodies\nof water that the penguin can swim\nin. None of these were evident in the\nadvert.\u201d\n\u201cIt could be possible that is penguin\nwas illegally purchased by the family,\nand could be under considerable\ndistress given the conditions it is\nhaving to reside in.\u201d\nHe explained that what may\nbe construed as \u201cpining\u201d may be\ntroubling behaviour resulting from\nnot having a large flock to reside in,\nor potentially being made to follow\naround a small boy whose taste in\nwoollen hats is \u201cnothing short of\npoor.\u201d\nNone of the sources Hangman\ncontacted wanted to comment on the\nfact that the penguin in the end turns\nout to be a stuffed toy that has been\nimagined to be real by the boy.\nThey did however discuss at length\nthe implications the advert may\nhave on the mail-order industry\nof exotic pets, the reputation of\nbehavioural biology within the wider\ncommunity and the apparent ease of\ndomestication of large birds.\nConcluded one fourth year \u201cI just\ndon\u2019t think it is fair that this advert\nhas been viewed so many times, and\nno-one is providing justification as\nto why so much of the behavioural\nbiology we work so hard to research\nhas been neglected.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t go on field courses to the\nAntarctic, trek for weeks on end in\ncold blizzards, stare at these birds for\nhours and hours, and then expect all\nof our work to be overlooked by the\nmedia.\u201d\non the social network, which means\nthat its standards must be pretty\nfucking low.\nThe penguin in question was considered by biologists to act \"irregularly\" and display \"distressing tendencies.\"\n\n"

The Medicals will be\nunable to host the Christmas Bop at\nReynolds as a result of these penalties.\nAdditionally, both the Medics 3rd\nteam who played on the 29th October\nand the ICURFC\u2019s players will be\nmade to perform \u201cUnion service\u201d.\nThe nature of \u201cUnion service\u201d is\nyet to be determined by the Union,\nhowever the ICURFC members\nare said to be keen to spend their\ntime taking part in some grassroots\nrugby training for children, through\nCommunity Connections.\nThe sanctions were announced to\nmembers of Union Council, who met\non Tuesday evening in their third\nmeeting of the year.\nUnion President Tom Wheeler\nadded that the entire ICURFC is\nbeing punished, due to the fact that\nthe club has decided that it is to take\nresponsibility for the incidents as a\nwhole, not just the individuals who\nwere responsible.\nICURFC members were reported\nto have stripped on several Tube\nplatforms on the 29th October,\ncausing a District Line train to\ntemporarily suspend its service. The\nMedicals were also recently involved\nin the smashing of a window of a\ncoach whilst on their School\u2019s Tour.\nThe Medicals also are under further\nscrutiny after alleged drunken\nmisbehaviour at the new Heston\nsports ground.\nIn a comment to Felix, Tom\ncontinued, \u201cWe, as a Union, are\nwilling to vigorously defend student-led, independent activity in the\nUnion. It is never our intention to\nstop students from having fun whilst\nparticipating in activity, however\nthese incidents clearly crossed a line.\n\u201cI believe that the decision made\nby the Governance Committee is\nthe first step of the process towards\nachieving a truly progressive,\ninclusive and positive reputation.\n\u201cThe Sabbatical Team and I are\nwilling to dedicate as much time as\nit takes to assist Clubs, Societies and\nProjects in reaching this common\ngoal.\u201d\nThe penalties against ICUFRC\nare considered stricter than those\nimposed on the Medicals, due to the\nteam\u2019s compliance with the Union\u2019s\ninvestigations. Said Tom, \u201cWe can\nonly commend George Cross [the\nImperial Medicals\u2019 Club Captain]\nfor how he has responded during the\ninvestigation.\u201d\nCouncil was also informed that a\nMotion of No Confidence would be\nbrought forward to the next meeting\nof Council against the Club Captain of\nICURFC, Thomas Hobson.\nAs it stands currently, members of\nCouncil will be voting for or against\nthis motion of No Confidence at the\nnext meeting, on the 9th December.\nTom Hobson spoke to Felix about\nthe sanctions and how this will affect\nhis team.\nSaid Hobson, \u201cI would first like\nto say that I believe these sanctions\nhave been very harsh on our club\nand all our members will feel these\npunishments. It has put all three\nteams in a very difficult position,\nhowever this is not the end of\nanybody\u2019s season.\n\u201cThe 2nds and 3rds will only miss\ntwo games, and even though the 1st\nteam will not be playing or training\nuntil after Christmas, we will still\nhave the majority of our season left.\nThis is plenty of time to regain a\ndecent league position.\n\u201cAs regards to the vote of no\nconfidence, I believe this is mainly\ndue to the fact we faced this issue and\nany consequences as a team and club.\n\u201cAs Club Captain it is natural to\nbring my position into question,\nespecially due to the media traction\nthis event gained.\u201d\nIn a statement published on the\nUnion website, a spokesperson\nsaid: \u201cWhilst we regret that some\nindividuals who may not have been\ninvolved in these incidents will suffer\nas a result of the punishments, the\nculture and behaviour of the clubs as\na whole needs to change.\u201d\nThe Governance sub-committee\nof the Board of Trustees of Imperial\nCollege Union met earlier this week\nto determine these penalties. The\nsub-committee, made up by four\nPenalties for Rugby announced\nTeams have been suspended and made to miss key matches\n\"A Motion\nof No\nConfidence\nwould be\nbrought\nforward to\nthe next\nmeeting of\nCouncil\"\nPHILIPPA SKETT\nFELIX EDITOR\nPHILIP KENT\nDEPUTY EDITOR\nmembers of the Board of Trustees,\nincluded Abi de Bruin, Deputy\nPresident (Clubs and Societies);\nAndy Heeps, Lay Trustee; Paul\nBeaumont, Council Chair; and Hiba\nSaleem Danish, a fourth year medical\nstudent who is also an elected Student\nTrustee.\nTom Wheeler and three members\nof Union staff were also present to\nobserve the meeting.\nThe decision made by the\nGovernance sub-committee does not\naffect other teams within the two\nclubs, who can, and will, continue\nto play matches in the British\nUniversity and Colleges Sport (BUCS)\nLeague.\nIn an email to the club, Thomas\nHobson advised all people in the\nICURFC first team who were not part\nof the team sheet for the match on the\n30th October to play in the second\nteam, who can still play for BUCS\npoints too.\nAs a result of these suspensions, the\nMedicals will miss three matches, but\nshould be able to make their next one\non the 10th December.\nICURFC will miss a total of four\ngames, one being a cup fixture. Two\nteams will be relegated, and the total\nBUCS points for the ICURFC will be\n0, whilst the Medicals will sink down\nto -9 points.\n\"The\nculture and\nbehaviour\nof the\nclubs as\na whole\nneeds to\nchange.\"\nWe couldn't be bothered to find another image for a rugby story.

Photo: Matt Dunham\nKamil McClelland examines the role of the Tower of London installation\n\"Whilst\nstriking in\nits scale ...\nit does not\noverwhelm\nyou as it\nshould.\"\nThe UK has been blown over in\nsupport for Paul Cummin\u2019s recent work at the Tower of London Blood Swept Lands and Seas of Red\nto such an extent that the installation,\nwhich began being partly dismantled\non Wednesday, was prolonged until\nthe end of the month. Moreover, such\nwas the public reaction that, with the\nhelp of David Cameron himself, some\nof the display will be toured around\nthe country until 2018, after which\nit will gain a permanent position in\nthe London and Manchester Imperial\nWar Museums.\nSo yes, this work was hugely\npopular and almost everyone that you\nspeak to found it intensely moving,\nespecially if they also witnessed\nthe Roll of Honour of the names of\nwar dead submitted by the public,\nannounced at dusk, a particularly\npoignant occasion. But is this way of\nremembering \u2013 a very British way\nof remembering \u2013 how it should be\ndone?\nThis, as with almost all forms of\nBritish war remembrance, focuses on\nthe victims of the war: the glorious\ndead, the heroic veterans, the\nwomen on the home front faithfully\nsupporting the war effort. And\nalthough this way of remembering\ndoes have its merits, particularly in\nthe way that it allows very personal\nreflection on one\u2019s family ties to\nwar and death, it doesn\u2019t remember\nmuch of the war itself. The poppy\ninstallation does, to some extent, give\none a sense of the scale of death and\nensures equality in death but it does\nnot particularly reflect on the reality\nof war: the horror, the death, and the\ninhumanity.\nVisual artists who have managed\nthis in the past include Otto Dix and\nFrancisco Goya, both of whom focus\nmore on the sheer terror and insanity\nof the practice. Otto Dix served in\nthe First World War on the German\nside and was deeply traumatised,\nsuffering recurrent nightmares\nof his experiences. Because of\nthis, his paintings are completely\noverwhelmed with terror and fear,\neven still after almost one hundred\nyears. His works are not about\nremembrance, they are about war:\nreal war and why it can never happen\nagain. Now where is this reality of war\nrepresented in the poppy installation?\nIt seems now that the number\nof people that lived and fought in\nthe First and Second World Wars\ndwindles to next to nothing, the\nmemories of these everyday horrors\nfades with them and we are even\nmore detached from it. And so, to\nensure these images are passed on,\nwe rely on art. The memories of\nindividuals will always be passed on\n\u2013 I know all about my relative who\ndied in the First World War \u2013 but it\nis these other factors that won\u2019t be\npassed on because they do not exist in\none\u2019s individual war narrative. Hence,\nbecause of this, we need to change\nhow we publicly remember war.\nSo why do we not focus on this?\nWhy do we not remember first and\nforemost so this never happens\nagain? I think it is because we do not\nwant to imagine these aspects of war,\nnot because we necessarily support\nwar but because we do not want to\nimagine someone ever went through\nthat.\nHow could you possibly restart\ncivil society after something like the\nhorror of the Somme? As people, we\nwant to remember our friends and\nfamily who died in war as opposed to\nthe way in which they died; we want\nto celebrate their lives as opposed to\ndwell on the evils of their death. It is\nsimply human nature.\nExhibitions like this will always be\npopular as they weigh heavily on our\nemotions and personal experiences\nbut they play no role in disgusting\nus from war. However, I feel we have\na moral duty to better emphasise\n\"We have a\nmoral duty\nto more\ngreatly\nemphasise\nthe horrors\nof war.\"\nthe horrors of war as opposed to\njust focusing on remembrance. For\nonly then will the numbers 888, 246\nactually mean something to us.\nThe installation at the Tower of\nLondon is, in this respect, indeed\nquite heartless and bland. It does not\ngive us any sense of the experience\nof war and I do agree with heavily\ncriticized Guardian writer Jonathan\nJones in his use of the word\n\u201cprettified\u201d to describe how the work\ntreats war. Also, as a piece of art in its\nown right, whilst striking in its scale\nand moving in its subject, it does not\noverwhelm you as it should.\nThe piece in itself is not moving,\nit is what it represents and how it\nwas used with a Roll of Honour that\ncreates emotion. Thus, I feel it failed\nquite crucially.\nHence, I feel we remember the\npeople of war with no regard for\nour moral duty to prevent it from\nhappening again; and it is because\nof this, as well as the fundamental\ndullness of the Cummin\u2019s\ninstallation, that makes it somewhat\nof a disappointment.\nLet\u2019s hope we have more memorials\nin the future, which do address this\nduty of preventing war as opposed to\njust glorifying its memory. Then we\nwouldn\u2019t need to remember as we do.\n\n"

Upon contacting Vincent Savolainen, Professor of\nOrganismic Biology who is based at\nSilwood, he explained to us that the\noperation of Silwood is split between\nthe parts of the campus in use and\nthe College Endowment, which takes\nassets from College once they are\nno longer of use. They then look to\nobtain \u201cbest value\u201d for these assets,\nwhich are then reinvested back into\nthe College.\nProperties currently under control\nby College Endowment include the\nManor house alongside some of the\nother buildings on site.\nSaid Savolainen, \u201cIt is now\nreviewing plans to redevelop the\nManor House. The College will\nensure that the Silwood Community,\nincluding students, are briefed once\nwe have any further information.\u201d\nVincent Savolainen led a meeting\nlast Tuesday at Silwood to address\nany questions students had, and\nthen emailed the students to answer\nany further issues. They reiterated\nthat the plans are to take place over\na number of years, and there will be\nno disturbance during exams.\nThey also explained \u201cAny parts\ndeveloped as housing would likely\nbe fenced off\u2026 The College is\nabsolutely committed to the use of\nSilwood Park as a field facility and\nthe green spaces are protected by\nlocal planning.\u201d\nHowever, some remained\nunconvinced. Said one student: \u201cIt\nseemed that the staff didn\u2019t know\nwhat was going on, although this\nmay be because they too don\u2019t have\nany definite answers.\u201d\n\u201cWe have been left with a feeling\nof helplessness. We feel that because\nmany students at Silwood are only\nhere for a year and the plans may\nnot be put into place for so long, we\ndon\u2019t really have a leg to stand on.\n\u201cWe are in the middle of nowhere,\nbut now we can\u2019t enjoy our campus\nif people are living on the site as\nrented tenants.\u201d\nNika Levikov, a taught\npostgraduate that is now in her\nsecond year at Imperial, started the\npetition that is looking to amass 500\nsignatures.\nShe told Felix that she was\ninitially concerned when the\nstudents were informed the Manor\nHouse was being sold, and then\nrumours began to spread about\nfurther redevelopment.\nThe petition, hosted on change.org,\nis targeted at Simon Harding-Roots,\nthe Chief Operations Officer, who\noversees the Estates team, which\nincludes Estates Master planning\nand Development, Estates Projects,\nand Estates facilities, as well as\nCampus Services.\nThe petition states that \u201cRight\nnow this campus is threatened by\ninfrastructure development that\nwould close off these areas to all\nstudents and staff (including the\nbasketball court). To Silwoodians,\nboth past and present, think about\nwhat we could lose and what would\nbe left for future students. Sign the\npetition to keep Silwood beautiful!\u201d\nSaid Levikov, \u201cI received\ninformation from a source I\u2019m\nunable to disclose here that\nmanagement is planning to\ndeclassify Green Belt land and sell\nit so that areas, like the Japanese\nGardens, will be destroyed and\nturned into public housing.\nSilwood redevelopments still uncertain\nPhilippa Skett investigates the plans to build flats on the Silwood site\nSilwood Manor House in happier times. Photo: Creative Commons\n\u201cI felt having this information was\nenough to go public with a warning\nto all Silwoodians about what kind\nof plans are being discussed in the\nhopes that management would\nbegin a dialogue with students.\n\u201cOtherwise I feared that plans\nwould be confirmed and land sold\nbefore students had the chance to\nreact.\u201d\nShe went on to tell Felix that she\nwould like to start a dialogue with\nthe management over potential\nplans. \u201cI think students who have\nworked so hard to come to study at\na university like Imperial have the\nright to know what is being planned\nsince they are all directly impacted\nby any kind of development.\nDestroying nature for profit is not\nan option.\n\u201cTim sent an email to all Silwood\nstudents reassuring them that\nredevelopment is not for that\npurpose. If this is the case, then\nstudents should be told clearly\nwhere the money is going and why it\nis needed.\u201d\nLevikov was unable to attend the\nmeeting Vincent held since she is\ncurrently based abroad.\nFelix also spoke to Matt Jones,\na PhD student based at Silwood\nand currently the Silwood Park\nUnion Chair. He confirmed that the\ninformation available at this stage is\nvery vague, but the land will be used\nto generate revenue in the future.\n\u201cFor Silwood to be sustainable,\nit needs to generate revenue, and\ncurrently land is being under\nutilised. Whilst it would be sad to\nlose a lot of it, compromise has to\nbe made.\n\u201cThe problem is, we don\u2019t actually\nknow what land we are planning to\nsell off. They showed us a rough map\nbut in no way is it finalised.\n\u201cThere are always rumours\nat Silwood. Why they are now\nhaving these meetings is because\nthey realise the rumours are more\ndamaging than that is actually\nhappening.\u201d\nHe explained that he has been\ninvited to a meeting in then near\nfuture with the Silwood staff and the\nEstates team, to discuss the plans\nfurther.\n\u201cTim [Barraclough, an academic\nat Silwood and colleague of Vincent]\nhas gone into the effort of answering\npeople\u2019s individual questions,\nalthough I can\u2019t say if it will be a\nshift in opinions [of other students].\n\u201cSome people are always going to\nstick to their initial opinions, but\nhopefully we are now opening up a\ndialogue between the students and\nthe people planning this.\u201d\nIt seems for now that there are\nno definitive plans for the site,\nbut many questions still remain\nunanswered. Felix will report on\nupdates as they come in.\n\n"

I am\nfrom Salcombe in south Devon. The\ninternational population at Imperial\nhas always been very stimulating for\nme. I went from a very un-diverse\ncommunity to meeting people at\nImperial who are from fascinating\nplaces.\nB: How representative do you\nthink this year\u2019s sabb team is of\nthe general student population of\nImperial?\nT: I\u2019m excited we have a postgraduate\nresearch student, Alex, as an officer\ntrustee, because we have a massive\npostgraduate population. We also\nhave Philippa, the Felix editor, who\nwas a taught postgrad student. In\nterms of the international aspect,\nwe don\u2019t have any non-EU students\nas sabbs. We are always looking to\ndiversify, but we have no input into\nwho runs and who is elected in the\nUnion elections.\nIn terms of gender, although\nthe 35:56 girl to boy ratio is not\nrepresented this year, it\u2019s not\nmassively far off, and this year is\nkind of an anomaly. The biggest\nconcern is the lack of international\nstudents.\nB: How do you think you\u2019ll address\nthis issue?\nT: We\u2019re trying to increase\nengagement. We do have a high\nlevel of engagement with our\ninternational students because a lot\nof them are members of overseas\nclubs. However, there is an issue\nbecause international students don\u2019t\ntend to run for sabbatical positions.\nThis may be because their degree\nseems like more of an investment\nbecause of the higher fees, so they\nwould prefer to do their degree then\nget a high-salary job straight away.\nI think it\u2019s a shame; I\u2019d like to see\nmore international students run in\nthe elections.\nB: But do you not think because\nthey are paying so much more,\nthey would expect higher quality\neducation and clubs and welfare?\nT: I\u2019d like to think that was a part\nof it, but the awareness of how\nmuch their degrees are costing is\ntoo much\u2026 But it\u2019d be great if they\nhad more input into how we could\nimprove how their courses are run.\nI would like to help improve things\nfor international students, but\nit is difficult, because I\u2019m not an\ninternational student myself, I don\u2019t\nhave as thorough understanding as\nthey do.\nB: What do you think about the\nsabb salary? Especially after Chris\nsaid it was too high?\nT: I have a lot of respect for Chris\nfor donating a third of his salary.\nI couldn\u2019t afford to do that myself\nbecause I\u2019ve accumulated a lot of\ncredit card bills throughout my three\nyears at Imperial, because I couldn\u2019t\nafford to live in London. So I\u2019m\npaying those off now.\nIt\u2019s also a combination of living in\nLondon and wanting to do as much\nas I can. If you look at what our\nsalary works out to be, it works out\nto be in total mid to low \u00a320,000,\nincluding living allowance. Whereas\nI think the average Imperial graduate\nsalary is around \u00a328,000, so sabbs\nare getting paid less than what we\ncould expect to get.\nI had a job offer from Deutsche\nBank before I decided that I wanted\nto do this instead. I didn\u2019t turn it\ndown for money, but because I didn\u2019t\nwant to go into that industry and\nI wanted to do more and change\nhere. I think I would have a better\nexperience here.\nB: So what do you want to do after\nyour sabb year?\nT: I\u2019m going to hopefully go and do a\npostgraduate medicine degree.\nB: Pff, woah! That is totally\ndifferent to banking! Did you\nalways want to run for a sabbatical\nposition?\nT: I was always very envious of the\npeople who had the courage to run,\nto put themselves in a public forum\nso open to judgement and criticism. I\ndidn\u2019t think I had it in me.\nAlso, because I was in my final year\nwith my friends, I didn\u2019t think my\nfriends would have enough time to\nhelp me.

A Batman\ntrilogy that revived a character\nleft for dead by the film industry (and\nin no small part helped revive a genre\nthat was under the threat of suffering\nthe same fate), a mind-bending\ntake on amnesia that deconstructed\nconventional film structures and\none of the most incredibly original\nfilms in decades, and that\u2019s barely\nscratching the surface.\nAnd now here comes his biggest,\nboldest undertaking yet. And going\nby that list, that\u2019s saying something.\nAnd yet, despite all that hype \u2013 all\nthe images of Matthew McConaughey\nin a spacesuit, exploring a new\nplanet, the shots of the incredible\nvistas \u2013 Interstellar starts off curiously\nlow-key. It\u2019s focussed \u2013 intensely\nso \u2013 on the life of McConaughey\u2019s\nCooper, a former test pilot forced to\nlead a life of farming as part of the\n\u2018caretaker generation\u2019 of Earth: those\nforced to ensure the planet ticks over\nfor the future, in the face of a vaguely\nreferenced natural disaster that saw\nfood stocks and sources obliterated.\nWithin minutes of the film\u2019s\nopening, Cooper is sat in a parent-teacher conference (to borrow\nthe American phrasing) with his\nchildren\u2019s teachers, discussing their\nrespective futures; his son Tom is\nideally suited to becoming a farmer,\nwhile his daughter Murphy \u2013 Murphy\nis something else altogether.\nIf the concept of this, a Christopher\nNolan film about space travel and\nwormholes and incredibly theoretical\nphysics, opening on a parent-teacher\nconference sounds a little jarring\n\u2013 that\u2019s most likely because it is.\nBut it works. The early scenes are\ntender, involving \u2013 and the acting on\ndisplay is top-notch from the start.\nMcConaughey\u2019s career resurgence\ncontinues unabated \u2013 perhaps\nreaching its peak here (if not at the\nstart, then certainly later), while the\nactors playing the two children both\ndeserve enormous quantities of credit\n\u2013 not least Mackenzie Foy as Murphy:\nan actress to watch if ever there were\none.\nEventually \u2013 inevitably \u2013 the film\nexpands in scope, and it does so\nsomewhat rapidly once Cooper comes\ninto contact with NASA; but it never\nloses that intensely human focus.\nCooper\u2019s goodbye to Murphy hurts,\nand the video messages sent to Cooper\nhurt just as much when the going gets\ntough.\nThis is a film about grand ideals,\nabout physics that deals with\nconcepts at the very limits of our\ncomprehension, but it\u2019s completely\nunabashedly unafraid to stick to the\ncore of what it means to be human.\nIt even throws in a grand speech by\nAnne Hathaway\u2019s biologist Brand\nabout \u2018love\u2019, and how it feels like it\nmay just be another force, another\ndimension \u2013 like gravity, or time \u2013\nthat we still don\u2019t quite understand.\nSaid speech on love is just one\nof many similar monologues \u2013\nInterstellar shares Inception\u2019s penchant\nfor incredibly exposition-heavy\ndialogue, but just as there the fact that\nit was exposition about something\ninherently fascinating \u2013 and new \u2013\nhelped carry the film through, here\nInterstellar\u2019s never-ending ambition\nand drive, as well as that human\nfocus, forces it beyond the dialogue\ninto something more.\nIf that comparison to Inception\nmakes it sound like Interstellar only\nborrows that one aspect from its\npredecessor, don\u2019t worry. The epic set-pieces are in evidence here too \u2013 if not\neven more so, on account of being set\nINTERSTELLAR\nDirector: Christopoher Nolan\nScreenplay: Christopher\nNolan, Jonathan Nolan\nCast: Matthew McConaughey,\nAnne Hathaway, Michael Caine,\nJessica Chastain, John Lithgow,\nCasey Affleck, Ellen Burstyn,\nWes Bentley\n(variously) in space itself or on new,\nuncharted planets \u2013 as is a twisty-turny plot that never quite lets the\naudience rest back in their seats.\nThere\u2019s always an underlying\ntension, not least the fact that, once\nthe journey gets underway, Cooper\nand his fellow explorers have no idea\nof what they might find. And nor do\nwe.\nInterstellar does also occasionally\nborrow the bass-heavy tendencies\nof Inception\u2019s score, at times to its\ndetriment, but on the whole Hans\nZimmer\u2019s score is incredible, bringing\nin strains reminiscent of Kubrick\u2019s\n2001 while also retaining its own\ncharacter. Unlike that other, more\nrecent space-based cinematic outing\n(yes, Gravity), Interstellar opts to\nallow to the score to continue over\nthe sections set outside the shuttle\nenvironment (although the sound\neffects do drop out accordingly). It\u2019s\na move that initially feels slightly\njarring \u2013 almost a tad inconsistent \u2013\nbut it soon comes to make sense, as\nthe score becomes indispensable, and\nthe jarring cuts in the other sounds\nare more than enough to achieve the\nnecessary contrast between \u2018in\u2019 and\n\u2018out\u2019.\nMore indispensable than the score,\nthough, is the cast. Nolan continues\nto attract the talent \u2013 including\nlong-time collaborator Michael Caine\n\u2013 and (as ever) it pays off in spades\nhere. As already noted, McConaughey\ncontinues to shine, but it\u2019s really\nMackenzie Foy who impresses here.\nThe other members of the\nsupporting cast are universally\nexcellent \u2013 Anne Hathaway brings\nher A-game to a very different role\nfrom her last outing with Nolan,\nwhile Jessica Chastain makes an\nimmediate impression in her late-game appearance (as a character\nwhose identity I won\u2019t spoil here).\nAnother A-lister also pops up\nin an unexpected role, delivering\na note-perfect performance in a\nscene that elicited horrified gasps\nfrom the audience I saw this with.\nMichael Caine manages to continue\nhis trend of making me cry in a\nNolan film, while the likes of Casey\nAffleck and John Lithgow all put in\nsolid performances. There are no\ncomplaints here.\nThere are some in other areas\n\u2013 despite my excessive praise,\nInterstellar is not a perfect film (there\u2019s\nno such thing) \u2013 but it comes damn\nclose.\nSome of the model-based shots\nare obviously of models, but in a\nfilm that manages to avoid the use\nof green screen so wonderfully,\nblending real-life sets seamlessly\nwith computer-generated visuals\n(any reaction shots to the vistas were\nachieved by projecting them onto\ncloths for the actors to look at, rather\nthan just a blank green screen), a few\nreasonably-but-not-perfectly realistic\nshots are allowable. The final stretch\nmoves away from the realistic science\nand into what can only be described\nas \u201ccompletely barmy\u201d \u2013 but it\u2019s so\nglorious it\u2019s impossible to really care\nthat it\u2019s borderline nonsensical.\nThe sound mix\u2019s occasional bass-heavy tendencies do threaten to\ndrown out key dialogue, but in the\nend it all adds into the thrill of the\nexperience, rather than taking away\nfrom it.\nAnd in the end, Interstellar really\nis an experience. I have never been\nto a film in the cinema where, at the\nend, everyone burst into spontaneous\napplause, followed by fevered\ndiscussion of myriad different aspects\nof what they\u2019d just watched. I\u2019ve never\nbeen left physically shaking with\nadrenaline, to the degree where I can\u2019t\ndo anything but sit and watch the\ncredits. I\u2019ve never been left so utterly\nconvinced I\u2019ve just watched a master\nfilmmaker deliver his finest work.\nThe Dark Knight may well go down in\nhistory as Nolan\u2019s masterpiece \u2013 and\nInception as his greatest original work,\nbut Interstellar is the culmination of\neverything he learned on those and all\nhis other films. It is the culmination\nof making some of the defining films\nof the century, and because of that, it\nis utterly, utterly glorious.\nMatthew McConaughy in the sort protection one might wandering into Metric.

Victory was sweet\nindeed.\nThe drive with the vicar was long\nand he was quieter than the History\nteacher who had given us a lift before,\nbut was kind enough to give us \u00a320\nas he dropped us off at the P&O port\nin Dover. In a theme that recurred\nthroughout the trip, our elation was\nquickly soiled after being greeted\nyet again by a horde of Warwick\nUniversity students, a body of which\nwas growing as every minute passed.\nAfter receiving no luck by the ferry\nport, we began to prowl further up\nthe road from the port in hope of\nunchartered territory and relief from\nthe piercing wind pushing in from\nthe sea.\nAfter an unsuccessful three and a\nhalf hours, we decided to fraternise\nwith the enemy. We sat down with a\ngroup of unnamed students, shared\ncake and energy drinks, then danced\nto tinny music from a compact\nspeaker to ward off the pessimism\nthat was falling over Dover like a dark\nshroud. After a further two hours\nwith them, desperately hoping that\na driver would take pity on us and\ngive us a lift, we threw our hands in\nthe air and labelled Dover as a waste\nof time. So, after exchanging a few\nmore dance-offs with a girl wearing\na fake moustache and sombrero, we\nsaid our farewell to our poorweather\nfriends and used the \u00a320 given to\nus by the vicar to escape Dover and\nhead to Folkstone to attempt the\nChannel Tunnel. We sincerely hope\nthat the Warwick students left Dover\neventually.\nAfter arriving at a roundabout a few\nhundred metres from the Channel\nTunnel grounds, we waited no longer\nthan 45 minutes until a French guy\npulled over offering to give us a lift.\nWe could not believe our luck after\nour five and a half hour wait in Dover.\nAs he pulled into the hard shoulder\nJailbreak FAQs\nHow do you get anywhere\nwithout spending any\nmoney?\nMany people have taken different\napproaches to get as far as they\ncan,most following the route\nof hitchhiking.You can also try\nfundraising to raise money to take\nplanes,trains and buy Visas.\nHow do you get back?\nYou will have to cover the cost of\ngetting yourself back [youhaveto\npaytogetback?Rip-off.\u2013Ed].RAG,\nhowever,can give you plenty of\nsupport in getting back and figure\nout the best and cheapest route\nfor your return.\nWhat if you can\u2019t afford to\nget back?\nWe will help you to find the\ncheapest possible route back,but\nof course if you are feeling brave,\nyou can try getting back the same\nway you get there,for free.\nHow do you classify the\nfurthest distance?\nAs the crow flies.\nof the slip road, we cried with joy and\nran towards the car, already thanking\nhim jubilantly as we climbed into his\ncar from the dark, chilly roadside.\n\u2018The French Guy\u201d, whose name\nwe forgot to ask, was an interesting\ncharacter. Our only record of him\nis a blurry snap of his number plate\nthat we took as we piled into his car\nand the knowledge that he had a\nlong, unspellable name. Our French\nknight-in-shining-armour turned\nout to be a student from Harper\nLee Agricultural College who was\nreturning home to Lyon for a week to\nvisit his family. We were overjoyed by\nthe news that he wasn\u2019t going to stop\nin Calais and was planning to bypass\nParis. It was fate.\nHowever, as he started the long\ndrive from Calais to Lyon, our faith in\nhim deteriorated. Although lovely, he\ndrove 30km/h above the speed limit\nand veered worryingly near cars as\nhe overtook them. We wondered at\nthe living stereotype for dangerous\nFrench drivers sitting nonchalantly\nin front of us. Although, despite his\nconcerning driving, he made for\namusing company.\nDuring a description of a wild\nnight-out where he went home with\ntwo girls in a state of pure oblivion, he\ndescribed how he \u201cfucked everything\nin the room apart from then\u201d, which\nafter a second of sleep-deprived\nconfusion we realized that what he\nmeant to say that he made a mess by\nbeing sick everywhere. We laughed\nwith chagrin at his unfortunate antics\nas the speedometer hit 150km/h.\nAt around 04:00 the speed of the\nonce hurtling car declined, and so\ndid our driver. In a bid to keep his\neyes open to watch the deserted\nroad, he began to rock back and\nforth. Just as we were about to raise\nour concern, a stomach-dropping\nTHWACK assaulted the car. At our\ngreat speed, the car had hit a hare.\nTo our bemusement, he was rather\ndistraught by the loss of life and less\nso by the detachment of his front\nbumper. After assessing the hare\ndebris spread evenly underneath\nhis car, we set on once again down\nthe abandoned motorway, where he\nstarted to flag even further until we\nsuggested he stop.\nWe pulled into a dark stop-site on\nthe motorway furnished only by a few\nbenches and a toilet block. Outside\nit was cold and rainy. After telling\nus to wake him in 20 minutes, we\nwatched our driver pick up a pillow\nand duvet from the boot and lay\nhimself down on a wet picnic bench\nand fall rapidly into a heavy sleep.\nWe sat dumbfounded and in hushed\nvoices began to seriously question the\nsanity of our driver. However, after\n20 minutes had elapsed, we awoke our\nonly option and started on the last\nleg of our journey to Dijon through a\nrapidly forming dense fog.\nBy some miracle, we arrived in\nDijon in one piece. Shortly after\narriving we discovered that we had\nwon the competition. This knowledge\nof success helped us break through\nour tiredness and organise our return\nto England via Paris.\nWe managed to secure a cheap train\ndown with minimal difficulty and\nspent the day flouncing around the\nEiffel Tower and enjoying our success.\nWe all vowed that we would do\nJailbreak again, but bigger and better\nthan even this year. Jailbreak 2014 is\nnot an experience that any of us will\nforget.\nThis approach apparently only works with Brits. Photo: Bella Dennis\n\n"

We\nwere well aware of the pros and cons\nfor both; to get a flight to Turkey\nwe would not only have had to raise\n\u00a396 for flights, but also find a way to\nget to Gatwick in time for the 18:15\nflight and pay for a \u00a320 visa each to\nallow us access to the country. Despite\nbeing an extremely attractive option,\nthe cold indifference of London gave\nus pause for thought of this plan\u2019s\nfeasibility. Getting across the Channel\nalso had its own troubling risks: where\nto hitchhike from? How difficult\nwould it be? Would we be safe? Even\nafter discussing late into the night, we\nsat squarely on a fragile fence.\nWith no set plan in mind, we set\noff in the direction of Victoria to test\nthe water and ascertain how generous\na city London truly is, with a heavy\ncynicism hanging over us. We were\npleasantly surprised with how willing\npeople were to give us money, but\nit soon became apparent that their\ngenerosity was not enough and\nraising the necessary money would\nbe too risky a venture indeed. After\nraising \u00a315, we called it quits and\nheaded for pastures green.\nAfter looking at the tangled, busy\nLondon roads in front of us we\nidentified a large obstacle that we\nhadn\u2019t yet considered: hitching a lift\nto the South-East from the centre\nwould be hard in a city where traffic\nis headed in every direction. Very\nhard. After a quick Google, we found\na helpful site called hitchwiki that\ninformed us that the best way to get\nto the Southeast was to take a train\nfrom Charing Cross to Mottingham,\nwalk to a nearby Shell garage on the\nentrance of the A20 and hitch a lift\nfrom there. So, with a train to catch\nin mind, we started a brisk walk to\nCharing Cross station.\nAs we got on the train, Will had an\nunexpected phone-call. The 3 Stooges\nhad already gotten to the Eurotunnel.\nFor a moment we sat aghast at how\nfar behind we were already. Before\nwe had even left London, they could\npotentially already be on their merry\nway to Calais. We seethed.\nAfter our train deposited us in\nMottingham, we power-walked our\nway to the Shell garage and lay in\nambush for likely victims driving to\nFolkstone, where the Channel Tunnel\nis located.\nAfter 45 minutes of springing\nourselves on unsuspecting drivers, we\nhad success with a history teacher that\nwas driving towards Folkstone to visit\nhis mother. Our first successful hitch\nwas pure exhilaration, which must\nhave surely come across as we eagerly\nthanked our generous chauffeur.\nOur chauffeur, whose name we\npromptly forgot, dropped us off at\na service station near the outskirts\nof Maidstone and kindly wished\nus farewell after a drawn out\nconversation about Ireland and the\nLondon housing market.\nNo sooner had we arrived at the\nservice station, Will received another\nunexpected phone-call, but this one\ngood. The 3 Stooges had been briefly\narrested for trying to hitchhike across\nthe Channel Tunnel whilst on the\nproperty\u2019s car park. The 3 Stooges\nwere rapidly losing their lead, and\nwe finally had news to celebrate. Not\nonly was the phone call celebratory,\nit was also informative: we now knew\nnot to attack the Channel Tunnel\nhead on, so instead we began to cruise\nthe car park for cars heading across\nthe Channel. This plan was easier said\nthan done, and became a lot more\ndifficult when another bombshell hit.\nDespite RAG\u2019s forward planning,\nWarwick University was also doing\na Jailbreak that day, which we found\nto our dismay as two other groups\narrived on the scene and started\ncompeting for lifts. An urgent race\ncovered by a thin veil of camaraderie\nensued.\nDuring our passive-aggressive\nscrambling for a car, a nice Belgian\ngave us \u20ac20 to cover costs when we\ncrossed the border, further affirming\nmy belief in the kindness of strangers.\nIt\u2019s not every day that a group of\nthree friends set off into entirely\nunknown territory,but last\nSaturday,three poised Jailbreak\nteams ran out of the Beit Quad\nand into a 24-hour adventure.\nJailbreak is a competition\nwhere teams aim to get as far\naway from their University\nas possible (as the crow flies)\nwithout spending any of their\nown money.This type of charity\nfundraising event gains more\nand more popularity year on year\nas news flies out about teams\nthat get to far flung destinations\nlike New Zealand,Singapore\nand California: all within 24-36\nhours.In times where a mere\ntrain journey to Edinburgh will\ntake a hefty chunk out of your\nbank balance,travelling to the\ncorners of the globe for free is a\ncommendable feat.\nSo,with baited breath and\nfingers crossed for success,\nImperial RAG organized its first\nJailbreak to take place on the 1st\nof November with the help of\nthe event\u2019s chosen charity,East\nAfrica Playgrounds.\nThree intrepid teams signed\nup for the task: RAGdollz,The\n3 Stooges and The Prisoners.\nIn total,the teams travelled\n1150km,with the winning\nteam (RAGdollz) travelling an\nimpressive 600km.RAGdollz\u2019s\nsuccess was made even more\nastounding considering that\nthey moved from last to first\nplace in 8 hours: a true testament\nto Jailbreak\u2019s exciting dynamism\nas a race.\nRAGdollz got as far as Dijon,\nFrance (598km) and came in\n1st place.In 2nd place came\nThe Prisoners,who got as far as\nPlymouth (304km) and in 3rd\nplace came The 3 Stooges who,\ndespite being first across the\nChannel only got as far as Lille,a\nmere 245km away.\nAfter the success of this\nJailbreak,RAG is now planning a\nsecond one for the Spring term.\nMorgan\nHeycock on\nthe RAG Dollz\u2019\nadventure to\nParis\nRAG goes\non tour \u2013 a\nJailbreak\nreport\nMORGAN HEYCOCK\nC&S WRITER\nPhoto: Non Omnis Moriar\nRAGdollz in Paris.

Within\na single scene, it will range from\nedge-of-the-seat exciting to dull-as-dishwater boring. It showcases\nNolan\u2019s talent for visual effects,\nalongside a lack of cinematographic\nprowess.\nInterstellar is, ultimately, a\ncollection of contradictions; with the\noverall impression simply an average\nbetween the very good and very bad.\nThe story, at its core, is a simple\none. The human population is\ndying, ravaged by world wars and an\nagricultural blight. The remnants\nof humanity are reduced to eking\nout a living as farmers, working the\nincreasingly infertile land. Starvation\nis all but guaranteed, and eliminating\nthe blight is no longer possible.\nHumankind\u2019s only hope for\nsurvival rests on finding a new world\nto colonise. Thus four astronauts:\nCooper (Matthew McConaughey),\nBrand (Anne Hathaway), Romilly\n(David Gyasi), and Doyle (Wes\nBentley) must travel through a newly\ndiscovered wormhole in search of\nsuch a habitable new world.\nResources for the mission are\nlimited, and the prospect of the\nreturning is dependent on finding a\nhabitable world before their fuel runs\nout. Should they be unable to return,\nthey are to colonise a new world with\nthousands of human zygotes, leaving\nthe population of earth behind to die.\nIt is an uncharacteristically\nstraightforward plot for Nolan, and\nit is a good one. It is also distinctly\nhuman; much of the best material\nin the film comes from how the four\nastronauts perceive the enormity of\ntheir mission and the prospect that\nthey may never return home.\nOf course, the core concept does\nnot justify three hours of screen-time, and thus is padded out with\nsubplot upon subplot until the film\nbecomes completely saturated with\nsuperfluous subject matter.\nSome subplots, like Cooper\u2019s\nrelationship with his daughter back\non earth, work excellently and drive\nthe plot along.\nMany others, however, are largely\nredundant and simply serve as\na soapbox for Nolan as he spews\nNew Age spiritual woo and inane\ntechnobabble. Because of this,\nMcConaughey and Hathaway are\nforced to constantly juggle multiple\ncontradictory facets of their\nrespective roles, the end result being\nthat neither performer can fully\nbring their talent to bear for any\nlength of time.\nIndeed, one of the most frustrating\naspects of Interstellar is that it is\nan excellent examination of the\nhuman condition, yet it is inhabited\nby surprisingly insubstantial and\nschematic characters.\nYet, in spite of this, it is ultimately\na good \u2013 at times great \u2013 film.\nThe use of relativity and other\nscientific tenets as plot drivers lends\nit credibility as a science fiction\npicture, while the bleak, foreboding\ntension that suffuses much of the\nfilm conjures up memories of Danny\nBoyle\u2019s Sunshine (and to a lesser\nextent, Clouzot\u2019s The Wages of Fear).\nNolan\u2019s realisation of a dying\nEarth, in contrast, is a homage to\nSteinbeck\u2019s corpus of dust-bowl\nliterature, and the juxtaposition of\nexotic alien worlds against a portrayal\nof humanity as a fading, agrarian\nsociety proves to be one of his best\nflourishes.\nThe visuals, also, are breathtakingly\nrealised; few films (Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n\u2019s\nGravity is only exception that springs\nto mind) manage to evoke the scale\nand emptiness of space as well as\nInterstellar. All in all, it is a work that\nspeaks volumes about the power of\nNolan\u2019s imagination as well his talent\nwith aesthetics and a flair with the\neclectic.\nUltimately, Interstellar is\ndisappointing not because the film\nitself, but rather what it could have\nbeen. Had the story been more\nfocused, the characters more fleshed\nout, the result would be have been\na classic piece of sci-fi cinema, of a\nquality on par with Stanley Kubrick\u2019s\n2001: A Space Odyssey. Yet, Nolan\nproves to be his own worst enemy, as\nhe sacrifices focus and simplicity for\nsentimentality and pretension.\nIn the end, Interstellar feels like a\nmissed opportunity.\nAnne Hathaway rocking the spacesuit look Photo: Christopher Nolan/\nLegendary Pictures\nThe week at Imperial Cinema\nWith the end of term little over a\nmonth away,the termly plays by the\nDrama groups are fast approaching.\nUnfortunately that means that this\nis the last film from us until the AllNighter in the final week of term.\nDawn on the Planet of the\nApes\nDirector: Matt Reeves\nScreenplay: Mark Bomback,Rick\nJaffa,Amander Silver\nCast: Andy Serkis,Jason Clarke,Gary\nOldman,Keri Russell,Toby Kebbell\nThis sequel to the 2005 hit film,\nRiseofthePlanetApes,is a return to\nthe essence of the original films:\npolitical intrigue,complex ape\nfamilies,and humans who are a bit\nsilly.\nSet a few years after the end\nof Rise,humanity is struggling\nto survive having been nearly\nwiped out by Simian Flu.The apes,\nhowever,have made the Redwoods\ntheir own and have continued to\ndevelop.When a group of humans\nare forced to enter the apes\u2019land to\nattempt to fix a hydro-electric dam\nto provide power to their colony in\nthe city,the stage is set for a tense\ndialogue between cultures.\nThe relentless plot,fantastic\nbattle sequences and decent\ncharacterisation (especially of the\napes),make this a good film,it\u2019s the\nmotion capture performances and\nvisual effects that make it great.\nHailed as the best development\nin visual effects since Avatar,Dawn\ndoes with CGI what could only have\nbeen done with men in monkey\nsuits before,make the apes look\ntruly realistic.This is mainly due\nto the use of the motion capture\ntechnology.It gives the apes true\ndepth of character\u2013this could very\nwell be the film that finally gets\nAndy Serkis the awards recognition\nhe deserves.\nIf that isn\u2019t enough for you,Dawn\nalso features apes firing machine\nguns while riding horses.It\u2019s hard to\ngo wrong with that.\nShowing19:0018thNovemberand\n19:0020thNovember\n\"Within\na single\nscene, it\nwill range\nfrom edge-of-the-seat\nexciting\nto dull-as-dishwater\nboring.\"\n\"Nolan\nproves\nto be his\nown worst\nenemy.\"\n\n"

Photo: pushstartgaming\nEamonn Postlethwaite reviews Distant Worlds: Music from Final Fantasy\nPeople not heavily invested in\nvideo games may not realise\nthe reverence and devotion\nshown to the music from a select few\nseries by the fans. One such, arguably\nthe best, example is the music from\nFinal Fantasy, which is almost entirely\ncreated by Nobuo Uematsu.\nPart of the evidence I would present\nto support this statement (ignoring\nall the Asian performances and\nhuge back-catalogue of recorded\nmusic) is this tour, now in its seventh\nyear and quickly approaching\nits one-hundredth concert. Led\nby the Grammy award winning\nconductor Arnie Roth and with new\norchestrations overseen by Uematsu,\nit travels across the globe to such\nlavish venues as the Sydney Opera\nHouse, the Royal Albert Hall (RAH)\nand the Stockholm Opera House,\nand introduces world class orchestras\n(the Royal Philharmonic last night!)\nto what I expect many in the classical\nworld would scoff at. However, there\nis an interesting fact to be noted\nhere: listeners of ClassicFM (and\nwhat better measuring stick is there?)\nvoted Uematsu\u2019s body of work as\ntheir third favourite and indeed the\npiece \u2018Aerith\u2019s Theme\u2019 from Final\nFantasy VII was the first video game\ncomposition played on ClassicFM.\nThis is the third time Distant Worlds\nhas come to England, each time to the\nRAH and coincidentally the third\ntime I made the pilgrimage. It is also\nthe third time it has completely sold\nout the RAH, this time in under two\nhours. Perhaps that is unsurprising\ngiven the predisposition to obsession\nwe gamers all seem to have about the\nthings we enjoy. To give some context\nas to why people are so fond of this\nmusic, listen to orchestral variants\nof \u2018Dear Friends\u2019 from V, \u2018Terra\u2019s\nTheme\u2019 from VI, \u2018Don\u2019t Be Afraid\u2019\nfrom VIII and \u2018Not Alone\u2019 from IX.\nAfter that brief history lesson,\nthe review. This performance was\nexceptional, and I\u2019m not saying that\nas some addled fan, foaming at the\nmouth, who would say the same if\nthe orchestra had come on stage in\nFinal Fantasy T-shirts, shat, and then\nleft. Indeed the second performance\nwas sub-par compared to the first\nand third, in terms of the selection\nof pieces and the quality of the\norchestra, presentation and sound.\nHowever for their latest effort, that\nall seemed to have been rectified.\nThe orchestra was true to the original\norchestral recordings while still\nadding enough energy and emotion\nto the pieces to make it a truly live\nexperience. Full motions videos and\nconcept artwork from the games\nwas in perfect sync with the melody\nand had moved back to the single\nscreen configuration which made the\norgan available for use in the seminal\nboss-battle theme, \u2018Dancing Mad\u2019.\nSeriously, hearing that played on\nEurope\u2019s second largest pipe organ\nwas something to behold. There was\na wall of pulsating sound towards the\nend of the organ solo where the heavy\nchromatic blocks slowly resolve into\nharmony which shook the hall.\nAnd the surprises came thick and\nfast. Breaking all tradition the first\npiece played was \u2018The Hymn of the\nFayth\u2019 from X rather than \u2018Prelude\u2019,\nan opener that features in every game\nsomewhere. This rendition (new to\nthe European tour) was beautiful in\nits simplicity. The London Voices\nChoir performed the complex\nintonation flawlessly and it was\naccented by gentle gamelan bells and\na simple string line. What\u2019s more,\nand I believe this to be one of the\nreasons video game music has such\na following, when you know what\nthe piece represents in the game (in\nthis case, the sacrifice of the self for\nthose you love, and compromise\nbetween a foul-pragmatism and a\nseemingly unreachable ideal) your\nemotional response is heightened,\nespecially when similar memories are\ninvoked in everyone you can see. The\nconcert pianist who featured as the\nfirst soloist in previous incarnations\nto play the battle theme \u2018Those\nWho Fight Further\u2019 from VII was\nreplaced by a classical guitarist who\nperformed a beautiful rendition of\n\u2018Dear Friends\u2019 from V and a lively\n\u2018Vamo\u2019 alla Flamenco\u2019 from IX.\nIt is interesting to note that \u2018One\nWinged Angel\u2019 was hastily dispatched\nimmediately after the opener, losing\nits previous encore spot. I take this\nas vindication of my long held and\nunpopular opinion that it simply\ndoesn\u2019t work in an orchestral setting.\nI don\u2019t wish to continue simply\nrecalling a list of pieces that were\nplayed and what I thought of them, so\nI shall briefly mention the highlights.\nFor me these were: \u2018Hymn of the\nFayth\u2019, the classical guitar soloist\nplaying \u2018Dear Friends\u2019 the character\ntheme medley from VI (including\nTerra and Kefka), the brand new\narrangement of \u2018Festival of the Hunt\u2019\nfrom IX, the battle medley, including\nmost importantly \u2018Battle on the Big\nBridge\u2019 from IV, and finally seeing\nNobuo himself on stage playing \u2018Dark\nWorld\u2019 with the opening credits of VI\nrolling behind him on the big screen.\nAll of this praise is not to say the\nconcert was without its problems.\nFirst and foremost in my mind is\nthe single appearance of vocalist\nSusan Calloway, the voice behind\nthe soundtracks to the two online\ngames in the series, XI and XIV. Not\nonly did she appear only once during\nthe concert, but she sang \u2018Answers\u2019\nfrom XIV, by far the weakest song she\nfeatures in, especially considering in\nthe past she has performed stunning\nversions of \u2018Eyes on Me\u2019, the love\ntheme from VIII, \u2018Suteki da Na\u2019, the\nlove theme from X and \u2018Memoro De\nLa Stono\u2019 (especially good), the main\ntheme of XI from which the name\nDistant Worlds comes.\nAlong with this, the second act\nwas almost entirely music from\nVI and IX, likely because it was the\nunofficial 20th birthday of VI and\nit happens to be one of Nobuo\u2019s\nfavourite scores, along with IX.\nWhile I agree wholeheartedly, and\nI recognise the need to alter the set\nlists to keep the experience fresh, the\nover-focus meant we only got one\npiece, namely \u2018Don\u2019t be Afraid\u2019, from\nVIII, and nothing at all from the first\nfour games. While I know it\u2019s hard\nto criticise set lists without seeming\nlike you\u2019re throwing a temper\ntantrum because you didn\u2019t hear\nyour favourite pieces, to neglect five\ngames in the series almost entirely\nseems a little fierce. Allow me a sole\npersonal gripe, that even with all this\nfocus on IX (including new pieces to\nthe European tour) they still didn\u2019t\nplay \u2018You\u2019re Not Alone\u2019 which is\nmy favourite piece, and as yet isn\u2019t\nofficially available on any of the non-Asian CD releases. Alas.\nDistant Worlds will almost certainly\ncome back to England, and I will\nalmost certainly be there again\nand again until they stop. But\nI\u2019m happy because I think, even\nafter seven years, the quality still\nkeeps increasing. The variety, the\nproduction, the performance and the\npresentation are all world-class, and\nas strange as it will no doubt seem to\npeople who have never been affected\nby a video game, the experiences,\nmorals, stories and characters (and\nof course music) will stay with me\nalways. Each performance of Distant\nWorlds reminds me to unashamedly\nfocus only on what I love and nothing\nelse.\n\n"

Eugene Smith\nFred Fyles selects a powerful work from W. Eugene Smith\nFinding Out What Makes JOHN Tick...\n\u201cThe normality of life is just\nto have someone you can\nexpress stuff with.\u201d\nDevised by DV8 Physical Theatre, a\ncontemporary dance company known\nfor their original and controversial\nwork, the atmosphere surrounding\nthe press night of JOHN was electric.\nThe production was devised\nfollowing a series of interviews\nperformed on a group of 50 men\nregarding the topics of love, sex and\nrelationships. An interview with one\nman in particular, JOHN, proved so\ntroubled and complex that it inspired\na verbatim work in which his story is\nexplored.\nJOHN\u2019s untypical life makes for a\nhard-hitting, fast paced production\nthat openly confronts complex issues.\nBorn to a violent father and depressed\nmother, his troubled childhood paves\nthe way for an even more unstable\nlife.\nThe opening five minutes alone\ninvolves a cleverly rotating stage\nin which actors flicker through\nemotional scenes of domestic abuse,\ndrug addiction, rape, and death. The\nuse of verbatim speech coupled with\nintricate and skillful dance acts to\nintensify the emotion, enticing and\nrendering the audience silent.\nThe play follows JOHN as he grows\nup, his (numerous) encounters with\nthe law, and his somewhat confused\npersonal circumstances. In his later\nlife, the concepts of male sexuality\nare explored, confronting some\nimportant themes: sex, addiction and\nman\u2019s search for something in life\n\u2013 whether love, approval or merely\ncompany.\n\"What\nsets Smith\napart from\nothers\nis his\nvision and\nfearless\nattitude\"\n\"The\nstriking\npicture is\ncomposed\nlike a\nclassical\npieta of\nold\"\nApicture tells a thousand\nwords, as the old adage goes.\nBut some of the best photos\ngo deeper; not satisfied with a word-limit of a thousand, the photographer\ninstead expands their range, taking\nin entire movements, nations, and\nhistories with their lens.\nOne such photo is Tomoko Uemure\nin Her Bath, taken by the legendary\nAmerican war photographer and\nphotojournalist W. Eugene Smith in\n197. The picture, striking in its black\nand white intensity, is composed like\na classical pieta, with Ryoko Uemura\ntaking on the role of the Virgin Mary,\ncradling her daughter Tomoko, whose\nmind and body have been withered\naway thanks to the debilitating effects\nof Minimata disease.\nThe disease, a form of severe\nmercury poisoning that destroys\nthe nervous system, was affecting\nTokomo due to the pollution released\nby the Chisso Corporation, and this\nphoto helped bring this injustice to\ninternational attention. This is what\nphotojournalists do best; wielding\ntheir camera, they act as warriors for\ntruth, unveiling what is happening\nand showing it to the waiting world.\nBut this is not only a great piece\nof journalism - it is a great piece of\nart. The composition of the shot\nis awe-inspiring, with the bathtub\nforming a dramatic diamond in\nthe centre of the frame. The loving\ngaze with which Ryoko looks down\nat her daughter contrasts with the\nlook of pain on the girl\u2019s face, which\nis drawn back in a silent scream of\nanguish. Tomoko\u2019s legs, atrophied so\nthat they resemble matchsticks, are\nsupported by her mother\u2019s strong,\nfirm arms. The lighting, which comes\nin from one direction, reflects of the\ngently rippling water, creating an\natmosphere of still and calm.\nW. Eugene Smith is a paragon\nof a photojournalist \u2013 his unique\neye, which took in horrific scenes\nin Japan, Haiti, Spain, and the US,\nis alone enough to place him in the\nhigher echelons of photographers.\nBut what sets Smith apart is his\nuncompromising vision, and fearless\nattitude. In 1972, one year after\nthis photograph was taken, he was\nattacked by employees of the Chisso\nCompany, in an attempt to silence\nhim. As a result his vision in one eye\ndeteriorated, meaning he had to take\na break from his work. It didn\u2019t stop\nhim; in 1975 he released his essay\nMinimata, and continued to release\nwork up until his death in 1978.\nThis wasn\u2019t the first time Smith had\nfaced difficulty: initially working for\nNewsweek, he was fired for refusing to\nabandon 35mm in favour of medium\nformat. Joining Life in 1939, he spent\nthe next six years photographing\nconditions in Japan, eventually\nbeing hit by mortar fire. In 1954 he\nsevered his ties with Life, owing to\ntheir interpretation of his photos of\nhumanitarian Albert Schweitzer.\nThis uncompromising attitude,\nwhich earned him a thorny\nreputation, also led to his perfectly\ncomposed work. Other pieces, such\nas his photo of a demolition team\nblasting out a cave in Iwo Jima,\nor a US soldier in Saipan finding\na wounded infant, are similarly\nshocking in their intensity.\nTomoko Uemere in Her Bath is, for\nme, a perfect example of the power\nof war photography; its ability to\ncapture the human condition, in all\nits horror, is unrivalled by any other\nfield.\nW. Eugene Smith was unique in\nthis respect, with his innate ability to\nenter into the void and then return \u2013\nnot only intact, but with pictures that\nspeak long after their subjects cannot.\nWar.What is it good for? Edwin\nStarr might think it\u2019s absolutely\nnothing,but here at Felix Arts we\ntake a more optimistic view,instead\nlooking at the artwork that war has\ninspired throughout history,from\nthe Bayeaux Tapestry to modern\nphotojournalism,in this special\nConflict Issue.\nWe start off with a look at the iconic\nphotography of W.Eugene Smith,\nand try and unpick exactly what\nthe role of a photographer is,as\nwell as the key qualities in a good\nphotojournalist.Mario Lapore then\ntake a look at the psychological\nconflict present in the tale of JOHN,\nwhose internal battles are played\nout across the stage at the National\nTheatre.\nWhat starts out as a review of\nSomerset House\u2019s new exhibition\nof photographs of ex-servicepeople,\nWounded:LegacyofWar,soon turns\ninto an exploration of what it\nmeans to remember,and the fine\nline between commemoration\nand canonisation.This topic is\nquite pertinent,especially with the\ncentenary of WWI occurring this\nweek.\nThe relationship between WWI\nand the arts has been hitting the\nheadlines recently,in no small\npart thanks to the media storm\nsurrounding the Tower of London\npoppies display,in which a ceramic\npoppy has been planted for every\nBritish serviceperson killed in WWI.\nThe debate reached a nadir this\nweek,as David Cameron publicly\nsupported extending its run until\nthe end of the year.Luckily,we\u2019re\nhere to give our own unique spin\non what the poppies mean and\nrepresent.\nContinuing on the theme of war\nphotography,we look at the ethics\nbehind the practice,and whether\nit is a help of a hindrance.With\nphotographs returning every week\nfrom the front lines of the war\nagainst ebola and Instagram users\nhitting near-critical mass,it seems\nthat there has never been more\nimportanttimeforphotojournalism.\nWe conclude with Jiaqi Shi\u2019s review\nof the new dance piece at the ROH,\nwhich revolves around the work of\nW.H.Auden and Benjamin Britten\nimmediately post-WWII.\nWar may be the engine-driver of\nhistory,but nowhere is this more\nevident than within the arts.\nEditorial:\nThe Conflict\nIssue\nFRED FYLES\nKAMIL MCCLELLAND\nSECTION EDITORS\nMARIO LAPORE\nARTS WRITER\nThis is, perhaps, not the type of play\nto bring your parents to \u2013 what with\nthe full frontal male nudity, gritty\nconversation and \u201cscenes of a sexual\nnature\u201d.

    "content": "14 THE STUDENT PAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON FELIX\n14.11.2014\nEditor Philippa Skett\nFeatures Editor VACANT\nFeatures\nfeatures.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nClimate change is a hotter topic\nthan ever. The 2014 IPCC\nreport, hot from the press,\nrecommends that 80%of the world\u2019s\npower should be from low-carbon\nsources by 2050. This will limit\nthe warming of the atmosphere to\n2\u00b0C, the agreed \u2018tipping point\u2019 for\ndisastrous consequences.\nUN Secretary General Ban KiMoon\u2019s response noted \u2018There is a\nmyth that climate action will cost\nheavily\u2019, but he commented that\n\u2018inaction will cost much more.\u2019\nThe search for sustainable solutions\nto the problem of climate change\nhas never been so important. And\nImperial is rising to the challenge.\nThis term, Imperial Hub launched its\nbrand-new \u2018Skills for Sustainability\u2019\nprogramme. Perhaps, though, our\nbiggest contribution to the cause is\nthe London Climate Forum, hosted\nhere on 22nd November.\nThe London Climate Forum is the\nbiggest student-led conference on\nenvironmental issues in the UK. Last\nyear over three hundred students\nattend to listen and engage with\ntwenty-one speakers from business,\nacademia and politics. This year the\nconference is back, aiming to repeat\nlast year\u2019s success, with a distinct\nfocus on solutions.\nThe keynote speaker, Professor Sir\nBrian Hoskins, will discuss the latest\npredictions. He returns to outline\nwhat has changed in recent years\nand what the scientific community\nreally thinks about climate change.\nProfessor Hoskins will weigh the\neffectiveness of current initiatives\nand see if we need to ramp up our\nefforts locally and globally.\nMichael Mathres, Co-Founder and\nDirector of World Climate Ltd, will\nbe launching the \u2018Road to Paris 2015\u2019\ncampaign at the forum. \u2018Road to\nParis 2015\u2019 is a new, global initiative\nto tackle climate change from the\nbottom up through collaboration\nbetween the public and private\nsectors. The campaign recognises that\nthere can be no international deal on\nglobal emissions targets without any\nagreed framework securing economic\ngrowth and prosperity.\n\u2018Road to Paris\u2019 promotes green\neconomy solutions and is endorsed\nby prominent and influential figures\nincluding Arnold Schwarzenegger.\nThrough the London Climate Forum,\nImperial is privileged to be the\nfirst university in the world to get\ninvolved with \u2018Road to Paris 2015\u2019.\nThe conference will also hear from\nSustainAbility, an environmental\nconsultancy firm focusing on\nresearch, analysis and strategic advice\nto businesses that seek to made\nsustainable changes.\nAlex Kirby, an environmental\njournalist, will represent how the\nmedia can be part of the solution.\nKirby is outspoken on the ongoing\nproblems of reporting climate news.\nEven today with scientists conducting\nground-breaking research to\nmaximise the resources of our planet\nand governments bringing in binding\nnew laws to reduce CO2\nfootprints,\njournalists are facing limits on what\nthey can report as fact.\nThis conference is about the\npotential impact students can have\nand are already having, which is\nwhy it is as much about discussion,\ndebate and interaction as hearing\nfrom eminent speakers. As part of the\nprogramme, the conference is hosting\na screening of \u2018Sunset over Selungo\u2019,\na new documentary on deforestation\nfrom Ross Harrison.\n\u2018Sunset over Selungo\u2019 takes a look\ninto the everyday lives of the people\nof the Penan tribe in Borneo and\ndocuments their struggle to protect\ntheir land from logging companies.\nRoss will be hosting a Q&A after the\nfilm screening on the \u2018Penan Peace\nPark\u2019, the response of this community\nto localised environmental\ndestruction, as well as his experiences\nas a filmmaker.\nInteraction will be encouraged\nduring the day, with workshops and\ndebates with exhibitors including\nClimate-KIC and the UK Young\nClimate Coalition. Charities and\ncompanies will be present to discuss\ntheir initiatives and how students\ncan get involved through projects,\nvolunteering and graduate schemes.\nClimate-KIC champions student\ninvolvement by offering business\nand research opportunities. With a\nsimilar focus UKYCC is run purely\nby student volunteers but works\nwith those in the very top level of\ngovernment to bring about policies\ndirectly addressing the issue of\nsustainability.\nHowever, possibly the most\nvaluable part of the conference is the\nopportunity to talk to other students.\nConsequently, delegates will not only\ndiscuss with each other their ideas\nfor environmental innovation, but\nwill also interact with current PhD\nstudents working at the Grantham\nInstitute of Climate Change and other\ndepartments at Imperial.\nIf you want to be part of the\nsolution to climate change, we\nencourage you to get involved.\nBuying a ticket to the London\nClimate Forum is just the first step in\nsaving the planet.\nPippa Smith introduces the London Climate Forum 2014\nBased at Imperial College London, the London Climate Forum is taking place on November 22nd.

    "content": "30 THE STUDENT PAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON FELIX\n14.11.2014\nTelevision Editors Guila Gabrielli & John Park\nTelevision\ntelevision.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nIs Mindy Kaling too ugly, or are you just too rude?\nGiulia Gabrielli on why The Mindy Project deserves to be taken seriously\nYet another CBS police procedural\nAfter an incredibly well received\ndebut, praised by viewers and\ncritics alike, what is happening\nwith The Mindy Project? After a bumpy\nsecond season that brought threats\nof cancellations, the Fox Network\ndecided to renew the sitcom for\nanother series.\nThis was largely due to the interest\ncreated by the finale to the willthey-won\u2019t-they between the quirky\nfemale lead, Mindy, and the attractive\ncolleague/increasingly-more-intimate-but-just-a-friend-come-on-who-are-we-kidding-here, Danny.\nNow Danny and Mindy are finally\ntogether, with the biggest drama\non the horizon being how long she\nwill be able to fake going to the gym\nin front of her man. The start of a\nrelationship like this one is often the\nend of a show\u2019s charm. Ratings have\nprogressively dropped, pushing the\nproducers to schedule 15 episodes,\ninstead of the usual 22.\nWriter/producer/star Mindy Kaling\nmust not feel great about this new\ndevelopment. Yet, she probably has no\ntime to focus on the disappointment,\nsince all her efforts have to be\nput towards answering ridiculous\naccusations. The latest being that the\nactor Chris Messina, who plays Danny,\nis too attractive for her.\nCritics (which in this context I would\nmore appropriately refer to as pure\nand simple trolls) have pointed out\nthat many of her past co-stars were\nequally \u201cout of her league\u201d. Are they\nsuggesting that she tricked them\ninto acting alongside her? Because\nany actor in their right mind would\njump at the opportunity to work with\nKaling, who has become one of the\nmost successful comedy writers in the\nUS since her participation in the show\nThe Office.\nThe long list of fitties includes\nactor Seth Rogen. How come when he\nstars in a movie where he plays the\nhusband of Australian beauty-queen\nRose Byrne, no one questions the\nplausibility of such a plotline? Mindy\nKaling is just as talented and just as\nfunny. She is possibly more powerful,\nyet she doesn\u2019t even seem to deserve\nrealistic criticism.\nYou know what? The writing on The\nMindy Project is getting progressively\nlamer since Mindy and Danny became\nan item. Its humour is more facile.\nKaling\u2019s character has become too\nover-the-top to be relatable. And\nfrankly nurse Morgan and receptionist\nBeverly are just a little bit creepy.\nHowever, how screwed up is the\nworld of TV that they can\u2019t seem to\nfind a way to criticise Mindy Kaling\nfor the content of her work? Instead\nit seems more worthy to spend time\ndescribing how she is the only fat\nand ugly lead on a sitcom, something\nwhich never happened to Seth Rogen.\nOr John Belushi. Or basically any\nother male comedian.\nI\u2019m not going to imply that our\nstandards of beauty are far off from\nwhat girls actually look like, my\nrant has gone on long enough, and I\nactually have nothing against some of\nthe beautiful actresses on our screens.\nIt just so happens that I think Mindy\nKaling is one of them. Or that, at\nleast, she deserves to have her work\nshredded to bits for slightly more\nconstructive reasons. And don\u2019t worry,\nshe can take it. In this sense alone, we\ncan say she\u2019s a big girl. Photo: Fox\nPhoto: CBS\nCBS is expertly churning out\npolice procedural shows like\nclockwork and it seems to be\nworking with the audience. Their\nnewest show, Stalker, is winning its\nnew Wednesday night slot across the\nAtlantic, competing against ABC\u2019s\ncountry music drama Nashville and\nNBC\u2019s police drama Chicago P.D. and\nit recently hit the screens over here in\nthe U.K. airing on Sky Living.\nThe premise is a rather simple one.\nEvery week there is a stalker who\nharasses someone and it is up to the\nThreat Assessment Unit (TAU), a team\nof highly skilled detectives led by the\ncharismatic Lieutenant Beth Davis\nJOHN PARK\nSECTION EDITOR\n(Maggie Q), with the newest addition to\nthe force, Senior Detective Jack Larsen\n(Dylan McDermott) tagging along, to\nsolve the mystery and catch the bad\nguy within the 40 minute episode slot.\nRed herrings are of course used\nfrequently, so the most obvious\nanswers tend not to point to the right\nperpetrator, because otherwise the\nshow would be over in five minutes.\nInstead each episode introduces nice\nlittle twists, although its amateur,\nfrankly patronising, psychological\nprofile the characters spew out\nthat help them build some sort of a\nportfolio for the man/woman they\nare trying to catch, is somewhat\nembarrassing.\nBut there is fun to be had in a\nprocedural that adds an element of\nhorror into the mix. Creator Kevin\nWilliamson was also responsible for\nwriting the Scream franchise back\nin the day, and there is certainly an\nelement of torture-porn in here,\nalthough being on a network television\nshow there is very little Stalker can do\nto push the boundaries.\nMaggie Q and Dylan McDermott\nmake a good team, with both\ncharacters carrying secrets that could\nand probably will affect the way they\ndo their jobs in the future. No doubt\nwhen it comes to the ratings sweeps\nstage some dramatic can of worms\nwill be opened that will stretch into a\ndouble-episode format.\nStalker serves well as a bit of harmless\nfun, particularly for those with an\naversion for seeing all the fake dead\nbodies the CSI franchise hurl out week\nafter week.\n\n"

    "content": "4 THE STUDENT PAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON FELIX\n14.11.2014\nNews Editors Carol Ann Cheah and Kunal Wagle\nNews\nnews.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nThis week I had the honour of laying a wreath,on\nbehalf of the Students of Imperial College,to those\nstaff and students who paid the Ultimate sacrifice in\nservice during the First and Second World Wars.The\nmoving ceremony was held in the foyer of the City &\nGuilds Building and was led by the College Chaplain\nwith a reading from the College Archivist.\nThis had me reflecting on the international makeup of our Imperial community.Remembrance Day\nand the poppy as a symbol of bloodshed and loss\nduring War perhaps seems rather anglo-centric.But\nof course death,destruction and loss happened all\nover the World.\nLast Christmas I went to Hong Kong,where I\nvisited Sai Wan War Cemetery.This was particularly\npoignant,as Hong Kong fell to Occupation on\nChristmas Day 1941.It was another 4 years before\nHong Kong was liberated,suffering some horrendous\nhardship which saw the population dwindle from 1.6\nmillion in 1941 to just 600,000 by 1945.\nSai Wan War Cemetery (pictured) is on Cape\nCollinson,on the North-East corner of Hong Kong\nIsland.There lie some 1,500 graves of soldiers.These\ninclude Canadian,Indian,British and local Chinese\nservicemen who were killed.Over 400 graves are known\nonly unto God.\nA further 2,000 names are engraved at the entrance\nto the cemetery,listing the servicemen who died in the\nBattle of Hong Kong or subsequently in captivity and\nwho have no known grave.\nThe Commonwealth War Graves Commission\nmaintains the Sai Wan War Cemetery,and is responsible\nfor maintaining the graves of some 1.7 million deceased\nCommonwealth military service members at over 23,000\nlocations in 153 countries.\nMany of these countries are represented in the\nmake-up of our community at College here today.It is\nalso important to remember that loss and suffering\nhappened on all sides during conflict.\nLooking around College today and seeing the diverse\nmake-up of our student community,all striving for a\ncommon goal,is perhaps the greatest tribute to the\nsacrifices made by our predecessors all those years ago.\nCHRIS KAYE\nCOMMENT: Chris Kaye discusses Remembrance Day\nMedical robots lab opens at Imperial\nOn Wednesday the EPSRC\nMicro-Machining Facility\nfor Medical Robotics was\nofficially opened at Imperial College\nLondon. Costing \u00a34 million, this new\nlab will allow the development of\nminiaturised surgical robotics that\ncould reshape the way diseases are\ndiagnosed and treated.\nProfessor Alice Gast, Imperial\nCollege London President and Dr\nLesley Thompson, Director of the\nEngineering and Physical Sciences\nResearch Council (EPSRC) opened\nthe Facility. The Facility will be lead\nby Professor Guang-Zhong Yang,\nDirector of the Hamlyn Centre, in the\nBessemer building, where the Facility\nis located.\nThe new facility will house\nadvanced 3D printers for researchers\nto create the surgical devices on\nvarious scales, ranging from the\nmicroscopic to the nanoscale.The\nFaculty also boasts a micro CT\nscanner that allows researchers to\nview the microscopic components\nthey are working on, alongside a\nmicro-machine assembly line.\nThe robotics that will be developed\nin the Facility will hopefully\nimprove the diagnosis of diseases\nand drug therapies, and lead to the\nimprovement of minimally invasive\nsurgical procedures.\nThe opening of the Facility also\nmeans that these technologies can\nbe developed on-site and in-house,\nreducing the cost by cutting out the\nneed for third party suppliers. This\nwill also speed up the process, making\nthe development of such robotics\nboth more time and cost efficient.\nEPSRC funded the project, and\nthe Facility is part of the UK\nRobotics Network. The Network is\nled by Imperial, and various other\nlaboratories that focus on robotics are\nscattered throughout the departments\nof aeronautics, bioengineering,\ncomputing, electrical engineering and\nmechanical engineering.\nThe launch of the Facility also\ncomes only a week after Imperial\nannounced the launch of a \u00a31.25m\nflying robotics lab. The Brahmal\nVasudevan Aerial Robotics Lab will\nbe a two-story structure that will\nfeature workshops and a working\nlaboratory. The lab will be installed\non the roof of the City and Guilds\nbuilding, and will have also teaching\nfacilities for undergraduates and\npostgraduates.\nProfessor Guang-Zhong Yang\nsaid: \u201cAt Imperial we are already in\nthe process of developing a range\nof miniaturised medical robots and\nsmart surgical devices that improve\nthe way patients in the UK are cared\nfor. Thanks to the foresight of the\nEngineering and Physical Research\nCouncil, this new Facility will speed\nup and improve development and\nproduction processes not only for the\nHamlyn staff but also for researchers\nacross the College and at other\ninstitutions.\u201d\nPHILIPPA SKETT\nFELIX EDITOR\n\n"

However, with no straight\nanswers yet available as to what this\nredevelopment may entail, rumours\nare running rife through the student\nbody based at the campus.\nThe redevelopment work in\nquestion is still in its very early\nstages, and reportedly cannot start\nuntil the nuclear reactor based on the\nsite is completely decommissioned,\nwhich won\u2019t be until 2016. However,\nwith parts of the Silwood site already\nclosed off to students, concerns\nare mounting as to what the\nredevelopments may be.\nDue to the Manor house on\nsite being a listed building, Felix\nhas been told that it may not be\ndemolished but may be rented out\nas luxury apartments, although this\nhas not been confirmed. There are\nalso worries that more buildings\nmay be placed on the green belt,\nalthough again this too has not been\nconfirmed.\nThe Manor house on the campus\nis already off limits to students after\nbeing closed at the beginning of the\nsummer. Previously, the Manor\nhouse was used for large social events\nand a conservatory was utilised for\ncoffee breaks in the morning. It\nsits in the centre of Silwood Park,\noverlooking a lot of the greenery of\nthe surrounding campus.\nHowever, these facilities have now\nbeen moved to buildings elsewhere on\nthe site and students are concerned\nthat having private residents live in\nthe centre of a student campus may\ndetract from the students being able\nto enjoy their campus in peace.\nContinued on page 5\n\n"

You might not want to\ntell people because you don\u2019t want to\nburden them, or are scared that they\nwill treat you differently. You might\navoid therapists or professional\nconsultants for fear of being labelled\nas someone with a mental illness.\nBut you can beat mental illnesses\nby yourself. I\u2019m not talking about\nmaking it magically disappear since\nit\u2019s never going to be that easy.\nInstead, you can learn to cope with it.\nYou can develop a habit to deal with\nthose phases or make them affect you\nas little as possible. So here are some\nself-help tips that you can try out.\nSelf-awareness\nAlso known as mindfulness. Basically\nbeing aware of what you think and\nhow you feel. Being aware of when an\nepisode is going to rear its ugly head\nand what thought cycles lead up to it.\nWhen you can identify what exactly\ntriggers those phases, you can calm\nyourself down and prevent it from\nconsuming you.\nFor those suffering from mental\ndisorders, you might identify two\nvoices in your head: your own and the\ndisorder\u2019s.\nOf course, there aren\u2019t really\nmultiple voices, just the kind of\nthings you think normally and what\nyou think when you\u2019re going through\na phase. With self-awareness, you can\nuntangle these two voices and know\nwhich of them you should listen to. If\nyou realize this early on in an episode,\nyou can quickly dismiss the voice of\nthe disorder and stop yourself from\nslipping further.\nHere\u2019s an example. A phase of\ndepression is often triggered by a\ndifficult event which sets of a cycle\nof negative thoughts which put the\nblame on yourself. Before you know\nit, you\u2019re depressed and when you\nwant to feel better, you find it nearly\nimpossible. So you become more\ndepressed about being depressed.\nIf the cycle of negative thoughts is\nbroken early, you wouldn\u2019t have to\nlapse into a phase at the first place.\nKeeping active\nAs difficult as it feels when, doing\nsomething active can be just the thing\nto wrest you from those monsters in\nyour head. Playing sport, going to\nIf you are concerned\nabout your own mental\nhealth,or that of a loved\none,there are people out\nthere you can talk to who\ncan give you advice,or will\nbe there to listen.\nSamaritans (24 hr\nhelpline)\nPhone: 08457 90 90 90\nWebsite: www.\nsamaritans.org.uk\nAnxiety UK\nPhone: 08444 775 774\n(Mon-Fri 9:30-17:30)\nWebsite: www.anxietyuk.\norg.uk\nNo Panic\nPhone: 0808 800 2222\n(daily,10am-10pm)\nWebsite: www.nopanic.\norg.uk\nBeat\nPhone: 0845 634 1414\n(Mon-Thurs,1.30pm-4:30pm)\nAlcoholics Anonymous\nPhone: 0845 769 7555\n(24 hour helpline)\nWebsite: www.alcoholics-anonymous.org.uk\nNarcotics Anonymous\nPhone: 0300 999 1212\nWebsite: www.ukna.org\nStudent Counselling\nService\nPhone: 020 7594 9637\ne-mail: counselling@ic.ac.\nuk\nImperial College Health\nCentre\nTelephone: 020 7584 6301\ne-mail: healthcentre@\nic.ac.uk\nYou can also go to your\nacademic or personal tutor\nregarding pastoral issues,\nespecially if you think your\nmental health might be\naffecting your academic\nperformance.\nMental health\nhelplines\nand resources\nthe gym, taking a walk in the park or\njust going out to buy some groceries\ncan break you away from the\nfamiliar environment you\u2019re always\nin whenever you experience the\nsymptoms of the mental illness.\nI understand, however, that \u2018doing\nstuff\u2019 is the opposite of what you want\nto do whenever you\u2019re going through\na phase. Depression can shoot down\nany attempts to go outside with\nquestions like \u201cWhat\u2019s the point?\u201d\nAnxiety can take you through every\nsingle scenario that can go wrong.\nBut by going outside you can prove\nthose beliefs wrong.\nDoing something, like sports,\ncan lift your mood and increase\nenergy levels. Exercising can use up\nadrenaline and other hormones that\nare produced when you are under\nstress, making you feel more relaxed.\nYou will have heard all these\nbenefits about staying active from\nyour mum when you\u2019re a kid, but do\ngive it a go. Doing something is likely\nbetter than nothing.\nMake a list\nHaving a list of things you have to\ndo or achieve written down in front\nof you will make it feel much less\nthreatening. This is particularly\nrelevant for anxiety because panic\nattacks often come when you\u2019re\noverwhelmed by everything you have\nto do.\nYou might think that you\u2019ll waste\neven more time making the list and it\nwould be one more thing to add to the\nthings you\u2019ll have to do.\nBut look at this. \u201cI will do A, B, C\ntoday, D can be done tomorrow, and\nE, F, G can be left until the end of\nthe week\u201d sounds less stressful than\nhaving all those tasks dancing around\nyour overburdened head. It gives you\na sense of control, that all these tasks\nare manageable and that they\u2019re not\ninfinite.\nFor depression, a list can also keep\nyou grounded in day-to-day life,\nurging you to trudge on and complete\nwhat you have to do.\nDoing everything in the list will\ngive a sense of achievement that can\nbreak your cycle of negativity and\nself-blame.\nBasically, the list can ensure\nproductivity, making your disorder\nbe less disruptive to your daily life.\nI hope these tips will be useful in\nhelping yourself get out of those horrible\nepisodes whenever you next experience\nit. As always, some will be more useful\nthan others, depending on the type of\nperson you are.\nSo I would recommend that, even\nthough you can manage quite fine on\nyour own talking to friends, family or\nprofessionals can really help you cope\nwith it in a way that is most meaningful\nto you.\nMaking a list can help take things one step at a time.

    "content": "Editor Philippa Skett\nFeatures Editor VACANT\nFeatures\nfeatures.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nTHE STUDENT PAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON 13\n14.11.2014\nFELIX\nwould\ner do?\nin the back of my head, but I thought\nI wouldn\u2019t be able to take 2 weeks out\nof studying. I was concerned about\nmy degree and putting too much\npressure on my friends.\nBut when I did ask my friends,\nthe support I got was absolutely\noverwhelming. Seeing my friends\npull through like they did was one of\nthe greatest things to happen to me\nduring my time at Imperial.\nI didn\u2019t expect for a second that\nthey would do anything like that\nfor me. The good stuff that they did\nhelping me impressed me so much; it\nalmost outshone the fact that I won\nthe election.\nB: Why President?\nT: It\u2019s a weird one. I\u2019m from a clubs\nbackground and I\u2019d been asked if\nI considered running for DPCS. I\nthink it was the fact that the things\nI wanted to achieve were not clubs\nbased, but what I wanted to try and\nchange was the wider relationship\nCollege has with students. College\nperceives students as customers\nand the transactional perception\nof how education is viewed upsets\nme; students are seeing education\nas a way to get a higher salary in\nthe future. I think students should\nbe more like members rather than\ncustomers and College should\nhave to engage with the students\nmore when making changes to the\neducation they are providing. An\nexample of this is moving Chemistry\nto Imperial West: where students\nwere asked what they want and\nCollege is actually doing what they\nwant.\nB: But how can this aim even be\nachieved? I thought all you could\ndo was put forward the student\nopinion?\nT: The thing my predecessor, David,\ntaught me (and what Paul taught\nhim) was that things don\u2019t get\ndecided in meetings. Things get\n\u2018approved\u2019 in meetings, but things get\nformulated outside and that\u2019s where\ninfluence comes in. As President I\nhave the most amount of influence\nof the sabbs because I can have\nmeetings with very high up people\n(like the President and Provost of\nthe College) and hopefully influence\npeople\u2019s opinion on how they\nperceive students as an organisation,\nand ideas will then hopefully trickle\ndown. I can agree that at the end of\nthe year, there will be little perceived\nchange. I know things won\u2019t change\novernight, I\u2019m a realist like that, but\nI think there will be visible change in\nabout five years\u2019 time.\nB: Do you think you can be held\naccountable at the end of this year?\nT: I hope so. A couple of things I\nwant to achieve are like that; longstanding changes in attitude, which\naren\u2019t quantifiable. But I also want\nto campaign around the time of\ngeneral elections to change student\nengagement in politics. The student\nvoter turnout is about 20% and the\nnational turnout is 40% but the\nelderly turnout is 70%. The current\nattitude is: why should politicians\nlisten to students when they get\nmore votes from the elderly? I think\nwe need to do something about\nthat. I think we should have a lot\nmore political weight. And since the\nelection\u2019s in May, hopefully I will be\nable to say more quantifiable things\nwhen it comes to accountability.\nB: Do you think student body\nshould be given a vote to decide the\nquality of job you\u2019ve done?\nT: We haven\u2019t spoken about this\nas a sabb team yet since Chris\nbrought this up. My individual\nopinion is that if we ask for a\nstudent referendum whether we get\nHonorary life membership at the\nend of the sabbatical year, students\nare more likely to pay attention to\nthe negative things that the person\nhas done and they are more likely to\nvote if they dislike the person.\nI think the students who are voting,\nif they are interested and want to\nhold us to account, they should come\nto Student Council, which is the\nforum to hold us accountable. I don\u2019t\nthink a cross-campus ballot would\nbe as representative of an informed\nopinion. Council is designed for the\nSabbs to give a balanced report about\nwhat they\u2019ve done and for their\nactions to be questioned by students.\nI do think the majority of people who\nwould vote in the ballot would not\ngo all the way to make an informed\ndecision.\nIt\u2019s quite a controversial thing to\nsay, but I don\u2019t think there would\nbe that level of engagement. I know,\nbecause I\u2019ve done a lot of surveys\nwithout having done enough\nresearch beforehand to be wholly\ninformed about an issue.\nB: Other than changing college\nattitudes, what other issues would\nyou like to tackle?\nT: The general election stuff I\nmentioned before, and the national\nmovement on \u2018lad culture\u2019, which\nis a title I absolutely detest. It\u2019s not\nrepresentative of the issue and it is\ninherently gender specific. A lot of\nresearch indicates there are a lot of\nwomen participating in it too. \u2018Lad\nculture\u2019 is defined as \u2018homophobic,\nand generally misogynistic and/or\nracist behaviour amongst groups who\nin general have been drinking and/or\nparticipating in a sport\u2019.\nGiving it a gender specific title is\ngoing to exacerbate the issue, both\ngenders should be approached,\nsaying \u2018we need to stop this\u2019. We are\nlooking at branding it as a part of the\nsolution, we are working on coming\nup with a new title for it.\nAnother issue I want to look at is\nEvelyn Gardens. They\u2019re definitely\nclosing next year for refurbishment,\nbut then the following year, there\nmight be some opportunity to push\nCollege to keep them open, because\nthey still have a 30 year lease left.\nThey are such an asset!\nB: Will the rent increase though?\nT: Absolutely, because College had to\npay so much to refurbish them. But\nwith Acton, by the time you\u2019ve paid\nfor a travel card, total cost is going\nto be the same as the refurbished\nEvelyn Gardens. But at least Evelyn\nGardens is closer, quicker and nicer.\nTying in with this, another issue\nI want to look at is the affordable\nliving cost. Currently Imperial\ncan\u2019t afford to give bursaries to the\n\u2018middle income\u2019 students, an issue\nthat I am particularly concerned\nabout. So we\u2019re trying to collate some\ndata; asking students how much their\nparents give them monthly, and\nwhere they are spending that money,\nso then we can better inform College\nabout living costs.\nB: In your role of President, who is\naccountable to you?\nT: Our predecessors have changed\nthe previous structure: I am now not\nin charge of the other sabbs, because\nthey were elected for their separate\nreasons, and it\u2019s less democratic. The\nManager of the Union reports to me,\ntechnically.\nB: So you\u2019re like the \u2018CEO of the\nUnion\u2019?\nT: Yep.\nB: Who trained you?\nT: We get training throughout\nthe induction period in the last\ntwo weeks of July. I also attended\nStudents Union conferences, about\nhow to run a student union. I also\ngot a handover from David, and\nalso have open dialogue with past\npresidents.\nB: How do you think David did last\nyear?\nT: I think David did a very good job.\nI think the most impressive thing\nhe produced was a consultation\nframework about how presidents\nshould engage with students, it offers\nkinds of rules and framework on\nwhen they need to speak to students\nand how much, improving student\nconsultation.\nB: What is the thing you most like\nand dislike about the Union?\nT: The thing I most like is that we\u2019re\nso student-led. One of the downsides\nis that students sometimes get\nfrustrated with certain aspects, like\nthey don\u2019t like queuing too long at\nthe bars and they don\u2019t like paying\nentry into the Union. Entry fees are\na contentious issue, but it\u2019s free til\n9pm and it\u2019s \u00a32 after. But all of this\nmoney is re-invested to the Union,\nwhich goes towards the students.\nB: If you had to have tinder, what\nbio would you have?\nT: Oh God knows. I\u2019d probably put\nwhat I like to do, so: skiing, climbing\nand that kind of thing. I\u2019d probably\nput how tall I am, some girls get put\noff about how tall I am!\nB: How tall are you?\nT: *no hesitation* 6 foot 3. That\nreally caught me unaware, I wonder\nwhat IS on my tinder profile\u2026\nB: Okay, say your tinder bio WAS\nactually amazing-T: What \u2018WAS amazing?!\u2019, are you\nsaying it\u2019s crap?!\nB: -and successfully earned you a\ndate but because you are so busy\nwith all your sabb duties, you don\u2019t\nhave time to leave campus, and\nhave to have your first date at an\nImperial establishment. Where do\nyou go?\nT: On campus?! Crippling! I\u2019m\ntechnically a postgrad, half staff\nmember, so probably h-bar.\n\n"

    "content": "18 THE STUDENT PAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON FELIX\n14.11.2014\nGames Editor Max Eggl & Calum Skene\nGames\ngames.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nThe Epic Return to Middle Earth\nTalion was arrested soon after for indecent exposure... oh, and for murdering a innocent orc...\nPhoto: Gamespot\nMaximilian Eggl reviews the latest addition to this titanic franchise\n\"I actually\nfelt like\nI was in\nmy own\npersonal\nLord of\nthe Rings\nmovie.\"\n\"This\none time\nreality\nmanaged\nto not\nonly hold\nup to my\nhopes but\nsoundly\nbeat them.\"\nYes, ok, the Lord of the Rings:\nShadow of Mordor was\nreleased a while ago, but\nafter completing it just last week\nand being so thoroughly impressed,\nI felt that I really needed to share\nthis with you guys. For all of you\nwho missed it, the Shadow of Mordor\nis a new Stealth-RPG style Lord of\nthe Rings game, that takes between\nthe happenings of the Hobbit and\nthe Lord of the Rings trilogy. Its\ncompletely new material that aims\nto add a new franchise and lore to\nthis already extensive world. You\nplay as the ranger Talion, who, with\nhis family, has been murdered by the\nHand of Sauron, as Sauron returns\nto Mordor. Strangely enough you do\nnot die, as your soul bonds with that\nof an ancient wraith. With your new\nadded powers of the wraith you aim\nto uncover its past as well as avenge\nyour loved ones.\nThe story of the game was\nabsolutely outstanding. From\nstart to finish I never felt that I\nwasn\u2019t playing a cheap knock-off\nof a Tolkien story, but an actual\nproper story living and breathing\nin Middle Earth. Without revealing\ntoo much (even though I really want\nto gush about the epicness that is\nsome scenes), I can tell you that\nwe see the return of very familiar\ncharacters like Gollum, as well as\nbeing introduced to new ones that\nfurther the lore. All of the cutscenes\nwere really well done, and the acting\nwas all incredibly good. So good in\nfact that I actually felt like I was in\nmy own personal Lord of the Rings\nmovie. Very rarely have I gotten\nchills when playing a game, but I\ndefinitely got them in this game.\nWhile these shivers could been\namplified because I love Lord of the\nRings so much, there still is certainly\nsomething magical about this\nworthy admission to Middle Earth.\nThe game itself takes place in\nMordor. Now the Mordor you\nprobably have in mind, is the one\nportrayed in the movies, black,\nburned and full of lava. The Mordor\nof the Shadow of Mordor, could\nnot be any different. Sauron has\njust returned back home, and his\narmies have not had a time to\nravage this green landscape. Also,\nthere is a super green area around\nthe sea of N\u00farn! How else do you\nthink that the Orcs would get their\ngrub? Magic?! So, basically you are\nsurrounded by green grass, ancient\nruins of Human buildings, and great\ntrees dotting the area you traverse.\nFurthermore, the creatures and Orcs\nthat roam this land, do so at random,\nand gives the world a vibrancy and\nlife I have found hard-pressed to\nfind in most games.\nThe missions in the story, fit in\nextremely well, and the fact that I\ncould do them at any time I wanted\nto removed the forced element\nthat you sometimes have. All the\nmissions I did themselves never\nreally followed those clich\u00e9d RPG\nmissions, where you collect stuff and\ngrind away for better gear. In fact, I\nnever felt that I needed to grind at\nany point, I rarely cared about my\nrunes I had equipped because it was\nso fun to play.\nThe mechanics of the game, while\nquite similar to the Assassin\u2019s Creed\nseries, was still really well executed.\nThe stealth element works really\nwell, and I felt so amazing when I\nstealth dropped and cut a throat. The\ncombat is also really fun, and holy\nshit those executions are really epic.\nWhile obviously there is a finite\namount of animations, it never felt\nrepetitive and I would whoop with\njoy when a particularly bloody came\nup. The only thing that I can say\nthat slightly disappointed me was\nthe whole mind control thing. I am\ndefinitely not saying its bad, and to\nbe honest I didn\u2019t really know what\nto expect, I still felt like there was\nsomething missing.\nThe thing that I really liked\nwas the whole nemesis system! I\nbrutally scarred one Orc leader\nwhile trying to kill him, but didn\u2019t\nactually decapitate him, meaning he\nsurvived! I can tell you, he definitely\ndidn\u2019t take being mutilated well.\nHis face was a horrible mass, and\naccording to information I procured,\nhe was actually unable to chew\nproperly! Basically, the fact that\nI was able to uniquely influence\nthe future of those I met, was an\nexperience that I had never had\nbefore and to perfectly frank it\nwas incredible. Furthermore the\nvendetta missions, which basically\nwere just missions to kill Orc leaders,\nbut with the twist that you were\navenging the deaths of players who\nhad been killed by these guys in their\nOWN game. This added a whole new\ndimension of interacting with other\npeople\u2019s worlds, and every time on of\nthese came up, I dropped what I was\ndoing to complete it.\nIn terms of the pedantic details,\nthe graphics and sound track live\nup to the amazing standard set by\nall the other parts of this game. The\ngraphics, are exceptional and if you\nhave a graphic card that can handle\nthe load, be ready to be awed by the\nvisual detail that will burn your eyes.\nThe water, lighting effects make for\nsuch an immersive experience and\ndefinitely the sharpest rendition of\nMiddle Earth I have ever seen!\nNow the one thing I was slightly\nworried about was replay value.\nWould I be able to pick this title up\nonce I finished it? After messing\nabout for 30 hours on this game, I\ncan tell you definitely! Killing Orcs,\ndoing sick combos and slowly taking\ncontrol of Mordor was just so fun.\nI could have probably finished the\ngame early if I hadn\u2019t been messing\nabout so much. Trust me, I will\ndefinitely be dipping back into the\nShadow of Mordor pool again.\nWhat I hope you have managed\nto convey in this review is how\nmuch this has managed to live up\nto my hyped expectations. I have\nthis amazing ability of hyping\nupcoming games to the point that\nreality cannot possibly stand up to\nmy imagination. This has ruined\nseveral game for me. As much as\nI tried to not get hyped for this\ngame, I still did. I was super excited\nwhen I finally got my hands on it.\nIn the back of my mind, I was truly\nafraid that I would once again be\ndisappointed. However, this one time\nreality managed to not only hold\nup to my expectations but soundly\nbeat them. The game made me fall in\nlove with Lord of the Rings all over\nagain. I would seriously recommend\nanyone getting it, as it is totally\nworth it.\nOnce I had finished the main story,\nall I could think was: \u201cthis was so\nincredibly good, where is the sequel,\ntake my money.\u201d Its not often that\nyou get that feeling, and one I hope\nthat you will also experience when\ncompleting this game.\nDUDE?! CAN'T YOU SEE THAT I AM BUSY??? GAWD!!. Photo: Gamespot\n\n"

The\nregular training sessions teach you to\nbe the fittest version of yourself and\nthe sessions in All Star Boxing Gym\nwill provide you with the technical\nability and mental strength to be a\ndangerous fighter. Furthermore, the\nboost to self confidence provided by\nKARTIKEYA RANA such a sport is unparalleled.\nThere are very few clubs and\nsocieties in England that provide an\nopportunity like that provided by\nImperial Boxing. The society has been\ngrowing through the years and last\nterm we became a success in competitive boxing. From conducting\nsparring matches with universities\nsuch as King\u2019s College London and\nUCL, we have also been competing in\nUniversity level boxing matches with\ngrowing success in the same!\nBut do not fear! Imperial Boxing is\nnot a place where you will be forced\ninto beating everyone up. We completely understand if you feel that\nyou are not ready or even willing to\ncompete. If your main focus is to have\na much greater level of fitness than\nyou had before then this is the society\nyou must join!\nSo if you want to be the best version\nof yourself and grow during your\ntime at university then why not give\nboxing a try?\nImmortals\nwin 12-6\nSaturday 8th November brought\nthe Imperial Immortals American\nFootball Club\u2019s first game of\nthe season against Brighton\nTsunami.It was a home game\nat the\u2018Runway\u2019Harlington and\nfrom the start the Immortals\ncame out strong and dominated\non defence shutting down\nBrighton on their first drive.\nThis brought on the Immortals\u2019\noffence who ran the ball\nhard throughout the game\nconsistently with the help of the\nnew formed offensive line,made\nup mostly of rookies or returners\nthat hadn\u2019t played line before.\nThe ball was run with success\nas both Emanuel Olagbaju and\nMohammed Hussian Noor scored\nrushing touchdowns in the first\nhalf.This took the Immortals to a\n12-0 lead at half time.After halftime the offence drove the ball\ndown the pitch but struggled to\nget the ball in the end zone,but\nthe second half was where the\nImmortals defence really stepped\nup and made some huge plays.\nThere were three interceptions\nin the game; all in the second\nhalf\u2013Alex Hitchinson made two\nand Bob Wurstelholme made the\nother.\nAnother important defensive\nplay was Harry Collini\u2019s forced\nfumble,which was recovered by\nBob and allowed the Immortals\nto maintain good offensive\npressure.Alex Hitchinson\u2019s pick\ntoward the end of the game\nallowed the offence to run the\nball out for the game.\nBrighton scored only once in\nthe game but missed the extra\npoint to make the final score\n12-6 to Imperial.This game was\nnot only a test for the returners\nbut allowed rookies to make a\nstatement,and many stepped up\nto the line and made some big\nplays\u2013showing how well they\nhave fit into the club so early on.\nThe game\u2019s MVPs (Most Valuable\nPlayers) were: Will Fulton\n(Defensive Line),Alex Hitchinson\n(Safety),Emanuel Olagbaju\n(Running Back) and Sam Hill\n(Offensive Line).This was the\nfirst game in the Premiership\nSouth Division for the Imperial\nImmortals.the Immortals are all\nfocused on carrying on this form\nand hope to make it 2-0 against\nan impressive Hertfordshire\nHurricanes team next week.\nSAM HILL\nPUBLICITY OFFICER\nKunal Wagle tells you what you may have missed out on during a busy\nweek of sport around the globe\nPhoto: Getty Images Photo: EPA\nPhoto: Getty Images\nIC BOXING\nPhoto: Getty Images\n\n"

It\nis a rowing race held annually\non the River Thames in London,\nEngland, over a much longer\ndistance than summer regattas (such\nas BUCS and Henley).\nThe course is 4.25 miles (6.8km)\nand competitors race from Putney\nto Mortlake. Wingfield Sculls is\nan invitation event with only four\nscullers racing side-by-side for the\ntitle.\nThis year Imperial was lucky\nenough to have three of the eight\ncompetitors; Tim Richards and Wilf\nKimberly in the Men\u2019s event and\nMel Wilson in the Women\u2019s event.\nImperial dominated the results\nwith Mel Wilson and Tim Richards\nwinning for us on our home water.\nThe women\u2019s race began an hour\nbefore the Men took to the water.\nImperial\u2019s Mel Wilson started\nstrongly in a contest that also\nincluded GB rowers Vicky Thornley\n(Leander) and Imogen Walsh\n(London) as well as UL\u2019s Emily Craig.\nAll four scullers reached the Mile\nPost within the course record time of\n4:44, set by Anna Watkins in 2011, so\nit was some very tough competition!\nMel took a lead and just kept building\non it, she led through every time\nmarker, also setting a new record\nto Hammersmith Bridge, bettering\nWatkins\u2019s time of 8.03 by just over\ntwo seconds. Mel\u2019s winning margin\ngave her an emphatic victory by\nmore than 16s. It was an outstanding\nwinning performance that should\ngive her confidence going forward\nthis season for both Imperial and GB.\nDefending Wingfields champion,\nWalsh, finished two seconds ahead of\nCraig with Thornley retiring after the\nChiswick Steps.\nAfter the excitement of the\nWomen\u2019s race, the Men\u2019s race didn\u2019t\ndisappoint. There was some early\nbattling between the Imperial and\nUL lightweights with Tim quickly\ntaking the lead, he pushed on and\nsignificantly increased his lead\nbetween the first mile marker and\nas he went through Hammersmith\nBridge he had gained clear water\nbetween him and the others.\nMeanwhile there was a tussle between\nhis competitors, two of whom had\nbeen his teammates at the U23 World\nChampionships last year. But as it was\nin the Women\u2019s race, Tim dominated\nfrom start to finish with a resulting\nwinning margin of 14 seconds.\nBoth Tim and Mel have joined a\ngroup of prestigious past winners.\nAfter receiving their beautiful silver\nsculls presentation boxes at the prize\ngiving ceremony, hosted by Tideway\nScullers, both Wingfield winners\nare now preparing for GB Trials,\nalongside a very large contingent\nof Imperial College Boat Club\nrepresentatives; student past and\npresent.\nSORCHA COTTER\nIC BOAT CLUB\nIC Rowers set the\nstandard\nIn recent weeks two of Imperial\nCollege London\u2019s biggest sports\nteams have been embroiled in\nvarious activities that have brought\nImperial College Union into\ndisrepute. The sanctions against the\nteams are causing innocent students\nto miss out on playing sport. Is this\ntreating everyone fairly or have the\ndisciplinarians allowed themselves to\nget influenced by the media?\nRegarding the sanctions affecting\nICURFC; it was the 1st\nteam that\ncommitted the offence not the entire\nclub, yet the whole club is facing\npunishment from the actions of a few.\nThe Union statement: \u201cWe regret that\nsome individuals who may not have\nbeen involved in these incidents will\nsuffer as a result of the punishments\u201d\nthey then go on to talk about how\n\u201cculture and behaviour of the clubs as\na whole needs to change.\u201d\nHaving been a member of a sports\nteam here at Imperial for the last\nfive years, I think it is important that\nthe Union recognises the difference\nbetween a club culture and a team\nculture. Whilst all the teams are part\nof the same club the bond between\nteam mates is completely different\nand maybe it is the team culture that\nneeds to be dealt with.\nI was Club Captain of Netball last\nyear and I think the motion of no\nconfidence against Tom Hobson\nis hugely unfair; it has made the\nissue personal. Club officers are all\nvolunteers; while nominally you are\nin charge in reality you are trying\nto manage the actions of your peers.\nThis is not an easy task. Whether\nTom\u2019s actions were \u2018correct\u2019 or\nnot in the eyes of the Governance\nCommittee he was looking out for his\nclub and his members\u2019 best interests.\nWhilst stripping down and drinking\non the tube is illegal and disruptive\nthe safety of those involved and the\npublic was not compromised, whilst\na smashed window on a coach could\nhave had dangerous consequences.\nI would infer that damaging the\nreputation of the College is seen as\na more serious offence than putting\nyourself and others at risk.\nAre Union punishments for Sports\nClubs fair?\nI think the actions of both clubs\nneeds to be punished but I question\nwhether the best decision has been\nmade and whether the severity really\nmatches up with the crime.\nAbove and below: The front pages of Felix 1586 and 1587, which broke the\nrugby stories Photo: Felix\nTONI SEMMENCE\nIC NETBALL CAPTAIN 2013/14\n\n"

He\nexplained to Felix the reasoning\nbehind the survey. \u201cWe ran the\nsurvey to try and get a more thought\nout response generally and find out\nother opinions on subjects around the\ntopic.\n\u201cWe want to then make a more\ndetailed policy from this.\u201d\nThe survey will be analysed and\nthen the policy drawn from these will\nbe presented at the General Meeting.\nAll students present will be able\nto vote to pass the policy, and add\namendments if need be, although\nthese too will have to be voted upon.\nContinued Savell, \u201cOnce we have a\npolicy, we are going to then come up\nwith a strategy to lobby parliament\nand parliamentary candidates about\nour opinion on what is best.\nPHILIPPA SKETT\nFELIX EDITOR\n\u201cWe aim to do this in the run up to\nthe general elections.\u201d\nSaid Andrew Tranter on his paper\nbeing passed, \u201cI\u2019m glad that council\nhave finally agreed to let students\nhave a vote on what our HE funding\npolicy should be.

The Meeting was held in\nJune of that year and was called to\ndiscuss alterations to the constitution.\nThe Meeting failed to meet quorum,\nwith attendance numbers failing to\nrise into double figures.\nThe debate was then taken back\nto Council, again which failed to\nmeet quorum, so the decisions were\nmade over email and reported to the\nfollowing Council meeting.\nThe meeting will be held on\nDecember the 1st\nin Blackett Lecture\nTheatre 1, although this time\ncurrently clashes with the Royal\nCollege of Science Union (RCSU)\nScience Challenge Launch.\nCouncil voted to hold the General Meeting earlier this week.

Papers require 1 seconder.\nAscheme which will move all\nundergraduate email accounts\nfrom the College\u2019s data\ncentre to Microsoft Office 365 will\nconclude today. On completion, every\nUndergraduate\u2019s mailbox will be\nhosted in a Microsoft data centre, as\npart of their Office 365 product. The\nmove promises a range of benefits,\nincluding a mailbox fifty times larger\nthan what is currently offered, as well\nnear unlimited file storage and much\nimproved collaboration of Office\ndocuments.\nWhilst the end goal should prove\nto be an improved experience, many\nusers have complained of various\nissues during the migration process,\nincluding issues syncing phones and\nwith passwords, as well as emails\nbouncing due to the move of mailbox.\nOne student commented on the move\n\u201cInitially Outlook was broken on the\nCollege machines, and now I have\nto access my emails from a different\nwebsite\u201d, with another adding \u201cIt\nmay be inconvenient now, but we are\ngetting a significant amount of extra\nspace\u201d. Most do accept that they do\nnot like change, with comments like\n\u201cI guess we just don\u2019t like change, but\nwe will adapt and grow accustomed to\nthe new way of accessing emails.\u201d\nJohn Shemilt, Imperial\u2019s Director of\nICT (who set up Microsoft Exchange for\nthe College in 1997), had the following\nto say on the move: \u201cI think there is a\nlot of publicity about the advantages,\nunlimited file storage, vastly increased\nmailbox size. We know there are some\nlimitations as well as advantages, but\nwhat we need to understand, is where\nyou and your colleagues have issues.\nWhether it is provided in house or on\nthe cloud there will be issues but unless\nwe know what they are we cannot try to\nresolve them.\nSo if you do come across issues do\nlet us know via the ICT Service Desk\n[service.desk@imperial.ac.uk], and we\nwill do all we can to resolve them with\nyou... we need to have the best service\npossible.\nThis is a partnership to make sure the\nstudents get the best value service we\ncan all achieve.\u201d\nThe move does not stop with\nundergraduates; the plan is to move all\ncollege mailboxes to Microsoft Office\n365, effectively removing College\nequipment or servers from running\nMicrosoft Exchange.\nThomas Lim on the Microsoft Office 365 disaster that is sweeping campus\nPhoto: Creative Commons\n\n"

The nuances and\ncomplexities of the poem boil down\nto a simple story set in New York:\nfour lonely strangers during the\ntumultuous times of World War II\nwho strike up a friendship in a bar,\ndeveloping into intimacy as the night\nwears on.\nThe stage design was artistically\narranged with a neon lit bar and\nAmerican-style drinking booths. The\nfour were alone in their thoughts, but\na collective conscience resonated in\neach of them, of under-achievement,\nof helplessness and confusion as the\nradio broadcasts reports of the war far\naway. They soon become acquainted,\nwith the characters deep in\nconversation discussing the anxiety\nof man and the human condition.\nRosetta, the only woman in the group,\ninvites the other three to continue the\njollity back in her apartment, which\nforms the second scene of the ballet.\nThe characters dance and pirouette\ntheir way skilfully around the stage,\nat times in frenzy and others in\nquiet contemplation. This ballet was\nundoubtedly the highlight of the\nnight, with a few pleasant surprises\nalong the way!\nAnother eminent and celebrated\ncontemporary of Auden\u2019s was\ncomposer Benjamin Britten, whose\nworks form the music for Ceremony of\nInnocence and Aeternum. The former\nis an early Britten work, when he was\nundergoing some major events in his\nlife: slowly maturing into an artist,\ncreativity stalling, having just lost\nhis mother in the same year. He was\nlosing his childhood innocence; for\none is always a child in our mother\u2019s\neyes, but she was now gone and he\nwas struggling, innocence having\nplayed a great role in shaping his\npresent life. The music grapples\nwith this profound sense of a loss\nof innocence. Choreographer Kim\nBrandstrup resolves the problem in\nthis nouveau coming-of-age story,\nsaying that we must accept that we\n\u201care going to disappear, accepting the\ndisappearance and the gaps as you go\non\u201d. Aside from all this seriousness,\nthere were some very creative\nuse of shadows and a beautiful\nbackdrop that changed dynamically,\nenthralling the audience with a\nimages of the sea, a key theme in this\nballet.\nJJIAQI SHI\nARTS WRITER\nOn 11th\nJune 1963, a Vietnamese\nBuddhist monk, Th\u00edch\nQuang \u0110\u00fac, sat down at\na busy intersection in Saigon,\nwas covered in gasoline, and set\nhimself alive. Protesting against the\npersecution of Buddhists by the South\nVietnamese government, he burned\nfor 10 minutes before collapsing\nbackwards. The act was captured by\nMalcolm Wilde Browne, a 32 year old\nphotographer, who was working for\nthe Associated Press, and the rest, as\nthey say, is history.\nTo this day, the photograph of \u2018The\nBurning Monk\u2019 is one of the most\nfamous images of all time, and joins\nthe litany of photographs of war that\nhave shocked, stunned, and changed\nthe world. But what of those behind\nthe camera? What is their role in the\nconflict?\nSusan Sontag, writing in her\nseminal volume On Photography,\nsays \u201cPhotographs state the\ninnocence, the vulnerability of\nlives heading toward their own\ndestruction; this link haunts all\nphotographs of people\u201d. So when the\nwar photographer takes an image are\nthey doing anything different from\nother photographers? By showing\nus an image of a Viet Cong prisoner\nbeing executed, Eddie Adams is\nsimply reminding us of the fragility\nof humanity, similar to what Walker\nEvans does with his documentation\nof American poverty. And yet,\nthere is something fundamentally\ndifferent about war photographs\n\u2013 becoming an observer, an act\nimplicit in the field of photography,\nis one thing, but in these situations\ndoes the photographer act as a\ncollaborator with the injustice they\nare documenting.\nJudith Butler, legendary gender\ntheorist, thinks that this is the case\nwith modern war photography,\nparticularly in the case of torture\nvictims. Regarding the use of war\nimages in the US, she writes:\n\u201cCurrently, the state operates\non the fields of perception and\nrepresentability, in order to control\neffect, and in anticipation of the way\nthat effect informs and galvanizes\npolitical opposition to the war.\u201d\nBut this doesn\u2019t take into account\nthe role that photographs can play\nin disseminating information,\nsuch as Don McCullin\u2019s work in the\nVietnam War, which galvanised\npopular opinion against the\ngovernment. Sure, images can be\nused by a government as a means of\npropaganda \u2013 see Leni Riefenstahl\u2019s\nwork which, despite its magnificence,\nis tainted by her associations with the\nNazi Party \u2013 but they can also be used\nby individuals to bring inform and\neducate.\nBut what about the idea of\nintervention? In Kevin Carter\u2019s\nPulitzer Prize-winning photograph\nof a child starving in Sudan, a hooded\nvulture leers down over the child\u2019s\nbody, as if waiting for their eventual\ndeath. \u201cSurely\u201d, some may say,\n\u201cCarter could have chased the bird\naway; he could have given the child\nfood; he could have done something\u201d.\nUltimately, Carter did the only thing\nhe knew to do; he took a photograph.\nTo say that Carter was unfeeling,\nhowever, would be churlish \u2013 he\ncommitted suicide 3 months after\nwinning the Pulitzer, leaving a note:\n\u201cI am haunted by the vivid\nmemories of killings and corpses and\nanger and pain\u201d.\nAnother issue is that of agency; to\nwhat extent do the subjects of a war\nphotograph enter into the dialogue\nabout what war is? It could be argued\nthat when a photographer takes an\nimage of their subject, they place\nthem in the position of a victim, with\nor without their consent. The person\nin the photograph is destroyed,\nand all that remains is a symbol, a\nrepresentation of warfare; it is, as\nSontag said, like the photograph is \u201ca\nsublimated murder \u2013 a soft murder\u201d,\nand by performing these actions the\nphotographer further oppresses those\ncaught up in the living hell of warfare.\nMaybe this argument makes too\nmany presumptions; perhaps those\nfeatured in the photographs are more\nthan willing to have their suffering\nrecorded and documented. More\nlikely all they want is to return to\nnormality. Could it be that war\nphotographers humanise their\nsubjects? Simone Weil, the celebrated\nFrench philosopher, puts the matter\nas follows: \u201c... to love one\u2019s neighbour\nis a question of being able to ask\nsimply: what is your torment?\u201d. The\nwar photographer poses this question\nto the subject, and then allows their\nvoice to project around the world\nthrough an image.\n\u201cSuch photographs\u201d, says John\nBerger, \u201cremind us shockingly of the\nlived reality behind the abstractions\nof political theory, casualty statistics\nor news bulletins\u201d. They reveal\nto us the world as it really is, and\nultimately this is the job of the war\nphotographer.\nThey are not part of the political\nsystem; they are not there to fight,\nor campaign, or argue; they are\nsimply there to record the truth, no\nmatter how horrific it may be. Their\nphotographs, as Berger says, \u201care\nprinted on the black curtain which is\ndrawn across what we choose to refuse\nto know.\u201d\nThe Ethics of War Photography\nFred Fyles explores the complex morals of photojournalism\nShell Shocked Soldier, Hue (1968) Photo: Don McCullin\nIf you prefer the more ethereal\n(and without giving too much away),\nthe final performance to the Sinfonia\nda Requiem ticks the box in every\ncategory: technicality, imagination\nand atmosphere.

Jacqueline\nBeddoe-Rosendo, Bianca de Blasi\nand Simone Castagno developed\nthe prototype during a UROP this\nsummer, which caters to wheelchair\nbasketball athletes and potentially\nother athletes of high-impact sports\nsuch as wheelchair rugby. The\ntechnology has been trialled with\nmembers of the London Titans\nwheelchair basketball team, who the\nteam extensively consulted with over\nthe course of the project.\nTheir solution consists of a simple\nrigid metal roller with a rubber\ncasing attached to the front bumper\nof a sports wheelchair, which rotates\nin only one direction. Containing a\nclutch mechanism and coated with\nanti-slip PVC tape, this is designed\nto provide a lockable pivot point\nbetween the front bumper and the\nfloor. This allows the player to push\nthemselves up and resume playing in\nless time.\nBianca de Blasi, in her 4th\nyear of\nBioengineering, cites the durability,\nease of use and simple replacement/\nmaintenance of the roller. \u201cMore\nimportantly, it also fits with\nwheelchair basketball regulations \u2013\nfor example, the tape that we put on\nthe roller does not leave marks on the\nbasketball court.\u201d\nThe team also made a video, which\nhas been published on the Imperial\nnews website, demonstrating how the\nroller works in two different cases:\nathletes who have weaker upper arm\nstrength (and cannot push themselves\nup) due to having no abdominal\ncontrol, and athletes who do have\nsome abdominal control. This\nvariation is due to the varying degrees\nof spinal cord injury (and therefore\nparalysis) present in different\nwheelchair athletes.\nIn the video, Jacqueline BeddoeRosendo, also in her 4th year of\nBioengineering, explained the\nchallenges that wheelchair basketball\nathletes face. \u201cDuring matches,\ncollisions are very frequent and these\noften lead to players toppling over.\nThese cause disruptions to the game\nbecause in many cases, these players\nSelf-righting wheelchair technology\ndeveloped by students\nPhoto: Imperial College Union\nUnion\u2019s Annual Report celebrates a succesful year\nPHILIP KENT\nEarlier this week, the Union\nreleased the 2013/14 Annual\nReport. This document,\nprepared by Union managers and\nofficer trustees, provides a summary\nof the activities of the Union over the\nlast financial year.\nAs with previous editions, the\nreport was opened by the exiting\nUnion President, in this instance\nDavid Goldsmith.\nIn his opening statement, David\nhighlighted the Union\u2019s main\nachievements from last year.\nOpening with the Union\u2019s successful\nlobbying of the House of Lords over\nthe Immigration Bill, he continued\nonto the Residential Experience\nReview and Student Academic Choice\nAwards.\nMeanwhile, Chair of the Board\nof Trustees Dame Julia Higgins\npraised the Union\u2019s new governance\narrangements as brought in as part of\nthe new constitution.\nAside from detailed coverage of the\nUnion\u2019s achievements and statistics\nover the past financial year, which\nalso included the Representation\nConference and improved\nsatisfaction in the Union survey,\ncoverage has also been given to the\nUnion\u2019s plans for this financial year.\nAs the year is still in its infancy,\nit gives some insight as to what the\nUnion has planned going forward.\nThese include new \u201cexit interview\u201d\nand \u201cdevelopment plan\u201d schemes to\nincrease the support given to Club,\nSociety & Project (CSP) officers, a new\nreport on \u201cdiversity, inclusion, and\nliberation\u201d, expansion of customer\npromises, and proposals from a\nDemocracy Review by March 2015.\nThe Annual Report also contains\nthe Union\u2019s financial statements,\nwhich are produced and audited each\nyear in line with Charity Commission\nguidelines.\nThis year, the Union reported an\noverall profit of around \u00a355,000,\nalthough this is partially due to an\nincrease in grant from College and an\nincreased value of the services College\nprovide free of charge to the Union.\nOnce CSP finances have been\nexcluded, as they are held in a\nrestricted fund separate from other\noperations, the actual profit is closer\nto \u00a3160,000.\nExpenditure has hugely increased\nin the activity of \u201cSocial Enterprise\u201d \u2013\na somewhat arbitrary label referring\nto the bars and retail outlets. This\nyear, the Union\u2019s commercial\noperations have run at a loss almost\ntwice the value of last year\u2019s, being\nsubsidised by other operations,\nalthough this is likely due to an\nincrease (of 23) in the number of\nstudent staff.\nIn a welcome page to the report, the\nUnion\u2019s Managing Director noted\nthat \u201cTogether we have taken the\nUnion from a precarious position\nin 2011 to an organisation with a\nstrong balance sheet, three successive\nyears of strong surpluses and a clear\nvision for the financial future for\nthe organisation,\u201d reflecting the\nsignificant improvements the Union\nhas made financially since a number\nof deficits in the early part of the\ndecade.\nThe report is available for download\nfrom the Union\u2019s website.\nDEPUTY EDITOR\ncannot right themselves.\u201d\nWheelchair basketball athletes are\nstrapped into the wheelchair and\noften have the ability to move it into\na frontal position in the event of a\ncrash, but find it difficult to push the\nwheelchair upright by themselves\nbecause of the way they are currently\ndesigned. At present, players often\nrely on officials to stop the match\nclock during a collision and bring\nexternal assistance in order to re-right them, or for other players to\nstop playing and help them up. This\nis often time-consuming and disrupts\nthe flow of the game.\nThe UROP itself was a spin-off\nfrom a second year Bioengineering\nGroup Design Project in the 2012/13\nacademic year, which the three\npreviously worked on as part of a\nlarger group with a number of other\ncoursemates.\nAn initial prototype, which utilized\ndifferent attachment methods and\ndark sandpaper, was first produced\nby the larger group, which was also\ndemonstrated at the 2013 Imperial\nFestival. The final prototype\nproduced by Beddoe-Rosendo,\nde Blasi and Castagno solves the\nissues that the first one faced with\nregulation compliance (sandpaper\nwould damage the rink flooring),\nas well as the durability of device\nattachments and materials.\nBoth the group design projects (part\nof the second-year Bioengineering\ncurriculum) and the UROP are part\nof the five-year Rio Tinto-sponsored\nSports Innovation Challenge. Now\nin its third year, the challenge aims\nto widen the accessibility of sports to\ndisabled athletes, as well as improve\nthe training and competition\nequipment available to them, by\nharnessing the skills and creativity\nof Imperial students. To speed up\nthe process of bringing their product\nto market, the team is approaching\nsports wheelchair manufacturers and\noffering their technology for free as a\nphilanthropic gesture.\nNow a graduate student in\nImperial\u2019s Department of Medicine,\nSimone Castagno said: \u201cWe want to\nempower players who compete in\nwheelchair sports, so that they don\u2019t\nhave to rely on others to get them\nupright and in back in the game.\nUltimately, we hope to see our device\nbeing used by sportspeople in the\nnear future.\u201d\nCAROL ANN CHEAH\nSECTION EDITOR\nField testing at Imperial College Photo: Imperial College\n\n"

I\nfeared it might just be an attempt\nfor Bryan Adams, the photographer,\nto try and reinvent himself, having\nbeen a washed up pop star for so\nlong. Moreover, the advertising\nmade it seem like just another one\nof those populist exhibitions, raking\nin plenty of publicity for Somerset\nHouse without actually having much\nsubstance. But it has got a lot of\nattention and will surely be popular,\nespecially seeing that it opened just\nafter Remembrance Day, ensuring\npeople are still caught up in an\nemotional frenzy stirred up by our\nnationalistic media.\nUnfortunately, it was just as I\nexpected. The bandying around of\n\u201cmodern-day heroes\u201d and \u201cband of\nbrothers\u201d, such emotive phrases,\ngives you an idea of the tone of the\nshow, not attempting to say \u201cnever\nagain\u201d, but in fact glorifying the\nwar, telling us what role models\nthese brave veterans are. As soon\nas you walked into the three-room\nexhibition space, you were faced\nwith a huge photograph not of\nthe veterans as promised, but of a\nUnion Jack, torn but still flapping\nmajestically in the breeze. The\nagenda of this exhibition was so\nobvious, they might as well have\nspelled it out (which they kind of\ndid in the introduction literature)!\nAnd this one picture pretty much\nsums everything up, I don\u2019t even\nneed to say any more. The exhibition\nhad absolutely no depth and was\nsteadfastly sticking to this patriotic\nline; it was predictable and utterly\ndull.\n\u2018Disabilities serve as a reminder of\nthe battles beyond combat\u2019 claims\nthe show but I saw no attempts\nto reveal some of the darkness\nbehind these deformities. Adams\nphotographs these men with no\ncontext to the horrifying war they\nwere involved in, with their white\nbackdrop acting to conceal all of\nthe horror behind it. Described\nby one serviceman as \u201cthe most\nreal depiction of our lives I\u2019ve ever\nseen\u201d, I would love to see what every\nother disabled veteran would have\nto say about that. Yes, it showed\ndisfigurements that would otherwise\nnot be seen but that is where\nattempts to depict the reality of their\nlives ended.\nIs that really the reality of their\nlives: standing proudly in a blank\nroom as if they were some kind\nof classical statue? What about\nthe reality of lives torn apart by\ndisfigurement, of people battling\nwith depression, PTSD and broken\nfamilies; that is the photography I\nwant to see. All this exhibition does\nis tell the same old story, putting\na patriotic fa\u00e7ade on an extremely\nimportant issue. Where are the\nLieutenant Dans? I can\u2019t imagine\nAdams going down to seedy bars\nand strip clubs photographing\nthe veterans who hate their own\nexistence, simply because that\ndoesn\u2019t follow his shallow and\nunimaginative narrative. He is\ncompletely warping reality and the\ntrue legacy of war whilst offering\nforward no counter narrative of any\nauthenticity.\nAnd can one call an artwork\neffective if it requires a whole script\nbeside it to explain the story of the\npeople involved? Isn\u2019t it the job of\nMarine Joe Townsend. Feburary 2013. Photographed by Bryan Adams Photo: Bryan Adams\nKamil McClelland explores what remains after Iraq and Afghanistan\ntheir expressions, their positioning,\nthe setting to tell this story, all the\nthings that define a photographer\u2019s\nquality and something completely\nlacking in this showcase?\nOne photo particularly stayed\nwith me, and not in a positive\nway. It did not show the brutalised\nteenager\u2019s young face, just his\nmutilated hands alongside his\nmedals. By directly equating the\ninjuries with a nationalistic pro-military stance, Adams is destroying\nany vague attempt made to try and\nhelp the viewers gain insight into\nthe lives of these veterans in any\nmeaningful way. It is pure and simple\npropaganda! And just as ever, there is\nno profundity in his works, a simple\nman\u2019s attempt to try and make\na comment on the atrocities and\naftermath of war.\nIn conclusion, yes, this exhibition\nmay show one aspect of the legacy\nof war but both artistically and in\nthe choice of subject, it does the\nwar no justice and is an insult to all\nthose affected by its terror. It hides\nas much as it reveals in what ends\nup being no more than military\npropaganda. Oh how heroic they\nwere, protecting their country! No\nquestions asked about was it worth it\nand the consequences for the people\nof Iraq and Afghanistan. What was\ntheir legacy? Surely much more\nhorrific than anything on show here\ntoday!\nFor them, the legacy of war will\nlast much longer and will have a\nmuch more devastating impact. And\ndespite the Chief of Defence Staff,\nGeneral Sir Nicholas Houghton,\nclaiming that the primary mission\nin Afghanistan has been achieved,\none has to wonder whether there\nwas really anything achieved for\nthe people on the ground. This\nexhibition makes a mockery of this\ntrue, less palatable legacy.\nWounded: The Legacy of War is on\nuntil 25th January 2015. Free Entry.\nThe exhibition is accompanied by a\nbook, published by Steidl, featuring 40\nphotographs by Bryan Adams, available\nfor \u00a340. Proceeds from the book goes\nto veteran support charities BLESMA,\nBlind Veterans UK, Combat Stress,\nSSAFA, and War Child\n\n"

The table displayed the\nnew allocations for each student on\nan annual basis, which varies on the\nincome bracket of the student\u2019s family household.\nCouncil members were quick to\nvoice outrage over the changes, with\none saying that they were essentially\n\u201cAnti-Robin Hood\u201d, due to the fact\nthat students from households with a\nlower income were getting less money\nat the cost of students from a higher\nincome getting more. Said another\nCouncil member, \u201cThese changes are\nessentially evil.\u201d\nA statement was drawn up by a\nmember of Council after the paper\nwas discussed, that was then read\nout towards the end of the meeting\nso as to be included officially in the\nminutes. The statement read that\n\u201cThe Imperial College Union Council\nwould like to condemn in the strongest possible terms the Provost Board\u2019s\nalterations to the bursary structure.\n\u201cWe feel the College has not consulted extensively enough on this\ndecision and that it does not reflect\nthe needs of low and middle income\nstudents.\n\u201cWe are particularly concerned\nwith the large decrease in support\nat the \u00a350k boundary and decrease\nfor the poorest students in the under\n\u00a330k category.\n\u201cWe call on them to revisit this\nissue as soon as possible with a full\nand extensive consultation that fully\ntakes into account all students\u2019 views\nand needs, and to provide full details\nof the reasons for any changes made.\u201d\nAll members of the Union Council\npassed the statement unanimously.\nThe Provost Board has decided\nto reduce the bursary allocation by\n\u00a31,000 for students from a household of an income of less than \u00a316k,\nmeaning they will now receive \u00a35,000\na year. Those from a household with\nan income of \u00a316 to \u00a325k have seen\nan annual reduction of \u00a32,000, with\nthe Provost Board deciding to allocate\n\u00a34,000 instead of the previous \u00a36,000\nthey receive.\nMeanwhile, those students coming\nfrom households with an income\nabove \u00a335k will have seen an increase\nin the bursaries they receive. Students\nfrom a household of \u00a335k to \u00a342k\npreciously received \u00a31,200 a year, but\nnow will also be looking to receive\n\u00a34,000 from now on.\nAt the top of the bracket, students\nfrom a household with an income of\n\u00a355k to \u00a360k will receive \u00a32,000 a\nyear, quadrupling what they previously received before the Provost\nBoard made the changes.\nTom Wheeler explained that he was\ngiven a very short window in which\nto survey students about their living\ncosts, due to the Provost Board keen\nto make a decision in time for a print\ndeadline of next year\u2019s prospectus.\nWheeler ran a forum for students\nto talk to him in person about their\nbursaries, and, after turnout was low,\nran an online survey open to all those\nthat receive bursaries from the College. He received over 300 responses,\nwhich he used to make recommendations to the Provost Board.\nHowever, none of these were\nreflected exactly in the final figures\ndecided upon by the Provost board,\nalthough they did use the survey\nresults to finalise their own figures.\nTom Wheeler said in the meeting\nthat Council citing its displeasure at\nthe figures was unlikely to influence\na change in the figures in the near\nfuture.\nIn a quote to Felix, Tom Wheeler\nsaid: \u201cTo ensure student input on the\nchanges to the distribution of the\nCollege Bursary, I carried out an Open\nForum meeting, as well as an online\nsurvey to discuss these changes. The\nAn artist's impression of the fridges in Wilkinson Hall after the Provost\nBoard's ruling.
