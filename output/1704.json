    "content": "Mamma Mia! Stories of motherhood\nW\ne begin\nStories with\nwhat might\neasily be\na first date. Felix (Sam\nTroughton), an art col-lector, has invited Anna\n(Claudia Blakley) to his\nflat. He\u2019s bought flowers\nand babbles about the\nnewest watercolours he\u2019s\nacquired with cringe-in-ducing nervousness. Anna\nhaltingly tries to make\nsmall talk in an attempt to\npierce the oppressive rind\nof awkward tension that\u2019s\ngrowing between the two.\nIt\u2019s clear both of them are\ndesperate just to get on\nwith it. Felix shows Anna\nto the bedroom, but he\nwon\u2019t be joining her \u2013 he\u2019s\nheaded to the bathroom\nwith porn loaded on his\nphone. Wait, what? We\nquickly learn that this is\nno ordinary date: Anna\nintends to get pregnant\nbefore the evening is up,\nFelix is her sperm donor.\nAs Felix heads off\nstage into the bathroom,\nand Anna to the bedroom,\nplaywright and director\nNina Raine\u2019s hilarious,\nheartbreaking play\nunfurls, plunging us\ninto the circumstances\nthat have led its heroine\nto this moment. We\nlearn that newly-single\nAnna, pushing forty, has\nembarked on a quest in\nwhich she will do practically anything to become\na mother.\nAs the play goes on\nand Anna\u2019s chances of\nbecoming a mother seem\never slimmer, a lesser\nplaywright might\u2019ve let\nthe script sag into maudlin\nself-pity. Instead, Raine\noffers a fine balance of\ntears and laughter; no\nother play has made me\nlaugh out loud as hard or\nas often.\nIn the intimate setting\nof the Dorfman\u2019s stripped\ndown stage, Blakley and\nTroughton take Raine\u2019s\nincisive, wonderfully naturalistic dialogue and run\nwith it. Troughton is each\nof the characters inAnna\u2019s\nrevolving cast of potential\nbaby-daddies: exes,\ncolleagues, fantastically\negotistical theatre direc-tors. Game for anything\nand armed with enviable\ncomedic chops, he is\nwinning in all his incar-nations. Blakley\u2019s Anna\nis a charming, complex,\nsometimes not altogether\nsympathetic woman. She\nis yearning, but also,\nthrillingly, a little ruthless.\nIt is a tremendous, vulnerable performance.\nBeyond a straightforward tale of one woman\u2019s\nstruggle to conceive,\nRaine\u2019s wonderfully\nincisive creation seeks to\ninterrogate the stories we\ntell ourselves about our\nown lives. Where do these\nconceptions about how\nour life will turn out come\nfrom? To what lengths\nwill we go to live the life\nwe planned for ourselves?\nWho are we willing to\nhurt in the process? In\ndoing so she includes\na thoughtful aside on\nthe ethics of conceiving\nwith anonymous sperm\ndonors.\nThis gifted cast and\nplaywright have crafted\na smart, poignant take on\nfemale agency, and the\ndifficult choices facing\nmany women today.\nVideogames: Design/ Play/ Disrupt\nO\nften dismissed\nas an idle\np a s t i m e ,\nv i d e o g a m e s\nhave a bad rep. It is thus\nexciting that the V&A has\ndedicated three halls to its\nlarge feature exhibition\nVideogames: Design/\nPlay/Disrupt. This is a\nwide-ranging exhibition\nlooking at videogames\nas a creative form, a\nsociopolitical tool, and a\ncollaborative activity.\nThe videogames of\ntoday have come a long\nway since Tetris or Pong.\nTechnological advancement has allowed the\nincorporation of ever\nmore elaborate art, strategies and concepts into\ngames. The first room,\nDesign, explores the\ncreative process of game\ndesigners, and the interesting concepts that are\nemerging in new games.\nGoing against the idea\nthat videogames make\none antisocial, Journey\naims to encourage collaboration and empathy.\nPlayers go on a journey\nacross undulating landscapes before climbing\na mountain and reaching\nthe summit. There is an\nemotions chart on display,\nwhere designers have\nused different colours and\nmotifs to chart the emotional journey a player\nmakes as they progress\nin the game. The graphics\nare beautiful, and the play\ninteresting in its focus on\natmosphere rather than\nplot or strategy.\nThe exhibition showcases the immense effort\nand great detail that go\ninto game design. In developing survival adventure game The Last of Us,\nactors wore a suit studded\nwith motion sensors in\norder to model the movements of protagonist Ellie\nrealistically in the game.\nArtificial intelligence was\nemployed to model the\nvariety of Ellie\u2019s responses to Joel (the player\u2019s\nrole), depending on what\nthe player does. From\nintricate environmental\nstudies to detailed character modelling, many of\nthese games are complex\nworks of art.\nThe second room,\nDisrupt, explores how\nvideogames have been\npolitical. Just like films or\nbooks, games have been\ncensored. Phone Story\nis a commentary on exploitative manufacturing\npractices of the mobile\nphone industry, and was\nremoved from Apple\u2019s\napp store. A Series of\nGunshots is a disturbing\ngame where whenever\nthe player hits the button,\na random window lights\nup in the building on\nthe screen, signifying a\ngunshot and a victim.\nBecause videogames\nare participatory, such a\nresponse can be elicited to\ncriticize the ambivalence\nshown towards gunshots\nin the community, as long\nas it does not hit ourselves.\nMen are more associated with videogames\nthan women, and within\ngames, sexism is rife.\nFemale characters are\noften romantic or sexual\ninterests, dressed suggestively and not very clever.\nAnita Sarkeesian explores\nthis on her YouTube series\nTrope Vs Women, which\nis shown here. The variety\nof games in this room and\ntheir myriad issues raised\nis truly illuminating.\nIn the final room, one\nis treated to a huge screen\nwhich show short clips\nthat represent the gaming\ncommunity, such as Minecraft players coming\ntogether to recreate their\ngame in real life. Do\nnot make the mistake of\nspending too much time\nin the first two rooms,\ninteresting as they are \u2013 it\nis in the final room where\nthe quirky arcade games\nare, along with creative\nnew party games.\nVideogames is an impressive and thoroughly\nenjoyable snapshot of the\nvideogames industry and\ncommunity today, and\nis a must-see for anyone\ninterested in art, graphic\ndesign, and, of course,\nvideogames.\nClaudia Blakley as Anna // Sarah Lee\nARTS\nFRIDAY, 9TH\nNOVEMBER, 2018 FELIX\n26\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nClaudie Blakley delivers laughs and tears in equal measure in Nina Raine\u2019s new play.\nARTS\nWhere?

Sat\nbetween a Byron burgers\nand the peacocks of\nHolland park, it became\nthe 7th British museum to\ndo so in the 41 years that\nthe prize has been given\nout.\nJust a few months\nlater the museum came\nunder scrutiny for\nhosting an event for\nthe Italian aerospace\nand defence industry\ngiant Leonardo. This\nculminated in a third of\nthe works being pulled\nfrom the exhibition\nHope to Nope, which\nwas taking place in the\nmuseum at the time.\nThe exhibition was\nshowcasing political\nposters from the past ten\nyears, and many of the\nartists felt that the spirit\nof their work, much of\nwhich was supporting\npeace and denouncing\nweapons manufacturing,\nwas being completely\ntrampled on by the\nmuseum\u2019s actions. The\nsituation ended with\nthe museum waiving\nthe entry fee for the\nremaining duration of\nthe exhibition.\nIt seems like being\nout of touch is becoming\na theme for the museum,\nthough, as I was able\nto experience first hand\nlast weekend at the\nBeazley designs of the\nyear exhibition. The\nexhibition offers many\nexquisite designs, and\nis quite the inspirational\nway to spend an\nafternoon. It starts off\nwith designs promoting\ne n v i r o n m e n t a l\nsustainability, and then\nweaves its way through\nmany different areas\nof design, from fancy\nclothes and glow-in-the-dark plants to the\nhyperloop. The message\nthat I felt the museum\nwas trying to push was\none of progressive\ndesign. All the proper\nbuzzwords were there,\nand some of the most\ndaring designs truly\nwere boundary-pushing\nand promised to benefit\nsociety. In the fashion\nsection, there were\nclothes from a Spanish\nfashion designer\nwho made an entire\ncollection for men using\ntraditionally female\nelements, as well as a\nfashion line that was\ncompletely unisex. Both\npieces told a story of\nblurring lines between\nthe genders, and how\na more fluid fashion\nlandscape might help\nwith gender-related\ndiscrimination.\nA few metres on was\na display case featuring\ncare packages from\nChoose Love, a website\nallowing people to buy\nresources for refugees,\nhoping that an approach\nwhere a donation results\nin a tangible object\nbeing given directly to\na refugee will spur on\nmore people to donate.\nImagine my surprise\nwhen I saw, right next to\nthe Choose Love display\ncase, displays showing\noff the Qatari national\nlibrary and the Abu\nDhabi Louvre. Both of\nLGBT+ community and\nwomen in the Emirates\nand Qatar is widely\nknown, but there is a\nmuch larger problem\nwith featuring their\ndesigns. Both of these\nprojects were reported\nto be built on modern\nslave labour, including\nreports by Amnesty\nInternational and\nHuman Rights Watch. It\nis also extremely ironic\nthat the main sponsor\nof the exhibition,\nBeazley insurance, has\na disclaimer about not\nsupporting slave labour\nat the bottom of their\nwebsite.\nI don\u2019t know whether\nthe solution is to remove\nthese designs from the\nexhibition. But showing\noff a pretty time-lapse\nof the construction of\nthe Louvre does not\ntell the whole story.\nPerhaps someone can\nmake it an art project\nto superimpose a death\ncount of mistreated\nmigrant workers,\nwith their passports\nconfiscated and their\nlives in disarray, onto\nthe video, and send that\nto the design museum.\nThe design museum // Wikimedia\n\u201cShowing a\npretty time-lapse of the\nconstruction\nof the Abu\nDhabi Louvre\ndoes not tell\nthe whole\nstory.\u201d\nthese are fundamentally\nat odds with the\naforementioned designs.\nThe institutionalised\noppression of the\nDISAGREE WITH AN OPINION?

And that\u2019s what\u2019s led\nher here, to the start of a\n26-mile marathon, despite\nnever having run even\nhalf that distance.\nThis is the premise\nof It\u2019s Not A Sprint:\na clever metaphor of\na woman forced to\nconfront everything in\nlife she\u2019s been running\naway from through a\nmarathon she randomly\nchooses to commit to.\nIt\u2019s a one-woman show,\nwith writer and actress\nGrace Chapman alone on\nstage, accompanied by the\nvoice of an off-stage actor\nplaying what can only be\ndescribed as Maddie\u2019s\ninner voice. It initially\nseems like a cheap\ngimmick, but their chemistry is such that it works.\nThe play explores several\nthreads to Maddie\u2019s life.\nAs the marathon marks\na crisis brought on by\nher 30th birthday, it goes\nwithout saying that age\nfeatures heavily in all of\nher thoughts. Foremost\nis her relationship with\nlong-term boyfriend, Phil.\nThey\u2019ve been together for\n5 years and Phil wants\nto take the next step, but\nMaddie isn\u2019t sure what\nher answer is. Maddie\u2019s\nthoughts about Phil are\nlinked inextricably to her\nfertility \u2013 she\u2019s certainly\nnot in a rush to have kids,\nbut soon realises that her\nbiological clock is ticking.\nThe moments where\nMaddie works against\nher anxiety about this,\nforcing herself to bring\nthe thought of children\ncloser and closer to the\npresent, are amongst the\nbest of the show.\nThe premise of It\u2019s\nNot a Sprint is definitely\na good one, but the story\nand script let it down.\nDespite being the main\ntopic of Maddie\u2019s worries\nwe find out little about\nPhil, and not a great deal\nabout their relationship.\nHalfway through it is\nrevealed Maddie is having\nan affair. It\u2019s clear the\nlate reveal is intended for\ndramatic effect, but it ends\nup coming off shallow and\nunfeeling. Why should\nwe care about this affair\nif even Maddie doesn\u2019t\nseem too focused on it?\nThe staging is effective,\nbut that\u2019s about it. It\u2019s\nsimple and it supports\nthe premise, there isn\u2019t\nanything that particularly\nadds to the performance,\nbut certainly nothing that\ntakes away from it. Grace\nChapman is a strong\nperformer; she\u2019s funny\nand relatable as Maddie\nand has the strength to\ncarry the solo show on her\nshoulders, managing to\nconvey a restless energy\nthat makes Maddie\u2019s\nmarathon feel all too real.\nIn the end It\u2019s Not A\nSprint is serviceable; it\u2019s\na decent hour\u2019s entertain-ment, but sadly nothing\nmore. Chapman is fun to\nwatch and the premise is\ninteresting, but when you\ndig deeper, there\u2019s nothing\nhere that\u2019s particularly\ninsightful or memorable.\nI\nnspired by the story of\nWilliam Freeman, the\nfirst man in America\nto plead insanity in\ncourt, Freeman explores\nthe ways in which systemic racism and attitudes to\nmental health have been\nintertwined throughout\nhistory. This collaboration\nbetween writer Camilla\nWhitehill and theatre\ncompany Strictly Arts\nhones in on this somewhat\nneglected link in history,\nusing six different stories\nspanning several centuries\nto shine a light on the\nissue.\nCentral to the play\nis Freeman, a young\nblack man wrongfully\nimprisoned in the 1800s\nand subjected to extreme\nviolence in prison, who\nlater goes on to kill four\npeople. Despite a plea\nof insanity due to severe\nbrain damage, Freeman\nwas found guilty and\nsentenced to death. Other\nstoriesarepainfullyrecent,\nincluding that of Sandra\nBland, found hanged in\nher cell in 2015 following\nan arrest for a traffic\noffence. On the surface\nthese cases are worlds\napart, but dig deeper and\nwe find systemic racism\nand mental health issues\nat play in both cases. We\njump between stories,\ngaining urgency as the\nplay progresses and we\nmove forward in time.\nDirector Daniele Stevenson is a master of pacing,\ntransitioning between\nstories in a way that builds\nin intensity.\nTo say the cast are\nfantastic would be a gross\nunderstatement.

    "content": "Detective Inspector Dog \u2013 Mission: Malaria\nRecent research from Durham University has identified a promising new method of malarial detection, that may\nassist or even replace current laboratory methods \u2013 sniffer dogs.\nSCIENCE\nPhotini Knoyle\nScience Writer\n\u201cThe dogs had\n70% accuracy\nidentifying\ninfected\nindividuals\nand 90%\naccuracy for\nuninfected\nones\u201d\nD\nogs are often\nconsidered to\nbe man\u2019s best\nfriend. This\nrelationship has persisted\nfor millennia, with our\ncanine pals taking roles\nsuch as bomb detection\nagents, sheep herders,\nnannies and of course,\ncompanions. The role\nof dogs in global health\nincludes the early detection of many human\ndiseases, such as cancers\nand Parkinson\u2019s disease.\nResearchers from Durham\nUniversity have demonstrated that we may soon\nbe able to use trained dogs\nto detect another globally\nimportant disease \u2013 ma-laria, which has important\nimplications for the future\ntreatment and survival of\ninfected individuals.\nPeople infected with\nmalaria produce a distinct\nscent. The researchers set\nout to test whether dogs,\nwith their incredibly sensitive noses, can smell this\nand therefore diagnose\ninfected individuals. This\nstudy was undertaken\non a sample of school\nchildren in The Gambia\n\u2013 an endemic region for\nmalaria. The children\ngave blood samples for\nlaboratory detection and\nprovided socks they had\nworn overnight for scent\ndetection by trained\nsniffer dogs. Compared\nto laboratory detection,\nwhich is considered 100%\naccurate, the dogs had\n70% accuracy identifying\nindividuals with the infection and 90% accuracy\nidentifying those without.\nFor a preliminary,\n\u201cproof of concept\u201d study\nthis level of accuracy is\nvery exciting, particularly\nas the dogs were capable\nof identifying malaria\nmuch faster and more cost\neffectively than laboratory detection methods.\nHowever, the researchers\nnote that more studies are\nrequired for us to better\nappreciate the extent to\nwhich sniffer dogs can\nbe used for diagnosing\nthis disease. Future work\nwill involve expanding\nthe sampling effort\nbeyond The Gambia to\nother endemic regions.\nThese studies will also\ninclude training the dogs\nto identify the multiple\nstages of malarial infection \u2013 each of which\nproduces a different scent\nintheinfectedperson.This\nis a factor that could have\nled to an underestimation\nof the dog\u2019s accuracy in\nthis study.\nThe researchers believe\nthat with more training\nand more samples, the\ndogs could reach an\naccuracy equal to current\nlaboratory methods. Laboratory detection requires\nblood collection and in-lab\nblood screening, using\nsniffer dogs is a faster\nand non-invasive method.\nThe dogs were capable of\ndetecting malaria rapidly,\neven at very low levels\nof infection. This is necessary for early detection\nand treatment which\ngreatly improves survival\nodds and decreases transmission risk.\nMalaria is indisputably\none of the greatest killers\nof our time. Nearly half of\ntoday\u2019s human population\nis at risk of infection,\nand of the hundreds of\nthousands of people that\ndie from the disease\neach year, the majority\nare children under the\nage of five. However,\nour progress in the\nfight against the disease\nhas recently suffered a\nsetback, with the number\nof malarial infections and\ndeaths on the rise for the\nfirst time in many years\n\u2013 potentially due to drug\nresistant strains. That said,\nthe Durham study shows\npromise in the continued\nfight and may prove to\nbe a critical tool in the\nelimination and eradication of malaria in all its\nremaining strongholds.\nWatch this space.\nSniffing socks and world health: all in a day\u2019s work for\ntrained dogs, who have been shown to detect malarial\ninfection from sniffing worn socks! // Photini Knoyle\nSCIENCE\nFRIDAY, 9TH\nNOVEMBER, 2018 FELIX\nscience.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n13\nFear is in the Air\nSCIENCE\nPaula Rowi\u0144ska\nScience Writer\nH\now old should\none be to watch\nHarry Potter?\nWhat about\nThe Hunger Games?

So far,\nage ratings for movies\ndepended on subjective\nopinions.\nHowever, researchers at\nthe Max Planck Institute\nfor Chemistry in Mainz\nsuggested that we could\nbase the age classification\non the isoprene concentration in the air inside\ncinemas.\nScientists used ventilation systems in cinemas\nto measure the air\ncomposition during 135\nscreenings of 11 movies.\nThey analysed relations\nbetween the current age\nrating of a given film and\nconcentrations of 60 com-pounds. One pheromone\nstood out: the level of\nisoprene highly correlated\nwith the age classification\ndetermined by the Voluntary Self Regulation of\nthe Movie Industry. This\nmeans that the higher the\nsuggested minimal age for\na given movie, the more\nisoprene the audience\nreleases.\nScary movie scenes\nprovoke involuntary\nmovements.

The villain \u2018Jason\nVolta\u2019 played by Jake\nLacy is both written and\nperformed abysmally. A\nmoment where he punches\nthe ceiling of his car in\nfrustration might actually\nbe the worst acting I\u2019ve\never seen in theatres. His\nintroduction is effectively\na TED Talk wherein he\nbabbles complete technical gibberish before\nthe film cuts away to the\nprime minister assuring\nyou he definitely is a tech\ngenius billionaire.

The\nproduction quality here is\namateur at best.\nBut it gets worse. Very\nminor spoilers ahead, but\ntrust me, you shouldn\u2019t\ncare. Let\u2019s start with the\nproduct placement.

It feels\nlike there were some\nvery hasty changes made\nduring production, in fact\nI wouldn\u2019t be surprised\nif the originally planned\nthird act was scrapped in\nfavour of a much cheaper\nalternative. At the start,\nJohnny is shown working\nas an English teacher\nwhile secretly training\nhis students in espionage.\nThe film is screaming\n\u201cthese kids will help save\nthe day\u201d at the top of its\nlungs. The conclusion of\nthe second act would so\nperfectly transition to his\ndefeated return to school\nthat I was genuinely\nstunned when the very\nnext scene squanders all\nthat build-up so anticli-mactically.\nI\u2019m fairly certain\nAtkinson and Thompson\nwere never on set together,\nJohnny English doing his thing // IMDb\n\u201cIt feels like\nthere were\nsome very\nhasty changes\nmade during\nproduction\u201d\nscenes they share never\nactually show them in the\nsame shot. If you told me\nshe was brought in for\nsome last minute additions in order to establish\nthat replacement third act,\nI\u2019d believe it, and it would\nexplain her complete\napathy during the rest\nof the film. It was also\nheavily telegraphed that\nJohnny might find love\nin and settle down with\nOphelia, but of course\nthis never pays off either.\nThey don\u2019t even get as\nmuch as a goodbye. There\nhad to have been some\nheavy handed rewrites\nbecause I refuse to believe\nRowan Atkinson would\ncome back for this script.\nLook, this film is\ninfuriating. I wanted to\nlove it, I was so on board\nwhen I sat down in the\ntheatre that had it been\neven mediocre I probably\nwould have raved about it.\nBut it\u2019s just bad.

    "content": "ISSUE 1704\nFELIX\n27\nARTS arts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nA night at the opera \u2013 It\u2019s all Chinese to me!\nW\nhile most\nwould consider opera\na strictly\nEuropean affair, the China\nNational Peking Opera\nCompany would disagree.\nFounded in 1955, this\ncompany is one of the\nstate-funded national institutions for performing\narts. Peking opera is a\nChinese form of performing arts, developed\nfrom multiple regional\nstyles in the 19th century\nand still very relevant\ntoday. It seamlessly integrates singing, speaking,\ndance-acting and combat\ninto a single finished piece\nof art. Although this idea\nseems very foreign in the\nwest, London\u2019s Sadler\u2019s\nTheatre saw a performance of The Emperor\nand the Concubine which,\nas well as being entertain-ing, educated many on\nwhat Peking opera really\nis.\nSet during the Tang\nDynasty, the opera tells\nthe story of emperor Tang\nMing Huan (portrayed\nby Yu Kuizhi) falling\nin love with Taoist nun,\nYang Yuhuan (portrayed\nby Li Shengsu). The plot\nexplores universal themes\nof love, power, and class\nas the two lovers struggle\nwith the pressure of the\nImperial palace. Infatuated with each other, affairs\nof state take a back seat,\nrebels rise up and drama\nensues.\nAs the opera starts, a\ndelicate tune resonates\nfrom the small ensemble\nof performers to the left\nof the stage, playing a mix\nof Western and Chinese\ninstruments. Eventually,\nthe curtains do not go\nup; instead, a single actor\nenters onstage. Despite the\nlanguage barrier (although\nthe entire performance\nhad subtitles displayed on\nscreens in the theatre) it is\nabundantly clear that this\nis a comedic character.\nThis character, Gao Lishi,\nrepresents the \u2018Chou\u2019 or\nclown character, one of\nthe four classic characters\nof the Peking opera style.\nActors usually specialise\nin one type of role and\ntrain from a very young\nage to perfect every\naspect of it. In this case,\nthe performance was spot\non \u2013 the mannerisms, tone\nand general attitude were\nclearly comedic.\nWhen the curtain finally\nrises, the full effect of the\nPeking opera style can\nbe felt. There are women\nwearing intricate dresses,\nmen with large swords in\ncombat reading positions,\nall set against a beautiful\nset design depicting the\nImperial Palace. As the\nperformance got into full\nswing, the rising excitement in the theatre was\npalpable.\nAstylistic choice which\nmust be characteristic of\nChinese opera was that all\nthe actors stood extremely\nstill unless they were part\nof the action. Even then,\nthey would move very\nquickly yet elegantly, as\nthough their movements\nserved only to illustrate\nthe snapshots of the\nscenes being played out.\nLi, the seasoned actress\nplaying Yuhuan, hardly\nmoved her mouth when\nsinging and would move\nher feet very fast when\ngliding across the floor,\ngiving the illusion that she\nwas floating. Although\nstrange at first, this style\nworked well to emphasize\nthe power structure in the\nChinese court.\nThe first act ends with\nthe death of Yuhuan, and\nafter a 30 minute interval,\nthe action started up again.\nOne of the beauties of the\nfirst act was the precision\nin the choreography. The\nplacement and movement\nof characters on stage was\norderly. Symmetry was\nconserved in every scene.\nHowever, in the second\nhalf, this symmetry starts\nto break down, mirroring\nthe chaos in the plot. The\ndeath of a character in\nthe second act was one\nof the standout moments\nof the whole show. The\ningeniously elegant presentation of what is usually\nquite a dark subject was\ndone by draping a scarf\nfrom the actor\u2019s neck\nacross the entire stage.\nNever has self-sacrifice\nseemed so chic!\nOverall, the first act\nseemed rather empty,\nespecially compared\nto the second act. With\nnumerous intricate martial\nart scenes as well as set\ndesigns and choreography which painted the\nmost beautiful pictures,\nthe second act made the\nwhole experience worth-while.\nThe Emperor and the\nConcubine was only\nperformed in London\ntwice this October, but\nwill surely return to the\nUK soon \u2013 this being the\nfourth year the Peking\nOpera Company has\nperformed at Sadler\u2019s\nWells. Although opera\nis not everyone\u2019s cup of\ntea, it goes without saying\nthat this is different.\nDespite having \u201copera\u201d\nin its name, Peking\nopera is so different and\ngives audiences so much\nmore. Not only do the\nsplendid costumes and ac-tion-packed scenes make\nit a feast for the eyes, the\nunique experience gives a\nrare glimpse into Chinese\nculture and history.\nThe Monkey King and The Crossroads Inn\nT\nhe Crossroads\nInn, a classic of\nPeking opera,\nbegins with Jiao\nZan, an unjustly exiled\ngeneral, being led onstage\nin handcuffs by two\nsoldiers. By the end of\nthe scene, the handcuffs\nare on one of the soldiers\nand Jiao Zan (played by\nLiu Kuikui) is bossing\nthe other around \u2013 the\naudience is in stitches.\nBut the real stars of the\nshow are Ren Tanghui\n(Wang Haoqiang), a\nwarrior loyal to the\ngeneral, and Liu Lihua\n(Liu Bo), the owner of the\nCrossroads Inn where Jiao\nZan and the two hapless\nsoldiers have lodged for\nthe night. Not knowing\nthey are on the same side,\nRen and Liu are instantly\nsuspicious of each other.\nWhat ensues is one of the\nmost well-known scenes\nin Peking opera: the \u2018fight\nin the dark\u2019 between\nRen and Liu. On a fully\nillumined stage, it is up to\nthe two actors to convey\nthe idea of \u2018darkness\u2019\nthrough their gestures\nand mannerisms. Timing\nis everything here: as Liu\nreaches out, Ren moves\njust beyond his grasp; Ren\nswings his sword, and Liu\nbends over at just the right\nmoment to avoid being\nsliced in half. It is an\nelaborate choreography\nof missed opportunities\nwhich goes on until Jiao\nZan himself bursts in \u2013 a\nwell-placed kick from\nLiu sends him sprawling\nas well! A masterpiece of\nacrobatic feats disguised\nas slapstick comedy. Liu\nBo was particularly impressive in his acrobatics,\nwith so many front flips\nand somersaults that it\nwas hard to keep track of\nwhere he was.\nAs is typical of Chinese\nopera, each character is a\nhighly stylised caricature\nof what they represent\n\u2013 the brave warrior, the\ndown-to-earth innkeeper,\nthe imposing general. The\nanimated, stereotyped\nmovements of the actors,\ntogether with the dramatic\nfacepaint for each charac-ter, make it immediately\napparent what their roles\nare in the short comedic\nsketch. I hardly needed\nto glance at the translated\nsurtitles.\nThe second play is\njust as action-packed as\nthe first. Drawn from\nthe popular folk legend\nof the Monkey King, it\ntells the story of how the\nMonkey King and his\ncompanion Zhu Bajie\nrescue the daughter of a\nwealthy merchant and her\nmaid from the clutches of\na leopard spirit \u2013 by disguising themselves as the\ntwo ladies! Here the full\nregalia of Chinese opera is\nshowcased, with fantastically elaborate costumes,\ngilded headdresses and\nyards of flowing fabric.\nThe falsetto singing of\nthe actors is also shown\noff, accompanied by the\nrhythmic cadence of traditional Chinese percussion\nand woodwind such as\nthe suona. Multiple fight\nscenes provide ample\nopportunity for the actors\nto show off their prowess\nin martial arts. We have\na truly jaw-dropping\nsequence of spinning leaps\nfrom Liu Lie, who plays\nthe Leopard, and syn-chronised spear-throwing\ntricks from his troupe of\nfollowers. Ma Yanchao\nalso makes for an agile\nMonkey King, rivalling\nLiu in displays of acrobatic dexterity.\nAll in all, a top-notch\nperformance from the\nChina National Peking\nOpera Company, and\na vastly entertaining\ncultural experience not to\nbe missed!\nARTS\nEamon Akil Farhat\nArts Writer\nWhere?

The war was big and\naffected many, and shortly\nafter, people began using\nred poppies as symbols\nof remembrance. It was\na way of honouring the\nmen lost as well as reinforcing the idea that war\ncould never happen again.\nUnfortunately, World War\nI was not the war to end\nall wars as many more\ntook place. For some\nof these wars, such as\nWorld War II, the public\nknew that fighting was\nnecessary to overcome\nevil ideology. For others,\nhowever, such as the Iraq\nand Afghanistan wars, the\nreasons for why fighting\nwas necessary were more\nuncertain.\nWhether it be on the\ntube, in the shops, or\nturning on the TV, the\nred symbol seems to be\neverywhere, and incidentally lots of money\nhas found their way into\nthe coffers of the British\nLegion. This charity\n\u201cworks to ensure that\nthe people of the United\nKingdom remember all\nthose who have lost their\nlives on active service to\nthe Crown, and honours\nthe service of the Armed\nForces and veterans,\nand the contribution\nof their families \u2013 our\nbeneficiary community.\u201d\nThis statement begs three\nquestions. Firstly, why\ndoes the British Legion,\nand thereby the red poppy,\nonlycommemorateBritish\nservicemen and women?\nSurely in a multicultural\nsociety, we should not\ndifferentiate a man from\nBirmingham who has lost\nhis life in battle to a man\nfrom Barcelona doing the\nsame thing. Secondly, war\nin the present day kills\nmany more civilians than\nit does members of the\narmed forces. Why does a\nsoldier from Birmingham\nkilled in battle deserve\nmore commemoration\nthan a young girl from\nBaghdad who suffered\nthe same fate? Finally,\nwhy does the British\nLegion not denounce war\nor have even the slightest\nnotion of peace in their\nstatement? The answers\nto these questions are\nsimple: nationalism, pride\nand politics.\nRecent events have\ncaused, and been caused\nby, a rise in toxic nationalism where people are\nlead to believe that Britain\nis the most important\ncountry, that Britain must\ncome first. The poppy has\ncome to be a badge of this\nnationalism, and those\nwho don\u2019t wear it, for\nwhatever reason, are seen\nto be insulting British\nvalues. As every public\nfigure pins this symbol\nof Britishness onto their\nclothes in fear of angering\nthe public, some take\nthe brave step and leave\nout the poppy from their\npublic appearances.\nThis year, Manchester\nUnited player Nemanja\nMatic refused to wear\nthe poppy on his chest\nduring a match against\nBournemouth. Many were\nenraged by his disrespect\nof fallen servicemen; the\nplayer believes that the\nBritish bombs dropped on\nhis village in Serbia as a\nchild pose a much greater\ndisrespect.\nThis current climate of\n\u201cpoppy fascism\u201d, a term\ncoined by journalist Jon\nSnow, who refuses to\nwear a poppy on air, must\nstop. The expectation\nthat everyone must wear\na poppy waters down the\nwhole idea of remem-brance. What was once a\nperiod of reflection which\nmeant something different\nto each person has been\nhijacked and politicized\ninto an attempt to promote\nthe British armed forces as\na whole. Some politicians\nsuch as conservative MP\nMaria Caulfield will call\nout others for not wearing\ning them onto a charity.\nHowever, when considering how the symbol of the\nred poppy has changed,\nmany do not feel comfortable with it: this is where\nthe white poppy comes\nin. Finding its beginnings\nin the 1930s, when militaristic rhetoric started to\nrise up again in Britain,\nthis symbol promotes\npeace. The Peace Pledge\nUnion (PPU) which\nruns the campaign states\nthat: \u201cThere are three\nelements to the meaning\nof white poppies: they\nrepresent remembrance\nfor all victims of war, a\ncommitment to peace and\na challenge to attempts\nto glamorise or celebrate\nwar.\u201d This seems a much\nmore compassionate\napproach to remembrance\nand more comprehensively represents the views\nof our modern society.\nThis campaign has gained\ntraction in recent years,\nwith St Johns ambulance\nservice allowing it\u2019s employees to wear it for the\nfirst time and the National\nUnion of Teachers\npromoting it in schools.\nWhite poppies are still\nnowhere near as common\nas their red counterparts\nand many see them as\nan insult to the British\nLegions and the families\nof veterans.\nA hundred years ago\nthe Armistice was called\nand the never ending war\nended. A hundred years\nago we said never again.\nToday we must remember\nthe fallen and honour that\npledge of peace. As the\nred poppy moves further\nand further away from this\nview, for many, the white\npoppy has become the\nobvious successor.\nIn Flanders fields the poppies grow // Flickr\n\u201cFor some,\nthe poppy\nserves as a way\nto keep the\nromance of\nwar alive\u201d\nred poppies but then\nconsistently support the\nuse of UK military forces\nin combat operations\noverseas.

Meanwhile,\nthe men\u2019s teams were\nresting in 4th place for the\nA team, with the B team\n9th overall and 3rd of the\nB teams, with St Mary\u2019s\nalso leading the way for\nthe men.\nBeing in charge of\nthe course set-up for this\nrace, Imperial\u2019s helpful\nvolunteers made their way\nto the South London park\nwith all their equipment\nby taking the esteemed\nDistrict Line to Wimbledon Park and then\nthe tram to the notorious\nBeddington Lane.\nThe rest of the team\nmet as usual at Beit Quad\nat 1pm to follow the\nsame route to be there in\ntime for the 3:15pm start,\nallowing plenty of time\nfor \u201cgroup inertia\u201d on the\njourney and a sufficient\nwarm-up/toilet stop upon\narrival. Nobody managed\nto get lost en route despite\nImperial\u2019s lack of experience riding the tram, and\nthe club set up camp under\nthe shining sun ready and\nmotivated for another\nstrong race.\nAs the race was about\nto begin, the sturdy\nathletes shed their layers\nlike a snake, brought out\ntheir spikes and vests (for\nthose who had managed\nto get their hands on one\nof the limited supply or\nborrow them from one of\nseveral injured runners)\nand entered the well-re-hearsed formation for the\ntraditional team picture,\nfollowed by a late rush to\nthe start line.\nThe pace was set early\nand it was fast from the\ngun. Rapidly reaching the\nfirst set of hills, St Mary\u2019s\nmen led the race into the\nroller-coaster section as\nthe sun was shining upon\ngolden leaves, followed\nclosely by a pack of\nImperial runners, including the club\u2019s very own\ncaptain Fergus Johnson.\nAfter the race, the\nbaking bonanza took place\nas it always does, as the\nclub\u2019s \u201cBaker of the Year\u201d\naward is as coveted (if not\nmore) as a podium in the\nCross-Country league,\nfeaturing degustation of\ncroissants, cookies and\nspooky cupcakes.\nICXC put in an outstanding performance\nas the women\u2019s A team\nsmashed it: Georgia Curry\nand Kate Olding came in\n1st and 2nd in the race in\n22:31 and 23:21 respec-tively, promoting them\nto the top 2 places on the\noverall leaderboard!\nThey were followed\nclosely by Alix Vermeulen coming in 6th in\n24:18 and Lara Sterritt in\n10th place, just under 25\nminutes, meaning they\nwere the strongest team\nthat day, and now sit atop\nthe overall leaderboard\n\u2013 well on their way to\nretaining the title with 3\nfixtures remaining.\nAnna Wilson led the B\nteam home in a fabulous\n14th place. Imperial\u2019s\nladies excelled in every\nsingle way as the B and C\nteams came in 2nd in their\nrespective leagues, with\nmany of our very own\nCouch to 5K runners performing strongly, notably\nNoemie David-Rogeat\nfinishing in 35:01,\nYunping Zhang in 36:41\nand Nathalie Podder in\n45:19.\nMeanwhile, on the\nmen\u2019s side, Charlie\nMcFadzean brought it\nhome in 20th place in a\nrapid 32:48, followed by\nLucas Kreifels in 25th in\n33:31, men\u2019s captain Jack\nMcKeon in 29th in 33:51,\na wavy club captain\nFergus Johnson in 30th\nin 33:59 and Jim Warren\nin 38th in 34:48, followed\nclosely by Matt Ryan\nin 39th only a second\nbehind, and leading the B\nteam.\nOverall, the men\u2019s A\nteam maintained their\n4th place overall, still 53\npoints behind St Mary\u2019s\nB team in 3rd which\ndemonstrates SMU\u2019s\ncalibre.

His rise is another\nsymptom of the increasingly global strength of the far right.\nPOLITICS\nAvi Banerjee\nPolitics Editor\nI\nn last week\u2019s run-off\nelection, Brazil\u2019s\nfascist-in-chief Jair\nBolsonaro won the\npresidency with 55% of\nthe vote. Yes, fascist is\nthe appropriate descrip-tion, and let the record\nshow that this was a far\nfrom a fair fight. From\nthe 2016 impeachment\nof the former President\nDilma Rouseff on flimsy\ncharges of creative bookkeeping (with even those\nwho led the impeachment\nprocess admitting that\nRouseff was one of the\nleast corrupt politicians),\nthe Brazilian election\nwas nothing more than a\ncoup masquerading with\nphoney democratic legit-imacy. In fact, until two\nmonths before the elec-tion, the overwhelming\nfrontrunner was former\nPresident Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula\nda Silva, but in an unprecedented act, Brazil\u2019s top\nelectoral court, barred\nLula from participating\nin the election until the\nSupreme Court decided to\nacquit him in his appeal.\nThis move went directly\nagainst the request from\nthe UN Human Rights\nCommittee that believed\nthat if Brazil\u2019s democratic\nlegitimacy was to be pre-served, Lula should have\nbeen allowed to stand.\nLula\u2019s removal made the\nresults a foregone conclu-sion, and despite a spirited\ncampaign by Fernando\nHaddad, in the end it was\na hill too high to climb.\nSo who is the new\nBrazilian president?\nWell, Jair Bolsonaro\ncomes with a platter\ndeplorable beliefs.\nDirectly from the Trump\nplaybook, Bolsonaro has\nfuelled the xenophobic\nfears over migrants\nand refugees who in\nhis words are \u2018scum of\nthe earth. In regards to\ngender rights, he has\ntaken his lead from the\nthuggish Filipino President Rodrigo Duterte,\nand claimed he wouldn\u2019t\nrape an opposition poli-tician, Maria do Ros\u00e1rio,\nbecause \u201cshe is very\nugly\u201d. In an ironic twist,\nthe so-called \u2018law and\norder\u2019 candidate \u201cpromising to end crime\u201d has\nopenly discussed how\nhe as president would\nbreak long standing Brazilian law in employing\ntorture as a legitimate\nmeans for interroga-tion. Bolsonaro\u2019s rise\nis disappointing for a\ncountry that has come\na long way in healing\nits racial diversity, but\nracist comments like\n\u201cthey [black people]\ndon\u2019t do anything\u201d have\nstoked fears amongst\nracial minorities that the\nnew President may try to\nreturn Brazil back to its\nracist past.\nAnother area in\nwhich Brazil have made\ntremendous strides is in\nLGBT rights, with civil\nunions legalised since\n2003 and gay marriage\nsince 2013. However\nin this too Bolsonaro\nis a cultural dinosaur,\nhaving claimed that he\nwould hypotetically\nprefer his son to be dead\nrather than gay.\nBrazil has come a\nlong way since Lula first\ncame to power in 2002,\nwith over 30 million\nentering the middle\nclass. Social welfare\nschemes have reduced\nincome inequality, increased expenditure on\neducation and healthcare\nhave meant that better\nnational outcomes and\nan average 7% economic\ngrowth before the recession that has plagued\nBrazil since 2014 since\nthe fall in commodity\nprices. But the rise of\nBolsonaro, fuelled by\nthe youth which once\nwas a strong voting\nblock for the Workers\u2019\nParty, is in large part a\nreflection on how the\nWorkers\u2019 Party became\ncomplacent. Despite\nthe partisan nature of\nOperation Car Wash (the\nanti-corruption investi-gation), there has been\nundeniable graft and\ncorruption amongst all\npolitical parties. Brazil\nhave witnessed historically high crime rates\nand the worst recession\nin Brazil\u2019s history since\n2014. Like Brexit, Modi\nand Trump \u2013 Bolsonaro\u2019s\nrise can be attributed to\nthe failures of the political left. Bolsonaro\u2019s\nwin follows a trend of\npopulist extreme right\nwingers winning historic\nraces. The young people\nthat propelled Bolsonaro\nto power did not support\nhim because of his\nracism, but despite it.\nCorruption was Bolsonaro\u2019s winning message.\nThere will be far\nreaching consequences\nof this election result, not\nleast environmental deg-rapidly increase Brazil\u2019s\ndeforestation rate. If the\nrecent IPCC report is to\nbe believed, the fate of\nthe world is at state, and\nBrazil is at the forefront\nof the climate struggle.\nBrazil has been in\nthis road before. Bolsonaro has praised the\nbrutal dictatorship that\nruled the country from\n1964 to 1985, and has\nopenly said \u201c[he is] in\nfavour of a dictatorship.\u201d And we should\nbelieve that he means\nwhat he says. Already\nthe President-elect has\nmade a mockery of the\nindependence of the\njudiciary by appointing\nthe judge Sergio Moro\n(who had convicted\nLula) as the new Justice\nMinister. Bolsonaro has\nnot even taken is oath\nof office, yet his goons\nhave been encouraged\nin physically attacking\nover 20 universities,\ntrying to suppress dissenting free speech.\nIn 1922, the first\never mention of Adolf\nHitler in the New York\nTimes names him as\n\u2018unselfishly patriotic\u2019 and according to\n\u2018well-informed sources\u2019\nHitler\u2019s anti-Semitism\nwas \u201cnot so genuine or\nviolent as it sounded.\u201d\nHistory has shown the\ndangers of minimizing\nthe threat posed by\nfascists. Throughout\nthe 2016 Presidential\nelection, media outlets\nwere sure that Donald\nTrump would become\nmore presidential when\nhe won the Republican\nprimary. He did not.\nThus, we cannot afford\nto underestimate the\nlikes of Bolsonaro.\nMeet the new Duce // Wikimedia\nradation and subjugation\nof tribal rights. Bolsonaro once lamented why\nthe conquistadors didn\u2019t\ncompletely exterminate\nthe indigenous people\nof the Amazon, and has\npromised that he will\nnot leave a single square\nmillimetre of protected\nreserved tribal land.\nFurthermore, despite the\nBrazillian parliament\nhaving nearly universally ratified the Paris\nClimate Accords, Bolsonaro has threated to\ntear them up. Logging,\nmining and big-agricul-ture has funnelled vast\namounts of money to\nBrazil\u2019s right wing, and\ntheir puppet has bragged\nabout how he would\n\n"

Lab coat,\nsafety goggles, notebook,\nendlesspens.Weexchange\nan understanding nod\nand I\u2019m inside \u2013 at the\nopera! Everyone we pass\nis elegantly dressed. We\nwind our way up to the\nDress Circle and enter the\nbeautiful theatre, heavily\ndecorated in intricate red\nand gold. I take my seat\nand even though it hasn\u2019t\nstarted I\u2019m already feeling\nrelaxed, enjoying the je\nne sais quoi that is the\nglamour of the opera.\nThe lights dim for\nthe third run of Director\nDavidAlden\u2019s production,\nLucia di Lammermoor at\nthe London Coliseum. I\nmust confess it felt rather\nodd to set the very Italian\nsounding Raimondo,\nNormanno and Enrico\nin nineteenth century\nScotland, but once I got\nover that the whole thing\nwas rather enjoyable.\nThe story opens with\nEnrico\u2019s plan to marry\npoor Lucia to Arturo\n\u2013 only to discover that\nshe is in love with the\nrather charismatic, kilt-clad reprobate Edgardo.\nDespite his obvious\ncharacter flaws, na\u00efve\nLucia is besotted with him\n(as are we). She appears\nvery young indeed, with\nher rag dolls and her long\nbloomers peeking out\nfrom under her skirt as\nshe tiptoes playfully along\nthe windowsill, but this\nonly makes us empathise\nwith her all the more\nas we watch her being\nmanipulated and taken\nadvantage of throughout\nthe opera. Manipulated by\nher brother into marrying\nArturo, Lucia is driven to\nmadness and eventually\nmeets a bitter end.\nDespite her obvious\nyouth, or perhaps because\nof it, I found Lucia surprisingly relatable. No,\nmy brother isn\u2019t trying to\nmarry me off to a wealthy\ncount, and no, I\u2019m not\npining for my seemingly\nunfaithful Scottish lover\ngone to France, but it felt\nas if there were something real about Lucia\u2019s\nemotional reactions to the\nimpossible situation she\nfinds herself in.\nSpecial mentions must\ngo to Eleazar Rodr\u00edguez as\nEdgardo, and Sarah Tynan\nas Lucia, who really steals\nthe show, demonstrating\nboth incredible skill and\nplayfulness in her librettos\nin the first act. The set was\nbrilliant; a Bront\u00eb-esque\nmansion designed by\nCharles Edwards, ever so\nslightly dilapidated with\nhigh windows for characters to leap in and out\nof. I also loved the use of\nchildren\u2019s toys throughout\nscenes with Lucia, which\nI felt perfectly mirrored\nthe way in which Enrico\ntreated Lucia; a plaything,\na doll, something that he\ncould control and own.\nOn my way home (via\nLeicester Square this time\nto avoid those notorious\nstairs at Covent Garden) I\nfeel quite satisfied. A trip\nto the English National\nOpera delights the senses,\ntaking you on an emotional and intellectual journey\nbut leaving you feeling\nrelaxed and luxuriated at\nthe same time. Despite the\nfanciful nature of the plot,\nI found something quite\nrelatable in the plight of\npoor Lucia, allowing me\nto experience something\nof all of her emotions;\nlove, betrayal, despair...\nIf you have never been\nto an opera, you\u2019ve got to\ngo; there\u2019s really nothing\nquite like it.\nThe Wild Duck\nThere is no warning, no\ndimming of lights when\nthe play begins; instead,\nKevin Harvey casually\nwalks on stage, mic in\nhand, and starts talking\nabout the history of The\nWild Duck, a play written\nin 1884 by the acclaimed\nNorwegian playwright\nHenrik Ibsen. It\u2019s almost\nlike a pre-theatre lecture.\nThere is truth and there are\nlies, he says, and seeking\nthe \u2018original\u2019 version of\nthe play is a lie \u2013 we\u2019ve\nlost the societal context\nof 19th century Norway\nlong ago. Then he puts\ndown the mic, slips into\nthe character of Gregory\nWoods, and the play has\nbegun before we know it.\nRobert Icke\u2019s interpretation of Ibsen\u2019s classic\nis certainly updated for\na 21st century audience.\nNames are Anglicised,\nprofessions modernised.\nH\u00e5kon Werle, the wholesale merchant, becomes\nCharles Woods, the\nwealthy investment trader.\nThere is frequent breaking\nof the fourth wall, with\nthe microphone serving\nas the switch between\nin-character dialogue and\naudience asides. This\nis subverted as the play\ngoes on and events spiral\nincreasingly out of the\ncharacters\u2019 control. \u201cEnd\nscene. END SCENE!\u201d\nGregory/Harvey bellows\ninto the mic, but just as\nGregory has lost control\nover the events in the\nplay, Harvey also loses\nthe power to direct what is\nhappening on stage.\nIt\u2019s a clever trick, but\nlike much in Icke\u2019s ren-dition, it seems too facile.\nIbsen\u2019s play is a nuanced\nexploration of truth,\nillusions, and the potentially destructive power of\nconceited idealism. With\nIcke, nuance goes out the\nwindow. The audience\ndoesn\u2019t have to guess what\nthe characters are actually\nthinking; all subtext is\nconveniently explained\nvia running comments\ninto the ever-handy mi-crophone. Of course, this\nmeans Ibsen\u2019s wonderful\ndramatic irony goes out\nthe window too \u2013 a joke\nisn\u2019t funny when you have\nto explain it.\nNowhere is the loss of\nambiguity more apparent\nthan in the ending. Will\nthe tragic events of the\nplay be a driving force\nfor James Ekdal to turn\nhis life around, or will he\nrelapse into his old weak\nways? Ibsen\u2019s original\nleaves it open, but here\nwe are told grimly that\nscarcely a year passes\nbefore James forgets the\npurity of Hedwig\u2019s sac-rifice, and that Gregory\nends up hanging himself.\nIt is all very neat and\nnicely packaged: extreme\nidealism is bad. Happy\ndelusion is better than\nharsh reality.\nDespite Icke\u2019s heavy-handed treatment, the end\nresult is still a powerful\nperformance. Much of\nthis is down to the cast \u2013\nHarvey makes a brilliant\nGregory, passionately\nmisguided in his own\nbeliefs, while Edward\nHogg excels in his role of\ntheinsecure,self-absorbed\nJames with fantasies of\nself-importance. Dramatic\ntension gradually builds\nup as the web of lies surrounding the Ekdal family\nis revealed, and by the end\nof the fourth act it hangs\nin the air like a string\nabout to snap. Clara Read\ngives a heart-wrenching\nportrayal of Hedwig, the\nyoung Ekdal daughter\nkey to much of the plot\u2019s\nintrigue. The intimate\nsetting of the Almeida\nTheatre heightens the intensity of the minimalistic\nproduction; members of\nthe cast emerge from the\nstalls and theatregoers\u2019\npossessions are borrowed\nas props in the play.\nThis Ibsen-inspired\nproduction is definitely\nstill worth a watch, but\nI\u2019d recommend viewers\nread the original play\nafter. Unlike Icke, I\u2019d\nlike to think the 21st-cen-tury audience is just as\ncapable of appreciating\nits thought-provoking\nsubtleties as the audience\nof two centuries ago.\nA tragic tale of male manipulation // John Snelling\nARTS\nHelen Money-Kyrle\nArts Editor\nWhere?

Poverty.\nThese are all\nproblems every human on\nthe face of the earth must\ndeal with, and it is something everyone should be\ntackling. The financial\nindustry has decided to\ncombat these problems\nwith Environmental,\nSocial and Governance\n(ESG) Investing. It is\ninvesting standards\nthat indicates whether\na company has strong\nethical and sustainable\npractices. Investors who\nwish to buy these stocks\nfor their portfolio do so\nthrough socially responsible mutual funds and\nexchange-traded funds.\nSome argue that this\nbreaches asset managers\u2019\nduty to focus solely\non investment returns,\nhowever, comparing the\nannualized 5-year return\non the MSCI Europe Index\nat 13.5% with the more\nsustainable MSCI Europe\nSRI Index at 14.87%,\nmany think that returns\nare actually greater.\nFurthermore, looking\nat the bigger picture,\nclimate change will\ncontinue to cost the world\neconomy more and more.\nAccording to the UN Intergovernmental Panel on\nClimate Change, extreme\nweather and the health\nimpact of burning fossil\nfuels cost the American\neconomy at least $240bn a\nyear over the past decade.\nBy 2030, the report\nestimates that the loss of\nproductivity caused by a\nhotter world could cost\nthe global economy $2trn.\nFortunately, BlackRock is\nestimating that the ESG\ninvestment market will\ngrow 16-fold, from $25bn\nto $400bn, over the next\ndecade. The difficultly\ncomes in integrating ESG\nin a standardised way\ninto financial products.\nResponsible investing is\na complex area with no\nfixed definitions, says\nDaniel Ung, head of smart\nbeta strategy for the SPDR\nfund range at State Street\nGlobal Advisors. While it\nis simple to screen tobacco\ncompanies and weapon\nmanufacturers out of the\nequation, it is harder to\nsift through stocks that\nare managing to transition\nto low-carbon economy\nwell. This filtering effect\nmay also have unexpected\nrepercussions. Charlie\nRobertson of Renaissance\nCapital, argues that ESG\ncriteria could skew capital\nflows towards the most\nprivileged parts of the\nworld, making it harder\nfor less developed countries to escape poverty\nand in turn prevent them\nfrom progressing towards\nenvironmental and social\ngovernance. Mr Robertson suggests that, instead,\ninvestors should adopt\neconomic relativism.\nInvestors should judge\na country relative to the\nGDP per person, recognising that Chile, Indonesia\nand Poland are all unusually virtuous given their\nstage of development. On\nthe other hand, it is well\nknown that foreign investment in a country can\nbe overrated as a source\nof growth. Ashley Taylor\nof the World Bank thinks\nthat emerging economies\nbenefit from foreign investment only if they pass\na certain threshold of institutional quality, which\nmany emerging markets\ndon\u2019t. Maybe if investors\nstarve these markets of\nfickle foreign capital,\nit may be a blessing in\ndisguise, forcing them to\nstand on their own two\nfeet.\nFrom bad to worse for Puma Biotechnology\nI\nf you want a good example of how volatile\nbiotechnology stocks\ncanbe,looknofurther\nthan Puma Biotechnology\nInc. This cancer-focused\nbiotechnology company\nwas founded 8 years\nago and went public in\n2012 with shares trading\naround $10 per share.\nIn 2014 that share price\nrocketed to +$260 following positive clinical trials\nfor the breast cancer drug\nNerlynx, which contributed towards the company\u2019s\nvaluation at $10 billion.\nFollowing this, mixed research results and delays\nin approval processes\nhave caused the company\nshare price to swing\nwildly with the stock price\nplummeting almost 80%\nthis year. Shares plunged\na further 48% on Friday\n2nd November after the\ncompany reported disappointing sales of $52.6\nmillionforNerlynx,below\nexpectations of $58.1\nmillion. Furthermore,\nPuma Biotech indicated\nthat the percentage of\npatients who discontinued\nthe use of Nerlynx as a\nresult of adverse events\nhad increased to about\n18%, which only added\nto the sell-off. The good\nnews for shareholders is\nthat this massive sell-off\nis probably overdone.\nNerylnx\u2019s sales are likely\nto increase as the drug\nbecomes more globally\nused, which may indicate\nthat this stock is currently\nat a bargain price.\nINVESTMENT\nTom Alston\nInvestment Editor\nICIS Editor in Chief\nINVESTMENT\nPeter Green\nICIS Co-Editor\nReturns on MSCI World and MCSI World ESG Index // MSCI\nISSUE 1704\nFELIX\nINVESTMENT icu.investmentsociety@imperial.ac.uk\nNASDAQ:PBYI //Yahoo Finance\n\u201cBy 2030... loss\nof productivty\ncaused by a\nhotter world\ncould cost\nthe global\neconomy $2\ntrn.\u201d\n\n"

Looking by Sam\nLipp presents Jackson\nwith a black and white\npalate and an almost\nblurry portrait, showing\nhim as a misty, ghost-like\nfigure. Michael was at a\nlow, and the artists rightfully took note. We can\nnever know the full truth,\nbut it is important at least\nto understand its effect on\nhim.\nFrom his incredible\nmusic, his dancing, his\nactivism and political\nplay; his skin colour, his\nISSUE 1704\nFELIX\n28\nARTS arts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nMichael Jackson: On the Wall \u2013 the glorification of a\nglorified man\nAn exhibition that encompasses the effect Michael Jackson had on the world.\nS\ntepping into the\nNational Portrait\nGallery felt like\nvisiting a world-fa-mous show: there were\nlong queues of people for\ntickets, Michael Jackson\u2019s\nvibrant music was playing\nwith dancing audiences,\nand visitors spanned all\nraces, ages, and genders.\nEven before entering the\nexhibition, there was a\nsense of Michael\u2019s impact\non the world \u2013 he passed\nalmost ten years ago, yet\nstill garnered crowds\nlarger than most exhibitions I\u2019ve seen on a Friday\nnight. This is an impact\nmost stars in history\ncannot match.\nIt cannot be missed that\nMichael was, colloquially\nspeaking, a God and an\nicon, as seen by his fans,\nbut also himself. Sculptures like the incredible\nP.Y.T. (standing for, and\nin reference to, Jackson\u2019s\ntrack \u2018Pretty Young\nThing\u2019) showcasing\nballoons tied to his loafers\npositioned in his \u2018freeze\u2019\nmove show it all. He\nbecame so synonymous\nwith a dance move that his\nimage does not need to be\nphysically there, instead\nreplaced with a beautiful\nmix of balloons, bringing\na sense of being unreacha-ble: successful and above\nit all. The mere fact that\nhe had commissioned The\nKing: Part I by Wiley,\na portrait replacing a\nNeapolitan figurehead on\na high horse with himself,\nspeaks volumes about his\nself-image. However, the\nfans and contemporary\nartists are the ones who\nput him there. Portraits\nlike Archangel Michael:\nAnd No Message Could\nHave Been Any Clearer\nby David LaChapelle\nmimic classical Christian\npaintings, where he stands\nover the defeated devil,\npalms together, with\nbeautiful, radiant white\nwings. Whether the devil\nrepresented world politics\nand war, his struggles,\nor even just bad music,\nhis ability to overcome\nthem was idealized by the\npublic.\nMuch of the artwork\nalso reflected the love\nof his fans.

King:\nPart II by Wiley is a video\nconsisting of hardcore\nfans who volunteered to\nsing and dance to Michael\nJackson songs, recorded\nand shown in galleries\nworldwide. Most sang\nwith passion (some with\nnerves!), while wearing\ntheir Michael Jackson\nmerchandise, really showcasing the depth that this\nlove may reach.\nMichael Jackson\ntackled race with both\nhis presence in the media\nand his actions. Susan\nSmith-Pinelo rightly\npoints out that the Jackson\nFive were the \u201cfirst\nwholesome black family\nto enter homes all over the\nUS\u201d, where most black\nicons had had rougher\nbackgrounds. She created\na looped film, Something,\nof a black woman\u2019s\nbreasts bouncing, with the\nwords \u201cghetto\u201d written\non a gold necklace on\nher chest, playing Jackson\u2019s \u2018Workin\u2019 day and\nnight\u2019 in the background.\nHere she indicates the\ndifficulties in overcoming stereotypes and the\nhyper-sexualisation of\nblack women, using\nMichael to do so. Seeing\nMichael achieve so much\nlet the black community\nfinally see something of\nthemselves in him, and\nas someone successful, as\nshown by Self-Portrait at\nSeven years old, a piece\nthat depicts Michael\nJackson, not the artist\nGlenn Ligon as one might\nexpect. Further, Michael\u2019s\n\u2018Thriller\u2019 tackled race in\nsuch an in-depth manner\nthat is still being analysed\nto this day as in The Other\nLook, which consisted of\nnewspaper cuttings of interpretations of the music\nvideo and how it tackles\nracism. \u2018Thriller\u2019 is one\nof the most widely known\nsongs of all time, hence its\nreach really shed light on\nthe issue of skin colour to\nmany.\nMichael Jackson even\nfound himself wrapped\nin politics. From the very\ncapitalist endeavour of his\nmassive Dangerous tour to\nRomania, three years after\nthe end to communism in\nthat country and depicted\nin Last Days of Michael\nJackson in Bucharest by\nDan Mihaltianu, to the\n\u2018Earth Song\u2019 being played\nbackwards in The Body\nSong, indicating that the\nmessage of the song \u2013 to\nend damage to the Earth\nand people \u2013 was in part\nreversed by him. Michael\nhas been at the forefront\nof such matters and has\nbeen noted by such artists\nin their work.\nGiven all of his success-es, this is why the People\nv. Jackson case was so\nrole in fashion, art and\nfilm \u2013 Michael Jackson\nworked hard for his\nadoration. However, his\ncourt trial, his addictions\nand the circumstance\nof his death provide a\ngrey area to this massive\nhistoric figure. Michael\nJackson left behind a very\ncomplicated legacy that\nis hard to unpick, making\nhim a fascinating enigma\nto this day. One thing is\nfor certain: this exhibition\ngave us space to explore\nit all again and was fully\nworth the visit.\nEquestrian Portrait of King Philip II (Michael Jackson) // Kehinde Wiley\nARTS\nFebi Sidiku\nArts Writer\nWhere?

Heavy and harrowing noise rock akin to a horror movie - not the\nsoundtrack, but the movie itself. Gore and all.\nP\nreface to this\nreview: I\u2019ve\nnever been into\nheavy music, but\nI love horror films. It\u2019s\nundeniably a bit insane\nto subject yourself to two\nhours of fear (I recently\nsaw Hereditary in the\ncinema and thought I was\ngoing to die), but the visceral emotion good horror\nelicits is what makes it\nso addictive. With this\nalbum I discovered that,\nsimilar to watching a\nscary movie, listening to\nterrifying music can be a\nlot of (harrowing and kind\nof traumatising) fun.\nI\u2019ve tried to listen to\nBlack Metal and similar\ngenres, but I\u2019m always\nput off by how disgusting\nand deliberately off-put-ting they sound: demonic\nscreaming, pummelling\ndrums, Satanic lyrics.\nIf a typical Black Metal\nalbum (see: Behemoth)\nwere a horror film, it\u2019d\nbe gory and vile, evoking\nemotion primarily by repulsing you. Hostel, Saw,\nThe Human Centipede\nare films that fall into this\ncategory, and I have little\nto no interest in them.\nIn stark contrast, You\nWon\u2019t Get What You Want\nevokes terror and nihilism,\nbut not by disgusting\nyou. Instead, it feels far\nmore psychological and\ninternal; nothing repulsive\nor gory happens, there\nare no demons or Satanic\ncults. Instead, the fear\ncomes from within, the existential horror that comes\nfrom facing your own\ninsignificance, feeling\npanic and despair at the\npointlessness of it all. The\nhorror is the knowledge\nthat everything can fall\napart, that you\u2019re only one\nbad day away from losing\nit all. This comparatively\nmundane and grounded\nhorror is evident in the\nsinging; instead of the\nblasphemous growls and\nscreams of Black Metal,\nhere the singer sounds\nhuman, relatable, but full\nof fear and pain, on the\nverge of breakdown.\n\u201cThere isn\u2019t\na glimpse of\noptimism or\nhope to be\nfound here;\nit\u2019s forty-eight\nminutes of\ndespair\u201d\nfour minutes consist of\nsparse, discomforting and\nerratic drum bursts, with\nanunrelentingguitardrone\nand disquieting lyrics\nthat fill you with dread.\nIn the final few minutes,\nthe song explodes into a\nhellish wall of sound, and\nthe insanity only increases\nfirst few times I heard it.\nIt\u2019s relentless and night-marish, and somehow\nevokes the feeling of\nbeing chased, or perhaps\nof running from yourself.\nAfter a few more\nintensely visceral songs,\n\u2018Less Sex\u2019 is a much\nearned breather, with\nthat are oddly pretty, and\nthis eventually transforms\ninto a melody that is\nlegitimately gorgeous,\nand feels like coming\nup for air after nearly\ndrowning in the horror of\nthe previous songs.\n\u2018Ocean Song\u2019 is an\nincredible highlight; a\nnarrative-driven sev-en-minute descent into\nmadness, telling the story\nof a man returning from\nwork and being overcome\nwith a terrible fear. The\ncosmic horror the protagonist feels is thoroughly\nLovecraftian; it feels like\nthe end of the world is\nnear. The instrumental is\nreminiscent of a Swans\ntrack, with a repetitive\nand hypnotising bass line\nand chanted lyrics that\nfeel like voices in the head\nof a man who has finally\nsnapped. The character\nsprints through the streets\nin fear, and it feels like\nyou\u2019re right there with\nhim.\nThe final song \u2018Guest\nHouse\u2019 is an insanely bold\nand horrifying way to\nend the album. The lyrics\ndepict a situation straight\nout of a nightmare;\nsomeone is pounding\ndesperately on your cellar\ndoor, asking who locked\nthem out and begging\nyou to \u201clet me in\u201d with\ngut-wrenching screams of\nfear and pain. The terror\nin their voice is palpable\nand awful to behold,\nevoking sympathy but\nalso visceral fear.\nThe surprising thing\nabout this collection of\nharrowing songs is just\nhow incredibly captivating they are. They\nare accessible enough to\nbe enjoyed, whilst still\ncontaining freakish and\ndisorientating walls of\nsound, evil twisting guitar\nlines that make you feel\nlike you\u2019re descending\ninto a bottomless pit,\nand desperate, emotive\nsinging that makes you\nfear for the man who you\ncan hear falling apart.\nI\u2019m terrified when I play\nthe album, but I\u2019m on the\nedge of my seat.\nI thought the Halloween issue was last week? // Ipecac\nMUSIC\nAlex Large\nMusic Writer\nArtist: Daughters.

For\nFans Of: Horror films; HP\nLovecraft; being terrified;\nOxbow. 48 minutes\nYOU WON\u2019T GET WHAT\nYOU WANT\nfalling apart, and there is\nno going back.\nThe opener, \u2018City\nSong\u2019, perfectly lays the\nfoundation for the horror\nthat is to come. The first\nwith the following tracks.\n\u2018Long Road, No\nTurns\u2019 is so horrifying\nand demented it becomes\nincredibly compelling. It\nalso honestly made me the\na dark, brooding and\nominous melody that\nsounds like an evil version\nof Elbow\u2019s \u2018Grounds for\nDivorce\u2019. There are brief\nwalls of chaotic noise\nThis album sounds like\nwhat it must feel like to\ngo insane. It sounds like\nthe quiet horror of an\naverage person\u2019s existence has finally become\ntoo much, their psyche\nshatters, and everything\nunravels. There isn\u2019t a\nglimpse of optimism or\nhope to be found here;\nit\u2019s forty-eight minutes\nof despair. There are climactic peaks of absolute\nmania and calmer troughs\nof quiet dread, but there\u2019s\nno escaping the overall\nmessage; everything is\nMUSIC\nFRIDAY, 9TH\nNOVEMBER, 2018 FELIX\nmusic.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n17\nAn album to cure your autumnal anguish\nT\nhe nights are\ncolder, the days\nare shorter, and\nthere isn\u2019t much\nnew music being released.\nGuess what I\u2019m most\nupset about. As the icy\nwinter chill grows, my\nmind has gone back to one\nof my favourite albums\nof the summer just gone,\nSlide by George Clanton.\nClanton\u2019s been creating\nfor years but mostly\nunder different names.\nAs Mirror Kisses Clanton\nreleased chillwave music\nand as ESPRIT \u7a7a\u60f3 he\nreleased vapourwave.\nIn Slide, Clanton draws\nfrom previous work but\nalso from genres such as\nbreakbeat, electronic pop\nand indie pop.\nNowthisisnotmyusual\nkind of music, but the\nmosaic of synths, beats,\nsamples, vocals and instrumentation is so intox-icatingly lush I couldn\u2019t\nhelp but become addicted.\nThe album opens with\n\u2018Livin\u2019 Loose\u2019. You\u2019re\nimmediately struck by the\nsound of glassy chimes\nwith the reverb turned\nright up, it\u2019ll reflect and\nbounce around the inside\nof your head in the nicest\nway possible. A sax then\n\u201cimprovises\u201d over top,\nfollowed by reverbed\nand echoed vocals by\nClanton. If heaven exists,\nthis is what you hear as\nyou ascend to the golden\ngates.\nAs the song goes on\nthe layers build, including\na dance beat and some\nnice gritty bass synths,\nand it gains a powerful\nmomentum; something\nClanton is really good at.\nNone of the elements in\nhis songs are especially\nloud or forceful but his\nskill in layering and\nmixing means that all\nthe pieces fit perfectly\ntogether to create a full\nsound.\nClanton also demonstrates impressive versatility between the styles\nof his songs. There\u2019s\na selection of more\nelectronic based tracks\nwith stretching synths,\nlow-pitched percussion,\ncatchy loops and swelling\nchoruses. Some tracks\nare more acoustic using\nlive recordings of drum\nkits and distorted guitars.\nOther tracks are ethereal\nin nature. The track \u2018Blast\nOff\u2019 has falling arpeggios\nand sweeping strings\nwhich work well as a cool\ndown from the previous\ntrack \u2018Dumb\u2019, which is\nthe roughest on the album.\nThe tracks \u2018Make It\nForever\u2019, \u2018You Lost Me\nThere\u2019, \u2018Encore\u2019, and\n\u2018Walk Slowly\u2019 all have\nthe same chord sequence,\ntwo of them share the\nsame BPM and almost\nidentical lyrics. However,\nall four songs manage to\nsound either somewhat\nor entirely different to\neach other. While this\nisn\u2019t executed perfectly,\nand does feel like a bit of\na cheat, you do have to\ngive credit where credit is\ndue, because I\u2019ve listened\nto these same four tracks\nmore times than I\u2019d care\nto admit and I\u2019m nowhere\nnear sick of them.\nAs much as I love this\nalbum it is lacking in\nplaces. Clanton\u2019s lyrics\ncan be interesting and\ncreative but the types\nof stories he tells don\u2019t\nventure out of love or\nheartbreak. Despite my\ncompliments about the\nalbum\u2019s diversity I can\u2019t\nhelp but want more. I\nreally do feel cheated that\nfour of the songs use the\nsame chord sequence in\nsuch an obvious way and\nwhile the sounds Clanton\nis working with are beautiful there is definitely\nroom for expansion.\nRegardless I love this\nalbum because it carries\na bit of 2018\u2019s summer,\nexactly what I\u2019ve been\nneeding to combat my\nwinter woes.\nSamm Henshaw takes us to church\nI\nrecently had the\npleasure of being in\nattendance as Samm\nHenshaw treated fans\nto a phenomenal one-off\nshow.\nSamm Henshaw rose to\npopularity following the\nsuccess of his two-part\nSound Experiment EP\nprojects, the most recent\nof which was released in\n2016.

    "content": "ISSUE 1704\nFELIX\n6\nPOLITICS felix@imperial.ac.uk\nAmericanMidterms:TacticalDefeat,Strategic\nVictory for the Democrats\nBelow their supposedly average performance, the Democratic Party have drawn the lines for\na win over Trump and the Republicans in 2020.\nPOLITICS\nJuan Rubio\nPolitics Editor\nL\nast Tuesday,\nAmericans went\nto the poll to\nvote for a third\nof their Senators, all\ntheir Representatives,\n36 governors and most\nstate senators and state\nrepresentatives in the\ncountry. The Felix readership probably knows\nthe two main takeaways:\nwhile the Democrats were\nsuccessful in their attempt\nto capture the House of\nRepresentatives (having\na net gain of 28 seats,\nso far, that gives them a\nmajority in the chamber),\nthe GOP was able to not\nonly maintain the Senate,\nbut gain 2 more Senators,\npossibly 3 when Florida\npublishes its results. Thus,\nboth sides could claim a\nvictory of some kind, and\nit is true that this feels like\na moderate success for a\nRepublican Party that has\nthe most controversial and\ndivisive president in the\nlast 70 years as one of their\nown. However, a more\ncareful analysis reveals\nthat the Democrats laid\nthe lines for an overhaul\nof American politics in\nthe post-Trump era. Let\u2019s\nfind out why this is the\ncase by looking into the\nmost important results of\nthe night:\nHouse:\nThe Dems have built\ntheir new majority in\nmainly three states (New\nJersey, Pennsylvania\nand Virginia), usually in\nswing districts where the\nTrump brand of politics\nhas proved to be toxic.\nHowever, they got surprisingly strong results\nin more conservative\nstates like Florida, Texas,\nOklahoma and Kansas.\nWhile out of these only\nFlorida will be in play\nin the 2020 election, the\nimproved vote share in\nTexas reveals that the state\nis indeed drifting away\nfrom the GOP, to the point\nit may become the swing\nstate by mid-century. It\nis also remarkable that\nthe Dems were able to\ngain districts in Michigan\nand Iowa, states they will\nmost certainly need if\nthey want to defeat Trump\nin two years\u2019 time. In\nother matters, controlling\nthe House means that\nNancy Pelosi will become\nSpeaker for a second time,\nand that the investigation\non Russian collusion with\nthe Trump campaign in\n2016 will have to pass\nthrough the Dem controlled House Judiciary\nCommittee.\nSenate:\nWhile it is true that the\nchances of them taking\nthis chamber were very\nlow due to the idiosyncrasy of the seats in play, the\nDems had a bittersweet\nnight in the Senate. They\nmanaged to flip Nevada\nand keep Montana, but\nin turn they lost Indiana,\nNorth Dakota and\nMissouri, and possibly\nFlorida, according go\nprovisional results. Particularly painful were the\nclose defeats in Arizona\nand Texas (the last one a\nnail-biting battle between\nprogressive darling and\nfuture presidential contender Beto O\u2019Rourke\n,and alleged serial killer\nextraordinaire Ted Cruz).\nNevertheless, it must be\nremembered that these\ntwo states have not elected\na Democrat in a statewide\nelection since the 90s,\nso the swing towards the\nparty of Roosevelt spells\nof potential success in\nfuture races. The re-elec-tion of Dem Senators in\nPennsylvania, Michigan\nand Ohio also reveals\nthat the Trump takeover\nof the Mid-West in 2016\nmay have been a once in\na lifetime event for the\nGOP.\nGovernorships:\nBig night again for the\nDems, but it could have\nbeen even bigger. Pickups\nfrom the Republicans\ninclude Michigan, Maine,\nNevada, New Mexico and\nIllinois, and, more sur-prisingly, Kansas, a very\nconservative state where\nChris Kobach, the infamously xenophobic GOP\ncandidate, was defeated\nby Democratic rising star\nLaura Kelly. However, the\nprice of the night proved to\nbe Wisconsin. There, TeaParty-backed union buster\nand 2016 presidential candidate Scott Walker failed\nto get re-elected against\nschoolteacher Tony Evers.\nDespite these victories in\nthe North of the country,\nthe Dems were defeated\nby a small margin in\nFlorida and Georgia,\nstates where they run\ncharismatic, progressive\nblack challengers against\nGOP administrations\nthat have been widely\naccused of using vote disenfranchisement tactics\nto maintain their grip on\npower.\nOther results:\nLesser (but not less\nimportant!) races solidified the narrative that the\ncountry is moving left. In\nFlorida, voters approved\nthe electoral reenfran-chisement of more\nthan 1.5 million former\nfelons, while Idaho, Utah\nand Nebraska passed\nMedicaid expansion that\nimproves the healthcare\nof the poorest members\nof society. Among other\nprogressive initiatives\nthat were voted in include\nthe legalisation of recreational marihuana in\nMichigan; endorsement\nof a law banning discrimination against transgender\npeople in Massachusetts,\nand maintaining sanctuary\nfor illegal immigrants in\nOregon. Last but not least,\nGOP-controlled Arkansas\nand Missouri voted to\nsubstantially raise the\nminimum wage.\nThe never ending fight. // Flickr\n\u201cThe Dems\nhave built their\nHouse majority\nin mainly\nthree states\n(New Jersey,\nPennsylvania\nand Virginia),\nusually in\nswing districts\nwhere the\nTrump brand is\ntoxic.\u201d\n\u201cPickups\nfrom the\nRepublicans\ninclude\nMichigan,\nMaine,\nNevada, Ne\nMexico and\nIllinois.\u201d\n\u201cA more\ncareful\nanalysis\nreveals that\nthe Democrats\nlaid the lines\nfor an overhaul\nof American\npolitics in the\npost-Trump\nera.\u201c\n\n"

The team was also\nmade up of a fair share\nof dodgeball freshers. For\nmany, this was their first\nouting.\nStrong leadership\nfrom team captain Philip\nZeeuw, as well as excellent agile dodging from\nJinay Patel gave the boys\na fighting chance, but\nbeing placed in a very\nstrong group, the boys\nstruggled to match the\nmore experienced teams\nand in each game were\neventually overcome.\nWith hope beginning\nto fade, a special call was\nmade to introduce some\nmuch-needed energy into\ntheir game: \u201cYEET\u201d. It\nwas believed shouting\nthis as they threw would\nmuch improve their game.\nFresher Flo Ruja was the\nfirst to try.\nHe throws silently. Hit!\nHe throws normally\nagain. Hit!\nHe throws once\nmore whilst screaming\n\u201cYEEET!\u201d. Miss.\nPerhaps not then.\nThe 2nd team finished a\nrespectable 10th.\nLast to start that day\nwere the Men\u2019s 1s.\nHaving come 4th in the\nUK last year, they were\nhoping for one of the top\nrankings. With James\nRice-Mellor playing\nblissfully unaware of\nany of the team\u2019s tactics,\nNithin Thoppuram twice\nsmashing the glasses off\na poor opposing player,\nand Lochlann Allison\u2019s\naerobatic dancing dodge\nconfusing the opposition\ninto committing a fault,\nthe team advanced to the\nfinal unbeaten.\nUnfortunately, they\nexhausting yet successful\nday, the team made their\nway back to London.\nWith a much stronger\nfemale presence in the\nclub, the traditional post-match KFC was replaced\nby calls for a rather more\nclassy Nando\u2019s.\nImperial Wolverines\nlook forward to this\nweekend and the commencement of leagues\nwhere the Women\u2019s 1st\nteam can make their\nleague debut and the\nMen\u2019s 1st team hope\nto defend their League\nChampions title.\nwere defeated by Birmingham, and finished the\nday in 2nd place.\nThe strongest play of\nthe day came from Rhiju\nChatterjee, who whilst\nball-retrieving tripped\nand fell over, yet did not\ncommit a ball retriever\nfault. Video evidence\nwill cement this event\nin history as one of the\nmost beautiful sporting\nmoments ever witnessed.\nShoutouts go out to\nMoM\u2019s Nithin Thoppuram, Philip Zeeuw and Ho\nYan Jin.\nAfter a gruelling and\nThe Men\u2019s 2nd team advance against Birmingham 2s //\nLochlann Allison\nThe debuting Women\u2019s team // Aqeilah Khan\nThe Men\u2019s 1st team pose with their silver medals // Rhiju Chatterjee\n\n"

    "content": "William Carlos Williams: poet, doctor, writer\nBooks Writer Claire Chan reviews William Carlos Williams\u2019s doctor-themed short story collection The Doctor\nStories \u2013 stories full of astute observations of human nature.\nBOOKS\nClaire Chan\nBooks Writer\nF\namily doctor,\npoet, novelist,\nplaywright and\noccasional translator \u2013 William Carlos\nWilliams wore many hats\nin his life as both a man\nof medicine and a man\nof letters. There seems to\nbe a strange compulsion\namongst doctors to write,\nas though their creative\nenergies need some outlet\nwhich medicine does not\nadequately fulfil.\nAnton Chekhov is\nperhaps the best-known\nexample; indeed, in\nhistory, his fame as a\nwriter has quite eclipsed\nhis career as a doctor.\nEqually, Williams is\nperhaps best remembered\nfor his epic poem Paterson\nor for his short Imagist\npoems such as The Red\nWheelbarrow. It is easy\nto forget that he also had\nan eye-poppingly busy\nlife as a doctor working\namong the poor and disenfranchised in northern\nNew Jersey. He would\nwork during the day and\nwrite at night, scribbling\ndown images and bits of\nverse as they occurred to\nhim alongside patients\u2019\nclinical notes. For him,\n\u201cthe one (medicine)\nnourish[ed] the other\n(writing)\u201d. \u201c[Medicine]\nwas,\u201d he wrote, \u201cmy very\nfood and drink, the very\nthing that made it possible\nfor me to write.\u201d\nThe Doctor Stories is\na selection of precisely\nthose of his works that\ndraw most upon his\nexperiences as a doctor.\nAs Williams wrote in his\nessay \u2018The Practice\u2019 (part\nof his autobiography),\nthe relationship between\nphysician and patient is an\nextraordinary one. Each\nindividual patient, from\nthe highest to the lowest,\nat some point \u201cexhibits\nhimself\u201d to the doctor,\nseeking advice. The\ndoctor is thus privy to, and\nis able to reveal, the \u201cinner\nsecrets\u201d of their \u201cmost\nprivate moments\u201d. What\na parade, what a spectacle\n\u201cWhat a\nparade, what\na spectacle\nof life passes\nbefore the\ngaze of a\ndoctor!\u201d\n\u201cThis\nanthology\nbrings a\nvaluable\nperspective to\nWilliams as the\ndoctor-writer\u201d\nof life passes before the\ngaze of a doctor! Birth\nand death, illness and\nconvalescence; the great\nand small tragedies and\ntriumphs of life are all put\non display.\nWitnessing all of this,\nthe doctor-writer is able\nto catch a glimpse of the\n\u201cunderground stream\u201d \u2013\nthe hidden thoughts, motivations and emotions that\nare the foundation of a\nperson\u2019s very existence. It\nis these flashes of insight,\nthese little windows into\nthe human condition, that\nWilliams recognised in\nhis day-to-day work and\nsought to record in his\nwriting.\nNorthern New Jersey\nwas not a glamorous\nplace to work, and the\ncharacters and situations\nin Williams\u2019s stories\nreflect the environs of his\nmedical practice. In The\nGirl With A Pimply Face,\na doctor treats a poor\nfamily, even admiring the\nstraight-talking frankness\nof the young daughter,\nonly to be told later by a\ncolleague that they are\n\u201cslick operators\u201d and \u201ca\ncrew of bad actors\u2019\u2019who\nare out to prey on his\nsympathy. Pulled from\nreal life as they are, these\nvignettes sometimes have\nunexpected conclusions.\nIn Comedy Entombed:\n1930, the \u201ccomedy\u201d is that\na miscarriage, rather than\nbeing a sombre and tragic\noccurrence, is treated with\nincongruous light-heart-edness and levity by all\ninvolved \u2013 except for the\nfather, who alone seems to\nbe affected by the gravity\nof the event.\nThe lens is by no means\nfocused solely on the\npatient. Williams\u2019s short\nstories reveal the perspective of the doctor, who,\nrather than a detached and\nomnipresent observer, is\nas much involved in each\nencounter as the patients\nthemselves, with thoughts\nand feelings that are often\ncontroversial or inappro-priate.\nThe Use of Force,\nfor instance, describes\nthe satisfaction, or even\nanimalistic pleasure, felt\nby the doctor on forcibly\nprising open the mouth of\na defiant child to reveal\nthe signs of throat diph-theria. Old Doc Rivers\nchronicles the decline of\na respected doctor due to\nalcohol and drug abuse,\nand the blind trust which\nhe still commands among\nhis patients \u2013 occasionally\nwith fatal consequences.\nThe subjectivity of the\nstories is brought to the\nfore by the use of the first\nperson and the constant\nnarration of the narrator\u2019s\n(is it the doctor\u2019s? The\npatient\u2019s?) reactions and\njudgements as events\nunfold. Interestingly,\ndialogue is put down\ndirectly in the text with\nneither quotation marks\nnor attributions to specific\nspeakers, making the\nreader feel as though s/\nhe is eavesdropping on a\nscene which is playing out\nin real time.\nA brief collection of\nWilliams\u2019s most famous\nmedical poems is also\nincluded. A Cold Front\npaints a particularly vivid\nportrait of a patient who,\nburdened by eight children\nand expecting a ninth,\nis seeking an abortion.\nLe M\u00e9decin Malgr\u00e9 Lui\n(after Moli\u00e8re\u2019s farce,\nThe Doctor In Spite\nof Himself) points out\nthe contrast between\nWilliams\u2019s reality and\nthe ideal doctor who\n\u201cgr[ows] a decent beard\u201d,\n\u201ccultivat[es] a look of\nimportance\u201d and \u201cnever\nthink[s] anything but a\nwhite thought\u201d.\nThis anthology of Williams\u2019s works by Robert\nColes brings a valuable\nperspective to Williams\nas the doctor-writer,\nparticularly the sensitivity\nand empathy with which\nhe met his patients and\nthe wry self-awareness\nof his reactions to them.\nThe foreword by Coles,\na doctor who was himself\ntaught by Williams,\nand the afterword by\nWilliams\u2019s son Williams\nEric Williams provide\neven greater insight into\nthe life and work of this\nremarkable physician\n\u2018of rare humanity and\nself-knowledge\u2019.\nThe man himself // Lisa Larson\nISSUE 1704\nFELIX\nBOOKS books.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n15\n\n"

Take Calum Drysdale\u2019s MirrorTestTM\nto see if you\u2019re ready.\nAnother week, another\ndate and another gallery.\nI got invited to go and\nsee the newish Space\nShifters exhibition by an\nold friend last Sunday. I\nwas running late and was\nrushing due to a highly\nimprobable coincidence\ninvolving a Sunday lunch\nand planned engineering\nworks. I had radioed\nahead from the impossibly slow Upminster train\ntelling her to go on in and\nthat I would catch her up.\nAll this meant that when\nI arrived I didn\u2019t do the\nusual straight-legged,\ncross-armed stroll around\nthe exhibits but instead\ndashed through the rooms\nlooking for the old friend,\nbarely registering what\nwas around me.\nI include the mental\nnotes I made. \u201cBig box\nthing, twisty mirror,\ndangly metal things and\nblokes walking around\nwith bedroom mirrors\nstrapped to their chests\u201d.\nIndeed, the mix of my\nhurrying and my last\nminute reading up on the\ngallery website about how\nthe exhibition explored\n\u201cboundaries\u201d proved to\nbe fatal when I reached\na completely ordinary\nvelvet rope barrier and\nI stopped to think about\nhow to get over it without\ndamaging the art. I came\nto my senses, phoned date,\nand we went back to the\nbeginning and strolled.\nThe exhibition brings\ntogether a load of artists\nto \u201cinvestigate space\u201d,\nand, though I cannot\nhelp but sneer, this was\nfun to go along to. The\nexhibition takes the form\nof a gauntlet of interactive\nand non-interactive (signs\neverywhere warn parents\nto keep their children on\nthe leash) pieces. The\nhour-long stroll was like\na walk-through Oz. From\nour yellow brick road we\nsaw all sorts of shiny and\nplasticy things.\nThe effect was largely\n\u201cThe hour-long stroll was\nlike a walk-through Oz\u201d\n\u201cReflective\nbowling balls\nlike edible\ncupcake\nsprinkles\u201d\nsuccessful, though it was\nsometimes hard to avoid\nthe comparison to the\nstrangest IKEA ever or\nan updated children\u2019s soft\nplay area, missing only\nthe rollers and the smell\nof piss.\nEffort had clearly been\nmade to make the whole\nthing very photogenic\nand Instagramable. The\n\u201cdangly metal things\u201d\nwere in fact sheets of\nsilvery chains that hung\nfrom the ceiling down to\nabout waist height, enclosing half of a ramp and\nmezzanine. The effect was\npretty and I would have\nspent more time thinking\nabout what the artist had\nbeen trying to do had\nthe whole thing not been\npacked out with people\ntrying to get the perfect\npicture. No sarky one-lin-er will do to describe the\nguilty parties. It seems\nthat polished metal links\nare what it takes to get\nanyone from parties of\nslightly artsy schoolgirls,\nto Eastern European male\ntourists in tight trousers, to\nhelicopter parents posing\nand trying to look #art\n#connectingthingswith-anonflexiblematerialwith-ahightensilestrength.\nSimilarly, the open-sid-ed interlocking cast iron\nframe boxes (\u201cbig boxy\nthing\u201d) attracted people\nlike flies to honey. The\nmain attraction to me\nwas watching people test\nout each wall to see if\nit was one of the mirror\nwalls instead of the open\nones. It seemed to take\nan incredible amount of\ntime. If you do intend to\ngo to the exhibit, refer to\nmy handy guide for not\nlooking like a tosser at the\nend. I suppose this is what\nthe artist was intending\nwhen trying to \u2018play with\nborders\u2019 but, like a child\nwho can\u2019t get onto the\nswings because the vod-ka-drinking youths are on\nthem, I have decided that I\ndon\u2019t like swings anyway.\nOnce past the\ncrowd-pleasers, the art\ngot more serious, and\nfollowing a red and bronze\nplastic handrail that twists\nand curves and explodes\ninto mad and tangled joy\non a wall. The incongruity\nand fun of it made me\nlaugh.\nMore dangly things,\nlike the earrings your\ncooler aunt wears, and I\nget my first proper look\nat the \u201cblokes walking\naround with bedroom\nmirrors strapped to their\nchests\u201d. Sandwich board\nstyle, these actors prance\nalong, reflecting things\nand getting in the way.\nFinally, the showpiece.\nAfter an hour\u2019s wait,\nRichard Wilson\u2019s 20:50 is\na walkway out into a room\nwaist deep in black oil.

    "content": "Misty\nN\never before\nhave the\npoliticsofiden-tity demanded\na spotlight in the media\nas they do today. Whilst\nthis is an undoubtedly\nrevelatory and welcome\nchange to Western society\nat large, room for the grey\nand blurred aspects of\nour inner selves must be\nmade. Arinze Ken\u00e9\u2019s searing one man show makes\nan admirable attempt to\nremind us of this point.\nMisty is a layered\nperformance. Initially\npresented as a musical\nnarrative describing the\nharrowing downfall of an\nemotionally vulnerable\nEast Londoner, the play\nis paused intermittently\nto give Ken\u00e9 the chance\nto address the audience\ndirectly and speak of his\ninternal and external con-flicts, largely in relation\nto identity, during the\nwriting of the play. We\nsoon see that these pauses\nform the \u2018real play\u2019 and\nit is certainly here where\nthe emotional weight of\nthe performance comes\nthrough. You will whoop\nduring monologues on\ngentrification, feel tense\nas his cranial writhing is\ndisplayed physically and\nbecome introspective as\nhe ponders on his casting\nas a \u201cblack playwright\u201d.\nDuring the main nar-rative, spoken word/rap\nguides us through London\nas the \u201ccity creature\u201d. This\nis a living being we are\ntold. A living being where\nthe \u201cblood cells\u201d and\n\u201cviruses\u201d (read: white/\nblack, resident/gentrifier,\ninsider/outsider) disrupt\none another\u2019s lives. This\nnotion of blood cells and\nviruses is a clever device\nemployed by Ken\u00e9 that\ngives him room to switch\nthe play\u2019s tearing focus\nfrom identity to gentrifica-tion. Questions of who has\nthe power to define space,\nblack trauma, notions of\ninsiders and outsiders\nas well as who is in the\nposition to frame such\nquestions are all either\ndirectly addressed or\nhinted at. A moment must\nalso be taken to pause\nand applaud the music of\nShiloh Coke and Adrian\nMcLeod that accompanies Ken\u00e9\u2019s witty, lyrical\nrhymes. Their jazz-rap\ntones and accomplished\nlive performances bring\nlife to London as a \u201cliving\ncreature\u201d.\nKen\u00e9 \u201cjust wanted to\nwrite a play\u201d. He didn\u2019t\nwant it to be an \u201curban\njungle safari\u201d but equally\nhe does not see why he\nhas to answer questions\non whether it is one.\nWhy must his role as a\nplaywright be framed in\nterms of his identity and\nskin colour? He does not\nwant it to be a complete\npolitical condemnation\nof gentrification, yet\nhe wants to present his\nfrustration that where he\nonce had local culture and\nsmall business, he now\nhas fancy coffees and arty\nstudents. The room for\nnuance that Ken\u00e9 claims\nfor himself, simply by\npresenting himself as he\nis, proves refreshing in the\nage of political extrema.\nThat being said, at\ntimes, particularly when\ntackling gentrification,\nthere is certainly more to\nbe said than the Hackney\nresident manages to fit in\nduring his 2 hours.\nUltimately this is an\nuplifting play presenting\nKen\u00e9 as his honest self:\na complex, talented\nyoung playwright who\ncan rap, sing and write. A\ntestament to nuance and\nKen\u00e9\u2019s talents, Misty is a\nrousing performance that\nwill have you humming\na tune and pondering\nsocietal issues as you\nleave the theatre.\nA Beginner\u2019s Guide to Porgy & Bess\nI\nwould like to start\nwith a confession:\nthis was my first\nopera. My first\nexposure was an amateur collection of arias\norganised by a friend in a\nsmall opera house in Italy.\nHer team\u2019s enthusiasm\nmade up for their lack of\nexpertise. Squirming my\nway through the first part,\nI fled to bask in the golden\nevening sun during the\nsecond half. I was an utter\nphilistine.\nFinally relenting to my\nMum\u2019s pleas to join her\nat the opera, I went to see\nPorgy & Bess, 80 years\nafter its premiere. Surprisingly, my neighbours\nweren\u2019t pretentious opera\naficionados, but fellow\ncommoners in jeans and\ntrainers. Perched on the\nedge of tiny seats, we\nheld our breath as the\nlights dimmed. The set, a\nskeletal shanty-town, was\na long way away from the\ndecadent, Renaissance\ntheme I had pictured. It\nwas stark, geometric and\nsharp. A melancholic\nvoice floated through the\nether. My eyes flicked up\nto a screen above the stage,\nwhere surtitles deciphered\nthe haunting soprano:\n\u201cSummertime\u2026\u201d\nThe tale of Porgy &\nBess is one of incomprehensible suffering, a community buffeted by the\nburdens of being black,\npoor, female, or disabled.\nThe plot unleashes with\nthe arrival of Bess (Nicole\nCampbell), the beautiful\ngirlfriend of ruffian\nCrown (Nmon Ford). Our\nhero, Porgy (Eric Greene),\nis a beggar on crutches, an\nincurable romantic with\nan invincible optimism. In\nthe heat of a game of craps\n\u2013 a brief respite from the\nensemble\u2019s wretched existence \u2013 Crown murders\na man, abandoning Bess\nas he takes flight. Cast\nout by the community, she\nis taken in by Porgy. His\nkindness and piety are a\nwelcome salve to Crown\u2019s\nabuse. Sadly, there is\nno space for love in this\ntale. To save Bess from\nCrown\u2019s claws, Porgy\nkills the villain and suffers\nthe subsequent destructive\nguilt. He is imprisoned,\nreturning to find that Bess\nhas run off with Sporting\nLife (Frederick Ballentine), a good-for-nothin\u2019\ncrack dealer. Porgy makes\npursuit with haste.\nPorgy\u2019s heartbreak,\nCrown\u2019s depravity, crack\naddiction, all these are\nrendered more crushing\nby the minimalist stage\nset and power of the cast\u2019s\nvoice. Yet the musical\nnumbers demonstrate\nresilience in the face of\ntrauma. From \u201cA Woman\nIs A Sometime Thing\u201d to\n\u201cIt Ain\u2019t Necessarily So\u201d,\nthe orchestra used the\nmelody of spirituals and\nseductive jazz to tease the\naudience with glimmers\nof hope. But just as you\nstart swinging to the\ndouble entendres, your\nheart skips a beat as the\ncommunity reels from a\nvicious storm.\nThe English National\nOpera has its critics,\nthough. As a host to\nexclusively English-language performances,\nENO is accused by purists\nof sullying the status\nquo of opera performed\nin the language it was\ncomposed in. Thankfully,\nPorgy & Bess evades\nthese expectations. The\nbattle between tradition\nand accessibility rages\non. Yet, this particular\nperformance\u2019s weaknesses extend beyond general\npedantry. Even to my\nuntrained ear, Greene and\nCampbell\u2019s voices were\noutshone by those of their\nsupporting cast, especially\nLatonia Moore as Serena\nand Donovan Singletary\nas Jake. At times, Campbell\u2019s soprano was more\nMiss Piggy than Miss\nPorgy. Thankfully the\nperformance is absolved,\nsaved, and ameliorated\nby the skill of the other\nsingers, music, and stage\nsetting.\nThe poignant story,\nthe musical harmony of\nvoice and instrument and\naccessibility makes Porgy\n& Bess ideal for novices\nlike me. Opera should be\navailable to the masses, as\nentertainment, escape and\ninspiration. So, will opera\nalways suffer the vestiges\nof snobbery? Well, it ain\u2019t\nnecessarily so!\nArinze Ken\u00e9 in Misty // Helen Murray\nARTS\nFRIDAY, 9TH\nNOVEMBER, 2018 FELIX\n22\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nARTS\nCalvin Nesbitt\nArts Writer\nWhere?

Eleven\nmembers of the Tree of\nLife synagogue, located in\nPittsburgh, Pennsylvania,\nhad their Saturday prayers\ncut tragically short. The\ndetails of the crime are\ngruesome, as with many\nmass shootings, but the\nprofoundly bitter (but\nall too familiar) taste of\nbanality lingers over the\nair.\nAlthough an important\naspect of this atrocity is\nthe lack of control around\nfirearms that has enabled\nso many tragedies in\nthe past decade, there is\nanother aspect that is just\nas crucial and must be\ndiscussed: the victims,\nor victim of this crime,\nJudaism. The eleven individuals who tragically lost\ntheir lives were not killed\nby coincidence.Their guilt\nwas in their association,\ntheir association to the\nTree of Life synagogue,\nand their Jewish ethnicity.\nThe attacker shouted\nanti-Semitic slogans at\nthe scene of the massacre,\nhis online profile\nshowed various signs\nof anti-Semitism. This\nattack was anti-Semitic,\nor racist - the words can\nbe used interchangeably.\nHowever, upon listening\nto Donald Trump and his\nadministration\u2019s response\nto the attack, you may be\nforgiven for not being sure\nwho these victims actually\nwere. Trump, as he has\ndone at mass shootings\nbefore, used this tragedy\nto push his pro-gun\nagenda, claiming that\narmed guards at the scene\ncould do what a team of\npolice officers couldn\u2019t do\nand stop the attack. It is\nshocking that a man with\na Jewish son-in-law and a\ndaughter who converted\nto Judaism, thinks that\nthe historically anti-gun\nJewish community would\never be comfortable with\narmed guards inside their\nreligious establishments.\nFurthermore, Trump\u2019s\nCounsellor (spin-doctor),\nKellyanne Conway,\nreferred to the \u201canti-religiosity\u201d of the massacre,\nprovoked by late-night\ncomedy hosts. If a victimless crime ever existed,\nTrump and his administration seem hell-bent on\nproving that it does.\nTrump did condemn the\nattack as an anti-Semitic\nattack that attacked \u201call of\nus.\u201d This was a day after\nhis previous comments\nand the news cycle had\nmoved on. This is the\nproblem with the Trump\nadministration. If there is\none thing he is good at, it is\nbeing able to not alienate\nracists. Trump\u2019s claim of\n\u201cgood and bad people on\nboth sides\u201d after neo-Na-zis and anti racists clashed\nin Charlottesville still\nrings in many people\u2019s\nears. In this attack in Pittsburgh, despite the shooter\nclaiming not to be a\nTrump supporter, many of\nhis supporters have been\nvery receptive of the ideas\nthat the shooter had, an\nexample being that Jewish\nphilanthropist George\nSoros was responsible\nfor mass immigration of\nCentral Americans into\nthe United States, an idea\nthat has been floated in\nmany republican midterm\ncampaign advertisements\nover the last few weeks.\nThis makes it reasonable\nto conclude that the Republican Party is currently\na comfortable place for\nthose who can be told that\na mass shooting of Jewish\nworshippers is actually\nan attack on gun loving,\nreligious conservatives\nwho are the butt of Trevor\nNoah\u2019s jokes on the Daily\nShow.\nHowever, it must be\nnoted that the problem\nof how the Jewish community is perceived is\nnot limited to American\nconservatives. From the\nother side of the political\nspectrum, attacks on the\nJewish community have\nundergone a victim-blam-ing analysis similar to\nTrump\u2019s suggestion\nabout hiring security\nguards in the Tree of\nLife synagogue. \u201cWhat\nabout Israel,\u201d is a line that\nJewish people all over the\nworld are all too used to\nafter an act of anti-Semi-tism. As if a geo-political\nconflict thousands of\nmiles away makes an act\nof hatred a justifiable act.\nFlowers left at the site of the shooting // AP Photo/Matt Rourke\n\u201cThe Jewish\ncommunity\nhas received\nthe victim\nstatus that\nthis attack\nwarranted \u201d\nI believe that this criticism stems largely from\nthe fact that the Jewish\npeople, the Western\nworld\u2019s oldest minority,\nhas developed into a heterogeneous community\nover the last few thousand\nyears. Some have sought\nto retain their traditional\nidentity and others have\naimed to integrate into\nthe society they live in\nand attempt not to stand\nout. From intermarriage,\nto second-name changes,\netc., some members of\nthe Jewish community\nwere able to blend into the\nWestern society around\nthem. Coupled with the\ndeep connection to the\nfinancially and militarily\npowerful Israeli state that\nmany members of the\nJewish community have,\nthere has been a new\ntendency from anti-racists\nto dismiss the Jewish\npeople as a group not\nreally worthy of minority\nstatus.\nOverall, seeking to\nminimise the suffering\nof the Jewish community\nafter a tragedy is something that takes place on\nall sides of the political\nspectrum. In a macabre\nway, the Pittsburgh shooter\u2019s brazen stupidity as\nhe screamed anti-Semitic\nslogans at the site of his\nbloody mass murder was\nwelcome. It meant that\nthe Jewish community\nreceived the victim status\nthat this attack warranted.\nAny claims that this\nattack was some kind\nof payback for actions\ncommitted in a conflict in\nthe middle east were not\ntaken seriously, Palestine\nwas not mentioned by the\nattacker. Any claims that\nthis attack was actually\nan attack on the ideology\nwhere it could be argued\nthat this attack came from\ndue to anti-religious and\nanti-conservative fervour\nwere also not taken seri-ously. The attacker was\nunambiguous in his hatred\nand where his hatred was\ndirected. Even now, as\nthis article has mentioned,\nthere were voices seeking\nto minimise the fact that\nthis attack was racist.\nPerhaps the world, (some\npeople could argue the\nJewish community itself),\nmust decide whether it\nbelongs in its place as the\nWestern World\u2019s oldest\nminority.\n\n"

Let\nme preface this article\nby stating that I am not a\ndiehard Blizzard fan by\nno means, however I do\nconsider myself to be a\nsupporter of the gaming\nindustry treating their audience respectfully; this is\nnot what happened at the\nDiablo panel in Blizzcon\n2018.\nTo give you some\nbackground on the series:\nDiablo is a very much\nbeloved PC/ Console\nRPG series which has\nbeen ongoing since 1996.\nThe second game was\nreleased in 2000 (its expansion in 2001) followed\nby another instalment to\nthe series in 2012 (and its\nexpansion in 2014). Since\nits release, the series has\nbeen available on PC and\nconsoles, as such, you\u2019d\nimagine that they would\ncontinue such a trend. So,\nimagine you\u2019re a diehard\nfan of the Diablo series:\nAfter the amazing game\nthat was Diablo II and less\namazing game that was\nDiablo III, Blizzard announced that they would\nbe detailing news about\ntheir upcoming projects\ninvolving Diablo. It\u2019s\nbeen six years since the\nlast Diablo game, and\nsure as anything fans were\nready to sink their teeth\ninto another gameplay and\nlore rich experience, may\nthat be a remastering of\nDiablo II or a new release.\nHaving heard news of\nBlizzard cancelling two\nother titles - Ghost and\nTitan - due to them not\nbeing up to the company\u2019s\nhigh standards, fans knew\nthat Blizzard wouldn\u2019t\nbetray those standards,\nespecially when handling\nDiablo based content.\nWith hearts beating\nfaster than a professional Starcraft player\u2019s\nmouseclicks per minute,\ntickets for the upcoming\nBlizzcon were sold in a\nflash; if the fourth game\nor a remaster were going\nto be announced, people\nwanted to get their hands\non the free merch and be\nthere for the announce-ment. Tension being built\nup like an orchestra of\ndrums, fans entered the\nroom for the moment of\ntruth. The room descending into silence with eager\nanticipation of a new\nDiablo game or remaster\nfrom a barren six years.\nWalking onto the\nstage an announcer\ngreets the audience,\nsaying \u201cBlizzcon, we\nlove Diablo! We love the\nway Diablo has brought\nmillions of players around\nthe world together to\nslay Demons!\u201d. The hype\nwas immense, but then\na red flag appeared - the\nannouncer suddenly mentioned mobile devices and\nhow they keep us closer \u2026\nI mean it\u2019s touching, but it\ndoesn\u2019t seem particularly\nrelevant \u2026 you would\nthink? The screen behind\nhim changes, revealing\nthe newest addition to the\ngaming behemoth that is\nthe Diablo series: a mobile\ngame version of Diablo\n\u2026 just what no-one really\nwanted. After six years\nof waiting, the fans are\nnot greeted with news\nof a new game or even a\nremaster of an old one \u2026\nno, they\u2019re greeted with\nthe horrific trend that is\nmaking knockoff mobile\ngames out of major series.\nThe announcement\nproceeds with the\nannouncer saying the\nword \u2018mobile\u2019 so many\ntimes that drinking game\nfanatics would quiver at\nthe thought of a potential\nlast hurrah. Alright,\nmobile games aren\u2019t all\nthat bad, however, that\u2019s\nnot the problem with the\nsituation. The problem\nlies with the fact that after\nwaiting six years, these\ndiehard gamers were\ngreeted with a mobile\ngame that is almost identical in material to the\nprevious game, Diablo\nIII, as if to pawn off the\nprevious game as a brand\nnew game by changing\nits platform and putting\ndodgy controls on it. This\nwould be like having the\nnext Uncharted game\nbeing ported as a cheap\nJungle Run knockoff; and\nthis let the fans down.\nWhat is even worse is\nthat the company that the\ngame had been outsourced\nto,wasaChinesecompany\nthat had produced another\ngame recently that had\nan identical interface and\nsystem. Suggesting that\nthis \u201cNEWTM\n\u201d Diablo\ngame is simply a reskin of\nold elements taken from\nthe previous game which\nwas then applied to the\nChinese company\u2019s game.\nThe mobile game is the\nequivalent of Diablo 3\nbut with \u2018made in China\u2019\nslapped onto the back of\nit, as a form of off-brand\nknock off. But this isn\u2019t\neven the worst part of the\nannouncement.\nThe Q and A was\nthe pinnacle of how\nnot to answer questions\nfrom the audience. In\nsome hackjob version\nof Jedi Mind tricks, the\nannouncers diverted most\nof the questions of the\naudience, providing little\nto no answer other than\n\u201cplay the demo\u201d; when\nthey did answer questions\n\u2026 well, things didn\u2019t go\nvery well. Initially some\nof their responses were\njust bad; when asked if\nthey had a time frame for\nwhen consumers will see\nthe mobile game, the announcer replied \u201cuh, when\nit\u2019s ready\u201d. I know, such\na brilliant answer! The\nmulti-layered complexity\nof it had me taken aback\nas well.\nWhen asked whether\nthere were any plans to\nmake the mobile game\nplayable on PC, the an-nouncersusedtheirmighty\nintellectual prowess to\ntell the audience that the\nplan is to have it on IOS\nand Android, as if that\nwasn\u2019t (fucking) apparent\nenough at this point.\nThey then proceeded to\nstate that there were no\nplans to ever have it on\nPC, this was immediately\nmet by boos from the\naudience. They had an\nopportunity to comfort\nthe audience here, but\ndecided to blame the fans\ninstead by sarcastically\nsaying, \u201cdo you guys not\nhave phones?\u201d which was\nsimilarly parroted by the\nother announcers \u2026 the\nstage couldn\u2019t contain\nsuch genius in that single\nmoment.\nBut then, a legend\nstepped up to the mic,\nvoicing the thoughts\nmany had in their mind at\nthat moment, \u201cIs this an\nout of season April Fools\nJoke?\u201d. Which is met by\nmore more applause than\nthe announcement trailer\ngot. The announcers\nreplied and stated that it\nwasn\u2019t a joke whilst giving\nanother spiel about how\nthe game is on mobile,\nas if the first forty time\nweren\u2019t enough to hemorrhage it into your brain.\nIt\u2019s abundantly clear the\ndisconnect between what\nthe audience wants and\nwhat the panellists thinks\nis best, as they state that\nthe reason why Diablo is\ngoing mobile is to appeal\nto a wider audience, and\nget more people invested\nin the Blizzard commu-nity; they said this whilst\nisolating their diehard PC\nand console fanbase.\nThe announcers then\nattempted to cheer up\nthe audience by telling\nthem how great modern\ntechnology is, how their\nphones are so powerful\nand are more suitable\nfor the game than their\n\u00a31000+ gaming rigs.\nI seriously question\nwhoever thought this was\na good idea. For all these\nmentions of going mobile\nthey clearly weren\u2019t\ngetting any connection.\nThe calamity doesn\u2019t\nend there. The Diablo\nonline announcement\nvideo got immediately\nbombarded with dislikes,\nbut Blizzard\u2019s PR team,\nin all their bright mind\nglory, decided to remove\n100k dislikes from the\nvideo. But it gets better,\nafter realising that their\naudience must be wrong\nin their views, after the\nvideo getting even more\ndislikes, they deleted and\nre uploaded the video to\nreset the like/dislike bar\n\u2026 this caused an even\nharsher bombardment of\ndislikes. You\u2019d think this\nwould be the end of it,\nright?\nNope, in what seemed\nto be an interesting PR\nstunt gaming news feeds\nwere suddenly covered in\nnews that Diablo 4 was\ngoing to be announced but\nwas abruptly cancelled at\nthe last minute, which was\nthen reported to be false\naccording to Blizzard.\nBut something doesn\u2019t\nquite seem right, almost\nsuspicious. Some of these\ngaming news sites were\nof good reputation and\nunlikely to make such\na fuss out of a rumour,\nunless told by an official\nsource. From the great\nminds that brought you\ndeleting and re-uploading\nthe Diablo announcement,\nI give you the possibility\nthat the PR team may\nhave had a hand in this, in\nan attempt to mop up the\nmess that had been made.\nI mean surely something\nmust have gone right\nduring this announce-ment? I mean \u2026 nope,\nI don\u2019t have anything for\nthis. And that my dear\nreader, is the story of the\ndumpster fire that was,\nBlizzcon 2018\u2019s Diablo\nannouncement.\nBlizzcon 2018 Diablo Immortal Announcement // Blizzard\nISSUE 1704\n\n"

Similar packages\nwere quickly discovered,\naddressed to:\nGeorge Soros: billionaire investor and Democratic mega-donor\nJohn Brennan: former\nCIA Director (the package\nwas found in CNN\u2019s Manhattan office, which was\nthen evacuated)\nEric Holder: former\nAttorney General (the\npackage was misad-dressed and found at the\noffice of Democratic\nCongresswoman Debbie\nWasserman Schultz in\nFlorida, which was the\nreturn address listed on all\nthe packages)\nMaxine Waters: Democratic Representative\nfrom California (two\npackages were addressed\nto her)\nJoe Biden: former\nDemocratic Vice President\nRobert De Niro: actor,\nwho has been highly\ncritical of Trump\u2019s presidency\nJames Clapper:\nformer National Intelligence Director\nCory Booker: Democratic Senator from New\nJersey\nKamala Harris:\nDemocratic Senator from\nCalifornia\nTom Steyer: billionaire\ninvestor and Democratic\nmega-donor.\nEach of these packages\ncontained a pipe-bomb,\nsent in a padded manila\nenvelope, with the return\naddress written to Democratic Representative\nof Florida Debbie Wasserman Schultz for all\nthirteen envelopes. None\nof the bombs detonated\nand no injuries occurred.\nThe packages, when\ndiscovered, were immediately sent to the FBI lab\nin Quantico, Virginia for\nanalysis.\nOn Friday, the Justice\nDepartment arrested\nCesar Altieri Sayoc Jr, the\nTrump enthusiast from\nFlorida who had mailed\nthese packages. Authorities were able to pin\ndown his identity using\nfingerprints and DNA that\nhe had left on the bombs.\nHis social media accounts\nwere also used to corroborate his crime: his Twitter\ndisplayed misspellings\nof \u201cHillary Clinton\u201d as\n\u201cHilary Clinton\u201d, and\n\u201cSchultz\u201d as \u201cShultz\u201d,\nthe same misspellings\nas on the envelopes. His\nFacebook showed photos\nof him attending 2016\npresidential campaign\nrallies for Trump, underscoring the trend of\nwho the bombs were sent\nto \u2013 the targets have all\nbeen subjects of Trump\u2019s\nTwitter feed and rally\nrhetoric. Trump depicts\nHillary as a \u201ccriminal\u201d,\nGeorge Soros as an \u201cevil\nman\u201d, Robert De Niro and\nMaxine Waters as \u201cvery\nlow IQ individual[s]\u201d\u2026\nSayoc had been living\nin his van at the time\nthey found him. His van\nis plastered with pro-Trump stickers: a sticker\nof Hillary Clinton\u2019s face\nwith a target on it, \u201cCNN\nSucks\u201d, headlines reporting the jobs numbers\nTrump has boosted. He\nwas also reported to have\na hit list of a hundred\npotential targets.\nIt seems no surprise\nthat it was a man like\nSayoc behind these attempted bombings. The\nmainstream media is often\na maelstrom of heated\nrhetoric, where the words\nare acknowledged and\nunderstood for what they\nare \u2013 just rhetoric. There\nare, however, people\nlike Sayoc who have a\nblurred sense of where\nthe boundary lies between\nreality and rhetoric, who\ntake everything word for\nword, who are mentally\nsusceptible to extreme\nsuggestions and are\nprompted to act on them.\nA look into Sayoc\u2019s life\nproves this easily. Sayoc\nhas travelled the country\nleading a mixed-race\ntroupe of male exotic\ndancers; he has had\nmultiple run-ins with the\nlaw which included past\nattempted bombings; he\nonce filed for bankrupt-cy, and revealed on the\nbankruptcy filing that\nhe lived with his mother\nand owned no furniture\n(he is 57 years old); his\nmothers and sisters have\nencouraged him to seek\nmedical treatment for his\n\u201clack of comprehension\nof reality\u201d. The Justice\nDepartment had found and\narrested Sayoc at a strip\nclub where he worked as\na DJ.\nThis is not to say that\nmentally susceptible\npeople are to blame and\nthe American political\natmosphere should not be\ntoned down on both sides.\nThe rhetoric on both\nsides needs urgently to be\ncooled down. Before the\nperpetrator\u2019s identity had\nbeen revealed, Republicans were certain that the\nbombs were a false-flag\noperation orchestrated\nby Democrats \u2013 meaning\nthat they sent the bombs\nto themselves \u2013 in order\nto boost mid-term results,\nand liberals were quick to\nblame Trump as the direct\nand only cause of these\nattempted bombings.\nIn characteristic\nfashion, both sides had\npushed the blame onto\neach other without seeing\nthat their reaction only\nspurs further rage across\nthe aisle. The immediate\naccusation from Republicans that it was a false\nflag-operation allows\nright-wingers to believe\nthat ill will can only exist\nin people who disagree\nwith them. The claims\nfrom Democrats that\nTrump, and only Trump,\nis responsible for spreading charged and hostile\nrhetoric is hypocritical;\nHillary Clinton said in\na speech on the 10th of\nOctober, only two weeks\nbefore the pipe-bombs,\n\u201cyou cannot be civil with\na political party that wants\nto destroy what you stand\nfor\u201d.\nFurthermore, though\nthis level of political\nviolence has reached a\nnew high, its history has\nnot been exclusive to\neither side of the spectrum.\nIn 2017, left-wing activist\nJames Hodgkinson shot\nat Congressman Steve\nScalise during a Congressional baseball practice\nsession. Hodgkinson had\nattended presidential\ncampaign rallies for\nBernie Sanders in 2016,\nand was a member of\nmultiple Facebook groups\nsuch as \u201cThe Road To Hell\nIs Paved With Republicans\u201d. More recently, in\nSeptember, a Californian\nman was indicted for\nmaking numerous calls\nto The Boston Globe\nthreatening to shoot and\nkill their journalists. His\nreasons, as explained\nby him, were \u201cbecause\nyou are the enemy of the\npeople . . . as long as you\nkeep attacking the president\u2026 I will continue to\nthreat, harass, and annoy\nthe Boston Globe.\u201d\nThese 13 pipe-bombs,\naddressed to some of\nPresident Trump\u2019s most\noutspoken and famous\ncritics, would have seized\nthe spotlight for at least\na week in any other\ntime or country. But this\nattempted terrorist attack\nwas quickly swept from\nAmerica\u2019s attention when,\nthree days after the pipe-bombs were reported, a\nmass shooting occurred at\na synagogue in Pittsburgh\nthat left eleven dead.\nThe simmering rage\nof America\u2019s culture and\npolitics war has clearly\nhit a pressure point, a\nmoment that was likely\nprovoked by Brett Kavanagh\u2019s recent confirmation\nto the Supreme Court\nand the consequential\nmidterm elections that\nhave occurred this week.\nA symbol of democracy // Flickr\n\n"
