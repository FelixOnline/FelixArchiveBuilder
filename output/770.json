    "content": "Clubs FELIX, Friday May 8th198710 FILMSOC\nOrson\nWelles\nat IC\nThis Thursday (14th) IC FilmSoc\npresents Citizen Kane, in Mech Eng\n220 (doors at 7.30pm. admission free\nto members).\nShortly after the success of his vivid\nradio drama tis ation of The War ofthe\nWorlds, which panicked the whole of\nAmerica, Orson Welles. America's boy wonder, launched himself into\ncinema.\nIn Citizen Kane. Welles' first film,\nhe directed, produced, co-wrote and\nstarred. Although not a commercial\nsuccess at first (1941), even though\nit won two Oscars and received 5\nnominations, the film was soon re-released and became a smash hit. By\n1962 the British Film Institute poll of\ninternational critics had voted it the\ngreatest film of all time and every poll\nsince it has led the second place film\n(La Regie du Jeu) by a larger and\nlarger margin.\n\"Then last week, as it must to all\nmen, death came to Charles Foster\nKane.\"\nThe film revolves round a magazine\nreporter who interviews the friends of\nthe dead newspaper tycoon, Kane, in\nan effort to discover the meaning of\nhis last words. The film mirrors the\nlife of William Randolf Hurst who,\nin the first third of this century, was\none of the most powerful men in\nAmerica. Hurst spent a fortune trying\nto make a star out of his actress-lover\nMarion Davies, and their high profile\naffair was hot news for many years.\nKane is a brilliant piece of\nHollywood cinema, using all the\nresources of the studio, and despite\nlapses of character is ation almost\nevery shot and every line are utterly\nabsorbing.\nHere are what some more\nrespectable critics thought:\n\"On seeing it for the first time, one\ngot the conviction that if cinema could\ndo that, it could do anything\"\u2014\nPenelope Huston\n\"Probably the most exciting film\nthat has come out of Hollywood for\ntwenty-five years. I am not sure it\nisn't the most exciting film that has\never come out of anywhere\"\u2014CA Lejeune\n\"More fun than any great movie I can think of\"\u2014Pauline Kad\nAll members (and non-members)\nshould not miss this opportunity to see\none of the greatest films ever.\nMartin Gans\nPrice \u00a31.00 for non-members.\nAbba and GO 'Sullivan\nTonight, Friday May 8th, Ents are\npresenting the 7-piece band Hookline\n& Silverfish in the Lounge. The band\nhave been described as a cross\nbetween Elvis Costello and Aztec\nCamera and their history includes a gig at the 100 Club which was\nattended by a selection of record\ncompany representatives; which\nmeans they are as hot as a cross\nbetween the Smiths and a blowtorch.\nMoving further into the term, Ents,\nin conjunction with IC Rag, will be\nrunning a Comedy Cabaret Night on\nSaturday May 16th, again in the\nLounge, with a very cheap bar. Acts\nappearing include Scottish satirical\nsinger-songwriter Tom McEwan,\njuggler and funny man Steve Rowlings\n(whose appearances include Saturday\nLive) and the Music Hall Cabaret,\nwho describe themselves as a bawdy\ntrip back to the good old days. All\nthis, coupled with intermittent jazz\nshould ensure a jolly wild jape (and\nsome hints of wheeze).\nOn a more general note, the sad\ndemise of Ents activity this year\nincreases the importance of having a good committee next year to revive\ninvolvement in Union events. Whilst\nthe Ents chairman has been elected,\na number of posts are available and\nanyone can stand for them (Ents is not\na clique of hardy students\u2014we think\nAbba and GO 'Sullivan have really\ninjected life into the music business).\nThe posts are as follows:\na) Secretary\nb) Junior Treasurer\nc) Disco Officer\nd) Publicity Officer\ne)8 Ordinary Members (four\nfresher s) All C CU Ents officers are\nautomatically members of the\ncommittee. It is important that they\nattend meetings to prevent events\nclashing unnecessarily.\nElection papers will be going up in\nthe next few days. Anyone interested\nshould contact J Noble (Chem Eng\nIV) via the Ents pigeon hole in the\nUnion Office.\nLadies Rugby Tour Report\nLadies overpower Oysters\nAt the end of last term the Ladies\nRugby Team went on tour to Holland.\nThere were two matches played, of\nwhich IC lost the first, but came back\nto win in the second.\nIn retrospect it is not surprising that\nwe lost the first match to the\nEindhoven 'Elephants', after ten\nhours travelling and only two hours\nsleep. Seven tries were c once ede d in\nthe first half, but we woke up in the\nsecond half, only c once ede da further\ntwelve points and came close to\nscoring a number of times ourselves.\nThe next day the snow disappeared\nand it became warm and sunny.\nDespite the fact that a number of\nplayers had great difficulty in holding\ndown their breakfast (and one didn'tsu cee d) on the journey to the pitch\nafter the previous nights activities, we\nwere a much improved side when we\nplayed the Oisterwijk 'Oysters'. The\nteams were quite evenly matched, but\nthe speed of wing Sabrina Demello\nproved to be our strength and IC\nscored two tries in the first half, one\no eing converted by Abygail Samuels.\nThis'made the half-time score 10\u20140.\nThe Oysters scored a breakaway try\nnear the beginning of the second half\nas we relaxed slightly, But this proved\nto be their only score and after\nconsistent pressure we scored a try\nfrom a penalty move close to the line:\nfinal score, a14 \u20144 win.\nEaster\nrowing\nTHE EIGHTS HEAD\nAfter watching Oxford win the Boat\nRace, the 5 College crews then raced\non the falling tide to again\ndemonstrate their dominance in\nuniversity rowing, against 500\ninternational, club and university\ncrews.\nThe first eight improved on last\nyear's position and came 9th overall,\nwinning the Ortner Shield for the\nfastest UAU crew, and coming in the\ntop three of the British club crews.\nThe second eight also excelled\nwinning the UAU Trophy for the\nfastest second UAU crew. Possibly\nthe best result w as the winning of the\nNovice Pennant by the 'beginners' of\nthe club who have only been rowing\nfor 6 months.\nSCULLERS HEAD\n11th April\nThis is the top long distance sculling\nrace in the country and was attended\nby over 500 scull ers including many\nBritish and foreign World\nChampionship medalists. It was here\nthat the boat club had its best ever\nresult by as cu ller when Nick Barfitt\nwon the whole event, much to his\nsurprise, after having a very good\nscull over the 4 'A mile course.\nBEDFORD SMALL\nBOATS HEAD\n12th April\nHere the stars of the day were, yet\nagain, the novices, who won the\nnovice cox ed fours and cox ed pairs.\nThe cox ed pair's win was most\nremarkable as they were cox ed by our\ncoach Bill Mason who was larger than\neither of the two crew members. He\nthen went on to win in a veteran\ncox less four with his old friends. The\nother wins at Bedford were in Senior\nB cox less pairs and Senior C sculls.\nDAF and CHANNEL 4\nPOWER SPRINTS\n4th May\nThis event is the first rowing event\nspecially organised for television. It\nis to be shown on Channel 4 on\nSunday evenings during the summer.\nThe race is a500m timed trial with\nthe fastest four crews from the heats\ngoing through to the semi-finals.\nAfter the heats the first eight had the\nthird fastest time which put them into\nthe semi-finals. Here they raced the\nTideway Scullers School, supposedly\nthe top club in the country, but after\na hard fought race beat Tideway by\n% of a length, giving IC the fastest\ntime of the day (also beating the\nUniversity of London crew) and\nwinning themselves a place in the\ngrand final at Bristol on the May Bank\nHoliday.\n\n"

    "content": "Letters FELIX, Friday May 8th19872 Token\nletter\nDear Ed,\nWe feel it is our duty to warn fellow\nunsuspecting students of the dangers\nwhich lurk within Kensington\nGardens. At 8 o 'clock this evening six\nof us ventured out for a walk. While\n'8-wheel Jack' was razzing on her\nroller skates the rest of us engaged in\na highly energetic ball game!! During\nthe course of which, our ball (or\nrather, the tennis ball Natalie found\nin Linstead Bar!) was devoured by a ravenous flower bed, into which it\nwas thrown by 'Clutzy Charlotte'. As\nif this wasn't distressing enough, on\nreaching the gate outside Kensington\nPalace (with the intention of going to\nMacDonalds) we found them locked.\nNot wishing to forego the pleasures\nof a MacDonald's milkshake we\ndecided to scale the heights. This,\nhowever, is not as easy as it may\nappear.\nAt the sight of six worried looking\nfemales (due to the spikes at the top\nof the fence) a gallant drunken\nLondoner rushed over to help, leaping\nover the fence to demonstrate how\neasy it was. His over-enthusiastic\nefforts nearly caused a serious injury\nfor Jackie on the top of the fence, who\nwas posing for the tourists, keen to\ncapture quaint London customs on\nfilm. On noticing Jackie's precarious\nposition a handsome young man\nappeared, catching her, much to the\ndisgust of his girlfriend! With Jackie\nsafely over, the others were\ncommitted to following her. After\nsurveying the fence, Natalie (a life\nscientist and therefore able to find an\neasy way out of everything)\ndiscovered the simplest route,\nutilising the handle of the gate\n(no...the gate was locked). With an\nextra foothold it was now possible to\nnegotiate the obstacle with care (due\nto the spikes). Natalie, Helen,\nCharlotte and Jackie (now skate less) then joined the other Jackie on the far\nside, leaving Kate, wearing a skirt and\nscared of heights, not happy about the\nsituation. By this time the handsome\nyoung man had left (dragged off by\nhis girlfriend, who instantly\nrecognised Natalie's man-eating\ninstincts) and not even the offer, from\nthe drunken Londoner, of his back as\nan extra foothold was enough to tempt\nher over the gate. But, after a little\nmore encouragement, and one false\nstart, we were all on our way to\nMacDonalds.\nSo you have been warned.\nJackie (razzing) Godfrey\nCharlotte Green\nNatalie McGowan\nJackie Scott\nKate Whiteside\nHelen Waddington\n(Linstead Hall)\nULU Saved\nThe fate of ULU probably seems\nentirely insignificant to the majority\nof IC students, who consider even\ntheir own students union an\nirrelevance. Large colleges which\nhave good facilities, such as IC,\nfunction perfectly adequately on a day\nto day basis without the aid of the\ncentralised London Union. This is one\nof the reasons why ULU was open to\nattack when the need for drastic cuts\narose. Though the heat may be off for\nthe moment, there can be little doubt\nthat students unions will be in danger\nin future when more cuts are\nthreatened. Unless there is a major\nupset at the next general election the\ngovernment will continue to trim the\neducation budget for as long as they\nare allowed to get away with it. As\nUGC funding contracts, universities\nwill have to supplement their incomes\nmore and more with sponsorship from\nindustry and private research\ncontracts. Imperial already receives\na substantial amount of money in this\nway and the administration are keen\nto see this increase. More and more\nemphasis is going to be on\n'economically viable' research,\nmeans-tested grants will eventually\ngive way to student loans, and tertiary\neducation will move further towards\nbeing privately funded instead of\nstate-maintained. Science institutions\nwill no doubt do relatively well, but\nstudents unions will be squeezed out\nas government money dwindles, and,\nas usual, students will suffer.\nRag Fete\nTomorrow is IC's Rag Fete\u2014the\nmain Rag event of the summer and the\nlast chance to collect for this year's charities. On page 5 there is a short\narticle about the organisations which\nbenefit from money raised by IC.\nThis is the side of Rag which really\ncounts\u2014if you can take time off from\nexams, for Rag events try to get out\nand support this event and the people\nwho have spent the year organising\nfund raising events for your\nentertainment.\nPrint Unit\nThis is my 26th issue of FELIX and\nthe novelty is beginning to wear a bit\nthin. More and more, I have found,\nthe job is concerned with running the\nPrint Unit rather than editing FELIX.\nI do not have time to look after\npersonally everyone who wishes to\nmake use of the facilities, but I do not\nlike having the FELIX Office treated\nas a service which exists only to meet\nthe needs of club publicity\nrequirements. I will go out of my way\nto help anyone, but I do not like the\nimplication that people are entitled to\nmy attention, or, more importantly,\nto the attention of volunteer staff. If\nanybody is dissatisfied, Kall-Kwik is\non Old Brompton Road.\nCredits\nMany thanks to Judith Hackney, Dave\nBurns, Pippa Salmon, Kamala Sen,\nSteve Kilmurray, Chris Martin, Neil\nMotteram, Dave Williams, Mark\nCottle, Pete Higgs, Chas Jackson,\nAaron Kotcheff, Sarah Kirk, Liz\nHolford, Sunny Bains, Sundiatu\nDixon-Fyle, Andy Bannister, Francis\nMiers, Jane Spiegel, Grenville\nManuel, Al Birch, Christine Taig,\nDave Colley, Nigel, Rose Atkins and\nSteve Shackell.\nWARNING!\nTo all Union officers who wish to submit annual reports: The deadline is12.30 pm next Monday.

IC students and\ngood luck to those taking exams!\nNow, I bet you are wondering \"who is this\nforeign guy with a name that sounds like Zanussi\".\nWell, I am not a blok e with an endless list of Union\ninvolvements and certainly not a washing machine.\nSo do I promise limitless supply of funds to the\nCollege functions? or do I promise free booze and\nno work for you all? I'm afraid I'm not a magician\nbut I am an IC student, just like you, who believe\nthat something can be done to improve the life at\nIC.\nHow many of you attends U GM regularly?\nCertainly not the majority of you, I reckon. Most\npeople I 've spoken to felt that Union preceding s seems to take place behind our backs! IC Union\u2014'a faceless organisation' as described by the\nAlternative Prospectus. Why this is so? Union\nexists for everybody why not give priorities to\nSTOIC and IC Radio over other societies together\nwith FELIX so that IC students can be well\ninformed of what's going on. Also why not give\npriorities to Ents Society because its contribution\nhas a great significance to the life at IC.\nPRESIDENT Roger Loughney, proposed by Sri Moorthy\nUnion as an apolitical body and I oppose\nmembership of NUS, though I would encourage\na dialogue with other university unions; I am\nagainst student loans; I welcome the merger with\nSt Mary's Hospital Medical School; I encourage\nfurther links with the American colleges and see\ntheir presence as only for the better.\nWhat I offer, then, is communication between\nthe Union and its members, be it through FELIX,\nCCUs or more importantly on the personal level\nI will endeavour to be approachable at all times,\nopen to discussion of Union policy and willing to\nhelp whatever the problem.\nICU Sabbatical Elections\nVoting in all departments,\nTuesday May12 th and\nWednesday May13 th. Bring\nyour union card. Results in\nFELIX next Friday\nI also like propose the strengthening of lia sons with other colleges in London. How do we benefit\nfrom this\u2014facility sharing, livelier, social events\nto name the few, and also this would be beneficial\nto those who lives far away from IC.\nI will be around so even if you are white,\ncoloured, straight or gay don't be afraid to come\nand talk to me. I'm dying to hear your views on\nIC Union.\nI 've come to my 300-words limit so I like to leave\nyou with a proverb I like you to remember before\nthe election\u2014\"Heap big smoke, no fire\".\nCheers\nThe problem at IC is not apathy. Is it apathy that\nmotivates the members of the in umer able clubs and\nsocieties? The problem is one of communication\nbetween the Exec and the student body, and all the\nconsequences that this implies.\nFor my part all the energy and enthusiasm I have\nwill be channelled into creating a dialogue between\nthe Union and the student body. I believe the Union\nhas a duty to present the student body with every\nopportunity to debate policy. Once decisions have\nbeen taken at U GM, they will be per sued unceasingly. In dealing with student and College\ncommittees, I make it clear from the outset that\nI am not along for the ride, and I expect all those\nparticipating in the Union to hold their own.\nThe issues: as a manager in SAC for the past\ntwo years it is clear that the security of Southside\nis continually compromised, a wholesale\nreassessment of security being necessary; I am\ntotally opposed to any sale of Silwood land; I would\nencourage clubs and societies to find additional\nsources of finance by implementing their talents;\nI would seek to develop foreign students'\ninvolvement in the Union; I see the\n\n"

In The Big Knockover, the title\nstory of this collection, there are forty-six murders and at least fifty\nwounding s when a gang of one\nhundred and fifty gunmen take over\na San Francisco bank. Hammett deals\nin superlatives; his 'tec is the\narchetype, whiskey-and-poker,\nraincoat, dis-gusted with life and\ninvariably shouldering his way into\nthe most seedy dives. Indeed\nHammett did work for the Pinkerton\ndetective agency before and after the\nFirst World War. His dust jacket reads\nlike a fantasy;\nmessenger boy, newsboy, clerk,\ntimekeeper, yard man, stevedore.\"\nWho needs a degree? He died of the\neffects of TB accentuated by his\nimprisonment ten years previously as\na civil rights campaigner. His stories\nare wacky and varied\u2014there are ten\nin this book; murders in Chinatown,\non a millionaires' island, a wild west\nhick town that deals in illegal Mexican\nimmigrants. The backgrounds and\ncharacters are casually sketched in\nwith a few accurate colours of the pen,\nthe stories are enthralling and you\ndon't feel impelled to solve them\nbefore he does. This is a great book\nand nine out of ten cats said their\neditors preferred it.\nFILM\nWorking Girls\nWorking Girls and Personal Services\nare two films currently doing the\nrounds that deal with the subject of\nprostitution. On the surface they seem\ndifferent, but their cores are very\nsimilar.\nLizzie Borden's Working Girls is a documentary style 'day in the life'\nstory of a well run New York Brothel.\nIt is filmed almost entirely within the\nclaustrophobic apartment where no\n'kinky stuff is allowed (or, at least,\ncosts more). It is seen through the eyes\nof Hooker and Yale graduate Louise\n(Louise Page) who talks philosophy\nwith clients.\nTerry Jones' Personal Services tells\nhow Christine (Julie Walters) takes\nover from her prostitute tennant when\nshe moves out, owing 8 weeks' rent,\nand leaving a string of potential\nclients. Eventually Christine opens a brothel to cater for 'really kinky stuff;\nits clients are mainly diplomats, judges\netc. The film, as well as being\nconsistently and hilariously funny, cuts\ndeep into the hypocrisy of the British\nsex laws and our whole attitude to the\nsubject. As one of her clients said,\nwhen he admitted to his perversion he\nwas coming out of a \"very crowded\ncloset\".\nBoth Working Girls and Personal\nServices are firmly on the side of the\nwomen, who see sex as a commodity,\nin great demand, to be bought and\nsold. All are in total control of their\nown lives, minds and bodies and\nconsider themselves well above the\nmen to whom they sell their services,\nif not the whole of the male sex.\nChristine's bitterness finally breaks out\nfollowing her arrest; \"Men can't talk\na bit of sense 'til they're des punk ed\" she screams\" When their balls are full\ntheir brains are empty\". Louise makes\nher emotional separation from the\nmale sex more obvious\u2014her lover is\nfemale.\nAlthough both films are humourous\nand (dare I say it?) entertaining, the\nultimate mer rage of each is desolate,\ndepressing and empty, just as is the\nwhole subject of prostitution; it is\nignored or brushed to one side as\n'somebody else's problem'.\nLiz Holford\nFILM\nPrick Up\nYour\nEars\nPrick up your Ears is a film about a tragic love affair. Written by Alan\nBennett and based on John Lahr's biography of Joe Orton, the film\ncentres on the relationship between\nOrton and his homosexual lover,\nKenneth Halliwell, who was\neventually to brutally murder Orton.\nThe very fact that Halliwell's name is\nremembered today is ironic, since it\nwas jealousy of Orton's fame as a young 60's play write that undoubtedly\nplayed the largest part in driving\nHalliwell to kill his lover.\nIn recognisable Bennett style the\nfilm cuts un chronologically between\ntwo narratives, that of the Biographer\ncollecting information for his book and\nthat of the Biography itself, but\nconcentrates on the story of Orton and\nhis lover.\nThey meet in London while trying\nto become actors and Halliwell, an\naspiring writer, takes the younger,\nuneducated Orton under his wing. In\nthe early years the relationship goes\nwell while together they struggle to\nwrite, and amuse themselves by\ntaking side swipes at authority. But\nHalliwell becomes increasingly upset\nboth at Orton's sexual rejection of him\nin favour of frequent encounters with\npick-ups, and at his increasing success\nas a writer. It becomes clear that\nHalliwell is the real innocent of the\ntwo as his frustration and jealousy\nbring him to the verge of insanity, just\nas Orton is becoming a national\ncelebrity.\nThe film is ably directed by Stephen\nFrears, following on admirably from\nhis success with My Beautifull\nLaunderette and, like that film,\npresents its subject matter in a straightforward, no nonsense way.\nOrton and Halliwell are both\nexcellently played, Gary Oldman as\nthe irreverent and unsympathetic\nOrton, Alfred Molina as the sad,\nneurotic Halliwell. Bennett's clever\nand funny script offsets the depressing\nnature of the story and deals with the\nseedy side of 60's homosexuality\nsympathetically. All in all an enjoyable\nand reveal ling film. Presently playing\nat the Curzon, Shaftesbury Avenue\nand the Screen on the Green,\nIslington.\n\n"

The Central\nAccommodation Office and Health\nCentre are to receive similar increases,\nwhile the library and department of\nExtra-Mural Studies are to receive\nincreases of 0.86% and 0.35%\nrespectively.\nThis is extremely good news,\nespecially when you consider that the\nUniversity of London as a whole\nspends far less on student facilities and\namenities than the national average\n(1.5% of recurrent expenditure\ncompared to a national average of\n2.3%, according to the recently\npublished ULU document 'The Future\nof Student Amenities in the Federal\nUniversity').\nULU extends its thanks to everyone\nwho helped and supported them in\ntheir campaign against funding cuts.\nMeanwhile, make the most of the\nCentral University facilities while you\ncan; although things look rosy at\npresent there is no doubt that ULU will\nbe under scrutiny again in the next\nround of cuts.\nMore about ULU:\nThree ULU posts are up for election\nat the next General Union Council\nmeeting on June 2nd.

The two tracks\non the tape are the bands own\nmaterial, resisting the temptation to\nrecord a cover on their first tape. All\nthe usual you would expect from a 'rock' band is there, incessant guitar\nand drums, but what really lifts it for\nme are the lead vocals; they really are\nquite special.\nThe overall style, despite the rock\nstyle, can't help but remind me of\nJools Holland's band, Squeeze\u2014the\nvocals are very similar. Where it does\nfall down a bit is with the drums. I'm told they used a drum sampler, and\nthey didn't quite get it right.

The audience are\ncalled upon to give their (rigged) vote\non the ending, which is then acted out\nThe company pretended to be a fifth-rate musical company, a pretence\nthat did not stretch the imagination.\nThe experienced performers were\nobvious\u2014you could hear them. It was\nsad to see Ernie Wise, Lulu and the\nother passable actors prostituting their\ntalents to a bit of West End musical\nthat was neither highly amusing, nor\nmusical, nor well-acted, nor with any\nsign of a credible script. This is the\nkind of thing we send American\ntourists to (poor things) to earn our\nforeign exchange.\nSarah Kirk\nFILM\nCrimes of the heart\nCrimes ofthe Heart is a hilarious black\ncomedy which gives three of the best\nscreen actresses of the decade a chance to go wonderfully over the top,\nplaying eccentric (if not insane) sisters,\nwho refuse to conform to the rules of\ntheir community.\nBabe (Sissy Spacek) has just shot her\nhusband because she \"didn't like his\nstinking looks\", Meg (Jessica Lange) is\na failed singer who drinks too much\nand admits freely to having had far\nmore men that is good for her. Lenny\n(Diane Keaton) nurses their\ngrandfather and avoids men as she\nbelieves that they will reject her\nbecause she has a shrunken ovary.\nThe film concentrates almost\nentirely on the three central\nperformances. It quickly rushes past\nthe more serious points that the\noriginal play raised, such as hypocrisy\nand racism in the American South\n(Babe has an adulterous affair with a young black boy who is quickly sent\naway by the authorities when it\nbecomes public). Bruce Bresford's direction sometimes wavers\nsomewhere between the drama and\nthe humour of situations such as\nBabe's string of failed attempts at\nsuicide.\nHowever all of the film's faults are\nmore than compensated for by Lange,\nSpacek and Keaton's performances as\nthe sisters who love, laugh, scream\nand cry together when nobody else\nwill accept them.\nLiz Holford\nFILM\nPlatoon\nOne of the most publicised films of the\nyear, mainly, one suspects, due to its\nunexpected financial success in the\nUS, is Oliver Stone's Platoon. Yet\nanother film about Vietnam, you ask?\nWell, to a certain extent it is just\nanother film about Vietnam, although\nadmittedly a very well made one.\nThe plot is quite simple: the\nexperiences of one U.S. recruit,\nstarting from his first day in the battle\nzone. Charlie Sheen (looking\nincredibly like his father in Apocalypse\nNow) plays Chris, a college drop-out\nwho naively decides to 'fight for his\ncountry' and becomes one of the few\nVietnam volunteers. The platoon of\nthe title is that to which Sheen is\nassigned, a hardened, unfriendly\nbunch who, although be liev ably played, seem a bit clich ed: the wimpy\nLieutenant, battle weary Sergeant,\nresident wi erdo... etc. Sheen soon\nrealises his mistake, as a new recruit\nhe is not only given the worst jobs, but\nhis life is worth less since he has no\nexperience. As the film continues he\nis exposed to some of the other\nhorrors of the war: night ambushes,\nbooby traps, napalm, VC (Viet-Cong)\nvillages levelled and girls raped.\nThe comparisons with Apocalypse\nNow are inevitable. The films both\nhave a similar atmosphere and both\nportray the war in a black and\nun glorified way. They differ in that\nPlatoon tells the story of the standard\ninfantrymen ( who were usually the\npoor and uneducated men of the\nU.S. \u2014one of the original points the\nfilm makes) in their day-to-day\nactivities, although there is plenty of\n'action' of course.\nPlatoon is professional y made and\nis certainly exciting enough if a war\nadventure is what you're looking for,\nbut in the end I felt that I had learnt\nlittle new about the Vietnam conflict,\nor the suffering of the people involved.\nPlatoon is presently playing at the\nOdeon Leicester Square and around\nLondon.\nAaron Kotcheff\n\n"

The report says that these\ndifferences could not be explained by\ndifferences in degree class.\nDr Russ Clark is the head of the\ncareers service at Imperial College.\nHe said that he was surprised by the\nreport's findings, and that the\ndifferences could be caused by other\nfactors\u2014interview techniques for\ninstance. If there was discrimination\nthen he believed it happened at\nindividual interviews. He said that if\nany student felt that they were being\ndiscriminated against then he would\nbe ready to help. Careers services\ncould refuse to handle the literature\nof employers if necessary.\nIn two years he had received only\none complaint about racially\nprejudiced recruitment, from a Jewish\nstudent who had decided not to take\nthe matter further.\nThe standard application forms\nused for graduate recruitment include\na question on ethnic background\nwhich is designed to allow employers\nto monitor their recruitment to see if\nit is racially unfair. However this\nsection could also be used to filter out non-white students early in the\nrecruitment in a way that would make\ndiscrimination almost impossible to\nprove. This section is voluntary, and\nsome students refuse to complete it.\n\"It is up to each student to make their\nown decision about this\", Dr Clark\nsaid, \"It is a rather grey area\".\nAlthough the careers service\nhandles these forms and could do its\nown monitoring of recruitment of\nethnic minorities, this is not done\nbecause it is felt that the requirements\nof absolute confidentiality must be\nrespected, and some students from\nethnic backgrounds might not want\nsuch monitoring. For these reasons a decision has been made recently that\nthe recruitment of disabled students\nwould not be checked.\nAnother\nceiling\ncollapses\nA section of ceiling collapsed in one\nof the resident's rooms in Southwell\nHouse last week. At about 11.15pm last Thursday a3' x2' section of\nplaster crashed from the ceiling of one\nof the ground floor rooms and landed\non a bed. Fortunately both the\noccupants of the room were out at the\ntime.\nWarden Ken Young said that.the\nresident whose bed it was had had a lucky escape, as the section that fell\nhad been 'substantial'. He said that\nthe room had been in such a state that\nthe two occupants had been put up in\ntemporary rooms while the damage\nwas cleared. Mr Young went on to\nsay that Southwell residents were\nparticularly concerned about the\nsafety of the ceilings in view of a similar incident in Holbein in the\nautumn term. He was unhappy with\nthe extent to which the ceilings had\nbeen checked and went on to say it\nwas important for the safety of\nstudents that a full survey be carried\nout. Southwell and Holbein are both\namong the Evelyn Gardens houses\nwhich were upgraded during the\nsummer, although this did not involve\nstructural work.\nPeter Hallworth, Managing\nSurveyor of Residences said, when\nasked for comment, that he had\nexamined the damage personally but\nhad no idea why the collapse had\noccured. He said that with the age of\nthe Evelyn Gardens houses this sort\nof thing was to be expected. In the\ncase of the Holbein incident the\nplaster had been weakened by leaking\nwater but this was not the case in\nSouthwell. Mr Hallworth said that he\ndid not believe any further survey was\nnecessary and that anyway it would\nbe impractical to move students out\nof their rooms en masse.\nf women\nonly problem\nLack oi.

When examined by\nthe AP Editor, Sunny Bains, it was\nfound that the printers of Preston, had\nused the wrong kind of paper for the\ncovers and had not allowed the ink to\ndry before stacking. In addition they\nhad not cropped the booklets,\nallowing holes in the edges of the\npaper, produced during the printing\nprocess, to show on the finished\narticles, and had generally produced\na very low standard of finish.\nAfter Ms Bains complained, a representative of Hamilton Press\nagreed to take \u00a3200 from a total bill\nof \u00a31885 to compensate for the error\nin the covers, but was non-committal\nas to whether further reductions could\nbe made for the other printing faults.\nThe total number of booklets\ndelivered was 200 less than it should\nhave been, and at the time of writing\nit appears likely that ten percent of the\nremaining will be unusable due to an\nerror in folding.\nThe usable copies are to be included\nin the Sherfield mailing next Monday\nor Tuesday; it is expected that this\nwill be about six thousand.\nMs Bains said that reprinting was\nout of the question, as the Sherfield\ndeadline had to be met if the AP were\nto be distributed by College, and the\ncost of separate distribution by ICU\nwould be prohibitively expensive.\nNew Welfare\nAdviser\nCollege has recently appointed Mr\nIain More as Director of Public\nRelations.

    "content": "Manifestos FELIX, Friday May 8th19878 PRESIDENT Paul Bailey, proposed by Anne Driver\nHi! The fact that you're reading this at all makes\nyou a very unusual person at Imperial. If you vote\nin Monday/Tuesday's election you're even more\nunusual. Why? Because you've shown some\ninterest in the running of your students' Union\u2014\nan activity that over the past few years seems to\nhave all but died out at this College. There is one\nmajor reason for this change of attitude\u2014the types\nof students entering Imperial over the years have\nchanged whereas the type of people organising the\nUnion have not. There is no real feedback between\nstudents and the Exec, no matter how\n'approachable' they may claim to be, and so the\nExec, along with ents and other committees,\ncontinues to do its own thing. Many past Execs\nhave complained about student apathy but have\ndone little to alter the situation. One of my first\ntasks as President, should you elect me, will be\nto draft some form of questionnaire in an attempt\nto find out how you really want the Union's \u00a32m turnover spent. The President's main job is to\nrepresent your ideas and views to the main student\nand College committees, but how can your ideas\nbe known if you're not asked? The President is\nalso meant to be a forceful representative of student\nlife and opinions to the College block but too\nf re qu end y in the past Presidents have backed down\nto College upon confrontation to avoid 'trouble'\u2014\nthis means that you lose out, something that I will\nnot tolerate. Many Presidents have said this in the\npast but have felt obliged to be 'nice' to College\nadministration for an easier life. Who needs an\neasier life?\u2014I don't, and I 'll only be nice to people\nif students will gain from it.\nSo if you want your Union to show more interest\nin you, vote for Paul Bailey on 11th and 12th of\nMay.\nPRESIDENT Symon Corns, proposed by Alan Rose\nSince coming to College I have had active\ninvolvement in College life and hence I would like\nto see the Union flourish next year. For this to\nhappen the Exec must be a strong group with a strong President, able to lead and work in a team.\nI believe that I am such a person and hence am\nasking you to vote for me in the election.\nA major part of the President's job involves\nrepresenting all IC students on various College and\nUnion committees. To be successful a calm and\nresponsible approach is required. Further personal\npolitics or prejudices must not interfere with\nrepresenting the majority student view. I do not\nsubscribe to any political party and have a wide\nrange of experience on committees.\nThe Union has seen several changes this year,\nespecially in outlook, initiated by this year's Exec\nI would, if elected, give full support to these\nchanges and would try to use them to consolidate\nthe Union's strength. The Union faces changes next\nyear as well and for us to respond rapidly and\neffectively a flexible approach is required. Chas\nJackson and Alan Rose have already spoken on the\nrequired re-distribution of work amongst the\nsabbaticals. I agree with their ideas and will\nendeavour to have this redefinition of work-load\ncompleted by the end of next year by working with\nthem as a team.\nPlease vote and use your vote wisely!\nPRESIDENT Ian Howgate, proposed by Kenneth Young\nHaving worked with four of the last five Union\nPresidents I have no reservation in stating that Ian\nHowgate is potentially the best person I have yet\nmet for the position.\nIan's pedigree, unlike most other candidates,\nhardly needs restating, although his contribution\nin so few years bears reiteration.\n84\u2014 85 Captain of RSM Hockey Club\n85\u2014 87 Student coordinator of RSM Open\nDay\n86\u2014 87 Geology Departmental Representative\n86\u201487 Student Residence Committee Union\nRep\nIn my capacity as warden of Southwell House\nI have seen Ian's tireless commitment to all matters\nresidential, with a particular responsibility for\nsecurity (hence the Linstead Hall lock changes).\nHe is a gifted and confident orator, whose ability\nto cajole the opposition toward his opinion, yet still\nretain the essential element of cooperation never\nceases to amaze me.\nAs I have already said, a more confident, amiable\nand capable candidate I have yet to see. Therefore,\nI strongly advise all voters to follow my example\nand place a1 by Ian Howgate\u2014you won't regret it.\nI have many plans for the Union, most of which\nwould bore the average student silly, but include;\nUnion reorganisation, pushing for better\naccommodation and sports facilities, continued\nimprovement of College refectories and a drastic\nreorganisation of the entertainments machine.\nThere is far too much of a 'College verses\nstudents' feeling at present and these barriers need\nto be broken down so we can all work together for\nthe best results. I became involved in the Union\nlast year, because I and friends were experiencing\nlittle representation in halls and in my department.\nThe result was that I took up these jobs myself.\nI now wish to work for all of you to make this\nCollege a better place for everyone.\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX FELIX, Friday May 8th1987 Here we go again! Or \" a Miner's guide to\nvoting in\nICU\nelections''\nby Dave\nColley\nFor the forthcoming election for\nPresident of ICU there are five\ncandidates in the running. There\ncould be an election held whereby the\ncandidate with the most votes wins on\nthe first count ie majority win on the\nfirst past the post candidate. This,\nhowever, is not the case in ICU\nelections. In ICU elections a form of\nproportional representation known as\nthe single transferable vote (STV) is\nemployed to elect a majority winner.\nThe process starts with you, the\nvoter...\nThere are five candidates running\nfor the election. On the days leading\nup to the election you will\nundoubtedly read their publicity and\nask them questions. The forum for\nasking questions is the hustings ie\nyesterday, however there is nothing\nto stop you approaching a candidate\nto ask more detailed questions\nyourselves.\nOn the polling days there will be\na ballot box positioned in all\ndepartments. On production of your\nUnion Card you will be given one\nballot paper with the five candidates'\nnames on it in alphabetical order.\nNext to each candidate is a shortened\ndown form of voting instructions.\nWhen voting put the figures 1,-2,\n3, 4 & 5 in the boxes in order of your\npreference ie:\nCandidate 1 3\nCandidate 2 $\nCandidate 3 %\nCandidate 4 i Candidate 5 4-If in your opinion Candidate 2 is the\nbest for the job put' 1' in the box next\nto Candidate 2 (see above). Then put\n'2' next to your next best candidate\nand so on until you get to '5', or you\ndon't want to vote for any of the\nremaining candidates (leave the\nremaining boxes blank).\nIf, in your opinion, none of the\ncandidates are worthy of the post of\nUnion President next year, then you\nmay register a vote against all the\ncandidates by writing 'ABSTAIN'\nacross the ballot paper.\nThis is all you have to do to vote,\nand here is a short summary:\n1. Get off your backside on either\nthe 12th or 13th of May ie this coming\nTuesday or Wednesday and wander\ninto College, any department will do,\nor if you live in Princes Gardens use\nthe box in the Southside Upper\nLounge.\n2. Take your Union Card with you\nto show you are a registered IC\nstudent.\n3. Vote for as many of the\ncandidates as you want, using the\nnumerals 1, 2, 3, 4 & 5 to indicate\norder of preference, or abstain by\nwriting 'ABSTAIN' on the ballot\npaper (if any other mark is made on\nthe paper ie scribbling out and starting\nagain the vote is spoiled).\nDO NOT VOTE WITH A CROSS.\nPractice voting in this box\n\n"
